Oh, sod this.

Bedtime readin', I call it.

Bangers and bubble and

But, Sadie, what a night
I had me last night, eh.

You should've seen me.

You'll never guess who.

You know him.
He's agent to the stars...

He's down at Mr. Boo's nightclub

- Has that slight look of Elvis
about him.
You know him.
Everyone knows him.
And he knows everyone.
Eh, it was Mr. Boo himself
introduced us the other night.
- [Laughing]
- And two seconds, Sadie,
I fib you not...
two seconds
and his hand's on me ass.
My ass. My golden old ass
in Ray Say's hand...
while he stands there
tellin' jokes to Mr. Boo.
Well, I saw him again
last night.
Oh, the music was in our heads...
in our heads
and in his wanderin' hands.
He'll make it in anything,
Ray Say.
He's one of them lovable
twat sorta types.
- Drivin' me round
in his lovable twat mobile.
- [Screaming]
- He motored me round
about a million miles an hour.
- [Screaming Continues]
Me heart in me mouth,
his hands up me skirt...
- and me mind on his meat and veg.
- [Mari Yapping]
Listen. Then it's down to
the harbor for a pronto snog.
- [Squeaking]
- Oh, lip-lappin' like old hell.
But at least he knows how
to slide and dart and take a throat.
And at least there's the thick
wad of his wallet...
- [Squeaking Continues]
- Up against your tit for comfort.
Oh, up and down
and down and up...
and under the bloody stars.

In show business,

Shirley Bassey?
Shirley? Dear old Shirley?
Shirley, Shirley, Shirley.
To be honest, love,
as I remember,
I don't think our paths
ever crossed.
I did meet Des O'Connor, though,
and Charlie Williams.
Freddie
"Mr. Parrot Face" Davis?
I suppose the biggest name
I ever met was... Monroe.
- Marilyn?

You remember him?
The singing bus conductor.
No?
You like Marilyn, yeah?

- Can you do her as well?
Go on.
I bet you can.
Oh, well, there you go.

Listen, LV.
Listen.
You are my discovery.
I found you, right?
Me. Always remember that.
As a matter of fact, here.
Take one of me new cards.
I left it for you
in case I missed you.
Look. It's gold.
[Chuckles]
I wouldn't give one of these
to just anyone, you know.
Now, look. I know
you're a bit on the quiet side,
but I'm a big noise
in these parts.
And together... you and me...
we could set this place on fire.
You are a star, you.
You're a nutter.
No, it can't wait. No.
All right. Well, hold him there.
I'm coming down now.
Mari, you look...
[Grunting]
Don't speak
for a minute.
I, I gotta go, Mari,
but what can I tell ya?
It's happened at last, eh?
It's like at the races when
you know you're on to a certainty,
and you're feeling,
"This is it."
- She's the one.

I am the one?
- [Car Door Closes]

Honest, Mari,
I, I can't believe it.

You know what I'm on about.
Reading matter.
Ah, yes, you little bastard.

Oh, Jesus.

- Exercise?
Aye. You let 'em out,
they fly around and come back.
That's what homin' pigeons do...
except Duane, like.
- Duane?
- Aye... me best bird.
Not back from France yet.
What's he doin' in France?
# My heart belongs
to my daddy #
- # Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da #
- He's comin' back here.
- Oh.
- # So I want to warn you, laddie #
- Anyway, it can be boring
to the nonenthusiast.
- Oh, no.
- N-No. You're all right.
- When you let 'em go...
and see 'em fly, and better
still, see 'em back, well,
it's, it's dead exciting.
You'll have to come up there
with me, LV. See for yourself.
Oh, I, I don't go out.
[Sniffles]
- What, never?
- [Footsteps Approaching]
[Whispering]
I'd best go, Billy. Bye.
I'll see you again
somewhere then. Eh?
- # That little old man
he just plays it so good #
- Talkin' to yourself and all?
- Now were you?
- No.
Aye, well, I'm off
out on the razz.
You have a nice night
in with your pals, eh?
[Ray] Bloody hell,
where you been? I said 8:00.
Aye, but look at me,
luvvy, eh?
Takes time to get dressed up
like this.
Arndale Centre weren't
built in a day, you know.
- Yeah, and with half as much plaster.
- [All Laugh]
- You smooth talker, you.
- You know Mr. Boo, don't you, eh?
- This is Little Voice's mum.
- Oh, aye. Once-in-a-lifetime
thing, Ray tells me.
Never felt like this before
about anyone, he says.
Yeah, well, we'll get a few
quick drinks down us,
then it's back to your place
for a, a listen.
A spot of "Who do you do?"
For Mr. Boo, like.
- [Laughing]
- [Boo] What are you havin', love?
- Eh?
- Gin.
Double,
and a Campari chaser.
# And it's all #
# Comin' back to me now ##
[Mari] Oh, God.
You make me sick, you lot.
First that little phone fart,
and now you all droolin' over
that little stick of shite.
I got tits and all, you know...
and a gob on me
for every occasion.
Tits, gob and an ass
to die for, me!
- Good looker, eh, Boo?
- Just as well, with that mouth.
No. The car, Boo.
The car.
Oh, aye. Yeah.
Very nice.
- Put her in the back.
- I'm stoppin' here.
[Chirping]
# Oh, the chirruping of the birdies
on the sycamore tree #
# They're lucky to be
so happy and free #
# I know that they're chirruping
out a little ditty to me #
# I hear them saying early
every morn #
- # Get up, get up, get up #
- Get up, you.
- ## [Continues]
- Ray wants ya downstairs.
- What for?
- You know what for.
You've got him thinking you can
do something or something.
He wants you down anyway.
Show Mr. Boo what you can do.
- It's private.
- Private, my privates.
You're just damn selfish
and useless, you.
And you can do nothin' but whisper
and whine like your father before you.
Couple of bloody nothin's,
the pair of ya.
Look at it. Just a pile
of old junk no fucker wants.
- Now come on downstairs!
- [Gasps] Don't you dare touch these!
Ever!
- [Needle Scratches]
- [Music Stops]
Up yours, stick leg.
- [Mari] She'll not come down.
- [Ray] What?
Well, it's just like I said.
She'll not sing. I told you.
[Softly]
Dad.
Dad.
Dad.
[Boo] Well, I'm sorry, Ray,
but Boo's a busy man.
I've got to be off.
Got other acts to see.
Acts that can be bothered.
Night, all.
Boo! Boo!
Hold on, Boo. It won't take a minute.
Honest. She's dead special.
Listen, Say. I didn't get where
I am today by wasting my time...
By wasting my time listening
to singers that don't sing.
All I can say is that she might
stand an outside chance as a mime act.
[Electrical Crackling]
[Softly]
Dad.
[LV, Faint]
# Somewhere #
# Over the rainbow #
# Way up high #
# There's a land #
# That I heard of #
# Once, in a lullaby #
You know me, Boo. I wouldn't bring you
down here for nothing.
- You've gotta...
- # Where #
# Over the rainbow #
# Skies are blue #
# And the dreams #
# That you dare to dream #
# Really do come true #
# Some day
I'll wish upon a star #

- It is.
- # Over the rainbow #
- No.
Yeah.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No!
- [Ray] Yeah!
- Oh, here we go again.
- That's Judy.
- You got Judy Garland in there.
- Oh, aye. She's round here
all the time...
her and that Shirley Bassey
drinking our bloody cocoa.
You have a remarkable
daughter, Mrs. Hoff.
- Aye, don't I bloody know.
- Well, Ray. We must have her,
if you can arrange it.
There's the makings of a first-class
act there... real class.
- We could do a lot with that.
- Right, Mari, love.
Me and Boo are off up the pub.
Talk finer details
and finances.
- Leave the latch off, eh?
- What about me then?
Where do I fit in, eh? Need
a fuckin' second-class act?
Er, mine's, mine's a double Scotch, Boo.
I'll see you up there, eh?
- # Like lemon drops #
- What are you saying, Mari?
I'm tellin' you you're sittin'
on a gold mine...
- not over a bloody rainbow,
but up there in that bedroom.
- # That's where you'll find #
# Me #
- # Somewhere #
- "Dreams that you dare to dream," eh?
- # Over the rain #
- She can make them come true.
# Bow #
# Bluebirds #

[Chuckles]

- She's our chance, Mari.

long enough, you and me.
- Now's our chance to step out of it.

- Our chance?
- Oh, I'm going nowhere
without you, girl.

[Mari, Ray Laughing]
Love, luvvy. Don't worry.
It's only us... me and Ray.
- Coming bearing good news, m'lady.
- Stupendous news, actually.
Mr. Boo would like you
to sing at his club on stage.
- [Ray] Sing what you like.
- He'll pay. Good money and all.
- Could be up to 50 quid, right?
- Yeah, and that's just to start.
- No!
- No? Listen. Ray'll look after ya.
He knows all about showbiz,
and all you have to do is sing.
Sing!
Like what you do best anyway.
- You might feel shy.
- Oh, nothin' wrong
with being shy at first.
- It's natural, that.
- Had a girl recently
wouldn't say boo to a goose.
- Now she's toppin' the bill
at the Reform Club.
- Who's that? That stripper?
Yeah. Well, I mean, it's similar,
innit? I mean, similar case, Tina.
- Please go.
- It's not healthy being cooped up here...
Just go!
Bloody hell.
That's gratitude for ya.
You great long streak
of piss!
You are bloody doin' it, girl!
[Door Slams]
Come on. You can do better than that.
So how you all doin'?
[Muttering]
The manager says, "Do you want
that condom on your bill, sir?"
And the duck says, "Certainly not.
What sort of duck do you think I am?"
[Laughing]
Hey, true story, this. Two...
- [Boo Continues, Indistinct]
- All you've gotta do
is stand here and sing.
Like at home.
Just... stay calm
and relax.
What are you talkin' about,
relax? Look at her!
Think about... Judy.
Think about... Shirley.
Think about... Marilyn.
[Boo] Anyway, on with the show,
ladies and gentlemen.
As you know,
Boo braves anything,
goes anywhere
in his perpetual quest...
for fresh talent to spice up
your midweek merriment here.
And guess which exotic part of the world
I came across tonight's star turn?
- Shipley Street.
- [Applause]
Well, it saves on travel
expenses, don't it?
Anyway, pretty people,
enough of me.
A talent...
an undiscovered treasure...
an act of wonder,
ladies and gentlemen.
A little girl that's big...
a northern light... a rising star...
Order and hush.
Hush and order...
for the turn of turns...
a-the one, a-the only...
- Little Voice, ladies and gentlemen!
- [Applause]
Little Voice!
[Feedback]
[Whispering]
Go on.
You're on.
Go on. Go on.
Go on. Sing.
I'll do anything.
Just sing.
Sing, for fuck's sake.
Sing!

It's the lights.
Turn out the lights.

More? Do you really want more?
Oh, aren't you tired?
Well, we've got,
we've only got one more.
We-We'll do, we'll do,
we'll do "Chicago."

[Chattering, Laughing]
Thought things couldn't go downhill with
you, Ray. What am I gonna tell 'em?
Tell 'em...
she'll be back.
[Mari] Embarrassin'. One hundred
bloody chunk embarrassin', that.
I'm shown up, which was more than
she was, stood there in bloody dark.
- He wasn't there.
- And what was she singing?
What the hell was that?
She could've made an effort
and done some Spice Girls or
something, for Christ's sake!
I told you you was wasting
your time on the little slit!
She did the whole thing
to spite Mother. I know her.
Oh... go on.
Drop her off.
Dump her home.
Let's go eat.
[Pigeons Cooing]
- [George] Now then.
- [Gasps]
- Oh, Jesus.
- Guess what.
- I've just seen your bird.
- Where?
On stage, down at Boo's.
What?
Oh, no.
Not Duane.
I meant the other one.
That lass.
[Phone Ringing]
- Hello?
- [Billy] LV?
- Hello.
- Eh, listen.
I, I heard about
what you did tonight.
- At Boo's club.
- They made me.
- Who made you?
- Him and her.
They go on till you do.
They trying to make you
do it again?
Don't think she liked it.
Won't be doin' it no more.
Oh, but, Ray,
it were crap awful, weren't it?
Well, er, she's not
what you'd call a performer.
I-I'll grant you that, no.
But I can take care of that.
She just needs a, a big band
or something to boost her confidence...
er, a big, flashy set.
Bright lights, a bit of glitz,
snazzy frocks. All that.
I love it
when you talk swanky.
Has, has Duane come home?
No. No, no.
Not yet.
Happens sometimes,
once they're out.
Flyin' free.
They like it.
You should try it
sometime, LV.
- [Door Opens]
- Oh, I've got to go.
- I've, I've got to go. Bye.
- LV?
What was she like?
Well, if it's a roller-coaster
of unbridled excitement you're after,
I reckon you're better off
up here.
You're all right, love?
It's only me.
Been workin' on the act...
planning and that.
Got Boo to let us have another go.
I've worked it all out.
You'll love it...
everything tailored to your personality.
All you've got to do
is step on from the side.
What's up? Hey, angel.
You're not gonna let a little hiccup
like tonight put you off, are you?
That happens to the best
of 'em, you know.
If you could ask her
or her or her,
they'd all tell you
the same thing.
They've all had nights like that,
you know. Isn't that right, Judy?
"It sure is, Mr. Say."
And what about you, Marilyn?
- "Too, too true, boo boo be doo."
- Don't!
Seriously, LV.
It'll never happen again.
Not with this.
It's foolproof.
Believe me.
Let's do it, eh?
You won't even look at it?
Well, never mind then, eh?
Never mind.
That's it, then, eh?
No problem.
Pas de problemo.
Got it nice here,
haven't you?
Clean and tidy.
That's nice.
All your records
all around ya.
Your dad must have spent years
buildin' up a collection like this.
- He did.
- Yeah.
I'm not one for
collecting things meself.
Only debts.
[Laughs]
I had an auntie once
who was, though.
You'll never guess
what she collected.
Go on.
Bluebirds.
Honest.
Wild bluebirds.
Flyin' all over her house.
Marvelous with 'em
she was and all.
Even taught one of them
to talk once.
Timid little thing, it was.
No bigger... than your thumb.
Too scared
even to leave his cage.
But what she did
was so simple.
All she did was keep it
shaded and safe...
at all times,
and then sing to it
and stroke it...
very, very soft
every day.
And after a while,
it gave her his heart.
Later,
when it grew strong,
she set it free.
But before it flew
to its freedom,
it stopped...
on the window ledge.
Then it turned to her...
and, to her great surprise,
sang.
# There'll be bluebirds over #
# The white cliffs of Dover #
[Laughing]
See? There she goes.
True story, that.
Which are your dad's
favorites?
Them three there.
[Ray] Oh, good.
You know what we'll...
- Oh, no. No.
- What?
No. Well, I, I, I was just
thinking we, we could have
included them, uh, in the, er,
you know... the act.
But we're not doin' it now.
I bet your dad
would have liked that, eh?
A tribute
to his life's loves.
One love, his songs,
sung by his only
other love...
his daughter.
Huh? That would have
really been something, eh?
Yeah. A shame.
'Cause the man
and his music...
they don't get much respect,
do they?
You know what I mean.
- Ray.
- Hmm?
Nothin'.
Whoops.
There she goes again...
the bluebird under the moon
and over the stars.
I'll do it.
Do what?
Oh, that. Oh, okay.
- Just once.
- Yeah.
Whatever, whatever.
I'm pleased.
I'll just pop down
and get me cigarillos.
Won't be a tic.

Bunny "Mr. Starmaker" Morris.
Any new star you name,
love, he got 'em started.
He puts 'em in all the big clubs
and all the TV shows.
If he rates 'em, that's it. Nobody says
no to Bunny Morris, and neither did I.
- He's only comin' here
tomorrow night to see her.

Yeah, he is. He's comin' here,
honest. I gotta pick him up
at the Grand at 7:00.
- Tomorrow? We're on
tomorrow night and all?
- Yeah.
[Boo] Aye, aye. I've had to cancel
Silverados and Gringo Hodges.
- Had to. They were going
mad in here tonight.
- "Once," we said.
When Bunny sees her,
he'll do the same.
We'll never be off the telly. MFI
Friday, Letterman... he'll fix 'em all.

Today this crap-house,
tomorrow the bloody world.

God! The little bird's bleated
and died with all the shock.
It's all right, Mari. She's just tired.
Bright lights and all that.
Blessed are the meek for they shall
inherit the Earth. But when, eh? When?
- Don't push her too hard.
- She needs pushing. That's the point.
I've seen a lot of big talent
wasted in my time.
Don't come the fucking
impresario with me.
You run a club that no one
in their right mind wants to go to.
You tell jokes that no one
in their right mind wants to laugh at.
You're a nothing, Boo. It's me
with the contacts now, me with
the friends in the high places.
Remember that. It's Ray
who's the big shot. [Chuckles]
- Do you not want a ride home?
- Yeah.
I may not have friends
in high places, Ray,
but I've got 'em in
the fuckin' used car business.
[Billy]
LV!
I know you're there, LV.
You did it again, didn't you?
And again, tonight, it says.
LV!
LV, I'm worried.
Are you all right?
Look, just don't let them
do it to ya.
- LV, I know you're there. I just want...
- [Bird Flaps Wings, Coos]
- Duane?
- [Window Slams Open]
- [Wings Flapping]
- Hey, fuck off, Romeo!
You want to see her? Then sod off
down club and pay like everyone else.
Do without that sort of crap
just before show, eh?
When you need to be
concentrating your mind.
Come on, love.
Enough of this.
You've not opened your beak
all day to eat or to squeak.
And even you squeak
from time to time, don't ya?
Come on, love.
Squeak to me, eh?
[Squeaking]
[Squeaking]
[Cooing]
Duane.
Steady, steady.
Steady.
A long time since I've been
dragged down the Northern clubs, Say.
- Better be good.
- Oh, yeah. Great, eh?
Come in.
Now, then, I'd thought you'd be showin'
up here sooner or later. You goin' in?
Eh, don't know. Hello.
You must be George's wife.
Wife? You bastard!
- [Kicks]
- [Groans]
Sorry, George.
Sorry.
For one not known for his over-usage of
words, you don't half pick 'em, do ya?
- Spare ticket now if you want one.
- Sorry.
[Mari]
No, she's not moved, Sadie, love.
But she's going to have
to in a minute, otherwise
she'll be going on like she is.
I bet that Judy Garland never went
on stage in her bloody pajamas,
so I don't know
why she wants to.
Oh, Come on, LV, love, whatever it is
that's buggin' ya, just let it stop, eh?
Just for a few hours, 'cause, look,
we're cutting things a bit fine now.
Ray'll be here in a minute and
your mum's getting just a little
bit fucking irate, all right?
[Boo] Ladies and gentlemen,
will you welcome, please,
on this night of all nights...
the compare
of all compares;
the world's finest emcee;
the funniest man ever
to have been on television;
the man the Northern Echo called
"quite amusing";
the chuckle bag himself:
Your very ow-w-w-wn...
Mi-i-i-ister Boo!
- ## [Fanfare]
- [Applause]
Welcome to Mr. Boo's.
I'm Mr. Boo.
- Don't shout my name too loud.
I'll think you don't like me.
- [Man Groans]
- [Rim Shot]
- How y'all doin'? All right?
Come on. You can do better than that.
How y'all doin'? All right?
- [Scattered Shouts]
- That's more like it. Have we
got some entertainment tonight.
I don't know. Have we got some
entertainment for 'em tonight?
Of course we have.
And we all know what
that entertainment is, don't we?
Tonight, for the second
consecutive night in a row,
sees the return
of young Little Voice.
- [Cheering]
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
But that's all in the future.
That's to look forward to.
Ray's going to kill me.
He's going to throttle me.
Then what'd you be like, eh,
with me murdered? Oh, be up
and about, then, I suppose.
Happy as a lark. Oh, there be
no bloody croonin' for your dead mum.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no! He's here!
He's here! Jesus! Jesus!
Oh, come on!
LV, love, please.
Eh, do it for
your mum, eh?
Oh, do somethin' for me,
for Christ's sake,
instead of that lousy,
dopey drip of a dead dad!
Fuck!
Darling.
All right, Mari?
Okay?
Bloody hell.
This is it, eh?
Where's she then?
LV,
management is here.
Ray, love, there's, um...
a bit of a...
It's LV. She's dead tired.
She's really...
Aren't we all, love. She'll be
all right once she gets on there.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for our first act...
- five lads from Grimsby who have
a history of touching assholes.

I said "our souls," madam.

Did you get her dress from
the dry cleaners okay? Yeah?
Sadie, love,

- I've been so busied with her, Ray.
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey! Watch me furniture, you!
- Furniture?

So please give

Two things... that's all you had to do...

Oh, I know.
I'm sorry, darling.

your darling puss-puss.
- Never mind all that crap.
Good boy. Jump!
[Dogs Whining, Barking]
Where's LV?
Have you seen Ray Say or LV?
- No.
- Christ. Trigger,
you better string it out a bit.
- Do an extra five minutes.
- I'll do it blindfolded.
- Yeah.
- [Moaning] Oh, no.
- Sadie, give that
a once-over with iron, eh?
- Okay.
What? She's not even dressed?
We can't have this, Mari.
I'm gonna have to get
someone else to look after her.
Ray, no.
What are you sayin'?
Eh, you're too quiet to be
me friend, you. Fuck off!
Eh, I'm doin' it now,
Ray, love. Yes, I am.
So a big welcome, please,
to Wild Trigger Smith...

Don't spoil it, Raymondo.
We go so well together.
We go nowhere. For a start,
you're past it. You're body's gone.
When your clothes go, I can't keep
track of it. It's all over the place.
There's no way that
you're coming with me and her
to better things. No way, love.
LV! You got
ten fucking seconds!
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
All you're doin'
is gettin' in the way.
You were in the way
the first night I heard her,
and you're still
in the way now.
Christ. Do you think
I don't have birds I go to?
Don't you think it's like puttin'
me face in flowers after you?
You've had it, Mari.
For God's sake,
wise up, woman, eh?
Eh? [Whispering]
And fuck off.

No, I mean,

Oh, that's all right.

W-Why did you want

My dad used to

Listen to concerts.
LV, uh...
There's people other

and your nights...
of neglect!
Ohh.
When he had his records on,
he sparkled.
Not dazzling, like you,
but with fine lights.
Fine lights.
He never spoke up to ya,

never listen.
I never spoke up to ya,
