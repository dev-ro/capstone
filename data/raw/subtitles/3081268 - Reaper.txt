Reporter ( on radio ): It's day seven
of the nationwide manhunt
for the death cult congregation leader
known as The Reaper.
This man has been--
Female reporter ( on radio ): After a
freak power failure during the execution
at central prison, the reaper escaped...
killing several police officers
and leaving multiple
wounded in his rampage.
Former ordained minister,
The Reaper,
has been incarcerated and
sentenced to death
by electric chair for leading his followers
in what they called "healing parties."
( electricity crackling )
Female reporter #2: So, professor,
can you tell us a little about the victims?
Professor:  Well, the reaper's victims
were known to be convicted felons,
prostitutes, drug dealers
and gang members and that sort.
Female reporter #2:
Of the victims,
two have been decorated officers
under investigation by internal affairs,
involving a department-wide
investigation into corruption.
The governor has declared a
state-wide dusk curfew.
( shrieking )
( dramatic music playing )
Male Reporter ( on radio ):
What we can do,
is to advise people
not to pick up hitchhikers,
and to stay indoors
as much as possible, 
and stay off the road.

Natalie ( to machine):
Hey, Mom, it's me, Natalie.
I'm on my way with my friends.
They're giving me a ride
all the way to California.
Don't worry, I'll stay away
from strangers.
I promise.
See you soon. I love you.
( gentle music playing )
( brakes squeaking )
Hey, thanks for the lift.
Hey, come here often?
Yeah, they've got great sand.
( laughs )
So, are you gonna be
a smartass or a gentleman?
What's the difference?
A gentleman would have just
opened my door right now.
This is either my lucky day,
or you are gonna cause me
some serious trouble.
But be warned...
the air conditioner in this thing
is broken, so it's kind of hot.
Been drinking?
Only since I woke up.
( laughs )  Rum's really the
best way to the pass the time.
Well, I guess drinking in the morning
makes you more of a pirate
than an alcoholic.
Arrgh!
Let's plot a course.
As far west as my captain's
willing to take me.
You got it.
( country rock music playing )
Bill: So, what's your story?
Oh, are we gonna play the getting
to know each other game?
I like games.
All right, let's see here.
Searching or running?
A pretty girl like you hitchhiking out here
in the middle of nowhere,
I'm guessing you're
either running from your old life,
or you're searching for
your new life, right?
Yeah, I kinda like me as I am.
Oh, no complaints here.
But that doesn't mean you're
telling the truth.
So how long have
you been a salesman for?
How did you know that?
Beat up company car, old suit,
and I'd bet you'd have a conversation
with a brick wall if you had to.
I sell air conditioners.
But your own A/C doesn't work?
I, uh... in-home air conditioners.
Sounds fun.
Oh, it is. It's a hoot.
I love it.
Driving from one crappy town
to the next crappy town
selling crappy A/C units
to crappy people.
Well, it pays the bills.
Yes, it pays the bills.
Pays the Bill.   Me.
You got a name?
Sure do.
You gonna
keep me guessing?
I'll give you a hint:
sounds like "Sheryl."
 I like the sound of that.
Huh... maybe I should drive?
No, no, I got it, I got
it, kiddo, I got it.
( eerie music plays )
- Now where were we?
- I was about to get out.
Now why would you
go and do that?
Because you almost
just killed us.
Relax, have a drink.
( engine sputters )
Man. Not again! I hate this.
What?
Car's overheating. That's
why I don't run the A/C.
Well, can we at least
make it to the next stop?
You bet your ass we're gonna try.
I saw a motel back there.
Maybe we'll turn around
and go check that out.
( eerie music fades up )
( electricity buzzing )
( dramatic music playing )
( music continues )
( engine sputtering )
( exhales )
Car ought to cool down
in a couple minutes.
Great.
( church bell tolls )
I've been driving
since before sun-up.
I don't know, I'm thinking I
might just call it for the day.
Okay, well
I'm just gonna get out here.
and go hitch a ride
somewhere else.
No, no, wait, wait,
wait, whoa, whoa.
C'mon, don't tell me you're not
up for a little excitement.
Nah, I have hit my
excitement quota for the year, thank you.
All right, look. How 'bout this?
Go inside, we'll have
a couple drinks and
mellow out, you know,
just chill for a minute.
You know, hit the reset button.
Decompress.
And then if you want to go, you can.
Totally.
I mean, look, how bad can it be?
There's a church right
across the street.
Bill, I am not the kind of girl
that you think I am.
I keep telling you,
it's not about that.
I'm just... I know that
you are low on the money.
And... a hotel is here.
I'm not gonna sit here and
beg you to hang out with me.
You're... you're kind of
begging right now.
Come on.
( soft music playing )
( door bell jingles )
Bill:  Hello?
Is anyone here?
What's the deal with
this place, man?
Hello?
Brother and sister.
Oh, um... we're not related.
But you are here for...
...relations.
Correct?
We, uh... we... we're newlyweds.
Do you, um, you got
any honeymoon suites?
They're all honeymoon suites.
I've been spraying them down
and mopping them up for
the last thirty years.
Gross.
Well, at least they're clean.
We'll have one.
Cash.
Okay, cash.
Okay. All right.
( keys jingle )
Have you surrendered
your will to the almighty?
Yeah.  Yeah, man.
We're-we're practically, uh,
in church every day.
So room 7, right?
Of course.
Up the stairs?
Fantastic.
- Come on.
You have a coat check?
Sir?
Thanks.
Seven feasts...
seven sins...
seven plagues to do you in.
Natalie:
He's still staring at us.
( door slams )
Ha, ho.
Sorry, the wind must have got it.
- Yeah.
- Didn't mean to scare you.
I'm still, um...
...still just a little...
...stressed, that's all.
Well, you know, we can...
we can fix that.
Yeah, you know, we should,
uh, have a drink.
- Yes,           -  Mm-hmm.
 we should have a drink...
...for sure!
Well, there's glasses right here.
I'm not that kind of girl,
but,  that doesn't mean
I'm not a little bad.
Well, you know a little bad
never hurt anybody.
( Natalie chuckles)
Hmm.
( electricity buzzing )
- Let me go fix that.
- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
( Bill chuckles )
So, what are
we drinking to, Sheryl?
Ah...
to our honeymoon, Bill.
Our honeymoon. Yes,
our honeymoon.
Yeah.
Hey, 'til sunrise do us part.
Ah, yeah,  mmh...
Ah, yeah, it's... it's good.
So, are you still scared?
( Natalie chuckles )
Slow down, tiger.
What do you mean, slow down?
I thought that we were
on our honeymoon.
Yeah, so, what's the rush?
No rush, but I mean, we're here.
I've been wanting
to introduce you
 to little Billy
ever since we first met.
Stop!
Whaddya mean "stop?"
Bill, stop! What is wrong with you.
Bill, please! Stop it!
We're on our honeymoon, right?
Bill! Stop or I'm out of here!
You're not going anywhere.
Stop it!
Bill!
- What?
Don't be an asshole!
Yeah, that's more like it.
Do you want me to take charge?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
- Mm-hm.
Yeah.
How do you like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah, bring it!
I'm gonna make you
bleed, Billy boy.
- Aahh!
Oh! Ah! Ah!  Hit me!
Ah! Ah!
You like that?
More! Oh! Ah! You do?
Come on! Harder!
You like that?
Yeah, wait, wait.
Okay, you creep. Get up.
Ooh. I think I'm a little drunk.
- Sit down!
- Okay.
Sit down!
What are you d...
come on.
Oh! Yeah, all right.
Tie me up!
Don't go anywhere.
( chuckles )
Hey, there's no sex toys in there.
Come here.
Yes, yes!
Yeah, get in there.
Hey...  what are you...
what are you doin' ?
Oh, you've done this before.
You're right.
I have done this before.
( laughs )
That's not funny.
But it is... it is a
little funny, though.
Isn't it, Bill?
The big, bad wolf slain by the
little damsel in distress.
( groans )
A whole, new kind of fairy tale.
I feel like I'm gonna puke.
They're gonna find you.
I'm gonna tell the cops.
I'm gonna tell them.
I'm gonna tell them that
Sheryl did this.
You know, baby, that would work,
if Sheryl was my name.
( groans )
It doesn't have to be like this.
You can give up now, and you won't...
be in trouble.
See ya, Bill.
Sheryl, don't do this.
Sheryl?
Oh, man!
( eerie music playing )
( electricity buzzing )
( door opens )
( electricity shutting down )
Sheryl?
Is that you?
( flesh tearing )
( Bill crying out )
( Bill screams )
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
( telephone line ringing )
Mother ( on phone ): Hello?
Hi, mom.
- Natalie! How are you, baby?
Yeah, I'm good, um, we're
just stopping off at
the badlands for lunch at
this little diner.
It's going all right.
How are you?
I'm okay, baby, just surviving.
Well, what did the doctors tell you?
The doctor said there's a good chance
the surgery will help, 
but it's very expensive.
They need me to pay for it now
because of my bankruptcy.
It's okay, I'm strong...
And we've always been a strong family,
just the two of us.
Well, you just stay strong, okay?
I will, honey.
You do exactly what they say.
I am.
Hey, um, I have some money.
I'll bring it.
Enough to cover the operation.
No, Natalie, you don't have to.
I know that you don't want it,
but you need it.
Oh, bless your heart, baby.
Thank you.
Of course, anything for you.
Hey, well, I gotta go, so...
I'll be there, I promise.
Okay, sweetie. I love you.
I love you, too.

Male Reporter ( on TV ):
Breaking news today, we have
new developments in this ongoing story.
The ex-minister and convicted felon
now known as "The Reaper"
has been sighted in Kings County,
the same city where he was convicted
for murder so many years ago.
The Reaper, after surviving
the electric chair
and escaping
the state penitentiary,
is believed to be hiding
in or around Kings County.
The nightmare continues.
Police are investigating a missing
persons case in the area:
Tammy Simmons, a known prostitute,
has gone missing
 and the police believe that
The Reaper might be involved.
Again, authorities are urging the people
of Kings County to stay indoors
and be cautious
until the police are able
to apprehend the suspect.
In other news--
I'm all right.
Hi. What'll it be, sweetie?
Um, give me a piece
of that chocolate cake.
I'll get that warmed up for you.
Thank you.
There you go.
Thank you, darling.
- Can I get you anything else, Rob?
- No, darling.
Just go and look after
the other customers
like you're paid to.
- M'kay.
Red meat'll kill ya.
Something's got you, my son?
I got Daisy Mae here
to watch my back.
I'm telling you, man,
go vegetarian.
Better for the body
and the soul.
Yeah,  but I ain't got one
and neither have you.
Better for the body, at least.
Now, here's a down payment.
That's for somebody else's soul.
Whoa, hey!
Oh, now I think you owe me...
for all them other jobs you
keep screwing up.
Now what do you say?
Hey, hey, hey!
One finger for a down payment?
Hey, man, I'm an earner.
 I make money for you.
Don't you forget that.
Good point.
And that's why you're above ground.
Now, show me the stuff.
Blue pill... blue pill.
That don't taste like I'm screwing up,
now does it,  Rob?
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
That is nuclear.
That's right.
Now get me the rest.
This is... this is
not enough to close the deal.
Listen... you make the deal,
or I'll make you squeal.
That how you sweet talk
ol' Daisy Mae?
Just remember, Daisy Mae has
got a soft spot for you.
Don't let her down.
Fellas... .
( exhales )
Rough day, cowboy?
Well, I'll tell you
something, darling,
bull riding would have been
a lot easier than this.
Come here,
I got a little something to show you.
Between us, okay?
Rob is not gonna like this.
Oh, ho, ho, he doesn't
have to know, darling.
[Waitress] I'm not for sale.
Everybody is, sweetheart.
Everybody.
How do you like your coffee?
Hot, sweet, and sometimes
with a shot of amaretto.
So, when are you going to
take me on that long-overdue ride?
Excuse me, can I pay for
that chocolate cake?
Waitress: Yeah, sure.
Here you go.
You can keep the change.
Thank you.
What were we talking about again?
Darling?
What the... hell?
Oh, perfect!
Freaking perfect.
( car engine starting )
Whoa! Oh!
Oh, my God, are you okay?
You freaking worthless...
I mean, yeah, you okay?
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
I mean...
my heart is racing, but...
I don't know what happened,
my foot must have just slipped.
Yeah, that happens sometimes.
Yeah.
Well, that sucks about your car.
Either pure bad luck, or
 I must have really
pissed somebody off.
Huh...
Do you want a ride?
I mean,
I did almost
just kind of kill you.
That you did.
Unfortunately, I don't
take rides from strangers.
Okay.
I'm Sarah.
Brad.
I guess this means we're not
strangers anymore, now does it?
Hop in, Brad.
( car door opens, closes )
( engine starts )
So, where you headed?
Your guess is as good as mine.
No, really?
Well, I was heading
to a meeting.
It's actually
not too far from here.
Hmm.
So, what were you
doing at Rob's diner?
( scoffs )
I was on a date.
And how did that go?
It didn't.
He stood me up.
Well, he is an idiot.
You're sweet.
Just being nice to my driver.
This way I don't have to
give you much of a tip.
Huh.  And a gentleman, too.
So, um...
what is it that you do?
I buy and sell stuff.
What kind of stuff?
The profitable kind.
Hey, would you pull over
at that mini mart over there?
And make a right here.
Well, thank you.
Of course.
You know, um...
( exhales )
My mom used to say that
with every sunset
comes a new beginning.
So that's what you're looking for.
Isn't that what we're
all looking for?
If, ha, if I was to kiss you...
- Mm-hm?
It would not be in a
mini mart parking lot.
Sarah, we just met.
I don't know what kind
of girl you think I am.
Well hopefully,
no kind of girl at all.
But if we were...
If we were...
Going to kiss...
- Mm-hm...
At a different location.
Yeah, umm...
Is there anything
that you might want?
Uhh, something fermented.
And lots of it.
( engine starts )
Sorry, honey. But it's
all about the money.
( tires squeal )
( engine sputtering )
No, no, no!
Oh, come on, come on...
Oh, oh. Oh, my... really?
Really.
Oh...
great.
Perfect... perfect!
( dramatic music playing )
( coyote howling )
Hey.
Jack:  Looks like you got trouble.
Yeah, that's the,
uh, horoscope of the day.
Is that your car?
Yeah, it's stolen. I'm not, um...
ex-boyfriend.
Jerk, you know?
Yeah, I've seen it on the road,
he's a real piece of work.
Yeah.
So, uh,
do you think you could fix it?
You know what, sweetheart?
I just drive them,
I don't work on them.
- Oh, yeah.
Where you headed?
West. Away from him.
West.  Okay, you know
you're headed east?
Ha, well, um, I do now.
Look, you're not gonna get a
tow out here 'til tomorrow.
You want a lift?
Naw, it's-it's all right.
Thanks, though.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Have it your way.
You know what, you
know, um, actually...
yeah,  I'll... I'll take you up
on that ride.
- Jump in.
- Thanks.

Woman Reporter ( on radio ):
The nightmare continues to unfold.
The prison warden
and county's top prosecutor
were found terribly mutilated
in separate but possibly
related incidents.
Some speculate the serial killings are
somehow linked...
Natalie:  Can you turn that off?
To the execution of the original --
Hey, by the way, my name's Jack.
How far out west you going?
California.
You got people out there
or you just ah,
trying to get away from that prick?
Listen, I really appreciate
the ride and everything,
but I've had a long day and I would
really like to get some rest.
Sure, all right. I'll--
I'll just drive.
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.
No, hey, look,
I've had shit days myself.
So, Jack, how long you
been on the road?
Mmm...  about five minutes
past forever.
Well, that sounds lonely.
Eh, not really.
 And I don't play
well with other people.
But I'd do anything
to be your age.
What would you do differently?
Absolutely everything.
Whoa, watch this.
Oh. I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Look, I gotta make one stop.
And there's a hotel there.
No.
No hotels.
It's not like that.
I gotta get some sleep.
And you look like you
could take a break, too.
Look, I just, i... I
really need to keep going.
Look, I gotta make this stop.
So, if you don't like the deal,
just say so and I'll keep driving.
You would do that?
Well, yeah.
I can get some sleep
when I die.

Whoa, uh, ha-ha, is it cool
if I just stay in the car?
Haven't you listened
to the radio?
All the bodies
they're finding on this stretch?
You're a lot safer in there
with me,
than you are
out here without me.
What's the worst
that could happen?
Uhhh.
Don't you look
familiar, young lady?
The, um...
( clears throat )
the car's looking pretty
good right about now, Jack.
I'm sorry, folks, the honeymoon suite
is already booked for the evening.
We're gonna need two rooms, amigo.
Uh, connected if you got 'em.

Announcer ( on radio ):  Anyone with
any information on the murderer
police have labeled The Reaper,
please call 1-555-587-6238.
You heard?
About The Reaper?
How could we not hear?
You got those keys?
They say he's on a rampage, seeking
revenge against the unjust.
You actually believe that crap?
It doesn't matter, because
I'm not a sinner.
Hey. You're scaring her,
and you're scaring me.
Now why don't you
get us those keys?
Boy's a real piece of work.
Um, I can pay for my own...
- I got it, I got it.  Don't worry.
Rooms eight and nine...
and don't forget to pray.
Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners.
Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by Thy name.
That one's yours.
( exhalation )
Oh, um, hey,
thanks again for everything.
You know,
I never did get your name.

Look, it's been a long day.
The imagination has a--
- Look, he was watching me.
All right, hold on.
Come on, hurry!
Why do you have that?
Why do you have that?
( dramatic music playing )
Look, I know
that I saw somebody.
All right.
Well, whatever it was,
it's not here now.
Oh, my God, you must
be so sick of me.
Naw, I'm not
bored with you yet, kid.
Why don't we go get a drink
and calm our nerves.
So, I thought you were supposed
to be meeting somebody.
Yeah, that's later.
Oh, yeah?
Thanks for helping me back there.
So, this guy you're running
from, he get outta line?
They all do, eventually.
You married?
No.
Ehh. Thought you were too young.
I was, once.
Oh, yeah? Handsome guy like you
got locked down? How'd she do it?
I don't know. Got me
to stop drinking.
I started drinking
when I was about 12.
Met her 15 years later
and I just quit.
Well, how'd she do it?
God, I have no idea.
It didn't last anyways.
I think I still
kinda missed the booze and...
started getting out of line.
What was her name?
Millie... Mildred.
Well, when did she leave you?
It was a car accident.
 I lived.
- Kids?
- Yeah, I got one.
She lives with her aunt in Florida,
her mom's sister.
She won't talk to me.
So, if you don't have an ex, why
are you going to California?
My mom. She's, um she's not in
the best condition right now.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What about your dad?
Dad? Yeah, he, uh, he wasn't
really good for much...
except for running
around on my mom and me.
And then one day...
he just left.
Then my mom had to go
and get sick on me.
You know, not tell me until a
couple of weeks ago how bad it is.
Well, looks like both of us
could use a refill.
Yeah...
You know, maybe...
Maybe I should go.
You got me thinking.
Thinking is good...
Only in moderation.
I'll walk you out.
If you need anything,
come on over.
I'll leave my door unlocked.
You know, you, um, really
shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
You're not that bad of a guy.
What do you know? You just met me.
You're just a kid.
Yeah, I'm young,
but I've met enough to know.
Get some rest.
You, too.

Jack: You can't be serious.
What the hell is he watching?
Jack:  What do you mean
you lost it?
Brad:  I didn't lose it, all right?
It was stolen, man.
Jack:  Okay, stolen, lost, misplaced.
Doesn't matter.
No money, no pills.
Calm down, all right,
just calm down, old man.
I'm gonna get you your money.
Just give me some time
to figure things out, all right?
You got 'til dawn, and
then I'm out of here.
Well, mighty kind of you.
Mighty kind of you.
Lemme see,
smart guy like you,
there are only two ways
you could be taken.
One would be a woman.
The other would be a woman.
Which one was it?
Looked like an angel.
I hope that angel is watching
out for you... tonight.
( door closes )
Toss me a taste, will you?
Just toss me a taste.
What do you think this
is, a charity line?
Give me a break, man,
I need to stay wired, come on!
All right here,
knock yourself out.
Oh, I hope you
brought more than these.
( chuckling )  Yeah, sure,  here,
 let me tell you
where my stash is...
so you can come back later tonight
and try to Jack me.

Hello?
Did ya miss me, missy?
Jesus!
Well, haven't you been
a naughty girl tonight?
And still looking for more.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
When you came here, I sensed
you would be my sister.
That you would come to know me.
Mm, well, I just came here for a cab.
That's all.
Can ya...   call one?
( dials phone )
Taxi for one.
Last Chance... Hotel.
( hangs up phone )
Thirty minutes or less.
If you need anything.
Anything at all... .
I'm good.
Thank you.
( eerie music fades up )
Yeah, yeah, that's the good news, but the
bad news is he's trying to screw us.
Mm-hm, double.
Double!   Well, hell no,
I didn't pay him that.
I mean, I only got half
what he's asking for.

Boys...
I was right.
Brad is a punk.
Now I want you
to go to his hotel...
...and finish things.
One more thing.
When you get the stuff...
get a big green apple...
 and put it in his mouth...
like one of them
stuffed pigs.
Now do it.
Hh-ha.
Jackpot.
Sorry, Jack.
Damn it!
Damn.
What?
( floor creaking )
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
( dramatic music fades up )
Hey, stranger, remember me?
( electricity buzzing )
Oh!    -Uh!
Oh!
What the hell's going on?
Natalie?
Oh, it's Natalie now, not Sarah?
Both of you shut up!
All right, calm down, honey.
Oh, your honey over here is
a conniving little thief.
What's he talking about?
Well, go on, Natalie, go on,
or whatever your name is.
Shut up, or I'll put
a bullet in both of you.
See, Natalie over here is the woman
that I was telling you about.
And I'm willing to bet she has a
 whole lot more than just my money by now.
You so much as breathe,
and I'll shoot.
Ooh, we got a tough girl.
You think we can
take her, Jack?
Hey!
- Natalie:  Yeah. ( laughs )
Next time, I aim higher.
( eerie music playing )
( tape ripping )
You know,
I told myself that I was
going to turn over a new leaf.
But guys like you
make me feel so good about being bad.
( electricity crackling )
( loud banging )
Huh.  Ha, That's my ride!
( opens squeaky door )
Aw, no show?
What, baby, did you want me
to stick around and play?
Natalie, we can work this out.
There is nothing
to work out.
You two are
a bunch of low-life criminals.
Unbelievable, the thief is preaching.
Hey, what's in your purse, huh?
What's in it?
( car approaching )
That's my ride.
You boys have a good night.
You don't know
what's coming for ya.
Mmm.
Mmph!
Finally got what you wanted,
huh, baby?
You're making a big mistake.
You know what, no, no,
because you already have made
a lifetime of them.
( door squeaks, then closes )
I'll get you out, hang on,
I'll get you out.
Brad:  Rob is sending the bag man.
He don't care who he gotta kill.
( guns cocking )
( dramatic music playing )
( switch clicks )
( banging )
( banging continues )
( plastic bag crinkles )
( banging continues )
( buzzes )
( electricity buzzes )
What the hell?
That's our guy.
Shoot his ass!
( gunshots )
( gunshots continue )
Where'd he go?
You don't know
who you're messing with.
( running steps )
( dramatic music playing )
( gun cocks )
( groans )
( door slams closed )
What the hell, man?
Joe.
Operator ( on phone ):   9-1-1, what
is the nature of your emergency?
Um, the, the nature of the problem
is an emergency in the Last Chance Hotel.
I got a green apple for you, pig!
( electricity buzzing )
( gunshot )
( muffled screaming )
Natalie:  Know... the address?
( screaming continues )
The address... is, um...
( Natalie shrieking )
I tried to be righteous, sister.
But no, no, you had to
bring out the filth in me.
Now you're like gonna
like our sin before you die.
No!
( struggling )
Should I tell them
about your friend in room seven?
( muffled yelling )
Or are you ready for your
punishment from your brother?
Hail Mary...
Yes! There's a...
Kiss me first,
kiss me first, please!
Ow! Ooo!
( chuckles )
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha, yeah!
Yeah. Yeah.
You're a harlot,
you're not a killer.
Yeah?
( gun clicks, jams )
You're a har...
That's divine intervention.
No! No! No!
I never called the taxi.
Forbidden fruit, I am going to make you
repent before he comes for you.
( electricity buzzing )
( church bell begins tolling )
I made a mistake, Reaper!
I was getting her ready for you!
No, Reaper, please!
Mercy! Mercy!
No!
It's here.
Who's here?
The Reaper!
Boy, you really have lost it,
haven't you?
There were
dead bodies everywhere!
( muffled speech )
Get the gag
out of his mouth.
Who's dead?
We are.
( banging on door )
Be careful!
( door opens, squeaks, then closes )
( broken glass crunching )
( door closing )
What's in the bag?
What's in the bag?
That's that religious nut's hat.
The desk clerk downstairs.
Natalie, what exactly
did you see out there?
I don't know, I mean,
first he was there and
then he wasn't.
Get us out of this damn tape!
- No!
Listen! You're gonna need
all the help you can get!
Get that machete, cut me loose.
I'm trying.
( tape tearing )
- No!
- Think you could just walk away?  Huh?
Where is my money?
Where is it?
Huh?
Let her go.
She left us for dead, man.
Get off her or I'll cut your head off.
( loud bang )
( cocks gun )
Drop your weapon!
Drop it!
Ah, stay back! Stay back,
pretty boy, stay back!
Blondie, you all right?
Huh, um, yeah.
All right. Now let's figure
out what's going on.
( police radio chatter)
Wake up, boy.
( sighs )
Now how does a sweet, innocent
little thing like you,
find yourself in a heap
of crap like this?
Don't be fooled, officer,
she's as rotten as they come.
I don't remember asking
you a damn thing!
What you staring at?
Officer of the law.
That's right.
Let's see what you got here.
Well, well, well...
narcotics.
You boys are screwed!
Let me tell you
something, darling.
You are one fine piece of pie.
Officer?
I don't think that you understand
that there's a psycho killer on the loose.
( she chuckles, he laughs )
Well, then let's get our
asses out of here.
All right,
let's go, boys.
( dramatic music fades up )
( police radio chatter )
Careful, officer, she bites.
One more word and you'll be
spitting out those shiny teeth.
( loud bang )
We need to leave.
Ain't nothing, get you back.
Move!
Move!
Now you three stay in here.
I'm gonna go check that out.
( door creaks, closes )
( police radio chatter )
( eerie music playing )
( telephone rings )
( gunshot )
There's gotta be a way out of here.
That's it right there.
( police radio chatter )
( forced breathing )
Well, Daisy Mae, I suppose if
you want a job done properly,
you have to do it yourself.
( dramatic music fades up )
What the hell?
( electricity crackling )
( gun shot )
( shell ejects, clangs )
Run! Run, boy, you can't hide!
The big bad sheriff's up for
a killin' party tonight!
( music continues )
( faint whispering )
( whistles )
( whistles again)
Natalie, get us out of these cuffs.
You need us and you know it.
No, the last time,
you almost killed me.
Look around you.
If we stay here tonight,
it's over for all of us.
Jack:  He's right, Natalie.
Tonight is not our night.
( electricity crackles )
( Gregorian chant playing )
Brad:  That's right,
I knew you had it in you.
Natalie:  Oh, shut up, would you?
Come on!
( keys jingling )
Oh, damn!
Brad:  It was right there.
- I don't see it.
- It was right there beneath you.
I can't see it. I
can't see anything!
Hey!  It's time
to get out of here.
( loud bang )
( electricity crackling )
( gun fires )
What was that?
( loud thud )
My God, where is it?
They were right there,  come on!
What is...
what...
Natale:  Ugh!
Brad:  Looks like officer what's-his-face
isn't coming back to get us.
Jack:  Come on. Come on.
Natalie:  I found it. I found it!
Get these. Hurry up. Come on!
He's coming.
Okay... All right.
( door opens )
Watch out, watch out.
Oh, man,
( dramatic music fades up )
( lock clicks ) You think that
lock is gonna do us any good?
That thing outside is real.
It's the thing from the news.
And we're next, unless--
Unless what? Huh? So suddenly we're
all best friends all of a sudden?
No offense, but you're
not exactly lifeline material.
And let's just say this is the
last time you and I do business.
Okay? So, good luck to the two of you...
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Walk out that door
and you're a dead man.
Only way out of
here is together.
Listen, guys, if we... if we can
just make it through the night...
Then your money and your pills will
both be back in your guys' hands.
So we're gonna risk getting killed
in exchange for what's already ours?
Or we can die right now.
We just gotta make
it to that truck.
Just give me the keys,
I'll go get her.
No. You stay with her.
Get what you owe me.
I'll get the truck.
Guys, um... about the truck?
It's kind of, uh, broken.
Oh.
I didn't want you guys
following me!
But this was before...
Any of this.
Oh, bitch just keeps
getting better and better.
Is there anything
that you can't ruin?
Listen, Jack, if you just put the
wires back in the distributor cap...
She'll run like a charm.
You two, hold up your end.
I'll pick you up out front.
Wait, wait, um...
About what I said earlier?
I'm really sorry.
It's me who's messing
everything up.
Nah, you're gonna be all right.
Just got to be a little smarter.
Stay safe.
( ominous music playing )
Oh...
Aww, getting all lovey dovey.
Now they taught you well at
whore school, didn't they?
You sure as hell can fake it when
you need to make it, can't ya?
It's not all fake.
But you wouldn't know the
difference, would you?
You expect me to buy that?
Do you?
Look at this face.
Would I lie?
( electricity crackles )
Holy...
( dramatic music playing )
( music changes )
- Where is it?    - I don't know.
- Where'd you put it?
I don't know,
listen, it was right there.
Where is it now?
Look, just stay here, you look;
I'm gonna go upstairs
and check it out.
I don't think so.
Trust me.
( dramatic music playing )
( electricity buzzes )
( metallic groan )
Looking for this, Brad?
Why do you look so surprised?
All your stuff's there, man.
You're home free.
But you never stuck
to your part of the deal.
( spins and cocks the revolver )
Now, on your knees.
Is that all you got?
Huh, Rob?
- No, no, no!
It looks like
a little bit more poetic for you.
Go on,  do it.
I want you to.
( thuds )
( stab and flesh tearing )
Looks like Daisy Mae's
still into you, old pal.
Now...
she's mine now.
( stabs again )
( Rob cries out )
( truck engine starts )
Mm, so are we square?
( vehicle horn honks repeatedly )
Almost.
( truck approaching )
- Get in!
- Where's the lunatic?
I don't know, get in!
- There's just one problem, Jack.
- What?
( gunshot )
- Why?  - Get out, now!
-Why?
You...
 I should shoot.
But you did save my life back there.
So now we're square.
What?
You can't just leave me here.
Oh, I can, and I will.
See, our little love story is
just way too dangerous, sweetheart.
I think you're
better suited for the road.
But we were on
to a new beginning.
New beginning?
There are no new beginnings
for people like us.
Haven't you figured that out already?
I'm afraid there's no fairytale
ending for you, sweetheart.
( electricity buzzing )
Oh!
( dramatic music playing )
( church bell begins tolling )
( bell continues tolling )
( bell continues tolling )
( tolling ends )
( electricity buzzing )
( dramatic music playing )
( footsteps and electricity crackling )
( dramatic music continues )
Rise.
Behold your fate, sinner.
( struggles )
Why didn't you kill me before?
Salvation was within your reach.
What are you doing?
Sending you to hell
where you belong.
You had your chance to change...
...but you failed.
Agh!
( panting )
You're just like the rest of them,
corrupt and wicked.
( muffled screaming )
Agh! Agh!
Jack! Get the keys in
my front pocket!
It's in the front pocket.
Unlock the cuffs.
Thank you.
( groans )
Natalie:   Oh, my God...
It's going to be okay!
It already is.
You're gonna walk away.
I'm so sorry!
Don't be.
You got time.
- What?
- Take... take the truck...
to start again.
( Natalie softly weeping )
( soft music playing )
( telephone rings )
( answering machine beeps )
Natalie ( to machine ): Hey Mom, I'm
sorry I keep missing you.
On the way back to you now.
The car's all fixed.
I met this really nice man, Jack,
on the road last night.
I guess not all strangers
are the bad kind.
Okay, well, I love you
and I'll see you soon.
( key turns )
( engine starts )
( wind blowing )
Where are you headed?
Anywhere but here.
Hop in.
Are you okay?
What happened to you?
You should see the other guys.
Thanks.  I really appreciate it.
Ooh, I can't even begin to tell you
about how many weirdoes
I've met on the road.
Huh, I can imagine.
I didn't know a chick could
drive a bad boy like this.
It used to belong to
a friend of mine.
An ex?
Yeah. Something like that.
So... what's your story?
How much time you got?
