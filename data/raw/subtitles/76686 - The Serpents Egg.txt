The scene is Berlin,
the evening of Saturday,
November 3, 1923.
A pack of cigarettes
costs four billion marks,
and most everyone has lost faith
in both the future and the present.
Mr. Abel?
Your brother´s already at home.
This is for both of you.
Thank you, Frau Hemse.
Thank you.
You can sit down.
So, you don´t speak German at all?
Damned nuisance.
Fräulein Dorst
has her Sunday ruined.
- What´s your name?
- Abel Rosenberg.
l´m 35.
l was born in Philadelphia.
My folk come from Riga in Latvia.
My brother Max
and his wife Manuela,
the three of us
came to Berlin a month ago...
No, at the end of September.
Max hurt his wrist,
so we couldn´t perform anymore.
We were circus artists.
We had a trapeze act.
The reason
of your brother´s suicide?
Depression?
Unhappy love affair?
Alcoholism? Drugs?
Nervous breakdown?
- Fed up with life generally?
- l don´t know.
An unexplainable impulse,
was that it?
Well, it happens.
Did you get in touch with his wife?
l tried to last night
and this morning, but l can´t find her.
You didn´t live together,
all of you?
Max and Manuela
got divorced two years ago.
After the circus let us go,
Manuela went to work
in a cabaret.
l will go see her there
this afternoon.
They open at 3:00 on Sundays.
May l see your papers, please?
Yes.
You´re Jewish?
- Why?
- Nothing.
l was just curious.
You may now go.
Thank you.
What are your plans?
How long will you stay in Berlin?
As you know, there is
great unemployment.
We are not going to take care
of you when your money runs out.
Yes, l know.
Good-bye, Mr. Rosenberg.
Good-bye, lnspector.
Good-bye, Fräulein Dorst.
Abel!
Are you going to have lunch?
So am l. lt´s on me. Come.
How are things, my dear Abel?
And how are Max and Manuela?
Do you think his wrist
will be better soon?
We all miss you, you know.
The circus needs you.
You´re wondering what l´m doing in Berlin
when the circus is in Amsterdam.
l´m looking for new acts, my boy.
Come in, come in.
Nowadays l could get
any damned star l want.
They all know l pay in dollars.
We´re playing
to full houses all the time.
l could have twice as big a tent,
and it would still be full.
Look what l read
in the paper this morning.
l´ll try to translate it.
Listen to this.
´´Terrible times are at hand
´´when circumcised
anti-Christian Asiatics on all sides
´´are lifting their
gory hands to strangle us.
´´The massacre of Christians
´´by the Jew lsaskar Zederblum,
alias Mr. Lenin,
´´was enough to make
a Genghis Kahn blush.
´´A Jewish terrorist pack,
trained to murder and assault,
´´is prowling through the country,
´´butchering honest citizens
and farmers on portable gallows.
´´Will you wait until you see
thousands of people
´´hanging from lampposts
in your town?
´´Do you want to wait
until a Bolshevik commission
´´starts its murderous work
in your town, just as in Russia?
´´Do you want to stumble over
the bodies of your women and children?
Existence today
is nothing but dread.´´
Do you need money?
l can lend you some.
Look.
Here are some billions.
Take them. l don´t need them.
Why don´t you say something, Abel?
l don´t believe
in all this political crap.
The Jews are
as stupid as everybody.
lf a Jew gets into trouble,
it´s his own fault.
He gets into trouble
because he acts stupid.
l´m not gonna act stupid,
so l´m not gonna get into trouble.
Now you know, Papa Hollinger.
Thanks for the soup...
and the money.
l have to meet Manuela at 4:00.
Take care.
Hello, Abel.
What´s wrong?
When l got home last night,
Max had blown his brains out.
l knew he´d do that.
l...tried to keep an eye on him...
but l didn´t really think he would...
He had a...sort of joke
these last few weeks.
Do you know what that was?
l would ask him sometimes.
He just said the money was good,
and he told me
to mind my own business.
There´s a letter for you.
His handwriting
is impossible to read.
l can´t. Can you?
l can´t make out...
Wait.
Something...
´´There´s...
poisoning going on.´´
´´There´s poisoning going on´´?
l didn´t see
much of him these weeks.
You lived in the same room.
We had a fight...
...a fistfight...
...over a whore.
l didn´t hit him hard.
l was worried about his bad wrist.
Christ, finale!
l´m not ready. Please help me.
- l didn´t know you performed.
- Neither did l.
One of the girls got influenza and l said,
´´Why can´t l take her number?´´
Take care of Max´s money.
There´s nowhere to hide it here.
lt´s funny seeing everything
from the side like this.
l seem to recognize you.
Did we smoke
our first cigarette together?
No?
But if l say Amalfi,
a summer day 26 years ago...
Our parents had cottages
next door to each other.
You had an older sister called...
let me see...
Rebecca. Right?
Do you mind letting me by?
l´m in a hurry.
Why, of course...Abel Rosenberg.
So...get off the chair
and get your wet jacket off.
And l´ll make you some real tea,
nice and hot.
That´ll do you good.
lt´s only the man
that changes the toilet cans.
He comes every
Monday morning around 4:00.
Oh, God.
We used to spend
the summers in Amalfi.
And Mama had trouble
with her lungs.
Max and l used to play
with a boy named Hans Vergerus.
His folks came from Düsseldorf.
The father was
some kind of big shot,
a Supreme Court Justice
or something.
Mama didn´t like Hans.
l guess no one did.
But everyone thought
he was some kind of genius.
Once...
...we caught a cat and tied it down.
Hans cut it open.
lt was still alive.
He let me see
how its heart beat.
Fast, fast...
l ran across him again
ten years ago in Heidelberg...
...when we were there
with the circus.
Yes, l remember that.
l saw him again today.
Hans?
Did you see him?
He was at the cabaret.
No.
Manuela?
lt´s morning.
The advantage
of knowing influential people
is that you can have
real coffee for breakfast.
The fire is going nicely,
but it will take a while
before it gets really hot.
Do you get firewood the same way?
l do know a woodkeeper,
as a matter of fact.
But l don´t know anyone
who can get me butter,
so you´ll have to eat marmalade.
lt´s made of chemicals,
the label says.
l owe you a dollar.
l have to keep track.
Never mind.
Well, you...
You should keep this money
before l spend it all on booze.
- Do you drink so much?
- Whenever l have the money.
You´re not going back
to the circus?
What good is it without Max?
Well, we´ll get
a new partner, of course.
- You know that´s impossible.
- l know nothing of the kind.
We´ll make a new number
together, just you and l.
Abel, we could make
a magical act.
l know a marvelous magician.
Markus, you know, he´s just retired.
We could take over his show.
l don´t know.
Since this business
with Max, l´m just...
Ever since l met Max,
you´ve been my big brother.
We´re going to stick together now.
l wake up from a nightmare
and find that real life
is worse than the dream.
Abel, everything is all right.
We have everything we need.
l just can´t figure it out.
Last night they were beating a man.
The police just turned their backs.
Abel, listen to me now.
You´re awfully tired.
You´ve been drinking
much too much lately.
l´m going to look after you now.
ln a few days everything
will be much better. You´ll see.
We´ll talk things over.
But now l must hurry.
l have to go to work.
Work?
Yeah, l have two jobs.
- This time of the morning?
- Yeah, this time of the morning.
- l can´t be late.
- What sort of job?
Well, l don´t know exactly.
lt´s secret anyway.
- Secret?
- No, l was joking.
- lt´s an office. l stick stamps...
- What kind of office?
lt´s import and export.
l´m not really sure.
What´s the name of the company?
What the hell
is the name of the company?
Ferkel. Ferkel und Sohn.
Where is this office?
ln Bayerstrasse.
Stop nagging me.
You sound like a jealous husband.
l´ll be home around 2:00
and we´ll have dinner together.
Try and get hold of some meat
while we still have the money.
- Twenty-two bucks.
- We´re rich.
- Herr Rosenberg?
- Yes?
Would you mind
coming in here for a moment?
My name is Frau Holle.
l am Manuela´s landlady.
Manuela just had time
to tell me about you on her way out.
You are welcome to stay here
with me for a short time.
These sudden changes in weather
make my back ache,
so l must stay in bed all the day.
Still, it´s nice with a peep
of sun in November,
isn´t it, Herr Rosenberg?
Would you care
for a glass of sherry?
l am very attached to Manuela.
lf you forgive my saying so,
l am as fond of her
as if she were my own daughter.
Prosit, Herr Rosenberg.
She is so kind and naive.
lt´s as if all the terrible things going on
around us didn´t concern her.
l think your sister-in-law is heading
for trouble, Herr Rosenberg.
The odd thing about Manuela
is that she doesn´t defend herself.
Nothing must happen to her.
Take this new job now.
There´s something odd about it.
The Society for Church Democracy--
what is that, Herr Rosenberg?
lt isn´t even in the phone book.
l must go now, Frau Holle.
How much is the rent?
Should l pay in advance?
lt doesn´t matter.
But if you have money,
l don´t mind.
You have dollars, haven´t you?
Shall we say $3 a month?
Or is that too much?
No, of course not.
Have you been crying?
No. Why?
lt just seemed so.
Forgive me, Herr Rosenberg.
Good-bye, Frau Holle.
Good-bye, Herr Rosenberg.
We have been waiting for you.
May l ask you
where you´ve been all night?
l couldn´t very well
sleep in that room.
- Where have you been?
- With my sister-in-law.
She lives at 35 Bergmannstrasse,
doesn´t she?
- Yes, l think so.
- Think?
- l think it´s number 35.
- Well, now you know.
- May l pack some things?
- Not yet, Rosenberg.
l must ask you to come with us
to the morgue to identify someone.
- l have to?
- l´m afraid l must insist.
Well, then, we´d better get going.
l´d advise you to smoke
down there. lt helps.
- Do you recognize that girl?
- Yes.
- Who is she?
- Greta Hofer.
- How do you happen to know her?
- She was engaged to my brother.
- When did you see her last?
- A week ago.
- Was your brother on good terms...
- Yes, l think so.
Fräulein Hofer´s been assaulted.
Cause of death...drowning.
Do you recognize this man?
No.
- Are you quite sure?
- No.
Think hard, Rosenberg.
lt´s important.
- He´s like someone.
- Who?
He´s like my father.
- You can do better than that.
- That´s all.
He´s like my father.
My father died five years ago.
Someone stuck a very thin hypodermic
needle into this man´s heart.
A liquid of some sort was injected
into the left ventricle,
a poison that must have caused him
hideous pain before he died,
which probably took several hours.
So you haven´t seen
this man before?
Have you seen this woman before?
Yes.
Who is she?
l don´t know.
- But l´ve seen her.
- Where?
l think she delivered papers.
l used to meet her
at Frau Hemse´s boardinghouse.
Once, she helped me up the stairs
when l was too drunk
to make it on my own.
- Her name is Maria Stern.
- l didn´t know her name.
She hanged herself
in the basement room
where she lived with her
husband and two children.
But she left a very strange letter.
Totally muddled.
She said she had been
frightened to death
and that the pain was unbearable.
l don´t think l can take this.
Come along.
Come on!
Have you ever seen this boy?
No.
He worked at the cabaret.
You never saw him there?
No.
He used to stand near the entrance
working the spotlight.
You must have seen him.
Yes, it´s possible.
We are not certain
how he was killed.
He seems to have been
run over by a truck,
but something tells us he´d been
assaulted or tortured first.
Why do you want me
to see all this?
During the last month, seven
mysterious deaths have occurred...
in your vicinity, Herr Rosenberg.
You don´t suspect me?
l think we need a cup of coffee.
This can´t be called coffee,
but it´s something.
Not very chatty,
are you, Rosenberg?
Can you account
for the movements
on the evening
of Sunday, October 28th?
- You can´t?
- l was drunk.
Ask me about October 19th.
l was drunk then, too.
l´ve been drunk every night
since l left the circus.
Something doesn´t add up.
No?
lf you were so well known--
good income, good reputation--
why did you start drinking?
l´m an alcoholic.
Famous trapeze artist...
alcoholic?
Maybe l didn´t feel welcome
in your beautiful city.
Why do l have to stay here?
You may be able to help me
with seven unsolved deaths.
Tomorrow everything´s
gonna disappear.
Why bother with a few murders?
l´ll tell you, Rosenberg.
l bother for my own sake.
l know that the catastrophe
could be here in a few hours.
They say the rate of exchange
for the dollar is five billion marks.
The French have occupied the Ruhr.
We have just paid a billion
in gold to the British.
On every damned job
there are Bolshevik agitators.
ln Munich, a Herr Hitler
is preparing a putsch
with thousands of starving soldiers
and madmen in uniform.
We have a government that
doesn´t know which way to turn.
Everyone´s afraid.
So am l.
l can´t sleep for fear.
Nothing works properly except fear.
On Friday l wanted to go to Stettin
to see my old mother.
She´ll be 80. But there was
no timetable anymore.
There was a train that might go,
but no timetable, Rosenberg.
lmagine!
A Germany without timetables!
So what does lnspector Bauer do?
lnspector Bauer does his job.
He tries to create a little
patch of order and reason
in the midst of chaos.
And he´s not alone, Rosenberg.
All over Germany,
millions and millions
of petty officials,
just as terrified,
are doing exactly the same.
You get drunk every day, huh?
That´s also respectable, Rosenberg.
But l´d be happier if you swung
on your trapeze with your pals.
That way you´d fight
your fear more effectively.
So now you know why l sit here
investigating something
l think is extremely odd,
not to say horrible.
And now l must ask you
to keep quiet for a few minutes
while l write a few lines
to lnspector Lohmann,
who is working on another case
that also seems insane.
Sit down, Herr Rosenberg.
What do you suspect me of?
- Aren´t l entitled to a lawyer?
- This is a chat, not interrogation.
You´re taking it out on me.
l need a cigarette.
l know why you´re doing this.
lt´s because l´m a Jew.
l am here because l speak English.
You are allowed to smoke.
You have ten minutes.
l spoke with lnspector Bauer.
He was very kind
and understanding.
He wants to help you.
He said you went crazy.
What´s wrong, Manuela?
l´m just worried.
My savings are stolen.
l suppose you don´t know
where they´re gone.
l didn´t know
you had any savings.
They´re gone anyway.
Luckily l´m in charge
of Max´s money.
That´s just it.
lnspector Bauer told me
they found Max´s money on you
when they searched you.
He asked me if l knew where
Max had gotten hold of this money.
l said it was our savings,
as we were in Switzerland
with the circus
and several of the artists
changed their money into dollars
before they went
on tour to Germany.
Who do you think
stole your money?
What´d you say?
Yes?
You´re not listening.
You´re sick.
- What´s wrong?
- She´s sick.
l´m all right.
l haven´t eaten today.
l´d like to point out that you
have only a few minutes left.
- Manuela.
- Yes, Herr Rosenberg?
l am going to let you go,
Herr Rosenberg.
ln spite of the way you
attacked me and my colleagues.
My God, the way you swung at us.
But then, you are a circus artist.
What are you looking at?
l´m not looking, l´m wondering.
l´m wondering whether l ought
to tell you what l am wondering about.
But l think not.
Fräulein Dorst will show you where
you can collect your belongings.
We´ll keep your brother´s
dollar bills for the time being.
We´ll give you
a receipt, of course.
- What are you doing here?
- l dropped in to see Manuela.
l just heard
about your brother´s death.
You can go to hell.
What?!
You got any cigarettes?
There are some cigarettes
on the shelf.
Who is it?
- Come in a moment, Manuela.
- l´m awfully tired.
Could we talk tomorrow
when l come home for dinner?
l wish to speak to you now.
l can´t sleep because of the pain.
Besides, l am worried.
Has it something to do with me?
You wouldn´t have
asked that before, Manuela.
l´m dead tired.
l think l have a cold.
l want to go to bed.
lt´s about Herr Rosenberg.
l won´t have him
staying here in my house.
- But why?
- He seems unreliable and arrogant!
Besides, the authorities
don´t approve
of my letting unmarried couples
share a room.
l have changed my mind!
Herr Rosenberg
must move tomorrow!
But he´s paid his rent.
There´s the money.
l have changed it into marks.
lt´s illegal to have dollars.
You ought to know that.
lf Herr Rosenberg is leaving,
l´m leaving as well.
You must do as you like.
l think you´re rotten!
l think you are a witch!
We´ll get by. You´ll see.
As long as we stick together.
Have you slept
with Hans Vergerus?
Yes, l have.
- Often?
- Don´t be silly, Abel.
l want to know.
Three times, maybe four.
l don´t know.
- Does he pay you?
- No.
Yes...once.
- Why did he pay you only once?
- l don´t know.
- Why don´t you know?
- l felt sorry for him.
Are you in love with him?
- l don´t know.
- You don´t know?
l feel sorry for him...maybe me.
Maybe he needs some kindness.
Where did you go today?
l went to the office.
Then l came home
to have dinner with you.
ls it import and export
or something to do with the church
or neither? What?
l work at a whorehouse
in the morning.
lt´s not forbidden
as far as l know.
lt´s a very respectable whorehouse--
only for diplomats and managing
editors and famous actors.
lt´s so classy.
Be nice to me, Abel.
Please be nice to me, Abel.
Please be nice to me.
Tuesday, November 6th.
The newspapers are black
with fear, threats, and rumors.
The government seems powerless.
A bloody confrontation
between the extremist parties
appears unavoidable.
Despite all this,
people go to work,
the rain never stops,
and fear rises like vapor
from the cobblestones.
lt can be sensed
like a pungent smell.
Everyone bears it
like a nerve poison,
a slowly working poison,
felt only as
a quicker or slower pulse,
or as a spasm of nausea.
Abel, l´m too late.
l overslept.
l´ll be home at 2:00 for dinner.
l don´t know
why l´m bothering you.
My name is Manuela.
My father was a magician.
My mother was a circus rider.
l´ve been living
in circuses all my life.
My husband was
a circus artist as well.
Maybe it´s wrong of me
to trouble you,
but l need to talk
to somebody who understands.
This last week l´ve been going
to morning masses.
l´m confused.
And then someone told me
that you were an American.
lt´s very comforting.
My German isn´t very good.
My dear woman,
would you come to the point?
l have to get to another service.
l see.
Well, maybe you´ll come again.
All this guilt is too much for me.
l feel it´s my fault
that Max committed suicide.
You´re responsible for someone,
and then you fail your duties
and you stand there
empty-handed and ashamed,
wondering what you
could have been doing.
Now l feel l have to take care
of Max´s brother Abel as well,
- and that´s even worse.
- Worse?
Well, he´s just like Max.
He never says what he´s thinking.
He just charges ahead
with all his feeling
and he looks so frightened.
And l try to tell him
that we´ll help each other,
but that´s only words for him.
And everything l say is useless.
The only real thing is fear.
And l´m sick.
l don´t know what´s wrong.
ls there any forgiveness?
Would you like me
to pray for you?
- Do you think that would help?
- l don´t know.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
- ls it a special prayer?
- Yes, yes. Let me think.
We...We live
so far away from God...
...that he probably doesn´t hear us
when we pray for help.
So...
we must help each other,
give each other the forgiveness
that a remote God denies us.
l...say to you...
...that you are forgiven
for your husband´s death.
You´re no longer to blame.
And l beg your forgiveness...
...for my apathy...
...and my indifference.
Do you forgive me?
Yes, l forgive you.
That´s all we can do.
l must hurry.
The parish priest
becomes annoyed if l´m late.
Young woman,
l have to close up, please.
What the hell does this mean?
lt´s a place where
we´re going to live.
lt´s nice, isn´t it?
Yesterday when you
came to the cabaret,
l´d just been telling Hans Vergerus
about all our trouble.
He suggested at once
that we could move into this flat
that St. Anna´s Clinic has the use of.
lt just became vacant.
Please say it´s nice.
We don´t have to pay
any rent for the time being.
He also said that you could work
in the clinic´s archives.
We could stay here and decide
what we wanted to do.
l´ll be damned if l´ll live here
or accept charity from that
goddamned Hans Vergerus.
Maybe it´s better if we
work things out alone.
l probably won´t
see you for a while.
lt´s best not to mix things up.
There is no point
in continuing here in Berlin.
Look around you, Mr. Rosenberg.
Sixteen people,
and what a program.
May l offer you
anything to drink? A cognac?
A cognac for Mr. Rosenberg.
What do you think, Mr. Rosenberg?
A cabaret and a brothel...
ln Beirut, for example.
A totally different climate.
A totally different ambience.
We´ll close earlier tonight
and shorten the program.
lt´s useless staying open.
l´ve never seen
anything like this rain.
Maybe it´s the flood.
Cheers, Mr. Rosenberg.
How do you like
my English accent?
Marvelous.
l lived for some years
with a woman fakir from New Jersey.
She taught me
all the English l know.
l´ve been expecting this.
Can´t you sleep?
l have to be drunk
to go to sleep.
l´ve half a bottle of gin in
the small suitcase out in the kitchen.
You know, actually it´s
quite nice to have a fever.
You can daydream.
You fall asleep
and then you wake up.
Everything´s mixed up.
Suddenly you´re 6 years old,
and then l´m 15.
lt´s all so clear.
That damn engine.
lt´s started up again.
- What engine?
- Don´t you hear it?
l can hear something rumbling.
Yes! lt´s an engine.
That bathrobe you´re wearing
belonged to Papa.
lt´s quite touching.
l can remember
sitting in the sunshine
watching Papa
practicing a new number.
lt didn´t work very good.
Mama came out
of the wagon and said,
´´You´re not doing it right.´´
And she showed him how to do it.
He just stood
and looked embarrassed
with a sheepish smile on his face.
Now what´s the worst thing?
People have no future.
People have lost the future.
l´m getting drunk...finally.
May l introduce myself?
l am Dr. Soltermann,
and this is my colleague
Dr. Silbermann.
We are, as you
might have guessed,
in charge
of St. Anna Clinic´s archives,
the largest
hospital archives in Europe
and one of the largest
in the world.
We have floor space
of several thousand square meters,
and our card index includes
over 100,000 entries.
But then, the St. Anna Clinic has
been in existence for 357 years...
in various guises, of course.
May l show you
to your place, Herr Rosenberg?
Yes, thank you.
Dr. Silbermann and l are
very grateful to have an assistant.
We have been complaining
to our chief, Professor Vergerus,
for years to no avail.
So you must know you are
very welcome, Herr Rosenberg.
You are very welcome,
Herr Rosenberg.
Don´t you think Dr. Soltermann
speaks very good English?
- Very good.
- Dr. Silbermann is far too kind.
l spent seven years
in England before the war.
My doctor´s thesis dealt
with erotic perversions
in the writings of Ben Johnson,
an interesting but limited subject.
We go here, please.
May l ask, Herr Rosenberg,
if you have had any previous
experience in archive work?
- No. Unfortunately l´ve--
- l was afraid so, but never mind.
Today l can give you
a responsible task
that calls for very little
archive experience.
l´m very grateful.
How do l find my way out?
At dinnertime either Dr. Silbermann
or l will come for you.
You can rely on us.
We won´t forget you.
By the way,
one thing l almost forgot--
all our material
is strictly confidential.
lt mustn´t be taken out of here,
and you mustn´t read
or try to decipher the documents
that pass through your hands.
All the files are full of reports
of inconceivable human suffering,
of the battles of science,
its victories and defeats.
This will be your place,
Herr Rosenberg.
We begin work each morning
at 8:00 and finish at 6:00.
We have dinner at 1 :30.
We take turns to fetch it
from the kitchen of the clinic.
We are also entitled to take home
our supper in a special container.
These days that´s
a priceless emolument.
Good morning, Herr Rosenberg.
Excuse me for asking.
What am l supposed to do?
You see these gray files here?
There are yellow files
of a cheaper kind.
Your first task will be to remove
the contents of the gray files...
...and transfer them
to the yellow files,
after which you will
number and letter them
in the same way as the gray ones.
Good luck, Herr Rosenberg.
- How´s it going?
- lt´s hard work.
- You´re not well.
- No.
Did you have something
to eat today?
We have dinner
in the hospital staff dining room.
When do you knock off?
l think l get away at 7:00.
l can take supper from the kitchen.
lt´s part of the salary.
How are you getting on
in the archives?
Fine.
l don´t think l ought
to stand here any longer.
They´re terribly strict.
You suddenly look
so thin and pale.
l´m all right, Abel.
lt could have been worse.
l must hurry.
- Couldn´t you just say you´re sick?
- l don´t dare.
- You were nearly run over.
- Thanks.
- How do you like it here with us?
- l´ve only just started.
- And Manuela?
- Ask her yourself.
Let´s meet one evening,
the three of us.
l´m in a hurry.
Dr. Soltermann
went home after dinner.
He´s in poor health.
l´m usually alone here
in the archives nowadays.
With Dr. Soltermann away,
l can say it.
Something terrible
is going on here.
What?
Here, at the clinic.
Do you know what these are,
Herr Rosenberg?
l don´t understand German.
They are reports,
detailed reports, marked ´´secret.´´
So?
Reports concerning certain
experiments undertaken at the clinic
under the supervision
of Professor Vergerus.
l don´t get it.
Can you guess what kind
of experiments, Herr Rosenberg?
How could l?
Very strange experiments.
Strange?
Experiments with human beings,
Herr Rosenberg.
The engine is driving me wild.
l didn´t notice it.
But you do hear it, don´t you?
Yes, when you mention it.
- lt´s a trap.
- What is?
Don´t be an idiot.
We´re locked in.
Don´t get hysterical, Abel.
My head is splitting!
- You sure this gas isn´t leaking?
- lt isn´t.
- How can you be sure?
- Because l´ve tried it.
Then you did think
it was leaking, didn´t you?
Stop raving at me
like a lunatic.
lf you want to leave, go!
So you want me to get out?
l just say if you want to leave,
you can go.
l´ve done everything l can
to keep us together.
l just can´t go on anymore.
Do you hear what l´m saying?
l can´t go on anymore!
l give a damn about your fear!
l give a damn about you!
Then you want me to leave.
No.
l give up.
l give up.
l can´t.
- Just stay close.
- No, l can´t.
Lie still.
l can´t stay like this.
A little while, Abel?
Go away.
Come home with me.
lt´s warm.
You can have it
any way you want.
You have dollars, don´t you?
Go to hell!
Where do you think we are?
Come on. Come on.
You´re trying to kill me!
You´re trying to drain me!
You´re trying to suck me!
Stella says l can´t fuck!
That bitch is jiving
the whole goddamn world.
She´s got fangs in her cunt, man.
Fangs! ln her cunt!
l saw them! l did!
l saw them!
Mike, tell her that you and l
have screwed seven times
in at least seven different ways.
Mikaela, you know Monroe,
and you know damned well
he can only fuck faggots.
And if you say he even
half screwed you, you´re lying.
Do you remember that time?
Do you remember that time, Stella,
you had to go to the hospital because
you thought you had syphilis?
- l didn´t have syphilis!
- But you thought you did.
Who was that sweet man
who laid up next to you every night,
stroking you, making you feel fine,
at the risk of catching it?
You´d like some? lt´s nice.
- l didn´t have syphilis!
- But you thought you had syphilis!
You looked lousy!
You are lousy.
You used to be so beautiful.
She used to be so beautiful.
But now you are the worst bitch
on the whole of Steinstrasse.
You l could screw anytime.
lt´s just that...that...
that big-mouth bitch
that makes me nervous!
l could screw you...
l could screw you
any amount of times.
You see, l´m not a queer!
lt´s just a goddamn lie
Stella goes around telling everybody
because l won´t
get in between her legs!
A man could die in there!
You l could screw anytime!
- Here?
- What do you mean, here?
You say you could
screw her anytime.
- Could you do it now?
- You´re like that!
Sure! Sure, l could! Sure!
lf you think you´re going to watch
for nothing, then you´re crazy.
Come on, Monroe, let´s show him
what you´re made of.
- l´m going to bet on this.
- How about it?
You´ll be a rich man, Monroe.
Let´s go, Monroe, before l´m down.
You can have all the money from
that guy who won´t tell us his name.
Wait, wait, wait.
Quiet now.
No fair laughing.
l´ll help him.
He has to do it himself.
Say it, say it.
Say it, say it, say it.
lt doesn´t work!
Say it!
Say, ´´Do it, Daddy.´´
Say, ´´Do it, Daddy´´!
Say it.
Monroe, don´t cry.
Don´t cry, Monroe.
We won! We won!
Stop laughing. Stop laughing!
On the morning
of Wednesday, November 7th,
there is no milk
to be had in Berlin.
Many food shops remain closed.
They have nothing to sell.
The Reichsmark has
practically ceased to exist.
The wads of bills are now
counted by weight,
and no more notice is taken
of the printed value.
When you began your employment,
l pointed out that working hours
are from 8:00 to 6:00.
Could you be so kind
as to show me to my workplace?
l can´t find my way.
Of course.
Are there other people
here in the archives?
Of course.
Every day we are visited
by scientists from other institutions.
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
You behave most improperly
to an old man.
lt´s all so absurd and humiliating.
Surely you realize
l won´t tell you anything,
no matter how rough you are.
Unlike you, l have a conviction.
Something unheard of is
happening down there in Munich.
A savior is born.
The delivery is taking place
in pain and blood.
A terrible time is at hand.
But what are 30 or 40 years
of suffering and death?
What do you or l matter?
What do even millions
of lives matter?
There are plenty
of human beings, Herr Rosenberg.
Kill me, Herr Rosenberg.
l won´t resist.
My body is weak,
but my soul is strong and calm.
l think it´s better l lock the door
so that no one will disturb us.
Dr. Soltermann
warned me against you,
but l didn´t believe him.
You say nothing.
Look at the screen and you´ll see
some interesting pictures.
They were taken
during our experiments
here at the St. Anna Clinic.
This is a resistance experiment.
This woman, 30 years old,
volunteered to look after
a four-month-old baby
with a brain injury
who screams day and night.
We wanted to see
what would happen
to this completely normal,
fairly intelligent woman
if we shut her in with a child
that never stopped screaming.
As you see, after 12 hours
she is still quite self-possessed.
Now, however,
24 hours have passed.
We can see now
that she is affected.
Her sympathy for the sick child
has been wiped out,
her feelings replaced
by a deep depression,
which in its turn
paralyzes every initiative.
She has left the child to its fate.
Here we can see quite clearly
the thought of ridding herself
of the child has developed.
But it took another six hours
before she carried out her intention,
a remarkable resistance.
Unfortunately our camera
didn´t manage
to document the actual deed.
Our technique has not
been quite perfected.
You would like to see more,
wouldn´t you?
For seven days, this man
was shut up in a cell so constructed
that he could not move
his arms, legs, or head.
ln addition, he was
deprived of all sound
and was in total darkness.
l know what you are
going to say, Abel.
You are wondering how we
could get anyone to agree
to such an experiment voluntarily.
No trouble, l assure you.
People will do anything for
a little money and a square meal.
These pictures are not
particularly instructive
but may be
of physiognomic interest.
The subject was give an injection
of Thanatoxin,
a drug that produces
violent anguish.
What you will see is someone
subjected to unbearable agony.
Here you see him just
as he´s given the injection.
You notice that he
is quite balanced
and is laughing and joking.
An unusually nice boy, incidentally.
He was a student of
political science at the university.
We are now
at the condition of dread,
which is getting worse and worse.
ln a few moments
he´ll commit suicide.
Watch carefully. lt happens
without any warning.
He picks up the revolver.
You can´t see it properly.
Now you can see it.
Then he puts it in his mouth.
The gun is not loaded, of course.
That student really did
shoot himself a few days later,
although the effects of the Thanatoxin
had completely worn off.
Your brother Max...
met with the same misfortune.
By the way, he was one
of our best assistants.
He was really interested
in our experiments.
He wanted to try out
the Thanatoxin.
l advised him not to,
but he insisted.
His fiancée also
helped us quite a bit.
They were very attached
to each other and lived for a time
in one of the apartments
that you, yourself...
This is one of our most recent
and interesting experiments.
The subjects are administered
carefully controlled doses
of Kapta Blue,
a virtually odorless gas.
lnitially the gas plays tricks
with the behavioral centers,
throwing the entire emotional
balance out of kilter.
The subjects are stripped
of their social defenses,
lose their inhibitions,
teeter madly
between quickly changing moods
which possess them.
Their reactions are so farcical,
at times one can hardly
keep from laughing.
Of course, repeated
exposure to Kapta Blue
can cause some permanent damage.
Perhaps you are wondering
what my intentions were
with you and Manuela,
placing you in one
of our experiment rooms.
Will you believe me if l tell you
l had no intentions at all?
Except to help you.
As you saw, the building behind
your rooms had been vacated.
Some time ago we were forced
to transfer our activities
to a more out-of-the-way place.
We must take great care.
Besides, our economic
resources are limited.
We are financed entirely
by private means.
l´m not a monster, Abel.
What you have seen
are the first faltering steps
of a necessary
and logical development.
l know you have told
lnspector Bauer of your experiences.
l also know that justice, represented
by the plodding inspector,
has begun to move,
slow and creaking.
He´ll be here soon with his police
and his rusty guns.
But in a few moments,
l´ll bite on this cyanide capsule.
l did consider
burning the archives
and destroying
the results of our work,
but it seemed too melodramatic.
The law will confiscate our results
and then file them.
ln a few years, science
will ask for the documents
and will continue our experiments
on a gigantic scale.
We are ahead of our time, Abel.
We are to be sacrificed.
lt´s only logical.
ln a day or two,
maybe even tomorrow,
the national units in South Germany
will attempt a revolt
led by an incredible scatterbrain
called Adolf Hitler.
lt will be a colossal fiasco.
Herr Hitler lacks intellectual
capacity and method.
He doesn´t realize
what tremendous forces
he is about to conjure up.
He will be swept away
like a withered leave
the day the storm breaks.
Look at that picture.
Look at all those people.
They are incapable
of a revolution.
They are far too humiliated,
too afraid, too downtrodden.
But in ten years...
By then...
the 10-year-olds will be 20,
the 15-year-olds will be 25.
To the hatred
inherited from their parents,
they will add their own
idealism and impatience.
Someone will step forward and put
their unspoken feelings into words.
Someone will promise a future.
Someone will make demands.
Someone will talk
of greatness and sacrifice.
The young and inexperienced will
give their courage and their faith
to the tired and the uncertain.
And then there will be a revolution,
and our world will go down
in blood and fire.
ln ten years, no more,
those people will create a new society
unequalled in world history.
The old society was based
on extremely romantic ideas
of man´s goodness.
lt was all very complicated since
the ideas didn´t match the reality.
The new society will be based
on a realistic assessment
of man´s potentials
and limitations.
Man is a malformation,
a perversity of nature.
That is where
our experiments come in.
We deal with the basic
construction and reshape it.
We set the productive forces free
and control the destructive ones.
We exterminate what is inferior
and increase what is useful.
l always liked you and Manuela.
She showed an affection for me
which l hope was sincerely meant.
Against my better judgment,
l tried to help you.
Comic, isn´t it, Abel?
One day you can tell all this
to anyone who is willing to listen.
No one will believe you
despite the fact that anyone
who makes the slightest effort
can see what is
waiting in the future.
lt´s like a serpent´s egg.
Through the thin membranes,
you can clearly discern
the already perfect reptile.
You were given Veronal.
You´ve slept for two days.
What day is it?
lt´s the morning
of November 1 1th.
- Can l have some water?
- Yeah.
l´ve been in touch with Hollinger.
He thinks he can use you
in his circus.
The German state will pay
for a train ticket to Basel.
That´s where the circus will be
for the next two weeks.
l take it for granted that you
will accept his kind offer, no?
l think so.
lt would be
the simplest way, Herr Rosenberg.
A constable will go
to the station with you.
The night train is supposed
to leave at 1 1 :20.
Thank you.
Good-bye, Herr Rosenberg.
By the way,
Herr Hitler failed
with his Munich putsch.
The whole thing
was a colossal fiasco.
Herr Hitler and his gang
underrated the strength
of the German democracy.
Good-bye, Herr Rosenberg.
On the evening
of Sunday, November 1 1th,
Abel Rosenberg escaped
the police escort
which was taking him
to the railroad station.
He was never seen again.
