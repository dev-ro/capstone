It’s raining, I’m also wet.
You're Mr.Anbarasu?

Okay, Mr. Anbarasu, your
Room Number is 213.
Yes sir.
My key.
Your close friend is waiting there.
My...Who? -Mr.Sivam, sir.
Yes, come in.
Keep the coffee on the table.
What coffee?
l thought, I had heard this
voice somewhere.
Mr.Aras, welcome.
Now, you're calling me by my name.
Then, why did you say ''Anbarasu'' in
the reception?
Why? Full name.
l don't like ANBU.(love)
Sir, you shouldn't hate love.
''Those who don't love are selfish''...
Those who love''....
Wow! You speak Oriya Language also?
Sir, it's very bad...
It’s Tamil! Mr.Thiruvalluvar, white beard,
man near Sanskrit college, Mylapore.
Statute....sitting.
Listen.
Don't bore me.
I’ve had really bad day.
I’m very angry that...
Shall I say one thing?
I know, what you are going to say...
You're going to ask me one thing.
I know, what you're going to ask me...
I should ask you why you’re after me
I haven’t asked even that
So, what else will I ask?
You'll say.....
Like a Kangaroo's baby ...
l kept this safely in my front pocket
and brought it without getting wet.
You might've suffered a lot
without this, haven't you?
No thanks.
You can make a call here itself.
Is it a personal call?
Is it a "love call'?
No such thing.....
I too don't have one KAAL(leg)
and one KAI(hand).
Hi handsome.
After taking bath, I’m looking
a bit handsome.
Sorry...l kept them outside...
Oh! I placed my leg on them just now.
Thank you.
You returned my phone, I returned
your bags. We're even.
What's this? Bad smell is coming.
l...
Oh! You're...! Go and take bath.
I want to make a call.
Sir, make a call later.
Otherwise, you won't get hot water. Go...
Okay.
Hello, Mr.A.Aras has gone
for his bath.
Give me that.
Sir, what's all this?
l only said Aras, not 'Anbarasu'.
-I know.
l didn't mean that.
l didn't enter the bathroom.
l can't attend the call.
Sir, this is from "public call office'.
I know that, that's my office, man.
You too...
Why didn't you call me
from your house?
Did they make a call?
Missed calls? Okay.
Ask them to phone me again.
Sir, you received missed calls.
....Why didn't you...
Sir, there were 4 missed calls.
You get angry when I handle
your cell in your presence.
How can I take your calls
in your absence?
4 missed calls.
Sir, who is Sarasu?
She is my....
How do you know?
l read ''Sarasu'' on those missed calls.
Sir, who's she?
Do you want to know everything?
What I know is little, what
I don't know is vast...
I’ll take bath and come.
You're taking that like a soap...
Take this towel...
One more thing is that
the hot water shower...
Hey, thank you very much
I’ll manage.
What I mean is...
When I opened it...
Sir, why've you hanged it
like this?
Underwear.
Why have you hanged it
like a "party flag'?
l thought I could at least
wash that and wear.
Sir, you put it aside
and take bath.
How? -With your hand.
It’s washed. You put it aside
and take bath.
Then, that shower head
is a bit...
Oh God! I know, I’ve taken shower
bath several times.
l didn't mean that.
That shower head is...
I’ll manage, leave me alone.
-Sir, what was the noise?
Sir, nothing. I kicked the
bloody bucket, man.
Why did you shout after
kicking the bucket?
Oh God! Sir, I’ve kicked
the bucket.
Do you've to cross examine
me for everything?
Yeah, just a minute.
-May I come in, sir?
Come in.
What? Man...
Sorry sir, coffee.
You poured it on my head, man.
l was opening the door, isn't it?
Before that, why did you
say "Come in'?
When he asked, "May I come in?',
We're supposed to say
'Come in', shouldn't we?
Sir, shower head fell on your head.
And you lied that you
kicked the bucket.
Sir, why didn't you inform me
that shower head is not secure?
Sir, I wanted to tell you...
You cut me short and said that you've
taken shower bath several times.
Then, we were talking
about my underwear.
After that also, I tried
to warn you...
You didn't listen to me...
And got hurt.
You can give 1000's of excuses.
You're an expert at that.
Sir, you've got a big lump.
Sir, it's alright, if there's bleeding,
it'll be a problem. -Why?
Because, my blood group
is 'AB Negative'. It’s a rare group.
l know sir, I’m 'O Positive'.
l....
You too have 'O'...
You said 'AB Negative'.
I’m AB Negative. You're 'O'...
What I mean is....
Bloody confusion.
Phone call.
Hello, Hi honey, Aras here.
Yes, here there's a cyclone
and heavy floods.
Train, plane...everything
is cancelled.
What could I do? Cell was not with me.
No...It’s not cyclone.
It’s a pillow.
It’s a fellow.
No...
It’s a fellow with a pillow.
That cyclone is better than this....
I’ll come outside and talk...
Just a minute....
He...?
Very nice gentleman.
He's my friend whom I met here.
He's very irritating and
a pain in my neck...
He asks questions and gives
suggestions for everything.
Thinking he’s helping me
he’s pestering me. Hello...
No...Will you call from the land line?
Just a minute...I’ll give
you the numbers.
This place? It’s a God forsaken hotel.
Hello, open the door.
Open the door, please.
Yeah...Yeah...please....
l can't tell you.
He's a real joker.
He's not the joker of 'Rummy'.
He's a real joker. Real joker.
Mother, you too have started
talking like him...
Oh God! Sir...Sir...
Thank God, you swim and come out....
No, I can't swim.
Sir, won't you speak in Tamil
even while you're dying?
l can't swim....
Say like that.
You hold this and come out.
''A talented person can
use even a pillow''.
Is that all necessary now?
Sorry sir.
I feel very sorry...-Why?
Because I didn't die?
Sir, don't talk like that.
Think in this way...
You were sorry that you didn't get a
room in a 5 Star Hotel. lf you had,
The room could've been on
the 5th or 6th floor...
lf you had fallen down from there...
-Sir, won't you ever think positively?
It’s not that....Sorry.....
Sir, don't plug it.
Because, micro processor
might be wet.
Even at the petrol bunk, they warn
not to switch on the cell.
Because, it can cause fire
Sir, you claim to know everything.
Don't I know anything?
It’s not that...
Let me do my work, man.
Go ahead...go ahead.
You give your opinion and
suggestion for everything.
l mean there's a limit to everything.
Am I a child to be advised
all the time...
Sir, don't I know about electronics?
l have used and charged
cell phones many times!
Don't talk....
Don't laugh....
It happens man.
Hello...Hello...Please tell me.
Reception? I want to make an
urgent call to Chennai, please.
Sorry sir, no STD
-No STD! Trunk call? -No.
Messaging? -No sir.
E-Mail? -No sir
Telegram? -No.
Then, how?
Pigeon...-Yes...Pigeon....
Pura?(Pigeon) What Pura?
Pardon me.
Pigeon...? What do you mean?
Very funny...Thank you.
We'll become old by the
time we reach Chennai.
Sir, only now, I’m happy. -Why?
You've a sense of humour.
But, I don't know, whether I can
smile or not? Can I smile?
Only couples come to this hotel?
They've kept only one bed.
Now, we've share this and....
Sir, I didn't mean that...
You tell me where do you
want to sleep and I...
No...I’ll sleep on the floor.
Because, I have a bad back.
In the spinal chord, there's a slip disk.
Disc-Slip...Accident -You know.
l should sleep only on hard surface.
Are you sure, you want to...
Are you okay?
Yeah...yeah....
Are you sure, you're okay?
Okay...okay...-Okay, then.
Good night Mr.Sivam.
Unbelievable.
What? -Cyclones, rains...winds...
These are common in Orissa.
People face them every year.
Every year, they say
it'll hit Chennai.
But, it hits only Orissa and Andhra...
It’s a great pity!
Sir, you can see a huge wave here.
Sir, you can see 'Tsunami' here.
Sir, do you know the meaning of 'Tsunami'?
l know the meaning of "Tsunami'.
-Tell me, what's it?
That is....That big wave.
Very good.
No...It’s a big mountain.
You've studied abroad, haven't you?
Sir, tell me the height
of "Liberty Statue'?
300 feet.-Very good.
Why do you say "very good' for everything.
Is it an examination?
No, sir it's just an appreciation
of your knowledge.
You said the height of
Liberty Statue is 300 ft.
Here, it seems the waves will
be 250 ft. high.
In Orissa? -Yes, sir.
They said.
Impossible.
I’ve only heard. But, we can find a wave
about 50 ft. high in Danushkodi.
Sir, don't you think
it's an "over exaggeration'?
No, it's not.
Such a wave swept away my father.
What do you mean?
l mean, it swept away my father.
My father was very
interested in photography.
He asked me to click his
snap with the swell of the wave.
He said ''It’ll look nice''.
We got a good print of the wave.
But father was gone.
What do you mean by that?
We didn't even get his body.
It means he died, isn't it?
I’m sorry, Mr.Sivam.
Excuse me, I’d like a first class ticket
to Chennai please, by Coromandel Express.
All trains cancelled.
What?
Cancelled.
Excuse me, I’m a Tax-payer.
You're answerable to me.
Tell me one good reason why I can't
take a train to Chennai?
What's this?...What's this?
Pointing....
Is it a railway station
or a harbour? -What?
What?
Nothing man...
Time! -It’s a bad time.
-Time! Time!
Hey stop!...Thief... Police...
Emergency...Ambulance! Stop! Stop!
Stop... Wait... stop...
You.. you.. you... Thief.
Oh God! I don't know how to swim.
Stop him, he's running with my purse.
Thief! Dacoit! Stop him!
Hey stop!.. Give me my purse.
Don't try to beat me...
Whatever it is, we'll adjust.
Stop.. Stop man!
Catch.. catch.. stop.. stop!
Don't know whether he
knows English or not.
Is it very important?
He has taken away my purse.
Isn't this your purse?
He has taken the cash and
ran away...Is it enough?
Is there no policeman or
a police station here?
Railway station itself is submerged.
-Yes, how can a police station exist?!
l think, it's in that corner.
-Sir, please...
Don't touch my bag.
Wait...
He's from this town.
He'll bring the bag safely.
How do you know that
he's not a thief?
Sir, I’m not a thief.
I’m an old friend of comrade.
He's my friend, Misro.
This is Aras. -I’m sorry...
Without knowing that you're a Tamilian,
l mistook you for a thief.
It’s alright, I feel sorry that you
lost your money in our town.
I’m very sorry.
-No problem.
Credit card is left. Thank God!.
That bag...
That bag...
Wait...Let it be there itself.
We'll go and take it.
You go...We'll bring this bag...
This bag? -We'll bring this bag....
-Don't laugh man.
It didn't happen like that.
I’ve never seen thieves...
Are we friendly with thieves
and running their association?
lf you had asked in the hotel, they
would've told you that there's no train.
At least you could've asked me...
Was I so soundly asleep that
you couldn't wake me up?
I would've not got this bag,
if he wasn't there.
It’s nothing. Why are you making
it into a big issue?
Sir, it's a big thing.
Guess how much money
I’ve in this bag?
Sir, I don't know, but I know
how much money I had.
Rs.4000. He has stolen it.
At least he left the credit cards.
Thank god!.
I have Rs.32 lakhs in this bag.
It’s true, sir.You tell him.
In Orissa, 100 Tamilians
died when the dam broke.
He argued in the court with the
help of our Union.
Only now, he got the compensation.
Now, he's going to hand over
the check.
It’s very rare to see such a person.
-Tell me the details.
I didn't argue, the lawyer won the case.
I’m just a messenger to
hand over the check.
But, if Mr. Misro was not there
it would've taken one more year.
Without knowing the Oriya language...
Oh God! Look where the car is!
It would've been thrown up there
by the floods. Let's go.
That bloody man was responsible
for this...Sister ****.
Do you know him?
-No, let's go...
Do you've any sisters?
-No...
Then, don't worry. Keep going.
Don't use bad words.
Why are you abusing him?
What're you saying?
He doesn't have any sisters.
He's assuming wrongly that you do.
Technically wrong.
-Yeah, very funny?
Technical aspects? Don't laugh!
It's insulting.
Yes, your city is very bad.
We don't know what they're
bad mouthing.
From here, if we go to Andhra and
go straight to Tamil Nadu.
We can at least understand
their bad mouthing.
It’s very funny.Very funny.
I’ve Rs.15 and you've Rs.5.
How can we go with this amount?
Till Orissa border...
-We can go by bus.
Sir, how can we go with this
meagre amount?
We'll get a seat for this money also.
Come on.
Sir, the man next to me is
chewing tobacco.
Ask him to either chew tobacco or
play the flute. -Why?
I’m getting wet in the shower of his
tobacco mixed spittle...
It’s very unhygienic.
You should be one of the crowd
in a public place.
You'll want make adjustments
by remote control.
This is world not a T.V. set.
-I know the world.
l know people.
Don't try to teach me everything.
I’ve traveled a lot.
I’m very friendly also.
Hi! Aras here!
Are you okay? See...
Will you eat this?
-Oh thank you.
Ask him not to eat.
-Don't eat it.
What?
I’ve eaten in North Indian road
side eateries. No problem.
I’ve got a very good immune system.
And my health is also very good.
Do you have one more?
Don't eat one more, if you eat
you'll go crazy.
Mata...? -Yes, mata (forehead).
"Mata' means "Mother'.
Is he scolding me?
He'll feel dizzy. -He means that,
you'll faint and fall down.
Lie! You don't know Oriya, do you?
I don't know Oriya, but I
know about that drug...
Drug? You mean a narcotic or something?
It’s a ball made out of cannabis paste.
What'll happen if I eat this?
After eating it, you'll walk
on all fours.
Yela Machi Machi
Singers: Kamal Haasan & Udit Narayan.
Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu
Buddy, you've gone crazy
and lost your sense.
What happened to me, I feel butterflies
fluttering in my mind.
Your kick has gone up
like American Dollars.
Our brains have come down like
Indian rupees.
When we get a kick...
"Knowledge gets increased'.
After the kick comes down, knowledge
gained will decrease.
We should've some kick in life.
Or else, we won't have strength.
Mother's milk as well as liquor,
both give us kick.
You're not clever enough to
differentiate between them.
Mother's milk gives the kick
only for few months.
But, the kick of liquor will
remain for our entire life.
Kick may change...
Will your mind change?
Can a dog's tail ever be straightened?
My chicken are gone...
My hen...hen...
What?
Hen.
I’ve a credit card.
-No, I want money.
What do you want?
Life is a treasure trove,
the strongest will take it.
Is it wrong to be selfish?
Don't usurp his livelihood.
lf a worker sleeps with an empty stomach,
this country will ruin.
You're an excellent debater.
You seem to be a lawyer's relative?
You're mesmerizing me
with your words.
You're selling ice-cubes
in the Himalayas.
Sit down... sit down...
Hey, sit down...Sit down
Look there.
Stop the bus! Stay put there.
-Right..right..
Be careful....Slowly.
Oh God! He got hurt
in the stomach.
Do you've stomach-ache?
-No, I’m feeling hungry.
What's this? You've ordered
so many items.
Have you got any hidden money?
I’ve got all the credit cards.
In India, we can eat
anything, anywhere.
It’s not accepted just in your bus.
After eating, what our friend
gave me in the bus...
Do you accept Credit cards here?
What's that?
Sweet?
He's unaware of credit cards. Wants to 
know if it’s a sweet of some kind.
Shall we inform him?
No. Poor guy just became sober 
and is happily eating. Let him eat.
Cash?
Nothing.You do one thing…
..just keep eating.
I’ll go finish some work.
I don't know why, laughter and
hunger keep alternating.
Your bill..
Sorry!
What's this?
Pay in cash.
What?
It seems, he won't accept credit card?
Money...He wants cash payment.
You should've told me earlier!
Excuse me, no cash, only card.
I won't accept all that.
No money, you're not leaving this place.
What did he say?
He said he won't allow you to go
without getting the cash.
Whom are you shouting at?
Why won’t you let me leave?
I don't want all that.
I need my money in cash.
No! Why didn't you display a board
saying “Credit card not accepted”?
Without paying the bill,
I won’t allow you to go out.
What're you talking about?
Cash...cash.. What cash? I’ll bash you up.
Cash... cash...
Give cash... cash..
Look...cash...
Thank you, Mr. Sivam.
How much do I owe you?
You don't owe me anything.
Here, take this.
What's this?
How did you get money?
We'll talk about it outside
Come on....
Thank you, Mr. Sivam.
I won't forget this.
My shoe...Sir, my shoes are missing.
Sir, my shoe...
My shoes are missing.
They've stolen my shoes...
What type of a hotel is this?
I’m going to call the police.
That's what, I mean...
My shoes are missing.
Sir, don't shout...
Don't shout...-What is it?
You've eaten, haven't you?
It was your shoes that you ate.
This is the balance.
Thank you. -Okay.
Wonderful.
Wow! Excellent.
I’m walking with bare foot like an idiot..
Are you a great army officer that
you're polishing your shoes?
Not polishing. I’m washing them.
Wash!
Sir, wait...Wait....
Italian designer shoe.
They were worth Rs.10,000.
Hereafter, we both have to
walk without shoes.
Listen man, don't you ever
touch my things again, okay?
Don’t be so dramatic.
Did your break your leg into 2
just by my touch?
Sir, wait!
One of my legs became shorter
in an accident I was in.
It’s not just your shoes…
Mine are designer shoes too!
Yours is Italian. But, mine too was 
designed in a hospital.
Thank you Mr. Misro.
I’m really sorry, Mr. Sivam.
I lost my cool. Thanks.
Thank you Mr. Misro.
I’m really sorry, Mr. Sivam.
Okay, stop holding them like that,
like Bharat (from Ramayan)!
Sorry, Mr. Misro.
Why are you apologizing to me?
-He's right.
Sir, I’m in a confused state.
Will any fool go to Bhubaneswar to see
location on the eve of his marriage?
Who's that fool?
And who's getting married?
Sir, I’m the fool...I’m the one
who's going to get married.
Wow! Really?
Congratulations!
Why all this? Let's see whether it
goes through...Don't worry.
Comrade will take you safely
to your place.
Go straight and turn left and catch the
Coromandel express, you'll reach Chennai.
Straight to Chennai in 1 7 hours.
Where are you going? -My place is
nearby. I’ll take leave.
Bye! bye Comrade!
-Okay, bye!
Where are you going?
-I’m not going anywhere.
Don't forget your shoes...
Can I forget them? I’ll first wear
socks and then put them on..
You wear your shoes and I’ll wear mine.
...Then, we'll go together.
We'll go...but if you
wear my shoes...
Do you mean that we should
wear one each?
Wow! You're smiling!
Sorry sir.
I didn't appreciate your
joke because I was in tension...
Not only that…. after
taking that cannabis.
I feel like crying when
I hear jokes.
Yes.
Okay, you put on your shoes.
I’ve another pair. I’ll wear that.
Then, we'll go together.
Sir, Is there any train
to Chennai from here?
Coromandel Express may arrive.
Will it stop here?
It has to!
How long will it stop?

No..no sir! How long will the
Coromandel train stop here?

No..no.. please stop joking.
Please tell me.
How long will the Coromandel train
stop here?

I’ve understood.
-What?

Oh come on man!
From 1:58 to 2:02
2 to 2 to 2:02.
Oh 2 to 2 to ....
He can't get it.
Explain to him.
Is that so?
-I got it.
Listen! Are you sure
the train will come?
Okay! Are you sure it'll come?
Who can give surety?
Sir, I’ve a question.
-Go ahead...
Do you've a telephone?
I too want to ask him one thing.
Excuse me... please..
Is there a phone I can use?
Wait, he asked first.
Yes sir, there's a telephone.
Okay, can I make a phone call?
-Please.. please, let me go first.
Sir, I’ve to make this really important
personal phone call.
You two decide between you two.
Why?
One phone, one call...
But why? -Because I’m the
station master, that's why.
What's your name?
-Sivam
What's your name?
Jesus Christ!
Mr. Christ,
You go and make a call...go...
You go and make a phone call.
-Thank you.
I’ve the key.
Where is he going?
You seem to be happy.
Are you married?
-Yeah?
Mr. Christ, wait.
What?
Thank you and sorry.
What for?
Station master said only one
phone call can be made.
And I’ve made it.
You can try another.
I’m not in a hurry. It’s just to inform
them that I’m on my way.
But your case is different.
Emergency.
It’s about love.
How did you know?
-I can read your eyes.
Are you so experienced?
Why not? Shouldn't I’ve had the
experience of falling in love?
Sure.
But you? Falling in love?
Why not?
Of course!
Definitely.
I mean, every dog has it's day.
...and they say love is blind...so..
Sorry.. That came out bad.
I’m sorry, I didn't mean that.
When did you first meet?
You mean the dog?
Where did you first meet
your girl?
In the middle of the street
with my music band.
Let me guess.
In a temple festival?
In a marriage procession?
What were you doing?
I was spreading a message.
Oh, so you were a postman?
Messenger service?
You could say that too.
Even Jesus Christ was a messenger.
Can't you ever say something
in a straight-forward way?
Yep, I do. -What?
Messages!
Right! So...
What might that great
message be?
Nattukkoru Seithi Solli
Singers: Kamal Haasan, Chandran & Malathi.
Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu
A modern Jester has come
to spread a message.
I’m here to narrate a story beautifully
laced with songs and dances.
I’m here to narrate our
pains and struggle.
Listen to the story of 910.
Listen to the travails
of the workers.
All men and women, brothers and
sisters, listen to this.
Let's unmask the truth.
It’ll lead us into trouble.
We die and live everyday.
Our heads roll down everyday.
Gentlemen, in the beginning
of this story.
Our hero is a worker.
A Rs.910 salaried man.
When his co-workers were agitating for
salary hike near factory gate.
Dodging them, he slips out silently.
Where is he going?
Will the job come good if you
question while going for it?
He is going to ogle at girls.
He is going in search of
his lover.
Adding glitter to her golden looks,
she's charming him.
Your eyes are filling up the
void in my life.
The town bus is going empty,
let's go happily to a movie in that.
Your take home salary
is just Rs.910.
How will you bear the
burden of a family?
It seems to be a street play.
A play in the middle of the street!
Getting wisdom from his love
...Our story's hero...
Also jumps into the
arena of struggle.
There is a Law for minimum wages.
There is a plan not to reduce
even a penny from it.
Though there're umpteen
number of laws.
Some still manage to pay
meager salaries.
They'll eat the poor alive.
Who's that noble man cheating workers
and paying low salaries?
Look, he's over there.
Let's praise the mercy of God
and hail him.
Long live the man in whites.
Long live upcoming lndustrialist.
Long live Multi Business Tycoon.
Long live Business Magnet.
What do you mean by business magnet?
Business magnet.
Rap on his head.
Long live our leader.
We'll sing paeans hailing
your long life.
Ours is a blessing heart.
We'll always sing your praise.
Wow! He's very good.
Madam, they're criticizing
your father.
White dress, white beard.
Stopped short of mentioning his name.
Go and find out, what's it?
It seems, they want a hike.
Hm?.
It seems, they want a
hike in their salaries.
I can only give Rs.910.
It’s impossible to raise
even a penny.
How are you going to
manage them, boss?
I’ve planned a venture.
Our problems will be resolved
in the near future.
It’s a good news...At this juncture...
-Ask them, will they give way or not?
Joint ventures with
Multi National Companies. Joint venture!
They'll send raw materials
from their country.
We'll import.
We're refining here.
We're packing it here.
We're planning and marketing.
We'll get thrashed
if we fail to market it.
What're we going to import?
Tea!
Tea.
What?
Tea.
Hello Commissioner uncle...
-That's okay...That's okay.
What's the margin of profit?
Only this!?
MNC people will give you crumbs.
40%   to us.
60%   to him.
Then, what about the plight of
local tea producers?
Let them to go the hell!
Who's bothered?
For us, our foreign investors
are more important.
The profit we get in the
process is more important.
In a game of chess, as proprietors
make their move.
Will worker remain a mute spectator?
Or keep watching the fun silently?
Even if shore wants to rest,
waves will never allow it.
Even if trees want to take rest,
wind will not allow it.
Even if you run away and hide,
life will not leave you alone.
With a remote control
from somewhere.
He's playing havoc with
this country.
Where's the remote control?
To remote control us, there're people
in America, England, France and Germany.
We're not alone, we're a group.
I’ll take them to task.
Driver, let's go.
Our need now is a good decision.
Not just for this play.
For everyone.
Efforts from our side only
will not bring that.
Me, you, he, that man, this man.
Look there, the person who's blaring
horn and disturbing our play.
We all must join together.
...And decide unitedly.
We'll sing a new song. That'll accompany
us on a long journey.
Our song is not a lone voice, but a
vociferous war cry of the downtrodden lot.
A song that'll usher in a new era.
Our difficulties are same. Come and join
the voice of protest courageously.
Raise like a wave in protest.
Teach them weakness is not our character.
Make a move, don't restrict
to yourself.
It’s good.
An arrogant heroine,
revolutionary hero.
Nice story.
It’s new! -It’s not a story.
It’s my life.
Yes, it's your life.
As you think, Bala is not
an arrogant girl.
Excuse me!
It’s okay, you didn't mean it.
Even I came to the same conclusion
when I first saw her.
Only when I met her, the second time.
Do you know where I met her the
second time? Myself and Mehr.
Be careful, boy.
You be careful lady.
-Lady?
If I’m a boy because I’m wearing
a pair of trousers,
You're a lady because
you're wearing a skirt.
Why're you fighting with the
passersby on the road?
That's why, I told you
that I’ll drive.
Why don't you just admit that with 
your big "handle-bar" mustache...
..you feel embarrassed to be
driven by a woman?
Hey, did I say that?
-Come on, admit it.
Why're you beating around the bush?
You drive.
Nothing like that.
Hey! Are you blind?
Oh God! He has stopped the car
and is coming back.
Definitely, it must be an M.L.A's car.
We're going to get beaten up.
I’m very sorry, sir.
-Nalla
Madan sir, you painted a cartoon on me.
Autograph, please. -I’m terribly sorry.
You said that already.
He is Mr. Madan. She is Meher.
She's in our troupe.
She's also an architect.
Oh!...That gentleman?
Hey, what man..
What's your plan for dinner?
-At home.
Look, we're talking amongst ourselves.
Go on, then!
Too much water everywhere!
Tamil Nadu wouldn't quite be
what it is without all these people!
Okay. Let's go!
Where? -To dine.
My dress is soiled.
-Then, I’ll also stand here.
Driver, splash some on me too.
-No sir.
Then what? Come with me.
But where?
-Suspense!
But, the food will be delicious.
Greetings sir.
Are the dogs chained?
-Yes, they are.
Shut up, Tommy!
Hello Bala, how are you?
-Fine.
This is my aunt.
Greetings.
Yes.. yes! Come.
Let me introduce you to my friends.
Hello. -Thank you!
This is Felix. -Hello, Mr. Madan.
This is Manohar.
Uncle, check whether the dinner
is ready or not? -Okay!
Why're they here?
-You wait.
He's inside.
You don't want them, do you?
-Yeah..
Stop.
Why're you here?
Whom do you want to meet?
Cartoonist Madan invited us here.
There is no one like that.
Get out! Get out!
Sir, he invited us.
They're my guests.
Oh, your guests? Welcome, come in.
...Greetings.
Come on, Nalla.
Nalla, you were following me.
Why were you late?
You came luxuriously in a car.
We came by a two wheeler.
As it is, there are too many
dogs in this house.
Ask everyone to come
for dinner.
Excuse me!
Come, let's have dinner,
baby's waiting for us.
Hello Mr. Madan.
-Hello Mr. Ranjit.
One minute!
Excuse me, Ladies and Gentlemen!
I would like you to meet my father
Mr. Kandasamy Padayachi.
You've come to the lion's den and
how dare to twist your whiskers?
I’m just thinking about Mr. Padayachi
dancing to our local folk beat.
And that's my father,
Kandasamy Padayachi.
Greetings. Greetings to everyone.
Who's she?
She's with me.
Sorry, I’m...
-Her name is Mehrunnisa
All religions are equal in my house.
What do you say? -Yes.
Hail Lord Siva's mercy.
Father, he's Mr. Madan.
Welcome.
Since morning, Bala was anxiously
awaiting your arrival.
Boss, the one who's wearing green
shirt is Mr. Madan.
Don't I know that?
Hello Madan sir. I’m busy with
my business all the time.
I can't remember faces.
You've grown beard all of a sudden.
That's why I couldn't. -Oh God!
Since when you started sporting beard?
-I was always with a beard.
It looks good.
Look, don't be in a hurry
to catch the train.
The train won't start until
you board the train. I will take care of that!
Relax and enjoy your feast.
Okay Mr. Madan, see you.
-Won't you join us in the feast?
Hail Lord Siva!
-Boss is on a fast today.
No water too.
You carry on.
Dear, take care of him.
-Okay...
Nobody introduced me.
He's my father-in-law. -Greetings.
-Retired Magistrate.
Did you eat? -No.
Here's the dish you prepared.
Bring the other dishes.
Come on, bring them.
Oh my God!
What have you done Grandpa?
-Someone please come and clean it fast.
It's okay, just move over.-Sorry!
Forgive me.
It’s alright, Grandpa.
It’s alright.
I’m so sorry!
Don't worry. Accidents happen...
I was talking to him.
It’s alright. Why do you get upset
for such trivial things?
Nalla, come here.
Look, she has put a painting
on the dining table.
No, Madan sir.
She doesn't agree. The painting
is only visible to us.
Even we can see that.
Oh sorry.
What do you see? This's a fish and
that's a horse.
What do you see?
-I see many things, sir.
I think, Nalla is getting
into the mood.
Come on, Nalla.

Beautiful!
What can we do with the goat?
-We can only make soup out of it.
Please accept this cup.
Wow, that's great piece
of improvisation.
Can I take a photograph of that?
-Why not?
Okay, you want more height?
You need more height.
-Yes...yes.
Come on, show your skills
on the computer.
Thank you!
Wow! Beautiful! -Lights off.
It’s nice.
Where is the bathroom?
-This side.
What do you want me to do?
Rs. 910 is a good salary.
That's why I’m telling you to increase
the salary by Rs. 100.
They'll keep quiet for the
next 2 years.
If we keep on revising their pay...
In the future, our grandchildren
won't remain rich.
They'll become workers.
l mean to say that if we don't increase
their salaries, they'll strike work.
What can they do? We'll announce the
lock out ahead of them.
But, that's our arrow of
supernatural strength.
We've to keep it a secret.
Will Govt. let us announce lock out?
They'll support only workers.
No Mudaliar, they'll pretend as
if they're supporting them.
Who's offering them foreign exchange?
It’s us, isn't it?
Do workers give them?
Can you guarantee us that Govt.
will not create any problem?
Why not?
We can go in for a one time settlement
with the politicians.
But, we can't manage them
with monthly doles.
Government will declare
this strike as illegal.
l stand guarantee for that.
Till I’m gone, workers' salary will
remain Rs. 910 only.
I’ll not raise even a penny.
Even you people shouldn't raise it.
What's the noise there?
Nothing. Your daughter is hosting
a party for artists downstairs.
Somebody amongst them would've
raised the noise.
What's the noise?
Since all doors are alike.
So, I’m stepping in and out of every room,
searching bathroom.
You could've asked me, couldn't you?
Go straight.
No please, I’ve found it.
Thank you!
Nice books.
Have you read all the books?
Did you think, is it just
for decoration?
l may look stupid, but I’m not.
No, I didn't mean like that.
I’m terribly sorry.
I want to tell you something
but I don't know how to begin.
Can't you help me?
How can I help you without
knowing what it is?
I’m going to say ''sorry''.
But I've never had to say it before.
Oh! What for?
-For everything.
For what happened that day on
the street and what happened today here.
Sorry.
If I don't say sorry at least once,
I can't remain in peace.
But you've apologized many times now.
You must do me a favor.
Tell me. -Not just one, but two.
First, you have to step into my studio.
What's this like legendary Ahalya?
Where's your studio?
Here...Please come.
This is my studio.
I’ve stepped in.
Favor number two.
You must paint a portrait for me.
Not on the computer but
on canvas.
Anything which recently attracted
or touched you.
Even a sketch will do.
Please...
I’m not a girl who doesn't
respect artists.
It's true that I am rich girl. 
But please don't think I am proud.
I’m not like my father.
I’m more like my mother.
Comrade, sorry.
I must go back home only
after dropping you.
It’s raining...and the roads
are uneven, as you know.
As it is, I have a two-wheeler.
I’ll come now.
-I’ll wait downstairs.
Yeah... yeah...
Good night.
What about the wish?
Good night.
Nothing wrong in this.
We can send a weakling to spoil
the plan of mighty.
For the welfare of many workers...
What's wrong in this, Comrade?
My opinion says it's wrong.
We're now discussing about how to
manage the lock out problem.
So, we'll think about a way out.
Instead of doing that, it isn't our duty
to play tricks like a jackal.
Let's live like lions, Comrade.
What's wrong in dealing with it
wisely, Comrade?
I’m not a politician to do
anything in the guise of being smart.
Hello, oh God, wrong number!
Hang up the phone.
It’s wrong number, Comrade.
-Even, I’m saying that.
Bala is an honest girl. I’ll not let
you people use her as a means.
Oh! Is that so? Reached that far?
-Why do you also talk like that?
There's no limit for Anbu(affection).

No...this seems like another 2
syllable word(love).
Hey...don't!
We need to talk about funds
for the street play festival.
Let's discuss that.
An idea! Shall we ask any soft drink
company to sponsor us?
Very nice! Then, why do
you hold red flags?
You could hold the white flags.
Why keep talking about expenses?
They're not going to ask for
a 5 star hotel comforts?
Why would they?
If Nalla says so, they'll have a few
idlis and and sleep on the Verandah.
Okay, Verandah is ready.
We can't even afford those idlis.
Look, there may be about 200 people.
If we arrange basic amenities...
...how much will it cost?
-Will it cost Rs. 18,000?
I asked whether it will cost Rs. 18,000?
When did you come, slipping in quietly
like a cat....
Beg your pardon.
No, no, I’m sorry.
When did you come?
When you certified that Bala
is an honest girl.
Mr.Poun said it isn't Anbu(affection) but
it denotes a different meaning(Love).
I walked in at that time itself...
Okay, forget it.
That's our personal matter.
Is Rs. 18,000 enough for you?
-What for?
For your street play festival.
Look, you asked for a
cola sponsor.
Bala sponsor is here.
No, its Nalla sponsored. -How?
This is your money.
The dining table painting which you
painted in my house that day.
I sold it on the Internet.
Greetings.
Indian Food company bought that for
Rs. 20,000 to use it in their promos.
Really? -I know, you'll raise
such questions?
That's why, I’ve brought all this.
What's this?
-Receipt.
Sold for 20,000...
You said that, you'll pay us Rs. 18,000.
But, there's a shortfall of Rs. 2000.
Oh! This is a business deal.
Don't I need a commission of 10%  ?
Business man's daughter, right?
Did I lie?
Okay, forget it man...
Only Rs. 2000 shortfall.
But, we're getting Rs. 18,000. We'll add
color to our drama function.
Rs.18,000 is just an advance.
You can earn more than this.
lsn't it a great thing to grab money
from here itself for worker's welfare?
Whatever your father has grabbed
from the workers....
...is shinning bright here.
Logically, I shouldn't have come here.
Have you started to harp
on the same string?
Good morning, madam.
Just nod yes to everything my
father says.
What's the point in enacting street
dramas if all I had to say was "yes."
I could've remained as his slave
accepting Rs.910 salary.
Oh! Is talking truth a taboo here?
Don't talk till we get the money.
We're getting money
for a good cause.

Artists shouldn't be sold,
but art can be sold, okay?
Visitors to my office should look at
your portrait and be charmed by it.
Who should get charmed?
Comedy... don't add such comical streak
to the portrait.
I’ll ensure it. Which style
would you prefer?
It’s up to baby to decide.
What do I know about art?
I know only about heart.
Since it's very pure,
I keep my workers here.
Use your own inspiration and
paint it well.
But one thing.
The viewers shouldn't easily understand
the subject of your painting.
Why?
They should understand only
when explained.
That's modern art, am I right?
Sometimes I do crack jokes.
Don't take it seriously.
Have they come?
They're waiting for about
10 minutes for you.
Oh Lord Siva!
Why don't we paint Siva here?
It’ll look beautiful, won't it?
Do you mean Lord Siva?
Won't it look like a temple then?
When we say our profession is God.
Then, office is a temple, right? Let it be.
lf you tell me, when am l
to start working....
l don't want it to be done during
office working hours.
Boss, one thing. Tomorrow's Saturday,
followed by Sunday.
Then, Festival Holidays...
Holidays for 5-6 days.
You can start tomorrow then.
Don't switch on the AC during holidays
as he's working here.
5 plants will be running wastefully.
You'll get cool sea breeze
if you open the doors.
Even paint will get dried up
quickly, right?
It’ll be correct if
we start now. -Yes.
Okay, Bye. Hail Lord Siva!
Good.
Come.
Poovaasam Purappadum Penne

Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu
Oh maiden! You spread the fragrance
of flower when I draw a flower.
Oh Love! Even my fingers feel the
warmth of fire when I draw it.
lf non-living things
can come alive.
What'll happen to me?
You're the portrait
that's killing me.
When dots join, it'll
become a painting.
When hearts meet,
it's an epic poem.
Lives are also a
part of the portrait.
Even quarrel is also
a part of love.
Azure is needed to paint the sky.
Which color is needed
to paint our love?
With my blood and with the
brush like finger.
Let's paint our love, come...
Where do you find love
in a girl's body?
It’s in the eyes of the
person looking.
Where do you find love in
a girl's body?
It’s in the part,
never touched by a man.
You're an expert artist.
You're an expert in flattering girls.
Like the rain drops which touches
the ground deceiving the clouds.
You fall on me, come..
Very clever.
Look, he mingled communism
in the corporate office.
Okay, why did you choose to do that?
lf they insist on both Siva
and the ball bearing.
Then, we've to add dolly.
Look, 910 looks very beautiful
in the falls.
It’s seen clearly, right?
Won't we know?
Sickle above the head.
Karl Marx on the side.
100 marks can be given for that.
That painter painted as
my daughter had told.
l never interfered,
she's very clever.
Be quiet, father. -Very humble!
Then, that is...
Boss, he is a fraud.
-What do you mean?
Please come with me...
Leave me...
Look there, what's falling
down from the falls?
Water.
It’s flowing like 910.
Yes.
Salary which we pay the workers.
He's ridiculing us.
Look there, can you see Karl Marx?
Look at the top of Siva's head.
Sickle and the hammer.
Okay, leave it.
Look at Lord Siva.
Can you recognize who that is?
-It’s him.
l couldn't understand it myself,
how could you?
When I looked at that
painting intently.
No boss, I overheard when he was
talking to his friends.
It was wrong to let in that
arrogant man.
Yes, our workers came to know about
lock out from him only.
He was responsible for
the strike notice.
I thought, that you would
know everything.
Thinking that he's going to
be your future son-in-law.
Son-in-law? What do you mean?
Don't you know about this?
Okay then, forget it.
How can I forget it?
What're you saying?
Not me but the entire
office is agog.
Love between them crossed the limits
during the painting.
You had even asked to switch
off the A.C. plant.
It got pretty hot.
Boss, look there....
You can see it yourself...
Did you see?
We had asked him to paint on the wall
but he has flattered your daughter.
Boss, we shouldn't leave
it so easily.
We've to nip it at the bud.
Or else, we'll lose honor
in front of workers.
Sir, he has come....
even Madam is with him.
Come.
