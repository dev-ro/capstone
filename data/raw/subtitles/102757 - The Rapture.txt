What about them?
No. He's wearing a rug,
and she has a nose job.
Not a bad nose job.
They're all bad.
Let's go to
the Continental Club.
Really?
Come on, Vic. You don't want
to go back to the airport.
I like the airport.
I like the bars
at the airport hotels.
I like tourists.
I don't want that tonight.
What's the matter?
You scared of getting dirty?
Maybe.
Come on, Vic.
It's a place to start.
Let's have some fun.
I like them.
You would.
I'm Vic.
I'm Sharon.
Hi.
What brings you
to this side of town?
We got tired
of shooting the dogs...
where the rich people live.
What are you looking for now?
Now we're looking for something
a little less obvious.
But fun, definitely fun.
We're very social people.
You might be asking
for something you can't handle.
I can handle it.
What if things
go out of control?
What's control
got to do with it?
I think he wants to find out
if you have any limits.
Tell him I haven't
found them yet.
Sharon hasn't
found her limits yet.
Talk, talk, talk.
Let's go somewhere.
I have a store.
Let's go to the store.
Come here.
Come here and have a seat.
Come on.
I'll show you around.
Ooh.
What a man.
Nice store you got here, Vic.
Nice.
Come on.
Show me what you mean by fun.
No, Vic likes to watch.
Watch this.
Was that far enough?
Randy, right?
Oh, you remembered my name.
Hi, Randy.
Was it enough?
That was...
interesting.
This is operator 134.
What city, please?
Is that a business or residence?
Hold for the number.
This is operator 134.
What city?
Can you spell that?
Is that "d" as in dick?
Please hold for the number.
Hi, Wayne.
Quite strong last night,
wasn't it?
By a factor of five.
It was almost
like the first time.
I mean, it was that clear.
And the horn.
The sound of the horn,
that was new.
One note, a very clear tone.
I found it on my piano.
It's a B-flat.
What do you think?
I think it's going to happen,
and soon.
Have you been praying?
Yeah, as much as I can.
Shh.
What does the boy say?
Not yet.
Tell me a story.
No, no, no. I already
know that story.
Tell me something new.
I've done things for money.
Like what?
Things I wish I hadn't.
Like what?
I killed a man once.
For how much?
For a thousand dollars.
It's not very much money.
It was a lot then.
All I can say now
is I wish I hadn't.
Why?
'Cause it stays with me.
I mean, I killed a man.
I took his life.
His only life. That's bad.
Did you know him?
No.
Well, why did the people
that paid you want him dead?
There are some questions
you just don't ask.
After that, they offered
me another job, though.
Same kind of job, better money.
Did you do it?
No.
But I think about
that killing a lot...
I think, you know...
if we weren't taught
that killing is bad...
would I still feel this bad?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Are you scared of me now?
Did anyone pay you to kill me?
That was not a good year.
1975, that was my best year.
I was nineteen.
Hmm? What was your best year?
I guess I'm still waiting.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Everything just seems so...
empty.
Time passes so quickly.
Yeah? I think
it's kind of slow.
No, I mean--I mean
like a day, you know?
A day is always just over.
I don't know
what I'm trying to say.
No, I think I understand.
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.
Ha. Why don't you
let me in on my secret?
I think you're depressed...
and I think you
should see a therapist.
Oh, that's great.
That's fucking brilliant.
You understand that
these are the last days.
You can't go on like this.
God is coming back.
His prophecies are
now being fulfilled.
You have to accept Jesus
as your Lord and Savior.
Otherwise?
You won't be saved.
We're not trying to scare you.
No.
Do you understand the difference
between righteousness and faith?
Why don't you tell me?
It's only by the grace
of God you'll be saved.
Well, what if I lead
a good life?
Does it still matter
if I don't believe?
Do you really lead a good life?
No.
You have to believe.
If you don't...
you go to hell.
Well, that doesn't seem fair.
I used to think that,
but then I met Him.
Who?
That's what we're
trying to tell you.
"For God so loved the world,
He gave His only begotten son...
"that whosoever
believeth in His name...
"should not perish,
but have everlasting life."
You can have what we have.
A personal relationship
with the Son of God.
It's hard to believe
unless you believe...
but when you believe it,
then it's easy.
You just know.
What?
Him.
How?
Who knows? It just is.
Right. And I'm
supposed to buy this?
No.
It's a gift.
We know what you're thinking.
Doesn't make sense.
No.
I was like you.
I doubt it.
No, really.
Like I said, I doubt it.
I heard someone
talking about the boy.
Who's the boy?
Some people say
that he's a prophet...
in the old tradition.
Some people say
there's others like him...
all around the country.
All around the world.
And what do you say?
I say trust in God.
Excuse me.
Operator 134.
What city, please?
City, please?
Please hold for the number.
Operator 1 34.
What city, please?
Is that a business or residence?
Hello.
Sharon.
Hi, Vic.
I dropped by a few of the hotels
near the airport today.
You'll never guess who I found.
The most fascinating
couple, really.
They're from Philadelphia.
Well, he's from Pennsylvania,
but she's from Florida...
and they're married.
Isn't that romantic?
What time?
Pick you up at 9:00.
Here's to open-minded people...
in L.A...
my kind of town.
Honey, don't you have
something better to do?
I'm doing it.
Oh, you.
You again?
Again.
What is that?
What are you talking about?
She has a tattoo on her back.
Wow.
Got it when I was a kid.
This was before she met me.
Just--Just got drunk one night.
One night?
You had it done in one night?
Well, you know how kids are.
I almost got a tattoo once.
She was drunk.
Angie, you got that
in one night?
Sharon, she doesn't
want to talk about it.
There's nothing to talk about.
Why did you get it?
Sharon, can we
talk about it later?
I mean,
it must have been painful.
I don't remember,
and I don't know why I got it.
It's OK, Angie.
I'm here. I'm with you.
Why would you get a tattoo
that you didn't really want?
I'm sorry.
I don't mean
to make you unhappy...
but I really need to know.
Why?
I don't know.
I don't know,
but it's important.
What is it?
Don't you know what's going on?
What?
The dream.
The pearl.
What dream?
Tell them.
Think about it.
That would be a miracle.
Hi.
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?
How are you?
We're fine. And you?
I'm fine, now that I dream
about the pearl.
What dream would that be?
The pearl.
I dream about the pearl.
Tell us about it.
What's it look like?
Well, you know.
The pearl. It's...
It's a big pearl by a river.
No, it's not.
You haven't seen it.
Yes, I have.
You can't fake it.
Well, it's a message from God.
If you really want it,
all you have to do is pray.
Pray?
He's coming back.
Slow down.
If everybody's
getting this dream...
how come it isn't
on the news?
Those who need to know know.
And those that don't believe
won't get the dream.
There are five billion people
on the planet.
There's I don't know
how many religions.
Why does the God of some little
country on the Mediterranean...
have to be the God for everyone?
Isn't that a little arrogant?
I mean, really.
The Buddhists get along OK
without Jesus Christ.
The Hindus get along OK
without Jesus Christ.
The Muslims seem
to be getting along OK...
without Jesus Christ.
But none of them are saved.
Sharon, this is
my friend Andrea.
Andrea's from Nebraska.
Come and join.
Get up.
What?
Get up or get out.
Ohh. What'd I do?
I have to make the bed.
Look, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Get out of bed
or get out of the house.
Why?
This bed is unclean.
No, no.
Unclean?
You changed the sheets
yesterday.
Shut up!
I'm starting over, Randy.
I've had enough.
Enough what?
I need a new direction
in my life.
There is a God. I know it.
There is a God,
and I'm going to meet Him.
When did you get religion?
I am trying, Randy.
I want my salvation.
Sharon, you're fine
the way you are.
You just want to live
in sin, don't you?
Yeah, that's right.
I just want to live in sin.
Fine. Be a slave
to the devil.
Devil? You remember
where we met?
Don't start asking
me now to apologize...
for who I am or
what I believe in.
Oh, and what do you believe in?
There is no God.
There's only chaos.
Why do we have
such guilty consciences?
Answer that.
You're the one
with the guilty conscience.
I sleep really well.
At least I used to.
Ow. Jesus Christ, that's hot.
Don't take the Lord's name
in vain, Randy.
That's one
of the commandments...
and it comes before
theft and adultery.
It even comes before murder.
That's how important it is...
not to take
the Lord's name in vain.
Yeah? Since when
have you known the Lord?
I am trying to.
But what does a shower
at 3:00 in the morning...
have to do
with eternal salvation?
I want to be clean.
Am I clean?
Yeah, you're clean.
When we do something wrong...
we feel bad...
and that's because there's
a little bit of God...
inside of all of us
telling it's time to...
change our ways
before it's too late.
Isn't that right?
No, that's not right.
It's just conditioned
by society.
All we are is animals...
whose brains have become
too big and too complicated...
for the purposes of
satisfying our animal needs...
which are food and sex.
There's a spiritual need
just as real as hunger...
just as real
as the need for love.
Sharon, don't you understand
what's going on?
The world's a disaster...
we have no power
to make it better.
You hate your job...
you hate your life...
but you want to feel special.
And instead of letting
me do that...
you're rushing off to something
that's not even there.
Mary, you need
to get the hell outta here!
There's no...pearl.
There's only us.
I feel sorry for you, Randy.
I really do.
But you have to leave.
I don't want to leave.
I want to stay here with you.
You know me.
We know each other.
We know each other's secrets.
That's something.
I think
we can love each other...
and I think you feel that, too.
There has to be something more.
Why?
I'm tired of the pain
in my life.
I'm tired of feeling
empty all the time.
Let me help you.
Why can't we let God
help both of us?
Because there is no God.
God, please.
Please, please help me.
God, I'm lost.
Chicks don't
usually stop for me.
I think they think
I'm dangerous.
They're probably right.
I'm not as dangerous
as some guys are I know.
But I would never
give me a lift...
that's for sure. No way.
If I was a chick...
no double-fucking way
would I give me a lift.
I've looked in the mirror.
I've seen myself. I mean...
with my thumb out...
and I was a chick
and I saw me, no, sir.
Now, on the other hand,
if I was, uh--
If I was the one who was
hitching, I was a chick...
I'd stop for me in a second.
In fact l'd--
l'd--I'd fuck me, too.
In fact, if I was hitching
and I was a chick...
and I got stopped by a chick,
I'd fuck me that way, too.
Yeah. In fact,
I wouldn't mind...
getting into a bi-girl
scene with myself.
Actually, you're the first chick
that's ever given me a lift.
I don't think
other chicks pick me up...
'cause they can tell
I carry a gun...
and I've been to prison
in Vermont.
I--I don't think that's...
where they can tell
I've been to prison...
but that's where
I'm from--Vermont.
You ever been to Vermont?
I'm from
the Lemonfaire Valley.
Actually, there's
no lemons in Vermont.
Actually comes
from the French--
Les Monts Verts...
which means
the Green Mountains...
which is what Vermont
means--green mountains.
Ver--green, mont--mountains.
Vermont--Green Mountains.
Anyway...
my father's a farmer.
I left home.
What's your name? I'm Tommy.
Sharon.
Oh, yeah? With who?
What?
Who you sharin' it with?
You gonna share it with me?
Sharon...
you know that
the state bird of Vermont...
is the hermit thrush?
Bet you didn't know that.
State flower is the red clover.
Highest point is
Mount Mansfield, I believe...
which is 4,393--something.
I don't know.
Hey, you got a quarter?
Get some Magic Fingers
going in here.
How'd that be?
It's time for you to go, Tommy.
Huh?
You have to go now.
And you have to
leave me your gun.
Can I get dressed?
Where were you?
Turn around.
Really?
Come on.
Where have you been?
I went away for a few days.
Who'd you go with?
No one.
Meet anyone?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
I did meet someone.
You're OK?
I'm fine, Vic.
I'm really, really fine.
No, you're not.
Something's going on.
You've changed.
You've got this look right now.
What look?
The goofy smile.
If I tell you, you're
not going to believe me...
but I have to tell you...
so it really doesn't matter
if you don't believe me.
It doesn't matter to me.
I mean, it matters to me...
but you're the one who
really needs to hear this now.
You met a guy.
Well, "guy" is not exactly
the word I'd use for him.
You fox.
You fell in love.
Yes.
Wait till he
finds out about you.
Oh, He knows all about me.
Is he as bad a boy
as I am?
I think you should meet Him.
You told him about me?
I told you--
He knows everything.
He's rich, right?
He's some rich guy...
and you fell for
some line of his.
You could love Him, too.
You fell for some
rich homosexual.
He's the Lord
Jesus Christ, Vic.
He's the Son of God.
Sharon...
you quit your job?
Why would I do that?
To go to the airport...
sell flowers...
do whatever the cult
wants you to do.
You can't understand...
but l--I know
what that's like.
Until it happens to you...
and until you accept
God into your heart...
it's like a fairy tale.
It's like some joke
that you just don't get.
I think you need
to be deprogrammed.
There is no cult, Vic.
There's only God
and his message of love.
Love?
Love.
Look, you'll
give this up someday.
I know you.
You'll give this up.
This is forever.
Everybody says that.
This is different.
Everybody says that, too.
Sharon, call me
when this is over.
Hold for the number.
Hi. Who's this?
Hi, Susanna. This is Sharon.
Have you met Jesus?
Oh, I'm sure
you're in a hurry...
but don't you think
you could take time out...
to get to know
your Lord and Savior?
Well, OK, you have
a nice day, too.
Oh, what was
the number you wanted?
Here you go.
Hi, this is Sharon.
Who's this?
Hi, Maria.
Have you met God?
You have.
Isn't he wonderful?
You're supposed to spend...
a maximum of fifteen seconds
on each call.
Do you know what
your average has been?
No.
Take a guess.
Twenty seconds? Twenty-five?
Two minutes.
You were clocked on one call
at seven minutes fifteen.
I am just trying
to do my job.
It seems like you're trying
to do two jobs out there.
We only have one job.
That's right,
and you're not doing...
the one that you're
being paid for.
Henry...
God made me an information
operator for a reason.
I'm in a position
to spread His word...
to hundreds
of people every day...
personally...
one-to-one.
God?
I know you can't believe this...
but God is coming back
to judge the world...
and it's important.
I have to tell people.
We have to prepare
for His return.
When did you first
see the light?
A few days ago.
You don't believe me.
Sometimes people have
heard about the pearl...
and they try to pretend
like they've seen it...
but you can always tell
when they're lying.
You just can't fake it.
You?
When they first meet Him...
everyone thinks
that judgment day...
is just around the corner.
I remember
that feeling very well.
It's a powerful feeling.
But that sense that it's going
to happen tomorrow passes...
when tomorrow comes
and He doesn't...
and then you understand
that those feelings...
as powerful as they are...
and the dreams,
as real as they are...
are still just shadows
of the real thing...
and no one can say...
how far away that
real thing really is.
But the feeling
is so strong.
I don't know you,
but I know you.
A lot of people who have come
to God have been broken.
They've been messed up by life.
The unbelievers
try to make it seem...
Iike there's something
wrong with us...
that we're stupid.
But only the humble
hear the voice of God.
You're alone, aren't you?
It's hard at the beginning.
You give up your whole life...
just like you've come
to a new country.
Your old friends cannot
really be your friends anymore.
What do I do?
Trust in God.
And take it easy on the phones.
Who's the boy?
God is coming back...
and there are wars
and rumors of wars...
and a curse devours the earth...
and those who live in it
are held guilty.
God is coming back.
There are wars
and rumors of wars...
and a curse devours the earth...
and those who live in it
are held guilty.
We have to wait.
We have to wait.
For how long?
Probably a few years--
five years, six years.
Probably a few years.
Five years, six years.
Hi, Randy.
Oh, uh...
Sharon, right? Sharon.
How's that apartment coming?
Is it still unclean?
No.
So you found your salvation.
Congratulations.
I found God.
Oh, yeah?
Is he gonna move in, or did he
keep his own place...
or you gonna do
that commuting thing?
You got to watch that.
It's very tough
on a relationship.
Why are you here?
I know you're as lost
as I was, Randy...
and I wanted to tell you
that you could know God.
If you just surrender
your pride, you can know God.
Sharon, it's just a drug.
You're in pain.
Instead of doing heroin,
you're doing God...
and I need sandpaper.
Randy, God is real.
God is not make-believe,
and you know that.
You don't want to admit it
because you're afraid.
What am I afraid of?
What we're all afraid of--
God's judgment.
No.
I'm not.
I don't want to lose you.
You just want to save my soul.
At least you know
you have one.
I don't want to tell
my secrets in church.
I'll pray for both of us.
You'd stay with me
even if I didn't pray?
So far we're still in the realm
of signs and wonders...
but the Rapture is coming.
It says so in the Bible.
Our bodies will be
transformed into spirit...
and then we'll be called up
in the clouds to meet God.
The end is coming soon.
This year.
Ever since I was a kid,
I had this feeling...
that something was
going to happen to me.
I always knew that
when it happened...
that I'd recognize it.
I wouldn't mistake it
for something else.
I wouldn't have
something happen to me...
and say this is it...
and later on say,
"Nah, that wasn't it."
It was a secret feeling...
and I never told
anybody about it.
What's the feeling now?
Something's gonna happen.
Where's heaven?
It's in the sky.
Why can't we see it?
You will.
But why can't we see it now?
Mary?
Do you love Baby Jesus?
Yes.
Well, then you'll
see him real soon.
What does the Bible say?
We who are alive,
who are saved...
will be taken
bodily into heaven.
Oh, Sharon, Sharon!
You just can't
accept God, can you?
Nope.
Well, maybe we should talk
about that for a minute.
OK. So do you mean that
if you're a Christian...
and you were ironing
your shirts...
and the Rapture happens,
you get taken up to heaven...
in the middle of
doing your laundry?
Well, does God
give you time...
to turn off the iron,
or do your shirts burn?
I wear permanent press.
Well, I mean, what's
supposed to happen?
You're supposed to
float up into the sky?
In the twinkling of an eye...
the body will be
transformed into spirit.
And there is a warning.
If you listen,
if you pray for it...
there's going to be
a warning.
We'll hear the sound of
trumpets, God's angels.
Louis...
Louis...
I'm trying to say this...
without causing you
a lot of pain.
Any way you say it,
I'm fired, right?
We have struggled together...
but you have to admit,
it hasn't worked out.
It's 'cause I'm not kissing ass
around here, isn't it?
Louis, it's because
you're not doing your job.
You're not doing
your job, bananahead.
Louis...
we tried to get you help.
I don't want your fucking help!
We took you to a counselor.
You took me to a homo!
I took you to an AA meeting.
They're a bunch of a-holes.
A-holes, the lot of them!
And you're an a-hole.
And I'm tired of kissing
your Christian a-hole!
What are you looking at?!
Louis, I'll pray for you.
Oh, fuck you!
Get down!
OK. OK...
Louis...
No speeches, preacher.
I have a little girl.
So what?
Come in.
You see, now's
one of those times...
when I wish I was a believer.
Why?
'Cause I would have
a rock to stand on.
'Cause I could tell myself
everything was for the better...
because God has a plan.
But it is...because He does.
Oh, it is so hard
for me, Sharon.
I try to resist it
as much as possible.
So you do feel something
tugging at you, don't you?
I tell myself
it's just conditioning...
it's how I was raised.
I tell myself if we didn't
tell our children about God...
they wouldn't ask.
It is a story we tell ourselves
so everything makes sense.
It's not.
How do you know?
The Bible.
Don't tell me "The Bible."
It's a question of faith.
So there's no proof?
Paula, the universe you live in
is a cold and empty place.
The universe I live in
is filled with God.
Will we see Daddy again?
Yes.
When we die?
Or when God
takes us to heaven.
When the Rapture comes,
does that mean we die?
Not exactly.
So...
you can go to heaven
without dying?
Yeah.
But...if you die...
then you can still
go to heaven?
Yeah.
So Daddy is going to heaven.
No. Daddy's already in heaven.
If we pray to Daddy,
can he hear us?
Well, we pray to God...
and God tells Daddy
what we're saying.
That way he can hear
everything.
OK?
This is from
the book of "Revelations..."
chapter twelve, verse six.
It says...
"And the woman fled
into the desert...
"where she had a place
prepared for her by God."
Is anyone else
getting visions...
that tells us we have to
go to the desert?
You don't believe me.
I do.
What does it mean?
You're the only one
who can hear these calls.
It could be Satan.
I don't think so.
Then God wants you
for a special purpose.
Please come with me.
We haven't been invited.
But I'm scared.
Don't ask God
to meet you halfway.
What does that mean?
Sharon, you can't just
leave like this.
Yes, I can.
God is calling me.
No, no. No, Sharon.
What about Mary?
God is calling her, too.
Why don't you sell the house?
You can't
just walk away from it.
Of course I can.
There's a better house
waiting for me.
God is building me
a mansion right now.
What should I wear?
God won't come,
the bank will own your home...
and what are you
going to do then?
I'm going to heaven.
Mary and I are
going to heaven...
and we'll be wearing
these dresses together...
when we finally see God.
Randy always loved this dress.
I'll wear it for him.
I'm going to be
seeing him soon.
And he always loved
to see Mary in this.
Don't you get
white robes and wings?
Angels don't have wings.
I don't know about the robes.
I don't know what they wear.
I guess I'll find out.
So then what's the sweater for?
It gets cold
in the desert at night.
Winter is coming.
You're going to need
more than a sweater.
He's taking us soon.
Very soon.
How do you know?
He told me.
Sharon...
Sharon, listen to me.
I don't know
if you can hear me...
but listen to me.
You need food.
Not that much.
You need a tent.
I don't want you guys
sleeping out in the car, OK?
Candles...matches...
flashlight.
Thank you, Paula.
You need something else.
You can't go out
to the desert alone.
There are a lot of creeps
out there, Sharon...
and a woman alone--
I'm scared.
God will take care of us.
Maybe.
Insurance.
Oh, Paula, no.
You don't have to use it,
but you have to take it.
And you can bring it back
to me when you come home.
I'm not coming home.
Mom?
Yes, Mary?
This doesn't look
like heaven, Mom.
This isn't heaven, honey.
Then why stop here?
Think of heaven
as a great big hotel...
or a big office building.
Yeah?
Well, this is the lobby.
This is where we have to wait.
For what?
The elevator.
This is it.
Come on. Everybody out.
Are you waiting
for God, too?
Oh, is that what you guys
are doing here?
God is coming back.
Sounds good.
He really is.
OK.
He's coming tomorrow.
No. Soon, Mary.
He's coming soon.
That's it, Mary!
That's it!
Come on, he's calling us.
Let's hurry.
Come on, Mary.
No, my panda!
Come on...go.
I--I miss my daddy.
Honey, I miss your daddy, too.
I wanna see him again.
You will. You will
see him in heaven.
Why can't we go
to heaven, Mommy?
I wanna go to heaven.
We have to wait
until God calls us.
Did God call Daddy?
When you die,
is that when God calls you?
Yeah.
Then I wanna die.
Oh, sweetie, no.
You wanna go to heaven,
don't you?
Yes.
And you believe...
that when we die,
we'll go to heaven...
because we're saved, right?
Yes.
Then why can't we just die
and go there really quickly...
and be with Daddy again?
Why do we have
to stay here...
and hang around
and wait for God?
Come on, Mom...
Iet's die.
Let's give God one more chance.
Howdy.
Hello.
I'm Foster Madison.
Sharon and Mary.
Oh, yeah?
I have a little sister
named Mary.
She's all grown up now.
Are you with God?
No. I'm with the sheriff.
We're waiting for our Father.
Where's he?
Heaven.
Don't you go to school?
I don't have to go to school.
I'm not asking
you to understand...
or to have faith, but...
the end of the world
is coming, and...
we're a lot safer out here.
Well, there's a two-week limit
on staying here.
Is that a limit on how long
I can stay in the park...
or just this
particular campsite?
Actually, it's just a limit
on how long you can use...
this particular campsite.
OK, so if I move over there...
or over there or over there...
I can stay another two weeks?
Technically, I can't stop you.
Thank you.
Could I ask you a question?
Sure.
Is this good
for your little girl?
Have you been saved?
No.
Do you know what that means?
Yeah.
Would you like to be?
Oh, yeah, yeah...
Sure. Who wouldn't?
Why is it so hard
for you to pray?
Well, you have to surrender
to God, don't you?
That's right.
It's in my training--
I don't give up my gun.
But...you'd like to believe.
That these are the last days?
You know they are.
God is coming back
to judge the world.
A lot of people
are gonna suffer.
You know, I hope
that's not true...
but if it is, and there's
no law against it...
my hands are tied.
I bet with a little prayer...
you'd be on my side
in an hour.
Well, then it's time
for me to go.
Watch out for the coyotes.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Mom?
Mommy?
What?
Mom...I'm hungry.
You said we'd give
Him one more chance.
-Who?
-God.
You said we'd give God
one more chance.
And if we didn't get
the Rapture...
that we could die.
That's what you said.
You promised.
Baby...
Don't you believe in God?
Yes.
Don't you love God?
Then why can't we
just go to God?
Go now. Now.
One more chance.
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought you'd stop by
for a cup of sugar?
No. Actually,
I brought you this.
We have sleeping bags.
Yeah, I know.
It's just, sometimes,
you wanna sit on the ground...
you don't wanna get dirty,
it's nice to have a blanket.
Thank you.
I, uh--I also brought
your little girl--
It's just a candy bar.
I know that moms
are worried about cavities...
so if you don't
wanna give it to her...
you know, I'll understand.
I'll give it to her.
You can share it.
Thanks.
Well...
I'll check up on you again
sometime if that's OK.
Thank you.
Mom, you have to make up
your mind now!
Gabriel's coming, Mom!
Gabriel's coming!
It's God, Mom! It's God!
Don't ask God
to meet you halfway!
Mommy!
Mary...Mary, wake up.
It's OK, honey.
It's OK.
Oh, baby, you're just hungry.
We'll get something to eat.
We'll go to town.
No. We can't leave.
Yes, we can.
But we don't need any food.
God will give us food
when we get to heaven.
We'll be in heaven tonight.
There was a river,
and I was in heaven.
Where was l?
You were there.
Good.
Sort of.
You were there,
but only sort of.
It's almost morning.
Soon as the sun comes up,
we'll get something to eat.
$5.65, please.
Oh, no, you don't.
Call the police.
-No.
-Why not?
She had a kid.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Do you love Jesus?
Yes.
You know, in heaven...
there's Jesus and
Baby Jesus together...
and Baby Jesus has
the special job of...
He has the special job...
of looking out
for all the children.
Mary, do you love Baby Jesus?
Yes.
It's not fair to make you pay
because I'm lost.
If God loves us,
He'll understand.
We're going to heaven now.
We're going...together?
Together.
And Daddy? Daddy's in heaven?
Daddy...We'll see Daddy, yes...
and we'll be together forever...
because nothing
is broken in heaven.
I love you.
Daddy...
You have to love God, Mary.
Do you love God?
Yes.
Tell him that.
Don't be afraid, baby.
Could you get out
of the car, please?
Well, what happened to God?
What's wrong?
I need to see your license
and your registration, please.
They're in the car.
Thank you.
Could you step over in--
In the light, please?
Sharon...
Here.
Where's your little girl?
She's with God.
She died?
Mary?
How?
I killed her.
I was gonna kill
myself, too, but...
you can't get into heaven
if you kill yourself.
You can get into heaven
if somebody else kills you...
but not if you kill yourself.
Life is some...
kind of punishment,
isn't it?
You have to
go through with it...
even when you know
what life is for.
What is life for?
Ask God.
And what does He say?
I think...
He says that, basically...
that you have to love Him
no matter what...
but I don't love Him!
Not anymore.
He has too many rules.
He told me to meet
Him in the desert...
and I did...
and I waited,
and He didn't come.
He broke His promise.
He let me kill my little girl...
and He still expects
me to love Him?
I'm afraid of hell,
so I have to wait out my life...
waiting for God.
Now...He'll forgive me,
and He'll let me join...
my daughter and
my husband in heaven...
but first, I have
to say I love Him.
You can send me
to the gas chamber...
and if I let God
into my heart...
before I die,
then I can go to heaven...
because God is merciful.
How fast was I going?
Hundred miles an hour.
Hundred miles an hour.
If I'd have gone
off a bridge and died...
would I have gone to heaven?
I don't know.
Neither do l.
I know you.
I should be embarrassed
to tell you where we met...
but I'm not ashamed.
I'm not ashamed
of anything anymore.
I found God.
God found me.
I was preaching
the word of God...
in a shopping mall
in Palm Springs...
and they had me kicked out.
So I went back in.
Then they had me arrested.
Have you heard
the word of God?
It's the greatest
gift of all time.
You have to trust
completely in God.
He'll forgive all your sins.
Who forgives God?
God is coming back, Mommy.
There are wars
and rumors of wars, Mommy...
and a curse
devours the earth...
and those who live in it
are held guilty.
He said He would
take us to heaven.
Mother, listen to me.
The living outnumber the dead.
The armies of the Lord...
are waiting
for the day of judgment.
Don't you still love God, Mommy?
He left us alone--
alone in the desert.
He let me kill you.
But do you still love Him?
How can I love a God
that let me kill my baby?
God loves you
because you love Him.
Why?
I know you want me back...
but I can't come back, Mommy.
I'm dead.
That's the first call!
It's Gabriel
blowing his trumpet!
There'll be six more calls!
You have until
the last call to repent!
After that it's too late!
There's the snap.
Hands off to Henderson.
Henderson's going
to the right side...
and he's tackled at
the fifteen yard line.
It's God!
He's giving us a last chance
to save ourselves.
That's War.
It's the first horseman
of the Apocalypse.
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born
in Bethlehem
What more do you need?
Get out of here.
What are you doing here?
I want to know
what happens next.
Are you scared?
I don't know.
I never had any faith.
But you did.
Yep.
So...
So.
Well, if the world
is coming to an end...
this isn't the place to be.
Now let's go.
No!
No, I don't want to go!
Don't let me go!
No!
Mom?
Hi, Mom.
Is this hell?
Hello, Mary?
Is that your daughter?
Mary, where are you?
I'm here.
Where are we?
You know when you hear
those songs...
about the river that
washes away all your sins?
Well, here it is.
We're in heaven.
Why are we in heaven?
We're not in heaven.
Heaven's over there.
I can't see it.
It's there.
If you love God, it's there.
Foster...
do you love God...
for giving you
the gift of life?
Yes.
No!
Mommy, Gabriel's coming.
You have to make up
your mind.
There's nothing more to say.
You have to love God.
I love you, Mary.
That isn't enough.
Baby, it's all I have.
If life is a gift...
if it really is a gift...
and there really is a heaven--
There really is a heaven.
Then why should I thank Him...
for the gift
of so much suffering, Mary?
So much pain on the earth
that He created?
Let me ask Him why.
Tell God you love Him!
I can't.
If you don't tell God
that you love Him...
you can't go to heaven.
Tell God that you love Him!
Mommy!
No.
Do you see heaven?
Yes.
Isn't it beautiful?
Yes.
Do you know how long
you have to stay here?
Yes.
How long?
Forever.
