FiVe! FiVe!
Greetings, sire.
- May you be happy
Please take a look at my grandson's
horoscope and predict his future
Certainly
Let me see your forehead
The lines on his forehead
make it so obVious...
that the fury of Jupiter, the Sun,
Mars and Saturn will rule his life
They will dominate his life totally!
Should he be proVoked by someone...
this boy will certainly
not spare him
What should we name him?
Sameer. A gust of cool breeze.
- Sameer...?
By nature, he's hot-headed.
The name will keep him calm
Come to me, come...
Guess what? Don't eVer make the
mistake of getting him married
There you are! He has kicked me!
As he grows up, he'll use his fists
and kicks more than his mouth!
l'm not sparing you!
l'm not sparing you! NeVer!
Sameer! Let him go! LeaVe him alone!
C'mon, Sameer! Come with me!
Sameer, why did you raise
your hand at the Principal?
When l lose my temper...
it feels as if a hundred guitars
are playing in my brains!
Now tell me something.
Why did you hit Chintu?
l was angry because he abused you!
Sameer, my mother says, anger
is loVe's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper,
can't control anything in his lifetime
Now stop being angry
and smile. Smile!
So you won't smile...? l'll set
your mood right in a moment
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- HaVe an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- HaVe dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
Sameer gets into a fight with
someone or the other eVery day...
and today, he raised his hands
on me! The Principal!
So much of anger is not good, Ma'am.
lt's Arun who always calms him down
He was born with the temper.
How will l explain...?
EVer since his parents haVe died, his
temper is getting worse and worse
l understand, ma'am.
And that is why l'm not throwing
him out of the school
But l'm really worried. lf this is
how Sameer Malhotra's childhood is...
how is his adolescence going to be?
So these three fractures
and the 36 stitches...
is it all your doing?
- Yes, sir. l'Ve thrashed them
But you must ask them why l hit them
There's this girl Sameer
wants to marry...
and these guys were treating her
like a ball in the basket!
ln 1998, you beat up a professor
in the college?
He didn't haVe any time
to teach the boys
But he used to call the girls home
all alone and gaVe them tuitions
He had eVil on his mind.
So l gaVe it to him!
What wrong did l do?
ln the year 2000, you rescued
a man who was drowning...
and gaVe him a beating?
- l was the one who saVed him too!
There was a board which said in
bold letters, Swimming is forbidden
Why did he go there? l gaVe it
to him... what wrong did l do?
Look, we haVe receiVed
eight complaints..
..against you in the last fiVe years
You might get more
lf l receiVe another complaint,
you're going straight to jail!
Roma...? You'Ve got married?
Don't be angry today. Please
don't hit someone
l'll...
- No, wait here
There's no saying when
he might hit someone
You think l'll hit you? Why?
How can l hit you?
l...
And l thought you...
Did you think l'd marry you?
- Yes
HaVe you eVer told me
that you loVe me? - No
And look at him. He's
so sweet, so gentle...
he loVes me so much. And you...
Now listen to me. No girl can
eVer fall in loVe with you
She can only be afraid of you.
- Why?
You haVe such a temper,
eVen l'm afraid of you
Remember how you thrashed those
boys at the basketball court, Sameer?
But they had made a mistake.
They had to be punished
EVery human being makes a mistake.
What if l had made a mistake?
You'd haVe hit me too, isn't
it? lsn't it true?
Let's go
Sameer, are you really going away?
- Yes, grandma
l'Ve got the job of a lifeguard
in Goa. lt's a nice job
Besides, l get into a lot
of fights here, grandma
lf l go to a new place and meet new
people, l might not get into fights
My son, think again before you go
The reason behind the
fights is your temper
Your temper will go with
you whereVer you go
Yes, brother. lf you leaVe, l'll
be worried about you all the time
You're the one l'll worry about.
l'Ve got to get you
educated and married
l'Ve got to haVe an operation
conducted on grandma's eyes...
and send her to grandpa
in heaVen at the earliest
l'm not going away in a hurry.
He'll haVe to wait!
But before you leaVe, you'll
haVe to promise me...
that you won't get into fights
and brawls with anyone
ls that clear, my son?
Grandma, l swear it on your head
l'll neVer lose my temper again
One, two...
is that your luggage, mister?
Also this bag?
Four...? Four bags?
Yes
Which is THE bag?
l mean, the bag in which you're
carrying the cash and Valuables...?
Terrible times, you see. You
could easily be robbed
Robberies are commonplace
in trains nowadays
Difficult to tell the bonafide
passenger from the thief!
Go to sleep. l'll stay awake.
- l'm not sleepy
Mister, this period between
3 and 5 in the morning...
is meant to be spent in slumber.
HoweVer strong a man is...
he does drift into it at least once
l want to see when you go to sleep.
- l told you, l'm not sleepy
All right. Actually,
l loVe my forty winks
l'm going to sleep
Yes, grandma, l'Ve reached
safely. Okay...
Thank you, mister.
- What for?
For looking after my luggage
l'll explain. l haVe a weakness.
l can't stay awake in the night
And l can't sleep in the train,
for fear of losing my luggage...
and that is why, l pulled
off the fast one
So that l could go to sleep and
you'd look after my luggage.
Nice idea, eh?
Know what ? You're a great guy
l think l must traVel with
you on my way back too
Here's my card. Phone me on this
number, l'll find you at the station
Help me, grandma!
Praise the Lord...
Lord, protect my grandson
whereVer he is
Lord, help Sameer find his loVe
Lord!
You...?
- Yes. l'm Raj. He's Paul
Our misfortune, we're
brothers. Twins
l'm an astrologer who predicts people's
future from their birthcharts...
and he ruins their future!
What does your brother do?
- He belongs to the Eagle gang...
Very dangerous people.
NeVer cross their path
NeVer. - You appear to
be a stranger in town
Whom are you Visiting?
- Mr Duggal
Mr Duggal!
- Yes, he has a Vacant room
Not just a room, his
brains are empty too
He used to be a police
inspector in Goa...
and has blood clotted in
his head eVer since..
..a thief struck him with a stick
WhereVer the clot stands,
that part becomes useless
He plays deaf, dumb and blind
Let's see what he's playing today
He's playing blind today
l don't belieVe this!
- You will, Very soon
That's Mr Duggal!
But he's looking at me.
- No, you're looking at him
Let me show you. Wait
Rascals! You hit me because
l'm blind today?
When l start seeing again, none of
you will be seen around here again!
Do you belieVe it now? Wait a moment
l'm glad you're here.
l haVen't had any tea
GiVe me half a litre of milk
ls the milk oVer, Bansi?
l'm not Bansi. l'm Sameer .
l'm sorry, l thought
you were the milkman
When did the headlights go off?
How does that concern you? You're
not a doctor, are you?
GiVe me the milk.
- But l'm not a milkman...
l'm Raj, the astrologer!
- The astrologer!
Such a big mouth!
- lt's not my mouth. lt's a bag
And here is your mouth!
- Let me be, please!
What brings you here...?
- l'm the one who came here
l'Ve landed a job at the beach resort.
Mr Sharma has had a word with you
For the room, isn't it? Come,
l'll take you to your room
l'll show you to your room
Go upstairs from here. Your
room is right ahead. Go on
There's no room there!
- No?
But l saw it last night. Did
it disappear oVernight?
Hello. - You're showing
him the wrong place
The room is oVer there!
- Where?
Here! Come with me.
- You're throwing me out...?
We're actually going in!
l'll check out the room later.
Let's talk about the rent first
l can pay you 2500 at the most.
- l'll collect at least 5000 rupees!
lt's okay if you agree.
Or you may leaVe...
Hey! lt's me!
- Why do you keep butting in?
GiVe him half the room for 2500. Find
another tenant for the other half
ls Bansi staying with you too?
- But l'm not Bansi!
Don't be angry. GiVe me
half a litre of milk
But l'm not the milkman! l'm
Raj... the astrologer!
So what are you doing here? Go
and look up people's horoscopes
Show Sameer the room.
Come, Sameer...
lt's me!
Where's Sameer?
- Here l am, sir
C'mon
For my grandma's eyesight
For my sister's education
For my sister's marriage
Lord, it's Your responsibility
to haVe an operation..
..conducted on grandma's eyes
My sister's education and her
marriage is also Your responsibility
Fill up the coffers at
the earliest, please
And okay, it's my responsibility to
make offerings to You at the temple
O beautiful one...
Come to me
Has Mr Duggal asked you to come and
go through the balcony, brother?
No.
- Not your mistake, though
WhoeVer stays in that house, does
take a fall in his lifetime
lt's because of the sight ahead.
- You're right
And l wish you keep doing
this to me eVery day
l feel so nice today!
You...? Already here to pick me up?
l told you to call up and come
No, l can't go with you so early.
Okay, do something
Look around Goa for a couple of
days, then we'll leaVe together
Who is he?
- Our new manager
He'll kill me!
You sent for me, sir?
Are you Suraj?
- No
Suraj Prakash.
- Time for you to set, Suraj (Sun)
You won't eVer rise
in the morning again
ln your 14 years of serVice, you
were neVer in the night shift
From now on you will work
in the night for a month
Sir, l'll die.
- Two months
l'll be ruined, sir.
- Three months
And listen...
- Yes sir?
Sleep is man's worst weakness
And the time between 3 and 5
is the most Vulnerable one
lf l see your shoulders droop at
that time, you are off the roster
l get it
Mr Sameer
When did you get this motorbike?
- My company gaVe it to me today
No, you got it yesterday.
- Today
You're talking about the motorbike,
l'm talking about your eyes
You clapped your eyes on
Rani yesterday, right?
Rani? Who? l'm watching
the kids play
Really? l'm a gifted astrologer
l'Ve seen your horoscope. Let
me introduce you to Rani
Else, you will keep falling
off your window
l'm a priest of LoVe. Because of
us priests, two hearts meet...
a family is made, new
babies are born..
... there's no greater joy than this
Her father, the colonel,
is a strict man, l hear
He's retired. He may
be pulled up any time
He won't find a better son-in-law.
- NeVer
He's going to embrace you
in the first meeting itself
Bye
ls Ms Rani cross with you?
- No
Then why is she going that way?
Yes, priest?
- Please come here
She's coming
Once you guys shake hands..
..it won't take much time
for your hearts to meet
Come... Be prepared
HaVen't seen the colonel for days.
- Our car's in the garage
He's gone to pick it up.
- lll-fated carburetor, l told him
He must at least fill
gas worth 1 25..
..but he won't spend
more than 25 bucks
Anyway... this is my childhood
friend Sameer
Not that we met in childhood...
the two of us met as adults
She's Rani
Sameer is a lifeguard, and
Rani is a fashion designer
Won't you shake hands?
Can't you take care of your kid?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got smacked
Who?
- Daddy!
What an introduction!
Who slapped him? lt sounded
like an explosion
Are you all right, Papa?
- Don't ask me, dear
lt feels as if someone hammered
a hot nail into my ear
You shouldn't haVe hit him so
hard. This boy is naughty
Thank God the colonel applied the
brakes in time and saVed him
Are you in your senses?
How dare you hit my Papa?
l didn't know he was your
father. And that kid...
What kid? Her mother is here, there
are so many people around...
but they didn't utter a word!
You wanted to be a hero, eh?
Stop fighting and take
him to a doctor, quick
Conductor? l need a doctor, dammit!
- That's where we're going
He's gone deaf! What haVe you done?
You were to ask Rani's hand from
him and you just handed it out to him
Who is Rani, sir?
You? Are you working day and night?
No sir. l just came to request you
Please be kind enough and turn my
bad nights into good nights, sir
What for?
- Because after office hours...
when l go home and shut the doors
and windows to catch a wink...
the kids around assemble outside
my house and scream together...
The matinee show begins now
And my wife takes it out on the
kids saying, No shows of late
Sir, my honour is at stake
All right. GiVe me
some time to think
Really? How much time?
- Say, a month or two
What?
- When will my duty hours change?
Three months after that
Who is this Rani, sir?
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
Once...
once it's gone...
youth neVer returns
What do you...
think about me?
Don't take me for a foe
Be my friend
Lay off. Let me go
Don't harass me
Sweetheart, so much...
of attitude is bad
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
My loVe, enjoy...
eVery moment
What you haVe, is in the present
Tomorrow neVer comes
l think you are crazy
You and l don't sail
in the same boat
l can't just...
stop following you
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
Once...
once it's gone...
youth neVer returns
Thank God you're here.
l was really worried
What for? Aren't we friends now?
Yeah, but your father
hasn't forgiVen me yet
When things go wrong in the beginning,
it all falls in place in the end
l don't get it. Please explain
l mean, l'Ve brought Papa around
and he has called you oVer for dinner
Really?
Look, he's an army officer
who is Very punctual
You will be there at nine sharp
l'll be there at eight.
- No way. Neither early, nor late
You look Very happy. Tommy's sister
says, see you at home...
as if you're going home to become
Tommy's brother-in-law
But to impress Tommy's father, don't
forget to buy champagne for him
And, you must uncork it at one go!
ls it Sameer?
- Yes, sir
Come on in. - Actually sir,
l'Ve come to apologise
l committed a mistake the other
day. Please forgiVe me
l'Ve forgiVen you, that is why
you are standing before me
LoVely dog
He's Tommy, not a dog
He's like my son. Remember
Sit
l'm from Patiala, Punjab.
- Really?
My uncle was in the army
Once l took his gun and ran to the
fields, for some shooting practice
Enraged, he snatched the gun...
and said, lt's an official gun
l was so peeVed that
l joined the army...
and l got my own gun
A few years later, war for
independence broke out in Goa
They posted me here in Goa
After the war, l settled
here with my family
Luckily, l loVe Goa
Luckily, l loVe Goa too
What do they call a chicken
in Punjab? - Kukdi
And a girl?
- Kudi
Those medals... did
you win them, sir?
My wife wasn't in the army, so
obViously they belong to me
Actually sir, your personality
unsettles me
That's why l'm talking like a fool
NeVer mind
And that Chinese pot
near the medals...
looks like an antique piece,
does it contain Chinese tea?
lt contains my late mother's ashes
lt giVes me a feeling that l always
haVe her blessings with me
You dearly loVed your mother.
- l still loVe her
We tried really hard to saVe her
But what God wills...
- Let it be, Papa
Let's eat
Why did you haVe to bring that, son?
lt's my first time here.
- Let me uncork it
No, sir. Let me haVe the pleasure
And to you, beautiful lady
What haVe you done?
What haVe you done?
Shut up! lt all happened
because of you
Because of me, really? - You asked
me to uncork it at one go
l asked you to open the bottle,
not to break the pot of ashes
Good that the pot broke. At least
it has set his mother's soul free
l think the colonel is insane
Oh no... he's a Very intelligent man
lntelligent, my foot! Mother's ashes
ought to be immersed in the Ganges
No one keeps it at home.
NeVer in a pot, at that!
lt's okay, we'll talk later.
- Let me clear this now
Please try to see it
from my point of View
Why don't you try to see
it from my point of View?
HaVe you seen the colonel?
He looks as if he grew
old twenty years back
Look at his wife... as if she
has just stepped into youth
Tell me, from what angle does Rani
look like the colonel's daughter?
Yeah, Tommy does appear
to be his son
l can't explain that. You should
be asking the person concerned
Who?
- Rani
The colonel would neVer
reVeal the secret to Rani
The other day l spared you because
it was only a mistake
But today, you intentionally...
You hit my Papa on his face...
still l forgaVe you. But today
you'Ve hurt me in the heart
Can you explain?
- Rani...
Did you intend to say that
my father didn't sire me?
No!
- That my mother is wanton?
No!
lt was tough conVincing myself
that you are a nice person
And you, priest! l'm
really surprised
How could you consider such
a lowly man a friend?
Let alone respect someone, he
hardly knows what respect means
See? She is hurt because of you!
- Because of me, really?
l was only kidding. When you knew
Rani was standing behind me...
why didn't you tell me?
- l was telling you...
see from my point of View!
- Your language is too tough for me
For all the mistakes you commit,
you pass the buck on to me! God!
Ball?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got thrashed
Who?
- Papa!
Granny!
l'm ill-fated, it's writ. Reading my
horoscope won't turn things around
Just checking what's worse
is in store. - What...?
Your past was your golden period.
- Golden period, really?
Yes. Your future is worse.
- Worse than what l'm going through?
Jupiter's place is right up here.
Yours is down in hell
The Moon's place is in the 7th
house. Yours is homeless
MoreoVer, Saturn is about to enter
You said, Saturn left me last week.
- And it did
Usually, once it leaVes, Saturn
neVer returns for another seVen years
Not in your case. Saturn is about
to re-enter in a few seconds time
Right, anything is possible with
me. - Saturn is on its way
And it will wreck me.
- This Saturn is going to...
change your life and destiny.
lt will come like a tempest
What say, dude?
He's going to steal
the princess away
As per my calculations, it will
stay with you in your room...
and knock at Rani's door
Hello uncle
Hello, l say. Remember me?
l'm your distant relatiVe. Sunny
For miles away, uncle has
no relatiVes. Go away
Uncle, your serVant is ill-mannered.
Ask him not to mess with me
Why is he so quiet? - Not that
he is glad to remain quiet
He's ailing.
- Shut up
Uncle, l'm Sunny. Mr Khurana's son
Who... Khur... ana? Who Khurana?
- Back in Gurudaspur...
this road in front of your house...
- There's one..
..in front of eVery house
it turns around the corner.
- They all turn. No road is straight
And where does it go? Straight
to his friend's house
Friend? Who?
- Mr Khosla
He just said Khurana!
- How smart! You caught me
l was only testing you. Know what?
When l asked your address...
eVeryone said there's only one
decent and honest boy in Goa. You
Boy...? What a fraud!
Tell me honestly, why are you here?
- Well, l...
want to hire a room
No, he says. Go away
No way, get lost, he says.
Look, he's pissed off
Now tell me.
- Stay here
Well, now that you are dumb,
you won't pick up a fight
So let's go to my relatiVe's place.
- RelatiVe, aunt? Then who am l?
Who are you?
- Sunny
Not Sunny, he's Shani (Saturn).
- Shut up, dude
Uncle, for my sake don't tell
aunt where l come from
Well, uncle himself doesn't
know where he comes from
Aunt, l'm a tenant here.
Here's 10,000 bucks
Take another 9,999... take care
l'm a bit tired. Show
me to my room, please
Let me see you off at the
next street. - Ass!..
..Hold this. Bring it upstairs
Oldie's got a nice room.
- Yes
But we are sharing it
What are you staring at me for? -
Why share? We'll be exchanging beds
We'll also sleep in the
same bed, as brothers...
Don't touch me. l don't like it
Like the rent, we share the room
too. This side is yours, that's mine
All right, giVe me a hug.
- No!
l don't hug men.
- Really? How Vain
WhateVer.
- Okay listen...
why don't you take your God there?
- God doesn't belong to one person
God belongs to eVeryone. And
listen, we'Ve shared the room...
not the walls. God's not moVing.
- And where do l stick my posters?
WhereVer you wish. God's not moVing
l got an idea. Stick them
up in the bathroom
Why do you get so angry?
- Am l angry?
Now! EVen while you are talking.
- Yeah, where am l angry?
Look, the room's got hot.
Need to open the window
Don't open the window!
Why?
- She comes there
l need to check her out then.
Since l pay half the rent...
l'll open half the window
You're on my half, let me embrace
you! - Don't piss me off!
l tried my best to keep him off
What a sight!
Mr Sameer deliberately kept
the door shut to keep me off
But smelling a scent from
a distance is my forte
What a dish!
- Don't you say that!
Does she mean anything to you?
- No. But decent folks stay here
By the way she is a
nice and decent girl
And she's a colonel's daughter.
He will shoot you if he hears you
For a beauty like her, l'd
take a bullet on my chest
On my chest
ldiotic!
Don't you jump!
- Why not?
You are in bad times, as it is
For all your good intentions, you
might fall on top of the colonel
He's going in.
- No. As per my calculations...
Tommy will haVe a go at him
He's gone inside. - Not to worry.
My calculations say...
the colonel will kick
him out in a minute
What's your name?
- Tommy
Nice name. My respects, uncle
Who are you?
What do you want?
- l just wanted to meet you, uncle
l'm new here. l'm told
that you are the only..
..decent and honest boy around
Boy?
- What else? Look at you
You can put any young man
to shame. Besides...
hang on. What's that in your ears?
And what's around your neck, bro?
Don't ask me. My blood boils
when l think of it
Screwed my calculations!
What are you doing?
- Worry not. l haVe fixed many bones
And it's only a sprain. Look
straight... here goes
What say? How do you feel?
Be honest.
- Feels nice
Where are you staying? - At your
neighbour Mr Duggal's place
The one who broke my
neck also stays there
Don't be angry. l'm his roommate.
l know he's ill-mannered...
and he'll surely change, but this
is not how one should treat an elder
A ball hit me, by mistake
Darling, what's happening? When
did you employ a masseur?
From today.
- Oh no, he's not a masseur, darling
Sunny is a nice boy
He's Mr Duggal's tenant.
- l see
Tell you something, massage
is not actually done indoors
A garden, or an open terrace
would be just amazing
We haVe a terrace garden.
- Don't tell me. Really? Where?
Upstairs.
- Can l check it out?
Sure
Did he swallow something?
He's dancing ... adVancing
towards the girl
Damn... your loVe-story began here
and ended in the colonel's ears
He began it by shaking hands, and
it's going to end in honeymoon
Sir, do something. Please
do something to me
What do l do to you?
- l want a baby
GiVe me a baby, please!
- What...?
What are you doing here?
- You! What are you doing here?
You know her?
- She is my wife
Don't you haVe children?
- Yes, two in fact
Boys, both. And you know
what these boys are like
l want a daughter.
- So why me? Ask him
Listen... please
What?
- He promised to giVe me a daughter
After duty hours, he used to
get me sweets and flowers...
and shut the doors and windows
But eVer since you put him
on the night shift...
the doors and windows only shut to
allow him get a good day's sleep
lt's a mistake but a
mistake is a mistake
You must also haVe committed
a mistake, by mistake, no?
Yes, you are right
And l can understand your problem.
l'll definitely help you
Hang on
From tomorrow, you will buy her
sweets and flowers eVery day
What the...? Get up
Was l wrong?
500 for grandma, 500 for
my sister's studies...
500 for her marriage, and 500...
For my roommate
What a sight!
lt's worth paying a hundred
thousand in rent
What are you upto?
- Watching the colonel
Really?
- Wanna check?
That's his daughter
Do they look alike?
No way! And what are you drinking?
Water.
- Really?
l swear by you.
- l see. Go on
Let me smell it... is this water?
Fenny is Goa's speciality. lt's
nothing but cashewnut juice
l see. l'll juice you!
l'm going to tell Mr Duggal
that you are boozing here
Listen...
Don't touch me.
- l won't booze anymore, promise
All right.
- One last swig
What's that?
- Oh, those?
Your God's on my wall, so l glued
my goddesses to your wall
So why get angry?
- l'm not angry
You are peeVed.
- l'm not
Relax... easy
You feel like abusing me.
- Not at all
l know, you want to tell
me something. - No
You want to hit me. Go on, hit me.
- No
C'mon, hit me.
- Oh no
Why don't you go to your half?
- Okay. Peace
Peace
What was that? Earthquake?
Mr Duggal, where did you pick that
roommate from? He boozes, and...
watches Rani through his binoculars,
You must go and inform the colonel
Oh, why would you inform the
colonel? The ass has stuffed you with money
Rather l'll go and inform him
Mr Duggal... looks like
he's deaf today
He's deaf
Young man, my neck feels better now
Hello aunt.
- Do something to my ear
Let me fix your neck first.
Fixing the ear is no big deal
lt will be all right. Where's Rani?
See, Rama? Though they share the
same room, they are poles apart
That swine injures me,
and the other...
the decent one, comes home eVeryday
to giVe me a massage
Hush, Tommy
Sameer is not around, then
who is Tommy barking at?
Dogs haVe a Very sharp memory, uncle
Tommy must be barking
at Sameer's thoughts
Where's Rani?
Bloody dog!
Guess what?
You look so happy. What giVes?
- This year, the All lndia...
Fashion Designers' competition
is going to be held in Goa
The designs l had sent
haVe been approVed
And l'm participating this year!
Papa, l got to pay the entry fees
within two days. Only 20,000 Rupees
Let her haVe it. l'll return
eVery cent after marriage
20,000? No dear, l can't
afford that much
Please Papa, for my sake. lt's
Very important for my career
Golden opportunities don't knock
twice. GiVe her the money
Where's the money, son?
l'm a retired colonel
We manage with my pension.
Where do l get 20,000 from?
Selfish father
You upset her
Expenses haVe already risen this
month. 1 2,000 for the hearing aid
3000 for my neck-collar. Where
do l get 20,000 from?
Why won't you giVe her? You
still haVe your eyes...
heart, lungs and kidneys intact.
l'll puncture them all
Granny you ask me not to lose
my temper! Tell me, why not?
The colonel won't giVe Rani the
money. Who will help the poor girl?
l wish l could strangle his...
Granny, l got a solid idea
Postpone your eye surgery.
Let's first help..
..Rani realise her dream. What say?
Besides, granny, Lord Krishna's
birthday is approaching
The Lord is here! Be careful
with your pots, lassies...
So much!
Let it go! That's not a biscuit
Bloody dog! Let it go
What's that?
Dearest Rani, l know you want to
become a famous fashion designer
l'm sending you money...
to help you cross the first hurdle
in the path of your progress
Not a faVour, just consider
it as a gift from a friend
And, if you win the show...
you will be happy, but my
happiness will be greater than yours
l expect nothing in return for
this small help. Not eVen thanks
Your well-wisher
How long will you conceal
your youth, my loVe?
How long will you torment
the bachelors?
Someday you are going to
become someone's bride
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
l'll buy you earrings and bangles...
l'll buy you eVerything, l swear
l'll steal the Moon, l'll
eVen pluck the stars...
l'll make the Sun bow
before you, l swear
Someday you will go crazy for me
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
The day l come as a bridegroom,
l won't go back...
l'll take you away in
a palanquin, l swear
l'll steal you away, before eVeryone
l'll make you my bride, l swear
How long will you show
indifference, my loVe?
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
How long will you conceal
your youth, my loVe?
How long will you torment
the bachelors?
Someday you are going to
become someone's bride
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
l will marry you
l will marry you
You neVer told me you
play the guitar so well
What a reVelation!
All those lessons in guitar
seem worthwhile today
HaVe a laddoo.
- What's the occasion?
l told you l want to participate in
the fashion designing competition
l paid the entry fees today.
- Really?
l'll take two laddoos.
- Why?
One for me and one for my God
Go ahead
Bye
What a shame
Bloody untuned drum! Did your father
eVer play a guitar? GiVe it here
Papa is... a businessman in lndore
A businessman, really? And you
were playing the guitar, eh?
When did l say that? The poor
girl thought it was me
And you were tongue-tied,
no? You could only grin
Couldn't you say that it was me?
- Am l nuts to tell her that...
it wasn't me but it was our master
Sameer Malhotra who was playing?
She was so impressed, dude.
And she eVen saw the posters
of your goddesses
Know what she said? What a shame
You're in my half. l'll kiss anything
that comes my way, l told you
The priest said it right! You are
not Sunny but Shani (Saturn)
Stay away from me
l got my temper under control!
l wish l could tear you apart
He's coming.
- Sunny, haVen't l reminded you...
to pay the rent?
- l'Ve mailed the address to Daddy
He should be sending the money.
- lf it doesn't arriVe this time...
you will haVe to leaVe. Remember.
- Uncle...
did l eVer harass you? HaVe
l eVer troubled you, aunt?
Then why don't you clean
the railings? Look...
Pay the rent, we'll clean
it daily. What...?
He's gone.
- You should'Ve told me
ls Mr Duggal in?
- Yes. So?
There's a letter for Sunny
Sunny stays here, right?
- Yes, dammit! Go in
Mr Duggal, there's
a letter for Sunny
Hey, where are you going?
GiVe me.
- Two? Two letters?
Whom is the second letter for?
- Only one! l asked him to giVe it
So take it and driVe him out.
- l'm going
MoVe it. Do you fancy eating and
sleeping here? Has he left?
Okay, read the letter.
- lt's for Sunny
Why should we read it?
- Why not? He's our tenant
We must know what type
of a person he is..
..what kind of people write to him
Read
Go on
Let me open it.
- ls it made of steel?
Dearest son, Sunny, eVer since
you haVe left, l'Ve been worried
Your planes are grieVing. There's
no one to pilot them
son, without you, what use are six
bunglows and eight factories to me?
l hear, you are staying
with a beggar
lf you wish to extend
your stay, reVert back
l'll present a huge bungalow
to your landlord
Your Papa
l must leaVe now.
- Where are you going, son?
Papa hasn't sent money, not eVen
a letter. How can l stay here?
Did l really offend you? Do
you haVe a problem here, son?
No, no.
- All l haVe on me is a fake coin
You guys snatched 10,000
bucks from me..
..and you ask me if l haVe a problem
10,000? Just ask me, and l'll
giVe you 10,000 eVery day
But please don't quit this place
From now on, we'll cook for you.
l'll do your laundry too
Let go of my hand, will you? And
who will wear my underwear?
l will do that. l'll
eVen giVe you a bath
But don't eVer leaVe this place.
- Don't eVer go, son
Tell you something...
somebody has rightly said,
if you want true loVe...
stay in a poor man's shanty
Put the binoculars down! Else,
l'll inform the Colonel
Go ahead
Are you boozing? l told you
not to drink, didn't l?
Wait till l tell Mr Duggal.
- Go ahead and tell him
You wait here! Mr Duggal!
Who the hell...?
Are you boozing here?
- D'you want me to sit on the roof?
What if l fall down?
- You're drunk
l can't...! You are blind now,
l'll talk to you in the morning
Makes no difference. l'Ve
been blind since morning
Don't mind the poor fellow.
Here, grab your bottle
Here you are.
- See? That's a tenant
And you neVer treated
me eVen to a cup of tea
He's helping me liVe it up, you
know. - Where is he taking you?
Oh, l forgot! We got to
meet Bijli! Let's go
Come on. Not there... this way
Don't go. lt's a bad habit.
- Don't go, my foot!
Clear the litter, will you?
- He tells me to clear the litter
Don't do it. lt's my house.
Who is he to giVe orders?
l'm going to throw it away!
- Pick it up and throw it outside!
Here goes!
Bloody...!
Who got smashed?
- Who?
The Colonel
Who hit him?
- Brother Sameer
Our friendly neighbourhood hunter.
He's hunted many a colonel down!
You are in my half, let me kiss you
Go, neck Bijli!
Rani, once again, forgiVe me
Neck Bijli, you will be forgiVen
The thorn
Oh, the piercing thorn
Come, my loVe
Behind your bungalow,
under the berry tree...
my loVe...
a thorn pierced me
Now that you are in trouble,
you wonder...
why you couldn't stay without me
Your friends were right
when they said...
you will be trapped someday
Get that?
l'm sorry...
let bygones be bygones
SaVe my heart this time, my loVe
Your clothes are skimpy... eVen
the blindman says, show it to me
Show it
Get lost
MoVe it
Another 15,000? What for?
l haVe already paid 20,000
That was entry fees. 15,000
is entertainment tax
You should'Ve told me before. The
show is at hand, how can l raise...?
Entertainment tax is a goVernment
policy. EVerybody knows that
lf you don't pay by eVening, you
cannot do the show tomorrow
Why can't she? She is my Rani
Don't weep... please don't
You will do the show
l promise you, you will do the show
Sis, l just heard that
the goVernment says...
it's illegal to get a girl
married before she turns 21
Which means you haVe three
more years to go, sis
And your sister-in-law
has only three days
Why don't you concentrate on your
studies for the next three years?
Shall l break the pot?
Thank you, dear sister
Still short of 5000! l'm
seriously stressed now
You got to help me now, God
That was for my sister's studies!
You could'Ve broken Your piggy bank
Come here... do you know her?
Hot, eh...? You're throwing
kisses at your sisters...?
l can't figure out what to say
Many people are responsible
for this dream come true
But there is someone l
want to specially thank
l don't know his name,
nor do l recognise him
l'Ve neVer met him, but he's
the anonymous friend...
who helped me out when l
needed support the most
He calls himself my well-wisher
l appeal to him. if
you can hear me...
please come and meet me. l'd
like to personally thank you
My dear God, grandma always says that
a princess will come into my life
But not eVen a maid-serVant
has come into it till today
But l feel today as if the
Princess will surely come
God, don't mess up things.
l loVe her too much
l'd haVe called her home, but
Sunny's around, you see?
So l'Ve called her here.
Nothing wrong, is there?
Nothing wrong. EVerything
you'Ve done is good
l'Ve heard it all Sameer. That
which you tried to say...
and also that which you didn't say.
You did so much for me...
and didn't eVen let me know?
You shall pine at heart, my loVe...
by God, you too shall fall in loVe
At heart, l shall desire you too
by God, l hope l fall in loVe too
You're charming...
you're my loVe, you're my romance
l'm bowled oVer... yes,
l acknowledge that
l know, your loVe
is full of mischief
But l can't help it, my
heart just won't agree
How l wish l rule your heart
By God, may you fall in loVe too
They call me beautiful, they
call me the proud one...
and you'Ve gone crazy; you haVe
no control oVer your heart
l'm no less crazy. l'm
not conceding defeat
l'm here to steal your heart,
and steal it, l will
How l wish l begin to trust you
By God, l hope l fall in loVe too
May you begin to pine at heart
By God, may you fall in loVe too
God! What a sweet dream! Make
it come true, please!
Here she is!
By the way, You'Ve done a great
job in making her, God
Sunny...? Can't be!
God, why's he...?
Sunny! You...?
Which means you're
the well-wisher...?
l didn't want to say
it. But l knew...
you'd get to know some day.
- But...
Stop necking him! GiVe me the hug!
He's a fraud!
You... my...?
Rani!
Rani! Don't go with him!
l'm me... l'm not him!
l'm the one she loVes.
LeaVe her alone!
God! Make him see reason! Let
go of her cheek, you scoundrel!
Rani, l'm the real one! l'm not him!
Out of the way, Colonel!
Step aside!
What...? Step up...?
Out of the way!
Out!
What happened...? Who got smashed?
The Colonel got smashed!
Sunny, don't be shy, haVe
some more. Eat to your fill
The milk reminds me of home
This is your home too.
- Absolutely
We can't eVer forget what
you haVe done for our Rani
And you didn't eVen let me know.
- Ma always says...
your left hand must not know
what your right hand does
Hear that? Such lofty ideals! -
Pickles! l don't know where they are
Not pickles, ideals, darling.
- ldeals, l see
They are poles apart. One is an
angel while the other is a demon
The more distance l keep from him,
the closer he gets to deal a blow
With a football, when l'm at home.
With a bottle, when l'm outside
When l'm walking on the footpath..
..he calls me in the
middle of the road...
and rams his motorbike into me
Be careful. Say it again, Sameer
Colonel, l'm sorry, l'Ve
been a bloody fool
Accept these flowers
and please forgiVe me
Okay, l forgiVe you
Where does the Colonel get
his Voice? - God knows
Where did he transpire from?
Wake up! We are here
Who is this sleepy character?
- A security guard
He tried to mess with me, l put him
on a three-months' night shift
No wonder he brings his wife
to make an appeal to you
Uncle!
How are you, dear niece?
- You'Ve pulled down!
Can't tell you what
l'Ve been through
Rani's uncle? This man could'Ve
been your Cupid...
but you'Ve already plunged
him into the darkness
Brother-in-law, you are wrapped all
oVer in bandages? What happened?
Sunny, he is my wife's brother
Swine! Where haVe you
been all this while?
Brother, l'm cross with you. We
liVe in the same city, yet...
you haVen't been here for months.
- What city, sister?
l don't eVen get to see my wife.
- What does that mean?
This new manager, the swine, has put
me on night shift since two months
He sleeps during the daytime, and
stays up like an owl during the nights
He's suffering from constipation
and acidity
Look at the dark circles
below his eyes
That's fine, but who's
that scoundrel?
That's fine, but who are you?
- Uncle, he is Sunny. Our neighbour
l see. Glad to meet you.
- We'll meet later
You were talking about some manager...
- Don't eVen mention the swine
What has he done?
- He's made life miserable for me
What's his name?
- Bloody Saturn! Shut up
Sameer
Uncle, our Sameer. Your neighbour.
My roommate Sameer
What...? Sameer stays
in the neighbourhood?
Which beggar in the neighbourhood?
- Not a beggar, it's Sameer
One who wrecked you!
Now he's after him
That swine is after my whole family
Time's not faVourable, Sameer
Forget the flowers, forget the
colonel, placate the uncle
Uncle...
The tables haVe turned.
Now watch the fun
Uncle, aunt... l'Ve got
some presents for you
Skirt and blouse for you
Bush shirt for you, uncle
Sweets for the kids
Also some fruits for the two of you
l hope you don't expect these
things to bear fruit?
Oh no, of course not
Uncle, if by any chance l haVe
uttered something wrong...
please forgiVe me. l'Ve realised
that l'Ve been unfair to you
You are off the night shift.
- What...?
Then how about tonight...?
- Sure
Son-in-law...
- Son-in-law...?
Son-in-law, indeed. The other day
when l asked you about Rani...
had you answered me, you'd
haVe been married by now
And l would be your uncle
Uncle, a mistake is
committed by mistake
You must also haVe committed
a mistake, by mistake, no?
Aunt, am l wrong? - You are
absolutely right, son-in-law
Greetings.
- Greetings. Come in
Colonel sahib...
- You!
Don't you dare step inside!
Stay where you are
Colonel sahib, consider it
my bad luck or my karma...
for all my good intentions,
things inVariably go wrong...
and l end up hurting you.
- 5000 people liVe around here
Of all, why do you always
choose to hurt me?
Colonel sahib, the new year is
about to set in, in a few hours time
With the passing year, let
bygones be bygones, please
l beg your forgiVeness
D'you take me for a coward?
Remember, l'm a soldier
l kept forgiVing you because
l considered you a kid
Not anymore
Get this loud and clear
Henceforth, for 50
metres around me...
if l see you, or see you
throwing anything...
the last time l fired my gun
was against the Portuguese...
this time it's going to be you
Yes, colonel sahib
Happy happy new...
handcuffs
ls this a new way to wish
a new year? - l'll tell you
Where's Charles?
Charles? Or Sameer?
- Sameer?
ls he a new kid in the Charles gang?
HaVe women joined Charles' gang too?
There's no aunty here! Oh, this one?
What's the problem in his pants?
- Today he's become a police officer
Become, eh? Tell me something...
you're an honest officer's wife,
how do you know such criminals?
l'm not a criminal, ask
you neighbour if you wish
Who neighbour? The retired soldier?
Now l get it. After retirement
he's been sheltering criminals
Let me go. Rani is waiting for me.
- Waiting for what?
To murder someone? To loot a bank?
Or to print fake stamp papers?
- What the hell...?
Boy, you are going to rot here
until the police Van arriVes
Then you'll go to jail. Come
on, don't stare at him
The ass who smashed his head is on
the loose, and l'm trapped here
Am l wearing a conVict's clothes?
Am l going to meet Rani in 2010?
Ladies and gentleman...
and friends, let me show
you another magical act
Look, this is magic
ForgiVe me, Mr Magician, but
pulling out a bouquet from a cloth...
a pigeon from a turban and a rabbit
from a box is quite simple
l'll belieVe you if you
can cast a spell on me
He's challenging me
All right, boy, it's no big deal.
Lie down on the bench
Sure. That's no big magic
No, but it's going to be
Friends, now my magic wand is going
to suspend this boy in thin air
lf a stick can make someone
float in the air...
no one would care
to buy air tickets.
They would be waiting for the stick
l'm an astrologer, you see.
- Before you stands a magician, fool
C'mon, lie down!
- At your serVice
Windbag!
Here l go
Abracadabra! Let the
boy float in air
Don't mess with a magician! Or,
you will stay suspended in air
Magician, l belieVe you now
l fear, l might go right up there
l pray, put me down
All right
How he lifted him up, we
didn't eVen get to know
This girl wouldn't belieVe me
Rani, your arm on my shoulder
is one pretty sight
Let me make it simple
for you, Sameer
Stay 50 metres away from Papa and
500 metres away from me. You dig?
l'll show you guys a wonder now
You... please come here
Me...? - Don't go! He'll
put you in a box...
and hack you to pieces...
One boy. Any one, please
Mr Magician, there's a boy! Strong,
rough, tough and reliable
Seize your chance before
Sunny arriVes. Go!
Come this side, please.
- No, l'm fine here
Please come here
lf he is in, l'm off.
Find someone else
Hang on, lady
Rather l'd leaVe
l get it
The two of you are cross with
each other. All right...
l'll turn the enmity into
friendship. - Can you do that?
Of course, and l'll turn
your hatred into loVe
Hang on. Your name?
- Rani
And you are...?
- Sameer
So, Sameer and Rani...
the two of you are man
and wife from now on
And tonight, is your
first New Year night
Tell eVeryone how much
you loVe each other
What are you staring at?
- Admiring you
Had you not traipsed into my life,
l'd haVe been a nobody
l'd haVe been an anklet
sans the chime
l'd haVe been a soleless shoe
A heartless body
lf not for you, Rani...
- Not Rani...
call me Mrs Sameer Malhotra
To be honest, l fell in loVe
with you at first sight
l haVe endured so
much to possess you
Don't torment me anymore. Come...
Well... l can wait no longer either
Your beloVed seeks your heart
Come to me, my loVe
Profess your loVe
GiVe in to me, my loVe
l'm pining, so are you
l'm waiting for you
Profess your loVe
GiVe in to me, my loVe
Your charms...
like the tempest, my loVe
Your looks...
my identity, my loVe
Gaze into my eyes
Make me belong to you
Profess your loVe
GiVe in to me, my loVe
You haVe done me a faVour
You are in my dreams...
you are all l desire
Let's make a legend of loVe
Come my loVe, make me
go crazy in your loVe
Profess your loVe
GiVe in to me, my loVe
Your beloVed seeks your heart
Come to me, my loVe
Profess your loVe...
giVe in to me, my loVe
Come to me, my loVe
GiVe in to me, Sweetheart
The Prince has fallen in
loVe with the Princess...
Sameer, l'Ve been thinking.
- What?
You can play the guitar,
paint, sing...
you're quite a multi-talented man.
- Guess why?
That's because l'm me. Not you!
HaVing a ball, aren't you?
- You haVe a great talent too
What?
- You tell lies to fool people!
Listen, make a portrait for me too
Don't mind, but l paint
only beautiful people!
Know what?
- What, what?
l'm in a great mood today.
Say what you want to
You aren't as innocent
as you appear to be
Why?
How you brought Rani around
in just two hours last night
Weren't you jealous!
As close as you get to her, l
want to get closer to her too
Aren't you jealous? Aren't you?
What's your problem?
My problem is that l want to score
with my friend's girlfriends...
it makes me Very happy!
When l get married, l want you to
paint me and my wife together
You know, with her at my side.
And l lying down in her lap
She in black-and-white,
l in colour...
Sure, l will
Whom are you marrying? Bijli?
No, it's Rani
Aren't you jealous? Aren't you?
See? Your temper hurts you
yourself, doesn't it?
lf it wasn't for the oath, l'd haVe
squeezed him out like the tube!
Where's Sameer?
- The brush!
Get to be the master's
disciple! Quick!
Life's a dream...
Who...? Rani, you...?
You can eVen paint!
- Well, l...
My painting...? How sweet!
Tears and desires, that's how it is
You're quite a reVelation, Sunny.
- No reVelation
Painting, singing, the guitar...
No wonder they call
you multi-talented
Sameer's multi-talented too
You ought to haVe seen him
at the party last night
The way he sang and danced...
l'Ve been teaching him classical
dancing and he's into rock?
Anyway, fresh orange juice for
the two of you. Where's he?
He's in the latrine right now
He'll take some time. You can wait.
- No thank you
GiVe him some and you haVe
some too. Happy New Year
Was Rani here?
- Yes, she was
You'll now ask me if eVen my father
has eVen done any painting
And l'll say, my Papa's a Very
big businessman in lndore
You'll say, Liar, dog...
- That you really are
Your dream of making Rani fall in loVe
with you will remain a pipe dream
lt won't be a pipe dream. Because
l know what your weakness is
Really? What is it?
You can neVer tell Rani
that you loVe her
So listen! l swear it on my grandma!
l will profess my loVe to Rani in
the presence of the whole world today!
And l swear it on my
father in lndore too
l'm the one who'll bring Rani
to this house, as a bride
lf my loVe is true, l'll be
the one who'll marry Rani
And if l'm determined enough,
l'll lead her here by the hand
For me. You are Rani's brother
No brother. l'm her loVer
Rani, you think this loVer-boy is
an accomplished singer and painter
l'll expose him to you today
C'mon, sweetheart, let's go
This juice Rani brought
for you l'll haVe it
Hold it! Who did she bring it for?
- For you
So l'll drink it!
Share it with me!
l can't share anything of Rani's!
May you find it bitter!
l find eVerything of
Rani's to be sweet
At least let out a burp!
l'll paint a picture and
also sing a song...
and expose Sunny. Okay?
What new ailment is this? One
Duggal is difficult to tolerate
Three, fiVe...? More
than l can endure!
Where do you think you're
going? Stop there!
Lie down here, Rani. l'll
put them to bed and return
C'mon! Eagle!
l'm going to make you a seagull!
Senior! Swat this fly!
You'Ve made a mistake by messing
with the Eagle Gang!
One Sunny l can't tolerate. And
six of them walk up to me!
l'm going to thrash all
six of them! C'mon!
Tommy! Come here! Come!
You always bark at me, don't
you? So bark now... bark!
The next time you bark, you're
going to disappear. You get that...?
Take care of your
kids and your dogs!
l'll spare you this time.
Next time, you're gone
Tommy, my son, don't
keep going outside
There are bad people in the locality
HaVe l eVer raised my
Voice with you? HaVe l?
And how Sameer was yelling at you
yesterday! The insolent chap!
Go and play in the house, son. And
don't go out... my good son!
Tommy! Tommy...
Tommy, where haVe you gone?
You ought to haVe considered what
would happen to me without you!
Darling, we too are sad
that Tommy's gone missing
But how long will you keep
starVing, thinking about him?
Let's eat, Papa. l'm hungry too
No, my child. l don't feel like it
Colonel...
l'Ve looked eVerywhere in Goa,
but there's no trace of Tommy
l don't know where he has gone.
Could someone haVe kidnapped him?
But who could be Tommy's enemy?
Mr Duggal! That's it
No... he hasn't been around
since yesterday
Sameer...?
- Why Sameer?
No, can't be Sameer. But he could
do a thing like this too.
Remember his public threat? That
he'd make the dog disappear!
lf the dog barks, l'll kill
him, l'll finish him!
No way, he was drunk.
- Really...? But who then...?
He's the culprit!
Who is it?
That scoundrel has broken me
in eVery part of my body!
l don't know what reVenge
he is extracting from me...
by haVing Tommy separated from me!
Sameer! Where are you
hiding, you thief?
This is a warning! lf you don't
return Tommy to me in 24 hours...
l'll haVe you sent to jail!
l still hold sway among the cops.
l'm not sparing you!
What does that mean?
- He has influence
GiVe him the dog! May
the worms get you!
What new fuss is this...?
HaVe your father treated
Why'd l haVe my brother-in-law
kidnapped anyway? Why...?
Where am l going to look
for this dog now?
You haVe a Variety of dogs
- Hush!
Don't call them dogs.
They take offense
l'Ve brought them up
like my own children
That's Rustom, that's Sohrab.
Eats less, snarls all the time
That's Cyrus. Faithful. But
eats and enjoys a good life
And that is...
This is the dog l want.
Do you haVe it?
l do haVe it! That's
my boy, Tin Tin!
Say hello!
Quite a good boy. But once
he loses his temper...
he's going to bite. And remember...
don't eVer giVe him a cold bath
But this one doesn't haVe a
black spot. - Don't worry!
Here's the solution!
Mr Colonel... look who's here
Tommy! My son...! Where
had you gone away to?
Where did you find him, Sameer?
- The poor chap...
was sitting by a lamp-post, shiVering.
He used to always bark at me
But this time, he said, Papa...
and went for my feet
He appeared to be telling me,
Please take me to my Papa
Papa...?
- You
Oh yes! He's like my son, of course!
Papa, it's because of Sameer
that we haVe Tommy back today
You must forgiVe him at least now.
- Sure, l forgiVe him!
Rama, lay the table
What's happening here?
Look at this, Sunny! Tommy's
back today because of Sameer
Look me in the eye, my brother!
Where did you find the dog...?
Where did you find it? l
went mad looking for it!
For Rani's sake, look into my eyes!
Where did you find the dog? Tell me!
Sunny, l don't know what's
gotten into my Tommy
He's been behaVing like a stranger
eVer since he has returned
He seems to haVe changed.
- He has stayed with the stray dogs
l know a cure! Squeeze him
in a bucket of cold water!
Squeeze him ?
- l mean, giVe him a cold bath
Oh, l see. All right
Please sit down.
- Won't you giVe Tommy a bath?
No! l'll first giVe Tommy a bath.
l'll haVe breakfast later
The breakfast will get cold, papa.
- l'll be back soon, my child
Let's take a bath, Tommy boy!
- Where's Sameer?
Sunny, please call Sameer, will
you? - Not me, he sleeps till late
He'll hit me for no reason.
You go and call him instead
All right, l'll call him
We shall oVercome...
Who is it?
Are you asleep, Sameer? Wake up!
Sunny, don't change your Voice
and bother me! Let me sleep!
Rani...? One second.
l'll be out there
Who are you...?
Who on earth are you?
- Bijli
But who...?
- lt's Rani
One moment, Rani. l'm coming!
What are you doing here?
What?
- What are you doing here?
l was sleeping with you
l came to call you for breakfast
l'Ve said nothing! l'll
join you in two seconds!
Go away!
- Where?
Want me to come...?
- Go away!
GiVe that to me?
- What?
That one.
- What?
l'm coming inside
God!
l'm so sorry, Rani. How disgusting!
What you think is wrong, Rani!
- How about what l see?
This one...? lt's not
mine. lt's hers!
l'Ve done nothing wrong, Rani.
Please try to understand...
You...
l'll fix you! Rani...
That piece of thorn
l swear it on you, Rani!
l don't know that girl!
How could you with a girl
you don't know...?
l swear, l don't eVen know her!
- Without knowing them...
will you call just about any girl?
- Listen to me, Rani...
You'Ve started getting girls
into your bed now!
This is too much, Rani!
Listen to me!
Hey girl, can't you hear what
boss is saying to you?
Do just as the boss says. Okay?
Else the Eagle Gang will catch you
and present you to the boss, okay?
What are you guys saying?
- Command us, boss!
No one dares oppose you! Do what
you want to. Here on the streets!
Go for her! Grab her!
Grab her...?
- No, l won't
This was all that was left! You're
a loafer. And a drunkard!
You're a womaniser! Now you're
leader of the Eagle gang!
l'm not the leader.
- Shame on you, Sameer!
Forget her, boss. There's one
better than the other in Goa
Point out a girl. She'll
be in your arms
After a nice cold bath... Tommy
will become a handsome boy
He'll be good looking. Those
dirty dogs in the lane...?
don't eVer play with them, okay?
See how dirty you are
Good boy! Good boy!
BraVo...
What's this? A black dye?
So this isn't my Tommy! Hey...
are you a wild dog?
Rama! The dog has bitten me!
Rama! lt isn't our Tommy!
lt's a duplicate of Tommy! Sameer
has giVen us a wild dog!
The black dye came off when
l was giVing it a bath! Look!
l'm not sparing Sameer! He's
made the dog bite me!
God! He acts like a butcher!
After beating him black and blue..
..he's now setting
the dogs after him!
He has no respect for his elders!
He'll need to take 14 injections
in the stomach now
Go and take the first one.
- Go on...
Tiny injections they'll giVe him
Sameer, l'm Raj, the astrologer
Here you are! And l'Ve been
looking for you all oVer Goa
l'm looking for Sameer, too.
Let me know if you find him
l want to break his limbs!
- No...
liquor isn't good for you!
- lt's blessed wine
Look! Rani and Sunny...
No! lt isn't Rani! lt's someone else
Really? Very well
With you, l'll work wonders,
O beautiful one
With you, l'll work wonders,
O beautiful one
Let's rock to the music,
O beautiful one
How shall you haVe me...?
the whole world craVes me
The sight of you has driVen me
out of my mind, O beautiful one
Watch the wonders this boy is
going to work, O beautiful one
Come into my arms...
l'll show you the way to loVe
Take oVer my heart...
you'll be my life itself
l'm at war with myself, my blouse
is getting tighter...
answer the questions that rise
in my heart, beautiful one
Watch the wonders this boy is
going to work, O beautiful one
l'm one crazy man...
who's not in his senses
Feed it to my lips...

lt's a trap laid by my beauty
lt's beyond comparison
HaVing found you, l shall

Watch the wonders this boy is

Stop it, stop it...
Rickety old rickshaw!
- That'll be 40 rupees, ma'am
Here you are.
- But this is 20 Rupees
EVery senior citizen gets

Whether it's the bus
or a railway train
Besides, yours is a
rickety old rickshaw!
Grandma!
Grandma is here!
Look at this kid! He's

Sameer...
- Grandma, don't call Sameer
He's a bad boy!
- Why?
He ran away with my

And today, l will run

GiVe my glasses to me!

My glasses...

Make this old fossil

But he's my husband.
- What!
No, l'm her son!
- Son?
She's my Mummy! Mummy, ask grandma
to get me a chocolate!
My darling son, giVe
my glasses to me
On one condition.
- What?
We'll play Cricket with it.
- l can't see anything!
l'll toss it up like a ball.
You must catch it
EVeryone in Rani's family hates me.
That includes her dog, Tommy
Grandma, that's your grandson's
loVe story then
Now you tell me what l am to do.
- My son...
why must you worry?
Now that l haVe arriVed, eVerything
will be all right
Just show me the girl once. l'll go
and talk it oVer with her, okay?
Come, l'll show you.
- My son!
That's Rani, grandma
Where, son...?
- OVer there, grandma
She's right there
Yes, yes...
- lsn't she beautiful?
Absolutely beautiful! But
l can't see a thing!
You go to the office and get
on with your work, my son
l'll go to her house and
talk it oVer, okay?
Okay, grandma.
- Bye, son
My child...
- l'm here, ma'am
What spell haVe you cast on Sameer?
- What?
He's madly in loVe with you!
You're the only one he talks about,
in eVerything he does
What are you talking about?
You know the Colonel...
My child, l know the Colonel
is Very angry with Sameer
Once you agree to the wedding...
the Colonel will haVe
to get out of your way!
My child, do not be afraid. lf
you're in loVe with Sameer...
not the Colonel and
not any power in..
..the world can separate you both!
Sameer? And Rama?
My grandson will giVe you the
bliss the Colonel neVer could
lf you're afraid of the Colonel,
l'll help the two of you elope!
Sameer hasn't come yet.
l wonder what's up
He'll come, grandma
Here he is.
- Grandma...
HaVe you talked it oVer, grandma?
- Oh yes, son. l haVe
Very good. Has Rani agreed?
- Yes, Rani has agreed
You now need to talk to her mother..
..and she'll bring
the Colonel around
Make an eleVen rupee offering.
And that'll be it!
Grandma! That's water! The
coffee's in this one here!
EVer since my glasses haVe broken..
..l can't see a single thing, my son
Grandma, how could you haVe
spoken to Rani then?
One uses his mouth to speak,
my son. Not one's eyes
You must'Ve chosen right.
- Sure
How many fingers, grandma?
- Four
Three... two...
- Grandma!
l'm not totally blind yet, son.
l can still see a bit
And why must you worry? Go and
talk it oVer with Rani's mother
Sameer!
Let me haVe your glasses
fixed, ma'am
ln just a little while, we'll
reach your in-laws' house
And here we are!
Praise the Colonel!
- What are you doing?
Holy water from St. Peter's church.
Go on. Neither is the
old man there...
..nor is your future wife.
Go and talk it oVer with your
future mother-in-law!
Will she listen to me?
- Of course
Just latch the door from inside!
- Why ?
Neither will she go out,
nor will she send you out
Once the matter is settled,
unlatch the door. Very simple
Go on. l'm right here!
Sameer... why are you
latching the door?
So that you don't send
me out of the house...
nor leaVe the house yourself
Was this the time for this angel
of death to return...?
What you're doing is wrong, Sameer
ls falling in loVe wrong?
l ask you...
haVe you neVer been in loVe?
- Well, l...
You haVe, haVen't you?
So why all the restrictions
in my loVe?
Now look, Sameer. You...
Sameer! Where's Sameer?
He's in there, with your wife
- What...?
You can't go inside till
Sameer's work is oVer
Till Sameer's work is done...?
GiVe me an opportunity. l haVe
so much to giVe in loVe!
l beg you, Sameer. Please go away
No. Unless you agree,
l can't go away
lt'll take only two minutes.
Let him do it, Colonel!
l'll see what he's upto!
Colonel!
Why're you so scared eVen after
grandma has spoken to you?
The Colonel used to be a colonel.
And you are the colonel
of this family
lf you say yes, what can
the colonel do about it?
For God's sake, leaVe my sari alone!
Let them get on with it!
lf the youngsters run away,
who'll lose face...?
Who'll get a bad name...?
- Get lost!
Your sari's stuck
Don't worry. l'll haVe it freed
Look at the eVil man!
What's on your mind, my child?
like you folks think
Nothing happened...
Sameer didn't misbehaVe with me
l thought Very hard oVer it
What l feel is...
he had come to talk about you
He's madly in loVe with
you. What about you?
ls it Sameer? Or Sunny?
l don't understand, Mama
Sunny is a nice guy
l like Sameer too.
But Papa hates him
l'm in a dilemma.
- Look, my child...
don't worry about mine
and your father's likes
Decide for yourself
l'm finding it difficult to decide
What you got to gauge is,
who loVes you the most...
Sameer, or Sunny
And if you are still confused,
leaVe it to God
My red Veil...
flutters in the flowing wind
And my beloVed casts
glances at me...
on the sly
l know he will loVe me...
but he'll make my life miserable
Red Veil...
your red Veil...
flutters in the flowing wind
Your red Veil flutters
in the flowing wind
And your beloVed casts
glances at you...
on the sly
l'll giVe you my heart...
l'll eVen die for you
For all my efforts to
hide my pretty face...
it hardly took time for
the cruel breeze...
to break my resolVe
Your moon-like face has
cast a spell all around
The sight of you...
puts eVen the moon to shame
l'm coy.
- Goodness me
l'm apprehensiVe.
- Goodness me
Come into my arms, let not
this opportunity go wasted
Your beloVed has already seen you...
on the sly, though
l'll giVe you my heart...
l'll eVen die for you
l know he will loVe me...
but he'll make life miserable for me
This fragrant ambience...
inVites us to make loVe
My pretty loVe...
giVe in to your beloVed
The fragrance of your loVe...
has merged into my breath
Here, my loVe, l giVe
up eVerything...
l giVe in to you
You are desirous...
- Goodness me
you admit.
- Goodness me
No stopping me now...
l'm unstoppable
My beloVed has seen me...
on the sly
l know he will loVe me...
but he'll make life miserable for me
l'll giVe you my heart...
l'll eVen die for you
My red Veil...
flutters in the flowing wind
Your red Veil...
flutters in the flowing wind
And your beloVed casts
glances at you...
on the sly, though
l know he will loVe me...
but he'll make my life miserable
l'll giVe you my heart...
l'll eVen die for you
My son, you came here
in quest of peace
Where will you go now?
- l'll go to a place...
where there are no people at all.
The Andaman-Nicobar islands
You'll clash with a guy eVen if
he's the only one around in town
Do what you will, but you
can't change your destiny
l know how much you
loVe Rani, my son
Will you leaVe her also and go away?
l'm not happy to leaVe
l haVe to go away. That's
how the situation is
Let's go, grandma. lt's
time the boat sailed
Look after yourself.
- Sameer...
well, well! The priest,
if not Rani, what say?
What's up?
- l'm leaVing
Hey! You can't leaVe me and go away
Not you alone. l'm leaVing
this world behind
You'Ve only seen Rani
and me getting together
Won't you stay for the wedding?
Guess who played the biggest role
in bringing Rani and me together?
He kept making mistakes and
she kept getting closer to me
Oh yes, that's a solid
idea you gaVe me!
Of publicly proposing to Rani!
lncidentally, lndia and Pakistan
are playing a cricket match today
l'Ve inVited her father.
Rani will be there too
l'm thinking of saying
it to her in public!
Rani, will you marry me?
You're lucky...
because l'Ve stopped
dreaming about Rani
Enjoy yourself
Fights, brawls, show of temper...
and proposing to girls
are things real men do
l'd rather you play
the guitar, Sameer
Today's match is going to
be a terrific affair...
because, for the first time, we
haVe the lndian and Pakistani teams...
playing a friendly match in
this stadium in Goa today
Paa-ji's here!
Get out of the way!
Where do you think you're
going? Get out!
Who's that in the stadium?
He's grabbed the mike from Pa-ji
l'll...
Rani! Where are you?
He's come here, looking for Rani!
Who's Rani?
What's he shouting Rani
for? Who's she?
lt has to do with the heart.
Keep it up, braVe lad!
Go for her!
Looks like it has to do with loVe
Rani... listen to me...
Where're you hiding, sis-in-law?
The boss is so upset!
He'll find her. He sure will.
- Sis-in-law!
Rani... where are you?
You mess with my mike?
You fight with me?
Rani! All l'll say is that
you mustn't marry Sunny!
He's not worthy of you! lt's
a question of your life!
Hold it, hold it...
he has something to say. Looks
like it has to do with loVe
Here you are
Rani, l'm not the sort
of guy you think l am
Yes, l made the mistake of keeping
my temper under control
Else, l'd haVe beaten Sunny black
and blue and throw him out of Goa
But Sunny's done a wonderful
thing today
He has stopped me from going away
There's something l want
to say to you, Rani
Rani...
l loVe you
l haVe loVed you eVer since
l first set eyes on you
Since the day the Colonel
started hating me
Colonel...
l'Ve made a lot of mistakes.
Please forgiVe me
Rani, if you're not
in loVe with me...
it's cool. l'll go away
But l haVe a feeling that you do
That you do loVe me
And thus, l publicly...
He's Very upset!
l'm not asking for too much. l
only want you to marry me...
so that we can haVe a family.
We can haVe kids...
who take after you in looks; eyes,
nose, lips, cheeks et al
l only want them to
haVe my surname...
because my dad had the
surname Malhotra
All l want to say to you is...
Ask her, Will you marry me?
- l'll marry you, if she doesn't!
Rani...
will you marry me?
Louder!
Will you marry me?
Can't hear you!
Rani! Will you marry me?
Will you marry me...?
Say yes, sister-in-law.
- Please say yes!
Rani, l think he's the
right boy for you
He at least won't hit me
after he's married to you
Say yes, girl! Go on!
That's a spirited boy.
He's in loVe with you!
He's saying as much in
public. So say yes!
Let the birds fly!
Say yes, sister-in-law!
Go on, my child. Go!
Our kids will take after
you in eyes and smile
And l like the surname Malhotra
Could l haVe the mike, please?
As my mother used to say...
anger is loVe's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper,
can't control anything in his lifetime
Sameer, my mother says, anger
is loVe's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper,
can't control anything in his lifetime
Not your mother! That's what my
friend Arun's mother used to say!
You remember what your
friend used to say
But you'Ve forgotten your friend?
You can't be Arun!
You're a scoundrel!
Arun was a gem of a guy!
Guess whose house l went to first,
on my return from America...
after 19 years? Yours!
Sameer's not here. Who are you?
- lt's me!
Sameer's childhood friend. Arun!
Good God!
Where's my buddy, grandma?
- He's away in Goa
ls he still as hot-tempered,
or has he calmed down?
His temper has got worse
with age, my son
Grandma then told me
about your problem...
how you had had a heart-break,
how you had gone away to Goa...
met Rani there and fallen
in loVe with her...
and how, for her sake, you
had suppressed your anger
Okay then. l'll go and phone Sameer
No, grandma. You won't
say a word to him
l'm going to treat him not as his
friend, but as his adVersary
That's how l landed in Goa...
to stay with your house,
in your room, with you!
l now know why you did this
all the time, buddy boy!
C'mon!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- HaVe an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- HaVe dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas!
- HaVe an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- HaVe dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
What happened?
What's up now?
All oVer again!
What wrong haVe l done now?
- You're ill-fated, son
l'm jinxed! But nothing
can go wrong now
The poor chap's been suffering
all this while
For your sake, he has
remained a bachelor
You shall now become his bride...
marry him
marry him
lt seemed as if this
chap was my tormentor
But he's the one who has
shown me the right path
HoweVer, you are the one
who shall become my bride
You must become his sister-in-law...
you must marry me
