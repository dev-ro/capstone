Mmm.
Mmm.
That looks good.
It's a hot dog, yeah?
Yeah.
Man, I can't even...
Can't even see the hot dog
in that hot dog, right?
Hey.
You know what
you want, hon?
Um. Almost.
Uh...
It's been a while.
Do you remember me?
Well, I get a lot of people
in here, so...
Right. Right.
You look a little thinner
a couple of years ago?
I kinda remember
a couple coming in here a lot.
That was, um...
That was my fianc√©e.
We used to...
I don't think
I've gained weight, though.
Maybe it
was someone else.
My memory's
shot to shit, hon.
Has it really been
that long?
So are you waiting
for someone, or...?
No, it's just me.
...when you
look down, and you realize
there's no phone
in your pocket.
That happens all the time.
Right? Now, did you know
that sensation
actually has a name?
Scientists call it
phantom vibration.
You feel like
your phone is vibrating,
but it's actually not.
It's just your body...
It's crazy. I didn't
know there was a name for that.
Well, not only
is there a name...
Boy, you really
lucked out tonight, Heather.
Thank you so much.
She had a good time.
And I hope you did too.
We'll see you next time.
Are you
searching for something?
Is baggage
weighing you down?
Wish you could restart?
Well, now you can.
And guess
how much it costs.
Absolutely nothing.
It's free.
Join us on a retreat
to one of the most beautiful
and remote places
in the country
as you try
a brand-new program
guaranteed to rid
the negative toxins
from your life.
Isn't it time?
Visit LetsGetPure.com
and face your demons today.
Now, that's
what I like to see!
Some of that good
St. Patrick's Day spirit!
Okay, everybody. Who's ready
to change their lives today?
Good, because
if you're not ready,
there's the door.
Go on, you can leave
if you like.
Okay.
Now, you've all heard
of the lemon-cleanse diet.
It was designed back
in the 1980s to help the body
rid itself
of negative toxins.
Those... Those things
that prevent
the body
from doing its job.
It originated with Ken Roberts
and his best-selling book,
The Purification
of the Lemon Cleanser.
The lemon cleanser has caught
on like wildfire in recent years.
In fact, some of your favorite
celebrities have done it.
But Mr. Roberts
felt he could do better.
Now I want you all
to close your eyes and relax.
Think about that pain
you felt.
That deep pain
that prevents you
from getting ahead in life.
We need to know that pain.
Keep thinking.
Keep thinking.
Keep thinking.
And open.
Now...
who wants to share
their pain first?
Yes, thank you.
One sec, here we go.
Oh, uh...
Mr. Roberts just wants to get
a good look at you.
Heh, heh.
Uh. So, uh, this, uh,
one time, I...
Uh, posted on Facebook
that my friend Darryl
was a... A dick-licker.
I guess I kind of feel
bad about that.
Is that what
you're looking for?
He's actually...
He's actually not a dick-licker.
Okay. Ha, ha.
What's wrong?
Come
on, I'm kidding.
This shit is weird.
Folks, it's...
It's really important that we...
We dig deep here.
You know,
your personal stories right now
are what will help us determine
who goes on the retreat.
Yes, in the back?
One sec.
Okay, hi, I'm Maggie.
Um. Ahem.
Yeah, I was married
for 10 years. Um...
We got hitched
after high school.
Uh. Yeah. My...
My husband wanted kids.
Ah, I was against it.
And then one day,
I came home and, um,
he blew his... He blew
his brains out with a shotgun.
And, um...
That's all we need.
Thank you.
- You can go ahead now, hon.
- Oh, not now.
- Go on. Go ahead.
- I don't...
Uh...
I'm-I'm Paul Berger.
I guess I don't know
if I have a lot of pain.
I mean, we all have bad days
once in a while, right?
Um, I recently lost my job.
I was engaged for a long time,
that didn't work out. What else?
Um, I'm from New Jersey,
which I know
what you're all thinking,
but New Jersey, it's...
It's actually a great place.
Have any of you heard of
a town called Newfield?
Well, it's a borough,
actually.
It was established
in 1924.
Have you ever
cleansed before?
Oh, no,
thank you.
I like
my sandwiches.
Yeah, I hear you.
I'm gonna miss
hot dogs.
This sounds real interesting,
though, don't it?
The idea of getting pure,
restarting your life?
- Keep pressure on that.
- Yeah.
When will I know
if they pick me?
They'll call you
today.
Pee in this cup.
Sorry, I didn't mean...
Hi, I'm Paul Berger.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, I just wanted to say that
that was really brave of you.
What was?
What you just said in...
I'm sorry
about your husband.
I-I-I can't believe
you had to see that.
That must
have been terrible.
Yeah, um...
I made that up.
What?
Well, didn't
you make yours up too?
I guess the way
you kept, you know,
going on
and on and on, you...
Oh, yeah. No.
I made mine up too.
Oh, I, uh,
gotta get that.
Okay, yeah. Sure.
Hey.
I... I hope you
get the call today.
Maybe I'll see you
there, huh?
All right,
I'll see you around.
Hello, this is Ken Roberts.
Thank you for
purchasing my book.
Although it was
first published in the 1980s,
you'll find that a lot
of my current principles
actually originated
in this early text.
So thank you for listening.
Chapter 1.
Since the days of Jesus Christ,
who fasted for 40 days,
men and women have abstained
from food for many reasons.
For health...
...political ends...
Oh. Oh, no.
Hey, uh, Zatik?
Uh-huh. Yeah, hi.
Could you come over, please?
I have a bit
of a rat situation.
I know you're
watching the game,
but if you could
just come over for...
One sec.
Sorry. Hello?
Hello, am I
speaking with Paul Berger?
Uh, Yeah.
Oh, good. I'm
so glad I caught you.
I'm calling on behalf
of the Roberts Institute.
Oh, hi.
Did we reach
you at a bad time?
No, no. This is a great time.
Berger!
Are you still there?
Rat.
Oh, thank you. Sorry.
Are you sure
this is a good time?
Uh-huh.
Well, we have good news.
You do? Okay.
We'd love for you to join Mr.
Roberts.
Really?
You have some
paperwork to sign,
and they'll have
someone pick you up tonight.
Okay.
Great. Enjoy your retreat.
Okay, great.
Got him.
"Death"?
Um, hi.
Are you with
the Roberts Institute?
Oh.
Hm?
Welcome.
How was the ride?
It was good.
Hi, I'm-I'm
Paul Berger.
Hi, Paul Berger.
I'm Fredericks.
Hello, Fredericks.
Let me get your bags.
Thank you.
Hey.
That's...
You got in too? That's...
...so crazy.
Yeah.
Oh! Oh, I'll get that.
Yeah. Heh.
You packed a lot.
Jesus,
you're like a girl.
Phew.
Someone got you good
there, huh?
- Huh?
- The... You...
Oh, they sure did.
My uncle had a cat,
used to scratch him
like that.
They can get real ornery, huh?
You have a cat?
Yeah, I have a cat.
I'll show you where
orientation is on the map.
Follow me.
I'll get you guys
settled in, huh?
Let me take that
for you.
Oh, it's okay.
I got it.
- No, please. I insist.
- I... I got...
Could you put that
under my...?
- That's it.
- You okay?
Uh-huh.
Come on,
you guys.
So are-are you
an actress?
Yeah, I-I used to be.
Yeah.
Your photo here looks
like one of those headshots.
It's an old one.
Gotcha.
Boy, it's been a long time
since I've seen the water.
Hey-o.
What's up, Jersey?
They picked him
off that dick-licker story?
Heh, heh.
- What's up, man? Hey.
- Hey.
So, uh, check this out.
She really wanted
to come here, right?
- And I'm... I'm trying to be a good dude...
- Sure.
but what the fuck
was up with that contract?
Kind of freaked me
the fuck out.
Yeah, no, it did
that to me too, but...
Come on, let it out.
What?
Let it out, out, out!
It feels good to get
that out, doesn't it?
Mmm. Thank you so much.
And welcome.
My name is Lily.
Now, I know you must be
starving from your trip
so let's get started
right away.
Fredericks is handing each
of you your own cleansing kit.
Each kit contains
four drinks,
which you must consume
by the end of the day.
Now, each of these drinks
is specifically
formulated for each of you,
so don't drink anyone else's
by mistake.
After you've completed
your four-course cleanse
you'll find additional
nutritional supplement
in your cabinets
for the rest of your stay.
No outside food.
It's prohibited.
Oh, whoa.
That tastes
like an asshole.
What? Baby, I thought
you said this is about
being open,
being honest, right?
Getting rid of all
the bad stuff, right?
Yes, it is, Eric.
And thank you
for your candor.
But you must know that
these drinks are very powerful,
and while they may seem
like a bitter pill to swallow,
I can assure you that
I completed the course myself.
And the anxiety
and sadness that I felt
was replaced by...
humility, a clear mind
and an open heart.
Good. Good, Paul. Good.
Fuck.
Fredericks here has been
cleansing for some time too.
We're hoping he completes
the course with all of you.
And now,
without further ado...
a message
from Ken Roberts.
Hello, everyone.
Congratulations on being
one of the chosen few
to take part in this retreat.
I'd also like
to say thank you.
It takes great courage
to do this.
It is not easy
to put yourself out there.
To... To risk judgment.
It's one of the hardest,
but most important,
things that we can do.
We all have our baggage, folks.
It's part of being human.
And letting it go
can be scary.
And confusing.
And what makes it
so confusing is that,
over time, well, we've actually
come to depend on it.
It's become familiar to us.
Like a best friend
to get us through the day
or a stuffed animal that...
That keeps us cozy at night,
and we cling to it
because we don't know
any better.
Especially when we're scared.
Now, the cleansing process
here won't be easy.
But we are
extraordinarily proud
of the system
we've created,
and so excited to take part
in this next step with you.
But you'll need to find
that inner strength.
It's over to you now.
I know you all have it,
and I'm so looking forward
to meeting you all
in the next few days.
Let's get pure.
Last one.
Stupid.
Fucking stupid. Stupid.
Fucking,
fucking stupid.
Did I spook you, babe?
Yeah.
Sorry.
So Lily and Fredericks
are weird as hell, huh?
You sure you did your research
on this place?
Ken Roberts
has helped a lot of people.
And... couples.
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Okay, well, I-I-I still
don't understand why
we need help,
but, uh, okay.
You finished
all of yours?
Yup.
Here.
What you do is...
You ready?
Grab your nose,
and pinch it,
and then take a sip,
and it should help.
That was hot.
Shut up.
Okay, so...
What is this thing?
What are...? What are we doing?
Are we supposed to...?
We do this, we leave here,
and we-we feel different, right?
We feel enlightened,
is that the deal?
Mm-hm.
I guess enlightenment
could be rad.
Want a nightcap?
Come on, don't...
Don't look at me like that.
You're acting like
I'm an alcoholic or some shit.
No.
Oh.
This is it?
Come on, Paul.
I know it's exhausting,
but you should take
great pride in the fact
that you've completed
your cleanse,
and that you're moving on
to the elimination process.
Right. Q-question. When you say
"elimination process," you...
You mean, like...
Heh, heh, right? 'Cause
I was doing a lot of that
last night, and a lot coming out
the other end too.
Yes, Eric.
That is part of
the elimination process.
And, of course, the next stage
will be termination,
and after that,
you're gonna feel wonderful.
Well, I already feel
good as hell, so, heh-heh-heh.
That's interesting, Eric.
Most people feel worse
before they feel better.
Laurie has been having
some trouble with her cleanse,
but I have faith
that, in her absence,
she'll be able
to focus and complete.
Yeah.
No, Laurie'll be good.
Fredericks?
And now,
I'd like you to...
...stare into
each other's eyes.
It's hard, isn't it?
Hard to look into
somebody else's eyes.
I want you all to remember
how hard this is,
because once you move
into the termination process,
once you finish this,
you'll finally be able to stare
into someone's eyes
in a real, meaningful way.
And it will be
a beautiful thing.
Oh, my... Oh, my God.
What the heck is that?
Okay.
Can I talk to Ken?
He'll be here
tomorrow.
He's not...? He'll... When?
Oh, this is just...
You seem upset.
Uh... Something...
came out of me,
I think.
That's perfectly normal.
All of your questions
will be answered
once Ken gets here.
What am I supposed
to do with you?
Right.
Okay.
Hmm?
I... You...
You were running pretty hard
out there, and then...
you just fell over.
So I brought you
back to your cabin.
Thanks.
Yeah. You probably
shouldn't be exercising
when you're cleansing.
You could hurt yourself.
I read that.
I read it in Ken's book.
We're supposed to limit
physical activity.
Look, um,
I appreciate you
bringing me back
to my cabin, but I'm...
Oh.
...good now.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
Yeah.
What the hell is that?
You haven't seen your...?
Are you sure you're ready?
I know it's weird
at first, but I...
I kind of like mine now,
and if you think about it,
it's kind of amazing...
Just open it up, Paul.
Oh, my God.
It's okay.
Fuck this.
Hey.
Well, I don't think
you should leave.
And... And don't you wanna
meet Ken Roberts?
Lily said he's coming
tomorrow.
Are you for real
right now?
Yeah, why?
You expect me
to stay around
after that thing
came out of me?
Yeah.
Maggie, you can't leave.
Where are you going?
If you have concerns,
you can always speak to me.
No one told us
about those things.
- Maggie...
- I didn't sign up for this shit.
I want you to know
it's perfectly normal
to have a hard time with this.
But you are exactly
where you need to be.
You all right?
What's up? You okay?
What do you need?
Want a little bit?
What, you thirsty
too, brosef?
Huh?
You're a thirsty
little turd, huh?
Thirsty little turd.
You're like a little me,
aren't you?
Hi, Paul.
Hey, I...
What happened?
It's okay, Paul.
I'm okay.
No, please...
Please don't go. Please.
I know. I know,
I'm so embarrassed.
It's so disgusting
that came out of me.
That came out of you?
It was smaller
at first. Yeah.
You know, I bet you hold
onto things too, huh?
I mean, I bet you and I are
a lot alike, aren't we, Paul?
I don't really
know you, really, so...
I'm so pathetic.
Oh, God.
I trapped him down there because
I didn't have the heart...
Should I get Lily for you?
No.
I have to do
this on my own.
What the...?
How come I don't...?
Hey. Um...
I don't know what to do.
Can you help me?
It just keeps crying,
and if I go to it,
it just hides, and then
it cries again and...
It's... It's
driving me insane.
Okay.
It got bigger too.
All right.
Come here, little guy.
Or girl.
I'm not... I won't
hurt you, I swear.
Hey.
Hm.
Well, luckily, I brought over
a secret weapon.
- Nuddy Budders?
- Oh, you like them too?
- No, they're loaded with crap.
- Yeah. It's...
This... It was in my bag
from an old trip.
I didn't bring this on purpose.
I'm not... I'm not cheating.
My thing loves this stuff.
Go on.
Come on.
Hm.
It's got teeth.
Yours has got teeth.
Yeah, he's teething.
I guess.
No, what are you doing?
Paul, I... I don't think
they should...
...get that close.
Sorry, it's just, they
were calling out for each other.
You haven't picked yours up yet,
have you?
It's not that bad, really.
It's just kind of like...
...weird butterballs.
This is so strange.
It's not that strange.
They did come out of us
after all, right?
Hello?
Yeah, babe.
Look, hey. Did you
drink your, uh...
...your last drink?
Huh?
Never mind.
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
I... I was gonna try to finish,
but they're too gross.
I just can't drink them.
Can you
just shut up for a second?
Just stop talking, please.
You're, like, giving me
a migraine.
Sorry.
It's fine. Why
are you apologizing?
Sorry.
You haven't eliminated once on
this entire retreat, have you?
- Eliminated?
- I must have...
I must have
thrown up and shit
like 20 times
up on that mountaintop.
You wouldn't believe...
what came out of me.
Okay.
It's starting to make
a lot of sense,
what they're doing here,
Laurie.
Like, I feel...
...different. I feel good.
Even those drinks
taste great to me now.
- Really?
- Yup.
You would know
if you finished your cleanse.
How can I finish
if you drank them all?
You're just jealous.
Stop being jealous.
Jealous?
We came out here
to fix you, Eric.
What's that noise?
Shit.
- Eric?
- Oh, shit. Hey!
- No, no, no.
- Eric.
Hey, what are you doing?
Please, stop it!
Get your hand out of...
No, don't
do that. Why...?
Why are you eating
your hand? Don't...
Why are you
eating yourself?
- That's crazy, look.
- Hm?
Well, he's...
...doing that, you know,
knuckle thing that you do.
Really?
Heh.
Heh.
Yours does the thing
that you do too.
The weird lip-twitch thing.
Not weird.
I didn't... We all have
our things, right?
So, what do you
do for fun?
Really? You wanna...
...get to know me,
like...
...right now?
Well, I mean,
they're calm now.
I mean, yeah. Yeah.
I figured, you know,
we can finally talk.
Okay.
The acting thing,
are you still doing that?
I'm sorry, I really don't
wanna talk about that.
Okay.
Yeah.
If you'd like to know
what I used to do
for a living,
I could tell you.
Well, I worked for this start-up
called Buzzy Brain.
It's... It's a huge
software company,
and I was there
from the beginning,
ever since It's Monkey Time.
It's Monkey Time?
Oh, it was one
of our first apps.
If you had a kid,
you would know it.
The kids went nuts for it.
It was a good job.
It really was.
And what happened?
With It's Monkey Time?
With your job.
Well...
That was... It kind of...
Around the same time
as the whole...
fianc√©e-stood-me-up-
at-the-altar incident and... I--
Let's not talk
about my old job.
I know you don't wanna talk
about it, the acting thing,
but I think it's great that you
have dreams you wanna pursue.
No, it's not.
It's the worst thing
in the world.
You just
end up getting...
...disappointed.
I wish I was like you.
I wish I had no dreams at all.
I didn't say
I have no dreams. I...
I have dreams.
Jeez.
Hey, hey.
Chill out, buddy.
There you go.
Getting jealous or something?
Aah.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
Fine.
It just nipped me a little,
that's all.
Maggie.
Psst. Maggie. Quit snoring
and check this out.
Look, they didn't get
any bigger overnight.
I found them like this
when I woke up.
Told you they weren't
gonna hurt each other.
Amazing, isn't it?
There are anywhere from...
50 to 75 trillion blood cells
in the human body.
Each cell
has its own life span.
Red blood cells last
for maybe four months.
White blood cells last for
approximately a year and a half.
Our bodies
are constantly changing.
It's comforting, isn't it?
To know that nothing's
permanent?
Mr. Roberts would like
to see you now.
He's here?
Oh, yes. He'd like to see
you both. And...
...you can bring them
with you.
He can help you finish.
And you double-cleansed.
You drank
someone else's cleanses.
It's important to know
it is a violation.
It's a simple action. You just
gotta follow through. Okay?
Paul? Maggie?
So great to finally see you
in the flesh.
Eric's just having a little
setback here, but...
Don't let the flames
put you off.
Come on. Let me get
a better look at you.
You're
better-looking in person.
Oh. How are you doing?
I know this can be
a scary process,
but all things considered,
you look like you're doing
pretty good. How's it going?
Talk to me.
What's on your mind?
Paul?
Well...
I really appreciate
what you're trying to do
here, Mr. Roberts, but...
...these things
that came out of us,
you didn't
tell us about that.
You lied to us. Well,
you didn't lie, but you...
didn't tell us
the whole story here.
Fantastic. It's unbelievable
that you could tell me that.
Maggie, do you mind if I...
...just had
a moment with Paul?
You know, you and I...
We actually have a lot more
in common than you think.
I was laughed out
of the medical community.
And it really hurt.
I mean, it hurt...
Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.
- What'd I just say?
Well, you said
that we're a lot alike.
Right.
Because we're human beings
in a lot of pain.
I'm really thrilled you're
becoming more aware of yours.
And I wanna ask you
a question.
I know that
your ex-fianc√©e hurt you,
and that's not your fault...
But is there anything
you're doing wrong?
Relationship-wise.
People sometimes say
I suffocate them.
Do you?
It's okay, we all
have our stuff.
Hey, Maggie?
Come on over here a second.
I'm gonna do a bit
more work with Eric.
Then we'll move on to
the final stage of our program.
You're in a really good place.
I'm excited about it.
Okay? So just
give me a second.
What did he say to you?
Uh...
- Did he make you cry?
- No.
No.
You look like
you were crying.
I wasn't crying.
Do we really have to wear
these blindfolds?
You're a tough
cookie, aren't you, Maggie?
We like to think
that...
...if you're trying
to look inward,
it just helps to remove
distractions,
so we can look into
our own void and face it.
Does that make sense?
Is that
satisfactory?
Yes.
Good.
Now, normally, I wouldn't
have you two together
at this part
of the process,
but Paul seems
a little uncertain
about my methods, so...
But I don't think
you'll have...
...any more doubts once you see
what we're about to do here.
So, Maggie, tell me. Why...?
Why did you come
to this retreat?
Well, I was married, and...
I'm just gonna stop you there.
I know that that was a story
that you fabricated
during the selection process.
Bu... I'm not angry at you,
but I just want to encourage you
to be honest with yourself.
You never had a husband, right?
Yeah. Don't remind me.
So why are you here?
I wanted to lose some weight,
okay? Is that satisfactory?
- Why'd you say it like that?
- What?
"Is that satisfactory?"
You're distancing yourself
from the process with sarcasm.
Don't you wanna get better?
Maggie? I asked you a question.
Don't you wanna get better?
Yeah.
Then respect the process, okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
So...
why are you here?
I don't like the way I look.
Sometimes.
Sometimes?
I could lose some weight.
So you lied about having
a husband,
and the act of suicide,
because you wanna
lose some weight?
- Yup.
- But why?
Because I went on an audition,
and the director said
I wasn't thin enough.
It couldn't be something
as superficial
as appearance
or going on an audition.
I hadn't been on one
in a long time.
I really wanted the part.
And he said
I had a stomach...
Maggie, there's no more time
for posturing.
Stop fucking around!
Why are you here?
You know what? Fuck you.
I've been fucked
around a lot, okay?
I put myself out there
for so long,
and I just thought, "Fuck it,
fuck it, that's it. I...
I give up."
And I'm getting older
now, and I don't know if...
...anyone could....
Or I would...
And I've been with
a lot of guys, okay?
They all just...
Thank you.
Okay, Maggie, we're gonna
finish what we started.
The cleanse you drank
has expelled all the negativity
from your life,
and put it into what you
see before you.
You've reached the final stage
of our program.
All right, I want you
to think about
everything you just told me...
...and pick up that knife...
...and end it.
End it now.
It's the only way
you can be free.
I can't.
I'm s... I'm sorry, I can't.
It's okay, Paul.
It's a lot to take in,
but you have to believe me.
I'm not the enemy here.
What are you doing?
Paul, don't go.
We can still fix this.
Maggie.
Maggie, hold on one sec.
Too fast.
Eric? Laurie?
Hello?
You okay?
Hey, man. What's wrong?
Paul, will you please
go away?
I would just like to stay
here with her.
Is Laurie...? Is she okay?
She couldn't get it out.
She just couldn't get it out.
She didn't finish her cleanse.
It fucked up her insides.
It's all my fault.
Lily says she's dead.
Will you please go away?
Does Ken know about this?
Paul, just get the fuck
out of here!
I wanna stay here with her!
Hey, look, I was gonna come
and see you...
We need to go now.
Hey, guys! Sorry. Sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.
You, um...
You probably heard about
what happened to Laurie, right?
It's important
that you understand
that what happened to her...
...is a result of not
following instructions.
You guys have been. You drank
all your cleanse, eliminated.
She didn't.
Anyway, given everything
that's happened, um...
we've decided that...
...the solution...
...to our current problem
is that, um...
Yeah, we need those back.
- What?
- What's in the bag.
Paul, listen. You guys have
shown so much courage.
But now I'm giving you
permission not to finish.
Just want you
to trust us.
Hand over what's in the bag.
Let us handle it.
Here, look.
Take my car.
Right over there.
Give me the bag, drive my car
away. We're finished.
Scout's honor.
Why...? Why do
you want them back?
It's a layered thing, really.
It's complex.
You're not strong enough
to finish.
- Yeah.
- Neither of you are.
But they're a part of us.
- You can't have them.
- Paul.
Fine.
You wanna know something?
I got a secret to tell you.
I didn't even finish
the cleanse. Me.
Didn't have the guts.
Lily had to do it for me.
She was the only one strong
enough to finish this program.
I guess we're not all
capable of change.
We just don't want anyone
else to get hurt.
Give us the bag, and we'll
shut this whole thing down.
It's over.
Get off me!
Paul. Paul.
It's gonna kill you, Paul.
Why did they just let us
go like that?
What if they're right?
What if we kill these things
and it helps?
I think we should just
pull over and end this.
But we don't know, Maggie.
- Yeah, exactly.
- It could get worse.
They've been in the bag
for a while.
They're probably just,
you know...
getting claustrophobic.
Hey.
It's okay. Shh.
It's okay.
It's all right.
- Sorry, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Paul.
Hm?
They're all sick...
Paul.
Watch out!
Fucking...
- Maggie. Maggie, don't.
- Fucking...
Maggie, stop!
Aah.
