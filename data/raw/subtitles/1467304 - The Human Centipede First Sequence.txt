Hi!
Yes um, I was wondering if
I could get driving directions...
to a nightclub called Bunker.
Yes, Bunker.
How exactly would I get there?
It's Amy!
Hello, sweetie!
OK.
How are you?
We miss you!
Yes, we wanted you to be
here with us.
Yes.
And how far is it?
No we're in Germany.
Then we travel to Italy in a couple of days.
Great.
Thanks.
Alveterzane!
I know.
Tell her we got her a present from Holland.
Yeah we got you a present.
No we can't tell you what it
is, it's a surprise.
Oh yeah, the other thing is that
we met this cute German waiter.
Jenny thinks he's pretty cute
Yeah, and he invited us to a party
tonight.
So we're going to go.
But we should go.
Maybe we can talk to you later.
OK.
All right.
We miss you!
Bye, Amy!
Kisses!
OK.
Bye, sweetie!
I think we were supposed to turn.
Turn!
I thought you knew exactly
where we were going!
Do we go left or right?
I'm sorry, but I just don't know
where we are.
What was that?
I have no idea.
You must have run over a pot hole or something.
We need to get out
and check it out.
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Why?
Oh God!
Okay, okay ...
Okay.
We call the rental car service.
Get the papers.
Okay.
Okay.
219,
200,
806.
What...
There's no signal.
What?
There's no signal!
There's always a signal.
Not out here in the middle of nowhere.
Oh my God, Shit!
Oh my God,
get back in the car.
OK ... Now what?
I don't know.
You know how to change a tire?
- No, I don't know how to change a tire.
- Neither do I.
What are we supposed to walk
until we find a house or a person or something?
Lindsay!
Lindsay. I am not getting out and walking.
Okay we're just going to sit here,
until the sun comes up.
I have heels and shorts on!
I'm not going outside!
Are those headlights?
Okay.
Roll down your window.
Are you kidding?!
I'm not going to just roll down the window.
Roll down the window.
He can help.
What's going on, girls?
Yeah um, we need help.
We have a flat tire.
I know you girls.
I've got a horny video
of you at home.
No, we speak English.
Can you help us?
You're always wet
between your legs, right?
Do not understand what he says.
Um, can you call someone?
I'll fuck you good and hard.
Would you like that?
"Ficken".
-Look it up.
Hold on a second.
Fucking!
He said Fucking!
- Okay. Bye.
- Roll your window up.
Goodbye.
- I'm sorry.
- I told you!
Is your door locked?
Yes, my door is locked.
Why's he still staring at us?
- Just don't look at him, okay?
- I'm not looking at him.
I just want to get out of here.
Okay.
We need to j-just go!
Gotta go from here.
We need to walk and find someplace,
somebody who can help us.
- Okay, but ...
- We have to!
But if we don't find a place in 10 minutes,
we are running back to this car.
We came ...
We came from over here, I swear.
How do you know?
All the trees look the same.
Leaving the car
was the stupidest idea.
We would have been waiting for hours, Jenny.
Yeah we could have been waiting
and it would not be freezing cold.
We need to go find help, Jenny.
Seriously find help?
How are we going to find help out here, Lindsay?
You agreed to come along, Jenny.
This is not just my fault.
I didn't want to stay in the car by myself.
We just got a little lost, okay?
- A little lost, Lindsay?
- Yes!
We are not a little lost!
We're really lost!
You know what, Lindsay?
I'm no longer walking.
I'm tired of walking, okay?
- Jenny, I'm trying!
- Trying what?
- Lindsay, we've been down here for like an hour Okay!?
- Yeah I know!
I'm tired and I'm cold.
I'M NOT MOVING!
- I'M NOT MOVING!
- Stop it.
No!
- Fine!
- Fine!
Fine.
- I'm staying right here.
- Good.
What is it?
My God is that a...
Is it a house?
Jenny!
Jenny, look!
I think it's a house!
I swear!
- It's a light! Let's go.
- What?
Let's go!
OH! FOR SOME REASON I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!
Oh thank God!
Come on!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Let's go to the front door!
Hello!
-Hello?
-Lindsay!
Come here!
- God!
- What?
Look at the dog!
- What about him?
- I don't like dogs.
I know you don't like dogs.
- Hello?
- Is anybody home?
See somebody?
No.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We got a flat tire.
Can we come in ?
Can we use your phone so we
can call the car company service?
Are you alone?
Yes.
We're alone.
Come in.
Have a seat.
You're tourists?
- We're on a road trip through Europe...
-It's a vacation.
We're from New York.
Can you call the emergency car service?
For us ...
Are you relatives?
- No.
- No, we're friends.
Very well.
I'll make your phone call.
Okay, thanks.
Something to drink?
- Water is fine.
- Yeah, just water.
Hello.
This is Dr. Heiter.
Sorry to call you so late.
But I've got two girls from New York
here with car trouble.
Well ...
At least he's calling the car company.
That's just great.
Yes, thanks a lot.
Bye.
Here you go.
Water ...
Water ...
They will arrive in half an hour.
Maximum.
You have a a really lovely home.
You live here with your wife?
No.
I don't like human beings.
God damn it!
Be careful, will you?
Stupid cow.
I'm sorry.
Is there something wrong
with your eyes? Idiot.
I'll get you another one.
- No, it's okay, it's okay.
- We can share.
I'll fetch a towel.
What just happened?
I don't know.
We need to get out of here right now.
Yeah.
It's freaking me out.
You want to just call a taxi
so we can go back to the hotel?
Let's go back to the hotel, okay.
- We'll get the car in the morning.
- Okay. Yeah.
I am really tired.
Listen, If you could just call a taxi service,
we're just going to go back to the hotel.
No. I don't do another phone call.
Can I call them then?
No.
- I'm tired.
- What?
I'm tired.
What's going on?
Look at me.
It's a rape drug.
What?
Rohypnol.
Oh my God! What!?
It causes drowsiness, dizziness,
disorientation and memory loss.
Are you kidding!?
What have you done?
Jenny!
Oh God!
What is it?
Jenny.
Jenny.
Jenny!
Jenny!
Jenny, wake up!
Jenny!
Oh God!
Jenny.
Lindsay!
Jenny!
What's happening?
What are you doing?
What's this?
What the fuck are you doing to us?
What are you doing?
Jenny!
Let us out!
My friend ...
You don't match.
I have to kill you.
Don't take it personally.
What's this?
What are you doing to us?
What is this?
Stop!
Jenny!
Who the fuck are you?
What is this?
Untie me, God damn it!
What are you doing?
Untie me.
Who the fuck are you?
Please ...
What are you doing?
It's going to be okay.
The Japanese possess
unbelievable strength
when backed into a corner.
The Japanese possess
incredible strength
when backed into a corner.
I'm Dr. Joseph Heiter.
Retired but still very well known as
the leading surgeon separating siamese twins.
You're a crazy Nazi.
I'll get you,
you dirty German madman.
In six months...
I designed a never seen operation,
not separating anymore...
But creating.
I transformed my three rottweilers
into a beautiful three hound construction.
Good news!
Your tissues match.
So ...
I will explain this spectacular operation
only once.
We start ...
With cutting the ligament patelar.
Also known as the ligament of the knee caps.
So knee extension...
Is no longer possible.
Pulling from "B" and "C"...
The central incisors,
and lateral incisors and canines.
From the upper and lower jaws...
Shut your mouth and untie me!
The lips from"B" and "C"...
and the anus of "A" and "B"...
are cut circular along the border
between buttock and rectum.
The mucus retains so.
Two pet acellular grafts
are prepaired
and lifted from the underlining tissue.
The shape incisions.
Below the chins, of "B" to "C"...
Up to their cheeks.
Connecting the circular skin parts...
Of anus and mouth.
From "A" to "B"
and  "B" to "C".
Connecting...
The pet acellular grafts
to the chin/cheek incisions  .
What are you babbling about?
You really think
you'll get away with this?
Creating...
A siamese triplet...
Connected...
By the gastric system.
Ingestion by "A"...
Passed through "B"...
And excretion by "C".
A human centipede.
First sequence.
Here's your breakfast...
Hey, wait a minute.
General anesthesia.
Please stop!
Lindsay!
Jenny...
I want my mom!
Have you gone mad?
Come here!
No!
Open up!
Please!
Stop!
Why are you doing this?
Open!
You need help!
You're a sick man!
I am a sick man.
HAHAHAHAHA!
If you do not open immediately I will...
Cut your knees...
And pull your teeth out
one by one!
... Without anesthesia.
It's your choice!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Stop!
No!
Please!
Please!
Why are you doing this?
Let me and Jenny go!
Please!
We'll give you anything!
Anything you want,
just let us go!
Don't worry...
It's only a tranquilizer.
Keep your head very still.
I don't want to lose one of your precious eyes.
Just kill me!
Ahh...
One of my rottweilers
tried to flee...
Just before the operation.
After I caught him...
He had to take the middle position.
In this position...
The healing pains...
Are twice as intense.
Do you already regret your little escape?
In fact I'm thankful for it.
Because now I know definitely,
you are...
the middle piece!
Just kill me now.
I'd rather be dead.
Game over.
Damn.
Power is cut off again..
Sorry!
Damn!
I'm so sorry.
Help!
My sweet centipede...
Looks good.
Healing well...
Your suffering will be over soon.
You're in a lot of pain, I know.
Nice.
Okay.
Better and better...
My Lead...
My Lead.
Hey man...
Hey man...
Come on up.
Stand up.
You can do it.
Up...
Come on up!
Up Up Up!
Yes, come on up!
Here...
Up!
Yeah, like that!
Very good!
Yeah!
I DID IT!
Do you really think
you're God?
Make it all go away, please.
Stop this.
Stop it now.
How dare you lock us up here?
You crazy idiot.
You'll regret this,
you filthy asshole.
European madman.
God damn, let us out!
Take the newspaper and bring it to me.
Yeah, good boy.
Come...
Come!
Bring me the newspaper...
Good boy.
Come!
Come!
Then let's walk a little.
Attention!
What the hell are you doing?
One, two, three, four.
Just die!
Enjoy your meal.
That's what you get.
I'm not your goddamn dog.
I'm not a dog.
You do this once more and I guarantee...
I'll pull your teeth out
one by one...
you kamikaze shit hole.
You want to bite me?
Now you can bite me.
Bite my boot...
Bite my boot!
Bite my boots!
Mister kamikaze is a chicken today.
Do you get off on this?
How dare you
turn your back to me?
Shit...
I have to shit...
I'm so sorry.
Forgive me.
AHAHAHAHAHAH!
Feed her!
FEED HER!
Swallow it bitch!
Swallow!
Feed her!
FEED HER!
I want to sleep...
I have to sleep.
Why didn't I cut your vocal cords?
If you don't shut up...
We will do a follow-up operation.
Finally! You want to move your ass.
That's fine with me.
Maybe you can even escape.
Come!
Come!
After you, please.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'll teach you to mind me!
Strong...
Good.
Constipated...
Laxatives.
Instant kind,
good stuff.
End section, you are very sick.
I think you're dying...
I will have to replace you.
Help!
Shut up!
Hello?
Police. We want to talk to you.
Just a second.
Help!
Help us, please!
We're in the cellar!
Hello...
Good day Mr. Heiter...
Police...
This is my colleague Voller.
And I'm Detective Kranz.
May we come in a moment?
Of course.
Come in.
Thank you.
Take a seat.
How can I help you?
Sir, people are missing.
Their vehicles were found
in your neighborhood.
Perhaps you could tell us more...
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong house.
I'm so busy at the moment
with my research and writing...
... That I hardly leave the house.
Can I offer you something
to drink?
Do you have coffee?
I'm afraid I don't have time
for coffee.
I have only water.
Mr. Kranz...
Thank you.
Mr. Voller...
So tell me,
what do you want to know?
Well we know you're
a first-rate surgeon...
... And we don't want
to disturb you.
But our investigation
has hit a dead end.
We're not here to arrest you
but you are a suspect.
I expect you have
your reasons.
But I have neither the time,
nor the patience...
... For the banality
of missing persons.
What is that cage
being used for?
Could you get to the point?
A witness heard
an American woman...
... Screaming on your property.
Can you explain that?
Absolutely not.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Your silver-colored Mercedes
was seen...
... At the place where the abandoned
Dutch truck was found.
What do you think?
You think there's a connection?
The nerve you guys have
to suspect me!
Finish your drinks
and get out of my house!
I have work to do!
Drink up!
Come on.
Drink up now!
Hurry up!
You will regret that!
I'll see you in court...
... And you can count
on being fired.
My apologies, I'm sorry.
I'm overworked...
I don't get enough sleep.
I'll just get a towel.
Help us!
We're in the cellar!
Dear Josef,
don't stress yourself.
Everything will be okay...
I've got two strong and healthy replacements.
So enjoy...
... Your last moments with the Jen tail...
... Because when I'm back,
I'm mercy killing you.
I'm going to prepare for a new operation...
A quadruplet!
See you...
What's in that cellar?
Now you're going too far.
Well what's in there?
My laboratory, a small workroom,
a torture chamber.
You're making a fool
of yourself.
Can we take a look around?
No way.
My research is off-limits
to you.
Do you have a search warrant?
I can have one in 15 minutes.
I'll ask you again:
What's in the cellar?
What you're doing is illegal,
as you should well know.
Shall I call the police?
As soon as you have a warrant,
you can look where you like.
What's this?
That...
That's insulin.
I have diabetes.
We'll be back in 20 minutes
with a search warrant.
If you want to waste
taxpayers' money,
that's your call.
See you soon.
Come on, we have
to get out of here.
One, two.
Okay?
One, two.
One.
Two.

Come on...

Why are we in this room?
Goddamn!
God!
... Eye for an eye...
... Tooth for a tooth.
Hey "God..."
Are you God?
I'm just a puny insect...
I cast out my parents,
left my child...
Dismissed their love
and led a selfish life...
... Just like an insect.
No, my existence is even lower
than an insect's.
But...
But dear "God..."
That's how I've lived!
And this is my punishment!
I want to believe...
... That I'm still a human being.
Hey girls...
Hey "God..."
What a fucked up world we're living in...
Police!
Dr. Heiter, police!
Dr. Heiter...
Well, God damn it...
