Inspired by true events
Poland, December 1945
Sister, sister!
Do you have money? - Take me to a doctor.
10 zlotys.
I have no money. - I'll help you if I get anything.
Is this good? No Polish or Russian doctor.
Why is that nun here?
Are you ready to go?
Come with me.
Is there still any penicillin here?
No, not anymore.
This is all.
Do you use it sometimes for yourself? - Very funny.
Doctor ... - I have no time.
You are needed here.
I need help. - I do not understand.
Sick woman ... Polish.
Here, only the French.
She will die.
The woman will die.
You have to go to the Polish Red Cross.
I do not understand. Help me.
The Polish Red Cross. - No. Please!
Sorry...
Help me. - Polish, okay?
Cut.
Good.
Take it off.
Who is that?
A doctor. I was worried. - Go to your cell.
Do you speak French?
Yes I speak French.
Are you a doctor? - I work for the Red Cross.
I'm Sister Mary.
This is our abbess, Mother Jadwiga Oledzka.
Mathilde Beaulieu.
Is this going to take long? - From yesterday.
Her family put her out of the house.
We take care of it here in the greatest secrecy.
Do not worry, I have my professional confidentiality.
Should it be that way? - Do you know any other way?
Don't fight it.
It's a breech. I will have to operate.
What did she say? - It'll be fine.
Get the priest! - Calm down.
The lamp.
Here.
I'll be back tomorrow with penicillin.
Thanks, but that's not necessary. We have our herbalist.
I want to check if there are any complications.
I do not understand your attitude. It's a simple request.
Easy for you but not necessarily for us.
If something goes wrong, you are also responsible for the mother and child.
Just tell me if I can come back tomorrow.
Come at the time of Laudes
That is the morning prayer.
During prayer I will let you inside. - Fine.
Hello.
Sorry.
There you are.
Tweezers.
Tweezers. If it's not inconvenient.
Have you just woken up?
It looks very ugly.
Compress.
What did you do last night?
I'll finish with Gaspard. Go get coffee or a shot of adrenaline.
Actually go to sleep... I can't use you.
I couldn't sleep. - Are you sleeping poorly? Since when?
Leave!
Go away!
Gaspard, compress.
You forget that our lives no longer belong to us.
I know you're sad
since God called our sister to his side two months ago.
But grief is not an excuse.
You have violated one of the rules: obedience.
And that's not the first time. - Forgive me, mother.
I've already forgiven you before. And I forgive you again.
Do not test our patience..
You will stay a week in your cell and take a vow of silence.
Sister Johanna will bring your food. That's all.
Did anyone see you? - No, I have not seen anyone.
I need to see the scar.
Show her the scar.
No.
Tell her to do it. - Sister, let her look.
I cannot do it.
I cannot do it.
This is in order to clean it. Twice a day.
I would like to see the baby. - He is not here anymore.
Mother Superior has taken him to Zofia's aunt.
I thought the baby had been rejected by the family. - Only her parents.
But this is a pious aunt with many children.
She will take good care of him.
Sister?
Sister Anna!
No.
I do not want...
I do not want to die.
Sister, leave us alone.
Join me in my office.
Follow me.
We were first persecuted by the Germans and then the Russians came.
For us, when they ...
broke into our monastery, it was ...
an indescribable nightmare ...
that only with with God's help we were able to overcome.
They stayed here two days.
How many sisters are in this state?
Seven.
Or six, now sister Zofia ...
God's help alone will not be enough.
We are in the hands of the Divine. - You need someone qualfied.
I can send some discreet women from the Polish Red Cross.
That would be the end of our Convent. They will close it.
Outside the Convent, they will shame our girls.
They will be hunted. Many girls will die.
It is my duty to keep our secret.
But they will give birth to ... - We will assist them.
He already told me that.
Then they go to heaven. Better for them.
But to me what matters is life.
Nobody will enter this Convent!
Good.
I will report it.
Miss!
Reverend Mother agrees. - Well, I'll find someone.
No, you should do it. - No, it was an emergency ...
You do it or nobody does.
Let's drink to the amputees and our failures.
Say something to me. You never said anything.
And girls who never say something that is rare.
Typically men talking.
I just have nothing to say. At home we were not allowed to talk at the table
or anywhere else.
A Catholic family ...
Bourgeoisie ... only daughter.
You're wrong. A working class family.
My parents were Communists of the first hour.
Okay...
They had relocated for my studies ...
and when I left everything to come here, they felt cheated.
You see, if you want, you can talk.
That's the vodka. You did it.
But enough about me. Now you.
Well, as for me..
A very wealthy family.
obviously not very Catholic.
with us, it was a lawyer or doctor.
And because I detest the "blah blah", I chose Medicine.
So you're the pride of your parents? - That was me.
She died in Bergen-Belsen. Fortunately, I'm an only child.
I left in '40 to London, but not through the Free Zone.
That was what saved me
I do not think I will go back to France after this mission.
I can go where I want.
I'm free.
You are not?
You have not had enough of this?
That anguished expression all the time ...
Enough melancholy.
Come on!
We are here.
I'm coming with you.
Goodnight.
I do not want that. - Me neither.
I mean it. - Me too.
What? - You're too old anyway.
That's very flattering of you, frankly....
That's not what you said the first time!
That's also a lie. I may be ugly, but not old.
You're not as ugly.
Oh no? Come here.
What? - Come here.
I see that as encouragement.
Watch out!
Help me! - How?
Help me!
I can not help you. - Help me!
With time you will become better and better in bed.
I heard something about the Communists. - Ah  .. Please ...
It's not propaganda
In your opinion...
What will happen to the Polish Church under the new regime?
What do you care about that now?
Since when are you interested in the Polish Church?
It was just a question.
I hope they have a terrible time.
And not only the Church, but also the population.
That's not very nice. What have the Poles done to you?
I cannot stand them.
They got what they deserved from the Russians and the Germans.
You're really bitter. - Maybe I have my reasons for that.
The only nice Polish were in the ghetto of Warsaw.
Now there's nobody left there.
Damn, the owners. If they hear us, its going to be a problem.
Nevermind, we will pretend they are not there.
So...
I can no longer reconcile my faith with this horrible event.
I still see myself as God's bride ...
yet he has so willed it.
Willed?
It has happened, so He willed it.
We can not know what God's will is.
The only truth is his love.
And this life that grows inadvertently in me ...
and which will soon be revealed ...
What does He want me to do with that?
Let us kneel, Sister.
We will pray.
That's our only consolation.
Your aunt has accepted the child as a gift from God.
They will love the child as if it were her own.
I know this is difficult to endure.
But it can deepen your faith and vocation.
The diocese has no replacement for our deceased Father Piasecki.
As for taking the vows ...
it has already been postponed twice. That cannot happen again.
The ceremony is in two months.
In the meantime, some of you will be examined
by the young woman from the Red Cross.
She will help you. You have to trust her.
The ceremony is in the spring. - Can we write our parents?
Of course!  - Sisters, our duties...
Sisters ...
Who goes first?
I'm afraid, are you?
You should lie down.
Lie down, sister.
Everything is fine. She can get dressed again.
No.
They need not be afraid. I just want to see if the baby is well.
Do not be afraid. They only want to see if the baby is healthy.
I do not want to go to Hell.
She fears for condemnation.
It is perhaps incomprehensible to the outside world ...
Despite what happened, we need to keep our chastity vow.
I know they have been abused.
I'm here to help. Tell me how to do it.
It is difficult.
We cannot show our body ...
and certainly cannot be touched. That's a sin.
I took a risk by coming here.
Can we put God aside as I study them?
You can not put aside God.
So what am I doing here?
I will try to talk to them.
Stop! Russian Army! No Trespassing.
Let her out!
Papers!
Hurry up!
I am a French doctor. - It's a Frenchwoman.
Frisk her. And you, search the car.
Come with me!
Help them search.
Let's have a look.
You're beautiful, you know?
Bravo!
Oh, how beautiful you are!
Stop! - And ...
Stop!
She likes it!
Get out of my way.
It's a party, she wants us all.
What is happening here?
Get Out!
Get back to your posts!
Officer ... - Papers!
What are you doing here?
New?
The French Red Cross?
Okay. You can leave.
Turn around. You can not pass here. Understood?
Come on, turn around!
What are you waiting for? Get out of here!
Nobody here is bothering you.
I'll tell the Mother Superior.
Run! Hide!
Run! Quick!
Get out of here!
Maria, take care of them.
You have to watch them. Go.
You two, over there!
You hide enemies of the people.
We aren't hiding anyone. - We will search everything.
You have no right. - We'll see.
Go look over there!
The kitchen!
Go now!
Come on. - Faster!
There is no one here. Look in the other rooms.
Do not do that.
Don't they know that the convent is in quarantine? Typhoid. An epidemic.
What does she say? - Typhoid?
Yes. - If you are lying...
There is no fever.
We have to leave. - It is very contagious.
Why did you not inform the authorities?
Answer!
How do I know if it's true?
They may go to the infirmary.
You may go to the infirmary.
Go to the infirmary? - No way!
Let's go.
We will report it.
Mother.
I'm tired.
Can I do something for you?
Do not you feel good?
... Thanks for your presence of mind.
Is she also ...
I must examine her.
She will not allow it.
She prefers to face fate alone.
She's too proud?
It's Mother Superior.
We should not judge her, we can only obey.
Pardon.
As much as I pray, I find no solace.
Every day I experience again what happened. Every day.
I still smell them.
They came back three times.
Every time they got us ...
I thought they will kill us.
It's a miracle they didn't.
Thank you.
I was less upset that the others.
I had been with a men in my previous life.
Most sisters were virgin.
But no one has lost faith?
You know, with faith ...
First you're like a child ...
your father takes you by the hand, and you feel safe.
Then comes a time ...
and I think it always comes...
that your father lets go of your hand.
You feel lost ...
alone in the dark. You call for help but no one answers.
No matter how well you prepare ...
you will still be surprised.
It hits you right in the heart.
That's the cross we bear.
Behind all joy is the cross.
Mathilde!
Please do not leave! - God bless you.
God bless you for everything.
I am so sorry. - Enough!
I do not care about your excuses.
You are part of a team. You're under my authority.
If you cannot bring discipline, I'll send you back to France.
Is that what you want? - No, sir, absolutely not.
It's your fault, you should be arrested. - Colonel.. please...
You are lucky that the Russians did not shoot.
You had no business there.
You ignored my orders. We were short a vehicle.
It was totally irresponsible.
I expect a report. You can go.
Do you know the Colonel is an old Cruz de Fuego?
So when he finds out you go to party meetings ...
Don't be ridiculous.
Enough mystery.
Make sure you write a good report.
I do not want her sent to France. I would really regret it..
You are very nice. - Me, nice?
Didn't I just say so?
Would you really mind?
You cannot imagine that?
I mean work. You are an excellent assistant.
I do not want to lose you. Even though you're a communist.
But no party member.
But he believes in a "new future".
You have to believe in something. - Don't you think?
What?
What still goes on in your head?
My head does not interest you. - No.
No, but what goes through it. - There's nothing going through my head.
What are you doing tonight? - I'm going to sleep. I'm tired.
You lie badly.
I can not come during the day. I am under surveillance.
I heard.
Without your hands.
What is true soon!
With such a rapid heartbeat is often a girl.
Probably a girl.
Sister, mother superior feels unwell.
I have to go to the abbess. Thank you, sister.
Do you have a sweetheart in France?
A lot. - Really?
Lie down.
You are very curious. - Yes, I have a lot of flaws.
I deserve the severest austerity.
My faith has never been great. And after what happened ...
I have lost all faith. I have no business here.
Why do not you leave?
I have no family. Only the old, pious aunt who sent me here.
After giving birth I am going to just look for my fiance, I do not know where.
Do you have a fiance?
I think constantly about him, but I can not talk about it. I would be punished.
He has caused this? A Russian soldier?
He defended me against the others.
He protected me. He even fought.
He kept them from killing us.
Sorry. Can you come?
Thank you.
Get dressed and go back to your cell.
Mother, let her examine you.
May I?
I see indeed skin injury. To be sure, I have to do a test.
A test?
It is an advanced syphilis. It can heal. There are medications.
I do not need your help.
And if two births occur at the same time?
I know. I keep thinking about it and it scares me.
Thank you.
We live for five years in fear.
For us nuns, the end of the war, does not mean the end of the fear.
The new regime will not spare us.
And you? Did you ever fear for your life?
Me?
I was a student when I went to the Red Cross.
And suddenly I was carrying stretchers in the firing line, with the liberation of Paris.
Sorry, but more than once, I peed in my pants.
But I have never regretted.
And I told myself that I would save lives.
Novice Irene is in a good mood tonight.
How can a baby be born this way?
How can we have not noticed anything?
An extreme immune response.
The body is resists and no one knows how far it has been, even themselves.
Does that mean ...
there might there be others?
Maybe.
What should we do?
How do I know?
I'm going to warn the Mother Superior. - It is useless to bother her now.
They must know each birth. She brings the baby to an adoptive family.
They do not realize how vulnerable a newborn is.
It is my duty to obey.
You have a higher duty: to protect the life of this child.
You're asking me to lie to her? - By omission...
For a few hours... You will be rewarded in heaven.
For an unbeliever, it's easy to talk about heaven.
They must be fed.
Sister...
Novice Ludwika does not care for her.
I found something for you to wear. - It's yours?
This dress I wore when I arrived here. - It's beautiful.
I was flirty.
I liked men and they liked me.
Do you ever regret?
Faith is 24 hours and the other is a minute of hope.
In the beginning I struggled with discipline.
And also with the chastity.
I know that happiness is not the goal that we pursue ...
but without the war ...
without those horrors ...
I could say that I'm happy.
You were lucky.
Not you?
I do not know.
What do you miss?
Do you want to convert me?
It's a sincere question.
No one can give really answer that.
Nobody in the outside world.
Cigarette?
I have not always been good news, but this will do you fine.
At the end of the month we leave.
The lucky ones go back to our beloved homeland.
The others, including myself, have been transferred to Berlin, the French zone.
Do not ask me why. No idea. Those are the orders.
Any questions?
Colonel ... - You're coming with me, Lehmann.
No, I was wondering if it is not too early to end the mission.
Why, you will miss it? - No, Colonel.
Are all back our wounded?
Yes. Despite the hassle with the Russian authorities, the mission is accomplished.
Satisfied? - Yes, sir.
That is bad?
This is what is wrong?
At the end of the month, we go our separate ways.
You go back to your parents ...
and I will be missing.
Maybe he cares a little ...
but I keep thinking that we will not see each other again.
We can write. - Yes of course.
A postcard surely?
What is it?
Do not like postcards?
Sorry.
I've never seen you cry. I did not know you could do that.
Tell me ... Is it because we will not see each other?
What then?
You can trust me!
Say something.
It's nothing.
Fine..Keep it to yourself. I'm going to dance.
What!
Calm down.
Mathilde Beaulieu, please. It's urgent.
Samuel, I need you.
What is going on? - Just listen.
I have not come alone.
Do not worry. I'm here to help.
This is Dr. Samuel Lehmann.
Yes, I'm Jewish! There are still a few left.
Where are the patients?
He will keep the secret.
How many doctors will let you come? - I did not know he was coming.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
We can talk for hours. There are women who are suffering and who are at risk.
I'm not baptized and I will not go to heaven, but I'm a doctor. That's all that matters.
If we are not welcome, tell us now, and we will go. You decide.
If someone had told me ...
I would ever help Polish nuns pregnant by  Russian soldiers ...
Will take this long?
They pray three times as it sounds angelus.
Calm down.
That's good.
It's not there yet.
They must continue to breathe deeply.
Come see the baby Novicia Ludwika.
Everything seems normal.
She's cute, huh?
Her name is Helen.
So I call her. She is baptized.
Her name is Helen.
You have to go.
Do you want to hold her?
Tomorrow morning I will bring her to the  Ludwika family.
And then I tell our mother the truth.
Come to my office.
Sit down.
Punish me, please, instead of Ludwika.
She did not lie, she do not even know that she has given birth.
It's completely my fault. - No.
The reason for his lie is that French
I mistrusted her from the start. She has brought shame and chaos.
Forgive me were, but shame and chaos already.
Enough!
Sister Zofia?
What happened?
I looked for her but could not find her ...
Who? - Help me, sister!
We must go!!!  Where?
Where to? - She is dying! Helena is dying!
I'll take you to her cell.
May I open the door of your Kingdom.
Give me the strength to continue on the chosen path.
Help me to carry this heavy cross.
Help me.
Here.
Do you have sugar make mother's drink?
Yes, I think I can get it. - Thank you.
Sophia!
Is everything alright?
It's not your fault.
You have done what was possible. More could not be done.
I do not know
many people who can do what you did.
Even highly educated doctors would have panicked.
Mother!
What is it? - There is somebody.
God protect.
I have very bad news.
Zofia sister is dead.
She's died yesterday. Sorry.
Oh my God!
Sorry.
Sister Zofia left them this for the baby.
What baby?
My children are already grown.
But the baby ...
Excuse me. May God protect you.
Mother, please tell me the truth.
What have you done with the child?
I had to do. - What does that mean?
I have entrusted to God. - I do not understand!
No?
Do not you believe in Divinve Providence? I do.
I believe that children were picked up by someone.
What did you do? - What could I do! Now I want to be alone.
Go away.
Sister, I think Irent is giving birth.
Just do your best
Do not be afraid.
A little bit more.
It's coming.
Continue to squeeze ...
And!
Still a bit, please.
It's coming.
Stupid. I keep thinking you will have forgotten me in a few days.
and i think I could even say the same.
You're really sentimental.
Have you been drinking? - No.
I'm just afraid you'll forget me.
We'll bet on it. Come on.
Can I borrow it?
Help me.
Tonight, I found the answer to the question that has tormented me
Which question?
I am a mother.
I will always be a mother.
He's my child. He deserves my love.
What do you mean? - I'll fill my calling differently.
God will show me the way.
I owe you so much.
I will never forget.
Thank you
I have an idea.
Sisters ...
Mother...
Just listen to us.
These children live on the streets and have no family.
You can give them shelter.
So, no one will wonder where the babies come from.
You can keep them here and raise them safely.
Sister...
But Mother Superior has already found families for all the babies. Right?
Mother, please speak.
I wanted to spare you the shame and humiliation.
I addressed myself to ruin to save you.
Murderess ...
Thank you.
Do you have a cigarette? - Here.
Thanks.
And your child?
They will take good care of it. I could not have done it.
I want to forget it all.
I want to live.
Three months later
Mother...
Can I do something for you?
Dear Mathilde. The dark clouds have disappeared
and the sun shines.
and we carry you in our hearts.
Maybe there will be war again.
New dangers threaten us.
Soon, it will be difficult to write.
But whatever may happen to us, we are ready to face it.
I know, even if this makes you laugh, that God sent you.
May He help you in all the trials and may you always find joy.
Maria.
