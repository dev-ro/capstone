Evening, ma'am.
Your ID and the vehicle's
registration, please.
I'm sorry, officer.
I left it in the dash, and I
don't have anything with me.
I just plumb forgot.
Okay, ma'am, I'll need you to
get out while we search your truck.
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What the fuck is this?
Ma'am, hands up where I can see them.
They won't hurt you as
long as you don't hurt me.
Ma'am, put your hands
on the dashboard now.
Ma'am, are you listening to me?
You got a light officer?
Hello?
What are you talking about?
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.
I have to go.
What's going on?
There's an emergency
at the detention center.
Why do they always have to
call you for these shitty jobs?
I take what they give me.
Isn't that right?
It's too much.
Ma'am, can I help you?
Yes, sir.
I'm here for the suspect that just arrived.
Here?
In the pink dress.
Oh, yeah.
This one.
Oh, thank you.
I'm going to stay behind
the door, just in case.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Evelyn Decker.
May I ask your name?
Besides the fact that smoking is
bad for your health, I must remind
you that it is quite simply
illegal to smoke on the premises.
Does it bother you?
Not really.
Oh, thank you.
Actually, I'm sorry that
you wasted your time.
I'm not sick.
I'm just tired.
I'm a psychiatrist, to be more specific.
Oh.
I'm here because my colleagues
are struggling to get a handle on you.
They don't quite know
which aisle to put you
in, so they would like
to know who you are.
They don't blame me.
But I always liked disguises.
That's what you do when you
don't really know who you are, right?
You dress up, you make
up a past to forget your own.
Is dressing up equal
lying to yourself, Doctor?
Depends.
Generally, a disguise is used to
conceal what we don't want to see.
That's interesting.
I always thought there was a
way of becoming someone else.
It'd be very pleasant to
forget yourself for a moment,
Even if you know it's only an illusion.
Are you okay?
Oh, yes.
I was just thinking.
Do you love life, Doctor?
Yes.
There are ups and downs.
My family never really had much, but
my parents always wanted the best for
me, so I was able to go to college
and make the most of my life for now.
You found love?
Yes.
I have a little boy.
He's not my soul.
I'm happy for you.
Married?
Divorced.
Life's not a long, quiet river, huh?
Yep.
Well, now that I've answered your
questions, perhaps you'll answer mine.
Oh, yes, sorry.
What was your question?
Just your name.
Doc, short for Douglas.
Nobody's called me
that for a long time now.
Do you have any children, Douglas?
Hundreds.
You're referring to your dogs?
Yes.
They're my babies.
Their love saved me a thousand times.
I owe them my life.
Would you say that you love your
dogs more than you love human beings?
Absolutely.
The more I got to know
humans, the more I love dogs.
What qualities do they
possess that humans don't have?
Dogs have beauty without vanity,
force without insolence, bravery without
ferocity, and all the virtues humans
have without any of the vices.
As far as I can tell,
they only have one flaw.
Which is?
They trust humans.
I was probably nine
when it first occurred to me.
I remember watching my
brother from my bedroom window
as he dangled meat in
front of my father's dogs.
And I watched them both starve
in the days leading to the fight.
That's how my dad earned a
living, was organizing dog fights.
Do you think that he
loved them in his own way?
No.
My father was incapable of love.
He was all violence.
How often did I tell
you not to feed the dog?
How often?
And you?
Oh, me?
I tasted his violence like everyone else.
Listening to you, I'm
struck by how calm you are.
Did you ever try to defend
yourself or complain at least?
Complaints are prayers to the devil.
Do you have any
recollections of happy times?
Yeah, sure.
When I was little, when
my mom was in the kitchen,
she used to love records
from Europe most often.
And she loved to play
them while she was cooking.
And then my dad came home.
And the show stopped.
Did you know anyone else?
A grandparent?
An aunt or uncle?
Somebody that could show
you some attention or affection?
Yes.
A child takes affection
where he can get it.
And one evening, over dinner, my
brother delightfully told my father on me.
He puts his food in his
pockets to give to the dogs later?
No.
That's a lie.
I swear.
Cross my heart.
Swear to die.
Now you love dogs, huh?
Yes.
Please.
Not at the table.
More than you love your own family?
I do.
Dogs!
Dogs!
You piece of shit!
Then he took my tears
as an admittance of guilt.
And from that day forward, I was no
longer welcome in my father's house.
Then occasionally...
This is your family now!
And your mother?
Oh, my mother, she did
the only thing she could do.
Some things for you.
You have to bury them.
If your father finds them, he'll go crazy.
I don't remember exactly what she
said, just her face was red and wet.
And she apologized.
I love you.
Have a sweet.
She was pregnant?
Yeah, seven months.
I guess she wanted to offer her child
a better life than my brother and I's.
Did you ever try to run away?
Or where?
See, on one side of the
pen was the back wall of
a kind of shed, piled
high of all kinds of stuff.
And one day, by scratching at the wood, I
was able to squeeze my tiny hands through
and found a stack of magazines that my
mom had been hiding for no obvious reason.
A little window through which
I could finally see the world.
You see, I got my whole schooling from
Modern Woman and the American Magazine.
Did you ever realize that
your situation wasn't normal?
Yeah, I did.
And how long did you stay in that cage?
Hard to tell.
Did you resent your mother
for abandoning you like that?
No.
My mother was weak.
It was her biggest flaw
and greatest stroke of luck.
In the wild, the weak are immediately
eliminated, devoured by the others.
But with humans, the weak and
cowardly always find a way to survive.
For a while, at least.
Because in the end, God
always knows his own.
One more, huh, Mommy?
Yeah.
You like that, maybe?
One more bite.
How was work?
Heavy.
So it's Dad crawling around
the neighborhood today.
He's not supposed to be in rehab?
Yes, he is.
I thought the judge forbid
him to come near the house.
Yes, she did.
He can be violent.
Yes, I know that, Mom.
Like your dad.
I know that, too.
I'm not going anywhere, baby.
You know it's your
fault Mom bailing on us.
You made Dad so unhappy
that she couldn't stand it anymore.
Being so pig-headed the whole time.
So misery all around you.
But you're just a lost sheep.
And with God's help,
Dad will get you back on the right path.
Pray and repent, young pagan.
The wages of sin is death, but the gift
of God is eternal life in Christ our Lord.
Got it?
Hi, I'm here to talk to Dogman.
This way, young man.
Don't be afraid.
They won't hurt you.
I apologize, but it's near feeding time.
The agitation is quite high.
You look oddly familiar.
Have we met?
Yeah, I, uh... I came here a few
months ago with my cousin Pablo.
We, uh, we did all the electrical.
One, right?
Yeah.
Yes.
Please, take a seat.
Something to drink?
Uh, it's okay.
I'm not really thirsty.
So what brings you here, Juan?
It's Martha.
Martha.
She very kindly delivers
my laundry from time to time.
A great woman.
Yeah.
Well, she found a little dog in the street,
you know, and she
thought... Oh, my gosh.
She thought it'd be happier
here, you know, with you.
Really?
What a little marvel.
It's an Australian labradoodle.
You know, most are imported illegally.
Many that go unsold get killed by the
dealers or tossed out the car window.
That's likely what
happened to this little guy.
He's injured his back leg.
Oh, poor thing.
Well, don't you worry.
You fell from heaven
to exactly the right place.
I'm gonna call you gorgeous.
Yes.
Be sure to thank Martha for me and tell
her if there's anything I can do, just ask.
Actually, she has a small problem.
Go ahead.
Well, there's a gang in town led by a guy.
Goes by Edward Adubo.
The executioner.
You just opened the bar
on 3rd Street, is that correct?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, what about him?
In the last few months,
he's been squeezing store
owners in our neighborhood
for protection money.
We pay up like everybody
else, but the guy, I
mean, he's just bumping
it up almost every week.
Now, Martha can't afford it.
You know, she had to sell
some of her personal furniture.
She inherited it from her folks.
Tell Martha I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.
I'll put it in his mouth.
And then I'll shit on him.
Hello?
Hello, Mr. El Vertigo.
I'm sorry to have to call you by
this name, but it's the only one I have.
Who's this?
Don't worry, I'm not with
the police department,
the feds, or any of your
other known enemies.
Under these circumstances,
in fact, I'm your only friend.
First of all, for your own good
health, I want you to sit still.
It could be very dangerous
for your future, assuming
you're thinking of
starting a family one day.
What's the matter?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Yes.
Ah, do I have your attention now?
Si.
What's your name?
Morales.
What's your first name, Mr. Morales?
Diego.
Diego?
No.
Do you like children, Diego?
Yes.
You realize you need one?
My dog has its fangs
on the half of them, yes.
Yes.
Here's the deal.
I let you have children, and in
return, you leave the delightful
Martha alone so she too can raise
her children in peace and happiness.
Who the fuck is Martha?
She's an old lady who runs the
laundry on the corner of Sixth Street.
Try taking her your dirty
clothes and not your dirty tricks.
She'll do a fabulous job on them.
How do you like my dear?
I don't get what the fuck you're saying.
I'll sum it up for you.
Quit extorting the hell out of her or my
dog gobbles your
gonads right this second.
Got it now?
Yes.
We have a deal?
We have a fucking deal.
You realize that breaking
a deal would be in complete
contradiction with your values
and mine, Mr. Morales, yes?
I see.
Wonderful.
Now give the phone
back to Mickey, please.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Don't just stand there!
Bring him back alive!
Come on, come on.
Speak softly, laugh and hold me warm against
your heart I feel your words, the tender
trembling moments dark We're in a world of our
own Sharing a love that only few have ever known.
Wine-colored days warm like the
sun The velvet night when we are one.
Speak softly, love, so no one hears us but
the sky The vows of love we made, we'll live
until we die My life is yours, and all because
You came into my world with words so softly.
Melvin, it's not me who's stopping
you from seeing your son as the
judge, and you know you're not
supposed to come near the house.
Look, can you stop, please?
You're scaring my mom.
No, I'm not bringing him to the park.
It's not good for me
and it's not good for him.
The best thing for you to do
is take care of yourself, okay?
Hello?
Melvin.
Hello?
Fuck.
Excuse me, no parking, ma'am.
All right, officer, go ahead.
Ma'am?
God.
Did you hear that from... Liam?
Did you hear back from that hole?
Need an escort officer.
Thank you.
I was allowed to go to your house to
bring you some things, as you asked.
Thank you.
It was pretty messy at your place.
Yes, I'm usually very tidy.
You need some help?
Caramel latte with whipped cream, right?
Perfect, thank you.
No, I shouldn't.
Sugar's bad for me.
Cutting out all of life's little pleasures
is even worse, don't you think?
Must be exhausted.
You only got a few hours sleep.
A good coffee and I'm ready for anything.
Anyway, your story is very fascinating, and I
still have no news on when and where they're gonna
transfer you, so I would love to ask you a few more
questions about your childhood, if you don't mind.
Well, it's a bit late for
that, don't you think?
Meaning?
To train an animal well, the
earlier you start, the better.
I'm too old to be
retrained, don't you think?
Do you find talking about your
childhood awkward or uncomfortable?
No.
I'm just not used to it.
Actually, it feels like it
probably does me some good.
No one exists without a past, right?
Well, they say the past is
the root that becomes the tree.
True, but roots are invisible.
Why dig them up?
Because it does you good.
Touche.
So what do you want to know?
How did you get out of that cage?
I see them!
Look at this.
Oh, this is great.
Wait and see what Dad's gonna
do to your puppies when he finds out.
He'll make dog food out of them.
Richie, please.
Don't do that.
Or else?
Don't do that, Richie.
Richie, please.
My brother, Richie,
betrayed me once again,
went into the house and told my father.
My father was a sick man.
He hated the world, starting with himself.
He didn't love life.
He tried to constantly destroy it.
Move.
No, no.
No, please.
Please.
Move.
I have enough.
I said move.
Move, or I'll get you.
Get the hell out of the way!
Move away!
Move away!
I came out with a shotgun to
prove some kind of point and I
wouldn't get out of the way, the
gun went off and I lost a finger.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Dad, Dad, Dad!
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
No, stop, stop.
I got this, I got this, I got this.
Let's go inside, let's go inside.
You didn't do anything,
it's not your fault, okay?
Come on, come on.
No, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, listen to me.
Go inside, come on, come on.
It's okay, I got this.
It's not your fault, go inside.
Come on, come on.
I got this, okay?
You see?
You refuse to understand.
You refuse to accept the error of your
ways, and you behave like an animal!
You do not deserve
God's love, only his mercy.
Amen.
Moby, you see this?
Car.
I want you to find
them and give them this.
The police car.
You got that?
The car in the back.
Go, Moby.
Go, Moby.
Whoa, chicken mutt.
What's up, little fella?
He looks like he's trying
to tell us something.
Is it one of your informers?
Very funny.
I'm going straight up to the second floor.
You cover me on the stairs, all right?
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go upstairs.
Let's go.
Jesus.
We're gonna need backup.
Ambulance and social services.
Come on, let's go.
It's done.
Don't move.
Hands off the gun now!
Get the police!
Put your hands on your head!
That might have been the best day of
my life if by unfortunate coincidence the
bullet hadn't ricocheted off the wall
and launched itself into my spinal cord.
I was free at last, but God had
deprived me of legs to enjoy my freedom.
I do believe in God,
But I think at that point
in my life, the question
I asked myself was,
did God believe in me?
I see you are fitted with
a system of leg braces.
Can you walk?
A bit.
They allow me to take
steps in emergencies.
But the bullet was in a
very delicate position.
And right or wrong, the doctors
didn't want to risk taking it out.
So with every step I take, there's
a chance of my bone marrow
emptying out to the body,
which is not highly recommended.
I can walk, but only to my death.
Very Shakespearean, don't you think?
And your father and your
brother, how long did they get?
Father got 20.
Killed himself two weeks after his arrest.
I guess he didn't have
my capacity for cage life.
And your brother?
My brother got 12.
Thanks to God and good
behavior, he only served eight.
Did you ever see him again?
Yes, I did.
The day he was released.
These papers?
Get out of here.
They let him out in the
morning, and one of my more
diligent docs, Paulie,
was there waiting for him.
♪ Rumors spreadin' round ♪ ♪
And I had to take the time ♪ ♪ To
find a shack outside the game
♪ You know what I'm talkin' about.
♪ Just let me know if you
wanna go ♪ ♪ To that whole mile
on the range ♪ They got
a lot of nice girls out here.
Your dogs killed your brother.
No.
God, in his great wisdom,
put him out of his misery.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thank you.
Mind if I have a bite to eat?
Please do.
It's not exactly good,
but my appetite's back.
I don't know, maybe it has
something to do with your presence.
That's good.
But as a matter of
procedure, I must tell you
that our conversations
are being recorded.
There's a camera on the ceiling.
Two, actually.
I know.
You want one?
No, thank you.
I see here that, uh, after you
were discharged from the hospital,
You were sent to a care
home, the first of several I see.
Do you have any
recollection of that time?
I swapped out one prison for another,
more spacious and comfortable,
sure, but without my dogs,
my isolation was even greater.
You didn't make any friends?
No.
Dogs have a real sense of family.
Even when they come from
different breeds, they rally
around in the bad times
and form a solid, united entity.
The kids I met in the
homes were already scarred
and beaten by life, incapable of uniting.
They only listened to
their survival instincts.
When you see dogs love their
friends and bite their enemies,
quite unlike people, you
always have to mix love and hate.
You ever have any
romantic relationships?
That's not true.
There was one, actually.
Selma.
Hello.
Douglas, right?
I'm Selma.
The librarian tells me
you're a great reader.
Have you read this before?
Do you know Shakespeare?
Oh, my God, I'm about
to change your world.
Shakespeare is the
greatest writer of all time.
You can imagine, all these
playwrights are inspired
by this man that wrote
plays 400 years ago.
And the best one, in
my opinion, is Macbeth.
She was a counselor,
taught a drama class.
As beautiful as the sunbeams, she
could talk about
Shakespeare like nobody.
She taught me how to put on makeup.
She said that if you didn't like your
reflection, you just had to change it.
You know, nothing
proves that the reflection
in the mirror is fake and we are real.
Maybe the reflection is convinced
that it is reality and we simply copy.
I've never met anyone like her.
Okay, your turn.
Moustache.
I can't.
Of course you can.
You can do anything you want.
You can be a king or a prince.
You can be a beggar or a flower.
Anything you choose.
Okay, okay.
She said the theater was
like a religion, a proposition
that the true believer
experiences as reality.
And remember, if you can play
Shakespeare, you can play anything.
As in truth I speak to you
as if from some high hill.
True, and you kill me from that high part,
that one harsh word fall upon my heart.
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred
words of my tongue's utterings yet.
I know the sound.
Art thou not Romeo and Montague?
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
My dearest love, Duncan
comes here tonight.
And when goes hence?
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
Oh, never shall some admirer see.
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Hamlet, you have offended your father.
Mother, you have offended my father.
You may indeed say so, for it was
that hand that gave away my heart.
A liberal hand.
The hearts of all gave hands.
But I know heraldry is hands, not hearts.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I written, I would tear the word.
Ramia.
Let all those who love me follow me!
When I was alive at last, I could
fully express myself, my whole body.
I was what I wanted to
be, and the barriers of
reality were dismantled
by makeup and verse.
You see, while the real
world constantly rejected me,
the imaginary one opened its
arms and welcomed me fully.
And in this new kingdom,
Selma was my princess.
You loved her?
Madly.
Did you tell her?
I was getting ready
to, but one day she left.
The theater group in
Boston suburbs had hired her.
I was happy for her.
Her talent deserved far better
than a home for juvenile delinquents.
That's for sure.
Did you lose track of her?
I followed her every step.
She struggled to begin with.
But Selma had too much
talent and love not to succeed.
Very soon, she started working
with more professional outfits,
and within a few years, she
worked her way up to Broadway.
And eventually, I was able to
get the courage to go and see her.
She was beautiful.
And I asked one of
the security guards if I
could go backstage, and he let me come.
Come in.
Sorry to bother you, Selma.
There's someone here.
Says he's your number one fan.
He knows you, and can he say hi?
Sure.
I was absolutely terrified that
she wouldn't remember me.
But she did.
Instantly.
Oh, my gosh.
Douglas!
Douglas!
I'm one of yours!
Look how you've grown!
Are you kidding?
Look at this outfit!
Decked out like a prince!
I wanted to throw these to you at the
end, but I was scared for my position.
They wouldn't hit the stage.
They're beautiful.
Come on, let's go get them in a vase.
This is amazing.
I was only thinking about you the other
day, wondering what happened to you.
I'm warning you, I want the full story.
Shoot.
Okay.
Well, I kept reading.
That could be what I do best.
Then I passed a number of exams.
I did a college course.
Ah, fantastico.
You must have made friends there.
No, it was an online course.
The campus was too far
from the home I was in.
I only went once a
month for exams and stuff,
but it didn't stop me
from getting my B.S.C.
in biology.
A B.S.C.?
That's really good.
What was your dissertation about?
Dogs.
Ah.
I should have guessed.
You were always talking
about them back then.
Look, they're beautiful.
Not as beautiful as you.
So sweet.
And acting, you kept up with it?
A bit.
It's not really the same
without you, though.
I hope so.
But I followed your
career from the beginning.
Really?
Look, I cut out every article I could find
since your very first
production in Boston.
You did this?
For you.
You like it?
This is the most beautiful gift
anyone has given me in a long time.
And she seemed genuinely
happy that I was there.
Come in.
What a show.
Ah, thank you.
They loved it.
Thank you.
Douglas, this is Bradley, my director,
who also happens to be my husband.
Hey, Doug.
I heard a lot about you, man.
Cool.
He's also the future daddy of my baby.
Douglas.
Congratulations.
How long have you been...
Two weeks.
Really?
That's fast.
You're already pregnant.
You mean Bradley?
No, we met three years
ago and took our time getting
to know each other and
got married last winter.
And the baby really is new.
You're one of the first to know.
I haven't even told my family yet.
I'm... I'm flattered.
Look, babe, Douglas made this for me.
Really?
He kept every article
about me since I started out.
Wow.
Isn't it adorable?
It's beautiful.
That's true artistry, man.
Wow, wow, wow.
So you're a member of the Klan, right?
You're in the artistic family?
You're in the show business?
No.
I'm in the dog business.
So that evening, I
went back to the shelter
where I'd been working
for the past five years.
I felt so, so stupid.
And she was older,
gorgeous, and successful.
I was just this guy in a
wheelchair who, even if
he could walk, I would
have no idea where to go.
How could I think for one second
that she felt anything but pity for me?
No!
Their love for me was so genuine, true,
pure, without any trickery or pretense.
Dogs never lie when they talk about love.
What happened next?
I adapt.
Again.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
You want to shut down the shelter?
The state is running a
huge deficit and the new
governor has launched a
drastic cost-cutting program.
Funding to your organization
has been stopped.
The funding I receive has been cut in half
every year for the last three years, but
thanks to donations and regularly placing
dogs, we cost the state next to nothing.
You have done remarkable work.
We fully understand
that, but we have received
numerous complaints for
various kinds of nuisance.
Oh, nuisance such as?
Such as odors.
City Hall have decided to
sell the land to a developer.
Oh, so it's all about money.
We're just carrying
out orders, you know?
Yes, I know.
And what happens to the dogs?
We release them and ask them
kindly to go back to their families.
I guess they'll be taken
to a more suitable facility.
I know what that's like.
Going from home to home and never
getting a shot at rebuilding your life.
Your record here is beyond reproach.
I am sure social services will
soon find you another position.
So when's the big day?
In theory, Monday morning, 6 a.m.
We can ask them for
more time if you like.
Get you an extension.
Thank you, though.
I'll see you on Monday.
Okay, uh, Monday.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Firstly, we bring out the manager.
The guy's in a wheelchair.
It's a bit of an oddball.
And we take care of the dogs.
Understood.
What the fuck?
We'll be okay here.
Polly, tell the others, okay?
Call me beloved, and I'll be your baptist.
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
What man art thou that's bescreened
in night so stumblest on my counsel?
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.
What's in a name that
which we call a rose?
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he
not Romeo called, retain that
dear perfection which
he owes without that title.
Romeo, doff thy name, and for thy name,
which is no part of thee, take all myself.
I take thee at thy word.
Call me but love, and
I'll be new baptized.
Henceforth, I never will be Romeo.
Did you ever see Selma again?
No.
She had two children
in quick succession.
She quit acting.
Her husband turned to beer.
Even the stars fade
and go out in the end.
The place where you were
living, it was pretty well-equipped.
How did you do that?
I help people.
People help me back.
Yes, but it must have
cost a lot of money, right?
True.
To begin with, it was difficult.
I had to pick up a job.
But I had trouble finding one.
My biology degree couldn't even
open the doors to a fast food restaurant.
Oh, but you don't smell
the flowers, do you?
It's my flowers.
I pay for them.
Sweet dreams are made of this.
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas.
Sorry, we don't have anything right now.
Let's go back.
Everybody is looking for something.
Some of them want it.
Bye.
You're heaven.
I travel the world and the seven seas.
Everybody's looking for something.
Sweet dreams are made of this.
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas.
Everybody's looking for something.
Beautiful, Annie.
Beautiful.
Thank you, Annie.
Cher, you were on just after this
number and before the magician.
This is to my favor.
Oh.
Um... Rodney?
Yes?
I came about the ad at the door.
Sorry, I'm... Oh, the bar job.
We found someone.
I'm sorry.
I forgot to take the ad off the door.
I'm sorry.
Have a good day.
Actually, I was thinking
maybe another job.
I'm an artist, too, you see.
You mean, like, do an act?
I know all of Shakespeare by heart.
Kid, you're in the wrong theater.
This is a drag show.
No, I understand, but I'm... If you can
perform Shakespeare,
you can perform anything.
I also know a whole repertoire of old
songs, so I have that to offer as well.
I'm sure you can't perform, but get this.
Folks come here to have fun, not to
watch some cross-dresser
in a wheelchair.
I can stand.
For one song.
Rodney, come on.
Give him a chance.
Just give him a little one.
He stood.
Come on, Rodney, please.
Oh, for me.
No, he stood.
Come on.
Look at him.
Yes.
One night.
Yes.
Does he love me?
I want to know.
How will I know if he loves me?
So is it in his eyes?
Oh, no, you'll be deceived.
Is it in his smile?
Oh, no, you'll never believe it.
The big reveal.
Girls, the crowd tonight
is a little quiet, so if we
could just bring up the
energy, that'd be perfect.
Cher?
Huh?
Could you shut up for a second?
Wow.
Rude.
Douglas, you're on in two minutes.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
I thought you couldn't
walk without those.
I can't.
But I can stand still... for a moment.
Just don't leave me
over there at the end.
No, of course not.
As soon as the song is over.
I need you to be there to pick me up.
Promise me.
I promise you I'll be there.
Give it up for our fantastic magician.
Wasn't he incredible?
Unfortunately, though, our
magician will be taking a short
sabbatical after the teeniest
and tiniest of incidents.
Just relax.
Just relax.
Just relax.
Next up for you, we have
something you've never seen before.
A completely new kind of... Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
One, two... Okay.
We'll be right here.
Okay.
Good luck.
Now, without further
ado, let me welcome to the
stage the French diva
herself, Miss Edith Piaf!
Oh, my God.
My words as well.
Je revois la ville en fête et en délire Suffoquant sous le soleil et sous la joie Et
j'entends dans la musique les cris et les rires Qui éclatent et rebondissent autour de
moi Et perdu parmi ces gens qui me pousculent Et tout dit, désemparé, je reste là
Quand soudain je me retourne, ils se reculent Et la foule vient me jeter entre ses bras.
Emportés par la foule qui nous
traîne, nous entraîne, écrasés
I'un contre I'autre, nous
ne formons qu'un seul corps.
Et le flot, sans effort, nous
pousse à enchaîner I'un et
I'autre, et nous laisse tous deux
épanouis, enivrés et heureux.
Entraînés par la foule qui s'élance et qui danse Une
folle par en dehors de nos deux mains reste soudée.
Et parfois soulevés, nos deux corps enlacés
s'envolent Et retombent tous deux épanouis en y briser.
Et la joie que I'a poussée par son sourire Me
transperce et rejaillit au fond de mon âme Mais
soudain je poussais un cri parmi les rires Quand
la foule vient I'arracher d'entendre mes bras.
Emportée par la foule qui
nous traîne, nous entraîne,
nous éloigne I'un de I'autre,
je lutte et je me débarque.
Mais le son de ma voix
s'écouffe dans le rire des autres
et je crie de douleur, de
fureur et de rage et je pleure.
The garden!
Close the curtain.
Douglas, come here.
Come here, please.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
This is why you don't trust the garden.
So, you were a hit?
Well, let's not exaggerate.
I was sufficiently convincing for the boss
to hire me once a
week, every Friday night.
I have to admit, I couldn't
wait for Friday to come around.
It was my only moment
where my reflection
succeeded in making
me forget my image.
So, the show was your
only source of income?
No.
I was a kind of matchmaker.
I'd study the profile of the client and
suggest companions
that had similar interests.
Your main activity was
placing dogs in homes with
people who were looking
to break their solitude?
Yeah, mostly.
Mostly?
What does that mean?
I also offered protection services.
And how big were these protection
services in your business plan?
People want to be loved and protected.
That's all anybody's
praying for all day long.
But I'm guessing the pay
was nowhere near enough.
You still needed money to
rebuild and look after your dogs.
Well, the answer came
from my dogs, actually.
How?
What do you mean?
Not only were they my
best friends, my most faithful
companions, but they
also understood everything.
Absolutely everything I told them.
Plain flour?
Thank you.
I'm gonna need...
250 grams unsalted butter.
Thank you.
And two large eggs.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Be a darling and fetch me some sugar.
We're gonna make a very nice cake.
I believe in the redistribution of wealth.
Do you know that the 100 richest
people are richer
than the poorest billion?
Yes, I do.
It's outrageous, but that doesn't mean
that your actions are not against the law.
Laws are written by the
rich to control the poor.
It should be the other way
around, don't you think?
You're right.
But that doesn't mean
you get to be judge and jury.
I suppose you're right.
I plead guilty.
If you were earning a living,
why continue stealing like that?
For the kicks?
No.
Far from it.
I think that when society rejects a
child, makes them an outcast, they take
everything that was never given to them as
a way of making amends for the injustice.
Don't you think your explanation
is just a play on words?
I mean, a delinquent
is a delinquent, right?
Nobody is born a delinquent.
You become one through circumstance.
God had wanted he could have made
me a pianist, a florist, or a doctor, even.
Why didn't he?
Looking after dogs is just
as good of a profession
as any other while I
continue the home invasions.
I stopped.
A few months ago.
What made you do that?
A chance encounter.
Miss you.
Ackerman.
Insurance.
Right this way.
Sir.
Morning, ma'am.
Ackerman.
I'll be your claims adjuster for today.
Thank you for agreeing to see me.
Please take a seat.
OK.
So what do you want to know?
Just, you know, tell me
the whole story, I guess.
Well, we came back
from the United Nations
gala around 1 o'clock in the morning.
I took off my necklace, put it
on the dresser, as I always do.
Oh, not in the safe?
Because I do believe
that you have a safe, right?
No, I was far too tired
to come back down here.
I see.
And the staff?
What about the staff?
Have they all left?
Oh, long gone.
I locked the front door myself.
The dogs, you didn't hear
the dogs bark last night?
No, not at all.
I'm a very light sleeper, too.
I would have heard them.
Was the window open?
All the windows are tight shut.
Well, except for one in the bathroom, but
it's far too small for
anyone to get through.
Hmm.
I see.
And, uh, what time did you
realize the necklace was missing?
When I woke up at 7
o'clock the next morning.
So... Okay, so let me get this straight.
So the jewelry vanished
sometime between the hours of 1
and 7 in the morning from a
locked house with you in it?
Exactly.
Now, if you think that I'm making
this whole story up to cash in for
the insurance... Well, far be it for
me to suggest otherwise, ma'am.
Your reputation speaks for
itself, but you have to admit
it's a, you know, it's a
tricky equation to square.
Well, isn't that why you're here?
Yes, indeed.
As requested, the footage
from the security cameras.
There are 12 cameras
all around this house.
None inside?
No.
We appreciate our privacy.
Ma'am.
Que reste-t-il de nos amours?
Que reste-t-il de ces beaux jours?
Une photo, vieille photo,
De ma jeunesse Que reste-t-il
Des billets doux Des mois d'avril Des
rendez-vous sans fin Le pour suit sans
cesse Honneur affané Cheveux au vent
1.04 a.m.
A woman arrives home, and nothing till
7 in the morning when the maids arrive.
Whoa, whoa.
Back it up a fraction.
Back it up.
What are they doing?
Looks like they're greeting someone.
What's that?
Yeah, a stray dog enters
the property, they play
for about five minutes,
and then it takes off.
Go forward.
Go frame by frame.
Forward, forward.
Right there.
There, the dog.
See, it's got the necklace.
The dog's got the necklace.
It's hard to say for sure.
Could be its ID tag.
You get the tapes from last month,
the burglary on Virginia Street?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Why don't you go get him, Jerry?
There.
Go back.
Back, back, back, back.
See?
What did I tell you?
There's another dog.
There's a dog right there.
It's tough to call, sir.
Could be a fox.
They have a chicken run in the backyard.
Oh, is that what you think, Jerry?
Why don't you go get the
tapes related to similar cases?
Now, Jerry.
Yeah.
Right there.
See right there?
See that?
Keep going.
Keep trying.
There.
Oh, shit.
See?
Aha!
This, my friend, this
is the work of an artist.
Outside the barracks, by the
corner light I'll always stand
and wait for you at night
We will create a world for two
I'll wait for you the whole night through.
For you, Lily Marley.
For you, Lily Marley.
Bugler tonight, don't
play the call to watch.
I want another evening with a chance.
Then we will say goodbye and pass.
I'll always keep you in my heart.
With me, Lily Marley.
With me, Lily Marley.
Give me a rose to show
how much you care.
Tie to the stem a lock of golden hair.
Surely tomorrow.
You'll feel blue, but then
will come a love that's new.
For you, Lily Marley.
For you, Lily Marley.
It's you, Lily Marley.
You were so good.
It was so good.
You looked fantastic.
You looked beautiful.
I am so proud of you.
Girls, are you decent?
Good.
Marlena, darling, you
have a gentleman caller.
She's got fans now.
Hello.
Hi.
Sorry.
I just wanted to congratulate you.
Wow.
That was awesome.
I'm a total fan.
Thank you.
Yeah.
May I?
Sorry.
May I?
Yeah.
My mother's family came from Germany,
so I know all those songs by heart.
And believe me when I say
you gave a magnificent rendition.
Well, coming from a specialist, I
appreciate the compliment even more.
Perform every night?
No, once a week.
Oh, good call.
Yeah, you know, the rarer
something is, the greater its value.
It's true.
Which night?
Friday.
Now you know where to
find me every Friday night.
Look, I know this is
rather, uh, bold, but...
May I invite you to dinner with me?
I'm just dying to get to know you.
You already know the
best part of me, darling.
The rest isn't worth wasting your time on.
Ah, you are much too
modest, like all true artistes.
I don't know what you do for a living,
sir, but you'd make
one hell of a salesman.
I work in insurance.
That makes sense.
They're the worst.
When you're right, you're right.
You are so right.
But, you know, under
the suit, there's a man.
A man worth getting to know.
I'm sure.
Or worth getting dinner with, at least.
Come on.
Have dinner with me.
I know you want to have dinner with me.
That's very sweet of you.
And I appreciate the offer.
But I need to get home.
I have my children to feed.
I hope you understand.
Well, apologies if I
came on a little strong.
No, not at all.
But I will see you next Friday?
With pleasure.
Yeah.
Whoa.
It's just, you just, you made my night.
What was that?
Oh, my God.
Is it real?
Yes.
How often does that happen to you?
Well, quite often.
You sure you got the right address?
It's just a shortcut.
I just need a little fresh air.
Think you could help
me with my chair, please?
Sure.
Thank you.
Hey, what's up?
Okay, good luck.
Kids, get ready.
We have company.
Well, I admire your persistence, sir.
This is verging on harassment.
I could sue for this.
Oh, be my guest, pal.
I'll tell the court about your dogs
that you trained to steal from houses.
My dogs are as free as
the air you breathe, sir.
They've received no particular
training from me, I assure you.
I have several dozen videos
that prove the opposite,
and some of the protagonists
live in this very room.
I also have a list of all the
valuables that were stolen,
jewelry mostly, which you have
no hesitation flaunting on stage.
That's cute, but I don't steal.
I contribute to the
redistribution of wealth.
Very different things.
Fine by me, but let's
redistribute it differently.
Okay?
If you don't mind.
Oh, so it's all about money.
Uh, yes!
It's all about money!
Money, money, money.
Always sunny in the... Honey, whatever
the fuck you are, the show is over, okay?
You're gonna hand
over the rocks that you
must have stashed
somewhere in all this mess.
Do not try telling me that they're in a
bank, because you have zero accounts.
I checked.
Hmm?
Don't fuck with me.
Give me the fucking rocks.
I really do not want
to shoot a handicapped
person today, but I fucking will.
70, 80, what is that?
What are these numbers?
It's my vital statistics
and the combination
to the safe over there in the closet.
Oh, fuck yes.
Now that you're a rich man, I'd be
happy to accept your dinner invitation.
Take a seat.
Dinner will be ready in two minutes.
You want to have dinner with me?
Sure.
Why wouldn't I?
I mean, to be completely honest,
it's not very often that I get visitors.
Besides, money has never been
what drives me, and all those necklaces
would definitely get more use
around the necks of pretty ladies.
You're insane.
Thank you.
Take a seat.
Do you like chili?
Well, you know, it depends.
My mother used to make it all the time.
I used to love watching her cook.
To be honest, I'm so
hungry I could eat a horse.
That's lucky.
It's ready.
You are aware that we're talking
about a serious criminal act here, right?
Dog eat dog.
It's just a simple law of nature, isn't it?
You know, my profession
demands the strictest
confidentiality with
regards to our discussions.
Should I, however, be witness even
indirectly to a criminal act that resulted
in a death, I am legally obligated to
report any information that I may have.
I'll plead self-defense.
You risk the death penalty.
You realize that?
I've already died several times.
This one could be the last.
Well, if it's God's will.
At the end of the day, I'm just a
puppet at the end of his strings.
No, you're not.
Things happen in life
true, and most of the
time, there's nothing you can do about it.
Ultimately, it's our reaction
that matters the most.
I mean, you can be sad.
You can be desperate.
You could fight or you
could laugh about it.
It's really up to you.
It's your decision.
No one else's.
It's called free will.
God invented it.
How often did this type
of situation happen?
Which kind of situation?
Killing a man.
Oh.
No, not until yesterday.
What happened yesterday?
God sent his angels of the apocalypse.
I want to be loved by you, just you.
Nobody else but you.
I wanna be loved by you alone.
I wanna be kissed by you just you.
Nobody else but you.
I wanna be kissed by you alone.
No!
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please!
I wanna be loved by you alone.
Are you sure he lives here?
Yes, yes, yes, I swear to God.
There's a red cat there
at the end of the hallway.
There's dogs.
Okay, I believe you.
Now, find me this motherfucker.
Come on, let's go.
Time for war, everyone.
What's up?
The fucking door.
Go check, go check.
Mierda.
Go around, go around.
Damn!
Okay, yo por aqui.
Tu por alla.
Okay, okay.
Vamos.
This is it.
Oh.
Damn! Are you okay?
Are you okay? Damn! Are you okay?
Damn! Are you okay?
Rico!
Bring in the artillery.
Ah, shit.
It's over, kid.
We had a deal.
I thought we had a deal!
But as we've known
for so long, these are just
sentiments that lead
to a person's downfall.
You're the devil.
I'm sending you back to hell.
If it's God's will.
I guess God is not on your side today.
Cheers.
Thank you.
That's a cute lighter.
Will I keep it?
Sure.
Thank you.
It's ridiculous.
Are all those dogs yours?
Yes, they're my babies.
I don't know what they're
going to do with them.
Don't worry.
They know exactly what to do.
I think I've asked enough
questions for today.
I'm gonna take some
time and process all of this
and figure out how I
can... how I can help you.
That's very sweet of you.
And you've already
helped me a lot, actually.
You're right.
I need to make a decision about my life.
Perhaps I have to pay the ultimate
price to earn the right to be by his side.
Today is Sunday.
It's the Lord's day.
The right day to ask him this question.
Thank you, Doctor.
Evelyn.
Thank you, Evelyn.
Can I ask you one more question?
Sure.
What made you open up to me?
We both have something in common.
Yeah, what's that?
Pain.
Are you done?
Yes.
I'm done.
No, no, no.
Go, go, go!
Hey, guys.
