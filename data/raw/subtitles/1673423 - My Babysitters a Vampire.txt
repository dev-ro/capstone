[Thunder and lightning strikes]
I love you.
- I'm not human.
- I don't care.
Bite me. I'm begging you.
[Screaming on TV]
Look at all this!
What'd you do, rob an ice cream
truck or something?
Tomorrow we officially join
the high school brotherhood.
We are men.
We must mark the moment.
Let's make it the Sunday
to end all Sundays.
Remember grade five when you put
176 of these in your mouth?
- Yeah, right! It was 186!
- No way.
I did 172; you did 176.
You barely hit 150!
- I got it.   - No, mine.
- Mine. Mine.
Remember to count them.
[Thumping sound]
Hey, Ethan.
Do you hear that?
[Muffled counting]
Teenagers really are dumb.
We're tied, okay?
[Muffled speech]
No.
[Loud thud]
[Loud thud]
What are you doing?
What's it look like
I'm doing?
Trespassing.
Why don't you make like an egg
and beat it?
I'm going to tell
my big brother.
Really? I'm so scared!
Pfft. I've seen your brother.
He might be older,
but he's not big.
Fetch.
Abbey!
[Screaming]
Honey? Honey?
What's wrong? Are you hurt?
What are you doing outside?
Ethan!
Hey.
You're home early.
How was date night?
Okay, sweetheart?

[School bell rings]
A babysitter? For you?
Classic!
Shh! Keep it down, man.
This kind of info could
totally ruin a guy's rep.
And it's not for me;
It's for Jane.
Well, on the positive side, one
of these primo high school babes
could totally be
at your house tonight.
Hey, hot stuff.
- Dude!
- What?
All I know is
her name is Erica
and she goes to this school.
With any luck, I can talk
my parents out of it by tonight.
Ah, hey! Principal Hicks,
let me give you a hand.
Oh, thank you, Jesse.
Much better.
Anything for our fearless
leader. Do you mind?
Ah, French roast.
French roast...
- Good choice.
- Good choice...
[Chuckling]
Boys in the drama club,
always making a scene, ha-ha-ha.
[Chuckling]
Benny, this is it.
Our whole future social lives
could depend...
...on how we behave
here the next few days, so—
- What do you think?
- Benny!
Those are state of the art
alien DNA detector goggles!
Yeah, so?
High school cafeteria is
an ideal place to test them out!
Yeah, and to brand us as dorks
for the next four years!
- Just give me the goggles.
- No. You promise to be cool?
- OK, I will—
- Hey! You guys, hey! Over here.
Oh, no...
The three amigos ride again.
Any of you guys got a buck 28?
Ugh... Okay, that's it.
I'm getting away from you guys
- or I'm doomed to be—
- Ah! Dork!
Thank you so much!
That is one babe-tastic
tower of Babe-alon.
I'm AB positive
you will be mine.
Drinking your hemoglobin
may be a crime...
...but our love will sparkle
for all time.
Sarah. Wait up!
Where have you been?
I've been texting you
all morning.
Oh! What happened
to your shirt?
- Ugh. Don't ask.
- Okay, guess what?
I already have 200 tickets
sold for the screening.
Only seven more days.
I seriously think if I had
to wait eight more days
instead of seven more days,
I would go crazy.
Yeah. Me too...
You skipped math today.
Were you with Jesse?
Yes.
If I had a cute boyfriend,
I'd totally skip class too.
What? I would!
Do you think you're the only one
who's allowed to break the rules?
- No, but you're a good girl.
- So are you.
I don't know anymore.
Straight A's,
always nice to everyone.
Trust me, you are.
Anyways, I saved you two seats.
- Jesse's coming, right?
- No, he's not a real Dusk fan.
What? How can you date someone
who doesn't like Dusk?
- The second book changed my life.
- Yeah, I know.
No way. That babe you branded
is friends with her?
Who?
Stage one Dusker girl?
Her name is Erica, and she's the
Princess Leia to my Han Solo.
Hey, maybe she's your babysitter
for tonight.
Okay, first,
in no universe
are you Han.
I doubt
it's the same Erica.
Ah, you're right.
Probably too good to be true.
- I'm going to go find out.
- Wait, what? Benny? Benny!
Way to go, Benny!
Shut up!
Hi there. Are you by any chance
babysitting the Morgans tonight?
Yeah. Why, do you know
their kids?
Yeah, one of them is my buddy,
sitting right over... there.
He's a bit shy.
See you around.
Yes!
- [Boy]: Think she'll tuck you in tonight?
- Shut up!
- Yeah! I think she likes me.
- What? Why?
You're being babysat by a Dusker.
Diehard fans of Dusk are so lame.
Yeah, you should talk.
You still sleep with
Starship Enterprise jammies.
Dusk is based on fairytale creatures;
Star Trek is based on actual physics.
True... but, hey,
if fairytales is what it takes
to nab my future wife,
then, once upon a time, I'm in!
Hey, check it out:
Looks like they found the rest
of that missing senior.
- The rest?
- Yeah, says here he was all shriveled up.
You know, kind of like
this juice box.
- I am so sorry. I didn't—
- Dude!
Oh, bummer.
Looks like she's already hooked
up with Mr. Too-Cool-For-School.
Did somebody mention my name?
...don't be ridiculous.
Well, it's too late
to turn back now!
Jesse, Sarah said you weren't
a big fan of vampire movies?
I love vampires.
That's exactly
what I told her.
- Yeah, well I gotta go.
- Okay. Well...
I'll see you around.
Dusk forever!
There's something not right
about that drama club.
Hope we all see you
at the screening.
I am so going
to your house tonight.
Great... The more
"mathletes," the merrier.
- Can I come?
- [Ethan and Benny]: No.
Watch it, nerds!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
It must be pretty embarrassing
needing a babysitter in high school.
Howdy pardners.
Ain't she purdy as a 20 dollar
bill in a 10 gallon hat?
Oh, well,
thank you, kind sir.
We're going country
line-dancing.
Yeah, I kind of noticed.
Um, Mom? Dad?
I just want to say...
you were right.
I shouldn't have left Jane
untended last week.
I learned my lesson.
So, you can cancel the sitter
and save 25 dollars.
Ethan, I already told you, I'm not
going to leave you alone with Jane
until I know
you can be trusted.
Sorry, pal.
She's the sheriff.
Fine!
I'll be in my room.
Alone.
Hey, man. Any sign
of the babe-o-sitter yet?
No. I'm staying in my room
as a form of protest.
Well, I'm not!
First sign of Babezilla
approaching, and I am there.
Good luck with that.
[TV]: You killed my BFF!
[Sighs]
She should be here.
[Crickets chirping]
[Rustling]
[Squawking]
Hey.
[Erica gasps]
Sarah, oh, my gosh,
you scared me.
I wanted to apologize.
I haven't been the greatest
friend lately.
Yeah. I miss hanging out
with you.
You don't even text me
anymore.
Things are kind of weird
right now. I can't really—
No, it's okay. I got it.
I'm not cool enough for you
since you started dating Jesse.
No, that's not it at all,
I swear.
Then what? We're supposed
to be organizing
this fan club screening
together.
I know. My life's just
really complicated right now.
This is the one we get to find
out if he bites her or not!
I know,
but it is just a movie.
[Gasps]
"Just a movie"?
Oh, my gosh.
Who are you?!
I have to go.
I have a babysitting job.
I will see you around,
Dusk abandoner.
Erica!
Okay, fine. You're right,
it is because of Jesse,
but it's not how you think.
Well, speak of the devil.
- Hello again.
- Hello... again.
You're not...
avoiding me, are you?
Oh, she's avoiding
a lot of people.
Come on,
what are you afraid of?
I just...
I need some more time.
Tick... tock...
Time's up.
[Gust of wind]
[TV]: Aren't you scared
my dad will catch us?
You make me brave.
He'll kill you
if he finds out.
- Hm?
- Oh... right.
So, anyway, listen.
There's this monster party
at Jesse's later,
and if Sarah is not interested,
maybe you'd like
to hang out with us.
But she can't;
She's babysitting.
No, I'm not.
Count me in.
- Erica, no!
- I am allowed to break the rules, too.
And he's really cute.
You don't understand!
Okay, the rest of you,
go on ahead. Sarah and I
need to have a little talk.
You said I could choose, Jesse.
You said it was up to me!
It is. But, hey, some
decisions need a little push.
[Sharp slap]
[He chuckles]
Come on, Sarah.
Can't you feel it? Your body
knows what it wants.
Lucky for me,
I think with my brain.
You're not going anywhere.
[Animal-like grunting
and growling]
Hmm...
You hear that?
It sounds like ultimate raccoon
fighting in our back yards!
Sounds huge!
Why fight it, Sarah?
You're the one who said
you liked vampires.
I never said
I wanted to be one!
[Deepened voice]: You
shouldn't have done that.
[Sarah yelling]
[Loud thump]
Sounds like
part of a tree hit the house.
[Doorbell rings]
Oh, honey, I've got it.
- All right.
- Finally.
Hi. You must be Erica,
the babysitter?
Uh, what? Uh, no,
uh, she's sick so she sent me.
Uh, I'm Sarah.
Can I come in? Please?
Of... course.
Jane?
Your babysitter's here.

Oh, hang on a second, honey.
You're bleeding.
Oh, it's nothing.
I tripped on the way here.
It doesn't even hurt.
You know, I'll go
get some bandages.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Oh, yeah! Uh, shortcut through the woods.
Aha, okay.
Well, listen,
my cell number is

Found the bandages.
And we found that secret
stash of Fudgsicles!
Ah! Jane!
Nice!
I guess now we're even.
Here.
[Knocking at the door]
- Um, I got it.
- No, no, no!
I got pop, chips,
and the first season of
The Bloodsucker Diaries. Who—
Where's your bathroom?
Oh, um...
It's down that hall there
to the left.
Dude...
isn't that your robo-babe
from school?
Yes.
I guess Erica couldn't come,
so she sent her instead.
So she's like a...
- ...substitute babe?
- Dude.
- Sweet!
- No, no. Not sweet.
Jeez, could you be less
of a geek for once?
Oh, yeah. This coming
from the guy who looks
like he pooped his pants
from the front.
Nice job, by the way.
It's Fudgsicle!
Anyway, let's order some 'zza.
I'm starving.
Hey. It's me.
[Sarah]: Erica,
please listen to me!
You have to get away
from those guys!
Give me the usual,
and supersize that puppy.
I'm next door. It's, uh,
exactly 7:19,
and you have 30 minutes
or it's free. Engage!
Just give her some privacy.
I think she's crying.
What did you say to her?
Just...
Go watch some TV
or something, okay?
I'm sure she'll be fine.
[Gasps]
Looking for something?
Or are you just
an incredible perv?
Uh... I... no!
I... uh...
[Whispering]: Benny!
- All right, dude.
This new Galactica
spin-off is on tonight,
and we should totally...
Okay, what's up?
I just saw Sarah. She was...
she was in front of the mirror,
but... not in it!
Okay, hold up. How much
aftershave did you drink?
Dude, I'm serious!
Her reflection was all wonky.
She's not normal, okay?
She's like a...
Hey, look. You guys don't
really need a sitter, do you?
Depends on what you mean
by "need."
No, no, we're fine.
My mom just likes
humiliating me to make a point.
Okay, good. I need to find my friend,
Erica. I think she's in trouble.
Uh, maybe I should come with you.
You know, for protection.
[Object hitting the floor]
[Ethan gasps]
Trust me, you don't want
to go out tonight. Besides,
save those muscles
for protecting yourself.
Did you just see that?
Uh...
Later, guys.
Uh...
Wow, smooth.
You get a mad-hot babe here, and you
have to immediately go and weird her out.
Well done. I'm very impressed.
I'm telling you,
I just saw something.
Okay, she's not normal,
and I'm going to find out
what's going on.
Fine. Undercover brother's
on a mission. I like it.
But... aren't you forgetting
something?
Yeah.
What are you forgetting?
Thanks, Grandma!
You're a lifesaver.
Any time, dear.
She smells funny.
No, she doesn't.
She... smells nice.
Like flowers and...
and mothballs.
All right, now if the pizza
isn't here in... 26 minutes,
you do not pay a dime.
Okay.
We uhm...
We will be right back.
I promise.
I hate being eight.
What is all that stuff?
Digicams with
night vision infrared.
You can't possibly expect us to
investigate the supernatural realm
without the proper equipment!
Fine! Just keep it
on the down-low, okay?
She already thinks I'm a perv.
You said her reflection
wasn't all there, right?
- Yeah.
- Here's a thought:
What if this is some publicity stunt
thing for that stupid Dusk movie?
If this is a "punk,"
I knew it all along!
Benny! Shh!
Come on. I think
she was headed towards town.
It's hopeless.
We lost her.
Must. Have. Pizza.
She's out here.
I... I feel it.
What?
[Rustling among trash cans]
[Glass scattering]
Shh. There's something
in the alley.
[Benny]: Night vision engaged.
What?
Benny, what?
Fine, I'm just going
to go see for—
We should leave.
- We should leave right now.
- Why?
[They scream]
[She roars]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
We are so dead!
Speak for yourself.
Skinny guy coming through!
Warp nine!
Ahhh! Help!
My babysitter's
a vampire!
Remember Halo Level Three?
The battle plan I sent you?
Evasive maneuvers.
Alpha phi strike delta six.
Engage!
Whoa! Ah! Oh!
You missed...
the pattern.
Sometimes...
I just skim your emails.
Fair enough.
- Thanks.
- What's your problem? [They scream]
Just hold on!
If you eat us,
that would so not be cool.
If I wanted to eat you,
I would have done it by now.
See? She's going to eat us!
We're doomed!
No, no, no.
I just want
- to talk to you guys!
- Demon of the night, be gone!
[She sighs] Guys, whatever you saw,
it's not what it looks like.
You're a freakin' vampire who eats
animals and drinks their blood!
Okay, so it is kind of what
it looks like, but—
I'm warning you,
I had garlic bread for lunch,
and I am not afraid
to use my breath.
Would you both just shut up?
I'm just a normal girl, okay?
At least I was until I got bit
by my crummy ex-boyfriend.
I'm technically still
a fledgling
until I drink human blood,
which I really
don't want to do, so...
...I have to figure out
how to stop this thing
before my mortal body dies,
or at least stop it from happening
to more people like Erica.
So you're sure this isn't some stupid
thing for that Dusk movie?
I wish. Come on.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not the only one
feeding tonight.
I'll take you two home, and if I'm lucky,
I'll find Erica before it's too late.
I never in a millions years
thought I'd start dating Julia
- in real life.
- There is so much chemistry
between them on set. I mean,
come on, 14 kissing scenes?
It was just a matter of time
before they became an item.
Uh-huh. Wow!
I... so don't care.
- [Man]: Password?
- O positive.
Can't you wait
just a few more days?
I've waited 80 years for you.
I have an...
exam tomorrow...
[Sighs]
[Screams]
Stop doing that!
[TV]: That movie about gorgeous vampires
who try not to eat humans is back—
[TV switches off]
About time! I'm so bored,
Grandma passed out five songs ago, and
she has, like, zero boom-boom-pow.
- Can we pleeease play now?
- Sorry, I've gotta go.
Just be careful, okay? And don't
tell anyone about... you know.
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'm cool.
And... nobody believes
anything Benny says anyways.
I'm serious, okay?
And whatever you do,
do not invite a vampire
into your house.
- It's your only safe haven.
- Got it. Thanks.
[Doorbell rings]
Oh, man.
Pizza dude is so late. Bonus!
Come on in, bro! Oh, man.
This is going to taste
so much better 'cause it's free!
Sorry, dude, but I am just
dying for a bite.
So am I.
[Pizza man snarls]
[They scream]
Jane, it's... it's okay.
He's just playing a game, you know?
Yeah, a game.
Whoever tells me
where Sarah is first
spends less time screaming.
- Can I play too?
- [Benny and Ethan]: Yes!
Jesse got tired of waiting,
so he sent me to come
pick you up.
Guess you are just
the delivery boy after all.
Heh-heh. At least I know
whose side I'm on...
...fledgling.
Okay, um...
Can I just grab a slice
before you do your whole
- vampire trash talk thing?
- Benny!
What? If I'm going
to he a last meal,
I want it to be
the Italiano Deluxe.
Right! Heh-heh.
Italiano Deluxe.
- With extra garlic!
- Aaah!
[Sizzling and steaming]
Gotcha!
Go, go, go!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
[Jane screaming]
[They snarl and roar]
Come on!
You're good.
I don't think
she's winning.
Of course she's not winning;
She's not a real vampire yet!
She's a vampire?
Uh...
Why is the pizza guy
acting all crazy?
Uh, he's just upset about
not getting paid. It'll be fine.
[Pizza man growling]
[She snarls]
- I'm calling Mom and Dad.
- No, no, no, don't.
You just have to trust me
on this one.
You make my bed
for a whole week.
It's a deal.
Thank you.
Somebody's coming.
Quick! Come on! Get the bed!
[Grunting with effort]
- [Sarah]: Let me in! Hurry!
- [Benny]: Oh! Okie-dokie.
[Grunting with effort]
What happened?
Where is he?
Let's just say I introduced him to
some of your mom's good silverware.
What do you have for weapons?
Um...
I don't know.
Um...
Uh... Hah!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
How about this?
A debating trophy?!
It's the pointiest!
- Ugh!
- Hey, hey, hey.
We can make a stake out of this.
No, no, no, no, no.
That is autographed!
By... by who?
Ryan Seacrest?! Really?
...really confusing when
you're in love with a creature
of the night. All you want
to do is be with—
These are perfect!
Sharp and wooden!
Great! If we're fighting
vampire squirrels!
Guys, he's coming! Hurry!
Did anybody ever tell you you
are a really bad babysitter?
I'm new at this.
[Cell phone rings]
Don't answer it!
- [Vampire]: Oh, Sarah!
- Hello?
Hi, Ethan?
Hi, honey, it's Mom.
[Vampire growling]
Hey, Ma!
Yeah, hi. Sweetie, could you
put the sitter on, please?
She can't really talk now—
Ethan, now is not a good time
to argue with me.
- Can you just please put her on?
= Okay...
- Hello?
- Hi, Sarah. It's me.
Look, we're going to be a little
bit late tonight.
I side-kicked Ethan's dad
in the head,
and, uh...
What is that noise?
Oh, uh, they're playing
a video game.
- [Vampire]: Let me in!
- Hey, keep it down, you guys!
Okay, I know that we said
we'd be home by 10 o'clock,
but could you stay
for an extra hour or two?
Okay, sure, that's fine.
See you then. Bye.
[Screaming]
[Yells in pain]
A debating trophy?
[Grunts]
[Snarls]
[Roars]
[Gushing, and vampire roaring]
Okay...
She may be
a lousy babysitter,
but that was the bomb!
Good luck cleaning this up
before your folks get home.
What, this?
This is nothing...
It's amazing
she can sleep now.
Yeah, Grandma's got
the magic touch.
When I was six
and scared of robots, she—
Fascinating! Look, if I can
get to Jesse's before midnight,
- I can still save Erica.
- So, that pizza guy. He's dead, right?
Not dead, no. Just in some
kind of limbo for souls,
but he won't be back here.
Found a survivor.
Okay, just stay inside
where you're safe, okay?
- Say hi to Erica for me.
- Dude!
[Cell phone ring tone]
Hold my pizza.
Should I even bother
picking up?
Why not?
Benny! Wazzup?!
Wazzuuuuahhh.
Wazzuuuup?
You guys are lame;
That's what's up.
If I'm so lame,
how am I chillaxin'
at the most slamming party
in town?
Wait, did we miss another
Mathletes event?
No, dude. A real party!
At this huge mansion!
And almost all the kids here
are seniors,
including the girls.
Hey, beautiful.
Like what you see?
Guys, this party is off
the hook!
How'd you get in?
These guys saw me
at Gamer Town
and asked me if I wanted
to come. Oh, and Benny,
your Dusker babe is here,
and she is looking fine!
[Camera clicks]
Check out the hot senior babe
she's dancing with.
Uh, Rory?
These seniors... They're not
from the drama club, are they?
Yeah, some of them.
Oh, and get this:
There's going to be a buffet
at midnight!
Rory, you need to listen,
okay? We need you—
Sorry,
I gotta go. Conga line!
Yeah!
[Benny whistles]
Oh, don't say it.
Don't, 'cause if you say it,
we'll have to go find
that dufus,
and I for one do not want to
crash a vampire dinner party.
Just come on.
Rory's our friend.
Agh! Fine.
I'll go.
But I'm not walking.
Got the keys,
gotta switch her to neutral,
- 'cause it'll keep us on the down-low.
- Okay.
What the heck is that?
Oh. Replacement bulbs
for Grandma's tanning bed.
She likes rocking a tan.
I've seen her come out of there once...
It's not pretty.
- Anyway, come on.
- Yeah. One sec...
I've got an idea.
Remember last year
when we dressed up as Jedis?
I'll get my dad's toolkit.
Excuse me, miss,
but, uh,
can you tell us where
the vampire party's at?
Okay, I'm acting crazy because
I got bit; what's your excuse?
[Party music and talking
in the distance]
Okay, you guys stay in the car.
Got it?
No way! You—
Stay! I'll be back
as soon as I can with
Erica and your friend, okay?
Come on! We can—
[She snarls]
Got it.
I actually wanted to stay in
the car, so that works for me.
Come on.
We can't let her
do this alone.
Hey, hey!
Easy with the shirt.
[Rock music]
Well!
Look who finally decided
to show up.
I guess Wes talked some sense
into you, huh?
Oh, yeah. We had
a real heart-to-heart.
Actually, uh,
I need to talk
to Erica. Alone.
So, now you have time for me?
No, no, it's cool.
Be my guest.
I'll go find Jesse.
He'll, uh,
really want to know
you're here.
Come on! You're not safe here.
We have to get out of here now!
You sound like my mother.
Don't worry, party pooper!
It's not like I'm going
to give in to peer pressure.
Besides, nobody here's
even drinking.
Not yet...
Dancing vampire babes,
12 o'clock.
We're supposed to be looking
for Rory, remember?
No, we're supposed to be
waiting in the car.
But if I'm going to die,
I'm going to die rich,
with some "Vampires Gone Wild"
footage.
You're going to get us caught!
Give me that camera.
- You've got shaky hands!
- I don't care.
Uh... um, uh...
He was let out for the can.
Had, uh, you know, to use a tree.
So glad I'm a dude vampire,
right?
- What are you doing?
- Playing the game. Play along.
Yeah, yeah.
Phew!
I had to go so bad,
I was going to die.
- ...Again!
- Again.
You went to pee together?
Dude...
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but a couple of weeks ago,
I got bit by a vampire,
and now I'm
a fledgling!
Wow.
You really expect me
to believe that?
I swear.
And if we don't get out now,
we'll never get out,
like, ever!
Okay, you sound like
something from Dusk.
Being undead is the bomb!
Creatures of the night,
what's uuuuup!!
Okay, don't overdo it now.
Let's just find Rory and Sarah
and let's get out of here.
Oh, hey.
You look fang-tastic, my dear.
Come on.
Fine.
I'll prove it to you.
Ah, there she is.
I knew my girl would come
around. Hm?
- Actually we were just leaving.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
You'd miss the main event.
This isn't just another party.
Stick around.
What?
It's just, I don't know.
I know they're vampires
and stuff, dude, but...
...we're finally
at a senior's party!
You want to dance,
don't you?
Just one.
I swear.
I know you want to.
Come on.

[Benny laughing]
Okay. Rory.
Where would Rory be?
Wazuuuup?
Rory.
So this girl,
she was so into me.
Gave me a wicked hickey.
I guess she could smell my qualifications.
- Rory, we gotta go.
- What? No way. We have to stay.
This party is bank!
Okay, look. Dude, we got him.
Let's get out of here
while we still can.
We can't go without Sarah.
Okay, do the words
"stay in the car" ring a bell?
They do with me.
A loud one!
Look!
There she is!
Yeah, with McScary.
You know, they look busy
doing stuff
that doesn't really concern us
non-undead types.
You know what I'm saying?
So let's...
I want to know
what they're up to.
Be patient. Hm?
In a few short days,
we will have our revenge.
[Clapping and cheering]
And more:
We will have this whole town!
[Man]: Yeah!
[Jesse]: But the prophecy can't be
fulfilled until we meet our target.
Two hundred and nineteen,
soul for soul.
- Lame. Where's the band?
- Shh!
- But I just—
- Shh!
It'll be an incredible night.
Like something out of a movie.
Movie, schmovie.
The Rorster needs food.
[Muffled speech]
[Jesse]: Fine. Enough talk.
We're all hungry,
the moon is full...
Let's eat.
[Cheers]
We have to leave...
fast.
Come on.
It only gets better from here.
It's locked.
Whoa. Whoa.
Where are you girls going?
You're just in time
for dinner.
Sweet! What's on the menu?
Us! Rory,
the menu's us!
Ohhhh.
[Crickets chirping]
[Jesse]: Mmm!
Ah!
Don't they look delicious?
You can't. Not them!
I know these kids.
I'm babysitting them.
Well, I'm sorry, but...
Wait. You still need
a babysitter?
Oh, no, no.
He, he needs a babysitter.
[Laughing]
No, I don't!
So, why exactly do you need
a babysitter?
No one here needs
a babysitter, okay?
Just because he's a vampire, does he
have to be such a dorkwad? Seriously...
[Roars]
Whoa! Whoa!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Initiations will follow
tradition.
Fledglings drink first.
[Heart beat]
Hear his heart pumping?
It's the beat of a whole
new world waiting for you—
one where you'll never die,
never grow old...
One bite,
and it's yours.
Sarah, don't!
[Gasps]
[Church bell tolling]
[Fire roaring]
Oh, I will do it.
- Erica, no! - Hey, girls,
there's no need to fight over me.
[Gushing and sucking]
- [Man]: Whoa!
- Back off! I mean it!
Sarah. Seriously,
where can you go?
Benny!
Come on!
[Electricity sizzling]
[Groaning in pain]
[Benny]: We're dead!
We're so dead!
No, it's okay!
We've just got to find Sarah!
No, she's abandoned us!
Are you kidding me?
[People]: Let's go! Come on!
[Roars]
Come on!
[Ethan]: We're harnessing
the force... of sunlight!
[Benny]: It's actually ultraviolet radiation
in a spectrum similar to the sun.
[Ethan laughs]
No way! It works!
[Grunting with effort]
[Benny]: This is so wick'!
[Growling and snarling]
[Ethan]: Good thing your
grandma likes to tan.
It's from his grandma's
tanning bed.
You guys are king dorks!
[Benny chuckles]
[Snarling]
[Yoda impression]: The force
is strong in you, young Padawan.
[Ethan]: You're the Padawan;
I'm the Jedi!
[Benny]: Yeah, right!
I'm the Jedi master!
[Sarah]: Now can we run
to the car?!
Go!
[Grunting with effort]
- Move!
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Drive! Drive! Drive!
Don't you run from me!
Argh!
[Ethan's mom sighs]
I gave Sarah a little bit extra
because she was here so late.
Your poor dad...
He's already gone up.
It's just like
our honeymoon.
Oh, it's a...
long story.
Anyway, Sarah said you had
something important to tell me?
Were you and Benny playing
lightsabers again?
Yes. Heh...
Yes, we were.
Ethan...
The next time Sarah comes here
to sit, I'm going to tell her
not to put up with
any of this funny business.
Do you understand me?
Yep. Heh-heh.
Sounds good to me.
[She sighs]
- I blame video games.
- Yeah. That and the rap music.
Right.
Thanks, Mom.
Okay.
Go to bed.
[Rory]: Guys!
Wazzzuuuup?
Rory, you're...
We though you were dead.
All I know is,
I woke up the morning
after the party feeling awesome.
No asthma,
I don't need my glasses,
and I barely have
to sleep anymore.
The only problem's the sun:
Kind of annoying.
You're a fledgling too?
Pfft! Heck, no!
I'm rocking the full-on
vampire action, dude.
The big V!
Can I get a what-what?
What?
You drank human blood?
They said if I didn't,
I'd die.
All the other kids were
doing it!
Do you have any idea what you've
just done to yourself?
I'm immortal
and all-powerful, dude.
Ka-chow!
Sorry, I gotta go to church.
Church?
Vampires don't do church.
Jesse says we have to.
He's so bossy. He's all,
blah-blah, the prophecy,
and blah-blah, you must find
the Cuban animals, or—
[Together]: Cuban animals?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
That's what it sounded like.
Anyway, we'll hang out later.
Or "fang-out"!
Zing!
Come on.
Grab your backpack.
You and I are going
to church.
What?
[Organ music]
Uh...
It's for my, uh...
it's for my Aunt Sassy.
She, uh, she couldn't get
to mass. She's got the...
...Belgian Pig Flu,
and stuff...
...and Ebola!
Anyway,
I gotta go.
Keep the faith, eh?
[Benny grunting with effort]
Shh!
They're over there.
Look at them.
Hoodies and sunglasses.
- Nice look if you're—
- [Sarah]: Hey.
[Both]: Ah!
Looking good.
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.
I'm following them. I just wish
I knew what they were up to.
Well, according to Rory,
they're after
the "Cuban animals."
Cuban animals?
You mean cubile animus?
I've heard Jesse mention
it before. I think
it's Latin or something.
Two hundred and nineteen...
Wikipedia says that cubile
animus is Latin for "nest of souls."
I think I just saw it.
- This little box with weird
carvings on it. - A box?
Like that one?
The cubile animus.
Great.
Nest of souls.
How long till
something hatches?
- We have to stop them.
- Heh. We've got a fresh supply
- of anti-vampire juice.
- Ow! What the heck?!
[Sniffing]
[Growling]
[Breathing heavily]
[Sarah]: So...
What's with these "visions"?
You get them often?
No. They started
when you showed up.
It's like, a door opens to a whole
other dimension or something.
I think it happens
when we touch. Here.
Nice try,
Casanova.
Can't blame a player
for trying.
But... maybe I'd get visions,
too, if I—
- Cut it out!
- Sorry.
You don't get visions.
And if I see that hand again,
I'll consider it a snack.
So Jesse never told you
what the prophecy is?
Or what 219 means?
I'm just a fledgling,
remember?
He'd only tell
a real vampire.
None of them are dumb enough
to just tell us.
Well...
...one of them is.
And I...
...have his number.
[Knocking]
Hi.
Sorry to interrupt.
Just dropping something off.
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?
You ever, like...
...see things?
Like,
things that aren't there?
Are we, um, talking
about drugs?
[He laughs]
No.
Like, a vision?
Or strange images
that just appear?
No, I don't think so, honey.
Okay...
But there was...
this one time.
I used to watch you sleep
when you were a baby.
One night,
I had this image of you,
and you were all grown up,
and you were strong
and smart and decent.
And I knew then that you were
going to do great things one day.
Thanks, Mom.
But you do know that
if you ever touch drugs
that your father and I will
have to kill you.
Uh, got it! Okay...
[Sarah clears her throat]
Oh! Look who's here.
Hey. I, uh, brought that book,
the one you said
you wanted to borrow.
Yeah! The book, right.
Wow, isn't that nice.
Thank you.
Yeah, the kids can't wait
for you to babysit again.
Mom.
I guess you made
quite an impression.
Mom.
Okay, well, I guess
I'll leave you two...
...alone.
You know, there's milk
and cookies in the kitchen,
if you feel like.
Okay...
That was... humiliating.
[She sighs]
You feeling okay?
Yeah,
I'm just really hungry.
I might head into town later
for a bite.
Ah. Another rat hunt,
heh-heh.
[He shudders]
I don't think I can do that.
I know, right?
It's so gross!
And the hunger is just getting
stronger.
A fledgling has 28 days
to drink human blood,
or their mortal body dies.
Really?
Is that true?
I'll know in about a week.
But it won't matter much
if we can't stop Jesse
and the others.
But I found this book
at the library that might help.
Believe it or not,
not everything is on the net.
Let's see.
"A History of Whitechapel,
1894."
"The town of Whitechapel was actually
once known as Black's Church,
"founded in 1809
by Reverend Horace Black.
"Black's disciples preyed upon
the nearby townspeople
"until the night
of a lunar eclipse,
"when an angry mob trapped them all in their
place of worship and burned it to the ground.
"Two hundred and nineteen people died, and
their remains buried in an unmarked grave.
The next year, the town was
reborn as Whitechapel."
[He shudders]
What was that?
Another vision?
Yeah. It just stopped.
I feel like there's something missing.
There's more.
Something important.
I need you to touch me again.
This had better not be
another line.
Just... please?
[Breathing heavily]
Okay, um...
The book...
...left out one huge detail.
Reverend Black...
...is Jesse.
Oh, no...
So that's why 219 is the target!
And the cubile animus thing
is going to help him get it.
[Pounding on the window]
[Rory]: Hey, dudes!
Is it a bird?
Is it a plane?
No, it's super Rory!
[Sizzling]
Ow! What the heck?
You have to be invited in,
genius!
Jesse doesn't tell us
anything... So, can I come in?
Yes.
But as long as you promise
no blood sucking.
- Okay?
- Dude.
My mouth
on your neck?
Ugh!
Rory, we need you to help us
figure out what Jesse is planning.
Uh, yeah.
He's not a high school kid;
He's a cult leader
from over 200 years ago,
- and if—
- No way!
- Wait till I tell him!
- Rory! No!
He already knows, okay?
And it's not cool.
Unless we stop him...
...a lot of people could die,
including us.
Whoa.
Stinks not being immortal.
His plan has something to do
with a prophecy.
Maybe you could check
his library?
Yeah, we need details.
Fast, okay?
And find out what the cubile
animus thing is for.
Okay, that was a let-down.
It's just some crusty old box.
- But Jesse's happy, so...
[Ethan's mom]: Ethan!
- Dinner is coming in.
- Um... she can't see you, okay?
You gotta go. Now!
- Ethan? Oh!
- I was just leaving.
Do you need me to babysit
on Friday?
Uh, yeah, sure.
That'd be great.
Wow, you've got a really strong
grip for a little young thing.
Whoa. Ah...
Uh... Ah...
Whoa.
Whoa!
[Thud]
Oomph!

Or what?
Or... this!
Oh!
[Shrieking]
Okay.
Now you're both dead.
Stand back.
Behold!
The flame of invincibility.
This is Plan B?
Seriously?!
You know we're not actually
afraid of fire, right?
You should have done some
research or something.
[Sizzling]
[Roaring in pain]
Tell Grandma
to answer the phone.
Hold on, B.
Stay with me.
Come on.
Come on. Hurry.
The eclipse is in eight minutes
and we have to find Jesse.
Take the car. I'm too weak,
and the hunger is getting
stronger.
You have to come with us.
We have to stop Jesse and—
Just go. Now!
Come on, B.
Benny.
Hey...
Hey. Jesse must be taking
the nest of souls
to wherever his followers are
buried, okay?
Um... where is that?
Yep. Found love
at the snack bar, my friend.
- Ha! Ow...
- Benny.
Okay, the prophecy
says, "The dead take root,
a barren orchard bears
the devil's fruit."
Okay. A barren orchard, uh...
Benny?
You know, I gave her my address:
Fifty-three Orchard Park.
Come any time.
Wait... That tree.
That tree from my visions!
I know that tree.
Okay, it's not possible...
- Benny?
- Hm.
- Benny, I'm going to call your grandma
to come get you, okay? - Okay.
Okay, we've got four minutes
left to save the world.
You hang tough, okay?
I never did like that tree.
[Jesse]: Funny how they name streets
after what they tore down to build them.
This used to be an orchard;
One of my favorite spots
until your idiot ancestors
burned my flock alive.
Yeah? Well, I'd say
their only mistake was not
finishing the job.
You made me miss my target,
so the rest of my flock may
have to wait a little longer.
That's fine. I still have enough
Dusker souls here
to resurrect a few dozen
of the most powerful
vampires that ever lived.
And you'll have the honor of being
their first midnight snack.
Well,
you won't have to wait,
because I'm going to reunite you
with your flock right now.
Just not in this world.
Ha! Ha!
[Struggling]
It's funny, I knew your
grandfather's grandfather.
He was a loser too.
[Struggling]
[Laughing softly]
[Benny]: Courage!!
Owww!
Sorry, bud.
The hour of rebirth has come.
Brothers, sisters, arise!
[Sarah yelling]
Whoa!
[Both grunting with effort]
Hey!
I've got your friends in a box.
And I've got your babysitter.
Okay, she's really
Jane's babysitter.
Give me the cubile animus!
- The souls must be transferred now!
- Sarah!
Just give it to him.
What are we going to do with
a nest of souls anyway? EBay it?
Now! Hand it over,
or she dies!
Ethan, no, don't!
[Benny's grandma and Jane]:
Alma, alphras, selrnok, kathran
Aaah!
Hey! You can have the box.
But not what's inside.
You wrecked their premiere
Now you deal with them.
No... No... No!
No. what have you done?
Aaah!
[screams in pain]
Can't believe you
dated that guy.
Oh hey!
You're back.
Had fun?
Yeah. it was—
it was... fun.
- Except that th— the...
- You know what they say about karma?
How was your night?
Did you have any trouble?
Ah, not much.
It was... pretty dead.
No no no. I'd like to ask you
not to repeat these silly rumors
of alledged "attacks" in here.
In the first place, fans of the vampire
genre have active imaginations.
And secondly,
I am told that defective
3D glasses may have cause
adverse neurological side effects.
In any case, there won't be anymore
Dusker events of my watch. Believe it.
Faulty 3D glasses? Who's gullible
enough to believe that.
Ahm... These are Duskers
we're talking about, remember?
Oh Besides. Town is safe.
Jesse's rejoined his flock.
It's all good, right?
Yeap.
You— You're not
still dying, are you?
I mean... you mortal body
seems to be doing just fine.
Thanks, well... Benny's grandmother
makes a mean human blood substitute.
That, and she found my spell book.
Hey guys!
[Muffled voice]
Hey.
Pretty much all over.
- Let's go to class.
- Good idea.
The trick with the spell is...
you gotta phrase it like Klingon,
kinda like with a Romulan twang.
It's like a splash of Cylon...
[Ethan] Benny!
[Ethan and Sarah] Shut up!
[Benny] Sorry.
