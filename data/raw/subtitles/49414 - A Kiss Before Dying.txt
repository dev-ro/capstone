Crying isn't going to help.
I just can't help it.
Dory.
I've known about it for days...
and I didn't want to say
anything until I was sure.
But I've known.
No mistake possible?
No.
How far?
Two months, almost.
You didn't give the doctor
your right name, did you?
No.
He knew I was lying.
It was awful.
You shouldn't have gone alone.
I should have gone with you.
What are we going to do?
Well...
I know you want me to say we'll get
married right away, tomorrow, but...
You don't want to get out of it, do you?
Don't even think that.
I love you.
I love you.
I want to marry you
more than anything else in the world.
Only, your...
He doesn't matter.
He's your father. He does.
What he thinks is important.
All I know is we don't have any choice.
Look, honey...
I know this is a shock,
but it isn't the end of the world.
Sure, it's a problem,
but a thing like this can change, Dory.
No.
There's always a chance. You know that.
I suppose so.
Come on.
That's better.
Come on, honey. We better go.
My mother will be home soon.
Okay?
Okay.
I don't feel good.
I can't even eat.
That's natural.
I know, but the girls
in the sorority house...
are gonna start asking questions.
I know what we can do about that.
A friend of mine, Hermy Gosset, remember him?
One of his cousins owns a pharmacy.
Hermy works there, nights.
I can talk to him.
Maybe he can give me something
to make you feel better.
You won't say anything, will you?
Of course not.
Come on. Will you stop worrying?
Everything's going to be all right.
Okay.
Come on, honey. We'd better go.
Be careful you don't leave anything around.
Okay?
What's this bit?
This is an article on the curvature of space.
Curvature of space?
- Hi.
- How you been?
- Fine. Yourself?
- Pretty good.
Say, have you got something
for an upset stomach, real potent?
I have something that just came in today.
That'll do it?
It should.
- Good night, Elsie.
- Night, Gordon.
- Don't get run over.
- Okay.
- How much?
- $1.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- Thanks, Hermy.
- You're welcome.
Dime.
Want to slide over, honey?
Here.
- What is it?
- I don't know for sure.
Something to settle your stomach.
It can't hurt you.
All right.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
I thought we'd wait awhile
and see what happens.
Why do we have to wait?
Why don't we get married right now?
You know why as well as I.
He doesn't matter.
He hardly seems like a father at all.
What did he do to your mother?
Go on, say it. He threw her out.
One slip. He finds out years later,
divorces her, sick and all...
not caring one bit for you or your sister.
What do you think he'd do to you
if we married this way...
without me even meeting him?
And then a few short months later...
He'd forget you ever existed.
You wouldn't get a penny.
I don't care.
But I do. Not for me, certainly, but for you.
I've got to, for your sake, don't you see?
No!
You've had money all your life.
You couldn't do without it.
We'd be at each other's throats in a year.
We wouldn't. Not us.
All right.
Okay, honey, we love each other so much
we never argue.
So, where are we?
In a furnished room with paper drapes,
eating spaghetti seven nights a week?
If I saw you living like that, I'd take out
insurance and jump in front of a car.
I had it planned so beautifully.
I'd have come to Payson with you, met him.
I'd have gotten him to like me.
We'd have gotten married,
come back here to finish up.
Our little apartment of our own,
right near campus.
No early-morning classes.
Stop it!
What are you trying to do?
Why are you saying these things?
Look, I'm pregnant, right now.
I know, honey.
I was trying to show you
how beautiful it could've been.
But it isn't. It's the way it is.
I know it is, but all I'm asking
is just wait a few days.
And if there's no change?
No question then.
None at all.
We'll get married right away
and forget all about your father.
Okay?
Okay.
- Don't you want me to drive you home?
- No, thanks. I feel like walking.
Good night.
Good night.
- It's not right.
- What?
For anyone to love somebody
as much as I love you.
That makes us even.
Then we haven't got anything to worry about.
Haven't you heard?
Love conquers all.
- Hello, Son.
- Hi, Mother.
- Had your dinner?
- I'm not hungry.
There's a sandwich in the kitchen.
I'll get it.
- Never mind. I don't feel like it.
- You've got to eat something.
Why?
- Aren't you feeling well?
- Mother, will you, please?
There's something wrong.
- You can't fool me. I know you too well.
- Please, will you?
It's just that...
I have to get something special ready
for a speech tomorrow.
I haven't much time to do it in.
You work too hard. You should play more.
- I haven't any time.
- A person's got to relax sometime.
Look, I'm 25 years old.
Where am I? No place.
I don't want to wind up like Dad
with holes in my shoes.
You're not like him. Not at all.
You'll see. Anything
you decide to do, you'll do it.
I know.
Sure. I'm a genius.
I think so.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Any change?
I think we ought to decide and set a date.
You're not mad, are you?
Of course not.
Don't be so unhappy about it.
I know it's not the way we planned,
but it'll be all right.
Sure. It'll be great.
- I'll quit school, get a job.
- No!
You won't have to.
You'll get more money from the government now
because you have a wife.
$105 a month.
Other people get along.
Soda jerk.
How does that sound?
I had such plans.
Everybody expected so much of me.
It's all my fault.
- It's always the girl's fault.
- Look, maybe there is a way to tell your...
- We could call your father.
- No!
But we could appeal to him.
Tell him we did a terrible thing,
make amends.
It won't do any good.
I know him. I know the way he feels about me.
- But all we have to...
- No!
We'll get along.
- Prove to him we don't need him.
- Who needs him? I'm only asking...
I don't even want him.
For the first time in my life,
I feel like me.
I'm not Dorothy anymore.
That's my father's daughter and his property.
I'm Dory now, because you said so.
Sure.
I've done wonders for you. I really have.
A new name, a new address...
Poverty Row it'll be.
No. I'm gonna be rich.
Don't you see?
I'll have everything I ever wanted.
I'll have somebody to love
and to take care of.
And I'll have somebody
to love me just for myself.
Okay, honey.
- We'll go down to the Municipal, Friday and...
- Why Friday?
A few days won't make any difference.
Be practical, honey.
There's things
to take care of, the license...
Besides, if we go Friday, we'll have
the whole weekend for our honeymoon.
That's right.
It's exciting, isn't it?
Let's go somewhere.
I can't. I've got a Chem lab
and a ton of Spanish.
I want to get things cleared away,
so we'll be free.
Okay.
I'll get to work, too.
I love you.
You don't want to get out of it, do you?
Silly. Who wants out?
- Call me?
- First chance.
You haven't told anybody? Your sister or...
No, but I thought I ought to.
- Is that wise?
- Ellen's all right.
- She'll understand. She'll even help.
- You know, I was thinking.
Maybe we ought to keep it our little secret
until after the wedding.
Okay. Anything you say.
- You all right?
- Yes.
- You had me worried.
- It's all right.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, Kingship.
You forgot our appointment
last night, didn't you?
Gordon, I'm sorry.
I wasn't feeling very well.
You listen, young lady,
I've got a reputation.
No one that I've tutored thus far...
has flunked out,
so I don't want you starting anything.
I'm gonna be kind of busy next week,
but what do you want me to do?
I think you run over Chapter 14
and try the problems, will you?
- And I am sorry. Bye.
- Bye.
- You in Albertson's class?
- No.
What's with him, anyway?
I don't know. He's like that, I guess.
Did he say aldehydes or ketones?
Aldehydes, I think.
I wish he wouldn't talk
like he had a mouthful of mush.
- So long.
- So long.
I'm not much good without my notebook.
Let me see your notes.
Try it with ether.
I'm sure they'll fit.
I made them the same size as the other ones.
They're beautiful.
I want to do everything for you.
And I will.
Finish your hamburger, will you?
You remember that picture of me I gave you?
Could you lend it to me?
I'd like to make some copies.
Mother wants to send some to relatives.
Have you told her yet?
No. I didn't think it was fair.
You're not telling your family.
I'm dying to meet her.
What's that?
That's me, a couple of years ago.
Pretty skinny.
There's Dad, and that's Ellen.
It's her birthday.
She'd just gotten a new hi-fi set.
She's crazy about Debussy.
Not bad. A little beat.
I think it's very handsome,
and I want it back.
Come on, honey.
It's getting late.
Darling, I've been meaning to ask you.
Can we go to the prom?
I thought you didn't want us
to be seen around.
All those out-of-the-way places
we've been going to.
I just didn't want it to get back to Dad
that I was going steady.
It doesn't matter now.
- Do you really want to go to the prom?
- Please.
Then that's where you're going to go.
Hi.
I'm struggling with this Spanish.
I'll help you after class.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Last time, I'm afraid
the bell interrupted us...
at a time when we were developing
several major concepts.
Because of that,
I think it might be a good idea...
if we reviewed some of the ground
that we covered last time.
I might point out to you, if I may,
that our relationship demands eventually...
a testing program in this class,
and you might find it a good idea...
to pay attention to what I am saying...
and perhaps to this diagram on the board.
We discussed the Trinitarian aspect of it.
And certainly when we read
in the works of Edwards, particularly...
we saw a very painful thing.
We saw a man trying to reconcile
predestination with free will.
And not succeeding, of course.
We discussed Puritanism, you may remember.
I don't want to say
too much about it again...
but remember that it,
with its concept of predestination...
you have what is essentially
a pessimistic philosophy.
It might, in fact,
even be called a theological determinism.
And then later
we came to what I like to call "rationalism."
Now it's variously called other things.
The age itself is called the Age of Reason.
It's called the Age of Enlightenment.
Sometime, someplace, man in our society...
surmounted it,
and it will come out of it or perish.
Hello?
Dory? It's me.
Listen, I've got to see you right away.
I can't come out right now.
I just washed my hair.
It's important.
Has it anything to do with tomorrow?
- Yes.
- Something's wrong?
Just the opposite. It's wonderful news.
Tell me.
I want to see your face when I tell you.
You can meet me, can't you?
Where?
- How about the fountain? 15 minutes okay?
- Okay. Bye.
- Hi.
- Hi, Annabelle.
- Boy, have I been operating.
- You sound like it.
You know what happened?
I ran into this fellow I used to know.
Guess what he's doing?
He's assistant manager of the Desert Palms.
He thinks he can get us a bungalow
for the weekend for a couple bucks.
Wonderful!
I'm on my way to see him,
to see if he can swing it.
How's that for luck?
You feel better about it, don't you?
I admit, I was nervous at first.
But it's going to work out. I know it is.
Before I forget...
I saw Hermy today.
He gave me these.
- What are they?
- For you.
- I don't need anything. I feel fine.
- They're not for your stomach.
They're vitamins,
high-potency stuff, brand-new.
Hermy just got some samples in.
He's going to order some more for us.
Fine mother you're going to be.
You don't even keep up with developments.
These were in
all the leading medical journals last month.
Dutiful father.
I suppose you know what's in them,
cover-to-cover.
I don't have to. I know Hermy.
Darling, I know you can't go
to the doctor yet...
but I do want you
to start taking care of yourself.
- Nothing.
- Use your handkerchief.
The gelatin might melt.
You should take these after dinner...
so you can do that
when you get back to the house.
If you don't care about
your family's health, I do.
Listen, honey, I gotta go.
I gotta meet Stanley.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Sweetheart...
Both of them.
Hello?
Dory? Me.
I just saw Stanley. It's all set.
We got the deal.
That's wonderful.
I already put down
a deposit on it, to seal it.
Did you take the capsules?
- Yes.
- When?
Just a few minutes ago.
Listen, I forgot to tell you.
They might hurt a little,
burn, or give you some pains.
But don't get frightened.
Hermy said that some people
are allergic to them at first.
But you don't have to call anyone.
All right.
See you tomorrow?
Good night.
Goodbye, baby.
Thanks.
You're the greatest.
You want some eggs?
No, thanks.
I don't want to be late for class.
Mother, pick one.
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe I'm wasting my time at the university.
- Why, what do you mean?
- I don't know.
I thought maybe I'd quit school,
get a job in some big business.
I don't know.
You know, I've got an idea.
Why don't you quit work early tonight?
We'll go out to dinner
and catch an early show.
You don't want to go out with me.
I certainly do.
You're still my best girl, aren't you?
And I've been neglecting you lately.
Tell Mr. Miller you want
to leave early tonight...
that you've got a date with your son.
We'll see.
What is it? What's wrong?
Darling...
It's my side, where I was wounded.
Just gives me a twinge once in a while.
I thought you were having a heart attack.
- I'm fine. Go back in class.
- Do you have them very often?
- The lecture's beginning.
- I don't care. I want to stay here with you.
You can't! I mean...
I got something important to do.
I gotta do it right now.
Will you go back in class?
- I don't want to.
- Then go to the house. I'll phone you.
- But, darling...
- I can't stand here.
Last night about 9:30.
I gotta get it back!
It was mailed by mistake.
- Sorry, I'd like to help, but it's too late.
- What do you mean?
It'll be delivered in an hour or so.
- Hello?
- Dory? Me.
Are you all right?
Just fine.
- Are you ready?
- What, now?
Didn't I tell you?
There's no point in waiting.
Meet me at Congress, by the clock, at 12:15.
You can make it, can't you?
- All I have to do is change.
- Good.
I better bring something along
to prove I'm over 18.
- It's still our secret, isn't it?
- Of course.
Remember now, 12:15 sharp, okay?
Okay.
Hello, Husband.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
After you.
- Wait for me.
- Nervous bridegroom.
How dumb can you get?
I should've called first.
- 20 minutes yet.
- Let's go have a Coke.
I've got an idea.
Why don't we go to the roof?
It's a terrific day. We can see for miles.
Last chance to see the world
as a single woman.
- Let's walk. It's only two flights.
- All right.
It's beautiful.
Look at that sky.
It's so bright.
Honey, look, the campus.
Look, you can almost see the house.
Boy, are those girls going to be surprised.
They don't even know I'm going with you.
I feel so good, I can't tell you.
You going to write your sister or phone?
Phone. Who can wait for letters?
- You'll like Ellen. You'll see.
- I'm sure I will.
Darling...
You're not sorry
about the way things turned out, are you?
Of course not.
You know, I lied to you.
You know those pills you gave me?
I didn't take them.
Why not?
I'm so ashamed. I don't know how to say it.
It's just that...
I knew how you felt about the baby...
at first anyway.
I was afraid you might want to...
It doesn't matter.
Anyway, I'm very ashamed.
But I'm glad I told you.
It's no way to start a marriage, with deceit.
I forgive you.
Don't look down.
You might get dizzy.
What did you do with the capsules?
They're in my bag.
New blouse?
No. It's old as the hills.
- You know something?
- What?
You look like a very happy girl.
I am.
- Never been a happier one.
- I have something to do with it?
Everything.
I've never felt like this
before in my whole life.
I know what you mean.
- Hadn't we better go?
- There's time.
- You know something else?
- What?
You're really very sweet.
No foolin'.
The sweetest,
gentlest person I've ever known.
You're prejudiced.
No.
It's true.
I love you.
I really do.
I believe you.
The thing is,
you'll never really know how I love you.
I mean...
No one can really understand
the way the other loves.
I don't believe that.
It's true.
It really is.
"Darling, I hope you'll forgive me
for the unhappiness that I will cause.
"There is nothing else that I can do."
The note and the medical report
seem to tell the whole story.
Terrible thing.
I sympathize.
I realize it's too late
to keep the story out of the papers...
but I'd appreciate it
if certain details were omitted.
I understand.
Some things are best out of the papers,
especially about youngsters.
I knew your daughter, Mr. Kingship.
She was a very fine girl.
- You knew her?
- Not as a policeman, but as a tutor.
I helped her in mathematics.
My nephew works in my office part-time
while he's in school.
Did you... Have you any...
Have any idea who the man was?
No, but you realize, of course...
he's not legally responsible
for your daughter's death.
- Not legally.
- We can do some checking, if you like.
If you think it would accomplish anything...
except to stimulate the kind of talk
that you want to avoid.
- You're right.
- That seems to be all.
There were some valuables in her purse.
- Dispose of them as you see fit.
- But...
I'd consider it a favor.
Miss Kingship...
if there's anything that I can do
to be of assistance...
in any official way,
please feel free to call on me.
- My name's Gordon Grant.
- You've already been helpful, Mr. Grant.
You know, there's just no explaining
why these things have to happen.
- I'm very sorry.
- Ellen?
Miss Ellen, Mr. Corliss is calling.
Thank you.
Hello, Bud.
I told you, you're coming here
for Thanksgiving.
Yes.
I thought we could have dinner
tonight here, too.
For once, let's get to the ballet on time.
All right, then.
Dinner out, if you're so proud.
7:00? I'll be ready.
Goodbye.
"Dear Ellen, you may recognize this
as the belt to the suit Dorothy wore last.
"We were sorority sisters,
and on her last day...
"... Just before she went out,
she borrowed one of my belts.
"It was a cheap leather belt.
"We both knew it didn't go
with her suit at all.
"Still, she wanted it
and left this one in its place.
"I hope I was right in waiting
these many months before sending it.
"Sincerely, Annabelle Koch. "
What is that?
Dorothy's belt.
A girl from her sorority sent it.
Very thoughtful of her.
Or thoughtless,
however you feel about these things.
I'd have thrown it away and not mentioned it.
I know.
- What was accomplished by it?
- What has to be accomplished by it?
Some people do things
out of nothing more than sentiment.
Softness, you'd probably call it.
As opposed to my callousness? My hardness?
I think, Ellen, you mistake
parading an emotion...
for feeling one.
I don't think I've paraded mine
any more than you've felt yours.
If you've had one moment of remorse,
one second when you even wondered...
if you were responsible,
then you've concealed it wonderfully.
You have my deepest admiration,
if not sympathy.
That's true.
I haven't dwelt on the matter
to the point of distorting the facts.
I haven't distorted them,
not in my own mind at least.
I said once, long ago,
I couldn't believe she killed herself.
I haven't changed a bit.
Ellen...
Yes, Dad?
I thought tonight it might
do us both good to...
The Vincents said something about the ballet.
I'm going with Bud.
He's picking me up at 7:00.
When does that young man
get his studying done?
You might have asked the same thing of me.
As a matter of fact,
he's a very good student.
And I like him very much.
That's fine.
I'm glad.
- Kingship's residence.
- Your Lupton call.
Right here. Your call to Lupton, Miss Ellen.
Thank you, Mary.
Hello?
Miss Kingship.
It's nice to hear you again.
You once offered a helping hand, Mr. Grant.
I'm taking you at your word.
That's the idea.
You name it, and I'll try and do it.
And I'd rather discuss it with you in person,
not over a phone.
To tell you the truth,
I'd prefer that myself.
Tomorrow afternoon?
I could leave here in the morning...
and be there about...
Wait a minute. I think we've hit a snag.
I have to be in Deming tomorrow.
I promised to give a lecture
at the teachers' college.
How about the day after?
Could you meet me
in the lobby of the San Carlos Hotel?
Say 8:00?
- Tonight?
- Yes.
I'll try for the first plane out of here.
I promise not to hold you up.
I just don't want to lose two days.
Please? I'd appreciate it very much.
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Mary?
Will you get my pink cotton dress for me?
And an overnight bag.
But I'm getting things ready for tonight.
I have to cancel that.
And I want you to deliver a message
to Mr. Corliss when he calls for me.
There's no way I can reach him now.
Tell him something important
has come up about Dorothy...
some new information...
and I'm having to leave for Lupton now
to talk to the police.
Ask him to forgive me.
Tell him I'll call him the minute I get back.
I'll tell him, Miss Ellen.
Airport?
Reservations desk, please.
Then, just before I called you...
I remembered something that happened
two days before she died.
I mailed her gloves to her.
She'd had them a long time
and was fond of them.
- But those she wore the day she died...
- I know. They were ruined.
They were brand-new.
Don't you even begin to see?
I guess we'll just have to face it.
You're talking to a pretty stupid man.
Brand-new gloves, a borrowed belt...
a blue handkerchief, an old blouse.
"Something old, something new
"Something borrowed, something blue"
Where's the Marriage License Bureau?
In the Municipal Building.
I think Dorothy went there to get married
and not to kill herself.
To go a step further, Mr. Grant,
I don't think she did kill herself.
- And the suicide note?
- Where did it say suicide?
"I hope you will forgive me
for the unhappiness I'll cause.
"There is nothing else I can do."
Her marriage would've made my father unhappy.
But as we know now, what else could she do?
If we can identify her boyfriend,
I think you'll find I'm right.
And I've done some thinking about him, too.
Dorothy wrote me when the semester began.
Said she met someone,
in English Literature, I believe...
who was the real thing.
- She didn't mention his name, but...
- Ellen...
You've really been thinking about this,
haven't you?
I mean, you've done a lot of thinking.
Brooding, my father calls it.
You can call it that, too. I'm not sensitive.
I know that when tragedy hits hard...
the mind is apt to come up with
a lot of far-fetched ideas.
Like this? In other words,
you don't believe me.
- I didn't say that.
- What about your uncle? Would he?
If you think I like imagination,
you ought to have a session with him.
Thanks very much anyway, Mr. Grant.
Gordon.
Look...
Let me tell you a little more about my uncle.
If your sister was murdered...
he wants to know about it
as much as you do, and so do I.
I'll admit, there wasn't much
of any kind of investigation...
but frankly, at that time,
there wasn't a need for one.
All right. Let's say there is now.
- Let's say we at least check into it, okay?
- Then you will help?
You got yourself a date
for the day after tomorrow morning.
That's when I'll be back.
And this student lent my sister
a fairly large sum of money.
The trouble is, we can't find any record
that she ever repaid him.
And he's evidently
felt awkward about reclaiming it.
I understand.
What makes us feel awkward,
we don't know who he is...
just that he's tall and slender
and was in her English class.
I thought if you'd let me
look at the records...
But that was two semesters ago.
- He may not even be here now.
- If I can name him, I can find him.
I'll have you talk with our Registrar.
She might be able to help you.
Harvey Levitch, 5' 3", 164.
Roy Dublin, 5' 8", 151.
Mr. Dublin wears glasses,
a bohemian-type, sloppy clothes and such.
Dwight Powell, 6' 1", 174.
Very good-looking, dark-haired,
polished, a speech major.
Speech?
Dorothy said he had a tape recorder.
They were going to send me a birthday message
and never got to it.
Do you have an address?
This one is scratched out.
He must have moved.
Watkins dorm. He moved in last semester.
It might be easier to reach him at KBRI.
He runs a disc-jockey show at night.
- Where is that?
- Municipal Building, top floor.
Thank you. You've been very helpful.
Dwight Powell, please.
Is this Dwight Powell?
I know what you did to Dory.
I know all about it.
Dory Kingship. You know very well who I mean.
Meet me at the Esquire Club, 11:00.
I'll tell you what I want.
What are you doing down there?
Get away from here, you!
Don't touch me.
Let me go. The police know I'm here.
- What are you talking about?
- Let me go.
Not till you tell me what this is about.
Did you phone me?
Take your hands off me!
Look, I'm Dwight Powell.
Who are you?
Let's go someplace
where there are people around.
Anyplace.
Tell me what this is all about.
You go first.
You did know her.
Sure, I went with her.
I met her in English Lit.
I liked her a lot,
but she started knitting socks for me.
I figured it was time
to check out, and I did.
Look, if I was a murderer...
do you think I'd let you out of that alley?
Please don't talk so loud.
All I know is you went for the bait.
You must have had some reason.
- Well, you...
- Not just to check on a crank phone call.
All right.
Listen. The fact is,
I thought your sister might have...
I thought she might have killed herself
because I stopped going with her.
I know it sounds ridiculous, conceited,
anything you want to call it.
Anyhow, it's bothered me.
Maybe I've been a disc jockey for too long,
too many fan letters from kids.
And just spinning too many records.
All right, I apologize.
- So what was that bit about the police?
- They don't know about it.
You mean, you did this on your own?
I had to.
The man I would have called
just wasn't available.
- That was a real crazy chance, lady.
- You weren't supposed to see me.
All you had to do was show up.
That would tell me you knew Dorothy,
felt some guilt.
I'd have let the police take it from there.
I'll tell you what,
next time you let the police start it.
You called her Dory over the phone.
- What is that, a family name?
- You never called her that?
I knew who you meant when you said Kingship,
but never heard anyone call her Dory.
Somebody did. She mentioned it in her letter.
Could've been after we broke off.
She went with another guy.
Who? What's his name?
I don't know. Some guy she met on campus.
I never saw him.
Wait a minute.
I can find out easy enough, though.
- I've got his address at home.
- You do?
A couple of weeks after we broke off...
she called, invited me to a party
at her boyfriend's house.
I figured she wanted
to show me, so I didn't go...
but I wrote his address in my notebook.
All right, let's get it.
Come on. Hold it.
What are you going to do with it?
Don't worry. I've learned my lesson.
I'll take it to the police,
first thing in the morning.
Come on.
It's all right. Most of the fellows are out.
At the auditorium,
seeing last year's football photos.
I'll only be a minute.
Put it down, Dwight.
What are you gonna do?
Turn up the roller.
- No.
- Sit down.
Please.
- You can have the address book.
- Face the typewriter.
I'll tell her I couldn't find it.
I'll forget I ever saw you.
Turn around.
- Please.
- Hold steady.
Pretty simple.
Powell pushed the Kingship girl off the roof,
pressure got too great for him.
Suicide note's still in the typewriter,
if you want to take a look.
Case opened again, closed again.
But for good this time.
He actually had me believing him.
Dorothy believed him, too.
Must run in the family.
I was going to ask.
Would you like me to phone your father,
tell him about this?
Thanks. I'll phone him myself tonight.
Anything you'd care to say
about the local police, you'd be right.
You did it all.
And the terrible thing
is that if I'd known you were doing it...
I'd have stopped you.
Take Miss Kingship to her hotel.
Thank you.
Thank you, Brad.
Bill.
Ellen.
Hello, Dad.
You're all right?
Better.
Much better.
And you?
If you're better, I'm fine.
By the way, there's somebody waiting for you.
Bud?
In there.
Bud?
Hi, Ellen. How are you?
- Just fine.
- Good.
- The winner.
- It's a fixed race.
They're Kingship horses.
They do what you tell them to.
After Dad tells them it's okay.
You know, I think he'd do it, too, for you.
He has changed lately.
Then, maybe I have, too.
- I have something to do with it?
- Something?
No.
Everything.
I had to say it, because you wanted me to.
Your diabolic spell.
Not at all.
Our relationship
is a simple matter of chemistry.
Like attracts like.
Happens with minerals. Happens with people.
Basic formula.
People who like the same things,
like each other.
I was saying that to somebody
just the other day.
Really is uncanny.
Same taste in books and music...
And jokes. Don't forget jokes.
No good if you don't laugh
at the same things.
No good if you don't know
what the other one's thinking.
I thought the chemistry took care of that.
What I'm thinking
about goes back before that...
something about me you don't know.
- A dark past? How exciting.
- It is.
I'm a man with a shameful, sinister secret.
You know what it is?
I've never really been in love before.
Bud...
If this is going to embarrass you
or upset you in any way...
- It doesn't.
- If it does, we'll get a new formula and start again.
- I just want to tell you...
- Can't you wait?
I'm sorry.
Because I can wait.
I think that's
what I really wanted to tell you.
I'll wait.
I'll wait until you fall in love with me.
I'll even wait
until you tell me to stop waiting...
that it's useless, that it hasn't any point.
I can tell you that now.
There isn't a point
in either of us waiting any longer.
I don't want to.
The formula's still working, you know?
I'm in love, too...
for the very first time in my life...
with you.
Thirty-two rooms, Mother.
- You think...
- He'll get it.
Wait'll you see the swimming pool.
That where they'll announce the engagement?
Not in the pool, but around it,
probably the terrace.
Now, don't worry.
They'll love you. You'll see.
What is it?
That blouse, why did you wear
a thing like that?
I told you the kind of people
that would be here.
- I thought you'd like it.
- It's too late now.
Mrs. Corliss, how perfectly lovely you look.
Why, thank you, Ellen.
Thank you very much.
I hope you'll find your room comfortable.
We've put you near Bud.
Miss Ellen, the florist is still waiting.
- Okay.
- Go on. You tend to your party.
I'll take Mother upstairs.
Excuse me.
I'm not worried about the caviar.
Just be sure there's enough champagne.
- But all the florist wanted was your opinion.
- Is Miss Kingship at home?
- She is.
- Gordon.
Hello, Ellen. How are you?
You think you have troubles.
Where are those parking boys I ordered?
I certainly picked
a swell time to call, didn't I?
A hectic last minute, but the perfect day.
It's all to show off this.
That's a pretty ring.
Congratulations.
Now I know I picked the wrong time.
Suppose I give you a call
sometime tomorrow or the next day.
Don't you dare go.
Honestly, I think my business
is just a little out of tune...
with your festivities. It can wait.
If you think I'm going to
spend the afternoon wondering...
That's all I need.
Can you spare a minute?
Sure. Come in.
If I can spare a minute, so can you.
It concerns your sister's friend.
You know, the late disc jockey,
Dwight Powell.
Seems that he was quite a tennis player, too.
You know, I helped my uncle
wrap up that case.
I made the usual inquiries
to fill out the record.
There's one interesting fact
that just came straggling in.
It seems that on the day your sister died...
Dwight Powell was playing tennis
in a tournament in Mexico City.
He'd been there almost a week.
I don't believe it.
You'll have to.
His teammates dug up a news picture.
There he was.
And there was the date.
If he wasn't in Lupton,
he couldn't have killed her.
- If he didn't kill her, why kill himself?
- That's it.
So instead of murder and a suicide,
we have something else.
Two murders.
Do you want to go a step further?
- The man who killed Dorothy is still free.
- That's right.
I guess the next time I say I'd better go...
you'd better let me.
Actually, I gambled.
I thought I saw enough happiness there
to override most anything.
Anyway, as far as I'm concerned,
the case is just starting.
I'll keep you posted.
You're not leaving.
I have to. I think my minute's just about up.
I want you to meet somebody.
- Miss Ellen, I hate to bother you...
- Later, Bill.
This is the one, Gordon.
- Bud Corliss, Gordon Grant.
- How do you do?
How are you, Bud? Congratulations.
I've heard about you for quite some time.
In a certain amount of detail.
I don't believe we've met. Are you from here?
- No, I'm from Lupton.
- Lupton?
You beat all the local guests to the party?
I'd say that rates some kind of reward.
I'm not exactly that kind of guest, actually.
I'm unexpected,
unprepared and just on my way out.
I really do have to go.
Gordon just dropped by to give me a message.
- And to wish you both lots of happiness.
- Thank you very much.
Nice meeting you, Bud.
I'll be in touch, Ellen.
Mr. Kingship's office called.
Your father's on his way.
Thank heaven.
Now you can take your problems to him
and give me a chance to get ready.
He's a nice fellow.
- Have you known him long?
- I met him because of Dorothy.
- He knew her at the university.
- That probably explains it.
I had a feeling something upset you.
On a day like this,
I'm not going to be upset by anything.
And I'm not going to let you be.
- I really must hurry now.
- Darling...
You know that whatever concerns you,
concerns me.
That works both ways.
You'd better hurry, too,
if you're going to change.
- Would you fill her up with ethyl, please?
- Right.
Hello, operator? Long distance.
I want to put in a collect call
to Chief of Police Howard Chesser in Lupton.
2-5-4-2-7.
Right.
My name is Gordon Grant.
Would you check the oil? I
think it's a little low.
Right.
Hello, Charlie?
Is Uncle Howard there?
Put in about a 30-weight, too,
and check that left rear tire.
Hello, Howard? This is Gordon.
I just saw her.
And I just met the guy
she's going to marry, too.
What I wanted to tell you
was that I think I've seen him before.
There at the university.
I'll tell you the point.
The point is that
I think I've seen him with Dorothy Kingship.
His name is Bud Corliss.
That's right. C-O-R-L-I-S-S.
Now, look, let's be sure.
You call the Registrar's Office
and check with her. Right.
And then call me back.
All right. I'll wait around for an answer.
I'll be at the Chaplain Hotel.
You fellows in aluminum
are just as badly off as we are.
No more for me, thanks.
I can see the look in my wife's eye.
- We have to be leaving, too.
- So soon?
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly, Bud.
- Congratulations, nice to have met you.
- Thank you, Mr. Cratchet. Mr. Fairburn.
- Leo, you did all right. He's a fine boy.
- Thank you.
There's a Mr. Grant to see you.
He says it's important.
- Excuse me, please.
- I hope we can see you later.
Right.
- How are you today?
- Mr. Kingship.
When is it going to be, dear?
This Sunday, if we can clear the church.
They just didn't want to wait. I don't know.
Children seem so impatient these days.
I know in my time...
Shall I tell them about your time?
Better yet, shall I tell them about you?
Bud, that isn't fair.
Mother eloped.
No waiting at all.
Did he tell you he went
to the state university?
That's a simple question.
Simple and preposterous,
your whole implication.
I take it he didn't tell you.
- Why should he?
- Why wouldn't he?
Fellow engaged to one daughter
not mentioning he knew the other.
Knew her?
I wasn't aware your uncle discovered that.
No, that part came from me.
But he's checking on it now.
In other words, you had the gall...
to come here now, on an occasion like this,
with no proof at all. Why?
To find out whether you knew
that Bud Corliss knew Dorothy.
Of course he didn't.
- How do you know?
- Because he would have said so.
Thank you, sir.
That's all I wanted to hear you say.
Because if he did know her
and didn't mention it...
he must have had a reason.
Unless, of course,
he told Ellen and happened to bypass you.
We can certainly check on that.
- What do you mean?
- Ask her.
- No.
- Why not?
It's unthinkable, the whole thing.
- I know that boy.
- For how long?
- It's degrading to ask her a thing like that.
- The police don't see it that way.
I'm not the police, Mr. Grant.
I'm her father.
Then for that very reason,
please give it more serious consideration.
Mr. Grant...
Up until recently, Ellen and I have...
She's under the impression
that I'm trying to run her life.
I can't do it.
I won't do it.
If you won't...
then I'll have to do it for you.
Gordon, you didn't have
to get back after all.
I'm so glad.
I came looking for Dad
to tell him everyone was leaving.
I see.
You've told him about Powell.
Don't you think you should've let me do that?
Did you know that Bud knew Dorothy?
- Why are you asking me that?
- Did you? Did Bud ever tell you?
I want to know why
you're asking such a question.
I started it. I recognized Bud
when you introduced us.
It would've been a good time
to say we went to the same university...
but you didn't, because you didn't know.
- I didn't because it wasn't so.
- No.
Because he didn't tell you.
If he started this,
how eager you must have been to join him.
How you must have searched
for just such a lie.
You ruined Dorothy's life...
and my mother's.
And now you want to do the same for me.
It won't work.
Don't ever mention this to me again,
not any part of it...
not ever.
I'm sorry, Mr. Kingship...
but I'll see you again, sir.
Either to apologize humbly for being wrong...
or else to prove that I was right.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, and thanks again.
- It was a pleasure meeting you.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
That was the last.
It was a wonderful party, a real ball.
The things people do when they see happiness.
Did you notice that, too?
They left here glowing like Christmas trees.
I wonder if your father's gonna glow
when he gets the bill.
- Think we're worth it?
- A thousand times over.
I'm gonna have to give you
some lessons on economy.
- Do you want to go to dinner?
- Don't even mention it.
How about a show?
To tell you the truth, darling,
I'm absolutely exhausted all at once.
If you want to be early to the smelter
tomorrow, you better let me go tonight.
All right, off to bed with you then.
And pleasant dreams. Good night, darling.
The Kingship Mines.
- Larger, you thought, or smaller?
- No complaints.
This is your call, sir.
Good. It's from the restaurant
on the outskirts of town.
I'd like you to take it if you don't mind.
- Kingship speaking.
- This is the confirmation on it.
Corliss was Dorothy's boyfriend, all right.
The waitress says they came here often
for weeks before she died.
I see.
I'll call the Payson police
and have him picked up right away.
Yes.
Thank you, Chief.
Tell Miss Ellen I want to see her at once.
She's not at home.
She and Mr. Corliss drove out to the smelter.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
There's no danger
of anything happening to her up there.
Why, he doesn't even know we suspect him.
Ellen does.
- I'll have the car brought around right away.
- Good.
I'll phone the police,
tell them where we're going.
$2 million on wheels.
Hard to believe, isn't it,
$50,000 for a truck?
Of course, we get a slight discount
buying them by the gross.
Looks like the center of creation.
At the rate they're going,
they'll be in China for Easter Sunday.
They've been working this pit eight years.
Seven.
Darling, you sound like
you knew the Kingship Mine...
long before the Kingship girl.
It's not that.
It's just that mining of any kind
has always interested me...
ever since I can remember.
Like you said, two of a kind.
Opera, music...
You should have heard Dorothy
on the subject of Debussy and me.
I used to drag that girl to every concert.
I tried to see most of them, too.
Shall we go up?
- How were the concerts in Lupton?
- Not bad for a town that...
That was some time ago.
They're probably even better today.
Look at that.
I've seen it.
I think we'd better be getting back now.
I can't go on like this.
I've got to know.
- You mean about Lupton?
- Yes.
Did I go to the university?
Did I know your sister?
I did.
I even had a few dates with her.
Why didn't you tell me?
All right, I will.
When I transferred up here
and happened to meet you...
I saw right away what you were going through.
By telling you,
would that have helped you forget?
- But later...
- Later.
Later we fell in love...
and I knew I mustn't tell you.
I'd be chaining you to a constant reminder
of grief every time you looked at me.
I'd be putting a curse on both of us.
- I suppose that I should have...
- I still don't understand.
- If it was only innocent, you...
- What did you say?
If it was innocent? If it was?
- I didn't mean that...
- Is that what your love is like?
Is that a sample
of your faith in me, your trust?
Please wait.
Who put you up to this? Grant?
He probably saw me with her once.
What an operator.
He drives all the way up here
to tell you that.
It was to tell me about Powell.
- The fellow who killed your sister?
- Except that he didn't.
He didn't kill himself.
He was killed
by the same man who killed Dorothy.
How do they know such a thing?
They're bluffing.
He left a note. It said it all there.
They didn't find anybody.
How do they even know your sister was killed?
They're guessing.
Powell was about to give me
the murderer's address.
The murderer knew that.
He overheard us in that bar.
He just happened to be there?
He didn't just happen to be there.
He'd followed me.
He followed me since I'd arrived in town.
That's even crazier. How could he?
Known I was in Lupton?
I sent him a message telling him so.
Remember?
You think you know.
I'm telling you you're wrong.
These things are coincidence,
one after another.
Me knowing her, the university.
So did a hundred other guys.
You're tall and slender.
- That was in her letter.
- What letter?
- Right beside me all along.
- What does it mean? Nothing.
- Dory knew a dozen...
- Dory.
There weren't a dozen called her Dory.
There was only one.
Why did you have to do this?
To me, to yourself?
Most of these things you've said,
the police don't even know.
They do.
No.
They don't.
Or I wouldn't be here, would I?
And you wouldn't be here with me.
I put my whole life into this,
everything I ever wanted, right here.
I can't give it up.
You're insane.
Can't you see that?
You can't go any further.
Your father and I, we'll grieve together.
We'll have that to share between us, too.
Let me go!
There.
Okay, let's go.
