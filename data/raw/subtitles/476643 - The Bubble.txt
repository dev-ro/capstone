This is a restricted area.
No filming here.
Show me an order, please.
lt's enough that l say so.
-No, it isn't.
l said stop filming!
Hey, watch it.
Hands off, please.
Sir, sir!
A bus.
Make them stop,
then come to the bus.
Stay alert.
You're pissing me off.
Whatever.
Come on, everybody off.
Quickly, we don't have all day.
Everybody get in two lines.
All the men,
pull your shirts up slowly.
You can't film here.
-Really? Says who?
lt's not up to me,
you heard the officer.
l'm sorry,
you can't just censor us like this.
Whatever. l don't care.
Next.
Good.
Next.
l said slowly, so l can see.
Next.
You with the belly,
show me what you have there.
l don't understand. What does he want?
Let him see your belly.
Don't you understand?
Do as he says.
Good. -Fuck them.
Stay calm, Jihad.
Now take out your lD's and move on.
Help us, please!
Her water broke,
she needs help. Please.
Call an ambulance!
Tell her l'm a medic, l can help.
He's like a doctor. Don't be scared.
Send an ambulance.
There's a woman in labor here.
She can't breathe!
Relax. -Where's the ambulance?
The ambulance is coming.
Don't be afraid.
Reassure her.
-l did.
She's giving birth!
Ask her where it hurts.
Where does it hurt?
The pain is terrible!
What is he doing?
Where is the doctor?
Stop it, you're scaring her.
How long for the ambulance?
The doctor's here.
What's going on?
-She's in labor.
Hello, l'm the doctor.
Don't worry, l'll take care of you.
The baby's coming legs first.
Push, push, help me!
Push. Push!
-Help me. Harder. Harder.
One more push and he's out.
-One more, one more.
He's out!
Something is wrong.
Where is my son?
She wants the baby.
-Give him CPR.
Pulse?
-No.
OK, starting CPR.
l'm sorry.
He has no pulse.
Where is my son?
There is nothing we can do.
You killed that baby!
You killed him!
Have you no shame?
Enough of that, Jihad.
-Stay out of it.
Don't you even care?
Everybody back in line.
Nothing happened here.
Back in line.
Get your lDs ready, come on.

A film by Eytan Fox
The Bubble
"The Third Ear"
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Do you have
the new Britney compilation?
Who's that?
lt's called "My Prerogative".
And the DVD too.
What's a "Prerogative"?
lt's her new video.
She's got blond hair.
Don't know it. How about
the new Rolling Stones set?
Open your ears a bit.
Yeah, right.
Let's get out of here.
Bad time there?
Yes?
l like the atmosphere here.
No uniforms, chilled-out waiters,
l think l'll fit in perfect.
l've been here a few times.
Sometimes it takes half an hour
to get a table, but it's worth it.
The sweet potato pancakes
and the rice pilaf!
l know the owners
are girls,
so all the waiters are boys...
But that's so over.
Why pass on a girl like me?
l ran a bar in Netanya,
but l don't mind
starting from the bottom.
ln two months
l'll be running the place.
But l run the place.
-We'll run it together. No problem.
Or l can open a branch
at the Azrieli Mall.
l was there yesterday.
They don't have one.
We're not a franchise.
There's only this branch.
So think big!
Golan is here now!
The last one wasn't bad.
That small-town boy?
You can't be serious.
He's so not our type.
Maybe it's time to change our type.
Don't all our waiters
look like brothers?
That's a thought.
Yali, if you like him,
then date him.
But don't lecture us, OK?
What's up?
-Our soldier's back.
lt's him?
-Yeah.
l need a few minutes.
-Take your time. l'm here.
So, what's new here?
What about your new guy?
-What about him?
No progress.
l haven't even seen him yet.
Why should it progress?
Has the world progressed?
lt actually has.
-No, it hasn't.
All guys want
the morning after is to run.
They don't want any baggage
or commitment.
The only way to avoid that
is to take it slow.
So when the male instinct whispers:
"Run, she's clinging!"
He'll remember those walks
on the beach
and the movies we saw,
and maybe he'll reconsider
and stick around.
How long have you been holding out?
-Three weeks.
lsn't three weeks
taking it a bit too slow?
l don't know why Sharon has
this effect on you,
Miss "lsraeli Carrie Bradshaw".
But if you want to keep him,
it's time to give it up.
Really?
And the guys
on your reserve duty?
Nothing to tell.
-No one?
No sexy suicide bombers?
Don't start.
l won't go back,
l swear.
Hi, Sharon... Busy?
An editorial meeting?
Nothing special.
Why don't you come over tonight?
Yes, my place.
You've been wanting to, right?
Maybe we could rent a DVD.
No, l don't really
feel like going out.
Why?
Oh, my roommates?
Going to Sinai.
They're going to Sinai.
IsraeIi Pop IdoI
l can't believe
you're watching that crap.
Don't exaggerate.
We're not really going.
Call my mother,
tell her you like the food.
She brought it just for you.
You look great!
Time to go!
-ln a second. -You can't stay.
Just to see Mr. Editor.
Noam is dying to.
No.
l found your lD.
l thought you might need it.
l didn't notice, thank you.
Come in.
My roommates,
Yali, Lulu. This is...
l'm Ashraf.
Ashraf was with me on duty.
l mean, that's where we met.
What's up?
ls this a bad time?
We're just the roommates.
l'm Yali. This is Noam.
And that's Ashraf.
Ashraf?
Nice to meet you all.
Weren't you in a hurry, boys?
You might miss your bus.
Yali, we're going for cash first.
Meet us by the Eilat platform.
l'll just be a second...
l forgot my snorkel.
Tel Aviv, Ashraf.
Ashraf, Tel Aviv.
The sea is over there,
but you can't see it.
The European idiots
who built the city in the 1 920s
didn't know much
about the Mediterranean.
They put its back
to the sea.
Streets run parallel
to the sea and block the breeze.
Then the tall hotels
blocked everything.
That's why there's no air.
Are you sweating?
l'm sweating.
l'm really sweating.
Maybe Yali packed those towels
he stole from the gym.
So that's how Jews kiss.
Don't you like it?
Sure l do.
But l thought we could...
Take it farther?
Yeah, take it farther.
Golan?
Great shirt.
Yes, l know.
So many fags.
-Problem?
l hate them.
l'm gay. l'm not a girl.
We're all free.
They like being feminine.
Are you joking?
Who wants to be a biter?
A biter? Pillow biter...
Never heard that?
So you're a fudge packer?
Just joking.
Don't be so touchy.
So naive.
What are these?
-l designed them.
They're nice.
-Just T-shirts for my friends.
But l'm actually serious
about fashion design.
l'm thinking of studying
in New York next year.
New York is the best.
-So l've heard.
Maybe l'll go to Paris.
Albert Elbaz started in NY,
got famous,
and then moved to Paris
to become the designer for Lanvin.
But he's some kind of genius,
isn't he?
And you think l'm not?
Of course you are.
l'm sure you can make it.
There are so many talented people
in Tel Aviv.
All you need is to get out
into the world,
and make a name for yourself.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
So why do you look scared?
What are you afraid of?
-You, kind of.
You're scared of me?
Never mind, forget it.
Forget it?
Forget it.
So, that's how Arabs do it.
Don't you like it?
Sure l do.
l just thought maybe
we could take it farther.
lt was awful.
Us? Didn't you...
Not us.
That woman at the checkpoint.
Lots of stories like that.
Jihad, the guy near me
at the checkpoint...
He's engaged to my sister.
His father had a heart attack.
His ambulance was stopped at checkpoint.
They searched it.
They held it for an hour.
He died at the hospital entrance.
lf they hadn't stopped him...
You know why they have checkpoints?
They weren't always there.
Don't start your propaganda.
Forget politics.
You thought l said we were awful?
-Maybe.
We were explosive!
Explosive?
Don't you know that word?
l know it. When you explode
something, like a bomb.
lt can mean cool, too.
Explosive, explosion, explode.
Good sex is explosive.
Explosive.
No Sharon for breakfast?
-He went spinning before work.
Morning spinning. What a catch!
Delicious!
People forget how sexy
a simple sliced tomato can taste.
My battery's out.
Can l use your phone?
Sure.
Thanks.
ls he staying?
Where can he go?
He has no permit.
lf he's caught, they'll arrest him
and send him back.
Are we going to keep him
in the closet?
Stop it.
Being gay isn't easy
over there.
l don't want to stay.
l won't marry Jihad's cousin.
Why are they pushing me?
Take it easy.
Where are you now?
ln Jerusalem, at a friend's house.
They'll kill me if they find out.
What? Who will kill you?
Are you mad?
Who is she anyway? Do l know her?
She's a Christian... and a divorcee.
Does she have kids?
Kids? No, no.
So how are you doing?
I miss you.
l miss you too.
Don't worry,
we'll see each other soon.
l took my last exam today.
l'm leaving Jordan in a few days.
Are you sure about him?
He's become so extreme.
He could cause trouble for us.
Listen, he's the man l love.
Jihad is a sensible guy.
He promised to stop soon.
After the wedding, we'll be
far from all that, here in Jordan.
What are you doing?
l'm reminding you:
"The roommates agree to uphold
a strict guest policy.
"A hook-up lasting
more than one week...
"Hoping there wouldn't be
such a case...
"This would require the approval
of all roommates.
"Maximum stay is two weeks.
"1 4 nights, then he must go."
Yali, all we ever do is talk.
How many times did we promise my mom
we'd go to Checkpoint-Watch?
This is a chance
to do something important.
ls this a political affair?
Stop it!
We can help someone.
OK! l won't be accused
of killing the lsraeli left.
l surrender!
Good.
What do you think awaits
a gay suicide bomber in heaven?
Seventy virgin twinks
or seventy muscle hunks?
Think he can choose?
Golan, l'm really sorry,
Orna owes this guy a favor.
l know what l said yesterday.
l'm really sorry.
Someone leaves every month.
You're next on the list.
No, l just said hi
to the security guard.
"Orna & Ella"
Another date? Let's talk later.
Do you have the
Pop ldol CD?
Of course. How could we not?
There, on the right.
See what 24 hours
on Sheinkin St can do?
You're a new man!
Probably got some last night...
Does it show?
-Good for you, man.
Can l help you?
-Not right now, thanks.
Hey, what's up?
Still in the editorial meeting?
OK, later. No problem.
This color is so Arabic.
Smells Arabic too.
Excuse me, what's in this soap?
Don't you like it?
Sorry, l don't.
Our policy is only
great-smelling soaps.
Customers aren't allowed
to criticize our soaps.
l don't like your tone.
That soap smells better than you do.
How dare you!
Who do you think you are?
l apologize.
She didn't mean it.
Let's get out of here.
l need some fresh air.
-Take your time, chill.
Hey sweetie!
Hi.
Chiki's in the house,
wipe off the sour face.
l have to get out of there.
l'm wasting time.
That job isn't forever.
Never mind.
The bastard is screening my calls!
-What?
Nothing, forget it.
Look at the cool stickers we made.
Can l stick one here?
-No, crazy!
Outside, or they'll think l did it.
"Rave Against the Occupation"
Cool, it's better with the sleeves
rolled up.
Are you sure?
Do these colors work?
He has to dress right
to work at the cafe.
Orna and Ella
don't know the truth.
He needs a belt.
He also needs a new name
and a whole new biography.
Wow, this belt looks great.
Don't move.
l always had fantasies
about George Michael.
l had fantasies
about the entire wall.
You liked George Michael?
Who did you fantasize
about at 1 5?
River Phoenix, Morrissey,
Chris Lowe from the Pet Shop Boys...
There were a lot.
Him and that sad little indie world
of those suffering singers!
Jerk! You love what l play.
And the minute you leave
he puts on "Take That".
Jason Orange!
Jason Orange,
the sweet hard-ons of high school.
Jason, the sweet dancer,
l was so in love with him.
When they broke up l wanted to go
to London and find him.
Wait a minute,
who did you like in "Take That"?
Robbie, of course.
And you?
You're such an awful snob!
Actually we're missing a picture
of Michel Foucault,
to replace Stephen from Boyzone.
-Shut up.
What's wrong? A little culture,
some tradition...
We're all one people that way,
at least.
l can't wear that.
That's much better.
My clothes work best on him.
But there's not much
to choose from.
Ashraf, follow me.
My dear, l sense
your mood is not fabulous,
but l can make it better.
Allow me to interest you
in my new script.
lt's a fascinating story.
-l'd be delighted.
l know you are writing
the part just for me.
No other actress in town
could play such a role.
Waiter!
One second.
Stick close to me,
and repeat everything l say.
Good evening.
No, no...
That's exactly what we don't do.
Be casual.
Thank you very much, you're sweet.
What's your name?
Oh, what should we call him?
He needs a Hebrew name.
l worked for an lsraeli contractor.
He gave us all Hebrew names.
He called me Shimi.
Shimi, like Shimon, right?
Or short for Samson.
"Let my soul die
with the Philistines".
History's first suicide bomber.
Stop it.
Why not?
l am Shimi.
Want some Kebab, Hummus, Tehina?
How come you don't have an accent?
No broblem, if you want
l bring it right back.
l take your bicture?
We no habe work, no habe money,
we just want the beace, really.
l didn't mean that, you know.
lt's OK. lt's really unusual.
When l was young l worked at my
uncle's souvenir shop in Jerusalem.
We had Jewish customers,
so l learned.
l thought it might be useful.
My uncle used to joke: "this one
talks like a Jew, that's no good".
You must try our famous
sweet potato pancakes.
Here are the shirts.
Alright people, let's sit down.
We have a lot to discuss.
Be careful with the chairs.
l promised we'd leave this place
in good shape.
The slave labor arrives
at 5 AM to clean up anyway.
Don't start arguing.
Yes, let's save the arguments
for another time.
Ladies and Gentlemen: The Plan.
We leave Tel Aviv
in a convoy of cars.
We'll drive up toward
Tel-Baruch Beach.
And make our way
to the rave location!
Question.
What about the police? -l don't think
we'll have any trouble.
The police only look for raves
in the desert.
They came last time,
they could come again.
lf they show up this time,
we must fight back. -Fight back!
Hold on.
Now my idea for the poster.
"Rave Against the Occupation"
l want everybody naked,
wearing only fig leaves.
l used the colors of the Palestinian
and lsraeli flags.
Maybe we can do without those colors,
to draw a bigger crowd.
We could always use the flags
of Denmark and Sweden.
They're pretty
and they don't piss anybody off.
Don't be so cynical.
All l'm saying is,
the poster doesn't need
the old politics.
lt can be more subtle:
we're young and against war.
Where? ln New Zealand?
Maybe we should invite
some Palestinians.
We never have any.
We haven't succeeded.
Anyone know
any young Palestinians
who can come to our meetings?
Yeah, right. This is bullshit!
How could they come?
They can't get permits!
You're all so disconnected!
You're living in denial.
Go to the checkpoints!
Ever been to the West Bank?
And you?
l just spent a month on reserve duty
at a checkpoint.
You didn't refuse?
Hey, we're here for the poster.
Talk politics later.
Bye, Lulu.
Want one?
There are lots left.
The shirts are great.
You're really talented.
Thanks.
So where are you going now?
For a drink with the boys.
OK, so l'll see you.
Cool place, right?
Golan's coming.
Don't mention Shimi works at the cafe.
He'll kill me.
What's this?
lt's a new production of "Bent."
-"Bent?"
Yeah, it's a famous play.
A love story about two men
in a concentration camp.
lt's with Lior Ashkenazi.
Yummy! We've got to go!
Do you like theater?
l do. But l've never seen
a play in Hebrew.
What's up, bro?
Meet my friends, Lulu, Noam.
l told you about them.
And this is Shimi, Noam's friend.
ls your friend Palestinian?
Your shorts look
a bit Palestinian.
Sorry about Golan.
He got out of the army two years ago,
but he still has the mentality
of a Golani trooper.
And proud of it! Golan,
a Golani trooper forever!
Maybe his trooper friends should know
what he does at night.
Sister, my friends know exactly
what l do.
l came out like a man
and they took it like men.
These are my brothers, sweetheart.
We busted our asses together,
fought terrorists in the Hebron Casbah.
Believe me...
ln the trenches, any minute some
dog might shoot you from behind...
You learn it doesn't matter.
As long as he's protecting you,
who cares if he's straight or gay?
l need a drink.
Anyone coming along?
No, we'll stay.
We hate Arabs too.
Did l say something wrong?
Your friends don't like army talk?
What can l get you?
l'm leaving.
-What happened?
"1 4-Year-Old Boy Killed in Jenin
by Occupation Forces"
What are you doing?
Just reading news from home.
What's going on there?
-The usual stuff.
Come on, pound me!
Pound me?
Pound me!
Problem?
l don't know...
-Consummate sound better?
Sexual intercourse?
Then just nail me from behind!
You're so drunk.
lt's not from the wine!
Not in the hallway, bro.
Who's that woman?
My mother.
Where does she live?
She doesn't. She's dead.
l'm sorry.
-lt's OK.
We used to live in Jerusalem.
Fuck me! Fuck me!
l want to be your whore.
Yes! Yes, Mama! Yes!
Fuck me.
Yes, Mama! Yes!
Fuck me, Mama, fuck me!
Mama...
Fuck me.
-l want to be your whore.
Perverts.
Mama! Mama!
l'll ask his army friends
to pound you.
Bring them on, l'm getting hot.
Please.
Good morning Sheinkin Street!
We would like to invite you
to the best party in town.
A rave against the occupation.
A rave for peace.
You are all welcome to come
to the rave on October 23.
We don't need the territories,
we need to dance!
Rave against the occupation!
A party for peace!
We all want peace, right?
We all want the same thing.
Dance! Dance! Dance!
A rave for peace, let's all show up.
Let's dance instead of shoot!
Let's all show up.
Don't you ever learn?
Don't you ever change?
The new generation wants peace.
-What do you know?
Ever had an 8-year-old's leg fall
on your face after a bombing?
Make them stop pushing me.
They're hitting me.
They're crazy.
Animals!
l could punch them!
Morons.
Are you OK?
-Better now.
l'm on the verge of losing it.
What are you talking about?
-l'm sick of everything.
"Time Out
Tel Aviv"
Come on.
Lulu?! What's up with her?
Lulu.
Where's Sharon?
-End of the hall, to the right.
ls he expecting you?
-He should be.
Hey, how are you?
Fuck you.
That's how l am.
What kind of talk is that?
Fuck you, loser.
Who do you think you are?
Take it easy.
Shut up. You think you're
"50 Cent" and l'm your bitch?
Why did you chase me
for a month?
Just to get laid, run off
and avoid my calls?
What kind of behavior is that?
l came here to tell you
about a porn site.
lt's for the world's
smallest dicks.
They'll pay a fortune for yours.
Let's go.
They call it the "bubble",
because nothing here is real.
Look around. These people
have no connection to reality.
Kibbutz life is a bubble, too.
West Bank settlements are bubbles.
Who can say anymore
what's real and what's a bubble?
Maybe...
You're new here?
-Yes.
So this is for you.
-Thank you.
What's your name?
-Shimi.
Shimi. A pretty name for a pretty boy.
Everything cool?
-Look at the tip l got.
She pulls that trick
on every new waiter.
Once she finds out you're gay,
she'll go back to being cheap.
Someone's here for you.
Hello.
-Hey.
You're new here?
That lady just pulled that
on me.
At least she left me a nice tip.
Tips are nice.
But l've got something better.
Tonight, after the photo shoot
for Lulu's poster,
l'm taking you to the theater.
Listen, do you...
What?
Miss it?
What?
You know.
Yes.
-We don't have to.
What?
Miss it. We're here together.
We don't have to miss it.
We can't look at each other.
We can't touch.
We can feel...
-Feel what?
Each other. Without looking.
Without touching.
l can feel you right now. Next to me.
Can you feel me?
Maybe.
Don't worry.
He won't hear us. Feel me.
No.
-l'm touching you.
lt's burning.
-l'm kissing you.
Burning
-Kissing your lips.
Hot.
-Kissing your eyes.
Yes.
-lnside your mouth.
Yes.
-Neck.
Yes.
-Down.
Yes.
-Down.
Yes.
-Do you feel my mouth?
Do you feel my cock?
-Yes.
Do you know what l am doing?
-Yes.
Can you taste what l am doing?
-Yes.
Together.
-Together.
Do you feel me?
-l want you inside me.
Feel.
-l have you inside me.
lnside.
-Strong.
l'm going to...
-Strong.
Do you feel... l'm going to...
-Strong.
Strong.
-Yes.
Strong.
-Yes.
Oh, my God! Oh...
Did you?
Yes.
You?
-Yes.
You're a good lay.
-So are you.
Max?
-What?
We did it.
How about that. Fucking guards,
fucking camp, we did it.
We were real.
We made love.
They're not going to kill us.
l like that thing they did,
running a finger over their eyebrow,
instead of saying "l love you."
Luckily we don't need that.
Maybe in Tel Aviv you don't.
Where are you from in Jerusalem?
-French Hill.
Really?
You know l used to live in lssawiya.
Really?
How come you never told me?
l was very young when we left,
l don't remember much.
Maybe we were neighbors.
-Yeah, something like that.
My father was born there,
all his family is from Jerusalem.
So you have an lsraeli lD?
-l used to.
We used to live
at my grandparents' house.
When my younger sister was born,
it got crowded.
So my father started building us
a new house.
He borrowed money,
opened his savings account.
Built the house himself,
with family and friends.
lt was coming along great.
My sister and l used to run around,
deciding who would get which room.
And then we got
a demolition warrant.
And what happened?
-What happened?...
One day a tractor came
and tore it all down.
My mom stood outside screaming,
but nothing helped.
Within an hour, it was gone.
What did you do?
-l was just a kid, what could l do?
l threw rocks at the tractor.
But my father stopped me.
That evening he told us we were
moving to a place that was our own.
We left. Returned our lDs
and moved to Nablus.
My mother argued with him.
She said lsraeli lDs
would be good to have.
But my father refused.
He couldn't take it.
You scared me.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
l didn't think there was
anything to see.
So, how was the play?
lnteresting,
lots of food for thought.
You should go.
Yeah, as l said pretty clearly
at the Breakfast Club,
l really want to see it.
Oh...
-Never mind, it's no big deal.
Yali, l'm so sorry,
l totally forgot.
Forget it. Focus on yourself.
You do that so well.
What's that mean?
lt means what it means.
-Do you want to talk about it?
l don't have anything to say.
-OK.
l just think
that something isn't right.
lt's not right that l'm happy?
-Of course you're happy...
lf he's not straight,
or in a relationship, or a tourist,
at least let him be...
Never mind, let's change the subject.
Come on, say it.
How should l put it? We've always
tried to keep away from politics.
We don't go to checkpoints
with Lulu's mom.
We try to just live and...
Don't you get it?
Sorry to rain on your parade, but...
He's really sweet and l watch
over him at the cafe but...
Somehow it doesn't feel real.
So what do you suggest?
l don't know, Noam.
Just more food for thought.
l'll talk to him about the nudity,
it'll be fine.
Don't you trust me?
Leave it to me.
OK, he's here. Bye.
What's up?
-How are you?
There you go.
-For me, a double espresso, thanks.
l'll have a Corona.
No problem.
So, what is this about?
Alright. As l told you,
it's our Spring Special.
Every celebrity we choose
gets a two-page spread,
and recommends the hottest
things of the hour.
And you get the cover.
-Who's in it?
Artists. Celebs.
People of the hour.
You, with your new play, "Bent."
Camilla, the winner from
"Big Brother".
Mali Levi, with her
new jeans campaign, you know.
What concept did you have in mind?
-lt'll be a huge production.
You, in the center, naked.
Around you, fifteen naked girls...
Did you even see the play?
-Of course l did. Quality stuff.
But hey. The play is one thing
and the Spring Special is another.
Face it. The Holocaust is not sexy.
And my cover has to be sexy.
Yeah, l guess the Holocaust
isn't that sexy.
There you go.
-Thanks.
How are you?
-Excuse me?
Don't you remember me?
-Remind me.
You remember,
we met at Lulu's apartment,
and then at Time Out.
You must remember that.
Maybe you're confusing me
with someone else.
Don't be scared.
l wanted to talk to you
about doing a story.
"Tel Aviv through the eyes
of a Palestinian."
Excuse me a moment.
Yali, l'm sorry, l have to...
Where did he go?
l hope l didn't scare him.
What did you say to him?
Just that l want to do
a story about him.
A story about him?
You got any more Palestinians
working here?
We could do a group piece.
-What?
They're all legal, right?
-What do you mean?
He's gone.
OK...
Maybe we'll talk
about it some other time.
Why didn't you tell us, silly?
Open the window,
My darIing one
Let the wind bIow in
Mix the outside with the inside...
My God, it stinks in here.
You need air.
Your crotch smell is all over town.
The neighbors are asking
if there's a corpse in here.
Look, sweetie,
hop into the shower.
Take a walk,
then go back to bed.
Diet-wise, it's great. Like a double
Yom Kippur. Cleans the blood wonderfully.
l'll give you some onion pills
to totally clean your system.
lt's your mom.
Yes, mom.
l turned mine off for a sec.
No, Ashraf isn't here.
He went back
to Nablus, why?
Today in NabIus
Air Force Apache heIicopters fired
missiIes at a car
driven by RiyaI Bek,
Ieader of the miIitary arm
of Hamas.
Security officiaIs cIaim that
Bek was part of an attempt
to Iaunch IocaI ceIIs
of AI-Qaeda.
Hamas vowed to avenge...
No answer.
l keep sending him messages.
l don't know what to do.
What do we do about him?
Tell me...
Do you think l can pass for a
TV reporter going to the territories?
Someone like Christiane Amanpour?
Have you gone crazy too?
l have an idea.
l have a great idea.
"Rave against the occupation"
Shaul.
Shaul.
l wanted to bring you one,
but l thought it would be cooler
if you saw them already up.
They look good.
-Good? They looks great.
Thanks to you.
You're the best.
Thanks.
Listen, l would love to stay
and help, but l have to run.
Anything happen?
Actually, a lot's happened.
l'll tell you some other time.
Promise?
-Promise.
Sharon? The trouble girl
is on her way to your office.
lt's OK, she's here.
l'll take care of it.
What do you want?
Don't make me call the police.
Chill, you have a chance
to help me and get a cease-fire.
Help you with what?
-l need press cards.
Press cards?
-Yes, temporary cards.
Like the ones you got us
for the rock gig.
You can cut out these pictures.
We need to get through checkpoints.
We're going to Nablus.
-Nablus?
Yes. To do a story.
About what?
About how Palestinian men act
the morning after.
Don't start that again.
Yali did a great job with the car.
l'm telling you, he could be
an art director in movies.
He said to put this up in front.
-He put a lot of work into this.
But he bailed out on the trip.
lt's impossible
to get him out of Tel-Aviv.
We should switch to English.
We can't use Hebrew there.
Sounds bad. They'll know
immediately you're lsraeli.
Do a French accent.
No one will know.
You're crazy, l can't talk like that.
There's the checkpoint.
l hope no one recognizes me.
Next in line. Move on.
Put down the suitcase.
Open the suitcase.
Take it out.
Give it to me.
Sorry.
What's that?
lt's Henna, for the wedding.
Give it to me. Let me see.
You sure it's Henna?
Henna.
Check if it's Henna.
lt is.
-You can pack.
Close the door.
What are you doing here?
You want them to kill me?
l was worried about you.
l'm sorry, l wanted to call back.
You don't know
what it's like here.
l'm sorry.
You're really crazy.
Jihad!
Wait. You can't tell anyone.
l never thought you were one of those.
Promise me you won't tell!
l won't ruin the most
beautiful week of your sister's life.
Did you invite them?
No. They'll leave. -Now!
Make them leave! -Promise me.
Till the wedding.
After that, only Allah knows.
My cousin Samira
will be at the wedding.
You must marry her.
lf you do, maybe l won't say anything.
Why do this? -lt's that way.
Welcome.
l missed you.
Welcome.
Are you OK?
Are you sure? l was so scared.
Let me speak to him.
Don't you see he's a wreck?
You must come to the rave.
Know where it is?
He misses you terribly.
She's right. l really do.
Why didn't you invite Golan?
He doesn't fit in.
-Why not?
But l'll find someone.
Plenty to choose from.
What a relief.
And you, Mr. Depression?
-What about me?
Have some MDMA.
What for?
For fun, dummy.
You did it!
-What do you mean?
Fashionably late Comrade Ashraf.
What an entrance.
You're getting bitchy!
l'm only kidding.
Aren't jokes allowed anymore?
l'm so happy you came.
-l didn't think l would make it.
The checkpoints took hours,
then getting into lsrael,
hitchhiking through the mountains,
and then...
you don't need the details.
l'm really happy you're here.
Hey, what are you doing here?
ls this a private party?
Got a strict door policy?
No, l'm glad you came but...
Because it's a rave?
l'm into causes, too.
l'm totally left-wing, bro.
See you.
l saved us some.
l thought you might come.
l'm so happy you came.
Open wide.
Say ah!
You're such a sucker.
That's the first trick
in Golan's book.
l dance with someone else...
You get jealous and come crawling.
What do you want?
Stop being so heavy.
Dance with me, man!
Did it kick in?
What?
Yeah, l guess it did.
Go get her...
She's not waiting for me.
You know, l love you.
-Really?
Really.
And l want us to make love.
And then get married,
and have lots of children.
Are you rolling on X?
No, it's real.
lt's not because l'm high.
l really feel it.
OK.
l'll decide later if l join you
or let you do it alone.
Remember the playground
between French Hill and lssawiya?
Yeah, the Jews' playground.
We never went there.
At first, all the kids played there,
until we were about 6 years old.
Maybe we even played there together.
l don't think so,
l would have spotted you.
l'm joking.
My father was our
neighborhood committee president.
There were complaints about Arab kids
scaring the other kids.
So he got an order preventing the
lssawiya kids from playing there.
My mother had a terrible fight
with him.
She invited all the mothers
and kids from lssawiya
to come to a reconciliation party
at the playground.
My father laughed at her
"attempt at World Peace."
He said no one would come.
And on the day of the party,
no one did.
Not even the lsraeli mothers.
Later we found out
they were scared off.
We sat there drinking juice
and eating cake.
She pushed me high on the swings.
Back home, my father and brother
were watching soccer on TV.
Later, in the bath, l noticed
my Mom had tears in her eyes.
She was trying to wipe them away,
so l pretended l didn't see them.
l know it sounds crazy,
but l think that was the day
the illness began in her body.
Somehow, l'm sure of that.
l just love the city
on Saturday mornings.
Tel Aviv has such beautiful moments.
Yeah, like now,
when everything is quiet and calm.
l really love Tel Aviv.
lt's a shame it's surrounded
by such crap.
lf we could only make
all the politics disappear.
Why didn't you invite Shaul?
-What for?
We saw you two.
lt seemed so nice and romantic.
And what about Golan?
Don't change the subject,
we're talking about Shaul.
He was high on X.
-High on you!
What's the matter? He's sexy.
-He was wasted.
"l swear it's not
because l'm rolling.
"l'm in love with you, you're beautiful
and l really wanna fuck you.
"ls anal an option?"
Can you really play?
-Sure.
l wanted to be a rock star.
Really?
ln high school,
we even had a band, "The Sirens."
We used to cover classics.
Do you know Tim Buckley?
No.
During the army l quit music
and never really came back to it.
And now it's too late.
lt's not too late. We're still young.
You can do anything you want.
At my age?
-"At my age?"
Very funny.
Come on, sing something.
l want to hear you sing.
Come on.
-Really?
Yeah?
This is a song my mother loved,
she always wanted me
to play it for her.
You don't have to.
l want to.
Wait a second.
What was her name?
-Whose name?
Your mother's.
Sarah.
Her name was Sarah.
I wanted to say
"my Iove" in Arabic,
but you never taught me how.
Anyway, I'm off to work.
Have a nice trip back.
Have fun at the wedding.
And say "MazaI Tov" to your sister.
Maybe you shouIdn't say
it's from me.
But come back to me soon.
Very soon.
How did you sleep?
-Like a rock. You?
Me too.
Excuse me,
is this lemon or lemongrass?
l can't really tell from here
but it says on the label.
What's up?
Remember what l told you
last night?
l was totally wasted,
l don't remember much.
l said l wanted us
to get married, have kids.
You said l was just high.
Don't you remember?
Sort of.
Well, it's true.
l want us to be together.
What? Right now?
From this very second?
Yes.
OK. But do we really have
to get married?
l'm not up for the whole
religious thing. No way.
You're the boss.
lt's OK. Your not bothering me,
l'm just smelling soap.
Stop, not here.
l'm going to "Erez" for bread.
l'll come back later.
Go on, it's very sweet.
Alright.
Come on.
Put down the bags.
Come on. Come on.
Open the bags so the soldier
can see what's in there.
Come on, let's see.
Have your lDs ready.
Excuse me, soldier,
these people are guests coming
to my sister's wedding.
Maybe you could please...
-What are they to you?
They're guests
for my sister's wedding.
Where are you from?
Nablus.
Hello, Ashraf.
Welcome.
Sorry for the delay.
Don't worry,
they'll let you through in a minute.
You'll be on time, God willing.
What does he want?
l don't know.
Ashraf Sirtawi from Nablus.
Stay out of this.
Get in line with the others.
-Hey, l was just explaining...
You understand Hebrew, right?
Get in line
before l have you detained.
They're my sister's guests...
Stand aside! Am l clear?
How are you, gorgeous?
Thank God you're here!
What's up?
Jihad hasn't arrived yet.
Stop worrying. He'll be here soon.
Jihad's mother was here
and she started talking about
naming our baby after Jihad's father.
What baby?
l have so much to do before that.
l need to find work,
finish my studies,
make sure we have everything...
Then we'll see.
Forget it, it's just talk.
You just think about the wedding.
You think so?
-Yes.
What's happening with you?
You've become fashionable.
-Don't like it? -lt's very nice.
Where are the clothes from?
From her?
Who is she? l don't care
if she's divorced, tell me!
Remember the news team
that was here when you arrived?
That beautiful French girl?
You're my sister,
eventually you'll have to know.
Don't make it sound like
a Jordanian soap opera!
ls that French girl Jewish?
Not an lsraeli!
-No, it's not her...
The guy that was with her.
Noam, from Tel Aviv.
What about him?
He's very nice, really.
l don't understand.
What about him?
No, you do understand.
l love him and...
l don't understand
and neither do you!
You're just confused.
Where did you get these ideas?
First she's French,
then a Christian divorcee,
and now it's a guy?
Where does this nonsense
come from?
lt's those American movies
you watch.
Why are you like this?
-Me?
Why are you like this?
Have you gone mad?
This conversation is over.
l have to do my makeup.
We'll talk later.
Please, if you love me,
you must understand me.
No, you understand me!
That's enough.
We'll talk after the wedding.
Surprising choice...
think it will work?
l get goose bumps
when l sing it...
Who was that?
-Golan. l'm not in the mood.
Why are you so mean to him?
He was so sweet at the rave,
l saw everything.
l'm not into him.
-Does he know?
No.
-So tell him.
He'll figure it out.
-Why be an asshole?
Can't you tell him?
He won't cut his wrists.
Men are such stupid animals.
Please, no Judith Butler now.
lt's the semi-finals!
No lectures.
-l can't understand why men,
after all the revolutions,
are still so emotionally crippled.
And you gays are the worst.
Call him now.
Meet him, and tell him.
Now!
OK.
Hey, sweetie.
Just getting ready for
the "Pop ldol" semi-finals.
Never mind.
You feel like having coffee?
No, not at "Orna and Ella",
let's go to Cafe Bialik.
Eight o'clock?
OK. Bye.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
What's happening?
-Everything's according to plan.
Go up to Samira.
She's waiting.
Go to her.
Hello.
-Hi.
How are you?
-Good. And you?
The truth? So so.
Uptight about your sister's wedding?
Yes, a little.
What are you doing these days?
l'm studying here, in college.
You know how it is here,
the level isn't too high.
l want to study architecture abroad.
-Really?
l want to go to London,
l've got relatives there.
London. Not bad.
They've got great music.
They have it all.
Maybe you should come too.
You'll be better off there.
Things will never get better here.
And you'll escape Jihad
and his stupid friends.
l want to go dance a little.
l'll be back later.
OK.
Congratulations, Ashraf.
Dance, dance.
Yes...
Dropped him off in Tel Aviv?
l can't hear.
You're breaking up.
Dropped him off in Tel Aviv?
Great.
Great. May Allah bless you.
l'll wait to hear it on the radio.
Goodbye.
A bomb!
-Are you sure?
And not far away.
l'll see what happened.
Lulu, did you hear?
-Good, it's you.
lt was really big.
The whole house shook.
l thought something would break.
Something broke?
No, nothing, I think.
Where's Yali?
He went out for coffee,
a date with Golan.
Hold on, l have a call.
Noam, that was Golan.
He was late.
The bomb was at Cafe Bialik.
-What?
You're here!
l mean alive. You're alive.
We were worried sick.
We thought the worst.
You are OK, right?
-Yes, our sweet Yali is fine.
Don't get emotional on me.
l don't need drama queens.
l've been declared
"moderately wounded".
lt doesn't even hurt.
l just can't feel my legs.
They say it's the injections.
You'll be fine, l'm sure.
We're Yali's roommates.
l'm Lulu, this is Noam.
Good thing you got here fast.
We were waiting.
We panicked.
When we called the hospital,
the line was busy.
l was scared to come directly here.
My mother called a doctor friend.
That's how we knew.
Hey.
l'm so sorry.
l realized l forgot my wallet.
l had to go back.
That's why l was late.
Just a little late.
l got there a few seconds
after the explosion.
l brought you purple flowers,
your favorite color.
ls that him?
Answer him.
He must be worried.
lt's alright.
l'll talk to him later.
Answer already.
Noam, where are you? Answer me.
That bomb was near your house.
ls everybody OK?
You, not answering,
worries me.
l have to talk to you.
l told my sister.
l "came out", as you guys say.
Call me as soon as you hear this.
No matter what time.
My phone is on.
Bye, "Hubi".
That's "My Love" in Arabic.
Nice of you to fix it
like the cafe.
Don't talk, eat.
Tell me...
-Not with your mouth full.
Seriously. How come you and l
never got together?
What?
You heard me.
What didn't you understand?
lsn't it obvious?
-No.
The moment l met you l knew
you'd be the best guy l'd ever know.
l decided not to ruin it
with a one night stand
or a short affair.
You and me, it's forever.
Soul mates till we die.
Well, l guess
l won't be dying this time.
But good answer,
very good answer.
You always knew how to say
the right thing at the right time.
Good morning.
-Good morning.
A wonderful morning.
-A wonderful morning to the newlyweds.
Thank you.
-l hope you are happy.
l am.
You looked gorgeous last night,
like a bride on TV.
Thanks.
l was so nervous yesterday,
l didn't pay attention to anyone.
l couldn't even sleep.
A bride doesn't sleep
on her wedding night!
You'll have time for sleep later...
Stop! Stop or l'll shoot!
Hold your fire!
Come on, let's get 'em!
Don't be scared, my love.
Don't be scared.
Rana, talk to me!
Wait a moment.
l was going to bring it to you in bed.
You make coffee as well? Nice.
Don't you want coffee?
Never mind, l'm a bit screwed up.
When someone's nice to me,
l think something must be wrong.
Hi, Mom, what's up?
What happened?
There'll be orphans in every house!
ln every street!
Are you sure?
OK Mom, l'll call you later.
Noam!
VioIent rioting has struck NabIus.
The entire city has been put
under curfew.
Disturbances began
at the funeraI of Rana Sirtawi,
daughter to one of the city's
respected famiIies.
She was accidentaIIy kiIIed
during miIitary activity.
OfficiaI sources say it was
during pursuit of terrorists
associated with the bombing
at Cafe BiaIik Iast night...
l can't believe it.
Sirtawi was accidentaIIy caught
in the Iine of fire and hurt.
Hamas officiaIs say they wiII
avenge the kiIIing of Sirtawi,
who recentIy married
a IocaI Hamas Ieader.
Ashraf, answer me.
Call me, please call me.
l'm sorry l couldn't answer before.
Yali was hurt in the bombing.
l was at the hospital.
l wanted to call you sooner.
Now l just saw on TV...
l hope...
Call me.
May you know no more sorrow.
Allah will revenge her.
We'll kill a hundred,
a thousand of them.
They have to be taught a lesson.
So they'll go away from here.
May you know no more sorrow.
Till they all leave.
All the Jews.
Father...
Do you want something to drink?
Something to eat?
My friend, hear me well...
Your daughter is a martyr.
We will avenge her death.
Good thing she didn't see this
before she died.
l won't threaten you.
Don't be scared. Samira is beautiful
and she loves you.
Get married and make your father
happy with a grandchild.
lt's time for me to go.
A bit more.
ls this good?
A little more. That's it.
Can you see Rana?
-Yes.
Begin.
Are you sure you want to carry out
this mission yourself?
Yes. Begin.
l, the living martyr,
Jihad Nasser El-Din,
son of lzz a-Din al-Qassam...
What are you doing here?
l came to take your place.
What do you think he'd like today?
Tomato soup.
Two portions, one for Lulu...
And panacotta. That's his favorite.
Some coffee
while you wait?
A double, thanks.
How is he?
-Alright.
But he doesn't know
he won't walk again.
We're afraid. The doctors say
we can wait to tell him.
That's tough.
Ashraf?
What happened?
l had this weird sensation.
Like an electric shock.
Something's wrong.
Everything's fine, silly.
Panacotta is on the way.
You'll eat to your heart's content.
Sources at the site say a bigger
tragedy was avoided
when the suicide bomber
suddenIy turned around
and bIew himseIf up
in the middIe of the empty street.
Hubi, my love...
Let's fly away.
Maybe beyond the smoke
and the fighting,
there's a better place.
Maybe there really is a paradise
where we can just love each other.
l don't know...
l wonder if we ever really
had a chance?
lf, even for a moment,
we had a chance...
Lulu and Yali will probably give
the papers a photo of the two of us.
Maybe the one from the rave,
where we look all high and happy.
Maybe people will see
how beautiful we look,
and understand how stupid
these wars are.
No, they probably never will.
