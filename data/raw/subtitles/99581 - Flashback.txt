Come in, John.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.
John, does the name Huey Walker
mean anything to you?
Too young to remember.
Huey Walker was a major figure...
in the protest movement of the '60s.
He had a big mouth.
He stirred up a lot of trouble.
Things got too hot,
Walker went underground.
He resurfaced yesterday in the city.
We got an anonymous phone tip and
picked him up on an outstanding warrant.
- What's the charge?
- Something Walker did in 1969...
in Spokane, Washington.
''Malicious mischief
with intent to do bodily harm...
to the vice president
of the United States.''
He tried to kill Spiro Agnew, sir?
No, not exactly.
It's all here in the file.
Sir, do you really think that we can
make this charge stick?
It's been 20 years.
The malicious mischief charge
is bullshit...
but flight from prosecution
carries a sentence of 15 to life.
If you don't mind me asking, why are
we taking such an interest in this?
A hippie radical gets busted.
It seems so routine.
Walker was arrested by FBI agents.
He escaped.
Made the Bureau look pretty foolish.
John, we don't like to look foolish.
No, sir.
Have the son of a bitch in Spokane
by tomorrow morning.
Yes, sir.
Number seven.
Rise and shine, Huey.
This is Special Agent Buckner.
He's taking you to Spokane.
Oh, come back
when you're serious.
This kid doesn't look old enough
to cross the fuckin' street.
Get him down.
Listen, have you guys ever thought
about brightening this place up?
Man, like, you know, it's like
Dracula's castle in there, man.
You know, hey, look.
A few plants, some flowers.
You know, you'd attract
a better class of criminal.
And if I may say one other thing,
the room service sucks...
and so do
some of the customers.
Oh, my God.
I'm ticklish.
That's cold, man.
Hey, that's cold!
You're not gonna need that.
You want to know why,
Mr. Walker?
Because from here to Spokane,
you and I are joined at the hip.
You do what I tell you,
when I tell you.
You don't even take a piss
without me watching.
If you try to escape, I'm authorized
to stop you any way I see fit.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Oh, don't worry, kid.
I ain't gonna give you
no excuse to blow me away.
That's a relief.
Do you want
to watch me piss now?
That's nice.
Over there.
How do you rate so high?
- Did you say something?
- I said, how did you beat out...
all the other junior G-men
for this big honor?
I guess I got lucky.
Yeah.
I thought we were
going to the airport.
Spokane's fogged in.
We're catching the train.
Yeah?
Oh, I like trains.
I know.
I read your report.
You leave on track eight
in ten minutes.
There's a two-hour stopover just
outside Portland in Marsden, Oregon.
- In Marsden?
- Call us when you get there.
- Phil, I know the procedure.
- Local authorities will meet the train.
That way you can park laughing boy
in the local jail, catch some z's.
The final leg of the trip puts you
in Spokane by noon tomorrow.
- Great.
- Okay, well, I guess that's it.
Unless you want to dig up a federal
marshal to go along with you.
Hey, I'd watch out if I were you.
He looks very dangerous.
Yeah, I know.
Come on, get up.
Show's over.
You know, your partner,
pulling his glasses down like that?
Drug use. Urine analysis.
- Surprise him.
- I'll get right on it.
Train number 14, the Pacific Rim,
now boarding at track eight.
FBI.
Thank you.
I'm a federal agent,
and this man is my prisoner.
Soul brother, I am just like you,
a prisoner of the system, man.
Prisoner of the system, man.
Sit down.
Soul brother.
Jesus Christ.
Hey, make yourself
at home, Buckner.
Take your cannon off, man.
Kick back, man, chill out.
- Give me your hands.
- What?
Your hands.
Give me your hands.
Oh, thanks, Buckner.
- Great, man. Thanks.
- No problem.
That is cold, man.
What if the train derails, huh?
What if we plunge
into a river, huh?
You drown.
Know thy enemy.
Fuck, man!
I can't fuckin' take it anymore!
I've had it, man. I ain't been
this fuckin' quiet in my life!
I need women! I need drugs!
I need drink!
I need something, man.
Fuck! This is fuckin' nuts!
I can't get a word in vertical.
Holy shit.
It's been a fuckin' hour
of silence here. Man!
Oh, I've been reading the newspaper
though, however. How about this?
Reagan is writing a book
on his eight years in Washington.
How do you explain his
sudden interest in politics, huh?
That's a cheap shot. He's done
a great deal for this country.
- Well, name one thing.
- He turned the economy around.
Yeah. Now we got two classes:
the truly needy
and the truly greedy.
- Very funny.
- I don't think so.
We got poor people
living in the street, man.
And the rich, they're living
at the Betty Ford Center.
Why don't you go back
and read your paper, okay?
Hey, whatever you say, Warden,
you know?
''Mandatory AIDS testing
for all government employees.''
I guess that means you, Buckner.
I wouldn't worry. You look like
a practitioner of safe sex.
As a matter of fact, you look like
a practitioner of no sex.
Which reminds me,
did you know that condoms...
they got serial numbers on them.
No, I didn't.
That's probably because you never
had to roll 'em down that far.
You missed your calling
in life, Huey.
You should have been
a comedian.
Let me ask you something, man.
When you're not escorting
depraved criminals to justice...
what do you do for fun, man,
you know?
For fun? Well, I don't have
a lot of time for fun.
Besides, what you call fun, I would
probably call irresponsible, so--
How old are you-- 24, 25?
Twenty-six.
Twenty-six
and entered middle age.
Shit, kid, how do you know what
you want until you looked around?
You know, when I was your age--
hell, I was even younger than you--
Is this gonna be a long story?
Hey, I bought
a secondhand Indian.
I rode clear across the country, man.
An Indian, Buckner.
That's a motorcycle.
- I know what an Indian is.
- Yeah?
Hey, America was
really something back then.
That's back before the interstates
came and killed her personality.
You know, sometimes I think
she's still out there sleepin'...
hiding behind those
Pizza Huts and 7-Elevens.
Now, I'm talking about
people and places, Buckner.
I'm talking about
the human highway, man.
- You should write a book.
- Oh, yeah?
- And if I did, would you buy it?
- No. The '60s are over, Huey.
Times have changed.
They've passed you by.
We can't all be flower children
for the rest of our lives, you know.
We don't have to be in such an
all-fired hurry to grow up either.
We could have a little fun first.
Hey, you're young, Buckner.
Yeah, and you're old,
so why don't you do me a favor?
Start acting your age
and leave me alone, okay?
You know what your problem is?
What?
You like me,
but you won't admit it.
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Walker.
When you were riding around
on your Indian...
and wiping your ass with the flag,
my father was in Vietnam.
He fought there.
He died there too.
So don't tell me I like you
'cause I hate your fuckin' guts.
I'm sorry about your dad, Buckner.
The '60s were a weird time, man.
Yeah, I wiped my ass
with the flag.
I did.
It gave me a rash.
- What is that?
- It's my watch.
It's time to take my vitamins.
Does it tell you
when to take a piss too?
- You don't quit, do you?
- Rust never sleeps.
Hey, you know me, huh?
Huey Walker from the '60s.
- Remember?
- Cut it out. Come on.
Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
I haven't been gone that long.
The guy must be a foreigner.
Huey Walker,
a rebel without applause.
Oh, that's good, Buckner.
In fact, it's clever.
You know, you may have
a sense of humor after all.
Thank you.
Hey, don't look now, but I think
that chick is hot for your bod.
Who?
The redhead right over there.
Looks like she was shot in the back
by a pair of cruise missiles.
- Hey, listen, Walker--
- What happened to ''Huey''?
Now let's get this straight.
I'm not your baby-sitter.
I'm not your buddy.
I'm taking you back to jail.
If you don't behave, I gotta drag
you back to the compartment...
and handcuff you to a toilet,
you understand me?
Well, heil Hitler.
Listen, Buckner, since Uncle Sam
is picking up the tab...
you know, why don't we
do this up big, huh?
- Start with a few cocktails.
- I don't drink.
Neither do you.
Think of it as a condemned man's
last request.
Because after tonight,
I'm a convict, I'm a number.
I'm going to a place
that's so exclusive...
you've got to be recommended
by a judge to get in.
I'm about to become a permanent
resident of the Twilight Zone.
Is any of this getting to you,
Buckner?
What do you think?
I think if I was a fly,
you'd pull my wings off.
- That's funny.
- What happened?
When you were a baby, did a hippie
drop you on your head or what?
Good evening, gentlemen.
What can I bring you?
How about a hacksaw?
Only kidding.
I'll have a steak, burn it.
Onion rings, chocolate shake.
Bottle of vodka on the side--
No, just a chocolate shake.
I'm behaving, I'm behaving.
I'll have the grilled fish.
No salt. No oil.
I'd like a mineral water and a plain
green salad with no salad dressing.
- That's it. Thanks.
- Thank you.
I brought my own salad dressing.
I, unlike some people I know,
care about what I put into my body.
I never said a word.
Good.
- Checkmate.
- Damn. That's two in a row.
Three times.
You take way too many risks.
Well, somebody has to.
You don't take any.
Maybe that's why I win.
Did you ever think that maybe I'm
just setting you up for the kill?
You ready for another game?
- What time is it?
- Why? You got a date?
- 9:30.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
It should be kicking in by now.
- What'd you say?
- Oh, I'm just thinking out loud.
You said,
''It should be kicking in by now.''
- Oh, did I?
- What should be kicking in by now?
It's a surprise. It's something
to make the time go faster.
I don't like surprises. I want to
know what you're talking about now.
Well, if you must know--
You know, during dinner...
well, I kind of--
- I went and--
- Went and what?
I went and... slipped some acid in
your mineral water. It's your move.
- What did you say?
- I said, it's your move.
No, before that.
''Acid in my mineral water.''
Oh, yeah. Acid. LSD.
I scored back in the slam, man.
Hey, don't you worry.
I'm not gonna let you trip alone.
I dropped a couple of tabs myself.
Are you okay, man?
Yeah, that's a good one, Huey.
You almost had me going.
Now for my opening gambit,
I am going to destroy you.
Praying will not help.
First--
- What did you do to the board?
- What's the matter?
What'd you do?
We've been playing
for the last half hour...
and your queen's about ready
to bite the big one.
- We haven't even started.
- Bullshit, man.
- Okay, how'd you do that?
- Oh, I get it, uh-huh.
You can't stand to lose, so you're
gonna blame it on the acid.
- There isn't any acid!
- Oh, no?
How come--
Oh, yeah.
How come everything
is starting to look so weird?
You son of a bitch!
- Stop it.
- Go with the flow, Buckner.
Don't end up on a bummer.
I swear, if you slipped something
in my drink, I'm gonna kill you!
- God, what's happening to me.
- You're tripping, man.
It's gonna be great. You're gonna
do shit you never dreamed of.
Don't freak out, Buckner.
You'll wake up to a murder rap.
- No court would convict me.
- Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is an emergency.
Get me a doctor.
- Get me one too.
- FBI! Move it!
God, no!
- Okay, I can beat this.
- Oh, yeah. I'm with you, kid.
We'll ride this out together.
- I'm gonna break your neck.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Okay, so I miscalculated,
all right?
Some people can handle this,
and some people can't.
- I need coffee.
- Oh, no!
That's the worst thing you can take.
You need a downer.
- Like what?
- Like tequila with a beer chaser.
- You better be right.
- Oh, yeah.
Young man's gone
stark raving mad.
- There you go. All right.
- I couldn't find a doctor...
but this young lady says
she's a nurse.
- What's going on here?
- That's for you, my man.
I am Sparkle.
What is problem?
My buddy here,
he took a hit of acid...
- and he's having a bad trip.
- I didn't take it.
This asshole slipped it to me
in my mineral water.
- Are you really a nurse?
- I have magical healing hands.
And one time, I saved man's life
by giving him mouth to mouth.
You pass up this opportunity,
you're a bigger idiot than I--
Shut up.
All I wanna know...
is if drinking this crap is
gonna make me feel better.
In my professional opinion,
go for it.
All right!
You heard the nurse.
Down the hatch, my man.
Buckner, till the worm
comes out your nose.
- Don't do nothing at all
- He is cute, isn't he?
- Yeah.
- Just ask Alice
I think we're here.
- When she's ten feet tall
- Oh, God!
- And you go chasing rabbits
- All right, Buck, baby!
- Bucky, boy!
- In the bunk, Buck!
- To the bunk, boy!
- He's wild boy.
- Animal.
- Oh, my God.
- Sparkle?
- Yeah.
How about you and me
talking a little business, huh?
What you think?
I am hooker?
Who isn't, baby, huh?
Pays the bills.
Besides, I like working train.
Is... educational.
I come to this country,
expand my horizons.
That's great. Listen, how about
expanding my buddy's horizons?
Him? Oh.
Him I almost do for free.
Almost.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
All I want are his clothes.
Okay?
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Sic 'im, Sparkle.
Okay, now! Hey, baby.
Yes, Mr. Buckner.
You are in for a big treat, baby.
Wake up.
You'll have fun with me.
- Hey, Huey.
- I'm sorry.
I'll get out of your way.
You are macho man.
You are macho.
You drive me crazy.
We don't need
no stinking badges, no.
Not to be with Sparkle.
I am crazy about you.
Watch this.
Yeah. Here we go!
You know who you look like?
You look like me.
- Thanks for a great night.
- Anytime, pal.
Come on, Sleeping Beauty.
Time to get you ready for the ball.
Okay, look alive.
Here they come.
- He looks like a drunk.
- Yeah.
Thank you, my good man.
John Buckner, FBI.
Excuse me.
Vitamin time.
- Care for a C?
- No, thanks very much.
- I didn't catch your name, Officer.
- Sheriff Hightower.
Oh, soon to be
Congressman Hightower, I see.
- What happened to this man?
- Actually, he fell down.
I've had a few
fall down on me too.
Well, accidents can happen.
- What's he charged with?
- Army deserter.
- Move him out.
- All right, Dave.
Hey, Studie.
You got a new roommate.
Army deserter.
The train to Spokane is in two hours.
We have a cot back there in a room.
You want to lay down for a while?
- Sheriff, the FBI never sleeps.
- Is that right?
I'm all keyed up.
I want to go out for a walk...
get the smell of that punk
right off my clothes.
That's a good idea. I'm afraid
there's not much to see around here.
It's this way out?
Yeah, just out the door,
down the stairs.
Lucky break.
Look, you're either the cutoff man...
or you're the backup man.
If the ball goes through,
you become the cutoff--
What difference did it make?
The score was 30 to 1, man.
- We surprised them.
- They didn't expect us to score once.
- Those cocky young bastards.
- Oh, they beat us good.
- College boys.
- Barry, they were in their 30s.
Nobody has a bad ass anymore.
- They have machines now, Hal.
- I feel like somebody's grandfather.
See, they've got leg curl machines
and the butt tuck machines.
We didn't have machines.
We smoked pipes and laid on the floor.
By the time they had those machines,
we had no tone left.
Now they've got tone in the womb.
Why did you-- Why did we
want to come here?
- Because we loved this place.
- But this is not working.
It's not the same place anymore.
They put all this post-modern--
I can't stand this disco noise.
I'm gonna go play real music.
They took the peanut shells
off the floor.
Where's the moose head?
Do you remember the moose head?
Wishbones on the antlers.
See, this used to be a bar.
It was a bar.
You go there to drink.
It's not an alcohol boutique.
What'd you put on?
I couldn't figure out
how to work the jukebox.
It's digital.
It's not funny, man.
There is nothing on there
you ever heard of.
- ''Born to be Wild''. Selection 1-1-9.
- It's gone. They're all gone.
- Those soulless bastards.
- That was our anthem, man.
Get your motor running
They wiped the whole decade.
The '60s.
They stole it.
You know what's on there now?
Selection 1-1-9
is something called ''Inks.''
- What does that mean, I-N-X-S?
- What does any of this mean?
Seymour.
Yeah, I know what time it is.
It's freedom time.
It's Huey. It's Huey Walker.
I escaped from the feds.
You told me, if I got myself in the
news, you'd publish my book, babe.
What do you mean,
my arrest--
My arrest made three lines
on the 20th page?
That's practically
the back page.
It is the back page? Shit.
Listen, don't panic.
Wait till they find out
how I escaped from the feds.
What do you mean,
it won't matter?
Listen, man, what do I have to do,
die, before you publish me?
This is my life we're talking about.
That book-- That book's gonna--
Bullshit. I'll show you
that I'm not forgotten.
Hello? Hello?
Goddamn.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel.
You're a beauty.
You're priceless.
Hey, mind if I join you?
I am John Buckner,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- I'm Hal. This is Barry.
- Tell me, John--
Is it John? Tell me, John, what is
the FBI doing here in Marsden?
Are you investigating
terrorist apricot growers?
I am taking a prisoner to trial.
A guy sitting across the street
there in your jail.
Name of... Walker.
Excuse me, did you say--
Did you say Huey Walker?
- Oh, you've heard of him?
- Are you kidding?
- He's here in Marsden?
- He's across the street!
This guy was a maniac.
He was a world-class psycho freak.
Come on, you remember
why he got famous, don't you?
No, I'm a little hazy
on the subject.
He's hazy.
Where were you in the '60s?
On Tau Ceti or something?
I will refresh your memory.
Huey had picked up on the grapevine
that our illustrious vice president...
Spiro T. Agnew...
was making a whistle stop tour
all over the western states.
Oh, Spiro Agnew. They don't make
Americans like that anymore.
John, I like you.
You've got a sense of humor.
- So, Spokane. They're in Spokane.
- Spokane, Washington.
- And there's a big crowd.
- Ten thousand, easy.
And Agnew's out on the back
of the train on a balcony.
And the idea is, see,
he finishes his speech...
and the train
pulls out of the station.
Oh, very dramatic, you know.
Agnew rides off into the sunset
while the multitudes cheer, right?
Except this time,
the train pulls out--
And they leave
Agnew's car behind.
And Agnew is standing there
saying, ''Good-bye, good-bye.''
And the dumbshit's
not going anywhere.
Meanwhile,
the rest of the train...
is halfway to fucking Montana.
He was livid. He just blew it
in front of 10,000 people.
And Huey jumps up and says,
''I did it.
It was me.
I disconnected the train.''
- I tell you, it was--
- Genius.
Pure genius.
So, what is he
under arrest for now?
Oh, disconnecting
Agnew's train car.
They're putting him away
for that now?
- No, come on, no.
- That's right, ace.
This is one American that hopes
they throw away the key.
Now what did he
ever do to you?
What did he do to my country?
I'm a patriot.
Huey Walker, a subversive,
a revolutionary.
His kind took this country down
on its knees during the '60s.
- He's talking about Huey.
- Did I say something wrong?
We loved Huey Walker, man.
Hey, you were kids.
Kids do dumb things.
Look at you now.
You're all grown up.
Now you've joined the system
Wait. Who said anything
about us joining the system?
Sorry, guys. It takes more than
going to your local video store...
and renting Easy Rider
to be a rebel.
- I happen to own Easy Rider.
- Wait a second here.
Mister, you know, maybe we
don't look like revolutionaries...
but it does not
mean that we sold out.
And to prove it, we--
We are going to do
something to help Huey.
- I happen to be a lawyer.
- A real estate lawyer.
- I happen to be a lawyer.
- What, will you do his escrow?
Don't kid yourselves.
You're responsible citizens now.
Don't jeopardize your comfortable
lifestyles for some old hippie.
Get in your BMW,
drive to your homes...
your wives, your children,
your hot tubs...
your wide-screen TVs.
Screw Huey Walker.
Let them flush him
down the toilet of history.
- Who gives a shit?
- We do, John. We do.
And we don't have to sit here...
and be insulted by some fascist.
- You okay?
- I'm all right.
What makes you think
that I'm a fascist?
Come on, come on, Barry.
Let's just get out of here.
Yeah, right, Hal, because this place
is starting to smell like pig.
Forgotten, huh?
Oh, shit.
I'm on the wrong side.
- Don't you fucking talk to me.
- Where's Huey?
Listen to me, asshole.
I spent two years in 'Nam,
and you ain't fit to lick my boots...
you fucking faggot deserter!
Get me the fuck out of here!
Studie, you're not
hurting this boy, are you?
You call yourself a cop?
What did you say?
All right, open it up.
Studie, back off. Studie.
My name is John Buckner.
I'm an F--
''You call yourself a cop.''
Is that what you said to me?
I mean, I didn't hear you.
You're a disgrace.
All right, stand him up.
I'm just going to have to
teach you to respect the law.
Hey, Rand?
FBI's on the phone.
They want to know why their agent
hasn't checked in yet.
Shit. All right,
tell 'em I'm coming.
Okay, just watch my coat,
and don't let him pass out.
Yeah.
Yeah, this is Hightower.
Ah, Agent Prager, good evening.
How are you?
Good. Yes, indeed.
They arrived about an hour ago.
No, I have no idea
why he didn't call you.
He just stepped out
to get some air.
Paperwork?
Yeah, right, yeah, just a minute.
Forty-nine.
Forty--
Oh, God.
- We got him.
- We'll show this storm trooper...
what we're willing to do
for Huey Walker.
Agent Buckner, you see before you
a recalcitrant man.
I deeply apologize for
the misunderstanding back there.
Sheriff, are you in the habit of
violating your prisoners' rights?
They told us you were
an army deserter.
Oh, so if I was an army deserter,
that would've justified your actions?
Let me tell you something.
I'll feel sorry for this state if you
were ever elected to Congress.
Look!
There's nothing I can do.
All I can do is apologize to you
and hope that you accept it.
You have more to worry about than
a bloody nose and some dented pride.
- I beg your pardon?
- Well...
You lost your prisoner.
I did not.
You'll need my help to get him back.
So, how does this sound?
You work with me. I mean,
forget the cell and all that...
and I'll work with you.
My only concern right now...
is to get Huey Walker
back in custody.
After that is done...
we will then deal with
what took place in your cell.
So, where do we start?
I think we should start
by cleaning your face.
You're a bit of a mess.
Look, I'll put out an alert.
The bathroom is right down there,
out the door to the right.
If you need anything, a towel,
just ask one of the deputies.
Thank you.
Well, what do you think, Rand?
I think that little shit's
gonna hang me out to dry.
Yeah? Barney, what is it?
Yeah, get Buckner
back in here right now.
What? Who? Yeah.
Yeah, put him on.
Yeah, this is Sheriff Hightower.
What's on your mind?
Oh, what?
- What is it?
- Would you hold on, please?
I have someone here who calls
themselves the '60s Liberation Army.
- What?
- And they claim to be holding...
FBI agent John Buckner hostage.
- They want to trade him for Walker.
- Trade him? Give me the phone.
See if you can tape this.
Hello.
Calm down.
Calm down there.
No. Absolutely, we need
to make the exchange.
No, John Buckner is one of
our most important agents.
Absolutely.
- I know the bridge. Adams Road.
- How do you know that?
You have my word.
I can't wait to get my hands
on that son of a bitch.
Yes! Yes!
Let's go to work.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Disguise your voice.
- Why?
So he doesn't
recognize us from the bar.
Good!
Watch your head.
- Shit, that hurt.
- Sorry.
We're gonna exchange you
for Huey Walker.
I can't believe this.
I've been abducted by
the Vienna Boys Choir.
Uh-uh. We are desperate men.
Well, you sound more like
desperate women.
Don't push it, buddy.
Look, I'm gonna save you guys
a lot of trouble, all right?
You don't have to exchange me
for Huey Walker. I am Huey Walker.
I shaved my beard,
I cut my hair...
so I'd look a little more
like an FBI agent, right?
Hey, if you don't believe me,
check my wallet.
It belongs to the real agent,
all right?
But you don't have a wallet.
- Well, then you lost it.
- No, no, no. Nice try.
- This is all there was.
- Don't play with that.
Screw the wallet. Why would I make up
that story if I'm not Huey Walker?
- They really train these guys well.
- Very well.
I am Huey Walker, you assholes!
And you are about
to hand me over to the enemy!
- It's time. I'm gonna get the car.
- You get the car.
All right, hold it.
I lied, all right?
I am an FBI agent, and you two guys
are gonna be doing the hot squats...
if you don't release me--
I'm gonna need a gun
and some handcuffs.
Well, here. Take mine.
Better keep drinking. If we sober up,
we'll never go through with this.
Hal, how do I keep drinking
when there's nothing in the bottle?
- Hal? You called me Hal!
- What?
Now he knows my name, Barry!
This is Hightower. Everybody hold
your position until I give the signal.
Well, I will say one thing:
they're punctual.
All right, get ready.
Okay, we're here.
We're here. It's us.
All right, you start your man
walking, and I'll start mine.
All right, let's go.
Get back here, bastard,
or I'll blow your nuts off!
I'm walking. I'm walking.
I'm walking now. I'm walking.
Okay, I'm walking.
Oh, I'm walking now.
That doesn't look like
Huey Walker.
Does look a little young.
Barry, I want to go home now.
Hey, hey! Wait a minute!
Hold it!
- Merry Christmas.
- You look good yourself, Buckner.
- I'd watch it. I have a gun.
- And I came unarmed.
Look, you wait here.
I'll go and find one.
If I'm not back in an hour,
start without me.
- That's funny.
- Thank you.
Why don't you shut up
and assume the position.
Which one did you have in mind?
I'm just tired enough to shoot you
for the hell of it. Move.
You think you're tired? You have
no idea the night that I'm having.
I got kidnapped by the Abbott and
Costello of the ''me'' generation.
- Sounds really rough.
- Hey, way to go, Buckner.
Hell of a job. I think we should get
the Ghost of Christmas Past here...
back to town, and then
I'm gonna call the media.
Come on. You wouldn't begrudge me
a little free publicity, would you?
A capture like this could
put my election in the bag.
We're not going back to town.
Three of us are driving to Spokane.
I'm gonna put him away,
then I'll bring you up on charges.
I don't know what it was,
but I had a feeling about you.
It was an instinct.
That's why I gave you a gun
with an empty clip in it.
Go ahead. Try it. You wanna
check it, pull the trigger.
Yeah. Come on. See, I might
have to bring you up on charges.
That is, if you don't get yourself
killed between here and town.
- Oh, smooth move, Buckner.
- Shut the fuck up.
Now we're all gonna walk
very slowly back to the car.
Can you swim?
- Not like this. No way.
- You better learn.
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
- Motherfuckin' goddamn--
- Do you see 'em?
What the--
Now every-- Jesus!
Where were all these guys
when I needed them?
There's 12 fucking guns here,
and nobody's shooting!
Half of you men cover this bank
and the rest come with me.
Walker and Buckner
are working together.
So if you see them,
shoot to kill. You hear me?
- Shoot to kill!
- Let's go.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- I can't believe this.
- Me either. I could've drowned.
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about Hightower.
- He tried to kill us.
- Oh, no shit, Sherlock.
I mean, you threatened
to cut his balls off.
What do you expect him to do,
hand you the knife?
He's a law officer.
He was gonna commit murder.
I'm telling you, with a guy like
Hightower, you got to cut a deal...
and then you come
to an understanding...
and then you screw him.
And you don't just say, hey,
I'm gonna file charges against you.
Not unless you've got a major
fucking death wish. Oh, God.
If I find a phone, contact my people,
I can get us out of this mess.
Get real, man! Where are you
gonna find a phone, huh?
I'll find one. Get up!
If it hadn't been for you, Buckner,
I'd be in a warm cell right now.
Yeah, being beaten by
a nice warm rubber hose.
Anything would be better than this.
Oh, my God!
Could we just stop, man,
and light a fire, huh? God!
How?
Who do I look like,
Grizzly Adams to you?
I don't know jack shit about
wilderness survival, man.
All I know is I got no feeling
in my toes, all right?
And my dick has
turned into an icicle.
Oh, and the sooner I escape
from you, the better, man.
- Oh, God.
- Let me tell you something.
The first time you escaped
from me was sheer luck.
- It won't happen again.
- Sheer luck? That's what you think?
Well, let me tell you something.
Luck never entered the picture.
Do you know something? Who do
you think made the phone call...
that got me busted
in the first place?
It was an anonymous phone call.
You know that.
Oh, yeah, but I made that
phone call. I got myself busted.
Oh, yeah?
Why would you do that?
Because I had escaped
the first time, 20 years before.
I didn't see any reason
why I couldn't do it again.
And if I hadn't have run into
those two dingdongs in that bar--
Give me a break. This is just
some more of your bullshit.
Nobody would get themselves
captured so they could escape again.
Oh, yeah, he might...
if he wanted to drum up
publicity for his book.
What book? What book?
The one I've been working on
for the past 20 years.
It's sort of an autobiography.
Hey, wait. Are you telling me
you went out and ruined my life...
so you could get
your stupid book published?
That stupid book is all I have
to show for the last 20 years.
- I've lived like a hunted animal.
- They flushed my head down a toilet.
Oh, yeah, well,
blame me for everything.
I can't believe you.
So now you'll probably tell me...
that you didn't put any acid in my
mineral water or any of that stuff.
As a matter of fact, I didn't.
There never was any acid.
- I wouldn't slip acid to an enemy.
- You're a liar.
The things you did,
you had trapped inside you.
I just provided you with
an excuse to let them out.
Okay, explain to me one thing.
What about my watch,
the chess pieces?
Oh, that was so easy.
It's like--
It was simple misdirection
and sleight of hand.
Let me give you an example,
all right?
You see this?
I got you, Buckner!
I got you this time!
- How the--
- How? I spent a couple summers...
traveling with a Mexican carnival.
You can't hang around the carny
without picking up a few tricks.
- I'll see you later, amigo.
- Get me out of this.
Buckner, word of honor.
If I ever find civilization...
I will send back
a rescue party for you, dude.
- Adios, amigo.
- Walker!
Bon voyage!
You need me to survive!
You'll never get out of here alive!
I grew up here!
Well, if it isn't
Trailblazer Huey.
Did you say something about
growing up around here?
Yeah, I did.
What you gonna do about it?
Well, you know,
I'm no monster.
I just can't let a guy
freeze to death out here.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you this key, all right...
if you promise to lead me
down the mountain.
- What's the catch?
- Well, since I'm saving your life...
when we reach the bottom,
you let me go free.
- No deal.
- Goddamn it, Buckner!
I'm calling the shots here!
I walk away from this,
you're a dead man.
If you walk away from me,
you're a dead man.
You'll never make it out there
by yourself.
Go on, leave. Go.
What you waiting for?
- I don't see your feet nailed down.
- You'd rather die than make a deal.
- That's right.
- Then die, man. What do I care?
All right!
- Okay, put these on.
- No, we'll just call it a draw.
We'll just call it a draw.
Don't try to put those on me...
- or I'll split your head open.
- You ain't got the guts.
Just try me.
Yeah, you're probably right.
You'd just throw your back out...
and I'd have to carry you down
the goddamn mountain.
Yeah? Well, get going.
I wouldn't stand there too long.
You're standing in poison sumac.
Nice try, Buckner.
Just start walking, all right?
You didn't expect me
to fall for that old gag, did you?
Oh, no.
You're way too smart for me.
Yeah. Even if it was poison sumac,
which it wasn't...
- nobody ever died from that.
- No.
- They just wished they were dead.
- Keep walking.
I just had a little itch, that's all.
It's gone now.
It's gonna get worse.
Goddamn it, Buckner!
Why didn't you tell me that
I was standing in poison sumac?
I did. And you better do something
about it, or it'll go out of control.
Oh, you gonna tell me there's
a drugstore around here somewhere?
No, but I know a natural cure.
Well, I don't need a natural cure,
okay? I'm fine.
It's just a matter of mind control.
- Keep walking.
- Okay.
Okay, are you gonna
tell me or what?
Tell you what?
About your goddamn
natural cure.
Nah, you wouldn't believe me.
Tell me.
- It's mud.
- Mud?
Fresh creek mud.
You are right.
I don't believe you.
Fresh creek mud?
How dumb do you think I am?
This better work.
- Okay, get down on one knee.
- Yeah?
Put your hand over your heart.
Put the other hand in the air...
and sing ''Mammy''.
I can't believe you fell for it!
You're such a jerk!
You tricked me!
How's it feel?
Let's go.
Open the door
for these gentlemen.
Thank you.
Mr. Stark, welcome to Marsden.
I'm Sheriff Hightower.
- How was the trip?
- Where's Buckner?
Well, I'm afraid I have
a little bad news.
- Something happen to him?
- Yes, well, you might say that.
A few hours ago, he helped Huey Walker
escape into the mountains.
- What?
- He said he helped Huey Walker--
I heard what he said, Prager.
I just don't believe it.
Yeah, well, it's hard to believe,
but it happens to be the truth.
What can I say?
All right.
Okay. That's it.
I'm not walkin' another step.
Keep going.
We're almost there.
You keep saying that.
Oh, God. Feel that.
Does that feel good?
I never thought I'd ever see
the damn sun again.
Is that beautiful? Wow, man.
Keep moving, Huey.
We're almost home.
Home?
- You grew up here?
- Yup.
But this is an old
hippie commune, man.
My parents and their friends
built this place back in '60s.
Wait a minute. Didn't you tell me
that your father died?
- I lied.
- You lied?
I lied.
My dad made this.
He was a college dropout.
He used to wear love beads
and granny glasses.
He used to grow pot
up on the back hill.
My mother?
She used to bake bread...
spun silk from a wooden loom.
In the evenings, when the family would
get together around that bonfire...
we used to sing songs.
All kinds of songs.
I don't know.
I guess, like a lot of kids, I...
just wanted to be the opposite
of what my parents stood for.
I ran away, changed my name,
created the past that I wanted.
I fabricated a middle-class
upbringing that even I believed.
Wow.
I thought I was a rebel.
I should've taken lessons from you.
Yeah.
You said you changed your name?
Free!
Free?
Maggie?
- Is that really you?
- It's really me.
Gee, I'm doing all the work here.
How about hugging back?
Free. You son of a bitch.
You know, you've got
your father's eyes--
strong and clear,
good and kind.
I'm glad to see you,
and I'm mad as hell at you!
You never even wrote me,
not one letter.
I didn't think anybody was here.
I heard everybody left.
You know me.
I'm too stubborn to let go.
I'll get back to you later.
Introduce me to your friend here.
- He's not my friend. He's--
- Huey Walker.
- You know me?
- Know you?
You think I spent the '60s in a coma?
Of course I know you.
You're a hero
to the people that lived here.
I guess you neglected
to mention that, Free.
Don't call me Free.
I would be thrilled
to shake your hand, Mr. Huey Walker.
Hey, why is he wearing these?
Why don't you tell her, Free?
- I told you not to call me that.
- Okay. I'll tell her.
You know how some kids, they run
away from home, they join the circus?
Well, this little piggy ran all the way
to Washington, DC...
and he joined the FBI.
That's a joke, right?
I always knew that you would
turn out bad, but not this bad.
The FBI, huh?
I guess that's better than the Klan
or the CIA, right?
I didn't come here to justify myself.
I need to borrow your phone.
I have to make arrangements to get this
guy picked up and taken back to Spokane.
There's a sheriff out there who'd like
to see both of us in a shallow grave.
Please.
By all means, let's run inside
before we freeze our balls off.
- Move.
- Hey.
Please come in
and make yourselves at home.
I'm gonna slip into something
a little less comfortable.
Well, don't do it
on my account.
Where's the goddamn phone?
Don't worry about it.
Warm up.
God, this feels better
than sex, man.
So, Huey, what'd
they arrest you for?
Creative railroading.
- You mean Agnew's train?
- Yeah, that's right.
You're kidding me?
After all this time...
they're gonna put you away
for that immature stunt?
''Immature stunt''?
That was my moment
of transcendent glory.
That was my ultimate act of...
civil disobedience.
Sorry.
I thought it was dumb.
How can you say that? That's
the one thing I'm remembered for.
God, I hope you don't
really think that.
I hope you know you're remembered
for the things you said.
All I ever did was pull some stunts
against the establishment...
and say some crazy stuff
that kept my name in the news.
- That's all.
- You are so wrong.
You had a special gift.
You set our minds on fire.
- Free heard you.
- Yeah.
You made us understand that
if we really cared individually...
each of us could
make a difference.
But collectively,
we could change the world.
I remember when you spoke.
You made me feel like you were
speaking directly to me.
Is that true?
I could listen to this all day.
Look, I hate to break up
your love affair here.
Maggie, you're all wrong.
He's an escaped felon.
He's not a hero.
And he's going back to jail.
Would you please tell me
where your phone is?
The only thing you should be doing
with a phone, doll, is calling your parents.
- When's the last time you spoke to them?
- I don't remember.
You probably don't even
know where they are, right?
Carmel.
I am an FBI agent.
Monterey.
Not a very good one.
They moved there last summer
to open up a health food store.
Come on in, boys.
- Move.
- I'm coming with you.
He hurts me
when I'm alone with him.
Wow!
I don't know whether I've died and
gone to hippie heaven or hippie hell.
Cool, man.
Hey, Free, remember
the old road hog?
We drove that thing
from here to Woodstock.
- You went to Woodstock?
- I was five years old.
- I never got to Woodstock.
- Heads up, Free!
It's my Frisbee.
Hey, Huey.
Uh-huh. Abbie, Janis...
Hendrix, Lenny...
Che, Morrison...
Malcolm-- What do you gotta do,
die to be on this wall?
Not exactly.
Was I ever that young?
I painted that back in 1969.
Like I said,
you were always my hero.
I recognize the flag.
Maggie, the phone please.
Look, Free, this guy
changed your parents' life.
If they knew what you were
trying to do to him, they--
They'd be ashamed. Great.
That's the exact same way
I feel about them. So, please.
Your parents
are wonderful people.
My parents
were an embarrassment.
They love you, Free.
You don't know what
you're talking about, okay?
Do you remember when that lady
came here from the school board...
and told me
I had to attend public school?
Did you guys ever think
what it might be like...
for a hippie kid
in a world of normal kids?
They laughed at me--
my clothes, the way I talked.
I wanted to drink Cokes,
not carrot juice.
I wanted to eat burgers,
not alfalfa sprouts.
I wanted to watch TV.
I wanted to play football--
wear shoulder pads
and tackle other kids.
Maggie, I didn't wanna be different.
I wanted to be the same.
So you ran away, you joined the FBI,
and now you're a happy guy.
I'm a lot happier now than I was
when I was here, yeah.
Funny. You look kind of
miserable to me.
Got something to show you, Free.
- I don't have time. I need a phone.
- Make time.
You ought to do
what she says, Free.
We're checking every farm, cabin,
barn and structure in the area.
If you want my opinion, I think
they froze in those woods...
like a couple of Popsicles.
I doubt it. Huey Walker's got
the survival instincts of a cockroach.
If they do survive,
what happens to Buckner?
I mean, aiding a felon,
that's a pretty serious offense.
First of all, I don't know
if he is helping Walker.
All I've got
is your word for that.
I'm waiting to hear
Buckner's side of the story.
Sure. Absolutely. I mean,
I wouldn't mind hearing it myself.
Is this Buckner's parents? Free?
Free's parents--
Jacqueline and Harry.
That's Buck-- Free?
He looks like an angel.
He was an angel.
- God, you look great.
- Thanks.
- What year is this?
- 1967.
That's the summer of love.
What do you think
he's wishing for, huh?
What do you suppose
he's wishing for?
I don't know.
I hope he gets it.
Oh, man.
It seems so long ago,
doesn't it?
It was so long ago.
That's it.
The phone is in the toolshed.
You're here all alone, huh?
Yeah, the past six months.
Just me and George.
- George.
- The owl.
- Lives in the chicken barn.
- Uh-huh.
I saw that foreclosure notice.
Yeah. I'm telling you, lately...
this place just gets harder
and harder for me to handle.
I think maybe
I just got a little tired.
I made it work for a while
though. I did.
I made it thrive.
That time's sort of over now,
I think.
But that's okay...
'cause now I really believe that
everything happens for a reason.
Like you being here.
How do you mean that?
How do I mean that?
I mean I used to have
this fantasy...
about certain people coming here.
Awfully nice that you
finally made it. I'm glad.
Yeah. Me too.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I'll let you in
on a little secret though.
Lately, I've been dreamin' about
microwave ovens...
and automatic food processors.
Think that means
that I sold out?
Okay, Huey, get up.
That's Moon Man's old gun.
Where'd you find that?
Do it.
Put your hands over your head.
- You could've killed me.
- That's right.
Holy shit! I can't believe
it's working.
You know something, Buckner?
When you change, man,
you really change.
Thank you.
Come on. Keep goin'.
Go, folks.
Let's move it. Let's go.
Huey, are you all right?
Wow, man! I haven't had
a rush like that...
since the Berkeley riots.
Wow!
Where did you get
your driver's license?
What license?
Who needs drugs, huh?
Wow.
Hey, Dale, would you get
that kid outta here.
The Coast Daylight now arriving.
If you don't mind my telling you,
I think this is a waste of time.
They'd never be stupid enough
to come here.
Yes, we know how you
feel about it, Sheriff.
- Well, good.
- But we've done everything else we can...
so we'll continue the roadblocks,
the helicopter surveillance...
and check everyone
who gets on this train.
Come on, Dad.
I really need that mitt.
Don't yell at me.
Talk to your mother.
- I saved up enough money.
- Don't talk to me about this.
You have $20.
That's $35.
- It's a hippie van.
- Daddy, what is this?
When I was a kid, we used to use this bus
to smuggle draft dodgers into Canada.
Come on.
They'd take the train
across the border...
and bail out at a spot
called Dodgers' Leap.
- Dodgers' Leap?
- That was the safest place to jump.
Down the hatch.
Guess this is good-bye.
If you ever get back this way--
Come on.
- All right.
- Take care of each other.
Wow! What a crowd.
Talk about your vast multitudes.
Be honest now. Show of hands.
How many of you came to see me?
Okay. Now, how many of you
came here for free sex?
That's what I thought.
Well, guess what.
You're having free sex right now.
That's right.
I say you're being screwed right now
and you don't even know it.
I'm talkin'about this war we're in.
I'm talkin'about the bozos who sit in
the driver's seat of our government.
They're givin'it to you good.
And all of you, know what?
They're not even gonna call you
in the morning and say thanks.
I wanna say something
about this war.
I always liked this speech.
Relive your glory days later.
We got a train to catch.
Slip out there.
But how do we get out?
Turn the boats around.
We've now dropped more bombs,
by tonnage, on Vietnam...
than on Germany and Japan together
in all of World War II.
- Get back. Get back.
- Enough to kill everyone in Vietnam...
28 times.
Unfortunately, most of us
can only die once.
Come on, you guys.
What's goin' on?
- You gettin' tough?
- Barry, help.
Come on, you guys.
... another revolution.
- Break it up, you guys.
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks for breakin' it up.
- This guy's a hothead sometimes.
I'm sorry. It was my fault.
It's him!
It's Huey!
All right! Sheriff's deputies!
Everybody, FBI!
- Feds?
- FBI! People, move!
All right, Huey! Let Buckner go
and come out with your hands up!
Oh, my.
Check it out.
Is something going on, Officers?
That's not a real gun, is it?
It's empty, sir. There's a very large
hole in the floor.
That is so true, and I have been meaning
to have that fixed for so long...
but you know how things are.
You can't just run into town
any old time you want.
I mean, when was the last time--
Who in the hell's that woman
anyway?
Hey. Hey, what's happening?
I think Buckner and Walker
are on the train. Can we stop it?
- No, no. It's too late now.
- What's the next station?
It's across the border into Canada.
Call the Canadian authorities
and tell them to meet us there.
Oh, shit.
- We spent 171 billion in Vietnam.
- Good luck, boys.
We could've bought every Vietnamese
a house cheaper than that.
It's a crazy time. You must not
ratify your government's madness.
They talk of patriotism,
but it's a song of death.
If you're a girl, no one
will be here to love you.
If you're a parent, you'll never
see the harvest-- the grandchildren.
But those who have
the most at stake...
are the young and the strong
and the hopeful-- the boys.
Only our best qualify to die.
It's not dangerous
to be old and frail.
The young have
the most to lose.
And they're betting you don't care.
I'm betting you do.
You can make a difference.
You can make a choice.
In that sense, you're the most
important generation sinceJefferson.
And what do you get if you win?
The only thing I can promise you
is a clear conscience.
Well, some of us have to be
in court in the morning.
- So I'll see you later.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Is it over?
Yeah, it's over.
You know somethin'?
I don't need you to hold my hand
all the way to Canada.
I'm quite capable of gettin'
across the border on my own.
I wouldn't bet on it.
Anyways, I hear Canada's supposed
to be real nice this time of year.
Don't get any ideas.
I don't need a traveling companion.
Why not? What else
have I got to go back to?
How about a life?
It's not like I can be John Buckner,
FBI agent.
Maybe I'll go on the road,
find myself.
Hey, come here.
Fuck the road, all right?
You think it's a romantic
adventure being a fugitive?
It sucks.
Hey, it's shitty jobs, man.
It's livin' in rat holes.
It's not being able to have
a decent relationship...
with another human being
because you got to be able...
to pick up and split
at any given moment.
The road sucks, Buckner.
Hey, man, take it from me.
I've been doin' it
for 20 fuckin' years, man!
It's my choice to make.
Huey, what are you doing?
We're almost there.
Look!
Okay, I didn't wanna
have to do this. Come on.
Huey, what are you doing?
Don't anybody
try to stop me!
I'll snuff the FBI agent.
He's my hostage.
You understand?
He's my ticket outta here.
Well, struggle, damn it.
Wow! Look at that gun.
I don't believe in struggling, Huey.
Passive resistance.
Cut this out.
Put up a fight,
or I'll blow your brains out.
He doesn't mean that. Really.
I'm trying to clear your name,
you dumb asshole.
You ever think that
I might not want it cleared?
You wanna go to jail for aiding
and abetting a fugitive?
No, I don't wanna go to jail.
I wanna go with you.
The hell you are!
Aw, come on.
Take the kid along.
Who asked you?
Come on, Huey,
where's your sense of humor?
I lost it when you decided
to tag along, all right?
Then I'll cheer you up
with my latest idea.
Why do we have to jump
at Dodgers' Leap...
when you know how
to uncouple the last car?
I'm surprised you didn't think of it
yourself. Think of the headlines.
''Twenty years later,
Huey Walker does it again.''
Get your book published.
Buckner, shut up
and listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you something now
I've never told another living soul.
Once I've told you,
you're gonna go away from me...
and you're gonna
leave me alone.
I never disconnected
Agnew's train car, all right?
- What?
- No. Some drunken railroad man.
He did it by mistake.
A rumor started that I'd done it,
so I copped to it, man, you know?
Some of the feds knew the truth, but
since I was willing to take the credit...
they decided
to burn me for it.
Now, my only way out
was to tell them I didn't do it.
By then, hey, it reached
legendary proportions, man.
You gotta understand something,
that up until this time...
I'd always thought of myself
as a chickenshit...
just hiding behind my mouth
and my jokes.
Let me get this straight. You're willing
to go to jail for something you didn't do.
No, I am not willing to go to jail
for something that I didn't do.
Wait a second.
I don't get it.
People thought I was a hero,
a man of action.
I dug that even if it meant being
on the run for the rest of my life.
Hell, I was a kid. I thought
the rest of my life was two days.
I didn't know
that it meant forever.
- So you're a fake.
- Yeah.
- Just like me.
- What?
Get down!
Give me the gun.
Hightower, what are you, crazy?
You'll never get away with this.
Me killing two dangerous criminals?
Hell, that'd make me a hero.
Goddamn it! If it wasn't for you,
I'd be long gone.
There's a door. Use it.
Get serious. He'd blow me apart
before I even get halfway there.
I am serious. You can't wait
for Dodgers' Leap.
They'll hear the shots
and come running.
Hurry up, and I'll cover you.
You'd do that for me?
You're running out of time!
Move it!
- I'm not asking you to do this.
- I keep hearing you say that.
If you're trying to make me
feel guilty, man--
You don't go now,
I'll shoot you myself.
- One!
- You sure are makin' this easy on me.
Two! Three!
Throw out your gun!
You're only making it
harder on yourself.
You know, I think you're right.
I do.
I swear to God I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.
I don't even know
why I'm doing it.
Look, all right. Okay.
Look, I'm gonna, um--
I'm gonna come out now,
but you don't shoot me, okay?
Throw out the gun.
Okay, I'm gonna--
I'm throwin' out the gun.
Right now.
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- Okay, okay. Anything you say.
Now!
Where'd that get you, in the knee?
Here's the shoulder.
You had to push me.
See, I don't understand.
Well, see--
Now it's me that's
gonna be doin' the pushing.
Look at me.
You awake? Look at me.
Don't ever fuck
with a winner, John.
That's my advice to you.
How about a little fresh air?
To me, you look like
you could use some.
Huh? What do you think?
I don't know what happened,
Mr. Stark.
By the time I got there...
Walker had shot him
and thrown his body off the train.
Had I been there a minute earlier,
I could've saved that boy.
That's something that's gonna
live with me for the rest of my life.
Goddamn it, I'll never forget it.
You're going off, boy.
Duck!
What are you grinnin' at?
- Huh?
- You. You came back.
Well, don't get it wrong.
I had no choice.
I got out there and there was
no safe place to jump, man.
Anybody ever tell you...
you make a lousy liar?
Well, if you think I came back
to help you, that's a good one.
You know what
your problem is?
What?
You like me,
but you won't admit it.
You may be right, pal.
Nothing to worry about. FBI.
FBI. Everything's under control.
FBI. Everything's
gonna be all right.
- Buckner, point that at me.
- Why would I wanna do that?
- Just do it!
- Put your hands down.
- Put your hands down.
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Damn you, Buckner. You had this
planned from the beginning...
didn't you,
you clever bastard?
We'll take it from here, John.
- Chief, Huey didn't do it.
- Don't try to talk. Save your strength.
- Spread 'em.
- For God's sake, get him a doctor!
Buckner was too much for me--
dogged, relentless.
I shoot him,
and he still comes after me.
This boy deserves a medal
or at least a raise.
He's clean, sir.
Hands behind your back.
Come on, Walker.
Hold still, damn it!
You son of a bitch!
I would love to stay and shoot the shit
with you about the old days, Stark...
but this is where I get off.
Go. Go.
Prager, where's the key?
Walker, open this door!
Go, Huey.
Open this door!
- You metal motherfucker!
- Don't you do that!
You want a fight,
you got it!
- Don't you do that!
- What the hell is he doing?
No hunk of steel is gonna stand
between me and my freedom.
Come on! Come on!
Turn it loose!
Come on. Give up!
I did it.
I did it!
I did it!
I did it this time, man!
I did it!
I really did it!
Hey, yeah! Give it your best shot.
Go on, shoot me!
Who are you kidding?
You can't hit me.
Not in the back
of a moving train.
I actually got him.
You idiot.
Now get the hell outta here.
Get a doctor for Buckner.
Somebody turned this in.
I helped him escape.
As far as I'm concerned...
you were his hostage.
That's all anybody has to know.
He really got to you,
didn't he?
Yeah.
He got to me too...
20 years ago.
I told you he escaped
from the FBI.
Actually, he escaped from me.
- You?
- I'm sorry, John.
I thought you, of all people,
would be impervious to him.
There was something
about the guy.
The way it looks, Hightower's gonna
be in prison for a long time.
Well, since I can't change your mind,
good luck, John.
Let's think of this
as a leave of absence.
Your job will be here
if you want it back.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
Take it easy, Prager.
Enjoy it, son.
Want me to sign that for you?
I hear that an author's signature
can double the value of the book...
especially if he's dead.
Some FBI agent you are. I've been tailing
you ever since you left the office.
I watched you die.
Get real, Buckner.
You cannot hit a man
from the back of a moving train.
You know when it came to me?
Out there on the flatcar,
it finally came to me.
I said to myself,
you know something...
you're never gonna be free, you're
never gonna get your book published...
unless people think
that you're dead.
So I made myself dead.
What's the matter, kid?
You didn't really think
I was dead, did you?
You son of a bitch.
Of course I did.
- Hey! I cried for you.
- Hey, man.
Listen, I am deeply moved.
The clothes are new
and bought and paid for.
Fuck with the limo.
It's a rental, all right?
You tricked me again.
I wanted to come back
and say thanks.
Probably came to see
how your book was doin'.
- Well, that too.
- How's it doin'?
The publisher was right.
I had to die to get a best-seller.
Now that you're a capitalist, what are
you doing with your newfound wealth?
You know, I was thinking about
investing in some property...
in upstate Oregon.
It's an old hippie commune.
Maybe I can convince the woman
who lives there to stay there...
by tempting her
with a microwave.
Rebellion is a young man's game.
I'll do my best.
Well, we're counting on you.
We're gonna need you.
Because when we get
out of the '80s...
the '90s are gonna make the '60s
look like the '50s.
I'll keep that in mind.
Couldn't find an Indian, huh?
No. I figure it'll get me
down the coast though.
Say hello to your parents
for me, will you?
- Yeah, I will.
- All right.
Okay, bud. You keep
the wind at your back.
You know?
Hey, kid, let's
rock and roll here, huh?
I don't remember your name.
What's your name?
Loomis, sir.
You look like you need
to loosen up, Loomis.
- Whatever you say, sir.
- Knock off that ''sir'' shit, all right?
You look like you got
a stick up your ass.
Relax. Climb in the back.
I'll do the driving.
I'd do what he says, Loomis.
The younger generation, huh?
I tell ya.
- Hey, Huey.
- Yeah.
Don't grow up, huh?
Hell, kid, I'm too old
to grow up.
Once we get out of the '80s...
the '90s are gonna make the '60s
look like the '50s.
Wow, man!
I haven't had a rush like that
since the Berkeley riots!
