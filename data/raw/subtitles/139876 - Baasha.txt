cured. I told you to arrange

You needn't go anywhere!
Here it is! Here doctor! Brother! This

I've passed in 1st class brother.
I'll get more than 95./... You'll get me
medical seat as you said, won't you?
What? Medical college? No need of all
those! What you studies is enough!
Learn works in our house and try to get
good name from your husband's house!
Mother! You don't worry dear! I told
that I'd make you a doctor, didn't I?
You're becoming doctor definitely. God's is
there!
You're brother!
Yuvarani! You've passed! What happened to
your sister Queen? She? Zero
Bride Bride Come! Come Keep your
right leg and come!
Mother! See mother! They are making fun of
me! I was vexed as I failed!
Have you vexed! We're vexed thinking of
you! Correct!
You're the only person in the world who has
failed in 1st standard 3 times!
If it is like this in the 1st standard
itself, should we ask in this class.
Brother! She is not fit to study. See
a good person and send her with him.
You've said correctly. Why didn't you tell
this before!
As the whole your birth itself is waste!
You
Good children Wash your hands and legs
and come in! We'll take Tiff in.
Father! The time has come to light three
lamps by making Shiva inspector,
Geetha doctor and by making Kavitha to
get married with a person from
good family as you wished! You'd be with
me always to finish everything well.
She is telling doctor,
that and this on herself.
You're supporting her in this!
Is becoming doctor an ordinary thing? Do
you know how much we'd spend?
Geetha should become a doctor! That is all!
I'm saving money for that!
Why are you worrying about that mother?
If somebody is there in your place, they'd
not have done for other's children.
Your mother is not lucky to see you.
That good lady had passed away in your
childhood itself!
You're there in that place mother!
Let it be!
When are you going to think about you?
Don't you need a life for you?
Let these children light these three lamps!
That God will light my life lamp.
I'll make a move mother!
Manikkam! Are you going to duty? Yes!
There is great problem near Saidapet!
Is it so? You don't like fights, do you?
Don't go that side! Careful. I won't go!
Brother! Come this side! Our auto is like
glass bungalow! Yes brother!
If we hit others, our
auto will get damaged.
Even if others hit us
our auto only will get damaged! Go
carefully!
I've fixed marriage for our sister Mari.
Somehow I've arranged everything.
I came to get 1000 rupees as credit.
I'll pay it back brother!
See Dhamu! Both getting and
giving credit is wrong!
There won't be respect!
We should manage with what we can. Here!
I won't give credit!
Hundred rupee is there! Keep it as the gift
for the marriage.
Both getting and giving credit is wrong!
This matter is very good!
What happened? I think there is no petrol.
You fill and go home!
I'll go by auto O.k. Madam!
Super party is coming man!
Oh! She is coming near our auto stand!
I'll select on myself
You come!
Do you know the meaning for handsome? It
means male beauty!
Manikkam! She wants me to come! Know
about me now!
We'd see that man's reaction when I said
handsome! How happy he was
Now a days boys are becoming happy even
if they beautiful girls like scold
Really you're the handsome among them.
What is that? You've written
as your life is in your hand
Yes madam! Our life is
in our hands, isn't it?
Don't you believe God?
Oh! How will we live without God? But God
will take care of us only if we
take care of ourselves. It's good
You're talking indifferently
do you know one thing? What? Japanese will
die if they don't work
Chinese will die if they don't gamble.
Anglos will die if they
don't feel about them proudly. Indian will
die if they don't talk
You're talking well I'm an Indian, isn't
it!
Indiran is coming! Indiran? Who is that? He
is the great rowdy for this area.
He'll come to collect commission every
month. When he come, nobody
should walk, nobody should drive vehicle
Shouldn't talk! If you oppose him
he'll tie us in the poster
and hit vigorously.
Do you want this?
Stop the van. Go back!
Two sights like Ramba and Oorvasi
Start the car! My heart is not with me!
He's insulted our sisters! Instead
of hitting him you're stopping me!
If we throw stone in the mud, the mud will
flare on us
Very bad time it is! We shouldn't involve
in any problem. We can't correct you!
Next candidate? Name is Shiva. Father's
name is Rangasamy. Birthplace Bombay.

come!
For how many years you're driving auto?
For 4 years.
How is this profession? It's

smuggling diamonds here!
Diamonds? Our town has been destroyed!
Go Go
I was thinking about you! Why madam!
You told me that Indian will
die if they don't talk!
Why did you turn? Are you afraid of fights?
Yes madam! I'm afraid of fights!
That's not correct madam! That's wrong!
How do you want me to be? Should wear sari,
flower & bindhi & be with self-control.
Have you got married! No girl has come
behind me madam! I'm feeling bad!
Why don't you go behind a girl!
Men shouldn't go behind Gold, girl, and
praise
All these should come behind men. You're
talking well. Indian, isn't it?
I want to see you often. My auto should be
lucky for you to come!
This is madam's. She's
left this in the auto.
I want to give this to her!
Shall I take it with me! Take it!
What a man you're Stop Stop

Do you know its cost? Many lakhs! Why!
It'd be crore!
Keep it! I'll make a move! Wait! Without
giving this to me if you'd have
kept it with you, do you know how would
you be?
I know! How! With a bungalow like this,
with many relatives
fearing for robbers, without sleep, peace,
and hungry, I'd be roaming!
What are you searching in my purse?
Is this?
Is that with you? I was searching in the
purse Give Give

business newly?
If I buy jewels for daughter's marriage,
will you call me as jewelry seller?

business! Good girl you're!

Where is another one?
I don't know! You came by hotel
taxi, didn't you? No! In an auto!
Auto? Which auto? What number? Can you
identify? I can!
That auto man would've taken the diamond!
Find him somehow and bring!

those diamonds in that auto.
He came on himself and gave me! Definitely
he'd not have taken that!
Very good man! Good man only! It'd have
fallen somewhere in the auto, isn't it!
One diamond's value is 40 lakhs child! Go

We've decided as 7 lakhs for one seat! 7
lakhs?
I can understand your situation well.
You've taken 98./.
I don't want to leave students who are
studious like you.
Sir! Get me a seat somehow sir! Everything
is in your hands sir!
You're an intelligent girl! You understood
correctly. It's in my hands.
Look! You needn't give 7 lakhs. You
needn't pay fee also.
But, you'd do one thing.
I have a guesthouse. If you come there when
I say, you can be well
I too will get relaxation from this bad
tension!

Didn't you get seat? I'll do B. Sc brother!
No need for medical.
I think it'll be tough.
Did you get seat or not?
No need for medical. I should've done
goodness for that.
Should've done goodness? What sin did you
do? I was born in poor family!
I can study at home, or join in hostel and
study I'd go to guesthouse

Who is he? Did you come by auto? Didn't
you pay money?
He's my brother! Have you come to frighten
me?
I don't know all those. What you did is not
correct sir!
You'd have told her that you don't
have seat if you don't have seat.
Sitting in such a great place, you
shouldn't have told like this.
Give my sister a seat! Respectfully
Should I give Respectfully? What will you
do if don't give?
What will you do? Will you go to police?
Will you go to minister?
Will you go to governor? To whom will you
go! I'll phone and give you! Talk!
There is no need for me to go to them.
I have a thing for me.
What? Are you rowdy? I'm a rowdy. That's
first! Then only all these
Throw him out! Sir! 2 minutes! Sir is
telling, isn't it? Why should you talk?
I want to talk to you personally for 2
minutes! I'm telling no! Come man!
Brother want to talk something to me! Let's
ask what is it!
Stay out! Geetha! Be there outside!
Brother!
It's all right! Stay out!
You wanted to talk something! What are you
going to talk?
Sir My name is Manikkam! I have another
name!
You won't tell this outside, will you? No!
If I tell once it is equal to 100 times!
Leave men! Leave men! Why should 1 seat
brother! I'll give you 100 seats!
100? I'll give you 1000 seats brother! This
college itself is yours brother!
Brother! You sit in that chair brother!
Come brother! Please!
I'll make a move! Brother! I'll drop you in
my car It's all right!
You've got the seat.
Yes! What did you speak to him? What did
you tell him? I told the truth.
Is he brother for you? He? Sister's
brother! If he is brother for sister
he is brother for me. If he is brother for
me, he is brother for you.
If he is brother for you, he is
brother for all men! Brother man!
Where do you want to go? To cinema? To
beach? To park?
Else, to any lodge! Brother Forgive me
brother! I refused to come!
He only compelled and brought me out! For
the first time we're coming out
We're friends from school itself.
Geetha also know this.
Oh! Yes! She is elder Head of the
family
How is that? You're arguing for hours for
small matters! This matter!
Important matter! You're going behind for
this alone.
Do you like him more or less?
Do you like him more?
If we don't like him? I swear I
won't look at him thereafter.
Don't tell all these stories to me!
How many we've seen!
Brother! I'll come tomorrow to talk to your
father!
What are you talking man? Keep quiet!
You're an auto driver who is roaming in
streets for 100 and 200 everyday.
How dare you're to come and ask my son as
groom?
Do you know my income? Do you know my
bank balance! Do you know my
assets value? Do you know my influence?
Even if you drive auto throughout
can you earn my one day's income? If you
pull my only son towards you
do you think that you can enjoy my
property through your sister?
Get out man! Stop it! What are you talking
to him?
Will your assets value, bank balance and
influence be equal to his feet's dust?
Do you know who is he? Sir! Mother has
spoken something! Forgive me!
Sir! Both boy and girl won't forget their
love that appears in their first love.
We can't wipe that
first love from their
heart even if they get
married with another.
That will change as throne and pierce them
throughout their life time.
Why should we do such sin? Their
happiness is our happiness!
I've come to your house to join them
together.
Though our daughter is not goddess in
money, she is goddess in character.
With love, with discipline, we have thought
her how to be in husband's house!
Definitely she won't be
like daughter-in-law
for this house! She'll
be like daughter.
She'll save your dignity, she'll save you,
she'll take care of everything.
Don't avoid this marriage. Whatever you
say, how much ever be the expenses
I'll conduct this marriage beyond my
capacity. Join them together.
I'll fall under your feet and ask! Why are
you falling under his feet?
I can't see my son falling under anybody's
feet!
If I give my daughter to the family, which
considers money as important thing
definitely she won't be happy. It's not
good if the boy alone is good!
Only if the mother-in-law, father-in-law be
good, our daughter can live peacefully.
I don't believe that my daughter will live
peacefully in this family.
We don't want this marriage. Come! Let's
go! Mother! Don't hurry!
Look! My honor and dignity is not matter!
Kavitha's life problem.
It's elders, our duty to give
he life that she wished.
For that we can do anything. For that there
is no need to fall in anybody's feet!
I can't see my brother to fall under
anybody's feet for me!
I'll take all these as dream and forget it.
I'll live in the proud that I'm your sister
throughout my life.
Come brother! Let's go! I'll make a move
sir! Wait
I thought that poor will do anything for
money.
Today I've understood that their
family honor is greater than money.
Mother who doesn't leave son, sister who
doesn't leave brother
Brother who was ready to lose his honor for
his sister!
I should be lucky to get a daughter-in-law
from such a family. I've agreed man!
From today your daughter is my daughter-in-
law! No My daughter!
Marriage in the next Mugoortham! Very
happy!
Father! I've fulfilled your second wish.
Why are you talking idiotically? Do you
have sense?
You've given the diamonds and come
without getting the money?
Sir! George's party is not correct. Both of
them have cheated us.
Those who said that we'll give money on 5
o'clock after getting diamonds
have booked flight ticket to go to Dubai at
Are they trying to cheat this Kesavan? No!
They shouldn't be alive!
Before they go to the airport, close them.
Is this Our Priya? You're looking very
beautiful in Sari!
What child! You're looking indifferent?
Nothing! Where have you started?
In which car are you going? By auto! What
child! You're roaming in auto
I'll drop you today. Come! No need! Come
child! Come
Manikkam! That man? Kesavan! What can
we do now? That girl is coming!
I'll take care.
Somebody has dropped you, isn't it! Who is
he? Is he your father? Yes!
Where do you want to go? Adyar! Sorry!
Auto won't go to Adyar side!
It'll go to Egmore side! We'll go to Egmore
then. No! Auto won't come today.
I want to talk an important matter to you!
Please! Sit!
You said that you want to talk an important
matter!
I want to talk about an
important matter and decide.
Do you want to talk to me and decide? What
is that? Tell me?
A girl after moving with a man for a long
time if she finds that he is a smuggler
murderer, gangster, what should she do?
It's good for her to be away from him.
That whomever it is? What is there in
person? Bad man is a bad man.
Do you know, who that bad man is? Who?
My father.
Another matter. Tell me! A girl after
moving with a man for a long time
finds that though he's poor, he is
innocent, graceful man, good man
what should that girl do? If she like her
she should tell him that she love him.
Is that whomever it is? If
she likes him, isn't it?
What is there in whoever it is?
Do you know who is he? Who? It's you
only! I love you
Get down please! Get down please!
Look! I don't know that you're moving with
this thought.
If I'd known it before, I
wouldn't have seen you at all.
It's too long between love and me. It won't
fit me!
There are so many for that itself.
See them! Leave me! Bye!
Are you thinking that I'm joking? You're
leaving me, aren't you?
Whatever be the time, or whatever be the
number of days, I won't move
from this place unless you come and take
me.
I won't move from this place unless you
come and take me.
Don't think that I've changed my heart as
I've come again and taking you.
I came in humanity. Don't judge anybody
externally.
Everything seems to be new today. Priya
wore Sari. That is new

Do you know today brother will come!
Won't you keep it ready seeing brother?
What? Are you talking opposing when I'm
asking? Leave me! What?
Are you talking opposing when I'm asking?
Don't beat me sir!
Leave me! You'll long live!
Do you know what brother will do if you
didn't give money? Don't break!
Vanakkam brother! I heard that you became
our area inspector
I felt very happy! There
is a rule for police!
Let it be itself! But there is another
rule as how to behave with others!
That's this Indiran's rule! You don't know!
There will be great officers than you!
You ask them & find! You'll be alive! Else!
You'll die!
Brother! Somehow small boy spoke without
knowing Brother you go!
What will you do?
This is Indiran's kingdom! Indiran's rule
only can exist!
Here your law & duty won't do anything
This Indiran didn't speak in front
of anybody this much of time!
I'd tie you in poster & remove your
skin for your talk in front of me!
But leaving for this Go!
Don't do anything to my brother!
If anybody talks in front of this
Indiran then I'd tie in poster & beat!
He had beaten my people! I won't tie him &
beat! I'm going to kill & throw
Listen to me! Keep quiet! Somehow he is a
boy who has no knowledge
He did without knowing! Don't do him
anything
whatever may be the punishment, give me!
Leave my brother! I beg you
Take this donor!
We won't bear hereafter! Don't get emotion
all of you
Your brother came to save you! Save your
brother if you can
Tie him in poster!
See Batsha! See his innocent face!
See his calm character! See his
infant smile while bleeding
See his patience like Lord Jesus while
making him as pieces
See he is a candle, which gives light while
it's whole body is burning
Who is that sinner changed his horoscope?
Who had put wet cloth in this Volcano?
Who had put wet cloth in this Volcano?
What is this brother? He had beaten like
this
You was standing getting beats without
having little bit of sense itself
Even an cat will get angry for protection!
Didn't you ever beat anyone till now? Don't
you get angry?
We have come with arrest warrant to arrest
you
Who? Who is that human, gave arrest
warrant to this Indiran?
Mum! I'll go out & come! Where are you
going at this time?
I'm having an important job! I'll come
soon
Where is this Geetha? She went saying she
is going market! It's still an hour!
But didn't come yet I'm getting afraid
Didn't she come yet? This naughty girl
Vanakkam inspector brother! Prison is like
guesthouse to me
They sent me out putting garland & giving
respect within 4 days
You sent me in to show your brave for
beating your brother in the poster
If I rape your sister in this place
itself now then what you will do?
What he can do sinner! He will
sent us in for another 4 days
I'll come out! Do you know who will remain
in your family after I come out?
Get up!
Get in!
Get in!
If I see you in this
place again, I'll dig
ditch & bury you in the
place where I see you.
If I say once; it's equal to 100 times
4 persons could not walk & laying in the
hospital
Three of them are in intensive
care unit & in worse condition
Doctors has given 24 hours time for their
soul
Indiran is one of those 3! When 4 rowdies
tore your auto in the public road
You're laughing! When a rowdy kindled
your sister on whom you love very much
You didn't shout at once & returned
When a man tied you in a poster & beat the
city watched you in that heavy rain
You're calm like the one who was born to
get beats & got beats from them
Doctors who are treating the men whom you
beat yesterday were afraid
They are telling that this is
not an ordinary man's hit!
A man who has fighting sense mixed in
nerve, muscle, blood & mind
only can beat like this If anyone dies in
them whom you had beaten
I myself must arrest you!
Brother! Tell! Who are you? What were you
doing in Bombay?
Was this cruelness your life? Is what you
were showing acting?
Are you getting afraid that your acting is
spoiled?
Why are you talking nothing? You're hiding
something from us then
Tell! I must know now itself who are you?
What were you doing in Bombay?
Tell! What? Is it an inquiry?
Is this a praising certificate for saving
you from those rowdies facing risk?
To whom are you talking? There is no day
for me without starving
that I didn't have a son like this
Goodness you did in some birth
you've got a brother like this!
Did he treat you any day like other mum's
children?
You're making him to stand like a culprit
and asking questions as he saved
this family by working hardly! What
mistake did he do?
If anybody keep hand on the matured girl,
old lady I'll go to kill him
He is brave male! What is wrong in beating
them?
Look! You come home as his brother leaving
your police mind out
Else I'll assume that he is alone my son &
you get out in that way itself
Tell! I must know now itself! Who are you?
What were you doing in Bombay?
Tell! I must know now itself! Who are you?
What were you doing in Bombay?
See this Batsha & his bravest military
walk
See the Force, on which enemies gets fear &
tiger, which has worn coat, suit
See the eyes, which is
hot like burning fire
He is a emperor of that kingdom, which has
sweat & blood
There is an attraction in his name!
It's true!
He is Antony's man! Do you know Antony?
Who is that? I don't know!
Are you our man? In Tamil Nadu everyone
are fighting between themselves
Let's be together at least in out station!
What were you doing in Anderi area in
today's morning?
I came to temple? Will you come to temple
usually?
I used to come temple every week! Which
temple? Pillayar temple
Did you come last week? I came! I
didn't see you I'm telling I came
You didn't come! I came! You didn't come!
I came! What's your name?
Were all the churches closed recently?
If Albert, should I go to
church alone & not to temple?
Can come! You brought a blue bag, when
you came
where has it gone when you left? I didn't
bring
Do you know in front of whom you are
talking?
If you don't tell the truth then your dead
body only will go out from here
See! You've found I'm Antony's man now!
Do you know what Antony will do if you
beat me?
Don't talk about Antony! This Batsha know
how to get the truth from you
Don't give me strain! Tell the truth
Do you know that if this Batsha says once
then it's equal to 100 times?
Tell! Why you came to Anderi? What were
in the bag? Tell!
Tell! I don't know! Don't you know? I don't
know!
I'll tell! Tell! I came to keep bomb in
Pillayar temple
Where did you keep? At the back of statue!
When will it blast? At 10'o clock
There are only 10 minutes more yet
Batsha took that bomb, which we kept in
Pillayar temple
Gurumurthy from Batsha's home! Batsha sir
wants to meet you today itself
It's very important matter! You
yourself fix the place I'll tell!
Why your son didn't come yet? Has he got
afraid?
I didn't see him getting afraid Then why
didn't he come yet?
He will come! He won't tell! If he
says then he will do definitely.
He has come
What Manik? Are you fine?
What's the matter brother? You wanted to
talk something to me?
Do you need any help? Tell!
I'll do whatever you need
You're our Rangasamy's son! Tell!
See! There is conflict between you & me
only!
There is fight between this Batsha & Antony
only
You'd die or I'd die in this! Your people
should die or my people should
Not citizens & innocent people! I've
come to know now! You're a coward!
I don't like to fight with a coward This
Manik Batsha is not like that
I'll finish! I'll kill
you in just seven days
Do you know to whom are you talking? I
know dad
I'm talking the truth to a criminal!
He is a small boy!
You're new to this business! You're baby!
What you told?
Will you kill me in only seven days?
I'll kill you in only seven minutes
Don't you understand? See just upwards
Dear! You just look there
I'll say a thing! You know it well!
God will test good people too much!
But he won't leave them! He will offer many
to worse people! But he will leave!
See the Batsha! He only will become true
ever
Batsha's plans will succeed! If we say his
name in Bombay!
Arabic sea will get afraid! He will say &
spoil the worse men's plans
He is a brave man who moves in upside even
if enemies comes in 100 images!
It's true that there is an
attraction in his name!
If I'd kill your son on that day itself he
couldn't stand &
talk in front of this Antony! Your
affection stopped you!
That itself became a Yemen to us now! Will
you see I'll kill him?
Give a last chance! I'll talk to him! O.
K Go! This is last chance to you! Go!
You yourself know about our son! He will
do what he thinks as correct
We didn't see him making mistake
Manikkam didn't like from the beginning
that you're working to Antony
To hide these from his brother & sister
only he made them to stay in hostel
at outstation & educating them with his
money itself
You know yourself that in what situation
Manikkam fights to Antony
If you are in that stage then you'd also do
that only
You told our son must not come to our home
when he changed as Batsha
How his heart will be suffering! You think
yourself
Will Manikkam in home only tomorrow?
Tomorrow is Friday
First he will go to Anwar's symmetry & then
will come home
Making me to struggle lonely; you're
sleeping here calmly!
All those happened are like dreams
We both were brought up & lived together
from childhood itself
Whole city people would happy looking our
friendship
A criminal named Antony entered
in our life, which was calm
They told to vacate 1000 of poor people,
who were in our area
We nobody accepted that! So Antony started
torturing with different kinds
When you got angry without bearing that I
stopped & consoled you!
Anybody save me! I told to take action
legally
You didn't have faith on that! I complained
to police without hearing your talk
They tore it! I gave
petition to minister also!
They were not ready to enquire what's that
also
All were Antony's person & his kingdom
only
Finally on a day Antony came to our area
He threatened that he would if we all
didn't vacate the place immediately
When all ran getting fear of his gun's
bullet you & me alone stood bravely
He would shoot both of us there itself! But
my dad fell on his feet
He sent both of us alive
All people stood bravely with us before
Antony comes
All ran when he showed gun! Why should
not they run?
He had law, men's support, political
support police & money support
If we destroy Antony then there is only one
way for that
What's the way? We should go in his path &
destroy him
Are you telling us to change
as criminal like Antony then?
Nobody tells him a criminal who saves
innocent people from a criminal
It's not important that how we are
struggling!
It's important that for what & for whom we
are struggling
If anything happens in this struggle to any
one of us What? You're talking like this!
We brought up & lived together from
childhood!
If we die then we should die together only
I'm telling for an example
If anything happens to me like that then
you'd struggle
If at any cost this Anwar Batsha won't be
with you; then God will be!
This Batsha will also with me & that God
also will with me
All are running who are in city! These 2
boys were standing bravely
They're thinking that they're great men! He
would shoot & kill both there itself
He left Manikkam alone when he came to
know he is my son
Then what about Anwar? He would have
been killed
Sinner! They killed this Anwar brother
without justice like this
Who killed? I'm asking loudly that who
killed him I killed him!
I only killed
Dad! When did you come? Did you eat
anything?
You came at first time to my home! I'd
speak some to you alone
What? Do you think that Batsha means great
emperor?
This Rangasamy only knows about that
Antony!
Whole Government is in his hand! He'd kill
even his mum if she opposes him
Are you thinking why I'm working to him
who is worse like that?
When I came to this Bombay like an orphan
without anything; he offered me food
He gave me job! He gave me life! I ate his
food!
Whatever may be he is my owner! I won't
bear those who opposes my owner
Don't oppose Antony! What are you telling?
You'd live long for 100 years
Did Batsha accept? Start the car
Batsha is coming! Who? Manik Batsha?
Send him inside
I didn't steal from anybody & didn't burnt
any hut
I didn't rape any girl & didn't harm
anybody
I'm saving from Antony who is doing
these
I'm doing that duty without uniform, what
duty you're doing with uniform
Money, which I'm having is not poor &
good people's! Bad men's money!
Money, which I got from them who are
earning doing illegal things! See!
All are with people! You're getting afraid
seeing Antony
You're getting fear seeing his proud & his
political force
There is no fear to this Batsha!
I'll get afraid only for God
I won't work asking this! I'll work asking
this alone
You decide on yourself whether to support
Antony or Batsha?
Give her food!
What? Batsha's persons, whom we caught,
came out
How? Now the police are in Batsha's side
You do one thing! Call all dawns
that are in Bombay Call today itself
Including Batsha! That's your son
See! All tell that if home is got
split then it's festival for partner
If there is a fight in us then
police men only will have profit
They are waiting that we
should beat in us & die
We should not give room for that! Batsha &
Antony are not enemies' hereafter
Friends! I won't interfere
in your business!
Like that you must not in mine
This is good for you, me & all of us
I didn't come to this business
to earn money or proud
I came to this business in order to destroy
you only! I'm saying now also!
You stop your crimes, ask sorry kneeling
down in Anwar's symmetry
& surrender in police else you run out
of my sight somewhere
I'll leave you! Don't have
political games to me like this
I'm saying a thing to you all! You're doing
business by the fear to Antony
you're working against conscience! You'd
not get fear of him
If you trust on this Batsha then come with
me! God & I will save you!
Do all of you know? If this Batsha says
once then it's equal to 100 times?
See Batsha who rules the Bombay! See his
force, which exist
See 10 floored building also will bend if
Batsha comes
See! If they print money in Nasik
city, there is a part for Batsha also
There is an attraction in his name!
It's true
People could not bear Antony's kingdom,
torture & were
starving thinking won't anyone come
opposing him
People are trusting that,
that God itself sent you
This Batsha won't like those who are
praising in front
You'll kill praising anyone too much!
If there is anything bad then
tell in front of our face!
Say good things at back! No! Your birthday
is going to come in one day
You didn't celebrate your birthday till
now
So I arranged a big hotel in Obrai without
asking you
Asking whom you arranged! No need of
these celebration and all
Even if others are wanting; our Kesavaiah
wants so much
Let him do! O. K! If he do, not in outside!
We will keep it in our home itself
What Kesavaiah tells for this? What's there
in place?
We should celebrate your birthday well!
That's important
We will keep here itself! You allowed!
That's enough for me
We will perform well! Thank very much!
When I see this man I'm afraid! Fear caan
be there in life
But fear itself should not be our life
There is only one moon for hole night
There is only one moon for hole night
There is only one sun for whole daytime!
There is only one sun for whole daytime!
There is only one Batsha for this whole
world
There is only one Batsha for this whole
world
There is only one Batsha for this whole
world
There is only one Batsha for this whole
world

Forgive me! I did like this
by that Antony's order only
Forgive at least this time
When you started to praise me, I understood
that you're going to kill me!
Have you ever seen this Batsha danced &
sung?
Would not you know then itself that I've
come to know your plan?
Go! Be faithful at least to Antony!
Won't do me anything? Isn't it?
Go! If this Batsha says once means
it's equal to 100 times I know!
I said to kill Batsha; but
you've begged for soul
Hereafter there is no use on trusting you
I'll kill him on myself
We vacated all in our housing colony & sent
other place as you told
But Antony keeps bomb on that place! Let
him keep!
Antony planned to keep bomb in our people
welfare trust! Let him do!
Antony come to know that Babu in Antony's
group is our man!
Antony is going to kill Babu! Let him kill!
All my people are now your side! You've a
big group also
Nobody won who gathered groups! This
Antony is single man
But equal to 1000 men! I destroyed your
kingdom itself
It seems something came in paper about you!
Take & look the paper!
What did you tell? You told nobody can win
who gathered groups, isn't it?
It's true only! But I do not
gather group in my side
Group gathered itself by love! Mine is
different & love kingdom!
Nobody can destroy this
On that day itself I told! I'll punish you
within & days!
Today is 7th day! I've punished you! Police
are going to come in some time
To take in Your permanent place! This day
is greatest day in Manik Batsha's life
My friend Anwar's soul
gets saturated today!
Do you remember which I told?
God will test good people! But won't leave
them!
God will offer many to worse people! But he
will leave them!
Have you seen? He left you!
Congratulations!
I accepted you as great man! Even if he is
great; he will do a small mistake
Do you know what's the mistake you did?
You sent your dad to me
If you didn't come before police comes then
he won't alive for you to call dad!
Forgive me! I don't know any other way
Don't come! Go! Don't come! You return!
What are you doing?
Say that Batsha only killed Antony's
family
I wanted to make your brother
and sisters to study well.
Make doctor! Make inspector! I wanted to
make them married in a good family.
Will you fulfill that? Definitely! I
swear I'll fulfill definitely father!
But not as this Batsha! As Manikkam! No
need for this Batsha.
No need for Bombay. Father! Go Go
somewhere Promise me!
I swear father; I'm not Batsha hereafter
father! Father! Father
Batsha too has died when Batsha's father
died. He's not alive.
For the people. Arrange for that.
Smuggler Batsha has died in a bomb blast
In the hospital those 3 persons who were
there in the intensive care
have become all right because of God's
grace.
Where have you started in this time? My
wish. I'll go anywhere
You can go anywhere. But you shouldn't go
to that auto man alone.
You've come to know, isn't it! I'm going to
him only.
I'm going to marry him alone. I'm going to
live with him only.
Look! You can go anywhere. I don't care
about that.
But, all the properties are in your name.
Am I a fool to leave that auto man to enjoy
those property?
Tomorrow is your marriage. Morning at 9
o'clock. He's your husband!
Hereafter you'll be here,
this idiot too will be here!
My property will be with me
Are you a father? Did I tell?
You're telling!
I'm going out of this house!
You can't go anywhere hereafter.
Father has arranged for my marriage
tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.
If you don't come and save me within that,
wedding rope will get into my neck
but soul won't be there in my body. You
know about me, don't you?
You should come and save me. Else Come
and save me!
Save me please
Stop it!

Batsha hasn't dead. He's alive yet!
Smuggler King Antony has escaped. He's
escaped from Bombay jail.
When did you come? Oh! God You've
become like this!
I tried to see you in the jail. They didn't
allow me inside!
I wrote many letters! You got, didn't you?

Before he becomes alert bring his family
here.
Look Moorthi! Take Shankar, Thaya,
Dinesh, find where mother and
sisters are Place them safely in a safe
place.
Come men!
They've kidnapped Priya and sister before
we go.
You've found that your brother Manikkam is
Batsha, Haven't you?
The time has come to tell you the truth.
You're telling somebody's name as Batsha.
Who is he?
What is the relation between him and us?
He's your brother! Brother? Who said? What
do you know about our family?
Madam! Vijaya Lakshmi madam! Didn't
you tell this truth to them so far?
We've found Antony's car.
Antony has kept many bombs around this
house! Take off everything.
Careful
Come! Batsha sir! Come I thought already
that you'd have finished everything.
Knowing this only, I've kept bomb around
this house. Do you want to see?
I've taken out all the bombs!
I thought you'd have forgotten all your old
games as you became auto driver.
I too didn't forget! You can't do anything
with it! See there
No No Manikkam! You're not old Batsha.
Auto driver Manikkam.
No No Manikkam!
Without knowing about you correctly, I've
spoken something. Forgive me brother!
No girl will like a bad man. Be happy I'll
make a move!
My Batsha is not bad man.
I'm an Auto man! Auto man who knows all
the routs, have fair rate
