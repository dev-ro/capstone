{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Even after living for 35 years in
 U.S., whenever I come to India...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I feel as though I've come to the
 warmth of my mother's lap. Today...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...my India may have something
 to offer, or not, but she has...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...one thing in abundance, and
 that is love. The air here...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...the buildings here,
 echo with one word - Love.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}One such building
 is... The Taj Mahal.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My American friends... in U.S.,
 Love means give and take.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But in India it means
 give, give and give!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And there comes another
 unbelievable thing...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How is your family?
 - My wife is very peeved with you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This time I'll make it up to her.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You've become a big-wig now.
 You last come to us 10 years ago!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- My kids are dying to meet you.
 - I'm packing off this lot.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll accompany you to Dehra Dun
 and spend 3-4 days with your kids.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Put your window up, friend.
 It's getting dusty inside.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We've grown up in this dust...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...so how can we stop
 it from coming in?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The scent of this dust from
 India is out of this world.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}For 35 years you've been living in
 the U.S., but you haven't changed.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You must be the first Indian to have
 earned so much money and fame there.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You're coming to my house
 after exactly 10 years!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We sold our house at Dehra Dun and
 built a house amidst our land.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My brother lives in the city.
 My mother, wife and I live here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Since it's vacation time,
 it's full house at home.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Kulvanti and her kids are here, too.
 And they're all awaiting you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...as though some film star
 from Mumbai is expected!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}See! We're caught right here.
 This is Ganga, my daughter.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The same. Our little Kusum.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Look who's here, dear.
 - Don't tell me. Let me guess...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You're American-uncle, Dad's friend.
 25 years ago... No!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}35 years ago, you went there
 with Rs. 10,000 in hand.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Today you're rich!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You've a huge family with
 18 sons, 11 daughters...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}9 daughters-in-law, 3 sisters, 3
 brothers, cars and helicopters too!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And which is that city, Dad?
 You live in Hollywood...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...where all the American movie
 stars live. And your bungalow is...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Won't you touch his feet
 and pay your respects?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Bless you. - My son...
 - I'll go tell Mom.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Tell her what? They're all
 activated as it is. - What happened?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come along at least.
 A royal welcome awaits you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Master is here with
 his American friend.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What do you mean? He's here?!
 - What! He has come? Today?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Somebody get my "chunni"
 Get aside, will you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Did you have to sit here only?
 - Come, friend... - Wow!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What a lovely farm-house!
 - My "chunni", kids! Hurry!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Is that American here?
 - He's here, sis. - How are you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is height of shamelessness.
 I'm going...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Namaste...
 - Namaste...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Honestly! You didn't tell me...
 - So what? I'm no stranger.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- True, but...
 - Good you came.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We were expecting you tomorrow.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Anyway, now that
 you're here, welcome.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I hear you're a big-wig now.
 - For you, I'm the same little boy.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I need your blessings, in fact.
 So...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- But how can I bless you, son?
 - Why not? - Cow-dung!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}They are Nitin, Sonali,
 Daksha, Dabboo...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That N.R.I. Is being fussed over
 as though he's God!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That Surajdev has an complex
 about foreign countries!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I know him for 10 years!
 - You are an N.R.I. Too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why don't they fuss over you?
 - They will, my dear. They will.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You'll see.
 - When, Dad? When?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}When he'll come with a proposal
 for his daughter Ganga.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}When will he do that?
 Years have gone by...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Then fix it once and for all.
 - Fix it? Without deciding dowry?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You've pretty silly. I've educated
 this boy; made him a body-builder.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What for?
 - Then go and meet them.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A variety of gourmet dishes have
 been made for this richie-rich!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Wow! What a delicious dinner. I used
 to return from Delhi and Mumbai.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But the fruits and vegetables
 of rural India are unique.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And why not? When they're from
 the fields of the Sun God!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is Amirchand. My mother's
 sister-in-laws, sister's son!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Why don't you say
 a distant-cousin?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sir, I'm Amirchand, my brother
 Garibchand, and my wife Bhagyashri.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- He's an N.R.I. Too.
 - Which country do you come from?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Not now. He used to live
 in Sri Lanka. - So what?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}An Indian coming from Sri-Lanka is
 an NRI, too! - We're small people.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Variety of rich dishes are laid out
 for you. - We're not even invited!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Amirchand, come here and
 open your complaints book.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- My respects, Auntie.
 - Right. How are you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Uncle. Take your medicine
 for the evening.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- My dose? - You're to take your
 dose everyday at 7 p.m. And 9 a.m.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- 9 a.m., 7 p. M...
 - Who told you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Tell me. Who told you.
 - I was ironing your overcoat...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...a slip fell out from it.
 It said what you are to eat...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And also what not too.
 It was signed "Arjun".
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This is his work, eh?
 - Who's this Arjun?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He's my 18th son.
 Son of my distant sister.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He sees to my every personal need.
 I call him my "Little Master".
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He has penned a lovely song.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Have your dose first then go
 on about "I love India".
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Auntie, why is our Ganga...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...buttering that man so much?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You always smell of jealousy!
 Here, have some water.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This uncle can take us to U.S.A.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How?
 - If we impress him, that is.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- But how?
 - You ass... - Ass?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...with our music.
 - That too English music.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Idiot! He's an out and
 out Indian American.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}If you try to impress
 him, it'll backfire!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Shall we bet on it?
 - Done! - One moment.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Do you remember our
 song's English notes?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've seen London, I've seen Paris
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}and I've seen Japan
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've seen Michael (Jackson), I've seen Elvis; 
I've seen it all, my darling;
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}and in all the world there is no other India,
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}no other India...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This world is a bride,
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This world is a bride,
and the bindi on the bride's forehead...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}is this India of mine, this India of mine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This world is a bride,
and the bindi on the bride's forehead 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}is this India of mine, this India of mine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It took a fabulous tune to
--make the rains descend.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The water lit on fire
--at the sound of the Deepak raga.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This life is a garland made of songs, 
the meeting of the seven notes.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We even call our God 'the flute player.' 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This India of mine
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The cuckoo caws, pihu pihu!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The crow sings, kuhu kuhu!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}In laughter and tears, 
we Indians made all of life's songs.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This whole world sings to our songs.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sing the song from which 
the fragrance of this earth arises.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}India, my homeland; India, my beloved.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This world 
--this world
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}is a bride,
--is a bride
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This world is a bride,
and the bindi on the bride's forehead 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}is this India of mine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}India, my homeland; India, my beloved.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}India, my fate; India, my religion.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You can't be serious!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I am very much serious.
 For my son Rajiv...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...Im asking your daughter's
 hand in marriage.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look. Rajiv's mother
 died 3 years back.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You know Rajiv is my only son.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He was born and brought up there.
 He hasn't seen India as yet.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But he definitely knows the hearts...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and the thoughts of his Indian
 parents, and he respects them.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm asking your daughter's hand
 because...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...we N.R.I. S need girls
 like her very badly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Because we've pushed our kids so
 deeply in English books and manners
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That somewhere or the other,
 even after seeing so much success...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...we feel as though we're failures.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And seeing all this...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...today, girls like Ganga
 are our only source of hope.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That's why I've decided that by
 making her my son's wife...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...Ill take her from this
 house, to that house.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But by asking you
 with folded hands.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What nonsense! The fact that she
 will go into such a loving family...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...is so comforting.
 There's just one hitch...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- We're village folks...
 - Don't make such cheap remarks.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You know me well, don't you?
 Leave the rest for later.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll phone you from America.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No! A girl whom I don't send
 to Delhi or Mumbai...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...Ill allow to go to America?
 Never! - Try to understand.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Vices depend on one's upbringing
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Not the nation.
 And America's not far.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}How times have changed!
 You'll send her to America?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Make her a foreigner?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Oh come on, mother...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Today the whole nation
 is westernized.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And Ganga has
 graduated in English.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look at our own kids.
 All twenty-four hours...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...they watch musical channels
 which show Michael Jackson!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Don't be adamant about it.
 I've given my word to my friend.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We had given our word to that
 Amirchand too, for his son.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No... we hadn't given
 any word to Amirchand.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We had said we'd think about it.
 And that son of his...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...he drinks heavily.
 - Then go and talk to him.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- They are under that impression.
 - So let them be!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My Ganga will marry my friend's son.
 And that's my final decision!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How can you decide by yourself?
 - You should've thought about it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You should've taken some advice.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Enough! Ganga will marry my
 friend's son, and that's that!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}American uncle has gone,
 but he left some snaps...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...of his family and son Rajiv.
 - Really? Show us... - No!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But your father doesn't know
 which is Rajiv's photograph.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What! - Yes, because he forgot
 to ask and uncle forgot to tell!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Show me then. I'll tell you.
 - Hands off!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll show you...
 First of all the family.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is American uncle
 with his brother.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This is his sister-in-law.
 - Looks strict!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This is Padma, his sister.
 - She's fashionable.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And this is his mother, Krishna.
 - A wholesome mother.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now the confusion sets in.
 There are 2 heroes!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And you've to guess which one
 is Ganga's! - Show me at least.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll show you. Now the first hero.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now, the second one.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now you have to guess
 which of the two here...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...is her hero!
 - Yes. Go ahead and guess.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Take your time, sis.
 - Shall I tell you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I say it's this one!
 - And I say...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...sister's hero is this one!
 - Sis...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...you guess which
 of the two is Rajiv.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Shall I show you?
 - Yes, go on.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, show us...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- My respects. - Be happy.
 - Did you call me?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes I did. Is it true...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...that you've asked your friend's
 daughter's hand in marriage? - Yes.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And I've also given him my word.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Good. But Kishorilal...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...do you know this too, that
 you're trying to bring...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...Indias pure Ganges to these
 concrete jungles of America?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I know it. But how about
 our future generation?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Our Indian culture?
 Who will preserve it for us?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Rajiv will never agree to it.
 - He'll never.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Our sons don't like to visit India,
 how will they choose an Indian girl?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}They are westernized, and for
 them to marry Indian girls?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Impossible!
 - I'll make the impossible possible.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And my Arjun. My Little Master.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Some day I will meet you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But who knows when 
you'll shower down your love;
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}my heart is thirsty, my lonely heart! 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Just step out from the picture in my mind
and come before me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Arjun Sagar, is one of U.S.A. 's,
 Canada's and U.K. 's...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...upcoming artists whose
 song, "I Love My India"...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...is topping the Asian Music Chart.
 Let's now meet him.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}How did you come from
 India to the U.S.A.?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}By Air-India! Actually, I...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I was born in a town called Mathura.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- The town of Lord Krishna?
 - Yes, that's right.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But I'm not Krishna, I'm Arjun.
 That too, from these modern times.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Actually, I was 10 years old
 when my parents died.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My father was a musician,
 and my mother, a school teacher.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I was just living a life
 of an orphan, when Kishorilal...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...who was like a brother to
 my mother, came into my life.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Then?
 - Then I came to America, and...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...I worked in
 a garage for 3 years.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Plied a taxi for 4 years.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And then Kishorilal made me
 a manager in his own garage.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Today he's my father...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...deity, God... everything!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}When he came to know that
 I love singing and dancing...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...he built a work-studio for me.
 Where we do our work...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and our rehearsals too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Any regrets? - No.
 - Any siblings? - No.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Any relations? - No.
 - A Beloved? - Only in songs.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Ever loved anyone? - Never!
 - Why is that?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Never found one.
 - Who's your dream-girl?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}An Indian girl...
 I don't really know.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Because she's in my mind...
 In paintings. I haven't met her.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How long have you been
 away from India? - 5 years.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Your future plans?
 - It's only to...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...raise my father's house in
 Mathura and build a music school.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Where poor kids can come, and...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Yes Rajiv? - Where are you?
 Daddy wants you. Go home now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Has he called me now? - He has
 chosen an Indian girl for me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- That's why he wants you.
 - Has he called me alone?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Don't worry. I'll meet him.
 - Else, he'll parcel me to India!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Just one last question.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Sorry, but I've to go.
 - It's an important question.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, didn't I just tell you that
 nobody is an important as Kishorilal?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Not even me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Arjun, Rajiv has
 never gone to India...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and nor does he want to!
 But I want him to go there.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}To breathe the fragrance there...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}To understand the values there.
 And choose the Ganga there.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}To agree to marry her
 with all his heart.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Just think that this is
 my life's most important...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and beautiful dream.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Which only you can fulfill for
 Rajiv is your friend, and...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No, Daddy. Don't you worry.
 I promise you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv will agree to marry Ganga!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Give Monica 5 days leave.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Take that as an order from me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Who sent these flowers?
 - That friend of yours...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I sent them, sir.
 - Welcome, welcome.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How do you like them?
 - They're beautiful, and...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I also know why you've sent them.
 Advocating for Daddy, are you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I know I've to go to India
 with you. Look around...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Approve the girl and...
 - You know everything...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Daddy did one good thing.
 He gave me the right to choose.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Meaning?
 - He left the choice to me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come and see India once at least.
 You'll like it very much.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I knew you'd join us too.
 So, I booked 3 tickets to Delhi.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- By Air-India!
 - Why Air-India?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sis! Sis! We got the information.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Sis! - What is it?
 - We got the news! - What news?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Who's to be your husband.
 - Who? - You won and he lost.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, I did lose. Here's your
 prince Rajiv's photo...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}"O, Ganga, you're going abroad?"
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}"Leaving your country?..."
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ganga, where are you going, 
breaking your promise, abandoning us?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love, my love
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Where my love is, there I must be.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He made me forsake my country; 
he called me abroad.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This letter came with my name on it. 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Where my love is, there must I be.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I must be where he is;
what can I do, my God?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Where my love is, there I must be.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love is there, so must I be.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It seems as though something 
is breaking inside me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}In my father's courtyard, 
I am letting go of my childhood.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm happy as well as sad,
like being thirsty amidst rivers.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What will I do, my God?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Where my love is, there I must be.
My love is there, so must I be.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A cup of silver, a box of gold...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Bring them, mother; 
my mother-in-law has called me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Blush, kohl, powder, bindi...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Bring them, mother; 
my beloved has called me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}"Ganga, where are you going, 
breaking your promise, abandoning us?"
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I go there...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What is it?
 - Get up! Your prince is here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What! - Yes. Come and see.
 - No. I don't want to.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come on... see for yourself.
 Ram hasn't come, but Krishna has!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What are you talking about?
 - Rajiv is still in Delhi.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- He has sent some Arjun
 to see to things. - What?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, uncle... Try to understand
 what I'm saying.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv is totally American. He will
 not stand this heat and dust.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And the stink! If something
 stinks... I mean, he'll go mad!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Do you know what'll happen if
 he comes here? He'll faint!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He'll faint first, then come
 to his senses and just fly off!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No. We're with you. Last night
 Kishorilal told me everything.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So now do as I tell you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- First remove these cows from here.
 - The buffaloes, son.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Whatever. Then send these
 goats away some place.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Now this... does he bite?
 - No. Just barks.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You'll have to shift him because
 Rajiv is allergic to dogs.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Is this cot for the dog?
 - That cot...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- It's our servant's cot.
 - No no. He can't sleep here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Build a servant quarter for him.
 Everything must've its own set up.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Uncle, you do follow me, don't you?
 We must clean up this place fast!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This straw here...
 - It's cow-dung, son.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ramu... that's your name, right?
 Just throw this out at once.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Son, Kishorilal...
 - Not him; talk about the son.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He won't stand all this, so,
 it's vital that we clean up.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Pompous, isn't he?
 - Tells us to oust our dog!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Asks Ramu to sleep out.
 - Is he a human or a beast?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll turn this beast
 into a man pretty soon.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How?
 - I've a remedy for it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What will you do? What idea?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Says our Ganga...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You are? - Daksha, a cousin.
 - Good. Sit down please.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And you?
 - Shake hands at least...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I'm the brother... only one.
 - Please stand here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Where's Ganga? Didn't see her.
 - Come in, Sis...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Don't remove your glasses.
 I'm really Ganga.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So then... that is... you are
 chosen by Daddy for Rajiv?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, when uncle saw me,
 he said he won't find such...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...lovely Ganga in the whole of
 India! Isn't that so? - Sure.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Daddy was right! We won't
 find a girl like you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...in this whole world,
 let alone India.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Is there a... te... telephone here?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Will you let me talk to Rajiv?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come along... Not you.
 You sit right here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Book a call please. Yes...
 'Lightning' call will do.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, I know it cost's 8 times more.
 Charge 16 times more, even 32...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...but I must get the call through.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Let the lines be down or not...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Even if they are down
 try and put this call...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What the hell are you doing?
 No, I don't mean you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Go sit there, please.
 - Let me talk to Rajiv...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I can't do that. Go and sit now.
 Sit her there and see that she does!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Stay here... No Madam, I'm back.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look Madam, have pity on me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I had told you, you won't get
 a line for 4 hours.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Is there any secluded place here?
 - Yes. - I want to be left alone.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And the moment the call
 comes through, call me. - Fine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}There's a problem...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, put me through. Kishorilal?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}How are you?
 No, I didn't phone you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Arjun is here and Rajiv is coming
 tomorrow. We're all fine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll just call her.
 Ganga, my dear...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Yes, Papa? - Your phone.
 - Who's calling?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- It's an important call. - From?
 - Guess. - Tell me, Papa.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Kishorilal uncle.
 - Really? Let me talk to him.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Uncle? This is Ganga here.
 My respects...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm fine. Oh uncle! How
 will I not remember you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And that song of yours...
 We all sing it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It's a super hit.
 Even Grandma sings it!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes? And how are you? Do you
 take your medicine on time?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Your Little Master
 is here. He's okay.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A bit pompous... No, uncle.
 He's nice.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Okay, I'll give it to him.
 - Yes, go on...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Everything's fine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- That soap in your room...
 - Keep it as I told you to.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This is...
 - Ganga.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And that one then... - A trick.
 - You may go.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I'm... My name is...
 - I know. You're Arjun.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv's friend. You have come
 to see me and my home.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm sorry.
 My entry was a bit mistimed.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}All good people admit their
 error, and apologize at once.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll say that all the good
 people in this world...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...forgive those, who apologize.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Your face shows that
 you've forgiven me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And your smile says that we
 must become friends soon.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And your hand says we must
 shake hands soon. Right?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- A firm friendship? - Yes.
 - Absolutely? - Sure.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Every relation in this house
 is bound with bond of love.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Whether it's with an animal, or
 between a servant and his master.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}To form new relationships
 we don't break old ones!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Do you have any shame, or not?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Forgot the rules set here? It seems
 he's not fixing your betrothal...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...but you're confirming his!
 - My dear...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Whatever Arjun's doing is
 for your own good.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Imagine that he's a film director.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Who is planning to get the hero
 and the heroine together.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv is coming tomorrow.
 In his honor, I've invited...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...the elite of the city.
 So don't do any mischief tomorrow.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Am I not here to break the
 legs that you're standing on!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}How will you? And why?
 As if you were never little.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You too must've been naughty then.
 Don't laugh! You'll grow old too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now everything is fine between
 us. We know each other...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I just wish to explain one thing.
 Think anything you like about me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv's servant, his "cutlery"...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}His friend, brother, anything!
 But there's one thing.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A boy like Rajiv is hard to find
 in this whole world, let alone U.S.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He's out of this world.
 ...he's mind blowing!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Today too, he'll come in a
 special car in such great style...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...our American Prince.
 - He's here. - Who?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Your dear prince from Delhi
 His car had a 4-tyre flat.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Is he coming in a chariot?
 So come and see that.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Welcome to India, son-in-law.
 Welcome to India.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}All the guests are here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Your father has invited so many
 people. Raju must be nervous.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Meet the Asst. Police Comm.
 Of our area, Mr. Yadav.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Bless you... it's all right.
 So...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- If you have a problem, call me.
 - What problem with you around, sir?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I mean if anyone is to be pulled up.
 I just jailed a minister, you see.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What goes on here?
 - Nothing. Come, have some snacks.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Pay your respects, son.
 Not mine, this gentleman's.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Bless you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Cool, sir. - Cool? You're
 feeling cold with a coat on?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- No. "Cool" means "fine, thanks".
 - Why thank?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- O, wifey... - Right here.
 - Come dear, let's go.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}In Punjab they hit you like this,
 and show their affection.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The chair, sir!
 Chair, sir, I say!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- He doesn't know Hindi you see.
 Say "Chair". - Go to hell!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Baba, someone has cast an evil
 eye on him. Ever since he's here...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...his health has been bad.
 Give him a remedy for it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He's just warding off evil
 spirits. Try to understand.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He too is having the same
 problem. So please... Just once...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No, no. I'm fine...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This is Love from India!
 - Shall we sit down?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How is he?
 - Shall I tell you the truth?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- He's like a prince!
 - Sweet.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Where's Ganga.
 - I'll just go and see.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What's wrong? Why the delay?
 Where's Ganga? - Getting ready.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Dressing up in finery...
 There she comes now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How am I looking?
 - Wonderful!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Didn't I say that when I get
 ready, you'll just gawk! - Sure.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Isn't she looking beautiful?
 - Sorry, but she resembles an ape!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Try to understand.
 Rajiv hates such heavy ornaments.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- He's American and likes simplicity.
 - But this is Indian simplicity.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No! I'll show you simplicity.
 Hold this, and you come with me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Take this off and why did you
 wear these gold ornaments?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What will you have? Tea, juice?
 - I'll prefer tea.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Will you have tea, too?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How much sugar?
 - Just one spoon.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Two more.
 - Two more? ...Two.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Okay, one more.
 - One more.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Do one thing, add the whole lot.
 - The whole lot?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You're pretty smart!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv... How did you like Ganga?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Let me sleep. My head is aching!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Okay then, shall I...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}consider her for myself?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You haven't told me how
 did you find Rajiv?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You didn't tell me either.
 - Did you like him, or not?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Liked him not. - Tell me.
 - You tell me. - No, you first.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Tell me... - You tell me.
 - Okay, I'll tell you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I think you didn't
 like Rajiv at all.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}When did I say that?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So! You like him, eh?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Dad, it's bad. Surajdev
 called everyone, but us.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He got scared you may not
 spoil his daughter's chances.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I don't spoil chances,
 I stop them.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And what if they get engaged?
 - Then? - We'll break it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Surajdev, let my good days
 come. Then I'll show you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Where are you going? - To give
 milk to Rajiv. - Give it here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Ganga, go give this to Rajiv.
 - Me? - Yes!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Take it, I said. Hurry up.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why her, and not me?
 - Arjun said...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...Ganga will give him
 the milk today.
This world is a bride,
and the jewel on the bride's forehead
This world is a bride,
and the jewel on the bride's forehead 
is this India of mine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}In our country a snake is not
 considered as an animal, but God.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You have your milk and sleep.
 Nothing will happen.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You?
 - I want to meet you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...in private.
 - Why in private?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Well, won't it be better if we
 chat a bit? - So let's chat.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Not here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Then where? - In those fields.
 Behind the wind-mill.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}May I ask my mother?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Can't you make your own decisions?
 - It's not that...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Just wait here. I'll just come.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Auntie, may I go in the
 fields with Rajiv?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}In the fields? Why ask
 me, you shameless girl!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ask your mother!
 Did you hear? Your Rajiv...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...wants to take Ganga in the
 fields, behind the wind-mill!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Who wants to take her there?
 - He came as a guest, mother...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and he wants to take the girl
 behind bushes right in front of us!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Sister! Will you shut up?
 - Okay, I'll shut up!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Let her go behind the wind-mill.
 It's very hot, isn't it?!!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Speak softly.
 - Why? I can't speak softly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Are we thieves? Girls do not
 roll in the hay before marriage!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}If you think it's proper, send her.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sending her to America! What
 are you doing there? Come...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Congratulations!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My dear brother, if you
 wanted to meet Ganga...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...why talk of the fields?
 - What's wrong with the fields?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look. In Indian etiquette,
 before marriage...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...there are various
 rules and norms.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A river, is no river without water.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Wind is no wind without sound
 to it. - That marriage...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...is no marriage
 without a love-story.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You do understand what
 I mean by that. - No.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, before Rajiv and
 Ganga get married...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...it's vital that they click!
 And they'll click...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...only when they chat. And they
 will chat, only when they meet.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why should we mind if they meet?
 - You don't mind...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...but yesterday, that scene which
 Auntie made about the fields...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm being frank. Rajiv is born in
 America. He'll just run away!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No, no. If you wish, tomorrow,
 we can take them out...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...on a sight seeing tour and
 show them the fort there. - Auntie...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why should I mind? My lips
 are sealed! - Hear that?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No, son. It'll be as you say.
 Shut up! Will you, my dear?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It will be as Arjun says.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Don't go too far from the
 hearts that are broken.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But don't go too near the ones
 that are beating together, either.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The one who drives a Mercedes
 is pedaling a cycle...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}See how in various ways
 he's wooing you! Too good!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But I'm no less either.
 You saw my artistry, didn't you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}How I convinced the elders,
 that we'll go on a picnic.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This will give you a
 chance to talk to Rajiv.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He loves you a lot.
 Sometimes I think...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...if he loves you so much now,
 how much he'll love you later! Mad!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What is it, Ganga?
 Why are you staring at me?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- May I ask you something?
 - Sure, go ahead.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I know that I haven't driven Rajiv
 mad, but your efforts have.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You are his friend,
 and brother too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But some kind of bond is forged
 between you and I also.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A bond of implicit trust
 and friendship. Right?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What do you want to say?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I want to ask you...
 Is Rajiv right for me?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}After so many days now,
 this kind of a question...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He has hidden something from me.
 Yesterday I was tidying his clothes.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And I found this.
 It's not that he smokes...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...but the fact that he hid it.
 If he has any more such vices...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...please tell me now.
 So that I can decide properly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, your advice can
 either make my life...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...or, ruin it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ganga, you're totally mistaken.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This packet is not Rajiv's.
 It's mine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Actually, sometimes, I do smoke.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But Rajiv... drinks and cigarettes...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- There must be a lighter with this.
 - I'd rather you not smoke either!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- A man looks so rotten.
 - Shall I leave it?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Leave it. - There!
 - You're very bad!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Am I still?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Secretly, Silently....
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Two hearts are meeting...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}but quietly, queitly...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Two hearts are meeting, but quietly, queitly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Everyone is noticing; 
yes, everyone is quietly noticing.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Two hearts are meeting, but quietly and secretly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Their breaths are unsteady;
they've stayed away nights on end.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sometimes when you fall in love, 
you aren't pleased by anything.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll just keep hold of my heart,
since I recognize that this is magic.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Quietly the magic is taking effect. 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}They sit so innocently,
as if there's nothing at all going on.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But everything is apparent 
to those around them.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is broad daylight, not the dark of night.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What is it, if it's nothing at all?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Their lips are silent, but...
silently their glances speak to each other.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Two hearts are meeting, but quietly and secretly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Everyone is noticing; 
yes, everyone is quietly noticing.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Two hearts are meeting, but quietly and secretly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Before flames burst into life,
smoke like this arises.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And it looks just like it does right here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What an ache awakes in the heart!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Both sides seem to feel it equally.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look from one to the other, silently. 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Two hearts are meeting, but quietly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Quietly, everyone is noticing.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Two hearts are meeting, but quietly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, Daddy. Rajiv has liked Ganga.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You're not saying anything, son.
 - Daddy...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...I think Ganga should go
 to the U.S. Before marriage.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- See the culture, the people there.
 - Right!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- It's the girl who will live abroad
 not the boy. - It'll be nice...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...if she comes with us to America
 for 1-2 months and sees everything.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm happy to see you
 speak so maturely.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I'll talk to her father.
 - What are you saying?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That we send her to America
 all alone? Are you alright?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What's wrong in that? He's a friend.
 Can't she go to my friend's house?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Indian girls do not go
 without marrying, son.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I too have decided that
 she will not go. - Correct.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Okay. Call the whole thing off.
 I'll speak to Kishorilal.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then what was the need for all this?
 Why did you call him all the way?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then what do we do?
 Become Americans?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come, Kishorilal.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}How can we send the girl without a
 betrothal or a confirmed relation?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Just think.
 We live in a small town.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What will people say?
 - They've already started gossiping.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And suppose she returns
 without marrying your son?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I've got a solution to it.
 - What?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We'll get Rajiv and Ganga
 engaged this week itself.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then she'll go with us,
 and after a month...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...we'll get them married in
 U.S.A. In style. Okay?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Okay? You shouldn't have
 any objection now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Why should we have any objection to
 an engagement? Right, my dear?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Say you agree. It's okay.
 - What I say is...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...you all come with us.
 - No, that's impossible.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It's our harvest season, you see.
 None of us can make it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}If none of us can make it
 my daughter can go instead.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}America? No, I can't.
 How can you suggest it?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, that'll be perfect.
 If you stay with Ganga...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...she won't feel lonely.
 - Go, Mom.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Okay. If you all insist, I'll go.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So it's all fixed now.
 Engagement on Monday.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then Ganga's "farewell" and on
 that note give us sweet-meats.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, it'll be a farewell, no doubt.
 Who knows when she will visit India?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What's this? You're
 sitting all alone here?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What's up? You're getting engaged
 and you're crying?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I know. You don't wish
 to leave Papa, do you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I don't want to go anywhere!
 - That is unavoidable, dear.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}All girls marry and
 go away one day.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Leaving their mother
 and father behind.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Forever and ever.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Why are you crying now?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You made me cry. - You did.
 - You made me cry. - You did!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come on. The engagement and the
 farewell are both on Monday.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- The cards will be sent today.
 - Cards? Must be Arjun's idea.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What! Kusum engaged to Rajiv?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Never! Did you hear that?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is absolutely unfair.
 The whole town knows...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...that Ganga was to marry my son.
 - Indeed.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He hasn't just insulted me,
 but this whole town!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- That's a lie! Uncle had not
 promised you anything. - Shut up!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Stop jumping, son. Will you?
 That foreigner is marrying Ganga.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv is no foreigner.
 He's the son of an Indian.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That bastard Kishorilal...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}First they broke the engagement,
 now they're breaking my son! Help!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No Rajiv, No. No, Arjun.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You will not fight. For my sake.
 - We'll have to decide Surajdev.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What do you mean? I'm her father.
 I'll give her away where I want to.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}How will you decide? Tell us.
 We'll decide today, right now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then come let's have a combat.
 The winner will take Ganga.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Agreed. Today, either you take
 her, or I will. - Good!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Even Lord Rama had to lift
 Lord Shiva's bow, to win Sita.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So today whoever wins,
 shall be Ganga's groom!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is too much! My daughter's
 future will be decided by bouts?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then admit you're a cheat, and
 that you sold yourself to a N.R.I.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Suraj is not a cheat,
 but you are!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And we'll give you
 an apt reply to it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Good thing the Headman
 mentioned about Ram-Sita.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My son's shoulder is willing
 to carry any bow you wish.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Tell me, which bow do you have?
 Let me see how strong your son is!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I'm ready, Daddy.
 - So Manuchand...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...what's your choice?
 Running, wrestling, boxing...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- "Kabbaddi"!
 - "Kabbaddi"?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Okay. Today and now!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What? A kabbaddi-match?
 - Yes.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And the winner will be sis's
 bridegroom! - Nonsense.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Go and see. Stop them.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No... It won't be possible.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Don't you worry, Suraj.
 We'll defeat them.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You'll say, take care of Ganga,
 and I'll say she's my daughter now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- So you have no right.
 - Right on.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Arjun hasn't come as yet.
 - He's not coming with us.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why? - He'll stay back a bit more.
 - Meaning?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Meaning... Here he comes.
 Ask him yourself.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- For Rajiv and you.
 - What's this? You're not coming?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've to go back to Mathura, where
 my father has an old house.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've to rebuild it as a music-school.
 So I'll have a lot of paper work.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You didn't tell me this earlier.
 - Didn't get a chance to.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Keep these. - What for? I'm going
 abroad for the first time.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I'll be so lonely. - Why?
 There is Daddy, Rajiv, your aunt...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And many others who'll take care.
 - But you won't be there.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You had said you'd be there
 with me. I agreed only because...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look. My responsibility,
 and work ends here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now your life and my life
 go different ways.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Okay?
 - Why are you saying that?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Because, now you've to become
 a responsible daughter-in-law.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Abroad, and live happily with
 everybody. - Don't give a sermon.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Hurry. Your plane will leave
 without you. - I can go alone.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I don't need your help.
 I can take care of myself.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Crazy kid!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Are you Arjun Sagar? - Yes.
 - A passenger's sent you this note.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Arjun, come soon.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And see that girl there?
 In a maroon dress.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That's Nita, my younger brother
 Sandy's wife. - Sandy?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sandip actually, but he became
 'Sandy' after coming here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is Katy...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Daddy has brought a lovely girl.
 - But she looks dominating.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why? Feeling scared?
 - I'm not scared of anyone.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sister, does everyone wear
 such clothes in this country?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sister! You called me sister?
 Do I look like a sister to you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My name is Padma, and people
 out here call me "Paddy".
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And this is your Auntie Nita.
 I had pointed out her to you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And he is my youngest
 brother, Sandy.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- May I go?
 - Yes.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Get lost! You rascal.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Don't you have any mother and sister
 that you kiss her publicly like this?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Is this a way to meet a girl?
 And you shameless girl...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...how can you be so intimate with
 these whites? Forgot family norms?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- She's still young... - Why are
 you firing her? She's ours now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come, my dear.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- That was quite a scene.
 - What can I say, Mr. Mitra.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Kishorilal went to India and
 got real shit for us!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ganga, my dear.
 Come and sit near me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Isn't she beautiful?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You haven't eaten anything since
 morning, and you must be famished!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Get some food for us, please.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Today I'll eat with her.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Bless you. What were you
 looking at? A new country?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It's either very quiet here,
 or it's most vociferous.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Man is either alone,
 or he's in a crowd.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Last night the party that
 was given in your honor...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The abhorrence that Nita showed you...
 I saw and heard, too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But my Aunt was at fault too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My dear. In the house of a
 benevolent man like Kishorilal...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...half are Indian, and
 half are westerners.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That's why, a pure soul like you
 will always be shown resentment.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And you'll have to endure it.
 That will be your acid test.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Mother says a woman is tested
 through out her life!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You've caught on.
 My blessings are with you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What are you whispering
 with my daughter, Sis?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, she is managing the
 household duties already.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No! She'll do nothing of the sort.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}She has to tour America and
 Canada as yet. Right, my dear?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Good news, my dear. Tomorrow, in
 honor of our new Ambassador...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...all the Indian VIPs of the
 city are being invited.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}They'll honor you and Rajiv, too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Hasn't Arjun come as yet?
 - He's a fool.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I don't know. Should come
 in a couple of days.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Indian!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}After this, we've to
 welcome one more person.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This welcome is of that Ganga
 who has come here for the 1st time.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The would-be daughter-in-law
 of Kishorilal, Miss Kusum Ganga...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...is India's Goddess of knowledge,
 a symbol of our culture.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll now request her to come here...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and sing some songs for us.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Your would-be daughter-in-law
 is very beautiful.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What shall I sing?
 - We'd all like to know...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...how you feel
 after coming abroad.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- But I don't know the full song.
 - Sing anyway.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Arjun! You're here?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Why did you take so long to come?
 I had such a difficult time.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Auntie had one of her scenes...
 - What are you doing?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is no time to chat.
 Everyone's looking. Go on.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- They want me to sing "India" song.
 - So sing. - You also sing with me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No, I can't sing with you.
 Daddy's getting angry. Go now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He's my second son.
 A nephew who's like a son.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- No, I can't. Daddy's angry. Go!
 - Okay, but I've lots to tell you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This world is a bride,
and the bindi on the bride's forehead...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}is this India of mine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}India, my homeland; India, my beloved.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This world is a bride,
and the bindi on the bride's forehead 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}is this India of mine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}India, my fate; India, my religion.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}India, my homeland; India, my beloved.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This is the city's biggest paper.
 - You too are the greatest prince.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Keep it safely.
 We'll have it framed later.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Are we going to Hollywood?
 - Tomorrow. - Who all are going?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- We all.
 - Neeta Auntie too?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Neeta Auntie's not going.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And Arjun?
 - He's not coming either.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yesterday I spoke to him, and,
 he said he can't make it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why not? - Ask him yourself.
 You know him well too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now hurry up and give me a kiss.
 I've to go to the office.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What delicious parathas!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Honestly, you won't find such
 parathas even in India.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Doesn't Arjun live in this house?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is the main house,
 not a servant quarter.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You mean Arjun is a servant here?
 - More or less. My brother-in-law...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...did quite a lot for him. He tends
 to our cars in our garage...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and runs a studio above it.
 - Here...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Then where does he eat?
 - In a hotel or some such place.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}When he comes here, we feed
 him, like we feed the poor.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}To hell with Arjun.
 Have this, else it'll get cold.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Krishna Ma has sent these
 especially for you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Will you do me a favor?
 - Yes.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Kusum Ganga has sent
 you this letter...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and the parathas for us!
 - Let me eat them...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and you read the letter.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It says..."Little Master Arjunji...
 Don't show your mastery..."
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}"Come with us quietly.
 Daddy's orders totally, and...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...swear on me honestly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- If someone wrote such
 things to me... - Honestly...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...Id go to hell with her!
 - Idiots!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- She's going to be Rajiv's wife.
 - Going-to-be... she isn't yet!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}See this!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What did you do with that paper?
 Lost it! Where?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I don't remember
 where I put it...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I wrapped parathas in it.
 - Parathas?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- For Arjun.
 - Really? Meaning...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...you wrapped up my respect
 along with those parathas too!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It's so obvious!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You said it this once...
 Don't ever repeat it!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Why don't you understand, that
 it was the only copy I had!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But it's original copy is with me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You didn't tell Rajiv, that when
 you sent me those parathas...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...you had sent me a letter,
 that I take this photograph...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and frame it beautifully.
 You do forget.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look. See how I've put it
 in a beautiful frame.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}See what Rajiv's doing?
 He's smoking a cigarette.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And you said he never smoked.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is America. We're in a disco.
 It's fashionable to smoke here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}90%% people here are smoking.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So Rajiv is from those 90%% .
 You lied to me, didn't you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What am I asking you?
 Who was she?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He's saying that the boy and
 the girl who win this contest...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...will have to give a number
 and if that matches their number...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...then they'll get
 the "Made in Heaven Award".
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why's that? - According to them,
 the couple made in this world...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...is not as great as the pair
 made in Heaven! - Good!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Shall we go to Rajiv?
 - Want to play? Come on...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Let's take part in the contest.
 - It's a kid's game, dear.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What will I do in it?
 Make Arjun your partner.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- No. I won't go with Arjun.
 - Why not?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}She won't go. And she shouldn't
 I'll dance with Kelly...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm willing to go with you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I can buy everything!
 Everything...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is a normal scene.
 He drinks and gets knocked out.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And Arjun takes him home.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How are you, dear?
 - Fine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Hows Rajiv?
 - Nice.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- And Arjun? - Very nice!
 - Are you happy abroad?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I don't know.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}There's everything... yet nothing.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've invited 1,000 guests...
 Book all the 5-star hotels.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The whites will never forget
 my son's marriage.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What are all these papers...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Don't you clean your master's room?
 - He doesn't allow anyone in.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What dirty magazines...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What are you looking at?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What... what's all this?
 - Oh that!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}She's Rajiv's girlfriend, Kelly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Kelly loved Rajiv, and he
 too loved her very much.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But he never mentioned this.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Is this something one mentions?
 Dear girl...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Girlfriends are a status symbol
 of the richie-rich!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Consider yourself lucky, that Kelly
 didn't get Rajiv, but you did.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The millionaire Kishorilal's
 daughter-in-law...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...will be you, not Kelly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}O Duerden doll, this is America...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv is an American, and you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...you'll have to stay
 with an American.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Kelly was your girlfriend, right?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Did you love her very much?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Even wanted to marry her?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Did you and Kelly...
 I mean...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...did you have a physical
 relationship with her.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}In America such relationships
 occur... they just happen.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Why make such a national
 issue out of it?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Kelly was my past, and,
 you are my present.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You won't believe it, but we were
 just talking about you. Honest.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Going to Australia, eh? Tonight?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Want to meet me, eh?
 Then come to my office...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...we'll go together for a dinner.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Kelly learnt Hindi when we
 were going around together.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It's essential that I go,
 else Kelly will be offended.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll be coming in late,
 so you better have your dinner.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I brought this...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I entered at the wrong time.
 Never mind, later may be.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Wait!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Everything's gone haywire.
 And it's all your fault!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You lied through your teeth!
 Rajiv's like this and that...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is Rajiv's true picture.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, all these
 small petty matters...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...you'll have to adjust
 yourself to them.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Small petty matters?
 Is this a small matter?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is a small petty
 matter in your view?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, I don't want jilted palaces!
 I just want some love from a man.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Understand? Small matter, indeed!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- But everybody here loves you.
 - No! And I don't want such love.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I don't!
 - What kind of love do you want?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ask yourself that! The kind
 of love you give others.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That's the kind of love I want!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Taking me to be some innocent photo,
 you've trapped me in a golden frame.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And you want me to hang
 on some wall quietly...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and become a part of
 this synthetic decor!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Had I come with this dream
 to this foreign land, Arjun?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, everything will be fine.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll talk to Rajiv myself
 tomorrow. But Ganga...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...you too will have to
 take things patiently.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll go now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You'll also not
 leave me, will you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- She's not that kind of a girl.
 - Then what kind of a girl is she?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, don't get me wrong.
 But girls from India...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...especially those from rural areas,
 they can't bear this cultural shock.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}If you want to change her, then
 go slow about it. After marriage...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look. You're my friend.
 And Ganga's my wife.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Let the friend stay a friend,
 And the wife, a wife.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And it'll be better if you don't
 interfere in our personal matters.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Your role as a friend ends
 here. Now let me play my role.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Whether you accept it or not.
 You've fallen in love.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- No! - Yes!
 - No! - Yes!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- No!
 - Yes!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- No? - Yes!
 - Well, you are, aren't you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I won't go to her house,
 nor will I meet her. Okay?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Okay. Let's see.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What! He'll never come here?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Even to meet me? Okay.
 Go tell him this.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}If he's not bothered about me,
 I don't care either!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Cares, my foot! If he really
 cared, he'd answer my calls.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Today's his birthday?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He doesn't want to meet anyone?
 Not even me?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll show him!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Arjun is not in. Don't know
 when he'll return.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}If any one calls,
 tell them I'm out.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I wish to be alone today.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So what if it's his birthday?
 He didn't invite me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He hasn't invited anyone.
 He's all alone and depressed.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So what shall I do about it?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, in America we leave people
 alone, if they wish it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But in India we never
 leave our friends alone.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}In fact, we gate-crash and wish
 our friends on such occasions.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This isn't India, but America!
 - But he's still your friend.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Have you forgotten his obligations?
 - He didn't oblige me, but Daddy.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He wants Daddy to take interest in
 a music company he wishes to launch.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Anyway, I've to attend a party,
 and... Look Ganga...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...you can go with Paul if you wish.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And... take some old gift lying
 around the house for him.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Have you understood now,
 what Rajiv wants?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Some day I will meet you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Some day I will meet you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love, from that day forth, 
you will be with me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But who knows when 
you'll shower down your love;
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}my heart is thirsty, my lonely heart! 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Just step out from the picture
in my mind and come before me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You're my fate; fight out of the picture
in my mind and come before me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Step out the picture in my mind 
and come before me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}"Life goes on"
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I don't even remember since when, 
perhaps as long as I've existed,
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I have loved you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm your poet, and you are my muse.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Lately, I'm restless with longing for you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've been restless with longing for you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}"Life goes on..."
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No matter who she is, just tell me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}At least show me this picture of her!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This story shouldn't be told to just everyone,
but you can't hide it from friends!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll cure the pain in your heart;
If I can't do anything, then I'll pray for you!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}She'll struggle out of the picture 
and come; you'll meet her,
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}your love!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Some day I will meet you...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love, from that day forth, you will be with me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But who knows when you'll shower your love upon me;
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}my heart is thirsty, my lonely heart! 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Just step out from the picture in my mind
and come before me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes...
 It's 11:30 p.m.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Everyone's waiting for you.
 - It's Arjun's birthday today.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Everyone's ridiculing you that
 you're dancing with those workers.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- But I've taken Rajiv's permission.
 - I'm asking you for the last time.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Are you coming home
 this minute, or not.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Auntie...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Just a minute. Talk to Arjun.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I couldn't make it, friend.
 Now send my Ganga back.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- She and Paul are just leaving.
 - And listen. Tomorrow...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...Im holding a party
 at the dockyard...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and you're attending it.
 - I won't be able to, Rajiv.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Oh come on. The problem is one
 of the musicians has run off.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}So in his place, you come
 with your guitar...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and sit in a corner
 and strum it...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Why did you hit him?
 - He went for her "chunni"...- So?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- It's embarrassing for her.
 - Isn't it my job to protect her?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Whose wife is she going to be?
 Mine or yours?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You small fries shouldn't be
 invited at all. Auntie was right.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Go! Go!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A storm never warns before it hits.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It just comes, ruins
 everybody, and goes away.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What are you hinting at?
 - Fire and wax...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...have a star-crossed
 relationship. We just know...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...that they emit light together.
 But we don't realize this...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...that under that fire, the
 wax is slowly melting away.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come straight to the point.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The intimacy between
 Arjun and Ganga is...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Enough! You had your say today, but
 don't give it a thought hereafter.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Whatever's to be done,
 leave it to me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Did you call me, Daddy?
 - Yes, Arjun.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I've some good news for you.
 - Good news?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You've been chosen as the President
 of Norse Engineers Auto Co.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You'll also have its
 major share holdings.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now you'll have your
 own bungalow, a car...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You like my car very much, right?
 Here, take these.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}From today the car is yours.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You seem very happy today.
 What's the matter?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm happy, and I'm sad too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sad because you'll have to leave
 this city tomorrow itself.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv will get married on the 9th.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Be present here on the 9th morning.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That means I'll have to
 leave tomorrow morning.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes. Tomorrow morning at 5 a.m.!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Tomorrow morning...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Can't I leave after 2 days?
 - No.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It concerns your career, and you
 have your first Board meeting.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You'll have to go.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Bless you. Now you too select
 a nice girl and settle down.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll go now, Dad.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Call Arjun on the line.
 I'm Ganga speaking.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Arjun has gone.
 - Where to?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}That I don't know. But I do
 know that he has left us!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This morning, when we were all
 sleeping, he just left.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, Papa. This is Kusum Ganga.
 You phoned after ages.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Hows mother? And the boys?
 And Duksha-Sonali?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm fine.
 He has gone out.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Everybody's gone out.
 I'm alone here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'm alright.
 And happy too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No... I'm very happy.
 Why do you ask again and again?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes? My voice?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It's because of the ice-cream.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Aren't you coming to U.S.A.?
 Please come, Papa...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I can't hear...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Can't hear...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No, my dear.
 Don't cry so.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You had an engagement ring...
 Where is it?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Engagement ring? Where is it?
 Where did I keep it?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll tell you.
 Since yesterday evening...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...it was lying by the pool.
 And now...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...it's in my hand.
 Hence, put it on.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Take this. Put it on.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've brought you from India.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You are hope to your parents.
 And, future to us.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You are Rajiv's life
 in the years ahead.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I know my son is
 a difficult person.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But by getting to know
 his American ways and habits...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...change them to your liking.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Promise! Isn't that what
 we had promised each other?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Hadn't we?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've to go to Las Vegas
 with my friends for a wedding.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then go! Take her with you too.
 And show her the town.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Of course, my foot! First apologize
 to her. Say sorry.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}See?
 How soft hearted my son is!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now go do your packing,
 and get into a happy mood...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and go to Las Vegas.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Kishorilalji...
 What's this Las Vegas like?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It's a town full of good-time,
 and vices, from song-dance...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...gambling, marriages, honey-moon.
 All sorts of fun and frolic.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Are they meant only for kids?
 - No. Adults also go there.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But not with children!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}When will we go there?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I meant you, me, Krishnama,
 and other family members?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll also be taking you all.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Really?
 - To the temple!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You mean Arjun left the city?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Before a fire breaks out,
 there's always smoke...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This air there is like
 the scene here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This heart...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This insane heart
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}this heart is insane,
and it has made me crazy too!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I left her city behind;
she broke my heart in her lane there.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Even so, my heart still pounds in my chest.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I threw her out of my heart,
I did what I shouldn't have,
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}but even so, her memory 
still drives this heart...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}crazy, this heart,
this heart is crazy!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What's even wrong with my heart?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What complaint do I have against it?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What has my heart ever done to me, 
apart from fall in love?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My heart's a lover, not some thief; 
what am I to do?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I have no control over my heart; 
what am I to do?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My heart's a lover, not some thief; 
what am I to do?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I have no control over my heart; 
what am I to do?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This insane heart;
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}this heart is crazy!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}How merciless the heart is!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}She's an image burnt into my heart.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I say, rip it; I say, it's a chain holding me down!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But it's not a thread to be so easily snapped; 
what am I to do?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I have no control over my heart; 
what am I to do?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But it's not a thread to be so easily snapped; 
what am I to do?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I have no control over my heart; 
what am I to do?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This insane heart;
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}this heart is crazy!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Crazy heart!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The crazy girl has made me crazy too!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What are you doing? - I'm playing
 with this romantic city of lights.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I'm teaching you how to make love.
 - I don't want to learn.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Now go to your room please
 - Look, you'll have to learn that.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Every wife has to, else
 the husband gets offended.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look, I'm not your wife.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- There are still a few days left
 for our wedding. - So what?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We'll get married right now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}There! We're married.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I beg you. Please go to your room.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}All my western friends, with
 their girl friends...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...are enjoying life
 behind closed doors.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Try to understand. They are
 westerners. And we're Indians.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Our culture forbids boys and girls
 doing such things before marriage.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We're also going
 to get married soon.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then wait for a few days.
 Let's take our vows at least.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Let me become your wife...
 - Vows! Vows!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Leave me...
 Don't touch me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}There is nobody as hypocritical
 and you Indians,
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Mention sex, and you start
 whining and crying!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The two sexes are kept separate;
 women have their own society.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Men have their own. Yet you have
 a world record in population!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You, your parents, and
 other family members...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...are all illiterate villagers...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Want to hear more? Your India
 too, is no better than shit!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It stinks like cow-dung!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You fiend!
 You abuse our India! Well, listen!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}From today, I'm breaking off
 this relation with you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I discard this ring,
 a fraud symbol of our bond...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We consider you, your wealth and
 your drug-infested America...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...unworthy of holding
 a candle to India.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now go away from here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You struck me!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rajiv... don't touch me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How did she disappear, damn it!
 - I told you, I don't know.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}She wasn't there in the morning,
 I don't know where she went.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Phone the police commissioner, and
 take an urgent appointment for me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Come with me, Sandy.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You better find our girl. Else
 her father will raise hell here!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This truck driver says,
 he left some Indian girl...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...at the Waterfront Rly. Station.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ganga! What happened?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Don't cry, please.
 Listen to me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What happened? Tell me...
 Why did you do this?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You ran away all alone?
 Tell me, what's the matter?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Stop crying and tell
 me what happened?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Who did this to you?
 - Rajiv.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Okay. Let's go.
 Don't cry. We'll go home.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- No! I don't want to!
 - Listen... - No!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Didn't you hear me? I don't want
 to marry, nor stay in America.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I don't want to stay here,
 - Okay, we won't stay here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- But we'll meet Daddy at least.
 - No! Go ahead, if you wish.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll die, but I won't go back!
 I've taken a vow!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Shut up! Stop this madness, and
 let's go. - You'll send me to India.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Now! This moment!
 - Okay, I'll take you back.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is a foreign place.
 Meet Dad, just once
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Don't take me back if you wish.
 I'll go alone.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I don't need you!
 I can do without you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No! I'll go on my own.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I told you this was foreign land.
 Let's go from here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No! You are lying!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It's true. My friend saw them
 boarding a plane for Delhi.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This cannot be!
 - Be bold enough to face the truth.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The truth is that Arjun has taken...
 Ganga to India!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No! No!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Give me a call to America.
 The number is...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You will not phone them.
 You will never phone them.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We are dead to them, and they
 are dead to us! That is it
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sis! Wake up!
 I'm Dabboo. Wake up.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've been betrayed!
 I'll not keep quiet.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}We'll leave for India tonight!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ganga will have to return! She's
 mine and will always be mine!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You wolf in sheep's clothing!
 Now I know what your game is!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What's my game?
 - You lured her into your arms...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...and betrayed my friend and
 you lied about Rajiv.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No! What are you doing!
 Slashing the very person who...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Get aside!
 Why didn't you die there?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I had seen you off in bridal finery.
 I wish you had returned in a shroud!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}At least you wouldn't have returned
 with shame with this rascal!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What do you think you're doing?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You'll not hit Ganga!
 - I'll kill her!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My blood will flow before hers.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And it too will say,
 Ganga is as pure us the Ganges.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll go. Now. This very moment.
 Never to return.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But you'll not lift
 your hand to hit her.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}For God's sake, please go.
 Else, it'll be disastrous.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- No! No! Arjun is innocent
 - Shut up!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I don't believe a word you say.
 You have let me down!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Betrayed us very badly.
 Our self-respect has gone to dogs!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Die! Die, damn you!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll really and truly die!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Stop him, Papa.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Rs. 50 only,
 It fulfills all your wishes.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- When is the Mathura bus due?
 - It's gone.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- How long ago? - One hour.
 - When is the next one? - Evening.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- At what time?
 - 6.30 p.m.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Where are you from?
 - Nowhere!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look all of you,
 try to understand me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}There's nothing between
 Arjun and me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}These are all lies!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Then change those lies
 into Truth, Sis.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, Sis. We all agree on this.
 Only Arjun loves you truly.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Not Rajiv.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Remember?
 Once you had said...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Sing the song which is fragrant
 with this soil. Arjun has that.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You realized that later, but
 we all knew it from the beginning.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What are you all advising her
 on the sly? Get lost from here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Granny, we just... - Go away!
 Else your Dad will kill you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Eat a few morsels, my dear.
 You've not eaten for hours.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No, Granny.
 I won't eat anything.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Your father and mother...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...have shut you in because
 their own eyes are shut!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}But this old woman's eyes,
 are still wide open at this age!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I agree with what Daksha
 and Sonali have said.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Granny! - My dear, Arjun
 is a God-sent boon.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And such blessings are not
 to be let go, so easily.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Go; stop him. I'm practicing
 what I'm preaching.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Everything has been done
 to help you escape from here.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Look. There are your helpers.
 To help you escape from this jail.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}They're all ready. Where's Ramu?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Mother. Rajiv is in India.
 - I see.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Where's Suraj? - He has gone to
 collect Kulwanti and Kishorilal.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What! Is that man coming here too?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What will we tell them?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}O God, O God,
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This love is a form of worship, just as
worship is a form of love.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is insanity, just as that is.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This is my heart's desire, just as that is.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What has happened to me? Everyone is astounded.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Love has happened to me...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It shouldn't have happened...

{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...but it did happen
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I have fallen in love...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It shouldn't have happened...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}but it did happen.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I have fallen in love...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The world doesn't understand hearts, and
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}this heart doesn't heed the world at all.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Nothing else but love 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}recognizes the importance of a lover's glance...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Stop right there.
 And go back home.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I will. But tell me just once...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...that you don't love me.
 - No.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- I don't love you.
 - But you do!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- This is not proper.
 - Then say that.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Why do you say
 you don't love me?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}No! I don't love you at all.
 Understand?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now go back home. Go!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Now the time of decision has neared.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What decisions shall I make? 
The heart has spoken it,
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}the heart has spoken it:
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}If you prefer to live, prepare yourself to die.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've fallen in love...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It shouldn't have happened...
but it did happen.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I've fallen in love...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I sent my wedding clothes back to my father;
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Instead, I have wrapped myself in love,
instead of the veil of marriage
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I threw a ring representing 
false customs into the alley.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I broke all restraints of modesty 
and cast off all obligations.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Even if at every step I stumble, 
I will go, eyes closed, unafraid.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Ahead lies my beloved's home; 
behind remains the world. 
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I come with the prayer that 
I will be united with my lost love
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}My love, my worship, may I find him!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I dyed my scarf red with the blood of my heart
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}This union shall happen; 
the Ganges will meet the sea.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The Ganges will meet the sea...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Why did you bring him here?
It shouldn't have happened...
...but it did happen
I've fallen in love...
It shouldn't have happened...
...but it did happen.
I've fallen in love...
It shouldn't have happened...
...but it did happen.
I've fallen in love...
My love...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}The bullet which will leave the
 pistol I have in my pocket...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...will either target you, or me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I trusted you.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...gave you everything.
 Tell me the truth now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}What is the truth? Tell me.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Truth? You don't want
 to know the truth.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Because those who want to know it,
 don't carry a pistol...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...in their pocket, and,
 hatred in their hearts.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}It takes a big heart.
 One needs a big heart...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...to hear the truth.
 And the truth is...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}When a man gains status
 with wealth and power...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...he distances himself
 from truth and moral.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He thinks, whatever he
 thinks is the truth.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Whatever he did, was right.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And that's what has happened
 with you too, sir.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You made it big alright, but
 remained small in personal matters.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Because the truth is, that
 you lied to yourself.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You lied that an Indian girl can
 be a wife to a foreigner like him.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And to turn this lie into truth,
 you made me lie too.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And I, suppressed under your
 obligations, lied through my teeth.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Lied that Rajiv is very nice.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A very nice boy without
 any vices whatsoever.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}He's a son of a great,
 millionaire Indian.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A son of a wealthy man.
 A son... yes!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}A son, sir. But not an Indian.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And the truth is,
 I always lied to Ganga.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- What is your relationship
 with Ganga? - Trust.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Respect, reverence, and... Love.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}If protecting her, adds
 up to love, then, yes!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes! Yes! I love her.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And I always will. But I never
 tried to woo her for myself.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}And neither will I do it now.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Because Ganga is yours.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Her father's.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Mother's.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I'll go now, sir.
 And I'll never come back.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You heard the truth from Arjun.
 Now hear me also.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Want to see, Daddy, what
 your son wanted to do...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...in a drunken state,
 at the Las Vegas hotel...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...behind bolted doors with me?
 Then see this.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I ask you, what kind of
 a culture is this...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...where a would-be husband,
 behaves like this with his fiancée?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Even then, if you ask me
 to throw myself in this fire...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...then I'll do it, Papa.
 Because you are my father.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Decider of my fate. If you
 ask me to take poison...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...Ill take it!
 - Why should you?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}For centuries now, we women
 have been taking poison only.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}First we listen to our parents,
 then the husband, and finally, kids!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- You'll not take any poison!
 - Don't interfere, mother.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Keep quiet! You've lost your senses!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You've humiliated this poor girl.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Didn't you sing, "India is my
 country and religion"?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}You wished to nestle an Indian
 girl, India itself... in America?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Is this what you achieved?
 Wonderful!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}I ask you, if a girl from here
 goes to another land...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...where she has nothing in common,
 why should she go there?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Ganga will go abroad!
 - You're still saying that?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes! I'm still saying it.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Remember me saying, "One day,
 I'd make her my son's wife?"
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}From this house, to that one?
 By asking you for her hand...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}With folded hands?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}She'll become my daughter-in-law.
 Alright. But as the wife of...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}...not Rajiv, but Arjun.
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Yes, she'll marry Arjun!
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Your mother is right.
 If a girl from here...
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}- Goes to another land...
 - What are you doing, Dad?
{F:Verdana}{S:14}{C:$FFFFFF}Get lost from here.
