All is here for the vacancy
to the quality department.
Have yöu worked somewhere earlier?
Do yöu want to hear a joke?
Once a man was
drowning in the river.
He yelled,
"Lord Ganesha, please save me!"
Lord Ganesha started dancing.
The man asked,
"Why are yöu dancing?"
So, Lord Ganesha said, "Didn't yöu
dance while immersing me in water?"
Actually, I shouldn't be cracking
jokes about God in front of God.
I'm sorry.
Don't mind, but I have no mind.
Give my ball.
Hurry up! Quick.
Kids, are yöu okay?
Hey, mister!
Hello. Yes, yöu.
Aren't there enough
potholes in the city..
that yöu've dug up another one?
And for the past two weeks.
Those kids and my
God were saved today.
Why are yöu so irresponsible?
The next time,
someone might lose his life...
...because of these potholes.
But whether someone lives or dies...
...it doesn't matter to yöu.
Don't worry, madam.
yöu'll have no complaints
against us henceforth.
Okay.
Let's see.
Hi!
I just wanted to send
this message across that...
...I'm proud of yöu.
I'm sure that whatever yöu
do in life will be right for yöu.
No matter how many
obstacles yöu face...
...there won't be darkness anymore.
Hello.
Do yöu want to listen to the
bad news first or the worst news?
The bad news is that yöu'll
have to live without me every day...
...between 9 to 5 from now on.
And the worst news
is that I won't be able...
...to live without yöu
every day between 9 to 5.
I got the job, Aisha.
I got the job.
Now go and erase that
wish from yöur diary.
I've become independent.
Guru...
...there's something
that I have to say to yöu.
Tell me.
No, come home first.
Tell me. I'm on my way home.
No, come home.
Hello.
How did yöu get in?
Aisha?
What are yöu doing?
Who is
Does anyone barge into someone's house
like that without ringing the bell!
Get out of here. Get out!
Aisha, who is it? What happened?
Aisha!
Aisha, who is it?
Aisha, listen to me! Police!
Aisha! Listen! Hey! - Guru!
Listen, yöu've enmity with me.
Look.. spare her.
yöu have a problem with me.
Listen. Spare her.
Guru!
- Hey, stop. Let my Aisha go!
Please! No!
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me. Please.
Who is in charge of this area?
I am. Inspector Waghle.
Aditya Rathore, CBI.
But why is the CBI so keen
on the murder of an ordinary girl?
lam keen not on this girl,
but her love.
I didn't get yöu.
We'll have to find Aisha's
murderer at the earliest.
If he sets out to look for him...
...then the government will
have to find some new property.
Guru will kill so many...
...that there won't be enough
place to cremate the bodies.
'Devil. Monster. Demon. Beast.'
'Who says that only
God has several names?'
'Demons are found in hell.'
'But I met one such demon
in the so-called paradise in Goa.'
'But demons possess
a special quality.'
'It's his habit to be
present at his own funeral.'
'Hatred is his weapon.'
'Anger is his explosive.'
'He doesn't know
what sympathy means.'
'No one loves him.'
'Every love story has a hero...'
...a heroine...'
'...and a villain.'
'But this love story
is of a villain.'
Please forgive me, Guru.
I made a mistake, Guru.
What are yöu doing?
Guru, please forgive me.
I beg of yöu, Gurul Please spare me.
I beg of yöu. Don't do this!
For God's sake, spare me life.
Are yöu Pfﬂymg?
Guru, please forgive me.
Do yöu really think that
He will appear to save yöu?
Fine.
Pray.
No! Guru.
yöu have time until
this matchstick is put out.
Remember yöur God.
Rohan
What are yöu doing? What happened?
What are yöu doing, son?
Rohan.
Rohan.
Mother, I'll kill him!
- Don't do this!
Please stop.
CBI People beat me up a lot.
Raghu. Please save me, o God.
Rahull Rahul, no.
Help.
Can I give yöu a suggestion?
Don't pray to God.
Pray to the breeze.
Because if there's breeze,
yöu'll be finished.
No, no! Guru, please...
I made a mistake.
No, no! Guru, what are yöu doing?
Guru, please don't do this!
I beg of yöu!
No, Guru! Guru...
No, Rohan.
- No, leave me.
Guru!
Spare me, Guru.
Guru! Guru! No.
Guru! Spare me, Guru.
Spare me. Guru.
Let go of me!
- Let go off.
Guru, no.
Let go of me! Guru, let go of me!
Please let go of me!
Fine. I'll let go of yöu!
Brother.
No! No!
No!
No!
Come out.
Come on! Take him out.
Will yöu kill him? Leave.
Come on.
Tell me! Who is yöur boss!
Who do yöu work for!
Has Singh sir sent yöu?
Torture him.
Tell me about his business.
Hold him light.
All of yöu will be punished.
Hey, tell me.
Come on.
Ready, steady, smile!
Okay. A joke.
A woman went to the police
station and asked the inspector...
"Inspector,
my husband had gone to the market..."
"...to buy okra two days ago."
"He hasn't come back yet."
The inspector said,
"What's the big deal, madam?"
"Cook some other vegetable."
Wonderful! - Thank yöu.
Hey, come on.
What is the press doing outside?
So that yöur photos are
published in the newspaper...
...and people come to know
that yöu are the officer...
...who forbade an adult girl from
getting married against her will.
yöu're interfering in other people's
lives! Don't yöu have any shame?
Sheela is an adult.
And she came to me for help.
All of yöu treat her like a maid...
...who is only supposed
to do the household chores...
...and look after children.
When she demands to be happy...
...all of yöu have a problem with it.
While trying to belong
to a particular religion...
...yöu have forgotten
to be a human being.
Get aside. Move move.
Out. out from here.
Sharad, drive her out.
Because of yöur boss Caesar,
three officers of mine were killed.
The officers that
were doing their duty.
But I give yöu a chance.
I will make yöu my pet dog.
I will ask Deepu's
mother to testify...
...that her son accidentally
fell in the fire in a drunken state.
And being my pet dog...
...yöu will wag yöur tail
and take me to yöur boss Caesar.
It's yöur decision now.
yöu changed sides, didn't yöu?
She didn't testify against me.
That's the reason
why yöu're barking!
Will yöu speak up?
I will avenge Caesar for
killing my men at any cost.
I will make yöur condition
so miserable in prison...
...that yöu'll yearn for death.
People fear death.
But I face death each day.
As an uninvited guest.
Acting over smart.
yöu'll pay the price
for this insanity, Guru.
This is not insanity. It's manhood.
Lawyer, give the bail paper quickly.
Arjun.
ls everything alright?
Hey, listen!
Hey! Do yöu want to hear a joke?
Once a thief got
into a house to steal.
The safe read, "There is
no need to break open this safe."
"Press 1,2,3 and then the red button."
"The safe will open."
As soon as the thief
pressed the button...
...the alarm rang and
the police came there.
While leaving,
the thief told the owner...
"l have lost faith
in humanity today."
Hey!
The joke was not that bad.
yöu could have at least smiled.
Listen. I need yöu
to do something for me.
yöu don't have to rob a safe.
Someone needs to be kidnapped.
Will yöu do it?
I'm not asking yöu
to do it for free.
I'll pay yöu-
Show me yöur rate card.
I would have done it myself.
But just as we go
to a saloon to shave...
...and to a tailor
to get clothes stitched...
...similarly, won't we go
to a goon to get someone kidnapped?
Because yöu look like a villain.
Hey, villain!
Smile!
Come on.
Sahiba! Guru!
Wait. wait.
Pass the ball. Quick.
I sent yöu there to kill.
Not to get killed.
I know that yöu're
not too fond of living.
But yöur life is priceless for me.
Priceless.
God blessed me with yöu.
yöu're my son.
yöu mean more than a son to me.
Stop looking for excuses to die.
Look for a reason to live.
Caesar.
Caesar.
Caesar.
I know him.
yöu're too much.
Don't yöu understand?
Hey!
How many times do I tell yöu?
Hey, villain!
Madam, yöu can't go in.
I know him. Let me go.
Hey, villain!
Yes! See, I told yöu I know him.
Hi!
As all of yöu already know...
...Mr. Caesar has done
a lot for the people.
Villain!
I'll scream even louder
if yöu don't come here.
Hey! Come here!
Yes. See, he's coming.
I told yöu...
Let go of my hand!
Why are yöu holding my hand?
yöu have no idea
what I can do to yöu.
It won't take me too
long to dispose yöur body.
Slop following me and leave.
Wow!
This is why I want to hire yöu.
I know yöu're not the romantic kind.
yöu're the kind that
would shoot someone on sight.
Get lost!
I'm sorry. Cool it.
Listen. yöu'll kill me...
...and unnecessarily and
go to prison free of cost.
The way I'm paying yöu,
if someone had paid yöu...
...to kill me, then it was worth it.
But who would pay to kill me?
I'm so cute.
Do yöu suffer from
a talking disorder?
I suffer from a lot of disorders.
Forget about that.
Tell me. Will yöu do it for me?
Please say yes.
Never refuse money.
We're going on such
an important mission...
...but we don't even
know each other's names.
I'm Aisha.
Guru.
Why are yöu so rude?
Just as it's compulsory
for Superman to wear...
...red underwear over his costume...
...is it compulsory
for gangsters to be rude?
yöu don't laugh or smile.
yöu don't even shave or bathe.
I know what yöu are.
Angry bird.
The game is inspired by yöu. Yes.
Like this
Are yöu crazy or the one
who has to be kidnapped is crazy?
I'm not crazy.
It's Chhotu who's crazy,
just like a depressed lover.
That's why his family
got him admitted here.
They left him alone
and are settled in America.
Do yöu know what
they told the doctor?
That he's insane.
If I don't help him,
then he'll really go insane.
That's why...
We'll have to save him.
These are coins.
- Yes.
Do yöu want to hear a joke?
Let it be.
- Once... - I'll take the coins.
By the way,
yöu'll have to fight a few people.
yöu might get hurt.
If it was dancing,
I would have gone to a dancer.
But it's action.
That's why I had to come to yöu.
Because yöu are a villain!
Hey! Stop!
I'm stuck up here.
Each day should be like that.
This is fun.
Sometimes the players win,
and sometimes they lose.
But the dealer is always profiting.
Who are yöu?
I'm yöur father by relation.
My name is Shehanshah.
Shehanshah.
Where's Chhotu?
Where's Chhotu?
Chhotu, come with me.
Come on, Chhotu.
Chhotu!
- Aisha! Aisha! Aisha!
yöu're getting married, Chhotu!
Really?
- Yes!
Chhotu is going to get married.
Chhotu is going to get married.

Uniting two lovers.
Aren't there any wishes for her?
There are. Of course.
But all her wishes are really weird.
Seeing a peacock dancing
in the first rain.
To fly like a wind.
Flying like the wind.
Catching a butterfly
and playing with it.
Touching the snow.
Being famous for a day so
that people know who this girl is.
Seeing the world under the sea.
It gets serious now.
And that is, to save someone's life.
Saving someone's life.
Guru, saving someone's life.
Uncle, carefully.
We're going to the graveyard.
She directly went to
the hospital from church.
Thank yöu, Guru.
For the coins that I gave yöu...
...yöu did much more for
Sheela and Chhotu than that.
No matter how yöu look...
...yöu're not such a bad villain
as yöu try to show the world.
yöu have some good qualities.
Much more than the bad qualities.
I'm not good! I'm very bad!
What do yöu think of yöurself?
Do yöu think we live lo fulfill
yöur wishes in yöur diary? - No.
yöu click everyone's pictures...
...to show that yöu're
a very nice person?
No.
What do yöu try to prove
by cracking jokes every time?
Look at that. Look at death.
Do yöu want to make fun of it?
Crack a joke on it! Come on!
Life is playing the
biggest prank on me.
The biggest joke is that
death is laughing at me.
Yes, Guru.
I'm going to die.
These wishes that I want
to fulfill are my last wishes.
I don't even know if I'll be able
to fulfill all of them before dying.
I just...
...want to live my life
like such a party that...
...when death arrives...
...l want to sit and have a couple
of drinks with it before leaving.
It was very unfortunate, wasn't it?
But if yöu befriend the devil...
...it's bound to knock
on yöur door someday.
yöur Caesar killed yöur Aisha.
But what will yöu do now?
How will yöu kill Caesar?
No. Let it be.
yöu won't be able to do it.
The one who taught yöu to shoot...
yöu will never kill him.
Let me do a favour on yöu.
I'll kill him.
I'll take yöur revenge.
I'll find him.
No matter where he is.
Where were yöu?
I called yöu so many times.
I even left a message.
Who were yöu having fun with?
Tell me.
It was dead.
My phone's battery.
yöur phone's battery was dead.
But yöu were alive, weren't yöu?
yöu could have called
from a public phone...
...and informed that yöu'd be late.
But no. yöu will never change.
It's no use telling yöu anything.
- Listen.
Look,
I've brought a chain for yöu.
It'll look pretty on yöu.
Look at this. yöu brought
bangles for me last week.
They've tumed black
in just one week.
I had gone to aunt Madhvi's
house for a wedding.
I was flaunting these to everyone
saying that these are gold bangles.
But then I realised that
it's not gold, but brass.
It's brass coated with fake gold!
Here are yöur bangles.
yöu wear these bangles!
yöu and those bangles,
both are a fake!
I just don't want to talk to yöu.
yöu will not stay
in this house today.
Get out of my house!
Just get out!
Listen to me...
- I said get out!
Sulu!
I really don't know how he was born.
Get out of my house.
- Sulu, listen to me.
Take this. come on.
Listen to me... - Get out!
Sum.
Get out of here!
Listen to me.
Father.
Take this.
Don't feel bad about
what yöur mother said.
She loves yöur father a lot.
To be honest, men like yöu are giving
the men of India a tough time.
If there are any more men like yöu...
...then men will lose our manhood.
Take this.
Darling. Come here.
Where's the ice!
I forgot to get it.
Get it now!
Look, Rakesh,
we are middleclass people.
We're sandwiched between
the upper-class and the lower-class.
The police torture us.
The ministers torture us.
The people torture us too.
Our lives are too stressed.
How do we get rid of it?
That's why men like us
come home and beat our wives.
There's no other way to vent
out our frustration, my brother.
I have another solution
to yöur problem.
Come to Mira Road with me.
There are beautiful dancers
in the dance bars over there.
Be an animal!
Bring out the beast in yöu!
Hunt!
Hi!
'I just wanted to send
this message across that...'

Put the pistol down!
Guru, today I learnt that
the value of dogs is known...
...only after a lion arrives.
Why did yöu kill her?
What? What did yöu say, Guru?
How could yöu even think...
...that the one who raised yöu
like a father and gave yöu life...
...would take away yöur
reason to live from yöu?
But if yöu still feel
that I've killed yöur Aisha...
...then take this gun.
Take it!
And shoot me!
Fire all the bullets in it at me!
Why did yöu kill her?
Shoot me!
Shoot me now!
Shoot me!
Don't fear. Shoot me!
Guru.
Don't let this fire
in yöu douse, Guru!
Burn the world with this lava!
Then come back here!
To me!
Because a lion deserves
to be in the forest!
yöu are a lion! My lion!
yöu are an idiot!
yöu're completely useless.
Oh, God! Rakesh Mahadkar,
what do I do with yöu?
What is all this nonsense!
Madam.
- Brijesh!
I've made a lot of
money in the illegal deal.
I've brought yöur share honestly.
yöu're very naughty.
Why don't yöu explain
to yöur friend?
yöu're so active,
while he's the laziest.
He comes and asks
me what his chances are...
...for being the
employee of the month.
The Xerox machine in this
office works more than yöu.
The Xerox machine!
Really, yöu are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.
yöu don't have that talent.
Madam, he is a 2 rupee man.
It's true.
The Xerox machine in this office works
more than yöu. The Xerox machine!
Really, yöu are not worthy
of earning even 2 rupees.
Where are yöu lost?
Have yöu come here to repair
the phone or waste yöur time?
Lazy man!
That's why people don't have telephones
in their homes these days.
yöur service is so bad.
When we call yöu, yöu don't come.
And when yöu come, yöu don't
even provide proper service.
Look, I'm warning
yöu for the last time.
If my phone doesn't work, then
I'll just get the connection cut.
Then I won't have to
tolerate lazy people like yöu.
And...
What are yöu doing?
Where are yöu going?
Have yöu come to
repair the phone or...
Madam.
Don't worry.
yöu'll have no complaints
against us henceforth.
'yöu shouldn't have yelled at me.'
Everyone makes fun of me.
They call me lazy.
They call me a beggar.
They abuse me.
'My friend Brijesh is right.'
'We're middleclass people...'
'...who are sandwiched between
the upper and the lower.'
'The world tortures us.'
'The system tortures us.'
And when we go home,
our wives torture us too.
Today I don't want yöu in the house.
Get out.
I said out.
Sometimes I feel like killing her.
But I can never
raise my hand at her.
I love my wife a lot.
'My Sulo.'
'Sulochana.'
'Sulo is her pet name.'
'She means the world to me.'
'She means everything to me.'
Creep! Who the hell
do yöu think yöu are!
Oh, I know who yöu are!
A bloody little pig!
- 'yöu know...
Frustrated pervert!
- yöu know what?
I've never even looked
at another woman but her.'
'Why should I?'
'My Sulo is so beautiful.'
- Look at his face!
'She could have found anyone.'
'But she chose me.'
What? Who are yöu?
Telephone maintenance.
I need to check yöur phone.
It'll be done in no time.
Fine. Over there.
She has all the right to yell at me.
Yes, I do feel very angry.
And instead of her,
when I kill other women like yöu...
...l feel much better.
'As all of yöu die...'
'...I get rid of all
my worries and stress.'
'yöur pain doesn't make me happy.'
'It satisfies me.'
By killing yöu,
...l keep my love alive.
And Hake a gift for
my Sulo from every corpse.
'Usually,
a person is born ordinary.'
'He lives an ordinary life.'
'He dies ordinarily.'
'If not on the big
screen or in the world...'
'...he should be a hero
at least in his house.'
'I want yöu to wear it.'
'Who?'
'Her.'
'yöu.
'Whose necklace have
yöu stolen for me?'
'What did yöu say?'
'yöu think I'm a thief?'
Rakesh, what are yöu doing?
Leave it.
'My Sulo gets happy
when she gets a gift.'
'It makes me happy, too.'
Eat.
'My family becomes a happy family.'
Are yöu dieting?
I do this for my family.
'For their happiness.'
'I have just one dream in life.'
'That my Sulo
considers me her hero.'
‘That she tells
me that she loves me.‘
'So that even I can say to her...'
Madam, don't worry.
yöu won't have any complaints
against me henceforth.
A criminal always goes
back to the crime scene.
And a lover always comes back
to the place where he fell in love.
I sent yöu to Goa with high hopes,
to kill Caesar.
Can I tell yöu a secret?
He didn't kill yöur wife.
It was someone else.
A beast like yöu who's killing
women using different weapons.
But do yöu know what
his most special weapon is?
A screwdriver.
Look at this.
He has committed these murders
..in such brutal ways.
It's difficult to make
out who's someone's mother...
...and who's someone's wife.
yöu're angry, aren't yöu?
yöu're furious.
But just as yöu didn't
let me take my revenge...
...l won't let yöu
take yöur revenge either.
Let's see who wins now.
yöur love or my hatred.
Thank yöu! Thank yöu!
Bye, dear! Bye!
I want to help yöu fulfill
the remaining wishes in yöur diary.
Do yöu want to hear a joke?
Yes.
Forget it. I don't want to say it.
Because yöu'll listen to the joke
as if yöu're sympathizing with me.
Thank yöu.
But I don't need it.
I've breathed in this
city as much as I could.
Now it's time to fly to another place
and breathe for as long as I can.
My father was addicted to gambling.
He used to bet in cards,
cricket, everything.
And one day, he lost so
much that he bet on his life.
'I was 8 years old when my
parents were killed in front of me.'
'I was hiding under the bed.'
'I didn't do anything to save them.'
'After that, people tried
to give me shelter in their homes.'
'But I didn't want shelter.
I wanted revenge.'
'One day, I took my revenge.'
'I killed those people
who orphaned me.'
'I thought I'd be
peaceful after that.'
'That I'd be able to sleep.'
'But I was wrong.'
The other day,
when I helped Chotu with yöu...
...was the first time
that I slept peacefully.
I was relaxed.
Why did that happen?
Because for the first time,
yöu did something for someone else.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.
Only light can do that.
Hate cannot drive out hate.
Only love can do that.
That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...
...is still over there.
He only needs someone's hand.
Someone's support.
Someone who can pull him out of
the darkness and bring him to light.
Unless we share
someone else's pain...
...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.

Aisha!
Aisha.
I slipped. I'm fine.
Aisha, yöu're not well.
Let's go back.
Are yöu crazy?
Peacocks dance only
on the first rain.
Since we've come this far,
let's wait for some time.
yöu can see it some other time.
Let's go back now. Come on.
I don't have much time.
The peacock danced already.
Come next year, sir!
It's going to rain heavily.
yöu're back?
It's impossible for her to survive.
Please don't waste my time.
I just can't help her.
Hey! Who do yöu think yöu are!
Are yöu God!
- What are yöu doing!
Back off! Are yöu God
to say that she can't survive!
Save her or I'll kill yöu today!
Save her!
If I could save her, then wouldn't
I have saved my wife first...
...who is dying each day with cancer!
In spite of being a doctor,
I am as helpless as yöu are.
If yöu have to try one last time...
...then take Aisha to Mumbai.
There's a doctor over there.
Prema Shrivastav.
'She couldn't help me.'
'But maybe she can help yöu.'
Guru, yöu fulfilled
so many wishes of mine.
Can yöu fulfil another one?
If I die before
fulfilling all these...
...then yöu fulfil the rest
of the wishes for me. Okay?
But don't worry.
Even after I die, don't
think that I'll leave yöu alone.
I'll always be with yöu.
Like the breeze.
Just close yöur eyes
and feel the breeze.
Whenever it touches yöur face...
...it would mean that it's me.
God, thank yöu.
Everything is perfect in my house.
Mother and father
don't quarrel anymore.
Please keep everyone happy.
And I promise to offer
my cars to yöu nine more times.
Thank yöu.
God, these are my favourite toys.
Take them away.
But please keep my family happy.
Can I help?
Did a girl give yöu this?
No. My father gave it to me.
What are yöu doing?
yöu're taking so long.
If we get late,
then the theatre will be full.
And anyway, yöu can't afford
to pay extra for the tickets.
Hurry Up.
We will get the tickets, Sulo.
Don't worry.
Why? ls it yöur father's theatre?
Did yöu get it as a gift?
Look, I'm warning yöu.
If I miss the hero's entry, then
I won't watch the rest of the movie.
Anyway, we get to see
a hero only on the big screen...
...and not in real life.
What are yöu doing, Rakesh?
Leave this.
Give it to me.
Give us some money.
I'll pray yöu two
always stay together.
Hold on.
Give us happily.
Give us some money.
- Give us some money.
Take this.
I don't have more than this.
Okay.
Why did yöu give them money?
They were harassing us.
If I hadn't given them money,
then they wouldn't have gone.
What kind of a man is he?
Anyone can take advantage of him.
Driver, stop. Please stop.
Why are yöu getting down?
I don't have money
to go any further.
What?
- I spent all the money, Sulo.
Driver, take this.
Come. Let's go.
- Leave him.
Go.
But Sum...
But what?
yöu think I don't have any money?
I've saved some money.
It's my money.
If I depend on yöu, then I'll
have to beg on the street someday.
Let's go, driver.
- But Sulo... how will I go home?
Just as yöu go everyday!
In the crowded train!
'I married yöu with many dreams.'
'But all my dreams have shattered.'
'Every small business man
has a car now.'
'But yöu'll always remain a beggar.'
'I'm ill fated. It's not yöur mistake.'
'yöu're an idiot.'
yöu're useless, man.
yöu're completely useless.
Then what happened? yöu know
what had happened on Christmas?
It's not yöur cup of tea.
yöu're running behind her.
But yöu'll not get her.
She won't listen to yöu.
But will yöu not listen to me?
I had told yöu.
Listen to me and do something.
Did yöu stop laughing now?
yöu were laughing at me,
weren't yöu?
All of yöu like making
fun of me, right?
The Xerox machine in
the office works more than me.
Call yöur Xerox machine.
To save yöur life.
Don't worry, madam.
Henceforth, yöu won't
have any complaints against me.
She slipped and fell.
When I came walking from there,
I saw her lying here.
Hey Help.
I won't let yöu die.
But I will still kill yöu every day.
Not once, but a thousand times.
yöu will face death each time...
...but it won't come to yöu.
The more yöu try to embrace death...
...the longer yöu'll live.
I will keep an account of
every drop of blood that yöu shed.
I will capture yöur last breath.
I'll hit yöu so much...
...that yöu will be in
pain as long as yöu're alive...
...and yöur soul will
scream after yöu die.
Hit me.
Hit me. Why do yöu spare me?
Hit me.
Go in and get yöurself treated.
First yöu hit me...
...then yöu save me...
...and then yöu bring me
to a hospital and give me money.
Who are yöu?
lam the one who won't
let yöu die in peace...
... No will I let yöu live in peace.
Get the medicine.
Get yöurself cured.
Because once yöur pain is soothed...
...once yöur wounds are healed...
...I'll be back to
inflict new wounds.
This is yöur fate now.
This is yöur punishment.
Mother, who hit father?
Keep quiet.
Go out.
Listen. Stay inside the hospital.
Don't go out. Okay?
yöur boss was attacked yesterday.
Today yöu were attacked.
Either the whole office
has a lot of enemies...
...or yöu're each other's enemies.
Come on. Tell me from the beginning.
Excuse me. What are yöu doing?
yöu're not allowed to give
outside food to the patient.
Do yöu want him to eat
the hospital food?
Do yöu intend to make him sick?
These are the rules of the hospital.
yöu're not allowed to give
the patient anything besides fruits.
Close yöur lunchbox.
I'm closing it.
Can't yöu see? I won't give him.
But they didn't listen.
I'm warning yöu.
This will not be tolerated here.
- Then they started hitting me.
I can't believe this.
yöu can't help it, sir.
Some people are very bad.
Fine. I'll come back for
more information.
- Show me those medicines.
yöu've never even
killed a fly at home.
What was the need to hit goons
on the street and try to be a hero?
Look at yöur face.
Look what yöu've done to yöurself.
Moreover, yöu got yöurself
admitted in such a reputed hospital.
How will we pay the fees?
Take this.
For the fees.
This...
I don't like to yell at yöu.
But if something
had happened to yöu...
...then what would my Manu have done?
I'm sorry, Sulo.
I love yöu.
What's this?
I just told yöu that he's
not allowed to eat outside food.
Don't yöu understand
when yöu're explained once?
Security!
- Why are yöu calling the security?
What's yöur job?
To clean everyone's mess.
But yöu're behaving like a queen.
Sulo. - I wonder
where they've come from.
yöu leave.
Take care.
I'm sorry, madam.
I shouldn't have any
complaints henceforth.
I can't get there.
God!
I'm sorry. I couldn't come
to pray this week.
Guru?
Are yöu okay?
Listen, I'm really sorry.
I can't believe that
this happened to Aisha.
God plays such
strange games with us.
She was going to bring
a new life into this world, but...
Yes.
She was pregnant.
Didn't she tell yöu?
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Please take care of yöurself.
Again this tube light
started flickering.
There's no maintenance here.
The more yöu struggle...
...the more it'll hurt.
If yöu slay calm,
I'll kill yöu lovingly.
yöu killed my baby.
yöu killed my baby!
She was pregnant.
She was pregnant!
yöu killed my baby.
She was pregnant!
She was pregnant!
She was pregnant!
She was pregnant!
She was pregnant!
yöu killed my baby!
He's dead! He's dead!
Get up!
Get up!
yöu can't die so easily.
Get up!
yöu can't die so easily! Get up!
Hey! yöu can't die so easily!
Get up!
Hey! Make him alive.
Please let me go! I won't tell anyone!
- Hey! He must live for me.
He can't die so easily!
Bring him back to life!
Get up!
- He needs..
This... has to go... in his heart...
He killed yöur baby.
Even then yöu saved his life?
Why?
Why didn't yöu let him die?
Spare my son, Guru.
The man who killed yöur son...
...is he present in the court?
Madam, is he present in the court?
Answer me.
No.
He's not here.
Hold the police also.
Deepu's death was an accident.
Due to lack of evidence, Deepu's
death is declared an accident...
...and this case is dismissed.
Accused is set free.
I haven't forgotten my son's death.
 No am I scared of yöu.
yöu want to know why I didn't
testify against yöu, don't yöu?
Because yöu will be punished
not by a judge in court but by God.
How did yöu get away from
the bullets the other day?
Because He has a punishment
worse than death for yöu.
One day, yöur dear one
will die in front of yöu.
And yöu won't be able to save him.
Passenger, please pay attention.
Janshatabdi express from
Goa to Mumbai
..will depart from platform number 6
on it's scheduled time.
Aisha.
yöu're always running in life.
From one place to another.
Who are yöu running away from today?
I'm not running away from anyone.
Look, dear,
there is a kind of laughter...
...which a person learns
to hide his sorrow in life.
And there is another
kind of laughter...
...that helps a person
forget all his sorrow.
yöu've found this laughter
after meeting Guru.
yöu've found it in his love.
What's the use of this love...
...that will make him
cry after making him smile?
I'm not running away from him.
I'm just stopping him
from running after me.
Aisha!
Aisha!
Aisha!
Aisha!
Aisha.
Aisha!
Do yöu want to hear a joke?
Once, a man was drowning in the sea.
He started praying
to God to save him.
A fishing boat came.
He said, "Give me yöur hand."
The man said, "No.
God will save me."
Then a ship came.
The captain said, "Hold my hand."
He said, "No. God will save me."
The man drowned.
After his death, he asked God,
"Why didn't yöu save me?"
God said, "yöu think yöur
father sent that boat and ship?"
Aisha, I know that I might
not be able to save yöu from dying.
But by holding my hand,
yöu can keep me alive.
Hold my hand, Aisha.
And get me out of
darkness into light.
Hold my hand, Aisha!
Pull me out of darkness
into light, Aisha!
Aisha, don't go.
Aisha!
Aisha, don't go.
Aisha, don't leave me.
Aisha.

We have the time.
- Yes.
We will fulfill it together.

ls this okay?
yöu look like a hero.
If I was the interviewer,
do yöu know what I would have done?
Wait. Let me get curd
and sugar for good luck.
Hi, Dr. Prema.
Aisha, yöur reports have come.
And they state that yöu're pregnant.
Aisha!
Are yöu there?
- Yeah.
Doctor...
Will my illness have
a negative effect on my baby?
No, Aisha.
yöur baby is not in danger.
But I'm concemed about yöu.
Aisha, I don't think yöu have the
strength to give birth to this baby.
yöu've just come into
remission from yöur illness.
yöur body is still very weak.
I think yöu should tell Guru
about yöur pregnancy and this risk.
'He's the father of this child.
He has a right to know.'
'yöu both must take this decision
and that too very quickly.'
Aisha, what are yöu doing?
It's behind.
Listen.
Best of luck.
Aisha, are yöu sure
yöu want this child?
Did yöu tell Guru?
I will tell him.
I'm just afraid...
...that if he feels that something might
happen to me because of this baby...
...then he'll try to stop me.
But his fear is justified, dear.
But this life that
I've got because of Guru...
...is playing
hide-and-seek with death.
It has to end someday.
Then my Guru will be
back into the darkness.
He will need someone then,
who'll hold his hand...
...and bring him into light.
And the one who'll hold his hand...
...will be our child.
My child, light and darkness means life.
Now, He'll show yöu the correct path.
The Lord's and my blessings
are always with yöu.
Have yöu worked somewhere earlier?
Actually, I shouldn't crack
jokes about God in front of God.
I'm sorry.
Don't mind, but I have no mind.
Catch catch.
Oh gosh!
Hey, mister!
Yes, I'm talking to yöu.
Aren't there enough potholes in the
city that yöu've dug another one?
For the past two weeks.
Those kids and my God were
saved by a hair's breadth today.
'All my dreams have shattered.'
'It's not yöur mistake,
I'm ill fated.'
'I had many choices.'
'But I was ill fated to marry yöu.'
'Middle class man.'
Don't worry, madam.
yöu won't have any
complaints henceforth.
Fine. Let's see.
Hello.
Do yöu want to hear the
bad news first or the worst news?
The bad news is that yöu'll
have to live without me every day...
...between 9 to 5 from now on.
And the worst news is that I
won't be able to live without yöu...
...between 9 to 5 from now on.
I got the job, Aisha.
I got the job.
I'm independent now.
Guru, there's something
that I have to say to yöu.
Tell me.
No. Come home first.
Tell me. I'm on my way home.
No, come home.
Hello. How did yöu get in?
Aisha?
What are yöu doing?
- Aisha?
Does anyone barge
into someone's house...
...without ringing the bell?
Get out of here!
Aisha, who's over there? Aisha!
Who is it? What happened, Aisha?
Hey! Aisha!
Listen! Whoever yöu are,
yöu're my enemy.
Guru!
It's not her mistake.
Spare her. Aisha!
Hey! Listen! Spare her. Aisha!
Aisha!
- Guru!
Stop! Taxi! Stop!
Aisha! - Guru!
- Aisha! I'm coming.
Help me.
I'm pregnant.
Please don't kill me.
I want to give birth to this baby.
I want to have this child.
Please don't kill me.
Stop! Taxi, stop.
Hurry up, deep-
HI.
Am I disturbing yöu?
I see. yöu were following Rakesh.
Go.
Run.
Run!
Hey, back off.
Back
Just a minute, Madam. Madam.
Madam, do yöu know
where yöur husband is?
Please, let us go.
We didn't do anything.
I think there's
some misunderstandings.
My husband didn't do anything.
Do yöu remember what I told yöu?
Whenever yöu try to take
yöur revenge, I'll come in yöur way.
Do yöu remember!
I know yöu're not
scared of my bullet.
yöu know that if yöu follow him,
then the police will catch him.
His crime will be proved and yöur
revenge will be left incomplete.
Rakes!!
Get inside.
The police will catch
Rakesh Mahadkar eventually.
Because his wife
is in their custody.
But for now,
let's go to the police station.
Someone's waiting
for yöu over there.
Hey!
yöu got beaten again?
Will yöu come with me to Mira Road?
Mira Road!
yöu've become a man!
Take me away from here.
After being beaten, yöu
want someone to heal yöur wounds.
Rakesh Mahadkar is the one
who killed women in the city.
He's absconding.
But police is making all
the efforts to nab him.
Look there.

Tell me something.
Note down the details.

I always thought yöu were a loser.
But yöu proved me wrong.
Do yöu know how many
blessings yöu must have got...
...from those men
whose wives yöu killed?
But what did my friendship lack?
Why did yöu spare my wife?
Why are yöu sitting here?
Hey, handsome.
Will yöu come to the pool?
Hey, hot baby!
Tell me something.
Do yöu want to sing a solo song
with him or a duet with both of us?
Looks like yöur friend is neither
interested in a solo,  No in a duet.
I think he's either
impotent or he likes men.
yöu're talking too much.
But yöu don't know my friend.
Brother, yöu'll have to shut her up.
Come on. Have a drink.
Darling, where's the ice?
I'll just get it.
Hot girls forget to
get the coldest thing.
Who is this man who's after me?
He too is his wife's lover,
just like yöu.
I'm sure he's the husband
Of one of the women that yöu killed.
I'm sure.
100 percent.
He's playing with yöu.
Just as a lion plays
with his prey in the forest.
He catches it and then let's it go,
and then catches it again.
He chases it, catches it and
then let's it go again.
Until yöu keep running,
he'll keep chasing yöu.
The day yöu turn the tables,
yöu'll be the hunter.
And he'll be the prey.
'I won't let yöu die.'
'But I will still
kill yöu every day.'
'The more yöu try
to embrace death...'
'...the longer yöu'll live.'
'She was pregnant.'
'yöu killed my baby.
She was pregnant.'
'I'm pregnant.'
'I want to give birth to this baby.'
'Guru!'
My husband is the most kind...
...truthful and decent
man in the world.
He would murder someone...
That's impossible.
This is Guru's conspiracy.
Maybe, he killed his wife too.
And also those women.
I'm telling yöu.
Even the police
are involved in this.
They are involved with Guru.
They will kill my husband
and accuse him of everything.
I beg of yöu.
Please save my Rakesh.
Please save my Rakesh.
Lord!
Please send my Rakesh back to me.
I promise yöu.
I will never ask him to leave the house.
I'll never fight with him.
Please send my Rakesh
back to me, God!
I love yöu, Rakesh.
Are yöu listening?
Please come back home.
Sulu..
Wherever yöu are,
please come home.
Come back.
I love yöu, Rakesh.
Hove yöu, Sum.
Yes, sir. He's been bailed.
I'll ask him to talk to yöu.
Hold on, sir.
Sir, phone.
It's Caesar sir's call, sir.
Aisha Verma.
Sai Kripa Society. Versova.
This was her address, right?
When I learnt that she's pregnant...
...l was as happy as a person gets...
...on knowing about
a buy 1 get 1 free offer.
Buy a shampoo and
get a soap bar free.
Kill the mother and the son
or the daughter is killed for free.
I won't punish yöu now.
I'll kill yöu.
Sorry, but my life
was on a limited offer.
Till stocks last only.
yöu wanted to play with me.
But now yöu'll realise what a big
mistake yöu made by sparing my life.
yöu want to take my Sulo
and my son away from me, right?
Before that, I'll lake the
rest of yöur family away from yöu.
yöu like to save people
from being killed by me, right?
To interfere.
But yöu have a strange talent.
yöu save the outsiders...
...but not yöur family.
Send police to Aisha's
father's house immediately.
Rakesh has come to know who I am.
Save him. I'll do whatever yöu want.
Just save him.
Tell me.
Sawan!
Stop! Where are yöu going? Stop!
Where are yöu going?
Stop! - Stop!
Hey! Leave him. Let him come.
Don't kill me.
Sir, before Guru finds me
and kills me, I want to surrender.
Where are yöu right now?
I've seen many rogues
in my career as a policeman.
But I've never come
across such an insolent before.
If he gets away because of me...
...then neither God,  No
I will be able to forgive myself.
I've always been
an obstacle for yöu.
I've been the villain of yöur life.
But I'm saying this to yöu today.
Go and kill him.
He's taking shelter in the
place where he committed the crime.
He's in Aisha and yöur house.
Aisha was wrong.
I fought death and
got life back for Aisha.
I got light back into my life.
But by killing her,
yöu've spread darkness again.
Aisha was wrong.
No lamp can bring
light into this darkness.
Only the fire of yöur
pyre can bring light back.
Aisha was wrong.
Aisha was wrong.
Aisha was wrong.
Please let me go!
Please forgive me! Please!
Please forgive me! Please!
Please forgive me!
Please forgive me!
This is what yöu
wanted to hear, right?
yöu wanted me to beg for my
life just as yöur Aisha did. Right?
I won't.
What did yöu think?
That yöu found me here?
No.
I brought yöu here.
I called that policeman.
I knew that yöu would get
furious on knowing my whereabouts.
The place where I killed yöur wife...
I knew yöu would come running to me.
I made yöu what I could never be.
Employee of the year.
My Employee.
If the police had caught me,
I would go to prison.
All my crimes would be proved.
My Sulo would have hated me.
The end of my love story
wouldn't have been a happy one.
Take this. Take it.
Kill me.
yöu'll kill me...
...and I'll become
a hero for my Sulo.
Kill me!
Please don't kill me!
I want to live!
I'm pregnant!
I want to give birth to my baby!
I'm pregnant!
Look at this.
yöu and I are like twin brothers
who were separated in childhood.
We're the same.
yöu want to kill me for yöur wife.
And I was killing
everyone for my wife.
yöu have no idea what
A big favour yöu've done on me.
Because of yöur revenge story...
...my Sulo said in front
of everyone that she loves me.
Thank yöu, my friend.
Hello, Guru,
Sir wants to talk to yöu.
I threw yöur wife from here.
Throw me down.
Avenge yöur wife's death.
Kill me. Let me win.
Let me be the hero of
this story and be the villain!
Rakes!!
My husband is not here.
Who are yöu?
What are yöu doing here?
Mother! - Manish!
Where are yöu taking my son?
Mother!
- Leave him!
Mother!
- Manish!
Leave him.
Why are yöu doing this to us?
Please spare my son!
I beg of yöu!
Guru.
Rakesh killed yöur wife.
What have we done to yöu?
- I'll kill his wife.
Sulo! - Please spare my son!
For God's sake!
Rakes! - Leave me.
Please spare my son! For God's sake!
Spare my son.
Let go off her.
Sulol Sulol
- Rakesh.
Sulo! - Let her go.
- Help! Rakesh.
Sulo! Sulo! Sulo!
- Manish!
Sulol - Manish.
Spare my son.
Please spare him...
Manish - Spare him.
Please please spare him.
Rakesh! Rakesh! - Sulo!
Sulo! - Mummy!
Sum...
Sum...
Now, it's his son's turn.
But yöu'll kill him. I won't.
I'm waiting for yöu
at RakesWs house, Guru.
Come. - sum.
Come home, Guru.
yöu killed my Sulo.
yöu killed my Sulo!
yöu killed my Sulol
yöu killed Sulo.
yöu killed Sulo.
yöu killed my Sulo!
On this road...
...this story began.
yöur wife was right.
Someone would die over here someday.
On this road...
...I'll kill yöu...
...and bring an end...
...to this story.
Who did this?
I. I didn't do it.
Can't yöu drive properly?
There was a pothole.
Car lost its balance.
What happened?
He is dead.
'Darkness cannot
drive out darkness.'
'Only light can do that.'
'Hate cannot drive out hate.'
'Only love can do that.'
'That 8-year-old child who
was under the bed out of fear...'
'...is still over there.'
'He only needs someone's hand.'
'Someone-'s support.'
'Someone who can pull him out of the
darkness and bring him to light.'
'Unless we share
someone else's pain...'
'...we can never relieve
ourselves of pain.'
Do yöu want to hear a joke?
Once, there was a beggar.
He called up in the five star hotel
and ordered for a burger..
pizza and sweet dish.
Waiter asked him...
..in whose name
the order shall be placed?
Beggar said
..give it in the name of God.
