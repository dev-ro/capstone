Who's there?
Sebastian.
Sebastian!
Hmm?
A word.
You have to give me
something, Sebastian.
Something more
than this.
Project scope.
Repatriation
of the long-term comatose.
Hmm.
Progress report:
on track.
Hmm.
Two words.
I gave you a page of space.
It was supposed to be a hint.
What did you want me to do,
write an essay?
I don't have time, and they
wouldn't understand it anyway.
I know that.
You know that.
But do they want
to hear that?
You're the chairman,
for God's sake.
I'm the chairman
of a pack of sharks.
They smell blood
in the water,
they'll rip me to pieces.
You know the business
I'm in.
It's not medicine.
It's PR.
And I can't pretend that that
nurse business helped either.
Though I'm not responsible
every time so prepubescent
gets cold feet and decides
to bugger off.
Look, don't bring the curtain
down on me.
I'm closer now
than I've ever been.
You better be.
You bloody well
better be.
I can give you
two months maximum.
Then you've got to come up
with some of your own magic.
Right?
Right.
You're getting soft
in your old age,
you know that?
WOMAN:
I feel that my...
I know that my...
I'm sure that my--
Oh, shit. Shit, shit.
Hello?
Hello?
Matron Cassidy?
You're early.
Oh, the GPS on my phone
knows where I am before I--
Follow me.
Well, you certainly
seem qualified,
academically speaking.
But we're engaged
in more than theory here.
Oh, I'm excited
by this opportunity--
I can't afford to take
any chances.
We don't have
that luxury here.
Traumatic brain injury stream.
Yes.
Result?
High distinction.
The eye characteristic
a grade 2
on the Glasgow Coma Scale.
Oh.
The subject opens eyes
in response
to painful stimuli.
Patient has been in a vegetative
state for several months.
What are the complications
to the digestive system?
An excess secretion
of stomach acids.
With an increased risk
of gastric ulceration.
So you're an expert.
Are you going to tell me
how to do my job?
No, Doctor.
Mm-hmm.
We're doing remarkable
things here.
Are you ready to do remarkable
things, Miss Jacquard?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Hire her.
The pay is minimum,
the hours abominable,
and I reserve the right
to terminate your employment
without notice.
Agreed?
Hmm. Not a bad fit.
It's almost new, too.
The last one wasn't around
long enough to get it all grimy.
What happened?
Mmm... I don't know.
I came in one day and the
ice queen told me she was gone.
Got the impression
she went AWOL.
This place has a revolving door
on it.
I'm the only one stupid enough
to stick around.
Oh, shit. Sorry.
I'm not selling it very well,
am I?
Crusty old place, isn't it?
Used to be a convent.
Rooms no one's been in
for years.
Bit of a maze, really.
Couple of the other nurses
reckoned it was haunted.
But the only spook I've ever
seen around here is Cassidy.
She's not exactly
friendly, is she?
It's mostly bark.
Still, you can't really blame
her for being a bit cranky.
She grew up in here.
No dolls or party dresses
for her.
Just Dr. Roget
and the zombies.
Oh, she grew up here?
What do you mean?
Yeah. You didn't know?
She's his daughter.
I suppose they don't
advertise it.
It's kind of cute
in a creepy way.
Went to the family
business.
I have heard that she did
have a life once outside.
Well, a husband,
at least.
Supposedly he offed himself.
I can hardly blame him.
What's the doctor like?
Roget?
Um, lives in his
own world.
Down in the lab
most of the time.
Strictly off limits.
But you're the, um,
specialist.
You'll be helping him out
up here.
My strengths are bodily fluids
and sponge baths.
Ready to meet
the party crowd?
Car crash, motorcycle,
complications
from brain surgery,
stroke, boot to the head,
unlucky,
and hit a sand bar
diving off a pier.
My God.
What about visitors?
Relatives?
Count them on one hand.
People end up down here
because they're pretty much
forgotten.
It's an involuntary
muscle reaction.
It doesn't mean anything.
Sorry. I know.
You'll get used to it.
At least you'd better hope
you do.
Nurse Williams.
A moment in my office,
please.
Whatever pickup line he used,
it worked.
Patrick, Kathy.
Kathy, Patrick.
He's pristine.
The muscle tone.
There's no wasting.
How?
Electrical treatments.
Drugs.
I don't really know.
He's Roget's
special project.
KATHY:
What happened to him?
Some kind of accident
with his family.
I think he was
the only survivor.
Hello, Patrick.
I felt like it was
on purpose.
Oh, if there's one thing
about our friend Patrick,
he doesn't do anything
on purpose.
It's an involuntary--
Muscle reaction.
You're learning fast.
Hello?
That's fine.
Let him go.
That's fine.
Well, fine for him.
That's Mr. Fraser,
our resident athlete.
What happened to him?
Electrical explosion.
He was a railway signalman,
whatever that is.
Come on.
He's obsessed with time.
Well, being on time.
On time for what?
Shh.
Come here.
He does it
every night.
Sometimes he sits up there
till the morning,
just to switch it off.
It was Roget's idea.
He was a total basket case
before he had something
to focus on.
The thing hadn't been
switched on in years.
Why is he here?
I mean, he can
definitely walk.
As far as I know
he came in the normal way:
on his back,
dead to the world.
Roget managed
to wake him up.
God!
Kathy, open up.
Paula, you scared the crap
out of me.
What's wrong?
I'm bored
out of my skull.
Five minutes.
Get changed.
Go on.
Go on.
Just one, love.
And here she comes.
See you later.
See you later.
Someone's popular.
Oh, you will be too.
And I promise, not everyone
who drinks here is--
Like that?
Exactly.
Cheers.
Cheers.
I mean,
only if you're, um,
looking for...
a distraction.
Tan line
on the ring finger.
You know when people say,
"It's not you, it's me"?
Mm-hmm.
It was me.
You played some away game.
No.
It was nothing
like that.
- Hey, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, mate.
Nurse Williams.
Always a healing sight.
Hello, we haven't met.
Dr. Brian Wright,
this is Kathy--
Jacquard.
Kathy's our latest
arrival.
Another of the belles
among the brain-dead.
Seat's empty, Brian.
Can't.
Deadline looms.
Just came down to pick up
a bottle of inspiration.
But soon. Deal?
Hmm.
So, what do you think?
He's a bit sure
of himself.
Did you say doctor?
Psychiatrist.
I don't think he practices much
anymore, though.
He writes,
and he's on the radio.
He has an amazing
beach house
and a really nice place
in the city too.
Mm-hmm.
What?
- Mmm?
- Once or twice.
Uh-huh.
Okay, maybe more than
a few times.
But it was a very,
very long time ago.
And I don't have dibs on him
if you want to...
I just...
You move fast, right?
We've had a death.
It's, um,
diving accident.
Funny, you know.
When they go,
you realize you sort of become
quite attached to them.
Doctor.
This patient isn't dead.
No need for it
down here, then.
Put it back.
See me at room 15.
Once the medication
is administered
the window of opportunity
is vanishingly small.
We're waking up
dormant neurons,
goading them into making
new connections.
And they're mercurial
little bastards.
Very hard to train.
We only have a matter of minutes
to get them to do what we want
before the drug
wears off.
So you follow my instructions
to the letter.
Yes, Doctor.
But when that door opens,
your old ways die.
We're trailblazers,
do you understand?
He spits, you know.
Ophthalmoscope.
Retinal vessel perfusion
distinct.
Perturbation peaking at...
... four seconds.
Perturbing the base line
in eight seconds.
Slightly perturbed
frontal lobe.
Returning to base line...
... in three seconds now.
Damn.
Too much attenuation.
Clean up the patient,
nurse.
Okay, Patrick.
This might sting a bit.
What did you say?
Oh, nothing, Doctor.
I was just talking to him,
I suppose.
What were you
discussing?
Doctor, are you
absolutely certain
that he isn't aware
of us?
Nurse Jacquard,
I have monitored him
for 24 hours a day
with an EEG that registers
every kind of brainwave
from a fart
to a nervous breakdown.
What do you suppose
it has registered?
I don't know, Doctor.
Just farts.
You're wasting your time,
Kath.
Nothing grows in here.
It must be all the, um,
electrical stuff.
It's a wonder we don't
glow in the dark.
Okay.
I might have said something
to Brian
about taking you
for dinner.
You could have asked me first.
- Fine. Shut me up.
Say you'll think
about it.
I'll think about it.
Jesus, Kathy.
Up, up.
I'm not trying to sell you
for body parts.
- Got him?
- Yes.
Do you know with a ridiculously
attractive man,
you spend way too much time here
at the vegetable farm.
Once in a while you should
speak to someone
other than a turnip.
Shit.
Stupid thing.
You can go,
and I'll finish up here.
Good.
Is anybody in there?
Nurse Jacquard.
What do you think
you're doing?
Attending--
- And who instructed you
you try to engage
this patient in conversation?
Step outside, please.
I will make myself
very plain.
You will not be given
the opportunity to hear me...
... say this again.
This facility presents
special challenges
to those who work here,
both for the body...
and for the mind.
You will not invest
emotionally
in any of the patients here.
- Am I understood?
- Yes.
Kathy.
- Brian, isn't it?
- Yes.
Never really liked it,
but I got used to it.
I'm recklessly
avoiding a deadline.
What's your excuse?
Just wanted to get out.
Needed somewhere cheery,
right?
So, what do you make
of Patrick?
How do you know
about him?
Williams.
Not much she doesn't
talk about.
Well, technically,
she's breaking her
confidentiality agreement.
Not sure if I should
as well.
The Roget veil of secrecy.
Do you think it's possible
that patients
in a vegetative state
can be aware?
Well, I guess that depends
on the quality of the diagnosis.
One of the tests
for a vegetative state
is that there is
no awareness.
Over-hopeful families
see meaningless twitches,
and read signs
of responsiveness.
I'm skeptical by nature,
and by training.
Don't know what this says
about me exactly,
but I'm feeling
a bit peckish.
There's a place
around the corner.
Two-thirds, maybe even
three-quarters decent coffee.
All right.

What the hell
did you do that for?
Paula, I really don't
feel like going out.
How about staying in?
I'm sorry for whatever I did,
or didn't do, the other day.
I honestly can't remember
a thing.
Thank you.
You're a great cook.
Yes, I am.
Actually, I can't take
all the credit.
They did most
of the work.
Fresh Corn.
Poor little things didn't know
what they were in for
when they woke up this morning.

Then again, who does?
Cheers to that.
What are you looking at?
Ed.
Hey.
How did you find me?
Oh, it's not hard to find
people these days, Kath.
We have to talk.
Leave.
There. Talking's finished.
Kath!
I think you should go.
It's fine, Brian.
Well, I'm staying
at the boat sheds.
I'm not going to leave
till we sort this out, yeah?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I think you should go too.
Look, I think I should stay.
- Shit.
- Oh, my God. What happened?
Oh, my God.
Shit.
Christ, Brian.
Nurse.
See to the patient.
Ah! Oh, God!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You felt that,
didn't you?
Patrick, can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Once for yes, twice for no.
Can you feel that?
That?
That?

That?

When you have a moment.
My office.
You have to listen to me.
Patrick is--
Not your concern.
He cried.
I was communicating
with him.
Nurse, these personal
experiments of yours
will cease immediately.
You will keep your eyes down,
your mouth shut,
your nose clean,
and your hands off.
Am I perfectly clear?
Dismissed.
But he...
he...
Would be better off dead.
They all would.
Nurse.
Show me.
Patrick, show the doctor
that you can hear me.
Same as before.
Patrick, show that you
can hear me.
He was communicating
with me.
How?
Spitting.
Alive. Correct?
Hmm.
Dead. Agreed?
Now, to imitate life...
... all bodily movement,
voluntary or otherwise,
depends upon electricity.
Stimulate the right
nerve centers,
and you see what happens.
Although he is a vegetable,
electrons still swarm
around inside 15's head.
Every now and then
enough of them
randomly conspire
to cause an action.
It signifies nothing.
As much as I would
wish it otherwise,
he is currently
160 pounds
of limp meat
hanging off
a dead brain.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Hmm.
Transcribe, please, nurse.
ROGET, OVER RECORDING:
Time: zero.
Time cluster: five seconds.
Patterns are eccentric and
seem to bear little relation
to expected outcome.
Patrick, you can hear me now,
can't you?
Why won't you
show the doctor?
On phase two...
Remember to tell me when
he has a bowel movement, yes?
Hmm.
... Plus 90 seconds.
Perhaps there's something
there.
I doubt it's the output.
Time plus 180 seconds.
What am I missing?
Patterns are eccentric...
Kathy, could you give me a hand
next door?
Kathy!
Sorry. Oh, I wasn't
concentrating.
That's my job.
Next door?
I don't require you.
Where on earth
did you get that from?
I won it in a raffle.
Doctor, this patient cannot
possibly give consent!
Indeed not, so I give consent
on his behalf.
Patrick, show him!
What good can it do?
Despite not being obliged
to answer your questions, nurse,
I will tell you again.
Our endeavors rely on my being
able to forge new connections
in 15's brain.
To do that, I need
to stir things up a bit.
I cannot do it
with a feather duster.
Now that you're here,
you can see to the patient.
He's not getting
any younger.
And neither am I.
Patrick.
Can you fell that?
Ed Penhaligon
in a place like this?
Better not let the golf club
find out.
I'm sure they've revoked
memberships for less.
Coming in from the outside,
your family...
Everyone is so
spectacular,
or expected to be.
What did you want me to do
about it?
Stand up to them.
Let them know, let me know,
that I'm good enough for you.
More than good enough.
I never thought
anything else, Jacs.
- Come here.
- Mm...
Come here. Come here.
You can do it.
I think we need a drink.
Ed, is something burning?
Ed?
Ed!
We're keeping him under
for a while.
In some ways, he's lucky
the trauma is so severe.
No nerves left,
no pain.
Yet.
It'll come, though.
But how the hell
did it happen?
A sandwich grill?
Ouch.
:
Patrick.
Can you hear me?
Do you want
the doctors stopped?
Why, Patrick?
Why is it a secret,
Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick.
:
Patrick?
Patrick?
Are you asleep?
If you're awake, Patrick,
then why won't you show anyone?
But why just me, Patrick?
Why no one else?
Kathy?
I'll leave you two alone.
You still don't remember
anything?
Nothing.
Just you screaming.
Psychologist came in
yesterday.
They're going to do
epilepsy tests now.
So the folks
are going to fly in.
Mom's doing the full
theatrics.
Ed, have I ever
seemed delusional to you?
You? God no.
It's this patient
at work.
Patrick.
Whenever I'm around,
he...
What is it, Jacs?
It all seems
so ridiculous.
Hey, when I get
out of here,
we're getting out
of here.
Deal?
We'll see.
Transcribe.
Patrick?
You said that you wanted me
to help you.
But you must need help.
I've seen what the doctor
does to you.
I don't understand.
Patrick?
You'll kill him.
You know that,
don't you?
Mmm.
Unethical things, Brian.
Like what?
Little or no protocols,
unorthodox methods,
treatment without consent.
What specifically?
Well, he's using
a shock therapy machine.
The thing looks like it fell off
the back of a truck in the '20s.
Shock therapy on coma patients?
What the hell for?
To try to blast them
back to life?
Why didn't you
tell me this before?
Look, I'm telling you now,
all right?
I'm going to make
a few calls.
To the department?
To the money.
Give me a day.
Thank you.
I really mean it.
What are you hiding from,
Patrick?
Watching what?
What do you know,
Patrick?
I don't need you
to do that, Patrick.
What have you been
telling your boyfriend?
Ed?
That fucking peacock
on the radio.
Brian?
He's been calling
with questions.
What does he know?
You're going to have
to ask him.
Did you have to push
so hard?
What did you
expect me to do?
I don't really know.
Some kind
of middle ground.
There isn't one.
This is big.
Establishment money.
Medical malpractice.
The lights are going to get
shut off and the locks changed.
That's the way
these things happen.
But Patrick, he...
He's...
He's what?
When will little happen?
Soon.
I'm going to come
and get you.
I'll call. If you're there
you drop everything, understand?
Okay.
I've done something
to help you.
We're not always the best judges
of what we need, Patrick.
You said so yourself.
I don't think I'll be here
much longer.
You're going
to have to decide.
Stay in your own world
alone,
or let other people in.
I can't, I won't,
be the only one.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
You have one new voice message.
Received at 1:00 p. m.
Sebastian, it's Morris.
I don't know what the fuck
has happened,
but the knives are out.
There's talk of an emergency
board meeting.
I'm stalling them,
but I'm running out of excuses.
Whatever you've got,
show it and show it now.
KATHY, OVER ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Kathy.
Ow!
Shit!
Ow!
Ow!
Please fasten your seat belt.
This is ending now.
You can't pummel him
into submission.
You're here to wipe up
mucous and urine.
I don't give a shit
what you have to say.
You will.
Nurse Jacquard.
Do you believe in God?
I don't.
But I do believe
in fate.
You see, I didn't choose
any of this.
It chose me.
And when you've been cursed
with true insight,
half the answer
is never enough.
Now, I have clawed my way up
the cliff face by my fingertips.
It has taken me decades
to get a glimpse of the peak.
And I don't have a minute
to spare.
Now, you are a prissy,
meddling little bitch
who's wasting my precious time,
and I would dearly love you
to fuck off.
ROGET:
I'm finally reaching you.
Everything I know
screams it out to me.
I'll make hiding in there
worse than being ripped out.
BRIAN, OVER ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Brian.
I can't get to the phone
right now,
so please leave a message.

Brian, it's Kathy.
Roget is insane.
Whatever you're going to do,
you do it now and call me.
Kathy!
Both of you, out.
Now.
Nurse.
Hey, hey.
Ah!
Ah! Oh!
She died in anguish,
you know.
My mother.
She knew that
after she was gone,
all that was left for me
was this.
She never understood.
But you do.
I know you do.
Shh.
I'm shocked and saddened
to have to tell you
that colleague and friend,
Dr. Brian Wright,
has been found dead.
The report states
that police divers
have recovered his body
from the waters below
the Old Coast Road.
He has been sent
to punish us.
No, no, no, Julia.
He's our legacy.
Everything we worked for.
I am this close.
I can't give up now.
You've got no idea
what you've done, Father.
Julia.
No.
I--
You. You killed him.
- Killed who?
- Brian.
Dr. Wright.
You killed him.
Oh, believe me, if I had it's
not an accomplishment I'd deny.
What are you going to do
with those, give me a haircut?
Get rid of her.
No need, Matron.
I'm leaving.
But I'll be back
with the licensing board
and the police.
If you leave,
it will all
be your fault.
You mustn't go back
to the clinic.
Not ever.
My father has done
terrible things.
I've done terrible things.
We will be punished
for them.
But it's not us
you have to fear.
The only thing more dangerous
than his hate...
is his love.
I was planning to settle this
by other means,
but I'm too tired
for any of that now.
Kathy.
- Ed?
- Kath, you all right?
Oh.
Please, Kathy,
what's going on?
I, um...
I'll call you back.
Just tell me--
Where the hell
have you been?
You've been called to the city.
An accident crash.
Male victim,
severe head trauma.
You were asked for
by name.
The family have money.
Lots of it.
Williams.

Um, I was just, um--
Do you have
your car here?
Um... yes.
We're out of ammonia.
There's none left
in the storeroom.
They won't have it
at the general store.
You'll have to drive
into town.
- How much do you want?
- Go.
- Are you all right?
- Now.
You're a cancer.
And you need
to be cut out.
Police divers have recovered
his body from the waters...
Ed!
ED:
Hi, this is Ed.
Please leave a message.
I can't explain it,
but you have to believe me.
Everyone close to me
is in terrible danger.
As soon as you get this,
leave.
It must be radio waves
or something.
Just get over the mountains.
Please run.
I'm not yours, Patrick!
I never will be!
You're a sick, twisted,
pathetic child, do you hear me?!
When you first came
I pitied you.
Even more than the others.
You were so...
beautiful.
But then I realized
what you were.
KATHY, OVER ANSWERING MACHINE:
I'm not yours, Patrick!
I never will be!
You're a sick, twisted,
pathetic child, do you hear me?
Hi, this is Kathy.
I can't take your call...
You were such a prize
for my father.
A puzzle he thought
he could solve.
But he has woken you
in ways that he will never
understand.
Good night, Patrick.
Lights out.
Huh?
Your little boy is here.
Get out of here.
You pathetic
little creep.
All you do is sneak around
and perv.
Is this what you want to see?
Huh?
Go on,
take a good look.
Julia?
ED:
Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Hello?
Is there anybody here?
Hi, I'm looking for,
um, Kathy Jacquard.
Is she here?
Uh, excuse me.
Hello?
I'm not sure if you understood.
I'm looking for Kathy?
Can you tell me
where Kathy is?
She's in danger.
You understand?
Excuse me.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Let me out! Hey!
Paula!
Paula!
Paula!
Patrick...
wants his hand job.
Paula.
- Patrick wants his hand job.
- Patrick wants his hand job.
Patrick wants his hand job.
PATIENTS:
Patrick wants his hand job...
Paula!
- Patrick wants his hand job.
- Patrick wants his hand job.
Patrick wants his hand job.
Shut up!
Paula.
Patrick, no.
She's done nothing to you.
Please.
Please let her go.
Kathy?
No!

Paula!

Yeah. I'm okay.
No!
Let me in!
Let me in!
Just end this now!
You're pathetic.
What are you scared of?
You think you love me,
Patrick?
You don't know
how to love.
Did you love your mother?
What did you think,
Patrick?
That if you stopped other men
from getting to me
that we'd be together
forever?
Who?
Who?!
Ed?
Ed! Answer me! Ed!
Let me in!

Where is he?
Where is he?
Ed?
"Cold. "
Ed?
Ed?
He made me.
You fucking lunatic.
Where is he?
Just tell me!
Don't!
Doctor!
Please!
Let me out!
I told you to get out of here,
you little perv.
Get out!
- Ed.
- Help!
Jesus, Ed.
Come on!
Let him out!
Help!
Please, please,

Can't move it.
Help!
No! Patrick!
Patrick! No! Stop!
How do I join you? How?!
What do you
want me to do?
Ah! Ah!
How?
I want to join you,
Patrick.
I do.
I want to be with you.
But I'm weak.
I'm scared.
You have to help me.
Kathy.
So this is Patrick.
- Good morning, Matron.
- Good morning, nurse.
Your package arrived.
- Thank you.
- Great, thanks.
Oh, nurse.
I'll be occupied
until after lunch.
That's fine.
Hey. Hey.
