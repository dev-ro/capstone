The Unknown
This is a story they...
...tell in old Madrid...
...it's a story they say is true.
"You all know me...
...Antonio Zanzi... and my gypsy circus..."
"...and now, the sensation of sensations!
The wonder of wonders!
ALONZO, THE ARMLESS!"
"Assisting Alonzo in this...
...death-defying act, is my...
...daugter...NANON!"
MALABAR THE MIGHTY.
"You are right, Alonzo...
...brute strength does not...
...mean everything to all women".
"Alonzo, all my life men...
...have tried to put their beastly hands on me...
...to paw over me".
"I have grown so that I...
...shrink with fear when...
...any man even touches me".
"You are wise, Nanon.
Always fear them... always hate them".
"And remember...
...I am always near you...
...ready to help you".
"If it takes ten million years, Nanon...
...I will keep saying 'I love you'...
...until you believe me".
"No one will get her...
...no one but me!"
"See, Nanon! Eyes that adore you...
...hands that long to caress you...
...and strength to protect you!"
"Why do you always draw away from me?"
"Why isn't he different... 
...from other men!
Why doesn't he keep his hands of me?"
"Hands! Men's hands!
How I hate them!"
"Men! The beasts!
God would show wisdom if he took the...
...hands from all of them!"
"Forgive me, Alonzo...
...I did not mean you".
"You are the one man I...
...can come to without fear".
"She is with Alonzo again!
Are you afraid to deal with him?" 
"Putting crazy ideas in her...
...head again!
I'll settle this!"
"A thousand thanks, Malabar.
I will try to repay same day".
"You have Nanon in your heart,...
...haven't you?"
"In my heart... in my soul...
...in my blood!"
"You are fortunate.
You have arms...
...and strength that she loves".
"Go take her in your arms...
...and let her listen to the...
...song of your blood".
"Cojo... I said no one is going to have her!
No one but me!"
"There is a time for fear, Nanon...
...and a time for hate...
...and a time for love".
"You worry, Alonzo, that sometime...
...will find out you have arms?"
"What would the police give...
...to know I have hands...
...and who I am?"
"There they are, Cojo...
...and Zanzi may be another...
...to find how I have them".
"I have been waiting for you... to teach you...
...that my orders are law!"
"Stop them!
They've burned enough clothes to keep twenty...
...gypsy souls out of hell!"
"The same hands that strangled Zanzi...
...committed the robberies in other towns...
...where this circus played!
They're somwehere in this troupe!"
"Get your finger-prints taken!"
"What will happen, Alonzo...
...if they sell the circus to pay...
...my father's debts?"
"Do not worry, Nanon,...
...I promised your father I would...
...always take care of you".
"The circus has gone... every caravan.
Why did we not travel with them, Alonzo?"
"Because I want to take you...
...away from the things you hate, Nanon".
"I could not go away without...
...telling you again that I will...
...love you always".
"I am so sorry Malabar put his...
...hand on you again... so sorry".
"Cojo, did you see her?
She kissed me!"
"You must never let her touch...
you that way again".
"She will feel that you have arms!"
"Cojo will never tell!"
"There is nothing I will not
do to own her! Nothing...
do you understand? Nothing!"
"You are a riddle, Nanon.
You shrink from me...
yet you kiss my flowers
when I am gone".
"Then if you do care for me,
why won't you ever let me
hold you in my arms?"
"I know now what you fear".
"Some day that fear will die.
You will find me near you
always...waiting...loving
hoping".
"Cojo, I've got to have her!
She has got to marry me!"
"No Alonzo! On your wedding night
she would see your arms....and hate you!"
"No, Cojo....she would
never hate me...
she would forgive me".
"But you forget....she saw
her father strangled by a
hand with two thumbs".
"You are forgetting that you have arms!"
"No, no Alonzo! Not that!
Never do that!"
Leave the door to the operating room
open and be there at midnight - alone.
Remember Algiero, 20 years ago!
"Why this letter...
and who are you?"
"You're here to backmail me!
It's money you want!"
"Well....what is the price of
your silence about my past?"
"And be careful that I do not die
in this operation....
because I left a letter telling
who you are".
"I am afraid any more, Malabar.
All my foolish fears are gone".
"You're recovering rapidly.
You'll be able to leave in a few weeks".
"But we must wait until...
...Alonzo returns.
I want him with us at our wedding".
"Perhaps the landlady knows where she is.
Go ask, Cojo".
"But it's strange I've never
heard from Alonzo...
not one word since he went away".
"The landlady says she is at
that theatre on the plaza".
"You are thinner, Alonzo!
Have you been sick?"
"No not sick...
but I have lost some flesh".
"How is Cojo?
You love him best of anyone, don't you?"
"No, Nanon... not best".
"I am happy you have returned
Alonzo, now we can be married".
"Oh... I forgot. You have been away.
I well call him".
"Has Nanon told you the good news,
Alonzo?"
"Remember how I used to be
afraid of his hands?"
"I am not any more.
I love them now".
"Alonzo is laughing at the
way everything has happened".
"I did what you told me, Alonzo.
I took her in my arms..."
"I'm all right now".
"It was just something in here that
stung like the lash of a whip".
"They said you were rehearsing.
Is this your rigging!"
"See... I have a horse hitched
to each hand and they pull in
opposite directions".
"You see, when the horses are tugging
he could not let go if he wanted to".
"It's very dangerous.
Suppose the treadmills broke
or stopped suddenly".
"If that happens the horses
would tear my arms from my body".
"Do not say that! You make Alonzo
worry that something will happen to you".
"Do not worry, Alonzo...
Nothing will happen.
We have been rehearsing for weeks".
"I couldn't reach Nanon's robe.
Will you get it for me?"
So...
for Alonzo there was an end Hate called Death...
and for Nanon, an end to Hate...
called Love.
"Malabar, if I live ten million years,
I'll always say, 'I love you.'".
