since I got on this bus,
I've forgotten where I am
why I'm sitting here, or where I'm going
my face is burning
my head's vessels ache because of fever
I'm sure I'm not at that bus as I'm writing these
slowly, I become aware of my surroundings
empty aisles with series of metal shelves
the only things that are around me
I'm trying to understand where I am right now
these are the aisles of the place I work in
The place I'm always in
Hey Taghavi, where are you?
what?
it's been half an hour that the car is waiting outside
and I'm looking for you
and here you are, dreaming
what do you want?
entrance permit
- hello!, I'm telling you the pickup is waiting outside
- okay, go put that list on the table
- I'm coming
- come quick
okay
are you still sleep?!, hurry up
- here
- not this one, that one
- take it
what were you writing?
do you write poems, oh poet!
Don't touch them with your callousy hands
stand by the car, I'm coming
quick
- Hi
- Hi
Go, it’s done
- you haven't gotten well yet?
- no
- Mehrieh Ebrahimi
- excuse me
- she works in service section
- poor woman, she's got orphans to take care of
- she's got rent to pay too, who's gonna take care of her
- it's the layoff list and some who have retired
- see if my name is in it too?
- Hosseini Akbari is on the list too?
- yes, poor guy came here yesterday...
Mrs. Taghi nejad!
Mr. mohamadzahed
- Mr. Mohamadzadeh
- yes
look ma'am, if you want to complain, go to the Torabi's office
it's out of my hand, they gave me a list and I put it up on the wall
Since this morning You’ve been
driving me crazy with your complaints
- when did I complain?
- what is it then?
look at this
Why did you take the list off?
Give it to me
my name is neither in the layoff list nor in the retired list
what does this mean?
it means they haven't made a decision about you yet.
in a few days, they will, that's it
- people, it's out of my hand, believe me
- what are we supposed to do now
Farideh, for God's sake, Don't fret.
nothing has happened yet
be thankful to God that your name
is not on the layoff list
Farideh!

I won't drop you

- aah
- why don't you come, mom?
I'm coming
your film magazines are scattered everywhere again
I've told you a hundred time to gather up your stuff
Take this, my dear
why are you playing with your food?
Eat it
I don't drink orange juice!
it's not good for me, don't insist!
not that you ate those turnips I made for you
without making "Eww" sound
- what's wrong with you?
- huh?
why do you eat your food so fast?
chew your food, so you know what you're eating
after the tenth or twentieth times of chewing you know what you're eating
you get stomach ache by eating this fast
and then you will start whining "oh my stomach!, my bowels!"
and you don't notice how much I care about you
this is how you cover yourself, you have a cold half of the year
did you eat your turnips today or not?
no
- what's wrong with you?
- nothing
I'm trying to eat my food and it's like you're recording every move I make
you keep talking about stomach, bowel and chewing and that makes me lose my appetite
will I get stomach ache?
to hell with that
so, you're not eating anymore, huh?
no, I won't
thank you
where are you going?
I was bored today so I made jelly, it's in the kitchen with the fruits
you're the house lady, you don't let me be your servant?! huh?
my dear
what are you saying mom?
I'll bring it myself
after you get married you'll have time to cook,
to sew, to take care of the house
a girl at your age should enjoy her life
when I was at your age, your grandpa and I
used to go to the villages near the Sanandaj,
what great summers, they would liven you up
I had so many suitors
one of them was a sugar merchant in Iraq
one of them was from the north,
he drowned in the sea while he was asleep
one of them was living in the kurdistan's villages, right?
The one who had so many shopping malls
what did he left for his wife?
he didn't get married
after I rejected him
so the only goof-off was our father?
no?
don't talk about your father like this
ok
it's better not to talk with full mouth
how about not talking at all?
even better
even better
- darling, how's your miniature flower class?
- it's fine
- do you like it?
- yes
thanks god you like it
one should know some kind of art
someone might knock on this door at any moment
I don't want to give them a servant, I want to give them a Lady
aha, not that every night someone knocks on this door and comes in
enough, don't be rude
nobody is allowed to talk until we finish our dinner
these movies have ruined his brain,
it's all because of these movies
mom, you're talking right now
they don't let me work overtime given the situation I’m in
I’ll cover for you and punch in your card
my overtime's hours are in the onion room
it doesn't matter to me
I’d stay wherever it is
you said you couldn't work overtime and
I thought this way you can take care of your guests too
don't call them guests, call them Yazid's troops
everyday one of his relatives here
and there is nobody else but us
to host them
They’re swarming all over us
so, we have a deal?
- if you don't punch in my card and Torabi finds out, I'm in a big trouble
- don't worry
- count it
- you did it yourself
Sara, don't you ever think that just because I'm covering for you for a few nights
I'm asking you for money, I just borrow it from you
- no problem, don't forget to punch in
- ok
- I've put walnuts for you in the locker
don't forget to take them too
- thanks
you're not coming?
you go, I'll come in a moment
your order is ready
thank you
don't forget the discount
it's the best quality
please wrap it
we don't wrap here
Then give me that scotch tape
It’s not enough ma’am
Don’t haggle sir, thank you very much
Yalda
Yalda
Where are you?
Yalda
Hi mom
She locked herself in the bathroom again!
I’ve been in a hundred place since morning, I'm exhausted

I wish I was dead
What’s happened?
You don’t know what’s happened?!
I wish the ground would swallow me up because of what you do
Come out of there!
I told you to come out!
Hi
Hi
It’s all my fault
I spoiled you, I had it coming
How old are you Yalda?
You don’t know how old I am?
Yes, I know, but I thought you’ve grown up
But you’ve become like children
- What’s happened that made you so angry?
- nothing!
I’ve become your servant, working all day long
so you could lie to me
- Don’t be angry, mom
- okay, I’m not
Not anymore
how silly I am that I’ve bought these shoes 
to give you as an end of term gift
I thought my girl had learned something
I thought if somebody knocks on this door,
My girl would have had something against
the technical diploma of the boy
And I would tell them “here it is, my daughter’s art diploma”
Where is the towel?
I thought since your course is over today
It wouldn't be good to pick you up empty-handed
Where is this freaking towel?
I went to your class with so much enthusiasm
And I said “ma’am, please call my daughter”
And she says “we have nobody here with that name”
I told her “ma’am, my girl has been coming to this miniature flower class for 3 months and I’ve paid her tuition completely”
And today is her last day
She went through the list of the names and then told me
“yes, her name is here, but she’s come only 3 sessions”
I told her “what do you mean?” and she said “in her last session
She was supposed to explain about her work, she got into a panic
Sweated with fear
And vomited on the class’s floor
And after that she didn't show up again
Open the door!
I want to know if my daughter is not able to speak a few words
In front of 10 people?!
Where were you all these times you weren’t in the class
I was walking in the street
So Just because you didn't want me to find out, you walked
In the street three times a week for two hours?
I told you before I panic where there are
A lot of people
What do you want to do for the rest of your life?
Sitting around at home talking to
Your glass animals and cleaning them
You just got stressed out in one place, you want to mourn
For the rest of your life at home
I've seen unmarried girls who’ve been a burden
to their families all their lives
scolded by their sisters-in-law
But you are so beautiful
What should I do for you Yalda?
Mom, I like somebody
I mean I like a boy
- You’re trying to make me mad again?
- no
- You’ve become like your brother?, you probably want to say you’ve fallen in love With one of the pictures of these magazines
- no
- I'm telling you he’s a real person
- a real person!
A real boy
You don't even go out of this house
Always lock yourself in in that room
Well, not that I know him very much
But I think he’s a very good boy
My dear
You're blushing
My sweet daughter
So you weren’t walking all alone in the street
The days you were skipping your classes
- no, I haven’t seen him yet
- You haven’t?!
No, I just heard his voice
By phone?
Not that I talk to him myself
I just heard his voice, that’s it
I can't make any sense of what you're saying, Yalda
Why do you mean?
one day He came here with Ehsan, he’s a friend of Ehsan
I didn't came out of the room, I just heard their voices
...Ehsan had brought some stuff with himself...
He had written some stuff, and he was reading them
Then suddenly started singing
And then Reza told him, you should say these in poem
And I will sing them later
Then they started recording
their voices on a tape as a keepsake
So his name is Reza?
Mom, I wasn’t eavesdropping
They were speaking loudly, I don't want to talk about it anymore
Why?
I don't want to, I don't want some boy
comes here and finds out I'm cripple
I swear to God Yalda if you call yourself cripple again
I’d hit you on the head with this to make you nuts too
People have all kind of faults and flaws and they
Cover them in a way like they’re nothing
you have all these good qualities, and you only worry
about what?, that you shuffle you're feet?
Come and take these too
- You have his song tape?
- His what?
The tape of his voice
You have it?
The tape...
no
Yalda, do you know what bothers me
The most at the times when we’re expecting guests?
This crappy couch really bugs me
It embarrasses us completely
if someone comes in, he’d think he’d
entered a junkyard
Damn you!
I’ll change it one day
It is not that bad
Let me bring the food and then
Tell me all the details
That was the whole thing, I told you everything
Sara, what’s your opinion?
It’s the same price everywhere or is it cheaper in YaftAbad?
You only want this model?
Yes, I want it to be unique
You're not a stranger, you know that I can't change my house
But a couch is something that catches the eyes
- I want when this boy comes in...
- his eyes pop out of his head
Don’t be silly, I’ve seen a single couch too
And it’s really beautiful
It’s chocolate-colored with a lot of drawers under it
For bed sheets and quilts and stuff, it could be a bed too
Why do you need a bed in your living room?
You can't tell your son-in-law to go out in the middle
Of the night when he’s watching TV series
And you can’t allow him to go to the girl’s room
When they’re not engaged yet
I need to have a place so I could tell him
“please stay over tonight”
Aw, nothing still happened
And you’ve started to spoil your son-in-law
Your son-in-law is like your son, no difference
Give me that address
I’ll give you the address but
please let it be between me and you only
Why, is it illegal?
No, look, you pay a small amount of money to the company
And buy whatever cosmetics you want
Then you call your neighbors and sell these
Cosmetics To them With thirty percent profit
- It’s a kind of marketing
- why don't people buy these from the company directly?
That’s what I mean, if you give this address to others
Then we’ll have a lot of competitors, don't you want to
Pay the first installment of your couch?
I can't pay the full price now
Then go buy the amount of 50 thousands tomans
And you call your neighbors
They’ll Buy them with higher price
If you only call Susan, she’ll buy half of it
With that face of her, she needs sixty different types of face powders
And lipstick to be able to come out of her house
Now Give me that address
Would you Swear to your life that you won’t tell anybody?
Aw, Don't make me swear to my life for an address
- alright ,alright, I’ll give it to you at lunchtime
- thanks
Kids, Sara made a copy of that song
I really liked
But please Don't laugh
this is an old song


Father
Father
I just realized you don't call me grandpa anymore
I you needed a father, why didn't you come to me?
Why should my son rely on Skiiper and not me?
Yes, I'm your father
Why didn't you come to those who really love you?
You don't know what love means, it’s just a ridiculous word to you
You seems to have a good memory too
What did you need in your life that I didn't buy for you?
You can't buy love with money, you’ve paid
one million dollars for these junks, do they love you?
You think I bought them for who, for myself? this house
My money, all of these, these are for you
I don't want anything
What an excitement these people have in their movies
They cry, they laugh, they lose each other
They find each other
I don't know, they’re living
And look at us, wasting our time from morning to night
In that stupid warehouse
That useless stupid warehouse!
That swamp!
And look to whom I'm talking!
You're not talking, you're yakking
Look Ehsan, seize the moment
What do you want right now?
- Right now?
- Yes, right now
- nothing
- what do you mean nothing?
You really make my sick
Stop lying down, Come on, sit
- Lift your chair
- don't, please don't bother me Reza, it has nothing to do with you
I'm just sleeping so my blood circulate in my head
You’ll be more mixed-up if your blood reaches your brain
Come on, sit
my god
Not that you know what you want
Of course I know, a giant hamburger with French fries
It’s impossible to have a serious talk with you
It’ll take half a day or a little
more or less for me to reach the Bandar
They’ll give me food there
And a place to stay
He said “no problem, I guarantee to get you across the border”
Davood Najafi?!
yes
He guarantees to smuggle people across the border?!
Your drink, Mr.Ehsan
Well, People make progress, don't just look at us
Hello
I'm fine, how are you?
At fast-food restaurant
- No, I'm with someone who is about to be passed across
 the border. It’s guaranteed of course
- who is it?
I called him a couple of times too
Shut up, bastard
okay
Let’s see what happens
Keep me posted
Yalda
- Do You know where mom has put my film magazines?
- no
I'm sure she’s taken them
This is volumizer and emollient for the skin
And you know what else is in there...?
In it... well in its catalog...
You touched my stuff again?
- There is calendula in it...
- I can't put a few things of my own in this house?
- It has the durability... the perpetuity...
- I'm talking to you, it’s like you're not listening at all, huh?
- And it says “out of ninety people who have used this, each one
of them has said to has become younger after using this product”
- where are my film magazines mom?
Hello?
- What do you want? She hung out
- to hell with that
I'm telling you those few film magazines
of mine had nothing to do with you
where did you throw them?
They weren’t a few, they were two hundred
Two hundred is not a few?
No, a few means one or two
Besides, you've read so much nonsense about films
And cinemas and that has made you crazy
I don't want to pile up stuff that
have made my son crazy in my house
You have problem with that?
In your house?
Excuse me but who’s paying the rent of this house?
I'm working like a dog and all of a sudden this is your house
Okay Ehsan, you're right, whatever
You're always like this, everybody who’s similar
To you is sane, and everybody who’s not is insane
Watch your mouth
Yes, you're calling the neighbors to sell them lipsticks,
working overtime instead of your colleagues to collect money
and buy couch
Lest, god forbid the Mr.
son-in-law sits on an old couch Someday
I want to know if this girl goes anywhere except
To the end of this street
You’re both behaving weird
But I'm insane!
I'm a weirdo Ehsan?!
I said behaving wei...
Why do you put words in my mouth?
I said you're behaving weird
Aha, but you that fool around in cinemas all day
And toss and turn in your bed and speak in your sleep
All night...
And even couldn't get a promotion from that freaking warehouse
In these three years... you are sane
But I'm insane just because I sell lipsticks
Look, I wish somebody kicks me out of that damn warehouse...
I'm talking to you
You think I'm in love with my job
I wish someone hit me on the head with a crowbar when I'm sleep
At night so I wouldn't have to go there the next morning to sign
Entry and exit lists again
- Why are you acting like this?
- because I like to act like this
Do I have to forget about anything I like because of
Monthly salary of 300 thousand Tomans?
I want to write
You know I can write
But your lives don't let me move.
I feel stifled
Where?
To the cinema
You're lying
Yes, I'm lying
I'm going to the opium den, I'm a junky
And I'm going to commit some crimes
Didn't you know that mom?, I used to hide a machine gun between the
Pages of my magazines and I used to kill people till morning
And then go back to the opium den in the morning
And to make myself incognito
I put fake mustache
Eh, where is my fake mustache, mom?
Now you see, now you know why I speak in my sleep
Because a mafia group is after me and they want
To blow up our house with dynamites
But it’s okay, after we die and so that we wouldn't get bored, you can tell the story of your twenty suitors and tell us how much they have left
for their wives
In those villages of Kurdistan
Let me tell you something mom
One is better to be dead than being insane while thinking he’s sane
Hello, Nahid, I don't know what happened the phone cut off
My hand touched it or something
That’s okay, I looked around and I found its catalog
I read in it that it has sixty-nine percent brightness
And seventy-nine percent skin age-reducing quality
Yalda
yes
Would you go to buy cheese or should I go myself?
I'm coming, I'm getting ready
I’ll be late
- Hurry up
- I'm coming
Didn't the doctor tell you not to walk with short step,
Walk with long step to loosen up your legs’ muscles
But he’s not a doctor mom, it’s just you who call him a doctor
- If you had paid 10 thousand Tomans for his fee, you
Would’ve called him a doctor too
- talk with her
Watch out for the stairs, be careful not to fall
- hi
- hi
I wasn’t feeling good last night
I said something I shouldn't have
Stop frowning mom
Give me a kiss
Don't be silly, get off!
Why did you say you go to the opium den at night?
I was in a bad mood, I said something without thinking
I was talking nonsense
Do not ever make a joke about you being a junky
Okay, I don't know why you're always expecting that
My father’s illness afflicts me too
Come, drink some milk, it’ll soften up your bowels
My dear
You’ve had problem with that since you was a kid
Sit, I want to talk to you
Look my son, you know your sister very well
She doesn't nag or complain or something like that
She keeps all her sorrows to herself
I'm a mother, I can see it in her eyes
I went to her room the other night I saw her
Crouching and crying in the corner of her room
Why?
I asked the same question from her
I asked “why are you crying?”
She said “for my brother”
For me?
She said “Ehsan is wasting away in this house”
who said that to her, mom?
She thought about it herself
My child has been always sensitive
And I’ve always had problem with my bowel movement!
Get to the point
Get up for a moment mom
I know you're wasting away in that warehouse
You want to do so many things, you want to go everywhere
You want to buy so many things
It’s a necessity at your age, but you can't
I'm a mother, I understand that
You're chained to me and your sister
What can we do?
I can take care of myself
But what about your sister?
You can't do anything as long as she’s not settled
You can't go anywhere
You're stuck with your sister, you're stuck with Yalda
And all she do is going to the grocery for ten minutes each day
And then coming back to the house reading magazines and keep
Cleaning and washing her glass figurines
Ehsan, if you don't help your sister, we will lose her
What should I do for her, mum,
What should I do?
Nothing, just don't be so indifferent
I'm late
Do something for your sister
There isn’t a suitable young man in that big warehouse?
No, there isn’t
There is if you care about your sister’s future
Stop it, mom
We don't have high expectations
An average person like yourself would be good
He just shouldn't smoke, that’s it
Invite him to our house one night
What’s wrong with that?
maybe Yald don't like him
And if she do, that’s even better
You’d Be introducing two young people to each other
I’m going to change the couch, that doesn't mean
The house will be like a palace after that
But at least it will be less crummy
And when this boy comes, it wouldn't put him off
Listen to me, for your sister’s sake
mom
hi
What's happened?
What was wrong with Ehsan?
We had a fight over the color of the couch
He says “why do you want to pay so much
money for a chocolate-colored couch”
“Let’s buy an almond-green one”
But Chocolate-colored is much nicer
You expect good taste form men?!
Take this to the table, dear
How’s your leg?
It’s fine
-I want to record, sing
- let’s start over
Day and night with passion...
...and joy, like a love bird my heart flies
You don't understand
You jerk don't understand
You see that he’s not in a good mood...
Why do you Keep making fun of him
Can't you see ...
Get up, what’s happened to you?
I'm fine
Get back your work, don't stay here
go
- You too go wash your face
- I'm fine
- Look, look at his face
- stop it
Sissy
Jackass
- You want me to beat your block off?!
- don't answer him, stop it
- look at him, that jerk
- I’ll...
- go inside
Keep your head up, it may go to your eye
Ouch. What hurts me more is that
This jackass hasn’t even passed first grade
He can't even read
And he makes fun of my writings
Ouch, what is this, it burns
easy
You're so touchy
He’s making fun of you because he’s illiterate
He just wants to pick on others
So he forgets his miseries
Why do you attack him?
I didn't expect it from you
I just couldn't stand it
So, your artwork is ripped now?
Read it, I want to know what you had written again
Maybe he was right in making fun of you
I had brought this rice for you
The young woman kept trying to assuage her middle-aged sister
She tried to talk to her and made her aware of her surroundings
But her sister looked at her the way crazy people usually look
She kept saying somebody is going to take her to a long journey
The only thing She was talking about was about the type of clothes and
necklaces she had decided to wear for this magical journey
She was looking for her favorite purple-colored clothes
And for her turquoise-colored necklace
With delicate silver margins


- mom
- mhm
I invited him
Who?
Didn't you say I want someone to knock on this door
And comes in?
And you invite that someone
Well, yes, I invited him for dinner
And he accepted?
He wishes
Ehsan, you’re talking crazy again or
You're serious?
What crazy talk?!
Didn't you say “for Yala’s sake”?
You seriously invited him and he’s coming for sure?
yes
When?, if you're telling the truth
Tomorrow night
Oh god! Didn't you think I need to prepare for this
- Preparing for what? He’s an easy-going type of guy
- easy-going!, why didn't you call when you invited him?!
And you're lying around here since morning
And didn't say a word
But it’s okay, I’ll take care of it
I’ll make to types of food, stew and soup
And I don't make jelly, because I don't want him to
Think that we feel intimidated by him
Not at all, you're actually very calm!
OH god! Ehsan!
You're talking to the god or to Ehsan
I swear to god if this boy comes here tomorrow and sits on
This crappy couch I will be dying of embarrassment
And in order to avoid that, I’ve paid
The remaining of the first installment of the couch
They’ll bring the couch tomorrow
- really?
- yes
Okay, so I’ll take a tablecloth from Mrs.Shirazi
And I will have some time tomorrow to clean the house
My dear son, you’ve become so kind.
Drop your leg
- What’s his name?
- Reza
Does he smoke?
No, he’s not a junky
Ehsan, the other day you went off without listening to me
I was going to tell you that Yalda talked to me about one of your friend
Invite him
I invited the same person
Did Yalda tell you something?
- No, I...
- did she talk to you?
No mom, I’ve heard Reza’s voice on tape
from Yalda’s room several times
Do you think I don't understand anything?
Ok, never mind
how can you be sure he doesn't smoke?
He’s my friend, right?
He would smoke in front of me if he wants
If one wants to cover up something, he’d do it
Just as you hide your smoking from me
And it’s clear that you didn't find out!
Whatever, I don't want to give my daughter to a junky
Giving your daughter to a junky!
You’ve started the wedding already!
You said invite him for dinner just one night
And I invited him for dinner for one night, that’s it
- how much does he make?
- his income is like mine
So, it’s not a lot
Look mom, he’s coming here tomorrow night
But he doesn't know anything about Yalda
- You think I'm a child?!
- no, I'm just saying be careful
I just hope he wouldn’t be too handsome
So Yalda would be able to pull herself together
No, he’s so ugly
What?!, you mean we can't even show him to our relatives
No, he’s fine, he’s average
His face, his hair, his body, his future, his everything
Average is good?
Yes, it’s good, average is good
Yalda, dear, are the clothes dry?
Yes, you want me to take them down?
No my dear, I take them down myself
- mom
- yes
Look, About tomorrow...
Take it easy on Yalda
She’s not like others, she can't do well under pressure
- What do you mean?
- I mean we love her so much that sometimes we forget she’s disabled
I told you a hundred times don't call my child “disabled”
No, I know, it’s just I look around myself
She’s not like other girls
Yes, she’s different from other girls
Because she’s innocent, she’s a lady
No, I know, I wanted to tell you something else
She’s kind of shy, timid
She can't say a word in front of four people
Her glassy dolls are all her life
You can see it yourself, right?
I wouldn't blame others if they call her “abnormal”
How dare they to call your sister “abnormal”
I wish all the girls be like your sister
Ok, forget about these things now
When will this couch arrive?
Tomorrow
That’s all I wanted to hear, my dear
Grandma used to say “God grants all your wishes
If ask him at the times you are about to sleep”
I have no wishes mom
But I want the welfare of you and your brother
You get married, Ehsan gets married
Then, you hug your chubby daughter
put aside your crutch in the yard
And move across the yard for me
And when I'm retired
I’d stay one day at your house
A few days at Ehsan’s house
Why do you treat us differently?
One day at my house and a few days at Ehsan’s?
Well, because People would say she has son
But she’s staying at her son-in-law’s house
Our Girls belong to other families (an old saying)
I'm so tired, mom
Sleep my dear
Throughout my life I always hated poverty
This is the truth, my dear
You have no idea how difficult it is to respect some
People just because they are rich
I can kill you with this club
- You still blame me for skipper’s death
- you know I can kill you with this club
- Oh my god, do you think I’d be upset if you do that
- skipper and I were friends, why didn't you let us to continue
Our friendship?
- You need to hear me out
- but I don't want to listen
I need to talk to you but you never let me speak
I'm in love with you and it’s worth fighting for my love
Skipper isn’t worth it, he wasn't a good person
Maybe I'm not a good person too, nobody is good
But, look, skipper is dead
And I'm alive
- Maggie!
- Maggie the cat is alive
I'm alive, why are you so afraid of hearing 	the truth?
The truth?!
- Hello
- Hi
- One kilogram stew vegetables
- okay, sure
You can't select the good ones
I didn't, I just put the bad ones aside
Make it two kilograms please

- Thanks
- thank you
Yalda dear
Yala
What are you doing in there for 2 hours?
Why are you so pale my dear?
You’re flustering me
I'm doing what?
Come and sit on this chair for a minute
You’ve been busy preparing for something lately, you’ve
Changed the couch and...
- It’s like something is going to happen
- I don't want anyone see you like this
You need to put something on your face
- Girls need to be beautiful
- what is this mom?
I told you before I can't wear high-heel shoes
I'm not used to them, they hurt me
I’d fell down with them
Why on earth should I wear them?
Let me be honest with you
Because you’re short, sweety
Quick, Get yourself ready, Mr.Reza is coming any moment
Reza! What do you mean mom?
Oh my God
I totally forgot to tell you that Ehsan has invited whom
Reza
You mean that Reza, Ehsan’s friend in the warehouse?
God knows I didn't tell him anything
He found it out himself
He came to me one day and said he has invited Reza
What you did was so wrong, mom
I confided to you
I can't
I just can't come out
What do you mean you can't?
You’re not supposed to do anything
Yalda
I swear to god if you’re going to act stupid and embarrass me
I’ll never say your name again
Open this door
You come out like a grown-up girl
Say hello, eat your dinner
We tell each other two jokes, narrate two stories
And that’s it, the party’s over
That’s it
Understand?
I'm feeling sick mom
I'm also sick of what you do
But I swear to my life, I won't let you
Let me down this time, Yalda
Look, I don't tell you anything else
But if you love your mother
pull yourself together and come out
- Hi mom
- Hi, please come inside Mr.Reza, welcome
- hi, how are you?
- Ehsan dear, why did you arrive so late?
- we had some work on the warehouse
What are you waiting for Reza? Come inside
I’ll bring the tea for you in the patio
Why in the patio?
It’s just because of the food’s smell inside the house.
I’m opening the windows now
Then I’ll call you
- Yalda, get up and come out, I'm not joking with you
- you're crushing my arm, mom
- You Come out and sit down in the living room without saying a word
- I’ll scream if you don't let go off my hand
Scream and I’ll scream too
Let’s see whose voice is louder
What happened?
Why don't you scream?
Your mother really went to a lot of trouble
I'm not a stranger guest
Maybe she likes to do that, it has nothing to do with you
She just like the guest
Who’s this singer?
I don't know
- Reza, I talked with the manager today, I said...
- what a great voice he has
I'm talking to you, I told him
I come to work until the end of this month
Are you with me?
Yes, that guy, Davood najafi
The one who guaranteed to get you across the border
Yes
There are lots of Iranians oversees
Working in field of movies and ads and things like that
I’ll go write some stuff for them
And slowly something good happens
I’ll be better off
How do you know that?
Hum?
I said how do you know you’ll be in
A better situation
Any situation would be better
Than the situation I'm in right now
You don't seem have a common sense
Thanks for your insult
- Ehsan, come inside, it’s cold out there
- my mom doesn't know anything about this
Be careful not to blow it
You're blowing it with your whole figure
and you're worried about me?
Let’s go inside
You go, I’ll come in a minute
I’ve been here before a couple of times
But you weren't here
I'm kind of busy
And Yalda is always in her room doing research
And study and these kind of stuff
But tonight’s dinner is made by Yalda
Very thanks to her
If I’d known you’d go to a lot of trouble,
I wouldn't have come at all
Don't mention it, to me you are like Ehsan
Would you like tea?
No, thanks, I just eat this tangerine
Bon Appetite
Thanks
Please eat candy
Sure, thanks
Yalda
Yalda
Come here for a minute 
I'm fine, I'm okay
You needed to start walking right now?!
She was cooking since morning
I think her blood pressure has dropped
No, I think the carpet is rolled-up there
She tripped over it
when I was coming in I was about to fall down there too
Right
Hah?
How did you get so tall all of a sudden?
Huh?
It’s mom’s fault, she has bought these Cinderella shoes for me
She gets mad if I don't wear them, I can't even walk with them
She gave you her necklace too
yes
Yalda, come to table and eat your dinner
just as you do always, As if Reza is not here
As if it’s only the three of us
ok
If you are not comfortable, go to your room
Reza is not one of those guys who gets offended by that
ok
Are you okay?
Should I be worried about you?
I'm fine
Oh God, why on earth should we have power-cut right now?!
Ehsan, go and see if the fuse jumped?
- we’re so sorry, Mr.Reaz
- No, it’s okay
We can light candles
You have candles?
- yes, Yalda, show Mr.Reza where the candles are
- sure mom
This is so embarrassing, I tried so hard for the “Fesenjoon”
To have a nice color, and the power must go right now!
Everything is embarrassing to you,
How exactly does power-cut embarrass you?
he is really a good boy, Ehsan
He is so thoughtful too
He’s looking for candles with Yalda
- Did you check on the fuse box?
- I’ll go
- Go now, all neighbors have electricity
- mom
- excuse me, do you have match here?
- yes
Did you find the candles
Yalda found a few
You usually don't put matches inside your pocket?
No, why?
Nothing, just wanted to know, that’s all
Come inside, Ehsan come
Please come Mr.Reza
You haven’t paid the electricity bill yet?
No, not yet
Give it to me
I’ll pay it myself
- You're such a scatterbrain, you’ll forget again, give it to me
- I’ll do it myself Reza, I don’t have it with me right now
You are nuts
hi
Hi
How are you?
Sorry for the last night’s trouble
No, what trouble? My mom had made the dishes
Is Ehsan at home?
I was supposed to pick him up
But he doesn't answer my calls
He has left his cell-phone here
Aha, in case you’ve heard of him
can you tell him to call me?
Sure, I’ll tell him to call you
Yalda, what's wrong?
He’s going to cut the tablecloth
Hold on a sec
- How much is it?
- six thousands and eight hundreds (tomans)
This is ninety in ninety as you said
Mom, just one thing
Reza came here
When?
Should I cut the cloth?
After you went to the factory
What did he want?
Well, He was looking for Ehsan
They were supposed to meet each other
But Ehsan had left
He didn't come inside, right?
Inside?
No, do you think I'm a child?
- Well, what did he say?
- He thanked you for the last night dinner and that’s it
So, he didn't believe you had made the dinner
Yalda, didn't he say anything about you?
Mom, I gave him the tape
The one Ehsan has recorded with him
Well, well, did you tell him you listen to his voice
A hundred time everyday?
No, you know what happened?
He came up, I told him to come up
I told him to come up because Ehsan had left his cell here
I thought if you call him and he doesn't answer
You’d get worried
So he’d give it to Ehsan in the factory
I thought about you
Then I gave him the tape
But I forgot to give him Ehsan’s cell
This thing is all mixed up
What did I say the number is?
Seventy eight?
You want me to measure it again?
Yalda my dear
Your voice is shaking
What should I do now?
Let me measure the shelf
Or do you want me to measure them all again
Because they’re all mixed up
It’ll be done very soon
Yalda, what are you doing?
I’ll call you later, tell him not to cut them
I’ll call you
How come you're here?
Weren't I supposed to pick you up at your house?
Suddenly I decided to come out
And settle up with them
I have to take this list
You have pen?
Next time you decide to go somewhere suddenly
Take your phone too, so we can find you
I didn't know they’d cut it off so soon

Otherwise I’d paid the bill myself
It wasn't a lot
Remind to pay you up
Where are you going now?
I need a few more signatures and then it’s done
Where are you going after that?
I don't know
- Day and night, with passion...are you recording?
- keep singing...
- don't record
- I want to record
- okay then, let me start over
- sing
Day and night with passion and joy
like a love bird my heart flies
To every corner of this world
In the hope that it may see the face of my love
Light as morning breeze, it...
- Yalda
- yes
- Where is that big tray?
- in the patio, on the bed
Couldn't you sit there and drink your tea?
No, because the Koko wasn't ready
- Is it ready now, can I take it?
- No, I still haven’t add salt and pepper
- Oh god!
Mom, there is crack in this glass
Reza, you haven't eat anything yet
Eat something
- I ate a lot, thanks
- at least eat that candy
sure
75 minutes of the game passed, and still zero-zero draw
Ehsan, get up and break these walnuts on the patio
Before the downstairs neighbor start complaining about the noise
I’ll go in a minute, mom
Get up now
- This is an extraordinary game,...
- give them to me, I’ll do it
- an opportunity for Chelsea and Goal!
- No way, I don't let you...
- why?
- No, you're a guest here
- come on, let me do it
No, I pick out the nut in a whole
- Ehsan knows how to do it, get up Ehsan
- I can do that too
- But it’s a trouble for you
- it’s no trouble at all
No need to go the patio
I think our downstairs neighbors are not at home
If you want, you can do it here
- Even better
- thanks a lot
Ehsan
A yellow card for wayne rooney
What’s wrong with you again?
What are you doing mom?
Want am I doing?
An opportunity for Manchester united...
I'm so sorry to get you into this trouble
No, it’s no trouble
did you see Yalda’s glass figurines
The previous time you were here?

- no
- there are a lot, the rest are in her room
There are nice, right?
Yes, there are nice
These are small, you can't see them from this distance
Come here a take a close look
Okay
She’s been collecting them since she was a child
There’re so cute
Please sit
Look what a good taste she has
They’re shining
She’s polishing and cleaning them non-stop
Yes, they’re clean
she has a great interest in them
Ever since she was a child
She’d love it when somebody compliments them
If you want You can also
tell her how much you like them
Mm, You can ask her for example “for how long you have them?,
Who gave you those the first time?”
Things like that
You know better than me
Yalda

Don't forget to tell her they’re so clean
You said it yourself they’re shining
Yalda, my dear, where are you?
Mr.Reza wants to ask some questions from you
Yalda
Yalda, dear
Chelsea is all defensive and
Manchester is all attack
Go inside, Mr.Reza has some questions
He’d like to ask you
I made him to break walnuts
And I'm terribly sorry for that
Sit down here dear
- You’re welcome
- thanks
- Why are you taking these?
- It’s enough
But I just broke four of them
It’s fine, four is enough
But they’re crushed, I couldn't pick them out in a whole

It’s okay, I’ll pour them into the Koko
These are so beautiful
These are your favorites that you
Washed them
No, their turn for bath-time is every-other-day
I don't treat them differently
Yes, they’d complain if you do that
yes
They’d complain
Then we’ll have our work cut out for us to calm them down
Right
I was kidding
Do you really think I speak to them?
yes
Well, I too...
One would even speak to doors and
walls when he’s feeling down
You speak seriously
everyone does that
each person thinks he’s different from others
But we are all the same
You know, I don't go out at all
I don't go anywhere, I'm always here
Because these things make sound
And people look at me in a way...
That makes me feel bad, these crutches...
I'm fine, I'm... I'm just not used to talking to people
I’ll be okay
I'm fine
Would you get upset if I laugh?
At me?
Hum
Why?
You make a big deal out of this small problem
This is funny
You don't go out because of the crutch’s sound?!
Look, if you want you can put aside the crutch
Why shouldn't you go out?
To tell you the truth, you're so different from
the girls I know
You know a lot of girls?
Not that I know them completely
But I see them
Let me tell you something honestly
Tell me
One need to be so lucky to live with a girl like you
really
- So, then you laughed a lot huh?
- well, yes,...I mean, no
It happened so suddenly
I started singing and Ehsan recorded
Look at this
You're like my sister
This is my fiancée
We’re going to get married next month
This one
This
What happened?
Yalda
Yalda
Sorry, I have to go
Eh, Mr.Reza, where are you going?
Ehsan
Where did Reza go?
I don't know, he left suddenly
And this girl’s locked herself in
Yalda
Yalda dear
Yalda, open the door
- Call this boy, see where he’s gone?
- I'm calling him
- Yalda
- Yalda
This door is closed too, what if something happened to her?
- What are you talking about mom...
- open this door
- Yalda
- Yalda dear
- Open this door
- I can't break it down
- break it down
- Why are you yelling?
- what yelling?!, I want to know where my child is
- Yalda
- Yalda
- mom
- yes dear
- Reza is getting married
- let him get married, dear
I want to go to the bathroom
Ehsan
dear
You're going after Reza to ask him to come back?
no
- where are you going, then?
- to the cinema
Fuck this cinema that made you to make fun of 
Your mother and sister like this
Mom, I didn't know he’s getting married, don't start again
Yes, I believe anything you say!
You got to know all things about each other in these two years
- But you didn't know he’s getting married?
- no
You thought to yourself “let’s just
invite somebody To shut my mom’s mouth”
You didn't think about me, at least
You should have thought about your poor sister
I didn't know mom
And besides, the one who doesn't think about Yalda is you
I work like a dog all day
Because I think about you and your sister
And this is the result of your thinking
Today, just today, I told you a hundred time
I told you “don't do it, she can't bear it”
You didn't listen, you did the opposite
You said that because you knew your bastard friend
These days, healthy boys don't get married to healthy girls
Let alone the cripple ones
Shut up, shut up your mouth
I know what to do to your friend
I’ll make him pay for this
- why?
- why!
Can't you see?
Yalda my dear
- Mom, did Reza know we invited him so he proposes to Yalda?
- Yalda, darling
- He simply thought he’s invited just for one dinner
- come out darling, let’s see what happened
Mom, The one who needs to pay for this is you
Because you're driving us crazy with your own behavior
- mom
- yes dear
I saw the picture of Reza’s fiancée
- she’s a good girl, ok?
- ok
But Reza said he’s going to break up with her
He said because he and I are very suited to each other
But I'm thinking about this poor girl,
is it really fair to her?
Darling, you calm down, you don't need to worry
About her...
Why is Ehsan looking at me like this?
No, he’s looking normal, darling
Does he think I'm lying?
No darling, why should you lie?
Let’s go, I’ll make some food for you
And then you eat them
After that you sleep
Mom, I take the phone to my room
Reza is going to call
- I can't talk to him when Ehsan is listening
- I’ll bring the phone for you
I’ll take it, I’ll take it myself

You know how we can save ourselves
from all of these miseries, mom?
You make a delicious food one night
And then when the time is right
We seal up all doors and windows
And one of us opens the gas valve
Then we sleep
Before dawn, all our miseries are gone
The young boy was thinking to himself how much
He becomes like his father at those moments
As if escaping from life was something he had inherited
From his father
He had a strange feeling
He wasn't sure if he actually
Had come out of that house that night or not
12 p.m. Bandar-Abbas Passengers
Can board now
Successive events were so simple and meaningless
That he couldn't realize
Which one is real and which one is just a product of his mind
He had a feeling that he had lost something
But he was sure about something
That he would never come back to that house
He would never sit down on that living-room couch
And think about escaping
This was the only thing that could have made him 
able to distinguish between reality and illusion
Ahvaz, Ahvaz
Yalda
darling
Yalda
My dear
What's happened Yalda?
Oh god!
Ehsan
12 p.m. passengers of Bander-Abbas
Please board now

Ehsan
My dear
Yalda is not feeling good
Come back to us
Ehsan, talk her into eating a few bites
Okay
I’ll get time-off from work
To be here for lunch
I’ve also put a chicken outside
In case she wants to eat something
My supervisor has been very cooperative in these two-weeks
It’d be great If we could work every-other-day
This way every day one of us can be with her
You didn't say anything to them about
your sister’s condition, did you?
no
I told them my mother is sick
You did the right thing
I don't want their tongues wag about your sister
Ehsan, make her eat
Come on Yalda
Eat this
Eat this my dear

Yalda
Yalda dear
Yaldaee
Wait, wait a second
Wait a second, give that to me
My dear, just a second
Take this
Take
Eat this
Just this one
Look at me
Look at me for a second
Yalda
Look at me, just this one
You need to eat something
For my sake
Bravo
It’s okay, it’s okay
Don't eat if you don't like

You know what I’m going to do?
I’ll get another one for you
the dates of the every single day
you got money from me
Here it is, I wrote them all
You got the money but you didn’t punch in my card
They’re firing me because of the mess
You caused
And when I ask you why you did this to me
Instead of saying you're sorry, you're barking like a dog
I told you several times
I need to take care of someone
Who’s not in a good condition
That’s the reason I couldn't cover for you
in these few days
I got a small amount of money from you
Because I needed it and I’ll give you back all of it
And by the way, dog is you and your whole family
What is going on here? why are you yelling?
Get back to your work
what the fuck you're going to do
If I don't get back to work?
my life has been a living hell for the past fifteen days
and nobody said to me “how are you”
- What's happened?
- now you're asking?!
- Nobody ever said to me...
- If you don't get back to your work, I’ll have the security
Kick you out of the factory
Yalda
I'm talking to you, why did you pull this out
of your hand?
What do you want?
Huh?
You want to sleep here?
Sleep here, so I could insert this into your hand
Look my dear, this should’ve come down
To the bottom
Look where it is now
It has to come down here
This can't go on any longer
You don't eat
And you don't let this thing to be on your hand
Look what you’ve done to your hand, Yalda
I'm talking to you, you get weak this way
You won’t be able to stand on your feet
Why aren’t you listening to me?
I'm talking to you
Stop, stop it
leave it out, stop it
you're driving us mad
Ehsan
Do You have any cigarettes?
no
The other day when you were talking about sealing off
The windows
And opening up the gas valve
Did you really mean that?
No, I wasn't feeling good
I said something stupid
mom
mom
Wake up mom

Reza called, mom
He said he had broken up with his fiancée
He wants to come here tomorrow and talk to you
you and Ehsan
Mom, I'm starving
Let’s go eat something together
Ehsan
Yes dear
Did Reza’s call wake you up?
What?
What?
Ehsan
What is it mom?
- What is it?
- Ehsan
Yes, look mom, I’ll go find a good doctor for her
Tomorrow
- You just remain calm, okay?
- Ehsan
Go and warm up your sister’s food for her to eat
Sure
Ehsan
hi
I know you're upset with me
I called last night to talk to you
You called?
Yes, your sister picked up the phone
You called last night around one, two o’clock?
Yes, look, I need to talk to you
I can't do it here
I couldn’t talk to Yalda that day
When I started talking about my fiancée
She started crying and went to his room
I was afraid to look at your face
Given the state Yalda was in
I thought you might think badly of me
You know, Yalda is not like everybody else
She’s so sensitive
So kind
You rarely find people with these qualities these days
During these two, three weeks I decided several
Times to come and talk to you
But to tell you the truth, I didn't have the courage
The thing is, Ehsan invited me for dinner here one night
was it a right thing to do for me
To tell him “I like your sister”?
How could someone say
Such a thing to someone’s face?
It was my mother who had chosen my fiancée
In her gathering with other women
That girl
I don't want to say she was a bad person
She wasn't my type
We weren't suited to each other
That’s why I broke up with her
I want to ask for your and Ehsan’s permission to marry Yalda
If she wants of course
mom
Ehsan
What’s wrong with mom?
She’s not feeling good
I told her I'm going to the grocery
And she started kissing me
I tell her “why don't you go to work”
She says “I want to stay with you”
Are you okay?
Talk to her a little.
Look after her
I’ll go get some milk
Did you see how better she it?
I’ll go with her
If you want we don't tell her anything about Reza
For now
Huh?
She’s feeling better, isn’t she?
yes
thanks
You don't need to worry
I’ll take care of her
Just as you do
Thanks
We had gone shopping for the wedding this morning
I thought I’d be better to come back and prepare the food
While they look around the bazar
Congratulations
Where did you get the news?
Everyone in the factory knows about this
Well... that nosy crowd
Farideh, forgive me
I got so angry with you the other day
I had a fight with my husband that day
I made a mistake
You're like my sister
My dear...
All women chipped in and bought
Yalda a wedding present
And Mr.Torabi paid half of the money
- Who told them about Yalda’s wedding?
- me
Thanks a lot
I cursed all of them that day
Oh come on, take it easy
One would curse himself when he’s angry
Mr. Torabi asked to see you
In the factory
I have to go to the factory of course
I need to thank them
Those poor people are not in a better condition than me
- Here you are
- hi, congratulations
- thanks
- Here, please eat,
- Congratulations, thanks
- congratulations
Take two, she’s retired and also
her daughter’s getting married

Those who watch a movie twice, one after the other
May seem strange people
But you can't explain this feeling to anyone
When the characters of a movie are still
Living and breathing In your mind
You can stare into their eyes while they’re on the screen
You can talk to them
You can change their fates
This way you can render reality into dream
You can sink into the cinema’s chair
The moment the lights are off, a miracle happens
The moment you feel there is no way to escape
It’s only important that you carry on with all your power
Everything starts from this moment
