Nice guy, the boyfriend.
Photographer, I believe.
What ticked me off was the way 
she kept laughing while he talked.
Why did you leave her, again?
-You know, I got bored.
She called me, like, six months 
after you left her, to talk about you.
If you called her, she'd come back.
-That was the first plan.
It's fine seeing each other occasionally,
but I'd never come back to you. Never.
Don't even dream about it. 
It's never going to happen, 
understand the word 'never'?
Are you in love with him?
-Yes, I guess. I don't know.
At least he's not crazy like you, 
he has other interests, I don't know.
Are you going to finish with me?
You're crazy. You want me back because 
you can't stand that I have someone else.
Someone who's more handsome.
-No, he's not.
So you're saying I'm more handsome
and you're still breaking off with me.
Bye, handsome.
She doesn't want you back. So now what?
I don't know, I think he was with a guy, once.
When he told me, I thought he was definitely gay.
But no, it's not that. Pablo is very 
open-minded. He has no prejudice.
And that's good, right?
That you can try how it is with another 
guy and not mind, talk about it later.
Think about it.
I came up with Plan B.
No. You're lying. I don't believe you.
You're really going to do it?
-Yes.
You watch "Blind"?
-Yes, I'm a huge fan.
I never miss an episode. Well, I'm 
missing it today 'cause my TV is broken. 
Otherwise, I wouldn't miss it, ever.
You watch "Blind" as well? 
-Yeah, no.
No, I don't know anyone else who 
watches it, I swear. I can't believe it.
My girlfriend doesn't let me watch it.
-Why not?
She says I'm obsessed with it.
-It's such a great show. Really great.
I can't believe that you watch it.
People don't understand it.
No, they really don't.
I record all the episodes.
-Really?
Can I borrow today's episode?
I know that you don't know me and, 
despite everything, could I borrow it?
Sure.
-Cool, great.
If you'd like, you could come over 
and watch it at my place.
Today?
Yeah, sure. If you invite me.
Why "despite everything"?
What?
-You said "despite everything". Despite what?
Well, because ... I don't know 
that many people at the gym.
So I tried to, I don't know ... be nice,
and saw a chance to see "Blind" ...
I rambled something. I don't know.
What?
You remind me of myself when I think of 
something enthusiastic. Like that show.
I get a little crazy.
It's really good.
I'm going home.
-Why?
Why? Because I have to go. You have to 
watch a film for your class, right?
Yes, but you can watch it with me.
But today is the last episode, 
I have to see it, seriously. Please.
Besides, you're going to need the TV, right?
-Yes.
And that's OK. We both have our own 
place, our own space and stuff. Right?
I really have to see it, love. Give me a kiss.
-"I must see it, I must see it."
That makes me jealous.
-You're jealous of the show?
Yes.
But you're my only love. 
Give me a kiss.
Bye.
-Bye.
Come in. Want a drink?
I have only water.
-Good.
Are you French?
You're asking because of my accent 
or my appearance?
Why French?
-No, nothing.
My girlfriend has a picture of a French 
guy at home, that looks just like you.
Very strange, really.
When I saw you at the gym I thought you 
looked just like the guy in Laura's photo.
That's why I kept looking at you, 
at the gym. The French guy ... I thought.
Hey, it's about to start.
No!
-Nooo.
No, they can't leave it at that, 
sons of bitches.
No, now we must wait, like, 
four months, I can't believe it.
Just two weeks, but still.
Who was that guy?
-The contact.
No, no way.
-No. I want to die.
Good episode, eh?
-Yeah. I'm off.
We can watch it again, thanks to 
my girlfriend, who has to study.
She has her hands on the TV.
Did you send yours to be fixed?
You mean my girlfriend?
-No, your TV.
Yes.
We can meet again on Tuesday.
-Fine. That's good.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No, no. I sent her to be fixed,
but it was useless.
At one moment the moon appeared
and we got all excited.
We began to howl like wolves.
We climbed a hill, 20 meters high.
When we reached the other side,
the light was completely different.
It was ... unbelievable.
There were clouds that looked like 
horses, galloping. Incredible.
Look how beautiful the light is now.
Yes, it is.
What time is it anyway? 
Around 6AM, maybe?
-Perfect light for a photo, isn't it?
You're right. I'll be right back.
-OK.
Let's see. Turn around.
-No. 
Come on, stand still.
-No, no, I'm embarrassed.
I have no other model. Just like that, 
it's easy. The light is good.
Wait. You're going to take it for yourself,
you won't let anyone else see it?
Yes, yes, yes.
OK, that's enough.
-Just this one and we're done.
Show me, show me.
That one's nice, really nice.
Let me take one of you.
This one as well. See?
No, I don't like having my picture taken.
-What? Me neither, but you took 25 pictures.
No, no, I don't like it.
-Come on, give me the camera.
You know how it works?
-I press this.
Yes, and this allows you to focus.
-OK, I'll manage.
Take it.
-OK.
Here we go.
You can see the light?
-Yes, the light is fantastic.
Here it is. Look.
That's nice.
-It is.
It came out nice.
You're staying, right?
-Sure.
Are we going?
-Sure, let's go.
Bruno, here.
I'll grab a shirt for you.
Thanks.
Well, good night.
-Good night.
I had some photos taken the other day. 
They came out really cool.
Send me one.
-No, you threw them all away, so screw you.
You're such an arrogant prick.
Do you have any left?
-No.
Fine, when you get back with me,
you'll have as many as you like.
We're not going to get back together.
Sometimes I feel bad for Pablo.
-Your boyfriend?
Yes. 
He doesn't check up on you?
-No. I don't either. We trust each other.
Were you seeing another when we were together?
-You know I didn't.
Well, once.
It's different with you because
I don't feel guilty.
What are you thinking about?
Your boyfriend.
Nice photos.
-They really are.
But I don't understand how 
Laura won't see them.
The thing is, he doesn't like 
to show his photos to anyone.
He showed them to you and 
won't show them to his girlfriend?
I don't know. He said he wouldn't. If he 
does, that's it. That's the risk, right?
Poor guy.
He's placing all his trust 
on the wrong side.
And that's you.
-C'est la vie, what can you do.
C'est la vie. Have you 
touched it a little, or what?
No, but I saw it at the gym and
he's well-endowed.
Well-endowed? Lucky you.
You're such a fag. 
Give me some water.
Who is that?
My boyfriend. Do you like him?
-Don't be stupid.
Is he your friend or Victor's?
-He's my boyfriend, I told you.
Are you discriminating against gays?
-Asshole.
He's handsome.
-Beautiful.
You're not going to steal him 
from me, eh?
Pablo, this is Ana. Ana, this is Pablo.
-Hello. Everything good?
Good. And you?
-She doesn't believe that you're my boyfriend.
Well, we're not going to let 
everyone at the party know.
I just met her, I'm a little embarrassed.
Let's see: how did you two meet?
-At the gym, in the shower.
He was standing nearby and I got a boner.
-You are so gross.
Don't pretend you're polite, I know you.
Anyway, how big can it get 
if you're so small.
What?
-Your sister showed me a photo of you, naked.
I don't know him in a different context, 
but with me, he's pretty huge.
Did you get to know him?
-No, I have not had that pleasure.
Guys, I'm going to start believing 
that you're really dating.
-Of course we're dating.
Kiss him then.
-He wouldn't dare in public.
He's embarrassed.
Yeah, he's all macho to call you his boyfriend, 
but a sissy when it comes to giving you a kiss.
Bitch, you're insufferable. Challenging me now, huh? 
Besides, he's the one who wouldn't dare.
Of course. So this little game 
is going to end with a real kiss. 
We're really dating.
-Give him a kiss.
Soon you'll want us to 
suck each other off right here.
Calm down, fool, I barely know you. 
Give me some credit.
Still, I'd love to see it.
-Talk about trust ...
Obviously. Don't believe me?
-Watch.
Give me a kiss, dear.
You are truly a couple.
Do you take me for a fool?
Isn't he great?
Yes, and I'm getting excited.
I'll go get something to drink.
She's amusing, huh?
-Indeed. She's great.
It's been a while 
since I had such a laugh.
I have a dry mouth. 
I'm going to get some wine.
What the ...
Do you know what was cool 
when we were little?
I didn't have it, but my cousin did.
Rastri.
Rastis.
-No, Rastri. Not Rastis.
I think it was Rastis.
- No, no, Rastri.
You think it was Rastis, 
but it's Rastri.
All the same.
We can look it up.
-OK.
They were fun.
-Yes.
I used to build structures.
-Structures?
Yes, houses, airplanes, things. I don't 
know, stuff I imagined, whatever I wanted.
No, jerk.
If you could be a toy, 
what would you be?
What?
-It's that corny time of the day.
If I were a toy ...
No idea. Never thought about it.
-I would be a View-Master.
You look through it and change pictures.
The one with a button?
-Yes.
That's a good one.
-Yes.
For people to understand you, 
they have to see through your eyes.
For example, I see you in 3D.
So that's why you'd be a View-Master.
Cool.
And you? Come on, think of something.
No idea.
A bucket and a scoop.
-A bucket and a scoop?
I am a less sophisticated toy.
-Yes, that's true. How much is that?
I don't know, 20 pesos.
-20 pesos?
Why a bucket and a scoop?
Because you can fill yourself with things.
You can build with it.
I don't know.
That's good. It sounds very poetic.
Can I buy you?
I have an owner.
-What a bad businessman. I couldn't have known.
I want to compare ... Compare? Buy.
I want to buy you for 20 pesos.
Look.
Here.
Give it to me.
-Did I buy you?
Now I have 20 pesos. You lose.
-No, I won, don't worry.
Done.
Peter Pan.
Do you know him?
The one that ...
-Yes, Peter Pan, man. That one.
He can fly.
-He can fly.
Yes.
-Good.
Do you know where he lives?
-No.
You don't know where he lives?
In the land of ...
-Oh, the land of Never Again.
Never Again. Neverland. Good.
Tinkerbell lives there too.
-Tinkerbell ...
The problem with "Neverland" is that ...
"Neverland" means ...
"Never" is never.
-"Never" is never.
"Land" ...
-Country.
Country, yes. But 'land' also means
to set on land and there's the problem.
Get it? For me it's 
the Land of Never Landing.
That's the thing. If Peter Pan 
never lands in Neverland, 
it doesn't exist.
-You're right.
It doesn't exist.
So Peter Pan doesn't exist.
The name itself says it doesn't exist. 
Do you follow me?
He never landed in this country.
You understand what I'm saying?
-Yes, yes.
Of course.
So all our childhood we lived in a lie.
Yes.
-I just figured it out.
Son of a bitch, that Peter Pan.
Son of a bitch. It makes me furious.
It's like your whole childhood is
now ruined, in a way.
When did you discover this?
-Just now.
It's true. 
-He never landed, son of a bitch.
He is completely gone, huh?
-Yes.
But when he comes to life, 
he's huge. He's all dick
and no brains, but I'm happy anyway.
He was my sister's boyfriend before.
My sister. Bunch of whores.
Me, a whore? You're a whore. That 
thing at the party was so unconvincing.
If you really kissed him, I would have 
believed you. But you're a coward.
Do you want him to beat me up or what?
-He's dying for it. Right?
It could be, yes, yes.
-See? Come on.
You're not gay if you give another guy 
a kiss. I tongued with girls at school.
Yeah?
-It drove the boys crazy.
Would you believe that.
No, I have a girlfriend.
OK, give me a kiss.
But you're next.
Yes, yes, yes. 
-Come on.
I want, too.
-No, cheater. You have to kiss him.
Come on.
-Why me?
You have to kiss him now.
You're not going to die.
She's right. She kissed me, 
I could end up in jail.
When my boyfriend wakes up,
he'll kick your ass.
Don't challenge me, you'll lose.
Come on, for the girl.
-For the girl.
He's asking for it.
-It's all good, it's all good.
I'm not asking for it.
There.
Bruno, don't be such a sissy.
-I tried. What do you want?
You did the same thing at the party.
OK, come here. Give me a kiss.
I'm going to stroke myself a little now.
-Pervert.
See? Nothing happened.
They're asleep.
-Yes?
Let's go to bed. You staying?
-Sure.
Remember ...
... when we were little, like 12 years  
old, and had a friend sleep over ...
... after lights out you'd stay up 
all night, talking.
True, that was great.
You know what would be awesome?
Going back in time with a tape recorder
to record those conversations.
I'd like that.
See what our world was like then.
Let's go to the cinema 
one of these days.
Sure.
Where did that come from?
No idea. Free association.
Good night.
Good night.
And the pictures that were hanging here?
-They were old so I threw them away.
I liked those photos, they were nice.
You should have asked me.
-Hey, sweetheart, this is my house.
Let me decorate it the way I feel like.
Fine. I don't know, there's also 
some of my stuff here. Or not?
It's my semi-home.
You know, my girlfriend threw away 
the picture of your twin.
Why?
No idea. She simply threw it away. 
I don't know.
Did you tell her he resembled your friend?
No, no ...
I didn't tell her about you.
Nothing. I like to keep 
my friends separate,
at my side. And her ...
Besides, I have a special 
bond with you that ...
Like you said, the kind of friendship 
that you have when you're 12.
You don't want anybody 
stealing your friend.
I don't know, actually ...
It would be ...
If I took you there and the two of you 
talked ... I don't know, it would be strange.
I have my own space here. 
I don't know.
Does that make sense?
-Perfectly.
Are you going to stay over?
-In your bed?
Keep laughing, but Marino locked
the bedroom door and took the key.
You want me very close to you, huh?
-No.
Yeah, yeah. I'll sleep on the floor, 
it's all good.
I mean, it's alright,
you can sleep in my room.
OK, sure.
Would you like some wine?
-Yes.
That would be nice.
-Good.
I can't find my wallet.
Did I leave it at your place?
No.
I can't find it anywhere.
Well. It will reappear.
I'm gonna go get the wine.
What are we waiting for?
-Ana.
She's with her boyfriend, 
she's coming.
I've brought you a present.
Awesome.
You're great.
Awesome.
I had already bought one. Remember?
For 20 pesos. Much nicer.
Now I have two buckets with scoops.
Anyway, I'm inside. 
That's why I give it to you.
And I'm seizing the opportunity.  
If you were ...
-If I were what?
You're pulling another "if you were"? 
You're going to kill me with it.
You're overreacting.
If you were ... Oh, never mind.
-Come on, go on.
Suppose you were a mineral.
Something that was neither 
animal or human. What would you be?
Good question.
It can't be answered easily.
What would you be?
Water.
-Water.
Water is good. I would be sand.
Get it? Sand, the bucket ...
-Sand is good.
What are you doing here, sissies?
-Is it that bad?
Is something wrong? Are you mad?
His stick isn't working?
What is it?
-There's no toothpaste.
Could be.
Look at me.
Who is taller?
Stand still.
Keep still.
I am, you midget.
You shouldn't smoke here.
Well. You were saying?
Would you like a gum?
-No, thanks.
Take it, it's the last one.
You have to do me a favor.
I have a casting.
A casting? Liar. Since when 
are you involved in casting?
It's silly. 
They called me for a commercial.
They saw my photo I don't know where and, well, 
it was a good photo. They're paying 1200 pesos.
They're filming it in Ecuador.
-Really?
I need to kiss a guy
and I don't know what to do.
You kissed me the other day, 
when you were drunk. Don't you remember?
That was when I was drunk.
Are you kidding me? You are. Kissing 
is different from fooling around drunk.
Confused that with a kiss?
-No.
That wasn't a kiss. Besides, you have 
no idea what I was going to ask you.
To kiss you so you can practice.
-No.
Yes.
Just go and give the guy a kiss.
Kissing for practice is weird ...
If I did it, it would be 
because I like you.
Not to try it without being drunk.
But it's easier to say it than do it.
-But you would do it.
You would. It's rather easy to 
persuade you. You must really like me.
I'm just kidding.
Come on, give me a kiss.
I would do it, I would, because 
I like you. That's why. Besides ...
It's basically prejudice, that's what it is.
-Exactly. Come on, as a favor.
I don't remember the other day.
No ... I consider you a friend, 
we can't do it.
You're going to look back at this different 
kiss, and you're going to think I'm a fag.
And then I'll lose you as a friend.
No way. I'm not crazy.
I'm not asking just anybody. I'm asking 
you because I know it's going to be OK.
Anyway, I would have to be the fag 
in the end because I'm asking you.
You gave me a kiss already. Are you  
saying you can't give me another?
And then waht? Are we going to make 
it a habit, spend afternoons swapping spit?
Maybe.
This is a joke.
Come on. It's 1200 pesos.
I can't believe I kissed a guy.
-You better not tell anybody about this.
You'll be kissing another soon. You're 
going to be kissing a lot of men in the end.
Why somebody else?
-The casting.
It's strange, isn't it?
I've never kissed a guy.
Well, it's the second time.
And the same guy.
You never kissed another man?
Don't lie to me, sissy.
Yes, I just kissed you.
Why would I lie? Makes no sense. 
All the same, I imagined something different.
You've never been with another man?
What? You have?
-Yes.
But you never kissed a man.
-I did other things.
Without kissing.
When I was a teenager.
It's okay.
I haven't. I ...
It never occurred to me.
I never had an opportunity.
You're lying.
You don't believe me. 
You don't, whatever.
Liar.
Son of a bitch.
Are you OK?
-Yeah.
Are you really OK?
You're weird.
No. Everything is OK.
-Really?
This is for you.
Open it later.
Thank you.
-Yeah.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I love you / I want you, man.
I want you for myself.
Tell me.
Are you seeing someone else?
-No.
No, I'm not cheating on her. 
Not yet, anyway.
That's why I told her we should 
take a break.
I'm confused and I need to know 
what I really want.
Take it easy. I love you, 
you can tell me what's going on.
Remember when I told you that
I was once with a guy?
That was a lie.
-Idiot.
Yeah. I was never with a guy.
I guess I told you that because ...
it drew attention without much effort.
Now I'm a bit confused about 
a friend I met not long ago.
And I need to know what's going on.
The truth is, I don't want to hurt anybody.
-Of course not.
Take it easy. See what happens 
with the guy, what happens with Laura.
And nothing. Relax.
In the end, whatever you do, it's 
not going to change what should be.
And what about her?
-What?
Is she seeing someone else?
-Yes.
But don't feel bad, because 
she's been seeing him for a while.
Her ex, Bruno. She has a picture 
of him at her place, but ...
I didn't tell you anything because I
didn't want you to be jealous.
You know that wall 
where all those photos are?
The guy is a slug, he's crazy.
He's been obsessed with getting her back.
But, I don't know.
Bruno is the guy leaning against a wall,
with closed eyes? With the beard?
No, that's Paul, the French guy.
Bruno is the first.
Bruno is named Paul.
She had the names changed.
I didn't know that.
Don't tell her that I told you
'cause she's going to kill me.
So that's Bruno.
-Yes.
He knows you. He'd seen you together 
once and called me to ask about you.
He wanted to kill himself 
because he saw you together.
I'm going to make tea. Chamomile for you?
-Whatever.
I'll be right back.
Forgive me.
I need to be alone for a while.
I didn't want it to end like this, but ...
I don't feel well.
And I can't be of any use to you.
I'm sorry.
I'm seeing someone else anyway.
What do you mean?
-I'm not saying it to be vindictive.
I don't know why I said it.
I don't know ...
Maybe because it wasn't working.
Who is it?
An ex-boyfriend.
Well. I'm going.
Hi.
Did that letter confuse you much?
Sorry, that wasn't my intention.
Something similar is happening to me, 
with you.
Although there's something 
I don't agree with ...
... something you wrote in the letter.
That the sex between us would be ...
... I don't know, only half of ...
... of what we thought it would be  
or, say, what it was ...
... when we were kissing ...
And you, you stole 
kisses from me with excuses ...
... that made no sense.
And I'd like to see 
what would happen if ... 
... if we were really together. 
So suddenly? 
What can happen? It's our secret. 
There's nobody here, we're alone. 
Are you proposing sex? 
Yes. 
-That's weird. 
Why is it weird? 
Do you really find it weird? 
Did you or didn't you write that letter? 
My head is going to explode. 
Come. 
Come on. 
I need to go to the toilet. 
I love you too ... 
... but I can't. 
This makes no sense. 
I don't like guys. 
I may try it once ... 
... but it will not change. 
You know?
I'm sorry ... 
I mean it, forgive me. But ...
I thought about everything, 
but I know I don't. I know that ...
We're not 12 anymore. 
The situation got out of hand. 
I wanted to be modern. 
But no. I'm old-fashioned. I'm ... 
I have a girlfriend. 
And so ... 
Anyway ... 
I don't know. Everything is OK. 
We move on ... 
We can still be friends. 
Did you know that I was single again? 
Single? What happened? 
He left me.
-He left you?
Yes, he left me. He met another girl. 
Another girl? 
Yes, and I guess 
he fell in love with her.
Pity. 
Are you still thinking about  
getting back with me? 
Sure. 
Yes. But let's take it easy, OK? 
You've just broken up, maybe he'll come back. 
-I don't think he will. 
All good? 
All good. 
The guy found out 
about your little game. 
That seems impossible. 
Why? He took pictures of you, 
maybe he showed them to Laura. 
Still, Bruno, there's something 
I don't understand. 
You suddenly like men? 
I don't know, Victor. 
I can't explain what's happening to me. 
It just is.
I hope this never happens to you. 
My head hurts, 
I think about it all the time. 
Tell him everything. That letter was 
confusing. Tell him you're crazy about him. 
I don't know if it's luck that 
she didn't give a fart about him.
Yeah, I know. 
It's crazy. 
I don't even want to think about it. 
How do you feel? 
Better? 
-Yes, I don't know. 
I can't be with you. 
I can't be with anyone. 
When I saw you with another, I was 
jealous. And now that you're alone ... 
... I realise that I was jealous 
and I don't want to go back. 
We had a nice time, 
but now it's over, period.
I'm sorry. 
I told him that we were seeing each other. 
-Does he know me? 
I had a picture of your at home. 
I didn't throw away everything. 
That idiot Veronica went and 
told him it was you ... 
Anyway, don't worry. He left me. 
He won't go after you. 
If I were him, I would smash my head. 
You exaggerate. 
How are you?
-Hi. 
I don't know how, 
but it appeared at Javier's place. 
I wanted to give it to you. 
At Javier's? 
Have you looked inside? 
-No, man. 
So are you back with Laura? 
No. 
You? 
No, no. 
Why didn't you go back? 
-It wasn't right. 
It wasn't right? 
Yeah. I'm not in love with her. 
After all that effort. 
And why didn't you go back to her? 
Because I got confused with you, I guess. 
-Confused ...
I'm sorry. 
OK, I'm going. 
Look ... 
I wanted to say something ... 
I looked it up and it's Rastri, 
remember? 
Not Rastis. 
I wanted to tell you that ... 
... that ... 
... that I'm in love with you. 
I'm completely sick with love. 
I don't know how it happened. 
I couldn't control it. 
Look. 
These are the 20 pesos from back then. 
And have you seen this? 
Come on, sucker. 
Who's taller? 
THE END
