Sir, as per your instructions,
I have kept his body in the mortuary.
EXACTLY 18 DAYS AGO IN HYDERABADâ€¦
Welcome, everyone!
My brother, Sri. Nanda Gopal Chakravarthy,
established the People Mart company, where
fifty percent of its revenue is spent on
providing free education and medical care
to its employees at the corporate level.
Today, the Government of India
has recognized his services and
conferred on him the Padma Shri award.
As his younger brother, I feel proud.
Now my brother will speak.
Thank you.
Good morning, everybody.
Just like everyone else,
I once felt sad and wonderedâ€¦
"Why am I not successful?"
I was really sad.
Do you know what I have done
to attain success?
If you bury the seeds of a bamboo tree
and water it,
you won't yield anything the next day.
You won't get anythingâ€¦
even after a week.
Nothing after a month as well.
Not evenâ€¦
in a year.
But after three years, it will sprout.
And after that, we witness its growth.
Do you know what it does
in those three years?
The higher it grows,
the deeper it sinks its roots.
After getting success,
how much we want to rise,
depends on how much groundwork
we do even before we get it.
That groundwork
is the reason for the success.
Thank you.
That's why I believe
in growing step by step.
One thing I want to say to all
my People Mart family members.
I call you family members,
but I truly want
to make you all my family members.
But I don't know how.
I'm dying in two months.
I am suffering
from a Neurodegenerative disease.
Doctors gave me a maximum
of two months to live.
As the head of the family,
I felt it was my duty to tell you this.
I am living happily.
I want to die happily.
I am living successfully.
I want to die successfully.
Please, sir. Please.
Sir, I worked really hard
to build this company.
Sir, it's the result
of my 15 years of hard work.
Please ask him to spare me. Please.
Bro, at least you tell him.
Please tell him, bro.
Please ask him to spare me.
How can you beg like that?
He who cannot protect himself
can never be the king.
Am I right?
Those who have empty pockets want money.
Those who have money, want power.
And those with power, want the world.
A growing company is like a growing girl.
If you sit out lazing around like this,
someone will seize it.
Mr. Nanda Gopal Chakravarthy,
the recipient of the Padma Shri award,
declared that he would distribute 50%
of the shares in his company, People Mart,
to his employees.
I want to say something to my
People Mart family members.
In the next two months,
I am going to distribute all the shares
of People Mart company
equally to all the employees
and make them my family members.
It seems we might not just get a kingdomâ€¦
but the whole empire.
Atharva,
I was just thinking about an appropriate
gift for your upcoming birthday.
Now I know what to give you.
Yesterday, who came to my house
and threatened my father in my absence
and asked him to hand over the property?
-It was me.
-It was me.
-It was me.
-It was me.
Don't get confused
and commit to your answers.
Once I start thrashing, in the same tune
you'll start saying, "It wasn't me."
That is why think before you speak.
After I start thrashing, I won't listen.
Do you even know whose territory
you have set foot in? You bloodyâ€¦
We were just talking, right?
Why did you hit him?
-I could see a villain in him.
-So what?
If I see a villain in you,
you will see a hero in me.
If I see a villain in you,
you will see a hero in me.
So, when I am talking, ensure that
a villain in you doesn't come out.
First, you have
to go out from here, right?
See, if the villain comes out like thisâ€¦
the hero will come out like this.
See, even the villain in you
is coming out.
-What is your problem?
-What is your problem?
Brother, please don't mind. But if the
villain in us comes out,
then the hero in him will come out
as well, as he said.
So? Do you want us to remain silent?
Yes! If you remain silent
and control your anger,
then he will answer nicely
like Chaganti Koteswara Rao.
Brother, what is your problem?
-Mother asked me to get some fruit.
-Then go to the fruit shop.
Yesterday, someone came home
grinding his teeth. She wants his teeth.
If you grind your teeth like that,
then he'll take them out.
Smile. A little more.
Turn towards him.
Brother, what is your real problem?
I am not yet married. At home,
they are looking for a match for me.
Until then, do want me to send someone?
Do you have that business too?
What does he think about me?
What do you think?
Oh, God! Oh, no!
Are you happy now?
-Have you cooled down?
-Why is he after me?
In my life, I have never come across
a person with this much clarity.
You don't know how to ask him a question.
Why are coming at him like that?
Smile. A little more.
Turn towards him.
-Brotherâ€¦
-Bro!
You said we threatened someone yesterday.
But we threaten ten guys every day.
How do we know
who was your father among them?
One second!
Okay.
-Father!
-Yes.
Did you finish one round?
Done. The entertainment round
is going on right now.
-Isn't it, right?
-Yes, yes.
-Show me.
-See.
Oh, you are his son?
We will snatch that house
by killing everyone in your family.
There he comes.
The villain in all of you has come out.
Except you,
the villain in all of you has come out.
The hero in me is coming out.
He is coming out. Hold this.
Hey, you said it's been a while since
you've seen your son fight, right?
-Yes!
-Come, come.
-See.
-Show me.
Dear, you said it's been a while since
you've seen your brother fight, right?
Come, come.
Hey, hit that bald guy now!
He was talking too much yesterday.
-Beat him.
-Everyone will get some extra.
Look at this.
You were talking too much, right?
-That's it!
-Madam, you keep calm.
You're provoking your son to hit us more.
If something happens to us,
then we don't even have health insurance.
Then why did you cross his path?
He is already a crazy person!
He only provokes and he only beats.
What do we do? Our time is bad.
Oh! This reminds me, did you go
to the office? It's time already.
Oh! I forgot about it.
Let me give them a small warning
and then I will go. Bye.
-Bye!
-Bye!
-My father told me only one thing.
-What did he say?
If there's a fight, then just fight.
Don't think.
I'm a common man, aren't I?
This is enough, right?
-Enough.
-Say that with a smile.
-Enough.
-More.
Enough!
Good boy.
Earlier, I told my mother
that I will just give you a warning.
But I don't know how
to threaten using dialogues.
Just imagine!
Since this was your first mistake,
I came here with a silencer.
If this happens again,
then I'll bring a knife.
Do you know what it would be like
if I cut your body parts with a knife?
Thank God!
I didn't get the knife
and that's why you still have your hands.
They look good on you.
Be careful.
-Shall I go then?
-Okay, Brother!
-What?
-Brother, nothing.
-Ask him to go quickly.
-Brother, please go.
Where is Anand?
He's getting ready.
Sir, tablets.
Did something go wrong in Vizag?
Sir, it'sâ€¦
What happened in Vizag?
VIZAG
Keep a close watch on those
who survey in Hyderabad.
Sir, we have marked the lines already.
The only thing left is to connect them.
If you can verify onceâ€¦
Who are you?
Just because I've stepped foot on your
200 acres of land, you ask me, who am I
and who permitted me to enter.
As an ex-MLA of this Vizag constituency
which is spread across 682 sq. km,
in which you not only entered but also
gave thousands of jobs and built projects
worth hundreds of crores,
shouldn't I ask you, who are you
and who permitted you to enter?
Please, sir! Don't create a mess.
Let us sit and talk.
I have come here to talk.
That is why my
men are behind and you all are alive.
No, sir. Listen to what I'm saying once.
You listen to what I'm saying!
As long as this company is here,
I need ten percent of the business.
Sir, this is the hard work
of some thousands of people.
We can't sell this for free
and insult their hard work.
I am sorry, sir.
Fifty people?
He has never laid his finger on anyone.
How did he come out of this?
My father told me one thing,
when two people come for a fight,
the one who comes forward
and strikes is a common man.
The one who sits across the table
and solves the problemâ€¦
is a businessman.
For a mere ten percent
of the profit of my company,
this man is stupid enough to hire you guys
to kill the company owner.
Would a sane person be on the side
of the one who earns 100 rupees,
Or will he be on the side of the
person who came begging for ten rupees?
And of course,
at present, he will take care of you.
But for how long will he pay you?
Tomorrow when you'll turn 40-50 years old
and your strength will decline,
will he still take care of you?
You want to stop all this
and do something.
But seeing your background,
no one will give you a job.
I will. I'll give jobs to all of you in
my company so that you live with dignity.
Eight hours of work every day.
I won't call you like him.
I do not call for such things.
Work till you're 60
and take a pension after that.
You won't have
to depend on anyone until you die.
My company needs delivery boys.
Who else is more qualified than you,
who knows every corner of this area?
Think about it.
If you want to work with me, then kill
the evil inside you and come with me.
If you want to work with him,
then kill me and go inside.
Why are you listening
to his stories? Kill him!
Here comes mass, who stops you
Chases you, confronts you, and wins over
He is the class who blends his heart
And brain into a sharp weapon
He is the one with the stiff upper lip
He is the corporate power
Whatever he touches is like lightning
He illuminates like a thousand-watt bulb!
He is no less than a landmine!
Bro, he is a veritable gold mine!
It's a double dhamaka!
By nature, he is a rebel
Full of aggression
A symbol of mass in every human being
A prince by birth
But always simple
He embodies the elements of class
In all of us
He doesn't mince words
Nor waste words
The philosophy of his life is
Chill bro, chill and chill
Take this route or another
Any route is fine
When he gets into the race
He becomes the boss of bosses
Here comes mass, who stops you
Chases you, confronts you and wins over
-Has MD come?
-Sir, he came in the morning.
You said that you will apply for a loan
the other day, did you apply?
If it gets approved sooner,
then I will spend it. So I didn't.
I have applied now.
In 15 days, it will be sanctioned.
Then marriage after 30 days.
Everything will be set.
Sir, you're great!
Swami, MD sir is calling you.
Looks like my loan has been sanctioned!
I will see you!
Thanks for sanctioning my loan.
-Did you get into a fight?
-Yes, sir.
-I want to see the hero in you.
-Sir, I didn't get your point.
Termination letter.
Why sir?
It seems you are not afraid
of the one you hit earlier, right?
Sir, not at all.
-I do fear.
-Sir?
If he comes again,
you will beat him, right?
Definitely, sir!
I can't beat him. That's why.
Three people trust me at home.
Three hundred people
trust me in my office.
This idiot has made up his mind!
What do you want to say?
If you are fired, then I will be a hero.
If you quit, then you'll be a hero.
I want to see the hero in you.
Running a diaper company is not enough.
You should have the courage
to not want to wear it so often.
Coward fellow. Coward.
Fold it and keep it inside.
It's okay. He has only scolded me.
During the prospective match,
Dad said he wanted a grand wedding.
He said this all of a sudden,
so I'm not sure if you're prepared.
If you don't mind, I'd like to help you
with it, without letting my parents know.
Oh, no! It's okay.
My son has made all the arrangements.
It's our responsibility
to organize a grand wedding.
Yes.
-Oh, it's done? So I'll take your leave.
-Alright.
-Bye.
-Good.
Alright
See you.
All good?
I don't know.
I told him that
we will have a grand wedding.
My boss gave me a send-off
from the office in a grand manner
-Why?
-I lost my job.
-What do we do now?
-What do we do? We do nothing.
My manager said that
currently there's no job opening.
Even if there are any,
they'd need a salary slip of six months--
Stop the nonsense
and give any solution if you have.
If you get a job
within a month and if the salary
is credited to your account,
only then can a loan be sanctioned.
Brother, without any job,
a loan of ten lakhs is difficult.
Finding a job within 30 days is tough.
Sir, it will be nice if Anand
succeeds you as the CEO.
Sanjay, Anand never wanted
to become the CEO.
Don't try new things now.
To make my son the CEO,
he sent him to America for his MBA.
Brother, isn't that so?
That means Anand--
Uncle, Vikram will become
the CEO of our company.
When is he returning from America?
Let my brother say yes,
he will be here tomorrow morning.
How is that girl?
She is very good.
She is beautiful.
Shall I talk to her father?
What do you say?
-Father.
-Son!
-I have only two months.
-He didn't take his tablets.
Shall I leave
without seeing your marriage?
It's not that father.
Your birthday is coming up in 30 days.
By that time, we need
to give 1000 jobs at our Vizag factory.
Seeing the happiness of those
1000 families is your birthday gift.
We will talk after that.
Your wish.
Father, take your tablets.
Thousand jobs in 30 days?
Impossible!
Hello. First time?
-Yes, sir.
-So many times.
Why don't they talk
after they call you? Hello?
Brother, I have come to the coffee shop
to meet your brother-in-law.
If you keep meeting him
before marriage thenâ€¦
-Sorry, brother! Sorry, sorry.
-Hello, brother?
If you keep meeting him before marriage,
then at the time of marriage,
we'll have to make settlements.
Why did you go alone?
Brother, I came along with my friend.
I called you thinking
that you would also join us.
I have come for an interview.
I'll come after it's done.
-Oh, okay.
-Cut the call. Cut it.
Why were you terminated
from your previous job?
Excuse me, sir!
-Hello! Brother!
-I'm still in an interview.
Didn't I tell you
I will come after it's over?
-Mister!
-Sister!
Why were you terminated
from your previous job?
Sorry, sir. I will switch it off.
This is why you were terminated
from your previous job!
Sir, you should quit HR and become
a detective. You'll have a bright future.
Stop staring!
Give me my rÃ©sumÃ©!
You and your stupid job!
Get lost!
Where is he?
Subbuâ€¦ where is Subha?
-I am Subbu's friend.
-Oh!
I had stopped the car
to give food packets to the elderly
and they started teasing me.
I wanted to call my dad,
but Subbu's phone and mine got exchanged.
Okay. I will leave.
You guys carry on.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Oh!
I checked the dial list
and saw a name saved as brother.
I thought there wouldn't be any problem
and you would come to save me.
So, I was the one who messaged you.
So, you messaged me,
"Brother, I'm in trouble."
Bro!
I don't have any relationship
with this girl. You can continue.
What are you saying?
I'm not related to her. It's your wish.
Why are you leaving?
What about you? What's your
height? What about your physique?
What's your color?
Can you call me your brother?
In that sense, can you call anyone
in this world your brother?
For this reason, you will leave me and go?
From the same number if you message,
"Cutie, I'm in trouble.
Come and save me."
And send the same location,
then I will think!
Hello!
What?
Are you trying to be a hero?
Do you have it in you?
To show you, I have it. But, do you?
Do you know
that you are talking to a hero?
Hey, who gave my dialogue to him?
-Are you messaging me or not?
-No.
Hey, I won't come your way this time.
Do as you, please.
Hello! Hello!
-Hey, he won't come our way.
-Hello!
Shall we proceed?
Cutie, I'm in trouble.
Please come and save me.
I won't come. I am hurt.
Please, my cutie!
My sweetie! Save me, baby!
PLEASE, MY CUTIE!
MY SWEETIE! SAVE ME, BABY!
Hey, who are you?
What do you do? Where did you come from?
Hey, I have come from an interview.
What's your interview about?
Hey, do you know who I am?
Do you know how many are there behind me?
Not even one. Everyone left.
Leave it!
Do you know who will come, if you hit me?
An ambulance, with a driver.
Hey, is it a joke for you?
It will not stop with one.
If you touch me,
then Begumpet Basha will be here.
If Basha comes here,
then it will be somethingâ€¦
-What if I beat up Basha?
-What? You will beat up Basha?
You will beat up Bashaâ€¦
Basha is a big goon.
Answer my question. If I beat up Basha
then who will show up?
If you beat up Basha
then Shaikpet Sharif will be here.
Do you know Sharif is a bodybuilder?
Oh! If I beat up Shaikpet Sharif
then who will show up?
What? You will beat up Shaikpet Sharif?
You will beat up Shaikpetâ€¦ Sharif?
-What? Shaikpet Sharif?
-Hey, hey, hey!
Don't get so excited. Tell me who will
show up if I beat up Shaikpet Sharif?
If you beat up Sharif,
then Malakpet Mallesh will be here.
He's the biggest goon in this city!
Then come, let's go.
Did you see, darling?
He's scared of my brother's name.
What I meant was, why beat up all of them?
Let's directly go to Mallesh
and beat him up.
Hey!
Greetings brother.
Darling, sit down.
Brother, what do you want? Tell me.
I need to beat up someone.
You've come while I'm eating
and asked to beat up someone.
I can beat anyone.
Who do you want to thrash?
Brother, I need to beat you up.
Brother has cracked a joke.
No, not at all. I have to beat you up.
Why me?
He misbehaved with my lady.
If he's misbehaving with your lady,
then go and beat him up.
What do I've to do with it?
Thrash him if you want!
He said, If I beat him up then
Begumpet Basha will come to his rescue.
If you have the guts, then go
and beat up Begumpet Basha.
If I beat that Basha then
Shaikpet Sharif will come to his rescue.
If you're a real man
then go and beat that Shaikpet Sharif.
I've been told, If I beat him then
Malakpet Mallesh will show up.
If you are a hero,
then go and beat that Malakpet Mallesh!
Brother, that's why I'm here.
Hey, everyone says that I'm crazy.
But you look like a young prince
from a crazy kingdom.
Brother, I have to beat you up.
I'm dealing with you like a kid
and you're fooling around.
Bodybuilders!
They are my followers.
If you have the guts, beat them up.
Not me! Them!
-Brother, I won't beat them up.
-Are you scared?
I'm here only to beat you up!
I'll only fight you!
Heyâ€¦ finish him
by the time I finish eating my food.
-Oh!
-Hey!
Hey!
Don't mistake a lion's silence
for its weakness. Once it turns violentâ€¦
And after thatâ€¦
What are you thinking?
Finish your dialogue!
With a face like that, an incomplete
warning itself is more than enough.
Why should I waste the whole thing on you?
-Mallu, shall I go?
-Go!
-Hey, why are you shouting?
-Please, don't come again.
Leave.
Darling, where is he? Has he left?
-Yes.
-Let's go!
Hello!
Hello!
I talking to you.
Why did you beat them up,
when it was someone else who teased me?
If the girl, we are interested in
is facing a problem,
then we must ensure
that the problem doesn't reoccur.
-Interest?
-What's your name?
Pranavi!
Pranavi baby, I love you so much.
Do you say love you
to everyone after asking their name?
In an arranged marriage,
you can marry after asking for their name.
I shouldn't say I love you?
You might wonder
why you should consider me.
So let me tell you about myself
My name is Swami.
I had a job earlier but lost it recently.
Well, I don't claim to be a very pious
man. But it's okay I'm a good man.
Like other guys, I won't say that
I haven't loved anyone before.
I won't even say that when I first
saw you, I heard the love bells ring.
Three years ago,
I was deeply in love with a girl.
But that girl married a richer man
than me and left. Bad luck.
I don't have any bad habits.
At night, I have two pegs
and two cigarettes when I'm feeling low.
-Do you have any habits?
-Damn!
Thank God!
How dare you?
1800 sq. ft. house,
21 inches TV, a single-door fridge,
and a two-wheeler.
All this is in your in-law's house.
Oh! So we're discussing
my in-law's house already?
Not just about your in-law's house!
I have even thought about the stage
where we will have two kids
and there will be two folds
around your waist.
I will wake you up in the morning
and we'll go for a jog and a walk.
So think carefully and give your decision
about our marriage to my sister.
Okay, darling? Quickly go to your house.
And quickly come back to my mine.
-Huh?
-Yes!
Don't think too much.
Enough now. Go home.
Finally, we met after so many days.
The other day, you spoke so well.
You have progressed step by step
but I'm not like you.
I want to grow by taking shortcuts.
It's not possible
to build a step every time, right?
That's whyâ€¦
in the next five years, whichever company
is on the top I want to occupy that.
I never thought of occupying your company.
But when you said
that you will die in two monthsâ€¦
If I like anything then I give four
options to the people on the other side.
One.
If given whatever
is asked for then it's a donation.
Two.
If taken whatever
is asked then it's business.
Three.
If you hit and snatch
it then it's tyranny.
Four.
Occupying by killing, which
is the rule of the jungle.
That is politics.
Intelligent people will select
and settle with the first two options.
So, let's come back to the first option.
I wantâ€¦ your company.
To buy this company,
I'm giving you an offer.
Hey, I don't think this is a bad number.
I'm not for sale!
For a lion, there's only one rule.
If a lion is hungry,
it hunts.
If a lion is hungryâ€¦
it hunts.
I'm hungry.
Be ready to faceâ€¦
the other two options.
The other day, you said something.
"I'm living successfully,
I want to die successfully."
Right?
You might be living successfullyâ€¦
but you are not going to die successfully.
You will have to deal with me
in order to get there.
We will meet again.
-Sir, that--
-Anand shouldn't know about this.
I don't want him to be dragged into this.
Dear, what are you getting ready for?
Dad is taking me out somewhere.
He asked me to get ready.
Oh!
I need to tell you something.
-What is it?
-Come, I'll tell you.
What is it?
Yesterday, a guy proposed to me.
Is my son-in-law
handsome or average-looking?
He's very handsome.
Is my son-in-law a softie or a rebel?
He's a rebel.
Is my son-in-law innocent or mature?
He's mature.
Is my son-in-law well settled
or struggling?
I don't know. Wait, why do you
address him as your son-in-law?
It is evident that you also like him,
or else you would have objected
at the very first instance
I addressed him as that.
But do note that your
father will accept him
as son-in-law only if he's settled.
Or else he won't budge at all.
Mom, I know that Dad
isn't a villain.
I have been married
to him for the past 25 years.
Don't you think I know
whether he's a hero or a villain?
-Dear, Pranavi!
-Go, he's calling you.
Shall we go, dear?
You look like Goddess Mahalakshmi!
No wonder she takes after me!
To avoid ambiguity, please specify if she
resembles Goddess Mahalakshmi or you.
You're a driver. Better behave like one.
You too, better behave like an owner.
Sir, I like you
as you don't treat me like a servant.
-Shall we go
-Dad, where are we headed to?
Surprise!
Come on, it's a surprise. Let's go.
One fine day, she will shock
you by giving you a "surprise" as well!
-Where have you brought me, Dad?
-To see a prospective bridegroom.
-Huh?
-Yes!
I have finalized an extraordinary guy.
We're here as he wanted to talk to you.
How can you finalize him
without asking me?
That's why it's a surprise!
Would you accept if your
daughter brings some guy to surprise you?
I'm sparing you only because luck
has favored me since you joined.
I'm scared that if I quit,
you might abandon everything
and start living the life of an ascetic.
I'll kill you.
You might be able
to scare him with your threats.
Shut up!
-Get lost. Wait in the car.
-Ensure that you don't get bankrupt.
Hey!
I chose a guy based on your preferences.
Share your opinion after talking to him.
Come, come, comeâ€¦
There he is.
I know your heart
Yes, you know
I know you like him
Yes, you know
Come. Come on!
Dear, come.
Sir, greetings!
Greetings! How are you?
I am fine, sir.
Hi!
I and his father have been friends for a
long time. And finally, you both have met.
-You had planned this from the beginning?
-Of course, we did.
You guys talk to each other
-while I wait for you.
-Okay.
-Oh!
-Carry on.
Do you work in this office?
-Yeah!
-Okay.
It's exciting when friends become family.
Friends, familyâ€¦
Aah! Yes! Correct!
Did you know me, when we met earlier?
I'm meeting
after gathering all the details.
What else do you know?
Pranavi, B.Tech student.
Ladakh is your favorite place.
You love heights and are scared of water.
You love chili fritters from Poorna
Tiffin Center,
Bahar's mutton biryani,
and paya from Goa Niyaz.
Bhanu is your best friend.
You won't talk
for at least four days if you're angry.
You like clothes
from Gucci and watches from Swarovski.
Your favorite color is blue,
and 3 Idiots is your favorite movie.
Your favorite song is
"Aamani Paadave Hayiga." A beautiful song.
I am impressed.
Apart from all thatâ€¦
Feeding the hungry gives you happiness
and satisfaction.
Is it enough or shall I continue?
But how do you know all this?
I'm a businessman and I get into
something only after thorough research.
Do you want to ask me about anything?
I have collected all this information
without your permission.
However, I can't
take your number without your consent.
96
Just a second!
-Yeah!
-9603104762
Perfect! I'll text you.
Dad!
Did you like the girl, Anand?
Almost.
Should I speak to her father?
No, Dad. Let's not rush things.
She hasn't shared her opinion yet.
Don't cause me another tension.
Dad, I will marry her.
Okay?
-Momâ€¦
-What is it dear?
I told you earlier about Swami, right?
-Yes.
-Dad has fixed my marriage with Swami.
He has done thorough research about me.
I liked him a lot.
-Is it?
-Hello, Priestâ€¦
My daughter's marriage is fixed
with a guy.
Find an auspicious time
for the engagement.
We can start preppingâ€¦
Didn't you call him a villain?
What do you want to say now?
Something's fishy.
I too felt it was fishy.
-Isn't it?
-Nothing.
Mom, you have misunderstood Dad.
When you type love in the chat,
it autocorrects to Dad.
Do you know?
This is the meaning of aâ€¦ father.
-Oh!
-Oh!
One minute.
-Hello.
-I came to know that my Brother met you
and he has thrashed somebody for you.
And he has also proposed to you.
-Yes.
-Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I should have informed you. Butâ€¦
Forget about me.
Just tell him whether you accept
or reject his proposal. He's anxious.
I told him that I like him
in the office earlier.
How could you meet him
in the office? He was fired a week ago.
Isn't my father and your father friends?
It looks like you're confused.
He's anxious to know your answer.
I have called you
to ask whether I can share your number.
Can I give your number to him?
Alright, give him.
Okay.
Dad!
-I'm wondering what to do with this money.
-Dad, what's his name?
Have you given your
consent without knowing his name?
He's Anand Chakravarthy.
My name's Swami.
What does he do?
He's the future CEO
of Peoples Mart company.
I have been fired from my job recently.
Hello Sir!
I would like to open
another account in SBI.
I'm glad that you're
marrying the guy, you like.
I need to tell you something.
I and Dad have met two different people.
-Didn't you say they're the same?
-They look the same.
Huh?
One of them is my friend's brother, Swami.
Look.
WHAT DECISION HAVE YOU TAKEN?
The other one
is Dad's friend's son Anand Chakravarthy.
Oh, no! What have you done?
What should I do now?
-Earlier you said that you liked Swami.
-Yes.
-Now, you're saying that you like Anand.
-Yes.
-Does that mean you like them both?
-Yes.
-Do they also like you?
-Yes.
What am I supposed to do now?
Travel with them
and choose the one you like the most.
-Let's think then. Okay?
-Okay.
I thought I will remain single
And not fall in love
Whatever happened to that?
Beware of the boys, Dad used to warn
Whatever happened to that?
No sooner did I see him than
I started liking him
And didn't realize he was inside me
Even beyond this pillow
I couldn't think beyond him
Girl, he disturbed the whole system
What's happening?
What's happening in my heart?
What's happening?
What's happening in my heart?
What's happening?
What's happening in my heart?
What's happening?
What's happening in my heart?
I used to sleep at 10 pm
Now I lie awake till 2 am because of him
I dared not step beyond my room
now I return home around 7 pm
Even when I am skipping buddy's parties
I charge my phone thrice a day
Because I spend more time with him
Than with myself all these years
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening in my heart?
What's happening?
What's happening in my heart?
What's happening?
What's happening in my heart?
What's happening?
What's happening in my heart?
Once I occupy something,
I don't even share it with the owner.
How did you think
that I would share it with an outsider?
I'm an Ex-MLA of Vizag.
Nobody has survived once they opposed me.
The whole of Vizag is under my control.
The gun in my hand
doesn't know that the opponent is an MLA.
It doesn't even know
there's an ex-MLA on the other side.
What kind of bullet are you?
Atharva, didn't he say
that nobody survived if they opposed him?
I wonder when will these MLAs stop lying.
-Hello, Chakravarthy.
-Yes?
I have promised my son that I will gift
him your company on his birthday.
You should make it to my son's birthday.
I mean, by stepping out of your company.
Oh, by the way,
I heard you are opening
a new branch in Vizag.
I thought I will take a small break
until that branch is operational,
so I can occupy the whole thing.
Do remember that you will only be the
company's CEOâ€¦
until the Vizag branch opens.
I'm hungry.
What's the status of the Vizag branch?
Sir, there's a slight delay
of one to two days.
Sanjay, it will be best to increase
the manpower and order
extra equipment if you want. But I want
the inaugural on time. Is that clear?
Okay, sir.
Have you decided between the two?
I'm unable to decide, Mom.
The one rejected by you will suffer ten
times more than the one accepted by you.
It's okay if you make
him wait until you choose him.
But if you want
to reject someone, don't make him wait.
Better go tomorrow
and tell the one who you want to reject.
Any woman who marries a man will
only weigh two aspects.
One is how they value you as a person.
Two is how much their family loves you.
Good morning everybody!
I have realized that hunger
is a problem that needs to be addressedâ€¦
through a friend
who recently entered my life.
One out of every seven
in this world is sleeping with hunger.
I'm unsure if I should feel happy
that we don't belong to that category
or worried that
the remaining six aren't helping them.
Many people want to donate food to the
needy. But they don't know where to give.
And someone hungry
doesn't know where to find donors.
This food bank will bring the needy and
those willing to donate
on a common platform.
A small request for all of you.
I urge you all to donate the
leftover food from your parties,
functions, and hotels to these food banks.
From now on,
let's share our love, not the leftovers.
This applause and
respect belong to my friend Pranaviâ€¦
who shared this idea with me.
Any woman who marries a man will
only weigh two aspects.
One is how they value you as a person.
She's sure to surprise her father.
Pranavi?
Come inside.
Who is she?
Our daughter's friend
and our son'sâ€¦
Have you said "yes" to my son?
Not yet.
Have you come here to say yes?
-Actuallyâ€¦
-Don't feel shy.
Hey, don't tell him now.
Let him run around you for some time,
then you can tell him.
-I will be back.
-Huh?
Oh, Mother, it's already delayed.
I've already
forgotten the post-marriage rituals.
We need to revise the old syllabus
if she yes.
Stop it!
Once you say yes to marrying my son.
We'll need more time
to get to know each other.
So, I would suggest you
stop delaying any further.
Get to know each other?
Shouldn't we also love you
and accept you?
Huh?
Why will you love me?
Love is to avoid any misunderstandings.
And live harmoniously post-marriage.
More than my son,
we need to love each other.
What about him?
He wakes up in the morning
and leaves for the office in an hour.
Returns from office
and retires to bed within two hours.
At most he might spend
three-four hours with you, post-marriage.
Don't you think
that we must have more understanding
and love for each other,
as we'll spend more time together?
You must not feel
that you're unable to gel well with
your in-laws even if you
and your husband are bonding well.
We aren't sure when
will you share your consent with our son.
But we'll share it now!
Love you so much, sweetie.
I love you, sister-in-law.
I love you, dear.
I love you more, Pranavi baby!
That's it.
What's wrong with you?
This house has more drama
than the Bigg Boss house.
I will see your end.
Tell me.
Everyone is praising
the grandeur of your daughter's wedding.
All praises for the wedding feast.
Have you lost your mind? When did
my daughter's marriage take place?
Your daughter has hooked up with someone.
She's outperforming the stars in TV soaps.
If you don't pay attention now,
then someone will call you
to praise you for the wedding feast.
Who's that?
Do you want to verify his background,
instead of killing him?
I will ensure that his
entire family is wiped out.
Waiting!
I'm gifting you the
costliest saree my husband has gifted me.
Do you know why?
I wish it will come back
to my wardrobe once you marry my son.
Oh, no!
Please take it and stay blessed.
Two is how much the family loves you.
Oh! Kisses!
-I'm unable to bear it!
-Yes! Yes!
Please reserve some for us also.
-Sir!
-I don't need your salute.
What is happening? Did you drag him out?
What are you waiting for? Shoot him.
-Blast the building!
-Move!
-Ensure that no one survives.
-Sir, your daughter is inside.
-Hold on, hold on!
-Stop!
Oh my God! My daughter is inside.
Oh my God! My daughter is inside.
-What are you waiting for? Announce it!
-Yes, sir.
Mr. Swami, handover Ramesh Reddy's
daughter. Otherwise, we will open fire.
Pranavi!
Hey, Kill him!
Dad!
Don't shoot.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Sir, you?
Sir, why are you saluting the opponent?
He's not an enemy.
He's a great person
who people like you can't comprehend.
I assumed that my daughter is
in Kukatpally.
Instead, she is in a
sacred place like Kashi.
I haven't realized that she's
at the feet of God Viswanath!
Please forgive me!
Please don't say that.
I will get my daughter married to you
right here, right now if you accept.
Please!
I haven't decided to marry her yet!
She has informed me that she loves me.
I was about to bring her
to you saying that it's not correct.
In the meantime, you have come.
Sir, she wants to marry you.
Please say yes, sir.
Please forgive me, Mr. Ramesh Reddy
I can't marry until my sister is married.
I can't neglect my duties
and responsibilities.
Please take her.
Do you have a sister?
How would you know
if he has a sister or not?
-May I know, who you are?
-His father.
But, you're not his father, right?
How can you decide who is his father?
What's your name?
Did you come here without knowing my name?
-Swami.
-What do you do?
I have been fired
from my job. I'm roaming carelessly.
What do you do?
He has a daughter,
so he roams like a fool.
Come.
Hey, catch!
-Oh! He grabbed it.
-Exactly.
Wrist band!
The dude who has the most fab wristband
And handkerchief, Hey girl?
Hey, those creaking sounds
Of the marching Kinnera singers
Belong to that rustic guy is it?
The dude who has the most fab wristband
And handkerchief, Hey girl?
Hey, those creaking sounds
Of the marching Kinnera singers
Belong to that rustic guy is it?
Gifting me an anklet
Or ensnaring me with those bangles
Hug me like a nose-ring,
Or plant kisses as your imprint
Or come like a festival
And grab the feast of beauty
The most fab wristband and handkerchief
The dude who has the most fab wristband
And handkerchief, Hey dear!
Hey, those creaking sounds
Of the marching Kinnera singers
Belong to that rustic guy is it?
Your piercing looks
chiming with my cheeks
Come let's smell the flowers
And break the bed
The space of your anklets
Is what this landlord thirsts for
Let me sow my seeds
In your territory now!
The whole expanse is yours
From here to there
Look not, hither thither
And take a grand view
Tell me not to stop, my darling!
The manliness in me
Makes me not take a breath!
The most fab wristband and handkerchief
The dude who has the most fab wristband
And handkerchief, Hey dear!
Hey, those creaking sounds
Of the marching Kinnera singers
Belong to that rustic guy is it?
-Let's march into the woods
-Let's march into the woods
-The jaggery from Dead Sea apple
-The jaggery from Dead Sea apple
-Which you gave to the fox instead of me
-Which you gave to the fox instead of me
-That jaggery got stuck in its jaw
-That jaggery got stuck in its jaw
And the fox thawed it out
All the way to the village
And the fox thawed it out
All the way to the village
-That's when we all woke up
-That's when we all woke up
And saw a flowery purse in the garden
And a lovely blouse
Next to the flowery purse
This flower is for you
Handle me delicately
Plant the umbrella
In the middle of your vast chest!
And I will hang by
Your side like a coat-tail
And fill your heart with moonshine!
Will you guard vigil like a parakeet?
Or watch me like a rattle on the well?
Forget all that familiar chatter
I can plant
A pebble in your midriff and hit it hard!
The most fab wristband and handkerchief
The dude who has the most fab wristband
And handkerchief, Hey dear!
Hey, those creaking sounds
Of the marching Kinnera singers
Belong to that rustic guy is it?
The joy a dad gets
when his son gets a job is the same joy
you all are experiencing right now.
But my joy knows no bounds when my
son said he has given jobs to 1000 people.
But my real birthday
gift is not these 1000 jobs,
but the joy to 1000 families,
or rather the ownership
bestowed on 1000 family members.
Welcome to the family of People Mart.
And on this happy note,
I would like to announce
that People Mart will
have its new CEO from the 1st of April.
Anand,
JP met me a few days back.
Dad, are you afraid of him?
You don't know him well enough.
Dad, I will speak to JP.
He won't listen to anyone once
he sets his sights on something.
It's okay,
Dad, we both know of someone
who can deal with this issue.
Shall we?
Mom!
I decided
that Swami is the right choice for me.
Anand is coming here now.
I'll tell him my decision.
I'd rather kill Swami than
get my daughter married to him.
Hey!
Hey, call me after killing him.
Are you sure about this?
Hey, stop irritating me.
I will not hesitate to spend ten lakhs
more to get you murdered as well.
I will keep quiet if you
increase my salary by ten thousand.
Increase it at least by five thousand
Call me after killing him!
Come, let's go!
Please leave ten thousand here.
Sir!
Please don't disturb me for a while.
No, no. Not for some time.
One hour.
Till one hour no more disturbance.
Good morning, Chakravarthy ji!
Within that one hourâ€¦
I will finish the game.
Is your son going to be the new CEO?
JP!
Please don't trouble him. Let's talk.
Come on, talk.
Lookâ€¦
I will not transfer this
company to others as long as I'm alive.
A goat that is under the knifeâ€¦
must not have any desires, Chakravarthy.
I have decided that I want this company.
So, you can die once the company is mine.
The plan is simple Chakravarthy.
I will take one life today.
Hello, Pranavi.
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
I will kill your son who's
on the way home.
Anand!
I have come to know that
your son doesn't hit anyone.
Oh no!
Atharva, are you ready?
Ready, Daddy.
He's ready. Let the fun begin.
Move!
We have unnecessarily brought so many
people to kill him.
Looks like during Annaprashana,
he picked the bangles.
Hey, have you killed him?
We will kill him in a minute.
Hey!
Call me once you have killed him.
Damn!
Let's go!
He's just ten seconds awayâ€¦ from death.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Swami! Swami can help.
Four.
Three.
Calling your son?
Would you like to talk
to your son one last time?
As I have only one month to live,
I don't want to die
like a failed businessman.
Son, be true to yourself.
To deal with this, one should not talk
like a businessman,
but like a revolting commoner.
Uncleâ€¦ Swami?
-Anand?
-Both are the same.
He is Swami as well as Anand!
A loving son,
who belongs to both families.
He is a king as well as a commoner.
One man. Two characters.
Two families.
Swami Vivekananda Chakravarthy.
My son.
Pranavi!
I'm already here on duty!
What is going on there?
Have our men killed him?
Did our men kill him?
He's killing our men, Daddy.
And the show begins.
If I see a villain in youâ€¦
you'll see a hero in me!
Usually, my father asks me
to restrain myself.
Can you imagine how it would
be if he permitted me to thrash you?
It's just like releasing
a bull after showing him a red cloth.
A range rover hitting you
at a speed of 200.
Hey, take her home.
Why did you run when you're capable
of fighting back?
To make you run harder
and get beaten up. It's called sadism!
It's heroic to thrash you after
you chase me rather than me chasing you.
But I'm a sadist when I'm in action!
Have you killed him yet? Have you?
Sir, is he a man or a washing machine?
He's smacking us.
Have you credited my salary?
It's the first of the month.
Have you credited my salary?
From where did I find you?
Sir, even I feel the same way.
Easy, easy!
Today, I am going
to take away one life for sure!
I came here to kill you
and spare your dad.
If we can't kill youâ€¦
we will kill your father.
Now, you decide.
If you will die or let your father die?
Nice boy!
Sir, we've killed him.
Have you killed him? Super!
Mr. Chakravarthy, see you again.
What have you done to my son?
What have you done to my son?
Tell me before you leave, JP.
-Sir
-What did you do?
Tell me!
The channel to become the CEO
got cleared right before you arrived.
I have also designed the office
to your liking.
What happened, Son? Are you jet lagged?
Dad, what is this?
My Brother is missing, and you're talking
about the office and CEO!
Let's go to the police station
and lodge a complaint!
Uncle, I've filed a complaint
at the police station,
and personally requested the DIG
to use extra force.
We'll soon know
about my brother's whereabouts.
Don't worry.
Vikram,
I'm here to sort out all these things.
Why didn't you head straight home
from the airport?
Uncle, Anand is your only sonâ€¦
and my only brother.
More than me,
it's important for Anand to return home.
Oh my God!
Do those scoundrels want to kill my son?
-May they rot in hell!
-Calm down, Devaki.
How did you survive
when you were put in the mortuary?
That mortuary in the hospital
is run by Mr. Chakravarthy's charity.
Someone just recognized me at the last
minute and saved me after they left.
How did you conceal the wounds?
To someone who passes off as two peopleâ€¦
managing these wounds is not a big deal.
My dear Pranavi, come here.
Does that mean Swami
and Anand aren't two people?
But the same?
Then how come you are here and there?
Where are you staying?
So far no one
knows this truth except our two families,
but I'm sharing this with you now
because you ought to know this.
Vasudeva Rao is my dad.
When I was four years
old, I went with my dad to the exhibition.
And then I got lost.
Dad!
Dad!
-Swami! Swami! Swami!
-Dad! Dad! Dad!
-Dad! Dad! Dad!
-Swami! Swami! Swami!
Mr. Chakravarthy saw me as he was passing
by and held my hand like my own dad.
He took me to his house.
And continued looking for my dad.
Inquire about his parents.
On the other side,
my dad was also looking for me.
Four years later, Mr. Chakravarthy traced
my dad's whereabouts.
Those four years of bonding.
And 25 years of his values.
He wasn't sure which one to let go of.
As a man of values,
he didn't leave his personality.
The next day,
he came to see me early in the morning.
Dear?
After four years,
we got so used to sleeping
with our boy around.
So, we wanted to see him again.
Why didn't you wake us up?
Oh, God!
After four years,
he's finally sleeping with his family.
I didn't want to disturb you.
We were so sad he went missing
for four years.
We can understand the pain of separation
you feel after four years of attachment.
He is as much your son as ours.
From now onwards, he will spend a day
in your house and a day in ours.
Keep them inside.
If you're sending all this stuff,
it looks as if our son belongs
to your household.
He doesn't seem like our son.
Please send my son just like
how he is before he leaves.
Since then I've been staying there
like how this dad likes.
And staying here like
how this dad raised me.
But why have two different personalities?
If he stays just the way he is
in the other house, won't he be
just another guest rather than a son?
Nanda Gopal Chakravarthy
should not be a failure in his last days.
So, what is your plan now?
Sir, we've shortlisted
two candidates for your PA.
If you want to take
the final interviewâ€¦
Send him inside.
Chakravarthy's son is dead.
After 20 days, he will also die.
After that, who can stop me
from taking ownership of his company?
Excuse me, Sir!
Yes.
Sir, it's okay, please sit down.
It seems, along with high salaries
you also give high respect here.
You areâ€¦
Am I not the one you called?
Hey, excuse me!
This is my rÃ©sumÃ© and my certificates.
Sir, I'm very happy.
To be shortlisted in such a big company,
for a genius like youâ€¦
It's a great feeling sir.
Sir?
-Take his details from the company mail.
-Yes, sir.
Within five minutes, I want every
piece of information about him.
-Okay sir.
-Got it?
Yes, sir.
Sir, Swami has been working here
for almost 30 years!
His identity credentials are perfect.
Sir, this guy is different from him.
Sir, please ask any questions you want.
Ask me quickly sir.
Sir, I came completely prepared.
Oh, the phone keeps on ringing.
Sir is so busy, no?
JPâ€¦
I don't know if you killed my son
or hid him somewhere.
But People Mart will not crumble
for the greed of one man.
By tomorrow,
People Mart will have a new CEO.
Try to stop it, if you have the guts.
Sir?
All fine sir?
Okay?
Okayâ€¦ okay!
Sir, shall we start.
Sir, if I get this job, my family will
be forever indebted to your family.
Even to him.
-If I give this job to youâ€¦
-Sir.
Will you doâ€¦ anything for me?
-Shall I stab myself?
-Hey!
No! No! No!
Keep it! Keep it!
Sir, please promise that my sister's
marriage will take place smoothly.
I've your word, right?
Oh, God! This is very heavy!
Safe!
Swami, this is your appointment order,
Your salary will be
two lakh rupees a month
Sir!
You're a PA by designation,
but you will work
as the CEO of PEOPLE MART.
Will I get a salary here or there?
But why?
-My hand
-Oh! Sorry, sir.
People Mart's new CEOâ€¦ is your lookalike.
-Oh, is it?
-Recently, he got killed.
Oh!
So you take his place
and complete a task for me.
Sir, isn't it cheating to impersonate him?
It is cheating
when we do it to folks dear to us.
But it is fair
when we do it for our loved ones.
Sir, are you related to Trivikram?
-What?
-Nothing, you carry on.
Tomorrow morning you have
to sign as the CEO of the company.
Since you are still new,
I will pick you up at your home. Okay?
Okay, sir!
How can I say no, when you are
appointing me as the CEO of People Mart?
It's very exciting for me
to become the CEO under your guidance.
From tomorrow,
you'll be here and I'll be there!
Let's play!
Bye, sir.
When I offered Chakravarthy
thousands of crores,
he refused to sell the company.
Now, I am just paying two lakhs
and taking over the company.
Weakest battle.
-What's this?
-Is it for us?
No, for us!
We are celebrated as heroes
for just being software employees.
So imagine the scale of celebrations
for a CEO of such a big company!
Let's spread the news far and wide!
Splash paper headlines!
Mount cutouts and banners!
Let there be
drumbeats and make lots of noise!
Hey, my buddy!
Let's play kabaddi!
Hey, my buddy!
Break his body!
Here comes the entertainer!
Who wins the applause at B and C centers
Here comes the entertainer!
Who wins the applause at B and C centers
Body local, mind global
Class and mass combo model
Speak to me with love
Everybody say it out loud
This is Mass Mass Raja!
Bang it loud for the music!
This is Mass Mass Raja!
Bang it loud for the music!
Where he stands becomes invaluable
Where he sits attains more arrogance
When he twirls his mustache
It is arrogance
All those with egos have to bow to thee
-When he packs a punch
-Full force
-Anyone has to
-Rest in peace
When he tightens his body
You see the gym-worked magic
Anyone head-strong
Has to salute your photo
This is Mass Mass Raja!
Bang it loud for the music!
This is Mass Mass Raja!
Bang it loud for the music!
-Hey, Ceciroleo.
-Yeah!
Why did you stop? Beat it once more
Yes, it's enough. You guys can go now.
Brother, here is your coat.
Sir! Sir! Sir!
I'm petrified to speak before
-such a large audience.
-Swami
How?
You can do it.
Today is your first day.
All your employees are waiting
to hear your speech.
Just address them
and come straight inside.
Once you come in,
just sign the company shares
and properties in our favor, that's it.
A High Court lawyer will be your witness.
After that, it will be game over.
Sir! Sir! Sir!
I always had stage fear since childhood.
Sir, giving a speech is tough!
-I'll sign if you want--
-You can sign later.
It's a short speech.
Only two lines.
Sir, what two lines?
-It has five lines.
-Hey, just read!
A hearty welcome
to all the family members of People Mart.
Together, we're going
to take this company to greater heights.
It's a promise. That's all from me.
-Yours, Vivek--
-That's it!
-Go.
-Sir, I'm nervous.
-Let me just mug it up.
-Go.
Sir, two minutes.
Sir, just a minute.
One minute.
I'm ready sir.
A hearty welcome
to all the family members of People Mart.
Together, we're going
to take this company to greater heights.
It's a promise. That's all from me.
-Your Vivek Anand Chakravarthy.
-Super!
-Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-Very good.
-Thank you, sir.
-Deliver it fast and wrap it quickly.
Sirâ€¦
Sir, please bless me.
How can you be so naive, dear?
Sir, I have the same feeling toward you.
Go fast.
Move, move, move.
Don't get him worked up.
Inviting the new CEO
of People Mart on the stage.
Anand Chakravarthy?
A hearty welcome
to all the family members of People Mart.
I promise all of you
that I'm going to carry you all along
as the company grows further.
This is your Vivek Anand Chakravarthy.
Vivek
Anand
Chakravarthy.
I have a deep desire to see People
Mart company without a single employee.
Hey, what is he talking about?
My father founded
this company with ten people.
No salary was paid
for the first six months.
No one asked.
The company bled losses
for the next two years.
Again, no salary was paid for nine months.
Yet, nobody asked.
Why?
Because you all felt like â€œowners."
But is it enough if you just feel it?
Even we should believe it!
We have since grown from
ten employees to over 10,000 employees.
But you were employees then
and are employees even now.
What is he talking about?
That's why I am changing the rules
of People Mart as its new CEO.
I'm donating
the CEO's 50 percent share to charity
and distributing the remaining 50 percent,
equally to everyone
from the CEO to the watchman.
Good!
From tomorrow, there
will be no employees in this company.
It will only have owners.
People Mart Group of Industries
will be the only
company where everyone is an owner.
Soon, I will complete all the formalities
and hand them over to you.
Dadâ€¦
as you desired,
all of them are now part of our family.
Because they intended to kill you,
you seemed to have
had a lot of fun with that JP and his son.
Yes, not just fun. It was having
a merry time with each of them.
What you don't know is that
someone else is trying to kill me.
-Who?
-Your dad!
Tomorrow the performance is at your home.
In your houseâ€¦
this will be your emotion.
Your Swami has gone to the afterlife.
What can we do?
That's why they say,
good things happen to good people
Sir, you said something
that doesn't apply to us, what is it?
You're crying over someone
who you met just a month back?
What if she comes to know it is you
who killed him?
Heyâ€¦ please shut up!
Okay.
As any father, I just wish
to find my daughter a good match.
It would have been better
if my dad also had thought the same.
Even if it costs another ten lakhs,
let us bump her off too. Good riddance.
Sir, she is your wife.
So what? Only once.
Sir, keep quiet!
What are you talking about?
Given an opportunity,
every married man wants to do the same.
If there's a rule in India that no case
will be registered
for the murder of a wife,
we will see more murders
than marriages in India.
Enough of your murders!
First, think of how
to get your daughter married to Anand.
I'm also thinking the same.
Uncle!
Hi!
Anand!
Pranavi!
-Anand!
-Yes, Uncle.
How come you are here?
It heard someone killed Pranavi's lover.
How do you know?
Well, don't we inquire more
before marriage, Uncle?
Who can it be?
Someone, who's a cross
between desire and selfishness.
Sir, did you confess?
Who is he?
You waitâ€¦
Let us leave him to his fate.
Hello? Please fetch me a job.
My boss is going to die.
Uncle, I think it's about you.
This is so unfairâ€¦
Uncle, let bygones be bygones.
Uncle, I have no objection
to marrying Pranavi.
I came here to tell you that.
Wow! You coming all the way
to tell this itself means the world to me.
-Uncle, are you happy?
-Very happy.
-Now, let me reveal a truth about life.
-Yes, please tell.
When you want to murder someone
who has a lookalike,
don't show his photo. Show the man!
-Otherwise, this is what happens.
-What happens?
So, you had Anand killed
while hunting for Swami.
-That's what happens.
-The fellow who's gone isâ€¦
Your daughter's fiancÃ©!
-And you?
-The one who will boss over you.
-Swami?
-Yes, baby! Come closer.
You killed Anand and kept his body
in the hospital mortuary, right?
What happens if we
disclose this to his father?
Son, please don't take
such drastic decisions.
Then tell meâ€¦
When are you getting
your daughter married to me?
Why will I get my daughter married to you?
Not even to the new CEO of People Mart?
Son, when will you marry my daughter?
-Didn't you say, no?
-Didn't you say, CEO?
Hey, you untouchable!
You sinner! Eyesore!
Watching you gives one high-level BP!
You widowhood-giver, Giraffe
Cutting you to size
Makes the whole world very happy!
You said no the other day
Said you don't have a dime
Nor anything useful to give
Banished me saying, no money!
Oh, great one!
My brain is dead! Chip loosened!
My IQ went down the drain!
I got my senses back!
The bulb is lit, the route map found!
Please forgive me!
Okay, I give you two minutes!
Tell me how big a dimwit you are
Satisfy my ego!
Then I will think about marriage!
That sounds good!
I am the pee of a pea-sized rat
The droppings of a vulture
The membrane of a cockroach
I am the chin of a pig, the tail of a bat
The lonesome crow's forlorn feather
The only nincompoop you'll find
In all the seven worlds!
I am a good-for-nothing fellow
Dirty dunce
The first and the best
Among the list of dummies!
I am the droplet of your sneeze
The bumper of your car
Your latest tissue paper
The latest loafer
Your waist thread, and your blade!
Show some mercy on me!
And allow me
To wash your feet
Okay, get up!
After seeing the splendid beauty
Of your daughter
After atoning the sins of your misdeeds!
After seeing the splendid beauty
Of your daughter
After atoning the sins of your misdeeds!
I forgive you!
Now, get lost!
If you plan another murder againâ€¦
I will only plan your wedding!
If you play games like this againâ€¦
I will only play with your kids!
-Amen!
-I am blessed!
Sir, Atharva is coming here with his men.
Brother, he's directly coming here.
What will you tell him?
Are we trapped?
Aren't you Anand?
Not Anandâ€¦
I'm Vivek Anand Chakravarthy.
If you had a plan for this company,
I had my own scheme.
As long as I am here,
you cannot even touch the
key chain attached to the key of its gate.
Sir, isn't this the answer
you expected from me?
Sir, I am your â€œSwami.â€
I came for an interview
and you made me the CEO of the company.
Sir, it's me â€œSwami.â€
But didn't you just do what you were told?
Sir, what did you tell me?
I didn't expect the whole thing to get
altered as soon as I went on the stage.
I wouldn't mind if you kill me,
but I can't digest
getting deceived like that.
I cannot take it.
Why is he uttering our dialogues?
Why do you have to say that dialogue,
Mr. Viswam?
You told me it's just four lines but
expect me to give a speech of four pages?
Because I am a spontaneous actor,
I could improvise on the spot.
That too,
with action, emotion and modulation.
Otherwise, we'd have been caught, right?
Sir, he might have read
the paper meant for the CEO.
-What I meant wasâ€¦
-No, you listen!
I hate those who short-change their
words or swap papers.
I am hurt.
I am going home. Mummy!
Wait!
Actually, I--
I paused not because I wanted to hear you,
but because I have a lot more to say.
Sir, you are my God!
I kept your dad's photo as my DP.
I swapped Saibaba's photo on my ring
with your dad's photo.
I'm planning to go to Sabarimala.
Sir, I am crazy about you!
Oh, my!
-Sorry, Swamiâ€¦ I misunderstood you.
-Wellâ€¦
It's okay.
How is the new office?
It is huge.
Not that, how's the CEO's seat?
It is soft.
Very soft?
Pure soul.
Sir, I'm serious!
Why don't you have a seat and check
how soft and comfortable it is?
If "innocence" puts on a shirt and a pant,
it would look just like you.
You forgot to give it a suit!
How can you be so innocent, Swami?
I have the same feeling.
Okay, Swami.
I'm going to arrange the documentation
for transferring the company shares to us.
-Sign the papers.
-I am ready with the pen.
Okay, let's start.
Sir, one minute! One minute!
I wanted to give you this flower.
Especially this color.
Give this to your dad.
Okay.
The Oscar award is given
to every Tom, Dick, and Harry.
-Why don't you try for it?
-I'll try next year.
Hey, Vikram!
When did you arrive?
-Morning, brother.
-All good?
Brother, what is the problem with JP?
Not just JP,
but someone else
also has an eye on our company.
That day, in the mortuary,
two phone calls were made.
Sir, JP thinks his men murdered Anand
and not us.
Sir, nobody knows the truth about you.
Let's find out about the other person.
-Sanjay.
-Sir.
Sign here.
-What is it, Dad?
-We have to pay a salary to Swami.
Why did you tie it below the waist?
My waist, my wish.
Hey, get your hand off me.
My hand, my wish.
What if I say this to my husband?
Who is he?
Anand!
Can Anand grab you
and pull you closer like this?
Can he kiss you like this?
I'm not as soft as him.
When he's not around,
I'm not that soft eitherâ€¦
What are you thinking about?
Finish the sentence.
Well, I'm just wondering
why your hand stopped at my waist.
Oh, God! I knew you were seasoned!
I can be as seasoned as you like.
In the Balaji Temple
At those auspicious moments
When the plait is lifted
And you tie the knot
And unbeknownst to others
You blink at me!
Yearning to see you, dear
And talk to you, dear
Want to touch you, darling
Want to kiss you, darling
Sounds great when you say so, baby
Multiplies love manifold, baby
I will build a new home on your cheeks
Or build a new nest in your embrace
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you something happens
My heart beats faster
My heart plays like DJ when you see me
It's so narrow at my curvature
Whether it's your fingers or spinning top
Your piercing glance driving me nuts
As you mount on my bosom, swing on
You count the sweat drops today
And change the bangles every day
While the jasmine flowers get crushed!
The sins that get washed away
While the bed bears all the brunt
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you something happens
My heart beats faster
My heart plays like DJ when you see me
Hey, you should get into the family way
And move to our place or your place
And hold twins in your hands
At the entrance
But I will always remain a child
Hey girl in your arms
I will cling to you forever
Hanging by your coat-tail
While you twirl up your whiskers
And I'll lose my month
Let's lose sleep until
The wee hours and go gaga on the bed
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you something happens
My heart beats faster
My heart plays like DJ when you see me
When I see you something happens
My heart beats faster
My heart plays like DJ when you see me
Dad, he's our innocent Swami.
Poor thing,
he just panicked after seeing the crowd
and the mike and made some promises.
He's your fan. Our work will be done.
He sent you a flower.
We should not keep
a person by our side who cannot
figure out whether we are fighting
a tiger or a jackal.
If you want
to know something about someone,
you should inquire
about him thoroughly.
His identity credentials are perfect.
Sir, this guy is different from him.
If something goes wrong,
we can correct it in business,
but we cannot in tyranny.
You should have told us only
after knowing about him completely.
And not by hearing about him.
A person who can't figure out whether
it's a tiger or a jackal inside a cave
can make you lose an empire,
not just your life if he's beside you.
He knew our strengths
and exploited our weaknesses.
Now he wants to clash with me.
I won't leave that Swami.
Ticket?
Sorry, Brother!
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?
Sir! Sir!
Sir! Thank you.
Stop it.
What happened, Dad?
I wanted my daughter
to be the daughter-in-law of Chakravarthy.
However, this Swami has become his son.
I intended to buy a ticket
for my daughter, but he won the lottery.
You have won the lottery
by killing your daughter's fiancÃ©e.
and bought her a husband
who'll rule over you.
You will go into a coma If I hit you.
Should I drive your car whilst in a coma?
Greetings, sir!
Thank you, sir!
Swami!
He isâ€¦
Dad, you please continue.
Okay?
I will take care.
It's okay. Yes.
Be careful.
Sir, please come.
You have come at the right time.
Why haven't you informed us that the
shares were being transferred to them?
I read a quote that says,
"Information is wealth."
After that, I stopped sharing
any information with anyone.
I didn't get you.
I agree that you guys are clever enough
to hand me two lakh rupees
and make away
with a 10,000 crore company.
But do you really think
I'm so gullible to give you
a 10,000 crore company just
for two lakh rupees?
So what?
I have informed Mr. Chakravarthy
about everything.
He promised
to give me 100 crore rupees
and distribute 50 percent shares
to the employees if it's okay with me.
I told him that if I get 100 crores,
why would I bother about who cuts any deal
with the employees or anyone?
My decisions are spontaneous, sir.
Hey, I will give you 200 crores. Stop
distributing the shares first.
So, even though there
was a chance to give me 200 crores,
you wanted to cheat me
with only two lakhs.
Hey, we can talk about that later.
First, stop this!
They also asked me to stop you both.
Hey!
Killing you is now
as easy as whistling for me.
How do you blow a whistle?
Recently, I became rich.
So, I'm keeping 30 people around me.
Sir, just say, yes.
I will finish him off.
You, stop it.
These folks are very excited
to wear new clothes
and burst the Diwali crackers
before the celebrations even start.
This is that eager-beaver batch.
So get ready for a blast, even
if there's a single shot from your end.
Even I would speak a lot
If I had 30 people backing me.
I'm not someone who depends
on people backing me.
I have set an example that even
if there is no backup, you can succeed.
Boys, relax.
Is it a joke to you?
If my dad finds out about this!
Hey, why are
you bringing nepotism into rowdyism?
Just tell me what you will do,
not your dad.
Nothing to show?
Okay, do one thing.
God created man with nine holes.
One is in the front at the top,
the second one behind and below.
There are two such holes at the bottom.
Clasp and cover them and get lost.
We will not move from here.
We will leave
only after putting an end to all this.
If needed, we'll even kill Chakravarthy.
The villain is coming out of him.
I wanted to deal without violence.
Hey, can you play some music
to divert my attention?
Are you going to join us, dude?
He seems to have no music sense.
Boys and girls! Put your shoes on!
Raise the volume!
Let's dance on some mass stuff.
Hey, play that "Gajuwaka Conductor" song
at a high volume.
My hair is disheveled
Still wet behind the ears
Work with both my hands
Like a Rising upland
I am not an ordinary woman, dear
Come on the Pulsar bike, dear
I am not an ordinary woman, dear
Come on the Pulsar bike, dear
During college hours
You beckon by blinking at me
When I said I won't come
You get angered
I am not an ordinary woman, dear
I won't come if you just call, dear
I am not an ordinary woman, dear
I won't come if you just call, dear
At the mangrove
You signal me with your eyes
You showed me jasmine
And grabbed me by hand
I am not an ordinary woman, dear
Won't let you take advantage, dear
I am not an ordinary woman, dear
Won't let you take advantage, dear
I am not an ordinary woman, dear
Come on the Pulsar bike, dear
I am not an ordinary woman, dear
Come on the Pulsar bike, dear
That Swami has made a fool of us.
He is not Swamiâ€¦ Anand.
Why will he act greedy for 100 crores,
when he is about to
get the whole company on a platter?
So, he is Anand.
I am toiling for my son,
he is also toiling as a son.
Dad, what do we do now?
Are all arrangements done
for your birthday?
Not thatâ€¦
I said I will give that
company as a gift to you.
People Mart CEO's birthday
must be on an epic scale.
So, get on it.
Leave the rest to me.
Leave.
Who is Swami?
Who is Anand?
-Hello?
-Hello, Anand.
JP here.
I need to talk to Swami.
Speak.
I am hurt, not because I lost
but because I got cheated.
Since nobody expects a man
to get nurtured in two homes.
You played your game.
Nowâ€¦
it's my turnâ€¦ to play.
Is your dad's name Vasudeva Rao?
Did he ever spank you
when you were small?
Maybe not.
But did you
ever see your dad beaten in public?
Hey, not possible.
But if you want to see it liveâ€¦
Live and exclusive
at Panjagutta Police Station.
So pretty.
JP? JP?
They are smashing your dad like a dog.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Go fast.
Hello, Swami?
I have to speak to Anand once.
-Tell me.
-Hello, sir.
I know you have two moms,
two dads, and two loves.
Now, you will know about two pains.
You have a nurse at home.
We have an injection at home
called Pancuronium Bromide.
I told the nurse that I will kill her
if she doesn't inject your dad with it.
The nurse said that your dad won't live
if she gives him that injection.
Go fast!
It works faster than you.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad! Dad!
Hello, Swami Vivek Anand Chakravarthy?
Are you taking Chakravarthy
to the hospital?
To stop you, I have kept 100 people.
You do one thing.
If you take a right you
will go to the hospital.
If you go straight, then you'll arrive
at the Panjagutta burial ground.
Anyway, we all need to go thereâ€¦
so better head straight to it.
Else, if you want to compromise,
I will wait at the station
with the shares papers.
Come silently and give your company shares
by signing the papers.
Then I will decide
whether both your dads will live or not.
What happened?
Who are these people?
You gave us jobs
when we were roaming the streets.
What's the point if even now
we're no use to you?
You please go, sir.
We will take care of your dad.
If he has 100 people to stop us,
we have 1000 people to save us.
Sir!
If you try to be a hero
you will see a wild villain in me.
Dad, are you okay?
The moment you touched my family,
God sent an OTP for your death.
Swami Vivek Anand Chakravarthy
is your one-time password.
Hit them!
-Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
-No! No!
You enjoyed all this while,
now it's my turn.
No!
No!
Don't do that!
Anand, please don't do this.
Listen to me. Give me those keys.
Please, Anand!
Atharva!
Hey, CI!
Just shoot him and get the keys here!
No! No!
Hey!
Hello, DGP sir.
Sir, you called at the right time.
Someone stormed the station
and started hitting me, sir.
Sir, send a battalion immediately.
Who is it?
Just a middle-class fellow
from the slums of Kukatpally sir.
That was earlier.
Now he is the CEO of People Mart company.
He wanted the station for an hour.
I gave itâ€¦
not because he has the moneyâ€¦
but because it's our mistake.
You gave this station
to JP to make a mistake.
But DGP gave it to me
to correct that mistake.
Now that has been corrected.
Suspend!
Anand, please leave him.
He looks like he's going to die.
Please!
Please, listen to me!
I know I have two moms,
two dads, and two loves.
But you have introduced me to two pains.
And when there are two sons,
don't we have the right
to seek revenge twice?
Sanjay!
Kill him!
Help!
Anandâ€¦
what you don't know is thatâ€¦
even if I leave,
there's another
baby villain who's eyeing your company.
He will--
My younger brother Vikram Chakravarthy!
What you
don't know is that he is the main villain.
I already knew his plan.
Move!
If he kills me and becomes the CEO,
he will be seen as
a villain by the employees.
Instead, if he makes you kill me,
he will become a hero.
I was waiting all this while so that you
finish off Anand and make my son the CEO.
Anand shouldn't become the CEO,
my son should.
JP, you're the original child villain
of this game.
Do you know
why I am saying all this at this time?
I am killing time.
And I am killing your son.
You tell me what you want.
I won't interfere with your company again.
I promise you.
Dad!
Leave him alone. Please
It will take just a second
to kill you both.
It's called violence
if you kill ten people,
but it's just business
if you employ ten people.
Let's do business, JP.
Not violence.
Dad, let's go.
Brother, don't worry. He will be fine.
As long as you are there,
no harm will come to him or the company.
Sir, here.
-All papers are here?
-Yes, sir.
Here's my resignation letter as the CEO.
Here are the papers and signature letter,
you'd need to become the CEO.
These are company passwords and
security secrets.
These are our shares and charity details.
Since I had all these things with me,
a villain was born in you.
I've given up all of this to you.
Will you give your uncle
the childhood Vikram that he doted on?
Will you become the Vikram
that Mr. Chakravarthy
has always known, instead of the Vikram
that is in front of me?
Anand.
Dad.
JP's problem has been solved.
When I'm asking him to sign as CEO,
why is he asking me to continue as one?
Who?
Anand?
I couldn't even convince
the one I raised.
Do you think he'll listen
to you and become the CEO?
No matter how much I tell him,
he says, he is a son but not an heir.
To make you sit in my place,
he sent you
to the best university for your master's.
When I had health issuesâ€¦
I thought of making you the CEO.
But JP created some problems,
so he stood in the frontline
to shield you from JP.
He risked his life
and became the CEO.
Do you know why?
So that by the time you are ready to sign,
you will have no problem anywhere.
He could have sat next to the king,
but he chose
to stand in the front like a soldier.
Can we see anyone like him anywhere?
When I die if I had
to look back at my greatest achievements.
It wouldn't be the thousands of crores,
or the thousands of people employed,
nor the doctorates or the Padma Shri.
It is him and him alone.
Parents give birth to children,
but God allows them to become parents.
Thank you for being my son
and calling me Dad.
Thank you, son.
Thank you.
I lived successfully.
-Now I will die successfully.
-Dad.
Sorry, brother.
Don't apologize.
Just remember that we are a family.
Give me one kilogram of gongura.
They sell gongura in bundles,
not in kilograms.
-I'd like four bundles.
-Come, dear.
-Mother Yashoda, get used to this.
-Okay, dear.
-Dad, I got the job!
-Really? Congratulations!
-Coffee.
-Wait, let me freshen up.
-One minute. Anand.
-Yes, Dad?
Mr. Subramanyam's eldest son
has finished his engineering course.
He's looking for a job.
Okay, ask him to come.
We'll figure something out.
Okay.
-Yeah, tell me.
-Hi, Pranavi madam.
How are you doing?
Have you been busy?
You are the CEO of such a big company.
So, why did it take so long
for Swami to land a job?
If someone comes on alternate days,
and works only 15 days a month,
then who will give them a job?
-Oh!
-That's why.
Sir, your daughter will
soon get married and leave.
What will you do then?
What will I do?
After marrying off my daughter,
I will be trapped alone
in the company of my wife.
I will die at the hands of my wife.
But I will kill you
for all the dialogues
I've been hearing from you.
These are the only two things I'll do.
-What? You will kill me?!
-Yes.
How many times have you told this joke?
I can go to any extent in a fit of temper.
So, will you go for a walk?
-What do I look like?
-You look a little blurry.
I have bad eyesight.
Hey! I will cut you into pieces!
Madam, get those drumsticks!
He will cut them into pieces!
Hey!
Hey, Father-in-law!
-How much are you paying him every month?
-Twenty-five thousand rupees.
You're paying him so much to get roasted!
You are a specimen!
-Perhaps it is my destiny.
-Sure.
