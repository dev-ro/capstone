Hello there, hello there.
Is something wrong?
My wife and I found him
lying dead in the yew alley,
Face downward.
What did you do then?
I hurried across the moor,
to fetch the doctor.
Dr. Mortimer.
He was at dinner with Ms.
Stapleton and her brother.
Very well, Barryman, that's all.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Mortimer,
To what do you attribute
the death of Sir Charles?
Heart failure, sir.
I might add that for sometime,
Sir Charles was in a
highly nervous state.
Worried.
Something was preying
on his mind.
Did he confide to you what
was preying on his mind?
Well...
No.
Well, what about those
footprints, Dr. Mortimer?
As though Sir Charles had been
tiptoeing back toward the house.
I examined them myself,
and as a man of science..
So did I, Mr. Stapleton,
more likely Sir Charles
was running.
Running? Running from what?
If you please, gentlemen,
one at a time.
Why don't you tell the
truth, all of you?
Tell all you know.
Silence, Mr. Franklin,
you've already testified.
You were not there, no nothing
whatever of this matter
Nevertheless, I insist he was murdered.
Murdered I tell you.
That will do, sir
that will do
There were no marks on the body
of any kind, Dr. Mortimer?
None.
Then as his physician what would you
say was the cause of Sir Charles' death?
Most empathically,
a heart failure, sir.
Such then Gentlemen is the
verdict of this Coroner's court.
Call it what you like,
Sir Charles was murdered,
there's more than one
person in this room
knows I speak the truth.
I am blessed if I know why on
earth you want all these clippings.
about this Baskerville fellow.
I have an idea Watson
that young Sir Henry
isn't destined for a very
long existence in this world.
What?
My conjecture is that
he'll be murdered!
Murdered?
It will be very interesting to see if
my deductions are accurate.
Oh, Mr. Holmes!
While you out a Gentleman
called to see you and left this.
He asked you to give it to me?
Oh no, he just left it
there by mistake I imagine.
Dr. Mortimer.
He didn't leave his name, sir.
No, it's here on the stick,
Mrs. Hudson.
Oh is it, I didn't notice.
Do you know any Dr.
Mortimer, Watson?
No, what did he want?
He didn't say, sir.
What do you make of it, Watson?
Why should I make anything of it?
The fellow came to see you.
What kind of a fellow?
Let me hear you reconstruct him.
From his walking stick.
By our usual method of
elementary observation.
I should say that Dr.
Mortimer is a successful man,
well esteemed.
Good, excellent.
I should say that he does a great
deal of his visiting on foot
because the iron
fellow is worn down.
Perfectly sound.
Let's have a look
at this inscription.
"From his friends of the C.C.H."
I should say that is
something about a hunt.
Really, Watson, you've
excelled yourself.
Has anything escaped me?
Most everything my dear fellow.
A person to a Doctor is more likely to
come from a Hospital than a hunt,
and when the letters 'CC' appears
before the Hospital,
the name "Charing Cross Hospital"
rather obviously presents itself.
Well, you may be right.
Furthermore, I'd say that Dr. Mortimer
had a small practice in the country
and was the owner of a dog.
How can you tell that?
Quite simple, from
the teeth marks.
Look you can see for yourself.
A rather large dog, I'd say
and unless I'm mistaken,
Dr. Mortimer will call on us
again in a few moments.
Rubbish, Holmes, rubbish
How the devil can
you deduce that?
Well, as his left his stick,
Isn't reasonable to presume that
he'll come back and get it?
Dr. Mortimer, sir.
Mr. Holmes?
Yes, come in Dr. Mortimer.
I took the liberty of
calling upon you.
And left your stick.
Oh, so I did.
Thank you so much.
A presentation I see?
Yes sir, from Charing
Cross Hospital.
This is my friend
Dr. Watson.
Of course.
How do you do, sir?
Mr. Holmes, you're the one
man in all England
who can help me.
Won't you sit?
Thank you.
A friend of mine is
in grave danger.
May I enquire his name?
Sir Henry Baskerville,
heir to the estate
of Baskerville Hall.
I am in mortal fear
Sir Henry's life will be
snuffed out
Why what makes you think that?
I have information which leads me
to believe that for centuries past
every Baskerville whose inherited
the estates has met with a
violent and sudden death.
But as I recall it, Sir Charles
died from natural causes,
heart failure.
Apparently, that was the verdict
of the Coroner, in which
I, Sir Charles
Physician concurred
but there was one point which I
kept back from the police,
from everybody.
Yes?
About fifty yards from where
Sir Charles fell dead
were footprints.
A man's or woman's?
Mr. Holmes, they were the
footprints of a gigantic hound!
A hound?
Why didn't you report it?
Not a soul would have believed it.
During the night it rained
and in the morning
the marks were
completely obliterated.
But I saw them.
As clearly as I see you
and then a few days ago
as one of the
executors of the estate
I found this:
This old document.
Legend of the hound
of the Baskervilles.
Let me read it
to you, Mr. Holmes.
It's quite short, I won't
bore you, I promise.
Yes, please go on.
In the time of the great
rebellion about 1650,
Baskerville Manor was held
by Hugo of that name.
A profane and Godless man.
One Michaelmas this Hugo stole
down upon a neighbouring farm
and carried off the
daughter of the house.
He locked her in
an upper chamber.
and while Hugo and his
friends were carousing
as was their nightly custom
Such a cuddlesome little winch
never existed before I swear.
Cheeks soft as velvet and a
form so wondrously rounded...
- Tell us more
- What happened then?
Where was I?
The form you were saying.
No need to cry out I told her
Hugo will not hurt you.
With that I whisked her up on the
saddle I covered with me cloak
and we were off like the wind.
You brought her here?
- to the manor?
- Where is she?
Go fetch her, Hugo.
Easier said than done
hey, Hugo?
How will he fetch her
if she isn't here?
Ah, she isn't eh?
Come on, I'll show you.
You think she's
really in there?
Yes, he did.
May we come in my sweet?
These drunken sots
will give Hugo...
There is no girl!
Gone.
Now he says she's gone.
Out of my way.
What ails him?
Tim, Gary.
- Yes, Sir Hugo
- What's wrong sir?
She's gone. The winch.
Well, don't stand there gaping
go bring my mare.
Yes, sir.
What's wrong?
I've never seen him
in such a rage.
Where's he gone?
- Let's follow him.
- Let's go Roderick
Very well.
Come on Matthew?
Hold the stir you blockhead.
I'll give my soul to the
devil for that winch.
Hear how he thinks he'd sell his
soul to the devil for that winch.
Well may he find her and wed her
then the devil will have his soul.
On and on they rode until
suddenly they
came upon the body
of the girl.
Dead.
Then from just over a rise
they heard sounds
so hideous that
the blood froze in their veins.
and, looking up, they beheld
Before we could get at him
Sir Hugo was dead his body
literally torn to shreds.
Such is the history of the hound
that has cursed the
Baskerville family ever since.
Many having been unhappy
in their deaths,
that have been sudden, violent
and mysterious.
Well Mr. Holmes?
Interesting,
very interesting.
What do you think?
I don't know.
But Sir Henry is arriving from
Canada tomorrow.
Please understand my dilemma,
my responsibility
I was Sir Charles' best friend
My duty is to protect that boy.
If I should take him down
there to Baskerville Hall
and if anything
happened to him...
What I suggest, Dr. Mortimer,
is when Sir Henry arrives
you bring him here.
Oh, thank you, thank
you, Mr. Holmes,
You don't know what a load
you have taken off my mind.
Good night, Dr. Watson.
Good night, sir.
You left your stick again.
Oh, thank you.
By the by, Dr. Mortimer,
Do you have a dog?
I have no dog.
Then how do you
account for these marks?
Evidently the teeth
marks of a dog.
I used to have a dog,
a small Spaniel,
but it died.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well Holmes, what
do you make or it?
Do you think there
is anything in it?
Good heavens you are not going to start
scratching on that infernal thing are ya?
Dear old Watson!
Good bye, Sir Henry.
If you ever go back to Canada
be sure you sail with us.
Thanks, you've all been wonderful.
The very best of luck, sir.
The same to you.
This way, Sir Henry.
Thank you, Sir.
- and you and you.
- Thank you sir.
Sir Henry, it's too bad
it's all over...
just when you and Betsy Ann
were really getting to know each other.
Oh, but we are going to see one another
in London, aren't we Sir Henry?
Oh, I should love to but I have to
go down to the country, unfortunately.
To your ancestral
estate how exciting
Perhaps Betsy Ann if you are very
good Sir Henry will ask us
to visit him.
Of course, yes.
We are staying at the Savoy.
- Don't forget.
- I won't
- Bye
- Good bye.
Sir Henry?
Yes
I am Dr. Mortimer,
your uncle was my best friend.
How do you do?
Thank you for coming to get me.
Not at all, my dear boy,
You have a pleasant trip?
Splendid, thank you.
I've taken rooms for you at the
Northumberland Hotel, where I'm stopping.
Fine.
I assume you will be staying
in London for a few days.
Yes, I haven't seen it
since I was a boy.
Thank you, sir.
Northumberland Hotel.
Sir Charles' death was a great
personal loss to me.
I was more than his doctor...
What's this?
What are those words?
"As you value your life or
your reason
keep away from the Moor"
You mind, Sir Henry.
No, not at all.
What do you make
of it, Mr. Holmes?
Why do you thing that last word
is printed in ink?
Oh, that's simple enough the
words have been snipped from
the London Times, that's
evident from the typography.
But the word 'moor'
is an unusual word
Your correspondent evidently couldn't
find it in the newspaper.
You'll admit Dr. Mortimer, there is
nothing supernatural about this?
Supernatural?
Tell me Sir Henry has anything else
unusual happened to you today?
since your arrival in London?
I can't think of anything,
unless you say that losing one
of your boots is unusual.
You lost one of your boots?
Yes, brand new ones too
never had them on.
I put them outside the door
to be cleaned
and when I went to fetch them
there was only one there.
Brand new boots and you put
them out to be cleaned?
They were tanned ones, Dr. Watson.
It prevents them from scratching
to have them polished first.
Now will you please tell me
what this is all about?
Dr. Mortimer bringing me
here to see you?
this letter?
It's about you, Sir Henry,
your inheritance
and Baskerville Hall.
Dr. Mortimer thinks that it might
not be safe for you to go down there.
Safe?
On account of a hound.
A wild, supernatural monster
that has cursed you Baskerville's
for the last two or three hundred years.
Ah, ho, that sounds grand
a family ghost eh?
Why didn't you tell this
before, Dr. Mortimer?
Well, Mr. Holmes... suggested.
He is going to tell you
about it now, Sir Henry.
Take him back to the
hotel, Dr Mortimer
Show him that old document
Tell him everything, the whole business.
I'll join you a little later.
Come on we'll stroll back,
you can tell me on the way.
This is not something to joke
about, Sir Henry. Believe me.
See you presently.
Good night.
What's up?
Come on, Watson.
What's up now?
Where are we going?
You'll see soon enough.
Not a moment to lose.
Newspaper.
Get your evening paper!
Keep your eye on that Hansom.
This letter dates back to about 1650.
Paper,
Get your evening paper!
Evening paper, sir.
Get your evening paper?
tells all the latest news.
Thank you sir.
Evening paper.
A dissident, drunken fellow.
Look out stop!
Whip up cabbie, whip up.
Very good, sir.
Who was it?
I don't know but it is
just as I expected.
Haven't we better hurry
on and warn them?
No, no, no they are not
in any danger now.
Here is the number of that Hansom.
Find out from Scotland
Yard who the cabbie is
and if you can fetch
him along to the hotel.
I'll do my best.
"Northumberland Hotel"
Well, now that Dr. Mortimer
has told you everything...
What have you decided?
To go there, of course.
Good that's what I
thought you'd say.
If Dr. Mortimer will only
guarantee that this
supernatural hound of
his will really appear,
I'd go already.
Don't say that my boy.
Sounds like a bogey
story they tell kids
to frighten them at night
isn't it, Mr. Holmes?
Yes, rather.
It might interest you to know however
that you were shadowed from my house.
Shadowed?
Yes, and probably have been ever
since you arrived in London.
By whom?
I don't know.
A man in a Hansom.
He must have seen me run after him
and had the cabbie dash off.
By the by, did you ever
discovered your mislaid boot?
No, hello?
The browns ones here but
one of the black ones is gone.
I'll ring for the Chambermaid
perhaps she can explain.
Yes, do.
Now why should anyone
want to take an odd boot?
and then exchange a brand
new one for an old one?
Can you explain it Mr. Holmes?
No, I can't.
Come in.
Did you ring, sir?
Yes about that boot of mine?
Oh, I have not found it yet, sir.
I've made enquiries all over the hotel.
Well it's back the brown one, but
now one of my black ones is gone.
Oh, sir, that is odd!
Who else except yourself has
access to this apartment?
Only the housekeeper, sir and she
wouldn't do a thing like that
No, no, of course not.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I'll do my best to find your boot.
Okay, thanks.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, Dr. Watson.
I've got him!
Come on in Clayton. Come this way.
This is John Clayton, number 2704.
- How do you do?
- How do you do Clayton?
Won't you sit down?
I won't keep you long.
It's good of you to come
Thank you, sir.
Now, Clayton I wish you would
tell us who your fair was
that watched a certain house
on Baker Street this evening
and later followed
these two gentleman.
Well I'll tell you
you know as much as I do, sir.
Not quite as much I hope.
The gent said he was a detective, sir.
Oh he did?
Yes, sir.
How would you describe
this gentleman, Clayton?
I suppose... about 35 years of age, sir
and dressed like a toff
and a small black beard.
And the color of his eyes?
I can't say, sir.
I see.
When did he tell you that
he was a detective?
At the station, sir.
When he gave me the 2 guineas,
of what he promised me.
Did he tell you his name?
Yes, sir.
What did he say it was?
Sherlock Holmes.
What?
It's the name what he gave me, sir.
Sherlock Holmes.
Well, whoever it is, at least
has a sense of humour.
Here Clayton, here is
something for your trouble.
Thank you, thank you kindly, sir.
Is there anything else I can
tell you, sir?
Nothing at all I think.
All right, sir. Good day, sir.
Good day, gentlemen.
Well Mr. Holmes,
have we progressed.
Do you think?
Perhaps.
Tell me, Sir Henry, when were you
planning to go down to Dartmoor?
Immediately, tomorrow.
I am really awfully keen
to see the old place.
You will accompany us, Mr. Holmes?
I would like to very
much, Dr. Mortimer,
but unfortunately I have some
rather pressing business here in London.
Of course, there is no need.
Please don't think me ungrateful,
Dr. Mortimer
I do appreciate your
concern for me,
but this story of the hound
is nonsense.
As for that silly letter
and all the rest of
it I am sure it can all
quite easily be explained.
I quite agree with
you, Sir Henry,
All the same if you don't mind,
I'd like to ask Dr. Watson
to go down with you.
What's that?
If you don't mind, Dr. Watson
Gladly, if you care to come.
Of course, I'd be delighted.
Good. Well, thank you Dr. Watson,
and thank you, sir.
and we'll stalk the hound together.
Don't take it too lightly, Sir Henry.
Well I must be going.
Mr. Holmes?
Yes, Dr. Mortimer.
About that person
calling himself Sherlock Holmes?
Very interesting, Dr. Mortimer
Keep me posted, Watson.
Write me daily reports.
To the smallest detail, Holmes.
Fine, I give him into
your care, Sir Henry.
Guard him well. Good night.
Guard me well, I like that!
God!
Here we are, Sir Henry,
on famous Dartmoor
and what a history it has.
You see those rocks over there?
Actually they are stone houses
built by Neolithic man
50 or 100,000 years ago.
You don't suppose the Baskervilles
go back that far.
And over there, beyond that hill,
those dark spots
That's the great Grimpen Mire.
As treacherous a morass
as exists anywhere.
Thousands of lives have
been sucked down
into its bottomless depths.
Cheerful little spot.
Fascinating.
Oh, it is, Sir Henry and mysterious!
No wonder the people
about here have
such odd beliefs.
Some will tell you that nothing
ever really dies upon the Moor.
and after a time
one gets to believe it.
Really?
You believe that?
Of course not.
If I believe all the
legends about this place
I wouldn't live here.
I wouldn't have the courage.
And now if you'll look
Baskerville Hall, the home
of your ancestors, Sir Henry.
How are you, Barryman?
Very well, thank you, sir.
Thank you.
This is Barryman, the butler,
Sir Henry and Mrs. Barryman.
Welcome, Sir Henry.
Welcome to Baskerville Hall.
Thank you.
Barryman was with your
Uncle most of his life
as was his father before him.
Well I hope you will
be just as happy with me.
Thank you, Sir Henry.
Baskerville Hall.
Just as it has always been,
Sir Henry.
Your uncle did some
modernizing upstairs.
but down here nothing has been
added or taken away since Sir Hugo's time.
Well I wouldn't say it was the
most cheerful spot I have ever seen.
I beg your pardon, sir
what time do wish dinner, sir?
Early I think.
Dr. Mortimer has to
drive home.
Tell the Coachman to have
the carriage ready after dinner.
I'll tell him, sir.
Now I suppose you'll
like to freshen up
there is hot water in your room, sir.
I'll show the way.
Thank you.
Be careful, sir, these steps are
a bit in need of repair.
My dear Holmes - we arrived
tonight shortly after dark
Dr. Mortimer stayed
for dinner.
I wish I could describe
the dreadful eeriness of this place
I didn't want to startle you,
I thought you might be asleep.
What is it?
Come quickly someone's
prowling around.
What are you doing, Barryman.
Oh, nothing sir, it was the window.
The window?
Yes, sir I was just seeing
that it was fastened.
What does it matter whether
it is fastened or not?
A window on the second floor.
I go around every night
seeing that they are fastened.
Sir Charles always insisted upon it.
Well that sounds reasonable enough.
Well if it is properly
fastened now, Barryman
You can get back to bed.
Yes, sir, thank you.
Do you see anything?
Nothing
Nothing, except a pinpoint of
a light a long way off,
over there by the Craggs.
Well, keep your eye on
that point of light
and tell me what happens.
Do you see anything now?
It's gone now.
There it is again.
and there it goes.
Just as I thought.
Barryman was signalling someone.
Come on get some clothes
we'll find out.
It's still there.
Yes
Try not to lose sight of it.
Crouch down here, whoever
it is may come back.
What about getting a little
further away from that light?
Up there.
Good idea.
Stop.
Are you mad.
Whoever it is, knows his way
among these rocks, we don't!
Who the devil can it be?
You were right about Barryman.
Yes, but what connection can
there possibly be between
that horrible creature
and Barryman?
You know I have a half a mind
to fire the fellow in the morning.
Then notify the police,
and let them shadow him.
No it's the last thing Holmes
would want us to do.
Our job is to watch, Barryman
watch him like a hawk.
Come on, let's get back.
What do you think it is?
What does it sound like, to you?
Well... if we were back in
London, this would seem ridiculous.
Let's get on.
Look here doctor, you don't
believe that nonsense do you?
Of course not.
No more than you do.
"What was it? That's what
we must find out
the wind?
a bird?
Or was it the hound?"
Good morning.
Good morning, Sir Henry.
So that's our famous moor, eh?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Where's Sir Henry?
He went out, sir.
Where?
Across the moor.
Didn't I tell you to
let me know immediately
if Sir Henry ever
ventured out there alone.
I know but I only just found
out from my wife.
"Sherlock Holmes Esq. 221 B
Baker Street, London"
Hello there!
Oh, forgive my
shouting at you, Dr. Watson.
My name is Stapleton, live
just across the moor.
But how did you
know my name, sir?
From Dr. Mortimer,
one or our neighbours.
Ah, yes.
How is, Sir Henry?
He is very well, thank you.
We were a bit worried that he
might decide not to come here
after the rumours that followed
the sad death of Sir Charles.
Has Mr. Holmes come
to any conclusion yet?
I really can't say.
Is he going to honour
us with a visit?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Well if I can be of any help I
do hope you will call upon me.
I know this place pretty well.
Thank you but I don't think I
shall be needing any help.
Wonderful place this moor.
From a Scientist point of view
there is nothing like it.
Vast, barren, mysterious
Do you see those bright
green spots over there?
It seems a little more
fertile than the rest.
Fertile? That's the
great Grimpen mire.
One false step means death
While only yesterday one of the
moor ponies wondered into it.
Turn me sick with horror
to see it struggling
and the sound of its screams...
What's that?
Oh, that. The people around here
say it is the hound.
Surely you don't believe such rut.
Bogs make queer noises.
Or perhaps it's a Bittern booming.
A Bittern?
Yes, a very rare bird,
practically extinct...
If anything is extinct on
the moor.
Stop! Stop!
Look out, stop!
That was a voice, a woman's voice.
Thank heavens you heard me.
Another few yards you would
have been into that mire.
It looks innocent doesn't it?
But only yesterday a little
moor pony got into it
and that was the end of it.
Well, thank you for shouting at me.
You're Sir Henry?
Yes
I suppose I should say
welcome, Sir Henry.
but I'm afraid it wouldn't be sincere.
Oh that's understandable.
A stranger coming here and taking
the place of someone you were fond of.
Oh, it's not that.
No, tell me what it is it?
Sound silly I know, but...
Oh it's not that
ridiculous hound legend?
I never used to
believe those things
until I came to live down here.
But you do now.
You're rich, you can go
anywhere you want to.
There's so many other places
to live in the world,
interesting places.
Just now I find this place
very interesting.
Why hello, Beryl!
Hello!
Dr. Watson, my step-sister
Miss Stapleton.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Hello, Doctor.
And this I'm sure must be...
- Sir Henry, my brother.
- How are you?
I was just telling Dr. Watson,
how delighted we are
you decided to come here
I am here and to stay.
Well that's splendid, you know it
has been quite dull down here
since the halls been closed.
It's wide open now, especially
to friends of my Uncle.
You must both come
and dine with me.
You must come to us first.
Yes, what about tomorrow night?
You and Dr. Watson
Will invite the neighbours
over to meet you.
Of course you already
know, Dr. Mortimer
the only other one
is old Mr. Franklin.
Who's he?
Oh, wait until you
meet him, Sir Henry
He'll bring suit against you,
I warn you.
What on earth for?
He'll find something.
Suing people is a passion with him.
I look forward to meeting him.
All right tomorrow night.
Thank you.
And thank you again for rescuing me.
Goodbye.
"There is something about this
fellow Stapleton I don't like.
However, his charming
step-sister has invited us
to dine with them at their
house, across the moor,
near the village"
And were it not a personal insult
to Sir Henry, I would never of
come here this evening
Oh but why, Mr. Franklin?
I is a stickler for convention
I'm not in the habit of
breaking bread with my host.
on the eve of persecuting him.
Great heavens!, What crime
have I committed now?
A most gruesome one, Mr. Stapleton.
That of body snatching.
What?
You're a body snatcher, sir.
a ghoul, a despoiler of graves!
Oh, come, come Mr. Franklin,
that is a very serious charge!
Beryl, re-fill Mr. Franklin's
glass will you?
Thank you, my dear.
And an excellent vintage it is too
but if you're implying
that I am tipsy, sir.
Oh, of course he's not.
Tell us more Mr. Franklin,
Whose body has
Mr. Stapleton been snatching?
According to my evidence, Sir
Mr. Stapleton was seen digging
among the old stone huts
in the moor and removed
from there a skull.
Oh, that!
A most interesting relic, Sir
Henry of Neolithic man.
I'll show it to you after dinner.
50,000 years old, if it is a day.
Nonetheless, sir you removed
it from the grave
without the consent
of the next of kin
and according to British law, that
constitutes body snatching.
Deny that if you can.
But what good will it do you
to prosecute Mr. Stapleton?
None, sir
I have no interest in the matter.
I act entirely from a
sense of public duty.
If you care to drop by my house some
day and take a tippler of wine with me
I'd be glad to tell you a thing
or two about everybody here.
About him
Prowling the Grimpen mire at night.
And why he takes
her with him.
Oh, there is no secret about us
As you know, I dabble
a bit in the Occult.
Mrs. Mortimer has very strong
mediumistic qualities.
She finds the old caves in the moor
particularly conducive to
psychic phenomena
Very interesting.
Have you ever tried to
communicate with my uncle
since his death?
Oh, yes, on several occasions.
With no success.
But if my wife would
consent to a séance tonight
while you, Sir Henry, are
present, we might...
No, no, James not tonight, please.
Perhaps some other time.
Shall we have coffee in the
drawing room?
If you and Dr. Watson would
care to see my little collection...
- Oh, yes, the skull. - Yes, well in here.
- I would like to very much.
Quite a museum.
Oh, a very modest little collection.
But this one really is quite a treasure.
You will observe its
unusual cranial index
Gentlemen, gentlemen, my wife
has consented, she's agreed to a séance.
Splendid!
Please, come at once.
Now then if you will all get chairs
arrange yourselves naturally,
comfortably here by the fire
As Shakespeare says,
"You can call spirits
from the vasty deep,
but will they answer"
I don't answer scoffers or sceptics.
If that's your attitude, Mr. Franklin
perhaps you wouldn't mind leaving us.
Oh, I am sure Mr. Franklin
didn't mean to doubt.
Of course I doubt, and I ask you to keep
a civil tongue in your head, Dr. Mortimer.
Ordering me out from
under the roof of my host
is grounds for a very,
nasty, little lawsuit.
Oh, come now, Mr. Franklin,
sit down by me.
Now, tonight we may
communicate with Sir Charles.
Find out what he feared so greatly.
What he was running away from.
Now Jennifer you sit here, please.
Sir Henry here.
Oh, would you please
put out those lights?
Certainly.
Stapleton, that light, please.
Dr. Watson.
Now,
if you all keep quiet,
sit quite naturally.
Sir Henry, your hand please
Sir Charles can you speak to us?
Let us know if you're present.
There are things that
only you can explain.
Speak to us, Sir Charles
if you're here.
There are things only
you can tell us.
Sir Charles, can you speak to us?
Let us know if you're present.
There are things that
only you can tell us.
Speak to us, Sir Charles, if
you are here.
There are things that only
you can explain.
That sound I have heard it before.
It's nothing, nothing but the wind.
Or a Bittern, I was telling Dr. Watson
only yesterday about it.
Sir Charles,
What happened that night?
What is it you feared?
Tell us, Sir Charles.
Of all the weird terrible things
that have happened on the moor.
Listen, there it is again.
I can't stand it, will someone
put on the lights, please.
I tell you it is nothing.
Nothing but the wind.
Mr. Franklin,
What do you think it was?
The hound, of course.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Any fool would know that.
James, get my cape, take me home.
Very well, my dear.
Dr. Watson, can I give you
and Sir Henry a lift?
No thank you, we
have our own carriage.
You're trembling.
That wasn't the wind we heard;
I've heard that sound before, often
that's what I tried to tell
you yesterday on the moor.
That's why I wish
you hadn't come here.
But sounds can't hurt you.
It doesn't matter what they are
or where they come from
You don't know.
Oh, you have got to get all that
nonsense out of your head, Beryl!
I wish I could.
You're going to. I am going to
make it my business to see that you do.
You have been alone too much
there's nothing to do down here
That's the trouble.
I am going to change all that..
If you let me.
will go fishing together, riding...
You like riding?
Yes, I do.
Good, will start
tomorrow, shall we?
Yes, thanks.
Fine.
I'll ride over for
you in the morning.
Are you coming, Sir Henry?
Right, Doctor.
- Good night.
- Good night.
"My dear Homes - Nothing to report
except that I am quite convinced that
that Sir Henry is head
over heels in love with...
Hello!
Hello Beryl.
Well, where shall we go today?
There's one place we haven't been
- High Tor.
- Fine.
That's where all the old ruins are.
You know Jack says they
are all 50,000 years old.
That sounds interesting.
And you can still see the
remains of their stone huts.
All right, good.
Those flattish stones over
there are graves.
Oh, those huge bronze monoliths,
are remains of their temples.
Doesn't anybody know
who they were...
or what they look like?
Jack has some theory about them.
But anyway they
must be very primitive.
Living on roots and
dressing in skins.
But still laughing and
dreaming just as we do.
I wonder how many
times some young savage
brought his bride to this very hut?
said "take your hat off
darling, this is home"
You know this is probably where
she cooked his first meal for him.
What a yell he must of let
out when she burnt it up.
And now they are quite forgotten.
Just as we will be too, one day.
Do you suppose when a man
met a girl that he liked
he had to wait a respectably long
time before he dared tell her?
or are things like
that sudden, natural?
I would like to think
things were like that.
Beryl, that's the way
they are with me.
Oh, but we've only known each
other such a little while.
There you see, convention, custom.
We can't even be ourselves
when we want to be.
Why is that?
You know I used to come
down here quite often
and explore these old caves
when Jack and I first came to live here.
I didn't have a fear
of the moor then.
And you've none
now, that's all gone.
When I'm with you it's gone. I
seem to forget it, laughing and talking.
But when I am alone
it all comes back to me.
At night I still wake up
trembling as if in my sleep
I could hear those awful noises...
then it get's bad as ever.
Oh, I think of you and I
wish you weren't here.
Oh, don't say that!
I wish you were in
London or in Canada.
But even if I wanted to go back
to London or Canada, I couldn't.
Why not?
You know why.
You must know why.
I can't go anywhere now
unless you come with me.
Oh, Henry!
Would you mind
pausing for a minute.
I am afraid I have lost my way.
Hello, Doctor, Sir Henry
and I were just...
We were, getting engaged.
Engaged, splendid!
May I congratulate you both!
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Who is that?
It seems we didn't pick
a very secluded spot.
What do you want?
Just crossing the moors, sir.
Just crossing the moor
I be
I be peddling my wares, sir.
I must having something here
would interest you, sir.
How about a nice
mouth organ, sir?
No, thank you.
Here is something an old
squire like you could use, sir.
A whistle.
A whistle for calling
your sheep dog.
Calling my what...?
Sheep dog, sir.
A regular charmer, sir.
You'll hear it for miles around, sir.
Take it away and yourself with it.
How about some
scent for the Lady, sir?
That will do, be off and
about your business.
All right, all right,
I ain't doing no harm.
I ain't' doing no harm.
You know that's what
I hate about this moor.
There is always
something strange.
Look, he's limping on
the other foot now!
"Dr. Watson- if you want to
hear something to your advantage
come at once to the stone hut
southeast edge of
the Grimpen mire"
Barryman.
Yes, sir.
Who delivered this note?
No one, sir.
I found it slipped
under the front door.
Thank you.
Barryman, is Sir Henry home?
No, sir. He has gone
across the moor.
Oh, sorry I missed him. Did
Dr. Watson go with him?
No, sir.
Oh, thank you, Barryman.
I'll tell Sir Henry you called, sir.
Yes, do.
"Sit down and make
yourself comfortable"
Was it you who sent
me that communication?
I did, sir.
Out with it.
Whatever it is you
want me to hear?
I only want you to hear
this zither, sir.
Zither?
They don't come no finer, sir.
What blasted impertinence.
Getting me out here...
Look here my man
You're up to something.
I, I only ask you to try it, sir.
Be careful! This thing is loaded.
Who are you?
Well, I might ask
the same of you, sir.
Trawling around the moor,
spying out on everybody.
That's my business, to spy.
Oh, it is, is it?
Yes, and if you want
to know who I am,
I'll tell you.
Who are you?
I am Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes, the detective?
Yes, and now perhaps you realize
why I can't be hoodwinked.
Oh, sir, sir, that
changes everything.
Now who are you? Quick.
Well in that case, sir
my name must be Watson.
Holmes.
How are you, my dear fellow?
A fine detective you are,
calling yourself Sherlock Holmes.
So you have been down here
on the moor all the time.
That's a fine way to treat
me, I must say!
Send me down here,
let me think you are in
London, working
on that blackmail case...
let me sit up half the night,
writing those blasted reports
Here are the reports my dear
Watson and very valuable they were to.
I made arrangements to have
them forwarded onto me.
A dirty trick which I'll not forget.
ah but a very necessary trick
If I'd come down here
with you and Sir Henry,
every movement of mine
would have been watched
while in this way only you and
Sir Henry have been watched
and I have been free to work.
That's all very well,
making a fool of me.
Sit down, Watson, do sit down.
Perhaps a little supper will help
you get over your huff
Huff? I'm in no huff!
Here try some of these sardines.
It's a pity I didn't
know you were coming,
I would have provided a
brace of pheasants.
It's a pity you didn't think of
bringing down that infernal violin of yours.
to regale me with some
of your enchanting music.
I did my dear Watson.
Anything to oblige.
Well, if you've had
enough to eat Watson...
and are feeling of better spirits
I think we better be getting along.
Getting along where?
If I am not prying.
I'm returning with you
to Baskerville Hall.
There are still some gaps
to be filled in, but all in all...
things are becoming
a little clearer
Not to me I assure you.
Still a hopeless jumble.
Mr. Franklin, Dr. Mortimer,
the Barryman's...
Put it all together and
what have you got?
Murder, my dear Watson.
A refined cold blooded murder.
Murder?
There is no doubt
about it in my mind,
or perhaps I should say
in my imagination
that's the way crimes are conceived
and where they are solved,
in the imagination.
But there has been no murder
unless you mean, Sir Charles.
and the facts clearly indicated
that he died from heart failure.
That's why so many murders
remain unsolved, Watson.
People will stick to facts,
even if they prove nothing
Now, if we go beyond facts
use our imagination
as the criminal does,
imagine what might have happen
to him and act upon it
as I have been trying
to do in this case...
we usually find ourselves justified.
Then you know?
Another day or two at the
most and I will know.
My one fear is that the murderer
will strike before we are ready.
In that case...
What's that?
Where is it coming from?
There.
No, no there.
The hound!
Come on Watson, quick
Look.
Sir Henry.
Must have run along that
ridge and fallen over the cliff.
He's dead?
Skull crushed in.
- The convict, thank heavens.
- What?
That's the man I shot
at the night we arrived.
The man Barryman was signalling to.
Who is it?
The Notting Hill murderer.
He escaped from
prison last month.
Hiding on the moor ever since.
The Notting Hill murderer?
You mean he is
responsible for all this?
That remains to be seen.
But he is wearing
Sir Henry's clothes.
Yes, yes, that accounts for it.
Accounts for what?
For the hound. These clothes were the
cause of that poor devils death.
You mean that the hound
was after Sir Henry.
Yes, and mistook the convict for
him because the scent of the clothes
Do you remember that
missing boot, Watson?
Why do you suppose
the brown one?
The one that had
never been warn?
was so mysteriously replaced
and the black one taken?
Why?
Because a boot that had never been
worn wouldn't have the scent of the owner
and the black one had.
But how did this convict come
to be wearing Sir Henry clothes?
Oh, well that's simple enough.
Why Dr. Watson,
is somebody hurt?
Who is this?
The convict who
escaped from Princeton.
Oh, it's terrible!
I heard a cry that's what
brought me over here.
What's your theory
about it, Mr. Holmes?
Your quick at identification.
Everybody knows you, sir.
As a matter of fact we have
been expecting you down here.
My names Stapleton.
How do you do?
You came in time
to see a tragedy.
Yes, yes, a most unpleasant
remembrance for me to
take back to London tomorrow.
Oh, must you go so soon?
I have been looking
foreword to meeting you.
Yes, yes I am afraid I must.
We were hoping, Mr. Holmes,
you may be able to shed some light
on the occurrences that have
puzzled us down here.
Yes, but an investigator needs something
more than legends and rumours.
Quite so.
Give me a hand will you, Watson,
we better put this poor fellow in one
of these huts until the morning.
Let me give you a hand.
Oh, I think we can manage
all right thank you.
Where is Sir Henry, Barryman?
In the library, sir.
Now, Barryman, is
your wife still up?
Will you tell her Mr. Sherlock
Holmes would like a word with her?
Sherlock Holmes?
Yes
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sir Henry.
Holmes.
I am glad to see you so well,
Sir Henry.
Why didn't you tell me Mr.
Holmes was coming?
Well, I...
He didn't know, we across
each other in the village.
I am glad to see you.
What is Barryman?
I asked to see Mrs. Barryman,
if you don't mind, Sir Henry.
Of course not.
Come in, Ms. Barryman.
I think you better sit down.
Thank you, sir, I prefer to stand.
I am afraid I have some
rather bad news for you.
What is it?
Well it's going to
be a bit of a shock.
Oh, they've caught him?
Your,
Your brother.
They will hang him for sure!
No, Mrs. Barryman.
He is beyond the law now.
He is in more merciful hands.
We came upon the poor fellow
as we were crossing the moor.
He must have missed his footing
and fallen over the cliff.
No further need, Barryman
to signal to him from the window
or take food out to him or
give him Sir Henry's
discarded clothes.
Oh, Sir Henry,
it is all my doing.
Barryman here wanted
to tell you all along
so as you could notify the police.
but he was my kin, my own kin
even though he
was never any good.
We understand.
You won't hold it against
Barryman? Oh, yes, sir.
Of course not.
Now take her along and
see that she is all right.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Sir Henry.
Well, it's nice to get that end
cleared up for their sake as well as mine.
It clears up everything,
I think Sir Henry.
That poor devil must have
been completely demented.
And that accounts for
those dreadful noises
that we have been
hearing from time to time.
Exactly.
Your troubles are over, Sir Henry.
I really am most
grateful, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, not at all I've
done little enough.
But you can sleep peacefully
in your bed now
and commence to lead the
life of a happy country squire.
Well, not for a little
bit I am afraid.
I'm off to Canada again.
Canada?
Beryl, Miss. Stapleton and I
are going to be married.
Miss. Stapleton?
A very charming young lady,
Congratulations!
Everything is arranged.
Her brother is giving us
a farewell party tomorrow night.
We'll be married in London
the following day.
and then off to a
honeymoon in Canada.
My congratulations too, Sir Henry.
Thanks.
What luck you're here.
You and Dr. Watson will be
with us tomorrow night
No, I am sorry I afraid I can't
I must hurry back to London
and so should you too, Dr. Watson.
You'll have to report to the police
here about that convict in the morning
but there is a train living
early in the afternoon.
Oh, what a pity, Beryl will
be dreadfully disappointed.
Now will remedy that when
you come up to London.
You must...
You must dine with
us before you sail
Well, there's the old boy himself
Sir Hugo, Hugo the
Beast of the Baskervilles.
Not a bad bit of brushwork.
By Ransome, one of
the minor painters.
Oh, I don't imagine
it's very valuable.
I can't quite agree
with you, Sir Henry.
One day, it might prove to
be of the greatest value.
Well, we must be going.
There are still one or two
little points Holmes, that I can't
for the life of me reconcile
with your theory.
about that poor demented convict.
One or two little points?
Surely, you can't mean he was
in London three weeks ago?
sent that letter,
stole that boot?
Of course not.
Then who the devil did?
The same person who was responsible
for the death of that convict last night.
and will try again to murder,
Sir Henry tonight.
Tonight?
Unless my imagination
has run away with itself
and I don't think that it has.
Then why are we
rushing up to London?
Leaving, Sir Henry
entirely unprotected?
We're not my dear, Watson.
We're just giving the impression
of rushing up to London.
In a minute now we will be in
Okehampton,
there we'll catch a train
back to Dartmoor.
and if my surmise is correct
we will nab out man in the act.
If you know who it is
why all this running about rigmarole?
Why don't you have him arrested?
Because I have no case,
not a shred of evidence that
would hold in any court.
The only way is to catch him red-handed.
To catch him in such a
way there is no escape,
no alibi.
That means gambling
with Sir Henry's life.
But you can't possibly...
Gambling to save his life!
But we got to take that chance.
Otherwise, the shadow of sudden death
will be forever hanging over
his head, and sooner or later...
Here we are Okehampton.
And may you both spend the
rest of your years together,
- in happy content.
- hear, hear
Thank you, thank you.
And now I want to thank you all for
the kindness that you have shown a stranger
and when Beryl and I return,
I want you to know that
you'll always be welcome
at Baskerville Hall.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Sir Henry
It's going to be lonely for you
Mr. Stapleton with Beryl gone.
Yes, indeed it will, Mrs. Mortimer
I should be more dependant
than ever upon you,
my neighbours.
Don't count upon me, sir.
In my opinion you're
a body snatcher.
And until the courts
have decreed otherwise.
I want nothing what so
ever to do with you.
Oh, Mr. Franklin!
I say driver, can't
you go a little faster?
I'm doing the best I can, sir.
You idiot! We said go faster,
not break our necks!
How far is it to
Baskerville Hall?
It's 5 miles by road, sir.
But if you want to cut over the moor
it's only about three.
Here you are.
Come on, Watson, quick!
It's been a wonderful
evening, Stapleton.
Well, glad you could
be with us, Mortimer.
Take this broach my dear and
wear it on your wedding dress.
It belonged to my
great-grandmother.
Something old, something
new, you know.
Oh, that's so sweet of you
Mrs. Mortimer! Thank you, so much.
And come back to us soon,
both of you.
We will.
May I offer you a lift, me lad.
It's such a beautiful night, Mr. Franklin,
I think I'll walk, thank you.
Merely, a gesture of hospitality,
reject it, if you like.
You're not going to cross
the moor alone, Sir Henry.
Why not? There's
nothing to fear anymore.
We can't be sure.
Oh, but I have Sherlock Holmes
own word for it.
Come along, James.
Good night, Sir Henry.
Good night, Mrs. Mortimer.
And the best of luck to you both.
Thank you, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I wish you would let Mr. Franklin
drive you home.
I wanted to stay and
say good night to you.
This is our last good night.
From tomorrow on there
won't be anymore, ever.
Tomorrow we will be
away from this place.
I wish it were now.
So do I.
Oh, now don't be silly
Good night, Beryl.
Good night, dear.
Well was it a nice party?
Wonderful, everything
and most of all you.
Jack, I haven't said very much
about going away but...
You know how I feel.
Yes, of course, it had to be.
You won't be too dreadfully
lonely will you?
Well I should have my work.
Henry and I will be back before
you even know it.
Yes, of course you will.
Well, you better go to bed now.
You got a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.
Good night, Jack.
Good night, dear.
Over there.
We'll head him off.
Jack.
Where are you?
He's coming too.
You'll be all right old man.
Watson?
Yes, ole chap.
Mr. Holmes?
Yes.
What, what was it?
We've got to get
him home, quickly.
Can you manage him alone?
- Yes.
- Cause I got things to do.
Help, get his arm
around my shoulder.
I'm all right.
It's pretty painful, I know.
But it won't take much longer.
Go on, it doesn't hurt.
Now, Mrs. Barryman
some gauze, please.
I just heard the dreadful news.
Thank heavens, you're safe.
Is he all right?
Well, now we know for
certain this is no legend.
No myth, there really is a hound.
Was a hound?
Yes, Mr. Holmes told me.
I ran into him across the moor.
He asked me to send
you to him at once.
It's a matter of great importance.
He said he would wait for you
at the spot where the beast was killed.
I must finish here first.
This poor boy has
taken a terrific beating.
Well, I could carry
on for you, Doctor
I'm a bit of a doctor
myself, you know.
Do you think you could manage?
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I think you really
ought to go, Dr. Watson
Mr. Holmes was most urgent.
Oh, really?
I should need some hot water,
Mrs. Barryman.
Oh, I want it boiling, please.
Yes, sir.
Must have been a terrifying
experience, Sir Henry.
Terrifying.
It was.
It was indeed.
Yes, I can see you are still
weak from loss of blood.
I can't say I feel any too well.
Here drink this, Sir Henry.
You will feel much stronger.
I'll see to your
other bandages after.
Oh, it may taste a little
bitter but don't mind that.
Sir Henry...
Well, feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
I say that's uncomfortably
close to your eye isn't it?
All along this side...
well, well.
Oh, I am terribly sorry,
that was clumsy of me.
It was only a bit of a tonic.
Sir Henry, has lost
considerable blood.
- Yes.
- Henry
Henry!
I'm all right, darling.
Oh no, you're not.
We hear those dreadful
noises on the way home.
It's a mercy he's alive.
I owe you an apology, Sir Henry,
for jeopardizing your life.
Jeopardizing?
But you saved my life.
But there was no possible way
for me to fore tell the plot.
And I must also apologize to
for deceiving you last night
when I told you that your
troubles were over
I knew that they weren't.
But if I hadn't cleared out,
the crisis which came tonight
would have indefinitely been postponed.
with the shadow of
death hanging over you...
and over you too
Miss. Stapleton.
You knew this was
going to happen?
How could you know?
The person who wanted to
snuff out your life, Sir Henry,
was the same one who
plotted to kill your Uncle.
He wanted to get you
both out of the way.
So, he could lay claim to this place,
to the whole Baskerville estate.
In tracing back his lineage.
He discovered not only that
he was the next of kin.
But also learned of that old
legend about the hound.
So he brought the hound to life.
By the simple expedient of buying
the most savage dog that he could find
and hiding it on the
moor until he needed it.
If he had succeeded tonight
the blame would have fallen on
the legendary monster.
and no possible suspicion would
have been attached to him.
A most ingenious device.
And I am quite sure that he would
have had no difficulty
in proving his claim to Baskerville
Hall and all that goes with it.
The most amazing instance of a
throw back that I have ever seen.
And you can see for yourself.
Stapleton.
One move and I'll shoot!
Jack.
You two, stay where you are.
You're under arrest Stapleton,
for the murder of Sir Charles Baskerville,
the murder of a convict and the
attempted murder of Sir Henry.
You can't arrest me, Holmes.
Now one move from any of you and
I will blast you all to kingdom come.
So, sorry old boy.
What's the matter, old man?
What's the matter?
That's our man.
Stapleton, a murderer.
He won't get very far.
I've posted Constable's
on both the roads
and the only other way,
is across the Grimpen mire.
I'm so sorry, Miss Stapleton.
I wish I could have
spared you this.
Well, that officially closes
the case, Sir Henry.
And a very interesting case for
your annals Watson.
An ordinary dog and a
genius criminal.
And a more ingenious detective.
I owe you a tremendous
debt of gratitude.
Oh, we all do, Sir Henry!
Mr. Holmes, we have
admired you in the past
as does every Englishman.
Your record as our greatest detective
is known throughout the world.
But this, seeing how you work
knowing that there is in
England such a man as you.
Gives us all a sense of
safety and security.
God bless you, Mr. Holmes!
Thank you, Dr. Mortimer,
thank you.
Now, if you don't mind, I have
had a rather strenuous day
I think I'll turn in.
Of course.
Good night, good night.
Good night, Mr. Holmes.
Good evening, sir.
Oh, Watson. The needle.
