THE RED SQUIRREL
Shit!
Jump!
Jump!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
Breathe slowly,
or you'll choke.
Slowly, do as I tell you.
Slowly and deeply.
Like this, look.
Breathe along with me.
That's it.
That's it.
That's much better.
You were like
a fish out of water.
I'd better not
take off your helmet.
They say that you shouldn't.
It looks like
someone threw you off.
Look, you see?
We're calling an ambulance.
It won't take long.
You're all right,
you've just had a shock.
Does anything hurt?
Your head?
What's your name?
What?
Look into my eyes.
Tell me your name.
I don't know.
I can't remember it.
Hey, you're a girl!
You remember that, right?
A girl?
Will we look
for some identification?
Come on!
- I'm sleepy.
- That's normal.
You got quite a knock.
What?
You're lying down.
You fell.
You've got no ID papers.
Well, I can't find any.
You know what ID papers are?
- A driving licence and that.
- Yes.
Would they be...
...on the bike?
What's wrong with me?
- I can't remember anything.
- Don't worry.
Come on, think.
Who are you?
Don't try to force it.
No, just think.
I can't. I don't know.
Say a name.
- A name.
- The first one you think of.
A name!
I can't think of any names!
Where are you from?
Name a place.
Nothing.
Not a thing.
What's that noise?
- An ambulance.
- Good.
Remember I told you
we'd called one?
Yes.
So you've remembered something.
That's very good.
Yes, I think I'm better.
Ask more questions.
What are your eyes like?
My eyes?
- What are my eyes like?
- Yes, what color are they?
This is stupid.
I just can't remember.
What's wrong with them?
Nothing at all.
Your eyes are fine.
What are they like?
Blue.
Blue eyes that get tangled.
And who are you?
What's wrong?
She says she can't
remember anything.
- Hello.
- Hello.
How come you're on the sand?
I don't understand.
She fell with the bike
from up there.
That's something!
Were you going flat out?
Hey, lean on me!
Go on, don't worry.
It's all muscle, really!
- Who was driving?
- She was.
You're lucky
you fell on the sand.
A bit further on,...
...and you'd have landed
on the rocks.
I didn't fall on the sand.
I was able to jump off
before we hit the railing.
What's your name?
Jay.
That noise is the ambulance.
Very good.
The siren.
Remember...
...anything else?
I'm dying of sleep.
Go to sleep.
That's nice!
My eyes are tangled with sleep.
- Just a minute.
- No, I'm all right.
Then come with me,...
...so we can get
all your friend's data.
No, I'm not in bed,
I'm not even at home.
I'm working now.
I'm on night shift
in a hospital.
Doing what? You're a lovely
cleaning lady,...
...cleaning empty offices,
or a midwife...
...who can talk while she works.
No, right now,...
...all the lights are out,...
...and I'm in darkness,...
...sad and neglected.
All I want to do is dedicate...
..."Let there be love",...
...by Nat King Cole,...
...to someone...
...not in the hospital.
The gas man who serves me...
....every day.
Well, that will be done...
...right away, but first,
tell me your name.
No, not until I find out...
...my gas man's name.
- Luis Alfonso.
- That's very easy.
For that, and for other things,...
...your gas man can call us...
...on 28 1111
on the program, "Life or Death".
That's3,000 even.
I'm going to give him
a clue to who I am.
Wait!Wait!
Let me hear the clue!
My radio batteries are dead.
We're dying to hear the clue.
I'm the blond man,...
...with the yellow car.
Congratulations.
Sorry. You listen
to nighttime radio?
Cause of admittance?
Motorbike accident.
But it's the girl who came...
Don't worry.
Girl's name?
What?
Her name?
Elisa...
...Matximbarrena.
- Second name?
- Fuentes?
Fuentes.
That's my name.
Yeah?
My first surname.
Address?
Mine. I mean, we live together.
That's great.
Number 2, Paseo del Kursaal.
Here, in Donosti.
Have you her medical card?
Bring it tomorrow.
All right.
Your name?
Alberto .
And her profession?
Unemployed. She's unemployed now.
- And you?
- I'm a musician.
Really?
-4 years ago, I'd a group...
...with four girls.
What was your name?
The Flies.
The Flies!
Then you're Jay!
You were great!
I'm sorry you gave up.
What happened to you?
The doctors need you.
My arm!
My arm!
My arm!
- My arm's gone!
- Anyone know what happened?
Some bastard ran her down
and cleared off.
How is she?
Fine, just a bit stunned.
Hello!
I remember the ambulance,
everything.
The light, perfectly.
What's her name?
Lisa.
Lisa.
And why are you here?
Look closely at him.
Try to remember.
Don't worry if she doesn't
recognize you.
She's had an upset
and doesn't even know...
...her own name.
You spoke to me on the beach.
I'm Jay.
Remember anything else?
What did you say my name was?
- Lisa.
- No, it isn't.
It comes from Elisa.
But I've always called you Lisa.
When can I take her home?
We'll keep her in Neurology
for a few days,...
...but she'll probably
remember everything tomorrow.
I'll be back tomorrow.
They say I've got dark eyes.
Blue eyes, that get tangled!
And along cat's tongue,
you slut.
That's from a song.
There is a place
where the squirrels rule.
And that's the leafy
and mysterious wood.
The red squirrel
comes from Central Europe,...
...and normally lives
in coniferous woods.
However, it can also adapt
to deciduous woods,...
...with trees such as the oak,
chestnut, walnut, hazel, etc.
In these woods,...
...the red squirrel feeds mainly
on nuts such as the hazel.
With practice, it can break
the shell in two at one go.
Its rear claws are stronger
and longer than its front ones.
So squirrels always come down
trees head first,...
...bearing their weight...
...on the sharp claws
of their rear paws.
Their lightness allows them
to reach the flowers...
...on the topmost branches,...
...using their tail
in order to keep their balance.
In the mating season,
spring and summer,...
...the males begin to defend
their territory from other males.
One male defeats another...
...by means of
aggressive pursuit.
The dominant male,
normally the more masculine,...
...expels the intruder.
There is usually a skirmish,...
...where the worst
that happens...
...is the loss
of the tip of a tail.
Eli, breathe with me.
They are also cunning,
humble and light,...
...like flies,...
...liars,...
...shy but strategic,...
...sinuous,...
...and very capable
of weaving clever plots...
...behind men's backs.
I'm Lisa, your amnesiac
friend. Remember?
The red squirrel,...
...capable of jumping
-12 feet from tree to tree,...
...is the only ruler
in the mysterious wood.
Elisa Matximbarrena's room,
please.
The specialist wants to see you.
Follow me.
- The relative of 112 is here.
- Send him in.
Come in.
Sit down, please.
Are you Elisa Matximbarrena's
husband?
We're not married.
We're against...
- ...marriage.
- So am I.
- But we've lived together...
- Yes, well...
The neurological exploration
and the scan were normal.
But she remembers nothing
before the accident.
She has retrograde amnesia
produced by a blow to the head.
How long could that last?
In general, it's very difficult
to know how long it may take.
Days, months...
- Has she other family?
- Just her parents.
But they're touring the U.S.
by bus,...
...until the end of August.
In that case,...
...only you can help her.
You must stimulate her memory
bit by bit.
Remind her of pleasant things
and don't mention...
...the accident.
She'll stay here a few days.
A psychiatrist will treat her
with induction or hypnosis.
That often works well.
Did you bring her ID?
I forgot it.
I need it urgently
for the report.
Sure.
You're Jay.
- Are you my boyfriend?
- Yes.
That's what I thought,
from the kiss the other day.
That was last night.
I dreamt about you.
What did you dream?
I'm not telling you.
You have to do
memory exercises.
Do we live together?
Yes.
Since when?
It's four years now.
A long time.
Well...
- Where?
- In an apartment by the beach.
That's nice!
We were meant
to go on vacation today.
Yeah, to a campsite,
beside a lake.
Know what a lake is?
Of course.
Well, imagine the two of us,...
....lying in the sand by a lake.
We've been imagining it
for 3 months.
What do you work at?
I mustn't tell you anything.
You've to rediscover me
bit by bit.
What about me?
- Am I good at anything?
- Yes.
What?
Shoes.
- Shoes?
- Yeah, you work in a shoe shop.
You're kidding.
You did, now you're unemployed.
Why?
The shoe shop closed down
a few months ago.
Just as well!
What a shock!
Do I love you a lot?
Yes.
How do you know?
Everyone does.
You're crazy about me.
What about you?
I'm the same.
Then kiss me.
Like the other day.
Here.
Going with Eli?
Eli took her car,
she's left me.
I put the stove and some pots
in along with the tent.
That's great.
I knew about Eli already.
Yeah, I reckoned
she'd told you all.
Anyway...
Jay, she's a psychiatrist!
He's her boyfriend.
Hello.
You brought me something?
Come here.
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.
- I have to name them.
- Come on, next photo.
Felix.
Go on.
Ana.
Julio.
It's a woman.
Julia, then.Jay.
Who's Jay?
He is.
Don't stop.
Felix.
Who's Felix?
Just answer!
Come on!
You've said Felix twice.
In this and in number thirteen.
And they're similar.
It's the same person.
- What does Jay stand for?
- Alberto.
Did I say Alberto?
Still, I said lots of J's.
Julian, Julio, Jaime...
We'll carry on with this
tomorrow.
Would you come with me?
Just for a moment.
I'm very interested
in amnesia,...
...and cases like Lisa's
are rare.
Would you tell me
all you know about her?
- Sure, whenever you want.
- What about now?
- My office is upstairs.
- I'll be up now.
- I want to speak to Lisa.
- I'll wait in my office.
It's all sorted out.
Get dressed right now.
- We're going on vacation.
- Really?
- What a great bike, Jay!
- It's yours.
You've prepared everything.
It's marvellous.
I'll look after the helmets,...
...and you can drive.
No, you drive.
I'm going to navigate.
I've got a map.
Jay, I don't want to drive.
That's a pity.
- Why?
- I can't drive a motor bike.
Neither can l, I've forgotten.
Don't tell lies.
So how did you manage
to get the bike here?
Come on, I'll hold you.
At least tell me
how to start it.
I think it's like this.
Now a great song by a group...
...which disappeared 4 years ago,
"Elisa", by The Flies.
Elisa,
dream,
Bird of blue iron and of salt.
Mystery!
I dream that I live,
I dream that I live within you,
and I live
surrounded by iron,
treading on salt.
The Golden Tree Campsite.
Here's another one.
The Corn Bunting Campsite.
Tell me a quality you have.
The See You In Summer Campsite.
Maybe.
You can't ride a motorbike.
What can you do?
They're all beside the lake.
It's really a reservoir.
I know you're very something.
Very fast.
I've got amazing reflexes.
Show me.
The Alepo Pine Campsite.
I intend to test you.
The Red Squirrel.
That one!
It's got a beach too.
The Red Squirrel Campsite.
Mediterranean atmosphere.
Sounds good.
It's settled then.
Let's go.
Jay!
How did you do that?
You had time to do everything.
It was easy.
I had to throw my helmet
in the air...
...so as to catch yours,...
...put it on...
...have my hands
free again,...
...and catch your helmet
before it fell.
- This helmet smells of you.
- I'll put on yours.
THE RED SQUIRREL
I'm sure I know you.
I doubt it.
THE FLIES
You have to sign.
Both of you.
I'll go with you.
All right.
This is it.
Enjoy yourselves.
Thanks.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
What a pity!
We can't see the water!
It's right there.
Just behind those pine trees.
We have the best beach.
Thanks.
Jay,...
...you made a good choice.
Dad, can we help?
Go ahead.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You going to help?
- Yeah.
Pass me the rods.
Here they are.
Ana, take the small ones.
Hello there!
Have you come far?
No, from San Sebastian.
We're from Vitoria.
Well, I'm not, my husband is.
Hello.
We come here...
...every year.
I'm Carmen.
I'm Lisa.
And that's Jay, my boyfriend.
- How are you?
- Hello.
Your children are real capable.
- The little one isn't mine.
- Isn't she?
Poor little thing.
Ana's my daughter.
They spend the whole day
being mother and daughter.
Look, do it like me.
Very good.
Dad, count one, two, three.
Now!
One...
Two...
Three!
Why don't you have dinner
with us tonight?
We're right there.
- Yeah, great.
- Right.
Thanks.
Don't tell them
you've got amnesia.
I won't say a word.
And don't get too friendly.
We won't be inviting them back.
Why not?
We came here to relax
so you can get your memory back.
Anyway, you don't like families.
You disapprove of kids,...
...and I can't stand
that taxi driver.
Come on, sit down.
Christ!
What reflexes!
Yes, he's got amazing reflexes.
I'm jealous!
- Yeah, he's very fast generally.
- Really?
I was the 100 meters
area champion.
Jesus!What a coincidence!
Our son, Alberto,...
...is a runner.
He's in Vitoria.
Is he running?
No, he has to study
during the week.
- He failed five subjects.
- Six.
Well...
Music doesn't count.
Alberto's my husband.
He can hypnotize people.
- How old is he?
- Thirteen.
You'll meet him tomorrow.
He's coming for the weekend.
And are you sporty too?
Yes.
I'm a swimming champion.
We must see you in action!
Yes.
You can give us a demonstration!
You're a pair of champions.
That's how we met,
winning at trials.
If I hadn't had
to start work...
...so young, I'd have been
a great rally driver.
Carmen could tell you.
We've often been close to death,
but as he's a good driver...
You're still here.
Right.
- You're lucky!
- Good evening.
Enjoy your meal.
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.
Hey, Carmen...
Begoña,...
...you're getting better.
Aren't I?
Do you mind if the little one
sleeps with you in the caravan?
If it's a problem,
just tell me, really.
No, she can sleep with Cristina.
It's too much!
And she always eats with you.
I must give you a present.
She's a darling.
Prawns?
- You're eating prawns?
- Yes. You want some?
- No, but let me pay for her.
- Absolutely not.
- I insist, she's my daughter.
- Don't be silly.
But Ana didn't eat any.
She didn't? Why not?
She doesn't like prawns.
Look, keep the money,
please, Begoña.
No, not at all!
Have some prawns then.
Well...
Begoña's been a widow
for two years.
Now she chases after Germans.
Her husband, the poor man,...
...died in the car,...
...because on a journey....
...he fell asleep.
But the thing is,
he was German,...
...and she wants another one,...
...because, apart from that,...
...it seems that they...
...can do their stuff.
Well, I'm going to bed.
I have to get up early
and go pick up Alberto,...
...and I want to be in form.
I want to do Vitoria
in under fifty minutes.
Guess what...
...average speed that is?
Just guess!
I don't know.
One hundred and seventy!
Average!
I'm going to try.
Lisa, I'll show you
my photo album.
I'm going to get some sleep.
Good night, mermaid.
So long, champ.
That's my house.
And that idiot is me,
in the patio.
It was my neighbor
who took the photo.
That's Alberto,...
...my athlete,...
...the one I love most of all.
Look! Our wedding day.
Mine wasn't like that.
But...
...didn't you say
Jay was your boyfriend?
Yes,...
...but we're so recently
married, I forget.
Gran dad's taxi's going to come
with Dad in it.
- And who's Grandad?
- The taxi driver.
You're my daughter, Ana,
I'm your mother, Cristina.
Alberto, who's in Vitoria,...
...is your father Alberto.
The taxi driver's your Grandad.
He's the father
of your mother and father.
Understand?
- Dad's a taxi driver?
- No!
When will he come?
Right now!
I'm his wife waiting for him
and you're his daughter.
And we wait for him together,
do you see?
Do you see or not?
Yes, but he's not coming.
I told Carmen we were married.
I heard you.
Well?
Are we married?
We're against matrimony.
And before?
Was I ever married?
It's very hot in here.
- What do you work at?
- Nothing.
- So what do you live off?
- You.
I'm a house person.
But I'm unemployed!
Yes, well,...
...we're in a bad patch now,...
...but you'll find something.
What a nerve, you're useless.
You're lying. I bet
you're good at something.
Jay,...
...you and I...
Are we good people?
They're coming!
Look!
Average speed...
Christ, that's scary!
There are no tricks.
This doesn't lie.
Hi, husband!
Next time I'll thump you!
Hi, Dad!
Alberto's staying here
all week.
How fast does the bike go?
Ask her. It's her bike.
Yeah, the bike's mine.
But the one who can really
drive it,...
...the real star, is him.
On a bike, he's number one.
Is that true?
No, she's just showing off.
Don't ever trust...
...that girl.
- I hear you were a sprinter.
- Yes.
- Would you race me?
- No, I wouldn't.
- And you, can you swim?
- Yes.
- I'll race you at swimming.
- Sure.
Ready!
Go!
Come on, Alberto. come on!
Be careful, Anton!
Careful!
Where's Lisa?
Do you see her?
You pushed her under!
Shit, what a girl!
Look! It's Mom!
I'll introduce you
to my daughter.
No, Anton, really!
You don't mind keeping her
do you?
- No, give her to me.
- If it's any bother, do tell me.
You see? She's really blond.
Ana!
We're off, and thanks so much.
You're real sweethearts.
Goodbye, my darling, goodbye.
Well, then?
What do you like me
to do to you?
I don't know,
I can't remember.
What do you like me
to do to you?
I like you to tousle my hair,...
...to caress me, and to suck me.
I like cooking for you.
I do it every day.
I've got amnesia.
My boyfriend's reminding me
of nice things.
Another bottle of wine?
Yes, please.
And you...
What do you like?
Me?
Swimming in the reservoir
at night.
The water is full of hands.
Careful.
You won't get away tonight.
Where are you going?
I like you to strip off
very slowly,...
...and then strip me
while you talk dirty.
- You say some incredible things.
- Really?
Like what?
Then I'd sing in your ear.
But what I like most of all
is cooking for you,...
...looking after you
all the time,...
...having you around.
That's wonderful!
Go on.
I like it when you get
on top of me,...
...and squeeze me real hard
between your legs,...
...and when you rub against me.
I love your fingers
in my mouth.
Don't move!
A plane's coming. I want
to get it passing overhead.
Eli, I'm crazy about you!
You and I have to go on a trip!
What would you like me
to do to you?
I like...
...when you grope me
from behind,...
...as far as you can,
and forwards,...
...and then lift me
off the ground.
Then squeeze my nipples
with your fingers,...
...or better still,
with your teeth.
I like you to strip me
real slowly,...
...then I climb
on top of you,...
...and squeeze you real hard
between my legs.
So that you can't get away.
How can you remember that?
I don't remember,...
...but I feel it here,...
...in my throat.
What would make you
scream with pleasure?
What drives me crazy
is when you bite me,...
...not very hard,...
...but not gently.
You have to bite me all over.
You have to bite me all over.
...for the dedication recently
from my gas man, Luis Alfonso.
I was particularly touched
that he called me...
...his client.
But tonight I want
to reveal my name.
I'm called...
Salvador.
...Salvador.
Did you enjoy that?
These tracks are from a rat,
a big one, too.
This campsite must be
full of rats.
They're a squirrel's.
There are no squirrels
left here.
Look at the pines.
This is reforestation.
It's all a lie.
Here, my Mom sent them over.
We'll give it a chance.
Now we've to let it act,
without watching.
It'll come down the tree
real quick.
Eli, do you know the world
we live in?
I'm not sure,...
...but you called me Eli.
Eli or Lisa,
they mean the same.
E-li-sa.
One step forward.
Slowly.
Two more steps to your right.
Stop there. Stop!
Ask her anything.
She'll answer without...
- ...realizing.
- What happened her?
Don't you see?
She's hypnotized.
That's interesting! Have you
tried with older people?
No, but I could do it with Mom,
she's weak.
One day I'll hypnotize her,...
...so she can clean
and not get tired.
Could you do it to Lisa?
Well, if she's willing...
You could sleep...
...up there.
Can I ask her something?
Sure, go right ahead.
Cristina, what can you see
right now?
A squirrel...
...eating a shrimp.
Lunch is ready!
Jay, Lisa, you too, eh?
I've loads of paella.
- No, thanks, Carmen!
- We'll be right over!
Right!
Cristina, give me a hand.
- Bring out the glasses.
- Okay.
Come on, champion.
Do it for me.
To be a woman, ride a motorbike
and do it well.Jesus!
It's doubly remarkable!
- Or triply!
- Thank you.
You never say that to me, Jay.
You're an exception. I don't
know any woman who drives well.
And I speak as a professional.
You haven't the reflexes
or the aggression.
And, it's stupid,
but you haven't got balls.
And it shows, doesn't it?
I haven't got balls either.
That's why I don't drive
and can't recognize your merits.
You never let me get a licence.
What the hell for?
We only have one car
and that's for work.
- I could help you.
- I don't need your help!
So can you ride the motorbike
or not?
She can answer you.
Let's see what she makes up.
Jay is useless,
he can't do a single thing,...
...except fuck, cook and lie.
Where's Jay?
On the motorbike.
I knew it.
If you knew
how you've turned me on...
From now on,
you do what I tell you.
All right.
You and I came here
to be alone.
We don't need this family.
All right.
Brutal accident
in San Sebastian.
Motorist knocks down couple
in hit-and-run.
But Alberto...
...doesn't begin with J.
It's a bit odd, isn't it?
Why is he called Jay?
It's a nickname from work.
Where does he work?
- Who, Jay?
- Yes.
He's a mechanic. If you saw
how he fixed the bike.
- Fast, is he?
- Yeah, at everything.
- And what do you work at?
- Me? Shoes.
- You sell shoes?
- Yes.
- I did, I'm unemployed now.
- Oh, no!
- So I can study.
- What are you studying?
Animals. I'm crazy
about zoology.
I do envy you.
Yeah, I guess so.
My life is so boring.
Anton is in the taxi all day,
and I clean three houses.
With my own, four.
Come and stay in my house
for awhile.
- In your house?
- Yes.
I'd love to!
It's full of animals.
What do you have?
Everything, especially birds.
- Who looks after them?
- Just now, my brother.
Where do you live?
Right at the beach.
Oh, I'm so envious!
Come on, then. You can
forget about your husband.
It would be great to get away
from the house for awhile.
Look.
Hello!
I came along with Carmen.
- She works so hard.
- Hello, Jay.
Give her our address
so she can...
...visit us.
Have you got any paper?
I'll write on the paté.
-14, Euskalherria St.,
-4th Floor.
If you buy
such a small table,...
...we can't invite anyone.
I'll lend you mine,
it can seat twelve.
We're right beside you
and it's easy to move.
Right, and one day you can come
and eat at our tent!
Terrific!
How was it?
It was excellent,
you cook very well.
I know that.
- It's tasteless.
- It's the same as always.
It's always tasteless.
And why can't you tell me
where I was born? Just that.
Why does it matter?
I could situate myself a bit!
You won't tell me the names
of my parents,...
...or if I have
brothers or sisters.
You must exercise your memory,
and there's no rush here.
The advantage of camping.
One day you'll say,...
...I was born in San Sebastian.
Yeah? In San Sebastain?
Madrid, Lisbon, Frankfurt,
Gijon,...
...Zaragoza,...
...and Donosti.
It was in one of those.
I'd prefer Lisbon.
I hope it was Lisbon!
Are you going to leave
the bike stuck up like that?
No, we're going to drive round
the reservoir.We have to talk.
Yeah, but you drive.
Fucking hell!
She's got some lungs!
You can't take much!
I got bored down there.
Take it easy,
breathe in time with me.
Breathe slowly.
You're like a fish
out of water.
What do you know?
About what?
You know more than you say.
What do I know?
I have the feeling...
...you're lying to me.
I think you've begun
to remember...
...but you won't say so.
Why?
What for?
I don't know.
But you like playing with me.
Really, you're playing
with everyone.
Don't say that.
I remember absolutely nothing
and I don't even care.
Do you love me?
When I finish
counting to three,...
...and I say "Three",...
...you'll be completely
hypnotized.
Are you scared?
No, I like it.
Then, when you hear
"One and three",...
...with a hand clap,
you'll waken up,...
...and you'll remember nothing.
All right, don't you worry.
Stare straight into my eyes.
One...
Two...
Three...
That's odd. Cristina always
stays awake.
Do I?
Ask her something,
to see what happens.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
Of course,
it's a hypnotic sleep!
What's your name?
Sofia.
That's wrong!
Please, leave me alone with her.
I want to ask
some personal questions.
But can you waken her?
Stay close by
and I'll call you.
She's not here.
I know nothing about her.
I'm Jay. Do you know me?
Yes.
What's your name?
Sofia.
What else?
Tell me your surname.
Fuentes.
Do you live alone?
Are you married?
Shit.
Is your husband called Felix?
What's wrong?
Are you afraid?
Where is...
...your husband?
He's looking for me.
You see? Nothing!
Nothing!
Not a sign of her
for over a week!
It's my sister's husband.
She was sleeping here.
These are her things.
But she isn't here.
Do you think I'm not worried?
I don't know what's up
between you two.
She said nothing.
You know how she is.
At times she just appears
and disappears.
The most likely thing is
that she took off,...
...when she heard you were here.
She didn't even take...
...her stuff!
Don't worry, Salvador.
Take it easy.
I gave you gas the other night.
You have a red Ford Capri.
I'm not to worry?
But it's very odd.
None of us knows where she is.
What happened to you two?
I'll tell you.
There isn't any mystery.
Hey, come here!
She won't answer or waken up!
One and three!
Give her a kiss,
that might work.
Do you remember anything?
What happened me?
I'm burning.
I love her from my entrails.
I need her like I need
my liver, my brain, my eyes.
Without her,
my bones shatter,...
...my lungs melt
and I can't breathe.
I need Sofia to live.
I'm going to stay
with you, Salvador.
I'll wait here
until you hear something.
Why did she leave you?
Did she explain why?
Sofia isn't well,...
...and she needs me.
I'm her angel.
Jota,...
...I love you from my entrails.
And you?
Did you hurt yourself?
Remember anything?
- No, I'm still the same.
- Good.
Why?
I like you more
as an amnesiac.
Oh, yes?
You've got areal nerve!
Hey!
Did you hurt yourself?
Want hypnotized?
Want to touch my ass?
You'd like to feel me.
I know you want to.
You're itching,...
...aren't you?
Now it'll bite you.
I left the radio on!
- Alberto, go on.
- Give me a break!
Cristina...
Ana can go,
she's our daughter.
Absolutely not!
Absolutely not!
Do you like lots of lettuce,
lots of tomato, or what?
With a bit of everything.
- Like that?
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- You speak German?
- No.
You prefer it like that
or with more tomato?
Just with tomato, if I may.
No problem.
Give me some with just tomato.
It's for Blondie.
Where did you learn German?
In Germany, but I was
born in Lisbon.
- Jay, I can speak German.
- Yeah.
Now we move on
to our Help Line.
We are searching for
Sofia Fuentes,25,...
...blond, 5 foot6,
-119 pounds,...
...who is mentally deranged,...
...and is travelling on
a motorbike, registration SS,...
...7766 AC.
That's the number
of Lisa's bike.
We repeat. We are
searching for Sofia Fuentes,...
...25, blond, 5 foot6,
-119 pounds,...
...and who is
mentally deranged,...
...and is travelling...
...on a motorbike...
...registration SS 7766 AC.
Anyone with information
please telephone...
...the San Sebastian number,
-288323.
I'm not deranged.
I'm not mad,...
...just amnesiac!
All I have is amnesia.
We had an accident recently
and I lost my memory.
But that doesn't
make me crazy, does it?
Why are they after you?
Because this is August 22nd.
Lisa got married very young...
...to a guy who soon
went crazy.
They tried all kinds
of induction techniques,...
...even hypnosis,
but it was useless.
Lisa left him
and he chased after her...
...for ages.
We met up and started
living together.
Since then,
for four years now,...
...every August 22nd,
their wedding anniversary,...
...he puts that message
on the radio.
I'm your amnesiac
girlfriend, remember?
What happened?
A pine cone fell on your head.
It's happened before
in this campsite.
Let's see.
What's your name?
Jay.
Very good!
What color are your eyes?
Blue.
He's all right.
Come down to the bar.
I'll give you a glass of brandy
and you'll be fine.
Don't touch it.
I'll put on some music.
Don't worry,
it could happen to anyone.
Elisa, I dream,
bird of blue steel and salt,
I just don't understand
why they say I'm deranged.
Do you?
Don't you worry.
It's obvious your husband
wants to hurt you.
What he wants...
...is for people like us
to mistrust you.
But we'll support you.
We're on your side.
But why put it on the radio?
- What for?
- To fuck you up.
But what does he want?
That guy's a bastard,
and he's in for it!
Look.
I've got the number here.
I'm going to phone him
and tell him...
...either he withdraws the spot
or I smash his face in!
You'll see!
You'll see...
...how he soon stops.
- That guy's an asshole!
- Who?
Don't call that number.
It's dangerous!
- Why?
- Don't get involved in this.
It's got nothing
to do with you.
I'm not scared.
You have a wife and two kids.
The less you know, the better.
It really bugs me!
Nobody makes me shut me up!
But Jay says it could be
dangerous for my family, so...
Thanks for offering to call
and being so brave.
But Jay's right,
he knows what he's saying.
Why did you stick your nose in?
- Do you remember anything?
- No.
- My husband's called Felix.
- Good, you're making progress.
I said that name twice
to the psychiatrist.
I still remember the awful
feeling those photos gave me.
You want us to go
somewhere else?
Why?
Are you afraid?
Hi, love. I'm finally here.
He's come to get me!
Sofia, I need you to breathe,
Without you, I've no air.
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him, please! Kill him!
- Jay's faster than you!
- Oh, yeah?
Yes, he's a champion sprinter.
Run! Let Felix see you run!
Ready...
One and three!
You're slime!
A liar!
You weren't on the bike!
You made it all up!
So what? I don't care!
That's true.
It doesn't matter.
It was she fooled you.
Don't you see she hasn't amnesia?
Hey, you're a girl!
You remember that, right?
What color are my eyes?
Come on, think.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
Name a place!
Sofia never had amnesia!
Where are your wonderful
reflexes?
Don't hit him any more, please!
Where are you?
Tell me...
...where you are!
I'll go pick you up!
- I'll never go back.
- Tell me where you are,...
...or I'll smash his face in!
Jay, even if he hits you,
I love you!
Lisa, tell him where you are,
please.
In The Red Squirrel.
I knew that already!
Sofia has a magnificent mind.
You'll see that one day,
asshole.
It's real hot in here.
We're looking for
Sofia Fuentes.
We repeat, Sofia Fuentes.
Don't drive too fast.
And you're to study, hear?
She is mentally deranged
and is travelling...
...on a motorbike,
registration SS 7766 AC.
Good-bye, daughter.
Good-bye.
Work hard!
You're not to play
that game again!
That's the third time today.
The guy's a pain.
You should turn off the radio.
Lisa's a bit upset.
I'm sorry, but as you said
he only did it on August22,...
...I thought today
would be safe.
Why do you call her Lisa
when the radio calls her Sofia?
Yes, why?
Elisa is the title
of my favorite song.
The group that played it...
...broke up just when we met,
so I changed your name.
Thank you.
Your head?
Fine.
The sight of blood
made you faint.
I'll spend the day in Vitoria
to see if I can earn a bit.
And I'll take him back
so he can study a bit.
He does nothing here.
Well...
See you tomorrow.
Good-bye!
Here.
Mom, you're so good.
I love you lots.
My little girl.
You're the good one.
Too good.
You're going to suffer a lot.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Yes?
- Is Felix there?
Yes, speaking.
It's about the spot
on the radio.
You've seen Sofia Fuentes?
Yes.
Where is she?
With me, we're together.
And who are you?
- I'm not telling you.
- All right.
Why are you calling me?
Why did you put on the spot?
Ask Sofia that.
I already did.
She doesn't want to see you.
And she's annoyed because
you say she's deranged.
- Annoyed?
- Why do you say she's deranged?
What's Sofia doing with you?
Who are you?
And you?
Are you her husband?
Where are you?
In Vitoria.
Another guy's just called
from Vitoria too.
- Because of the spot.
- What did he say?
I'm not telling you.
- But one of you is lying.
- Me.I'm lying.
Listen, Felix.
We know that fucking
taxi driver,...
...and as we knew he was going
to phone you, we've just left.
I'm phoning from a bar,
on the motorway.
That's why we called,
so that you'd know.
- Is Sofia there with you?
- Yes.
Get her on the phone.
Sofia, speak to him.
She doesn't want to.
Hold the telephone to her ear,
I'm not going to bite her.
Speak. She's listening to you.
- Mom's crying.
- Why?
- Otto's gone.
- Where to?
I don't know, for ever.
Poor Begoña.
Good morning, mermaid.
I'm going to fix a fantastic
breakfast.Just you wait.
Then we'll pack up and go.
Why?
Carmen!
You want to keep our table?
We can't take it on the bike.
I phoned home
and they're not there.
Don't worry, they'll have been
held up somewhere.
It's twelve,
they're always here by nine.
Christ, if any thing's happened
to them!
Come on!
Mom!
They're coming!
Oh, my God!
Thank heavens!
Alberto, my baby!
- Why make all this fuss?
- I was worried.
- I expected you at9.00.
- Ah, fuck it!
Fuck it?
She thought you'd been killed
on the road!
Are you telling me
how I should treat my wife?
I'm not.
Then just shut up!
Fuck!
I'll kill you!
Stop it!
Pig!
What the hell's going on here?
Hey, faggot!
If you can't control your girl
I soon will, all right?
All right.
We're late because
he went drinking last night.
He sent me to sleep at Patxi's.
Little fucker!
Lisa!
There's someone
by your clothesline.
Sofia, I remember your smell.
Since you left,...
...there's no air.
I'm drowning.
So I've come to get you.
Who are you?
Hello, I'm Felix,
Sofia's husband.
She hit her head in an accident,
and lost her memory.
And who believes that? You?
Sofia has amnesia?
And who are you?
My name's Jay.
Very brave!
And what else are you?
Come on!
He's Lisa's boyfriend.
So you're her boyfriend.
And she's got amnesia.
You're a conceited lizard,...
...a lying dwarf,
you're lower than a rapist.
I've been living with her
for six years.
A month ago she left me,...
...but we're still as one.
You're not her equal!
You can't even imagine
who you've been with.
Look at her!
She remembers me,
she knows everything.
You're so naive!
She lied to you!
She's too much for you!
Why don't you ask her
who she wants to go with?
I'm her angel.
Without her love, I don't exist.
My head is empty.
The blood doesn't flow
in my veins.
That's a lie!
You see?
I don't bleed.
Lisa, wait!
Lisa, wait!
Fucking hell!
You nearly ran me over,
you bastard!
Get out of my car!
Fucking madman!
You're a hell of a driver!
Why are you after her?
What's up between you two?
Don't you know?
Then you don't know.
You're the lunatic
who runs people over.
I was different before.
To love, you have to give.
I gave her my life,
all I've left is the car.
- What will you give?
- Where does she live?
She hasn't let you
get on the bike.
Give up, you've lost her.
Have you given up?
Lisa, come.
I have seen death very close.
My teeth were hurting.
The bed of the reservoir
smelt of earth.
I don't know where you are
or where you live.
Really, I know nothing
about you.
I don't know you.
But I hope that some day
you'll get in touch with me.
That's why I don't
go out of the house.
I've stayed in for a month.
A month without seeing you.
At least, call me.
Even if it's just that.
To hear your voice.
I'm dying to hear your voice.
Lisa, I've written
a song for you.
Lisa can call us
from 1.00 to 4.00 a.m.
The telephone is28 1111,
here at "Life or Death",...
...and we'll give her
the name of her lover,...
...who won't give his name.
We know it starts with J.
He requested a song for her
by the group The Flies,...
...and which is called
"Elisa".
Elisa,
dreams,
bird of blue steel
and salt.
Mystery!
Give me a sign, Lisa.
I'm sure I'll see it.
Come on, let's go.
Talk to my brother Salvador.
Who looks after them?
My brother.
Salvador!
I'm called Fuentes too.
- Yeah?
- My first surname.
- What's your surname?
- Fuentes.
Well, Jay!
Fancy seeing you here!
Hello,...
...Salvador.
How do you know my name?
I heard you say it
on the radio.
That's nice.
Now you listen
to the radio at night.
So...
Did you capture...
...your gas man?
I heard you too,
last night.
It was lovely.
I was moved.
You know her.
Why?
I brought her in here.
I made up her name.
Really?
Her real name
is Sofia Fuentes.
She has your surname.
She was Fuentes before,
but as a second surname.
You've a good memory.
She's your sister.
Yes.
She's told you something,
for sure.
For sure.
Where is she?
You're asking a lot,
after what you did.
Has she got her memory back?
I think she has.
Well, she hasn't.
Because Sofia
never had amnesia.
She fooled you from the start.
I knew it!
I knew it!
But I couldn't believe it.
On the beach,...
...after the accident,
she was dazed,...
...but in the ambulance
it all came back.
You know about Felix?
They found him in his car,...
...drowned in the reservoir.
The police were after him...
...for knocking down
four people.
I must see your sister
at once.
I wrote her a song.
Tell me where she is.
Please!
Do you love her?
What do you think?
Did she say she loved me?
She works in the Madrid zoo.
Lend me your car!
Lisa, you hadn't amnesia,
you lied from the start.
I'm not an idiot.
Our relationship
served no purpose.
We're two strangers.
I wrote you a song, but you...
You wasted your time with me.
Be quiet.
You still don't know what I am.
Shit!
Don't say anything.
