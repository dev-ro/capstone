Stay down.
Freeze! Just freeze.
Your hands ever shake, Frank?
Sometimes.
It's just adrenaline.
Of course.
How did you know?
-I saw him washing the car.
-So did I.
They don't wash cars
on the parking levels.
Frank...
...I'd like you to stay on.
I'm no good in a permanent position.
My feet go to sleep.
You're turning down $2,000 a week?
So you won't protect Rachel Marron
because she's in show business?
I don't do celebrities.
2500.
There's many good men for that much.
Have you talked to...
...Racine, Fitzgerald...
...Portman?
Portman's interested.
But we heard you were the best.
There's no such thing.
We're talking about a very frightened
lady with an 8-year-old son.
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't think this was real.
Farmer, she begged me to get you.
Please.
Okay, I'll come.
I'll look the situation over.
If I take it...
...it's 3000 a week.
You must be very deadly
for 3 grand a week.
Watch and see.
Shit.
It's something.
Sorry.
Don't stand there, either.
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.
What?
Alexander Graham Bell
to see Miss Marron.
Got an appointment?
The atomic number of zinc is thirty.
All right.
Can I help you?
You the man on the intercom?
Can I help you?
My name's Edison.
I have an appointment.
Arranged by...?
Mr. Devaney.
Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.
What happened?
A doll.
Henry Ford to see Mr. Devaney.
Who?
Henry Ford.
Come in.
Playback, everybody.
That's what I want.
Glad you came. Come on.
I'll introduce you to Rachel.
I bet you loved it.
-He doesn't know great art.
-Frank Farmer's here.
-Do you think this is me?
-It's terrific.
-Frank Farmer's here.
-Who?
Frank Farmer. The bodyguard.
I think Rory should be my bodyguard.
Raise your butt and come meet him.
All right. I'm up.
Frank Farmer...
...Rachel Marron.
You don't look like a bodyguard.
What'd you expect?
Maybe a tough guy.
This is my disguise.
His timing's good.
This is Nicki, Rachel's sister
and personal secretary.
Nice to meet you.
Tony Scibelli.
Sy Spector, publicist.
Can we get you a drink?
An orange juice.
Straight?
This is Bill's idea.
A sudden obsession with protecting me.
Tony's always done my security
and we've done just fine.
Is this what we talked about?
Bill's right. It's time
you took more precautions.
I'm sure they'll say the number of
nuts writing fan letters jumps...
...whenever Rachel's on a magazine.
Not like this.
Relax, guys.
I said I'll do it, so I will.
See what I'm dealing with?
I'll do this as long as
we understand each other.
I won't let this thing alter my life.
Honey, that won't be a problem.
Rachel's household is informal.
We're all on a first-name basis.
You'll fit in fine.
Choose whatever alarm system
you want for the house.
Improved security for the gate.
What else?
What else?
I think I'm safe when I'm at the house.
-So the main thing is when I go out.
-Exactly.
Tony will fill you in. I don't want you
falling all over me everywhere I go.
Fletcher cannot be affected.
I'll cover that. We'll tell him
you've got some other function.
I don't want him to think he's in prison.
So the estate must not be altered.
He shouldn't even know you're here.
There's been a misunderstanding.
So if you'll show me the way out,
I'll save us both trouble.
By the pool.
It was nice meeting you.
Or the entry door.
Shut up. Wait a minute!
We shouldn't beg this guy.
I'm handling this. Farmer,
would you wait a minute?
I should have told you more.
I was afraid she wouldn't do it.
I thought I'd let you two work it out.
We did.
She's not a bad person and whether
she knows it or not, she needs you.
You've come this far, wait a moment.
I must show you something.
Please, Farmer.
How are you today?
Fine. And you?
Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats?
No, I don't like boats.
Why not?
I don't know.
Sure you do. But you
don't want to tell me.
You're a smart kid.
One time I was...
...stuck on a boat with
some people for 4 months.
A lifeboat?
No, it was a...
...big, white yacht.
You're the bodyguard, aren't you?
What do you know about it?
I've got ears.
I'll remember that.
This is just in the last 6 months.
Have you ever had these
professionally assessed?
-I heard you were in the Secret Service.
-That's right.
You guard the main man?
I was 2 years with
Carter, 4 with Reagan.
Reagan got shot.
Not on my shift.
Good.
This could be something.
Do you think it could be the
same guy who rigged the doll?
Did you tell Miss Marron?
About the doll?
We said there'd been an electrical
problem, like a short circuit.
She doesn't need this kind of worry.
It'd really upset her.
What about the police?
No need. No one got hurt.
The chauffeur got hurt.
That was nothing.
It was just our people there.
I think we should show him the room.
Is this her bedroom?
She sleeps in the room next
to Fletcher's down the hall.
Sy had this done for a magazine layout.
Superstars in their boudoirs.
Did you see it?
We found the letter here.
Someone was in here?
Someone broke in and
masturbated on the bed.
-And she doesn't know?
-Are you kidding?
It'd really freak her out.
What do you think?
Someone penetrates the house...
...gets upstairs, jerks off on the bed.
I'd say...
...that qualifies as a problem.
We don't need this.
What kind?
-The house is wide open.
-Excuse me?
The house is wide open.
You people have no clue what
security is or how to achieve it.
I'll accommodate your work.
I can't protect her like this.
Like what?
I won't be responsible for her safety
if she doesn't know what's going on.
I'll make her understand.
I'll talk to her.
She won't give you any static.
You have my word.
Sure she will.
So what job's perfect?
You're a bodyguard, aren't you?
Guess what? It's Oscar time again.
This year the money's on Rachel
Marron for best actress.
And with the theme song
of " I Have Nothing"...
...still big on the charts...
...the versatile actress/singer
might end up having everything.
Why'd you say your name was Edison?
To see how difficult it was to get in.
And it wasn't.
-Put it on your arm.
-What's this?
It'll stop the ache.
I bet you can fill up a whole day
washing cars and driving Miss Marron.
That's my job.
We're adding to your duties.
You're my new assistant.
Says who?
I've spent a lot of time guarding people
and I've found one thing to be true.
No matter how incompetent the assassins,
or how much they miss their target...
...one person always gets hit.
Who?
The cocky black chauffeur.
Put this in the pool.
This gate will be replaced next week.
I'll have 2 cameras here.
A face camera by the call box...
...and a scene camera on top
of this pillar, looking down.
I want these trees to be cut back so
the lights can shine onto the property.
And the people who come into the
property, make sure who they are.
I want these all cut back, okay?
She paid a lot for the estate,
she ought to be able to see it.
-What're you looking at?
-Frank.
This fence is going to come around
this area and end by the gate.
Come on. Let's go.
Not yet, not yet, not yet. Now brake!
Power.
Stop.
Come here!
Come here.
That's an unusual tactic for a
guard dog. But it's effective.
You can look around if you want.
Sorry to disturb you.
It's okay. It's an excuse to rest.
This is my personal place.
I'm the only one who works out here.
My own ego wall.
No platinum records.
This is you and Rachel?
When I was a kid, I put
together this little band.
We played school dances
and stuff like that.
Rachel joined the act
and as you can imagine...
...she was quite an entertainer.
Even then she could stop the show.
So....
I quit.
Professionally, anyway.
You never went back?
It was pretty obvious who
the star in our family was.
Lot of work went into this.
Lot of work.
No fingerprints, though.
You think this is tied to the doll?
Her manager does.
" I have nothing" is natural,
given the record, the movie.
I lost track of you after Washington.
How's the private stuff?
It's fine.
Big money?
It's big money, right?
You wouldn't want this job.
It is big money! Fuck! I knew it!
You need an assistant?
I'm due to get out of here and l
have had it with assholic behavior.
What a scumbag we're covering now.
A walking schlong senator
who shall remain nameless.
Hellfire Henry Kent.
Someone wants to pop him.
No surprise, with what the
shithead's been saying.
Do everyone a favor.
As you know, we're
non-political these days.
I'll send it to Behavioral Sciences.
I'll have an answer in a few days.
Thanks.
Why am I getting all this cooperation?
Are you kidding?
She's a big star.
Important people care about her.
Politics and showbiz, it's
the same thing these days.
Thanks.
There she is.
Can I have your autograph?
Sure you can.
We're big fans. Can we get a photo?
She'll be thrilled. You're her favorite
actress. We've seen all your movies.
Take a good one.
Thank you so much.
She'll appreciate it.
I'm surprised you didn't plug them.
Help me with this stuff.
You sign "much love, Rachel"...
...you sign, "peace and love, Rachel."
Let me set you straight on a few things.
For starters, I love this lady.
What I do for her, I do out of love.
I'm not some hired fucking gun who's
here to make her life miserable.
I do things the way she likes.
Her happiness is everything to me.
No problem. I'd like to
know how you handle things.
I handle things fine.
Watch me and learn.
Turn right.
Is that him?
What's going on?
Short cut.
Want me to do a 180?
Slow down.
Go up to the house!
Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up!
He's through messing with my life.
I'm getting sick of running up here
every time he steps on your toes.
Farmer, come in here.
-He's nuts!
-Guess who couldn't get in yesterday?
Robin Leach.
That's funny?! He speaks to 20 million
people and he can't get in here!
He had an appointment?
What about brunch at Charlie's?
Rachel goes there every Sunday.
She's not to do things
she's always done.
" Not to do things she's always done."
He's a fanatic!
So're the guys he's protecting you from.
Excuse me if I don't faint.
Then think about your son.
What do you want?
I want some peace around here!
That's right.
We're almost done.
And I want to be able to
eat brunch with my friends.
So go on Tuesdays.
Tuesday morning brunch.
Where'd you get him?
Louise, you have great stuff.
Take it all.
Try this on.
Hey, Farmer...
...want to come in with me?
Just to be safe?
You won't believe this...
...but I have a reputation
for being a bitch.
I didn't use to be.
But you get known for being a certain
way, a way people think you are...
...and pretty soon, you get like that.
Guess you can't help it.
You don't think so?
You're an expert on famous people.
I've seen a few.
And you disagree?
You can be as you choose to be.
It's an act of discipline,
but it can be done.
Is that why you never stay with your
clients? They too undisciplined for you?
Or maybe you start caring about them?
Right.
Can't you answer straight once?
You're too clever for me.
I can't keep up.
Look at me, Farmer!
You don't approve of me.
Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford.
It gets in the way? Don't like
your emotions getting to you?
Never mix business with pleasure?
That's right.
Will you grab that red jacket?
I'm here to keep you alive,
not help you shop.
Thanks.
-Two minutes.
-Three.
Wait. I want to make it really full.
Put it straight up.
Right there.
You must hold it still.
What're we looking for?
Bomb.
Don't worry, I already checked.
Put it back here a little deeper.
Hold it.
Okay, now turn it. Good.
There, right there.
Pull up there for a second.
Son-of-a...
I thought it was dinner.
Are we going somewhere else?
The Mayan.
What's that?
It's a club. Let's go.
You must tell me about these things.
I just did.
Nice suit, Frank.
I want you to keep this.
It's beautiful.
It's fitted with a radio transmitter.
The clasp sends a signal.
If there's ever a problem, press it.
I'll know you need me.
She knows how it works.
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Look!
Look at this great show.
They don't forget.
Get inside. The show's inside.
Henry, just keep driving.
How're you doing?
He's from Paris, an amazing director.
A performance artist. This is
his first video. Rachel loves it.
This is Sy's idea.
-I thought she'd talk to you.
-You said I had an exclusive.
Maybe later. What can I say?
Laurie! How are you?
You know Paul. I'll speak to you later.
She doesn't do these places.
He thinks it'll help the video.
He sent another one.
What do you mean, another one?
What do you mean?
-They didn't tell you.
-Tell me what?
There were some letters before.
Same kind of threat.
We didn't want to worry you.
And somebody got into the house.
In my house?
-Let's not get hysterical.
-We should go.
While Fletcher was there?!
The house is like Fort Knox.
-Right?
-We should go.
No one could...
-Could what?!
-Calm down.
Everyone calm down.
Let's just see how she is.
How are you?
"Watch the door" means
no candy, no flowers.
Is he out there?
He's here, isn't he?
Maybe.
We don't know that.
You know he was in my house!
Let's go home. We'll have
to make an announcement.
Fine, fine. Bill, you make it!
Tell them!
They'll tear the place apart!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...I'm sorry but...
...due to circumstances
beyond our control...
Wait!
Don't do it. It's not worth it.
No fucking freak will run me off stage.
Give it up front.
Let's go. We're on.
We're not coming.
I'm afraid Rachel will not
be able to appear tonight.
Just a minute. Give me a chance.
Bill Devaney, everybody!
Hello!
Just wanted to stop by
and maybe sing a song.
I hope you don't mind.
All right. Thank you so much!
Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest?
Let's give him a hand.
Go for it, Rachel.
Want to see my new video?
Are we having a communication problem?
What?
Are we having a communication problem?
Keep this aisle clear.
I know what you're saying.
You've got a job to do. But you
must understand Rachel does too.
And that's what she's doing.
Out there.
Look, she's so hot now.
If she doesn't get out there...
...she's dead.
Forget the crazy death threats,
if she doesn't sing...
...she's dead anyway.
Handled properly, this thing could be
worth a million in free publicity.
No.
-It could clinch the nomination.
-One word in print about this...
Out of the way!
I'll get it.
Follow me!
-Let us through!
-Fuck you!
Where's the fucking limo?
Henry! It's me, Sy!
Stop it! Fuck!
Keep driving.
Never done that before.
It's been a long night.
Don't you want to know
why I behave that way?
I know why.
I don't want to talk about this again.
Got you, didn't I?
Bet you wonder what I'm doing.
You didn't know I jog?
Afraid I might get picked
off in my running suit?
No. I'm afraid that I'm going
to have to jog with you.
Will you walk with me?
I know this is kind of late...
...but thank you.
I'm glad you're here.
And I'm going to try to cooperate.
That would be good.
Farmer, I have this problem.
This minor little problem.
I'd like to go out for an evening.
With a guy. Like a date.
But...
...I can't go out...
...on a date because you must
be with me every minute.
What if he wants to invite me up
to his place? Will you come too?
So...
...the only thing I can figure...
...is for you to take me out.
That's what I was wondering.
You know?
What do you think?
Only if you want to.
Only if you want to.
God, this is so embarrassing.
You decide, okay?
Sandy Harris is on the phone.
Tell her I'll call her back.
I'm getting fixed up.
He didn't look like he wanted to die.
There's a big difference between...
...wanting to die and not fearing death.
And so because he had no fear
of death, he was invincible?
What do you think?
He sure creamed them all in the end.
That was a good movie.
How many times have you seen it?
62 times.
-I've seen it a lot.
-You can say that!
I've seen it a lot.
Your kind of place?
Your kind of music?
Absolutely.
You figure no one can get by you here.
If someone's willing to swap his life
for a kill, nothing can stop him.
What do I need you for?
He might get me instead.
You're ready to die for me?
That's the job.
And you'd do it?
Why?
I can't sing.
Maybe there is some glory in saving a
president or somebody but...
...just anybody?
Like you?
Yeah, like me.
It's a matter of discipline.
I don't trust discipline.
I know at that crucial
moment I'd cop out.
It happens.
But not to you, fierce Frank.
It happens.
So have you ever liked anybody?
What do you mean?
Like me, a girl?
Yeah, a long time ago.
What happened?
Do you mind if I ask?
You mind if I don't answer?
I don't want to pry.
Oh, yeah, I can see that.
What?
She didn't die, did she?
While you were protecting
her she got killed, right?
God! That's not it, is it?
That's it, isn't it?
Nobody's perfect.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I'm sorry.
Nice try, though.
It was less dramatic than that.
She didn't love me anymore.
Can you imagine that?
No, not really.
So...
...is this a full-service date?
I'm just asking you to dance.
Come on.
You can dance, can't you?
This is kind of a cowboy song?
Nothing. It's nothing.
I mean, it's so depressing.
Have you listened to the words?
-It is kind of depressing.
-Yes, it is.
It's one of those somebody's-
always-leaving-somebody songs.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.
It's very quiet here.
You ever going to hang these up?
Maybe when I'm here long enough.
West Virginia University Football.
God!
Take a look at you.
What'd you play?
The end.
Were you tough?
No, I was fast.
So you were in the Secret Service?
What made you get out?
Money.
I can see your tastes are extravagant.
May l?
Be careful.
You're a hard one to figure out.
A bodyguard must know very little peace.
Watch this.
I've never felt this safe before.
No one could get by you.
Right now it might not be too difficult.
What are you doing?
I don't want to get confused
about what I'm doing here.
I'm not confused.
You pay me to protect you.
That's what I do.
Did I do something wrong?
Nothing.
Then what is it?
Do you want me to beg?
What's going on, Frank?
I want to keep straight what my job is.
And what is that, exactly?
Making me feel like shit?
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
Don't apologize. Just tell me
what I did. I'm a big girl.
You didn't do anything.
It was me.
I got involved with my client.
Your client?!
I made a mistake.
So you're not attracted
to your client anymore?
Christ, I told you why!
I can't protect you like this.
So that's it for me?
That's it?
I don't believe it!
Accept it, or fire me.
But I can't fuck you.
She's real mad at you, isn't she?
She said she doesn't know why
you're being so shitty to her.
I don't like you to use that language.
I spent a lot of time learning not to
react to things like other people.
That's my job.
It doesn't always work.
It doesn't always work.
I don't think I understand.
I'm an old man compared to you
and I don't understand either.
I'm starting to get the feeling...
...that I never will.
I thought you'd like to know.
Everyone said she was a sure thing.
But you already knew that.
Sorry. It's completely out of line.
It was none of my business.
It's off to Miami today for Best
Actress nominee Rachel Marron.
She'll give two AlDS charity concerts
at the Fontainebleau Hilton.
$1,000 a plate, no less.
And it's a brave man who'd
deny she's worth every cent.
This is Mobile 1 to Station 2.
Zero 2, engineering.
Have them do a 14 reference to
presidential suite balcony.
It's okay. They're cleared.
Mobile 2 to Catering. Security
says to clear kitchen aisle...
...of all obstructions and traffic,
effective immediately.
Mobile 2 to front of house.
Security requests updated list of
all ticket holders for concert.
Please fax copies of any names which are
added to the list to Security Office.
What a silly job this is.
Okay, we're rolling!
-Showtime, everybody!
-ls this necessary?
Yes, it is. Let's go.
Quit bitching. You get paid for this.
Rachel, can you give us
a couple of minutes?
-How do you like our city?
-I love it! I love Miami!
Did you arrange all this?
Hey, that's me!
Hello, Frank.
It's been a long time.
You working?
Not technically, but
the Governor may come...
...so I thought I'd give a light check.
Someone else is covering him now.
How old's she?
Maybe 18.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Listen, you're so right.
I want you all to have a good time...
...and drink as much of Ben Schiller's
liquor as you possibly can.
Thank you.
I'd call that a step
up from the President.
Probably sings better too.
Handful.
Lost track of you
after the Reagan thing.
Wasn't your fault.
You weren't even there.
I need a drink.
Orange juice.
Who're you?
Greg Portman.
I take it you've met my bodyguard.
We used to work together.
Well, well, well.
What do you do now?
Same thing as Farmer.
Two samurai, huh?
So are you working now?
Not right now.
Good.
Because I'm the only person in
this room that needs protection.
Let's get a drink. A real one.
Orange juice, sir?
I've been watching you all
night from across the room.
Why don't you go back and watch?
No, I'm not doing this.
You are.
Please go now.
Not right now.
Mr. Portman was just leaving.
Good night, Rachel.
Shit.
What are you looking at?
You probably never had a heavy night
in your whole disciplined life.
Coffee?
You're a self-righteous bastard.
Don't laugh! Don't dare judge me!
Give me a break. I didn't tell
you to fuck everyone in the hotel!
Fuck this. I don't need this shit.
Industrial detergent.
It matches the traces in the glue.
We'll nail this sucker.
Don't take too long.
It's good money, isn't it?
It's good money.
-Where is she?
-I don't know.
-Where's Tony?
-I thought you were with her.
Thuringer, this is Farmer.
Where's your man at the door?
The door to the suite! Where is he?
Get someone up here, now!
He doesn't know.
Where're you going?
Where in the hell have you been?
I went to Bal Harbor to shop.
You want these in the bedroom?
Leave them so I can look at them.
You had us worried. You know
you're not supposed to do that.
I'll do what I want when I want.
Besides...
...I'm tired of hanging
around deadbeats.
No offense Tony.
Once more and I'm gone.
You remember something.
You work here. You work for me!
Where're you going?
To check the route, as usual.
Did Fletcher call?
Gomez!
What are you doing?
None of your fucking business.
Move!
Stick it up your ass!
Stop! Don't hurt my husband, mister!
Please, don't hurt my husband.
He not up to nothing.
I'm sorry.
Hello.
Mommy?
Fletcher, is that you?
Listen.
I'm through, Bill.
I'm through. I'll get you
back to L.A. and that's it.
Fletcher's guard'll cover you.
She got another call.
-I don't care.
-It was him. Same guy.
I don't care!
It really shook her up. She thought
it was Fletcher calling from L.A.
I know she'll be reasonable now.
Come on.
Save it, Devaney!
Those who hire me don't have to be
convinced to save their own lives!
Call me when she's ready.
Nothing that's happened
between us matters.
I understand now.
You must believe me because
I'm not going to beg.
It wasn't what he said...
...it was the way he said it.
Frank, I need you. I'm afraid.
And I hate my fear.
Please protect me. Protect Fletcher.
If anything happened to him....
I can't.
I can't.
I can't protect you like this.
It's impossible.
The odds are all on his side.
I will do whatever you say.
I'd want to take you away from here.
I can do that.
It'd mean cancelling your concerts.
All right.
No more Sy.
Give Devaney and Tony a vacation.
Okay.
You cross me up this time, l
swear I'll kill you myself.
Lake's low.
It'll rise when it thaws.
They all in trouble?
Just one.
He likes you.
So is that going to protect us?
He's a trained noisemaker.
Come here, Foster.
Just what we need.
I don't like big dogs.
They don't know who they're eating.
And this one does?
Yeah, this one does.
Excuse me.
Katherine had this place
organized the way she wanted it.
That's Frank's mama.
Fletcher can't swim very well.
He better stay in the boat then.
Frank says you're a singer.
That's right.
We're kind of out of things up here.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
You must be very successful if
you need someone like Frank.
It's quiet here.
Frank spent 6 months here
after that Reagan thing.
Reagan thing?
Frank was gone when Reagan was shot.
He never got over it.
That's the day we buried Katherine.
He's a rascal now.
Tell us.
I never hit him.
-Ever.
-You should have.
That's unusual for my people.
So what happens is, he's
about 10 years old...
...and he starts complaining to me.
How about that.
Dad, I'll tell them about the
time you stripped in court.
I want to hear this.
I'm proud of that!
So, anyway, he starts
playing tackle football...
...when he's 10 and one day he comes to
me and says he's afraid of being hit.
Says it's my fault. "How come
you never hit me?" he says to me.
How about that? He got over it.
Turned into one hell of a wide receiver.
He was always like that, my son.
Couldn't stand being afraid.
Something scared him, he'd just keep
doing it until the fear went away.
His mama was the same way.
You have a beautiful family.
-You had enough to eat?
-Fletcher, wipe your mouth.
-Save some for dessert.
-You through, bucket mouth?
I won't tell about when you
were 13 and discovered girls.
Come on.
You can run but you can't hide.
I'm black, right?
You know you're white. Your move!
My move? You're sure?
The last move, I took your rook.
That's right.
How long has this been going on?
3 years.
First year he had me on the run.
What do you think?
Knight to king-four.
City kid.
Son, you come here and sit with me.
Well, that's it for me, guys.
I'm going to bed.
You're in trouble.
Foster, right here. Turn around.
Good night, Rachel.
Good night, Frank.
Good night, Foster. Good night.
It's good to hear you laugh.
Stay.
You're very thorough.
What's happening with you and Rachel?
One minute she has magnetic
hands and the next she hates you.
I don't know what's going on now.
You follow all her moves this closely?
It's a living.
No, it's not.
You must think my life's pretty sick.
You must. I do.
Then why don't you change it?
Is it that easy?
You're a lovely woman.
But you don't want me?
I'm surprised. Thorough fellow like you.
Why stop at one sister when
you can fuck them both?
I make my mistakes.
But you didn't say no to the boss.
Is this elk?
- A dear?
- Yes
Big.
First time I've heard church
music in the middle of the week.
Jesus loves me, oh, yes, he does.
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.
For the Bible...
...tells me so.
-Hi, kiddo.
-Hi, honey.
Where's Fletcher?
Help!
He can't swim!
Help!
Help!
Let me have him!
What were you doing?
You're crazy!
You are out of your mind!
You could have drowned him!
You could have drowned him!
I'm sorry.
I got careless.
How will we get the boat back?
Put them in there.
Someone's cut the phone lines. Could
be anywhere between here and town.
Both cars are dead. I don't see how.
Who knows you're here?
I don't know. This place
has nothing to do with her.
Maybe it has to do with you.
And we can't walk out of here at night.
I know.
We'll stay and walk out at first light.
I was an idiot last night.
What'd you think about today?
I think this is no maniac.
He knows what he's doing.
You're right. He does.
Tell me about it.
-Who is it?
-He almost got Fletcher...
How do we stop him?
-He almost got the baby!
-Who is it?
I don't know.
Call it off.
He doesn't even know who hired him.
I don't know who he is and
he doesn't know who I am.
How did you do it?
How?
I went to a bar in East L.A.
I asked around. And there was this guy.
Name?
-Armando.
-Give me his name!
Armando.
He arranged it, that's all I know.
It's all paid?
Is it paid for?
And then some, okay? Till it's done.
He keeps going until he kills her?
-What's the name of the bar?
-I'm not sure.
I was stoned.
All right. How about the letters?
The letters came first. I don't
know who's writing the letters.
Shit, but they're reading my mind.
Those are my thoughts. I hate her.
It made me think I could do it.
But I would never hurt the baby.
I would never hurt Fletcher!
I know.
You must stop it.
We will.
You and me.
Don't you want to know why?
You told me.
She has everything.
What if we can't find him?
Stay here and don't move.
-It's me!
-God!
What's happening?
Stay with her!
-Where's Nicki?
-No! No, stop! I'm the one--
-Dad?
-We're okay.
-Doesn't make sense.
-What do you mean?
We got him.
What do you mean? Where?
Here. Last night. In L.A.
You should see this guy's locker.
He's obsessed with her.
You sure it's him?
Forensics say a 100% positive lD.
And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4.
We know you did it.
Ray's with him now.
It's you that sent her the letters.
We don't need you to admit it.
We know!
We know it!
Whoever you got down there wasn't here
last night. This was a professional.
This is crazy.
What do you want to do?
How long can you keep him?
All he's done is write some letters.
48 hours maximum. You know the deal.
I know.
Strict security surrounded the funeral
of music executive Nicki Marron...
...who was shot at a lakeside
retreat by an unknown intruder.
Nicki was the eldest
sister of Rachel Marron.
A spokesman for the Oscar-nominated
actress said she was devastated...
...and added that naturally it cast a
pall over the upcoming award ceremony.
You okay?
Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.
How about yourself?
I couldn't sleep.
It was so scary, just thinking about it.
Are you scared?
Everybody's afraid of something.
That's how we know we
care about things...
...when we're scared to lose them.
What are you afraid of?
I think you should try
to go back to sleep.
Is it the man who killed Nicki?
Are you afraid of him?
Then what?
What are you afraid of?
I'm afraid of not...
...being there.
It's late. Want me to
take you up to your room?
May I sit down?
It isn't over yet, is it?
So he'll come again?
It's possible.
At the Oscars?
Maybe.
Back in Squirrel Hill...
...I started betting my friends 50 bucks
each that someday I'd win an Oscar.
So it's very important for them
to see me up there if I win.
If every one of those pikers comes
through, it'd add up to a lot of money.
I don't know, Rachel.
I think it's still dangerous.
I didn't get here by doing
the smart thing every time.
How about you?
Out there on the edge.
Haven't you done something
that didn't make sense...
...except inside you? In your stomach?
I know you have.
Because no one gets good without it.
And I know you're good.
Look...
...I don't know why this is happening...
...but I know it's not your fault.
And I hope you can hear me because
this is the way I say I'm sorry.
So...
...I'm going to the
Oscars and see if I win.
And I won't worry about
it at all, because...
...I have you to protect me.
That's right.
That's right.
We'll go straight back to the Green Room.
Got that, Tony?
Tony knows what he's doing.
I wish you guys would relax.
Nothing bad's going to happen.
Right?
Unless I lose the award.
Jesus, what a crew!
Screw it.
I'm tired of worrying.
When your time is up...
...it's up.
Right, Frank?
-Rachel Marron, how are you?
-Fine. And you?
Good. You look lovely.
-Thank you.
-And they love you, don't they?
They're going wild!
So are you the queen of this night?
Let's hope so.
Good luck. Everybody's pulling for you.
Rachel Marron, everybody.
And the award for best
achievement in sound...
...goes to...
...Kay Colvin...
...and Mychal Smith for "Hot and Cold."
Thank you so much.
I want to thank our producers.
There is a gap, house left, rows EE FF.
Get me some fillers.
You look beautiful. I just need to
tell you your responsibilities.
Now it's Best Sound.
Then a song, then you.
At 8:07, you will be
presenting with Clive Healy.
Your lines.
The TelePrompTer is straight ahead
and, we pray, working perfectly.
I understand it's my honor
to escort you on stage.
That's right and I don't like it one
bit that you look skinnier than me.
I wish.
How's the Hollywood cricket scene?
Coming out of commercial. Five,
four, three, two. Cue music.
Cue Robert.
Welcome back to the Academy Awards.
Stand by, dancers.
I just heard that in New York
the economy is so bad...
...that the Mafia has
laid off five judges.
I'm going to look around,
then come back for her.
No more carrots.
Did you like the couple that just won?
Did you ever see a woman on
sound that looked like that?
She must have been the boom girl.
Looked like the bada-bing-bada-boom
girl right there.
If she's working sound, who's listening?
Lighting change.
And he was eloquent: "It's the
most happiest day of my life."
Bet his mother was very
most proudest of him then.
20 seconds.
Hi, Frank. How are you?
Why're you here?
-On the job.
-Who?
Him.
Short-term gig, but...
...profitable.
Frank, I'm sorry about Miami.
Cue music.
Cue dancers.
Back to work.
See you at the Governor's ball.
She sounds great.
I want her run out of town.
She must go!
Tony, you there?
Tony?
I have a feeling this is the night.
He'll go for her on camera.
That's crazy!
That's how he wants it to look;
but he's not crazy, he's very clever.
Listen, I need you to help me tonight.
You can't use that thing.
There's bad breakthrough.
I must disconnect you.
I'll do it.
You get it back after the show.
What's wrong?
Ready to go?
Shall we go?
Gentlemen, is this necessary?
Must we have everyone?
We have our own man at the door!
Please.
No, I want him.
Fine.
Stay alert.
Let us brighten this firmament.
Coming through, please.
How much time do we have?
Resetting staircases.
Scenery coming in.
30 seconds to lighting change.
30 seconds. Don't panic.
Clear this area, please.
Rachel, up, to the right and through.
Clive, up, to the left and through.
You'll meet on the landing.
Watch your step going down.
Somebody spilled water.
Shall we?
Do try to relax. I know
you must be very excited.
Thank you.

God, hurry up!
How's it going?
It's under control.
It won't be the same without you.
How you doing?
You shouldn't be here.
So you're quitting show business?
Too bad. You had talent.
Fletcher, go to the plane.
How's the new guy?
He's got white hair.
-He's very good.
-But did you have to get me an old man?
I don't trust you.
