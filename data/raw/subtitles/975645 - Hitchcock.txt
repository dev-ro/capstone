- It's lucky it didn't reach the house.
- Yeah.
You know,
there's gonna be a lot more jobs at
that factory in Milwaukee come June.
- I could put in a word.
- You can't leave us, Henry.
She needs us both.
Can you stop being a momma's boy
for one second?
I'm not trying to hurt you, but Jesus,
you got to live your own life sometime.
That woman can take care
of her own goddamn...
Oh, good evening.
Brother has been killing brother
since Cain and Abel,
yet even I didn't see that coming.
I was as blind-sided as poor
old Henry down there.
Apparently the authorities
shared my naivet√©.
In other words,
they believed the young man's story
that Henry fell,
hit his head on a stone,
and died of smoke asphyxiation.
On the other hand,
if they hadn't believed him,
Ed Gein would never have had
the opportunity to commit those
heinous crimes
for which he became most famous.
And we, of course, well... We wouldn't
have our little movie, would we?
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
Here he comes!
This thing's going to be gigantic.
I wish I had 20% of the take.
Does tonight's incredible reaction
surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock?
No, when I was planning
North by Northwest
I could already hear the
screams and the laughter.
Any questions, my dear?
Pity.
Mr. Hitchcock,
you've directed 46 motion pictures.
You're the most famous director
in the history of the medium...
But you're sixty years old.
Shouldn't you just quit
while you're ahead?
Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms
gouged out with arrows.
That must have been rather painful.
Talking of arrows,
did you read that little snippet from A.H.
Weiler's review in The New York Times?
He said he found the climax
to be "overdrawn."
Yes, well I doubt Mr. Weiler has
had a climax in years.
"North by Northwest
reminds us of Mr. Hitchcock's
earlier, more inventive spy thrillers."
And there is an accompanying list.
The "New Masters of Suspense."
Why do they keep looking for new ones
when they still have the original?
Oh, don't be maudlin,
you know how much it aggravates me.
Just stop reading them.
You've been reading them for a week.
Tell me, my dear,
do you think I'm too old?
Yes, you're a true relic.
And lest we forget,
a notably corpulent one.
You always know precisely
where to plunge the dagger, don't you?
Right between the shoulder blades.
I learned it from your pictures.
Where, may I ask, are you off to?
I'm going to have brunch with Whit
after I drop you off at the studio.
Would you care to join us?
We've just established that
I'm far too corpulent
to be seen in broad daylight.
Oh, you'll feel better when
you find a new project.
Hasn't Peggy unearthed any
decent books for you recently?
Yes, sleeping pills with dust jackets.
So what do you think?
Very presentable.
Hurry up, dear, you're pruning.
- Good Morning.
- Ms. Hitchcock.
Mr. Hitchcock.
Sirs.
There's a project out there waiting
for you, Hitch. I promise you.
- I hope so. Thank you, love.
- Have a good day.
I'm treading water, Peggy. I need
something fresh, something different.
Without expensive stars to pretty it up.
Fox is offering you The Diary of
Anne Frank for the third time.
The audience would spend the entire
picture waiting for Miss Frank
to discover the corpse
I'd hidden in the attic.
- Wouldn't you agree, Nuncio?
- Si.
MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book,
Casino Royale.
Cary Grant.
Definitely your style.
Doesn't she know I just made that movie?
It's called North by Northwest.
"Style," my dear, is mere self-plagiarism.
Oh, scusi!
A nice, clean, nasty little piece of work.
That's what I'm looking for.
I shall see what I can find.
- Serves you right.
- Yeah.
You know, Hitch always says that
your private life
is in danger of being more entertaining
than any of your plots.
I'm surprised he let me have you
for the whole afternoon.
Especially looking so beautiful.
So tell me,
what are you working on these days?
Me? Oh, oh...
I'm satisfied working in my garden.
Oh!
Well that's one lucky garden.
All this relentless sycophancy is
actually giving me indigestion.
What are you after?
I was hoping you may be able to apply
your considerable pruning skills to this.
Ah, all is finally revealed.
Whit, you are a little predictable.
The most fun I ever had
was working with you.
Anything come up, my dear?
Anything at all?
Nothing suitable.
Is that water
or do I need to call Alma?
Do whatever you want.
Anthony Boucher says that
this book Psycho by Robert Bloch is
"fiendishly entertaining."
It sounds ghastly.
Everyone in town's already passed.
And who is everyone, pray?
The story department finished the
coverage this morning.
This about Ed Gein,
the mass murderer from Wisconsin?
Oh, yeah.
"Graphic elements of brutal violence,
voyeurism, transvestitism and incest."
Very nice. Not your average
run-of-the-mill nutcase, is he?
You're kidding.
Peggy, this is the boy
who dug up his own mother.
- Hungry?
- Famished.
You can have half a grapefruit later
if you're good.
Listen, Hitch.
Whit gave me the galleys to his new book
yesterday at lunch.
I've already got some ideas
about how we can adapt it.
It's elegant. It's sophisticated.
It's full of intrigue.
You mean the book or Mr. Whitfield Cook?
This could be the one, Hitch.
I'll read it later.
There are calories in that, you know.
Ma?
Ma...
Aren't you cold?
No need to be afraid, Ma.
Oh, God!
I just want you to read
this little bit here.
It takes place in the motel bathroom.
"Mary started to scream,
"and then the curtains parted further
"and a hand appeared,
holding a butcher's knife.
"It was the knife that, a moment later,
cut off her scream,
and her head."
Charming.
Doris Day should do it as a musical.
That is nothing but low-budget
horror movie claptrap.
But what if someone really good
made a horror picture?
Just think of the shock value.
Killing off your leading lady
halfway through.
I mean, you are intrigued,
are you not, my dear?
Come on, admit it.
Admit it.
Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.
You shouldn't wait till halfway through.
Kill her off after thirty minutes.
Well!
Peggy,
I want you to summon your minions.
- Minions?
- Right away.
Certainly.
And who might they be?
Get them started buying copies of Psycho.
- How many do you need?
- All of them. Every copy, nationwide.
Scour every bookshop, every library.
And I mean everywhere.
Psycho is going to be my next movie,
and I don't want anyone to know the ending
until they see it in the theater.
Look at that.
Are you sure about this?
This is so unlike you.
That is exactly the point, my dear.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
good afternoon.
I see you've all been devouring
the article on Mr. Ed Gein.
Violent chap,
and the real-life inspiration
behind Psycho.
All of us harbor
dark recesses of violence,
and horror.
Fascinating, isn't it?
When the Wisconsin Police Department
raided Mr. Gein's farm,
they opened the door...
And voila!
They discovered ten female heads
with the tops sawn off.
Pass these around, would you?
And have a look.
Masks of human skin.
A pair of lips on a drawstring
for a window shade.
Oh, yes, and a jug
containing human noses.
Is this really going to be your
next picture, Mr. Hitchcock?
Well, that is my intention, yes, madam.
My only wish is that Ed
Gein looked a little
more like William Holden
instead of Elmer Fudd.
By the way, try the finger sandwiches.
They're real fingers.
Bloody hell!
Now don't pretend you're
not upset he hasn't read it.
I'm not.
I'm a big boy, I can take it.
Well, I loved it.
It must be great fun to research.
Do you really think he will read it?
Ah, speak of the devil.
Hitch, I ran all over town
trying to find a copy of Psycho
but I simply cannot find one.
- I wonder how that could have happened.
- Yeah.
Don't stop looking on my behalf.
Hitch, you should come.
I've seen happier faces on a school bus
going over a cliff.
But they can't stop looking, can they?
Audiences want to be shocked, Barney.
They want something different.
And this is it.
Every time you want to do
something different
like The Wrong Man or Vertigo,
someone loses money.
So we should stop trying to
give them something new?
You owe Paramount one last picture,
Hitch.
Can't you do something like
North by Northwest
but for us this time
instead of for MGM?
Psycho.
No one respects
the name Hitchcock like Paramount.
Are you telling me "no," Barney?
I think you know me better than that,
Hitch.
What a putz.
You know what his family did
before they built those movie palaces?
Ran a grocery store.
My father ran a grocery store.
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.
He should show some respect.
They think I've lost my touch, Lew.
My association with television has
cheapened me.
Are you referring to that deal I got you
where Bristol-Meyers pays you 29 grand
an episode and you own the negative?
That's my kind of cheap.
They just want the same thing
over and over and over.
They've put me in a coffin and
now they're nailing down the lid.
Hitch, as your agent,
I will never let that happen.
How much you think you can
make this picture for?
$800,000, give or take.
You're home early.
Oh, it's lovely actually.
You know, I'm disappointed
you didn't give Whit's book a chance.
And what about Whit?
Is he disappointed?
Oh, no.
He knows you well enough.
Look at that!
Time for a new one anyway.
Well you'd better enjoy the pool,
my dear, while you can.
We might not have it much longer.
Why?
Paramount refuses to finance the movie.
Oh, Hitch, I'm so sorry.
Lew can't find the money.
At least, not fast enough.
Well why not wait?
No.
Just going to have to go it alone,
old girl.
Finance it ourselves.
Are we going to have to sell
the whole house or just the pool?
I just want to do the film.
I will ask you this once
and I'll never mention it again.
Why this one, Hitch?
It's not just because so many people
are saying "no," is it?
Do you remember the fun we had
when we started out all those years ago?
We didn't have any money then, did we?
We didn't have any time, either,
but we took risks, do you remember?
We experimented.
We invented new ways of making pictures
because we had to.
I want to feel
that kind of freedom again.
Like we used to, you know?
We are about to propose
a restructured deal for Psycho.
I'm listening.
We finance it independently.
Hitch waives his directorial fee.
Paramount only distributes it,
in exchange for 40% of the profits.
Interesting. But what exactly
is Paramount distributing?
Is this still a picture about a queer
killing people in his mother's dress?
What this picture is about
is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock.
- No one is arguing that.
- Barney,
it's very simple.
This is Mr. Hitchcock's next film.
Are you in or are you out?
Fine. We'll take that deal.
If you can get the money.
We already have the money, Barney.
Who do I make it out to?
If this picture fails, Alma,
we'll be in for a long,
humiliating bout of crow-eating.
- It'll be splendid.
- Are you sure?
Of the movie? Not at all.
But of you? Unquestionably.
Ahem.
- Joe Stefano. Good to meet you.
- Sit down.
I'm sorry I was late.
My shrink session went overtime.
I see him every day
and it's still not enough.
I thought it was only director's
assistants who needed psychiatrists,
not writers.
Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?
I have to confess, Mr. Stefano,
It boggles my brain
just trying to imagine
what you and your shrink
could possibly talk about every day.
The usual: Sex. Rage. My mother.
Good morning, sir.
Let me have a look at you.
The only thing worse than a visit to
the dentist is a visit to censor.
Whatever you do, Hitch,
don't lose your temper.
- See you later.
- Good luck.
The Code will absolutely not permit you
to show a knife
penetrating a woman's flesh.
I assure you, Geoffrey,
my murders are always models of taste
and discretion.
Is there any improper
suggestion of nudity in this
murder scene in the shower?
She won't be nude.
She'll be wearing a shower cap.
We might accept a shot
from outside the bathroom window
of Marion in silhouette
above the shoulders.
Provided that the glass is frosted.
Thank you.
And the scene with the toilet.
It is completely necessary
to show the toilet,
because Marion Crane attempts
to flush evidence down it.
Remnants of which are later
discovered by her sister.
These remnants, you understand,
are clues to her vanishing.
No American movie has ever found it
necessary to show a toilet,
let alone to flush one.
Perhaps we ought to
shoot the film in France
and use a bidet instead.
Mr. Hitchcock,
if this office denies you a seal,
and we're certainly heading
in that direction,
your movie will not be released
in a single theater in this country.
Will you be making jokes then?
Everyone in Hollywood resents me.
I make them millions of dollars,
and every year I sit at those
dreadful award show dinners,
waiting for someone just to say,
"You're good."
They take sadistic pleasure in
denying me that one little moment.
That must hurt.
Deeply, Ed. Deeply.
Sorry, doctor.
I'm just not used to this...
process.
Just think of me more like a friend.
It's just that more and more
I've been having these...
impulses.
What kind of impulses?
Strong ones.
Here.
The Lazar Office tell me
he's crazy to work with you.
Tell Swifty Lazar he should not have
overexposed his client on television.
Unlike some we could mention.
- Anthony Perkins.
- Oh...
Think of the duality
he could bring to the role of Norman.
The rage lurking behind that
little boy grin.
The winsome charm he uses
to keep from being found out.
Why, Alma,
you're not suggesting Mr. Perkins is...?
Hm.
What?
I like your office.
I can't count how many times
I've seen Strangers on a Train.
And Rope.
Well, Norman Bates is
the logical extension
of those two characters in that movie.
Appealing, sensitive,
suffering the terrible burden
of being forced to pretend to be
something he is not.
I'm sick of all this romantic crap
the studios keep shoving me into.
But my only worry is,
well, playing Norman might
cut too close to home.
How so?
When I was younger,
I was incredibly close to my mother.
So close that I remember
wishing my father would drop dead.
And then when I was five,
he did just that.
He keeled over from a heart attack.
You see I've been guilty my whole life,
Mr. Hitchcock.
You know,
I'm getting blisters just watching you.
Oh, stop complaining.
A bit of fresh air and exercise
will do you good.
I'm going to have a drink.
No you're not. You're
going to finish that hedge.
You've got to go all the
way around there, all
the way around there, all
the way around there.
- It's impossible. I can't do that.
- Yes you can.
You know, I was thinking, if I could
get Grace Kelly to play the girl,
they'd let me get away with murder.
Well you can't. She's a princess now,
which makes her permanently unattainable.
And all the more desirable.
What about Deborah Kerr?
Lew mentioned her.
No, she's too Scottish.
What about Janet Leigh?
I know she's normally the "good girl,"
but she was awfully good in Touch of Evil.
You remember how you always used to remark
on her figure at the Wassermans' parties?
Yeah.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
- Lovely to see you.
- Charmed.
- Hi.
- Hello, Janet. How are you?
Wonderful to see you.
- Well, my dear, you look very beautiful.
- Thank you.
Very beautiful.
Of course the real
secret of Mrs. Simpson's
appeal to the Duke of Windsor
was that she could make a toothpick
feel like a cigar.
Oh, I've been so immersed
in preparing to play Marion
I'd almost forgotten how to laugh.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
Now, now, you must try
the banana shortcake.
Oh, no. Nothing for me, thank you.
I'm watching my figure.
Yes, you're not the only one.
We're fine, thank you.
George, bring her the banana shortcake.
In fact, make that two large portions.
Thank you.
Now tell me, my dear, how else have you
prepared for the part of Marion Crane?
Well, I've written an entire history
for her,
which seems a little silly, I know,
but it really does help.
- It doesn't sound silly at all.
- No?
Why don't you tell us
one of her deepest secrets?
Well, she leads a double life.
At the Lowery Office,
she wears Tweed perfume.
But when she's with Sam,
she recklessly breaks out
her most expensive bottle.
"My Sin" by Lanvin.
- "My Sin"?
- Yes.
Good Lord!
I do have a concern or two.
I'm an actress, of course,
but I'm first a wife and a mother.
And I'm just curious to know...
How are you going to shoot
this shower scene?
Yes, you and the Shurlock Office.
It's only that, well, from here up,
I'm not exactly boyish.
Allow me to set your mind at rest,
my dear.
I will be shooting short bits of film
from various angles.
Cut together, the montage
will only suggest nudity.
Suggest violence.
Nothing will actually be shown.
But of course, having you in the shower
would make it all the more,
well, titillating.
Will you excuse me?
Alma, dear, how lovely to see you.
Oh, hello, Lillian.
You're looking a little pale.
No wonder with that thing
your husband's working on now.
You can't possibly approve.
Why are you letting him do
something so tasteless?
Don't upset yourself, darling.
It's only a bloody movie.
I can't believe
you made Vera Miles play the sister.
Well, I've still got her under contract.
May as well get something out of her.
Rather a thankless role,
don't you think?
For an utterly thankless girl.
Horrible.
The old man really is unhappy with me,
isn't he?
Wait till you see the undergarments
he has picked out for you.
Okay. Well, I am just going to
have to keep telling myself,
one more picture
and I'm free as a bird.
So I've made a list of places
where we can tighten our belts.
Huh?
We could all learn the art of
self-restraint, couldn't we, Alfred?
Gardeners once a week,
weekend off for the driver...
No, that's impossible.
We'll have to find other places to cut.
There aren't any other places.
And there's be no more shipments
flown in from Maxim's of Paris.
We can't afford it.
The foie gras at Chasen's
is more than adequate.
But those geese are from Barstow,
not from Marseilles.
Yes, well we all have
to make our sacrifices
for the greater good, don't we, Alfred?
I'll go get the knives.
Am I making a terrible mistake?
What if it's another Vertigo?
Just get the first take under your belt.
You'll be fine.
Are you decent, my dear?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Am I all right?
- Perfect.
- Wow.
- Morning.
- Morning.
I want to thank you once again
for this opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.
You may call me "Hitch."
Hold the cock.
Well look at you two.
America's favorite boy and girl next door.
Yes, and we're about to move
to a whole new neighborhood.
- Morning, Janet. Morning, Tony.
- Morning, Vera.
- Thanks for the wardrobe, Hitch.
- Do you approve?
You're the genius.
One thing, though.
My script is missing its last ten pages.
Everyone's script is missing ten pages
until Alma finishes the revisions.
You're just in time for the Oath.
- The what?
- The Oath.
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.
Would you all raise your right hands?
That includes you, Vera Miles.
- I do solemnly promise...
- I do solemnly promise...
- That I will not divulge...
- That I will not divulge...
The plot nor the many
secrets of Psycho...
The plot nor the many
secrets of Psycho...
- To friends, relatives...
- To friends, relatives...
- Trade reporters...
- Trade reporters...
Not even outgoing
President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Thank you all very much.
Here we are, Norman's inner sanctum.
Now, Hitch.
Explain to me
why I'm watching Marion undress?
I feel like I should
take offense at that.
Perhaps Norman
secretly watched his mother
preparing for her nightly bath.
Yes, maybe there was a transom
over the bathroom door?
Yeah, which he could access
by climbing on a chair,
so long as he was stealthy.
A boy's first glimpse of a naked woman
is usually his mother.
So I'm reliving the past,
repeating a ritual with Marion?
Don't ask me.
I'm just a man hiding in the corner
with my camera, watching.
My camera will tell you the truth.
The absolute truth.
Hitch, I have a question.
Why is the hole
so much larger on this side?
All the better to see you with,
my dear.
At the greatest possible angle.
And cut!
If you ask me, the credits should read
"Screenplay by Joseph Stefano
and Alma Reville."
The people who matter know.
Alma, you always know the answer.
Is this really going to work?
See you tomorrow.
Hello, stranger.
- Whit!
- Where have you been hiding?
Oh, God...!
- I've been finishing the revisions on...
- Psycho.
- Mm-hmm.
- And how is the old boy?
He is in a state of unbridled ecstasy
now that he's back on the set.
And you? How are you?
Well, two thousand words to do
for Reader's Digest on
what it's like to be married to
a man obsessed by murder.
Alma, you deserve a break.
Let's drive up to Santa Barbara.
We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy
steaks that we love so much at El Encanto.
Mr. Hitchcock,
we're ready for you on the set.
- Mr. Hitchcock.
- I'll be there in a moment.
Long line at the supermarket?
No. Actually,
I'm home earlier than I expected.
- Would you like a cocktail?
- No, and you shouldn't have one either.
- That hasn't been washed yet.
- I don't care.
Oh, I was filming all day today
with John Gavin.
He's a good-looking chap.
But really, plywood is more expressive.
I think his love scene with Janet Leigh
may be most horrifying thing
in the movie.
Even your friend Mr. Whitfield Cook
would be better in the scene.
Why don't you tell him yourself?
I'm sure he'd be very flattered.
You know, my dear,
maybe I was a bit too dismissive
about your friend
Whitfield's book.
Perhaps he and Elizabeth
could come over this weekend
and walk me through it, as they say.
Lovely woman, Elizabeth.
I was hoping you could
come to the set tomorrow.
Yes. Well,
I'll see how my day shapes up.
Yes.
You think you can get away with it,
don't you? But you can't.
You think they can't tell,
but they can.
They know.
You can feel that noose tightening
around that breakable little neck.
I mean,
you could return the money secretly,
but what would that prove?
It's too late.
Marion Crane always so tight,
so respectable,
so prim and so proper and perfect.
Untouchable unsullied Miss Crane.
Daddy's perfect little angel.
Now they all know those dirty
little secrets you've been hiding so long.
Messy, sticky little lunchtime trysts
with that oh-so-handsome failure
Mr. Samuel Loomis.
They'll smirk, they'll gossip,
and they'll whisper.
Even your boss, straight-laced,
hatchet-faced Mr. George Lowery,
why even he can smell the rancid,
pungent scent of sex all over you.
All right. Circle that and print it.
Let's get this thing fixed
once and for all.
I'm sick and tired of it.
Come on.
Why's it making that noise?
- What's it going to take to reset?
- About five.
Come in.
Thought you could use a little
pick-me-up.
- Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you.
- Not at all.
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.
I can't imagine your husband will be
too pleased with what just happened.
Well, you know.
Tony and the kids, you'd be surprised
what comes out of their mouths sometimes.
That's true.
You haven't spoken to him
much about your personal life, have you?
Hitch?
No, not really.
I'd keep it that way if I were you.
Why?
Well, it starts with him
wanting to choose your hairstyle.
Then he wants to choose your clothes,
and your friends,
and how many children you should have.
You know that poor, tortured soul
Jimmy Stewart played in Vertigo?
That's Hitch...
Only younger,
slimmer and better-looking.
Oh, I don't know.
Compared to Orson Welles,
he's a sweetheart.
See?
He's always watching.
- Jack, how long is this going to take?
- Just need five minutes.
Let's get a move on it.
We haven't got all day.
Why does it keep
burning out all the time?
- Get it fixed. What's the hold-up?
- It's still engaged.
Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene.
I don't know how strongly
I should confront Sam and the detective...
Darling, just fake it. Fake it.
You know how to do that. Act.
Where are my revisions?
Come on, does it really require
two men to carry a light stand?
Help them.
I'll take care of it
right away, Mr. Hitchcock.
All the difference when the money's
coming out of your own pocket, isn't it?
- We'll have a late lunch.
- Right.
- I'll make the reservation for 1:30.
- Oh, Whit.
What would I do without you?
- Till then, bye-bye.
- Bye.
Whit, what did you forget now?
Whit?
Whit?
- Mr. Hitchcock, sir, please...
- No, not now.
Every press outlet is dying for photos.
If we could just get one photo, please!
Get off my set! I'll have security...
Get off my set!
Just go! Get rid of this man.
He's a bloody pest.
Get him off the set now!
- Are you okay? You've gone very pale.
- I tell you get away.
Stop following me around
like a puppy dog and get me a drink.
- It's not even 3:00...
- Now give me the key to the cabinets.
Hello, Hitch.
How's the picture?
I'm hearing interesting things.
It's a miracle anyone can hear anything
above the noise coming from
Geoffrey Shurlock's office.
You know, I shouldn't be in a position of
just hearing things, Hitch.
- It's time you showed me some footage.
- Why?
To see if you're making a picture
Paramount can actually release.
As you well know,
my contract guarantees me final cut.
Your contract also says
Paramount isn't required
to distribute any film
that could cause us embarrassment.
Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis
films you're all so proud of.
I demand to see some footage.
Hitch!
You show me some damn footage now!
Hitch!
You have no idea how wonderful it is
not to have to look after someone.
I mean,
even if it's just for two hours.
So where are we going, Whit?
You haven't told me.
- I have a little surprise.
- Ooh!
- Where's your driver?
- I've been asking myself the same thing.
Well, I can give you a ride
if you'd like.
Oh, my God.
What a tiny car.
What are these things?
I keep looking at them.
- Candy corn. The girls love them.
- Candy corn?
I nicked them from Tony's dressing room.
Oh. Very nice.
I thought you only ate those
Fauchon chocolates.
Needs must when the devil drives,
my dear.
- Oh, luckily I'm driving.
- Thank God for that.
He's always had obsessions
with his leading ladies.
Just that this time it feels like
he's using them against me.
Well I suppose
he's like any great artist.
Impossible to live with,
but worth the effort.
Did you know before we got together,
I was his boss?
He had to work his way up to assistant
director before he dared ask me out.
- Really? Huh!
- Mm-hmm.
See that house over there?
- Yes.
- What do you think of it?
- Lovely, isn't it. What a great position.
- It's mine.
I just talked to Elizabeth.
She didn't say anything about it.
She doesn't know anything about it.
Nobody does.
Want to see it?
- Thank you, my dear.
- Any time.
- Can I keep these?
- Absolutely.
- Would you like one?
- No thank you.
- All right. Well, thank you.
- Hitch?
What?
What really did happen
with you and Vera?
Oh. Vera.
She was going to play
the lead in Vertigo.
Two weeks before filming
she told me was pregnant.
I was going to make her into a star.
But she chose
the life of a housewife instead.
Why do they do it, I wonder?
Why do they always betray me?
Oh, very Bohemian.
I just leased it for the off season.
A place to get away from the wife,
and kids, and writing.
Whit, I hope you don't
have the wrong idea.
If you were serious
about helping me adapt my book,
I thought it might make the perfect...
hideaway.
Relax! Naughty boys, calm down.
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you
I read your treatment of that story.
Taxi to... Where was it, dear?
- Dubrovnik.
- That's it. Dubrovnik.
- Would you care to hear my opinion?
- Well, yes, naturally.
Right, then.
Well, my dear, there's no
other way of saying it, is there?
It's a stillborn.
How so?
First of all,
the plot's a bit of a muddle, isn't it?
Some of those jokes
are awfully like the ones
we did so much better
hundreds of years ago
in The Lady Vanishes.
Also your villain is rather weak.
Well he's very weak, in fact.
But I think the big failure
is the relationship between
the heroine and the hero, you see.
Probably if you weren't so smitten
with your friend Whitfield Cook,
you'd be able to see that,
wouldn't you?
But then I suppose
women never really care to face the truth
when their hearts are involved, do they?
How would you know what really goes on
between a man and a woman?
My God, what a bloody mess.
- No!
- Ah!
More! More!
- No! Oh!
- Use some guts!
- Come on! No!
- Oh!
- More anger!
- Oh! Oh!
All right, cut!
Cut! Cut!
For God's sake!
Will someone get me
a proper stunt double?
Now give me the knife!
Not yet!
Ungovernable rage!
Homicidal violence!
Cut!
Cut and print!
We've got it.
Oh, not now, Ed.
It's really not the time.
You just can't keep this stuff
bottled up.
Oh, God! Hitch, Hitch, you all right?
- Can you hear me?
- Alma...
What if Bridget and Constantine
get into the cab at the same time?
Now what if they try and get in
at exactly the same time?
- Yes. What do you mean, "exactly"?
- Ie reach the door...
I mean they both reach for the cab door
at exactly the same time.
- They quickly touch.
- Yes.
We start on the hands,
we pan up to the eyes, and...
Oh, that feels better already.
- Are you going to get that?
- What?
Listen, I've told Peggy
you have to get this sequence
shot today.
What's the hold-up?
We tried it ten different ways
and it looks terrible.
No, it has to be a high angle.
You'll tip off the big surprise.
Just get the process shot.
How can he hold on to the camera frame
if he's waving his arms?
Why don't you just push all the gas
from the top of the stairs?
No one's going to get hurt.
What bloody idiots they are.
- What are you doing?
- No more phone calls.
- Oh, but...
- You're burning up.
Burning off our money,
that's what we're doing.
We're two days behind
and I'm stuck in this bloody bed.
- Where do you think you're going?
- I've got to go to the set.
- We can't lose another day.
- You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.
I'd hate to take you away from
your writing partner.
You stay under the blankets, Alfred.
- Mrs. Hitchcock.
- Good morning.
Where's Mr. Hitchcock?
Don't stop work because of me.
I'm only here as one of the two people
paying your salaries.
- What's the scene number?
- 173.
Storyboards?
All right. Put Martin in the chair.
Turn the camera around to face him.
We'll shoot the fall
against a rear screen.
And, Jack, that lens should be a 35mm.
Now, David,
you know how Paramount loves Jerry Lewis,
but this one is right up your alley,
and I would consider...
Barney?
Alma!
You know David Kirkpatrick.
- Hello.
- Hello.
He's working on Jerry Lewis
developing a new picture.
So he's free to help if you need.
That won't be necessary.
- But you're nearly three days behind.
- Yes. Well, we can manage.
Alma, we both know
what kind of film this is.
The smart thing to do would be
to help Hitch finish it.
Thank you for your concern, Barney.
But on a Hitchcock picture,
there is only one director.
No need to gawp.
You forgot to look in the bathroom.
A man like you missing
a vital clue like that...
What do you mean?
My mother always said
"If you want to do a job,
do it right."
Check the floor.
Closer.
You still think they're just
writing together?
What are you gonna do about it?
Oh, Mrs. Hitchcock.
I know Hitch isn't feeling very well,
so I got him a little something.
Oh, how kind. Thank you very much.
Candy corn.
Well, he's always been
very considerate of me.
I haven't always had that
from my directors.
Janet, I'd just like to say that
you've been very professional.
It hasn't gone unappreciated.
Thank you.
- Lovely seeing you.
- You, too.
May I turn it down?
Well you'll be pleased to know
that order has been restored.
And a "thank you" would be nice.
We're still two days behind
and $60,000 over budget.
Yes, well I'll cancel the wrap party.
That'll save us $2000 right there.
And you won't be tempted
by any champagne and cake.
Beware,
all men are potential murderers.
And for good reason.
All right, what's this all about?
Spending a lot of time at the beach?
Yes. Yes, it's where
Whit and I are writing.
He's rented a place.
Hardly the ideal situation
to avoid distractions.
Actually, it's very conducive to
creative collaboration.
I've already told you
that treatment is a waste of time.
Well, didn't they say
the same thing about Psycho?
Are you and Whit having an affair?
Oh, don't be absurd.
He's working on something new.
He just needs a little help, that's all.
Oh, what a coincidence.
I'm working on something new
and I could use a little help, too!
Well, what do you think
I've been doing?
Why are you spending all the hours
of day and night with that
talentless mummy's boy?
Because it's fun!
I am under extraordinary pressures
on this picture,
and the least you could do
is give me your full support.
Full support?
We've mortgaged our house.
Might I remind you
I have weighed in
on every aspect of this film so far,
as I have done on every film
you've made in the last three decades.
First time you show the film,
it will be my notes that you want.
I celebrate with you
when the reviews are good.
I cry for you when they are bad.
I host your parties and
I put up with those fantasy romances
with your leading ladies.
And when you're out
promoting this film around the world,
I will be there beside you,
or rather, slightly behind you,
smiling endlessly for the press
even though I'm ready to drop,
and being gracious to people who
look through me as if I were invisible
or elbow me aside because all they can see
is the great and glorious
genius Alfred Hitchcock!
And now, for the first time in years,
I dare to work on something that isn't
an Alfred Hitchcock production
and I'm met with
accusation and criticisms?
The work I am doing with Whit
gives me pleasure and purpose,
and it takes absolutely
nothing away from you.
Consider this a reminder:
I am your wife, Alma Reville.
Not one of those contract blondes
you badger
and torment with your
oh-so-specific directions.
Well...
I guess this is goodbye.
Why didn't you stay with me?
I would have made you
as big a star as Grace Kelly.
Well, unlike Grace Kelly,
I can pick my own dry cleaning.
I've got a family, Hitch. A home.
That blonde woman of mystery
you're always after?
She's a fantasy.
She doesn't exist.
There was a time when
I thought I understood you.
Understood women.
Alma, I thought you were coming
later this afternoon.
I thought you rented this place
so we could write.
I did.
You're not going to
say anything, are you?
Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.
I mean to Hitch.
Alma, we can't all be geniuses.
You're incredibly talented.
But, after all, we want him
to read the script with an open mind.
Don't we?
I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.
Sheriff, please, I'm worried.
Arbogast said he'd call
as soon as he spoke with Mrs. Bates.
That was yesterday evening.
- Norman isn't married.
- He said it was his mother.
Your detective saw Norman's mother
up at the motel?
In the upstairs window.
He rang me right after
she called out to him.
Missy, I think your detective
must be a few cups in.
Mrs. Bates died of strychnine poisoning
more than ten years ago.
- Are you sure?
- That body was...
This is my favorite place.
I just shut the door
and make the world go away.
Don't you ever get lonely out here?
I can always talk to my mother.
That's strange.
Jesus Christ.
I think we found his hiding place.
That's my mother's room.
That's my mother's room.
You can't go in there!
Don't go in my mother's room!
Hitch?
Hitch?
So what's the verdict?
Let's just say it was a four-letter review
and it wasn't "good."
Screw him.
It's too late for Paramount to back out,
no matter what Balaban says.
The other route is to re-cut it
as a two-parter for the TV series.
Because of the budget
and the Hitchcock name,
we stand a good chance
of breaking even.
Look, I made Jimmy Stewart
a millionaire on Winchester 73,
and that was a dog.
At least I could sit through
your picture.
More importantly, what does Alma think?
I was afraid you'd try to
blame yourself.
I'm not talking of blame.
Leigh, how can you make plans
if you're still not sure?
Whit must've enjoyed writing for Colbert.
How was the beach?
Cold and miserable.
Just like Barney Balaban's face.
Poor old Whit.
He isn't worth a damn
when he's not working with you.
Neither am I.
I couldn't pull off the picture this time.
It just sits there,
refusing to come to life.
I guess there's no other way of saying it,
is there?
It's stillborn.
I let you down, my love.
You deserve better.
Better go feed Geoffrey and Stanley.
Come on, boys.
I don't think I can stand us
both being maudlin.
That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation
I've been helping Whit finish is done.
You know there's only
one solution to all this.
That we get back to work together.
The fact is I rather like
living in this house.
So I suggest, for everyone's sake,
we start whipping Psycho into shape.
You may not be the easiest man
to live with,
but you know how to cut a picture
better than anyone else.
Except for you.
The second take.
The light is much better on the hands.
Only cut back to Janet
once the car's already moving.
Cut it tighter.
Ooh, you imp, you got nudity in there!
Her breasts were rather large.
It was a challenge not to show them.
You'll have to cut
those six or seven frames
where she blinks after
she's supposed to be dead.
Alma, we've viewed the film
a thousand times.
She does not blink.
- How's it going in there?
- Swimmingly.
Everyone's saying it's
like a dog with fleas.
No, absolutely not!
I do not want music
over the show murder scene.
But what Alma and I talked about
is really going to play.
Bernie, this is not Vertigo.
It's not a romantic movie.
The images must work on their own.
Yes, but you can't scare people
just by going, "Boo!"
All right, you do it then.
You know best.
- They have to anticipate it.
- You always know best, just do it!
Take a step back.
- What do you think?
- I think I'll never have a shower again.
- Hitch?
- It's getting there.
I distinctly saw both
the stabbing and the nudity.
What you think you're seeing is purely
informed by the power of suggestion.
I assure you once you
view the final version
with Mr. Herrmann's lovely,
lyrical score...
A lyrical score is not going to
change my opinion.
We're denying your seal.
Geoffrey, would you mind if we had a word
in private, please?
Thank you.
Now look here.
I have a modest proposal to make.
If you're willing to leave
the shower sequence as it is,
I will re-shoot the opening love scene
to your exact specifications.
In fact, I would welcome your
personal supervision on the set.
To my specifications?
But of course, my dear fellow.
If only audiences
could fully comprehend
how tirelessly you work
to help us entertain them
while protecting them
from filth and indecency.
He's been harassing you
since you announced this project,
you invite him to the set,
and he doesn't even show up?
What did you tell him?
That I respected him deeply.
Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap.
Thank you all very much.
- I thought we were re-shooting the scene.
- The charade is over.
Thank you.
See, I wasn't that much of a monster
to work with, was I?
Not at all.
I hope I was sufficiently loyal
to the cause.
Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear.
I hope you don't mind,
I told Mrs. Bates
she could use your dressing room.
No, that's splendid. Splendid.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
We have the seal
from the Shurlock Office.
So now,
we lead the lambs to the slaughter.
Paramount confirmed they're only
opening the movie in two theaters,
as we suspected.
And no premiere.
We don't get word of mouth, we're dead.
Then we'd better get started.
Peggy, take a memo.
We're going to write a manual
on how to sell Psycho.
"My first instruction to Theater Owners:
Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce
our unique admission policies."
There may be riots here tonight.
"Because is Psycho is
so terrifying and unique,
"the guards can help you deal
with customers who run amok.
"Post our special lobby clocks
"to remind audiences
of the starting times for Psycho.
The manager of this fine motion picture
theater has been advised
not to allow anyone to enter the theater
once Psycho begins.
Now, should you be so foolish as to
attempt to slip in by a side entrance,
a fire escape or through a skylight,
you will be ejected by brute force.
More playful, darling.
"To further emphasize the sheer,
unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho,
"right after the closing title "The End,"
"we strongly recommend
that you close your house
curtains over the screen
for a full 30 seconds.
"By doing so, the horror of Psycho
"will be indelibly etched
in the mind and heart of your audience.
Sincerely and emphatically,
Alfred Hitchcock."
Well at least there are some people here,
Hitch.
We've roped off some seats for you.
- You go on ahead.
- Are you sure?
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment. I'm
just going to check the print. You go on.
All right, darling.
We'll save you a seat, all right?
This way, Mr. Hitchcock.
Just got off the phone with Balaban.
He said congratulations. A well-deserved
triumph, as we always knew.
As we always knew, ha!
Does this mean I can
take the weekend off now?
Yes, dear. Thank you so much.
- Where's Alma?
- Go. Go on.
Alma, come here.
You know, darling, this could be the
biggest success of your career.
Our career.
Alma, I will never be able to find
a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.
I've waited thirty years
to hear you say that.
And that, my dear, is why they
call me the Master of Suspense.
And so, gentle viewers,
Psycho turned out to be
one of my greatest achievements,
and Alma and I got to keep the house
and the swimming pool.
But you know what they say in Hollywood:
You're only as good as your last picture.
So if you'll excuse me,
I had better toddle away
to begin the exhaustive search
for my next project.
Unfortunately, I find myself once again
quite bereft of any inspiration.
However, I do hope
something comes along soon.
Good evening.
