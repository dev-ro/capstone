Tell me when he comes
This can make you warm up
This is an unstable business
What's bothering you?
We're at the Government’s mercy.
We pay our taxes promptly.
Yet have no security.
Do you see that house?
When the American Occupation began...
...they told us
we could be protecting innocent women.
We borrowed money for this building.
Now they want to prohibit prostitution.
...though we haven't paid our debts
How unfair.
You're right. But the Government
can't ignore public opinion.
Listen. we're here for 4 generations.
Yoshiwara is 300 years old.
Does an unnecessary business last so long?
Hello! Had any luck?
Don't be silly. Officer.
I've quitted the rackets
I'm going straight. I'm a guide now.
Don't be so suspicious.
Madame, I've something to say to you.
What do you girls think of
the Anti-Prostitution Bill?
I'm for it.
You can afford to quit.
But what about the rest of us,
if this place is closed down?
That's easy.
The Government will build
dormitories and house you...
and give you jobs, too.
Then I can live
in a new apartment house.
I can be with my son then.
Because you're so young.
Times have changed.  In old days...
...many courtesans had great learning...
...and lived like princesses.
Morning, Mr. Taya's going out?
About the bill.
It keeps me busy.
Our Congresswomen come today
to inspect conditions here.
Make yourself at home.
Morning, Sir.
You're delivering now.
I can't afford help.
You like the girls too much.
Tell the girls not to
tackle men too openly today.
How much?
Any time's alright.
I will take the money.
Exactly 6000 yen.
Thanks very much.
Here's the money.
Aoki's payment?
Shiomi had a big business
with five workers.
Now look at him.
It's the fast life.
Yasumi, dear.
You've squeezed him almost dry.
Darling.
Thank you for the gift.
Don't thank me that way.
Here's some spending money.
Are you free tonight?
No, I'm awfully sorry.
My brother's illness is worse,
and I must see him.
In Ogikubo.
Buy some good food for him.
- I can't take it.
- You have to. Don't be so worried.
Thank you very much.
Don't tantalize me like that.
Answer me.
What? Your proposal.
How half-hearted.
I can't believe it.
Of course not.
You're the Dreamland's NO.1 girl.
While I’m just a clerk.
Don't be silly.
I mean, it's good to be true.
I've bought all the household articles.
All I need is your answer.
Marry me. Will you?
I will tell you the truth.
Girls like us are...
... bound by debts.
You’re in debt?
- Yes.
150000 yen.
I know you'd be disgusted with me...
...so I didn't tell you.
150000 yen...?
I'll get the money.
Darling, stay over.
I can't. I'm busy.
you're lying.
I'm so lonely without you.
Yasumi.
Could you lend me 200 yen?
I need powder.
Thank you.
I'll return it next payday with 10%.
Look, a real find.
A gold mine.
Wait here a moment.
I'm Venus.
Hey, brother. Drop in. I'm new here.
Don't! I work here!
Who's that?
That's terrible!
Mickey... Mickey!
This is the dame.
Pretty good, eh!
Give me a drink for finding her.
Where's she from?
Her old man's in business in Kobe.
A real stinker.
So she ran away from home.
And then went astray.
She was a GI's girl for a while.
In a year she became very hardboiled.
Stand up.
Cold, isn't it?
How's your husband?
As usual.
The flu is bad now. Look after him.
Tough to be married, too.
Your fellow makes clogs,
doesn't he?
Business is dull.
I haven't seen him lately.
if he knew you owed 120000 yen,
he'd never see you.
I envy you, Yumeko.
Your son's grown up.
Just a few more years of this.
I'm afraid it'll take much longer.
You get 40 percent here.
This is for you.
Sorry I'm late.
Don't mention it.
I'm used to it.
You aren't a rich lady on an outing.
I hate girls to live out.
Is this Dreamland?
Yes, Do you want to dream with me?
Does Sayo Kadowaki work here?
What's she to you?
My mother.
Did you say Kadowaki?
Are you Yumeko's son?
This is Yumeko's son.
Wait here a minute.
I'll call her.
Your son's out there.
I can't see him this way.
Send him away.
What's the matter with you?
Why feel ashamed?
You're here because of him.
He's grown up
thanks to your sacrifice.
He'd realize it if he saw you this way.
Why did he come to Tokyo?
Wanted spending money, maybe.
He's good-looking.
He looks more and more
like my late husband.
I must buy him a suit for the New Year.
I must work hard.
Don't be silly.
This is my private hotel.
Are you from Osaka?
I never expected to hear
a kasai accent here.
No, from Kobe.
Kobe's a seaport.
You're westernized.
I'm in Kobe 10 days each month.
What's your name?
Mikey.
Let's go to my room.
It's too early.
Let me rest for a while.
Still here?
I can't remember a worse year-end.
Go in. Better luck tomorrow.
I hope so. But I'll try a bit longer.
Be careful.
Thanks, see you tomorrow.
He cries too much.
Neighbors may object.
Be quiet, sonny.
Don't worry your dad so much.
Have you eaten?
Not yet. I didn't cook.
There's leftovers.
Let's eat something here.
Your cheeks are so flushed.
Fever again?
No wonder.
you haven't taken pill for some time.
Germs might have built up resistance.
...so it may be useless.
I'll get you some tomorrow.
Wasn't it around 1000 yen?
Don't worry.
I can do without it.
But that's all we can afford to do.
I can't send you
to a hospital or resort.
So let's do our best.
Remember Mrs. Yamada?
Her husband was fired with me in the
administrative reduction.
Oh, that good-looking woman.
She, too, has TB
and was in the sanatorium.
I hear she's dying.
You know Yumeko at my place?
Her son came to see her tonight.
She was so embarrassed.
Her son's quite good-looking.
Sonny will be like him soon.
Now that he's become so sweet.
We can't commit suicide, can we?
He says "mama" to me.
Soon we'll be glad we didn't kill ourselves.
I'm sure of it.
The soup is so nice.
"Anti-Prostitution Bill,
defeated often in recent years... "
...is expected to be introduced again.
"Lower house Judiciary Committee
summoned many persons today to hear their opinions. "
What poor holidays. Even Yasumi earned little.
Mickey's more in debt.
She works a lot but spends it all.
Welcome back.
How was the Diet session
Completely stupid!
I was in the gallery.
The opposition had the nerve
to call us inhuman!
They want to starve us.
That's politics.
What did Mr. Awai do?
He's a spineless fish.
We voted for him
for just such an emergency.
He forgot all his promises.
Isn't this material pretty?
6000 yen in 5 months and 1000 down.
Call the girls.
I'll keep it until you pay 1000 yen.
And you?
I'm broke.
I lent you yesterday, didn’t I?
Just 1000 yen.
You're here a month and
owe more than the others. Can you pay up?
I'll quit here then and pay up.
Now you're talking!
One more.
We must take care of our girls.
Are you all here?
I want to tell you something important.
That Anti-Prostitution Bill in the Diet.
The radio and paper say...
... it's a law to protect you girls, but they lie.
It's you who'll suffer.
If you had to go to jail for soliciting,
how could you live?
What will happen to you, Hanae?
Can you support your husband and child?
Will you just retire, Yumeko?
How can you continue to save money, Yasumi?
You'll work as a coolie, Yorie?
Mickey... What about you?
you understand now?
It's we owners
who are really protecting you.
We run these establishments so you won't starve...
... or commit suicide.
We make up
for the insufficient welfare policy.
We're social workers.
Human right. Welfare.
Professional politicians
don't understand your need at all.
We're the only friends you have.
Aren't the dietmen unreasonable?
Why can't we sell our own favors?
No griping madams.
Don't be taken in.
Remember what'll happen to you
if this trade is suppressed.
Don't pull a boner.
Understand?
Now work hard. Harry up and change.
A visitor for you. Mickey
Who it can be?
A client? In broad daylight.
Slim like a racehorse.
How about going to Atami with me?
You have a date with Yorie.
That homely dame? No!
Look, she's coming,
what are you going to do now?
Who's going with you?
Don't be mad!
Have a bath with me.
Bastard!
You are crazy! Bitch.
I'm a bitch? What are you?
Know our code?
Code? What's that?
Never heard of it.
You can steal money here.
But you can't steal a client.
A client?
All who come here are fools.
If he's yours, put a leash on him.
Sure. Mickey's right.
I'm ready to face anything.
A man likes to buy a fresh fish
rather than an old one.
It's up to him who buys.
Look at the mirror.
What happened?
Let's eat cakes,
we three wallflowers.
Madam is angry
because business is bad.
Don't be too mad at Mickey.
She's not to blame.
It's not that.
I'm fed up with this work.
A country girl like me
gets no break at all.
And debts keep piling up.
How wretched I feel.
I wish I could walk out of here
and marry my guy.
Look at these.
What?
Opening a shop?
I console myself by dreaming of the day
I may marry him.
Do you really want to get married?
Then, for Heaven's sake. Go ahead.
Read this.
The court decided
that debts of girls like us are void.
So if you quit, you needn't pay back.
The owners can't collect.
Really?
Sure. Pack your things tonight.
Everything.
And take them to my place.
A bright idea!
That stingy Madam needs a lesson.
Won't it get you girls in trouble later?
We'll worry about it then.
There's something to celebrate.
What's good about marriage?
Nothing. Just a long-term contract.
That's all.
I'm so glad... of your decision.
Stick to it.
I'm so happy for you.
Only the scum of the earth
work there long.
Remember. Be a good wife...
... and be good to your husband.
Don't go back no matter what happens.
Yes, you can.
Come back
if it doesn't work out
Don't talk rot. Never come back.
Yorie...
Here's my wedding gift.
It's a travel coupon.
Use it when you're through with him.
Forget it. She doesn't mean it.
My present.
A set of rice bowls.
This is from me.
Decent people rise early.
Don't oversleep.
This is my present.
A bankbook with a 500 yen deposit.
Try to save money like Yasumi does.
How do I thank you guys.
What nice bowls!
You're brighter than I thought.
After my husband died,
his rice bowl reminded me of him.
We were married at the Manchurian
Railway Club at Mutanchiang.
I still remember the lady
who gave us one like this.
Thanks very much.
It was 20 years ago.
This is the happiest moment of my life.
I hate to leave you. It's hard.
I envy you.
I was happy, too, once.
I'm longing to see my son.
The taxi is coming, come on.
Good luck!
Give my regards to your husband.
How long will it last?
I really hate the country.
An hour till the next bus.
Give me a bowl of needles, will you?
Could I use your mirror?
What village are you going to?
Don't ask me that.
I'll stop by when I return.
You can wipe off your rouge...
...but not the makeup of your trade.
Good evening.
Forgive my long absence.
How's Father?
He's still bedridden.
I'm sorry to trouble you,
when You're only my son's wife.
Come on in.
You're lucky to be always well.
Is Shuichi getting along all right?
He's better off working in Tokyo
than hiding here.
I hear the toy factory pays well.
You mean he isn't here?
Didn't he go to see you?
When did he leave?
It's almost a month.
He said he would
talk to you about his job.
He sent us a postcard
only the other day.
Where's the card?
There, In the drawer of his desk.
You're the owner of the factory?
I'm Shuichi Kadowaki's mother, sir.
He's working at your place.
Thanks for your kindness to him.
He's such an inexperienced boy.
And from the country, too.
Thank you so much, sir.
Do come again, dear.
The office is busy now
after the holidays
I don't believe this.
Someone must be jealous.
No fooling. I lost my wife and
family in a air raid.
I'm a widower. It's a sad life.
I'm so sorry.
Let me give you wifely
service next time.
That would be nice.
See you next time!
Fool! Coward!
Why can't you understand?
The misery I'm going through.
It's no use. I'm not good enough...
...for you sacrifice.
Why have we struggled along?
We haven't stolen.
We haven't committed any crime!
But we couldn't live
unless I sold myself.
Still we can't buy milk regularly!
Is this our culture?
But I'll live on!
Nothing can stop me!
I'll live to witness...... the breakdown
of a prostitute! With my own eyes!
How terrible! Look at this!
The Diet and press keep denouncing us.
No customers... no girls, either.
Scared away.
How can we stand an 11 o'clock curfew?
Why are you girls so lazy?
This is for you, Yasumi.
The tops. Others get little.
Yumeko, why don’t' you work harder,
if you remit to your son?
Nothing for you, Mickey.
Only more debts.
Hello, when did you come?
I'm sorry I'm late.
What's wrong?
Five days pay for you. 1,200 yen.
You can't pay the loan again.
Please don't become too haggard.
You are for sale.
I'll be more careful.
You owe me 1,500 yen. Remember?
I'm flat broke.
Then I'll take this ring.
It cost me 1,000 yen.
I made 500 yen. Thanks.
Your travel expenses -
2,000 yen.
I'm sorry, but can you wait for the rest?
I have 200 yen left. Please.
I'm fed up with your excuses.
Let me pay you for the medicine
before I'm asked.
Let me lend you more.
50 yen interest?
The boss in?
He is.
Mr. Nomura of the Association.
I won't see any more
M.P.'s or reporters.
The quilt maker skipped town last night.
Many people got gypped.
I lent him 30,000 yen.
Good morning.
Who is she?
That girl?
A typist in the Documents Section.
A smart dresser.
Her father owns a restaurant.
What's her name?
Do you need to know that?
Yasu - Miss Yasuhara.
I'll say hello to her.
Good afternoon. Miss Yasuhara.
I'm Mrs. Kaneda.
Thank you for your kind assistance
to my husband.
Not at all.
I'm indebted to the Chief for his kindness.
You are so kind.
Here you are.
Thank you so much, darling.
I won't ever forget your kindness.
I'm very lucky to have a man life you?
When can you quit? I'm ready now.
What shall I do?
I haven't the nerve.
What is it? Not more debts?
I left the hospital only two days ago.
Since then I've had kidney trouble.
Hospital!
More debts! I just earn wages.
150,000 yen is a big sum to me.
That's all I can raise.
I haven't been working.
Please come, dear.
Mad at me?
Very well.
I can't ask you for more.
I've asked too much already.
How much do you need?
100,000 yen.
Charge it.
Mickey, you owe 1,600 yen already.
I know.
Stop in after you close.
I'll pay in trade.
Goodness! Yorie! What happened?
You've lost weight.
It was terrible.
Quarrel with him?
Back already! Too quick.
It was just a wild dream.
I found out quickly
He didn't want me.
He wanted a hired hand without paying.
I had to help him
from morning till midnight.
Cook and wash besides.
No maid would do that.
And be a wife, too.
But you married him.
Didn't you realize that from the start.
What a fool!
I was a fool. He's so poor.
He slaves for nothing.
Can't even buy a kimono.
I began to think of returning
because here I can spend what I earn.
Once this becomes a habit...
... you can't quit easily.
I tried to get a decent job.
I tried hard. The pay's so small.
5,000 yen a month.
Yes, I went to an employment agency.
They told me I could
get 15,000 yen a month only here.
That's true.
I'll talk to the Madame for you.
Yasumi,
This month's interest from the shop.
They didn't want to pay.
Goodness, so much money.
Don't touch it.
That isn't a safe place.
Put it in here.
Sleep with it till you deposit it
in the morning.
Is this all yours?
And I'm always hard up.
They call you a loan shark around here?
Let them talk.
It's amazing a girl of your age
is so money-minded.
It's not amazing.
I came here to raise bail
for my father...
...who was sent to prison.
For only 200,000 yen
my life was ruined!
Just for money!
I hate poverty!
I curse it!
What is it? Lunch?
I'll eat later.
It isn't lunch.
Eikoh brought you a client.
What a busy day!
Two fools before lunch.
Papa.
You came for me?
Bad news travels quickly.
People back home know you're here.
Pack your things.
We are leaving.
Only you worried your mother.
Is she angry at me?
She's dead.
What? What did you say?
She died last spring.
She took her regrets into the grave.
Mama's dead.
Her father?
Figure up her debts
and add 10% a month.
I did no wrong.
Mickey's no kid.
I didn't kidnap her.
No father can snatch our girls
when they're so scarce.
He can't settle up just with money.
70,200 yen in all.
Michiko,
I came to you because of your sister.
One of my customers
has a good match for her.
He might overlook a delinquent.
But not a girl living in the Yoshiwara.
Your older brother
graduated college with honors.
He can't get a Government job
because of you.
Is that so?
So I must come home?
That's right.
We're an old family in Kobe.
My trading company's very successful.
People talk. But if you return,
everything will be all right.
Besides, I married again recently.
You married again?
And Mama not dead a year?
Who's she?
That geisha from Kyoto?
Or your Osaka girl?
Which of your mistresses,
did you pick?
You don't understand.
A wife is the axis of a household.
A household without a wife
isn't trusted by the public.
Axis of a household!
Business won't prosper without one!
Why didn't you treat Mama more kindly?
She always cried
over your infidelity.
Why didn't you reform
while she was alive?
Remember I appealed with tears?
Why try to put up a good front now?
I'm only following your example.
You've been having a good time.
You have no right to stop me.
Takako cant' remain a spinster forever!
You're to blame!
Now it's your turn to suffer!
I want you to suffer.
You'll understand how Mama felt.
Why so paternal suddenly?
You must've come to Yoshiwara
a few times before.
Don't make such a face.
Why don't you try me?
1,500 yen.
The last word in debauchery!
Not interested?
Really?
Then get out!
At once!
I won't leave... I'll stay here.
If I must I'll go to Mama!
What an unpleasant melodrama.
I need some diversion.
Yes, this is Dreamland.
One moment, please
Yumeko, a call for you.
A young man.
Really?
It's Yumeko speaking.
Come here tonight,
let's be happy.
Shuichi? You're Shuichi?
Why do you keep calling me?
Don't phone again.
Don't talk to me like that!
Why did you come to Tokyo
without telling me?
I must see you.
Where are you now?
I must speak to you.
I can't talk here.
Please see me.
I'll come to you. Will you?
All right, all right.
I'll see you.
Tomorrow at three. Outside the factory.
My son just phoned me.
He wants to see me.
Probably wants to live with me.
Isn't it wonderful to have a son?
Mama! Here I am, Mama.
My son! I'm so glad to see you.
I was worried that you wouldn't come.
I was shocked at Grandpa's
to find you gone.
I'm so glad you want to work.
I have to make a living.
Yes, of course.
How grown up you are.
Is the work interesting?
How much do you make?
Not much to start.
But I can support myself.
I'm studying to become an electrician.
I'm glad you're so ambitious.
Can we live together?
I'm earning very little now.
The future looks dark.
I'm no longer young.
I don't want you phoning the factory.
Why? When I call,
I say I'm your mother.
The factory people talk kindly to me.
Everyone knows
what you're doing back home.
I was too ashamed! So I left.
You don't blame me?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
How dare you!
I did it to bring you up.
It was your duty as a parent.
I'll soon have to quit.
A law is being passed.
What will I do then?
I must turn to you.
I've looked forward to the day
we could live together.
Please don't be mad at me.
I want no part of you.
I don't want to see you.
Never think of me as your son.
How can you be so cruel?
I hate you!
Mickey's treating. Eat it.
She is out of her mind
since her son disowned her.
What a terrible son!
Everyone's selfish.
When it's convenient
they call themselves parents or children.
When inconvenient
there's no telling what they'll say.
Only fool feels sad.
Go ahead, eat.
Go ahead.
It's good!
Never eaten anything so good!
Where are you from?
Kyushu.
Why did you come here?
My father was a miner,
He had an accident.
He's bedridden now.
Poor thing.
She's too young for this.
We're all alike.
I was once sold for 2,000 yen.
Where's Yumeko?
I've missed you. What's wrong?
Hysterics again?
Okay. I'll cure you.
I've been in the mountains for weeks.
Aren't you glad to see me?
I have plenty of money.
I'm Mrs. Osamu Kadowaki.
Shuichi, Shuichi.
Shuichi, come back,
I'm waiting for you.
She's gone crazy.
Get a doctor.
What's up?
Nothing.
Paid your debts?
Completely. Good.
Let's leave, Hurry.
So hurry?
I've bought tickets for Beppu Spa.
You'll like it.
Mr. Aoki...
You won't be happy marrying me.
I've been here too long.
You're sure to regret it.
I'm not such a fool.
I’m sorry, I won't go.
You've tricked me.
I got the money
because you promised to marry me.
I asked you for the money...
...because I wanted to quit here.
It's foolish to argue
with us about money.
You never intended to marry me!
Go ahead. Beat me.
Aren't you a salesman?
You sell your goods.
I sell my body.
Both business deals.
Don't cry
if you lose a little money.
That money belonged to my firm.
I wanted to marry you so badly
I stole it!
I chose Beppu spa
to hide from the police!
Come with me, please.
I wouldn't have taken it
if I'd known that.
What?
Then give it back, You must!
If you really love me,
why not give it up with good grace.
I can still return it.
I can't lose the money
and you both.
That's enough?
I hate a weakling
Don't come here again!
She's dead.
Call the police.
I'll be away for awhile.
Come and see me.
A lunatic and a near murder.
What a day!
Close up for the night.
"Anti-Prostitution Bill was shelved again. Review
of the controversial bill came to its final phase... "
"and the Judiciary Committee met today - - "
Give Yasumi a rest.
She'll be able to work tomorrow.
Thanks, doctor.
Has Yumeko gone to the asylum?
She wanted an apartment, not a cell.
We'll look for him.
"Thus the Anti-Prostitution Bill
was killed once again... "
"... to the disappointment
of all its proponents - -"
I knew it. Killed again.
The public wouldn't allow it.
Give me a drink.
Buy some eats for the girls.
Didn't I tell you, girls?
Now you can support your sick husband
and baby, Hanae.
You needn't become a coolie, Yorie.
If you need money, Mickey, say so.
We make up the inadequacy
of the Government's welfare policy.
We're social workers in a way.
Those professional speech-makers
don't know your problems.
We're your friends!
Work hard, girls, beginning tomorrow.
One moment, Hanae.
Didn't I tell you not to come here?
The landlord evicted us.
We must sleep outdoors.
But sonny may catch cold.
Don't talk so sad.
All right.
I'll wait for you in the park.
Wait here.
We'll go together.
I'll ask the Madam to lend me rent money.
Good morning, sir.
Thank you for the flowers.
Not at all.
You have a large stock.
Congratulations.
Your success does you credit.
Those women reformers should see this.
I want something more colorful.
This kind?
It doesn't appeal to me.
She must look pretty at her debut.
Good morning, Madam.
Thanks for the flowers.
How's the business?
I think I'll manage.
Thanks for your orders.
Cushions and pajamas.
How much? Any discount?
Of course! 7,000 yen.
You may pay later.
We just opened today.
Please patronize us for old time's sake.
We also loan money.
It beats me!
She ruined that quilt-man...
...and bought out the shop.
Ruined Aoki, too.
She won't die in peace,
deceiving so many men.
Deceive or be deceived.
Hers is the only way to get out of here.
She's smart.
That's Yumeko's
I wonder what she's doing!
Besides dreaming.
A young girl looks attractive
with makeup, eh?
You wear pretty clothes
and make money too.
Shizuko, You're no longer a kid.
You understand me.
I'm reluctant to let you do it.
It's your mama.
She writes me often asking for money.
I'm sure she needs it badly.
We decided on this...
...much against our wishes.
We hate to start girls.
You want it?
I can't be helped.
Don't let it throw you.
Many do it for foolish men for nothing.
Watch me. And go to it.
