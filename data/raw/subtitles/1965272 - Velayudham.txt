You damn English man!
You've to accept our demands
...or else we will have to
kill them one by one
You have made our men to suffer very much
Ulaganathan! Tamil Nadu Home minister!
Do you know why you have been called here?
To spoil the peace of Indian citizens
To spoil the peace of Indian citizens
We've done enough bombings in...
...Delhi and Bombay in the North
to threaten the nation
Our next target to show our
full strength in bombing in South...
...is Chennai, the most important city,
where nobody can expect
I know it! You have brought me here
as I am the right person to do all this
I'm sure you can't find a nasty guy
like me in the whole Tamil Nadu
Nilagiri is full of Ganja estates!
In 4 factories they do
the adulteration work
By eliminating the former home minister
...I became the home minister
it'll be our rule next year
As you have said,
I want my bank balance of 5 billions
...to become 50 billions
Tell me what should I do for that
There should be bomb blasts
simultaneously in Chennai at various places
The entire India should tremble from fear
seeing the end of Chennai caused by us
That's it! We'll change
Tamil Nadu into a graveyard!
Holy war...!
CHENNAI
Jasmine flowers is 10 rupees per yard

- Be careful!
- Okay!
Give me a kiss
Sir! Brother shines well
in acting, isn't it?
The Home Minister Ulaganathan rushed
to the site where the tragedy occurred
I feel very happy to see that
You have done a great job
Though it is a new kind of work,
they've done it the right way
This is only the beginning
We have to do a lot of work now on
We can make it grand brother
The terrorist attacks
were only in the North India till now
The attacks have spread in Tamil Nadu too
What are you looking there?
Look here
These were taken on the spot,
at close distance!
If shown these the dailies
will rush up after these!
- What Bharathi?
- Ls it for this Ragav
...we are working freelance
after throwing our jobs?
Until he boarded the flight her father
was compelling her to go with him
...saying that he would get her
a job in New York times
Didn't you see that today morning?
We've ignored all that, We should do
good with journalism
instead you give this more importance
What do you say?
This too is journalism!
Do you want to publish
these photographs just as news?
Instead of just satisfying the readers
...we must attempt to offer a solution
to those affected in the problem
That's the success of the journalists!
We will prove that in our maiden project
This is a place not reached
by any media till now
We have to be very careful
- Keep the money and take material
- Ok brother
Drive them all out of here
Take her away! Come
Lift her away
Please leave me
My marriage is on the next month
Please leave me
- What are you looking at?
- Come, show it well
How's the item compared to the last one?
Why not? Bring those girls here
Where do you hide?
Sait, look at them
- How's she?
- The girl is good looking!
- The media people have entered
- Ls it the press media?
Not even their corpses should go out
Come Bharathi
Start the vehicle
Let us not go together
Show the Sky TV people what we shot
Hari and I will go
to the nearby police station
2 boys and a girl...
- Any identification...?
- I think they are press people
Tell me Bharathi
They have come to the police station
You have to be careful
- Oh God! They have come here
- You come out with the tape
Don't get caught
- Have you come out?
- I am on the way
We will be waiting near the roundabout
I'm scared Go fast
No, don't do that
it is his bike!
Bharathi, wait
Raghav has left us!
Bharathi, they've come... Come
- Come
- I can't
We have made a mistake
We tried to extinguish thinking it was fire
But they seem like a volcano
They can be confronted only in imagination
Go away! Don't get caught
by them and get destroyed
You are always in search of news
We can give you a superb news than this!
The day before yesterday
a bomb blasted in Gandhi Nagar
- We only had kept it there
- This is only the beginning
Another bomb will explode next Friday
There will be several blasts after that
You are dashed us without knowing about us
and who else are behind us
They are all big shots!
Go straight upwards and telecast
through satellite what has happened here
Throw away that burnt corpse also
There should not be any evidence at all
Another bomb will explode next Friday!
Then, there will be several blasts
in a row in Chennai
ls the news enough for you?
They can be confronted only in imagination
The news that I got now,
I won't leave it as a news matter
Warning!
I've killed the 3 people
who've killed the innocent people
...who blasted the bomb yesterday
I know that they will
blast a bomb on coming Friday
I will stop that too
As a weapon against the injustice forever...
VELAYUDHAM
Warning!
I've killed these 3 people
who've killed the innocent people
...by blasting the bomb yesterday
I know that they will
blast a bomb on coming Friday
I will stop that too VELAYUDHAM
A brave man has come to destroy those
who are doing atrocity
I have started the big work trusting you
Where did you do the mistake?
No one knows this matter
except those 4 guys
I don't know how he has written that
What is our next plan?
I am not afraid of the government
I won't get scared for this guy
Plant the bomb as per the plan
I'll see who comes to stop that
I can use sickle not only to
kill people but to reserve a seat too
Are you booking the seat?
You have booked the seat well
You sinner!
- Sister!
- Brother!
Come dear!
I have put the sickle in your seat
go and sit there
Dear!
If I touch her hand
my mood will get changed
I'll cover my hand
- I didn't touch you, did I?
- Why do you dash against me?
I am your fiancee Who else can touch you?
It is not enough that you alone feel it
it should be felt here also
Then you feel it clearly now
Go and sit there Go
- Move aside
- Come uncle
I won't touch the hand that
refused to touch my daughter
I am honest
Come aunty
Here, we are coming
Should I formally invite you?
- You come, give your hand
- Who is he?
Next?
Who are you?
You are not in the list
Are you teasing a Ticket checker?
I know Chinese Checker What are you?
It is me Why did you stop the train?
Why would we pull the chain
if you stop the train in our village?
You have stopped the train, isn't it?
Then give me penalty and ticket amount
- Money!?
- Don't you have money?
Then get down
How dare you ask him to get down?
Do you know who he is?
- Who is he?
- He is our king
- What?
- He is the lion of this village
He rules this village and our hearts
And he will rule this...
I am stopping because you said so
Even if he is the ruler...
...he can cross this village
only if he gets the ticket from me
Why should you talk to him?
Spread this towel
Put the money here
Come on
Take it Start the train
Beat the drums
Oh God!
The whole village has come to see him off
Is he a big man?
They are seeing him off
to get rid of his torture
What? Are they sending him out
from the village?
Yes! They were scared that he would
get down from the train for some reasons
What has he done?
Give me your hand I'll tell you
Beautiful village
Peace loving people
He didn't allow them to be like that
Valli, don't run
Valli, stop there
Opposition party people who compete against
me in the Elections need not hit with votes...
Oh God!
- Someone hit you with the red-brick
- This plot is planned by opposite party
Thank God! I support ruling party
Will you give me water or not?
You crazy! You don't allow me watching the TV
You wait and see
Someday I am going to break the TV
Oh God!
- A male voice in the bathroom!
- Lt is my fiance!
That's it Be obedient to him
Are you my uncle or...?
I am living with dignity
even if it is for 5 minutes
I've come to catch the hen
Dear! it's caught
come and catch it
- You move aside
- I'll move, come
You will move, isn't it?
- You will move, isn't it?
- Come
Catch me
You made me miss the chance
to catch that hen
There is no one at home
Prepare chicken curry
After eating that...
Only you are talking...
You have come when I am thinking about you
My time is good today
- Sorry brother! I missed the hen
- But my meat is dead here
Catch it
Sister!
Who is he?
Why is he hiding like this?
- He is my guest
- Ls this hospitality?
Why are you coming out from my home?
Where have you gone?
This lamp was not working I made it correct
Have you done it knowingly or unknowingly?
- I did knowingly
- Then take it inside
Krishna!
- What are you doing in
the poultry farm? - Valli!
Have you done all this for a hen?
No, for my sister
- For his sister!?
- Yes!
His sister has brought up the hen as pet
Did you get it?
I got it
Why are you getting shocked for this?
If brother and sister join together
it is not only danger for village
...but it will be a danger for the well also
I have given the milk to society
I have deposited the money
in the finance company
Why are you pouring the water on the floor?
Leave it man
if I tell, you won't believe that
First you tell me
There is gold in the well
- Really?
- I swear on my sister
There is gold in our well
- Velu is telling by swearing on
his sister - ls there gold in our well?
Come fast
Velu is very kind
Without keeping with him
He is sharing with whole village
Our seniors named our village as Pavunur
by knowing it is fountain of the gold
You are pouring milk to whole village
You shouldn't draw out the plain water
You go, we will take care of it
Don't talk Draw out the water quickly
Hey, it is gold Gold is glittering
Move aside See there
it is not gold
that is his bald-head
- Fool! Take him
- My dhoti
Hit him
Stop it
You crazy! Don't you feel ashamed?
If you do like this
When will you draw out the entire water?
Use pump set and draw the water
Come, let's catch the gold
before it goes somewhere
You too catch it
if you catch like this, how can we?
Catch it correctly
First you cover your bod
I'll take care of the gold
Don't break my head
I got it
Did you get the gold?
Where?
I got the sister's ring
You made me call the whole village
for this 200 Rupees ring
...and fooled the entire village!
This is my sentiment ring
This was the first thing that
my brother bought for me
I am really impressed by the
way you called whole village
Be prosperous!
Because of that beating, he returned
home only after 2 days in the dark
I haven't seen such a brother and
sister affection even in 'Pasa Malar'movie
Well said
Do you know what happened when they
went to watch the 'Pasa Malar' movie?
Brother!
What dear?
Take care of my sister
I should see happy tears only in her eyes
This scene is very touching!
I want to watch the scene once more
- Hey operator!
- Tell me
Play this scene once more
How can we watch the scene again and again?
Hey priest! Didn't you see
that porno movie 6 times?
Keep quiet and watch it
How can we watch the scene again and again?
Who is he?
That day you were stretching your leg
in this theatre and poking at...
Don't you feel ashamed?
Speak with respect I am Arbiter
You should've have thought
before doing that poking
Hey operator!
My sister wants to watch that scene
Play that scene
Take care of my sister
I should see happy tears only in her eyes
I am giving this entire reel to you
Please don't come to this theatre again
Oh God! He tortured you too much
Was there no one to admonish him?
The day also came for that
The lion of our village is going to
participate in the running race
He only gets the first prize every year
We should save our dignity
Somehow you must win
- That's it!
- Why do you talk like this?
I will save my village name
I will rock the competition
This year Vepampatti Mani is
going to take part in the competition
He will be a tough competitor for Velu
- So the competition will be a tough one
- How is it?
- First prize is teak wood cot and the cup...
- Come on! See this cot
if my fiance wins the first prize,
I'll kiss him publicly
- I will celebrate my wedding night in this
- Will you do it publicly?
I will kill you How dare you?
You are talking about kiss...
Will you kiss him on cheek?
No, I meant lip to lip
- Come, let's move
- Smart girl! She will excel!
- You are her dad, isn't it?
- No, I am uncle!
I am uncle for Velu
- You are uncle for only Velu,
or the entire world? - Get lost!

Our village competitor Velu

Third prize is grinder
Fourth prize is big vessel
Fifth prize is small vessel
Our Velu who is going to win...
Brother, I want second prize bureau only
Yes, I am sure!
What is it?
He is running backwards
He is rewinding the race
- Velu, move forward
- Dear, go forward
Why did you do like this?
It will be a shame for our village
Every year my brother runs
and gets first prizes for our village
Let him run and win the prize for my sake
- Move fast!
- You have some plan
You...! Run fast
Thank you, brother!
Brother, you are in 4th place
Run fast to 2nd place
Go fast!
You lost the first prize cot
Velu, we couldn't endure your mischief
if you repeat this, you might embarrass
our village in the forthcoming festival too
So, you both are banned from the festival
This is my judgment too
Arbitrator, please... don't change
the judgment
Didn't they come for the festival?
It is a big story
Why didn't you start the dance yet?
We are waiting for our Velu
We came here to enjoy your dance show
Come on, start the performance
You came to see our dance
But we came here to see Velu's dance
So, won't the festival start
until Velu comes?
We can celebrate the festival
But if Velu does not come,
the festival will be boring
Everyone can dance well
if Velu comes,
it will be a stunning performance
I know how to call our Velu
for festival celebration
Keep the loud speaker in south direction
The earth is trembling and
the sky is thundering...
We are the gold medalist in
Chennai Sangamam dance academy
We are the traditional dancers

We aren't siblings
Yet I love you all dearly
This mesmerising girl attracts
everyone with her charm
Here comes your lover to scoop you
You climbed over me and atop the palm tree

He has participated in the running race
and dance competition only for his sister
Why is he going to Chennai?
This is also for sake of his sister
You don't feel bad about
your brother after your marriage
Don't worry! I will take care of him
- Don't feel too much!
- No use even I feel for him
Careful!
What brother?
What is it, brother?
You have been worrying that
you haven't seen our mother's face
Look there!
Do you like the girl?
We've inquired about your family
to the villagers
Sister, we are caught
Let us search some other groom
Nobody told anything bad about you
Not blamed us?
How can we blame you?
You played pranks on us
But we couldn't see affectionate
sibs like you
Yes! Your parents passed away
when you were 8 years old
We know how you suffered and brought her up
You are a good example for our children
if you are ready, we will
perform the marriage in a grand way
Yes, it is our pleasure
to get such an alliance
if your parents are alive,
they will perform the marriage
But the entire village will get together
and perform this marriage
Don't worry about finance
I've deposited money in the finance company
for my sister's marriage
I got notice from the head office, in Chennai
to come and get back the money
That's why we're going
to Chennai with family
We've to do the purchase for marriage
- Come on!
- What's the problem?
I have been watching him so far
My sister is sitting in the seat...
- He is sitting opposite to her
- I got it!
- How dare you?
- How dare you ogle at her...?
Don't worry, Velu!
I've sent him to the 4th compartment
Did he ogle at our sister?
No, he didn't ogle But he may do that
- He may ogle...
- Move aside!
I locked him in the restroom
Idiot! I will beat you to pulp
- Dear, come here!
- What happened?
He is ogling at me!
Ask him why is he doing like this?
Did you ogle at her?
If you like her,
I will perform your marriage
No, I want a homely and silent girl
Go to graveyard,
you will get a girl to marry there
Nobody asks for a modest girl to marry
We get trouble in life
But he is a big torture
Have it dear!
Thank you for your affection We have food
What dinner?
My sister has prepared food
for us with affection
Sister's preparation?
- Come, let's jump out
- Don't jump out! You'll get injure
if we have your sister's preparation,
we will die
Yes, it will be little tasteless
I can eat more
But I couldn't taste
your sister's preparation
Yes, last time I gave your
sister's preparation to a dog
- Gave to the dog!?
- That is not important!
I've seen a man or woman vomiting
But first time I saw a dog vomiting that day
Please, don't compel us
You know I didn't listen when you
pleaded worse than this last time
So you must eat my sister's preparation
even if it is tasteless
- I should dine with a smiling face,
isn't it? - Of course
I can't put a Oscar winning performance
after eating your sister's preparation
Please, leave me
- Move fast!
- You won't leave me
- Don't escape!
- Brother, no!
- Have it!
- Oh God!
Enough!
Smile please!
It is my fate to have this food,
to perform your marriage
- Dad, I can't eat!
- Of course, me too
Your fiance is having the food
So you should eat this for him
Crazy girl!
I can consume even poison to marry him
But I couldn't eat this
Is it tasty?
How is it, brother?
You are an expert in cooking
We are the scapegoat
it will be better, if you had prepared
the tamarind rice without pulpy
Brother! This is not tamarind rice!
This is roasted rava (Rice flour) mix
- Roasted rava?
- Too bad!
You shouldn't mix tamarind in rice flour
Leave it! Is it tasty?
- Yes, very tasty and delicious
- See, how he tells a lie
Why don't you have it?
I don't like to have my preparation
even it is very tasty
My brother bought me Biriyani (meat rice)
in the last station
- When did you do that?
- I did it stealthily
- Dear!
- Have it
Why do you look very dull?
If I get married,
who will provide you a tasty food?
On that belief, still I am living
Why don't you understand that?
If the brother is a temple,
sister is a lamp!
- Sir, I am hungry!
- A beggar has come to save us
Let's give our food to him
- Uncle, what's happening?
- Offering food to beggars is virtuous
- Come on, give it!
- No, I won't give! it's very tasty
- Yes, I know that
- Have it!
Nobody offered me this much food
You will be prosperous
I will not forget you until I am alive
You'll show your gratitude
only if you are alive
Don't worry! I have one more box
I became a beggar thinking it is not risky
But this is too risky Move aside
Sister! You want to wash your hands
Come let's go
She didn't eat, but going to wash her hands
There are many ways to kill someone
But why did you give this food to kill me?
Come with me, I'll serve you
a tasty food in next compartment
He said he will serve a tasty food
Come let's go
it seems the beggar has praised
a lot about her preparation
if he had died, we would've
been arrested on murder charges
FRIDAY MORNING
Due to Velayudham's forewarning...
...that bombs will blast today
the city life has got affected highly
Temples, parks and beaches
seen normally with crowds are empty
Colleges and schools have
been declared a holiday
Our livelihood is affected for the day
- Will bombs explode today?
- No one knows anything
- Bombs should be present
- What are you saying?
Yes mom, bombs should be present
Velayudham should remove it
Then only those who planted bombs
would get scared of him totally
All the press people are here
For one bomb blast
they criticised us thoroughly
Did you take any steps
to sort out this problem?
I've given orders to tighten
the security in all corners of the city
I taught our profession
to all our 3 sons similarly
These 2 people work hard to steal
and increase our wealth
Our family got popularity
to stick wanted posts on us
But that 3rd son
hasn't come in a bit notice
BEWARE OF THIEVES
What do you lack?
You look like a king (Raja)
Definitely you'll rob millions of money
He is very alert
I've to throw this stealing bag
on my father's face
You always scold me that
I come empty handed
What will you tell today?
Truly this is an empty hand
People need not to be afraid
that bomb will blast today
Security has been tightened
everywhere in the city
Public are scared whether the bomb
will be blasted or not...
and they are waiting eagerly
for that Velayudham to come to remove it
- Brother! I forgot my bag in the train
- What is this, dear?
Uncle! You go and sit there with the luggage
I'll go and bring the bag
You go with them
Remove the bangles fast Biscuit works well
Sir! What are you doing here?
We are waking up the passengers
who are sleeping here
You seem like stealing
and not waking them up
You don't know who we are Leave the place
See! You too don't know who I am
Who are you man?
Are you a ****?
Come on, show me
I go fortussles quite normally
But you're insisting me now
Come on do it man
Go bash him
Come quietly Let's escape
- Biscuit!?
- No
At this age...
What is going on there?

Be careful
Hey! it is my bag
Oh god! He has seen me
You did such a great job Tell me your name

- Velayudham!?
Hey yellow shirt
Move aside
How did he get the bike?
Velayudham is going there Catch him
Thought I'll catch him and get promoted
but he makes me run like anything
How will you come through this way on bike?
As told earlier, Velayudham saved all of us
Did I run like an Olympic race
for a snack pack?
I can tackle anything with our brilliance
Run fast
Your snacks bag is here Come here
Where is he?
Has he escaped?
Will that thief go walking?
He has escaped already
Thank you very much
to save my bag and return it to me
Why do you chase so hard
for just a snack pack?
If there were samosa(edibles),
would you chase in helicopter?
As you think, this is not just a snacks bag
it contains 1 .5 million rupees
1 .5 million rupees!?
What are you saying?
I deposited 1.5 million rupees in chit fund
company for my sister's marriage
it's receipt is in this bag
I've to get that money
That's why I came to Chennai
- Anyhow I've to fool him and get that money
- Okay, I am leaving
if you go in your way
where can I come and search you?
For what?
Tomorrow you are going to
withdraw 1.5 million rupees
Chennai is not a calm place
as you think, it is full of thieves
Why are you looking at me?
Chennai is on that side, look there
it's okay! I've come with my family
Tomorrow I'll get the money
and leave this city
I am too telling the same
Stay with me until tomorrow
After getting the money
you can leave the city
- Don't compel me...
- Okay, go
I saved your bag and returned it to you
Still you don't believe me
Why are you looking at my face?
Won't you stay with me?
Okay, go crossing my dead body
- Okay, we'll stay with you
- Ls it?
What!? Bomb?
- In the station?
- Has the bomb got blasted?
How many people have died, leader?
Thank God! No one is dead
Velayudham saved all of them
if he hadn't done that
we would've lost our portfolios
- Did they catch Velayudham?
- They lost him
More important than that, we've to find
the culprits who planted the bombs
- Hurry up
- Okay leader
Having killed 3 rowdies who caused
for innocents' deaths
...in the recent bomb blast and
as written in his letter
...Velayudham, removed the next bomb
that was planted by the terrorists
...and saved many peoples lives
The bike was next to us
Velayudham took that far off and
saved us from danger
Though he was with us
we couldn't see his face
May God bless him
I only saw Velayudham in person
He went on that bike when I was there
Sir! Any militant group took
the responsibility for this bomb blast?
We are investigating
We got freedom for
our nation at midnight...
The super hero that Tamil Nadu
got at midnight is Velayudham
My grandpa has his two wives problem
He wishes to sell that house
Now you stay there Later I'll sell that
Why do you roll down
like coming out from cow's womb?
- How much it is?
- Rs 250

Why do you talk so deep for this?
You pay him

- We too can't stay here
- I am too
Will any human being stay here?
Ls this a house?
Is it Amazon forest?
It's a house, there are windows and doors
- There is no entertainment here
- Wastrels want entertainment

- Wait sir
Keep quiet, uncle
Whatever you tell they'll find faults
You don't worry
We'll go and find some other house
Go, go crossing my dead body
Why do you do like this often as in movies?
Then what? You made me pleasure
that you'll stay in my house
But if you leave suddenly I'll get tensed
When I see the actions you do...
...you remind me of
Bajanlal Sait of our village
- Assume me as him
- Still...
Don't bother about money
it'll go today and come tomorrow
- Won't you get your money
from chit fund tomorrow? - Yes
You go and take rest
You go! I'll take care of them
Tell me! What do you want?
This purse was full of money then
Now they've made it empty
Shall I ask you something?
My fiance doesn't mind me at all
He should circle me always
- Give me an idea for that
- Isn't he coming close to you?
You look like a idol made of butter
Your father is with black complexion,
a nose like broken chair...
...mouth like a cave and
face like demolished bungalow
if you're like him then he can avoid you
What is this background music?
He feels like dwarf Kamal in
'Appoorva Sahodargal' film
He is hearing us secretly
and walking on knees
Get up and go
Greetings bhai!
Sir! Your partner is coming
Don't let my partner know about this
Load it fast Close the door
Come and look here
it doesn't look like fake notes
it is perfect
Using my power I brought this till here
Using your business talent
try to make it double
King Dhasaratha used this seed mixer
to make love with his 62 thousand wives
I asked you to guard him
but not to smell this
You may drink it Go away
- Don't get angry, brother
- Take this - Give me
Go make him drink this milk
Then everything will happen as per the plan
- Dear! You are stuck with me today
- Dear! - What dad?
Is she going to hit the sixer now?
If you have self-respect,
you should commit suicide in this hall
...when I was mixing
that powder with milk
I am scolding you but you are smiling
as you got some award
- Do you have another powder pocket?
- For what?
Go man
Okay, go

- I am telling you, this is a dream
- Nothing like that

You've mesmerised this man
with your black magic

reading a news paper
You are cheating me
Your girl is very near to you
Are you going to give the judgment

I am not hurt it is a dream
Did I give the bowl to hit my face?
I wrote a name to make fear
in wrongdoers heart
But you've sent a real man
to eliminate that offenders
Who is that Velayudham?
I don't know
whether I could believe it or not
Listen Muruga! I won't change
my words now and then
I always stand on my words
My Katchi(party) should win
You mean what katchi?
It is my Thangatchi(Sister)
Her life should be happy
- The money that I saved for her...

Respected manager Mr. Udayappan

unexpectedly in a mishap

Few guys come to the temple for this!
Stop there
He is patting her back
like patting a bread fell in the soil
What are you doing?
Saffron coloured on your back

Will you pat if it is there?
You and I only know
that my hand touched there
But if you go out with that color design
the whole place will know
I'll kill you Go away
You are the best in everything

they take your bag along with them
Which actress are you going to book
for your shop's Ad this year?
I know everything it is a magnificent smile

Why are you sending them away?
He'll do a bigger purchase than all of them
- Is it nice?
- I don't like this colour

Yes, Today I saw her front without shirt
Henceforth you can't tell
that you've not seen her properly
- Don't you feel ashamed?
- No, it is very nice
That day you patted on my back,
today you came to the dressing room
- I did it by mistake! - I don't leave you
I'll call the cops and teach you a lesson
What mistake have I done?
Then look at my chest to avenge me
- Look at this carefully
- Crazy guy!
Ls what you saw and

The guy who went inside

How did this happen?
- Come on, tell me

- What is it sir?
With the bomb, Velayudham blasted
the godown that housed fake notes
Velayudham!?
Sir! The guy who saw Velayudham
is alive in the hospital
He is in critical condition
We couldn't get any information from him
His name is Velu
I told you that I met him in the Chit Fund
- Is it marriage for your sister?
- Yes, in 10 days
I don't know
whether I'll be alive or not till then
Don't tell like that
The pains that your father takes
to save you won't go futile
Did you see Velayudham?
How does he look like?
Come on, tell me! Who is he?
Come on, tell me! Who is he?
Damn it! He shows me Lord Murugan
instead of Velayudham
The world has born for me
Brother! Give me a strong tea
Why did you sit on my lap?
Go sit on my head
- I can't sit there, brother
- Get down
Wherever see it is written
about Velayudham will save!
- It is not about Palani Velayudham
- Raise volume

destroyed the fake notes along with rowdies
We don't know what will
happen the next moment
But he came at correct time
and saved our life
- He is the real hero
- He is the real man
- A special song for you...
- Brother!
My name is also Velayudham
Is it you Velayudham?
You've trembled when you see a dog
Everyone will mock at you,
if you say you are Velayudham
Move away!
Speed, when did you come?
I came when he was abusing you
- Why do you try this?
- Don't I have rights to utter my name?

Son, why don't you steal that and give it?
- Why don't you do this help for us?

Yes, you are right he was
slapping you with slippers
Don't feel for that! I'll help you
to take the diamond
Clear the place
- Dad, time up!
- Open it!
Why did you bring time bomb

This is not bomb,
He brought lunch for us from home
We will have food in lunch time
and do our work
The public who came to see the exhibition
didn't bring anything with them
Do you want lunch
who came to steal the diamonds?
- No, don't throw it!
- Why?
- Wafers will be crushed
- Won't you get reformed?
What is the price of this necklace?
What are you thinking?
I am thinking how to take out this diamond?
Take away like this

Police will shoot us

- Will cop shoot us?
Don't run, stop!

Are you standing here?
Sir, Velayudham is going Catch him
By mistake I jumped over you Go slow
- Velayudham is going...
- Velayudham!
Why do you jump like this?
- Velayudham is going...
- Velayudham!
Go slow!
It seems if I travel little more
I will reach my home town
- Are you from press?
- Have you come as a spy here?
No, don't come near me
Come on!
See how they are coming with force
because of your flaunting
Let me play with them and back soon
Someone is beating our guys Move fast
Come sir!
Velayudham planned well and made us
come here to catch them red handed
Is it you Velayudham?
Did you weave your magic on me
to bruise my heart repeatedly?
Did you come to kill me softly?
Did you come with a sweet reply?
Off my feet you swept me
Transfixed I watched wondrously
What did you do to me?
I asked you imploringly
Did you cast your spell on me
to hypnotise my heart repeatedly?
Did you come to kill me softly?
Did you come with an apt reply?
I transformed into a garden
my shy buds flowered laden
For elephant to eat
I was the green-feast!
Waves of love ashore
I tried to run even more
Tenderhooks, on hook's tip
I knotted my life not to slip
I fell a little distance away
electrified in a dizzy sway
Forgetting my name, in dismay
like a stone, very still I lay
Did you mesmerize me totally
to s(t)eal my heart deeply?
Did you come to kill me softly?
Did you come with the right reply?
Ms Beauty, diamond not beads of sweat
No word in Tamil to describe you as yet
Like durva grass your moustache
...that my teeth yearn
to nibble unabashed
When near you, even thorn
like a rose decides to reform!
Even mountains succumb
before you as tiny as an atom
You came here to arrest Velayudham
But he helped you to catch 5 terrorists
Still you are...
Please stop projecting Velayudham as a hero
We should find who is that antisocial
element working against terrorists
Get into the van!
Velayudham has come like a warrior
...and helped the cops to arrest
the terrorist and their arms go down
it will be a final warning
for the racketeers
Hello, I am here!
- What is the matter?
- I came to meet you
- Seems you are very simple
- I am always simple
Velayudham, how many bombs
did you find today?
How many public did you save today?
Don't play with me?
Go!
Why did you go to that place alone
and get caught?
I feel scared to involve in tussle
I've beaten them to pulp to save your life
- You are acting smart
- I am the king of my village...
I will make it grand and
win even it is a dance or fight
- 2 special tea
- Village?
It is an ordinary village
Such a wonderful place
I am facing many problems
after I've reached Chennai
When got down in Egmore railway station
someone snatched my sister's bag
Then what about bike?
Yes, I chased him on the bike
and got back the bag
I didn't know whose bike was that
Did you go to CIT Nagarfew days ago?
CIT Nagar! Yes!
Someone has lost his suitcase and gone
I handed over that to him in CIT Nagar
Then what about yesterday
who came to save me in horse?
I didn't drive that it drove me there
it was useful to save your life
How do you know all this?
Someone called Velayudham
is the hero of this city
Do you know that?
Yes, I've heard about him Did you meet him?
Today public are talking and praising
the hero of the city Velayudham
it's none other you, Velayudham
A special team from Central government
has been taken over the terrorists under
their custody who we caught them in the fort
What do you say?
Inspector Gnanasundaram
is going to handover them
We are helpless Nothing can be done
Home Minister is waiting Stop the vehicle
We are on the way to Airport to handover
the terrorist who we caught in the fort
He is our next leader
You should've committed suicide
when you were caught
- it is too late
- Don't shoot
The bike was near to us
He has saved everyone
throwing it to a long distance
Not only that day
Today I only saw him at first time
Those who are not scared of encounter
are scared of Velayudham
He is also a criminal
We will arrest him also
Velayudham is superb
if I think it's a miracle
You are going to change the peoples' destiny
who are living as it is fate
Why are you laughing?
Then? You are telling something
and talking high about me
I didn't come to achieve and
reform this country and save this people
Because of my sister's marriage...
I am an ordinary milk vendor in Pavunur
You are not an ordinary man
You are honest and brave
Good thing has happened
because of you without your knowledge...
...why don't you do
by knowing everything?
Why don't you change as Velayudham
for the people who believe you?
Hardly it's not completed 10 minutes
than my sister is calling me
- Tell me dear
- Where are you?
- Come fast
- I will come
I am her world and she is my world
if you tell anything else
I won't understand it
What did you tell me?
You can do anything to Tamil Nadu
being my driver
No one will question you
That day you said that
no one will question me
But he is asking questioning one by one
He has spoiled everything Who is he?
Without knowing Velayudham's address...
...thousands of people have sent the
letters to my office
Have you seen this?
They wrote this with blood
Don't you understand their agony?
Don't you worry about them
who are believing you?
In this world there is no adulteration
only in the belief
Without conscience some politician,
Educated people...
...rich people, saints, police,
doctors, and someone...
...they are playing with peoples' belief
You are also asking me to do the same thing
I am telling you to change as Velayudham
to make it real
They are many places
where wrong things happen
I can't destroy them to
by changing as Velayudham
Ten incarnations were not enough
for God Himself to destroy injustice
- How can I...?
- What do you want me to do?
You kill that Velayudham
I want Velayudham
You got 3 corpses to create a Velayudham...
...similarly find one more corpse
to destroy him
You make them believe that he is Velayudham
You finish the story
that was started by you
No fear when Velayudham is alive
Beat him he has only mud in his head
- Cauvery!
- Yes brother!
We have to go to our village Get ready
- Ok brother!
- Will our work get finished before that?
- It will finish
- Ok
Why should we need police
when Velayudham is doing everything?
He has killed 10 people against the law
as if helping all
What are you doing to catch Velayudham?
- We are tracing
- You can do nothing
You don't have qualification
to be the police
Why?
After studying up to 5th grade,
are you trying to rule us?
People like you are the reason
to get bad name for us
You have killed many people
to get Minister's post
But Velayudham killed 10 people
and saved 10,000 people
Do you want to catch him?
I have to beat you with slippers
Hey Feroz khan
Why are you silent?
We will catch him soon
- You have to involve fully
to catch Velayudham - Ok sir
- You can do anything
- Ok sir
I'll take care of your promotion
it is very important for us
to catch Velayudham than the police
I'll give you 5 millions who kills him
- Stop it
- This will not stop for your threatening
You are the only one
who has seen Velayudham
if you see him again
you have to inform us first
That's why we give Rs 0.5 millions
This is only advance
Why did you show the sickle for me?
If you give the currency I could show him
You got money, isn't it?
Show him
Is he going in front of me?
- Velayudham is going
- Where? - That red color shirt
Don't leave him Catch him
Who are you?
Why are you beating me?
- Hey, not him
- Not him?
When he has not beaten you
you should know he is not Velayudham
- Go and see that side
- You don't need to go any way
if I see him again I'll call you
They are beating someone
thinking that he is Velayudham
if any good people comes
they'll start to eliminate them
- He said he'll call me, let's move now
- Didn't you get any other shirt?
Velayudham will protect us
I've deposited my money believing you...
Go from here
I am telling you
Don't create the problem here
Leave this place Listen to me
- Give my money back
- Leave my leg
My daughter's condition is
very serious in the hospital
if you don't give the money she will die
- I beg you
- Leave my leg
- Sir
- Get up
- Sir
- Go away from here
- Sir
- Brother
He gave me this cheque
in your presence, didn't he?
I've deposited the cheque in the bank
but it has bounced
My daughter's condition is
very serious in the hospital
The investors are asking their money
What happened to our money?
This is a fraud company
They have swindled your money
You don't get your money back
Is this enough? Go man
We won't go from here
till we get back our money
I don't know what I can do
You have closed the company suddenly
I feel very bad
seeing at investors sufferings
Their curse will not leave us
if their curse had been true
I might have died long time ago
They are fools
They invested their money
when I offered more interest for their money
I will take care everything
What? Have you closed the finance company?
I bought this finance company
to earn some money and close it
I would have closed it before
I accepted for your deal
that you said you'll give me fake notes
In the mean time Velayudham entered
and burned all fake notes
I won't give a single paisa to anyone
Leave it How much will we get?
Approximately 10 billions
Who is it?
I'll give you 5 minutes
You should go from here
Else I'll take severe action upon you
Don't you listen to me?
Instead of giving security for us
you are sold and acting favour to someone?
Don't you feel ashamed?
How dare you speak against the police?
If we ask money
you're beating us by the police
Why do you do atrocity like this?
Stop Everything has gone
I have lost my life
My daughter is also going to die
Why should I be alive
after my daughter's death?
It's better if she dies as an orphan
than dying when her father is alive
No, don't do
I don't have guts to pyre you
Sir!
Brother!
You got the blame for his death
Government might not help us
And your police, Even God might not help us
But someone will come for us
Velayudham!
Our Velayudham will come
He will take revenge against
for the atrocities we suffered
it is said in our Quran that we'll
get the salary before our sweat get dry
I swear on Allah Velayudham will come
He will ask the accounts
for every paisa you cheated us
You may come with many guys
and having many weapons
But our Velayudham will destroy
all of you with single-handed
Vaigai express is ready
to leave for Madurai
At least tell me now,
why do you send us alone home?
It may get delay 2 or 3 days
to get the chit-fund money
Only one week remains for the marriage
You go and do the arrangements
- I'll be back soon
- Okay
You will come soon, isn't it?
Velayudham is not dead
Have you solved the problem?
Take care of the money
Sir, this is our fort
Even a bird can't enter into this beyond us
What happened?
A vulture has entered into our fort
- Vulture!?
- Velayudham has come
People have deposited their savings
in your company
...not for desiring
to get your 0.5% interest
Just a small belief to lead a happy life
Hard worker's sweat is more
powerful than the mother's milk
Why did you swindle their money?
If we feel thirsty
we can drink a glass of water
You are very greedy Have it
No, I didn't get a chance to see his face
But he made me to distribute the money
by myself and saved my dignity
if I hadn't got this money, I would've
committed suicide with my family
I called my brother to
tell that I've lost my money
But he didn't pick the call
But I don't know about this Velayudham
He has done a great job
This money is my 5 years savings
if I hadn't got this money,
my son would've worked with me in the quarry
I deposited my pension money
because it would be helpful in my end days
He should be prosperous
who got this money back
Operation got success
You can discharge her in 2 days
Thank you, doctor
if Velayudham hadn't got the money back,
I would've lost my brother's daughter
He should be prosperous
Velayudham, this magic word is the
talk of the entire Tamil Nadu
There is no history as getting back money
from the cheated finance company
First time, public got their savings back
with the help Velayudham
You are the only reason for their happiness
it's not me it is you
You changed this Velu as Velayudham
Not only me...
But my 2 friends also there
We had anger to stop the atrocity
but we don't have man power
We had enough courage
but we couldn't make a master plan
Not only this! The atrocity which
we tried to reveal the outer world
...it is still happening
I feel scared to tell this to you
Young girls are being kidnapped
and auctioned
There are girls who left their home
after fighting with their parents...
...and girls from orphanages and
girls who got cheated by their lovers
Small girls...
I've seen the death fear in the girl's eyes
...those who got kidnapped
Why are you crying?
Don't make noise
- Send them fast
- Go!
What is this?
Why did you bring the blind?
We couldn't even
get a good price for good girls
Am I doing the business
or running a ladies hostel?
Keep her aside I'll use her
Are you mad?
Why do you ask for a blind girl?
All girls get scared seeing my face
and spit on me
She is blind!
Let her think me for a while
- Come on!
- Leave me!
Leave her!
Please leave her
- Don't spoil her life
- Get lost
Leave me!
Why do you behave like a dog?
She is a blind girl
How arrogant you are!
- Sweetie!
- Leave me!
Leave me
Our brother Velayudham has come to save us
Show your mighty to him
Then if you are alive, do as you wish
We will stay here
Go inside!
Go, show your strength
Give it to me!
Beat him to pulp Thrash him
- Who are you?
- I am Velayudham
Everyone is eagerly waiting
to see your face
Though you're standing in front of my eyes
But I am not able to see your face
I feel very sad about my blindness today
Don't worry!
It is very beautiful to see the world
from our heart than the eyes
We were helpless
But Velayudham retrieved us
We are very thankful to Velayudham
who gave us a new life
it's not a big matter that he saved our lives
But he saved our dignity
I wonder how to thank him
Brother... brother!
- Tell me, sister! - When will you
return to our village, brother?
I will come soon
- What about marriage arrangements?
- It's going smooth
- ls anybody near you?
- Yes, Vaithegi
Give the phone to her
- Give it to me!
- I'll deliver the milk cane and come back
Tell me, dear!
I hope you will take care of her well!
That's why I am staying here
I'll take care of her
- Dear!
- Give it to me
How are you, brother?
Don't worry!
Here is a girl to take care of me
She is everything for me
- She gave a new meaning
for my life - Who is she?
I'll bring her with me
when I come to the village
Still a shoot full of tenderness
I crown you as Miss Universe
Okra-like slim fingers
Broad bean-like ears
Nose like a green chilly
Mustard nose-ring so tiny
Vegetable hot house are you, my princess?
Still a shoot full of tenderness
I crown you as Miss Universe
Okra-like slim fingers
Broad bean-like ears
Nose like a green chilly
Mustard nose-ring so tiny
Vegetable hot house are you, my princess?
You are fifteen only
tender mango, my lovely
My poor heart needs you for comfort!
Your eyes spear me fiercely
Your teasing touch seared me
With you within my sight
my days turn into night!
No holds barred your beauty is unmarred
In the skillet of your eyes
you deep-fry me to adrenalize
Without closing your eyelids
you send me arrows of Cupid's
Within 5 seconds you bury me
into my soul's dimple deeply
Treasure trove is your body
Seductively you entice me
You spoil me with your kisses
you tantalizing temptress!
Treasure trove is your body
Seductively you enrapture me
Kissing expert with panache Mr Moustache!
Still a shoot full of tenderness
I crown you as Miss Universe
Okra-like slim fingers
Broad bean-like ears
Your candy smile so addictive
Reaction to my touch explosive
Your eyes like a dark bee
Enticed, I fell into it willingly
Your nails scribbled over me
Creating love-scars on my body
To hear my satiated cry
my desire deepened to a high
In my dreams you haunt me
every night differently
Your dress disarrayed My life disarranged
I am defragmented!
Till I lose all my control
you plan to swallow me whole
Body-a-swiveling
Bangles-a-breaking
You take me body and soul
Mounted hollow Moderate tornado
Unending curves Planting hot kisses
Sweet nothings whispered
Amorous advances on bed
In spite of kith and kin
something struck within
Still a shoot full of tenderness
I crown you as Miss Universe
Okra-like slim fingers
Broad bean-like ears
Nose like a green chilly
Mustard nose-ring so tiny
Vegetable hot house are you, my princess?
A special show about super hero Velayudham
who gives belief to good people
...and he instilled fear to outlaws
instead of waging a war...
if they create economic fall that country
will struggle many years to revive
Velayudham has blocked fake notes
to stop our country's economic fall
My son wanted to start a hotel for long
Velayudham is the reason
for starting the hotel
Not only for me
You can't buy the happiness
even you give crores of money...
...you can see the happiness
who got help from him
Hence, whoever does a wrong thing...
if anybody thinks to do wrong thing
first you go out from here
Else our Velayudham
will kill everyone like a dog
Why did you leave me alone?
I begot only one son and you left me alone
Hence, this will happen to you
and those who believe you
Find out the bombs
wherever it is kept, will you?
I have planted the bomb in
three places in the city
if you can, take that
You have started the hotel
with the money given by him
- Now you are dead
- Put down the body
- Has his relatives come?
- His mom has come
I've planted bomb in three places
Krupa, see your mom
if you can take that bomb
Rascals
Mom!
- My baby!
- Mom
We should find the other two bombs
Please come with me
Where should I search?
School, hospital, beach,
temple or market where?
Do you want me to search everywhere?
Not bomb! I have to find out
who kept the bomb there
Velayudham? In which place?
I've caught Velayudham
that you were searching for
This time it will not miss
I have locked him
I don't want advance
Come with your boss with full amount
Come man
- Minister brother!
- Take your money
- Where is he?
- He is inside
Kill and chop him
Come boys
Why did you lock the door?
You are asking who is Velayudham
He asked me who was searching for him
I should show him What Velayudham?
Who? it is him
I wanted to know who has announced
to give 5 millions to kill him...
...that's why I took Rs 0.5 million
This money is nothing
compared to helping Velayudham
Where did you plant the other two bombs?
Don't lose your life Tell him
How dare you casually kill people?
Tell me
it is a lie that he has kept two more bombs
lbrahim is the reason for this
He has diverted you and police
that there are bombs in the city...
...and they are hijacking a train
As per our plan we will go to this factory
They are manufacturing dangerous
and poisonous chemicals
if this factory's chemical container blasts
30 to 40 villages will be destroyed
All new born babies will have defects
Security will be tighten in the factory
if we have to go inside the factory
we should go through goods track way
When this 1000 ton weight
train blasts and clashes...
...with that chemical container
at 200 km speed...
...it will be a pleasing sight to see
This will be a great achievement
in jihad group
Within few minutes Ameer and Sultan
will kill the next station master
if we cross that last station
we will get full control of this train
- Mom!
- All of you go to the last compartment
Go fast
Leave me
That route station master is not
responding to us to inform him
increase the speed
Bring the helicopter
I am searching for you
You are not searching for me
but the God of Death
How will I stop the train?
Pull that black wire
You the destroyer have no rights
to say God's name Allah
Do you know one thing?
You can't see a Hindu
who don't have a Muslim friend
You are going to spoil that
Come man
Sir, greetings
Velayudham asked me to hand over him to you
He said that this guy feel giddiness for
half an hour because of his beating
it will take some time for him
to get consciousness
That's why I caught him Take him
if you see Velayudham tell him that
I am also his fan among millions of fans
Ok sir
Brother has come
That's it
- Why are you dancing?
- No, we've some influence in our place
They won't listen to me adorn the garland
Move away
Do you need respect as you have come
just 3 days before the sister's marriage?
- This is for the groom
- Has the groom come?
Hold it for a minute
Give it to me, how long
will you hold this garland for me?
What groom?
How is your journey?
- Music arrangements are nice
- Come groom
When I see the crowd,
I think he will get more gift money
I'll steal the gift money
and get what I've lost
PUSHPATHOOR
The people in our place catch goat and hen
Will you catch this filth in your town?
Are you teasing me?
You damn it!
You are giving pose like Sivaji
to do this filthy work
Go man
I have to retrieve carefully
what I lose in this village

Didn't I tell you about my fiancee?
She doesn't know English Come
You sinner!
- Brother!
- See her tears!
- Uncle
- Tell me son-in-law

I've been telling for 7 days
that he'll stay in my house
But our leader

I won't bother where he stays
But I will arrange his food
- These decorations are mine,
how is it? - it is nice
Make the arrangements
Groom, come with me we will go to my home
Everyone likes you, isn't it?
How can I say thanks for this?

is taking care of me? - it is me
She is the one
- it is becoming as a big issue
- Correct
- I won't leave just like that
- You don't
Dear, she will stay in my home
We should take care of the person
who took care of you
Then I will also stay here
I have to do a lot of marriage works
Why do you leave me on the way
like a snapped slipper?
- Brother, come home
- Tell me, will they allow you in your home?
They will allow me We will sleep together
I can sleep out instead of
sleeping with you
Will you take me to do
that filthy work? Go man
- Sister!
- Brother!
- I have kept the auspicious sari
in this bureau - Okay
Money is in this bureau
I will take it and escape from here
Why were you waiting for so long?
Did you see me before hand?
You've kept the bureau opened
when money is inside
I am standing here for security
I know that thief
will search the money in bureau
That's why I have kept the
money on the bureau top
How is it?
What happened?
Wait, I will take that
if we take it ourselves fingers will be cut
I couldn't steal the money in day time
I can steal only at night
ls anybody there?
Come fast
What granny?
Why are you shouting?
What happened?
Oh God!
Why are you shouting?
I'll become a murderer
before I become a thief
What granny?
Why are they sleeping here
What happened granny?
I am blind
I called someone to accompany to toilet
Have I hit myself for this blind granny?
Bring the jeep
- Only one question!
- Stop
Believe what I tell you
I made him a driver to my brother
because of money
There is no connection
between this and my brother
How can I face him from now?
- I don't have any rights to live
- What are you doing?
Yesterday we got lbrahim
the leader of terrorism...
...in this situation
we are suspicious about him
...that he worked
with the minister as a driver...
As per his brother's statement police have
diverted to enquire Minister's brother
Velayudham has been praised
who caught the terrorist
Have you seen this?
He will be also a brave man
who he named my brother name
Cheeky girl!
She is gesturing him with her eyes
I'll pluck your eyes
See, what I am going to do?
Have you mesmerised my fiance
by wearing pant and shirt?
You are Bharathi But I am Rathi(Beauty)
Why these coconuts are small
for my sister's marriage?
Coconut will be small
even Ambani's sister gets married
Don't torture me
Dear, actually...
Superb! You have changed as a village girl
I like this
This is nice, isn't it?
I asked her to wear this
Who is she?
- Dear!
- Vaithegi!
What happened to you?
This is your uniform which you wore
in your 1st standard class, isn't it?
- Yes brother! it was that uniform
- Why you need this?
See her! How she is looking?
Learn from her, go and
change your dress, damn!
- Brother is on the line
- Tell me
I have told in the morning
what you asked me to tell
Everyone believed that
you're not involved in this matter, isn't it?
If you die, they would
believe whole heartedly
What brother?
Am I a thief? Or have I cheated
myself telling I am a thief?
Is it a daze or grief
or a confusion in mind?
Ls the life fearful?
Is it a daze or grief...
Stop it
Even Gemini Ganesan's conscience
irritates separately only
Are you irritating me in multiple images
because of technology development?
Go man
I'll show you that I am a thief
I became a thief
Hey agnate! He has stolen that money
You do one thing
you inform all our relatives
if thief has caught
they will inform the cops
Why do you inform your relatives?
- Super!
- Give your hand
Long live thief!
Did you know before that I am a thief?
I know! You are not fit to be a thief
You have to do
which work is suitable for you
- Have you understood?
- Why didn't you tell in 3rd reel itself?
The money that you stole by hard work
is yours that was kept ready to give you
...for spending us money in Chennai
Was I trying to steal my money?
No thief would've got insulted
like this in the whole of Asia
I have a doubt
You tell me often that
I remind you of Bajanlal sait
Can I see that sait?
Go! Put 10 paise and go
Else you will go crossing my corpse
Me!
I have suffered and worried
Hence, I have reformed
Bye sait
Are you sleeping peacefully
to mesmerize my fiance?
This is black magic egg
if I keep with you you'll forget my fiance
And my fiance will forget you
She must forget him
- Take that
- I have put many saris here
How does she look like?
At least tell about her complexion
Like her complexion
it matches you
Then it'll be suitable for her too
My fiancee Vaithegi
She thinks about me more than
she thinks about her mom
She loves me very much I too love her
You are an important person in my life
I wanted to gift this sari
to her through you...
...after my sister's marriage gets over...
...and I will propose to her
Before that I want to play with her a game
Nothing! You should act as
if you're my close friend
This will be the last game with her
before our marriage
Your fiance has bought this sari
for the one who he loves
That is not me as you think That is you
- Really?
- Yes!
Hence, you won't need black magic egg
Pardon me
- Sister-in-law!
- You too joined her, isn't it?
Then, can you marry my brother so easily?
- Dad!
- God bless you dear!
What is this?
You have told everything
when I thought to irritate her more
Dear!
Don't run
Stand there!
- Mom?
- Please come anybody
Let's see who will come here
You've your sister's wedding tomorrow
Do you expect a kiss now?
Be responsible
Bhai, I can release you now
CBI has enquired seriously
after my brother's arrest
- That is the problem
- Do what I say
Oh my blood relation
My dear sister...
You're close to my heart You're my soul too
You are my mom and dad too
I live only for you
Even if I am dead and buried
you can feel the aura of my presence
Oh my blood relation
There is no substitute for love
You're no less than God to me
I'll follow you like the clock's needle
Can't stay alive without you
even for a moment
Would fulfill whatever you wish
I'll dance to you tunes
Even if I am dead and buried
you can feel the aura of my presence
Wish to build a golden Taj Mahal for you
Would weave you a saree from the clouds
Nothing can match you presence
My only wish is to be your consort
Like the blue of the sky...
Like the dampness in the earth...
No one can separate our eternal bond
Bless the wedding saree
Don't move!
Stop! Put the gun down
Feroz Khan! Are you Muslim?
I am also Muslim
Are you trying to stop me?
I am struggling for the entire
Muslim community and welfare
- I am fighting for you too
- For what?
When compared with your country
Muslims live freely and safely in India
You couldn't even save Bin laden
who you wanted to live
But terrorist Kasab is still alive
in India whom we hate
For my beloved country...
I should arrest a Muslim terrorist like you
and handover to my government
I'll feel proud to be
a true Muslim only then
- You are going to lose your life as
an Indian - You can kill me easily
But you can't escape from death
Velayudham will destroy everyone
Don't you worry of dying alone
I have done all the arrangements
to send Velayudham with you
Entire town will accompany you
Just wait for them
if you promote me to his posting,
I will go up
Go!
I am dead now, isn't it?
You have to do the formalities
in your father's position
Boys are there to take care
of the arrangements
Come on, sit here
Sprinkle water on fire and worship
Brother! Hold this!
Who gave this to you
before the wedding gets over?
- Who gave this?
- One uncle gave that to me
Don't stare! Give it to her
it's getting late! I have to send
bride to change wedding saree
I won't allow you to escape
Are you trying to escape
after giving the gift?
- Come on!
- Let me go
I won't mind even you talk in Hindi!
You should have lunch and move
You came for Velu's sister marriage
You shouldn't go with empty stomach
I am telling I don't want food
why do you compel me?
What is the problem?
I don't know what
I compelled him to have the feast
...and he slapped me heavily
What are you doing here?
Come out with me
- Come out!
- No, I won't come - it's okay!
Come on, kill me!
Why do you stare?
Your house will blast in few minutes
Gift!
I gave you the gift of death
That day you have saved
lot of people from death
if you can save your family and villagers,
come on, go ahead
Still one more minute
Go, die with your family
Brother...!
Why he has kept his mobile here?
Is it my brother Velayudham?
Brother, don't come near
Brother, you go away
Oh my god!
What happened to you Cauvery?
Are you that Velayudham?
Are you alright?
Nothing should happen to you
I should be fortunate to be your sister
Now I am the sister of Velayudham
who saves the entire place
I don't want anything else than that
Cauvery! Dear!
If the bomb had burst inside,
the entire village would've destroyed
She has sacrificed her life
to save this village people
I am going to share you a good news
The terrorist lbrahim who came to destroy
our country has died in an accident
I'm going to produce Velayudham
before you all who caught him red handed
Welcome you all
Minister Ulaganathan has invited all
to see Velayudham live
The information is spreading like fire
We expect a lot of people
will come to see him
Not one or two...
Millions of people will
throng in to meet Velayudham
They will be very eager to meet him
You shouldn't take any action
till I order you
Long live Velayudham!
What is this, Velu?
Who are they going to meet?
They should be aware
who the real Velayudham is
You have destroyed everything
like my wealth, weapons etc...
But you gave a more powerful weapon
in my hand instead of all this
That is the title Velayudham
You only know I am a terrorist
I am Velayudham for others
I came to destroy the peace of this nation
People are talking with courage and belief
You are the one who gave courage
and belief to them
if you destroy that yourself,
that will be a big destruction
No one should believe that one will come
to help them and save from danger
You have tortured us very much
Who is that idiot attacking me from behind?
If you have guts, come before me
I am not a coward
- Do you abuse me as coward?
- Ls this distance enough?
Give the tape to me
Talk to our Managing director and
ask him to telecast this live in the channel
I'll go to the stadium and
reveal it to everyone
Take care of her
Now Velayudham whom
you are eagerly waiting to meet...
...is going to appear before you all
Don't lose your life
You should see how they are going
to die who have believed you a lot
Your Velayudham is going to
appear here within few seconds
Here he is...
Velayudham
Here is your Velayudham
I know you all like Velayudham
But just now I came to know
you are madly affectionate with me
I am very happy about this
What I have done so far is nothing big
But today you're going to get satisfied fully
as you have believed a lot
No, he is not Velayudham
I am sure he is not Velayudham
I know his voice very well
- He is not Velayudham
- Yes, I am not Velayudham
I am the terrorist Musafir lbrahim
I came here to destroy your Chennai
Velayudham has saved you all from death
But today your Velayudham
is going to die with you
Brother...!
Nobody can escape from here alive
I have planted bomb
in every nook of this stadium
if I operate this remote,
the whole stadium will be destroyed
- Die all of you!
- Don't be hasty!
Let's move to a long distance
and press button
Search where is the
video out of stadium's LCD screen?
Here is the LCD out
Don't do! We will die
Stop it! You all came here
to meet Velayudham, isn't it?
Someone has tried to cheat you
as Velayudham
But you have believed his words
and decided to lose your life
You have started to praise when you see me
You want me to dump your problems
and are trying to escape, isn't it?
I thought Velayudham is someone else
and searched everywhere
But finally I found
Velayudham is not someone
...the guts inside me
is the real Velayudham
if I am not trying to make you aware...
No use of trusting me
and my effort will be a waste one
Velayudham is a common thing
like the air we breathe
A girl explained this to me
She has fought against the enemies
even in the last moment
The guts she had is the meaning
for Velayudham
My sister has sacrificed her life
to save me and my village
The sacrifice which she did for us
is the meaning for Velayudham
Don't see my appearance and look
Try to give life for my emotions too
Once I was an ordinary milkman
When I realized myself
and proved guts is the only Velayudham
Can't you realize yourself?
We have food for our hunger
We sleep when we get tired
We enjoy our life
But when we are furious
and find some faults...
Why do we expect someone to fight for us?
No, we should fight for our rights
When we show our anger once
in 5 years the government changes
Show your fury often
the politics will change
He said I can defuse the bomb
if he plants in one place
Will many Velayudhams come to defuse bomb,
if he plants bombs in many places?
We have to prove them thousands of
Velayudham will come to save the nation
He is right
Thank God! Velayudham has saved us
and our country from the terrorists
Let me show his words in action
We both have same thinking and
working style for people's welfare
I have killed the home minister
and came in this posting
He is not coming...
Reduce the population
I have planned to increase my bank balance
But why did you interfere
and spoil my plan?
Everything is going to get destroyed today
This stadium is surrounded
with full of bombs
We will fly somewhere
and destroy this land through remote
See this! He is an enemy but
he was faithful to his nation
But he is a traitor who
betrays his own nation
I have killed our enemy
How are you going to punish him?
Hey, thrash him!
Get down!
