What are you doing, you fucks?
What do you call a lizard with no legs?
- What? - Fucked.
You just made that one up.
- Fuck off!
There's enough foam
here for a cappuccino.
Whatever I drink, turns into piss.
What about you lot?
Where are you going, Kizo?
What's with you? - What?
Just checking the fridge.
- Keep it down. - Shut the fuck up!
You'll wake them up.
- Quit bullshitting! - Fuck you!
What's up, Zoki? You okay?
Fuck!
- Bloody fish!
You fucking alcoholic.
What are you doing?
How can you puke in the street,
you stupid fuck!
Quiet! Or I'll call the police!
- Blow me, you old whore!
Fuck off, you stupid slut! - Let it
go, Kizo. Let's have a drink.
What's she complaining about?
Probably not getting any.
Come and get it, you fucking bitch!
Goddamn fucking Commies!
- Commies? What are you on about?
You scared? Think they aren't Commies?
- What Commies?
What do you think they were during the
war? Scared, you Serbian shit?
Show your faces if you dare, you fucks!
Dinamo! I'll die for you!
Give it to the, stick it to them!
Let's go dinamo!
All together now! Dinamo!
And now one for the Commies.
Sons of bitches!
Eat some more, dear. You've hardly
touched your food. - I can't.
Leave him be. If he was hungry, he'd eat.
He has to start making his own decisions.
- I'm pleased, he's not too skinny.
I've made a cheese cake, too.
- I can't, mum, I'm full.
Son, you have to find a job.
Leave him be, he's only just back.
- So what?
He's got to grab the opportunity.
You think Maric is waiting just for him?
You think they're waiting just for him?
The man deals with millions of euros
every day. - You got rich?
He's one of dad's very able friends.
Able? He bought the entire iron and
steel works, that's what!
Am I going to work at the iron and
steel plan? - He'll find you a job.
They went to school together in
Budasevo, so dad called him...
The richest entrepreneur there and
one of the fifty riches in Croatia.
Says so in the papers.
- So, he's a big fish, is he?
You have to go for it, if you don't,
someone else will get the job.
Make the most of it, comrade?
What does that mean?
Is he fucking around with me? - You should
go and see Maric while he still wants to.
You finished?
- No.
You know how it is, everyone's looking
to make a quick buck today.
Will you go and see him?
- Yes!
Let him eat in peace, Marinko.
We should've had this talk ages ago.
If we had, it wouldn't have come to this.
Don't cry over spilt milk.
You know how long people wait for
an interview with Maric?
Three months, and even then you're
not sure he'll see you.
There shouldn't be any problems, Filip
went to university. - Just two years.
Yes, but university is university.
I did some really nice needlepoint
while you were away. Want to see it?
Okay, just let me finish my cigarette.
- Give me a puff.
Good afternoon.
Filip!
Man, you haven't been around for a while!
- Hello, I just got back.
Is Dejo in? - He'll be here soon. When
was the last time I saw you?
I was abroad for a while, in Spain.
- In Spain? Spain is beautiful country!
As are the Spanish girls! Come in, I'll
make us some coffee.
When will Dejo be back? - Who cares about
that jerk! Have a coffee with me!
It's okay, I'll come back later. - What
are you saying, we'll have a brandy!
Come on, sit. Sit down a rest a while!
Dejo's back.
Want to go to town?
- What's wrong with you, what for?
To see progress in action.
How much Croatia has grown.
Zagreb is just like Toronto now.
I have to find a job.
My dad is on my back.
It's easy for you with a dad like yours.
A job?
Yes, a job. You think I can't get one?
- That's not what I meant, don't get mad.
I didn't know it had come to that.
You want a toke? - No.
- You sure? - Yes.
But I won't say no to a beer.
Want to go for a beer?
Sure.
You bough those socks in Spain, or what?
Fuck you, Dejo! You want a beer or not?
- Yes, let's go.
Let the dogs loose,
I'm in alcohol paradise!
Dinamo Zagreb!
Who cares!
Dinamo Zagreb!
What did you do there?
Prayed and jerked off.
The nuns weren't putting out any?
I'm glad you're back.
They didn't fuck you up
over there, didn't they?
Yes, a little bit.
They did a little bit.
She's as ugly as hell.
Give us two more beers, my beauty!
I'll have a small one.
Your turn.
- What, already?
You stupid alcoholic fuck!
You said it was my turn. - To pay the
round, not to fuck up my dart.
I thought it was a bit strange. - It sure
was when you're throwing twice in a row!
Krpa, cut the crap!
- Don't pretend you don't like it.
How did Dinamo play?
- What?
They won the match, right?
- What match?
The match against Rijeka. - Shut your
drunk mouth, we play Rijeka tomorrow.
No shit?
Got my dates mixed up.
- My ass.
Fucking hell!
Is that Filip?
- Fuck!
Look at him!
- Hey you bastard!
Hi, Kizo. - Fuck you, when did you
get back? - Today.
Don't fuck with me! Get over here!
You're looking good, Milica.
- He's put on weight.
Did you fuck any Spanish girls?
I'd fuck them all.
Dinamo!
- Shut the fuck up!
Handsome, another round and make
sure they're cold. My friend's back!
I'm not supposed to drink.
- Don't bullshit!
One beer won't kill you.
- He's scared shitless,
His old man wants him to get a job.
- You want to work at the local kiosk?
You going to the match tomorrow?
- I'm not going anywhere.
Let's go cheer! Dinamo!
- Don't bullshit!
Alright, chill.
- Look at this Serb,
if I didn't know you,
I'd crack your head in half.
I can't go to the match because I'm
Serbian. - Cut the crap.
The dinamo colours fit you
like an ass on a bucket!
That's a good one!
- You're cool, I was just kidding.
If anyone touched you, I'd give it to them.
- Right.
Where's the Deadman?
He's dead.
- What do you mean he's dead?
Like I said, beer's fine,
but not this shit.
Don't look at me,
I had nothing to do with it.
Listen to this, we called him Deadman,
but now he's a Rottenman
Shut up, Kizo!
To Deadman. - To the goddamn junkie!
- Cheers!
Hey, dad...
Listen, dad...
Hang on.
They're scrutinizing us
under a magnifying glass.
Wait until they get to agriculture and
the shipbuilding industry,
They have no idea what joining the
EU means, an iron fist is what we need.
How can you watch that shit?
- Shit?
Everything is shit to you, except discos
and sitting in a bar talking about nothing.
What if no one liked what you do?
- I'm just saying it's rubbish.
Really? Let me teach you
something, mister,
You're too good and smart to be
wasting your time like that.
You think that being expelled from school
because I said I was a Croat is rubbish?
Is that rubbish?
And our boys going to war, is that shit?
- Please, don't start that again.
You talk as if you achieved
god knows what in life.
Is it my fault that you don't know
what to do with yourselves?
You have us to thank for this country.
- What the fuck did you do?
Well, you didn't contribute to it.
And I don't want any more
swearing in this house!
I'm the only one that
can say 'fuck' in this house!
I have earned that prerogative!
You still have a lot of shit to take
before you even can get close to that!
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Well done, well done.
Talking to you is impossible.
- Because you always interrupt me.
I want to tell you something,
but you simply don't listen.
Your backside is spot-welded to that sofa.
And yours isn't?
Went off to that drug rehab clinic in
Spain. That's a good one!
A perfect entry for our family history.
Our family's sole international
success to date. - Enough!
This conversation is over!
If you don't contact Maric about the job,
don't bother coming home!
Thanks for the father-and-son
heart-to- heart.
Can I help you?
I'm here to see Mr. Maric.
Mr. Zlatko Maric?
- Yes, I have an appointment.
His secretary told me to come at ten.
- She told you?
Yes, so what?
- And you are?
Filip Marcijus.
She didn't tell you. - My father talked
to her and she told him...
One moment, please.
Stay where you are.
It's me.
Marcijus.
With a J.
What?
Is he on the list for this morning?
He isn't? Okay.
No, it's okay.
Are you okay? What happened?
What is this? Turn that off!
Turn it off!
You came in without saying a word.
You want a Communist salute?
- Enough of your lip!
We just want to know if you went to see
Maric. - Of course he didn't!
He spent the morning with his junkies.
- He went to see Maric, right?
Yes.
- You see?
What did he say?
- About what?
About the job! - He might take him on as
a trainee and then offer him something more.
He said he'd call me back.
He'll call back?
Did he send me his regards?
Yes, he sent his best regards
and said he'd contact me.
I told you it'll be fine.
- Of course it'll be fine,
we went to school together.
I'd like to rest now. - It's time for
lunch. - I'm not hungry, I'll eat later.
He'll sort you out, don't worry!
You just rest.
Milica, give me another beer.
Where's the rest of the gang?
- I have no idea.
And a cognac.
It's only three o'clock.
Have you eaten?
No, at least I have the time to get
drunk before lunch.
Gotcha, you motherfucker!
Now I've fucked up the papers.
The Magazin concert is on Friday.
- What?
The Magazin concert is on Friday.
- And?
Are we going? Jasna and Pero will go.
- I don't give a flying fuck about that!
Honestly!
- What?
You never take me anywhere.
- You got that right. So, what now?
Fine, I'll go alone.
Fuck you and Magazine, you're not
going anywhere, you understand?
Give me the food, I'm hungry.
I said I was hungry!
Playing up are you?
Protesting?
Don't go calling that faggot hotline
again or I'll kill you all, you get it?
Fuck it, it's mind over matter.
Fuck, it's hot!
Paper! There's no fucking toilet paper!
- Alright.
Fucking lazy bitch! Spends the day doing
nothing but scratching her pussy!
Making sure there's toilet paper
in here is not fucking rocket science!
What will you do now?
- Let go of me!
You goddamn bitch! Fuck!
What are you staring at? You've never
seen a dick before? Here you go!
Fucking bitch, wait until
I get my hands on you.
What the fuck are you looking at?
You want some more?
Goddamn fucking bitch!
What's up, Kizo! - Hey, Krpa.
- What are you doing?
The bitch won't put it on the tab, we
spent so much money there...
You're up for a beer?
A beer? - No, an orange juice! Yes,
a beer. - Of course, I'm thirsty...
I just have to place a bet first, I have
a great tips. - Did you bet on Tottenham?
I heard they're bound to win.
- They're not playing today.
I heard they are.
- Fuck you and Tottenham.
I'd bet on Tottenham...
Will you bet on Wolfsburg?
- Come on, Kizo...
They're in a good rhythm.
- What do you care who I'm betting on?
I'd bet on Wolfsburg...
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
- I think so, too.
Give me a bet for 500.
All fixed odds?
- You bet, I don't play safe.
Milan is the super bet. - Who they
playing against? - Tottenham.
Put me down for that, too.
Thanks for the tip, I owe you a drink.
It's your turn. Let's go, Kizo.
Did you bet on Wolfsburg?
Did you see how I smooth-talked her?
- Are we going for a beer?
You hear what I said? You saw her
reaction? - Yes.
She saw how I brushed off the tall guy.
- Are we going to Arena?
To look at that ugly bitch again? We're
going to town to check out the girls.
To town?
- Yes, why?
Dress decently for once, what's with
the cheap clothes?
Sorry, if I'd known we were going
to town I'd have dressed up.
Right, I should've warned you, you'd
dressed up if I did.
I would have put something else on.
You're an idiot, I swear.
Fucking A!
They're so fine. I'd do them all. - You're
acting as if you never saw a pussy before.
Well, they're fine. This one's good too.
- And size and age don't matter, right?
Look at this. Does anyone work in this
fucking town? - What do you mean?
It's 2 PM and they're all out in the
streets. You don't get that abroad.
Abroad? I don't  get it.
- Abroad in Europe.
You skiv off work and you're out.
Niggers, shinks and others will do the
same job for half the price.
Man, you're dressed like shit.
What's wrong with my clothes?
Nothing, it's just... You look like...
three morons.
I'm not out looking to get laid.
- Cut the crap, please.
If it weren't for me, you'd think
Milica was a prize catch.
You have no idea what girls I've fucked.
Photofolds and the like.
- Photofolds?
The ones that appear in the magazines.
- Photofolds!
You're crazy, Kizo, I swear! Photofolds!
You've earned a beer for this!
Watch out, you photofolds, here comes Kizo!
You look better like that. Now you look
like two morons. - Fuck off!
She passes as a photofold?
Look at those boobs bounce.
Not bad, right? - I'd fuck her anytime.
Ace her, bro!
Hey, give in a little!
Incoming!
Please leave the court,
this is a private property.
He's showing off to impress her. - I don't
know who would I fuck first, him or her.
I'd do her first. - Did you hear what I
said? Leave the court!
Bro, play tennis, just ignore us.
- Don't provoke me.
We're scared shitless now!
Sorry, mate, we'll stop.
Is he this aggressive with you too?
- Does he aces you from behind?
Marino, let's go.
- Marino? Damn...
He's named after a beach mattress.
- I won't say it again. Leave, now!
What is it, Ivanisevic?
You're shitting your pants?
No, get out!
Kizo, we have to leave.
- But we just got here.
Oh, you motherfucker! - Get out, you moron!
- Careful, or I just might ace you here,
on the grass!
Fucking hell!
Can we get two more beers here?
Good evening!
These are my war buddies,
Cookie and Zombie.
This is my friend from the hood, Krpa.
He's a legend.
Were you on the front line?
Yes, south of Zagreb.
- I fought in Slavonia and Bosnia.
South of Zagreb was a piece of
cake compared to that.
Drop the insults. We guys have to stick
together. - We're all Croats.
Give us two more beers.
What do you drink, Baldy?
What do you drink, I'm buying. - This is
our turf, you order a beer, you get a beer.
Everyone will buy a round and fuck it!
You were in Bosnia? - You heard of
Zloselo? - Where is that?
That's where I was fighting, while you
were milking cows near Zagreb.
Fighting? You raped,
plundered and destroyed Bosnia
and came back packed with VCRs.
- Take that back, motherfucker!
Take what back? - Take it back!
- Take my dick, you shit!
What did you say? - Blow me? - You want
your head bashed in? - Come on, guys...
You too! Goddamn fucking fagots!
Your unit was a pack of fagots!
Don't, they're my friends!
- You fucking piece of shit!
Call a round now, you faggot!
No one calls my round!
Fuck you all, I'm calling the police!
- What do you want, he got a free facelift!
He stuck you with the beer bottle!
Fuck you! I don't believe it!
I knew something like this was going to
happen. I can't even have a beer in peace.
Fuck your friends!
- Don't!
Cookie, I'm really sorry...
Fuck you, Zombie!
The Commies are still
in power in this city.
Beating up Commies is better than
a blow job from Sharon Stone.
That mother fucking faggot at the
gate isn't touching me.
Afterwards he'll go and jerk off.
I hear you got knifed. - No, I got
stuck with a beer bottle.
The moron started up about Bosnia,
so I told him to say it to my face.
I couldn't let it go.
Hey! Let him go!
Got back to Africa, you ape!
Go and pick cotton, nigger!
Fuck you and fuck your mother!
- This is Croatia, you ape!
Let's fuck with the toad?
- Give the monkey a banana!
Who are you showing that to? - Do that
when you don't have a police escort!
For the Homeland!
- Ready!
For the Homeland!
- Ready!
For the Homeland!
- Ready!
Son, did Pero pay you?
No, but he said he'd pay me later,
he has some problems now.
I told you that you had to ask them to
pay you for your work, you can't work
without being payed. I don't have the money
to support you. Money doesn't grow on trees.
It'll be okay.
When they pay him, he'll pay us.
Bingo?
- Hand me the papers.
Is there a film on?
Yes, Paths of Crime.
The one about DNA? - No, about a
girl who wants to be an agent.
Have you eaten?
- No, I'm off to the match.
I already told you
what I think about that.
What's the problem? Dad was a Dinamo
fan and so am I.
That's normal.
- Yes, and Dinamo raised his pension.
No one will even say
thanks for your support.
Hand me that pillow.
The red one?
- The yellow one, it's good for my back.
Davorka's son got beaten up so
bad that he's in the hospital.
You want that to happen to you?
- No worries.
First, I'm not that stupid.
And second, I have the guys behind me.
Got any small change
so I can buy a round?
You won't buy anything. Your dad was always
buying rounds and no one came to his funeral.
I just thought if there's some,
I could take it.
There's a sandwich for you in the kitchen.
I don't have the time to eat now,
so I'll take it and I'll eat it on the way.
Just don't get in trouble or end up in
hospital. - Don't you worry.
I'm off now, bye!
Tiger!
Where are you, Tiger?
Where are you going?
Did you hear me calling?
Who's a good kitty.
Go stretch your legs.
Here you go, Tiger. You want some meat?
Blackie, there's some for you, too.
There you go, Stef.
There's some here for you, Stankic.
There's enough for everyone.
Lola, come here.
What are you doing there?
What are you scared of?
It's not easy with all these
boys around, huh?
If anyone touches you, you tell me
and I'll beat the shit out of them.
Don't worry, come and eat.
Look what I brought you.
You want some schnitzel?
Hi, Milica, what's up?
- What do you mean?
You're going to the match?
- Yes, how do you know?
Give me a small one, the usual.
After I finish watching this.
No problem, I just thought you could
pour it while you watch.
I can't even put my
feet up for five minutes.
Pero just puked in the toilet and
I have to clean up after him.
I won't puke.
- You'd better not or I'll call the police.
You know I can take my booze.
- Yeah, right.
And my husband could take his booze, too.
Fuck you all together!
Give me a double,
so you don't have to get up.
One day you'll wake up and
your life will pass you by.
Look at you, what woman would want you?
You just drink, you fucking idiot!
There's a match on today.
Have a coffee, it's on me.
So you have to booze up if there's a match?
You wouldn't do that if you had kids.
You have a daughter, don't you?
Yes, two.
- Two?
They're in school now.
I've never seen them around here.
You think I'd bring them to a shit
hole like this? They're good girls.
God, I'm thirsty. Give me another
one while you're still here.
The match is about to start.
- Just a small one, not a double.
I can't go without my friends.
- You're waiting for someone?
I'm meeting up with Krpa and the gang.
I'm going with them.
It's going to be wild. Krpa is so fired up.
You're waiting for them?
They're my friends,
I can't go without them.
And you're waiting for them?
Your friends fucked you over.
- What do you mean?
They had a beer and they left.
They've pulled one on you.
No way, Krpa said we'd all meet here,
have a beer and go as a crew.
Kizo, don't fuck with me,
I told you they left.
Don't hand around here.
Get going, they're at the match.
They were here.
- Yes.
Did they say anything about me?
- Like what?
Did they leave a message?
- Do I look like a fucking secretary?
They left, you idiot! What else do
you want from me?
Nothing. - I don't have time for
your bullshit, you fucking jerks!
Fucking bitch!
Hello. - Why the hell is she
following me all the time?
Did I steal anything?
Is there any problems? - No.
Why is she acting like the CIA?
You think I'm a bum or something?
That I'd steal from a shit hole
like this? You fucking bitch!
Who do you think you are?
You're working for peanuts!
Do you have our bonus card?
- Fuck you and your bonus card!
Here he is, boss. - Is there a problem?
- You bet!
Calm down. - Fuck you, every time I come
here you always treat me like this! Why?
He was yelling at me. - No one
has complained about our girls.
Fuck you and your girls! I'm sick and
tired of this fucking shop!
Fuck me sideways if I ever come back
to this shit hole ever again!
Thank you and goodbye.
- Go fuck yourself, you fucking goat!
Where the fuck are we?
All I can see are hills.
It's a hilly country.
- It's like a jungle here.
Calm down, we'll ask for directions if we
get lost. - Ask who? A bear?
What's with you? Everything's okay.
- We have no idea where we are!
Calm the fuck down, man!
What's wrong with you?
You're making me nervous. - I'm not, but
we're lost and you don't even have a map.
I know the way, everything
is okay, calm down.
Where are you going? - Making a pit stop.
- What are you doing?
Now what?
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
You've got to be kidding!
- Take it easy.
I can't believe this. - Just a little bit.
- You smuggled that across the border?
So what?
I can't believe it!
- It was a trial run.
How will you smuggle a kilo in if you can't
smuggle this. - You could've told me, idiot!
Alright, I forgot.
- You forgot?
Fucking hell! This is just too much.
- Calm down.
And then you'll drive like that?
- No, you'll drive.
Fuck, I'll get herpes in this shit hole!
Dejo, you hear me? - What?
- What does that guy look like?
Fucking hell!
What's that guy staring at us for?
- What guy?
I'm fucking tired of this, let's go!
- Hang on. - No!
I'm sick and tired of you and Bosnia,
let's get out of here! - No, wait.
Blue... Blue...
- Blue?
What?
- You said 'blue'.
Guy in the blue tracksuit.
How's it going?
You're Dejan? I'm looking for Dejan.
- He's Dejan, I'm Filip.
What's with him? - He's just tired
from all the driving.
It was a long drive and he doesn't
take to cars that well.
He'll be fine.
How's it in Zagreb?
- Nothing special, everything's okay.
Are you getting any?
- Yes.
That's good.
Don't look at it, damn it, take it!
Careful you don't lose it.
- I won't.
You boys know what to do with it?
- We know everything, no problem.
I'd have a coffee with you, but the boss
is waiting, you know how it is. - It's okay.
Good luck.
- Thank you.
You won't fuck up?
- Everything's under control.
Fuck!
What now? Is that it? Is that all?
I guess, I don't know...
- You guess?
Fuck you, Dejo!
Is that the one?
- No.
I know it's here somewhere.
I think we turn right here.
Let's get out of here! - Cool it,
I have to say hello to my aunt.
My mother would kill me if I didn't.
There's my aunt! We're here.
- Great.
Just don't take too long.
- Don't worry.
Auntie!
- Filip, my ray of sunlight!
Fuck...
It's easy to live in Zagreb.
Here, we're next door neighbours,
we depend one each other. - I know.
Enough talk about politics.
What do you want? I'm talking to the
boys, right? - Right, uncle.
I can't stand them anymore.
Who? - Muslims.
- Not so loud!
Except for Reuf, I work with
him, he's a good man.
That's true, Omeragic woman, Jusufpasic
and Hadzibegovic are okay, but I
can't stand the rest.
They all stink of lard!
Enver and Mirza are also good boys.
- What Enver?
The one I play football with.
- Yes, you're right.
And Doctor Fuad, he's a Muslim,
but an expert in his field.
I'm not saying that there aren't
good folk among them,
but the war's to blame.
Damn the war! We didn't need it.
The boys aren't interested in all that.
Come on, boys, eat.
Why aren't you eating?
- He's on a diet.
That's not good, eat. - I can't I feel
sick after the drive.
You are sleeping over, aren't you? You
can drive tired. - No, no, no,
we have to get back and sort out that
load. - Forget the loan now,
of course we'll sleep over, auntie.
You'll take the two bags of potatoes for
your parents before they go to waste.
You know what? We're full.
We bought skiing equipment in Sarajevo
and the car's packed full.
So I thought you could bring them.
You're coming to Zagreb in a few days.
If you could.. you have a bigger car.
- Of course we will.
I got them ready as soon as
I heard you were coming.
We'll bring them. - The boys aren't
interested in your potatoes.
We'll bring them with us.
Let's have a drink.
Here's Reuf, come on in.
- I didn't know you had guests,
I'm just returning your watering can.
Can I put it here. - Yes, come sit down.
How are my neighbours doing?
- This is my nephew and his friend.
Filip.
- Reuf Hadzic, nice to meet you.
They've come from Zagreb?
- All the way from Zagreb?
Just arrived to see their aunt and uncle.
I’ll make a barbecue.
That's not necessary.
- I won't take no for an answer.
Zagreb, that's a serious city.
That's Europe.
A center of culture, a true metropolis.
For me, it's a city of prosperity.
If we had any sense, it would me like
that here, but we can't get along.
That's the way it is.
I often come to Zagreb.
I drive building material for our
Vieko, you don't know him.
You live in the city or somewhere else?
- In the city. - Leave politics out of it.
It's not politics, I'm just asking.
I had a friend in Tito's army.
Nenad Bujanovic was his name.
He was from Zagreb, he had black hair.
He worked in the post office, he had a mole
right here. He was impressionable,
maybe you know him?
I don't know anyone with that name. Dejo,
do you know anyone? - No.
His father, Rudo, was the head of
sales at the chocolate factory.
How are your parents doing? How is
your father's ulcer. - It's fine now.
Here's to our health! Cheers!
I'm glad I met these lads from Zagreb.
It's an amazing city.
I've been there a couple times.
Zagreb stands out from the rest.
They've got Dinamo, a zoo, fairs and trams.
It truly is an agreeable city to
live in. I could live there now.
If someone were to
send me to Zagreb, I'd go.
Cheers!
Why aren't there any cars?
- It's a working day.
Let's turn around.
- Just keep driving!
You want to turn back? You think we
wouldn't look suspicious then?
We should've ditched it somewhere.
- And then what?
Not a car in sight!
- So what?
It's not a good sign.
- Bosnia is no tourist destination.
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon. Passports, please.
Here you are.
It's so humid. It can't be easy
for you standing here all day.
Why the fuck do you care what it's
like for me? Park over there.
Is something wrong? - I'll be the judge
of that. Park over there.
Cool it, will you?
I don't want any bullshit
from you two. Stay put.
Where did you put it?
With the potatoes.
What are you on about?
The potatoes from Bosnia.
You motherfucking son of a bitch!
You shat your pants!
I'll pay you back for that one.
- You were as white as a sheet.
That white?
- Scared shitless.
And the attitude on that cop?
Documents, please!
Face like a bulldog. Moron.
Why the fuck do you care what it's
like for me? Primitive asshole.
Park over there.
- He was so sure of himself.
They were furious when
they didn't find anything.
Stupid fucks.
They were totally baffled.
Saved by the potatoes!
METASTASIS
Sons of bitches!
You goddamn bastard!
Come on down if you dare!
You could have scolded us!
- Got ass fucked by the Serbs, faggot?
Come on down!
What a jerk! Throwing hot water at us.
He's fucked.
- What are you two junkies laughing at?
We have to sort that thing once and for
all! I'm sick and tired of the Serb scum!
If you're not a Serb,
then fuck you, you Catholic!
Who are you telling to fuck off?
To him.
- Maybe he's one of ours.
You don't tell Catholics to fuck off in
Zagreb, got it? - He was only kidding.
That's not kidding, Kizo.
You telling me to fuck off?
- What's wrong with you, Krpa?
He's kidding.
- Shut the fuck up!
His father is a Serb. I don't know
about you, but you're both shady.
Where were you during the war?
- Kizo is also shady then?
While he was fighting in the war,
you two were getting wasted.
And you telling me to fuck off? I'll beat the
shit out of you and go squealing to Helsinki!
It's Dejo, Krpa, what's with you?
I can swear at Catholics,
Serbs don't have that right.
What Serbs?
- You'd know if you'd been in the war!
Who's up for a drink?
- He has to apologize to me first.
I have to say I'm sorry, to you?
And you're going to do that at the
Altar of the Homeland.
What the hell, Krpa? - You're going to
kiss the Altar of the Homeland, you junkie!
We're going to the Altar of the Homeland!
Fuck! They called the cops!
If you puke in the car, I'll kill you
It was only a little.
If you keep driving
like this, I'll puke, too.
Where is it already? - I should've leave
you here. It's here,
can't you see the fire?
What fucking fire?
Can't you see the flame?
When I come here,
I get these feelings inside.
Go on, kneel.
What?
Kneel down and kiss the Altar of
the Homeland, you cunt!
You're crazy.
- I know what I'm doing.
You think I'm kidding?
- Kiss the stone like he says.
You want me to kneel
down and kiss what?
The monument, you stupid
fucking Serbian junkie.
The stone? - What else? It's a
monument, you stupid faggot.
Don't you bloody Serbs get it?
Which one? There are several.
Don't get fucking smart with me.
- Kiss any stone!
I don't want to kiss just any. I want the stone
that does the most justice to the homeland.
Here, this one. There's something
written on this one.
Kiss it, what are you waiting for?
- Okay.
No one fucks with me on my turf!
It wasn't that hard, isn't it?
We need to do something. This sucks.
How are we going to do that?
- I don't know.
Anyone got a light?
What are you doing up? - Do you have
to get drunk every night?
Bullshitting me again?
- It's the same, night after night.
I'm way too tolerant. - I don't have
money for groceries.
What?
You can't be doing this night after
night. Look at this, it's empty!
I've been waiting for you all day.
Why don't you cook and clean?
What did I say?
- You think I'm scared of you? I'm not!
What did I say? - Let go, or I'll
call the police. Police!
You'd call the cops?
You fucking ungrateful bitch!
Leave me alone!
- Mention the cops one more time...
You son of a bitch!
I told you not to call my mother a bitch!
Don't call my mother a bitch!
You goddamn whore, I could
kill you with my bare hands!
Goddamn whore!
Get up off that floor!
Good morning, neighbour.
We couldn't sleep all night, again.
- Yes, so?
I won't tolerate it anymore,
just so you know.
Blow my dick, just so you know.
This is outrageous! You're a primitive
scum! Shame on you!
I'm old enough to be your father.
- Sorry, dad, blow my penis then.
I'll call the police next time!
I won't tolerate that anymore!
I've had enough of your yelling
and things, night after night!
I know well what do you do in there!
I won't stand that anymore!
You want me to come over?
- Come on then!
You think I'm scared of you?
I'm not scared of you!
What are you running for?
Up yours!
Primitive asshole!
You'll mow the lawn...
What? Do you want me to
take you to the doctor?
Do you want me to take you
to the fucking doctor?
I'm asking you for the last time.
What is it then?
Yes? No? I want? I don't want?
I'm too kind.
What's this pigsty in here? What the
fuck is this shit here?
He's yellow.
- Let him sleep.
You've been drinking lemonade, Kizo?
Come on, rise and shine!
Jesus fuck! Look at his dick.
It's all bloated.
Kizo, look, this is for you.
I brought you some fruit.
Why isn't he waking up?
What's with him? - I'm not authorized
to give any information,
you'll have to ask the doctor. Are you
his family? - I'm his cousin.
I'm sorry. - I'm not visiting him again.
We come, he sleeps, doesn't give a fuck.
Maybe a slap in the face will do it.
- Kristina! - I'm just finishing off.
It's time for rounds. I told you
I wouldn't tolerate this.
We would be grateful for
any kind of information.
He's our friend.
- Visiting hours are from four to five.
It's now three. - Did we ask you what
time it was, motherfucker?
Enough with the attitude
and answer the question!
We only give out information to family.
- We are his family, you fucker!
Alright, I'll tell you.
Since you're so rude...
Cut the crap and just say it!
With alcoholic hepatitis
negative patient outcome is high...
Fucking hell! - Just tell us what
the matter is with him.
Unfortunately, he won't
live to see the morning.
Fuck you, Kizo!
Come on, Kizo.
- The doctor is full of bullshit.
I don't think he is.
Come on, Kizo.
During a routine check at the
Bosanska Gradiska border pass
police found a kilo of heroine
hidden in a bag of potatoes
in the car belonging to Reuf H.
who denied knowing it was there.
As the suspect resisted arrest,
police were forced to use force.
Reuf H. was treated for minor
injuries at Stara Gradiska Hospital.
A police inquiry is underway.
Fuck!
Hey, Dejo, it's me. Where are you?
Did you see the news?
We are in deep shit!
Unbelievable shit, man!
I can't talk now, my parents are here.
Come to Arena and I'll tell you all
about it. Just be there.
Hello, dear.
- Hi, mum.
Did Reuf come round? Zora said
he'd bring us the potatoes.
No, no one was here.
- Have you eaten? - Yes.
He doesn't know how to open the fridge.
The prices just keep going up.
- We should go to that supermarket.
And who'll pay for the gas?
Your son?
Where is he?
And?
And what?
- Do you get what you've done?
Me? If I hadn't put it in
with the potatoes
you'd be doing ten years, not Reuf!
And so would I. - This way I'll get ten
slugs in the head. - Please!
Do you have any idea
who we're dealing with?
We have to give them the money today,
we have to give them the money! - Okay.
We'll get the money.
We can do it.
- The fuck we can!
Shall I ask Milica to open the till,
or my dad for a loan? - Go ahead!
Fuck you! How much do we need?
A million? Perhaps we can get a loan.
You think this is funny?
- What am I supposed to do? Cry?
Might as well kill myself.
I don’t want a bullet in the head
and then to end up in the river!
You think I want you
to end up in the river?
Give us two more beers, Milica.
Why weren't we born in Sweden,
the sons of some rich doctor?
We'd probably fuck up there, too.
Fucking hell!
Look at the time, and the
moron is nowhere in sight.
Where's your junkie friend?
- How should I know? I'm not his dad.
If he's not here in five,
we're off without him.
What?
Are you high?
- No, I only had a beer.
Fuck me! I should've told you
to fuck off ages ago!
You can't to dick shit on your own.
What are you on about?
- You're high.
No, I'm not, I just had a beer.
He's fucked us over.
- He'll be here.
No, he won't. Come on, let's go!
Why the panic?
The InterCity train to Amsterdam
leaves from Platform 1.
The InterCity train to
Amsterdam departs at 17:05.
Come here.
Stand here.
Take this. - Fuck! - Take it, you
moron, I'll bash your head! - Alright.
Don't hold it, put it in your pocket,
you fucking junkie!
You have to focus now.
Keep looking left and right.
You have to canvass the area, got it?
Have you got anything I said so far?
- Yes, I look left and right...
If you see the cops...
- I tell you right away.
You'd better, you fuck! You weren't thinking
of doing a runner? - What's with you?
If they're coming from over there,
you yell 'Sava, Sava!'
If they're coming from over there,
yell 'Center, Center!' Got it?
Let's see if you got it.
- If it's from over there
I yell 'Krpa, Sava, Sava.'
- What Krpa? What's with you?
You're Krpa. - You can't yell 'Krpa',
they'll know who I am.
Just 'Sava, Sava' or 'Center, Center.'
- Alright.
Focus and stay put.
Don't stand there like a prick.
Look at your watch,
you're waiting for your date.
- That's a good one.
And don't fuck up.
- I won't, I'll be looking at my watch.
Get on the floor and look down!
Hand over the money! Stop staring!
You want a hole in your head?
What the fuck is this? Give me the money!
- Please don't shoot me!
Just give me the money! What is this?
- That's all there is.
What do you mean? That's it?
- That's all there is!
Give me the money!
- I'll give you my money!
I don't want your fucking money! Lay
down and don't call the cops!
Dejo, you stupid junkie!
What's up, bro?
Fuck! Krpa, Sava, Sava!
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Goddamn fucking junkie!
I've got to stop smoking.
