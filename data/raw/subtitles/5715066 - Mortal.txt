Look at that guy!
A damn bum!
Hey, you! Are you lost?
Hey!
What the hell?
- Don't you turn your back on me...
Don't touch me!
English? What the hell?
You're telling me what to do?
Ole, stop it!
- Who do you think you are?
- Ole!
Hey, hey, I asked you a question.
Ole!
Get up!
If you touch me, you will burn.
Ole, stop messing around.
Get up, come on.
- Oh, shit! Ole!
- Call the police!
She said she wanted to do it.
No one's blaming you.
Not the parents, no one.
Everyone speaks highly of you.
Your colleagues, your clients.
Unfortunately these things happen.
Therapy doesn't always help.
You just started out, and that makes
such an experience particularly horrible.
I didn't believe her, Margrethe.
She said everything I needed to know.
- Didn't she have anyone else?
- No one. I could have stopped her.
This isn't your fault.
It was all there for me
to do the right thing. I didn't.
You had no control over her.
Someone's calling.
You should answer that.
Take some time off.
We'll talk tomorrow. Bye.
Hello. It's Christine Aas.
- Hi.
- Henrik. This way.
I have no experience with criminals.
I work mostly with teenagers.
No one expects a miracle. We only
have an hour before the Crime Unit arrives.
I hope we can make him talk
before they take him.
- What's his name?
- Eric Bergland.
Sounds familiar.
The fire in Årdal three years ago.
Five people died.
- It's him?
- Norwegian-American. Backpacker.
- In Norway looking for relatives.
- He's been in the woods all this time?
There are still many questions
regarding that fire.
But now we have three witnesses
saying he killed the boy.
They say he barely touched him,
and he collapsed and died.
- What has he said so far?
- Not a word.
- Any indication why this happened?
- The big question for me is how.
Eric, my name is Christine Aas,
I'm a psychologist, I...
I don't work for the police,...
...but they've asked me
to come here and talk to you.
Would you like
to come here and sit...
Eric?
Will you come
and sit with me, please?
My English is only so-so. Sorry.
I've never been to America, so...
You descend from Norwegians?
Many generations back, it seems.
How did you find
your family here? Online or...?
Eric?
A lot of people are wondering
what happened last night...
...with you and the boy.
I...
I don't think
you did anything wrong.
I think something
happened that...
...nobody quite understands yet.
But maybe you do?
I think that sometimes...
...bad things happen
to good people.
Awful things.
It's not their fault.
I think people are,
in their hearts, genuinely good.
I tried...
I did. I told him that...
But he didn't listen to me.
He didn't listen to me, you know.
I'm listening.
Tell me.
I tried to tell him.
It's my fault.
I tried to tell him
not to touch me.
And then he...
Henrik, let's remove the handcuffs.
Henrik... Ole's parents
are in the reception.
Bjørn refuses to leave
until he has spoken with you.
Remove his handcuffs and stay close.
Therese.
- I can't even begin to...
- Where is he?
I have to see him.
He killed my son. I have a right to...
We're still trying to understand
what really happened.
We know what happened.
The other boys saw the whole thing.
Yes, we have their statements.
Now we have to hear his side.
I just want to look him in the eyes. Once.
I'm sorry, Bjørn.
The Crime Unit is bringing
an American from the embassy.
They want to take him out of the country.
I'll be right outside.
They were all your relatives,
right?
The people at the farm?
Did everyone die?
Except you.
I was sure you knew.
I'm so sorry.
Eric.
What happened
at the farm in Ardal?
- Hi, I'm from Online News...
- You have no right to be here.
You know I killed them.
And I killed the man too.
I don't understand
how you could have.
That's impossible.
How do you do that?
I don't know.
They were found burned.
This... This doesn't prove...
- Eric!
- Do you believe me now?
What are you doing?
Eric, stop this!
- Stop it now.
- I can't.
It's your emotions!
Turn it off! Turn it off!
- You have to get out of here!
- No!
He needs help to stop this!
Turn off the alarm!
Eric, it's your emotions!
You're setting this off!
If you focus away
from your fears,...
...you can learn
how to control it!
It's coming from inside you,
so it's all up to you!
Isolate yourself from everything
around you! You control it!
Just breathe!
I know you can stop this!
Are you okay?
Eric, this is Cora Hathaway
from the U.S. Embassy.
She's here to help you
get back to America.
- They have no right to do that.
- It's not up to me.
Eric, you have to talk
to them now.
No, I just want to talk to you,
nobody else.
Christine.
Which is why we need
to sedate you, Eric.
I'll do it myself.
Eric?
Watch his head.
They are bringing Bergland
to the helicopter now.
You know we'll never understand
what happened in there?
Maybe we're not meant
to understand everything.
I'm thinking God has
a plan with Eric.
Put this behind you.
It's someone else's headache now.
He's burning up.
The sedation is wearing off.
Eric? Eric, relax.
We're taking you to Oslo
and then somewhere safe.
You'll be
well-taken care of, okay?
We're gonna find out
what's going on with you,...
...I promise.
Eric?
- Give him another dose!
- Relax.
- I've already given him...
...maximum dosage.
Any more, and he could die.
- Eric?
- Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!
Give him another dose now!
- Do it now!
Eric?
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Lie down!
Zero-Zero, emergency,
all main engines switches to off.
Override, Fox Two.
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Mayday,
mayday, mayday! Helicopter going down!
Helicopter Zero-Zero
going down...
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Zero-Zero, we're going
down! Mayday, mayday, mayday! We're going down!
Ditch, ditch, ditch!
Spin out, spin out. 1,200 feet. Ditch! Ditch!
Ditch! Get off, get off! Ditch, ditch, ditch!
We found three bodies in the wreckage.
We're bringing them out now.
- Did you find Bergland?
- No, not yet.
I will try to do this
in English...
...since we have some
foreign people with us today.
As we have not yet contacted...
...the relatives
of the crash victims,...
...I can only say
that we have uncovered...
...three dead bodies
in the helicopter.
One American woman
is in hospital...
...with smaller injuries.
She's doing well
all things considered.
I also cannot tell you the status
of the other American.
But I'll keep you updated.
Okay. Thank you.
Bjørn?
The helicopter was on its way
to Oslo with Bergland...
Where are you going?
The police confirm it is Eric Bergland
they're searching for in Odda.
Christine!
Eric?
I...
The helicopter crashed.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?
I'm going to take you
to my friend's cabin...
...and we'll figure it out, okay?
I'll be right back.
I don't want to hurt you.
Eric?
How did this happen to you?
What is this?
Whoa, I'll just do it,
I don't want to zap you.
Hey, how do I say thank you
in Norwegian?
Norwegian?
Tusen takk.
Tusen takk, Christine.
Is there anyone you'd like
to call back in the U.S.?
When did it start?
At the farm.
I got there,...
...something just started
building up inside of me.
And then I just exploded,...
...and everything burst
into flames.
And...
It is crucial that you understand
how important it is...
...to the U.S. government
that you get Bergland.
You're lucky to be alive.
- That was some crash.
- Thank you.
Two minutes before we took off.
While we were in air
moments before we crashed.
You mean he had something
to do with this?
I saw it with my own eyes.
He created all that.
He made us crash.
He saved your life.
I'm not saying he's a bad person.
I don't care what he is.
We need to find him quickly
and get him under control.
Are you crazy?
He killed lots of people!
He didn't mean to hurt anyone.
- Christine! He's wanted!
- I know that.
You're helping a criminal!
You could go to prison!
Call the police
and explain what happened.
This could ruin your life!
Please call the police,
then call me when you've done it.
I have to hang up.
Let me know when you've done it?
- Hello?
- Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Christine?
Christine?
Christine?
- I didn't mean to...
- It's fine.
I was thinking a lot
about the farm.
- And I was thinking I should...
- Yeah.
What?
We have to go to the police
and you need to turn yourself in.
I just can't do this, it's...
I need to go home.
I can give you a ride back down
if you'd like.
And we could go in together.
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's alright...
...I understand.
- You snore a lot.
- I snore?
Sorry.
Christine...
Christine, I just want
to tell you that I'm... I'm...
I just had a thought that I
wanted it not to rain on you.
Let's not go to the police.
No. You've done enough for me.
I think you should go home.
I don't want to.
We should go to the farm.
Locals are still in shock after
yesterday's tragic events -
- that drew international attention
to the small Norwegian town.
What do you think will happen
when we get to the farm?
I don't know.
While I was there, it felt like
there was something...
...calling me.
It was calling me
towards something.
Welcome on board MS Askeland.
The crossing will take 15 minutes.
Food and drinks can be bought
in the canteen on the top deck.
I love ferries.
It's like taking a break from
the world for a few minutes.
The police are asking anyone in Odda who
have seen Eric Bergland to contact them.
He is a suspect
in yesterday's death in Odda.
The police say the public should not
approach him as he may be dangerous.
Bergland may be in the company
of this woman, Christine...
Eric?
Are you okay?
They know that I'm with you,
so we need to leave.
Now!
What were you doing?
You can't just leave like that.
Christine, the gas station,
the houses and the roads,...
...everything just disappears.
One minute it's all there,...
...and then the next
it's just all fields.
And the sky just becomes
a different color.
Sometimes I just get
pulled into these...
...these visions,
and I see things.
I can't really explain it, I
just see them,...
...it happened since the farm.
I can walk around,
I can touch things,...
I can feel things,
I feel the wind, the heat.
It's freezing,
it felt like I was freezing.
And these are places you've been?
No, they're not places I've been.
Some of these places
don't even seem possible,...
...like they're different worlds.
And in the background
the sky's filled...
...with this enormous shape
that looks like a...
- Like what?
- Like...
I know it sounds strange,
but it looks like a tree.
Like this enormous,
beautiful tree...
...that fills the entire horizon.
When you were sleeping
in the cabin,...
...I just kept thinking
about everything and...
Like, will it stay with you
for the rest of your life?
Where does it come from?
- Are you the next Jesus?
- Jesus didn't make people die.
You can do things
with the atmosphere...
...and air and water.
Who knows what else you can do?
Or what you can achieve if...
...if you learn
how to control it.
Just let me talk to him.
- Are you crazy?
- I...
It's my boyfriend,
he's very sick.
We need to get him to a hospital.
Just, please, help us.
Are you sure he's okay?
Yes.
He's... He's fine.
If they cross that bridge,
we lose them.
If we lose them,
they'll be in Bergen in no time.
We can't have a situation
in the tunnels...
...before the bridge,
that's too dangerous.
They cannot reach a city,
you do agree with me, right?
Just stop them
before they get to that bridge.
Please.
What's going on here?
Is this for you?
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Get out of the vehicle
with your hands in the air!
This is your last warning! Get
out with your hands in the air!
I wish things were different.
Hands up! Over your head!
Get down!
Hands in the air!
Don't move!
Get down on the ground!
Stop, don't move!
- Don't shoot!
- Get down!
Don't shoot!
Put your weapons down!
- Don't! No! Don't touch her!
- Get down!
Take your hands off her!
Tell him to take his hands
off her!
- Show me your hands!
- Take your hands off her!
- Get down, or I'll have to shoot!
- Take your hands off her!
Eric? Can you hear me?
Stay down! Stay down!
Eric, listen to me!
You have to stop this!
Eric?
You have to focus on what you can
do and how you can control it.
Get down, don't get up!
You need to do what you did
at the police station...
...to make it all stop.
- On the ground!
- Keep all the noise out!
Stay down! Stop! Get down!
Stay down!
Help!
Help! Help!
We need a doctor! Help me!
Help me!
Is he alive?
I'll get you away from here. Both of you.
This is Henrik Jondal,
the sheriff in Odda.
I have to get Bergland
to the nearest hospital.
I want a confirmation from someone
official that no one will stop us.
If you don't let us through,
you will be held accountable if he dies.
One moment. We'll get back to you
with a formal statement.
We will let you through on the condition
that you go straight to Ulvik Hospital.
We will set up a security perimeter
around the hospital.
You should have told me
your plans.
You said there was nothing more
you could do. Why are you helping us now?
I have believed in God
my whole life.
If this has anything to do with him,
I don't want to be on the wrong side.
- Where were you going?
- To the farm.
- That burnt?
- He believes that is where it all started.
We're back with an update
from the police station in Hordaland.
\Several police units attended a dramatic
arrest on Hardanger bridge -
\- when local extreme weather appeared
to hit the area around the bridge.
With all due respect, I disagree.
You haven't seen what I've seen.
Imagine in a few days when people
realize what he represents...
...or what he doesn't represent.
Imagine Christians, Muslims,
everyone who believes in God.
Suddenly a God-like human
proves they're all wrong.
He doesn't represent any of them.
What happens then?
I think that's the only thing
we can do.
I'll make sure it happens.
Witnesses claim that Eric Bergland
appeared to summon the storm.
In videos taken at the site Bergland
appears to control the lightning.
Social media are going wild
with speculation.
Several have drawn comparisons
between Bergland and the Norse god Thor.
Are they calling me Thor?
You can't blame them, can you?
The University in Bergen
rejects this claim...
He was an angry God,
but also a protector of mankind.
I'm here with Maja Gundersen.
You witnessed...
He will defeat everyone,
he's Thor!
Bergland has been sent
to Ulvik Hospital for treatment.
The police and army are securing the
site, the public are urged to keep away.
Ventricular fibrillation!
Eric?
Can you hear me?
Eric?
- Christine? Where am I?
- We lost you.
We lost you but the doctors
got your heart going again.
They need to do an MR scan.
No, please, will you just
let me out of here?
No, we need to see
what's going on inside you.
I'm right here, Eric,
right outside.
Just talk to me.
I was there again.
This time everything was frozen,
like an Ice Age.
It still had the same tree,
though.
What tree? What is he talking about?
Sometimes he gets these strange visions.
Okay, Eric, try to relax,
we'll just turn the machine on.
Now we're scanning, there will be
some noises. Just relax.
People have gathered outside Ulvik
Hospital, hoping to see Eric Bergland.
The police confirm that they are assisted
by the American government -
- and the National Guard
to prevent an escalation of the situation.
This looks wrong,
how can he be alive?
What was that?
- Eric?
- Please!
- You have to turn off the machine.
- It won't turn off.
Hold on, hold on!
What the hell!
Is everyone okay?
Eric, are you okay?
The boy in ICU2 has gone into cardiac
arrest. All the defibrillators are dead.
What did she say?
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
You're a monster!
You killed my only son.
Bjørn!
This is a big mistake!
Please. Don't do this.
I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
There is somebody else's kid
about to die...
...and you need to let me go
help them now.
Thank you.
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
Can I try something, please?
No, no.
No, no.
Let him.
Please.
Thor is Norwegian!
Eric...
Touch me! Touch me, Eric!
The army is fencing off the farm
to keep the public away.
And to keep things safe for Eric.
For us all.
What do you think they expect
from me?
Read the page I've marked.
THOR WITH THE HAMMER
What?
Are you all right?
Aft...
After Thor and all the other gods
died at Ragnarok,...
...his two sons built a farm
on the ruins of Asgard...
...to restart their lives...
...and rescue all the knowledge
the gods possessed...
...to prepare for their return.
This place we're going to,...
...what if that is the farm
Thor's sons built?
What if that's the reason
you're connected to it?
What if you are his descendant?
Can I just have a minute, please?
Why don't the two of us go up
and have a look first?
It doesn't look that old.
There may have been many houses here
through all these years.
Do you remember anything?
I can't get up! I can't move!
We need help to dig here.
Yes. Sierra 2 Charlie
has arrived at the site.
They have requested an excavator
to dig under the fire plot. Over.
Ma'am? They're ready for you.
Sierra 2 Charlie, we've got eyes
on target. Awaiting orders, over.
If anything happens
that escalates the situation,...
- ... we're gonna fire on him.
- Copy that.
Like what?
I'm not sure yet.
It all happened so fast.
The house just lit on fire...
And I just watched
those people die...
It wasn't your fault.
Shouldn't we wait
for an archaeologist?
Eric? I think we've found
a crypt or a cave.
We will go down first.
I don't want to risk
another fire.
Stay here, and I'll let you know
if you should come.
Okay?
Target is isolated.
Looks like they have found
something...
...underneath the fire plot.
Runestones.
What is this place?
The knowledge of all the dead gods -
- which Thor's sons collected
after Ragnarok.
They were described as runes.
The Norse gods' own words.
Yggdrasil. The World Tree.
Which shows the nine worlds
of the Norse mythology.
It's time for Eric
to come down here.
It's your turn now.
See what it is and then get out
of there as quickly as you can.
They're ready for you.
Okay, Eric, follow the walkway
to the back wall.
There's a mural there
with a big tree on it.
A box is in front of that mural.
The workers,
they are equipped to open it.
But please let them out of there
before you do anything.
What is this?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
I think it's time for us
to leave.
The workers are coming back out.
No visual on Bergland.
We assume he's still down there.
Christine? It's a hammer.
The workers are saying
Eric is now alone with the box.
They say they've found a chest.
Did you hear that?
A chest!
What's happening? Are you okay?
The hammer is protecting me.
Please come back up.
He's holding a hammer.
The object is a hammer.
I can see something in his hand.
Permission to fire.
We have civilians coming
to the site.
What's the order?
Are we firing or what?
- Ma'am?
- Fire.
Female casualty.
Christine, stay with me!
Christine! No, no, no!
No, no, no!
The number of casualties following the
tragedy in Årdal is still unconfirmed.
This is absolutely devastating.
Norway is still in shock...
The cult of Thor...
With the terrorist Eric Bergland
still at large...
There is still no sign of Eric Bergland.
