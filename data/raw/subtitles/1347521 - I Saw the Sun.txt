- Eagle to dragon, over.
- Dragon receiving you, over.
Dragon, what are your coordinates, over?
Eagle, we're 2200 southwest
of the Çemçem mountains.
I'm reading off our coordinates.
4652596250.
I repeat, 4652596250.
Do you read me? Over.
Roger. Reading you, Dragon.
We'll be there any minute.
Eagle, move forward in direction 12.
Roger, Dragon.
The cave is right in front of us.
Eagle Squadron is ready to fire.
Eagle Two is ready.
Eagle Three is ready.
Fire!
Fire!
Eagle Two, Eagle Three... There are
mo terrorists running in direction 3.
Track them.
Do whatever is necessary.
Eagle Two, they're in front of you
in direction 3, over.
Roger. They're in range right now.
We're ready to fire, over.
Eagle Two, don't fire! Don't fire!
They're villagers.
Eagle to base, do you read me, over?
Base reading you, over.
Mission accomplished.
We're returning to base, over.
Hey, Ramo and Mamo are back!
- What happened?
- You got caught in the crossfire again?
- Where have you been?
- What happened? You're OK, aren't you?
They'll kill us one of these days.
It's only a matter of time.
Another operation, right?
Did you sell the chickens and
the cheese? What happened?
That's the last time I go to
sell chickens, damn it!
Ramo, we have to go into town.
Even if it rains bombs.
Is all that milk and cheese
supposed to go to waste?
They'll kill us, Uncle Davut.
We'll die for nothing.
We don't have any choice, Mamo.
- Ramo, son. Your wife's giving birth.
- Are you serious, dad?
God willing, you'll get what you want.
Get me a comb.
A comb?
You keep out of this.
Hold on baby, hold on.
Zehra, get the water ready.
OK, Mum. I'll be right back.
Hold on baby, almost there.
Come on! This time it'll be a boy.
I combed my hair like this
with the first one. And it was a boy.
You'll see.
It'll definitely be a boy this time.
Dear God, listen to Musto!
And give me a boy.
Ramo...
I also have a hunch
that it'll be a boy this time.
Well anyway, Mamo,
if it isn't a boy this time...
- Yes?
- There'll be no stopping me.
Stop jigging your leg.
Hey, stop jigging!
Are you off your head?
Get off!
Son of a bitch!
What a beautiful baby!
Aren't you a beauty?
Here, my love. God bless her!
Zehra, run and give
them the good news.
Zehra, what is it?
Ramo, first I want my treat,
then I'll give you the good news.
Hey! It's a boy! It's a boy!
Ramo! Ramo!
Ramo! Ramo! Good news!
What is it, Kado?
First I want my treat.
Kado, what is it?
What do I care? First my treat!
Stop talking like a girl.
Out with it, you queen!
Ramo...
Yes?
Congratulations!
It's a gorgeous little girl!
What?
A girl, Ramo.
Hey, didn't I tell you not to run
if it was a girl?
Bastard!
Fuck your hair as well!
Come on, dad. Get yourself ready.
We're going to look for another wife.
Don't mess it up.
Mum, he'll get a second wife now.
Where are the women?
If there were any.
Mamo would have married by now.
Don't cry, Havar. Ramo loves you.
He'd never marry again.
Really?
Sure.
He adores you.
I don't know.
Didn't I say I'd marry again
if it was another girl?
Yes, you did.
I heard.
I didn't.
Dad, we know you're blind.
But are you deaf as well?
Ramo, we have enough
troubles as it is.
If God doesn't give you a son,
why is Havar to blame?
I wish God had given me a girl.
Uncle Davut, you all have boys.
I want one too.
Look, son. It's always been your wife
who's looked after us and the animals.
For my sake, give it one more try.
Ramo wouldn't take a second wife
alongside my sister, Uncle Haydar.
Nephew... Do whatever is fitting
for the family.
Dad, let's put up a photo of Serhat
so my mo brothers are side by side.
We can't put them side by side, son.
Why not?
We can't do that, son.
We can't.
Havar, Mum told me this ages ago.
If a woman looks at little boys a lot
when she's pregnant, she'll have a boy.
So spend lots of time with my boys
and you'll have one yourself.
Mum, grandpa's given the baby a name!
- Not your dad?
- No. Grandpa did.
He said our new sister
should be called Bemal.
Zelal, Delal, Hazal, Seval
and now Bemal!
Come on, let's go.
Havar, why are you upset?
There's nothing wrong...
with her being a girl.
I like girls.
ONE YEAR LATER
Take good care!
Goodbye!
The soldiers are here!
- Selam aleykum!
- Aleykum selam, captain. Welcome!
Hello, friends!
Ahmet, welcome to you too.
If you're hungry,
Gülistan will feed you.
Thanks, Davut.
But I'm not hungry.
Davut Bey, let's go and talk.
Of course, captain. After you.
Havar, make some tea!
Come here, kids! Over here!
These sweets are for you. Here.
- Take as many as you like.
- Ahmet! Can I have some too?
How's our soldier? Is he OK?
Fine, captain.
He'll be back on leave in a few days.
Good. His duty to the country
will soon be done.
Right.
Any news of your other son?
No.
Davut Bey, let me get to the point.
Listen, you can't have a home
within a home, a state within a state.
Talk to your other son.
Get him to give himself up
under the new amnesty.
Who doesn't want to have
their children living with them?
You must help us.
Look, Kerim has left.
Any developments with you?
Whenever my brother Haydar
decides, that's when we'll be leaving.
Hear me, Lord. Hear me
in the name of all the prophets.
Give me a son like Ismail, the son
You gave the Prophet Abraham.
If you give me a son, I promise
to make You offerings for seven years.
Welcome to the show, ladies!
Welcome to you all!
Welcome, welcome!
Wherever you are, let me wish you
health, happiness and heaps of money!
Thank you very much!
What's with that girly voice?
Look, don't make my blood boil!
You're not a girl
so why talk like one?
Mamo, where have you been?
Get up!
Get the fuck out of here!
I don't want to see you again.
Is something wrong, son?
Where have you been?
No, dad.
Everything's OK.
I brought the sheep back on my own.
I don't know where Ramo went.
You'll see. This time it'll be a boy.
Just wait and see.
Musto, please shut up!
Whenever you say
it's a boy, it's always a girl.
This time it will be a boy.
If I say so, it will be!
Musto, you have three sons.
Shut up, will you!
Come on, Havar! Get to it!
I tell you, I have a hunch too.
What's it going to be?
A boy.
Relax!
You see? He said it'll be a boy.
He said so himself!
Aaaaaa!
Come on, sweetie! Keep going.
You're almost there!
The baby's coming, my love!
Here he is! Praise be to God!
Gülistan, cut the cord. Wrap the baby.
And let's break the good news!
It's a boy!
Ramo...! Ramo...!
Great news...!
Ramo!
Ramo!
Great news, Ramo!
Hey, what is it?
What do I care?
First my treat!
Talk like a man!
What do I care?
First my treat!
Ramo, you've had a son!
What?!
Ramo, where are you going?
Well done, my love!
Thanks, mum.
You see?
What did I tell you?
What did you tell me?
Spend lots of time with my boys
and it'll be a boy. See? It worked!
Ramo! Congratulations, son.
You've finally got what you wanted.
Wow!
In the name of God,
the Compassionate, the Merciful...
I thought you were going to
get a second wife.
- Who said so?
- You did.
She's perfect, your mother.
The sunshine of my life.
Come here. She's perfect, your mother.
I adore her. I'd do anything for her!
Pakize... Gülistan...
Thank you. Bless you both.
Let me go out with my son.
I'll be back in five minutes.
Where are you going, Ramo?
Where are you taking the baby?
Mum, the baby has only just been born!
Where he's going, mum?
How do I know, my love?
Hey, Ramo! Where are you going?
He's crazy.
Crazy Ramo!
But the baby has only just been born!
Call him back, dad!
Ramo! Where are you taking
the baby? He'll get sick!
Dear Lord...
You heard my prayers.
You have my word.
You will have my offerings.
May my son be a friend to everyone
and as worthy as the Prophet.
And may his name be...
To be honest, Lord,
I haven't thought about that.
You always give me girls, don't you?
Congratulations, Ramo!
You finally got what you wanted.
Thanks.
When is yours due?
This month, God willing.
Do you want a girl or a boy?
Hopefully yours will be a boy too.
Whatever.
So long as it's healthy...
Good luck to you, Private Ahmet!
Thanks.
- Berat, how long till discharge?
- I've got 86 days left.
My leave finishes in six days.
How long have you got, Ahmet?
- Eighty-four days.
- Not long then.
No, not long.
Berat hasn't got long either.
- Thanks.
- Good luck with it.
Congratulations, Ramo.
Thanks, captain.
Welcome.
Have a seat, captain.
Welcome, captain.
Thank you.
Have a seat.
Your prayers are answered.
I hope he grows up fit and healthy.
Thanks, captain.
Well, Ramo, it's time
you sent the kids to school.
Captain...
You know all the schools have closed.
The nearest one is 40 km away.
That's only to be expected here.
Circumstances don't allow, friends.
You need to work something out
and leave here as soon as possible.
We know about farming and livestock,
captain.
The state tells us to leave.
But it doesn't give us work
or a roof over our heads.
Not another operation!
We don't want to stay here either
but we don't have any choice.
Get the vehicles ready!
Serhat...
Serhat!
Son! Son! Son!
Serhat...
Berat...
You're brothers, son.
Don't ever forget that.
Serhat...
Serhat, son...
Why did you go?
Come back home.
Dad, there's no going back
with this business.
You know that.
We're the dead children
of an outcast people.
You're not an outcast!
I joined the guerrillas for you!
I've risked my life for you!
Son, is death ever an answer?
Whatever I do, I'm doing it for you.
One day, you'll all understand that.
Mum, I have to go.
Let me go!
Don't go!
Don't go!
Let me go, Mum!
Don't go!
Don't go!
Serhat...
what would happen...
if we met in battle one day?
If I was killed, I'd be a terrorist.
If you were killed, you'd be a martyr.
Come on!
Serhat!
Serhat!
What's happening, dad?
Don't be afraid, kids!
It's Father God making lightning.
Now come on, go back to sleep!
Mines exploding out there, dad!
It's Father God, my love!
Go back to sleep, kids.
Look, Zelal isn't afraid.
Come on, my little doves.
Back to sleep now! Come on!
What are you doing?
Why are you up?
Come on now!
Back to bed!
Mum, what's happening?
I bear witness that there
is no God but Allah.
I bear witness that Muhammed
is the Messenger of Allah.
Captain, the village is clear!
Friends...
Were the terrorists here last night?
Did you see them?
I'll ask you again. Did you see
the terrorists, or didn't you?
I didn't see a soul, I swear.
If it turns out you
helped the terrorists
the consequences will be severe.
You'll be arrested
for aiding and abetting terrorism.
Look, the state is sovereign.
An operation happens
right under your noses...
and you say you saw nothing!
Terrorists don't make good friends.
We're here for you, friends.
We've taken to the mountains for you.
This country is yours.Scores of young
people are giving their lives for you.
I'm sorry to say we lost
four of our men last night.
Seven terrorists were captured dead.
Davut Bey...
Come to the riverbank to identify
the bodies of the terrorists.
This village is to be evacuated
within mo months.
Yes, sir!
Captain, Haydar is rather headstrong.
He insists on staying.
If he doesn't go, none of them will.
Caner, you can't afford to be
amicable or sympathetic in this case.
As long as the villagers keep helping
the rebels, this thing will drag on.
They have to leave
so we can combat terrorism.
If the state had held out a hand here,
if people's wounds had been nursed...
things would never have got
as complicated as they are, sir.
They used to say fire burns
the hand that touches it.
But now it seems as if
fire burns everything in sight.
Havar... Havar, what's the matter?
Havar...
Havar, what's wrong?
Nothing. My stomach hurts.
You haven't been yourself for days.
Is something wrong? Talk to me.
There's nothing wrong.
It's OK. I'm fine.
Let's go to the fountain.
Havar, should we tell Ramo
to take you to a doctor?
Don't you dare say a word!
I'm fine.
Zehra...
This village used to be so nice.
It was full of people.
Right. And now it's
completely empty.
We're the only people left.
Soon they'll be sending us away too.
Havar, do you want another child?
Well, I'll do whatever Ramo wants.
He's the pillar of my life.
- Do you want more?
- I always want more.
Crazy girl!
But Musto said let's have another.
What?
Won't you ever be satisfied?
You've had three boys!
What more do you want?
Havar, I want a girl.
I hope God will give me a girl.
Girls are OK.
You can't say the same for boys here.
They either become guards or
soldiers, or they join the guerrillas.
They have no other chance.
Gülistan, don't worry.
Everything's OK.
Think good thoughts
so good things happen.
Hello there.
Hello.
Is this where Ahmet Baran lives?
Yes.
Could we come in?
This way.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Has something happened to Ahmet?
Captain...
Captain...
We lost Ahmet at dawn this morning.
My condolences.
Bless the land he died for.
That's Private Ahmet
second from the left.
Have you decided yet?
When are you leaving?
I told you before.
I have nowhere else to go.
It's not in my hands.
You have to leave the village at once.
Winter's on its way, son.
We don't know what to do
or where to go.
OK, let's say we do leave.
What are we supposed to live on?
Look, if you like
I'll talk to my father.
You can settle in Giresun
and work in the hazelnut business.
My family will help you there.
Davut Bey...
Keep your spirits up.
I've made up my mind.
I'm going to Norway.
What?
Norway?
Where did you get that idea, Davut?
I'm going to join Nedim.
Friends, you need to
make up your minds like Davut.
Dad, let's go to Istanbul.
Come on. Don't be so stubborn.
Go wherever you like.
The only way I'll leave this village
is as a corpse!
Davut Bey...
You've been like a father
to my soldiers. Thanks.
I hope you'll be happy
where you're going.
One day, this business will end...
and you'll all come back to
your land and your houses.
This land, these houses are yours.
We'll take good care of them.
I'll never return to a land
where brother kills brother...
and guns speak louder than words.
What's going on? Who isn't stopping
the turmoil? It beats me.
If only everyone was like you.
Give us your blessing.
You have my blessing.
Come on, Kado!
What are you doing?
OK, I'm coming!
I promise you, captain,
I'll send my kids to school!
Kado! Run!
Quick! Run!
Hold on, Kado!
That's it.
Now jump!
Davut... Haydar...
Good luck to you both.
May God keep you safe, Isa.
You too.
Thank you.
Come on, uncle! Let's go here!
Mamo! Istanbul is full of girls!
Find yourself one and get married!
Fortune will decide, Musto!
Dad, how far away is Mersin?
I don't know son. No idea.
Davut...
What have we done to deserve this?
What are we going to do in Istanbul?
I told you, Haydar.
My friend Cuma will help us there.
Havar, what's going on?
Pillar of my life...
I'm not well.
What's the matter?
What's wrong with you?
I'm bleeding a lot.
Why didn't you say
and I'd take you to a doctor?
I couldn't bear you worrying.
- Please take me to a doctor.
- OK.
I'll take you, sunshine of my life.
Come here.
The place is so big, Mamo.
Right, there's no end to it.
It's so beautiful, isn't it, Mamo?
Right. It's beautiful, Kado.
Really beautiful.
My little doves! Look at the sea.
Havar, the sea!
Look, Kado! Look!
There's another bridge!
Wow! Unbelievable!
Look at that! Wonders never cease!
Hey, dad!
Istanbul's really beautiful.
Are you out of your mind, son?
This is the house. Let's see.
Hopefully you'll like it.
- Selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam, Cuma.
We have a bedroom here.
This is the living room.
You pay mo months in advance
and a month's rent deposit.
What do you think?
It's fine, Cuma.
OK, Mustafa.
I'll see you this evening.
No problem, Cuma.
Well, move your things in right away.
OK, Cuma.
How long were you in jail, Cuma?
Forget it. It's all over now.
It really doesn't matter
how long I was in jail or why.
How are you?
Let's say I'm fine
and maybe I will be.
Have a good catch!
OK, this is the last lot.
Take it away!
Cuma, what are those birds?
The ocean's most beautiful creatures.
They're called seagulls.
- Seagulls?
- Aha.
They're like the wild doves
we have back home.
Wild doves aren't tied to any place.
They live completely freely.
The whole world is theirs.
Hey, Cuma I want to sign up
my little doves for school.
What do I have to do?
There's a school near us.
We'll sort something out. Don't worry.
Thanks a lot, Cuma. Bless you.
Come on, Mamo.
Hey, what's going on?
You disgrace to men!
What are you still doing here?
You lot should be slaughtered
one by one.
What do you want?
Help...! Help...!
Yell all you like, sweetie!
Now fuck off before you get
yourself in any more trouble!
Move it! Come on!
Out of here!
Scum!
They pollute the neighbourhood!
But they're going to go.
Count on it.
When did the pains start?
With the baby before last.
How many children do you have?
Six.
Were they all home births?
Aha.
How old were you
when you got married?
Thirteen.
Is your husband a relative?
My first cousin.
The signs aren't good.
There's a problem in the womb.
We'll decide what to do as soon as
the results come back from pathology.
Selam aleykum, dad.
Aleykum selam.
Selam aleykum, dad.
- Welcome.
- How are you, Havar?
Fine, dad.
Kids, I've got news for you.
You'll be going to school soon.
- School?
- When will we be going, dad?
Soon, my love.
Very soon. OK?
OK.
Dad...
Where's Kadri?
Well, your uncle and his lot went
to sort out their passport business.
I told Kado not to go.
But he didn't listen and went out.
You saw for yourself today.
People are cruel and selfish.
Discrimination is bad and outdated.
It's so hard to live freely
in this country.
You looked at me so sweetly today.
Let's hear about you.
Who are you? What do you do?
Where have you come from?
We're from the east.
They evacuated our village.
We were told to leave.
We had no choice.
So we came here.
You're the first person
I've met in Istanbul.
You're the first person
I've talked to.
You'll be my first friend.
My name's Can.
But around Taksim they call me Cansu.
And I'm Kadri.
But in the village they call me Kado.
Isn't Cansu a girl's name?
Yes, of course it is.
But you're a man.
No I'm not.
What are you?
A transvestite.
What?
What's that?
The decision is yours, Davut.
If you like, we can go and
talk to those men I found.
We need to be very careful though.
They're people traffickers after all.
Well, have they done
this business before?
It's their job.
We'll go and talk to them tomorrow.
All right.
Havar, I'm going to the grocery shop.
Do you want anything?
No, Kadri.
Gülistan, why are you so sad?
Your son will be back
from the army soon.
Everything comes from God.
Is there ever an end to our troubles?
Havar, aren't you ready yet?
Hurry up!
We're going on a day trip.
Gülistan, come with us if you like.
Kids, dad, come on!
We're going out. Come on!
Hurry! We're going to see the sea.
Quick! Come on!
Delal my love, hold my hand.
Come on, grandpa.
Kadri! Kadri! Kadri! Come here!
Come on! Come over!
Mamo, is Norway a nice place?
Norway?
Aha. Very nice.
Dad, when are we going?
It won't be long now, son.
Dad, will they give me
an artificial leg in Norway?
Let's go, Davut.
The men are expecting us.
OK.
Let's go.
Come on, son.
Is this the cute caterpillar
you were talking about?
Yes. Kadri...
This is Petek.
Hello.
Welcome.
Hello.
Tuana...
- Welcome.
- Tansu...
- Welcome.
- And I'm Fifi!
And this is my dad.
Here, girl.
Need a wax too?
Hey! Leave the kid alone.
Poor little newbie!
Run! Go on, run!
Slow down, my love!
Don't fall in the sea.
Don't cry now.
Welcome, boss.
The doctor's forbidden it.
How many people?
Four.
It's 3000 Euros per head.
That makes 12,000 Euros.
We take the money upfront.
You heard.
That's really a lot of money.
Well, if we pay it all upfront,
what happens afterwards?
Your situation is risky, sir.
If you don't trust us, don't go.
It's that simple.
We'll be finished, friend,
if we don't go to Norway.
Well, how will they get to Norway?
We'll talk about that later.
First let them make up their minds.
Shipping is our business.
Dad! Wait, dad!
As I said, the machine gets
everything spotless.
You just have to press this button.
Is everything clear, madam?
Havar, he's asking you.
Is everything clear?
Yes. Yes, it is.
Yes, it is, friend.
Good.
I hope it serves you well, then.
Thanks.
Here's my card.
Any problems, give me a call.
OK.
Havar...
I went to a friend's house today.
All the men there were like women.
What are you talking about, Kado?
Mamo will kill you if he hears.
I spoke to Kerim today.
They found work right away in Mersin.
They seem to be doing really well.
Good. May things keep getting better.
Davut, how did you get on?
God willing, we'll leave
as soon as Berat gets back.
We've got a long trip.
Feed and water the animals.
Give them plenty to eat, OK?
I'll be there in a couple of hours.
Zaza! Load them on!
Come on!
Ok!
Load them on!
Move it!
Where have you been, friend?
The traffic...
What's all that?
Personal belongings.
We're not a removal company, sir.
It's one bag per passenger.
What's that?
A partridge.
We're carrying enough animals, sir.
No can do.
Now come on! Move!
Come on! Quick!
Get off your asses!
Haydar..
Zaza!
Fill the truck up!
Thanks for everything.
Don't mention it.
Come on!
Move it!
We've got a long trip!
Move!
I'll introduce you to my boyfriend.
Let's see if you like him.
Come on! Move!
My beautiful girls...
My precious little ones!
Your dad's going to buy you uniforms.
And you're going to go to school.
Study as hard as you can.
OK, my love?
Delal...
You be a teacher.
Zelal, you...
You be a doctor!
And you, Hazal...
You be an engineer.
Mum, what shall I be?
A district governor.
You be a district governor.
We'll decide about Bemal
when she's grown up a bit.
And Serhat can be
whatever his dad wants.
Mum, we'll study very hard
when we go to school.
Well done, my beautiful girls.
Mum, when are we going back
to the village?
But, my love...
We only just got here. The village?
No, there's no village.
Forget all about the village.
Come here.
That's it, my beautiful girl.
