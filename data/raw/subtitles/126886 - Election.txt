- Hey, Mr McAllister.
- Not wasting any time, are you?
- You know about the early bird.
- Yeah, I do.
- Good luck there, Tracy.
- Thanks. I'll see you in class.
None of this would have happened
if Mr McAllister hadn't meddled.
He should have accepted things and
not tried to interfere with destiny.
You can't interfere with destiny,
that's why it's destiny.
If you try to interfere, the same
thing's going to happen anyway.
It's hard to remember how it
started, the whole election mess.
I do remember that I loved my job.
I was a teacher, an educator.
I couldn't imagine
doing anything else.
Mr McAllister, quit daydreaming
and get back to work.
The students knew it wasn't
just a job for me. I got involved.
Put down the cards, boys.
This game is over.
Come on, Wolverines.
Defence!
I knew I touched their lives during
their difficult young-adult years.
I took that responsibility
seriously.
In the 12 years I taught history
and current events at Carver-
- I was voted teacher of the year
three times. A school record.
Teaching was all
I'd ever wanted to do.
Trying to get young people
excited about the world.
Trying to prepare them for the tough
decisions they'd face as adults.
That's how I wanted
to spend my life.
Is this a moral situation
or an ethical situation?
What's the difference between
morals and ethics anyway? Derek?
Ethics is when you do
what society tells you to do.
- Morals...
- You're on the right track.
Can anybody help him out?
Michelle.
Morals are like lessons,
like the moral of a story.
It's what you learn
from a story or a fable.
Or a life experience.
And ethics?
Ethics is how you use the morals
that you learn from the story.
We're missing something key here.
What are we missing?
- Tracy.
- Ethics are rules of conduct...
I'd seen a lot of ambitious students
come and go over the years, -
- but Tracy Flick
was a special case.
People who think I'm an overachiever
are just jealous.
My mum tells me I'm special.
Looking at what I've accomplished
so far, you'd have to agree.
Here I am as Hodel
in "Fiddler on the Roof".
Here I am on KCHS,
our student TVstation.
The littering must stop.
Tracy Flick reporting.
The Student Government Association
is where I made my biggest mark.
I never missed a single meeting
and led nearly every committee.
I agree with Ashley. What happened
last time was a travesty.
It reflected poorly on all of us.
Now Tracy Flick was poised to win
the presidency of the student body.
So far,
she was running unopposed.
Determined by a culture...
There's one more thing about Tracy
I think you should know.
Her pussy gets so wet,
you can't believe it.
I don't want to know that.
A few months earlier, she'd got into
some trouble with my best friend.
Dave Novotny.
Dave came to Carver the year after
I did, and we hit it off right away.
Dave taught because
he didn't want to leave high school.
Basically he was a good guy.
Our wives became best friends, too.
When Dave and Linda's son was born,
they asked us to be his godparents.
You probably think that Mr Novotny
was abusing one of his students.
It wasn't like that.
Our relationship was based on
mutual respect and admiration.
During my sophomore year it was
strictly professional between us.
It wasn't until junior year
that things got kind of serious.
The yearbook editors
were celebrating after a deadline.
Dave and I were left alone.
We got to talking.
Not like teacher and student,
but like two adults.
I noticed that you don't
have any close friends.
- You seem to be a loner.
- I'm just real busy.
I know it's not by choice.
I just mean that...
A person like you... It must be
hard to find someone to talk to.
What do you mean?
What kind of person am I?
I've been watching you
for going on three years now.
I think you are one of the most
talented, hardworking, attractive -
- brilliant students...
human beings I have ever met.
Thank you.
I know sometimes people like you
pay a price for their greatness.
And that price is loneliness.
Maybe I'm wrong.
It just seems to me
that you might need a friend.
Growing up without a dad, you might
assume I wanted a father figure.
But that had nothing to do with it.
Dave was just so strong.
He made me feel safe.
It was the first time
somebody ever saw the real me.
Okay, get down.
When I think back on
my relationship with Mr Novotny, -
- what I miss most is our talks.
You did it in your own house?
I know it seems crazy.
What I'm trying to tell you -
- is that Tracy and I
are totally, totally... in love.
- In love?
- Yeah. It's serious.
She inspires me.
She even wants to read my novel.
- You haven't written your novel.
- I've got it all right here.
Tracy wants me to write it
so she can read it. It's beautiful.
Dave, I'm just saying this
as your friend...
What you're doing is really wrong,
and you've got to stop.
The line you've crossed
is immoral and illegal.
I don't need a lecture on ethics.
- I'm talking about morals.
- What's the difference?
I guess I don't have to tell you
how this all turned out.
MAUI IS FOR LOVERS
Take my hand...
Tracy, let's go to Paradise.
Love, your "teacher", Dave.
P.S. I really need you now.
Tracy's mum,
she doesn't understand.
I'd say she doesn't.
I have never seen a mother so upset.
I know what Tracy told her mother,
what her mother told me.
I need to hear this from you.
I have a legal responsibility here.
Did you cross the line
with this girl?
We're in love.
Your novel?
Are you fucking kidding me?
After Dave got fired, Linda kicked
him out and filed for divorce.
He moved back in with his parents.
He's lucky he's not injail.
- Ethics are the basis of...
- We'll pick up here next time.
- Could I retake the last test?
- You want to retake it?
I had to work late
the night before.
Now I have more life experience,
I feel sorry for Mr McAllister.
He's stuck in the same little room,
wearing the same clothes, -
- saying the exact same things
year after year-
- while his students go to college,
move to big cities, -
- do great things
and make loads of money.
He's got to be a little jealous.
It's like my mum says: "The weak
always try to sabotage the strong. "
It's important to know
that I'm an only child.
My mum is really devoted to me.
I love her so much.
She wants me to do
all the things that she couldn't.
Mum used to be a stewardess
and now she works as a paralegal.
She likes to write letters
to successful women -
- and ask them what advice
do they have for her daughter.
They say you have to hold onto
your dreams no matter what.
You have to work hard and not
let anything stand in your way.
- Hey, put those back!
- Eat me.
But winning isn't everything.
Ethical conduct is more important.
Just ask Mr McAllister.
Mr McAllister, wait up!
Mr McAllister, don't go.
I got all my signatures.
There's 158, way more than I need.
- Super.
- Here they are.
I'll take a look at them tomorrow.
Could you approve them now? I'd like
to start campaigning in the morning.
- Yeah, those look good to me.
- Aren't you supposed to keep them?
- No, that's fine.
- You're supposed to keep them.
- Right, fine.
- Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
So far there's no competition.
Coca-Cola spend more money
than anybody on advertising.
I guess that's how
they stay number one.
Yeah...
Good luck there, Tracy.
When I win the presidency, we'll
be spending a lot of time together.
I would like that time to be
harmonious and productive.
- Wouldn't you?
- Sure.
Okay, that's what I thought.
I was just checking.
- Good luck, Tracy.
- Okay.
I don't blame Tracy for the trouble
with Dave. Dave was an adult.
She got on my nerves,
but I admired Tracy.
Thank God for Diane. She was
my source of love and strength.
We'd had bumpy times,
but we'd always seen them through.
After nine years of marriage,
we were closer than ever.
- Anything wrong?
- No... just school.
When I win the presidency, we'll
be spending a lot of time together.
Lots of time.
President and advisor.
Harmonious and productive.
Close and special.
You and I.
- Crystal, what are you doing here?
- I've come to see the big game.
- What if coach Henderson walks in?
- I'd take care of him.
- What are you reading?
- I'm just reviewing my play book.
We can practise. You be
quarterback. I'll be tight end.
Coca-Cola is the world's
number-one soft drink.
Paul.
I was so mad at God when I broke
my leg at Shadow Ridge.
Why?
The doctors told me I'd have to
quit sports for a couple of years.
No first-string quarterback.
It was like the end of my life.
When I got back to school
everyone was supportive -
- but I couldn't shake the feeling
that now my life had no purpose.
What did God want from me?
Why did I exist?
You can search everywhere
for answers.
Then one day, destiny just walks up
and taps you on the shoulder.
I know because it happened to me.
Paul, can I speak to you?
Mr McAllister changed my life.
No matter what they say he did,
I believe he is a good man.
You've been pretty down
since your accident.
I wanted to play football again
so bad I could taste it.
- Go on to the playoffs...
- I understand disappointment.
I personally think you have
a very bright future ahead of you.
- I'm not talking about sports.
- What do you mean?
You're a natural leader. You're
one of our most popular students.
And you don't crack under pressure,
as we all saw in the Westside game.
All the kids look up to you.
What does that spell?
Student council president.
Who me? No... I don't
know anything about that stuff.
- That's Tracy Flick's thing.
- She's a real go-getter.
- And she's super nice.
- Yeah.
But one person assured of victory
undermines democracy.
That would be
more like a dictatorship.
- What's your favourite fruit?
- Pears.
- Good, let's say...
- Wait!
- Apples.
- Apples. Fine.
Let's say all you ever knew
were apples.
You might think apples were good,
even if some were rotten.
But one day, there's an orange.
Now you can make a decision.
Do you want an apple or an orange?
That's democracy.
- I also like bananas.
- Exactly. Good.
What do you say?
Give a little something back.
- How's that?
- Just a little higher.
Eric, you can't put tape
on the outside of the poster!
You'd better take
the whole thing down and redo it.
- Who put you up to this?
- What do you mean?
You suddenly decided
to run for president?
I just thought...
I told Mr McAllister that I want
to do something for the school.
- Mr McAllister asked you to run?
- I talked to him.
He thought it was a good idea.
He said that there's
all different kinds of fruits.
Tracy, you're the best.
I just thought...
Okay, you're on, Mr Popular.
Paul Metzler didn't upset me.
Nothing was further from the truth.
He was no competition for me.
I just had to work a little harder.
I believe in the voters.
This isn't a popularity contest.
They know this country was built
by people who work very hard.
Not everyone
has everything handed to them.
Not like some rich kids
whose fathers own Metzler Cement-
- and give them trucks
and throw them big parties.
They don't ever have to work hard.
They just waltz right in -
- and take what other people have
worked hard for all their lives.
No, it didn't bother me at all.
Paul Power.
Paul for president.
Promise, progress, peanut.
- What?
- I told you. I can't.
It just doesn't feel right anymore.
But I love you.
I said, no!
- Tammy, guess what happened today?
- Don't you fucking knock?
- Hi, Lisa.
- Get out, Paul.
- Mr McAllister tells me...
- I've got to go.
- You dumb shit!
- What did I do?
It's not like I'm a lesbian.
I'm attracted to the person.
It's just seem to
only be attracted to girls.
Lisa, wait.
Stop!
- Where are you going?
- I'm not like you.
- What do you mean?
- I'm not a dyke. We're not in love.
We're just... experimenting.
How can something that seemed
so true turn out to be such a lie?
Lisa and I
were destined to be together.
Of all the people on the planet,
somehow we found each other.
It was like a miracle.
We had so much fun together.
Like the time we ate asparagus -
- to see how long it takes
before your pee smells funny.
It was very scientific. For me it
was 11 minutes, for her it was 17.
Every day I found a new way
to tell Lisa how much I loved her.
If you died, I'd dive into
one of my dad's cement trucks -
- and get poured into your tomb.
But the closer we got,
the more she pulled away.
Are you crazy.
These are private. These are for us.
- Other people can see them here.
- I don't care.
I do!
What did I do to make her change?
What's wrong with me?
Sometimes when I'm sad,
I sit and watch the power station.
They say that if you lie between the
main wires, your body evaporates.
You become a gas.
I wonder what that would feel like.
Lisa decided
that she wanted to hurt me.
And she knew exactly what to do.
Lisa Flannigan asked me for a
ride home and ended up blowing me.
I've wanted this for so long.
Life is so weird.
Lisa has a fight with my sister, -
- and the next thing you know
she's my girlfriend.
She offered to help with the
public relations for my campaign.
We made a great team. It seemed
so natural, the two of us together.
It was like a miracle.
My leg was okay
and the weather was so nice.
After school, we'd go to Lisa's
house to fuck and have a hot tub.
If that's the way they wanted it,
that's how it would be.
But I wasn't going down
without a fight.
Tammy, what are you doing?
Stop her. She's not qualified.
She's just a sophomore.
Calm down.
Can we both run?
We're brother and sister.
- It's a conflict of interest.
- She got her signatures in.
These are a bunch of burn-outs.
This one is illegible.
Tim Cobzer.
- She wants to get back at me.
- For what?
- I mean, at you.
- For what?
Tim Cobzer?
I've never even heard of him.
We'll have the assembly tomorrow.
Everyone can make their speeches.
- You're scaring him.
- He likes it... Not that much.
Around that time, Diane and I
were seeing a lot of Linda Novotny.
Giving her love and support
and helping her in a difficult time.
We really wanted to have kids, but
there was always a reason to wait.
She had to finish nursing school,
I had to get my masters...
Finally, we decided to go for it.
Are you going to do it?
For over a year
we hadn't had any luck.
Come on, do it. Fill me up.
Come on. Fill me up.
Fill me up.
Okay.
Good job.
Jim, can you get this?
- Yeah, sure.
- Just put it on the table.
Linda needed a lot of help
around the house.
- Here?
- No, more this way.
- Here?
- Yeah, that's good.
I'd always liked Linda,
but we'd never been alone together.
With Dave out of the picture,
I began to see how great she was.
We got to be kind of buddies.
Once I even took her to the mall.
- What do you think?
- You look great.
- I can't afford this stuff now.
- You've had a hard year.
You're cooped up all the time
with the kid. Live a little.
- Should we get a room?
- Should we get a what?
That's not funny.
- How did it go?
- Fine. We just went to Westfoods.
- Did you guys have fun?
- Yeah.
- I mean, you know...
- What?
Linda's great, but she can be
a little bit much sometimes.
God, just like that. Yeah.
Fill me up.
Yeah, fill me up!
God, just like that.
Yeah, fill me up.
God, just like that.
Do it, Jim. Fuck me.
Do it, Jim. Just like that.
Fill me up.
Just like that. Do it, Mr M.
Fuck me.
Fuck me hard, Mr McAllister.
Harder.
Fuck me harder, please.
My life was going pretty well-
- until things started going haywire
with that damn election.
I love Carver High and I will
be a dedicated vice-president.
Vote for Jerry Slavin
and good government.
Even if I can't really
stand up for you, I will.
Thank you.
Thank you. Jerry is running
unopposed for vice-president.
We'll move on now to
the three presidential candidates.
The first, in alphabetical order,
is Tracy Flick.
Henry David Thoreau once wrote:
"I cannot make my days longer,
so I strive to make them better."
At Carver we have an opportunity
to make our school days better.
During this campaign,
I've heard many of your concerns.
Eliza Ramirez says she feels
alienated from her own homeroom.
Reggie Banks, whose mother
works in the cafeteria -
- and can't afford to buy him books.
- Eat me.
- Eat me raw.
If you can't be adults, and give
these candidates some courtesy, -
- you don't deserve
to be called adults, but children.
And you'll be treated like children.
Let's all listen up.
I care about Carver
and about each and every one of you.
Together we can make a difference.
Cast your vote for Tracy Flick,
and you won't just be voting for me.
You'll be voting for yourself
and every other student at Carver.
Our days might not be any longer
but they can sure be better.
The next candidate is Paul Metzler.
When I broke my leg this year,
it made me re-evaluate my life.
I want to help people
and this school.
It's our second home,
where we grow as individuals.
I want our school
to reach its true potential.
That's why I'm running
for president. I can fight hard.
Like when I threw the fourth-quarter
pass that beat Westside.
I won't let you down. We can all
score a winning touchdown together.
Vote Paul Metzler for President.
Thank you.
The final presidential candidate
is another of the Metzler clan.
Tammy Metzler.
People!
Who cares
about this stupid election?
We all know it doesn't matter
who gets elected president.
Do you really think
it's going to change anything?
Will it make one single person
smarter, happier or nicer?
The only person it matters to
is the one who gets elected.
The same pathetic charade
happens every year.
Just so someone gets to put
it on their college transcript.
Vote for me.
I don't even want to go to college.
As president, I won't do anything.
The only promise I'll make is to
dismantle the student government -
- so we'll never have
another of these stupid assemblies.
Tammy! Tammy!
Or don't vote for me.
Who cares? Don't vote at all.
Close the door.
That bitch made a fool out of us.
I want her out of this election.
Getting everyone all riled up.
She's washed up. Finished.
We can't stop her just because
we don't like her speech.
Yeah, whatever. But she's a
troublemaker. She's on my list.
All we need to do is send a message.
We should just suspend her.
That's it!
She's suspended for three days.
Suspension is like a vacation.
Why do they think it's a punishment?
If your dog pees on the carpet,
do you give him a treat?
Then you get into trouble
for skipping school.
Hendricks said next time I'd be
expelled. It sounded good to me.
Hi, Tammy.
- What do you want?
- I got all your assignments.
Last time you got suspended
you fell so far behind.
- Thanks a lot, Paul.
- Sure, you bet.
- Now could you leave me alone?
- Yeah.
There's just one other thing.
All this election stuff...
Everyone's saying it's really weird
you're running against me.
You never really told me
why you're doing it.
But that's okay.
I respect your privacy.
I want you to know that no matter
who wins, there's no hard feelings.
We're still brother and sister,
even though you're adopted.
I hope you feel the same.
What happened at the speeches
was a travesty.
That little bitch isn't going
to make a fool out of me.
If all those cheering students
only knew how hard I worked.
The nights spent on the yearbook,
giving them their stinking memories.
I had to clean up the group photos.
A cinch with our new software.
People are so ungrateful.
The day before the election, things
started to get really complicated.
There's your culprit.
Linda had asked me to stop by
to help with a plumbing problem.
- Did you know Dave's a bed-wetter?
- No, I didn't know that.
All his life.
He's tried everything.
- Is that still running clear?
- Yeah.
Better let it run for a while.
Wait.
Here, this one's clean.
I guess you'd better get to work.
You're going to be late.
Thank you, Jim.
It just happened.
Neither of us planned it.
But once we started,
we knew there was no turning back.
It was a miracle.
- Take me to that motel.
- Now?
Come by after school.
I'll leave Darryl with a sitter.
- 3:25.
- Okay, 3:25.
What had blossomed between Linda
and me was too powerful to deny.
For the first time in years,
I felt free and alive.
- It's not fair.
- Who would do something like that?
It must be a mistake,
like a maintenance thing.
- Where the hell have you been?
- Nowhere.
- I don't teach until second period.
- I tried you at home.
If Paul loses,
we want another election.
- Somebody tore down their posters.
- They cost us a lot of money.
- We'll get to the bottom of it.
- We still have some extra ones.
- It was Tammy.
- She wouldn't do that.
That speech she gave,
it was out there.
We'll get to the bottom of it.
You two focus on your studies.
Mr McAllister will handle
the whole thing. Right, Jim?
What's that?
Sure, you bet.
Tracy.
Tracy, come on in.
Close the door behind you.
Have a seat.
You know why you're here.
If it's about the posters,
I think it's a travesty.
A travesty? That's interesting...
because I think you did it.
What?
Are you accusing me?
We've worked together
for three solid years.
My own banner was torn down, too.
Were you in the Looking Glass
office over the weekend?
I was. Mr Pecharda let me in.
With my many responsibilities
I have to come in on the weekend.
- I left early, around 6:30.
- 6:30?
How do you know what time
the posters were torn down?
I don't,
but they were there when I left.
I'm giving you helpful information.
We should be trying to figure out
who did this.
Okay, who do you think did it?
Whom should we interrogate?
It could have been any of the
subversive elements at Carver.
Like Rick Thieson
and those burn-outs.
What about Tammy Metzler?
She's anti this and anti that.
You're a very intelligent girl,
with a lot of admirable qualities.
But being smart and doing whatever
you need to do to get ahead -
- and stepping on other people...
There's more to life than that.
You're only cheating yourself.
Why are you lecturing me?
This isn't the time or the place
to get into it.
But for one example,
a certain former colleague of mine-
- made a very big mistake.
I think the lesson here
is that we all make mistakes.
We have to learn that our actions
can carry serious consequences.
Maybe if certain
older, wiser people -
- hadn't acted like little babies,
then everything would be okay.
I agree. And certain young
and naive people -
- should thank their lucky stars -
- that the entire school didn't find
out about certain indiscretions -
- that could have ruined their
chances to win certain elections.
Certain older people shouldn't
be leching after their students.
Some can't even
get their own wives pregnant.
And slanderous accusations shouldn't
be made to young, naive people -
- whose mothers are paralegal
secretaries in successful law firms.
If you want to keep questioning me,
I want my attorney present.
- You wanted to see me?
- Wait outside, Tammy.
- Is this about the posters?
- Possibly. Wait outside.
Okay, because I know who did it.
So I'll just be outside.
Don't go anywhere, Tracy.
Tammy, come in here.
This ought to be good.
What do you have to tell me?
This is hard for me,
but it's important to be honest.
- What is it, Tammy?
- I tore down Paul's posters.
- I did it.
- When did you do it?
Yesterday. Sunday.
- How did you get in?
- The door was open.
- Which door?
- I don't know. But I did it.
- I don't believe you.
- I have proof.
Tracy, it looks like today
is your lucky day.
You're off the hook.
Tammy here has confessed.
I told you.
You're going to pay for my poster.
Okay, easy now.
Quit while you're ahead.
The rest of the day was unbearable.
I kept smelling Linda on my clothes.
I couldn't wait to get out of there.
I wanted everything to be perfect
at the motel.
I decided to give myself some time
to prepare during eighth period.
Pop-quiz, everybody.
Put your stuff away. If you've done
your reading this should be easy.
I had 48 minutes to arrange it all.
If you finish early, sit quietly.
I'll be right back.
Okay everybody, pass them forward.
Stephanie, put your pen down.
See you on Wednesday.
Don't forget to vote tomorrow.
Linda.
Linda!
Jesus!
Oh, fuck!
You've reached the Novotny's.
We'll call you back real soon.
Linda, it's me.
If you're there, pick up.
It's 4:32.
I came by at 3:25, like we said.
I waited there,
but you weren't there.
I'm at the place we talked about.
Suite 246.
And I'm here.
Everything is all set.
So I hope you get here soon.
Bye-bye.
I just don't get it.
What you have against your mother
and me and Paul is beyond me.
Your mother's upset,
she's at the end of a rope.
Your behaviour keeps getting
crazier and wilder.
Who knows
what the hell else you're doing!
I just had a long conversation
with Walt Hendricks.
I phoned him at home.
He doesn't want you back at Carver.
He's fed up with you.
And I don't blame him.
What?
Tammy, your father and I
have come to a decision.
You're going to Immaculate Heart.
Maybe the nuns
will be able to straighten you out.
Is that funny?
Okay.
Dear Lord Jesus,
I do not often ask you for things -
- but I must insist you
help me win the election tomorrow.
I deserve it and
Paul Metzler doesn't, as you know.
I realise it was your divine hand
that disqualified Tammy Metzler.
Make sure you put me in office,
so that I may carry out your will.
Amen.
God, I don't believe in you, but
I'm practising for Catholic school.
What do I want?
I want Lisa to realise what a bitch
she is and to apologise to me.
I want Paul to win the election
tomorrow, not that cunt Tracy.
I also want a pair
of expensive leather pants.
And someday I want to be
really good friends with Madonna.
Dear God, you've given me
so many things.
Good health,
nice parents, a nice truck -
- and what I'm told
is a large penis. I'm grateful.
But I'm worried about Tammy. I can't
believe she tore down my posters.
But sometimes she gets so angry.
Help her be a happier person.
She's so smart and sensitive,
and I love her so much.
I'm nervous
about the election tomorrow.
I want to win,
but I know it's totally up to you.
You'll decide
who the best person is.
Forgive me for my sins,
whatever they may be. Amen.
Linda never came home. I waited
outside her house for ten hours.
Oh, God.
On election day, my mum and I
customised 480 cupcakes.
Good morning, Mr M.
It looks like you
could use a cupcake.
What happened to your eye?
Are you okay?
"Mr McAllister, somebody tore down
my poster. It's not fair."
"Can I have an A?
Can I have a recommendation?"
Fuck them.
You've reached the Novotny's.
We'll call you back soon.
Why did you do that?
I trusted you completely.
You ruined my life,
do you realise that? Do you?
You ruined my life.
Is that what you wanted?
I'm sorry, I'm going nuts here.
I really think we should talk.
It's Jim. I love you.
We have an important announcement
from our principal, Dr Hendricks.
Good morning, students.
It behoves me to inform you
of a change in today's election.
Tammy Metzler has been determined
ineligible for SGA President.
All other candidates are eligible,
but not Tammy Metzler.
When the time came to vote,
I stood in line like everyone else.
- Hi, Tracy.
- Tracy Enid Flick.
- Ready, Phil?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
Thanks, Phil.
Hey, Tracy.
Isn't this exciting?
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks, Paul.
- You, too.
- Thanks.
It's so weird. Do people
always vote for themselves?
Looking at my own name...
I don't know... I just felt like
it's not right to vote for yourself.
Okay, Mr M.
- Let's start counting.
- Okay, I'll do the first count.
You can do
one of the two independent counts.
Fine. Start with the president,
and I'll be right back.
You have the key.
Right.
- Are you okay?
- What happened to your eye?
I'm fine. It's just a simple,
little, everyday bee sting.
Some people get stung,
it's no big deal. Me, I swell up.
I'm pressed for time. I have other
things going on too, you know?
Yeah, okay.
We know.
All right, I'll be right back.
You've reached the Novotny's.
We'll call you back real soon.
It's me again.
I'm sorry for all the messages.
If I could just hear your voice.
If you'd only acknowledge...
- What do you want, Jim?
- You're there.
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Linda, I love you.
- You know that's not true.
- It's the only true thing I know.
- We made a mistake.
- That was no mistake.
- You took advantage of me.
- I took advantage of you?
You hugged me. You kissed me.
You're the one...
- Mr M, big day.
- Not now, Paul.
- What have you got?
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- You've got to make your count.
- You're kidding, right?
I thought those were the rules.
If they've changed...
We're not electing the fucking Pope.
Just tell me who won.
It's a squeaker. I've got Tracy
by a vote. Just one vote.
Mr M...
Well, okay...
I guess I'd better do my count.
At the end of my count, I had
exactly the same numbers as Larry.
256 to 257. Tracy had won
the election by a single vote.
I was about
to announce my tally when...
The sight of Tracy affected me
in a way I can't fully explain.
Part of it was that
she was spying...
But mostly it was her face.
Who knew how far she'd go in life,
how much suffering she'd cause?
I had to stop her... Now.
Larry...
I think we have a problem.
253, 245, 255.
I get the same as you, Jim.
Paul's our next president.
- It doesn't make sense.
- We both get the same figures.
256 for Paul.
255 for Tracy.
- And 290 disregards.
- Mostly Tammy fans.
It doesn't add up. There were
801 ballots, but 803 people voted.
- There must be two votes missing.
- Two people pocketed their ballots.
They were there.
I counted 803 votes.
- People make mistakes.
- I didn't.
- They were there when you sat down.
- I don't like where you're going.
- Every vote was accounted for.
- That's enough. End of story.
I just want to let you know
that no matter how this turns out -
- you've run a great campaign.
Good luck.
Thanks, Tracy.
I'm just glad it's over.
Let's get started. When the winners
are announced, we can all go home.
In a contest so well fought
it seems unfair to have a winner.
Act surprised.
Walk slowly to the podium.
Be modest. Thank them
for this incredible honour.
They're all highly qualified
and embody the integrity -
- that we expect
from the school leadership.
The point of an election is to
choose a winner. That you have done.
We'll begin with the president.
This was
an extraordinarily close race.
I'd like to announce the next
president of Carver High School:
Paul Metzler.
Jeez, you guys, thanks!
Thanks. I promise to do my best.
I'll be a good president.
Mr M is over there.
This is so wild. We came here
to celebrate my victory.
This is great.
These are my parents.
- Dick Metzler.
- Jim McAllister.
Paul thinks the world of you.
He goes on and on.
You've really helped him out.
Paul doesn't need any help from me.
You should be very proud.
- We are.
- Come over and join us.
I'm just finishing up.
I've got to get home.
Why don't you guys go sit down.
- I want to talk to Mr M.
- That sounds great.
- It was sure nice to meet you.
- And thank you.
I have some ideas
about what we could do.
We could have a carnival with rides,
for muscular dystrophy.
On Halloween we could have
a haunted house, a really good one.
Not like those cheesy, bad ones.
Super scary.
For homecoming... Last year's theme
was heaven on earth.
- This year...
- We can talk about this later.
Right now, I need to finish my pie
and go on home.
Okay. Sorry.
Just one more thing:
Do you think Tracy will be okay?
I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Don't worry about Tracy.
She'll be fine.
Oh, sweetheart...
Baby.
Oh, baby...
Take one of my pills.
You'll feel better.
Here.
Come on, baby.
Lie down.
That's a good girl.
Lie down. Good girl.
That's it, baby.
That's it, honey.
Maybe you needed
more posters, honey.
Or if you'd taken my suggestions
about your speech...
I don't know, we'll figure it out.
Diane... I've made a mistake.
Did you want the same room?
Yeah, okay.
The next day, I resolved
to get my life back on track.
The way I saw it, getting kicked out
of the house was a good thing.
It was an opportunity. We needed
a little time to work things out.
The election was behind me.
The worst was over.
What harm had really been done?
Nobody was dead.
Jim, Walt wants to see you.
Okay, thanks.
You rang?
Mr McAllister, I hope you can
help us clear something up.
- I.
- Am.
- They.
- Are.
Thank you.
Signor Presedente,
they want to see you in the office.
Dr Hendricks?
Come on in, son. We have something
hard we have to tell you.
- Is it about Tammy?
- It's about the election.
After Paul got the bad news,
Walt asked for a word with me.
It was simple. I offered
my resignation, and he accepted.
Very quietly, it was all over
for Jim McAllister at Carver High.
Suddenly everyone knew who I was.
The teacher who tried to crush
the dreams of an innocent girl.
All the good things I'd ever done
in my life evaporated.
The wire services
picked up on the story.
It was the kind of absurd news item
that people talk about at work.
Diane started divorce proceedings.
She was completely unforgiving.
She took almost everything,
including the house.
I got the car.
I realised it was time to get out
of Omaha and move on.
Senior year was great. I didn't get
to play ball or be president-
- but I got elected homecoming king.
I got into Nebraska like I wanted.
At the end of the year, I threw
a Mexican party at the cement plant.
Shit, that was a good party!
The only bad thing was Lisa.
She dumped me.
One minute we're in love,
the next she goes after Randy.
I wonder what would have happened
if I'd won the election.
Would my whole life be different?
Would I never have gone to Yosemite?
Or maybe I'd be dead.
Catholic school was great.
The teachers kind of sucked,
and were supposedly strict.
But you could get away with murder.
The best thing about
Immaculate Heart was Jennifer.
Jennifer and I are soulmates.
We're never going to be apart.
Order! Order!
Senior year was very productive.
I was in the top seventh percentile
of my graduating class.
I got into Georgetown
like I wanted... with scholarships.
Sometimes I got lonely and I'd think
about Dave. I missed our talks.
Maybe it could have worked out.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Maybe he finally finished his novel.
I had a myriad of accomplishments
and a bright future -
- but I just didn't feel right.
Everybody else seems so happy,
signing each other's yearbooks.
Hardly anybody signed mine.
As president, you'd think
I'd be surrounded by friends.
As far as Mr McAllister
was concerned, -
- I hardly thought about him at all.
Nobody had heard from him.
It was like he'd never existed.
Tracy Enid Flick.
At Georgetown, I thought I'd finally
be among people more like me.
I was sure that finally
I'd make some true friends.
Excuse me, will you please be quiet!
It wasn't like that at all. They
were just spoiled little rich kids.
I've come to accept that very few
people are destined to be special.
We're solo flyers.
It really is like Dave said:
If you're going to be great,
you've got to be lonely.
What happens to a man
when he loses everything?
Everything he's worked for.
Everything he believes in.
Driven from his home.
Cast out of society.
How can he survive?
Where can he go?
Right this way.
New York City.
For centuries people have come
to New York seeking refuge.
Now I am one of them. I'd always
dreamed of living in New York.
All that excitement and culture.
Life is full of surprises.
Once in a while,
I even bump into former students.
My apartment is a little small
and the rent is pretty steep, -
- but it's got character,
and I'm cosy enough.
And it's great not needing a car.
I get to read on the subway.
Some days, I even walk to work.
The job market is tight,
but after hunting around a while -
- I landed a job in the education
department at the museum.
I'm teaching again.
When a school brings its students
to the museum on a field trip, -
- there's a staff of trained
educators to greet them.
I've started seeing someone new.
Jillian.
She works at the museum, too.
She's really different from Diane.
I've never met anyone like her.
She just ended a relationship, too,
so we're trying to take it slow.
You might ask if I ever saw
Tracy Flick again. I did, just once.
I was down in Washington for
a museum educators' conference.
After an inspiring morning
on the Mall, -
- I was on my way
to the Holocaust Museum, when...
I'll never know if she saw me.
Probably not.
But just then, all the bad memories,
everything I'd wanted to tell her, -
- it all came flooding back.
I wanted to run over there and
tell her I knew about the posters.
And how she'd cheated her way
into winning that election.
But instead, I just stood there.
I realised I wasn't angry at her
anymore. I just felt sorry for her.
When I think about my new life,
and what her life must be like...
She probably still gets up early to
pursue her pathetic little dreams.
Where is she
really trying to get to anyway?
What is she doing in that limo?
Who the fuck does she think she is?
Hey, you!
You asshole!
That's all ancient history now.
I've got a whole new life.
That's what's great about America.
You can always start over.
Would that make this
an igneous or a sedimentary rock?
What's the difference
between igneous and sedimentary?
Anybody?
