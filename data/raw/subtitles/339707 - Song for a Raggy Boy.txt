And be quicker, try to finish
before the day of judgment
Remember guys Jesus always

What is cleanliness, 913;
What brings us closer to the lord
Then what is that
stain on the ground
Pick it up and take it to the laundry room
- Yes sir
Adagio !
One moment I arrive...
Mr. Frenklin right
- Yes.
Yes of course come in
It would take a coat of paint
Welcome
- Thank you
I hope it is to your liking
The bathroom is located over there
at the end of the hallway
-In case you need it.
-What part of the school is this ?
Here used to be the cells where
political prisoners were locked up
But today day thank God
they are out of use
I hope you will be comfortable here with us
Mr. Frenklin
I hope so, too
You are the first lay teacher
we have here, and God knows
there is a need for change
Well I go so you can settle
-Good night
-God bless you
If you'd like, you can have a cup
of tea in the kitchen
Be good and obey
to Father Marc
And remember what I told you
Behave well and you'll be out in
a blink of an eye
Patrick Deleni is you right ?
- Yes
You must serve 2 years and 6 months
Missed school 35 times
Caught stealing 5 times
-How old are you?
-Thirteen and a half
Well you're not a saint, as a record
it's not bad at all for your age
From now on your name is 743.
Each one of you is assigned
a number , do not forget it
You stay composed
Did you sleep well ?
- Very well thank you
Allow me to introduce you to
our father superior
-Father Demi Mr. Frenklin
-Good morning Mr. Frenklin
-Nice to meet you
-Welcome to St. Jude's
Mr. Frenklin it is my duty to remind you.
that your morning class
is at 9:00 a.m. sharp
Yes but father demien took me
to visit the school
I heard that he once taught
in a public school
-A long time ago.
-And then what did he do ?
I traveled to open my mind
Do you find it a useful thing ?
-No
Let me give you some advice
When he faces them...
..do not make the mistake...
...to confuse these creatures
with intelligent human beings
The only thing I am able to understand
is the strength
So if he won't use it with them....
...they will eat it alive
I thank you for the advice but I think
I'll be able to manage
guys up come in
Choose a bench and
sit down
I am your new teacher
Professor Frenklin
This is my first day at St. Jude's.
And I also don't want it to be the last
So if you are going to
to create problems for me I suggest you
to say so now
Well , I hear no objection
I am good and dear but that does not
allows you to have illusions
Or eyes even in the back of the head
Any questions ?
-His Name
-458, Peters
On your feet Mr. Peters
-What's someone like you doing in a place like this?
-What do you think?
My guess is that he hasn't
found another job
Sit down Peters , are there
more serious questions ?
-You still haven't answered the first one
-I'm here to teach a job I believe in.
And now I want to make some things clear right away.
clear a few things, first you will call each other
by name
According to the reasons why you are here
do not concern me
My only interest is that inside
this classroom you study and learn
Third.
...you can ask me any question
and I will try to answer them
If I won't be able to
I will tell you it's all clear ;
Mr. Peter open the book
Stand up and
start reading
-What's so funny
-She can't read sir
-How is it possible
-Nobody taught him that is why.
-What's his name
-Liam Mersery
Standing
-Can you read ?
-Yes and also write
-I'd like you to teach it to Peters.
-Why should I ?
Good point now
sit down and think about it
Which of the others can read and write ?
Raise your hand
There is no shame
Well there's no need to stand around twiddling
thumbs
Look, here are two grains missing
undo it and do it right
Be more careful
All right Rogers go ahead
Hush hush, come on
Tell me about the books you've read
-They were stolen
-Have you ever read a book that was not stolen ?
Clear
- It is said yes
- Yes sir
And where did you find them ?
Home to an old man who was
upstairs
What did you learn from those books ?
Nothing
Nothing ?
What were the books ?
Junk
Take some of mine if
it pleases you then tell me if you
find them junk or not
Page 21,
Mercie loud and clear please
Don't come crying to my
grave, I am not the
I am not sleeping, I am
in the thousand winds that blow
are in the reflection of
diamond of the snow
are in the sunbeams of the
ripe wheat
Are in the soft autumn rain
When you wake up in the silent
morning I am the swift hovering
Of birds
Drawing rings in the sky
Sona the pale star
That shines in the night
Don't come and cry on
my grave I am not the
because I am not dead
I brought her some chalks I
don't use them anymore
Thank you father
That's Liam Mercei's
-A boy out of the ordinary
-Yes, he is a lively intelligence
- Where are the parents ?
-When he arrived he was 10 years old
The mother had died a few
years earlier
His father never came to
visit him
For her, what will happen to the boy ?
Well knowing him the only
career that lies ahead for him is
that of the scoundrel
-Hopefully not
-Anyway if and will go soon as everyone
Nothing lasts forever
Thank God it is so
743.
Do you know that there are
rules on this wall ?
- No sir
Then I'll expose them to you, I'll do it
one time and I have no
intention of repeating myself
Do I make myself clear ?
- Yes, sir.
This wall was built
to a purpose
The purpose is for you older
older ones stay on this side
And the younger ones stay on the other
It is forbidden to touch it with hands
or feet is forbidden to lean against it
It is forbidden to scribble it down
especially to idle punks like you
Have I explained myself ?
- Yes, sir.
I want to explain it better
On both sides of the wall is
a red line
None of you are allowed
to cross it for any reason whatsoever
If this happened by accident
or intentionally...
...It will be my care that the culprit
is put in a position not to
do it again
Is everything clear to you now ?
Yes sir
Well get out of the way and don't
ever forget
I'll show you , go all the way down
like this, and a line down the middle
Mercier. Standing
- It's his fault
-He heard me say "on his feet."
By Fr. Jhon
-How many to 100 ?
-Few ladies
-How many?
-A couple ladies
Let us stop here, and may it
serve as a lesson to you
In the name of the father of the son
and of the holy spirit amen
-Mercier, what happened to you?
-According to you ! I fell sir
Discipline is my business
Mr. Franklin
And it's my specific responsibility that
kids understand the
meaning
Do you have any idea of the pain one feels
being hit in the face ?
Every form of disorder must
be nipped in the bud
There are better ways to
educate children
You're just a teacher here
Mr. Frenklin and you're new to it.
Let me give you some advice
If he cares about staying in
this institution...
...do not meddle in matters that
do not concern you
Here we go guys up that way
side move
Up come courage boys
Even on that side on
- On more ingenuity guys
Very good Delein
-You know I see you Dauni
-Excuse me Father Mac
When I entered the order
I was their age
- Really
My father could not afford
to pay for my studies
So he sent me to the seminary
I came here 2 years after ordination
before that I was living in Dublin
-And did you like Dublin ?
-No too noisy
And also too crowded
Why did you choose the institute ?
Here I can serve God
The artenative was the missions
but honestly I'm not suited
for that life
Fortunately, the superiors have
accepted
I see her Donei
Who dared ?
Who allowed himself to do
this crap ?
Was it you ?
I asked you a question 743,
were you ?
No
He is really overreacting
I told him.
Mr. Frenklin!
He shouldn't have meddled he
made a big mistake
Get up , get up guys!
- Out of bed
On your feet, 849!
All rise, 658!
Come on hurry up !
Extend those arms, 855.
Stand up straight, 7 43,
or I will make you regret it
And remember.
You have to thank Mr.
Frenklin for this midnight gathering.
Rest
In the dormitory
''I will not yield, I
I will not die.''
-''I will eat dynamite...''
-And one day I will explode like a volcano.
-Are you talking to yourself Mercier ?
-You tell him to read aloud.
Can I borrow it ?
-Yes , what are you doing with it ?
-You asked me yesterday
And the door was open
Yesterday or yes there are books
to take to class
Did you fight in Spain, sir ?
- Yes.
-Whose side were you on?
-What do you know about the Spanish War.
What Fr. John told us
about communists
That they burned down churches
and killed priests, are you a
communist Mr. Frenklin ?
The war in Spain was among those who
had the land by divine right....
...and those who wanted to give it
to the peasants do you understand what
it means ?  - Yes.
Just now he was reading a poem about the civil war.
what do you think ?
That says what I feel
''I will not yield I will not die''
''I will eat'' dynamite and one
I will explode like a volcano one day
What does it mean to you ?
I will fight the rotters who are
against me like you in Spain
Don't expect too much Mercier the
life can be very unfair
It says ?
-Mercier ! books
-Why did you stop Father Jhon yesterday?
Sometimes you have to stand up for what you
in which one believes
It was worse for us
What do you plan to do ?
Tell Father John ?
Come on Mercier continue !
-What else did he say ?
-That he went to Spain and
fought with the communists
-And who are the communists?
-Those who do not believe in God.
Think Frenklin with a gun
''I'll kill you Jhon without mercy!''
Mr. Frenklin influences
negatively on the boys
Mr. Frenklin is a teacher
excellent brother Jhon
Perhaps he has some difficulty in
adapting to the school's methods
-I'll talk to him about it and he'll see that ...
-No he has to leave father
-The Bible tells us.
-I know what the bible teaches father.
It is my duty before God to protect
those children from corruption and from the
evils of the world
Of which Mr. Frenklin is
soaked to the bone
He may have questioned
his authority but she wants to crush him
you know brother Jhon sometimes I wonder
how the church has survived
to this day
She survived through the power of Jesus
Christ
I ask you for the last time, do you want to
or do you not want to fire Mr. Frenklin
let's take a picture guys
soon come on
Dai Rosa throws the flowers
The disturbance Mr. Frenklin
No not at all father
I will be frank with you
He antagonized Brother Jhon
It was unwise to question
his authority in front of the boys
-know why I did it ?
-That's not the point
He is the prefect here is the
guarantor of disipline
And what should I do ?
Stand there quietly and watch as he
taking boys with belts in the face ?
-But there are various ways to deal with things.
-And how to ignore them
For years I have wanted to improve the methods
educational methods of this institution
It's not easy but I don't despair of
succeed
I did not appoint myself prefect
Brother Jhon
I wanted Brother Tom, but the
bishop decided otherwise
I have to adjust and so does she
-On Peters begins.
-I don't give a damn about
reading and writing
-You are such a fool.
-What are you going to do when you get out of here ?
I will certainly have a good time
in your face
-And if you want to forge a check ?
-I know the numbers I know what's the point
-You are hopeless
-Do you know where the money is?
- Sure, do you?
They are on the books of the banks
you can steal it millions
- And who says so ?
-I say it and the scammers
guys with the shiny shoes , the
clean shirt and the smart jacket
and with bank accounts in
all over the world
- What about this ?
If you want to become one of them
you must be able to read and write
Otherwise you're out
and outside you're dead
-Are you sure ?
-Guaranteed
What a pallid future
I'm in
Repeat after me
No no go ahead
Please don't suggest Donei
Good good
Don't shout
Good boy good boy
You did well
Bravo bravo
Bravo I have something for you
Look I have a present for you
look
You did well
And now you know what you have to do keep
your mouth shut
Can I go to the bathroom now father ?
Yes son
Wait let me show you
When you make the "r" round it off
Perfect
As you know the next
is the first Friday of the month....
...and Father Odriscol has returned from the
holiday mission
will be here so that
you can confess
I want you all to do an
examination of conscience...
...to prepare you for a
good confession
Thank you brother Willan
Now get back to work
Then he took me to the bathroom
He pulled it out and put it in my
put it in my hand
Then he started to move it
back and forth
until it got hard
then he it me face to the wall
I didn't want to do that
He pulled down my pants...
...and stuck it in me.
It hurt me so much
I tried to scream but he
kept my hand over my mouth
He said I was good
But I feel bad now
What you have just told me
must not come out of this confessional
-Did you understand correctly ?
-Yes father
In the name of the Father of the Son and the
Holy Spirit Amen
Deleni
What did I tell you ?
I told you to keep
your mouth shut
This morning our
ambassador in Berlin.
... delivered to the
German government an ultimatum ...
...according to which if by 11:00 a.m.
there had been no communication received
official...
...of an immediate withdrawal of the
German from the territory of the Polish state....
...our 2 countries would
entered the war
since no
communication to that effect...
...as of this moment our country
is at war with Germany
you can imagine what a hard blow
is for me...
... having to admit the failure of
my long battle for peace
I firmly believe that between
Germany and Poland...
... it would have been possible to arrive at an
honorable and peaceful settlement of the conflict
So it's war Mr. Frenklin
All out boast !
Back to bed you go back to bed there is
there is nothing to see !
Everyone bunk away from the windows !
You have already updated it
You see yesterday was an
important England has
declared war on Germany
And now Europe is at war
again
Today we will discuss what is
war
Donei you begin
war is when 2 countries
fight...
...And each country sends its army
against each other
Merchandise
War is when soldiers
kill and people die
Yes it is so sit down
She let me down
Yes it's true and I'm sorry father
I trusted her
I am not Jesus Christ
And I have no answers to give
What you have Mr. Frenklin is
the gift of teaching
My only gift is to
to disappoint people as it has been
with her
Now if you will permit I will go and
pack my luggage
I am not firing her unless
she doesn't want to leave
Do you want to leave us Mr. Frenklin ?
- No.
-I don't want to
-Well
There is so much to do
Be good don't get rowdy
Where did you learn to carry it ?
- I go fast is
Get on, andi let us get on....
Slowly guys
Be careful with that rake Linch
St. Jude's are ugly and crooked
Those at St. Just's are half-black
Those at San Just are strays
the dogs of the San Just
What is a challenge well there they are
Bring it on
San Just people are ugly and crooked
Apparently you only know how to talk
Yes to slaps
Go fuck yourselves and
see that you grow up!
For Christmas we were asked to
to build a nativity scene
Father Demien is counting on us
do you have any ideas in your head ?
Mr. Rogers since I see you so
enthusiastic about the project
-What do you suggest ?
-Let's put the sheep
Mr. Linch ?
He will serve Jesus Mary and Joseph
She Mercie what ideas are swirling in
that hard head of hers
I would say don't put it
On the altar I would put it on one side
We could make the cave out of wood
And cover it with papier mache so it will look like
of stone
The star can be made of paper with
the light behind
And we could paint Bethlehem
in the background and the blue sky
And finally you can put some
fake snow all over the place
Here's what I would do
Thank you Deleni
Any objections ?
- No sir no
Then to work
Poor Deleni
Now you will be happy Rogers !
I don't center swear that I didn't
I said anything
''Spy to no centers you said nothing.''
Bullshit you are a shit spy Rogers !
You blurted out to him that he wet the bed!
Give this
bastard so make him black
What's going on !
Mercie leave him alone
Leave it !
I'm going to kill you scum !
Get out !
You are a dead man Rogers !
Go to the bathroom and rinse your nose
- Thank you sir
Out !
By me
Jesus Christ Mercier !
I thought you had a brain in your head !
Instead you are harder than
this fucking wall !
-You don't give a damn about anyone.
you only think about you
- Are you finished then ?
No I haven't finished yet !
Do you want to get out of here or not
And when you get out what are you going to do
-I can go now
-That's all you have to say.
Now I can go
Va a fan culo !
You want to tell me something else
you understand this is
743.
It goes ahead
-Are you going to apologize ?
-And you ?
Chapter 27, Mercier
''I approach the door and strained my ear.

''Then on tiptoe and
holding my breath.''
I go down to the ground floor and approach
to the door and tense

To Leon Mercier from his friend
William Frenklin
Merry Christmas, 1939
I miss my brother
Knock it off and sleep Peters
Merry Christmas Shon
Merry Christmas Jerry
I wish dad was here
- Yeah, me too
This is a shameful thing....
...shameful and repugnant when the
behavior of a boy descends to the
level of a beast
kneeling
It is an affront to God that leads
the soul to damnation
Look carefully and remember
well what you will see
This punishment is just the beginning
The eternal ones are in the hands of
Almighty God...
...and they will be more terrible than
anything you can imagine
Search for Franklin , move
He is whipping them
Father Jhon is whipping
Peters and his brother
Turn around
look no more
What are you going to do, 636;
dare you challenge me ?
Don't whip
do not whip
I will crucify you Mercier
You heard me!
I will crucify you
No brother Jhon stop
Shame on Christmas Day!
It's all over ..little one
Come little one
come on let's go
My God I repent I grieve
With all my heart
For by sinning I have deserved...
your chastisements
You do well to pray
for your sins
You betrayed the church and abandoned me
by pulling back
at the first difficulty
But be careful try again
And I will destroy you
because you see brother certain
your activities with the boys...
...did not go unnoticed
My God I repent and sorrow
Of my sins because by sinning...
I have deserved your chastisements
and much more
Because I have offended you eternally good
William - Rosa -I love you don't
forget,
-I will find you again !
-William remember me !
Of Emotions
Of emotion free, it means
free from emotion
Welcome back Mr. Peters
- Thank you
Have a seat
Donei continues

Continue Donei
Al..some of them look like
Deleni you feel bad
Keep dry
Calm down you'll see

''The mute night that surrounds me...''
...''overcome the bars of
your prison.''
''free in the world is your
soirito now...''
''in denied hands touch you
your body.''
''the wind is our only
companion .''
''The night has left its
doors ajar.''
''And we fly beyond the boundaries
of the earth.''
'''Where the rebels are free from their chains.'''
Deleni will read this one
- Thank you sir
Peters this is for you try to
analyze the meaning
- Yes sir
To her after
Raian I hear it later
Rogers a poem by William Eys
you memorize it
Mercier Machbet, scene 8
Of the fifth act
where Machbet and Mc Daf
fight good work guys
I have on my life a spell cannot
can be taken away from me........
Prediction means prediction
or prophecy....
If I had the drapes......
And they collided with thunder roar....
Useless your spell, and
The angel you followed here...
In fabrics of gold....
Gifted bestowed....
The night that surrounds me
overcomes the bars of your prison
I think I know it but then I forget it
And you repeat it without running
you'll see that you can do it
The truth brother Mac is.
the fences have been torn down
And it is our duty to rebuild them
more solid than before
Tired of literature already ?
Help Father Tom sir
He, too, lately you are going
in 4 for others
-Isn't that right Mercie ?
-If you say so sir
Yes I say so
Helping others is
good and right thing...
...but sometimes it can be costly
remember that
....I champions left their posts
at the speed of thunderbolts....
....E collided.....
.....It seems that both riders
had to fall because the collision....
....They both took a half turn and came back......
....Demonstrated public interest....
You'll look great in
this dress
-When is the big day?
-In less than a week
Ei va fan culo you stung me
- Doney
-Be more careful
-I didn't do it on purpose
-I want to go home with my own legs.
-For me they don't recognize you
They didn't even recognize us before
we are 8 fucking
Doney
- Sorry, sir
See you around
-Hello Doney
-See ya
I saw you very well Doney
- Sorry sir
As soon as the trumpets had
given the signal, the champions left
their places....
And who are the communists ?
- Those who do not believe in God....
......Think Frenklin with a gun.
I'll kill you Jhon mercilessly ......
.........Think Frenklin with a gun..........
Have you thought about what you will do once you
come out ?
I don't know.
Would you like to be a teacher ?
- No
Lion why are you here ?
When my mother died
we were left alone
Dad couldn't manage to
keep us in check
I stopped going to school
And I started stealing
until they caught me
-And why are you here?
-It's the only job I could find.
Doney was right, that
remains between the two of us
You have to go
What is it like to be in love
Mr. Frenklin ?
Why do you ask ?
Do you think it will happen to me too ?
Of course it does , why
shouldn't
-How is she?
-Who is she?
The woman he loves
There was photography in the book
I am not able
to tell you
When he got here, he said.
if we asked her anything.
...she would answer us
She was stupemda
But she died
I am sorry sir
They graze your body....
The wind is ours....
Standing trial
The mo.....
Stronger
The mute notes
- The mute night
Surrounding me
Right
Overcome the bars
Of your prison
Sorry Bro.
Mercier you have a visitor
-They won't recognize you so
-It won't take long
Don't take it off
Kalvin I've got my eye on you
Are we all here ?
Mercier has a visitor but
Father Mac says he will soon make
Very good Mr. Roger
It's your turn
If I had the embroidered drapes of heaven
Woven of the gold and silver
The drapes of the colors of day and
night and by those of dawn and sunset
I would spread those drapes under your
feet but I am poor I have only
my dreams
I stretched out my dreams under
Your feet walk softly
For you walk on my dreams
Very good
Bravo Rogers has made
great progress
Mercier I've been waiting for a while
to change 2 words with you son ...
...since in the yard you gave
that exultation of heroism
you take great pride in it and Marcier
You are a thug a thug
And you're not ashamed of it
Did Mr. Frenklin ever tell you
where he was before he came here ?
No sir
Liar !
You know he hates God because
he's a communist
But you cry Mercier I thought
you were a tough guy
Right brother Mac
To Comrade William Frenklin
Standing
Put it up
Put it up !

Liam Mercier has been abused
and humiliated all his life
First by his own family
Then in this school
just by those...
...to whom it had been entrusted by the
church and the state
maybe someone here will want to tell you....
...that Liam Mercier died because of
of an illness
well whoever is going to do it is going to be lying
Liam Mercier was
brutally murdered
this is the only truth
Well brother Willam begin
Good job

I wish you all the best Patrik
Here it is
He leaves
I wish you all the best
Let's go
The mute night that surrounds me
overcomes the bars of your prison
free in the world is your
spirit now and....
Denied hands graze your body
the wind is our only companion, the
night has left its doors ajar
And we fly beyond the ends of the earth
Where rebels are free from chains

Normandy on 6/6/1 944
