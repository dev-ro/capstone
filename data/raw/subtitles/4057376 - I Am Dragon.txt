Bayeux-Bayeux-by.
Fans, Fans Flying!
Then, until the morning
I will stay to wait.
Bayeux-Bayeux-by.
You swim in a distal end
where the clouds are heavy.
But my voice leads you forward.
Bayeux-Bayeux-by.
And nothing is not afraid -
at that end cat into a long sleep
someone remembers you.
My dear!
My Peace!
I Know! I knew you'd come!
Good morning, Armand!
I'm just curious,
why are these snacks and warm blanket
if you do not want to talk to me?
Armand, then I apologize,
now me away;
Sometimes throw me in the pit
You sometimes save lives. No way!
Armand, answer me!
Either we talk,
or will not leave you alone.
why my ancestors
you completed as -
so you do not allow
to speak.
Armand, you are right
You do not want to kill me.
And if so, then why do I have?
Bring me home.
It is not that simple.
- And how complicated? You may know
but I know -
We can find a way out.
Once, long ago,
the island lived a boy.
The boy lived with his father.
His father was a dragon.
The boy loves his father
and dreams of becoming like him.
But once
Sea thrown chest.
Inside was something unprecedented.
To this day I do not know what it's called.
It was from another world. Unknown.
But still - elusive acquaintance.
And something changed in the boy.
And when the time came
to become a dragon
it no longer wants it.
His father did not say anything.
You can not become a dragon
against their will.
After that,
the horizon appeared ship.
The ship went down man
who killed his father.
And then bitterness, fury
and thirst for revenge
pushed the boy
and then jumped off the cliff.
And it turned into a dragon.
Once this happened, the whole memory
of his ancestors penetrated into it.
Suddenly I saw everything
which dragons are seen;
I felt everything you have felt.
Dragons took hundreds of years
brides and doing their bloody ritual.
People gave them girls
Ritual singing a song.
But I did not want that.
Before my eyes are
killed hundreds of brides
if all this
I done.
The boy understood,
that his father was a monster
and that only awakened
monster himself.
And then I swore
that dragons no longer there.
I wanted again to become a man
but I did not know how.
And all I can,
to fight with the dragon.
In the basement there is a narrow passage.
One can go from there,
but the dragon can no longer come out.
So I kept dragon
when he is slipping beyond me.
For all these years
almost I did with him,
but then sang
The ritual song.
The first thing I remember
the girl in the clutches of the dragon.
Barely able to dissolve his nails
and the girl -
I - fell into the pit,
where the dragon
He could no longer reach them.
The pit was not your prison.
Was your refuge from me.
The dragon they felt Mira.
I found him in the pit.
He awakens
once touched you.
Therefore, I can
you bring home.
I can not honor the dragon.
You have to wait for it dragons.
If you swim - you will not balk.
Just never, never
not sing Ritual song.
What does it mean "if"?
You think you can not swim?
Everything will depend on you.
How is it me?
Come on!
How can depend on me
whether he will swim or not.
Look around.
You see - the whole island is a dragon.
My great ancestor.
Stones, rocks all around
They are his bones.
He guarded the place.
From here you can see clear skies
and the people of the ship - on the contrary -
see only fog
and they are doomed to wander in it
until his death.
Ships chests belongings
sometimes reaching shore
but passenger
You can reach the island,
only if there waiting for him
Devic loving heart.
Heart? - Yes.
It will show him the way like a beacon.
So dragons
He managed to swim
for the love of the girl
who has waited here. Right?
As I said -
it all depends on you.
If you love him - will swim.
What are you doing?
When they give flowers to a man
he understands that love him;
Something important
It happens between people.
And besides say
if you throw flowers into the sea
wherever he is, he will feel it
and will understand that remember him.
then,
Igor will also swam.
Right?
Of course, he also swam.
It will be good to hurry.
Let's go!
Igor will wait in the pit.
- In the pit! Again?
Armand, if still not sail?
- It can not. I've already explained,
but you escape the island and ...
Armand, hit me?
- Do not go! Do not touch me!
Go into the pit. Do not you understand!
Armand, not so.
I can not just leave.
Nothing will be fine.
Wont be alone.
If you wanted to be alone,
this morning would wake up
under a warm blanket.
Mira, the dragon may occur
at any moment.
If so,
then why not have it?
I do not know.
Perhaps I am still very weak.
Maybe
just the man to become stronger.
- Do you really believe that?
I see it.
Here, you saved me
Food me, turn me.
You take care of me.
You can beat him!
As you like it.
And I'll help you.
And once you
wait Igor
I will teach you
live human.
You...
Forgive me for yesterday!
Nice start!
Wow!
You can not live here if you want.
Here, surely,
dragon they can not reach.
Armand! - Yes.
But there is nothing here.
No cope without you.
Can you help me?
- Is it necessary?
What if we decided "human"!
It is hard to live
"Human!"
This and that is that. - Many more you?
Come, I will show
how to play.
Do you like?
Except my hair gone.
- To me and so loving.
You know what?
To me, frankly - too.
What are you doing?
- I envy you your dragons!
Jealous ?! - Yes.
You do what you want.
Fly wherever you want!
Scary, indeed ...
I've never been.
Me too.
How so?
But so.
Life - on the island.
I did not want the dragon ...
It turns out that you and I, both,
We flew for the first time?
So out.
This?
No.
And that? - No!
Give ... Actually ... Yes.
Stay!
Wipe your feet.
You do where?
Thus, already live here, and he ...
Armand!
Far away you are flying dragons?
- Far away.
Help us winds. all
They are somehow different.
And all are beautiful in his own way.
When you watch the wind ... - Wait!
Do not you see the wind?
Of course. Do not you see?
People do not see the wind, Armand.
How can you not see the wind?
- And how can it?
Do you? ... Will
I show the wind!
As the flame burns your eyes
heart confuses his beats.
To love is scary
but I'm afraid -
I will sleep and will not wake up.
I'm not there already -
was ash and smoke.
Burned even my tears.
You're not my mother,
but not my and foreign;
Friend or foe -
choose it yourself.
I think,
that will now begin.
What?
I believe in you and
reveal all the secrets
a relentless beast -
I know you're not my enemy.
Spread your wings
and let your dreams become true
Kill me boldly -
like last time.
Hey, what are you doing!
These are my things.
What are you looking at? You think I'm a traitor?
I want to sail?
How was I to know
whether he will defeat the dragon or not.
Do not get mad!
It may not be necessary
to sail.
I just packed up.
Just in case.
And imagine what happened to me,
when the sea discarded keg of rum.
There has never been
so nice
before you!
For both of us
many things were for the first time.
By the way here I found something for you.
I think,
I've heard this tune.
What is this? - Lullaby.
Sing it to children
to know that Mom is up to them.
Let today be your birthday.
Nobody remembers this day
but all it note
as a holiday.
I remember how I was born.
I want to forget it.
But not today be born
a new man!
And I'm very happy about it.
Happy birthday, Armand!
Let your life has
not only Ritual song!
I'm a new man! ...
Thanks!
I have a gift for you.
To remember you
this day forever.
Close eyes!
Open them!
I call this "heavenly flowers."
How beautiful!
And on the other side of the world to -
See them!
Wake up!
Calm, quiet! ...
I ran so ... You cried!
What is it?
I had a bad dream.
Sleep! And I do not see dreams.
What dreams usual?
Sometimes - what
you afraid;
And sometimes - what you want.
Very afraid of the dragon
Armand,
and all the time,
I collected ...
- Dragon will not harm you, Mira!
Never!
I promise!
We today are born a new man
thanks to you
and you need him!
Good night, Armand!
What?
People are separated so
for the night.
Good night, Armand!
Goodnight dear!
When they give flowers to a man
he understands that love it
something important
It happens between people.
Armand!
That's where my Armand! And I...
Look what came up!
Almost like a dragon
only not off.
Will you teach me to see the wind?
- Strange you, Mira!
Why?
- You're afraid of the dragon, and play with him.
Why Igor does not come to you?
If it does not come, then ...
You know what that means.
- You are whether oath!
Unable Armand.
The dragon came before.
So, it will not come to you.
Feel it
with the tips of your fingers
hear his whisper, felt
it with all your skin
and then inside you
will reveal what
for what you did not know.
Flew!
Armand!
Armand? Where are you, Armand?
Have you tried to escape?
- From here you can not escape.
But it can sail ...
I call this "heavenly flowers."
And on the other side of the world to -
See them!
Very afraid of the dragon
Armand,
and all the time I collected ...
halfway around the world to -
See them!
Now will happen as I want.
I need to escape.
Can you help me?
Very afraid of the dragon
Armand ...
I need to escape.
Can you help me?
Can you hear me?
Where are you? Armand!
Go to the altar.
Go!
And we call
"Born from the ashes."
here
What do dragons
with brides.
They did not just kill them.
They burned alive.
Fill them with flame
and do not leak from your nails
while shouting;
While they eat them from the inside;
While there is nothing left
but ashes and a new dragon.
So I popped in the world too.
so dragons
continue its kind.
And the same will happen to you,
Peace!
Why are you telling me this?
- I'm a freak.
I never will
"Human."
I do not think so.
- I know the boat.
But Armand, I! ...
- I understand now -
did not want to stand in the pit because
always hoped to sail.
And finding your way:
- "I'll learn to live more" human ";
Way to pull crates
to find cards;
Way to signal to ships.
That left only one thing:
"Will you teach me
to see the wind, Armand? "-
to overcome the spell of the island,
which prevents you sail.
Armand, I did not think ...
- I do not blame you.
Everything is perfect -
to be afraid of me.
But you said
I can conquer the dragon
and I fought, but why
since you do not believe.
Armand!
- Enough! Morning climbed into the boat.
Will pick up the canvas. east wind
will appear in the open sea.
Ships are there. They'll see.
- Do not go!
What will happen to the "new man"?
Remember! I need him!
Here you need just a dragon!
Go away!
Hey, ye, pigeons,
hey ye, sivichki,

And I - soul

You're the only

Heavy sins and pretezhki -

In the mist, it's certain death.
Let go of oars - can then

Even secret here.
It was right about you
older sister.
Rights say was.
Cause you her eye on her.
You think I do not know the secret of my grandfather!
Gently, gently!
With love, Mira should give me
sign from the coast - something like a beacon,
and find out
where to go.
Good is the way, right?
And if the sign does not, what does that mean?
It means that gone.
Chu, right?
Pay ship! We're going home.
Dragon!
This is not a dragon.
This is a "sign"!
Peace!
When the dragon carried me,
caught in a storm.
He crashed into the rocks
and I was alone on the island.
There were broken ships.
There I found the boat.
Thank you for coming to me!
Could not do
in other way.
Do you love me?
- Cneajna, I'm glad you're saved,
but we need to get to the island.
