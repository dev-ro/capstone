PART l: LOVE AND SUFFERING
HOKKAIDO IN DECEMBER
What a voice!
Sorry. I was dreaming.
Dreaming?
I thought you were dying.
Indeed.
I was about to be shot.
I often have the same dream.
I was a war criminal and sentenced to be shot.
You're still alive.
At the last moment
they found I was the wrong man. I was saved.
But the shock drove me crazy.
I was in an American hospital.
Down south?
Okinawa. I'm better now.
They released me ten days ago.
What illness?
Idiocy.
They call it dementia epilepsia.
I had fits. Then I became an idiot.
An idiot?
"Dostoevsky wanted to portray
a genuinely good man.
"Ironically he chose an idiot for his hero.
"But a truly good man
may seem like an idiot to others.
"This is the tragic story.
"Of the ruin of a pure and simple man."
Get up! This man is sick!
No, don't bother... Go ahead.
Accept kindness, idiot!
I'm sorry. It's just a habit.
Don't worry. I don't mind.
That's a relief.
Are you cold?
Yes, very cold.
You're some guy.
"Akama hadn't laughed for many years.
"Dominated by his father,
he acted like a caged animal.
"Oddly, he got to like Kameda,
who made him laugh.
"Kameda had told him about Taeko Nasu.
"One look at her
released Akama's pent-up feelings.
"Enchanted by the woman,
"Akama bought her a diamond
with his father's money.
"Enraged by it, his father disowned him.
"But owing to the man's death,
Akama will go home.
"Kameda is going to Hokkaido, too,
to see Ono, his relative."
Another snowstorm in Hokkaido.
Look, just follow me.
That's Taeko Nasu.
Don't you think she's charming?
Very much so. But...
But what?
It hurts me to look at her face.
Why?
She seems so very unhappy somehow.
Why are you crying?
I don't know. Looking at this portrait, I...
You're really an odd guy.
You make me feel strange,
as if I were looking at a newborn lamb.
I'll go. Beware, the world's full of wolves.
Kameda saw her and wept.
A woman of ill repute.
They say she'd been
Tohata's property since childhood.
And that Tohata now has to pay 600,000 yen
to get rid of her.
The shadow of Taeko Nasu
darkens the house Kameda seeks.
What are you going to do about Kameda?
About Kameda? Well...
He's counting on our help.
I'll try to find him some sort of work.
Kayama has rooms for rent,
so Kameda can stay there
Is that all?
What do you mean?
It's how you act recently.
How do I act?
You're behaving so secretively.
All those meetings.
Tohata may have a lot of influence, but
To force his woman on Kayama...
You know nothing! It's not bad!
I'm glad I don't know.
But any man who'd do a thing
like that isn't welcome here!
But...
Change the subject!
I want to talk to you about that idiot.
I'm against deceiving such a simple man.
"The army had reported Kameda officially dead.
"So Ono sold Kameda's father's
125-acre farm through Kayama.
"Kayama is now about to marry Taeko.
"In exchange for 600,000 yen.
"But, Kayama is too weak to assert himself.
"Kayama would rather have Ayako,
the younger daughter."
Good morning.
Sleep well?
In the way?
Not really. I was just listening
to Kayama's views on life.
It's Taeko's birthday tomorrow.
You haven't forgotten?
I know, sir.
Very well.
Mr. Tohata and I talked her
into giving an answer at the party.
You'd better be there.
I understand.
Knock first!
Something I shouldn't hear?
Lunch is ready, Mr. Kameda.
"Ayako - headstrong like her mother.
"At times fastidious, at times mean."
What if all this were yours?
Lf, you say?
Would you be happy?
Yes, of course.
It may be yours.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
It's a beautiful sight.
What's the matter?
Why do you look at me like that?
Somehow I just can't believe that you're ill.
I wish I weren't.
I'm funny, right?
It's all right. I don't mind.
People laugh at me.
I'm funny without even trying.
What are you like?
I want to know more about you.
What about before the war?
Well...
Rather not?
It's not that so much.
I vividly remember the day I got a reprieve.
Everything before that seems unreal.
Tell me about it, then.
How did you feel
when you were facing certain death?
The world, its people,
everything in it suddenly seemed dear to me
The people in the world?
Each and every person I'd known.
And everyone I'd passed.
And not only the people.
There was a dog I'd stoned as a child.
I wondered why I couldn't have been kinder.
To the dog?
Kinder to everyone.
I thought, "If I were pardoned
and didn't have to die..."
I promised myself
I'd be kinder and nicer to everyone around.
"It's no use," I said. "I'm going to be shot!"
Thinking of it made me feel terrible.
I sensed that I was going mad.
Where were you?
Mr. Kayama wants to take you home now.
Where were you?
Don't ask. She's stubborn and won't tell.
Take care. She never mentions it,
but she's proud of her beauty.
It's made her very headstrong.
What about the way she frowns at me?
Isn't that typical of her?
Indeed.
Taeko Nasu surprised me.
But I must admit she's beautiful.
Where did you see her?
In a photo studio window.
I want to see it.
Go on, say I'm too curious!
I'd like to see it, too.
Not me.
Really?
I want to see Mr. Kayama.
Will you call him? He's in the study.
Mother!
Sorry not to send the girls. I have a reason.
Calling me?
What for? Do you have an idea?
I told them about Taeko Nasu, and...
What? Do you know about her?
But how?
You overheard Mr. Ono and me,
and you passed it on?
I just...
Why did you do that?
I only told them
about the picture at the station.
It can't be helped. I'll go.
Do me a big favor.
Give Miss Ayako a letter for me.
Is it a bother?
No. But why not do it yourself?
You can see her any time.
No. I have a reason for not doing it.
I don't want anyone else to see it,
and I'm in a hurry.
Mother's in the guest room.
Let's go upstairs.
Mr. Kayama asked me to hand this to you.
I'm inclined to be too outspoken.
But don't be offended.
I can't stand dishonesty.
We've been like relatives,
so I'll speak to you like a mother.
You're going to marry soon?
No, I'm not. Instead I'm...
No? Are you sure about that?
I...
Can't you tell me clearly?
When a girl isn't proud
to mention her marriage,
it makes me wonder.
That's all I wanted to tell you.
I got some sarcastic remarks because of you.
But I -
No excuses!
Did she answer my letter?
Mr. Kameda, please come.
Are you coming with me? I'll wait outside.
Read it.
Isn't it Mr. Kayama's letter?
Yes. Read it! Read it aloud to me!
You gave it to me.
"Tomorrow decides my fate.
"You need say but a single word.
"If you still feel as you once did toward me.
"Tell me to cancel my marriage.
"And I gladly will do so."
He's about to marry,
enticed by power and 600,000 yen.
A contemptible marriage.
He wants me to tell him to cancel it.
A trade of my friendship for 600,000 yen!
If he'd have refused it,
I might have become his friend.
Give it back to him!
Tell him my answer:
"There're no bargaining for friendship."
No bargaining for friendship.
That's my answer to him.
Her answer?
Didn't you give it to her?
Of course I did. But she said to read it, so...
Read it?
She said to give it back.
She herself told you to read it? Did she?
Yes. I didn't want to, but...
You ass! She'd never ask you
to do a thing like that.
But she did. I have her answer.
Which is?
"No bargaining for friendship."
She said,
"There's no bargaining for friendship."
KAYAMA-SO INN
Again!
Tattling here too. It's a disgrace!
You, too.
Takako!
Apologize to him.
You've been acting strangely, so I called him.
He told you everything?
Don't be silly!
How could he have, when he just came?
I'm worried. Is it almost settle this time?
Who but he would tell you about that?
I told her.
Exactly.
But why? Why?
Tohata's property?
I'm not referring to the woman. I meant you.
I want to know why you're marrying her.
I know.
He hates being poor.
Be quiet!
I can't stand it. You're detestable!
What? Say that again!
Yes! Any number of times.
You're detestable and she is, too!
If she comes here to live, I'll move out!
As you wish!
Don't take it so calmly. There's a lot more.
I wrote to her everything I said to you.
You bitch!
Run, Takako! Run!
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Announce me.
Wait. Who will you say is here?
Strange man!
Taeko Nasu.
How did you know?
Well, I...
Never mind that. Just announce me.
I'm going to marry her.
It's worth it to make you angry!
Miss Nasu is here.
The entrance was cold, so I came inside.
You look pale. Anything wrong?
Introduce me.
My sister. Miss Nasu.
My mother. Miss Nasu.
How do you do. I'm glad you came.
Are you really?
I'm a fool, aren't I?
It's a magnificent home.
I thought I might not be welcome here.
That's...
Mother, a word.
Make some tea.
May I sit down, too?
Please do.
Don't be such a nuisance! We have a guest now.
My father. Miss Nasu.
Jumpei Kayama,
a pitiful wronged former soldier.
I'm fifty years old,
but I haven't done a thing.
Let me introduce
Mr. Kameda, Mr. Ono's relative.
He's interesting.
Sorry I asked you to announce me.
Well, I...
How did you know me?
Before that, why did you seem so surprised?
I felt as though
I'd seen your eyes somewhere before.
Then, it's true!
My rival!
Why are you here?
Who are you?
Huh! Him?
Who are you?
I'm Denkichi Akama, and I have plenty of money!
I'll buy you out!
Get out of here!
Are you really going to marry this man?
I remember now.
You once gave me a diamond, didn't you?
But why are you asking me that?
In what way do our marriage plans concern you?
Look, I'll pay you 600,000 yen, so give her up!
What are you talking about? Are you drunk?
700,000 yen! 800,000!
Ass! Leave, or I'll call the police!
A million yen! I'll bring it tonight!
A million by tonight, All right?
My price has suddenly gone up by 400,000 yen?
Scum!
Father!
He made fools of you, nevertheless you'd -
Shut up!
No! Not after we've been shamed like this!
Kick her out, or I will!
That's enough!
Don't meddle! Out of my way!
Fool brother!
It's all right. I don't mind. Not at all.
He's a lamb. You've no shame.
It's nothing. Nothing at all.
Nothing.
You're not like that.
You're not, yet...
I'm exactly what she said I was.
Will you forgive me?
Goodbye, Mr. Kayama. Tonight, then.
You too, Mr. Kameda. Don't forget.
The hostess leaving her guests?
What's the matter?
You look pale.
Do you have a fever?
That's why I'm waring this.
Why not rest a little?
I'd like to speak with you.
You're very kind, but I want to drink more.
What's the matter? Enjoy yourselves.
Mr. Kameda has arrived.
That man! He saw her at my place.
Not together? I asked you to see to it.
Show him in.
Why see him?
He's an idiot?
I don't think so.
He might even be somewhat
more clever than you...
At least in knowing about how people fell.
I knew it!
The nerve of you!
How cold I...!
Do you know what it's worth?
I have one question: Didn't you give it to me?
Then let me do as I wish.
I'd intended to break them, anyway.
I won't bother with introductions.
No one here is worth it.
What a remark!
Fortunately, though, I already know him.
What's wrong? Why stare at her like that?
Really. Is there anything the matter?
It just occurred to me.
I thought I'd seen eyes like yours.
I just remembered where.
Eyes like mine?
Why is it I didn't remember?
What was the person like?
A man who was sentenced to die, like me.
There were three Judas-trees,
and three men were shot at the same time.
I was in the rear of two rows of men.
I would have been shot soon.
I had no idea that I would get a reprieve.
I didn't think I'd live.
And the man? The one with eyes like mine?
In the first group shot.
He couldn't have been over twenty.
He looked like a boy.
Tied to that tree, he seemed to be in a trance.
He suddenly began trembling.
He looked at us as if to complain.
The eyes of a man who has undergone suffering,
alone, for a long time.
His eyes seem to say,
"Why must I endure this kind of pain?"
He suffered a lot.
His eyes seemed ready to burst and spurt blood.
For a moment I forgot
I was about to be shot, too.
I turned my eyes away.
At times your eyes
are almost exactly like that boy's.
What next? What happened to the soldier?
The next thing, I heard gunfire.
I jerked my head to look at him.
And there he was, limp, like a rag.
That's too much!
It's too gruesome. This is a birhtday party.
Quiet, please!
My birthday means nothing to you, does it?
Mr. Kameda.
Frankly...
They say I'm to marry Mr. Kayama.
I'm supposed to give him my answer tonight.
Should I accept or not?
Taeko!
Bad taste!
I'll do as you say.
How absurd!
Please, Mr. Kameda, tell me.
Why ask him? What's he to you?
Don't you know?
He trusted me the first time
he laid eyes on me.
What else can I do but trust him?
So tell me. Please advise me what to do.
You shouldn't marry him.
Then I won't.
Did you hear that, Mr. Kayama?
That's my answer to you.
That's ridiculous!
What about the promise you made a few days ago?
Tohata, what's the meaning of this?
I see. Does this make you satisfied?
What?
I see. You hate to
part with your treasure, is that it?
I'm the dupe.
You are? You mean I am!
You're responsible.
Pals shouldn't fight.
Mr. Ono and Mr. Kayama,
don't try to blame Mr. Tohata.
I'll never go back to him.
What a face!
You needn't pay one yen for your freedom.
Put away your 600,000 yen.
I'll return this house
and everything else you gave to me.
Taeko!
I'm leaving, with only what I'm wearing.
Taeko! I ws wrong. I'm such a fool!
Forget it.
I'm not a fourteen year old girl now.
Listen to me. I promise you.
I don't care what the world thinks.
I'll marry you!
Don't be so conceited as to think that I'd...
Who are you?
What is this?
A million yen.
You kept your promise? Thank you.
10He'll pay a million yen for me.
400,000 more than you will.
I'm through with this.
As of tomorrow I'm broke.
No man would accept somebody's castoff
Who doesn't have any money.
Am I right?
Kameda 's the man to ask.
If it were me, I'd take care of you.
What did you just say?
I said, if it were me, I'd look after you.
A woman like me? The way I am?
Of course.
But what do you mean, "A woman like me"?
I don't understand.
Why laugh?
Did I put it in a funny way?
Look, all I wanted to say was this:
Miss Nasu is very chaste.
That's enough, idiot!
Are you making fun of me?
I'm really a sick man. My brain is rotten.
So I may have said something odd.
But I tried to express
what I honestly think of you.
I don't care if the world laughs at me.
I think you're chaste.
You said you'd leave, taking nothing with you.
That's fine with me.
And I'll let no one speak ill of you.
So why feel ashamed?
Why sell yourself to a man
like him for a dirty 1,000,000 yen?
Don't interfere!
Let me speak.
You've suffered too much alone.
So you feel uncomfortable if you don't suffer.
You really are ill.
You need a kind nurse.
I'll be a nurse and take care of you.
How can you support
a woman who's used to high living?
You're a pauper!
I'll find work, somehow.
What work? Shoveling snow?
They'd pay him only 300 yen for it.
Not even enough to buy her cosmetics.
That's enough. Stop making fun of him.
Thank you.
No one has ever said anything like that to me.
Miss Taeko...
I think...
I'll manage.
When I first saw your picture,
you seemed to be calling me.
As a matter of fact,
I'd been waiting for a man like you.
I waited even while leading such a life.
I'd sit and think.
I formed a mental image of a man like you.
I hoped a nice man,
honest and kind, would finally appear.
"Taeko, it's not your fault."
"I deeply repect you."
I hoped he'd phrase it something like that.
Then a man actually would come.
He'd use me, deprave me, and go away.
You'll never know how much I hated it.
I'd rather drop dead
in the streets than continue this life.
But...
I'm afraid your idea...
is out of the question.
Everyone, I have an important announcement.
No, It's actually a confession.
As a man, I'm despicable, utterly, completely.
I hid from everyone the fact that Mr. Kameda
has a fortune.
As his relative,
I believed it in his best interest.
Anyway, I want to announce
that he's the owner of a 125-acre farm.
Step inside!
You really mean what you said about her?
It's a joke.
What? Then, you mean...?
It's clear, isn't it? I'll go with him.
Taeko, why? Surely not with him?
Step aside!
Listen.
How can I ruin the life
of a naive man like you?
You forgot something important: 1,000,000 yen.
I raised it myself.
Be quiet. Keep away.
I'll give it to Mr. Kayama.
Take it out with your bare hands,
and it's all yours!
It's burning!
It'll be lost completely! A million yen!
I wrapped it myself!
Be quiet! Keep away!
Don't just stand there.
Hurry, or it'll burn completely!
What's the matter? Don't you want it?
You worm! See now?
That's how we do things.
Don't pretend. Be yourself.
Or you'll regret it.
Pull it out, for God's sake!
What's a little pride?
Hurry!
The money's burning! Burning!
It's safe! It's all right!
Only four or five thousand burned.
Step aside!
Everybody!
This is all for Mr. Kayama!
He watched it. He would have let it burn.
So it's for him!
Understand?
With that, farewell, everyone.
Goodbye, Mr. Kameda.
Come, men! Drink!
Don't go, Kameda!
You can't save such a woman.
Kameda!
FEBRUARY
Ayako, don't play with your bread!
Why are you all so quiet?
Something's wrong lately.
The weather... no sun for weeks.
It makes everybody depressed.
It's not that. I know! It's that man!
I really misjudged him.
Why pay him so
he can squander the money on her?
But...
The way you did it displeases me.
Isn't there a better way?
Karube, his representative!
And you, acting so upset and secretive,
as if you felt guilty!
That man, too!
Couldn't he send a thank-you note?
Is he really an idiot?
What's so funny?
But...
"But" again! Can't you say anything else?
But, Ayako...
She's up to something again? Such young ladies!
Tell me. What is it?
He sent her an odd letter.
An odd letter? When?
A week ago. By Kayama's brother.
Kaoru, the junior high school boy?
Kameda used him?
Kameda's in Tokyo. How could he do it?
He put his letter in Kaoru's.
So? What did the letter say?
"Frankly, I have no idea
why I'm writing to you like this.
"But I simply cannot suppress the hope that
"perhaps you sometimes think about me.
"For reasons I find it difficult to explain,
"you are very important to me.
"I've nothing else
to say or write about myself.
"I wish you happiness."
What's funny?
This letter is funny. Do you know why?
It's because Kameda doesn't lie.
He's totally honest.
Now you can't laugh, can you?
I see. You lost, didn't you?
But why did he send it?
Have you heard anything about the idiot?
Evidently he's still chasing Taeko,
just like Akama is.
And Taeko...
It's as though she's swinging
like a pendulum between them.
She once said she'd marry Akama,
but she ran away with Kameda.
Something's bound to happen.
Forget something?
No, but I...
I felt someone looking.
What is it, a murder or something?
Akama's not above murder.
Stop! It's depressing as it is!
Come in.
Come as you are.
Watch your step.
What's wrong? Why stare at me like that?
Sit down.
Akama, I want you to tell me the truth.
Were you at the station?
I won't say.
A pair of eyes in the crowd
looked exactly like yours.
Whose eyes?
Did I imagine it then?
I sometimes have hallucinations.
The room is dark, huh?
An old house.
I spotted your house
from a distance of at least 100 yards.
Oh? How?
Intuition. I have a feeling
your house would be like this.
Yes, it is dark.
You have a forbiddingly
dark aura about yourself, too.
Staying here after you marry?
Of course. It's my home.
You know I can't decide
a thing like that alone.
Please, I wish you'd tell me the truth.
I don't want to meddle or anything.
She's here in this house now, isn't she?
Have you decided?
If we have?
You came to find out?
Not really.
But I think it's best
if the two of you don't marry.
I told you, didn't I?
Marriage would spell
the ruination of you and of her too.
There's nothing I can do to stop you.
You understand, don't you?
I can only feel sorry for her.
Everything she does worries me.
I can't just watch.
We talked about this before, didn't we?
I ask only for her happiness, nothing more.
Why scowl at me.
I'll leave. Goodbye.
Stay. It's been quite a while.
The minutes you leave,
I know I'll hate you again.
You made me boil
for a month after we parted in Tokyo.
I could've murdered you!
It's true.
But facing you, I soon forget my anger.
And oddly I like you as much as ever.
You're different. We're opposite types.
Have a drink.
For instance, you love her
because you're sorry for her.
