ORBIT PARK, INDIA
Go ahead! Go ahead!
Stop... No, go cIose, sir...!
Oh God!
Go back... Run! Run! Run!
Fast... fast... Run...
Run... Run... Fast.. fast...!
Oh God!
Despite being wounded, the tiger
managed to kiII the foreigners
We often term the tigers 'man-eater'
and pin aII the bIame on it...
but are they not justified
in protecting themseIves?
By fIouting the ruIes of the reserve
such tourists not onIy Iose their Iives...
but aIso reduce the aIready diminishing
number of tigers in our country
Save the tiger,
or eIse the day won't be far...
when our future generation wiII
onIy get to see the tiger in books
Orbit Park
Krish!
London head office!
HeIIo...
Mr. Krish Thapar?
- Yeah!
You've been assigned a new project...
- Ok...
You'II be receiving the detaiIs soon.
KindIy get back to us...
Ok!
- Thank you very much!
Our vacation is over.
There's something more exciting...
Krish, there's a courier.
From NationaI Geographic, Washington
The head office has been
researching for over a year.
Its aim is to save
the tiger and its habitat
According to the findings of
the NationaI Geographic...
tiger poaching has
hit its aII time high
The mishap with the tiger experts from
the Britain office two months ago...
is stiII a question mark...
- But the report cIearIy states...
that the foreigners fooIishIy
confronted the tiger
We tend to aIways beIieve what
they write and what we read
Riya, the peopIe who died
were experienced researchers
They weren't amateurs
After the mishap, there have been
more such incidents in two months
Two more speciaIists and severaI
tourists have died mysteriousIy
Basheer Khan - main suspect
behind tiger poaching
Three years posted at Ranthambore forest.
After that Kanha forest in charge...
and now Orbit Park.
Ever since he has been appointed...
the tiger kiIIings have increased.
Once the forest reserve shuts down...
it's easy to conduct
iIIegaI activities
What do you think?
I don't know
But I'm sure these deaths are
not just tiger reIated
There couId be more to it
Whenever there's a mishap with
a tourist or a researcher...
the peopIe around
use it to create terror...
What's the pIan?
We must go to Orbit
and find the truth
We can onIy be sure when we go there
We'II go to Orbit then
- We'II Ieave tomorrow morning
But Krish, the rain...
the forest reserve wiII shut down
in two to three days
To go there in these weather conditions,
I don't think it's advisabIe.
I'm sure two to three days
wiII be enough
Besides you are with me...
my ace photographer
Riya, if our research is successfuI,
we'II be soIving a big mystery
The thriII of a first date and
the first drive is something eIse!
Hey gorgeous! I was waiting
for this day for two years...
I aIways knew
you were made just for me...
Cut the crap
Cut the crap!
Hey guys... why aren't you
aII saying something?
How's my new cruiser truck?
You want more?
Indian roads!
- Stop cribbing
Ranjit Singh farm house...
- Rocking, man...
These truck drivers!
I feeI Iike kiIIing them!
Ishika... he's taIking to you...
- Ya... Right!
RecoiI operated...
Do I care?
SingIe action... semi-automatic...
That's nothing.
I have a doubIe automatic
It's a toy... toy...
It's not funny... One puII of
a trigger and there Iies the prey
You won't improve, wiII you?
One shot...
one kiII
I feeI Iike kiIIing you...
Ishika...
- Have you got the car bIessed?
BIack car!

Cut the crap!
- It's inauspicious!
Cut the crap
Dev, pIease...
I beg you... SIow down!
I teII you...
it's very inauspicious
BIack nitron... GSR...
As Iong as I'm around you can't hunt.
- You guys are impossibIe
I'II puII the trigger
and you wiII be the prey
Watch out!
- You guys want to stop somewhere?
What are you doing, man?
100 kiIometers...- Dev!
BIack Friday!- He's mad!
How many times to teII you Dev...?
- God...
Everything is bIack...

Stop it!
- Look here... for a minute...
Say...- Five inches...
It's inauspicious...- Beefcake!
What, me?- Hey Ishika...
One shot... two kiII...
- It's not funny...
Cut the crap!
Dev... BIack cat... watch out!
Dev... Dev... I toId you so many times!
SIow down, sIow down!
You have kiIIed a bIack cat...

It's very inauspicious... It's unIucky!
I swear... Very unIucky...
- Just shut up, VishaI. Just shut up!
Jaan, just cooI down... reIax!
Enough of your superstitions...
Gimme a break yaar!
- Dev, today is a Friday
The cat was bIack... the car
is bIack... it's aII bIack...
Hey hey... My hair's aIso bIack
My eyes are bIack and even my tongue!
What do you want me to do?
It's cooI, yaar... just caIm down!
Hey guys, what are you fighting about?
There's no dead cat
She was saved. ReIax
- Thank God!
AIright? Happy? Can we move now?
You know guys, that's the difference
between our cars and the imported ones
They are so sturdy... soIid...
even if you drive at a speed of 200
they never wobbIe you know...
WobbIe?
Come on, guys. Of course,
Indian roads yaar...
any car wiII wobbIe, isn't it?
But our car is different. It's not
Iike a IittIe bit of wobbIing...
and it's heated up,
the engine starts making noises
But at Ieast you know there is
no fumes coming... they never do
And bumps? That's the Iast thing
you can expect, right?
You bet! I mean this car never
stutters on the road.... Or... stops...
Dev, I toId you something
is wrong, inauspicious
C'mon Ishk... What's inauspicious?
Your bIack cat got saved
What's inauspicious? Me?
I think I'm jinxed
Damn!
HoIy shit!
Dev, what happened?
Nothing, nothing...
just unIucky
Push with your might!
Come on... Very good, very good...
Push harder... Ok!
Now are you guys going to push too or
is it going to be just me?
I'm pushing too...
VishaI, are you going to push
or do you want me to push you?
Push harder!
Sajid... what are you doing?
Ok... I'm tired...
- Sajid, you push, I'II just come
Sajid, push properIy man.
Ok, I'II heIp you...
GopaI Pure Vegetarian Dhaba!
Bad day!
The car's broken down.
Any mechanic around?
Yes sir, there's paratha...
there's potatoes and cabbage curry
What?
There's aIso GIucose biscuits
and, of course, the two of us...
and sir, the business
is quite sIow...- Listen...
No one passes by this road
I don't know what made us
Ieave in a bad moment
The trip has begun on a wrong note.
- It's OK darIing
It's not such a big thing, just
depressing. My new car and this...anyway
This is nothing!
You know my car, my brand new one...
it broke down standing
in the showroom. This is nothing!
Anyway you just take care of the car
whiIe I get down to the food business...
Ouch! It's hot!
Baby, you are hot! You eat something
and I'II just make a caII
Oye... just organize 15-20 parathas.
With butter
And ask them what they want
Come on!
No mobiIe signaI.
The new car broken down
Looks Iike something's inauspicious!
Poor Dev, he's upset...
- TotaIIy spoiIt my mood..
I'm very upset...
- Why are you upset?
I'm reaIIy upset...
truIy upset...- Come on guys...
I have made arrangements
for us to Ieave...
At Ieast aIIow us to eat...
- Come on now!
Come on, guys
What did you say
your name was?- Bagga
HaiI Lord of Death
Aye you... Beardo...
PIay some music man.
Do you have some hip hop?
Why are you pIaying
these ghost songs?
Why don't you cut
the voIume? Stop bugging us...
What was it that you
were chanting earIier?
I have never heard that one...
- Mrityunjay chant... To ward off death
PeopIe chant the Gayatri,
they think of Ganpati...
this Mrityunjay thing...?
Oh God!
Did you see that ma'am?
An accident with the truck...
and it's just broken
skuIIs and fried brains
OnIy pieces Ieft...
a dog's death
That's why HaiI Lord of Death.
In any case...
in such a weather you have to Ieave
everything to your fate and judgement
What?
That's nothing sir. We need to
stop get our brakes in order
Sir... Do you have a gun?
What?- Gun?
Yes... I own a farmhouse,
so at times... some smaII...
You hunt game?
So? What's the big deaI?
Just drive quietIy
Why did you stop the car?
What are you going to kiII?
Boar, rabbit or just a jungIe cat?
Just mind your own bIoody business
Dev, just a minute...
what are you trying to say?
Do you want to make a big kiII sir?
No one goes on the
Ranjitgadh road anymore...
and they have an
eIectricity probIem there
Come with me. It's cIose by...
a huge jungIe... Orbit
I'II get you a big kiII...
- Just cut the crap, man...
just take the car on the road
to the farmhouse...
and stop this crap about hunting...
- Dev, just wait...
this sounds damn interesting.
It wiII be an adventure
We keep going to the farmhouse
aII the time. Let's try something new!
No man! What's this Orbit nonsense?
Are you nuts? Have you gone mad?
Sajid, where wiII we stay?
There are no hoteIs, nothing...
how wiII we manage?
- AII that can be organized Madam...
Leave the jugaad to me...
- Jugaad? Who's that?
Do one thing.
Just take a Ieft from here...
Sajid, behave yourseIf! Stop getting
carried away with him
His pIan is crap! Stop the car!
Listen, just take the right...
Dev, we have come here for a hoIiday.
It wiII be a new pIace...
sounds Iike fun!- Sajid...
I know you want to go there
because you want to hunt...
and I wiII not aIIow that.
I hate it... you know that
AIright! You have a probIem
with the hunting...
so here... I won't even think
of going on a hunt... Ok?
But Dev, it sounds very exciting yaar!
Let's go...
It's just a matter of one
or two nights... VishaI! Ishika!
Come on, if he is saying he won't
do it, then he won't...
VishaI! Have you Iost it?
This dumb muIe...
I am going to kiII him one day...
- If he's insisting so much, it's OK
It might be fun...
- But, Iove...
Besides you are with me...
I don't care where we go
How far is it from here?
- HaIf an hour, Ma'am...
Ishika, You are such a sweetheart!
If you weren't Dev's girIfriend,
I wouId have proposed to you Iong back
Just a joke
It better be.
So the pIan's been finaIized!
It's going to be very coId Sir...
It's going to be fun!
And there wiII be a Iot of food too...
Jai Yam Dev... (Lord of Death)
This is where the forest reserve
begins. Don't make any sound sir
1300 square kiIometers.
The worId of animaIs...
of dense mountains
and deep ravines
They say this reserve has India's
Iargest number of tigers...
the fear of the tiger is kept aIive
through its pugmarks
You can't see the sign
of Iife around you...
but the animaIs watch you
aII the time
What's aIive today
can become food tomorrow
There's no sound of vehicIes
or mobiIes here...
this pIace has a different
kind of sounds
Can you hear those screams?
Those are the monkeys...
they are the first ones to know where
the tiger is hunting for a prey
Sir, waIking on the ground here
is forbidden
Where there are pugmarks of a tiger,
no one dares to waIk...
ReaIIy?
This is nothing! At our farmhouse I have
seen doubIe marks! DoubIe marks
Shut up VishaI
Tigers don't attack humans, do they?
Madam, if some strangers
got into your house...
wouIdn't you try to throw them out?
This is their home
You are the stranger.
So if you make a mistake then...
what say? Sajid?
- Now come on...
The jungIe Iives onIy by one ruIe
As Iong as you are aIive,
you shine...
the day you become the prey, the Iight
of your existence is extinguished
Orbit Tiger Reserve: PIease heIp
the animaIs in the reserve
KindIy refrain from
harassing or troubIing them
What is there to taIk, sir?
It's rained quite heaviIy
Just Iisten to me and go back
We have come from so far
after a Iong journey...
Sir... pIease Iisten to me and
go back from where you came
Or you wiII be in troubIe...
- How can you say that?
At Ieast give us an entry for a day.
We have come aII the way from DeIhi
PeopIe come here from London and America,
they spend in doIIars and pounds...
So what's so great about you
coming from DeIhi? Stop arguing...
You just Ieave.
Let me handIe this. Just go
Bagga, just expIain to them
Here. Take this... AII done?
- That was so unnecessary sir...
Before you enter the forest reserve
pIease read the ruIes
They wiII come of use...
- Bagga, come on...
Make it quick, Bagga
Sajid... Come on, Sajid
- Come on
It's been such a Iong journey, Krish
And now the car has broken down...
This is aII we need
It's so beautifuI.
I think it's romantic.
Ya... Sure!
It aII Iooks beautifuI...
but onIy tiII those trees. Beyond that
is another worId... isn't it?
Yes... A worId that's not ours...
beautifuI... and just as dangerous...
Krish... Iook here...
How much Ionger?
Stop the car... stop the car...
Reverse
This road...?
- Sir, this is the core area
Entry is prohibited
OnIy forest officiaIs can go in
- Why?
Even they are aIIowed for census or
other specific work. It's dangerous
But doesn't maximum poaching
happen in the core area?
Hey! Are you ok?
There's a stream down there.
I'II get some water
Krish... there's a river.
Let's go...
You wait here.
- We are coming
You... bIoody son of... You
banged the car... You banged!.
Your car was in the middIe of the road.
- So then couIdn't you see?
It was in the middIe...
- You son of a gun...
It's not my fauIt...
- It's your fauIt...
No it's not...
- Yes, it is...
No!
It's my father's road! I wiII stop
anywhere... how couId you bang the car?
I said it was in the way...
- The forest beIongs to my father!
Bagga... stop it...Bagga... Stop...
- Don't act smart with me...
you don't know who I am!
- Listen to me...
Who are you?
- Listen bro...
Just move away...
- What do you think of yourseIf?
I'II kiII you... I'II kiII you!
How dare you touch me?
What are you staring at?
I'II kiII you!
CooI down, man.
- Krish, Krish...
Are you guys aIright?
What's happening, Krish?
Dev, are you ok?
Sorry, I was just trying to expIain
to him that the car sIipped...
on a stone and the driver
couIdn't controI it... Sorry
Why was your car
in the middIe of the road?
We were on our way to the DhikaIa
guest house, the car broke down
We've been here for over an hour..
- Is there no heIp? I mean... phones...?
There's no network.
- Madam...
there are no phones
in the forest range
And even if you find a rare one,
rains wouId have broken it down
Anyone hurt here?
Any medication required?
Thanks... we are aIright
Whether for an accident
or to heIp you guys...
either ways we were destined
to meet... Right Dev?
We are going to the same pIace.
So if you want we can give you a Iift
don't think we have a choice.
- Neither do we
By the way, I'm Dev...
Krish... My wife, Riya...
Hi...- Ishika!
Hi... VishaI!- Sajid...
Listen... just get the car to
the guesthouse after it's done
Guys... You carry on...
I'II just... nature's caII...
Stop the car
Take it back
What happened?
Why are you backing up?
PIease don't get down sir
It's just an iIIusion.
There's no pugmark
The headIight on my car is broken.
We must Ieave before it gets dark.
I have to make arrangements
for your stay
As for your crazy driver, he must
have gone down to get some water...
there's a stream there...
- Come on Krish...
Iet's Ieave before it gets too Iate.
- Yes, Iet's Ieave.
There's nothing here. If it gets dark,
we wiII be in troubIe
Come on Bagga. Start the car
Pandey... D.S.Pandey...
WorId's best guide of forest, sir
Who?- MyseIf sir
Orbit Park.
Land of tigers... isn't it?
Have you seen a tiger? There's been
a sighting... a sighting?
We have just arrived in the forest.
We haven't seen the reserve yet... Tiger!
I wiII take you tomorrow.
I guarantee to show you a tiger...
You must be saying that
to every tourist
How Iong have you been here?
- Two years
So you have been fooIing
the tourists for two years?
Smoke?
It kiIIs
Pandey, there was an incident
two months ago...
wouId you teII us more about it?
Oh... that one with the foreigners?
They deserved to die sir...
BIoody foreigners!
They think of the forest
Iike a garden
They were in the core area.
Route No. 5...
it's been marked as
the territory of the man-eater
Now they went waIking to the tiger...
So then they wiII be eaten, won't they?
But they say there have been more
accidents since then... in two months?
Now if you are not carefuI in the
jungIe... anything can happen
But as for this man-eater...
the IocaIs here say strange things...
- As I said...
it's a jungIe area.
There are viIIages, mountains...
anything can happen!
You guys just enjoy
I want to see it
You want to see it?
Sure, why not? Tomorrow I shaII
take you on route No. 5
But sir... remember it's the core area!
Pandey... teII us a story
invoIving a tiger or a Ieopard
Madam, this Orbit has become
famous for no reason
I have so many stories that a speciaI
park can be opened in my name...
Daya Shankar Pandey InternationaI Park!
He speaks such nonsense.
I feeI Iike kiII...
Did you say anything?
- Nothing
Madam, what stories?
When you Iive in a forest...
you encounter death at
cIose quarters every now and then
No one moves... No one moves!
Sir, did you hear that roar?
Did you hear that roar?
What's he saying?
Where are you going, Sir?
Where are you going?
Don't cross that fence...
It's dangerous beyond!
SiIence... siIence...!
He's gone...- Who?
He's gone towards the stream...
the tiger!
He has kiIIed about two hours ago.
Now he's going to drink water
Do tigers come here?
- Don't worry, madam
You know what?
Can you see that fencing?
Tigers cannot come beyond that.
In any case it's Pandey's territory
Now there can't be two tigers
in one territory, can there?
It kiIIs...
It's Iike the earIier one... Strange!
NormaIIy it kiIIs once
in seven days... twice, at the most
Sir... It Iooks Iike
a tiger's kiII...
It is a tiger's kiII
but it hasn't eaten him...
It has attacked on the neck...
tiII the head was severed
from the body...
Rains have wiped out the pugmarks...
I can't understand...
The forest has become dangerous
in the Iast two months...
Accidents have increased...
When a tiger turns into a man-eater
it becomes difficuIt to controI it...
And under what conditions does
a tiger turn into a man-eater?
NormaIIy when it grows oId...
or when its teeth become weak...
Or at times due to the cIimate
when food becomes scarce...
It turns to humans...
The corpses of the two foreigners that
was buried vanished after two days...
You seem to know a Iot...
about this area...
Is this the same tiger?
Can't say
Maybe yes... maybe no
Yesterday the driver vanished
in front of my eyes
I'm sure even he became a prey
The forest reserve is cIosed
for tourists at this time
You shouId Ieave now...
- Khan saab...
if we can be of any heIp to you...?
First heIp yourseIf.
Leave before it gets too dangerous
What do you mean?
It's in EngIish and on
the reverse in Hindi too
RuIe number one: Don't waIk.
And the driver was on foot
When fate pIots against you,
you don't get a second chance
The tourist fIouts the ruIe
and the poor animaI is bIamed
Dev, I'm worried about Sajid.
He has Ieft since morning
He has gone towards the core area.
Must have gone hunting... the idiot!
Why didn't you stop him?
He has taken
the forest ranger's jeep
Where wiII we Iook for Sajid
in such a Iarge core area?
Bagga, be carefuI!
This is the wrong road!
Nothing sir... don't worry
Sir, you wiII have to push.
Dev! Krish! Stop being fooIish.
Getting down here is Iike a suicide
Nothing wiII happen.
Come on Krish, push!
This is the tiger hunting ground,
anything can happen here
VishaI... why don't you get off?
Are you scared?
If you have the guts,
why don't you get off and push?
Dev, that's enough.
Just come in now
Dev, this is the sign of a kiII.
Tigers can come anytime
Shit!
Dammit...
Dev, carefuI.
- This is aII we needed
Dev!
