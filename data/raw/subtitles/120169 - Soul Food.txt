We have you down at 10:00
with Sterphan. Thanks. Bye.
I knew you'd call.
Simuel. Let me take your briefcase, baby.
Come on over here.
- Here we go.
I'm glad you made it.
There's something I wanna talk about.
Is that right?
- Yeah. Have a seat.
Why don't you let me hook up your fade?
Fade?
- Yeah.
Edge you up,
clean you up a little bit.
You're looking good,
but I can make it better.
Dig that.
What's this all about...hmm?
What do you mean?
You acting like I'm Big Willie or something.
You treating me all good.
What's going on?
Actually, l, um...
I need a favor.
Can you do me a favor?
When I first saw Simuel,
I knew he was up to no good.
He wanted Bird bad...
...and there wasn't nothing he
wouldn't do or say to get her.
Something bad was about to happen.
It was as plain to see
as those phat suits he wore.
What do you think?
You got much game, Bird.
I learned from you.
Heh heh heh.
But what's in this for me?
Bird.
Bird, where you at, baby?
I got some great news.
Bird.
I found a gig.
Yeah, Kenny called me yesterday,
and told me about a job...
...at the biggest in-house
printing company in town.
I went in cold...
...and they didn't even know
who the hell Kenny Simmons was.
I knew I had to kick some game.
- Right.
So I told the man
next to the goddamn man...
I was the best man for the job,
you know?
Yes.
So, finally, he looks at me...
...stands there, says...
...you're hired.
Right there on the spot.
Like he knew that I knew
that he knew that I knew...
...that l...was...the man. Yeah.
You are the man.
You're my man.
With enough hours,
you know what that means?
What?
Gonna get us our own place,
baby.
James Dawson,
phone call, line two.
James Dawson,
pick up line two.
You have a phone call.
Hey, Lem, I can't believe
you finished that Johnson job.
I didn't expect you to finish till tomorrow.
Good job.
Thanks a lot, man.
Can you run a 4 1/2 X 9 Carver?
I can work the Carver.
You sure?
- Sure.
Good man.
Lem Harris?
Simuel St. James...
Chief Executive of Sales and Marketing.
What's happening?
How you doing?
I've been hearing good things about you.
Especially the way you've been
handling those machines.
I'm no stranger to hard work.
That's good to know. Cigar?
Nah. I don't like cigars.
Sorry. You don't mind, do you?
Like I was saying,
it's always good to, you know...
...have enthusiastic, hard-working
employees like yourself.
Especially down there in printing.
I'm no stranger to hard work myself.
I'm like you.
I'm from the hood, too.
But I make $80,000 a year...
...because I was always
willing to sacrifice...
...whatever I had to to get what I wanted.
That's why brothers got to stick together--...
...pull one another up in a time of need.
Ahem.
The white man ain't gonna do it.
Sooner than you think, you'll
be helping another brother...
...just like I helped you.
What are you talking about?
I pulled some strings to get you hired.
What, you didn't know?
Kenny Simmons referred me.
Who?
No. I know your wife...
Bird.
She told me about
your little felony situation...
...and asked me to hook you up
in the printin' department.
Man, me and old Cola,
we, uh, we go way back.
Who the fuck is Cola?
No. Ha ha.
That's just something I used
to call her back in the day.
Since she got that body shaped
like a Coca-Cola bottle, huh?
She used to just make
a brother want to scream.
Motherfucker.
- Hey, come on.
I'll beat your ass.
Don't fuck with me.
You can forget about your job,
motherfucker.
I want to talk to you.
What is wrong with you?
Why are you fuckin' coming
in here tripping?
Think I'm not man enough
to find my own job?
I'm sorry.
You fucking that nigger?
- No.
What do you have to do for him?
Ain't no man gonna give you
a motherfucking thing free.
I didn't do nothing with him.
I just said I'd have dinner
with him. That's it. I'm sorry.
What the fuck is this, huh?
- It's nothing.
It ain't shit but a fuckin' bracelet.
This don't mean nothing.
Baby, I'm sorry.
Don't fucking touch me.
Don't fucking touch me.
Lem, I love you.
I just did this for us.
You stay the fuck away from me.
Motherfucker.
Lem. Lem.
Bird. Honey, it's OK.
Sweetie, you can talk to us.
Bird, your sister is
getting ready to call somebody.
I don't want no drama here.
Open up, Bird.
So Aunt Teri was calling in Cousin Blimp...
...to whup Uncle Lem's ass...
'cause she thought Lem had beat up Bird.
Big misunderstanding.
You knew things were gonna get
worse before they got better.
That's how it was when my aunts
fixed each other's messes.
Hey, no guns.
You hear me?
Give me a shot.
Hello. Maxine, is Kenny there?
This is Rick down at the bar.
Your brother-in-law is down here...
...and he's getting wasted.
Didn't know whether to call Bird or not.
You need to send somebody to get him.
There you go.
There he is...
Cousin Blimp.
He's one of those cousins
you don't see much...
'cause he's always spends
so much time in jail.
Of all the people Aunt Teri
could have called...
...to teach Lem a lesson...
I can't believe she called Blimp.
Give me some brews.
A couple for my boys, too.
Who's paying?
He's paying for it.
Yeah, right, motherfucker.
Don't shit me, motherfucker.
What is wrong with you, punk?
Hit that punk.
I'll blow your motherfucking brains out.
Should've brought my gat.
- Shut up.
Stop the car, Kenny.
Kenny, pull over.
Lem. Lem.
Ahmad, stay in the car.
That's my husband.
Wait. That's my husband.
No, no. Bird.
Wait, officer.
Please, somebody help.
Kicking Simuel's ass was one thing...
...but being an ex-felon with a gun...
Ianded Uncle Lem back where jail.
We're talking serious time.
Sure enough, the family
was starting to fall apart.
No.
What happened?
Hey.
Teri in?
She's at the hospital.
Any change?
No.
It's beautiful.
For your CD?
I don't know.
It's something I'm messing around with.
Hey... any news on your audition?
Get out of here.
Yeah,
I'm pretty happy about it.
I'm sure you are.
I was so scared.
You?
I gave two weeks at my firm today.
I quit.
Man, when your CD drops,
you are going to blow up.
I don't know about all that.
Let's celebrate.
Miles...
I'm moving out this weekend.
Teri and I living under
the same roof together...
...is not working.
Teri's tough.
You letting her run you out,
huh?
You're damn right.
Besides that,
I need my own space.
Always on the go. I can't stay
in one place too long.
I got this new gig, so--.
So you gotta go.
I don't know.
It's always been like that.
But, you know, we're all cool.
There's no hostilities or anything like that.
It's just...
...when it's time to go...
...it's time to go.
Ha. That's bullshit.
Excuse me?
Sounds like bullshit.
I mean, that's, uh...
...a lonely life.
You should...
...stop pretending you
don't need anybody...
'cause you're just lying to yourself.
That's how I see it.
I'm going up to the studio.
You never know.
You have to just be yourself.
Miles?
Uncle Miles, we're home.
He must be upstairs
in the studio on the roof.
The studio. Let's go.
I love it out here, Aunt Teri.
I know you love it out here.
Um, we gotta go.
But, Aunt Teri, I thought--...
Back to your house.
- Aunt Teri--.
No. Let's just go back, OK?
I don't know why we left
Aunt Teri's house so fast...
...or why Teri was so upset all of a sudden.
All I know is she didn't speak
the whole trip.
We headed back to my house.
Everybody was getting together...
...for my Mom and Dad's
11th-year anniversary party.
Happy anniversary.
One more kiss.
All right. Look out now.
Watch me now.
Where's my baby?
There sure seemed to be
a lot of tension in the air...
...especially between Teri and Miles.
At one point,
I think I saw Aunt Teri crying.
Not even my mama could say why.
Good God almighty.
At least my folks were getting along...
...which is always cool.
Ahem.
Honey, uh...
...why don't you get everybody
in the kitchen so we can talk?
Want to dance?
Teri, you OK?
Are you all right?
After all these years,
you and Max are still together.
I still envy that.
I always thought if you and I
had gotten married...
...my life would be different.
But it wouldn't.
I'd find a way to screw it up.
Teri, you can't...
What y'all doing in here?
Just talking about this cake.
Mmm.
It was good.
Yeah, real good.
Since we're all together...
I feel it's a good time to talk
about Mama's hospital bills.
Y'all know her insurance
won't cover everything.
We're talking about it
since the five of us are here.
Maybe we can all pitch in,
take care of this tonight?
Yes.
What about that money Mama has stashed?
That's just a myth.
So...
I felt that Teri and Miles
could pay for everything.
Then we can pay you back
in installments or--.
Don't you start running
that game on me again.
Expect me to bail Lem out of jail, too?
Lem doesn't have anything to do with this.
We can pay for Mama's
bills by selling the big house.
What?
We're not selling the house.
Mama and Daddy saved
their whole life for that house.
We can't even agree on anything
as small as Sunday dinners.
Nobody's paying for the taxes
or utilities except me.
We can finally put Uncle Pete
in a home like we discussed.
Uncle Pete in a home?
Mama would kill us.
You are tripping.
I'm selling the house.
You're not selling the house.
I'm the guardian of her estate,
so I make the decisions.
Teri,
listen to what they're saying.
Your mama worked hard to keep
that house in the family.
For everyone-- you and your family--.
Fuck the family.
I let the family in my house.
You know what?
The family fucked my husband.
Yeah. Faith fucked my husband.
Miles.
Teri.
What are you gonna say?
Teri.
- 'Teri' what?
Can we talk about this?
- Talk about what? Fuck you.
Teri. Whoa. Teri.
Let go. Let go.
My goodness.
Get out.
I'm so sorry.
Get out.
Get the fuck out.
I never meant to. God.
God.
God.
It's OK. It's OK, Teri.
It's gonna be OK.
Second floor nursing station, maintenance.
Second floor nursing station, maintenance.
ln the five weeks
Big Mama was in that coma...
...every grownup in the family
managed somehow to go crazy.
I know, 'cause I just about went crazy, too.
You...
You were...
...here...
...weren't you?
Yeah.
Everybody was worried about you,
but not me.
I knew you'd come around.
I love you, Big Mama.
The family's...
...a mess, isn't it?
A lot of bad things happened
while you were gone.
If you let...
...bad things stop you...
...you won't be here...
...for the good things.
I'm tired, baby.
My soul is tired.
I need you to do something for me.
Only you can do it.
I need you to--.
Big Mama, what's wrong?
Big Mama. Big Mama.
Son, you'll have to wait outside.
It's OK, son.
We'll take good care of her.
Excuse me.
Dr. Horowitz...
...please report to the nursing station.
Dr. Horowitz to the nursing station.
Why.
Should I feel.
Discouraged?
Why.
Should the shadows come.
And why.
Should my heart.
Be lonely.
And long.
For heaven.
And home.
When Jesus is.
My potion.
A constant friend.
Is he.
His eye.
Is on.
The sparrow.
And I know.
He watches me.
His eyes...
Pulling together in times of need--.
That had always been Big Mama's job...
...but who was gonna do it
now that she was gone?
And I know.
He watches.
Me.
Mama ain't even lukewarm
in the ground yet...
...and that damn girl got her house for sale.
Uncle Pete?
What you doing out of your room?
We going to the creek today,
Joe?
We can catch some trout for dinner.
Put it in the iron pot...
...sear it with lard or cooking oil, Joe.
No.
I'm Maxine, Uncle Pete.
Joe's daughter.
She's gone.
She's dead.
Remember Daddy used to raise hogs?
He'd gut 'em...
...and he'd cure the cut-up meat
in brine, and...
...and put 'em in the smokehouse
for sausages.
Daddy's gone now.
So you got to take care of me now, Joe.
That's right.
I'm gonna take good care of you.
Come on, now, Uncle Pete.
You want some catfish?
I'm happy we're doing this.
Yeah, me, too.
Look. There she is.
Teri.
Hi.
We didn't order yet,
'cause we were waiting for you.
What's up?
Look, Teri, I know you're mad at the world...
...for what's happened
between you and Miles.
I understand.
But you're taking it out
on the family, and that's wrong.
Sorry.
We're gonna stop
the sale of Mama's house.
I went to Kenny's lawyer...
...and I drew up a motion
to cease and desist.
Sorry.
OK.
OK?
- I'm sorry, too.
Teri, don't leave.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I gotta go to the bathroom.
You OK?
Lem's gonna be a daddy.
So you're the fish in Mama's dream.
Yeah.
Maxie, I miss him so much.
I knew, Bird...
...but you can't call your ex...
...to help your husband
find a job behind his back.
A man has to be a man.
If he feels you take that away
from him, he has nothing.
Like with Mama.
Remember when Daddy lost
all that money gambling?
Remember?
- Yes.
She didn't trip.
She did what she had to do
and left him with his dignity.
You see what I'm saying?
Men need that.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
I'm gonna be an auntie.
God.
I wish I could be like you.
- Please.
So does Teri. That's why
she acts the way she does.
Girl, you got your own shop...
...and Teri's got a great job at the firm.
Shoot, all I got is a husband
and some kids...
...but they badasses.
Mama always said you were
the strongest one in the family.
I want to say thank you
for always supporting me.
You're my sister, girl.
I love you, Maxie.
I love you, too.
Come here, girl.
It's gonna be all right.
- Yeah.
Just fine.
We gotta get some bottles,
some Pampers.
You ready for that?
- I guess.
Get ready.
It's Teri Joseph for Jonathan Oliver, please.
Teri must have felt really bad...
...about what she did to Lem...
'cause she called in a favor
from some downtown big shot.
Um, I have a favor.
And that last steal.
The way you pulled up and scored.
Mom.
Sweet move, baby.
But, Mama,
why you always gotta be so loud?
I don't care what they say.
You my baby,
and I'm proud of you.
Can you hook up a victory dinner?
Sure, baby, anything you want.
Think I could grub on some lima beans...
...neck bones,
greens with some hot sauce...
...hot cakes,
and some fried chicken.
Dang.
All of that?
All of that.
All right.
Besides, I haven't cooked like that since...
So when you want to have
this victory dinner?
Sunday...
...at Big Mama's.
You up to something.
I carried you for nine months,
went through...
...Twenty three hours,
45 minutes, 10 seconds of labor.
Wiped your little butt...
...while your lil' ding-a-ling
pee-peed in my face.
So Mama knows
when you're up to something.
You're trying to get everybody
together for Sunday dinner.
Big Mama wants me to.
It's what she was trying
to tell me before she died.
You liked that last shot?
Man,
that last shot was the bomb.
Flow, you know.
Keep doing like that,
and when you get older...
...you're gonna get a fat contract, right?
Buy a house. Get me a Lexus.
- A Lexus.
And a fur,
you know what I'm saying?
Guys, that's sounding good,
but I'm still missing a note.
Let's do it again.
Let's try it again.
Here we go.
One, two, three, four.
Girl.
I care about you.
I'm there for you.
So why don't you care.
For me.
Like I care about you?
Good, good, better.
Let's take a break, all right?
Leave the little man to his business.
I'm glad you could make it,
shorty.
I'm glad, too.
It's been tough...
...with school and working
at the shop afterwards.
And figuring out what to do
with that loot Big Mama left me.
What loot?
Dead presidents?
- Cash?
When did she leave it to you?
- Day she died.
I was the only one at the hospital.
Big mama told me where
she stashed a lot of money.
How much money you talkin' about?
Lots. I mean beaucoup.
Beaucoup?
- Beaucoup.
Maybe you could help me
decide what to do with it.
This isn't the money from the will?
Aunt Teri, you're the smartest in the family.
You know that's right.
If I was your son,
would you invest in my future?
Do the right thing for family?
- Absolutely.
If you help me,
I can give you a third.
Like a fee.
A fee?
- Yeah.
Then you could pay Big Mama's
bills and not sell the house.
I can give you a percentage
if you help me invest it.
You can use the money
to promote your CD.
Have you told anybody else about this?
No, but I'd give you some of it.
You could pay Aunt Teri's loan.
Why don't you tell me...
- ...where the money is?
Let's get it.
- When's a good time?
Sunday at 3:00...
...at Big Mama's.
What y'all doing here?
Just cooking a little Sunday dinner.
All right.
Let the ladies handle this.
After all the hard work
is done, you're gonna come in.
You can work hard with
that remote and watch football.
I can do that?
- Yeah.
You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
You don't need anything?
- No.
Thank you.
You want me to start these dumplings?
Yeah, but watch that measuring.
You know how you are.
I'm gonna kick your butt.
Why didn't you tell me?
This would be the test...
...to see if 40 years of tradition
and Mama's soul food...
...could pull our family back together again.
Aunt Teri, what's up?
There's a car outside.
Is your mom here?
Somebody cooking?
Go in the kitchen and see.
Smells in the kitchen
bringing back the good old days.
Mmm, dumplings,
deep-fried catfish...
...macaroni and cheese,
and sweet cornbread.
The kind Big Mama made look
like pound cake for the kids.
I wanted the good old feelings back, too.
And so did Big Mama.
Miles, what's up, man?
How you doing?
What's going on here, Ahmad?
We having Sunday dinner.
We got some string beans,
catfish...
...chicken and dumplings,
some cornbread.
I shouldn't be here.
What's happening?
When'd you get out of jail?
What's going on?
I wanna talk to you.
How you doing, Miles?
Have a seat.
We're going to serve dinner.
What's going on in there?
We're having Sunday dinner.
Sunday dinner?
I fucked up, huh?
How's Bird doing?
She's in there.
Why don't you go ask her?
Looks like a family thing in there.
I don't want to butt in.
Why not?
You're family.
Hey, Ahmad, um...
I know I let you down,
and I'm sorry.
But I want you to know,
I ain't beat on your auntie.
I pushed her,
and that was bad enough...
...but I didn't hit her.
I would never, ever hit a woman.
Do you believe me?
Ahmad, your mama said go wash
and get ready for dinner.
I'll leave you two alone.
Boo, you're home?
Baby.
I missed you so much.
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
Are you OK?
I'm fine, baby.
I messed up, baby.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
- I love you, too.
I have something to tell you.
Ahmad? Ahmad?
I can't even believe she's here.
Come on.
Hey, Faith, what's up?
Ahmad, what's going on?
How come everybody's here?
We just having Sunday dinner.
Sunday dinner?
Yeah. We got some
chicken and dumplings...
...some string beans,
catfish, some cor--.
Not cool, Ahmad.
I'm out of here.
Faith.
Wait. Please, stay.
Please?
Dear Lord...
...thank you for allowing us
another day on Earth--...
...another day to glorify your name...
...and sanctify ourselves with your mercy.
I'm grateful that the people
I love most in the world...
...are here to celebrate life
and the lessons as it unfolds.
And let one of those lessons
be acceptance and love...
...so we can be a family again...
...and love each other like we used to.
In Christ Jesus' name, amen.
Amen.
Amen.
It's so good to be back.
I missed this place.
I've got my favorite food.
I have a surprise for everyone later...
...but for now,
why don't we just eat?
Amen to that.
Everybody, um,
I got my job back.
That's good, Lem.
Congratulations.
That's great.
They asked a brother back...
...because they know I'm a good,
strong, skilled worker.
That's right.
How'd you get out of jail?
I don't even know.
Somebody talked to somebody,
and the charges got dropped.
Here I am.
Glad to have you home, brother.
That's right. My boo is home.
Actually, I called a friend at
the D.A.'s office for a favor.
I felt bad.
You should feel bad.
Because of you,
I spent weeks in jail.
You should be thankful.
Now you can take care
of your pregnant wife.
Teri,
mind your own damn business.
Didn't nobody ask you for your help.
Worry about your husband
and why he's sleeping with her.
Gee.
No, sit.
Let her go if she wants to.
Teri, I'm sorry,
but she's always running away.
You're family,
and we're gonna deal with this.
Baby, get me some more peas.
And take your sister.
Always worrying about
somebody else's business.
You need to take care
of your own husband.
So was that it, Miles?
I didn't take care of you?
We haven't been happy for a long time now.
We used to have so much fun.
I don't know what happened.
It seems that everything I love...
I lose.
Well, um, ahem.
Good luck with Mother Joe's money.
M-Mother Joe's money?
What are you talking about?
Supposedly, Mama has
some large amount of money...
...stashed someplace in the house
she was saving for Ahmad and...
...that's why we're all here tonight.
Ahmad? Get in here.
Ahmad?
Right now.
Where's this money
Mother Joe supposedly left you?
There isn't any money.
I made it up.
You made it up?
Ahmad, what have I told you about lying?
You know better.
It's not my fault.
It's all y'all's fault.
Y'all messed up the family.
Can't you see that?
Big Mama wanted me to get you
together for a Sunday dinner.
I didn't know how to do that,
because all y'all do is fight.
So I lied about the money so you'd come...
...so we could be a family again.
Y'all know that's what Big Mama wanted.
Baby...come here.
It's OK.
Y'all smell that?
Smell what?
It's coming from the kitchen.
You mess with the stove?
I'll go look.
Shit. Come on.
Let me get some water.
Get back. Get back.
My God.
Get back. Get back.
Look out. Look out.
Whoa. Whoa. Look out.
It's coming from the back of the stove.
It ain't working.
My God.
The house.
Wait.
The house.
It's getting out of hand.
We need an extinguisher.
Yeah.
No.
My God.
My goodness.
No.
What happened?
I don't know.
I...
I forgot.
I left the towel on the stove.
Ahmad...
Uncle Pete, are you all right?
Got a little on your face.
He didn't mean nothing.
This is, uh, my surprise,
everybody.
Uncle Pete.
Uncle Pete?
I'm--I'm sorry, man.
Look at this.
What?
- What?
Look at all this money.
Yay.
Big Mama really had
hidden a pile of money.
It was in the last place we'd look--.
Uncle Pete's TV.
Now I understand
what soul food was all about.
During slavery, black folks
didn't have a lot to celebrate.
Cooking was how we expressed
love for each other.
That's what those Sunday dinners meant.
More than just eating.
It was a time for sharing
our joys and sorrows.
Something old folks say
is missing in today's families.
Things got better for my family after that.
Even though Miles
and Aunt Teri broke up...
...that doesn't stop
Miles from coming over...
...and filling his belly
with Mama's soul food.
Lem and Bird are doing good.
They got their own place...
...and they're expecting
their baby any day now.
My mama and Aunt Teri are
cool again, at least for now.
And Faith is finally a part of the family, too.
As you can see,
we didn't sell the big house.
No way, no how.
Even though we miss Big Mama's
cooking, laughter, and love...
...none of us feel like life cheated her.
She accomplished what
she set out to do--...
...to build a strong family
with a rich tradition...
...and to leave love in her footprints.
Thanks, Big Mama.
You taught me everything.
Everything you've given me.
I'll always keep it inside.
And you're the driving force in my life.
Yeah-eah-eah.
There isn't anything
or anyone that I could be.
And it just wouldn't feel right.
If I didn't have you by my side.
You were there for me.
To love and care for me.
When skies were gray.
Whenever I was down.
You were always there.
To comfort me.
And no one else can be
what you have been to me.
You will always be.
You will always be.
The girl in my life.
For all times.
Mama.
Mama.
You know.
I love you.
You know I love you.
You know I love you.
Mama.
Mama, you're the queen of my heart.
You are.
Your love is like tears from the stars.
Your love is like tears from the stars.
Mama, I just want you to know.
Mama, I just want you to know.
Lovin' you is like food to my soul.
Lovin' you is like food to my soul.
You are the food.
To my soul.
Yes, you are.
Don't you stop it.
Don't you stop what you're doin'.
You don't really want to stop.
No, you don't.
Don't you stop it.
Don't you stop what you're doin'.
Yeah, yeah.
You don't really want to stop.
Check it out, yeah, come on.
Whether you like it hard over live guitars.
Anything dropped.
If it's hot, it's ours.
If it's not, it's yours.
We on the job.
Everybody eatin'.
Everybody involved.
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap.
Bad boy, stop.
What's the chance of that?
We don't stop.
So checks, advances, and stacks.
And we don't have to answer to jack.
No wonder we had this rap shit locked.
For eight straight summers.
Pull up at the party.
Eight straight hummers.
Six be the sixth, seventh,
and eighth wonders.
Pop corks,
we be the toast of New York.
And out West,
we want y'all to understand.
All we wanna do is make you dance.
We know the song ain't done wrong.
When the party is hot.
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?
Don't you stop it.
Don't you stop what you're doin'.
You don't really want to stop.
Nah.
Don't you stop it.
Don't you stop what you're doin'.
You don't really want to stop.
You can pump this in your jeep.
On an off-road.
Pump this through your Bose.
On the way to the toll.
Bang this in you're B.N.O.
When you at home.
On the six-four sittin' on chrome.
Yo, we don't stall, we ball.
While you playin' the wall.
We in the middle of the dance floor.
Gettin' off.
We got a bunch of hot chicks.
Gettin' live with us.
At the end of the night.
They gonna slide with us.
Don't you stop it.
Don't you stop what you're doin'.
You don't really want to stop.
No, baby, uh-uh.
Don't you stop it.
Don't you stop what you're doin'.
You don't really want to stop.
