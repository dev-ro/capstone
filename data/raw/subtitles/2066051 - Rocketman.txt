How long is this gonna take?
That's really up to you.
All right, then.
I know how this bit goes.
My name is Elton Hercules John.
And I'm an alcoholic.
And a cocaine addict.
And a sex addict.
And a bulimic.
Mostly shopaholic
who has problems with weed.
Prescription drugs.
And anger management.
Why are you here now?
Well, my dealer was out of town,
I thought this seemed
like a good alternative.
I'm here because I
want to get better.
What were you like
as a child, Elton?
As a child?

Reggie!
You're late!
I've had to throw your dinner
in the bin! Get inside.
Is he back?
What am I, thin air?
Wouldn't get your hopes up.
He's very unreliable
and very selfish.
But will you send him up
if I'm already in bed?
Reggie, move.
I wanna get this
done before I go out.
All right, I'm done.
Put it away before you go out.
Mum, I've got to go.
Where's my car keys?
What?
Did I do something wrong?
Bloody hell, Sheila.
Maybe we should get
him some lessons.
Love to!
Get him out from under my feet.
Go on, play it again.
I wanna play it for Dad.
Managed to drag
yourself home, then.
Hello, Stanley.
- How are you, Ivy?
- Like you care.
Come on. Lettin' in the draft.
How long you're back?
I've got a couple of weeks leave.
Reggie's not long gone to bed.
Go on.
Pop up, say hello.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Any dinner left?
Or have you fed it
all to that boy?
My dad was passionate about
family and music.
Talk for hours about jazz.
Was always hugging me.
I was very lucky.
Was actually a very happy child.
Dad, is it true you play piano?
I'm saving to get lessons.
If you want to sit in here,
you'll have to be quiet.
Listen to my music.
I like this one, Dad.
Never, ever touch my collection
without asking.
When are you going to hug me?
Don't be soft.
What you still doing up?
Learning.
Turn off the light,
go to sleep.
Crumbs! That was energetic.
Play another one!
The Moonlight Sonata, Reggie.
Mum,
my piano teacher thinks I'm
good enough for a scholarship
at the Royal Academy of Music.
The Royal Academy of Music?
It has a nice ring to it.
"Royal".
Scissors.
- What d'you think?
- Uh...
The red one's good.
It's only on Saturdays.
Things to do on weekends.
Can't just drop everything.
I'll take you.
Where are you off to?
Dunno.
Haven't decided yet.
But whatever it is,
you're not invited.
Reggie's piano teacher thinks he's
good enough for a scholarship.
Really?
You think he's got
that kind of talent?
'Course he has.
But you'd know that
if you took the slightest
bit of interest in me
or this family.
Stop looking at that.
You're not a girl.
Can we go home?
Home? No going home.
This is your life.
Never get over that silly shyness.
But Mum says I'm never...
Now everybody's frightened
at the beginning.
You play at being confident.
Life gives you very few chances,
Reggie, and this is one of yours.
You show 'em you can be good
as they are, better, number one.
You can do that, can't you?
Yeah, I suppose.
Good. Go on, then. Here.
This is for a bag of chips
and your bus fare home.
Reginald Dwight?
- Yes.
- How do you do?
Good, thank you.
Take your coat off.
Did you not bring
something to play?
Didn't know I had to.
I see, well...
So, can you show me anything
so I can get a sense
of where you're up to?
Why have you stopped?
That's as far as you got.
You might have a good
memory and a good ear,
but you've an awful
lot of work to do.
So, wrists and back straight.
Let's start with the C major scale,
both hands, two octaves.
Hands off the table, Reginald.
Stop making that noise!

Hello, son, I'm Fred.
I'm a friend to your mum's.
You've tied me down
with that kid years ago.
And now I've finally
got a reason to leave.
And be rid of you and
this bloody house!
He didn't even give
me hug goodbye.
He's no good at
showing affection.
Never has been.
I wish I was someone else.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, how do you think I felt?
I was a kid.
Heartbroken.
People don't care
though, do they?
Anyway...
I'd discovered records.
And rock and roll.

It's fantastic!
Are you serious about wanting
to be a rock and roller?
Yeah, of course.
Got to get you
the proper haircut, eh?
Can I get it cut like Elvis?
Enjoy it while it lasts.
He's like my side of the family.
He'll be bald as an egg
by the time he's 20.
Congratulations to Dave
who's won four pork chops
off a pan of fry minced
and a string of sausages.
Hey, thank you all. Thank you!
Now, Sheila and Fred's
boy is gonna sing us
a couple of songs on the piano.
Reggie Dwight!
Go on, boy!
Hello.
Bloody hell. Have you got a fag?
Rubbish!
Reg, Reg!
Play the one I like.
Excuse me.
- You can't put that there.
- Why not?
It'll get knocked off.

You have an amazing voice.
And I'm telling you, there is
something special that happens
when you sing our songs.
Yeah, but Dick said, he said my

- Hi.
- Hello.
- You were amazing.
Thank you.
All right!
Enough of this bullshit!
Who wants to go to a
party at Mama Cass'?
I'm so drunk!
And Doug just lent me his car!
How cool is this, man?
Yeah, great.
Probably Dylan's here somewhere.
Uh...
I'm gonna go in the
teepee with Heather.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Right.
'Kay.
You'll be all right, won't you?
- Yeah, 'course.
- Yeah, yeah.
So, we still gonna go to Tower
Records tomorrow then?
Uh, well, she's talking about
going to some place called
Paradise Cove tomorrow.
We'll go another time though.
- Yeah, 'course.
- Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
America, man.
Wide open spaces.
- Beautiful girls.
- Mm.
It's a dream come true.
Cheers.
Let's stay here forever.

the kindness of strangers.
John Reid.
Elton.
I know it seems a bit
overwhelming at first,
but, eh, something makes me
think you'll get used to it.
And in fact, I predict you could be
the best selling artist in America,
if you desire.
So you like the songs then?
Not quite as much as the singer.
But you don't believe
that's what happened
at the Troubadour
tonight, do you?
Look, I'm in music management,
and let me tell you.
There are moments
in a rock star's life
that define who he is.
And how people
perceive him as he
ascends into the heavens.
You lit the blue touch paper.
How we can all see you shooting
light and color and
magic into the night sky.
Where there was darkness,
there was no you.
Elton John.
You can do anything you want.
You can be anyone you want.
And it's gonna be a wild ride.

The review from the L.A. Times
has been syndicated.
- Okay.
- Things are going crazy.
I've extended our stay.
We're in San Francisco
tomorrow for three nights.
- After that, we fly to NYC,
- Slow down.
then we're back here for
two more shows and then
Dick wants us back in London
to start the new album.
"Rejoice."
"Rock music has a new star.
"He is Englishman,
"Elton John, a 23-year-old
"whose debut at the Troubadour
was in every way magnificent."
Whoo!
It's happening, guys.
Just remember,
when you get back,
four shows, you owe me.
- You said...?
- Four!
- Did... you said four shows?
- Yes.
So...
Will I see you when I get back?
Now, don't worry about me.
Go and enjoy your moment.
- That's what's important.
- Come to London with me.
I can't, but, eh,
next time I'm there,
I'll look you up.
I promise.
Hey. I've opened
the fucking house.
Don't be a bummer.
I'm gonna watch you in front.
Oh, I love 'em.
These are extremely stylish boots
of my own design.
Can you even play
the piano on that?
- This is never gonna last.
- I know.
Let's just enjoy it
while we can, all right?

Hello.
What are you doing here?
Business.
And I promised if I was ever
in town, I'd look you up.
How long you staying?
Well, not sure, it depends.
Don't make me beg.
I've been hearing
your songs everywhere.
Makes it very hard to stop
thinking about you.
Really?
Elton, what's going on?
Are we going again
or shall we go for a pint?
Yeah, no, yeah,
you should go for a pint.
What do you want, Elton?
Uh, dinner with you.
So humble, it's embarrassing.
You're a millionaire rock star
who lives at home with his mum.
Things are serious now.
Be brave.
Think big.

No one's getting
phased out, Dick.
Elton feels things'll
run more smoothly
if he has personal management.
There's never been
a problem before.
And there isn't one now.
Look, there's loads of work.
Commitments, tours, etcetera.
That's what I'll be doing.
Personal management.
Taking care of things.
Is that right?
You realize I've got
a contract with Elton.
I've had that looked into.
And now my client
is quite entitled
to take on outside
representation.
That's what you think.
You fucking poofter!
And you.
You're happy with this
arrangement, are ya?
Eh?
After all these years?
It's nothing personal, Dick.
Come on, Ray.
Best of luck to you, Elton.
Your very expensive painting
is upside down.
- After you, Mr. James.
- Thank you, Ray.
Well.
That was absolutely horrible.
Don't worry, it's business.
Dick's a big boy. He'll be fine.
Mr. Reid, Lord Graves'
office have called about
the Royal Variety performance.
Apparently, the Queen Mother
is a big fan.
Couldn't we have kept on Ray?
He's such a lovely guy.
"Lovely guy" is not a job.
This is a crucial time, Elton.
You and I are gonna
have to be more careful
'cause the papers have
been sniffin' around.
We can't give them
anything to speculate on.
I'm thinking of getting
someone in as your girlfriend.
- That seem a bit excessive?
- No, no, no, no.
This is your career.
And our business at stake.
If our sleeping
arrangements get out...
- all of this is gone.
- Right.
And you're gonna have
to talk to your parents.
Make sure they know what to say.
Those are the first
doors reporters knock on.
Hello, Reg.
Dad.
Well...
Come on in.
Well, those are very fancy shoes.
Oh, well, yeah.
I brought you something.
Why are you here, Reg?
Ah, the boys.
Dad, there's
a Rolls Royce outside.
Stephen, Geoff...
This is your brother, Reggie.
Half brother.
Not actually called
Reggie anymore.
Thought maybe once
I'm back from touring,
you and I could get together
if you'd like.
I could get you some
tickets to my next concert.
Not-Not really my thing.
Is it true you're worth
25 million pound?
D'you know,
I don't actually know.
They're really proud of you.
Mmm.
We've even got some of your
records.
Why don't you go
get the, uh, album.
Grab us a pen.
You probably get asked
this all the time.
But would you, uh...
Would you mind signing this?
Yeah, 'course.
Oh, no. Would you make it out
to, uh, Arthur?
He's, uh, one of the
blokes from work.
He's a big fan.
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm.
Perfect.
Right.
Well, looks like things
worked out really well
 second time 'round, Dad.
Yeah, I suppose they have.
You know, not everybody
gets a second chance.
Always loved meeting
a real live pop star.
Sure.
Thanks, Dad.
Bye.
- When I grow up, Dad...
- Inside.
What are you doing
without your shoes on?
What've you got to do to get
a fucking drink around here, eh?
Will you stop sulking?
It has to be done
whether you like it or not.
Are you gonna be scared
of her your whole life?
- Right stop the car!
- Elton.
I said stop the car!
You're on stage in 15 minutes.
You're the big shot manager.
You make my excuses.
Tell them I'm in disposed
breaking my mother's heart!
Elton.
Elton!
Drive around, Dennis.
Liberace!
Pinner 97 double 5.
Mum, it's me.
I know who you are.
Well, I've got
something to tell you.
Reggie, we're gonna miss the
bit of the show with you on.
Look, shut-shut up, Mum!
I'm not on telly yet, am I?
I'm talking to you.
I...
Me and John, we...
Well, the thing is...
I'm...
a homosexual.
A poofter.
A fairy.
A queen.
Well, say something!
Oh, for God's sake, I know that.
Known for years.
You don't mind?
Frankly, I don't care.
But I'd rather you keep that
sort of thing to yourself.
I just hope you realize
you're choosing a life
of being alone forever.
You'll never be loved properly.
Right. Got to go.
She said I'll never be loved.
Don't ever put me
in this position again.
You're on stage in ten minutes.
So get over yourself
and do the show.
We're running a business
here, you fuckin' idiot.
Don't ever put your hands on me.
Real love's hard to come by.
So you find a way
to cope without it.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Got the number one album
in America, again.
I'm about to embark on the highest
grossing tour in rock history.
I'm personally responsible
for five percent
of all record sales
on the entire planet.
And I have the biggest
headdress known to man.
So yeah, I think I'm okay, Bernie.
Right, used to just be
the two of us.
Now there's busloads of
people just to do the music.
Hang on, hang on,
don't you wanna just...
go out there and sing without
this ridiculous paraphernalia?
You know, just...
be yourself Reg?
Why the fuck
would I want that, Bernie?
You know, you wouldn't
say this shit to me
if you were a real friend.
People don't pay to
see Reginald Dwight.
They pay to see Elton John!
Don't ever tell me
how to do my fucking job!
Break a leg.
You don't have to put up with
this, Reg.
Write the fucking lyrics, Bernie!
Let me deal with the rest.
- Sorry.
- I know.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please welcome

Where am I?
At your house, in L.A., Mr. John.
Right.
I'll put some coffee on.
Telling you, I've been thinking,
maybe we should
quit the booze for
a couple of days,
take some quality time together.
Good afternoon.
Mr. Reid.
- What d'you think you're doing, John?
- Just a bit of rock and roll.
Rock and roll is not shagging your
secretary in front of the pool boys!
Rock and roll's getting you
out of your bed in the morning.
Arranging 250 gigs in
26 different countries.
Rock and roll's actually
112 employment contracts.
Insurance. Copyright indemnity.
Renegotiating your
previously insane contract
and wiping your ass.
You know what you do, Elton,
is play the piano,
but for me, rock and roll
is an $87 million-a-year industry
So, well, maybe all I do
is play the piano,
but you know what else I do?
Hmm?
I pay, John.
For everything.
Including this house
which I'd like you to leave, now.
You may still be my manager
but you and me are finished.
- You're so predictable.
- No. Not predictable.
I want to be by myself.
Not with some asshole!
Who doesn't give a shit about me!
And takes the piss!
Day after day!
Get out!
Yoohoo!
Elton!
Look at that!
What are they doing here?
You told me to hire a jet
and fly them over for the gig.
No. No, next week, John.
It is next week.
I'm gonna go and
fix them a drink.
Darling, why don't you
clean yourself up?
Because you fuckin' stink.
Sheila!
It's been too long.
Hello, look at this,
you lovely lot.
Here we are.
Oh, I can't believe
how nicely you look.
I know.
How you doing? Good to see ya.
Elton.
- Hello, Mum.
- Elton, darling, you remember
- the Andersons from next door.
- Ah, yes! The Andersons.
How can we forget
the Andersons?
- Hello.
- Hello.
And what a shy,
little boy you were.
Look at you now.
Elton, you must give them a tour.
- Yes, right now, come on.
- Yup.
Everyone, Elton is giving a tour!

- Yes, yes, sorry. You were saying?
I was saying that I think
I need a break.
You need to take a break?
I think that I just need to
go and sort myself out a bit.
What?
I'm going home... for a while.
Well, that's nice for you.
Why can't we just, you know,
both of us,
just disappear together?
My ranch.
We'll go to my ranch,
we'll hide away.
We can write like we did.
Like we used to.
We should go home, Elton.
Reconnect.
No, you should go.
There are other writers
I'd like to work with anyway.
Do me good.
Collaborate with other people.
I think it's a really good idea.

What do you really want?
What a shy, little boy you were.
I'm going home for a while.
What d'you want? I'm busy.

The problem... is you...
have never understood me

And you know what, I should've
sacked you when you left me.
I am glad I left you. It means
I can maintain some objectivity
in your self-indulgent,
myopic little world.
Get in the studio,
make some music or don't.
I don't care.
Well, you will
when your money runs out.

Did being married
make you happy?
Not really, I'm gay.
Hello, Mum.
Sir, would you like me
to refill your glass?
Maybe a bit later, thank you.
How you doing, son?
- You all right?
- Yeah, good.
Just talking about poor Renata.
Such a lovely woman.
Divorce can be so painful.
- Yeah.
- Anyway...
A celebration is in order.
We found a lovely
villa by the sea.
Be good if you would
talked to John today,
get the money arranged.
Ooh, can't risk losing this one.
Yeah, oh, in Menorca.
It's a lovely place.
You should see it.
Menorca, eh?
What do you want
to go there for?
- 'Cause you're driving me away.
- Mmm.
Every time we open a paper,
there's something about you,

Typical that you'd say
something like that about me.
When I've given up
so much for you.
What have you given up for me?
Your father for a start.
You really are a
heartless monster.
You know, I don't live my life
in black and white.
And I do not want your fucked

You know, I am so sick of
running away from who I am.
There's nothing
wrong with success.
Or pleasure. In fact,
why am I apologizing for it?
Mum, I have fucked
everything that moves.
And I've taken every
drug known to man.
All of them.
D'you know what?
I enjoyed every last minute of it.
Ever since you first dangled
your fat little legs
in front of a piano,
you've been lucky.
You've never worked hard for
a bloody thing in your life.

Does it matter?
Hates my fucking guts.
Nobody hates you, Elton.
Campaign to cure yourself
is going well.
What are you doing here, Bernie?
Hmm?
You left when it suited you.
What, now you come
back to lecture me?
'Cause the thing is,
the first time we actually got
anywhere, you left, didn't you?
Some girl was more
important to you than me.
And all those legends
who were welcoming us in.
You left me at the most
important time, Bernie.
When did you give up?
If you don't care
about yourself,
how do you expect
anyone else to?
Whenever I needed you most,
- you weren't there.
- It's not weak

- I have worked my balls off

Day in, day out.
For years.
And now, it's me that can't
walk down the streets.
It's me who doesn't have a life.
'Cause I don't get to sit around
with my feet on a desk
chewing on the end
of a fucking pencil.
"Just write the lyrics, Bernie,
I'll take care of everything."
That was a test!
You should've known.
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

Bernie betrayed me
like everyone does.
I heard that it
was a heart attack.
It's a chest infection, Mac.
He'll be fine.
How are ticket sales?
What the hell's that
got to do with it?
Every night is sold out.
Well, add five more nights then.
Are you insane?
He coulda died.
Just let me
take care of things, Mac.
I always get him back
on his feet, don't I?
Yeah, but are you gonna be
able to get him on his feet?
Brilliant, man.
He is gonna be there.
All right, you're good to go.

For as long as I can
remember, I've hated myself.
Believed I'll never be loved.
It shows progress to take
responsibility for your actions.
Yeah, but I started acting
like a cunt in 1975.
I just forgot to stop.
Do feel ashamed.
Spent so long feeling resentful
for things that just don't matter.
Maybe I should've tried
to be more ordinary.
Hello, Nan.
You was never ordinary.
Look at you.
In here, talking about
your feelings.
What a waste of time.
Mum, I know it was never easy.
And I hope you can forgive me.
'Cause I've realized that's
what we need to do now.
Forgive each other.
- No, your problem is you're selfish.
- No.
My problem was
I believed you loved me.
And you're incapable of it.
I gave everything to
keep something that
I never even had
in the first place.
Always thought that you was
an introverted extrovert.
A what?
He's shy! He's always been shy.
It's all his father's fault.
Don't blame me.
He'd have been
strange regardless.
Actually, I think
I'm okay with "strange".
God. Not him.
Both of you.
Stop.
I'm not going to allow you to
talk to me like this anymore.
It's about time you said that.
Bernie.
I never told you
how much I need you.
No, no, no. I love you, man.
Always have, always will.
You write songs that
millions of people love.
And that's what's important.
You just need to
remember who you are.
And be okay with it.
He doesn't know who he is.
Yes, I do.
I'm Elton Hercules John.
I thought you were
Reggie Dwight?
I haven't been
Reggie Dwight for years.
When are you going to hug me?
Impressed you know
how to use one of those.
How you doing?
Some days are tougher than
others, but I feel good.
They got a piano here?
- You've been playing?
- Hmm.
- No.
- No?
Not in the right place
for that just now.
I'm scared, Bernie.
What if I'm not as good?
Without the drink and drugs?
You know that's not true.
You're not scared you're
not good without it.
You're scared to feel again.
You might be able to lie to
yourself, but you can't lie to me.
I should be going.
Don't go.
Not yet.
This is the part
you got to do on your own.
These... need music.
Thank you, Bernie.
You're my brother.
