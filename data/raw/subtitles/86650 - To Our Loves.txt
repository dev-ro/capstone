"Don't you think
one can die of love?
You told me you loved me.
What kind of a world is this?
You must despise women
who take you as you are...
who dismiss their lovers to seduce you,
another's kiss still on their lips."
You must despise women
who take you as you are,
who dismiss their lovers to seduce you,
another's kiss still on their lips.
It still needs work.
It's not quite right yet.
Want to come out on the boat?
I think maybe she should -
I only have the boat
for a day.
We're going to a great island.
Wanna come?
I'll have her back
by this evening.
We'll wait for you.
My gosh,
you must be hot in all that.
We'll be waiting.
Hurry and get dressed.
I'll have her back tonight.
Make it early,
or we're in trouble.
I see summer camps
are as strict as before.
They're getting ready to eat.
It's time.
Come on, Suzanne.
I'll bring her back.
- You have the play?
- Yes. I'll rehearse on the boat.
Have a good time.
Look at her.
My sister's pretty.
Not now, Suzanne!
You don't know your lines!
You're too confident!
Better watch out!
Why?
You're 16,
and you don't believe in love.
Do you?
Suzanne, your lines!
The water's nice.
I got a mouthful.
- You got the boat for long?
- Just for the day.
"There's No Trifling With Love."
"We played with life and death,
but our hearts are pure.
Don't let Rosette die.
I'll make it up to her.
She's young.
She'll be rich and happy.
Well, Camille, what is it?"
"She's dead.
Farewell, Perdican."
But you can't say it like that.
It's more like -
Look at that little house.
Over there?
Could we go there?
You nervous about tonight?
My God.
When I came here,
I swore to be true to you.
Why did you abandon me?
Why do you turn
even truth into lies?
I can pray no more.
That's pride.
Why come between
that girl and me?
So pale and trembling...
she might have loved me.
We were made for each other.
Who followed me here?
Who's that talking?
Is that you, Perdican?
We're mad.
We love each other.
Which of us
has betrayed the other?
Life is so cruel...
and happiness a rare pearl
in this ocean that is our world.
Like the children we are,
we made it our plaything.
But we're in love.
Yes, Perdican, we're in love.
And God, who looks down on us,
will not take offense.
He approves of my loving you.
He's known of it for 15 years.
Camille...
you're mine.
That's Rosette's voice.
Oh, God...
don't make a murderer of me.
We're foolish children,
toying with life and death.
But don't let Rosette die.
I'll find her a husband.
I'll make it up to her.
She's young.
She'll be rich and happy.
Come.
What is it?
She's dead.
Farewell, Perdican.
What are you doing?
Listen, I brought you
some grub.
And Charline's dessert.
It's a bit squashed
from carrying it all this way.
- What's Charline doing?
- She's at the port.
- What about Solange?
- They're all at the port.
It's dumb that camp rules
don't let us swim.
Imagine if they saw us.
You coming?
We're fine here, aren't we?
What's wrong?
You tired of me?
Why do you say that?
You're sweating.
It's not all that nice here, is it?
I can tell I bother you.
No, you don't.
But I'm sick of hiding too.
Can't you see?
If they catch us -
I don't see enough of you.
If there's someone else,
tell me.
Are you crazy?
You know there isn't.
It's not my fault.
I can't get out
whenever I want.
You know what the director said.
I feel awkward.
What's that?
It's beautiful.
I have to get back.
It won't stay on.
- So cut your hair.
- Just for that?
Look how short mine is.
I noticed.
You're beautiful.
More so every time I look.
And you have
beautiful eyes.
Do you speak French?
English?
My French is funny, huh?
You want... some... thing to drink?
A Coke, please.
How are you?
It's okay.
My French is bad.
You talk English a little.
Hey, it's late.
We're going.
You coming?
Bring him back to camp.
Ship?
Ship?
I don't like the military.
You're welcome.
It's free.
What's the matter?
I slept with the American.
You gonna tell Luc?
I didn't even know
what I was doing.
- You afraid he'll be sore?
- I sure am.
I'm fed up.
There he is.
- Want me to leave?
- Absolutely not.
- You gonna say hi?
- I don't dare.
He's seen me anyway.
He can come to me if he wants.
- Maybe he doesn't dare.
- He knows what he's doing.
The bastard's pretending
not to see me.
- I'd go up to him.
- No.
- That way you'd know.
- I find it disgusting.
It makes me furious.
Look at that jerk.
Come on.
It was great
when he kissed me.
I forgot what I was doing
and where I was.
I can't explain.
It all happened so fast.
When it was over, he said,
"Thanks a lot."
Know what I answered?
You're laughing,
but it's not funny.
I said,
"You're welcome. It's free."
- Did he get it?
- I think so. I hope so.
- Are you sorry?
- No, but it's rotten.
What if your father
saw me here?
I don't know.
He'd be embarrassed.
But he'd take it out
on my mother.
She doesn't say it,
but she hates me.
It's not that.
She just keeps quiet about it,
like I keep quiet about what she does.
- You mind her having a lover?
- What do I care?
She's no spring chicken.
- Sure, but -
You seen her rolls of fat?
Cut it out.
I should look like that at her age.
No, she's not bad-looking.
It's weird.
I can't think
of my parents like that.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
I can't imagine them
with their separate lives.
I mean before they met.
Brothers and sisters.
Probably sounds crazy.
My father doesn't want
to go back to Poland.
He was too unhappy there.
He's even forgotten
the language.
Where did they meet?
I think the first time they were happy
was when they got to France.
That's nice, you know?
It's sort of...
You asleep?
It's me.
What did you have this morning?
- Math, physics, English.
- That sucks.
I'm sleepy.
I stayed up all night reading.
Then climb in.
Don't start that!
Won't your mother think
it's weird?
She doesn't even know
we're classmates.
I'm sleepy.
Me too. I'm wiped out.
- This is nice.
- Hey, move over.
Don't hog the whole bed.
You're a real pain.
You take up so much room.
Your bed's huge.
That's no reason.
I want a cigarette.
You got any?
Here's the old man.
Hi, Martine.
What are you two up to?
Don't you have classes, Suzanne?
We're resting.
- Hey, Dad.
- I have no more classes.
Martine thinks your cute.
Says you have nice eyes.
Shall I join you in bed?
- There's no room.
- Quit goofing off now.
- I forgot to tell you.
- What?
I fooled around
with your brother.
No way!
With my brother?
It was nothing,
but don't tell him.
It seemed to mean a lot to him.
I had to swear not to tell.
You've got guts.
It was just a few minutes.
Okay, ten minutes
one afternoon.
But don't tell him, you hear?
Don't tell me you're busy.
I asked you yesterday
to fill in for me until 2:00.
If I can leave by 4:00,
I'll be fine.
No, I'll be back by 2:00.
I'm going to the Labor Board.
The Labor Board?
Is that astrakhan?
Make sure they match.
- They could at least undo them.
- Not like last time.
I'll help you with the sleeves.
I read the piece
you gave me yesterday. Not bad.
- You mean it?
- Yes, you got it right this time.
Creating real characters like that
in just a few lines - bravo.
I couldn't do it.
You've got talent.
Well, it was based
on some terrific characters.
I should ask for royalties.
You see?
No one can do it on their own.
It wasn't too depressing?
The question now is:
Can you keep it up
and write a longer piece?
A full story.
That's the test.
I gotta learn to concentrate.
I've seen you spend hours
on three lines. I couldn't do that.
Your mind would be on furs.
No, not furs.
Does Mom know
you'll be at the Labor Board?
Excuse me?
Your mother
always knows everything.
That's good.
I guess it's over.
- Where have you been?
- At Solange's.
I called there.
Sure you did.
Is Robert around?
- In his room.
How's it going?
Hi, creepo.
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.
See ya, Geraldine.
- Bye, Betty.
- Stay for dinner.
Maybe tomorrow.
I gotta go.
Next time, then.
You're always welcome.
You know this Bonnard?
Sensual, huh?
Well, that's Bonnard.
Aren't you staying?
No, we have to go.
Too bad.
Some kids are coming
to pick me up.
Solange and two boys.
They want me to go to the movies.
- What's all this about?
- Nothing.
- Do you know these boys?
- No.
- You go out at night now?
- No.
I invite friends over
and we go out to a movie.
It's not a date.
I want you to call it off
right now.
You think bad things
happen only at night?
I can do what I want all day,
but at 8:00 p.m. It's all over.
- That's how it is.
- That's no answer.
It's too late anyway.
I can't reach them.
She's doing nothing wrong.
You can't throw those kids out.
I won't hear of it,
you understand?
I can't tell them to leave
once they're here.
Try this once more
and I'll strangle you.
Are you crazy?
Stop treating me
like some kind of idiot!
Hit her all you want,
but not in the face!
"Not in the face"!
Who does she think she is?
Calm down.
I won't be made a fool of
in my own home!
Tell your dad you're sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- For being rude.
When was she rude?
- Night, everyone.
- Bye, Claude.
- Where's Robert?
- Now I've banged my finger.
Your home any different?
- It was the same thing.
- You the one who got knocked around?
- Yes.
- Come eat, Roger.
- Coming.
Be a sport
and lend me 50 francs.
Screw you.
It's my pocket money.
I'll pay it back.
We've got a sucker for poker.
- Did you pay the concierge back?
- Tomorrow.
Madame Betty,
I'll be at the dentist in the morning.
- You eat too.
- Who?
I cook, but no one eats.
They starve for their figures.
You got makeup on again?
I didn't say anything.
I haven't told them yet.
Hold on. I'm coming!
My mother's calling.
That's the doorbell.
- No towels here?
- Let's go in my room. My dad's -
Hi, unc.
My dear Solange.
Leading my daughter astray?
- We're just going to the movies.
- What's showing?
I don't know yet.
- You don't know what you're gonna see?
- Not yet.
You didn't think I might ask?
- We'd better be going.
- Yeah.
Your dad asked what we're seeing.
I said I didn't know.
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go.
- Don't be too late.
- Midnight at the latest.
Did you see her hair?
"Did you see her hair?"
Who gives a damn
about her hair?
Time flies...
- We've been here for an hour.
- Why didn't you come up?
- Did your dad make a scene?
- Yeah, he was a drag as usual.
- What's that look for?
- Don't start with my look.
If you don't like it -
I know: I can leave.
I just might do that.
- This way?
- No, to your place.
- We're going to the movies.
- Don't be a bastard.
How am I a bastard?
Bernard.
All my friends say
I'm an idiot to see you.
I'm not kidding.
- Really?
- I swear.
- They're jealous.
- No. They say I should drop you.
- I don't turn you on?
- Sure you do, and you know it.
Well, then?
Come on,
let's go to your place.
You'll be drafted soon
and we'll never see each other.
- As if you cared!
- I do. I'll be jealous.
No way.
- I hope you'll write.
- I don't know.
You've got some nerve.
After I drop you off at home,
I go see a hooker
and think of you.
Do you mind?
Wasn't that great?
- I'm dead.
- You're really beat?
You make me laugh.
You're really wiped out.
I've got nothing left.
When I think about it!
Ah, shit.
Want some?
- You come home at this hour?
- I said midnight.
- It's 1:00.
- No big deal.
- Who's that boy?
- Which one?
Don't take me for a fool.
What's his name?
- Bernard what?
- Bernard Trévisse.
- What's he do?
- He's been drafted.
- I mean for work.
- He works for his uncle.
He lives with his grandmother.
You gonna marry him?
Can you see me married?
Then why do you see him?
We're just dating.
Doesn't mean I have
to marry the guy, does it?
You look beat.
Aren't you going to bed?
What about you?
Your mom'll give you hell tomorrow.
Yeah, I'm going now.
I'm beat.
Good night.
What's wrong with your eye?
It's all yellow.
- Yellow?
- I swear.
You're crazy.
My eye's perfectly white.
- You've changed in the last few weeks.
- I have?
How?
- I don't know.
You don't smile anymore.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
You used to smile a lot more.
Even just a month or two ago.
You seem bored.
No, I'm not bored.
You're imagining things.
And stubborn as you are,
you're not gonna tell me why.
It's nothing, I swear.
- You changed about a month ago.
- Oh, yeah?
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
- We don't talk much.
True, but that's no reason.
It's you who's changing.
You look sad.
I'm not sad.
I'm tired.
- You work too much.
- I think I'm going to move out.
Move out?
Where will you go?
That's my business.
Have you thought
about how we'll get by?
As a matter of fact, I have.
Your brother will be
head of the family.
A brother's not enough.
A day comes when you've had enough.
Maybe that day's come for me.
You fed up with things here?
A day comes -
Yeah, you get fed up.
You've got another woman,
that's why.
That's why people leave.
- Well, yeah.
Does that bother you?
- You bet it does.
What do you care?
You're my father, after all.
So what?
I'm your father, and that's all.
Sure, but...
I can't imagine you
with another woman.
- I never said a thing, you hear?
- Fine.
I can't imagine you leaving either.
Tonight I imagined you
with Bernard Trévisse.
Oh, yeah?
You think parents
can't imagine things?
Haven't you had enough
of this Bernard?
No, or I wouldn't
go out with him.
So you're going out with him?
I mean, I wouldn't have gone
to the movies with him.
Isn't it strange how parents
and kids never discuss it?
- Discuss what?
- "It."
You've only got one now.
When did you lose the other?
- You used to have two dimples.
- I know.
- Where'd the other go?
- I don't know. It got fed up and left.
I live with you every day
and didn't even notice.
But don't worry.
You'll do fine with just one.
You'll manage.
Now get to bed.
Good night.
We had a good talk for once.
See ya.
Out for some fresh air?
Coffee?
Yes, coffee, please.
- You expecting anyone?
- Not really.
Just my luck.
I have to work.
Hi, Suzanne.
What are you reading?
Boris Vian, The Heartbreaker.
Any good?
- Sure, or I wouldn't read it.
- What's it about?
I'm too lazy to tell you.
- I'm keeping you from reading.
- No, I'm in no rush.
- You cutting class?
- No, just out for a walk.
May I join you
till my friend gets here?
If you'd like.
I was watching you.
You looked bored all alone.
No, not bored.
Just a bit down.
Don't let things get you down.
Is it your love life?
You've got a great smile.
You must hear that a lot.
Ever since I was three.
Not very original of me,
but it's true.
Dad's left us.
Time to get up.
You'll be late.
- You have to do that?
- You left the light on all night again.
You obviously don't pay the bill.
- Leave me alone.
You could put on a nightgown.
It's disgusting to sleep like that.
- Why?
- It's just not done.
Hurry up now.
You'll be late.
Hi, Richard.
What are you studying?
Math.
I have a test.
I had a strange dream last night.
I was walking
down a subway corridor.
Someone grabbed my arm
really tight.
I turned around.
It was Luc, and he said,
"Now that you've been screwed, bitch,
I'm gonna screw you too."
He pulled me towards him.
Then I woke up.
- That's remorse, my friend.
It's strange.
I hadn't dreamed about him in ages.
You working?
The café owner
has the hots for you.
Come off it!
That fat slob?
Richard, on the other hand...
I think he can't decide
between you and me.
Look who's here.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Where?
You see that?
Amazing!
We were just talking about him.
- I want to see this.
She's unbelievable.
It's like she's in heat.
Now she's after Luc.
- Surprised to see me?
- Yeah. Can't get over it.
Did you try to get
in touch with me?
I called a few times
but couldn't bring myself to speak.
- Let me kiss you.
- Stop it.
I love you.
You got nothing else
to tell me?
Did you come back
just to sleep with me?
Because you know
I've done it with others.
But I'll never do it with you,
you hear?
Never.
Because you're a bastard.
- Is that your last word?
- Yes.
- Nothing else to say to me?
- No.
- What did I ever do to you?
- You wanna know? I'll tell you.
You disgust me.
I'm going.
Are you sure you -
Luc, don't stand there like that.
Come on.
I wish I weren't like that.
I'm too aware of things.
You didn't seem so a minute ago.
- That was different.
- What was different about it?
We were doing it.
You forget everything,
you know?
You're hairy.
Don't you like that?
Sure, or I wouldn't be here.
Oh, really?
Life's not much fun
when you don't love anyone.
It's not that
I don't love anyone.
I adore my father.
But that won't get me far.
It kind of scares me.
It's as if my heart's dried up.
- You never been in love with a boy?
- Yes.
Then why aren't you with him?
It's my own fault.
I didn't know what I was doing.
You think about him a lot?
Sometimes.
But I don't want
to talk about that.
I know what you need.
A strong guy.
Someone to take you in hand.
I don't know. Maybe.
I'm sure of it.
Who knows?
It'll happen.
You're still young.
I don't know. Sometimes I think
it'll never happen again.
And another thing:
Whenever I meet a guy,
I think of my father.
So many crazy questions
pop into my head.
Would my father like him?
Would he think he was
a decent person?
Deep down,
you're the serious type.
I guess so.
What are you doing?
Go to bed.
You're crazy
working this late.
I'm going to my room.
What did she do with it?
She's such a pain in the ass!
Mom, where's the dress
Martine gave me?
Where'd you put the dress
Martine gave me?
In the trash,
where that kind of filth belongs!
Who said you could?
I'd love to belt you one!
I won't have my daughter dressing
like a whore! End of discussion!
Don't start that again, you two!
Tell her to butt out!
She had no business!
This is my home!
She's always going
through my things.
Where are Bernard's letters?
And my pictures?
- What letters?
- Now she's playing dumb.
You trying to make me mad?
I want my letters.
Give me those letters.
I tore them up long ago.
Stop it, you two!
You tore them up?
I'll belt you one! Give 'em back!
Give 'em to me!
Give me the letters.
Leave your mother alone!
Give 'em back!
You wanna kill me?
Just keep it up, bitch!
I'm sick of life, you hear me?
I'd rather be dead!
This is what I get for having kids!
You two never stop!
Look at yourselves!
Are you crazy?
Yes, I'm going crazy!
I'll drop dead one of these days!
You hear me?
Calm down.
Go to your room.
- Are you done?
- It gets worse every day.
Calm down.
- I don't deserve this.
- Come lie down.
This has to stop!
I've had it!
You're both lunatics!
Go away!
Fuck off!
I'll kill you!
Go lie down.
I'll make you some tea.
I'm not crazy.
I've had enough.
Calm down.
You want a cigarette?
It's a real soap opera
around here.
Sit down.
You say I'm the sick one,
but look who's talking.
I don't hit people.
- Did you find Dad?
- Did you clean your room?
It's fine as it is.
Is Robert home?
No, he called.
He's rehearsing late.
I see.
He's got it made.
Only comes home to sleep.
Leaves us alone here,
like a couple of dogs.
I know.
Then I'm splitting too.
I don't have to take this.
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. Far from here.
- You're gonna upset me again.
- Lay off.
- Tell me where you're going.
- I don't know.
I'll see.
- Who wants cheese?
- Aren't you hungry?
No, it's fattening.
This makes me cross-eyed.
- Want some cheese?
- Yeah.
There's plenty.
You want a plate?
We're gonna take off.
- More for the rest of us.
- You'll be hungry later.
Got any beer?
I'm gonna hit you with a roll!
It's gonna get ugly.
Watch the cork!
How about a song
for dear... Angelo?
Don't mind me.
I'm beat. And drunk.
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.
Where we going?
What are you up to?
Did I wake you up?
It's not even that late.
Come over.
No, I don't have sex on the brain.
- You snoozing?
- What are you doing?
What's up?
Just came to bug you.
- Can't I get some sleep?
- You mind?
I'm kind of beat.
Martine doesn't like sleepyheads.
- I couldn't sleep last night.
- How come?
Guess...
with all that racket next door.
Well, well.
Now we're even.
You've got Suzanne,
while I call the other guy.
Lemme have a cigarette.
Seems it's true love.
You're lucky.
He's lame.
- How am I lame?
- You are.
How am I different
from other guys?
- You know.
- Take this.
Actually, I wonder
which of us is more lame.
You leaving?
- You two work it out.
- There's nothing to work out.
I'm going back to my man.
At least one guy got lucky.
Want me to take you home?
I don't feel like going home.
- How many days since you went home?
- I don't know anymore.
It is too my business.
Settle down.
You think about him a lot, huh?
Yeah, sometimes.
That's all in the past.
I did a lot
of stupid things with him.
I didn't realize.
- What was his name?
- Luc.
- Was he good-Looking?
- I'll say.
And that's not even my style.
But yeah, he was good-Looking.
You scared me.
You scum!
You'll pay for this!
Here we go.
It's show time.
What about your little show?
Look what you do
to your mother!
We've had it with you!
Apologize!
- I'm miserable here!
- She's trying to kill me!
We're sick
of you being miserable!
Get on your knees
and apologize!
It's your fault!
I hate your guts!
I'm gonna kill myself,
but I'll kill you first!
My daughter's a monster.
Yeah, I am!
What of it?
You shouldn't have
fucking had me!
I'll make you eat those words!
Shut up, you fucker!
You're worse than her!
- I gave you everything.
- You'll eat those words!
I paid a fortune
for your analyst.
Screw my analyst!
I don't need help!
I even repainted the apartment
so you'd stay with me.
Because I love you!
Why don't you love me?
She doesn't love me!
Go to your room!
From now on you'll deal with me!
You shouldn't have had me!
It's rotten to have kids anyway!
I indulged her every whim
so she'd be happy here.
I'm going.
I'll be back around 6:00.
Where you going?
I'm meeting your aunt
to tidy up the grave.
Have fun.
A lot of good it does Grandpa!
I didn't ask you to come.
I wouldn't go anyway.
Except the day they bury you.
You ought to get
your hair done.
To please whom?
Your kids, at least.
And yourself.
Go straighten up your room.
I want to talk to you.
I've decided
to go away to school.
I can't live this way.
We hurt each other too much.
I can't stand her.
It's better if I go.
Don't you think?
Think you can take
boarding school?
It's tough.
I'll come home weekends.
It'll go by quickly.
I'll see her weekends.
Maybe we can put up with each other.
It'll be easier
on you guys too.
Think it over carefully.
I have.
My mind's made up.
There's really no other choice.
High school was all messed up
anyway. I'd stopped going.
I cut class.
Sometimes I feel
like killing myself, you know?
Sometimes
I'm sick of living.
Why do you say that?
I'm gonna go.
I forgot to tell you.
You don't try to understand me.
You never have.
Can't you see I'm unhappy?
I'm only happy
when I'm with a guy.
Don't ask me to understand that.
It's impossible.
I know.
That's all I had to say.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were
away at school.
I come home weekends.
Paris is much more fun.
Wait a minute.
What's that pain in the ass
doing here?
Don't be mean, Luc.
She bugs me! She doesn't have
to follow me around!
I'll be seeing you.
- Go charge this on me.
- Awesome.
You like it?
Don't look so grim.
Kiss me.
You sore at me?
No. Why should I be?
He was free.
You really love him?
It's the first time.
You still up?
So you got screwed, huh, bitch!
You asshole!
Mom!
Who reamed you
this time, bitch?
Well, it wasn't your ass!
You jealous?
You're gonna be sorry!
Asshole!
You're just a faggot!
- I'll show you!
Shit! It's because of
your goddamn mother!
Let her go!
Go to your room!
Get out, bitch!
- She thinks she's so hot!
- Out of my sight!
Go to your room!
I don't want to see your face!
Filthy slut!
Asshole!
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
I don't want you
to ever leave me.
Because I went out without you?
Don't leave me.
Jean-Pierre.
You know
I won't leave you.
I don't want you
crying like that.
Not with me.
It's too hard on you.
Want to walk a bit?
Come on.
Want to go home now?
So you wanted to talk to me?
You're the one with some talking to do.
Suzanne says you beat her.
We usually receive
her friends in the front hallway.
This isn't funny.
You want to see her bruises?
Either you don't give a damn about her,
so you ignore her,
or you do care -
the more normal reaction-
in which case
you should have tried to meet me.
No offense, but if I met every guy
she's dated, I'd be a busy man.
She didn't tell you
we were serious?
You're not the first. I don't mean
to hurt you, but my sister's fickle.
She has a heart like a wheel.
For the moment, it's you.
You're cute.
In a few months
it'll be someone else.
I'm sure that's not true.
Suzanne must have told you.
I'd like to see her settle down
and let us be,
let me focus
on my career a bit.
I don't think you understand.
You know...
I'm in a rather
difficult position.
I'm not alone.
There's my mother too.
For her, all that counts
is marriage,
and that the bride
be a virgin.
So what do you suggest?
I love my sister very much,
but I'll always protect
my mother.
- What'll we do?
- We'll look for one that way.
You gonna try them all?
We'll find a place.
I'm fed up.
You're really a pain.
You could rent a cheap room.
We've spent hours at this.
It's a drag!
You're really bad-tempered.
Cut it out!
All this drives me nuts!
- Let's try this one.
- I'll wait here. You gonna try them all?
- You coming?
- No, I'll wait here. I've had it.
You coming?
It's okay?
Don't look so grim.
It'd be prettier with the collar.
- It's for you.
- Who is it?
I didn't ask.
Luc, how did you know
I was here?
That could be difficult.
Okay.
At the café in an hour.
All right.
- Who was it?
- A friend.
It's my bridal wreath.
I hope it brings you luck.
Like a little angel,
not like her real self at all.
Be a dear and make some coffee.
You know where it is.
Don't you think you've had
enough coffee?
You were so sweet
as a little girl.
When you were out alone,
your father was terrified
you'd be kidnapped.
He adored you.
I don't understand
why he left.
I do... and I don't.
But he still loves us.
You think I like
seeing your brother beat you?
Stop it.
He thinks he's helping, but he's not,
taking your father's place.
It used to make me sick
when your father was hard on you.
Maybe you were his favorite.
Let me talk.
You and your brother
may not love me,
but your father did and still does.
I'm his youth.
Quit brooding over all that.
Think of yourself.
It's too late.
I've always worried about others.
Did you cut your hair?
I love you, Suzanne.
I never stopped loving you.
You know about Anne?
It doesn't matter.
She was just a rebound.
That's not what I mean.
She couldn't take
breaking up with you.
She took off for England
with a guy last week.
I'm getting married in a week.
- You don't love me anymore?
I almost called it off
a month ago.
I love you.
There's nothing I can do.
We can start over.
It's not too late.
Impossible.
I don't want to hurt him.
I don't want
to always be hurting people.
He can't love you like I do.
Now more than ever.
Anyway, I've changed.
I'm not the same girl.
I couldn't make you happy.
- But I could make you happy.
I don't know
if I can be happy anymore.
The only time I was happy
was in the Alps, remember?
I was so happy
I thought I was dreaming.
That's why I wanted
to die with you on the toboggan.
I knew that after that -
No, it can't be.
Maybe I won't be
truly happy with him,
but it's the first peace
I've known since we broke up.
That's important.
It's not enough.
I'll make you 15 again.
I'm not 15 anymore.
I can't believe it.
Dreaming again?
I've never seen
anything like it.
There you are, joking with everyone,
then pow - you're gone.
My head hurts.
That's no excuse.
It's the champagne.
No, it's not.
It's my eyesight. It's very poor.
- Then get some glasses.
- Glasses!
You've met Jean-Pierre?
- How long have you been married?
- Six months.
Would you have a job for him?
He worries me.
You're a pain in the ass.
This young man
doesn't need me.
- What a modest neckline!
- Hands off!
- So you used to beat your sister.
- I never beat my sister.
I wanted to bite her
because her skin was so nice.
She smells so good.
She smells good!
Do you get jealous over your sister?
Robert does.
Yes, there's still
some primitive bond
between brother and sister.
Am I interrupting?
I hear you now say
Robert's an asshole.
Michel's changed.
He envies my success.
I'm just getting started.
I'll show them all.
Pretentious man.
I'll say.
Fanny, what are you doing in there?
Come here.
My wife! You took my talent.
Don't take my wife too.
- She loves vulgar men.
- I love only one man.
You're lucky.
You ignoring me?
I love it.
Twenty years of work.
- My wife's beautiful.
- Very.
What about your mother?
Hello, handsome.
Scratching one's head
is so sensual.
One's feet too.
I trained my sister well.
She smells like
the lost virginity of youth.
She smells good.
My leftist intellectual
brother-in-law.
You should smell my sister.
Yes, a very pleasant smell.
So how was Munich?
Too heavy and slow.
Too rich, too fat,
too provincial.
Did you see
the Picasso exhibit?
I ran through, like the Louvre in that
Godard movie, Band of Outsiders.
I didn't think it was so bad.
His early stuff wasn't bad.
You don't like Picasso?
Not much.
He's overrated.
The whole myth of the great
boy draftsman. He was no Ingres.
- They weren't the same age.
- What do you mean?
In Barcelona
Picasso was only nine or 10.
And I don't like the way
he backed Apollinaire
against the Douanier Rousseau.
Of the two, Rousseau was
clearly the better painter.
It's not that simple.
That's not how it happened.
- Were you there?
- I read about it. Everyone knows.
And they're off.
- Ah, you read about it.
- You surprised?
No. Anyway,
the myth of the old man
still young at 90,
dying in his prime,
with his daubs
piling up at Vallauris.
His daubs?
Were you at Vallauris?
Yes, I bought some pottery
for my mother. Horrible!
By "Picasshole"!
This guy's too much!
You like Picasso?
I do. I've seen
every Picasso exhibit.
Her favorite painter is -
Bonnard.
He's sensual.
You love sensuality, don't you?
I like things
that last just a moment.
That's why I like sensuality.
I like what's momentary,
so things like paintings,
works of art -
I don't like the past.
It's boring.
I like things of the moment.
When he says "moment,"
it sounds like "mommy."
Where's Mommy?
- What do you do?
- I'm a colorist.
- What's a colorist do?
- He colors.
Really, what's your line?
I correct reproductions
of paintings.
Reproductions.
Not even originals.
You have to be good
with your hands.
It's artistic, not manual labor.
He's a manual laborer.
Exactly.
A manual laborer.
- How about a brandy?
- More to drink?
I have a beautiful daughter, eh?
I don't like him touching her.
Quit pawing her.
His hands are dirty.
Don't touch my sister.
Don't. It bothers me.
Cut it out.
You see how close he is
to his sister?
I think it's nice.
Not like us at all.
They had a completely
different upbringing.
I can barely stand.
Are you out to make it
with Michel?
Poor Jean-Pierre.
What about Jean-Pierre's buddy?
Romain, with the big feet.
Did you make it with him too?
What are you saying?
Leave her alone.
You didn't change the locks.
Good. That way
I won't need a locksmith.
May I go in?
This is the dining room.
Sorry. I didn't expect
this distinguished gathering.
You've got 60 feet here.
This opens up all the way.
Sorry,
but the lease is up soon.
We won't be long.
Just ignore us.
This is the workshop.
These doors open.
You can put your machines here.
You've got all of this.
About 50 feet.
We didn't use the attic much.
Lots of room.
This is still your home.
Have some respect.
Right, and the lease is up,
so I'm showing the place.
You're right. It's my home.
I'll have a bite.
Some pudding.
May I eat in peace?
I know you.
In two seconds, you'll be going -
Well, not this time.
I apologize.
I didn't know
I'd be interrupting a party.
I thought I'd find
the place empty.
You're not interrupting.
Ah, you must be
the brother-in-law.
The lady's brother.
I get the feeling my son married you
as much as your sister.
Ask him.
I see nothing wrong in that.
Always on your high horse,
hobnobbing with people like that.
You who were going
to be a furrier?
Now you're giving me lessons,
glaring at me like that?
I'm just an ignorant man,
but sometimes -
I wasn't prying,
but he'd leave magazines around,
and I read yours.
You write extremely well,
by the way.
You even gave a special issue
to that thing he did on La Scala.
Two months later
you let them publish...
something quite
unflattering about you,
dragging you through the mud,
but in seemingly objective interviews.
One guy rated you
3 out of 20,
called you a real wretch.
He could have replied.
Or you could have replied for him.
Oh, it's none of my business.
If you came
to make trouble, beat it.
Telling the truth is always -
You used to be full of life.
Now you're just pompous.
And you're a money-grubber.
Or soon will be.
Money isn't always dirty.
But when you've always
believed certain things,
and you suddenly discover
all this, a gulf opens.
You wonder
why you even lived.
I read once -
maybe it's not true, I wasn't there -
but when Van Gogh died -
- Oh, stop!
- I want to discuss Van Gogh.
When he died,
he supposedly said -
and if he didn't say it,
he could have.
He said,
"There'll always be sadness."
It struck me,
because I thought,
like everyone else,
that Van Gogh
was a sad figure.
But I think he meant other people
are the sad ones, don't you think?
You're the sad ones.
Everything you do is sad.
It's sad having a wife
whose brother insults you
or lets you be slandered
in his rag.
You'd do anything
to get where you've gotten.
Happy now?
Take wing, fly.
I thought he could be
a modern-day Pagnol,
but how far has he gotten?
You know as well as I.
I think he's talented,
and you should -
Yes, he has
quite a unique talent.
He wrote dialogue
that brought characters to life.
I thought,
"My son's the next Pagnol."
You think being in our company
destroys his talent?
He's your brother-in-law.
The power of money.
Right, Miss Suzanne?
Are you like them?
Who's right? Them or me?
Where do you stand?
She doesn't have to choose.
Why not?
Where do you stand?
- Right here.
- She's on my side.
When she visits me,
I ask nothing of her.
Whose side is she on then?
You never told me
you visit him.
You're here one day -
I'm on no one's side.
I mean, I'm on my side.
Suzanne really loves you.
- Suzanne loves everyone.
- I don't agree.
She'd love me dead,
more than anything.
You always want
the people you love to die.
A girl doesn't think that way
about her father.
Anyway.
They all wish I'd die.
I'd become a living god.
With me dead -
Stop it, damn it!
Get in the kitchen.
We were fine
until you barged in.
Stop it!
Get out!
I know you carry on like this here,
but don't start on me.
I've seen enough of you.
To hell with your lease!
Go ahead.
Defend your mother - who hit me.
I hear you practice
on your sister.
Then look after her.
It's high time you did.
Like you do:
With daily beatings.
You never even call
to see how we are.
You swine,
get the fuck out of here!
How'd I put up
with that vulgarity for 20 years?
That's right - 20 years.
Drop dead!
You want to see me get mad?
Get out!
- Stop yelling.
- I'm not. I just said get out!
Sit down and I'll leave.
Here, sweetie.
Now scram!
I said sit down.
We can't keep up
this routine forever.
You sit down -
- And you get lost.
Mom packs a punch!
That was intense.
Life's weird, huh?
You look up to your father.
Then he moves out
and comes back a different man.
Perhaps our being here
upset him.
Maybe we shouldn't
have stayed.
I think he's gone mad.
You don't come visit me often.
Things okay?
- Yeah.
Where are you off to
with your little suitcase?
- I'm leaving.
- It still doesn't lock.
I hope you're not going far.
It's hot today.
What's up?
You moving out too?
For the weekend?
- No, I'm going to San Diego.
San Diego?
Really? For long?
Three months, six months -
I'm not sure yet.
Couldn't you have
told me sooner?
Yeah, but I haven't seen you.
When I was a kid,
going to Trouville was a big deal.
You only saw the sea
once a year.
Now you're off to the Pacific.
Adrien said that in winter
you see schools of whales
right off the coast.
That must be great.
They say San Diego's great too.
The biggest US naval base.
Lots of sailors,
and you love uniforms.
Who you going with?
- Michel.
The guy with the big nose?
Why did you get married?
And what about Jean-Pierre?
You'll never really love anyone.
When you were tiny, you were so cute
I thought you'd get kidnapped.
It was foolish of me
to think that.
You think you're in love,
but you just want to be loved.
- Everyone's like that.
- Certainly not.
Some people are capable of loving.
- Not many.
Well, you're not among
the select few.
Anyway...
you should stay there.
It'll do you good.
I'll visit you now and then.
I'm not washed up yet.
You gonna forget about us,
Miss Suzanne?
No, I won't forget you.
- Off to honeymoon with someone else.
- Why don't you do the same?
Oh, yeah?
Give me a kiss.
This is the first time
you didn't push me away.
No, the second.
Remember?
Stay over there.
When your mom and I were young,
we wanted to move to Canada,
but we never did.
- I might not have been born.
- Maybe not.
Look at this suitcase.
You gonna carry it?
If you want to check it in,
you'll have to tie it up.
I'll keep it with me.
Well, good-bye.
This is as far as I go.
Run along now.
