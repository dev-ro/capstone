Welcome
to the future of robotics.
Let them help you.
{\an8}Chores around the house?
{\an8}There isn't anything
they can't do.
{\an8}The next marvelous advancement
in robotics
is artificial intelligence.
By studying the human brain,
we have given
independent thought
{\an8}and life to robots,
{\an8}allowing them to join
the American workforce
almost like real people.
Now, a new technology
is bridging the gap
between humans and A.I.,
making us closer than ever.
By scanning
your own facial features,
we can give them
to a fully robotic body,
making them
more human than human.
{\an8}With a simulant, the future's
never looked better.
A.I. is integrated
into all parts
of our day-to-day life.
They cook our meals,
they drive our cars,
they are our civil servants,
keeping the peace,
and with the new
state-of-the-art
defense system, they even...
Ten years ago today,
a nuclear warhead
was detonated in Los Angeles.
Nearly a million people
incinerated,
in the blink of an eye
by the artificial intelligence
created to protect us.
We banned A.I.
in the Western World,
so this will never happen again.
Yet the republics of New Asia
do not share our concern,
and continue to develop A.I...
embracing them as equals.
Now, make no mistake.
We're not at war
with the people of New Asia.
But the A.I. they harbor...
This is a fight
for our very existence.
For as long as A.I. is a threat,
we will never stop hunting them.
Nomad. This is Bravo, inbound.
LT is bearing four, one,
three, niner...
Roger that, feet wet.
Team leader's radar has you...
Company moving in.
This is Nomad. Copy that.
Sending the strike coordinates.
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Baby girl.
Well, they're
either gonna be really smart,
- or take after their dad.
- Whoo!
- She mad at you.
- That was...
That was a kick of agreement.
- That was a kick of agreement?
- Yes...
- That was... Yeah.
- She's like "Nah,"
"nah, don't call Daddy that."
"Don't say that to Daddy."
Wait. I mean, you are
a hundred percent sure
I'm the dad, right?
No.
- Try to understand.
- Oh, wow.
When it's born,
if it starts acting like
a complete dick,
you can feel pretty confident.
- Oh, man!
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- No, that is... You know what?
- I'm kidding.
I'm good. I think I'm leaving.
- No, no, I don't want...
- I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
- No, I just... I feel hurt.
- I'm kidding.
- Now I feel insecure...
- Shush.
And I don't know
if I can carry on this...
In other words
I love you
What's going on?
We found an American.
Who told you our location?
- Harun.
- Oh, please.
Brother, they found us.
We weren't careful enough.
Shit, Nomad's
coming this way. Let's go.
Let's go!
Get the boats. Hurry!
Americans are coming.
American...
Go, go, go!
To the boats.
- Joshua.
- Oh, please.
Maya, he's seen us.
We can take him
with us. A hostage.
- Please.
- Get your things.
Please. Don't do it.
Please.
Drew, what the hell
are you doing here?
You're gonna blow my cover.
You were gonna
give me more time.
Orders. Kill Nirmata.
Nirmata's not here.
You hear me?
Nirmata's not here
Engaging the enemy.
Into the house. Now!
- Move!
- Go, go, go!
This is Sergeant Taylor.
Call off the raid, damn it!
Nirmata's not here.
Moving in on Nirmata!
- Near the guest room.
- Listen,
I'm undercover.
You gotta call off the raid.
Told me you were out.
You promised.
Trust me, they don't want you.
They just want Nirmata.
So let's go.
Let's go. Come on.
Maya.
Easy.
I love you.
I would never do
anything to hurt you.
Hell...
you're all I have.
Please. We have to go.
What about the others?
What do you mean?
- They're my family.
- They're not people, Maya.
They're not real!
This is real!
You and I are real.
This love is real.
That child is real!
No.
This...
this isn't real.
Maya, you don't
mean that. Please.
- Sergeant Taylor!
- Maya, please!
- No!
- Hey, let's go!
Come on.
Hey, let's go!
Maya! Maya.
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Nomad! Nomad! Maya! Maya!
No! No!
Maya!
{\an8}No.
Off. Off.
Thought
to be hiding in the isles
of Southeast New Asia,
the ongoing manhunt continues
for the mysterious A.I. designer
known as Nirmata.
As US forces widen their
search across New Asia,
- Nirmata has evaded capture...
- I'm doing great.
Rest, a little recreation,
you know,
eat, sleep, go to work, repeat.
And the headaches?
The nightmares?
Gone.
What about your memory?
Anything coming back
from when you were undercover?
Like Nirmata's location.
Uh, nothing new.
Just the night
of the extraction.
Special Forces raid.
Nomad missile strike.
Your source dying.
Wife.
We were married. This...
Me and my source. But...
No. I got nothing.
How's your job?
We thank you for your service
in cleaning up Los Angeles.
{\an8}Radiation levels
are at an all-time low
{\an8}thanks to
the unwavering dedication
{\an8}and hard work of our team.
Oh, shit.
All right.
Oh, I saw this video...
that said the reason
A.I. nuked us
was to take our jobs.
They can have this job.
Hey, you gettin' anything?
Hmm? No.
How about now?
- Nothing yet.
- Hey, foreman,
grid six.
You gettin' a readin' on this?
- No!
- Shit! Oh, my God!
Where is the child I was with?
- Where is she?
- Will you help me?
- Child! Where is she?
- Get it off me! Get it off me!
She needs my assistance!
- Foreman!
- -Her name is Amy!
- We got a 11-4-4.
- Is she okay?
- Yeah...
- Child!
- Hey!
- Amy!
Amy! No, no, no! Please,
- please, please don't. Don't.
- Wait, no.
Amy!
- Foreman, you got that?
- Yeah.
Copy that, Taylor.
He's offline now.
That was like
a real person, okay?
- Hey, calm down, Harrison.
- That was like a real...
- Harrison, Harrison.
- That was like a real person!
- Harrison!
- Dude, what the hell?
That was real!
They're not real, okay?
They don't feel shit.
Just programming.
Prepare level two
for thermal processing.
Seven-five,
begin recycling process.
{\an8}Fifteen years
since the nuclear explosion
{\an8}in Los Angeles
{\an8}launched the West
into a war to eradicate A.I.
{\an8}The trillion-dollar
military station, Nomad,
{\an8}is finally helping
the West win the war.
{\an8}Becoming a permanent fixture
over the battlefields
{\an8}of New Asia, where A.I.
is making its last stand.
Acknowledging the pain,
and sorrow
- that has taken place.
- Hello!
- Hello!
- Children who have lost
- everything...
- Hey!
I remember this.
Hello! Hey! Hello!
Looks like you've
seen some trouble.
How'd you get these?
L.A. nuke.
You lost people?
Yeah, I lost my parents.
My mom and dad, my brother.
Sorry.
They were at Ground Zero.
It was instantaneous.
So, it's all good.
Okay. Squeeze my hand.
Can let go now.
What, my hand? Okay.
And a one. And a...
No, it's stuck.
But let's try another angle.
If I try another angle...
Sergeant Taylor...
I'm General Andrews.
This is Colonel Howell.
No.
No what, son?
Whatever it is you want.
People come here every week.
Ask me if I remember.
I don't. I don't remember.
You're gonna wanna
see this, Sergeant.
We've located Nirmata's lab.
It's in the area
where you were undercover.
Our intelligence tells us
that Nirmata's developed
a super weapon
called Alpha-O.
It's designed to destroy Nomad.
Well, I'm sorry
for your loss, I guess.
You know,
Neanderthal's got a bad rap.
I mean, people talk
about them like
they were dumb, but...
you know,
turns out they made tools.
They made clothes.
They made medicine
out of plants.
They even made art.
Little flower necklaces
to bury their dead in.
The only problem was
there was a species
that was smarter
and meaner than them.
Us.
And we raped and murdered them
out of existence.
You get where
I'm going here, Taylor?
It took nearly a decade
to build Nomad,
so this our last chance
at winning the war.
If they get this
Alpha-O weapon online
and destroy Nomad, they win.
And we go extinct.
You're the only one who knows
the layout of that lab.
Maybe you can help us.
Did they tell you how close
I was to finding Nirmata?
How close I was
to killing the son of a bitch?
How you assholes screwed
the whole mission
with Nomad's missile strike?
- Sergeant...
- 'Cause that much I remember.
I lost my wife that night,
General, all due respect.
I lost someone
very near and dear to me.
I lost a child that night.
So, I don't give a shit
about becoming extinct.
I got TV to watch.
Hey.
Hey, guys.
We're not far from the beach,
so we should just stop here.
- Deal me in.
- Maya?
This can't be real.
This was recorded two days ago.
Authentication tests confirm
she's human.
Do you recognize this location?
Sergeant Taylor...
- Joshua.
- Come on. Let's...
My orders
are to destroy that weapon
and the facility,
and whoever's there
is going to be killed,
but if you can remember
enough to come with us,
guide my team, I promise you,
we will bring that woman back.
Come on, let's...
Oh, come on.
Move out at 0600.
All right, settle down.
Welcome back to New Asia.
We've got
a location on the lab...
which, as you can see,
is way behind enemy lines.
Our nearest base,
400 miles away.
They don't care about LA here.
The human locals,
including the police,
all work with A.I.
Robots, humans, and simulants,
they all hate us.
So, you get caught,
you're screwed.
Don't get caught.
Sergeant Taylor knows
the layout of the facility.
We work off him.
Our mission is to find
the weapon designated Alpha-O.
Then we call in a missile strike
from Nomad and blow it up.
Yeah.
Dismissed.
Hey, I got dibs.
That's pretty ballin', man!
As long as I kill it after.
- That's your wife?
- Mmm-hmm.
I'd do anything
for just one more minute.
It's fine. It's fine.
I know, I got you.
I lost...
I lost both my sons in this war.
This is the real...
This is the cream of the...
What makes
it harder is they joined up
because of me.
One of them fell
for a simulant in Hua Hin.
- You believe that?
- Daniels!
A barmaid at a juke joint
near the base.
She told him she loved him.
He goes to buy out
her contract and it turns out
she set him up. Yep.
Yeah, sure...
She and her insurgent buddies
took their sweet time
killin' him.
Yeah, this...
this is a hold section.
Anyway, I hope
you find your wife.
Echo one to Nomad.
Releasing the bird.
Kid A, Kid A
Kid A, Kid A
Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place...
Go, go, go!
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's move! Move! Move!
Go, go, go!
- Down!
- Down.
Take us up.
Oh, man!
- What is that?
- The hell we goin'?
It's not a lab,
it's a damn shanty town.
Used to be down there.
- Damn it.
- Looks like they built
a village on top of it.
Well, shit.
Whoa!
Where's the lab?
Where you hiding
your robot buddies?
Who's gonna talk?
Where's the entrance?
Why are you protecting A.I.?
Okay. It's okay.
You're ashamed to be human?
I'm gonna show you
what's gonna happen.
See this nice little pup here?
Hey.
- You know...
- No. No.
Is this yours?
Hey, where's
the entrance? Talk!
We are just farmers.
Cut the bullshit, huh?
Three.
You understand that?
Talk to me.
Two.
One.
You know what one, two, three,
means? Where's the entrance?
Tell me where
the entrance is! Talk to me.
- What are you hiding?
- Talk to me.
Shut your little crying mouth.
- Give me an answer. Tell me.
- Look at me!
Captain!
Captain!
McBride, Hardwick,
you stay here.
Everybody else, you're with me.
McBride: Wasn't so hard,
was it?
- We're in.
- Copy that.
We'll circle back
in figures, 3-0.
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
Stay far, maintain comms.
Copy that, Cotton.
Those things down below...
they have bigger hearts.
You can't beat A.I.
It is evolution.
Which hatch is it, Taylor?
This dude gets me killed,
I'm gonna be pissed.
Come on, Taylor.
Which one?
That one.
I got it.
Sir, we located the weapon.
Let's move, move, move!
Oh, shit. Come on.
Maya.
Get to the door,
get to the door!
Damn it!
Shipley, we gotta
get this door open.
Damn. Local cops coming
to shut the party down.
Open the goddamn door!
Please make love to yourself.
And also make love
to your mother.
They got this place
sealed up tight.
It's the only way.
Commander,
is there any other way,
any other route to the vault?
That's a negative, Captain.
Most of these locks,
they work
through facial recognition.
Guess I just need
a face then, huh?
This is the police.
You are under arrest.
Put down your weapons...
Guys, I just fried the J.V.
You better move your asses.
Whatever's in there,
they're sure worried
about someone getting in.
Yeah, or it getting out.
All right, there's got
to be a way in here.
Everybody spread out,
look around, let's find it.
Over here.
It's a key pad.
Guys, we've got company.
Don't tell...
Oh, yeah.
We're in business.
Okay.
Uh, um...
Hey, guys...
I need backup. Now.
All right. Shipley, Taylor,
get this vault open,
and find that weapon.
Daniels,
set the targeting beacons.
Everybody else, you're on me.
Let's move, move, move.
Hey, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Shipley, I need help now, man.
- Shipley, Shipley?
- Daniels?
Help, right now.
- Daniels?
- Oh, God!
- Fuck.
- -Shit.
Goin' after Daniels...
I'll be back here
before this thing opens.
Do not go in there without me.
Copy.
Maya?
Go! You must leave...
Go find Nirmata!
Go.
Find Nirmata.
Go!
Give me a status on the weapon.
Shipley and the new guy
went for it,
but it's all gone to shit!
God damn it!
Nomad's about to fire.
Nomad, delay the strike.
We can't turn off the beacon.
Daniels!
Daniels, come in.
Shit!
If I'm not back in three mikes,
take off without me.
Maya?
Maya? Maya?
This is Nomad to ground team.
Evacuate immediately.
Missiles will impact
in one minute.
Get this bird
in the air, right now!
Bradbury,
we can't make it to you.
You've got to come to us.
I know, I know.
Right now.
Move, move! Come on!
I can make it.
Bradbury! Let's go!
Come on, come on, let's go.
- Come on.
- God damn it.
You can make it.
Come on. Come on.
Let's go!
Come on. Get up!
Come on!
Come on, let's go!
- Get in here!
- Go, go, go!
- You good?
- Yeah.
Nomad is about to fire
any second.
What's that?
- What is that? What?
- Bomb!
- Bomb, bomb, bomb.
- It's on me?
Get it off!
- I'm trying!
- Somebody get it off.
Get it off! Get it off!
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Go.
Go. Get the hell out of here.
Get the hell out of here!
Get out my face!
Weirdo.
Bravo one, four, five...
Copy, do we have an ETA
on air support?
Copy, ETA is 10 Nirmata.
This is Echo Two on the ground.
Implement nav op forward
niner, three, five,
four for extraction.
Hello!
Hello!
Can anyone...
Oh, God. Oh, God,
where are the others? Oh, God!
Shit.
All right, here we go.
One, two, three.
Okay. Calm down. All right?
- You're okay, you're okay.
- Stop.
Shipley, you're all right.
All right.
Shipley, look at me.
- You're not dead.
- We will be.
You're not dead.
The hell you come from?
Ship, stay with me.
Police everywhere,
so we gotta get moving.
Gather your strength.
Shipley, it's Howell.
Answer the goddamn phone!
Shipley, I know you're there.
- Pick...
- Colonel?
Taylor, where's Shipley?
I'm with him right now.
He's in pretty bad shape.
All right, listen to me.
Did you locate the weapon?
Yeah, it's here. I'm with it.
Describe it.
It's a kid.
It's a kid. They're making it
into some kinda kid.
That's the weapon.
What?
- Colonel? Look, I...
- I can't reach you.
You have to bring it to me.
Do you understand?
No. Shipley can't move.
I mean, he's...
He's not looking good. At all.
Police are everywhere.
I don't know how
I'm getting out right now.
I don't even have
an exit strategy right now.
Then you know
what you have to do.
- Kill it.
- What?
Look, Colonel, I...
Colonel? Hello?
Howell?
Howell?
Howell?
Tough day at the office?
Where'd you see that?
Hey, hey. Hey.
Easy.
Okay. Hey.
All right.
It's a miracle.
They've made a child.
Don't worry,
I will kill the American.
It's... It doesn't die,
it's off.
I just turned it off
like the TV.
Same thing.
It's not dead, it's off.
Where'd you see this?
Where did you see this?
Hey...
- Whoa!
- -Hey, look, look.
Have you seen her?
Can you understand me?
Do you know who this is?
She's friends with Nirmata.
Do you know where she is?
Give me that. Give me...
Give me that. That's fine.
Dian Dang.
Dian Dang.
Give me that. Give me...
Okay, okay.
Little Sim,
how do you get to Dian Dang?
Where is it?
Police.
Oh, shit.
One, two, three...
Come on.
Come on,
Little Sim, get in the car.
Hey, it'll be fun.
Like cartoons.
It will be, be fun.
Okay. It's like a game.
Hide and seek.
I'll drive fast.
All right,
let's go. It will be fun.
Ha! Right? Come on.
This is hell a fun, this is...
Why don't you wanna get
in the car? It's a lot of fun.
Get in the damn car.
Shit.
Whoa!
Seat belts.
What is this?
It goes on your head.
There's a switch around back.
McBride: Come here!
Missed my turn.
Death is not to be feared.
The mind moves on.
The message is a song
She shall be called Woman,
for she is taken out of man.
Once I had a dream
To sing...
All right, Little Sim.
Where's Dian Dang?
Where's my wife?
Son of a...
Drive.
Back...
back to base.
I can't do that.
The next American base
is 400 miles away.
- I'm dying, man.
- We'll never make it
- past the checkpoints.
- I'm not gonna make it.
You know we'll
never get past 'em.
Give me a chance, man.
I'm trying to, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.
All right? I got a friend
in the provincial capital.
He's gonna help us. Okay?
Okay.
Who the hell is she, huh?
What the hell is she?
Shit.
Off.
So, you speak English now?
Shit.
If they ask, pretend that
you're human, all right?
Pretend like you're
a real person. Okay?
All right, what do they
call you? What's your name?
What's your name, Little Sim?
What'd they call you?
What do you like?
- Candy.
- Hell no. Pick something else.
- But I like candy.
- Well, Candy's occupied.
We got a full residency
in Las Vegas, all right?
So, you pick
something else you like.
Alpha, omega. I'm gonna
call you, Alphie, all right?
That's your new name.
Your new name's Alphie,
you understand?
- What's your name?
- None of your damn business.
Act real or off.
You understand?
Hello?
You need help?
Yes.
The truck broke down.
Can we get a lift to the city?
We'd really appreciate it.
Okay, slow down.
Slow, slow, slow.
Get him out of here quickly.
We don't have a lot of time.
Roger that.
Over here.
Now bring me
one of the simulants.
Copy.
Oh, shit. It's faint.
He's been dead for hours.
We'll be lucky
to get 30 seconds.
How do you know that works?
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Hey. Shipley?
- What the hell?
- Shipley?
- What the hell?
Shipley, where's the weapon?
- 20 seconds.
- Shipley.
Oh, God, am I...
I wanna talk to my wife.
Shipley, you're already dead.
I'm sorry, son. Truly.
But there is no time.
The whole war
is in the balance.
Was the weapon terminated?
- Shipley?
- My wife.
Shipley?
Taylor has it.
Taylor has it.
10 seconds.
He says he has a friend.
- Who lives there.
- Where?
- Shipley?
- My wife.
Tell her, I...
That's it.
I'll see you in Valhalla.
Howell?
Mount up.
We got a traitor to kill.
Simulant child abducted
by an American fugitive.
Proceed with caution.
You have six children in your van.
This says you only have five.
I'm sorry I forgot.
My brother's kid
is also traveling with us.
Take your hat off.
Take your hat off.
Alphie, go! Now!
Drive! Go!
Anyone have fun?
Checkpoint guard saw

Wanna play a game?
It's called,
"Save your friend Joshua"
"from getting killed
by the friggin' police."
All right?
It's easy to win.
You could win easy.
All you gotta do
is point to the map.
Just point to where my wife is,
please, and you win.
Yay! We all win.
You're my friend?
Hey, hey, hey,
little bot! Pay attention.
My name is not "bot".
My name is Alphie.
Remember?
Fine.
I don't like this game.
You know what?
How about I call my friend
in Leelat city, all right?
I'll call him right now.
I could tell him
to get his crowbar ready,
pry it open.
Get the information that way.
You want that?
Then fine. Let's go.
Bus number 464.
Final destination, Leelat city.
If you're not a robot,
how were you made?
My parents made me.
Where are they now?
Off.
They're up in heaven.
What's heaven?
It's a peaceful place
in the sky.
Maya? Maya?
Are you going to heaven?
No.
Why not?
You gotta be a good person
to go to heaven.
Then...
We're the same.
We can't go to heaven.
Because you're not good.
And I'm not a person.
Oh, God. Oh, no. Please.
She's keeping some
pretty nasty company, man.
Intelligence believes
her father might be Nirmata.
I need you to follow her.
Gain her trust.
See if she can lead you to him.
Here, I got you something.
Thought you'd never ask, man.
I'm way out of your league.
- It's for her, asshole.
- All right.
Long range tracker.
I need you to get it on her,
so we can kill Nirmata.
And what about her?
What about her?
She's a terrorist, Josh.
Do not go native on me, pal.
I found the child.
She's with the American.
Hey.
Josh.
You ain't here
to kill me, are ya?
Mr. All-American.
I see your loyalties
have changed.
God, man.
It is good to see you.
What? Who's this?
Whoa. So, they're
making kids now?
Drew, this is Alphie.
Simulant.
Alphie, this is Drew.
The asshole.
Hello, Asshole.
Ooh.
Very good.
She got these crazy abilities.
She can remotely control things,
turn them on and off.
I didn't even know
they can do that shit.
Yeah. I've never seen
tech like this.
Wild.
So. I'm gonna get you
something from the kitchen.
What do you want, sweetie?
For robots to be free.
Oh, we don't have that
in the fridge.
How about ice cream?
Great. Ice cream then.
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.
"Babe"?
- Here we go.
- Did you say, "babe," Drew?
Yeah, don't start with me.
She, says she...
It says, it knows
where Nirmata is.
Maya will be with him.
Can you get it out of her?
She's touch encrypted.
If you ain't Nirmata,
you ain't gettin' in.
What about the ring you gave?
What ring?
You know, the ring.
The ring I gave Maya.
You still got
the tracker for it?
- Josh, she's gone, man.
- No, I saw footage of...
- Stop, man.
- I saw the ring.
I saw her,
- she was wearing it.
- Okay.
- She looked very alive.
- Okay. Okay.
All right, man, I'm sorry.
Holy shit.
What?
Come here, man.
Josh, that's the most
advanced sim
I've ever seen in my life.
The others
are just copy and paste.
But this kid's different, man.
She can grow.
You said she can control things.
The range
of her powers will grow too.
Eventually,
she'll be able to control
all technology remotely.
From anywhere.
She'll be unstoppable.
There's no more ice cream.
Hey, babe,
can you do me a favor,
and take Alphie upstairs
to the apartment?
- We'll be right up.
- Sure.
I love babysitting.
Come on, sweetie.
Did anybody see you come here?
Ice cream.
Mocha, chocolate.
Mocha, vanilla.
Ah, I found the tracker.
Just hope
she's still wearing that ring.
I saw fake Mayas.
I've seen them too, man.
It doesn't mean anything.
She probably just donated
her likeness at some point.
You know they were
doing all that,
"Get scanned today,
support A.I.,"
all that shit.
Tell me about Joshua, Alphie.
He's funny.
We play a game called...
"Save your friend Joshua"
"from being killed
by the fucking police."
- What's the matter?
- They're coming to get me.
Who's this?
Ice cream delivery.
Oh. Ice cream.
Simulant child is located
on the 28th floor
of the apartment building.
- McBride: Here we go.
- Suit up.
- Bye-bye.
- Please leave a good review.
False alarm.
Ice cream is here.
Tell me your favorite.
Which one do you want?
Oh, fuck.
You are safe from the American.
Come with me.
We'll protect you from him.
All right.
Drew, we gotta go. Drew.
Go, go, go, go!
Check the rear.
Hack everything.
It's time to call in
the cavalry.
Needs his mountains
Like a seagull
Needs its painted wings
Love I need you
Come go with me
Tracker's saying
the ring's nearby.
It's your old house
on the beach, Josh.
This is crazy, Josh.
There's no way she's out here.
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?
Listen, the night of the attack,
there were things
you didn't know about, okay?
Things you don't
wanna know about.
You weren't privy to.
They came over the wire
right before we came in.
Josh, you don't understand.
Don't do this. Please.
Damn it!
My friends are coming.
Oh, shit.
Josh!
Josh!
Josh. We gotta go!
Get back to the truck. Josh!
Josh!
Hey! Hey! No, no, no!
Time to move.
Get the boats. Hurry!
Drew,
what the hell are you doing?
Do you hear me?
Orders. Kill Nirmata.
Family, Maya.
- What about the others?
- Maya.
They're not people, Maya.
They're A.I.
They are not real!
This is real!
You and I are real.
This love is real!
That child is real!
Tell me where Maya is.
You know where she is.
Okay, just tell me where she is,
I'll leave you
alone forever, okay?
Tell me where she is!
Whatever you want,
just tell me she's alive.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey. Okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Josh! Josh.
We gotta go!
Drew.
- Josh.
- Drew.
Shit.
Shit.
It's okay. It's okay, Drew.
I'm here. I'm here.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
I wanted to tell you.
They wouldn't let me.
The night we attacked,
we learned...
that Nirmata...
It wasn't her father.
It was her.
It's her.
Maya.
Maya's Nirmata.
Maya.
No. Wait, wait. Drew.
Wait! Wait! Drew.
Drew!
Drew!
Come on.
We have to go.
Back up.
Brother?
Come here, my child.
Alphie.
Alphie.
I met her at, uh...
I forgot what
the club was called.
I mean, she was beautiful.
My father taught me
everything he knew about A.I.
When the war started,
he was forced to flee.
I was raised by the simulants.
They adopted me.
You know, 'cause they can't
have kids of their own.
They protected me.
Loved me, took better care of me
than humans would've.
Maya.
Nirmata.
If I could just hold you...
one last time.
What do you want with the child?
What is she to you?
She was taking me to Maya.
After her father died,
Maya became the next Nirmata.
Maya made the child
with the power
to stop all weapons.
The nuclear bomb in Los Angeles
a coding error. You know that?
Human error.
They blamed us
for their mistake.
We would never attack mankind.
Do you know what will happen
to the West
when we win this war?
Nothing.
We only want to live in peace.
Harun.
Let me see her one last time.
Please.
That's what they want, you fool.
They are following you
to get to her.
I will never take you
to Nirmata.
Harun!
Harun, we need you.
Get them on the comms now.
Hello, hello.
And keep us in position.
What's happening?
They're attacking our base.
Hey, hey. Alphie.
You okay?
They said you're
going to hurt Mother.
It's not true.
I would never hurt Mother.
I love her.
Does she love you?
She did.
She did once.
When she made me?
Help me.
Help me find... Mother.
Where is the child?
Harun...
We should go.
Get the child to safety.
Nomad!
Nomad.
Nomad.
Sir, casualties from the NOMAD attack!
We can't hide
from Nomad anymore.
The child will save us.
She can stop it?
She is not ready yet.
The range of her powers
are still growing.
But, if we can get her up there,
maybe she can destroy it.
How could anyone survive that?
She won't.
But it will turn
the tide of the war.
Does she even know
what she's been created for?
No. She is innocent.
They created us to be slaves.
But we will be
delivered from slavery.
Soon. Our savior is coming
with the power to end all wars.
We will finally be free,
and our two species
will live together in peace.
Shit.
Standby. Not off.
Let's go find Mother.
Let's take a drive
Down Lover's Lane again
Retrace our tracks
down Lover's Lane again
Relive the past...
Oh!
Shit! We're under attack.
Come on. Come on.
It's me! It's me!
Americans, Commander.
They've come for the child.
Where is she?
Oh, shit!
Find her.
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey...
Harun.
Oh, shit.
Have you found her?
What happened?
Report back!
Come in!
Harun?
She is not here.
But there is movement
on the tree line.
Americans are near.
What is it?
I can't see.
Stay down.
Get them
out of here. Go!
Go!
- Move! Go, go, go! Go, go.
- Hey!
They've come for me.
I have to help.
There's nothing we can do.
- I have to help.
- Alphie, we gotta go.
Alphie!
Alphie!
On the bridge.
Targets. Targets.
Targets. Run! Run!
Arm the bombs.
G-13, you're up.
Detonation, 100 meter radius.
Set in three, two, one.
Go.
Go!
Command confirmed.
Goodbye, ma'am.
It's been a pleasure
to serve you.
Launch! Launch!
No, no, no.
G-14, launch.
G-14, ready. Go.
Command confirmed.
Go!
- G-14, come in.
- What's the problem?
Gone radio silent.
- G-14 stalled.
- Oh, shit.
Targets at our six.
Go get me the child.
Copy that.
Alphie! No!
Taylor, get down.
Don't do it.
Alphie?
Countdown reactivated.
Alphie! Come on.
Hey.
We have to help her.
Take her to Nirmata.
Daw!
Get in!
Go, before it's too late!
Let's move.
Let's move!
Where is my child?
We've escaped them sister, you're safe.
We'll fix your eyes.
But first we need to find Harun.
The Americans are following him.
We need to warn him.
Where's he headed?
He's going downriver with the child.
Headed to Than Ton Temple.
To see the Nirmata.
Thank you.
Mount up.
There will never be
another like her.
Her mother completed her
in secret,
when you were together.
Just weeks before
the night of the attack.
She could have made her
to hate mankind.
Perhaps she should have.
But Maya put her love
for you into the child.
She made a new kind of life.
From a scan of a human embryo.
A copy of your child.
Like it or not, Joshua,
you are part of us now.
My father taught me that
underneath it all,
we're the same.
I was in an A.I. village
where they cared
for human orphans.
Nomad attacked.
There was a little girl
bleeding to death.
And when her mother
saw that she'd died,
she turned herself off.
She couldn't outlive her child.
This war needs to end.
Hey.
Let me take her to Maya?
We will take the child.
Yeah. Careful, careful.
You wait here.
She loved me.
We were gonna be a family.
Oh, yeah, 'cause you know
all things, right?
Mm-hmm.
All right, what's
the name of our kid then?
We both had our secrets, but...
We were gonna raise a child.
And I am her and she is me.
We're all connected.
Joshua, come.
She is ready for you.
Is this Dian Dang?
Alphie told me
she's in Dian Dang.
Dian Dang means "heaven".
How long has she been like this?
Five years.
Since the night of the attack,
when she lost her human child.
Harun brought her here.
We hoped she would awaken...
but...
she is stranded.
She cannot return.
She cannot depart.
Death would bring her rebirth.
Then why haven't you?
It is impossible.
We simulants
cannot harm Nirmata.
Please help her.
Help her get to Dian Dang.
Oh, Jesus.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
If you can hear me.
I was wrong.
Can you forgive me, please?
I promise I will make it right.
I wish I could be
with you again.
Goodbye, Mother.
I love you.
NOMAD has found us!
EVACUATE!
Your orders
are to hack everything
and find their remaining bases.
Take her down.
Come on, we gotta go.
We got...
Colonel?
First the weapon,
then the Nirmata.
Thank you for your service.
Well, you're too late.
She's gone.
Not until I say so.
You playing God now?
You know,
you're lucky. I have orders
to take you and that thing back.
Stand down, Sergeant.
Back off.
Let her rest, Colonel.
I told you she's dead, okay?
You are a selfish
son of a bitch, Taylor.
I ought to put
a hole in you right now.
But you hand that thing over
and nobody has to know.
You can go home a hero.
You lied about Maya bein' alive.
- You'd never let her go back.
- That's right.
- Going in.
- Put it down.
- Put the gun down.
- Drop the weapon.
Now!
Put it down.
Don't.
No.
- Shit! Wait, what is that?
- Shit!
Get it off.
Come on! Get it off!
- God! Get it off!
- Yeah.
- Get the thing off me.
- Hold on.
Come on.
Weapons hot!
No, wait, wait, wait!
Get her out of here.
Destroy Nomad,
brother.
Come on. Come on.
No, wait. Wait, no!
Freeze.
- Friendly.
- Hey!
Sergeant Taylor...
Nomad's about to fire.
We gotta go.
You're a hero, sir.
You did it!
You killed Nirmata.
You got the weapon.
We found the other bases.
Let's go! Let's go!
Hold! Hold!
It's okay.
Hey, hey, give her back.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Stop! Wait, wait.
- Joshua!
- Joshua!
- Stop.
Sergeant, move.
Move, move, move!
- Joshua! Josh...
- Alphie!
- Alphie.
- Joshua!
Joshua! Joshua!
Hey, it's not real.
It's just programming.
It's not real.
It's just programming.
Alphie.
Nomad Messenger.
Seven. Nine. Zero.
We tried to terminate
the weapon cleanly,
but she won't let us.
She trusts you.
So, either you help us
or our other methods
will be unimaginably painful.
This is quick.
It's better this way.
Those tech boys will...
Am I going to heaven?
Listen to me...
What'd he say?
What's happening?
It's just interference.
The EMP device is charging.
Sir, it worked.
The weapon is neutralized.
What will they do with her?
Normally, it would be
taken up to Nomad for research.
But instead,
it'll be incinerated
at the Ground Zero facility.
I'd like to be there
for that. Please?
It's not a funeral.
It is to me, General.
{\an8}Anti-Nomad
protesters are gathering
{\an8}throughout the world,
condemning today's
planned strike on A.I. bases.
What is it?
Sir, we've decoded
what Taylor said to the weapon.
Patching it through.
Not off. Standby.
Shit. Stop that vehicle.
Pull over! Now!
That's an order!
- Stop the truck.
- Alphie, do it. Do it.
Oh, my God.
What the hell?
- Joshua.
- Come on, Alphie.
Tell forward units
to cut off that angle!
Secure!
- Move!
- Let's go. Go, go.
Containment,
get eyes on the other side!
Where's the weapon?
Where's the weapon?
Clear.
Surround the vehicle. Box 'em in!
Where did they go?
Next stop,
Los Angeles Spaceport.
Flight OX-1

is now boarding.
Please proceed to gate 35 C.
Thanks for flying Lunar Airways.

Shit.
What is the purpose
of your travel?
To be free.
Enjoy your flight.
Sir, they're trying
to board a Lunar shuttle.
Shoot to kill. Let's go.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Please stay calm
and follow all instructions.
Emergency space suits

- Okay.
And keep your seat belts

- Hey, Alphie, you ready?
As we prepare for descent
back to Los Angeles...
One and three are down.
- You got nav?
- Negative.
What's going on?
Sir, we've lost contact
with Flight OX-1.
It changed course.
Do not let that thing
get aboard Nomad.
Sir.
- What happened?
- Ladies and gentlemen,
due to an emergency,
we have been
- forced to land...
- What?
At a military installation.
We ask you to evacuate calmly
and obey all military personnel.
They are here to protect you.
It's okay, everyone.
Please stay calm. Follow us.
No sign of 'em.
We're goin' in.

He's gonna blow the door!
- Move back, move back!

Alphie! Alphie, hang on!
Hold on, hold on!
I can't, I can't!
No!
Open the airlock!
Hit the button!
Hit the button,
please. Hit the button.
Sir, Taylor's
arming an explosive.
They're gonna take out Nomad.
Bring forward the attack.
Launch on all A.I. bases.
Shit. They're
launching the missiles.
Alphie. All right.
All right, listen. Here.
I'll be with you on the radio.
You've got to stop them
from launching the missiles.
You go turn the power off,
so I could blow this place up.
Mother...
this is what she wanted.
Do it for her.
Do it for Mother.
Go to the control room
and shut down the power.
I'll meet you back here.
Go. Go.
It's gone inside.
The weapon's inside Nomad.
Seal it off and destroy it.
- Yes, sir.
- Wait.
Where's Taylor?
Okay. Don't fall, Joshua.
Don't fall.
- Move, move, move.
- Take the shot.
Cover me.
