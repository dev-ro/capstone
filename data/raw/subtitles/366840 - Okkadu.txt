That's mine.
Leave them!
Hey! There's no way this side.
- We are stuck.
Cowards! Don't worry about them.
What's happening here?
This area has become
troublesome area.
We're discussing "together"
how to control it.
Is it the way to discuss?
Who beat you? Is it he?
No problem, tell me.
Is it him?
Come on, tell me. - No, sir.
That is...
He slipped and fell down. - Where?
Sir, that is...
Here!
Who fell down? Was it you or him?
- He only.
Where? - Here only.
Where? - Am I not saying him only?
I fell down here only.
Youngsters!
Playing games & little skirmishes
are quite common.
If you cross your limits.
I'll forget that I was once
a youngster like you.
Forget it sir!
Shut up!
Today, we are going away.
Let's decide it in the game of
Kabaddi tomorrow.
What can they do in a Kabaddi match?
By the way, match is scheduled
tomorrow, isn't it?
I think, it's better to start
practicing in the ground.
Writing exams again?
I've to write again in September.
Stop looking at me and
look into your books.
You'll definitely pass.
Look into your books.
Do you've any sense?
If I did, would I've been
born as your brother?
Can't you ever walk into
the house properly?
This's my room, my will & wish.
Why're you dancing with a
group of monkeys?
Are you calling us as monkeys?
We'll...
Oh God! Will you scratch me?
I'm just a human.
Asha, will you take care of
your brother or shall we?
What will you do?
We'll pluck out your eye balls.
We'll bite you.
Will you take out lice
from my hairs also?
Get lost!
What's all this dolls here?
What's going on here?
Is it your room or mine?
This is not your room.
This is my room.
Dad has told me to use it.
What will you use it?
You're so young! Do you want a
separate room for yourself?
As night falls, you'll go next
to mother. Go out... go out!
We are not little girls!
Look, how big we are...
Oh, Asha, I had brought
something for you.
What's it, brother?
Take it... take it...
Stop! We had stopped eating it,
when we were young.
If you want lick it yourself.
Come, let's dance.
That means, you'll not go out.
That's all, isn't it?
I'll be very free in my room.
Very free!
Looks like, he'll get down
to his birthday suit.
Wait!
Mother, look, what brother is
doing there?
Did you see, how he made my friends
to leave this place?
I was hearing everything.
Can't you help me by
cutting onions?
Oh God, lt'll give tears.
I'll not cut it.
If you don't practice now,
You'll shed tears in your
In-law's place in future.
Did you see how he's talking
to me, mother?
Are you accepting now that
you're a little girl?
Lick this Lollipop!
Oh mother! Why do you do
all this work?
I'm your son as well as
your daughter.
Give it to me, I'll cut it
for you. Give me.
Learn it from him.
So, I'll be the remaining balance
for you finally.
Mother, balance made me
to remember...
What's your Bank balance?
Rs.73,000! - If you take out
Rs.4000 from it?
Rs.69,000!
Did you see?
My mother is a great mathematician.
You're great in apple polishing.
So, mother! You're now going
to give me Rs.4000.
When did I say that?
You had only said if you take 4000
from 73,000, it'll be 69,000.
Why do you want Rs.4000?
I thought of giving you
Rs.500 from it.
You said it just now, mother.
Mother!
Would you please put
your autograph here?
Oh, have you brought the
cheque also?
Keep an account of the expenses.
- I'm buying a ledger also.
Shall we now continue with
preparations of crisps?
Mother, you move away,
I'll prepare it.
Come... come... come quickly.
Lollipop... hot... crisps are...
Hot crisps! Would you like to try?
Stop!
How many times do I've to warn you
not to get into trouble?
Who involved in it unnecessarily?
Do you know about the operations
of that Soda gang?
We are here for that!
Who are you to take Law into
your hands? Tell me!
If you still can't hold yourself,
Pass IPS first and then
show your poweres.
Jobs can't be secured only
by studying well.
It can be secured in
sports quota also.
Atleast, are you sincere in that?
You're spending most of the time
in street brawls.
Are you showing any interest
to go to the ground?
You go on scold him like this only.
Someday, he'll become a great man.
- When?
When will that day come?
Old millennium gave way
to the new millennium.
Home made crisps are excellent.
Is it really that good?
Do you've to praise so much?
I'll praise any job done good.
Your mother prepared it nicely,
so I complimented her.
I had prepared it.
If you don't get any job...
Are you thinking of making a
living out of this?
Superb idea, daddy.
Go and study.
I pity you, mother. - Why?
We went to the bank day
before yesterday.
You went, so what?
Laughing and cracking jokes.
With whom?
Who else, mother.
Who's that girl? - Which girl?
Where?
Will you give me the crisps?
Don't act too smart?
What happened in the bank?
We withdrew cash.
- Oh! Is it the cashier?
How much did you give?
I withdrew the cash.
Have crisps, father.
You can eat later.
First, tell me about her.
I've a match tomorrow.
I've to practice for that.
You dress up & go out
to do this stuff?
It's not that? - Then, what?
I must know who she's by today.
- Listen to me, Vasundhara.

Ajay, this is a wonderful
opportunity for you.
All higher officials of my
department are coming there.
They're in the recruitment
board too.
You must play well & turn their
attention towards you.
She wanted you to become
my senior officer.
You must make her dream come true.
Have it.
Take this money.
So, you didn't withdraw
cash for me.
Did you go to bank again?
When you come inside,
I'll teach you a lesson.
You go.
There're snacks in this box. Eat.
I don't want any snacks.
I don't know how to
spend this Rs.100.
I brought it from Lakshmi's
(Goddess of money) place.
Why do you compel him?
Give it to me.
You keep quiet.
This is for him.
Take a look.
These snacks?
Why didn't you tell me?
I like this very much.
It's time to leave. Bye.
Hey, where's my suitcase?
It's in safe hands.
- I'm here to lift it for you.
Have all our boys got down?
Let's go.
Where's Kumar?
- Perhaps, he won't come back.
He has trapped a girl
during the journey.
There he comes.
What happened? Okay?
Ajay, superb chick.
- Has she fallen into your trap?
Here's her address.
Keep watching.
- He's lucky.
Boy, this is Kurnool.
Be careful.
Let's go boys. - It's mine.
He's here.
Didn't I tell you,
this is Kurnool.
This is very common here.
Let's go...
What's it?
Twist... twist.
Good.
Feeling shy?
The exams are nearing.
I don't know how am I going
to prepare? - Yes.
Swapna...
Swapna, let's go home.
- What happened?
Quick. Let's go.
Has something happened
to my father?
Obul Reddy has killed
your brother.
Don't cry. Have some water.
Have you informed Suresh?
- I did.
He respects him very much.
They studied together
till 10th std.
Everything must be performed
as per our customs.
Has the washerman come? - Yes, he has.
- Make it fast?
Hey, your brother has come.
Get up... get up.
You wanted your brother and
sister to study well.
There he is.
Look at him.
Your engineer brother has come.
Get up.
Get up.
Look at your brother...
He should've lit my pyre.
But the fate has made me
to lit his pyre.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Hit me, I say.
This is knwon as
Martial Art "Varmakala".
If I hit you on your nerves.
You must scream like hell.
You bloody bugger!
Hi! Nephew.
Why're your eyes so red
like chillie?
Did you cry on your
brothers' death?
Or are you angry with me?
I can understand your sorrows.
Get buttermilk for my nephew.
Add a hint of lime.
It'll cool his body.
What did I do?
I didn't ask for palaces.
I invited him.
He spat on my face in public.
Am I a piglet?
I'm son of Rayalaseema pride.
I chased him & killed him.
Come and have butter milk.
Mother, let's go this way.
What's this?
It's in the size of a Onion.
It must be bigger size that can
blast even Allagadda to pieces.
Hey, should she have to teach
you everything?
Make big bombs.
Mother, let's go.
Greetings, madam.
Greetings, madam.
Bulli, come on... move.
Hey, make it fast.
All of you get in.
Greetings.
Greetings... Please sit down.
Hey, come here.
This is for your, elder brother-in-law.
This is for your, younger brother-in-law.
Forgive me.
Uncle, where's Swapna?
Sit down... sit down.
I killed 20 people by planting
a bomb in a car.
When I knew that our enemies
were travelling by bus.
I burnt the bus.
Land deal problems, property problems.
Problems at the time of elections,
There're about 30-40 cases
filed on me.
But, no witnesses for any crime.
Who can dare to testify against me?
You should've heard about
my manliness.
If I wish, I had neither left a widow
nor a new born baby's mother.
I've touched almost all women,
whom I like in this area.
But, had I ever touched you?
I didn't.
Do you know, why?
I was waiting for you to mature.
You come into my dreams.
You make me cry & laugh.
You're my queen.
You're the queen of my house & fort.
If anyone tries to stop our marriage.
He'll die.
Hey kid, she is a little girl.
She's feeling shy.
I'm an elderly person, I'm here.
I'll talk to them.
Look, Dasaratharama Reddy.
We must come out from our sorrows.
Can you get back your
sons by crying?
My son says he loves your daughter.
He wants to marry her.
Since we belong to the same caste,
I agreed.
Your son told my son is 15 yrs. Older
and marriage can't be performed.
Can he put such a question
to my son?
Isn't there 15 years age difference
between me & my husband?
Didn't we have children or
didn't I give birth to them?
Look, it's said that, in the house
where a death has occurred,
An auspicious function
should be performed.
If marriage is conducted,
My son will be both son &
son-in-law to this house.
We'll fix the alliance.
If you've any relatives,
invite them.
Come on, my son.
Bye.
I'll marry Obul Reddy, father.
Don't stop me.
Let me do this atleast now.
If I had done this earlier,
My brothers would've been alive.
We've lost our 2 sons.
Are you telling us this
as good news?
Father, you've not accepted
many things in life.
My elder brother wanted to study.
Didn't you stop his studies
for the sake of us?
Didn't my mother quit the job to
stay close to her children?
You did these things against
your liking.
What's wrong in marrying,
though I don't like it?
To get rid of fear & sorrows.
There's no way other
than this, father.
Instead of that it's better we die.
- Mother.
I can't hand you over
to that scoundrel.
If you want us to be happy,
do as I say.
I withdrew this money from
my P. F for your marriage.
I've also got your certificates.
Take them & go for away from us.
But, where father?
Look...
Look, how many letters your uncle had
written from America for you?
He has written that you're
studying well and...
You're the cleverest of all and
he wanted us to send you there.
Since, I didn't like to
send you so far away.
I had hidden these letters
from you in the bureau.
Go... go to your uncle's place.
Let's live with a hope that you're
atleast alive. - Father.
How can I leave you...
I've taken this decision
after a deep thought.
There's no other way go.
Every morning, Sun enters into
every one's life.
But that scoundrel will
enter our lives.
Go... go... - No. Father.
Don't say a word.
If everything goes well,
we'll come there.
Go... go... go...
What're you doing there?
- Unload the goods.
Swapna, stop. Is anyone here?
What's this?
Why're you running away like this?
What'll happen to me?
I dreamt that we got married & your
brothers are reborn as our sons.
Come... Why've you hung down
your heads?
Do you feel shy to
look into my eyes?
Then, look into my heart.
It's true.
Hereafter, don't cry. Come.
Come.
Come...
Thank you.
Mother, brother is on
line from Kurnool.
Will you talk to our mother?
There is not much time left.
The match will start in few minutes.
Inform mother that I'll leave by
evening, okay? - Okay... Okay.
I'm buying lollipops for you.
I won't forget.
He has hit Obul Reddy at Konda Reddy
bridge in broad day light.
Who's he?
He's definitely not from Kurnool.
They're here. His henchman are
here, they'll.
Start...
Where do you want to go?
Don't know.
They're coming.
Hey, search in the bushes.
Search in the farm.
- Make ripples in the water.
They're over there.
Catch them.
Search them here...
Don't risk your life for me.
Go away.
They're demons.
They'll kill you.
I'll consider it as my fate.
Go away.
It's not manliness to run before
the war is over.
I came to your place
to play Kabaddi.
But now, I've come to know that.
I should play here and
not on the ground.
Who're you?
It's wrong... it's wrong.
You rob 1 crore from me.
I can earn it again.
Take 10 kg gold.
I'll buy it again.
How can you take my heart?
Hey, She's my heart... Life... Wife
...My darling.
I love...
If Swapna...
If Swapna is lightning,
I'm the thunder.
If Swapna is festival design,
I'm the flower on it.
Like an ox stamping the flower.
Will you dare to stamp my heart?
How dare you hit me at Konda Reddy Burge
centre in Kurnool?
I won't kill you normally.
I'll shred you to pieces & consecrate
our love with your blood.
Cut any part of his body
which you want.
Go back... go back.
I don't know whether the life of the
black magician is in the parrot or not.
I know that your life is in her.
As your life is important to you,
my life is more important to me.
No... no...
I can't bear if Swapna gets hurt.
Ask anything you want.
I'll give you.
But... no... no...
Hey, come here.
Come.
Come here... - He has come.
Remove your dhoti. Remove it.
Hey remove it... he has removed it...
Leave her. He has removed it.
- Spread it.
Throw all your sickles over here.
Throw them all.
Throw them all...
They've thrown them all.
Pack them...
I've packed them.
Leave her... Blood... Leave her.
Hey, You come here... come here.
Come here, he has come.
Throw this into that Gypsy.
Except that, deflate all
other vehicles.
Go, take away. Go... & deflate
all vehicles, deflate.
They've thrown the sickles.
They've deflated all vehicles.
Leave her... leave her.
You go & sit in the Gypsy.
Take the knife... Take it...
Get in.
Where else should I phone up?
He's neither in relatives' house
nor in friends' house.
It's okay. Get down.
I told him that if he wins
this match.
His life will change.
Did he listen to us?
He didn't go to the match at all.
Where's your son? We thought of
honouring his talent...
We thought of giving him
a chance to...
That's my father.
It's about me.
Oh God! Since he was going
to play kabaddi.
I gave him money for
pocket expenses.
That's my mother. She is very good.
Wash your face.
You've made him fit for nothing
by giving money.
If we are lenient, he'll complaint
about others.
You believe whatever he says
and support him.
Do you know what he had told
to that girl in the bank?
It seems he said "my father is
unable to forget you"
She called me up &
expressed her grief.
She said "sorry sir,
I can't cheat my husband"
Not just one headache...
For him to win the match.
I even went to temple
& prayed for him.
Look Vasundhara, don't stop me today.
Yes daddy. Don't spare him today.
He has become a big headache for me.
No one will react so silly in
one's career related matter.
She's my sister.
Very dangerous.
Let me see what excuse, he'll give.
Let him give any excuse.
I'll not forgive him.
Is anything more important
than his career?
Let him come.
He's finished today.
Do you want it?
I'll go & show my face to them.
You be here itself.
Beat me... Beat me...
If any one comes back from a
tournament without playing.
Any father will get angry,
not only you.
Beat me, father!
Beat me black & blue.
You didn't beat me, when I threw
away my S.S.L. C marks list.
You didn't beat me when I faked fever &
didn't attend intermediate exams.
Before mother asks if you had done it
earlier, would he have become like this.
Beat me, father. Beat me!
Stop this overacting.
Why are you hurt?
Giving up the match. Did you unnecessarily
get involved in some trouble?
No! I had practiced
little too much.
Practicing for a never playing match.
It's not time to joke, Asha.
Really, fathers have great expectations
from their sons.
Father who never visits temple
would've prayed for me.
How's that? You're repeating
father's words perfectly.
Only a son can understand
a father's heart.
How can a daughter understand it?
They grow up under him for 18 years.
After that they'll marry and
go to their In-law's place.
That's what you do, don't you?
Why're you getting angry on me
after not playing a match?
Am I a fool to come back without
playing the match?
I knew after reaching Kurnool that
this will decide my Nationals fate
But I told you to tell this to father,
when I wished you on your birthday.
Didn't you tell him?
When did you tell me?
You might have forgotten in your
birthday party.
Okay, let bygones be bygones.
Father, this time I'll definitely
win National Cup.
I promise on Asha.
I don't have faith in you.
Don't promise on me.
I promise on you. - No son!
You promised to get state rank in
10th class on Grandma.
Poor Grandma!
That is... Grandma was little hasty.
I promise on you father.
Mother, father, I'm dying in hunger.
Oh mother, serve me food.
What happened to my puris?
Which Puri?
Amrish Puri or Om Puri?
Eating Puris!
You might've eaten it.
No, you might've eaten it.
Look at my plate.
My Puris are here only.
What might have happened
to my Puris?
You're cheating me.
Mother look, brother has
taken away my Puris.
Why do you want to eat Puri?
Eat rice!
What happened to my Puris?
Thieves have stolen it.
Why're you behaving like a child?
Just now, you eat it, father.
Mother, serve him curd rice.
I'm finished with my meals.
Take Puris... It'll taste good.
My mother is a good cook.
Drink water. - Not me.
Who's that?
Who's that? - It's me, father.
Shall I bring water?
I'll come myself.
Take water!
Drink!
I'll go inside & drink.
Why am I hearing 2 hiccups?
I hurt my vocal cords in practice!
If anyone practices too much,
He's likely to hurt his spinal cord.
How could you hurt your vocal cord?
Yes, isn't it?
That's father...
Laddu strangled my neck.
Swapna, no need to worry anymore.
I'll make all arrangements for you
to go to America.
I'll apply for your Passport or
Visa tomorrow.
As your parents had wished,
You can go to your Uncle in America
and study well.
Okay?
Don't worry anymore, sleep well.
Hey, you big boy!
Have you come here to attend
a function?
Instead of beheading the man
who had hit your brother,
And throw his head at your
brother's feet.
What's the use of you being
a Home Minister?
You've 10 cars, Police & Security
following you. Yuck!
Who dared to hit my brother?
I don't know.
Where'll he be?
Don't know!
Shit!
Do you know in which
direction he went?
Towards Hyderabad.
I'll make Police search from Ramoji film
city to Ranga Reddy Dist. Border.
I'll bring her & conduct
your marriage.
That's manliness.
Now, you've proved that
you're my son.
Son, consider that you're
married to her.
First, his death.
Then, my marriage.
Hey! You've stamped
on the tail of a snake.
That Obul Reddy is
no ordinary man.
Obul Reddy means?
By any chance, he isn't Siva Reddy's
brother, is he?
Siva Reddy? Who's he?
Your father's boss,
the Home Minister.
The entire state is
under his thumbs.
It's impossible to
escape from him.
Anyway, you've sent away
that girl, haven't you?
If you're careful for few days,
that's enough.
How am I to send her?
Don't you want a passport
& Visa for it?
That means... That girl is still...
where is she?
I've hidden her in the
wardrobe of my room.
In your home?
You're father is a
strict disciplinarian.
It's like you're hanging between
the devil and the deep sea.
How could you hide
her in your house?
I thought! It's the safest
place for the present.
It's very difficult to send her
to foreign in present situation.
Getting passport & Visa
isn't so easy.
Getting passport easily
isn't difficult for us.
Instruct us what is to
be done at which time.
Though, we had lost
the Kurnool match.
...We must win this game.
Yes.
You had put entire
Hyderabad to shame.
Yuck.
How could you come back
here shamelessly?
Who're you to sneer at us?
You carry on.
You should've shown your
prowess on the ground.
These boys are back streets heroes,
they're zeros on the ground.
Why do you want to enter
National Level Competitions?
Why can't you be just street dogs?
Don't jeer at us like girls,
if you've guts, let's decide it.
Come...
Why're you stopping me?
They're making fun of us.
Not now.
What happened to you?
Are you yourself?
Am I not saying, not now?
Should we keep quiet then?
You all are not just unfit to play,
even to fight also.
May be they had got
castrated in Kurnool.
They're sneering & jeering at us &
we're taking all like eunuchs.
More than losing the game, their words
are making me furious.
Don't you know about my not temper.
Till that girl leaves Indian
shores for America,
At any cost we mustn't turn
attraction towards us.
Save all this temper and use it
when the occasion arises.
Great Acid Batch!
Don't ever cross swords
with Soda batch again.
What happened to them, buddy?
They never used to tolerate
even a word of fun.
Do you think something really
had happened in Kurnool?
Something must've happened
in Kurnool.
I've alerted all city
border check posts.
I've put on traffic police
also on duty.
He can't escape from our trap.
We've handed over the case to the
best officers in the Department.
What are you all doing?
Is your Police Department sleeping?
Or is it working?
He's sleeping & accusing
the department.
Check every lane and
bylane of Hyderabad.
I'm not able to beat
to see to my brother,
Someone has eloped with my brother's
future wife. - Not eloped, but kidnapped.
Kidnap... Kidnap.
I don't know how you'll do it.
In 24 hours, find the girl &
finish him off.
Take it, change to this dress.
What happened to the
girl's passport?
I don't want to hear all that crap
manage it yourself.
Mother.
I'll call you later.
I had kept my dress on
the bed here, where's it?
What dress?
I had kept it here only.
Why do I find you always
in my room?
Can't you use the bathroom
of mother's bedroom?
It was yellow dress.
I had kept it here only.
You're stressing on yellow dress.
Did you promise anyone that
you'll come in that dress?
Hey, you keep quiet.
This's my wardrobe. How many times do
I've to tell you not to touch it?
Okay, I shouldn't touch it.
That's all, isn't it?
Mother.
Why did you shout like that?
To scare you.
Got scared, didn't you?
You went little over board.
Did you see? My dress.
It's here only.
Here.
Here... here...
Have this juice.
Is your practicing going on well?
- It's going on well, mother.
Finish your juice and
give me the glass.
I'll bring the glass... You go out.
- You finish it first.
You go out, I'll bring it.
What's it, mother?
Move away. - What?
Move.
Come on, move I say.
Move... don't block my view.
What's it, mother?
Something is missing from this doll.
It's a doll, isn't it?
May be it's lifeless.
This is missing from it. - Mother!
Vermilion? I'll keep it.
Give it to me.
Look, how beautiful it's now.
You must get such a beautiful wife.
Let's try it... Okay... Come
...Come... hold this glass.
Come.
I've brought a new cell phone.
I must hear your voice first
in this SIM card.
That's why, leaving out Savithri,
I've called you first.
I'll tell you my number,
please take down.
Who're you all?
Come to the matter.
Oh! Are you a Sugar Patient?
No, jaggery patient, I may've anything.
Why're you worried? Come to the point.
Matter is... his cousins' passport.
- We'll send it by post.
That means, you'll not hand it
over personally. - No.
Money is lying on the table,
is it yours?
No, it's yours! Take it and
put into your pockets.
Otherwise, police will come
and take it.
500 kgs Laddus...
800 kgs Jilebis...
Will you take your sweet
shop outside?
I'm expecting a call.
You come here.
You wait, man.
Then, you'll not give the
passport personally.
Giving passport personally
is against rules.
For God's sake.
Phone is very good.
What was his cell number?
What darling? Hey Tony!
It's me, Shiva.
Where're you, man?
Look Shiva, my name is Subramanyam.
This isn't Tony's phone number,
this is my phone.
This is not Tony's.
Tony's number must be having
some other number.
Cut the line.
You call him.
Tony, trouble has erupted
in old city.
Come quickly, bloody rascal
we're waiting for you.
Hey man! My name is Subramanyam.
I'm a passport officer, not Tony.
Someone had just called like this only.
Inform them also.
He has cut the line.
Now, it's Laddus' turn.
You call him.
Tony, it's me Feroze.
Hey, while coming home,
bring 8 kgs of chicken.
Hey listen, if possible get
a kilo of mutton also.
What's all this non-sense about
chicken & mutton, bloody fools?
My name is Subramanyam. I'm a passport
officer. Cut the call.
I'll now give the finishing touch.
Watch out.
I'm Tony speaking,
did I get any phone calls?
Tony! Am I your personal
telephone operator?
I'm a Passport Officer.
I bought a new cell phone.
One calls & says I'm Shiva.
Another calls up me to old city.
Another calls up and asks me
to bring chicken & mutton.
Why're you torturing me like this?
It isn't you who's torturing me?
...This cell phone.
This is torturing me.
If I didn't have a cell phone.
Yes.
Where's your passport?
- It's here only.
Take it... take all passports.
Here it is.
Your darlings' phone call.
Passport work is over.
Now, it's time to get Visa.
Police have seized the Gypsy in which
you brought Swapna from Kurnool.
What're we going to do now?
What're you boys doing here?
Seeing a crowd here...
Curiosity brought us here.
What's there to see here?
Go & practice your game.
Till now, we were practicing.
Don't just make empty promises
about winning cups.
You must win & show it.
Go & practice till you win the cup.
Sir, sniffer dogs are on the way.
Sniffer dogs mean... lt'll find smell,
follow you to your home.
If your father's comes
to know this?
Swapna, it isn't safe to
be here any more.
I think, we'll get caught.
Come, let's go away from here.
Who's that Swapna?
Swapna? Who's Swapna?
Will you tell me about her?
Or shall I tell father?
I beg of you, please don't tell anyone.
- Okay, what's the matter?
Asha, who else do I've
other than you?
Whether its elder or younger sister,
its you only, isn't it?
Come to the point, brother.
Who's this Swapna?
That is...
I'll follow all your orders.
If you want occupy this room also.
Save me from this crisis.
You both go to the
terrace immediately.
If anyone comes in,
I'll manage.
I think kidnapper is very clever.
He has taken all precautions.
Sniffer dogs' efforts have
also turned futile.
I feel he has left the Gypsy
here to mislead us.
But, still don't give
up your hopes.
If you need, request Task Force's
support also.
You never go home through right path,
that saved you the day.
Buddy, dogs failed to find anything.
- No clues were found.
The girl is safe, isn't she?
Didn't I warn you earlier your
father is a dictator?
Not to keep that girl
in your house.
We've been saved because
police were mislead.
By the way, where's that girl?
Where're they?
Look there, come quickly.
Then, I'll take Swapna with me &
finish the Visa work.
You keep track of National
Games' proceedings.
Okay, buddy.
Didn't I tell you my brother had
brought a girl from Kurnool?
This is that girl.
The dress she's wearing also mine,
you know that?
Come, shake hands with her.
What's this? Do you think
the girl is a doll?
Says how cute!
Why did you bring all your gang?
Is there anyone yet to know, have you
finished telling the entire town?
You shut up.
Swapna, you don't worry
we all are with you.
You come to school with us.
- To school?
No need to be patient any more.
Laddu. - Yes, buddy.
Take and buy them ice-creams,
chocolates, Lollipops & Laddus also.
Come... Come girls... what do you want?
Cadbury or Lollipop?
Don't you sell King Fishers
and Bagpipers?
Okay, buy them that.
Brother... Father...
Come, Swapna.
Asha, come here.
Come... - I'll not come.
Stop.
Stop, I say.
Stop.
Hey brother, catch her.
Sister, stop.
Brother, run fast.
Mad fellows.
- Brother, catch her.
Stop.
Brother catch her.
- Brother, catch me.
What might have happened?
May be she has remembered
her own folks.
What shall we do, brother?
What day is today?
How can you know days & date?
Today, its Friday.
So, don't cry today.
If you want, cry tomorrow.
Looks like you had cried
yesterday also.
But, don't cry today.
Turn back and see.
So today, it's your birthday.
Blow it.
Lollipop, what're you watching?
Offer her cake.
For whom did you bring this?
Sir, we must start
the consecration also.
You take bath and come, sir.
You'll be dead next moment.
Now, he's in Love meditation.
He'll not take bath.
You consecrate it with milk.
Milk... Milk...
Consecrate it with Milk.
Yes, it's me Dhoondy.
Yes, what you heard is true.
It's that girls' idol only.
You heard about temple built for
Amitabh in Kolkota & Kushbu in Tamil Nadu.
Obul Reddy is praying that
girl like a Goddess.
Offerings? Is it Lord Sathyanarayana's
prayer to offer offerings?
Don't spread this news.
I'll cut the line now.
What's this sir, he's wasting 100 ltrs
of Milk, 50 ltrs honey & 50 ltrs ghee.
He can give it to a poor man
like me, can't he?
If you go and give him this idea.
He'll drain out all your blood &
consecrate the idol with it.
The problem isn't that.
The entire State is eagerly
waiting, when he'll take bath.
Elder son.
Have you finished your
meeting in A.C. Rooms?
How many more days will you keep
on searching that girl?
He's going madder with
every day passing.
I feel he'll turn into a stone
praying madly.
This is turning to be
a futile exercise.
Shall I get Lorry loads from
Jammalamadugu & Allagadda?
They'll go on behead people,
till they find that boy.
I'm giving you just one more day.
Find her, bloody fool!
You follow me.
Did you hear that?
If the matter goes to her,
this will be the style.
You don't know about my mother.
C. M had offered me Ministry of
Home after meeting her.
She'll do what she says, be careful.
- You take this sir.
That girl's photo is in this,
take it.
Oh! What's bad dream!
Who's this girl? Looks like
new to this area.
This was the girl who was dancing
with Ajay 2 days earlier.
Why is she coming out
at this hour?
Is this girl having any connection
with Ajay's change of heart?
Let's ask her.
What is Kurnool's code?
That side.
What's it?
What're you doing here?
We came out for a tea. - Finished your
tea, isn't it? Go... Go home.
Where's your home?
- Near by only.
Come, I'll drop you.
- No problem, I'll go myself.
My house is also nearby only.
Come, I'll drop you and go.
You go now and come back
early morning.
Come.
I never saw you in this street.
We've come here recently.
Uncle, I'll go.
This area isn't that safe, no problem.
I'll drop you at home.
Come.
This is my house. - This one?
Yes. I'll go now, uncle.
I had come up to here. Come, I'll hand
over you to your people & go.
This boy?
Would you please give me some water?
Looks like he's a sticky fellow.
He's not leaving me.
Please come in.
Please come in...
Please sit down.
Please, give him company.
Come...
You keep talking to each other,
I'll get water for you.
She's... his younger sister.
Correct uncle!
Hey, greet uncle.
Greetings, uncle.
I'll get water for you.
Who's this girl?
- It seems she's his fiancee.
It seems she's her sister-in-law.
What're you to her, then?
- Mother-in-law.
Mother-in-law... Mother-in-law.
Good.
What's all this meeting prospective
bride at night?
Stop feeling shy.
She's beautiful even when I see
her with sleepy eyes.
What've you studied?
Do you know to sing & dance?
You might be knowing it all.
My mother-in-law talks very funnily.
What's all this meeting
prospective bride?
Marriage is nearing
What's all this?
Have you fixed the marriage
without informing me?
They had informed me also, just now.
Hello, why isn't the groom
saying anything?
Sir, will you marry here or
in your father-in-law's place?
Why do you want to know all that?
I mean, why do you want
to know it now?
Poor uncle, I think he has
plenty of leisure time.
He's sticking around here without
going to his home.
He asked for water...
If I give... he'll go...
Give me your hand.
Can't you help me without
standing & watching fun?
Not me... help him.
You had to face unnecessarily problems
in your home also for me.
It's quite common to me.
You don't worry about it.
Looks like National games are
also fast approaching.
You don't seem to be
practicing also.
For the present, I don't have one goal,
but two goals.
To send you to America
and win the cup.
Where am I to hide you?
I must hide you secretly like Sorcerer
hiding Princess in a one pillar palace.
Come here.
Oh God! I'm getting crazy ideas.
- What ideas?
Do you feel like presenting
the crescent moon to me?
I feel like scratching
my back with it.
Don't know what magical effect
you've created on me?
It's good... what next?
Just a minute...
Do you feel cold? - No.
Give me your chunni.
Give me, I'm feeling cold.
Magic? Did I do?
Don't know what magical effect,
you've created on me?
Oh Heart! Tell me the truth.
Suddenly, I feel asleep.
Song is over?
Yes.
Looks like day is breaking in.
By the way, I forgot to tell you,
your visa is ready.
Your flight is scheduled
at tomorrow afternoon.
Yes sir, we saw her.
The man you're searching Ajay is non
other than S.P. Vijay Verma's son.
He lives in old city area.
Yes sir, very near to Charminar.
I think he'll now take bath.
Hey, search everywhere.
He'll be somewhere here only.
Come out.
Do you know in whose house
you're creating trouble?
Don't ask me that question.
Ask your son, he'll answer.
He'll say father, I've eloped with his
fiancee, he might've come for her.
I don't have any interest in anything
other than a girl's body.
For the first time, in my life,
I fell in love.
I've become mad for her.
She has mesmerized me.
I can't see anything else.
I can see only that girl and
your son, who eloped with her.
I'll see his end.
Brother, there's a secret way
out from the room.
Hey, this area is very good.
On one side, I feel like eating a sweet
betel leaf from my lover Swapna.
Another side, I feel like behead your son
and hang it on the Charminar.
DCP, you might have seen
communal clashes here.
Beheading people of our caste.
You might've not seen rivers of flood
flowing into Thungabhadra river.
I'm giving you one more day's time.
If you don't hand over your son
and my fiancee, I'll kill...
What're you watching?
These father & son are cheats.
Beware of them.
He has eloped with my lover.
You'll get punished for
their mistake.
I'll not beat anyone.
I'll kill.
Come on, boys.
Are tickets reserved? - Yes.
Reporting time is
exactly at 3.20 P.M.
Ajay, situation is very serious.
Obul Reddy has warned your father to
hand over you & Swapna in 24 hrs.
Buddy, your father called us to
Police station & interrogated.
Though we hoarsely cried we don't know,
he never cared.
Beat us also.
On one side Police & Obul Reddy's
men on the other side.
They've swarmed all over the city.
Our area is out of bounds for us.
Leave alone taking her to
the Airport.
Even going out of this neighbourhood
is also impossible.
I suspect they're watching
all our movements.
They've influence in the
higher echelons of power.
I don't have any doubts over it.
We'll be careful.
Keep these with you.
Leave this place quietly,
as strangers.
Give me information about
their movements.
We'll meet again in the
Airport at 3 PM.
That girl must leave this place,
at any cost.
I feel very sad on hearing
about leaving us.
We had come closer in a
short period of time.
What're you going to study
in America?
Don't know! I must decide
after reaching there.
When will you come again?
Don't know.
Will you come back?
Don't know.
Can't you continue your
studies here only?
What? Are you making her to cry?
When she's going to foreign to study.
What's your problem?
Do you want a lollipop?
Not only me, even she's crying.
You see this.
Do you also want a lollipop?
That's your talent.
You can make anyone to cry.
What about your talent, then?
Is it not to understand anyone?
No, to remain an enigma.
I mean, I'm going way, ain't I?
Aren't you feeling sad?
Why should I? It's a happy news.
I feel very sad.
To leave you, your house,
your people & friends.
I'm not able to go away.
Then, I'm also feeling sad.
You're going away, aren't you?
There'll be no more chases,
tensions and adventures.
But, I'll get the National Cup.
Is it necessary to discuss all this
in these tense moments?
Your clothes are in this bag.
I think you didn't eat
anything last night also.
There're some eatables also in it.
Change quickly & come down.
We must escape from here before the
security guards change for duty.
Buddy, phone.
We're in a fix. Police have found
your hiding place.
What happened, buddy?
Buddy, there's only one hour for
the reporting time.
You take Asha and leave
this place immediately.
Surrender yourself!
You've been surrounded by Police.
You can't escape from them.
Ajay, you don't have any
other option. Surrender.
What day is today? - Friday.
I'm not crying, am I?
Great joke!
What's going to happen here
every Friday at 1.45 PM?
You can watch it in few minutes.
Sit down.
Ajay, police are after you.
Sir, it's time for Muslims to offer
prayers, they're going for it.
It's highly sensitive area.
If you fire at them and if any
untoward incident happens...
Then, go & search them.
Kurnool goons are behind you,
watch out!
Ajay, Obul Reddy's men are
waiting at Patel Market.
Police is also there.
You take to Pattargatti Road.
Tell me, what's it?
Hold on the line for a moment.
Hold this.
Give me. Give it to me.
Now, tell me.
A van is ready near
Begumpet Bus stop.
Don't take the risk of travelling
long distance on a bike.
Swapna, come & sit.
Don't get tensed up.
You'll go away safely.
Okay?
How much time do we still
have for reporting?
40 minutes.
40 M I N U T E S!
Okay, 40 M I N U T E S.
What do you want?
I want to eat that.
Pani pouri? Have you gone crazy?
It's getting late for the flight.
We've 40 minutes, haven't we?
Finish it quickly.
Boy, serve her quickly.
- Yes sir.
No, nearby only.
We'll be there in another 15 minutes.
Okay. There's absolutely no tension.
A girl was standing here,
where's she?
She finished eating and
went that side only.
Where did you go away?
Here only... to shop!
Is it time to shop?
Will you go away without
informing me?
Do you know how tensed
I had been?
You don't seem have the tension which I've.
Is it me or you, who's going?
For you.
You missed a match because of me.
As a remembrance from me, wishing you to
win National Cup this time.
Knee Cap.
Is it the time for it?
Okay, come.
Swapna, in few hours from now,
you'll be...
You've a feeling of void and a little
disappointment, haven't you?
Your face is giving in.
I don't want you to go
with that feeling.
So, I've a little surprise for you.
You had accused me of not able to
understand a woman's heart, hadn't you?
Look at there.
My child Swapna!
It isn't good for them to
stay here for a long time.
Go and drop them.
Swapna, it's time for your flight.
Swapna, this is your passport.
Take the boarding pass
after going inside.
Since, yours is a student visa,
there won't be much formalities.
Your certificates & balance
money are in this.
Will you buy clothes on
reaching there? Okay?
I forgot something.
Oh! I've got it.
I talked to your uncle last night.
They'll come to the Airport
to pick you up.
I've written their phone numbers
here, okay?
No confusion, isn't it?
Will you call back on
reaching there?
Call your father. They'll be
relieved to hear you.
Will you travel carefully?
You're not a small girl, are you?
Time is up, get inside.
Give me the bike keys.
We must start practice immediately,
we'll go to the ground.
Come on, get going.
Swapna, come & sit.
For you only.
I can't go away leaving you.
I'm not able to go.
I want you.
I feel like spending all my
life with you.
I can't cheat myself and go away.
If you're with me, I'll not be
afraid of anyone.
I can't say any more.
I want you.
Take him away.
I told you not to get involved
in unnecessary trouble.
Did you hear my advice?
At last! What have you achieved?
You reached up to the finals of
State level championship.
To help someone you gave up the
game and cheated us.
Later, you said you'll play
for the Nationals.
What happened?
Tomorrow night it's Finals
for National Cup.
And you're here, behind the bars.
Aren't you ashamed?
Aunt, how do I look?
If I say, I think you'll
hold my hand.
You said it right.
I feel you'll cast an evil eye
on my son.
Whether you behead anyone
or comb your hair.
You're like your father.
Stop feeling handsome.
Try to bring that girl to your way.
Shouldn't we make her a bride?
Isn't your marriage at
11 P.M. Tomorrow night?
To keep her away from
committing suicide.
Try to win her heart. Go.
What's this? I thought
you'll be crying?
But you're eating country chicken.
Why should I cry?
Yes, I can't bear to see
you cry, can I?
Will you eat this leg piece for me?
- No. I've finished.
What gift do you want
for our marriage?
I'll ask my husband & tell you.
Your husband? - Yes, that man only.
One who's smart.
Don't you remember him?
That day in Kurnool.
...ln Konda Reddy Burge centre.
Beating you black & blue.
One who had taken me.
Forgot him?
Is it?
I left him since he appeared
like a young boy.
But, he's now caught.
By now he would've got admitted
into some hospital.
Oh Reddy! Why would he be
in some hospital?
One who could take me from you
in our town.
Can't he come here?
He'll come.
He'll take me along with him.
He'll marry me.
You can also come & bless us.
Do you've so much faith in him?
I was with him all these days.
Don't I know his capacity?
Bloody.
I planned to have atleast
one woman after marriage.
Situation isn't favourable to me.
Hey, come here.
Come here, I'll show you
my capacity.
Capacity... Capacity. - Leave me.
He's always like this.
He can't stop himself once
he gets into the mood.
You all go to your rooms
and close the doors.
You go ahead, son.
- Come... Come...
Where're you going away?
You wanted to see my
capacity, didn't you?
Come, I'll show you my manliness.
- Leave me.
You're thinking its manliness to
enjoy a woman against her wish.
That isn't manliness.
A woman must desire a
man on her own.
I desire Ajay like that.
He's a real man.
If you've guts.
If you're really a man.
You win over him & marry me.
Then, I'll accept you as a man.
If it happens, I'll become
your wife.
Before that, if you marry me
forcibly like a coward.
Even if you touch me.
It won't be you, who'll
appear before me.
Oh! The bride is feeling shy.
Let her feel, later on there won't
be anything to feel shy.
I want him.
A case has been booked on him.
I had complained against him.
I'm withdrawing my complaint.
I want him.
Come.
DCP, are you worried about your son?
I'm not worried about my son.
I'm worried about you.
Go...
What's this? The girl there &
your father here.
...Are praising you to the hilt.
Are you such a great man?
That girl had openly challenged me.
She promised to marry me
if I win over you.
So, I'm thinking of killing you
and marry her.
Do you've a cigarette?
I think, he knows he's
going to die.
His last wish,
give him a cigarette.
Wow! A great place!
Stop the vehicle.
Boys! Take out your weapons.
Come boys.
He had escaped in Kurnool.
Now, take away any part
you like from his body.
Did you see classical
film 'Patala Bhairavi'?
I had seen it 10 times.
In that film, Sorcerer plans
behead Thota Ramudu.
But Thota Ramudu beheads the Sorcerer.
- Is it?
Then, am I the Sorcerer &
he the Thota Ramudu?
But, it is impossible here.
You're surrounded my men.
It's my men, who're
surrounding them.
Any man wearing a white dress
isn't a factionist.
This isn't Kurnool.
This's old city.
Cover him up with this.
Tonight, we're winning
the National Cup.
Then, what about Swapna?
If the groom is here.
How'll she get married?
What shall we do with him?
Bring him to the Stadium.
He'll watch, our match.
In few moments from now match between
Andhra Pradesh & Punjab will begin.
Spectators are welcoming the players
with thundering ovation.
It's brother, man.
You must definitely win
the National Cup.
As a remembrance for you.
Andhra Pradesh Team's captain
Ajay will take the first bow.
Starting an assault on the
opponents on the left side.
He's trying to force his way
into by breaking the cordon.
With great acumen,
trying to forge ahead.
True! Obul Reddy isn't in
the Marriage hall.
Any news?
I've called everyone I know.
I'm waiting for reply.
Hey! Ramulamma. - What?
Where's Reddy?
Which Reddy?
That one... Your son.
Bride groom.
...Obul Reddy.
Where's he?
It's getting late for the marriage.
Priest. - Madam.
Make her recite hymns.
- Yes, madam.
Score is Punjab - 28
and Andhra Pradesh - 23
Andhra Pradesh is behind Punjab.
Punjab players have caught him.
They're pushing him behind.
Come.
Come...
Come...
Ajay of Andhra Pradesh
is disappointed.
Come here... Come...
You? Where're you calling from?
Madam, Jr. Boss's phone.
Where're you?
Your brother is searching
entire town for you.
It's getting late for the marriage.
Come here immediately.
I'm not coming there,
you bring her here.
She'll see herself who's a real man.
You haven't gone mad, have you?
Look, everyone have assembled here.
It won't be good.
You come here immediately
and marry her.
We'll take care of him later.
Yuck, bloody woman. How could
I be born as your son?
The girl who challenged
my manliness.
How can I marry her like a eunuch?
Bring her here.
Bloody, I'll show her the
manliness of Rayalaseema.
Marriage isn't here... there.
Punjab is safely in winning
position with higher points.
To bring victory to Andhra with great
support & applause from spectators.

to win by catching Ajay.
Ajay, do it.
Stop.
We must decide between ourselves,
who's the real man.
Hey, I'm telling you confidently
win over him.
Play a game of Kabaddi
with him.
Call DGP on phone & tell him every
policeman must be here.
You would be better sleeping, if you're
awake, you'll do like this only.
Yes, how can you forget that
we're between people?
What's this playing politics?
You'll not be able to do it.
Move... l'll decide it myself.

Hey! Foolish Dog
Don't bring it.

Throw it away.
Don't bring it.
Throw it away.
Oh my God.
Throw it away.
Hey, take out my weapon.

If you get tensed up,
you'll lose your position.
Take it as everything had
happened in your sleep.
Oh! I'm getting crazy ideas.
- What ideas?
I feel like presenting you
that moon. - No...
You're with me, aren't you?
That's enough.
