No, I'm not going.
-yes, go
You little shit.
-Oh, you shut up!
You see?
You're nervous?
-Yeah
At the end of the test you said
you were sure of yourself.
Yeah, but with the exam people
you never know.
In any case dad, if I passed it?
What difference would it make?
Degree or no degree,
i'd still be unemployed.
Let's go.
It's already done anyway.
I.D. Card
Sanquin Julien
Failed
See? at least he passed
-Him? I doubt, I know him.
You register for next class,
we'll pass next year together
I present you my study crib
The "Louis the 14th Court".
Next year enrollment...
Not going too crazy..
I have to say that the
results this year...
No one knows...
And now, information about
the Baccalaureate.
The average is 59% country wide.
The record is held by the School
St Louis De Gonzague
with a 95% acceptance rate
And at the end of the spectrum.
We find School Louis the 14th
With 0% acceptance.
I indeed said, 0% acceptance.
For them, the situation
can only get better.
I'll see you for the News at 8.
Thanks for watching.
Where's Leon?
Leon.. Leon
For 20 years I said Hallelujia
to everything you do.
You do whatever you please.
Today, we see the result from your
pedagogic permissive methods
100% failure rate.
You understand?
You can imagine the pain this
free publicity has caused us.
Parents demand a repressive
system for their kids.
Repressive, listen, can you hear me
when I talk, it's in the newspaper.
Repression, they'll get some repression
They'll pay for the repression..
Understood Leon?
- Yes
Look at them, having fun.
Moving around...
Have fun, while you
still have time..
Shit, my mo-ped!
We don't know them and
I already hate them..
hate them..
We're from a different world.
We are classy...
They are Nouveau riche..
Aren't they..
Only because of money
Without money
we would sell this place...
Never would I ever sell
this property.
So they'll have it, their baccalaureate.
They'll have it.. Little monsters...
By force or not, they'll have it.
Even you...
Baptiste Lavalle, our best "client"
You'll pass your Bac..
Hello girls..
Ah, we have more than
just ugly girls this year..
If you need information about the dorm
situation, ask me, I've been a "client"
for 4 years now..
What about me?
-Hey Julien, how are you doing?
This is Julien, he is the medical certificate
provider, whatever the type you need.
Oh, good thing you brought your
marmite.
I bet you, I eat in it before Xmas.
Wanna bet?
Hey little one, do you know
you'll have your greatest school year
of your life?
It's still not opened.
Are you that much in a hurry?
-Yeah, if we want to pass the Bac,
we can't waste anytime.
Hey, is this your car?
Yeah it's mine..
Well, not exactly mine,
it's my dad's..
With the chicks, on the
first day, you understand...
Hold on,
Women and children first..
My children, I'm on the mission
to make out of you,
Baccalaureate degree holders
Some might say
Mission Impossible..
I'm taking on the challenge
And I'll win..
You will leave my school
with your baccalaureate.
When you'll see the P.E. teacher.
You'll understand why I've been here
for 4 years.

Yeah, so I was enjoying my morning ice-cream,
I turn around, some bastard steals my mo-ped.
Did you see the guy?
-Yeah but his back and from far away
So, what are you gonna do?
-Well I'll buy another one, I can't walk everywhere.
"Nice to meet you"
English is not interesting?
-blah
Is this language not widely
spoken enough for you?
No use in learning
any foreign languages
Is French enough for you?
-No, but we have machines for translation.
Why would I bust my balls?
Enchante de faire votre connaissance
-Nice to meet you.
One day I won't even have to type.
I would speak, and it would
translate it directly. So, Frankly
Why busting my balls?
How much do you want to spend on your mo-ped?
-500 or 600 Francs, no more..
I might have one around that price.
-Ah yeah?
I might be interested.
Ok.
Get out..
Get out, or I'll open.
I have a key you know..
It is strictly forbidden to smoke
in the bathrooms.
I know you're here.
I know you're here.
The smoke doesn't bother you?
-You'll change your habits, kiddo
Get out, get out.
I'll get them under control
Where are the bathrooms?
-1st door on the left, it's written on the door.
You can't miss it.

He ate Mamour..
Police!!
Police!
He scarfed down my dog
He scarfed down my Mamour.
But this is my car..
Evidently, it's not mine.
I don't have a car..
If everybody was like me
there would be no cars
But it's not bothering
anyone here!
It was not bothering anyone!
-Everybody says that..
There are 10 millions cars
that don't bother anyone.
So, there you go.
Not bothering...
It's destroyed now..
-Yeah, yup. Well it won't bother anymore..
again..
Get out, i know you're here
It is forbidden to smoke in the bathrooms.
You know it.
That's something.
He won't get out..
Why not?
-When I say no. It doesn't mean "no"
No it's not yes.
But it depends where..
Well listen.
In my parent's apartment, there's a room
at the end of the hallway, is that ok?
-No, not exciting enough.
So it means no.
-Yes, it will always be No.
Except during classes
What during the classes?
With this, you drop some catalyst on these crystals.
From which, smoke,
if there's smoke, there's a reaction..
Your turn now.
I'm selling you my mo-ped for 700 Francs.
-700 Francs?
-yup
You think she's monitoring us?
She must have installed something
Tell me, still on what we talked about earlier?
-Well, yes..
Ok, don't move.

Business is business.
Dressed like this will get you in
trouble with the director.
-No worries.
So how's the girl that'll end

Say, can't you find him a girlfriend
coz he's starting to annoy me.
Here, 500, 600

so no one will steal it from you.
What's the matter?
-Locker room.
What about the tie?

Can I go?
No, No Mrs.
Pants are forbidden.
From 1921 to 1929, the USA became
the most prosperous ever in history

Of course.. You're right,
It's my fault.
Everything is my fault.
They're always right!
They are young, and I'm not!
So I must, I must let them be.. huh?
I'm here for that, so go right ahead
I can't say anything, go ahead,
walk all over me..
It's been 4 years, 4 years you've
been getting on my nerves..
For 4 years, every year, failing your
baccalaureate just to piss me off when
I'm trying to eat.
I think you want me to relocate
in the Ardeches.
want me to snap!
I won't snap.
I'll stay here and I will eat.
I'll eat my carrots, like I do
everyday.
You live at your parents?
- No, they're separated, my mom in Canada
My father in Australia

Mrs, please find your seat
Don't bother anyone..
What are you doing here?
Why are you crying?
I'm going to be late for work.

I start my shift at 9, as a casheer.
Hey, yesterday, someone
stole my mo-ped
Shit, so what now?
-Well I'm gonna have to buy another one,
but my insurance won't like this.
I can sell you mine if you want.
- What about you?
I'll borrow my cousin's.
Yeah, but I really liked the color.
No problem, i can paint it the
same color, no charge.
well, that's really nice of you.
Well, for each family it's not much.
But for us, in the end, it starts to
accumulate nicely.
Don't hang up
yes, on white paper.
Stop this..
Stop this,

Not funny

What an idiot, seriously.
In any case, this skirt is not flattering
It's a little skirt I found, i think it fits very well.
- No, I like you better with your white dress..
with the sun, the blue flowers..
It's more flattering.
You think?
-Oh yeah
-Ok, enough, I'll change
There you go, much better.
-Silence..
So, The American automotive industry..
The European and American forces

The inequality in men, is or isn't
an obstacle to the citizens' equality.
What are they doing?
North West...
North East for charcoal..
South for the oil.
West....
So we were at, the opposition

which could be natural or from birth..
Hey guys! She's at it again!

lot of work..
I have work to do!
If her mother saw her!
Little bastards..

For you too!
You like him?
Want me to hook you up?
here you go..
So, don't move.
I'll send him over..
Julien, come here
Can you do me a favor?
I forgot my book, can you
grab it from my room?
This smells fishy.
-No, nothing fishy, I don't want to
get caught by the director..
If you don't want to go, no big deal.
-No, it's ok, I'll go.
Nice of you
What are you doing here?
Tell me Caro.
Want to do me a favor?
I forgot my book upstairs, can you
go ahead and bring it to me?
Seriously, I want you to go as
I don't want the director to know I'm
squatting in her attic.
Can you go?
It would really help me
Ok
Caro...
You're nice..
Hey if Julien comes back, can
you tell him I'll be right back?
-Yeah, you can count on me..
It's not that I don't want you.
It's not the problem.
But if we really analyze this..
It's always the same thing
If there are no feelings, we
can't sublime
I'm with Caroline..
And with her, you sublime?
-With her, it is sublime, it's never boring.
With me, it may be even better..
I'm with Caroline.
-She won't know anything.
Where's his book?
Right here.
-Give it to me..
Come get it.
-Give it to me now.
Ah shit..
Listen Caroline, I'll explain..
It's one of Bebelle's trick.
-Yeah that's it
-I think we'll have a little fun
What's going on?
The bastard, what a bastard!
Do you know what Julien was doing?
-No?
-He was fucking Jeanne in the attic..
Oh the bastard, the bastard, the bastard!
What are you going to do?
-I'll make him pay
-I'd do the exact same thing..
I'm gonna fuck the 1st guy.
-Bravo, and who?
Him... or him...
Wait, do you know what
the worst is for a guy?
That his girlfriend fucks his best friend.
You sure?
-The statistics are very accurate.
His best friend?
-Oh yeah yeah yeah
And I'm not telling you this because I'm his best friend.
-No, I know..
What are you doing tonight?
-Tonight, I'm busy..
No, no, wait, I can cancel..
Thank you.
If that makes you happy

get undressed
No lights?
No, because of my parents
It's a dude?
Very good
Much better performance than usual.
Well go ahead as if we weren't here.
In any case I don't want to anymore.
Oh come on...
A little, a quick one...
Stop it, I said I don't want to.
I have something to tell you.
-Sit down
I'm pregnant
Whose is it?
-You all
You sure?
Look..
It's not mine.
Gotta throw this thing away..
It's not happening in there.
Your dad is a Doctor?
Could arrange something?
I'm keeping it.
...(classroom material)...
For Mr Gaetan:
10min Physical Education
Ma'am
Why?
I'm sorry, I don't want
overcrowded classrooms
Every teacher has better
control over every students if the
classes are less crowded.
I understand Ma'am.
-Wait, I can take one more student.
In what section?
-B
-Ah
B, as in Baptiste.
He's a good student.
I don't know, but I know
he's a good worker.
So rare nowadays..
He really wants his Baccalaureate,
He'll work hard toward that.
Good recruit.
The trimester is payable in advance.
-(Math Course Topic)-....
I'd like to introduce a new student
who'll finish the year with you..
Come in.
Silence!
Silence!
Move to the back,
Sit here.
Sir, Mam'
What's your name?
Student Gaston Pourquier.
Here, there you go.
-Thanks, can you do the exact same in
Balsa wood?
Yeah, there's trouble in the air..
At the end of the year you know
you have to get your Bac..
There we go.
Go ahead, hammer it in
Shhh.
Hammer it in, slowly still..
Ok, try, go under.
Oh shit, this is very bad
news for the gorilla.
in 1919, (class material)..
A crazy night of love, all you can give me
Wanna bet?
What do you have to lose?
To spend a really bad night.
Excuse me, am I bothering you?
As a matter of fact, a little. yes.
-A little gym class would do you?
This, I'd like!
You see, it's very relaxing..
Of course.
Bruce!
Alright!
What's going on?
Possible to work here?
Go on Ma'am, go on..
We spend enough money for this, huh?
Go on!
What is this?
-It's super.
Listen, go play with the kids.
But what is it?
-Coke..
Can I try?
Got money?
-Yeah
-Give him 10 Francs.
Here, you shake very very hard.
The idiot.
You overdosed..
..(Math class material)..
Hey, it's the 3rd time
you dropped your metal ruler
I'm sorry Sir.
(Math class material)..
Young man, can you repeat your question?
Be kind, I'm asking you to
speak louder, you see?
So,
well,
so..
What's happening?
Can you speak louder?
What's he saying?
Huh?
I don't get it..
You understand French?
I'm asking you to speak louder!
Not normal..
This is not normal..
WHO?!?
Who did this again?
This is not possible..
This is not possible!
Are they all mentally challenged?
The best of them gets a 6 out of 20!
I will force them, but they will have their Bac..
All lame!
Not possible!
My children, what can I say?
You're on the right path..
Yes, yes..
If the preliminary test you just took was
the official test in June for the Baccalaureate.
You'd all be graduating..
Come on..
I'm very happy, you finally
realized the importance of this
degree for your future.
The Bac, an old dream...
who might become reality..
See, for me, I don't see how i could get it
-By working hard you see..
It'd be known if you can get the
Bac by just working,
-Believe me, it's known..
The only way I could ever get my Bac
would be to remove the tests.
Or, randomly pick the people
Like the lottery..
It's true, it'd be much more fair to
everybody with the lottery system.
High income family or low worker,
Same luck for everybody from the start.
Absolutely, and later in life, same thing.
Everbody works, at the end of the month,
with the pay check, just like the lottery..
So, one time you get 10 grand.
Next time, maybe the minimum wage..
You really think so?
-It's useless, there's gonna be an atomic war
So, bac or no bac..
I'm all for the atomic war
I want it to start before i get kids..
Yeah, a great atomic war,very pretty.
Coppola style, with blue, green, red mushrooms.
And in the background, some music, like Wagner..
Yeah that'd be awesome. It'd clear the crap
we've been in for the last 30 years...
I personally think that they are very pessimistic.
I want to get my Bac.
Because later I want
to get married..
Then I'll want kids
Who'll get their Bac
so they can get married..
What you're saying is
really pretty..
Well I would marry a guy who
has his Bac and super rich..
For me, my future is
already  set
Bac or no Bac,
I'll be a minister, at least..
And you Mr Pourquier
How do you see your future?
This is not for my future
I'm doing this..
Come on, come on.
You're the youngest here..
besides your results are more
than adequate...
just little details...
Congo is not under Belgium reign anymore.
Neither are the french colonies in Africa.
Silence....
And the Tsar of Russia
is not Nicholas the 4rth...
But Brejnev..
I swear Ma'am, it's written in my books..
You'll have to get some more recent ones.
-Ah.
My Children, given the excellent results.
I decided for all of us to spend the day in the
countryside..
With this, they'll have their Bac..
This is against my principles.
-Well, we all know your principles...
No Ma'am, I have my own set
of principles..
So kids, doing well?
-Very well Ma'am
-Good day yesterday?
Alright, good, let's be serious now.
I'll present you, your new teacher.
-A new teacher?
She'll get you up to speed
for your exam.
And she is...
How is she?
-She's superb.
Come on, let's go...
Where is she?
What's this?

She's from the USA.
So, who'll start?

The time is set for 12:30.
Wonderful idea with the pot.
The revolution gives ideas..
Our people will conquer..
-Our people will conquer.
Hmm it's good..
I'm gonna use the bathroom..
We need to reset the timer
so we get more time to alert the cops.
Otherwise it's all good...
The official lunch is exactly at 12:30
I know, i know.
You have to be in the kitchen before noon.
Oh Fuck.
This is not our bomb..
No more bomb?
Yes, there is one, but it's not ours!
No more weed for you..
There's a bomb! Fuck!
Of course there's a bomb.
We put it there.
Listen, I swear i'm not fucking around.
There's a bomb, it's huge!
Get it?
Everything's gonna blow!
We have to get the hell out!
There's a bomb! hide!
Sir! There's a bomb.
There's a bomb.
There's a bomb.
-Again?
-This time we did it..
It's a tiny one, but it's gonna hurt.
-Not working..
-
I mean there really
is a bomb.
Ours was going to blow at noon.
But we don't know when this one will blow.
Oh now, there are 2 bombs?
-Yes!
What you want is the afternoon off?
-No!, we don't even have class this afternoon.
So why this bomb alert?
Because there really is a bomb.
There really is a bomb!
Do you know what a bomb does?
-Yeah, it goes boom..
We've seen many of them..
Do you know what it'll cost
you to let a bomb explode?
Do you know what it costs to
annoy a Police officer?
There will be a lot of dead people..
-You're pissing me off too?
No assistance to a person in danger.
Your career....
What proof do you have that there's a bomb?
If there was no bomb, I would
have called you anonymously.
I wouldn't tell you in your face.
Think about it for 2 seconds..
My dear friends, you are very curious
But i'll tell you everything..
Couscous is made with rolled semoulina
Steam cooked, add butter..
But i'll show you
It's delicious..
Wonderful.
Fantastic.
Our people will conquer.
Chief! A bomb just exploded!
-Where?
-The D'Abou Yamen embassy
Under the stairs, in the kichen
Boss, I found it
Mommy
Mommy?
Mommy?
Lucy?
what's happening?
I can't believe this..
My god, oh my god.
This is not going to be good!
The bomb idea. was ours your Honor.
But the real one, the one that exploded
is not ours your Honor..
They are a nuisance to society
We must destroy them.
Before they destroy me.
I had no idea about this bomb story your honor
What were you doing during the explosion?
-He's an arnarchist.
Parade in 36..
It's him.
-I wasn't just me..
They are all terrorists!
-I know this case as well as you do.
I am convinced..
I understand you may be a little shocked
by the explosion..
But don't make it a personal matter..
Besides, the bomb maker..
-Mustafa Samid.
Mustafa Samid is in jail.
Hoodlums, 6 months minimum.
Minimum.
Yes, but we're not hoodlums...
Prove it.
-How so?
By getting your Baccalaureate..
Or else?
Or else? 6months,  1 year, 3 years..
You'll like jail.
This court is adjourned, the final
result will be delivered the same day
as the baccalaureate.
Now you have to get your Bac.
It's not possible.
We fucked around all year long.
Even if we crammed for 15days straight, 24/24
We will still fail it.
Listen, I don't want any scandals.
So you will get your Bac.
The judge said, jail or the Bac.
It will be the Bac.
In my position, i can't afford a scandal.
No scandal, understood?
It's a scandal.
A scandal!
I lock them, they release them!
The judge is a commie!
I am certain, the judge is a commie!
Chief, the judge wants you to know.
-Wants me to know what?
-To know...
Want you to know that you can be the
official monitor for the hoodlums's exams.
So they won't have their Bac
Because they won't be able to cheat.
I don't want my baby to be born in jail.
We'll bring you oranges
and baby bottles.
Don't worry, your baby should be born
during the exam.
That's not helping us?
-On the contrary, it may help us.
The right sole, is history.
The left is Geography
It can't fail.
It's how i passed mine.
There's a side taller than the other..
I don't write books, not my fault there's
more History than Geography.
So let's plug it in..
Let's go. It's plugged in..
