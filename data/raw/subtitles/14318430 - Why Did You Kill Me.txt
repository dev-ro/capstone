We were coming out of the house.
This is gonna be my car in the driveway.
And then the Ford Expedition drove past…
And you could just see
every seat was filled.
Crystal, Juan, and my son Justin
were getting in the car.
Get in the car, she popped
the seat forward. I was like,
"Scoot over.
We're not hitting no main streets."
"We're going three, four blocks up
the road to 7-Eleven. Scoot over, sis."
And, uh…
We didn't even make it past
the end of the street.
I get right up here.
I look over,
and he's standing there,
right by the stop sign.
And the white Ford Expedition
turns all the way around,
and he comes sliding back in,
and he stops right here.
I race this way,
and I stop to see
what's going on with the kids.
As we came around I look over,
there's a guy with a hooded sweater
with a gun, probably
a foot and a half away from me.
I see the gun.
And he was moving his mouth, like,
trying to work his way up to it.
Bang, bang, bang.
And all the explosions,
and the glass, the tires screeching.
We're getting several calls,
more than four shots heard…
The shots were fired, and, uh…
- They shot at you?
- They were shooting at me.
I just ducked down in the seat thinking,
"Oh, my God."
I don't even know if they hit the car.
I looked over at my sister
and she was just, like, motionless.
- What's the problem?
- The car came just barreling in.
-It's a Honda Accord. And they came up--
- What color Honda?
We made it
to right in front of a grocery store,
right in front of the doors.
I got out of the car, and I picked her up,
and I'm sitting there holding her.
Someone's been shot
that's on the floor.
It seems like she's not responding.
Address is…
And I felt her head, and…
RP's going to be responding.
It looks like we have a victim.
Patrol, what's your twenty…?
God says,
"Ask and you shall receive."
I did.
So where was he? He also says
everything is according to his plan.
What kind of fucked-up plan is that?
Where's the loving God in my life?
And I don't get it.
I just want to know why, you know? Why?
It was midnight, and my grandma
was in the living room crying.
And they said, "Crystal's been shot."
I said, "Crystal's been shot?" They said,
"Crystal's been shot in the head."
The first memory of Crystal I have,
she liked to play baby dolls with me,
and she would always ask me questions.
"Oh, Jaimie,
did Annabelle get her bottle?"
She would make, like…
She would make my playtime fun.
And, uh, she really did.
She opened my imagination.
She made sure
that I knew that nothing's impossible.
Everything is possible.
And I went on MySpace.
Tonight,
a horrible tragedy has happened.
I blogged about that.
That's how I got my emotions out.
I didn't cry at home.
I just typed.
I just let my fingers go and…
type away.
The very last sentence:
"Crystal, please be okay.
I love you more than life itself."
She didn't wake up.
I remember her being here and,
just expect her to…
walk through the door again.
It's not going to happen.
When we think of our family
and the good times, it's like,
there's a line drawn.
Before Crystal and after Crystal.
She… She was just my pride and joy.
I wanted a daughter so bad.
Had three sons.
And so the fourth one it was like,
"Yay, got my little girl."
She was my sunshine.
She was my life. My life. Yeah.
She would do anything.
She loved heights and roller coasters,
and she was so lucky at the casino.
She went to a machine
and put five dollars in it,
and won $38,000.
And started an air-conditioning
heating business with her husband.
They just took off with it.
And then her husband fell back
to drug use and the violence.
And so Crystal left him
and was back with us.
Yeah.
Just so many memories.
God, just so many memories.
A lot of good memories too,
but that one night,
that's all it takes.
Yeah, same tattoo on the neck.
We have a picture of a grim reaper
that sits on the desk
of the person who's next up.
It's like death is always
kind of waiting,
and when you're at the top
of the list, that's your case.
You have no idea
what you're going to catch.
And it was my turn.
We've got a shooting
over on the west end of the city,
so I get dressed, kiss my wife, drive in,
and then your brain starts running.
My first murder case was a gang shooting.
Those are always extremely difficult.
That one case, unfortunately,
remains open right now.
There's still a guy out there that's
gotten away with the ultimate crime.
I still think about it.
Uh, my second one
was the Crystal Theobald case.
I mean, I can't let two go.
There's just no way that two are gonna go,
but it started off pretty rocky.
They had multiple casings at the scene,
right at the intersection
of Greenpoint and Geranium.
They had what might've been
a shoe involved in it,
so they identified that for us.
But I get a chance to see
where evidence items are,
photographs and measuring
of evidence, video.
I'm… My brain was flooded,
especially being new in the unit.
It's almost like overload.
Riverside Police Department.
They had witness statements.
Gone door-to-door.
We do what we call a canvass.
- You didn't hear any gunshots?
- We were inside tonight.
You didn't hear anything
or see anything?
- I wasn't here.
- No, I was asleep.
You were asleep?
Anyone that might have either
ear or eyeshot of the incident.
You didn't hear any gunshots?
No. My wife said she heard,
you know, several pops, yeah.
She didn't see anything?
There were a couple of detectives
who were at the hospital.
They're trying to talk to the family,
but they're not being cooperative
with the detectives.
I didn't like them.
I didn't like them. Didn't…
Didn't like them one bit and…
you know, so…
She wasn't exactly trusting of me.
She didn't know who I was, and--
I didn't call the police to help me
if I had an issue.
I didn't. It wasn't the police I called.
They were coming at my family
like we were the ones that did it.
Threatening and telling my boys,
"I'll lock you up."
"You know, if we catch wind of…"
You know,  that made me upset.
They put me in handcuffs
and throw me in the back of a cop car
and interrogate me for hours.
And I didn't get it, didn't understand.
Took the detectives
and I told them, I said,
"My family had nothing to do with this."
You want them to know
I'm doing everything I can to help.
That's all I'm here for.
Whatever you got going on, unless
it's pertinent to my case, I don't care.
I'm here to try and solve
this homicide for you and your family,
and to put somebody
who killed Crystal away.
So then, you know, we opened up
a little more, but…
There's a lot of rumors running
around as to what might've happened.
What are you thinking is…?
I'm thinking there's been a lot
of gang problems with that, uh, 5150.
This is what we call the West End.
This kind of loop is where the actual
shooting took place,
but even more so
where 5150 claim territory.
Shouts out to Marlow.
But there were also
multiple other gangs, Black, Hispanic,
who laid claim to the same area.
So there's turf wars, and guys
that see each other. There'll be conflict.
Rival Latino and Black gangs
involved in drug trafficking…
5150 kind of came into existence
for us in Riverside
around 2003, give or take.
They tried to establish themselves
and made some inroads
into being a particularly violent
and confrontational gang,
graduating to assaults, to shootings,
to then, uh, murdering three people
within the city in the course
of two and a half to three years.
It was a very quick evolution.
We're in Riverside now.
All kinds of shootings, and every night
people will get stabbed, robbed.
As soon as people heard 5150,
like, they got scared.
You know, they said
we were murderers. We're killers.
Never once did I ever think
that society would look at us like that.
Originally Riverside was, uh…
It was kind of like an outcast from L.A.
All the people that couldn't afford
to live in L.A. or in Orange County,
they came out to Riverside.
So a lot of, I would say poor people.
I don't think we ever even went to,
like, the beach or Disneyland.
Nothing like that ever.
We never experienced anything
outside of, like, that area.
So we thought that that was life.
Fifty-one, fifty, it was like me
and my cousins or family members
backing each other up.
That was the whole motive.
Like, we're family. That was it.
We would all be out here.
Nothing really happening.
We were all under 18 years old, you know.
When we were kids, uh,
you know, everybody targeted us.
Give me a full description of this--
He was young.
He was young. He was a kid.
-But if I see him, I will know him.
- Okay.
Then there was more interviews
and looking at pictures.
This particular binder has got
all the different gang members.
And it kind of helps me to keep track
of who's who in the zoo.
I do remember Belinda telling me
the shooter had been a really young,
almost white-looking Hispanic guy,
like a real baby face.
She saw his face, and she'd absolutely
be able to identify him.
Wouldn't be a problem.
This is the sketch that was drawn based
off the information provided by Belinda.
I looked through annuals, yearbooks,
looking for people who are gang members
and have a current picture I can look at.
I'm talking with Belinda, I say,
"I got pictures I want you to look at."
She starts going through the pictures.
And she gets to a young kid.
And she stops
and says, "That's him."
One day Detective Wheeler called
and said that, uh,
they have somebody
they think might be involved in it,
and if they could drive me down there
to get a look at him.
And she IDs him.
"That's him. That's the guy."
You doing okay, dude?
We start pressing him on this case
and ask him where he was,
and he's given us a particular alibi
as to where he was, who he was with.
I wasn't there.
I know that you were, though.
I got somebody who identified you.
I'm telling him,
"We're gonna check this out."
"Don't lie.
I'll find out if you're lying to me."
We were at my house, and then we went
to his brother's girlfriend's house.
He's saying, "I wasn't there."
"I was over at a friend's house.
I was with a friend. You can call them."
"You can check with them."
I get a couple of my partners
to go over and verify his alibi.
And it's solid.
Please!
Let me go home!
Let me go gome.
So now I'm starting to think,
"Uh-oh, I got a bad ID here?"
"That's not a good start."
And we ended up sending him home.
They really didn't explain things to me
well enough,
like you make one mistake and
identify somebody that's not involved,
they can no longer use
what you have to say
when it comes to court.
So that complicated the case
for the detective.
You start off with a case very optimistic.
We'll handle this. This is gonna get done.
Then you reach a point to where
there aren't any more leads,
and… and now it's almost
a war of attrition.
And I promised her.
It was the last thing I got to say to her,
besides "I love you."
I promised her that I was gonna get him
if it's the last thing I do.
I'm gonna get him. They're gonna pay.
I guess I was, uh,
talking to Nick on MySpace,
and he had told me how the guys,
the people involved, had MySpace.
He said, "They all have profiles."
I pretty much, like,
knew it was 5150 already.
You know the streets talk,
like, you just hear stuff.
I mean, little by little you find out.
I was young.
I was just a kid when she passed away.
I was maybe 13 years old,
so at that time when that happened,
I didn't really know about gangs.
I talked to Aunt Belinda. I said,
"MySpace. I can go on there.
I can search for you."
"Get information for you."
I knew nothing about the social media.
I wasn't on the MySpace.
She said, "How do you do it?"
I said, "I can do it all. Don't worry."
I was 14.
About to turn 15.
If you've got a teenager at home,
chances are that he or she spends
a lot of time
on the social networking website
called MySpace.com.
I knew everything about it.
The ins and outs.
How to make it look like this,
how to make this pop up in your text,
how to make colored text, everything.
With 66 million users nationwide,
MySpace is one of the most popular
networking sites used by kids.
Most of the kids at my school use MySpace.
You put pictures up. Meet girls, guys.
It was brand-new, popular.
Everyone wanted to be on it.
I was obsessed with it.
I was excited.
You want to give me this chance?
You want to give me responsibility?
I thought to myself,
"How can I snoop better?"
So Jaimie
Googled a picture and found a pretty girl.
She had a Supergirl shirt on.
I was like,
"You're gonna be my Supergirl."
I  just wanted a pretty face,
a pretty body,
and it was gonna be my brain behind it.
And we named her Rebecca,
and we posted that up.
I made her
in the eyes of what I thought
the gang members would like.
Added in, "Smoke weed,
and I like to drink beer."
But I said cerveza
because I thought it was more clever.
I wanted them to 100% think,
"This girl on this MySpace is real."
I had the top eight.
I befriended all of them.
Clicked on that person's profile,
went to their top eight,
added all of their top eight.
You got clicked, and everyone
got clicked, and everyone got added,
and I just kept adding and adding
until I had a MySpace full of guys
that were 5150,
and it looked like I belonged.
I said, "Aunt Belinda, I got it set up.
What do you want me to do?"
"Get as much information as you can."
I was making them like me.
Just making them trust me.
They don't even
spell a word out.
I had to ask, I go,
"What does LOL mean?"
My typing was acting.
That's what my acting was.
Just trying to find out where
they were from, what they were doing.
Of course, I knew that they were driving
a white Ford Expedition that night.
She wanted me to start prying
for information real quick.
And I was like,
"No, no, no, I gotta play it out."
"Let me do this in, like, a week."
Give me three days at least
before I start being like,
"Hey, what car do you drive?"
Okay. He had the white Ford Expedition.
Yeah, two of them.
That even made it even more confusing too.
With the witnesses and everybody,
because the two vehicles the same color.
I… I remember at some point early on,
we talked about the vehicles in the area.
Okay, this one's Robbie.
Neighbors had seen
a couple of vehicles.
Some described them as SUVs,
like Expeditions
or something of that nature.
They were parked right here.
Doing laps in the area
almost as if they were chasing each other.
I remember asking them about that.
"You saw it? Know what happened?"
"You were getting in your cars
to go somewhere else
about the time that these vehicles
were speeding through the area."
And I can remember them
playing kind of dumb about it.
Yeah, there… there was a little bit. Um…
I didn't come forth with everything
that I knew right away.
Where was Robert
when this happened?
Robert? I don't know.
Robert had nothing to do with this.
Sure. Sure.
So you tell the story
of that night, you don't mention Robbie.
Oh, yeah,
because that had happened before,
but then that just kind of
went out the door.
I mean, I wasn't even thinking
about where Robbie went.
I went to go find Robbie.
And we were getting ready
to go to the store, and--
It turned out later on that
the older brother, Robert,
was actually one of the vehicles
being chased,
and they didn't offer that up
for quite a while.
So this whole thing starts with Robbie
parked almost directly across
from his parents' house,
talking to a friend.
I pulled up to his house,
and, um, my buddy came out.
He's just in the passenger window
talking to me.
And, uh, my girlfriend, she kind of got,
like, she had a look on her face.
And, uh,
there was an Expedition behind us.
And I looked at my buddy,
and he was kind of getting spooked,
and kind of backpedaling
back up to the house.
I did have an eerie feeling
like I don't know these people. I don't…
I don't have these problems
in life, man, you know? Um…
I turned on my brights,
and, uh, I just gunned it.
I thought I'd hit them or the curb,
like something was bound to go wrong.
And I slid around the corner.
And immediately they started chasing me.
You were not in an SUV that night?
- No.
- Absolutely not?
I can't tell you how many people
saw two SUVs that night.
Realize, Robert, that I am here
to help your family.
That's all our jobs.
I'm gone.
I don't think it's an issue.
Whatever it was, it's gone.
I head over towards
my daughter's mom's house.
And, uh, I get there, and I pull up,
and she's all hysterical.
I think we started doing
some follow-up on…
the family.
I learned that the Lane-Theobald family
had some issues back in the day.
People had been arrested, in prison.
My boys, you know, they're boys,
and they're going to have their problems,
and they like to fight,
and whatever they do.
Even with Belinda, uh,
there were drug issues in the past.
We've been in the drug world together.
Using. But I don't want to say all that.
Do you want me to say all that?
Well, you know,
it started out a little weekend fun,
but then became mama's little helper.
It was like that's how
you go to work and work two jobs,
and take care of five kids, and the house.
It was meth. Meth, the devil dope.
Go to work, take your line, you know?
Come home from work.
I mean, kids were always around,
but not seeing.
They weren't seeing that.
We weren't doing drugs
in front of the kids.
Uh…
They tried to hide it
as much as they could,
but it was super obvious.
Yeah, then, the bigger issue was
when I was selling drugs
and went to prison.
She's had dealings with the police
in the past for her own issues,
for her son's issues.
Yeah. Yeah. I… I sold a lot.
I did a lot of damage out there.
All of Riverside, I… I did.
I've put a lot of drugs on the streets.
A lot.
And all Crystal ever asked her,
all the time when she was younger,
was, "Mom, please, quit using.
Please, please, please."
So now the idea of who might
be responsible for this
opens up a little bit more.
That, is it something from somebody's
past issues in prison?
Is it somebody's past issues with gangs?
Is it somebody owed somebody money,
or drugs, or, you know,
all of a sudden now the world
of possibility opens up even further,
because there's this compromising
situation with the victim family.
Every day.
Get out of school, walk straight home.
Hours upon hours.
From three o'clock in the afternoon
till one o'clock in the morning,
I'd be on there.
I think it got harder for me
when my Aunt Belinda came up with the idea
of making Crystal a MySpace.
Rebecca just wasn't getting us enough hits
from the ones that we were interested in.
And so I asked her,
"Can you put Crystal's picture up there?"
I said, "Crystal. Why do you want
to make Crystal a MySpace?"
Make them fall in love with her.
We decided to name her Angel.
And I wrote on her profile
that I was going to be
their biggest life mistake
and their deepest, darkest,
best-kept secret.
And, boy, they just started responding.
It's like, boy, just left then right,
ping, ping, ping.
I'd be on there switching back and forth.
I'd have two pages open.
I would just minimize one, go to Angel,
minimize the other, go to Rebecca.
My Supergirl.
She wasn't making them fall in love.
She was more or less
a booty call, you know?
Crystal was the love.
Rebecca pried a lot, was nosy.
Like, "Oh, tell me this, tell me that."
It was very, very flirty.
And, like, teenager-y.
Like, "Oh, today was a shitty day."
Like, "Uh, school sucks."
Like, a little sad face and stuff.
Angel's was always upbeat and sweet.
She had good fonts. She had big fonts.
Little fonts, pink fonts,
blue fonts, sparkly fonts.
It wasn't long.
The profile had just barely been up
when William Sotelo responded.
He doesn't watch movies.
He watches porn.
He doesn't read books.
It was, "eff books."
And he's standing in his profile.
"I'm from 5150, and I'm down to kill."
So I just got tunnel vision on Sotelo.
I mainly talked to him.
He was very adamant about 5150 on MySpace.
Jaimie's putting in messages.
He's sending messages back.
"Well, what do you do
besides party and drink?"
I'm not really the party girl,
once in a while.
"No, no, no,
that's not my thing. I have goals."
"I'll show you. I'm gonna be somebody."
When you want someone
to want you, you play with them.
And I did what Crystal taught me to do,
um, make the boy come to you.
We told him, uh,
Angel's mom's in prison for cooking meth.
And I thought maybe that'd get them
to open up a bit about drugs or prison.
He came back opposite
of what I would've thought.
It got deep. It was like, "Wow."
His messages, he was getting more sweet.
How he wanted to give me the world
and make sure nothing else
got in the way of it.
I have this picture of Crystal in my head.
I really had to portray that.
I had to show him
she was a beautiful person.
She was hard not to fall in love with.
You'd meet her,
you'd fall in love with her.
Her personality, her smile.
It was hard not for that guy
to fall in love with her.
He said, "Hey, girl, I'm having
a party tonight. You want to come?"
"What's up? I'm ready tonight.
You don't have a car, I'll come get you."
We're like, no, no, no.
They wanna meet me. "What do I do?"
And she goes, "Well, well, tell him yes."
"And then send him a message,
like, at the very last minute."
"And say you can't make it."
And then, like, an hour later,
I was like, "Damn, I cannot find a ride."
He was so adamant about trying to get me
to come out that night.
It was more than he had ever tried before.
"Oh, girl. I'll come pick you up then."
So I was like, "Oh, so if you were
to come pick me up,
what car am I supposed to look for?"
That white truck, was there
anything that stood out about it?
Like, was it lowered, or have some kind
of special rims on it, anything at all?
It was an Expedition.
I don't know what make that is.
- Okay.
- If that's a Ford or what.
Belinda knew enough that I was looking
for a particular kind of vehicle.
An Expedition.
It was a white color, but it also had
some gold accent here and there.
And I was looking for the 5150
gang member who had that car.
I went ahead and called Detective Wheeler
and told him,
"Look, this is what I found out,
and I think we found him."
"This is who they are."
I remember her calling me saying,
"Jokes. It was his car."
"Jokes drove that car. It was him."
That's also where the MySpace account
started to come into play. Um…
At the beginning, I told her,
"I wish you would've told me
you were starting this."
"So I would've known ahead of time."
But, uh, rolling through the comments
from these various guys
that were just
head over heels for this girl.
I mean, they…
A pretty lady, a pretty girl,
and her talking to them
the way that, that she was.
It was no wonder they got lured in.
It's a great way to set it up.
So my next thought is, I got to get a hold
of William Sotelo, Jokes.
If he in fact is the driver, he should be
able to tell me who else was in the car.
He should be able to tell me
who the shooter is.
Okay. All right, Will.
We'll get you right back here
once we're all finished up.
He was in the Job Corps.
You're doing your GED.
I know what that means.
-What are you doing as far as the cooking?
- Pantry cook.
He was supposedly studying to be a chef.
That's cool, man.
That's better than what you were doing.
- Yeah.
- Big time.
We talked all the way back
from San Bernardino to Riverside.
All right. You wanted a water?
See if you can get one for him?
-Sorry about that.
- No problem.
Your name has popped up
in a case that I'm working. Okay?
-Case?
- Yeah.
In an investigation that I'm doing.
What is it? Gang members, or…?
Well, it's got to do with 5150.
There's a girl that got shot.
-Girl?
- Mm-hm.
The thing that I need to ask you about,
though, is your… your car.
Your Ford Expedition
was identified as being there.
Was it mine?
With the license plates? I don't know.
Yeah, your car was there.
-Uh-huh.
- And…
-When was this?
- Back in February.
-Back in February?
- Mm-hm.
I don't know.
Yeah, you do, man.
When he would give me
things that were denials
or, um, he'd refute evidence I had,
I would just keep pushing him back into,
"It's not a question of whether
you were there. I know you were there."
"I want to know why."
Nobody else in 5150 or anyone else
in that area drives that car but you.
Every time I talk about Jokes,
it's always that car.
-Jokes? Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. That's you.
Now is the time that you really need
to be straight up with me
because I am your only ally right now.
I think after a while that wore him down.
The problem is if you sit and tell me,
"I wasn't there…"
All right, like, I'll say the truth, but--
That's what I want you to tell me.
The truth.
I wasn't involved in it. It just happened.
Tell me. Tell me what happened.
I don't know.
We were just cruising.
Like, driving around by Rutland.
Rutland Park?
Is that 5150 territory,
or isn't that close to MD territory?
Yes, that's MD's territory.
And everybody's piled
into your Expedition?
It was full,
probably like seven people in the car.
This white Expedition passed quick,
almost hit my truck.
He cuts us off, like, whoosh.
Almost, like,
this close to hitting the truck.
"This is where we were
when we saw the SUV Robert was driving."
"This is where we stopped
when the cars drove up on us."
And then they started…
The… The white Expedition
started shooting at the car, at my truck.
- They shot at your truck?
- Yeah.
I was gonna take off,
and Lil Huero's like, "Just stop."
-He got out.
- Okay.
So Little Huero gets out, right?
Where did he walk to?
Did he walk to--?
I don't know. I started ducking.
There was bullets everywhere.
That's pretty ballsy to get out
if somebody is shooting at you.
Pretty ballsy to get out of the car.
He's crazy. He's psycho. It's weird.
What did you see in the car
with the girl inside when it went by?
-I don't know.
-Did it look like it got hit?
-It did.
- It have bullet holes in it?
No, like the window was shattered.
Which window?
The front… The front,
like, um, passenger side.
Okay.
And you said you were getting shot at?
Did your car get hit?
No. Um, I don't think it got hit.
That's close for them not to hit you.
-I'd have thought you've been hit.
-I don't know.
And we had no bullet strikes
in William's SUV, no shell casings,
no weapons that were found
within the Theobald household.
And lacking that evidence,
I don't have anything to substantiate
that they were fired at
by the Theobald family.
Okay, when did you see Little Huero again?
I never saw him. I never heard from him
or saw him ever again.
- No?
-Mm-mm.
They had not had contact with him,
Julio Heredia.
They hadn't seen him. He wasn't out
doing the crimes that he'd been doing.
He was kind of a ghost.
So, Little Huero, Julio Heredia,
he's definitely looking
like a prime suspect.
I need to find him.
I need to get ahold of him.
Why don't we take a break?
Mind hanging out for a few minutes?
-Okay.
- Okay, be right back.
-Is this, like, all gonna stay here?
- What's that?
Is anybody else
going to find out about this?
- Am I gonna go run and tell?
-I don't wanna get killed.
I ain't gonna tell Little Huero about it.
I didn't have enough for an arrest
for William at that point.
And since everything was on
his willingness to help me out, legally,
I was going to have to let him go
at the end of it. Um…
because I promised him I would.
-San Bernadino or--?
-Could you drop me off at Parkview?
Parkview? I can do that.
But he was huge. Very big piece.
This is the matrix covering
the different people also at the homicide,
at the scene when it happened.
Um, this is William Lemus Junior,
and his nickname was Little Rascal.
And his brother Manuel.
Manuel's nickname was Tripper.
I felt like it was just bullshit.
At school,
gangs were aiming for little kids,
to take them in when they were little.
I wasn't with it.
I told them, "They're too young."
And they looked at me and said,
"How do you think we got you in?"
I went to their house party,
and I liked everything that they did.
And that house was full of people.
Loud music playing.
But at that moment, I felt like
this is where I wanted to be.
Next thing you know, I got a guy
in a bike coming up to me.
I remember beginning of school year,
somebody said that the guy on the bike
is the one that shoots you.
Julio.
He's like, "Right on. Give him a beer."
I don't drink.
"Do you want to be in, or no?"
"Yeah."
"Get him some weed."
"I don't smoke."
"You want to be in? Do this.
You want to be in? Do that."
Puts up his hand and said, "Get him."
Cut that shit.
One of the kids grabbed me,
tackled me to the floor,
speared me to the floor down.
And then, like, you're in.
And they just started hugging me,
holding me.
"We'll get your back
whenever anything happens."
Next thing in school,
they want me to hang out with them.
They want me to be around their table.
And then I was like,
"Hey, I'm making it in now."
The way I felt was,
"Why should I be scared?"
"Shouldn't I feel safe?"
Have that feeling
that no one will come after me.
I'm with the ones that come after people.
We lived very peacefully there.
Very peacefully.
There were never any problems,
nothing, nothing.
All those guys were his friends because
they were all from the same neighborhood.
They were his friends.
They seemed so innocent.
They showed me respect.
They didn't use bad language.
And I had no idea
what a big problem that was.
It wasn't done yet.
That's why I stayed on for so long.
That's why I never got off
because I still had a lot more to do.
I really tried to be Crystal.
Making someone fall in love with someone
who's dead is not a good feeling inside.
When I was messaging as Angel…
pretending to be her,
I was really, really keeping her alive
in my heart.
I was with her again all night long.
Staying up late.
I think that's what made it
difficult at the end.
It just… It felt like I was…
stuck pretending to be her.
She wasn't here anymore.
It was hard to look at her face every day.
That's when the MySpace
got hard for me.
I told my Aunt Belinda,
I said I was done.
I couldn't do it anymore.
Oh, yeah, I was so… I was very depressed,
very depressed. Uh…
I said,
"Why isn't William Sotelo in custody?"
After they find out everything,
and he admits to it.
Everything has a breaking point,
sooner or later.
Like a jar, all this stuff going in.
There's no release valve.
It just keeps going in,
and the jar is starting to crack.
And stuff's starting to come out
with nowhere to go.
I understand how the streets work.
You want to handle this.
Your brothers want to handle this shit.
-Enough harm's been done.
- Right.
You don't need to go back to jail.
Your brothers don't need to.
Your mom doesn't need
this kind of anguish, so…
I know her boys weren't exactly
interested in us
bringing the resolution about.
They were used
to handling things their way.
And that wasn't going to be good
for anybody.
Are your sons, uh, wanting
to take care of this themselves?
- No.
- No? Okay. Good.
Yeah, we don't… We don't need that.
Only because of a promise to my mother
did we not pursue
what we felt we wanted to.
Okay, everybody, no violence.
Not in my daughter's name.
But in the back of my own mind,
I still knew I was going to kill him.
And so I took over the site then
because after so many months,
you begin to wonder,
"My God, are they ever going to get him?"
And I just go into the zone
with this anger.
Everything I could learn
about their family.
Everything I could learn about them.
Riverside High School.
I started getting a little braver.
And I'd drive past their houses
and go take pictures of the vehicles,
the license plate numbers.
I called the FBI and ICE.
I was trying to get them all deported.
If there was a problem
I could bring to one of them, I would.
Looked at some of their religious effects.
Santería.
Dropped a couple things off in their yard.
Black candles, and that little
voodoo doll that came from Spencer's
with a million pins in it.
Belinda was just kind of, uh,
psycho, you know?
In her own little world. And, uh…
loved her to death because she's…
You know, but she can be crazy.
I befriended
some Casa Blanca gang members.
I went on there and told them,
"William Sotelo is talking
a gang a shit about you.
He says you motherfuckers are pussies."
And pissing them off.
They're like,
"Oh, you wanna bang on the MySpace?"
Bangin' on the mic and shit, MySpace…
I'm like,
"Bitch, you want to come see me?"
"Take the 91 Freeway."
"Exit at La Sierra. Turn right."
"And I drive
the white Ford Expedition, bitch."
She went on a bit of a tirade
with that MySpace account.
What we did was great,
but this is gonna screw stuff up
if now, you start threatening them,
start doing things
that will draw any kind
of sympathy on their part.
Detective Wheeler came and said,
"There's been an exceptionally large
number of white Ford Expeditions
that are being shot up
and burned up and vandalized."
I just don't want there to be
any loose cannons out there
that can throw a wrench in everything.
He goes, "I think you need
to knock off all your bullshit."
"And stay off the Internet,
and let us do our job."
And I'm like, "Okay. Yeah, right.
Sounds good."
Sounds like I'm getting somewhere
with something,
Last thing I was going to do is back off.
Then it was around April 20th,
four, 20, the penal code for marijuana.
And they were all up there. "Happy 4/20."
"Smoking a big one,"
and, "We're all partying." You know?
And then I got to thinking, party.
I started sending bulletins out
saying Angel's having an End of the World
party on 6/6/06,
and I'm not gonna tell you
where the party's gonna be
till six o'clock that night.
I remember her telling me
about the 5150 gang,
and that she was portraying
somebody else to lure one of the guys.
She was having this party.
Something about some party.
Out there through Perris,
there's a road called Ryder Road.
Here's where the story gets even trippier.
Someplace where I can see them
coming in, but they not see me.
And I just… Yeah.
She says,
"You won't believe what I'm doing."
And I said what I was scared more of.
I go, "I know this is what you want to do,
but I thought it was insane."
Who was gonna do the shooting?
Oh, I was gonna shoot them.
I was gonna… That was mine.
They were mine.
I was gonna shoot them myself.
Yeah, I had a plan, and I had a gun.
- Are you a good shot?
-I wasn't gonna be that far.
Just have him pull in
and just up on the top,
and figure we'd get the drop on them.
You know?
And it was gonna be
the end of their world.
I remember coming home, and, uh…
yeah, she was headed out.
She was determined.
Regardless what it was,
it was gonna make her feel better.
And that's what she wanted, you know? Um…
My husband, my boys are like,
"Mom, you need to back off."
"You need to stop."
We weren't gonna let her act on it.
It was like we were gonna lose our mom,
you know?
I made a plan to go murder people.
I made a plan to go murder people.
Let that sink in a minute.
You're suicidal,
or you're homicidal, you're just…
You don't care, but you care too much.
It was just, uh, the day before.
I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm not gonna kill him.
But I was just at the computer,
and I was crying, crying, crying.
I wanted him to hurt
like we were hurting.
You're not talking to Angel.
This is the little girl you killed.
Apparently, you didn't even know
who you had killed
because none of you
recognized her picture.
Why'd you kill me?
I had dreams. I had hopes.
Why did… Why?
He didn't respond to that, no.
That's when I gave, uh,
the detective, uh, the MySpace.
I handed over the passwords and MySpace
to keep myself in check.
So Jokes, uh,
he just dropped off the face of the earth.
Nobody saw him anymore.
Nobody had any more contact with him.
Because we didn't have William
in custody at the time,
I needed somebody else to tell me
what took place in that car.
All right, so this is Wyburn,
epicenter for 5150 back in the day.
There was a street where there were
also two other gang members
that had been inside the car,
the Lemus brothers.
This house over here on my left,
that was the Lemus brothers' house.
So knowing that Jokes had named them
as being people in the car,
they were my next step,
since I couldn't find Julio.
There was a shooting.
I don't know if people
were shooting at you.
I don't know if you
were shooting somebody.
If I was involved in a shooting…
-I think they shot at us.
- …I would remember.
And he asked me again.
"We know everything."
"You're the only one that's not talking."
You told me you didn't know
and you weren't in the car.
Now I know that's all lies.
'Cause you're telling me
that my brother's over here,
then you let us talk a bit.
Then he's coming telling me,
"You gotta tell them this and this."
-"'Cause then he's gonna lock you up."
- He was being honest about it.
He didn't hide anything.
He said, "I was there."
He goes,
"Your brother is in the other room."
"And he told us everything."
- Is this the front of the car?
-Yeah. The front of the car.
Okay.
This is me. This is my brother.
We're the only ones in the back.
- You're in the very back?
-Yeah.
This is William Lemus, his drawing.
So you can see
he's talking about Jokes and Huero.
Jokes said,
"These people were in the car,"
William Lemus confirmed the same thing.
Stories were starting to look the same.
Vehicles were the same.
Shooter was the same.
He fired one kind of high,
and then he pointed at the car.
-Yeah.
-Bam, bam, bam, bam.
-And those hit the car.
-Those hit the car. Okay.
That's him. It's not me.
"We're going to bring him in here." Okay.
Let's see if we can talk with him.
They brought him in.
And right there, in that instant,
I wanted to lunge at him…
and just attack my brother.
The rules say, "You don't say anything."
- You're telling me the truth?
- They will kill him.
The other way, you're lying.
So you want to lie to me
in the middle of a murder investigation?
Roll the dice.
Or tell the truth,
and tell me what actually happened.
It doesn't get any more black and white.
I know I didn't kill anybody.
So, fine. Tell me what happened.
I was like, "It's okay.
You're not gonna get one word from me."
And they released us.
When they released us…
I looked at my brother, and I told him,
"I don't know what you just did."
I already knew the gang wants
to kill me and my brother.
Well, one day, or should I say one night…
5150 did a meeting.
They were talking and telling us,
"Hey, it was your brother, wasn't it?"
"I don't know. He wasn't in the same room.
He was in a different room."
"Why was he in a different room?
Why was he longer?
Why did you get out, and then
he got out right when you got out?"
"I don't know."
"What would you do
if I killed your brother?"
"Would you be okay with it?"
I looked at him and I was like…
"I would do exactly the same thing
you'd do if someone killed your brother."
So I made my choice right there and then.
I'm out.
And I just walked away.
I wanted my brother to be okay.
I went with my brother,
and we left to L.A.
Well, if they couldn't get us,
I knew they were gonna try to get
my mom and dad.
I told my mom and dad to get out of there.
Mom and Dad didn't listen.
Sir, what is your address, please?
3445 Glasgow.
A bunch of kids all dressed in black.
Maybe they weren't kids.
I couldn't tell, they were so far away.
Okay, and how many kids
are you talking about?
About ten, 12.
My husband called the police, and they
asked, "Are you going to stay there?"
"No, how can I stay here?" he said.
"We're leaving, send someone to check."
- What is your name?
- My name is William Lemus,
but I do not want to get involved in this.
You don't want the officer
to knock?
Of course not.
We were able to leave, we left.
But we did not know
what they were going to do.
I have a feeling
that if my mom would have not left,
they probably would've burned them alive.
All the sentimental things.
But since I am Christian, the Bible says,
"The thoughts of man
are not the same as those of God."
Is there such thing
as loyalty in this world?
It means nothing, actually.
All right, Manuel,
your dad said you wanna talk more?
-Yeah.
- Okay. To remind you…
When they tried to do something
to my mom and dad, I said,
"Okay, fine. Give me the detective.
I'll tell him anything he wants to hear."
Do you remember
more of what happened that night?
I can tell you the whole story now.
Okay.
The beginning was that, my friends,
I don't know about what time,
late at night,
they came knocking at our house.
So it's nighttime.
I'm in an SUV.
A car pulls up.
One of the guys gets out
of the car like, "Hey."
"They tried to kill me."
"And tried to shoot me
with my daughter in the car."
It's a big SUV, big truck or something.
It was MD.
Another gang.
Julio, he was determined to do something.
Fuck them.
We're taking them out right now.
They had shown up in the area
of Greenpoint and Geranium
looking to retaliate against
a rival gang that they thought
had shot at one of their
gang members earlier in the day.
They didn't know who the Theobalds were.
They didn't have any connection with them.
But they run into Robert's SUV.
They see him.
I don't know what happened.
I was in the SUV sitting there.
We're parked right here,
and he's facing us right here.
And when Robert takes off,
they chase him.
And it's at that point that they lose him
and stop at the intersection
of Greenpoint and Geranium.
Two vehicles drive up
to their car that has stopped
almost in the middle of the intersection.
And they thought that this was rival
gang members coming to attack them.
Julio gets out of the SUV,
and walks in the middle of the road.
By that moment,
he's pulling out his piece
and just fired away.
The one round that struck Crystal
caught her in the back of the head,
kind of just around the neckline.
And, um, that would've been
one of the final rounds that was fired
as the vehicle's leaving the area.
And then four blocks ahead,
we see it pull over.
We already knew someone got hit.
- Out, like outside?
- Yeah.
-Lil Huero.
- Just Lil Huero?
-Just him.
- Okay.
I developed a rapport
with William Lemus and Manuel,
to where I feel like they trusted
that I had their best interests at heart.
I stood up, and I turned around
so he could see from behind.
I wasn't wearing a wire.
And they could be
my very key witnesses in this case.
He'd be on the passenger side,
but in the seat behind.
That pushed
everything into the area
that this will end up in a courtroom.
Somebody's gonna be held responsible.
Police Department! Search warrant!
We ended up doing a large gang
sweep with a whole bunch of agencies.
Police carried out 
gang association search warrants.
Somewhere in the neighborhood of 25
to 30 houses were hit all at the same time
on a particular morning.
"This was a reign of terror,"
said the D.A.
"I think we took the gang apart
on Wednesday."
The guys that were working
the intel for Julio Heredia
called and said,
"We've got a line on where he's at."
Julio woke up one day
surrounded with cops.
And they were Mexican cops.
I'm wanting to say it was within a day.
I think we got him up here.
Today we take back our park,
our streets, our neighborhood,
and a part of our community
and return it to the rightful owners.
There's no justice.
Justice would be
if they could find a way
to bring Crystal back to us.
News vans rolled up.
I was just, like, wow.
Her engagement
on social media gleaned information
that eventually helped
lead police to arrests.
We were notified the night before
that Julio Heredia had been charged
with my daughter's murder,
and that he was in custody.
It was like, "Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you. They got him. They got him."
You're looking at a murder charge,
and you're that…
Are you that confident?
I'm looking at you.
I can tell you're not confident.
No, I'm sure about this.
I'm thinking about other things.
What are you thinking about? Anna?
-That kid she's carrying?
-Yup.
There's a lot of stuff
in your life right now.
How far along is she now?
-Four months.
- Four months?
-Little boy or little girl? Do you know?
-No.
How is she doing?
She's good.
You got a four-month-old on the way.
Set the example and step up
and be a man about this.
You made a mistake.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Some of them are bigger than others.
But right here, right now is the chance
for you to make a change.
For you to be a different kind
of a person, Julio.
You want to sleep on it tonight?
No, I just want to…
Yeah, I want a freaking lawyer.
I want you to give me my rights.
I want somebody to be right here.
Now you want a lawyer?
You can have an attorney if you want.
You wanna do that? That's fine.
-But now you got a lot to think about.
-You don't understand me anyways.
I would describe Riverside
as kind of the Wild West
of the criminal justice system
as far as here in Southern California.
An intense place to practice.
The DA's office, they have a reputation.
You know,
we're aggressive about gang prosecutions.
So aggressive to the fact we're looking
to put gang members to death.
You know,
on our side we're representing Julio,
and trying to convey his humanity
and his interests,
but they have to have a tough decision
to a family who's lost somebody.
Now we bring the family in,
and we talk with the DA's office
about if it'll be the death penalty.
I know Belinda was very, very passionate.
She wanted him to pay
the ultimate price for it.
Um, and I don't blame her.
I don't blame her at all.
Yeah, I hate him. I hate him.
I do.
There's… I can't think of anything
in the world bad enough
that would be enough.
Capital cases, your whole mind frame
is changed to saving a person's life.
So that person's entire life
has to be investigated
because ultimately,
you're not just killing
that part of the person that committed
the crime. You're killing all of them.
Their story has to be told.
How they got to where they were.
You know, not excuses but explanations.
He was so small in this picture.
He was so tiny.
His big, old ears.
I remember them sending us out.
The papers that we have to fill out,
like if you're 18 and older,
and if you want to go
to the execution, you can.
Oh, my mom.
It was hard living with my mom.
You know, she was on drugs
and alcohol, and…
I mean, I would pick stuff
up off the floor, eating it
'cause we were so hungry.
So that brings… Seeing this picture
brings back a lot of bad memories.
Uh…
We didn't have food.
We didn't have furniture.
Julio, he had to take care
of all of us, getting money, working.
For me, the only father figure
I ever had was Julio.
You know, with Julio,
we looked up to him.
We wanted to be like him.
We would dress like him.
You know, we were proud.
We would go to school, and we'd tell
everybody, "That's our cousin."
This is where we lived up here,
and he lived over there across the street.
That was his last spot where, like,
he actually, like, lived with his mom.
Uh, Julio was 14, 15, then.
I think he couldn't accept that his mom
just didn't care to get them back.
You know, she didn't try to get them back.
See, this picture just reminds me,
like, of when they started,
you know, going out
and getting involved in all that stuff.
He started hanging out
with the older guys.
And those are guys who would let him
in his house. And they gave him drugs.
And, you know, uh,
they started having him do things
that he shouldn't have been doing.
Oh, this has everybody in it.
They all look so young in this picture.
This guy stabbed him
with this huge kitchen knife.
And Julio's skinny,
so the knife, like, came out his back.
That's when I started realizing
he wasn't, um, the same anymore.
Like, his joy was gone.
It was, like, done, dead.
Nick even said,
"Mom, I don't like this fucker."
He goes, "Yeah, I fucking don't like him."
"But, Mom, you got to think,
when I was 17, I didn't give a fuck."
I was into sports.
I mean, playing football
and going to ride my dirt bike.
And after Crystal was killed, I started
having problems at school with fighting,
in a bad mood, and mad at the world,
I guess I could say.
And he started messing up.
He was angry. He wanted revenge.
And we were losing him to a gang.
- Which son?
-Nicholas.
Yeah, like, I was from a gang, and
we were enemies with the 5150s and stuff.
I just fit in right with them.
Like, fuck them fools too, you know?
Like let's go look for them and…
Now I have the fear and worry
about my son being killed in gang violence
and being a part of a gang,
or killing somebody.
When I was a juvenile,
I was arrested a lot.
I mean, I have the gun case,
then I'm up for assault with a firearm.
That's what I got out of prison for,
and it's just not worth it.
You stay in denial a little bit.
You don't wanna believe that your child…
could do something like that. Get a gun.
I'm like, "How did you get a gun?
Where did you get a gun?"
This was my bottom.
This…
This was Belinda's wake-up call.
I had to really start taking
a good look at myself,
and why I was having
all of these… these feelings,
and just being pissed off at the world.
And…
where is the anger coming from?
What… What is it I'm mad at?
Well, I was mad at me. I was mad at me.
I was disappointed in me.
Who's that? You guys, get down!
I think they're coming up the road again.
Get behind the car, Ben. Hurry!
Wait. Ma'am, hold on.
Do you think he was a teenager?
The last day I used
was the day Crystal was murdered.
Yeah. I was high.
-He was shorter than me.
- Thin, medium, heavy build?
Uh. He… uh… Very…
Oh gosh, uh…
And that's all Crystal
ever wanted from me.
"Mom, just get sober."
My heart's still pounding. I'm just like,
"Oh my God. I can't believe this."
And I couldn't do it for her.
I couldn't do it for her in life.
I have to learn to forgive myself.
And that's harder than forgiving…
Julio Heredia.
It really is.
I had to say that.
Just memorials
of all the murders in Riverside County.
Every single day,
it's on the news.
It's just the names are changing.
I can understand where the drugs, gangs,
and they were all high
as a kite that night too.
I can actually say, "There go I,
but for the grace of God."
That was really the reason
that we asked him
to take the death penalty off the table.
I did the right thing
for the first time in my life.
I did the right thing. Yeah.
If you've got gang members
that are definitely loyal to their gang
and know the price
that they pay if they snitch,
it's pretty rare that you get one,
maybe two to be cooperative with us.
So that was huge.
By the time he hears the gunshot,
he comes outside of the car.
He's coming out.
And at this time,
I hear several other gunshot noises.
I was kind of scared
because of the fact that…
I know how many people
are in this organization.
And it's not something that you end.
You've seen Little Huero on meth?
- Yeah.
- You've never smoked with him?
Never smoked with him,
never seen him do it,
but I know he's on it,
his eyeballs are all opened up.
It was just crazy to see them testifying
against my brother, you know?
'Cause they grew up with us, you know?
They were always there.
They were always at our house.
So I saw when Little Huero
dumped the first shot.
I didn't see the other shots.
I saw the first one.
I did feel hurt, you know?
Because we would hang out every day,
and I just thought,
for you to make up lies
just to get out of something.
Did you have interactions
with them? Did they talk to you?
Not at all. They were just looking at me,
but I didn't want to look at them.
I think it was Manuel's crying, um,
when he was testifying, so…
I know he didn't mean
to do all those things he did.
Like how everyone
in this world doesn't mean to do it.
The comments
that the judge made were really harsh.
"Mr. Heredia is not a good person."
"He is a violent, cold-blooded murderer."
"And he is going to pay
for what he has done."
Um…
We lived in the fast lane.
We did things
that you can't even think of.
For those things, we get nightmares.
I live it every day. I can't…
drive down the street where I grew up…
without flashing back.
I've had dreams about her, just…
I just hold tight to all my memories.
It was about a month ago.
Crystal was standing there.
And she was in this white dress.
And then I woke up.
Now it's going to be difficult
forgiving myself.
Mom and Dad always try to protect me,
always try to have something good for me.
And I'm…
I'm trying not to let them down again.
I want to have kids.
Raise a family.
You know, do something.
It was personal between
William Sotelo and I.
It's not over until he's apprehended.
And I feel like I just need him
in custody so Crystal can rest.
Let's see what William Sotelo…
Mm…
Oh, and Unity.
It shows me that wherever he is,
he's not doing too badly.
This is beautiful. The High Priestess.
Now this would represent me.
And it shows that I'm wise enough
to take the steps
to move forward in my life.
And I'm to listen to my intuition
and have patience
and consider carefully
what I want before I act.
And then the Justice card.
He's ours.
They're going to get him one day.
Better times are coming.
Yes.
Justice and revenge.
Yes, they are just about the same thing.
One means you can stay in the free world,
and the other means
you can go sit in the defendant's chair.
And that's a line I almost crossed myself.
