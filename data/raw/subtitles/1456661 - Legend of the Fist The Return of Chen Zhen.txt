Legend of Chen Zhen
Europe. France 1917
The frontline is dangerous, we need 10 more people now...
No more ammo!
Move it, quick.
Tiansheng, dont be scared.
Calm down, calm down.
We will make it back to China...we can't die here.
Everyone don't be scared, continue forward
Do not go back, march forward.
My lucky charm.
It will protect you.
Brothers, let's move forward.
Lets go!
Lets go!
Quickly!
Commander, ammo is here.
Why are the French retreating?
Chen Zhen...
Help me.
Chen Zhen!
Germans are here, damn it.
Everyone alright? anyone hurt?
Chen Zhen, lucky to have you here.
Brother Chen, I'm okay.
Thanks to your lucky charm.
Thank heaven, thank god.
I must go home.
Tiansheng...
I must go home.
I'll kill all of you!
I must go home.
Everyone get down.
We cannot die here.
Mr. Liu!
Thank you.
- Owner Liu, business is good huh?.
- You guys please enjoy.
Boss, look, every night it's like this.
Who would believe there's a war going on.
It's crazy out there,
they dont come here, then where else?
Everyone, my brother says he has war news from the front.
He says, General Zhou will defeat Commander Zeng.
There's news that Commander Zeng retreated.
If General Zhou wins, China will be unified.
Not for sure yet.
The British, Japanese are still behind Commander Zeng
Both do not wish China to be unified.
Are you kidding?
You've been to Taiwan?
Japan invaded Taiwan.
You fight back, and get terminated.
You still want to fight back?
History books won't even record your name.
If this continues, Taiwan will become Japan
Also, China is not under Chinese control
Eventually, I think either the Brits or Japanese will win.
Don't forget
More chaos here, more prosperity for us.
Tell her to sing this song.
Kiki, sing us a Japanese song.
Kiki.
Come on, lets go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Very good, very nice.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Who do you want?
Officers, dont be angry.
Everyone's my guest today, please save this Lu some face
Sit, sit
- Ah Wan
- Yes
I am sorry. Please sit down.
I can't take this, Mr. Liu
Brother, you returned from France?
Correct.
Have a drink.
Thank you Mr. Liu.
Let me ask something...pair is big or three of a kind?
What are you holding?
Three of a kind.
My pair beats your three of a kind.
Come on.
Okay, continue.
Winner winner, chicken dinner
I won
Again
Tiansheng, taking big risk?
Risking my life is okay?
Your Life? How much is it worth?
Not cheaper than yours!
What did you say?
Your life, is it worth this much?
Then my life is yours now.
Who is scared of who?
Three of a kind.
It's over for you.
Two Pair.
Pair can beat three of a kind?
Didn't someone say that moments ago?
You...
Correct?
Sit down...
Okay.
Rules are made by you guys.
Can't take it when someone wins?
Okay.
My brother.
You gave me your money, or your life?
Of course, I need money not life, Mr. Liu.
Okay then.
Drink.
Come on, continue
Drink too much these couple days.
Cant drink anymore, I have to go back to the hotel
Don't stay in the hotel anymore
move in here
Don't be a stranger
Don't mention it
Okay, Thank you Mr. Lu.
You're here?
Didn't you say this room's for me to watch the sunrise?
It's only 3... no sunrise yet
Let me introduce my brother, Qin Tiansheng.
This is Kiki.
Then now you got more brothers than wives
What am I to do?
You are married to me, you should know what to do
What about other mistresses?
They're one night stands, you're my main chick
When they are all gone, we can continue this talk
Have a drink!
- Next time perhaps
I drank a lot tonight, thanks Miss
He drank a lot, let me.
Then I won't bother you two
I'll go first
Ah Wan's downstairs, he'll see you out.
Thank you.
Your girlfriend's cold.
You interested?
If you have it, take it. I'm afraid you can't control yourself
That's you, Mr. Liu.
Really?
Good night
Thank you Mr. Liu.
You are welcome.
You hang out with Liu Yiutian now?
If so, you'll be famous
This keeps up, then it will be too dangerous
This is small part of the plan
No, getting close to Liu Yiutian is a big part already
He can't trust you that quickly
Be careful
Liu Yiutian, this person...
you think he can do big things?
Also... he has ties to the underground
After all, he is still Chinese
Our force is not strong enough...
...to face the Japanese
We must encourage every single Chinese
The more power Liu Yiutian has, the more valuable
Thus, if we and the underground...
established ties...
It will be beneficial to us.
I contacted some sailor brothers from France for help
Don't worry
Don't forget our school mates
Every Chinese is together on this
But our country cannot be unified
At least, for now..
I believe we can do it. We can.
Master, why did you start Jing Wu School?
To protect the homeland, Chen Zhen.
France. 1917.
Tian Yuan, we almost made it to China.
You stay here and rest.
Tian Yuan will go back to China with us.
Chen Zhen can't go home now.
But Qin Tiansheng can.
China's Battlefield.
I got news from France.
England intercepted news about our troop movement
Besides me, only 3 of you know.
Who made the mistake?
Sir, I never left base.
You all listen...
Japanese soldier, must have courage
Yes.
Sisters, boss is here
Now, bottoms up!
Whose birthday is it?
Whose birthday is not important.
It's important that you invite us for a drink
Okay, let's drink
Ah Chi.
Your boss has ways with the ladies.
He is very wealthy in Shanghai.
Wearing white is Wei Wei.
You, come here!
I have to go now...
General Zeng's lover...keep eyes on her.
He's here!
Not at the battlefield?
He's back, at Duy Quinh Place
Told me to come over
Shall I call a car for you?
No need. He sent a driver
He will pick me up
Drink one, then go
Give her one shot
Hong Lan
Any left?
Sorry sister Kiki, I just sold out.
I'll go buy one for you, okay?
Okay
Mr. Qin, see you.
Lady Duy, General is waiting upstairs.
Okay
Sir, we have located General Zhou and General Zeng of the NE army
My people are ready, waiting for your orders
General Zhou, hello!
Arrived? Hello!
Long time, sit sit
It's cold outside, lets eat hot pot
We just talking nonsense to relax
General Zeng
Tell me, your troops against mine... who will win?
You'd win
What if the Japanese help you
If so, I would surrender
I only use the Japanese
They are a bunch of bastards
The Japanese won't give you the time.
Things are critical now
Some already moved to Europe.
Honestly, I don't want to fight the NE army.
But, your army can't be helping the China government.
To be direct
If you withdraw, the army is still yours
I'll stop fighting immediately
What do you think?
Brother Zhou, don't force me.
This reply, is what you want to say to all of China?
General Zhou
General Zeng, forgive me for not seeing things
He trusts you...admires you
Won't you believe in him?
Let me tell you
If he doesn't want to be Japan's dog...
Then he has only got one option
Negotiation
Brother, it's not easy, to get to where China is today
Victory is in sight
Brother Zhou, I need time to tell everyone
Give me 7 days
Okay
7 days is okay
If...
If they don't listen...
Next time we meet, it will be on the battlefield!
We two, will always be brothers
Bottoms up!
Give me some money
Easy, give me some money
Get lost!
Your majesty!
Thank you
Protect the General!
Protect the General!
One more skilled fighter
1,2,3,4
5,6
Who is driving that fast? Even the police don't drive THAT fast
Do I know who?
Let's go see
Who? Me?
Is it me every time? Hurry and go!
You go!
Me?
Come here, come here
Make way!
Useless fellow...
Search the crime scene, see who's alive
Go look over there, okay
Go and get killed
Who are you?
You need not know
You. Why did you save me?
I didn't want to save you. I had no choice!
I want to say one thing to you.
"Don't work with the Japanese!"
Don't dig your own grave!
Did General Zhou send him?
No, he isn't that type of person
Then who else knows you're back?
Your Majesty, my men practise day and night
Why want to assassinate his son?
I'm not interested in helping you handle this Zhou, he's not worth much
He only commands the NE army
Only the NE army, what can they do?
What is important, is what Tokyo wants
Only to see China surrender...
To us, that's beneficial
When General Zeng dies
War between General Zeng and Zhou can't be avoided
Just that we messed up
Can't believe a pro fighter appeared
We don't need to dwell on this
Right now what's important is...find out who he is!
Hurry and investigate
A person appeared to fight the mighty Japan!
Let us unite!
Many characters is good for us
We will help with all we got
Read all about it!
Read all about it!
Mysterious man appears to fight back Japan!
How Tai, don't wear black clothes all day
Wanna scare people to death?
Talking about me?
Then who else?
Can you guys guess who this mysterious guy?
I know who he is!
You sound confident, are you?
He didn't escape from the psychiatric ward
This person is here among us
Why are you so sure?
All of Shanghai knows.
I know everything going on in that ward!
You better be careful, maybe you are tired.
Head of a psy ward, scared of someone with a brain?
Maybe...
What happened last night?
You stupid chink!
Where were you yesterday?
You cant believe the news, that's no truth in the paper
Do you know what happened? Who is the mysterious guy?
General
That is weird. We received the same news.
We came to the scene right away
We got there, bodies everywhere
There's 17,18...
Bodies everywhere...
Over there 10...
Who knows, guns started firing
You were holding me!
When we were behind the car, We fired back!
Then we split up...
I'm on the right, he's on the left
I kept firing till I'm out...
Then what?
Out of bullets, at a moment like this...
I jumped from the hood of the car...
Then I jumped to the other side!
I thought I was dead meat...
But I got over in one jump
You think I'm a pig?
Listen to me!
Working too openly is not wise
I think if I pulled the hat down...
Nobody would notice me!
I'm a bad-ass, isn't that right?
You think you are that mysterious guy?
Look at yourself!
You look like a pig!
You stupid chink!
not Chink, it's Chinese.
Whatever, you stupid Chink!
Here's the money...
This is good...
I can go eat with the superiors
Yes, brother, we're here...
Every month it's gonna be like that
Stop staring, you want one too?
Luckily, you're not here yesterday
If not, dressing like this is scary as heck
Don't joke, I have a gun...
GUN
Then why didn't you appear earlier yesterday?
Am I not looking for the right opportunity?
- What did you find out?
- I investigated it all
None of the dead guys had any records
Let me ask you, who's at that bottom of this
I don't know
How are you gonna find a suspect from the dead bodies?
General Zeng returned to Japan
And Wei Wei?
But yesterday, General Zeng was courageous
Preparation is being done at the restaurant
Money?
Next time be careful. Don't drag me in again
Any one suspicious lately?
One new shareholder appeared
ery suspicious individual
Continue
His name is  Qin Tiansheng
Just back from France
Mr. Lu
Even invited him to be a shareholder of the night club
And you?
My mission is to stay close and retrieve intel from the British
But more people come in and out everyday
I'll pay more attention to this Tian Yuan
Sorry
Next time, don't come back with no intel
You better watch yourself
I'm sorry
Wei Wei
I thought I would never see everyone again
This is for you
It's perfume and cosmetics
Only sold in Shanghai
I have this
Thank you
Thank you everyone
Oh yeah
You told me to bring it
These bracelets...I keep 1, you keep 1
This is from your mom
You are my best friend
Alright, hurry, go go
Get me a box of cigarettes
Yes
Very nice to meet you
Sir

You dare mess at Mr. Lu place?
It wasn't me
Kiki, your cigarette
Excuse me
Bottoms up
We are ready
Mr. Lu, who's the guy with glasses
Him?
Businessman from England
High influence, up there with the English government
Quick with info too
Faster than you?
If it's about France, yes
I'm here
Don't go, come here.
Drink a little
Just got here, but stirring things up already...
I want a half day off
Off for what?
Me and him
Go out
You don't care right?
I dont mind
Let's go!
Kiki, where I want to go, you need not go
Cause you dare not take me?
This is the General, let's fight
Let's watch
Come here
Any more seats? Who is that?
Anybody else, no. For you, yes.
Brothers, look who's here
Brother, come here

Hello
Big Brother, this beautiful lady
Your wife?
Girlfriend!
Lady Kiki, hotpot is okay?
Of course!
Very good!
Let me ask...
What powers have you got.. to control big brother!
I dance at Casablanca night club ..
That's a hot job in Shanghai right now
You're the best!
Stop playing
Let's drink!
Big Brother, I wanna ask something
We're happy that you're here today
Let me make the first toast
Let us remember our fallen brothers as well
Let's drink to our good brother...
Chen Zhen
Alright, let's not talk about the past
Come on
Let's drink!
Zhi Shan?
Thank you
Kiki, hello
My sister.
- Your sister?
Why is it that you two don't look alike?
Of course we dont!
Cause I'm better looking!
Oh, you said Chen Zhen
The Chen Zhen that defeated Hong Khau ?
Yes
Wasn't he killed by the Japanese ?
He is still alive
There are a lot of rumors that year
But he definitely didn't get killed by the Japanese
He went through life and death with us...
...for 3 long years.
Chen Zhen is my good brother.
He is a good brother of ours, ain't that right?
Yes
It's the truth!
Though my eyes are small, I see very well
Chen Zhen is a bad ass
Really?
Yes, even Tu Dian is not as fast as him
Bottoms up...
Bottoms up!
Let's drink!
Lady Kiki
For you
Thank you!
I won't bother you two
Look like me?
It's good here...
Everyone's kind-hearted
No one is trying to deceive you...
or put on a front.
Living like this is nice
Yes
Stick, tiger, egg...
Tiger!
You lost
I let you win!
We've reached your home
Thank you
Thank you
Who are you?
I count to 3, I'll shoot if you don't tell me
One
Two
Three
You drank a lot
Too much
I'm going in
You carry a gun everyday?
Shanghai is a complicated place
Mr. Lu let us have them for protection
Handsome, let me have your signature
Signing is not needed, but you can keep it
Then it's my reward for the day
Thank you!
Who are you... really?
Your real name...
Feng Ching
Lady Feng Ching
The Japanese map must be completed quickly
Must deliver in 2 days
What the situation regarding the artifacts?
Here is the map of China's artifacts
Lots of valuable things
Okay, take as much as you can
Destroy anything you can't
Valuable sources like this...
...in the hands of China, is such a waste!
This country should be under Japan's control
Colonel, classified news from Japan
Killed this many?
To kill this many in 1 month
even using all of our manpower
it is not possible.
To achieve Japan's dream, We must do justice.
We just need extra effort
This list...
contains those who publicly oppose Japan
Cannot let it leak out
If not, Japan's killings would only increase
So England and U.S would do nothing?
When is Japan moving their troops here?
Any word from England and U.S?
No
When Japan set their troops here
They only want to benefit from  it
Don't forget, this country is victorious in war
But England, U.S, France
Let Japan have Taiwan island
Without any talk or consideration
Only seeing to their own benefits
Headlines!
Japan's assignations
Spark Radio reporting
List of Japanese assasinations
Killed for opposing...
Jack Taylor...
John Hanneke...
Robert Wendon...
Do Wen Chiu... He Chang... Ji Yong...
This has already happened
I want to know, what you guys are doing about it
Sit
We had a meeting this morning
We were expecting something like this
Following it very closely
Not a big deal
Don't just say it
I already know what you're gonna do
Talk to a superior?
Talking to your superior is useless
I'm trying to run a business, then this happens
Do you know how much my business...
would be damaged?
Now everyone is worried?
All customers are gone
What am I to do?
I want to know what you are doing about it
Go protect people on this list
...or find out who's behind this!
You are the law, so you must do it yourself
Don't depend on that Tien Sun Hei guy
Alright, I'm done talking
This is my good brother, Qin Tiansheng
This is Mr Huang
Chief Investigator right? Hello
I'm Huang Ciao Long
Boss, the Japanese are here
There seems to be a problem
Wait, wait miss pretty...
Please take a seat
They are here
Mr. Owner
Sun Qi Chin, hello...
Long time no see
Have a smoke
Where the girls?
Why are there no girls sitting here?
Sorry
Hurry
Mr. Lu, I'll see to it for you
You can see, but what can you do?
You dare kick him out?
Where are the girls?
Right away
Sorry
Get them here...what's with you?
The beautiful lady is here
Come over here
Please sit, sit
You help us translate a bit...
Okay, speak
Today, the ladies of Caca...
...all don't want to sit with these Japanese folks
People will die, if you say that Lady Kiki
Say it...
Say it!
She says she won't sit with Japanese!
What?
It's nothing!
Wait a minute!
Wait!
Sorry...Hold it. ..
How's it? I'm here
Let me!
Sit down!
Sorry, I'm Qi Tiansheng.
Nice to meet you!
You're Qi Tiansheng, the business partner of Owner Lu right?
Your info is good!
Let me serve you!
I'm not only good with info but also like to find things
This man in this picture is also Qin Tiansheng.
I lost this picture a long time ago.
Thank you
No need to thank me. It wasn't hard to find
What's hard is telling who's real and who's not
Mr. Qin, Do you know who the green hornet is?
I've heard about this "green hornet" movie..
Not a bad film really!
After this movie came out, the ticket offices are packed
You've seen this movie?
After the kill list came out, you think the Green Hornet would appear?
You say the Green Hornet, huh...
Give me a sec, let me think...
YES!
Then let us make a bet!
More people die, or more saved by the Green Hornet...
Okay?
what are we betting with?
A country!
Colonel Chikaraishi, great to have you here
what we betting? a country?
My business partner, you guys have met
Interesting guy!
Owner Lu, why accept Mr. Qin as new shareholder
But denied us in joining you?
This small business isn't fit for the Japanese
We want in!
Then you can open another one. Guaranteed that it'll be bigger than this place
You're not afraid of competition?
If your place is a success, we'll close down right away!
The Japanese release of this kill list...
besides Chinese, there's British, U.S, and French...What's your explanation?
This list is fake!
There's someone behind this trying to frame us!
Japanese troops are on the move. Are you guys invading China?
Does Japan want to start WWII?
My presence here at Casablanca is the best evidence!
Japanese and Chinese are good friends
Me and Owner Lu are good friends
We will never become enemies
I have to go. I'll come back when I have time
If you can, don't ever come back!
Mr. Li Tze Men, wait a sec!
I think you dropped this...
It's mine. Thank you.
Come to Japan sometime
Alright, next time.
Boss, it's alright now
Alright?
We just made enemies, and that's alright?
Yên
Expert Lam, go to Hong Kong and hide!
Okay, thank you ..
Feng Ting, I'll take you home..
Why is that?
You forgot you upset the Japanese?
There are lots of folks in Shanghai that upset the Japanese
How many can you protect?
As many as I can.
Careful!
Headlines!
Big Brother, tell the Hoa Chong brothers
Ready all our manpower! - Yes!
Combine with the students.
Fight back Japan!
Save our China!
Fight back Japan!
Save our China!
This is our China... How can I just leave?
Just because you say that, we cannot lose you!
It's only temporary leave
When it's safe, we'll bring you back
Who?
It's me, Hao.
Attacking the old and young, even me.
What did you do?
I told you to protect everyone
Protect the scholars and educated minds
I did follow your list of names
But those people...
...don't wanna leave, what can I do?
Threaten them!
You good at that, right?
What are you doing? Just go, go!
Don't push me! I won't push, just go!
You people don't have the right to do this
There're worse things...you wanna try it?
Get on, now!
From the General!
After you release this list, a lot of people ran away!
Then, doesn't that solve our problem?
Move aside..
Don't look!
Do not move!
3!
4!
5!
What are you guys doing? Why...
Listen up!
British, Americans, Germans must unite
We must show the Japanese who runs Shanghai!
Damn you Japs! Do you hear me!
You bastards!
How brave you are!
Ever think about leaving Shanghai?
It's not like I've never left Shanghai
This time's different, it's with me.
Go where?
Anywhere is fine
When Shanghai is less chaotic
I'll take you with me
Right now, you have a lot of things to resolve.
This world has lot of problems...
How you going to resolve them?
If everyone leaves just like you...
This place won't exist.
With no country, there's still a home
You're not afraid of death?
Everyone dies
it's important to die with meaning
Right?
When the ships dock, work with each other
Watch the spacing between ships
Now is when we show our nation's force
Going against China's army...
Number is not an issue..
We are for sure stronger!
Correct!
Then let's join together.
Don't you love to write? Keep writing!
Let's see how you write next time?
Chen Zhen..
Don't give up!
Boss, Chong from LuShan Times died!
So did the deputy editor...
Search again to be sure!
Your little brother died!
My good war brother taught me this piece
To save our country..
He was sacrificed in a battle with foreigners
Till this day..
The sacrifices continues...
Long live! Long live! Long live!
Japan's 80 planes bombarded the General's battlefield nonstop
Japanese ground troops at Honglong Giang blocks his retreat
Munitions are also destroyed ..
Let us unite, to defeat Japan
Fight Back against Japan!
Save our China!
These same old sayings, over and over!
These sayings are useless!
Just get the guns
Don't be rash!
To get ammo..
Right, that's it. Fight fast, win fast!
Cannot do this idea!
We can't just sit and wait
This time we must raise our flags!
Lady, your wine!
Thank you!
Sorry!
You got something to tell me?
1 sugar, 2 sugar..
No milk?
Why are you here at Casablanca?
I'm a dance girl..
So now you won't accept me
Wanna know this lowly girl origin?
You do not smoke, why tell Hong Lian to buy them?
I don't know what you're talking about
I really hope you can tell me that you don't work for the Japanese
Don't come back here again!
If you come back, I will kill you
Let me go!
No, don't hurt Kiki!
I am the General's girlfriend!
Anything you wanna say to him, he'll answer you guys
Don't throw Kiki into the water!
Do you guys understand what I'm saying?
Kiki, don't be scared!
They only want the General to listen to them
You know her?
You don't know her!
She's not Kiki, she's Sunko Yomei.
She is Japanese.
What do you want?
Thu Phe Yen has Yin Tze ..
I have her..
Both sides have the best spies
You cannot touch her, she's General Zeng's girl!
We can still use her..
She can be our hostage..
This is a lowly method... using a woman for blackmail
Do you think I'll do it?
This country needs an army to create confusion
General Zhou is against the idea of General Zeng working with us
So he sent someone to kill his wife
Sunko Yomei, it is YOU who will make this happen
Lt. Sunko Yomei, congratulations for accomplishing this
I will report to my chain of command in Tokyo!
Sorry to bother you!
I'm Huang Ciao Long from the police station
What do you want?
Im here to see Colonel Li Tze Men.
My wife.
Why so much?
Great, Chen Zhen calls us here, but he doesn't show up!
Alright, our plan depends on 3 main points
First, timing...
Since we are splitting up, we must arrive back at the same time!
Second, it's timing!
One extra second is one more danger
Third, it's still timing!
Here, hold it!
Hurry and go! what you doing here?
Come with us!
I've got it here, I'm the Chief Investigator
You're useless!
Continue!
Hurry!
Go!
Why is he here?
He is our country's enemy, that's why!
Every Chinese is our enemy!
How many can you imprison here?
What are you questioning him about?
Nothing.
Chen Zhen, you're being sloppy
Last year, you killed a man named Li Tze Chong.
That person is my father...
We Chinese are not the Sick Men of Asia
Sir! Something happened at headquarters
We Chinese are not the Sick Men of Asia!
Release him!
I still want a battle of life or death with you...
To revenge my father's death!
Hurry!
Japanese troops are here! Scram!
Hurry! Get out!
Over here, quickly!
Run!
Hurry, over here!
Hide over here!
Hurry! Get in!
Hurry!
Stop! Don't you run!
Idiot! Where did you place the bombs?
Fire! Put out the fire!
Chen Zhen the game ends now!
Mr. Qin!
Come and help!
Kill!
Don't worry, you're Chen Zhen's sister
How can I kill you?
Take her!
Move. Make way!
Move!
You watch here! You come here!
Get back, step back. There's nothing to see
My people wake up, wake up!
Fight back, save the homeland!
Save our country!
Disband Japan!
Our people wake up!
Our people wake up!
Save our country!
Special report, Shanghai Radio
The North Army attacked General Zhou...
heavy losses
30,000 casualties...
The NE Army is losing hope...
You're having a good sleep!
You're good!
With the situation like this out there,
you still can sleep
Now I think I'm the one running things
You're something else, just sleeping
But do you know what time it is now?
It's to the brink of disaster out there, Wake up!
I can't... I can't handle it all
Are you really Chen Zhen?  You need to wake up!
Fight Japan, Save country! Fight Japan, Save Country
Preserve our homeland! Preserve our homeland
Disband Japan! Disband Japan
My people wake up!
Protect our country!
Disband Japan!
Okay, okay..stop yelling
You noisy kids, what good does that do?
Go back, go back home!
That is Japan's Territory ahead...
I can't help you all if you cross that line
Who needs your help?
We don't need you patrol dogs to help!
Right! you all are Japan's lap dogs
You do not represent us Chinese!
Besides taking bribes, what else do you do?
Don't speak nonsense here!
You all, don't come near!
They fired!
Stop your fire!
Who fired?
Stop, stop your fire!
Stop, stop!
You won't control these students who started firing...
Now you tell me to let them go?
No, think about it, where did they get guns?
Must be someone else trying to start things
The students must be punished!
If not, how can I socialize with the Japanese?
You socialize with them?
Is this not English territory?
So useless!
You don't want to work here anymore?
Stay off!
This is China!
It's you that needs to get lost!
Let me tell you something, I can't stand you all pale pig skins...
Dancing around right in front of my face
I really want to tell your superiors
How much money do you take from us monthly?
Let's see who should get lost
Look at you! All day, you copy those dog foreigners
Without us, can you be so relaxed?
Without us, you can do nothing here!
You think you get to keep this job, for such a long time?
You still want to socialize with the Japanese?
Socialize my ass!
What? Something is wrong?
Can't understand me?
Then let me use English
You are useless!
Let me tell you, our country China has been here for thousands of years
Countless times, foreigners try to invade us
We give them only 2 words in the end,
"get lost"!
Yeah!
Let me free the students...
Whatever...
Awake, he's awake
Thank the stars! He is up
Brother Chen!
He's up, Doctor!
Hurry, come here!
Ting Hong, Fu Hai, Thong Man, Da Woh!
One by one right in front of us..
That's what the Japanese want
They wanted to show the people of China...
What should we do now?
When I left, Zhi Shan, she...
I'm okay, brother Chen
I am really alright...
Headlines! Headlines! General Zhou has lost!
General Zhou has lost completely...
Japan and General Zeng joined forces to defeat him
Both husband and wife are dead!
And the list of names...
In there, some are dead, some escaped
We've lost, let's surrender...
Just 2 of us cannot save the world
My brother!
Is it Kiki ? Am I mistaken?
I'm worried. You haven't worked for some time
You look very good in that!
I'm part of the Japan army secret force
Lady General!
Merry Christmas!
I represent the Japanese Army to meet you
I hope you can find one person
This is one of my people?
I don't know
His name is Chen Zhen
Did Chen Zhen not die?
We're also holding his accomplice, named Ta Kang
What if I don't give him up?
In the interest of Japan immigrants...
We expanded our patrol area of protection to them
Colonel Li Tze Men, he...
has prepared the troops...
Then you're saying, if I can't give you the person..
You'll find an excuse to fight, right?
These shameless animals. You need to do this?
You have no other option
You!
We still have...
You!
What's happened?
Keep still!
Now... I have an option
Master, why did you start Jing Wu School?
To protect China, Chen Zhen
Chen Zhen will win!
Jing Wu will live forever!
Chen Zhen will win!
Jing Wu will live forever!
I've been waiting a long time...
10 years of no martial art training
Everything is the same
Japan is mighty
There will only be one outcome
We also have one outcome
You must be crazy!
You promised not to kill him
You need to know one thing
Those who oppose Japan, I will not let them live
Watch her!
And you...
If you don't want to end up like her...
Then you just do what we do
Chen Zhen
Women are just objects for men to use
So our method is, your little sister is...
You all listen...
China is not the Sick Man of Asia
Stop! Everyone get back!
I want to fight him
Things between us shouldn't have started
Chen Zhen , I hurt you...
Come here!
You...
What? I'm here!
We'll make it back to China
We'll march forward together.
Our battlefield in China.
We only need to stick together.
No other country, no other man can defeat us
I told you to protect everyone!
We've lost, nothing else we can do...
Protect our homeland!
Are you not Chen Zhen? Wake up!
General, this way.
Salute!
