Dad, tell me a story.
I can tell you about Burma,
the time when it was called the Gold Country.
This is a story that you like that?
Yes!
There was once a beautiful country,
Burma.
Everywhere there was
forests of teak and ebony.
At that time,
tigers roamed the jungles
and herds of elephants roamed the Great Plains
.
It was
sapphires as blue as the sky azure
and rubies
even redder than your cheeks.
Jewelry
that even a princess like you would not dream.
And then?
In fact, this is a sad story.
Soldiers came from a far country
and took
of all that was most precious.
Thus we have become very poor.
My treasure!
Sit there, my darling.
I gotta go, but mom is there.
Hello!
What is needed urgently
is to form a government.
Without popular support
our government
will have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we go.
General!
I'm glad to hear your voice.
Your mother is at the central hospital.
You should come quickly.
- You come from England?
- That's it.
You stay long?
The time it takes.
LIKE THE COUNTRY
It's time the toilet.
Thank you.
Is she talking
to others?
Only a few.
Does she said
the duration of his stay?
She said "how long it takes."
Return here immediately.
Help others out there!
Our struggle!
Let them! These are patients.
Stop!
I wear the red scarf.
I have the right to kill you.
Slim!
You're back! What a joy!
My My!
Two  grandchildren already?
Yes, two grandchildren.
Give me that.
Leave, you must be tired.
I put it in your room.
Come on, kids.
Other people came to see you.
A writer and his friends.
You look like your father.
Sorry for coming so early.
We have just learned your arrival
and
can not pass up the opportunity.
This is a very important period.
Wait for me here.
Your shoes.
I'm surrounded by bad vibes
right now.
None of the 37 spirits.
It's a ghost.
So
it could be him?
Yes
this is one of the ancestors.
But
a spirit came to assist.
Coming from afar.
A woman?
Maybe.
Should I remove it?
The spirit became ghost
is even more dangerous.
In this case,
how do I get rid of?
If the people are at peace,
he will not need spirit,
and return it to where it came from.
Thank you very much.
Your advice is always valuable to me.
Hello!
My My, how are you?
I'm fine.
Banish these dogs!
Come!
General
six professors from the University
came to tell Aung San Suu Kyi
that the people supported it.
That's it?
They are fighting for democracy

It shall not proceed further?
That's it.
Well, okay.
Tomorrow, Aung San Suu Kyi will
to Shwedagon.
Your shoes.
Bad,
minds do not have warned you!

the idea of ​​consulting the people
is not the solution.
It was an idea to you.

I have been badly advised.
General Sein Lwin ,
I have a mission to tell you.

Reverend monks, the Burmese people!
The purpose of this gathering
Is to make the world hear
the people's will.
The purpose of this gathering today
is to affirm the desire of the entire country
to be a multiparty democracy.
This is what we want to demonstrate.
Some of you do not know my story
and that's quite normal
to want to know what it is.
Because I have lived abroad
and I married a foreigner,
they say I do not understand
complex history of the country.
Let me honestly say
that's true.
I lived abroad.
And I am also married to a foreigner
.
But this is not provided
my love and my devotion to my country
Tampering or mitigated.
My father gave everything he had
in political life of Burma
and he paid with his life.
As the daughter of my father,
I can not remain indifferent
events taking place right now.
The goal we hold so dear
is now in sight.
We call for free elections
and regular,
in the shortest possible time.
