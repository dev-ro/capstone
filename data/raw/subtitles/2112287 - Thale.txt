Thats it.
Good girl.
Elvis? Einar and others come here
as soon as possible.
Good.
What?
I said good.
We can not leave him here.
We need to take him to the
hospital or somewhere.
The shock of the transfer
may only make things worse.
We were told to expect this.
Lets take care of it.
Has he been here
until death?
The man did something here ...
And then all of a sudden died.
haven't you already fucked up enough, Elvis?
He freezes.
Did you find anything?
Maybe.
Here, apparently lived in the lieutenant.
Hey.
My name is Leo.
He is Elvis.
He...
He can not breathe,
if you squeeze him by the throat.
Do you recognize this?
Do you want it?
I'll put it next to you.
Should not we do something?
Oh, yeah.
Wait until Einar and others come.
How long does will it take?
Will she get here?
She clearly wants something.
What?
Canned food.
Where are you going?
I'll get the water from the car and some rolls.
Does not produce, he can not eat.
Elvis...
"Thale".
But you are welcome under the circumstances.
ECG is a good,
even if the QRP is uneven.
The case of yours.
Is likely to stress.
Hemoglobin level is good.
Additional iron you will continue to
at high doses, and ...
What's going on?
Do you know who he is?
It's just a tape recording.
... In the meantime. But do not slosh!
I found you 11 years and
eight months ago.
In August, the fourth years of
when we left them.
You should keep in mind that a lot.
I do not think that you can forget.
Although I smile a lot.
And laulatkin, do not you?
This Offspring You're very
different from your sisters.
Both internally and externally.
We knew that you are adaptive.
But did you adapt to the
whole of your being -
You, surprised us all.
Maybe it was the fact that you
was found in the early stage.
Maybe you are different from others.
Or maybe it's just a way to survive.
And this must continue.
No, no, no!
Metabolism
is the most important thing in the coming months.
This means that you must
bathe frequently.
You do not know what can happen,
if the metabolism into disrepair.
Care must be taken that will not happen.
Thale, either you take a bath?
This is not used for the moment, is it not?
Is it yours?
Maybe you have a -
Stable under there?
Maybe it's ...
Who taught you this?
Maybe ...
Maybe I could borrow it?
And to teach the little girl?
Do you want to ...
Do you want to know his name?
Eline.
How long have you been here?
Do you know?
What are you doing?
Take it easy.
That's it.
Good girl.
I know that they call you.
And that you want to follow them.
But the other, -
those that we left, -
Will find you there.
But not here.
The waves.
Leo.
Did you get my message? Are you far away?
How then was the delay?
Oh, yeah.
When you come then?
No, we ...
Can be expected.
Yeah, all right.
In the event
that they will find you, -
it is better to try.
28. january 1984.
Last night ...
Last night, we did it.
It's gone now.
Can now see.
At least it is sealed,
so it can not be traced.
It is ... No, Thale, is not there!
You are now almost impossible to control.
The attraction is too strong.
So we have to try -
cut it out.
It's been four days.
I do not know if it works.
Maybe I was right.
Maybe I'm ... corrupted you.
I do not know.
Come on, Thale.
We have to -
soak up a bit.
Jahas.
Jahas?
So.
I guess you can see what it is?
Oh, yeah.
Elvis.
Do I have to piss in?
Oh yeah, the window ...
We are probably the first
people here ... time.
I wonder how long he was there?
How he survived without food and ...
Leo, are you there?
- I am.
The woman was really cold.
I wonder if he already warmed up?
Where it was placed in a box by the way?
The beach?
So.
Thermos are still a little warm.
Dare to give coffee?
Your phone will ring.
Do you believe that ...
Do you believe that he could be ...
That's what you think that he is?
What if it turns out -
that...
That it is his?
Elvis, stop.
There are certainly sick stomach,
when they come.
Eighth on my way.
Roll.
How old is he?
Share-a ...
20?
25?
What do you think?
Are you just gonna sit there?
The girl turns five.
November.
So, Elvis has become a father.
It is hard to imagine.
I have lung cancer.
What?
I have lung cancer.
No shit?
That's what they say.
"Elvis, I have lung cancer."
"Leo, I have an illegitimate child."
"And the mother complains of the money,
I do not have. "
It was nice to catch up.
What is it?
Einar and others?
What is it?
Hello?
You were treated badly.
Every day.
And I was involved.
Far too long.
Winter hid us under the waves.
They had already begun to look for.
You were too valuable to be released.
I almost lost you on your way.
I'm cold, -
but omillesi.
They found presence
and you theirs.
But you had to keep up
of them separately.
Others would have found you there.
I found you -
and I hid you again.
We went underground -
and stayed there.
You think I'm a good person.
But I'm not.
Otherwise I would have
killed you.
But I can not.
Instead, you have to suffer here.
This is what we are.
You know that we are different.
You got it early.
You can do things
which I can not,
and what your current ...
But it you do not understand -
that is why we are here.
All we're trying to adapt to,
and in that sense we have been successful
Flourished here in the darkness.
You brought me great joy -
and despair.
Reminding me of what I found.
And what I took.
Because I know -
just like you probably already know, -
you will not fall down here.
But without me you would not be alive.
Not...
Without me, you would have lived.
Come on.
Gas cause dry mouth.
But apart from that ...
... It's not dangerous.
Here is something to drink.
Mustaviinimarjatotia.
There's nothing suspicious.
Who are you?
In order to get relevant,
I am making a body.
Invited to such a party ...
Ninaksi.
NINA and looking for girls.
Where's Leo?
NINA believes that
you have met him.
Have you met Thalén?
Then we all agree -
that he is different from us.
A long time ago, we,
which should then people -
we began to understand the number of our forces.
So lyöttäydyimme together, and the individual
was to serve the common good.
But a part fell out.
They are passed through stream
but out of the stream.
And they stayed there.
The different challenges of different shaped
the properties, characteristics and sizes.
Abnormal discovered
asylum from deep within the forest.
All were sensitive,
and they were rarely observed.
Their metabolism to produce
stronger than ours in the heat.
That energy is not only unique,
Also, different.
It is their fingerprints.
So years after we knew -
that we had found the right Thalén.
There is only one small problem.
The unit will beep yeah ...
But ... we can not find him.
I am honest and I hope
that you are also.
Now totissasi is something suspicious.
So if you know,
which could be Thale, -
Now would be the time to tell me that.
And if the answer to satisfy ...
I understand that in doubt.
They may have such an effect.
Will feel compassion.
So much so, that would sacrifice
everything for them.
Even in their own lives.
He may seem like harmless.
As innocent, eksyneeltä girl.
But the light under the skin,
large, brown eyes behind ...
You will not believe what's in there.
Leo!
Hey, give him something to drink!
There's something here.
Thale?
Is not enough people have already
suffered because of you?
I think enough is enough.
Leo?
Are you in it?
Eye-witnesses, a woman ...
is 20 - 25-year-old, 160 - 170 cm.
Eyewitness 1 permits
missing woman -
may optionally be
so-called "huldra".
Well?
Not anytime soon.
How much did you get the time?
All right ...
They said, -
that I -
I am healthy.
Healthy?
Yes.
Just like that?
Yes.
Are not you glad?
I am.
Will you sweep away something
Old Aunt tomorrow?
Why not.
Förskottia.
But it's not for you.
All the days go by.
We grow old.
Hour by hour.
From year to year.
If you are lucky, find someone
with which to grow old.
Or maybe not ever.
Maybe for a while.
Maybe forever.
Designing or chance, -
suddenly has doubled.
And sometimes I just want to know -
that it was intended to.
Someone whose result will do anything.
Jeopardize everything.
Worth living for.
And dies.
And when the day comes -
I hope that you,
one way or another, -
you are as lucky as I have been.
Thank you.
And forgive me.
