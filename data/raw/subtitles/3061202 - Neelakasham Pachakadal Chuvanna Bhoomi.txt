Blue sky, green sea, red earth
2 'Kings' please
Where are you off to?
Didn't I warn you, Suni
I'm doing this ride all by myself?
What will I do
all alone in Kannur?
I don't know myself
where I am going
You've enough money
for petrol and food, right?
What does it matter
where we go?
I've been hunting for a bike
ever since you mentioned the trip
But didn't get one
This is my uncle's 'daughter'!
Slinked off with it saying
I wanted to buy some fish
So you've eloped with
your uncle's 'daughter', eh?
What else can I do
when you make such sudden plans?
What are our plans?
Before nightfall as of now
to reach Jinto's homestay
Nice!
So let's go
Kasi
Why don't we take a train?
It'll take only 2-3 days
- Who told you I'm going there?
- Where else?
To the Himalayas
Himalayas...!
Cream... nice
- Cream...?
- Malana cream, world's best hashish
'My solo ride to the Himalayas
is still a distant dream'
'Suni has always been like this'
'His entry is always unexpected'

Be ready, 2 bikes
are approaching

Pull the twine
Push him down
Suni...!
Get the money
Finish him off
Look! More bikes
Let's escape
Hey! Are you okay?
What happened?
Are you alright?
You okay?
Who are those guys?
- Suni, are you okay?
- I'm alright
- You are not hurt, are you?
- I'm alright
- Are you from Kerala?
- Yes
- I am from Kochi
- I'm from Calicut
It's not right to ask
a rider where he's heading
But, you know
this place is dangerous
Yeah man
Thieves, naxals, police
We had no idea
Hey Jitu, let them
ride with us
- Yes... why not?
- Let them
You should
ride with us, man
- Where are you off to?
- Puri
Puri?
What's in Puri?
Music, women and waves
Can you boys handle that?
- Come with us, man
- Come on
sanjay!!
Jinu... the man!
Bro, long time
She's lshita
- Our country's most wanted surfer girl
- Good to meet you, lshita
Meet the rest of the gang
'Puri'
'The freedom and happiness
every man searches for... plenty here'
'I feel being happy
is all that matters'
Where are you going?
What are you up to?
Surfing
Aren't you coming?
This isn't like washing clothes
in the hostel with detergent Surf!
You'll swallow salt water
What happened?
Aren't you going?
I'm going!
The waves are really bad, huh?
Yeah!
Really... really bad
It's okay
How is Puri?
Puri is peaceful
So Sanjay told me
you are from Kerala?
I love that place
I'm from Pondicherry
Pondicherry?
Do you know Tamil?
Do I know?!
I'm a Tamilian
I love that language
'Body for land
Life for Thamizh'
Anyway, let's go
Go ahead
I'll wait for you here
Small waves, no?
Okay
Thank God!
Great escape!
Kasi
- She says she's returning to Australia
- So what?
She says she'll take me along too
Okay! go
Tell me, Kasi
Is this love... or lust?
Shut up and sleep
Whatever it is, no problem
Pig! I'll kill you
Okay, good night
Aiyo!
- Hi Kasi?
- Hi lshita
It's time to surf
I don't know
- You have to teach me
- Come ya, I can teach you
The waves are good today
'I feel if you want to be happy
be with a happy person'
Hey guys!
Let's play this forest game
- Forest game?
- It's fun
There is a forest nearby
If you walk through it for 2 kms
you come to a fantastic beach
But listen, wrong direction
and you go around in loops
We'll get in at different
entry points in the forest
Whoever reaches
the beach first, wins
Do you want to play?
Will there be animals?
May be a few wolves
Last time we played
a guy didn't return
That's all
- Pearly
- I dare not go there
- You want to go, Lee?
- No, thank you
I'm coming too
Sorry... only boys
- Alright boys, see you on the beach
- Good luck, Jinu
See you
Bye
- Good luck, man
- See you guys
- Bye, bro
- See you, dude
I'll see you there

See you
- Hey Jinu!

- Where the hell were you, man?
- I think we should go that way
There's the beach!
Yeah! We made it
Run... run... run
Wow! This is beautiful
Yeah! Jinu
About time you guys
Hey!
Suni isn't here as yet
Don't stress, man
He'll find his way
I'm going to find him
No Kasi, its against the rules
F*** the rules
Come on, man
Not nice, huh?
Suni!??
SUNI
I figured I won't be
able to find my way
I knew you'd come
looking for me
I decided to sit here
and not tire myself
- Come, let's take a walk
- Alright
Ah toddy!
It is our destiny
Brilliant night, eh?
Puri is Puri
Kasi...?
Do you know the most
important rule of surfing?
Golden rule
One man, one wave
Do you have a girl friend?
I'm sorry
Catch it
Good one
Send it this way
- Catch it, Jin
- I got it
Move here
Kasi, come on
Send it to Kadhi
Good one, Kasi
This way
Be rig ht back
Why don't you play with us?
I'm not in the mood
You want to do something?
Do what?
Come with me?
Come on
Hey!
Are we lost?
- I think it's that way
- That way?
Who is that girl?
You don't look like
you've gone through so much
I thought I could forget
We leave tomorrow morning
Why?
I mean... where?!
Kolkata
Okay, I'm no one
to hold you back
But I'd like to know about
your trip and where you reach
Rider brotherhood, bro
She moved on with
a surfer dude, man
Really?
Check out this picture
- Safe ride, dude
- Thank you
Come on guys
Let's help them
Push
Bye guys
Push
That's it
That's it
"Oh wandering soul...!"
"What is your direction...?"
'I knew lshita was
key to my happiness'
'Maybe happiness
is not what I want'
What's wrong?
This headlight has
conked off again
What do we do?
Ride in front
- Kasi...?
- What?
I feel like
eating biriyani
In the middle
of the night...?
There is no night or day
to eat biriyani in Kannur
There is a place
in Kolkata also
Kasi, where are we?
We've been wandering
around these hills for so long
I have no idea
I can't go a single foot forward
I'm switching off here
Bamanghati
What's that place?
Who knows!
Suni?
Kasi!?
Who are these people?
- Where are we?
- I don't know
Goodness!
Last night I heard
the sound of Bullet bikes
Here, only 2 kinds of
people ride a Bullet
Either the police
or militants
Which category
do you belong to?
No sir, we were just
wandering and got lost
Oh I see! You mean, you got here by just
wandering all the way from Kerala?
Yes
Fine, please come
to my house also
It's okay
Put your guns down
Help them with their bags
Please come
Why don't you take a dip
in the river and refresh yourself?
What a strange creature!
Please eat
Do you have a destination in mind?
Or intend to continue wandering?
Just wander
Gauri...?
Serve them some more
When E.M.S formed his 1st
communist govt in Kerala...
...I was around 20 years old
When he came to Calcutta for
a meeting, we were all so happy
All of us went to meet him
Two qualities a good politician
must have... honesty and courtesy
"Sacrificial tombstones..."
I forgot
I've forgotten everything
When mining companies
laid their eyes on our villages...
...they began calling us militants
Fought them
We fought them
And in that long period
of conflict I met my wife...
...and lost her also
Even before I lost her
I had already faced defeat
I lost her because I delayed
moving out of those villages
But at least I could bring the villagers
and my daughter Gauri here
Companies...
...companies are
running this country
Where are you
going actually?
Nagaland
Where is Nagaland?
There
There?
Why are you going there?
To meet his girl
So far... just to meet her?
She is very lucky
Kerala is here
and Nagaland there
Then how did they meet?
Tell me
'The day Dalit student
Raji committed suicide'
'Not being able to
pay her college fees'
'Long live
Student federation of India'
'Long live the revolution'
'Raji's suicide triggered
agitations all over Kerala'
'In our college also'
Colleges are no longer for education
They are now just business
We are not students any more
Just tools for them
to make profits
If we want to see
our friends every day...
...we have to ensure now
they have money for their fees
These business men have
imposed that liability on us
'Our college had students
from all over India'
'Take action against banks
for refusing loans'
'Police... render justice'
'Long live
student unity'
Hello?
Hello?
'The final day of
the 6th semester series exams'
'That's the day
they started talking'
Kasi
Kasi
Assi, can I ask
what you told?
- Kasi
- No, Shyam
Hello
I'll be right back
Hello
Hey, Shyam
This is my friend, Assi
Hello
Assi... Kasi
Kasi... Assi
She wanted to thank you
for protecting her in today's strike
That's okay
I'm leaving
See you later
- Thank you
- You're welcome
Assi, 4th year
architecture, rig ht?
- Yes
- You can speak Malayalam?
All my friends speak
to me in Malayalam
And I reply in English
Oh! Okay
I've seen you many times
Me too
Leading all the fights
Kasi
I have to go now
okay
Shall I call the college
intercom at night?
But girls say
you never call anybody
I never had to
- When did you start dreaming this big?
- I've not finished, Kasi
Hills all around... and...?
Yellow flowers
- That's not how yellow is pronounced
- That's how we say it in Kannur
Oh really?
Kasi, comrade is waiting
Okay
Come
Kasi, you've not been introduced
to comrade Shekar yet, right?
Lal Salam
(Red salute)
Raji's suicide is
a good political issue for us
'It was the same day
Kasi argued...'
'...with those who tried to exploit
Raji's death for gains in the election'
You are Malikavettil
Abdu Haji's son, right?
No wonder this arrogance!
However staunch a Leftist you are
your dad's blood runs in you!
Today's strike was to fight
for a girl's right to live
Never again step into
this hostel with such conspiracies
Catch that white-guy
Catch him!
Assi is from Nagaland, right?
Yeah
Assi's dad was in Assam Rifles
posted in Nagaland
He is a Marathi
who married a Naga girl
So she's mixed
They both were killed
Shot dead!
It's dad... one sec
Hello?
Dad?
Hello?
I thought you went off to sleep
I don't sleep much
I sleep late
Tie him to the tree
Hello?
Was that Suni?
Yes, do you know him?
Yes, he's with you always
All my friends were out
because of the strike
Didn't you go, Assi?
No
Do you want to go?
Yeah, but how...?
We can ride on
my motorcycle
'That day itself I knew
Kasi had decided his destiny'
"Did half your crystalline tears
glisten to glide away?"
"As golden flames sway
in your dreams alive"
"Did half your crystalline tears
glitter to be wiped away?"
"As golden flames blaze
in your dreams alive"
What happened
to your mom and dad?
I'm sorry
While raiding for militants
one of my dad's men...
...killed a powerful civilian
family member by mistake
And they took revenge
Still taking...!!
That day my mom
fought like a panther
They had to kill
my mom to get to my dad
Tell me something about yours
I was born and brought up in Dubai
My grandfather brought me here
insisting I do college in Kerala
Two years ago rest of my family too
returned to settle here
You are very lucky, Kasi
After Paru's husband died...
...if she happened to like
a guy, she'll smile at him
It means you can walk
into her house even at midnight
She has smiled at me!
And?
And what else?
I went to her house
- Don't bluff
- I swear it's true
Hey. go
"Like the night-rain on these lanes
with scent of thunder clouds"
"Moonlit glow to these tears
like a consolation appears"
I think I'm in love with you
"Unaware... within the soul
random memories dwell"
"Within the heart's depth,
silence like unspoken pain pervades"
Assi?
Which is the most
beautiful place you've seen?
Tawang!
- Arunachal Pradesh?
- Exactly
"Like the night-rain on these lanes
with scent of thunder clouds"
"Moonlit glow to these tears
like a consolation appears"
What is it Suni, my boy?
It's festival time at the temple
If you happen to go there, come home
- I'll give you delicious fish curry and rice
- Okay sister
Sister? Call me Paru
when you come home
Dear God!
You heard my prayers
Come in Suni, my boy
There's yummy fish curry and rice
Eat... Suni, my boy
What do you think?
Is this love or lust?
Aren't both the same?!
Did you meet Paru
again after that?
No
Will you meet her again?
No
Never again
Kasi, how is it here?
Excellent
We've seen
and learnt a lot
Really?
You want to
tell me something?
Dada, we can make
a machine for this
Machine?
What kind of machine?
Look at this
Aah! A machine
to powder rice
The idea is good
But where will
the money come from?
Bimal'da, we don't need money
Just that scooter will do
- Scooter?
- Yes
Who is there
in Nagaland?
Gauri told me everything
It's true that I lost out in the fight
with the mining companies
But do you know what
was my biggest failure?
Losing my wife, Gauri's mother
Son, don't delay!
'In Nagaland Assi's life
may be in danger'
'Though I was ready to give up everything
for her, what hurt me most was... she left me'
'And I was afraid
of getting hurt again'
"Don't delay!"
'These words of Bimal'da'
'Before snow covers the roads...'
'...first I should reach Nagaland'
'I must see Assi'
Where to now?
Himalayas?
Via Nagaland
Let's go
Bimal'da, I'll never forget
all these days here with you
- Will you come back?
- Let's see
Have you found
your destination?
I'll definitely
reach where I must
I will wait for
the sound of Bullets
Bye, Gauri
Will you come back?

Kasi?
You go ahead
Catch me in the highway
- Rs 10, eh?
- Yes
Go...!
Hey! Go, you scumbag!!
Dada?
How come you have
a Malayalam paper here?
'Shyam's murder:
new clues on the accused'
'Sketch of the suspect'
Suni...?
Take the U-turn
Where were you?
A lorry...
...almost killed me!
- Did you fall?
- Nothing serious
- Now my bike has a puncture too
- That road was full of nails
Read this
Kasi, this guy was sitting
in the lorry that tried to kill me
Aw! Come on!
You are imagining it
Kasi, you have to believe me
I'm damn sure
It is reported here
he's trying to escape to Nepal
Shyam's dad's enemies
were the guys who killed him
Will we nab him if we follow?
What if we confirm it is him?
What is it?
What happened?
Malayali?
No wonder the roads
are full of nails!
You've got to live up to
your native nature, eh?
Just look at my bike
Do you have
Sub Inspector Alex's number?
Did you note the lorry
registration number?
WB 052757
Call and tell him
Is it someone you know?
Wheel chain is ruined
It has to be changed
It has to come
from the town
Father!
We are here
'Everybody loved Shyam'
'His death changed everything'
'Those last days in college...'
'...when there were continuous fall outs
between locals and students'
'Vendor, a local thug who had
issues with Shyam and his friends...'
'...barged one night
into our ever vigilant hostel'
'Vendor and his friends who vanished
that night never came back'
Shyam...!!
'But next day onwards...'
Did you guys see Shyam?
'Shyam was missing!'
Did Shyam tell you
he was going anywhere?
No
Where is Shyam?
We are still searching, Assi
Probably an emergency at home
No! He would have told me
I am worried, Kasi
Don't worry
We'll find him
We've informed the Andaman Police
They'll inform his people
I'll also let you know
if I get any information
Thank you, sir
Kasim, Sub Inspector Alex here
Greetings, sir
Body is completely decomposed
Don't know what happened
We can't say anything
until after the postmortem
Shvam...?!?!
My God!
5hyam!!
'By the time warrant was issued, Vendor had
absconded somewhere North of India'
'Everything might be coincidental'
'Even Suni imagining
he saw Shyam's murderer!'
What's your name?
Raghav!
I mean, Raghavan
They must be hungry...?
Aren't you hungry?
Let's eat whatever is here
He'll be back with
the chain by then
How long have you
you been living here?
Around 20 years
Ever gone back to Kerala?
I killed a man back home
In a frenzy of
politics and youth
I didn't think twice when
leaders asked me to do it
When it came to a point
where I'd be in jail, I left Kerala
Wandered around a lot
and finally reached here
This is also a kind of jail
Dada!
There! Your man is here
Okay...?
We were just leaving
Don't leave
at this late hour
I heard about
some riots up north
Sleep here and
leave early tomorrow
Can you drop him off in the town?
Sure, why not?
Raghav'etta
this is on our behalf
We may not
meet again, eh?
When I see you guys I feel there's still
hope to achieve something in life
As if I have people to call
my own from back home
Raghav'etta, this road we came by
can lead you back home too!
All the way from Kerala
'All along I kept meeting up with destiny
on the same road I chose to avoid it'
'One thing I was
always sure about was...'
'...my destiny
is my decision'
'And I chose
to be with her'
My father's family says
I always bring misfortune and death
It's not your fault, Assi
No?
First it was my parents
And now... Shyam
Do you have to go back
to Nagaland after college?
Grandma doesn't
want me to go to Nagaland
She says their revenge
is not over yet
And I don't want to go back
to my father's family in Mumbai
They call me chinky... Nepali
Shall I look for
a job in Bangalore?
Will you come to
meet me there?
I will come to even
Nagaland to see you
But Assi...
Will you come home?
You want to come to my house?
To Chendamanglur Malikaveettil
Abdul Haji's house?
I know my father will agree
I'm not committing any sin, Suni
He will agree?!
He's post-modern!!
He may not be modern
But he's never opposed
my decision even if he wasn't for it
If he did, I'll go
to Bangalore with Assi
Where else will she go?
In short, you can't
live without her?
'Engineering student
Shyam's murder'
'Regarding the gruesome murder of
college student Shyam, Andaman native...'
'...investigations are progressing'
'His body was found 3 days ago
in a decomposed state'
'His college mates
identified the body'
'Arrest warrant has been issued
against the accused Anil Vendor'
'Shyam's parents arrived from Andamans
yesterday to receive his mortal remains'
'Just another month more in college'
'Shyam is no more'
'So also the vacation
plans to Andaman'
'Assi needed a change'
'I was wondering how to tell
my family about this, when...'
- Peace be with you
- And upon you be peace, father
I saw the news about a boy
from your college murdered?
He was my close friend
We also saw you
hugging a Nepali girl
This is not America you know!
Who is she?
My college mate
Is that all?!
If members of the organisation, friends
and family ask me, what shall I say?
Tell me
Let it not be said
in future, that I lied
Who is she?
I love her!
When are you coming home?
How can you take such
a decision all by yourself?
What will I tell
my own family?
My dear Asma, stop blabbering
What do you want me to do?
You know his nature
Wasn't it your ideological father
who brought him from Dubai...
...when he was just 10
and pampered him rotten?
Your organisation is more
important to you than our son
Don't play with my son's life
My dear Asma, use
your God given brains!
If we don't agree, what if he registers
his marriage and lives with her?
What will we tell
everyone then?
Isn't it better for us to
get them decently married?
After all, she is an orphan, no?
Hello?
Fathima, did you hear?
Kasi is bringing a girl
home from his college
The family is planning
to get them married
'The organization is planning to
ramp down its own youth wings'
'And concentrate on People welfare party
in view of the upcoming elections'
'Not many from where I come from
will accept her... l knew'
Kasi, those at home
have always been bourgeoise
Why don't you stay
with Pachu in Bangalore?
Or at Jinto's homestay
estate in Wayanad?
And then?
And then what else?
Live your life
happily forever
Since me coming in is of no use and
your father can't stand the sight of me...
...I better go, Kasi
okay
Call me
You can eat chicken curry and
rice pancake hereafter daily, eh?
Don't worry
Everybody will love you
Shall I go? I'm in
the next district
Okay, see you
Kasi'kka??
Do you know who she is?
Isn't she Assi'tha
She's so lovely!
- Wafa??
- Yes
- Where is mother?
- Inside
'In Karnataka election community
votes supported the Right wing'
They've come
'Though Party was shocked, they're confident
a similar situation won't arise in Kerala'
We'll meet at
the mosque tonight
Elections are next month
Isn't it a little too late already?
We'll discuss it tonight
Our treasurer now has
family matters to deal with
okay
Why don't you
think it over again?
Religion is different
from noble ancestry
To me religion, nobility and state
are all one and the same
She does not even
speak Malayalam
Oh Lord! Why is my son
destined this way?!
It's alright, Asma
God will set things right
My sister is in Dubai
But her daughter
likes to live here
lam leaving for Kochi directly
after the meeting at the mosque
I'll be back
only after 2 days
Get the downstairs room
ready for her to stay
By the time I come back
be ready to get married
Abdulla'ka
- ls Fathima at home?
- She is
Ask her to come and stay here
Let this girl have some company
Father?
Mother?
I'm sorry, mom
if I disappointed you
What is she saying?
She says she is sorry
if you are upset
And that she likes
Kasi'ka very much!!
Ask her what she'd like to drink?
Assi'tha, what would you like?
Tea, coffee or a cool drink?
Do we have cool drinks?!
Tea will be fine
She says tea will do
She seems to know
Malayalam, grandma!
While they were playing inside the jungle
there came a huge elephant
The elephant roared, trumpeted
And they were all shivering
Now what happened?
They were all frightened
And they start running
running inside the jungle
In between the big trees
Hello, ladies
God! What am I seeing?
That too, before marriage!
- What is it?
- Nothing
Do you like it here?
Nobody likes me... right?
You like her, don't you, Wafa?
- Yeah, she loves me a lot
- I love you too
Wafa... shall I bite
and eat you up?
That's not a problem, aunt
I didn't take it seriously at all
Isn't it better not to marry
within close relations?
I am not at all upset
My dear child
God will bless you!
His father wants
to get them married
We are forced to obey
the men of our house, isn't it?
How can I help you, aunt?
Teach her the ways
of our religion?
Does she know Malayalam?
I can't understand
her Malayalam
What shall I do first?
Teach her Malayalam
or the ways of our religion?
Eat, my dear
Good morning, Assi
Good morning
I am Fathima
Oh hi!
Sorry, I overslept
And you said
she doesn't know Malayalam?!
Now you've got a new
older sister, eh?
Look who has come!
Fathima?
When did you come?
What's news?
You are the one
making the headlines!
Where did you
get the Bullet bike?
It came by train cargo
I went to bring it
Assi, she's Fathima
My childhood friend
We are already friends
I came because aunt said you had
snatched a girl from college
She has entrusted me to
teach her our religious ways
There's no need for all that
Just give her company
Isn't that rig ht, mother?
She may be an orphan
and a Christian
But on what basis are you
allowing her to stay here?
Election is round the corner
As it is the people from our own
community disagree with us
To top it all a Chinese girl
lives in our treasurer's house
'My father had many reasons
to go back on his decision'
'But not me!'
I thought people here
will understand the situation
Let's go to Bangalore
We'll find jobs or something
Everything will be alright
Kasi, we just need
to wait for little more
My dear teacher
I'm totally confused
What's there to think about?
How can she marry
without convening?
But he isn't allowing us to do that
When my daughter fell in love with
a Hindu what an uproar it caused!
Asma, do you remember
what a ruckus you made?
He was even ready to convert
Yet none of you agreed
My daughter is full of woes
when she calls from Saudi even now
- Which place does she belong to?
- Who knows?
Isn't it inauspicious if you have
a non-muslim living in the house?
So the kids will
look like her, eh?
If families like yours also
stoop to such levels...?
Unheard of things
are now happening here
What's happened?
Where is Assi?
Don't worry!
I've spoken to Abdulla'ka
We'll make him understand
and get Fathima married to him
He will be alright
Kasi, sit... eat
'I didn't try to find out how Assi could go
away to Nagaland without a word to me'
'But when my mother started the topic
of marriage to Fathima again...'
'...I decided to hit the road'
'For answers!'
Tawang?
What are you up to?
I am going
on a journey
And this?
On my bike
Where to?
I don't know
Yet?
I'll also come
No!
Did you call Assi?
No
She has not
reached Bangalore
- Has she gone to Nagaland?
- Some things are best forgotten
That's why I'm going
on this journey now
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow
Okay, I'm leaving
Happy journey
'Mind, body and bikes
are begnning to get tired'
'Riots everywhere
through out Assam borders'
Looks like trouble
Shall we go back and
cross over during the day?
Let's not turn back
We'll see what happens
What happened, my child?
Kasi?
What is it?
Don't cry
- What's your name?
- Fatimah
Where's your house?
We'll take you home
Will you come with us?
Over there
This way
Shall we go back?
How can we
leave her alone?
Where is your house, dear?
There
Come
Don't cry
Everything will be alright
Anybody here?
Who are you?!
We came to
return this child
We didn't do anything
But who are you?
Answer!
Fatimah!
Mummy
They haven't done
anything wrong!
They saved my baby
Please forgive us
Fathima told us everything
Thank you very, very much
You should both leave now
They might come back any time
Leave right now!
Kasi?
Kasi...?
"Even after wandering
through the jungles..."
Why are we here?
This trip is over for me
I must get back home
I'll send the bike by train
What about Assi?
After coming so far?
I began this ride alone
Kasim! So that's all
between us, eh?
If I'm not even able to take care
of my old parents... then what?!
"Even after wandering
through the jungles..."
"...sages lose their hearts"
Brother?
Is there any train to South India?
Chennai, Hyderabad,
Bangalore... any of these places?
No, don't disturb me
"if I leave the love of my heart,
I won't find again"
Hello?
Kasi'ka?
Where are you?
We've made
a thousand calls
You've not even bothered
to tell us if you are dead or alive
Where is mother?
She just slept
She has been so worried and
worked up on what's happened
Tell her I'm coming back
Really?!
Where are you now?
I don't know
And will Assi
be with you?
No
Why?
"Wandering through million births
I've got this cherished human life"
"And if this life withers away without you
it is no longer precious to me, my dear"
"Address my love, oh Lord!"
"Protect my love, oh God!!"
"I won't let you go"
"I will always keep you in my heart
I won't let you go"
"You will always be
in the cockles of my heart"
"if I leave my beloved of my heart..."
"won't find my life again
I won't let you go"
"I won't let you go... ever"
- I'm sorry, Suni
- What for, Kasi?
I wanted to forget everything
This journey was only for that
Even trying to get close
to lshita was for that reason
And also the people we met
like Bimal'da and Raghav'tten...
...were regretting
what they had lost
That was when I realized
I had to meet Assi
But in yesterday's riot
when I saw that lady...
...she reminded me of my mother
and I lost grip on myself, Suni
I understand what
you are going through, Kasi
With no one to rescue her
that kid stranded on the road...
...isn't she like my Assi?
I want to meet her, Suni
I didn't come with you to see
the Himalayas or smoke Malana cream
Wasn't it just to see you
and Assi together again?
Kasi
Do you remember the dream
I told you about in our hostel?
Yellow (!) flowers
and mountains all around
That was Gauri's land
My mom showed them
to me in my dreams
The moment you meet Assi
I promised Gauri I'd go back to her
I had the same
dream last night
Shall I go back
to her now, Kasi?
'I always thought I was
protecting Suni and Assi'
'But I was wrong'
'Suni's only intension
was to ensure I meet Assi'
'Assi was only trying to ensure
I had no problems in my life'
'They were all protecting me'
'They were all
loving me'
Ap International
"As the blue sky graces, drizzles
in my mind, like a wave, I veer away"
"Like wandering clouds obscure
I wander in search of desire"
Ap International
"In a halo of kaleidoscopic illusion
silently time stood still"
"Are you in front of me, unfading?
Or within you am I residing?"
"Knocking at the heart that hums
to an off-beat rhythm I waltz"
Ap International
"As the blue sky graces, drizzles
in my mind, like a wave, I veer away"
"Move away"
"I veer away"
Ap International
"I veer away"
"Veer away"
"Are you in front of me, unfading?
Or within you am I residing?"
"Knocking at the heart that hums
to an off-beat rhythm I dance"
Ap International
Does he like the food?
Do you like the food?
Very nice!
He likes it, grandma
I can't believe he came all this way
to see you, but you both should leave!
The people who are already
provoked by your presence...
...will be angry
with his arrival
Grandma says they are
still out for revenge
She thinks we should
leave this place
What will we do now?
We can ride on
my motorcycle
Forever?
Assi
This way
Assi!
Kasi, where will we go now?
It would have started
snowing in Tawang
Do you want to go?!
