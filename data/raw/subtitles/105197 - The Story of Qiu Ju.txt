Meizi, it's here
Stop
Qinglai, we're there
Easy, easy
Meizi, take the bag
Come in
Sit down
Well, what's the matter?
My husband, he's been kicked
Kicked? Where
Down there
Down there
T ake off your pants and let me see
Easy, easy
Where're you from? Xigaouzi
Come all the way from there
That man looks more like a vet
Meizi
What did he say
Just need to keep it straight and
let air get to it
I'll be okay in a few days
This is his report
Need to get it stamped
It's a long trip, you feel okay
I'm fine
It's you I'm worried about
If we can't fix your plumbing
We're stuck with the single child policy
for good
A boy or a girl in here, who knows
I'll be all right, don't worry
The doctor is a specialist
If he said I'll be fine, I'll be fine
It just takes a little while
It's not that simple
I'll talk to him when I'm back
Qiu Ju, have you eaten?
Y es
You two sit still
I'll get you some food
Is he in? Y es, yes, come
Auntie Qiu Ju
Is he in
Y es, he is
Some noodles? Have some noodles
have some noodles
I'll get you some noodles
I've eaten. You go ahead
Have some
I've eaten
Just a little
No, I've just eaten. It's cold
if it matters to you
Here's the medical report
Read it
T ell us what to do
Do what you want
Read it, Qiu Ju has brought it to you
What the hell had you know?
It's you who kicked him
So tell us what to do
What to do
Go ask him why I did it
You're the head of the village
You can't kick a man where he lives
So I kicked him
what did you want now?
You tell us
what do you think should be done
If you insist
but don't blame me for being crude
I'll go stand in the courtyard
with my legs open
and let him kick me back. How's that
If that's your answer, forget it
Forget it then
What kind of justice is this?
Time I went
Don't bother to see me off
Don't walk too fast
Goodbye, Auntie. Don't walk too fast
Dad
Go eat something. It's in the pot
Well, what did he say?
T aken your medicine
What did he say
Nothing to be done, that's what he said
Nothing to be done? The bully
He's the Chief, how can he say that
I'll go into the village tomorrow
Good idea, Must be justice somewhere
Meizi, Qiu Ju's so big now
You go with her tomorrow
Careful, Qiu Ju, the road's slippery
Meizi, take care of your sister
The road is slippery
take good care of her
Father, go back to the house
Go back to the house
Sister, be careful
the road is slippery
Where are you going, Qiu Ju
The village
The village? T ake care
The Village
He had on a padded jacket
He took it off
Said, What's the matter?
I said, I've told you what the matter is.
And a fight broke out between us
So he started it
He started it
is that what you' re saying
No, he just took off his jacket
Didn't hit me
I took off my jacket and hung it up
I hadn't hit him yet
He took off his jacket
hung it up
and said
You and your wife, your daughters
the four of you
Kicked me and hit me
What the hell's the deal
I hit him. He didn't hit back
I don't think that's possible
Y es? Who are you looking for
I want to see Officer Li
Officer Li
Go over there
Have a seat first
I'll be with you in a minute
What's the matter
Wan Qinglai
What's happened to him?
He's been kicked
Are you Qinglai's wife?
I couldn't make it to his wedding
I heard his wife was a beauty.
So that's you
You're having a baby!
Sit down...
Bruises on the right chest wall
Ieft testicle slightly swollen
slightly swollen...
Qinglai's such a harmless guy
How'd he get in a fight? With whom
With our Chief
You mean Wang Shantang
Y es
Why
We grow chilly, you know
Hey, Li, I'll take this. Here
You know we grow chilly, don't you
Y es I do
You do
Well, we wanted to put up
a storaged shed
We got the bricks and tiles ready
But the Chief kept refusing
our application
So instead
We cleared a place by our allocated land
T o make room for the chilly shed
But the Chief still refused claimed
there was an order
So I said, if you have this order
Let me see it
But he refused
He's the order he said
And he just wouldn't show it to me
Mind you, there is such a document
The land is for growing crops
If everyone builds on it
What're we going to eat
But does this document
say he can beat people
He's the Chief
A few knocks are one thing
But to kick a man where it counts
It takes two to start a fight
He must have been provoked
What's the reason?
Why
Why
My brother was mad. He swore at him
Who are you? I'm Wan Qinglai's sister
What did your brother say
He cursed the Chief
said he'd have no heirs
Said he could only raise hens
Your brother was wrong then
Everyone knows
that the Chief only has daughters
Your brother's words cut him
where it hurts
The family planning policy means
he'll have no heirs
It's cruel to remind him of it
Even so, he's got no right
to beat people up
He's the Chief
he shouldn't have kicked him there
I asked him what should be done
He said he's kicked, and that's that
I said, if you won't do something
who will
You're the Chief, but you beat him
It's not right
You're what you're here for? Right
Y es
I tell you, he's wrong
to have kicked your husband
Course he is! And where it counts
If that doesn't get better, we...
All right, all right
I've said he's wrong
Now, go home first
In the next day or two
I'll come and sort things out
I want both of you
to do some self-criticism
Is that clear
Y es
You go home first, I'm busy today
You can leave this with me
Then when will you come
In the next day or two
Officer Li, please come soon
Goodbye, Li
Goodbye now
Dad, Dad
Staying warm
It's you, Li. Come and get warm
Wang
I want to talk to Wang
why don't you go outside
What brought you here?
Good looking maize
Wang
I've read the medical report
and been to see Qinglai
He shouldn't have cursed you
I've told him off
But you, too were wrong
You're his elder, and you're the Chief
Shouldn't have beat him like that
I was just following orders!
But the orders don't say
you can beat people up
If he's any sense
He should ask himself
why he got kicked
You're the Chief
Hitting him has one thing
But you shouldn't a kicked him there
It shut him up, didn't it
Please, please
You go out first, Qiu Ju
I want to talk to the Chief alone
So that's how we'll settle it
Qiu Ju
as I see it
he shouldn't have kicked your husband
I've said this to his face
But Qinglai's got a sharp tongue too
So, both sides must admit they're wrong
As mediator, here's what I think
Wang should pay for Qinglai's
medical costs and lost wages
$200 in all, what do you think
I'm not after his money
I just want an explanation
The Chief is obstinate
but he's the head here
Don't make him lose face
Besides, Qinglai isn't too badly hurt
That's it then
He'll pay.
That shows you're right and
he's wrong
Let's settle for that
All right? That's what's we'll do
T omorrow, bring the medical bills
to his place
Bring a receipt with you too
He'll give you the money
And you can put this all behind you
Chief
Got the bills and the receipt
Y es, they're all here
That's 200 dollars in all
All yours
Chief, what's this
What's this? You think it's so easy
I'm not after your money
I want justice
Justice? You think I've given in
It's only that Office Li came so far
I can't let him lose face
There are twenty 1 0 dollar notes there
Bow your head and pick them up
For each one you pick up
you bow your head to me
When you've done that 20 times
we can call it quits
I'll say when we quit
I want to speak to Officer Li
He's gone to the county town
for a meeting
For a meeting? When will he be back
Not sure
The thing could have been done with
But he flung the money on the ground
Said those terrible things
I can't believe there's no justice
My family is no good with words
I can't go myself
But it's such a long way
to the county town
I worry about you, in your condition
Why worry?
If I'm going to lose the baby
just a cough will do
If I'm not
a rolling pin couldn't pop it out
T ake money with you tomorrow
We don't have much cash
I'll bring a cartload of chilly
It's the wrong season
Won't get much for them
It's not the money I'm after
I just want him to do right by us
Meizi
Be careful
Don't let the chilly fall out
Are those for sale?
Y es How much would you pay
$3.5 per catty
$3.50? $4
All right, $4, is that a deal?
$4? All right
Meizi, unload the chillies
Eleven catties in all
Eleven and a half
All right, eleven and a half
Here's 1 00. 1 22 altogether. Y es
The fare to town is 7.50 each
That much
There's a cheaper fare
If we can get six people
Then it's 2.50 each
Let's go that way then
The County T own
When I came back from work
I found the door has been pried open
So I came straight here to report it
those papers, what're they for
Complaint letters
I haven't got one
You haven't? Go to the post office
by the entrance
Look for a guy named Zhang
T ell him your case
He can write the letter for you
Just this way. He'll do it for you
Can you help me write a letter?
What sort to of letter
A complaint letter
How strongly worded you want it
What do you mean?
I could word it mildly
give both of your a way out
T o back down if things got really rough
Or I could be merciless
leave no way out for him
He'd be done for
Oh no! Give him a chance to back down
Won't cost you much then
Twenty dollars will do
Twenty dollars
How could it be so expensive?
I've helped over a dozen people
win their cases
Like you, they wanted mild letters
Also written a total of
six merciless ones
The result? Four were shot
The other two got life sentences
I only asked for $20
It's not expensive at all
All right then
Good, tell me your case
The Chief has four daughters
Which means he's not only
let his ancestors down
He's also violated family planning policy
He cannot have a son
So he takes his frustrations out on us
My husband merely commented
that the Chief was raising hens
But the Chief heard hens
and insisted it meant his daughters
For that, he kicked my husband and
hurt him grievously
We cannot tolerate
this travesty of justice
The Chief is guilty of attempted murder
He must be punished
to the fullest extension
Who wrote this for you?
I asked someone
Paid $20 for it
Why didn't you write it yourself?
Haven't you been to school?
Been through secondary school
Couldn't write anything like this
Officer Li has dealt with this already
Why come to us
Officer Li might have favored the Chief
I want the county government
to handle it
Then leave your material with us
According to Regulations
of Article 39
a decision will be made on your case
in five days
If you find the decision unsatisfactory
you can apply to a higher level
for a review
Within five days of receiving
the decision
Did you get that?
What it means is
You go home first, and
the county Public Security Bureau
gives you a decision in five days
If you're still unhappy
you can go to the higher-ups
Those in the city P.S.B, and
ask them to look into your case again
Decided that the public security
officer of said village
should help both parties make
self-criticisms
All concerned should aim at
achieving harmony and stability
and let minor differences stand
As for financial compensation
the said village authorities have
in the first mediation
made a sound proposal for settlement
Wang shantang pays the complainant's
medical bills and wages lost
The same as the last decision
All that way to the county town for this
Ha! Thought I'd get a bullet in my head
Don't gloat
Officer Li, is that all
Get the meat first
There's one other thing
All right
Give me the meat
How much
Five dollars
Officer Li
Come to my place for a drink
and we can talk
No
Listen
T ake my advice
Go and say a few kink words
to Qinglai and Qiu Ju
and bring an end to the whole thing
Kind words
How kinds? What words?
Look, you must do your part
I came several times
just for this case
You've heard the decision of
the county town
You won't lose face
T ell me, Office Li
why couldn't this have been settled here
Why go to the county town
to smear my name
She didn't mean you harm
Besides, I'm an official
I've still got to run this place
She didn't mean harm
Just wants you to apologize
Go on say a few words and
she'll be pacified
I'll cough up the money
As for apologizing
I can't see that I'm wrong
There you go again
Decided that the public security
officer of said village
should help both parties
make self-criticisms
All concerned should aim at
achieving harmony and stability
and let minor differences stand
As for financial compensation
the said village authorities have
at the first attempt at mediation
made a sound proposal for settlement
Wang Shantang pays the complainant's
medical bills and wage loss
That's it. see what you think
Isn't this the same as the last decisions?
Let's eat first
Meizi, set the table
What're you having? Noodles
That's worth good money
Dad, the noodles are ready
You're a busy man
Haven't seen you in a while
How are you? You look well
I'm well. I fell fine.
Qinglai, you look better
Y es. Just got this lump in my chest
and not much energy
That's because you feel wronged
Relax and you'll be all right
You're still young
See how you like the taste
Eat. T ell me if its too bland
Wang Shantang is stubborn
Everyone in the village knows it
He asked me to bring you these
Its not easy for him to make this gesture
Qiu Ju, you said you wanted him
to do right
T ake this as an apology from him
Help yourself
You'll be fully compensated
Your expenses paid
So you haven't suffered financially
Besides, this is a case for mediation
Not one to be settled in court
The county town made a decision
and that's it
Officer Li, did he really pay for this
Come on
Who else
I spent half the day yesterday
persuading him
He is, after all, an officer
Don't be too hard on him
Sending you the snacks
is his way of saying sorry to you
If that's the case
all's well then
After all, he's the Chief
what can I do to him
We all live in the same village
No point dragging this out
The county town has made decision
so be it
I'm no comment
Y es, if that's their decision
And if that's the case
Then the Chief has already
apologized to us
As for the money, it's not important
That's your compensation
he should pay for it
Very well, then
let's consider it settled
I haven't come all this way
for nothing
You two go and sit at the back
There's a line, don't you see
There are lots of marriage
applicants today
Go and get in line
How did you two fall in love?
Where did you first meet?
At my place
Was it love at first sight then
Did you fall for her right away?
Y es
And you? Do you love him?
Miss, did you propose to him?
He proposed to you. What did you say?
Y es
Say it aloud then. Or
how can I give you this
What if tomorrow you don't want him?
So it was love at first sight
Li
Qiu Ju asked me
to bring these back to you
Once you sign this
It's love for life
Hey, Wan
Come warm yourself first
Your turn next. Get ready
Why did you bring these back to me?
What's up
Qiu Ju said the Chief didn't buy them
You did
How did she know?
The shopkeeper told her
So what? What's the big deal?
You shouldn't have wasted your money
She's as pigheaded as the Chief
This has dragged on too long
I want it to end
A silly squabble, don't you think?
Qiu Ju said she wanted an explanation
This daughter-in-law of yours
Where is she
Gone to the city with Meizi
The City
Hey, where you want to go
Comrade
Any cheap hotels round here
Hotels? Y eah, sure
Hop in, I'll take you
How much
Forty-five dollars
Forty-five dollars
T oo much? What can $45 get you now
Besides, mine's a three-wheeler
Jump in, I'll take you
It's a nice ride
As good as a sight-seeing tour
I won't even charge you for that
Still, it's too expensive
All right, I see you're
from the countryside
It isn't easy for you to get here
I'll be the martyr $30 will do
Come on, give me your bag
Well then, let's go
Are we there? Y es
Meizi, the bag
Thirty dollars. Right
Comrade
a cheap hotels round here
This one's cheap
Is there another one that's cheaper?
Y eah, the cheapest in town
Straight ahead, just round the corner
I see
How much did that man charge you?
Thirty dollars
From where
The bus station
The bus station? No more than $5 worth
It seemed far
Crooks they are
They pick the longest route
Just want to rip you off
From the countryside
Y es
Better get some other clothes
Why
You don't change your clothes
you'll be an easy target
Crooks like to go after country folk
Need a room
Is it cheap?
Y es, yes. Come look
It's neat and tidy
How much for one night
You want a receipt
Receipt
If you want a receipt
it's $6 per night
You pay $4 yourself
When you've been reimbursed
you pocket the deference
If no receipt, it's $4 per night
Anything cheaper
There's the communal brick bed
$1.50 a night
Good, I'll take that
You've come to make a complaint
How did you know?
The PSB is just round the corner
Country folk who've come to make
a complaint all stay here
Over the years I've seen quite
a few cases
If you need help on legal matters
Just ask
I see
Do I have to pay
No, it's free
I had someone write a complaint letter
for me
Cost me $20
Meizi, have you seen the reply letter?
No
I don't see what's wrong
You don't
He still hasn't done right by us
What d'you want to do now
They told me that
If I'm not happy with the decision
I could ask the city PSB
to review my case
I'm going tomorrow and ask for a review
You might as well forget it
Just think: a million people
in the city
if one out of a hundred has a dispute
it comes to ten thousand disputes
T o you, this is a big deal
T o them, it's nothing
Hey, you got a room
Go have a look
If that's the case
I've come all this way for nothing
You're due soon, right
First month of the lunar year
Sister, you want to wash
Later, you go ahead
Must be hard coming so far
I'll tell you what you do
Go and talk to the director
of the PSB here
He's a good man
This is his address
Go and talk to him
Don't get me wrong
I'm not trying to keep you here
After all, I only charge you
$1.50 per night
But in your condition
I want to help you
Don't tell anyone else
I'll give you his address
Over there
Meizi
we're going to see the director
What should we take
Let's take him some snacks
City people don't like plain things
What, then
Fruit
