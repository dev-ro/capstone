[mysterious music playing]
[rain pattering]
[singer vocalizing]
[woman] She was really strange.
Hidden like a crime...
yet as evident as a virtue,
and sometimes as absurd as fate.
You know, she would often stretch
the sleeves of her pullover
and nestle her hands in its warmth.
She would sneeze
not once or twice but thrice.
Right in the center of the little dip
between her collarbones,
she had a beautiful black spot.
A mole.
{\an8}In fact, there was another mole
in our lives.
One that neither I had any inkling of
nor did Octopus.
- [music fades]
- [indistinct chatter]
[machine beeping]
No.
[both] Madam, you can't take this inside.
Then I'm not going inside either.
[indistinct chatter]
[traditional Indian music playing]
[man singing in Hindi]
Heena.
[in English] A very happy birthday,
Mirza sahib.
You look gorgeous tonight.
You're a liar.
[clicks tongue] No. Really.
[man singing in Hindi]
[in English] I'm so sorry.
Your guards have
totally ruined the gift wrapping.
[winces, tuts]
I am sorry.
I promise, I will kill all of them.
- Salaam alaikum.
- Walaikum salaam.
After you, please.
- Hello, sir.
- Two whiskeys on the rocks.
Sure, sir.
Wow.
It's, uh... It's my favorite perfume.
How did you know this?
It's a magical fragrance
that has captivated my senses
for a long time.
You're a liar.
A better liar than you are.
[bartender] Excuse me, sir.
[sighs] I'm sorry. I'll be right back.
Hello.
Your whiskey on the rocks, ma'am.
[suspenseful music playing]
Excuse me.
Um, you already seem
to be wearing a perfume.
Maybe you should save this
for later, Mirza sahib.
Because you want me to die alone, hmm?
And imagine if I spray this perfume
right now over here,
you will also die along with me,
isn't that right?
[women gasp, scream]
Octopus.
- [music fades]
- What happened?
The party is still on, my friends.
Play the music, please.
- [traditional Indian music playing]
- [man singing in Hindi]
[in English] Enjoy. Enjoy.
{\an8}[music stops abruptly]
{\an8}[mellow music playing]
{\an8}Mr. Handa, any update?
[tense music playing]
- KM, you're still here?
- [Handa grunts]
[yelps, grunts]
- KM!
- Let go of me, Kutty!
- [Kutty] KM, stop. He'll die.
- [KM] Kutty.
- [Kutty] Stop it.
- [grunts]
Everyone's watching. That's enough.
- [KM] Leave me, Kutty, I'm telling you!
- KM!
- [man groans]
- Hey! Handa. Handa, what happened?
- Take him to the dispensary.
- Okay.
- [Jeev] Quick.
- Right this way.
KM, what the hell
do you think you're doing, huh?
- [breathes shakily]
- [somber music playing]
You killed her.
You...
Jeev, sir, there is some bad news.
It's not me.
It's you who killed her.
{\an8}[music fades]
Ma'am, there's a girl here to meet you.
Just tell her that I'm busy.
Ma'am, she told me if you say
that you are busy, I should say to you...
[in Hindi] "What's wrong with you,
my foolish heart?"
[in English] Please, take a seat.
Thank you.
Salaam alaikum.
I would like to work for you.
Sorry?
I have connections everywhere.
NSI, Jamat.
I'm really sorry
but I think you're mistaken.
I'm a counselor here.
I know exactly who you are... Krishna Mehra.
But in our world, you're known as KM.
Smart. "Krishna Mehra is KM."
Shabbir told me about you.
He said you're not stingy
like the last officer.
You pay well.
I don't know anyone called Shabbir.
Well, Shabbir isn't Shabbir either.
He hasn't ever told you
his real name, right?
Will you tell me yours?
Heena. Heena Rehman.
I work in the Accounts Department
at the NSI.
Okay, Heena. Heena Rehman.
Nice meeting you.
[mysterious music playing]
This is Brigadier Mirza's
movement schedule for the next 15 days.
I know for a fact
that your team has been following him.
[clears throat]
[music fades]
[Heena grunts]
[soft song playing over the radio]
[Heena sneezes repeatedly]
Sorry. Sorry.
I always sneeze three times, you know?
Excuse me. [sniffles]
Frisk me?
[turns up the volume]
Why exactly are you doing this?
I hate Mirza.
It's almost as if he wants
to take us back to the Stone Age.
He's the ISI's errand boy.
And?
I need money for my father's treatment.
I will not be able to recruit you.
Why?
We're not supposed to trust walk-ins.
But do you have a choice?
You don't, right?
Multiple.
[laughs]
Oh! "Multiple"?
Mirza has been
killing your people one by one
and you're doing nothing about it.
Have you forgotten the 814 hijack?
If you don't have an answer in three days,
all your people
will be sent off to Beijing.
You know, I have three answers for you.
You just need to ask me the question...
KM.
[reporter] Police officials
are investigating
what seems to be
a coordinated triple blast
in the offices of Jamat
in Dhaka, Chittagong, and Rajshahi.
As the video shows, this entire building
in Dhaka has been demolished
and the exact number of casualties...
- [telephone beeping]
- ...is unknown,
even though initial estimates
are putting it above 100.
We have a video from the Jamat...
How did you like my hat trick?
[reporter] In Chittagong, we have...
Do I consider myself recruited now, KM?
[doorbell dings]
I'm not at home.
You are home but you're not yourself.
KM, I need you.
Really?
You're the only one I trust.
Bullshit.
You fucking sent her on a suicide mission...
No.
...and didn't tell me.
[Hindi song playing on the radio]
KM, this wasn't a suicide mission.
We had an evacuation plan in place...
but somebody betrayed us.
We have a mole in the agency.
[upbeat music playing]
[Jeev] Ravi Mohan, he's our prime suspect.
Routine surveillance reveals that
his lifestyle doesn't match his salary.
[giggles]
Fucking snorted.
[camera shutter clicks]
[Jeev] To confirm our doubt,
we bypassed all the norms
and rules of the agency
and decided to bug his office.
[lock clicks]
Good morning, sir.
[upbeat music continues]
- [snores]
- [music fades]
[cuckoos and bells clanging]
{\an8}[suspenseful music playing]
[Jeev] And we found that we were right.
[photocopier beeps]
[Jeev] He makes copies
of top-secret documents
and takes them out of the office.
Goodnight, sir.
Bye.
[Jeev] We even kept his family
under surveillance.
Charu, I'm leaving, beta.
Don't forget your umbrella.
I've got it. I've got it, dear.
[Jeev] We suspect that his wife
is equally involved in this conspiracy
and maybe she's the one
who works as a courier for him.
- Did you have a fight?
- No, I didn't fight.
[Jeev] She regularly takes her son
to the Zaire Club after school for a swim.
The Zaire Club is always full
of foreign diplomats.
It's an ideal place for delivering it.
And she's quite friendly,
especially with the diplomats
of the Pakistani embassy.
And just the day before Operation Octopus,
Ravi went to a shady theater in Paharganj.
[intense music playing over speakers]
[people exclaim]
- [speaking in Hindi]
- [in English] You mean The Matrix?
- [man] Ms. Chandni... Sorry.
- [woman] Oh.
[speaking in Hindi]
[in English] No thank you, I'll...
[suspenseful music playing]
[man speaking in Hindi]
[upbeat music playing]
[motorbikes revving]
[in English] Triple two, triple seven,
double three, eight.
Yes. Tell me, Ma, how are you?
- Double three, three, eight, triple five...
- [man] Yeah, I'm fine.
...double two.
- Yeah.
- [man] Hmm.
[man] Okay.
Bye, sir.
- Okay.
- [man] Okay. Okay.
Yes, Damini's fine as well.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Fine. I'll call you back, all right?
Excuse me. Money?
[upbeat music continues]
[both grunt]
[music intensifies]
[man grunts]
- [grunts]
- [brakes screeching]
Ah! [pants]
- [man 1] Someone call the police.
- [man 2] Should we call for an ambulance?
Is he a friend of yours?
[suspenseful music playing]
[Jeev] The message was coded.
By the time we decoded it,
it was too late.
What was the message?
"Perfume bottle."
Why haven't you arrested him yet?
Come on, KM.
Ravi's just a puppet.
He's only a pawn. Nothing else.
And in our game, the puppeteer
is more important than the puppet.
There are so many officers in the agency.
Why come to me?
I owe you this opportunity.
"Opportunity"?
Now?
For what?
To avenge Octopus.
Power has the ability
to turn an angel into a demon.
And once he acquires the right
to this absolute power,
even he cannot escape this curse.
Imagine that he is like an egg
of a venomous snake.
If it is allowed to hatch, it will strike.
So before the snake slithers out
of its hole,
we have to crush it to death.
[indistinct chatter]
- [man] Good job.
- [Vikram] Thank you.
- [woman] You killed it.
- Well done, son.
Thank you, sir.
I'm so proud of you.
[KM] Viku!
Hey! [pants]
Is the play over?
Actually, it took me...
It took me forever
to drape this sari properly and...
and once I left home,
I had a flat tire.
Requested the watchman,
made him change the tire.
And, you know, I ran all the red lights
and crash-landed over here somehow.
And I was only ten minutes late
but these guys didn't let me in.
So sorry, Viku.
It's okay, Ma.
I'll just change and come back.
Okay.
So you learned how to drape a sari?
- Not at all.
- So then?
The old lady next door helped me.
I had no idea you are
into older women now.
- [laughs]
- Shut up.
Hey, Ma, that's enough.
- A little.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I won't be able to finish it.
- Okay. Fine. Fine.
Please.
Okay.
You look so beautiful in a sari, Ma.
- Hmm.
- You should wear it more often.
- Hmm, yup.
- Okay. [chuckles]
- Listen, Dad.
- [Shashank] Hmm?
- Can I ask you something?
- [Shashank] Hmm?
How could you let go of such a beauty?
It was a mistake, buddy.
[sentimental music playing]
Whose mistake?
[cell phone beeps]
I'm going to have to leave.
At least finish your dinner.
Something urgent has come up, Shashank.
- On a Sunday?
- [KM] Yes, on a Sunday.
[chuckles] Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry!
- Next to next Sunday...
- Hmm?
...this will be the last time
I'll be playing Brutus.
- Hmm.
- So don't make any excuses.
- No.
- Promise?
Pinky promise.
Are you sure? Don't be late, Ma, please.
[KM] Thousand percent.
- Everyone's here?
- Yes, ma'am.
[keypad beeps]
Sorry, sir.
In disguise?
Family dinner.
You've got permission to bug his house.
You will run the mission, hmm?
What should we call it?
- Brutus.
- "Brutus"?
Okay.
Operation Brutus will start tonight.
Let's get going.
[indistinct chatter]
How much, bhaiya?
Three...
Seventy rupees.
- Seventy.
- Okay.
[suspenseful music playing]
Uh, you can take the change tomorrow.
Portia has left the building.
But Julius Caesar hasn't arrived yet.
[scooter horn honks]
- Where were you, Paaji?
- Just please don't ask, okay?
What's the time?
Your watch isn't working?
We've been waiting for you
since the last ten minutes.
- So?
- Paaji. Just let it go, Paaji.
What? Let it go?
Three months ago,
I had applied for this leave.
My daughter has come
especially from the US.
We had kept a prayer at the gurudwara!
I had to leave halfway through it.
- Paaji, this is not the time to argue.
- Come on. Let's just go.
[suspenseful music playing]
[door creaks open]
[music intensifies]
- [music fades]
- [indistinct chatter]
How is my boy?
- Hey, looks like you have a fever.
- Fever?
No swimming today. Let's go.
- No, Mommy.
- No!
[suspenseful music resumes]
[fingers snapping]
- Kutty, sir? Portia.
- What?
KM, Portia is back.
Oh, fuck! She's coming back.
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!
Everyone, hurry up.
[music intensifies]
Hey, are you done? Leave.
Go! Come on, come on, come on, come on!
And then you jumped into the pool, right,
after you had ice cream?
- [Kunal] Yeah.
- Hmm.
Hey.
Why are you so slow?
- And what are you doing there?
- Kunal, just wait.
Jubin! Jubin, leave it. Just go.
- You leave, you leave! Right now!
- Sorry, ma'am. Sorry.
Mama, make ice cream for me today, okay?
Slow down.
And no ice cream.
Mama, open the door.
[suspenseful music continues]
[Kunal] Please.
[music fades]
[Charu] Hey, Kunal.
Wait. Come here. Come here.
What is this?
[exhales]
[inhales] KM.
Hey, Chaacha. Good morning.
[doorbell rings]
Kunal?
Kunal, your tiffin is ready.
Kunal?
He's in the bedroom.
[Ravi] I heard them
and ran through the corridor.
- [Charu] Kunal?
- And as soon as...
- Shh.
- Shh
- [Ravi] And then...
- Hmm, then?
And before the three of them
could get to the guns, I got to them.
Pow! Pow! Pow! [groans]
[Kunal chuckles]
That same night,
I came back to Delhi to see you.
Even today in Islamabad...
it's Mashkoor Ali they're looking for.
[all laugh]
- [horn honks]
- [gasps] Kunal, time to go.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Come on. Come on, tiger.
Your bus is already here.
Come on. Go.
Go.
Faster, boy.
You forgot the inhaler!
Oh. Tiger, you go. I'm coming.
[suspenseful music playing]
Brutus is leaving.
[KM] I'm at the base.
You guys cover them.
Copy.
Hang on.
[music fades]
I'm going in for the satsang.
Yeah. You definitely need it.

From a store.
Ravi, where is this money
coming from, huh?
I'm spying for another country.
[Charu] Please.
First, it was the diamond earrings.
Now, this necklace.
Tell me the truth.
[Ravi] Truth.
Truth is I led a successful operation.
So?
- So, R&AW chief always has...
- Hmm?
...thousands of crores of rupees.
[Ravi] I got a reward today.
[chuckles]
- What was the operation?
- That's a secret.
- How much is it for?
- That is top secret.
Mm. Tell me, Ravi.
[Ravi's mother] Ravi? You're back.
Yes, Ma.
Sorry.

Leave it, Amma.

Files. Found them.

You tell me, what do you want?
Forget about me.
Go get yourself a brain first.
What an idiot you are.
- When is the delivery?
- Tomorrow.

- Hmm.
And a middleman
for a European arms company
after he retired.
Till he wasn't alive, he was part
of every arms deal of the country.
She's trained under him.
Sir, should I send a memo
to the defense secretary?
For what?
To change the coordinates
of the local assets.
No, no, no.
This will raise a red flag
for his handlers.

We will have him before that.

[Jeev] Pause.
At exactly 6:15 p.m.,
he entered the compound with the car.
Play.
Forward.
Stop.
Check the time now.
6:20 p.m.
It takes him one minute to walk home
from his car every day.
However, every Monday...
Around five minutes.
Yeah, I remember last time,
it took him a while to get home.
Not a while.
Precisely four extra minutes.
Where does he spend
those four extra minutes?
Rewind.
Stop.
Increase the volume.
Play.
[creaking]
Stop.
What is this sound?
Come.
Between the house and the driveway,
there's a small door
which opens into the garage.
[creaks]
The sound is made by that door.
Every day Ravi parks his car
and takes the stairs to go home.
But only on Mondays,
first, he goes into the garage,
and only after that, he comes home.
What does he do
for those four minutes in the garage?
The answer to that question
is parked inside this garage.
[thrilling music playing]
Today is Sunday.
Before Monday evening,
I need a camera in there.
When his wife takes the kid to the club,
we'll go in.
The pool is closed on Mondays
for cleaning.
She's going to be home all day.
Then?
We'll have to take a chance.
I need eyes in the garage.

Michael.
[music intensifies]
[Michael] Hello, Chaacha. How are you?
Madam, it doesn't look good.
How bad is it?
There's a pool of blood.
- [walkie-talkie beeps]
- Kutty, what's your status?
Just finished.
Help Michael get Portia out.
I'm coming.
KM, please don't.
It's an order, Kutty.
- Careful. Careful.
- Call for Chaacha.
Chaacha, please help us!
Come on! Help us! Hurry up!
- [man] What happened to madam?
- [Kutty] She's bleeding.
- We have to take her to a hospital.
- I think she fell down the stairs.
Let's go.
- She's bleeding.
- Be careful.
- Just be careful, okay?
- Careful, careful.
[overlapping chatter]
- Okay.
- Come on. Hurry up.
Come on. Go.
Hey! Which hospital are you taking her to?
- [music fades]
- [telephone rings]
Hello?
[intense music playing]
[music fades]
[Ravi] My whole life flashed
before my eyes
on the way to the hospital
from the office.
You remember where I met you
for the first time, huh?
At the army mess, New Year's Eve.
No.
That's what I thought too.
I don't know why, out of the blue,
I had a flash of an image today.
I went to the railway station
to pick up Amma.
I think you had come
to Dehradun from Delhi
with Brigadier Yusef the same day.
Shatabdi Express.
You were wearing a...
green top...
blue jeans.
Hey, Ravi.
[Ravi sobs]
[Charu] Please.
I'm absolutely fine, huh?
Hey.
You're talking as if the doctor said
your wife is broken, you need a new one.
[chuckles]
Here you go.
Where is he?
[cell phone rings]
[somber music playing]
[KM] She's innocent, sir.
And I'm stupid.
You almost fucked up the operation.
- She could have died.
- [Jeev] So?
In our line of work,
we think from the head, not the heart.
And, by the way, I know you've been
sending money to Dhaka...
- for Octopus' father...
- Jeev. Listen, we're getting late.
Let's go.
Do you know what will happen
if the Chief finds out?
[knocking on door]
Viku, come on. Open the door, please.
Viks.
I was in the bathroom, Ma.
How was the show?
[Vikram] How it always is, boring.
Baba, it was an emergency.
It's always been an emergency, Ma.
All right.
I'm very, very, very, very sorry.
[strums guitar]
Aren't you sick and tired
of apologizing all the time?
♪ And you know what, Ma ♪
♪ You are a liar ♪
♪ A big, big liar... ♪
Vikram, what are you saying?
Really?
Okay.
Tell me about where you work.
Capital Secretariat, huh?
What the fuck is Capital Secretariat?
Language, Vikram.
Okay.
At least tell me this...
why did you guys get divorced?
That's none of your business.
[Vikram] Cat got your tongue?
Ma, when you find the courage
to tell me the truth,
that's when we'll talk.
[guitar playing]
[birds chirping]
[door creaks]
[suspenseful music playing]
[KM] Zoom in, Kutty. Zoom in.
[music intensifies]
[lawnmower whirring]
What did I say?
- The car.
- [Ravi] Hmm?
Let's go, huh?
[lawnmower whirring]
[lawnmower whirring stops]
[foreboding music playing]

[KM] Black Bike, DL-2134.

The foundation for a historic
Indo-US nuclear cooperation deal
has been laid today.
Representatives of both the governments
are present here today
at Vigyan Bhawan.
She learned how to tie a sari.
It's true. I did. I did. I did.
It took me some time, but I...
What says you, milady?
[all laughing]
That was very cheeky.
- He's coming.
- Uh-hmm.
- Sir.
- Sir.
What are you two doing here?
Sir, we found the puppeteer...
[ominous music playing]
...and both the puppets.
Both?
This time we took some extra precautions.
This time our team only had
the information of the weapon
that was to be used, the perfume bottle.
The target, the asset, and the date
were shared only with four people.
You, me, the Chief, and...
And?
The PM.
Do you realize what you're saying?
Sir, if you have figured it out,
I must definitely know.
The CIA have definite intel
that R&AW are planning
something big in Dhaka.
We are luring Islamabad
to give us Osama Bin Laden.
If your operation, in any manner,
offends the ISI,
which I'm sure it will,
then you indirectly jeopardize
our mission.
You have a mole in R&AW?
[laughs] What?
No, sir.
Oh, my God.
It's the CIA who has gifted our assets
to ISI in Colombo, Cairo, and Istanbul.
Why betray us?
In exchange for what?
Mishra ji, you are completely mistaken.
Ah... the heads of Al Qaeda's Shura.
The drone attacks.
Since Jamat came to power,
Bangladesh has practically
been run by the ISI.
Do you have any idea
how badly it has hurt India?
Again, sir, I have no clue
about any of this.
That's Brigadier Mirza
with Ibrahim Athar,
brother of Maulana Masood Azhar,
planner of the IC 814 hijack.
Let's...
Let's meet some other day,
I'm heading out to meet the PM.
Washington will not hesitate in
calling off the nuclear deal with India.
I'm so sorry, Mishra ji...
but I am just the messenger.
[Mishra ji] The nuclear deal
was more important
for the nation than Mirza.
Why didn't you share this with us?
We could have protected our asset.
You couldn't have saved Octopus.
To win Mirza's trust,
the CIA wanted us to sacrifice Octopus.
Excuse me, sir.
Shameful.
[beeps]
[photocopier whirring]
[tense music playing]
Okay.
So half the cross is now ready.
Let's catch them red-handed tomorrow,
puppet and puppeteer both.
[glasses clink]
- [sighs] Michael?
- [Michael] Hmm?
Your turn.
What time is it?
Five minutes past my shift.
[light buzzes]
[suspenseful music playing]
[water dripping]
[suspenseful music continues]
Guess what I've made today?
Hint.
- That's nice.
- [chuckles]
Go and freshen up. Surprise dinner.
[music intensifies]
[music fades]
Looks like your time is up, Ravi baboo.
[thunder rumbles]
[dramatic music playing]
[music fades]
Leg piece?
You know I eat veg on Tuesdays.
Stop acting like you give a damn.
It's going to be Wednesday soon.
Have it.
What's wrong?
Hmm?
[suspenseful music playing]
- [gunshot]
- Michael!
[gunshots]
[dramatic music playing]
[rain pattering]
[music fades]
Turn the light off. Turn the light off.
What are you doing, huh?
Just pack a few clothes
and whatever you can grab.
Only important stuff.
We have to leave in 15 minutes, Cha.
- Where are we going, Ravi?
- [Ravi] I don't know.
What did you do? Did you kill someone?
Come on. Hurry up, beta.
You'll have enough time
to ask these questions later.
Ravi, what's going on?
- Tell me, who did you kill?
- No one.
Where are we going?
When are we coming back?
I don't know. Maybe never.
Don't forget to pack
some warm clothes for Kunal.
Come on. Hurry up, you two.
You just keep an eye on the balcony.
The embassy's sending a guard.
Embassy? Which embassy, huh?
What's going on?
[tense music playing]
Cha. Cha, do you love me?
You love me, then trust me.
Just start packing. Please.
[Charu] Listen to me. Ravi!
- I have the right to know.
- [door closes]
[breathes shakily]
Ravi...
are you betraying your country?
[tense music continues]
[music fades]
I'm helping America
fight against the Taliban.
- Why?
- [Ravi] Because...
if the Taliban is driven out
of Afghanistan,
which country benefits the most, hmm?
India does.
But the bosses of our glorious agency
just don't get it. They don't understand.
And I tried. I really tried.
I tried to do it the right way.
But I... But I failed, Charu.
So, yes, maybe I think steps ahead
of my country and that's my crime,
but I'm not a traitor,
I'm a fucking patriot.
I...
- [somber music playing]
- [chuckles]
Now I know.
Those diamond earrings,
those necklaces, where they all came from.
[chuckles]
[Ravi] Huh?
No. No. You're mistake...
Please, I'm begging of you.
There's no time, my love.
Just go and pack. Please.
Please. I'll... I'll explain.
I'm from a family of soldiers.
I won't betray my country ever.
[suspenseful music playing]
Cha, please.
[Ravi's mother] Ravi.
The car is here, beta.
[whimpering] Please. Please.
Enough of this drama. Can we leave now?
[Ravi] Please. Please. Please...
I'm not going anywhere.
[Ravi's mother] All right.
Let her die over here.
Just go and get Kunal.
Come on now. Come on. Hurry up.
You can't take Kunal away from me!
[sobs] You don't take Kunal.
- [Ravi] Please.
- Don't do this to me, Ravi, please.
Don't take Kunal away from me.
Come with us.
I love you, Charu.
- Please.
- Kunal.
- [groans]
- [Ravi] What... What are you doing?
Cha. Cha. She's bleeding.
She's bleeding.
She's bleeding, bleeding...
Calm down. Come on, Cha.
Just keep your head straight.
- Cha. Please. Cha.
- [screams] Kunal!
- [Ravi] Cha, please listen to me.
- No!
- We won't go anywhere. We...
- Kunal! Kunal!
[Ravi] Please, just listen to me.
We won't go anywhere, we won't go.
- [Charu screams]
- [Ravi] We won't, we won't.
Cha, please. We won't go anywhere.
We won't... We won't go. [groans]

Amma! No!
Amma...

[man] Got this yesterday from the UN.
And?
The usual.
The same thing the US Embassy
and all human rights societies say,
"We can understand your pain
but we can't do anything about it."
If you separate even an animal
from its mother,
the mother will just...
lose its mind.

[sobs softly]

[thrilling music playing]
[music fades]
[KM] Somehow I manage
to mess everything up.
Professionally...
personally...
everything.
You know what?
You expect too much from yourself.
Every time something goes wrong,
you seem to blame yourself.
Been seeing you since college.
You have been on the move. Just running.
You feel like the sun won't rise
if you wake up late
and the moon will disappear
if you sleep early.
[chuckles softly]
Krishna, just pause a bit, slow down...
and understand one thing.
If you quit this job, you will die.
[chuckles, sniffles]
Maybe it's for the better.
There's nothing left to live for.
- Bill.
- Hmm?
[Shashank] I'll take care of it.
[KM] I'll see you in the parking lot.
[tense music playing]
I need your help.
Excuse me?
Sorry. Do I know you?
Maybe a little more than you should.
I'm sorry. I think you're mistaken.
Sorry.
Listen.
Just listen to what I have to say.
One minute.
Just one minute.
Hear me out.
I have come here to help you out.
He didn't just betray me.
He betrayed the whole country.
I want my son back.
Please. [sobs]
[sobs]
- [music fades]
- [boy] Balloons. Buy some balloons.
One for five, three for ten.
Buy some balloons.
Didi, buy some balloons.
Buy one, Didi. I haven't sold even one.
I am very hungry, Didi. Buy one.
Please buy one, Didi. Please.
Buy one, Didi.
Please.
[indistinct chatter]
Didi, balloons.
You will need them in America, Didi.

[in English] Yaara ji, it's very tough.
It's a new country, strange people.
Neither is the language ours
nor is the culture.
It's very difficult.
Doing household chores
in my old age, left all alone.
[sobs] Look at this.
My fingers are bruised
doing all the dirty dishes.
There must be some solution, Yaara ji.
There has to be something.
Please tell me. [sobs]
There is, Lalita. There is.
There is a way.
Look there.
What?
[screams]
- [screams]
- Maa ji. Maa ji, please forgive me.
Maa ji, forgive me.
Yaara ji, what is she doing here? [cries]
Maa ji, I know for a fact
you can forget how to breathe
but you can never miss
Yaara ji's satsang.
- [screams]
- Maa ji, Maa ji.
- Maa ji, maa ji... [sobs]
- [screams] Yaara ji.
Yaara ji...
what if she's... she's been...
What if she's been planted here
by the agency people?
She's been in my ashram for months.
I've done a complete
background check on her.
- She's clean.
- But, Yaara ji...
Look, Lalita, if you think
your faith is dwindling,
then don't accept her.
[phone rings]
Yaara ji?
I've done my bit.
Now ask your fucking bosses
to release my accounts.
Will be done.
[dramatic music playing]
[dog barking]
[foreboding music playing]
Come in, beta. Come in.
You realize the value of your country
when you go and live abroad.
Dishes, dusting, cleaning,
you have to do everything yourself.
Give it to me, Maa ji. I'll do it.
And it's time for your nap, isn't it?
Please get some rest.
You still remember the time for my nap?
Listen.
May I say something?
Will you believe what I tell you?
Sure.
That night... I pulled the trigger
of that pistol by mistake.
It wasn't really my intention to kill you.
I know, Maa ji.
[whimpers]
I can die peacefully now.
Maa ji, please don't say those things.
My poor child. [sobs]
Are Ravi and Kunal here?
Kunal has a meeting with his counselor.
They must be heading home.
Counselor?
Is he all right, Maa ji?
He will be now, since you are here.
[doorbell rings]
[Ravi] Right?
- Mama!
- [gasps]
- Where were you?
- [sobs]
[sobs]
[melodramatic music playing]
- [sobs]
- [Kunal] Mom!
How are you?
[breathes shakily] I'm not okay.
[sobs]
[neighbor] Hey, Sid.
- You always forget your bag.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.
[speaks in Farsi]
[in English] Phone.
Why didn't you call me, Mama?
I did. Couldn't get through.
- No. Did somebody follow you?
- No.
Are you sure, Mama?
Hundred percent sure.
I have to inform the CIA.
- I cannot...
- No, no, no.
No, no, no. Not at all.
Until our papers are legalized,
you cannot do anything like that.
The CIA are cruel.
They will not only deport that poor girl,
but also end up sending us to Antigua
or Cuba or someplace like that.
And?
Look, think of it like this.
That we have found ourselves,
free of cost,
a maid who will do
all the household chores.
Huh?
That Iranian has seen everything.
Do you get it? And he's met her.
So if I don't tell them,
he'll go straight to the CIA.
The man himself has brought along
a whole town from Iran.
Who would understand
if he doesn't understand?
I cannot take a chance.
I cannot!
Ravi, please do us a favor.
Have pity on me and on yourself.
Look, I can't do anymore cooking
and cleaning. That's...
We'll just keep a maid, Amma.
You want to keep a maid?
You can't even afford dinner
and you're talking of keeping a maid!
You don't have a proper job,
no sign of any real income.
And these unforgiving winters.
My God. Isn't your CIA generous?
My CIA? My CIA, huh?
Whose idea was it to spy with them?
Whose idea?
- [Ravi's mother] Oh, really?
- We have become fugitives because of you.
Is that so?
So now it's all my fault, right? Huh?
Have you forgotten your bullshit?
- Parties every day.
- Stop.
Armani suits.
- All those new cars.
- [Ravi] Shut up.
- Single malt.
- [Ravi] Shut up.
And stop bringing up
the single malt all the time, Amma.
Daddy's at it again.
Do one thing. Get a needle and thread
and just sew my lips shut.
Come on. Shut me up.
Why don't you understand? Please.
- Don't... Stop doing this.
- [whimpers]
Listen, Yaara ji has said she is clean.
Oh, what if...
What if Yaara ji has been recruited
by the agency as well, then?
What are you going to do then?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
- You're doubting Yaara ji? How dare you?
- No.
I'm not doubting Yaara ji at all.
But this is very strange, Amma.
Just think for a second.
From across the globe, alone.
That done all by herself.
She set out to find us and found us.
She found us.
That too, in South Dakota!
How? How can you believe this shit?
I'm a mother, that's why.
And I can understand a mother's pain.
To reunite with her lost child,
a mother can and will go to any length.
Exactly.
That's what I'm trying to say.
Now do you get it?
- Mommy?
- Hmm?
Do you know all our names have changed?
Now, I'm Siddharth Singh.
Papa is Robin Singh.
And Dadi is Sarita.
We will have to change yours too, right?
Hmm, what should it be?
Hmm, Karishma?
Kareena?
Madhuri! Madhuri Singh!
- You like the name?
- Siddharth.
Siddharth, beta.
Come on. Go to your dadi.
- But I want to stay here with Mommy.
- Hmm.
I'm right here, Kunal. Come on.
[Ravi] Mommy is not going anywhere, okay?
[Kunal] Sarita? Where are you, Sarita?
I'm so happy you came back, Charu.
I never thought that...
I never even had the courage
to imagine you'd come back.
But you're here and I... I'm really happy.
The CIA is not happy with us.
Yeah, they're really upset with us.
- And?
- They want to take your interview.
It's just, um, procedure
and, um, it will all happen.
They have to do their job.
[dramatic music playing]
[KM] The success of this mission
completely depends on how well you manage
to hide your truth and evade detection.
Remember, you will always have
to be one step ahead of them.
[suspenseful music playing]
[KM] It's not legally possible
to extradite them anymore
because their names, personalities,
identities, everything has been changed.
That's why it's going to be
a long-drawn operation.
There's only one way now
to bring the traitor back home.
The puppet and the puppeteer
have to be caught in the act on stage.
When did you arrive in the United States?
9th November.
And, uh, how did you book your hotels
in all the cities?
Travel agent.
Name of the travel agency?
Uh, Travel Essence.
What was the name of the first hotel
that you stayed in?
Holiday Inn, LA.
If you act so confident,
they'll be on to you in no time.
They'll know that you've been trained
to beat the machine.
- Hotel?
- You heard right.
I... I don't remember.
I think it was, uh, Park Inn.
No. Uh, Holiday Inn.
[David] She seems clean.
But we're gonna have to verify
every detail of her story.
Until we do, she remains a serious risk
to you as well as to us.
I just want my family back, Doctor.
Of course you do.
Yeah.
But this is going to significantly delay
your citizenship processing.
Why?
Look, uh, as of now,
you don't exist in the United States.
And we can't jeopardize our position
until we're certain
that what she's telling us is the truth.
Okay. I'll wait.
How long will this take?
Until her tourist visa expires
and like you,
she becomes a refugee
in the United States.
In the meantime, we need to be careful.
[Ravi's mother] When Yaara ji said
that she is clean, then she is...
clean.
We have to be cautious.
We can't take a chance.
If there's even a hint of suspicion,
we have to tell the CIA.
- [Ravi's mother] What is this?
- [Ravi] Surveillance cameras.
Just send her off to do
some grocery shopping tomorrow.
All right?
And while she's gone,
we will set these up all around the house.
[suspenseful music playing]
- [alarm clock ringing]
- [gasps]
[upbeat music playing]
- [Charu] Mm, mm.
- [Kunal giggles]
[radio presenter] And now, let's tune in
to some Bollywood music from the '70s.
[Hindi song playing]
[music stops]
Hi, my name is Robin.
- How can I help you?
- [man] We'll have some popcorn, please.
Right. Anything to go with popcorn?
- Maybe a water.
- Maybe a water. And for you?
- That's all. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
Okay. Thank you.
- [phone ringing]
- There you go.
Uh, I'll just be a second.
Hello?
Doctor?
Yeah, really?
Yes, that sound... That's great news.
Yeah, thank you.
Right, we're having popcorn!
Your daughter-in-law
has been given the clean sheet.
Really?
[Ravi] Mm-hmm.
[Ravi's mother]
It's all because of Yaara ji's blessings.
[Ravi]
Langley said get rid of the cameras,
enough of surveillance, live life.
[Ravi's mother chuckles] Thank God!
Thank you, Yaara ji.
Here, have something sweet.
[Ravi's mother] Mmm, sugar?
- [Ravi] Sugar-free. [chuckles]
- [Ravi's mother laughs]
[suspenseful music playing]
[moans]
[moans]
[moaning]
[silent scream]
[phone ringing]
- [phone ringing]
- [KM] Hello?
Where are you?
Listen, we'll contact you very soon.
No. I want to know right now.
Where are you calling from?
From home.
Listen, you're taking a huge risk.
It's just not safe to talk on the phone.
- If he wakes up...
- He won't wake up.
I mixed the medicine in his drink.
But you're not supposed to use it.
How much longer do I have to wait?
Do you have any idea
what I'm going through?
I am dying a slow death every day.
Look, you were warned about this,
that you're headed towards a dark place.
Nobody can say if you'll ever be able
to see the light of day.
But...
we can abort this mission anytime
and take you back safely.
And Kunal?
I can't live without him.
I understand your pain.
No, you don't!
You need to be a mother
to understand my pain.
I have a 19-year-old son.
And he hates my guts.
We all have our crosses to bear
and the pain that comes with it.
[Charu] You're married?
- Was.
- What do you mean?
- We're divorced now.
- Remarried?
- No.
- Why?
Lost her.
Her?
[Charu] How?
Your husband killed her.
[dramatic music playing]
[suspenseful music playing]
[telephone beeping]
You have been double-crossed, my dear.
She is working for the ISI.
Now pack your bags and come back to India.
And don't leave a trace behind.
[phone line trilling]
[man] Indian Embassy, namaskar.
How may I help you?
Could you please connect me
to Krishna Mehra?
[man] Miss Mehra has been transferred.
When?
Where?
[man] I'm sorry.
We're not allowed to share the details.
Anything else I can help you with?
No, thanks.
[man] Thank you. Have a nice day.
[car alarm beeps]
[melodramatic music playing]
You're a stain on my career, Heena.
I swear I never betrayed you, Krishna.
I joined the ISI only...
only to help you out.
I did it for you.
Of course, without even telling me.
I'm giving you 24 hours, leave for Dhaka.
Or you'll never be able to go back,
believe me.
[melodramatic music playing]
[suspenseful music playing]
[indistinct chatter]
[thrilling music playing]
Passport and ticket?
Your luggage is already here
from the hotel.
It has been kept in the car.
My officers will escort you
all the way to the aircraft.
Do not attempt to come back
to India again.
[Heena] This time,
Jamat will come to power.
If Mirza survives.
If you want,
I can neutralize Mirza for you.
[KM] She put her own life at stake
just to prove her loyalty towards me.
Codename Octopus.
The perfume bottle.
It contains an aerosol variant
of the VX nerve agent.
It's extremely lethal.
Operation is set for tonight.
Please keep me updated, Mirza sahib.
I'm extremely concerned for your safety.
I'm sorry.
Does your son know about this?
- No.
- His father hasn't told him?
He's a nice man.
He wants me to leave
my secret life behind
and tell him myself.
- [neighbor greets in Farsi]
- [gasps]
[neighbor, in English]
I have seen nothing.
I swear. Nothing.
You're talking to your family in India?
- Yes.
- Talk, talk.
- No, I'm done.
- Ah.
What are you doing so late in the night?
Ah.
Spying!
[chuckling]
You know the old Black man living
in the house across the street?
I don't feel good about him.
I see his car around wherever I go.
Just now, I saw someone
up there in the window
watching your house.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Did you tell Robin about this?
No. No, no.
But I think I will.
First thing tomorrow morning.
Enjoy your smoke.
- [speaks in Farsi]
- [in English] Good night.
- [tires screeching]
- [thuds]
[Charu] Fida!
[tense music playing]
No...
Fida!
Just let him die.
Let him die.
[Charu panting]
You won't survive if he makes it.
Go. Just go back.
Just go back home.
Everything is going to be fine.
- Just go.
- [whimpers]
[car revving]
[whimpers]
[sobbing]
[dramatic music playing]
[sobs]
Did she reply?
The message has still not delivered.
- Really?
- Yeah, since day before.
[suspenseful music playing]
[Kunal] Mommy, when are we going
to get some ice cream?
[Charu] That's what we
are going for, Kunu.
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.
[Kunal] Come on.
[suspenseful music playing]
I'm not here to stop you.
Just tell me where you're headed.
Embassy.
They'll have to take us back.
If this is what you wanted,
you could have just told me.
I don't trust you anymore.
- Really?
- Yeah.
A human being
is just flesh and bone for you guys.
An asset as long as
that person is useful,
and then a liability.
How do you people
sleep peacefully at night?
Why do you have to shed so much blood?
Your father was in the army, right?
You never asked him this question.
As long as the world is divided
into countries and religions...
this bloodshed is going to continue.
And we will all be responsible for it.
Not just me. You too.
The choice has always been yours.
It is still yours to make.
[dramatic music playing]
[suspenseful music playing]
I, uh... I spoke with Langley.
You'll need to wait another six months.
No, no, we've done everything
you have asked us to do.
Okay? And our visa is expired
and she will apply for refugee status
only when we get our papers.
And you'll get them. Soon.
Trust me.
Do I have a choice?
Robin...
we always have a choice.
By the way, an old friend of yours
is coming to visit.
He's looking forward to meeting you.
Friend? What do you mean?
Mirza. Brigadier Mirza.
He's in the US visiting his daughter,
insisted on thanking you in person
for saving his life.
{\an8}So Mirza, my wife and I will see you
at your place Saturday night for dinner.
Oh, and Robin, tell Maa ji to make that
fabulous mutton rogan josh of hers.
My wife will absolutely love it.
[phone ringing]
Mirza sahib is coming to the castle.
He's coming to Brutus' home for dinner.
If he eats a hearty meal,
he'll sleep very peacefully.
I can make a deal with Brutus.
No, no, no, no,
you're not doing any such thing.
Mission Brutus has to be
brought back home.
It's in place. Okay?
You just give me the details.
I will be speaking to Langley.
They will have to deport him.
How can you ever forget what Mirza
has done to all of us? Tell me.
It makes no difference if I forget or not.
But it's important that you forget.
Do you understand that?
KM?
KM, this is an order.
And you are doing nothing
that jeopardize...
{\an8}[Paaji] See, this is our India.
And this is America.
See how close they look over here?
But when we travel,
it takes such a long time. [chuckles]
[phone ringing]
Pass the phone.
Hello?
- [KM] Hello, Paaji.
- Who is this?
Cactus.
This white man has made our lives hell.
Mirza sahib also wants rogan josh
and it has to be halal.
I'm in the works,
but I somehow found that Peter guy.
You remember that shepherd
from behind the church? There.
He sells halal meat to Pakistanis,
I said sell it to us Indians also.
He agreed.
So, come and choose.
Hmm?
What is it?
Come. We can choose.
[dramatic music playing]
[laughs]
Charu, can you go get me an apple
for Kunal, please?
Maa ji, namaste.
Officially or unofficially,
Langley will deport you
on the basis of this video.
Jeev is waiting for my call in Delhi.
Uh, no, this is bullshit. Nothing...
What? What do you want us to do?
Those made-up stories you tell Kunal
about your heroism as his bedtime stories,
we've heard all of them.
He believes that you are his hero.
So become a hero for real.
For your son and for your country as well.
We'll take you back home like a true hero.
- Michelle.
- Yeah?
- Michelle, are you ready?
- Yeah.
- We gotta go.
- Sweetie, we won't be gone long, okay?
- I'll be fine. Have fun.
- Hey, Rose. Study.
- Yeah, yeah.
- No television.
- You be good.
- Just go.
See you, honey.
Have fun.
[Ravi] Mirza sahib.
- Welcome.
- My savior!
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Robin. So great to see you.
- Good to see you. Come, come, come.
- Thank you for having us.
- I love the smell of Indian food.
- Come.
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Michelle] So wonderful.
[upbeat music playing]
[Rose] Oh, my God.
[laughter]
- Mirza sahib.
- [Mirza] Cheers.
- [phone ringing]
- [indistinct chatter]
Yeah, yeah, honey.
- Everything all right?
- Dad, the power's not here
and I have my exams tomorrow.
- What do I do?
- What?
[Rose] Can you guys please come home now?
I'm really scared.
[David] Yeah, that is odd.
[Rose] All the other neighbors
have their lights on but we don't.
No, no... No, no, don't worry. I...
I'll come back. I'll be right there. Okay.
All right. Bye-bye.
All okay, Doc?
Yeah. Just I've gotta head back home.
There seems to be some problem
with the electricity at the house.
Darling, you stay here. Enjoy dinner.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
- [Michelle] Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.
Maybe I can come with you?
[David] No, no, no,
it's just a fuse or something.
You sure he can manage without you?
You know what? He's got this.
I've trained him well.
[laughter]
- [Mirza] Cheers to that.
- [Michelle] Cheers to that.
So tell me more about yourself.
[Paaji] So, madam, all good?
[shushes] The kid's sleeping inside.
[singing] ♪ Up above the world so high ♪
♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪
[suspenseful music playing]
[speaking in Hindi]
[in English] English,
if you don't mind, Mirza sahib.
So sorry. Really sorry.
My daughter, she's after my life.
But I said one thing...
Doc says he's going to be late
but he says we can start eating
without him.
It's fine.
I'd rather wait for him.
[Ravi's mother] Wait for what,
Mirza sahib?
What if the goat grows impatient
and comes back to life?
You should eat it before it does.
[laughs]
Maa ji, your sense of humor
is out of this world.
[both laugh]
Actually, I am famished.
- If it's not rude, then can I start?
- Of course.
Then let's do one thing.
Let's all of us have dinner together.
[Michelle] Thank you.
But you must not eat before David comes.
Why?
- It's Karva Chauth today.
- What's that?
In our culture, on this day,
we fast for the whole day.
And if you eat before your husband does,
then it brings him bad luck.
- Really?
- [Ravi's mother] Yes, Michelle.
I think you should not take a chance.
But you can drink as much as you want.
- [laughs]
- [chuckles] All right.
[contented sigh] Oh.
Mashallah!
Damn it, David!
What is taking you so long?!
I'm sorry, I can't wait.
Wow. This gravy looks amazing.
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Maa ji.
If you don't mind, may I get another drink
for myself to go with the food?
I'll get it for you.
You please enjoy the food.
- Maa ji, come on, give me a plate please.
- No, no, no, Mirza sahib.
You see, I've taken a vow that
until we are all granted citizenship,
I won't even touch non-vegetarian food.
[chuckles]
[Mirza] Uh, one ice cube, please.
- Ravi.
- Oh, no, don't even show it to me.
I have cholesterol issues.
Doctor's orders.
You have cholesterol at such a young age?
- Bad habits.
- And you?
- Karva Chauth!
- Exactly.
Which means,
all this mutton is only for me?
[laughing]
Then what are you waiting for?
Just dig in.
[suspenseful music playing]
[music builds, fades]
If you all don't mind,
may I use my hands to eat?
[laughing]
Why not, Mirza sahib? The best way to eat
is to eat with your hands, right?
So I'll just go wash my hands.
- [Ravi] It's over there in the...
- I'll manage. Don't worry.
What happened?
He wants to eat with his fingers.
It's a cultural thing.
Oh, okay.
[speaking in Hindi]
[speaking in Hindi]
[speaking in Hindi]
[speaking in Hindi, laughs]
[in English] "Gori"? I know that word.
It's slang for a white woman.
No, no, no. You're mistaken.
[Ravi speaking in Hindi]
[Charu] Misunderstanding.
Okay, don't panic.
Everything will be fine. Just wait.
[speaking in Hindi]
[in English] Is there something fishy
going on here?
Fishy? No, no.
Why would you say that, Michelle?
- Why would you say that? Eat.
- Have wine.
- I can't eat.
- Just eat.
[Ravi's mother] Ravi!
Mirza sahib? Mirza sahib?
What are you doing?
[tense music playing]
- Mirza sahib, no, no, no.
- Michelle, call David right now.
- What happened?
- Nothing happened. Just call him, I said.
My phone is in the car.
- My phone is here. Just take it.
- Okay. I'm calling David.
Mirza sahib, listen to me.
You're mistaken.
- Shut up.
- I'm trying to save you, Mirza sahib.
- Or else I'll slit her throat.
- [Ravi] Please.
- Okay now, Ravi.
- Uh... Let's just sit and talk.
- Let's just sit and talk, please.
- [screaming]
[gasps] Amma!
[grunting]
[Ravi] Amma!
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. Amma.
[Charu grunting]
- [Mirza] Bitch.

[grunts]
- [groans]
- [mutters]
[groans]
- No, Ravi.
- [Ravi] Move out of the way.
- Move out of the way.
- You will not do any such thing.
- Move out of the...
- No, Ravi.
- Her blood is still on my hands.
- No, Ravi.
There's blood on my hands!
- [grunts]
- [chokes]
- He killed my mother.
- [chokes]
But your son is alive.
He needs you.
[panting]
We need you.
- [groans]
- [sobs]
Amma! [sobs]
What is going on
with the electricity in this town?
Robin, I'm back.
Robin?
Robin, where are you guys?
What the fuck?
[Michelle] David. [sobs]
[David] Let me be perfectly clear.
If Mirza lives,
I'll help you out of this...
delicate situation.
But if he dies,
there's nothing I can do.
You'll all spend the rest of your days
in a cage in Guantanamo Bay.
[KM] Mm-hmm.
And the United States
will be exposed for espionage
in a country that they call an ally.
[nervous laugh]
After what he's done?
Ravi would never admit
to spying for the United States.
And I sure as hell won't either.
You just did.
Say cheese.
If we are exposed, I promise you,
I will personally ensure
that you're held responsible
for the murder
of the Bangladeshi Defense Minister.
That's not what I want. And nor do you.
- David, he's still alive.
- Shut up!
Look, what exactly is it that you want?
Seems like you guys are smart
only in your movies.
Why do you think he's still alive?
I could've slit his throat.
[David] If we put his head down...
he'll bleed out faster.
Not that.
Why don't you try the dal?
Yes.
Thank you.
- You can relax now.
- [cries]
[sobs]
[reporter] Bangladesh is in shock today
{\an8}as they deal with the tragic death
of their defense minister,
{\an8}Brigadier Saqlain Mirza.
Mirza, who was on
a personal visit to the US,
slipped while taking a shower
in his hotel,
leading to a fatal blow to his head.
His body will be returned to Bangladesh
{\an8}following an official state
department inquiry.
[solemn music playing]
Welcome back.
What?
Just missing Vikram.
When he was a kid,
he wanted to be a pilot.
It's his birthday today.
Did you wish him?
Why not?
He said, "Talk to me only when you have
the courage to speak the truth."
I didn't have the courage then
and nor do I have it today.
But you didn't need courage
to tell me your truth.
Because you're a stranger to me.
Maybe that's why you are
a stranger to him now.
The truth may hurt a lot,
but it can heal quite quickly.
Call him... and give him his birthday gift.

♪ Happy birthday, dear Vikram ♪
