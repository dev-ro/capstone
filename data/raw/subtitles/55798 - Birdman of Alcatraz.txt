You will see all the
man-made and natural beauties
of the most spectacular bay in the world.
You'll pass beneath
the famous Golden Gate Bridge,
considered to be one of the most
striking structures ever erected by man.
From the bay, you will thrill
to the magnificent San Francisco skyline.
Your cruise ship, the Harbour King,
will circle Alcatraz,
a maximum-security prison containing
the most dangerous criminals in America,
and has been the home of such
notorious figures as Al Capone,
Baby Face Nelson
and Machine Gun Kelly.
That's the island of Alcatraz.
There's a man leaving there today
after 17 years' imprisonment.
His name is Robert Stroud.
He's spent most of his life behind bars,
including 43 years
in solitary confinement.
He has never used a telephone
or driven an automobile.
The last time he broke bread
with another human being was in 1916,
the year Kaiser Wilhelm ordered the
sinking of the Lusitania in World War I.
My name is Tom Gaddis.
I wrote a book about this man.
Our story
properly begins in the year 1912.
A cargo of rebellious prisoners
was being transferred
from the federal penitentiary at McNeil
Island, Washington, to The Big Top,
the name given by convicts
to the prison at Leavenworth, Kansas.
Shut up!
Make one more move
and I'll take you off at the neck.
Robert F Stroud.
Breaking that window
was a serious offence.
It was hot. I was thinking of my lungs.
Did you think about the consequences?
You might have started a riot.
- Even a convict's got a right to breathe.
- Rights?
I don't think you know
the meaning of the word.
In 1909, in Alaska, you appointed yourself
judge, jury and executioner
and killed one... Charles Dahmer
because he allegedly beat up a friend
named Katie Malone... a prostitute.
You were transferred here to Leavenworth
because of an inferior record.
Now, I propose to give you a fresh start.
Such rights as you will enjoy are listed
here in my rules and regulations.
There are 86.
I suggest you memorise them.
I know 'em. They're the same in all pens.
They tell you when to eat,
when to sleep, when to go to the privy.
Precisely. And what you'll do
for every minute 24 hours a day.
You're going to be here
for nine long years, Stroud.
So with or without your cooperation,
I intend to make a man of you,
before you check out these gates.
You'll conform to our ideas
of how you should behave.
You'll learn the lesson now
or five years from now, but you'll learn.
For breaking that train window, all your
privileges are suspended for 30 days.
That's all, Mr Ransom.
Let's go.
You're one of the new fish
from McNeil, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I'm Tony Qualen.
Who are you?
Stroud.
You're lucky to be in this cellblock.
Boss here's a friend of mine.
Picture of your mother?
Put it back.
Put it back!
What did I do?
Just don't touch it again.
You know the guy
you're bunking with? Anthony?
Understand you and him
had a little misunderstanding.
Anthony is a friend of mine.
A very good friend.
He didn't mean nothin',
pickin' up the picture.
Beat it.
What kind of nut are you anyway? Just
because he picked up a picture of Mama?
Break it up!
Stroud! Stroud!
You ever mention
my mother again, I'll kill ya!
Stroud.
What's the matter, man?
What's eating you up inside, Bob?
You act as though you hate everyone.
You live in a pus-hole,
you act accordingly.
All right, Bob. Maybe 30 days in the hole'll
make you happy to see a face again.
Don't count on it... Harvey.
I don't think 30 days in the hole
is gonna cool that jaybird off, Warden.
Now, what do you suggest, Mr Kramer?
He's as mean as a boar hog.
If it was me, I'd keep him away from
the rest of the inmates permanently.
Isolation? No.
I don't give up on a man that easily.
Stroud comes from good stock.
He'll shape up.
He's a dingbat, Warden.
He's dangerous.
He's my responsibility, Mr Kramer.
Now, you let me worry
about his behaviour.
Yes, sir.
All right, Stroud.
Dearest Mother. I am feeling fine.
Hope you are the same.
Everything is OK at this end.
Time sure does fly.
Yesterday was
my fourth anniversary here,
but I got no cake. Ha-ha.
I guess everything would be all right
if I could just see you
and give you a great big hug.
I hope your cold is better.
Your loving son, Robbie.
Dearest Robbie.
I was here today to see you,
but they would not let me in,
it being Saturday,
with no visiting allowed.
But I saw Warden Shoemaker,
and he was kind enough
to arrange for a visit next Friday.
Until then, my darling,
this little gift of fruit comes
with all my love. Mother.
Guard, guard! Mr Kramer!
- What do you want?
- Did you know my mother was here?
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you call me?
You know the rules.
No visitors on Saturday.
That all you got in you? Rules?
Stop bellyaching. She said she'd be
here next week. You can see her then.
You ain't got much,
but you keep subtracting from it.
Don't you know I gotta put you
on report for touching a guard?
Mr Kramer...
If you shoot me on report,
I won't get no visit from my mother.
You should have thought of that before.
She came 2,000 miles.
All the way from Alaska.
Do me this one favour.
I just follow the rules.
Now get back to your seat.
- I tell you, I got to see her.
- And I told you to get back to your seat.
You ain't a man, Kramer. You're dog puke.
I just came from Kramer's widow.
I couldn't look her in the eye, Stroud.
I feel responsible for her husband's death.
He warned me about you.
He told me you were dangerous,
but I wouldn't listen.
And now he's cold in his grave.
You've taken the lives of two people
and haven't felt a twinge of conscience.
What do you want me to do?
Cry? Say I'm sorry?
I'm only sorry for Kramer's wife.
- And the dead man?
- He was fixing to brain me with his club.
I protected myself.
No remorse, huh?
No pity. Just an animal.
Ain't that what these cages are for?
Animals?
I have to make out a report
about this killing.
I hope it'll help to hang you.
Stroud had three trials.
The first one was declared a mistrial.
In the second, he was sentenced
to life imprisonment.
He appealed and was granted a third trial.
On June 28, 1918,
he heard the final verdict.
Therefore it is now by the court
considered, ordered and adjudged
that you be remanded to the custody of
the warden of Leavenworth penitentiary
and kept in solitary confinement there
until the 8th day of November, 1918,
and then and there be hanged
by the neck until you are dead.
No!
This sentence is unspeakable!
You call this justice?
You don't even know
the meaning of the word, sir.
Forget it. It's "Katy bar the door" for me.
I'm done.
Sit down, Robbie.
Sit down.
Look, Ma, you fought,
you spent all your money,
you got old followin' me from jail to jail.
It's time to douse the lights.
I told you before, Robbie,
I will not let them kill you.
I'm going to Washington DC very soon.
- I haven't begun to fight.
- Time's up.
You just don't know how to quit,
do you, Ma?
Did you think Mother was gonna
let them hurt my Robbie?
Carrying a petition for clemency,
Elizabeth Stroud doggedly haunted
the offices of Washington officials,
in an effort to gain an audience
with the president of the United States.
Finally, she managed to see
Senator Ham Lewis.
He reminded her
of the president's grave illness.
Grasping at straws,
she pleaded with the senator
to make an appointment for her
with the president's wife.
Reluctantly, he agreed.
Tell me, Mrs Stroud, why do you think
the president should intervene?
Mrs Wilson, the president is known
as the symbol of compassion
throughout the whole world.
I'm sure that deep in his heart
he doesn't believe in the brutality
of an eye for an eye.
I've never seen your husband,
but I've seen pictures of him.
He has the face of a man
who has known great suffering.
I think he'd understand what it means
to have the pack yapping at his heels.
Mrs Wilson, they've turned on
your husband in his fight for peace.
- They've broken his heart.
- Mrs Stroud, please.
There's only one man left in the world
who can lend a helping hand to my son,
and that's the president.
Take the petition to him.
I assure you, I give you my solemn oath,
my son is a person of worth.
Save him.
Stroud! Listen!
Hey, do you hear that, you cons?
President Wilson commuted Stroud to life!
Well, I'll be damned. She pulled it off.
Been expecting you, Harvey.
I have a telegram here from Washington.
You probably know about it.
I've heard.
I think you will live to regret
that this wire ever came.
How come?
Because you're going to spend
the rest of your life in deep-lock.
- Who says so?
- The attorney general.
Remember the judge's sentence?
"And kept in solitary confinement
until you are hanged by the neck."
But that ain't what the judge meant.
That's what the attorney general
says he meant.
Look around you, Stroud.
This is going to be your home
for as long as you live.
Ain't much more
you can do to me, is there?
A few things.
Consider this. You will not be permitted
to associate with the other prisoners,
not even to exercise with them.
You'll eat all your meals alone
for the rest of your life.
Visiting and corresponding privileges
will be limited to your immediate family.
And there'll be no work. Nothing to do
but count the hours and days and years.
They're tearin' down my gallows.
- To my great regret.
- Yeah.
It must have galled you
to give that order, Harv.
I think I got you figured out, Shoemaker.
First day here you as much as asked me
to get down on my knees and whimper.
I wouldn't do it then and I won't do it now.
I won't lick your hand
and that's what eats you, keeper.
You keep this in mind.
A man ain't whipped until he quits.
And I'll never give you that pleasure.
Now get outta here.
I'll never forget you as long as I live.
No matter what happens to me,
no matter where I am,
if I ever get a chance
to punish you further, I'll do it.
Drop in from time to time.
See how long I stick around.
I don't have to drop in on you.
I'll always know where you are.
Being in solitary
is like being on rails.
A man pushes your food
through the door.
You eat alone.
Once a week you get a shower.
You walk in the bullpen.
Once a month an inmate comes
and cuts your hair.
You read.
You pace your cell.
Once a week you get clean laundry.
You pace your cell.
The routine's always the same.
The only way you can break it
is to go on sick call.
You sit and listen to your heartbeat,
and you hear your life ticking away.
The thing that swells in your head
until you lose your mind
is you know absolutely for sure
what's coming next.
Here's that Argosy magazine
you wanted, Shorty.
Thanks, Bull.
Do you want anything to read, Stroud?
I want something from you, I'll ask for it.
Stroud! Get in outta the rain, you nut!
You're all gut, you little runt.
Hey, Stroud, what ya doin'
up there on the ceiling?
- Collecting beetles and cockroaches.
- I see.
Beetles and cockroaches.
Poor old Stroud. He's goin' bugs.
Gettin' pretty big now, huh?
About time for you to fly.
OK, kid, hop to it.
Well, go ahead, fly.
Well, come on, Runty, fly.
What's the matter?
A little chicken-hearted?
All right, come on, you little punk. Fly!
What are you gonna do when it's time to
go south for the winter? Walk to Mexico?
Hm.
All right, kid. Now give it a try.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, Runt. Come on, fly.
Here. Come on.
Come here. Come on.
Come on!
- What's the matter with you, anyway?
- He'll never get off the ground.
That bird's yellow to the core.
You gonna be a quitter? Hm?
Now you fly, you little punk, or I'll throw
you out on your ear, you hear me?
Fly!
Fly!
Yellow, huh?
Cold?
About six months
after Stroud picked up the sparrow,
the biggest piece of news
a penitentiary can get
went through Leavenworth
like a forest fire.
A new warden had been appointed.
West.
Rather.
Sacourivitch.
Hollister.
Stroud.
Warden, can I have a minute of your time?
I mean you, Warden Younger.
I'd like you to watch something.
OK, Runty.
That's it.
Come on, come on. Open it, open it.
Open it.
Open up. Go ahead.
Open it.
Go ahead. That's it.
That's it.
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.
Where did you get that bird?
Found him in the exercise yard, sir.
Just put your finger on his feet.
- What kind of a bird is that?
- A sparrow.
It must have taken great patience
to train him. I admire that.
Then I can keep him, sir?
I don't see why not. Do you?
You're the warden now, Jess.
It's up to you.
I think it'll be permitted.
Don't take advantage, Stroud.
I wouldn't think of it, sir.
- There is one thing.
- Yes?
- I need some birdseed.
- Birdseed?
Yes.
I doubt if we've got any in the warehouse.
I took the liberty of ordering some.
It's at the post office.
I need your permission
to have it released.
I like your nerve. You'll get your order.
Thank you.
Trained sparrows in solitary!
Pretty cute act you put on there.
Just amusing myself.
Still ignoring prison regulations,
aren't you?
I hear you're going to Washington to plan
a new Federal Bureau of Prisons.
Yes, I am.
Every pen run by the book, huh?
If you mean uniformity, you're right.
- Drop me a postcard, Harv.
- I plan to keep in touch.
- You did middlin', Runty. Middlin'.
- Middling?
He just saved your carcass, that's all.
Got the heart of an eagle.
When Younger allowed Stroud to keep
the sparrow, he opened the barn door.
Other inmates had relatives
send them canaries,
and the solitary block rang with song.
Then one prisoner became bored with his
two canaries, and gave them to Stroud.
That was a day penal authorities
will never forget.
What are you gawking at?
Looking at that bottle.
- Are you thirsty?
- Yeah.
- I want the bottle.
- What for?
I got a use for it.
What use?
I ain't gonna cut my throat,
if that's what's worryin' you.
- What about the refund?
- So I'll owe you a penny!
How about it?
Well, you're welcome.
Son of a...
- Well, now what do you want?
- That box you're sittin' on.
- That's tough.
- It's just an apple box.
- You could get another.
- I could.
- Well?
- But I ain't.
- Why not?
- I ain't so inclined.
All right, I'll buy it off you.
What do you want?
One pack of cigarettes? Two? Name it.
If you showed me a hundred-dollar bill,
you couldn't have this box.
What the hell is eatin' you?
12 years I've known you, Stroud.
12 years, sun up and sun down, I've had
to look at that frozen mug of yours.
And in all that time, never so much
as a how-de-do out of you.
I try to treat you decent,
cos you got no bed of roses.
So I put my head on the block
and I dummy up about the birds.
Did you say thanks, my boy?
Did just once you say thanks?
Or maybe I just didn't hear you.
You're a soft speaker.
You want a pop bottle.
You want a pop bottle.
Do I hear maybe
the word "please" someplace?
Or could I be goin' deaf?
"Hand over the box" says you,
like you was the tsar of Russia
or somebody.
You get this. I may be just a uniform
to you, but you got no patent on feelings.
I'm a man, the same as you,
and I wanna be treated like one.
So you'd better come up
with a few manners with me,
or don't even expect the time of day
from yours truly!
Mr Ransom.
- You know what I think, Bull?
- I don't give a damn what you think.
I think you're absolutely right.
I admire ya for sounding off like that.
I had it comin'.
You always treated me square.
You been good to me.
So there's something I wanna do.
I wanna apologise to you.
I ain't apologised to anybody in 20 years.
- Hey, Stroud.
- Yeah?
My bird won't sing.
Is he sick?
I'll check him.
You sick, little baby canary Jack?
Say "tweety-dee", sweetheart.
Tweet tweet tweet tweet.
I don't know.
You been giving him special feedings
of grasshoppers and bugs like I told you?
I can't find any!
By the time I get to the bullpen,
you cleaned it out!
What do you want me to do?
You got a way with birds.
You take Jack for a while, huh?
What about birdseed?
All right, I'll split mine with you.
- What do you say?
- All right. Send him in.
Only for about a year or so
and then I want him back.
OK.
You be careful, take it easy
and don't mash him.
You don't care of him, I'll bust you apart.
- Don't worry, Feto.
- Come on, Gomez.
It's your exercise period.
Well, how about it, Stroud? Is he sick?
- I don't think so.
- Why don't he sing?
- It wouldn't be polite.
- Don't be smart!
Feto, don't you know
a lady canary never sings?
Lady canary?
- You mean Jack's a broad canary?
- Yep. A hen.
Well, tough luck, Bob.
You're stuck with a bird that don't sing.
Use up a lot of birdseed, huh?
Working with a razor blade
and a jagged piece of glass,
Stroud cut 128 slats,
in addition to roof boards,
tier bars, gate pieces and a handle.
Every joint was charred for hardness
and hand-fitted,
since he had no glue.
The birdcage took
seven months to complete.
Bob, that's a hell of a job you did there.
It's all right. Not bad.
- Next one'll be better.
- The next one?
What do you want another one for?
Ain't you got eyes? Mr and Mrs.
There's gonna be
some procreation around here.
- Procre... what?
- New life. Birth.
- In a prison?
- Yep.
Well, I guess they won't mind.
Canaries are always behind bars anyway.
It's springtime outside, slugger.
You best go find out who you are.
Come on.
Now what's wrong with you,
you old buzzard? Come on.
Don't be afraid.
Out there you can kick up the dust.
You can dance to fiddle music.
Watch the alfalfa bloom.
If you like, you can... see gold teeth.
Taste sweet whisky and red-eyed gravy.
The air breathes easy, nights move faster,
and you tell time by the clock.
Now you don't wanna be a jailbird
all your life, do ya?
You're a highballin' sparrow.
So you fly high, old cock.
Go out there and bite the stars - for me.
Find yourself a fat mama
and make a family.
You hear?
Beat it.
Hey, Stroud.
Yeah, Feto?
- My bird laid an egg, huh?
- My bird laid an egg.
Why, you stinkin' crook!
I only loaned you my canary!
For a year.
I want half them eggs.
What for? You gonna make an omelette?
Any con who'd steal canary eggs
from another con is a dirty fink!
And a rat!
How many, Stroud?
Two?
How many, Stroud?
Three? Dirty crook.
How many?
Four.
How many?
Hey, Stroud. Anything happen yet?
Now it's been 20 days and 18 hours.
What's goin' on in there?
- Hey, Bob, what's that noise in there?
- Quiet, Feto.
Feto, you're a godfather.
Sealed off from the world,
denied the fundamental drive of man
to beget his own kind,
Stroud developed a world
in microcosm with his birds.
And because it was safe, and he knew
they would never turn on him,
he developed a deep but private
love for his canaries,
as he watched the cycle of love
and mating and issuing forth.
Then, one spring day,
an old friend came back.
Runty! What the hell
are you doin' back here?
Too tough out there, huh?
Come back for a little prison security.
I guess you're a lifer, pal, just like me.
Hey, Stroud. How come
the birds ain't singin'?
Because they're sick, and so's mine.
Hey, Stroud.
My bird's gonna kick off?
"Dreaded among breeders is a highly
contagious disease called septic fever."
"Its actual existence can only be surmised
by a postmortem by
a veterinary surgeon trained in..."
- Bob!
- Pipe down, Gomez.
"Death may be rapid or delayed."
"Faeces are abnormal
and always pale yellow in colour."
"There's no practical remedy."
Stroud?
I found Bacillus pasteurella
in great quantity.
I'd make an educated guess
that there's a filterable virus.
That it is septic fever?
Possibly.
Are there any chemicals
or medicines or anything?
I couldn't find any literature on
the disease. Apparently there isn't any.
So, without any specific drug, I'm afraid
there isn't much I can do to help.
Thanks, Doc. I appreciate what you done.
Sorry.
Any change?
Runty.
Shame.
He wasn't much of a bird. I threw him out,
but I guess it was too tough for him.
He had to come back
where he could freeload.
He was a born panhandler.
Tried to get rid of him
as late as last Friday.
I warned him, but he wouldn't
listen to me. He was too smart.
He'd rather have the walls
than somebody to talk to.
He didn't amount to much.
Hey, Bob.
You know Ape?
The baby bird you slipped me.
Well, in case you're interested,
he just knocked off.
Punk.
He dropped like he got shot in the head.
Reminded me of an old girlfriend
of mine named Peggy... Beeman.
What a face. Like a pan full of worms.
But stacked. Like to make
your tongue hang out.
Good-hearted broad, you know.
She used to put out to me.
And every other guy
in the neighbourhood.
A bum, in other words.
Well, she had a bird too. A parrot.
And he too was ugly also.
And one time I came up to her room,
and the door was open,
and she was tryin' to teach
the parrot to say somethin'.
You'll get a boot outta this, Bob.
You know what she wanted him to say?
"I love you, Peggy."
Over and over, you know,
she kept at him. "I love you, Peggy."
Oh, them two uglies.
I figured she was some kinda nut, so
I never seen her no more after that time.
Good old Peg.
So what happens?
So I wind up in the can,
and I'm talking to the birds
just like she did.
You know... I gotta admit it,
for the first time since I been in stir,
them baby canaries,
they make me feel good.
You know, it ain't just right
to flush Apey down the toilet bowl.
Hey, Stroud, what am I
supposed to do with him, huh?
What am I gonna do?
Hey, Bob?
Stroud struck back
at the oldest enemy of all.
Wash the cages, sterilise
the cell from top to bottom,
read everything in
the prison library about birds.
He learned of oxidisers, which had been
used as a poultry germicide for years.
He wrote to his mother, asking
for these drugs, plus equipment.
While waiting, he tried
fantastic concoctions on his birds,
like a sulphur solution
made from the heads of matches.
The birds died with increasing swiftness.
The package of drugs and
equipment came from Mother.
With little or no knowledge of the amount
of chemicals a canary could tolerate,
Stroud proceeded to administer
the oxidisers to his sick birds.
Clearly, this drug was
no cure for septic fever,
but Stroud persisted,
trying different combinations.
The birds still died.
However, Stroud made one discovery:
Before death, their temperature
dropped to normal.
He concluded the chemicals
were too harsh, too caustic.
He decided to buffer them
with effervescent sodas.
The birds died.
Hey, Stroud! When you gonna
find a medicine for my birds?
They're droppin' like flies!
- We'll just have to wait.
- Wait?
I'm gonna kill 'em all!
Finally, there was only
one more buffering agent left
in his tiny arsenal of drugs:
Citrocarbonate.
He combined this
with potassium chlorate.
He dosed his birds. After that,
all he could do was hope.
- Three o'clock, Bob.
- Thanks, Johnson.
Hey, Bob?
What happened? Why is that bird singin'?
You find a medicine?
Go to it, kid. Sing your heart out.
The years passed,
and news of Stroud's medicine spread
to the gentle world of bird owners.
People began to wonder who
this strange new bird doctor was.
Finally, someone got curious.
Bob, did you enter some kind of a contest
in one of those canary magazines?
Yeah. I won second prize - a roller canary.
Well, you'd better go pick it up.
It's in the deputy's office.
Good.
- What's up?
- Not a thing.
You must be Mr Stroud.
Here you are. Your second prize.
