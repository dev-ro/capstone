After fifty years of bitter warfare
the Eastern Federation
has beaten Europa's armies
and taken control
of the Eurasian continent.
But pockets of resistance
fighting the oppressive new regime,
remain in Eurasian Zone Seven.
The military mobilizes once again.
Again, families must lose their sons.
I'm honored to present my findings
to this forum of the Health Ministry.
Gentlemen, as you know,
we've beaten Eurasia
and brought it under control.
But the speed of our victory
mustn't stop us looking within.
Our nation's health is in crisis.
Radioactivity...
industrial waste...
chemical weapons have poisoned us.
Environmental diseases are epidemic
and a threat to our future.
Genetic mutations are rampant:
beyond the reach of current medicine.
Allow me to present my findings.
These are ''neo-cells'',
the fruit of my years of study.
I found them in the genome
of a primitive ethnic group.
They can be converted into any cell
All of the internal organs,
nerves, bone, skin, hair...
everything can be cultured
and harvested at our convenience.
Simply put:
'spare parts' for
the human machine.
With no risk of tissue rejection
the medical technology of our dreams
is finally at hand.
Can we use it now?
With funding, it's a matter of time.
Our clone work
is years ahead of you!
It's just a theory!
Father, must you listen further?
Yes, it's theoretical
but if I get funding
and the facilities I need,
we can save our people.
Think of your children...
your parents...
and your wives.
Luna...
When the war ends, let's get married.
Sure.
Is this what we fought for?
Fifty years of struggle
to end up too exhausted
to rebuild our society?
I read your paper.
"Human Regeneration Technology"
A dream come true...
...if it's possible.
Itfs definitely possible.
With more research, right?
Professor Azuma,
those fools won't recognize your work.
In fact they daren't.
It's taboo to suggest,
our original genes need improving.
Pardon me. I'm Kaoru Naito
of Nikko Hairal Inc.
We've already built a lab
to host your research.
How come?
The military's taken an interest.
General Kamijo?
The Defense Ministry is
at your disposal.
Sorry to hear your wife is unwell.
What're you getting at?
Work with us...
let all our dreams come true.

Dr. Kozuki, move to the right.
Dr. Kozuki, move to the right.
That's it.
Maybe place a hand
on your daughter's shoulder?
Okay, that's wonderful.
Smile, please.
Is your mind made up?
Yes.
With your mother ill?
And what about Luna?
I can't stay here
while my friends are fighting.
You hate being a doctor that much?
It's my duty to my country.
You've no idea what war is like.
It can't be worse than cowardice.
Darling...
Let's not fight today...
Forget it, Mother.
Go ahead, please.
Luna,
Congratulations on your engagement.
Thank you.
Kozuki, excuse me.
My new lab opened last week.
One Year Later
Eurasia, Zone Seven
Shoot, shoot!
Kill her.
Do it or you're next.
Understand?
Midori...
Be patient.
Ifm going to find a cure.
Grenade!

Culture Lab.
One moment, please.
Dr. Kozuki is downstairs.
Bring him up.
Up here?
That's right.
Right away.
Impressive security.
Sorry for the sudden invite.
Is Luna with you?
She's in the lobby.
Midori wanted to see you both.
A nice idea after so long.
She must get lonely.
Has it been a year already?
Thanks to my son...
Luna must be suffering.
Still no word?
Not to me, at least.
He went to war to spite me.
Sons always defy their fathers.
He despises me.
I put my work before family
but can't even cure my own wife.
Isn't the neo-cell treatment
nearly ready?
Itfs incredible what you've done...
Usable?
No.
Fixing wounded men
with new organs...
makes my armor
research redundant.
Itfs far from complete.
And I'm out of time.
Is she that ill??
She's almost blind.
Still doing research, though...
There's selective leaf decay
and darkening overall.
Poor nutrition, perhaps?
How about the others?
Here they are.
Did you hear something?
No, I didn't.
I think someone just arrived.
Ifm sorry. Would you go check?
Certainly.
Mother.
Ifm home.
Can you find a cure?
Then, shouldn't you be with her?
I mustn't give up.
Yes?
No...
Tetsuya.
Ifm so glad you're home safely.
We must be thankful.
Did you see Luna, yet?
Ifll see her soon.
You must. She waited so long.
I know...
Ifm so forgetful.
They're coming for dinner tonight.
It'll be such a surprise.
Ikegami-san, Ikegami-san!
Professor!
What's wrong?
My son...
he's dead...
September 16th, Sergeant Azuma,
made the final sacrifice,
Losing his life in duty
for god and country.
A most...
a most noble and heroic end.
After posthumous promotion,
hefll be buried tomorrow.
Tetsuya!
A state funeral
with full military honors.
You may view the body tonight.
Please get ready.
Luna...
I messed up; now you're alone.
We had all the time in the world,
so I took you for granted.
I know it's too late, now...
but Ifll never leave your side again.
His body's on the way here.
The funeral's tomorrow.
Did you tell Midori?
She already knows.
Warning
Malfunction!
Pressure overload. Cause unknown!
Osmosis tank failure!
Shut down the vacuum feed.
What's going on?
What the hellfs that?
Culture fluidfs transforming.
What the...
The neo-cells...
It's the neo-cells.
Organs are recombining.
Professor, what's going on?
What the...?
What is it?
Code 206, code 206!
Itfs me, Naito!
Get in here, now!
Professor, let's go!
Open up!
We're still in here!
They're coming...
Go secure the overflow!
Hold up!
Set up an outside perimeter.
Who said we take orders from you?
The whole project's my responsibility.
Grunts shut up
and do as they're told.
All of you, outside!
Get me H.Q.
Luna...
What happened?
Naito here. Ifm inbound.
Ifll report when I get in.
Mother...
Tetsuya...
They're escaping by vehicle.
with a hostage.
Seal off Eurasian Zone Three.
Where's my wife?
Hold on, my dear.
Azuma.
What's going on?
Are you out of your mind?
Your son is dead.
I don't want to come back.
Please.
Stop!
Give me a hand.
How on earth can this be?
You can escape through that door.
Look after Tetsuya.
You mustn't die.
Hold on!
Don't die.
Don't die.
Dear God...
What have you done?
What?
Foreign agitators are still at large.
Heavily contaminated with infection,
please report their presence.
Let's see I.D.
Please proceed.
It seems they're heading
for Zone Seven.
Kozuki Residence.
This is the body armor I developed.
It completely shields the soldier
and lets him move like lightning.
Tetsuya's muscle is so over developed
he may tear himself apart.
We must contain the internal pressure.
Sekiguchi!
Hold on!
Sekiguchi, don't die!
Mother...
...you so hated the war.
Wondered when it would end...
How many would have to die...
If peace would ever come...
We live!
Against all odds, we survived.
Did men recognize our right to life?
No. They murdered our brothers.
As if they had the right to judge.
As if they deserved such power.
We have equal right to life.
It can't be rationed.
Nor denied at birth.
No way.
Of course it can't!
But man presumed to judge us.
Wefll have our revenge.
Wefll build a kingdom here.
Live our lives to the full
and do what we must.
Let us be called ''Neo-Sapiens''
We hereby vow
to eliminate mankind.
We are the Neo-Sapiens.
Bow down before us.
Are we ready for the next offensive?
Yes.
Two divisions are standing by.
Intelligence reports eleven scientists
in the target area.
Roboticians, nuclear physicists
and an armor specialist.
Perfect for our new factory.
Is it ready?
Bring me those scientists.
Let them contribute to our power.
Forget it.
Reports indicate
military scientists
being abducted
to work in robot factories.
Our military is strengthening defense
of civilian installations.
That's as much as I can do.
Itfs not perfect
Father?
Dr. Kozuki, armor specialist.
He's ours now.
Puny human.
Tetsuya?
My boy...
My boy...
Fate has something in store for you.
Itfs going to be tough.
But...
There's got be a reason for it.
There must be...
You must seek out your destiny.
Luna.
Ifm sorry.
Never look back.
Father!
Tetsuya, get up.
Come on.
Tetsuya, wake up!
Where is she?!
Who the hell are you?
where is my mother?!
You're supposed to be dead.
Tetsuya...
Stop.
Stop!
Get lost!
Move!
Go away, freaks!
Are your 'neo-cells' ready?
I can't afford to wait.
What use are you, if you can't deliver?
No more excuses, Naito.
As selfish as ever.
All you think about is yourselves.
How dare you!
Old farts saving their own skins.
Even for the generalfs son,
this is unforgivable.
Our nation faces the Neo-Sapien threat
yet your only worry is your health?
That's unforgivable.
Son.
You know this is treason?
Of course.
The Eastern Federation is now mine.
Sorry. The era of
brain-dead idiots is over.
Son!
Satisfied, now?
Commander Kamijo.
Let me introduce
Professor Azuma.
Father of the Neo-Sapiens?
Why did you lie to him?
That's strange.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I didn't create them.
I don't know how they came to life.
Itfs too late to claim ignorance.
They grow stronger by the day.
If we don't find their weakness,
learn how to fight them...
our own lives may be in danger.
Keep up your research.
In return, the army will find your wife.
Stick to the story, old chap.
Don't rock the boat.
Your time has come at last.
Why must people always fight?
Who did this?
We're hurt, so we hurt in turn...
We're killed, so we kill in turn...
Endless repetition.
I can see it.
What must I do?
What can you see?
A vision...
of how it might've been...
And now...
my own father killed...
What should I do?
What would be best?
of peace...
Shall I get a gun and kill?
If it'd taken away the pain.
Should I fight, too?
Stop talking nonsense.
But you fought?
It's my duty.
You wanted to go to war.
You've no idea what war is like...
You've no idea what war is like.
You've no idea what war is like.
