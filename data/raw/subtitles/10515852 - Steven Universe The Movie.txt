Once upon a time,
the Gem Homeworld
was ruled by Diamonds...
White, Yellow, Blue,
and the littlest Diamond, Pink.
While the other Diamonds
conquered many worlds
across the galaxy,
Pink had only one...
the planet Earth.
One day, Pink fled
the comforts of Homeworld.
On Earth, she made a new home,
new friends,
and finally, new life,
giving up her form
to bequeath her gem
to her half-human son.
Without Pink, Gemkind entered
an era of despair.
But when Steven Universe
learned of his heritage,
he reunited
with his fellow Diamonds
and championed
a new era of peace and freedom
across the furthest
regions of space.
And now, dear Gems everywhere,
I'm pleased to announce
that Steven is finally ready
to take his rightful place
on Pink Diamond's throne.
How's it going, everybody?
I know you all might be thinking
of me as the new Pink Diamond,
but you don't have to
put me on a throne.
I already have a rightful place,
and it's on Earth.
- Huh?
- What?
It's a beach house,
where I live with my friends,
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl.
As much as I've loved
dismantling the Empire
and saving all your planets,
I can't wait to get home
and spend some quality time
with my friends.
Cut the feed.
Your time is up anyway.
I think that went well.
Steven, please.
You can't go.
You must stay.
You're all we have left
of Pink.
Steven, you belong here,
with us.
Uh... thanks,
but no thanks.
♪ Come live with us
in the palace ♪
♪ There's a room
waiting for you ♪
- ♪ Come on ♪
- ♪ Come on ♪
♪ Come on ♪
♪ Just let us adore you ♪
You guys have really gotten
better at showing affection,
but I've got my own life
to get back to.
Don't forget,
I'm not Pink Diamond.
♪ Yes, we know
that you're not her ♪
♪ But you were hers ♪
♪ You know what
it meant to love her ♪
♪ And you remind us
so much of her ♪
Thanks.
But I really gotta go.
- But Steven! - But Steven!
- But Steven!
I've disbanded my armies.
I've liberated my colonies.
I never shatter.
I never make anyone cry.
I've been saying "please"
and "thank you,"
even to lower life forms.
What did we talk about?
Ugh, equal life forms.
Steven, we've done
everything you've asked.
That's great! Good job.
Keep it up. Bye!
Steven!
What took so long?
Mm.
The Diamonds.
They really want me
to move in.
- Why?
- Because they want to smother me
with attention 24/7.
Sounds fun.
No, it doesn't.
Well, I'm glad I got to see you
before heading out.
You're really going
through with it?
Of course. I've always wanted
to go to space camp.
But you've literally been
to space multiple times.
And you've done way cooler stuff
than just camp there.
My parents are doing what they
can to support my interests.
It's sweet.
Plus, I get all the freeze-dried
ice cream I can eat.
But Sadie Killer and the
Suspects are playing tonight.
Isn't a rock show a little
better than space camp?
It's maybe equal
to space camp.
That's my mom.
I should get going.
- Mm!
- Mm!
Mwah. Okay.
Bye!
Tell everyone at space camp
that space used to be
super scary and dangerous,
but it's great now!
I will!

Hey, any idea
what Amethyst is up to?
I have every idea
what everyone is up to.
You'll find her if you head
to Little Homeworld.
Take the Warp.
Whoa!
Careful, dude!
- Pew! Pew!
- Pew! Pew!
- One, two, three, hup!
- One, two, three, hup!
Thanks, Amethyst.
- Whoa!
- Steven,
you're just in time!
We're about to install
the new Warp.
Which means Little Homeworld
is 83.7% complete.
Only 83.7%?
We'd better get cracking.
I'm on it!
Wow. Little Homeworld's
growing fast.
So are you.
Look at me! I'm a young adult!
I love that all these Gems
want to make their new home on Earth.

Are you Steven Universe?
Um... yes?
Perfect.
Move!
Hey.
Nice park job, dingus.
Well, well,
well, well, well.
Lemme get a look
at the menagerie.
You must be Amethyst.
You must be Garnet.
And Pink Diamond's Pearl.
Wow.
She took you with her.
Isn't that just... swell?
It can't be.
Oh, but it can be,
and it is.
I got a new style
and a few new toys
that are gonna put an end

Whoa, whoa. Th-This has got
to be a misunderstanding.
In case you haven't heard,
I've established peace
across the...
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Aw, what's
the matter, Steven?
Miss your friends already?
Well, don't worry.
You're right behind 'em!
That was nothing!
Then I guess you won't mind
if I do it again!
Ow!
Cut it out!
You don't poof, do you?
Hmm.
Figured as much.
Just wait!
Your human half
won't stand a chance
against my injector.
Not after
what I just did to your gem!
What are you
talking about?
You weren't always
a powerful hero, were you?
Better bubble you
before anything else happens.
What?
Where's my bubble?
Come on.
What's going on?
Steven!
I came as fast as I could!
Are you okay?
Holy s-s-she really
got everybody!
- Is that her?
- Yeah.
- Who...
- No idea.
- Why?
- No idea.
How?
She hit all of us
with this.
Waah!
- Phew.
- It did something extra weird to me,
and now my powers
aren't working right.
Look.
There's something wrong
with me, Dad.
I just have no idea
what's going on.
Well, son, now you know
how I feel almost all the time.
But you know what else?
Any moment now, the Gems
are gonna do that thing
where they glow
and float in the air
and reappear
better than ever.
Huh?
See? Here she comes.
Good old Pearl.
Huh.
Well, that's new.

Boop!
Now it's your turn!
W-W-W-Would you
cut that out?
Please?
Hey, look!
There's more Gems!
Let's ask 'em to play.
W-Wait a minute.
You don't remember?
Remember what?
Wowee!
That thing sure is big!
You wanna climb it or somethin'?
Wait, wait.
Are you serious right now?
What about
that stuff you said
about how I won't stand a chance
against your injector?
I said what now?
You really
don't remember, huh?
How 'bout you, Lion?
Can you make
any sense of this?
Aw, you're no help, either.
At least I can store this thing
in your mane.
I can't store things
in Lion's mane now?
That's like
the easiest thing I do!
What do I do?
I've got no friends to help me,
except...
Bismuth, Lapis, and Peridot.
Come on, guys. Let's go
figure out how to fix this.
G-Guys?
My Um Greg, allow me.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm. Hmm.
Ruby? Sapphire?
She's not going anywhere
with you.
I do see us following him
to the countryside.
Never mind! We're going.
Wait. Don't leave me alone
with these two!
Just keep an eye
on them for now.
I'll be back.
She rode in on that?!
Yeah.
She said my human half
wouldn't stand a chance
against her injector.
What does that mean?
Why don't we
just ask her?
Well, here's the thing.
Hmm? What?
Where'd she... Aah!
Surprise!
Here she is,
my new best friend, Spinel.
A pleasure to meet you all.
I thought you said she was
just trying to kill you.
- Wow. Quick turnaround.
- No kidding.
It took me months to stop
trying to kill Steven.
I say it took me a day,
day and a half?
I'm still on the fence.
Alright, let's see this thing
she hit you with.
Uh, right.
Whoa. Was there, like,
a laser or...
Be careful with that.
It's a rejuvenator.
Homeworld used to use
these things
on Gems that started
steppin' out of line.
One hit with this...
you're back
to how they made you.
What are you lookin' at?
Oh, my stars,
I touched it!
I could have lost
all my character development.
Wait, how did you survive
being hit by that thing, Steven?
I-I think I didn't.
My human half kept me
from poofing, but...
but my Gem half,
it took the hit.
She sent me back.
It's like I'm a kid again.
I can barely
control my powers.
How do we reverse this?
Oh, no.
Do I need
to get the Diamonds?
You're the one
with healing powers.
If anyone can fix this,
it's you.
I can't believe this.
For the first time in years,
everyone's in danger.
Everybody needs me,
and I'm useless.
Bismuth, what do we do?
I'm sorry, Steven.
I don't know.
Garnet would know what to do.
Garnet always
knows what to do.
Hey, don't be sad!

There's gotta be some way
to make them remember.
- What if it's like a puzzle?
- Huh?
If we give 'em
all the pieces,
eventually,
they'll get the picture.
Spinel, you might
be onto something.
If every experience they lost
is a-a piece of who they are,
we just have to give them back
all the pieces,
one experience at a time.
Are you serious?
That could take forever!
Exactly.

Hup, hup, hup, hup.
Mm-hmm.
Hup, hup, hup, hup,
hup, hup, hup, hup.
So, when Ruby and Sapphire
first became Garnet,
Ruby rushed in
to save Sapphire from danger,
and bam... They fused.
So, maybe we've gotta create
some sort of
dangerous situation.
Well, what do we have
that's deadly
and dangerous laying around?
I think we could
dig something up.
Danger, danger, danger.
What have we got?
Hmm. No.
Aha!
A giant pizza cutter?
That is one of its
functions, yes.
I can't threaten them
with this.
Hmm. Here.
Now it's much
more threatening.
Off you go, now.
Good luck!
Hup, hup, hup, hup,
hup, hup, hup.
Hup, hup, hup, hup.
Hmm? Halt!
I cannot allow you
to approach my Sapphire
with such
a threatening device.
That's too bad,
'cause I'm gonna... get you!
Will this work?
Permission to dispatch the
curly-haired one, my Sapphire?
No need. I predict he won't
be able to follow through.
She's right.
Ugh, I can't.
Even if we are
just pretending.
My Sapphire,
you were right!
What do you predict
will happen next?
Well, the Spinel will pick up
that device out of curiosity.
Hmm.
Hijinks will ensue.
Maybe we should try...
Wait, Spinel.
No, no, no, no!
Don't touch that thing!
Hey, we just built that!
Whoa, here she comes!
Spinel!
My scaffolding.
My precious scaffolding!
Wow!
What happens next?
In just a moment,
the scaffolding will start
falling all around you.
What?
Hup!
Wow.
You're amazing!
Hmph. Next,
the Peridot will hold back
some of the falling debris.
Three large barrels
will fall.
The Bismuth will catch
two of them.
I got this, Biz!
Nice work, Perido...
Oh, shucks!
Ah. Shoot!
Oh, no! The Heaven
and Earth Beetles
are out for their afternoon
constitutional!
The Lapis will rush in
and save them at the last second.
Whew.
You guys okay?
- Whoa.
- Is it... over?
The saw.
The saw
will continue to cut.
The anvil will fall.
And you...
you will be shattered.
Huh? Aah!
Huh?
The curly-haired one's power
is fading.
Ruby, I'm sorry!
I told you
you wouldn't last the day.
Well, I'm glad fate allowed me
to meet you.

do you know me?
Good question.
Her memories aren't back.
I guess fusion was only
the first piece.
Attention, everyone.
Um Greg Universe has arrived.
Steven! Oh!
Have you seen Amethyst?
What?
I told you to watch her.
She must have wandered off
while I was wrestling my laundry
out of Pearl's hands.
Pearl!
You don't have to do that.
I own a car wash!
I need to go
find Amethyst.
- Can you watch Garnet?
- Yeah, sure.
But it looks like
she's doing a pretty good job
watching herself.
Thanks.
Don't forget
your best friend, Spinel!
Oh, right.
Spinel, you stay here
with the others,
and I'll be right back.
No!
O-Okay.
Let's go together?
Yay!
Amethyst?
Amethyst?
- Aah!
- Amethyst?
Amethyst?
Wait, can I get
a couple to go?
Amethyst!
I've got tasty donuts!
Come and get 'em!
Worth a try.
Where can she be?
Huh?
Amethyst?
What is this place?
I-It's an art studio.
Amethyst used to come here
all the time.
Aah!
Amethyst,
thank goodness you're okay.
Thank goodness
you're okay.
I'm very not okay,
but I've got a plan.
I'm gonna get us all back
piece by piece.
I just have to figure out
your pieces.
These paintings.
Do you remember
being painted?
Being painted?
Pew, pew!
Do you remember our handshake?
Our handshake?
Singing and dancing,
that's gotta be a piece.
Do you remember singing
and dancing with me?

Pew!
Pew, pew?
- One, two, three, hup.
- One, two, three, hup.
Amethyst!
Whoa.
Ohh.
Ohh, what happened?
Amethyst, it worked!
You're back!
Mm.
You! Wha...
W-What are you doing here?!
So, l-let me explain.
Get away from him,
you monster!
Huh?
A monster?
Where is it?
No, I don't see it.
Aah. You're it.
Oh!
Ready or not, here I come!
Boop!
Oh! I forgot to say
"you're it"!
Okay, tag, you're it!
What the heck
is this about?
She doesn't remember
attacking us.
She doesn't even remember
that thing.
What the...
Mm, you guys not know
how to play tag?
Steven, what is
going on here?
I'm not sure,
but I'll find out.
Let's open up the shelters.
We might need to evacuate.
Lapis, Bismuth, Peridot!
What's the damage?
Amethyst, get away from me.
I can't stand to see you
all vacant
and bereft of personality.
Yo, I'm back, you dip.
Oh! Well, you're just in time
for the end of the world!
This is no ordinary injector.
Whatever it's leaking
into the ground is toxic.
Let's get a scan going
and see what we're dealing with.
Just as I thought.
Bio-poison. Pure and uncut.
As of this moment,
the ampoule has drained
15.4% of its contents,
meaning the poison is releasing
at a destruction rate
of 5 cubic meters per hour,
giving us, hmm...
41 hours until the destruction
of all organic life on Earth.
All organic life?
Yeah, like the animals,
the plants, the insects.
You know... people.
Oh, no.
This is what Spinel meant.
"Your human half won't stand
a chance against my injector."
She... She brought this thing
here to kill me,
and now... now it's gonna kill
everything else on Earth, too?
I've got to do something!
- No, Steven, wait!
- Steven! Stop!
Super Steven strength!
- Steven!
- Careful!
What is
that clod thinking?
Yeah!
Lift with your legs!
Aah!
Well, look
what I reeled in.
- Steven!
- Are you okay?
My organic jacket.
I can't do anything
with my powers like this.
Bismuth, Lapis,
can't you lift that thing?
Peridot, what about
your metal powers?
You think
we didn't try that?
Disturbing the injector
accelerates the poison's rate
of release.
Also, it might explode.
We have to find a way to move it
without touching it,
before it's too late.
Spinel...
She activated it,
so she must be able
to deactivate it,
but she doesn't even
remember what it is,
let alone
how to control it.
Then you gotta
change her back.
No way!
She's cute and harmless now,
but if we bring her back,
she'll kill us all!
You're going to die anyway
if you don't get her
to deactivate that thing.
She's right, Steven.
You got me back.
Whatever you did for me,
just do it for her.
That's different.
I know you.
I don't know anything
about Spinel.
None of us had ever even
heard of her before.
Except... Pearl.
Pearl knew her.
I'm afraid I can't help.
I'm currently in the service
of my Um Greg Universe,
preparing for
tonight's concert,
showcasing
a promising ensemble
in the "rockinroll" genre.
Pfft.
You're evacuating people
to the warehouse?
I'll...
I'll cancel the rock show.
No? You're right.
Sadie Killer always
draws a crowd.
You got it, Mayor.
I'll drop the cover charge
and, heck, 30% off merch.
- Dad.
- Steven, you found Amethyst!
Who is Amethyst?
Oh, no.
She's even worse.
Nah, I'm just goofin'.
Too soon, Amethyst.
Garnet, are you okay?
Did you want the red cable
or the blue cable?
It doesn't matter!
They're the same!
Pearl, what are you doing?
We need those for the show!
Who cares about
the rock show?
We have to stop
Spinel's injector,
or everyone on Earth
is going to die!
To stop it,
we need Spinel back,
and to do that,
we need Pearl back,
and to do that,
we need her missing pieces.
Pearl and Mom rebelled together,
so she's gotta rebel with you.
We've gotta stage
some big, dramatic event,
something to jog her memory,
like... like...
Like a rock show!
Like a rock show!
Like a rock show?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Right this way, citizens.
Ticker holder or evacuee?
Who's here for the show?!
Who's here 'cause it's
the end of the world?!
Wait, what?
This first song's a special
request from Steven Universe!
Ah!
This has gotta bring
Pearl's memories back.
It's all about quitting
a crummy service job.
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.
Thank you for gracing me
with your presence.

- Aah!

You did it!
Steven?
Wait.
Spinel!
Steven, are you okay?
D-Don't worry about me.
It's Spinel.
We need her to remember
how to stop her injector.
Ugh! Pearl, what do you know
about her?
Spinel? She was Pink Diamond's
little playmate.
They used to spend ages
together in Pink's garden...
- Garden?
- That's where they used to play.
So, what's her problem
with us?
I don't know. I haven't seen her
in 6,000 years.
Something must have happened
to her since then.
Then that's what I need
to find out.
Whoa, kiddo, are you sure
you don't need a break?
It looks like that fusion
took everything out of you.
I've gotta do what I can
with the little I have left.
I'm going after Spinel.
Steven, wait!
Oh, Steven, some stragglers
are missing from the shelters!
Did you see
a pink Gem run by?
Thanks.
Just this morning,
everything was perfect.
Why did everything
have to change?
I want my happily
ever after back.
That might be her.
Go find Connie.
We need all hands on deck.
Spinel?
What's wrong?
I just started
getting these feelings
flooding back to me.
That's... That's good.
I need you to remember.
If you don't, something really
bad will happen
to me and my home.
Please, think!
Do you remember
the garden?
The garden?
Is anything
coming back to you?
No!
Spinel,
where are we going?
Back...
to where I never left.
Spinel!
This was our garden.
A special world,
built just for Pink and I.
On Homeworld,
Pink was so lonely and sad,
but not here.
Here, we would play for hours.
Every day was so much fun.
At least...
that's what I thought.
Did something happen?
Pink wanted a colony
more than anything.
One day, her wish came true!
Blue and Yellow gave Pink
her very own planet...
Earth!
I was so excited!
A brand-new place to play.
So, why didn't you
go with her?

S-Spinel, you've...
you've got your memories back.
I can't believe
Mom did that to you.
Actually, I can
totally believe it.
You're not the only
one she hurt.
Rraah!
Yeah, you must know all
about her life without me!
Rub it in, why don't ya?!
No!
It's not like that!
You deserve
a better friend.
Spinel, come back
and save the Earth with me.
You can start over there,
make new friends.

Guys!
Guess who's back?
- Come on down.
- Won't they all be...
not exactly incredibly thrilled
to see me like this?
We just have
to talk to them.
Ta-da!
W-W-W-W-What?!
Oh, Spinel, did you
change your hair?
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Spinel got her memories back,
but she's not gonna hurt us.
Everything's chill.
Aah!
Hah! I'm here!
Where's the fight?!
Don't fight!
Everything's chill!
Aah. Alright, alright.
I'll wash my hands.
Whew. Okay.
Spinel, can I
ask you a favor?
Are you kidding?
Anything.
- That sounds bad.
- That looks bad.
That is bad.
We're hitting
critical mass.
Then I guess
we're just in time.
Aah!
Steven!
What's the status on Spinel?
She's back,
and she's here to help.
Okay, can someone
fill me in?
Thanks, Spinel.
Aw, gee.
What are friends for?
Okay, we've almost
cleaned up this mess.
Now all we need are Garnet's
memories and my powers,
and we can all get back
to living happily ever after.
What could work for Garnet?
Something about fusion,
something about love...
What about me?
Huh?
Is that
all you needed me for?
To turn off my injector?
No. Well...
sort of, but...
Well, what now?
I-I did what you wanted.
- That's it?
- Well, yeah.
We can just... forget
this whole thing ever happened.
How you gonna forget
with me around?
I'm the source
of all your problems.
Don't pretend
you want me here.
What's your plan for me, huh?
You gonna put me somewhere?
You gonna leave me somewhere?
You gonna leave me alone?
Spinel.
Rraah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Oh, what's this?
G-Garnet,
d-don't touch that!
Why do you have that?
I-I was just carrying it.
I-I didn't have anywhere else
to put it.
"We can just forget
this ever happened."
You mean I can just
forget this ever happened!
Wow!
What a plan!
I turn off the injector,
and then the moment
my back is turned...
Bam! Presto! Change-o!
Problem solved!
Well, think again.
You're not getting rid of me
that easy.
Run for it!
I'm not letting you get one
over on me, Steven Universe.
I wasn't going to wipe
your memories, Spinel.
You expect me to believe
that you want me like this?
Steven?
Why are you fighting?
Aren't we all friends?
Looks like we've still got
an audience.
- How about a front-row seat?
- Garnet!
You know,
this is pretty twisted,
but I'm a little flattered
that you liked the old me...
innocent, loving, stupid.
If that's your thing, why
don't you leave her like this?
Get away from her.
Oh, you're so protective
of your real friends,
and you're so careless
with your fake ones!
- Stop it.
- Then stop me!
You wanna attack me.
Just admit it.
Or better yet,
just try it!
- No!
- Why not?
Because that's not
the truth!
The truth.
I've known hardships
and confusion,
but love can live
through it all,
if you face the truth together.
Her final piece.
No. Stop!

I don't wanna play anymore.
Spinel,
this isn't a game!
Huh?
You know, I came here
to take my anger out
on a bunch of strangers,
but now that I know you,
I wanna kill you even more.
I don't get it!
Huh?
Why aren't my powers back?
Aren't I reliving
every horrible thing
that's ever happened to me?
A Gem I barely know
is trying to kill me.
I'm paying for stuff my Mom did
that had nothing to do with me.
I'm struggling with my powers.
The world's about to end!
What piece
could I be missing?
This is the story
of my life!
Wow! I knew I was gonna
set you back,
but this is how you started?
The legend,
Steven Universe?
You gotta be kidding me.
How did a powerless loser
like you
become savior of the galaxy?!
I changed.
That's the final piece.
All those struggles,
I learned from them, and I grew.
Oh, my gosh.
It's not just my gem powers
I've forgotten.
All this
happily ever after stuff
has made me forget
the first power I ever had...
the power to change.

entertaining.
You actually liked me,

What am I doing?
Why do I wanna

I'm supposed

I just wanna
be a friend.
Spinel.
- Steven! - Steven!
- Steven!
Whoa.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
What did I do?
I've wrecked everything.
Well, that's one way
to get rid of your injector.
But what about the poison?
What about the planet?
What about
your happily ever after?
There's no such thing
as happily ever after.
I'll always have
more work to do.
I'm sorry.
- Steven?
- Connie?
Steven!
Where are you?
Connie!
I'll be right back.
Really.
We saw that huge explosion
and...
I-I'm okay. I'm okay.
What about you?
I'm fine.
Lion!

Sure seems that way.
- Steven! - Steven! - Steven!
- Steven!
Guys! Dad!
Is everyone from
Beach City okay?
Everyone is safe
and accounted for.
Dad, your arm.
Hey, I just got
a little careless and...
Don't worry. You'll be
good as new in no time.
But, Steven,
you don't have your...
Mwah!
Steven!
You got your powers back!
It'd be cool if you could
do that to the whole planet.
Amethyst,
that's not a bad idea.
Dude, I was joking.
M-m-m-m-mwah!
Oh, my gosh.
That actually worked?
Hmm.
Looks like I got
a lotta kissin' to do.
Should we lend him a hand?
We should probably
get him some water.
Staying hydrated
is very important
when it comes to smooching.
Huh?
Spinel, wait!
I really was
going to come back.
I know.
Then w-where
are you going?
I've got work to do.
Friendship isn't going
to be easy for me.
I'm gonna have
to work at it.
You make me wanna try,
but...
I've already
messed up bad with you.
I wish I could just start
from scratch with somebody.
Spinel, I...
Huh?
Wha-a-a?!
Knock, knock, Steven.
It's us.
The Diamonds?
Are we interrupting
something?
Uh... yeah!
Yellow, Blue, White,
what are y'all doing here?
Well, Steven, we were
all talking and...
I'm sorry, but
what is that smell?
I don't smell anything.
Ugh. That's 'cause
you live here.
Anyway, we were talking,
and we decided...
This is taking too long!
Steven!
We've come to Earth
to live with you-u-u!
What? My house isn't big enough
for all of us.
Oh, well, I'm sure we could
make do with, um...
Has your planet
always been this...
destroyed?
- Not that we're judging.
- Goodness, no.
Because judging anything
based on appearance is wrong!
Yeah, I don't know
about this.
But, Steven, it's been so boring
since you've left!
I guess we'll just wait for you
to visit us
whenever you're ready.
Aw, come on.
Don't be like that.
I-It's just, I'm right in the
middle of saying goodbye to...
Do you guys remember Spinel?
I'm sorry, who?
Spinel, you've met
the Diamonds before, right?
Y-Yeah, but they've never
seen me like this.
Blue, Yellow, White,
this is Spinel.
My Diamonds.
Pink's little playmate?
One of Pink's
lost treasures.
Mom left her
on a floating garden in space.
You poor thing.
Aw, it was only
6,000 years.
I could do that
standing on my head!
Only 6,000 years!
It's true, that's nothing!
And that goofy headstand.
I like this Gem.
She's adorable,
and so much like Pink.
Spinel, I...
Steven, since the Earth
is so disgusting,
we'll just take Spinel
back to Homeworld with us
and you can stay here.
