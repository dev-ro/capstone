Good morning.
In less than 48 hours,
man will embark
on his first trip to the moon
with the hope of landing there.
As tensions over the war
in Vietnam continue to escalate,
the eyes of the world are
on Cape Kennedy,
where crews are working
around the clock
to prepare Apollo 11 for launch.
After a four-day journey
in space,
astronauts Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin
are scheduled to set foot
on the moon's surface
late Sunday night, July 20th,
Eastern Daylight Time.

Hey, Joiner.
Ain't it about time
for a Slim Jim?
What the hell's he got?
Joiner?
Looks like our friends left us
another little surprise.
Nice catch.
All right.
Thanks, Joiner.
Damn.
Thanks, Joiner.
- How does he do it?
- Thanks, Joiner.
Hey, tell Jane
to stop banging her professors
and get that next care package
in the mail.
Do you ever shut up?
Make sure she throws
in some Cheez Whiz too.
Thanks, Joiner.
Hey, come on, Wright,
why don't you finish your story?
Where was I?
You were up on
the Ferris wheel with Miss Ohio
in a tight satin dress, tiara,
the whole package.
Come on.
Yes, of course.
So we're riding along, you know,
she's looking at me,
I'm looking at her,
that kind of thing, and...
just when we reached the top-
Bam!
- Jesus Christ.
- Son of a bitch stops.
Big deal, they always stop.
Let people on and off the ride.
No, I mean dead.
Whole gear got sheared off
or something.
There we are, me and Miss Ohio,
about a mile high,
looking down on all these
incredible lights,
full moon above us,
crowd of people below.
Yeah, keep going.
She looks into my eyes,
and there's this
really heavy vibe going on.
Next thing I know,
sash comes off.
She's unzipping her dress
and her hands are all over me,
I mean, like, all over me.
That's my boy.
I been on the Ferris wheel
back home a thousand times.
How come nothing like that
ever happened to me?
Oh, sure it did.
It was your own hands
all over you.
Don't laugh.
That's not funny.
Don't laugh.
That's not funny.
It's not funny.
Don't laugh.
Joiner, what is the point
of night watch?
Claymores are set,
take care of any bad guys
creeping around out there.
HQ, this is Jolly Two.
We'd like a large pepperoni
with extra cheese,
and make it snappy, would you?
Ah, come on.
That was funny.
Not even a smile?
Wright?
Will you please
just shut the hell up?
HQ, this is Jolly Two!
The bush is live!
The bush is live!
More firepower
and immediate evac requested!
Copy, Jolly Two.
Order of evac en route.
I'm out!
I'm out.
Oh, God.
Shit.
You guys okay?
About damn time.
- Stay with me.
- Okay.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
We got a hawk 9-2.
We're setting down now.
LZ is clear!
Dee dee mow!
Hang in there, Burns,
you're gonna be all right.
Guys, we really got to go.
On three.
One, two-
- Shit!
- Joiner!
You okay, buddy?
I'm fine!
I'm fine!
Just lift, lift!
Move, move.
Get 'em out of there!
Heh.
Eh, bulletproof, my ass.
What about Burns?
They're shipping him to Da Nang.
Get him stabilized,
and then he's going home.
What about you?
You okay?
Ah, shit.
It doesn't make sense.
I mean, yeah, her letters
and packages slowed down,
but she had midterms
and then finals.
Michigan's a big jump
from high school
in Hammond, Indiana, you know?
I mean...
but this?
This isn't Jane.
You know, we've got this plan.
We've always had our plan.
You think it was another guy-
- Don't even say it.
I'm sorry, man.
What the hell am I gonna do now?
Get a new plan.

Now listen up.
You already know the drill,
but I'm gonna say it again
anyway.
Everything you say
and everything you do
reflects back on each

and our entire country.
Just remember, gentlemen:
Get drunk,
fall in love,
whatever floats your boat,
but one week from today,
0800 hours,
your asses better be here.
Do I make myself clear?
I said do I make myself clear?
All: Yes, sir!
Dismissed.
Get out of here.
Hallelujah.
Okay, first stop, Madam Wu's.
One price gets you the chick,
the booze, and the room.
That'll be home base.
Hookers and booze?
Now we talking.
From there we'll spread out,
do some reconnaissance
and if the situation warrants-
meaning the level of chick is
significantly better elsewhere-
we'll change locale.
Now, Joiner definitely
needs a pro.
Where the hell is he?
Damn it, Joiner.
Ahh.
Let's go find him.
No, no, you guys go.
I'll get Joiner.
He's probably on the phone
making a total ass of himself.
Right behind you.
Hey, hey.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm going back to see Jane.
Jane is gone.
You can't just get on a plane
back to the States
in the middle of the damn war
'cause you miss your girlfriend.
You heard Johnson.
One week from today, 0800.
I'll be here.
Military fly free.
This is not a joke, man.
That's how close I came
to being a dead man.
It's a freakin' half inch.
Now I got a second chance,
and I'm sure as hell
not gonna blow it
by screwing around in Hong Kong
for a week.
Oh, I get it,
so instead you're gonna risk
blowing the rest of your life.
Go AWOL and you're done.
Whatever you do, that's always
gonna be on your record.
I'm only AWOL
if I don't get back on time.
You got dumped.
That's a drag,
and you're upset, okay?
I'm sorry.
But believe me
when I tell you this:
There are a million
other girls out there
with all the same parts
in all the same places.
But there's only one Jane.
She's just a girl, man,
a girl who-
I'm sorry, but I believe you
need to hear this again,
'cause it's clearly
not sinking in-
she doesn't want
to see you anymore.
I'll see you next week.
Astronauts report it feels good.
T- minus 25 seconds.
Hey, Wright.
- 20 seconds and counting.
- Come here.
T-minus 15 seconds.

where you were
when those boys landed
on the moon.
Yes, sir.
3, 3, 1, 0.
You mind if I take
the window seat?
What are you doing here?
Military fly free.
No, Wright, I'm serious.
You got to get off the plane.
Hey, couldn't abandon my buddy.
Not to mention, if someone's
gonna pull off a stunt like this
and live to tell about,
you can be damn sure
it's gonna be me.
It's not a stunt, Wright.
Man, the guys are gonna shit
when they hear about this.
You thirsty?
I'm thirsty.
Quit hittin' it.
One day at a time.
That's how you survive.
So many nights sitting ambush,
not knowing who's gonna come
bursting out of those trees,
not knowing if it's gonna
be your last.
Man, if I would've known
that it was gonna end up
like this,
here in the clouds
with two of the loveliest angels
I've ever laid eyes on...
Hell, Uncle Sam could have kept
all my Purple Hearts
and Bronze Stars.
This is reward enough.
Duty calls.
We'll talk later.
Okay.
"Whoo, boy, I gotta hand it
to you, Wright,
you're one smooth operator."
"Oh, hey, thanks.
It was nothing, really.
"I was just looking out
for my buddy here,
"thought he might appreciate me
fixing us up
"with a couple of stewardesses.
It's my pleasure, really.
I mean-".
She got scared.
The blonde or the brunette?
Jane.
It was easier for her
to break things off
than it was to worry
about whether or not
I was gonna come back alive.
And once I show her
that I'm fine,
that nothing's gonna happen
to me over there,
she-she'll come around.
Look, Joiner, I just want you
to be prepared-
- We promised each other
that we wouldn't get officially
engaged until I got back.
You know, we didn't want
to jinx anything, but...
I'm thinking maybe
she needs that.
You know,
something to hang on to,
to help her
get through it alone.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
That's great, man.
That's a great idea.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Apollo 11 has escaped
Earth's orbit,
and it's all systems go.
I know you'll join us
in wishing the crew
the best of luck on their
historic journey to the moon.
