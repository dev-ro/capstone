This year, because
it's her own show,
and she's got such long sets,
it's more, like, I worry
about her.
I'm totally proud.
She's an amazing performer.
But still, as a mom,
it's, like, so nerve-racking.
This year, so that
doesn't happen,
they kinda put me to work,
so, actually, every time
she changes clothes,
um, I'm the one backstage
changing her clothes.
(clock winds, ticking)
It's crazy.
There's three of us
that, I think, because...
they're pretty timid
with, you know, her,
'cause they don't her,
I'm rippin' her clothes off,
and it's so funny.
She's like, "Mom."
We, of course, banter
back and forth.
You know,
it's so funny
back there,
because there's one change,
I have to get her changed
in, what, 30 seconds?
37 seconds
I think is...
We literally -
It has to be
choreographed
to where we know
what we take off first -
(Miley) Left foot,
right foot in,
skirt out first.
And then we have hair
and makeup people, who,
while we're changing her,
they're, like, trying to do
a little bit with her hair,
and, you know,
that's crazy.

Miley Cyrus?

What Miley writes about
is what is real to her
and what she lives.
When you hear the things
that she writes,
you hear the honesty
of Miley's heart.
I mean, it's -
The music is real,
and the songs
that she writes about
is what she lives.
And, uh, that's what,
you know,
that's what I love
about her music
is that it's real.
This song was written
for my granddad
who passed away
just a few years ago,
but, uh, he's never really
gone to me and my family,
'cause he's here with me
every night onstage.
This is a song that I wrote
just for him.
So this one goes to
my guardian angel, my Pappy.
