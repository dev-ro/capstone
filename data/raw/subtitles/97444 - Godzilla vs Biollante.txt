"Godzilla vs. Biollante"
(Gojira tai Biorante)
I've found something!
Who's there?
This area is off-limits!
REPUBLIC OF SARADIA
Where are you going at
this time of night?
I have to go to the lab.
I just received a call saying that
the Godzilla cells have arrived.
They must be quick-frozen.
I'll be back for dinner.
{\i1}You didn't have to come with me Erica.{\i0}
Dad it's okay. You know you
can't do anything without me.
SARADIA INSTITUTE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
See you later Dad.
I'll meet you in the lab.
Erica!
{\i1}Miki Saegusa age 17...{\i0}
{\i1}She is the best psychic we have at the
Mental Science Exploration Center.{\i0}
{\i1}It has been shown
through numerous tests...{\i0}
{\i1}... that plants have their own
fields of mental energy.{\i0}
{\i1}It comes as no surprise that
we've finally found someone...{\i0}
FIVE YEARS LATER
{\i1}... who can communicate with them.{\i0}
Tell me doctor why do you suddenly
wish to hear the voice of a rose?
I guess it's a sign of old age.
I've lived here alone for
over five years now.
I guess solitude has given
me some strange ideas.
{\i1}Has it really been five years?{\i0}
Erica said that one day the desert would come
to life carpeted with all kinds of wild flowers.
How is your father Asuku?
He's fine.
His latest project is to start a bio-bank.
He's trying to get the Foundation to fund it.
Yes I've heard of your father's
project and how he wants to...
...preserve the sperm of Nobel Prize winners
for the production of future geniuses.
There's been a lot of opposition to
his project but it's still going ahead.
It won't be easy to get
his work accepted.
You see those same kinds of attitudes
forced me to leave the country.
Some things haven't
changed in five years.
How did you do?
It wasn't any good.
I got nothing.
We'll see you later.
Thanks for stopping by.
Did you hear something just now?
A girl was calling you Asuka.
It was your name I'm sure of it.
Goodbye...
{\i1}Have you ever heard of a chimera?{\i0}
{\i1}Chimera?{\i0}
{\i1}It's a legendary monster
that breathes fire.{\i0}
{\i1}It's supposed to appear from the ocean's depths
causing storms and destroying human beings.{\i0}
It has a lion's head a goat's
body and a dragon's tail.
But wasn't it a mythical creature?
{\i1}If genetic engineers keep playing with cells
they may create their very own chimera.{\i0}
A new like form totally alien and completely
different from what God intended for earth.
Frightening huh?
I understand how you feel about my father's
work and many people are against it as well.
But I can't help it if my father is the
head of the Ecology Foundation.
I don't see how our relationship
has anything to do with it.
You're right but I'm still
uneasy about my work.
After all the Foundation
supports the labs.
Yes but that doesn't
affect our being together.
You act like Romeo
from Shakespeare's play.
Well you won't catch me
portraying your Juliet...
Massachusetts sent me an answer.
They want me to study there.
Asuka will you come with me?
I don't know what to say...
I can't give you an answer now.
{\i1}Last night a series of violent tremors has shaken
the area around Mt. Mihara on Oshima Island.{\i0}
{\i1}Early this morning smoke has
been seen rising from the crater.{\i0}
{\i1}The Central Seismic Bureau is
monitoring the situation...{\i0}
{\i1}But at this stage they are
unsure if a full eruption is likely.{\i0}
I first heard it from two
children a few days ago.
Now they all say they had the
same dream last night.
Did you?
It started a week ago and every night
since then it has become more clear.
Well have you finished?
Yes!
Well then show us what
you've dreamed about!
Yes!
NATIONAL LAND BUREAU

GODZILLA UNIT
{\i1}This is Gondo...{\i0}
It's you Colonel!
Yes it's really exciting to wait
for a lizard that never shows up!
You must be joking Colonel!
They must be trying
to replace me!
The most exciting thing that happens around
here is betting on who kills the most mosquitoes!
{\i1}Sure! God only knows why I
accepted this assignment.{\i0}
By the way...
I called you because I wanted to conduct some
research and for that I'll need your cooperation.
I understand
tomorrow at 10:30.
Godzilla's awake!
{\i1}First Alarm System: In case of
chemical geological meteorological...{\i0}
{\i1}... or other than a physical sign
of G's action is confirmed.{\i0}
PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE
{\i1}I don't think the Prime
Minister believes her story.{\i0}
No of course not.
She's just a nobody.
If he started believing girls
talking about dreams and ESP...
...he wouldn't be Prime
Minister for too long.
So Gondo do you believe
what she's saying?
The truth is
I hope it shows up...
If it doesn't
I'll be out of a job...
{\i1}Top Secret: First Stage

Robotic engineering...
Computers...
Super-conductivity...
Laser technology...
All of the latest gadgets
are at our disposal...
...including ESP.
The army is really up to date.
Aren't they?
You've forgotten one thing.
What's that?
You didn't mention
our bio-weapons.
{\i1}Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria?{\i0}
TSUKUBA LABORATORY
OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
{\i1}Already in the United States...{\i0}
{\i1}... they've created a bacteria
that can eat crude oil.{\i0}
It's been successfully
tested on the oil spills.
Likewise...
...bacteria that can eat nuclear material
has been developed by our scientists here.
In case of a nuclear accident...
...the bacteria would clean
up any radioactive pollution.
It eats... nuclear material?
Of course and that's why it would work against
Godzilla who feeds upon nuclear energy.
Well the situation
isn't critical yet.
True an orange alert has been issued
and the bacteria must be readied...
But the bacteria wasn't meant
to be used as a weapon.
Not yet...
Well the problem is that the bacteria can't
be produced in this laboratory on its own...
We need a Godzilla
cell to create it.
A Godzilla cell?
Godzilla feeds on nuclear energy...
Somewhere in its cell structure lies
a nuclear-digesting set of genes.
We need that set of genes
to make the bacteria.
So you're saying that...
...something taken from Godzilla's cells can
be made into something that can destroy it?
The Godzilla cells were found five years ago.
They were collected by an army special unit.
They're stored at
the Okochi Foundation.
Will you need anything else Doctor?
Just a few scientists...
I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen but I
vowed never to work with Godzilla cells again.
I understand how you
must feel Doctor...
...but it's vital for the defense
of our country against Godzilla.
My daughter was more important
to me than my country.
I lost her because of my
work with Godzilla cells.
Now I have nothing left to live for.
Thank you but I must refuse.
OKOCHI FOUNDATION
So you're Dr. Kirishima?
My daughter has told me a lot about you.
I'm glad that we could finally meet.
My daughter also told me that you're
a little critical about our work here.
Extremely...
Well at least you're honest.
However I feel that you like the other
scientists don't know what I'm doing here.
I do realize the dangers involved
after all every coin has two sides...
In that case you must realize
what kind of weapon the...
...Anti-Nuclear Bacteria would be.
Are you aware of it?
I know that it could neutralize
nuclear missiles.
Nuclear weapons would be
rendered useless overnight.
If we create that bacteria
the balance of power...
Kirishima reality is reality.
This Foundation now has the
technology to make that bacteria.
The superpowers of the world would do
anything to get hold of the Godzilla cells.
If any country succeeded I'd have
to use force to recover the cells.
The same way the
American Bio-Major...
...attacked and destroyed
Shiragami's lab 5 years ago.
The government decided to store the Godzilla
cells here in this vault as a precaution.
They would remain in here
and only be used...
...in case of a nuclear emergency
that would threaten the country.
And only under strict control!
But then Godzilla came along...
...and the rest is history.
As for myself I hate the idea
of the cells being locked up.
These are the Godzilla cells?
Japan was devastated by nuclear
bombs and we now have Godzilla...
It's only fair that we use it as a weapon
that will protect us from our enemies.
An earthquake?
{\i1}A powerful eruption occurred at Mt. Mihara
on Oshima Island a short time ago...{\i0}
{\i1}It caused a series of tremors that
were felt throughout the Kanto region.{\i0}
{\i1}The eruptions are still occurring...{\i0}
{\i1}... throwing lava high into the night sky
and giving the scene an eerie glow...{\i0}
I must do something
or Erica will die!
I see...
Dr. Shiragami welcome to the team!
Thank you.
Shiragami has accepted the position?
Really? He's coming here tomorrow?
What?
Yes on one condition. He wants
to keep the Godzilla cells...
...in his lab for seven days.
Of course I told him it was okay.
So what are you going to be doing?
Will you be creating the
bacteria with Dr. Shiragami?
Yes to destroy Godzilla
when it returns.
It sounds as if you want
Godzilla to show up.
Maybe but who knows if
Godzilla will ever appear again...
What if we create the bacteria
and it's just a false alarm?
I'd be happy if I never
saw Godzilla again!
I'm not joking. We would have created
something as terrible as Godzilla.
{\i1}I know that it's just a simple bacteria
we're creating via genetic engineering...{\i0}
But if the research continues
at its present course...
...genetic technology will produce
something far worse than Godzilla!
Kirishima...
If we don't produce this bacteria
someone else is sure to do it!
Just look at what humans have done
in the past centuries and you'll see.
I know that!
But our responsibility...
Kirishima I don't believe you
understand science very well.
You can see there's not a lot of movement
but something is happening down there!
{\i1}Second Alarm System: In case any physical sign of
G's action such as voice and motion is confirmed.{\i0}
{\i1}The Super-X2 has been substantially
improved with the installation of...{\i0}
{\i1}... the latest on-board supercomputer that
controls automatic and remote functions.{\i0}
It's also submersible capable of operating
at such extreme depths as 10000 meters.
Its armor is also the latest TA-32.
It's twice as durable as the
titanium-alloy on the Super-X.
Right. This way please.
That is called the Fire-Mirror.
It was completely constructed
with synthetic diamonds.
If the mirror is hit with
Godzilla's radioactive breath...
...it will return its
attack a thousand-fold.
Pretty powerful!
Yes it is.
It's already started.
I've always been fascinated
with cell division.
Two cells in 30 minutes doubling to
4 in an hour... 32 cells in two hours.
In one day 4 million cells.
{\i1}Terrifying isn't it?{\i0}
{\i1}This is Kirishima...{\i0}
What?! Dr. Shiragami's lab?!
{\i1}The bodies belong to two
of Bio-Major's agents.{\i0}
{\i1}They broke in to steal the
Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria data.{\i0}
{\i1}God only knows how they died...{\i0}
Is this why you've been keeping the
Godzilla cells in your lab all this week?
During the experiment I thought I
created an immortal plant species.
I gave it self-reproducing
abilities using Godzilla cells.
You did what?!
I thought...
I think I may have made a mistake.
"And demand that you turn over all
Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria data..."
"...to us no later than 2:00
on Tuesday the 31st..."
"...or we will cause an explosion on Mt. Mihara
that will destroy it completely and free Godzilla."
It was faxed to us.
We received it this morning.
The name of the
organization is "ALIEN"?
Unbelievable...
It's Bio-Major!
They're the only ones who would know
about the Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria.
Yeah it's a bluff.
The Prime Minister?
He's been too busy and more worried
about the opposition parties than Godzilla.
Well they're not bluffing.
That was a call from Mt. Mihara. There was
an explosion but it was just a warning.
A warning?
Read the rest you'll understand.
There's more to the message.
"We've already made preparations
to prove that we mean business..."
"We shall set off a warning explosion by remote
control at 2:00 24 hours before the deadline."
They're holding the entire
country for ransom!
And Godzilla is their hostage...
Slow down...
This looks like the place.
{\i1}Deliver the bacteria to Bio-Major?{\i0}
I understand...
If that's what the
government has decided...
Whatever you say sir.
Doctor...
You see? Science is just
another host for politicians.
So you're going to leave it to them?
We can't just sit here
and do nothing!
{\i1}Dr. Shiragami!{\i0}
Come to the lake!
I don't believe it!
What you see is no ordinary plant.
That is Biollante.
Biollante?
The spirit of a plant that
appears in Norse mythology.
{\i1}But that plant has a human spirit.{\i0}
A human spirit?
Doctor I believe Erica's
spirit is in there!
How do you know?
I can hear her calling me.
Asuka I'll need your help.
You did it. You spliced one
of Godzilla's cells...
...with one of the plant's cells.
Are you proud of this?
What kind of science
do you call it?!
What was he doing?
He was crazy to start playing
with the Godzilla cells.
I don't know what scientists
are trying to do nowadays.
It's way beyond me.
You have it?
{\i1}You'd better get moving 'ALIEN".{\i0}
The switch is in the container.
So it's a double-cross?!
You damned idiot!
We've got to throw the switch!
There's no time left!
Saradia?
We've got to get this open!
I know! The key!
He got away with the bacteria!
Forget it!
The switch is broken!
Amen!
{\i1}Third Alarm System:
In case G appears.{\i0}
Godzilla is back again...
And we lose the
anti-nuclear energy bacteria.
I guess things are about
as bad as they can get.
Well you miserable people of Tokyo...
I'm glad you tuned in
because this show has...
We have a special report
please stay tuned.
In the United States new laws were...
Just a moment...
This just in... An explosion has occurred on Mt.
Mihara. Godzilla has escaped and is still at large.
So Godzilla is back again?
Doctor we must return to Tokyo!
Biollante is crying
I can hear her.
{\i1}The Coast Guard in the
Tokyo Bay area...{\i0}
{\i1}... is warning the residents in Godzilla's
path and is evacuating the area.{\i0}
We have just received these pictures.
Godzilla is slowly on the move.
{\i1}It has left Oshima Island and is
heading in the direction of Tokyo.{\i0}
OPERATIONS CENTER
SELF-DEFENSE AGENCY
At this rate Godzilla will reach
Tokyo in 24 hours.
Super-X2 proceed
to runway. Confirmed.
{\i1}Super-X2 proceed to runway.{\i0}
Colonel Kuruki reporting for duty sir!
Super-X2 was assigned to me in
our operation against Godzilla.
I see you're from a
new youth-elite corp.
Yes sir!
All on-board systems showing
normal speed Mach 1.
It will be arriving
in ten minutes.
Switch to the X2 cameras.
Roger.
Activate the Fire-Mirrors.
Home in on the sensors.
Fire-Mirrors set on.
Godzilla is turning west!
Colonel Kuruki a
phone call for you.
Yes this is Kuruki.
Oh it's you Gondo.
What?! They stole the
anti-nuclear bacteria?!
Close all the airports?
I understand. Alright.
I recommend waiting before
giving the all-clear.
Inform the press that we're still
fighting Godzilla in the Yuraga Channel.
Kuruki are you suggesting
that we should lie?
{\i1}Your attention please. The airport is closing
down due to the advance of Godzilla.{\i0}
{\i1}This just in... Godzilla has stopped its
advance between Yabura and Tachiyama.{\i0}
{\i1}Haneda and Narita airports
are closed until further notice.{\i0}
The agent's car has been spotted!
He's on the Tomei highway heading west!
Tomei?
Where could he be going?
Saradia Oil Corporation based in Osaka
run by a former secret-agent of theirs.
It's a front for their
spying activities.
Every week a freighter in
Kobe leaves for Saradia.
So you think they'll
smuggle it out by sea?
If we could retrieve the bacteria
we can defeat Godzilla.
Then we'll have an almost
endless supply of Godzilla cells.
I see but Dr. Shiragami is...
Dr. Shiragami...
Excuse me I'm from TNN TV.
I'd like to talk
to you for a moment.
I've heard that your experiment successfully
combined the cells of a plant with Godzilla cells...
...to create a super-plant.
Dr. Shiragami!
You people always criticize scientific experiments
without understanding their true value.
Scientists must look toward the future!
It's no longer Erica's
spirit Doctor.
I can't read it anymore.
I'm shut out.
Then Biollante is...
Biollante is just a cross
between a plant and Godzilla.
What is it?
Godzilla?
Godzilla! Biollante is
calling for Godzilla!
Godzilla is turning north toward
Adowara. What shall I do sir?
Keep it in the water
away from the coast.
Understood...
Begin underwater attack.
The mirror's reflection
rate has dropped to 40%.
The Fire-Mirror is melting!
We can't control the
lasers as well!
Incredible!
{\i1}The mirror is heat-proof
but not like the TA-32 armor.{\i0}
{\i1}Switching to missile attack.{\i0}
It's out of control!
I think Super X-2 is out of action.
Can you bring it home?
I'll try my best.
{\i1}Godzilla has finally
landed on the east coast...{\i0}
{\i1}... and is heading toward Lake Hashi.{\i0}
{\i1}Repeating Godzilla has landed on the
coast and is heading toward Lake Hashi.{\i0}
{\i1}The 31st and 34th regiments have
arrived at the southern end of the lake...{\i0}
{\i1}They are taking up
defensive positions.{\i0}
Doctor!
Get inside it's too
dangerous out here!
Miki hurry! Doctor!
What's going on?
Our opponent thinks it
will win easily.
I wonder...
Did Godzilla come to see Biollante because it
knew they were made from the same cells?
Yes it's possible...
{\i1}They're both from the same family.{\i0}
{\i1}More than just the same family...{\i0}
They're both made from
the same cells.
They're identical two of a kind. Not brother
and sister they're the same creature.
Biollante is dying!
Godzilla's attack must have had an
abnormal effect on Biollante's cell division.
I guess it's not
immortal after all.
Godzilla is in Sagami Bay?
So it's out to sea?
Yes we're trying to fix it.
Sure... Right.
Well?
The computers tested out okay.
The remote control needs to be
replaced but that's expected.
However the Fire-Mirror
is out of action.
Can't you fix it?
It's badly deformed in
too many areas.
Godzilla's melted a mirror of synthetic diamond!
That's beyond our technological limits!
{\i1}This is Chopper Three
no signal on radar or sonar.{\i0}
{\i1}This is Chopper One
Godzilla is nowhere to be found.{\i0}
{\i1}Roger... All units standby.{\i0}
I want another sweep of Saraga
Bay and the surrounding area.
Understood.
If we lose Godzilla this time
we won't have another chance.
We are currently over the sea...
We will continue to search the bay and
coastal areas for as long as possible.
{\i1}Roger...{\i0}
{\i1}Continue your search pattern
at reference point 4-2-0-9-6-4.{\i0}
Doctor...
Miss Okochi Colonel Kuruki
wants you on the phone.
Is it possible that Miki can detect Godzilla
under water the way she did at the volcano?
I'm low on fuel. If we go any further
we won't make it back to Tokyo.
A little further please.
Okay we'll head for Osaka.
Okay.
It's here below us!
It's moving slowly.
Godzilla is heading west
100 kilometers off Hamamatsu.
The last time Godzilla attacked
it ate a lot of nuclear material...
...from an atomic plant
to store energy.
This time it doesn't have a
supply of nuclear material...
...and its battles with X2 and
Biollante used up a lot of its energy.
Do you think it will head
for an atomic plant?
What plants are nearest to it?
{\i1}One at Maizuru one at Obana
and three at Tsuruga.{\i0}
That makes five total a third
of all the plants in Japan.
If Godzilla went that way...
It would be a disaster if even
one of those plants is destroyed!
Judging by Godzilla's latest position
the nearest one would be here.
Nagoya!
We must organize our defenses.
Send a message...
I want Super-X2 sent into the bay.
I want air cover at all times and ground
troops on the three peninsulas around the bay.
Here is where we'll launch
our attack against Godzilla.
{\i1}An all-out attack at Ise Bay?{\i0}
Godzilla is just as likely to
come from Wakasa Bay.
What if they send everyone
in and it doesn't show?
It's an interesting question
but an important one.
{\i1}Godzilla has surfaced!{\i0}
{\i1}It's heading for Osaka!{\i0}
Send Super-X2 after it.
Understood.
Send the fleet to the
channel for battle.
Understood!
We must close the expressway
and send all troops to Osaka.
It's too late.
There's no time for that.
I know it's too late
but what else can we do?!
We must move all troops along
the Mishimi expressway...
...to prepare for a counterattack
in Wakasa against Godzilla.
If we go to Osaka
we won't have a chance...
But if we go to Wakasa
we might be able to beat it.
What happens to Osaka?!
My mission is to defeat Godzilla!
Its advance on Osaka
must be delayed.
You'll have to evacuate Osaka.
Contact Miss Okochi in Osaka.
Yes sir!

Miki!
Leave here please!
It's too dangerous!
Please do as I ask!
We were ordered to
stay with you!
I insist!
Hurry and get away!
What is this telepathy?
It's all in her mind!
It's absurd to think she
can defeat Godzilla!
This girl has been a
great help to us.
She might be able to delay
Godzilla's landing in Osaka!
I trust her ESP ability.
Miki!
The Navy has made it
to the channel.
They'll never make it. It's too close to
Osaka for them to use their cannons.
{\i1}Fourth Alarm System: In case G's
landing on any specific coast of Japan.{\i0}
{\i1}Ladies and Gentlemen we must cancel the concert
due to an emergency. Godzilla is approaching Osaka!{\i0}
{\i1}Please follow the Marshalls
instruction and evacuate the building!{\i0}
{\i1}Godzilla is expected to arrive
in Osaka from Osaka Bay.{\i0}
{\i1}All civilians are required to evacuate in accordance
with the instructions they receive on radio and TV.{\i0}
{\i1}Evacuate calmly and do not panic.{\i0}

Is anyone here?
What do you want?
We're criminals...
Yeah we're robbing this place.
And you...
There's only one way to
deal with his kind.
Run!
{\i1}Godzilla is passing the north side of Osaka park.
It's heading for the business district!{\i0}
Colonel Gondo has just left with a loaded
ANB Rocket Gun. He's on his way sir.
Good...
SuperX-2?
It's waiting at the
business district.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Right!
Attack Godzilla from the front. Try to lure
it over to the tall building on its right.
Can you do that without
using the Fire-Mirror?
Ready missiles and Gatling-guns!
I'll do my best...
Good! Keep it going!
We're out of missiles!
Colonel Gondo and his bazooka
troop are in position!
A little more...
Ready the Fire-Mirror.
What did you say?
The Fire-Mirror isn't
functioning properly!
Godzilla's not in
the proper position yet!
Fire!
We did it!
Okay pull out!
{\i1}Come in Colonel! Colonel Gondo!
Godzilla is approaching your position!{\i0}
{\i1}Repeat Godzilla is approaching
your position! Come in colonel!{\i0}
All of this intravenous
stuff is bad for you Godzilla!
Gondo!
{\i1}After landing in Osaka and
devastating the city...{\i0}
{\i1}... Godzilla has moved north to
the Tappa mountains.{\i0}
{\i1}She used as much energy as Godzilla.
It's no wonder why she's exhausted.{\i0}
She shouldn't have done it.
She could have died...
Yes?
It's a call for Mr. Kirishima.
Thanks.
Oh Kuruki...
Right... Right...
It's been over fourteen hours now...
There still doesn't seem to be
any change in Godzilla yet.
If the bacteria doesn't work in the
next eight hours we've had it.
Is that right? I understand...
I'll get a chopper and see you in Tokyo.
The Anti-Nuclear Bacteria should take
effect within six to twelve hours.
On the average it's only eight hours.
I don't understand why nothing's happened yet.
Maybe Godzilla is too large
for the dose we gave it.
No one should have been enough
and Godzilla got three.
One of them was fired in its mouth!
The dose was lethal...
I don't understand it.
Neither do I...
Ice blocks...?
The refrigeration is off.
When Godzilla attacked yesterday
it destroyed the power plant.
The hospital's generators
couldn't handle it.
What's wrong?
I wonder...
Godzilla's temperature?
Yes I think it has a
low body temperature.
Is that important?
We have no data concerning Godzilla's
body temperature so we don't know.
But why?
Bacteria breeds slower in low temperatures so the
lower the temperature the slower the reaction.
You mean the bacteria won't work
because it's a cold-blooded creature?
Yes it's possible.
So if we can raise
Godzilla's temperature...
Yes but how...?
The M-6000 TC system.
Kuruki!
TC system?
Thunder-control system.
It creates artificial thunder...
...causing high frequency waves
to create clouds then heat.
Like a giant microwave oven!
Kuruki we can't use that system
since it's still in its research stage!

seeding is completed.{\i0}
{\i1}Expect clouds in two hours.{\i0}
{\i1}The ground troops are nearly in position!{\i0}
{\i1}Go!{\i0}
{\i1}B- 4 installation ready!{\i0}
{\i1}B- 8 installation ready!{\i0}
{\i1}F- 2 installation ready!{\i0}
{\i1}Mobile war room...{\i0}
{\i1}... installation of all 100 generators
should be done within the hour.{\i0}
{\i1}It's hard to believe by
looking at his face...{\i0}
{\i1}... that he has such a huge
responsibility on his shoulders.{\i0}
I guess it's time for my
generation to step down.
From now on it's
up to you guys.
There's nothing special about our generation.
We make mistakes just like everyone.
The generators have been completed.
Now they have to be charged.
Good.
Godzilla is entering the TC field!
B-2!
You see? That must have raised
its temperature a little!
How hot is that?
So hot it could melt
an A-1 tank easily!
It's gone outside the TC field!
Keep it in!
It must not escape!
{\i1}Understood!
Commence firing!{\i0}
It's back in the field now!
Good.
{\i1}G- 4!{\i0}
Doctor?
You better start hoping
this idea will work.
If we can get Godzilla's temperature
high enough the bacteria should work.
Konaki what should we do?
Contact Yohama the nuclear plant.
Yes sir!
What are you two doing here?!
Biollante is still alive! Ask Miki!
What?!
Godzilla!
It's working! The bacteria's spreading!
It's true!
Bring in the helicopters.
This is incredible!
Could Godzilla be immune
to the bacteria?
It isn't possible!
Miki!
Hey where are you going?
Hey where is she going?
I don't know! Come on!
It's dangerous! Stay here!
{\i1}What's going on?{\i0}
{\i1}Something's jamming the system!{\i0}
Biollante...
Biollante...
She's evolving!
Biollante...
Look at Godzilla!
The bacteria has taken effect!
Congratulations Dr. Shiragami!
One day we'll put all of
this to good use.
Now we have to isolate samples of the
genes and put them into production at once.
I'm not continuing my work on bacteria.
Biollante has convinced me of that.
What's the matter?
You must continue your work doctor.
You've got all the Godzilla
cells you'll ever need!
Biollante and Godzilla aren't monsters it's
the arrogant scientists that create them.
Biollante!
Thank you...
Biollante said it.
Erica!
Doctor!
It's him!
You look like Batman.
How is the doctor?
The water must have
lowered its temperature!
Godzilla's going back to the sea...
Biollante has gone to the sky.
And this lucky couple is
going to America!
Thanks but I'm not going to America.
Why not?
Because wherever you go
people are the same.
There's good and bad in every country.
Then where will you go?
First...
...to bed I think.
I haven't slept for days!
Shall we go together?
From here on?
Always!
{\i1}How long have we been
living in such an age?{\i0}
{\i1}Maybe it started when man first stepped out of
the Garden of Eden and left his innocence behind.{\i0}
{\i1}Man would do well to
remember this day forever.{\i0}
