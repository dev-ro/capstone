An axe.
Fucking...
Son of a...
She's okay? She must
be fine. I trust you.
The Killer: A Girl Who Deserves to Die
Expert on Real Estate Tax Settlement
What is it?
Nothing.
Look in the mirror
and see if it's nothing.
So...
What's the favor?
Can you look after a kid?
What kid?
My friend's kid, the one
I'm going to Jeju with.
She has no one to look after her.
How old?
Seventeen.
And the husband?
She's divorced and he's not around.
She lived a tough life as a single mom.
But the kid's all grown up.
She'll be uncomfortable with me.
Tell her to stay at home.
Their home is so old, the roof
leaks, it needs a full renovation.
How long will it take?
About 3 weeks?
I see what's going on here.
Travel for 3 weeks,
renovation for 3 weeks.
She's scheming to leave her kid with me
while she's away on vacation!
Anyway, I'll give you
her number and address,
so pick her up after dropping
me off at the airport.
Tell her to use the guest
room on the 2nd floor.
Wait.
My house?
Not your house, our house!
You're going to let a
stranger into my house?
Shut it, that's enough.
Anyways, she's her precious kid,
so if she's hurt in any way,
you're dead.
I never had a choice.
Honey.
Did you go shooting again?
Yeah, I went shooting!
Jeez!
Be cooperative this time,
you'll get a free pass
for a few months.
Doesn't this look nice?
Looks so nice, it's been so long.
- I got a coupon.
- For real?
Eyes on the road.
Thank you so much.
I'll be right there.
You can do this.
I'll call you.
I'm off.
- Wait for me!
- Let's go, I'm so happy.
Kim Yoon-ji
My babysitter?
Kim Yoon-ji?
Get in.
Isn't this car expensive?
Yeah, a bit.
She's my friend, can she come with?
Hello.
I don't see why not.
Where to?
Hongik University.
I need to buy some books.
Hongik, I see.
Sure, let's go.
17 years old, puberty, a reckless age.
Adult physique with a kid's brain.
An immature human who
can't handle herself yet.
The reason she scares me is
no one knows what she'll do.
Sir, can I sleep over at her place?
That sounds good to me.
Don't tell my mom.
She'll get worried.
Call me if anything happens.
You can stay there a few more days.
Hongdae Entrance Station
Give me your wallet.
That's okay.
Don't be modest, give it to me.
Good.
Emergency money.
It's polite to buy a gift
when you visit someone,
so you can stay longer.
Buy something good to eat,
got it?
Thank you!
Let's go.
That's a bribe to stay away
from strange places,
so if you break it, penalty doubles.
Don't worry.
Very well.
Punk Kid 5
Hello?
Why won't you pick up?
Because it's past midnight...
What is it?
My stomach hurts.
Then you should go to the hospital.
Just come get me!
Fine, where are you?
Your dad?
Is he out of his mind?
Uncle.
Hello, I'm a senior at her school.
Nice to meet you.
Yoon-ji, I'll head home now.
Where do you live again?
We'll drop you off.
It's okay, I can take a cab.
Hey.
Yes?
Your stomach?
It doesn't hurt that much.
Then why did you
cry and wail like that?
I just want to go back to your house.
Dammit.
Where's your friend?
Weren't you sleeping there?
Group project and all.
Hey!
You can go home first.
You think I'm laughing?
I'm actually crying.
Are you messing with me?
Can I really leave?
Sure.
I'm really leaving.
Okay.
Fine, have a safe ride home, call me.
Don't worry.
Okay.
Hey, she's here, let's move.
Honey, the food here
is really delicious.
Are you getting along with her?
Give me your wallet.
Think of it as a gig.
Is it really that hard to help me?
It's nothing at all.
Close your eyes for an
hour and boom, $2,000.
If it's so good, then
why don't you do it?
She's too old to get much.
I doubt she can even get $200.
Shut your fucking mouth!
You're not the one
bringing the customers.
You only bring cheap ass perverts.
You want to get your ass kicked?
$2,000 since you're a virgin.
$500 if you're lucky afterwards.
Are you even a virgin?
Who cares if she's a
fucking virgin or not.
Just tell them you are.
You idiot,
business is based on trust.
Those perverts only go for virgins.
You don't think they'll notice?
That's why you're still where you are.
She's the one who brought you here.
I didn't even ask, but she
told me how to bait you.
Funny, eh?
You like him, right?
I never said that.
Then why did you agree to come
when she said he was here?
Please let us go...
Shut the fuck up.
I'm sure I don't have
to waste my breath.
Right?
Go fuck yourself, bitch.
You little shit!
That's enough.
She's not allowed to get hurt.
What the hell?
How the fuck did you find us?
What are you idiots waiting for?
You motherfucker!
Go outside.
Fucking asshole.
Sir.
Sir?
Sir.
I'm hungry.
Eat something then.
How old are you?
Get some food with what
I gave you yesterday.
Why don't you have a baby yet?
We don't want a baby.
You can't have kids?
So, how old are you?
42, happy?
Dang, you're older than my mom.
But you look mid-30's.
She's a good kid.
Are you an athlete?
Which sports?
This and that.
What do you do for a living?
Why?
Well, you got this nice
house and the car.
How did you become so rich?
A friend owns a few buildings,
I just manage them.
Real estate is the way to go.
If a manager makes this much...
Hey.
What do you plan to do?
I'm just going to stay here.
Damn it.
Don't you have a lot of friends?
I'm a bit of a loner at school.
What do you mean?
Alone? Loner?
Yeah, a big loner.
Keep moving!
Please keep moving!
You're blocking traffic, keep moving!
Please keep moving.
Hold on.
Good evening.
Hello.
Did something happen?
There was a murder.
A murder?
Teenagers got stabbed
in a roller skating rink.
Kids nowadays.
So, what can I do for you?
Do you pass by here often?
Sometimes, it's a shortcut.
I see.
Thanks for your cooperation, take care.
Okay, then.
"Five bodies of men found
in closed skating rink."
Hye-joo, are you okay?
Bad gut feeling didn't last a day.
Who is it?
Cop from yesterday.
Go upstairs.
Sorry to bother you again.
Why don't we chat over there?
Stunning house.
What brings you here?
This is just a routine check,
so no need to be nervous.
This was 30 minutes
before the incident.
Isn't this your vehicle?
I wasn't the only one
to drive through there.
Do you recognize this motorcycle?
I can't see very well at night.
It was right in front of
your car, don't remember?
Detective.
Do you remember the car
that you passed by just now?
Sorry?
Was it a sedan or a motorcycle?
Maybe it was a delivery bike?
One sec.
It was a truck.
1.5-ton truck.
You got me good this time.
You don't have any children,
who was the girl with you...
Did you do a background check on me?
Well, it is an investigation.
It's my wife's friend's daughter.
I'm babysitting her
while she's on vacation.
Is this Kim Yoon-ji?
I'm not sure.
Anyways, she was with me.
Can I speak with her for a bit?
Come back when you
have proof she's involved.
She's been bullied badly at school.
Involved in a few
school violence cases.
And with one of the dead...
Hey, Yoon-ji!
I think you should leave now.
Sure, I'll be off for now.
As a precaution,
don't travel anywhere far.
Sure.
You're not involved in their deaths.
Come and eat.
Sir...
Do you see me as one of them?
There was once a girl
who hired me to kill her.
Perhaps she lost something,
or had nowhere to go.
Any particular method?
I wish I could die without
feeling anything.
She looked on with blank eyes.
With her death before her,
she asked me for a favor.
She wanted me to
hug her, one last time.
So warm...
I didn't want to know
the pain she was feeling,
and I simply hugged
her without any thought.
At that last moment, she
said everything will be okay,
and patted me,
and asked me not to forget
this moment and smiled.
But why?
I became curious about her pain.
But I could never find out.
Only her warmth remained on my hand.
Hye-joo, are you all right?
Shit, you're curious?
If you want to save Hye-joo,
come with that asshole.
I am that asshole.
Did you see the news?
You're fucked.
Did you do that to them?
No, it was you.
Don't you remember?
That knife you took?
It had your prints all over it.
Don't do anything stupid
and get over here.
Be here in an hour or
it's going to the cops.
Where?
Call me when you come to
Hongik Station Entrance #2.
And tell that bitch.
I spent all her money, asshole.
What do we do?
Let's see what she wants.
Let's just call the police.
I'll come with you.
You stay here.
You'll be in my way.
And put this on.
Encore Cosplay Club
They got passports, why the hell
did you put them in containers?
You fucking idiots!
Shut the fuck up!
I'm hanging up, I got a customer!
What do you do here?
Hey! Keep the door locked!
Okay.
Call him. He didn't call yet?
What do you want?
I'm here for her, not you.
Is he...
It's him, how did he know?
I was going to tell you on the phone,
you'll never get your vision back.
Shit...
What are you waiting for?
Are you fucking deaf?
Shut the hell up.
Bring me the knife.
Coming in here won't do you any good.
Do you think you can save her?
What was the friend's name? Hye-joo?
Bring the knife.
Why did you take my
knife in the first place?
Did you kill those kids?
Why would I?
Then it was his fault.
What are you doing?!
The knife.
Don't send her out, just rip her apart.
Bring me the knife.
Fucker.
Bring it.
That's enough!
Don't move.
It's a Filipino replica,
but it'll still put a
hole in your head.
You should call 911 if
you want to save him.
Shoot him already!
Shut the hell up!
Dammit.
Let me go!
Nice body.
Hold still!
What the fuck?
Are you all right?
Do you know where Yoon-ji is?
Where's Yoon-ji?
We figured you out.
I know how you found us.
She's dead if I get hurt!
Should I dig it out? You
won't need it anyways.
Runaways are all the same.
Guys hustle and
girls sell their bodies.
They cover their motel costs. When the girls run
out of money, they come back and do it again.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
If a pervert beats a girl,
the guys enter to save her,
then both get charged for prostitution.
So, they need an agency like us.
We keep them safe systematically.
Why Yoon-ji?
She wasn't a runaway.
She was chosen...
Chosen?
Go find out yourself!
Boss will know something's
wrong by now!
All guys are the same.
Any deeper and your
artery will be severed.
You can imagine what'll happen then.
She's at Don't Tell Papa.
Is that a club?
No, it's a motel.
In Wonju, near Hole in One Golf Course.
Who chose her?
I really don't know,
only the boss knows.
I'm serious.
Mr. Spotty?
When cops come, ask
them to send you to the ER.
Yes, I'm on site.
I'll keep you posted.
I really heard someone fighting.
This place was so suspicious.
Weird people coming by often.
Don't Tell Papa
Damn.
Where's the girl?
First one to talk lives.
Where?
We really don't know!
I swear on my mother's grave,
I only did what I was told!
Don't kill me! Please!
Please!
Fucking let me live!
Let me live, you fucker!
Fine, but if you lie,
I have to go up and
do this all over again.
Thank you, sir!
But I really don't know!
That's the truth!
Fuck, wait, I know who does!
Who?
The manager.
Who's that?
The one with dreadlocks.
But he'll never snitch,
he's a stubborn fucker.
If you let me go, I'll find out!
How?
I know the kindergarten
where his son goes.
Dreadlocks?
You know what?
I'm the only one who
knows where the girl is.
That knife,
Spetsnaz.
Ballistic knife.
It's a great knife.
Where's the girl?
My boss suffered a great
loss because of you.
He'll need more girls,
including the one you're looking for.
If you die, I won't
be able to find her.
Can you survive?
Donghae Port, Cargo Terminal,
Vladivostok Irina.
8 AM.
You better hurry if
you want to find her.
Hands up!
Put your hands up!
Did you kill the girl
from the apartment too?
I got the evidence from
the rink too, asshole.
Let's talk after I find the girl.
What girl?
Don't try to fool me.
You weren't there
when it all went down,
I'm just a witness, not a suspect.
It's against the law to keep a witness
from receiving medical attention
and forcing a confession.
You're a law expert now?
You're a piece of work.
Get in.
Are you really looking for someone?
FREEDOM
IRINA
Hurry up!
You crazy son of a bitch!
What are you doing?
You're fucking nuts!
Sir.
Fuck.
Who chose Yoon-ji?
Fuck you, bitch!
Hey, dirty cop,
your sponsor just died,
and I have proof of your corruption.
What should I do?
I can become your sponsor.
I needed a dirty cop to
clean up my mess anyways.
Okay, I'm off.
I'll be in touch.
Hospital
We have the same agency.
What does that mean?
We have the same clothes.
What day is it?
It's Tuesday.
You were out for 2 days.
Is it raining?
Yeah, it's been raining all day.
Pitter-patter. Pitter-patter.
It sounds good.
Police will come by later.
Tell them everything you know.
Everything?
Yeah.
Everything.
Where are you going?
My room.
Where's your room?
VIP room.
Take me there too.
It's expensive.
You're rich.
And you're not.
You can pay for me.
That's what I'm doing.
You're so annoying sometimes.
You...
as well.
Can you move to this room?
No, I hate cops coming in and out.
I hate...
being alone.
Thank you.
You owe me.
Then you have to see
me until I get a job.
No, just send the money,
I'll give you my bank info.
You're in good shape,
aside from the scratches...
How's the clean up?
It went all right.
Donghae Port went over smoothly
aside from your statement.
So you came for my statement?
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.
We should talk about our agreement.
The dirty cop talk?
How did you know I was with Mr. Spotty?
The body in your trunk.
He didn't want the girl talking
to the cops, so he had her killed.
And you came to take the body
away from the apartment.
Are you there?
Yes, I'm on site.
Why would he take
the body to the motel?
The incinerator behind the motel
isn't for just burning garbage.
It's used to burn evidence.
Don't beat yourself up.
We can come to an agreement.
How much do you want?
How much can you afford?
As much as you want.
But there's one more
thing you need to do.
What?
I need to know who wanted Yoon-ji.
He and I weren't exactly BFFs
who disclosed such secrets.
I can give you a lot of money.
He's connected to the Russian mafia.
It's out of my hands.
Our deal extends to finding
out who chose Yoon-ji.
Remember that.
Damn, I can't hit for shit.
Oh my, haven't seen you in a while.
You want to try some new models?
Glock?
Have you ever shot an H&K?
Let's have a bet.
I came to ask for a favor.
Favor?
You've never even asked
for a soda in 6 years,
I'm afraid of what you'll ask.
What's with the suspense?
I need some guns, untraceable.
What do you need it for?
Don't ask.
I'll give you more than market price.
Ever seen the movie
'The Man from Nowhere'?
The one with Won Bin.
A friend of the guy
asking for guns tells him,
"Don't do whatever
you're thinking of doing".
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I know an American
soldier heading back soon.
I can introduce you.
Makes no difference
if you get it yourself.
But I'll feel better.
And I have to take a
cut as a middle man.
What model?
M200 sniper.
Silencer for it too.
For real?
How soon can you get it?
What's really going on?
You know...
the weather is so gloomy.
How's it going?
One more week, huh? Are you having fun?
Yeah, sweetie, I hit
the club yesterday.
Guys were all over me,
I was so tired.
You went to a country club?
No, a club, a dance club.
Club?
Why would they let you in?
You're so full of it.
I'm still smoking hot.
How's the kid?
Yoon-ji?
She's good.
Something's fishy.
What is?
Well, you always
call my friends' kids...
Punk Kid 1, Punk Kid 2, and such...
But you call Yoon-ji by her name.
You're right.
Anyways, take care of yourself.
Got it?
You too, honey.
Be careful.
Was that your wife?
Yeah.
Should I guess what you're thinking?
What am I thinking?
Whether I can discharge
in a week or not.
I bet you're scared of her the most.
I am scared
of losing her.
You better get well and be out of here.
The longer you stay, the
more debt you'll have.
I'll pay you back.
You're so cheap for a rich guy.
If you get out in a week, I
won't charge you interest.
You were you going
to charge me interest?
Yeah, 24%, maximum legal amount.
You're no fun.
You must be all better
to talk back like that.
Eat up, it's expensive.
Did you find out?
Money truly is king.
You can get whatever
information you want.
Get to the point.
The request came in through
the Russian mafia.
It was the Russians who wanted Yoon-ji?
Not sure about that,
but once she's in Vladivostok,
she was to be sent
to a hotel room under the
name Park Hyung-joo.
Park Hyung-joo?
This is classified intel
from an Interpol friend.
Send me a picture of Park Hyung-joo.
This piece of shit dirty cop
doesn't pick up when I need him!
Hey, are you going to the bank?
Take the ledger first!
Fuck!
Park Hyung-joo.
Who asked for Yoon-ji?
Whose day did I ruin?
Take it.
Put it on speaker.
Mama Pig
Pick up faster!
You'll get a text, I'm sorry.
What's wrong with your voice?
I'm a bit under the weather...
Are the girls ready
for the old fart's party?
Check on "crème de la crème".
You'll get a text, no mistakes.
Shit!
Who's the old fart?
You'll kill me, won't you?
Fuck, you won't let me live
after what you've done here!
- It all depends on you.
- Shut your face, asshole!
Don't give up hope,
you might just live.
I just know he's a judge.
I worked 10 years for him and
haven't seen his face once!
KH, Gapyeong, 25
What does it mean?
Korean high school.
Korean national teenagers.
Rest are locations and dates.
Go on.
The Ant Museum in Gapyeong.
The resort is beside it, you'll see it.
You don't look like a civilian,
but these guys are on another level.
How do you find girls?
Here and there, Yang and me!
We hand them over to Mama Pig,
then she dresses them
up to the judge's taste.
He's not satisfied with
Korean girls nowadays,
so he gets girls from
the Russian mafia.
Russian mafia?
Not the real mafia.
They run a hotel in Sakhalin
and trade girls out of there,
and expanded to Vladivostok.
The judge hired his
bodyguard from there.
They take Korean girls
to Russia for sex trade,
then get rid of them
once they're all used up?
Koreans are popular these days.
It's a fucking cultural exchange!
Koreans to Russia, Russians
to Southeast Asia.
Southeast Asians are traded to Korea.
Shit, I'm the CEO of an
entertainment company!
Our clients have a
wide variety of tastes,
and not enough supply.
JH, CH, AH, shit.
I can get them all for you, deal?
Yeah.
Look who it is.
Little bird told me
you retired, is it true?
Ocean
Put your hood on.
Screw you.
I'm the one who heard
about your retirement,
you have a condition,
pal, go see a shrink.
I had a good reason.
A major clean up will
be needed in Gapyeong.
Do that one last job for me.
I only do special cleanings these days.
My specialty is suicide clean
up with legitimate bodies.
Let me be a good father to my kids.
Nowadays, a rich
father is a good father.
I'll pay you double.
It's not about the money.
Triple.
Quadruple?
I'll give you a shout soon.
Hurry up over there, get a move on!
Closed shop today?
Yeah, of course.
I don't want to advertise
that I'm selling guns here.
Got the stuff?
You have to thank me.
You know I never
touch this stuff, right?
Is this it?
Can't take this back.
The soldier who got me
this flew out this morning.
No refunds either.
What if something is wrong with it?
You know how it is.
You want a receipt with that too?
You want to take it in for
service if it doesn't work?
Anyways, is this the model I asked for?
I have no idea.
What if I unbox it and find a brick?
How long have you been
dealing with me, don't be absurd!
You said you've never done this.
I haven't, for fuck's sake.
At least it's not a brick.
I thought he sent a tank or something.
Hold on a sec.
Didn't you say you were
an armorer for 30 years?
I'm just making sure, that's all.
What is it?
Where are you?
How are you feeling?
I can get out in a few days.
I stopped the interest.
It's good to be young,
why are you calling?
Just because.
Just because why?
Hye-joo's mom came by today.
Did she say something to you?
Hye-joo committed suicide,
and she blamed me.
When are you coming?
In the evening.
Can you come sooner?
Okay.
Police Department
Hey, dirty cop.
Didn't I tell you to call
from a burner phone?
Then you should have picked up.
It's not like I jerk around.
Yoon-ji's mom isn't
her biological mother.
Her dad passed 3 years ago,
and she's with her stepmom now.
And the judge you asked about
is the Chief Justice of
the Central District Court.
Family wealth is considerable,
and has strong political influence.
Why the hell did you want me
to look into such a big fish?
Do me a favor.
Alex!
Boris!
Come in!
Come in!
Drop your weapon.
Put the gun down, bastard.
Is the situation under
control, Detective Lee?
Yes, it's done.
This guy is the real deal.
Look at that knife.
Where did he get the gun?
Is it you?
Did you pick Yoon-ji?
I'm Kim Jung-hoon.
Detective Lee tells me
you're a famous mercenary.
What?
Either a rich mercenary,
or a rich judge with power.
No contest.
You're one of a kind.
Detective Lee, take care of him.
Don't worry, sir.
I'll make it look like a suicide.
Give me his gun.
Let's go.
He's so scary, right?
I'll comfort you.
You know I have evidence
of your corruption, right?
That perverted judge will bail me out.
This is where power comes in handy.
All good things must be shared.
Wait, wait.
Why did I let you catch
me? To get to the judge.
Wait, wait!
Put something on.
No need to look around.
No one is coming to save you.
I'm the next Supreme Court Justice.
A favor from someone
like me is worth a lot.
Perhaps.
One call from me,
you're safe from everything
that's happened.
And everything that will happen.
And Mama Pig?
Right, Mama Pig.
That girl's mom is in the middle of it.
She used to deal with the upper class,
but she got caught for prostituting
minors and offered Yoon-ji to me first.
So she's the worse one,
she's a real bitch!
Let's blame it all on
her and Detective Lee,
and call it a day.
How about it?
And you keep doing what you do?
Thanks to you, my connections
to the girls went poof.
I can't do it anymore.
I'll just watch some porn.
Anyways, who manages this place?
Mama Pig.
We can just blame everything on her.
Then she can clean this up.
Clean what up?
This.
- Incredible.
- It's true.
I'm going to go to the washroom.
Okay, I'll be on the beach.
All right.
Judge Kim
Hey baby, sorry about that.
Things got messed up this time.
I'll send you another ripe...
Your baby's not there.
How much do you know about me?
I get sensitive when
my wife is involved.
Take it easy.
Why did you get close to my wife?
I heard her husband
owned a few buildings.
Is that why you used your daughter?
For money?
Which men don't like young girls?
Let's go.
Stop here.
I'll take care of her
until she's an adult.
Was that the reason?
All men are the fucking same!

I kept my promise.
