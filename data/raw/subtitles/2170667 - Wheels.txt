I always wondered
what death was like.
My name is Mickey.
And this is my story.
The reoccurring dream,
The dream that you hate,
because it was just a dream.
When I was a child, I didn't
have a care in the world.
I remember being truly happy,
from head to toe.
My older brother Jimmy
was my best friend.
We did everything together.
My father Allen was
a police officer.
I thought he was the
toughest man on the planet.
He owned the most beautiful
car in the world.
A 1969 cherry red Buick
Skylark convertible.
He promised me that one day,
that car would be mine.
Time to
take your medicine.
My mom, Karen, had a smile
that could cure anything.
I'll never forget her hands.
She had the most elegant hands.
Every day before dinner should would
give me and my brother piano lessons.
On Sunday's we would go to
the Arcade on the Pier.
Me and my brother, Jimmy,
we were Ski-ball champions.
Go! Go! Hurry!
I had the perfect family.
Thank you sir,
Thank you so much. Have you
tried the cheese pizza here?
It's delicious.
Hello?
Hello?
Mickey?
Mickey.
Don't lie to me Karen! What the
hell you doing around the house,
all day long while I'm out there
putting my ass on the line!
You're being paranoid!
Paranoid of what?
She's gone, honey.
She took your brother.
Rescue 911.
Hi, this is an emergency.
What is
your emergency, sir?
Yeah, I heard some screams
coming from 317 Bentley Avenue.
Sir, we have that listed as
the location that you're calling from.
Yeah, well I know that is
where I'm calling from.
Okay.
Look, I'm gonna slit my wrists.
So can you be here in, I don't
know, approximately 30 minutes?
Sir, I don't know
what's going on.
But slitting your
wrists is not the answer.
Well that's-that's,
uh-peachy.
Okay. Sir.
Alright, have a nice day.
Sir, I need you to
stay on the line with...
Now look Mickey,
Some people feel like they have
no control over their lives,
When they actually have
control over everything.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Trust me, I have.
But you gotta learn how to pick
yourself up off the ground.
Keep going.
I know what you've been through can
have a crippling effect on a man.
I want you to know that you can
always come back to the center.
The door is always open.
Alright, here you go.
Take care of yourself, Mickey.
What a crock of shit.
Hey! Stop!
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Holly shit!!
Oh my god!
Someone call 911!
After all of the times I
had tried to end my life,
I had finally realized
that I needed help.
I couldn't do it alone.
I needed to find someone who
would do anything for money.
Someone who didn't care
about anything anymore.
And that's when I met...
Drake.
Ahhhh!!!
Fucking help me!
Please, I need money for
my medicine. Please!
- Help! Please help me!
- Hang on. Here.
I'm fucking dying here! I need
some money for my medicine, man!
Here's twenty bucks.
Here's twenty bucks.
Jesus. Here, let me help you up.
Gett your fucking hands off of me!
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- Fucking asshole!
- What's wrong with me?
Fuck you! Mother fucker!
You fucking son of
a fucking bitch!
Fucking asshole.
Let me get a beer.
Let's play a little man
pool. Huh? A little money game.
Ten bucks.
Ten bucks? What
is this, high school?
I'll take the first ten and then
we'll do another ten
and so on and so forth
until you're fucking broke.
Get a partner.
Hey numb legs, you
wanna play some pool?
Let's go. Let's do it.
Come on.
I'd love to.
Alright! It's the cripples
versus the big, bad, bikers.
Hey, uh, I need you to, uh,
I need you to shoot me.
Yeah, yeah. You
can break. Here.
Get your money down!
Roller Derby in town.
Get that money on the table.
Stop squawking.
Come on. Let's play.
I almost forgot. I saw
a sweet looking 1200
outside. Gotta be one of yours.
Whose bike?
That's my bike.
That's your bike? Man.
Who the fuck colors
their bike that way?
You god damn must be some
kind of faggot. You a faggot?
What? Have you lost
your mother fucking mind?
You're a faggot mother fucker!
Nice shot cripple.
Who the fuck you calling
cripple mother fucker!
Fucking God damn!
Fuck you! Yeah! Get him!
Hey! Get off him!
Fuck you mother fucker!
Take that you fat mother fucker.
Get off Chino's table.
Get the fuck off Chino's
table! God damn it!
You do not get
on his fucking table!
That was fucking great!
Yeah. You got a bad cut on your face.
You should get that looked at.
Ah, shit happens.
Hey, I'll give you five hundred
dollars if you shoot me.
Where's the gun?
Where do you want it?
I want you to shoot
me in the head.
Shit.
You really want me to kill you?
Yeah, man. What did
you think I meant?
I thought maybe wound you.
Come on, man.
Will you help me out?
Okay.
What's your name?
Mickey.
Okay, Mick. My name is Drake.
What are you doing?
I am going to shoot you in the
face, What do you think I'm doing?
No, No. I don't want my face to get messed
up. Shoot me in the back of the head.
Your face is gonna explode if I
shoot you in the back of the head.
No, it won't.
Look, the bullet enters the back of the
head clean, whent comes out the front
your head explodes, and huge chunks
of brain and skull come flying out.
Okay, look.
I just don't want to see it coming. Ok.
So just shoot men the back of the head.
Okay.
Here we go.
Wait a second.
Where's the money?
Just shoot me, then
take the money and go.
No. I need to see the money.
You might not even have it!
Or you do have it and
then I shoot you and then what?
I am searching through your
brains and skull for the money,
and then I find it
and it's soaked in blood!
I'm not gonna just give
you the money, and then
you wound me in the leg
and just take off!
What the fuck good would it do
if I wounded you in the leg?
My arm, my leg, whatever.
What's stopping me from taking
your God damn money right now?
Okay. Alright.
Look. I have the money.
I'll hold it in my hand.
You shoot me, the money
falls our of my hand, and
then you just pick it up.
And then you just take off.
Okay. I like that. Okay.
- Do you want to pray or something?
- No...
Ah! It burns!
What the fuck just happened?
I don't know, just
finish me off.
Stop it. Something's wrong, stop
it. Something's wrong! Stop it!
These are fucking
blanks, man. You idiot!
Give me my money!
Screw you, buddy!
Seriously dickhead! There's
blanks in that gun!
I know that!
What are we gonna do now, huh?
You owe me at least 100 bucks
for the attempted execution.
There's no execution,
there's no money.
I went through the same premeditation
as if I had killed you.
You didn't even stop and think!
There was a hesitation.
I tell you what. I'm sorry
you're not dead, okay?
I'll tell you something else,
I'm a make this up to you.
I know this great place with
these En Vogue prostitutes.
I don't want prostitutes.
They have HIV clusters.
30 seconds ago you were gonna have me
shoot you in theack of the fucking head.
Where is this place?
So you're telling me, you've
never been with a prostitute?
Yeah, that's a no.
These are En Vogue prostitutes.
Amazing.
Want to hit this?
No, thanks. I'm good.
Maybe it's past your bedtime.
You better get home.
Alright. Give me some of that.
Thanks for jumping
in back there.
Yeah, you got it.
So how'd you end
up in the chair?
I was putting up
Christmas lights.
Easy, easy, easy.
My legs. Dad. My Legs.
It's okay, don't move.
You fell off a roof?
Yeah.
Fuck. I'm sorry, man.
It's okay. What about you?
What happened to you?
Oh my!
Oh my God, you are
feeling the Drake!
God damn it!
Oh shit!
Son of a bitch.
Fucking bitch.
Fortunately, the guy missed my
nuts and only hit me in the spine.
Did your dick get all fucked up?
No! Fuck no!
I just said I didn't
get hit there.
I can still fuck
with the best of em!
So what do I do? I just
hand them the money, or...
- Yeah, you just...
- Hello?
Hey! It's your favorite vet.
Come on in, soldier.
Showtime, Mick.
So yeah, you just
hand them the money.
Oh! And they think I was
shot saving some guy.
Should I make something up?
Yeah, if you want to.
Like I was a police officer
and I was shot, or something?
No, no. That's too common,
it's been done before.
Think of something more
original.
So how do I look?
- Good.
- Huh? Yeah?
Hello, hero.
Hey, hey, hey gorgeous.
So, who's the cutie?
He's a friend of mine. Yeah,
he's an ex stunt man.
Well, nice to meet
you, Hollywood.
It's nice to meet you.
You must be here
for my roommate.
Hold on a second.
Oh, man. You are
going to love this.
What the fuck am I
supposed to do?
I'm still wearing my catheter,
and I think it's full.
Good luck.
She'll be ready in a minute.
You ready, baby?
Oh yeah!
Go get 'em champ!
Hi.
Don't turn around.
What's your name?
My name is Mickey.
Well, Mickey, I...
Oh my God, what
happened to your face?
Here. Get on the bed, we'll
get you cleaned up.
You know, I've had
plenty of wounds.
Yeah.
I was a stunt man.
That's fancy.
I am gonna put this on your chin, it's
probably gonna sting a little bit.
I'm sorry, did that hurt?
No, it felt good.
You're funny.
Let me get you bandaged up.
You should be as good as new.
Cuite Pie.
Yeah, well. It's $100 an hour.
Okay.
No problemo.
You want some coke?
No, thank you. I'm not thirsty.
Never heard that one before.
Okay.
Yeah?
Okay, great. Here you go.
Just inhale as
deeply as you can.
Very good job.
I gotta win this game, right?
So I wind back, I cock back,
like a shotgun and I just
explode these pool balls, and
they go all over the place.
These guys are
big. They're big.
Are you gonna do that line?
Or...
I take a look at them, dead
square in the face and I said-
Fuck you, pal.
Once you take Mickey
out of the cage,
he's tough to get back in.
I'm finished, let's go!
Fuck you! You fucking
dick-less prick!
You're being
a fucking bitch!
I'll see you around?
Let's go!
What's your name?
Janet.
Alright look.
Mick, I'm not gonna fuck
with you on this one, okay?
Here's the deal.
You stay calm.
You don't look him in the eye.
And most importantly, you don't say
anything stupid, and we will be fine.
What would I say that's stupid?
Alright, what you're saying
right now, is stupid.
This guy will end us, in
two fucking seconds, okay,
if you make a Faggedy
Andy comment like that.
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.
Just keep your mouth shut. Alright,
And let me do the talking.
Now, give me the money.
What for?
Mick, weren't you
paying attention?
Yeah, I was paying attention.
Okay, if you were paying
such close attention.
- What do we need the money for?
- You need it for drugs.
Ding! Ding! Ding! Mickey's
the big fucking winner!
And what has he won, Drake?
Oh! An all expenses paid
trip to Heroine Land! The
most happiest place on Earth!
I don't want to do any Heroine.
We're doing speed balls.
What's a speed ball?
Coke and Heroine.
The best there is.
Look, it's not all for us.
200 for the smack,
150 for the coke. Keeps
the girls happy.
It's gonna keep the girls happy?
You want Janet to
like you, right?
Yeah.
Ok. Look. We buy the stuff, we both try it.
And then we party with the girls,
and then later on tonight,
I'll go home and get a bullet
I'll off you myself personally.
For free this time.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
Let's do this.
Alright, give me the money
before he gets here.
Just give me the fucking money.
Who's the new guy?
Well, I wanted you to meet
colleague of mine. This is Mickey.
Right.
No, not you. I don't know you.
You want a doughnut? We
got sprinkles, chocolate.
You must be outta your fucking
mind bringing someone to my house.
Nah man, he's cool.
You know I miss when you
used to wear a suit.
What do we got here?
350 cash.
Interesting.
Elvis] That and no bundle right?
Both.
We've already been through
this, you can't have both.
Both.
Ah!!
You can't have both.
You can have your bundle.
Or you can have that.
Let her go.
Come on in.
Hey, I have a gift for
you. Brand new rig.
So you live here?
Fuck no, man. I have house
in the hills with a pool,
view of the city.
I just use this as my station.
Shit, go ahead. It's little
primer, little primer.
Yes, come on lil'
precious, come out.
You have a pet rabbit.
Aw yeah, this is Maritza,
let's meet Mickey
Rabbits are fucking cool.
Fuck yeah they are.
Ya know, if anyone ever
hurt this little baby,
I'd take this knife and
cut out their eyes.
Isn't that right my little baby?
Yes I would, I'd fucking kill 'em.
Feel that?
Huh, sweet.
Alright Mick, time to
get your sea legs.
How can I explain it?
When you're at the bottom,
you can only go up.
I have been looking for a
reason to kill myself.
And as twisted, and as
messed up as it sounds,
now I've finally found
a reason to live.
If I could compare
heroin to anything,
I would compare it
to being able to walk again.
Mickey?
Wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up.
What!?
Now can I get some
sleep, dickhead?
Fuck!
Fuck you.
I'll fuck you up.
You get some fucking sleep
dickhead.
What the fuck are you doing? I'm gonna
burn you alive! Fucking "A" motherfucker!
You limp dick mother fucker. Ah!
Motherfucker! Fucking asshole!
- Fuck!
- Fuck you!
You fucking piece of shit!
You fucking cocksucker!
Alright, alright, alright!
E-fucking-nough man!
The fucks wrong with you?
Where's the gear?
It's in the pack.
You're fucking psychotic Mick.
I'm tired of this
small time shit.
We need to hookup with
Elvis' connection.
Do we have anymore gear?
Done Dada.
Oh, you're sick man.
Elvis will hook us up.
We give him the cash
and don't fuck it up-
Fuck!
How the fuck do you
expect me to eat now?!
Alright, come on Mick.
Let's get you to the bathroom.
It's okay. It's okay.
I thought you said
that you were out?
I always have a little
for a rainy day.
And it's fucking raining.
I'm gonna take care
of you lil' Mick.
Hey, you hear me?
Let's go.
More.
Alright, it's your funeral man.
That's good. That's fucking
good, right there.
I love you so much, Mickey.
That's why I'm gonna
tell you the truth.
I hate to tell you this.
But I know you can handle it.
You're growing up into a fine
young gentleman and you're ready.
You remember,
that piano set you wanted?
The one with the little keys
and the tambourine thing and
you hit it with your feet and
it went ding! Remember that?
It was the last present Santa
brought to a child in the world.
He was coming down the chimney
with that piano set and that piano set
made a lot of noise, it woke me up.
You remember,
the shotgun daddy keeps
under his bed for burglars?
Yeah, you remember.
He came down that chimney,
and I shot him.
In his fat pudgy face,
and killed him.
Santa's dead little Mickey.
I shot Santa and
buried his carcass,
in the backyard
under your rope swing.
I feel just terrible about that.
But if you hadn't
wanted that piano set,
Santa wouldn't be dead...
would he?
Whoa,
had a good one there.
Passed out for a second.
Come on, let's get you
to the girls place.
I'm gonna go hit up Elvis.
Let's go.
Okay, well, these
need to be cleaned.
Oh, you have another pair that
you left here the other week.
I washed them for you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you want some
company for bath time?
I don't think
that's a good idea.
I have to wash my hair anyway.
It's just, you know, I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just think, you
know we should,
we should give it
a try sometime.
What? Wash your hair?
- Hey!
- Oh!
I'm in my clothes.
Yeah, we'll save you some
on the laundry bill.
Whoa!
Oh no!
Oh no!
He broke my fucking
hand, where's Mick?
I've been wheeling around
for hours in circles, man.
Elvis broke my fucking
hand, that motherfucker!
He wouldn't even give it to me.
You didn't get the shit?
I got the fucking shit.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
- Okay, so I burst in...
- Right.
And I look him dead in the
eyes and I said, Elvis,
I want your fucking connection.
Right now. And bang!
Gave me that connection.
Guess where the hookup is?
Mexico!
We'll get like a little
hacienda in Mexico.
With a farm and lots of cocaine.
We have to get the cash first.
How are we gonna get the cash?
Do you not fucking listen?
See, I say something
and you're fucking
fourteen steps ahead.
There's like thousands, of millions
of hundreds, of ways to make money.
Parking lots!
There's a lot of money in parking lots.
We take my blank gun and we-
Fucking brilliant!
Can I finish my fucking plan!?
This one guy I know, I
knew this one guy right,
he was in the hospital
when I was in there,
And his arm got stuck
in the thing and it got
ripped right the fuck off
man, I'm telling you,
it's dangerous, you can make a
lot of money. Lot of money.
That's the stupidest fucking thing
I've ever heard in my life, man.
I just want gold. Can I have
like, gold faucets, and-
We're gonna have so much stuff,
it's going to be like a bakery.
Only instead of flour, yak!
I want piles of cocaine, and
then surrounded by gold.
I'm gonna buy Maritza
a gold fucking cage.
We're going to Mexico, man.
He hasn't given me the
exact fucking address, but
we're going to Mexico. I
know it's in Mexico. Fuck!
What?
Do they have
addresses in Mexico?
So I think I should
hold onto the money.
You are not good with money.
I'm great with money, what
are you talking about?
I'm the best one with money.
You're fucking good
at spending money.
We fuck this up we're dead, I
told you motherfuckers that.
Dude, there is a lot of
uselessness with this attitude.
Do you know how much coke you
do when you're dead, none!
We go to like one of these
water parks, right.
And we have them fucking
load us up at the top.
And it dumps us down the slide
and we get to the bottom
and we're like fuck man your
slide paralyzed me and shit
The lifeguard comes and
boom water park money.
A fucking lawsuit, are
you fucking stupid?
You know how long it takes to
fucking get money from a lawsuit?
At least I'm coming
up with ideas.
You're not coming up with ideas,
you're coming up with bullshit.
You take my blank gun
from my backpack, right.
You getting shot is
not a good idea, man.
We just team 'em up man.
Fucking just rack 'em.
Pande-fucking-monium!
And then we score Rolexes and
cash and like fucking wallets.
That's the way we're gonna
make the money, right there.
We are gonna need a fucking dump truck
for all the money we're gonna make.
Get out of the
fucking car bitch!
Where do you think
you're fucking going?!
What?
What the fuck are you doing?
Shit! I told you to wait until
opens the fucking cash register!
Take this. Take it!
I got it!
Give me some money!
Come on Mick, hurry the fuck up!
Alright, that's about it.
You got the cash right?
Yeah, Maritza's watching
over everything.
By sundown tomorrow, we will be back
and it's gold fucking cage time.
Hey, cowboy!
I made you lunch.
Come on Janet.
Choppity, chop, chop.
Come on tough guy.
I'm trying.
Mickey get in the tub.
I don't want to get in the tub.
Get in the tub.
But Mommy, he's wearing clothes.
He's gonna be fine.
We're all gonna
take a bath today.
- Mickey.
- Mickey! Wake up.
Are we there yet?
No, we're getting gas. You should
probably handle your business.
All yours, Mick.
Hey, Maritza!
Maritza, come here.
Maritza, come here.
Goddammit.
Hey Lisa, help me with Maritza.
Get your own fucking rabbit.
Maritza baby. Maritza.
Oh, here let me
help you with that.
I can... I can get it.
Dammit.
It's not like you're going
to mess this place up.
Not very sexy, is it?
Why are you so good to me?
I'm not that good to you.
You should really
give this shit up.
What are you, my mom?
Don't. Don't do that.
What's wrong?
Listen to me for a second, okay?
Lisa and I were out,
and we met Drake and
he wanted to pay Lisa
to have sex with him.
And he can't have sex.
But he kept coming,
and kept paying.
I asked Drake, I said you know
you have any paraplegic friends,
have them come over.
I would never have
sex for money.
I'm not a whore.
So this is about money?
No.
No.
Is it because I'm crippled?
Look, at first is was about
money, but things changed.
Please forgive me.
Thanks loser, ha!
Hey. Hey!
Don't you dare! Hey!
Get the fuck back here!
You fucking bitches!
Hey! Hey!
Fuck you! Get back here!
Fuck! Fuck, Mick! Where
the fuck were you?!
Motherfucker!
They got
all our fucking money!
God Damn it!
Where were you?
What were you doing?
Fuck man!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Elvis is gonna fucking kill us.
Fucked up his connection.
Those fucking cunts.
I can't take it anymore, Mick.
I mean what's the fucking point.
I'm gonna tell you something that
don't tell you in the story books.
Everybody knows this rule, but
nobody will talk about it.
Some people are born
to do great things.
Some people are born
to walk on the moon.
Or to become president.
Everyone else,
No matter how hard they try,
The world will not
let them ever, ever,
have their dream.
You only have one choice, Mick.
The choice to die.
And you had it right the
first time I met you.
Just speeding up the
process is all.
You get everything you
wanted for Christmas?
I miss Mommy.
I know.
Hey, buddy.
It's from your mom.
It's from Mommy!
It's better to look
at the card first.
Dear Mickey.
Use this brick when you
build your first house.
Love Mom.
Why did Mommy give me a
brick for Christmas?
You girls are fucking dead.
What the fuck?
Lisa! You twat!
My leg!
Fuck!
Are you okay?
I ran over your leg?
What are you doing
under my car man?
We're gonna get you
to a hospital okay?
Fuck your hospital!
That's right
motherfucker.
Where's the fucking money?
- I've got my wallet in the car.
- Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Want me to get it?
Fucking go get the wallet.
Go get the wallet.
Keys.
Give him the keys.
I'll take the fucking
keys you asshole.
- Move slowly.
- Track him.
I'm fucking tracking him.
No you're not, you've got to
get around and follow him.
I fucking tracking him,
stop yelling at me!
I can fucking see where
he's coming from, alright?
Just go around the
fucking truck!
I can fucking see him. I'm up
ere, you're down there! Alright?
My peripheral I can see him.
You can't see him over
the fucking truck man!
- You can't see.
- You want my wallet?
Yes. Toss me the wallet.
Shut up! Toss me the wallet.
What do we got, Mick?
Drake, Drake, we've
got some good money.
Mickey!
Mickey!
You motherfucker!
Fuck you!
Mickey?
Mickey?
Mickey? Oh fuck!
I'm sorry.
Mick. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry buddy.
Oh fuck. I'm sorry.
We need a place to sleep, man.
- Those fucking whores, man.
- Where are we gonna sleep?
Those fucking cunts man,
I trusted that bitch.
The fuck was I thinking?
We need a hit.
Fuck!
You know what I'm saying?
We need a hit Drake.
That doesn't fucking
matter anymore, Mick.
It just doesn't fucking matter.
I don't want to get sick.
Why don't you shut the fuck up? You get
sick even when we do have the shit!
Drake, we need to keep it
together bro. We need to...
Hey! Keep your fucking
hands off me.
Don't fucking touch me!
You're a fucking punk man.
You're a fucking punk.
You're the fucking punk.
What? Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Hey, you want a piece
of me, motherfucker?
Come on you crippled fuck.
Fuck you say to me?
Something I've been needing to
ell you for a long time, Mickey.
They didn't leave son.
I don't wanna hear it.
I don't know what you're
trying to tell me. I mean...
I need to tell you the truth.
Stop it. Stop it!
You made them leave!
Stop it!
Drake!
Drake!
Drake!
Drake!
Drake!
Go the fuck back!
Drake.
Let's go back, come on.
Hey. Let the fuck go of me!
Fuck!
- Let's go back!
- I said, let the fuck go of me!
We're gonna fucking
die out here.
Don't you get it?
I really miss her.
I love her so much.
We'll find her buddy.
I'm not talking about Lisa.
You know, before,
before I was paralyzed.
I used to own this
old model spider.
Thing was a cherry.
I used to drive it
down the coast.
I remember...
that smile. Ah.
That beautiful smile.
I killed her, Mick.
I fucking killed her.
I was drunk driving
and I hit a car.
I killed my wife.
God she was beautiful.
That's why I can't walk.
She died.
And I'm paralyzed as punishment.
The worst part of it was,
She was pregnant.
Pregnant.
With my daughter.
My beautiful daughter,
Maritza.
I killed my wife and baby, Mick.
Drake.
Let's go home.
Let's go home.
I'm gonna stay out
here for awhile.
I deserve to die for what I did.
Look, I ain't had a best friend
until you.
You ain't dying on me.
You got that?
I won't let you.
Look how far out we are, Mick.
We can't make it back.
Come on. We're going back,
buddy.
I'm taking you back.
I'm taking you back.
I'm taking you back.
Give me your hand, Mick.
How come you need to
make it so bad? Huh?
Mr. Suicide. Fuck.
I didn't fall off
of a roof, Drake.
My dad pushed me off.
I wanna kill him, Drake.
I can't do it alone.
Okay. Then I need you to
do something for me.
I need to get something back.
And then I want to
come back here...
And you let me die in peace.
Okay?
Okay?
We'll come out here,
and we'll do it together.
Promise me.
I swear.
Okay.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!
I'll fucking blow it up!
I'm gonna burn the fucker!
Hurry up!
Help!
Someone!
Why are you stealing my car?
Because God hates you.
Help me please! Someone!
Open the trunk.
Please!
The fuck are you doing?
I've never driven before.
Please sir.
Get in the fucking car.
You've got to start planning
this shit better, man.
Please God, help me!
I'm in. Let's get the fuck
out of here!
Get up here and work the pedals!
You go fucking work the pedals!
We don't have time
for this shit!
Please don't
take my car.
What's going on with
this crazy bitch?
You look like you love god.
Please don't take my car!
It's just water!
You dumb bitch!
Where the fuck am I?
Doctors said he drank some
paint thinner, window cleaner.
Why would he drink
these things?
I don't know, Bill.
He had some bruises on his left clavic.
Did you two have a fight this morning?
My son almost died, you think I
had something to do with this?
- I would never!
- Take it easy.
Do you know what this is like?
Maybe we should just finish it down
at the station. Is that better?
I'm not leaving my boy.
Let's go.
I don't wanna leave
my boy.
- Al. Let's go.
- Get back!
Take him down.
I don't want to leave Mickey!
You have the right
to remain silent.
Any thing you say, can and will be
used against you, in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can not afford...
Wake up.
Are we there?
This it?
This is it.
Just wait, hold on a second.
What are you doing?
Put the fucking brick away.
- What do you mean wait?
- Wait.
Wait for what?
Just put it away for a second.
What are we here for?
You said let's do this.
- Wait.
- This is the spot.
- Will you just fucking wait.
- We get in, we don't know...
Wait.
Mickey?
I've missed you so much.
This is my friend.
Drake.
It's good to meet you, Drake.
What?
It's good to meet you.
Why don't you boys come in?
I just put some coffee on.
Are you fucking kidding
me with this guy?
Let's get him now.
Get him, Mick.
Let's go.
Put the brick away.
Fucks wrong with you, man?
Mickey?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Fuck.
Mick. Hey Mick.
Mick!
We gonna fucking do
this shit or what?
Yeah, I will just give
me a second, okay?
Alright, well my bag is full.
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
Where the fuck do I go?
It's down the hall on the right.
Remember to sit up
straight, Mickey.
You remember that
song I taught you.
Mom taught that to me.
Lots of cream, lots of sugar.
I see you still have that
brick I gave you?
Mom gave that to me.
No.
It was supposed to
be a gift for her.
A commitment to the
new house we were
gonna build together.
I had the perfect family.
Two trouble making boys,
a beautiful wife.
All I have left of
that now is you.
And she's still taking
that away from me.
Don't blame her for
what you did to me.
I blame myself.
I was away at work. When I should
have been taking care of my boys.
But I thought if I could
just build her dream house,
your mother would get well.
You boys were my life.
I didn't take care of her,
I didn't take care of you.
You still can't admit it.
I've done everything, Mickey.
The doctors,
have done everything.
There's nothing I can say or do,
that will help you walk again.
You pushed me off
a fucking roof.
No, Mickey.
You used to have,
such a light about you when
you were a little boy.
You could light up a room.
When your mother started
making you sick,
that light went out.
Time to
take your medicine.
My mom, she did
not make me sick.
Yes she did, Mickey.
The doctor said he drank so
paint thinner, window cleaner.
I didn't push you off the roof.
That's a lie.
No it's not.
That's a lie!
That's a lie!
You paralyzed me!
Stop it, Mickey! Stop it!
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay. It's okay.
Oh Mickey. Oh Mickey.
You okay?
Why did she do it?!
What was she thinking?!
She's gone, honey.
She took your brother.
Dad.
Dad.
Dad?
Holy shit, Mick.
You killed him.
Call a doctor!
Can't believe you
fucking killed him.
Rescue 911.
Let's go, Mick.
He promised me one day,
that car would be mine.
We're gonna get shit from Elvis?
If we get high, we're never
gonna go out and do it.
Let's go to the ocean.
I ain't here for no gear.
Here.
It's the last cigarette.
Take it.
I'll be back before
you're done smoking it.
Save it.
We'll share it when we get out.
I'm coming in with you.
Alright, Drake, I'm in!
Let's do this!
Hey, what the fuck?
- Don't yell at me!
- Shut the fuck up!
Keep looking!
Shit! Where is it?!
It's got to be here!
Fuck.
Ah. Fuck!
Mick. Mick.
I got it!
Elvis.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Go!
Go ahead, I'm right
behind you. Go!
I'm right behind you.
Drake.
Drake.
Mickey, run!
Drake! Drake!
Mick, just go!
Drake, come on.
I don't want him
getting both of us. Now go!
Go! Run, Mickey!
Mick, I'll
take care of it.
Come on, I'm not leaving
without you, brotha.
I'm not leaving without you,
brotha. Come on.
Mick, just go Mick.
Please just fucking go.
Elvis!
I'm in here
you motherfucker!
Drake come on.
Ah!
Ah!
Mickey, get in the tub.
I don't want to get in the tub.
Get in the tub.
But Mommy,
he's wearing clothes.
He's gonna be fine.
We're all gonna
take a bath today.
Now Mickey,
we're gonna wash your hair.
You have to hold
your breath, okay?
Okay.
My beautiful boy.
Mom, let him go!
Run Mickey!
Mickey!
Ah!
Ah! This is fucked!
You sick fuck!
The doctors
have done everything.
I know what you've been through can
have a crippling affect on a man.
There's nothing I can say or do,
That'll help you walk again.
So, how'd you
end up in the chair?
You fell off a roof?
I didn't fall off
a roof, Drake.
My dad pushed me off.
I didn't push you off the roof.
That's a lie!
No, it's not.
That's a lie!
You paralyzed me!
They didn't leave son.
Bullshit! You made them leave!
Stop it! Stop it!
She killed your brother.
And then she killed herself.
Mickey?
Mickey? What's wrong, stand up.
I can't hold you up.
Mickey, what's wrong?
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay Mickey. It's okay.
Come on breath.
Some people feel like they
have no control over their lives.
When they actually have
control over everything.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Drake.
Drake. Drake!
No. No. No!
- Drake!
- No!
Mick. Mick. Mick.
Get me out of here Mick. Mick.
Take me, take me to the ocean.
Take me to the ocean, Mick.
Almost there.
This is it.
Come on, brother.
We're almost there.
This is it.
The most beautiful,
thing in the world, isn't it?
The most beautiful place,
right where you wanted to be.
Fact.
Everyone dies.
Everyone that you've ever loved,
or known,
will die.
Your parents,
your friends,
even your children.
I knew that one day,
I would die.
I figure,
why not today?
There's one. Go, go!
Get up for real. Okay. Alright.
And when they find the honey.
So what's death like?
I wouldn't know.
I want to live.
Ah!
Ah!
