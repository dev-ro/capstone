 What's going on?
 Will you press that button!
 I believe it's the electricity.
Where are you going, ...?
- Nowhere. I needed to get out there.
Mr. Header couldn't even keep his hands quiet
with lights on.
You want me to go in? 
He'll think it's you.
That guy looks kind. Come on, ask him.
- Nah. You better do it.
We are all gathering in conference room 2709, 
which has no windows. Having a party there. 
Don't you want to join us?
Tell him what kind of party.
- A Braille-party.
A what?
- Braille, like sense of touch.
Oh. Thanks, but...
 David!
- Oh, please don't.
Who's this?
- Josephson.
C.C. wants to see me up here.
He's apparently struck with yearning.
With all His Eminence's inner light he's 
probably not noticed the power outage.
Wait a second, we could have a drink afterwards.
- No, thank you. I just cancelled an orgy. 
I have to go.
- Without me? Until lights come back 
we are stuck.
For once I'll have a foolproof 
excuse for the wife.
