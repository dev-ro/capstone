[People clapping, cheering]
MOORE: Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I wanted to see if a politician
would accept money from anyone.
You know,
and I mean anyone, all right?
I don't mean,
like, R.J. Reynolds...
which gave a million dollars
to the Republicans...
and a half a million dollars...
to the non-smoking Democrats
this year.
I'm talking about
truly despicable groups.
So I formed four of
those despicable groups myself.
Got a bank to give me
a checking account for each...
with the name of the group
on the check...
and then sent $100 contributions
to each of the candidates.
So Bob Dole received $100...
from the Satan Worshipers
for Dole Club.
[Laughter and applause]
Clinton got $100 from
the Hemp Growers of America.
[Laughter]
Pat Buchanan got $100
from Abortionists for Buchanan.
[Laughter]
And...
Ross Perot got $100 from
the Pedophiles for Free Trade.
[Laughter]
And who do you think
cashed the check first?
[People shouting]
That's right, Pat Buchanan.
[Applause]
And here's
the check right here...
the actual check, with
his endorsement on the back.
[Applause]
Abortionists for Buchanan.
Mr. "Right to Life" himself.
The Clinton-Gore campaign
cashed their check...
from the Hemp Growers
of America. Right here.
The thing looks like
it had been rolled up...
and stashed away
for about who knows how long.
But you know how it is...
when you're receiving
contributions from hemp growers.
And Ross Perot sent us
a lovely form letter...
that obviously was spit
out of some computer...
because it said,
"I'd like to thank you...
"and your fellow pedophiles
for your support."
It's true.
[Laughter and applause]
Oh, we live in sick times.
Sick, sick times.
[Music playing]
[Bell clanging]
MOORE, NARRATING: You know,
I always like to see people...
happy and having a good time.
Take these people,
for instance.
They've been having
a real good time.
Me?
Well, I've been out of work.
So I did what
most people like me do...
when they can't get a job...
I wrote a book!
"Downsize This! Random Threats
from an Unarmed American."
I sold it to Random House.
They asked me
if I wouldn't mind...
going on a little author tour,
say four or five cities.
I said, "Sure. Sounds good."
Especially considering
I had no college education...
and flunked 12th grade English.
I kind of liked the idea of
being part of a go-go economy.
I could see it now...
Pulitzers, Nobels...
and appearances
on "The Jerry Springer Show."
[Audience yelling]
There was one little problem
with my master plan...
that check
I wrote the president.
Seems the White House
didn't like it.
I told them
I was just having some fun.
He is a dangerous person.
MOORE:
Boy, he sure seemed defensive.
Of course, at that time...
none of us knew
that lots of other people...
were writing checks
to the president...
and getting
better perks than me.
When it looked like...
I wasn't going to have
the normal author tour...
I called up a few filmmaking
friends of mine...
Tia, Jim, Brian, and Chris...
and told them
to gather their gear...
and meet me in St. Louis.
JIM: not you, but...
Chris, never throw away
your tickets.
Why don't you do
a special on us?
- On how much you make?
- And how much work we do.
Did you ever
get your union back?
- Sort of.
- Sort of?
We'll tell you the next time,
if we do get a raise, ever.
Yeah. When was the last time
you had a raise?
- '83?
- I don't know.
MOORE: '83?
I don't know
if it was '78 or '82.
The cameraman
wasn't even born in '83.
Oh, my...
This is my seat.
I'll see you, boys.
- Economy was full?
- Yeah. It's all full back there.
I gotta sit up here.
But I'll check in
with you guys, OK?
* Roll along, roll along *
* Roll along, roll along *
* Convoy in the sky *
* Roll along, roll along *
* Roll along, roll along *
* Convoy in the sky *
MOORE: Each day of the tour...
was supposed to be
pretty much the same.
Get up at
4:30 in the morning...
fly to the next city...
and be met by the local
Random House publicist...
who they referred to
as my "media escort."
The escort's job was
to keep me out of trouble...
and report all my activities
back to headquarters.
This escort
from Random House...
she doesn't know anything
about this film.
In fact, nobody at Random House
knows about this film.
They're gonna find out
sometime today...
and they're probably
not going to be very happy.
This is my media escort here
in St. Louis.
- Please introduce yourself.
- I'm Elaine Bly.
And it's about 6:15
in the morning here.
But it's a beautiful day.
We're gonna have a good day.
Let's hope.
Let's get going. [Laughs]
MOORE:
No matter what city I was in...
it was always
the same 20 interviews...
with the same 20 questions.
Look at all this ain'time
you've been giving Whitewater...
and how many millions
has Congress spent...
trying to find out why just
seven people lost their jobs...
in the
White House Travel Office?
And not a dime
has been spent investigating...
what happened to millions
of Americans and their jobs.
Most of this welfare
that we give corporations...
comes in the form of things like
a million dollars to McDonald's
to help them promote
Chicken McNuggets in Singapore.
That's our tax dollars.
Or the Pillsbury Company
gets $11 million...
that goes to
the Pillsbury Doughboy...
to be promoted
in Third World countries.
MOORE:
With my interviews over...
I told the escort
we'd be back in a few hours.
We headed out of the city...
to Centralia, Illinois,
home of the PayDay candy bar.
People have been making
PayDays here for over 60 years.
Back in 1992,
Clinton visited Centralia...
on his first campaign
for president.
My own state is full of places
like Centralia...
places where
there are good people...
who work hard
and play by the rules...
who've been forgotten
in George Bush's America.
I want to tell you something.
It doesn't have to be this way.
We can do better.
It is scandalous
to waste the potential...
of the people of this community
and our country.
[Bell clanging]
MOORE: They used
to say that in Centralia...
every day is payday.
On the day I arrived...
they were told
this would be their last.
MOORE: Who's been here
more than ten years?
You've worked here more...
more than ten...
Who's been here
more than 20 years?
She was here for 50 years.
It will be. Already is.
MAN: Know how we found out
we were losin' our jobs?
The head of
Leaf North America...
sends a videotape
in to all the Leaf plants...
telling 'em how they're gonna
reorganize and stuff.
"Oh, by the way, we're shuttin'
the Centralia plant down."
A videotape.
- "And by the way."
- Yeah.
When was the last time
you had a strike here?
We've never been on strike.
- Never been on strike?
- No!
- Never had a walkout?
- No!
We've never
even had an arbitration.
Do you have any idea...
what kind of profit
you were making here?
MAN:
27 million is what they said.
MOORE: Twenty million here,
just inside this building?
Profit, out of this plant.
And now, now what?
People will go off the deep end
that lose their jobs in America.
It happens all the time.
Suicides will go up,
divorce rates...
people start beatin' their kids
that normally wouldn't.
I mean, damn!
People just lose it when
they don't have an income...
or they have to go from
making $10 an hour...
down to $5.00 an hour.
It's tough!
MOORE: Do you know
what he's talking about?
Yeah?
Are you worried about this?
- Yes!
- I'm a single mother.
I can't buy a house
or anything on $5.00 an hour.
MAN: Tell me something.
I want to know...
what's going to happen to
the United States of America...
when they downsize everything...
and we get down to where
everybody's makin' minimum wage.
Who's gonna buy $30,000 cars?
Who's gonna buy homes?
Who's gonna buy this stuff?
I want to know!
And it's just gonna be
like a snowball effect...
because then the automakers
are gonna be out of work...
the construction people's
gonna be...
Who's got the money to buy it...
if we're all downsized
to $4.75 an hour?
When's it gonna end?
MOORE: The workers told me
that the manager from PayDay...
was still across the street
in the factory...
so I decided
to pay him a visit.
He said he'd talk to you...
without the camera
if you'll talk to him.
All right, I'll come in.
You stay here. OK?
MOORE: What is the message
to the American worker?
That if they come here
and work hard and do well...
and because of their hard work
the company does well...
their reward is unemployment?
MAN: If this place
would've done better...
and would've made more profit...
it would have
had a quicker payback.
You're saying if they had made
a bigger profit here...
the move would've been even
quicker to get out of here?
MAN: You're right.
MOORE: If the workers here
had done a worse job...
If the candy bar
hadn't done as well...
there might still be
a candy bar plant here?
- That's true.
- That's insane.
WOMAN: Centralia, Illinois!
MAN: That's right!
[People chattering]
[Music playing]
PayDay back to Centralia
where it belongs.
PayDay in Centralia.
I want my job back, insurance.
I need it badly.
Everybody else needs it badly.
We all need our paydays.
- We want our jobs back.
- Yep.
We need our jobs back.
WOMAN: The whole town
needs these jobs back.
[Music playing]
[Audience applauds]
Hi.
This is my book.
I take the cover off...
because I can't stand
to look at the photo.
[Laughter]
Look at... look...
Who's got the...
Do you have a book down here?
Let me see it.
Look at this.
This is what they did.
Look at my fingernails.
They digitally gave me
a manicure.
[Laughter]
They cleaned my fingernails.
Can you see... Look at that!
And I called them up
at Random House, and I said...
"You know, I mean,
while you were in there...
"if you were gonna be
doing digital things...
"couldn't you take
10 pounds off the face?"
"Oh, no, no, no.
We'll clean your fingernails.
"But then you gotta
still look like this."
[Laughter]
Jeez. Nineteen cities.
I can't bear to look at myself,
thank you, anymore.
Signature only.
Signature, city and date.
"To Meredith,"
signature, city and date.
City and date.
"To Pat and Teresa."
[Woman laughing]
- How's that?
- That's great. Thank you.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Anything else?
Sounds like the next title.
- You'll be there a day ahead.
- Great. Thanks very much.
- OK. Bye.
- Bye! We're off to lowa.
[Country western music playing]
* You heard me right *
* Yeow! *

* Whoo *
How do you feel about
our choices in the election?
- I don't care which way it goes.
- You what?
- I don't care which way it goes.
- Why is that?
Because I just don't have
no interest in it.
I wish we had a better choice,
but we gotta pick between...
What would you call it?
Between two evils.
MOORE: Yeah, or I call it
"the evil of two lessers."
How you guys doing
with your jobs right now?
I work harder than
I ever had to work in my life.
My kids are all grown up...
and I gotta work harder today
than I did 20 years ago.
You gotta pay your rent,
your electric, your water...
your gas and food
and clothes for your kids.
And there's no money left.
MOORE: At the end
of the month, that's it.
- No. There's nothin' left.
- And you're working two jobs?
- Yeah.
- And raising your kids?
I have two little girls.
MOORE: How do you do that?
How do you work two jobs?
I work mornings at one
and nights at the other.
- Every day?
- Just about.
When do you get to see
your kids?
WOMAN:
I don't, not that often.
On the weekends,
on a Sunday...
in the afternoon,
'cause Fairway's not open.
MOORE: That would be like
if you're divorced...
you get to see them
on the weekends.
Yeah, and I'm not divorced.
I'm married
and have a husband...
and I still
don't get to see them...
because of the way it is
in America and around the world.
It's just not fair.
Any words of advice
to your fellow American voters?
- Don't vote.
- Don't vote?
If you have to pick
between them two, don't vote.
MOORE: Hey, guys, do you get
the feeling we're gonna have...
the lowest turnout ever
in an election?
TIA: Yeah.
MOORE: It's depressing.
Let's go to McDonald's.
MAN: Is everybody stabilized
for driving here?
MOORE: I think "stabilized"
is the wrong word...
to be used as
you're eating this stuff.
Are there any napkins in there?
Hey, they put vegetables
on my fish filet.
Fuckers.
MOORE: Do you ever wonder
what happened to Steve Forbes?
He appeared from nowhere.
Had you heard of him before?
Honest. Come on. Honest.
You heard of his dad,
but have you heard of him?
No. Have you
heard of him since?
Did you ever notice
when he was on TV...
his eyes never blinked?
Right?
I mean, they never blinked.
I saw him on Larry King.
He didn't blink.
The whole time, the whole hour,
he never blinked.
A couple nights later,
he was on "Nightline."
They had the camera on him
for a full minute.
Not once did the eyes blink.
FORBES: race was about
principles and issues.
These principles are bigger
than a single candidate...
bigger than a single campaign.
I'm thinking,
"This is very strange,"
so I called up
New York Hospital...
and asked for a doctor...
in the Eyes, Ears, Nose
and Throat Division.
And I said, "Doctor,
I'm watching TV right now...
"and there's a guy on there...
"and his eyes have not blinked
for a full minute.
"Is that possible?"
He said, "No.
"The human eye needs to blink
every 15 or 20 seconds."
I said, "I'm telling you,
now we're into two minutes.
"This guy's eyes...
They've not blinked, not once."
And the doctor said,
and I quote...
"Well, that's not human."
[Laughter]
I'm getting a theory
going here in my head, you know?
Not human. Right?
I'm thinking,
"Don't look in his eyes.
"Don't look in his eyes.
Look away. Don't."
You don't look at his eyes,
but he gets us with the sound.
"Flat tax, flat tax,
flat tax, flat tax..."
Aah! Turn that sound down!
"Flat tax, flat tax, flat tax."
MOORE, CONTINUING:
So back in February...
I was here in Des Moines,
for the lowa caucuses...
and I decided to go over
to the Forbes headquarters...
to see if
Steve was some kind of...
freak X-File
brother from another planet.
And this guy comes out...
and he says,
"Hi, my name is Chip Carter."
"Chip Carter?
That's Jimmy Carter's son."
"No, I'm the other Chip Carter."
He had this weird look
in his eyes too.
MOORE: How long
has Mr. Forbes been here?
Really only been
on the ground 6 to 8 weeks.
Invasion of lowa.
Invasion of
the Body Snatchers in lowa.
Steve Forbes was born where?
I have no idea.
I can't remember.
You don't know?
[Laughter]
Where did Steve Forbes
come from?
Steve Forbes seems to have
come from nowhere.
- Right?
- Pretty much.
Where is nowhere?
It's somewhere out there.
[Laughter]
I'm freakin' out, man.
I'm thinkin'...
"OK, I'm in the Ramada
in Des Moines tonight...
"and I'm triple
dead bolting the door."
"I am not gonna die
in Des Moines...
"you know, taken away
by these space beings...
"calling themselves
the Forbes campaign."
Where are you taking
the spaceship here after lowa?
I'm gonna go home to Oklahoma
for a few days and rest...
and then they'll send me
to another state.
[Chuckles]
OK. Um, all right.
Uh, I think we should
probably let him go.
MOORE: So anyways,
the guy has disappeared, right?
And the only time
that now you have any idea...
that they're still with us
is if you ever notice...
certain people
reading the publication...
with the name Forbes...
the name of their leader...
on the magazine.
Usually men
in three-piece suits...
white guys that look like
they got a lot of money.
They're the aliens.
Beware of these people
who read "Forbes" magazine.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
[Chattering]
MOORE: As I was
signing copies of my book...
I was handed an anonymous note.
It read, "Hey, Michael...
"we're organizing here
at Borders in Des Moines.
"There's a secret meeting
statewide tomorrow night.
"We thought
you should know that...
"we, the ragtag employees
at Borders are not allowed...
"to do the book table
for your reading.
"Only management
is here tonight...
"selling your book
to these people.
"Borders headquarters
in Ann Arbor...
"says they're
protecting us from you.
"Ah, well, you know the shtick.
Take care."
They were awfully happy
that you were here.
Great.
MOORE: This was not
my first strange encounter...
with the Borders book store
chain on my tour.
At their Philadelphia store
I had refused...
to cross a picket line
blocking their entrance...
and instead I had brought
the protesters...
inside with me to my reading.
That resulted in Borders
refusing to let me speak...
at my scheduled appearance
the following week...
in their New York store.
So, we got your note inside.
You're the people
that work at Borders?
Mm-hmm.
And you're trying
to organize the store?
MAN: Yeah.
MOORE: And you wanted to meet me
out here in the dark?
What's going on?
Well, we're actually...
Tomorrow night is
an organizational meeting.
The entire store
is getting together...
and we're meeting
with an organizer...
and we're gonna go from there.
- Because why?
- Because... There's a car.
MOORE: Who's that?
WOMAN: It's no one. It's...
MOORE: They told me...
they were afraid
of being seen with me...
because the Borders
regional manager...
had shown up to the event
unannounced...
with a man
they didn't recognize.
MAN: I don't even know
who that person is.
WOMAN: No.
We don't even like...
MAN: I don't want to think
about who that person was.
WOMAN:
We're afraid enough as it is.
SECOND WOMAN:
Some corporate thug.
MAN: Yeah. Some union buster
guy from Omaha.
Borders workers such as
yourselves were not allowed...
to work the table here
at the event tonight?
BOTH: Right.
Only management
could work the table?
MAN: Yes.
WOMAN: Field the questions.
To protect us.
MOORE: Protect you from what?
From me?
MAN: I don't know. I even asked.
Pointedly, I said...
"You mean you don't want us
to hear what he has to say?"
Everybody in the store
bought your book...
after they put the crunch on.
MOORE: [Laughing]
After they what?
WOMAN: Well,
we felt this pressure...
MAN: After we all got
kicked off the table...
we said,
"What's in this book?"
MOORE: Right.
"Why can't we be here?"
MAN: It was really interesting.
MOORE: They then told me
that Borders was deducting...
money from their paychecks
for a health plan...
that had no doctor
in Des Moines.
We don't actually have
health benefits at the moment.
We're paying for them.
We started
paying for them in April...
but we don't have them.
So that was what really
galvanized a lot of people.
They were sort of like...
"I'm paying for
all of this and it's not..."
So it's actually,
we don't have any benefits.
Almost everybody
in the store has another job.
MOORE: Mm-hmm. Really?
You have to work a second job
if you work at Borders?
- Yes.
- You have to do it.
MOORE: To pay the bills.
What do you...
MAN:
We make six bucks an hour.
MOORE: What second jobs
do you guys work?
Discount retail store.
MOORE: Yeah. In addition
to working at Borders?
They post the results
by our time cards,
So you sit there and you look at
these long numbers...
of how much over profit
we're doing...
and how well we're doing...
and then you're punching
in and out...
and you're getting
your little paycheck...
with your big hunk
for health insurance...
that you can't use.
MOORE: After taxes,
what's your paycheck?
WOMAN:
Mine's usually about 325.
MAN: That's every two weeks.
MOORE: Every two weeks?
So that's about, what?
A hundred and sixty a week.
About 8,000 a year, after taxes.
What do you want?
What do you hope
the union will get you?
We're not asking
for 15 bucks an hour.
We're not even asking for ten.
- You'd be happy with...
- Good God. Eight.
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Michael.
Thank you very, very much.
I really support you.
And I'll do what I can
to help you win.
MOORE: We headed off
to Rockford, Illinois...
which, like my hometown
of Flint, Michigan...
had just been named
by "Money"magazine...
as the worst city
in the country.
Driving through Rockford,
I realized...
there were
other similarities to Flint.
We had game show host
Bob Eubanks.
They had actress
Susan Saint James.
Culturally, we had
Grand Funk Railroad...
and they had those
"I want you to want me"guys...
Cheap Trick.
Random House
had arranged for me...
to speak that night
at the local Media Play.
[ltalian accent]
No photos, please. No photos.
MOORE: Media Play
was a sprawling complex...
that sold books, CDs, videos,
and you could probably get...
a ten-minute lube job
while you wait.
Which way to home appliances?
I was really excited
to learn that Rick Nielsen...
the lead guitarist
from Cheap Trick...
lived just down the road.
So I asked Media Play's
P.R. Director, Pat...
if she knew if he was in town.
I think she was worried
I was gonna go off...
and hang with him,
so she told me...
he was absolutely,
definitely not in Rockford.
Why did I come to Rockford?
I really wanted
to go to some cities...
other than the ones
they usually send authors to...
New York, Los Angeles,
Boston, Washington, right?
And nobody
ever comes to Rockford.
Right? And I know
what that's like...
because I lived in Flint
most of my life.
Nobody ever comes to Flint.
MAN: Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
[People chattering, laughing]
How ya doin', Mike?
- Who's this to?
- Laura.
- L-a...
- U-r-a.
What do you do here?
- What do I do?
- Yeah.
I sell cars.
Oh, yeah?
What kind of cars?
Fords.
And I got laid off today.
Today? Oh, I'm sorry.
Wow.
And this just happened today?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you have kids?
No, and I don't have kids.
But I don't know
how they expect the people...
30 to 45 to be able
to support their parents...
with jobs that they don't
have any benefits...
on themselves, at minimum wage.
MOORE: I'm really sorry.
Can I give you a hug?
I'll come over there.
OK? I'm really, really sorry.
Yeah. That's OK.
I tell ya,
every city I go to...
every day,
this is what's goin' on.
You are not alone in this.
Well, I know that, and I'm...
That's why
I'm glad that you're here...
and just seeing you
meant a whole lot to me.
There you go.
"Downsized but not out."
LAURA: Well, that's true.
All right, hang in there, OK?
Really. Seriously, man. OK?
- Thank you very much.
- I'm really sorry.
Thanks for coming to Number 300.
MOORE: Ha ha! Fellow 300-ite.
That's right.
Good luck, Flint, Michigan.
All right. Take care.
Any advice for... You came from
the worst city in America.
Now you are in
the worst city in America...
according to "Money" magazine.
Any advice for the beleaguered
Rockford residents?
Yes. I've been to 20 cities
so far in this tour...
and the entire country
has seen the effects...
of what it's like
to be downsized...
while these companies
have gotten filthy rich...
and lots of people
have lost their jobs.
MOORE: Rick from Cheap Trick
is not in town?
PAT: No. They're not in town.
MOORE: They're not in town?
And how do you know that?
PAT: Oh, we have our ways.
MOORE: How do you feel
about how it went tonight?
PAT: I hear that
you only run about 3%.
People that listen to you
only have about 3% book sales.
To me, you mean?
That what they're saying?
Basically, yeah.
You have a lot of people
that listen to you talk...
but they don't buy the book.
Right. Good point.
So, now, where do you get
those numbers, from the reps?
- Mostly. Yeah.
- From Random House?
Mm-hmm. Those people tell you
a lot of things.
Yeah.
Like who have you talked to?
Other stores. Other areas.
Give me an example.
Barnes and Noble tonight
was really scared...
because they thought
you were over there tonight...
and they were worried.
They had no books.
Why don't they have any books?
I don't know why.
- They sold out, or...
- Probably didn't buy any.
You don't think they bought any
at the Barnes and Noble.
I want to review now what
I've learned from you tonight.
Number one...
only 3% of the people...
who come to hear me speak
have actually bought a book.
Mmm, no. That's low.
MOORE: Three percent?
I mean, there were
100 or more people here...
and they sold
just over 100 books.
You know, it's a great
sell-through on an event.
Usually, if you can sell
at a ratio of 50%...
you're doing great.
Number two... Barnes and Noble
didn't have any books...
because they probably
didn't order any books.
Correct!
WOMAN:
It's been just a real...
MOORE: Right.
Oh! These are all yours?
We were told
that they had no books here.
That it wasn't even ordered.
WOMAN: Seriously?
- Yeah.
- Told by who?
Somebody down the street there
at Media Play.
WOMAN: You can't always
believe everything you hear.
MOORE:
Yeah, I guess so, huh?
Last time we send people
down there, huh?
Number three... Rick from
Cheap Trick is not in town.
PAT: Nope.
Here's something you might know.
It's three chords.
* For your love
I'd give you anything *
* And more that's for sure *
* For your love
do, do, do, do, do *
* Do, do, do, do *
You wrote a song, you know.
Too bad
the Yardbirds already did it.
- Yeah, right.
- They already covered it.
[Imitating Bob Dylan]
* Come, senators, congressmen *
* Please heed the call *
* Don't stand in the doorways *
* Don't block up the hall *
* For he who has stalled
is he who is bald *
* Oh, the outside *
[Humming]
* It'll rattle your windows
and you'll shake like a stone *
* For the times
they are a-changin' *
Oh!
[Both humming]
* For the times
they are a-changin' *
[Laughing]
* The answer my friend *
Forget this book tour.
Forget the movie crap. Come on!
I could be a Dylan impersonator.
On the road, baby. You're it.
I am on the road.
Forty-seven cities.
- That's commendable, you know.
- How do you guys do this?
It's travel and perform,
travel and perform.
That's, uh... you, uh...
You kind of look forward
to a day off.
- I did Media Play in Rockford.
- So did we.
- You did Media Play?
- You're dang right we did.
- I don't feel so bad now.
- Oh, thanks.
But I walked in there thinking,
"What is this?"
I felt like that scene
in "Spinal Tap", you know?
"Puppet show and Michael Moore,
appearing tonight."
MOORE: What's your advice
for Milwaukee?
RICK: Well, where are you going?
We're going
to Schwartz's book store.
Yeah, we're playing there next.
You've never played Schwartz's.
BOTH: * On the road again *
Good night, everybody. Peace.
[Country western music playing]
* I didn't understand
till I was grown *
* Why my daddy didn't spend
a little time at home *
* Instead of runnin'
'round the country *
* That way *
* Whoa *
* I'm lookin' at the world
through a windshield *
* Seein' everything in
a little bit different light *
* I got a sweet little thing *
* That I'm dyin' to see
in Nashville *
Milwaukee is not a New York
or a Chicago or an L. A...
so we don't tend to have as many
high-profile celebrity types...
movie stars, et cetera.
So we tend to get people...
who don't take themselves
quite so seriously in Milwaukee.
We're considered more
of a second-tier city...
so we get
more thoughtful people...
who are literary writers
or nonfiction writers...
or like Michael,
who is doing...
really kind of
an interesting book tour.
His is the most
fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants...
book tour I've ever seen...
and I've been doing this
for seven years...
where things are
just sort of scratched...
and things are added,
and people want him constantly,
to talk to him,
to chat with him...
and he obliges,
which is very nice...
but it throws
the schedule a curve.
MAN:
How does that make your life?
MARY: Do I have a twitch yet?
MOORE: Union leaders have hopped
into bed with management...
over the last two decades...
and every time management
snapped their fingers...
unions would jump...
and they gave
all these concessions...
in the '80s... Remember that?
MAN: One of the, actually,
very funny pieces...
in this book
is about your attempt...
to see if candidates would
accept money from anybody.
MOORE: Right.
Tell us about your campaign
contributions that you made...
Michael! We have to go!
MAN: What were you saying?
I said he needs a mother.
He's making me repeat this.
I really don't want
to be yelling at you.
MOORE:
You haven't yelled at all.
You're the kindest escort
I've had.
MARY: Oh, well,
then I can get tougher.
MOORE: Yeah.
You're way too easy on me.
[Alarm wailing]
What the hell?
We got an air raid going here.
MARY: That's the noon whistle.
MOORE:
That's the noon whistle?
That's a frightening
noon whistle.
Does that happen every noon?
- I think so.
- What's the point of that?
MARY: I think it means
that you can have lunch now.
MOORE: Well, that's true.
Actually,
I lived in a town like that.
MAN: Johnson Controls...
whose worldwide headquarters
are located in Milwaukee...
announced
today they are closing...
their Milwaukee
Humboldt facility.
Johnson Controls...
a major supplier
to the auto industry...
of engine parts,
seat covers and hydraulics...
said the Milwaukee production
is being moved to Mexico.
[Moore sighs]
[Turn signal clicking]
MOORE: Just turn in right here.
[Clicking continues]
[Whistling]
MAN: What's the deal here?
We're not gonna get...
MOORE: The deal is
you never turn the camera off.
That's the deal.
Let's go. Ready?
Everybody ready?
I'm on? I'm on, right?
MAN: What's going on right here?
MARY:
I'd like to know that, too.
I'd like to know
what they did on the inside.
I'm trying to stay out
of the way of Johnson Controls.
Actually, I heard a siren...
and I thought maybe that had
something to do with Michael...
and so I decided
I'd get into my car...
rather than being rousted
by the police...
But it was
an ambulance going by.
MAN: Do you know why
he went in to Johnson Controls?
MARY: I know that they've just
laid off a lot of people...
but I don't know specifically
what he was doing in there.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- And you are?
- I'm Bev Jakowsky.
- And you're with?
- Johnson Controls.
Do you know Mr. Keyes,
the chairman?
- I do.
- Yes?
Well, I would like
to present him with a check...
a little gift from me,
a going-away present.
I don't think
this is appropriate.
Hi. How ya doing?
I'm Michael Moore.
Hi, Michael.
Hi. I just brought
a little present here for you.
Eighty cents to pay
the first Mexican worker...
for the first hour of work.
This is what you'll be paying
Mexicans down there...
eighty cents an hour.
And, just to help out,
you know...
because I guess you're hitting...
You've had hard times, right?
No, we haven't had hard times.
MOORE: You've only made
a half a billion dollars...
in the last
three years in profits.
Yeah, our company
is reasonably successful...
and we're committed
to continuing to be successful.
MOORE: Why would you leave
Milwaukee if you're successful?
Because we need to remain
competitive in our businesses.
- Thanks very much for coming...
- You want to be more successful?
We need to continue
to be successful. That's right.
MOORE: And the families here
who will lose their jobs?
The families who are here
who will leave their jobs...
we're gonna do the best
we can...
to help them out
in making the transition.
MOORE: To where, Mexico?
The families are going
to Mexico with you?
To help them find other jobs
at Johnson Controls...
or other good jobs for them
going forward.
So thanks very much.
We appreciate it.
- Will you take this?
- Sure. Thank you.
All right. Eighty cents.
Give it to Mr. Keyes.
OK. Very good.
- Any way I could meet him?
- I'm afraid he's unavailable.
Because, actually,
I have another present for him.
This is the Downsizer
of the Year award...
and you win it for Milwaukee.
Each city that
I'm in on my book tour...
I'm giving out
various Downsizer Awards...
to the companies that make
millions in profits...
and then throw people
out of work.
And because you've done that
here in Milwaukee...
I want to thank you.
You're sure
Mr. Keyes won't see me?
Yeah. I'm afraid
he's not available.
- I'd like to request...
- But he is here?
He's unavailable.
I'm really not sure...
You should tell him I'm here.
He'll know who I am.
- I'm not sure...
- He supplies G.M.
I would like to request that
if you'd like to come back...
make an appointment,
we can talk some more.
MOORE: I'd be glad
to make an appointment.
But I'd like to request...
Jack, if you could help me out?
Jack, how ya doin'?
Michael Moore.
- What's your job here?
- Jack Higgins.
- What do you do here?
- Human resources.
That's always
my favorite department...
because they take care of
the people here, right?
All the people that
you're gonna be laying off.
The human resources?
It's not actually in my area...
but, yes,
we will be dealing with that.
- What does human resources do?
- OK. Let's hold on.
I think
we've had enough discussion.
MOORE: You brought
Jack out here to talk to us.
Yeah, Jack came out
to keep us company.
We've had our little discussion.
Thanks very much for coming.
I wish you had called
to let us know...
and maybe we would have been
better prepared...
for your cameras and your show.
We wish you would have called
and told all the workers...
so they would have been
better prepared.
- They were.
- Yeah. Yeah.
We've been talking with
our employees continually.
They've known this
for years, right?
That you'd be leaving here?
Each year, as you made
a bigger and bigger profit...
they knew
you would leave Milwaukee...
because they did such a good job
you made so much money.
I think our employees have got
a much better understanding...
of what's happening than you do.
I have 20 years here,
coming on Friday...
and we were told yesterday...
that the entire plant
would be closed.
MAN: You know where
they're gonna relocate?
Yes. It's going to Mexico.
Reynosa, Mexico.
MAN: Once you're laid off,
what's your plan?
I don't have one right now.
I don't know.
You know, I have
to see what my options are...
and go from there.
MOORE: I asked Ed
if he'd like to head over...
to Manpower, Incorporated...
the temp agency
whose world headquarters...
just happened to be
located in Milwaukee.
Manpower... a company
that guarantees you...
a job for a day...
was now the number-one employer
in the country.
We thought, seeing how
this is such a great company...
maybe we could get Ed
a temp job.
I want to thank you
for stopping by...
and I wish
I could help you further...
at this point,
but you took me by surprise...
and I'd like to find out more
about the situation.
MOORE: How about an application
for Ed to get a temp job?
- Please?
- No?
- Thanks.
- No?
Milwaukee was a great base
for manufacturing...
and there's really nobody left.
And now, we were one of
the biggest companies here...
and now we're going...
so I don't know
what we're going to do.
[Applause]
You know, whenever
I fly to one of these cities...
I usually get stuck next to
some businessman...
who, after having
a couple of martinis...
Iooks over at me
and, you know...
[Gruff voice] "Who are you?
Oh, yeah. Roger Moore."
[Laughter]
"I know you.
You made that movie.
"What have you got
against profit?"
That's what
they have to say, right?
"What have you got
against profit?
"Company's got a responsibility
to its shareholders.
"That's our system...
the shareholders."
[Chuckles]
That's not our system.
Our system's a democracy.
I've read
the U.S. Constitution.
The word "shareholder" does not
appear once in that document.
[Applause]
I've seen the word "people"...
of, by, and for the people...
I've seen that...
but I've not seen the word
"shareholder."
But, you know,
that's what they like to say.
They like to spout off
with that stuff, don't they?
The shareholders. Profit.
"Company should be able to do
whatever it can...
"to make a profit, Mike.
"You can't stop a company
from doing that."
Yes, we can. [Laughs]
We have a democracy.
We can do whatever we want.
We can pass
whatever law we want...
as long as it fits
into that Constitution.
We can pass any law we want.
We do it all the time.
If it's just about profit...
If it's just
about making a profit...
well, then, why doesn't
General Motors sell crack?
[Laughter]
Huh? They could make
a huge profit selling crack.
A 2,000-pound car makes G.M.
about a $1,000 profit.
Two thousand pounds of crack,
there's a million bucks there.
So why don't they sell crack?
MAN: The CIA's
got the market cornered.
MOORE:
The CIA has got the market.
[Laughter, applause]
Where are the Republicans...
when you want to
privatize something, right?
[Laughter]
Actually,
that's what we need to do.
We need to turn crack
over to General Motors...
because they'll really
screw it up, you know?
We'll eliminate crack
in five years...
if we just turn it over
to General Motors.
They'll completely mismanage
the whole thing, right?
MOORE: Oh, my God!
We made the "New York Times"
best-seller list.
[Laughing] Oh, man!
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
That's such good news.
Have you called Kathleen?
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, I'm stunned!
They must be flipping out
there at Random House.
Yeah, OK. All right.
All right.
TIA: Ha ha!
Rockford pushed us over.
MOORE: Rockford!
It was Rockford! Ha ha!
How do I feel about the book
being sold by a corporation?
MAN: Yeah. Did you ever
consider trying to sell it...
at just non-corporate
book stores?
MOORE: You know, I did,
until I made...
the "New York Times"
best-seller list.
Now I don't think corporations
are such a bad idea.
Flat tax isn't
a bad idea either...
come to think of it.
Thank you.
MOORE: At the state capitol
in Wisconsin...
I accompanied
a group of women...
whose welfare benefits
had just been cut...
by the Republican governor,
Tommy Thompson...
and the Democratic president,
Bill Clinton.
Joining us,
quite unexpectedly...
were two morning deejays
from the local rock station.
And the Crash-and-Burns Crew
here on WJJO...
and we're gonna offer
to clean up his office...
to show him that
these people want their money...
and they're willing
to work for it.
Man, I'm winded.
[Chattering]
- Michael Moore.
- Michael.
Good to meet ya.
Governor Thompson here?
No, he's actually...
he's out of state.
He's out of state?
We brought some people here
who are recipients of welfare.
They would like to come in and
clean the governor's office.
They brought mops, brooms,
some dust pads...
We already have people
who do that.
But they want to give it
an extra polish.
MAN: lt'd be a lot cheaper.
Yeah. Because
you're already paying them.
We have people
who are paid to do that.
But you know the governor's
worried about welfare.
People not wanting to work.
We give them jobs
where they don't...
They don't even have
to get welfare benefits.
They'll get a real paycheck.
MOORE: You'll give them
real jobs with real paychecks?
- Sure, we'll help them.
- Where they won't be evicted?
They'll have enough money
to pay rent and get food?
You'll do that
for these women right now?
We'll set them up with people
who'll help them do that.
- Right now you will?
- Sure. Where are they from?
What kind of wage
are you gonna pay them here?
- Pardon?
- What kind of wage?
Most people who are leaving
welfare right now...
are makin' $6.00 an hour.
WOMAN: Do you realize
that the average job...
starts at
5.25 to 5.75 an hour?
KEANE: First of all,
let me explain something.
Say it is 5.25 an hour,
and you're makin' 5.25 an hour.
You will have,
at the end of the year...
5,000 dollars more
real income in your pocket...
than being on the A.F.D.C.
I don't want to be on A.F.D.C.
I'm a full-time student
working now...
KEANE: That's my point.
If you're workin',
even at that $5.00-an-hour job,
if you just
look at the pure cash...
the pure dollars,
you're makin' more money...
at that $5.00-an-hour job
than you are on the A.F.D.C.
WOMAN: But I'm not gettin'
medical benefits, dental...
KEANE: Sure you will.
Wait a minute. My children
are not gonna be covered.
Who's gonna pay
for my child care?
KEANE: Seriously, ma'am,
if you went to the job center...
WOMAN: I'm goin' there now!
That's what I'm tellin' you now.
We already at the job center.
We're already
on the Pay for Performers.
We've already been through
the goals program.
We've already took the classes.
I'm still getting sanctioned,
I still don't have a job...
and I'm still on welfare.
MAN: What do you think
of all this?
I'm staying out of the way.
You know my problem.
MAN: What's your problem?
Well, Governor Thompson
is a personal friend...
and the lieutenant governor
is also a personal friend...
and I really don't want them
to see me here...
and wonder
what the heck I'm doing.
Roger Smith,
my old buddy, all right?
Here's Governor Thompson
giving a welfare check to Roger.
- Yeah.
- OK?
And how many jobs
did that help create...
for people that you're
complaining about to work?
MOORE: How many jobs has G.M.
eliminated in the last 10 years?
Since Tommy Thompson's
been in office...
they've had more jobs
in this state.
- General Motors?
- Been in office.
Yes. Since Tommy Thompson
has been in office.
MOORE: Come on!
You complain about people
getting their jobs back...
What I want you to do is stop
giving away the free money.
KEANE: You just want
to have an issue.
Stop giving away the free money
to the corporations.
We wanna work! We wanna work!
Where's my broom at?
My toilet brush?
There's something stink
up in this capitol.
I am a mother of 4 children.
Full-time student.
My youngest child
will be a year, November 21.
I am trying to better myself
in order to get a job...
where I can afford to live
above the poverty line...
and it's just not working.
WOMAN: See that sign?
Say justice.
Where's mine?
Where's my justice?
This way? Come on, pumpkin.
Tommy Thompson.
[Laughter]
[Booing, hissing]
What bad experience did he have
in junior high school?
[Laughter]
"Hi. I'm Tommy Thompson."
[Laughter]
"Mmm!
I'm gonna take it out...
"on all the people of Wisconsin
when I grow up."
[Laughter, applause]
Tommy Thompson.
I went over to see him today.
[Laughter, cheering]
I went over there
to turn in some welfare mothers.
[Laughter]
To turn in
some welfare mothers...
because I am sick and tired
of these lazy welfare bums...
these cheats, these chiselers...
General Motors, Chrysler,
Johnson Controls...
Pabst Blue Ribbon, Miller,
et cetera, et cetera.
[Cheering, applause]
The people of Wisconsin
have been doling out...
way too much welfare money
to these corporations.
Do you know, nationwide,
we give $170 billion a year...
to corporate America
in corporate welfare?
That's free cash,
free handouts.
Three times what we give
in social welfare. Three times.
We don't hear a word
about that, though, do we?
We don't hear Tommy Thompson
wanting to end welfare...
as he knows it.
[Music playing]
Sure.
I got 20 cities
left to go, all right?
- So you're at number 27 now?
- Yes.
You've done this before.
This is my first time.
What is your advice for me
on this tour?
How do I get through this?
One person at a time,
you look them in the eye.
You shake their hand.
You do whatever they want.
- Become a passive individual.
- Right.
You give up all sense
of personal will or preference.
- Right.
- You are meat.
Any advice on how
to deal with the escorts?
The escorts?
Don't even get into that, Mike.
Don't get involved with that.
It's not a good thing.
Take cold showers
and go to church.
* Kyrie eleison *
* Christe eleison *
* Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah *
[Laughs]
This... [Laughs]
Sister Herman in fifth grade...
she taught us
about impure thoughts.
Fifth grade, all right?
She did two things to us
in fifth grade.
She taught us
what impure thoughts were...
and she used to
come into the boys' room...
during the two times of the day
you could go to pee...
they march you down
in a straight line...
you go in and pee...
and she'd come in there
and watch us pee...
to make sure that we weren't
playing with ourselves.
I swear.
[Laughter]
And if it looked like you were
having too much fun peeing...
she'd go like this,
"Tsk, tsk, tsk."
So one day I said...
"Sister, when is
an impure thought a venial sin
"and when is it a mortal sin?"
You know, venial sins,
you just go to purgatory...
mortal sins, you burn in hell.
And she said... and I quote...
"A venial sin is when
you just allow the thought...
"to pass quickly through
your head without holding it.
"It just goes
right through your head."
Whoosh!
[Laughter]
"That's a venial sin.
"But if you hold that thought
for more than five seconds...
"it's a mortal sin."
Yeah. So I spent
most of my adolescence...
timing my impure thoughts.
"5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
OK! It's gone!
"It's gone!
"Here comes another one. OK!
"5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
"Oh, Lucifer, here I come!"
We were over at
the Mall of America before...
[Audience booing]
Oh! "No, we don't go
to the Mall of America.
"No. No. We're going to
the student union after this...
"to listen to multicultural
folk music from Cuba...
"and eat tofu from Nicaragua.
"Mall of America...
"we don't want to be there
with those people."
What a great place, man.
I wish I'd spent
the whole day there.
We met... Ha! ...we met
some incredible people.
We met this guy...
and I said, "Did you vote
in the last election?"
He was probably
in his early 20s.
He said, "No. I was in prison."
- Yeah, I was in Ventura.
- You were in that prison?
California Youth Authority.
Yeah, I was.
MOORE: Where TWA has
that reservation thing?
Yeah.
If you call TWA
at certain times of the day...
to make
a plane reservation...
you're talking to an inmate
in Ventura, California.
He goes, "Yeah, that was us."
[Laughter]
MOORE: So you mean,
you're in prison...
and you're taking
airline reservations.
And you're sending people
to the Bahamas...
and you can't even walk outside?
MAN: I think it's, like,
a "corporational" thing...
so TWA doesn't have
to hire people...
and they can pay less.
Because if you go
into a job at TWA...
they're gonna pay you
7, 8, 9 bucks an hour.
MOORE: Any funny stories?
People calling for reservations?
MAN: Yeah, there's all kinds.
How people get phone numbers
and get hookups...
and, you know, like,
girls'll be calling...
and they'll be, like,
"Hey, what's your name?"
Your normal stuff
that would probably happen...
if you were working at TWA,
but they don't realize that...
what they're really talking to
are rapists or murderers...
or, you know,
people that are just like...
They talk about how
they're supposed to change kids.
- Yeah.
- I came out as a murderer.
I don't give a fuck about
you, you, you, you.
Anybody in here. You know?
- Why should I?
- You don't give a shit?
Nah.
Nobody gives a shit in there.
MOORE:
You don't give a shit about me?
No. I don't care about...
I do not care about nobody.
And that is
your basic society nowadays.
MOORE: You could fuck me up
right now if you wanted to?
Yeah. I wouldn't care.
- You wouldn't care?
- No. I wouldn't.
So next time
you're, like, treating...
that person on the phone
really shitty...
because they can't find
your frequent flyer number...
just remember...
you could get a visit someday.
[Laughter]
Isn't that sick, though?
I mean, corporations
are using prison labor.
We're not talking
about China, here.
We're talking about
the U.S. of A.
Spaulding packages
their golf balls...
in prisons in Hawaii.
Microsoft packages software
in prisons in Washington.
Eddie Bauer has clothes made
in prisons in Washington state.
You aware of this?
If you live in Colorado...
and you're getting a call
from AT&T...
AT&T uses prisoners to do
their telemarketing for them.
They're calling people
at 9:00 at night...
asking them to switch from MCI,
and they're doing 20 to life.
And what do you think
they're getting paid?
Virtually nothing.
Why don't we just close down
all the factories...
throw everyone out of work,
right?
A number of them
will obviously turn to crime...
because they'll be unemployed.
We can then ship them
back into the factory...
which can now be a prison...
and they can do their old job,
which they're trained to do...
and get paid
two dollars an hour...
and the company can make
a huge profit.
What a great idea! Huh?
Then the Dow can hit 10,000.
MOORE: Yeah!
MAN: But, you know,
it's kind of a new generation...
of media guides
coming in now, and...
MOORE: Could we change
the name to media guide...
or something,
but not escort?
- Literary gigolo?
- Yeah. Ha ha!
MOORE: Minneapolis is
the headquarters for Pillsbury,
which has been
using federal funds...
to send their doughboy
to the Third World.
[Speaking Spanish]
Pillsbury Doughboy!
[Speaking Spanish]
[Giggles]
MOORE: This escort
would be the first...
to join me
as a partner in crime.
OK, now, one side of it
is coming up here on the left.
This is probably gonna be
our easiest way to approach it.
MOORE: Huh?
- Hi, how you doing?
- You wanna shut that off?
- What's wrong?
- You wanna shut it off?
- Yeah, shut it off.
- What are you doing?
We'd like to talk to
the public relations woman.
You don't be taking film
through this building.
You have to have permission
from the building...
before you can do
anything in here.
All we want to ask is about
Pillsbury and $11 million...
GUARD: I don't care.
Come with me.
All right.
Can we film out here?
MOORE: I was allowed to ask
the chairman one question...
as long as I wrote it
on a yellow Post-It note.
OK, so here's the question:
"Why does Pillsbury need...
"$11 million in welfare
for the Doughboy?"
GUARD: All right. What you
should do this afternoon...
is check in here and
they'll have some information.
- But I'll call. 330-5103.
- Yeah.
MOORE: I left Pillsbury
confident they would take...
this Post-It note
to their leader...
and convince him to stop
accepting welfare checks...

Michael Moore? Diane Mitchell
from Chicago Media.
MOORE: Oh, hi.
Are you the new escort?
- Yes, I am.
- How you doin'?
Fine. How 'bout you?
They're ready for you.
They are? OK. All right.
Thanks for being here.
My pleasure, believe me.
Michael is like a floor sample
of what we can all be.
He's a wonderful
floor sample...
and he gives us courage,
you know?
And he says, you know...
"We can make a difference.
Each one of us can.
"And all we have to do
is stand up and stand together."

Hearing that song
of the Thirties...
of the Flint
sit-down strike...
of labor, the CIO...
I'm seated
next to Michael Moore.
Now, many of you
know who Michael Moore is.
And Michael Moore's new book
is called "Downsize This!
"Random Threats
from an Unarmed American."
And so,
just hearing this passage...
from this old Labor song
of the Thirties...
what thought
comes to your mind immediately?
I think of
my uncle Laverne, actually...
who was in that sit-down strike
60 years ago this winter, Studs.
And I think about, you know...
how all of us
gained from that...
and all other labor actions
that came after that.
How the standard of living,
how our health care...
social security, child labor...
All these things came
as a result of the struggle...
that those people
participated in.
And if they could see
what's going on now...
[Scoffs]
We come to the big subject.
We hear the phrase today...
"Since the evil empire
is gone...
"we have a new enemy
called terrorists."
And so you have a picture...
at the beginning of this book,
"Downsize This!"
Two photographs.
"What is terrorism?"
And it's almost... two photographs
almost identical.
Destroyed buildings.
The first one's
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma...
1995, after the bombing.
Down below...
Flint, Michigan, 1996.
And you can hardly tell
the difference.
They're two pieces
of destruction.
So the question is,
"What is terrorism?"
Well, obviously,
if you park a Ryder truck...
in front of a building
filled with explosives...
and blow up that building
and kill 168 people...
that's an act of terrorism.
There's no question about that.
But what do you call it,
Studs...
when you politely remove
the people...
from the building first
and then blow it up?
But in the ensuing years...
the people that used to work
in that building...
because their livelihood
has been stripped from them...
the people
that used work there...
a number of them will die.
They'll die from suicide.
They'll die from spousal abuse.
They'll die from
drugs and alcoholism.
All the social problems
that surround people...
when they become unemployed.
Those people are just as dead as
the people in Oklahoma City...
but we don't call the actions
of the company terrorism, do we?
We don't call
the company a murderer.
But I do consider this
an act of economic terrorism...
when at a time
you're making a record profit...
you would throw people
out of work...
just so you can
make a little bit more.
MOORE: Back when
we were in Centralia...
we had promised
the workers at PayDay...
that when we got to Chicago,
we'd pay their owners a visit.
[Whistling]
I'll write it in for you.
OK.
We're just supposed
to take this...
to the chairman's office...
surprise.
You'd better check
with that girl in there...
- before you go anywhere.
- OK.
WOMAN: Jim, they're not allowed
in here. Get them out.
MOORE: Surprise.
It's PayDay, Friday.
MAN: Wait a minute.
MOORE: I got a check here for
65 cents to buy the last PayDay.
MAN: But who said you guys
could come in here?
- We did.
- Who is Michael Moore?
That's me. I'm Michael Moore.
- Are you security?
- Yeah.
- Huh?
- Outside.
MOORE: What?
We can't wait in here?
- No.
- No. Outside.
Oh, OK. All right.
WOMAN: If you don't,
we'll call the police.
- Call the police?
- Yeah.
MAN: You need to call
the police.
- You can just go outside.
- I'm bringing a present.
MAN: Leave your present
outside the door.
You wanna get outside
the door, please? Huh?
Are they gonna call up?
GUARD: They already did call.
You're not allowed in here.
Outside.
MAN: Yeah, take him outside
the door and wait there.
MOORE: All we wanted...
MAN: The boss is coming
to meet you outside the door.
- The boss is gonna come out?
- Yeah. Outside the door.
MOORE: OK, great.
A $20 million profit.
Will you step outside the door?
I know what you're thinking.
MAN: Go and wait outside
the door.
GUARD: Don't take
pictures of me, now, OK?
You want to go outside, sir?
TIA: Hey, hey, hey!
What the hell are you doing?
MOORE: The boss is coming?
Is he coming down? The boss?
Is he coming down?
[Car horn honks]
TIA: Michael, the guy...
the supplier that just left...
he told me the company was
just sold to Hershey's today.
This company?
Was sold to Hershey's?
- Today?
- Today.
MOORE: Hershey. Today.
They took over
Leaf North America.
Right? OK,
I got the right name now.
Is the boss coming down?
No? You said
he was coming down.
GUARD: He's not coming down.
MOORE: He's not coming down?
Well, you tricked us.
[Sirens wailing]
Oh, man. We've been hoodwinked.
[Tires screeching]
Police are here. Heads up.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- I'm Michael Moore.
- Hi, Michael Moore.
I'm making a documentary film
for the BBC... What's that?
We've been asked
to ask you to leave.
GUARD:
Turn that off, please.
MOORE: They made
a big announcement today...
that Hershey
is taking over Leaf.
- So?
- We just want to talk to...
I understand that, but they
don't want to talk to you...
and this is private property.
They handed out a press release.
We're the press.
We'll leave.
We're not on public property?
- That's right.
- Correct.
- This is private property.
- That's correct.
I asked you
to turn that off.
We'll leave.
Yeah, turn off all the stuff.
This is Michael Moore.
If he asks you again...
we're gonna confiscate
the equipment.
MOORE: All right,
all equipment, off.
All right?
Officer, there's no reason...
put away those handcuffs.
[Door closing]
MOORE: "Wait, wait."
"What's your name? Let me
see your driver's license."
I said, "No, no, no.
You don't understand."
"That's enough."
The guy's getting ready
to read me my rights.
And I said, "Wait a minute.
"You can't arrest me.
I'm on a book tour."
[Audience laughing]
I'm an author.
You can't arrest authors.
[Chuckling]
And the private security
guy's going...
"Arrest him. Arrest him.
We told him.
"We told him
to get off our property...
"and he refused to leave.
"He's trespassing.
Yeah, arrest him."
"Well, wait a minute.
That's not what happened.
"They told us to come outside
and wait for the boss."
"No, we didn't.
That's a lie."
Of course, he'd forgotten
about the people...
that he had pushed
out the door with me.
And so I said
to the officer...
"Officer,
let's roll the videotape."
[Laughing]
[Moore humming Western theme]
I am supposed
to keep them on schedule.
Yes. And thank God
the 2:00 appointment...
was canceled today
or else we'd be in trouble.
Yes, I am, and sometimes
I'm not very popular with them.
Because I have to be a meanie.
MOORE: Well,
she wasn't really a meanie...
but this was
my wedding anniversary...
and my wife
had just flown into town.
I had to find a way
to lose the escort...
and then
I remembered something...
that Rick from Cheap Trick
had suggested.
You ask them to go get you
some cigarettes.
Then you call security.
And while they're out trying
to get you some cigarettes...
even though you don't smoke...
you call security and say...
"This guy,
he's wearing a suit."
And you describe him,
exactly what he looks like...
And you say,
"I don't care what he says.
"He's bothering
the daylights out of me.
"He's nuts. No matter what.
Get rid of him."
- That'll work?
- Oh, yeah.
Tell 'em he's a stalker?
Yeah. But you gotta be
a little mean-spirited.
Yeah. That'll be hard for me.
I doubt it.
[Both laughing]
Can you go get me...
um, like a, uh... something...
Like if you go through
those doors out there...
I think there's
a Coke machine or something.
- Right. Coffee downstairs.
- Coffee downstairs?
You have to go out through
those doors, first, right?
Go out through those doors
and get me one of those.
- OK. Coffee?
- Thanks a lot.
Coffee's great. Thanks.
Thank you very much.
[Chattering]
I would say yes.
She's constantly threatening me.
You can see she has
that stalker look in her eyes.
OFFICER: So you don't want her
anywhere near you?
No. And if you see her
around here...
she might be wearing exactly
what's in that photograph.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you please
put the coffee over here?
I need you to leave
the building right away.
Why?
They're taking her away.
- How is he gonna get back?
- Please walk this way.
OK. Wait a minute!
This is not right.
Yeah, OK. All right.
All right,
we should tell her now.
It's just a joke.
MOORE: Uh-oh. Oh, my...
Where is he taking her?
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
All right, here.
I'll be right back.
Hang on a second, all right?
[All laughing]
You're a sick individual.
We only do this
to people we love.
Get over there.
Go sign your books.
She's right back
to ordering me again. See?
[Country western music playing]
MOORE: You know what I hate
about being in these airports?
Always having to step aside
for those beeping carts...
because someone who's perfectly
capable of walking to the plane
is getting a free ride.
* Gone 500 miles
before the day is done *
* I got a bad case *
* Of the homesick
truck driver blues *
MOORE: Would you tell us
why 13,000 people...
have been laid off here
since 1993?
At a time
of record profits...
when you've made about
$6 billion?
WOMAN: We wanted to keep
this company competitive...
that we needed to do
something today and now...
in order to ensure...
that this company
stayed healthy and profitable.
MOORE: But it's obvious that
you're healthy and profitable.
It's $6 billion.
That's a huge profit.
WOMAN: No, that's not correct.
That's not the...
- Six billion's not huge?
- That's not our profits.
- That's the profit.
- No, it's not.
What is the profit since 1993?
- It's, um...
- You're talking annual profits?
Yes, annual profits since 1993.
Since '93?
If you total it, yes.
That's when the layoffs started.
That's what I'm saying.
During that time of layoffs,
you made, take home, $6 billion.
Do you have any plans of
rehiring any of these people...
now that you've made $6 billion
in the last 3 years?
Well, we are a company
that is promotion from within...
so we are always hiring
because of...
The people who lost their jobs...
Are you gonna bring them back?
We can't say what
we would do as far as anybody...
- Are you doing well?
- Sure, we're doing well.
So, why not share
the wealth a little here?
It's good for the country,
don't you think?
MOORE: How would
you feel about a law...
that prohibits
Procter and Gamble...
from laying people off
when they're making a profit?
I'm not in a position
to really be able...
to respond to that kind of
legislation at this point.
A certificate of achievement...
for the Procter and Gamble
corporation...
success in downsizing.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
And call us
if you have questions...
and we'll be glad to...
MOORE: All right.
I will definitely call you.
- Do we have your card?
- I don't have a card with me.
- A phone number?
- Do you have a card?
No, I don't have a card either.
Who's got a card?
Wait, we've got a card.
Everything on me
has been laundered in Tide.
OK, thank you.
And the Tide that has
the little bit of bleach in it?
- Mm-hmm?
- I think that's great...
because it doesn't create
those white spots...
that some of your competitors
create in their products.
Another technology
we've put into Tide...
that is very effective
is color guard.
So that when you wash
your dark colors...
they're not gonna fade.
See, I'm the kind of guy...
My wife complains
about this all the time...
I refuse to separate
whites from colors.
I just throw them
all in at once.
You can do that with Tide.
It will not bleed
the color of the shirt.
And she's going, "No, no."
She'll never let me
put her underwear in there.
Thank you very much.
We appreciate it.
Thank you. Take care.
That's my pen right there.
DJ: BBC, the Broadbank
Burbcasting Corporation.
In the book...
you talk about what
America needs is a makeover.
When I first saw this,
I'll be honest, Michael...
I thought, is this right
to change things in America?
I mean, we've been...
So long,
we've had the same things.
We've looked up to the flag.
We've looked up to
the symbols of this country.
And you want to change them.
Then I got into it a little bit,
and I do have to admit
you do make a lot of sense.
I'm just trying to say...
"There's nothing wrong with
a little P.R. move here...
"to improve our image."
First of all, the name.
The name is so boring.
It's just a description.
The United States of America.
That's not what they did
over in England.
They called themselves
Great Britain.
- They did.
- Great Britain, you know?
DJ: Boy, that does have
a better feel to it.
Considering there's nothing
great about them.
It's the marketing.
Get the word "great" in there.
You put that on a battleship,
it's coming into harbor...
the natives are going,
"Whoa, run away!"
"Great." United Kingdom.
United Kingdom.
It's not a kingdom.
It's a dinky little island.
"The United States,"
what are we?
It would be like if
the British called themselves...
a bunch of little districts
on an island.
We're the United States
of America, you know?
- You're right.
- Let's knock that off.
What would we change it to?
- The Big One.
- The Big One?
Somebody says,
"Where you from?"
"I'm from The Big One."
And if they don't like it,
"Bite the Big One."
And a new slogan, too,
instead of "In God We Trust."
Let's not say that anymore.
Let's change our new slogan to...
- "Until We Measure Up to God."
- Exactly. Exactly.
So a new slogan I'm suggesting...
"In By Ten, Out By Two."
[All laughing]
DJ: That's pretty good,
I guess. Any others?
"America... A really good place
for a thick, juicy steak."
That doesn't get it
a second time around.
DJ: I like this, too.
"Our citizens are armed,
and they like to shoot."
Man, it's hard to beat that.
MOORE: Then you don't need
to spend so much on defense...
if you just have a good slogan
that scares people.
DJ: And a new symbol
for the country.
You talked about a new symbol.
It was your daughter
that liked the idea of...
MOORE:
We have the bald eagle, right?
We have the bald eagle now.
We're going, "Hey, have you
ever seen a bald eagle?"
- I've never seen a bald eagle.
- Not in person.
My daughter says,
"Hey, how about a bald man?"
I've seen a lot of them,
you know?
A bald man...
that's a symbol for America.
DJ: Everybody wants
to change the national anthem.
MOORE: I've got an idea.
Very simple. Very simple.
We all know it.
We sing it at the ball game.
"We will, we will rock you."
You stand up,
hand over your heart.
* We will, we will rock you *
* We will, we will rock you *
Thank you!
* We will, we will rock you *
* We will, we will rock you *
Attention, Kmart shoppers:
This is a greenlight special
at General Motors.
MOORE: It looks like your robot
just went on strike.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Raise the cameras.
You got some Lemon Pledge...
I can try and
take care of the table.
Whoa. Not bad.
Do you remember
your first vote, Mr. Williams?
It was 1984. Ronald Reagan.
It's a proud moment.
And you've never used any drugs?
I think we should call
Apple right now...
so you could
do a commercial for them.
"I drove over my laptop."
Oh, my God, General Motors!
Sell, sell!
It's going up
just as you're talking here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[Explosion]
No wonder no one votes.
The richest one percent
got two political parties.
There they are.
And we got none.
That doesn't seem fair.
We need our... Hey, wait.
We need our own party.
And get to
the bottom of this truth!
ANNOUNCER:
Congressman Bob Dornan...
who was defeated in
his reelection bid last week...
has filed charges claiming...
illegal Mexicans voted for
his opponent, Loretta Sanchez.
Today,
filmmaker Michael Moore...
visited the offices of
the Orange Country registrar...
and citing California
Election Code Section 2208...
he filed charges claiming...
the people who voted
for Dornan were insane.
Viva Permanente!
...to see the Kaiser!
We want to see the Kaiser!
We want to see the Kaiser!
[Audience applauding]
Hello.
I'm on a campaign, actually...
to get Jesse Helms
put in prison this year.
[Audience laughing, applauding]
Will you join me
in this effort?
Thank you very much
for your support. Thank you.
I appreciate it so much.
- You OK?
- I hope so.
MOORE: After visiting
47 cities in 50 days...
I was on my way
to Portland, Oregon...
my last stop
and the home of Nike...
the largest shoe manufacturer
in the world.
Nike chairman Phil Knight
was named in my book...
as one of
my favorite corporate crooks.
Nike makes most of
their shoes in Indonesia...
using teenage girls...
and paying them less
than 40 cents an hour.
The company has the backing...
of Indonesia's
brutal military regime...
which has committed genocide
in East Timor.
Nike makes no shoes in America.
CROWD:
Shame on you! Shame on you!
MOORE:
When I arrived in Portland...
I found the local citizens
upset about the situation.
CROWD:
Phil Knight can kiss my butt!
MOORE: Uh-oh, Nike has sent in
the Portland police.
Officer, I wear a size 11E.
Thank you.
[Radio theme plays]
DJ: Michael Moore's my guest...
and his new book
is "Downsize This!"
And let's go to Keith in...
Keith in Nike.
- Who's this? Keith Peters?
- That's me.
- Do you work for Nike, Keith?
- Yeah.
OK. What's your question
for Michael?
KEITH: Well, you know,
I'm a big fan of Michael.
I think the movie was great,
and he spent a lot of time...
walking around Michigan
looking for Roger...
and I say,
"Yeah, come on out."
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Is Phil there?
- Yeah.
- And he wants to see Michael?
- Yeah.
MOORE: Whoa. Are you serious?
Is this a prank call?
KEITH: Come on out.
We'll talk whatever you want to.
MOORE: Thank you for the offer.
MOORE: I couldn't believe
the chairman of Nike...
was granting me a visit.
I was met at the door by
P.R. Director Keith Peters...
who warned me
that Phil Knight's wife...
had given Phil my book...
as her wedding anniversary
present to him...
with his face circled.
This was not the way
I wanted to meet...
the first CEO
willing to talk to me.
- Hey. How you doing?
- Good.
Thanks for having me in here.
I appreciate it.
I got a little gift for you.
I always come bearing gifts
whenever I get to meet a CEO...
which I'll tell you
isn't that often.
KNIGHT: Then you don't have
to take too many gifts.
MOORE: No. This is a good one.
You'll like this one.
I've got here two tickets...
one in my name
and one in your name...
for you and I
to go to Indonesia together.
And you show me those factories,
you explain this to me...
What's the date
on those tickets?
- Sunday.
- Oh, no, not a chance.
- No?
- No.
But they're transferable.
I can change it to another day.
No, and I'll tell you...
Seriously. Look at this.
Michael Moore...
I got it right here
in your name here...
And Phil Knight.
Look at this.
You and me
on Singapore Airlines.
- No, no. I'm not going.
- It's a good airline.
It's a great airline.
Here, sit back down.
- We gotta negotiate this deal.
- Have you been there?
- I've never been to Indonesia.
- Oh, you've gotta go.
I can't go between now
and the rest of this year.
Your wife. Remember the wife
that gave you the book?
My wife may make me go.
That's why
I won't tell her about it.
Tell her Michael Moore
came here with a free ticket.
- This is a free ticket, Phil!
- Another anniversary present.
- A free ticket to Indonesia.
- I understand that.
Basically, you've got,
you know...
an underdeveloped country
with a repressive regime.
And the way they pull
themselves out of this thing...
is by having... trade helps them.
That's a separate discussion
from an American company...
going into Indonesia
and working with a regime...
that killed 200,000 people.
That's almost
a form of genocide.
I know that
that's got to bother you.
I don't know you personally...
but I know
you have a conscience.
[Exhales]
I certainly wouldn't approve of
any of that sort of thing.
But, basically... I mean...
how many people were killed
in The Cultural Revolution?
How much is enough?
How much is enough
if you are a billionaire?
Wouldn't it be OK to be
just a half a billionaire?
Wouldn't it be OK
for your company...
to make a little less money...
if it meant providing
some jobs here in this country?
- No, but I mean...
- Just think about this.
I've thought about it a lot,
I'll give you the answer to it.
Basically, what drives me
is not money anymore.
MOORE: Right.
I wouldn't think so.
KNIGHT: And basically,
what I want to do...
before I go to that great
shoe factory in the sky...
is make this as good a company
as I can make it.
I simply have a basic belief,
having been burned on it once...
and really believing
this very strongly...
that Americans
do not want to make shoes.
They don't want to make shoes.
MOORE: That's wrong.
You are wrong.
If I could find 500 people
in Flint, Michigan...
who want to make shoes,
will you open the factory?
I didn't say
they didn't want to make shoes.
I think they don't want
those jobs.
No, if they do...
if they will work those jobs...
will you come to Flint?
[Chuckling]
You'll have to convince me
that they want to make shoes...
and can do so
reasonably economically.
Now, they won't work
for five dollars a day.
I understand that.
- But reasonably economically...
- I will explore it.
You will do that?
I didn't say I'd come.
I said I'll explore it.
MOORE: You'll explore it.
Seriously, now?
- With sincerity.
- I'll shake your hand for that.
- All right. Thank you.
- All right.
Filmmaker Michael Moore
is urging...
the world's largest
athletic shoe company...
to open a factory,
a factory in Flint.
Michael Moore chastised...
the chairman of Nike,
Philip Knight...
criticizing the company...
for making most
of its shoes in Indonesia.
So Moore has come home
to convince Knight.
He's staging an event tomorrow
in front of City Hall.
So tomorrow at noon,
I want to prove him wrong.
I want the people of Flint
who would like to work...
who would like
to have a job at Nike...
to come here and stand
in front of City Hall.
I'll have my film crew here.
Dress warm.
And we'll make
a video message to him...
and show him
that the people of Flint...
if they had an opportunity
to work, would certainly work.
We need jobs! We need jobs!
We need jobs! We need jobs!
Flint needs jobs!
Flint needs jobs!
Flint needs jobs!
Flint needs jobs!
Flint needs jobs!
Flint needs jobs!
Mr. Knight, I'm 37 years old.
For 25 years,
I've been wearing Nike.
If Nike means
that much to me...
Flint should mean
that much to you.
If you don't make 'em here,
we shouldn't buy 'em.
There's a lot of people
in Flint...
and all over Michigan
that need jobs...
but especially in Flint,
and I'm one of those people.
If I can buy my son
these Air Jordans...
and he can wear 'em...
you best believe
I will help you make 'em.
Come to Flint.
MAN: All right!
We're hard workers in this area.
We've been working a long time.
Five generations...
four generations of hard workers
puttin' cars together.
We can put together
your tennis shoe.
Please give us a chance.
Thank you.
- Very impressive.
- So what do you think?
I think that a lot of people
without jobs will take any job,
But that given choice...
Americans really don't want
to work in shoe factories.
I still believe that.
But I just showed you
these people here.
Yeah, they said that.
I think any unemployed person
will say "I would like any job."
Basically, Flint isn't on
our radar screen right now...
as far as a warehouse
or a sales office.
Would you do it
as a personal favor to me?
[Chuckles] No.
MOORE: Phil swore he would
never build a factory in Flint.
But he did present me with
the only American-made...
pair of Nike shoes,
built just for me.
I'll tell you what...
How about this?
Why don't you and I have a race?
We're not gonna have a race.
That was suggested already.
No, how about this?
We'll do a 100-yard dash,
you and me, right?
And if you win,
I'll always wear these Nikes...
wherever I go,
on every TV show, whatever.
If I win, you have to build
the shoe factory...
in Flint, Michigan.
No, there's no race.
How about arm wrestling?
Come on.
I'm not gonna arm wrestle.
You would win that one.
- No, no. Don't assume that.
- I'm not gonna arm wrestle you.
If you win, I'll wear
those Nike shoes forever.
But if I win, we gotta make
some jobs in Flint.
- We're not arm wrestling.
- Come on, Phil.
MOORE: I issued Phil
one last challenge...
to contribute money
to the schools of Flint.
It's very unlikely that
I would make a contribution...
to the Flint schools
in the future.
If I made the contribution,
would you match me?
Um...
I'll contribute
$10,000 to do that...
for the Flint school system
if you'll do that.
- I will match you.
- You'll match me.
I'll shake your hand for that.
Thank you very much.
- Yes, you're welcome.
- All right.
- Jeez, ten grand.
- You're the one...
Your stock went up
$3 billion last year.
I got ten grand out of you.
MOORE:
Hey, it's something, right?
And I know what
most of you are thinking...
"I sure would've liked
to have seen that footrace."
Well, maybe next movie.
Meanwhile, back in my neck
of the woods in the Midwest...
there was
some pretty good news.
The people at the Borders
in Des Moines...
had voted in the union.
Yes! Yes!
[Laughing]
It's sort of stunning after
you do something for so long.
It's sort of hard...
to all of a sudden
start thinking any other way.
But tomorrow morning...
We'll probably all sleep
the sleep of the dead tonight.
That'll be great.
MOORE: And in
suburban Philadelphia...
We just got the word.
The final vote was 26-20.
We got a union.
[Laughing, whooping]
There you go.
Swell my chest to full size.
I'm gonna run over to ACME
and let someone over there know.
OK.
MOORE: The Borders workers
were so happy...
their first thought
was to run across the street...
to tell the grocery store
baggers the good news.
It kind of gave me
a good feeling...
them realizing everyone was
sort of in the same boat...
and if things
are gonna get better...
it's gonna happen right here.
These companies...
big business, right?
They had us talking that talk
for so long...
free enterprise,
free market, capitalism...
when they were the last ones
to believe in it.
It's all so weird, isn't it?
Now we're at a point
in our history...
where we have one candidate,
one party, one company.
[Audience laughing]
I like to say...
one evil empire down,
one to go.
[Audience clapping]
* I've traveled every road

I've been everywhere, man *

Did you hear the story
about last night...
Turn it off now. The story
last night in the hotel?
About the naked man?
* I've been everywhere, man
I've been everywhere, man *
I look out the peephole,
and there is a stark naked man...
I mean, butt naked, nothing on,
banging on my door.
And the first thought
that goes through my head is...
"This is how
it's all going to end."
[Audience laughing]
General Motors has sent
a naked man.
They don't
even have the decency...
to send the assassin
with clothes on.
* I've been everywhere, man *
* Across

* I've breathed

If 12-year-olds are working
in these factories...
that's OK with you?
There are not 12-year-olds
working in the factory.
- How old?
- Minimum age is 14.
How about 14, then?
Doesn't that bother you?
No.

WOMAN: You should
run for president.
It would send a message.
What would be the message?
"Eat out more often"? Jeez.
No. I'm a bad example.

I don't give a fuck about

You say, "the poor little
Indonesian workers."
Come back in five years...
one of them will
probably be your landlord.
What does that mean?
* I've been everywhere, man *
* Across
the deserts bare, man *
* I breathe
the mountain air, man *
* Of travel
I've had my share, man *
Yeah. You're pointing right
to your uvula, basically.
Mm-hmm. I thought guys
didn't have those.
* I've been everywhere *
No, I think you're wasting
batteries, actually.
I mean, and David with
his only one battery...
Brian, will you back off?
You seem really upset.
Well, I can't shoot.
I don't have a battery.
Just relax. The batteries
are charging upstairs.
So we need... What else
do you need, a tripod?
I really want this
to have a happy ending.
I really wanted you to,
at the end of the film, say...
"I'm a little different...
"than what's going on here
in corporate America.
"I care about the fact
that Americans need jobs.
"I care about the fact...
"that Indonesians
need a livable wage...
"and that kids shouldn't be
working in these factories...
"and that I'm going to be
a man of conscience...
"and a leader
and do something about it."
That's the ending
I wanted for this movie.
That's what I really
was hoping for here.
And...
And I'm waiting
for the ending of the film.
