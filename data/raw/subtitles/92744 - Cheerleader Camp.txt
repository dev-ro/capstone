We're waiting...
We're waiting...
We're waiting...
Finally...
Waiting...
Why?  For what?
For this?
Lean to the left.
Lean to the right.
Stand up!  Sit down!
That's not right.
Mum?
Dad?  
Father?
Somebody?
I need love!
Please...
Somebody?!
Go, go!
Fight, fight!  
Who's going to win tonight?
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
Go, go!  Fight, fight!
Who's going to win tonight?
(Screaming)
Hey, great scream!
What a dream, eh?
Yeah, lot of laughs!
What did you see that 
was so scary?
If you only knew, darling!
I wonder what part of 
Brent made you scream?
Keep your fantasies 
to yourself, Pamela.
Trouser trout attacks cheerleader...
Filmed at eleven!
Hey, censorship!
You okay?
I guess.
Change of scenery might help.
(Bonnie singing along to mucic)
Hey, relax.
We're all feeling the pressure.
We win this weekend,
we go on to the state finals.
We don't, we're nobodies.
You really believe that?
You don't?
Yeah, sure I do.
I guess.
We're going to bag this contest.
Yeah, well, I just 
want to get laid.
Timmy, you wouldn't know what to do with 
it if it walked up and bit you on the nose!
Oh, thank you for the 
vote of confidence!
Hey, this is it!
And there's our competition.
Yeah, check out the contenders!
We've got to win today, you guys!
I hate to think about going back...
Well, there's no going back!
I've got some of those weenies!
Here, get this for our 
future generations.
I'm stuck.
Hey, Brent.  
I'm stuck!
- Hi, we're...uh...
- Late!
Roll call!
Brent Hoover.
All-district yell leader.
Got it.
A simple "Present" will suffice.
(Farting)
Bonnie Reed!
A simple present!
Yes, dear.
The lights are on, 
but the bulbs are dim.
Timothy Moser!
Yeah, here!
A fact you've made
abundantly clear.
Theresa Salazar?
I've arrived!
We'll see.
Pamela Bently?
Present, Mrs...
It's Miss Tipton.
And if you want to kiss 
up to me, feel free.
Won't do you much good, but...
I do deserve that 
sort of treatment.
Alison Wenthworth?
Oh, here, Miss Tiptis!
It's Tipton.
And I'm here to make your 
stay at Camp Hurrah...
not merely the most memorable 
experience of your young lives...
but also your virginal plunge...
into the icy hot sea 
of living tradition!
Now, if you'll...
all gather your bags...
Cory Foster.
You haven't called me.
Team mascot.
Yes, of course.
Tough competition!
She looks like the one to beat
if you want to be queen.
And the one to beat up...
if you want to keep your man!
That's okay.  
I'm Pop.
Handyman.
I gotta help out around here.
You look a little piqued.
Why don't I take your stuff,
and we'll see if we can catch up 
with the rest of them, OK?
(Coughs and snorts)
Jeez, I hope he doesn't 
aim that at the food!
So you've heard a few 
lines, have you?
Including that one.
I still think you're beautiful.
And your eyes tell me 
to come over here.
Well, my lips 
tell you to go!
- Tacky.
- Where?  Which one?
That one.
That one.
And that one.
What about your stuff?
Yeah, bastard queen!
That's right! 
Queen!
Because I'm going to win 
that queen contest!
What about Alison?
She won't last.
Between her bad dreams and 
Brent's so hot to trot.
It's just you and me.
You don't mind, do you?
No, Cory.
Why would I mind?
Well, I am just 
the mascot.
You make it sound 
like a disease!
Well, it's what everyone wants, I'm sure - 
when it comes to my personality.
Come on, Cory.
Put your stuff down.
You and I are roomies.
I'm not like you, Alison.
You've got everything.
Everything?
Tell me about it.  Everything weird.
Growing up was 
so much fun.
There is something eating 
at you, isn't there?
There's something eating 
at everybody, right?
Come on.
Let's get ready to go swimming!
No girl shuts me 
down like that.
- Dog meat.
- No, she's a babe.
Talking about you!
What about you 
and that blonde?
Nah, I don't think 
she likes me.
You know, Timmy, you've just got
 to learn to express yourself more.
You're just too shy.
Hey, how about I do some 
research on the ladies?
Like I said, pal - 
just too shy.
No....Wow.
Do you guys really 
think she's that hot?
I think I see 
chicken skin!
Chicken? 
Where?
Oh, would you look at 
the lungs on that girl!
She looks like she could 
be the camp queen!
No way!
That's for sure.
Right, Alison?
I don't know.
Well, I do!
Well, Alison?
You know, Pamela, if you don't quit worrying 
about the queen contest, you're going to get wrinkles!
La-de-da-da.
(Sneezes)
Oh, relax, it's okay...
I'm just trying to commune with nature.
Isn't it lovely - 
the sights you see?
Have fun.
Don't mind me.
I'm just in search of a 
"red-tailed breast thruster!"
Maybe you'll find what 
you're looking for...
Here!
Well, here you are, 
here we are...
Now, big boy, what're 
you going to do?
Your moment of glory.
You look great!
Excuse me -
exit stage right!
Bird watching, Sheriff?
Shit!
You know, you keep using those 
things on your peepers that way...
you're going to end up cross-eyed.
- Line of duty, pal.
- Line of duty, my ass!
Line of dirty more like it!
Who the hell let you out
of your cage, anyway?
Okay, big star.  
Hold it!  Good smile!
Great try!
Excellent chair!
Now, let's see a "T" roll down.
(Voices overlapping)
Tough competition!
She looks like the one to beat.
The one to beat up if you want
to keep your man.
Excuse me.
Can I come in?
Look, this is no place for you people.
Now, everybody out.  Scoot!
Will you hurry up for 
Pete's sake?
You get off my back.  
I'm taking care of it, okay?
May I have your 
attention, please?
How about a hug?
  Attention.  
Attention!
I'd like to talk about...
the tragedy that happened today.
Why suicide?
Success can bring it.
Too much...
too little...not having it all.
Even though Suzy had 
everything to live for...
Personal demons 
terrorised her soul.
Personal demons?
There are unfortunately...
those few of us who 
are too unstable.
Don't let this child's unfortunate 
choice dampen your...
own spirits.
Be strong, my pretties,
and sleep tight!
You guys really think 
it was suicide?
What else?
I don't know.
If you were a cop, wouldn't you
suspect something strange?
Who?
Dee-Dee?
That smelly old coot that 
doesn't say anything?
I don't know.
You know that other 
guy who works here?
He gives me the creeps.
I bet he'd like to give
you more than that!
Oh, you're going to love this!
Come here!
I can't watch this, man.
There's Suzy.
Why'd she kill herself?
Was it something I said?
Yeah, you drove her to it, just like
every other girl you ever met.
They all want to commit suicide.
Like the Fangouli sisters -
when we were in high school.
Hey, I loved both of them.
You know that!
Oh, yeah.  
Sure you did.
Cheer up, lighten up.
Come on, we're looking 
at naked women here!
Never thought she was going to...
Suicide?
Yeah, I don't mean that I would ever 
try it or anything like that, but...
sometimes, in my mind...
in the dark side, 
I think of it.
Everybody does.
Don't tell me 
everybody does.
But, you...
You're pretty, popular,
you've got a great boyfriend.
Others are prettier,
and prettiness is just a good accident.
I don't know how many real friends
I have, but way less than popular.
And the greatness of my 
boyfriend is debatable.
Ali, you're one of the best
cheerleaders in the state.
No big deal, Cory.
Others are better.
They don't have 
what you have.
Lucky for them!
It's class, Alison...and you
shouldn't doubt yourself.
Who says I doubt myself?
You brush it like that,
and you're going to be bald.
Oh, Cory, it's just that I get sick 
of this whole mess, you know?
You're either in it or out.
A winner or a loser.
Always on stage,
always being perfect.
Sometimes, I just 
want to be myself.
Whatever that is.
Well, you're here now...
so might as well try to 
be happy and enjoy this.
Sometimes it's hard to enjoy stuff.
So you try harder.
Yeah, yeah, you're right!
Thanks, Cory.
Sure.
You know, Brent was 
with that girl today.
- You weren't jealous, were you?
- Why?
Just that you shouldn't feel funny 
about what happened, that's all.
Night.
God, no...
Make it stop!
(Rapping)
You start with Alison, and she's so fine!
Don't look at her long
or you'll go blind!
Next is Pam,
she comes out with a bam!
And we'll tell you this -
she ain't no sham!
Next is Bonnie,
she acts kind of funny!
She'll steal your heart,
but not your money!
Be careful of Theresa,
she's got what it takes!
Putting her on the team
was no mistake!
Last is Cory.
This is her story!
She's our gator.
You'll be seeing her later!
And we're Brent and Timmy,
we're part of the bunch!
Going to take the crown,
and that ain't no hunch!
Now, get ready to hear
our cheer!
'Cause we're the best team
you'll see this year!  Bola!
Dammit!
This is impossible!
I'll eat like a human!
You're a mascot.
Not a human.
So, I suggest you get with
the spirit,
and put the head 
back on!
You try it!
And I'll drop dead if you've
ever tried head.
Well, I suggest you find a soft 
spot to land, little lizard.
Carry on!
Come on, I want to show 
you another cheer.
Here we go!
Lindo Valley Gator!
Doing better, huh?
We're trying harder.
How're you doing?
Okay.
You know, one minute you're one way, 
the next minute you're another.  I can't figure you out.
I can't figure myself out either.
Do you have service?
That's right, Sheriff!
Please hurry!
Oh, honey, you know we've got a phone up at the office you're 
welcome to use.  You don't have to run all the way up here.
So, what the hell were you 
going to do, Miss Tipton?
Serve her for tonight's stew?
Unreported suicide.
What did you think?
That she was just going to go away?
You have caused a 
lot of trouble.
That girl died and 
you've done nothing about it!
You did the right thing
by calling me, young lady.
But I'll take care of it
from here.
Ronnie, would you mind handing
me my screwdriver?
It's a little hard to concentrate on my work
with this place full of this gaggle of gumbeaters.
Look, can we discuss this
in my office, please?
Damn right we can.
Don, I was going to tell you about 
this as soon as this group finished.
What were you going 
to do, Dee-Dee?
Put her on ice for 3 days?
I knew once you came out on this,
you'd want to close down the camp!
And with the owners...they're 
coming down at lunch time.
Don, I need this job!
Dee-Dee, don't 
worry about a thing.
Everything's going to be okay.
It will?
Yeah.
Mad Dog's here.
Well, I'm going to slip into
something more comfortable.
And make you something to drink.  
I'll be right back.
Ta-da!  Time to
be a hero, Mad Dog!
The Pirates line up...
The Kooters have the ball 
in the 22.
16 seconds to go...
Thunder crashes in 
the background!
More, more.
We want more!
Mad Dog is an animal!
There's no stopping him now!
You can do it, you can do it,
you can do it!
Mad Dog goes after the ball...
He jumps, he tends to 
jump early...
He's got the ball...
Oh!
No stopping him when he gets
up a head of steam!
Come on, Mad Dog!
Come on!
He's coming down the field...
Straight arming!
Passing the ball!
He sees the goalpost 
looking at him!
He gets to the 50...
40...
Holy shit!
- 20...
- You can do it!
Closer...
He's going to score!
Oh, yeah!
What?  Come on, 
go for the extra point!
I think I just made my
first full-length porno.
- What?
- Nothing.
You know, you're going to 
go to hell for lying like that.
This here is going to 
get me to heaven.
If God didn't want me to do this,
he wouldn't have made washcloths.
Or teeny-weenys.
Hey, hey, this is not to make it look bigger.
This is to protect it.
- Ah, yeah, sure it is.
- Get out of here, you...
Watch your eyes, buster!
Don't worry, I'm not looking up!
I am worried.
Why aren't you?
- Excuse me, girls.
- It's tropical cream.
Looks more like the floor of the 
movie theater on Saturday night.
Is that good?
Five o'clock shadow?
Aren't we the 
mature one?!
And you look like a walking
felony in that thing!
Well, if you don't look 
good, it ain't worth it.
Hi.  
Lovely day for a stroll.
You could stroll right out of here
except the nearest town...
is 1000 miles away.
Besides, we can't go.
We've got a contest to win, remember.
Now, you're talking about winning?
Are you really sure that's what you want?
I wish I could be more certain.
Is it for me or or for the people who're 
telling me what I should be doing?
You know what's scary?
We're going to be out in the real
world soon.
Who do you win for out there?
We've got to be sure that what we're 
doing is what we want to be doing.
But, before we figure out who wants what...
a person...could go crazy.
Well, there's more than 
one way to be a winner.
I think that has to do with the 
friends you meet along the way.
Right, friend?
You really mean that?
I'm sure about it.
That's nice.
Another way of winning is for 
you to bag that mascot title.
We here at
Camp Hurrah...
instil pride, confidence and 
a glow of dignity...
that only cheerleading
can bring.
I would like you to see some
of the professional performances...
that have helped me...
to feel the spirit!
(All chanting)
Feel the spirit!
(Chanting continues)
Feel the spirit!
Feel the spirit!
Turn it off!
(Chanting)
Feel the spirit!
Would you turn it off?!
Not now, Dee-Dee.
We're at half-time.
Feel the spirit!
Feel the spirit!
Oh, my God!
You slay me!  Absolutely slay me!
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure, what?
Ever since we got here, you've 
been flirting with a lot of other girls.
That's not true.
You're supposed to be my boyfriend,
but you haven't been acting like it lately.
Even Pam is starting to get
ideas about you.
How's that?
Liked it.
Why don't we go someplace
where we can get more comfortable?
I don't think tonight's 
a very good night.
Ever since we've been here,
it's never been a good night.
I haven't been feeling well lately.
Can't you understand that?
No, I can't understand it.
I miss being with you.
Obviously, you haven't missed me that much or 
you wouldn't have tried to make me feel jealous.
What have I been doing?
Treating me like dirt.
Yeah, why don't we talk when 
you're feeling better, huh?
Fine.
You know, I'm 
worried about Alison.
She's been a little 
off since the ride up.
Since before that!
Maybe she could 
use a little attention.
Yeah, well, so could I.
- Goodnight, man.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight, Alison.
Goodnight, Cory.
(All cheering)
Hard, hard!  Do it, do it!
Hard, hard!
Do it, do it!
Do it again!  
Do it again!  Do it again!
Harder!  Harder!
Harder!
Ready?  Okay!
Lindo Valley Gator
are the best!
We're the team that's 
ahead of the rest!
You watch us rock 'em
with all our might!
We don't give up without 
a fight, fight, fight!
Clumsy!
What are you doing in that spot?
You're supposed to be there!
Come on, you guys.
We can do better than this!
What do you mean 
"we" - mascot?
- Lay off of Cory...
- It figures you'd say that.
Listen, dammit...
- That's enough, Alison...
- Me?
It's a lousy way to 
start the big day.
Let's try it again, okay?
Why?
It just keeps getting worse.
I don't know about you people...
but if I don't take a break,
I'm going to flip out!
Cut it out!
You touch me again and your 
voice will never be the same!
I was just playing tag!
- Tag, my ass.
- Okay!
- Where're you going?
- Somewhere else.
Alison, wait!
Hey, why don't we go someplace
and get some sun?
Okay.
- No.
- What?
I don't want this to 
be a one-time thing.
I mean, do you 
really care for me?
But you flirt around like a butterfly,
and now you're all talk.  Is that it?
Maybe I am.
Maybe I'm not!
But you don't want to break
the string now.  Is that it?
Shhhh!
I hear something.
What now?
  Shhhh!  Really!
I've had about enough 
of this bullshit!
Brent, Brent, wait!
Brent?
Brent?
Where are you?
Brent?
(Alison screaming)
It's me, Cory!
Talk about a bad dream!
It's almost competition time.
Are you going to be ready for it?
- No more pills, Alison!
- It's none of your business, Cory.
Maybe not, but you've
got problems,
and you can talk about them
to your friend.
I don't have any friends!
But I'm still your friend.
I mean, I'd like to be.
If you don't want to 
talk about it, it's okay.
Now you better get dressed or
we're going to be late.
- Cory, thanks.
- Well, we're in this thing together, so...
Pam's not here.
Even if I was with Brent and 
wanted to...
take my own sweet time -
tonight is competition night!
You know, I think we'd all be better off if 
she thought more about the team,
and less about getting honey
on her muffin.
Honey on her muffin?
- Honey on her muffin?!
- Well, yeah.
It isn't like her.
She should be here.
Yeah!
Yeah, Cory!  Yeah!
I've seen something 
like this before.
Yeah, in a bad dream!
God, Alison I'm sorry to be talking 
about your dreams like that.
Well, you might be right.
With your looks, you have no 
worries about the queen contest.
Pam should be here 
by now.
Don't worry.  That little tease is not
going to miss your big day.
- What did you do to her?
- I told you - nothing!
What did you try 
to do to her?
Let's hear it for the turkey...
the chicken...
and the gator.
And the winner is...
the chicken!
Good job, Cory!
I should have won.
Miss Tipton had this 
whole thing rigged!
It's only mascots, Cory!
Got more important
things to worry about!
Like, where's Pam?
Let's get something 
to drink.
If she shows, I'm 
going to kill her!
What's the matter
with you, Alison?
This afternoon, 
what did I do?
Slept - didn't have 
a bad dream.
Why hasn't Pam shown up?
I don't know, Alison.
And now...
Let the contest begin!
That one with the jugs 
in the orange skirt...
would make your pee-pee harder than a 
ten-pound bag of nickel jawbreakers!
One of these days that bitch
is going to push me too far!
Did you and Pam 
do something?
You always think the
worst, don't you?
No I don't, Brent.
Are you jealous or did you
just have another bad dream?
Look, I don't care if
you kissed her...or screwed.
Pam could be hurt!
She might be dead.
Lindo Valley group in line!
If you can...
You're up next!
Well, don't we look like 
a bunch of winners?
You mean weenies.
Look, there's no way we can do this 
kind of position with one of us missing.
No way, you guys - I once read
this story...
about this choo-choo train,
and if we think we can...
and if we think we can,
well we can!
Yeah, sure, right!
I don't know.
Maybe she's right!
Maybe we can pull this 
together without Pam.
Maybe we can find the guts deep
within, inside of us...
to pull us through to victory.
What do you say?  Victory!
Go, Alison!
Sorry, Pop!
   Laugh, dammit!  
You can't sing!
I hope you die!
You guys.
Oh, God!
I tripped over the old geek!
At least we tried!
Two minutes to the
queen contest.
The winner will compete for
Miss Cheerleader USA.
So, girls - 
think royal thoughts!
Right, girls.  At least we should
get the queen contest.
We can save some face.
One of you girls going to win this for us?
This is not a camp 
for clowns!
I want explanations!
One of our team members is missing -
we tried a new routine.
Well, where is she?
Yeah, Brent.
What's the scoop, dude?
Alright, guys.  I went swimming with Pam.
I left - that's the last time I saw her, OK?
You left her alone?
OK, it wasn't a bright move.
She probably just got lost.
She'll be here soon.
Look, I don't have time for this!
Alright, girls.  Let's keep this together.
Just save some face, huh?
Going to win this 
for me, huh?
Let's go.
Okay, Theresa, let's go!
How can we think about a stupid 
contest when Pam's not even here?
Maybe she'll show 
up just in time.
She'll show up, she'll show up!
We keep saying that, mascot!
She hasn't shown up!
My, don't we have our
undies in a bunch?
Come on, girls. 
Don't be shy!
Come on.
Come on.
The Queen will epitomise...
the highest ideals of 
cheerleading...
which are nothing less than the
highest ideals of mankind.
She will be judged on poise, 
enthusiasm, spirit...
and, of course, 
her smile!
Going to be a tough 
choice this year.
It fills me with pleasure...
to present this year's
Hurrah Queen...
from the Lindo Valley group!
What is your name, dear?
- Alison.
- (Silently) What?
Bonnie Reed.
Bonnie Reed.
Way to go, Bonnie!
That was awesome!
What's the matter?
The contest didn't mean anything to you.
To you it did.
Winning means a lot to me.
Maybe it should mean 
more to you.
You know, you stop playing with 
your head, you could be somebody!
Brent, stop it!
Don't do this now.
What?
Nothing.
Can you see Theresa?
Timmy, hang 
with the girls.
Tough job!
Well, dear, Bonnie won!
It should have been you, Alison.
Lindo Valley?
Where is the rest of your group?
Searching.  Now two 
of us are missing.
Keep an eye on them.
Dee-Dee, I am aware.
- And, Pop - just an eye!
- I'll handle it.
I always do.
Pam?
Theresa?
Christ, I can hear you.
Pam?
Pam, where are you?
Now, where did I put that
son of a bitch?
Keep an eye on 'em!
All those pretty young things
running around with all that flesh...
hanging out everywhere.  Keep an eye 
on 'em!  You can bet your bloomers on it.
Who's there?
Pam, is that you?
Oh, God!
Let it be you.
Pam, thank God,
you're safe!
You missed the contest,
but it doesn't matter.
I was so afraid!
My best friend gone!
I didn't know what 
happened to you.
Pam?
Come on. 
Wake up.
Pam, come on!
Wake up!
Stop fooling around!
Time to rise and shine!
I wish our 
gang was here.
Oh, they'll be back - even with Pam.
No worries.
Alison, Alison, it's OK!
Did you find Pam?
She's still lost.  We'll never
find her in the dark.  Let's head back.
What if she's dead?
She's not dead!
You don't know that.
We'll look for her in the light
tomorrow, OK?
- Call the sheriff!
- And what's he going to do?
Find her!
Alison, Brent.
Have you found Pam?
- Well, what about Theresa?
- We don't know.
I thought she was
with you, Brent.
No, she wasn't, OK.
Well now, what've we got here?
Cockroach convention on parade?
I wish you kid'd go back to the party. 
You're cutting into my drinking time.
- Did you find Pam?
- You don't see her, do you?
Where's Theresa?
Somewhere out dancing
with the elves.
What do I look like?
One of them new fangled computers?
She probably went back to 
camp where she belongs!
Where you better be going right now.  
Now, scoot!  Get out of here!
- I don't know about that guy.  
- Why?
When we went swimming, 
I thought he followed us there.
Do you think he did
anything to Pam?
I don't know.
He's probably harmless.
We don't know that.
And Theresa is still out
here somewhere.
Look, she's probably back at the party 
dancing with a line of salivating males, OK?
Now, come on!
I've never been real good at....
Oh, what the fuck?
Not bad!
Excuse me.
They didn't show?
- No Pam, no Theresa?
- We've got to talk to you.
Maybe later.
Maybe never!
Now!
- Two of our girls are missing.
- You've got to do something!
I am doing something!
What's that?
Dancing while our girls disappear?
- She can't function.
- I'm calling the sheriff!
- Not a good idea!
- Come on, Brent!
Look, the sheriff shows up,
Pam's still lost...
I become a prime 
suspect for murder!
What if Pam is dead?
And what about Theresa?
Maybe that Suzy 
wasn't a suicide?!
And there is a killer who 
might still be out there!
Maybe it was Dee-Dee 
and the weird handyman?
- Maybe it was me!
- You?!
I don't know anymore!
Look, you're talking crazy.
Everyone is going to show up 
and everything will be fine.
Alright, now, just come on.
Brent.
I need help.
Are you okay?
Fine, I'll find the kids!
I don't see you.
Maybe not - no.
Now, where is that...
Fuck!
(Singing)
Sheriff Poucher,  Sheriff Poucher.
Come in, please.
Poucher, where 
are you?
Sorry to bother you, sir, but
we got a call from Camp Hurrah.
What's wrong with Dee-Dee...
um...Miss Tipton, now?
It wasn't her that called.
It was one of the kids.
Reported missing persons.
Missing persons 
- my arse!
A bunch of kids out humping 
in the woods - that's what it is.
Alright, tell them I'm on my way.
Over.
- Timmy, that's not funny!
- That's disgusting!
It was that blonde -
out here alone.
I came to the tree 
and there she was!
Come on, let's 
get out of here.
No more surprises, 
okay?
Let the others 
stay alive!
Who is it?
Who is it?
Oh, it's you!
Well, look, did you find out anything 
about our girls, because if you didn't...
Miss Tipton, you've had way 
too much to drink.
I don't think you're 
  in any condition to...
Miss Tipton?
What's the matter?
Oh!
I had a nightmare!
This is not a 
nightmare, Alison.
Try to calm down.
Put that down.
Is this real?
Yes.
You don't think I
was the one...
Of course not, Alison.
Everybody, listen up
Stay calm.
But one of our girls has
been murdered!
Just get out of here alive!
Don't panic.
Where are
Cory and Alison?
I don't know.  
Damn!
Wait here.
I'll look for them.
Alright, hurry up.
I want to get out of here.
Alison?
Cory?!
Alison?!
Jesus Christ.
There you are!
We've got to get out of here!
There's a killer around!
Come on you guys!
Hurry!
Let's go!
Why didn't you warm 
up the van?
How?  By sitting on it?
You have the keys!
I thougnt you fixed
this thing?!
What do you expect?
Miracles?
Stop it!
Just stop it!
Hood!
Blown!
Someone doesn't want us
to leave this place.
You know, I kind of get the feeling that 
this is the prize for coming last place.
We've got to 
walk out of here.
It's at least 40 miles.
You've got 
a better idea?
- What about the killer?
- We can't stay here.
You know, I'm starting to 
feel like the little kid at camp.
I want to go home, 
and I want my mum!
I want my mum too!
That's settled then.
Let's go!
We're not safe here.
We're not safe back there either.
The bastard could be anywhere.
Are you sure about 
that handyman?
He's a geek, but, Christ, 
geeks don't kill you.
Oh, the way he's looking
at us girls...
like he wanted to undress 
us with his eyes!
Here's your "man in the street"
in the "forest area." 
Excuse me, just where were
you when all the killing began...
and how did you get those
bloodstains on your clothes?
- Stop it.
- Don't.
Put that thing away.
No, I can use it to 
lighten up a little bit.
I don't know about you guys, but 
I'm going a little cuckoo here.
Do you hear something?
Yeah, something.
Alright, your girls 
are dead.
Go on back now!
Go!
Come on, you idiot!
This isn't a game!
No, don't stop.
Go on.  
I'll catch up with you.
Go ahead.
What an angle!
Just so I'll remember the lovely
time I had here at Camp Hurrah.
Boy, it sure is peaceful 
out here in nature...
So quiet you can hear 
yourself think.
You could hear yourself
do other things.
A monster is stirring...
It needs to get out!
It needs relief!
Why did you run 
off like that?
Oh my God, there's 
too much going on!
You've got to keep your head!
I've got to be able to trust you!
Look at me, guys.  Look at me.  
Don't I make a beautiful queen?
It's okay!
Are you alright?
- What happened?
- Are you alright?
I don't know...
Someone tried to grab me!
I got away!
Where's Timmy?
- He's taking pictures.
- That's crazy!
What's he going to do?
Sell the video?
Alright, you guys stay here.
I'll go get him.
You guys, I don't think Brent
is handling this well.
I've never seen him
acting so weird.
He's doing better than some
of us - me, for instance.
That gardener guy!
He said he 
had our girl...
I mean that 
must be Pam.
He killed her.
Like he did Theresa...
and Tipton...
and probably that 
suicide girl.
Why didn't he shoot us?
He could have!
He just fired up into the air!
Well, someone tried 
to kill me!
All I found was
the camera.
Why is he joking
around now?
Look, maybe we 
should watch this!
Maybe there's 
something on it!
I hear something stirring...
and I think it's going to 
need a little relief.
I'll get that bastard!
Secure that door,
so he won't come in this way.
Almost ready!
Got you, you bastard!
Thank God it's over!
Oh no.
Brent, what have you done?
You're dog meat, boy!
(Two shots)
You had the axe.
He had the gun.
I had to do it, Brent.
I was afraid for you.
Afraid for me?
I had him right where 
I wanted him!
You saved my 
life, Cory!
Hold me, Brent!
It's okay.
It's okay.
No.
Stop.
Dreams...Nightmares...
Don't do this to yourself!
Stop it!
It's all over!
Everything is alright.
That's okay.
That's okay.
Cory, you saved 
my life tonight!
And, Bonnie, you're
still the queen!
Kiss, kiss.
Let's get out of here!
Why don't you go and 
try calling again?
Tell him what happened.
I'll be quick.
Cory, why don't you go with her and 
make sure she's not too quick, huh?
Brent, you're drunk.
I'm happy!
Don't be crazy.
I'm crazy for you!
Brent, stop it.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
We're alive!
Not here, not now.
Do you know a better 
way to celebrate?
Stop it.
You're hurting me.
- Brent.
- What?
I can't find Bonnie.
I never should have
left you alone with him.
What are you 
talking about?
Don't you see, Alison?
He was just 
attacking you!
Now I know he was the one out 
there who was trying to kill me!
No, Cory.
That's not true!
I wish it wasn't!
I really like Brent,
but we've got to stop him...
before he kills Bonnie!
Cory, that's insane.
What are you talking about?
The killer is Brent!
Here!
And we've got to stick together on this!
It's the only way we get to get out of this alive!
I don't want to kill...
He's right around 
the corner.
- How do you know?
- Listen.
We've got to have 
the gun ready.
Now, we don't know 
what he's going to do.
So you've got to be
ready for anything.
Alright, we're going to go on 3.
Ready?
One...two...
- Ali, he's the killer!
- No!
Found two more
in the bushes.
She surrendered her weapon, 
but she's still really agitated.
I've seen psychos 
in my day!
What would make a kid
do something like this?
Wanting to be number one.
Wanting and not getting.
Don't touch me.
I'm not ready yet.
You feeling alright?
I'm still a little bit shaky,
but I'll be okay.
I'm really glad
it's all over.
We need a statement.
What's going to 
happen to Alison?
Well, with your testimony,
she'll be charged with...
the murders.
- Prison?
- Maybe.
Maybe a mental ward.
She seemed so perfect!
Just wasn't strong enough.
She really didn't know 
what she wanted.
I hope she gets
all the help she needs!
You kept calling the
sheriff all weekend.
You trying to throw suspicion off
yourself or did you really want to get caught?
What are you 
talking about?
Why did you kill
all those people?
No, I killed Brent.
He was the killer...
I only had dreams...
Dreams!
Some dreams!
Who told you
I killed everyone?
Give me a "C"!
No!
Give me an "O"!
She knows better!
Give me an "R"!
Why did I ever 
trust Cory?
- Give me a "Y"!
- She killed them all!
Sure she did.
Who do we love?
Cory!
Who do we love?
Cory!
Cory!
