Well, young ladies,
we are indeed fortunate in the weather

I have instructed Mademoiselle
that as the day is likely to be warm,
you may remove your gloves
once the drag has passed through Woodend.
You will partake of luncheon
at the picnic grounds near the rock.
Once again let me remind you that
the rock itself is extremely dangerous
and you are therefore forbidden any tomboy
foolishness in the matter of exploration,
even on the lower slopes.
I also wish to remind you the vicinity
is renowned for its venomous snakes
and poisonous ants of various species.
It is, however, a geological marvel,
on which you will be required to write
a brief essay on Monday morning.
That is all.
Have a pleasant day,
and try to behave yourselves
in a manner to bring credit
to the college.

I shall expect you back, Miss McCraw
and Mademoiselle, at about eight

Good, good.
As if looking up. Right up.
That's it. Looking for a cave

Little more expression in the face, sir.

Hello, Irma.
Madame Fitzhubert showed me in.
How do you feel?
Oh, Irma! Oh, Irma.
We thought you had gone for ever.
Let me look at you, chérie.
You are so pale
but prettier than ever.
Has the nephew paid you a visit yet?
The one who found you?
Yes.
And then the policeman.
And you couldn't...
I, I remember...
...nothing.
Nothing! I remember nothing!

Morning.
Send that reporter packing.
Girls, girls, get inside at once!
(WHISPER) There you are,
Miranda dear.
You like these best.
Mr Whitehead gave them to me,
to give to you.
My dear...
...my sweet Miranda.
She likes daisies best of all.
Oh, Sara! Oh, Sara!
You do know that Miranda
might not come back.
Miranda knows lots of things
other people don't know.
Secrets.
She knew she wouldn't come back.

Fanny, you are ridiculously out of step.
Pay attention to the music, please!
Excuse me, Miss Lumley.
Voilà, mes enfants!
See who we have with us today?
Our dear Irma is with us

She is leaving soon

Alors, mes enfants. For ten minutes,

My notice, ma'am.
Have we an invalid in the house?
Miss Sara's supper, ma'am.
Mademoiselle asked me,

Oh.
Minnie.
Hmm?
Kindly tell Miss Sara not to put her light
out until I've had a word with her.
Yes, ma'am.
(WHISPERS) This is not
a charitable institution.
You recall our recent discussion, Sara.
Answer me when I address you, child.
Yes.
I have considered your situation
most carefully,
and I have searched my mind and
my conscience for a solution.
But this is not a charitable institution.
And as your fees have not been
forthcoming, I have...
...been forced to make certain
arrangements on your behalf.
You will be returned to the orphanage.

You still thinking about that bloody rock?
I can't help it.
It comes back at night in dreams.
I had a funny dream last night.
There was this smell. Real strong.
It was like... like I was wide awake.
Dead quiet.
Pansies. That's what it smelt like.
And the whole place was all lit up,
bright as day.
Pitch black outside.
And there she is.
Who?
Who was it?
It was only a bloody dream!
My kid sister.
Haven't seen her since the orphanage.
She always liked pansies.
And she went... all sort of...
...misty-like.
I calls out,
'Sara, don't go yet.'
'Goodbye, Bertie, ' she says.
'I've come a long way to see ya,
and now I must go.'
And she went.
Clear through that wall over there.
- Sit down, please, Mademoiselle.
- Merci.
We were speaking last night
about the Waybourne girl.
You expressed concern over
the state of her health.
Yes, Madame.
We have been relieved of
any further responsibility.
Her guardian, Mr Cosgrove, arrived
this morning and took her away with him.
But...
But was she fit enough to travel?
Apparently.
I should have been here
to supervise her packing.
I, myself, helped Sara put a few things
she especially wanted
into her little covered basket.
Mr Cosgrove was in a hurry to get away.
I shall not be coming
into luncheon, Mademoiselle.
Kindly tell them not to lay
a place for me.
Nor for Sara?
Nor for Sara.
Is that rouge I see on your cheek,
Mademoiselle?
Powder, Madame. I find it becoming.

Au revoir!
Arthur, my late husband, and I,
always took our annual holidays
in Bournemouth.
Mmm. it's a delightful place.
Absolutely delightful.
Nothing changed. Ever.
For 40 years.
The pier, the sands and the people.
And that guest house. So dependable.
Completely and utterly dependable.
A little more, Mam'selle?
No, Madame.
As you wish.

I came to depend so much
on Greta McCraw.
So much masculine intellect.
I came to rely on that woman. Trust her.
How could she allow herself
to be spirited away?
Lost.
Raped.
Murdered in cold blood
like a silly schoolgirl on that...

Will Sara Waybourne be coming back
this term, Madame?
Oh! Now where was I?
Oh, yes! Bournemouth.
What a delightful place!

The body of Mrs Arthur Appleyard,
principal of Appleyard College,
was found at the base of Hanging Rock
on Friday 27th March, 1900.
Although the exact circumstances
of her death are not known,
it is believed she fell while
attempting to climb the rock.
A search for the missing schoolgirls
and their governess
continued spasmodically for
the next few years without success.
To this day, their disappearance
remains a mystery.
