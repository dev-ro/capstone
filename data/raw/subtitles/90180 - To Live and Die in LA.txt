(Ronald Reagan) I believe
that in both spirit and substance,
our tax system
has come to be un-American.
Death and taxes may be inevitable,
but unjust taxes are not.
The first American revolution
was sparked by a conviction -
taxation without representation is tyranny.
Two centuries later...
(knocking)
- You're pushed.
- We had a game going.
- What kind of stakes?
- Five and ten.
- Is the man gonna play?
- After the speech.
- Outstanding.
- (clattering)
(door opens and closes)
Post three? I got a shake.
Right there, fella!
I'm ready to die.
Nobody's gonna die. Look... you and I
are gonna go downstairs and talk.
Death to Israel and America
and all the enemies of Islam!
I understand. Look, I'm gonna
put my gun away. We're gonna go talk.
I am a martyr. I will bomb myself
on you and all the enemies of Islam!
Allah-hu Akbar... Aagh!
Let's get outta here, Jimmy.
Go play some cards, get drunk.
I'm getting too old for this shit.
(gun clicks shut)
(chamber spins)
(gunshot)
(yells)
(laughs)
(cheering)
- Yo!! Estoy aqu√≠!
- Get the fifties ready, guys.
Gilbert? Booze, free, for me.
- Did you bet with me?
- Against you.
You blew it.
OK, you guys.
This is the moment of truth here.
Come on.
- I told you guys, never bet against me.
- Come on! Get a half a yard in.
Hey, hey. To my partner, Jimmy Hart,
whose skill in spotting bad paper
is only exceeded
by his expertise in rigging a safety line.
How about a speech, boss?
I've been in this racket 25 years,
you guys,
and I don't think anybody has been
put in harm's way more than I have
by this hotshot over here.
- How the hell do you work with him?
- Seriously speaking...
If I'm going in to bag somebody, there's
nobody I'd rather have backing me up.
All right!
Alvarez, next time
you can make a jump with me.
Come on. It's the same thing in your work.
You take it too personally.
You'll never reach retirement.
- I'm not interested in retirement.
- Such a fuckin' a hot dog!
Come here. I got something for you.
Fucking Alvarez trying
to pass a funny 50 on us, huh?
- Retirement present.
- Trying to get rid of me?
It was burning a hole in my truck.
- That's a beauty, Richie.
- They tell me the trout jump all over it.
- You gonna let me use it?
- Come and see me, you can use it.
I'm gonna miss you, amigo.
Yeah. Me too.
- I know you got something on tomorrow.
- You reading my mail?
Masters, right? Where?
You ain't going out there alone.
I got three more days. What's the point
in us both running down the same lead?
We're partners, right?
Sure, and when the bust goes down
you'll be there like always. OK, partner?
Oh, yeah... Thanks.
Give me a call when you get back.

Buddy... you're in the wrong place

DEC. 2415:31 HRS
- See anything, John?
- Nothing.
Is there anything around back?
- See anything around back?
- Nothing.
It's clear over here. The gate's locked.
(flies buzz)
(buzzer)
- Who is it?
- John Vukovich.
- What do you want?
- I'd like to speak to you if I could.
I'm sorry about Jimmy Hart.
Jimmy was more than my partner, pal.
He was my best friend for seven years.
He was the most righteous guy
I ever knew.
He had two days to go and that was it.
Why would somebody waste him
over a counterfeit beef?
Rick Masters killed him.
You see, Jimmy got too close.
We had a tail on him and his mule,
but we couldn't make the plant.
Jimmy found out that warehouse
was rented under a phoney name.
For some reason
he wanted to go out there by himself.
Now you need a partner.
Let me tell you something.
I'm gonna bag Masters.
- I don't give a shit how I do it.
- I hear you.
Can I talk to you?
I was just gonna call you. I've decided
to let Vukovich work with you.
- Do I have a choice?
- Is there someone else you'd prefer?
You can fill out a Form 19, list the reasons
you'd rather not work with him.
- Your input would be confidential.
- Yeah.
Forget it.
What is it you wanted to talk about?
One-way ticket to San Francisco,
Mr Cody. How would you like to pay?
- Cash.
- That'll be $45 one way.
JAN. 311:08 HRS
Federal agent. I'd like to see the bills
that man handed you.
- Have you a pencil with an eraser?
- Sure. Here you go, sir.
- US Secret Service!
- (alarm sounds)
Hold it! Where are you going?
Get out of the way!
Excuse me, Miss.
Hey! What the hell?
Are you some kind of freak?!
- Freeze, asshole!
- What?
- US Secret Service.
- I thought you were...
- You're making a mistake.
- Shut up!
- I'm a businessman.
- Put your hands back here!
Drop it, asshole! I'll blow your head off!
US Secret Service.
I'm arresting this guy for counterfeiting.
Freeze!
- Who are you?
- Secret Service.
I just came in to take a leak.
Morning. Let's go. Get the bag, John.
You got balls coming here.
How're you making it?
Like every other swinging dick
in this place makes it -
day by motherfucking day.
- Ulcer acting up?
- When are you gonna get me out?
I want you to be patient
a little longer, Carl.
I got caught carrying for you.
It's my turn for some consideration.
- You won't have to do the whole nickel.
- What does that mean?
Grimes is the best lawyer in the state.
It'll either be an appeal bond
or a sentence reduction.
The cheque is in the mail, I love you,
and I promise not to come in your mouth.
I'm doing everything I can.
Carl... We gotta talk about Waxman.
- What about him?
- He was your last stop before the airport.
- What are you saying?
- He said you never delivered the package.
What do you mean?
He says I? He never got it?
I counted out 600 grand
right there on his desk.
I had it wrapped in $10,000 packages,
like you told me.
He put it in a safe behind his desk.
He said you called, postponed delivery,
then you were busted at the airport.
He's a lying son of a bitch.
He's probably the motherfucker
who did me.
He ratted me to the Feds. I'll kill him.
When I get out, I'm gonna give that
fucking scumbag a serious headache.
May God strike me dead
if I don't waste him.
Your visit's over.
Don't forget about me.
I won't. You have my word on that.
I've done everything humanly possible.
At this point I don't see any alternative -
Cody's gonna have to do some time.
Why is he being held without bail?
I can't give him an answer.
On suspicion of murdering
a federal agent named Jim Hart.
You told me
you could arrange an appeal bond.
- It's only a postponement.
- I can't fucking tell him that.
The guy got caught holding 40 grand.
What does he expect?
He's gonna have to do a little
to keep the prosecutor happy.
- How much time?
- Say, three?
No. He can't do it.
He'll cave in on me.
What can he give 'em?
Everything.
- What's up?
- You got anything on Rick Masters?
There's a guy in Pasadena. He's a lawyer.
He used to represent hippies.
What's his name?
- Waxman. Max Waxman.
- Waxman? What's his story?
- I think he's moving paper for Masters.
- Good. Is there anything I can do for you?
- My kid's coming in from Las Vegas.
- You got a kid?
Yeah. His name's Christopher.
He lives with his father.
- 500 OK?
- I was kinda hoping...
More if there's a bust.
You know the game.
(discordant music)
- I had a bad dream last night.
- Tell me.
I was on stage and people
were burning me with cigarettes.
Serena writes her dreams down,
keeps them in a book.
Who's Serena?
- What did Carl say?
- He says Max ripped us off.
- You believe him?
- Looks that way.
What are we gonna do about it?
Take care of our problem.
Surveillance log.
US Treasury field office, Los Angeles.
Office of attorney Max Waxman.
Corner of Walnut and Los Robles streets.
This is day three.
January 11th, 22:00 hours.
Reports of agents Vukovich and Chance.
- (Vukovich) Looks like he's got a guest.
- (Chance) Must like tall women.
(Vukovich) What a guy.
What is happening? Long time no see.
Heard you were on stage again.
What does Ricky boy think about that?
- Quantity?
- 125 grand.
I've seen better.
- I'll give you ten points.
- 20 points is the price.
Where am I gonna get 20 points?
Off the back of a turnip truck?
- Tell Rick he can kiss my ass.
- 20 points or I'm out of here.
Hey.
- What do you hear from Cody?
- Problems.
I know you and Rick had your doubts
about me, and I hope that's over with.
I am straight with Rick.
I would never fuck with Rick.
He never talks to me about his business.
He told me to tell you, if you like
the paper, he wants your order... now.
No problem. That's cool.
I'd love to make a jump in the rain.
- Ever do any base jumping?
- Uh-uh.
It's great. I used to jump off garages
when I was a kid.
- Can I bring you something else?
- No, thanks, Father.
(Chance) That's great.
- Why don't you make a jump with me?
- Yeah?
Yeah, you'd love it. Once you get over
the first fear, it's a piece of cake.
It's the greatest feeling
till your balls go right up into your throat.
I think I'll pass, partner.
You know, I could help you
if you ever get in trouble.
- You know what I mean?
- No.
Not here.
I love the rain.
Yeah. It's groovy.
(laughs)
Take off your glasses.
Come here.
- How're you doing, Max?
- Oh, Christ!
First you rip me off, then you set up Carl,
now you wanna fuck my lady.
Man... She came on to me, man.
I swear it.
Oh, what a tragedy.
I want my 600K.
- I didn't have Cody set up...
- Your house is under surveillance.
You're living like an animal in the zoo.
Please, no...
Open up, Max.
Make good and we'll be friends again.
- Rick! Look out!
- Come here.
He's looking for something. Rick!
Aaargh!
(Waxman groans)
18th-century, Cameroon.
- Yes... your taste is in your ass.
- No! Jesus, no!
- Police! Police officer!
- (knocking)
Open the door!
Police! You inside, open the door!
(banging)
- What's going on? Get up!
- What's up?
The whole caper's blown. Come on.
Shit!
- What's that?
- Took it out of Waxman's office.
Some kind of dealer's code.
He's got all his delivery dates in here.
He's got no names,
but he's got amounts, initials.
Look at this. "RM, RM" - every other page.
It's a crime scene. The book is evidence.
What if the cop remembers it?
That rookie couldn't remember.
He wasn't in there long enough.
You shouldn't have done it.
What are you trying to tell me, amigo?
- If you feel strongly, I'll take it back...
- That's not what I'm saying at all.
Don't put words in my mouth, all right?
Does this mean
you won't carry your weight?
If you expect me to take the heat, you
should tell me about it before you do it.
- What would you have said?
- That the cops would have let us copy it.
I wouldn't have done it
if I was with somebody I didn't trust.
Look, I'm no snitch.
Hey, John. Waxman just gave us
Rick Masters on a plate.
(/ "Lullaby" by Wang Chung)
- Who's that?
- It's me.
Too bad about Max.
If you'd caught him dirty, he'd have
done anything to keep outta the joint.
Like you?
(/ "Uphill Climb to the Bottom"
by Walter Jackson on radio)
How much do I get
for the information on Waxman?
No arrest, no money.
It's my fault he's dead? Took me six
months to get next to him. I got expenses.
Uncle Sam don't give a shit about your
expenses. You want bread, fuck a baker.
Someday some guy I set up for you's
gonna snuff me.
It isn't too hard
to figure out who an informant is.
- You gonna stay awhile?
- No. I gotta go.
- I got something for you.
- I'm here.
A dealer from San Francisco's
coming into LA next week
with 50 grand to buy stolen diamonds.
The stuff that was lifted
from the Bel-Air Hotel.
He's connected to people in Hong Kong.
I'm only interested in playdough.
I was reading about the stars. It talked
about how the stars are the eyes of God.
- I think it's true, don't you?
- No. I don't.
If you had any real balls,
you'd jump off that bridge.
Same thing happened to Max
could happen to me, you know.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
What would you do
if I stopped giving you information?
Why?
I'd just like to know.
I'd have your parole revoked.
You mean that? You'd do that?
- Why are you chasing me?
- Why are you running?
Cos you're chasing me.
What do you want?
US Secret Service!
- Get over there!
- OK! Be cool, man.
Hands over your head, shitbag! Put 'em
up! Get your hands behind your head!
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know nothing about it!
I wanna know where Masters prints.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm gonna throw your ass over.
- Talk to me or I throw your ass over!
- No! I don't know!
I don't know where he prints.
Nobody does! I swear to God!
He was in Terminal Island
when I met him.
He was doing time for armed robbery.
That was, oh... 1978?
I was asked to give a talk to the inmates,
look at some of their work.
Masters had talent. You could see that.
I went to his studio one time
and he was burning a couple of paintings
that I thought were quite beautiful.
Do you think you might know
where that studio was?
That was downtown,
past the railroad tracks.
It's an old warehouse,
and there's a Chinese character on it.
- Come on! Come on!
- Shoot it!
- Take a shot!
- Hey!
- How'd that last stuff go?
- I had it sold within a week.
Needed more, but you'd changed
numbers. I had people begging for 20s.
- Had to lay low for a while.
- That's what I heard.
- Heard someone popped your mule.
- That's what I wanted to talk about.
He's up in Obispo
and I think he may try to deal his way out.
- Hm.
- How much of a problem would that be?
Ain't no big thing,
but ain't nobody gonna work for free.
- What would it take?
- 100K in 20s, if they're as good as before.
50,000 in 100s.
It's all I have on hand at the moment.
Big bills ain't popular in this
neighbourhood. It's gotta be 20s.
Well, I might be able to find 50,000 in 20s
lying around somewhere.
Can I ask you something?
As long as you print that shit yourself,
what the hell do you care
if I make 25, 50 or 100 grand?
It be nothing
but motherfucking paper to you.
All right. I'll tell you what.
I'll take 75K in 20s
and I'll personally guarantee the job.
You still driving that piece of shit?
- What shit they showing tonight?
- That galactical warrior movie.
- I hate that space shit.
- It's nothing but science fiction, man.
- What's going down, Ruben?
- They're gonna move on somebody.
- Somebody getting whacked out?
- Yeah.
- Don't know who, huh?
- Uh-uh.
Could be anybody.
Just keep an eye on 'em.
- Am I being hit, man?
- I don't know. It's someone over here.
- Cody!
- You're mine, motherfucker.
Come here, honky.
I got something for your ass.
- Hold it, people!
- (gunshots)
- How're you doing?
- OK. Room three.
Thanks.
Pretty girl, Carl.
Actress?
- Stomach problems, huh?
- Ulcer.
Remember me?
Football game at the airport?
They want me to have an operation,
but I can't stand the thought
of a prison butcher slicing me open.
I'd rather drink this shit pink cement.
I wanna get Rick Masters.
I've taken four falls. I've never ratted
anybody, and I've had plenty of chances.
Masters is your friend. I don't blame you.
I would never hand up a friend.
Anybody who would is a piece of shit.
The thing is, your friend
tried to have you iced.
That doesn't mean I'm gonna roll over
and play informer.
If you're looking for a pigeon,
go to the park.
I'll tell you what.
You help me, I'll have your sentence
reduced to a parole, get you outta here.
- What would I have to do? Like, exactly.
- Simple.
Show me where you print,
and testify against him in open court.
I'd rather stay in here the rest of my life
than testify in open court.
Then lock your cell and throw away the
key, cos I cannot take care of you in here.
(/ "Why Do You Do Me Like You Do?"
By Muddy Waters)
Now you know how it tastes, brother...
Yo, yo, yo.
Hello, Jeff.
What are you doing in my crib?
You sent two assholes to do Cody
and they blew it.
I paid you half. I want it back.
Well... I've been trying
to get that money back myself.
I had to front the whole purchase
to get my people to do their thing.
So I ain't got it no more.
Then you'd better try and shit 40 grand,
because I ain't leaving without it.
I owe you Cody.
Next time there'll be no fuckup.
What next time?
He's in protective custody.
Hell. Protective custody
don't mean shit to me. The man's dead.
In a pig's ass.
I want my paper, Jeff. I can't afford
to have it circulating right now.
I told you I don't have it.
Get it.
Look, my man. I told you
I don't have what you're looking for.
Why don't you make it easy on yourself
and just shag your ass outta my crib?
Now, you be a printer.
Go get some ink,
and start printing some more of that shit.
What's happening, fella?
Yeah, you, asshole!
Goddammit!
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Don't! Don't!
(screams)
You broke your contract with me, Jeff.
I don't know whether you're into it,
but you're gonna have to suck on this
until you give me back my paper.
- How much you gonna burn?
- All of it.
Why?
No good to me after they handled it.
- What do you want?
- I got a writ I need you to sign.
- What kind of a writ?
- I need the release of a prisoner.
Must be a big case.
A counterfeiter
involved in the murder of a federal agent.
I never sign such writs.
Why are you still here?
I spent all morning on this.
I would appreciate it if you'd look at it.
- OK. I've looked at it.
- I've gotta have this guy out.
Didn't you ask me
to hold him without bail?
Yes. I'll assume responsibility
for getting him back.
I don't need the headache.
Cody is an associate of Rick Masters.
Masters has been
making a mockery out of us all.
That doesn't change the fact he's on
a no-bail hold awaiting arraignment.
He killed my partner, man.
The answer is still no.
If I was one of your asshole cronies,
you'd do this for me.
Don't say something you'll regret later.
Come back here!
Let me look at it again.
If this prisoner escapes from custody,
I'll make you testify in open court
how he made a fool out of you.
Now get the hell out of here.
If you cross me, I will put you back in here
and I will make sure you do all five.
JAN 19, 11:19 HRS
I wanna know where
you and Masters print, you take me there,
then we're going to swear out
your statement.
- Can I ask a favour?
- What?
My daughter's in the hospital. Do you
think we could stop by Santa Fe Hospital?
It's on the way to where I'm taking you.
- You're pulling my dick.
- I swear. Check it out.
- What's her name?
- Roseanne Brown.
Lincoln 14-3-1 to Los Angeles base. Over.
Go ahead, 3-1.
Request you phone Santa Fe Hospital.
Find out if they have a patient
named Roseanne Brown. Over.
Roger.
- D'you have any kids?
- Uh-uh.
- It changes the way you look at things.
- Yeah?
I'm not looking to screw up any more.
Roseanne Brown is in room 306.
- The elevators are there.
- Thank you.
You have to come up
to the room with me?
Come here.
- What happened to your daughter?
- She was on the monkey bars...
Agh!
Aaaagh!
Roseanne Brown is a black woman.
She's recuperating from a fall
she took from a bicycle near USC.
She's married. Her husband is serving
time at San Luis Obispo prison.
- Thanks.
- Let us take a look at you.
- I'm in the middle of a trial.
- What kind of trial?
It's a dope case. Client got busted
smuggling 50Ib of cocaine.
- I'll get him off. Search warrant's weak.
- Weak?
The colour of the house
is listed as brown
when, in fact, it's beige and yellow.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I don't apologise for being an attorney.
If I didn't accept the case,
somebody else would, without a doubt.
It's too bad about Jim Hart.
Masters has been calling me in the middle
of the night, trying to order me around.
He even had the balls to threaten me.
The man's an animal.
Frankly, being house counsel for Rick
Masters doesn't sit very well with me.
- I've had it up to here, as a matter of fact.
- Good for you.
How bad do you
and your friend want him?
You know what would happen
to my practice
if there was a hint
that I set up one of my own clients.
Aren't you afraid
you'll wind up on his hit list?
- It crossed my mind.
- Your name will never come up.
- You've never met Rick, have you?
- No.
I'll set up a meeting.
Mr Masters?
How're you doing?
Ben Jessup. Dr George Victor.
- How do you do?
- Cut yourself shaving, Mr Jessup?
No. I got hit by a tennis ball.
- You're in from Palm Springs?
- Yeah.
What's the weather like there?
- Nice.
- We've been up here the last few days.
I've got a friend in Palm Springs.
Lenny Greene.
He owns the Oasis. Do you know him?
I got a friend in Hollywood.
Donald Duck. You know him?
I understand you gentlemen
do some island banking. Where?
- Cayman Islands.
- Good business?
- Not bad.
- What sort of banking?
We're a Dutch Antilles company.
We loan money to enterprises
here in the States.
Loans aren't secured by real estate
down there.
Hey, Rick. You got a phone call, man.
Which one is it?
There's nothing in there.
Some tennis racquets in the trunk,
men's clothing
with Palm Springs store labels,
business letters with return addresses
in the Cayman Islands.
- What did the letters say?
- "Please forward the stock" or something.
Who were the letters addressed to?
Caribbean Banking Unlimited,
Dutch Antilles.
Did you notice the names Jessup or Victor
on any of the letters?
- No.
- OK. Thanks.
What kind of paper we talking about?
100s and 50s.
We need ten different serial numbers.
- And how much?
- A million dollars.
How are you gonna use it?
What business is that of yours?
It's always my business, Mr Jessup.
Nothing will be passed up here.
Our play involves an out-of-state man
who wishes to launder some bonds.
My end is 20%.
- We never pay more than ten.
- We have limitations...
Different serial numbers
are a pain in the ass for me.
I gotta make different plates and wear
rubber gloves through the operation.
Have you ever tried
to work with rubber gloves on?
- 15%.
- I don't negotiate.
I might if I knew you, but I don't,
and I don't like what I see.
All right.
I start as soon as I get a down payment.
In this case, I'll take 30,000 up front
- and the rest on delivery.
- What?
Everybody knows Rick Masters
won't go near a job without front money.
You should also know that I've never
fucked a customer out of his front money.
I've been coming to this gym
three or four times a week for five years.
I'm an easy man to find.
My reputation speaks for itself.
The fact is, if you can't come up
with the front money,
you're not for real.
No way can I get you 30K. You'd hear 'em
laughing all the way from Washington.
Masters beats the government
out of that in a day.
We got a chance to make him on a buy,
which he cannot beat in court.
You're not the first agents to get next to
Masters. He always asks for front money.
Nobody approves it,
and he stays on the street.
The limit for buys is ten grand.
You could get this approved
if you wanted to.
- 302.5.
- What?
302.5. You violated section 302.5.
The manual says "the agents must
notify the agent in charge..." That's me.
"...of all ongoing investigations."
You violated this section.
- I'm not covering your ass.
- I'm not asking you to.
You lost a federal prisoner, and I want
Cody back. Where the hell were you?
- Hey, hey, hey! He wasn't with me.
- Why not?
I lost him. I'll get him back.
Thank you, Gilbert.
We should have offered Masters
ten grand. He'd have gone for it.
Never happen, Johnny.
- Let me try something on you.
- Yeah? What?
Ruth tells me there's a guy coming in
to buy stolen diamonds.
He's gonna be carrying $50,000 cash.
- So?
- So what do you think?
What do I think about what?
Guy comes in Thursday. Union Station.
No muss, no fuss. Everything doesn't
look like a piece of cake, we walk away.
- Jesus, you gotta be kidding.
- I told you I was gonna get Masters.
- You wanna commit a robbery?
- I wouldn't call it that.
- What would you call it?
- Taking down a douchebag.
- If it turns to shit?
- We say fuck it, walk away.
It's the only way to get Masters to print...
I don't give a shit.
I'm not gonna pull a heist.
The guy's a fence.
He can't walk into a fucking police station.
Why don't you just blow his brains out?
That's what you wanna do.
All I'm asking you to do is drive the car.
Steal real money to buy counterfeit
money? How's that gonna look in court?
- It's his word against ours.
- His lawyer is Bob Grimes.
You got a couple of screws loose, pal.
- Listen. I say we go to Bateman...
- Fuck Bateman.
- He's out to save his ass.
- You're pushing it too fast.
It's happening Thursday.
My father was a cop.
You're asking me to do something...
- Give me a break!
- You got the wrong guy. OK?
You're right I got the wrong guy, pal.
You ain't my partner.
You ain't even my fucking friend.
You'd better get your ass into protection
cos you ain't shit on the street.
You understand? You ain't got the nuts.
Kiss my ass!
(/ "Dance Hall Days" by Wang Chung)
How sure is this thing tomorrow?
- You weren't interested in diamonds.
- Now I am interested.
All I know is what I told you.
He's on the number 11 Amtrak
leaving San Francisco 7 am,
getting into Union Station at 4.35.
How d'you remember that?
You wrote it down or what?
- Who's the seller?
- A guy I know.
What did this guy you know tell you?
That a Chinaman comes down from
San Francisco and buys diamonds, gold.
What's his name?
Ling. Thomas Ling.
What's your end?
- Nothing. It's just a guy I know...
- A guy you know!
A guy you know gives you
the train he's coming in on?
Of course not. I called Amtrak
and got his reservation.
Why? Why'd you do that?
ID and a dollar fifty.
You were planning on having someone
else take him down. Is that right?
Thought about it.
- Why are you suddenly interested?
- It fits some other shit that's happening.
- You gonna bag him?
- I might.
When he's carrying real cash
and hasn't committed a crime?
I can do whatever I want.
- How much is in this for me?
- How much of what?
Don't shit me. I know what you're gonna
do, and they're gonna think I set it up.
- All right. I'll give you five Gs.
- Not enough!
And my promise
not to throw you back in the joint.
THURSDAY JAN 2416:05 HRS
(PA) Mr Thomas Ling,
please come to Passenger Services.
Passenger Thomas Ling
arriving on Amtrak 708,
please come to Passenger Services.
I'm Thomas Ling.
- Know what this is?
- What's the game?
- It's no game. Just walk.
- Why?
If you don't
I'll blow your fucking heart out.
- Where's the key?
- I don't have it.
He doesn't have it. What a guy.
(honking)
Over the chain.
Come on. Get over the chain.
Grab the wall. Right there.
Hold that.
Fuck it!
What the fuck?
There are people all over the place!
That's very funny.
He doesn't have it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Where is it?
Son of a bitch! You move
and I'll blow your fucking brains out!
Freeze! Get down on your fucking knees!
Put your hands behind your fucking head!
Goddammit!
You're wearing it, ain't ya?
Get your clothes off.
Come on! Two hands! Take your shirt off.
Oh, that's great.
That's it. Get your pants down.
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Get your pants down.
Fuck!
- You all right?
- Oh, Christ.
Let's get outta here. Come on.
Let's get outta here. Come on!
- Are you hit?
- I don't know. I don't think so.
(truck horn)
Look out. Look out, for God's sake!
- Get 'em outta there.
- Move the truck!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Shut up! Move it out of the way, now!
Back it up, Steve! Back it up!
(sounds horn)
(pedestrian) You fucking asshole!
- (truck horn)
- Go left!
(gunshots)
Hold on.
- I think we lost the mothers.
- I don't see 'em, man.
- We fucking did it, man!
- We made it, baby!
Goddammit! We did it!
Oh, shit! You had me scared out of
my fucking mind, man. You had me...
(gunshot)
- Sons of bitches!
- Is it the same guy?
It's two different guys. It's two Chevys.
(gunshots)
What the hell is going on?
Who the fuck are these guys?
- They're all over the place.
- Hang on, Johnny!
A piece of cake, huh?
You son of a bitch!
Cap one off, Johnny. Get 'em off of me.
(Vukovich groans)
Oh, God...
They're all over the place.
We're going this way.
- Get the fuck outta there!
- Asshole!
- Crazy fucking asshole.
- Hold it!
Get out of the way! Get outta there!
Oh, my God!
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!
(radio) There's a minor tie-up
on the north Long Beach.
A couple of cars have tangled in traffic.
A very simple affair. No injuries involved.
Shouldn't cost you more
than a couple of minutes.
I'm Stacey Binn for Metro Traffic Control.
What are we gonna do?!
We're going to an auto-parts store,
get a new window.
If we'd totalled it, we'd never
have got it back to the motor pool.
We lucked out, Johnny!
We lucked out! Whoo!
Listen, I'll have to get back to you.
- What happened? I called you all day.
- Clockwork. Like fucking clockwork.
- D'you hear anything?
- The Chinaman never showed up.
He sure didn't.
God! 50,000 bucks.
Quentin Dailey got 30 points, they said.
The guy's unbelievable.
Michael Jordan's a great ball player...
- These people aren't dumb.
- Dailey's got a gun like a howitzer.
30 feet. Boom! Boom! Boom!
- When he gets hot, he's fabulous.
- I'm worried.
- You got a fucking...
- I'm worried!
The stars are God's eyes.
What's the matter with you?
The last item on the agenda
is a bulletin from the FBI.
"On January 24th,
FBI Special Agent Raymond Fong
of the Bureau
of San Francisco Field Office
was robbed
of $50,000 in government funds."
"Fong, who was acting in an undercover
capacity as part of a sting operation,
was abducted and murdered
after arriving at Union Station."
"The suspects are described
as white males, 30-35 years old,
one with black,
the other with brown hair."
"They eluded Fong's covering agents
and fled in a beige Chevrolet."
"Anyone having information, contact
the agent in charge, FBI, San Francisco."
- Is there a licence on the vehicle?
- No plates on the vehicle.
This is what happens when proper
covering procedures are not followed.
- We got an FBI agent killed!
- What do you want me to do about it?
They can identify us -
they got a good look at us.
- A face is bullshit without a name.
- They got a make on the car!
They wouldn't have sent it out if they
had anything. They're grabbing at shit.
Oh, Jesus. What are
we gonna do about the 50 grand?
Make the buy from Masters,
just like we planned.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I want a stand-up ashtray.
These guys are stealing all my ashtrays.
Just like we planned, amigo.
(Masters) Over here.
Who are they?
- Who are you?
- This is Mr Jessup.
Whose name isn't really Jessup.
Who says he's from Palm Springs,
but doesn't have a tan.
You're not wired, are you?
Is this my package?
(ripping sound)
Look OK?
You're beautiful.
When do I get delivery?
How about Friday night?
If I don't hear from you,
I'll come back to get this.
That's understandable.
Oh, Mr Jessup?
Like your work.
Your only defence
is that you were undercover
without the knowledge
of your supervisors.
You were trying to get Masters,
things got out of hand,
and you intended to return the money.
Problem is, the prosecutor
can ask you anything he wants.
Frankly, I don't think
you can beat the case in court.
Because I represent Masters,
I can't get deeply involved in your case.
So what should I do?
- Beat 'em to the punch and make a deal.
- What kind of deal?
You offer to plead guilty
and to testify against your partner.
The FBI's not gonna want
a lot of publicity on this.
I suspect they'll go along
with a guilty plea.
How much time would I have to do?
Probably get you off with seven years.
You won't have to do seven, of course -
probably a year and a half.
- But you can't get involved, right?
- Not directly.
What would it cost
for your indirect involvement?
$50,000.
I know it's a tough call, but it's one
you're gonna have to make quickly.
I can't hand up my partner.
I can't do it -
even if I have to go to the joint.
Honey?
(cocks gun)
Shit, you OK, Carl?
- I guess we all screw up.
- How did you find me?
Your girlfriend's
in the screen actors' directory.
- I never saw this guy!
- Sit down, Claudia, and shut up!
You're a lucky man. I didn't
tell the judge you played hooky on me.
Now you're gonna help me out.
Come on, asshole, let's go. Move!
(yelling/cheering)
Hi. Is Chance there?
I wanna talk to Chance.
Is this 4-7-14-4-2-1?
This is John Vukovich.
There's no one here by that name.
- Who is it?
- John Vukovich.
John. Listen, I got Cody back.
I know where the plant is.
We gotta go to Bateman.
I can't live with this thing.
I talked to Masters. We're on tonight.
- What are you talking about?
- We're on with Masters tonight.
- Do you need me tonight?
- I don't think so.
- What time do you get off?
- About 12.30.
OK. Got a few things to do and then
I'll drop by and pick you up at the club.
All right?
You look beautiful.
I got a little surprise for you.
(/ "Wake Up, Stop Dreaming"

JAN. 3005:15:00 HRS
You packing? Checking to see
if you got a wire on, brother.
- Let's see that bag.
- Don't touch me.
- Look, dickhead...
- Keep your hands off!
If you wanna get up them stairs,
you go through me.
- If he thinks I'm a Fed...
- It's OK, Jack.
Go on up, tough guy.
So what's in the briefcase, Doctor?
We're the ones who fronted the 30 grand
and agreed to do this on your turf.
Before you touch shit,
I wanna see the funny money.
Locker 38.
OK?
You're beautiful.
- Turn around!
- Right there, asshole!
Hands on top of the locker.
Grab the top of the fucking locker!
That's right. You're under arrest, moron.
Go on. Cuff the ape. Don't move!
How're you doing, pal? This is from
Jimmy Hart from the desert. Remember?
Suck on that for a while.
- Freeze it up, pal!
- Jesus Christ.
Talk to me, man. Talk to me.
Talk to me!
Oh, God!
You can't do this to me!
Oh, God.
Why didn't you take the deal
Grimes offered you?
- Wouldn't roll over on your partner?
- Get up.
Get up, you son of a bitch!
Aaargh!
You might want these.
They're very personal.
Yes.
I can't seem to find any of his paintings.
He told me he did
two large portraits of you.
They might be worth a lot of money.
He used to burn a lot of things.
Maybe he burned them.
I can't understand
how you stayed with him so long.
- Why did you work for him?
- It's just business.
(/ "L.A., L.A." by AM-FM)
- Who is it?
- John Vukovich.
- What do you want?
- Chance was my partner.
- I know who you are. What do you want?
- Did you know he was dead?
- I'm busy now.
- Open it.
- You going somewhere?
- I'm leaving the city.
There's a matter of 20 grand
that belongs to the federal government.
Chance said he left it with you.
We want it back.
Part of that money was mine.
I had debts, people leaning on me.
- I got ripped off for the rest.
- You set us up.
- You knew that Chinaman was FBI.
- I what? Are you crazy?
Don't shine me on.
If you're gonna bullshit me, we're
gonna get off to a very bad relationship.
What are you talking about?
You're working for me now.
