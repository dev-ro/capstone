There's a feeling.
The pulse of eternal knowledge.
When you sense the oneness...
you are with us.
We brought life to Earth.
You can't see us,
but we flourish
all around you.
Everywhere.
In everything.
And even inside you,
whether you believe in us
or not.
From your first breath
to your last,
in darkness
and in the light,
we are the oldest
and youngest.
We are the largest
and smallest.
We are the wisdom
of a billion years.
We are creation.
We are resurrection,
condemnation,
and regeneration.
We are mushrooms.
Mushrooms are very clandestine
and very much the trickster.
So, they're hiding
from you all the time.
We're in Agarikon territory
now.
There're some big
living snags up here.
It's always interesting
and exhilarating
to be in the old growth forest,
but not always rewarding
in accomplishing our mission
to find a new Agarikon strain,
but nevertheless,
it beats being
in the office.
Fungi are the grand molecular
decomposers of nature.
Now, what does that mean?
Well,
they break down wood,
and here I'm laying
in the forest.
I haven't peeked yet,
but here's a piece of wood
laying down on the ground.
If I was laying down
on the ground and I died,
fungi would leap up
to recycle me.
Well, that's the way
of nature.
Mushrooms represent rebirth,
rejuvenation, regeneration.
Fungi generate soil
that gives life.
The task that we face today
is to understand
the language of nature.
My mission is to discover the language
of nature of the fungal networks
that communicate
with the ecosystem,
and I believe
nature is intelligent.
The fact that we lack the language
skills to communicate with nature
does not impugn the concept
that nature's intelligent.
It speaks to our inadequacy
for communication.
If we don't get our act together and
come in commonality and understanding
with the organisms
that sustain us today,
not only will we destroy
those organisms,
but we will
destroy ourselves.
Mushroom.
It's not like a vegetable,
and it's not like a animal,
but it's somewhere in between.
The fungus is
its own kingdom altogether.
There's over
1.5 million species.
That's six times more
than plants.
Of all those species
of fungi,
about 20,000
produce mushrooms,
and mushrooms come
in an incredible diversity
of shapes and sizes
and colors and lifestyles.
There are even bioluminescent
mushrooms.
A lot of people are afraid
of mushrooms.
People associate mushrooms
and fungi... you know, mold...
with death and decay,
which makes sense.
You know,
there's a lot of fear
because of fungi's role
in the cycle of life.
They decompose
dead and dying organisms
and move all those nutrients
back into the cycle.
They kind of are
at the very end of stuff,
but they're also
at the beginning.
Once you start
working with mushrooms,
you get drawn in.
A really important difference
between plants and fungi
is that plants have evolved
to catch your eye.
When a tomato gets red,
it is saying,
"Hey, I'm ready. Come get me."
The mushrooms
don't give a shit.
They're doing their own thing,
and a lot of them are hiding.
Every time you pick up
a mushroom,
you are faced
with the omnivore's dilemma.
Do I know enough
to eat this?
Should I eat this?
Will this kill me?
And that's one
of the reasons why
people are freaked out
about mushrooms, because yeah,
there are ones
that can kill you.
There are some that'll take out
your liver or your kidneys,
but to be honest with you, there's berries
in the woods that can kill you too.
So, it's really a matter
of knowing your mushrooms.
There's a huge subculture
of mycophiles,
of people who are fascinated
with mushrooms.
They hunt mushrooms together,
and they eat mushrooms together,
and they're sort
of bloated pleasure seekers
with a scientific bent.
You know,
really my kind of crowd.
This is a tricholoma.
Grifola frondosa.
This is
Cortinarius.
Agaricus bisporus.
That's a Cladonia lichen.
So I started attending
these festivals and forays
and learning more and more.
It changed the way
I saw everything.
Mushrooms actually
were the window by which
I came to understand nature
in a deeper way.
If we didn't have fungi,
we would get this buildup of plant
matter that would choke the Earth.
They really are the key.
They break down plant life
and make it usable
for new plant life
and for animal life.
They are the digestive
tracts of the forest.
One of the lifestyles of fungi
is as decomposers,
called saprobes or rotters,
if you want.
The yeasts and molds used in
making beer and wine and cheese
are all saprobes.
That's actually
a penicillin mold
in Gorgonzola
and Roquefort.
Bourbon
is fungi-fermented corn.
But this ability
to break things down
is a talent,
if you will,
that can be harnessed
to help us deal with some
of our problems like pollution.
These rotters,
they can break down
anything that's natural.
That's what
they've evolved to do.
Anything
that's hydrocarbon-based,
so that includes stuff
like oil spills,
pollutant problems.
That's kind
of the truth of it.
I was a part
of this experiment.
There were four piles saturated
with diesel
and other petroleum waste.
One was a control pile,
one pile was treated
with enzymes,
one pile treated
with a bacteria,
and our pile, we inoculated
with mushroom spores.
The fungi absorbs the oil,
so the fungi is producing
enzymes for oxidases
that break
carbon-hydrogen bonds.
These are the same bonds
that hold hydrocarbons together.
So the fungi becomes saturated
with oil.
And then when we returned
six weeks later,
all the tarps were removed.
All the other piles
were dead, dark and stinky.
We came back to our pile.
It was covered with hundreds
of pounds
of oyster mushrooms.
Some of these mushrooms
are very happy mushrooms.
They were very large,
by showing how much nutrition
that they could obtain.
But something else happened,
which was an epiphany in my life.
They sporulated.
The spores attract insects.
Birds then came,
bringing in seeds,
and our pile became
an oasis of life.
Mushrooms are
the fruiting bodies of fungi.
So the mushroom
is like the apple.
The bulk of the organism
is growing underground
and it's composed
of these long threads
and these threads grow
one cell at a time
and then they branch
and rebranch,
growing in every direction
they can,
even three-dimensionally.
And that mass of threads
is called a mycelium.
When a stick falls
onto the ground...
you pull it up...
and there's mycelium.
It is virtually everywhere.
A mycelium has more networks
than our brain
has neural pathways,
and works
in much the same way,
with electrolytes,
electrical pulses.
They're the most common species
on Earth.
They're everywhere.
Just to give you an idea of how
much fungi are in the forest,
what you're walking through
is about 300 miles of fungi
under every footstep
that you take.
And that's
all over the world.
And they form
these massive links.
It's like a big web just growing
through the forest.
Mycelium that can grow out
even just this big
can have trillions, literally
trillions, of end branchings.
Almost everyone knows
about the computer internet.
The mycelium shares
the same network design.
Trees are communicating,
using the mycelium as pathways.
They're connecting
one tree to another.
They're using the mycelium too
to feed one another.
In other words, one tree can
swap nutrients with another tree,
using mycelium
as the passageway.
So we often think of kin
recognition as an animal behavior.
Humans, you know,
we love our babies.
We know it's our baby,
and we're going to look after that baby.
Well, we never thought
that plants could do that,
but we're finding
in our research
that plants can recognize
their own kin.
So these mother trees
recognize their kin
through
their mycorrhizal networks.
The mother tree and the baby
seedlings are sending signals,
talking to each other.
When they're connected
together
and carbon is moving
between plants,
the trees are supporting
the weaker ones.
If she knows that there's pests
around, and that she's under danger,
she will increase her competitive
environment towards her own babies,
so that they regenerate
further away.
It's a magical thing.
And this could not happen
without the fungi.
I'm not this
super-idealist tree hugger.
I do hug trees occasionally.
I do confess to that,
but I was a logger.
I cut the woods.
Damn, we got a two-for-one
on that one.
Cutting down these trees
and we're going to let them rot,
but we're letting them rot
with a purpose.
We're letting them rot
with shiitake mushrooms,
which are delicious
and medicinal... Yes!
September of '74,
Paul was working as a logger
in Darrington.
I went up to visit him
one weekend,
and we were out walking
in the woods,
and I started showing him
all these mushrooms, you know?
He says, "What are those?"
I said,
"You're looking at mushrooms,"
...for the first time.
We came around a corner and
there's this purple mushroom.
I'd never seen one
like that before.
It was just
like this huge epiphany,
like... Whoo-whoo!
You know?
And that's where it began.
He just never stopped.
These are old red belted
polypores.
Elegant polyporus.
It's got a furry stem.
This is a delicious
shrimp russula mushroom,
edible and choice,
and it grows here
in the old growth forest.
It's rare in science
you have such powerful amateurs.
The meaning of the word
"amateur" is a lover,
and he loves his mushrooms.
And he's proven that amateurs can
do credible, important research.
And that used
to be the case.
The 19th century obviously,
you know, was full of
great amateur naturalists,
Darwin being one of them.
He's handed over
to this universal consciousness.
That's where genius
comes from.
Every magnificent thing
that humans have ever achieved
comes from that place.
I grew up in a
small town called Columbiana, Ohio.
Very conservative,
very religious.
And my brother John
went to Yale,
and my brother Bill went
to Cornell.
So we were
an academic family.
But I had
a severe stuttering habit
that greatly interfered with
my ability to express myself.
I went through six years
of speech therapy.
I could not speak
a single sentence
without stuttering
profusely,
and nothing in speech therapy
could help me.
I couldn't look at people
in their eyes.
So all my life,
I stared at the ground.
Anybody came up to me,
I'd stare at the ground.
I found fossils
and mushrooms.
We are all of the stars.
My kingdom was born
from the heavens
four and a half billion
years ago.
We are the pioneers.
We climbed out of the sea
to create the fertile soil,
and set the stage
for all of life.
In South Africa,
in the sediments of lava,
they have found
fungus-like organisms,
mycelium fossils in the lava
2.4 billion years old.
This is the oldest record of a
multicellular organism on Earth.
This year another fossil was
found in the sediments of Brazil.
It's 113 million years old
and it's a perfectly shaped
mushroom.
We divided from fungi
about 650 million years ago.
One branch led to fungi.
The other branch led
to animals.
We chose a path of encirculating our
nutrients in sort of a sac, the stomach.
The mycelium
remained underground,
externally digesting
its nutrients.
Biodiversity surged...
until we had these great
cataclysmic extinction events,
and when the asteroids
impacted the Earth, bam!
Enormous amounts of debris was
jettisoned in the atmosphere.
Sunlight was cut off.
Plants die, animals die...
and fungi inherited
the Earth.
From these extinction events,
there's one lesson.
Those organisms
that paired with fungi survived.
We are more closely related
to fungi
than we are
to any other kingdom.
What this means is that
we are descendants of mycelium.
Mycelium is the mother
of us all.
Living creatures
like fungi are intelligent
in the sense that they respond
to their environment,
they seek out food,
and they defend themselves.
They solve problems,
and that's intelligence.
A mycelium can
theoretically live forever
as long as it
has food to grow into,
which is why the oldest
and largest organism on Earth
is a fungus.
It lives on top
of a mountain in Oregon.
It's like thousands
of acres,
and it's thousands
of years old.
The mushroom is the organ
of sexual reproduction
for the spore
of the fungus.
Fungi don't have seeds.
They have spores.
The spores are extremely tiny,
little lightweight
gene-carrying systems.
When they land on something
they can eat,
they break down the food
that they're on,
and then reabsorb
the nutrients
because you need
to move on
and find another place
where there's food.
The mushroom releases zillions
of spores into the atmosphere.
There's so many spore.
I mean,
you take one breath...
you just breathed in
ten fungal spore.
So they are everywhere.
We've evolved with them.
When you see what mushrooms do,
it's kind of spooky
in the most wonderful way.
I mean, they correct everything
on Earth.
They support life,
they convert life,
they carry life.
They're remarkable beings.
If humans become extinct...
what's the next species
that will take over the Earth?
Maybe mycelium already are
the dominant species,
not just because they're the
most common species on Earth.
They're everywhere.
I mean, you look at humans.
There's seven billion of us,
but we're just one little
creature wandering around,
incredibly vulnerable,
and don't survive easily
if we're assaulted.
Hurricane Harvey
has started to make landfall
here on the Texas coast.
More than 30,000 people
are without power,
and things are only expected
to get worse.
Puerto Rico
has had the worst storm
in about a century,
and it's struggling
to understand the new normal
of months ahead
without basic services.
Climate change is one of the
biggest threats to our present world,
to the future of our planet.
CO2 is our
biggest greenhouse gas.
As plants photosynthesize,
they literally inhale CO2
while exhaling oxygen.
CO2 is what plants
photosynthesize,
and they take that carbon,
and they put it in different places.
They put it in their leaves,
in their trunks,
but they put 70% of it,
we're finding, below ground.
And the root systems trade that
carbon for nutrients.
The carbon ends up in the fungal
cell walls, where it's stored.
This fuels
the microbial community
and all the other parts
of the food web,
like the mites and nematodes,
and they start
cycling nutrients
through
that eating process.
So the fungi
are really important
in stabilizing carbon
in soils.
Once the carbon is stable,
it can stay there stored
for thousands of years.
We know, for example,
that carbon can move from plant to plant,
and it evens out the distribution
of carbon in that system.
They're working really hard.
If we maintain the plant,
the forest, and the natural
fungal community,
we've got a natural engine
that's just storing carbon
below ground.
So it's essential.
You know,
it's there for us, right?
It's right
in front of us.
We do more than make mushrooms.
We have the ability to do so much
more than just breakdown matter.
Like the fruit
of our labor,
most of you have only scratched
the surface of our usefulness.
We are the changers.
I was 14 or 15 years of
age, I believe,
when my brother John
gave me a book...
called Altered States
of Consciousness.
And within that book,
Andy Weil was referenced
on expanded consciousness,
and I got really excited.
I was going to charismatic
Christian revival meetings
and seeing people
being saved,
but it kind of was cool
from my perspective
that they're achieving this
altered state of consciousness.
So I thought that was part
of all the same idea here.
I really owe credit
to Andrew Weil.
I think he
read one of my early books
in which I wrote
about mushroom hunting
and psychedelic mushrooms
and made some reference
to medicinal mushrooms as well.
It was like
a turning point.
You know,
I certainly was awakened.
Other people were thinking
about expanding consciousness.
And so I gave this book
to my friend Ryan Snyder.
So Ryan took it home
and a few days later,
I said,
"Ryan, where's my book?"
And he told me
his dad had burned it.
I said, "Burned my book?"
Rather than giving it back to me
or calling my parents,
he actually took the initiative
to burn this book.
I owe Ryan Snyder's father
a deep debt of gratitude
because that single act
galvanized my interest
saying, "If this is so powerful to
cause a person to do such a bizarre act,
then I should examine
what this subject's all about."
Human existence
on this Earth goes back
an extraordinarily long
period of time,
most of which we have
no identifiable information.
It's entirely plausible,
given that the indigenous people
all around the world
know intimately
all the plant life,
and will know the different
combinations of plant life
that our prehistoric
ancestors,
they had come across the plants
that do alter consciousness.
In about two million years,
the human cortex tripled
in size,
and the brain exploded
over a ridiculously short span
of evolutionary time.
Two million years is nothing
when it comes to evolution.
What triggered that?
In the late 1970s,
Terrence McKenna
and his brother Dennis McKenna
were the first that proposed
the Stoned Ape hypothesis.
It is known now
that 22 primates...
23, including us...
consume mushrooms.
And the idea is our ancestors,
they came out of the trees
and went across the savannah,
would be tracking animals
that were pooping.
Well, in the subtropics,
the most common mushroom
coming out
of those cow patties
is Psilocybe cubensis,
a potent magic mushroom.
One thing that mushrooms
and other psychedelics
do reliably
is they induce
a synesthesia.
Synesthesia is the perception
of one sensory modality
in another,
hearing colors, for example,
or seeing music.
You have these profound
experiences
and you have to put yourself
in their place
and imagine what the impact
of such an experience
must have been
on an early hominid.
These magic mushrooms open up
the floodgates of information
you receive.
Basically, you can think of it
as a contact fluid
between the synapses
within the brain... Wow!
What a competitive
advantage,
especially if you're working
with a geometry of weapons,
or having
to put together something
that will give you a better
chance of survival.
The fact that this happened
not once, not twice,
but millions
upon millions of times
over millions of years
is a very plausible
explanation
for the tripling of the brain
two million years ago.
It's not so simple to say
that they ate psilocybin mushrooms
and suddenly the brain mutated.
I think it's more complex
than that,
but I think it was a factor.
It was like a software
to program this neurologically
modern hardware to think,
to have cognition,
to have language
because language
is essentially synesthesia.
Language
is just association
with apparently
meaningless sound
except that it's associated
with the complex of meaning.
A great deal of the brain's
real estate, you might say,
is devoted to the generation
and/or the comprehension
of language.
Those neural structures
are not found in our ancestors.
That's a human trait
to have so much physiology
devoted to generating
and understanding language,
and that's a reflection
of evolutionary advance
that made us
what we are.
I couldn't get these
mushrooms for the longest time.
When I was in Ohio,
I actually purchased
a bag of magic mushrooms,
but I had no guide.
I had no recommendations
for how much to consume.
So I had a bag about this big,
so I thought,
"Well, that's probably
one dose."
So I consumed the bag!
Now, for those of you
who don't know,
this is like ten times more
than you probably need
to consume.
It was a warm summer day,
and there was a beautiful
big, big tree,
an oak tree,
and then I noticed
the black clouds
on the horizon,
and I realized
there was a storm coming.
And I thought,
"This is great.
There's great visual.
The storm coming."
And I thought,
"I'm going to climb
to the top of the tree."
So I'm starting
to feel the effects.
I'm getting waves
where the air becomes a liquid,
and...
you'd have this distortion field
go through the visual landscape.
I've never seen that before,
and go, "Oh wow, this is what
they were talking about."
And I see the boiling clouds
are coming closer,
but they're looking angry now.
And then the lightning strikes
would go...
and then
all these geometrical fractals
would emanate out
of the lightning strikes.
And pretty soon,
I have these overlying mosaics
of mathematical patterns
and geometric figures
of multiple colors
that are swimming
in this field of vision
that these waves
were flying through.
I've never in my life
seen anything like that before.
Wind's increasing
and the rains would come,
and I became extremely scared.
And then also I realize
I'm on the top of a hill,
I got a lightning storm
in the tallest tree.
Not the best place to be
when you're going to choose
a spiritual experience.
And so I held onto the tree
for dear life,
and that tree
was my pillar,
back into the core
of the Earth.
And I felt secure as long
as I held onto the tree.
Lightning strikes all around.
Thunderclaps.
One second between the lightning
strike and a thunderclap.
You knew it was coming
closer and closer.
I was terrified
that I wouldn't survive,
And through
this "terr-rific" experience,
terrifying and terrific
at the same time,
I'm up in this tree
and I'm saying,
"Well, what should I focus on?"
I said, "Well, Stamets,
you're not stupid.
But you stutter all the time."
And so I thought
I need to stop stuttering.
And so I said to myself,
"Stop stuttering.
Stop stuttering now."
A little inner voice
in my head.
"You hear me?
Stop stuttering now."
I started saying that.
"Stop stuttering now.
Stop stuttering now."
Hundreds, hundreds, hundreds,
thousands of times.
After the storm had passed,
I came down
from the tree drenched,
soaked to the bone,
you know,
in love with life,
with nature,
in love with that tree.
That tree was so important
to me.
And I went home,
and I went to bed.
I didn't see anybody.
And the next morning
I woke up,
and there was
a really attractive lady
that I liked a lot,
but I could never stare at her
in the eyes,
because I was afraid to stutter
and embarrass myself.
So better to avoid social
contact than have social contact,
even though
I was really attracted to her.
And she liked me,
but I didn't know what to do
with it,
with that tension.
And so she was walking past me,
and she looked at me,
and she said,
"Good morning, Paul."
And for the first time
I looked her straight
in the eye
and I said,
"Good morning. How are you?"
And I stopped stuttering
in one session.
This is the newest thing
my employees are listening to.
My employees are my best
source of new music.
We love loud music for the
mushrooms in the laboratories.
It causes everyone
to be synchronized.
We have a lot of nonverbal
communication in laboratories.
You're not allowed to talk.
Your mouth spreads bacteria.
So we try
to minimize talking.
So a lot of it is done
by gestures and knowing.
So, why not have it
with loud music?
My dad was a businessman.
I swore
I'd never become one,
but I wanted to be
independent,
so I created
a little mail-order business
in order to supply myself and other
people who had like interest in mushrooms.
When we started the business,
it was extremely difficult
back then,
and we didn't have
the resources.
We were putting
little advertisements
in Organic Gardening magazine
back when there was only
three television stations.
I invented this business
so I could buy equipment
for my laboratory wholesale.
Amazing to me,
we have nearly 100 employees
and thousands
of media outlets.
These mushrooms
were so powerful to me
that I realized
that I wanted to study them.
This mushroom that's known as
reishi, or lingzhi,
the mushroom
of immortality.
And it's one of the most amazing
and interesting mushrooms
that we've ever grown.
This mushroom helps the immunity
of not only people, but bees.
Up this hill here,
we have a quarter section
of property,
160 acres,
and we have a large
mycological experiment.
We planted 33,000 trees,
half with mycorrhizal fungi
attached to the roots,
half without,
and this is year nine.
So, we are putting into
an Excel spreadsheet,
or have put in
1,100 trees
to compare the treatments.
I came into a chunk of change
from licensing one
of my patents,
and so when the political
climate of the USA changed
to be adverse
to environmentalists,
we bought land in Canada.
I think the fact that he didn't
come up on a conventional academic pathway
is part of the reason
he's as willing
to really explore ideas
that...
are not
on anyone else's radar.
I'm really honored
that I discovered a few things
that no one else
had yet discovered.
So, I have now five patents
on entomopathogenic fungi.
These are fungi
that infect insects,
and in particular,
termites.
The biggest problem in
the commercialization
of biopesticides
from fungi
has been the spore
repellency property.
The insects avoid the spores
of these fungi.
In fact,
so concerned are termites
that if a worker goes out
and encounters this fungus,
when the worker returns back
to the nest,
guards,
they'll capture that worker
that's infected
with these spores,
take the worker
to a graveyard,
and they cut off
the worker's head,
and then the two guards
commit suicide.
They're trying to protect
the queen and the nest
and the colony
from infection.
And I discovered something
that no one else
had ever reported
in the scientific literature.
I found a biological switch
that delayed sporulation,
and then the insects
were not repelled.
But they were
super attracted,
which means one finds the fungus
now, and others follow,
and it ends up
being a Trojan horse.
The same fungi now are taken
past the guards,
given to the queen,
the queen feeds it
to the brood.
The whole colony becomes
mummified with this mycelium,
and, whoosh! The whole colony
is infected and dies.
And then the spore repellency
properties
protects your house
from subsequent invasions.
This is a huge discovery.
And then I tried it
with carpenter ants,
with fire ants,
fungus gnats,
and then mosquitoes,
and now we're working
with bed bugs,
and we've had successes
across the board.
The entire ecosystem
is infused with fungi.
So, I see these deep reservoirs
of the ecology all around us.
In a world of invention,
the answer
to our greatest problems
may be hiding right
under our feet.
There are mushrooms
that have been used
in Western medicine.
Penicillin, for example,
is a really effective
antibiotic.
Before it was synthesized,
during the Civil War,
when a soldier
would get wounded,
they would slap a piece of
moldy bread on his wound
to benefit from
those antibiotic properties,
so he wouldn't get
an infection.
Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin in 1927.
The problem was that
they couldn't find strains
that could be
commercialized,
that could produce enough
of it
in a commercially
economic fashion.
We fast forward,
and in 1942,
a group of researchers
in Chicago went shopping,
and a lab assistant found
a cantaloupe that was rotting
with a beautiful
golden mold,
and from that strain,
we got the first hyper-producing
strain of penicillium.
Penicillin literally saved
tens of thousands
of soldiers' lives.
The Brits had this,
but the Germans
and the Japanese did not.
It's been suggested
that the discovery
of this hyper-producing strain
of penicillin
was a significant influence
in winning World War II.
Alexander Fleming then received
the Nobel Prize in 1945,
in recognition
of the huge impact
that penicillin had
on human health.
Here's how medicinal
mushrooms are thought to work:
A fungus will produce
all kinds of enzymes...
it's like
a chemical warfare...
in order to fight off
competition for food,
like other microbes,
other fungi,
bacteria, virus.
That's what makes
antibiotics work.
Chemicals that are produced
by fungus,
like the one
that penicillin is made from,
the fungus produces it
to kill bacteria
that are competition,
and when we take penicillin,
it kills our bacteria.
There's a long tradition
of using mushrooms
as medicines in East Asia,
especially in Korea,
China, and Japan.
They appear
to be able to enhance
and protect the body's innate
defensive mechanisms.
The uses for them fill niches
for which we really don't have
anything in Western pharmacology.
In Western medicine,
all of our effort
is on identifying
agents of disease
and eliminating them.
That has its place,
but we do almost nothing
about supporting the good.
Shamans would treat patients
and the diseases
were thought to be
elements
of the spirit world.
Well, physicians today
treat infections,
and their spirits
are bacteria,
or a pathogenic,
or viruses.
So, whether the shamans
called them spirits
or whether the scientists
call them microbes,
with the invention
of microscopes
we get to see the microscopic
universe and landscape
that we thunder upon
with every footstep.
The fact
that these fungal networks
are seemingly invisible,
but then represent themselves
in a big flourishing mushroom
in a matter of a few days,
give us a window
into the invisible landscape
underneath our feet.
Fungal networks
have defended themselves
against vectors of disease
for millions of years.
Viral pandemics
occur periodically.
Between 1347 and 1353,
one-third
of the European population died
from
the black plague.
The great flu pandemic
of 1918,
two percent
of the world population died.
Millions upon millions
of people.
I think everyone is aware
of the threat of bioterrorism,
but few people
may know that
Europeans were actively
involved,
consciously
or unconsciously,
in bioterrorism
against indigenous peoples,
especially in the New World,
in Meso-America.
They brought in diseases,
and when you're extremely sick,
you can't fight off an invader.
It's an irony of history
that now,
the US government
is interested
in protecting people
from viral pandemics.
Paul Stamets cultured
numerous strains
in his lab,
and prepared natural extract.
He then submitted samples
to the Defense Department's
BioShield program for testing.
And ironically,
I have a debt of gratitude
to Dick Cheney
and George W. Bush.
It is vital that our nation
discuss and address the threat
of pandemic flu now.
Their funding of that research
led to some
very novel discoveries,
to which
we're still elaborating today.
And what we know about these
mycelium networks
is they're learning membranes.
They are self-learning
and network-based organisms
that can share
and store knowledge.
The mycelium
is vaccinating itself
against pathogens
in the ecosystem.
We can capitalize on this
because many
of the same bacterial pathogens
that infect fungi,
also can infect animals.
We have found novel molecules
highly active
against pox viruses,
novel molecules highly active
against HPV,
the human papillomavirus.
Many scientists are trying
to come up
with the next antibiotic,
the next penicillin,
but we have barely tapped
into the fungal genome,
especially the mushroom form
of fungi.
Think of it: our old-growth forests
that contain these ancient fungi
are deep reservoirs
of potential compounds
that can fight pandemic viruses.
We should save the old-growth forest
as a matter of national defense.
I recommend mushrooms and
mushroom products frequently to patients
and I teach other doctors
about their uses.
Mushrooms have molecules
not found elsewhere in nature.
There're some that have
totally unusual properties
like Lion's Mane mushroom.
The Lion's Mane mushroom
is a globular cascading
icicle-formed mushroom.
Tastes like lobster
or shrimp when you cook it,
but a researcher in Japan
by the name of Kara-Jishi
discovered in around 1993,
and I don't have the foggiest
idea how you discover this,
but he discovered that this
mushroom stimulates nerves to regrow
and he postulated it could be an
effective treatment against Alzheimer's.
Since we don't have
anything for Alzheimer's
and since this is nontoxic,
we should test it.
Mushrooms are
completely unusual organisms
and they're ignored
by so many people
and yet
they're a vital interface
between all forms
of life.
At the University
of Southern Florida,
a very interesting study
came out.
Mice were trained to have
a conditioned fear response
and so when there's a sound
that is associated with a pain,
later on when they just heard
the sound,
they cowered in fear.
When they treated the mice
with psilocybin,
the compound
of magic mushrooms,
the mice dissociated
that link.
The mice overcame
the fear-conditioned response.
We started with very low doses
to as high a dose
as one milligram per kilogram.
Now what was interesting,
if you look
at double-labeled cells,
in other words,
the birth of new neurons,
we saw an increase
in neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis literally means
"neuro" for nerves
and "genesis,"
rebirth or beginning of.
The regrowing of neurons.
They were not using the same neurological
pathways they have in the past.
This is really exciting
because it means that the brain
has a plasticity about it,
is able to heal,
is able to grow.
It just needs
the right compounds
to help it develop new
neurological pathways.
We're all getting older.
We'll all suffer some degree
of dementia.
What compounds can we take
that enhances and preserves
neurogenesis?
I know many, many people
who would not dare take
a psilocybin mushroom trip,
but the concept of them taking
one 50th of a dose,
something like that,
and it causes neurogenesis
that might make them smarter
or in a better mood or happier?
That's a whole different
subject.
We are on a
never-ending search for partners,
life-affirming relationships,
or at the very least,
nourishment for the next leg
of our journey.
We have flourished side by side
with your species
symbiotically
for centuries.
Many shamanic cultures
relied on mushrooms
for their transcendental
experiences.
This is pre-religion
all over the world.
It was all about
the individual's connection
to the spiritual world,
or the mystery that is
our context for living.
These are ancient artifacts
from the Mayan culture.
These are called
mushroom stones.
This may be
the largest collection
of mushroom stones
in the world.
The Mayan culture
was very mycophillic
and they revered mushroom stones
for divination,
for spirituality.
Also to be able
to predict incoming armies,
and how to strategize
against them.
A great ethnomycologist
by the name of R. Gordon Wasson
came up with the phrase
mycophilia,
the love of mushrooms
that the Mayans shared.
Mycophobia
is a classically...
the English
had a fear of mushrooms
because they're enigmatic.
You know, these mushrooms
can get you high,
they can heal you, they can feed
you, they can kill you.
And so that which is so powerful
is naturally feared.
Wasson was
an amateur mycologist,
a person
who studies mushrooms
and was invited to participate
in a ceremony by a curandera,
Maria Sabina in 1955.
He took these mushrooms
and had
a psychedelic experience...
And when R.
Gordon Wasson came out with this research
that was published
in Life magazine in 1957...
that was basically a field guide
to psilocybin mushrooms
delivered
to tens of millions of Americans
on their doorstep,
during the peak of the Cold War.
This then was quickly noticed
by academics at Harvard
and other Ivy League schools
and then the cognoscenti,
including Timothy Leary,
Ram Dass, and Dr. Andrew Weil.
Why do mushrooms
produce molecules
that fit receptors
in the human brain and body?
What does that say?
What does that mean?
I mean, does that mean that we're
supposed to be using these things?
Psychedelics during
the '50s and '60s
were the cutting edge
of psychiatric research.
There were remarkable studies
with very, very promising
findings.
Psychedelics became part of
research in psychiatry for 30 years.
and there were several very interesting
indications that they were researched.
The best data was actually
for alcoholism.
We found that having
a mystical experience
during the course
of one session
was the strongest predictor
of positive outcome,
meaning maintaining sobriety
over the long follow-up period.
It was very impressive.
Some of these drugs,
they had "escaped the lab,"
as the phrase goes.
Millions of people
were using them
and you have to realize
that this was a radical force
unleashed in the West.
The kids who take
psychedelics aren't going to fight your wars.
They're not going to join
your corporations,
they won't buy it.
A lot was
going on back in the '60s.
It was a time
of rapid cultural change.
There was irrational fears
about too much cultural change
too fast.
President Nixon
called Timothy Leary
the most dangerous man
in America.
We must wage what I have called
total war
against public enemy number one
in the United States,
the problem
with dangerous drugs.
When everyone says
"shrooms" to me,
it invokes this whole idea
of using psilocybin mushrooms
as a party drug,
They are so much more important
than just getting high.
The movement to marginalize
the major psychedelics
is incredibly complex.
I mean, it plugged into
a counterculture movement,
an anti-war movement,
an anti-establishment movement.
There are many, many forces
that were at play.
Somehow the fuse blew
and one of the victims was
the medical research
with psychedelics.
There was a very irrational
and anti-scientific climate
that was fueled even
in government pamphlets,
really had
distorted information
that was not scientifically
accurate.
It was a bad trip,
instant insanity.
The research came
to a halt in 1970.
War was declared on drugs.
The Controlled Substances Act
was passed
and the research essentially
was erased
from being taught
in psychiatry.
I think I may have the
dubious distinction of being the last
to give psilocybin
to a cancer patient
at the Maryland
Psychiatric Research Center.
And then the research
became completely dormant.
In our evolution
as a species,
we're at a point
of coming to terms
with a major paradigm change.
A change in how we view
what we call reality.
And that always evokes
tension and fears.
The culture wants to cling
to the old view of the universe.
You realize that
you've been limited all this time
with your perspective
of reality.
Had reality been known to you
at this level early on,
how much more evolved
would we be as beings?
A lot of people would be afraid
of that.
This is very dangerous
territory.
People want to give up the responsibility
of being able to understand
and because they can't
understand, then they have faith.
and they put their faith in other
people who say they can understand.
And I think it's a situation
that is ripe
for a predatory relationship.
Anyone who's had one
of those experiences
in a country where
it's not legal to have them
is stuck in this position
where something
really precious...
and really giving
a great gift to you
is not understood
by the culture at large
and furthermore, puts you or
other people or/and other people
at risk of prosecution.
And one response to that
is to get angry,
and to want to fight that.
And another response to it
is to say,
We've just got to explain
to people what's going on here.
And when people understand it,
then there will be accommodation
and respect.
There are a number of elders
living in the Bay Area
who've devoted some part
of their career
in psychology
or religious studies
who ended up being invited
to a small invitational
conference at Esalen
called the Pacific Symposium
on Psychedelic Drugs.
As we went around the room
making introductions,
most of the people who were
clinicians
were excitedly talking about
what kind of clinical trial
they would run
if they could use one
of these substances
to treat PTSD...
or to treat
depression.
We wrote
the best design we could.
We submitted it to the FDA
and they approved it.
This was 1999,
and it reactivated
psychedelic research
after basically a 22-year
dormancy in the United States.
It's like
a Rip Van Winkle effect.
You know,
it's waking up 20 years later.
The methodologies,
the questions that we can ask
on so many different levels.
I had been diagnosed
with prostate cancer.
My diagnosis was so bad
that...
You know, they weren't giving me
any chance whatsoever.
My diagnosis
was kidney cancer.
Finding out that you may want
to get your affairs in order.
I first found out
about the study
when my oncologist gave me
a pamphlet.
He said, "Here's something that might
be able to help you with the anxiety."
And I was accepted
into the study.
The most important thing
is to remember
that you're always safe.
And a recommendation is
that whatever is coming up,
that you allow it,
that you don't have to like it,
but you say okay,
rather than trying
to run away from it.
Once a volunteer is enrolled
in the study,
they're with us
for the preparation,
the psilocybin sessions
and the integration follow-ups
after.
I have been a guide for
around 350 psilocybin sessions
and then about a thousand
of the preparatory
and integration meetings.
Alright.
Okay, lift your head up.
It's really just about
experiencing what comes up
as the psilocybin takes effect.
In the intense part
of this journey,
this world and things
that matter to most people,
family and all that,
that wasn't even
what it was about.
They say anything mystical
can't be explained.
It's something like that.
It's a feeling
of such immense power
that you can't even imagine.
I've never felt
anything like it before.
It was about being in a place
of infinite space
and just being there.
There's a
experience of positive mood,
sometimes openheartedness,
love,
a transcendence
of time and space,
and then finally,
it's thought to be ineffable.
People say, "I can't describe
that experience."
In my mind I said,
"Okay, hold it.
If I give myself over to you...
can you promise me
that I will be in at least
as strong a shape
as when I entered this room?"
And I felt a voice
that I needed to heed.
"Do you think I would
disrespect my own handiwork?"
This is the voice
from on high saying,
"Do you think I would
disrespect my child?"
And I felt so beautiful.
I felt
like I have never felt before.
My sense of being loved,
of being worthy of love,
of being cared for,
of being important
to someone.
It's huge.
You're going into it,
you're doing beautifully.
One-third
of individuals in the study
said it's the single most
spiritually significant
experience of their lives.
About 70% say
it's among the five most personally
meaningful experiences of their lives.
Then you say,
"Well, so what does that mean?"
You know?
And initially I thought,
I wonder if they don't have
pretty dull lives.
But no,
people would say,
you know, when my firstborn came
into this world,
I'll never forget that.
And life has never
been the same since.
Or my father passed away.
That was deeply moving to me.
I'm different now
in the world.
They say, you know,
it's kind of like that.
The most glorious part
was that
it made me feel more comfortable
with living,
you know,
because, uh...
you're not afraid of dying.
Frankly,
I'm just a laboratory scientist
and I wasn't prepared for that.
From the memory of the
transcendental state of consciousness,
many people report less anxiety,
less depression,
less preoccupation
with pain,
closer interpersonal
relationships,
and perhaps most impressive,
they claim to have a loss
of the fear of death.
It recalibrates
how they see death.
It's been amazing
hearing them talk about this idea of love.
Many of them spoke about
how nature itself
is something like
this substance called love.
And having touched that,
They've recalibrated and reshaped
how they die differently.
The Johns Hopkins
psilocybin research team
has completed or has underway
a total of nine studies
and it got
the world's attention.
When we finally released the
results of our first experiment
in a peer-reviewed
scientific journal,
it was very gratifying to see
how the daily press responded
to it.
A little bit of health news
for you.
A single dose of psychedelic
magic mushrooms
can make people with severe
anxiety and depression
feel better
for months.
It changes the way
they view themselves,
other people in the world...
from a single experience,
not Prozac that you have
to keep taking day after day.
These are not chronic drugs,
and that's where most
of the research
and development
in Big Pharma goes.
The treatments that are
being explored for psilocybin
involve one, two,
maybe three pills.
That's it.
That's not a very good
business model.
You can't make
a lot of money that way.
The core of this mystical
experience is, um...
is a mystery,
frankly.
It's the existential mystery
of what are we really
doing here?
What's the meaning
of all this?
and that is a very uplifting
kind of experience to have.
As a whole,
there's a sense of being part
of a larger network.
And somehow, that's more real
after a mystical experience.
You feel
that you really are connected
in some meaningful way
with every atom
of the universe.
From my perspective,
this core experience then forms
all of the religious, ethical
and moral traditions.
I mean, that is the core of
"Love thy neighbor as thyself."
If we don't get some
of these priorities straight
with respect
to how we treat other people,
how we treat our environment,
we're going to cease
to exist.
I could see this
as being critical
to the evolution
of the species, frankly.
You wouldn't go
hiking the Himalaya mountains
without any preparation.
Well, this is a journey.
These are sacraments
and medicines
that should be treated
with respect
and caution.
Consider it to be going
to your own personal church.
You're going to sit
in awe of the universe.
We have a new study,
which is kind of remarkable.
It's work
with religious leaders.
These are ordained clergy
who have many traditions.
Christianity, Buddhism,
Judaism, Hinduism.
Since these experiences are
at the core
of the major
religions,
why not bring in
religious leaders
who spent their careers
studying this landscape
to have the experience?
You guys hear that?
- You didn't?
- Vibrating?
Vibrating.
Phone call was coming in.
There she goes.
Message from Mom.
Inbound message
from Mother.
I think
I had the best of all mothers.
My mother was extremely kind.
So another mushroom
empowers the immune system
and this is turkey tails.
and turkey tail mushrooms
have also been used
for more than a thousand years.
This hit home to me very
personally, in June of 2009
when my 84-year-old mother
called me up
and said, "Paul,
I have something very serious
to talk to you about."
She said, "My right breast is
five times the size of my left.
I have six swollen lymph glands
the size of walnuts,"
and her voice started shaking
and I'm not ashamed to admit
that I started crying.
She had stage four
breast cancer.
But then the doctor said,
"You know,
you're too old
to have radiation therapy.
You can't have
your breasts removed.
But there's an interesting study
on turkey tail mushrooms
at Bastyr Medical School.
You might want
to try taking those."
And that's when my buddy goes,
"Well, my son's
supplying those."
So she was put on Taxol
and Herceptin, wonderful drugs.
And then she started taking
eight turkey tail capsules
a day.
Four in the morning
and four in the evening,
and that was in June of 2009.
And today, my mother
has no detectable tumors.
And I'd like
to bring my mother up.
You have to live through it
to believe it.
Hey, by the way, thank you
for giving birth to me.
I really appreciate that.
Oh, you haven't
thanked me lately?
It has been
reported in literature that
medicinal mushrooms
like turkey tail
help chemotherapeutic agents
work better.
And I think
she's a living example of that.
One can argue with me
on the statistics,
but my mother's alive,
and all the doctors
that saw her
did not believe
that she would survive.
It is my great honor...
to introduce Paul Stamets.
I have brought
a fungal friend of mine
from the old-growth forest
and I present to you...
agarikon.
Agarikon was described
in 65 A.D.
as elixirium ad longam vitam.
The elixir of long life.
So I want to take you
on a magical mushroom
mystery tour.
and I'm going to push
the envelope here, folks.
Microdiversity
is biodiversity.
You will decompose.
I'm going to decompose.
We're all going to die.
That's okay,
because we will enter
into the micro-verse.
We will forever exist together
within
the micromolecular matrix.
When he talks the way he does,
he is...
channeling the mycelium.
And this is a marvelous thing.
Brain neurons,
mycelium,
the computer internet,
the organization of the universe
all shares the same archetype.
I believe
matter begets life.
Life becomes single cells.
Single cells
form chains.
Chains forms branches.
Matrices form interlocking,
intercepting mosaics of mycelium
and mycelium-like organisms
ebb and flow
not only on this planet,
on other planets
into the future.
Thank you very much.
Paul was wonderful
in bringing us information
about all these
aspects of mushrooms
and that it inspired
all these young people.
Now we have people
like Tradd Cotter
carrying on the great work
that Paul started,
talking about biopesticides,
talking about the ways
you could detoxify oil.
All of these amazing things
were started
because people like Paul
brought that
to the culture at large
and young people now
have taken up the cause
and are really expanding
our insights
into what the world of mushrooms
can do for us.
Hi, my name's Peter
and I'm with the radical
mycology project.
I recently trained a mushroom
to digest
used cigarette filters.
Paul Stamets's book
Mycelium Running
got my mind sort of in a whirl.
That was when I first discovered
that
there was much more to mushrooms
than just food.
If you would have seen me
when I dropped out
of high school,
I was just making
rap music.
I knew very little
about the natural world.
I had never even went
on a hike until I was 18,
but finding Paul Stamets's
TED talk video
was one of the biggest
inspirations that pushed me
into the wonderful world
of mycology.
My first mushroom book
was The Mushroom Cultivator
by Paul Stamets.
I will be eternally thankful
to him
for showing me that it's okay
to be mushroom mad.
We really don't
even know most fungi.
We're discovering new species
on a daily basis
and you don't have to go
to exotic locations
to discover them.
Anybody can add to the science,
from identifying a new species
to developing
a new micro-mediation protocol.
There is a great need
for more people to study fungi
and there's lots
of opportunities.
It's amazing what
we don't know about mushrooms.
They really are a frontier
of knowledge.
They probably can help us
solve all sorts of problems
if we look a little deeper.
Anyone, anyone can help
by going and walking
in the woods
and contributing
to mycology.
You may have found a species
that has never been found.
We need these mushrooms.
We work together as a community
to solve problems.
We could be the community
that heals the planet.
It's been estimated
two-thirds of our food supply
is bee-pollinated-dependent.
Unfortunately, we're losing bees
across the world
in a dramatic die-off
that is very dangerous
for the biosecurity
of this planet.
So I started exploring ways
to help save the bees
and I noticed
in the summertime
there's a continuous convoy
of bees
going from my beehives
to my mycelium.
But then it dawned on me,
maybe the bees are benefiting
from the mycelial extracts
because they have
antiviral properties.
And so I cultured the most
aggressive strains
and then submitted them.
We started testing the effects
of these extracts
in helping bees survive.
Some of these
fungal extracts are really good
at reducing viral levels
in the bee.
So here we have a fungus
that is helping fight viruses
in an insect.
We're using mushrooms
to create
an entirely new class
of materials
which are totally compostable
at the end of their lives.
The researchers found that
when they heated
a portobello mushroom skin
to roughly 2,000 degrees
Fahrenheit,
it became a lattice
of carbon nano ribbon
that could be used
in battery design
because it allows a good amount
of surface area
for storing energy.
You can filter water.
You can create medicinal
compounds almost on demand.
We've worked in Haiti,
and they look at you
like I have super powers.
Well, I tell them, I said,
"You are about
to have superpowers too."
Coming from the background
of not having any training,
getting myself into the lab
was very empowering.
I felt like a superhero.
I felt like I could do anything.
You're officially
a mushroom farmer.
Sporulating.
Sporgasm.
I see my species
as part of a larger whole.
Rather than being at the top
of the pyramid,
being one of the organisms
with inside the circle.
and the circle
is made up of mycelium,
holding us all together.
We've always thought of
plants as these inert objects,
these things that don't actually
interact with each other
and build things,
and what my work is showing,
and other people's work as well,
it's saying actually,
they need each other.
They need each other
to grow in a community
so that they can start sharing
the load.
You do this, I'll do that,
and together,
we can make a beautiful
resilient community.
They have incredible capacity
to make things change
very, very quickly.
So if we can work with them,
if we get it, you know?
If humans get it,
we can change this thing
really fast.
So I am super hopeful.
We just got to get busy
and help nature do its thing.
Evolution never stops.
There's not one point
that it happens
and then
it doesn't happen again.
It's continuously happening.
The core concept of evolution
is that
through natural selection,
the strongest
and the fittest survive.
But moreover,
communities survive better
than individuals.
Communities rely
upon cooperation,
and I think
that's the power of goodness.
Evolution is based
on the concept
of mutual benefit,
and the extension
of generosity.
When we see it,
we understand it.
And when we understand it,
we care about it.
And when we care about it,
we'll do something
to help save it.
We need to have a paradigm shift
in our consciousness.
What will it take
to achieve that?
We are not an individual.
We are a vast network
of molecules
and energies and wavelengths.
The interconnectedness of being
is who we are.
This world of ours
is always changing,
not for the better
or for the worse,
but for life.
If the storms come
and the water rises,
if fire scorches the land,
or darkness descends,
we will be here
working,
as we always have.
Extending the network.
Building community.
Restoring balance.
One connection at a time.
It may take a million years,
or a hundred million,
but we will still be here.
Lieutenant Paul Stamets.
I became an astral mycologist
because of awe.
Awe at the miracle of life.
How did you feel
seeing a fictional
character on Star Trek
that is inspired
by your science?
I'm super honored.
I tuned into Star Trek
when I was about 12 years old.
Spores by their nature
travel through the cosmos.
When they germinate,
some mushrooms form.
Some magic mushrooms help you
bend time and space.
So, uh,
if I were to visit you...
could we have some
of these magic mushrooms?
Nature provides.
I don't.
