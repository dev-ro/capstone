Martin.
Come on, we're on.
How do you get by
with so little sleep?
Ambition, good diet.
Constant self-medication.
Time you got a new bag?
I got this from
a friend of the family.
- It used to be his.
- Oh, well, in that case...
I kinda like it.
You going to that thing
for the new residents?
I don't know.
Carson's daughter's gonna be there.
Who's Carson?
Radiology.
Supposedly his daughter's
a real peach.
Come on, Martin,
Time to start looking
for that trophy wife.
Bring the bag.
Dr. Levy, 4152.
How are you...
Mr. Sanchez?
No Hablo Ingles.
Oh.
- No Hablo Espanol.
- Doctor,
Excuse me one... On moment.
Por favor, doctor...
Dr. Page?
Do you speak Spanish?
No.
Can you cough?
Thank you.
Okay, you need a lot of rest.
Rest. Sleep.
You need to rest.
- Yes.
That's what you need. Okay?
The barium pictures were negative.
Why the D-Xyclose
absorption series?
I felt I should rule out
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
Whipple's disease, and celiac.
I say mild peptic ulcer.
I mean, possible chronic reflux.
Smokes, drinks...
filed for divorce.
I didn't know about the divorce.
Did you talk to her?
Not about stuff like that.
We're not fishing
for syndromes here, folks.
Communication is key.
- Dr. Waylans.
- Yes?
Ah. Martin...Blake.
Things going okay?
Yeah. I was wondering,
You did the infectious
diseases fellowship?
Yeah.
Well, I'm applying.
Do you have any advice?
You're only six days
into residency.
You can't even apply
till next year.
I just want to be prepared.
Oh. Well, it's not much.
You know, a good candidate
is just a good doctor.
Right.
You do know the secret
to being a good doctor,
Don't you, Martin?
You act like one.
I do, I think.
Well, then, you're fine.
- Dr. Waylans?
- Yes, Martin?
Is it possible to get
our I.D. Picture retaken?
I have no idea.
Excuse me, what does that say?
Penicillin.
Excuse me, when will
the doctor be here?
I am the doctor.
Okay, that's it for now.
Nurse?
I'll need labs drawn.
You're gonna have to
do it yourself... We're swamped.
You know how, right?
Yes. Of course. Thank you.
Is that okay?
Sorry. A phlebotomist
is supposed to do this.
A what?
It's who draws the blood.
Doctors aren't supposed
to have to do this.
There you go.
Okay.
Here you are.
I'm so sorry, I thought
you were someone else.
Who did you think I was?
I see you've met
my esteemed colleague.
I did.
For a minute,
I thought he was you.
There's only one of me.
That's the rule.
This is Martin.
Martin, this is Christine.
- Hi.
- Dr. Carson's daughter.
So back to you being such
a big nerd in high school.
- The biggest.
- Really?
Yep. And then
one day I realized
I was gonna die a virgin.
That thought can come as quite
a shock to a young man.
Don't you have some
other rooms to attend to?
Let's just be a couple dirty
Mexicans and make it happen.
Make what happen?
How 'bout I just talk to you?
Let's make ourselves useful.
Jimmy, come on.
Yo.
Good morning, doc.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Bad.
What's wrong with me again?
Pyelonephritis.
It's a UTI of the upper tract
and kidney.
Pie-Lo-Na-Fry-Tis.
Like that?
Pyelonephritis.
Mm-Hmm.
Sit up.
Okay...
are you sore there?
- Yeah.
Here?
Yeah.
Pyelonephritis.
Can you die from that?
Maybe, if you never
took care of it.
But that's what us doctors
are here for.
I thought you guys
just played golf.
I don't know how to play golf.
I thought all doctors
played golf.
I'm gonna learn.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Doctor, nice to see you again.
How's she doing?
Good. Responding to
antibiotics.
I could've died...right?
I was just saying
it can be serious.
But it's completely
under control.
So you mean, like,
if this were before hospitals,
She'd be dead?
I didn't say that.
It's amazing knowing how
to save people like that.
I bet you even know
the name of this.
Philtrum.
See, I told you he'd know it.
Hi.
- Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hey, Mrs. Nixon. Val.
This is my doctor.
He said I could have died.
- Dr. Blake.
Hey.
So...how's it going?
Okay.
You able to walk or...
I'll look in again later on.
You got, like,
some kind of infection?
This says "penicillin," right?
Yeah.
Come with me, please.
Mr. Sanchez is allergic
to penicillin.
Well, it didn't say so
on the...
This isn't the original admit
sheet... Where's the original?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
On the original sheet, it said
"NKA," no known allergies.
- Well, did you ask him?
- He doesn't speak English.
If you knew he was allergic,
why'd you give him penicillin?
Because you're the doctor.
I only do what you say.
Okay, let's get
a Benadryl line...
Already took care of it.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
To file an incident report.
A what? Why?
This is an incident.
It's procedure.
And can you rewrite this
legibly?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for
the original admit sheet.
I'm sorry, doctor,
But whatever it is
you're looking for,
You're not gonna find it there.
Here you go, T.
Little present for you.
Marty!
This seat taken?
Look, right, right, right...
Look, look, look, look.
Hey, Nancy,
You want to sit down,
right here?
So that's a no.
Have a good weekend.
Excuse me.
Excuse me a second.
- No problem.
Dr. Waylans, can I talk
to you for a second?
Sure.
I just wanted to ask you
about incident reports.
Is this about
the Sanchez thing?
I wouldn't worry about it.
But does it go on my record?
I mean, is it bad?
I don't think so.
I mean, it's not good.
Will it affect my application
For the infectious diseases
fellowship?
I can't undo it,
if that's what you mean.
I haven't heard that before.
No, that's fine. Perfect.
While you're at it,
why don't you just go screw her
And get it over with?
No. Because I'm sick,
and I'm in the hospital,
If you haven't noticed.
Oh, please.
You're such an asshole!
Go to hell.
I'm getting better.
It looks that way.
Everything okay?
Do you remember Rich?
I should break up with him.
You think I should
break up with him?
That's none of my business.
He is the most popular guy
in school.
I wasn't the most popular guy
in school.
And now I'm a doctor.
What do you think Rich
is going to be?
I don't know.
An idiot.
It's hard to dump him, though.
We've been together
for a while.
I mean, I don't know
if we're in love or anything.
- Well, you know what they say.
- What?
If you love someone...
set them free.
Who says that?
Sting.
I think.
Who?
Excuse me, doctor.
I'm with a patient.
I can't do these orders
until I can read them.
I can't do these orders...
press "door open".
Press "door open"!
Hello, doctor.
Having a rough day, are we?
No. Fine.
Don't worry, I got it too.
Every goddamn day's
a shit fight
Just to get out of bed
in the morning.
Oh.
What's bugging you, doc?
This is a hospital.
The staff is supposed
to follow orders, right?
Isn't that how
it's supposed to be?
Doctors get a little respect?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe.
It's probably not
what you think, though.
I just want things to be
like they're supposed to be.
How long has Theresa been here?
Didn't you learn how
to get rid of people like that
In med school?
Just slip 'em something,
Then they're going along,
and then bam!
Heart attack! Too bad.
I'm kidding, doc.
Just, uh...bet you were
thinking about it.
Okay, I'm clocking out.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay, I guess.
What was the deal
with that nurse?
It was a misunderstanding.
It's okay.
Shouldn't she be fired
or something
For yelling at a doctor?
Probably.
I don't want to cause a fuss.
Am I cured?
Nearly.
No more hospital?
No.
No more helpful advice?
I'll tell nurse Ratched
you're a good doctor.
Maybe she'll leave you alone.
Thanks.
You're a good patient.
Ah, Nixon.
Signs are okay.
No pain, no spikes.
She's outta here.
Just another day, to be sure?
I already signed her out.
Let's move on.
Mr. Sanchez...
Hi.
Are you Diane's doctor?
- Yes.
- I'm Diane's father.
Thank you for everything.
I was just coming
to say good-Bye.
My wife just took her
down to the car.
Any last-Minute advice?
Finish her pills.
She could relapse.
Okay, we'll do that.
Uh, I don't know
how to say this,
But my daughter took
quite a shine to you.
She thought you two
got on pretty well,
And she wondered if
I might ask you over
For dinner on Friday.
Friday. Yes.
That'd be nice.
- Great.
- Friday.
We'll count on it.
See you then.
8:00 Friday.
Diane, you feeling better?
How are you feeling?
Mr. Nixon, Mrs. Nixon.
- Is that the doctor?
- Uh, yeah.
- Let him in.
- Hi. Hi. Come on in.
Welcome to our home.
Oh, you remember Valerie,
right?
Hi.
I love your jacket.
Thanks.
And this is our youngest,
Donny.
- Hello.
- What's up?
- Not much.
- Please sit down.
Where's Diane?
Oh, she's out.
I told her to stay...
so that she didn't seem
ungrateful...
because we really are.
But...she's having a talk
with Rich.
So what's it like
being a doctor?
A lot of work.
A lot of responsibility.
But I like it.
How many operations
you do a week?
I'm in internal medicine.
What's that, like, intestines?
Donny, not at the table.
That'd be great. Get in there
and just dig around.
I don't do surgery.
I bet it pays pretty well,
doesn't it, being a doctor?
Donny, don't pry.
It's actually less
than you think,
But it's a lot more
than I'd make back home.
And he makes more
than you do, Donny.
Besides,
the money comes when you go
Into private practice, right?
You got a nice place?
It's okay.
The beach.
Oh, I love the beach.
You're so lucky.
I wish I lived by the beach
And knew all this
incredible knowledge
About the human body.
You know plenty.
Donny, you pig!
Stop...
- Valerie!
- Mom!
He started it.
Mom, this was brand-New.
You're just gonna get sperm
on it anyway.
Let's not have that kind
of language
At the table there, guy.
Honestly, Donny.
I am so sorry, doctor.
It's okay.
Could I use your restroom?
- Certainly.
It's down the hall
on the right.
Excuse me.
What, mom?
He's a doctor.
It's not like he's never
heard of sperm before.
- Hey!
- You are upsetting your father.
Where do you come up
with this stuff?
Oh!
Sorry.
It's just something
came up at the hospital,
And I really have to go.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
Okay, that's it.
Have a good day, everyone.
Thanks.
I'll see you there.
Blake, can you stay
for a second, please?
Sure.
Have a seat.
So...how's it going?
Fine.
Oh, yeah? Tired?
A little.
Happy?
Want some coffee?
No, thanks.
First year of residency
can be tough, I know.
If this is about
Mr. Sanchez...
I just wanted to chat
about the big picture.
Tell me something, Martin...
When did you first want
to become a doctor?
When?
- Yeah.
- A long time ago, I guess.
Did you know why?
Why? Because...
a friend of my mother's
was a doctor,
And he was respected,
And I guess I just always
thought, you know,
To have that respect, and to...
and be helping people.
Yeah, people go into medicine
for all kinds of reasons.
You know, sometimes
they don't really think about it
Till they're here,
face-To-Face with it all.
And sometimes they realize
the stress and the hours
And the nature of the work
Aren't what they thought
it would be.
I mean, it's not unusual
for people to realize
Maybe this isn't what
they wanted after all.
This is what I want.
I mean, I know I can do better.
It's just taking time for me
to learn your system here.
I mean, I didn't have
all the advantages, you know,
Growing up and school,
and so sometimes
I just have to work harder,
and I do.
Some of the nurses, I mean...
Maryanne's fine,
but with Theresa...
I double-Majored
in chemistry and biology.
I went to school,
I did all this work,
And she just treats me
like I'm some nobody.
It doesn't seem fair, but...
I do want this.
There you go.
- Thanks.
Hi, Martin, it's Valerie Nixon.
It was really nice to see you
the other night.
I'm sorry you had to rush off.
My mom actually got you
a gift basket,
But we forgot
to give it to you.
So I don't know if you wanted
to arrange a time
To come by and get it,
Or I could drop it by
the hospital...
or your apartment, if you like.
So give us a call.
I'm home any time but tonight.
Okay, bye.
Oh, dr. Blake, come in.
Thank you.
Can I get you some coffee
or anything?
No thanks.
Valerie called.
She mentioned there was
something for me to collect?
Yeah.
But I'm expected
at the hospital.
Oh, of course.
Could I use your restroom?
Certainly.
You remember where it was?
- Yeah.
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
It's just a little something
to say thanks.
Thanks again, doctor.
Any special instructions
for Diane?
Just finish her medicine.
I thought it was just malaise
From hanging around
the house so much.
- I told you,
it's Pyelonephritis.
Ow.
I thought she was all better.
It did seem that way.
We'll run some tests
to make sure.
But there are some
resistant strains
That are harder to treat.
Hey, doc!
Hey, it's nice to have
the little number back
In 324, huh?
I don't think it's appropriate
To talk about the patients
in that manner.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hippocratichyppocratic
oath, right? Yeah.
I need a cam profile.
- We need the ultrasound.
- Get it from...
- There's one here.
- All right.
Who's the primary doctor?
Where's the chart?
What is this?
This doesn't make sense.
Another allergic
reaction, doctor?
No.
This is something else.
See? Vancomycin.
Not a penicillin reaction.
It wasn't my mistake.
Yeah, looks like
red man syndrome.
Well, that can happen when...
When someone misadministers
Vancomycin.
Which doesn't surprise me
Because I never thought that
Theresa, beyond her attitude,
Was all that sharp
about these things.
Well, I'll look into it.
How's everything else?
I see the Nixon girl is back?
Yeah. She said she took
her oral meds.
But I'll do a resistance culture
just to be sure.
All right.
Keep up the good work.
So...
can't keep away.
It seems that way.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
You don't want to
go back to school?
Rich?
The medicine you're on now
is much stronger.
You'll get better very soon.
Do I have to?
Ooh!
Oh, I'm really so sorry,
doctor.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
Maryanne, I'm really busy...
You know what, um...
they just let me go.
And before you hear it
from anyone else,
I messed up
Mr. Sanchez's Vancomycin.
I switched the sheet,
and I just panicked.
I'm just sorry
if I jeopardized a patient.
I thought it was Theresa.
No. She didn't know
anything about it.
Oh...
so sorry to hold you up.
It's fine.
Excuse me.
Sorry, doctor.
Good morning.
How are you feeling?
- The same, I guess.
Your temperature's up a little.
Is that bad?
It's nothing serious,
But you might have to stay
an extra day or two.
Is that bad?
No. That's fine.
Once you check in on me.
- Someone's coming.
- What are you talking about?
Oh, hey, doc.
Uh...
- Get off me.
We were just talking.
Is this woman under sedation?
It's cool, man.
It's just a party, man.
Shit, it was her idea anyway.
Mandy, tell the doctor
you're okay.
Doctor, I'm okay.
What are you doing
down here, doc?
Is there something
I could help you with?
Just get her out of here.
All right, let's get you
back to bed now, Mandy.
Mm-Hmm.
Nice work, doc.
Son of a bitch.
Weren't you off at midnight?
Yes. I just had
some things to finish.
This patient's been
a difficult case.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Why don't you go home, doctor.
My biggest concern
would be an abscess
Or some kind of resistant
bacterial strain.
An abscess is doubtful.
Keep your eye
on the resistance culture.
We are seeing
more resistance in these.
I was gonna start her
on Ceftazidime.
Well, if she doesn't
start stabilizing,
We're gonna have to move her
to ICU.
And keep an eye out for sepsis.
How often are you
checking signs?
- Two hours.
- Okay. Good.
Let me know what
the resistance culture says.
I will.
What does that mean?
Your infection
might be a little tougher
Than we thought.
We're starting you
on another antibiotic,
And we need to make sure that
you're not developing sepsis.
What's that?
An intravascular infection.
An intra what?
It's in the bloodstream.
Is that serious?
It can be.
I didn't think doctors
had to do that.
I don't mind.
If I have an operation,
will you operate on me?
I don't operate.
Hmm.
I don't want to
cut into people.
That's why I went
into internal medicine.
If I do my job right,
We never have to go in at all.
I don't want to talk to him.
Well, don't...
think about it too much.
You need rest.
I know.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm, uh,
looking for Diane Nixon.
I'm afraid
she can't take visitors.
Look, man,
we had this big bust-Up.
I just need to see her
for two minutes.
It's not a good idea.
Just leave her alone
for a little while.
She needs rest.
Give this to her.
Sure.
You should be sleeping.
I can't.
What did the expert say?
He said it's a difficult case,
But we're gonna
work together on it,
And everything's gonna be okay.
There's something
I didn't tell you...
about before I came back
to the hospital.
I don't know if it's what could
have made me get sick again.
What's that?
I had sex with Rich
before I finished my medication.
That can upset
your urinary tract, right?
I don't think
that's what did it.
I didn't think
you two were goin' out anymore.
You know how sometimes you do
things you know you shouldn't,
But you just can't help it?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna die, am I?
No, of course not.
I always thought if I was
gonna die, I wanted to, like,
Get shot stopping a crime,
or something.
I know that's stupid.
Do you ever think about
stuff like that?
When I was younger, maybe.
It's silly.
What did you imagine?
I would think about
just walking into the ocean,
And just disappearing,
like I never existed,
And the world would just
go on without me.
I love the ocean.
I'm not sure I've seen
anything quite like this.
Yeah, it's, uh,
been a tough case.
They had an Acinetobacter
at south east general,
But I've never seen one of these
so resistant before.
You've been doing
regular cultures
To check against some other bug,
maybe some nosocomial thing?
I considered that,
But nothing's
come up in cultures.
Martin's been very thorough.
He's done everything
I would have done.
And she's been
properly administered all along?
Yes.
Well, Martin, it looks like
You've landed yourself
a tricky one.
I drew up the protocol
to treat the sepsis...
Shoot.
I must have left it in my car.
I'm due upstairs.
Would you mind?
No. No, I was
just about to grab lunch.
Silver Mercedes,
Johns Hopkins stickers.
And it's in the back.
It's a tube
that goes into your heart.
It doesn't hurt.
So you can look in
any time you want?
Yeah.
If you had one, too,
we could have a heart-To-Heart.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Just kind of groggy.
They put pain medicine
into your I.V.
Any pain from the catheter?
No. It's weird.
I feel kinda nice, actually.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
You're not married or don't
have a girlfriend or anything.
What's the question?
Why not?
You know how people are
in the world.
Yeah.
You know, for a while
I thought you liked my sister.
No.
Good, she's a slut.
You don't want a girl like that.
Doctor.
I know, I did it myself...
Where is she?
Excuse me.
Who?
Diane...Nixon.
Oh, they took her
for an M.R.I.
I just got a code four.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Where is she?
- Charge.
- Clear!
- clear!
- Clear!
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it. Call it.
Dr. Blake?
Dr. Blake?
Yes?
Sorry about yesterday,
the Nixon girl.
She seemed nice.
She was.
Thank you.
Dr. Blake?
Yes?
Dr. Waylans
would like to see you
In conference room three.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Martin.
Take a seat.
This the first time
this has happened?
Yes.
I never meant it to happen,
it just...
got out of control.
Well,
this is Dr. Sayler.
She's a psychiatrist
on staff here.
Hello, Martin.
It's always hard
to lose a patient,
Especially the first time.
You always question yourself.
You wonder if you made mistakes,
if you missed something,
Could you have been quicker?
These things happen.
Accepting that
is part of being a doctor.
If there's anything
you want to express,
Please don't hold back.
Can I ask you a question?
Okay.
Did you cry yesterday?
I did, yes.
Good.
That's good.
Oh, Mr. Nixon,
I am so sorr...
Just want to talk
to the doctor.
You killed my little girl.
Okay, Mr. Nixon,
I am truly sorry for your loss,
But you cannot come onto my ward
and start accusing my doctors.
That bastard killed
my daughter.
- Okay.
- What is the problem, sir?
She was fine,
then she came in here,
And you killed her.
- Martin, let me handle this.
Sir, these infections can be
very difficult to treat.
It was a rare,
resistant strain.
Now, if she didn't take
every one of her pills,
That could strengthen
the infection... We don't know.
She took her pills.
She told me.
Don't blame dr. Blake, sir.
I supervised him
Through the entire case.
He was exemplary in every way.
We did everything we could,
Everything, all of us.
Sir, can you come with me,
please?
Sir.
- Get your hands off me.
You bastards.
Is the situation under control,
Or do you need backup?
Everything's fine.
We're comin' out.
I'm sorry, Martin.
You shouldn't have to
deal with that.
It's a tough one.
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Waylans told me
You're not really a doctor
until you've lost a patient.
You got your scrubs.
Hey, hold up.
Goin' to X-Ray,
Mr. Granger?
There's no hearing aid.
Right, Mr. Granger,
you crazy, old fucker?
So it must be a relief
to get onto that new rotation.
Sounds like that last one
was pretty rough.
These things happen,
unfortunately.
It's part of being a doctor,
dealing with loss.
Oh.
So I guess you're a doctor now.
I suppose so.
You know what I always thought
would be the best part
About being a doctor?
It's the ladies.
The ladies love a doctor.
You find that to be true?
I suppose so, yes.
No.
What do you mean?
Meet me in the east tower
basement, five minutes.
- Why?
- I think you know.
What is it?
Well, doctor, I just wanted to
ask you an ethical question
About the relations
between staff and patients.
That woman in the supply room?
Forget about it.
No, no, no, no,
that's not my question.
See, I'm more interested
in a situation like this.
All right, say a guy like me,
You know, who likes to party,
But otherwise is a regular guy,
like an orderly,
One day, he's takin' this gurney
to change it out...
Oh, and the previous tenant
was this girl,
It was a sweet girl,
she just passed away.
Anyway, this guy's
takin' out the mattress,
And to his surprise,
Finds a little book
under there,
And, well, there's some
really shocking stuff in there
About this one young doctor.
Seems they had kind of a little,
special relationship goin' on.
Now my question is this,
do you think it's wrong,
Ethically, for this orderly
To keep this book
from his superiors?
Let's take a ride.
Another reason
I wish I was a doctor
Is so I could prescribe myself
a better time.
I party, and nobody sees this.
I can't do that.
Where there's a will,
there's a way, right?
Ahem, doctor?
Uh, I had a question
about this order.
Is it my handwriting?
Uh, no, I can read it,
it's just,
You prescribed Oxycodone
for Mr. Granger?
He's had some pain from
the Hickman catheter, so yeah.
Okay, sorry,
I just wanted to check.
Do you need help?
No, thanks.
W- What's troubling you?
What?
That's for stomachs,
And that stuff's more for,
like, sniffling and sneezing.
I know.
I'm a doctor.
Okay, sorry.
Dude, four?
They're hard to get.
I hope this is a down payment.
Okay, fine.
What about the book?
What about it?
When do I get it back?
You never had it.
I'm not gonna do this
indefinitely.
I don't think you have
much of a choice, doctor.
Time you switched to decaf?
Mmm.
Cheers.
Rotation wasn't so tough.
And they say
the second half of the year,
Everything gets easier.
Martin.
I'm sorry to hear about
your patient.
Difficult case.
- Yes, it was.
I've been doing a study
of these resistant bugs
And was hoping you might be able
to help me review this one
If you kept your notes
and charts together.
Dr. Waylans tells me
you're thinking of applying
For the I.D. Fellowship.
Yes, I am.
I think that's a fine idea.
Fine idea.
Yo, doc.
Is this the patient?
Yes.
James?
- Yeah?
I'd like to talk to you,
when you get a chance.
- Yeah, I get off in 30 minutes.
- Great.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hi.
Hey, there, partner.
You got it?
Those are different.
They're more like morphine.
They're better.
I want the book.
Oh.
Maybe soon.
Really?
No,
that's not gonna work for me.
You just keep 'em comin',
you'll be all right.
Have fun.
You know I will.
What are you doing?
You can't take those here.
Why not?
I'm off duty.
You shouldn't drive on them.
I got a ride.
What's with you, man?
Dude, don't make a big deal
out of this.
We're all human beings.
We all gotta get
our kicks somehow.
What are you doing?
Don't follow me.
I'm just walking.
Get away from me.
You're makin' this
more than it has to be, doc.
You want more?
Yeah.
- You want more?
- Sure, yeah.
All right.
Oof.
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know.
Some kind of seizure.
Call a code,
he's gone into arrest!
All right, all right,
I got it. I'm on it. Okay.
Okay, jimmy!
Jimmy, can you hear me?
Jimmy?
Okay, okay, okay.
Jimmy, it's dr. Waylans.
Jimmy!
Jimmy, stay with me.
Jimmy.
Stay with us.
- So was he sick or anything?
- I don't know.
He went into some kind of
seizure. I tried to help.
I wouldn't be surprised if it
was some sort of drug overdose.
What makes you think that?
It's very erratic behavior.
Some of the nursing staff,
it occurred to them
That he might be a drug abuser.
They had
a mandatory test scheduled.
Perhaps you should go home.
Take a break.
Get back to the business
of being a doctor on Monday.
You off tomorrow?
Yup.
Okay with you, detective,
If the good doctor here
goes home?
Uh...yeah, I guess.
If we have any more questions,
we'll be in touch,
If you don't mind.
No, not at all.
He kissed me...
went to the hospital today...
they want to keep me overnight.
Rich asked me to be
his girlfriend...
the diagnosis is...
...but he doesn't act like it...
looks like a U.T.I... If you
love someone, set them free.
I spent the night at Rich's...
they called a specialist.
He carried me into the bedroom
and laid me down...
I can't believe he's...
he's such a liar.
Having surgery tomorrow...
I have a step-Sister...
they put the tube in
this morning...
it's an infection.
The anesthesia was great...
it's actually...
gave me the weirdest dreams...
Dr. Blake?
Yes.
Detective Krauss,
from the hospital yesterday.
You said
if we had any more questions...
I'm sorry
to just drop by like this.
Right.
Fine, come in.
Can I get you anything?
No, thanks.
So it seems the, uh,
the pills Mr. Vega took
Were spiked
with potassium cyanide.
You know about that?
- No.
Well, yeah, I mean,
I know what it is.
Some people suspect that he,
uh, he abused drugs.
Looks like
maybe he got a bad batch.
That's a shame.
I mean,
I didn't know him that well.
That's why I'm not as upset as
I would be if I knew him better.
I knew him to say hello to.
Did you ever see him
taking drugs?
No.
I hardly knew him, like I said.
You have a pen I could borrow?
Thanks.
You knew this, uh, orderly.
Just slightly.
Not well, kind of.
I mean, he was...
not my kind of person.
Do you know
where he got the drugs?
Could he have gotten them
from the hospital, stolen them?
No, they're
carefully monitored,
So I don't know
how an orderly could.
Only a doctor can prescribe.
Could a doctor have
gotten them for him?
Theoretically...
a doctor could...
fake a prescription,
or skim from a patient,
But that wouldn't be ethical,
so they don't.
So a doctor
could have gotten these.
No.
Did any doctors have any kind
of a relationship with Mr. Vega?
What? No, I...
I don't know.
I mean, like I said,
I didn't care for him,
So I didn't hang around him.
Were there any other doctors
who may have disliked him,
Who could've tainted the pills
with the, uh, the...
Potassium cyanide.
Look, uh...
I'm sorry if I seem distracted.
I understand.
It must be tough
trying to get back to normal,
After seeing somebody
die like that.
It has been...
especially with her.
Who?
No one.
Just...
A patient died.
It was a resistant strain
of an infection.
They're rare,
but increasingly common.
Antibiotics and cleansers
are making germs tougher.
It was a difficult case,
everyone agreed.
I know I must seem like
I'm reacting differently now
Than with James' passing away,
but he wasn't much of a person.
I mean, he'd make
lewd comments at women patients.
I think he may have even
fooled around with them,
Which, as a doctor, you can't.
Diane was a very nice girl.
We were close.
In a doctor-Patient way,
before she died...
but that's over now,
And I'm back to
the business of being a doctor.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Well, you know where I am,
detective,
If you have any more questions.
Excuse me a moment.
Doctor?
Just a second.
Mind if I have
a glass of water?
No, not at all.
Help yourself.
I'm sorry.
I need to collect some things.
I'm needed at the hospital.
Do you have any more questions?
I'm afraid
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Well, no.
I guess not.
I'll let you get ready, then.
Thanks for your help, doctor.
My pleasure.
His H&H are 12 and 36.
WBC 10.9
With a slight shift
to the left.
He's on a broad-Spectrum
antibiotic.
I'm about to hang
his third dose.
- Let's do blood cultures now
and times two for a temporary,
Then 101.
- Yeah.
- Is it gonna hurt?
- A little, but don't worry.
I'm getting better all the time.
Make a fist.
- Doctor?
- Yes.
