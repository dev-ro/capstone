Relentless!
Relentless! Relentless!
Relentless! Relentless!
Do you believe in the devil?
I agreed to do this interview
to talk about music,
not religion.
I know you said it
starts and ends with the music,
but with The Relentless,
there was much more to their
success than just their songs.
What about all the disturbing
scenarios surrounding the band?
That's the duality
of rock 'n' roll.
And what is that supposed
to mean?
Dude, that riff is sick!
I mean, mate, I'm no Jimmy Page
but it's a pretty
fucking sick riff,
- right?
- Yeah.
- Is that a new song?
- It will be.
Oh, hi, Ms. Spouse.
- Hi, Leo.
- Shut up.
Are you sure you don't wanna try
California just for the summer
and maybe move after
you get your degree?
Mom, look, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs,
they both dropped out of school.
I'm just trying to keep
the rhythm going.
Okay.
Oh, I gotta go anyway.
All right.
- All right, you have a good day.
- Mm.
- All right.
- All right.
- Love you, bye.
- Love you, too, bye.
Dude.
Five freaking days till we're living
in L.A. It's finally happening, man.
Hell yeah.
We'll work through
this long distance stuff.
I wouldn't chase my dreams if you weren't
going to be with me in them forever, okay?
Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
Hey, you got the new
Eyes of Black?
Oh, this?
Yeah, my mom got it for me.
Man, she rules.
My parents didn't let me listen
to them till I was 18.
So when you guys make it big
and Rolling Stone asks you,
"What do you want to change most
in the world with The Relentless?"
What are you gonna say?
I gotta finish the lyrics first.
It's kind of twisted you waited this
long to tell them, don't you think?
- What was their response?
- You know, typical parental bullshit.
Make sure
he's taking care of you,
make sure he gets
the drummer on the plane.
- Make sure he doesn't fuck up your career.
- Oh, charming. Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah, I heard he flew in
from Australia or something.
All the way in
for certain people.
- This is gonna be easy!
- Yeah.
Woo! Are you ready?
Mate, you're
an incredible drummer!
That's what they tell me, man.
Band's fucking shit though.
What the fuck did you just say?
Whoa.
Hello, mate. How's it going?
I'm Ricky. This is Leo.
Can we, um,
can we buy you a drink?
Are you excited?
I'd be a lot more excited
if you were coming with me.
No sex and drugs,
just rock 'n' roll. Right?
No sex and drugs.
Not until you make it out west
anyway.
Oh, come on.
Johnny, please promise us that you're
going to be responsible in Hollywood.
- Please?
- I promise.

You're just kidding about all that

- Hmm, no. No. - No, we're
not fucking kidding, you twat.
So you mean to tell me
that you guys already have,
what, a full on record deal,
a booking agent, a manager
and a 62-day North American tour
lined up?
Wow! Someone's finally
paying attention.
It took a while, didn't it?
Bloody hell.
How'd you guys land all that?
Come on, mate, we're busy men.
Are you in or not?
Give me a few days to think
about it, yeah?
Oh. Dear me. That's not
the right answer at all, is it?
No, I think, um, I think we're
gonna go with the other guy.
- I think he's a bit more...
- Exactly. Just a little...
You know what? Yeah. Good luck.
- Should we just?
- We should just go.
- Just go? Just go. Just go?
- Because... No point in... Yeah. Yeah.
Nice to meet you, man.
Um, yeah.
Fuck. Hey, lads!
All right.

Yeah, yeah.

- Keep an eye on this stuff please.
- Yup.
Hey, hey.
Could you watch my ax, too?
Sure.
- What tune you all playing at?
- Oh, Drop D.
Drop D. I got it, okay. Okay.
All right. Let's do it.
Wait. We gotta wait for this
fucking guy with this guitar.
No shit. We're waiting for him?
I don't know where he is.
I can't just leave his shit.
It took you that long
to find booze? And an apple?
Boy, I don't waste my time
with that poison.
You think I collect cans and bottles
all day so I can buy some liquor?
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I'm just checking.
- All right.
- Kid, perception is not reality.
It's what you feel,
not what you see.
Sorry, man,
we didn't mean to judge you.
Don't get caught inside
the "Hollow wood."
- What you feel!
- Yeah.
- What you feel!
- Got it. Feeling it.
- All right, kid, let's get out.
- Apple? I feel like getting wasted.
- I feel it, too.
- Amen.
John 7:24.
Stop judging by mere appearances
and instead, judge correctly.
Can I show you boys around town?
All right, come on. What was it?
The Bible quote that put you off
or my body odor?
Be honest.
I don't believe in the Bible,
you fuckin' weirdo.
Oh.
Hey, have a little faith in me.
And the boys on my left,
they just arrived in town and
hope to be the next big thing!
Hey, you guys know
what hope is, don't you?
Hope is the little old lady
in Vegas
with a bucket full of pennies.
Three sevens. Three sevens!
We're actually fucking here!
Right, when are we gonna go
meet up with the record label?
Oh, you know what, better yet
let's get our booking agent
to line up some local gigs
before the tour, yeah?
Right. Settle down, sunshine.
I know you're excited.
Management deals with all that.
All the business.
- The record label...
- Oh, right, fuck of course.
Well, let's just meet up with him now.
Yeah? He sounds brilliant!
You've already met him.
- Come again?
- Um, yeah, um...
I'm the manager. Yeah. Hi.
- Um, four, five years now.
- Five years.
Right. Bollocks. For real,
let's get on with it. Come on.
- Where's he at?
- What's wrong with this pecker?
That's fucking daft, mate!
You're a roadie who's never been on the
road before not a fucking manager!
Yeah? I managed to get you from
some shitty little pub in England
with your four shitty fans
from the Sunset strip.
- It's not a bad start! Whoa!
- You're fucking dead!
- Stop him! Stop him!
- Calm the fuck down, man.
Listen! Ricky might
work in mysterious ways.
Yes.
- We do have a plan.
- Mysterious?
Fucking pathologically
lying and mysterious, man!
All right, listen.
Just wait until you meet Johnny.
Ricky found him on line what?
- Four? Four.
- Four years ago, yeah.
- Four years ago and we've been
writing together ever since. -
- Over webcam.
- Yeah.
Webcam?
You've never even met this kid
in real life before, have you?
No. No. No. But, okay.
You want the coolest job
in the world, yeah?
- Guess what, you've got to work for it.
- Not wrong.
Right.
Fine. Fuck both of you.
- Ouch.
- Why's he such a cock?
What's the plan then, man?
Uh, I say that we move into our new spot.
Just chill out. Shoot the breeze.
- Wait for the other guys to get here.
- Like it. I am in.
Fine. Good. I'm fucking knackered.
Let's get on with it.
- Where's it at?
- We're here.
What?
- What's the code, man?
- No code.
Hop in!
We're living in a van.
Yes. It's rock 'n' roll.
Now stop being
such a whiny cunt and get in.
Go on.
I get the back row
and that is nonnegotiable, man.
Hello!
- Fuck!
- Yes!
How have you been?
Dylan, man, I heard so much
about you, seriously, dude.
Right, right. Yeah well it's probably all
bollocks just like this whole project.
No. No. No. Dude, your drumming is
incredible. This is your destiny.
I do love your voice, mate.
- That's the spirit!
- We're Relentless!
- All right!
- All right.
So who's the chap playing bass?
Guys. Guys, this is Lily.
Hey, Lily.
Let's see you play "Damnation".
I'm not gonna sit here and play along to
a recording while you all stare at me.
I wanna jam.
Let's see if we have chemistry.

Won't be a minute.
Uh, she's perfect.
Fucking hell, I'm good!
Mate, she's a she. She's a she
that looks like that.
How the fuck are we
supposed to be in a band
with someone who looks
like that without...
You know, he's right, man.
I mean, it's gonna be pretty
tough to resist our primal urges.
You guys know I can hear you,
right?
What makes you think I even like boys?
- So you're a lesbian?
- Shut the fuck up, Dylan!
Okay.
Lily, do you wanna be
in The Relentless?
- Raise your hand if you want
her to join the band. - Yes!
Got any shows booked?
Um, um,
yeah, um, about that.
Um, we do actually have a lot of good
stuff in the pipe at the moment.
Um, we've got some calls coming
in and some demos going out.
And it's actually looking
really good, really healthy.
And I'm positive that the
gigs are going to come in any day now.
Are you trying to convince me
or yourself?
All right.
Motley Crue.
Guns N' Roses, Van Halen,
they all started here.
Mate, The Doors
are the house fucking band!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, look, just
don't get all fucking cheesed off
if they don't book us.
All right.
Yeah, no worries.
We'll just get a new manager.
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. That's a man's
living you're joking about there.
These guys just canceled
so in eight weeks,
I've got a show coming up
that you guys would be great on.
Fantastic.
Just to confirm.
That does mean
we've got the gig, isn't it?
- It sure does.
- It sure does.
- I knew it.
- Yes!
Now you gotta do the work.
Oh, well, these lads are not scared
of hard work. Are you, guys?
How much are we gonna get paid?
How much you get paid all depends
on how many tickets you sell.
I just moved here from England. How
am I supposed to sell any tickets?
It's been like this since
the '80s, guys. No handouts.
Oh, I thought
you liked our demo?
I do. It's totally a killer demo
but I only gamble on headliners.
Okay. We'll take another stack.
I like your style.
Mind blown. Mind blown.
Great. Well,
pleasure doing business.
All right, Ricky, now's
your time to shine, mate.
Book as many shows as you can
in the local area
any time, any fucking shit hole.
We'll play for free if we have to.
- Gotta get the word out.
- Oh, dear me, that's the truth.
You heard the guy,
the work starts here.
I gotta go to work. Give me some of those
tickets now, I'm gonna sell some later.
Good idea. There we go.
- I'll see you guys later tonight.
- See you later!
I bet you she's a stripper!
Oh, Dylan, will you keep your
sordid fantasies to yourself?
What do you think, Johnny?
I think we're The Relentless
and in eight weeks
we're selling out The Whisky.
Hey, man. Hey. Can you give me
a cigarette, man?
- Come on.
- Uh, here.
Give me a hand.
Thanks.
Ah, I don't like those.
- Whoa!
- What the fuck, man?
- Hey, what's the matter, man?
- Whoa!
- What are you doing, you fucking junkie?
- I'm sorry, man.
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?
Pre-selling tickets here
like you're some
fucking stupid garage band?
Is that it?
Do you know how long I've been
stuck here in this vessel
waiting for you four dicks
to show up?
Do you know how long?
What the fuck?
Come on, let's go!
Let's get the show on the road!
Pick up our tickets right now.
What did you say?
What did you say to me?
I said, pick up our tickets.
Duh.
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Rebel. Huh?
With the ring in the nose.
And those little,
little tatty tats. Yeah.
Got any other rings?
No?
You know what? How about that?
I'll buy a fucking ticket.
Why don't you get down on your
fucking knees and you pick them up?
Oh, look at the manager, grubbing
around in the gutter. That's perfect!
-- What the
hell is your deal, mate?
Hey, my deal's
the best in town, man.
You should sign it.
Oh, this is the religious loony
from the liquor store.
Let's fucking go.
That's really beautiful, man.
Thank you.
You're so quick to judge!
I thought that's what you hated in
people, when they did it to you.
Huh?
They judge the way you look,
the way you dress,
even the music you listen to.
All right,
what's your story, man?
I'm gonna have some
very important people there.
Very, very important.
So please, you put me
on the guest list, all right?
Thanks.
- What did he say?
- I don't know. Let's just fucking go.
Hey, baby. Guess who just got
a show at The Whisky?
That's amazing.
Guess who finally put in
her transcript for UCLA?
Uh, fuck yeah. So that means that
when my band breaks up in six years
I can work for you, huh?
Hmm. Babe, I don't really know if you're
cut out to be an executive assistant.
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

- Bye.

"The Relentless."
Not a bad name.
Be careful what you ask for.
You do know how many bands there are
in this town trying to make it.
Most can't handle the truth
about their potential.
They just end up living
in denial,
working at Guitar Center

or loading in gear
at the same clubs

when they were your age. So...

Nice meeting you.

He fucking did this
to sabotage us.
Always some fucking bullshit!
I'm done. I'm done, man.
- I'm fucking done.
- Hey, hey, hey!

is here to see us.
- Yeah, right. I bet, Vic.
- No, he's right.

fucking label. Fuck!
I'm not going in there.
That's Damien.
He raped me
the night I quit his band.
The fuck didn't you
press charges?
His dad is connected
to a lot of sketchy people
and he's one of the most
powerful attorneys in Hollywood.
Oh, fuck that.

all the clubs on the strip.
If you cause trouble,
they'll ban us.
You're not in Ohio anymore,
Johnny.
I say we smash his head in
right now.
No, no, no, we can't, all right?
Now I say we just sleep it off.
Sleep it off?
Mate, we just had the most
important night of our careers
ruined by some cunt rich kid
and we're not even gonna do anything
about it like a bunch of wankers?

Ah, escapism.

certain part of everybody
that wants to be somewhere else
or somebody else. Thank you.

all rational thought.
- What do you say, pilgrim?
- You got a problem, old man?
Problem?
I don't know about a problem.
I don't think so.
But I do have some solutions.
Hey, Johnny. Yeah.
You know,
it's always the drummer
that are the first to go down
the pokey hole.
You know, Led Zeppelin,
The Who. Huh.
So, what do you say? Should we go
inside and have a little drinky?
I'm sorry.

It's not what you feel
but what you see.
The devil.
Hey, what was it? The car or the new suit?

Oh, come on.

It's a shock value, tongue-in-cheek

Oh, you know,
let's ask Vic's Bible-hugging

Anyway, let's go on inside and have

Okay, right, look,
why exactly a band like us?
Rock 'n' roll, heavy metal.
You're so loyal to me.
You wear me on your sleeve.
But your fans are dangerous
and your fans
are full of passion.
Oh, whatever, mate.
You're fucking mental.
Have you ever seen Iron Maiden?
They filled stadiums
full of their fans.
Singing along to songs like
"The Number of the Beast."
Or what about Van Halen? Huh.
"Running with the Devil."
The Stones,
"Sympathy for the Devil."
I mean, on and on

Great.
All right. Fine. I'm a believer.
Now what?
Are you speaking for everybody?
All right, I'll take one.
I'll take one.
We'll perform a ritual ceremony.
And then I will make you
international icons.
What's the ritual?
Something very simple.
Human sacrifice.
- Oh, come on.
- No fucking way.
- Well, make it a revenge kill.
- I'm not killing anyone.
No, you're right.
Let's fucking go, guys.
- Yeah.
- Sit down, Johnny. Sit down.
Somebody is gonna have to die.
Johnny,
you might as well go

Johnny? Is everything all right?
I don't know. You tell me.
- Did grandma tell you?
- Did she tell me what?
They just found some cancerous
tumors in my left breast.
The surgery and the treatment
is really expensive.
I didn't want to tell you
because I didn't want it
to keep you...
We have to do something.
How time do we have?
Let me... Let me go back to sleep

It's important

I'll call you tomorrow.

Bring the keys back to me.
I'm not sure I can do this.
Ricky.
- I can.
- Good man.
Gentlemen, thank you.
You'll all get the chance
to save Damien's life.
Please, let me out!
Johnny, go save your mom's life.
Give her my love.
Tell her I'll see her later.
You will be loved.
Feared. Despised.
Worshipped.
All the masses will congregate
around your music
like the ultimate opiate.
Let him burn.
Ricky!
All your desires
will be fulfilled.
You are The Relentless!
Oh, Johnny,
what the fuck are you doing?
We came here to play music,
not God.
True colors will always fade
in the right light.
Electrifying performance,
gentlemen.
When opportunity knocks,
make sure you answer.

- Hello?
- Is this Vic?
This is Elias
from Akkadian Records.
Hey. Hey, man. Um...
Thanks for coming to our show.
I'm really sorry about our set.
Yeah, that was,
that was amateur hour,
to say the least, but I listened
to your demo late last night.
Look, these songs
have real potential.
Can you guys come by my office
today at 3:00 p.m. for a meeting?
- Yes. Yeah, man, absolutely.
- All right, see you then.
Wow.
- Lily?
- Mm-hmm.
Gonna need your car.
We're all not gonna fit
in my car. Where's the van?

Elias, they're here.
Ah, you must be Johnny.
Yeah, so you, uh,
work from home?
I do whatever the fuck I want,
just like you assholes.
Have a seat.
Did you guys hear about
what happened to Damien Collins?
What happened?
They found him dead,
deep in the valley, scary scene.
What?
It's crazy how karma
works out, right?
What do you mean?
Well, two years ago, he's driving
wasted, he killed two people,
Vince Neil style.
I don't follow.
Well, I guess that's before
you guys' time.
Vince Neil during the Shout
at the Devil album cycle,
driving totally wasted
to a liquor store,
crashed into another car.
The drummer from Hanoi Rocks died.
He was riding shotgun.
The two people he hit,
permanent brain damage.
Then what happened?
Then Vince pleaded guilty
and because
he's the singer of Motley Crue,
got about two weeks jail time.
Huh. That's mental.
The same thing
happened to Damien.
He barely did any jail time
because of his father,
who's a very powerful lawyer,
a good guy to have in your back
pocket if you get into any trouble.
But, hey,
let's talk about the deal.
Any of you guys on hard drugs?
No. Smoke a little pot, drink.
Any of you romantically involved
with, uh,
Lily?
I'm not a fucking cliché, Christ.
All right,
you guys got a manager?
Yeah, we have. Of course.
Just have absolutely no idea
where he is right now.
Wow. Well...
He picked a hell of a time
to miss a meeting.
I'm offering you
$200,000 advance.
Fucking...
Shouldn't we get an attorney
to look this over first?
What the fuck
are you doing?
Heh.
Glad to see
we're on the same page.
Cool.
Let's make a record.
Mate, I think we all agree,
you should just take
a chunk of the money
and put it towards
your mom's treatment, you know?
That means
the world to me, man.
But for now,
let's go celebrate this deal.
Fuck, I wanna rage but I told my
work I would show up tonight.
- Where do you work, anyway?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
So you're just not
gonna tell us?
I like it better this way.

Sorry, I just...
It's just not convincing,
and I...
I thought we talked
about dark, dark.
How about a cathartic moment,
a transformative moment
in your life?
Convince me.

So, what are we gonna call

Oh.
How about Born to Rock?
- Oh, God, no.
- Born to Rock?
That's a terrible idea.
That's the dumbest fucking
thing I've ever heard.
Why is that?
Look, we need something
that's timeless,
that's iconic,
something maybe controversial.
If you were to do an interview
about this album,
what would you say the theme is?
Independence from fear.
Indulgence
instead of abstinence.
Self-realization.
Good answers.
How about favorite album titles?
- Appetite for Destruction.
- Let It Bleed.
Shout at the Devil.
And Justice for All.
Evil Empire.
Ricky?
Yeah, um, sorry.
Were you talking
album titles there?
Because Back in Black...
Back in Black's my favorite.
Who are you?
I'm the manager.
Really?
Where you been, man?
I just had some soul searching to do.
You know, it was right.
American Satan.
- That's hot.
- Yeah.
- That's a hit.
- Yeah.
I reckon
we've got an album name.
Everybody down with it?
I fuckin' love it.
- Me, too.
- I as well.
Vic?
Oh, come on, man.
What's done is done.
Yeah, yeah, I'm good with it.
Well, I don't know what the fuck
he's talking about but...
I know what's not done.
A video.
You play your cards right,
you got a shot
at a great career.
Well, I cannot wait
to get out on the road.
It's gonna be crazy.
Okay, remember, you...
You're the manager.
You're not a roadie,
and you're not the party guy.
So, what are you getting at?
I'm getting at separation
of church and state.
Oh, no, no, look. I may look like a rookie,
okay, but I was built for this, Elias.
- Just trust me.

We are pressing charges

My daughter was seduced
by that lesbian Satan woman,
and there were other band members
in the room, and they were all
having sex together, and it was
unholy, and they took advantage
of my little girl.
They can all go to hell.
Nobody took advantage of me.
I had the best night of my life.
The only problem here is that my mom
and dad don't have sex anymore.
And guess what, Mom, the legal
age of consent in Indiana is 16.
So, Lily, I fucking love you.
Johnny's my hero.
Relentless forever!
Really?
Look. No. I'm not. I swear.

It looks like
the surgery got it all
before it had time to spread.
That's amazing.
I'm just gonna keep on,
you know, getting my checkups
and all of that,
and, um, I should be okay.
So I'm gonna hop in the shower
and I'm gonna get ready,
'cause I can't wait
to see your show.
And what
the do you guys think?
We need less guns and more sex.
Less war and more music.
And more fucking sex.
Oh, come on, man,
at least let us play tonight.
This is Johnny
and Vic's hometown.
No, man, listen.
You're off the tour.
I've called all the promoters. We
cannot be guilty by association.
This is fucking bullshit. This has nothing
to do with that girl and her mom.
Tell you how
this is gonna go down.
You youngsters
are gonna pack up your shit,
you're gonna take your cheesy
ass fucking devil flags
and get the fuck off our tour.
Yeah, well, have fun playing
500 capacity shitholes
the rest of your life, fella!
Come on, guys, the people
already paid to see us play.
- Let's just play...
- Fuck you and your poser ass band!
You fucking dick!
Lily, toss me another one.
I'm calling Elias!
You guys are finished!
I'm calling him right now!
You guys are finished! You're
off this tour! You're off!
I'm callin' him right now,
you fucker!
What the fuck's going on?
Oh, you didn't hear?
Show's cancelled, mate.
Hi, um, this probably isn't the
best first impression of the band,
but it's a pleasure
to finally meet you both.
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you.
Yeah, um, welcome.
Johnny,
the show's been cancelled.
What do you have
to say about that?
We'll be back.
I won't be able to make that,
I'm pretty sure.
All right, later.
I have five different promoters
on hold
and they're all wanting
to cancel the shows
because The Relentless
aren't on tour anymore.
What?
Make that seven. Nashville and New
York just called, freaking out.
Oh, Jesus. Hello?
Elias? We have an issue.
Tell me you did not
kick them off the tour.
That's what my guys wanted.
What was I supposed to do?
Yeah, well, I'm sure your guys
are gonna want to get paid
for the rest of the shows.
That's not gonna happen when
half the audience wants refunds.
They fucked a 17-year-old!
I don't care if they fucking gang-banged
your sister and made you watch.
You don't fucking kick bands off my
tour without talking to me first!
What should I do now?
Maybe you should just,
uh, never call me again
and go get a real fucking job!
So, what did he say?
He told me I need to re-evaluate
the situation.
Your van's shot. American Satan.
So you really have
to head straight back?
The label's making me do a bunch of
promo now that we lost this tour.
I wish I didn't have to.
It's gonna take me awhile to get the
grants and the loans that I need for UCLA.
I'm okay if you, if you need
your personal freedom.

Los Angeles based
heavy metal band, Relentless...
That's The Relentless.
The name of the band.
Okay. The Relentless,
was involved in a brutal
bar fight that left one man dead
and several injured.
The record label has posted
the $1.5 million bail
for the singer, Johnny Faust.
How do you feel
about the release
of The American Satan?
It's American Satan,
not The American Satan,
and I feel terrific.
Aren't you concerned
about the message
this band is sending?
Sir, have you listened
to the record
or even read the lyrics?
- I have not, but it...
- I see.
But it seems
that there is no shame
in the death of a...
That was self-defense.
And, uh, very unfortunately,
there was a death.
But if someone physically
attacks someone else,
that is a risk that they take.
I guess now it's up
to a jury to decide
if it was self-defense or not.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, that is the process.
You really know your stuff,
don't you?
What do you plan to do
now that your singer
cannot leave the state
because he's awaiting trial?
I thought you'd never ask.
We have put together
the biggest,
baddest hard rock festival
that this part of Middle America
has ever seen.

We've got to tell Lily.
Look, he hasn't even shown
himself since we made the record.
The record, the live show, the
press, that's what got us here.
I'm not a fucking puppet.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But you heard Hawk, right?
The fact we were in Kansas the day the
album came out can't be a coincidence.
You don't think Elias is in
league with him, do you?
Still, how do we even start
that convo, man? Now...
Until that fool morphs into
something, I'm not buying it.
Lily, you know, she wears
devil stuff for fashion.
Maybe she's his daughter.
Or maybe I've just been
stuck here in Kansas
rigging a jury to make sure
your best friend
doesn't have to spend the rest
of his life in jail?
Or maybe Elias and Lily
have known each other
longer than you think?
Or maybe you guys
are so desperate
to be rock gods,
that your ego caused your brain
to hallucinate me?
So many questions,
so few clues.
You want to be the future,
you gotta pay your dues.
More inspiration
to sing the fucking blues.
Verdict is not guilty,
citing the stand-your-ground law
which states a person
may use deadly force
in self-defense when faced
with a reasonable
perceived threat.
- Johnny.
- Give him some room. Give him some room.
- Johnny, do you have a comment?
- Back. Back.
No, no.

The stand your ground epidemic
is being directly linked
-to a rock 'n' roll group called...
- The Relentless.
A rock band called The Relentless
and their debut album...
American Satan.
Hundreds of cases
in 27 different states
have already been reported
as of this morning.
We've seen incidents
here in Sydney...
Manaus, Sao Paulo.
Guadalajara, Monterrey.
- Tel Aviv.
- And Berlin.
This continues
the debate on how far
one can go in self-defense.
One thing is
certain, the power of music
appears to be stronger
than ever.
How are you feeling, boys?
- We have to stop the killing.
- Well, there's no turning back now.
We're changing the world,
and you are our mascot.
How come no other bands had to
do anything so fucking insane?
Look, sanity.
It's all relative
to the times in which we live.
You know, in 1967,
we put Aleister Crowley
on the front of Sgt. Pepper's
we wrote underneath it,
"Welcome The Rolling Stones!"
Ha! Aleister Crowley!
The old sorcerer himself.
Back then,
that was beyond fucking insane!
And then six months later,
The Stones put out their album.
Their Satanic Majesties Request.
And on it, on the front cover,
they had hidden
The Beatles faces.
If I'd have told Zeppelin
in the late '60s
what was going on with Apple
in the world today,
they'd think
I was a raving loony.
How the fuck do we even know
that you're real?
And what, what the fuck
does this have to do with Apple?
We have a skeptic
amongst us, huh?
All right, Leo.
Look up the official price
of the first Apple computer.
It was $666.
Yeah. Six hundred
and sixty-six, really?
Yeah. Yeah.
The forbidden fruit
with a big bite taken out of it.
What a great logo.
And what about
the first three numbers
of the zip code
of Topeka, Kansas.
Where I made you guys icons.
666.
Holy shit.
I'd rather call it unholy shit.
So, Johnny, when are you gonna
actually tell Lily
the truth about this band?
After you fuck her again?
- Oh, ooh, sorry.
- Oh, fuck.
Did I put my foot in it?
I'm so sorry.
You didn't know the lead singer
had a little bit of news
for you?
Oh. It's amazing,
isn't it, Johnny?
That you can't keep a promise
either to me or to Gretchen!
Come and face the music!
How do you know
he had sex with Lily?
The same way I know
that Ricky is lying prone
on that stage.
And let me tell you
the one cardinal sin in my book:
Stupidity.
Cassandra!
Ricky?
Ricky!
Ricky. Ricky. Please.
Don't fucking do this to me.
Ricky, please.
Ricky, please. Come on.
Ricky.
Ricky! Please!
Ricky, please, come on.
You can't do this to me.
No!
Please!
Mom? Mom?
I'm up here, Johnny.
Mom, I need you to call Gretchen.
She won't answer me.
She was here this morning.
Did you really cheat on her?
- She was here, in the house?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah,
she wanted to surprise you.
She transferred to UCLA.
- Why would you do something
so stupid, huh? -
Gretchen is such a special girl,
I would give anything to have
someone like that in my life.
Steve Jobs said dropping acid
was one of the most important
impacts on his entire life.
It just showed him there's
another side to the coin.
What's up, Elias?
Yeah, Vic, you're gonna go
on CNN in a few hours.
You and Lily are the only ones
I can find, so don't be late.
We're back live
in three, two, one,
camera.
Lily, let's start with you.
Are you for or against what some
of your fans seem to be doing?
We didn't respond to 9/11
with peace and prayer.
We responded by doing
everything we could
to stop those people
from hurting us again.
That's what our fans are doing to
their predators. In self-defense.
Right. So, uh, Vic,
uh, how do you feel
about the violence?
You agree with Lily
on what's going on
with your fans?
I, uh, I-I think
what is happening is a, um,
is a reflection of our culture.
And where we are as a society.
It's both fascinating and scary.
The power of music.
So that means that you agree
or disagree?
Well, there are more
dimensions to our consciousness
that need to be healed
and explored.
I believe in not everything you
say is a, um, yes or a no,
or right or a wrong answer.
Um, thank you.
I'm gonna go lay down now.
I'd like to go lie down myself.
Not really sure what I'm supposed
to do or say at this point.
Nothin' I say up here's gonna
bring back my best friend.
Nothing's gonna help
make any sense of what's happened.
Thank you for all the laughs.
For all the smiles...
Thank you for believing in me.
and encouraging me
to follow my dreams.
You're forever in our hearts,
Ricky.
In honor of Ricky,
I say we keep this train rolling
full speed ahead.
You know it's exactly
what he would've wanted.
Yeah, I reckon so.
Good.
It's time for our world tour.
You're icons now.
The controversy, the sex,
the fame, the power,
it's all part of the ride.
Don't get lost in it.
And lay off the fuckin' drugs.
Are you ready to embrace it?
All of it.
Understand these
fans are maniacal.

before we do. Let's go.

Okay, but the meet and greet
ended hours ago,
and now you need to get behind
the barrier, please.
I'm not talking about that one.
I want her to go on the bus.
You really think
that's a good idea?
Listen, I know what time it is.
Tonight is a bonding experience
with my daughter.
Her dream is to lose
her virginity to Johnny.

- Are you fucking serious?
- Yes, I am.

They happen to be a little
angry right now.
I, uh...
I had to cancel
the rest of the tour.
What?
That's bullshit, Elias.

Did you two happen to fuck...
a teenage virgin yesterday?

- Her father blew his own head off.
Fuck.
You cannot talk to anybody
about last night.
But why is the tour cancelled?
Oh, I wonder why.
Maybe it's because you both
were strung the fuck out.
Now she doesn't have a
fucking dad because of me.
You ever think about Ricky?
Huh?
What you're doing to yourselves?
I'm gonna send you out to Malibu

dumb-ass hippie retreat.
Lily. Lily.
Okay, look.
I told your mother
I'd make this happen.
You're lucky to have her.
I'll go. I'll go.

Yeah. Okay, bye.
Wow, do you always
crawl back like that?
Listen, we have to discuss
plans for Hellfest.
It's time for me
to make you a legend.
What are you talking about?
The onstage ritual.
Now look,
I'm gonna give you a gun.
And then I'm gonna have
a mentally unstable person
attack you
during the first song.
You just blow his head off and keep
playing like nothing's happened.
- I won't do that.
- Well...
I'm afraid all the band
has agreed to this.
And it is a democracy,
so you've gotta do your part.
And then, you know,
just take a year off.
You can spend time
with that lovely mumsy of yours
and just work on your new album.
I didn't start playing music
to promote killing.
You know,
it's religion
that separates humanity,
but it's music
that brings us all together.
You know, more people are killed
through religious conflict
than any other reason.
We are all our own gods.
If you want to find the answers,
you have to look
inside yourself.
Not up to the sky.
Our carnal desires
are not to be suppressed.
They are to be liberated.
And sin?
Sin is simply
a matter of opinion.
You're right.
Religion does separate.
It created you.
But I have my own free will.
Yes, you do.
It's a pity you can't use it
to stop being a junkie.

Gretchen.

I'll pray for Johnny.
Fuck.
How are things for you out here?
Well, actually, I met someone.
When you're back on your feet,
I'd love for you to meet him.
Man, look at you.
Being a rock star
is an intersection
between who you are
and who you wanna be.
You hold the key
to your own destiny.
It's about time
you start looking for the lock.
Welcome, I am very thankful.
You have chosen to heal with me.
Thank you for having me.
Relentless! Relentless!
Relentless! Relentless!
Okay, Johnny,
we're on in three minutes,
and Lily
is still not fucking here.
- Can we push our set time back?
- Not a chance.
The county will shut us down.
They've got a hard curfew.
Relentless!
This will turn into
Woodstock '99 chaos.
Johnny. This is who
I was telling you about.
Samael, meet my son, Johnny.
Hey, Johnny. Man, congratulations
on your success.
And this is such
a cool festival.
Hawk, escort my mother
to the soundboard, please.
- I wanna watch from the stage.
- Yeah.
Go, now.
See you in a minute.
Watch your tone.
Mm. Ooh.
How fucking dare you?
I fucking dare you.
Now you get on that stage tonight,
and you kill! You hear me?
And I'll leave mumsy alone.
Hmm? Good.
Come on, guys.
We got a show tonight!
Oh, um...
This will get you on the stage.
You know,
we both have free will,
yet we both standing here.
You know, a puppet is free
as long as he loves his strings.
You're not controlling

You're not lost in it, either.
You are the storm.

Okay. I gotta tell sound
what the hell's going on.
Stay with her.
Not one second
do you leave her alone.
Where were you?
I had to get a fix. I thought
I could last till after the set.
Fuck, I gotta piss.

I was the fucking bass player,

You know the best time
to burn a lie
into one's soul
is in the heat of anger.
What did you want to change most
in the world with your music?
Humanity's obsession
with religion.
It divides us.
Whether it's Jesus,
or Mohammed, or Moses.
We...
We're all brothers and sisters.
We all bleed the same shade.
Any other proclamations?
It's sad.
The only two things
that touch people
as much as love and music
are sex and violence.
You're pleading not guilty,
claiming temporary insanity.
Don't you fear
that by saying he was the devil
it would look as if you're
mocking the court to the jury?
You don't get it!
Look, he's dark energy.
Einstein proved that energy
can't be destroyed,
it can only be displaced.
Enough with the gimmick,
seriously.
He will keep coming back!
Over and over!
I know you've said it
starts and ends with the music
but with The Relentless,
there was much more to their
success than just their songs.
What about all the disturbing
scenarios surrounding the band?
It's the duality
of rock 'n' roll.
And what is that supposed
to mean?
The copycat killings,
they were very tragic.
But bullying in schools
and teenage suicide rates
had a massive drop.
Positive changes on our society.
That's the life.
The rest, that's the darkness.
- You're writing new songs, huh?
- Yeah.
It's not like they'll ever see
the light of day, though.
I'd say it has to
be covered in total darkness
before it can struggle
to reach the light.
People grow today
more from music than religion.
You now have that power.
You also have a visitor.
Who are you?
Gabriel.
Johnny Faust.
Now the most iconic singer
in rock music today.
Who was the man he shot onstage?
It was an act.
An act?
It's show business.
In the studio,
I'm with guitarist, Leo Donovan,
and bassist, Lily Mayflower,
of The Relentless.
First question, your singer Johnny
keeps mentioning the devil.
Is this just sensationalism?
Everything Johnny has said
is true,
but we can't exactly sit here
and talk about
a physical version of the devil,
can we, Larry?
People will think
we've gone crazy.
In music, the devil you see
on album covers and T-shirts,
it's symbolism
for the counterculture.
So then what's the real devil?
The voice inside our head that makes
us do bad things without remorse.
Says whatever it takes
to get what it wants.
And the man who was
supposedly shot on stage,
what was that?
That was a great way
to sell records.
An unidentified man...
I wanna get this right.
An unidentified,
mentally unstable person
comes on stage,
wields a gun at him.
A good attorney
could argue self-defense,
but he's refusing legal counsel.
Does he want freedom? Does
he want to play music again?
Quite honestly,
there's really only one person
that would get Johnny
back onstage.
And that is?
Vic and Leo told me everything.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I also talked to Lily.
She told me I should blame her
and the drugs and not you.
She also said you were thinking
about me the whole time.
I love you.
Elias hired some crazy attorney
that says that he can get
you off on a technicality.
Elias went under oath saying
it was all part of the theatrics
that the record label had you do.
Hey, Johnny.
Remember that attorney I told you
about the first time we met?
This is Damien's father.
Hey, Johnny.
Hell of a first album.
Can't wait to hear the next one.
I still love you.
