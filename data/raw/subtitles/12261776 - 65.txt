You've led explorations before.
Not for this long.
Six weeks at most.
She's a resilient kid.
But this isn't supply
transport. She'll be fine.
Or a jump to cyllene and back.
It's a two-year run. I
know. I know how long.
Just go.[Laughing] it's hard.
Mills: I'll go. I'm just
thinking about what to say.
Say they're tripling
your salary,
which is how we can
afford to treat her.
To cure her.[Coughing]
You okay?
[Exhales]
I'm fine.
It's two years...
I won't be here.
I know, but when you
get back, she will.
Dad! I can't do it.

You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Are you sure?
Dad, I just want you
to help me with this.
Here. Don't blow so hard.
Just easy. A little gentle. I

Your thumbs are perfect.
You're just blowing too hard.
Here, watch me. Watch me.
[Whistles through hands]
