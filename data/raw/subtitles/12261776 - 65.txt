- I'm just gonna go tell her.
- No. No, I...
I wanna tell her myself.
She knows what it's
like for you to be away.
You've led explorations before.
Not for this long.
Six weeks at most.
- She's a resilient kid. She'll be fine.
- But this isn't supply transport.
Or a jump to Cyllene and back.
- It's a two-year run.
- I know. I know how long.
- Just go.
- It's hard.
I'll go. I'm just thinking
about what to say.
Say they're tripling your salary, which
is how we can afford to treat her.
- To cure her.
- You okay?
I'm fine.
It's two years...
I won't be here.
I know, but when you
get back, she will.
Dad!
I can't do it.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Are you sure?
Dad, I just want you
to help me with this.
Here. Don't blow so hard.
- Just easy. A little gentle.
- I think my thumbs are too small.
Your thumbs are perfect.
You're just blowing too hard.
Here, watch me. Watch me.
Why are you so good at everything?
You make it look so easy.
It is easy. You just have
to know how to do it.
- Don't blow in, blow down.
- Okay.
This is you.
It isn't.
- Just blow a little gently.
- Okay.
Don't get frustrated. Try again.
It's okay. I know.
- What do you know?
- I know that you're leaving.
And I know it's 'cause of me.
No, it's not because
of you, it's for you.
So how long will you
be gone this time?

If anyone receives this,
I'm the only survivor of a
long-range exploratory mission.
My ship was struck by an
undocumented asteroid belt.
I believe the debris to be a small cluster
from a much larger asteroid system.
But I can't be sure.
We've crash-landed on an
uncharted celestial body.
My ship has been
severed in half.
Confirmed nine escape pods have
been destroyed and two are missing.
The atmosphere is breathable.
All passengers are dead.
Send help.

Remember when we went to
the beach a while ago?
And do you remember
how, like...?
Just cold it was?
What does it feel
like out there?
Where are you?
Scanning for escape

Location unknown.
Where are you?
Section of the Zoic located.
Distance to escape

Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
What's your name?
Your name?
Okay. Let's find
out who you are.
Passenger number 35.
Your name must be Koa.
It's okay.
Here, let's look at this burn.
Koa, my name is Mills. I
was the pilot of the ship.
I was transporting you
home before we crashed.
And you've been in
cryostasis for...
a long time.
The navigation system is gone. I don't
know where we are. It's uncharted.
There is an escape vessel.
But it's high above
in the mountains.
That's our only chance to
get you off the planet.
There's something
alien out there...
that is dangerous.
You understand me, Koa?
I mean, it's Koa?
What'd you say?
What language is that?
Well, I can't...
I can't translate.
I don't understand.
No, I don't understand.
I can't translate it.
My translator's broken. Like
everything else on this damn ship.
What is that, Kuu'ri?
Pris'ka?
Mountain.
We... We must climb all the
way to the top of the mountain.
That's where the other
half of our ship is.
Ship.
Mountain? Do you
understand mountain?
Escape vessel. Here's
an escape vessel.
That's where we...
Over here.
That's how you leave.
- That's how you get home.
- Home.
What?
- Home.
- Yes.
Home.
What is it, your parents?
Family?
Family.
On the top of the mountain.
That's what I'm trying to tell
you. On top of the mountain.
- Family.
- Yeah. They're here.
Charter 3703. The daughter
of the Ona family is alive.
A child, maybe 9 years
old and in good health.
Her name is Koa, from
the upper territories,
so we are unable to communicate.
Her parents were passengers.
Both deceased.
I'm taking her to an escape vessel
I've located some distance away.
Send help.
Sending distress signal.
Yeah, that's a ship. Just like
the one you're driving for work.
Blast off!
I made it. Can you believe it?
School's been pretty fun.
I've been getting good grades,
and everything's been going well.
I miss seeing you
'cause I love you.
Hello. We have gotten
some amazing news.
It's made me very happy 'cause
you have made it halfway.
Here is your
halfway celebration.
I'm very proud on you...
Proud of you. For
making it halfway.
I think Mom told you,
but there's just a little minor
problem going on with me, so...
But it's actually really fun here
and I've met some nice people.
And they remind me of you because
you are my greatest friend, and...
Hurry back, please.
Speed it up.
I really hate you right now.
You don't even care about me.
Just want you to know I...
I love you.
I'm so tired, Dad.
I'm tired.
I'm try...
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
Stay with me.
We need to be quiet and
move to the mountain.
Quiet.
Quiet.
And move.
Move.
Keep moving.
Distance to escape
vessel, 12 kilometres.
Here, take my hand.
You okay?
All right, let's go.
Don't eat.
In your mouth down
to your stomach.
Shit.
Shit.
Hey!
No, no, no.
No. Hey! Hey!
Koa.
Leave it. Leave it!
Shit.
You have to listen to me.
You're gonna get
yourself killed.
I'm tired!
I'm just tired!
I'm just tired.
No. I'm...
I'm saying I'm just tired.
I'm just tired.
Want some water?
Water. It's okay.
Well, fill it up.
Fill it with water.
- Water.
- Water.
Here, go to the other
side where it's flat.
Water.
It's a flower.
- Flower.
- Yeah.
No, that's okay.
Flower.
Signal disruption.
Destination lost.
Scanning.
"Don't eat."
No, no! No, no!
Give me your foot.
Push. Push.
Run.
It's okay.
Are you hurt?
You all right?
Koa, we gotta go.
Move.
All right.
We'll wait.
Move?
Move.
We're safe now. You can sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Home.
Home is out there.
Irregularity detected.
Scanning to identify.
Unable to identify
irregularity at this time.
Could be more of
the asteroid shower.
What are you doing?
Why'd you take this?
Go to sleep.
And then I'll stick it...
here...
So now it kind of
looks like it's...
The wire makes it
look pretty nice.
But I'm just gonna add
this touch of red also.
She loved you so much.
She didn't suffer, she just...
She just slipped away.
Koa. Koa.
Koa!
You okay?
Scanning for alternate path.
Directional air
current detected.
Family.
Yeah, that's where we're headed.
To see your family.
No, it's not enough.
Mountain.
Move? Move! Koa.
I can't move a mountain.
Look, I can't. It's blocked.
I can't go any further.
I can't get past this rock.
That's it.
Mountain!
Koa. Koa. Mountain.
Move. Koa, mountain, move!
Move!
There's no one on that mountain.
I lied to you, and I'm
sorry. They're gone.
And you don't understand me.
No, I'm sorry. I can't go any
further. I don't have any more tools!
You all right?
Just in case.
Stay.
No!
No. No!
God!
Koa, no!

Koa.
Koa.
This is my daughter.
You understand?
The last time I saw
her, she was mad at me.
Because my job took
me away from her.
And when I was gone,
she got very sick.
She died and I
wasn't there for her.
I need to get you home.
Koa?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ready?
Okay, checking launch sequence.
- That's the launch button.
