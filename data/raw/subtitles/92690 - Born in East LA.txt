Oh, come on, Rudy.
Hey, I'm still
your manager, right?
Hey, Rudy, the car's back here.
I don't want to leave it here.
Rudy!
Hell, Jake, I ain't seen a
single living soul all morning.
Must have been
a fiesta last night.
They all overslept.
Yeah.
Oh, there's the first
customer of the clay.
Smile pretty, old buddy. You're on
Candid Camera. [Shutter Clicks]
Where is he?
Twelve o'clock.
Ah, yeah, there he is. Yeah.
I'm gonna get me some Z's.
It'll be a few minutes
before he gets here.
I'm gonna take a whiz.
