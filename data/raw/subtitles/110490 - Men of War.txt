[music playing]
Some people want
to talk to you.
In the back seat?
Yeah, asshole.
In the back seat.
Nicholas Gunar?
I'm Warren.
And, um, this is Lyle.
Hi.
How about we go to
a nice restaurant?
Get some hot lunch.
Whoa.
Don't shoot.
Got my lunch.
May I, Nick?
Jesus.
Where did that shit come from?
Sweden.
Like me.
We're businessmen,
Mr. Gunar, and we're
in the market for someone
with your special talents.
Actually, we're with the
Nitro Mine Corporation, and--
All he needs to know is
the color of our money.
OK, OK.
It's like we told you on the phone.
It's a pushover
of an operation.
In and out in no time
with no casualties.
I don't do that anymore.
Stay.
Stay.
This time, you'll be working
in a beautiful, warm, and very
tropical paradise.
I hate the heat.
Would it help if we
said who recommended you?
I know who recommended me.
I hear you've been having
more than your share of trouble.
Giving up the live can be
as dangerous as the fight.
I managed.
It's in our blood, Nick.
You can't do anything else,
because your heart isn't in it.
So tell me about the operation.
I trained you well.
Real well.
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't force your
enemy into a corner.
I mean, you leave them
a straw, a way out,
one chance of survival,
and the odds are,
he's going to take that
straw and withdraw rather
than fighting to the death.
Still preaching
Sun Tzu, Colonel?
The art of war
is the art of life.
You can't be a saint
in combat, Nick.
You wouldn't be
here if you'd done
truly reprehensible things.
I was a mercenary.
One can be a mercenary
and still a gentleman.
Why didn't you
recommend Keefer?
Keefer.
This op, from what I'm told,
isn't just slash and burn.
This one calls for
a touch of the poet.
Shit.
Job, man.
Job, job.
Can't hold down a fucking job.
OK, I'll get a job.
OK, I'll get a job.
Good morning, everyone.
90 minutes coming in
from O'Hare to the loop.
Can you believe that?
The Kennedy is jammed.
The Eisenhower's jammed.
If you're in a car
right now, tough break.
Ivan here, it's cold,
it's snowy, it's windy.
If you're going to work,
please be careful today.
It is dangerous out there.
Hell, it's dangerous--
I have a terrible paper
cut on my finger.
Is that blood?
What is that?
No, that's just some cream
filling from my bearcl--
Special Forces.
Got a job?
They say they train you for
a good job when you get out.
You know.
Be all you can be.
Well, I ain't seen a job
yet pay me what I'm good at.
And what's that?
Well, let's see.
I'm real good at jumping
out of a helicopter,
and setting up my
scope, then shooting
the spleen out of some foreign
motherfucker at 600 meters.
I guess they
don't need that kind
of help down at the 7-Eleven.
What color?
What color's people you
want me shoot at, man?
Lighter than you,
but darker than me.
I said just to shut-- shut up.
- Hey.
- Leave me alone.
Shut up!
- Jimmy.
- Shut up!
- Hey.
Come here, Jimmy.
- Hey, Nick.
How you doing?
Hey, relax.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Yet.
I've got a job.
I'll kill you, you bastard.
I know they're doomed.
You can see it in the eyes.
10, 20 years,
they'll be extinct.
I was surprised to hear
you're still breathing yourself.
The world is dying, Nick.
It needs a witness.
You interested?
What's the bottom line?
What are the odds?
20 to 1 you lose.
Oh, shit.
30 to 1 you lose.
53 to 1.
53 to 1?
All right, there you go.
All on me.
On who?
On me.
OK.
All right, fork
it over, old man.
Come on, give me my money.
Nolan.
Nick?
Nick the Swede.
How you doing?
Good.
Hey.
You're gonna best
your last dime,
might as well be
on yourself, right?
OK, everybody.
Listen up.
We're hitting a tiny
island at the edge
of the South China Sea.
The tribal council doesn't want
to sign over the mining rights.
We go in, lean on the
locals, and convince
them to sign the contract.
Our employers have promised a
$7,500 bonus per man once they
sign on the dotted line.
Sounds a bit
simple, doesn't it?
Did they say what the
mineral deposits were?
What they're paying
is none of our business.
Say, blondie.
Where does this ancient
piece of junk come from?
Sweden.
Like me.
What's up, my black brother?
I can kill a couple
of them with this thing.
You shoot at who I
say and when I say.
Nicky, what about the
native virgins, huh?
We pull in for
fuel at Puna Bay.
Puna Bay?
Say hey.
Keep your mouth
shut about the job,
I'll give you 16 hours
to get your rocks off.
Puna Bay is the
devil's playpen.
It's only a little gun.
It's not gonna hurt anybody.
Jeez.
Come on, man.
Hurry up.
Relax.
You kids take it easy.
Don't get into any trouble.
Don't shoot anybody while
I'm gone, all right?
I'll be right back.
You take care of these.
These are my babies.
It's got to be jade.
The stone of heaven.
Edge of the South China
Sea was never colonized.
There's trace deposits
of nephrite jade
all through these islands.
I'll bet these two yuppie
maggots hit the mother lode,
you know?
Where do you come from?
From here.
This town?
From this bar.
From down the hall.
Do you ever wish
it was like before?
Like before we came?
You want to fuck? $20.
You want to make friend?
Cost more.
No shit.
What time is it?
What time is it?
Can you tell me what time it is?
That fucks me up.
No.
Don't you understand "no"?
Hey, man.
Let her do her thing, all right?
Yeah, but who needs it?
Go.
Once.
Come on.
Hurry up, asshole.
Baby.
Mamacita.
Nothing with a hairy chest?
Beer.
Let go, or I'll
break your arm.
You can thank me later.
I was looking forward
to kicking his ass.
All right.
Fair enough.
But see, when I see
a woman in trouble--
You see an
opportunity to get laid.
Yeah, so you live
in this neighbor--
Look out!
Watch it!
Could use some
ice-cream right about now.
Get off me.
Get off me, you silly bitch!
What are you doing?
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Ocker, come on.
That's enough.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Look out, man.
Who the hell is that?
Now, who the fuck is
responsible for this mess?
Keefer.
So what is your story, bitch?
Hm?
I'm stuck on an
island run by assholes.
What's yours?
Well, I'm the Minister
of Defense, ain't I, baby?
We'll pay for the
damages, Keefer.
Well, well, well.
Nick Gunar.
This is good.
This is really,
very fucking good.
Murder is six months
for all you bastards.
And hard labor.
Nobody's been killed.
Well, I beg to differ.
Someone's been
killed, ain't they?
In fact, someone's
been fucking murdered.
You see that, Nick?
You fucking see that?
That was one of my best men.
Now you're all arrested.
All right.
This is between you and me.
Why don't we just
settle it that way?
You mean like hand-to-hand?
And afterwards,
we're all free to go.
Yeah.
Agreed.
Oh, by the way, there's just
one slight little ground rule.
This isn't, you hit me, I hit
you, you hit me, I hit you.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This is I hit you, I hit
you, I fucking hit you.
Every time he touches
me, kill one of his men.
Don't do it, mate.
We can take him.
With what?
Don't be stingy.
Rag.
Great reunion, Nicky.
Let's do it again sometime, eh?
There's something off
the starboard bow, mate.
Better take a look.
They could be tracking us.
Could be nothing.
Smugglers cruise these
waters day and night
with cigarettes and beer.
I don't care who the
fuck they are, man.
Blow them out of the water.
Clear.
You're wasting your rockets.
I told to stay below.
Even women need to breathe.
You know, since your target's
almost 600 yards away,
and that HEAT round you just
loaded into your Carl Gustaf
anti-tank rocket launcher
only has a range of 492 yards,
you'd be better off
saving it for something
you could actually hit.
I told you jerk-offs
she's a natural.
They're changing course.
Look, I can help you guys out.
And I can take orders.
I'll take the beaver sandwich.
Brief.
Grace Lashield.
Grace on the mission.
Her cut comes out of your pay.
Hey.
You dropped this in Puna Bay.
Special Forces.
Just another men's club.
Jade.
This is good.
This is so very fucking good.
All right.
Listen up.
Listen up.
It's 12 clicks across
at the widest point.
The whole east
side of the island
is rocks covered with bird shit.
There's a high reef surrounding
and the main village
1/2 click out from the beach.
The freighter makes its loop,
picks up Lyle and Warren,
and comes back in two weeks.
And after we hit the beach?
We introduce
ourselves to the locals.
You boys lost or what?
Hey, GI Joe, you got gum?
Hey, GI Joe, you got gum?
You back off.
Come on, back, back.
Hey, GI Joe, you got gum?
You know what I think?
What?
I think I'm gonna wind up with
a bone in my nose in a big pot.
Hey, GI Joe.
You got gum?
I tell them this is how
you say "hello" in America.
Some joke, huh?
So what are you?
You're the big
kahuna around here?
No way, Jose.
I'm just fishermen.
Speak a little English.
Po, uh, small potatoes.
You boys want to
stay here tonight?
No Holiday Inn on island.
We'll set up back there.
Tomorrow morning, you and
me will have a big talk.
You want some
company tonight, boys?
Loki.
Getting pretty
lonely in a jungle.
No.
I don't need any company.
Shit, I'll take her, Nick.
Listen up, everybody.
Stay away from us tonight.
We hear any creepy crawlers
in the bush, let's--
That was a good show.
All right.
Tomorrow morning, you
and me, small potatoes.
Hey, GI Joe.
You got gum?
Is he the chief?
Everybody chief here, boss.
One big happy family.
I told them what you say.
Village elders,
pretty heavy thinker.
They know the score.
Well, I hope so for your sake.
All of them gotta have
a chance for say-say.
Well, that could take forever.
That's just for say-say.
Then they start to argue.
It could take days and days.
Village elders big
pain in the butt.
It's your butt, not mine.
All right.
For now, why don't you
take me on a guided tour
of this shit pile?
Sure thing, boss.
Keep your eyes open back here.
Sure thing, boss.
Those frogs know how to shoot.
First blood.
So where'd you
pick up your English?
National Geographic.
They here two whole years.
Take a lot of pictures,
ask a lot of questions.
Po was native guy.
Hey, Po.
How'd you like to be
president of this rock?
Could arrange it.
Guys before
offered Po same same.
Who came here before?
Two fella.
I think they're name
Eddie Bauer and LL Bean.
Why they think Po
want to be president?
Well, you could make
decisions without waiting
for a bunch of old farts
to make up their mind.
You could be head of the Army.
No army here, boss.
Come on.
How do you defend yourselves?
What to defend?
Couple of tree.
Lot of rock.
Bird shit on everything.
Relax, boss.
You the mighty warrior, not us.
You're jerking my chain, Po.
You shouldn't do that.
Check this dude out.
Fucking useless, man.
Watch this.
Thank you, mate.
Come on, man.
Before we leave here,
I mean to find that jade
and pick me up a piece or two.
You know what I'm
saying, Blades?
We're gonna kick ass
and we're gonna leave.
That's what we need
to be doing, man.
Forget that jade.
Yeah, my luck has definitely
changed coming here.
Got a good feel about
this place, you know?
Tropical breezes, sandy
beaches, smiling natives.
Bullshit, man.
As soon as we let our
guard down they're
gonna fucking cut our throats.
Man, you gotta
chill out, Compton.
Get into the island
thing, you know?
Yeah.
Just like that.
On this island,
everybody do work.
You want to eat, you gotta work.
Yeah, well, if you
sign with Nitro Mine,
you'll have 100 nets like
that, filled with money.
Oh yeah?
What we going
to buy with money?
Buy food?
Got plenty food in ocean.
Maybe buy big American car.
She pretty funny, huh, boss?
Well, at least you don't
have to work to get the food.
And that's
supposed to be good?
Oh, Po get it now, boss.
You bring own bang-bang
girl to island.
Perimeter secured.
I laid out tripwires, flares,
a couple of claymores.
Claymores, boss?
You put bomb in the ground?
Just trying to
keep you honest, Po.
Listen to your mother, kid.
He's your son?
What'd she say?
She say you remind
her of her father.
Looks like you got
woman troubles, boss.
Nope.
No troubles.
No troubles at all.
You jerking Po's chain, boss.
You shouldn't do that.
Guys, uh, mind if I
get in on the action?
It's a Timex.
Did I win?
Did I--
I show you something
National Geographic never see.
If they were here for two
years, how could they miss it?
Some things island only
show to certain people.
Island want you to see this.
Ocker.
Ocker.
What are you doing here?
I just had a feeling
and kept on walking.
Who is this?
Whose fight is this?
The old people leave this.
Old people?
The people who
live here before us.
Oh, they all gone now.
Very fierce people.
Fight all the time.
All the time make big head
like this one to honor gods.
They fight wars
with other island.
Time come when they
fight each other.
Women and children
killed same-same as men.
People drink blood like water.
People live only for killing.
Old people are all gone now.
Turn to stone.
This face-- their face--
the face of the dead.
Welcome to our honored guests.
What is this?
Guest must be before
main course arrive.
Big honor.
Got feathers on it already--
have little tiny feet.
Very rare delicacy.
Just chew and swallow.
Is necessary for
all great occasion.
Man, this kook
is testing us, man.
Bottoms up.
Salud.
Mm.
My mother used to make
something like this.
You think I'm kidding?
Do you guys eat
these all the time,
or is it just for ceremonies?
Are you kidding?
We don't need that shit.
We did the same same to
National Geographic fella.
Some joke, huh?
You're full of
surprises, aren't you, Po?
Well, listen.
Let's get down to business.
Now, do you sign this,
or one of the old farts?
Nobody sign paper, boss.
You told me we'd get
the decision tonight.
I tell you the decision.
The decision is no.
You don't get it, do you?
Island spirit
help us to decide.
Island spirit heavy thing, boss.
You little prick!
Put it down, Blades.
They're fucking
laughing at us, man.
Put it down.
This island spirit ain't
shit compared to what's
going to happen to
you people if you
don't sign on the dotted line.
Tell them what I said.
Tell them what I said!
Grace, are you gonna
eat that, or what?
Claymores.
They hit the claymores.
Get down.
Get down.
Get down!
90 degrees left!
Blades!
Clear it.
Ocker!
Move up!
Go, go!
Stay down.
Stay down.
Stone of heaven?
Jade.
They came for the jade.
Jimmy!
Come on!
Clear.
Clear.
Jade, huh?
The beach!
Come on!
Let's go!
Get back in the treeline!
How many yards?
Breach!
400.
450.
460.
Come on, take the fucking shot!
Wait, it's too dark!
Flare!
490.
Take the shot!
Perfect.
Nice shooting.
OK, boss.
They understand now.
Everybody understand.
They know you're
going to shoot anybody
who don't do what you say.
He's right, man.
I think the rap
session is over, baby.
Look.
This your fault.
Any islanders who don't
live in the village?
A couple of mountain people.
Free spirit.
They don't like taking order.
They'll get used to it.
How long of a trip?
One day up, one day down.
Loki can take you.
If you like.
Strategically speaking,
it is a high ground.
OK.
But I'm leaving him in charge.
Do you understand?
- That's right.
Why her?
She the only one
who know the way.
Loki a mountain girl.
Mountain girl.
You know, you speak a lot better
English than a couple of weeks
leading National
Geographic around.
Po spend a lot of
time in San Francisco.
Busboy.
Mark Hopkins hotel.
Why not say so?
Po say that, you fellow
treat them like a busboy.
You ever been a busboy?
Painkiller, right?
I'll try anything once.
Play with this for hours.
Y'all grab whoever's
got the ball.
Ready?
Get down.
Get down.
Come on, now.
Two.
Hut.
Homeboy needs to be
doing his job, man.
I'll put $50 on the red team.
That's it, that's it.
All right, you go out.
Go on.
Where are you going, man?
Go down the sideline.
Get all the way down.
That's it, hold your hands out.
Catch it!
Catch it!
Nice catch, baby!
No!
No, run the other way.
Come on, big man.
Touchdown!
Yeah, punt the ball.
OK.
I'll give you two dick-licking
churchgoers the benefit
that you didn't know into whose
backyard you were sticking
your little weenies into.
Uh, well, we've
got to honest--
Oh, shut your fucking hole.
Did I ask you to be honest?
Huh?
Did I?
No.
That's right.
Because "honestly" don't
mean nothing to me.
I know your angle.
You hired Nick Gunar to
do a job, didn't you?
OK.
We'll hire you.
Yeah.
Tell me something.
Did you hire him?
No.
He's, he's my partner.
Yeah.
My point exactly.
See, you can't hire me,
because I am now your partner.
I'm sorry.
You don't understand.
You see, this is a
privately owned company.
And there's just
three shareholders,
and, uh, there's no room.
No room.
Oh, dear.
No room.
You hear that?
They said there's no room.
OK!
All right.
OK.
Well, it's about time
we found fucking room.
We will.
We'll call our lawyer
right now, and we'll
draw up a new contract.
Now, how about immediately?
Immediately.
Go get my business card out.
Right.
Yeah, my home phone
number's on the back.
And that there is my
little fax number.
And just feel free to
page me any time you like.
Night or day.
Thank you.
He like you.
Where's his father?
Gone.
Where?
There's a spirit called Auna.
He live in the sea.
And when he gets lonely,
he take somebody.
And my husband was fishing.
And he took him.
How old was he then?
Yap was still inside me.
If the Nitro Mine
people come, you'll
be able to buy better boats
and maybe your husband
wouldn't have died.
Auna wants you,
Auna come get you.
So where'd you learn
to speak English?
Up there.
There was a noise and
fire on the mountain.
And then, there is a...
Jellyfish in the
sky, hanging down.
It is a man.
- Your father?
How long was he here?
He's still here.
In the air.
In the tree.
In the water.
He never left?
He want to go.
He felt unhappy until he hear.
Hear what?
Island voice speak to him.
Show him how to fish.
Show him how to smile.
How to speak to island people.
My mother want to know if you
fall from sky with jellyfish.
But I tell her you wash
up on sand like garbage.
Thank you.
Those marks mean all
the people he kill.
Each mark means one, maybe
more places he drop fire.
Must have been good.
You mean at burning people?
I burned people.
Learned I was good at it.
Just like your dad.
- He stopped.
I tried, but I couldn't.
Why?
It's the lifestyle and money.
How much money they pay
you to burn our island?
I don't want to
burn your island.
But you will if
they pay enough.
You're a pain in the
ass, you know that?
My-- my father say same thing.
Sh.
Listen.
Been a long time I
hear mountain sound.
Different spirit live up here.
Wake up, bitches.
We've got [inaudible], come on!
Get your ass up.
Hey, listen up, you
little pissants.
You've been operating
on our time.
But now we're operating
on Blade's time.
Yo.
Come on now, Compton.
Come on. Move, doggies.
Doggies, doggies, doggies, move!
I said, move!
I said move!
Move, move!
Now sit down!
Right here.
I said sit down!
Move!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!
Sit down!
Sit down!
Down, down!
Get down.
Get down!
Don't look at me.
Don't fucking look at me.
Sit down!
What?
What's this?
Oh, you want me to play
ball with you, is that it?
Not now, little man.
I'm working.
Nice hands.
Nice hands.
Yeah, yeah.
Put it over there.
Yeah.
Right there.
Why are you doing this?
You should have waited for Nick.
What makes you think
he's coming back?
OK, everybody.
Everybody!
Listen up.
This is how the story goes.
You sign your name
on the dotted line,
or I'm gonna burn this
fucking village to the ground.
You hear me?
The hell you doing?
Drop it, bitch, or I'll
blow your head off.
Let her go, you son of a--
I'll kill you, useless.
And then I'll blow her head off.
Relax, man.
Hey, watch it, Blades.
Back up, pops.
Back up.
Back off, pops!
You want a hand?
You got a hand.
That's enough, Blades.
Back up!
Hey, what is this?
Make them stop.
Your move, boss.
I didn't sign
up for this shit.
They're asking for it, man.
They're fucking asking for it.
OK.
Everybody back off.
Come on.
Damn it, man we're
being paid to do a job.
Let's do it, man.
Kids don't make
me no difference.
Put the gun down, Blades.
Get us fired, punk!
You're paid to do
what I tell you to do.
What?
That's bullshit.
You're a fucking pussy.
Oh, yeah?
I'm the pussy?
I'll fucking blow
your ass away, man.
Blow me away, then
nobody gets a fucking dime.
You want your bonus?
Huh?
You want your fucking bonus?
Man. Come on, brother.
Walk with me.
Come on.
It's all right, girlfriend.
It ain't over.
- Come on.
- It ain't over, girlfriend.
It ain't fucking
over, girlfriend.
Come on, walk
with me, brother.
Walk.
That's right.
It's not.
All right, everybody, get back.
Back to alpha.
Get out of here.
Come on.
Today village
decide, we no sign.
Tomorrow we decide,
you shoot us all.
You ever been to Puna Bay?
Mm-hm.
We rather die
than live like that.
Well, if we don't
do it, they'll
just send somebody else.
When someone else
come, we talk to them.
Now we talk to you.
Check it out, Swede.
Here come your
floating pink slip.
Make a decision.
What exactly are
you looking for?
Maybe we can work a deal.
Bird shit.
Bird shit?
Are you deaf?
That's what we're after, Nick.
nitrogen by-products.
Builds up in the bird
shit for centuries.
And these people,
well they got tons.
When the first bird
dropped its load,
it picked this island.
Pterodactyls came here
to do their business.
Now we're coming
here to do ours.
You understand that,
you stupid moron?
We scrape off the top of the
island, and what do we have,
Lyle?
Caves.
Thousands of caves.
And you know what that means?
Bat shit.
Even heavier quantity
than the stuff
up top, and twice
as rich in minerals.
When we're finished,
it's just going
to be a hole in the ocean.
We can make you a very rich man.
You want me to kill
people for bird shit?
Why not?
You've done it for less.
Blades.
Buddy.
Say what?
Get your bonus.
All right.
As of now, I take
control of this island.
Anyone who fucks with
it fucks with me.
If you want to stay, stay.
If not, you're off this
island in five minutes.
No weapons.
Pay's on the ship.
Go fucking die, punk.
Get in the boat.
Nobody tells me what to do.
Get in the fucking boat.
Relax, Compton.
The man don't bluff.
Punks.
Man.
Come on, homeboy.
Let's get out of here, man.
Found the jade, didn't you?
There is no jade.
It's the bird shit.
Bird shit?
Yeah, right.
What do you think
I am, an idiot?
You sure you know what
you're doing, blondie?
We'll see.
Sellout motherfucker.
I'll be back, man.
I'll be back, Uncle Tom.
Hang out with Casper that's the
wrong person to hang out with.
Casper, Uncle Tom, I'll be back.
This ain't my home, Nicky.
And these people,
they ain't my family.
I thought you
made a commitment.
I made a commitment
to do a job.
What are you, kidding me?
Nobody takes my babies.
Come on, Gracie.
Go if you're going, Jimmy.
I'm staying here.
Say what?
I saved your ass.
I'm the one who got
you this fucking job.
Sorry, Jimmy.
Do you believe this shit?
Man.
Uncle Tom.
I'll be back.
Bald head.
You have man in America?
Nobody special.
I never saw the appeal
in somebody permanent.
Who you care for?
Nobody.
It's going to be
awful, you know.
When your friend come back?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Po?
Loki?
Anybody?
You don't need to yell.
Where is everybody?
They are with the dead.
The what?
You follow me now.
"Heart of Darkness," mate.
Under island full of cave.
All the cave connect.
Come out all over island.
Tonight, we sleep
here with the dead,
call for the spirit of
war to come inside us.
Dead who killed in
battle rest here.
Battle?
A map of the tunnels?
Bullshit map.
If enemy find, he
goes wrong way.
Deep shit.
Real map up here.
For 100 years, chamber of
dead used only for ceremony.
Now we use again for war.
Spirit has been
gone a long time,
but you have brought
it back to us.
We will fight.
Like the old people?
Old people story is bullshit.
We are the old people.
You look good.
You look healthy.
Nick.
What we've got here is
an unwinnable situation.
I don't suppose I could convince
you to walk away from all this.
No, I didn't think so.
A man has to have
something to honor, Nick.
Now, all I got left is my word.
I gave my word.
What are you giving?
These people trust you.
You've chosen to
take their trust
and lead them into extinction.
And where is the honor in that?
You honor them?
Nitro Mine?
Nitro Mine is those two idiots
back there on the freighter,
and that's it.
Well, I do have a piece
of the action myself.
Congratulations.
Oh, that's the world, Nick.
Keefer?
Yeah.
The three of us,
back together again.
Better to keep an army
intact than to destroy it.
So long, son.
You know, I envy you.
You're going to die for
something you believe in.
I'm going to see you
in hell, Nicky Gunar.
There she is, boss.
Right I found her.
Sun Tzu.
Who?
Merrick left me a straw.
A way out.
If you want to leave,
boss, I understand.
Come on.
There goes your
ride home, boss.
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
That's 50, including Jimmy G,
Nolan, Blades, plus those two
old friends of yours.
Could be worse.
Start calling range.
You got it.
Off the lead boat, count.
I got 265.
260.
55.
50.
Rip them up.
Yeah!
It's all clear.
Nobody's home.
Hey, be careful!
This whole area's mined.
She moved the fucking mines.
Bullets are cheaper
than medics, ain't they?
Got a real crackerjack
team, huh, Colonel?
Bring up the rear?
You stay up with me, son.
What's the body count?
13.
All ours.
What were you doing all day?
Finding tunnels.
Bastards.
We took out more than
1/3 of their forces today.
That's not good enough.
Come on, blondie.
That's pretty damn good.
Merrick wanted to
know where we were.
Now he knows.
Now, we put the charges in the
holes and we blow the tunnels.
No, that's not any good.
We want the tunnels intact.
Oh, Jesus.
What the fuck are you
wasting my time for, Colonel?
You listen to me.
You don't go off on me.
You understand?
The caves are loaded
with minerals.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, sir.
It's all right.
There's a lot of ways to
flush a rabbit out of a hole.
And it takes a few casualties.
He might get careless
about the rest.
Tomorrow, I'll
give you bodies.
Move.
Let's smoke them out.
I promised you
bodies, Colonel.
Yeah.
They'll be falling apart now.
Nick will dig in.
Give them time to
lick their wounds.
Tomorrow we strike.
They find this
tunnel, we're cooked.
How are we doing?
How the hell you
think we're doing?
Running low on ammo.
Well, I'm the only
one they want dead.
No.
Nobody give up.
Damn straight, blondie.
- We're in it all the way.
- So?
What do we do now?
We have to take
them all out fast.
Burn it now, Colonel?
Torch the village!
Into the jungle.
Are you bloody ready?
Son of a bitch.
Look, it's a safe place.
We could die doing this.
We gotta leave, we gotta--
Good job.
Good job.
Way to hit him.
Way to-- you too.
Now listen.
Y'all stay here.
I'll be right back.
Got it?
I go.
You stay.
Now, you try to hide yourself.
Try to hide.
All right?
This ain't no game, y'all.
What's up, little brother?
Big brother.
You sellout motherfucker.
Get off of me!
Fucking get off of me!
Get off of me.
Bust your head--
Hey, Nick!
Cute kid.
Why'd you come back?
You know me, man.
Got to go with the odds.
You don't have to do this.
'Course I do, Nick.
You're a wanted man, you know.
$10,000 dead or alive.
I want to know what
they're looking for.
You mean they still didn't
tell you about the bird shit?
Bird-- the bird shit.
So long, Swede.
Who taught you how to do that?
Get down.
Get down.
Stay down.
Meet me at the stone head.
Nick.
Where you at, baby?
Nicholas!
What is this, some
game you're playing?
Hide and seek?
Well, I'm about to
seek your ass out!
You want a gunfight?
You got one.
Stupid piece of shit.
Come on out, Nick!
Come on!
Just me and you!
Come on, Casper!
I told you can't kill me!
Yeah, come on, punk!
Don't sneak up on people.
Shit.
I'm out.
Why do you always think
I need you to save my ass?
I can't help myself.
Why don't you trust me, Gracie?
Because you're on
the wrong side, Jimmy.
I'm on your side.
Prove it.
Shit.
Carl Gustaf rocket launcher.
Swedish.
Nice touch.
I taught you
everything you know.
But not everything I know.
Should have taken
that straw, Nick.
Ah.
Don't you come any closer.
Nicky.
Colonel.
Kinda reminds you of
Angola, doesn't it, Nicky?
All that burning flesh.
God, I was afraid
I'd never breathe
that smell again, Nicky.
You're not like him, Colonel.
You're an honorable man.
My honor is to my job, Nick.
You should know that.
Job over.
Can stop now.
It's over.
You're kidding,
right, Colonel?
Well, you're not going to
walk away after all this.
After we won the fucking war.
There is no war.
Do you understand?
It's over.
I gave you my fucking heart.
You were like a father to me.
Welcome to hell.
Fuck.
Well, I guess Chicago's
gonna be pretty cold.
Maybe.
Maybe for some.
Where are you going?
Home.
Where's that?
Don't ask.
See you in the next one.
Say-- yeah.
Soldier.
We have a legend.
It tells of a man who come
from far across the ocean
to save us from great danger.
Really?
No.
But I'm working on it.
