"Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"
'This is Rocky.'
'When the world sleeps...'
'...well, he doesn't,
nor does he let the girls sleep.'
'Right now he's standing here...'
'...but his friend Kanhaiyya
is standing somewhere else.'
O Lord Krishna,
I don't want a two-minute noodle...
...but someone who
can give me eternal love.
I'm not looking for TP, but 'BP'...
'Beautiful Patni' (Wife).
Hear my prayers O
Prabhu...O Deva (God.)
Mister, currently Maggie
and BP can be banned any minute.
Even Rajnikanth can't
help you on this.
All the best.
Yesterday I met a man...Mr. Popat.
He deals in girls.
Popat's going to introduce
me to a beautiful girl.
I've an idea to make
a macho impression on him.
Mr. Baig.
popat.!
Hello, Mr. Baig. - Mr. Popat, welcome.
I was waiting for you.
Where is the stuff, show me!
Mr. Baig,
I've bought the best stuff for you.
Once you see it, you'll pounce on it.
What a big variety...I must say.
We've got Russian,
American, Italian...
...and even the local stuff.
But Mr. Popat,
you said your business is 'Supplying'.
Yes, I did. And in laundry supplies...
...you also get traditional attire,
kurta...and more.
You said you wanted a suit,
so I brought you a suit.
Look. - Bloody cheat.
You awakened my dormant desires.
I will bury you alive.
Old man...now I
understand your demand.
Bloody pervert.
Pervert...
- Who are you calling pervert?
It's been so long since
I asked for a coffee.
Who's is this? - It's fresh.
Give it to me.
Hello. Hi.
Good morning, sir.
'There was Mr. India who could
be seen only through red color.'
'And there's Kanhaiyya, who
goes cockeyed whenever he sees red.'
'No matter which color
of red he sees...'
'...original or dyed,
it makes him cock-eyed.'
Focus. Focus. Focus.
Good morning. Good morning.
May I...come...in, sir?
- Yes, come in.
Sir sent me to you.
So that I can take it...
Your..
..Notation?
Oh, I see.
So...how are you going
to take the notation?
However you want to give it.
I mean...notation.
I'll give it verbally.
But I'll hold it in
my hands and then take it.
What? - Your cell...phone.
Phone. - Give it to me.
Kanhaiyya, the delegates are here.
Bring the presentation to
the conference room in five minutes.
Okay, dad. Okay.
Kanhaiyya, focus. Focus.
Focus, Kanhaiyya.
We have only five minutes.
Come on, baby.
I don't want to do this.
I am looking for true love.
True love. Move aside.
I'll give you true love.
Kanhaiyya. Don't leave me and go.
Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen.
Our company,
Lawman pg3 has only one motto.
'Excellence
The talent of making
jeans runs in our genes.
And my son, Kanhaiyya Lele...
...is assisting me in it.
So Ladies and Gentlemen,
tie your seat-belts...
...and be ready for
a fantastic presentation...
...of Sanskar...Range
of traditional wear!
These photographs will
give you all a clear image...
...of how we can make
a backdoor entry in the market.
To capture this virgin market.
- How did this happen?
...is our goal.
This next image will show
you the steps we've taken...
...to escape the booby
traps of the market.
These traps... - What's coming here?
What is all this?
Did you do something?
- I didn't do anything.
Silence please.
What is this, Mr. Lele? Look behind.
Kanhaiyya!
Is my picture printed in the Lokmat.
- Shut up, Rocky.
Everything went haywire today.
Dad's very angry.
My dear cock-eyed Kanhaiyya.
Focus! Focus!
Even he knows what happens
when his dear son sees red.
The problem is your cockeyed.
How long can he stay angry?
Tonight, when your granny turns 69...
...you can convince him. - Yes.
Only granny's 69th
birthday can save me now.
I wish that you and aunty
stay happy together forever.
Kanhaiyya,
you should start calling me mom now.
Aunty's are as good as moms.
I know I didn't raise you.
But after sister passed away...
...I did change your soiled pants too.
Yes.
No need to pamper this useless fool.
I told you to get the cake.
Didn't I?
Rocky's bringing it.
Everybody, the cake's here.
Come, come. - Everybody come.
No, no, not you.
Granny, come.
My 69th birthday cake! - Yes.
One...two...three!
Isn't it just perfect?
Isn't that good? Isn't that good?
no, no, no, no.
What's this?
I gave you two a small job...
...but you couldn't do that either,
you fools.
But uncle,
what's wrong with this cake?
What are you saying?
Look...
It's granny's birthday,
not Shakti Kapoor's.
Now we'll have to do this job.
Me and your mom will have to go...
...and get a decent cake.
Until then you take
granny to the temple.
Okay, fine. - Come on.
You couldn't even get a decent cake...
...at least you could've
brought a decent gift.
Gift? Where will I get a gift now?
There's Passmyorder.com..
Shopping plus saving. - Yes.
It was so nice, so big.
Granny...tonight when you turn 69...
...we'll give you a bigger surprise.
- Really?
Let's go to the temple now. - Okay.
This website's amazing.
Done.
Gift shopping's done. What now?
"Rocky."
No one's at home.
Let's give my thing some overhaul...
...so that it functions
properly when needed.
Desi Pop Corn.
Hot version of Bollywood films.
This seems new.
'Hag Rambo hag'
(Wake up Rambo Wake up}.
'Rocky'
"Run Rambo Rum."
See, doctor.
Rambo's always running.
And no matter how hard I try...
...it doesn't wake-up.
Please do something.
Otherwise my youth will go to waste.
Rambo will wake-up, that's my promise.
Formula 36.. 24..36
Wake up Rambo! Wake up!
Come on, Rambo.
Oh no. Now there's
just one cure for it.
Nurse Laura.
Yes, Dr.
Waghmare. - Come in, nurse Laura.
How can I help you?
This man has...two
low parkinson's disease.
Cure him!
Give it to me.
Push it.
Give it to me.
"Wake up...Rambo."
I am awakened.
"Wake up...Rambo."
Oh my god
Come, granny.
Rocky!
What's this?
Rocky, what have you done?
You killed granny on her birthday.
Rocky!
Your father shouldn't have chucked
you out for such a small thing.
After all...you're a
cannonball from his cannon.
If you hadn't shot from
your cannon and killed granny...
...then I wouldn't have been orphaned.
Let's just forget what happened.
I was with you that day,
and I still am.
Shoulder to shoulder!
It takes only a second, a minute
or an hour for bad times to change.
See...the phone's ringing.
Hello.
After all these years.
It's Mickey from Thailand.
Mickey. - Yes.
No, buddy...we're in a bad condition.
What?
Really?
What are you saying?
Of course.
Done, bro. Done. Thanks.
What happened? What did Mickey say?
He said that our
fate's going to change.
He's offered us a job.
He wants us to go to Bangkok...
...and give him a hand job. - What?
I mean...give him a hand in his job.
Help him out.
I see. - Yes.
What job?
- He didn't say that.
But he said his business
is 'Give and Take'.
'Give and Take?' - Yes.
Rocky, I hope we don't
get stuck in a mess.
Whatever it is,
I am sure it's better than this.
Yes. - Instead of rotting
in Madh Island, let's go to Thailand.
And Mickey's guaranteed...
...that we'll make
loads of money out there.
Bathe in champagne.
Moe. - Moe.
And he also said...
...we'll ride with girls in a big car.
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."

"I am your man, be my queen."
"You do as you please."
"I guess this is heridetary."
"Who are you waiting for?"
"I know darling,
you want to lock eyes with me."
"But you never admit."
"Why do you beautify yourself?"
"Your beauty's hi fi,
and I'm a naughty boy."
"And we're going to enjoy all night."
"Wearing my Lawman,
I am good looking."
"Let's get surrender to each other."
"Zoom in with your eyes,
and wander around."
"Don't stare at my
waist with your eyes."
"It's the heart's dirty thinking."
"It's the heart's dirty thinking."
"But listen to your heart
if you want to have fun."
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."
"O Madam. your youth."
"O Madam. So crazy."
"O Madam."
"Looking at your beauty
I want to quench my thirst."
"Not just a drop,
I want to drink the entire bottle."
"You're my Romeo,
I'm your Juliet take me in your arms."
"I want to live with you,
and not go anywhere."
"I miss you all day."
"I miss you all day."
"And kiss your cheeks."
"My Youth..."
"Youth's ruined me."
"Youth's ruined me."
Excuse me.
Yes. - My seat's there.
Can I? - Yeah, yeah, of course.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
I think that's my seat over there.
Yeah, yeah...sure.
Pillow please. - Pillow please.
Here's your pillow ma'am. - Thank you.
Excuse me,
can I also have a pillow please!
Thank you. - Welcome.
Thailand, here we land!
What's that?
'Welcome to Suvana Bhoomi
International Airport.'
"How cool we are, how cool we are."
"How cool we are, how cool we are."
Rocky, Mickey said 8 o'clock, right?
"Bad boy."
"Bad boy."
What the...
Brother, so nice to see you.
Looking nice. - Great.
Looks like you two shaped up.
You two have changed a lot. - You too.
Chain...leather...biceps.
My entire life has changed.
Let me show you how. - Okay.
You've ruined my life, Rajjo.
- I love you so much.
And you doubt me.
Shut up! What kind of love is this?
What the...
I will slap you.
Shut up. - You can try.
I am a Punjabi too. - Shut up.
Brother. - Yes, brother.
What's going on?
We've been married
for only three months...
...and she already
gave birth to a child.
What? - Right.
How long have you been married?
- Three months.
And you? - Three months.
And when was the kid born?
- Three months.
Total.
Total...
Total... 3+3+3...
Rajjo, that's nine months.
Time just flew by, forgive me.
You suspect me for no reason.
- Sir, thank you.
You just saved my marriage. - Yes.
6609823... call me.
Come on,
let's plan for the second one.
I am really proud of you today.
Even though you stayed
out of our country for so long...
...but you haven't
forgotten our culture yet.
You'll be blessed.
You just saved a marriage
from breaking-up.
He hasn't changed at all.
He's still the same.
Buddy, I didn't do some good deed.
I did this for my own benefit.
You didn't get it?
He'll never understand.
Come on, son.
Welcome to the new exciting life.
- Thank you.
But tell me something,
what do you exactly do...
...and what do you want us to do.
Yes. - It's a surprise.
A surprise that will
change your lives.
Just like Sunny Leone's
changed after she came to India.
Kaushaliya baby.
Darling meet me tonight,
I'll make you big star.
Mickey, you've an amazing life.
This was just the trailer.
The door to heaven open from here.
Welcome.
This is my studio. - Nice place.
And I do all my work from here.
What work? - Everything.
You'll find out.
You guys are going
to have a lot of fun.
Lot of fun!
"Now that you've pinched me..."
Today I am going to
teach you three things.
Entertainment.
Entertainment.
Entertainment.
Me first.
Me first.
Don't make a noise,
or I'll punish you.
Cut...got the shot. Moving on.
Hey, Merili.
Hi, Mickey! - Meet my friends,
Kanhaiyya and Rocky.
And this is my heroine...Merili.
It's a...real pleasure...meeting you.
Did you see my shot? - Yes, we did.
Superb shot. - Was it fun?
Why is she talking like that?
- No, no.
Don't be scared.
She's very good actress.
Method actress.
She's been doing the
same role for three years.
She's so into her character...
...that now it's difficult
to come out. Right, Merili?
Yes.
Madam is ready.
Meenamma...this is
my new encyclopedia.
H for... - Harder.
F for... - Faster.
L for.. - Longer.
Focus! Focus! Focus!
No, Meenamma. No.
You've jumbled up all
the meanings in the dictionary.
I love it.
It's your fault.
Where did you buy
such a stupid dictionary
I think I've seen her before.
Give it to me push it.
Nurse Laura.
I didn't know that
such big incidents...
...happen in such big cities.
Don't underestimate
the power of common man.
"Lungi Dance."
"Lungi Dance."
Yeah!
"Lungi Dance."
Cut.
Hey, Mickey.
What a shot, Tarzan.
Darling.
Hi, Mickey! - How are you, Saku?
What a hot shot?
Meet my friends.
This is Kanhaiyya and Rocky.
Sakuntala.
You mean Shakuntala.
No, no, she's Sakuntala.
Her pronouncitation are off.
She pronounces S as Sh.
She's Saku.
But calls herself Shaku.
Thank God she doesn't
say Sh instead of F..
F...
Is she alright?
- No, she isn't alright at all.
When she gets in the mood...
...she starts touching herself.
Madam's in the mood.
Someone take he shot.
I am coming, - Go, go, go, on.
Come there.
- But...what's going on here.
You two are doing really great, guys.
Hi!
Hey, who are these two?
They are my childhood friends.
Kanhaiyya and Rocky.
And guys,
they are my brilliant actors.
Wow! They are so cute.
Especially this one. - Get lost!
Don't tease him too much.
He's fresh stuff...I
specially imported him.
Hold on.
Are you going to replace us with them?
My beauty, don't cry.
I am not going to replace you.
There's still lot
of light in your lamp.
That's true.
These two are here to...
...fill my and Saku's life
with light from their candle.
Candle?
How could you imagine...
...that we'll say
yes to such a vile idea.
I thought you two are
tired of doing good things.
Now you'll do some bad things.
Aren't you ashamed? You make BP.
Not BP...DP. - DP?
Yeah...Dirty Picture.
Tell me something,
why do you want us to do this.
What's so special about us?
Darling, you two have that...
- X factor.
No! Max Factor.
You two might have forgotten...
...but I can never forget that day.
Remember that pool
party on my birthday.
How's that crow standing on water?
God blesses people with a big heart,
or big brains.
But use your brains...and
question your heart.
What did God bless you two with?
What are you two staring at?
I admit I make dirty picture.
I make boys and girls
strip off their clothes.
But I use that money...
...to provide clothes
for the children of Somalia.
You see all the wrong things I do.
But you're ignoring the fact...
...that I give jobs
to poor Indians everyday.
You two can think whatever
you want about me.
But in my view, I don't make porn...
...I do a good deed.
He's right.
And anyway,
Kanhaiyya, we don't have a choice.
We cannot go back home.
If we want to do
something big in life...
...then we must do this.
We both posses a special talent...
...conferred on us by God.
We shouldn't waste it.
Have you lost your mind, Rocky?
You can go ahead
and do this if you want.
But not me.
Since childhood,
we did everything together.
We lived together...boozed together.
We swung together...and
even shagged together.
Are you going to leave me alone now?
Look around you.
You'll definitely
see a sign indicating..
...that we should sign Mickey's film.
Yes...
Look at that flower, that's a sign.
What sign?
Focus, Kanhaiyya, focus!
Look, Kanhaiyya.
The clouds are giving
you a sign and blessing you.
Say yes, Kanhaiyya. Say yes.
Say yes, Kanhaiyya.
Say yes.
Yes.
You can do it. - Yes.
Say yes.
Yes. - Say yes, Kanhaiyya.
Yes.
Set ready? Light ready?
Switch on the projector.
Chinki clap.
'Kholay' shot 1, take 1.
Action!
I am tired of driving my cart alone.
I thought Chiru will drive it for me.
But he left me and ran
away with that tall guy.
It's worth a thought...
They were just friends at first.
But now...they're
more than just friends.
What do I do?
What do I do?
Kasanti.
How about I solve your problem?
How, Faakur sir. You don't have hands.
Stop shoving that thing in my mouth.
Point it there.
Chabbar!
For miles and miles away...
...on the eve of Holi.
Every mother says...
"Go to sleep dear."
"Or else Chabbar will
come here with his water-gun."
"When is Holi?"
"When is Holi?"
Kasanti. How many were they?
I don't know.
I can't count beyond 50.
Kasanti,
don't play Holi with this dog.
Okay, Faakur.
Let's toss for Kasanti. - No.
You toss. Do it. - No.
No!
No!
No!
Faakur sir.
Your hands...and you're holding guns.
Yes!
"When is Holi?"
"When is Holi?"
It's right now.
Cur!
Fantastic! Pack up!
Hello sir.
Two ice-creams, please.
Cone, please.
Thank you.
"Love is God's boon.
Love is a festival of the heart."
Here you go.
No!
"Love is like the dawn."
First eat the ice-cream
and then eat her.
I mean watch her.
Here.. - You're just...
Listen. I'll be back
from the bathroom.
Listen, don't go anywhere.
Stay right here.
Fine, I heard. I'll stay right here.
I'll be back from the bathroom. - Go.
"My love for you selfless."
"My love's selfless."
"My love for you selfless."
"My love's selfless."
No, no, no...
Disgusting.
What are you doing?
There's a mouse in my pant. - Mouse?
In your pant.
Stop laughing.
I wonder where she went.
Rocky...it's love at first sight.
Who? The mouse?
No, that girl.
But...I wonder what she
might be thinking about me.
She must be thinking that
you like playing like kids.
And maybe if she likes
playing with kids...
...then you've found your true love.
Shut up.
Stop trying to turn this U-rated
love story into an A-rated one.
Not every girl is a sex-object. - Yes.
Even I have a dream,
that I have a perfect wife.
And I can settle down with her.
Perfect wife. - Yeah.
In Bangkok,
you'll definitely find her.
Let's go find her.
But let's go for the
shooting before that.
Mickey's waiting for us.
Come on. True love!

Go back, or you'll die.
Stop. - Stop.
Oh, God!
Stupid.
But I didn't do anything.
Poor guy.
No!
Hi. - Hi.
You didn't fall
intentionally on that girl.
Yet she slapped you.
That's my luck.
That day,
when I was eating ice-cream...
...a mouse got into my pant.
But until I got it out,
you were already gone.
I am so sorry.
Then you misunderstood
me in the lift as well.
I am really, really sorry.
I thought you're Shakti Kapoor...
...but you turned about
to be Tusshar Kapoor.
It's okay.
Everyone thinks my
dad's Shakti Kapoor too.
I am Shalu.
So how can I makeup with you.
You can make-out with me. - What?
I mean...you can go out with me.
Oh...
Coffee or dinner, whatever suits you?
Can we go out on a date?
Never delay a good plan.
Of course I'll go on a date.

Bro, I am nervous.
Kanhaiyya, focus. Focus.
Come on. Do something.

Stay on?
Yes.

Yes.
Will you be the mother of my kids?
What?
I mean...
Will you marry me?
If your answer's yes...
...then please accept
this valuable gift.
Lucera. Wow!
Lucera diamond!
Lucera's diamonds are quite big.
And you said your family's rich.
Then why such a small diamond?
My mother always said...
"Son, when a girl's
impressed by small things..."
"...later she's really
happy to see bigger things."
Big or small,
I want everything you have.
Of course I will marry you.
Action!
Come here.
Come on.
Bloody fools, oafs.
Blow it on those two, not me.
How about me?
- No, you don't blow anything.
Just go and stand there.
You baldy,

Come on, one more.
Action!
"The body shivers...heart quivers."
"When he comes... Pingum."
Bloody baldy...you
fool...zoom on them.
Who are you?
One with the biggest chewing gum...
He can only be...Dajirao Tingum.
And you?
His sequel. Tingum Returns.
Returns!
Returns!
Hey...
I am coming!
Now mine's...dangling.
Excellent shot!
Very nice.
I'll make the next film with you two.
London Dreams.
Brilliant.
Done, bro.
What's wrong with him?
Hello. - Hi.
Shalu, hold on.
Shalu's phone. Keep quiet.
Yes, Shalu.
What are you doing?
I was watching television.
I see...but I don't
hear the television.
Television... I've put it on mute.
I was changing the channel. - I see.
Are you worried about your obesity?
Don't give up.
Even I was over-weight.
But now...I've lost weight.
See...
Crispy potatoes.
Crispy potatoes.
Crispy potatoes.
Don loves wild cats.
Wild and juicy.
"Baby doll made of gold."
"Baby doll made of gold."
Wow...there are many
exciting things on TV today.
Yes...the television's
really nice today.
Okay...I called to tell
you something important.
Lower the volume. - Yes...
"Baby doll made of gold."
Kanhaiyya,
I talked to my dad about our marriage.
And he now wants to meet your family.
What?
But my family isn't here right now.
Then call them.
You said that you will manage.
Look, my dad is believes
in culture and family.
Until he doesn't meet your family...
...and know them better...
...he won't agree to our marriage.
After that...you can
ask father for my hand.
Why just your hand...I
want all of Shalu.
By the way, I knew about culture,
family, values...
...but I didn't know
your father will be...
...straight out of
Suraj Barjatiya films.
Yes, you got it right.
But my father's Karjatiya
and not Barjatiya.
Surya Karjatiya.
Karjatiya?
Yes.
When does he want to meet my family?
This weekend, on Saturday.
Bye.
Saturday.
Why did you tell her that you're rich?
And your family will
cross the seven seas for you.
Don't you remember...
...no one intervened
when you were thrown out.
What did you expect me to say?
That my father kicked me out.
And now I am acting in porn films.
Yes, I don't like to lie.
But this time I lied for my love.
What will you do with your love...
...when your lie's exposed?
You'll get sc*** trying
to get your family.
Where will get your family?
Kanhaiyya, you can have a family.
But you must plan for that.
Family planning. - What? Are you mad?
Mickey, are you crazy?
You mean your actors...
...will pretend to be my family?
Forget it,
I'll think of a different option.
You don't get it.
Come here. Come here.
Look.
Look at them carefully.
What did you say?
No, no, this is bulls***
It won't happen.
Don't listen to him.
Look at them carefully.
- No. This won't happened.
Let him visualize.
"Sister, your crazy brother-in-law."
"Flirts around with girls."
Yes, you're right.
It's a brilliant idea. - Yes!
Yeah!
I think it's brilliant too.
You won't find such pious bonds.
What say Kanhaiyaa?
Sucku and Merili will
be my sisters. - What?
Sisters.
And these two will
be my brothers-in-law.
Hold on. Who will play
the role of your father?
What?
I am still young. No!
You'll be perfect.
- Shut up. What perfect.
If we're caught, we'll be jailed.
And I am too handsome to be in jail.
If I drop the soap in the shower...
...I won't be able to face anyone.
To hell with you two...I
am going. - Rocky.
You and your family drama.
Rocky, listen. - It'll be brilliant.
Who will play the
role of your father now?
How mean, Kanhaiyya?
Do I look as old as your father?
You just have to pretend as my father.
Done.
I can do anything for you.
Thanks. - Someday I'll
have to be someone's father.
I'll begin with you. - Yes.
Bless you, son. - Get lost.
Listen. This won't be easy.
They are all cheap actors,
and not theatre artists.
We'll need to train them.
- Yeah, you're right.
But I'll direct this film.
Done. - Done.
We can do it.
Action.
Karjatiya...if you don't
let your daughter marry my son.
I will shoot you.
What are you blabbering?
Son, I love you from my heart.
Mickey, heart's on the left side.
I keep shaking all day...
...so my heart keeps
moving left and right too.
And this is nothing.
Yesterday my kidney
slipped down to my foot.
I had to pee from my toe.
Look Sucku,
from today I am your small brother.
Small brother! - Behave yourself.
You've to pretend as my sister
in front of Karjatiya family.
Okay.
Yes, sister. Okay.
Come on, now go and wear some clothes.
More clothes? - Sucku, please go.
Come on, go.
What are you wearing?
Sari. Why? Am I not looking nice?
Why are you wearing it like that?
"The buds and stars, they all say."
"I've never worn
so many clothes before."
Yes, fine.
But whatever you're wearing,
please wear it properly.
Okay. Now, go.
Hello. - Hello.
What do you do?
Our business is Give and Take.
Sometimes we take...
...and sometimes we happily give.
Oh my, God.
My marriage lies in your hands.
Please don't ruin it. - Okay.
Go and practice for
your role properly.
Go.
I don't know what's going
to happen about my marriage.
Tradition, Honor and discipline.
These are the three
rules of Gurukul...
...which I can't follow myself.
So why would I tell
my son to follow it.
I know, I'll tweet your marriage.
Shalu weds Kanhaiyya.
Mickey, stop joking around.
You haven't prepared
for the role of my father yet.
Don't worry,
all I have to do is put on a wig.
I'll be an ideal father...
...and Shalu's father
will be surprised.
Hello, Karjatiya uncle.
Would you like some tea...or biscuits?
No, no, no, no, Merili, stop.
You will only offer tea
to my future father-in-law.
Nothing more.
And no showing any skin.
Come on, repeat your lines properly.
Hello, Mr. Karjatiya.
What would you like to have? - Good.
What would you like? - Look, Sucku.
Be serious guys.
If you do anything wrong...
...then I'll get divorced
before getting married. - So sad.
Don't stare, take my blessings.
Greetings. - Bless you son.
What?
Kanwarlal. Oh, sorry.
Karjatiya.
You'll have to let
your daughter marry my son.
One day this boy will bring
Ekta (Unity) in this world.
"I am a traveller, friends."
"I've no home or place to stay."
"I've to keep walking."
Ekta.
"So cool are we."
Not like this.
Wear it properly.
Like this. Properly.
Keep your veils in place...
...in front of my
future father-in-law.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
And yes, repeat your names once again.
Chu...Chusil... I mean Sushil.
Sanskaar. - Yeah.
Sakshi
Sunder.
Remember them, don't forget.
Where the hell's Mickey.
Feels like he has arrived.
All the best.
Come on, guys. We can do this.
Hello. Please come in.
Hello.
Kanhaiyya, this is my father.
And he is? - Shalu's father.
No, no, I was talking
about your parrot.
Oh...
If you're talking about
the parrot then look at him...
...why are you looking at me?
My name's Prem.
Father, Kanhaiyya has a problem.
Whenever he sees the color red...
...his eyes become talking
China looking Tokyo.
Kanhaiyya, focus. Focus. Focus.
Where's the rest of my family.
They'll come later. - Okay.
Please come in. - Yes.
Come in.
Come.
Greetings, father. - Bless you.
Come, sit.
No, I can't do that. I can't sit.
Why? - Father has a problem.
Due to an injury to the spinal cord...
...he can't sit or sleep.
That's why I always keep standing.
And my parrot also
keeps standing with me.
Right, Prem?
Prem.
His name's Prem.
Prem Karjatiya.
Your parrot's quite big. - Yes.
When I was small, so was he.
As I grew big, so did my Prem.
And my late wife
loved Prem more than me.
Is this your family? - Yes.
This is my sister, Sanskar. - Hello.
And that's her husband Sushil. - Wow.
Sanskar, Sushil...really nice names.
Very traditional.
What do you do, Sanskar?
Well, I give...
What do you give?
Education to poor kids.
Inspiration to widows. - How nice.
And to bachelors...
Besan (Flour).
They deal in gram flour.
Sweet meat, flour...
He's a master in
everything that's besan.
Oh, I see.
Even I love 'Besan'.
You should let me try
your 'Besan' some day too.
Of course.
Whenever you feel like...
...I will...fulfil your desire.
Why she breathing so heavily?
Asthama.
Sometimes my wife
gets asthama attacks.
Kanhaiyya,
why is she scratching herself?
Well, she's my other sister Sucku.
I mean Sakshi.
And sometimes she gets an allergy.
And that's why she
starts scratching herself.
Don't worry about her.
She'll get better.
And who's this young man?
This is her husband, Sunder.
Hello. - I see...
Does he do the same business
as your other brother-in-law?
Yes.
You got it right.
We lend each other a
hand in the family business.
Wow.
I love the family that works together,
eats together...
...and sleeps together.
Prem...don't worry.
He's just laughing.
Where the hell is Mickey?
- Where's who?
I was just saying...
...I am so glad to meet you.
- Me too, son.
But I don't see your parents around.
Well...
Son, here I am.
He's here.
Shake it Daddy.
You are... - Pop.
Kanhaiyya's father.
I see. I am really
glad to meet you. - I see.
Glad to meet you.
Even my parrots happy to meet you.
Wow, your parrot's quite big.
Greetings, uncle.
- No, no, darling. Come here.
I was waiting for this day.
She is very soft.
What are you doing?
Don't hit on your
future sister-in-law?
If you hadn't shown up...
...and you would've definitely
arrived for my final rites.
Wow! Nice! Very nice!
Look at the budding father-son love.
And they're so sweetly
whispering in each others ears.
That's Sanskar (Values).
Did you...call me?
No, sister.
He was talking about
'Sanskar' in general, not you.
By the way, Kanhaiyya...
...I haven't seen your mother yet.
Mother?
Mother? - Mother.
Mother.
We don't know where's her mother.
It's a long story. - Yes.
Long...very long.
Son! - Who's that?
I am here.
Rocky!
"Rocky. . Rocky"
"Rocky. . Rocky"
Kanhaiyya, let's run away.
Who are you?
- I am Kanhaiyya's father.
Oh, God! Another father.
Daddy?
You're his father, he is his father...
...so many fathers.
I am the father...that
gave birth to him.
And he's the father
who raised him. - Yes.
That's why he considers
us both his father.
And not just us...
...he considers all the
men in this world his father.
Daddy!
Wow! - Wow!
Your son has such great ideals.
If everyone thinks like your son...
...then everyone in the world
will treat each other as siblings.
But, tell me something.
Sanskar and Kanhaiyya
look like brother and sister.
But she doesn't look
like your daughter.
Her...
We adopted her when
she was very small.
Who's my...
Daddy.
Children will always remain children.
You should take rest, I am very tired.
What? - I mean you must be tired,
because of the long journey.
Sakshi. Go show them the bedroom.
Bedroom?
Anytime. It's my favourite place.
Actually,
please don't show them anything.
I think he's getting another attack.
Brother-in-law, you show them the way.
Yes, let's go.
Yes, of course.
Come, I'll show you your bedroom.
They're gone now.
Pathetic actress...
you're going out of character.
Lock her in the bathroom.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Where did you come from?
I am your friend.
How could I leave you dangling?
Who is it now?
I'll go take a look.
Why are you going inside?
Who are you?
- What language are they speaking?
Look, madam.
I think you're in the wrong film.
Everything already quite fishy here.
"I am saying that
I am at the right place."
"I'm aunt Sindoor,
Karjatiya's widow sister."
Oh, hello. Hello.
If she was blind too...
...she could've played Rani
Mukherjee's part in 'Black 2'.
"You won't know the worth
of a pinch of vermillion, mister."
Hey mister, listen here.
We don't understand
your nonsense at all.
First you blabber something,
then this dog barks...
Hey, his name is Sakru.
Wow, then he'll come in handy.
Anyway. ..
First he barks, and then you bark...
I mean you speak after him.
I mean what's this threesome.
You see, Sakru understands
what Sindoor aunty says.
And I understand what Sakru says.
There's only one hero
amongst all these villains.
Who is he?
Why don't you go up?
No, no. I meant the
room besides your brother.
Brother-in-law and sister,
take them inside.
Hello. - Come, come.
Who could it be now?
Whenever this bell rings...
...there's always
some kind of trouble.
You shut up. - Wait, wait.
Go see what new problem is it now?
Oh my, God.
Why are you giving expressions...
...like it's a big problem.
It is a big problem.
My real father's here. - What?
But who gave him my address? - I did.
What?
As your friend, I called
him up and told him everything.
What? - He yelled at me and hung up.
I didn't know he'll
come here personally.
That's why I came here dressed
as your father, to help you out.
Our entire plan is ruined.
Couldn't you find a better
time to show your friendship?
Sorry, buddy. But don't open the door.
Or else it'll become
a triple role of your father.
Should I let them stay outside? - Yes.
Your aunty will like it. - Get lost.
They'll pop it for a while,
and then leave.
What? - The bell.
My father won't leave so easily.
He'll come in and pop us.
Who would know that better than me?
What.
Someone's ringing the bell...
...and you're not opening the door.
Guests are like God, son.
Open the door.
- Open the door.
This guest will surely send us to God.
I was about to open it.
But either the police or the
beggar rings the bell for so long.
Police won't come here.
So I thought it must be beggars.
Beggars are also a effigy of God, son.
Okay, I'll open the door.
- No, no, no.
How can you open
the door when I am here?
You're elder to me.
I'll open the door.
You go inside, go on.
These things have no
connection with age, son.
Come on, I'll open it.
Welcome.
Hello. - Hi.
Come in. - Mister,
you look from a descent family.
So why do you carry
these big suitcases and beg?
I had heard about
International Khiladi (Player).
But this is the first time I
saw an International Bhikari (beggar).
You are a beggar,
you and your entire family.
Do I look like beggars to you?
My name is Mr. P.K. Lele.
And that handsome
boy standing there...
Look here.
I am his father.
Oh, God! Another Pop!
Mister, don't forget your manners.
This handsome boy
you're talking about...
...I am his future father-in-law.
Surya Karjatiya.
Kanhaiyya...he's your father...
...he's your father
and he's also your father.
So many fathers? - Speak up.
Yes...and no.
That is my mother.
Kanhaiyya, what's going on?
Which fathers is he talking about?
He's talking about your sins.
Let's go now, I'll explain you later.
Go get some rest first.
- Where are you taking us?
Why was that old
man calling me a beggar?
Bloody old man.
Kanhaiyya.
Why did you lock them up in the room?
And what's this exhibition of fathers?
No exhibition...
He's my step-father.
Step-father? - Yes...didn't
I tell you it's a long story.
My mother, who was first my aunty.
He's her husband.
My step-mother's step-husband...
...which is my future step-father.
But unfortunately, my step-mother...
...has come here with her boyfriend.
You mean your aunt's your mother now.
Yes and no.
Actually...my aunty left
my father for her new boyfriend.
Yeah... I didn't get it.
Wait, son. Whatever you said,
please explain hat in Hindi.
Basically, father...Madhuri
has left Monish Bahl...
...and going around with Salman.
Oh, then say it like that.
Now I get it. - Right?
But what can be done now?
Your father is crazy
about your aunty...
...but she hits on other guys.
I can understand your emotion.
But why did your father
lock those two up in the room?
Well...well...
Because I knew that my father...
...wouldn't be able to see
my aunty with her new boyfriend.
And if anything happens to him...
...then I'll become
fatherless instantly.
Papa!
How sad.
I am really sad to know...
...that someone's trying
to have fun on your expenses.
Kanhaiyya's aunt is at fault too.
If she hadn't fallen...then
this would've never happened.
But I've compromised with the fact...
...that what's done is done.
Someone else slept with her.
But how can anyone sleep
with her other than me. - What?
I mean...I will awaken her. - Who?
Her love...
The heart that once beat for you.
That's rituals,
that's values...and that's tradition.
But you don't have too long. - What?
No, I mean you're here
only for a short time.
You'll fix their marriage and leave.
No!
No! - No!
Now...I'll leave only
after fixing all the relations.
My daughters...as well
as my daughter's mother-in-law's.
Come, dear.
Let's go.
We're sc*** because of your father.
Now he wants to unite your aunty...
...with your real father,
who's actually a fake. - Yes.
Until now I called her aunty...
...so how can I call her dear.
You stay away from her.
So what if she isn't my real mother.
But even she has
changed my soiled pants.
I will stay away.
But that Karjatiya will
keep trying to bring us closer.
Whatever...
Your aunty looks like a MILF. - MILF.
'Maasi I Love to Facebook!'
What did you think?
I am saw
Kanhaiyya open the door.
Open the door, or else your
father will knock it down. - Open it.
Don't you know my power?
Open the door or else I'll break it.
I will break it!
"To make a flora out flowers..."
"To make a flora out flowers..."
"One needs some silk, and some glass."
If you hadn't caught me,
I would've fallen down.
How could I let you fall?
After all you're Kanhaiyya's aunty...
I mean his mother.
If I was falling down,
you would've caught me too.
First you fall...and
then watch how I catch you.
Stop behaving cheaply.
And tell me, son.
What's going on? - Yes.
Why did you lock us up?
To save you an aunty
from Karjatiya's parrot.
Yes, his parrot's so sweet.
Shut up.
And stop praising other's parrots.
He goes crazy when
he sees boobsurat...
...I mean Khoobsurat
(Beautiful) women.
Yes!
Dad, I locked you inside to save
you from Karjatiya's pervert parrot.
Yes!
Sir, that parrot's got
a bad reputation in Bangkok.
Yes!
Do I look like a parrot to you? - Yes!
No, no...
Stop making a fool out of me.
And tell me, son.
I don't see your
scoundrel friend Rocky.
By the way, I wouldn't have
come here if he hadn't called me.
And why wouldn't I come.
After all...I am your father.
"Rocky. . Rocky"
His face reminds me...of Rocky.
Rocky?
Rocky who?
He was a shameless and cheap guy.
He turned his
granny...into super-granny.
I mean she's dead.
Is that what happened?
Rocky...
How can my face look like him?
Look. How this possible?
Look.
Yeah...that's really big.
Oh my, God. Sorry, sorry.
No problem. - How stupid of you.
I forgive you.
By the way, son...
...why was karjatiya
calling him your father?
Father? No? He's my boss.
Since I came here,
he's treated me like a son.
He recognised my
talent that you didn't.
And that's why, for Mr. Karjatiya...
...he's like my father.
By the way,
is he actually someone's father...
...or is he still a bachelor?
Why are you eager to know?
- For general knowledge.
Generally your general knowledge...
...is limited to the bedroom.
By the way, son...who's this Nepali?
He... - I am the guy
who recognised his talent...
...which even his father couldn't.
So...he's like a father to him.
Yes.
And what about the
others that were here?
We're the front-end,
and they're back-end.
And together we lend
each other a hand in our job.
What do you guys do?
We've a huge factory
of Organic Sandwich.
We all roll over each
other and work together.
Do come some day we'll
let you lick the sauce.
You must be tired,
I'll go take some rest.
I mean you must be tired,
go get some rest.
Come, let me show you your room.
Come.
Go on.
Sauce... - Yes. Mine's already out.
Kanhaiyya's aunty is
openly giving it to me.
Line.
Kanhaiyya's step-mother...
...wants to make you her lover.
She's in full mood to
sing a duet with you. - Quiet.
Don't say this in front
of Kanhaiyya. - Why.
He'll break my bones.
Let him play his flute with his Radha.
"I am crazy Karimi."
"I am single and lonely."
"I am crazy Karimi. - O Boy."
"I am single and lonely. - O Boy."
"I am a hot cracker. - O Boy."
"I am like Lady Gaga. - O Boy."
"Give me... Give me."
"Give it to me."
"Will you give me your heart."

"Come on everybody shake it!"
"Come on everybody do it like I do!"
"Like the sexy lady."
"Handle with care..."
"...I am fragile item."
"We'll spend the night
in the candle night."
"I'll start with
slowly-slowly touching you."
"Don't pretend,
you're a master in this."
“Baby, baby...“
"You're my baby."
"From now I'll be your soft toy."
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

O Boy... You're my soft toy."
"Love in the air..."
"...darling, feel the ambiance."
"Get ready, we're going
to love each other awesome."
"There's an intoxication
taking over me."
"It's a short game,
but it's lots of fun."
“Baby, baby...“
"You're my baby."
"From now I'll be your soft toy."
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

O Boy... You're my soft toy."
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."
Look, he's snatched our
peace and sleeping himself.
Get up.
Son, lift up your a”
If you keep dreaming all day...
...then your dreams of
becoming rich will shatter.
What do you mean?
I mean...the client's giving
me sleepless nights for a new DP.
Please explain him.
In my line of work,
the competition is tough.
And for this job,
I only need two things.
Camera and room, very simple.
Wait a minute.
How will you shoot a
film in all this confusion?
Don't worry.
I'll shoot so secretly,
that no one will know.
Kalim...an ordinary girl like her...
...can't become the empress of India.
Champakali is not some ordinary girl.
She's a virgin.
Beautiful, capricious and alluring.
If you can give her
your royal piece...
If that's the case...
...then I won't bury her in the wall.
In fact, I'll take her to heaven.
Come on, baby.
I am scared, your highness.
When in love...no need to be afraid.
Cut. Cut. Cut.
What's the secret code?
Go take a look.
Kanhaiya, you?
You're shooting Mughal-e-Azam...
And father's waiting
at the dining table...
...to have Mughlai food with everyone.
Just five more minutes,
we're at the climax.
Hurry up. Hurry UP-
Wait.
What's the secret code?
That must be Sucku.
Only she makes sounds like that.
Take her in. - Yes.
It's the deaf aunty standing outside.
I hope...she didn't see anything.
And if she did,
she'll go blind with shock.
Hide. Everyone hide. - Hide.
Rocky, idea. Idea.
Say it. Say it.
No overacting...careful.
What's going on here?
Actually...we're doing a play...
...for the Indian
organization of Bangkok.
Pavitra Rishtey.
We were rehearsing for that.
Yes.
But what was that girl
doing bent over before him?
She...
Actually, she's washing
her father's feet before dinner.
Normally we wash our
hands before a meal...
...who washes their feet.
In our family,
we wash everything before a meal.
Why?
Because...before eating our meal...
...we join our hands
and thank the Lord.
Because God's revered through
a clean mind, and clean body. - Yes.
Lord, help us.
"Radha's incomplete without Shyam."
“Say Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.“
"Radha's incomplete without Shyam."
Even after living in Thailand...
...you didn't forget your culture,
rituals and tradition.
This has made me really happy.
Why don't we all go
for a picnic tomorrow...
...so that we get to
know each other better.
There's another thing I
would like to share with everyone.
My dear sister, Sindoor...
...who lost her voice and
her husband on her wedding night...
And I've always seen
disappointment on her face...
...and tears on her face.
But years later,
I can see a smile on her face.
And only..
"Radha's incomplete without Shyam."
"Say Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."
"Radha's incomplete without Shyam."
...that she's sitting
here with here, with us.
And I believe...that the
love between us should grow.
All I want is that
we all live together...
...just like in Suraj
Barjatiya's films.
And we all progress together.
I'll go get the sweetmeat
for you and Kanhaiyya's mother.
What? - No, no...
I'll get sweetmeat for everyone.
Hello sir.
This mixture will
bring the spice back...
...in Kanhaiyya's father
and aunty's shattered love life.
The sweetmeat's here.
Serve it to everyone.
Hurry up. - This is for you.
Thank you.
This is for you. - Thank you.
The sweetmeats really nice.
What's wrong with you today?
You're not getting tired.
Plan successful.
Who could it be at this hour?
I'll see.
Kanhaiyya's aunty.
Hide under the building.
Building? - I mean hide under the bed.
Hide, hurry up. - Okay.
Where's my moustache?
What are you, doing here at this hour?
You called me here...
...and now you're asking
what am I doing here?
I called you.
Naughty boy?-
Let's have some fun.
"I've found the gem of love."
That was Kanhaiyya's voice.
What are you doing here?
Kanhaiyya, open the door.
Hide, hide... - Kanhaiyya.
Father. - Is everything fine?
Yes. - I heard you scream.
No, father, nothing to worry about.
Go and sleep. It's quite late.
I'll sleep too. - Yes.
Okay. - Early to bed, early to rise.
Come on, baby.
Come. - What if someone comes here?
We'll get in problem.
- No one will come.
We will come.
Look, Kanhaiyya will never forgive me.
I want you to have
a relation with him...
...which even his father couldn't.
What relation?
As a friend. - I am his friend.
I mean I am also his friend.
Then come on, let's turn
this friendship into something more.
No, please.. - Right now.
Shalu. You know the red color...
What are you doing? - Sorry.
I didn't mean that.
No, no, no.
You're okay? - Focus. Focus. Focus.
Kanhaiyya.
What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.
Come on, baby. - Not now.
What if father comes back?
- I don't care.
Since I saw you...
...there's just one thought
that crosses my mind.
Which one?
"Let the dawn not rise."
"Let's not lose this night."
"Let's not let each other sleep."
"I am you're hero?" - Yeah.
That's my favourite film.
I'll go get the DVD right away.
Where are you going?
- I'll go get the DVD.
All I want is that you
and me are locked in a room...
...and the Key's found.
- You mean lost.
Yeah, yeah...whatever."
Let's go, Prem.
Why are you following me around?
I am going to sleep.
You go sleep too...with this Sakru.
Sorry.
Goodnight.
I told you father will come back.
Now hide, hide.
What are you doing outside
my room at this hour?
Your aunty...
What happened?
- Your aunt's in my room.
And she's hell-bent
on making me your father.
10 minutes more, and 9 months later...
...our kid would call you brother.
Rascal, did you do
something wrong with her?
I wouldn't be here if I wanted to.
Come, I'll show you.
Yeah!
Early to bed and early to rise.
Makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
Father's coming...this
way with his parrot.
Where did he come from?
Want to have some fun? - Yes.
Take him with you.
Lights off, pack up!
How did the lights go off?
Come on, I'll show you.
Strange.
I heard a commotion and light.
What happened suddenly?
See.
See. - Yes.
Such nice people.
Noble. Courteous. Cultured.
Right, aunty.
What are you doing here at this hour?
I...was looking for the bathroom.
I will have to take a bath.
Watching my aunty behave so cheaply...
...makes me want to puke.
I am sure Karjatiya is behind this.
Otherwise my aunty would
never do a thing like this.
We must stop Karjatiya at any cost.
Otherwise...aunty will
try to rock my world every day.
We must make that
old man understand...
...no matter how hard he tries,
it won't kindle aunt's flame for me.
How's that?
"Rocky."
By telling him...
...the one holding my rolling-pin...
...is another Vidya
Balan in my kitchen.
Another Vidya Balan?
Yes. - I didn't get it.
I mean my fake girlfriend.
Fake girlfriend? - Yes.
I mean your fake second step-mother.
Now watch...how I turn
your family's clean picture...
...into a dirty picture.
"Rocky!"
Of course, darling. I miss you too.
And I love you too.
Yes, yes. Don't worry, I miss you too.
Darling, I must go.
I'll call you later.
Okay, love you.
Who were you talking to?
I think you're hiding
something from me.
You're absolutely right.
I was hiding it from you.
But what to do, love is such a thing.
No matter how hard you try,
you can't hide it.
I didn't get it.
That was my girlfriend. - Girlfriend?
I love her...and I'm
soon going to marry her.
And so I have a request.
Please don't try to reunite
me and Kanhaiyya's aunty..
...I mean my first wife.
There's no place for her in my life.
Prem, another mother.
I wonder how Kanhaiyya
will handle so many mothers.
Well, okay.
I would like to meet
your new companion.
What?
What's the point
of meeting her? - What?
Satisfaction.
The woman who's going to
be my Shalu's mother-in-law...
...I must know her character,
her lifestyle, and her mannerisms.
What do you care about her character?
Why wouldn't I be?
I want to handover my
daughter to your son happily.
Do one thing.
We're all going for a picnic.
Bring your new girlfriend
there in one hour.
One hour!
One hour!
One hour!
How's that possible?
Rocky, if you don't introduce
my future step-mother...
...to my future father-in-law, then...
...he'll never give me his daughter.
No worries...no problem.
If you can have two fake fathers...
...then can't you
have a fake step-mother?
Mother?
Jimmy, I doubt this
old hag's intentions.
I think she'll spare
me only after give and take.
Did you tell anyone anything?
What's she saying?
I was looking for your
room last night? - What?
What?
What's she doing?
I want to take a
jet-ski ride with you.
Who will go on a
jet-ski ride with you?
Not me, she's saying it.
And you can't say no to Sindoor aunty.
Who can avert destiny.
Come, I'll take you.
That was fun, dear. - Yes, it was.
Look, Mr. Karjatiya,
I've brought my Vidya along.
Focus. Focus. - Focus.
Father.
You look...
Look... - What?
You look just like Shalu's mom.
What? - What?
Yes.
You reminded me and my
parrot about Shalu's mother.
Naughty. - No, honestly.
Look, this is her picture. Look.
Ooh la la!
What's this new twist?
You look just like
the old man's dead wife.
You look like...a blossoming rose.
Like a poet's dream.
Like the sun's rays,
and a doe in the jungle.
1942... A Love Story.
No... 1972... A Love Story.
That's when I saw Shalu's
mom for the first time.
And now it feels...time
has turned back again.
I think we should split too.
Are you okay?
God's ways are unique.
You really reminded me...of my mother.
Mom!
Dear. Dear.
Father, where did Kanhaiyya go?
I'll go take a look.
Shalu baby...
I mean dear...
Don't...don't leave me alone.
Vidya, that reminds me.
You had to go somewhere.
You have an appointment in
the parlour, right? - Yes, of course.
"Don't leave me yet..."
"...because my heart's
not satisfied yet."
You must do it with me today.
What? - What?
Lunch. - Naughty.
Lalita.
My name's P.K. Lele.
Nice to meet you.
Who's this pretty damsel?
This is Vidya, my girlfriend.
Excuse me.
But I think I've seen you before.
This is a very old pickup line.
But it still works.
Don't be fooled by him.
If you dig this mountain,
you'll find a mole.
She won't find a lion in you either.
Let it be, Mr. Karjatiya.
I must leave now.
My home is really far.
It'll take me three
hours to get there.
By the way,
I don't see our son Kanhaiyya.
We can't let Vidya
go until he doesn't arrive.
How can he come when
I am here? - What?
I mean...how can
he come when I am here.
I sent him to the nearby mall...
...to get medicines...for my stomach.
No. we'll all go to the mall,
find him...
...we'll have lunch and then go home.
No, no...
Let's go.
Go on. - Let's go.
Vidya... - Come on.
Mother...
I mean your aunt's got her eyes on me.
She keeps hitting and winking on me.
My own father was hitting on me.
I told you to use lemons.
But no, you wanted oranges.
Now you pay for it.
If I knew this would happen...
...I would've used grapes instead.
What happened? - Look.
The old man's here.
- He's my father-in-law.
It's the same thing.
We must do something now.
Come on.
Vidya.
Hi. - Vidya.
Vidya. Did you find Kanhaiyya?
- Not yet. He must be around.
Even we're looking for him.
We'll find him. We'll find him.
And then we'll say...
He was right here,
and we looked all over the mall.
Mr. Karjatiya,
we couldn't find him on this floor.
Let's go look for him
on the next floor. - Yes.
No, no, no,
let's go in this shop first.
We'll buy some religious
or family films.
Come, dear.
They won't find any
religious or family films...
...instead they'll see the
real doings of our fake family.
Yes.
Before father catches us
red-handed with our pants down...
...let's do something. - Come on.
Oh, no.
Every corner of this store...
...is filled with evidence
that we've been sleeping around.
Rocky...we must handle this. - Wait..
Let's buy all these DVDs...
...before father sees them. - Yes.
Let's eradicate this
problem from the root.
Excuse me.
Welcome!
"I am the button of your shirt..."
"Beloved."
Hey...what are you doing?
Pack the DVDs.
Are you Indians? - Yes, so?
No, looking at her I felt that...
...we have some old connection.
Yes, did you forget?
We were together in part 1 and part 2.
How can I forget those two parts?
Hey, I think you've a lot of...
This is part 3.
Come on, pack the DVDs.
Okay good choice sir.
You're a fan of these two.
Me too.
I can't sleep without
watching these two.
You see...they lighten my burden.
Yeah!
Hold on, what are you doing?
Store-policy, sir.
You see, madam.
Until we don't check the
DVDs in front of the customer...
...we can't pack them.
Hurry UP-
Hurry UP-
Hurry UP-
I am, sir.
What happened?
Sorry, sir.
I think this is a bad stock.
I can't sell you this pile.
Come back when we get the new stock.
We'll buy the new stock as well.
But if we don't buy these now...
...we'll be in big trouble.
Pack these DVDs immediately.
- Are you sure, sir?
Yes.
Pack all you have. Please.
I can even pack myself for you, madam.
Pack the DVDs now. Hurry up.
Yes, I am.
There she is. - Let's go that way.
Come on. - Hi.
Here. . have...
Here...
For a special customer. - Ooh la la.
What are you doing?
Sir, let me pack it properly.
I am packing them so sweetly.
Hurry UP-
Pack it quickly.
I am, sir.
If you take any longer...
...then we'll have to pack up.
Please, give it to me. - It's done.
Hurry up. - Madam, packing..
Give it. - It will tear.
The DVDs are coming out.
Satyanash. (Curses).
What? - What?
Satya Nash, that's my name.
Your name fits your job.
Bloody villain.
- Shut up you two, shut up!
That's Kanhaiyya.
Welcome to Maa Jagat Sajni's court.
And that's Kanhaiyya's
sister...Sanskar.
Look there,
That's Rocky and Kanhaiyya.
What are they doing?
What no one ever did in our family?
These DVDs are working.
I've seen this film 25 times.
What a performance.
Why did you bring
these transistors along?
To play.
Pervert boys.
I always knew...he's useless.
You make it sound as if...
...you've done big things in life.
- Shut up.
Blue film actor.
They turned out to
be uncultured and cheats!
Do not climb up here.
This... This...
Are these your values?
You really are the family
that sleeps together.
Tell Kanhaiyya that
I would rather die...
...then let my daughter marry him.
Then I should die.
But..
Why is Vidya going to commit suicide?
I canceled Kanhaiyya's wedding.
It's the same thing.
Vidya.
I am coming too.
- Where are you going?
Get lost. - Wait.
I guess we'll have
to do a part 4 for him.
Oh...
Welcome.
Stop, Vidya. - I don't want to live.
Vidya.
Stop. - Stop. Stop.
Vidya, stop
Stop.
Vidya. - Vidya..stop.
I don't want to live. - Stop!
You.. - Get lost.
Kanhaiya, stop.
Vidya, stop.
I don't want to live. - Listen to me.
Stop, Kanhaiya.
Kanhaiya.
Don't go there!
That's my son Kanhaiya.
Kanhaiya. - Stop. Stop.
I don't want to live.
I'm sinking in quick sand.
I'm really going to die.
- I told you not to do it.
We'll get caught. - Forget that.
Get me out of this quick sand.
I don't want to die.
Get me out of here.
- Give me your hand.
Oh my, God. I am sinking too.
Oh my, God. Help. Help, help!
Such a big deceit.
Deceit. Deceit. Deceit.
This is terrible.
I am sinking too.
I was trying to make my
daughter's husband her mother.
Forget that, we're dying here.
Kanhaiya, you toyed around
with my heart as well.
Someone save me.
Prem, save me.
I am just a parrot, not God.
I don't want to die.
Prem, do something.
Okay, I'll do something
Aunty, where were you?
Papa, save me. - Help! Help!
Someone help him.
Forgive me, son.
I should be ashamed of myself.
You were thinking
of making him your wife.
But me, his father..
I was thinking of making
him his mother. - Papa..
That means..you're
Kanhaiya's real father.
Yes, I am his father.
But I am a big sinner.
Then who's this fake father?
Even his moustache is a fake.
That's Rocky. Kanhaiya's friend.
I was so stupid..
I tried to make my son's friend..
...his father. Help!
Every father thinks..
...that his son-in-law will be a gem,
But you're a gem..
...that's been used like
Kohinoor with who knows whom.
No Kohinoor.
Whenever we had sex, we used Durex,
And he didn't do anything wrong if
he showed his anaconda to the world.
Not every Simran gets his Raj.
Sometimes we have
to settle for Nagraj.
Here's the Nagraj.
Shalu, we've been deceived.
Kanhaiya, you're Vidya?
I did this for you, Shalu.
Sindoor, stay back.
Sindoor.
Sindoor.
Aunty!
Please help.
Hey, Father no.1.
Come quickly.
Hey guys, hold on.
What's Karjatiya's parrot doing here?
Everyone's in danger. Come quickly.
Helm - Help!
Somebody help!
Father.
Kanhaiya. - Help!
Come on. Quickly.
Come on, come quickly.
Kanhaiya, no one's going to die now.
I'll save everyone.
Everyone go to hell.
Hey, Comedy Circus, come down quickly.
One balloon saves you from AIDS..
...and this balloon
will save your lives.
Balloon!
Balloon!
Balloon!
Stop screaming and yelling.
Catch it now or you
won't get a second chance.
Here you go, Kanhaiya.
Catch it.
Catch it, fast.
Yes, father. Carefully.
Come on, go father.
Come on father.
Come on.. Come on.
Brother!
Sindoor..spoke.
Aunty?
Aunty. What just happened?
Sakru, it's pack up for us.
Aunty..spoke.
Aunty..go on.
Go up, quickly.
Papa, you go next. - Okay.
Thank you. Yes.
Son, come up.
You go first. - No, you go.
I said you go.
Are you two crazy,
you're discussing over this.
It's so windy up here, hurry up.
Hold on, let's do one thing.
Let's climb up together.
Because we've done
everything together.
Let's go. - Come on.
Kanhaiya, careful.
Careful.
Come on, Kanhaiya.
If you ever show me a sign again..
- Look, another sign.
Come on, son..take a selfie.
You're always joking around.
Come on, guys.
- Come on, take it up. Take it up.
We're safe.
Slowly, don't fall me down.
Yet I have to see my sons wedding.
Bless you. Here too.
God bless you.
Bless you. Bless you.
What are you doing?
Friends, please forgive me.
You all made me realise..
...that my thinking was so wrong.
You all took off your clothes..
But only so that
you can cover your body.
And anything we do
to make our ends meet.
...can never be a sin.
By saving us from that quick sand,
you all proved..
...that culture doesn't
come from covering yourself“
...or taking your clothes off.
And that's the naked truth.
Absolutely right, father.
That's been my thinking all along.
If you respect a girl..
“Only then will
she give you in return.
What?
What's he saying? - No, no.
He means to say "She'll
respect you back".
Yeah. - Correct.
And now we've decided
to make only family films.
Really.
Movies that families
can sit together and watch.
Kanhaiya, your eyes are normal
even after seeing red? - Yes.
How did this miracle happen?
That's because with great difficulty..
...I finally found true love, Rocky.
Yes! Yes!
This is called Happy Ending!
Happy ending.
We're experts in happy ending.
Hold on. It's not that
kind of happy ending.
This Happy Ending-
Happy Ending!
"How cool are we."
"How cool are we."
"How.."
