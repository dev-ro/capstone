But yöu were going to Phuket
for yöur friend's wedding, right?
Yes, l was going to.
What do yöu mean, "l was going to?"
lf yöu didn't go there then
how did yöu ran away from it?
By ran away l mean l got rid
of it with great difficulty.
Why would l unnecessarily
waste my time in Phuket?
That's right. Why
waste time in Phuket?
lf l would attend my
friend's wedding..
.. then how would l make
arrangements for my wedding?
And l have to fulfil the
responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry yöu.
She is wishful-serpent.
l will never let her wish come true.

Bad mummy, Mother Earth.

He was trying to make me

But why was he
trying to make yöu fall?
Anger. l said a few true
things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on
his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building
his body in the spare time.
Why are yöu ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying
something or the other..
.. don't yöu have to say something?
God sent him here to
increase the burden on earth.
yöu are telling the
truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
.. only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
<font color="#808080">-</font> He is a big disgrace.

Hey, listen. Hello.

yöu should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
yöu sing so well. yöu cook so well.
What would have happened if
yöu had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the
parcel to me without yöur signature.
yöu only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to
airport alone? yöu go with her, Prem.
Am l her driver,
chauffer or servant?
Brother.

Daddy, yöu are very that.

Oh, fax.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
He has sent a fax, yöu dirty mind.
Why are yöu fasting

The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave. Go.
Please go, son.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful. l think
he's up to something.

Only if he will let yöu call.
'l could've easily spent
10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't
have been born here.'
'She has made my family
crazy about her in two days.'
'l would be dead if she
would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those
we would gain something from.'
'l am just trying
to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and
he is taking a right turn.'
'ls he planning to take
me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam. lf l

'..then l'll get
stuck with yöu forever.'
'Then l will have to marry yöu.'
'Then why is he
taking me to a jungle?'
'Will he leave me
amidst wild animals?'
'l would have if l wasn't so
concerned about the poor animals.'
'l think l'll have to
show her a few lions.'
How can yöu even
think of such a thing?
What are yöu doing?
Where are the keys?
<font color="#808080">-</font> l threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did yöu throw it?
Are yöu a woman or what?
l'm a woman.
<font color="#808080">-</font> lf yöu are a woman..
..then yöu should have kept
the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with yöur 26" waist.
l can see a six and a
half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
yöur mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, they didn't.
Prem.

Take my hand.
Give me yöur hand. Give me
yöur hand. Give me yöur hand.
Come closer first.
No, l am thinking that it's better..
..if one person
dies rather than two.
Coward. Dastard. Pansy. Chicken.
Should l come there to help
yöu so that yöu can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Help me, God.
Give me yöur leg.
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu are already hanging.
How else should l hang yöu?
l mean give me yöur leg.
Leg? Man and woman
look good in pair.
But to touch something
with ones' leg is a grave sin.
yöu are hanging on the
branch with both yöur hands.
How will yöu save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has
2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, l can
save yöu with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no. Not the waist.
Then yöu will say
that l took advantage.
What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> By the way yöur waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever yöu want.
Do whatever yöu want.
But please save me.
ln that case, come

of my disadvantage.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
lf yöu come any closer,
then l swear..
..l'll let go of both
the hands and embrace yöu.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me. Let's go.
What are yöu doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
yöu women are amazing.
yöu cannot stick on to
anything other than yöur age.
Sometimes yöu say
take the advantage..
..sometimes yöu say don't take
advantage. What nonsense is this?
All yöur yakking is
making me go crazy.
lt was the demand of the situation.
l wasn't wrong to touch yöu now.
l was wrong to touch yöu earlier.
lf this is not wrong
then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong
then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, yöu are wrong.
lt is wrong to sit
here and talk to yöu.
lt's of no use. l'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use. l'm
sitting and yöu are lying down.
lt would've benefited if either ..
.. both of us were
sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double
meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like
this. l feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on yöur waist.
My ill-fate l wish he wasn't a man.
And yöu weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem. Prem. Prem.'
lsn't it a great place?
yöu call out once and it
echoes back a number of times.
yöu have brought me
here to hear this?
Oh, no. This is nothing.
Now l'll shout yöur name and
see what name echoes back.
Should l?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana.'
l'm saying Pooja and it is
echoing back as Sanjana.
lsn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Only echoes come
back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth. Who are yöu?
Otherwise, l'll let go of yöu.

Sanjana Singh.
Actually, l had come
from America to get married.
But the guy l was
going to get married to..
..turned out to be
a famous don's son.
l ran away from the wedding
but they snatched my passport.
lt takes at least 10-12
days to make a new passport.
l needed a place to hide as well.
Then l saw yöu at the airport.
yöu had come to pick up
Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So l thought..

<font color="#808080">-</font> l know the rest.
What did yöu do with the real Pooja?

So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.

Hello. l'm not here

And l've only seen him
from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.

Will yöu be able to recognize him?

My mother was a woman.
And the person who
murdered my father..

'A decent dog?'
'Have they lost their mind?'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?

starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites,
scratches or does anything else..

Where is everybody gone?
Brother.. Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are yöu running?
Come on, come on.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called.. As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding
date for yöur marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
yöu go ahead. We'll come.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.
Pooja, it is
believed that all wishes..
..come true if one
bathes in this sacred pond.
Come.
Which Pooja are yöu
talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned
from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one
who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja
since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel
yöu ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
yöu want me, right?
l'm ready to come with yöu.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
l knew that yöu would surely come.
And l, too, knew
that yöu would say..
.."l knew that yöu
would surely come."
Why should l come,
huh? Am l yöur boyfriend?
l love yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Saw? yöu are agreeing to it.
No. Really? He's yöur uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would l tell yöu that..
..these goons, mafias
are my maternal uncles?
Great.
yöur family members are like
Charles Shobraj and Ranja Billa?
l love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
yöu don't know how much
my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that l get both my
uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human
beings like they were, earlier.
But?
<font color="#808080">-</font> The greed of attaining
my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me
to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
l can draw a cheque
without deducting the TDS..
..and keep yöur uncles
in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are
obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we
tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets
scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets
scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
<font color="#808080">-</font> And a man is
scared of a woman.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go. My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't worry, dear.
Today, l'll predict yöur future.
yöu will get married to
an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can l take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of
the lndian dress is very good.
"Ready.. l am ready for yöu.
Are yöu ready for me?"
"Are yöu ready for me?
Are yöu ready for me?"
"Are yöu ready for me?
l am ready for yöu."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
l ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
What should l do about this boy?
This boy is making me that. That..
lrritate?
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, not irritate.
That.. This.. This..
Emotional?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Emotional is like this. This..

He is making crazy. Crazy. Crazy.
He lied to me. That
girl is not this but that.
What..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja. Yes. Yes.
What yöu are thinking
of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
They are dons.
l would've said the same
had l been in yöur place.
But.. what would've yöu
done had yöu been in my place?
Why don't yöu make him understand?
What should l tell him?
All l know is that
Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she
must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no
solution to this problem.
l have such a solution that l'll make
the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA,
who has done BA.
And his name.. What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
<font color="#808080">-</font> ldli (a south lndian snack)?
Mulli (Raddish)?

Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many
times will yöu call me?
l feel that yöu call me even
when yöu dial a wrong number.
What do l do?
yöu have left the
house with so much cash.
l'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time
l'm out with so much cash.
l do transactions worth millions,
day and night.
All 500 and 1000
denomination bills..
..across the world

Then?
<font color="#808080">-</font> That's fine.
But what if a thief
stabs yöu and robs yöu?
Sakku, are yöu concerned about me..

Hang up, Sakku.

One of 30 lakhs and
the other of 20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag! Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag? There

Where did the bag go?
My bag. My bag got stolen.
Have yöu seen a thief here?
<font color="#808080">-</font> No.
yöu blind man, yöu

yöu didn't even see such a big bag?
l didn't see it. l'm
not the owner of it.
yöu.. Have yöu seen yöur face?
lt's so black that if
shown on National Television..
..it will ward off evil
from the entire country.
Sakku, what yöu
said came true. Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj
Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.

They are here. Tell

A trunk ran over him.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do yöu have anyone to look
after yöu in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, l had
brought this bag for him.
What will l do of this
briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry. l'll take
care of both his belongings.
Okay? Let's meet
after his final rites.
Thank yöu.
Bring it here.
Where are yöu going?
yöu are alive, sir?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, l'm alive.

People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50
lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes. Yes. Yes. There
are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did yöu come to know
that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the
bundle of the notes..
..l can predict how
many notes it contains.
How?
<font color="#808080">-</font> l learnt this art
from my master. Mr. B. B., sir.

Such a fat book?
yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Look at this. The Balidaan
in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
yöu wrote a book and
yöu don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a
missile and yöu are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
l have come to this city
to be yöur assistant, sir.

Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
lf they get together

But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during
a year do yöu think..
..people like Chaudhary
must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be
paying the taxi fare. Sir..
l make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.

12 times.

Yes.
What do l do? lt is

This is the only way to

Sir, yöur name is Balidaan but yöu
are making yöur clients sacrifice.
Now that yöu have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..

Come with us. Come with us.

Hit him.
Stop. Stop. Don't hit me.
Stop. Stop. l am yöur teacher,
Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher? yöu are a cheater,

yöu gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of lndia?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mrs. Prathiba Patil.
yöu had said that
it was Abdul Kallam.
The president got changed.

Do l have to go there
and dig their graves?
Hit him. Hit him. Hit him.
Well done. yöu are

Saw that? That's why

Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!

Mother, yöu go inside.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Stop barking, yöu dog.

Forget about the wace,
Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.

He will show yöur income so less..
..that yöu won't need to pay tax.

Anyway, yöur ponytail
looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at yöur grandpa.
lt suits him so well.
Take this. Stupid. Go to school.
Yes, grandpa. This is the first time
mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With yöur permission
can l chop it off?
Amar Chaudhary, yöu can have yöur
neck cut but not yöur ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais. This is
the identity of our family.
yöur l.D. proof.
lt is a voter's card,
pan card. yöur blood group.
A proof that yöu are his
grandson and he is yöur grandpa.
Where did this
boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
l saw yöu.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on yöur studies.
Kids of yöur age have gone places.
People of yöur age as well..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now l'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are yöu doing?
l'm having black coffee
with Obama in the White House.
Can't yöu see?
l hit the brakes to give yöu a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened
because of me, right?
l'm feeling very guilty.
l love yöu too.
Now it is my duty to
get yöu out of here.
l also want to leave.
Because if my children grow
up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave
that the poor thing..
..might once again
run away with someone.
No such thing will happen
because l have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with
whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like
he is from our city.
l'll find him even if he
is hiding underground.
Are yöu telling the truth?
Sir, if l am lying he
should die immediately.
No, l take his oath
and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was
not him but someone else.
Sir.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet yöu.
Balli, yöu got the land cleared
for Amar for his liquor factory?
l just got the land
cleared for him.
But for yöu along with

..the license for the
liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go. yöu are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, l am
leaving but before leaving..
..l would like to
give yöu a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only l know how he traps people.
yöu won't be able
to anything to him..
..even if he comes
and stands before yöu.
yöu do one thing.
yöu keep cleaning cars
here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are yöu saying?
Sir, this is a crime. lt's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, yöu cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con. C- O- N. Con.
He joined hands with
that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have l left out?
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary,
isn't the boy useful?
Once l start working, there
will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work
for Amar as well as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
yöu know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his
yöunger brother B.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then yöu can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Saw? He agrees to it.

Hey..

Let them work.
Saw that? My future

So, yöur sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
<font color="#808080">-</font> He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..

<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
But l want to
marry yöur son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Please,
uncle. Please, do something.
Please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load yöur guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana
at any cost by this evening.
What are yöu doing, Chaudhary..
Sir. Uncle, tell them.
What yöu are doing is wrong.
yöu are going to kill
yöur brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500
crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are yöu talking about?
Uncle, l'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes. K.K. Modi from America.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this. yöu
know who has been given..
..the responsibility of
getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, yöu couldn't
see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina
desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic. They are
going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if l wouldn't
have thought of this..
..then there would've
been a bloodshed today.
Why don't yöu think?
No, the idea was on
the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
lf we don't get this alliance
then consider yöurself death.
Get out of here.
l took K.K. Modi's
name just like that.
yöu added his daughter
to the story.
yöu added the
responsibility of her marriage.
yöu added all the spices.
Sir, yöu told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
l told yöu about
people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called
five times since morning.
He told me to remind
yöu that he is coming..
..to lndia on Friday to
discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked
to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means yöu
either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.
Sir, in this illness the
battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, sir.
ln this the characters yöu
think about come in real life.
l don't believe this.
That's why it is
called unbelievable power.
Now yöu have to decide whether..
..it's yöur effective
thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, yöu have
thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, Prem.
l said that as l
was worried. Please.
Okay.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what l should do next.
There is no option
or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is
that yöu book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu. Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here. Come here.
Give yöur friend a hug.
yöu have become fit.
l think it is the result of
sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.
Love.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
l hope yöu didn't have any
that on the way. What is it..
No, no. One has to take some
that for one's child. Some..
Trouble.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mr. Modi.
Stop. ls this a way
to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
A very famous L in the city.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Landlord? <font color="#808080">-</font> Landlord. <font color="#808080">-</font> Landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome,
welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, Balli knows yöu.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Guest. Guest.
Call him tonight for..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Drinks?
Dinner. Dinner. And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are yöu staring at
them with yöur mouth open?
Have yöu seen them
for the first time?
Anyone will give that
reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if yöu are a
mouse then he is a cat.
lf yöu are a cat, he is a dog.
lf yöu are a dog, he is a fox.
lf yöu are a fox then he is a lion.
lf yöu are lion then
he is an elephant.
lf yöu are an elephant
then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For yöur own good,
come on time for dinner.
Otherwise yöu are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
l am here till night.
Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But l couldn't recognize him.
ls it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Both?
One personality is ill.
lt is the imagination of
the other personality.
The first and the
second personality clashed..
..with each other and
resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality
will be suicidal personality.
yöu will feel like
committing suicide, uncle.
yöu are right.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No.
l feel like committing suicide.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No.
Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't do it, uncle.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Why?
yöu won't remember that yöu
have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should l do?
Uncle, now yöu have
only one option left.
What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Believe that yöur personality
with imagination is right.
yöu know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu recognize him.
l'll have to.
Otherwise, l'll commit suicide..
..and l won't even
remember it. So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not
as rich as yöu are.
But we are well
respected in the city.
Great.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, sir. They are decent people.
Really?
 <font color="#808080">-</font> They have a lot of
cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how
much loan do yöu want?
No, sister-in-law, l am..
Balli, tell them.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What should l say?
Uncle, with yöur permission
can l tell them?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the
8th grade. The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till
the 8th grade. So?
He wants to marry yöur daughter.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
Brother Ballu, yöu have
brought such an alliance?
Have yöu seen their faces?
They look as if they have
just come out of a jungle.
Right. Will their daughter
marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any
sense of that. Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Talk.
To talk. They look like that. That..
Ape-men.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Ape-men.
lf yöu weren't my friend
l would have done that.
Shot.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Shot yöu.
Let's go..

<font color="#808080">-</font> Sumitra.
Let's go.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.
yöu ruined their mood.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Shut up. Shut up.
yöu..
l'll blow yöur head
with yöu, yöu scoundrel.
yöu fool, he isn't a scoundrel,
yöu are.
Do yöu know who
are yöu messing with?
yöu can only make
scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn
scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
yöu have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay. Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will l think of?
l am totally confused.
Will yöu tell us
what this is all about?
Why have yöu made us
all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these
Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three
conditions for the wedding.
l told them that l won't be
able to look into yöur eyes..
..after telling
yöu those conditions.
And yöu won't be able to look at
each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them
wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
Tell us. Tell us, what
their conditions are.
Basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's
lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way yöu dress.
What are yöu doing?
They say that yöu look like
a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This.. This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes. Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for
their 500 crores.
 <font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
500..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Crores.
Okay. Okay. We will
wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes. Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like
in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the
movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen yöu
out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with yöur daughters and
daughters-in-law.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has
been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
That the Chaudharys will never change
their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> 500 crores.
Fine. Fine. Listen. Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
lf l tell yöu the third condition
then.. yöur pants will tear.
Pants?
<font color="#808080">-</font> l am saying this.
l am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
yöu'll have to cut it.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
yöu'll have to cut yöur ponytail.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes. Yes.
But what can we do? They hold
the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
yöu can always grow them back.
But yöu don't often get a
harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now yöu are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have yöu decided?
What have l.. What
do yöu say, Ballu?
Should l do that? Yes?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Do it.
Now that yöu have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Fine, then l'll call my
daughter and yöunger that tomorrow.
Brother.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Brother.
Okay.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Do yöu have relatives or
brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Suraj Chaudhary.
ln spite of having
an elder brother..
..yöu have come alone
to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Get along.
Get long. Will their
daughter go there?
<font color="#808080">-</font> The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that
their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out
and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers
love each other a lot.
Like.. Lord Rama and Laxman.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay. Okay. Okay.
So call them tonight. Match the..
Timings.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Timing. Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Condition.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Hit him. Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Sister-in-law, please, help.
That l have an elder brother?
l said it because yöu have one.
yöu could have said
that he is dead.
yöu are strange.
How could say that?
Till date yöu haven't
been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will yöu kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will
never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a
head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think. He
will think of something.
He will bring yöur
brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead
me even if l talk about it.
And if he doesn't come
here then l'll behead yöu.
What?
Hey, let us go in. Move aside.
Side. Side. Side.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Who are yöu?
Keep distance. Horn please.
May the face of the one with
ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are yöu? ln this manner..
This is how we enter.
yöu have all the
right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
l pay income tax
thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear. How are yöu?
Sanjana, yöu know
these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from
the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
l have heard of Punjab
Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a World Bank?
The one outside Punjab and
Allahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are yöu doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a
loan of 200 crores from our bank.
So?
<font color="#808080">-</font> So he passed away
before he could settle the loan.
So?
<font color="#808080">-</font> He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind
when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all
his property in America.
We have managed to
get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't
hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic. After marriage a wife
has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we
will recover 100 crores from yöu.
The bungalow itself must
be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go. Let's go.
Mr. Lover, l knew that yöu
would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this
issue of 100 crores?
Should l tell yöu
everything today itself?
What's the rush?
Where are yöu going?
yöu are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this
house and other things..
..yöu will manage to
arrange 100 crores, right?
yöu, too, wouldn't
want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the
value of the property.
Okay.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Again? No.
Actually l have some work
with him. Not now. Okay?
Fine. We will begin
once yöur work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will yöu do?
yöu will get tired.
yöu..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Everyone is standing here.
lt's written in the scriptures,
uncle..
..the more yöu
work the better it is.
This girl will put
me on streets to beg.
Now l got it.
Why did he break the
alliance with this girl..
..and formed an
alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl
has a loan over her head.
Balli.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
lnstead of us, yöu got K.K.
Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into
Amar's family.
lf he has ruined it,
he will mend it.
How?
<font color="#808080">-</font> How?
yöu know B.K. Modi.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Who is B.K. Modi?
yöu only had said that K.K.
Modi has a yöunger brother.
Yes. Yes. He does. He does.
K.K. Modi has a yöunger brother.
But what about him?
<font color="#808080">-</font> His money.
What about his money?
yöu only had said..
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother
when it comes to money.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
Yes. Yes. l said so.
But what about him?
<font color="#808080">-</font> His daughter.
Daughter.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
yöu had taken the responsibility
of getting her married.
Wow, Balli. No matter what yöu
say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am. Coming.
l'll go and check the property.
l'll see how much worth it is.
Darling Balli, what
conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"lf they get it right
they will make it big."
"Money can make yöu do anything."
Amar!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Brother!
Brother!
Where is yöur party?
Has gone to pickup
yöur party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did yöu call her?
lt feels very nice to see the
two of yöu together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of yöu
decide who l should marry.
Dear, yöu should forget Veer.
Last night yöur mother
visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't
good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over. l
will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
yöur mother visited me
in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother,
don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will l stay single all my life?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Not at all, dear.
We, yöur uncles are there for yöu.
We will find someone
good enough for yöu.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a
grand wedding for yöu.
Why do yöu worry, dear?
We are there for yöu.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever yöu feel is right.
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
Meet him. He's my yöunger brother..
B.K..
<font color="#808080">-</font> B.K. Modi.
Yes. Modi.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are yöu, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu look fit.
l think sister-in-law's
love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine. She
keeps talking about all of yöu.
How is B.K? What is he doing
these days?
<font color="#808080">-</font> That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls
didn't come with yöu?
To hell with the girls.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
He means say hello
to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple
of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are yöu thinking about,
uncle? What are yöu thinking about?
l couldn't recognize
the other Modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not
an illness but an imagination.
yöu mean the character l
think about, comes to life?
Yes. yöu have the power. Otherwise,
how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a
person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
yöu mean l am.. God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God. ldiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma,
but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son.. Tell me, who was he?
Speak up. Tell me. Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he
pointing towards yöu?
Balli. This means yöu..
No, sir. l cannot even
put a comma to sentence.
How can l put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, yöur son
is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is
moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is
pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, yöur
son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even
point his finger towards yöu.
Oh, my. The son is
pointing towards his father.
Please go out. The
patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he
will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in
this world. yöur sorrow is so less.
yöu aren't able to say anything..
..because of yöur unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything
even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir. No, sir. Madam..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Move back. l don't care.
Please sir. Sir, please.
<font color="#808080">-</font> lt's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his
breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, l've been
looking for yöu all over the city.
And yöu are having fun over here.
yöu are having parties.
l'm being pressurized by the bank.
l keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what yöu want to do.
Mr. Modi, yöu are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like
yöu have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that
with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married
with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
yöur brother-in-law Veer was
going to marry yöur niece, right?
No.
Niece? Who is his niece?
Here she is. Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do yöu want to get
related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was..
<font color="#808080">-</font> For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like
Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary
cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Good.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Good. A very good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a yöung
unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their
brothers-in-law married.
lt is wrong, isn't it?
<font color="#808080">-</font> True.
lt is not so. Mr. Chaudhary is
looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as
soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take yöur time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get
married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
<font color="#808080">-</font> No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Condition.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Our condition.
Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Another condition?
Don't worry. All the four
Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something
in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether yöu are a
crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what yöu are.."
"..l swear on God, yöu are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys
might get a heart attack..
..listening to yöur conditions.
Brother has kept a condition
of Sanjana's wedding.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
But yöu'll have to give the idea
that our Prem will be her groom.
This condition has been
kept to give this idea.
Okay.
<font color="#808080">-</font> But they are
very dangerous people.
lf they find out the truth..
There is one person who
is very dangerous. Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already
said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth,
he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his
family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
The poor thing is
standing as a statue.
Fine, l will bring it into life.
Brother. Brother. Brother.
l have come here to
tell yöu a secret.
Here he is. Here he is.
yöu are doing pushups?
No, l'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.
Tell me, who am l?
Am l God? Am l a
human being? Who am l?
yöu are the first God with has
been made by this human being.
What not have yöu made me?
Now even l have forgotten
who l am.
l have become the Aamir
Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.
Look here. Look at this.
yöu have no idea how difficult
it is to write on yöur back!
Rascal.
yöu played such a big
game with a genius like me..
..who has written
such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here yöu go, genius.
l won't let yöu win
as long as l am alive.
What will l do?
Mr. Balli, Mr.
Chaudhary is calling yöu.
Go. yöu have been summoned.
Yes. Yes, l've put
the ball in the hole.
l've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to
play marbles as well.
yöu are right.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Greetings, sir.
Come. Come, Mr. Balidaan. Come.
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this
acquaintance into a relationship?
l didn't get yöu.
yöur nephew Prem and
our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No.
No, this marriage cannot
take place.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Why not?
yöu are a servant.
We are yöur employer.
yöu don't like the
respect we are giving yöu?
Why cannot this
marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back
in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't touch me.
yöu see, the girl has a loan
of 100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back? yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> We will pay it back.
We are going to get
millions from the Modis.
yöu can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if yöu
sent yöur daughter..
..without any clothes on,
we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle? We
accept it, don't we?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
l accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, yöur teeth will break
if yöu will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps
saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a
boy during her wedding.
lf someone comes to know
about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can yöu please take
care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Who eloped with Sanjana?
This..
What is this that yöu are asking
me? l had shown yöu the photograph.
A lie.
yöu are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
yöu are right. He
had eloped with her.
Forgive me, l had lied.
He is the one l had
given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what
yöu should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are yöu happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, yöu don't
know what a big favour..
..yöu have done to my
uncle and the Chaudhary family.
God will surely send
yöu to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
yöu became their that.
What is it? Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, yöu are the
one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could
we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did yöu unnecessarily
take the that. Trouble.
yöu go and have yöur meal.
<font color="#808080">-</font> We'll all have together.
No, we don't know
how long we will take.
Why should yöu stay that
because of us? Hungry.
Go, have yöur meal.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.
l love yöu.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At yöur place the women
eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat,
the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a
very that world. Small.
lt begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them. What
is it said? Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty
to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing. yöu have yöur meal.
Before yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> So what?
lf l drink all night along ill
yöu stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with yöu, today?
Love.
l love yöu.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, Shalani.
Now l will always call yöu Shalu.
And henceforth, yöu
can eat before me.
Why so?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Because l love yöu.
Thank yöu.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be
busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Come, let's go and
have some food. Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana
are also back. Come on.
The bride and the
groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
l have decided that this
marriage won't take place.
What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
Once again uncle must have
gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a
little too much to drink.
Balli, what are yöu saying?
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.
yöu are saying Balli
and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
lf uncle doesn't want this
marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, l don't
want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did yöu
become an orphan, yöu liar?
Here he is. yöur father is
here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine. Fine. Fine, Ballu.
lf yöu are breaking
yöur that with him.
Then l will form a
that with him. What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, l am yöur father.
And l am yöur mother.
l'm yöur uncle.
l'm yöur aunt.
lf yöu are falling short of relatives
then l, too, shall become one?
Why.. Why would yöu become anyone?
yöu are his uncle. Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Henceforth, l am his uncle.
<font color="#808080">-</font> And l am his aunt.
Look at that. They all
are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't yöu see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this. Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle. l'll
make him understand.
Uncle, yöu saw how
many relatives l have now?
lt won't make a difference
if l have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand yöur final
rites will be performed..
..and on the other
my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
<font color="#808080">-</font> But this
wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so l will prepare
for the wedding.

By the way, Prem..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes?
Have yöu come here
to show the necklace..
..yöur family has bought
for her or to see Sanjana?
l had come to
congratulate all of yöu.
This is the first love marriage
taking place in yöur family.
Aryan.
yöu came from the
hospital on the right day.
Come, l'll introduce yöu
to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't yöu want to get ready?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Ready?
Come on, go. Go.
<font color="#808080">-</font> l am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who
hit me with his car.
l went into coma because of him.
He was the one who
eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a
part of Prem's conspiracy.
l'll take care of yöu later,
yöu wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of yöu.
yöu are flying too high.
Do yöu love to fly?
Yes, we do.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What will yöu do?
Nothing, boys. l'll just
help yöu fulfil yöur dream.
yöu..
Where shall l keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law
about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity,
but a false one.
Never underestimate
three things in life.
l, me and myself.
Thank yöu.
No one can deport the one
who has the family's support.
l am someone who can drown a fish.
What can yöu three.. do to me?
Go, Veer. Go, Yuvraj.
l'll see how he stops yöu.
Let's go.
yöu are sleeping even
after coming out of coma?
Do yöu remember yöur name?
Aryan.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what l had done to yöu.
Where did he go?
<font color="#808080">-</font> He left right in front of yöu.
Mr. Modi.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Mr. Modi.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What happened?
We know the truth
about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
<font color="#808080">-</font> He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle. A Kapoor.
Uncle.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Uncle, catch them.
We'll see yöu.

Save us. Save us.

Come here.. Come here..
That way. That way.
Side effects of too much rajma
chawal (a rice dish). Sorry.
O God!
Card. Card.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Thank yöu.
Call me.
No pee me. Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him. Stop him.
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go fast.
yöu are a dead man.
We won't spare yöu.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of
our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother. Our
Sanjana looks so happy.
l'm ready to go to the
moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her l
feel that l won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
yöu know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date l've never
got that of that custom. A need.
yöu, too?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people,
someone stop them.
Aryan, yöu are back
from the hospital.
But who did this to yöu?
That beguiler, Prem.
We have been cheated
in such a big way.
Why did yöu do this to us? Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was
Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that yöu
two get Sanjana married..
..and give her yöur blessings.
And she believed that..
..yöu two brothers will
unite because of this marriage.
That means yöu really
made a fool out of us.
yöu cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are yöur uncles.
Listen, yöu idiots.
That's what l've been
telling yöu since so long.
But yöu didn't listen to me.
yöu didn't listen to me as well.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Then tell them now.
No, yöu only tell them.
God sent yöu down here but He
forgot to give yöu any brains.
yöu didn't change even after
seeing the goodness in him?
But l have changed.
From now on l will be
a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries
to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here yöu go.
yöu will touch my nephew.
No, l am here to give
yöu a hand, sir.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.
Sir, being with them till
date l have only washed cars.
Being with yöu, l am sure l
will thrash a person or two.
Great. Great.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Come on,
let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and yöu are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, yöu
will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are yöu
waiting for? Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, yöu continue.
lt's inauspicious to stop
that in the middle. That..
The wedding vows.
<font color="#808080">-</font> The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the
rest of them will get thrashed.
Come. Can l hold it?
Shall l start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
l'll shut down yöur World Bank.
Fast. Fast.
l'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem.
Prem, yöu can get another wife..
..but yöu won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a
woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, yöu won't get a better
chance to remove yöur shirt.
Show yöur body.
<font color="#808080">-</font> l won't.
Why?
<font color="#808080">-</font> He has become fat. Fat.
What shall l say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, l am
here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we
don't even look into..
..the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them
is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax,
Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that? This is what
is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, yöu only know
the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
yöu didn't even bother about
my mother, yöu deceased sister.
How low will yöu stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making
sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's yöu guys..
..who since ages have been
making yöur wives sacrifice.
l'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of yöu my sons.
Shame on yöu.
Disgusting.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hey old man,
have yöu lost yöur mind.
Father. Get up, father.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Father..
Don't yöu dare! He is our father.
l will cut yöur hand
if yöu even touch him.
And l will break yöurjaw
if yöu misbehave with him.
He lied. He cheated everyone.
And yöu are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does
the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we
ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead
demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very
satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we
should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge
because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing
relations he changed us.
We brothers have
been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got
hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family
doesn't make yöu a dear one.
A member is a dear one
when yöu accept him.
Sir.
Sorry. Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never
act like goons again.
And we will never
be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is
yöur original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding
along with our girl, please.
Madam.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Chaudharys plus
Kapoors equals to Chapoors.
