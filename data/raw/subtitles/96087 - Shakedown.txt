- I'm lookin' for lightning.
- Got ups. Got downs.
Got smiles. Got frowns.
Got smoke. Got blow.
Take you anywhere you wanna go.
I only have big bills.
That's cool.
Got plenty of change.
Could you, uh, turn off that box?
I really hate rap music.
Sure, my man.
- Thank you, man.
Car 54,
1091 Central Park West and 63rd,
Car 54. K.
Cuff him! Cuff him!
Where the fuck are you goin'? I'm
gonna help that young man over there.
Fuck him! Take care of this one first!
This one's dead!
Would you get the fuckin' handcuffs off him?
Hey, fuck you, goddamn it!
Take it easy, man.
Get him to the hospital!
Police officer Patrick O'Leary
was shot late last night in Central Park.
The mayor and the police commissioner expressed their outrage
at a press conference at the widow's house in Queens.
O' Leary was the fourth police officer
slain in the line of...
Hi.
Baby, baby, baby.
Congratulations. Gail, you beamed me up...
you beamed me up in the middle of my ecstasy.
Do you think it's a little early in the morning for heavy metal?
Listen, Gail... Gail, honey.
Sweetie, I love ya, I'm gonna marry ya,
but you're making me feel very old.
This is not heavy metal.
This is Hendrix. Genius, maybe.
But this is definitely not heavy metal.
Okay.
Okay?
Why don't you open your present?
Present. Right. What's the occasion?
Huh! Congratulations? For what?
On your last week with Legal Aid.
Hey. Groovy. Beautiful.
Why don't you wear one of the new suits
Daddy's guy made for you?
Just try it.
I don't know, Gail. I don't think the Wall Street
garb'll swing with the Rikers Island crowd, you know?
They'll take me for a pimp.
What does that make me?
The best.
What are you drinking?
Orange julius, homemade. Want some?
No. No, thanks.
Oh, I've gotta run. I have to be at Bumble and
Bumble in 45 minutes, so try the new suit.
Yeah.
Remember to call about the apartment.
You bet.
And, Roland,
about that tie...
- Yeah? What about it?
I like this tie.
So, Dalton, you're finally gonna
bag it at Legal Aid, huh, pal?
Yep, yep, yep, yep. What about the fight for the
underprivileged, the homeless and destitute?
You know what I'm talkin' about.
The good fight, pal. Pap and drivel, bud.
Just liberal pap for the multitudes.
Right.
Okay. Let's do it.
Okay.
These I gotta prosecute.
These I'm willing to let cop a plea.
You take the whole package, I let these
go for time served. It's beautiful.
Yeah, man. All right.
- Groovy
- This is not a going away party, Dalton.
- I can't live with that.
- Come on, home.
It's my last week in the jungle,
then I'm finito.
- Buy the next six lunches too?
- No guts, no glory.
Oh, baby. Dalton, I never figured you
for this upwardly mobile bullshit, man.
- It is a sellout.
- Hey, blood, the substance of law in America lies...
in keeping the money in this country out
of the hands of the widows and orphans...
and in the hands
of the major insurance companies,
who know best...
Who know best how to manage it.
Hey Susan.
Hi, Sean.
Hi.
Hi.
From the looks of you,
I'd say you found your insurance company.
Yeah, uh, Wall Street.
Next week.
You don't exactly look like
chopped liver yourself. Thanks.
Well, once again, I see that justice
is being served... for lunch.
Here. You forgot this one.
- just your average, crack-deaiin' cop killer. It's no big deal.
- But I haven't interviewed him yet.
Could be innocent.
Not bloody likely.
Still, I'm impressed you still care
about minor details such as that.
I'll meet you over at the pier.
You got it.
I'll see you in court.
Little history there, pal?
Yeah. The whole world, man.
What she mean, “See you in court“?
Probably talkin' about that cop killer
you got in your hand, pal.
What are you sayin'? She's a public
defender in Brooklyn. No, she's not.
No?
- She's the new assistant D.A.
- Come on. Is that straight?
Tag 'em and bag 'em, man.
You're dead.
Alma, what's the haps, babe?
Okay wise guy. Through the detector.
Alma, why do you torture me
with this...
Empty your pockets.
It's the watch. It's the watch.
It's always the watch, watch.
See?
You love me. You know it.
Statutory rape. Possession of a deadly weapon.
Possession and sale of cocaine.
Possession and sale of crack.
Possession and sale of crack, crack, crack.
This I've gotta hear.
Hey, Boesky!
My name isn't Boesky.
You want a condom with your lunch?
- A condom?
- Yeah.
The mayor says we gotta
offer every convict a condom a day...
along with counseling on safe sex.
I don't want a condom.
I want a condom.
- Thank you very much.
- Michael Jones, Roland Dalton.
I'm a lawyer from Legal Aid.
I've been appointed to represent you.
You've been charged with first-degree murder
of an undercover narcotics police officer.
You know, you don't look too bad for a guy who's
been shot. Shit. That guy used a .38, man.
A .38 couldn't kill a cockroach. That's why I use a
nine-mil. Hit somebody with a nine, they don't get up.
Oh, yeah? You used a nine-mil on this cop?
Yeah.
What's the pitch, Michael? Are you
not gonna tell me you didn't do it?
Of course I did it.
I'm in the park sellin' drugs.
White dude come up to me,
pull out a gun, say, “Give me your money.“
- So I shot him. Self-defense.
- Michael, you want a lawyer or you want your mother?
'Cause she's the only fool
that's gonna buy that bag of shit.
Hey, man, I done a lot of bad things,
but I'm not stupid.
- I don't lie to my lawyer.
- Here we go.
- That dude was a blue jean cop, man.
- Blue jean cop?
Yeah. Blue jean cop. What are you sayin'?
You shot him 'cause you didn't like his pants?
Dude didn't even show me no badge, man. I didn't
know he was a cop till they booked my ass.
I thought he was a vigilante.
Had to defend myself.
Well, that little mistake
may very well get your ass cooked.
Shit, man. I work for somebody
who pays his bills. Crack. You dig?
- I dig.
- This cop must've been trying to cut hisself a piece of my man's action.
Shit. All he had to do was say so. I'd have handed
him my green, let him and my man work it out.
I don't steal no dust
between N.C. and the pigs.
Who's N.C.?
Ohh, man, I didn't say that.
Mornin', Richie.
Mornin', Billy.
Hup. Hey, babe,
I'm white and can't fight.
Well, comin' up in the world, huh?
What's, uh... What's the
mortgage on this condo?
What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doin' here, man?
I'm brushin' my fuckin' teeth.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
How did you find me?
Your old lady.
She told me to tell you if you don't get
your ass home and do the right thing,
she's gonna pack up all your shit and ship it
back to Rope and Ride or Bump and Grind...
or whatever the hell the name it is of
that hick town in Texas you come from.
- What else did she say?
- She said pick up the laundry.
Right. See what you got
to look forward to, Counselor?
Hows your fiancée?
Ehh, she doesn't like Jimi Hendrix.
- Who?
- Come on. Let's get some chow. My treat.
- Do I smell another shakedown?
- That's verdad gringo.
Nice tie.
I knew there was a reason I liked you.
Look at this, Marks.
I don't believe all this glass, man.
What is this shit?
Empty crack containers, Counselor.
Popcorn.
If you wanna know what the latest drug craze is,
check out Uncle Billy's trash can.
Junkies come and go, but Billy's trash can is
always there. Right now it's full of that shit.
Speaking of that shit, tell me something.
What's a blue jean cop?
Where'd you hear that?
From a client.
Well, I'm strictly bargain basement:
Wranglers and Levi's.
You lost me. Guys I bust, on the other hand,
wear Sergio Valentes.
Richie, you wanna run this
by me in English? All right.
Take some cop, some average guy who never
had a shot at a big bust in all his life.
Just goin' along, grindin' out
his 27,500 a year.
All of a sudden he ends up on a narc squad.
One mustard.
One afternoon he busts some scumbag
carrying a bagful of chemicals.
That bagful of chemicals is worth more
than that cop's gonna make in 10 years.
Next day he's out shoppin'
for designer jeans.
Lure of easy money.
Very hard to refuse.
What about this cop who got whacked in Central Park,
O'Leary? Was that the deal with him?
Why are you workin' up such a sweat about this?
Word is you're out of the game in another week.
Call me a creature of habit.
O'Leary.
What about him?
“What about him?“ Oh, great. Thanks.
Come on, Dalton. Even if I knew the
answer to that, I'm not gonna tell you.
Fuck, man. I gotta find out what's goin' down here.
So look around.
Oh. “Look around.“
Great. What? Look. Who? What?
I'm gonna tell you somethin', Dalton.
Cops don't know shit about hidin' money.
Check out his house.
His house? Okay.
It killed you to tell me that, didn't it?
The last of the big fuckin' spenders, man.
Great.
Double or nothin', Richie. Straight up.
How come no designer jeans for you?
I just figured they were meant
for girls with cute little asses...
and guys with no balls.
Besides, I'm independently wealthy.
Oh, right. I love what you did with the condo.
This ain't high school, Dalton. These guys got
guns and money and not a fuckin' thing to lose.
I appreciate the advice.
P.S. Who's N.C.?
You just don't fuckin' get it, do ya?
Just don't get it.
Don't fuck with these people.
Richie, I don't wanna fuck with 'em.
I just wanna dance.
Uh, Mrs. O'Leary, I'm involved with the people
prosecuting the man who killed your husband.
I know this may not be the most appropriate time,
but I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I may.
Come in.
I was just making some tea.
Would you like some?
Or something stronger?
I'll, uh, have whatever you're having.
Okay.
Where the hell is Marks?
Why isn't he with us?
He's downtown. He's picking up the warrants.
He's gonna take the subway up here and meet us.
It's cool. Don't worry. I would never
take a subway to this part of town.
What? What are you talkin' about?
He's a cop. He's got a gun.
Patrick O'Leary was a cop. He had a gun.
This place is worse than Beirut.
What do you want from me, huh? If you guys wouldn't
mind, could I get out of this car before we get there?
I mean, you're supposed to be undercover,
but even a blind man could tell you're cops.
If someone sees me with you, I'm dead meat.
Listen, Dipshit!
If somebody sees you with us, you are dead meat.
You know, they're gonna kill you, baby.
Cut your balls off, gouge your eyes out.
But it's gonna be over soon enough.
But if the information you've given
us turns out to be bullshit,
we're gonna put you in a cell with Big Leroy,
a 350-pound bull nigger faggot.
And when you got out in five years maybe,
you'll be able to look up your asshole and see the sky.
- Don't fuck with me.
- Stevie, Stevie.
Give me another cigarette, will ya?
Buy your own.
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- I really appreciate this.
You're quite...
quite welcome.
Where are your cans?
Are they in the garage?
Yeah. Um, no. Well, the garage is locked.
Just put it at the bottom of the stairs.
That's it.
This okay?
Yeah. Thank you.
Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you. Bye.
Bye.
Thanks.
Ladies, put your bags on the conveyor.
And, gentlemen, let's see your green.
Good.
Now, one at a time,
walk through the detector.
Welcome to Wonderland.
- Welcome.
- Whoa. Listen. You think that was real?
Did you hear those screams? You can't fake that.
I think they really cut them up.
Please.
You gotta let me have some more.
You've got to.
You know the rules.
No credit. Cash only.
But, uh, I don't have any more on me.
I'll pay you back. I promise.
Mr. Carr decides things like that.
But I wouldn't advise it.
Please?
Tell the man your story.
Uh...
I gave them all my money.
But I need more.
For most, there's no other way but pay.
But for you, maybe there's another.
Here's Marks. Let's go.
Dipshit, take off.
All right. You ready to rock 'n' roll?
Yeah. I'm ready.
Good. You got them fuckin' warrants?
Yeah.
Shit.
All right. Here's the deal.
These watches here are synchronized.
At exactly 11:11, you blow out the back,
we'll blow in the front.
You see anything you like?
Let's do it.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Everybody freeze!
Move all of them out!
Come on!
Let's go! Go! Go! Faster!
Okay. Okay.
Over to the bar. Go! Go!
Get on the fuckin' wall.
Get up!
Why don't you take Mr. Nicky
downtown?
We'll stay here, clean up,
book the evidence.
Give me the toy.
Let's see how you dance, scale.
Because of the quantity of drugs seized
and the defendant's prior record,
I'm going to set cash bail
at one million dollars.
Objection! Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
You're the prosecutor, and you're objecting
to one million dollars cash bail?
Yes, Your Honor.
It's not enough.
Miss Cantrell, it's 11:55 on a Friday night.
That's a lot of cash to come up with at this hour.
Nicky Carr can pull that amount
out of his small change purse.
It's not enough to ensure
that he'll appear for trial.
Objection overruled.
Mr. Rosen, do you have anything to say?
Yes, Your Honor.
My client will make bail.
Fuck.
- Evidence room.
- Hello. Larry?
This is Margaret O'Leary.
Someone broke into the garage last night.
I think they saw Patrick's car.
Uh, thanks.
I'll get back to you on that.
Larry, I'm worried. Can you talk now?
No.
I'll call you...
I'll call you later.
Just checkin' to see if the Nicky Carr
evidence got booked in all right.
Yeah. Yeah, it's there.
Good.
- A lot of cash, wasn't it?
- It was a lot of cash, but it wasn't "a lot" of cash.
Yeah.
Give me two of whatever he's having.
You want a quadruple boilermaker?
Yeah, and a Pepsi.
I hope you're not planning
on driving home.
I got no plans, Richie.
But speakin' of drivin',
there's a brand-new, bright red,
Porsche Cabriolet, turbo,
stuck under a tarp in the back
of O'Learys garage.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yep.
I don't know. I just don't know, Richie.
Once upon a time, all I planned to do
was play the tenor sax...
forever.
That's it.
Villes-ville, man.
But my dad, everybody, said I was a sap.
No money in it.
So I go to law school,
and I am here now.
Gone from that other place.
But I could play the tenor sax
all day and all night.
Everything was possible, and I was
very certain that at any minute...
I was going to meet
the love of my life.
The love of your life?
Yeah.
I met the love of my life,
only I killed her dog...
before I had a chance to tell her.
Man, she was everything I ever wanted.
We met at "Shakespeare in the Park."
I told her I was a lawyer.
That line seemed to work for you.
Rained like hell that day.
Had an umbrella.
We went back to her apartment.
She went to the bathroom.
I sat on the couch.
She had this great big damn dog.
The dog had a ball, so I threw it.
The dog brought it back.
I threw it again... harder.
I'll never forget the sound of that dog's paws
on the newly waxed floors.
How was I supposed to know
she left the window open?
That dog fell 13 stories,
landed on the top of a parked car.
I went over, leaned out the window,
looked down, threw up and left.
Left.
Without ever tellin' her
she was the one.
Happy is the fleeting hope of youth.
Who said that?
Me.
I'm gonna take this case, Richie.
Good for you, Counselor.
Me too.
Hi.
I'm lookin' for a runner.
About this high, white,
135 pounds, brown hair.
Wears a little ponytail.
He was wearing a pair of gray pants
and a flashy Kind of gray sweater...
and a pair of felony fliers
the night of the bust.
Hey, cop, what's your problem?
This place is legal now.
You lookin' for a cut, you gotta talk
to your boys down at the station.
Yeah. Get up.
- I said get up.
- Hey, cop, stop harassin' me before I call my lawyer.
You know what this is?
It's a gun. It's a gun.
You're a fuckin' genius.
Now, listen to this.
This gun is clean.
No serial numbers.
So after I blow out what's left of your brains and
chuck it in the East River, your case is closed.
People downtown are gonna file it under D.S.A.F.
“Did Society A Favor.”
You got it?
I understand. I understand.
Now, where is he?
Stevie's on the Deuce
over at the New Amsterdam.
Yeah? Yeah.
You said you wanted to go along for the ride.
- Yeah, man.
- The bus is leavin', amigo.
Okay. Where?
New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street. Thirty minutes.
I'm down.
Ira!
Hey. Nice to see ya.
Whoa. Wait a minute, Stevie.
Yeah. This one looks real.
You bet your ass it's real.
Hey, Bob, I want you to change the
sheets in the honeymoon suite.
This is what I got,
and this is what I want.
Stevie. Which room is he in?
You know how it is, Chief.
I don't think he wants to
be disturbed right now.
Honeymoon suite.
He's in the honeymoon suite.
Oh.
Huh.
Shit.
Real, live girls, gentlemen.
Real, live girls.
Look at Bobbie in booth three,
Melody in booth four...
and Tamara in booth five.
These are real, live women... live flesh.
Step into a booth.
Richie, Richie, look, I don't know what
kind of party we're crashin' up here,
but you don't happen to have a little
somethin' for me, do ya, like a bazooka?
You know how to use one of these?
Fuckin' a bubba.
I'm from New York City.
Don't shoot me in the ass.
Holy shit.
Oh, yeah.
Police officer. Freeze!
Hands up.
Get your goddamn hands up.
Anything you say, Officer.
Grab him!
You son of a bitch!
Hey!
You drive. I'll shoot.
Stay back, motherfucker!
That's my house, you son of a bitch!
Get off!
Where you goin', Max? Hey, Rydell.
Too bad about Dipshit, huh?
He gave us a lot of good tips.
Yeah, I'll bet he did.
What kind of shit you carryin'?
That ain't regulation.
It's the gun I own to exercise my
constitutional right to bear arms.
Hey, ain't you something?
Big John Wayne fan, huh?
.45 Magnum.
Plan on taking down an army?
I don't know yet.
Right.
Sweetheart, I'm going to bed.
Okay. Good night.
Did you call about the apartment?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I forgot. I forgot all about it.
I've had all this work to do.
My ass still aches from that motorcycle. I...
Roland, you promised. If we don't call,
we lose the apartment.
I know, Gail. I know.
I'll call about the apartment tomorrow.
I just can't believe you're spending all
this time trying to get this guy set free,
and you can't find five minutes to do
something that's really important for us.
This guy's a crack dealer. He's a rapist.
People like him belong in jail.
- I can't believe you want him out.
- I don't necessarily want him out.
- I just don't want him in for something he didn't do.
- Who cares if he did it?
If he didn't do this, he damn sure did something else.
Who gives a fuck if he's innocent?
- Well, I do. I give a fuck.
- For Christ's sake, this man sells death to schoolkids.
Gail. Hey, hey, sweetie.
What's goin' on here, huh?
Come here. Now,
what's all this about, huh?
Is this some kind of panic that I'm gonna take a
left turn on your dad's offer about his law firm?
I don't know. Maybe.
Yeah?
I just don't understand
your fascination with all this.
Hey, it's all in your mind.
I'll call about the apartment. I promise.
I'll call tomorrow. All right?
Okay.
And you love me, right?
I... I love you.
A lot.
A lot.
Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
one thing I promise not to do in
this courtroom, is to pretend to you...
that I am representing
Snow White for a client.
The simple fact of the matter is that all the
Seven Dwarfs couldn't match his record...
- on a weekend pass in Singapore.
I'm not going to conceal this fact from you,
and I apologize to my humble colleague,
the district attorney, for snatching
that ham bone from her plate.
However, I do promise to use every
means of persuasion I can muster...
to prove to you that my client, Michael Jones,
did not commit the crime of first-degree murder,
but that he in fact shot Officer
Patrick O'Leary in self-defense.
Humorous yet restrained.
Rhetorical yet substantive.
You managed to cover everything except the will of God.
I'm saving that for my closing.
I thought so. You cleared for miracles?
Cecil B. DeMille would be proud.
I'm glad I have a front-row seat.
Okay. What's the deal?
No deals today, buddy. You missed that boat.
I'm taking your boy to the max.
I'm not talking about that deal. I'm talking about
this deal. What gives? What do you want from me?
Do I look like I want something?
Why don't you take your mind games...
and run 'em by those dorks at the A.C.L.U.,
'cause I don't have time for this bullshit.
Oh, yeah. I forgot. Your star is rising
in the financial arena. Correct.
- Complete with Miss Right, I hear, too.
- Hey, look, Susan.
I loved you better than anybody's
ever gonna love you in your lifetime,
and you left me holding the bag.
You took a hike, remember?
Now, I can't figure it,
but I pull myself together, I move on,
and... boom... you show up here?
Well, look, I didn't ask for it
and I didn't want it,
so why don't we just sort of swing on
through this with a minimum of bloodshed?
In case you didn't grasp that,
I was crazy about you.
Isn't that your waking state?
Look, do me a favor, will ya? just tell
me so I can quit buggin' myself about it.
Just tell me why.
You were turning cynical
and judgmental and berating and mean.
Oh?
You concocted some bullshit story about how
credit cards were gonna save your life.
Why didn't you tell me that then?
I did... in my own way.
You just didn't hear it.
Oh.
I miss you, Roland.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what are we gonna do now?
Gentlemen, I got $10,000...
that says the Harlem Shuffle
gon' kick The Crackers ass.
Anybody want a piece,
see the man. All right?
Come on, baby.
Yo, yo, yo!
Whoo!
What we gon' do?
Win!
That's right!
Yeah! Yeah!
We're gonna win, man!
Oh, shit.
Hold this, baby.
Rydell, you know,
you could fuck up a wet dream.
Come on.
We gotta talk.
This is my play time.
Can I at least watch the race?
Sure. I ain't here
to give out parking tickets.
Let's get it on!
Shit.
Tough luck, Cracker.
Hey, get my money.
Now, what can I do for you?
- Richie Marks.
- What about him?
I see.
What's in it for me?
Evidence against you...
in the police department safe, disappears.
A hundred and forty-seven thousand dollars...
and seven pounds of cocaine...
just disappears,
from the police evidence safe, huh?
Won't be the first time.
I got your message.
You the new boy at the precinct.
You'll find out I always pay my bills.
But the people I work for
are just a little pissed off.
What the fuck happened in Central Park?
A one-time, small-time mistake.
Ain't gonna happen again.
Fifty “K” a month,
and midtown north is yours.
Don't be worryin'
about no Michael Jones.
I'm gonna clean up
that mess personally.
But you... are gonna have to
take care of Richie Marks.
It's a deal.
You do your thing.
I'll take care of Marks pronto.
I forgot how much I love this room.
My tree house.
I forgot how much
I love listening to you.
I forgot how much
I love having you here.
You like to lie in bed
and chitchat, don't you?
Except you do most of the talking.
Yeah, I do.
I gotta go..
I won't be your mistress, Dalton.
Well, I just can't not show up.
Make it easier for both of us.
This time it was what it was.
If there's a next time,
you have to stay the whole night.
So I just put a bow on that package
and present it to my fiancee?
That's up to you, my dear.
I said, does the defense
have any questions?
Oh. I'm sorry.
Yes, Your Honor, we do.
We have some questions.
Uh, Officer Varelli,
when you came upon the scene, you recognized
the deceased to be a police officer.
- Is that right?
- Yes, I did.
In fact, you knew him to be
an undercover police officer...
investigating narcotics in your area,
correct?
That's correct.
When you... When you
approached Officer O'Leary,
he was lying on the ground unconscious.
Objection.
Conclusion.
Sustained.
Okay, uh, Officer Varelli,
his eyes were closed?
Yes.
He was not moving?
No, he wasn't.
- It was dear to you that he was not
in any semblance of mind... Objection! Conclusion.
Sustained.
Officer Varelli, when you
arrived upon the scene,
were there any other police officers
in the proximity, except for your partner?
No.
To the best of your knowledge,
isn't it correct police procedure...
when an officer is going to make
a narcotics arrest on the street...
to have some sort of backup presence, some sort
of assistance, some sort of support or protection?
Usually that's the case.
Well, in your experience,
don't you find it highly unusual,
if an officer's gonna be engaged in the
dangerous circumstances of a narcotics arrest,
to be proceeding alone?
Objection!
Your Honor, this is conjecture.
What is usual for Officer Varelli
may not be for someone else.
Patrick O'Leary was
an undercover policeman.
What his particular procedure was,
we do not know.
Sustained.
In any event, Officer Varelli,
Officer O'Leary's partner never arrived,
nor did anyone else
resembling a human being...
who claimed to have any work with him.
- True?
- That's true.
So what you saw was, you saw a man
lying on the ground who was shot.
But you did not actually see anyone
do the shooting, did you?
Of course not. I already said I wasn't there.
But it's obvious what happened.
No, I submit to you that it is not
obvious what happened.
It is not obvious, but it is fair to say
that you assumed what happened...
because you were not there, Officer Varelli,
and you did not see what happened.
Right.
I already said that. Right.
And your assumption was
that Patrick O'Leary,
in the middle of a narcotics arrest,
was shot by Michael Jones.
But since you were not there,
you could assume anything.
You could assume, as a matter of fact,
that maybe Patrick O'Leary shot himself.
Or maybe you could assume,
because you were not there,
that Patrick O'Leary did not identify himself as
a police officer because his badge was not out,
and you could assume, Officer Varelli,
that Patrick O'Leary pulled his gun
out first and shot Michael Jones,
Objection! planning to kill him
and steal his money and his drugs!
Objection! Could you assume that, Officer Varelli?
Bullshit!
Mr. Dalton, you will please
approach the bench.
Nice moves.
Dazzling, aren't I?
But what do you got after that, though?
Hang on tight, partner.
Oh, I see. The ride gets rougher than this.
You betcha.
That's just the way I like it.
You'd better watch out.
I can roll with anything you put out, buddy.
Yeah, you're a regular bronc buster.
That's what's called a discreet turn of the phrase, right?
You got it, cowboy.
Well, I'm gonna brand you this time,
horsie, so everybody knows you're mine.
How's that grab you?
Oh, yeah? Where's your iron?
Tell her.
Can you handle this,
or is this too real for you?
Yeah, I can handle it.
Just do me a favor, will ya?
Professional or personal?
Personal.
Done.
Whisper “yippee-yi-oh“ in my ear.
Roland!
- Hi!
- Oh, hi, Gail.
How are you, doll?
Mr. Feinberger.
Roland.
Can you believe it?
I told Daddy we were having lunch, and he
said that he was free and he'd join us.
Can you imagine Daddy being free for lunch?
I can't.
Let's do it.
Ow!
Come on. Come on.
Oh! God!
Attempted murder of a police officer.
That's gonna get your friend here
three years in the joint.
What you gonna do?
Gonna go along with him,
or you wanna assume the position...
and let me bust you for loitering
or some other bullshit charge?
I know what you're thinking.
You're young and fast,
and I'm old and slow.
What are you gonna do, asshole?
Dumb fuckin' question.
Police officer!
- Everybody get down!
- Get down! Get down!
Get outta my way!
Get back! Get back!
Get back! Get back!
Fuck you, Marks!
No, actually, asshole, it's...
fuck you.
Oh, Jesus.
Better get a shovel.
Wow.
Who's writing this report?
Yeah, yeah, Sorry.
Huh?
Good morning.
Yeah.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You want something to eat?
Yes, I want something to eat.
God, I love you.
I didn't tell her.
I lied to her, told her I was going to Boston.
And she believed you?
Yeah. Why wouldn't she?
Sure.
Don't be so sure, Dalton.
Women aren't stupid.
I wanted to tell her. I wanted to, but
then her dad showed up for lunch.
Oh, so your guts dried up
in the face of Daddy Warbucks.
Now, is this gonna be some kind of
female territorial doo-wop?
- You know, you really piss me off.
- Here we go.
This isn't about me.
This is about you.
Yeah, I'm a woman, and I'm jealous.
So what?
This is about you...
and who you are,
and who you really wanna be.
You know, you really lose the best
of yourself when you're around the gold.
Now here we are, one year ago, back in
the high-jive self-realization riff.
So you're gonna take 14 years of Legal
Aid and chuck it out the window.
You just don't get it, do you?
I mean, you got me as some kind of
retrograde Clarence Darrow or something.
You just don't get it.
You keep thinking I'm leaving Legal
Aid 'cause I wanna be somewhere else.
I'm outta here, babe, because it's
kicking the life out of me. See?
Day in and day fucking out...
with the scumbags and the jerk-offs
and the sex creeps...
and the freaks and the killers.
Goddamn it!
I can't live in it anymore.
And God forbid I get somebody,
just one somebody who's innocent
and I can't prove it,
so instead of risking a loss...
I gotta plea-bargain his ass so he
doesn't do eight years of hard time...
he ends up only doing one, in Attica
with the rest of the human puke.
But that doesn't matter anyway, because after
one year in that nightmare, his life is over.
And so what if I want things...
Susan?
People want shit, you know.
I want things!
I know.
Life's a bitch, huh, Roland?
Why do you think it's so goddamned
manifest destiny for me...
to be picking shit with the chickens
the rest of my life?
Because you love it.
You love it to death.
And of everything you do,
it's the thing you do best.
Now, Mr. Mastrangelo, you stated
that you owned and operated...
a reputable, honest
exotic automobile business, right?
Yes, I did.
The Casa d'Oro Custom Car Emporium.
Correct?
That's right.
Sounds like a brothel in Tangiers.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
You also stated that
Officer O'Leary purchased...
a customized turbo Porsche Cabriolet.
Right.
And that he paid $87,300 for it?
Right.
How did he pay for it?
Cash. He paid cash.
And did you give him a warranty?
- No.
- Did you give him a receipt?
No.
So, in fact, there is no record
of this actual transaction.
We have some records.
But we recently moved locations
and, uh, they got lost in the shuffle.
So you would just have this court take your
word for it that this actually occurred.
- Well, it's the truth.
- And you would tell the truth because you're an honest and reputable man.
Objection, Your Honor. The district attorney is
obviously badgering and ridiculing this witness.
Overruled.
Isn't it a fact
that on February 10, 1984,
you were convicted of trafficking
interstate stolen automobiles?
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Sustained.
Miss Cantrell.
No more questions.
Your Honor, at this time I would
like to call as my last witness...
the defendant, Michael Jones.
Will the defendant please rise...
and approach the witness box.
Swear him in.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do. For the record, state your full
name, your occupation and where you live.
Michael Ezekial Jones.
I'm a drug dealer.
I live in Rikers Island Prison.
The witness may take the stand.
Michael Jones.
Michael Ezekial Jones.
Now, Michael,
would you tell us,
in your own words,
exactly what happened to you
on Friday night, October 9,
approximately 10:00 p.m...
in Central Park, near the west side
61st Street pedestrian tunnel.
I was selling drugs.
A white guy came up to me,
asked to buy lightnin'...
the stuff you call crack.
I told him I had some.
He said he only had big bills.
I said I had plenty change.
He reached into his jacket,
and instead of pulling out his wallet,
he pulled out a gun.
He looked at me in my eye and said,
“Good-bye, nigger.“
I thought he was gonna kill me.
I didn't know he was no cop.
I... I went for my gun.
He fired, and I fired.
I remember gettin' hit.
I don't remember no more.
I, uh...
I was one of the first two cops
to come upon the O'Leary death scene.
I'm the one that booked the evidence.
The black kid's ghetto blaster,
when I found it,
was in the “record“ position.
Did you listen to the tape?
No.
I've heard rumors.
I don't even wanna know if they're true.
Why are you telling me this now?
One of the cops that got killed in
Times Square by that scale you finally got...
was my brother.
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen, if I
give this information to the defense attorney?
A lot of brother officers are gonna go down
in the investigation this thing causes.
Yeah, this is Police Officer Marks.
I got an emergency call
for defense attorney Roland Dalton.
Mr. Jones,
have you ever been arrested
for selling crack before?
Yeah.
And when you were arrested was the officer
wearing a uniform or street clothes?
Street clothes.
And also when you were arrested, did he pull out
his badge and say, “Hello, I'm a police officer“?
Or did he try to buy some drugs
and make a deal...
Your Honor, excuse me.
I request a personal emergency recess.
Your Honor, I object to this transparent ploy.
Excuse me, Your Honor. I know it seems hideously
contrived, except I request an emergency personal recess.
Well, it's 10 minutes of 4:00.
This court will recess
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.
Excuse me... Gail?
Oh, wait! Hi!
Gail... Hi. Richie Marks is waiting for me.
He's got something...
I gotta talk to you about something.
I gotta talk to you.
There's something very important I
have to tell you... Wait. I'm pregnant.
Isn't that great?
God! Really?
Yeah.
Oh. Well...
Well...
Gail...
Listen, this is great...
I threw up this morning.
You did?
Richie Marks is waiting for me with a thing...
Oh. Okay.
Uh, no, sweetie, we'll...
Tonight.
Bye.
Come on. Come on.
Get your hands off me.
Come on! I'm just gonna get some candy!
Uh, Sergeant, my name is Roland Dalton.
I'm from Legal Aid.
I got a court order here giving
me access to your evidence room.
Did you hear me?
Well, can you read?
This is a court order.
Up the fucking stairs!
Thanks.
Oh, no.
I'm gettin' out of here.
Come on. It's over.
Come here. Come here.
Hey. Sit down. Sit down.
Come back here.
Mr. Christian, sit down.
Come here.
Evidence Room.
Dalton's coming up.
All right. Thanks.
Yo, I got a court order here...
that grants me access to certain evidence
in the Jones-O'Leary case.
This is a court order. Dig?
Oh, Christ. This is a shame.
My key just broke off in the lock.
It did?
Yeah.
Well, I don't suppose between you and the putz
downstairs you got a pair of bolt cutters.
Well, Maintenance does, but they knock off at,
uh, 5:00. You have to come back in the morning.
In the morning.
Yeah.
Thanks.
You know, uh...
You cops, you're the best
that money can buy.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
So, what were you looking for?
True love.
Isn't that what we're all looking for?
That's cute.
That's very cute.
So, you're a tough guy, huh?
What were you looking for?
I think I wish to speak to my lawyer.
Al Fallon of Legal Aid.
Just speak to my asshole, huh?
What were you looking for?
What the fuck are you doin'?
Shut the fuck up!
Let's play again.
You got lucky last time.
The tape. Okay, the tape.
The tape.
What tape?
The tape... M... Michael Jones recorded
everything on the tape recorder.
The tape's in the ghetto blaster.
Play the fucking tape.
What the fuck is that?
Thank you, man.
Good-bye, nigger.
Alright, don't get nervous.
I'm going downstairs
to the fire alarm box.
When the bell goes off...
shoot him.
- I shoot him?
- Yeah.
His fingerprints are all over the bolt
cutter and the evidence room locker.
I haven't got a clean gun.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
There are 245,000 of those police
specials floating around New York City.
By the time they figure this
shit out, we'll be long gone.
This your evidence?
Here's your evidence.
Well, hurry up
and go pull the goddamn thing!
Just do it.
Where's Dalton?
Third floor, interrogation room.
He's waiting for his lawyer.
Hello, baby?
Daddy's coming home real soon.
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Oh!
Goddamn! Oh, fuck!
Richie, get that tape!
The tape! The tape!
Goddamn it, man, they...
How you cloin'?
They had the gun...
They had the gun at my head.
Court-
I gotta get to...
Listen... Listen... Okay?
I gotta... Court, man...
Goddamn it, what a world.
What a fucking world.
Do I know you?
Hey! I recognize you from TV.
You're the guy defending the cop killer.
- Alleged cop killer. Alleged.
- What, you mean he didn't do it?
- Yeah, man, he did it, but he did it in self-defense.
- Really?
Yeah, really.
- Hey they coming after you?
- Yep. Yep. They're coming after me.
Why? Well, because a bad cop lied to 'em,
and I know the truth.
And if they know I know the truth,
a lot of bad cops are in deep fucking trouble.
So let's go to court. Hey, I
studied the constitution.
I passed my citizenship test.
You got a right to be at the court.
I'll get you to court. You hold on.
Yeah?
Oh yeah?
Hey, fuck you!
Bring it up!
Yahoo!
Mr. Dalton! What in
hell is going on here?
Your Honor, I have a court order.
I have evidence that...
This tape is... Police officers, don't...
It's vital you hear the truth...
Bailiff, bring Mr. Dalton
to my chambers.
- Your Honor, I have to arrest him.
- On the street, you are the law.
But on the steps of this courthouse,
I am the law.
If this police officer does not lower his gun,
arrest him for obstructing justice.
Go ahead, white bread.
Make my day.
Judge Maynard, there's evidence
on this tape... Mr. Dalton!
The legal ramifications
that would allow you to testify...
about what you heard,
or maybe didn't hear, on this tape...
or even if this tape is, in fact, the tape that was in
Michael Jones's radio at the time of the alleged incident...
I mean, it boggles the mind!
I cannot allow it
to be introduced as evidence.
Now, Miss Cantrell...
will complete
her cross -examination,
and then both of you
will give your closing arguments.
And then I will give this case
to the jury.
And, Mr. Dalton, if the jury
should rule against you,
you can exercise your right of appeal.
And that is that.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I'd like to...
give you a few words from the
book of Matthew, if I may...
chapter 10, verses 26 and 27.
“There is nothing covered up
that shall not be uncovered;
“There is nothing hidden
that shall not be known.
“Whatever I say to you in the dark
you must repeat in the daylight,
and whatever is whispered
you must shout from the rooftops.“
Now, the truth...
the truth ain't always pleasant.
But the truth, however, is...
always the truth.
Now, the prosecution...
would have you believe that this is
just some simple, straightforward case...
a bad man shoots down...
a decorated police officer
in the line of duty...
to avoid one more
in a long series of endless arrests.
However, I say...
that Officer Patrick O'Leary...
was not working in the line of duty
Friday night, October 9,
and I say that Officer Patrick O'Leary
made a lot of money...
stealing from drug dealers.
And I also say that Patrick O'Leary,
on Friday night, October 9,
didn't even bother to identify himself
to my client, Michael Jones.
If he had, he'd be alive today.
You've already heard Michael Jones
acknowledge to you,
admit, confess time and time again under
cross-examination by the district attorney,
that he considered it
standard operating procedure,
simply the cost of doing business,
to pay off cops.
But Officer Patrick O'Leary
pulled out his gun...
before he pulled out his badge.
And my client, Michael Jones,
thought he was some kind of nut.
Hey, so would I.
Wouldn't you?
And after being shot once,
point-blank,
by Patrick O'Leary.
My client, drug dealer or no,
pulled out his own gun
and fired in self-defense.
The prosecution's case
rests on two points. One...
Gotta cut me loose.
What?
C-Can't do the time.
Won't make it...
inside this go-round.
Can't do the time.
You can't do the time.
You can't do the time, Michael?
But you can take money from these 10-year-old
kids and blow holes in their lives...
with that poison you push?
Now you wanna cry on my shoulder
'cause you can't do the time?
Stand up.
Hey, man, chill out.
Stand up!
I'm standing!
You stand too!
Jury's back.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
Will the defendant please rise
and face the jury.
Will the foreman read the verdict.
The jury finds the defendant...
not guilty.
That's great, Mike.
See you in jail.
I dig these love notes in class, Richie.
What's the haps?
Carr and Rydell
are headin' for the airport.
Wanna drive, or wanna shoot?
I'll drive, you shoot!
Hey, baby.
It's not forever.
I'll be back.
Besides, Costa Rica's
just a puddle hop away.
Richie, this is O'Leary's wheels.
You copped O'Leary's car.
I didn't think he'd give a shit.
Come on! Keep going!
So long, sucker.
- Jesus Christ!
- Losing hydraulics!
The landing gear won't retract!
Tower, this is 750-Alpha-Charlie!
Flame out.
Flame out, port engine.
Shut it down!
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
LaGuardia Tower, we have to land!
- Roger.
- 750-Alpha-Charlie, come in.
LaGuardia Tower, transfer...
Richie, I love ya, pal,
but you are definitely
new to the planet.
Roland?
I have a confession to make.
What?
The rabbit.
It never died.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want to lose you.
Everyone, there's something
I need to tell you.
I lost the baby.
I'm not pregnant anymore.
Oh, Gail, I...
it's okay.
I really don't even want
to talk about it.
Besides, we have loads of time
for children.
And now I'm not gonna have to
buy that larger wedding dress.
Uh, R-Roland.
Speaking of the wedding,
your mother and I must get together.
The plaza only seats 600,
and I'm afraid that
with all of our friends...
only some of the relatives
will be able to come.
Relatives.
Well...
Excuse me.
Uh, Gail.
Mr. Feinberger, Mrs. Feinberger,
I know this is real bad timing,
but...
Arrests: statutory rape, possession
of concealed weapon, Yo, Dalton!
I thought you went to Wall Street.
Possession of crack, crack, crack-
This I gotta hear.
Hey, Boesky!
