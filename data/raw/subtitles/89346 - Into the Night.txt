# So tired of strugglin ' that
my mind can barely think #
# I don 't know
where I'm goin '#
# Lord, I don 't know
what I'm gonna do #
# My fuel supply is finished#
# There ain 't nothin 'left
to burn #
# I need someone to help me #
# But I don 't know
which way to turn #
# I know I don 't have much
of a choice #
# I'll go out of my mind#
# Or into the night #
# I'm rollin' and tumblin'#
# Spinnin' end over end#
# Got to have
some peace and quiet #
# So I can find myself again #
# Still if you ask me
what's the matter #
# I just don't know
what to say #
# There's people all around me
but I feel so alone #
# I guess they'd like
to help me #
# But I have to do it
on my own #
# I know I don't have much
of a choice #
# I'll go out of my mind#
# Or into the night #

[ Birds Chirping ]
[ woman ]
Do you want some coffee?
Just a minute.
What did you say?
Do you want me to make you some coffee?
No. No, thanks.
Aren't you hungry?
Oh, yeah, sure.
What's the matter, Ed?
Why aren't you sleeping?
{ Sighs }
I don't know.
Well, what can I do?
Just love me, okay?
[ CarHorn Honks ]
Oh, that's Stan.
What is it?
Am I doing something wrong?
- No, of course not.
- Well, what is it?
I don't know.
[Horn Honking]
Oh, we better go.
Herb's probably
going berserk by now.
- Herb can wait.
- I gotta go.
Have a nice day.

we've got a slowdown on that

[Announcer #4 ]
This is the Dave Hull program
on KRLA,
but we are gonna
interrupt the show now
for this special announce--
{ T urns Off Radio }
Don't you want to hear
what happened?
No, not really.
If it's important, I guess
they'll let us know anyway.
Ah, a smilel
Okay, now we're
gettin' somewhere.
All right, Mr. No-Sleep,
I have something for you.
What's three miles long
and has an I.Q of 165?
A Saint Patrick's Day parade.
Actually,
it's a Cinco de Mayo parade.
I can't sleep anymore,
Herb.
Are you gonna be all right?
I don't wantyou nodding off
at the wheel.
No, no, I'm fine.
We can switch.
I'm fine. I'm okay.
{ Sighs }
I don't know.
I don't know.
My job is a dead end.
I feel weird,
like I'm from another
planet or something.
Ellen kissed me on the top
of my head this morning
and said, "Have a nice day. "
- Can you believe that?
- What's wrong with that?
Bank tellers say,
"Have a nice day."
The cashier at the supermarket
says, "Have a nice day."
I just think that somehow
yourwife should say something
better than, "Have a nice day."
You're losing your mind, Ed.
How long have you had insomnia?
My last good night's sleep?
Yeah, the full eight hours.
Seems like... 1980.
Yeah, the summer of 1980.
{ Chuckles }
[Herb]
You're in bed. You can't sleep.
I don't see the problem.
You go to the airport,
catch the midnight flight
to Las Vegas.
Nobody sleeps there.
Very funny, Herb.
No, listen, I'm serious.
You need some action.
I'm not a gambler.
Don't gamble.
Have a few drinks.
See a show.
Get loose.
Get laid.
Oh, wonderful.
I'm sure Ellen would love it.
You'll be home
before she wakes up.
Sex isn't the problem.
When was the last time
you fucked your wife?
You're a classy guy, Herb.
Up in Vegas, there's
a beautiful, young girl
named Melissa.
She will do anything
you want for $200 an hour.
Two hundred dollars?
Anything you want.
Anything.
For example?
if you want,
she'll dress up
like Santa Claus.
Would she bring me a pony?
You're having trouble
with this concept.
I'm talking about the universe
of infinite possibility.
No such thing.
The only limits are
money and imagination.
Sorry.
I'm a little short on both.
Hello, Fielding.
{ Indistinct Greeting }
{ Sighs }
How much would I have to pay one
of these women for sympathy?
Sympathy?
Very kinky, Ed.
I'll see you at lunch.
{ Clears Throat }

Ed Okin.
They're claiming we've got
a synchronization problem.
Naturally, this has nothing
to do with their god-awful
carrier tracking loop.
{ Engineers Chuckling }
They want full tolerance
checks on all buggers,
sensors and corresponding
transducers.
{ Groaning }
Scanners seem to check out.
Yeah, but that's on the uplink.
The problem is downlink.
Ed, have you got
the signal-to-noise ratio
on the downlink?
Ed?
Yeah?
- have you got it?
- What's that?
Yep, we're having
synchronization problems.
I need the signal-to-noise ratio
on the downlink.
Signal-to-noise.
Right. Um, mm-hmm.
Right.
I've got it here.
[Flipping Pages ]
I was just, uh--
Uh... signal-to-noise,
signal-to-noise.
Signal-to-noise: 5.3 db.
[Engineer]
Five point three?
What modulation scheme?
- Uh, B.P.S.k.
- "B.P.S.k."?
Isn't that correct?
we switched
to Q.P.S.K. two weeks ago.
Q.P.S.K.?
It was incredible.
I can't tell you
how I felt.
It was incredible.
I can't tell you
how I felt.
[Engineer]
I wish I'd seen it.
The whole place was excited.
I couldn't talk my wife
out of going to the orchid show.
Everyone was there.
[Lunch Chatter Overlapping]
- if you missed it,
you can see it on cable.
- His family was there.
Listen, I'm gonna go home
and try to take a nap.
If I don't come back,
can you get another ride?
Sure. Absolutely.
Go home and get some sleep.
Yes.
He's been having trouble
sleeping lately.

I'll take you to your car.
Let's just
get out of here.
do you know where downtown
they take the cars?
I've gotta get ahold
of Hamid. Shit.
do you know where to go?
No, I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.
We're going to find my car.
Would you help me, please?
Just a little more.
No! I've gotta go home.
No more.
I've got problems
of my own to deal with.
How do you think I feel?
You're all I've got.
Well, that's hard
to believe.
You're tellin' me.
if you want any more
help from me, I wanna
know what's going on.
You wanna know
what's going on?
Yes.
All right.
Have a seat.
Okay.
They killed him.
- killed who?
- Hasi.
"Hasi"?
In the parking lot.
I-- I was with him.
He was waiting for me.
The stones were his.
- We have to get the police.
- No, I can't. I smuggled them in.
- What stones?
- Six perfect emeralds.
They're priceless.
They killed this guy
for six emeralds?
How'd you get involved in all this?
The stones are from the scepter
of an ancient Persian king.
Remember when the Shah fell
and the royal family fled Iran?
The treasury was looted.
Somebody got away with
a good part ofthe crown jewels.
Hasi was "somebody's" cousin.
Um... he was gonna
give me $25,000.
So I went to Zurich.
I went to a vault.
Everything went fine.
He met me at the airport.
- Who killed Hasi?
- They wanted the stones.
If I lose the stones,
I'm dead for sure.
{ Sighs }
The police can't help me.
I'm one of the bad guys.
Who were those men
chasing you at the airport?
I don't know.
I've got to make some kind
of deal with them.
- With who?
- That's what I have to find out.
I know they're all Iranians
or Persians or something. I--
If they're on visas,
they don't want trouble.
Well, this is kind
of outside my field.
Oh, Christ.
I can't get ahold of Jack.
He would help me.
- Who's Jack?
- He's a friend of mine.
- Is he involved in this?
-Jack? No!
Jack doesn't need any more money.
I guess he doesn't
need me anymore either.
{ Clears Throat }
Maybe if you explained
to the police that you
were doing a job--
{ Laughing }
That I'm a smuggler?
No.
{ Stammering }
Okay, so now what?
I know someone else
who could help me.
Would you help me
get to him?
{ Sighs }
It's my only way out of this.
No.
You did it before
at the airport.
I'm not sure what I did
at the airport.
You saved my life.
They don't know who you are.
Right now they don't know
where I am.
Just stay with me
for a little while longer.
How do you know
you can trust me?
Because I know men.
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What am I doing here?
This is insane.
I'd do it myself,
but I don't know who's there.
I promise I won't ask
anything else.
{ Iranian }
{ Sniffing, Iranian }
{ Laughing }
This is awfully good, sir.
I think you can feel
very confident with that.

- Is he the one with the wife?
- Yeah, the one I can't reach.
- Was that his boat?
- Yes.

How would you explain
whatyou were doing
up in Hamid's penthouse?
I was worried about you.
Some woman who jumps
into your car at the airport?
That's the truth.
Well, the truth
will put me in jail.
We should try
to see Jack.
Jack Caper?
Yes, the one
with the boat.
The one with the wife?
He's a very rich man.
I was his mistress.
I, um, I was modeling
and, uh,
t-trying to, you know,
make it as an actress.
Mostly, I hung out a lot.
I-I metJack at a party.
we went to Europe together
for fun, and it just
sort of evolved.
He gave me an apartment
in Westwood, and, um,
credit cards, my Porsche.
It was easy. It was nice.
- How long?
- Five years.
Five years?
You must have been 16.
I'm not as young as I look.
About six months ago,
I get this call from his lawyer.
I had to move out.
My credit cards were canceled.
He let me keep the Porsche.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
He won't talk to me.
What aboutyou?
What do you do?
I work
for Communtronics.
A recording studio?
I'm an aerospace engineer.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
That sounds fascinating.
Does it really?
Well, yeah, sort of.
What wereyou doing
at the airport?
- It's kind ofhard to explain.
- Try me.
I can't sleep.
Soyou went to the airport?
My life isn't working out
somehow.
Soyou went to the airport?
My wife is unfaithful to me.
Oh. Your wife's
having an affair.
That makes it sound romantic.
- Well, maybe it is.
- Thank you.
- Well, maybe it is.
- Thank you.

we know you're on probation

I'm gonna ask you one more time.
do you know what they were
looking for?

I got myself into trouble,
and he's the only one I've
been able to count on.

- Get her out, Larry.
Whoeveryou are,
or thinkyou are,
there have been a dozen
just like you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to come here.
You better hurry
and tell me the problem.
Hasi's dead.
Hasi's dead?
Yeah.
Hamid too.
How?
Hasi sent me to Zurich
to get some stones
out of a safety box.
Theywere left
to him and--
He needed money in a hurry,
and he used you to get 'em
into the country.
That little shit.
People have been trying
to kill me too.
Yeah, Larry told me
about the men in the boat.
Must be Shaheen.
Hasi's aunt?
Did you ever meet her?
Hard as nails.
She's got a deal
in escrow.
Major development
downtown.
Escrow closes in a week,
and she's gotta come up
with a bundle.
She called me
for a short-term loan,
a big one,
but, uh,
I didn't need the headache.
She mentioned that she might
take Hasi in as a partner,
if he could
raise enough cash.
She had to know
about the stones.
Wait a minute. This is all
about a real estate deal?
- She can have them.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
- A real estate deal?
Honey, you know enough
to get 'em locked up
or deported.
My wife sells real estate.
Not to mention blackmail
and murder.
It's not just the stones
anymore.
You're gonna have
to negotiate with Shaheen.
Negotiate?
Offer to sell her the stones.
She'll understand that.
- What about the Frenchman?
- What Frenchman?
Someone else who wants to kill us.
Well, whoever he is,
he can't possibly be
as dangerous as Shaheen.
- What do we do?
- Go around by my office.
The number's on the Rolodex.
- Shaheen Parvizi.
- Parvizi, right.
I'll just
wait outside.
Okay.
You get out of the country
and start again.
This'll probably be
the best thing that ever
happened to you, Peach.
I thought you hated me.
{ Sniffling }

But only three.

- Whose good faith?
- Yours and mine.
- Where are the other three?
- Diana's hiding them as we speak.
- Where?
- I don't know.
- I should believe that?
Can I help you?
Wherever they are right now,
it'll be somewhere where they
can be discovered by anyone...
or destroyed,
so we don't have much time.
do you have the money?
At this bulk, Miss Bailey,
I can give you
a very good price.
Whatever it costs.
You only get married once.
Only when she's sure
about her safety, she'll call.
She'll tell you where they
can be found. You'll never
hear from her again.
Then you wait for the call
with me as long as it takes.
No, she makes the call
when we're reunited,
when I'm safe too.
{ Chuckles }
You expect me to believe
you won't take the other half?
Good faith.
We could've taken them all.
How do you know she
has not already run away,
Ieft you behind with me?
I don't. It's a risk
we'll both have to take.
This girl goes with anyone
who takes care ofher.
She gives herself away
like a fool.
She has nothing ofher own,
only what's given
or what she takes.
This is a foolish risk.
Right now
there's really no choice.
for you maybe.
Aren't they beautiful?
Oh, yes. Gorgeous.
Mrs. Parvizi will be by
to pick them up in a few hours.
[Ed]
All she wants is the money
and no more trouble.
- Who are you?
- That's all she wants.
Just what was promised her
and her safety.
- What about you?
- I'm just a friend.
A friend?
Of Jack Caper's too?
You drive his car.
What do you want?
She said she'd split
the money with me.
All this risk for $ 12,500?
{ Laughing }
No. Please.
- No, of course not.
- Then why?
The last thing you'd believe
is anything close to the truth.
The truth is...
I'm not sure I know.
Somebody had to help her.
I happened to be in the wrong place
at the right time.
- How much did Melville offer?
- [Ed] The French guy?
we rejected his offer.
Twenty-five thousand
dollars is nothing.
I do not understand.
Okay, you give me
the money in cash.
when I see Diana, we 'll call
and tellyou the location
ofthe other three stones.
It's simple.
Too simple.
why? what is it?
what's wrong with our plan?
There has to be a catch,
a trick.
I do not trust your plan.
I think it's a very good plan.
Come on. Time's running out.
Escrow is closing.
- Did Jack Caper tell you that?
- Yes, that's right.
- I'm Jack's son.
- His son?
Illegitimate.
But some day it'll all be mine.
You and I might be doing
business, going out to lunch.
All right, okay, fine.
I'll tell you the truth.

We've got the place surrounded.

or you have to take
a chance on me.
Neither of us
have much to lose.
If he's still there, you better
let him go if you ever want
to see those stones alive.
A-Again.
Ever.
I promise if I'm followed,
I'll go straight to the police.
Besides, it might
take every one of you
to retrieve the stones.
They could be scattered

This is ridiculous.
Big shot, huh?

Let me askyou something.
Maybe you can help me.

What are you doing?
{ Iranian }
Will somebody tell me
what we're doing here?
Well, at least
we're not dead.
Maybe we are,
we just don't know it.
When you die, you don't
go to a Ramada Inn.
How do you know?
[Indistinct Chattering,

And, uh,
what's happening here?
Sorry, Mrs. Parvizi,
but you'll have to come with us.

Can we see you in here
for a minute, please?

- Are we under arrest or what?
- I'd say you'd fall into
the "or what" category.
- Are you a policeman?
- I'm a federal agent.
Feel better?
will you gentlemen
excuse us, please?

[Door Opens, Closes ]
{ Unlatching Case }
I don't know
what's going down here,
and I don't want to know.
All I know is that this money's
clean, and I'm supposed
to give it to you.
- For what?
- Someone--
- Someone very important
must like you.
-Jack.
There's $750,000 right there.
All this money is for us?
{ Sighs }
Who you gonna tell?
You got 24 hours undisturbed.
You're not to leave this room.
After that, you're on your own.
- Do we Thank you or what?
- Follow the "or what" category.
