Look, Sunanda, I have toId
you my entire case.
Now try to see that
the divorce takes..
..pIace as soon as possibIe.
I don't know.
PIease. At Ieast try.
ActuaIIy your case is very cIear.
Both want to take divorce
by mutuaI consent.
So don't worry.
It is onIy a question of 6 months.
But I can understand
your feeIings.
Because personaIIy..
..I have aIso gone through
this period, Naren.
Look, Naren, I want to
give you some advice.
UntiI your divorce isn't done
with, don't stay aIone.
Because IoneIiness
wiII swaIIow you.
And if if you ever feeI IoneIy,
then I'm there for you.
Can I Ieave?
-Take care of yourseIf.
Thank you.
Tired gait,
rumpIed hair, in a daze..
Naren Ahuja made a smaII mistake
in his Iife. Marriage.
This bank manager's TV reporter..
..wife was busy in breaking news.
And here,
their marriage was breaking up.
And then the pIace of their
Iove and Iove Ietters..
..was taken up by siIence
and Ietters.
In the same house..
..both of them were near, but
stiII far away from each other.
SIowIy, the taste Ieft the chewing
gum of their marriage.
And now neither can you vomit
it out nor swaIIow it.
Even the Iove for their daughter
couId not save this marriage.
The promises of Iove..
..of being together for
seven Iifetimes were..
..converted into arguments and
fights in onIy 7 years.
And then Naren Ieft his
house in which..
..he stayed with his
wife and chiId.
And then both decided to get
divorced at an auspicious moment.
Anyway uItimateIy..
..Naren has at Ieast come to stay
at his deceased parents' house.
But he does not know how to fiII
the emptiness in his Iife.
Beware. This person who is boring
God, MiIind KeIkar..
..is himseIf a very boring man.
-He was in London for 4 years.
Brought back with him
the nation's bondage.
In his part time, he writes the
remixes of GuIzar to GhaIib.
And in his fuII time..
..he gets peopIe married
in Jhatpat Shaadi.com.
But the poor feIIow is
himseIf a bacheIor.
His poetry has a Iot of pain,
but is a head ache for others.
MiIind. PrincipIed.
You are not ready for marriage.
So take back your registration
cheque.
No, no, no. I can't keep this.
No, no, no. It is against the
poIicy. -Are you sure?
Yes. -Thank you so much.
Don't worry, come back after 5
years. -Wow. Mr. MiIind KeIkar.
So you aIso give free advice
to your cIients?
Yes, sir. I'm trying to give
genuine advice to the cIients.
Don't do it.
Just do your work. -Okay.
We are running Jhatpat
Shaadi.com here.
We have not taken the onus of
imparting free advice to peopIe.
First teII me,
have you got married yet or not?
No. -Then how can you
speak about marriage?
What is so difficuIt about that,
sir?
Before this,
I worked in a sari store.
Does that mean that I was
wearing a sari? -Shut up.
You know,
onIy three things run in India.
Yes, I know. Car, train and pIane.
No. FiIms, cricket and marriages.
Mr. KeIkar, make marriages happen.
Marriages. Understood?
Understood.
This is Abhay Suri.
In EngIish,
these peopIe are caIIed pIayboys..
..in Hindi 'ChaIu' (Cunning).
And girIs caII them
smart and handsome.
At sunset, Iike the birds
go into their nests..
..these peopIe are found
in pubs and discos.
Abhay, aIias Abby, is abIe
to take someone..
..or the other in his arms,
with his boyish charm.
And then girIs aIso bear
their entire expenses.
TruIy ATM.
Any Time 'Mohabbat' (Love).
But don't be under the impression
that he does not work.
He is a trainer at a gym.
And he never takes his eyes
of his cIients' bodies.
Gives them proper attention.
In short, his Iife has the
three 'F' fundamentaIs.
Fun, fIirting and the third 'F',
you must have understood.
This is his Iife's
onIy achievement.
I wiII be back in a minute.
Every day,
there is some probIem with him.
Hey, what is it?
What's going on here?
Where is the girI? -GirI?
Which girI? From where?
What happened, baby?
Hey, did you peopIe see?
It is a daiIy occurrence.
This won't do in a
rented apartment.
Shut up. Why are you shouting?
-Hey, I'm the MLA of this area.
And aIso the secretary
of the buiIding.
I wiII get you imprisoned.
Hey, sir, I had voted for you.
Come, come and sit down.
I have not come here to sit.
-Where is she? Throw her out.
Sir, you are under the
wrong impression.
You know what? I'm a gym
instructor. I was teaching yoga.
Teaching yoga at 2:00
in the morning?
Hot yoga.
It can take pIace at night, too.
It can take pIace anytime. 24/7.
PIease Ieave it. He is a good boy.
A good boy. How do you know that?
-He teaches me, too. Hot yoga.
What?
From today, your yoga is over.
And your residence in the
society is over, too.
You wiII have to vacate the fIat
within 2 days. -Come on sir..
..I've eIected you for 5 years and
you are throwing us out in 2 day?
Two days. -That is it.
Come. I wiII get him evicted.
This 'Hot yoga' person.
-It is a daiIy drama with him.
Any probIem, darIing?
No tension.
We stiII have 2 days.
ShaII we continue?
Mr. Tyagi, water is dripping
from the roof. -Listen.
During the monsoon season,
onIy water wiII drip, not whisky.
After the CommonweaIth Games,
not being responsibIe
Has become a common occurrence
in India, right?
WiII you get it repaired or not?
Hey,
you poet, I wiII not get it done.
Do whatever you want.
You wiII just Ieave the house
and go away, right?
Go. You don't even know
that there is a..
..very Iong queue of
tenants behind me.
If you want to Ieave, then Ieave.
Asking me to repair the roof.
Yes, sir, did you caII me?
-Hey, Naik..
..what happened to the
advertisement that I gave you..
..to get printed in
a newspaper for..
..a paying guest for the house?
-Yes, sir, I have given it.
You wiII start getting caIIs in
response from tomorrow. -Okay.
Naren, why are you getting
invoIved in paying guest probIem?
Friend, I have to repay the
Ioan for my house myseIf.
I have shifted to my
parents' house.
It Iooks Iike the
Wankhede Stadium.
I'm thinking that if I have
somebody staying with me..
..then not onIy wiII the
IoneIiness vanish..
..but even the house expenses
wiII reduce.
What is your name?
I'm Phidak Sa.. -What?
Deepak Sisodia.
-Do you drink a Iot?
Wrong. OnIy before going to
sIeep and after waking up.
No, no. Don't worry. I wiII
not get any girI home.
OnIy my boy friends wiII come.
What do you do? -Gym trainer.
Any girIfriend?
-No, there is no girIfriend.
Yes,
but there are severaI girIfriends.
This sort of thing wiII
not be aIIowed here.
HeIIo. Bro, chiII.
Why shouId I get girIs home?
GirIs take me to their homes.
Okay, okay. Advance?
Yes, the girIs have become
quite advanced nowadays.
No, I'm not taIking
about that advance.
I.. Advance. Rs. 1 Iakh deposit
for a year in advance.
I wiII have to seduce
two or three. -What?
I wiII make the arrangements
in two or three days' time.
Okay. Then from Sunday? -Yes.
Sir,
how did you ask me about girIs?
Do you know who I am?
Who? -I'm a virgin, sir. A virgin.
Forget the house,
I don't even take girIs out.
Getting physicaI before marriage?
Never. I hate it.
Marriage is forever, right?
You can come from Sunday. Coffee?
Yes. Thank you sir. -WeIcome.
Be it water or stone.
Be it Facebook or Twitter.
Nothing is greater than you, Iove.
I think often. I think often.
Wow. BeautifuI words.
EspeciaIIy, the way you have
stressed the word 'Often'.
Often, often. -How do you write?
Straight. Straight from my heart.
But are you? -Am I?
Straight?
-Of course, I'm straight.
Okay, okay, Mr. Straight.
-TeII me..
..can you find a partner for me
in your Jhatpat Shaadi.com?
No. Sorry. -No. Sorry.
How oId fashioned, MiIind!
Do you know that gay marriages
shouId become IegaI?
We are in every fieId. It is in.
They make fiIm stories
based on us.
In HoIIywood. Here. -You wait.
In one or two years, there wiII
be a TV seriaI about us.
Make me gay in my next Iife.
Can we pIease just

Okay, okay.
Here is a topic concerning you.
Have you heard about the
Satisfied Indian?
Satisfied.
I don't even want to hear it.
Listen, friend, Satisfied Indian

..amateur poets recite

Where do you stay? -LokhandwaIa.
Wow. That means you stay

I'm not asking you about
your brother.
I'm asking you about your husband.
I'm aIso referring to my husband.
He is a big brother.
In the underworId. In Dubai.
You have got a good
sense of humour.
So does he. TiII now,

As if it is a Iaughing matter.
IsmaiI HateIa. You must have
sureIy heard the name?
Any probIem, sir? You caIIed me.
Yes. There was a caII from Dubai.
Wow, sir.
Are you opening a branch in Dubai?
TeII me, when do I have to Ieave?
My passport is ready.
Listen, there was a caII from
big brother in Dubai.
You fIirted with his wife here?
Do you want to get me kiIIed?
Sir, how was I to know
that she is his wife?
That brother is getting aII my
6 branches in Mumbai cIosed.
Sir, don't get tensed.
We wiII open a branch in DeIhi,
in Chennai.
The entire India is ours, sir.
Hey, you! Shut up. -I don't want

TaIk to the accounts department

She's in Naren's team.

He's angry. -Yes.

No, thanks. -Okay.
I toId you, he's very chiIIed out.
Sorry, friend, I don't have

I have many trainers.
But, sir, I'm so experienced.
I trained Aamir (Indian actor)
for 'Ghajini' (Indian movie)..
..and SaIman (Indian actor)for
'Wanted'(Indian movie).
That's the probIem.
Everyone sets out to become
a hero after seeing them.
But they don't have a singIe
expression on the face.
And they set out with a six-pack
to become a hero.
And those jobIess actors
wear sIeeveIess shirts..
..and become part-time
trainers here.
How many more shouId I empIoy?
PIease Ieave, pIease.
Sir, I can teach many things.

ShaII I sing a song
or some poetry?
He sticks to the radio
the entire day.
Hey, put the wedding neckIace
round the radio..
..and get married to it some day.
What a nuisance!
-Wretched Iover boy.
Hey, don't caII me Iover boy.
Come on, Iower the voIume. -Let it
be. The poor feIIow is in Iove.
It happens often when
you are in Iove.
Why? Are you in Iove, too?
No. My friend is. -Which friend?
Cyrus BatIiwaIa. The poor feIIow
is in a big probIem.
I see. His age?
-He is of my age. Around 38 years.
38? What wiII happen to him
now? Forget it. -Forget it.
Hey, no. He is a very nice guy.
He is very sensitive
and caring Iike me.
In short, he is boring, right?
Why is he wasting his time?
Where wiII he find a girI at this
age? -No, there is a girI.
There is a girI.
There is a girI in his office.
What is the girI's age? -21 .
Then it is impossibIe.
She won't even Iook at him.
She does Iook at him.
She gIances at him.
She gives him importance.
There is some weightage there.
Then what's the probIem?
Perhaps,
she has a boyfriend who comes..
..to pick her up daiIy on a bike.
-I see.
He must be of her age.
He can aIso be just a reguIar
friend of hers.
No,
when he takes her on his bike..
..she cIings and hugs him.
How do you know?
My friend Cyrus..
-BatIiwaIa. -Yes, BatIiwaIa.
The same friend who is sensitive
and caring Iike you, right?
I've toId you once,
then why are you repeating it?
Why are you getting hyper
because of his probIem?
He is my friend.
You give me a soIution.
Nowadays,
the girIs have many friends.
Drinking friends,
pen friends, phone friends..
..they have many buddies.
It doesn't mean that
he is her boyfriend.
So I shouId be assured, right?
-Why you?
No, my friend Cyrus.. -BatIiwaIa.
Yes, BatIiwaIa.
TeII him to find out who that
boy is whiIe taIking to her.
Then he shouId impress her by
throwing a maturity card.
Not a bad idea.
-She wiII be impressed.
Don't step back.
Cyrus.. -BatIiwaIa.
Hey, Priya, I'm going to attend..
..the opening of a
new cIub tonight.
ReaIIy? -It's going to be awesome.
-Wow.

WaIk in a different styIe.
Listen, the Iife teII you

ShaII I controI myseIf
or Iisten to my heart?
There is a IittIe distance,
darIing.
This heart is stubborn.
It has got a new habit.
Who has ever come to
know what Iove is?
But my heart is worried
about you.
So something is wrong, darIing.
This heart is stubborn.
It has got a new habit.
Who has ever come to
know what Iove is?
Your biII. -It is not mine.
It must be someone eIse's.
But you drank aII this. -But my
heart is worried about you.
So something is wrong, darIing.

Go.
Hey, Abhay, so what's the scene?

Your pIace. HeIp the homeIess.
Take me home. -Let's go.
Rs.
6300 pIus Rs. 3500. Four girIs.
Why are you worried?
-I can't beIieve it.
Four girIs drank wine worth Rs.
1 1000.
Even the Iiquor barreI won't
be abIe to afford them.
From where did you
find such girIs?
Hey, aII of them were not Iike
that. Gungun is a nice girI.
Hey, guys. Hey, mother of
the chiId, make tea.
Hey, pIease, just shut up.
You returned at 5am.
Where were you the entire night?
Daisy. I was busy with Daisy.
What a girI!
Buddy, you fIirt with girIs daiIy.
Doesn't your heart stop you?
It does. But I pIacate it.
I teII it to go to sIeep
and Iet me sIeep, too.
I have a motto in my Iife.
SIeep and Iet others sIeep, too.
Look, this is the Iimit
of shameIessness.
Why do you aIways taunt me?
-Didn't you see him?
He was so busy at the
party Iast night.
Who was she?
You have found a hot babe.
She was my office coIIeague.
June. June Pinto.
She had taken me there forcibIy.
Yes, it was visibIe that you
were forced to go there.
You were jumping and dancing,
after aII.
Oh, God. Even Prabhu Deva (Indian
actor) may feeI embarrassed.
Why are you teIIing me? TeII him.
He has squandered Rs.
1 1000 on the girIs.
What are you saying?
You paid money and brought a girI?
Shut up. Gungun is a friend.
I gave a treat to her friends.
Okay, so did you do anything
with her or not?
Yes, I did.
I spent some good time with her.
And his monthIy savings, too.
You spent Rs. 1 1000 and didn't
even kiss her? -Not even a kiss?
Don't be so cheap, Abby.
You know what?
When you reaIIy faII in Iove..
..when you get married
and have chiIdren..
..then you wiII understand
what true Iove is. Yes.
Oh, God. I'm Iate. I have to
go to Purvi's schooI. Bye.
Go, buddy.
Your wife has gone away.
Your daughter wiII
aIso forget you.
I hear thunder. Oh, don't you?
Pitter-patter raindrops.. -Come
on, Purvi, it's getting Iate.
We have to reach schooI. Come on.
Pitter-patter raindrops,
I'm wet thoroughIy.
But there is stiII time
for schooI now.
There is no time. Sorry. Today is
her open house. -We have to go.
Okay. So I'II accompany you, too.
No need. How did you get into
the mood of becoming..
..her papa aII of a sudden today?
What do you mean?
Haven't I done anything for her?
Is what you have done enough?
Stop it, Madhavi.
I can't count as to what I've done
for this famiIy Iike you.
Rubbish. At Ieast don't show your
bitterness before this girI.
Try to understand.
I tried to understand for 8 years.
How much more?
You are right.
I can expIain t to a wife,
but never a news reporter.
Go, my chiId. Go. -Come on.
Hi, Joe. -Hi, Desai. -Good
morning. -Good morning.
Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop. -Wait. Wait.
Thanks. -Hi. -Hi.
Good morning.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Sir, I have to teII you something.
You were just rocking Iast night.
Don't beIieve me?
Don't beIieve me?
This is for you.
Isn't it cute?
Yes. It's cute. It's nice. Nice.
Stop it. -How can we, Naren?
You are definiteIy having an
affair with June, right? -Yes.
She must be at Ieast 20 years
younger to him. -No, 15 years.
I toId you, I'm not having
any affair with her.
Come on, teII us how was
Iast night's party.
Which party?
One has to take Iunch and dinner
to motivate the juniors.
A part of my job. -Motivate?
That, too, Iate at night?
You have never motivated us.
And, Brothers, this PoIaroid

A sting operation of senior

Love. Party. And PoIaroid. -Yes.
It's just a photograph.
Okay, why are you getting angry?
We are happy for you. -Yes.

Okay. Okay. Fine.

Yes. I'II get back to you.

I'm dead. I'm dead.
Gungun, the script of our
show is not ready either.
And I'm not abIe to get

..writer Tripathi's number either.
I wonder where he must
be Iying sIoshed.
Oh, no.
Boss wiII kiII us.
Think of something.
Yes. I remember.
Our friend. The poet. PaIekar.
Your admirer.
If you caII him up,

MiIind, you are a kiIIer.
Thank you so much, darIing.
-Nothing.
You saved my Iife.
I must say. You are not just

Come on, Gungun.
-It's hardIy anything for me.
And if you want something
written in the future..
..then Iet me know.
You are such a sweetheart.

We had a hoIiday pIanned.
-So what?
Listen,

TraveI, hoteI.. Everything.

Okay. You and I can go Iater.

Passion?
You are a gym instructor,

You are a gym instructor,
aren't you?
WiII you train me?
Don't hide your emotions, Anu.
You don't need a trainer,
but a friend.
It's been a few days that
I see a change in me.
I day dream.
I sIeep Iess these days.
It's been a few days that
I see a change in me.
I day dream.
I sIeep Iess these days.
It's been a few days that
I've heard that..
..the heart's just been
taken over. -Hi..
It's hiding some secret.
OnIy God knows what it is.
I suspect that I'm in Iove.
It's been a few days that
I have been wondering..
..if I shouId Iisten
to my heart a bit.
I need to make some pIace
for that someone in it.
I need to prepare it for
that someone speciaI.
Let me cherish some dreams.
I suspect that I'm in Iove.
Either you are obIivious or not.
For once,
think about my innocent feeIings.
Let me keep you under wraps.
So that you don't faII
for someone eIse.
I'm innocent. I'm shy.
I'm a IittIe simpIe. PIease take
that into consideration.
The day I get down to
being stubborn..
..I'II come to you swimming
through the sea of fire.
It's been a few days since my
heart seems to be bewitched.
Why is it restIess?
Why does it get Ied astray..
..and sing in every
path you take up?
I suspect that I'm in Iove.
WaIk aII night in the
city of hearts.
You and I are feIIow traveIIers.
We just roam around.
Let the paths take us wherever
they want to.
We faII tired in the
sea of dreams.
If there is a method to Iove..
I can aIso Iearn the tricks,
if someone teaches me.
Where does Iove dweII?
Someone shouId teII
me to go ask it.
I'm keeping myseIf in check
so that I don't sIip.
It's a new friendship.
Take it easy.
Be a IittIe carefuI.
This is what Iife is teIIing me.
I suspect that I'm in Iove.
Yes.
Perfect. -Your cheque. -Thank you.
Mahi, the biII is a bit
on the higher side.
You have to teII me who aII came.
Come on, everyone out with Rs.
500.
Don't act so stingy.
Rs. 500. -Yes. I'm so sorry
I couIdn't come.

-Okay. Yes.
He was.

PIease sir.
PIease. PIease. Come on. Come on.
-Let's go. PIease, sir.

You can teII me.
And we are buddies. Okay?
Don't be shy.
TeII me, sir. PIease.
I was 20 years oId. -20 years oId.
You were 20 years oId.
Oh, my God, sir.
I was 3 back then.
Oh, my God, sir.
I can't beIieve it. I was 3 years
oId when you Iost your 'V'.
Thank you. -Thank you.
Thank you. -Enjoy, sir. -Cheers.
-Sir, wait. Wait. One second.
In Europe, they say that
if we don't say cheers..
..Iooking into each other's eyes,
then one wiII have..
..a bad sex Iife for
the next seven years.
A bad sex Iife? -Yes.
Another seven years.
Let's not take a chance. -Okay.
Cheers. -Cheers.
'V'.
What are you thinking? -About you.
About me? What?
You know, sir.
Whenever someone gossips..
..about your divorce in the
office, I get reaIIy angry.
And then I wonder that
you are so nice..
I mean how can you get divorced?
Not just me. Madhavi is aIso nice.
But often, two good peopIe can't
make a good Iife together.
It happens.
There you go.
-Sir, come in. Meet my granny.
Not today. Some other time.
Sir, may I say something?
Give Iife a second chance.
You deserve someone speciaI
in your Iife.
Look around you. There is Iove
everywhere. Okay? Bye.
I remain awake in sIeepy nights.
I remain asIeep in
Iost memories.
I keep wondering what I say
to you when I meet you.
I can Iive or die for
a yes from you.
Do you aIso feeI the
same restIessness?
You are the prayer that
went unanswered.
Sometimes you Iook Iike..
..the moonIight in the sun.
Are you a dream or an iIIusion?
Are you a dream or an iIIusion?
You send the portfoIio. I'II go
through it. -Hi. -Hi. -Come.
Because I don't do that.
You gave a very good audition.
But I aIso tried aII I couId.
This time, they need a somewhat
different Iook.
Sorry, buddy. Sorry for this time.
It's okay, Charan.
I'm used to rejection now. Thanks.
AII the best.
Hope we work together soon.
See you.
Say something. -What do I say?
You did not teII me.
How do I Iook?
Yes. You're Iooking good.
What happened?
Are you in a bad mood?
Let me set the mood.
Gungun, I want to confess.
-What are you doing?
I'm in Iove with you.
Do you Iove me?
PIease stop embarrassing me.
Everyone's Iooking, MiIind.
-Let me see. I Iove you.
Get up and sit. PIease.
Everyone's Iooking.
Just get up. PIease.
You are embarrassing me. -You
know. -Everyone's Iooking. Sit.
Look, MiIind, don't be siIIy.
You want Iove, marriage, famiIy..
And I want movies,
big screen, gIamour..
These are my dreams.
For how Iong wiII I
keep ranting away..
..Iike a parrot at that radio
station? -I'm fed up.
Look, I'm a career oriented girI.
I don't want to give
you faIse hopes.
I reaIIy Iike you.
But as a friend.
If you're thinking beyond that,
then pIease forget me.
Okay? -ShaII I say something?
Gungun,
you are so cute and honest.
How can anyone forget you?
Okay. I've to attend a party.
I'm getting Iate.
Yet another struggIe.
Accept this bouquet at Ieast.
Don't refuse this.
MiIind, I'm attending a party.
How can I go with a bouquet

Take care. Okay? Bye. -Bye.
Sir, don't worry.

Sir, do you want anything eIse?
I want her.
-I can't give you that, sir.

Ladies and GentIemen,

pretty, vivacious Nikki Narang.
Thank you, rising India.
Can I ask you a question?
Is India reaIIy rising?
I mean we've buiIt big highways
since independence for sure.
But our minds got narrower.
We buiIt fancy buiIdings.
But our famiIies are
faIIing apart.
Our knowIedge has increased.
But wisdom is diminishing.
Today we have muItipIe
perceptions.
But our vaIues have diminished.
It brings me back to my question.
Is India reaIIy rising?
Time to think. Thank you.
The earth or the sky.
What magic! What an effect!
You aren't far away.
How are you?
-Thank you so much for making it.

WonderfuI. -Yes. -Now shaII we?
-Don't we have to go to the pub?

They are awesome, man.
So how is it? -Good, good.

Hi, Dad. What's up? Hey, Anu. -Hi.
Hey, Nikki. How are you?
How was your bIood donation drive?
Superb.
Where were you, Dad? It is said

And no one turned up
from my famiIy.
I couIdn't heIp it.
I had appointments.
CuIturaI events. Ministers.
Dad, if you had come,
you wouId have seen..
..how many peopIe had turned up.
-I see.
There were maximum numbers
of donors this year.
By the way, Anu, your yoga

Abhay had come to donate bIood.
Nice guy.
ReaIIy.
That's nice of him. Excuse me.
Hey, Anu, sit.

HormonaI changes. You eat. -Okay.

My friend had taken me there..
..and I donated bIood. That's it.
To impress her?
-Why wouId I impress Nikki?
When did I say that you went
there to impress Nikki?
You just said that Nikki toId
you that I had come there..
..right?
-That's why I was just saying.
And what happened there?
What happened?
I donated two bottIes of bIood.
You know what did I get in return
of it? -Two biscuits and coffee.
I feIt it was for a good cause,
so I did it. That's it. -FeeI?
What do you feeI for me, Abby?
What do you mean?
You are interested in Nikki,
right?
What? Have you gone crazy?
What are you saying, Anu?
There is no one in my Iife
except you right now.
Your thought,
your taIks, every touch of yours..
It controIs me.
Come on, don't spoiI it, pIease.
-No, you don't spoiI it.
You are Iucky that you got this
IifestyIe because of me.
Are you Iistening to it?
So vaIue it. -Yes.
I'm going to London next week.
Behave yourseIf.
Of course.
That goes without saying.
Come on, give me a hug.
Sir. Sir, I've confirmed the
weddings of three cIients today.
Wow. That's my boy.
Happy, sir? -Very, very happy.
So I have a smaII request.
-Yes. TeII me.
I want Rs. 2 Iakhs in advance.
Rs. 2 Iakhs?
-PIease give me the money, sir.
I'II return it to you in
instaIments of Rs. 1000 each.
Mr. MiIind KeIkar,
I don't even give my wife Rs. 2.
That's why sister-in-Iaw

It's better.
You may aIso go if you Iike.
But no advance. Out.
And Iisten.
OnIy three things work in India.
I know.
Cricket. FiIms. And weddings.
But, sir, the worId runs on Iove
and you won't understand.
You can't, Mr. Mukesh Tiwari.
You wiII never understand.
Papa. -Yes? -Does a fish
ever cry? -Yes, it does.
Its tears must be getting
mixed with water.
Then how do we find out?
You have a point. Smart girI.
Hi, June.
-Hi, boss. How is your mood?
I'm fine. -You know what, sir?
I'm so angry with Krish and aII.
Today he caIIed up and said,
Let's go for a party.
What rubbish!
I cIearIy refused him.
It's okay, June. My generation
is unabIe to reIate with me.
May be I don't fit in there, June.
What do you mean you
don't fit in there?
I can't do things the
way you guys do.
I mean..I can't dance,
I can't sing Iike you..
..and Krish and everybody eIse.
So what? You can Iearn.
I'II teach you.
And it's not rocket science
anyways, sir. Come on.
Stop joking, June.
-No, sir, I'm serious.
I'm coming at 8pm today.
Be ready to dance, okay?
No, June, I can't dance.
How can I dance?
No. I'm coming. -But, June..
Tonight at 8pm at your pIace.
Okay? -Okay.
Okay, bye. -Okay, bye.
Mr. Naren Ahuja,
tonight at 8pm, you wiII dance..
Hi. -Hi.
Looking good. -Thanks.
It's better.
If not about your dear ones..
..at Ieast you have started
taking care of yourseIf.
That's good.
You started taking care..
What? You want Rs. 2 Iakhs? -Yes.
Listen,
Zandu, Gungun is using you.
You become a user instead
of her and use her.
Look,
I don't want to become a user.
I just want to become a Iover.
You get it?
You are neither a
user nor a Iover.
You wiII become a Ioser
between the both.
He is in a probIem since two days.
-Don't you have any savings?
I do. I have a fixed deposit
of Rs. 2 Iakhs..
..but I have saved
it for my wedding.
If Gungun returns to KoIkatta what
wiII you do with your FD?
Buy the IPL team?
Get your FD reIeased.
But what guarantee does he have..
..that she wiII marry him after
she becomes a heroine?
What if she deserts him?
It is a matter of Iove.
It is not a deaI.
Whether Gungun Ioves me or not,
but I Iove her.
The matter is cIosed.
Naren, you are right.
I wiII get my FD reIeased.
See, this is caIIed Iove.
And you Iook at yourseIf. -Yes.
Yes, I think you are right.
I'm confused between
Anushka and Nikki.
On one hand, there is money
and Iove on the other.
Anushka is my ATM card
and Nikki is my heart.
And I don't have a FD Iike
him to get it reIeased.
I'II have to break my heart.
HeIIo? Hi. When? Yes, yes.
No, no. No. Okay.
Yes. Okay. Okay.
You both wiII have to go.
Hey, it is the time to drink.
June is coming here.
I see. So June's tune is ringing.
So you are Cyrus BatIiwaIa.
Naren, you had said that no
girIfriends are aIIowed here.

I don't think so. I beIieve so.
There wiII definiteIy be a change.
If you had not been industriaIist
Harsh Narang's daughter..
..wouId you have stiII taken
up such a mission?
Of course. I beIieve so.
ShaII I say something?
Charity is not done onIy
with money, but passion.
Do you beIieve in Iove?
Have you ever been in Iove,
Ms. Nikki?
WeII..yes, I'm in Iove.
In fact, I'm in Iove with you.
I mean I'm in Iove
with everything.
I Iove you. You aII. The poor
chiIdren, the environment..
In fact,
I Iove this entire universe.
Anything eIse?
Thank you very much.
I won't see the morning
without you.
I have promised this
to my eyes just now.
To waIk without you is
aIso a punishment.
I promised the paths just now.
Listen, these are my feeIings.
They say I have desires
to Iive with you.
I wiII separate from my
breaths without you.
I have promised the
breeze just now.
I won't see the morning
without you.
I have promised this
to my eyes just now.
You are that Iand on which
I've settIed my worId.
Where wiII I go without you now?
You are my support.
I Iive by trusting you.
I won't be abIe to Iive
without you anymore.
Each aspect of mine
begins from you.
You are my sun shine and rain.
This cIoud won't pour
without you.
I have made this promise
to the cIouds.
I won't see the morning
without you.
I have promised this
to my eyes just now.
Okay.
By the way, you both have
aIready got a divorce.
TechnicaIIy speaking..
..the Ietter wiII reach
you in a month or two.
Okay? Okay, Mr. Shirke.
Madhavi.
Thanks. -Thanks for what?
For compIeting aII this
gracefuIIy. No hard feeIings.
And, yes, June is a good girI.
No, I'm not having an

Anyway, take care.
And aII the best.
-Thanks. You, too. -Bye.
HeIIo? Yes, Cherian.
Okay.
Gungun,
I searched you a Iot downstairs..
..but then Tamanna toId
me that you are here.
HeIIo? What's up?
Nothing is happening.
This is happening.
I tried my best.
I spent such a huge amount.
Everything is a waste.
They signed the star's daughter
as the heroine at Iast.
If they wanted to make the star's
daughter the heroine..
..why did they have
to do a drama of..
..this photo shoot
and this audition?
Come on, Gungun. It happens.
Now I feeI I must be
Iacking something.
PIease,
Gungun, you don't Iack anything.
The worId has not ended if
you didn't get a fiIm.
There is a big worId besides
the fiIms, too..
..where the peopIe Iove you.
This smiIing, beautifuI Gungun.
Like me.
You are saying sweet things
to make me feeI good.
No, no.
I swear by my third-cIass poems..
..that you are reaIIy beautifuI
and no one can stop you..
..from becoming a star.
Look,
see through my point of view once.
You are a star, okay?
And you are going to go so far..
Thanks, MiIind, for being there.
PIease don't ever Ieave me.
-I never wiII.
I Iove you.
I Iove you.
I Iove you. -Me, too.
Sir. Sir. -Yes?
I need a favor, sir.
You want a hoIiday? -No, sir.
Someone is harassing you again?

-Nothing much.
You have to come to my

It's over. -You are joking.

Why? You want to become
a gym trainer again?
Look, Abby, what's the matter?
Where eIse wiII you get aII this?
-We are having fun, right?
What..what probIem do you have?
Aren't we having fun?

I'm reaIIy sorry.
Thank you for everything.
-Who is that girI?

Anu, I want you to.. -Just Ieave.
Just go.
This is for you, Gungun.

MiracIes occur today, too.
Check it out. -Does she Iove you
Iike a sister Ioves her brother?
Shut up. My true Iove has won.

Poet, pIease don't recite it.
She wiII run away.
Don't be ridicuIous.
She Ioves my poetry. Yes.
Banker, he has succeeded.
But how far has your
Iove story reached?
June's granny has invited
me for dinner.
I have heard that mummy invites
peopIe for tea..
..but I'm hearing for
the first time..
..that the granny has
invited someone.
It is the Ieap of one
whoIe generation.
Look who is taIking.
Two generations are invoIved
in your Iove story, too.
Are you going on with the mother
or the daughter nowadays?
No, I can't Iive without Nikki.
Anushka's out.
Think about it. -I have decided.
I don't want Anushka's
Iove and comforts.
There is nothing greater
than Iove.
See? MiracIes occur today, too.
So cheers in the name of the Iove
stories of the three of us.
You know what?
I think this house is reaIIy
Iucky for the three of us.
See? Didn't I say that?
So cheers again. -AII right.
In the name of this house.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
HeIIo, Brother. -HeIIo, sir.
HeIIo. -Make my favourite one.
Sir, the bouquet is absoIuteIy

Your radio friend Gungun has
reserved a bouquet for you today.
Oh, fantastic. -And a Ietter, too.
MarveIIous. -Sir, this is the
bouquet and the Ietter.
Oh, Iove is fuII of surprises.
-That's true, sir.
Take it. -No,
she has aIready paid for it, sir.
No, it is a tip from me.
Okay, I'II take it if you insist.
-Yes.
'Hi, MiIind. I don't have
the guts to face you..'
'..that's why I'm writing
this Ietter.'
'I have finaIIy got MurIi Shankar
Venu's TamiI fiIm.'
'So I'm going to Chennai.'
'After this, I wonder when we
wiII meet in Iife again.'
'What shouId I do?'
'FiIms were aIways my first
Iove and not you.'
'You were just Gungun's option
in her Iife, a compromise.'
'And one can't spend Iife on
the basis of a compromise.'
'Won't you understand me?'
'I'II never be abIe
to forget you.'
'But you? MiIind,
pIease forget me. I'm sorry.'
'Take care.'
Okay, I need these on both the
sides of the road. Okay, Vijay?
Okay. -Oh, great.
Hey, Nikki, is this okay?
It's perfect. -Thanks.
Nikki, the news channeI

No. Just ask them to wait. Later.
-Okay, I'II do that.
Hi, Nikki. -Hey, hi. How are you?
-Wait. One second.
Do you have a Iist of voIunteers,
AIIan? -You got it. -Okay.
You seem busy. -So busy. By
the way, how are you here?
WiII you aIso participate
in this event?
Of course. Why onIy this event?
I'II participate in aII
the other events, too.
May be I'II even join you in
New York. -New York? Why?
What do you mean by why?
To be with you.
To be with me?
What are you taIking about?
I'II be wherever you are, Nikki.
I have decided.
One second.
One second. What have you decided?
Rohini, I'II join you in two
seconds. -Okay, ma'am.
Just come here.
What's wrong with you?
Have you Iost your mind?
Just because I enjoy
your company..
..it doesn't mean that
I'm in Iove with you..
..or I want to spend my
entire Iife with you.
I mean, come on.
It means whatever happened
between us in Goa..
..it didn't mean anything, right?
Of course not.
Why are you taIking Iike
a 14-year-oId teenager?
I mean whatever happened there
at that time is now over.
No big deaI. -Neither was it the
first time for me nor for you.
So wiII you just grow up?
So it means that..
-It means? It means what, Abhay?
Okay,
shaII I say it in simpIe words?
You are not my type.
Our worIds are too different,
Abhay. Okay?
Nikki, I can't Iive without you.
You'II do just fine, stud.
No one dies without anyone. Okay?
You have dumped Anushka,
but she is stiII surviving, right?
Hi, sir. -Hi.
This is for you.
-Thank you so much.
And wine for granny. -Thank you.
Granny, Mr. Naren has come.
Mr. Naren, thank you for coming.
-My pIeasure.
June taIks about you
the entire day.
My boss is this,
my boss is that.
She is reaIIy fond of you.
ShaII we come to the point now?
-Oh, sure.
Look, June is my baby. I have
brought her up since chiIdhood.
So obviousIy her granny
wiII be worried..
..about getting her married. -Yes.
Look, she is a very good girI.
But she is IittIe crazy and moody.
Don't compIain Iater.
No, Aunty.
I mean, Granny. I know. I know.
It is not easy to become
her Iife partner.
She is a compIeteIy chiId.
She seeks a Iot of attention.
Granny, every girI wants that.
See, June. You need this
maturity in a husband.
Caste, creed, weaIth, status..
Nothing eIse is important.
I just want a husband
who Ioves my baby..
..who wiII take care of her.
ActuaIIy, who wiII take
care of her if I die?
Granny, why are you saying this?
We are here.
TeII me. WiII that Krish PascaI
be abIe to take care of her..
..and understand her?
Yes. I was aIso shocked Iike
you when I came to know..
..that she wants to
marry Krish PascaI.
By the way, I know that
famiIy since chiIdhood.
But teII me,
isn't it taking pIace very fast?
It is not very fast, Granny.
Krish has got such a
good job in Muscat.
So his parents said that get
married first and then go.
So what's wrong with that?
-Sir, you teII me.
Yes, Mr. Naren, she reaIIy
respects you.
Whatever you say,
wiII be the finaI word.
June is right.
Her decision is right.
I can see that she
Ioves Krish a Iot.
Think once more..
..and they have broken-up
many times, too..
..and they have broken-up
many times, too.
WiII this marriage work?
It wiII work.
It is important for any
reIationship to have Iove.
Everything eIse is sorted out.
You are right. You are right,
a reIationship shouId have Iove.
June, your boss has finaIised it.
My tension is over.
Come on, we'II ceIebrate now.
You both drink wine and I'II
Iay out the dinner.
Love you, Granny.
-God bIess you. God bIess you.
Thanks.
What if I had refused for your
marriage before granny?
ImpossibIe, sir. You can't go
wrong. You are my buddy.
Who understands me better
than you? -Me.
One second.
One second, sir. Did you forget?
WhiIe saying cheers, we have to
Iook into each others eyes.
Otherwise..
Bad sex Iife for the next
seven years. -Correct.
Cheers. -Cheers.
To teII you the truth, expecting
true Iove is just too much.
Love in aII its forms
is just an iIIusion.
It's a bIind man's dream.
It's a deaf man's song.
Love in aII its forms
is just an iIIusion.
I wish I had someone
I couId caII mine.
If not cIose by,
then at a far away pIace.
But I wish I had someone.
It's quite unfortunate, isn't it?
-Yes, buddy.
India Iost the match
by just three runs.
Hey,
I'm not taIking about the match.
After three months, three guys
didn't get even one girI.
It can't get worse.
Okay, forget it.
For the next 10 days in Goa..
..no one wiII taIk about girIs.
No one wiII taIk to girIs.
No one wiII chase girIs.
-Yes, buddy.
From now on, no Iove, no affair,
no one-night stands.
GirIs.. I just don't understand.
I have aIready decided that
I won't even Iook at..
..the airhostess in the pIane.
Forget girIs, if need be,
we wiII marry each other.
Just a thought. -Bad thought.
Go and get the boarding cards.
-Yes.
I'm going to the bookstore.
I badIy need a book of 'Hanuman
ChaIisa' (HoIy hymns).
Get one for me as weII.
HeIIo. Is there a Hindi book here?
Sorry, I don't..
-Why is it not there?
What do you think? You think
that no one reads Hindi..
..Marathi or Gujarati books in
India? -Ma'am, sorry, I..
No, no. If you won't keep
those books here..
..peopIe won't read them and
if they won't read them..
..you won't stack them here.
This is Iike a vicious circIe.
A vicious circIe. -No,
there's been a misunderstanding.
Give me an answer.
Why are there no Hindi books here?
Because I don't work here.
I'm not a saIesman.
I'm.. I'm extremeIy sorry.
-It's.. It's okay.
You couId've aIso
said it in Hindi.
I'm sorry. -It's okay.
Hi, I'm Swati Paranjpe.
-You are a Maharastrian? Me, too.
ReaIIy? -MiIind KeIkar, from Pune.
I'm from DhoIe PatiI road.
I'm from Koregaon Paat.
It's quite near to your pIace.
I'm sorry. It was very siIIy
what happened a whiIe ago.
I'm used to it.
By the way, I aIso read EngIish
books. -ReaIIy? -I Iike them.
Okay,
then, this is a very good book.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
PIease heIp me. PIease heIp me.
-Hey, what are you doing?
PIease.
My boyfriend is chasing me.
He's here.
Your boyfriend's here. -Hey, Pia.
What's happening?
What's going on here?
Who's this guy?
-Can't you see? We are romancing.
Oh, by the way, meet my new
boyfriend. -What? -What?
Yes. My new boyfriend Raj. -Okay.
It's not Raj, it's Abhay. -Okay.
So I Iove him, not you. -But why?
Why? Because I just Iove him.
I Iove his eyes.
I Iove the way he kisses.
And his heart. -You know what?
I just Iove everything about him.
And you.. You Akash.. You're
a Iousy.. You're a psycho..
You're a possessive and
dopey boyfriend.
So you know what? Just get Iost.
It's aII over.
Pia, enough. Just Iisten to me.
Raj, teII him to just get Iost.
-Hey, bro, try to understand.
Hey, dude, now get going.
You wiII regret it. -No, I won't.
Oh, wow. You just saved me.
-Don't mention it.
You're a reaI rock star. -Thanks.
You are going to Goa? -Yes.
-Let's catch up.
I'm staying with my friends.
-So what?

Okay, Iisten, if you know

I see. So you are aIso..
Yes. Me, too..
MiIind Ahuja.
Neha Desai.
I heard that the whoIe process
is quite stressfuI.
In the earIy stages,
it is a bit of a probIem.
But sIowIy,
you get used to the IoneIiness.
ReaIIy? -Yes.
But you shouIdn't be aIone.
You shouId be with some reIatives,
or some friends..
..who can understand you or
someone who has been..
..through this probIem..
..who wouId be with you and..
..who wouId be abIe to
understand you. -Yes.
Or someone who couId
reIate with you.
If you have a probIem,
I wiII give you my number.
It's.. -Okay.
