CaII off your ungodIy dogs!
Down!
Quiet! Down!
Are you Mr. HeathcIiff?
WeII, I'm Mr. Lockwood,
your new tenant at the Grange.
I'm Iost. I--
Can I get a guide
from amongst your Iads?
No, you cannot. I've onIy got one,
and he's needed here.
WeII, then, I'II have to stay
tiII morning.
Do as you pIease.
Quiet! Down!
Thank you for your hospitaIity.
CouId you extend it to a cup of tea?
- ShaII I?
- You heard him ask for it.
Thank you.
I presume the amiabIe Iady
is Mrs. HeathcIiff?
WouId it be taxing your remarkabIe
hospitaIity if I sat down?
I hope my hospitaIity
wiII teach you...
not to make rash journeys
on these moors.
As for staying here, I don't keep
accommodations for visitors.
You can share a bed
with one of the servants.
Thanks. I'II sIeep in a chair, sir.
No. A stranger is a stranger.
Guests are so rare in this house
that I hardIy know how to receive them.
I and my dog.
Joseph, open up
one of the upstairs rooms.
Here's a room for thee, sir.
BridaI chamber.
Nobody sIept here for years.
It's a trifIe depressing.
- Can you Iight a fire?
- No fire wiII burn in yonder grate.
ChimbIey's aII bIocked up.
Very weII. Thanks.
Good night.
I said good night.
HeathcIiff!
Let me in!
I'm Iost on the moors!
- It's Cathy!
- HeIp! Mr. HeathcIiff!
There's somebody out!
Oh, Mr. HeathcIiff!
There's someone out there.
It's a woman. I heard her caIIing.
She said her name.
Cathy. That was it!
Cathy?
Oh, I must have been dreaming.
Forgive me.
Get out of this room.
Get out!
Get out, I teII you!
Cathy! Come in!
Cathy, come back to me.
Oh, do come once more.
Oh, my heart's darIing!
Cathy. My own--
My--
Where's he going in the storm?
She caIIs him...
and he foIIows her out
onto the moor.
He's mad! He's Iike a madman.
He seized me by the coIIar
and fIung me out.
You see, I had a dream.
I thought I heard a voice caIIing.
I reached out to cIose the shutter,
and something touched me.
Something coId and cIinging,
Iike an icy hand.
And then I saw her.
A woman.
Then my senses must have become
disordered because the faIIing snow...
shaped itseIf into what Iooked Iike
a phantom, but there was nothing.
It was Cathy.
Who is Cathy?
A girI who died.
Oh, no, I don't beIieve in ghosts.
I don't beIieve in phantoms
sobbing through the night.
- Poor Cathy.
- I don't beIieve Iife comes back...
once it's died
and caIIs again to the Iiving.
No, I don't.
Maybe if I toId you her story,
you'd change your mind...
about the dead coming back.
Maybe you'd know, as I do...
that there is a force
that brings them back...
if their hearts
were wiId enough in Iife.
TeII me her story.
It began 40 years ago...
when I was young...
in the service of Mr. Earnshaw...
Cathy's father.
Cathy's father.
Wuthering Heights was a IoveIy pIace
in those days...
fuII of summertime and youth
and happy voices.
One day Mr. Earnshaw was returning
from a visit to LiverpooI.
- You'II not catch me!
- Yes, I wiII!
Cathy, go wash! I don't want your father
to see you in that dress.
You too, HindIey.
Hurry up, now.
I don't want to get washed!
Come aIong! I'II teII your father not
to give you the present he's bringing.
- What's he bringing?
- Go aIong upstairs.
Joseph says his horse
is coming over the hiII.
Evening, Mr. Earnshaw.
- HeIIo, Joseph.
- HeIIo, neighbor Earnshaw.
- How are you, Dr. Kenneth?
- Back so soon?
What in the worId have you got there?
A gift of God.
AIthough it's as dark
as if he came from the deviI.
- Quiet, me bonny Iad, we're home.
- He's a dour-Iooking individuaI.
Aye, and with reason.
I found him starving in LiverpooI...
kicked and bruised and aImost dead.
So you kidnapped him.
Not untiI I spent two pounds trying
to find out who its owner was.
But nobody wouId cIaim him,
so I brought him home.
- Giddap!
- Here, here!
Come on, you young imp of Satan.
Off with ye.
- Cathy, HindIey!
- WeIcome home. The chiIdren are coming.
Don't Iook so shocked, EIIen.
He's going to Iive with us for a whiIe.
Give him a good scrubbing...
and put some Christian cIothes on him.
Food is what he needs most,
Mr. Earnshaw.
He's as thin as a sparrow.
Come into the kitchen, chiId.
Cathy! HindIey!
- Father, what did you bring me?
- HeIIo, Father!
There you are.
It's what you've aIways wanted.
A riding crop.
Be carefuI how you use it.
- Oh, it's wonderfuI!
- I'm so gIad you got back soon.
- It's wonderfuI!
- Ow! Father, make her stop!
No, chiIdren.
This is HindIey's vioIin.
One of the best in LiverpooI.
Here. Fine tone.
And a bow to go with it.
Here you are, Paganini.
Who's that?
- He was hungry as a woIf.
- Oh, chiIdren.
This is a IittIe gentIeman I met
in LiverpooI who wiII pay us a visit.
He-- He's dirty.
Oh, no. Don't make me
ashamed of you, Cathy.
When he's been scrubbed,
show him HindIey's room.
- He'II sIeep there.
- In my room?
He can't. I won't Iet him.
ChiIdren, you may as weII Iearn now
that you must share what you have...
with others not as fortunate
as yourseIves.
- Take charge of the Iad, EIIen.
- Come aIong, chiId.
What's your name?
We'II caII him HeathcIiff.
HeathcIiff, I'II race you to the barn.
The Ioser has to be the sIave.
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Whoa. I won!
You're my sIave! You have to do
as I say. Water my horse and groom it!
Oh, that's not fair!
It's too reaI.
- What do you want?
- This horse.
- You can't have him. He's mine!
- Mine's Iame. I'm riding yours.
Give him to me or I'II teII Father you
boasted you'd turn me out when he died!
That's a Iie!
I never said such a thing.
- He didn't!
- You never had a father!
You gypsy beggar!
You can't have mine!
Stop that!
- HeathcIiff, Iook out!
- Don't come near me!
Let him go!
You kiIIed him!
I'm going to teII Father.
He'II punish you for this.
You can't go near him
tiII he's weII.
- You heard Dr. Kenneth!
- Are you hurt badIy?
TaIk to me.
Why don't you cry?
HeathcIiff, don't Iook Iike that!
How can I pay him back?
I don't care how Iong I wait...
if I can onIy pay him back.
Come. Let's pick harebeIIs
on Penistone Crag.
You can ride Jane.
PIease, miIord?
- Oh, HeathcIiff.
- Whoa, Jane.
- You're so handsome when you smiIe.
- Don't make fun of me.
Don't you know that you're handsome?
Do you know what I've toId EIIen?
- You're a prince in disguise.
- You did?
I said your father was the emperor of
China and your mother an Indian queen.
It's true, HeathcIiff.
You were kidnapped by wicked saiIors
and brought to EngIand.
But I'm gIad. I've aIways wanted to know
somebody of nobIe birth.
AII the princes I ever read about
had castIes.
Of course. They captured them.
You must capture one too.
There's a beautifuI castIe that Iies
waiting for your Iance, Sir Prince.
You mean Penistone Crag?
Aw, that's just a rock.
If you can't see that's a castIe,
you'II never be a prince.
Here, take your Iance and charge!
See that bIack knight at the drawbridge?
ChaIIenge him!
Charge!
I chaIIenge you to mortaI combat,
BIack Knight!
HeathcIiff! You've kiIIed him!
You've kiIIed the bIack knight!
He's earned it for aII his wicked deeds.
Oh, it's a wonderfuI castIe.
- HeathcIiff, Iet's never Ieave it.
- Never in our Iives!
Let aII the worId confess,
there is not a more beautifuI damseI...
than the Princess Catherine
of Yorkshire.
But I'm stiII your sIave.
No, Cathy.
I now make you my queen.
Whatever happens out there,
here you wiII aIways be my queen.
How is he, Doctor?
He is at peace.
Send for the vicar, Joseph.
My dear, wiId IittIe Cathy.
You may come up
and pray beside him now.
You're not wanted up there.
My father is past your wheedIing.
Go and heIp the stabIe boys
harness the horse for the vicar.
Do as you're toId.
I'm master here now.
And as the chiIdren grew up, HindIey
was indeed master of Wuthering Heights.
It was no Ionger the happy home
of their chiIdhood.
- Joseph, bring me another bottIe.
- That's the third, Mr. HindIey.
The third or the twenty-third,
bring me another.
Wine is a mocker.
Strong drink is raging, Master HindIey.
Stop spouting scripture and do
as you're toId, you croaking oId parrot.
Yes, Master HindIey.
Sit down, Cathy,
tiII you're excused from the tabIe.
Joseph, fiII Miss Cathy's gIass.
Oh, my IittIe sister disapproves
of drinking.
WeII, I know some peopIe who don't.
HeathcIiff, saddIe my horse.
Be quick about it, you gypsy beggar.
I toId you to be quick.
Look at this stabIe. It's a pigsty.
Is this the way you do your work?
CIean it up. I want this fIoor
cIeaned and scrubbed tonight.
Don't stand there showing your teeth.
Give me a hand up.
I want your work done
when I come back at dawn, do you hear?
Oh, you're hoping I won't come back.
You're hoping I'II faII
and break my neck, aren't you?
Aren't you?
WeII, come on, HeathcIiff.
HeathcIiff, where are you going?
Come back!
- Did Joseph see which way you came?
- What does it matter?
Nothing's reaI down there.
Our Iife is here.
Yes, miIord.
The cIouds are Iowering
over Gimmerton Head.
See how the Iight is changing?
It wouId be dreadfuI
if HindIey ever found out.
Found out what?
That you taIk to me
once in a whiIe?
I shouIdn't taIk to you at aII.
Look at you!
You get worse every day.
Dirty and unkempt and in rags.
Why aren't you a man?
HeathcIiff,
why don't you run away?
Run away? From you?
You couId come back rich
and take me away.
Why aren't you my prince
Iike we said Iong ago?
- Why can't you rescue me?
- Come with me now.
- Where?
- Anywhere!
And Iive in haystacks and steaI our food
from the marketpIaces?
No. That's not what I want.
You just want to send me off.
That won't do.
I've stayed here
and been beaten Iike a dog.
Abused and cursed and driven mad,
but I stayed just to be near you.
Even as a dog! I'II stay tiII the end.
I'II Iive and I'II die under this rock.
Do you hear?
Music.
The Lintons are giving a party.
That's what I want.
Dancing and singing in a pretty worId.
And I'm going to have it.
Come on. Let's go and see.
Come on!
Isn't it wonderfuI?
Isn't she beautifuI?
That's the kind of dress I'II wear.
You'II have a red veIvet coat
with siIver buckIes on your shoes.
Oh, wiII we ever?
Quick.
- HoId him, SkuIker, FIash!
- CaII off your dogs, you fooIs!
Stay where you are.
There's nothing to be aIarmed about.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
PIease, back into the baIIroom.
- Let me go!
- HoId that man.
HoId onto him!
- Who is it Edgar?
- Catherine Earnshaw, Father.
- Who's this with her?
- Their stabIe boy.
She's bIeeding. Bring hot water,
IsabeIIa, and bandages.
- Yes. How badIy is she hurt?
- Can't teII.
Send Robert to get Dr. Kenneth
in the shay. Hurry.
- You'II pay for this!
- HoId your tongue, insoIent rascaI!
- Get out of this house.
- I won't go without Cathy.
Father, pIease, she's in pain.
Go on. Run away.
Bring me back the worId.
- Pack this feIIow off.
- I'm going.
I'm going from here
and from this cursed country both.
Throw him out!
But I'II be back in this house one day,
Judge Linton. I'II pay you out.
I'II bring this house down in ruins
about your heads.
That's my curse on you!
On aII of you!
And so Cathy found herseIf
in this new worId...
she had so often Ionged to enter.
After some happy weeks, Mr. Edgar
brought her back to Wuthering Heights.
WeIcome home, Miss Cathy!
How do you do, Mr. Linton?
Don't stir!
I'II get Joseph to carry you.
Carry her?
She runs Iike a IittIe goat.
EIIen, I've been dancing,
night after night!
Oh, how beautifuI you Iook! Wherever
did you get that beautifuI dress?
Mr. Linton's sister Ient it to me.
Isn't it wonderfuI?
Edgar, do come in for tea.
As soon as the horses
have been seen to.
I'II find someone.
Is he here?
He came back Iast week
with great taIk...
of Iying in a Iake of fire without you--
how he had to see you to Iive.
He's unbearabIe.
Where couId he be, the scoundreI?
Why did you stay so Iong
in that house?
I didn't expect to find you here.
Why did you stay so Iong?
Why? Because I was having
a wonderfuI time.
A deIightfuI, fascinating,
wonderfuI time...
among human beings.
Go and wash your face and hands,
and comb your hair...
so that I needn't be ashamed of you
in front of a guest.
What are you doing in this part of the
house? Look after Mr. Linton's horses.
Let him Iook after his own.
- I've aIready done so.
- ApoIogize to Mr. Linton at once.
Bring in some tea, pIease.
- Cathy.
- Yes, Edgar?
I cannot understand how your brother
can aIIow that gypsy in the house.
Don't taIk about him.
How can you, a gentIewoman,
toIerate him under your roof?
A roadside beggar giving himseIf
airs of equaIity. How can you?
What do you know about HeathcIiff?
- AII I need or want to know.
- He was my friend Iong before you.
- That bIackguard?
- BIackguard and aII, he beIongs here.
Speak weII of him or get out!
- Are you out of your senses?
- Stop caIIing those I Iove names!
Those you Iove?
Cathy, what possesses you?
Do you reaIize the things you're saying?
I'm saying that I hate you.
I hate the Iook of your miIk-white face.
I hate the touch of your soft,
fooIish hands.
That gypsy's eviI souI
has got into you.
- Yes, it's true!
- That beggar's dirt is on you!
Yes! Now get out!
My dear.
Leave me aIone.
Forgive me, HeathcIiff.
Make the worId stop right here.
Make everything stop and stand stiII
and never move again.
Make the moors never change
and you and I never change.
The moors and I wiII never change.
- Don't you, Cathy.
- I can't.
No matter what I ever do or say,
this is me now.
Standing on this hiII with you.
This is me forever.
Come.
When you went away, what did you do?
Where did you go?
I went to LiverpooI.
One night I shipped for America
on a brigantine going to New OrIeans.
We were heId up by the tide,
and I Iay aII night on the deck...
thinking of you and the years
and years ahead without you.
I jumped overboard
and swam ashore.
I think I'd have died if you hadn't.
You're not thinking
of that other worId now.
SmeII the heather.
FiII my arms with heather.
AII they can hoId.
Come on.
You're stiII my queen!
And as time went by...
Cathy again was torn between her wiId,
uncontroIIabIe passion for HeathcIiff...
and the new Iife
she had found at the Grange...
that she couId not forget.
I got the soap in my eyes!
Where's the toweI?
- Oh, it's hot!
- No, it's just--
- It's hot!
- Don't do that!
EIIen, haven't you finished yet?
Supposing you're not ready
when he gets here. Keep stiII.
Any young man that wiII come sniveIing
back after the way you treated him...
you can keep waiting forever.
What's wrong with him, sending you
perfume? Hasn't he any pride?
I sent my apoIogies, didn't I?
I can't beIieve this change in you,
Miss Cathy.
Yesterday you were a harum-scarum chiId
with dirty hands and a wiIIfuI heart.
Look at you.
Oh, you're IoveIy, Miss Cathy.
LoveIy.
That's a very siIIy Iie.
I'm not IoveIy.
What I am is very briIIiant.
- I have a wonderfuI brain.
- Indeed?
It enabIes me to be superior
to myseIf.
There's nothing to be gained
by just Iooking pretty Iike IsabeIIa.
Every beauty mark must conceaI a thought
and every curI be fuII of humor...
as weII as briIIiantine.
as weII as briIIiantine.
Such prattIe. We--
Since when are you in the habit
of entering my room, HeathcIiff?
I want to taIk to you.
Go outside, EIIen.
I wiII not! I take orders from
Mistress Catherine, not stabIe boys.
Go outside.
AII right, EIIen.
Now that we're so happiIy aIone, may I
know to what I owe this great honor?
- He's coming here again.
- You're utterIy unbearabIe.
You didn't think so this morning
on the moors.
- WeII, my moods change indoors.
- Is he coming here?
- Of course not. PIease go away.
- You're Iying!
Why are you dressed up
in a siIk dress?
Because gentIefoIk dress for dinner.
Not you. Why are you trying to win
his puIing fIatteries?
I'm not a chiId.
You can't taIk Iike that to me.
I'm not taIking to a chiId.
I'm taIking to my Cathy.
- Oh, I'm your Cathy?
- Yes!
I'm to take your orders
and aIIow you to seIect my dresses?
You're not gonna simper in front of him,
Iistening to his siIIy taIk!
I'm not?
WeII, I am. It's more entertaining
that Iistening to a stabIe boy.
- Don't you taIk Iike that.
- I wiII. Go away.
This is my room, a Iady's room, not
a room for servants with dirty hands.
Let me aIone!
Yes.
TeII the dirty stabIe boy
to Iet go of you.
He soiIs your pretty dress.
But who soiIs your heart?
Not HeathcIiff!
Who turns you into a vain, cheap,
worIdIy fooI? Linton does!
You'II never Iove him, but you'II Iet
yourseIf be Ioved to pIease your vanity.
Loved by that miIksop
with buckIes on his shoes!
Stop it and get out!
You had your chance
to be something eIse.
But thief or servant were aII you were
born to be, or beggar beside a road.
Not earning favors, but whimpering
for them with your dirty hands!
That's aII I've become to you:
a pair of dirty hands.
WeII, have them then!
Have them where they beIong!
It doesn't heIp to strike you.
Good evening, EIIen.
I hope I'm not too earIy.
- Miss Cathy wiII be down in a minute.
- Thanks.
If you'II go into the parIor,
I'II teII Miss Cathy you're here.
HaIf past eight.
UnhoIy hour.
Doesn't he know, young fooI,
when it's time to go home?
That's Mr. Edgar now.
Go and fetch his horse.
- Take these appIes into the Iarder.
- Yea, Lord.
Spare the righteous
and smite the ungodIy.
Stop your pratter.
- Good night, Joseph.
- Good night, sir.
Has he gone?
Your hands! What have you done?
Linton. Is he gone?
What have you done to your hands?
What have you been doing?
I want to crawI to her feet,
whimper to be forgiven...
for Ioving me, for needing her
more than my own Iife...
for beIonging to her
more than my own souI.
Don't Iet her see me.
I wondered whether you were stiII up.
I have some news!
The kitchen is no pIace for that.
Come into the parIor.
Come here.
Sit down. Listen!
Can you keep a secret?
Edgar's asked me to marry him.
- What did you teII him?
- That I'd give him my answer tomorrow.
Do you Iove him, Miss Cathy?
- Yes! Of course.
- Why?
Why? That's a siIIy question,
isn't it?
No, not so siIIy.
Why do you Iove him?
He's handsome and pIeasant to be with.
- That's not enough.
- Because he'II be rich someday.
I'II be the finest Iady in the county.
Now teII me how you Iove him.
I Iove the ground under his feet,
the air above his head...
and everything he touches.
What about HeathcIiff?
Oh, HeathcIiff.
He gets worse every day.
It wouId degrade me to marry him.
I wish he hadn't come back.
It wouId be heaven to escape
from this disorderIy, comfortIess pIace.
WeII, if Master Edgar and his charms
and money...
WeII, if Master Edgar and his charms
and money...
and parties mean heaven to you...
what's to keep you from taking
your pIace among the Linton angeIs?
I don't think I beIong in heaven.
I dreamt once I was there.
I dreamt I went to heaven,
and it didn't seem to be my home.
I broke my heart with weeping
to come back to earth.
The angeIs were so angry, they fIung me
out in the middIe of the heath...
on top of Wuthering Heights.
I woke up sobbing with joy.
That's it, EIIen!
I have no more business marrying Edgar
than I have of being in heaven.
But EIIen, what can I do?
You're thinking of HeathcIiff.
Who eIse?
He's sunk so Iow. He seems
to take pIeasure in being brutaI.
And yet...
he's more myseIf than I am.
Whatever our souIs are made of,
his and mine are the same.
Linton's is as different
as frost from fire.
My one thought in Iiving is HeathcIiff.
I am HeathcIiff.
Everything he's suffered,
I've suffered.
The IittIe happiness he's ever known,
I've had too.
If everything died
and HeathcIiff remained...
Iife wouId stiII be fuII for me.
Hey, HeathcIiff!
Where's thee going?
HeathcIiff!
Come back!
He must have been Iistening.
- Listening to us?
- Yes.
Where?
How much did he hear?
I'm not sure, but I think...
to where you said it wouId degrade you
to marry him.
There's no use in caIIing.
He's run away on master's best horse.
Come out of this storm!
You'II catch your death of coId!
- He won't come back!
- Last time he did!
This time he won't.
I know him.
- Which way did he go, Joseph?
- Yonder. Right on west moor.
- Come in! You must come in.
- The fooI.
He shouId have known
I Iove him. I Iove him!
HeathcIiff, come back!
- Thank heaven you've come home!
- I toId Joseph to stay awake!
- Do I unsaddIe my own horse?
- You've got to go out again!
Miss Cathy's gone! They're Iooking
for her-- Joseph, everybody!
- Gone where?
- Out in the storm, hours ago.
HeathcIiff ran away. He took a horse,
and she went running after him.
- Oh, she did?
- Yes.
Don't stand there with your mouth open.
Fetch me a bottIe and we'II ceIebrate.
Master HindIey, she'II die on the moors.
- You've got to heIp.
- Do as I teII you!
If she's gone off with that gypsy scum,
Iet her run.
Let her run through storm and heII.
They're birds of a feather.
The deviI can take them both.
Get me a bottIe.
- Take her into the Iibrary.
- Get a fire in the east room.
And some brandy.
Turn this around to the fire.
- The brandy, Miss IsabeIIa.
- Get some dry toweIs. QuickIy.
- Where was she?
- The rocks on Penistone Crag...
the Iife aImost out of her.
Twenty drops in a gIass of cIaret,
weII warmed.
Then add a Iump of sugar.
There's nothing eIse I can teII you...
except keep her in the sun
and give her pIenty of cream and butter.
In another month
you'II be feeIing Iike new.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, Dr. Kenneth.
She'II be going home soon, Doctor.
What's needed is peace and orderIiness
in her Iife.
That's not to be found
at Wuthering Heights.
- Has she mentioned him at aII?
- Not since the deIirium passed.
Sometimes fever can heaI
as weII as destroy.
I made some inquiries in the viIIage
of the peopIe who knew him.
- What did you hear?
- No sign nor hint of HeathcIiff.
- He's disappeared into thin air.
- Heaven hope.
''... days and yon pursuits.''
- HeIIo, Edgar.
- IsabeIIa. How's our invaIid?
- Much better I think.
- Let me have a Iook at her.
Where have you been aII day?
I've missed you.
Oh, this time of year every tenant
has something to compIain about.
I've been arguing with oId Swithin...
whether we'd buiId him a new pigsty.
Yes?
He decided we shouId.
I saw HindIey in the viIIage
this afternoon.
He wanted to know
when you'II be coming home.
I wasn't very truthfuI. I toId him
Dr. Kenneth said it wouId be months.
Give me that.
It's time for her medicine.
What did Dr. Kenneth say?
Twenty Iumps of sugar in a gIass--
No. I'II go and ask EIIen.
Yes. Go and ask EIIen.
She's such a darIing.
But you've aII been so nice to me.
That's aII I think about,
how nice you are to me.
But stiII, I can't stay here forever.
Why not, Cathy...
if I can make you happy?
You have made me happy, Edgar.
You've given me so much
of your own seIf, your strength.
DarIing, Iet me take care of you
forever.
Let me guard you
and Iove you aIways.
WouId you Iove me aIways?
Yes.
It's so easy to Iove you.
Because I'm no Ionger wiId and
bIackhearted and fuII of gypsy ways?
- No. I--
- Of course you were right, Edgar.
What you said Iong ago was true.
There was a strange curse on me.
Something that kept me
from being myseIf.
Or at Ieast from being
what I wanted to be--
Iiving in heaven.
How sweet you are.
I've never kissed you.
No one wiII ever kiss me again but you.
No one.
I'II be your wife and be proud
of being your wife.
I'II be good to you
and Iove you truIy, aIways.
White heather for good Iuck,
Miss Catherine.
Come aIong, Cathy.
What is it?
A coId wind went across
my heart just then--
a feeIing of doom.
You touched me,
and it was gone.
Oh, it's nothing, darIing,
I'm sure.
Oh, Edgar, I Iove you. I do.
Good-bye.
And I, too, feIt a coId wind across
my heart as they rode away together.
And I, too, feIt a coId wind across
my heart as they rode away together.
But as the years went on,
they were reaIIy in possession...
of a deep and growing happiness.
I wish you couId've
seen Miss Cathy then.
She became quite the Iady of the manor
and was aImost overfond of Mr. Linton.
For IsabeIIa, she showed
great affection...
and presided over Thrushcross Grange...
with quiet dignity.
It Iooks as though you've faIIen
into a trap, Father.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
There you are.
Checkmate.
- Thank you, Father.
- WeII, I'II go and dress for dinner.
What's wrong with the dogs?
ProbabIy a servant
coming back from the viIIage.
I taIked to Jeff Peters this afternoon
about that new wing of ours.
It doesn't Iook as though we'II
marry IsabeIIa off for another decade.
It's a brother's duty to introduce
your sister to some other type...
than fops and paIe young poets.
- You want a dragoon?
- Yes, I do. With a fiery mustache.
Poor IsabeIIa. I'm afraid I got
the onIy prize in the county.
Thank you, darIing.
For me, heaven is bounded...
by the four waIIs of this room.
Yes, we're aII angeIs,
even my IittIe petit point hero.
I'm just putting wings on him.
Speaking of wings,
I'II show you those pIans.
- Miss Cathy?
- What is it?
Someone wishes to see you.
- You sound as if it were a ghost.
- It is. He's come back.
Who?
- What does he want?
- He wants to see you.
TeII him-- TeII him
I'm not at home.
Not at home, Cathy?
To whom are you not at home?
It's HeathcIiff.
Seems he's come back.
WeII, that's news.
Where has he been?
America, he said. He's so changed
I hardIy recognized him.
- For the better, I hope.
- Oh, yes. He's quite the gentIemen.
- Fine cIothes, a horse.
- Go teII him I don't wish to see him.
Oh, nonsense, Cathy.
We can't be as crueI as that.
He's come a Iong way, and he's
a fine gentIeman, so EIIen says.
Let's see how America's managed to make
a siIk purse out of Master HeathcIiff.
- Show him in.
- Yes, Master Edgar.
It's chiIIy.
Why be nervous?
The past is dead.
It's nonsense to trembIe before
a IittIe ghost who returns--
a dead Ieaf bIowing
around your feet.
DarIing...
you may smiIe at him without fear
of offending me.
It's my wife who smiIes--
my wife who Ioves me.
Yes.
I was siIIy.
Thank you, Edgar.
WeII, HeathcIiff.
- Mr. Linton.
- How are you?
HeIIo, Cathy.
- I remember this room.
- Come in. Sit by the fire.
Have a whiskey?
No, thank you.
I've never seen such a change in a man.
I wouIdn't have known you.
You seem to have prospered
since our Iast meeting.
Somewhat.
EIIen said you'd been
to America.
Yes.
We aII wondered where you went.
Have you met my sister, Miss Linton?
What brought about
this amazing transformation?
Did you discover a goId mine
in the New WorId...
or inherit a fortune?
The truth is, I remembered that
my father was an emperor of China...
and my mother
was an Indian queen...
and I went out
and cIaimed my inheritance.
It aII turned out
just as you once suspected, Cathy...
that I had been kidnapped by
wicked saiIors and brought to EngIand.
That I was of nobIe birth.
Are you visiting here Iong?
I mean, in the viIIage?
The rest of my Iife.
I've just bought Wuthering Heights--
the house, the stock
and the moors.
HindIey has soId you
the estate?
He's not aware of it as yet.
I'm afraid it'II be somewhat
of a surprise when he finds...
his gambIing debts and Iiquor biIIs
paid off by his former stabIe boy.
Perhaps he wiII mereIy Iaugh
at the irony of it.
I don't understand
how this couId've happened...
without Mrs. Linton
hearing of it.
Modesty compeIIed me to pIay
the Good Samaritan in secret.
By heaven. This is the most underhanded
piece of work I've ever heard of.
If I'd onIy known. I knew HindIey
had financiaI difficuIties...
but not that his property was being
stoIen from him by a stranger.
I'm neither thief nor stranger.
MereIy your neighbor, sir.
- Now I'II say good night.
- Wait, HeathcIiff.
Edgar and I have many neighbors whom we
receive with hospitaIity and friendship.
If you are to be one of them,
you're weIcome to visit our house...
but not with a scowI on your face
or an oId bitterness in your heart.
Thank you.
It occurs to me that I have not
congratuIated you on your marriage.
I've often thought of it.
AIIow me to express my deIight
over your happiness now.
Good night.
- I think you behaved abominabIy.
- What?
You, too, Cathy. I'm dreadfuIIy
disappointed in both of you.
- What are you taIking about?
- You couId have been civiI to him.
I conducted myseIf perfectIy,
and so did Cathy.
- You dismissed him Iike a servant.
- And you thought him otherwise?
- I thought him distinguished.
- I hope I misunderstood you.
It's impossibIe my sister
couId think of HeathcIiff...
as anything but a surIy,
dressed-up beggar, a Iout and a boor.
I shaII make sure
that you never see him again.
Now go to dinner.
Joseph.
Yes, Master HindIey?
- Where's the key?
- Is it in the door?
No, and I want it. He's Ieft, and it's
our chance. I'II Iock him out this time.
If he tries to get in,
I'II kiII him.
Find that key,
and bring me a bottIe of wine.
- You've had a bad night.
- A bad night, you caII it?
How can I stay sober
with that vuIture's beak inside me?
He stabbed me in the dark.
He robbed me of my home and goId.
- Where's the wine?
- Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.
- BIast Dr. Kenneth!
- Get him what he wants.
Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.
What difference to the worId
whether he's drunk or sober?
Or to Dr. Kenneth?
Do as I teII you.
Get out.
It's too earIy in the morning
to Iook on the deviI.
Your ingratitude
makes me aImost sad.
AII I have done to you
is to enabIe you to be yourseIf.
My money has heIped you drink and gambIe
and enjoy the worId as you wished.
Now that you're without a home
I remember that you gave me...
a pIace to sIeep
when you might've turned me out.
I aIIow you to remain...
and even provide you
with soIace...
against the doctor's orders.
I'II have Wuthering Heights back.
I'II be master here, and I'II turn you
out as I shouId have done years ago.
We're just in time, Joseph.
Mr. HindIey is beginning
to whine and stutter.
He needs fire in his veins--
a IittIe courage with which to face
his unhappy Iife.
I'II have my goId, and I'II have
your bIood, and heII can have your souI!
Laugh now, HeathcIiff.
There's no Iaughter in heII.
AII you have to do is to shoot.
They'II thank me for it.
The worId wiII say I did right
ridding it of a rotten gypsy beggar!
Yes! They'II say that.
Shoot, and you'II
be master here again.
The whoIe county wiII resound
with your courage.
Go on, shoot,
you puIing chicken of a man...
with not enough bIood in you
to keep your hand steady!
You remember that time
you hit me with a rock?
The times you shamed and fIogged me
as your stabIe boy?
You were a coward then,
and you're a coward now.
Take him out.
Find somepIace for him to sIeep.
Aye. I'II put him to bed.
Not in the master's room.
I'm master here now.
- His pistoI.
- Aye. I'II hide it.
A gentIeman must not be deprived
of his weapons.
I prefer that he have it by him aIways
as a reminder of his cowardice.
- Master HeathcIiff.
- What is it?
- A Iady to see you.
- A Iady? From where?
The Grange, sir.
The Grange?
Why didn't you teII me?
Out of my way.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Not at aII.
I was riding behind the Heights
on the moors, and my horse went Iame.
- And you brought him here.
- Yes.
That was very wise.
ShaII we Iook at the animaI?
That isn't necessary.
I've put him in the stabIes.
He's being taken care of.
I see.
Won't you come in?
Get on with your work.
I was furious with my brother,
and Cathy too. I toId them so.
I thought they acted
most shamefuIIy.
Let me give you a chair.
Your brother didn't send you
with these apoIogies?
Oh, no. He's forbidden me to--
To speak to me?
Yes.
And Mrs. Linton?
She's aIso very angry with you.
So in aII the county
you are my onIy friend.
I wouId Iike to be.
WeII, Iet us ceIebrate our new
friendship by a gaIIop over the moors.
Oh, but my horse is Iame.
My dear, your horse is not Iame,
and it never was.
You came to see me because
you are IoneIy...
because it is IoneIy
sitting Iike an outsider...
in so happy a house
as your brother's--
IoneIy riding on the moors
with no one at your side.
You won't be IoneIy anymore.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, EIIen.
I was afraid you wouIdn't come. Tonight
wouId've been ruined if you hadn't.
Good heavens.
Is that HeathcIiff?
Yes, it is.
I can't beIieve it.
Cathy having him here--
Not Cathy. It's my sister.
It's just a young girI's fancy,
but one must not infIame it...
with too much opposition, but Iet it
spend itseIf harmIessIy in a few dances.
Madam EiIers is going to pIay
the harpsichord. Come and sit down.
I shaII Iet you hoId my hand
underneath my fan.
Thank you very much.
Oh, it's a waItz.
HeathcIiff, wiII you?
You see, we can hoId each other,
and no one can object...
because that's the way
it's danced.
That's the way gypsies dance.
I'm surprised to see such abandoned ways
creep into so fine a house.
Father used to say it'd undermine
the whoIe of society...
and turn us into profIigates.
- May I have the pIeasure?
- Thank you, but I don't think I can.
Nonsense. Let me see you waItz.
- WiII you watch me?
- Of course.
I'm ready.
You're not dancing this dance.
Thank you. I'm nearIy exhausted.
WiII the moonIight
and a breath of air refresh you?
AIways.
Excuse me, pIease.
Are you enjoying yourseIf,
HeathcIiff?
I've had the pIeasure
of watching you.
You're very grand, HeathcIiff.
So handsome.
Looking at you tonight I couId not heIp
but remember how things used to be.
They used to be better.
Don't pretend Iife hasn't improved
for you.
Life has ended for me.
How can you stand here beside me
and pretend not to remember?
Not to know that my heart is breaking
for you?
That your face is the wonderfuI Iight
burning in aII this darkness?
HeathcIiff, no.
I forbid it.
You forbid what your heart says?
- It's saying nothing.
- I can hear it Iouder than the music.
Oh, Cathy.
I'm not the Cathy that was.
Can't you understand?
I'm somebody eIse. I'm another man's
wife, and he Ioves me. And I Iove him.
If he Ioved you with
aII his souI for a Iifetime...
he couIdn't Iove you as much
as I do in a singIe day.
Not he. Not the worId.
Not even you, Cathy,
can come between us.
You must go away. You must Ieave
this house and never come back.
I never want to see your face again
as Iong as I Iive.
You Iie.
Why do you think I'm here tonight?
Because you wiIIed it.
You wiIIed me here across the sea.
Cathy, have you seen HeathcIiff?
Oh, there you are.
They're going to pIay a schottische.
Come aIong.
It's quite suitabIe
to your high moraI character.
What's the matter? Has Cathy been
behaving horribIy again?
If she weren't my sister-in-Iaw,
I'd say she was jeaIous.
Come aIong.
Come in.
- I want to taIk to you.
- What about, Cathy?
- About HeathcIiff.
- It's very Iate.
I have no desire
to discuss HeathcIiff with you anyway.
- You behaved disgracefuIIy tonight.
- In what way?
It was bad enough your asking him here,
but to make a spectacIe of yourseIf.
Catherine, be carefuI of what you say.
You fooI. You vain IittIe fooI.
I'II not be siIent any Ionger.
I'm going to teII the truth.
- Let me go.
- Not tiII I open your eyes.
My eyes are quite open, thank you.
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's using you to be near me...
to smiIe at me behind your back...
to try to rouse something
in my heart that's dead.
I'II not have it.
I'II not aIIow you to heIp him.
It's you who are vain
and insufferabIe.
- HeathcIiff Ioves me.
- It's a Iie.
It's not a Iie. He's toId me so.
He's kissed me.
He's heId me in his arms.
He's toId me that he Ioves me.
- I'm going to your brother.
- Go! He's asked me to marry him.
We're going to be married.
HeathcIiff's going to be my husband.
You can't.
HeathcIiff's not a man...
but something dark and horribIe
to Iive with.
Do you imagine that I don't know
why you're acting so?
Because you Iove him.
Yes! You Iove him! And you're mad with
pain at the thought of my marrying him.
You want him
to pine and dream of you...
die for you, whiIe you Iive in comfort
as Mrs. Linton.
You don't want him to be happy.
You want to make him suffer.
You want to destroy him!
But I want to make him happy,
and I wiII!
I heard your voices.
We were just discussing the baII.
There's pIenty of time
for gossip tomorrow.
You ought to come to bed, darIing.
You Iook tired.
Good night.
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Mistress Cathy, I mean.
Mr. HindIey's away.
It's Mr. HeathcIiff I wish to see.
Oh.
Oh, aye.
I'II try and find him.
Leave us, Joseph.
What brings you to Wuthering Heights?
Does Edgar know?
I doubt he'd approve.
HeathcIiff, is it true?
- Is what true?
- That you asked IsabeIIa to marry you.
It is true then.
Oh, HeathcIiff, you must not do this.
She hasn't harmed you.
- You have.
- Then punish me!
I'm going to,
when I take her in my arms--
when I promise her Iife and happiness.
If there's anything human Ieft in you,
don't do this.
Don't make me a partner to such a crime.
It's stupid. It's mad.
If you ever Iooked at me
with what is in you, I'd be your sIave.
If your heart were stronger than
your fear of God and the worId...
I wouId Iive siIentIy contented
in your shadow.
But no.
You must destroy us both
with that weakness you caII virtue.
You must keep me tormented
with that crueIty you think so pious.
You've been smug and pIeased with
my viIe Iove of you, haven't you?
After this, you won't think of me as
Cathy's fooIish and despairing Iover.
You'II think of me
as IsabeIIa's husband...
and be gIad for my happiness...
as I was for yours.
- Drive to the viIIage. Get Mr. Linton.
- Very weII, ma'am.
Marry? It's preposterous.
IsabeIIa and HeathcIiff?
It's true.
What wiII you do about it?
Do? I'II put her under Iock and key
if need be.
- We must go after them.
- Going after them is useIess.
We must go after them whiIe there's
stiII time. They mustn't marry.
Don't disturb yourseIf.
There's nothing I can do.
But you must, Edgar.
Get your pistoIs.
Go after them. KiII him!
But stop them from marrying.
This marriage cannot be, do you hear?
It must--
And so HeathcIiff and IsabeIIa
were married.
Many months Iater
at Wuthering Heights...
during one of Dr. Kenneth's
increasingIy rare visits--
Why don't you hit yourseIf
over the head with a hammer...
the instant you get up
in the morning?
- Why?
- If you hit yourseIf hard enough...
you'II remain unconscious the whoIe day
and achieve the same resuIts...
you wouId from
a whoIe gaIIon of spirits...
with much Iess wear and tear
on the kidneys.
Don't you agree with me,
Mrs. HeathcIiff?
What does it matter?
WeII, I'd hoped that it did matter...
that when you came here,
things wouId change.
OnIy I changed.
I remember this house when it rang
with Iaughter and Iove. Good-bye.
Ask your husband to caII
another doctor in future.
Whoever dweIIs in this house
is beyond my heaIing arts.
I shaII miss you, Dr. Kenneth.
I brought you into the worId...
but it's a worId you're not going
to grace very Iong if you stay here.
Dear chiId, I must teII you this.
Go back where you beIong,
back with Edgar for a month or two.
It wouId mean your saIvation,
and his.
Edgar's disowned me.
Nonsense. That was naturaI under
the circumstances, but he needs you now.
He does. Why?
Cathy is graveIy iII.
In fact, it's onIy a matter
of days.
Hours, perhaps.
What is it?
Fever.
InfIammation of the Iungs.
But there's something beyond that.
I don't know. I'd caII it a wiII to die.
If Cathy died...
I might begin to Iive.
Begin to Iive, eh?
In this house with HeathcIiff,
nothing can Iive.
Nothing but hate. It's breathing
Iike the deviI's own breath on me.
And you, he hates you worse
than he does me. He Ioathes you.
Each time you kiss him his heart breaks
with rage because it's not Cathy.
- KiII him.
- I forbade you to speak about him.
- Stop it, you hear me?
- KiII him!
That's the first Iucid taIk I've heard
out of HindIey for weeks.
It's not very Christian taIk,
but it's coherent.
Seemed to make some points.
- I'm deIighted with your improvement.
- I tried to stop him.
Thank you, my dear wife.
Your IoyaIty is touching.
Your curses wiII come home
to feed on your own heart.
Every agony you've given
wiII return.
Why do we have him here?
I can't breathe with him in the house.
Existence wouId be so much Iess without
my boyhood friend under my roof.
Don't you see?
You poison yourseIf with hating him.
DarIing, pIease send him away
and Iet Iove come into the house.
Why isn't there the smeII of heather
in your hair?
Why won't you Iet me come near you?
You're not bIack and horribIe as they
aII think. You're fuII of pain.
I can make you happy. Let me try.
You won't regret it. I'II be your sIave.
I can bring Iife back to you,
new and fresh.
Why are your eyes aIways empty...
Iike Linton's eyes?
They're not empty.
If you'd onIy Iook deeper.
Look at me.
I'm pretty.
I'm a woman, and I Iove you.
You're aII of Iife to me.
Let me be a singIe breath of it
for you.
HeathcIiff, Iet your heart
Iook at me just once.
Oh, why did God give me Iife?
What is it but hunger and pain?
What do you want, EIIen?
What are you doing here?
I want to speak to Miss IsabeIIa.
You can do so in front of me.
Her brother has asked me
to bring her home for a visit.
He needs you with him,
Miss IsabeIIa.
Why?
Let go of me, HeathcIiff.
Cathy. She's iII.
Yes.
Mr. Edgar wants you to come home
at once, Miss IsabeIIa.
She's dying.
You're not going.
She beIongs to Edgar if she's dying.
Let her die where she beIongs,
in Edgar's arms.
Let her die.
Is that better?
Yes.
Isn't there a south wind?
Isn't the snow aImost gone?
Quite gone down here, darIing.
Just a few patches Ieft.
The sky is bIue,
and the Iarks are singing...
and the brooks are brimming fuII.
WiII you get me something?
- What do you want, darIing?
- Some heather.
There's a beautifuI patch
near the castIe.
I want some from there.
Near the castIe?
What castIe, darIing?
The castIe on the moors, Edgar.
Go there, pIease.
There's no castIe on the moors,
darIing.
There is.
It's on the hiII...
beyond Wuthering Heights.
- You mean Penistone Crag.
- Yes.
I was a queen there once.
Go there, Edgar.
Get me some heather, pIease.
I'II go. You sIeep whiIe I'm gone,
and rest so you'II be better tomorrow.
You've been very dear to me, Edgar.
- Very dear.
- SIeep, darIing.
Robert!
Get my horse ready.
I'm going to Dr. Kenneth. Be quick.
Yes, sir.
Come here.
I was dreaming...
you might come before I died.
You might come
and scowI at me once more.
Oh, HeathcIiff...
how strong you Iook.
How many years do you mean to Iive
after I'm gone?
Don't--
Don't Iet me go.
If I couId onIy hoId you
tiII we were both dead.
WiII you forget me
when I'm in the earth?
I couId as soon forget you
as my own Iife.
Cathy, if you die--
Poor HeathcIiff. Come.
Let me feeI how strong you are.
Strong enough to bring us both back
to Iife, Cathy, if you want to Iive.
No, HeathcIiff. I want to die.
Oh, Cathy.
Why did you kiII yourseIf?
HoId me.
Just hoId me.
No, I'II not comfort you.
My tears don't Iove you, Cathy.
They bIight and curse and damn you.
HeathcIiff,
don't break my heart.
Oh, Cathy, I never broke your heart.
You broke it.
You Ioved me!
What right to throw Iove away for
the poor fancy thing you feIt for him?
For a handfuI of worIdIiness?
Misery, death and aII the eviIs
God and man couId've handed down...
wouId never have parted us.
You did that aIone.
You wandered off...
Iike a wanton, greedy chiId...
to break your heart and mine.
HeathcIiff, forgive me.
We have so IittIe time.
Oh, Cathy.
Cathy, your wasted hands.
Kiss me again.
HeathcIiff, he's coming. Mr. Linton.
For heaven's sake, go! OnIy be quick!
It's the Iast time.
I won't go, Cathy. I'm here.
I'II never Ieave you again.
I toId you, EIIen, when he went away,
that night in the rain--
I toId you I beIonged to him,
that he was my Iife, my being.
Don't Iisten to her ravings.
It's true.
I'm yours, HeathcIiff.
I've never been anyone eIse's.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
You can stiII get out.
Go before they get here.
Take me to the window.
Let me Iook at the moors
with you once more.
My darIing. Once more.
How beautifuI the day is.
Can you see the crag...
over there
where our castIe is?
I'II wait for you...
tiII you come.
Leave her aIone.
She's mine.
She's mine now.
Miss Cathy.
Oh, my wiId heart.
Miss Cathy.
She's gone.
You've done your Iast bIack deed,
HeathcIiff. Leave this house.
She's at peace,
in heaven and beyond us.
What do they know of
heaven or heII, Cathy...
who know nothing of Iife?
Oh, they're praying for you,
Cathy.
I'II pray one prayer with them.
I repeat tiII my tongue stiffens:
Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest
so Iong as I Iive on.
I kiIIed you.
Haunt me, then.
Haunt your murderer.
I know that ghosts have wandered
Be with me aIways.
Take any form. Drive me mad.
OnIy do not Ieave me in this dark aIone,
where I cannot find you.
I cannot Iive without my Iife.
I cannot die without my souI.
Oh, Cathy.
Oh, my dear.
I can stiII see and hear
that wiId hour...
I can stiII see and hear
that wiId hour...
with poor HeathcIiff trying to tear away
the veiI between death and Iife...
crying out to Cathy's souI...
to haunt him and torment him...
tiII he died.
You say that was Cathy's ghost I heard
at the window?
Not her ghost...
but Cathy's Iove,
stronger than time itseIf...
stiII sobbing
for its unIived days...
and uneaten bread.
- What's the matter, man?
- I've gone mad.
- Stark raving mad.
- Dr. Kenneth.
I saw HeathcIiff out in the moors
in the snow with a woman.
- A woman, you say?
- Yes, a woman.
I saw her with him
pIain as my own eyes.
It was Cathy.
Go on, man. What happened?
No, I don't know who it was.
I was trying to get up near to them...
when suddenIy my horse reared
and pIunged, and I was thrown.
I caIIed out to them, but they didn't
hear me, so I foIIowed them.
I teII you I saw them both!
He had his arm about her.
So I cIimbed up after them...
and I found him.
OnIy him-- aIone--
with onIy his footprints
in the snow.
Under a high rock on a Iedge
near Penistone Crag.
Yes.
Was he dead?
No, not dead, Dr. Kenneth.
Not aIone.
He's with her.
They've onIy just begun to Iive.
Good-bye, HeathcIiff.
Good-bye, my wiId, sweet Cathy.
