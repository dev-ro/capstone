- Good evening, madam.
- I'm here to meet someone,
- Adam Lucas.
- I don't believe he has arrived.
Perhaps you'd like
to look inside.
I'm afraid I don't know
what he looks like.
If you take a seat at
the bar or at your table,
I'll show him in
when he arrives.
- My table will be fine.
- Very well.
J Happy Birthday to Y cu J 'y
Excuse me.
Could you ask that man who's
sitting alone over there...
if his name is Adam Lucas?
Thank you.
- I'm sorry, ma'am, no.
- Thank you very much.
Taxi.
That's enough for now.
I'll get it. They're probably here
to pick up my angels.
This is incredible, isn't it?
I had a feeling
I knew you from somewhere.
- I had a feeling.
- You did?
I was bringing this
amphora in to be repaired.
You don't remember,
but I was in here about a year ago.
I brought in a mosaic,
third century from Herculanium,
portrait of a young boy.
There was another woman, dark-haired.
She worked on the piece.
Charlotte, my partner.
I remember that mosaic.
- She did a terrific job.
- Good.
I'm Jack Saunders,
Curator of Antiquities,
- Founders Museum.
- Adrienne Davis. I don't have a title.
It's nice to meet you finally.
- Same.
- Adrienne, I'm leaving.
- I'll lock up.
- See you tomorrow.
- That's her.
- Let's have a look at that.
We used to have
a house in Searsport, Maine.
I had an aunt and uncle
who had a house...
- not ten minutes from Searsport.
- You're kidding me.
Me and my cousins used to go there,
swim all summer.
- Really? - You and I were
probably there at the same time.
Ever go to a place
called The Breakers?
We used to try to sneak into The Breakers
to dance and listen to the music.
- I can't believe this.
- What's your favourite song?
"Earth Angel."
Good morning.
No, don't get up, please.
Go on doing whatever it was
you were doing.
Here's to Adam Lucas,
with deepest gratitude.
- Who?
- Your blind date the other night.
Oh.
So, what are you doing tonight?
I don't know.
How about tomorrow night?
I don't know.
How about the rest of your life?
Am I being too presumptuous?
Well, that remains to be seen.
Mommy, can I blow out
the candles now?
- Hang on, honey.
- Let's sing "Happy Birthday."
- Mommy, can I cut it now?
- Yes!
Thank you, Daddy.
My scariest purchase
was one-million-two...
for an Etruscan urn.
It was in perfect condition.
It was so perfect,
they had doubts of its authenticity.
We had five authenticators
on that one.
Best piece I ever purchased.
That's enough business.
We have cake here.
Give me that!
I want that.
No, you don't!
- No more nothing!
- No more nothing!
It's me.
- The day you were born, the happiest
day of my life. - Mine, too.
Where's Granny and Papa?
- Granny and Papa? You mean, mine?
- Yours.
Okay, where are they?
Is that them?
- That's not them.
- Is that them?
That's not them, either.
- That's them.
- Okay, here's a picture of me...
when I was a boy in Nebraska.
Standing next to me
is Grandpapa Thomas.
Standing next to him is
your grandmother, Lorraine.
Over here is a bicycle
I used to ride.
- See that ?
- Mm-hmm.
Over here where you can't see...
is a hill where we used
to go tobogganing.
Tell me again
about Granny's eyes.
Granny's eyes were beautiful,
exactly like...
- Exactly like mine.
- Right.
Okay, time to go to sleep.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, Sweetie.
- You know what I'm thinking?
- What?
How lucky I am.
Lucky how?
You don't know anything.
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
You're more beautiful
than she is.
- Adrienne Saunders.
- Hey!
- What are you wearing?
- A slip.
- Your underwear?
- Do you like it?
- You look great!
- Thanks.
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi, Harvey.
I was wondering if
you'd get around to me.
I hate these things.
I'll see you later.
You two should form a club.
Oh, look at this.
Pretty interesting.
- Jack, has the urn arrived?
- It was supposed to come in yesterday.
- I'm heartbroken to part with it.
- I'll tell you what.
We're gonna give you special
visitation rights, okay?
It's a very generous gift,
Mrs Peabody.
- We're infinitely grateful.
- Good.
- Where's Tomasz?
- I don't know. We just got here.
- If you see him, tell him I want
him to thank me too. - I will.
"Special visitation rights"?
- You're so smooth.
- It takes practice.
And who do you
practise on? Me?
Whenever I get the chance.
Excuse me, Haw.
I'm gonna check on Mary.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Ooh!
Aaah!
Oh...
Oh, my God!
Did you sense any depression?
Any mood swings?
I saw him just this afternoon.
He seemed fine.
Maybe he was depressed
about his heart condition.
He was taking a lot of pills.
He was talking
about a fishing trip.
- He was planning a trip.
- Yeah.
He spoke to me about that
up in Connecticut.
Mrs Saunders,
it would be best...
if you would come down
to the station tomorrow.
We need you to sign a statement.
Of course.
Of course.
What about the rest of us?
That won't be necessary.
We'll contact you
if we need anything more.
Are you all right?
- No.
- Are you okay?
A cop tells you to
sign a statement,
- and that's supposed to close the book?
- What do you expect?
- They see hundreds of these a week.
- Well, I don't.
- I think Tomasz deserved better than that.
- I know how you feel.
I want to know why a guy
who's gonna commit suicide...
sets his watch to
take heart medication.
Adrienne, they told you.
The watch was probably preset.
- He didn't even think about it.
- You're probably right.
I need you to sign this
piece out, Jean.
- We're loaning it to the Corcoran for
their Egyptian exhibit. - Thanks.
Hmm.
It looks like someone's
already run a test on this.
I got your bath ready, sweetie.
- Now take your clothes off.
- Okay.
I'll be right back.
- Hi.
- Hmm.
What's the matter?
They discovered
a fake necklace...
in the Egyptian collection
at the museum.
Four-and-a-half
million dollars,
and I bought it.
Who authenticated it?
Harvey.
Harvey authenticated it
but it's my ass on the line.
It's my career, my reputation.
Damn, I know what I bought.
I know it was real.
Somebody must've switched them.
Tomasz.
What?
Maybe he was in trouble.
Maybe he needed money.
Something could have happened.
Honey...
Tomasz was not a criminal.
I'm trying to tell you,
everybody's going to be looking at me.
They're all looking at me.
- That's good, honey.
- Yeah.
Let me get your back.
It's not too hot, is it?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what
I'd do without you.
You'd think of something.
Who are you?
- You want me to make you guys some dinner?
- Mm-hmm.
What do you want?
Fried soapsuds?
No.
I love you.
Thanks.
Hello, Ernesto's?
I want to order take-out.
Three chicken fricassees.
Two rice and beans.
Do we have any Coke?
- Yep.
- No Coke. I have another call.
I'll pick it up in
ten minutes. Thanks.
Hello?
Yeah, this is me.
Son of a bitch!
I can't believe this.
Now, with everyth...?
All right. All right.
I'll be there.
Okay, bye-bye.
I have to go to Boston.
- Boston?
- Of all the stupid times,
with everything that's going on.
- What is it?
- An auction... the Morgan Collection.
Under the circumstances,
I can hardly say no.
- When do you have to leave?
- There's a 10:00 flight.
Honey, could you get
my grey suit?
Okay-
Do you need this stuff?
What is it?
- American express receipt and
a business card. - Whose?
- Daniel Sherman.
- Who's he?
Beats me. There's
a number on the back.
- I don't know.
- Toss it.
Do you need a cab?
No, I'm gonna take the car.
- You had a bad day, didn't you?
- Mmm.
I love you.
And I love you.
Hurry home, honey.
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.
- Wow! - Gonna draw straws to
see who gets to go up there.
- I'd love to go up there.
- Was Jack gonna meet you here today?
- Nope, he's not here. - I could've
sworn I saw him go into the lounge.
- He's in Boston, back tomorrow.
- Weird.
This is gonna be a lot of work.
We gotta get those guys
with the scaffolding,
like pronto.
Honey?
I love it.
It's great!
You shouldn't have done this.
Who says I did it for you?
I should've known.
The weirdest thing
happened to me yesterday.
I was with Charlotte, scouting a job
at the Chesterfield Hotel,
and, urn...
she said that...
she could've sworn she saw you
going into the lounge there.
Tell me the truth. Were you
in New York City yesterday?
Are you having an affair?
Am I having an affair
at the Chesterfield?
- Are you kidding?
They have rotten room service.
You would think
by your sixth anniversary...
you wouldn't have
to wait for a table.
By your 60th anniversary
you don't have to wait.
Of course.
Let's have a toast anyway.
- Harvey, you're good at that. Would you
make a toast? - I'm not feeling witty.
I'll make a toast.
Here's the toast.
With deepest gratitude
to Adam Lucas.
- Who's Adam Lucas?
- That is a very good story.
I'm gonna see about our table.
I got some clout.
- Tell me a joke, Harv.
- Life sucks.
- What's the punch line?
- There isn't one.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing in particular.
Come on, you can tell me.
I had to go to
Tomasz's family...
and ask for his bank statements.
God, I felt like such a shit!
What were you looking for?
We traced the forgery
to a jeweler in Stuttgart...
who said the necklace was made
for a guy named Daniel Sherman,
who paid $10,000
in traveler's cheques.
- Daniel Sherman.
- I'm sure it's an alias.
The point is, there was nothing
irregular in Tomasz's account.
So, now we're all fair game.
Table's ready.
Listen, this is, uh...
This is not what we agreed upon.
No, because it's not...
I told you this before,
that if this came up...
What was...
It's okay.
It's no problem.
Yeah, me too.
See you soon. Bye-bye.
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yeah.
I just realized...
I had to make this long-distance
call to San Francisco,
with the time difference
and everything.
It's okay now.
It's fine.
Are you all right?
Did I wake you up?
Let's go back to bed.
I'm colouring my bird purple.
- Is he a magic bird?
- Maybe.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Do you like my colouring?
- I love your colouring.
- That's great. Colour the trees.
- What colour?
- Hello?
- Is Mr Jack Saunders there?
He's not in.
Can I take a message?
- What colour should I use?
- Colour them green.
This is Vogue Lingerie.
Mr Saunders was here the other day
and left his credit card.
Really?
You calling from Boston?
No, this is Vogue Lingerie
on East 53rd Street...
in Manhattan.
- This is the Saunders residence?
- Yes, it is.
- You have the right number.
- Maybe he'd like to come pick it up.
I'll tell him.
Thank you.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know you
were in here. - That's okay.
I was just going through
some old papers.
I was getting his suits
for the cleaners,
- the ones he took to Boston. - Leave those
there and we'll take them in tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
What's going on?
What's all this?
Urn, I was just
looking for something.
What?
I found this
in your suit pocket,
the one you wore to Boston.
You didn't go to Boston.
That was you at the
Chesterfield Hotel, wasn't it?
You found a piece of candy in my
suit pocket, a stupid little mint, and...
Suddenly I'm a liar?
You're accusing me of lying...
and what else?
Of having an affair?
Jesus Christ.
I don't believe this.
Do you have any idea how many receptions
I've been to at The Chesterfield?
Do you have any idea at all?
What else am I lying
about, Adrienne?
What else?
What about my nightgown?
What about it?
The lady called from
the lingerie shop.
You left your
credit card there...
on 53rd Street, in New York.
You told me that you
bought it in Boston.
No, I didn't.
I never said that.
I never did.
I simply decided to buy you a gift,
and stopped in midtown...
on my way home from the airport.
What else, Adrienne?
What about Daniel Sherman?
Who?
Daniel Sherman.
You had his business card,
the one I found
in your suit pocket.
Harvey said they traced the forgery
to a guy with the same name.
Harvey Schwartz.
I'm your husband and you're
listening to Harvey Schwartz.
Do you have any idea
how many people...
hand me a business card
in a day?
Has it occurred to you...
that Harvey Schwartz
is just as much a suspect...
- in this thing as anybody else?
- Harvey?
You sound so astonished
and yet you suspected me.
I didn't suspect you.
- Yes you did, Adrienne.
- No, I didn't.
You just did.
Jack, wait a minute.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Jack, please.
Come on.
Let's talk about this.
Don't go.
I can't talk to you.
You wouldn't understand.
Daddy!
Hi, sweetie.
I'll be back, okay?
All right?
You be with Mommy.
Been waitin' long?
Mommy, can I paint
the roses too?
- Yes. Go get some brushes.
- Okay.
I found a great Italian deli.
- I'll get it.
- Maybe it's Daddy.
Maybe it is.
Good evening, ma'am.
Are you Mrs Adrienne Saunders?
Yes, I am.
Mr Dagota?
Your son's personal effects.
I'll need you to sign for them.
Mrs Saunders.
Mrs Saunders?
I'll need your signature
on this identification form...
to verify that these are
your husband's personal effects.
Yes...
these are.
Everything feels so wrong.
So strange.
What am I gonna do
with all his clothes?
I just bought him
some new shirts.
You just have to
wait it out, I guess.
I mean, that's all you can do.
And remember,
you always have me.
So if you really need
a change of space...
Granny said Daddy was in heaven.
Do you think he's in heaven?
Is he with his Granny and Papa?
I think so, sweetheart.
But he didn't even say goodbye.
I know, honey.
But because of you,
Daddy's gonna go on forever.
Go get your coat on, honey.
Take your toast with you.
Okay-
- Hello.
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
The house is a mess.
- I'll have it together by the
time you get home. - Thanks.
- Bye!
- See you outside school at 1:00.
- How are you doin'?
- I'll be okay.
Adrienne, it's for you.
Someone from the Social Security office.
- Do you want to take it?
- Yeah.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs Saunders.
I don't understand what
you're trying to say to me.
We really can't release these benefits
without further approval.
I don't know what
you mean, exactly.
The contributions were made. I supplied
you with the death certificate.
We don't doubt that
your husband's dead.
Nor are we saying that the
contributions weren't made.
They were made with the wrong
social security number.
The I.R.S. screwed up
when they didn't catch it.
Your office applied
the contributions...
- to the wrong social security number?
- No.
Maybe you'd like to have somebody here.
Do you have a lawyer?
- What the hell are you telling me?
- I'm sorry.
I just don't quite know
how to say this.
The man with the
social security number...
that your husband
claimed was his, died...
16 years ago...
in Sommerville, Nebraska.
We don't know who
your husband was,
but we definitely know...
he was not this Jack Saunders.
I don't understand.
This couldn't be.
If you want to talk
to my superiors,
that's fine, but they're gonna
tell you the same thing.
Your husband used a
social security card...
that didn't belong to him.
Can we play with these?
Yes, sweetie, you can.
This one will look good on me.
Are you sure
your mother will let me have this?
Can I take these too?
Mm-hmm.
And this?
Mm-hmm.
- Carol, it's time to go.
- Can I take what I'm wearing?
Yes, but it's time to go.
Since the school system
decentralized,
we've had to store school
records for the whole area,
so we're a little casual
with the yearbooks.
Not enough space.
This whole row
is James Garfield High.
- If there are any yearbooks,
they'd be at the other end. - Okay.
I know the files
are at this end.
James Garfield.
It would be here.
They can't keep these
in alphabetical order.
Excuse me.
Instead of the records
for Jack Saunders,
could I see the records for...
- one of his classmates?
- I can't do that, Mrs Saunders.
The records are only
public information...
- if the person is deceased.
- This man is dead.
I can't prove it,
but I know that he's dead.
Please, I have to know
who this man is.
Oh, to hell with it.
Who is it?
Frank Sullivan.
Well, I found Jack Saunders.
The last one in my stack.
- Isn't it always like that?
- No Frank Sullivan?
Nope, and I was very thorough.
- You don't have it, either?
- I've got a few more to go here.
Nope.
No, I don't have it.
Can I have Jack Saunders' file?
You never know.
True, you never do.
Thank you.
Yes?
I hope I'm not bothering you,
but I'm looking for
a relative of Jack Saunders.
- Jack Saunders died 15 years ago.
- I know that.
I know this may sound strange,
but I'm trying to track down...
a friend of his, Frank Sullivan.
Urn... come in.
Jack was my cousin.
Frank was his best friend.
In fact, Jack was
Frank's only friend.
They were inseparable,
like one person.
It was odd.
I couldn't imagine two
more different people.
Frank was so quiet...
and Jack was the most outgoing,
charming person you ever met.
Frank wasn't polished like that,
but he had an unspoken charm.
- He was special.
- How about his parents?
- Are they still around?
- Oh, God. I don't know.
I think his father died.
I don't remember.
It was a long time ago.
Frank didn't talk about
his family much.
They were poor.
His father was an alcoholic.
His mother worked for
the highway department...
in a tollbooth.
Frank was embarrassed
about that.
He'd never take me to his home.
What about his family?
- Did he have any sisters or brothers?
- No, he didn't have anybody.
We were like his family.
God, those were
great days for me.
I was at a point in life
where I didn't have any direction.
And Frank, he would just sit
with me for hours, talking.
One night we went to
a coffee shop for dinner...
and we talked right
through to the morning.
We were still talking...
when they asked us what
we wanted for breakfast.
That's when I decided
to go back to school.
Urn...
After Jack died,
he kind of disappeared.
I never saw him again.
Sounds like he meant
a lot to you.
Well, what can I tell you?
Excuse me.
There you go, Morn.
Thank you.
That looks great.
What would I do without you?
Gee, I wish I could
be more help,
but I don't remember much.
I put it out of my mind
a long time ago.
Still, if you give me
your phone number,
- maybe things will come back a bit.
- Thank you.
This has been a real shock,
like out of nowhere,
if you know what I mean.
Anyway,
if you ever find him,
tell him I said hi.
- Have you been going through my drawers?
- No.
Are you sure?
It's awful messed up.
I didn't do it, Morn.
If you want to play with my things,
- Ask my permission.
- Okay.
- Hello?
- This is Evelyn Saunders.
Are you the woman I spoke with
about Frank Sullivan?
- Yes, this is Adrienne.
- Good. I'm glad.
I remembered
something last night...
middle of the night.
I could barely sleep.
His mother lives
on Carpenter Place...
beside a deli.
Don't ask how I remembered.
It just came back.
Could you wait?
I'm going to go in for a minute.
- Who is it?
- Mrs Sullivan?
My name is Adrienne Saunders.
I believe that I was
married to your son.
All these years
I thought he was dead.
Now I find out he's been living
in the same city with a wife and a kid.
A decent person would have
found out how his mother was;
if she needed anything,
like cigarettes or booze.
Not him.
- What do you call her?
- Mary.
MN'!-
She has my eyes, you know that?
People always said
I had beautiful eyes.
- He always used to say that about you.
- A lot of good it did.
Jack Saunders.
What a joke!
Jack would never have
treated his family...
the way Frank treated me.
Having him ruined my life.
Why did you marry him?
Because I loved him.
I don't wanna hear this.
He was dead...
the day he left here.
Doesn't matter to me
that he died a month ago.
He was already dead.
He was a selfish child...
and he was a selfish man.
People change, Mrs Sullivan,
especially when they're loved.
Excuse me.
I'm leaving my card in case
you ever need anything.
You know where to reach me.
- Mommy!
- Huh? What, honey?
There's a man in my room.
- What?
- I saw him.
There's not a man
in your room, sweetie.
- But I saw him.
- Come here.
Listen, do you remember you
had that dream last week?
He was the same man.
He was real.
- He was in my room looking at me.
- Okay.
- C'mon.
- All right, let's go.
What's that?
Shadows...
just shadows.
Okay-
Oh, darn it.
[ I
You're funny, Mommy.
There, you see?
There's nobody here.
He was standing there.
There's nobody now, is there?
There.
Everything's going
to be okay now.
- Thank you, Mommy.
- You wanna sleep with me?
Yeah. Can I
bring Julia?
Yes. I'll get her.
Hey, who let the cat out?
Lillian?
Mary 7
Mary 7
Lillian!
Mary g
Oh, no!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Oh, Lillian.
Oh, Jesus.
Lillian.
Help, somebody!
Oh, Jesus.
Mary.
Oh, Jesus.
Mary, Mary.
Oh, my God.
Mommy, what's going on?
There's been an
accident. C'mon.
- What's going on?
- We have to make a phone call.
Okay. All right.
We'll call back in the morning.
Thanks, doctor.
- She's gonna be okay.
- Thank God.
- Let's go. Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
Let's go get Mary.
I love you, sweetie.
Sleep tight.
What if Mary had been
in the apartment?
It could have been Mary.
- Harvey 7
- Hmm?
I'm gonna ask the police
to reinvestigate Jack's death.
I know there's a connection
between all these things.
I think you outta try
to get some sleep.
We'll talk about it
in the morning.
- I can't stop thinking about Jack.
- I know.
You should have seen the way he lived,
the way he grew up.
I didn't even know who he was.
Everything I believed in
was a lie.
- Hi, Ellen.
- Good morning.
You have a message.
Someone calling for a Rosalie Sullivan.
She said it was urgent,
needs to see you right away.
- Don't you need the address?
- Got it.
Mrs Sullivan?
Mrs Sullivan, are you here?
Mrs Sullivan?
Mrs Sullivan?
You bastard!
You bastard!
- Why did you do this to me?
- Let me talk to you.
- No. I hate you.
- Let me talk to you.
Listen to me.
Let me talk to you.
Let me talk, okay?
No,
Jack was my only friend.
When I couldn't afford
to go to college,
he educated me.
He, uh...
He told me what books to read.
He took me to the
Metropolitan, the Frick.
He was everything
I ever wanted to be.
The night he died...
It was, uh...
It was a dream,
a nightmare.
I just became him.
I was the one who cleaned out
his apartment, his papers,
his degree, his passport.
Everything was there.
I just took it.
It didn't seem like a lie.
It seemed real.
Everybody believed me.
I had all the credentials.
And after awhile,
I believed it myself...
until one day a man
appeared at my office,
Daniel Sherman.
Yeah.
He knew me when we were kids.
He knew Frank Sullivan.
He wanted money...
a lot of money.
He made forgeries and I had to
switch them for the originals.
- Who did I bury?
- You buried a hitchhiker.
He was killed in the crash.
His neck was broken.
- Oh, God.
- He was my way out.
I thought that
if I could disappear,
I could protect you and Mary.
Being dead was the price...
I had to pay to keep you safe.
Why didn't you
tell me any of this?
I thought of telling you
a thousand, thousand times.
But I could not bear to have
you think of me this way.
Or Mary.
I wanted her to
remember me from the...
pictures in that
stupid photo album.
Adrienne, I need your help.
I didn't give Sherman
one of the pieces,
the Egyptian necklace.
It must be in the loft.
I need you to find it.
I know this man.
He is a killer.
He killed Tomasz.
We have to find this
necklace and give it...
to Sherman and...
Until we do,
you're not gonna be safe...
and Mary's not gonna be safe.
Adrienne,
I don't expect
any sympathy from you.
I never wanted
to do this to you.
But I thought I had no choice.
I'm a dead man now.
I'll never see Mary again...
and I'll never be
with you again.
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.
I'm calling because
I was worried...
about you going
back there and being alone.
I was wondering if I
shouldn't be there with you?
No.
Okay, I understand.
That's not the only reason
I was calling.
After seeing you I...
I realized how much
I still love you.
And how sorry I am
for all the lies.
For all of it.
I don't blame you
for not answering.
I don't blame you at all.
Call me tomorrow.
Give me until then, okay?
All right.
Okay. Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Daddy.
- Number 23, was it?
- Yes.
Right there.
- Could you wait here?
- Sure.
Thank you.
I'm on the phone.
Come on in.
Baby's fine.
I felt him kicking.
No, I'm doing fine.
Hold on, there's someone here.
Can I help you?
- Mrs Sherman?
- Yes.
Sorry. I thought you were the packers.
Calm down, Jack!
Goon
In spite of his size,
he's still a puppy.
- What can I do for you?
- This picture, where did you get it?
Would you mind telling me
what you want?
Where did you get this picture?
It's my husband's sister.
She died in a plane crash.
What is all...
Listen, uh...
Yeah.
Blonde, yeah.
My husband wants to talk to you.
- Yes.
- So you found us.
That's pretty amazing.
I never expected this.
This complicates everything.
Now, listen to me.
I have Mary.
Mary's with me. Don't worry.
She's not gonna get hurt.
I need you to get
that necklace, Adrienne.
Mary said she traded it
with her friend, Carol.
Since I can't go
to the Gingolds,
you contact them
and try to get it back.
We can meet tonight at the loft.
I can handle things from there.
I wouldn't say anything
to the police or Cathy, if I were you.
It might complicate things
more than they already are.
Want to say hello to Mary?
Here.
Mommy, Daddy's here.
He's really here.
Nine o'clock, okay?
Say bye-bye to Mommy.
- Bye-bye, Mommy.
- Bye-bye, Mommy.
Okay, let's go.
Watch out.
I understand, but it
isn't the best time. We have guests.
I apologize. I wouldn't
bother you normally...
but I have to have
that necklace tonight.
No, she said I could have this!
I know, but the
necklace isn't a toy.
Daddy!
She said I could have it
and now she wants it back.
This is confusing for Carol.
I'm sure it is, but this happens
to be a valuable piece of jewelry.
I know how you feel.
It's very confusing...
when grown-ups do things
that aren't fair.
These things happen in life.
For Christ's sake.
Isn't anybody in charge around here?
We forgot about you, didn't we?
Do you have it?
- Where's my daughter?
- She's fine.
She's playing
with her colouring books.
She's in the car.
I wanna go see her.
Oh!
I don't know who you are.
Sure you do.
I'm your husband.
Wasn't I a good husband?
Didn't I make you happy?
Didn't you feel understood?
Didn't you feel loved?
Isn't that what it's all about?
You're sick.
I wanna get Mary.
You love me.
Now give me the necklace.
Or what?
You gonna kill me too?
No.
I'm gonna kiss you.
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I will if I have to.
That's love too.
You still love me, don't you?
Yes.
Agh!
Adrienne?
Adrienne!
Oh... come on.
Adrienne?
Adrienne!
Hi.
There's no place
to go now, Adrienne.
Now there's nowhere to hide.
I don't wanna
hurt you, Adrienne.
I never wanted to hurt anybody!
But when I have to do
something, I do it.
I always do
whatever comes next...
no matter how difficult it is.
If I have to do something,
then I do it.
I always do
whatever comes next...
no matter how difficult it is!
Now...
Give me the necklace, Adrienne.
Here.
Take it.
Uh... ahhh!
We forgot this, Mommy.
Why don't you put this
in your suitcase.
Okay-
