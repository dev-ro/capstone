I would really love to impress you.
Our only night was sudden and brief.
Like a storm.
I didn't even have time to start.
I didn't even have time to tell you what I really do.
I am a collector.
I collect the toughest and wildest of things.
... moments.
When I suddenly get a desire to fly,
and I have nowhere to fly to,
I hide in my collection,
...full of coffees, boxers, dancers...
random contacts, insults, tender outlaws,
arcades, meetings...
... screams, silences, separations,
words, words, words...
Things will flow they way they like, anyway.
Life knows.
And I trust her.
I've always belonged to those who smoke
cheap cigarettes.
- Can you please calm down?
- I told you, my battery run out!
- Please come pick me up. I've been waiting
for a taxi for ages, but I can't find anything.
- But I told you... yes.
- I told you, my battery run out!
- I don't want you to know where I am?
What do you mean?
- Please, calm down and...
- Good evening!
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready.
Every morning, you'll find me giving myself ten seconds
to realise where I am and why.
In the following 5 minutes I admit to myself
my total lack of ability for any sort of work.
I then instantly realise my tragic financial state,
which saves me time...
... which I then dedicate to the care of my fish.
There are times when I want to tell them
all about my life.
But even if they were not deaf,
their memory does not last more than 3 seconds.
Just like a stroll in the glass bowl.
Perhaps this is why I can see my whole life
in their eyes.
A repeated swirling.
A happy nothing.
These are the first moments of the day,
when inspiration comes to rescue me.
The world is based on chaos, and I will cross it
without looking for a logical order.
This is my life.
Is it clear?
- No, no, no, boy.
This is not a job. It's a social service.
You drink alcohol to forget and coffee to remember.
But then all the glory goes to the bartenders,
the sissies.
The bar is the toilet of the soul.
They wave around their bottles and ice-cubes,
to make you dizzy so that you throw up
your existential worries more easily.
The cafe, on the other hand,
is the bathroom mirror in the morning.
Like settling an account, and it's you again.
Good morning!
CARD NOT ACCEPTED. ERROR 500.
CHANGE CARD.
- Hello?
- Yeah, hello! Eh...
2030: You have a family, children, a husband, money,
and you happen to pass from this phone booth...
... and you think that maybe, that  man you
said no to, was the man of your life.
Let me prove I am not the man of your life.
Don't hang up on me.
- I have to go.
- Excuse me! Eh... I saw you are waiting for
an important phone call, isn't it?
- Yes.
- I saw your card has a problem.
- Yes.
- Don't take this as blackmail, but I can give you mine...
... if we walk together to the next phone booth.
- Why?
Won't this one do for you?
- Yes, it will do. It's just that I saw
some tension before... and... well... OK.
- Is it far?
- What?
- The next phone booth. OK?
- Yeah, sure.
-I think there is a phone booth down that way, maybe,
but I'd say we should go back that way...
... but OK, no problem, we can go this way.
I love cafes, the way others like travelling.
An industry of wasted time.
An absolute mystery.
The art of letting time pass,
and leaving no marks on you.
A kind act to yourself,
and, why not, against humanity.
- So, if Cindy Crawford comes here and offers it to you,
you... just don't care?
- Sperm should not be wasted.
- That all mankind wants to ejaculate on her,
you... no thanks?
- Maybe the gentleman does not want to have
intercourse, is there a problem with this?
- Everybody wants to fuck. Who are you, the cool guy?
And who am I? The asshole?
- I repeat: sperm should not be wasted.
And to turn this page, whether Cindy comes here or not,
I've already made up my mind.
To donate my sperm to philosophy.
- I read three sports newspapers a day.
Is there a problem?
- Even futility has its meaning.
- Go get a job! I'm not a loser. I am... who I am.
Understand? What does philosophy say about this?
- This conversation has completely lost track.
- What is the gentleman having? It's on me. Servant!
- Last night, Plato called me.
- The philosopher?
- Who else?
- And what did he say?
- You don't want to know... you'll get in trouble.
- Fuck off! Go fuck yourself! Fuck you!
No, not you.
- Well, you did very well to...
- To what?
- To... agree to... In any case I'm very happy you...
- Is it far?
- No, it's not far. I think we should go either
this way, or that way...            - Decide!
- OK, that way.
- Fine.
There are thousands of ways for a love story to begin.
But only one way to finish.
Rupture.
- He'd a whole collection of porn magazines, the loser.
In one he even had a bookmark. I felt sorry for him.
But I got what I really deserved.
1,90 and a gym instructor.
On his body... you can have an anatomy lesson
on his body. I couldn't imagine we've so many muscles.
But you'll say, where would I see it all these years?
On Thanassis? The one muscle man?
He makes me feel amazing, sensual, tender...
He calls me "pussy" ... PUSSY!
The other one had never called me that.
He never even had the guts to tell me
"Yes, baby, I like women with silicone..."
- Tolis... Impossible. Tolis...
She's going out with a guy called Tolis.
You just have to add an "s" and
it becomes "Tsolis" (=scum)
And he's a gym freak.
They'll call out at him in the gym: "Push, Tsolis!"
Thanassis! Athanasios.
Greek, Orthodox, male, direct. MANLY.
And you know: these guys, with all the exercise,
they cannot get it up.
This is how low she is now. But I won't be the one
to lower the standards of the conversation.
That's it. Enough. I've had enough!
I don't want to fuck anymore.
They are looking for men with great bodies.
Is anyone looking for men with great souls?
Chicks...
A huge conspiracy.
- So, sorry ... not because I'm a nice guy?
- You are nice. Anyone who smiles is nice.
So... if you're a bit of a hunchback, with ears
down to the shoulders and a face like an ass...
...if you smile a bit, mate,
you can surely start a career in modelling.
- With your nerve, maybe...
- Excuse me, it's not nerve.
I simply feel the obligation
to disrupt the loneliness of the other.
- First: I don't feel lonely at all.
Second: I thought they used to call this "chatting up".
- Yes, but let's not drop our standards.
- Phone booth.
- Oh, you saw it?
- Can I make that phone call now?
- That was my last credit unit.
- I thought so.
- And now what?
- And now what?
- Now we could go for a coffee.
I'd prefer never to introduce you to Manolis. He
always appears suddenly and disappears in the same way.
He was always the strangest kid in the neighbourhood,
and nothing he does can surprise me.
Not even that he demands to call me only at the
phone booth opposite the Acropolis.
He says he has a job for me.
Good money, quick and clean.
I don't know whether my motivation is
my tragic financial situation,
or that Manolis knows how
to create a film noir atmosphere.
- The face! I missed this bright face.
Don't speak, don't speak!
I can hardly keep myself from
filling you with kisses.
Not you, fucker! You, I'm going to fill with bullets!
In front of me I have a superior face, a bright face.
And I keep him waiting for you, turd!
Apologise now! Now, you shit-soul!
- I'm sorry..
- I love you. That was it.
The road of excess...
Where does it lead, do you know?
To the palace of wisdom.
We will collaborate.
My poet.
Manolis' charm is that he hates details.
He owes a lot of money, he said,
and he needs time to find it.
My persuasion will get him this extra time,
along with my innocent face
that is the guarantee for his good intentions.
I accepted, probably due to my inherent
inclination to film noir,
knowing that I would soon regret it.
- Look, for me the cafe is... is a trap.
The trap of poetry.
The twig on the helmet that makes it look like a bush.
Camouflage.
And when the moment lands on the twig... it's ours!
- And if it does not land on our twig?
- Now, why do you do this? I know you're one of us,
I can see. Your head's boiling and you don't know it.
Good?
- And what did you say you do?
- I'm a bank robber.
- You don't look like such a tough guy to me.
- And what do I look like?
- Nothing.
- You have a sharp eye.
- It can't be. You must be doing something.
- I am... eh... I am a specialist on the general.
Artist.
- I don't believe it.
- You know, he...
- Oh, he...
- He is Laertis Varkados.
- Who?
- Laertis Varkados...? The writer...?
- I don't want you to lose your enthusiasm for Laertis,
but I've never heard of him.
- You know, the fourth edition of his
latest book is out now.
- Congratulations
- Thank you.
- And you?
- Me... these days I'm writing titles for
books I will write sometime.
- And... you make money this way?
- I survive rather out of coincidence.
- Not bad. No profession, no name...
- For you and for tonight: Great Eastern.
- Great Eastern, I'm just Sofia.
- Sofia?
As for my profession, let's be a bit ambitious.
The only profession that really suits me...
... I think is the profession of God.
- Do you need an assistant maybe?
Every morning I think that this is the
first day of my next life.
It's another day I will try not to do anything.
It's the only thing I know how to do very well.
This gives me the scientific qualification
of the "researcher of the wasted time".
OK, it doesn't make any sense,
but at least it's optimistic.
- And you? How do you survive?
- I am a stylist.
- Stylist?
- Fashion...
- You don't know what a stylist is?
- I've heard something...
- Magazines...
A lot of travelling... Do you travel?
- No.
- You're missing out.
- Maybe.
- I've just been to Monemvassia.
Have you been there?
- Never.
- Never? Abroad?
Well, what sort of life do you have
if you're not travelling?
- Tell me something, who am I now?
The asshole?
- I didn't mean anything like that.
- I don't care what you mean. Is your job to make
others feel like losers? Stylist did you say?
- Did I let you down?
- Why would you?
- Right.
You didn't let me down.
I think I do not have any professional ability.
I haven't studied anything in particular.
I read random stuff.
I read something... I understand something else...
However, I could say that I am producing a work of art.
I am wandering around the city. I should
really be subsidised by the Ministry of Culture.
Why do they pay someone to make a sculpture,
and they do not pay me to wander around the city?
Something like a moving sculpture, let's say.
This fucking country. It doesn't understand artists.
- Have a coffee.
- I had enough at the hospital.
- And these machine coffees are...
- How is the cousin?
- He is fine. His mother is shit.
The fucking doctors have filled her with psycho-drugs.
And the also drink Kalua, the oath-breakers.
- I have to admit that your cousin must be very fit.
- Yes, he's into fitness.
And the fucking doctors, the fatsos,
are taking the piss.
They're jealous because they cannot do it themselves.
- How did you take him to the hospital?
- He could not even speak.
If you break your neck, you cannot move. And they
didn't know who to take first: him or his mother?
- Such are mums, always the same.
The come in and interrupt.
- This is how he had the accident.
His mother suddenly came in. He sees her and jolts,
he makes a sudden move,
his neck breaks and he was left with
the balls in the eyes.
- What can I say?
- No, I say this was really something.
- So much exercise, in order to manage
to give himself a blowjob?
- It's a matter of concentration. It's very hard.
You have to bend your spine so much, that it hurts,
the bone spurs hurt, you strain your back...
It's very hard.
- Yes! I exercise! Is there a problem? Problem?
Oh, there is? Fuck off then! FUCK YOU!
FUCK OFF!
- And what about... girls?
- What sort of question is this?
- Sensible.
- Dunno...
- Maybe... just asking... you don't like girls?
- Dunno...
- Cut it off, tell me.
- The truth is that I don't spent much energy on sex.
- And what do you spend energy on?
- Dunno...
- Dunno, dunno... You're quite boring.
- Maybe. You?
- Me, what?
- You know...
- Dunno...
- You see? And why should I know?
- We need models. Beautiful, rich, travelling...
You don't stay with them for long.
Fly from one model to the other.
This will be my next move.
Full of promises.
Their gait embellishing anything terrible.
And you know, they've had enough
of those guys with the great bodies and the money.
Any model with self-respect
is looking for someone like me.
- God wants harmony.
Small tits, big tits, various asses.
God is fair, he doesn't fuck around.
He gave out asses and tits. With wisdom.
If you have any complaints, let him know.
You look at the magazines and you bite it all.
But these chicks just don't exist.
They are all tricks of the photographer.
Or silicones.
Or tricks of the graphic designers.
God gave breasts for breast-feeding.
Not for it to be firm.
Anything that is not functional is an anomaly.
It's a fraud. It's an abnormality of beauty.
And they make us, normal women, freak out.
But no, enough! The only losers are men.
And they should come to their senses
as soon as possible, otherwise mankind is at risk.
- I have the impression that you never relax.
- If I relax, I will lose my style.
- Yes but, you may become more charming... maybe.
- And what do I have to gain with charm?
- Hmm... make women fall in love with you...
- I prefer to fall in love with them.
- So, you are above all this?
- No, no... It just annoys me to hear "I love you".
You know, it's very manipulative.
It is hiding a question: Do you love me?
One says "I love you" to ask for a bill, to ask
if you love him back... it is very manipulative.
- I think you shouldn't analyse it so much.
- Excuse me... may I?
- Sorry...
- It's not that I analyse it, it's that I talk
about them. Maybe I shouldn't talk.
- But you're a good speaker.
- Thank you very much... but I'm not always.
- Pity.
- Pity I'm not a good speaker?
- No, you are.
- Merci.
- I talk a lot, eh?
- It's OK
- And I only say half of what I think.
- Imagine if you said it all...
- I thought you would say I'm always a good speaker,
but it's OK. Forget about it.
- You're always a good speaker!
- Merci.
- Everything OK?
- My baby!
- I hail you, glorious poet!
- I hail you, lover of adventure!
- Will you tell me what I have to do?
- Where and when?
- What where and when?
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready.
- What a voice, I love this voice!
Thanks to Manolis, I found out that
public phones can accept calls,
so I stopped worrying about my unpaid bills.
Any friend knows that in order to find me, it is
enough to arrange an appointment at my favourite booth.
The truth is that I went somewhat unprepared.
I would tell them that Manolis was having some
difficulties, but he'd certainly return their money.
But if they asked me why didn't he come himself?
Or who am I and why do I interfere?
I wonder why Manolis chooses me in such cases, while
he's aware of my total lack of ability to build a plan.
- Is it him?
- It's not him.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
- What do we do now?
- Do not exhaust yourself. Concentrate.
- And you?
- What about me?
- Do you not have to concentrate too?
- We will both concentrate.
- And him?
- Relax. Can you not relax? You have to learn to relax,
otherwise you're not doing anything. Agree?   - Right.
- And now he will speak. Speak!
- Speak!
- Speak! Speak! Are you not going to speak?
- Why don't you speak?
- And what can you say?
- He spoke!
- And what did he say?
- I don't know, he'll say it now.
- Manolis sent me. He said there is a problem,
and he asks if you could please...
- Enough! The job stinks. Break his head!
- He told me to tell you...
- I want to talk to you.
The money you gave me for karate...
I joined the ballet class.
- Maki, what are you talking about?
We will ruin our career! We are at risk!
- You're playing a nasty game, sir. Let's go.
Finally, it was easier that I expected.
- I don't like karate!
Manolis will be delighted.
His investment on my innocent face
was absolutely successful.
Organised crime was beaten by my power of persuasion,
but also from Makis' love for ballet.
- I don't like karate!
- Tell me something poetic.
Poetry, only poetry.
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk, talk, talk...
Talk to me about poetry.
I have decided to leave something behind when I die.
So, I want poetry to be a significant part of my life.
We have to make money.
Listen, listen to the wind, listen, listen, listen...
to the slow falling softly...
... the snow falling softly.
- But... but it is summer.
- Time passes quickly, though, isn't it?
- Merry Christmas!
In the arms of Santa Claus, the wind is blowing away
the slow that falls softly...
... poetry, only poetry and a scream.
Just before time passes quickly and definitively.
After all, if you asked me to describe Manolis,
he'd be a Christmas story, in the heart of the summer.
In the empty tram buses,
I hear the silence of the crowd...
... a silence full of the desire to fly,
without having anywhere to fly to.
Sometimes I think that seventy years later, someone
may stand in a similar, empty tram bus...
... and listen to the silence of the crowd.
Yes, but it will not be the same silence.
It will be the silence of another crowd.
It won't be us.
- One day!
- Tomorrow.
- No, tomorrow and a day!
This one day is the key to success.
- The day after tomorrow!
- Under no circumstances should you
call her immediately.
She gave you her number,
so you are the one setting the rules.
- I will torture her. I will call her after three days.
- And why don't you call her after two weeks?
To tell her that you happened to find her number in
your papers, ask her where you met,
because you don't remember her very well...
... and if you can, ask her to describe herself to you.
- And if all goes well up to that point,
I will press her to remember if I have fucked her.
- You dominate the game!     -Me?
- You dominate the game!
- I dominate the game!
I will exterminate her!
- Hail!
- I'm not sure, but
when I was younger I was full of certainties.
Now, as time passes,
I start doubting about more and more things.
Normally, it should be the opposite, I think.
- I don't know. Sometimes I think that...
everything I live is stories lived by someone else.
Maybe I dreamt it... something like this.
- Ah, this is dangerous. You have invested a lot on your dreams.
- You, what dreams do you have?
- The truth is I don't have any. I get bored and forget them.
- You are cynical.        - No...
- Have you always been like this?
- I assume that I used to be a sweet boy.
- And what was the sweet boy dreaming of?
- I don't remember, I really don't.
I don't remember what I was dreaming as a kid.
- No way!
- Everyone says this.
- What did you want to be when you'd grow up?
- Just for a moment, I think I wanted not to be a man.
- Hmm... I don't like this...
- Look, if it's going to become silly, I'd better stop.
- OK, don't get angry...
- No, I will.
- OK, do. But tell me. You didn't want to become a man.
What did you want to become?
- Something new.
Something that I would discover myself.
- Did you make it?
- ... and I start chatting to him, there at the bar.
I tell him how fucking great his name, Tolis, is.
He pulls my leg about the banality of "Thanassis".
Anyway, he asked me what I do.
I didn't answer, so as not to make him feel bad.
Then he asked me if I'm fucking any good pussy,
because, he said, he's having trouble with a tart.
No, he said "little tart".
And now he has a date with an amazing pussy
that has stood him up.
And then, oh God, appears...
what a defeat... what an elimination...
... a model.
The hope for a better world.
For a better future.
The hope of mankind.
With a guy called "Tolis"...
... who glanced at me discreetly, to go away...
... and I left.
- And he comes in the bar where I'm sitting with Tolis,
and he sits opposite, in a very provocative manner.
And they greet each other.
And they greet each other.
"Where do you know him?", I ask Tolis.
"Ah, don't look at him like this. He is a writer
and journalist. He was in England for years."
I can't utter a word, and then he fires the final shot:
"Very sophisticated guy, he was 3 years in Sarajevo."
Then I got this wild pleasure. A sweet taste in the mouth.
"My Tolis", I say. "This man, so to speak, there,
has graduated from KORELKO (private college)...
... he has worked as a pizza boy and as an insurer.
Also, I forgot to mention, he is my corruptor
and my last 11-year relationship."
How sweet it is to work for the devil!
Tolis turned red, but very calmly
went up to him, he told him something...
You should have seen him next to each other.
Nature with your sins! Nature with your injustice!
Then Tolis came back, alone, and said something like
"I hate assholes who think they can fool me..."
I joined the gym, did I tell you?
- Thanks
- I want to tell you something.
But don't take it the wrong way.
- I cannot promise that.
- It doesn't matter, I will say it anyway.
I cannot understand when you are
talking seriously and when you are taking the piss.
- Me neither.
- Yes, but...
- It is, it's my personal tragedy.
- But then...
- Please, it's a mystery.
- Could you perhaps solve another mystery for me?
- For the last two minutes,
you're touching your foot to my foot.
- Are you making a move on me?
- Very nice meeting you. Goodnight.
- I'm sorry. I'M SORRY!
On my radio screen,
all the cities I've dreamt of are waiting for me.
Baghdad, Prague, New Orleans...
They send their sounds, through medium waves,
and clouds of noise.
It's one of those old radios,
from when all journeys outside the city were too far...
... even impossible.
Then, just with a move of the needle,
you were going from Athens to Baghdad, 
and with and even softer move,
from Baghdad to Tangier.
Perhaps in another part of the world,
on another screen,
someone is listening to Athens through the noise.
Such a distant city for him...
... just as distant it is for me.
- I told you, screw them. We have them.
Do you know who I saw the other day?
Vassoula. Plastered with fat. Full of shit.
As if she was buried in it.
Who? Vassoula.
The one everyone had a hard on for, in high school.
Everyone was jerking off for her.
Those inside and those outside the school.
Do you know what it is to be in the second grade
of high school and be in love?
How can you know? Do you?
I felt like taking a compressor, a spade, whatever...
a compressor, even better...
To set her free from her fat.
From her misery. From the misery they imprisoned her in.
To steal her! To marry her!
Do you know what it is to be in the second grade
of high school and be in love?
How can you know?
Manolis has no talent in convincing.
He just knows how to hypnotise.
- Will he come?
- He'll surely come.
- What makes you so sure?
- Look in here!
What do you see?
Leave it. I'll tell you what you see.
I have all my teeth. From the day I was born,
I never lost one. And you know why?
Listen to it, in your face, sir.
I came all this way because of my iron discipline.
All my life I've been saying this.
Courage, my friend. Honour thy father and thy mother.
And above all, tradition.
- Tradition.
- What do you think? That I am self-made?
- Let's go. This fucker does not understand anything.
- Well done, Makis! Let's go.
I'm wondering what they are thinking about me.
- You're playing a nasty game, sir.
- No risk.
We all have the need to feel something is happening,
especially when nothing is.
Nice guys. With a somewhat dancing gait.
- I'm a collector.
But not like those ones collecting old cars,
juke boxes...
I collect the wildest and amazing of things.
Moments.
- And how does this work?
- It is a very special and strange process.
If, for example, I record the sound of your steps now,
an you listen to it after forty years...
... when your gait will be old
and very different from that of your youth.
Then it will have a huge value.
And I will have preserved it.
I collect telephone messages,
notes on napkins... "the food's in the kitchen"...
- What is the meaning in this?
- This one I smoked myself, at a moment in my life
when I had to make a very important decision.
I never found hers.
Can I keep this?
- Why?
- Because you're probably going to make
a very important decision.
- And what's the point in this?
- This, you'll find out in a few years.
- It's yours.
I don't know what decision he meant,
what is important is that he really meant it.
Vasso!
Vasso!
Vassoula! (Little Vasso)
Vassoula!
- Your dream?
- For today, it's you.
- Right...
- It's the first time you seem awkward.
- Probably this is what that boy was like.
- Probably.
- Well, I won't insist. I don't want to push you.
I don't want to become a nightmare.
- Nightmares are good for me, they wake me up.
FRIDAY
- So, dear Telis. You ought to know that this
is the decade of the answering machine.
A correct message, a correct phone call,
can take you to heaven.
While a wrong one, to absolute hell.
Imagine, also, that she may be playing your massage
to her friends to take the piss.
- I say I should call her from my mobile, for "glamour"
- No, my Telis! No, my boy. Leave the mobile.
I want you simple, uncomplicated, Doric.
It all up to the voice. ALL!
And it should be made clear from the first moment
that you don't need her answer.
You are a hobbyist.
I want a deep, sensual voice. To pierce her body.
And no details, who you are etc.
She remember you. She ought to remember you!
Go on! Call her now.
Give her the gift of this experience.
And no details, Telis.
She ought to remember you!
- This is Litsa. Leave a message.
- Yes, hello... I am...
I can't do it.
Just by hearing her voice, I feel inferior.
- Think of her anxiety when she hears your
unfinished message.
Give her another chance. Call her again.
So that she can hear this wonderful voice.
- This is Litsa. Leave a message.
- Yes, this is Telis...
I can't.
- Didn't we say she remembers you?
You do not allow yourself not to be remembered!
And you said your name. Wrong!
Call her again! Play with your victim!
Carnivorous monster!
Tiger!
Hobbyist!
- This is Litsa. Leave a message.
- Yes, I am Telis, the one you know, call me
on my number 0944956724. Call me!
- Direct, simple, Doric, plain!
Hobbyist.
- It was not so hard after all.
- You convinced her, my boy.
With your voice and simplicity.
- This is Litsa. Leave a message.
- Litsa, as you understand, it's Telis.
I say, today that the moon is full, and the candles are burning only for us...
... we should meet by the sea, on a quiet beach...
- Telis?
- Litsa?
- Don't even think about calling again.
- Did you seduce her?
Did you smash her mercilessly, hobbyist?
- Not even think about calling her again.
- At least you were not left with the doubt.
- So, this is what you meant when you were saying
that you know people of the night?
- What did you think? Some gay barmen?
I know key people.
- And you're being literal.
- Although I'm rarely literal,
I'm making an exception for you.
He always has with him the keys of
all the shops in the area.
- Oh, the key guard then...
- What?           - No, nothing.
So, will he give us the keys?
- Our aim is clearly artistic, so he should be moved.
- He's original, if nothing else. With his bike...
- I told you, I will impress you.
- You will impress me if you keep your promises.
Not to talk.
- Yes, but in order not to speak, I have to be
in the appropriate environment. The kingdom of silence.
- A security guy, with a bike,
who will give us the key for the kingdom of silence.
After all, you impressed me.
- I should have warmed up more.
You think I didn't tell him? I did.
He lost it, he started shouting...
"You'll talk to me about exercise?
You, that you've never moved your ass...
I'll tell you what to do,
and if you don't like it, bye-bye."
This is what he said. Bye-bye.
What could I say? Now he has disappeared.
He took me to the hospital and disappeared.
He didn't even wait for the X-rays.
- I could not do otherwise. I had to attack him.
In the end, there was only two punches.
I mean, I got them.
Yesterday, I turned thirty and went to see her.
He was there, too.
Calm, handsome, cool.
I attacked him.
All these days in bed, I was wondering how I got here.
I remember when I was eighteen...
I was thinking how I would be at thirty.
I could see myself as something.
What I am now, where I am now,
I could not even imagine.
And just as time passed and I became thirty,
I will also become forty.
And then another Tolis will be there
to give me a couple of punches.
It look like it's the only way for times to change.
What can you say?
I don't know.
- Tell me a story.
-What kind of story would you like to hear?
- A love story.
- All love stories are the same.
Part one: You are everything to me.
Part two: Be everything for me.
Part three: You again?
- That was a very brief love story.
- Like this rain.
- Shall we go?
- You are a kind man.
I dreamt of you last night.
Birds... fluttered through your hair.
And then, a quiet rain.
Shut up!
Birds... fluttered through your hair.
And then, a quiet rain.
You are a kind man.
But we are starting to lose our temper!
Tell him that now he will wait for us!
It looks like my mission is over.
Manolis will probably have to find new ways.
I don't know if I made it or not.
And after all, what difference does it make?
What may be important,
is that I will never see them again.
I wonder, will Makis dedicate his life to ballet?
And will his ruthless boss dream of me again?
Birds... fluttering through my hair.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Will you make us coffee?
- Sure.
- I will have a double Greek coffee.
- And French coffee for me.
- The sun is rising.
- Your coffee.
- Good?
- Yes.
- It's a shame you always come here alone.
- I cannot do otherwise.
- Why?
- Because, when I come here...
... I come because I need
to look at the city from above.
And I know that when I feel this need...
... the moment approaches to make
an important decision.
And as you know, we should be alone when
we are making important decisions.
Mate, change the music! We'll fall asleep.
- Can you stop talking?
- It's not as easy as you think.
- Listen, cover my eyes.
Cover my eyes.
Come on.
And listen.
- We'd better leave before the day starts.
- It's better this way...we'll have had only one night.
But not even a kiss?
- There is no time.
- It can be done now.
- I just remembered what I wanted to be
when I was a kid.            - Tell me!
- I wanted to do something very useful for mankind.
To bring a rock from the Moon.
- A specific rock?
- Of course, a specific one!
- I'd seen it next to an astronaut's foot, in a photo,
and felt that this rock should come to Earth.
- How are you going to separate?
- Just like we met.
And as for the rock, I know why I'll bring it.
To give it to you!
It's been a week and four days
and I haven't seen you again.
A week and four days divided among
coffees, boxers, dancers...
underground arcades with dodgy guys, Manolis' madness,
the loneliness of waking up in the morning.
Tonight, in order to celebrate
the happy end of our collaboration,
Manolis decided to invest
his last money on two whores.
Of course, what may two whores have to do with
Manolis' melodramatic ways?
What difference does it make?
- I don't know why, but what I remember best is when
some monsters have come into the spaceship...
... and they have transformed into the men of the crew.
They... wanted to steal the fuel from Enterprise.
- Isn't this where the monsters had
something like tentacles?
Like ropes?
With a huge eye on top.
And only the captain could see them.
- Yes, that was it.
- It is strange... This is the episode
everyone remembers from Star Trek.
- It is very strange, what our memory chooses to keep.
- I like teletransportation.
From planet to planet...
- Me too.
- i liked Spock.
- Do you remember when we were all going to Stadium,
the billiards?
You know, Stadium, that belonged to Fournarakis.
Because the had colour TV,
so that we could watch Star Trek.
Mrs Zoula was also coming there.
And she was always very sad.
For Spock. For his ears.
"Look at the poor boy.
How will he ever get a job in another TV serial..."
And Fournarakis would come to comfort her,
and he would say: "Don't worry, Mrs Zoula,
he's from another planet."
And Mrs Zoula, very wise lady, would say:
"So what, all planets are the same."
Do you think we may be extraterrestrial, too?
Very strange.
- So, how does Star Trek end?
- Did it end?
- Like all nice journeys.
They were lost in space.
- Beautiful ending.
- A grand finale.
- Why can we not see the stars?
- The city lights are masking them.
- And we are they not turning them off?
- People are afraid.
They prefer a bright city.
- What will happen, boys?
Are you going to fuck us, so we can go?
- I could have become a great actress.
Don't laugh or I'll stop, OK?
In first year, I was playing Medea
and you hairs would stand right up with my mourning.
Everyone was crying.
Anyway, in second year a guy came and he told me
"Come play in Epidavros"
... that girl who is mourning for her brother,
who she buried, I don't remember exactly...
And then I saw this is not what he wanted from me.
And what to do? On that moment I decided to become
a whore. Because...
I thought that, why should I go to Epidavros,
and get screwed for free?
No, love. I respect archaeological sites.
- We have to go.
We don't have time.
- It's always late, baby.
- Goodnight.
- Guys, can I give you some advice?
Women like charming men,
men that don't talk much.
Talk less, and fuck more.
It will do you good.
Goodnight.
- Why didn't we eat anything?
- This is the latest cigarette end in my collection.
And I'm very proud of it.
The only female among all these male ones.
This one is also female, but without lipstick -
very disappointed.
A woman gave it to me today, after she smoked,
telling me about a night she spent with a man.
Of course, nothing is given for free.
It is my reward for a favour she asked.
Believe me, she was a very generous woman.
I have something to ask from you.
Are you ready?
- I DONT WANT TO FUCK!
I WANT TO RELAX!
Manolis disappeared, just the way he appeared.
Suddenly, like a storm.
It looks like things are getting tough for him.
The guys in the arcade said it clearly.
"Tell him that now he will be waiting for us."
Yes. But he was waiting only for Vassoula.
And I close my eyes.
And through the crowd, comes a sea.
And through the sea come the fluttering of the birds.
And through the fluttering, you will come.
Let me impress you.
