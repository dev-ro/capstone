Late September.
The Warsaw Uprising is
nearing its tragic finale.
The towns of Riverside,
Czerniakow and Sadyba
have fallen
long ago.
The downtown areas of
Zoliborz and Mokotow,
cut off and surrounded by
German forces, are in flames.
This company
now numbers 43.
Three days ago,
there were 70.
This is their commanding
officer, Lieutenant "Splinter".
He recruited these men, and
is responsible for them.
His second-in-command,
Lieutenant "Wise",
drilled discipline into these
boys with an iron hand
And the messenger
girl, Halinka.
Leaving home, she promised
her mother she would keep warm.
They've most likely all made
the same promise.
All mothers
are alike.
Sergeant Major "Bullet",
has perfect hand-writing,
and carries all of
the records in his case.
Officer Cadet "Bearing"
dreams of his daily bath.
But the 3rd Platoon
has bigger troubles.
"Slim", Bearing's aide,
dreams of building
airplanes after
the war.
And finally, the artist.
He's not a soldier,
and only turned
up yesterday.
These are the
tragic heroes.
Watch them closely, since these
are the last hours of their lives.
Hi, Splinter,you're
right on time.
Were you hit?
A strong wind.
What's the situation?
As you see.
The Stukas came.
The Germans tried to
break through three times.
We're lucky that they
sleep at night.
You won't have a fun time
here, tomorrow.
Maybe a fun death.
We'll try to stay here for a while.
I'd like to stay
here, too.
What, until
Judgement Day?
We'll be hailed
by future generations.
They won't
take us alive.
Precisely.
The Polish way.
What's wrong? You've
always been so strong.
I've had enough, understand?
What am I supposed to tell
my men? They trust me.
You're losing it.
There's no time to think here.
Bartek almost abandoned
his position today.
As if he had
somewhere to go.
It's getting
more and more cramped.
They want to finish
Mokotow off,
and get started
on downtown.
Damn, I can't believe it's the
56th day of the Uprising.
It's hell...
Yes, that's always
an option...
We know each other.
You gave these to me
on the first day.
Do they fit?
Of course. To think that they
might pull them off my corpse.
But I see you've
joined the Uprising.
What does your mother
think of that?
She's dead.
Is your wound bad?
No, it's nothing.
It's too bad that you...
Excuse me, is there a
telephone anywhere nearby?
There will be.
Can I call
Rakowiecka Street?
Are you crazy?
The Germans are there.
I know, but...
I live there.
Please let me call,
all right?
Go see the commander.
That way?
Living in Warsaw must have been nice!
A bourgeois living room.
Absolutely horrible.
We have pistols and
hand grenades,
versus tanks
and airplanes.
When the hell
are we ever going to learn?
Orders are orders.
No sense in rationalizing.
Bearing!
Sir?
Post some sentries,
and send out a patrol.
Yes, sir.
I need six volunteers.
Yes, sir!
Yes sir!
I have a special
assignment for you.
Hold on for a minute.
You're a composer, right?
Yes.
Play something nice,
we have a piano.
But, l...
Come on...
Christ, a Bechstein!
Take that goddamned
thing off.
La Comparsita would
be much better,
or something like it.
I dreamt of you today,
Halinka.
We were
dancing a tango, and...
Well?
What's new?
Please, Lieutenant.
You promised me a gun.
I want to be armed.
Everyone has something...
That's it?
I was hoping it would be a Luger.
Oh, a Luger? It would
knock you off your feet.
This is perfect for you.
You can kill from six feet way.
Take it.
Stop that noise. Play
something... with some feeling.
I could get you a real gun,
instead of that cap gun.
Cap gun? And why
do you keep your antique?
Is everything clear?
Yes, sir!
Don't take unnecessary risks.
Can I phone home,
in Rakowiecka?
My family
should be there.
Can l
use that telephone?
Just ask them to connect us
to number 40218
All right, hold on.
Let's give it a try.
This is
Splinter. Are you still alive?
You don't have any
window panes?
I've forgotten what
they look like.
You're lucky that
you have a roof.
Listen, can you try
number 40218?
No, on the German side.
Rakowiecka.
We want to check if
there's anyone there.
Okay, I'll wait.
They're saying that there's no
one there anymore.
Wanda?
Wanda?
Wanda?
It's me, Michael.
What's happening
over there?
I've been looking
for you...
With the resistance.
I've joined one of the units.
I don't know how,
but it's still going...
What about you?
Evacuating?
Wanda...
My God!
Zosia.
Zosia.
Zosienka, it's me,
Daddy.
Zosia.
Zosia.
Wanda...
Hallo! Wanda!
Jesus.
They got cut off.
All sentries are
in place, sir.
Thank you.
Slim!
What am l
supposed to do now?
Go and get
some rest.
Everybody get ready
for supper!
Halinka, let's find
a place to sleep.
Lieutenant. Lieutenant, sir!
I don't have any records
of Bearing's platoon.
Don't bother me
with your records.
It's going to
start soon.
We must keep records, sir.
They're going to depend on them.
They'll depend on them.
That's for sure.
But stop
bothering me now!
Slim! Can you
see anything?
Nothing. The potato-diggers
have just returned.
Only the devil knows
if the potatoes
will do them
any good.
If they
send any more Stukas,
even the ruins will be destroyed.
Are you ready,
Bearing?
They 'll begin by
eight for sure.
I'm going to shave first.
I have ten ammo clips.
How old are
you, Bearing?
23.
At that age, life
doesn't seem so precious.
You know,
these are the final days.
I know, but we'll make
them bleed first.
Is Daisy
back yet?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Do you know how
to use that? Careful!
Are you crazy?
It's easy.
Just be careful.
I'm going. The Germans are
finishing their breakfast.
What are you playing?
It's out of tune.
Too many aspiring musicians here.
I'm going.
Just don't go crazy. It'd be a
pity to lose an artist.
What do you know?
Oh, sorry.
That's all right.
Come in.
What's this about?
You should get up.
Now's not the time
for lovemaking.
You're speaking
to an officer.
Now is precisely the time
for it. We're in love.
And how's Daisy?
Jacek, I'm here.
I don't stink, do l?
Because I left my shoes
in the hallway.
You should keep out
of those sewers.
You were supposed to
be back by yesterday.
Were you worried
about me?
I stopped worrying
long ago,
but Splinter was asking
about you.
Are you jealous?
Me? Forget it!
You, on the other
hand, spare no one.
I only smiled at Splinter,
and nothing else.
It looked as if you had
a soft spot for him.
That's just
the way I am.
That's not
a good thing.
You should've stayed
downtown,
with those
friends of yours.
They're going
to finish us.
I know.
Look at what
I brought you.
Real English tea,
and cigarettes.
You know I don't smoke?
Where did you
get them, anyway?
From my aunt.
Your aunt...
Jacek, I came back just
for you.
Me? That's interesting. Why?
Well, why?
Why? Because I'm your messenger.
Did you know that the main
attack will be here?
Stop shaving,
will you.
Wash up, because you stink.
Sun tanning
in the nude?
I spent all of July
in Zalesie.
I came back to Warsaw
on August 1st.
Only God
knows why...
Did you stay with your
aunt in Zalesie, too?
It's beginning.
Get out of here,
dammit!
Are you crazy?
Keep firing!
Left machine gun,
fire lower!
Look out!
Hello?
Hello, Bartek!
Great, both phones are dead!
They're going to come
from behind. Zephyr?
Yes, sir!
Go to H.Q.
Explain that we're holding
the red house,
and that the Germans
are near
Bartek's section.
We need a counter attack,
or else they'll cut
us off. Go!
Did you
get all that?
Sure.
Then go!
Junk!
Useless pipe!
They'll get to us
in ten minutes.
Withdraw.
We can't stop them with our bare hands!
God damn!
That's the last
shell, Slim...
Slim actually
hit them!
A Goliath...
Stop that...
I'm all right.
Keep still.
You're not hurt?
I'm glad
you're okay.
What's happening?
What about
the platoon?
What are
the Krauts waiting for?
Is Zephyr back?
No.
They've surrounded us.
How's Bearing?
He'll live.
They've wasted my men.
Don't get
too sentimental.
The silence is making
my ears ring.
It's only a short pause.
They're scheming
on how to get us.
The front didn't work,
so they'll try the back.
Now is an easy
time to withdraw, sir.
Lieutenant, you never
smoked before. Nerves?
Fear. It's eating
through all of us.
Not me. I've been smoking
since I was a kid.
When did you join
the resistance?
In July of 1941.
Any decorations?
The Cross of Valor
for an attack on Blank...
...for
an attack on Blank Palace.
Wounded in the chest,
in the right side,
on September 26th, 1944.
Any next of kin in case of death?
Thank you.
They've found a way.
I don't understand...
I've changed my mind.
I won't build planes
after the war is over.
Splinter. Splinter!
Game is looking for you.
Something's happened.
Sir! I report that the
company is in the Red House.
Hello, Splinter.
Leave us, Zephyr.
Losses?
12 dead.
10 critically wounded.
You'll be leaving
here at dusk.
We're going downtown.
What? How?
Which way?
Through the sewers.
I'm not going.
Are you crazy?
The are only a few
streets left.
Anyway, they're going to finish
us off by tomorrow.
I'm not going.
All that blood that was shed,
just so that we can
run away like rats?
The sewers?
How can I face my men?
It's an order, Splinter.
Screw your orders!
You're a damned civilian,
after all.
Don't you want to
rescue your men?
They trusted me.
We all trusted someone.
Here... this is your
pass to the sewers.
Take care, Splinter.
Gentlemen, why is it so
quiet in here? For God's sake!
So play a record
on the gramophone.
Stop that.
Stop that.
Maybe I should play
an entire symphony.
Here, you can try.
On this thing?
Smart ass...
Listen up, kids.
Good news.
What is it?
Reinforcements?
We're going downtown,
through the sewers.
What do you mean?
We're leaving here?
We can't hold Mokotow.
There are only
a few streets left.
They'll crush us.
Hear that, guys?
We've been fighting in
this coffin for nothing!
It's an order
from headquarters.
Nothing.
A void.
All I'm doing is making
up hollow sounds.
Don't drink
anymore, please.
I'm impotent, understand?
A pitiful hireling.
That's the real tragedy.
Please, don't drink.
I'm glad this misery
is ending.
Give it to me,
I want some, too.
He loves you, the handsome
trooper, doesn't he?
Is he you first?
I feel like we won't
live through this night.
It's easier to die
when you're in love.
That's nonsens!
Melodrama!
Don't get carried away.
Make room for the
company commander!
Drink Splinter.
You've gone mad.
Halinka, haven't you?
I'm not drinking.
I'm listening to music.
Music? So now you all
feel like hearing music?
And you're the one
who's playing?
That's because this will
be the last time!
Drink, Splinter. It'll be easier to
walk through the sewers.
So this is your
sense of discipline?
At your post until the end!
Only dead drunk!
It's a long way
to downtown.
There's plenty of time
to sober up.
What'll we
do downtown?
We'll keep fighting.
Keep fighting? They'll
crush us all like bed bugs.
There's not going to be
anything left of this city.
Shut up! Can't you even
die like a man?
On the contrary. Now l
finally know how to die!
Company roll call.
Yes, sir. But now it's a platoon
and not a company.
Don't anyone even dare
fart once we've started.
Absolute silence, like
in a family tomb.
Otherwise, the Germans
will cut us down.
If anyone is frightened, come
to me, and I'll hold his hand.
Come on,
cheere up!
Attention!
All present and accounted
for, sir, and ready to depart!
Two officers, five N.C.O.'s,
and twenty others.
You're drunk! This is
not the time for drills.
Thank you.
At ease! Forward march!
Can you make it,
Bearing?
I'll go.
Here, give that to me.
Let me try, I'm not
risking much.
He needs
two strong men.
I'll take care of him,
you don't need to worry.
It's better if you
come with me.
You can show us
the way.
That way is
pretty easy.
Please, let me go
with Bearing.
Wise, give us some
cover fire!
Tiger tanks.
This is the
last barricade.
Get in to sewers,
friend.
Lieutenant, may I respectfully
report that it's our turn...
Report respectfully
into the hole.
Why you little...
Sir, have you seen my
daughter? She's blonde...
Let's go!
Gentlemen, wait!
Please wait!
My daughter, blonde,
tall in a brown coat.
Please wait!
Gentlemen!
What's happened?
Crap!
Oh, God, the acoustics
are amazing!
"l see a land of heavy
dreams and shadows."
Stop the chit-chat and
get a move on, Maestro!
Quiet! The orders were, no talking!
I'm too tall for...
Goddamn it.
You're better
off, Halinka.
Gas! Gas!
Wise, let's turn back.
There's gas ahead.
The Germans must be
up there already.
We have to catch up to the company.
Stop!
The Germans have released gas!
Is this the way back?
I think so.
Anyway, who knows?
All the sewers look alike!
I'm from Old Town.
I've had enough
of these sewers,
and this stupid game
of hide and seek!
Go back, there's gas!
People, where
are you going?
Guys!
My head's spinning.
It must be the gas.
Jacek, it's your fever.
There's no gas here.
We're never going to
catch up.
Maybe we should
call Michael?
There's no need to,
I know this sewer.
It's not difficult. We'll make
it slowly by ourselves.
Daisy, I'm going to
rest for a minute.
Keep going, damn you!
Jacek, keep going.
We'll rest at home.
At home? Does anyone
still have a home?
You're really strong, Daisy,
as if you were a laborer
I've never been
a laborer.
You know, I don't know
anything about you.
We fought in the
resistance together.
I know that,
Daisy, but...
You want me to tell you
my life story now?
Is it a long story?
Longer than this sewer.
Keep going.
Jacek!
What's that?
Look...
Is it a lamp
at the crossing? Or...
Maybe the Germans?
They wouldn't dare
come down here.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Jacek, it's just a normal candle.
This is the first barricade.
You can rest here.
Well help me lift a wounded man!
What are you staring at?
Quiet! You dumb
son of a bitch!
It's allready seven.
It's already day up there.
Call Lieutenant Wise.
Lieutenant Wise, report
to Lieutenant Splinter.
Lieutenant Wise, report
to Lieutenant Splinter.
Gas! Gas! Gas!
It's going to be
extremely difficult
maintaining discipline
here,Lieutenant.
But we have to try and
keep control. What's next?
Let's wait for Wise.
We can't leave them behind.
Damned matches!
It's not the
matches, sir.
There are so many
feet stirring this crap.
Fumes are being released.
That's what's killing us,
and not the grenades.
I used to dabble in chemistry.
Don't you feel weak, Lieutenant?
No.
But, there's no
oxygen in the air.
Let's get out
of here, Lieutenant.
Well, Lieutenant? Do we let
the men die like this?
Is that my fault?
Why isn't Wise here, yet?
Call him!
Don't sit down!
It's worst near the water!
You won't be able to get up.
Let's go, Lieutenant.
We can't stay here.
I'm going to go, then,
to call them.
Lieutenant Wise says that
we should go ahead.
They stopped
so that Bearing could rest.
Daisy knows the way.
They'll catch up to us.
Let's go, Lieutenant.
Let's go, guys.
Slow down, Wise.
Faster, faster!
Splinter is probably
out on Aleje Street by now.
Give me the flask.
You're going to get weaker.
Give it to me,
come on!
You want some?
Sure. It's cold.
I've lost all my strength.
Enough already.
It's the Waters of Lethe.
River of Oblivion.
An ordinary homemade brew,
but it makes you feel better.
Did you hear those sounds?
Come on, Artist,
hurry up!
Christ! What is that?
Wise!
Jesus! Jesus!
Are you okay, Halinka?
Witold! Where are you?
Where's my child?
Shut up! Shut up,
damned woman!
You've sold us out!
Murderers!
"There, in the depths of the pit,
as we stand,
I see the people in a river of excretion
that seems to be the overflow
of the world's toilets."
What are you talking
about, Michael?
Not l, but Dante.
Get down here at once!
You'll draw the Germans' attention!
Faster!
Wise. Let's save ourselves!
I'm scared...
Stop whining!
Don't you think I want to
get out of here? Let's go back.
You look bad, Jacek.
You can shave when we're out.
I don't care.
You must be very ill.
What's that?
Raining?
That's rain... Quiet.
Don't cry, child.
Listen to that.
Don't you hear...
Everything 's singing.
Yeah, and maybe you're
seeing angels, also?
Get up! Keep going!
Don't stop!
Hear that?
Listen!
Nonsense!
It's just the water!
I can hear it!
Finally, I can hear it!
Do you?
I can hear it!
Shut up!
Damn you!
What's with you?
Have you lost it?
Ridiculous little man.
How could you understand?
Come back!
Don't be an idiot!
Stop, or I'll shoot!
I order you to come
back at once!
Wise...
Why am I so weak?
We're not going to
reach downtown, anyway.
There's no way.
This damned sewer
has to end somewhere!
Let's go.
What is that?
Probably a wounded man.
Could that really
be a human voice?
Let's keep going.
Sir, we can't make anything
out of those noises.
I'll go see what it is.
Wait here.
I found your noise-maker.
A man. Let's get out
of here, sir.
I know him. He's a
Colonel from Headquarters.
Which one of you
will carry him?
What's the matter?
Forward march!
Where... where is
that sign?
There should be a sign
for Wilcza Street
somewhere to the left.
We should have brought Daisy
along. She knows the way.
Daisy is helping Bearing,
and we know how to read.
I can't take
this, Lieutenant.
Let get out of here,
or we might be here forever.
There are no signs.
Call the men, Bullet.
Yes, sir!
Get up!
The Lieutenant is waiting!
Go on ahead.
Wait a few minutes.
I'm feeling weak.
We can rest for a bit.
There!
There should be
a sign here... Wilcza.
No, there's no sign.
Well?
They're close behind us.
Hold on to me, Splinter.
I've had enough of this.
All you have to do
is keep moving your legs.
Daisy...
aren't you tired?
Wh should I be tired?
I'm not wounded.
It's calm and misty.
We're taking a walk through
a dark and fragrant forest.
We're stumbling
through stinking shit.
You're always
straight to the point, Daisy.
I don't think you could
ever fall in love. Could you?
Keep moving those
legs of yours,
or we won't get
there for three days.
You have a fever,
and we'll die of hunger, here.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
What's that?
He was old. He probably
died during the gas panic.
Stupid people, never been
in the sewers before.
I don't see anything.
There it is, guys!
The sign!
I... Iove...
Jacek.
Oh, God.
My head's spinning.
I think there's gas in the air.
Look at the fog.
You're a child, Jacek.
The fever's making you see things.
Wait, this is our sewer.
See it? Wilcza.
I wouldn't have
noticed it.
I can barely see now.
Let's go up there!
Give me your hand.
Your hand...
Hold on to me!
Jacek!
I can't go up that pipe!
I can't reach it.
Daisy, go by yourself.
You idiot!
You can't pull me up there, Daisy.
You should go
and get help.
I'll just rest
here and wait.
Look there's a sign over there.
Large letters...
I love...
We have to save
the batteries.
There's a sign there.
What does it say?
I love... Janek.
Who could have written
such nonsense?
It's not nonsense.
An empty sewer.
The Germans high above.
It's fear, you know?
Someone wrote that.
It made them feel better.
I used to pass
though here, too.
And what did you write?
Kiss my ass...
What?
...and other things like that.
And who's this Janek?
A guy that some girl loved.
Loved him a lot?
Yeah, she loved him a lot,
Jacek. Come on, let's go.
No, we won't get there, Daisy.
I'll just wait and rest here.
You'll come back with help,
won't you?
Get up!
No.
I must have imagined it...
My head is spinning so much.
I even hear music.
Must be the fever...
Wait, I can really hear it.
Who was that?
Is he crazy, or am l?
He is!
He's been crazy
for some time now,
don't you remember?
How strange!
I don't remember.
Michael.
Michael!
Michael!
Come back!
Quiet. He can't
hear anything.
Jacek, stop this whining,
and let's go!
I won't make it up there,
but I want to live.
Alright, Jacek,
don't worry, you'll live.
We'll go straight
that way.
The sewer should run
into the Vistula pretty soon.
It's dry here. There's got
to be an exit nearby.
Turn on the flashlight.
The battery's
almost dead.
We'll get there anyway.
No.
It's not possible!
I don't have
any strength left.
There's no way we're ever
getting out of here. It's over.
Over?
What do you mean?
It can't be over!
I have someone to live for!
I'm right here.
Who do you have to live for?
What are you talking about?
My wife and my child!
A wife and a child? How funny,
you've never mentioned them.
You've never worn
a wedding ring.
What?
I have it on me.
Look!
See? I have to live.
Let's go back,
up the sewer.
Hurry up, while I'm
still on my feet.
Hold on.
Turn off the light, Wise.
Get up, get up,
get up!
Daisy, I'm going to sit for a bit.
No.
I have...
I have to rest.
Jacek, we'll be at
the river soon.
I can't open my eyes.
It hurts.
Then don't.
It's the fever.
You're going to have
to go to a hospital.
Where's this hospital?
Don't you think we'll
get our lives back?
Never.
To live, Daisy.
I promised you that.
I was so rude to you...
We'll talk
about that later.
I've been bad.
I was bad.
I see some light
ahead, Jacek.
We're going to live.
Don't open your eyes.
It's really bright.
Is it much further?
I see water, Jacek.
And green grass.
Let's go there, Daisy.
You can rest now.
We go to the grass, soon.
No, don't open
your eyes because.
...because the
sun's come out.
Hands up!
The wedding ring.
Come out! Come out!
Slim, throw that damned
gun away.
You're going to kill yourself.
That stunned me...
Throw it away.
Let's get some fresh air.
Get lost!
Light!
Air, sir!
We're going to the inlet.
Tell the men, Bullet.
The inlet.
We're turning left, guys.
Going to the inlet.
They're coming, Lieutenant.
They're coming.
No good.
The exit is blocked.
