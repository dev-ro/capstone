See you, Daddy
See you
Hurry
What are you doing?
Look at the traffic!
And Vic?
Today is the first day of school! I know!
She did almost miss the first school day!
Oh no! That's horrible!
I'm going upstairs and open up.
Ok. Hey, pay attention!
Oh my god!
Was that a fish on your last delivery?
If we get that Ramous again,
I'm going to kill myself!
Guys, that was a summer!
23 in 2 months!
23 what?
Well what would you think? Discretion.
Maybe we will have de Lamarc.
She's nice. You know her?
I had her 2 years ago.
She's not so good.
That's Mr. Lehman, the German Teacher.
Hey, he's very good-looking!
Awesome!
Hey, what do you think about Caillaux?
Look, how horny he's...
Looking? Very funny..!
Over there is the 6th grade!
Common', go! Oh!
Penelope. What time you finish?
Mom said, you would wait for me.
Listen, Samantha,
I'm "babysitting" you for 10 years now!
You are in Junior High School now.
So now stop it! Got it?
You're stupid!
Do you know if seniors are eating in caffeteria?
You're new? Yes.
Let's go and ask.
Where were you before? Versailles. And you?
I was at Jules-Ferry.
I'm Penelope.
Have you read that? Not bad.
Common, hurry up!
"Why did God create Brassac?
Because he did not have enough hair to make...
...an ape."
Had this one last year.
That's a tough guy.
My name is...
He looks like King Kong.
Please sit!
Now, first we will distribute the forms.
What do you take for 2nd language?
German. And you?
I'm taking Russian.
On top: name and given name,
then your parents work, adress, telephone...
My parents are divorced.
Yeah, mine too!
Mine are not getting along so well.
Give both adresses and note,
if you live with your mother or father.
Are you the only one?
My sister is getting on my nerves.
Silence please!
Did you already went out with a boy?
I did. It was in England.
Warren was his name. Like Warren Beatty.
I'm telling you, he was awesome!
To get my English better I'm
watching 10 US movies a week.
Next Handcraft lessons!
Calm, or he will flip out.
Where is my red belt?
I have 3 extractions and a suppurating jaw to treat.
And it's 10 past 2!
Couldn't you take a day off?
I get payed only for each treatment.
Put that up there.
I'm not alone in the clinic!
If I'm not here the patients will go elsewhere.
If one day I will have...
...my own doctor's office...
Hey. That's... that's awesome!
What is that?
My cartoon:
"The evil old ones".
Thats really cool!
Those two olds with the canes
and then those movements, just great!
You really mean it?
I've already sent it to different magazines.
Vic!
Ah, that is my great grandmother!
Poupette, what are you doing here?
I'm taking you with me to
my recording session. Hop in!
See you tomorow!
Ok. Goodbye, Madame.
Hello my little girl!
Hello! Do my parents know?
Kids are undesired in house movings.
After that we will eat at "La Coupole".
How old are you now?
Thirteen.
Then there is still time.
Ah, Madame Valadier.
Hello, Mademoiselle.
Your favorite table again?
With pleasure.
Oh, Arthur!
I'm happy to see you again!
And you, Poupette.
Excellent cellist!
You know everyone here!
Sit down, my dear.
Common, sit down. Thank you, Serge.
The first time I ate here was in 1923.
Or or was it in 1925? Not so important.
I also made such big eyes like you.
Were you alone here?
With Paul Poiret, you know him?
Couturier, Pascha, Mauzen,
the natural son of Lorenzo di Medici
and Orson Wells, you understand.
Thank you. The real liberator of women.
From the corset! You took yours off?
I have never wore such a things.
Madame, a dozen oysters like always,
one steak tartar, roasted gently,
No onions. And for Mademoiselle?
A chicken fricassee.
And... a bottle of cold white wine,
Today we will get drunk.
Don't go so fast. Here they are.
I think, he looked at me.
I also wanna go to the party!
They surely don't want to invite us,
Jeanne und Caroline are already invited.
They are behind us!
I think they want to catch up.
Lets walk more slowly. More slowly...
I can't. I would have to stop walking.
Dear God, let's go talk to them.
Hey, Vic, Penelope!
Hey, wait a second!
Hi!
Hi!
I think that makes my legs look fat.
Do you have something planned for Saturday?
I'm making a "Boum". Wanna come?
A "Boum"? What's that?
A party! Are you coming?
Well... What time?
This evening. We have so many guys.
You wanna go there?
Maybe.
Here, call me. But seriously...
Tomorrow will be too late. Ok?
Bye! Bye!
We did it! We did it!
Oh, thats crazy! S o great!
Have you seen Raouls coat?
And Jean-Pierres blue eyes?!
That guy is so cool! So nice!
What is it?
What should I wear?
Mademoiselle, Monsieur Guibert is waiting for you.
Hello? Yes.
No, no, not an anti-nicotine campaign.
No, not this week.
We have the Guatemala serie.
No, no, it is out of question.
Yes, I know, more deaths caused by cancer then earthquakes.
But could we...
Yes, hello? Who?
No, there is no Madame Beretton here.
Beretton? That is me.
It is really important!
I need an answer, but before I explain
it to you, swear to say yes!
Vic, I have a meeting here.
You know that?
Can I go on a Boum this weekend?
We will discuss this later.
Please, I need to know it now!
The answer is: NO! Please, excuse me.
Shit!
Sure, they have style, a personal one, but...
Single drawings are not so good.
Such a pictures are better for newspapers.
I'm doing picture stories.
Picture stories are not our style.
You should try elsewhere.
We just publish comic-strips.
Your drawings are very intellectual.
I need more actual things.
Until tomorow?
I will have it
So, an upper jaw X-ray, I will take a
look in the morning. Good evening.
Monsieur, we still have a patient.
It is 5 past 5. Tell her to come tomorrow.
It is an inflammation.
And Dr. Chaumont is already gone?
Yes.
So, are you diabetic?
No.
Pregnant?
No.
Do you take sedatives? No.
Any allergies?
Yes. Rabbit hair.
Is everything ready?
Yes, Monsieur.
Doctor...
Open your mouth, please.
I have to go, or I'll miss my train at 5:32.
Ok, you can go.
Is it a steady pain?
Vanessa! Are you crazy?
Asshole! I'm searching for you for months.
I just wanted to go, leave...
...the easy way. Without noise.
Footsteps, doorbell ringing,
Broken glasses! Separation scenes are great...
...such a separation scene!
Common!
I have waited for this. Day after day, for 5 months!
And now I'm leaving you,
But first I will have something from you!
We wont fight at the end...
...about costs.
It's your fault, no extra costs.
You owe me something.
I'm writing it down.
You owe me a last night.
What... what do you mean?
An entire night? But...
I'm living in Paris now.
Rue Vallet 21, 6th floor, on the left.
Lets say the 26th, so you can organize it.
or should I call you, so you can confirm it?
On Rue Odeon 18?
No, I mean, yes.
I would rather confirm it now.
I would prefer the 27th.
Yes.
And what is Geraldine wearing?
The pink overall? Cool!
Ah, you lucky one!
No one tells you what to do!
I tried to call for an hour!
You should have get something for me!
That is Penelope. Yes?
No. but like this you look like a
country bumpkin!
Could you set the table please?
Gotta go. Yeah, ok.
See you. Yes, I will call again.
Will you test my German?
Not today, I have something to do.
5 minutes? I need to talk to you.
Me too.
Hello? That's for me.
Please, Vic.
And what when Daddy wants to call?
No, I didnt try it.
What is your pink overall made off?
The security gets reinforcement,
Good night, Papa.
I can't believe it!
I tried to call for an hour!
5 past 5 another treatment to do.
That's a factory not a clinic!
Like Chaplin in "Modern Times":
Tooth out, crack! Tooth out, crack
What's for dinner?
Cold. Pasta and some salami.
Excuse me, but this evening...
I understand, the great art.
How was it?
Tomorrow I'm going over to Guibert again.
Ok, do that.
Is there something, Vic?
What is now with my moped?
We have other things to worry!
Well...
She wants to go on a "Boum".
What kind of "Boum"?
Just a Boum, a party.
And where?
At a guy's place. I don't know him.
Not even his name?
Raoul.
Raoul, Raoul! Raoul how?
I dont know, is that important?
Do you have the adress? Telephone number?
No, everyone is going.
So, I...
At least I have to call the mother...
...of that guy!
It's not a children's birthday party!
Yes exactly! When does it start?
And when does it end?
What do you want to tell her?
"Your son has invited our girl to a party".
Or what? That is stupid!
At your age you can't go without...
You just think about yourselves!
You don't even notice that I...
...lost my necklace and that I shortened my dress!
I have nothing to wear anymore,
Not even socks!
You dont have time to check my English,
You don't even feed me!
It is like you don't care about how I'm doing!
What happened to her?
She's a teenager.
I don't care, I'm going.
Good, just don't forget me!
Penelope, move!
Please! Head movement, ok?
Very good, Samantha!
Ow, my feet are hurting already!
Vic, it's your turn!
She is really annoying today...
Yes!
An alibi? Not from me!
But they listen to you.
Come inside, we will talk about it.
Veronique, Veronique!
E, not F's! Again from number 2.
26 and still a virgin.
How does it have to sound there?
Common!
I have something to eat.
And never surrender.
And never admit.
You have lost a battle.
You know what that means.
What?
But you dont have lost the war.
Second: just lie...
...if you are sure not to be caught.
Third, my child:
What did i wanted to say? Oh yes!
You have to approach it differently.
Different? How?
It is a birthday, not a boum.
And it starts at 7:30 p.m.
What's his name?
Raul.
Well, now his name is Bernard.
Get them to change their mind,
without notice that you try to influence them.
Now i get it.
But wait for the right moment!
In life it depends on the right moment
Do you play Bakarat?
I will show you.
Never, when they are on the phone or
yelling at each other.
At breakfast?
Never at dinner time! Too risky!
Good idea is in the bathroom.
Its calm and intimate
Or even better:
In the "cigarrete break".
The "cigarette break" is the best moment!
Ah, no cigarettes.
Should I get you some?
No thanks. I stopped smoking.
What are you doing?
Should I fill the bathtub?
Yeah, why not?
Listen!
You can wear my green west for the party
or that blue sport-shirt...
...that you like.
Armand and Jean-Pierre on the mopeds!
And Penelope's mother is really coming?
Yes, she will pick us up at 11 p.m.
Common, don't drive so slow!
Ok, here we are.
Don't forget to take off your shoes.
I'll wait a moment until they are inside, ok?
Call us immediately if someone...
Common don't overdo it.
It is a party not a gladiator's fight!
I'm going.
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for you. I don't want to go alone.
Where are your boots?
We walk?
I hid from Armand and Jean-Pierre.
Very cute.
I don't have the courage either.
I'm going back home.
Common!
The song doesn't even have a melody.
Let's go!
That is the good point from it!
Hello! Hi, friends!
Did you came together?
No, it was a coincidence. Let's go inside!
He looked over at me.
Raoul.
Who?
Raoul! He looked at me.
Don't you think he looks like Redford?
What? You are not at the cinema?
Your Dad is too tired. We'll hide in the bedroom.
I'm going for the left-overs.
But when they see you both here...
...everything is lost! Such a party is like a motor.
If he does not start...
...then good night!
My rock-music is better than
that lame disco!
What do you think of her?
The rock is great!
How do you like that chick?
I don't like redheads. I mean Vic!
Ah her? Nice!
Hello, cuties! Hello hello!
Hello! Your big love!
What?
Your great love!
You like Jo, don't you!
Jo? Are you stupid or what?
That dumb chick with her high pitched-mongoloid-voice?
Forget it!
"Hello"...
Hello, Jean-Pierre!
Tell me, is she crazy?
Those two who are kissing over there,
they met at Thierry's home.
I was there with Mathieu.
You know Mathieu?
I'm going with Mathieu to the bedroom, and there they are.
Doing, you know what.
What?
You should know each other before.
Maybe, but not essential.
Hey, wanna dance?
Oh, not alone.
Hello, Caroline! Wanna dance?
Without glasses you look better!
Nothing is going on here.
Wanna go to another funeral?
Look, she's wearing a great shirt.
Wanna go dance?
Why not.
Vic! Raoul says, he would like to go out with you.
Do you like him?
No, but I know someone who does.
Who?
But don't tell anyone!
Penelope
Your kidding me!
Hey, Raoul!
One moment! Turn the music off!
Silence kids! Just a moment!
Common "american quarter", ok?
Ok, guys, all in wait position!
Will you ask Jean-Pierre?
No! I'm gonna ask Roger.
What is an "american quarter"?
The girls ask the boys to dance.
Great!
Who you gonna ask?
Vic says, Penelope would like to go out with you.
What?
She says, Penelope likes you.
What should I tell her?
Sorry.
Raoul is not into you.
I dont care! But Vic said...
Slut!
Is there a telephone?
Over there. Thanks.
Hello, Papa, here is Vic.
You got to pick me up!
When?
She asked me to pick her up now.
And why?
It's lame here.
Nothing is happening there.
Full of little boys, who are almost pissing their pants.
Oh, you're already in bed.
In 30 minutes, ok? Hallo?
We will go to Antoines party...
...but before we will drink something
in Jimmy's Rockhouse.
Seems to me,
as that was yesterday.
I still see you in the front of me
with pigtails and your miniskirt.
Your feel old, don't you?
A bit this evening.
Vic makes us wait!
Maybe she's having fun now.
Next party we will buy a
walkie talkie and play radio-patrol.
In an emergency will be right there.
I'm calling now!
Don't do it, she will flip out.
Always occupied...
If I get trough, I will tell you.
Oh no, we are having fun!
Ok, see you soon
Vic Beretton.
Do not hang up, please.
Hello? Please call again in 15 minutes.
She hung up on me!
That's enough!
I'm going up!
She offers me a "bedjacket".
But she knows that I sleep naked.
It's Daddy's birthday not yours.
Anyway it's gonna be a surprise.
Gilberte always gets the wrong one.
The daughter from the Castafiore...
and Louis de Funes.
Papa is happy with her.
That does not surprise me.
You are so playful today.
Our little sheep is in bad mood today.
Holidays are stupid!
Can you say a sentence without "Crap" and "Shit"!
It's true! That was a great party.
3 days without school, shi... not funny!
What are you giving your grandfather?
Shit! Pardon! I forgot it.
Be right back.
Here you go.
Ãntienne.
Ãntienne!
Don't forget, this evening a colloquium about Anaesthesia.
You know, I'm invited today.
No! We have our colloquium...
...and we will go there!
Yes, of course.
Doctor, the pressure... Pardon!
I'm doing my breathing exercises,
I hope you don't mind.
No problem. Are you a diabetic?
Taking sedatives?
Pregnant? Hm?
His name is Mathieu. He wants to go out with me.
It's a bit early. What do you think?
What will happen?
Going out with somebody, you know what that means?
Of course, cinema, dating...
No, those were your times,
Today it means: to kiss him on the lips!
Oh...
He's already gone?
Please give me Dr. Lagnier.
Hello?
Yes, I will see him this evening.
At your parents place at 7.
Ok, I will tell him.
Mama! You look gorgeous!
Welcome!
Francoise! How are you doing?
Hello, my dear.
Vicki! Hi!
Hello, kid. Hi.
Aren't you very tired?
Remember, dear Gilberte,
nothing can knock me down.
Vic, please give me my handbag.
And were is Francoise?
He will come later by train.
Help your mother or she will fall.
Gilberte, please stop it!
I'm standing with one foot in the grave,
but i don't want someone stepping on the other.
Poupette, I have a surprise!
Hello, Francoise, did you call?
What present? For Dad?
Ah ok, purple package.
Yes, ok.
Were are you? At home?
Yes, of course. I'm waiting for Ãntienne.
Vic forgot it in her room.
Don't worry, cutie, I will find it.
I will call you at 11:42
and you will come to pick me up, ok?
Ok.
Good. I'm hanging up now.
My bath is ready now.
Hello? Are you in the livingroom?
Ok, there is the notebook on the table.
Mom needs the number from Dr. Juroux.
It's a dermatologist in Versailles.
In Versailles? Yes, wait, that...
we will have that soon...
Juroux... Oh my darling,
with your handwriting...
I have it! Dr. Juroux: 951-17-80.
Thanks. So see you this evening.
You don't have any western like Rio Bravo
No, you will get that to breakfast!
Now there is another programm.
Excellent, your truffle salad.
You know what people say about truffles?
They say...
Yes, I know. For such a night
you need stamina like a boxer.
Hey, relax.
You are so nervous.
But a boxing fight goes for 12 rounds.
So what?
You will get trough it.
Come here.
Come here!
What, again?
What is that?
Oh... my train.
What train?
It' about my father-in-law.
About your father-in-law?
Yes, it's his birthday. He's turning 58.
And you choose this evening?
Yes, because my wife...
I lied. And because
I'm not a good liar...
Yes, I told her I had a colloquium about Anaesthesia.
Such a thing does not take a whole night.
Especially not about anaesthesia
And so I thought,
if we take 2 half nights...
Better 2 little lies then a big one.
Weird guy my father-in-law.
Colbert is his name, like the grat Colbert.
He says its an antcestor.
Poupette, his mother...
...the grandmother of Francoise,
she's is more down to earth.
She always says:"I don't have ancestors,
I'm one myself".
Hello? Could I speak with Madame Beretton?
Ah, it's you?
I am the night nurse.
The medical supervisor told me, to tell you...
...that everything went fine.
The fracture was "repaired".
The fracture of the right leg.
What number are you calling...
Are you not Madame Francoise Beretton?
Your husband is fine. He is still in anaesthesia.
He will call you tomorrow.
Goodbye, Madame.
So you see how you can lie.
Man, you are a hussy!
I know.
Hallo, Etienne, here is Francois.
I have to see you right now.
Is it something serious?
Really serious? Are you sick?
Not really. What do you mean?
What?
So you tell mom, that we did not separate.
What is?
Here. That's it.
Tell me, aint that Vic's father?
Yes, so what?
He is sexy!
Those kids nowadays!
Well... at maximum for 3 to 4 weeks.
Yes, a fracture of the left fibula.
The nurse spoke of the right one.
Can we still change it?
Yes, no, it is the left one.
Depends, from where you are looking.
I will show you the X-Rays.
A clean fracture.
How did that happen?
The street was slippery.
No, Etienne is fine, he was lucky.
But you should see his car.
Stop it!
Hi. Did you see him?
No, I was there before 8 p.m...
...and waited untill the bell.
He surely went out through another door.
No, I have his schedule.
From 8 to 9 he has maths and then...
There he is. Go!
I don't want to see him!
Don't act like that!
Hurry, tell him something! Anything!
Yes, if I only knew what to say?
Oh, he told you that?
That can't be true!
Hi!
Hey, Raoul!
Hello.
He didnt see.
Let's go, we have English now.
In that chair you just place the patients,
they sleep without anaesthesia.
Looks like directly from an automobil show.
And costs FF200,000.00!
Nothing can be to expensive for the patients.
I don't want to sit alone in my office.
Raymond, my coffee and the tab!
Hello! Great news!
Sit down, I have to go anyway.
I sold it.
What? Seriously?
Awesome! Her picture story.
Aha!
Already eaten?
4 months, 12 pages a month.
And if the readers like it, an album.
Fantastic!
What can I bring you?
A veal escalope with spaghetti, please.
So, how is he?
Good, I'm happy.
Was about time.
I'm coming!
Must look funny...
...a dentist with a leg in plaster.
I have the X-rays.
It's healing correctly. Parking time over!
You have your car here?
Sure. It really got hit, but he is still driving.
How much your client is paying?
FF600 for a page + materials!
If you would excuse me, I have to go.
My first patient is coming soon.
What is that beeping?
Again 2 o'clock!
I can't be too late.
Sta with her, just 5 minutes.
Will you pay for me?
Again, congratulations on your contract!
See you later.
Do you want another coffee?
No thanks.
It's ok, don't get disturbed.
Be right back.
Could you reserve that spot for me?
It's just an attic without comfort,
but great to work in!
At home, with Vic and the phone calls all the time...!
What is?
Is there a problem?
He broke his leg? When?
Saturday evening, car accident.
But I saw him walking around all healthy on Sunday
Sunday? Are you sure?
100% sure!
Hi! How are you doing, great?
Will you give me a piece?
Are you alone?
Do you have time on Wednesday?
Science-fiction is scary,
but I'm not telling him.
If you just see how good he's looking!
Take a picture in secret.
I would love to have a picture of him.
Is he intelligent?
Yes! After the high school he will go to a
college of hotel management. His father is a chef.
Wait, I will open.
I think that is the perfect job!
People always need to eat.
Madame Valadier, is it here? Yes.
For Madame.
Who is it?
What, flowers?
I almost forgot: March 3rd!
Are those from Jean-Louis?
He has never forgot! And I can't send
him anything because of his wife.
Isn't she jealous?
She knows nothing.
Respect! For 42 years.
Yes, "Back Street" is a true story.
What is that?
The story of a lunatic...
...who gets married to an idiot who loves a slut.
Also: To be or not to be,
that is the... the...
That's the question.
That is the question!
Not bad, but you could do better, Vic!
Ok, lesson is over.
So you will try your best?
Well...
That was the first time you said something in English class.
Yes, yes! Now go.
Hello kids
Do we have time to drink something?
Yes!
And how do you like those?
It sparkles like a christmas tree!
Oh a great pipe! Cool!
Hi!
Hey, cuties!
Hey, but we don't go to watch Disney movie...
Why? What do you want?
I've seen "In the Realm of the Senses".
Three students, please.
How old are you? 13 years and 2 days.
Thanks, Madame.
Thank you, Madame.
Wanna sit together? Of course!
Geraldine, move a bit.
So what is?
Please be quiet, now its art time!
You pig!
What is?
What happened?
Jut look how they are driving
And thanks a lot!
Oh, shit!
I had prohibited you...
...to be a passenger on a moped!
Mom, that is Mathieu.
And without a helmet!
Do you need to drive like a lunatic?
You better go, Mathieu.
So goodbye, Madame.
Now I am the evil old one.
The Taxi could have killed you!
You are lazy in school, don't listen.
I don't have faith anymore in you.
You spoiled everything.
And I got a cake!
Good. That's all.
See you tomorrow.
Madame Berreton?
Yes, that's me.
Excuse me for coming so late.
Not a problem.
Want to go in the court over there?
Please don't tell me anything now,
she is intelligent and does not work.
I don't want to.
But your daughter thinks of me as an idiot.
You are overdoing it.
But why?
One day she forgets her grammar,
another day her notebook, another day...
...she has migraine.
Then she had to care of you, because you were sick.
About me?
Yes.
But she is... lovely and agreable,
and alive like a bird.
But concerning work...
So she is lively in school?
Done, Poupette, I went out with him!
Four times to cinema, once on his moped
and two times just so.
And today he will pick me up at 5 o'clock
at the "Comedie Francaise".
You will recognize him.
He is the best looking one.
April 15th, between 7 and 8.
The zipper is jammed again!
You are breaking it!
The masseur asks, if between 7 and 8 is ok?
What masseur?
For your medical therapy.
Ok. Everyday, beginnign April 15th.
This morning it was still working.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Dad.
Don't break a leg.
That is not the worst.
Why do you say that?
If I break a leg...
...I will be home sooner
Very funny! Here, your calcium.
You wanted to go!
For 3 months you were talking about Easter holidays.
But I like it here.
We liked if it would not happen.
4,000.00 FF plus the skies!
Is it because of Mathieu?
Who is Mathieu?
No it's not.
Lets go.
I'm going alone, it looks stupid...
...if I bring you.
Hurry.
Goodbye.
Is it for me?
Today's Menu:
Scrambled eggs with truffel,
ham from parma and salad.
Today we are alone,
Lets celebrate this. Ok?
What is your problem?
I don't like scrambled eggs with truffel.
And you.
You're cute.
Oh! Damn!
Oh!
Thanks, I can do it alone.
I'm going.
Francoise, it's your husband.
What are you saying? In Jimmy's Rockhouse?
You joking. Yes, cuz Sophie,
Yes, there is Sophie, a girl and she is a regular guest.
Did you go without permisssion?
Yeah, I got a good trick.
I have to pass mom's bedroom door,
if I want to go outside.
I say that I must go to the bathroom,
it's right beside the entry door.
While she is asleep I just go to the toilet.
Do you understand?
I put clothes up on the flushing tank.
And I can leave without her noticing anything.
How do you get back?
With the same trick.
I must pay a lot,
because my sister is blackmailing me.
How is it going?
Not a single guy.
Not even a Ski Teacher!
Just women.
I'm coming. No, I meant Sophie.
Mathieu? He is not calling.
I think that all is just a single big proof of his love
His plastered leg, Etienne's crushed car
and the humor that's in there.
At least he makes you laugh!
Ah, just look at everyone!
Rich, soft and rough.
But one you can laugh about...
...you must search long.
Now she is selling the perfume "Plaster d'amour".
Anyway we have to do something.
Should I smash your face?
Romance, with a touch of exotism...
...fresh and good.
Oh, no problem.
If you allow?
Go ahead.
Hm... very sensual!
Oh God, what's up with me?
You are a clumsy one, Madame.
I'm so sorry!
Do you have "Imprinte" from Courage?
This is some fine powder,
transparent and causes no allergies.
Smells kinda cheap.
Don't you think?
Oh, please excuse.
Smells kinda tarty, hm?
Please wait!
I'm a bit confused today.
What do you think you are doing?
Stop! Stop I say!
Are you demented? Stop it!
Are you completely insane?
I'm calling the police!
Hello? Is this the police?
Ah, before I forget...
That's yours, no?
She is insane! Hysteric!
Hello, Madame. Did you see that?
That broad is crazy!
Would you be so kind, Madame, to be a witness?
You saw, how she destroyed my boutique!
Here they come.
Goodbye!
Hello, Papa!
Hello. You look great.
This is Sophie, my parents.
Did someone called?
Yes, Mathieu, yesterday.
Yesterday! And what did he say?
Oh, mom! Mathieu called!
Will we see us tomorrow?
we are calling.
Your plaster is gone!
This is done.
Ah, Vic... we decided...
Excuse, you decided.
No, we, me and you!
We both think that, in the next time...
...we need some change of air.
Are you also going to the mountains?
No. your father and I, we want a bit...
Can I make a party for my birthday?
Listen!
Your father will live somewhere else for some time.
Where?
At a friends house.
Entienne?
No way!
In Alps!
I read that german sheperd killed himself there...
...because he couldn't understand German.
Francois, I'm trying to tell it to Vic!
At Antoine place. Not for long.
Ein Monat?
Two!
One or two...
We will see us at weekends.
Why?
Because I...
Because sometimes,
if you love someone for a long time...
...it's sometimes good to get...
It becomes a habit...
You want to live separate?
Yes, kinda.
Only on weekends...
What is with weekends?
There are always partys on Saturdays.
Are you going to get divorced?
I was so excited to see him again.
I just felt butterflies in my stomach.
It was just like in a movie,
a slow floating, like in slowmotion.
Slowmotion if often forced.
Hello, here is Francois Beretton.
Antoine is not at home.
I'm from 1 to 2 at Betty,
between 5 and 7 at Francine.
About tomorrow if Angele is calling:
Angele, my dear,
I would like to come to a candlelight dinner.
Claudine, my dear, I'm sorry,
I don't have anymore time.
If it's Francoise, is it you?
When can I come home again?
Hello?
Hello? Ah, it is you Poupette.
Penelope saw them together yesterday.
At Jimmy's Rockhouse.
She is 16 and her name is Lydia.
She has a crush on him.
She is not stopping.
You know she is one of those...
...she goes, if it is necessary...
Very interesting.
Is she really one of those?
Oh, la la !
Bronze-Teint, mascara!
The daughter of Alain Delon and Mona Lisa.
We have to stop it.
What do you think? Strangers can often help.
Outrageous!
Does your mother knows it?
Why should I tell her?
Make him jealous.
Those tricks are too old
How do you do it nowadays?
Madame Beretton!
Are you there?
What did you say?
She just arrived! With Raoul!
What? Yes, Lydia too.
Let's skate today.
I met a incredible guy!
Dustin Hoffman but blond!
Yes?
Is Vic with you?
No, why?
I just arrived home and she's not here.
Where is she?
That is unimportant.
I'm really concerned!
Hello!
Mom is not here. Penelope neither.
Who is there?
Francois Beretton, Vic's father.
Ah, ok!
Where is she?
She is out with Penelope.
But where?
Ok, she is in Jimmy's Rockhouse.
I have chickenpox...
...or I would be there too.
If mom asks, Penelope was at your place!
Ok, Thank you.
No problem. Goodbye
Goodbye.
I wanna dance.
I lend you my boyfriend. How do you like him?
Looks like Donald Duck.
Ok!
Are you dancing with your girlfirend?
Ok.
A pair of skates.
Your Dad is here!
That is Vic father!
What does he wants here? Vic's dad?
Wanna dance? Are you coming?
Dad please, listen to me!
Stop! You are going home now!
One second!
One second, please!
I'll explain it to you.
Are you insane?
Are you totaly crazy?
Who is dancing with Vic?
Don't know.
Vic needs a father.
A man, who is making the rules, you understand?
It's important in her age.
Really smooth, yes?
Respect and discipline are very important!
But, a family is needed.
Yes!
What is that?
My Angora-Pullover.
This way it won't harden.
Well after what happened today...
what hapened today...
I should...
Hopefully it is smooth enough.
Hopefully.
And it's raining! And my wipers are broken"
Done! Good night.
Good Night.
Shit.
Francois...
Francois, wake up!
What... what time is it?
It's past 6.
I don't want Vic to see you here.
You mean... she will be shocked?
If she sees you in the bed,
"You came back"...
...and didn't I came back?
One month no parties, fourteen days no cinema
and pentecost with your grandparents.
About my birthday... I dont want to talk.
Just don't get busted.
Like 1918, when i went with Fujita...
into weekend...
Old Japanese painter, a semi-god!
I told at home, "I'm doing a pilgrimage...
...to Lourdes".
For pentecoste I know something.
I will play in Brussel in front of Queen Fabiola.
Wanna come with me?
Yes, but they won't let me.
Leave it to me.
And what do I do with Mathieu?
Don't mind him!
You don't have someting better?
That is your only chance.
Hello, Dad.
Oh, thank you.
Kids, today we will go eat fancy!
But Mom is not here.
Oh. Then we go alone.
As lovers.
What? Right now?
Yes, go change!
Yes!
And here it was.
Here she told me that, you are on the way.
We sat over there.
Were you surprised?
And how did she told you that?
With a drawing. You know her.
One morning I'm going to the clinic,
I was just before the exam,
there was a caricature of me
With a huge belly.
Very funny.
And in the evening we went to eat here.
I still remember what she ordered.
A double portion spaghetti and strawberries.
Dld you also eat from it?
Oh yeah I munched like hell.
I'm not having kids.
Hm, when the right one comes...
If one day one will come,
who will love me, you know,
He will suffer, I'm telling you.
Is it that bad?
Because of... Mathieu?
It is like a pain in the stomach.
It hurts.
Yeah. Same for me.
Dumb.
It is really stupid.
Too stupid.
It's not easy.
It is really not easy.
791
01:14: 83 --> 01:14:24,050
No, please no.
Hey, go away! Move on, kid!
Hurry, go on!
Common hurry!
Thank you...
You are bleeding.
Yes.
Without you, I would be...
Not often, someone...
Can I... invite you for a drink?
No thanks.
I insist!
How can I show my gratefullness?
You know what would make me happy?
No, what? Tell me.
If you could leave my wife alone.
Already back?
Our dance teacher is sick.
Tell me about the Spanish succesion-war,
What?
The Spanish suc...
Let me think. Louis XIV...
the Austrians... Germans...
In one hour someone will come to get the drawings.
Let's do it later
If it's about my problems you have never time
At school you are lively and friendly, and here?
Who said that?
Here, never a smile, you never tell me anything.
I can't give you a kiss.
You just get lively if it's about party.
Ah, I'm already acting like an old school mother
And the things with your father. I will explain it.
We can talk about everything.
I didn't tell you because I thought it was better not to,
I feel that you are slowly going out of my control...
Am I in a cage?
Yes. But the door is open.
If you don't need me, you can go away.
But now it's to early,
Don't you think?
And when Dad is coming back?
Hello? Ah, Hello.
Very good, thanks.
Listen, your ex-husband...
He is not my ex-husband.
We are just separated for now.
He is not up to date.
I met him yesterday...
We were in a fight with hooligans.
Is he injured?
Who is it?
What do you say?
How many were they?
He gave me a black eye.
What? He struck you down...
...or did he save you?
Both.
Ok. We talk later again.
Ok, see you.
Who was that?
A friend. A college from the work.
Do I know him?
No.
That is Penelope's friend dad.
Isn't he sexy?
I have to go. See you.
See you.
Hello.
Hello.
I spoke with you some time ago.
I'm Penelope's sister.
Oh yes...
Yes.
Are you waiting for Vic?
Today at 5 p.m. No girls!
Ok.
Jean-Pierre is coming too.
At 5 p.m., ok?
Wait a sec.
The chickenpox are gone.
First your hitting teenagers,
Now that!
Are you crazy?
Could you repeat that?
In the dark you look like a playboy,
But in the daylight, you are just an old maniac.
Give me that helmet!
Will you...
Take your fingers off!
Will you...
Take your fingers off!
Stop it! Be resonable!
I said stop!
What are you caring about?
Aren't you ashamed?
Mathieu, stop it!
I'm telling you to stop, Mathieu!
Stop it!
What is that for? What happened?
Are you looking for this?
Dad, what is going on? Here.
Nothing.
Thanks, Vic.
What. You know each oher?
He's my German teacher.
Come!
Hey!
Was that Vic's father?
And you knew it? Yeah...
He wanted to beat you?
Great! That's great!
Yeah, great...
If you knew what that whistle means to me.
That's him!
And his lips were on it.
Did you see the heart he attached to it?
Nice idea.
When I saw the bundle,
I wanted to cry.
I did!
No, he went to Cabourg.
Well, we can't go there.
But Amsterdam... Rembrandt's "Night Watch",
Bruges with it's buildings!
And then Brussels, the concert...
Julia was just 15 and Romeo...
Sure, but look how that ended...
What about Vermeer?
We love like the adults.
Why can't we do it like then?
I don't want to wait till I'm 18.
Where would you be if you were 18?
In Cabourg.
We would have a date on the beach,
I would jump in his arms,
We would forget everything
and then sleep together.
Naked?
Why not? There is "the Pill"!
Ah, I forgot that.
But the pill helps to not get pregnant but do not protect...
...against the pain of the heart.
I hate it when you speak like..
...I'm just a 3 years old child.
I never did.
Where are you going?
To Cabourg!
Hello? Could I talk to Mathieu?
Yes.
He's there! What should I tell him?
You are in Deauville visiting a friend!
Hello, Mathieu. It's Vic.
Where are you?
In Cabourg.
Ah! And with who?
Nobody. I ran away.
Are you stupid?
What? How did you get here?
Hitchhiking.
Could we see each other?
I think so.
Where are you going to sleep?
What should I say now?
I don't know. Whatever you want.
I have a cold.
In one hour in front of the casino, ok?
What were you thinking?
And your friend in Deauville?
Yes, your grandmother is not so good,
but your "friend" was ideal!
Let him decide.
Do not spoil his holidays!
Your arriving like: Hello here I am,
now be happy!
But a women that gives herself has to be a present
and not a source of problems.
If he loves me, he will forgive me.
No, that's just silly!
"Give yourself to him" without "throwing yourself away".
That's how you stay independent.
You are scared that I might sleep with him.
Be careful!
There are kids, who already have kids
at the age of 14.
So, what should I do?
You will not walk out on me?
You did not answer me!
Did you left her here?
It wasnt like that!
Lydia, she was just...
How long have you been with her?
Shouldn't you call home?
Now I can guess.
Would you dance?
No, she's not dancing! Come!
Where?
Mademoiselle, I would like to pay.
We have some peace and quiet here.
What are you saying?
Shhh!
There are always some people hanging around.
Come in.
What's that?
That was just my brother's duck.
What are you doing?
I'm inflating the air mattress.
If you are cold, there are some clothes.
Here, take that.
Thanks, I'm not cold.
You did not say anything...
...about what happened at home.
Yeah, I think you are...
But Mathieu, I didn't ran away because of them, but for you.
5,000.00 FF
Good. Pull your card, Sir.
You are risking a lot, Madame.
Much more than you think.
What is?
I can't breathe trough the nose.
Ow! You hit me.
That was the rake.
Where you together the entire night?
You and Lydia.
No.
I'm glad that you are here.
In your arms like that,
you know, that...
It was worth to take a detour.
I mean to travel here.
What's that?
The mattress.
I fill it up again.
It's 3:00 a.m. already!
You wanna leave?
I have to work early.
I begin at 6:00 a.m., my mother...
Is your mother so important now?
You should call yours.
Great! I arrive here hitchhiking,
I find a guy with an air mattress on the beach
and both are empty!
And what did you expected?
The cops will look for you.
I hoped you will protect me!
I didn't ask you to come!
Then go!
I can get trough this on my own.
You just hitchhiked from Paris to Cabourg
and you think you are the best!
Go! Your mother is surely worried!
Shit!
Vic, it's me. Please open
Not sleeping?
Your mom is.
And you are not asking me?
No, but I will listen.
I can reassure you that nothing happened.
And what did you do?
I lost at Bakara.
But I won at Poker.
Come in!
Where can I put this, Madame?
Here, on the table.
Madame.
Oh, I'm starving!
Friday you are coming with us.
We leave at 3:00 p.m. because of the traffic! Ok?
Could three of us go out eat something?
Pardon.
Good evening.
Oh, thanks.
What is that?
You are surely hungry?
Ah, are they cute!
Teacher is not here?
Eric? Why?
I thought we eat 3 persons.
You surely sent him same cartoon as well.
He is...
Stop it! You just say awful things.
Two dads for one child. That happens often.
Think about Jesus.
I thougt about you.
Please, don't say anything now.
I'm pregnant.
What, already?
Two months now.
Agadir, the beach, the sun and two of us, so nice, but...
...I just wanted to have vacation.
Nothing else.
So there are multiple families.
You can differ them with simple tests
Did you get him?
No it was his mother on the phone, again.
I said I was you.
He's still sick.
He had a bad cold in Cabourg.
I'm not feeling well, either.
Let me see.
Ah, nothing.
A party without Mathieu is like a wedding without the groom.
But the others are coming!
I only want Mathieu!
Do you have a lot left? I have to go.
No, no, now I...
Just the neon lights and a compressor.
Ah, there you are!
But... what is all that?
A dental clinic.
And my party tomorrow?
With all that stuff around?
I have to go to the publisher,
I will be back in an hour, we will find something.
I promise!
And lock up, when they are finished!
Hello? Ah, Penelope. A disaster?
Here too. You have the chickenpox?
The first thing I got for free from my sister!
Sorry, Francoise, I just wanted
to tell you that today...
That is leased stuff.
We have to talk!
I have nothing to tell you!
Please listen!
So yesterday...
Doesn't matters, today is different.
Sure, I know that...
What? What is different today?
One moment.
What is different?
I did not have a lover yesterday, today I have one.
That is different!
You have nothing else to tell me?
Yes, your daughter...
...wants to have a party!
And she's thinking about that party for weeks!
But your stuff... you spoiled it!
Gratulation! Here is the ultrasound picture.
It will be a boy!
Please sign.
So much stuff for a room.
Great God!
Ain't that a bit too much?
Look at his chin, just like yours!
Not convincing. Sorry.
You should be happy.
You have a beautiful wife.
She has talent, you are having a child,
she is making the best scrambled eggs in Paris...
...and she loves you.
And she has a lover!
No! God, that is so exciting!
You are standing on her side.
She's is the best for you!
I will sent her flowers and a card.
I'm telling you for years that you are an idiot,
but you didn't believe me.
Stop teaching me!
Could you ever keep a man with you?
Sorry.
You don't get yelled at my age.
It makes me younger.
Can I still tell you something?
That child is your only chance, to get your wife back.
Use that chance!
It's almost to late.
Almost.
Who's baby? Who is getting a baby?
We
How is your sister?
Awesome! Red dots everywhere.
Even on the nose. And at the eyes,
on her forehead, like freckles!
Where are the chairs going?
Up there! Tell everyone, ok?
We don't have enough ham!
No, that is enough.
Main thing, we have enough cola.
Did Geraldine bring the cake?
She still has to come! You have to go?
I still have some time.
But they will come soon.
He will surely come too.
Have fun!
Bye!
You will write me?
Off course! As soon as I arrive.
You know now that I am 14,
I maybe could have a moped...
Why not?
After what?
After the baby.
I don't want you to get excited about it.
I called a moment ago to reserve two tickets to Venice.
Monsieur and Madame Beretton?
Yes!
Hello.
Hello.
How are you?
Thanks.
Ah, you will be travelling?
Yes.
Aha.
Where?
Africa.
Alone?
No, with Eric. And you?
What do you mean?
Are you going on a trip too?
Yes. I just wanted to get my rubber boots.
Will you help me?
I'm late.
Can you get me a taxi?
I have to be at 8:00 a.m. at Roissy Airport
Listen,... I...
My plane... flies at 10:00 a.m.
If you want I'll drive you there.
Where are you flying?
Venice.
Should I open?
Hi!
What is that?
I have to wear it for 6 months.
Thanks. Hi.
Poupette!
Happy Birthday!
Oh, Thank you. Those are cute!
I made a publicity today!
Harp melodies by Debussy over a cup of Ravioli!
I will park the car.
No need, thanks.
Well then, have fun!
Gonna cut school tomorrow,
it's the last day.
I'm going. It's the only enjoyable day at school.
Want to dance?
He's not coming.
What are you talking about?
Should I open?
Yes.
Is that an idea?
I'm eating with Jean-Louis.
His wife is in Evian for health treatment.
You are beautiful.
He did not came, hm? Oh, no!
Dont forgett. You are a winner!
The daughter of Napoleon
and the beautiful Otero.
I hope you understand.
Monsieur, can I see your ticket?
Thank you.
Hugo, Antoine and Cecile. Hello.
Happy Birthday.
Wanna dance?
Yes.
Good evening, Madame.
Please.
Hi, Marc. How are you?
Hello. Ok.
Want to drink something?
No, maybe later, thanks.
Can I ask you not to smoke please?
Please stop!
Hey, Mathieu, you are here!
Great! Lets have a drink!
