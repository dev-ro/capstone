You came here to kill me.
You came here to kill me.
The suspect Niedermann should
be regarded as extremely dangerous.
Exercise extreme caution.
All patrols, sign in.
81-20, can you hear me?
81-20, you hear me?
Eight, one, two, zero.
Can you hear me?
Her name is
Lisbeth Salander.
She is 27 years old.
In this issue of Millennium
we reveal --
- How Swedish government officials
have conspired against her --
- To protect a pathologically
deranged killer.
Alexander Zalachenko is a renegade
GRU agent from the Soviet Union.
In Sweden, he has committed
serious crimes:
Trading in Arms, drug dealing,
and sex trafficking
Alexander Zalachenko is
Lisbeth Salander father.
This issue of Millennium is
dedicated to clearing her name.
Hi.
Can you open your eyes?
My name is Anders Jonasson.
I am a doctor here.
You are in Sahlgrenska
Hospital in Gothenburg.
Can you count to ten?
One, two, three, four...
That is good.
My text is on pages 40-50.
I will have excerpts of
Björck's report by facsimile...
...To make it stronger,
more stylish
- What have we of photographic material?
- Not much.
We can get pictures of Gunnar Björck,
Teleborian and Zalachenko we hope.
- Some from St. Stephen's Hospital?
- Yes, and of Lisbeth.
- It sounds like at least 75 pages.
- Yes, amd tt may be more. It'll be good.
- Can we get more names?
- No, we must focus on what we have.
We can hope that the publication
will force others to light.
There would be names
and material for future issues.
Now we work.
We bring further news after the police
murder near Gosseberga this morning.
A massive police turnout is
hunting for the perpetrator.
Police have identified him --
- As the 35-year German
Ronald Niedermann.
He is armed, and the police
describe him as very dangerous.
- I am looking Fredrik Clinton.
- Who can I say it is?
Evert Gullberg,
I am an old colleague.
Dad is resting, but come inside.
Zalachenko does what is best for
him, no matter the consequences.
That is my assessment too.
We cannot risk
that he begins to talk.
We need to silence him
at any cost.
I agree.
It wont be "we" though.
You can see,
how I am now.
Fredrik, we need you.
One last time.
I cannot.
I spend five hours --
- Every other day at the hospital
on the dialysis machine,
I will die soon.
I cannot get a new kidney.
That's it, my friend.
- Thank you.
- They are freshly baked.
I did not know you had a daughter.
No.
We do not know much
about each other's private lives.
Despite the fact that we have
worked together for...
... yes, more than 35 years.
Lisbeth Salander?
The case is already underway.
What do we do with her?
Hey Lisbeth.
How are you?
Do you remember me?
Anders Jonasson is my name.
It is understandable if you're tired.
You came in with a bullet in your head.
We managed to remove the ball.
It has not damaged any vital parts,
As far as we can see.
You also had gunshot wounds in
the right shoulder and left hip.
But it seems that they will heal fine.
Can it give me brain damage?
Brain injuries are complex,
but you should not worry.
The police wanted to talk to you.
But I refused them access to you,
because of your condition.
They will try again surely,
but I will not let them come yet.
How is Zalachenko?
He is patched together
and his condition is stable.
But it's pretty bad.
Damn.
I was wondering when
you would show up.
We have discussed how
we can help you.
But to develop a strategy,
we must first hear your version.
And how should the strategy look?
We must prepare together.
But I think it'll be difficult to
avoid a short stay in prison.
Uh-huh! Really, you think so!
We will help with a lawyer
and everything else needed
But you must cooperate
and give us some guarantees.
Niedermann.
Niedermann is the culprit!
It was he
who shot Lisbeth.
There are strong suspicions against you,
which will be hard to circumvent.
It is your problem.
It is your problem.
If you do not solve it --
- I will contact the media.
I have names, dates,
events - everything.
I can crush you completely.
I am a survivor.
You ought to know by now.
- Zalachenko you do not understand...
- It is you who does not understand!
This conversation is over.
Just one more thing.
Lisbeth...
- What is wrong with her?
- She must be put away, understood?
Good. Good.
Hello. Excuse me for being late.
Here is my sister.
We will speak later, bye.
- Is there no one at home?
- No.
But Micke, she tried to kill
her father with an axe.
That's attempted murder.
Or self-defense.
So is she not arrested for the attempted
murder of Zalachenko then, or what?
Whats she needs is a
criminal law attorney.
Lisbeth and her mother were subjected
to violence and abuse --
- By Zalachenko and the authorities.
It started long before Gosseberga.
Here, I have documents confirming it.
A copy of the investigation conducted
by one of Sapo: Gunnar Björck.
It proves that they illegally locked up
a twelve-year girl  at St. Stephen's --
- despite her young age.
Is this classified?
Say you've obtained it from a journalist
who will not say where he got it.
You are willing to do anything
for Lisbeth Salander aren't you?
Yes.
I do not need a lawyer.
You will be charged with the attempted
murder of your father.
Micke thinks they will try to get you
in the mental hospital again --
- So yes, you need a lawyer.
But you can choose another.
Unless you want the court to
appoint a public defender.
Does your silence mean
that I should leave?
It's your choice
Do you have a cigarette?
- Do you have a nicotine patch?
- Yes, one moment.
Hi, I'm in Room Three,
Will the stretcher come soon?
I got this from Micke.
I think you know what it contains?
The two of us need to talk
a lot with each other.
So I want you to be completely
honest with me.
Micke has told me most of it
but some things he says he will.. --
- You must decide
if you want to tell.
I assume you know
what he thinks.
There is something about computers
and a DVD disc.
After everything we've done for you
through the years --
- Then you threaten us.
It is quite rude.
I am a survivor.
I do what I must to survive.
No, you do it because you are an evil
and throughly rotten man without honor.
Without morals.
I came here to give you our response.
We will not help you this time, you bastard.
You have no choice.
Do you not understand that?
Life has taught me
that there always exists a choice.
Idiots.
Idiots.
- I will crush you.
- You will not do anything.
No, lay down!
Sorry! I'll go and see what happened.
Out! Everyone must get out!
He has a gun!
What happened?
Hurry!
Wait, I'm coming.
Hold on. Come here.
There. Hold on to me.
He pulled the door handle, but couldn't
open it. It was so unreal.
An old man with the pistol.
Then I heard the shot
when he shot himself.
Are you sure that he tried
to get to Lisbeth?
Yes, it was awful!
I've never been so scared before.
- Shall I come down to you?
- No.
You do not need to come. I'll sleep
with Vera Åkerlund in Kålltorp.
- Press conference at the police station.
- I'll have to run.
- Take care of yourself.
- Yes.
- We'll talk.
- Yes. Bye.
Why did the police not
keep a better watch?
It's absolutely unbelievable.
You don't think such things can happen here.
That someone who is armed can walk into a
ward and kill a patient is unbelievable.
Well... Fredrik?
What in the world...?
Come in, come.
We are trying to get information
about it now.
What time was it?
Find out.
What the hell?
- You have heard what happened?
- Zalachenko has been shot.
It is Evert Gullberg
who shot him.
There is chaos there.
We have not had anything confirmed.
I am confirming it.
It was Evert who shot him.
To complete the plans.
- Should I get coffee or something?
- No, not now.
What the hell are you talking about?
What plans?
Gullberg had only a few months
left to live. He had liver cancer.
He chose to make a final,
last effort for us.
He went down with his honor intact.
- You knew he would kill him?
- Of course.
His mission was to close
the mouth of Zalachenko.
And Salander too, was the plan.
Are you equally as
insane as Gullberg?
Think about what you say, Hallberg.
It was the correct decision.
- We did what was necessary.
- Necessary? Decision?
You and Gullberg have no mandate
to decide anything!
Whatever happens, Zalachenko's
death can not be linked to us.
Nor Evert Gullberg either.
Our task is to
make the decisions --
- That no one else dares to.
Least of all politicians.
It's that simple.
One more thing...
I have come back into service.
I shall lead the operational side --
- Until this crisis is over.
The man who fired the deadly
shot and later took his own life --
- has been identified
as a 78-year-old pensioner.
He has worked as an
accountant and tax lawyer.
- What was his name?
- We will not disclose that at this time.
Is there a connection
to Lisbeth Salander?
We can certainly reject any possible
connection to Lisbeth Salander.
This was a lonely perpetrator
who acted as he did --
- based on his own
paranoid imagination and ideas.
He has sent confused messages
to famous politicians and the media --
-  In which there are death threats
to Alexander Zalachenko.
SÄPO are investigating the matter,
but this man was obviously mentally ill.
That is everything from the
police press conference.
We now return to the incidents at
Sahlgrenska Hospital in Gothenburg.
No!
- Lunch time?
- Yes. Hamburger today.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Lisbeth?
Lisbeth?
- Need help?
- No thanks.
Eat your food properly.
I have a suggestion.
I do not need a ride home.
I have rented a room.
Will you stay overnight?
I am completely finished.
I slept poorly, damn editor.
So we just sleep.
It is the fourth time
that car is out there.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- How could we resolve this?
- We could not foresee everything.
- Monitoring at the hospital has increased.
- Yes, and thank fuck for that!
How in the hell do you
avoid a trial now?
I do not think we can.
A secure ward and a psychiatric
assessment should contain her.
She must be punished for the
attempted murder of Zalachenko.
And to be treated in a secure
psychiatric facility.
- And why not here at St. Stephen's?
- Yes.
If nothing else, for her sake.
Who is the prosecutor?
Ekström.
Not a star, but ambitious.
We can handle him.
- And the other copies of Björck report?
- We are collecting them now.
You ought to at least be able
to do that anyway.
You worry too much.
And what of the blonde muscle
who worked for Zalachenko?
- What happened to him?
- Ronald Niedermann.
He is on the run.
It is probably just a matter of time.
He is Lisbeth Salander's half brother.
Zalachenko had an affair
with a woman in Hamburg.
It reminds me of Hell
in a Greek tragedy.
Zalachenko trying to shoot his daughter
while her brother helps.
Then she returns from the dead --
- To smash an axe into
the head of her father.
Yes, you can choose to look
at it that way.
You'll hear from me.
We'll talk. Goodbye.
Hey you!
Give back my bag!
Give me my bag!
What the fuck...!
A guy on a moped stole my bag.
What? How are you?
Are you okay?
I'm fine. But Björck's
report was in that bag.
It's okay. I made a copy.
Annika, I'll call you back.
Milton Security, this is Armansky.
This is Mikael Blomkvist.
I need your help.
- What is the problem?
- I've had a break-in.
We can help.
Can I call you from the office?
- Of course, call me on my cell phone.
- Fine. Bye.
- The charges against Lisbeth Salander
are not complicated.
Even if the plaintiff himself,
Alexander Zalachenko, is dead.
But if everything about Zalachenko comes out,
the trial becomes much more complicated.
It applies to human life and Swedish
relations with foreign nations --
- And the Security Police's
top-secret contacts.
I read the reports - well, mostly
as background material.
It has no significance to the indictment
against Lisbeth Salander.
And the Attorney has confiscated it.
But parts of the report are useful.
Especially as Lisbeth Salander
has tried to kill her father before.
I'll see if you can get
access to that part.
Yes, it could perhaps be beneficial.
Then I will make sure
you get it.
Who is your boss?
My orders come
from the very top.
This means that you can not
talk to anyone but me about this.
I'll be very discreet.
- Anders Jonasson?
- Yes.
My name is
Peter Teleborian.
I am the senior consultant at St.
Stephen's psychiatric clinic in Uppsala.
I need to talk to you.
It is about one of your patients.
Lisbeth Salander.
- Yes?
- Well... Okay.
I have had the care of her
since she was twelve years old --
- And I have a very good insight into
her pyschological disorders.
- How does it look?
- Lisbeth is seriously mentally disturbed.
She has obvious delusions
with paranoid schizophrenic features.
Like all sociopaths,
she is completely without empathy.
Quite simple.
I see her as withdrawn,
but not as paranoid sociopath.
She is extremely manipulative.
This is all included in my previous evaluations.
She shows what she thinks you want to see.
Of course, I am deeply
concerned for her mental condition.
I understand that.
I'll have to see her to assess
her condition before the trial.
I can unfortunately not help you.
I have responsibilty for Lisbeth --
-- and she is too weak to meet anyone
other than her lawyer.
I have the court's authorization
to have a meeting with her.
I had hoped to avoid being formal,
between colleagues, but I have to.
As her doctor you should know that
it is my assessment that applies here --
-- Regardless of what the court says.
So I must ask you to wait patiently
for my decision to change.
I had hoped for a more
professional response.
Can we rule out that the government
has been aware of this?
They must have known that a Russian
spy defected to Sweden.
We had a socialist government in '76
when Zalachenko came here.
In 30 years nothing was leaked.
It would have not been kept secret,
if a lot of politicians knew about it.
All write memoirs and biographies now.
The same applies to SÄPO.
It would be leaked sooner or later.
It may be a small secret group,
acting entirely on their own.
With significant resources
and influence.
If there are no leaks from this group in 30
years, how and where should we dig?
The best lead we have
is Evert Gullberg.
We find something on him
and perhaps it will lead further.
It must not take too much time though,
otherwise the issue of Millennium will be in trouble.
The magazine must go on sale simultaneously
the day the trial starts.
Can you look at this?
- How am I doing?
- You are clearly improving.
I will ensure that you get help
to get started with physio.
- I do not need help.
- I think you do. Don't pick the scab.
And you should eat a little more.
You should do something about the food.
- The food?
- Can you fix a pizza or something?
I doubt that pizza is on the
county physician's menu.
A Dr. Peter Teleborian
would like to see you.
He said that he had contact
with you in the past.
He had to go away with
his mission unfulfilled.
Good.
This is for you.
Hello. We met at the hospital the night
that Lisbeth Salander arrived.
- I can remember.
- I want to talk to you about something.
I will not disclose information
about Lisbeth Salander.
No, I will give you information
about Lisbeth. Important information.
Such a conspiracy! Sorry,
but it sounds very unlikely.
I can well understand what you think
but I assure you - everything is true.
Everything can be documented and
I will shortly publish the whole story.
I'm also helping to build Lisbeth's defense
for her trial. That is why I am here.
- I want ask you one thing.
- What?
Lisbeth has secrets.
Private secrets, that she will
need in her defense.
To gain access to the evidence
against her she needs this.
- The Prosecutor has forbidden her communicating.
- So I ask you.
- Hey, how does you feel?
- Okay.
- Can I examine you?
- Yes.
Let's see...
- Does it hurt?
- No.
- What about your headaches?
- Okay.
- They disappear more and more.
- Good.
The policeman from Stockholm
called again.
He introduced himself as
the Investigation Leader.
He wants to come and question you.
Can you bend your head slightly backwards?
Not too much.... He was quite annoyed
than we are so stubborn.
I can not keep them at bay with the excuse
of your medical condition much longer.
You get well *too* quickly.
Do you understand?
I said that you need
a couple more weeks.
You will then be transferred to
jail in Stockholm.
I saw the tattoo on your back.
It is quite large.
- Why did you get it done?
- Why do you ask?
- Pure curiosity.
- Private reasons I will not mention.
Okay. Sorry.
It must have hurt
and have taken time.
Yes, it both hurt
and took time.
Sorry.
Hey Lisbeth. With this you can tell
your version of the story.
Your autobiography.
Annika does not know that you have
access to this, and so it must remain.
Should I give her the DVD?
We also need to know more
about Teleborian.
I live in your apartment.
Mine is monitored and may be tapped.
Murder Suspect Lisbeth Salander will be
transferred from the Sahlgrenska in Gothenburg --
- To the Kronoberg Prison in Stockholm
As soon as her condition allows.
The Police press spokesman
has informed us.
The trial is scheduled to begin
at the start of November this year.
Plague, are you there?
It's okay to give the DVD to Annika,
but I will write about the rape.
I have contacted Plague
regarding Teleborian.
He will contact you
if he finds something.
I have found the connection
to the government.
Guess who visited the Prime Minister
5 October 1976?
No bids? An Evert Gullberg and a certain
Hans von Rotting.
They were there three weeks after
Zalachenko defected.
- How did you find out?
- I checked the visitors book.
There was only one visit
5 October 1976.
Well done, Christer.
But we must prove that they were
there to inform him about Zalachenko.
- Were there any notes?
- No, just the name and date.
- How do we proceed?
- We drive to look at the State Secretaries.
- There were two working that may know something.
- Do we have any names?
One is dead and the other is
a retired ambassador.
His name is Bengt Janeryd and
he lives outside Grisslehamn.
- We should have a chat with him.
- Good. I'll do it.
I know the material better than you
and I'm more dangerous to him.
- It's just what I say.
- Yes, I hear it...
Address?
Yes.
Fucking well done.
You know full well that Gullberg
shot Zalachenko?
- You read the newspapers?
- Yes.
- Why did you not go to the police?
- I expected that they would contact me.
- It sounds a little convenient.
- I knew nothing about his daughter.
What she was subjected to is terrible.
But the prime minister was not aware of it?
Neither was I.
You must convince both me
and Millennium readers about that.
I forbid you to use
my name in this context.
I have not had anything to do with this.
What I read here is news to me.
You have only read part of it.
We have a lot more.
Everything can be proven.
I will not hang you out to dry,
but you have a responsibility and a debt.
Tell me what you know, and you will be a
confidential source. If not, I will expose you.
- I call that blackmail.
- Call it what you want.
You are talking, so I promise
not to mention your name.
The prime minister had contact with
Evert Gullberg and Hans von Rotting.
- Did you also contact them?
- Yes.
There was one more, his name is Clinton.
The same as the American president.
- Clinton?
- Yes.
How often did you meet?
About a dozen times during my time
as Secretary of State.
I got to know nothing.
Just that Zalachenko was cooperating --
- And that the information he
gave was invaluable.
Who handled the hand-over from you?
I do not know.
- You handed over to no one?
- No.
You did not report?
No, everything was of course top secret.
I had not even been allowed
to take notes during meetings.
So, no subsequent government
had an idea --
-  about the existence of a Soviet
defector in Sweden?
It sounds strange,
but it may be so.
- What is it?
- We have a problem.
I have checked Teleborians Hard Drive
and email and found nothing.
- Nothing?
- Nothing about you or trial.
The only thing that could be something
are two short emails from...
... Jonas on Hotmail.
"PSU 1 ready next week."
It is from September 20 this year.
The second is equally brief:
"PSU 2 ready tomorrow."
PSU? Psychiatric opinion?
Yes, it could be.
- No files?
- No.
He has not sent anything
from his work computer.
He must have a laptop
with mobile broadband.
- It may be hard to get access.
- But not impossible?
Nothing is impossible.
- I'll keep an eye on his inbox.
- Good. Do it. But don't call again.
- SMS or email.
- Okay, bye.
Shit!
Hello, Mikael Blomkvist.
I'm Monica Figuerola: Police Security Service
- Yes?
- I came to ask you to come with me.
It is a friendly invitation.
You risk nothing.
- Can I retrieve my mail?
- Yes.
- And a pair of clean underpants?
- Absolutely.
Torsten Edklinth.
Police Security Service
- Blomkvist.
- Go ahead, sit down.
You are probably aware
why we want to meet you.
So let's get straight to the point.
We have confirmed the existence
of a secret group, a conspiracy --
- Within a particularly sensitive part
of the state administration.
After meeting with the Prime Minister last
night, a full investigation will proceed.
Which means...?
A *full* investigation.
The result will be given to the prosecution
who will assess whether to indict.
But we must first have time to
identify those who are involved.
I understand that.
Where do I become involved?
We need to know when you intend to print.
If it happens before the investigation is
over, it could destroy everything.
When should I publish?
We can not determine that.
It is entirely up to you,
but I ask that you cooperate.
Let me say one thing..
I am pissed mad at the State
Government - SÄPO --
- And all the other fuck-heads who
locked up a twelve-year girl --
- For no reason, in a mental hospital
and got her incapacitated as an adult.
I myself am very shocked and upset at
what happened with Lisbeth Salander.
But those responsible will be punished.
But before that, we must identify
who those are that are involved.
I am trying to also.
But I also want Lisbeth Salander acquitted,
declared competant, and the authorities in court.
We can not intervene in matters of law and justice.
Assuming if I can get access
into the investigation --
- I will tell what I intend to publish,
and when.
Something for nothing.
This can be solved very simply.
We decide which employees
we will include in the investigation.
We can recruit Mikael Blomkvist
as an external consultant.
Evert Gullberg.
Do you have any more names?
Hans von Rotting, Frederick Clinton.
One is dead, the other is retired.
- Both active in the group in '70 and '80s.
- Group?
Can we give it a name?
We could call it "The Section".
Section?
All right.
How do you know this?
I have a good source.
- Can we keep hold of this place?
- I will sort it out.
I was strapped in the bed.
Peter Teleborian stood by it.
He smelled of aftershave.
I hated his smell.
I heard his breathing change
and saw his mouth move.
But I did not hear
what he said.
I hated his mouth.
It was the night I was 13 years old.
Niedermann is your brother.
Come on, Gustav! Search!
- Yes, search.
- 80-1-651, arrived.
Come in, 1-651.
We have searched the lower level.
It is empty.
The house next door was broken into,
but police are here now.
Do you need something to fall asleep?
Lisbeth tried several times
to tell the social services --
- About Zalachenkos abuse
of her mother --
- But nobody took the ten-year old girl's
accusations seriously.
To save her mother, Lisbeth finally
decided to kill her father --
- By throwing a milk carton filled
with gasoline in his face --
- Follwed by a burning match.
This was when society reacted, ---
--- But not by punishing
Alexander Zalachenko.
Instead, Lisbeth was punished.
Twelve years old, she was locked
at St. Stephen's in Uppsala.
When she came out she was classed as
incompetent and placed under Guardianship.
It's me.
Teleborian meets with Jonas
at four o'clock at the Center.
- What time is it?
- Half past three.
Fuck!
- Hello. I need to take some blood.
- I just need the toilet first.
- Yes, it's Christer.
- I'm standing near the middle of the staircase.
Yes, I see you now.
I'm just below.
Now I can see Teleborian.
Christer, go ahead. I will stop here.
Okay.
You should see him soon.
Black jacket.
I see him now.
He standing there and waiting.
- Watch him, not too close.
- No, I'm watching.
Someone is coming.
It must be Jonas.
Gray jacket, middle-aged.
I do not recognize him.
- Now they are leaving. Should I follow?
- Yes, follow them!
- They are going out towards Vasagatan.
- Follow them!
Mikael here. Teleborian has a meeting
with an agent of the Section.
- Okay. Where are they?
- At Vasagatan. Are you coming?
Okay. Yes, I'm on my way.
- Hi.
- Hi.
They are there.
- Mikael.
- They are leaving now.
Follow Teleborian.
We'll follow the other guy.
Monica here. I need information on
a car registration.
Guess who went through
the same door four hours ago.
Frederick Clinton.
- Teleborians report?
- A draft.
It needs further work,
but it looks good.
Teleborian has gone from the meeting
with Jonas Sandberg from the Section --
- To a meeting at Police Headquarters?
- With whom?
- We will see.
Jonas Sandberg was recruited
into counter intelligence in 1998.
In 2001 he was transferred
to a secret location abroad.
He should be located at the Embassy in
Madrid but they have never heard of him.
The Section is based at this building.
Six floors with Twenty-three apartments.
I have checked all the tenants
but there's nothing unusual.
Except the apartment at the very top.
Eleven rooms and kitchen.
It is owned by the company Bellona.
The owners live abroad.
- Can we get a camera up?
- Do we have a warrant?
I'll get the warrant if you make
some tea.
Never mind...I'll make it.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Am I disturbing you?
- Yes.
- I'll come back.
- I am almost done.
I just wanted to warn you that
the police will come tomorrow.
Okay.
I could perhaps postone the transfer
a further couple of days, but...
- My colleagues would start to wonder.
- Then you shouldn't.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- You do not seem worried.
- No.
I have a gift for you.
Why?
You have been one of my most
interesting patients in a long time.
If you're bored in jail, this is the
latest within DNA research.
- Your mobile...
- It's in the chocolate box.
Teleborian will write an
expert opinion.
He will report that you need treatment
at his psychiatric hospital.
The prosecutor requested this of him.
But we will hire our own expert
who has his own opinion.
Lisbeth, this is for your own good.
I do not talk to any brain-bending doctors.
I have already said.
I hope they fit.
You need to sort your attitude,
it could lose this case for us.
Lisbeth...
- Move you.
- Lisbeth Salander...
- How are you, Salander?
- Lisbeth...
Do you have any comments?
Murder Suspect Lisbeth Salander
was transferred today by police escort --
- From Sahlgrenska in Gothenburg
to Kronoberg jail in Stockholm.
According to prosecutor Richard Ekstrom
the trial --
- is scheduled to start the 6th November.
Lisbeth Salander is accused --
- Of the attempted murder of her father,
Alexander Zalachenko --
- Who was later brutally murdered
at Sahlgrenska Hospital.
There will be increased
security during the trial --
- After there has been threats
during the police investigation.
- Sonny? When the hell did you come out?
- This morning.
- What about Magge?
- He will be there a little longer.
Good to see you.
The police conducted a search of
the building the day you were taken.
They found nothing. Later the blonde bastard
came and wanted somewhere to hide.
That buddy of Magge and you.
He is not my fucking buddy.
He is wanted in the whole country.
Therefore, he needed a hideout.
I sent him home to Viktor.
Holy shit...
Sonny! Sonny!
What the hell...?
Jenny... Jenny!
Jenny!
Jenny? It's me, Sonny.
Who was it?
Nieder...
Niedermann.
Viktor. Viktor...
Niedermann...
He should fucking die for this.
He will fucking die for this!
"Lisbeth Salander's Autobiography"?
- Can anyone prove all this?
- Impossible. They have no proof.
Blomkvist is not stupid.
Erika Berger isn't either.
We must go deeper to get them.
Press the green button.
We do not have much time.
We must increase the pressure.
- Who's turn is it today?
- It's Malins, right?
Hello. How's it going?
- Are you okay with sushi?
- Not fish. Chicken teriyaki for me.
- Do you want lunch, Micke?
- No, I do not have time.
- Okay. Erika,  eight pieces?
Can I change the battery with you?
Mine is flat.
Micke... Come and see this.
It is an anonymous, but I think
it is the same person as last time.
- Have you had many?
- I got one last week also.
- Why did not you say something?
- I did not take it seriously.
We'll keep this between us,
and we'll talk more of it later.
- Can I take this?
- Yes, take it.
- Will you have eight pieces?
- I am not as hungry today.
Put them over there.
You need to come for questioning.
Yes, so we finally meet.
Ekström, the Prosecutor.
This initial meeting is more of a conversation
rather than an interrogation.
So we can try to get a handle
on these complex issues.
I assume that you do not
have anything against this.
The charges against you
are very serious.
But as the prosecutor I should take into
account all mitigating circumstances.
It is important that you are aware
of it, for your own sake.
This is a simple question.
Answer yes or no.
When you went to Gosseberga
to meet your father --
- Had you already planned
to kill him?
I must ask the lawyer again to
get Salander to respond.
So I must repeat again that my client
will decide whether she will respond.
I ask the lawyer to have a serious
talk with Miss Salander.
This is, as I say this for her own sake.
Yes...
I was surprised that she was
so small and slender as a girl.
The trial now starts on the 13th
Then the magazine will be ready.
It's got to go to press no later
than the week before.
- How can we achieve that?
- We must help each other.
You and Malin write about Teleborians
background and a little about St. Stephen's.
Approximately 30 pages. Is that okay?
- Yes, I suppose it's okay.
- Good.
Yes...
Then there was another thing.
I have received two anonymous emails --
- In the past week, and it seemed to us you should know.
Threat Mail?
Fucking hell!
Who the hell sent this?
- Have you told the police?
- I do not want the police here.
These are serious threats to Erika.
We are taking this seriously, but
I do not want the police here.
- So shall we just forget it then?
- That's not what I meant.
- I will deal with it in my own way.
- How?
The police don't care for this kind of thing.
They wouldn't do shit anyway.
Stop now! My God!
No more. Let it go.
- Next item.
- 30 pages?
- How has Lisbeth Salander responded?
- Well, under the circumstances...
- What do you say to the accusations?
- No comment.
You're supposed to defend her
and must have something to say.
Hello Elsklinger. Sitting in here?
Sorry I'm late.
It's good that you've eaten.
It is here to examine.
It is Lisbeth autobiography.
What? How has she written it?
It does not matter.
"Bjurman"?
Lisbeth's guardian?
- What is this?
- It's a movie.
You have to see it for yourself.
Lisbeth has accepted that it can
be used in court if necessary.
Want this?
- Is Lisbeth Salander well enough now?
- I think she can be heard now.
- So she is physically well.
- But not mentally?
It's known that Lisbeth Salander for several
years has been treated in mental hospitals.
You think that Lisbeth Salander
still is mentally ill?
I cannot make that diagnosis.
I have sought a psychiatric
examination to get answers.
- What is the doctor?
- It will be Peter Teleborian.
He is chief psychiatrist
at St. Stephen's Hospital.
Peter Teleborian...
what a surprise.
ERIKA. IT'S YOUR STYLE, OR DID YOU BUY SOME-
THING FOR GREGER? HE WILL BE HOME ON SATURDAY. ARE YOU AFRAID, ERIKA? YOU SHOULD
- Is it the same sender?
-Yes.
"It will now be worse,
For all of you. "
Is it one of us?
- How is Micke trying to trace the sender?
- He called someone.
It has not helped.
We must review this.
- We can not wait until something happens.
- I will talk to Mikael first.
- So I'll make a call.
- No. I am responsible publisher.
And and I've just received some emails.
I will not go behind Mikael's back.
We must stick together
and be in agreement. Especially now.
I'll call Mikael.
Hey, this is Mikael Blomkvist. I can not
take your call, but leave me a message.
Micke, where the hell are you?
I've got another threatening email --
- Now it's not just about me.
It makes me fucking uncomfortable.
Please call back straight away!
Hi Lisbeth.
You should know that I am sorry that
you have ended up in this situation.
I'll try to help you in all
the possible ways I can
I hope that we can
cooperate, you and me.
I think we got to know each other
pretty good -
During that time before.
You were stubborn --
- And unusually difficult to treat
at twelve years old.
You bit my finger once.
Do you remember?
You never understood that contact
can be a part of the treatment --
- Which creates closeness
and trust.
This applies especially to children.
Do you realize that I am the person --
- That has the greatest opportunity
to help you?
Do you?
- Hello. Are you still here?
- I called several times.
I was sat writing, so I had
turned off the telephone.
Same sender.
Christer wanted to report it to the police.
But I stopped him.
We must solve it now, Mikael.
You and I are running the newspaper.
We have a responsibility towards our employees.
This is not just the two of us anymore.
I have been in contact with one of Lisbeth's
hacker friends, Plague.
So we don't need the police?
If anyone can find the sender
it is him, but it takes some time.
He is faster than the police.
Are we talking days? Or weeks?
Frankly, I do not know.
If we assume Millennium has
nothing else to disclose --
- What can they have?
The worst is probably that
they have a copy of Björck report.
They may not know anything
about us.
But he has great credibility.
And so also does the magazine.
Can we in any way diminish
it's credibility?
Do what you want...
We have to put an end to this,
once and for all.
She phoned at quarter past three
in the night.
She had locked herself away
in a room upstairs.
- We were there 20 minutes later.
- Do you have any leads?
The police should investigate.
We are installing alarms in the house now.
Erika told me of the email threats.
It appears connected to
what happened last night.
My contact is trying to track them.
I won't get the police involved at this time.
It is time now. It's about direct
physical threats against you and Erika.
- Towards me?
- Yes, even against you.
Your silent alarm in the apartment
went off last night.
He was in there 17 minutes.
When we searched the apartment --
- We found 180 grams of cocaine
hidden in one of your HIFI speakers --
- And 120,000 Kroner in cash
in your closet.
- What the hell?
- They are trying to discredit you -
As they can't discredit the magazine.
- Is it still there?
- The money is still there.
The other has been removed.
- I'll have to call Erika.
- I think she's asleep.
- Erika.
- Hey. It's me.
I know what has happened.
- I want us to talk. Can I come over?
- No, you do not come here.
We'll have to talk about it later.
- I want to see you now.
- I have to sleep a few hours.
At three o'clock then?
At Samir Gryta?
- Will you or won't you come?
- At three o'clock. I'll be there.
- Good. Bye.
- Bye.
I'll take these three pages to the printer.
Have we not heard from Erika?
I've talked to her. She had a bad night
last night and wants to sleep in today.
- How is she now then?
- Better. Damn, I need to go.
Has she got more threatening email?
We really have done excellent work
with this issue together.
- Shall we all have a beer later?
- No, I have a meeting at Samir.
There is an uncertainty about how
many people --
-- are linked to the Section's activities.
There may be several more
people we do not yet know.
The key people we have alerady identified
and they will be arrested in a major joint action.
I'll give more information about this later.
It is ten minutes to three. We'll pause,
and gather here again in an hour.
- Has there been any developments today?
- Clinton has been receiving dialysis.
The others have come and gone.
Jonas Sandberg is probably the
only one being social.
10:30, he met with two
people at a pizzeria in Bredäng.
- Who did he meet?
- That's new faces to me.
- They look Eastern European...
- The Nikolic brothers
Tomi and Miro Nikolic. From Serbia,
but they have lived in Huddinge.
Very unpleasant types.
Sharpshooters in the Civil War.
Miro is wanted for aggravated assualt
but they live mostly in Serbia, so...
Mikael...
Hello, Samir.
Sorry I'm late.
- How are you?
- How do you think?
- Why did you not call me last night?
- What could you have done?
I called Milton Security
because I needed help.
We have to look after our people, Micke.
Samir Gryta on Söder.
Connect me quickly, please.
I stopped the magazine.
I called the printer.
This also applies to Malin and Christer.
Their safety.
- Did you call the print shop?
- I will not take responsibility for this.
- It's too dangerous.
- Shit...
- Micke, it is the phone for you.
- No, not now.
It is very important.
Sorry.
Down!
- They are shooting!
- We'll take a shortcut.
What the hell!
Down!
Police! Police!
Show your hands!
Now!
Police! Show your hands!
How are you?
Are you okay?
- Here, something to wipe your head.
- How are you?
Get out with Blomkvist and Berger
as fast as hell.
We'll go out through the kitchen.
The kitchen!
Two police officers were
eating at the restaurant --
- And recognized the two brothers. One
was wanted for aggravated assault.
An exchange of fire broke out as they
were arrested, but no one was hurt.
The two brothers are now charged
with attempted murder.
That was cursed!
Damn shit!
I chatted with Christer and Malin.
- They may leave the editorial board after this.
- No...
We could also have been killed today.
Both of us.
No job is worth dying for.
No.
We do not know if they just would kill you
Mikael, or Erika too.
But their plan was that the police
would find drugs and money --
- And associate it with a
Yugoslavian drug showdown.
- What of the other staff editors?
- We will close for a couple of days.
We'll  postpone the release of
the magazine also.
I suggest that you and Erika
have bodyguards.
No, I will not have one.
- Now we'll see how it goes.
- Have you had contact with her?
What a turnout.
I will push that Lisbeth Salander
is commited to the mental hospital --
- Failing that, the alternative would be
a long prison sentence.
Usually that tends to be reversed.
Yes, but in this case --
- The psychiatric opinion is
so unequivocal --
- I do not have any alternative.
Thank you very much.
The trial of Lisbeth Salander
starts here in Stockholm City Court --
- At noon today the 13th, in about an hour.
The trial is expected to take three days,
and has aroused great public interest.
Both the police and  the prosecutor
have prepared their case--
- and given information to the media
while the defense has denied...
Holy shit.
Is it time?
- I did not sleep one hour last night.
- It'll go well.
Of course...!
It will go well.
- So.
- Thank you. See you later. Bye.
A little more, a little further back.
I can only regret --
- That Lisbeth Salander did not say
a single word during interrogations.
But the fact does not weaken
any of the charges against her.
Thank you.
So I leave the floor to the lawyer.
Thank you.
From the defense side,
we reject all counts.
We will prove that the
prosecutor's allegations are false --
- And that my client has been exposed
to serious gross legal violations.
I will demand that my client
is found innocent --
- That her guardianship be repealed
and that she be released immediately.
Thank you.
Has the prosecutor has anything to add?
For several reasons, I desire that this
case proceeds behind closed doors.
It is about a vulnerable person, her
psychological health and wellbeing --
- As well as about material which
is marked confidential --
- And in some parts may pertain
to affect national security.
We will talk tonight.
- Well.
- It looks good.
So we shall begin by
try to get some clarity in--
- Why you went to Gosseberga --
- To try to kill your father,
Alexander Zalachenko.
Should we understand your silence,
as you will not answer questions?
I will gladly answer questions.
Then perhaps you can answer
the question.
I have not yet heard any questions.
I asked if you drove to Gosseberga
with the intent to kill your father.
No, you said you wanted to try
to get clarity in --
- why I drove to Gosseberga to try to
kill my father, Alexander Zalachenko.
It was an allegation where you anticipated
a response, an unverified assertion.
- Answer the question.
- No.
- No, what?
- Is my answer to the question.
Did you bury a axe in the head of your father?
Yes.
He was seriously wounded, and I argue
that it is attempted murder.
What do you think?
That was two assertions.
Which should I state my opinion on?
About how the axe blow to the head of your father
was attempted murder.
It was not attempted murder.
It was self defense.
Thank you.
Tell me if you need anything.
- Can you get cigarettes?
- Forget it.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How does it feel to have bodyguards?
- It's okay...
As long as they stay outside.
Erika...
I could not do it.
You are an egoist.
And an idiot.
I will be home this week.
And next week also.
I must be sure that I
take the right decision.
Yes...
Is this about us
or Millennium?
Both, and.....
... I think.
You'll hear from me.
Take care of yourself.
Damn.
Salander, it's time to go.
Lisbeth Salander's
so-called autobiography --
- Lacks any credibility.
It has a series of allegations
about various individuals --
- One story more fantastical
than the other.
Overall, it is an expression of --
- The paranoid schizophrenia
Lisbeth Salander is suffering from.
Could you give an instance?
The most obvious is of course the
portrayal of the alleged rape --
- The she claims --
- Her guardian, lawyer
Bjurman is guilty of.
- The description is extremely detailed.
- Is a classic example of the
kind of grotesque fantasy --
- That children are capable of.
Now, Lisbeth Salander is not a
child, she is a grown woman.
That is correct. Although it remains
to be seen --
- exactly what her mental level
may be.
- But in principle you are correct.
I understand.
In 1993, Lisbeth Salander was forcibly
hospitalized at St. Stephen's.
In the time she was there,
you had the responsibility for her.
- Is that correct?
- Yes, that's correct.
How many days there was she
kept in restraints?
I mean fastened in bed with straps.
I cannot possibly recall that offhand.
But not very many.
Approximately?
Possibly thirty times. But I fail to
understand what  relevance this has.
Lisbeth Salander herself, claims
it was 381 days in total.
That is pure fantasy.
It is quite unreasonable.
So, she was therefore not strapped down
with belts formore than one year...
-... Of the two years she lived there?
- Of course not.
The defense has repeatedly tried
get Lisbeth Salander medical reports--
- From the years she was hospitalized
St. Stephen's, but without success.
- Can you explain why?
- Yes, it is confidential.
- It always is in such investigations
as a rule.
The lawyer should know that.
- Here I have a copy of Lisbeth
Salander's records from the two years --
- 1993 and 1994.
Here it is clear that Lisbeth Salander
was restrained by straps for 381 days.
Attorney Giannini, how is this
revelant to the trial?
I want to prove that Peter Teleborian
is not telling the truth.
Attorney Giannini, records from
'93 And '94 can not be used today --
- To ask questions as to put
Peter Teleborian's credibility in doubt.
I understand.
I felt like an idiot.
When the prosecutor presents Teleborians
new psychiatric report, I have nothing.
She will end up at the secure mental hospital
again and I can't do a damn thing.
Welcome To Your
Private Young Girls.
- Who are you?
- Plague.
- What is this?
- Peter Teleborian's private PC.
A USB copy.
- Sorry. Come.
What's in it?
- Everything you need.
Plus some nasty shit.
- Annika, I have everything you need.
Cooperation with the Section --
- The psychiatric reports in several versions,
false dates --
-- Email correspondence, too. Everything.
- There you are. Yes, it was good.
- Here.
- The reports I never saw.
Read it over lunch.
The dates are very important.
Well, damn good.
See you later. Bye Bye.
You ended up at St. Stephen's --
- After having poured petrol
your father and ignited it.
- Yes.
- Why did you do that?
- Because he had abused my
mother for several years.
- 12. June 1993, he abused her
so brutally that she was disabled.
- She had permanent brain damage.
- Did you tell that to anyone?
- Yes, the police officers
who interrogated me --
- To the social worker, different doctors,
a priest and the pig.
- When I came to St. Stephen's
I tried to explain what had happened.
- But he claimed that I fantasized.
As punishment, I was put in straps.
- This is nonsense.
Another example that --
- Your client lacks the capability
to distinguish fantasy from reality.
- You lie, you fucking pig.
- Here we speak appropriately in the court.
Now I will proceed
with the sexual abuse --
- As a lawyer Nils Bjurman
exploited my client.
- That is not the case.
- These are absurd allegations
without any hint of proof.
- It is an example of the judicial
abuse to which Lisbeth has been exposed.
- When it comes to Frederick Clinton
he may be on dialysis.
- In the care of
Karolinska Hospital.
- Everyone here wilI get all the files
with all the necessary information.
- I repeat.
Group 1: Bublanski.
Group 2: Svensson.
Group 3: Modig.
Group 4: Figuerola.
Group 5: Holmberg.
- For questions or queries speak to
your respective leader.
- Good luck.
- So you claim that the lawyer Nils
Bjurman raped you? - Yes.
- When you went there. In that case?
- Not "in that case".
It happened Tuesday
18 February 2008 --
- And Friday the 7th March of that year.
It is clearl in my biography.
- Did you notify the police?
- No.
- Why not?
- The police have never listened to me.
- Did you seek medical attention for your injuries?
- No.
- Did you talk to someone about it?
- No.
- Deceased lawyer Nils Bjurman has never
been convicted of any criminal offense.
- He has never been reported or been
under investigation for anything.
- It is my job to remind you that
Lisbeth Salander --
- Has been diagnosed as a
paranoid schizophrenic.
- She has spent several years
at a child psychiatric clinic --
- And has been under guardianship
since she was eighteen years old.
- How regrettable it is, that --
- Lisbeth Salander has a totally
confused view of the world.
- It shows itself very clearly
in this autobiography.
- No one else appears to rupture
her sense of realism so clearly.
In light of the lack of evidence --
- We must assess the credibility of her claims
by her words and statements.
- Is the prosecutor finished?
- Yes.
- Then the lawyer can present evidence.
- Thanks
- Peter Teleborian claims
Lisbeth Salander is lying --
- On allegations that she has been
sexually exploited by the lawyer Bjurman.
- The prosecutor is of the
same opinion.
- I shall now demonstrate that what
Lisbeth claims is completely true.
- When was this filmed, Lisbeth?
- On 7 March 2008.
I used a hidden camera.
If you are good...
If you...
If you are good...
... I'll be good to you.
Are you good?
Are you good? Are you good?
It is too late.
- Stop the film!
- That's enough!
- Why did you filmed it?
- Bjurman had raped me before.
- He had forced me to perform oral sex.
- He demanded more if I wanted to
get access to my money.
- It was the only way to obtain
evidence against him.
- The only way to get him to stop.
- We'll take a break.
An hour's break.
- Sorry I'm late
- It's okay. Thank you.
- You are submitting new material?
- It is the same the court has already,
but with small, crucial differences.
- I will come to it.
- Then I give the floor to the lawyer.
- Thank you.
Yes...
No longer can you deny
that Lisbeth was truthful --
- About the serious sexual assault by
her guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman.
- A person she thought
she could trust.
As I have said, this illustrates the
type of prolonged assaults against Lisbeth.
The attacks have been both
psychological and through the legal system.
The person who has a major responsibility
for this is Dr. Peter Teleborian.
He has, in 1993 together
with Gunnar Björck --
- An emplyee of an illegal
group within SÄPO  - the Security Police --
- Writen a legal psychiatric
opinion --
- Which ensures that a dangerous witness
was locked up  --
- Thus, Lisbeth Salander, was transferred
to a secure psychiatric clinic.
There must be some way
which these accusations...
Excuse me, but I am speaking.
- This occurred after Lisbeth had poured
gasoline on her father --
- Alexander Zalachenko, in a
desperate attempt to save her mother.
- But they protected Zalachenko --
- Made sure to put a lid on it
and classified the matter.
- Instead, with Peter Teleborians help --
- Lisbeth was locked away
at St. Stephen's in Uppsala.
- It's a crazy accusation!
- I have tried to help Lisbeth
Salander in the best way. She tried...
-Yesterday, Peter Teleborian here
presented his new legal psychiatric opinion.
- Once again, it proposes --
- The compulsory detention of Lisbeth
Salander and locking her up.
- But, as in 1993, it is under false pretenses.
- That is quite...
- I must ask you to allow the lawyer to
finish speaking. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- This opinion is based on
observations of my client.
- These should have taken place from the
time she was moved to Kronoberg Prison --
- 6 October, and should have been
completed by 5 November.
- Is that correct, Peter Teleborian?
- I will call two witnesses.
- No!
- Police!
Drop the weapon!
- Yes... Do you recognize this document?
- Yes.
- It is the psychiatric evaluation on
Lisbeth Salander by Peter Teleborian.
- It exists in three versions.
- The first is dated 20th September,
the second on 1st October --
- And this is the third,
which is dated 6th October.
- You gave me the documents.
- And I have noted that the first
opinion 1st October --
- Is identical to the statement that
Peter Teleborian presented yesterday.
- Dated the 5th November.
- This is very odd.
- My conclusion is that Peter Teleborian wrote
his report and diagnosis --
- Before he met Lisbeth Salander.
- And thus, it lacks any credibility.
- Police Commissioner Edklinth,
is it true --
- That you have these statements about
Salander given to you by Mikael Blomkvist.
- Yes.
- What is your conclusion?
- That they are false.
- They were written long before --
- Peter Teleborian had the opportunity
to meet Lisbeth Salander in jail.
- They are also forged in collaboration
with a certain Jonas Sandberg.
- It is a lie.
- Is it a lie?
- No, not at all.
- The documents are dated
and there is email correspondence --
- Between Peter Teleborian and
Jonas Sandberg proving this.
- He is part of a clandestine group inside
SAPO - the Security Police --
- Which has protected
Alexander Zalachenko.
- The group was behind
the decision --
- To confine Lisbeth Salander
at St. Stephen's in 1993.
- Jonas Sandberg is one of about ten people --
- Who is now under arrest.
- He is suspected of aiding
the murder of Gunnar Björck --
- And possibly other murders.
We have evidence and multiple confessions.
- Would Peter Teleborian care to
comment on this?
- Two policemen are waiting outside
in the hall.
- They are to take Peter Teleborian
with them for questioning.
- Why?
- He is under arrest on suspicion of violating the
law on serious child pornography charges.
- Specifically, possession of 8000
child pornography images and movies --
- Found on his computer.
- This has been seized.
- Please come with me?
- Please be sat.
- The court was unable to assess
all the new information the last hour --
- But finds no reason to keep
Lisbeth Salander in custody.
- So you are free while awaiting
