what you did to me...
nor your cowardice.
Now you'll listen to me:
I' m showing you the way out,
so you can leave before I hurt you."

I'd like to know who is coming.
-Coming?
-I got no money.
Noroblem,

They also had two losses.
But they still have two"away" games.
Check the games
Bragantino's got left...
and the goals they 've got. Okay?
And check the numbers of goals
we have to make to catch u.
-So?

Mr. Raul...
How about that?
The gamewas in our hands.
Without Pelé
the Santos team's no good.
Soccerlayers' minds
are on money nowadays.
There's no courage,
no commitment!
Can lsay something?
Go ahead.
This girlfriend of yours...
is too ordinary for you.
I'msure you can find...
one that's nicer, more attractive.
She's not my girlfriend.

Be carefulwith the knife,
it's dangerous. Taste it.
Put the carrots in the center
and bring it in.
You'll go home
on a fullstomach.
The tour is to look at the tourists.
It's aline of tourists!
-How didyou find this out?
-They are there all the time!
You can't go there,

-You're making thingsworse.
I'll have to refer
this to the doctor.
And hewill confirm
what's in the medical record...
you are rebellious
and aggressive.
Take it.
It's just a tranquilizer.
You'd better be calm
to talk to Dr. Cintra.
Sexy, isn't she?
-Rogerio.
-Neto.
Rogerio, here!
I got it from the nurse,
a cigarette for you.
Is this your first time here?

Stick out your leg! I'll try a jum.
Stick out your leg.
Look! Here I come!
Didyou try to run away?
You can't,
it'sworse than arison.
-You'll be here awhile.
-The hell lwill.
If I don't see the doctor today,
I'll beat uone of the nurses.
You're just begging for"tortulina".

When my f ather finds out,
I'm out of here.
Forget it.
There'ssomething in the medicine,

When your mother visits,
you'll be as f at as aig.
She'll think you're doing better

Doesn't matter what yousay,

It can be called amachine
It can be called aCarnival
ACarnival
I think it's not worthworking for
2 or 3years as asocialservant.
-Aswe're doing here.
-And how am I to do?
It'll be as I'msaying.
Thisweek, assoon as
the results come out...
As I toldyou on thehone...
the boy must remain in hosital for
disintoxication and rehabilitation.
But how long
will the treatment take?
That deends on how he resonds
to the treatment.
Will it be days or weeks?
Months, I'dsay.
You need to understandwe're not
treating just his drug addiction.
Mostly, it's his
ersonality disorder.
In modern medicine,
everything isossible.
Please, excuse me.
When yousee the boy,
he'll show an aggressive behavior.
His hallucinations canworsen,
he might even comlain about abuse...
and ask you to helhim.
If you really want to helhim,
you must be firm.
Don'tlay his game.
-My son...
-I have to get out of here, Mom.
Today, okay?
-You've gained weight.
-No, it's the medicine.
They give us medicine
tostimulate our apetite.
-You look sowell.
-I can callsomeone...
-Don't call anyone, sit down.
-It's the medicine.
Sit herewith your mother.
Don't exaggerate,
don't beso drastic.
You're better, you no longer
look as thin as someone with AIDS.
All this is f ake,
it's hell in there.
Madmen cakedwithshit,
full of sores, it's horrific...
You have to beatient,
you'll be morewell-balanced.
-Patience? You're not in here!
-She's not a junkie.
-She doesn't need to be here.
-Me neither. Pot isn't addictive.
That's not what theaerssay.
It's addictive to theoint...
thateolewhosmoke begin
stealing tosustain the addiction.
I don't want my son
in the headlines.
What alovely,eaceful garden,
I really liked thislace.
-They 'reuming mewith medicine.
-Dr. Cintra...
is one of the best
sychiatrists in Brazil.
He'swritten lots of books.
What he does is for your own good.
He's ason of abitch!
He didn't examine me...
...and he's filling mewith drugs.
-Not drugs!
Medicine!
-Drugs arewhat you took out there.
-No more fighting.
It's hard to believe,
we'reso near the city.
-Makes you feel likestaying here.
-Go right ahead!
She doesn't need to,
she's not a junkie.
-Stothis, I can't take it anymore!
-Neither can l!
Mom, they give electricshock
to theatients, I'll get it too.
Don't talk like that.
Do you think it's easy to find
alace in ahosital like this?
We managed because
your sister knowseole!
Andwhy?
To helyou, to do you a f avor.
I'm flying alane, okay?
Let's go.
Even the devils inwhite
resect this man.
It's to keeyouwarm here.
You mustretend. Who doesn't
do that in thisworld?Who?
You have tosay you feel good,
you're not hungry...
you've got no toothache,
you're not afraid.
Otherwise, it's imossible.
No doctor ever told me
that hunger andoverty...
can lead to madness.
If you don't eat,
you get touchy.
If yousee your loved ones
without foodyou can go mad.
A broken heart can lead to madness,
the loss of someone you love...
if your most beloved
leaves you.
We must evenretend
to be mad being madmen...
andretend to beoets,
beingoets.
Go over there and read.
The hole inthe mirror hasclosed
Now I' m prisoner here
Withone eye open, the other alert
To the other side where lfell
Thisside's got no access
Even if they call me by name
Even if areturn is permitted
At my approach, the door disappears
The windowvanishes into the wall
Wordsof water dissolve
Inthe wordthirst the mouthcraves
Before it'suttered it's not heard
Itried sleepingwhole nights

Now I' llsit onthischair
Withone ear alert

The hole inthe mirror hasclosed
And now I' m locked in here
Abandoned by abandonment
Locked in fromthe outer side
Eat it, it's for you.
Don't youwant it?
He doesn't want to eat.
It's for you, Pisca...
Ednei! Someone got away!

Wilson, you've got a visitor.
An unexectedvisitor.
Come.
Your mother and I
missyouvery much.
I' ve never seen
your mother so sad.
It'stearing me apart.
Your sister called Dr. Cintra.

Your f ather and lwill ask what
to do to get you back inschool.
You're feeling better,
aren't you?
-Of course you are.
-I don't want to go back toschool.
-Why don't you?
-I can't.
Of course you can,
what do you mean?
I can't!
We'll think of something else,
I'llseak to your sister.
Shesaysshe can get you a job
as asalesman in her comany.
What do yousay?
I'd rather you go toschool.
I can't, Mom!
You can't treat
your mother like this.
She's got high bloodressure
and is on tranquilizers.
What do I have to do
to get the job?
The approach is fundamental
because inthat moment...
theersonwill evidence his fears,
his insecurity andvulnerability.
Every client is different...
and for each one the
aroach must be different.
Our first job here
is to investigate.
Who is thiserson?
What are his greatest fears?
In thisway we discover
his needs.
A goodsalesman knows
what button toush.
Do you know thestory
of Achilles' heel?
In our field, everyone
has their Achilles' heel.
Only often it's not the heel.
It can be the intestine,
the heart or the liver.
One thing is certain.
Everyone has aweakoint.
Have youseen Bel?
The girl is beating all records.
She'll be at Mario'sarty next
