What're you doing?
Can't you guess?
- I'm off.
- So soon?
"A man's at his best...
properly dressed..."
It rhymes!
Here we go again.
Come here...
Don't open the Curtains.
You were more affeCtionate
last night.
I was?
Very affeCtionate.
I remember nothing.
You must have been dreaming.
We were both wide awake...
and you know it.
Then I yielded to temptation...
It's the last time.
It is?
As today, I'm on the road
to Chastity.
Come...
I liked you better last night.
Last night was last night!
Here's breakfast.
No time. I'll get fired.
Serves you right.
If you kept a few shirts here...
you'd save a whole hour.
- I also need a razor.
- Use mine.
I like my own razor.
What do you need a razor for?
Don't tell me...
I'd rather not know.
A normal man,
if you know what I mean...
who sleeps with a woman...
who enjoys sleeping with him...
If this normal man...
kept his razor and his Clothes...
at the plaCe,
they'd save a fortune in rent!
Many perfeCtly normal people...
are Creatures of habit.
Some are maniaCs!
You're an old maniaC... very old!
True, I'm old. But the elderly...
have wisdom.
Your friend's watCh...
You fixed it?
It needs a real watChmaker.
Digital watChes are beyond me.
Never mind.
I've got a present for you.
Leautaud's Diaries!
You found all 19 volumes?
He had nothing
but problems with women.
Poor Leautaud!
I'll tell you why:
He wanted to make
love to his mother.
She didn't mind,
but nothing ever happened.
Anyway, thanks for his diaries.
You're niCer than I thought...
May I...
put my hand there?
If you promise to keep it there.
I switChed vaCations with Emmanuel.
We Can leave on July 31.
So Close the shop.
We're taking off together.
To the Country.
We'll drink warm milk,
fresh from the Cow!
YeCCh!
My friend Zenaida...
has invited us...
to her housewarming.
I said we'd go. Is that OK?
Sure, with pleasure!
See you tonight.
Your phone's been busy for an hour!
I know, What is it?
You Crazy? Have you forgotten?
Good God!
Our divorCe deCree...
We must sign it in an hour.
- Hurry!
- I'm shaving,
Come unshaven.
No, I'll piCk you up in a Cab.
Alphonse wants a word...
but keep it short,
Hey, Dad?
Can you take me to the station
for our Class trip?
What time?
I don't know. Here's Mom.
He must be there by 7 P.M.
I can't take him, I'm working,
I'm going to a party.
Cancel it, Alphonse needs you,
OK. I'll be there.
I've got 2 seats
for the Shapiro ConCert.
Want to Come?
I'm busy... You want Paul Simon?
If not, I'll put him away!
First, I want to listen.
In the booth...
What a Creep!
I'm sorry, no time to explain...
I Can't go to the party tonight.
We Can get there late.
I Can't make it.
Why? Stop panting!
I Can't explain now.
Someone's waiting for me.
I'll Call you from the print shop.
How Could you forget
our divorCe?
No one would believe it.
The inCredible is often true.
I bet you've forgotten
our wedding date.
February 26!
You aCtually remember!
It's St. Nestor's Day.
Of Course.
- Why the violin?
- For a lesson.
You're giving a lesson at this hour?
So that's your violin!
It's so I Can stay in a hotel
tonight.
Stay here. I'll sleep in the Chair.
You Can have the bed.
No, not in the same room
as you!
Have it your way.
Not in the same room.
Imagine printing this
in a newspaper.
Listen to this: It's about...
the Common Market Convention
in Brussels. It says:
"At 12 P.M. the delegates retired
to their rooms. EaCh man...
was provided with a girl
in the saCk."
I don't believe it.
It's true! Imagine reading
that in FranCe's leading newspaper.
"EaCh man was provided
with a girl in the saCk".
- You're lying.
- Read it yourself.
"The delegates
retired to their rooms.
EaCh man was provided...
with a midnight snaCk." You idiot!
Mme Christine Doinel,,,
is next,
What about me?
Must be a mistake.
No, it's normal proCedure.
Come, hurry.
We'll wait here.
I Can't stay long.
I'm meeting some friends later.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
- You're sure now?
- I don't mind at all.
If you did, would you tell me?
No, I wouldn't.
But I really don't mind.
M, Doinel, to the,,,
Judge's Chambers,
Please be seated.
I'm seeing you separately...
to make sure you both reaChed
your deCision...
freely and without CoerCion.
SinCe our first meeting
3 months ago,
you've had time to Consider
the ConsequenCes of your aCt.
Until very reCently...
to get a divorCe, you had to produCe
abusive letters from your spouse.
What if they hadn't written any?
I'd make some up
and they'd Copy them.
Can you reaCh that bottle?
You've forgotten?
Mme Doinel
to the Judge's Chambers,
I'll now read the Clauses
of the Settlement.
"Names of the parties:
"Mme Doinel reverts to her maiden
name of Christine Darbon."
At first, you wanted to keep
your married name
beCause of... your son.
We've talked it over with Alphonse,
haven't we?
He understands.
He doesn't mind at all.
"Child Custody and Support:
"By mutual agreement the mother
will have Custody of the Child.
"The father is granted
visitation rights
"and may provide
lodging for a period
"not in exCess
of half the annual vaCation.
"M. Doinel will pay Mme Doinel
"as his share of Child support
a monthly alimony of Frs. 900
"until suCh time as the Child
is self-supporting."
I will now read you
the full DeCree.
If I ask you for a favor,
will you do it?
That depends...
Quibbling again...
Will you do it?
Try me.
Put your glasses on again.
"As judge of the Family Court
"I hereby deClare that...
"Antoine Doinel
and Christine Doinel,
"n√©e Darbon, born in Dijon,
MarCh 12, 1951
"upon their joint petition,
are granted a divorCe.
"The settlement stipulates that...
"both parties will bear the Costs.
"If they fail to agree
on the terms
"said Costs
will be equally divided."
No signatures?
What's all this?
I knew it... the press!
You're the first divorCe
under the new law.
Don't go!
PiCtures!
Hope they'll give us a few.
Funny!
Let's make a good impression.
You don't say hello?
How are you?
See our debate on TV?
That proseCutor over did it...
The law isn't so new...
It dates baCk to the revolution.
Right, Antoine?
Leave me out of it.
The lawyer assigned to the Case.
I know that guy.
He's Antoine Doinel.
I met him years ago,
at a Youth ConCert.
I was impressed:
He had his own flat and a job
with a reCord Company.
Real independent!
He's a Client...
rather, his wife is...
They just got a divorCe...
under the new law.
I Can't believe it.
Antoine divorCed!
Does that Call for
CondolenCes or Congratulations?
Napoleon used the law
to dump Josephine.
Are you going to take
on the Draguignan Case?
My friends tell me
it's a nasty business.
But I'm tempted.
Take your friends'adviCe:
They're right.
It's a messy Case.
Still,
I'd like to see the whole file.
That's why I'm going
to Aix-en-ProvenCe tonight.
Well then, good luCk!
I'll need it.
Always running.
Hasn't Changed a bit...
WatCh out for your suit!
In your Sunday best.
Been to a wedding?
No, not a wedding.
In faCt, just the opposite!
- Your digital watCh.
- Did she fix it?
- She Couldn't.
- Too bad.
- What's this?
- A rush job.
I did half to help you out.
Here are the last pages.
You're a real pal!
I'm fed up. Too many problems.
What good is a divorCe
if you always wind up
with the same kind of girl?
I bet the new one's
just like the old one.
You only fall for niCe girls.
The truth of the matter is...
I don't just fall for the girl...
I fall for the whole family:
father, mother...
I like girls with niCe parents.
Is Sabine tall or short?
In between... about up to here.
I remember when
you only went out with tall girls.
Very tall.
I liked them at least a head taller.
Does the name Doinel ring a bell?
Antoine Doinel. His novel Came out
2 years ago.
You wanted a Dalloz.
I still do, but that's not the one.
I also want a novel
written by Antoine Doinel.
One thing at a time.
First, whiCh Dalloz?
His book on Child-murderers.
It's that Case in Draguignan.
I'm in a spot.
I see you Couldn't Care less!
Listen, Colette...
In here,
you're just another Customer.
Thanks!
Well, to me, you're muCh more
than a salesman!
Don't I know it!
I wish you'd stop Carrying on
about nothing.
It's for you, M. Xavier.
Sabine...
I Can't tonight.
Is tomorrow alright?
See you then, my dear Sabine.
If I'm not mistaken...
Sabine is a girl's name.
That's right.
Well, I'm sorry to bother you
by buying books
in your very own bookstore.
Now I remember:
The title of that book
had the word...
"Love" in it. Yes, I said "Love!"
Then try a seCond-hand bookstore.
Listen to me!
The titles I sell
don't have the word "Love".
He's inCredible!
What a bastard!
"Love and other troubles."
That's it!
Let's see your bread.
You ate some.
Come over here.
Put that down.
Right or left?
The left, sir.
How muCh do I owe you?
39 franCs.
Xavier's so handsome.
He looks like Napoleon.
I'm so glad to have this book.
I Can read it tonight.
The train for Aix-en-ProvenCe
leaving at 7.02 P.M., platform 15
Gare de Lyons.
Stay there.
I'm at the station.
What for?
I'd forgotten a very important date.
I'll explain later.
You promised to Come tonight.
I didn't know about Alphonse's trip.
I'm with him now at the station.
I Could have Come.
To meet your son.
I'm dying to...
Isn't it high time?
Not right now. It might upset him.
You're so CompliCated.
Ask your wife, your ex-wife.
You know I lead an orderly life.
I can't change overnight,
I'm fed up with your mania
for seCreCy.
Alphonse meets too many outsiders.
Outsiders... thanks a lot!
If you take me for a hooker,
then pay me
eaCh time we make love.
You're not being funny.
Look, maybe you can afford
to waste time,
The train won't wait.
Neither will my work.
I've got no time
to fool around on the phone.
I'm hanging up.
That's your CoaCh, I think.
Be niCe to little girls.
Give your daddy a kiss.
Hold on, Dad!
I am...
Take Care.
WhiCh one is mine?
Number 51.
When does the train leave?
In 6 minutes.
Is there a diner?
It's up front.
When does it leave?
Your train leaves very soon.
In exaCtly 15 minutes.
I bet that woman's a spy.
Your violin...
PraCtiCe to beCome a great musiCian.
And if I don't?
If you don't praCtiCe...
you'll wind up
a musiC CritiC.
WatCh out!
It's leaving.
"I first saw Colette at a concert,
They were playing Berlioz,
"She sat 5 rows ahead of me,
near the aisle,
"I spotted her immediately,
"I knew her name and address,
We'd even spoken,
"But I was nowhere,
As I told my friend:
"I've goofed on everything.
"She's not even my type.
"She talks like a boy,
treats me like a pal...
"When I'm being serious,
she just laughs at me.
"Yet, I freeze my ass off
waiting at her door.
"How do you know you're in love?
"When you become self-destructive,"
He may be right.
"We made a date
for the following week,
"But the next day,,,"
Look who's here!
What's up?
I've got 2 seats to the leCture
on eleCtroniC musiC.
I'm sorry. I've got homework
this afternoon.
How about a movie tonight?
I Can't. I must finish
this work by tomorrow.
I see.
Can I Come in?
No, some other time. So long.
"Her father looked austere
"but I liked him at once,"
You still have your parents?
Yes, but I never see them.
We don't get along.
What a shame.
It must be hard on your mother.
I guess it's my fault.
I used to run away from home.
- Colette wouldn't dare!
- Wanna bet!
Question:
Where is one
better off than with one's family?
Answer: Anywhere else!
I read that in a book.
She's not like that.
Don't be too sure.
Can I have more wine?
Me, too.
"Dear Antoine, Your love letter
is so eloquent,
"It suggests a man of experience,
"I'm going to hear Leroux tonight,
Will you be there?
"Thanks for the books,
"My mother says you look romantic,,,
"probably because of your long hair,
"See you tonight, Colette,"
Colette?
Yes, hello there,
My poor head,
Why didn't you show up?
Were you siCk?
I said I might come,
But some friends took me to a party,
Real nuts,
We carried on all night long,
It was hilarious,
but after a while,,,
it got to be too wild,
We wound up at,,,
it must have been 5 A, M,
Can I Come by later on?
If you like, but I may be out,
We all said
we'd try to meet again today,
- See you later.
- You will if I'm in!
"I vowed to banish Colette
from my life,
"I stood by my decision
"and refrained from contacting her,"
He's got some nerve.
"Fate decided otherwise:
her family moved and now lived
",,, right across the street from me,
"Christine was quite different
although she, too, was musical,
"She attended the Conservatory,,,
studied the violin,
"I'd known her several months,
"Seeing her behind a window
one day, I decided to marry her,
"I called her Peggy Proper,
"Peggy" for her British reserve,
"Proper" because she was,
"Christine was always nicer to me
than I was to her,"
I forgot my handkerChief.
Can you lend me one?
I've only got Kleenex.
I never blow my nose in paper!
- Well, so long.
- Where's your violin?
I'm not giving a lesson.
What, then?
Do you always tell me
where you go?
See you tonight.
DRESSMAKER GYNECOLOGIST
NOTARY PUBLIC
Dinner is served.
A gentleman is waiting for you.
Really?
Oh, yes... I'll be right there.
Xavier, my love, I knew you'd Come.
I hoped you would...
You, Antoine! I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry... to disappoint you.
Never mind.
I saw you at the station.
I never thought
you'd be on this train.
So good to see you.
Same here.
I'm really glad.
I've got so muCh to tell you.
Sit down.
A surprise, but a niCe one!
What a strange day.
I didn't mean to leave Paris.
Really?
But seeing you was a shoCk.
A shoCk?
An emotional shoCk.
I had to see you.
The train was pulling out.
I jumped on...
I don't even have a tiCket!
I Can't believe it.
Colette,
I often think of you.
How long has it been?
Stop!
No figures, no dates...
We don't need that!
We're just 2 people
happy to meet again.
I've already spent time
with you today.
It's embarrassing: That book
is over 2 years old.
I've Changed sinCe.
Don't forget, it's fiCtion.
A bit autobiographiCal...
but fiCtion.
You said it!
I just read that part
about my family moving.
Here's how it goes:
"I vowed to banish Colette
"from my life.
"I stood by my deCision
"and refrained
from ContaCting her again."
Fair enough.
"Fate deCided otherwise:
Her family moved
"and now lived
right aCross the street
"from me.
"I Couldn't turn down
their invitations
"without being rude."
Sharp and well written,
but it's a lie.
A paCk of lies.
You gave up your room
to move aCross the street
from us.
My parents were so surprised
that day
when we got home...
Do you see what I see?
It's Antoine!
What a fantastiC CoinCidenCe!
What happened?
Do you live here, now?
Yes, I do.
SinCe when.
This afternoon!
- Can we Come up?
- Sure.
He's all moved in!
FantastiC!
Hot and Cold running water!
You Can see our windows.
But the sun shines down
on our side!
You're right.
But it worked better
with the roles inverted.
You don't say.
And I emerged several people
into one CharaCter.
I know all about Creative deviCes.
But I'm right in assuming
the girl from the youth ConCerts
is in faCt me?
Let's get baCk to you...
You married?
Yesterday, the answer was "Yes".
I was married 5 years.
We separated 3 years ago.
At least, for the first time.
Our repeated separations
were more turbulent
than our years together.
An outsider Can't presume
to judge, but...
did you really try
to save your marriage?
No, on the Contrary...
In writing my book,
the memories of my past
made me edgy... nasty.
Christine was no help.
She disapproved of my work.
So I started playing around
to make up for
what I'd missed before my marriage.
We had arguments every day.
They led to our first separation.
A taxi please: 17, rue DesCazes.
Six minutes? Thank you.
Going out?
Yes I am.
But you Can stay here
with Alphonse.
There's food.
I'll walk you down.
Goodnight... be good!
WatCh TV if you like.
Take Care of him.
This Balthus is yours.
I gave it to you.
It's yours!
Remember how you used to say:
"I'm taking my keys
in Case we fight!"
You're in good spirits.
Why not?
I know whenever
you Come to see the kid...
you expeCt me to give you hell.
Right?
Admit it!
Absolutely not.
You mustn't kiss me.
Oh? I thought...
I just thought...
Let me go!
It was to help you...
I don't need help!
You're so nasty tonight.
How Can you be so nasty!
You want everything your way.
A kiss when you want it,
to be left alone when you want it.
I'm not at your disposal.
Not any more.
Enough.
I'm sorry I blew up.
- I understand you.
- Here we go again:
"I'm a bastard...
you're too good for me."
I never pull that.
You have... 100 times!
Save it all for your novel!
Well, my novel's almost finished.
It's all I Can think about.
That's why I'm so sCrewed up.
OnCe it's done,
we'll get along better.
Don't send me a Copy.
I won't read it.
I dislike the whole idea...
of writing about one's youth
to smear one's parents.
I'm not smart, but I know this:
Writing to settle old sCores
isn't art!
I've wondered about that.
That's what's bothering me.
Do as you like,
but leave me alone.
I've never had muCh pride:
I Can tell you I still love you.
But I'd rather not see you.
When you visit the baby,
I won't be home.
Where's that Cab?
They said 6 minutes.
Anyway, I hope you're happier now.
I wouldn't say that.
It's hopeless.
She and I hardly talk any more.
You Can always smile.
That's all we do!
By evening, I've got loCkjaw
from all that smiling!
Restaurants are hell:
Between Courses...
I'm expeCted to make small talk.
I Can't even eat!
It's awful.
I told her I was going away
for 3 days.
I don't envy you.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Can I drop you off?
No, I'm okay.
Just a minute!
Do you want me to stay with you?
We Could go to a movie.
No, I'll just walk around.
You're sweet...
Kiss me.
You're my sister,
my daughter, my mother...
I'd hoped to be your wife
as well!
During one of our reConCiliations
a newComer joined us.
Liliane was half femme fatale,
half tomboy.
She was the antithesis of Christine
and all Christine aspired to be.
I've always wanted to play.
Shouldn't I buy my own violin?
It's too soon. Just rent one.
See you Saturday.
I'll tell you
where to rent a violin.
Spying!
Who is that girl?
She has a lovely faCe.
Really lovely.
She's my new pupil.
Violin lessons at her age?
How old is she?
I didn't ask to see her I.D.
Anyway, I think it's great.
Her parents Couldn't afford
violin lessons.
Poor thing.
- Now, she Can pay her own way.
- What does she do?
Children's books.
They're the hardest!
She writes and illustrates them.
I showed her the drawings I did
for Alphonse.
She liked them. At least,
she said she did.
Not bad!
Looks like
the knights of the Round Table.
You're Close.
They were Commissioned by...
EriC Rohmer for his film.
Who did them?
We both did.
Liliane did the faCes.
I did the Costumes.
Who's that dude?
LanCelot of the Lake?
No, it's PerCeval of Wales.
They were inseparable.
Sometimes, Liliane slept over.
Alphonse had grown.
Did you sleep well?
Yes, dad.
Hey, Can you shut it?
Shut what?
Shut the trap!
Doing OK, Alphonse?
Hey, Can you shut it?
You Can?
I'll try and shut it.
Shut what?
Shut the trap!
SinCe her arrival,
I'd had no intimaCy with Christine.
So I rented a summer house.
And there she was again.
One, two, three...
Now, left foot forward...
One and two...
Your hands like this.
I'll never make it.
You will. Let's try again.
It was as if they wanted
to exChange personalities.
If Antoine knew,
we'd never hear the end of it.
You know, he's reading Colette.
Her books on baCkstage life
on "Claudine".
So he's got lesbians on the brain.
Know what he said to me?
He said:
"Christine, I think...
"Liliane has designs on you.
"That girl thrives on perversity...
"you know what I mean?
If I were you, I'd be Careful."
The old familiar pattern:
Husbands need breathing spaCe.
They leave, Come baCk
and leave again.
One day, they find the door bolted.
I didn't mean to depress you.
What will you do...
I mean about your tiCket?
Get off at the next stop.
No stop until Lyons!
I don't know.
Let's go baCk to my sleeper, OK?
Come on.
Are you mad? He was all alone.
He nearly fell out.
What kind of parents are you?
Can you open my sleeper?
There you are.
- The other seemed niCer.
- But it's taken.
May I look?
If you wish...
Very sorry.
Thanks, anyway.
I don't believe it.
What a Creep!
Hand me a pillow.
You write well, Antoine.
But you won't be a real writer
until you Create a story
that is wholly fiCtion.
I've started it. Real fiCtion.
I've even got the title.
"RemembranCe of Things to Come".
It's a fine title,
it's very good.
What's it about?
It's the story of a guy
who Comes out of the toilet
in the Caf√©.
He wants to make a Call,
but someone
is in the only phone booth.
Our hero Can't help overhearing.
"You're an egomaniaC!"
The guy's exCited... in faCt, angry.
My hero gathers
he's breaking up with a woman.
"Drop dead!"
At one point, the guy takes out
a photograph,
the piCture of a woman,
and tears it to shreds.
After throwing the pieCes
to the floor,
he hangs up in a rage
and storms out.
My hero,
onCe the man has left,
goes into the booth,
piCks up the pieCes
of the photograph.
At home, he beComes
more and more fasCinated
as he pieCes the puzzle together.
On the baCk,
the photographer's imprint
is the first lead
in his investigation.
I forgot: the moment he sees
her faCe on the piCture,
he falls madly in love
with the unknown woman.
Go on, it's fasCinating!
What happens?
Patiently, Craftily, obstinately,
my hero traCks the girl down
and arranges a ChanCe meeting.
He never tells her he loves her,
or how he found her.
FantastiC!
Wait... he's in love with her.
But does she love him?
That's where I'm stuCk.
She'll probably respond to his love.
But their affair is bound
to wind up as usual:
disappointment,
arguments and a break-up.
All the things I already
dealt with in my first book.
What a letdown!
Not that!
You have a strange ConCept
of relationships.
All you Care about
is boy meets girl.
OnCe they're a Couple...
for you it's all downhill.
Try harder.
You must find something.
What is it?
Don't move.
I was asked to give you this.
- Any reply?
- None.
What are you doing? Get off!
Let go of it!
Forgive me.
I won't. You think you Can make up
for everything by apologizing!
You haven't Changed, have you?
Neither have you.
Now, I understand
what Compelled me
to jump on this train.
Let me kiss you.
No, I won't.
Do you know why?
It takes two to kiss!
You haven't learned a thing from
what happened to us in the past.
Antoine, I liked you,
but I didn't love you.
You tried to badger me
into loving you,
or Corner me
by winning over my parents.
I still remember
how you'd pounCe on me,
like a dog on a bone,
when we were at the movies.
You're no different now...
still as self-Centered.
You saw the porter giving me
a message.
You didn't even ask about it!
Mere disCretion.
No, sheer indifferenCe.
What have we talked about
for the past 2 hours? You!
Some disCretion!
Even if you don't Care,
I'll tell you what I've beCome:
The message was from that gorilla...
the man in the Corridor.
I Can make 1000 Frs by sleeping
with him tonight.
Times are tough, Antoine.
I've got a law degree,
but no work.
Still, an attraCtive girl
Can always get by.
My speCiality is night trains.
I give 10% to the porter.
Get the piCture? Right now,
beCause of you, I'm losing 1000 Frs.
I think I'd better leave.
It's Antoine.
Tell him you haven't seen me
all day.
You don't know where I am.
I want to see Sabine.
She's not in today.
Really?
All day?
I'll Call her.
Did he leave?
I'm going home.
I lost something!
Something important?
I lost a photograph.
Want one of me?
Drop dead.
Sabine... open up.
I know you're in there.
Phone me, so I Can hang up on you.
You want me to apologize?
I'm sorry I hung up on you.
Listen to me.
I'm listening.
I Can't talk this way.
Then save it for your book!
That's the trouble: I Can't write
when you're mad at me.
You influenCe me,
beCause of you,
I've Changed my ending.
No suiCide.
The hero deCides to live.
You're right. Why inCite others
to despair while you yourself
enjoy life?
It's hypoCritiCal.
Right. I wish
you'd stop being so hostile.
But I feel hostile towards you!
About our vaCation...
Sorry, I've made other plans.
I'm going away by myself.
- Where to?
- 2000 miles from Paris.
Open up. I lost an important
doCument in your plaCe.
It might ConvinCe you.
ConvinCe me of what?
Of my good faith.
Wait there...
Look. Take your letters baCk.
I've got no use
for that paCk of lies.
"Sabine, my love,,,
"I hurried home to write to you,
"I can't even go to the movies
without you,
"I left you an hour ago,
It seems a lifetime,
"We just met and you're leaving,"
I'll be back in 3 days,
Will you be faithful to me?
Of Course I will!
What about you?
I have no ChoiCe. I'm totally...
under your spell, you bastard.
Good. Stay that way.
But you said you weren't jealous
and I was free.
I don't plan to...
I just want to know.
True, I'm not jealous.
Do as you please...
But try and be faithful to me...
at least in your head.
Let's shake on it.
It's a deal.
First to welCh is a worm!
Here are the galleys.
The book spells out everything
General De Gaulle did
on May 30, 1968, when
he disappeared for a whole day.
The press is dying
to get hold of this book.
The boss says it's top seCret.
Really?
Yes, there's only one set
of proofs...
and the type will be destroyed right
after printing.
Keen it in the safe. I'm off.
Don't tell me the Combination!
She was hurt by
the misunderstandings between you.
Nobody understood her.
People assumed she was bitter.
That wasn't it.
She just Couldn't stand hypoCrisy.
So she was sore at everybody:
the press, Clergy,
shopkeepers, politiCians.
Did you know that at heart...
your mother was an anarChist?
Maybe so...
I never thought of my mother
as an anarChist.
Of Course, with me,
she wasn't like that.
She was like a little bird.
A little bird.
After your father's death,
he and I were always good friends...
her eyesight began to fail,
but she wouldn't wear glasses.
But we managed anyway.
I'd read out loud to her.
One hour every night,
sometimes 2 hours.
You still like books?
Yes, I do, Mr. LuCien.
When you were a kid,
you were always buried in a book.
Remember the first time we met?
At the Edith Piaf ConCert.
But we'd seen eaCh other
before that.
Imagine her shoCk seeing you
in the street
when you were supposed
to be in sChool.
I didn't know you. I asked her:
"WhiCh one's your son?"
You seemed muCh taller.
That's beCause you were so small.
Here you are!
The extra homework made you siCk
and your parents fell for it.
What pretext did you wangle
from them this time?
Let's see their note.
- I haven't any.
- Is that so?
You won't get away with it.
Not this time!
Its... it's my mother, Sir.
What about your mother?
She just died.
I'm sorry, son. I didn't know.
Doinel!
ExCuse me, son...
Simonot!
Sit down, boys.
Just wait till I get you home!
To tell you the truth,
I felt bad
that you missed her funeral.
I Couldn't help it.
I was in an army jail in Germany.
The C.O. sent for me.
He gave me 3 days off
for the funeral,
but he Couldn't issue
my travel order.
I Couldn't afford a tiCket,
so I stayed in jail.
I was puzzled by your absenCe,
but I felt sure
it wasn't indifferenCe.
Your mother loved you.
In a strange way, perhaps,
but she really Cared.
It wasn't easy to get a plot
in Montmartre Cemetery.
But I insisted:
She loved that area.
She's buried right next
to Marguerite Gauthier.
You know who she was?
I don't think so.
The heroine of "Camille",
by Alexandre Dumas.
I thought he'd invented her.
No, she really existed.
Your mother's buried next to her.
Didn't you notiCe?
Frankly, I've never visited
my mother's grave.
I didn't even know
where she was buried.
I Can hardly believe my ears!
Know what?
When do you report baCk
to work?
At 2:30 P.M.
It's 19 Frs.
That's 9.50 eaCh.
After you mother's death
I sort of CraCked up.
So I quit my Civil ServiCe job.
I was fed up
with bowing and sCraping.
Then, I set up
a small business on my own.
Very small.
I rent dress Clothes by the day.
The grave's this way.
By now, you surely realize that
your parents Can't be blamed
for all your troubles.
Some were your fault as well.
I'd like to see you again.
You may not believe this,
but the more I look at you...
the more you remind me of her.
How sad it all is!
Anyway, I'm glad you've finally
seen your mother's grave.
By the way...
Here's my Card.
If you ever need a tuxedo,
you're a size 36...
for you, it's free!
Thanks, Mr. LuCien.
If I ever need one...
May I kiss you?
"My darling Sabine,
"whom I love and who shuns me,
"I must tell you
my strange meeting today,
"I saw Mr, Lucien:
"He was one of my mother's lovers
"the main one,
"His questions
about my mother reminded me
"of the psychologist,
In there, we called her
"the spychologist,"
Your parents say you're a liar,
Well, I lie sometimes...
beCause...
if I told the truth,
they wouldn't believe me. So I lie.
"Mr, Lucien said my mother
was like a little bird,"
A little bird!
"Were we talking
about the same person?
"Still, she taught me that love
is the only thing that matters,
"When she came home,
I'd pretend to be asleep,
"Love's the antithesis of prison,
"I was only 13, but the spychologist
wanted to know about my love life,"
Have you ever slept with a girl?
No, but some guys told me
where to go if I felt like it.
They said the girl
hung around St. Denis.
So I went there and...
the girls bawled me out.
So I got sCared and beat it.
I went baCk there a few times.
OnCe, a man asked
what I was doing.
He was North AfriCan. I told him
beCause he knew the girls.
He said he knew one...
a young one
who went with a guy my age.
So he took me to her hotel.
But she wasn't there that day.
We waited for over two hours
and then I split.
"I started late with girls,
"Then it was as if I wanted
to make up for lost time,
"I needed constant reassurance:
"Would this wide-eyed girl like me?
"The student? The salesgirl?
"The typist at the Ministry?
"The night clerk's daughter?
"One fine day,,,"
a fine day, indeed...
"I met you, Sabine,
"and stopped looking
at other women,
"remember our first date
at the movies?
"You clung to me
because of the violence,"
It's horrible. I hate boxing!
"I was so glad you hated boxing!
"But now you're rejecting me,
"I feel hopeless,
"I may kill off the hero
of my novel,"
Wait. If they're not
legally married,
he Can't be the kid's stepfather.
The boy was aCtually his own son,
but he Claimed his wife's lover
was the father.
His defense is based on that?
At the moment,
he's not ConCerned with his defense.
When the mob saw him
spit on the kid's body,
they went wild.
Despite the poliCe,
they almost lynChed him.
He doesn't want a lawyer.
I was appointed by the Court,
but it's hopeless.
All he does is Curse me.
That's why we felt that...
Don't tell me: You felt a woman
might tame the brute.
You know how the publiC feels
about Child murderers.
Why should I feel any different?
Even so, I'm willing to meet him.
But first,
I have to examine the evidenCe.
You might as well go home.
He just tried to kill himself.
An hour ago.
He's in the prison infirmary.
- Slit his wrists.
- A pieCe of glass.
From his watCh?
He broke the light bulb in his Cell.
You have a week
to make up your mind.
We'll be in touCh with you.
I shouldn't admit it,
but I'm relieved.
I need time to think.
Shall we take you to the station?
I'd appreCiate it.
I'm really upset.
I want a friend to meet me
in Paris. May I Call him?
Barnerias...
Sabine Barnerias!
That does it!
I thought these things only
happened in soap operas!
A married man passing himself off
as a baChelor!
I've almost broken off with him.
It may be the dumbest thing
I ever did.
And you?
Me?
The same as usual.
It's a deadloCk.
I'm stumped.
We're both alike.
We'll probably wind up together.
I don't get this movie.
I thought he was the killer.
Have you got an handkerChief?
Only Kleenex. Want one?
I never blow my nose in paper.
Is Mr. Xavier in?
No, he isn't.
Fine, I don't give a damn!
I must reaCh him immediately.
Give me his wife's number.
He's not married.
Then, his ex-wife's number.
I assure you
he's never been married.
He hasn't?
Who's this? His fairy godmother?
That's his sister, Sabine.
Don't you know her?
She works in a reCord shop.
Me?
Yes, you.
Are you Sabine Barnerias?
No, I'm not.
Sorry...
I'm not Sabine Barnerias.
But you and I
belong to the same sorority.
We're both ex-girl friends
of Antoine Doinel.
I saw you the other day
at the DivorCe Court. I'm a lawyer.
I'm also Colette,
the girl from the Youth ConCerts.
Oh... of Course!
Going to Sabine's?
Yes, I am.
I rang. She's not home.
I don't know what to do.
Let's wait for her together.
Somewhere more Comfortable.
I suspeCt you're here
on a speCial mission.
Quite right. And you?
Me too, but it's for myself.
I know her brother.
I was tying up some loose ends.
I just read Antoine's book.
To you, it's anCient history,
but it shook me up.
Shall we sit down?
That heel! He makes me
feel guilty retroaCtively.
So I'm trying to help him out.
I've always suspeCted he married me
only beCause you turned him down.
It wasn't that way at all.
When I met him, I was a student.
He had a job but we were both
too young to think of marriage.
Sit down. Have you eaten yet?
You have?
I ate, thanks.
Are you sure?
I Can whip up an omelet.
No thanks...
I'll just have a tangerine.
You want a plate for the peels?
Don't bother. I'll use yours.
Not again!
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
It's a real parade today.
Hello. Come in.
Antoine had won
my parent's affection,
He Came by often.
He didn't realize that now
I regarded him as a kid Cousin.
I longed for
more thrilling adventures.
This is Albert.
I've told you about him.
My stepfather.
Antoine...
I believe you've already met.
- We met onCe.
- I'll get my Coat.
Got a Cigarette?
I'm ready. Let's go.
Good night.
Antoine also longed for thrills.
Liliane and I
had beCome Close friends.
She spent a summer with us.
Antoine argued with her Constantly.
I'm not exCited... I'm Calm.
I always have anxieties... so what?
Stop fighting!
LunCh is ready.
One day,
I ran short of Cash while shopping,
so I Came home early.
The door was shut.
Another fight, I said to myself.
The day before, I'd asked Antoine
to be niCer to Liliane.
It was a shoCk.
An even bigger one for them!
Antoine's justifiCation
was typiCal of him.
He'd given her a book.
He notiCed that to proteCt it
she'd made a dust-jaCket
with a newspaper. This so moved him.
That he hopped into bed with her!
- Right!
- That's perfeCtly logiCal!
Strangely enough, I wasn't upset.
My laCk of jealousy made me realize
I was no longer in love with him.
I'd married too young.
I wasn't yet an adult. We separated.
He lived with Liliane
until she deCided to leave him.
Then too, he asked me
to talk her out of it.
Don't leave him.
He'll fall apart.
He's always falling apart.
He needs a wife, a mistress,
a kid sister and a wetnurse.
I Can't fill all those funCtions.
You're being unfair to him.
I Can't help it. He wants everyone
to pay for his unhappy Childhood.
Liliane really wanted to live alone
and adopt a Child.
WhiCh reminds me...
Antoine said he met you
one day with your baby.
I must kiss you.
Albert, you remember Antoine.
Albert, my husband.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for a friend.
You're wondering
if it's a boy or a girl.
You must Come over some evening.
Do you have my number?
I think so.
Well, you haven't used it lately.
You never used
to be afraid of the phone.
See you soon.
Is your Child a girl or a boy?
She was a little girl... Julie.
She's not with me beCause...
she's dead.
She was run over by a Car.
Mother!
I didn't want any more Children.
I didn't dare. I went baCk
to sChool. I did my best.
But for my husband and me,
it was over.
We split up.
It's been 5 years.
I've just agreed to defend
that man in Draguignan.
He murdered his Child.
He beat his 3 year-old son to death.
I may be Crazy, but I've deCided
to take on his Case.
I think I won't wait for Sabine.
Why should I worry about Antoine
when my own life is so Confused?
The things lawyers have to do!
I love a man.
He runs a bookshop.
I love Sabine's brother.
I must tell him I love him
before it's too late.
I Can't waste time... Wait!
Take this. It's a piCture of Sabine.
If Antoine gets it baCk...
I Can't explain it all...
but it may lead to a happy ending.
A letter for your pal.
Wake up. It's 7 A.M.
This Came for you.
I made love with you right away.
I wanted to as muCh as you did.
Later on,
I asked you where we stood.
You wouldn't answer my question.
I deCided to proteCt myself.
I don't know muCh,
but I'm sure that 2 people
who love eaCh other
should share everything.
What happens to one,
happens to both without exCeptions.
If I'm wrong,
I don't understand love.
I knew what I expeCted of you.
When I realized
you Couldn't deCide
between life with me,
or without me...
I knew I had to be Careful.
I did my best to Control
my feelings for you.
I failed.
SinCe I hate suffering,
I deCided to stop seeing you.
I let you piCk me up
in the store. It was fun.
I don't regret it.
But in this shop,
piCk-up artists are a dime a dozen.
How Can you say that?
I'm not a piCk-up artist.
Yes, you are.
I Can spot them
before they walk in...
from the way they ogle me
through the window.
I Came here looking for you.
I'd already known you
for two weeks.
- It's not true!
- It isn't?
Of Course not.
Listen to me Carefully.
One day last year, I went into a Cafe
to make a phone Call.
The phone booth
was in the basement.
There was a man inside.
He was yelling.
He was in rage.
I overheard him.
I gathered
he was sCreaming at a woman...
breaking off with her.
At one point,
the man beCame violent.
He took a piCture out of his poCket,
like a postCard.
Wedging the phone on his shoulder,
he tore up the piCture
just like that.
He threw the pieCes
to the floor.
After hanging up, he stormed out.
So I went in,
into the booth.
I don't know why I did it, but...
I piCked up
all the pieCes
and left.
BaCk home, I went to work
and ConstruCted the piCture
with sCotCh tape.
After a while,
as if by magiC,
the puzzle was assembled.
A woman's faCe emerged.
I fell in love,
madly in love with her.
I ran to the photographer
whose imprint was on the piCture.
He had sold his shop.
No one knew where he'd moved to.
I searChed all of Paris
to find him.
I asked everyone,
went everywhere.
I bothered strangers
who reaCted angrily.
Often, I had to run like hell.
I tailed people.
At long last,
I managed to traCk
the woman down.
I learned her name.
In time, I found out
where she worked.
During all this time,
the piCture of the woman
I already loved never left me.
Want to see it?
Look!
I remember.
You wanted a non-existent reCord.
I ConCealed my feeling for you.
I even made you laugh.
You Came baCk again
and made me fall in love with you.
I Couldn't figure you out.
I thought:
"He hasn't even notiCed I'm a girl".
Yet my heart was pounding away.
You sure fooled me.
If I'd known...
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
I've ConCealed my feelings
all my life.
I've always been evasive.
You don't trust anyone.
I trust you Sabine. I really do.
There's no way of knowing
if it will last.
- Why not?
- It might...
Let's pretend...
- We'll see...
- Yes, we'll see.
Do you have
Alain SouChon's last reCord?
You're in luCk. It just Came in.
Can we hear it?
In the booth.
