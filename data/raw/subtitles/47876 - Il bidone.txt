THE SWINDLE
Hello! My dear "Baron".
It's 10:30. You guys
are always late!
What happened?
Where have you been?
We couldn't find Roberto.
He's got girls all
over the place.
How nice!
It's only a few kilometers away.
We could have been there already.
Do we always have to
act like clowns?
It's like a Corot painting!
Here. Hang yourself.
Here's the map.
This is the tree.
The treasure is
eifht steps from it.
I almost forgot. Watch out,
there are two mean dogs.
Where's the ring?
I've got it.
I've got it.
Hey, what's your problem?
You nervous?
Let me see.
We've got everything.
Monsignor!
Let's go!
Good morning, ma'am.
Excuse me...
Do you mind
calling the dog?
Here, Flock!
Is here Stella Fiorina?
Does Stella Fiorina
live here?
What do you want?
It's me.
She's here, Monsignor.
Good morning.
God bless you.
How do you do,
Mrs. Fiorina.
You own this land, right?
It's a very
delicate matter.
His Emminence das sent
from Rome Monsignor De Filippis.
Monsignor!
We must tak to
you in private.
Is this possible?
Please come in, Monsignor!
Sorry about the mess.
Go out!
Sorry, Monsignor.
- Out, out.
- Nice...
Close the door.
A man confessed his terrible sin
just before he died.
It happened during the war;
He and his partner were on
the run after a robbery.
He neded up killing his accomplice
and hiding the body on your property.
Is there a tree in the
middle of the field??
Yes...
behind the videyard.
That's it.
Well, I must gather the poor bones
and bury them in holy land.
You have to help on this
for the sinner's soul.
Is it far from here?
Ne. Just past the vineyard.
What do you want to do?
Is this a safe place?
I mean, can
anybody see us?
I'd rather not
wait for night.
It won't take long and...
we don't need your help.
The treasure...
The treasure!
Right, I forgot.
It seems that with the bones,
there should be some jewelry.
Mayby the killer
wanted to come back.
It's as small treasure...
the father here has the complete list.
That's not important to us.
The deceased wanted it
to go to the landowner.
And that's you.
Except for the money needed
to say masses for his soul.
You promise me you won't
tell anybody, right?
It's in your own best
interest, you know.
If the government finds out,
you might end up paying taxes.
A treasure!
The important
thing for us...
...is to bury his bones.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven and eight;
It should be here,
Monsignor. Right over here.
Good! Shall we try?
Do we agree?
Yes.
Please, proceed.
My pleasure, Monsignor.
Careful!
I'm tired. There's
nothing here, Monsignor.
I'm taking a break.
Give me that.
Be careful, Stella.
Monsignor, come!
We've got it, Augusto.
- Look, Monsignor!
- He was right!
Poor soul!
Look at that!
Requiem aeternam...
Slowly, slowly...
Give them to me Roberto...
that's it, thank you.
That's what we are,
God bless.
So many bones!
Virgin Mary!
What kind of bone is this?
There's something here!
A gold necklace with
rubies and diamonds...
A gold brooch...
Is it good stuff?
I'd like to have it.
Well, I meant if it hadn't been
good stuff after all this time...
it would have
turned black, right?
I'm no expert, but it looks
like five or six million.
How much did you say?
Could I have
a glass of water?
Six million!
Sure, six million...
more or less.
Mayby even more.
Gold is high right now.
It went up,
you know, Father?
- That's true.
- Let's see.
Even more! It could be
seven million.
Do we have to
share it with you?
Oh, no...
Absolutely not!
It's yours... all yours.
To whom it may concern:
Regretting the horrible
thing I've done...
and fearing the
punishment I deserve...
I request that the treasure I have
stolen and buried next to my victim...
shall go to the owner of the land
in which it is found.
The only condition...
is that the owner will have to say
500 masses for the safekeeping of my soul.
Do we have to
pay for those?
Can we have them done here,
in our church?
No, no, no... I'll have them done
at St. Peter's. It's much better.
500 masses at 1000 lira
each. That's not too bad.
It's 500 one thousand
lira bills!
In case the landowner
refuses the sinful treasure...
I beg His Emminence to
give it to charity.
Do we have to pay
them all at once?
Of course,
that's the will.
Don't forget! It's a
very serious matter.
This is a murder and
you could be blamed.
- We don't have all the money.
- We'll sell the cows...
- Shut up!
- We'll make it!
We could take the ingot, Monsignor.
But it's worth a lot more...
At least a
million and a half.
Ne.
Absolutely not!
We'll find another way.
In the meantime, Father, we'll bring
everything to His Eminence in Rome.
He'll find a solution.
Shall we go?
As you wish, Monsignor.
Excuse me, Monsignor...
Can you wait a moment?
I must talk to my sister.
It's already 5 o'clock.
We'd better get going.
Fake fifty-year old
Monsignor gets caught!
He's the most scared.
There they are!
There's a man, too.
There's 400... 425.
That's all we have.
Is it alright?
- Have a safe trip!
- God bless...
- Goodbye!
- Thanks...
Thank you!
Stop right here.
I'll get off. Bye.
Bye Picasso!
Iris!
Carlo!
Hi. Bring Silvana down.
We'll eat out and then
we'll go to the movies.
We're eating now!
We'll go out. Quick!
Daddy! Daddy!
Sweetheart.
Hurry up,
we'll eat out.
What's in here?
Candy.
Candy... put this on.
Let's go.
We're coming!
Finally!
How are you, darling?
Weren't you supposed
to be back last night?
Yes, I was...
What happened?
I'll tell you later. Look!
Is it for me?
How much was it?
Do you like it?
What is it, Mam?
Let me see.
Look, Silvana.
I'll put it on.
Where are we going to eat?
Wherever you like...
let's just go.
It's very nice. What a
beautiful gift. Let's go.
We don't want to be late.
You could have sent me a
telegram. You know I worry.
What if I needed
to talk to you?
It's not my fault.
It's my job.
I'm a salesman.
We sold everything.
We were by a market
and Augusto said:
Why don't we try there?
We did and we sold out,
everything.
They paid us in cash. Look!
Is it all ours?
Of course.
How much is it?
100 thousand.
We should give 20 to the
restaurant... mayby 10...
Has anybody asked
about me today?
No. How did you do that?
We sold out.
So 10 to the restaurant,
10 to your mother...
so she'll stop bugging us...
No. We'll give 20
to the restaurant...
and we'll pay off the baker
and everybody else.
So I can go out without
everybody staring at me!
Okay. As you wish.
Here, you keep the money.
You'll see. I'll make it
last a month...
and you'll paint.
What a beautiful face!
I want you to paint!
Of course I will.
I found some great places.
We must go there. Beautiful hills.
Hi guys!
Here comes the doe.
- Here!
- Thanks.
Smoke.
Tell me, what's the best
champagne you have?
We have Gordon Rouge...
Percy Jonet...
Percy Jonet for me...
Bring them
something to drink.
Thank you.
Cheers!
Hey, who did you rob?
They asked for champagne.
Everything okay?
Do you work here?
Pardon?
I mean, you want to dance?
I've got my own dance.
Are you German?
I'm English.
You're a beautiful girl.
- Two millons.
- Two millons?
- That's a lot!
- That's your car?
Yes, yes... wonderfull.
It must be a very fine car.
You're going to
break my drums.
Listen, this is for you,
Augusto.
Look who I ended up with.
Wimps being supported
by women.
It's common today.
I was never like that!
I always had style.
I went around the world
ripping everybody off!
The world is
full of idiots.
I can sell ice to Eskimos.
Now I work
with these amateurs.
But I'll be working
again alone soon.
Shall we go?
Give me my violin!
Stop it!
It's a very
expensive violin.
I want to hear
the variations.
Okay, I'll play them.
- I want to hear them.
- You'll hear them.
C'mon, play.
I give you my word.
It's a great deal.
I'm short of
money right now..
You can have it for 15,000.
It's my wife's...
I gave it to her. I don"t
want to sell it...
...but I'm really broke.
- Hi, Augusto.
- Hello.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Are you selling it?
Well, yes.
For how much?
For 15,000 lira.
Why? I'll buy it!
- Do you want to?
- Sure...
It's yours... take it.
And if this is your business,
I'll sell you 3 dozen for 1500, no taxes.
What do you mean?
I buy them at 500
in Switzerland.
I've gotten white
hear doing this.
Can I buy you something?
Funny old man!
A Campari.
And you?
Well, a Negroni.
A Campari and a Negroni...
a lemonade for me.
Sorry about that.
That guy is
smarter than you.
Augusto!
Augusto, the "Baron" is here.
- Put it on his tab.
- We'll be next door.
- Hi, Augusto!
- Hi.
Everything's ready for
tomorrow morning.
You know, Vargas had another
great idea on the outskirts of Roma...
Hey, kid... stop it!
Move it, go on, move it!
C'mon, let's go.
Sir, please...
Good morning.
Hey, you. What are you
doing up there?
How did you get there?
Come on, don't cry.
I'll get you down.
- Augusto!   - What?
- What's he doing?
What's your name?
Hey, what are you doing?
That's my kid!
I didn't hurt him.
He was up on the roof.
Listen, mayby you could tell me
where I can find Mr. Giacotti.
Hey, where's Giacotti?
He went to the hospital.
Right, he did.
What about...
Giovanni Bartoli?
Ask him.
What do you want
from Bartoli?
Oh, it's about the
new housing project.
I'm Bartoli.
Is it the new apartments?
I applied two years ago.
Same here.
Look up Mr. Bevelacqua.
Am I there?
I applied too, sir,
but nobody showed up.
Well, the gentleman here can
explain everything. Come with me.
Hey, Pilade! It's the
new housing project!
Hey, Bice!
What's going on?
They're assigning homes.
New homes?
Slowly, quiet. Be quiet!
One at a time.
He'll explain everything.
Don't push. Stop it, kid.
Stop it. Go to bed.
One at a time.
Good morning, sir.
It's about time.
Did you tell them?
Yes, I told them we came
to assign the apartments.
The first family
is over there.
We'll get a home!
Yeah, a home!
It's about time!
I applied two years ago...
God has sent you. I'm Antonio Iuffre,
I applied 14 months ago, 14...
He's from the
housing project.
What's he want?
Can you tell me where
my application is?
I've been waiting
a long time.
- I applied too, sir.
- It's been 8 months.
Remember me, sir?
Antonio Iuffre; 14 months.
Do you mind looking
up my application?
Quiet!
Please be quiet!
The first apartments will
be assigned in a month.
We've heard that before.
I'll believe it
when I see it.
Enough now! Quiet!
One at a time.
Here are the contracts.
You sign and pay
the first installment.
What?
And... how much?
It depends on
how many rooms.
Could be 9,000, 10,000...
What if we don't have it?
Then you'll wait
for the next group.
Ada Colangeli;
how much for me?
Please, look it up.
I asked for two rooms...
Colangeli... 9,000 lira.
- I'm Luigi Perelli...
- When did you apply?
Three years ago.
- And you?
- Maria Bove, sir.
- And you?
- Catena Calabró.
- Did you apply?
- Five months ago.
I applied two years ago.
What are you talking about?
You had a home and sold it.
He doesn't deserve
any pity.
That wasn't my home.
I didn't sell it.
That's not true. You
wanted to seel it to me!
Come inside, sir. Can't
do anything otherwise.
Don't push! What a mess.
Calm down. One at a time.
Sorry about the mess.
Make yourself comfortable.
Who's first?
Ernestina Giacotti.
That's me, sir.
God bless you.
- Gino Bevilacqua!
- Here I am!
- Bove, sir.
- 8,500... Aldo Neri!
Here; sign here.
Calabró Catena...
10,500 lira.
I only have 4,000 lira.
C'mon, keep moving.
I'd like to buy something.
You don't like this?
No, I don't feel like eating.
Listen, I owe you
10,000 lira, right?
Yes, give it
to me right now.
I will... I like this.
Augusto, look,
may I try, please?
200 a piece.
Look! How come it doesn't...?
Not like that! You've got
to blow. Look at me.
I've got it. I'll try.
Blow slowly.
Here, you try, sir...
Augusto, look!
Look, it's pretty! Don't you
like this? I'll take it.
C'mon, let's go.
Yes, I'll pay and we'll go.
I want to give it to Silvana,
you know her. I'm sure she'll love this.
You're having fun it.
You're such a child!
Watch out!
Hey, watch where
you're going!
Look, who's here.
Scum! Sleazeball!
You piece of shit!
Augusto, it's me.
Don't you recognize me?
Rinaldo!
How are you?
Okay, and you?
Are you still out?
Where are you going?
To Popolo Square.
I've got a friend with me.
Get in...
I've take you both.
- You have no manners!
- So what?
We'll go in his car.
Funny seeing you
on New Year's Eve.
Good evening, ma'am.
- Tell me, Augusto...
- What?
How did you get
out this time?
Same way you did.
I see you travel
like a king.
Last time I saw you, you tried
to rip me 5,000 lira off.
And I did, Augusto.
I did!
No, you didn't.
I sure did. He doesn't
like to remember that.
Did you see? He says,
that he doesn't remember...
Luci... Luciana...
Do you know who this guy is?
He is the biggest Con Man.
His name know all italian media!
He's Mr. Timador.
He's worse than a floods!
Augusto Rocca,
pleased to meet you.
- Hey, listen.
- What?
Do you still carry
a skull with you?
If you shake his hand, make
sure to count your fingers.
There might be
a couple missing.
Look who's talking!
And this car...
Is it really yours?
Of cours, you fool!
It must be expensive!
At least four...
four and a half.
Ne, I'd say five,
five and a half.
But if you buy it in
Switzerland, it's less.
I keep my wife
and kids there.
I bought them a house
in Geneva on the lake.
The weather is great.
The schools are the best.
The Swiss are great people,
not like these people.
- Where are you going tonight?
- My friend here invited me out.
No, come to my house. I'll count on it.
After ten. I want to see you!
Thanks, but I
promised my friend.
Okay, bring him along.
It's alright.
His wife is waiting for us.
Bring her, too.
Rinaldo Russi,
nice to meet you.
Bring your wife, okay?
I live in Via Archimede 38,
third floor...
Don't be late.
Alright.
Make sure and come
or I'll find you...
Let them out.
I'm sorry...
You've got to lose weight.
Thank you, ma'am... so long.
Good night. Thank you.
- Who's that?
- I told you that already.
I'm embarassed,
I'm not going...
Don't be embarassed...
C'mon, let's go.
Come, come.
Augusto...
Augusto, here!
Rinaldo!
Glad you came.
Nice house you've got!
Come here, Picasso.
Iris, come!
Come with me, I want to
show you something...
I wanted to introduce you,
Mrs. Picasso...
- Yeah, okay... have fun.
- How do you do ?
Excuse me...
Why? Isn't this enough?
Do you see anything?
Not really...
Don't touch me!
Because, you know,
today...
I know, but I won't!
Wait a minute, calm down,
...here's a solution.
You're lucky, Miss. Here's
Mr. Con Man, my friend, the artist...
Let's hear what
he has to say.
Are you an artist?
He sure is. He's famous
for his "art".
That's right.
Yeah... sure.
- You're really stupid!
- Why?
It's a friendly suggestion.
See, Miss, we must
be very clear.
Do you want to be
in a beauty contest?
And you want to win, right?
You told us you
have great breasts...
So what?
What do you want?
- You've got to take your clothes off!
- Okay!
What are you looking at?
Good evening, Miss.
Get off me!
What's happening in there?
Nothing. It's
just stupid Marisa.
- What's Marisa doing?
- What do you care?
Get out! Out!
Excuse me...
Iris...
Iris, come here
for a moment.
This is my wife...
the lady is... the hostess.
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
- Shall we dance?
- Yes.
Robertino!
Hey, Picasso!
How did you get in?
Hi, Roberto.
You're here too?
What a popular evening!
How are you?
Good evening.
We came with Augusto.
What, the old man
is here too?
Yes, we came with him.
You mean, Augusto
knows the host?
Yes, they're old friends.
We rode in his car.
He invited us.
He was very kind.
That's too much!
They told me he
made money with...
Oh, yes...
I didn't know.
- Where is Augusto?
- What?   - Where is Augusto?
Give me my dress!
She can go to the contest.
I knew she
could make it...
Stop it! It's enough!
Marisa, get dressed!
That's life!
May I?
Augusto, you look
incredible! Handsome!
Yeah, right.
Listen, is it true you're
friends with the host?
What do you want?
Hey, what are you up to?
Is  there something for me too?
I'm your friend... right?
Something's going
to happen!
Let me through...
Rinaldo, open up!
There's nobody in there.
Open up, scum!
Open up, Rinaldo,
or you'll be sorry!
Shut up!
There's people!
I don't give a damn!
Open up!
- Are you crazy?
- Where is she?
Aren't you ashamed
of yourself?
You're just like
your mother!
You're making a scene!
The poor girl was sick.
I helped her.
C'mon, give me a kiss.
No way! Ni kisses!
They're joking. Come.
Let's drink on it.
She got scared.
It's nothing.
I'm sorry, I think you're one of
the few who can understand good art.
I brought something
with me...
Hi, Picasso!
Good evening...
I'm a friend of Augusto,
Roberto Giorgi...
We are all friends.
You give great parties.
I like this
What were you saying?
I said that you look like someone
who knows about art. That's why I...
And you picked me...
Exsuce me...
Why did you pick me?
Because you know what a good
painting is. You have taste.
Let's see what you have.
With pleasure!
This is a De Pisis!
You can see that.
Did you do it?
Nice, huh?
No, but I paint, too.
It's ten minutes
to midnight!
Turn on the TV!
I think he liked it.
Introduce me to Rinaldo!
I can do everything.
Do you think he needs
guys like you?
Get out!
Some friend you are.
You'll pay for this.
I need a drink.
Tell us how much you
got for that fire.
I don't remember.
Mayby 15, 16 million.
16 millon. Tell him.
He doesn't beleive it.
How did he do it?
You mean you don't remember
how many millions?
You need a secretary.
Luci, hear that?
Leave me alone.
I'm mad at you.
C'mon, let's make up.
I was serious.
You? With that face...
my secretary?
They'd lock me up right away.
I'd never get out.
Where are the glasses?
I had to wash them.
I've only got two hands!
Why don't you
take care of it?
Listen, I have
to talk to you.
Lunch tomorrow?
Why?
Let's get together.
I'll get it.
It's something
very important.
Listen...
I'm listening.
Do you remember
the Texas Club?
I can lease it
for three years...
in my name, of course.
I'll guarantee you
30,000 lira a day.
Are you interested?
Grab them!
It's midnight!
Let's throw away old stuff!
Let's throw the "Baron"
out the window!
I'm ticklish. Stop it...
that's enough!
You're ruining my suit!
Let's undress him.
No! My pants, no!
C'mon sweet. Come here.
I'm tishlish. Stop it!
Let me up!
- Happy New Year!
- Cheers!
Will you have the exhibit?
Yes, darling.
Anything you want!
One of these days
we'll go to Venice.
Yes... mayby.
Not mayby. You must see it.
It's so beautiful!
Silvana will ride
in a gondola!
Roberto!
What do you want?
It's midnight and you
haven't kissed me.
Kiss me here!
Stop it!
Leave me alone!
We'll open an investment
company in a small town.
If we get caught,
I'll go to jail...
It'll be in my name.
What are you talking about?
The investment company.
I don"t give a damn
about scams like that!
How old are you?
Why?
I want to know...
Forty eight.
And you're still
playing these games?
It's pathetic.
Rinaldo!
What is it?
Come here for a moment.
- What do you want?
- Come here, I said!
What a drag!
Oh, really?
Here,'s our generous host!
I was looking for you to thank you
for the wonderful evening.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Listen, there's a lady who
lost her cigarette case.
Really?
I'm sorry.
Naturally...
with all this confusion...
It's a gold cigarette case.
I don't understand.
You don't?
Maybe you found it and
kept it without thinking.
Then you'd go home...
and there it would be.
I still don't understand.
He's really funny.
You know what I'd do
if I were you?
Tell me...
I'd look for it and
I'd find it, too.
You've got a long ways to go
before you can pull one on me.
The lady wants to smoke.
Offer her a cigarette.
What do you want?
Now, pretend it was a joke.
Have you understood?
Just say it,
and we'll be happy.
So, do you want to say
that it was only a joke or not?
Well, yes... I was joking.
I have made you agitated,
just say the truth! It was a joke.
Thank you.
Satisfied?
Out!
Happy New Year!
Augusto, damn it,
this are your friends?
And you go out with them too?
Darling, check
your pockets.
Iris!
Which way are you going?
That was very smart, huh?
We'll never be able
to find a cab now.
If your mother wasn't worse than you,
she'd have strangled you at birth.
Yes, but don't
spit on my face.
Hey, guys, what are
you doing? Augusto!
I wouldn't do it
at your age.
Be cool... taxi!
Bye. Go to sleep.
Happy New Year!
Do you want to
come with us?
No, good night.
Iris!
He was just joking.
A cigarette case...
He must have been drunk.
Yes, he was drunk.
Darling, it's
New Year's Eve.
Today is a new year.
I know what kind
of people they are.
I've told you many times,
but you always lie.
You lease and then come back
with money, I don't kno from whom.
Every time the bell rings,
I worry.
I can't take it anymore...
I can't go on.
But I love you, Iris.
I'll do what you want.
I swear.
I won't go with them again.
They'll never see me again.
I'll make money.
I'll sell my paintings.
I don't believe
you anymore.
You're right.
But please believe me,
I'll change.
I swear it!
Please, Iris!
That's what you always say.
I know. But I only have
you and my child.
I only think of you two.
Happy New Year!
Where are you going?
Start the new year with us!
Come here,
Come to us!
we'll
bring you luck!
Hey, Fat Man!
Augusto!
I am here! Come!
See what a beauty?
Whose car is this?
Get in!
You'd like to know, huh?
My secret stays with me!
There he is!
Nice car! Where
are the coats?
Let me try one on.
Take it easy,
they're a bit anemic.
1,600 lira.
They look okay, but for
1,600 they ripped you off.
No, they're okay.
Next time, you go. You'll
make a better deal.
My mother fixed them up!
Don't bend your arms;
don't move too much...
It smells like rat!
Sit in the middle. Augusto,
you buy the cigarettes.
How much does this
car cost per day?
Nothing. It's my mother's.
She's drugged for 3 days and won't
wake up. Augusto, get some cigarettes.
I told my teacher that I
wasn't part of the program!
He didn't say anything.
Dady!
- Patrizia!
- Dad!
You've changed. I wouldn't
have recognized you...
...you know?
Patrizia, what
are you doing?
I'll be right there.
You don't have
school today?
We left an hour early.
Are you going for a walk?
Yes.
How's your mother?
She's okay now.
She had the flu.
You've changed a lot.
You've become a woman.
You haven't seen me
since last Christmas.
Patrizia!
I'm coming!
You should go.
I'll see you soon
and I'll call you.
Okay.
I mean it.
I promise you.
Alright.
Bye, Patrizia.
Bye, dad.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Fill it up.
Super?
Of course!
Nice place you have.
You do nothing all day and
you make a lot of money.
Yeah, right.
I don't own this land.
If you only knew, sir...
Too bad! The truth is
that a man has the right...
to rest while he's alive.
What hours do you work?
There is no rest here.
I work all night.
Really?
Oil... water?
No... Just
check the tires.
Right away.
How much?
1,380 lira.
Look, I can't pay you.
We're totally dry.
I have a meeting at 12:30.
You know what?
We'll do it this way.
I owe you 1,380.
You give me 10,000.
When I come back tonight,
I'll give you 13,000. Okay?
Do you agree?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
Yes, what do you mean?
Oh, you don't
trust me, right?
No. I trust you, I just
didn't understand.
Okay, I'll give you my
coat. He wants my coat!
It's not that I
don't trust you...
I'll give you my coat.
Is that enough?
You're giving him a 50,000
lira coat for 10,000 lira?
What can I do?
He doesn't trust me.
You hope I don't come back, huh?
Don't touch it!
Wait, I'll give you
my watch instead.
I trust you because
you're a gentleman.
You trust me because
I'm giving you this.
Good morning!
- Gasoline?
- Yes, fill it up.
- Is the tank in the back?
- Yes.
Let's see the old town!
Shut up, idiot!
Not even a woman
in this town.
Living here must
be the pits.
Ladies and gentlemen...
It's pure English wool!
Guaranteed! Pure wool!
It's the best there is!
Oh, watch out for the bull!
Don't break your neck!
He's gone.
We've got to figure out
something else.
We can't go on like this.
Who wants to
go on like this?
I'm not stupid.
This is just for fun.
I'm going to sing.
As soon as I have some
money, I'll take lessons.
I've bought all the
Johnny Ray records.
I want to sing like him.
You'll never do it.
I don't want to
end up like you!
Augusto!
Come on. I'll pay.
How much is it?
- C'mon, let's go.
- No, I want to ride them.
Let's go!
Where are you taking me?
Stop it!
Look at you!
How much would a ride be?
You shouldn't drink!
I'm sick.
It's not my fault! He had
two glasses! He's a wimp.
He drank a whole bottle.
Leave him there!
Leave me here...
You should know that he gets
drunk just smelling the wine.
- What do you want from me?
- You're having a good time!
Come on, wash your face.
Just knock him out.
It's hot!
Leave me alone, you guys...
Where are you going?
I want to ask him
something.
Go away, Augusto. Go away.
I'm sick... you two go on.
I'm going home.
You go to Florence.
Don't worry about me.
I want to go home.
I'll take the train.
You can't go anywhere.
Look at you.
C'mon, come here.
Take this off.
Walk, it's good for you.
One of these days she's goint to take
my child and go back to her mother.
You'll see
that she'll do it.
What a dumb thing to
get married at 18.
You can't do anything.
You're finished!
Listen to me...
go do something else.
Find another job.
But I'm the right
type for this.
You aleays told me that I have
the perfect face for this.
I look like an angel!
Say "one million".
What?
C'mon, you understand.
Say "one million".
One million...
See? You can't even say it.
And you know why?
Because you can't
even imagine a million!
You give your wife
every penny! Jerk!
But, Augusto... I...
People like us
can't have families.
One needs to have freedom
to come or leave.
You can't always hold
your wife's hand.
You must be alone.
The most important thing
when you're young, is freedom.
It's more important than
the air you breathe.
You're scared now...
What will you do at my age?
Time flies.
Get up and walk.
It'll pass soon.
Feel better?
Yes, it's better.
I'm not going to Florence.
I'm going home.
Come with us. We'll have
fun. We've plenty of money.
No... I'm going home.
How can you do it?
I envy you
for your courage.
Don't you get scared...
at your age?
Are you not scared?
Scared of what?
I'm not like you.
It's raining.
Augusto! Picasso!
Here's Miss Frosinone!
Look at Roberto!
See what a good
friend I am?
Wait... let's go.
Augusto... where
are you going?
Let's go! Let's go!
Picasso, what are you
doing? Hurry up! C'mon...
Look at this girl!
Mrs. Luigina, a local lady;
Mr. Augusto, our spiritual grandfather.
The lady would like
a romantic walk.
Keep your hands off me.
Everybody knows me here.
Sorry, ma'am.
What do you want?
Wait a minute... here.
I was asleep.
There isn't much time. My
husband comes back at midnight.
Let's go. It's raining.
- What does he do?
- He works... Nice car!
Let's go... c'mon.
Thanks, Amilcare.
Tomorrow...
Where are oyu going?
What are you doing?
Hey, sweet! Go to sleep!
We'll see you in the
morning. Bye.
Bye!
We're so close!
Is there radio?
Turn it on!
Have you been waiting long?
No, you're on time.
Let me look at you.
You're very elegant.
Wait.
No, thank you, it's not
necessary. Thank you...
Thank you.
It's a lovely day. Why
don't we eat outside?
Let's.
Do you have a preference?
It's all the same as long
as I'm home by 7:00.
No problem.
I'm a bit fat, right?
No, you look great.
Do you know that
I'm 48 years old?
That's not old.
What will you do after
you finish school?
- I'll have to decide.
- What?
Whether to continue
or to quit.
There are four more years;
and it's a long time.
You don't like to study?
I do; I'd like to continue.
Mom would like it too, but
I don't want to burden her.
What would you do
after that?
- Teach...
- What?
Be a teacher.
You? You like that?
Sure. I'd like to find a
part-time job to pay for school.
A lot of my friends do it.
A girl frind of mine
works as as cashier.
How much does a
cashier make?
Well, 30... 35...
- How much?
- 35.
35,000 lira...
nobody can live on
35,000 a month!
But that's what people get.
And they live on it.
Dessert and cognac.
Today young people
work for a living.
Anyway, to get a cashier's job takes
a deposit of 2 or 300,000 lira...
I don't have it.
That's nice!
Very nice!
Do you like it?
It's beautiful.
Keep it, it's yours.
It's too much for me.
No, it's nothing.
Be careful when you
recharge it because...
...it's very delicate.
Thank you, dad.
It's very pretty.
Waiter, the check, please!
Over there.
It's too far.
It's better though.
Thank you.
She thought we were lovers.
- Can you see?
- Yes.
I'll get you the money
for the deposit.
2 or 300,000 lira is nothing
for me... I can get that.
Oh, dad...
Ice scream!
- Do you want one?
- Yes, thank you.
Two ice creams!
- Keep Sunday open for me.
- Okay.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
Do you feel okay?
It's nothing.
I'll get some cigarettes.
Hi, how are you?
I've been looking for you
for six months.
Could we talk tomorrow?
Tomorrow, no! I'll talk
to you right now!
Listen, please...
You son-of-a-bitch!
You've got to listen to me!
Get out!
Please sit down, Miss...
Let's get out, please.
Why do I have to go to jail?
What have I done?
The son-of-a-bitch wants
to know what he did!
Stay cool, you
don't want to be wrong.
Cool? I'll break his neck!
Excuse me, please.
What happened?
Please, let me go.
What's wrong?
This man is a cheater.
He must go to jail.
He sold me fake antibiotics.
My brother almost died!
- Thief!
- Stop it!
Calm down, now.
Me? A thief?
That's enough, I said!
Go home.
Stop it, let's go to the police
station. You'll explain there.
Dad!
Go home!
Policeman!
Stay back!
What are you
going to do now?
I don't know.
Do you have a cigarette ?
Sure. Try not to
come back here.
Thank you. Bye.
Good luck.
Let them take my mother.
No. I won't be
in Rome this week.
The lawyer.
They arrested him?
I don't know. Forged
signatures. I don't know.
Okay.
Look who's here!
Would you like a Cognac?
A Negroni.
Where have you been?
Out of town?
Have you seen
Roberto today?
Who? The guy who's
always laughing?
It's been a long time.
Roberto who?
Roberto Giorgio?
Yes.
He went to Milan.
Since when?
Three months ago.
What's he doing there?
He's doing wel... I saw
him driving a sports car.
Have you seen Baron Vargas?
Yesterday, not today.
He still comes by, right?
Not as much.
Pay at the cashier.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Are you Paolo Gazzese?
- Yes.
It's him, Monsignor.
We must speak with you.
It's important.
Come in.
A bone!
Monsignor, a bone!
I've got the list
of the treasure.
We need something to...
oh, no... done.
What is it?
The Bank of Italy?
Come here, look!
Monsignor!
As I said...
...the treasure
is all yours.
The deceased had
specific instructions.
But you mustn't tell
anybody. It was a murder.
Monsignor! There's
a small problem.
This gentleman doesn't have
enough money for the masses.
He only has... how much?
350,000 lira.
350,000 lira.
What do we do?
It doesn't matter.
We're not merchants.
We'll take what he has.
You can return for the rest.
I'll explain it
to His Emminence.
I saved this money to buy
an animal that would help my work.
I'm not saving
the money for me.
It's for my daughters.
One works
as hard as a man.
The other is paralyzed.
Who's going to take care
of them when I die?
That's an injustice.
God never forgives anybody.
Look at the
treasure you have.
Isn't that true, Monsignor?
I'd like to have
his misfortune.
God never abandons
his children.
Do you have any money?
Yes.
Please... Monsignor!
It's late Monsignor.
His Emminence is waiting.
That's right! We must go.
Excuse us. Thank you.
Monsignor! Please...
Would yo be kind enough
to talk to my child?
No, I can't...
Please, Monsignor.
Just two words!
Wait a moment.
Thank you! Don't tell
her I asked you.
Look... Monsignor
wants to say hello.
I'll bring a chair.
No, I'm leaving soon.
Stay there!
What is your name?
Susanna.
You must have faith in God,
my child.
I know it's a terrible thing, but
one must resign himself to God's will.
This is a valley of tears, and each
one of us must carry his cross.
Yes, I know.
I don't complain.
It's them.
Them?
I'm a burden for my family.
I don't care about myself.
In your condition, and
you worry about them?
That's all she thinks about...
My daughter!
Why do you say that?
She's always working. She does
accounting, embroidery...
Look how good she is.
Show it to the Monsignor.
Look how beautiful!
Was she always like that?
No, it happened
when she was nine.
Mom... go back home.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
Nine years...
I'm okay here. I'm here
with my music...
I feel like a queen.
My sister has a hard life.
Working in the field
at 4 in the morning.
Don't you want to be cured?
It's impossible...
It would take a miracle.
Sometimes miracles happen.
I know.
Do you believe in them?
Yes, I do.
Why?
I don't know why,
but I believe.
This is very beautiful.
Are you leaving?
I must go now.
I have to go.
You don't need me.
You're better off that a
lot of other people.
Our life...
...the lives of many people I know,
has nothing to offer.
You're not missing much.
No... You don't need me.
I have nothing to give you.
Wait, Monsignor!
Don't go away!
Pray for me, pray for me!
Let go.
The hole was too deep.
I was sweating like crazy.
How did it go?
350,000 lira.
We could have made more,
but that's all he had.
We thought we'd
better leave.
Good idea.
I didn't think you'd
be coming so soon.
Who's got the keys?
He does.
Give him the keys.
What's that song?
Con Man's symphony.
Hey, that treasure
looked awful!
Even a blind man
would have noticed it!
What are you talking about!
Remember the time
it was all glass?
These people are so naive.
What an isolated place.
Would you have a
nice house up here?
Is there an echo here?
And the cognac?
I drank it all.
I was sweating and could
have caught a pneumonia.
I've got a pain here.
I told my fife and she
said: "you work too hard".
- Where is the bottle?
- It's here.
What are you doing?
I'll fill it up with water.
I drove in second gear.
When are you going
to get rid of this?
Who's got the money?
Augusto does. He's got it.
I don't have the money.
I didn't take it.
I couldn't do it, Vargas.
He was an old man with
a paralyzed daughter.
He works to leave
her some money.
This is a joke. What
are you talking about?
I saw you taking the money.
I gave it back.
When did you do that?
I said I gave it back!
Okay?
You're the biggest liar
I have ever met.
You gave back
350,000 lita? You!
I've never lied to you.
I couldn't do it.
It's not in there.
Mayby I can find it.
You were in the car while
I talked to the girl.
A poor girl sitting in a
wheel chair for 9 years.
She stares at you, she kisses your hand
and asks you to pray for her...
I'd like to see what
you would have done.
I have a daughter and
I couln't do it.
Are you nuts?
Can't I have a heart, too?
That would be novel.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
We trust each other
and we're friends.
The poor girl also moved me,
but I don't believe you. Let's see!
Don't touch me!
Let go!
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?
Come here, I was
there too, remember?
I was with you...
I saw you taking it.
If this is a joke, it's
funny, but now it's enough.
Frisk him!
I don't have the money!
Why do you care then?
Leave me alone!
You hurt me,
you son-of-a-bitch!
C'mon! C'mon...
You tjink that this is it?
What kind of scun are you?
Kick him!
Break his bones!
You want to cheat me?
I want to see you
on your knees, begging.
I'l kill you!
Where do you think
you're going?
My back! Stop it!
Where is it?
There, in the shoes.
You liar!
- Where's the money?
- Here, count it!
Damn you! Here's the money,
you coward!
Give me the money.
In his pockets, in the
shoes, all over.
The girl in the wheelchair!
You'll never work
for me again!
You won't work
in Roma again!
And you nearly
convinced me.
I'm hurt, Vargas...
Fuck off!!
Some friends! They're
leaving you here now!
This was the dumbest
trick of your life.
Vargas... Vargas,
I'm hurt!
Who did you want to cheat?
Vargas... Riccardo...
Listen, you're my friends!
Sure...
Don't leave me here.
You are young...
I can teach you...
I can...
...teach you many things.
Teach me what?
To be a coward like you?
I've got money holed away.
We'll split it!
Don't leave me here!
Vargas!
I know you're there!
Do you want to scare me?
C'mon... Vargas!
Vargas... Vargas!
Patrizia, my child...
I'm better now. I can...
Wait!
I'm coming!
I'm going with you!
