Edith.
It's been so long.
A lifetime.
Drive home with me.
Come on, Edith. Drive home with me.
We can catch up.
- Why not?
- How very nice of you.
I want to hear all about you.
Henry, Mrs. DeLorca is just driving up.
- Thank you, Paul. I won't ask you in.
- I understand.
I must get back to the office.
See you tonight.
- George, you can wait here for my sister.
- Yes, madam.
Can I bring your car around,
Mr. Harrison?
Would madam care for anything?
Tea? A drink, perhaps?
Some tea, thank you. And, Henry,
I don't want to be disturbed.
- Certainly, madam.
- Come on, Edie.
May I have your coat, please?
Depressing, isn't it?
Frank's father built it.
And the stairs are such a bore.
Duke can't bear me.
And vice versa.
Close the door, will you, Edie?
Sit down and make yourself comfortable.
Thank God that's over.
I hate black.
I don't look well in black.
You're not seeing a ghost.
Janet, this is my twin sister Edith.
- How do you do?
- I said I didn't want to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, madam.
This package was delivered for you.
Thank you, Janet.
Excuse me, Edith.
I sent this out to be cleaned
before Frank died.
For someone whose husband
was buried today...
you don't seem to be very upset.
Edie, don't be like this.
It was all so long ago.
Why did you ask me to come here?
Edie, don't be offended, but...
Well, when I saw you
at the cemetery, I mean...
- Well, look what you're wearing.
- Are you offering me money or castoffs?
Castoffs?
Edie, darling,
wait till you see my castoffs.
There's... There's this.
And this.
And this.
They'll all be out of style
before I'm out of mourning.
Here's something that will really
do something for you.
Here's the most divine one of them all.
I bought it in Paris only a year ago.
Right off a model at Dior's.
No bargain, believe me.
It's a perfect color for you.
You can have them all, if you wish.
Use this. You shouldn't smoke. It's bad
for your skin. I gave it up years ago.
- What did you drop on Frank's coffin?
- Heather.
A sprig of heather for...
For auld lang syne.
Heather?
Oh, of course.
A weekend in Scotland once.
- our last weekend.
- Yes, Frank told me about it.
Come in, Henry.
Why do you care about all this
at this late date?
I do, and he did.
Well, not too much, Edie.
Have some tea.
You never have faced the fact it was
only one of those wartime romances.
Handsome colonel meets willing
WAC lieutenant on leave in London.
What do you want in your tea?
Just plain, thank you.
Oh, Edie. It all sounds so silly now.
And how was it with you?
Same handsome colonel
on a stopover in Los Angeles...
calls WAC's sister.
I knew I was an idiot
to give him your address.
He wanted to do something nice for me.
- Where is the child? Away at college?
- What are you talking about?
The child that made it necessary
for Frank to marry you.
Well, he died when he was less
than a year old.
Poor Frank.
He wanted children.
Matter of fact, he wanted a boy.
Well, you see, I couldn't have any more.
Unzip me, will you?
I want to get out of these things.
God, how I hate mourning.
Did you see those characters
at the funeral?
Old California up to their stiff necks.
Do you know how long
I have to wear black?
Louses things up for you,
doesn't it, Maggie?
You're really broken up. I can see that.
When are you going back
to San Francisco?
I haven't lived in San Francisco
for 10 years.
Not since father died...
a wino.
- A wino?
- Yes. He drank wine...
because he couldn't afford
to buy whiskey anymore.
After he was fired off the Express and every
other newspaper west of the Rockies.
They finally took him away
in a straitjacket.
Oh, Edie, how awful! Poor father.
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- Well, I did let you know about the funeral.
- But you didn't come, somehow.
- We must have been in Europe.
Frank and I traveled
a lot in those days.
I know.
- What do you mean?
- My favorite reading all these years...
has been the social activities
of that distinguished couple...
the Frank DeLorcas.
- And seeing them occasionally.
- Where do you live now?
In L.A.
In Los Angeles? For the past 10 years?
Yes. I have a cocktail lounge
on Figueroa street called Edie's.
A cocktail lounge?
- Now, why didn't you ask me...?
- For the fare out of town?
The last time I left Los Angeles...
you met me at the station with the news
that you were pregnant...
- ...and that Frank was marrying you.
- Oh, but that was 20 years ago.
To be exact, 18.
You really hate me, don't you?
You've never forgiven me in all these years.
Why should I? Tell me why I should.
- Well, we're sisters.
- So we are.
And to hell with you!
He was a handsome man, madam.
Mr. DeLorca was also a fine man.
He will never be replaced
in this house...
in our hearts.
Thank you, Henry.
Where to, ma'am?
Figueroa.
- Figueroa and Temple.
- Yes, ma'am.
Edie's bar. Indian territory.
DeLorca territory, too, ma'am.
The family owned most all that section
in the old days.
But that's the way it goes
with the old families.
Bit by bit, they sell off the land.
But I never would have thought that I'd live
to see the last of the DeLorcas to the grave.
And me with seven grandchildren.
All boys.
And his only son died.
Ma'am?
I said Mr. DeLorca's only son died.
Ma'am, there's been no child born
or died in the DeLorca family...
boy or girl, that I know of.
- of course, that was 20 years ago.
- Twenty years, ma'am?
It's been 40 years and more
I've been driving the DeLorca family.
If they'd had a child,
I'd have known about it.
They never had a child, a boy,
when they were first married?
They certainly did not, ma'am.
- Perhaps they were away when it happened.
- No, ma'am.
That first year, the first two
or three years they were married...
as I remember well,
they never left here.
Mr. DeLorca said he'd shifted around enough
in the service to last him for quite a while.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, ma'am.
Beemis called. He told me
to say he'd be in later.
He said you'd know what it's all about.
- You look beat.
- I am. I'd like a drink.
Hi there, Edie. I have something
that will interest you.
I doubt it.
- Sweepstake tickets.
- Thanks.
Come on, now, Edie.
You could get lucky. You never know.
I know.
- How much?
- Three bucks apiece.
- You can make a nice piece of change.
- Let me have a look.
- Think they ain't genuine?
- Look, I never said that.
Cop.
- Hi, sarge. How's my pigeon?
- She upstairs?
- You like the Rams Sunday?
- Any Sunday.
Edie? Jim.
Come on in, Jim.
The door's unlocked.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday?
Oh, that's so funny.
I'd completely forgotten.
I am the type never forgets birthdays,
anniversaries or Christmas Day.
Open it up.
Don't you want to see the prize
you get for living this long?
Oh, Jim, it was so sweet of you
to remember my birthday.
I got you cigars.
Your birthday, and you're buying me cigars.
I thank you.
A watch.
Jim, you shouldn't have.
Now, don't tell me
what I should or shouldn't.
Let me put it on for you.
What's the matter? Don't you like it?
- You big fool.
- Well, does that mean you like it?
Of course I like it.
Well, then what are you crying for,
for crying out loud?
Oh, you dope.
Have a drink.
I'm still on duty.
You don't have a birthday
every day, do you?
- No, not for me.
- All right.
Many of them.
Say, I thought maybe this Sunday
we could drive out to the valley...
take a look at that egg ranch.
Egg ranch?
For Pete's sake, Edie. That's all
I've been talking about for months.
Oh, yes. Of course you have.
- Something wrong?
- No, not a thing.
- You in some kind of trouble?
- I just told you no, Jim.
Now, you wouldn't hold out on me,
would you?
Edie, if there's anything
I can do, anything.
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Then what happened this afternoon?
I went to a funeral.
Relative?
But close, huh?
That sort of gets next to you. I know.
One day you've got it made.
The next day, bing! Just like that.
- You don't know what hit you.
- Oh, stop it, Jim!
I'm sorry.
Look...
if you'll excuse me,
I've got to go downstairs and see Danny.
Okay.
Boy, am I glad
I'm not in homicide anymore.
Chickens and eggs will look just great
to me when I get my retirement.
And I don't care which came first.
It's lovely, Jim. Much too good for me.
Don't say that.
Nothing is too good for you,
and I mean that.
I know you do.
So long, Edie. See you.
Jim.
Jim, take me out tonight. To a movie,
anywhere. Anywhere! Just so I can get out.
Well, now, do you know what?
I had planned to do just that.
- You're a doll.
- Wait, you didn't let me finish.
Joe is sick, and Ben and I got the duty.
I know it's a lousy break because
it's your birthday, but what can I do?
It doesn't matter.
See you.
Hi, Jim.
Edie?
I called you earlier.
Sorry, but you're behind again.
- I know.
- It's not like I never told you.
Month in and month out, I've warned you.
This combo.
You can't afford to pay musicians.
Handouts to every bum on the street.
All right, it's your business.
All right. Rent is mine.
And this time,
you're three months behind.
Mrs. Beemis has a brother,
and he's in from Cleveland.
Been in the bar business all his life.
He's willing to give me
one year's rent in advance.
Are you listening?
- oh, yes. Yes.
- So I gotta tell you...
I want you out of here
by the end of the month.
And don't tell me you've got a lease.
Read it. You're in default.
Can I have the number for Frank DeLorca?
DeLorca Drive, West Los Angeles.
Mrs. DeLorca, please.
Her sister Edith.
Margaret.
This is Edith.
- I want you to come down here right away.
- Oh, darling, I simply can't right now.
I know everything, Margaret.
- What?
- I said I know everything...
and I'm telling you
to come down here right away.
- Would you rather I came there?
- Oh, no. No, I wouldn't.
That's what I thought.
Be here in an hour.
George knows the way.
Edith?
I'm sorry, Carl. I'll have to leave.
Janet will call you.
- You've drawn my bath?
- Yes, madam.
- The rosary, madam, at 8:00.
- I'll be back in plenty of time.
He's a louse, that Beemis.
"The end of the month."
That's the way it goes.
Dan, my sister, Mrs. DeLorca, will be
coming here in an hour. Show her up.
Will do.
I'm Mrs. DeLorca.
Where will I find Miss Phillips?
This way, ma'am.
Up those stairs, ma'am.
Edith?
It's Margaret.
Edith.
I hear you.
Come in.
A dump?
Why did you ask me to come here?
Told you to come here.
Take off your coat and hat.
Phony mourning makes me sick.
Frank is dead, you know.
You don't mourn him, because you never
loved him. I said, take off your hat and coat.
How do you like my new hairdo?
It suits you.
Well, if it suits you,
it should suit me.
- We're twins, aren't we?
- What exactly does that mean?
Tell me more about that baby of yours,
the one who died so young.
- Why are you so interested?
- He could have been mine.
Aren't you overly morbid about all this?
What was his name?
- Frank DeLorca III.
- Well, I should have known that.
How old was he when he died?
- Less than a year.
- How many months?
Edith, I won't be
cross-examined like this.
How many months?!
Seven.
What did he die of?
All right, Edie.
There never was a baby.
- That's what you want to hear, isn't it?
- That's what I had to hear.
From you.
- Who told you?
- What difference does it make?
Edie, I wanted to marry Frank
so desperately.
But you never loved him. You never made
him happy. You ruined both our lives.
I'll make it up to you. Remember?
Remember when we were children?
You were the one person I really loved.
Loved!
You never loved anybody but yourself.
You have all the time in the world
to find happiness.
You can get rid of this place.
You can get rid of it and take a trip.
- To outer space?
- Money's no object.
- How much would you like?
- You haven't got that much!
Now, sit down!
This is why I told you to come here.
- Be right out, Ben.
- Take your time.
Sergeant. She's got company.
- What do you mean, company?
- Her sister.
Well, I got to go up to see her anyway.
Edie? Jim.
Yes, Jim?
Only take a sec, Edie.
It's about tonight.
I can't ask you in, Jim.
I'm not dressed.
Well...
I fixed it for tonight.
Charlie said he'd take my extra duty an hour
from now, so we can go and celebrate.
Well, I won't be able to go now.
My sister's here.
- Edie. What's the matter, Edie?
- Nothing. Nothing at all, Jim.
Edie owes three months' rent?
That's right, so out we go
the end of the month.
He won't give her a break?
If you ask me, he is giving her a break.
Edie's a soft touch, sergeant...
and take it from me,
a soft touch is a bad risk.
Look at those crazy noisemakers.
What can they do better than a jukebox?
They're good kids.
She gives them a chance.
- They bring in the trade, don't they?
- What kind of trade?
That kind of trade doesn't drink
one short beer a night. Am I right?
I'm going up. Maybe I can help.
Remember, Maggie,
that crazy song we used to sing?
Jim. Code three.
I'll be right with you.
Good night, ma'am.
Home, madam?
Good night, madam.
Good evening.
Margaret.
We were all getting anxious.
I'm...
I'm sorry I was delayed.
Your rosary and handkerchief, madam.
Thank you.
Margaret, my dear, we have been
waiting a very long time.
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
creator of heaven and earth...
and in Jesus Christ,
his only son, our Lord...
who was conceived by the Holy Ghost
born of the virgin Mary...
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and buried.
He descended into hell.
The third day, he rose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven and sitteth at
the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
From thence he shall come to judge
the living and the dead.
You've had a very trying day, Margaret.
Time will heal, and the consolations
of religion sustain.
When you're able,
we'll go into matters pending.
Margaret, my dear.
We must pray together again tomorrow
and have a long talk.
It is not good to be too much alone
at times like these.
Even a distant member of the family
is better than no one.
Who would have thought
Margaret would take it so hard?
There is a remedy for everything
but death.
Alfonso can quote Cervantes
for all occasions.
Let us go. Good night, Henry.
Madam must be terribly tired.
I've drawn a bath for you
and ordered a tray sent up.
- Leave me alone, will you, Janet?
- Yes, madam.
I asked you to leave me alone, Janet.
Yes, madam.
Duke, you can't be in here.
You got to go.
Come on. Come on.
That's it.
Duke. Duke, come here.
Come, Duke. I'm terribly sorry, madam.
- Madam, Henry wanted me to tell...
- Would you bring me a cigarette?
- Cigarette?
- You'll find some in Mr. DeLorca's room.
Yes, madam.
Janet, come on. Hurry up.
What did Henry want you to tell me?
That the police are downstairs.
Henry told them you weren't up,
but they said they didn't mind waiting.
Did Henry tell you
what the police wanted?
No, madam.
Tell Henry I'll be down
as soon as I'm dressed.
Yes, madam.
Duke, come here.
Come here, Duke.
Stay.
- Where are the police, Henry?
- They're waiting in the living room, madam.
- Why don't you bring them in here?
- Yes, madam.
I've changed my mind.
I'll see them in there.
Good morning.
Mrs. DeLorca, I'm Sergeant Garcia.
Sergeant Haywood.
How do you do?
We're here concerning your sister
who had a cocktail lounge on Figueroa.
She was found dead
in her room last night.
But...
that's just impossible.
I was with her last night.
She took her own life.
There's a suicide note written to you.
That's horrible.
We're very sorry to have to put you
through this, Mrs. DeLorca...
but the coroner requires
that you identify her body.
Oh, no.
- oh, no, I just couldn't do that.
- I'm afraid you'll have to.
Captain Johnson
of Homicide will see you.
There's a couple of things to clear up
so he can close the case.
What could I clear up? I don't know
anything about my sister's affairs.
As far as we know, you were
the last person to see Miss Phillips alive.
Very well. I'll be ready to go with you
in a few minutes.
Edie never talked about
her family, captain.
I didn't even know she had a sister
until last night.
Dan told me she was up
in the room with her.
- When I went up there...
- I have Mrs. DeLorca, captain.
Ask her in.
Captain Johnson, Mrs. DeLorca.
How do you do?
This is Sergeant Hopson,
a friend of your sister.
- How do you do?
- Please sit down.
I know this must be quite a shock to you,
especially since you just lost your husband.
I'll keep it as brief as possible.
Just for the record, you did have
a sister named Edith Phillips?
Yes, I did.
Sergeant Hopson knew Miss Phillips
for some years...
her bartender, Daniel Lister, too.
They both say they never remember her
mentioning having a sister until yesterday.
Well, we haven't seen each other
since I married Mr. DeLorca.
You obviously were twins.
Yes, sergeant.
Your sister left a note addressed to Maggie.
That would be you, wouldn't it?
Yes.
Would you mind?
I mean, if it's not personal.
No, of course not.
"Not worth the effort anymore"?
Why would she say that, Mrs. DeLorca?
I don't know.
She asked me to come and see her
last night, and I went.
She told me she had financial problems.
But when I offered to help her, she refused.
But why did Edie go
to your husband's funeral?
She loved him once, very much.
A long time ago, about 20 years ago.
You think his death upset her so much
she committed suicide?
I don't know.
Well, who ever really does
in these cases?
I guess we can mark this closed.
- You told Mrs. DeLorca about the morgue?
- Oh, yes, I did.
Just a formality. Thank you very much.
I'll take Mrs. DeLorca to the coroner.
Mrs. DeLorca, is this your sister,
Edith Phillips?
Yes.
Let me get you a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Well, you look so much like Edie.
Well, we were twins.
Yesterday...
only last night, there she was,
talking about what we'd do on my day off.
All upset because I had extra duty,
and I couldn't take her out like she felt like.
She must've wanted to get out
real bad last night.
Get away from the place.
Last night...
For the first time, last night...
I had a feeling
she really hated that bar.
Anywhere, she said. Anywhere,
movies, anywhere, just to get out!
I was there when she took in her first buck.
We framed it, hung it behind the bar.
Oh, I can remember it like yesterday.
You keep thinking and thinking,
every possible angle.
What you might have done
that would've made a difference.
- You loved her?
- I wanted to marry her.
Did you tell her?
Well, I believe she knew. It...
Well, she must've known.
It was sort of understood.
Maybe she did, sergeant.
Well, I'm pretty sure she would have agreed
once I got my retirement and settled down.
Why did she do it?
It just wasn't like Edie,
three months' rent.
Now, how could she do a thing
like that for three months' rent?!
Excuse me.
The personal property, Mrs. DeLorca.
Thank you.
- Maybe you'd like these, sergeant.
- God, no.
Excuse me, I...
I'm... No.
You're right.
It's better to forget her.
She's dead.
Madam.
Mrs. Marshall called twice
while you were out.
Thank you, Henry.
- Have you had luncheon, madam?
- No, I'll just have a drink in my room.
The usual?
- The usual.
- Yes, madam.
- Where did those come from?
- They were just delivered.
Madam, you remember. You ordered them
just before Mr. DeLorca passed away.
Oh, yes, I forgot.
Janet, I need some ashtrays.
I'll tell Henry.
Oh, thank you.
- Does madam want these put away?
- Yes, please.
- Madam did say to put these away.
- Yes.
- Now, what do you want?
- The jewelry box, madam.
These were my sister's.
She committed suicide last night.
I'm so sorry.
That's why the police came this morning.
Would you like them, Janet?
Oh, no, madam. Thank you very much.
- Your drink, madam.
- Come in, Henry.
Thank you, Henry.
Janet?
- Leave me alone for a while.
- Yes, madam.
Put all that away later.
Yes?
Who?
Well, I'll be down in a little while.
I'm taking a bath.
Dona Anna,
do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I hear a new trial
has been put upon you.
I had no idea you had a sister.
How very distressing.
Tell me about it, Margaret.
Well, there's really nothing to tell.
I don't know why she did it.
Are you sure she really
took her own life, my dear?
- Couldn't it have been an accident?
- Oh, no. It wasn't an accident.
One is so tempted to grasp at any straw
when the immortal soul is in the balance.
Thank God our dear Francesco
was granted the mercy of a happy death.
Was he prepared, do you think?
With a heart condition, I suppose
he must've known that sooner or later...
And yet he took up
that ridiculous sport, golf.
Do you remember when my cousin,
the tennis player...?
Oh, what was his name?
- Help me, help me.
- How stupid of me, Dona Anna.
- I'm sure you would like some tea.
- No, thank you. Later, perhaps.
Hi, Henry. Maggie, darling. Forgive us
for not coming to the cemetery yesterday...
but Tom has a phobia about cemeteries.
Besides, we had to go to this party
in Pasadena, at the Taylors.
Darling, it was absolutely mad.
You wouldn't believe
some of the things that went on.
You must be Dona Anna.
I'm Didi Marshall.
- How do you do?
- What happened this morning?
I thought we had a date.
I called you at least a dozen times.
I had to see you
before I leave for Jamaica.
Where were you?
- At the morgue.
- The morgue?
What do you mean, morgue? What for?
Well, my sister committed suicide
last night.
Your sister? What sister?
Oh, Maggie, what a hell of a thing
to happen right on top of Frank.
How did it happen?
No. No, no. Don't tell me.
I don't want to be haunted
all the time I'm away.
Well, I guess I better shove off.
I still have loads of packing to do.
You know, this mourning bit doesn't
suit you. Shed it before I get back.
Bye-bye. I'll write you
as soon as I get there, darling.
And I'll phone you
the minute I get back.
Don't be too, too lonesome, sweetie.
Oh, never mind, Henry.
I think I'm still young enough
to open a door myself.
Well, adios, darling,
or whatever they say down there.
A thoroughly objectionable person.
We were talking about Cousin Ricardo.
That was the name we couldn't remember.
Now, my dear...
I think we should pray for Frank
and your unhappy sister.
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.
- Yes?
- Hello, Margaret.
This is Paul Harrison.
Did I disturb you?
- I was asleep.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, but it's only 8:30.
But sleep is the best medicine.
Margaret, I haven't bothered you till now,
but there are quite a few papers...
connected with the estate that need your
signature. May I bring them over?
- Well, when?
- Tomorrow morning about 11.
Well, that will be all right.
Good night, Paul.
Too bad I called
and woke you last night.
This might not have happened.
It wouldn't have mattered
when you called.
It's gotten so I'm afraid to turn around
for fear of what will happen next.
Oh, just one of those rough patches,
Margaret.
Things will look better in a few months.
As you see, I've started smoking again.
- Thank you.
- The court is allowing you $3000 a month...
until the probate is completed.
By the way, Frank bequeathed $50,000
to your sister Edith.
- 50,000 to Edith?
- It was in one of the codicils.
This bequest, of course,
reverts to the estate now.
Did the doctor say how soon your hand
will be in shape?
He said it'd be at least two months
before I could play golf again.
I imagine you wouldn't play in any case
for some time.
However, I was thinking
of your signatures.
My hen tracks.
Not going to be a problem to you?
Legally, I mean.
Not at all. I witnessed it.
But you should register your new signature
with the bank, then there'll be no problem.
Nothing to worry about, Margaret.
Nothing at all.
Goodbye.
Forgive me, madam.
- What is it, Henry?
- Sergeant Hopson.
I showed him into the reception.
What did he want to see me about?
He said it's personal.
Excuse me.
Henry, bring in the tea.
What time is it?
Backward, turn backward
O time, in your flight
5:23 p.m.
Henry said you wanted to see me,
Sergeant Hopson.
Yes, I did.
Good afternoon.
- Say, what happened to your hand?
- A burn, nothing serious.
I just wanted to tell you
that they closed Edie's bar Saturday.
- What has that to do with me?
- Well, the barkeep, Dan, gave me this...
saying that it was Edie's.
It was the first buck Edie took in.
I just thought maybe
you'd like to have it.
A very nice thought, sergeant...
but I'd rather you kept it.
Thank you.
Mrs. DeLorca, there is one more thing.
About the grave, Edie's grave.
I was out there Sunday.
- There's no stone.
- That is no concern of yours, sergeant.
I beg your pardon, Mrs. DeLorca.
I loved Edie.
And if it's all right with you,
I'd like to buy a stone.
My sister was fortunate to be so loved.
I'll attend to it at the proper time.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Maggie!
- Didi.
- Mrs. Marshall, we shall lose the fitting.
- I'll only be a minute. Maggie.
I've been home for two weeks,
and every time I call...
I get the "madam isn't here" routine.
What gives?
- Shall we send them?
- No, I'll take them with me. Thank you.
Honestly, darling, I think they've
got you on the ropes.
You've even started smoking again.
- Never underestimate the DeLorca crowd.
- Mrs. Marshall, please.
Just a minute. She terrifies me.
Tom and I are giving a "home again" party
Wednesday. You've got to come.
- oh, Didi, I...
- There won't be a DeLorca in sight.
We'll expect you.
Oh, cocktails at 7, dinner at 8.
- Hello, Maggie.
- Hello.
- Maggie! I'm glad Didi got you to come.
- Oh, hello, Tom.
Very happy to see you.
Scotch on the rocks for Mrs. DeLorca!
- You look great.
- Thank you.
You're a naughty girl.
I've phoned so many times,
and you've never called back.
I've got great news. Didi's Billy Boy
won at Hollywood Park yesterday.
- oh, how wonderful. Thank you.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Congratulations.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Cheers to Billy Boy.
Darling! I've been on pins and needles
waiting for you to get here.
You look absolutely divine.
You'll have to excuse us,
but I insist that she mix and mingle.
- She's got a lot of catching up to do.
- Sit with us at dinner?
- Love to, if Didi permits.
- Good.
I've got so much to tell you
about Montego. Tom's so cute.
Played gin all the time,
and guess what I did all the time.
Hi, Maggie, beautiful.
You remember Florence,
my date at the gala in Cannes last year.
- of course I remember.
- How nice to see you again.
- Come along. See you later.
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.
- I've got a surprise for you, sweetie.
Tony.
Let me look at you.
It's been a long time, Maggie.
Must've been rough.
Did you get my orchid?
Yes.
Oh, what a time you must have had.
It felt awful leaving you
to face it alone.
Three months.
I called the house when I got in.
Got a royal brush from Henry.
Well, I haven't been taking any calls.
You've no idea what it's like
to be in mourning if you're a DeLorca.
To hell with it.
I forgot how to spell the name.
- Let's go.
- Why, I can't. I've just arrived.
All right. We leave in an hour.
Well, not tonight, Tony.
Harrison's coming over
to go over some legal papers.
- Nice timing.
- Well, I didn't know you were coming home.
- I must get back to the party.
- Maggie...
Are we in good shape?
In very good shape.
- What time tomorrow?
- Well, phone me in the morning.
- I'll have Henry put you through.
- Maggie...
From now on, it's you and me.
Of course.
- Mr. Collins.
- Hello, Henry. How's tricks?
- Are you expected?
- Very expected.
- Tell her I'm here.
- Yes, sir.
Shall I pack a raincoat?
Yes. Janet, call Mr. Harrison's office,
see if he's back yet.
Yes, madam.
Yes?
Tell Mr. Collins he'll have to wait.
I'm not dressed yet.
Mr. Harrison, please. For Mrs. DeLorca.
- He's still out of town, madam.
- I'll take it.
Thank you.
This is Margaret DeLorca.
Mr. Harrison's housekeeper told me
he was expected back today.
Well, do you know where I can reach him?
I must talk to him before I go to Europe.
Well, give me his partner, then.
Well, if either of them get back,
have them call me immediately.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Collins. Madam isn't quite ready.
She will be down as soon as possible.
Well, tell her I'll be down
at the practice green.
- oh, are the clubs in the usual place?
- Yes, sir.
Sorry I was so long.
That's all right.
If I could only do that in a match
when I need it.
How's my girl?
Come and sit down.
Knowing your passion for kilts...
I got you a present in Scotland.
I can't believe it, Maggie.
- You, smoking?
- I used to smoke years ago.
Did you?
Come on, open it.
I found it in a little inn
on the way up to St. Andrews.
Oh, that inn.
We'll have to go there,
you and me, baby.
They say that heather's good luck.
Look, I had your name
engraved on the back, see?
- How'd you manage that?
- Oh, nothing serious. Just a burn.
Poor baby.
Duke!
Duke?
Go on, go on. That's a boy, go on.
When did you two fall in love?
Since Frank died,
he's been lonely and friendly.
Competition?
- Tony, the servants!
- Who cares?
The only thing I care about
right now is you...
and a Maserati, in that order.
- Immediate delivery.
- Tony.
I'm going to Europe.
- Great. When do we leave?
- I'm going alone.
You gotta be kidding.
You can't go without me.
Sergeant Hopson to see you, madam.
Will you see him out there?
Sergeant Hopson?
- Yes, Henry. Send him out here.
- Very well, madam.
Who is Sergeant Hopson?
A friend of my sister's.
Maggie, what's eating you?
You're not yourself.
Something wrong?
Something I should know?
Oh, no, there's nothing wrong.
You're not trying to unload me, are you?
Oh, Tony, now, don't be ridiculous.
Well, I hope I'm not butting in,
Mrs. DeLorca.
Sergeant Hopson, Mr. Collins.
Hello.
- What did you want to see me about?
- Well, I saw the stone...
and it looks very nice. Real nice, now.
Will somebody clue me in?
What stone is this?
The headstone on my sister's grave.
When did she die?
The day of the funeral.
That is, Mr. DeLorca's funeral.
That must have been rough on you,
Maggie.
- What did she die of?
- She committed suicide.
Well, I'll be getting along.
I just wanted to say thank you and that...
I'm sorry I spoke out of turn
the other day.
Quite all right, sergeant.
Mrs. DeLorca?
Something's been on my mind.
The night you were down there with Edie...
did she say anything about me?
What night was that?
The night she committed suicide.
She said nothing about marrying me?
No, sergeant.
Well, maybe if I'd just
laid it on the line.
Look, I'm sorry if I've disturbed you.
Sorry.
Would you have some lemonade, Tony?
What was your sister's name?
Edith.
Was that the twin sister
who lived in San Francisco?
Yes. She moved to Los Angeles
a few years ago.
Oh, Tony, I'd like
to forget all about it.
I'll make you forget.
Tony.
You don't want me to make love to you.
I don't understand, after all the fun we had.
Honolulu, Nassau, Miami.
It was fun, wasn't it?
Well, of course.
You're not Margaret, you're Edith! Maggie
and I never went to any of those places.
Never! You killed her.
The smoking, the dog. You killed her!
- Get your hands off.
- Just take it easy.
Get them off!
- Do you want to file a complaint?
- Oh, no, sergeant. Please go.
Whatever you say.
We got a few things to talk over,
Mrs. DeLorca.
I'm gonna take you
for everything you've got.
For openers, the Maserati convertible,
14 grand plus tax and license.
The estate will be in probate for a year.
I only have my living expenses.
Oh, you overlooked
the DeLorca rock pile.
The diamonds, the emeralds.
And those pearls that looked so beautiful
when Maggie wore them.
Let's start with that ring.
The bracelet.
Call it "pay as you go."
Come on, baby.
It's safecracking time.
Lieutenant Hankow
in the Robbery division, please.
Hi, lieutenant, this is Eddie Crouse,
Brentown Loan.
Fine, how are you? There was a man here
just now said his name was Tony Collins...
with two pieces of very large jewelry
and no bill of sale.
Said he wanted to get rid of it fast
to buy a Maserati.
A what?
Oh, one of those.
Yeah, maybe we better.
Give me that name again.
Tony...
Collins.
Address?
Yeah. Yeah.
- Got it.
- Hey, Sid.
All right, thank you, Mr. Crouse.
Sid, what's that about Tony Collins?
Trying to hock some jewelry
with the Brentown outfit.
Crouse turned him down.
Figured it might be hot.
- Do you know anything about him?
- Yeah. I saw him this morning.
- Let me follow this through, will you?
- You got it.
Skorovich, toss me my hat, will you?
- What do these apartments rent for?
- From 4 to 700 dollars a month.
Unfurnished, of course.
- How much does Collins pay?
- $500 a month.
Plus service charges.
- What does Collins do for a living?
- He's a golf pro...
at the Las Floras Country Club.
Must sell a lot of clubs.
We just want to look around.
We won't disturb anything.
Oh, fine, fine.
But I would appreciate if you wouldn't allow
Mr. Collins to find you in his apartment.
Won't be long.
I'll take the bedroom.
Ben.
Take a look.
Golf pro in the jewelry business.
- What did you find?
- You tell me.
I found it in his clothes closet.
Narcotics?
I don't know.
Something for the lab.
- Check the bathroom?
- Yeah. Nothing.
Put it back where you found it.
Okay.
Collins is on his way up. Here. Take this
to the lab and tell them to rush it.
- All right.
- I'll stick around.
Couldn't unload it?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- The manager let me in.
- Then he's in a lot of trouble.
- Could be.
How did you come by that stuff
you're trying to pawn?
Oh, that creep at the loan company.
How did you get it?
A lady gave it to me.
- Services rendered.
- What lady?
- Mrs. Frank DeLorca. Want to ask her?
- Well, that's what I had in mind.
How about the stuff you have stashed
in the golf bag?
May as well ask her about that too.
Whatever you say, sergeant.
He doesn't believe that
you gave me the jewelry.
Will you straighten him out, baby?
Mr. Collins told you
the truth, sergeant.
- If you say so, Mrs. DeLorca.
- And, sergeant...
get off my back. You had no right
to search my apartment...
even if the manager let you in.
So get it off the books, now.
Unless you want to face charges.
Robbery detail.
Let me talk to Ben Hogue.
Ben, the jewelry thing
on Tony Collins...
off the books.
They were a gift from Mrs. DeLorca.
What did it say?
Oh, is that so?
Yes, of course.
I'll ask him.
What do you use
arsenic for, Mr. Collins?
I drink it on the rocks.
Oh, come on, sergeant.
Make sense for a change, will you?
We found a sack full of arsenic
in your closet.
Do you want to explain it
here or downtown?
Well, now, do you want the 50-cent
explanation or the dollar tour?
- Now, you cased my place, right?
- That is right.
- Did you happen to notice a balcony?
- I did.
And on this balcony,
did you see some flower boxes?
Yes.
Weed free. That's what arsenic
is used for, sergeant. Weeds.
Next.
Where did you get it?
At my club. Las Floras Country Club.
They buy it by the truckload.
I borrowed some.
What did your husband die of,
Mrs. DeLorca?
A heart attack.
Arsenic poisoning is often mistaken
for a heart attack.
Good night.
Maggie was as guilty as I.
Now you're Maggie.
The old Mexican standoff, isn't it?
You said something this morning
about going to Europe alone.
We're going together, Edith.
You and Maggie killed Frank.
Dear God!
Any way you slice it, cancels us out.
Take me no time at all to prove that you
aren't Maggie, and you killed your sister.
Sort of being like in the same boat,
except I'm in the driver's seat.
Oh, not by a long, long shot.
You see, Tony, I don't care anymore.
I don't care one damn
about anything anymore.
But you, you care. How you care,
about money, about cars, about living.
You can't hurt me anymore,
not the police, nor you, or anyone else.
Now, get out!
Get out!
Like hell, I'll get out.
You try to make me get out.
- Duke!
- Or you do what I...
Get him off!
Henry!
Henry!
Henry!
Henry!
- You're back again?
- Yeah, I'm back.
- Jim, I've got work to do.
- Only take a minute.
Okay, what's on your mind today?
The thing that happened
at the DeLorca place.
Jim, we went over that yesterday.
A golf pro gets killed by a dog.
It's all wrapped up in the files.
Maybe.
Maybe. Once you told me that maybe a lot
of rich old men who die of heart attacks...
are lying in their graves with arsenic
in their stomachs? Remember?
- What rich old men are you talking about?
- DeLorca.
Pretty rich.
Look, Jim, will you do me a favor?
Do yourself a favor. Forget the DeLorcas.
She reminds you so much of Edie,
you can't see straight.
I'm talking to you as a cop, Jim.
Snap out of it.
I know. My detail is robbery.
All I have to worry about is who gets
the jewelry that they found on Collins.
But there's a lot of arsenic
floating around.
Collins told the greenskeeper at the club
he wanted it for his lawn.
On the 17th floor?
He gets the arsenic
just before DeLorca dies...
then goes to Europe
a day before the funeral.
If you ask me,
that's pretty good timing.
If I were sitting
where you're sitting...
the coroner would be digging
up DeLorca's body right now.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sergeant.
- I have to talk to you about the jewelry.
- I thought we'd been all through that.
No, this is different.
Please forgive me. Yesterday was
such an awful ordeal for me.
The coroner's office is holding the jewelry
until ownership can be established...
because it was found
on Mr. Collins' body.
Oh, I see.
That's an awful lot of jewelry,
Mrs. DeLorca.
And all I have to find out is,
did you give it under duress?
- Was he blackmailing you?
- Blackmailing me? What for?
He was my lover.
Well, then, it goes to his next of kin.
Some fellow in Perth, Australia.
- Well, he's going to get a pleasant surprise.
- Is there anything else, sergeant?
No. No, that's all from my division.
But Homicide came up
with some evidence this morning.
They exhumed your husband's body.
They found arsenic.
Did you...?
Did you ever wake up in the dark feeling...?
Feeling all alone?
Oh, I mean, terribly alone.
No one... No one else on earth,
just the...
the dark all around you and that...
that awful, scary emptiness?
Don't you know me?
Don't you know me, Jim?
I'm not Margaret. I didn't kill
Frank DeLorca. I'm Edie, Jim.
Mrs. DeLorca...
I don't know where you think
this'll get you...
but you couldn't be Edie
in a thousand years.
Why, Edie was the kind of person a guy
is lucky to meet once in his lifetime.
She was an honest to God good person.
Sweet, gentle, kind, and you...
Lady, you don't know
the meaning of those words.
Edie would never murder her sister.
She wouldn't even hurt a fly.
Forget it, sergeant.
It was just a lousy joke.
Edie and I used to try and fool people
all the time when we were kids.
Jim. Mrs. DeLorca, I've got to book you.
The charge is suspicion of murder.
I better change, don't you think?
Why don't you gentlemen
have a drink while I get ready?
- I'm sorry, I'll have to go with you.
- No. No. It's all right.
Are they sure?
Yes, they're sure. Beyond a doubt.
Mr. Harrison called.
I told him you were busy.
Thank you.
At the trial, madam,
what would you have me say?
You've known all along.
Yes, madam.
And you're saying...
you won't tell anybody.
If that is your wish, madam.
And I thought I was all alone.
Thank you, Henry.
- Silence in the court. Silence.
- She told me Collins was her lover.
Mr. Collins didn't pay the rent,
Mrs. DeLorca did.
A very cozy setup, ladies and gentlemen.
Look at her, an admitted adulteress.
Margaret DeLorca is guilty of loving
the wrong man. Nothing else.
She never waited
on Mr. DeLorca personally.
Whiskey and milk.
Madam gave it to him the night he died.
Frank DeLorca had a history
of coronary disease...
symptoms similar to those
of arsenic poisoning.
He said he wanted it for his lawn.
Heart failure induced
by a massive dose of arsenic.
Guesses, opinions, but no proof.
Facts, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Facts and proof beyond
any reasonable doubt.
The defendant will please rise.
Margaret DeLorca, do you
have anything to say...
before sentence shall be
passed upon you?
No, Your Honor.
It is the judgment and sentence of the court
that the defendant, Margaret DeLorca...
found guilty of the crime of murder
in the first degree...
shall suffer the extreme penalty,
to wit, the death penalty.
That said penalty shall be
inflicted within the walls...
of the state penitentiary
at San Quentin, California...
in the manner and means
prescribed by law, to wit...
the administration of lethal gas
until said defendant is dead.
Give me a minute?
The last time I was at your house, you said
something I can't get out of my mind.
You said, "I'm Edie, Jim.
Don't you know me?"
Something like that.
Was that the truth?
I'm Margaret DeLorca, sergeant.
As you said, Edie would
never have hurt a fly.
