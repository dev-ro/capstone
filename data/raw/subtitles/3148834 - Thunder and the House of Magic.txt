The purple one, yes.
Thank you, Twiggoo.
Almost done
There you go.
Good as new.
You quite welcome
And next time, be more careful....
And don't use the restroom
as your playground.
Speaking of appearances.
I remember my first like it was yesterday.
Drum roll, please.
It was the 1954th
My appearance with magic
To great success throughout Europe and Asia
But it was by far and way my most of accompanist trick ever.
Ladies and gentlemen....
Cover your eyes
I and I alone...
A mere mortal
Will be the only thing standing between you
And thousands of flying daggers
Who could that be this hour?
Oh my, an intruder?
Everyone quickly hide!
Let's see,
who wants to breaks into our house.
- Oh come on, Uncle Lawrence.
- Oh, Daniel. It's you.
Not another one of your stupid tricks.
Open the box.
Yes, yes. Sure yeah
I thought you were a burglar.
A burglar? I could not
open your rusty old door thats all
Yeah i know, I need to fix it.
So much to do.
- Just get me out of this constraption.
- That would be a problem....
- As soon as I find the key.
- Are you kidding me?...
- Uncle Larry, I do not have time for this
- Of course, time is money.
Whatever that means.
It's so nice of you to visit.
Would you like some tea,
or maybe some cookies?
Uncle Lawrence.I got a call from the power company
You forget to pay your utality bill.
- Again.
- Here it is.
It was in my pocket all the time.
It's not funny.
Watchut for your hands.
And ...
Your nose.
I'm sick and tired of your stupid tricks
- You used to love them.
- Uncle Lawrence.
We need to talk about this house
What exactly is there to talk about?
- Is there a cat in here?
- A cat? No, I don't believe so
- Why do you ask?
- Look at me.
Maybe you are allergic to something else
Oh did i asked you if you like some cookies?
No cookies. If i stay in here any longer
I will be blowup like a plane
- Sneezy.
- I have allergies to two things
Wasting time...
And cats
You should think about selling this place
I have got clients who would love
to put their hands on a property like this.
- They will pay top doller.
- Why would I do that?
This house has been a family for generations.
I know  you are a great REAL ESTATE AGENT
But if I sold it,where would I go?
How about a nice retired home ?
Retired?? Thats for old people
And besides
Where would I put my belonging things?
I would like to throw all this junk
Junk ? This is not junk
My whole life is in here
Whatever, just....
Pay your bills
He was such a nice kid
What happened?
Don't worry everyone
I am not going to sell my house.
What would I do without all of you around?
This house is enchanted.
Isn't that right, Maggie?
Come up here, Jack.
Where is Edison?
I need to put some oil in his new winding.
Otherwise he will not be available.
I do not know that any of you geting rusty here
And anyone don't work anymore.
That would not go.

But I tell you i never like that nephew of his
He's up to know good i say
Not Good indeed

Lawrence should be home soon.
In the meantime, I'll take care of you
And we all look after the house.
- He looks pretty bad
- Voice down
Mr. Lawrence?
Mr. Lawrence?
- It's Izzy and Dylan.
- We heard you had an accident
We should let him rest
What was That?
- Look it's the magic trank!
- Be quiet.
- Let's open it.
- Not sure thats a good idea.
Okey...condo condo. This is our chance.
You must warn the others of the house
- Now we are in trouble
- I told you.
- Maybe they fly home.
- Let's hope so.
Where are the others?
Where's the cat?
- What are you doing here?
- Nurse Baxter.
It is forbidden to pry
in mr. Lawrence cases.
- We just wanted to ...
- Animals!
Izzy.
What animals? My goodness, a mouse.
These animals have nothing to do here.
They must get out of here.
You can not throw them out.
It should not mind.
Back in the rooms.
I told you.
Sorry!
- Carlo. Carla.
- Look, it's kitten.
- We did not think you did it.
- Where's Lawrence?
He is in the hospital.
He was badly injured.
- Jack is injured.
- But that's not the worst.
He says that his nephew would take care of us.
- But not in a good way.
- We have to defend ourselves.
We need to find out what he is up to.
It's true.
We must be vigilant
and be ready for anything.
Carlo, Carla, keep watch.
Edison, Twiggoo, follow me.
- The trunk must be removed.
- Could not wait for tonight.
- No, unfortunately.
- Out with it, he will not need it.
-It includes animal and they are not allowed here.
-Fine
I'll take care of it.
- Daniel?
- You have to sign this.
It allows me to control your
business while you are here.
- Do you think your electricity bill?
- Not exactly the bill ...
No matter. Just sign here.
It's sweet of you,
to pay my bills.
Do you want to feed my animals,
and watering my plants?
-Trust me, I'll take care of it all.
-Jack
Have not you forgotten something?
- He's here.
- What? Who?
He's coffin.
The casket looks heavy out, Daniel..
- Someone should help you.
- Actually ...
- Your tuxedo.
- Yes, of course.
- I did not intend ...
- It does not track.
Well I could reach it, at such short notice.
In the first, I show it to.
You look amazing tonight, Audrey.
- Your charmer.
- How is the real estate market?
Incredibly busy....
Who said crisis?
There remains to be done a little.
Yes, but the design is good.
- They talk about fixing the house.
- Sounds good.
Perhaps his nephew not so bad..
Daniel wants to sell the house,
without Lawrence knows about it.
And we will be evicted.
- Are you sure?
- It happened to me.
What can we do?
- What is it?
- I have an idea.
I guess that the house is hard
keep, for an old man.
Caution. We are
way to the charity party.
Shall we go in?
Disgusting!
Daniel. Stop those nasty ...
I'm really sorry.
I regret ....
Come on....
Should we find another time?
Remove our number.
Damn birds.
I'm sure there's a cat in here.
- Jack, Maggie. Are you okay?
- What do you think?
- Get us out of here.
- We are.
- Is it him, I think it is?
- I thought we got rid of him.
Put all together.
Roll it around.
- You!
- Hello, Jack.
It is not enough to make us
forget what you did to Lawrence.
It would not have happened if you had not
stabbed me, you were there, tell them.
We did not really matter.
He has messed it all.
The old is furious.
That's an understatement.
He is ready to kill you.
I do not believe you if Lawrence
do not want me here, I wil leave.
The truth is that we may lose the house.
All that matters to us.
And it's your fault.
Wait! You need me to save the house.
His nephew is allergic to cats, right?
You are all in safety,
as long as I'm here..
The cat is right.
Will it never end?
Edison?
Can you get me out of here?
Sorry, everything went wrong because of me.
I should have listened to Lawrence.
Daniel will sell the house.
Jack is right when Lawrence comes
back, he kicks me out.
I end up on the street again..
<I> You do not
worry more, my young friend. </ i>
<I> We keep each other company. </ I>
You're right, Edison.
He was so lenient when he took to heart.
He said I was a part of the family.
We do not throw his family out
Do you?
I am not sure it is a
good idea to have a cat in the house.
We should get rid of him.
Once and for all
Daniel can not stand cat hair
He may be our best defense.
- He is not alone.
- We're counting on you.
- Not again.
- Also make sure to hit him.
- Mrs. Johnson?
- La-Sondra La-Sondra Johnson.
It's a pleasure. What a lovely dog ??
you have here
What's wrong with you, honey?
Relax, mom is here.
Shall we?
Do you live in the neighborhood?
I need a bigger place,
so I can open a hair salon.
You can make a fortune
by making rasta braids.
- You better give me some room.
- Sorry, smaller birds problem.
Lack of fiber, I suppose.
Forget it.
Please.
He must have seen us.
What do we do now?
- We go to plan B.
- Plan B?
Maybe a little rodent problem
affect the buyer?
- I like Plan B.
- I'm with.
I will not let you, Jack.
- I'm here a little problem.
- A problem?
You must tell me about
all errors, I know my ...
The owner had a cat,
and I'm allergic.
I do not smell anything.
Take your time.
Take a good look.

I am right here
If you Have some question
The damn cat
must still be there.
The man has a screw loose.
This place makes me afraid.
I will not fight the beast.
What's with you today?
Stay here. Mother's gonna be right back.
It is a grand staircase.
Nothing panic.
There must be an open window.
Pull yourself together.
Remember breathing.
I wonder where the cat is?
Enough become a ghost.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Dogs!
- Who's there?
- Up here. There's me, Thunder. The cat.
Are you the one I knew
this place was crazy.
- They have made you a bird.
- No, they locked me inside.
What's wrong?
No more family happiness?
Well,It's complicated.
There is sure a dog cemetery Or spooky ghosts.
- Why would my own buy this?
- We have to stop her.
- That's what I say.
- You have to help me out.
No problem.
How do I do it?
Take my tail.
I knew it.
Are you sure?
What if I tear it off?
I doubt that, come on, grab it.
There is whole lots of steps.
Oh..My little darling.
- Thank you.
- Can we get out of here?
Follow me.
I got you, stupid cat.
Now ends the game.
Goodbye, allergies.
What have you done to my dog?
At least the stupid cat away.
Well done, Maggie.
- Ha ?
You scared her.
We got rid of her.
Yes, of course.
What about the cat?
Fur Klumpen used known your
diversion to escape.
It does not matter.
We'll be fine without him.
Now we have a super rodent in the house.
Look, there's a cat outside..
How did it get there?
These grapes are a delight.
In spoil me.
- Where did you find them?
- Look, there's a cat?
It's thunder.
You little rascal.
What are you waiting for.
Come here.
Sudah berapa lama kau memeliharanya ?
- How long have you had him?
- He showed up at my house......
I do not think he's a wildcat. He
er ren og opdraget. Men intet navneskilt.
- Måske er han faret vild.
- Nok nærmere forladt.
Mengerikan, untuk kucing kecil secantik ini.
Sekarang masa-masa yang sulit.
Banyak orang yang kehilangan rumah mereka .
Tidak bisa menjaga hewan piaraan mereka.
Come on, Thunder.
- What is it?
- He's afraid of you.
Perhaps he thought I was mad at him
for what has happened.
No, it's not your fault.
- Can we keep it?
- I'd love to, but ...
- You know the nurse Bakster.
- Yes you're right, he's an evil nurse.
No, not really. Firmly as possible,
But not evil.
Besides these hospitals,
Maybe you should go home.
Accompany the others, I'm Daniel
to keep you all.
Do not worry.
I'll be home soon.
Ah, there you are you two.
- What are you hiding?
- None.
Move over.
Strange. You should not interfere
Mr. Lawrence.
Not at all, I'm glad they
accompany, we want to play cards.
Eight. Nine. Ten. Nice.
And pumps.
Be careful with your head, soldier?
I'm a tiger, I'm a predator,
my fatal bite.
Perfect.
You're ready for our next guests.
Huge potential.
I could tear down this wall.
making it a beautiful open space here.
And suitable for such ...
- Boutique Hotel.
- Incredible. So you like it?
Really?
I was so scared ..
Let me call my wife,
He should be here now.
He must be crazy about this house..
I'm sure he had come.
Should you continue reviewing
I'll say hello to your wife.
The stairs are very beautiful.
Very Gothic.
It would be great with a white wash effect
and gold accents.
There is no mercy.
What's this?
Rats kung fu?
Ridiculous.
Honey.
- It seems someone in trouble?
- Everything is under control.
- If you say so.
- <I> The owner wanted to sell </ i>.
No, wait.
Get me out of here.
What is included with the furniture?
I'm sure it will be able to convince the owner to ...
to sell part of the collection
perabaotannya.
I think this house, what was his name ..
like uncut diamonds.
- Exactly.
- I'm sure I could do something here.
- I told you.
- It looks like the situation is getting serius.Ayo.
Here is the living room, Ny.Eams.
I'm sure you'll like it.
Full of charm of the old days.
Well, functioning fireplace and ...
- Sorry, allergic to cats.
- I do not see a cat here.
He was gone.
But there are feathers everywhere.
I'm going to get some fresh air first.
If you do not mind.
I will be at the front door,
if you were there first ...
Question?
I forgot to tell you that
wine cellar next to it.
Now you begin to understand me.
It may have a certain charm.
Of course it should be changed.
I love this old driving machine.
Already too old, maybe.
Pipe seems to be no problem.
A typical domestic brands
Oh..it's weird..
I can not ... I can not, oh ..
Whoever did this will regret.
Please. Help me. Honey..
My dear, I find
Château Margaux 1939.
A fun place once.

Unfortunately, but it is
Chateau Margaux 1939.
Now!
Quite amazing.
- What happened?
- You tell me?
- But I do not understand.
- This house is haunted.
Haunted? It was ridiculous.
- Are you saying my wife a liar?
- No, of course..
I'm just saying, there must be
logical explanation.
Enough. I know what I saw.
This happens in this haunted place.
I'm very, very frightened.
This is certainly haunted house.
Yes, you heard what I said:
HAUNTED!
No, what happened here?
Maybe my uncle konyal equipment
getting out of hand again.
I think this house is full of traps.
It's time to get rid of all this junk.
Allergy damn.
Did you see it? Thunder managed
Daniel and his cast as well.
It was a great plan.
He was a genius..
- It's just a good team.
- Wait a minute.
What is going on here? first you escaped and now you appear as by you that own this place.
- I went to the hospital to see Lawrance.
- Liar.
Calm down, Maggie. So, did you meet
with the old man huh?
So tell us,
where the injured leg
See, you never get there.
His left foot bandaged
and his right hand as well.
- Thunder correct.
- And certainly I know that
- He was not mad at me.
- You know what's going to happen?
Catch him.
I say, catch the cat.
So it would be like this?
you will regret it.
Come on, we need to unite.
Daniel was furious.
We must menjangkakan the worst.
I have a new strategy.
And that plan involves
you two as well.
- Not possible.
- You all did a loser.
Come on guys, we show
those who the losers.
Oh no. Not again?
I hope to be home soon.

That definitely is not the place for me.
Then I slapped him a little
and was end to disikusinya.
That's what I call the
solve the problem.
So this is actually what place?
A sort of museum or something?
Actually, the place is filled with
belonged to an old magician junkyard.
We have to clean up everything.
And be careful most of the goods
There are very fragile.
That place in the dustbin.
Who are they? It seems they
here is not to buy a house.
Not important. When Daniel returned,
we will act.
Come on, we clean the house,
and lest one sleep.
The sooner we finish
the sooner we get paid.
