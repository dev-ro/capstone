GUILTY OF ROMANCE
People come to Love Hotels for sex.
Many Love Hotels are
in the Love Hotel district.
In the 90s hookers worked the streets
of Maruyama-cho Love Hotel district.
A mystery took place there
on the eve of the 21st Century.
35 Maruyama-cho,
Shibuya - the Love Hotel district
Let her through.
Detective. This way!
Detective Yoshida!
This way.
In here.
Flashlight.
Detective.
Those are dummy's arms.
But from the waist up,
it's human.
A little higher.
It's a dummy's head.
There's another one.
It's out the back.
From the waste down it's human.
Legs are cut off.
- Is this some kind of paint?
- I think so.
- How about that?
- Blood...I guess.
It says, "Castle."
Maybe it's the name of the victim.
Izumi Kikuchi
- I'm back.
- Welcome home.
Perfectly positioned.
Thank you.
You really are improving.
Thank you.
"That was when she noticed.
"His eyes were like her own.
"And his desire was obvious.
"Kazumi casually approached him
"and threw herself on him
without a word.
"The man only hesitated a moment.
"He slid his hands around her back
"and embraced her passionately.
"As if to say,
'Strike while the iron is hot.'
"He urgently sought her lips
with his own."
Meet the Author of
The Midnight Zoo
- I love your work.
- Oh, you're so kind.
- Here. Thank you for coming.
- Can I shake your hand?
Are you leaving?
Yes. I don't want to get in the way.
Thank you for everything.
- Off I go then.
- Have a nice day.
Come in.
My goodness! This is so classy.
So this is what it means
to marry well.
I love boasting that my friend
married Yukio Kikuchi.
Sorry, I got carried away
in my excitement.
- It's fine.
- Can I see his workroom?
Yeah, me too!
Can we, Izumi?
It's not here.
His office is elsewhere.
- What?
- He leaves here at 7.00 every morning.
And he comes home at exactly 9.00pm.
- So he doesn't write here?
- No, he said he needs to concentrate.
So he's not home during the day?
He's as punctual as a school student.
- What about meals?
- I usually eat alone.
I want to do something.
Before I turn 30.
That 3 all I think about.
I desperately want to do something.
Anything will do.
I want to suppress this urge.
I disgust myself
Loving my husband should be enough.
Good idea, Izumi.
Really?
I was worried that you had
nothing to do during the day.
I'm all for it. This is not
Ibsen's Doll's House, after all.
I'm happy for you.
Hi! Would you like to try
a delicious sausage?
Care for some?
Delicious sausages.
How about some sausages?
- Very delicious sausages.
- Speak louder.
- The customers won't hear you.
- Yes, sir.
Your husband is a famous novelist?
I heard a rumour.
- I won't treat you special.
- I'm sorry.
Ma'am, how about
some delicious sausages?
When my insomnia finally ends,
I'll stop this journal
I want to stop.
- I'm off, then.
- Have a nice day.
Sample a sausage.
How about some
delicious sausages?
Ma'am, how about some sausages?
- I'll have one.
- Please do.
Very nice.
I'm talking about you!
You're nice.
Why's a pretty girl like you
working here?
How about modelling?
When's your lunch break?
I'll tell you more.
Miss ERI TSUCHIYA
This is legitimate.
You can work your own hours
and get paid on the spot.
Go ahead.
Everybody's so pretty.
Some of these girls are nude...
Do I have to be nude?
It's about feminine beauty.
And you have what it takes.
Drop by at the studio.
I'll call you.
- Izumi.
- Yes!
Hey, Izumi!
- Yes?
- Come here.
This isn't my usual soap.
Where's the little one?
Sorry, I didn't realise
we'd run out...
No excuses.
You know that
I don't favour Japanese soap.
I'm sorry.
What's the best soap?
It's Savon de Marseille
from France.
So you knew that.
Why don't you keep
a supply of it?
I'm so sorry.
Hold it.
Stand there.
Let me show you my body.
Yes.
You haven't seen my body recently,
have you?
Yes.
Am I less fit than I used to be?
No...
No? Elaborate.
I'd love you
whatever shape you're in.
Good. That's why I love you.
You can touch my penis if you like.
- May I?
- Yes.
- How about that?
- I'm happy.
Good.
- Off I go, then.
- Have a nice day.
CALL ME, ERI TSUCHIYA.
Hello?
I know it's sudden
but do you have time tomorrow?
Tomorrow...?
Like they say.
'Strike while the iron is hot. "
There is no time to waste.
We're out of time!
You're here!
ËýÀ´ÁË
- She's here.
- Welcome!
Come on in.
Was it easy to find?
Izumi Kikuchi!
Hey, Izumi!
Come on.
Do you like the studio?
I just couldn't resist
talking to her.
- There he is.
- Hi, I'm Martini Maki.
Welcome.
Just call him Martini.
- Hold her bag please.
- May I?
Sit here.
Gorgeous. Such a small face.
How about the Chinese dress?
In that case, I'll do it like this.
That's one option.
The red dress?
You'd look good in red!
You should try it!
You like red? Red, it is!
Where's my palette?
Okay, let's do it. We're set!
- How is she?
- She's ready.
Let's begin.
We're ready. Come this way.
Relax. Your shoulders are tense.
She's all yours.
He's the director.
Here we go now.
Ready.
Let's try a pose.
Put your hand on your hip.
Very good!
Great expression!
Adorable!
Give me cat paws.
Sensational!
Nice.
Go on.
That's good, I love it!
Take your hand away,
don't be shy.
Very good.
Here she is.
- It's like fine art.
- Beautiful.
So gorgeous
I can't take my eyes off you.
She's the best.
Don't worry, open up a little.
You're so beautiful, it's okay.
- Beautiful!
- I love that.
Now, then...
Let's try some nude, shall we?
You're so beautiful,
it'll be great.
But...
Why not?
It's just a little making out.
- It won't take long.
- Hi, there!
So you're married?
What a cutie!
Don't worry, we'll just pretend.
It's not for real.
Open your mouth.
For a kiss.
Don't worry.
That was nice.
Here! it's 50,000 yen,
10 times your daily wage.
Piece of cake, right?
You can go to the 3rd floor
and take a bath.
- Okay.
- Good work.
I'll look after her.
Hard day?
Are you free from now?
It was great with you,
but I'm unsatisfied
because it was just acting.
How about you?
How about a love hotel?
Let's go, shall we?
Hello, there.
Would you care for some?
Hello, there.
How about you?
Care for some?
Want some?
It's delicious.
Hello, there.
Would you like to try some?
It's very delicious.
Hello, there.
Would you like to have some?
It's very good.
Hello, there.
Would you care for some?
It's delicious.
You can try some.
Hello, there.
Would you like some?
It's delicious.
Try some.
Hello, there.
Would you care for some?
It's very delicious.
Try some.
Hello, there.
Would you care for some?
It's delicious.
Try some.
Hello!
Try this, it's very delicious.
How about you,
would you like some?
Hello, care for some?
It's delicious. Try some.
Hello.
Try this, it's delicious.
Hi, try this.
It's very delicious.
Hello, there!
Hi, would you care
for some delicious sausages?
Care to sample this?
Thank you, sir!
Hello, there!
Try a delicious sausage.
- You sound great today.
- Thank you.
You look radiant too.
It's very good.
You're so sexy,
you'll draw more customers.
Since you've been going out...
You look relaxed.
You look really good, Izumi.
- Off I go, then.
- Have a nice day.
That's fantastic.
Very nice, you're so beautiful.
Yes, that's good.
You're amazing today.
Fantastic!
I'm going to pump you
to the max!
Go for it, Martini!
Hello, care for a sausage?
Give it a try.
- Can I?
- Go ahead.
- It's good!
- Have some more.
Really?
You can have me too.
"The man's love had aroused
her senses,
"making her primitive and wild.
"And Takahiko couldn't tolerate it.
"He was jealous to be precise.
"Not of the man.
"He was jealous of Harue,
who was now set free."
You know...
tomorrow's my birthday.
And you'll be...?
30.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
- You still live with your parents?
- Don't say that!
- Off I go, then.
- Have a nice day.
Hey.
Did I surprise you?
Meeting someone?
I'm just killing time.
- Come with me then.
- No time for that.
- It won't take long.
- Sorry.
Maruyama-cho, Shibuya
3,300 YEN FOR 2 HRS
VACANCIES
Hey, wait!
Wait a minute!
Look. They're all looking
for the Castle.
They want to find it,
but they can't.
So they go round and round,
looking for it.
Sorry, I followed you.
Look what I've done.
We can go to a hotel and clean up.
I'm married.
- So what? Let's go to the Castle.
- What's that?
I don't know
but a woman told me about it.
"Nobody's found the way
to the Castle yet."
But I know the way
to our Castle.
THE CASTLE
Officers.
This building will be demolished.
It wasn't locked
so access was easy.
A young couple found the bodies.
They were walking by,
and on a dare they went in
and found the body.
There were used condoms everywhere.
Identifying the offender will be hard
from the DNA samples.
CASTLE
Say you're a whore!
Please, don't...
Say you're a whore! Come on!
- I'm a whore!
- Again!
I'm a whore!
Say you're a dirty whore!
I'm a dirty whore!
Good.
What's this...? Hey!
Stop it! Don't do that!
Let go of me!
Stop it, let me go!
I booked this room for 2 hours,
but I'm keeping it
until the morning.
What do you want?
Call your husband and tell him
you won't be home tonight.
What are you doing?
Stop! Give it back!
- Call him.
- Let go!
- Please!
- Is this your husband's number?
Please don't.
Hello, Izumi?
Hello?
Hello?
Honey?
Ye. what is it?
I'll be late tonight.
What's wrong?
I'll tell you later.
Later.
Wrong. Tell him now.
Or else I'll tell him.
I'll tell him where we are.
- Come on.
- Are you there?
- Izumi?
- Honey...
I don't think
I can come home tonight.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
What is going on...?
Well done.
You said you didn't give a shit
about your hubby.
So don't cry.
Do you want it?
Do you want your phone back?
Will you forgive me?
- Sure I will. You want to go home?
- Yes, I do!
- You want to be free?
- Yes.
- And go home?
- Yes!
All right then. Call him back and say,
you're in Shibuya and felt dizzy.
But you're OK now
so you're coming home.
Tell him a story.
- Hello? Izumi?
- Honey?
What's wrong? Are you OK(?
Sorry, honey but I...
What happened?
I just felt dizzy.
Dizzy?
I almost fainted...
- I wanted to go to the hospital.
- Are you really OK(?
Now I'm feeling better.
Are you sure? Where are you?
Izumi?
- Hello?
- I'll be back soon.
I'm coming soon.
Where are you now?
Hang up the phone.
Hang it up.
I'm cumming!
You did well!
You passed the test. You can go.
You can go home.
Are you OK? We cleaned
your clothes. He'll never know.
Hey, mister.
Want to have a sex for 5,000 yen?
It's me, silly!
You're hustling in the street?
Shit! How low can you get?
Remember I told you
about the Castle?
She told me about it.
She's strange.
She told me that we'd roam
around the Castle forever
and never find the way in.
Tell her your name.
The Castle?
No, your name!
Come with me.
Mitsuko Ozawa
She was reported missing
yesterday.
If she's the one, it's been 11 days
since the murder...
Doesn't anyone notice
when lecturers disappear?
That's nice.
She was reported missing
by her classy mother.
She works at an elite university.
She wouldn't be involved
in a case like this.
But the neighbours saw her
coming home late,
dressed in trashy clothes.
She commutes from home.
The murder site is nowhere
near her work or house.
Is she an escort?
A call girl? No way!
She's an associate professor.
Her life is good!
Mitsuko Ozawa, 39.
Associate Professor,
Department of Literature.
Her father was also
a Toto University professor.
In the same department.
His hobby was painting.
The daughter often modelled for him.
Her father was Shinsuke Ozawa.
He's been dead for 10 years.
Now she lives with her mother
in their mansion.
Her life seemed staid
when I checked her out.
- Stop following me.
- But...
You can go home.
Forget about that man. Go home.
Wait!
Listen.
While people think you have
a dark side, you're still OK.
But soon the darkness falls.
It's very dark around here.
You'd better stay away.
Go home now.
Is it Kafka's Castle?
You know Kafka! I'm impressed.
I read a lot.
You want to be a writer?
I'm married to one.
- Who is he?
- Do you know Yukio Kikuchi?
Love Shines on the World?
He is a very pure man.
So pure I can't keep up with him.
My father was a very pure man too.
But a pure man's Castle
isn't the way in.
The way in and out of love
is elsewhere.
How funny!
That's right,
in the beginning it was Kafka.
Father gave me a book.
It wasn't a Kafka.
It was my father who told me
about the Castle.
I don't know...
I don't know what to do now!
I think I'm going crazy...
You have to tell me
what I'm supposed to do.
Please.
When I saw your face,
I knew you would be able
to guide me.
I'm a street hooker!
You know what that is?
Yes!
And I understand how you feel.
What?
How about sex with me for 5,000 yen?
- Seriously?
- Fuck me.
- Yes.
- Fuck me, come on.
We're not dealing with two bodies.
It's one. One single victim.
The body was decapitated.
Both arms were severed.
The clitoris and labia majora
were removed.
Dismembered
at the waist and knees.
These two parts belonged
to one person.
Semen found in the vagina
has deteriorated over 10 days.
The tails have separated
but the heads are intact.
Most sperm heads disintegrate
in about 20 days.
Given what we have,
I conclude that it's a woman.
Aged from late 205 to late 305.
The head and limbs were
removed post-mortem.
On My Way Home.
A poem by Ryuichi Tamura.
I should never have learned word
0 for a world without words
Living in a world
where meanings don't matter
If beautiful words
take revenge against you
It 3 none of my concern
If quiet meanings make you bleed
It also is none of my concern
The tears in your gentle eyes
The pain that drips
from your silent tongue
I'd simply gaze at them
and walk away
If our world had no words
In your tears
Is there as much meaning
as in the core of a fruit?
In a drop of your blood
Is there a shimmering resonance
of the evening glow
of this world 3 sunset?
I should never have learned words
Simply because I know Japanese
and bits of a foreign tongue
I stand still inside your tears
I come back alone
In to your blood
You've come, Izumi.
Oh, Mitsuko.
Hello...
Take it.
Okay...
- What's your name?
- My name is Izumi Kikuchi.
Mine's Mitsuko Ozawa.
Nice to know you, Izumi.
Nice to meet you.
After each session,
I roll up the carpet.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Sit down.
Let's drink to sex!
- Izumi.
- Yes?
You want to work for Kaoru?
Don't you know him?
The guy you were with.
I just had sex with him.
- For free?
- Yes.
Make him pay if there's no love!
Visit me if you like.
At Toto University.
THE LECTURE HALL AT 4.00PM
Such nice weather.
My father used to sit here like this.
And he told me many stories.
- I...
- You don't have to tell me anything yet.
I know you. I understand you.
Because YOU BYE me.
So I want you to know me better.
Because you have
to know yourself better.
So you can protect yourself.
You don't know anything
about yourself.
I guess not.
That's why you can't control yourself.
But words aren't going
to help you understand.
It's like my lectures,
they're superficial.
But I thought you were fantastic.
Me?
Yes, the way you delivered
the lecture...
Tell me what you learned.
See?
People say that
this is an elite university.
But the students only understand
half of what I say.
Lectures are just words, after all.
Real words have substance,
each one of them.
They have body.
Put out your tongue.
Don't be shy.
This is a tongue.
It's wet with your saliva.
See, it's sticky.
A tongue. Saliva. Sticky.
See? Every word has flesh.
Like those breasts of yours.
Your thighs.
Every word has a meaning.
Do you know what I mean?
It's about body.
The word's meaning is its body.
Don't worry.
I'm sorry...
Do you remember my lecture?
I recited a Japanese poem.
I should never have learned words
Simply because I know Japanese
and bits of a foreign tongue
I stand still
Inside your tears
Don't worry about him.
He knows my secret.
What?
I gave him a student discount.
But don't worry.
When you have a secret, you're
careful with the secrets of others'.
Follow me, Izumi.
- Yes, ma'am?
- You want to do it?
- I don't have much cash.
- How much?
About 4,000 yen.
3,000 yen will do.
- You want to do him?
- Eh?
Come with us.
Let's toast.
Cheers!
Cheers.
It's on me,
earned with my body, Izumi.
Let me show you
what I become at night.
Where's Shinsuke?
Where has he gone?
He's dead.
What?
Is he dead?
Not much I can do about it.
Shinsuke...
Where has he gone?
Shinsuke's dead.
Really?
Well, that's that.
Okay. Let's go.
- Izumi.
- Yes.
Stay back,
otherwise men can't approach me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
When I hook up,
I'll go to the empty apartments.
Come to apartment 101.
Watch us quietly.
It won't take long.
- Is that her?
- She's old...!
Trust me. She's incredible.
Here I am again.
Hey, what do you think of her?
You can fuck my apprentice
for the same price!
- OK.
- No!
- I'll have her!
- Stop it!
Let go of me!
- Accept him!
- Open up!
Accept him, Izumi!
Here.
This is not enough.
You had the two of us.
- You fucked her too.
- Give us a discount.
Bullshit!
You're cheap
for a company executive!
What did you say, you whore?
- What did you call me?
- What?
Pay me now!
Take it.
Pick the money up.
Now!
You missed one.
All this! You earned all of it
with your body!
Be responsible!
Now the word "Izumi Kikuchi"
has conceived a meaning!
- Don't cry!
- Sorry.
You...
Make sure you fall all the way.
Down to my depth!
- Understand?
- Yes.
The night's young.
We have time.
Let's go get our next customer.
I'm sorry, but I can't do it.
- Do what?
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry...
- Stop crying.
- I'm sorry.
That's enough!
This 5,000 yen...
...has value.
You feel guilty for cheating
on your husband.
Every night, you tell yourself
that you only love your husband.
Have sex with men
and make them pay for it.
Nothing's free.
They had a good time.
It doesn't matter
how much they pay.
It's the vain delusion
of a rotten whore
to measure her value
in terms of what a man pays her.
When you fuck a man
you don't love,
-it has to be for money.
- Yes.
The 5000 yen
became symbolic for me.
With a little courage
I could throw myself at him,
as he walked in the door:
- Hi, honey.
- I'm home.
Izumi, you look pale.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
- I feel fine.
I love you.
I was unable to respond
Something has changed.
and I feel it.
Words are invalid, meaningless.
I was just desperate.
I had an insatiable craving
for my husband
But once again,
I didn't do it tonight.
We slept peacefully together
as usual
- Off I go.
- Have a nice day.
In the morning; I saw him off
As usual I hoped to send him off
with a deep kiss.
- Off I go.
- Have a nice day.
- Off I go.
- Have a nice day.
But it was all in my head
Hi, there!
Have some delicious sausages!
Try some!
I have delicious sausages!
Hi.
- How's it going?
- I'm fine.
You know...
- I want to eat later.
- Really? For how much?
I'm not talking
about the sausages.
I know that.
Nothing's for free.
You have to pay me.
- What do you mean?
- You have to buy me.
You're weird.
Try some big sausages!
Hello. it's me.
Can we talk no W?
- Can you do a job for us?
- Yes!
- Thank you for today!
- Likewise...
- Hey.
- What a day!
You were amazing back there.
If you have some spare time,
why don't we go to a hotel
like before...
- For how much?
- What?
How much will you pay me?
But this isn't that kind of a deal...
What is it then?
I just did it for money.
So if I do it again,
I'll have to be paid.
Why should I pay you?
You should pay me for my body!
Oh, I see. You came after me
to offer yourself for free?
That's right!
If I were a man,
I'd pay a desirable woman for sex.
See you!
Just like Mitsuko said.
When you have sex for money,
everything suddenly
comes into focus.
- Waiting for somebody?
- No.
- Come with me then.
- For sex?
You want sex?
OK, let's go.
You waste no time!
Let's go then.
- How much you got?
- Money?
You're a hooker! That's lame.
Men come to me for sex.
Strangely enough,
men value women who fuck for free.
They look down on women
who ask for money
- Are you a hooker?
- Yes!
- You're hyper.
- Yes!
- How much?
- You name the price. I'll be yours.
- How about 10,000 yen?
- Certainly.
Lucky me!
This is the last entry
of m y journal
It 3 now complete.
I've been set free.
- How have you been?
- I knew you'd come.
You look good.
Things must be going well.
Thanks.
Walk with me.
I texted somebody just a while ago.
It's somebody you met once.
Who is it?
You'll see.
It's been a while.
I work for him every Monday,
Thursday and Friday.
And I thought you should work
for him too.
If you agreed to work for me,
I'd be so happy.
Come to my place for tea.
Come in.
I'm home!
Hello, dear.
That's my mother.
I'm not dressed appropriately...
Never mind that.
Mother knows all about me.
How's the sex trade going?
- It's rather good, thank you.
- I see.
Now that this young lady's agreed
to work for us, I'm very happy.
Oh, is that right?
Have you worked
as a prostitute before?
- Pardon me?
- She has a lot to learn.
Oh. You're still
well-mannered and refined,
but you'll lose that
and become shameless.
My daughter here
was born indecent.
She's just like her sleazy father.
She's right.
Father and I were alike.
My side of the family
is well-bred and cultured.
I never should have married her
sleazy father.
I was young and naive.
Of course, my parents objected.
They insisted that her father
wasn't in our class.
I rebelled, but later I learned
they were right.
We married after my family
adopted him.
But he never quite adapted
to my family's ways.
He and Mitsuko found solace
in each other.
This girl's imperfections
were inherent.
She picked them up from her father.
They are both sleazy fools.
His abominable character
runs in her blood.
Fortunately, the man died
10 years ago.
She was so sad when he died.
She cried and cried.
She's pulled herself together now.
Since she became a prostitute.
She's a degenerate.
Now that she's depraved,
she can relax.
You'd better watch out.
You're not a degenerate yet.
You must have been so confused
to associate with this filthy creature.
I hope you realise this soon.
Hurry up and die, you old hag.
Why don't you die instead, dear?
Maybe I can kill you both!
Just kidding. isn't this funny?
They're hilarious.
Kill us both if you will.
Do us a favour and stop
our cursed lineage with her.
Then this family will be spared
from further disgrace.
Enchantress Club
Enchantress Club! Hello, sir!
You enjoyed our girl?
It's an honour to have served you!
Come in.
- Good evening.
- Hello, I'm Okubo.
She's Yoko. Is that OK?
Yoko, is it? I see.
The work's easy.
You wait for a call.
A patron will call
and give his preferences.
Slim, plump, whatever he's into.
Then I'll pick the appropriate girl.
I'll call out and you'll say...
Here!
That's all.
Then you go to the address.
You're paid up front.
If the patron says "Change,"
you're not his type.
Come right back here.
No scenes.
We have a reputation.
- Well, one of us does.
- Yeah, one of us does.
If he likes you,
get the cash and it's business.
When you're done, come back.
I'll take 20% of your takings.
Easy, right?
Hello, Enchantress Club.
- I'm home!
- Hey.
- I have to go, it's late.
- Okay.
- She's Yoko, a new girl.
- Welcome aboard.
You can have this.
It doesn't suit me.
It's good on you.
And the sunglasses you left
at the hotel the other day.
Sit down.
Mitsuko, what should I do?
Just relax.
- We're leaving now.
- See you.
Don't worry.
You'll be popular for sure.
Yoko.
Such a nice name.
Enchantress Club.
Oh, yes, sir!
- Mitsuko, you're up.
- Bye.
She'll be there in 5 minutes.
- See you later!
- Bye.
There goes the weirdo!
It's a new patron.
So I sent Mitsuko to trick him.
He'll want another girl
so I'd like you to go.
What?
We send low-grade girls
to new clients.
Then he'll go for the VIP Course.
The VIP Course!
He'll have to pay 30,000 yen more,
but he's convinced
that it's a better deal.
A sure deal.
That's what I keep Mitsuko for.
She's strange.
She'll start eating on the bed!
Men like pretty, normal girls like you.
- You're smart.
- That's right!
Get ready, Yoko.
You'll look good in red.
Yes, red it is!
Just like I told you.
Ding-dong.
Sex! Let's do it.
Why are you here?
You're my regular
at the rundown apartment!
I want you changed.
I said change!
Just like I told you.
See? Everything is right here.
This is it!
Enchantress Club! Yes?
You asked for a slim beauty,
didn't you?
Oh, so she's not your type?
How about one of our VIP girls?
- Satisfaction guaranteed...
- Let's go.
Guaranteed by the Enchantress Club.
Go home.
- Let's have sex!
- Stop it!
You know I'm really good.
You know I am! I'm good!
I'm from Enchantress Club.
Sorry about the inconvenience.
Mitsuko, get up.
We did it already.
This drunk woman raped me.
I won't leave until you pay me.
Get off me, you cunt. Get off me!
Get your dirty hands off me!
You whore.
Get up.
She's just started with us today.
We won't charge you for her.
I'll sit right here
and watch Yoko have sex.
- Mitsuko...
- Go ahead!
They're funny.
- Whatever.
- Enjoy.
You're horny, aren't you?
You are horny. Here you are...
How's this?
You like this, huh? Is this good?
I'm asking you!
You nympho!
I know you love it.
Bitch!
You bitch!
- Do you know who I am?
- Shake your ass!
- You know who I am?
- Who cares!
How's this bitch taste?
Izumi...?
Mitsuko, watch.
I'm fucking my own husband now.
Izumi, why...?
Izumi, stop...
Didn't I tell you?
If you fuck a man you don't love,
make him pay!
- Will you ask him for money?
- Yes, I will.
- With that, love ends.
- Yes! I will!
Izumi!
What are you doing here?
Pay me!
Hand over the money.
Izumi.
The money!
The money!
What are you waiting for?
Get out of here.
Out!
Let's go.
It was exciting.
How did you like it?
Come on, tell me.
- Hey!
- What?
How many times
did you fuck him?
Many, many, many times.
- Was he good?
- What? I'm not in love with him.
That asshole.
He's my husband!
You! it's too late to start making a fuss!
How many times
did you fuck my husband?
This is funny.
What would make you happy?
100 times?
Maybe I'll fuck him once more.
Great, I love this.
Open the door! Open up!
Can we fuck once more?
Let's have sex again!
- I'm calling the police!
- Your wife's here!
She's a prostitute!
There goes your reputation!
What do you want now?
Watch this.
I'll show you what he likes.
Oh...that's good.
You think you can write
another good novel?
Yes, I think I can...l can...
He'll write again.
It's always like this.
I strangle him when I fuck him,
and he says
he'll write a good novel.
So...you knew!
Of course I did.
You useless moron!
You thought I was guiding you
out of kindness?
You, moron!
Long before you married him,
I was throttling him
and fucking him!
I was helping him
with his writing!
I'm cumming!
Cumming!
Izumi...
Let's go to the ruins.
She has always been
terribly indecent.
Don't be trapped
by the obscenity of sex, dear.
For a long time
she has given into sex.
So I cut off her indecent parts
and I contained them for her.
Officer Kimura!
Ma'am...
I know you aren't strong enough
to do this.
Officer Kimura, this way!
Father?
Yes?
I love you, Father.
Don't.
Why not...Father?
For a long time,
I've been aware that
she was a prostitute.
How despicable...
All evil comes from that man!
It's not from my side of family.
Oh, no!
She couldn't resist
his indecent blood.
So she had to go after men
every night.
It's horrendous!
Sol had to follow her,
I couldn't help myself.
And I hid and watched her.
In that horrifying ruin
of an apartment,
she did all those revolting deeds...!
Why can't I love you?
Father!
What are you talking about?
Father told me that
it shouldn't happen.
He handed me the book
and told me.
Everybody is just going
around the Castle.
- Nobody ever gets inside.
- Father.
For you, that's what I am.
I'm your Castle.
I never...
...thought of him...
...as my father.
He was a man to me.
I didn't know
what Castle meant,
but I knew it was difficult
to find my way to Father.
I finally realised
when I started this job.
That I had to find...
and reach the Castle.
But...I know I can 'Z' get to it.
But I also can 'Z' Ignore it.
The Castle...
...has a hold of me.
And it'll never let me go,
and that's why...
...I can never stop looking
for the Castle's entrance.
Until I die.
Until...
...somebody...
...ends my life for me.
I can never stop.
When you die,
will you find the Castle?
I don't know...
But...
...it's got to be better...
You're a pitiful woman.
I'm not the only pathetic one!
Me?
I'm not pathetic.
I want to kill you.
Really!
Yes. You make me want to kill you!
You want me dead?
OK then.
Stab me with this knife.
I know you're looking
for the Castle too.
Stab me now! I know you want to!
Don't be ridiculous.
I know what you want.
I can help you end your pain.
- What?
- End the pain!
Bullshit!
- End it!
- What?
- No more pain!
- Stop it!
- Stop it!
- What are they doing anyway?
I asked to have her
indecent parts cut off.
And I brought them home.
To seal off all the bad seeds.
So you did not kill Mitsuko.
- Who did it?
- Oh, I got all the help I needed.
Yes, the family is now back
to what it was before.
Who did it?
Detective, I need you!
I have to step in.
Izumi, this is all wrong.
You have to strangle her.
Come on, now.
Izumi... She's right!
Come on, do it!
That's right, dear.
Strangle her for her own good.
- Young man!
- Yes.
Hold this woman's arms
so she won't fight.
Now! Are you deaf, you punk!
- Now what?
- As you can tell. Right, cunt?
End this cunt's pain.
Strangle her, damn it!
- Izumi!
- Mitsuko...
There.
- Harder.
- Tighter!
- Harder!
- Come on, harder!
Strangle me.
Come on!
Harder!
Strangle harder!
Tighter!
Harder!
End of Story
Get an ambulance!
Hi, handsome.
Looking for some fun?
How about a threesome?
Darling,
I'll show you a good time.
Hey, take it off! Hey, take it off!
Peek-a-boo! My God!
I should never have learned words...
What? it's nonsense.
- It's a poem.
- A poem?
You mean, like...poetry?
The Castle.
You're a strange one. Fuck that.
Fuck the crappy poem.
What did you say?
What did you just say?
A crappy poem.
Crappy?
I called it crappy because it is.
- You're crap!
- Say that again! I'm your customer!
I should never have learned words
Simply because I know Japanese
and bits of a foreign tongue
I stand still inside your tears
I should never have learned words
Simply because I know Japanese
and bits of a foreign tongue
I stand still inside your tears
I should never have learned words
Simply because I know Japanese
and bits of a foreign tongue
Lu:
...stand still inside your tears
How about a fuck, mister?
For a super discount!
Look at my tits wobble!
I'm sweet!
I'm good and very cheap!
A good time at a discount!
How about 5,000 yen? 3,000 yen?
Damn it, you can have me
for 1,000 yen!
- Stop acting crazy.
- I don't understand English!
I'm cheap!
- It's her!
- You again.
- This one?
- I'll take you both.
- Come with us.
- I love an action man!
Shut the fuck up!
Do you understand?
Say something, whore!
Say you're sorry!
I'd simply gaze at them
and walk away
If our world had no words
In your tears is there
As much meaning
as in the core of a fruit?
In a drop of your blood
Is there a shimmering resonance
Of the evening glow
of this world 3 sunset?
I should never have learned words
Simply because I know Japanese
and bits of a foreign tongue
I stand still inside your tears
