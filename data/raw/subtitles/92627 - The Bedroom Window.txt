CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT
HELLO.
I WASN'T SURE
YOU'D COME.
I ALMOST DIDN'T,
AND THEN I GOT LOST,
ALL TURNED AROUND.
NOTHING LOOKED THE SAME.
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?
MAYBE THAT
WOULD BE GOOD.
SOME WHITE WINE?
UH. I'M OUT OF WHITE WINE
RIGHT NOW.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
TO DRINK ALREADY.
MAYBE TOO MUCH.
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY?
MY SISTER'S
HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH HER HUSBAND.
I TOLD COLLIN
SHE NEEDED TO SEE ME.
AT THIS HOUR?
IT'S A CRISIS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
"THANKS FOR THE PARTY."
COLLIN WON'T MISS ME.
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
I JUST WORK FOR HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY.
I DON'T EITHER.
I'VE NEVER...
I KNOW.
WHY DID YOU...
WHY ARE YOU...
BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO.
AND HAVE WANTED ME
FOR A LONG TIME.
I WAS SO OBVIOUS?
I COULDN'T IGNORE IT.
AND I GUESS I'M TO THE POINT
WHERE I NEED
TO BE WANTED LIKE THAT.
COLLIN...
OH, DON'T TELL ME
COLLIN KNEW, TOO?
IF COLLIN KNEW...
YOU KNOW HIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK COLLIN
WOULD DO IF HE KNEW?
I DON'T KNOW.
MMM.
MMM.
I CAN'T MOVE.
THANK GOD.
HA HA!
BUT I HAVE TO.
EXCUSE ME. I'LL
BE RIGHT BACK.
WHEW.
Woman:
AAH! AAH!
AAH! AAH!
TERRY!
UHH!
AAH!
TERRY!
WHAT?
HELP ME!
HELP!
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL HER.
WHO WAS?
HEY, YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
HE'S GONE NOW.
HE HAD HER FROM BEHIND.
HE WAS DRAGGING HER
TOWARD THE STREET.
THERE YOU GO.
TAKE MY ARM.
LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, COME ON.
HEY,
THEY CAN SEE YOU.
HE WAS TRYING
TO KILL HER.
TO REALIZE IT WAS
REALLY HAPPENING.
DID YOU SEE HIM?
YES. HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE.
OH.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.
I'LL WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR.
20, 24... WITH
UNBELIEVABLE WHITE SKIN
AND RED HAIR COMBED
BACK LIKE A DUCK.
A DUCK TAIL.
YES.
THAT COULD'VE BEEN ME
DOWN THERE.
YOU MAY HAVE
SAVED MY LIFE.
THE PLEASURE WAS MINE.
IN FACT,
LET ME GO FURTHER.
IF I CAN BE
OF SERVICE AGAIN...
OH, DON'T.
I CAN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THAT NOW.
I'M SCARED AND LATER
THAN I SHOULD BE,
AND THAT COULD BE
TROUBLE FOR US BOTH.
ANY REGRETS?
NOT ONE.
IN SPITE
OF WHAT HAPPENED,
MAYBE BECAUSE OF IT,
IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING NIGHT
I CAN REMEMBER.
YOU?
REGRETS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ALL RIGHT!
HA HA HA HA!
ROUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT?
YOU'RE LATE.
THOUGHT MAYBE YOU SLEPT IN.
HE'S BEEN ASKING FOR YOU.
COLLIN?
GOOD LUCK.
I WANT THE CONCRETE
ON THE SITE.
IF I GET THERE
AND FIND MY BOYS
SITTING AROUND
PULLING THEIR PUDS...
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
LAST NIGHT?
WELL, SEE TO IT
THAT YOU DO.
EVERY LAST YARD
OF IT.
PARTY. WHERE DID
YOU DISAPPEAR TO?
OH, NOWHERE. I WENT HOME.
AND THE NEXT THING
I KNEW YOU WERE GONE.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S A BEAUTY, ISN'T IT?
BELONGED
TO BUGSY SEGAL.
40 YEARS OLD,
NEVER BEEN REGISTERED.
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?
A FRIEND.
GOT IT FROM A FRIEND.
HOLD IT.
FEELS GOOD,
DOESN'T IT?
THE WAY IT FITS
IN YOUR HAND.
ALMOST MAKES YOU WISH YOU
HAD A REASON TO FIRE IT.
EXCUSE ME. YOUR PAPER.
AHEM. THANK YOU.
Hi, TERRY.
Hi, LILLA.
WELL, THE MARKET'S
LOOKING UP.
HOW ARE THINGS COMING
ON THE WOOTON PROJECT?
HELLO?
IN FACT, I'D BETTER
GET BACK TO IT RIGHT NOW.
MAY I?
BE MY GUEST.
WHAT'S
SO INTERESTING?
LOOKS LIKE THE MIDEAST
IS HEATING UP AGAIN.
WELL, YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY
I NEVER READ THE NEWS.
RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT IT...
THE GIRL IN THE NEWS?
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY,
LESS THAN
HALF AN HOUR LATER.
I THINK
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
NOT THE SAME GIRL, THOUGH.
MM-MMM.
YOU SAID THE ONE
YOU SAW HAD BROWN HAIR.
MMM. GOD, IT'S SCARY.
DID THE PAPER SAY ANYTHING
ELSE ABOUT WITNESSES?
SAID THERE WEREN'T ANY.
MMM.
TERRY,
IF IT WAS THE SAME MAN
AND NO ONE ELSE SAW HIM,
I SHOULD GO FORWARD,
GIVE THE POLICE
A DESCRIPTION.
MM-HMM.
YOU COULD ASK THEM
TO KEEP
YOUR IDENTITY A SECRET.
WHAT IF THEY WOULDN'T?
IT WILL ALL COME OUT.
WHAT ABOUT A LETTER?
NO, THEY WOULDN'T PAY
MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.
THEY WOULD THINK
IT WAS FROM SOME CRANK.
OH, JESUS, TERRY,
I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
WHY SHOULD MY LIFE
BE TURNED UPSIDE-DOWN
JUST BECAUSE I HAPPENED
TO LOOK OUT OF A WINDOW?
IT'S NOT FAIR.
MM-MMM.
AM I TERRIBLE?
NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
POLICE DEPARTMENT, PLEASE.
AAH! TERRY!
I'LL TELL THEM
WHAT YOU SAW,
ONLY I'LL TELL THEM
THAT I SAW IT.
WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE BEEN
THE ONE LOOKING OUT OF IT?
HELLO? YES. I WITNESSED
AN ASSAULT LAST NIGHT... Okay.
THEY'LL PROBABLY MAKE
A HERO OUT OF ME.
BUT YOU'LL BE LYING.
HELLO?
AND I THOUGHT I'D BETTER
CALL UP ABOUT IT.
RIGHT OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT
NEAR THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
12 EAST MOUNT VERNON PLACE.
TERRY LAMBERT.
SURE.
THAT'S THE MOST
ROMANTIC THING
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY LIFE.
YOU DID THAT FOR ME.
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?
MM-HMM. TELL ME WHAT
HE LOOKED LIKE.
TALL, RED HAIR.
MM-HMM. YES,
COMBED BACK
BEHIND THE EARS
LIKE THIS.
MM-HMM.
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
UH, TAN JACKET
AND BLUE JEANS,
TENNIS SHOES.
WHEN YOU SAY TENNIS SHOES,
YOU MEAN TENNIS SHOES
OR RUNNING SHOES?
I MEAN TENNIS SHOES.
AND I'M GOING TO
MAKE LOVE TO YOU
LIKE NOBODY
EVER HAS BEFORE.
BUT I'M NOT SURE
WE'LL HAVE TIME
BEFORE THEY GET HERE.
GET HERE? TERRY!
MM-HMM.
SOME DETECTIVE. HE SOUNDED
VERY EXCITED, ACTUALLY.
OH, MY GOD.
HA HA HA.
TERRY, YOU'RE
GONNA PAY FOR THIS.
NO, YOU'D BETTER NOT.
COLLIN MIGHT BE HOME.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT
IN AN HOUR.
I'M DETECTIVE QUIRKE, AND
THIS IS DETECTIVE JESSUP.
MAY WE COME IN?
YEAH, SURE.
I'M SORRY.
NICE APARTMENT. I LIKE
THESE OLD BUILDINGS.
MM-HMM.
YOU LIVE HERE
ALONE?
YES.
WHY?
DETECTIVE JESSUP
WILL TAKE NOTES,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT YOU
WERE DOING, WHAT YOU SAW.
WELL, I'D BEEN TO A PARTY,
KIND OF AN OFFICE PARTY...
OFFICE?
WENTWORTH CONSTRUCTION.
COLLIN WENTWORTH?
YOU WORK FOR HIM?
YEAH. ANYWAY,
WE JUST CLOSED A BIG ACCOUNT,
AND WE WERE HAVING A PARTY
TO CELEBRATE.
I CAME HOME EARLY
AND WENT TO BED.
AROUND 10:00.
THEN LATER, AT 2:15...
I REMEMBER,
'CAUSE I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK...
I HEARD A SCREAM,
NOT VERY LOUD,
BUT I COULD TELL
IT CAME FROM THE PARK.
I JUMPED UP
AND I WENT TO THE WINDOW.
WHICH WINDOW?
THE BEDROOM WINDOW.
MAY WE SEE IT?
MM-HMM.
WERE THE DRAPES OPEN?
YES.
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?
RIGHT DOWN THERE.
HE HAD HER FROM BEHIND
AND WAS SORT OF DRAGGING HER
TOWARD THE STREET.
UH, SHE WAS STRUGGLING.
AND THEN HE THREW HER DOWN
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE SCREAMED
REAL LOUD, "HELP! HELP ME!"
AND THEN HE RAN AWAY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL THE POLICE?
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT,
UNTIL I READ ABOUT THAT OTHER
GIRL THAT WAS MURDERED.
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
THERE WAS A CONNECTION?
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY,
HALF HOUR LATER.
NO, MR. LAMBERT, WE THINK
THERE'S A CONNECTION, TOO.
AND WE'RE VERY GLAD
YOU CAME FORWARD.
CIGARETTE?
NO, DON'T SMOKE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
DO YOU MIND?
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THE ASSAILANT?
YES.
DESCRIBE HIM, PLEASE.
YOUNG, EARLY 20s, 6-FOOT.
ANY DISTINGUISHING MARKS
OR CHARACTERISTICS?
RED HAIR, RED HAIR,
COMBED BACK BEHIND THE EARS
IN A DUCK TAIL.
TAN JACKET, BLUE JEANS,
TENNIS SHOES.
TENNIS SHOES
OR RUNNING SHOES?
TENNIS SHOES.
WHEN YOU SAY
TAN JACKET,
DO YOU MEAN A SPORTS COAT
OR A WINDBREAKER?
WINDBREAKER.
YOU HAVE A GOOD EYE
FOR DETAIL, MR. LAMBERT.
HE PROBABLY CAME
FROM BEHIND THAT TREE.
THE GIRL SAYS
THE SIDEWALK WAS DESERTED,
THAT HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
SHE BARELY SAW HIM AT ALL.
BY THE WAY,
DO YOU KNOW HER?
THE GIRL. SHE LIVES
AROUND THE CORNER.
AHEM! NO.
SHE'S A LUCKY ONE.
THE OTHER GIRL WAS RAPED,
BEATEN TO DEATH, AND DUMPED.
YOU SAID HE WAS DRAGGING HER
TOWARD THE STREET,
AND HE WAS TRYING TO GET HER
TO HIS VEHICLE.
SHE'S A LUCKY ONE,
ALL RIGHT.
MR. LAMBERT, YOU SAID YOU
CAME BACK FROM THE PARTY,
WENT RIGHT TO BED?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WERE YOU ALONE?
YES. DIDN'T I SAY THAT?
NOT EXACTLY.
I WAS ALONE.
THAT'S WHY
HE WENT TO SLEEP, DAVE.
JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE.
AAH!
DID YOU MEAN WINDBREAKER
OR SPORTS COAT?
WINDBREAKER. WHY?
I WAS SO NERVOUS.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SEE.
THAT'S WHERE SHE LIVED,
THE GIRL THAT WAS KILLED.
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.
THIS ONE WAS ATTACKED
ON HER WAY HOME, TOO.
BUT IF IT HAPPENED
SO SOON AFTER,
HOW DID HE PLAN IT?
HOW DID HE KNOW
WHERE SHE LIVED?
I SUPPOSE HE CAME
DRIVING DOWN THIS STREET.
YOU KNOW, HE'S...
HE'S ANGRY.
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
Okay.
HE'S FRUSTRATED
AFTER HIS ABORTED ATTEMPT
OUTSIDE OF MY PLACE.
HE STOPS AT THAT STOP SIGN
RIGHT THERE.
LOOKING OVER, HE SEES A CAR
PARKED IN THE RED
IN FRONT OF THIS BUILDING.
HE SEES A GIRL LOCKED
IN THE ARMS OF HER LOVER,
HAVING A LAST
GOOD NIGHT KISS.
ON IMPULSE,
THE KILLER BACKS UP.
HE SEES THE SIDE DOOR
OF THE BUILDING,
HE PARKS,
AND RETURNS ON FOOT.
HE'S GUESSED THAT THE GIRL
LIVES IN THE BUILDING.
THAT SOON
SHE'LL BE GOING INSIDE.
HE RUNS UP THE STEPS
TO THE FRONT DOOR,
WHERE HE DOES SOMETHING
TO THE LOCK
SOMETHING THAT'LL PREVENT
THE KEY FROM OPENING IT.
AND HE SLIPS BACK DOWN
THE STEPS TO THE SIDE DOOR
TO WATCH AND TO WAIT.
THE GIRL GETS OUT
OF THE CAR,
WAVES GOOD-BYE,
GOES UP THE STEPS.
SHE TRIES TO OPEN THE DOOR,
BUT SHE CAN'T.
SHE TURNS
TO CALL AFTER HER LOVER,
BUT HE'S ALREADY
SPEEDING AWAY.
SO SHE DECIDES TO GO AROUND
TO THE SIDE DOOR.
THE POLICE TOLD YOU
ALL THAT...
ABOUT THE GIRL?
MOST OF IT. THE REST
WAS IN THE PAPER.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU HELPING ME DO
THE RIGHT THING,
GIVING THE POLICE
THE DESCRIPTION.
LET'S HOPE IT'S
OF SOME USE TO THEM.
WHEN WILL
I SEE YOU AGAIN?
SOON. VERY SOON.
THERE YOU GO.
HEY, WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
A LITTLE
LUNCH TIME SHOPPING?
UH, JUST SOME
WHITE WINE.
HAVE YOU BEEN
UP TO SOMETHING
YOU SHOULDN'T,
OLD BOY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
COP WAS HERE
TO SEE YOU.
DETECTIVE
JESSUP.
HE WANTS YOU TO CALL
HIM AT THAT NUMBER.
THANKS, COLLIN.
WELL, WHAT'S IT
ALL ABOUT?
NOTHING MUCH.
A FEW NIGHTS AGO,
I WITNESSED AN ASSAULT
ON THIS GIRL.
SOUNDS INTERESTING.
NOT A RAPE, COLLIN,
MORE OF A MUGGING.
NO BIG DEAL.
WHICH NIGHT?
WHICH NIGHT?
YEAH,
WHICH NIGHT WAS IT?
THURSDAY NIGHT.
THAT WAS THE NIGHT
OF THE PARTY.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL?
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO CALL 'EM?
YES,
I'M GOING TO CALL 'EM.
IT'S TERRY LAMBERT,
DETECTIVE JESSUP.
CERTAINLY. 7:00?
THAT WILL BE FINE.
PROBABLY GO OVER
MY STATEMENT AGAIN.
YOU KNOW THE POLICE.
FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU GET SO INVOLVED.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD SUCH A
STRONG SENSE OF CIVIC DUTY.
HEY!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU APPRECIATED
FRENCH WINE, EITHER.
I'M DEVELOPING
A TASTE FOR IT.
JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT.
YEAH, Okay.
JUST A SEC. YES?
I'M HERE TO SEE
DETECTIVE JESSUP.
THEY'RE RUNNING
LATE.
IF YOU HAVE A SEAT,
THEY'LL HAVE IT
SET UP
IN A FEW MINUTES.
YEAH. BURGLARY.
UH-HUH.
NO. OF COURSE.
YES, THANKS.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
LATE SETTING WHAT UP?
YOU SAID THEY WERE RUNNING
LATE SETTING SOMETHING UP.
YOU'RE HERE FOR
THE LINE-UP, AREN'T YOU?
THE LINE-UP?
YES.
NO, I THINK I WAS SUPPOSED
TO JUST COME DOWN...
YOU MUST BE THE ONE.
I MEAN, THEY TOLD ME
THERE WAS A WITNESS.
YES.
SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING.
OH, Hi.
OF COURSE,
YOU TWO MUST HAVE
BUT I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO REFRAIN FROM DOING SO
DURING THE PROCEEDINGS.
RIGHT THIS WAY.
NOW THERE ARE 6 MEN
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT.
DON'T WORRY. THEY WON'T
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT YOU,
BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE
SEE MORE THAN THEY REALIZE.
BUT MR. LAMBERT HERE,
HE GOT A GOOD LOOK
AT THE MAN.
YOU DID?
WELL, I, UH...
Jessup: STEP RIGHT UP,
GENTLEMEN. DON'T BE SHY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
LOOK AT EACH ONE...
VERY CAREFULLY.
FACE LEFT, GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE.
BUT YOU DID GET A GOOD
LOOK AT HIM THAT NIGHT.
GOOD ENOUGH
TO GIVE US
THAT DETAILED
DESCRIPTION.
BUT SEEING THEM ALL TOGETHER
LIKE THIS,
I JUST CAN'T BE SURE.
BUT SURELY IF YOU
WERE TO COME
FACE-TO-FACE
WITH THE MAN
YOU DESCRIBED
IN SUCH DETAIL,
YOU'D RECOGNIZE HIM,
WOULDN'T YOU?
YES, I THINK SO.
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.
YOUR HUNCH WAS WRONG.
ONE OF THE MEN
YOU SAW TONIGHT
HAS DONE THIS KIND
OF THING BEFORE.
THAT, COMBINED WITH
YOUR DESCRIPTION...
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
I WAS WRONG.
WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO KEEP LOOKING.
SORRY.
I'M SORRY
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE...
AT EDGAR'S.
I DON'T THINK...
I COCKTAIL THERE.
IT'S NOT MY NIGHT
FOR RECOGNIZING PEOPLE.
I WAS WALKING HOME FROM WORK
THE NIGHT IT HAPPENED.
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
THERE'S A LOT I DON'T DO.
CAN'T DO
TILL I KNOW WHO HE IS.
THEY SEEM PRETTY SURE
THAT THE SAME GUY
ATTACKED
THAT OTHER GIRL.
ONLY SHE'S DEAD,
AND I'M ALIVE.
I SHOULD FEEL LUCKY,
I GUESS.
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL CATCH HIM?
I HOPE SO.
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
HE'S NOT EVEN
TELLING HER ABOUT IT.
YOU'LL SEE WHEN
HE TAKES HIS HOOD OFF.
WHAT IF IT IS HIM?
WHAT DO WE DO?
FIRST, YOU'LL HAVE TO
TELL ME WHETHER IT IS.
TERRY, THERE MUST BE
HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN
IN BALTIMORE WITH RED HAIR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK...
THERE! LOOK.
Man: YOU CAN'T
WELD IT DOWN HERE.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
A BETTER LOOK.
THAT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?
COME ON, SYLVIA.
HE'S JUST WHAT YOU SAID,
THE HAIR, THE SIZE,
EVERYTHING.
EVEN THE WHITE SKIN.
I CAN'T SAY.
NOT FOR SURE.
WHY NOT?
I JUST CAN'T.
BUT IT MIGHT
BE HIM.
IT MIGHT BE.
BUT WHAT GOOD
DOES THAT DO?
WHAT GOOD DOES ANY OF IT DO?
I COULDN'T
GO FORWARD BEFORE.
IT WOULD BE WORSE NOW.
IF HE DID WHAT HE DID
TO THOSE GIRLS
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IT, TERRY.
I AM NOT SURE.
THAT DETECTIVE QUIRKE...
HE SAID THAT ONE OF
THE MEN IN THE LINE-UP
WAS THERE BECAUSE
HE HAD RAPED BEFORE.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
THIS IS THE ONE
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
I'M SORRY, TERRY.
I KNOW
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
LET'S NOT SPEND OUR TIME
DRIVING AROUND, Okay?
Okay.
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
FROM THE BAR?
UH, YEAH. A BEER.
DRAFT?
YEAH.
HEY.
OH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WHOA!
YEAH! WHOO!
WHOO! WHOO! WHOO!
GOOD LORD, HAVE MERCY.
Men:
TABLE! TABLE!
Men, chanting:
TABLE! TABLE! TABLE!
TABLE! TABLE! TABLE!
Man: YEAH!
NO KEEP GOING!
GO AROUND!
AND ME,
MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF.
HERE, WATCH THIS.
READY FOR ANOTHER?
NO, THANKS.
OH! OH, MY GOD! OH!
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
NO, REALLY.
LET ME BUY YOU
A DRINK.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
IT'LL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.
Okay, Okay.
IT'LL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.
♪ TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS
AND MAKE LOVE TO ME ♪
DON'T WANT TO WAKE THEM.
NO SUCH LUCK.
CHRIS, IS THAT YOU?
YOU COME UP HERE!
I'M TIRED OF YOU
BEING OUT
TILL ALL HOURS
OF THE NIGHT!
I TOLD YOU TO BE IN THIS
HOUSE BEFORE MIDNIGHT!
IF THIS EVER
HAPPENS AGAIN,
YOU'RE PACKING YOUR
THINGS AND LEAVING!
I MEAN IT!
GO ON DOWN!
YOU BE QUIET ABOUT
IT DOWN THERE!
THAT'S IT.
GET HER OUT OF HERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THEY FOUND HER BODY STUFFED
IN THERE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
ANY IDEA WHO SHE IS?
NAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
INTERESTING.
HERE'S PETERS.
IS THIS
WHAT TIME
DON'T START, HUH?
I HEAR YOU GOT SOMETHING.
PETERS. STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE
TOLD QUITE A STORY.
I'D LIKE TO ASK
SOME QUESTIONS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU IDENTIFY
HENDERSON AT THE LINE-UP?
HENDERSON?
THAT'S HIM...
CHRIS HENDERSON.
I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE
A MISTAKE.
AT NIGHT, TO SEE HIM
UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
UNUSUALLY
CONSCIENTIOUS.
AT NIGHT YOU
BECAME POSITIVE
HE ATTACKED MISS CONNELLY? YES.
YOU STILL DIDN'T IDENTIFY HIM.
YOU WAITED...
2 DAYS.
WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? HAVE WE
ENOUGH FOR A SEARCH WARRANT?
WITH LAMBERT'S POSITIVE
I.D., HENDERSON'S RECORD.
CAN I TIE HENDERSON
TO THE DEAD GIRLS?
SHE WAS IN A BAR
LAST NIGHT.
I'LL SEE IF ANYONE THERE
RECOGNIZES HIS PICTURE.
I CAN PROBABLY GET THE
WARRANT WITHOUT IT,
THANKS, MR. LAMBERT.
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.
I ONLY WISH
I HAD HELPED SOONER.
EVEN IF YOU'D IDENTIFIED
HENDERSON EARLIER,
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
ARRESTED HIM.
HE'D OF STILL BEEN OUT ON
THE STREET LAST NIGHT.
OUR CONCERN ISN'T
THE ASSAULT ITSELF...
EXCEPT AS IT HELPS
TO BUILD A MURDER CASE.
AND THANKS TO YOU,
IT'S HELPING.
MAYBE WE'LL TIE HENDERSON
TO THE DEAD GIRLS.
IF WE DO,
WE'RE OFF AND RUNNING.
DON'T TORTURE YOURSELF
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
WHAT YOU DID WAS RIGHT,
THERE'S NO DOUBT.
I JUST WISH YOU
HADN'T HAD TO DO IT.
HE COULD COME BACK
AND HURT US.
MY STATEMENT'S ONLY A TOOL
FOR THEIR SEARCH WARRANT.
BEYOND THAT, THEY
DON'T CARE ABOUT ME
YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM YOU
FOLLOWED HIM TO THE BAR?
EITHER I RECOGNIZED HIM
AT NIGHT OR I DIDN'T.
I HAD NO REASON
TO FOLLOW HIM.
SUPPOSE THEY DISCOVER
YOU LIED?
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME.
I PROMISE I WON'T LET
THEM FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.
HELLO?
OH, HOW ARE YOU,
DETECTIVE QUIRKE?
I SEE.
THANKS FOR
LETTING ME KNOW.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
WHAT? WHAT DID HE WANT?
THEY GOT
THE SEARCH WARRANT.
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU WANTED?
I GUESS SO, BUT...
NOBODY AT THE BAR
REMEMBERED HENDERSON.
BUT THEY'VE GOT
THE WARRANT ANYWAY?
YEAH. MY STATEMENT WAS ENOUGH.
THAT'LL BE
THE END OF IT.
TO CONNECT HIM TO THE
MURDERS OR THEY WON'T.
THEY'RE DONE
WITH ME.
THE SEARCH WAS SOMEWHAT
DISAPPOINTING.
NO FINGERPRINTS, NO BLOOD
SAMPLES, NO CLOTHING.
NOTHING TO PROVE HENDERSON
EVER CAME IN CONTACT
SOME COTTON FIBERS MATCH
THE SWEATER OF ONE GIRL,
BUT IT'S COMMON FIBER.
WE FOUND SOME
PEPPERMINT-FLAVORED TOOTHPICKS
IN THE TRUCK'S
GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
EACH GIRL WAS PREVENTED
FROM ENTERING HER RESIDENCE
BY A TOOTHPICK
JAMMED INTO THE KEYHOLE
AND THEN BROKEN OFF
THE NEWSPAPERS MENTIONED
JAMMED LOCKS.
WE HELD BACK
ABOUT THE TOOTHPICKS.
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
I'LL LET PETERS EXPLAIN.
JESUS, THAT HOLDEN'S
A BREAKING JUDGE.
HAVE YOU FILLED HIM IN?
I WAS JUST
STARTING TO.
WE GOT A MURDER CASE
WE CAN'T WIN,
SOME INSIGNIFICANT
COTTON FIBERS,
SOME TOOTHPICKS
ANYONE COULD POSSESS.
MY ASSISTANT
LEARNED THAT BRAND
IS GIVEN AWAY IN LOTS OF
BALTIMORE RESTAURANTS.
SO HE DIDN'T DO IT?
HE COULD HAVE
RAPED THE GIRLS,
HAMMERED THEM TO DEATH
WITH HIS FIST.
HE COULD HAVE THROWN AWAY
THE GLOVES HE WORE,
ANY ARTICLES OF CLOTHING
WITH BLOOD ON THEM.
A CAR WASH WOULD HAVE
CLEANED HIS TRUCK. WHEW!
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
WE CAN'T PROVE
THAT HE DID IT.
SO DETECTIVE QUIRKE AND I
HAVE AGREED
TO GO WITH
THE ASSAULT CASE.
WE PROSECUTE HENDERSON
ON THE ASSAULT CASE.
WE CAN WIN THAT.
IT'S OPEN AND SHUT.
WE GOT A WITNESS WHO
SAW HIM DO IT... YOU.
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT THE ASSAULT.
I DON'T IF THERE'S
A CHANCE FOR MURDER,
BUT WE'RE UP AGAINST IT.
WE AREN'T GIVING UP
ON THE MURDER CASES.
WE MIGHT GET LUCKY
WHEN HE'S IN PRISON.
YOU MEAN SOMEONE
MAY KILL HIM?
I DOUBT THAT LUCKY.
I MEANT HENDERSON MIGHT
SHOOT OFF HIS MOUTH
TO SOMEBODY WHO WANTS
TO MAKE A DEAL.
MEANWHILE, HE DOESN'T
HURT ANYONE.
HOW ABOUT BEING
A STAR WITNESS?
I...
THIS ISN'T WHAT
I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE A BREEZE.
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO
IS TELL THE TRUTH.
YOU SAID
THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN.
YOU'LL HAVE TO
TESTIFY UNDER OATH.
HOW DO YOU THINK
I FEEL?
WHY DID I HAVE TO
LOOK OUT THAT WINDOW?
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
CALL THE POLICE?
IF HE'S NOT PUT AWAY,
HE COULD KILL AGAIN.
ALL HE'S BEING TRIED FOR
IS ASSAULT. WHAT A MESS.
IT'S NOT YOUR MESS.
IT'S MINE.
I'LL PROTECT YOU
FROM IT.
SO FAR, ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS GRANDSTAND.
FIRST FOR ME,
AND NOW FOR THEM.
YOU BELIEVE THAT?
YOU WANTED TO BE
THE HERO.
SEE WHERE
IT'S GOTTEN US?
I AM THE ONE
WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE!
SYLVIA.
HEY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.
HOW LONG... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
I'LL WALK A WHILE
IF YOU LIKE.
OH, I'M... I'M GOING.
I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THEY'RE
GOING TO PROSECUTE
WHAT HAPPENED? YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT IT LATER AND WERE SURE?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'M BETTER. I'M DOING
THINGS LIKE THIS NOW.
I USED TO RUN AT NIGHT.
MOSTLY I'M JUST
WAITING TO TESTIFY.
IT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.
I'M NERVOUS. ARE YOU?
YOUR TESTIMONY IS MUCH
MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE.
EVEN IF I HAVE TO GET UP ON
THE STAND, I WANT TO GET HIM.
YOU MUST FEEL
THE SAME WAY.
YEAH.
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME
TO SEE SOMEONE WHO'S NOT
AFRAID TO COME FORWARD.
I'M NOT DOING SO MUCH.
YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.
THAT'S MORE THAN
MOST PEOPLE WOULD DO.
SEE YOU IN COURT.
OH, TERRY, I'M SO ASHAMED.
DO YOU HATE ME?
OF COURSE I WANT
TO STAND BY YOU.
I'M JUST SCARED.
SO AM I.
YOU FORGIVE ME?
DO YOU?
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
I WANT TO.
I DIDN'T.
AND I WANT TO COME
TO THE TRIAL.
WHEN YOU TESTIFY,
YOU'LL BE TESTIFYING
FOR BOTH OF US.
YOU'LL BE SAYING
THE WORDS,
BUT THEY'LL BE
MY WORDS.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE
WITH YOU.
THIS WAY.
STATE YOUR NAME
FOR THE COURT, PLEASE.
YOU SWEAR THE EVIDENCE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE
IS THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH?
YES.
PLEASE TAKE
THE STAND.
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING ON
APRIL 21st AT 2:15 A.M.?
LOOKING OUT
MY BEDROOM WINDOW.
YOUR BEDROOM OVERLOOKS
THE PARK?
YES.
A MAN FIGHTING
WITH A WOMAN.
PHYSICALLY FIGHTING?
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
AS EXACTLY AS YOU ARE ABLE
HE HAD HOLD OF HER FROM
BEHIND, TRYING TO DRAG HER...
OBJECTION. CONCLUSION.
SUSTAINED.
WAS HE DRAGGING HER?
YES, TOWARD THE STREET.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
HE THREW HER DOWN
ON HER FACE,
GRABBED HOLD
OF HER NECK,
AND STARTED
TO STRANGLE HER.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WENT TO YELL
OUT MY WINDOW.
SHE SCREAMED,
AND HE RAN AWAY.
I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK
AROUND THIS COURTROOM.
DO YOU SEE THE MAN YOU
SAW ATTACK THAT GIRL?
YES.
PLEASE POINT HIM OUT.
LET THE RECORD SHOW THE WITNESS
IS POINTING AT THE DEFENDANT.
YOU ARE SURE THE DEFENDANT
IS THE MAN YOU SAW?
YES, I AM.
THANK YOU, MR. LAMBERT.
ONE MOMENT, MR. LAMBERT.
THERE ARE TWO LAWYERS
IN THIS CASE.
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU
THROUGH THIS ONE MORE TIME.
PERHAPS IN A LITTLE
MORE DETAIL.
YOU WERE IN YOUR APARTMENT
ON EAST MOUNT VERNON PLACE.
YOU LOOKED OUT
YOUR WINDOW
AND YOU SAW A MAN
FIGHTING WITH A WOMAN.
YES.
WHAT TIME WAS THAT?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING JUST PRIOR
TO LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW?
JUST PRIOR?
WERE YOU
WATCHING TELEVISION?
READING?
CHATTING WITH FRIENDS?
SLEEPING.
IN YOUR BED?
YES.
NOT IN A CHAIR?
NO, I WAS IN MY BED.
WHEN DID YOU
GO TO BED?
AROUND 11:00.
YOU HAD BEEN TO A PARTY
THAT NIGHT, CORRECT?
YES.
DID YOU HAVE
MUCH TO DRINK?
NO. I LEFT EARLY.
I HAD BEEN WORKING
HARD AND WAS TIRED.
SO YOU WENT HOME
TO GET SOME SLEEP.
YOU'RE SOUND ASLEEP
AT 2:00 A.M.
WHAT WOKE YOU UP?
I HEARD A SCREAM.
THERE WERE TWO MUFFLED SCREAMS.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WENT TO THE WINDOW.
DID YOU TURN ON
A LIGHT?
DID YOU STOP
TO GET SOME MILK?
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW
THIS MAN AND WOMAN FIGHTING.
I WENT TO OPEN THE
WINDOW, BUT IT STUCK.
THE WOMAN
SCREAMED,
DID HE RUN AWAY AS
SOON AS SHE SCREAMED?
SHE SCREAMED TWICE,
"HELP! HELP ME!"
AND THE MAN RAN AWAY,
I THINK.
WELL, IT ALL HAPPENED
PRETTY QUICKLY.
HOW QUICKLY?
WHAT?
YOU SAW
THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING.
THE WOMAN SCREAMED,
THE MAN RAN AWAY.
IT HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.
HOW QUICKLY?
FIVE SECONDS?
UH... IT MUST HAVE BEEN
LONGER THAN THAT.
FOR ALL THAT
TO HAPPEN. YEAH.
WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY
THAT YOU SAW THIS MAN
FOR A BRIEF TIME PERIOD,
DURING MOST OF WHICH
HE WAS MOVING QUICKLY.
WOULD THAT BE
AN ACCURATE STATEMENT?
HOW FAR IS IT
FROM YOUR WINDOW
TO THE FOUNTAIN STEPS?
15 YARDS?
IT'S 22 YARDS.
IT'S 22 YARDS.
I NEVER MEASURED.
WELL, WE DID
MEASURE IT.
THE NIGHT OF APRIL 21st,
WAS THAT A CLEAR NIGHT?
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR.
SO VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.
THERE ARE
STREETLIGHTS ALSO.
THERE ARE THREE,
SPACED ALONG THE BLOCK.
YES. THE PARK'S
WELL-LIT.
WELL-LIT?
OH, YES.
AS WELL-LIT
AS THIS COURTROOM?
NO.
YOU'RE SURE?
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE YOU'RE SURE.
YOUR HONOR,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENT?
THIS EXPERIMENT
IS RELEVANT?
YES. IT'LL TAKE
TWO MINUTES.
THE COURT CAN INDULGE
DEFENSE COUNSEL
FOR TWO MINUTES.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
ONE THING
BEFORE WE BEGIN...
MR. LAMBERT, WOULD YOU
REMOVE YOUR CONTACT LENSES?
YOUR CONTACT LENSES. YOU'RE
WEARING THEM, AREN'T YOU?
YES.
THEN KINDLY
REMOVE THEM.
MR. LAMBERT WEARS
HARD CONTACT LENSES.
THAT'S TRUE,
ISN'T IT?
THEY'RE IRRITATING
IF YOU SLEEP WITH THEM IN.
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM
OUT THAT NIGHT.
ISN'T THAT TRUE?
HE JUST SAID THAT WHEN
HE WAS AWAKENED BY SCREAMS,
HE HURRIED TO THE WINDOW
WITHOUT MAKING ANY STOPS.
SURELY HE WON'T NOW SAY
HE PUT IN CONTACT LENSES.
WILL YOU?
NO, I DIDN'T
HAVE THEM IN.
SO I REPEAT MY REQUEST
THAT YOU REMOVE THEM.
I THINK YOU'D BETTER
REMOVE THEM. HERE.
NO, I, UH...
I HAVE
A LENS CASE.
NOW, MR. LAMBERT,
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW
TO THE FOUNTAIN STEPS.
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.
OBJECTION.
IF WE ARE TO RE-CREATE
THE CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER WHICH THE WITNESS
OBSERVED THE DEFENDANT,
SURELY IT SHOULD BE DONE
PROPERLY, BY EXPERTS.
LET'S INDULGE DEFENSE
COUNSELOR FOR TWO MINUTES.
FRANKLY, I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE
THIS IS HEADING. PROCEED.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
MR. LAMBERT, I'M HOLDING
IN MY HAND AN OBJECT.
COULD YOU KINDLY
TELL THE COURT
WHAT THIS OBJECT IS?
IT'S A...
YOU'RE HOLDING, UM...
COME ON, MR. LAMBERT.
WHAT IS IT?
I CAN'T QUITE
MAKE IT OUT.
COME ON, MR. LAMBERT.
WHAT IS IT?
AAH!
AAH! AAH!
HELP!
HELP ME!
SHALL I GIVE YOU A HINT,
MR. LAMBERT?
IS IT A CAP?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
IS IT A LADY'S SLIPPER?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
IS IT A RED WIG?
WELL, LET'S TRY IT
WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
HOW ABOUT NOW,
MR. LAMBERT?
I CAN SEE...
I CAN SEE THAT
SOMETHING'S THERE.
BUT YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY IT,
NOT EVEN
WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
JUST A BOOK, MR. LAMBERT.
JUST A RED BOOK.
I SEE WHY
MOTOR VEHICLES STIPULATES
THAT YOU CAN'T DRIVE
WITHOUT GLASSES OR CONTACTS.
YOU'RE SHORTSIGHTED.
YES.
IN FACT, YOU'RE
EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED.
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT EXTREMELY.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE THAT A PERSON WHO
FAILED TO DISTINGUISH AN OBJECT
IN A BRIGHTLY LIT COURTROOM
FROM 20 YARDS AWAY
COULD FAIRLY BE DESCRIBED
AS EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED?
YES.
WOULDN'T YOU ALSO AGREE
THAT IT WOULD BE UNLIKELY
THAT AN EXTREMELY
SHORTSIGHTED PERSON
COULD POSITIVELY IDENTIFY
SOMEONE GLIMPSED AT NIGHT
FROM 22 YARDS AWAY
FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS?
YOU NEVER SAID
YOU'RE NEARSIGHTED!
YOU NEVER ASKED.
WITH MOTOR VEHICLE
REGISTRATION!
ACCUSED ASSAILANT
CHRIS HENDERSON
THE CASE AGAINST HIM
DISMISSED
FOR INSUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE.
BALTIMORE POLICE REPORT
NO NEW LEADS
IN THE SO-CALLED
DUMPSTER MURDERS.
COULD I TALK TO YOU, PLEASE?
I'M YOUR NEIGHBOR.
IT'S FUNNY HOW TWO PEOPLE
CAN LIVE SO CLOSE
AND...
MY NAME IS KATHY.
KATHY HOFFNER.
TERRY LAMBERT.
OH, PLEASE EXCUSE
THE WAY I LOOK.
I'M SUCH A SLOB TODAY.
I HEARD YOUR FOOTSTEPS
ON THE STAIRS,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
PROBABLY YOU,
SO I JUST THREW THIS ON
AND CAME OUT.
WELL, I'M JUST
GETTING HOME.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER
TO SAY ANYTHING,
I FEEL FUNNY ABOUT TALKING
BEHIND PEOPLE'S BACKS.
TALK TO WHO?
THE POLICE.
THE POLICE.
OH, YOU MEAN BACK THEN.
I TALKED TO THEM
BACK THEN, TOO.
THEY ASKED ME IF I WAS
AWAKENED BY THE ATTACK.
THEY WERE HERE
AGAIN TODAY.
TODAY?
THEY ASKED ME IF
I SAW YOU THAT NIGHT.
SEEN ME?
FIRST I THOUGHT
I HADN'T.
THEN I REMEMBERED
THAT I HAD PEEKED OUT
WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS
COMING UP THE STAIRS.
I WAS NERVOUS
AFTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
WHAT DID YOU SEE?
I SAW YOU
COMING BACK IN.
THIS WAS LATER, AFTER THE
EXCITEMENT HAD DIED DOWN.
I WENT OUT
FOR SOME AIR.
DID YOU SEE ME
GO OUT?
THE POLICE ASKED ME
THE SAME QUESTION.
I JUST SAW YOU COMING IN.
MUST HAVE BEEN AFTER 3:00.
OH, I'M SURE IT WASN'T THAT LATE.
NO.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
KNOW ABOUT THE POLICE.
ANYTIME.
ANYTIME AT ALL.
YOU HEARD
THEY LET HIM GO.
IT'S SICKENING,
ISN'T IT?
WANT A BEER?
THANKS. I WOULD.
SO THAT'S THE FAMOUS
BEDROOM WINDOW?
YEAH.
DO YOU MIND?
I KNOW, TERRY.
WHAT?
IT WASN'T YOU
IN THE BEDROOM WINDOW.
SHE WAS THE WITNESS.
SHE SAW IT, NOT YOU.
WHO? I'M SORRY
THEY LET HIM GO.
BUT YOU WENT FORWARD...
SAVE IT, TERRY!
I SAW HER IN THE PARK,
AND I SAW HER IN COURT
COACHING YOU. PATHETIC.
WHAT, IS SHE MARRIED?
MUST BE,
TO SOMEONE POWERFUL.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, REALLY. WHAT
MATTERS IS HE'S OUT THERE, FREE.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN
BE DONE ABOUT THAT.
THEY CAN'T
TRY HIM AGAIN.
NOT FOR ATTACKING ME,
BUT WITH
SOME MORE INFORMATION,
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET HIM
FOR WHAT HE DID
TO THE OTHERS,
THE GIRLS THAT DIDN'T HAVE SOMEONE
LIKE YOU TO PROTECT THEM.
THE QUESTION ISN'T
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,
IT'S WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO
AND WHAT IS SHE
GOING TO DO?
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO WATCH.
THANKS FOR THE BEER.
TERRY!
THE COPS HAVE BEEN HERE.
THEY JUST LEFT.
HERE? THEY WANT
ME TO CALL THEM?
THEY DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU...
THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOU.
ABOUT ME?
HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN HERE,
WHAT YOU'RE LIKE.
THEY ALSO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE
NIGHT OF THAT PARTY WE HAD.
WHAT YOUR MOOD WAS,
WHY YOU LEFT EARLY.
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THEY
SUSPECT YOU OF SOMETHING.
DID THEY ASK
ANYTHING ELSE?
IF I'D NOTICED
ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT YOU
ON APRIL 26 OR 27.
WHAT?
THEY THINK YOU KEEP
A DIARY OF MY MOODS?
WHY WOULD THEY ASK ABOUT
THOSE DATES IN PARTICULAR?
WHO KNOWS?
ANYWAY, THANKS, COLLIN. I'M
SORRY THEY BOTHERED YOU.
THE POLICE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU, NOT YET.
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING
MY NEIGHBORS.
I THINK THEY'VE
TAPPED MY PHONE.
THEY'VE BEEN
WATCHING ME.
SHE SAW YOU IN COURT.
SHE'S FIGURED IT OUT.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
TERRY, YOU MADE A MISTAKE,
A SIMPLE MISTAKE.
THE POLICE
WOULDN'T DO THAT.
THEY WERE AT THE
OFFICE THIS MORNING
QUESTIONING
COLLIN.
COLLIN?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY WOULD THEY
QUESTION COLLIN?
ABOUT ME! SYLVIA!
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO TELL YOU!
DO THEY SUSPECT YOU WERE...
WITH SOMEBODY?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY SUSPECT.
IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE WONDERING
IF MAYBE I DIDN'T
KILL THOSE GIRLS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT THE
BLAME ON SOMEBODY ELSE.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE BEING PARANOID.
ANYWAY, WHAT DID THEY
TALK TO COLLIN ABOUT?
THEY ASKED
ABOUT APRIL 26,
THAT'S THE DATE OF
THE SECOND MURDER.
THEY ALSO ASKED HIM ABOUT
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY...
WHY I LEFT EARLY.
THE PARTY?
WHAT IF COLLIN STARTS
THINKING ABOUT THE PARTY?
WELL, ONE WAY, THAT WOULD
PARTIALLY SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO BE SO
AFRAID TO GO TO THE POLICE.
GO TO THE POLICE?
I CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.
BESIDES, I THINK YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING THE WHOLE THING.
WHAT ABOUT THE
REDHEAD, HENDERSON?
IF YOU'D TESTIFIED,
HE WOULDN'T HAVE.
I NEVER SAID IT WAS HIM.
I WAS NEVER SURE.
YOU MADE UP YOUR OWN
MIND ABOUT THAT.
IF IT WAS HIM,
HE COULD DO IT AGAIN.
STOP IT, TERRY.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THIS IS HAPPENING.
BESIDES, IT'LL WORK OUT.
THE POLICE AREN'T FOOLS.
WHAT ABOUT DENISE CONNELLY? WHO?
THE GIRL
THAT WAS ATTACKED!
SHE KNOWS ALL
ABOUT US.
TELL HER WE NEED A LITTLE TIME.
I HAVE TO THINK.
SHE'LL BE REASONABLE,
WON'T SHE?
MAYBE.
SHE HAS TO BE.
I DIDN'T GET US INTO THIS.
YOU KNOW THAT.
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
I DO.
I NEVER EVEN KNEW YOU
WORE CONTACT LENSES.
LITTLE REVERSE ENGLISH, YOU'D
HAVE DONE ALL RIGHT, AL.
THANKS, DENISE.
♪ AND IF YOU EVER TOUCH
MY WOMAN ♪
♪ WELL, BOY,
YOU'RE GONNA WEAR THE SCARS ♪
♪ CHECK IT OUT... ♪
HELLO.
Hi.
I NEED TO TALK.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
♪ CHECK IT OUT ♪
♪ YOU'RE RUNNIN'
OUT OF TIME... ♪
UH, C.C.,
COVER ME, WILL YOU?
♪ WITH A CRIMINAL MIND ♪
♪ AH YA YA YA... ♪
NOW, THE POLICE SEEM TO HAVE
GOTTEN IT INTO THEIR HEADS
THAT MAYBE I HAD
SOMETHING TO DO
THEY KNOW YOU LIED.
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHY.
YEAH. DID YOU SEE ANY
OF IT THAT NIGHT?
SHE SAW IT, BUT
SHE WOULDN'T GO FORWARD,
SO YOU TOOK HER PLACE.
I THOUGHT I COULD
BRING IT OFF.
AND SHE LET YOU?
YOU'RE EITHER
A ROMANTIC FOOL,
OR YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
I DON'T KNOW
WHICH IS WORSE.
WHAT DOES SHE SAY NOW,
NOW THAT YOU'RE IN A SPOT?
SHE WANTS TO WAIT...
GIVE TIME TO THE
POLICE TO SORT IT OUT.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HER POSITION.
SURE, I DO. SHE HAS A HUSBAND
AND A STUD ON THE SIDE,
AND NOBODY THE WISER. SHE
WANTS TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
UH, DENISE...
YEAH. SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?
IF I HAD IT TO DO OVER,
I'D DO IT DIFFERENTLY.
BUT IT WAS MY IDEA TO
HANDLE IT THE WAY WE DID,
AND I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S FAIR FOR ME
UNLESS SHE'S COME TO THE
SAME CONCLUSION I HAVE.
LIKE I SAID,
A ROMANTIC FOOL.
WHAT ABOUT HENDERSON?
SHE'S NOT SURE IT WAS
HENDERSON, AND SHE NEVER WAS.
BUT YOU WERE SURE. THAT
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
AND I'D LIKE TO TELL IT TO YOU SOMEDAY.
I WOULD.
BUT RIGHT NOW, DENISE, ALL I
WANT IS A LITTLE MORE TIME.
DENISE, SERIOUSLY.
COME ON.
BUT I'M GIVING THE TIME
TO YOU, NOT TO HER.
YOU'RE THE ROMANTIC FOOL.
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE'S DOING.
♪ OH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH ♪
♪ NA, NA, NA ♪
Child: I'VE GOT IT!
HA HA HA!
MR. LAMBERT?
GOOD MORNING.
WOULD YOU MIND
COMING WITH ME?
DETECTIVE QUIRKE AND I WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES.
SHALL I FOLLOW YOU?
THAT'S Okay.
I'LL BRING YOU BACK.
MR. LAMBERT.
SEEMS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
EXACTLY TRUTHFUL WITH US.
OH, YES. I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE CONTACTS.
THAT'S OUR FAULT.
WE SHOULD HAVE ASKED.
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT.
WE'VE LEARNED THAT
YOU WENT OUT THAT NIGHT.
YOU TOLD US YOU WERE IN BED.
YES.
THAT YOU WERE AWAKENED,
YOU WITNESSED THE ATTACK,
AND THEN YOU WENT
RIGHT BACK TO BED.
YES, I DID GO OUT.
I... I FORGOT.
YOU FORGOT?
YES, I...
YEAH, I DID. IT'S...
WHEN DID YOU GO OUT?
UH, AFTERWARD,
BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SLEEP.
I WENT TO GET SOME AIR
AND LOOK AROUND.
I WAS ALL KEYED UP.
IT'S...
WHEN DID YOU
COME BACK?
A FEW MINUTES LATER.
THAT'S WHY I FORGOT.
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
YOU'VE BEEN QUESTIONING
MY NEIGHBORS
AND MY BOSS,
AND YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING ME FOLLOWED,
BUT I...
LOOK, YOU DON'T
REALLY THINK THAT I'M...
I'M NOT A SUSPECT,
AM I?
SUPPOSE YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE BAR.
WHAT BAR?
WHERE THE MURDERED
GIRL STEPHANIE LUGIE
SPENT THE LAST
HOURS OF HER LIFE,
WHERE NO ONE... NO
ONE... CAN REMEMBER
HAVING SEEN THE REDHEAD
CHRIS HENDERSON.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS REMEMBERS
YOU QUITE CLEARLY.
SHE SPILLED
A DRINK ON YOU.
WAS THAT SOMETHING
ELSE YOU FORGOT?
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT PICTURE?
AM I...
ARE YOU ARRESTING ME?
NO. NOT JUST YET.
WE'RE MOVING A LITTLE
SLOWER THIS TIME AROUND.
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD
ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS
UNTIL I CONSULT
AN ATTORNEY.
THAT MIGHT BE
WELL-ADVISED.
HELLO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU
CAN'T JUST CALL HERE!
WE HAVE TO TALK.
THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE!
I HAVE TO SEE YOU
RIGHT AWAY.
NO! I CAN'T
SEE YOU.
I CAN'T SEE YOU
AT ALL ANYMORE.
I'VE BEEN TO THE POLICE.
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING ME.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I CAN'T SEE YOU,
AND I CAN'T
TALK TO YOU.
SYLVIA,
DON'T MAKE ME...
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
DON'T HANG UP ON ME!
GOODBYE!
WHO WAS THAT, DEAR?
TERRY.
TERRY LAMBERT.
TELL MRS. WENTWORTH
IT'S TERRY LAMBERT.
WAS SHE EXPECTING YOU?
I'M SORRY,
BUT SHE ISN'T HERE.
YOU TELL HER,
OR SHALL I?
SHE'S NOT HERE.
NO ONE'S HERE.
WHERE ARE THEY?
DAMN IT!
WHERE HAVE THEY GONE?
THE BALLET.
THEY'VE GONE
TO THE BALLET.
I don't know.
Listen, I'm going
to talk with him.
What are you doing here?
You gave me no choice.
Are you crazy?
People will see us!
We've gone past
where any of that matters.
You may have.
I haven't.
Our affair, the fact that
you witnessed the attack...
I'VE TOLD YOU...
I WILL NEVER, NEVER
SYLVIA! I'VE TOLD YOU
THAT FROM THE START!
SHH!
DON'T TOUCH ME!
THEY SUSPECT ME OF MURDER.
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWED.
THEY MAY HAVE
FOLLOWED ME HERE.
THEY MAY BE WATCHING
ME RIGHT NOW.
THEN YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE
BUT TO TALK TO COLLIN MYSELF.
I'M SORRY, TERRY, BUT
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM.
I HAD A FEELING...
TOLD HIM WHAT?
THAT I WENT TO BED
WITH YOU... ONCE.
ON CONDITION I SWEAR I WAS IN BED
WITH HIM THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
DRAGGED INTO THAT MESS!
I TOLD HIM I WOULD.
HEY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, THANK YOU.
I'M FINE.
I HAD TO.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
AND I TOLD HIM YOU'D
BEEN AFTER ME EVER SINCE
TO CONTINUE THE AFFAIR,
TO SAY I WAS WITH YOU
WHEN I WASN'T.
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER
WAY TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU,
I'M GOING TO THE POLICE.
WELL,
YOU DO WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO...
AND I'LL DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
GOODBYE.
IT WAS HIM, WASN'T IT?
THE REDHEAD?
LET GO OF ME, PLEASE.
YOU WERE SURE,
WEREN'T YOU,
RIGHT
FROM THE BEGINNING?
YOU WERE SURE
IT WAS HENDERSON.
ALL RIGHT.
I WAS SURE!
OF COURSE
I WAS SURE.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY EYES.
THE ACT
IS ALMOST OVER.
IT WOULD BE
BETTER TO WAIT.
OF COURSE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH!
MMM MMM MMM!
AH!
AH... AH...
SYLVIA!
YOU BASTARD!
GRAB HIM!
HE STABBED MY WIFE!
UNH!
GET HIM!
AAH!
OH! OH, GOD!
AAH!
HE KILLED MY WIFE!
STOP HIM!
AAH!
CALL THE POLICE!
AAH!
AAH!
GET HIM!
GET HIM!
AAH!
AAH!
HE'S THE KILLER!
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK HERE.
HEY! SECURITY!
GET SECURITY!
YEAH...
THE BACK DOOR.
TONIGHT THE BALTIMORE
SOCIAL COMMUNITY IS SHOCKED
OVER THE MURDER
OF ONE OF ITS OWN.
BUT POLICE REFUSE
TO SPECULATE
HERE AT THE TOWNSEND
THEATER IS CONNECTED
TO THE SO-CALLED
DUMPSTER MURDERS.
AN EMPLOYEE OF
THE DEAD WOMAN'S HUSBAND,
COLLIN WENTWORTH,
WAS A WITNESS
TO AN EARLIER
RELATED ASSAULT.
POLICE ARE SEEKING HIM
FOR QUESTIONING.
THANK YOU, CRAIG, FOR
THAT LIVE MINICAM REPORT.
HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN
SWARMED ABOARD THE TALL SHIP...
DENISE...
OH!
OH! OW!
DENISE!
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
WELL,
HERE IT IS.
GOOD NIGHT.
YEAH.
THANKS, PETER.
GOOD NIGHT.
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?
I'LL TELL THEM EVERYTHING AND
TRY TO GET THEM TO BELIEVE ME.
YOU'D SEEN US TOGETHER.
YOU SAW SYLVIA
AT THE TRIAL.
WHY SHOULDN'T SHE BE
AT THE TRIAL?
BUT DENISE, YOU KNOW
SHE WAS THE REAL WITNESS.
I CAN SAY I THINK THAT.
I CAN'T PROVE IT.
THOSE PEOPLE
AT THE TOWNSEND THEATER
WILL SAY THEY THINK
YOU KILLED HER.
I LED HIM
STRAIGHT TO HER.
I KNEW I WAS BEING FOLLOWED,
BUT NOT THAT IT WAS HENDERSON.
AND HE COULDN'T
HAVE PLANNED IT BETTER.
HE GOT RID OF THE ONE PERSON
THAT COULD IMPLICATE HIM
AND THE ONE PERSON
THAT COULD CLEAR ME.
SO NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE I WAS TRYING
TO SHIFT THE BLAME
FROM THE BEGINNING.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
WANT A BEER?
YEAH.
TELL ME
SOMETHING.
YOU DIDN'T SUSPECT ME
LIKE THE POLICE. WHY?
I KNEW SOMETHING
THE POLICE DIDN'T.
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
WE MET? THE LINE-UP?
HOW COULD I FORGET?
I KNEW SOMETHING
WAS WRONG EVEN THEN.
IT WAS OBVIOUS YOU'D
NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE,
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW
OR ANYPLACE ELSE,
AND YOU WERE COMPLETELY
INDIFFERENT TO WHAT YOU DID SEE.
NOT FLATTERING, PERHAPS, BUT
UPON REFLECTION, TRUSTWORTHY.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED
IN FUCKING ME,
AND YOU CERTAINLY WEREN'T
INTERESTED IN KILLING ME.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED,
PERIOD.
HE'LL DO IT AGAIN,
YOU KNOW.
KILL SOME GIRL,
OR TRY TO.
I'LL BE SAFE IN JAIL.
THE PERFECT ALIBI.
I WONDER WHAT
SETS HIM OFF.
BETWEEN THE 2 OF US, WE KNOW
MORE ABOUT IT THAN ANYBODY.
YOU WERE THERE
THAT NIGHT AT THE BAR
WHEN HE PICKED OUT
THAT SORORITY GIRL.
THE NIGHT HE ATTACKED ME, I
DON'T REMEMBER HIM AT THE BAR,
BUT HE WAS PROBABLY THERE
WATCHING ME.
DO WE LOOK ALIKE AT ALL,
THAT OTHER GIRL AND ME?
NOT REALLY.
WHAT MADE HIM
SINGLE HER OUT?
WHAT MADE HIM
NOTICE HER IN PARTICULAR?
WELL, EVERYBODY
NOTICED HER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, SHE DANCED.
DANCED...
TO A RECORD?
WITH HER FRIENDS CHEERING HER ON.
SHE WAS SEXY.
YOU DIDN'T DANCE FOR
HIM, DID YOU?
SURE. ON A THURSDAY NIGHT,
THE PLACE IS PACKED.
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO BREATHE.
DID ANYTHING UNUSUAL
HAPPEN THAT NIGHT?
IT WAS PETER'S BIRTHDAY.
PETER?
I REMEMBER, BECAUSE THE NEXT
DAY, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED,
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN
HIM THE PRESENT HE WISHED FOR...
HE WANTED ME
TO GO HOME WITH HIM.
WHAT HAPPENED
THAT WAS SO UNUSUAL?
AT MIDNIGHT...
WE'D GOTTEN HIM A CAKE...
AND AT MIDNIGHT, C.C.
AND I BROUGHT IT OUT.
Okay, YOU GUYS!
THIS ONE'S FOR PETER!
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
DEAR PETER ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
YAY!
PETER MADE A WISH
AND BLEW OUT ALL THE CANDLES.
AND THEN I KISSED HIM.
YES, I KISSED HIM,
AND SO I KISSED HIM AGAIN,
AND THEY CHEERED EVEN LOUDER.
WHOA!
THEN HE KISSED ME.
I MEAN HE REALLY
KISSED ME,
AND EVERYBODY
WENT CRAZY.
BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER
HIM THERE, HENDERSON?
AT THAT OTHER BAR, EITHER,
THE ONE WHERE YOU SAW HIM.
ANOTHER BEER?
YEAH.
TWO VICTIMS.
BOTH YOUNG, BOTH PRETTY.
BOTH WERE IN BARS WHERE THEY
COULD BE WATCHED BY HIM,
AND BOTH DID SOMETHING THAT MADE
THEM THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.
MAYBE HE GETS EXCITED,
TOO, BUT HE WANTS TO KILL.
WHAT A GUY.
WHAT CAN I DO? I'LL TAKE MY
CHANCES WITH THE POLICE.
DO YOU KNOW
ANY LAWYERS?
YEAH, A GUY I USED
TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH.
I THOUGHT
I'D GIVE HIM A CALL.
IT MIGHT BE BETTER
TO GO IN WITH SOMEBODY.
YOU CAN STAY HERE
TONIGHT IF YOU WANT...
ON THE COUCH.
CALL HIM
IN THE MORNING.
DID YOU LOVE HER?
SYLVIA?
LOVE...
I DIDN'T REALLY EVEN
KNOW HER, AS WE'VE SEEN.
I WAS JUST SOMETHING
FOR HER TO DO.
I CAN THINK OF
WORSE THINGS TO DO.
HERE.
YOU'RE AWAKE.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
ABOUT 4:30.
LISTEN... WHY DON'T YOU
COME INTO MY ROOM?
I'D LIKE YOU TO.
I FIND YOU ATTRACTIVE.
I MEAN,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT IS TRUE, BUT...
THAT'S NOT
THE REAL REASON.
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT,
I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO...
TO DO CERTAIN THINGS.
TONIGHT,
I THINK I COULD,
I MEAN,
IF YOU... WANT TO.
COME HERE.
COME HERE.
THERE'S A BED IN THERE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS?
NOTHING, I GUESS.
TERRY? COME HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WAIT A SECOND.
THINGS ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING
BETTER TO ME THIS MORNING.
ME, TOO.
I WAS THINKING.
ABOUT IT BEING ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME WITH HENDERSON,
AND SOONER OR LATER,
HE'LL KILL AGAIN? YEAH.
AND THAT WOULD CLEAR UP
YOUR PROBLEM?
IT COULD HAPPEN SOONER
INSTEAD OF LATER,
WITH A LITTLE HELP.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THINK ABOUT IT.
SOME GIRL WHO COULD
INADVERTENTLY PUSH HIS BUTTONS.
THAT COULD TAKE
A LONG TIME.
WHAT IF SOME GIRL WHO
KNEW WHAT BUTTONS TO PUSH
DELIBERATELY
SET ABOUT PUSHING THEM?
A GIRL WHO WAS HIS TYPE?
FORGET IT.
WHY?
I WON'T LET YOU.
WHY?
IT'S DANGEROUS.
NOT IF YOU HELP.
WE WON'T LET IT BE.
NO. I SAID FORGET IT.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.
IT'S NO MORE
THAN YOU DID FOR HER.
THAT I WAS EITHER A
ROMANTIC FOOL OR AN IDIOT.
I WAS PROBABLY BOTH.
YOU KNOW, IF I WANT TO
AHEAD, YOU COULDN'T STOP ME.
YOU'D BE IN CUSTODY,
REMEMBER?
BUT I DO HAVE MY OWN REASONS
FOR WANTING HIM CAUGHT.
HE ASSAULTED ME.
IF I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SERIOUS...
IT WOULD NEVER WORK. HE
WOULDN'T GO FOR YOU AGAIN.
HE'D KNOW
IT WAS A TRAP.
NOT IF HE DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE ME.
YOU JUST DON'T THINK
I'M SEXY ENOUGH
TO MAKE HIM TRY.
WHY WOULDN'T HE
RECOGNIZE YOU?
BECAUSE, TERRY,
I'M A WOMAN,
IN CASE YOU STILL
HAVEN'T NOTICED.
HOW DO I LOOK?
UH, DETECTIVE QUIRKE,
IT'S TERRY LAMBERT.
NEVER MIND THAT NOW.
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
UH, I WANT TO
GIVE MYSELF UP.
I DO,
BUT JUST TO YOU...
AND DETECTIVE JESSUP.
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO DO.
NO, NOT NOW. TONIGHT.
LOOK, ONE MORE DAY
WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
LOOK, JUST BE
AT THIS NUMBER AFTER 10:00.
I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT IT THEN.
JUST BE THERE.
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR EYEBROWS?
DYED.
FAKE EYELASHES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YEAH.
YEAH.
WHY WOULD HE HAVE
TO WORK LATE TONIGHT?
WHY NOT?
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T
GO OUT?
WHAT IF HE GOES HOME
AFTER WORK?
THEN THAT'S IT.
I CALL QUIRKE.
LOOK.
NOW, REMEMBER.
STAY BACK A LITTLE.
WATCH ME
IN YOUR REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
I'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
GO...
YOU BETTER HURRY.
GO.
WE DON'T GET SEPARATED,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.
YOU LOSE ME, STOP AND
WAIT FOR ME TO CATCH UP.
BUT BY THEN,
HE'D BE...
WE DON'T GET SEPARATED
NO MATTER WHAT, AGREED?
AGREED!
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON!
NOT ONE OF YOUR BETTER
PLACES IN TOWN.
THERE'S A PHONE BOOTH
RIGHT BACK THERE.
LET'S GO OVER IT
ONE MORE TIME.
I GO IN AND TRY
TO SET THE HOOK.
IF IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
GONNA GO FOR IT...
I CALL QUIRKE,
TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENING,
TO GET OVER TO YOUR PLACE
AND MEET ME THERE.
I DRIVE HOME WITH
HENDERSON FOLLOWING.
IF HE GOES FOR ME,
QUIRKE'S THERE TO SEE IT.
MM-HMM.
