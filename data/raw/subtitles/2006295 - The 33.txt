Mario!
Hey, Mario! Hey, hey!
Great party, Mario.
Lobos! Pass me the ball!
Okay, Escarlette, Escarlette!
Right here, on the left! Come on!
Lobos, over here! Over here, over here!
Yeah!
Well done, Escarlette!
That's my baby, that's my baby.
Mario!
I love your bottom, Katty.
Did I ever tell you that?
You have the best bottom in Copiapó.
You're crazy!
- Hey, Mario.
- Hey, Manuel.
Come on, Copiapó!
Lucho.
Tomorrow is my free day, but...
I would like to work.
- I'm kind of short of money.
- Tomorrow?
I know there is a lot of people
asking you for the same thing, but...
You got it.
That's it? You're not going
to fight me or anything?
I'm not going to fight you.
Thank you very much, Copiapó!
Hola, Jessi.
Hello, Don Jose.
Álex, I found a job for you.
Rodrigo's going to be looking
for some help in the body shop.
We talked about this last time.
What's he going to pay, Dad?
50 a week?
You love birds get the sonogram yet?
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.
It's a boy. It's a boy.
Álex, talk to him.
Okay.
Rodrigo, how are you, man?
- You talked to your old man?
- Yeah.
- How much you going to pay?
- 50 a week.
- 50 a week.
- You're going to have a baby.
Get your ass out of that mine.
Someone fill this old man's glass.
Mario Gómez!
Congratulations on your retirement.
45 years a miner.
- The bravest man I ever met.
- Gómez!
- 46!
- 46.
Empanadas!
Cheese, chicken, pino meat!
Empanadas!
Cheese, chicken, pino meat!
- Good morning, María.
- Empanadas!
Darío.
I know you're not sleeping,
little brother.
I don't care if you don't eat them.
I'll always be here.
They're still warm.
Cheese, chicken, pino meat!
Empanadas!
Yonni, the bus is here!
What's she doing here, Yonni?
You live with me now.
I'm his wife, you bitch.
- Why do you do this to yourself?
- I made your breakfast.
- I know.
- You made him breakfast?
She made breakfast, that's what she does.
Marta, I didn't say I didn't want it.
Guys, guys!
Here comes Don Giovanni.
Check this out. All right.
We have to find a solution to this.
Oh!
Okay, okay!
- Ándale.
- Okay!
Hey, Mario.
You couldn't find a mistress
who lives on the other side of town?
Admit it, you're jealous.
Uh... Believe me, I am not.
Nah.
I love you!
Not dead yet, Segovia?
Not yet, Pastor.
Getting there.
Bolivian!
Loser!
I found this on level three.
So?
We put these mirrors in the cracks
so we know when the mountain shifts.
She's an old mine.
The mountain is going to shift.
The mirrors are going to break.
I think we should get
a health check on the ramp.
- We may be looking at...
- The ramp is a good rock.
The mine's got another
20 years left in her.
We may be looking at a weakness
in the mountain's internal structure.
Marco.
It's my job to keep these men safe.
Correction.
Your job, Lucho,
is to keep these men
pulling out 250 tons a day.
250?
Your quota has gone up.
There's only so much gold in the mountain.
Darío.
All right, guys, we're working
rock bottom today.
Where is Carlos Mamani?
- Here.
- Everyone!
Say hello to Mamani,
our new boy from Bolivia.
He's a tin digger.
What does a tin digger from Bolivia
know about mining for gold?
Elvis, not today, huh?
I got him.
Retirement papers, Gómez!
Two weeks, and you're a free man!
Sign them and get them back to me.
Bravo, Gómez!
Lobos, let's go!
Is that the only way in?
The only way in, the only way out.
You know Elvis didn't
write his own lyrics, right?
That's blasphemy.
Next you're going to tell me
he didn't do his own dancing.
How much longer?
About an hour.
- Whoa.
- Easy, Lobos.
Okay, huevónes. You know what to do.
You should get it together. Darío.
Yonni, what's that?
Bolivia! Hey, Bolivia!
- Kananni, Kachani... What's your name?
- Mamani.
Whatever, come over here.
I know, I know. That's crazy Elvis.
He's just always looking for trouble.
He actually thinks he's Elvis.
Rodrigo has offered me
a job in his body shop.
50 a week. What do you think about that?
50 a week? That's a joke, right?
And you're going to be a father?
That's the problem.
You know what?
You're asking the wrong man.
And I have a terrible hangover.
I don't know, it's the same thing
over and over with my dad.
What was that?
This is why we're here.
Yeah, I can taste it.
Copper and gold. 1,200 an ounce.
Take it. Take it. Yeah.
Cholo, you going to stick that
in your pocket for your mamá?
What did you say?
Everyone knows that Bolivians
are a bunch of thieves.
He's stupid, you know that?
Chile stole this land.
After the War of 1881.
Who are the thieves?
That was... 1881, you know?
Run now! Run!
What the hell?
Oh!
Darío!
Álex, pull me up!
Pull me up! Álex, don't let me fall!
- Álex, don't let me fall! Pull me up!
- Hang on, Darío.
Collapse! Collapse!
Lobos! The carrier!
Gómez, come on!
Get on, get on!
Hurry up! Let's go!
Come on, man!
Darío! Climb, Darío!
Run!
Go!
Move it, move it!
Out! Out! Let's go, everyone!
Come on, Henríquez, let's go!
- Come on!
- Get on! Get on!
Come on, get up!
Everyone hold on!
Lobos! Come on, let's go!
Come on, come on!
- Go up!
- No, don't go up!
No, it's coming from above!
Head down to the refuge!
Head down!
Head to the pick-up!
Hey! Wait for us! Yonni!
- Come on!
- Hurry! Let's go!
- Everyone in?
- Start it!
Up, up, let's go up!
Drive! Out, out, out!
Run, come on!
Go!
- Wait! Lucho!
- Hold on!
Hey!
Lobos! Slow down, slow down!
- Mario!
- Lucho!
Mario, get on!
- Help him up!
- Mario, go!
Get on, Elvis!
Bolivian!
They're in! Go, go!
Come on, man!
The Bolivian fell down!
- Stop!
- Lobos, stop!
Lucho! Stop! Stop!
What is that?
Bolivian, come on!
- Come on!
- Mario!
Come on! Run, run, run!
Come on! Run, damn it!
I got you!
Oh, shit.
Go!
Go!
Are we past it?
I hope so.
It's okay. It's okay.
We're going to be okay, guys.
Go back! It's coming from above!
- The wrong way!
- Go to the refuge! Head down!
Yonni! Turn around!
Look out!
Stop! Stop!
No, no!
Go, go, go!
Oh, God!
Gómez.
Gómez!
Álex!
Álex!
You all right?
Come here. Help me out. Quick.
Stay with him.
- You okay, Gómez?
- Yeah.
- Let's get you up.
- Pastor?
Where's the pastor?
Henríquez.
Okay.
Pull!
Elvis.
You okay, man?
Guys.
You have to see this.
Oh, my God.
That's a big rock.
That's not a rock.
That's the heart of the mountain.
She finally broke.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I got my people checking it out now, yes.
We'll keep it contained.
I'll make sure no one leaves.
Come on! Let's go!
Hey, José, there's been
a collapse in the mine.
They're locking us down.
I'm calling the news.
Nobody out!
Wait, Don José!
Stay here. I'll call you later.
No! I'm coming with you! No!
Hello?
What?
A serious accident just occurred
at the San Jose Mine
40 minutes outside Copiapó.
The number of miners trapped inside
has yet to be determined,
but the company estimates that
30 men were working below.
29...
30...
31, 32...
33.
We're all here.
I thank God for that.
The refuge is built for 30.
So... We're okay.
What do you mean?
What do you mean "we're okay"?
The ramp is blocked, Mario.
There's no road. We have no way out.
What about the chimneys?
- There's ladders there.
- Too dangerous.
I am not ready to sit down there
in the refuge and wait for help.
Mario.
My job is simple.
I have a duty to the safety of these men.
At this moment,
the refuge is the safest place.
There's a radio.
There's food.
Some of these guys need patching up.
You know me, Lucho.
There is no way out
until there is no way out.
I'm going to check out those ladders.
Don Luis. Excuse me.
I'm coming with you.
All right, come on. Bolivian!
We should make a lot of noise.
Burn tires, bang on pipes.
Make a big racket. You never know.
What are they doing?
We have to wait.
It's okay.
Hey, talk to us!
Five hours we've been here!
We told you already.
The company has the situation
under control.
Get Castillo here!
Get off your bony ass...
Okay! Everybody, shut up!
Or I'll have you removed!
Now, go home and wait to be contacted!
Who threw that?
I did.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Get off the property!
And you, too! All of you! Go!
Get out of here!
Go home!
Come on!
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
Hey, where are you all going? Come back.
No, please.
We have to stand our ground.
We have to stay put.
What do you want us to do, María?
They have not told us anything!
That's because they're hiding something.
And there's a reason for that!
We have to stand our ground.
We have to stay put.
Where are the rescue teams?
Huh?
Where are the rescue teams?
Where are the drills?
Why isn't anybody doing anything?
My brother is down there!
We're not going anywhere.
We have to stay here.
- She's right!
- We want to stay!
Hey! Put that down! Put that down!
- Get used to it!
- Stop that!
We're not going anywhere!
- This is a private mine?
- Yes, sir.
Bohn and Kemeny. Chilean nationals.
Thirty-three men trapped underground.
And we don't even know if they're alive?
The responsibility rests
with Bohn and Kemeny.
The government has no obligation
to take a position.
We should have no position on this.
- What are they doing about it?
- Nothing.
They don't have the capability.
I think the government
should show its face.
I'd like to go up there
and take a look at it, sir.
You've never set foot in a mine, Laurence.
What makes you think
you can make any difference?
You've been in the job for what?
Four months.
If we don't react, if we bury our heads,
we look like we don't care.
That's bad for the industry
and that's bad for Chile.
With all due respect, sir,
it's not about us.
I believe we have a moral responsibility.
Thirty-three lives is
a lot of dead people.
Keep going.
Stop!
Come on, Álex.
Someone has to hear.
Lobos. You're wasting your time.
No one is going to hear us.
No one is going to help us.
Hello, this is Luis Urzúa.
I'll check first aid.
Hello, this is Luis Urzúa.
Can you hear me?
Hello, this is Luis Urzúa.
Can you hear me?
Oh, shit.
What?
There's no more ladder.
What do you mean "there's no more ladder"?
I'm telling you, it's not here.
No, no.
No. No.
Moving on.
Álex.
Let's go back.
Okay.
Okay.
Damn it.
No! Álex!
Hold on!
I can't hold on!
- Mario!
- Hold on!
Our Father, who art in Heaven...
Lord Jesus Christ...
You, who are the son of our Creator...
We ask you to grant us
strength and fortitude
in our tribulation.
We ask you today
to protect our families.
It's the government. Hurry up.
Can you please let me through?
We want answers.
That's why I'm here, madam.
But I can't give you answers
unless you let me in.
Or I can have them remove you.
Go ahead and try it.
If you want a little riot on TV tonight.
You're from the government, right?
Laurence Golborne. Minister of Mining.
There are a lot of unhappy
people out here, Laurence.
It's been two days,
and no one has told us anything!
We all know how this goes.
The government shows up,
some good-looking guy in a suit
tells us how much they care.
How much they're going to stop at nothing
to save them, and they do nothing!
We're not going to stand for it, Laurence.
I want you to promise me
you'll do something.
I can promise you we're going
to do everything we can.
Okay?
Okay, go ahead.
- Move, let them through.
- Thank you.
We want answers!
We want answers!
We want answers!
Let's say they are alive.
How long do they have?
Assuming they're alive
and they make it to the refuge,
there's enough food and water
for three days.
And what attempts have been
made to reach them?
I sent a crew of my men down.
A couple of them were almost killed.
So what can we do next, Mr. Castillo?
Nothing.
Well, what's protocol, then?
Protocol?
This mountain is still moving.
I've been a miner for 25 years!
I've seen 5 collapses!
You know how many men we saved?
No one!
Minister, can you tell us anything?
Yes.
The government is assessing the situation.
Are they alive? Do you know?
What did they tell you?
The mine is extremely unstable.
And dangerous for rescuers.
Therefore,
we have to suspend any further
rescue attempts for the moment.
You promised!
Grab the Minister!
You liar!
Close the gates!
It's not right!
You're abandoning us!
Stand over here, sir.
You promised!
- Please! He's my dad!
- My husband's down there!
Please step back.
Help us!
Lunchtime.
I think we should wait for everyone.
Why?
- I'm hungry.
- Darío.
This food is for an emergency.
- So, what is this, Yonni? A picnic?
- Take it easy.
I'm going to eat, Yonni. Come on.
- Darío... Use your head.
- I want you to move.
- Darío! Hey!
- Move!
Come on!
Look at this crap.
Works for me.
You knew, didn't you?
You knew they never finished the ladders.
You knew this place was a deathtrap
but you let us come down anyway, Lucho.
Listen.
I asked Castillo about the ladders.
I asked him again and again.
He had the certification!
Don Lucho!
What is going on there?
Don Lucho!
Give it back!
Don Lucho! Look at this!
Give me the key.
Give me the key!
You took the food!
What are you doing, Darío?
- Having lunch.
- Oh, having lunch?
You're having lunch?
- This is my food.
- Relax! Stop it!
Back off!
Stop it! Stop it!
Calm down!
It's just some cookies.
What's the big deal?
"What's the big deal?"
Let me tell you.
- There is no ladders to climb.
- Yeah.
And the chimneys just caved in.
What?
And there is a huge rock
blocking our only way out of here.
Guys.
We are buried alive.
That is the big deal.
This is all the food we have left
to keep us alive.
We have to ration it carefully!
If we plan on surviving down here
until we are rescued!
Rescued?
Do you hear any drills?
That's because
they're not drilling for us.
We're too far down.
It took 100 years for them
to dig this deep.
How long do you think
that's going to take?
Do you think the owners are going to
spend that kind of money?
They didn't even finish the ladders!
They'll wait three days,
then close the mine
and put up the gravestones.
No.
No, no, no, no!
I don't believe that!
They'll dig us out!
And if they don't, our families will!
With their bare hands, if it's necessary!
I believe we'll make it out of here
because I choose to believe it!
All 33 of us.
You, Lucho, you believe whatever you want.
It's your problem.
Yep.
Yeah. That's the way.
That rescue better get here pretty quick.
Yep. Give me.
There's 18 cans of tuna.
165 grams a can.
Thirty-three men, that's 90 grams a man.
That's half a can.
A little more for the rest of your lives.
Anybody else?
Thank you. Come on.
Hey.
Thank you.
- Mario.
- Give me.
Early today, the mining
company's rescue team
made an attempt to enter the mine.
Through the ventilation chimneys.
But, a secondary collapse
blocked off any possible access to it.
The mining company has now
relinquished control.
Are you watching this?
The Chilean government is
taking over this operation.
Of course.
I need you up there, Sougarret.
As soon as possible.
Golborne is going to need help.
Everyone I speak to says
you're the best in the business.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I appreciate that.
And you appreciate
that we can't afford to fall on our asses
in front of the whole country.
Which one of you is Laurence Golborne?
Can I help you?
Sougarret. Andre Sougarret.
I'm your new chief engineer.
Says who?
The President.
Now, assuming they're alive,
we got 33 men down there.
They are running out of food and water.
But there is adequate air.
We know that they can survive for a period
of time if they are relatively healthy,
but we don't know that.
Some of them could be injured.
Some of them are in the early
or later stages of silicosis.
Miner's lung disease.
What I do know, is that
if we don't get them up fast,
we're going to be bringing up 33 corpses.
Here's what we know.
The men were working in the lower half
of the mine when it collapsed.
That puts them here, at the refuge.
A 5 meter-wide space 200 stories down.
My readings indicate
that a massive rock displaced itself here.
We're talking about
700,000 tons of diorite.
Or twice the mass
of the Empire State Building.
Obviously,
we can't go in through the front door,
so to speak.
So we're going to have to drill.
Best case scenario,
we reach them in eight days.
Eight days?
They're too far down, too deep.
Eight days?
But that's not the biggest problem.
It's the deviation factor.
Look. Here's the refuge.
If you run these drills 24 hours a day
at full speed,
the drill is going to deviate, like this.
Or like this.
In fact, it can bend 20 different ways.
And even if everything goes
according to plan,
the odds are still going to be against us.
What exactly are you saying?
What I'm saying, Minister,
is that there's a less than
1 % chance of finding them.
I need every drill that you
can get your hands on.
And I want them here as soon as possible.
- Mario.
- Yeah.
This one has less.
- Which one?
- This one.
- Is everybody happy?
- Yeah.
All right, ladies.
Next meal in 24 hours.
How are we supposed to survive on this?
If we get hungry,
we can always eat the Bolivian.
I heard Bolivians taste like chicken.
Look! Look!
They're bringing drills!
The drills are here!
We did it.
Okay.
Twist it. Twist all those wires together.
There will be light.
You cannot live without light.
Tell me, Álex...
Why do you think having a boy
is so much better than having a girl?
Yonni, what is it about a guy like you?
Face like a horse's ass,
nappy hair, bad breath,
you fart in your sleep.
How come the ladies love you so much?
There's 33 guys down here
and I'm the only one
who has a little something going on,
on the side?
No, not in the house
across the street, man!
At least close the curtains!
She doesn't have curtains!
Elvis is in the building.
Shh!
You hear that?
It's a drill.
They're looking for us.
Is that not the sweetest sound
you've ever heard?
The job is so much more
complicated than I thought.
I really want to be there
for Ivy's birthday.
Tell the girls I miss them so much.
Stop, stop!
Look, I've got to call you back.
What happened?
Sougarret! What happened?
You see this diorite?
Twice as hard as granite.
This is the problem.
We're going to need new drills.
Okay, I can get you more drills, but
- we're running out of time.
- I know.
Why are you burning
through them so quickly?
Listen, I don't have six months
to explain to you
the complex geology
of the Atacama Desert...
- That's not what I asked...
- You want to be a miner?
Get a book, read the basics.
Start with orogenesis.
I got 33 men down there
I've got to worry about.
You do what you need to do.
Be a suit, go talk to the media.
Let me do my job.
Why is it taking so much time?
I know you're all growing restless.
I know you want answers.
But I'm here to assure you that we
are doing everything we possibly can
to make contact with your loved ones.
We need to know if they're alive.
I don't have a definitive
answer right now.
That's the truth.
We have 10 drills working 24 hours a day.
Look, I know how you must feel.
I'm going to expand accommodations
for your families.
I'm setting up a commissary,
a medical facility,
and a temporary school for your children.
That's all for now.
Minister!
We know the mine is very dangerous.
It can collapse in any moment. Minister!
Hey, Minister of Mining.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to slap you.
I'm not saying
I'm never going to slap you.
You kept your word.
What's your name?
María Segovia.
Darío's wife.
Sister.
He's my kid brother.
I'm not leaving without him.
They're everywhere!
Please get them off me!
Get them off me! They're everywhere!
I need a drink! Oh, God!
Darío.
I'm dying. I'm dying.
We're all dying. We're all going to die.
It's okay.
There's a lot worse things
in life than death.
How come you have time for me? Huh?
Why don't you hate me like everybody else?
Why? Why?
Hate
is for children.
If we can just be good to each other,
we might find
a way out of here.
We can say a prayer together, if you like.
I don't know the words.
God doesn't care.
Merciful Father.
Merciful Father.
Take
this boy.
Open his eyes.
So he can see.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.
María, where to?
This way, please.
- Yes, Mayor.
- Good, good, good.
Okay, we're going to school.
Single-file, please.
File in behind me, please.
That one.
- Thank you, Susi.
- Enjoy. Nice to see you.
Excuse me.
What's your name?
What's she been saying?
- What are you doing, Marta?
- Her name is Susana Valenzuela.
- Don't do this. Marta!
- She's my husband's mistress.
Sorry, Susana, but only family members
are permitted inside the fence.
No putas allowed, sorry.
But I am his family.
I love him, and he loves me too!
He loves you?
- Take her stuff.
- You can throw me out, but I'll be back.
And when Yonni comes up,
and he will come up,
we'll see who he loves best!
What is this?
Food and water is low.
We have to make it last.
One tablespoon of tuna every other day,
and a shot of water once a day.
That's it.
I ran it through a filter I made.
It sucks, but it's just
about drinkable, okay?
Álex.
Do yourself a favor.
Yeah?
If we get out of here,
find yourself a new line of work.
Shut up, Gómez.
Shut up!
We're getting close.
Adding the last pipe section.
How many sections?
We got five left.
- Okay.
- We need to set it.
It's a little tight.
We're getting extremely close, sir.
Six!
We're down to the last 6 meters.
Five meters!
Four!
Yeah!
We need to mark it!
Yonni! Get some paint!
When the drill comes through,
we all have to make a lot of noise!
- Write a note!
- I've got it!
What? What happened? Mario?
It's below us.
The thing's below us.
At least they are looking
in the right place.
You still don't get it yet, do you?
It took them this long to get that close!
They're not going to look
for us forever, Mario.
We're starving, Mario!
When they get back, we will be dead!
Álex.
Álex!
Hey!
Hey!
I've been a miner all my life.
I let you down!
I let myself down.
I knew this place was dangerous!
We all knew about this place!
Nobody's blaming you!
You want to blame somebody?
Blame Castillo, blame the owners!
Where is Álex?
Nothing.
It's the deviation, Laurence.
We can't figure it out.
We missed by 10 meters.
That's 100 years of piss and shit
down there.
Álex!
If you really want to do this,
don't do it alone.
- Are you crazy?
- No, let's do it together.
Yes, I am crazy! I am crazy!
I am completely out of my mind.
But you know what?
I have a daughter.
And a wife.
And you have a wife
with a baby on the way,
and they're counting on you, Álex.
My baby.
We need you, man.
I need you.
We've already burnt through nine drills.
This...
This is becoming an impossible situation.
Sometimes impossible situations
can take a little longer.
Laurence, our guys are already
in acute starvation.
If they are even alive.
I think we've got to start asking
ourselves the really tough questions.
How long do you think we can keep this up?
Hmm?
What's going on here?
They know the rule. No families allowed.
It's Don Francisco.
Shit!
God damn it, Mamani!
You scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing here?
The same as you.
What's with the knife?
Are you going to cut me up and eat me?
They say Chileans taste like chicken.
Maybe you've noticed...
I don't have a lot of friends down here.
Where's your head lamp?
I never got one.
Here.
Listen, Mamani, uh...
Nobody is eating anybody while I am here.
Did you get that?
I'm so scared.
I don't want her growing up
without a father.
Tell me it's going to be okay.
- Just say it...
- I can't.
Just tell me that it's going to be okay.
Jessi, stop it.
You know it as well as I do
that it's not gonna be okay.
I have been wanting to say something.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry that I have
stolen from you guys.
I just hope that one day
you can forgive me.
I have been saving these for you.
I just wish I had a box
of them to give you.
Thank you, Darío.
Thank you from all of us.
What I wouldn't do for
one of your sister's empanadas right now.
Bless this food. Amen.
Mmm.
Jessi.
Oh, my God.
Baby.
Katty.
It's gonna be okay.
Mom, what are you doing here?
Look how skinny you are.
Yonni, eat.
Charquicán.
Your favorite. Excuse me.
Fresh milk.
Anyone?
I just...
I just want you to know
that...
I couldn't be prouder than I am
to share with you this last meal.
With all of you.
If that is the case,
if this is our last supper,
I am officially handing in
my retirement papers.
I quit!
You called it off.
It wasn't my decision.
And this?
A memorial?
A poem for the gravestones,
a few words by Pablo Neruda.
That has nothing to do with me.
This is bullshit. Look.
Those people out there are counting on us.
On you and me.
Thirty-three men underground.
Three hundred mothers, fathers,
brothers, sisters,
and we are their only hope.
Snap out of it, Laurence.
It's a false hope.
- And you're giving up!
- Three days' food?
That's all they had.
They are down there for 16 days.
You are giving these families false hope.
They can survive 40 days without food.
Not under those conditions, Laurence.
It's 100 degrees down there.
Do you know what that's like?
It's a tomb!
I understand how you feel.
I feel the same.
I know that your heart is
in the right place.
- And where's yours?
- It's not about you!
It's over!
It's over, Laurence.
I have something for you.
Hi.
It's the best empanada in town.
Mmm.
I mean well.
I do.
I say everything I think.
That's my trouble.
I aim to please.
Somehow I...
I always find a way to miss.
Not by miles,
but I can't seem to learn
from my mistakes.
You have to sleep.
Thank you.
We heard the news, Minister. I'm sorry.
Don't be. No one is dead yet.
Restart the drill.
You got it. You have the azimuth?
Who?
The azimuth. The angle, Minister.
Hey, Laurence.
You need some help?
What's on your mind?
Ground.
Refuge.
Drill.
Look at the direction.
Look how I drew it.
Yes, but I don't get your point.
We learn from our mistakes.
Let the toughness
of the rock be the guide.
Your drill is facing
in the wrong direction.
- Exactly.
- This doesn't make any sense.
Only if you aim to...
Miss.
Are you crazy?
You'll bring the mountain down
on top of these men.
Stop trying to think
like you're some kind of...
Why, yes.
We use the deviational measurement
from our last miss.
And we already know where
the rock is at its most dense.
It's so simple.
Learn from your mistakes.
Aim to miss.
Now you're thinking like a miner.
Keep it going!
20-degree inclination.
- Keep going!
- More.
That's it!
35!
Perfect!
If I have a girl,
I'm gonna call her Esperanza.
Jessi would like that.
Come on, Pastor.
Drink.
Stay with me, Pastor.
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come...
Forgive me, my Lord.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
Drill.
Drill!
Drill!
Hey!
Come here! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Drill!
It's here!
It's here!
Look, look! Look.
Look. Hey! Hey, guys!
Hey!
We're here! We're here!
Shh! I hear something.
Someone's alive.
Shut down the generators.
Could be rock fall.
Stethoscope.
Here.
I have the note.
I have the note!
Okay, stop!
It's been painted.
You sure it wasn't there before?
- Definitely not, sir.
- There's something there.
Where?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
This message comes to us
from the depths of the earth.
From the very hands of our miners.
"We are all well in the refuge.
"The 33."
Viva Chile, mierda!
- Gracias.
- De nada.
Gracias.
Susi!
Marta!
He's alive!
They're safe! They're all safe!
I knew you could do it.
We found them. Now we got to get them out.
Nobody has ever done
anything like this before.
God bless our miners!
God bless them!
It's Luis Urzúa, the supervisor.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
I can hear you.
This is Laurence Golborne,
the Minister of Mining.
How are you?
Seventeen days is a long time,
and after 17 days,
you wouldn't have blamed
rescuers for losing hope.
Until they got the sign, that is,
that 33 miners, all of them,
2,000 feet down, were okay.
The families today get a chance
to do what they do once a week.
They get to meet via video conference
with their loved ones down below
for about 8 minutes.
Three platforms are now in place,
specialized in deep drilling.
The Australian drill, Plan A,
is going directly into
the miners' emergency shelter
which is 2,300 feet below the surface.
Down here is Plan B.
Now, this is a T-130 drill.
That is going to be manned
by the U.S. engineer Jeff Hart.
It's a pretty blunt instrument.
It's like a huge jackhammer.
But it could get through
the ground very quickly.
One guy has a drug problem,
another suffers from depression,
another guy is bipolar.
These men are going to start
killing each other
if they're down there for much longer.
And this is going to go on
for three months at least.
Three months?
- Are you recording?
- Yeah.
Uh...
My name is Mario Sepúlveda.
Welcome to the
San Jose Mine Resort Hilton.
We'll take a look around.
Guys, more palomas coming in!
Nikes.
And iPods for everyone!
Hey, Gómez! Here are your dirty magazines.
- Mario?
- Hi, Dad.
- Can you hear us?
- Can you hear, Dad?
Yeah. Yeah.
How are you? Other than skinny.
- Katty.
- You're so skinny.
Escarlette.
It's okay, Dad.
Here it is.
Couldn't see if it was a boy or a girl.
Let it be a surprise, Álex.
I don't want to know.
As long as you two are good.
That's all that matters.
Dad...
Álex.
I've missed you.
Another one of us.
No, don't, don't...
People don't need to see that.
People don't need to see that.
And the fact that I was
in the military for a while
allowed me just to know
how to organize people.
You are famous, Mario.
Don Francisco was here.
He said last night that you were
the most famous man in Chile.
Don Francisco said that?
We will get you out.
And to see your families by Christmas.
We'll be waiting for you.
Goodbye, and God bless.
- All right, he's gone.
- Christmas?
- Listen, listen.
- That's three months!
No, listen! Listen to me!
Disappointing news from Chile.
The Canadian drill, Plan C,
has been shut down indefinitely
due to unexpected technical difficulties.
The drill and its team,
which the families had high hopes for,
are now headed home.
Have your husband sign them.
And please, if you have
any questions, call me, okay?
I'm going to read them and talk to Mario.
We're talking about
a lot of money.
Katty,
keep it to yourself.
- Farkas!
- Look, it's Farkas!
How are you, how are you?
I'm going to give you enough money so your
husbands don't have to work for a year.
I'm going to give you each $10,000.
Darío.
Darío.
The huge slab of rock,
the so-called "megastone,"
twice the size of the
Empire State Building,
is believed to have shifted
in the last few hours.
It has added yet more urgency to
the rescue effort here, on the surface.
We hit steel.
Most likely a horizontal support.
A beam or something.
Anyway, we busted the bit.
Bitch is stuck down in that
borehole like a dummy.
Let's replace the bit.
No, the piece of bit
is 1,420 feet down there.
We're not drilling until we
get that piece out of there.
However that is.
I'm calling my contacts in Brazil,
get us some big old magnets.
Oh.
Mario, there's no drills.
They're not drilling.
Are you listening to me?
- Okay, that's good.
- Hey, Yonni, listen to this.
"Marta, the wife of miner Yonni Barrios,
"had Yonni's mistress
removed from Camp Hope
"for the third time."
"Susi, Yonni's mistress,
is happy being a home wrecker."
Now the whole world thinks
that Susi is a whore
and that I'm a two-timing scumbag.
Well...
That's not right.
I don't believe this.
Our fearless leader, Super Mario,
who will tell anyone
who is willing to listen
that he is the one solely
responsible for our survival,
has been offered a book deal for
"an undisclosed sum."
Undisclosed sum, huh?
What's the sum, Mario?
Were you planning on
having any of us in this book deal?
- Did you do it?
- Of course he did it.
You know what, "Fearless Leader"?
We're going to get along
just fine without you.
You really think I need you?
Any of you?
You know, the leader
makes sure you don't starve.
The leader keeps the lights on.
No, you had some help with the lights on.
Yes, me.
What are you doing?
- We don't need you!
- You did this, Mario!
We've had enough. Get out.
Get out of here!
The leader never gives up.
You know,
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
I never asked for this.
You gave it to me.
You listen to me, Golborne.
None of your drills are working.
That is unacceptable!
We spent millions of dollars
bringing them down here.
We made no secret of that.
Now you tell me
the American drill is down?
The drill bit fractured in the borehole,
but we have magnets coming in from Brazil.
Heavy-duty magnets...
I don't want to hear about your magnets!
The mine is crumbling!
We're running out of time, Golborne.
There's talk of lawsuits
and criminal charges from the families.
I don't have to tell you
the miners occupy a privileged position
in the affections of the Chilean people.
The last thing we need is these men dying
with the whole world watching!
I don't think it's going too far to say
that the future of this administration
depends on the outcome.
Mr. President, I can...
Darío.
You want to say something to me?
You know María, my sister, right?
Yeah.
I have been mad at her all of my life.
She abandoned me when I was just a kid.
I mean, she was a kid also, and had
already raised my other five siblings.
She just needed her own life.
I couldn't see that before.
I know she's up there,
I know she's waiting for me,
but what am I supposed to say?
What am I supposed to do when we get out?
If we get out.
You hug her
and you cry like a baby.
Forgive her for everything
that she has ever done.
You pray to God that she forgives you.
She's your family.
María is all the family you've got.
Family...
Family is all we have.
That's my iPod.
You're a thieving Bolivian Indian.
- We all got iPods.
- It's my iPod.
- It's not yours.
- Give me my iPod.
- It's not yours!
- Give me my iPod!
It's not yours, Elvis!
Mamani.
Stop!
Kid, look at me! Look at me!
That's the Devil guiding your hand.
Give me that.
You were going to kill a man
over this piece of shit?
For what?
Because some fat cat says
he's gonna give us some money?
Because some whore writes
some gossip about your family life?
Come over here. Come over here.
So what?
So some people wanna break your balls
because you are a Bolivian?
You are a Bolivian.
So, what is that, what is that?
Come on.
What about me?
Calling myself the leader down here.
Throwing my weight around,
thinking, you know,
that I did everything on my own.
No.
No, this is not me.
This is not us.
We all know what is up there.
It's a circus.
So let's not get too far ahead
of ourselves.
No, let's don't do that,
because we are not going
to get anything out of this.
Anything.
We walked in miners and we will walk out
miners.
I didn't sign the book deal.
Was I going to?
Yes.
Did I want to provide for
my family and for my kid?
Yeah. But I didn't.
I didn't. Why?
Because of you.
Because you're my brothers,
and if we want to stay brothers,
we got to pull together
to get out of here.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Welcome back, Mario.
Welcome back.
Here it comes!
I knew it!
Yes!
Back to work!
Vicente! Hey!
Come on, get up.
Let's get ourselves some miners.
We got it out. We're gonna restart.
I figure about 20-40 we're gonna hit 'em.
Hey, Vicente! Hey. Okay, guys.
- Come on, let's go.
- Arriba.
Get some coffee over here.
Come on, son!
Lieutenant.
Take down the fence.
All of it.
Yes, sir.
Come in. Everyone.
Please.
You're coming in too close
to some iron support beams.
If she hits those beams,
that drill is a goner.
We're going to have to clear it
ourselves from down here.
How?
A controlled explosion.
No, no, no, Don Lucho. That's a negative.
The mountain is completely unstable.
You need another option.
We know.
We know it's unstable,
but it's the only way.
We're all ready to get out of here.
Or die trying.
Álex! Mario!
We're going to bolster the beam
with these timbers, here.
The charges will be placed here,
correlating to this.
Jessi.
I'll take you to the hospital.
No, I'm staying right here, Don José.
I'm not leaving Álex.
Susi.
From Yonni.
He wrote me.
- Oh, my God.
- He spoke to the Minister.
You belong at Camp Hope with us.
- I get to come in?
- Yes.
Marta, why are you leaving us?
I decided to leave him.
He doesn't deserve a woman like me.
Besides, he farts in his sleep.
Excuse me.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Carlos Mamani.
Okay?
Are you ladies ready?
Hell of a first day, eh, Bolivian?
Make sure you put in for some overtime.
Come on, baby.
3... 2... 1!
Look!
Here she comes!
All right, we're in.
You did it! Thank you, Jeff.
You're Chile's new national hero.
Decked out in the colors
of the national flag,
this is Fenix 1, the rescue capsule
that Chilean authorities,
along with most of the world,
are now pinning their hopes on.
The metal cage is designed to haul
the 33 miners, one by one,
from 700 meters below ground
to the sunlight they haven't
seen now for 62 days.
Open it up.
Okay.
It's sinking.
How fast?
Too fast.
You see this green line?
We marked this stone yesterday.
You see how far it has come down?
I guess the explosion has done its job.
700,000 tons of rock
sitting just directly over their heads.
It's not a question of if it falls,
but when.
Okay, guys, here's the situation.
We just don't have time
to reinforce the shaft.
If anything happens to the Fenix capsule,
if its mechanism fails
or the walls of the shaft collapse,
I have to tell you
that there is a real possibility
we can't get you guys out.
The guy who goes first
will be in the greatest danger.
But could also be the only one
to make it out.
You decide who that man will be.
Fenix.
Sir?
We're ready for initiation.
- Yeah.
- Go, Álex!
See you old men
up there.
Okay?
Okay.
Get in there.
We are ready.
Sir, they're good to go.
All right.
On the count of 3, begin the ascent.
Beginning ascent in 3, 2...
Come on!
700 meters.
Mr. Vega is looking good.
The capsule is holding steady, 500 meters.
500-meter mark.
Look, his heart rate
is all over the place.
He's nervous. Who wouldn't be?
The mountain is stable.
Everything looks good.
Rate of ascent is within
normal parameters.
400 meters.
300 meters.
Ignacio, what happened?
The capsule is trapped in the borehole
and we lost biometrics.
There's a problem.
Hey!
Hey!
- Stand by.
- It's not moving.
We don't have a visual down here.
I'm gonna try and reverse it.
Don Lucho.
The capsule is stuck.
They're reversing the Fenix.
What happened?
Here we go.
Okay, beginning descent.
Is he breathing?
We have no way of knowing
what his oxygen supply is.
Oh, man.
Hey!
- Shine it down there.
- Anything?
I'm gonna try again.
The wheel has stopped.
Okay, it's moving.
The capsule is moving.
- What happened?
- We lost the feed, we lost Álex.
They've lost contact.
He made it?
He made it!
Dad.
Mijo.
This is your baby girl.
Esperanza.
Oh, my God.
Mario.
Good luck, Mario.
See you soon.
Goodbye, huevónes!
I love you!
I love you!
Yeah, baby! Come on!
I'm coming, Katty!
Minister. Finally I meet you.
- Call me Laurence, Mario.
- Laurence.
Mario! Over here!
Mario! Mario!
Hey, my brothers, thank you!
Thank you for everything!
- Let's go for a "Chi!"
- Chi!
- Let's go for a "le!"
- Le!
Chi, Chi, Chi! Le, le, le!
Viva Chile!
Thank you for never giving up on us!
Thank you for never giving up!
I love you, Copiapó!
Elvis, Elvis!
Yonni! Yonni!
- Susi.
- I love you!
Darío, Darío.
My sister, María Segovia. Do you know her?
Right there. Right there. Come.
Darío, Darío.
Where?
María?
María?
María?
Thank you.
Thank you.
