My name is Tilghman,

I have a little club outside of

So anybody who wants

All right.
People who really want to have a good

It's going to change.
Man, that sure sounds good.
But a lot of the guys who come
in here, we can't handle one on one.
Even two on one.
Don't worry about it.
All you have to do
is follow three simple rules.
One, never
underestimate your opponent.
Expect the unexpected.
Two, take it outside.
Never start
anything inside the bar
unless it's absolutely necessary.
And three,
be nice.
Come on.
If somebody gets in your face and calls
you a cocksucker, I want you to be nice.
Okay.
Ask him to walk.
Be nice.
If he won't walk, walk him.
But be nice.
If you can't walk him,
one of the others will help you,
and you'll both be nice.
I want you to
remember that it's a job.
It's nothing personal.
Uh-huh.
Being called
a cocksucker isn't personal?
No.
It's two nouns combined
to elicit a prescribed response.
What if somebody calls
my mama a whore?
Is she?
(MEN CHUCKLING)
I want you to be nice
until it's time to not be nice.
Well, how are we supposed
to know when that is?
You won't. I'll let you know.
You are the bouncers.
I am the cooler.
All you have to do
is watch my back and each other's

Tells me you said it was
self-defense at the trial.
But you and I know
that isn't so, don't we?
Relax.
Tell me,
if I owned a bar and
wanted to clean it up,
how much would it take
to get you to come work for me?
There's no amount of money.

Ernie, what's the story?
Whiskey's running low.
I finally get this

I've called every supplier I know.
Why won't they deliver?
Wesley.
Ernie, give me the phone.
I'll take care of it.
Hi.
I hear you're

Uh-oh.

Mmm.

You're going to have a lot of
pain when you get older, Dalton.
You could be crippled
if you don't slow down.
Yeah, that's what they say.
You already know that?
No, I just said,
"That's what they say."
(LAUGHS)
Where are you
going to go from here?
I don't know.
You could stay, Dalton,
if you wanted to.
I don't think so.
Hang on!
You got a woman
up there with you?
That's right.
Don't give me no lip, Lord.
Where'd she get to?
She'll be back.
If you're smart,
you'd pitch your tent.
Sometimes I'm not as smart
as I'd like to be.
You never know, son. Maybe she'll
be smart enough for both of you.
Thanks, Ernie.
- Hi, Dal.
- Hi, honey.
Hey, there he is.
- What's up?
- What do you say?
Hey, Cody.
Hey, bro.
What's going down?
Not too much.
That's not what I hear.
The word is, you've been
spending time with Elizabeth Clay.
So?
You know who had a thing
for Elizabeth Clay?
Brad Wesley.
As I hear it,
she left town and he went nuts.
It's a small town.
And I don't...
Dalton!
The truck's here.
Okay.
Of course,
that's just the word.
- Thanks.
- No problem.

Hey!
Put them back.
This bar is closed for business.
It's okay, Jim. Take a break.
Can I buy you guys a drink?

I'll show you one I'm real

A woman?
Boy, was she.
God, I feel like dancing.
You like to dance, Doc?
Yeah.
What time is it?
Daytime.
Good, then some other place
will be open. Let's get out of here.

it's a little more romantic. Let's go.

All right, that's enough.
This isn't working out, Dalton.
Let's go, boys.
Your ass is mine, boy.
Same town, new story, pal.
Let's get a beer.
RED: I've talked till I'm blue
in the face, God damn it.
We could salvage the place, Red.
We could build it back up.
I'll help you out.
Nope.
But you got insurance, don't you?
For 20 years,
I watched Wesley get richer,
while everybody around him
got poorer.
Can you prove he started the fire?
Who you going to prove it to?
He has the sheriff and
the police force in his pocket,
for Christ's sake.
I can call a friend in
Springfield who works for the FBI.
Are you going to
take the stand against him?
There's only one person
around here
you've got to prove anything to.
That's Wesley himself.
You scared him last night.
Brad Wesley, he's not afraid
of anything, right?
Last night, that son
of a bitch was afraid.
No, he wasn't.
Dalton, check this out.
Wesley wants to put
a little something down
on a new car.
You lost your faith, Strodenmire.
That's what it is.
It's made you an abuser.
Well, what are you
waiting for, Gary?
Drive through there!
No! No! No!
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
(ENGINE REVVING)
Oh, my God.
Yeah!
What the hell is
wrong with you, Brad?
Have you lost your mind?
He's a drifter, you know.
To see you wind up
with someone like that is a shame.
This has nothing to do with him.
Well...
You get him out of here, Elizabeth.
Because if you don't,
he's going down.
And I'm not going to lose
a second's sleep about it.
Strodenmire.
I never thought
you'd turn on me, too.
This is my town.
Don't you forget it.
Let's go, Jimmy.
You got insurance, don't you?
Hey, little amigo.
You're all fucked up,
aren't you?
Let's crank that thing up
and head down the road.
We can be gone by dawn.
Never see this place again.
You can leave anytime you want to.
Shit, kid.
Fuck.
You don't need this.
Don't tell me what I need.
If you want to go, go. Get the
fuck out of here and leave me alone.
Yeah, you're right.
I ought to stop
telling you what to do.
Maybe I ought to kick your ass.
(DALTON GRUNTS)
No, we don't want to do this.
And I'll tell you something else.
You taught me as much
as I ever taught you.
I love you, mijo.
I'll see you.
(GRUNTING)
Dalton.
Little late for
a house call, don't you think?
I came to talk to you.
No,
you came to tell me to leave.
I care about you, Dalton.
You don't know him.
Bullshit.
I know exactly
who Brad Wesley is.
I've seen his kind many times.
He keeps taking and taking
until somebody takes him.
It's obvious nobody in this
town can stand up to him.
But you can stop him.
Brad Wesley picked me.
And when he did, he fucked up.
I'm only good at one thing, Doc.
I never lose.
But what are you going to win?
Who's this for anyway?
Are you doing it for them?
I don't think so.
Do you think you're gonna
save these people from Brad Wesley?
Well, who's gonna
save them from you?
(EXPLODING)
Emmet!
Emmet!
Emmet!
It's Dalton.
Are you all right?
I'd be fine if you'd get off of me.
(BIKE ENGINE REVVING)
Prepare to die.
You are such an asshole.

like you in prison.
Damn, boy.
I thought you were good.

Hello.
WESLEY: Top of the morning to you.
Here's what's on for today.
Wade? Or Elizabeth?
What?
One of them dies.
Now, who will it be?
You are a sick man.
Well, I just have to flip a coin.
Hold on a second.
Wesley?
Dalton,
I'd sure like to tell you
how it turned out.
Wesley.
Garrett. Oh, my God.
Over here.
Are you all right?
There was only three of them.
They said I was lucky.
I got to find Doc.
Let's go.
Sit the fuck down.
Have a beer. I'll be back.
Hey.
Wesley wins, man.
We're out of here.
That a boy, mijo.
Where's Dr. Clay?
She's in X-ray.
(DOOR OPENING)
Get your things.
We're out of here.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Yes, you are.
Let's go. Now.
Forget it.
Doc,
the man is crazy.
And you're not?
Now, get out of here.
Yo.
Wake the fuck up.
We're out of here.
I said one beer, senor.
Remember that blonde? Whew.
She could suck-start a Harley.
There he is.
Get out of here!
Find that prick.
O'Connor?
Shit.
Tails again.
I hate this place.
(SCREAMING)
Mr. Wesley!
You're made for each other.
(FLOORBOARD CREAKING)
I see you found
my trophy room, Dalton.
The only thing that's missing
is your ass.
What's this all about, anyway?
Your friend Wade?
One old man?
That's what I call
a mercy killing.
I took him out of his misery.
Now, you're not mad at me
about that, are you?
Hell, you took Jimmy.
He was in better shape.
Hell, you took all my boys.
Now, come on out, Dalton.
This town is big enough
for both of us.
Let's talk about this.
(GUN FIRING)
I thought it would be fun
to fight you.
I really did.
But now,
I just don't have the time.
No!
It's over!

and don't you forget it.

Brad, where are you?
They're in here, Sheriff.
All right, who's gonna tell
me what the hell happened here?
I didn't see nothing.
You see anything, Pete?
No, I didn't see anything.
You see anything, Red?
I didn't see nothing.
Not a thing.
You see anything, Tinker?
