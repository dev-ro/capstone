This story is not necessarily true.
But it is based on real events.
GEORGETOWN
So, you're a first-timer?
Mm-hmm. You?
A veteran. Two earlier dinner
parties and a cocktail reception.
And?
Difficult to describe.
It's always memorable.
Mm.
Eleanor Price.
I'm with Reuters.
Ted Parsons.
Oh! You should have said.
Congratulations.
Yes, indeed.
Thank you.
This is a very big
night for you.
It is.
You must be very happy.
- Well, I'm very relieved.
- Uh-huh.
- And I'm grateful.
- Mm.
How did he do it?
I have no earthly idea.
How do you know Mott?
Everybody in
Georgetown knows Ulrich.
He's made himself indispensable
to us at the embassy.
No, indispensable's
not the right word.
Impossible to ignore.
Think Lawrence of Arabia
with a Blackberry.
The last time I was here,
I sat next to Scalia.
He officiated at their wedding.
Can you imagine?
Have you met his wife?
I didn't know
he was married.
Oh, of course he's married.
This is her house.
Where is Elsa?
Invitation came through DOD.
They sent me.
Never heard of this guy.
What's his deal?
Not sure. Apparently a bit
of a miracle worker.
I've only met him
a couple of times.
- Have you heard the tales from Iraq?
- No.
He sent us reports from
the region for over two years.
Not that we'd asked for them.
Most incredible shit
you've ever seen.
So, finally I was
forced to say, "You're mad.
Take your ridiculous plan,
stick it up your asses."
Diplomatically, of course.
They said, "Ulrich,
you cannot say that
to the head of German
intelligence."
And I said,
"I think I just did."
I mean, come on.
If you're talking about
planting a listening device
in some hotel room somewhere,
in the back of some underling's
car, well, all right.
But Madeleine Albright's
master bath?
Come on! Don't be silly.
Ah, then, you know,
I went home.
Slept on it.
The next day they rang
and made an offer...
How do they say?
That you can't refuse.
What happened?
Well, maybe next time
you're at Madeleine Albright's,
don't have any significant
conversations in her bathroom.
May I invite you?
Thank you.
Oh, pardon me.
Sorry to startle you.
You... You didn't.
She often takes a nap
before dinner.
I've just come to wake her.
Excuse me.
Of course,
he could always hire a caterer,
but he does
everything himself.
Oh, I know.
I apologize
for my late appearance. Hi.
Ulrich promised
he'd wake me earlier.
Yes.
I thought you
needed the rest, madam.
Oh, you see
how he babies me?
You know how I hate
to miss the cocktails.
Well, we all forgive you
if you wish to make up
for lost time.
Ah. Now,
before anything else...
To Ulrich and his
marvelous achievement.
No, no, no, no.
I was just one of many players
in a very complicated game.
It's really the...
Oh, listen,
I'm making the toast.
Oh. Sorry.
And to a woman
and her freedom.
And to all of you
who are celebrating with us.
Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
Mm.
It's very warm.
Now, we're all hungry.
Fetch the soup.
Yes, it is true.
One of our staffers
was arrested in Iran.
She's a lovely lady.
Married.
Daughter just started
kindergarten.
Now, we don't hear from her
for a few days,
and then the word
comes back.
They have grabbed her, and they're
holding her on espionage charges.
She was a spy?
No. We're a research shop.
She's an economist.
It's bullshit. Nevertheless, the State
Department, you wouldn't touch it.
You're too busy
with this transition in Iraq.
We couldn't communicate
with anybody over there.
We're completely helpless,
out of touch.
Meanwhile...
Thank you, Mott.
Meanwhile, this poor woman
is rotting in a jail cell
in Tehran.
And then a friend of mine,
a former ambassador,
refers me to our
illustrious host.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Ted!
I step away for a minute,
you start embarrassing me.
Oh, no, Ulrich.
Let him tell his story.
Well, we met,
and he said he'd take care of it.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
I said I'd look into it.
And?
And...
ten days later, she's released.
Now, he did that.
- Mott did that.
- How?
He still
hasn't told me.
You can't expect a magician
to give away his tricks.
Come on.
- No, no, no, no.
- Mr. Mott...
No, no. Enough.
Enough of that.
- Please, sit.
- What?
Oh, I hope she's
feeling all right.
I-I can't,
I just can't.
I can't listen
to any more of this.
It's the middle
of the dinner.
I don't care about the dinner.
I didn't even know there
was going to be a dinner.
I came here to see you,
Mother.
You told me you wanted
to spend some time together.
We never get to do that
anymore.
And I get here,
and it's all about him...
his celebration,
his idiotic stories.
He's done a great thing.
Yeah, right.
Let me know when he wins
the Nobel Prize.
- I'll meet you in Stockholm.
- That's childish.
After everything
you've been through,
you still let him live in your
house, spend your money...
He is my husband.
It's our house.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Mr. Mott...
You're punishing me.
Punishing you?
Look,
I'll do whatever
it takes, okay?
I will move back to DC.
I would... I would do that.
I'll teach here, okay?
You could come to Boston.
I will do anything to help
you if you will please,
please stop doing this.
You don't understand.
So go if you don't want
to be with us.
Can't you do this
in the morning?
Yes, I could. I'd just like
to clear some of it now.
Yes, but then you'll be up
until 2:00 a.m.
and you'll wake me
when you come upstairs.
I'm sorry that my clearing up
after our party disturbs your rest.
"Our" party? As if anyone
could get a word in.
It's Amanda, isn't it?
She put you in this mood.
Why you invite that sour little
bitch, I'll never understand.
Don't you talk about
my daughter like that,
and don't you dare smoke
in my house.
Nice beret, dude.
Hello?
She was fine.
She ate well.
She seemed
to enjoy herself.
When was the last time
you spoke with her?
Before I left the house
last night.
When was this?
When she went to bed,
I went for a walk
sometime after midnight.
I often do. She doesn't like...
Didn't like me to smoke
in the house.
And when I returned,
I found her
on the landing.
And that's
when you called 911?
Yeah.
I called immediately.
I suppose I hoped...
How old was your wife,
Mr. Mott?
She was 91.
We must all be
very brave now.
I know you left things
on a somewhat sour note
after the party.
I'm terribly...
None of that matters now.
Do you want to discuss
the arrangements?
You should know I want her
to be buried in Arlington.
Well, I want her
alongside my father.
Yeah.
I think Arlington would mean
a great deal to her.
Why?
But, of course,
I understand completely how you feel.
There are other issues.
We have to discuss
the house and my mother's
papers and her estate.
It's all taken care of.
I'll be in touch very soon.
There will be time
for tears and remembrance,
I promise.
But now there's important work
to be done.
What work?
I must find
and bring to justice
the men who killed your mother
and my wife.
The intern
We are about to enter
the inner sanctum, so to speak.
The nerve center,
the holy of holies.
This is where information
is gathered,
options weighed,
decisions made.
Decisions that affect lives:
yours, mine.
Yes, even the fate of nations.
No! I'm afraid I shall have to ask you
to refrain from taking photographs.
National security
considerations.
No, no. It's okay.
Take all the photos you like.
- Where are you folks from?
- Akron.
Cincinnati.
Look, they're visiting
their congressman's office.
I'd expect a 50-year-old intern to know
that it's constituent service, okay?
I think inculcating
an appropriate sense of the importance
of the work we're doing here
is very much of service
to the constituents.
How long you been
in the US, Ulrich?
Just a year.
But I'm on the accelerated track
at American University.
In fact, I've just been accepted
into the PhD program.
That's great. I'm just wondering if
maybe this job might not be the best fit.
Gordon, it is so funny
you should say that.
I couldn't agree more.
I feel miscast guiding tours or
arranging tickets to the Smithsonian.
Diplomatic history and practice
are my real passion.
Kissinger, Bismarck, Talleyrand.
What a genius, Talleyrand.
Have you read him?
Anyway, I was thinking
I could put together some policy
memos for the congressman.
Talk him through some of my more
complex ideas over lunch, perhaps?
No! I mean here.
Here might not be the best fit.
Are you firing me,
Mr. Nichols?
I'm encouraging you
to find a better place
to develop your unique
set of talents.
- Gordon?
- Yeah.
- Can we go over the meeting schedule?
- Yes.
Excuse me.
White House Correspondents' Dinner
Nichols.
Congressman Guyer's office.
I'm his chief of staff.
He's going to have a stroke
if I'm not at his table
when the speeches start.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
When I spoke to him
about the event,
he completely surprised me
because...
- Pardon me.
- ...attending... What?
Oh! Thank you.
Oh, you must be Elsa Breht,
the journalist?
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm Ulrich Mott.
It's an honor.
Your work is brilliant.
I read the Handelsblatt
religiously.
Oh, really?
Thank you very much.
I'm working on the Hill
while finishing a doctorate
in international relations.
Perhaps we could
have lunch sometime?
I believe
there is a great deal
I could learn from you.
Oh, well. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh! Pardon me.
Here's the car.
Thank you.
When may I see you again?
Well...
Mr. Mott, you are aware
that I'm married.
Yes. So?
So, uh, thank you
for a very enjoyable lunch
and good luck to you.
You let me know
if anything changes.
What?
No, I don't know. Nothing.
You're very amusing.
She hasn't answered
any invitations.
I used to see her every week
at the symphony,
but she stopped going.
Hi, Mother.
Who's here?
I heard voices.
Katherine.
Ah, the rescue party. Hmm.
She hadn't heard from you in
weeks, she said.
You shouldn't
have brought her here.
Well, what
am I supposed to do?
Just stand by and watch you
slide into apathy here?
I'm not apathetic.
Don't be ridiculous.
I just don't wish to be
treated like an infant.
Nobody's treating you
like an infant. We only...
Hello, darling.
Now, we're all going
to get our nails done.
And then Brzezinski's giving a talk
at the National Press Club at 3:00,
which is right
up your alley,
and then dinner
at La Chaumière.
No arguments, darling.
The reservation's already made.
Please, Mom?
Now there you
have it, there you have it!
A new year
and a new millennium.
Finally, a day that many thought
would spell the end of the world...
Yes?
Truly an historic day.
Hmm? What?
Well, surely you're watching.
- Who's this?
- Ulrich Mott.
I took you for schnitzel.
Oh, get to the point, Ulrich.
Mozart, Schumann,
Berlin Philharmonic
at the Kennedy Center
Wednesday night.
It's completely sold out,
but I obtained two tickets.
Don't ask me how.
I won't tell you.
Hmm, call me in an hour.
It is a new millennium.
The future is now here...
Hmm.
Your mother
never ceases to amaze.
I hope I look half as good
at her age.
- Me too.
- May I?
Thank you.
And suddenly
the ascendant queen
of Georgetown society.
She's been holding
a party a week, it seems.
Watch out, Sally Quinn!
What's her secret?
If you find out,
let me know.
Oh, your father
would be so glad to see it.
Darling, there's something
I need to discuss with you.
- Oh?
- Now, you remember the time when you said you felt
that I needed
some companionship,
and I was too dismissive
at the time,
and I apologize
because you were right.
Well, uh...
Well, I have something
I need to tell you too.
I got the position.
At Harvard.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Full professorship
and tenure.
They just sent
the formal offer.
Tremendous!
That's marvelous!
Yes!
They don't know how lucky they are.
- And it's all arranged?
- Well, I have to...
No, no, no, no.
No, you take it.
I wanted to discuss it
with you.
Shh. You take it.
That's all there is to it.
- Well...
- Oh, that's marvelous.
- And maybe you'll meet someone there, darling.
- Oh!
Yes, I'm not particularly
focused on that right now.
No, I know things have been very
disappointing for you in that arena.
Mom, can we not?
Look, I-I thought maybe
you'd consider going with me.
Now, I know how attached
you are to Georgetown,
but it would be so much easier
to help you out there.
Oh, darling.
I don't need help.
No. But I thought
you just said you wa...
I have everything
I need here.
What?
- Come.
- Good afternoon, my friends.
I wish to make
an announcement.
There is an ulterior motive
for our little party today.
We didn't want to make
a big thing of it,
but we also wanted to share
our joy with you.
So, please raise your glasses
with me
as I celebrate my great good
fortune in becoming engaged to marry
the extraordinary,
the dazzling Mrs. Elsa Breht.
- Hear, hear!
- Cheers!
How long
have you known him?
Lower your voice.
And I don't appreciate
being spoken to
like a virgin teenager
from some convent school.
You know, he looks like
he could be my brother.
It's not like
you don't have any choice.
You must have other suitors.
They're old and boring.
Mott is young and interesting.
I think he has
enormous potential.
Okay.
Can we just stop, please,
playing these games,
all right?
This is me.
All right?
Your only daughter, Amanda.
Do you know anything
about him?
Amanda, I don't need
your approval.
I managed to survive the war.
I managed to come to this
country and learn English
and raise a baby
and have a career.
So, I think I can manage
to marry
a very fascinating
and devoted and, yes,
somewhat younger man.
Ah, thank you.
Thank you, Grant.
I just want him out of my house.
I want him out of there now.
Miss Breht,
let me explain.
Detective, I teach
constitutional law,
so please just remove
the layer of condescension
from your voice.
Explain to me why you've left
a probable suspect alone,
at liberty,
in an active crime scene?
This is not a criminal
investigation, ma'am.
And as of now, all we have is
a deceased 90-year-old woman
and a grieving spouse,
who we intend to interview
first thing tomorrow morning.
And what about the ME?
Have they established the cause of death?
Your mother had a head injury
likely due to falling on the stairs.
You don't know that.
No, we don't.
Which is why we'll be waiting
for a full autopsy, ma'am.
Shouldn't take any more
than a couple of days.
Mr. Mott,
I want to remind you again,
you may have
an attorney present.
I'm fully aware of that,
and I don't require any attorney.
Good.
I want to go over what happened
after you first discovered
your wife's body.
I was coming home,
expecting her to be asleep in her room.
I didn't expect to see her
at all until the morning.
So, of course,
I was deeply in shock
when I saw her there.
You had separate rooms?
Yeah.
Why is that?
She was 91 years old,
Detective.
Have you ever had conjugal relations
with a woman in her early 90s?
- No.
- Neither have I.
Did you touch your wife's body at
any point after you discovered her?
I may... Yes, I may have
touched her briefly
to check for a pulse
or something.
May I say
something at this point?
- Please.
- As I told you before,
I was out for a portion
of the evening
after my wife went to bed.
I was away from the house
for several hours.
- Where did you go?
- For a walk.
For several hours?
I have very little time
for exercise during the day,
and after a heavy meal,
I find it's a necessity.
The point, gentlemen,
is this.
It seems very likely to me
that it was during this period,
between approximately 11:00
and 2:00 in the morning,
that someone broke in
and murdered my wife.
Mr. Mott, there was
no evidence of any break-in.
No, there wouldn't be,
would there?
- I don't understand.
- No, you clearly don't.
You don't understand
what you're dealing with at all.
- What do you mean, Mr. Mott?
- I mean...
Frankly, I can't believe I
have to spell this out for you.
That the sort of people capable
of committing this crime
would be far too sophisticated
to leave convenient clues
for the likes of the DC police
to stumble over.
Mr. Mott,
do you know what this is?
It is a criminal complaint.
That's right.
A complaint your wife filed
against you for assault.
Is there anything you'd
like to tell us about this?
This refers to an incident that
occurred in New York City some time ago.
That there was an argument
between my wife and I.
That, while deeply painful
and embarrassing,
it was not atypical
of the sorts of dispute
that arise between passionate
and long-married people.
That it precipitated
a break in our marriage
that was mended,
to our great mutual happiness,
after two very difficult
years apart.
Well...
given this history
and given the fact
there was no evidence
of any intruder...
We're declaring this
a homicide investigation.
Ah. I see.
And am I under arrest?
Not at the present time.
However, we have obtained a
warrant ordering your house sealed
pending further forensic
investigation.
You can't go back there.
And we're instructing you
not to leave the DC area.
It's Ulrich Mott.
Can you meet? It's urgent.
David Weatherford
State Department of the United States
Mr. Mott.
Thank you so much
for meeting me.
- Of course.
- Yeah, but let's walk, shall we?
We heard about Elsa
on the news.
Terrible shock.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
It's a very difficult time,
and I fear it's only going to get worse.
What do you mean?
I hope only a few days, but, um...
The coroner's report's due about 11:00.
I should know more then.
Oh, thank you.
This came for you
at the front desk.
Yeah, thanks.
Okay.
Yeah, believe me,
I don't want to stay in DC
another moment longer
than I have to.
Thanks.
I really appreciate it. Okay.
She left him $250,000.
Plus an additional 50 if her
liquid assets exceed $600,000.
Liquid assets.
I assume that means the house,
which has got to be worth...
close to a million.
Probably more.
And he gets that too?
Yes.
No problem, Detective.
No, no, no.
We appreciate it.
I see.
Uh, no.
I'll tell her right now.
All right.
Thank you very much.
The ME has determined
Elsa suffered injuries
consistent with
blunt force trauma.
They're opening
a homicide investigation.
- Where is he?
- Ma'am? Sorry...
That son of a bitch.
He killed her.
- Okay, ma'am, if y...
- Don't touch me!
Hang on.
Ma'am, calm down.
Don't tell me
to calm down.
There's no one here right now.
Do you have any idea where Mott might be?
How should I know?
He might have fled the country by now.
You've got to put a hold
on his passport.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.
- Are you Ulrich Mott?
- Yes.
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.
You have the right
to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an
attorney, one will be provided.
The butler
The mail just came.
And here's
my latest acquisition.
Oh, ho, ho!
Ah, bravo!
Most inventive thing
I've ever seen.
- Oh.
- Goodbye, dear.
So, we'll see you Sunday
at the Scowcroft's?
Go fetch the car.
He's very charming.
Isn't he?
Have I done
something wrong?
No.
It's all perfect.
Thank you.
You are the perfect butler.
Is that all you want to be?
You know it isn't.
So what are you
waiting for?
An opportunity.
I'm trying.
Are you?
Am I the opportunity?
You're my wife.
Vladimir Petrovsky.
He's a very dear
old friend.
A diplomat
in the Soviet era,
and now he works
in the United Nations in Geneva.
We make our opportunities.
Mr. Petrovsky?
I believe we have
a mutual friend,
Elsa Breht.
Um, no.
She sends her best.
Certainly,
I-I will tell her.
The reason for my call,
you see, um...
I-I was just thinking...
I was wondering...
I recently left my position
on the Hill...
I was leading study groups
for members of Congress
in foreign relations...
to form my own company,
my... consulting firm.
My interpersonal services
and consulting firm. Um...
We are now
a second year of operation,
and we have a number
of clients, like yourself,
who are looking for an informal
kind of representative in Washington
on an ad hoc basis.
Yeah.
Well, if there's a conference,
a meeting...
...maybe even a party that
you might have an interest in
but are unable
to be in attendance,
and we are your Washington
eyes and ears,
so to say.
Yes?
Indeed.
It's remarkable that no one's
ever thought of it before, but...
Ulrich Mott and Associates.
Let me give you
my private number.
There's no need for you
to go through my secretary.
Can I just interrupt
the conversation?
Yes, of course.
Okay.
Go ahead. Go.
Pardon me. Ulrich Mott,
representing Vladimir Petrovsky,
the UN in Geneva.
Mr. Petrovsky
sends his regrets
at not being able
to attend today.
With your kind permission,
I will read his remarks
and, after, answer any questions
you may have.
You should speak
to my husband about that.
That's exactly what Mott and
Associates was set up to handle.
May I, um...
leave my card with you?
Please, feel free...
"Ulrich Mott and Associates."
No, I don't like it.
International...
Solutions Symposium,
you know?
Keep it short.
Keep it short.
Global Solution Group?
Prominent Persons Group?
No.
No, no, no... near.
Um, T-T...
Eminent Persons Group.
Eminent Persons Group.
So, she has them...
Oh, there she is.
Oh, he is so sweet!
He's very intelligent.
Yes. Well, I assume so.
If only one can have grandchildren.
I don't have...
He's with the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency.
Excellent contact.
Could be very valuable to us.
Good.
All right.
This is a preliminary detention hearing
in the case of United States
v. Ulrich Gero Mott...
Uh, uh, Your Honor,
there are a few issues
that Mr. Mott would like
to raise before the court.
What sort of issues?
Mr. Mott hasn't
told me in detail.
He made it clear he'd like to be
heard on this as opposed to me, so...
All right.
Thank you, Your Honor,
and good morning.
Good morning.
I wish to lodge
the following complaints:
The United States
is in open violation
of my rights
under the Geneva Convention.
I am, and remain, a serving
officer in a foreign army,
and as such am entitled
to my uniform and insignia,
as well as to be addressed
by my full rank,
Brigadier General
Ulrich Mott.
I'm sorry, did you say
brigadier general?
That is correct.
In the United States Army?
No. The Iraqi
Special Forces.
Well, as regards
the legal issues you raise,
I'll ask the government
to look into them and respond.
All right?
Are we ready to proceed?
Yes, Your Honor.
Could you get us some
documentation on that?
The court's going
to want to see it.
Proof of my rank, you mean?
Yeah.
Well, of course.
That goes without saying.
I can arrange it
immediately.
Mr. Mott,
it would have been helpful
if you had told us ahead of time
about your military...
affiliation, or whatever
you choose to call it.
Tell me...
why is it my job
to do your due diligence?
I didn't ask for you
to represent me.
And I can't say I'm particularly
impressed so far
if something as basic as my military
service takes you by surprise.
I've been active in the international
community for years through the EPG.
The EPG?
The Eminent Persons Group,
my NGO.
Non-governmental organization.
Right, got it.
Is there anything else
that we should know
going forward
that you haven't told us?
Absolutely not.
I have at every stage
been completely candid.
I was candid with the police
when I was told I was a suspect.
I surrendered myself willingly
when they came to my home
to arrest me for a brutal
and sickening crime
because I am innocent
of that crime.
Why did you leave the house on
the night of your wife's death?
I went for a walk.
Yes. Why?
Why do people go for walks?
For fresh air. For exercise.
To smoke a cigar.
Because I'd been sitting at a
dinner table all night long.
Because it's my regular habit.
Shall I go on?
Mr. Mott, where did you go?
Around the neighborhood.
And is there anyone
who can corroborate this?
If you find a pedestrian
who took note
of a perfectly ordinary man taking
a perfectly ordinary stroll,
then, yes,
they can corroborate.
Otherwise, you
and the DC Superior Court
will somehow have to acquaint yourselves
with the concept of a man taking a walk.
The diplomat
That is our mission.
Thank you.
Michael Rocard
Former Prime Minister of France
It is absolutely
imperative to continue
to get absolutely
everybody on board.
Sorry.
Monsieur le Premier Ministre.
Excusez-moi.
Um...
I was extraordinarily
impressed by your remarks.
Particularly your
emphasis on reform
of the UN Security Council.
You are absolutely right.
It could not be
more essential,
especially for those of us who
care about nonproliferation.
Thank you very much, Mr....
Mott. Ulrich Mott.
I am with the Eminent
Persons Group.
Sorry.
You know, we're becoming
increasingly involved
in counterterrorism issues.
Perhaps sometime we could
discuss some areas
where we might work together?
Perhaps.
Are you free for lunch
next week?
Uh, the embassy
keeps my schedule
while I'm in the States.
I really don't...
- Let me give you my card.
- Call the embassy.
I'm so sorry.
As I mentioned...
Yes. Monsieur Michel Rocard,
please.
Ulrich Mott from
the Eminent Persons Group.
Ulrich Mott!
Yeah, I'd like to discuss that
personally with Monsieur Ro...
Well, we're good friends.
He asked me to call
and arrange for lunch.
Is he in?
I think it would be best
if I spoke directly...
Well, all right.
I'll leave my number.
Where did you live
when you first came to America?
What was it like?
In Nebraska?
All of it.
Coming here after the war.
First home in ruins,
this new one beckoning.
Was it exhilarating?
Was it terrifying?
Bit of both.
You were quite
the adventuress.
When Tom left the army
and proposed
to take me home to Lincoln,
I thought he was crazy.
It was a big change
from Bavaria.
And I liked it.
The people were...
Well, they didn't treat me
as a German or an enemy
or even as a stranger.
They were extraordinarily kind.
It's what I love
about America.
Mm.
It's a rather small state,
Nebraska, isn't it?
You could fit the entire
population into Georgetown.
Did you know everyone?
We were very close-knit.
Yeah.
Did you know Chuck Hagel,
the senator?
Elsa? It's Chuck.
How are you, my dear?
Chuck Hagel
United States Senator, Nebraska
Well, such a treat
to hear from an old friend
after such a long time.
Look, we'd be delighted
to be at your party
honoring the French PM,
no less.
Uh, well,
I hope your caterer's
up to it.
Motti,
I don't understand.
Is Senator Hagel or Rocard
the guest of honor?
Both.
Oh, are they aware
of that?
Yeah, well, just stop
asking so many questions.
Be dressed and ready on time,
and everything will sort itself out.
Is Michel Rocard coming?
Yes!
Hagel is the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
He'll come.
Do you still
have the dog?
Do I have a dog?
It only became famous
because of the Oregon Trail.
It's not so much
where we come from.
Well... ...it was what
they could grow cheap in the climate.
- Mm.
- It's a brutal climate in the winter,
and we've got
a short growing season.
You need something
that'll grow quickly.
- My father was in corn.
- Oh, really?
Um...
I think we just proceed.
- Oh, well, sure.
- May I invite you?
Come on, love.
Please.
Madam, I think
if I put you here,
that's where you belong.
Excuse me. Um, sit.
Remarkable.
Ah! Oh, just something
I threw together.
You did the cooking?
Mm.
Pardon me, but weren't you wearing
an eye patch the last time we met?
An eye patch?
I don't think so, no.
I think a toast is in order.
Mm-hmm.
To our guest of honor...
Elsa Breht.
Not exactly as announced,
I know,
but suddenly I realized
none of us would be here
enjoying this marvelous evening
without her.
So, after all,
that's the most important thing,
isn't it?
- Hear, hear.
- Santé.
Pardon me to interrupt.
- Ah! You are a man...
- Oh!
...of refined taste.
Thank you.
Lovely.
As you both well know,
only 110
out of more than 190
UN member states
have designated these agencies.
And only round about 30
have actually established
national exchange mechanisms.
Yes.
Now, this is exactly where
the EPG's ideally positioned
to generate some concrete
progress and momentum.
Well, it's a very compelling
presentation.
Peggy Mason
Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations
And, of course,
Michel's a dear friend.
I'd be delighted to help out
with anything he's involved in.
- Mm. Wonderful. Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Mr. Mott.
Or should I call you
Count Albi?
Did my assistant use my family title?
I told him not to.
It's not very democratic,
is it? Ah!
I'll speak to him about it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
University of Michigan.
Good school, but not top tier.
Very little experience...
no contacts.
No roommate from Yale
in the West Wing,
or Daddy's law partner
on the Hill?
Well, I just moved here
from Michigan.
You remind me very much
of a young Ulrich Mott.
You're hired.
Michel Rocard
and Ambassador Mason
recommended I reach out
to Mr. Soros directly.
The Office of Geroge Soros
Activist, politician, billionaire and philanthropist
I hope you don't mind, uh,
but I took the liberty
of bringing
our materials myself.
Why send a staffer?
I'd like to walk you
through them.
Um, so I said to him,
Robert Mcnamara
Former Secretary of Defense
"Well, that may have worked
in Jackson's time."
- Mr. McNamara?
- Yes?
We haven't met.
Ulrich Mott from
the Eminent Persons Group.
Forgive me,
but the coincidence is extraordinary.
Just this morning,
Mr. George Soros was recommending
I get in touch with you.
Would you have a minute?
George?
Certainly. Pull up a seat.
President Bush
regards this
as an historic moment...
Now that a new chapter
is beginning
for both of our countries,
we hope that you'll consider our
home a sort of second embassy.
Oh!
Just a few years ago,
when I was just out of the service...
Were you in the military?
Um, yeah.
French Foreign Legion.
Don't get me started
on those stories.
We won't.
Anyway, I was, uh,
weary, I admit.
Burned out.
But then I formed the EPG.
He's not only the most
successful cricket captain
in the history of the sport...
You do know what
cricket is, don't you?
He's also a member of the
Pakistani fucking parliament.
Therefore, you cannot seat him
next to the fucking
waiter's station!
The only thing
that looks good is this.
Diplomacy,
Winston Churchill once said,
is the art of telling people
to go to hell in such a way
that they ask
for directions.
With apologies
to the prime minister,
I prefer to think of it as
the art of helping people
to find their own
path to heaven.
A Ponzi scheme?
You get one name,
and you use that
to get the next and the next
and the next and the next.
I think that's
just a bit unfair.
Ponzi stole money.
He bankrupted people.
I was holding conferences.
But all right.
I'm self-made. So what?
Is that a crime?
Maybe in Washington it is.
So, a senator's son was
not my roommate at Yale.
I built something myself.
What about Elsa?
- What about her?
- You used her.
Her money,
her... connections.
I did not use Elsa.
How could you suggest
such a thing?
She gave me what she did
out of love.
She gave me courage
and a belief in myself.
I owe her everything.
Which makes the accusation
that has put me in here
all the more ludicrous.
Mr. Mott,
were you ever violent
with your wife?
Were you?
Violent?
No.
Did I do things of which
I've come to feel ashamed?
Deeply ashamed? Of course.
Show me a marriage where both
partners have not made mistakes.
Show me a marriage
without regret.
The incident
The situation in Iraq is
unacceptable to the American people.
Our troops in Iraq
have fought bravely.
They have done everything
we have asked them to do.
Where mistakes have been made,
the responsibility
rests with me.
Iraqi embassy
Washington, D.C.
What I am suggesting
is simply that the EPG
is now ideally
positioned
to play
a much larger role
in the reconstruction
of postwar Iraq.
Well, let me,
let me first say
how grateful we are
to you already, Mr. Mott.
You and your wife have organized
some marvelous events.
We've so enjoyed ourselves
at your parties...
Fine, fine,
but now it's time to go beyond that.
It's all very well chatting
with friends over cocktails,
but now is a moment
for action.
I see.
And, uh, what sort of thing
did you have in mind?
Well, it's all detailed
in this proposal,
but, broadly,
we bring together in one location
all the enemies
of the United States
and a free Iraq.
So, uh, the Taliban,
al-Sadr and the Madhi Army,
the other jihadists,
everyone.
We meet on some relatively
neutral territory,
let us say Kurdistan.
And there we launch the mother
of all peace conferences.
Refereed, so to speak,
brokered, shepherded,
whatever word you like,
by the EPG.
By you.
Well, yes, in my capacity
as the head of the EPG,
I would oversee this process.
I sent an identical proposal
to Kofi, and, uh...
Sorry!
To the secretary general's
office at the UN,
and we're going
to discuss it Thursday.
What are those medals?
I'm sorry?
Those insignia on your chest.
I'm just admiring them.
But I'm afraid
I don't recognize any.
Um,
the various honors
I've accumulated over...
Any of them from
the French Foreign Legion?
I remember hearing you served.
No, these are different.
Ah, I see.
Back to the matter at hand.
Mr. Mott,
surely you must be aware
that we want no association
with the Taliban, the Sadrists
or any of the parties
you mentioned.
Moreover,
such an ambitious plan,
if it's indeed possible,
would have to fall under the purview
of the US State Department
or the Organization
of Arabic States or the UN.
Read the proposal,
why don't you?
Perhaps the French
Foreign Legion could help.
Thank you for your time
and for your concern.
If you have any other ideas,
please don't hesitate
to let us know.
Our door is always open.
Mr. Mott, how'd it go?
What'd they say?
Very receptive.
I'm very encouraged.
- Do you want to go back to the office now?
- No. You go.
I'm going to need
a fucking drink.
Where have you been?
Working.
Liar.
Whoa! You stink of alcohol.
And you reek
of the grave.
Motti?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
They laughed at me,
today at the embassy.
I brought them
something magnificent,
and they laughed at me.
Ah, Motti.
Sometimes I...
I think they are all
laughing at me, you know?
The whole town, the whole...
the whole world.
"Who does he think he is?
A little nobody
from nowhere."
Mm.
"His parents were failures,
and he is a nothing.
Just a pathetic little joke
to be laughed at."
Oh, Motti.
I believe in you.
I will never laugh at you.
Promise me.
Please.
I promise.
Elsa.
And just right this way
is our Ambassador Suite.
Oh, no, no, no.
We booked a normal room.
No, it's correct.
I upgraded us.
I hope you don't mind.
We deserve it.
Oh, Motti!
Oh, you are a devil.
I'll call you
after my meeting.
Are you sure
you'll be all right?
- Of course.
- Taxi.
I've been coming to New York
since before you were born.
- Where will you be?
- Bergdorf, Bendel's, Chanel.
Within a six-block radius,
and I'm having tea with a friend.
Be good now.
I'll be back around 6:00.
Don't bankrupt us.
Yes, darling?
How is it in Boston?
Now, listen, I'm in New York,
and I have just found
the most gorgeous Chopard watch
for Ulrich.
No, no, no, no!
Listen, listen, listen.
He deserves it because he's speaking at
the United Nations conference for the EPG.
I'm so proud of him.
Hmm.
I thought you were out
shopping.
I thought you were
at the United Nations!
I finished.
- Who's this?
- A friend.
Ow! Goddamn it!
Are you mad?
You! How could you?
You disgrace!
Don't make such a fuss.
Why did you do this?
You didn't expect me to stay
celibate all these years.
You had to keep it
out of our life,
out of my bed,
out of my sight!
There never was a UN
meeting, was there?
How could there be?
Whoever would want
to meet with you?
Don't you ever speak
to me like that!
You lie! You lie,
you lie, you lie!
Every syllable you utter
is a lie!
I'm really sorry.
If he had told me that his
mother was staying here, I...
Yes! Why don't you knock
next time, Mother?
Go ahead, bitch. Do it.
Out! Out!
Go!
You are nothing.
You're just a lying, depraved,
disgusting gigolo!
Oh, my God.
This could take all afternoon.
Here, let me help you.
Better yet, let's do
yours, shall we?
You stop it! Stop it!
This suite is in my name,
and you are no longer
welcome here.
So you've
no idea where he is?
No.
Had you been having
problems?
Only what any normal couple
goes through.
Don't say
we're not a normal couple.
No.
I only wish
I knew where he was.
Was there a complaint signed
against Mr. Mott in 2006
- by the decedent, Mrs. Breht?
- Yes.
In which she was locked out of
her hotel room and assaulted?
And Mr. Mott threw a bowl
of, uh, soup at Mrs. Breht?
- Objection.
- Sustained.
Well, I beg your pardon.
The report merely stated
she had "soup in her hair
and on her clothes,"
and when the police arrived,
they found a woman in her 80s
locked out of her suite
with all of her baggage.
Yes.
No more questions.
You've identified
Government Exhibit 4,
which is the document
presented
to Mrs. Breht's daughter
the day after
she was found dead.
Yes.
So, if the will
you identified stands,
- would he stand to gain anything?
- Yes.
Between $250,000 and $300,000,
as well as Mrs. Breht's house.
Exhibit 24, very helpfully
provided by the defense,
confirming Ulrich Gero Mott's
appointment
as brigadier general
of the Iraqi Army
by Nouri al-Maliki,
the prime minister and acting
minister of defense of Iraq.
And this is confirming
my own appointment
as People magazine's
sexiest man of the year,
certified
by Her Majesty, Queen...
Objection!
...the second of England,
and it's printed via...
- Objection!
- ...the website
FreeQualityCertificates.com.
That was
a fucking disaster.
It was a bloodbath.
You just sat there
doing nothing.
Well, you tell me
what we were supposed to do.
You have an assault charge.
That's probable cause
right there.
And I was so mortified,
so ashamed,
that I left the country
for two years.
Why don't you let me
tell them about that?
Sure, so you can
also tell them
how you became an Iraqi
brigadier general.
My credentials
are 100% genuine
despite that moronic
courtroom stunt.
How could you two amateurs
have let that go unchallenged?
That alone is grounds
for a mistrial.
You're sure someone else killed your
wife, but you have no idea who.
You won't even tell us where
you went the night of the 11th.
I told you a thousand times,
I went for a fucking walk.
That isn't good enough!
I'm sorry. It's bullshit.
Yeah, it is.
And you're right.
This is not going your way.
So, if you have another
theory on this case,
then you should really
share it with us
because we're running
out of options here.
I was reluctant
to do this.
Could create difficulties for
a number of innocent people.
People who do not deserve to be
dragged into this mess, but...
If you want to know
my theory of the case,
as you call it...
I urge you to speak
at the earliest opportunity
to a Mr. David Weatherford.
Weatherford?
Weatherford.
He's deputy assistant for Mideast
affairs at the State Department,
and he has my complete
confidence and trust.
He's in possession of materials
that, properly analyzed...
may expose the actual parties
responsible for Elsa's death.
I advise you
to prepare yourselves.
The information
is bound to be
disturbing at best,
but in a worst-case scenario,
geopolitically destabilizing.
Ask him for my communiqués.
Ask him about
Zarathustra.
Here we go. Just...
Yeah, Weatherford?
You Volker?
This is Durant,
my partner.
Hey.
You read all these?
Yes.
And?
You'll see.
The enlistment
Hello. Hello? Hello?
Hello, Elsa?
Motti!
Motti, is that you?
Where-Where are you?
I've been busy.
I think it's unlikely
you'll see me for some time.
Yes, but where are you?
The connection is poor.
And, in any case,
you may not have wanted
to hear from me at all,
but this is
the most exhilarating,
terrifying,
important work
I've ever done,
and I can't enjoy it
without you.
I miss you so much.
That's all I called to say.
Yes, yes, yes. Where are y...
Dan?
Have you ever heard
of someone called Ulrich Mott?
- No. Should I?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure we should.
- Why?
- Because he seems more or less single-handedly
to be trying to stop
the insurgency.
"Urgent. From: Ulrich Mott,
Villa Zarathustra, Sadr City, Iraq.
To: Undersecretary for Mideast
Affairs, eyes only.
Do not distribute.
November 14, 2006. Baghdad.
I am one of the few
who is in direct contact
with both the leading heads
of the national insurgency,
including Messrs.
al-Sadr and Hakim,
and the foreign jihadists,
notably Abu Ayyub al-Masri,
head of al-Qaeda."
It, uh, just came
over the transom.
He's the head
of a small NGO, uh...
Some pretty heavy hitters
on his board...
Soros,
Robert McNamara.
He seems to be working
as some sort of envoy
to Muqtada al-Sadr.
Wait! What?
He says he's
trying to steer the Madhi Army
away from violence and towards
some sort of peace settlement.
"I am seriously thinking
of accepting
Al-Sadr's offer to embed.
Let ours be the guns
heard last. Ulrich."
Who the fuck authorized the embed of
a German national with the Madhi Army
and said he could negotiate
on our behalf?
Nobody.
And it appears he's doing all
of this on his own initiative.
Well, make him fucking stop!
"December 7th, 2006.
Villa Zarathustra, Sadr City.
Dear Mr. Secretary, thank you
for the message of encouragement.
I regret I was unable
to take your call,
but the brothers are very strict
on non-intrusions from the secular,
especially during prayers."
You don't have any way
of contacting him?
Is Mott running
this organization or not?
He hasn't been in touch with me
in a while.
All I know is he's somewhere
in the Middle East.
If you find him,
could you ask him
when I'm gonna get paid?
You wouldn't believe it. Mookie...
al-Sadr... he wears these dentures.
You see,
they don't fit him very well.
They give him a lisp.
When he tried to say
the word "assassin,"
it came out "athathin."
Oh, my God!
And when he gets mad,
he takes them out altogether.
I keep trying
to discourage this,
and I emphasize
there's two priorities...
keep the dentures in,
make peace with the Americans.
But not necessarily
in that order.
And, Mrs. Breht,
what your husband
appears to be doing,
conducting a sort of
one-man, freelance
diplomatic mission
in a nation with which
we are actively engaged
is just extraordinarily
counterproductive and ill advised.
It's frankly unprecedented.
We don't understand how anyone could
possibly think it could succeed.
You don't know Ulrich.
"26 December, 2007,
Villa Zarathustra.
As you are aware,
I first outlined the proposition
to enlist Sunni insurgents and
Shia militias in a memorandum
to then UN Sec-Gen Annan
in 2004
and had the outline circulated
at the Iraqi embassy.
It formed the basis
of my original Iraq mission
upon arriving in Baghdad
in fall 2006,
a mission
I continue to pursue,
albeit one I sometimes fear
I will not live to complete."
We've been studying
your emails from Iraq.
I knew David would come through.
He is a good man.
And he's taking quite a risk.
These are highly classified.
That's actually something
we wanted to ask.
Since you sent them,
they are your messages.
Why couldn't you have just given
them to us from the beginning?
A little test, Mr. Volker,
and one you've passed
with flying colors.
Test. Okay.
You discuss
a number of missions...
Hang on! One second,
one second! One second.
You're not recording this,
are you?
No. This is just us
trying to understand.
Very well. Carry on.
The missions
you went on
on behalf of al-Sadr...
Mookie, yes.
...you wrote that you had
potentially antagonized
some of the insurgent factions,
groups affiliated with al-Qaeda
in Iraq.
Groups that didn't want al-Sadr
making a peace deal with the US,
who would blame you
if that came about.
Yeah.
Very good, Mr. Volker.
Very good indeed.
You've got the scent in your nostrils now.
Keep hunting.
Okay.
Mr. Mott,
why don't you just tell us
who you think
killed your wife?
We're your attorneys.
We are trying to help you.
But you keep throwing us
these curveballs.
We've done
all of this work, and...
you tell us
to keep hunting.
I mean, we have been
studying these things.
I mean, I just...
For God's sake, man.
Do we really have to go
through this all over again?
Operational security,
eyes only, need to know.
Do you really imagine
I've achieved what I have
by being reckless
with privileged information?
Oh, God, the two of you
really are hopeless.
I'm afraid I shall be
representing myself from now on.
Good day to you both.
So, you'll get the
grocery delivery every week.
- It's all set up.
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
- And if you want to change anything in the order,
the number's by the phone
in the kitchen.
- All right.
- I'll be back next month. It's the midterm break.
Call me if you need anything.
I could come back earlier...
Stop it.
I'll be absolutely fine.
And I left some casseroles in the
kitchen in the freezer just in case.
Oh, you know
I despise casseroles.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
What?
He calls me sometimes.
What?
He sounds so far away.
But also like
he's next door.
Don't take his calls.
Please.
You are so much better off.
You know that. Wherever the hell he is.
He's in Iraq.
Iraq?
He's doing
extraordinary things.
I keep replaying
that day in New York
in my head over and over,
and h-how you stood me,
I can't imagine.
It's in the past.
And I was not always so easy.
When I'm finished here, is there a ch...
No, no. I shouldn't.
No, no. Go on, go on.
Just knowing
there is a possibility
would be enough to sustain me
through the trials ahead.
Is there a chance
that I could come home?
To Georgetown?
To you?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, maybe.
I've experienced today
one of the most sublime,
the most exquisite moments
of my life.
I've been on watch
at Mookie's camp all night,
and it gets very cold
in the desert at night.
The chill creeps into your
bones, and the doubt.
And I was wondering
what it was all for.
Whether there was any real
purpose for my being here at all.
And then I heard the music.
Mookie had found...
God knows how...
a recording of a Prussian
military march
and played it
over the camp loudspeaker.
And I have no idea how he knew that
I loved that music from childhood,
let alone
how he found the recording.
Then the men formed up
and paid a tribute to me.
And he was telling me
I belonged.
That my efforts here
have not been wasted.
That I have made a difference
after all.
And that, perhaps, now...
...it's time to come home.
Come in.
Sorry. I was just picking up the mail.
One second.
Oh, okay. That's better.
The truth
Yeah.
Right over there.
That way.
Inside there.
I said that dozens,
possibly hundreds of times.
I'm not guilty of the murder
of my wife Elsa Breht.
It was my understanding
that you were no longer
representing Mr. Mott.
Where is the defendant?
Your Honor, Mr. Mott
has refused to communicate
with either me or my colleague
for several weeks now,
so we're unable to proceed.
What's going on,
Counselor?
Uh, Mr. Mott
is currently engaged
in a hunger strike.
He's in a weakened condition and
has since been moved to a hospital.
We're therefore
submitting a motion
to have him declared
unfit for trial.
The court will have to make
a determination about that.
Of course.
- Thank you.
- I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Are you really going to
help him wiggle out of this?
We have to wait
for the evaluation.
If he's found mentally unfit...
He's faking.
It's obvious.
- Like he faked everything.
- You don't know that.
I don't know that.
The more I find out about this
guy, the less I understand.
You know every word he says
is a fucking lie.
Maybe.
But what about Iraq?
How the hell did he do
what he did there?
Can you explain that?
I can't.
Can't you do this
in the morning?
Yes, I could. I'd just like
to clear some of it now.
Yes, but then you'll be up
until 2:00 a.m.,
and you'll wake me
when you come upstairs.
I'm sorry that my clearing up
after our party disturbs your rest.
"Our" party? As if anyone
could get a word in.
It's Amanda, isn't it?
She put you in this mood.
Why you invite that sour little
bitch, I'll never...
Don't you talk about
my daughter like that.
And don't you dare
smoke that in my house.
Yeah. Excellent.
Um, can we talk?
Not on the telephone. It's not prudent.
It has to be in person.
Who is that?
Who are you talking to?
Quiet! Um...
Well, as soon as you can.
- I can meet you now.
- No, you can't.
That would...
Shut your fucking face!
Can't I have a second's peace?
Why don't you crawl away
to your bed? Go! Go to bed!
Excuse me.
At the usual place?
Yeah. Excellent, excellent.
- What?
- Who was that?
That is on a need-to-know basis,
and you do not need to know.
You're late.
Is it Halloween already?
Should've worn my cowboy hat.
Very amusing.
Have a drink.
I'm having another myself.
How's the old lady?
If you're still with her
and, uh, if she's still with us.
Elsa's quite well,
thank you.
And, yes,
things are wonderful between us.
She's a remarkable woman.
Great.
I wouldn't be where I
am now if not for Elsa.
I'm well aware
of what I owe her.
That is not to say
it isn't also plain to me
the extent
to which I've outgrown her.
It's not her fault, of course.
It's just the path life takes.
She's lent me the wings
with which I now take flight.
Uh-huh.
Great things ahead.
Grand adventures.
Vast new horizons
to explore.
I could use
a good soldier at my side.
What do you say?
Like the old days?
Well, if I'd known
the occasional mediocre fuck
in a hotel
made me a good soldier...
I know I've been out of
touch for a long time,
and I'm sorry.
I understand how hard
that must have been for you.
I was doing difficult
and necessary work.
- I couldn't risk contacting you.
- No.
Of course not.
I warn you...
can't be like it was
before.
Going forward,
we shall have to be rigorously discreet.
I may have to impart
some lessons in tradecraft,
surveillance detection,
so forth.
I have more now to lose
than ever.
Not just Elsa. Lives all over
the world could be jeopardized
should my reputation
be compromised.
You know what?
Better not risk it then.
- Wait.
- That old lady was right.
You're pathetic.
Where have you been?
- Working.
- Hmm.
Oh, yes.
With one of your friends.
Shut up.
One of your disgusting
sodomite friends.
Shut your fucking face.
Amanda was right.
I should never have
let you back here.
Amanda? You say her name
to me tonight?
After I do her the common
courtesy of inviting her here,
including her amongst the great and the
powerful on the evening of my triumph,
and she has to storm out
sulking before the main course
like the silly, spoiled
American little cunt she is!
Get out! Get out!
I don't want you here
anymore.
- Oh!
- Get out!
This is my house!
I live here!
They should have carted you off
to the mausoleum years ago!
- You stay here...
- Where do you belong?
...by the grace and charity
of Ulrich Gero Mott,
Count Albi, brigadier general
of the Republic of Iraq!
Brigadier general,
Republic of Iraq.
What?
The great
brigadier general
with a horseshoe
up his ass!
Oh, sad. You need to denigrate
me to sustain yourself.
Your great
American rescue.
That was a coincidence,
wasn't it?
What a piece of luck!
You can't stand
what I've become.
I've grown so much greater
than what you imagined,
you can't comprehend it.
You can't stand
that I don't need you anymore.
I've transcended you!
Oh, bravo!
You can't stand that I'm not
your fucking butler anymore!
Oh, I know
you're not my butler.
- You do, yeah?
- You're a fucking hotel clerk.
Yes, a hotel clerk
in a crappy hotel.
What?
Two years
in a crappy motel
with TV and breakfast
and a heated pool.
Yes! I looked it all up.
I have your tax statements.
All of your tax statements!
All of them!
You idiot!
You gave them
this home address
as your
permanent address.
You poor idiot.
Working for two years
in a crappy motel.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Sorry, the Villa
Zarathustra.
Oh, the Mookie
and the troops saluting.
You idiot!
You're an idiot, do you hear?
Idiot. Idiot! Fool!
And the men formed up
and paid
a kind of tribute to me.
He was telling me I belonged...
that my efforts here
have not been wasted.
That I have made a difference
after all.
You should have
come home in that uniform.
Albrecht Gero Muth,
not to be confused with Ulrich Gero Mott,
is currently serving
a 50-year sentence in federal prison
for the murder of his wife.
