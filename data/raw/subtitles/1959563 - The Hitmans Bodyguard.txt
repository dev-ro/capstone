Safe travels.
Thank you very much, Michael.
I apologize for such an unexpected late visit, Professor.
You're always welcome, Mr. President.
In your house with soldiers, yes.
In your classroom I've been told I'm less popular.
Nothing is more important than a good education.
Shut up for two seconds!
That's bad.
I don't speak French.
Shame.
Shit.
I know this Darius Kincaid we're talking about.
I want proof he's dead.
Proof? Like a photo?
Like a head.
Split up and take different floors.
Quick they're heading for the roof.
Darius has gone.
Nothing but cops out here.
I shit on your whore of a mother.
I shit on your whore of a mother.
The others have picked up a signal.
Here's the phone.
Ivan says Kincaid is still on the move.
If God wishes a man dead...
Ivan will find him.
And if God's not ready for Kincaid to die?
Make sure the back-up plan is in place.
Everyone keep a close lookout. He's here somewhere.
Understood.
Can I help you?
That's him.
Get rid of the Interpol car!
Shoot him.
Hit the brakes!
It's two hours until the deadline. How are we doing?
Goran has the bodyguard.
I'm going to interrogate him now.
No, I need you here in case Kincaid shows up.
Goran will make him talk.
What kind of asshole wears a helmet this tight?
That's them!
We have them.
Blue Ford C-Max on Route 44.
Initiate alternative measures.
I'm fine.
Take her down!
