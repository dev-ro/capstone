Behold - The  Castle of Cachtice.
An unconquerable stronghold
that time will turn into stones and dust.
The last witness to  the
mysterious story ...
of Hungarys wealthiest noble woman
Countess Erzsebet Bathory.
Here, as the legend says, she tortured
and killed innocent virgins ...
and bathed in their blood to  stay
young and beautiful forever.
The fewer the facts,
the plentiful the legends.
The truth will remain forgotten
in this forgotten dungeon,
from where the countesses desperate wailing  and sobbing
could be heard night after night.
Until the devil himself took pity on her
and setting her on his firey steed
carried her away,
to the darkest depths of hell.
Or was it an angel?
And was the story
rather different perhaps?
I trust my  daughter
Erzsebet Bathory,
in marriage to Ferenc Nadasdy.
That  our
families may be united!
This union will be the  most
powerful in Hungary.
Erzsebet!  Erzsebet!
Look!  I have my own horse!
Now I am a man.
Marriage is a duty and love a sin.
Ferenc will increase
the family fortune,
your job is to manage
and preserve it.
And look after the servants.
The can´t work if they are ill.
Erzsebet!
Viva young couples!
Dear Countess, we have a duty to
our families, to conceive a son.
How are we going to accomplish this?
My uncle told me,  do
not worry, my dear.
For centuries, the Turks
and Tatars devastated
and plundered the kingdom of Hungary.
Killing and destroying everything that
Hungarians held sacred.
Erzsebet.
Finally, the Protestant lord set aside
their dispute with the Catholics,
and together rows to wage war
against the Muslims.
The fate of this vast land,
which people spoke  13
different languages,
fell into the hands of some powerful,
led by Ferenc Nadasdy.
Look at the Habsburgs.
Always the first to flee.
I like to see the infidels
kicking Catholics.
I told you will not be bored for long.
For God and Hungary!
Guide your people  to victory!
Hungary!
The Turks.
Count Nadasdy ...
fearless warrior  and commander,
always stood in the front of the  brave
son of Hungary.
The bleeding Hungarian kingdom,
became the last bastion
protecting Christian Europe
against the infidels.
History is written by  winners,
and the Chronicles,
by fools like me  a humble
monk named Peter.
My testimony is not a legend
about heroes like Ferenc
but about life and death of
his beautiful wife Erzsebet.
The three dragon teeth
from her family crest
represent the three names
that marked his life
and, ultimately,
fulfilled her destiny.
BATHORY
Part I:  FERENC
Cachtice
-Countess.
-Thurzo?
Where is Ferenc?
-Don´t worry, he is safe.
It was a great victory.
Here sends a list of war trophies.
He sends you a gift.
Look out the window.
The best gift would be
to have Ferenc home.
My little fairy.
he is an Italian painter
we stole from the Turks.
Come.
He should be painting roses  shutters
to the Pasha of Budin,
but in exchange for this portrait,
Ferenc promised him freedom.
-Move, miserable!  -Let me go!
I´m a protege of
Cardinal Del Monte.
Move!
Maybe he can  capture your beauty.
Come on, Maria.
Faster!  You so sweet.
Ferenc, my beloved black
horse.
Perhaps you could stop by
after the Sunday service
to sign your agreement  for
the next half year.
Don´t worry, pastor,  I´ll sign it
in Ferences name.
-Wait!  -Yes, Istvan?
Our painter hast ordered half
the forest for his paints.
And he still wants more.
What else does he need, Istvan?
What kind of rose is this?
a Venetian.
Blue as a Venetian sky.
Three days mourning
our dead comrades.
We have been living close to death.
Ferenc ...
you are drunk.
Tomorrow, I am conquering
the  Fortress near the Eger.
Tonight, I am conquering you.
-Ferenc. Ferenc.
Ferenc, no!  Ferenc, no!
-I beg you.
My baby!
-Love can not hurt the baby.
Ferenc!
No!
My baby!
This war without end,
turned me into a brute.
Even when I am with you,
I act like a barbarians.
Erzsebet Honey, forgive me
the pain that I caused you.
I never forgive myself
the loss of our unborn son.
My ...  Damn. That was close.
See Nadasdy, cannon balls,  arrows,
everything mises him.
Is the luck of the devil.
God gave Nadasdy courage and strength.
That's all.
Yes, Bathany.
And wealth ...  And a beautiful woman.
You envy him?  -Of course.
Beautiful women are hard to find.
When the master get drunk,
they become as strong as horses,
and then they just go and hunt
a defenceless orphan, like me.
We´ll be out here
if we get pregnant and
the Countess finds out.
But you´re sweet.
No!
You can have me  for nothing.
Come on, Merisi!
Possess me as does the master!
Leave me alone!  Get out!
-Open the door, Merisi.
Who? By God ...
Why is it locked?
I´m mixing paints.
See that red ...
as our blood.
Symbolizes life and love.
Erika
I was drawing from memory.
See?
Tomorrow you´ll begin painting
me and my daughters.
You preserve  what I have left.
Praise God!
Our  Countess is well again.
Countess is taking their young man
to the manor house.
Now she´s gonna have
all the fun she wants.
-Yes!  -Shut up!
It´s the only thing you think of.
Do you know how many children
her herbs have saved?
I can´t capture
the curves of your body.
I need a naked model.
An honest woman shows
her body to no one.
Not even her husband.
See this skull.
I never painted any creature  without
knowing its skeleton.
In Florence painters
dissect the dead.
What this place?  A torture chamber?
My hospital.
Use this to  cauterize the wound.
This is what I use to let blood
on your leeches.
- Dio mio.
-Shut up or cut your leg off!
-What this?
-Drawings of medicinal herbs.
God, please don´t let me die
in this horrible place
You are the only one who paints?
What's this?  A list of all his victims?
Subjects I have cured.
Here it is.  Hang on the sinner, Dora.
No, no, no ...
No worry
That will teach you
to paint naked women.
-Move, Erika.  -Let me go.
She wanted to flee  madam.
God, help me!
There were five of them.
Overthrew the  all doors and raped us.
They were drunk. Waving their sabres and shouting.
There was nothing we could do.
Which one attacked you?
I think it was the officer,
with a scar on his forehead.
Thurzo?
Every night some man
tries to enter my room.
Even the old Istvan.
Put out your hand.
For your protection.
BATTLE ESZTERGOM
There is only one God.
But the world stands divided
by the ways
each of this flock comes on to him.
Why Turks  dropped suddenly?
They got scared  coward Muslims.
-What the Habsburgs are doing?
They don´t care about the orders.
There are two harems on this was
and they are celebrating already.
The battle is not over!
Go back to the battle,
you lazy bastards.
The commander enjoy the spoils
of war as well.
This can be a trap!
The Turks surrendered  too fast.
These whores Turkish so good.
Attack!
These Turks pigs.
Thurzo, let´s back up,
to get out of here alive.
Lets get out!
Why not paint my face?
I am waiting  that you smile.
Why hide  such beauty?
Leonardo da Vinci said that a
a painting is a poem for the eyes.
To me, this land is a poem, Merisi.
Hungary stretches from Moravia
all the way down
to the Adriatic Sea.
I own third of the country.
Which is more land
than the king has.
16 castles, thousands of servants
and 20 times more animals.
-And those deer?  -Belong to Thurzo.
a friend of the family.
Ferenc gave him this land,
but he always wants more.
Now he wants my lakes.
A charming man.
But hi slicks around me
like a dog on feed.
You will be in haven this day, my men!
The lord will avenge us.
-Courage, men!  -For God and Hungary!
You´re lucky the have no idea
who you are.
For God and Hun ...
-What did he say?
-What is our turn tomorrow.
Hey!
a message from my uncle,
Prince of Transylvania.
Bad news?
My uncle Sigmund has invited me
to his birthday.
I have work for you.
Andiamo.
Wait here.
It took ten year of marriage,
before I had my first child.
It was a girl.
But the boy I lost,
would be called Andrasz.
I want you to paint him.
But you must be quick.
We will travel to Transylvania  tomorrow.
No can do it  one night only.
Oh, Madonna mia!
I want to return him to the earth
where he belongs.
Use both hands.
Carefully, Ferenc.
Who is there?  Erika?
Why Dio!
Dio mio!
Christ!
You saved my life.  Thank you.
I won´t forget it.
Your hand.
It´s an honour  commander.
There must be stables near by.
Count Nadasdy will be angry.
I haven´t finished your painting yet.
One you haven´t finished.
The other you have burned.
What will I do with you?
I´ll give you away ...
to my uncle.
I´m not a slave, you just give away!
When do you get it?
Your faith is in my hands
you´re the spoils of war.
Nothing less than a slave.
Slave, slave, slave!  Trophy!
Erzsebet, good to see you!
GYULAFEHRVR  MAJOR TRANSYLVANIA
Uncle Sigmund.
Count Bethlen,  my right arm.
I think I remember  his nephew, Gabor.
Gabor.
Now that the Transylvania joined
the war against the Turks,
we need new blood.
You became very handsome.
You get better  every
day, Aunt Erzsebet.
But the Bathorys have hot and wild blood
running through their veins.
Uncle Miklos,  when he was bishop,
he killed more men than
all Turks together.
Cardinal Andrasz Bathory,
a true saint.
Was ashamed of  he beheaded four.
Great aunt Arnica Bathory.
As the Vikings,  she believed
stay young  beautiful forever
if your soul  purify in fire
and incorporate  in another body.
She got what she wanted,  when
he burned her castle.
And now, the most charming
niece of the prince ...
The woman, whose beauty and youth
seem eternal.
A woman richer  than
all of us together.
Brings us a delightful gift:
a painter from Milan.
Music!
Sigmund - profile!
Excellent!
The best on earth!
Prince of Transylvania!
-Yes!  -No, no, no.
Fox!
Too boring  for you, Erzsebet?
Thurzo?  Where is Ferenc?
The war is a priority
for him, as usual.
Do we play chess  or dance?
Battle-or hug?  -Definitely, battle.
Ferenc sent in  any news?
He sent gifts to his uncle,  and
sent me to entertain you.
Then, entertain me.
Who wins,  chooses the dance.
You don´t like me Ersebeth, do you?
I always wanted a woman
as smart as you.
women more attractive  all Hungary.
A smart woman can be a problem
in the life of her husband.
The knight!
Watch your king.
I can´t concentrate on  this
with Italian Clown watching.
If I were your husband,
I would castrate him.
Clown? Complete game  for me, Merisi.
Certainly.
Checkmate, Mr. Thurzo!
Should spend more time
practising chess
than going behind  my set up.
Wait, Countess!
I forgot to say  something
about Ferenc.
Thurzo an idiot.  That pig messed up.
That pig saved  the life of Ferenc.
That´s what he says. But I don´t believe him.
Stay awhile, Erzsebet.
I´ve been looking forward to see you.
My husband and wounded
and  I stay with him.
I am sorry.  Thanks for everything.
Gotta go.
I must go to Sarvar.
We will meet at home, little angels.
SARVAR  WEST HUNGARY
The count is in Pressburg
by order of King Rudolph.
-And the wounds that he had?
His wounds have healed.
Haven´t even cleaned the room,
lazy loafers.
I want every maid in this castle
whipped.
I am lonely, Merisi.
I miss tenderness.
Kiss me.
Its an order!
I never kissed a woman.
Then this shall be your first time.
Paint me.
You have the eyes and smile
of Da Vincis Mona Lisa.
I´ve never been in love.
When I was studying painting,
I met a beautiful young man.
His name was Luca.
He became my model.
It was a passion for  his
his physical perfection.
It was not love.
You must keep this  only in your mind.
You have the same brand
as you aunt Arnica.
-Are you afraid of aging?  -No.
It is the law of God.
Everything must grow old.
-Except the faces in the paintings.
A painting preserves
what time destroys.
People will admire
your pale beauty
long after you will leave this world.
I´m pale because  I´m ill.
There´s something
wrong in my blood.
Sometimes I hear a rolling inside my head,
as if the sea were calling to me.
I feel death in my bones.
But no one should know
not even Ferenc.
-Do you love your husband?
-No.
Marriage is something about love.
Alarm!  Alarm!
Ficzko, what was that?
A man spying.
But ran away.
It all to clear was is in this town.
A vampire.  Let us pray.
No, their not teeth marks.
Take the body to the castle.
This my gift for you.
So you can paint like
masters of Florence.
I can´t do it.
You said you wanted to understand
the human body.
Its like...
It feels like murder.
Let do it together.
I am afraid, Merisi.
The Countess is a vampire.
If we don´t run away,
she´ll kill us and drink our blood.
Come with me.
God, please help me!
No!
How it is when a  man loves a man?
The same as when you love a woman.
Out, Merisi!
I want to see if you are a full man.
Out!
Undress now!
&quot;I understand&quot; Countess.
I understand, Countess.
I am a handsome man, no?
I understand.
-Go!  -No! No!
-No!  -Bye, Merisi!
I swear!
I will only make love to women from now on.
Did you know that your behind
is prettier than your face?
I know!  I know!
You were running away
because of Istvan?
Every night that pig
try to get into my room.
So you killed him?
I didn´t kill him.
Don´t you dare lie to me!
I saw the wounds! From the dagger
I gave to you defend yourself.
Put out your hands.
Both.
Where did you get that ring?
Where did you get that ring?
-Where did you get that ring?
Merisi!
Your bitch  Liar and bitch
- He´s obsessed with me!  -Liar!
He comes to me every night!
He begged me to ran away with him.
-No!  -I wish you dead!
No!
No!
Please, God, forgive me
I didn´t mean this to happen.
Oh, God!
Leave me alone!
Out!  Ficzko! Out! Everyone!
Go! Out!
I haven´t seen you for five days.
Why are you avoiding me?
You betrayed me.
I couldn´t betray you.
I love you.
Liar!
-Wait, please.
-You´re a liar!
You´re right, I lied.
I´m not who you think I am.
Go!
I am not as innocent as I appear.
A year ago I killed a man.
Knifed him in the heart, in a duel,
so I had to flee my home.
The Turks took me on the way to Vienna.
And then your husband ...
Merisi my real name.
But I sign my paintings
as Caravaggio.
Caravaggio?
I thought the only thing  important
for me was the painting.
But the only thing
I can´t live without ...
is you.
Run to your room.
Ferenc is back.
Fast!
I´m not going anywhere.
-Ficzko!
If Ferenc finds you here,
he´ll kill you.
Ficzko!
Yes!
Where´s your mistress?
He hasn´t left her chamber
for three days.
Three days?
Is she sick?
My god.
Since when the husband enters
his wife´s bedroom through the window?
Since they can not live without them.
I´ve been so lonely, Ferenc.
Archduke Mathias,  brother
of King Rudolph
has honoured us with his visit.
Let him wait.
Why are you crying?
Come.
My painter did it?
I want you to send him away.
Send him away, Ferenc.
Please.
I don´t want to see him again.
Archduke Mathias is having fun.
But Ferenc, you should
be more at his side.
I hate to rush,
My throne will wait for me.
That is my philosophy.
Bravo!
I don´t understand.
Erzsebet is drunk.
She never gets drunk.
She having fun.
That´s not a sin?
That Italian prick is wearing
her favourite ring.
How did you get it?
Did I tell you?
About our visit in Transylvania.
They spent the night in the
Sarvar, on the way home.
I will kill him.  -Wait!
In front of the kings brother?
I don´t care.
Leave it to me.
He wants freedom.  Why not give him?
Come here, painter!
I have a  reward for you.
Drink!  You´ll be a free man again.
To your freedom, painter.
- Freedom!
- Freedom!
Erzsebet!
Don´t touch her!
Go!
Water!  Send for the old healer!
Did you hear what I said?
Send for Darvulia!
She´s a witch!
-I don´t care if she´s the devil incarnated!
I have to save my wife.
Open your eyes.
Leave the darkness,
come to the light.
Welcome back to the world, Countess.
Who is she?
A healer.  And a seer.
Darvulia.
Caravaggio?
Where is he?
The count ordered his prison,
a week ago.
Drink it.
Merisi?
Merisi is not here.
The rats have eaten his bones?
No, he´s alive.
Do you feel it?
A draft ...
He escaped.
He didn´t even wait
to see if I lived.
I know why you hear
the roar of the sea.
You are ill,
but I can cure you.
I know the secret
of healthy blood.
And more!
My medicine will keep you as young and beautiful
as you are in the painting.
But you have to  make a sacrifice.
Love ...
and reputation.
You will give birth to Ference´s son,
and for ten years you will live
a happy and full life.
And?
See for your self...
I will show you evil that
you can´t avoid without my help.
The time will come when
you must choose for yourself.
Who is this man?
Your enemy,
paving  your way to hell.
Before I die I will write
his name on the wall
in my own blood.
Part II:  Darvulia
TEN YEARS AFTER
There is only one god,
yet people keep dying
in this war against the Muslims
But neither live the Christians
in peace with one another
When The Green Reaper increased
his toll on the battlefield.
His eminence,  Cardinal Forgach
sent me on a secret mission
to upper Hungary.
Rumours from Cachtice spread
throughout the kingdom.
That its wealthiest noble woman
was under the spell of and old seer
named Darvulia her black
magic with blood.
Helped by a young novice
called Cyril
seek to discover truth of this
bastion of Protestant believe
became a focus  of forces of evil.
Cyril, we must give them a hand.
Start bringing water.
I can´t believe it.
Our own soldiers
kidnapping our servants
and selling them
to the Turks,  as slaves.
Lift me up, mommy.  I want to see.
We´ll be safe.
They won´t dare attack the castle.
It was a mistake to postpone
our marriage.
Darvulia said the stars don´t favour it.
We discussed this  often, Anna.
I´m glad, lord Zrinyl
will be joining us,
but not in time of war.
It would be inappropriate.
Why do you always do  what
that old witch says?
Because she saved me from death.
Only Darvulia found the cure
for my illness.
Now that is enough.
You´re nothing but a laughing stock, mother
Everyone knows that you leave her here,
so you can stay young.
I´ll kill you.
Stop!
Sara, stop!
You´re good with the hands.
I was a wood cutter before
I became a monk.
And you?
When are getting married, Lucia?
When she saved for a good dowry.
Next week,  she will work in the castle.
Yes, yes, mother!
Christian brother.
I´m Father Peter.
This Cyril, a Novice.
My name is Ponicky,  am the new pastor.
What brings you here?
The Church is making a map
of Upper Hungary.
You´ll find this a strange place.
Ever since the old hag the witch Countess Erzsebeth
castle maid keep dying one after another.
Is it the plague?
Plague ...
God save you!
God save you!
Where the devil can´t go,
he sends a catholic.
Out of the way.
-Another body!
Darvulia.
We have the chance to send the
first message to the monastery.
A body.
Father, I hope that next time
it´s not yours!
The Cardinal was right
to send us here.
Write what I say.
Countess Bathorys male servant Adreovic
buried bodies in the garden.
The plague with a blade...
Death and blood surrounds me,
another made is now gone.
I´m afraid,  dear Ferenc.
Our daughter seem quite eager to marry.
Soon, I will be even more alone.
I praise god that Pal is still to young
and that I have the faithful
Darvulia by my side.
Always think of those that I miss.
Her potion a herbs a curing me.
It is a miracle.
We pray together for God
to help you defeat the Turks
a have you return
safely home to me.
This war against the Turks
lasts more than 10 years.
Only God  knows
when it will end.
Praise be to God that
all of you will be safe.
I count the days until
we can be together, my love.
Your Black bey.
Buda Castle
For Hungary!
Win!
Thurzo, my brother, watch my back!
Black bey, black bey!
-Easy!  Conceal-gold! Hurry!
Where is the gold?
My gold.  -Get out.
For Hungary!
What is it?
Death is here.
My lord ...
its turned black.
Go to the Countess, Lucia.
Tell her to prepare  for
a trip to Sarvar.
Ferenc!  Ferenc!
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Help!
You scared us.
When I grow up, I´ll be like you, Father!
I promise
In the spring you´ll
have  a real horse.
Now go
Erzsebet.
Yes?
Be careful.
The Habsburgs are attempting
to  destroy Hungary.
There will be traitors when the time comes.
Protect yourself.
Join forces with Bathany.
Why?
Because I trust him.
Marry Pal to their family,
or get married yourself.
Our swords  will protect us.
Viva!
SARVAR, 1604
Come, noble gentlemen
of this proud land.
We will provide our  ultimate tributes
who so bravely took the stabs.
He fought the Turks,  as the dreaded
black bey.
He fought for Christ until his death.
His ear is frost bitten.
S God knows what witches did to him.
Message!  Message!
Cardinal Forgach!
Your Eminence,  message for you.
Thank you.
Erzsebet, we need to talk.
I know this is not a  good time for you,
but when I helped  Ferenc to flee,
he promised me the lakes
in the west of my states.
He wanted to make sure that there
will be no problems with that.
It is no mention of this in his will.
I hope you won´t doubt
the word of a soldier.
Please.
I´m only claiming what's mine.
Find another to steal from.
Don´t think you can fool me
like you fooled Ferenc.
He never knew what
happened in Sarvar.
How many times that Italian
 painter and you slept,
while he was protecting his country.
How dare you?
How dare you?
I´ll think that is a little piece of foreplay.
You bastard!
Dirty piece of scum.
You pig, run to your
Habsburg friends!
She will soon give me what's mine.
I will protect you,
aunt Erzsebet.
When I become prince
of Transylvania,
I can crush anyone,
even the king.
Sir, we have to go.  -Yes.
Almost forgot, I have
a letter for you.
Thank you, Gabor.
Caravaggio.
He´s alive.
Madame. Hey!
May I come in, my lord?
It seems you've lost
sleep over her wealth.
She started the game,
she can´t win.
She must give you what's yours
The bitch.
Let me join this game.
I can be very useful.
I can turn Darvulia.
You´re more useful
giving birth to my children.
And don´t forget: I know herbs
that can turn even Popes black.
Don´t play with fire.
You could lose your head.
Don´t worry
no one will suspect me
or you.
We found her on the road
near the manor house
Some monster  cut off her head.
And your family crest is carved
in her chest.
Are any of your maids missing?
Not that I know of.
