The American taxpayers
have bailed out
financial institutions
of the united
states of America.
The financial
institutions of the.
United States of America
have taken back
the sweat and the blood
of the American people
by taking away their homes by
throwing families right
out into the streets,
destroying the most sacred
thing of the Americans
which is their home,
which represents family.
I can't understand why congress
and why the
financial institutions
have allowed
this to perpetuate.
It's a crime, it's a disease
that should never have attacked.
American families here
in the United States.
I will never, as long
as I live, as a leader,
comprehend why, the
hand that feeds you,
you have bitten it.
You have taken a
bite out of the heart
and the soul of
the American people.
And I am, as an American,
extremely disillusioned..
Disillusioned of these aspects
of the American
wall street culture
where they eat their own.
I will, as a
leader, never, ever
allow this to perpetuate again.
Mr. Ryan, have a seat, please.
Sorry to call you at
such an ungodly hour,
but I like to start early.
The early bird gets the worm,
you know how that goes.
So, Mr. Ryan...
Give me one minute.
I'm going to make a call, okay?
I'll be right with you.
Absolutely.
Jimmy... Jimmy.
Angie... Angie, go back to bed.
It's early.
Jimmy, the phone,

Let it go to voice-mail,
Angie, please.
Jimmy, it's 5:55
in the morning.
I don't give a who it is.
Leave me alone, Angie.
Who the is calling
at 5:55 in the morning?
Angie, go to sleep.
Jimmy...
Ah, voice-mail.
Let me try again.
Jimmy! Get the phone!
Angie, didn't I tell you
never to pinch me?
I can't stand it.
Who is it?
Angie, I just picked
up the phone.
How am I gonna know who it is?
I want to know who it is.
Let me find out,
let me talk to the person.
And then I will tell you.
Hello?
Mr. valenti, sorry to call you
at such an ungodly hour, but...
It's Gerry Gaci from
the Burman Bank.
Yes, Mr. Gaci?
Did I wake you?
No, no, I've been up for hours.
I went jogging, I
played a round of golf
and I'm getting a pedicure.
It's 5:55, what do
you think I'm doing?
Ha ha ha, Mr. valenti,
you have a transfer
of eight million
dollars coming in.
I need you to verify
these funds.
Can my cfo come down and
sign those papers?
I'm sorry, sir, but we
need you, as president,
to verify such a
large transaction.
You can come in
any time the next
six or seven days.
What do you say?
Okay, I'll come down Friday.
Thank you very much.
I look forward to
meeting with you.
Thank you, bye.
It's the bank.
There's this transfer coming
and they want me
to go in and sign.
Right now?
He's a moron, what do you want?
I'm gonna call, uh...
Go to sleep.
Jimmy!
Jimmy, you okay? What's up?
You're sleeping?
Uh, no, I been up for hours.
I betcha you're in
your underwear.
Those ripped up boxer shorts.
You got a camera
in my room, Jimmy?
No, I don't got a
camera in your room.
Listen, Benny...
I want to go back
to bed so shut up
and let me tell you
what I gotta tell you.
The bank called me and
told me that there's a
transfer for about eight
million coming through
and they want me to
go down and sign.
You want me to go in
and do that for you?
No, they told me
I gotta go down
'cause I'm the ceo. New rules.
Yeah, that's the new
justice department stuff
that's going on.
Yeah. Do I got a problem?
No? Everything's good?
Everything's fine,
everything's good.
Okay, go back to bed.
Okay, yeah.
I'm up, but whatever.
Good night.
Okay, good night.
Morning, whatever it is. Bye.
Alright, Mr. Ryan.
This is nothing personal,
but as you're aware
your loan with this
bank for your house
is a demand loan which means
we can demand
payment at any time.
You're aware of this, right?
Now you've always
made your payments,
but you've also always
been delinquent.
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan.
I don't have a choice but
I have to call your loan.
You have seven days to
pay it or we have to
realize on its security,
that's your house.
- My house?
- Your house.
What are you talking about?
My house is where I live
with my family, sir.
I understand that,
and you have complete
empathy and
understanding from me.
But I work for a bank,
the bank is run by a board.
All I can do is answer to them
and they want their
payments on your house.
If you don't pay, they
will take your house.
It's as simple as that.
It is not personal,
it is not me.
It is my job to inform you.
How can I not
take it personally?
You're talking about
taking my home
where I live with
my wife and kid!
No, I am not taking your home.
What I am doing is
informing you of the fact
that if you don't
make your payments
my bank will
repossess your home.
It's just the way it is,
Mr. Ryan. I am sorry.
Angie...
Jimmy!
What are you doing?
Jimmy, why are you
wearing that?
I picked a suit for you.
I love this suit on you.
Maybe you should wear it
because I'm wearing this.
I'm going to lunch, I'm
gonna be a few hours
and I'm gonna take
the Mercedes, okay?
No, honey, I want
you to stay here.
Stay, we can hang out
like we used to.
Come on, we'll go to lunch.
Angie...
We'll have a nice day,
we'll go shopping.
Angie, I got some stuff
to do, okay, hon?
What stuff do you gotta do?
Angie, I'll be back in a
couple of hours, okay?
Why don't you get some sleep?
You woke me up early enough.
You think I'm gonna
forget that pinch?
You're not going to
kiss me goodbye?
Stupid of me,
what am I thinkin'?
See ya tonight. Okay?
Ciao, Bella.
Mickey...
! Mickey!
Mickey, the baby's been crying.
Could you just get up?
I got it.
Sonny, baby. Daddy's coming.
I'm coming, son.
Hey, how are you, my son?
Can you keep it down?!
Mr. valenti.
Good morning.
Good morning, Richie.
Nice to see you.
The car's out front.
I didn't have time to wash it.
No big deal. We're good.
Have a good day, buddy.
You too.
Thank you. See you tonight.
'Morning, daddy.
Atta boy.
Hey, how does
mommy look at you?
Hello?
Hey.
I'll be there in
about 15 minutes.
A lot of traffic,
I'm cutting through.
I'm coming down
along the water.
Don't go nuts ordering
a bunch of stuff.
I'm not going to eat
heavy for lunch.
I'm taking Angie to
dinner at that new place.
I don't want to eat two
good meals in one day.
Then I gotta run for a
week to lose one pound.
Ha ha, I'm at that stage now.
I'm almost there.
God bless you.
Jimmy!
Jimmy!
Didn't I tell you
guys to order light?
How you doing, buddy?
Good. How much is a
hotdog and drink?
That'll be four bucks.
How much for just a hotdog?
Three bucks.
Gimme a hotdog.
I know you!
Mickey... Mickey Ryan.
From Alfie's bar.
Oh!
Buddy, you okay?
Come on.
Look like you fell down,
you can't get up.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said.
I didn't mean anything by it.
You okay, bud? You
look like you got the
weight of the world
on your shoulders.
I'm fine. Sorry about the-
you sure you're gonna be okay?
Anything I can do for you?
Good luck, bud.
Hey, you got room for one?
I got room for no
less than one, baby.
Have a good day.
Good morning, Mr. valenti.
Here are your messages.
Thank you.
Richie, what are
you doing here?
I feel bad about
not getting your car
cleaned up. Can I do it now?
Come on, rich.
It's no big deal.
Please, it'll just
take me a few minutes.
Rich, I got a board
meeting upstairs.
If it's not ready my
wife's gonna kill me.
I understand.
- You sure?
- I promise.
Okay, buddy.
So bring it down here, okay?
For sure.
Thanks.
She's already called six times.
Good morning, Mr. valenti.
Good morning.
Coffee, Mr. valenti?
Uh, not really. You know what?
I didn't sleep much last night.
I'll have one of those -
is that yours?
No, I got it for you.
Thanks.
Benny's waiting in the
boardroom for you
right now.
I gotta make sure I'm out
of here in 30 minutes.
My wife's already called
three million times.
Talk about being obsessive.
So I just want to
make it a quick thing.
Is the agenda all ready?
It's all ready for you.
Jimmy, how are you?
Good. Gentlemen, good morning.
'Morning.
So you got everything
on the bank?
I do.
Thanks Benny.
Hang on.
Let's sit down and we'll
get everything organized.
Okay, so, explain to
me, if you don't mind,
why we're going down there
to verify this on Friday.
Well, basically,
a customer sends
us the money...
They were supposed to
verify it with the bank,
they didn't, and then we
should have verified it.
So it kind of is our
mistake but since it's
a transfer of a good
amount of money
the bank shouldn't have
any problems with it.
And I could go down there
with you if you'd like.
No, I'm good.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Don't reprimand the
people in accounting,
okay? It's not a big deal.
And I should go
down there anyways.
So this is standard
practice now?
It's becoming.
So then send a memo
to everybody, Benny.
Alright, will do.
And tell everybody that
it's standard practice
that they need to detail
any foreign transfers
of their account. Okay?
Okay.
What do you got for me, Dave?
Top of the list is charitable.
The new Brooklyn
hospital fundraiser.
We can opt in at three levels:
Silver, gold, and platinum
at $50,000 or
$100,000 or $250,000.
Understanding how you roll and-
what's the money for?
Like, is it going
straight to charity?
'Cause you know when we
give money to charities
we want to make sure
80% or 90% goes directly
not to the administration,
you know, I want it
to go to the charity.
Already taken
care of that for you.
Buddy, you do a great job.
That's why you do that job.
I just want to make sure.
So what's this for?
This is brand new care
units for the hospital.
We have new equipment
coming in, um,
all with your approval
from our meeting
about six months ago.
Okay, do it. Is
there anything else?
No, understanding
how you roll, I know
this is important
to you, I've already
begun the paperwork
on the platinum level,
with your permission of course.
So get Benny to sign
off on it and that's it.
Roger that.
Excuse me, detectives?
The chief would like to see you
in his office immediately.
He's been looking for
you for the past hour.
Tell him we already left.
Sorry, I can't do that.
Yeah? You're a.
Thank you, sir.
- You.
- Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
Chief, you wanted to see us?
Oh, I'm glad I wasn't on fire.
Where the hell were you guys?
Sorry, chief.
We were in finger printing.
And having a quick coffee.
That's splendid.
Here's the bullet...
The city is coming apart.
I need to pull
you off vacation.
I need another shift from you.
Chief, you're looking at
the walking dead here.
We worked 48 hours straight.
You're not looking at tired,
you're looking at exhausted.
Yeah, we've gone straight
on the fox case, alright?
Three straight
days, 20 hour days.
We need a day off!
You deserve a
day off, but look.
The media's all over
me on the fox case,
we got a convention
in town which means
we got 50 Romanian pickpockets.
We got a protest tomorrow...
What protest?
A protest, I don't know.
Look, give me a
break on the shift
I'll give you a vacation Vig.
Oh, come on. You've
been saying that
for 15 years, chief!
You owe us about
ten years' vacation!
Tony, you haven't been
here 15 years.
Listen...
You guys are the
cream in my milk.
Don't leave me with
the morons, please?
I know you got a union,
you could bust my balls
but I'm talking to you
as a cop who came up
through the ranks
just like you did.
The city needs it, I need it.
Can you help me out?
I'm going home.
I can't stand my own skin.
I gotta take a shower,
I've got ass swamp.
What's ass swamp?
It's not good.
Take a shower and come back.
Go on, get outta here.
Ass swamp...?
- Did you call a cab?
- Yes.
- Is this yours?
- Yes.
I want to stay with you, daddy.
Take a good look at
him 'cause that's the
last time you're
gonna ever see him.
You finally did it.
You lost everything
and he will not grow up
to be a loser like you.
Forget it!
Mickey.
Hey, Alfie.
How are you, kid?
I've had better days.
Yeah, I know all about it.
Listen, I'm gonna
set you up today.
On me, alright?
Go ahead, kid.
You know what really
breaks my heart?
Losing my kid.
You'll get him back.
That kid loves you.
What's he think of me?
He'll think good of you
'cause he loves you.
Don't you worry.
How you doing?
Heard about your situation.
I got a funny joke for you.
Two Jews walk into a bar...
And they buy it.
Pretty sad in this day and age
they can get away
with things like that.
Who said anything about Jews?
You know, I miss a few
payments I lose my house.
You think that's why you
lost your house?
Huh? It wasn't Monday,
it wasn't Wednesday,
but Jewsday.
That's the day they
take things from you,
you understand that?
You lost your
house because those
kike wanted to take your house
and that's why
they have it now.
Don't ever forget that.
Listen, I just wanted to have
a drink with my friend, okay?
You want our help?
We know how to handle
those lampshades.
We know how to
handle 'em real good.
Don't get involved with
those whackjobs.
It's a really bad idea.
B-59.
0-71.
Ah,.
Can't even find the damn thing.
Ladies...
N-38.
Ma, can I talk to you a second?
Sweetie, there's no
breast milk here.
It dried up a long time ago.
Why do you talk like that?
You're talking to her son.
Oh, that's rude.
What do you want?
Ma...
What? What?
I really gotta talk to you.
I'm about to win!
Honey, we have a lot of
money invested in this,
so could you come back later?
Ma, it'll just take a minute.
Just go outside with
me for a second.
Can I have a cigarette?
Thank you.
Come outside, okay?
Hurry back.
Yeah, I will.
Loser.
She has to try to help her son.
I had a son.
He was a heroin addict
and he couldn't help himself.
And I tried every
way to help him.
He tried too,
but he couldn't...
He committed suicide...
And I don't have him anymore.
I can't help him anymore.
But she can.
She's a mother to this boy.
She's got to help him.
Don't let him go
the way my son went.
Now what do you want? Hm?
Ma, I'm in bad shape.
I lost my kid.
I gotta get my kid back, okay?
I need some help.
What do you want
me to do about it?
I know all of this stuff,
the whole town knows
all of this stuff.
Ma, I'm trying to
get my kid back.
I got nowhere else to go.
You're the only one that I-
you're all I got, ma.
I just need a little help.
Listen! You're the one that's
supposed to be
taking care of me!
I'm your mother!
I gave you everything I had!
I gave you everything
you and your-
I do that, mom!
I have been taking care of you,
I've paid your rent, I
bought your furniture!
I need a break
here! Help me out!
I can't help you out!
I got nothin' to give you.
I mean, this is crazy!
You should be taking
care of me all the time!
I have nothing left.
I got nothing.
I lost my house, I lost
my wife, I lost my kid.
I just need a break.
Help me out a little bit.
You and your brother
drive me crazy.
You're just like your
father - no balls.
So grow a pair! Okay?
I-22.
Know what happens when I
put my card in the atm?
"Insufficient funds".
Just call me
"insufficient funds".
These kids now, I tell ya.
You've got to help your son.
You must help him,
he needs help.
Don't let him go like that.
I know what I'm talking about.
I did that with my
son, and I lost him.
My son committed suicide.
Ohhh.
Hey, Mickey.
I brought you a blanket.
You need some
pillows or something?
No, I'm good. Thanks.
Okay.
It's great having you here.
Great having you.
Thanks Joe.

Don't worry... Daddy loves you.
Joe?
Yeah, sweetie?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, what is it?
When the did we
buy a hotel franchise?
What are you talking
about, sweetie?
Our living room is now like a
super 8 motel
where your stinkin'
of a brother is probably
jerking off on my couch.
Shh, he'll hear you.
Who gives a about
what he has to say?
I want him out of here.
I can't stand the guy.
He's a loser!
Look, he put us up when
we didn't have any money.
He put us up in his house,
he bought groceries.
My mom didn't do that.
I can't ask him to leave!
Yes, you can ask him to leave.
By tomorrow morning you
tell that loser
to get the out.
And you know what?
You know what I think?
You can get out with him too.
What are you looking at?
Hey, Mickey. You're up early.
Joey.
Get dressed, I'll make
you a coffee, alright?
Uh, Mickey, can I talk
to you for a second?
What's up?
Well, you know, the
house is small, right?
You can't be comfortable
on the couch like that
and, you know, I was thinking,
and Julia was
thinking too, that...
What are you saying, Joey?
Well, you know...
Wait a minute. I fed
you guys for two years.
You stayed at my
house for two years.
I didn't charge you anything.
Nothing. What are you doing?
I got some money for you.
Are you throwing me out?
One night I'm here and
you're throwing me out?
Mickey, it's not like that.
What, you're gonna pay me

Stop!
Nss breaking news,
I'm Tony Ambrogio.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a very
disturbing, frightening
and tense situation
developing right now.
The Burman bank of
Brooklyn is under siege
and unfortunately police
are not releasing details
at all.
Our news team is on the scene
led by our lead
reporter Perry Lefko.
This is a very
disturbing, frightening,
tense, and quite frankly
a frightening situation
is developing at this time.
We'll hear from doctor
Georgina Cannon in a few
moments to hear what
possesses people to do
these types of horrific
acts that are happening
right now at the Burman
bank of Brooklyn.
With more, let's turn now
to our lead reporter,
Perry Lefko.
Perry, describe the scene
for us if you can.
Tony, I'm standing at
location right now.
It's total pandemonium.
It's taken me 45 minutes
to walk just five feet.
People are being drawn to this
for reasons I can't understand.
All we know at
this point is that
there's three
perpetrators inside.
We don't have much
information, although
we've heard that one
customer has his cell
phone on and from what
we've heard there have
been some derogatory
remarks made towards one
of the people in there,
an anti-judaism remark.
It's very scary, I can't
begin to tell you.
I've talked to a
lot of my sources.
We're not getting a
lot of information.
People are tight-lipped.
I've talked to
the chief of police.
He doesn't want
anything to do with me.
So, you know, I'm Jewish
and this thing
bothers me a lot.
I've never seen
anything like this
in all my years of
reporting, Tony.
It is scary, it is frightening
and it is personally sad.
It's a sad statement on
the state of humanity.
We just arrived
live on location.
We're not sure what
the problem is but the.
Burman bank seems to
be totally under siege.
We have no
confirmed reports yet
but there were shots
fired, and we're
not sure if anybody
has been injured
but we'll keep our
eye on the situation.
But it is just
total chaos here.
As you can see behind me,
SWAT teams and NYPD are here.
I'm Gary gamble, Jewel radio.
What kind of evil men are you?
Shut the up, old man.
You don't scare me.
I've seen the devil,
and you are nothing.
You should be
ashamed of yourself.
Oh, yeah, old man?
You hit like a girl.
Stop. Please.
Shut up!
You want to see me
hit a girl, old man?
Oh,.
Now listen, this is ludicrous.
You're letting a moron
hold us hostage.
We have the power.
You gonna go in there
and shoot everybody?
I'm gonna take over here,
and if I take over
we're gonna be gone and
home by supper time.
Hey, Ralph...
Ralph, come here.
You got no business being here.
I haven't called for
the SWAT team yet.
I got certain business
here and I don't like a
guy like that from
his rank telling me-
this is my rank, which
is chief of police
so stand down.
I remember when
you became chief.
Please, stand down.
Thanks fellas.
Jesus Christ.
No, please..
You a tough guy now?
Hey, hey, hey.
Stop! What are you guys doing?!
Stop! Stop!
What are you doing?
Jesus!
Come on, man.
You're alright, get up.
Hey.
Jesus Christ.
Hey, you're that guy...
You're that guy who
helped me the other day
when I fell.
Yeah.
Hey, you're not Jewish.
What are you doing?
Get outta here.
Go, get outta here.
Come on. You don't belong here.
I don't think I
can do that, man.
It's nice of you, but...
Tomorrow I'd wake
up with no balls.
I'm gonna stick
around for the ride.
Chill out, guys. Come on.
Let me talk to
you for a minute.
Come here.
We're not here to do this!
These guys gonna be okay
with those people?
Welcome back to nss.
I'm Tony Ambrogio joined now by.
Dr. Georgina Cannon.
We're all aware of
the horrific situation
developing right now at the.
Burman bank of Brooklyn.
What, Dr. Cannon, is
going through the minds
of the hostages and their
family outside the bank
watching helplessly?
Well, the hostages
are feeling terror
because they're again
losing a sense of
what they really know.
They're in a bank,
they went there to
I assume make deposits
or withdraw money
or whatever they
went there for.
And this happened like that,
so they're in a place
of absolute terror
and not being in control.
When you lose control
of your environment
all sorts of things can happen.
So the person who's
holding them up
is also feeling the same way
but at a different
point of view.
So they're terrified.
And the families of course
have no knowledge
of what's going on
so they're worried
about their loved ones.
They don't know if
they're alive or dead.
They have no way of knowing.
What's the 411?
Somebody called in
from the main branch
on his cell phone.
- They called us?
- Yeah.
We don't have a phone in there.
No idea how many people.
Do we have eyes in there?
Not that I know of.
We've got nothing.
Trying to get some
information, but nothing.
Hostages?
Could be, probably.
Get all the documents
over the last 30 days.
I can't give you
all the details.
I don't know whether
people are hurt
but I know there's a hostage.
Whoever did this has got some
pissed off reason to do it.
I know, but it's
at least 12 hours
to get a warrant.
We don't need a warrant.
Ralph, you're not authorized
to talk for the department.
This is all off the record.
Stand by with your troops.
When we go in we'll call you.
Thank you for being here.
This is off the record, folks.
You mention no control...
The hostage taker is in
control and I ask that
because as Perry told us
the scene outside there
are a number of law
enforcement officials,
a lot of people, a
lot of pandemonium.
Are the hostage
takers feeling like
they are in control?
They may initially
but after a while
they lose that,
which is why hostage
negotiators are so
brilliant at what they do.
Because they
understand the mind
of the hostage taker.
They understand that
that person started off
being the strong one and
in control but realizing
as the police gather
outside or whatever else
is going on, there's
no way out so
they have to negotiate
their way through.
Chief, no warrants, okay?
Yeah, I don't know,
just don't let
anybody get hurt.
Thank you very much.
What?
The mayor.
Can somebody tell me
what's happening?
Well, we will
when we know, sir.
We know it's a
hostage situation,
we don't know
exactly what's up yet.
We just got here and
you might want to wait
in your car until we can
break some news to you
rather than standing around
with nothing to do.
You might want
to go to a school
and teach the third graders-
you could be fired on the spot!
No, I'm sorry.
You can fire me but
you can't fire him.
I'll brief you as soon
as we know something.
We got a call came
in a half hour ago from
someone using their
cell phone in the bank.
They said there's three
of them in there,
they shot two security
guards. Okay?
Thank you.
They knew I was
lying to them if you knew that.
What the are you doing?
Come on.
Sit down, sit down.
I never been shot before, man.
Can you do me a favor?
Absolutely.
These guys, uh...
Ah,.
These guys always have
a bottle of scotch.
Check out one of the drawers.
Usually it's in the right side.
How'd you know that?
These guys live well.
Johnny Walker blue label.
God bless America.
That's good.
It's bad luck to
cheer with your-
you're gonna have to push over-
it's bad luck to cheer
with your left hand.
Why are you doing this?
It's a suicide mission.
Those guys are whackjobs.
Why are you doing this?
I'm so sorry, man. So sorry.
You don't have
to be sorry to me.
We all, uh...
We all act a
little bit different.
I'm gonna help you.
I got money, I got scratch,
I got a lot of friends.
Let's get out of here.
We'll just walk out of the bank
and I give you my
word of honor...
I give you my word of
honor I'm gonna help you.
I don't give a.
Money's no object.
I'll do my best to defend you.
You haven't hurt anybody.
If you stay here
you're gonna die.
This is a suicide mission.
There's a lot of
innocent people.
So walk out with me.
Our lead reporter Perry Lefko
tells us that one of
the perpetrators,
his name is Mickey Ryan,
he has no criminal past
and is regarded as a good guy.
Right.
Why would a good guy crack?
Well, again, it's lack
of inner resources.
It is something that
is missing in him.
So maybe when he was a kid
he wasn't taught how
to handle trauma or
issues that he didn't
particularly like.
So what's happened is if
he's lost what he knows
for sure, if he's
lost his footing,
then he's going to want
to hurt or have a tantrum.
This is an adult
tantrum, if you like.
I'm not making light of
it but I think that's an
easy way to explain
what's going on.
When there's no inside
resources, when there's
no strength inside you
just explode outward.
I know, right?
Businessman and philanthropist.
Jimmy valenti is
standing inside
the Burman bank in Brooklyn.
He has tried to save
a little girl's life.
Usually when there's
gunmen and hostages
things don't go well
and the police
lose their Patience.
What?
Police are being very
tight-lipped about
the situation so there's
very little information
to go on but it
seems at this point
the police at least
have some control.
Oh, my god.
Don't worry.
Jimmy thinks he's
gotta save the world.
He'll be okay.
Don't tell me about my husband.
You don't know
about my husband.
I know my husband.
I gotta go.
Come on.
Angie...
If you've just
joined us on nss,
the Burman bank of
Brooklyn is under siege.
Few details are being released
but here's what
we can tell you.
Over 100 people are
being held hostage
inside the bank by
three perpetrators.
It is a very tense and
frightening situation.
Aw, Mickey.
I told you to go straight home.
..Who will tell us why
people who have troubles
in their lives are taking
innocent people hostage.
Perry, who's there as
far as law enforcement?
Tony, it's not who's there.
It's who's not there.
Everybody who has
anything to do with
law enforcement is here.
B-4.
I didn't get it again.
Peter shay, Brian
canning and Mickey Ryan.
They're all from New York.
Oh, my god.
That loser son of
yours has got himself
into more.
You're a horror.
You're really heartless,
talking about
her son like that.
Oh, poor baby.
How did you get
yourself into this mess?
Hey, look, you old hag...
Up there, that's my son.
If anyone is gonna be
disrespectful about him
it's gonna be me. Okay?
I'll tear your false teeth out.
I will. I know how.
Oh, my baby boy...
What have I done?
Joe!
Joe, are you in the kitchen?
Yeah, sweetie.
I need some more vodka!
You think you can
handle that, you moron?
Coming!
Hurry up!
Perry, do you know who
the perpetrators are?
You gave us the names.
But do you know who
these people are?
All we know, Tony,
at this point...
Oh, my god.
Your brother's robbing a bank.
Hey! That's my vodka!
I just bought that bottle!
Pick it up!
Shut the up!
I sold my brother out for
and you're nothing but a!
By three perpetrators.
It is a very tense and
frightening situation.
We will come back
after this break.
Mr. Ryan, I'm sorry to
bring you down here
under such tragic circumstances
but we're trying to
help your brother.
We believe he's a good guy.
He's a good guy,
he's a good guy.
It's just bad circumstances.
These are the circumstances
I'm interested in
finding out about.
The family let him
down, I let him down.
How did you let him down?
I just... I...
My wife.
My wife wanted him
out of the house
and I let her do it.
I shouldn't have.
I mean, he's done
so many good things
for a lot of people.
He's done good things,
he's a good guy.
I believe that.
I just went along with
it and I told him to
get out of the house and
I didn't want to do that.
You threw him out of the house?
I threw him out of the house.
I threw him out
of the house, okay?
He got mixed up
with some bad people
because it's not him,
he's a good guy.
He's never been in
any kind of trouble.
He's never done anything.
He's been a good
guy, a good father,
a good husband.
He's had some troubles.
He lost some money.
He lost his job,
he lost his house.
Now he's gonna lose his family.
You gotta help him.
He lost his house?
Yeah. Yeah, he's
lost everything.
He lost his house.
He could lose his
life, I don't know
what's going on
inside that bank.
I need to get in there.
I need to tell
him that he's okay.
You said he lost his house.
Is this the bank that
held the mortgage
to his house?
I think so.
I don't know but I think it is.
I think it's this bank.
I don't know what happened.
He had some kind of
loan and they wanted
the money back and he
doesn't have the money.
So they took the house.
And now it's taken
everything away from him.
His family, his kid.
His wife left him?
His wife left him,
told him he'd never
see the kid again.
What kind of woman does that?
What does that do to a man?
I don't know who
he's fallen in with
but you gotta save him.
I don't know what's happening.
He may be dead in there.
We're gonna save him,
we're gonna save him.
We're doing the
best that we can.
Please.
Everything you
can tell us helps.
I'll do whatever I can,
just tell me what you need.
What do you want?
You're doing it right now.
You've been a great help.
You've been helping
us a great deal.
But I gotta get back
to the scene, okay?
Listen, no... Listen...
Can I come with you?
Can I get in there?
I can't do that.
I'll get you in as
close as I can but
you have to be behind
the police line.
As close as I can get
'cause I gotta
be there for him.
I'll get you as close as I can.
Thanks so much.
You're welcome.
Thank you, detective.
Thank you, Dr. Cannon, so
very much for your time
and for being with us on
such very short notice.
This is a very tense
situation and, you know,
humanity often
surprises me in a
good way but sometimes humanity
surprises us in a very
negative way as well.
What's your name?
Mickey... Mickey Ryan.
Mickey Ryan.
I'm Jimmy valenti.
Good to meet you, Mickey.
Mickey, I'm gonna
tell you something.
I give you my word of honor,
we get the out of here
I'll get you the best
lawyer in the world.
And I'll look after you.
So trust me.
Let's walk out, save
these peoples' lives,
and this'll be just
a bad dream.
Yeah, sure. We'll
walk out of here,
you'll go your way
and I'll go my way:
Straight to hell
which is where I belong now.
You're talking stupid.
Think about it.
Mickey, think about it.
You gave me a pass.
I coulda left.
So what am I
benefitting right now?
I'm talking to you
from the heart.
Not from the mouth,
from the heart,
and I'm telling you...
You know what my
old man used to say?
It's nice to be great
but it's great to be nice.
So I'm gonna be nice.
Even though you
up a $700 shirt.
You and your boys.
So before I bleed to death
let's get the
outta here, me and you.
Okay, my friend? Let's do this.
Grab the gun and
let's go outside.
We'll figure this out.
I'm good, I'm good. Let's go.
Come on! It's about time!
Get the out here.
I'm not doing this anymore.
I don't want to do this.
I just want to go
home, alright?
Let's just quit.
What the are you talking about?
You're one of us.
No, I was never
one of you guys.
I was never one of you guys.
What the is
this guy talking about?
Get on the ground all of you!
Now!
I'm so sorry!
I didn't wanna do this.
I didn't mean this to happen.
The hate, the anger...
Eclipsed my soul.
I'm so sorry you people are-
it's my fault.
I didn't want this to happen.
Come on, guys.
Let's just go home.
I want to go home.
Shut up!

What happened?
These two scumbags
took over the bank.
A civilian took 'em out.
He took 'em out. He
saved us, he's a hero.
We need an ambulance!
We need a stretcher!
Get a stretcher

Get two garbage bags for
those pieces of.
On three - one, two, three.
He's still alive.
Make room for the stretcher.
That civilian saved me.
Chief, I gotta go
on the bus with him.
I'm with ya, I'm with ya.
I'm going to help you, my son.
I'm happy you're still
with us, Mr. valenti.
Don't you dare die on me.
I'm not gonna

without you, okay, buddy?
Can I see Gaci?
Mr. Gaci, can I ask
you for a favor?
Absolutely.
I got a lot of money.
I'm gonna pay off his mortgage.
Give him back
his house, please.
I don't ever want to
be on the wrong side
of a pistol you're pointing.
That's my husband.
Let me through!
My husband.

Is he gonna be okay?
Yeah.
Go with him.
