I do not know...
I do not know if it's something for me.
District heating is like any other heat.
It just gets made little further away.
I can not figure out if it's something for me.
- I have to think about it. 
- Do it. That's fine.
You may contact me if you decide, we have to make a trade.
Yes. Shall we say it?
Want to go home and think about it? Or...?
Sitting here and thinking?
- I love you most. 
- You two...
Why are you standing there?

See to get some clean clothes. We have to go.

And also on fertility.

How about adopting?

- I understand that.
Yeah, but he did not. Seed dur not.
The sperm have no initiative. They do not even try.
- It's too bad for him. 
- I am then on.

- Exactly, Jan. 
- We have no children.
They tend to pop out, even if you did not order them.

Before hell. Then we have the problem.
I do not know whether you can afford to put kids in this world.

- I myself have been a child.
I sucked the life out of my parents. They never came out of his home.
It was good.
I have always said that having children is a choice you will never regret.
And then regret it anyway little every day.
When you get home, Patrick, you should let you sterilize.
If you have children, you andenrangs- citizen in your own home. Left over.
If the wife had to choose, she will always choose his children.
And if the kids had to choose, they would always choose mum.
In time you will be so broken that you think both sides are right.
As a man you are on leave to remain in your own family.
It does not matter that it is you who gives them shelter.
- Women may even provide roof. 
- Exact.
They just do not build shit himself.
- It will be very gender-normative. 
- Thanks.
The gender normative? He's already broken.
Oh, damn!

Well, damn ... Sorry.
It must be damn excuse. It has its own life.

- That's it.
Yes.
I'll see you tomorrow!
Shut up, Adam!

I have. You've always been a little limp.
In their age I could lift cars with my erection.
Did not you have something better to do with it?
"248 pigs killed in Varde."

Customers are illegal party people?
"Plump girl looking chef or køkkencheftil committed relationship."

- Ham, who was married to Helle Virkner. 
- Krag? First name?
- Hans Otto? 
- Hans Otto Krag.
- No, Jens Otto Krag. 
- It is the same.
You know who we mean. Hans-Otto or Jens-Otto.
I said Hans-Otto. His name is Jens-Otto.
- He is dead. He was said. 
- It does not matter. Jens-Otto.
- We had Otto true. 
- His name is Jens-Otto.

Arkansas. Arkansas...
Yes, it is pronounced incorrectly. Arkansaw is the right answer.
- It is true. Arkansaw. 
- Arkansas.
It is an American state. There is not a state called Arkansas.
Arkansaw, dammit. Pronounce it right.
There was one of you, who said Paris with S. Should I say Pari?
- I said Hans, and it was Jens. 
- Its not the same.
- Kind of. 
- Things must be pronounced correctly.
- So there must be a deceases. 
- Gu is then ej one deceases.
Take your defeat on the chin.
- New questions! 
- I love this game.
What Danish song was sung, which was about ...
How do you read slowly. Do not just read what it says?
- I'll take another question. 
- I do not care.
- Do you live still in Copenhagen? 
- I just got back from New York.
- New York?
- Ya.
- Patrick would have a record deal. 
- Holy shit.
- I also do music. 
- Okay? What are you playing?
I play most of my old vinyl records.
But I played in a punk band when I was younger. Or young.
You did? Okay...
- Yes. Can not you see it? 
- No not really...
- Now I work in the district heating industry. 
- Okay. That sounds exciting.
Yes. Yes, dammit.
I am considering getting tattooed a heater across the chest.
Cool. I think clearly, you should. That you'll never regret.
One could get the impression that life does not quite live up to expectations?
It is difficult when you have replaced love life with a pension plan.
- Is that why you were swingers? 
- I can not remember why.
Adam, try to hear
Love is not a straitjacket, it is a life jacket.
Is it a line from one of Patricks songs?
It is supercorny, but it's true.
I've always thought of life as one of those balls with snow inside.
There is a fine house, but there is not a damn if you do not shake the shit.
- What are you doing? 
- Take off your clothes.
Okay.
- Come on, off with the clothes. 
- No, I do not fucking ...
Come on!
See him yearn, feel him now.
All the lost Everything that he'd '
See and be doing about.
Everything was possible before the time it came.
In his heart lives the
A worm who is smiling and calling itself Friend
What daydreaming, hvortiI, where?
What should be undone and with whom?
See him yearn, feel him now
The horizon beckons, dancer and you ...
I think he's waiting.
Venterfor end of you.
He believes that it exists.
The fool believes that they exist.
It is indeed a long time since I've seen one.
Immerse yourself, my friend
Drop a iasso about your dream and pull it
And rip their skins. Immerse yourself.
Immerse yourself, my friend. Ride on the back of your dream.
It takes you to the most beautiful place
And BOLETTE wiII with. Immerse yourself, my friend.
Your son, he looks like you?
No, he looks like thank god her mother.
I think I'm all that he does not want to be.
I also everything that I did not bother to be.
- We need to get home. 
- Yes.
- Have you seen my panties? 
- No. But I want to see them.
Hello...
Well, hell.
Where have you been?
- We've been out running. 
- Yes.
- In three hours? 
- We also little wild.
And so we had difficulty finding the back.
I think I go up to the room. See you later.
- Ingeborg? 
- Yes.
Why do you have your sweater reverse on?
Did I say that?
- Are you drunk? 
- I have smoked a joint.
- You have smoked a joint? 
- Yes.
How real rock'n'roll, huh?
You know, Iris? Our life is...
...as one of those Christmas balls with snow inside.
There is a nice little house and a lovely landskab...
...but there is not a damn thing before you shake it.
Okay good.
Adam, tell me how you want to live your life.
As short as possible if it is to be on these terms.
Should you now disparage our lives because you've been out walking with a little girl?
Why do we live here in Denmark? In a fucking townhouse.
Why we moved not abroad? New York, for example? Just not here.
You have not been to drive out of the couch, and now would you like to travel?
If we were in New York now, we could take on the jazz club. Right now.
If it was Christmas, we could go down and skating at Rockefeller Center.
You can damn not skate. You can barely ride a bike.
Have you ever just a little pang of longing for something else?
You can not live more deflected than we do.
We go to work, pay forsikringer...
...Eat Prozac, get vitamins and fall asleep on the couch in the evening.
When we really need to go to town, so we go in biffen...
...and get us a club sandwich with cucumbers and hold now firmly...
The cucumbers are cut lengthwise!
It really is a high-risk life we ​​have been screwed together.
Youth do not come off. Adam?
No matter how much you rub yourself up to her, you're too old for InterRail.
I must say, Patrick, I did not fucking just saw coming.
I just thought that I would just embrace it all.
And with it all that you mean other men, or what?
- So what? Are you gay, or what? 
- No.
I am bisexual.
Like Bowie. You love damn Bowie.
You yourself said that his ability to eksperimentere...
...with his sexual identity is insanely exciting.
I'm like him. I also David Bowie.
No, you're not fucking David Bowie, Patrick.
Will not you please tell me why you have the jersey reversed on?
- Have not you anything to say? 
- What do you want me to say?
Your apology is a little untrustworthy, if I can find it.
I have nothing to apologize for.
- My conscience is clean. 
- Of course, and completely unused.
You have been unfaithful to me, Adam. In a swinger club.
This is really almost well done. Is she even sexually mature?
We were out to bathe.
And then I must have taken the jersey reversed on afterwards.
Had she's korkbælte with?
- Iris ... 
- Get out of here, Adam.
Give a lift?
- Come on inside. 
- Yes.
- Are you not even in the car? 
- This is Patricia.
I thought we could run away together.
We could run into the abyss together like Thelma and Louise.
- Are you gay? 
- Sometimes.
You are also a musician. They are often bisexual.
Exact. That is it.
Adam played in a punk band when we were young.
Several of them were also bisexual.
Or they wanted it.
- So I can move it? 
- Yes, as long as it is there.
So I think it's me.
- Yes. 
- So I think that happens antics.
Look at her. It is not to know whether to be happy or angry.
- What? 
- Is she a gift or an insult?
Shut up, it is to be completely stupid to look at.
Were you with her when I was out walking?
I would not blame you if you were circumventing the rules. She has to eat.
Ingeborg was also beautiful once.
- She was elite gymnast. She said that? 
- No, I think not.
It is too long ago. Before she was embalmed with anti wrinkle cream.
- Gymnastics does not interest me. 
- The interests hell no.
But she was beautiful then.
She had the country's most well-trimmed body.
And an incomparable, small party bum.
Now sucks her skin of cheese and her morning urine as ammonia.
Yes, yes, I also have my faults. They're fucking not to overlook.
At that point I look like much my wife.
Now do not misunderstand me. I love Ingeborg.
- I just can not keep her out. 
- I sound like a harmonious couple.
Is there harmony in a marriage?
Is there harmony in your marriage?
Or is there just different degrees of lies and dissimulation?
"No, darling, I have not smoked."
"I have not been drinking beer with colleagues."
"No, I did not notice the young blonde with the frenzied chest measurement."
"Was she pretty? It did I not notice. I have eyes for you."
"I worship your gennemsnitlighed...
...and your way to suck the life force out of me. "
"With you it's Monday all week, honey."
At one point orcs not to lie anymore.
So you end up here. In a pragmatic compromise...
...which is just as tragic as the lie was to begin with.
Love is a life jacket, not a straitjacket.
Where the hell did you get that, Adam?
The problem is that both tightens completely mad.
Cool.
So...
...we go then?
I can not find the damn car keys.
- What about my son, if I'm alone? 
- No, it's probably best we get.
Untie the towel around his waist instead of throwing it in the ring.
- Do you play golf? 
- What?
Well ... no.
- Tak for gossip. 
- Yes.
- Then it's shown me. 
- Yes, it's your turn.
- Should not there? 
- Yo.
Small Patricia. Tonight I make sure she does nothing but look.
Tonight is the anaconda a very young fur collar.
Yes!
- Congratulations on the victory 
- Now it's damn our trip.
Come and play some croquet. You sit and rot away, after all.
Well, it was good, got a feel for it. Do I get the stick?
- Yes. The path is yours. 
- It is skidenemt.
Beginner you down here?
Okay. Patricia? You're on my team.
Now, we start.
So it's us, right?
Okay...
Patricia, just try to imagine. If you should encounter for the ball ...
- With both hands, right? 
- With both hands. Take it there.
Imagine that the ball is there. Then chop you.
So hugger I just.
Not too vigorously. Such.
What the hell?
What are you doing?
So I think, we will stop here.
It's a parlor game, not the Olympics.
What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you, Adam?
- What the hell are you doing? 
- Now it was just so fucking nice.
- It was not on purpose. 
- Shut up, an idiot.
What the hell spade? Huge fool.
So there is dessert in five minutes.
Hey. Hello.
- We two will dance. 
- I do not dance. For the sake of all
- Come on, Adam. 
- people worldwide.
Actually I would like to talk to you about something.
I just want to say that I think you should go home.
Okay. It was not particularly friendly said.
- I can easily run you. 
- You can easily run me?
And what do you think, Iris says to that?
I do not know.
I do not know what Iris says. But I know that this place does something to you.
We will soon be down to the basement again. I do not think you should go down there.
- Adam, come on. 
- No, no, Patricia.
You are just so lovely.
You are bursting with optimism. It's so fine.
Your optimism is completely unfounded, because life is short and cruel.
But it does not matter.
You just keep all your illusioner...
...they are so much better than the reality. Believe me.
- Adam...You're pissed. 
- No.
I have drunk five items. Max. 12th
Without a minimum of illusioner...
...there is only cynicism and misanthropy and incomplete grotesque common dance.
Patricia, you can not regain lost innocence.
Adam, I lost my innocence in 8th grade.
You sit and stare at her. Jan, you could be her father!
Now, nej, it may he the not.
His semen is stone cold dead!
Could I have your attention, please?
And if everyone is finished with the lovely trifle ...
It was excellent.
So I think we should move into the cellar.
- Bon appetite! 
- Bravo!
- Should we keep talking, Adam? 
- We come here to ...
- Bully. 
- In order to meet new friends.
- So what, Jan? 
- Hi!
Friends?
And we have done. We have met them and they met us.
- Meetings can be volatile... 
- Goodbye!
Meetings can be permanent.
But we must all remember to behave like decent people.
- Gu I will not! No way. 
- There I agree with George.
Now I think it is time that we go down into the cellar.
But what does it really mean to be human?
Good question.
Anthropological seen.
It is no more than 300,000 years ago that we learned to get up and go.
There I was not even born.
At that time we lived afjorden and animals
- And water. 
- It was good, we did not live then!
- Cheers, George! 
- Cheers, Patricia!
So 300,000 years ago, so by Patricia, it's long...
...So why the hell have we not learned anything from it?
Could we make love just a tiny, tiny, tiny chance?
Exactly. And we go down to the basement and do now, everybody.
Then I say bon appetit...again.
Damn fine speech, Adam. It sat in the closet.
What's wrong?
I want a divorce.
It do not say.
- Thanks. 
- Is there anything I can do for you?
A little oral sex would be great.
- Yes? 
- Yes. Okay.
Vent...
Are you sweet to give them to me?
So.
- Hey, Patrick! 
- Hello, George!
So.
What happens?
Damn it, come on out.
I love you.
Further, on. Out with you!
Hell, where is it cold!
- What the hell is going on? 
- There is no smoke anywhere.
Come out! It burns the hell!
Is everyone here? One two three four five six seven...
- What? Why counts she? 
- ...eight, nine, ten.
Are you okay, everybody? Well, then I go in and check  main building.
There is no beginning to play heroes. Are you with me?
- Hello ?! Is in with? 
- Yes!
Pis ...
Hey!
Hey!
- Could not you sleep? 
- No.
Should we play?
We can do that.
- Okay. 
- Thanks for the game.
You're welcome.
Now, Jorgen. I'll go to bed.
- Can we play a game where I start? 
- Have not I humiliated you enough?
No, I'm in bed. I'm tired. I'll see you tomorrow.
I think you should be here for a while.
All the others are sleeping. We have the entire inn to ourselves.
No, I would like to bed.
- George, please move you. 
- I can not move me.
Can not.
Patricia, what are you doing?
- Adam, give us a minute. 
- What do you mean?
What are you doing?
We lumps, Adam. It's a swinger club this.
Did not you hear what I said in the locker room?
Maybe you two just talk?
- You bastard! 
- Before hell!
What happens? No, now I fucking quit.
Why they stop them?
Beware. So stop in, boys.
- George, calm down. Come on, Adam. 
- Yes, up to bed with you.
Tell them what has happened.
There is no one here who understand a damn thing. Patricia?
Adam, now we go to the room.
Adam, sorry.
So is the end to be pussy minister here!
- Pussy minister? 
- Yes.
- What the hell are you talking about? 
- He's pussy ...
He thinks he's pussy minister.
You're an asshole.
How you looked with Patrick, such as you out even with me.
Back then you were not an asshole.
When we met, there were 50 men like me in the bar. There was only one like you.
I always knew that I continue girl you.
That you would find out that I am a mediocre asshole.
You may well keep them for me. So you can manage them.
Lie on top of me.
You are so stupid.
- Do not like my back? 
- No.
- Off, shit! 
- Come here.
- Does it hurt? 
- Yes.
- Fuck, a bunch of losers, man. 
- Talk properly on other people!
Are you serious?
- It's not okay, you got beaten up. 
- I have not been beaten up, okay?
I will not be in your specialty more.
Fine, Patrick! I will not be writing more about you...
...if you so lets not write more miserable songs about me.
For you. Patricia, I write them damn to you.
Shut up, Patrick!
We can not all go around and be artistic feel teddy bears, right?
I believe in something so insensitive as to take an education.
It may well be that I am not the academy Miker. But you've broken all rules...
...of scientific objectivity.
Wow, that was some big words. Can you write a song about it?
Good night.
The professor's daughter
turns his patter She writes speciale, so the batter
to impress summarizes never see, she's there
She is so ridiculous She is so ...
Stop. Do not! I do not want this anymore!
Yes, it was so cozy. Hi!
Take care?
- Drive safely. 
- That we will.
- I'm damn sorry... 
- It does not matter, Adam.
It seems she's gone tonight. She had enough some ink expense.
People always say that you must follow your dreams, but what we dream about?
Having sex with school girls or shoot the boss with automatic rifle?
It worries me, because it's me who is the boss.
Do not follow your dreams. That's the best advice I can give.
- See you, George. 
- See you, Adam.
Incidentally humping her to hell. It has no any benefit.
I on the other hand was pretty clever. That she does not forget any time soon.
- I can not find the car key. 
- It sits in the ignition.
Jan?
There's something you should know.
- Get home safe! 
- See you later!
- Moves you? 
- No, you do.
It explains why it is my clothes, you pack.
I can not, Adam.
You look like you want to jump out the window every other minute.
I do not want to anymore.
If I jump out of range of the house, I make a dent in the lawn.
That's what you want to jump out of the fucking window!
You look so pisseskuffet out all the time. Also when you look at me.
Have you thought about how it is to live with it?
You belong to a race that seems that, like fort Jener better.
I think you have to have an alibi for having failed.
- Seems like I have failed? 
- No, and I never did.
- Would you like it here with? 
- No. I hate the sweater.
She who Patricia...I felt just a little bit...
...I live again.
Yes. It must then mean that I am dead.
- What is this? 
- It's a flight to New York.
So you can go over and play music, ice skating, or whatever you want.
Happiness is something you create, Adam.
It is not something that exists in a place where you just forgot to look.
There is no return ticket.
- Here you go! 
- Thanks.
What? Is it any funny?
It is only this headline...It's really funny.
- It is funny. 
- Well.
