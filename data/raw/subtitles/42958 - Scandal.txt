You an artist, mister?
Don't I look it?
Lots of artists
come here to paint.
But you're the first
I ever saw come on a motorcycle.
Is that so strange?
Well, it is a little peculiar.
And so is your painting.
Mount Kumotori
looks like it's dancing.
Mountains move.
Huh?
If you look closely enough,
they move.
You're right. It's moving.
Right?
Nonsense!
How can a mountain move?
Do you know
That southern land
Where the trees bear fruit
And the flowers bloom
Where the breeze is -
Anyway, I've never seen
a painting in this style.
Of course it won't look
like anybody else's.
I have my own style.
Do you ask advice
on how to make love to your wife?
That's a good one!
How do I get to Kaminoyu?
Go straight ahead
to the bus route.
Turn north there.
Is it far?
Just a little way.
"A little way" probably
means three miles.
Why didn't you come by bus?
It was three hours
until the next one.
Then leave your suitcase here.
I'll bring it to you later.
I'm staying at Kaminoyu too.
I like it here.
It's too red.
Mount Kumotori ain't that red.
Shut up, old man.
I see it as bright red.
That's how it is
in my mind's eye.
Is that how artists work?
Hey, why don't you wait a while?
I'll give you a lift.
So that's Miyako Saijo,
the famous singer?
Well, I'll be!
She hates being photographed.
Is the guy with her?
No, they took separate rooms.
She says she refuses
to be photographed.
We already know that.
That's why
we need your help -
I did my best.
Please, ask her again.
We can't go back empty-handed.
What a bother!
We may have
to stay overnight.
Is there enough
in the budget?
Excuse me.
Oh, hello!
Thanks for the lift.
You saved me a long walk.
Not at all.
Mind if I come in?
All right, though I'm not
properly dressed.
Neither am I.
Please don't bother.
May I smoke?
- Yes.
Aren't you Miyako Saijo?
I couldn't place you
until I heard the maids gabbing.
You have such big eyes.
I forgot to introduce myself.
Ichiro Aoe. I'm a painter.
Yes, now I remember.
I read about you
in an art magazine.
About my bike?
And how I imitate Vlaminck?
Those writers are all copycats,
so they assume everyone else is too.
What I love about bikes
is that sense of not giving a damn.
It feels good to be rude!
Did you come here
for a little break?
Yes. I've had to deal
with so many annoyances.
That's the price you pay
for being so famous.
It must be tiring
having people gape at you.
It's crowded in the summer,
but now's a good time to be here.
If you have a chance tomorrow,
take a look
at the small marsh nearby.
It's a remarkable green,
at times almost like jade.
Those trees over there -
you see them?
Beyond those dark cedars.
What was that sound?
Sounded like a camera shutter.
Newlyweds, probably.
Separate rooms, eh?
What a scoop!
Hey, boss, how about
some champagne?
It's only a scandal
if he's famous.
If he's just a nobody...
we'll be drinking moonshine.
Well?
They look like they're posing.
The two towels
on the railing are perfect,
like a prop man
hung them there.
What do you think, boss?
Damn it!
I can't stand women
who act all innocent,
then do this
behind closed doors.
But who's the man?
It seems
I've seen him somewhere.
Why didn't you ask
the innkeeper?
We heard he's a painter.
Yeah, some nut
with a motorcycle -
I've got it!
It's Ichiro Aoe.
Aoe? Does that mean
moonshine or champagne?
Champagne!
Print an extra 10,000.
- But -
Have someone write it up:
"Singer and Artist on Romantic Getaway. "
"Love on a Motorcycle!"
But shouldn't we check -
Stop worrying.
It doesn't matter if it's bull -
once it's in print, the public believes it.
Besides,
the picture proves it.
You know what
the idols of the age are?
Photos and the printed word!
AMOUR MAGAZINE
SENSUAL THRILLS
MIYAKO SAIJO'S SECRET LOVE!
IN AMOUR'S DECEMBER ISSUE!
LOVE ON A MOTORCYCLE!
MIYAKO SAIJO'S LOVER REVEALED!
Do you know who the lover
of dramatic singer Miyako Saijo is?
If you want all the news
on this hot topic,
pick up Amour's December issue
before it sells out!
Amour, please.
Sorry, sold out.
Come look!
Ichiro Aoe!
Nisshin Printers?
This is Amour Publications.
Please print another 10,000 copies
of the December issue.
We'll supply the paper.
Yes, thank you.
We're set, boss.
Let's have a big party
at the hot springs.
I'd prefer
my three months' back pay.
Hey, don't be a wet blanket!
You'll get that,
and maybe a bonus too.
Thanks to my trusty Leica.
Why so glum?
- You sure it's safe, boss?
- What?
I mean, it's okay
if we printed the truth -
What? You wrote it!
Only because
you forced me to.
I just made things up.
A love affair's a love affair.
Details don't matter.
What if they complain?
We'll bury an apology
where people won't see it.
- What if they sue?
- We'll sell 10,000 more copies!
Don't be such a pessimist.
This isn't the first scandal
we've covered.
Has anyone sued us yet?
Nobody's even protested.
- I guess not.
- Quit worrying!
The kinds of snobs we target
think the law
is beneath them,
even when they have a case.
They just get self-righteous
and look down on us.
Show me the magazine.
Mr. Aoe?
Please step inside.
Hey, get us some tea!
Tea, sir.
- Who's in charge here?
- I am, sir. Nice to -
ARTIST SLUGS AMOUR PUBLISHER!
I was bowing
when he just hit me without a word.
I'll fight for freedom of the press!
I was wrong
to resort to violence,
but hitting isn't
the only form of violence.
That story was much worse.
It's the modern equivalent
of cutting someone down
on the street!
If you ask me,
Aoe's a sore loser.
I say you reap what you sow.
I regret to say
that I am not Miss Saijo's lover.
The whole story is a lie.
Would I hide
such a beautiful lover?
My motto is,
"Always report the whole truth. "
Is the story true?
One look at that picture
will give you your answer.
Five minutes
after that picture was taken,
I went back to my room
and had two beers.
I had dinner,
bathed, and went to sleep.
That's the entire story.
If Amour refuses
to print a retraction,
I'll sue for damages.
Isn't it odd, though?
Aoe's the only one
making a fuss.
Miyako Saijo
hasn't said a word.
I guess it's true that women
are more honest about love.
Mother, how could you?
I'm sorry, Mr. Aoe.
My own mother doubts us.
She'd rather believe the story
than her own daughter.
- Don't say that!
- You're afraid of what people will say.
I wanted to protest -
You don't understand
how horrible people can be.
You just have to endure it.
How on earth do you expect
to fight sharks like them?
The way I see it,
they're only this bold
because all their victims
have been cowards.
They just drop it,
so the bums keep doing it.
Listen,
we're not living in the jungle.
We live in a modern nation
with modern institutions.
So what do you intend to do?
I'll sue them.
That's crazy!
That never crossed my mind.
We'll be laughingstocks!
No, they'll be
the laughingstocks.
What's the matter?
You know we're right.
Why are you scared to go to court?
You're afraid
of what people will say too?
It's not that.
Then why are you
so against it?
Fine. I'll go it alone.
I won't deny my own feelings
and just laugh it off,
or let society
laugh it off either.
A one-man exhibition?
One week,
starting the 15th.
The year's almost over.
It's like a year-end clearance sale.
I doubt they'll sell.
You seem down.
It's not like you.
I have a lot on my mind.
The scandal?
- Say, what do you think?
- About what?
Miyako Saijo.
She's pretty.
That's not what I meant.
Do you think what they say is true?
- It doesn't sound like you.
- Why not?
Why not?
You're not the type for scandals.
Now Mr. Kawamura -
he's different.
But you're safe.
I'm very picky
about whom I pose nude for.
But I never worried with you.
You haven't done any nudes for a while.
Am I such a lost cause?
No, not at all.
It's all right.
It's true what they say about giving birth.
My stomach got all flabby.
But if you want to paint nudes,
feel free to use other models.
Don't worry about me.
It would be hard
to find another client like you,
but I'm sure I'd get by.
It's not that.
Stop being foolish.
I'm just beginning to have doubts
about nude art in Japan.
We lack both the tradition
and the healthy spirit
to accept the naked body.
People say our nudes lack proportion.
What they really lack is spirit.
I get it.
You hatch these crazy theories
to save me embarrassment.
Let's take a break.
It's okay.
You're a good man.
Just remember:
I'll always be on your side.
When you go to court,
call me as a witness.
I'll yell at the judge,
"Mr. Aoe's innocent! I know it!
My experience tells me so!
He's the only man who never
leered at my naked body.
Other artists
always get fresh, but -"
What's wrong?
The window!
Someone's peeking in!
He's gone now.
He gave me the creeps.
OTOKICHI HIRUTA
ATTORNEY AT LAW
Not a single streetlight around.
I stepped into some open sewage.
What a mess.
The dark is ideal
for trespassers.
Doesn't it frighten you
to go out at night, Mrs. Aoe?
No. And I'm not his wife.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
It's none of my business
who you are
or what your relationship is.
You see,
I respect people's privacy.
In fact, it makes me furious
the way people these days
enjoy exposing others' private lives.
The public seems to love
inflicting misfortune on the fortunate.
The world's become a dark place.
We used to distinguish clearly
between right and wrong.
At some point
we forgot that distinction.
Now we don't have the foggiest idea
of right and wrong.
In all my 50 years,
I've never seen
a more confused age.
By the way, Mr. Aoe,
it was a delight to read
how you slugged that publisher.
It may have been reckless,
but I think occasional recklessness
is part of human nature.
An overly prudent life
is a shabby thing.
As I said,
this is a confused age,
making a little recklessness
practically indispensable.
The hard part
is finding the balance.
That's where
the law comes in.
What if the publisher
sues you for assault?
Even scoundrels know the law.
It's a danger...
a real danger.
Do you have a doctor?
All prudent people
have a family doctor,
but very few have lawyers
whom they consult regularly.
Japan has only 5,900 lawyers,
while America has 170,000.
Japanese people only scramble
to find a lawyer when they're sued.
This may sound strange
coming from me,
but nothing's worse than
an unethical lawyer. It's a real danger!
- What is it you want?
- Huh?
Oh, forgive me.
- What is it?
- My briefcase -
Near the entrance.
I read that you plan to sue Amour.
Is that true?
It is.
Excellent!
Fifteen years ago, a police officer
arrested a man for urinating in public.
The man sued.
It went to the Supreme Court,
and he won.
By the way,
do you have a lawyer?
No, not yet.
Let me take the case.
I was truly infuriated
reading that story in Amour.
The media is a kangaroo court.
Do people have no basic rights?
I can't even find the words.
Look, I'm even willing
to do this without pay.
That's how outrageous I find it!
Honestly, I don't even
recognize guys like Hori
as part of the human race.
They're sneaky vermin,
and they stink.
They stink!
What was it with that man?
Talk about something
that stinks!
If anything stunk,
it was his socks!
Well, he made sense.
That doesn't prove he's honest.
Come on! His name means
"Leech Field"! And talk about ugly!
But he has honest eyes.
Let's go see his home.
A man's family
reveals his character.
You'd actually hire him?
Are you really that perverse?
Well, I don't have a lawyer.
Then all I can say is
watch your back.
"It's a danger...
a real danger!"
OTOKICHI HIRUTA
Mr. Hiruta? Are you home?
Please come around back.
BEWARE OF DOG
- You sure about the dog?
- Don't worry.
My name is Aoe.
Is Mr. Hiruta in?
Father's at work.
Is it safe?
Where's the dog?
It died three years ago.
The sign keeps burglars away.
What's wrong?
Got a cold?
No, tuberculosis.
I've been in bed
for five years.
I've gotten used to it.
People think I must be bored,
but my imagination
keeps me busy.
Even in this tiny garden,
flowers bloom, clouds pass overhead,
little birds twitter around.
Now I have something else to look at.
Would you open this screen?
Mother made it.
It's mine to look at
until she delivers it tomorrow.
It's so beautiful.
Even though it's winter now,
the bride who'll wear this
can imagine herself in a garden
of flowers on a spring day.
The wedding is this Sunday.
I hope it doesn't rain.
I'm looking for the Hiruta
Law Office on the fifth floor.
There's no fifth floor
in this building.
HIRUTA LAW OFFICE
JAPAN DERBY, RACING RESEARCH
WEEKLY RACING
APPOINTING YOU AS COUNSEL.
WILL DISCUSS DETAILS IN PERSON.
ICHIRO AOE
Do you know
That southern land
Listen, you can't cancel
your recital now.
The scandal is great publicity.
It's boosted your popularity.
Read that hate mail.
They're practically
spitting on me.
They call me lewd,
immoral, and vulgar.
But tickets for your recital
are selling like crazy.
I don't want
popularity without respect.
I won't be a freak on display!
That's not what I meant!
This piano sounds off.
You're the one who's off.
You haven't sung
any other song since that trip!
Where the trees bear fruit
And the flowers bloom
Where the breeze is gentle
And the birds sing
NIGHTINGALE OF LOVE! A NIGHT
TOGETHER AT THE HOT SPRINGS!
ICHIRO AOE
ART EXHIBITION
Hey, go away!
Don't loiter around here.
- Why not?
- Why not?
Well, you may not realize it,
but you're making
a certain man look foolish.
How is that?
You see, the thing is -
He's too sensitive.
Trying too hard.
Looks suspicious.
That's dirty-minded logic.
He's not like you guys.
I see you're
as harsh as ever.
I'll tell you though, the paintings
he did at that resort really stand out.
That one of Mount Kumotori
is a masterpiece.
He must have been bursting
with inspiration when he did it.
A man in that state
is quite liable to fall in love.
What's wrong?
- Is he still out there?
- Unfortunately.
That story's bringing bigger crowds
to your show than ever.
That's what bothers me.
A girl just asked for an autograph signed
"Love on a Motorcycle. "
I'm closing the exhibition.
Don't be so short-tempered.
I'm tired of being
a laughingstock.
My poor paintings.
Everyone's sniffing
for clues to the scandal.
Don't be silly! Keep this up
and you'll have a breakdown.
Listen, I'll run
the exhibition for you.
I just sit there, right?
Don't worry.
It's even easier than modeling.
Just give me a cut
of any sales I make.
It's almost Christmas.
I have to buy something for my son.
They won't sell.
That's okay.
I'll just take the Mount Kumotori
landscape. I like it.
- Not that one.
- Why not?
Because I like it too.
It's not for sale.
Fond memories, perhaps?
It's true!
It's written all over your face.
Stop wolfing it down.
Fine, I'll stop teasing you.
Just don't eat the plate.
Idiot!
By the way, how's the lawsuit?
- It's coming along.
- Really?
You're working with that lawyer, right?
"It's a danger... a real danger. "
Don't just hand over your money.
Watch your back, okay?
Don't worry.
Just 5,000 yen for transportation.
You're unbelievable!
Why so much?
His daughter is sick.
I told you about her,
remember?
A wonderful kid.
The gods were in good spirits
when they made her.
Pure as the stars in the sky.
I'd better pay her a visit.
Since when is she
handling the case?
The father of a girl like that
can't be all bad.
Have you heard of Henry Ford?
Of course you have.
He's the king of automobiles.
Here's why he's famous:
A journalist called him a "late bloomer,"
implying he was mentally retarded.
Ford took him to court
for libel and won.
He collected seven cents in damages.
Seven cents!
The lawsuit cost him a fortune,
but he didn't mind.
He said it was a small price to pay
for his basic rights. That's greatness.
See, my client
is a lot like Henry Ford.
He rides his motorcycle
with reckless abandon.
He'll take this case all the way
to the Supreme Court if necessary.
That's a fact.
It's an odd lawsuit,
but he's an odd man.
He wants all copies and ads for that issue
recalled and handed over to him.
If that's impossible, he demands
tens of millions of yen in damages.
That spells bankruptcy
for a small company like yours.
The law exists
to protect people.
But it can ruin people too.
It's a real danger.
May I study this?
Now that's odd.
He's suing
for damages in libel,
but the main subject
of that story was Miss Saijo.
As long as she says nothing,
he just looks like a crank.
If she doesn't join the suit,
you have no case.
You're being naive.
Listen here:
We've already considered that.
Her testimony
is the key to this case.
Any testimony on her own behalf
as plaintiff would carry little weight.
Therein lies my strategy.
When Miyako Saijo
takes the witness stand,
tears welling up in those big eyes,
how could any judge not be moved?
Hey, Asai!
Call the Kataoka Law Office.
Ask him to stop by.
You... you know
Professor Kataoka?
He's our legal advisor.
A lot of people
try to shake us down
by threatening to sue.
We'll really shine in court
with this one.
We'll run a special edition.
Boy, will it sell!
There's no publicity
like a lawsuit!
Look.
You came all this way,
and I'd hate to part on bad terms.
How about a drink?
AMOUR PUBLISHING
Good night.
Out drinking again!
You can barely walk!
Masako!
Quiet!
She finally fell asleep.
She has a fever of 101º tonight.
I brought you a present.
What do you think?
A great big bear.
I always wanted
to buy it for you.
I've got lots of other
nice things too.
Father.
Mr. Aoe came by today.
He brought me those apples.
He kept telling me
what a fine person you were.
But deep in his heart,
I could tell he was afraid
you'd do something bad.
I understand how he feels.
Lying here with this fever,
I see things so clearly it frightens me.
You've done something bad again,
haven't you?
Don't deny it.
I can tell.
You're so kind
and gentle tonight.
You seem so sad.
You want to be kinder
to everyone,
so much so that your heart
feels about to burst.
That's how you get whenever
you've done something wrong.
Masako.
It's all right.
Your kindness makes me happy.
I love this bear.
Masako, I'm no good.
I'm a scoundrel.
- No, you're a good man.
- No!
Your father's a rotten man.
And not even
a big shot rotten man.
I'm just a worm.
How did I come to be like this?
People were always
cheating me.
They made fun of me
and deceived me.
Somewhere along the way,
I got fed up,
and in order
not to be deceived,
I started deceiving others.
Dear, we understand.
You mustn't tire her out.
Don't worry, Mother.
The more he talks,
the better he feels.
It's true.
Masako's right.
If a person doesn't let out
what's deep in his heart,
he'll end up
choking to death on it.
Your mother
never says anything.
She never opens up to anyone.
Instead of saying what she feels,
she just quietly sews.
Every stitch releases
a bit of her pent-up emotion.
But I have to talk.
I'm so weak.
As I was saying -
Where was I?
You deceived others
so they wouldn't deceive you.
Yes, now I remember.
Human beings
are such pitiful creatures...
and so weak.
So we pretend to be strong.
It's a danger...
a real danger.
When I read about Aoe,
I felt sorry for the man.
I felt like someone
had struck my own son.
It's true.
That much is true.
I didn't even dream
of preying on him.
Then I meet that scoundrel Hori.
What an absolute beast!
Every cent the pig earns
is as filthy as can be.
Relieving him of some of it
would be like divine retribution.
That's what I thought.
That was my first mistake.
The fact is...
Hori is the perfect scoundrel,
a diabolical con artist.
Every dirty trick
that I know I should be using
to get ahead in this world,
Hori uses and gets away with!
A truly horrible man.
A real stinker.
But this vileness,
this pure, absolute vileness...
beat me.
It defeated me.
By the time I saw what
had happened, it was too late.
Mr. Hiruta!
Phone call
from Amour Publishing.
Please tell them I'm out!
Making me take his phone calls!
Senile fool!
They just left a message
and hung up.
They'll be waiting
at the Kawasaki racetrack.
Is Mr. Aoe here?
No. He never comes here.
The painting of Mount Kumotori
is listed as not for sale.
Might I persuade you
to let me buy it?
I'm afraid
that's impossible.
It seems it holds
sentimental value for him.
Wait! You're Miyako Saijo!
Come on, Takeda!
No, I couldn't.
That would be too much.
This is peanuts.
Besides, I have a favor to ask.
Don't forget
I'm the plaintiff's lawyer, not yours.
Don't forget that
or we're in trouble.
Don't be foolish.
You're better off
settling out of court.
I'll benefit too.
It'll save a lot of time.
Aoe won't look like a fool.
Everyone will be happy.
No more plaintiffs or defendants.
The suit will drag on forever
if Miyako Saijo doesn't sign on.
How about betting
on another race?
Mr. Hiruta,
snooping again!
If there were a dog,
he'd bite your nose off!
Cold, isn't it?
Of course. It's winter.
Have you prepared the case?
That's why I'm here -
Not yet, huh?
I've discussed it with some
more experienced colleagues,
and I've concluded we need
Miss Saijo as coplaintiff.
Exactly!
Let me introduce you.
This is Miss Miyako Saijo.
My attorney, Mr. Hiruta.
She came by to say
that she'll join the lawsuit.
It was a great relief.
We were just celebrating.
Please join us.
Mr. Hiruta, come on.
AOE AND SAIJO SUE
PUBLISHER OF AMOUR
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
OR HARASSMENT?
FURIOUS ARTIST AND SINGER
SAY SCANDAL IS UNTRUE!
GOSSIP RAG SHAKEN!
This puts me
in an awkward position.
It's hard. They trust me.
I mean Aoe is so -
Enough!
I'm not interested in excuses!
Stop playing dumb!
I gave you that cash for a reason.
You'll do as I say in court.
Don't forget:
You work for both sides now.
Boss!
Boss, will this really work?
Fool!
Stop being so negative.
Call Professor Kataoka.
Kataoka?
I thought you were bluffing.
What if I was?
- We have no introduction.
- Then we'll have to beg.
If we don't, we'll lose.
It's my principle
as an attorney
to be willing to take on
any kind of case,
but I won't engage
in a foolhardy contest.
They're the ones
being foolhardy.
I have every confidence.
I'll defend our good name.
The case will hinge
not on how it was reported,
but whether the affair
actually took place.
If you can prove it did,
you can prevail.
But if you can't...
Mr. Aoe!
No, it's Santa Claus!
I'm a dog!
A beast!
I'm a worm!
Think of poor Masako!
What's going on?
You'd never understand!
You can't!
Let's go get a drink and talk.
No! I'm a dog... a worm!
I'll look after him.
Don't worry.
Mr. Hiruta!
Hey, pops, wanna dance?
Order something!
You can't just drink
what you brought.
I'm sorry.
Okay, bring us something.
- How about turkey?
- Make it chicken.
It's Christmas.
Let's have turkey.
You're too young to know.
In this place, the turkey
and the chicken are the same thing.
Only the price is different.
Haven't we met before?
Ladies and gentlemen!
There's only one week left in the year.
One more week
and we welcome 1950.
We know that!
Year after year,
human beings remain oblivious
to the present.
It's too late for this year,
but we believe
that next year will be different.
Otherwise
we just can't go on.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Next year is going to be my year!
No doubt about it.
I'm going to do my best!
Next year, without fail!
I'll build a little house
for my family...
and make things
easier for my wife.
Yes, next year
I'm really going to do it.
I swear to you,
I'll do it next year.
The hell with this year.
Come, my friends,
let's sing together!
We're all going to do
a bang-up job next year!
Right? Won't we?
That's a fact!
That's a fact.
That's... a real fact.
Next year will be my year too.
Next year I'll be a new man.
This year I've been a worm.
Next year I'll be a man.
This year I was a scoundrel,
but next year -
That's right.
No need to mope.
Listen, I have a daughter.
Such a nice girl,
too nice for someone like me.
Such lovely eyes.
When she looks at me with those eyes,
I want to crawl into a hole.
But next year,
when she looks at me,
I'll have nothing
to be ashamed of.
Hey, let's all sing!
Hey, you're good.
Mr. Aoe...
please sing with us.
Sing for this senile old crook.
I beg you!
Everyone, please sing along!
I beg you.
Old man, look!
It's a miracle!
Look!
Stars have fallen down
into that filthy pond.
Old man, doesn't it bring
tears to your eyes?
Glittering stars
in the midst of this filthy town!
And a worthless
old crook like you
with a daughter
as pure as the stars.
You mean
Masako's like a star?
Thank you!
Thank you!
Yes, she's as pure as a star...
a real star.
But me...
I was a dog in my past life!
Quiet!
Someday even you
may turn into a star.
You may shine too.
We mortals can't imagine
how generous the gods might be.
Merry Christmas...
everybody!
AMOUR TRIAL BEGINS TODAY
Aoe, where's your lawyer?
He looks hideous!
Those robes went out years ago.
AMOUR TRIAL - FIRST REPORT
Preliminary hearings
in the Amour libel suit
began on January 25th
in Tokyo District Court.
Who might this be?
Laughter filled the court
upon the arrival
of plaintiffs' counsel
in ceremonial headgear.
PLAINTIFFS' COUNSEL
MAKES INCOHERENT CASE
PLAINTIFFS MAKE
FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS
KATAOKA FINDS
HOLES IN CASE
PLAINTIFFS'
KEY WITNESS MISSING
We met on the mountain.
I don't know his name or address.
We're looking for him now.
Silence!
Have plaintiffs discussed this
with their counsel?
LEADING DEFENSE WITNESSES
TAKE STAND
Yes, they both arrived
on the motorcycle.
The lady was seated behind him
on the luggage rack.
Yes, they took separate rooms.
But don't secret lovers
always pretend to be strangers?
We'd gone all that way,
but she refused to see us.
She made fools of us.
They were sitting on the balcony,
enjoying a chat.
They looked like
they had just taken a bath.
Their towels were hung up to dry,
like in the picture.
You may begin
your cross-examination.
No questions.
Your Honor, this is absurd!
I'll testify!
Mr. Aoe's not that kind of man!
- You call yourself a lawyer?
- Quiet!
COURT IN UPROAR!
COUNSEL WIDELY DENOUNCED
ATTORNEY HIRUTA
CRITICIZED IN LEGAL CIRCLES
I don't want them!
Dear, you mustn't.
Please leave her alone.
She has a fever.
Be quiet!
I don't have a fever.
Go away, both of you!
What's wrong?
Is it because
I didn't visit for a while?
I'm sorry,
but the trial's kept me busy.
Leave me alone.
I hate to ask this,
but please don't come here again.
Why not?
The child believes
that her father is cheating you.
She can't bear it.
She's convinced
that the reason the trial
is going so badly
is because her father
is deceiving you.
That's why
the kinder you are,
the harder it is for her.
It's the hardest thing
for her to bear.
I know how she feels.
After you leave,
she'll lovingly pick up
each of these flowers and pray.
She'll pray and cry.
That's how she is.
Let me be honest.
I won't throw clichés
at a child as special as you.
I already know that
your father is deceiving me.
But it's not because
he's a bad person.
He's just weak.
He won't go through with it.
I have faith in him.
You must too.
I swear I won't let
your father go through with it.
Otherwise
I'd never have hired him.
It's all right.
Don't worry.
The important thing is,
we're in the right.
How can we lose?
Listen, we found the witnesses
we were looking for.
We're going to win!
Please don't cry.
PLAINTIFFS' WITNESSES
FOUND IN AMOUR TRIAL
TRIAL RESUMES TODAY
You'll be called to the stand
one at a time.
One of you please read the oath
on behalf of all three.
All rise!
Come now.
One of you read the oath.
What's an oath?
Quiet!
It means you promise
to answer all questions honestly.
Now see here!
I've never told a lie
in all my life!
Do you recognize
these persons?
I sure do.
Ain't that why we're here?
Where did you meet them?
At Kappazawa.
He was painting
a picture of Mount Kumotori.
I never seen a painting like that.
Mount Kumotori ain't that red.
Quiet! Only the witness
addressed is to reply.
I will continue.
Were they together at the time?
The lady came along later.
Ain't that right?
Can you explain
how they ended up
on the same motorcycle?
Yes.
It all happened like this:
The lady there missed her bus
and came on foot.
She was tired out.
The artist man
felt sorry for her
and said he'd take
her bag on his bike, right?
But since he was
going the same way,
they decided they might
as well ride together.
I have no further questions.
Defense,
you may now cross-examine.
No questions, Your Honor.
But I would have
plaintiffs' counsel
clarify one point.
Proceed.
Why were
such important witnesses -
their only witnesses -
not confirmed to testify
before this suit was filed?
Counsel claimed they couldn't be found
because they were chance passers-by.
But that means you brought suit
without any witnesses.
As counsel for the defense,
I find this most difficult
to understand.
Is this how one pursues
a fair trial?
I would like plaintiffs' counsel
to offer an explanation.
- Kataoka's clever.
- He turned the tables.
Does counsel have a response?
- It all hinges on this.
- Their testimony will be worthless.
Worse. It'll hurt their case.
Plaintiffs' counsel has no reply.
Court is adjourned for today.
We'll reconvene...
I warned you.
Trust a guy like that
and this is what happens.
Maybe you don't mind
because you did it your way,
but what about Miss Saijo?
I don't mind.
Don't lie.
Stop it!
What are you doing?
All right, I'll be quiet!
Stop it!
Why are you doing that?
Stop it!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Have you gone crazy?
If I'm bothering you, just say so.
You don't have to go that far.
I was losing confidence.
I just wanted to hear that sound.
Sorry if I upset you.
But I am sorry,
for your sake.
It's all right if we lose.
We can always appeal
to the Supreme Court.
Shut that door! It's cold!
Mr. Hiruta, you're hopeless!
What happened?
Masako...
Masako's dead.
"Father... Mr. Aoe... will win.
He'll win the case!"
She cried out those words...
and then she was dead.
AMOUR VERDICT POSSIBLE TODAY
PLAINTIFFS EXPECTED TO LOSE
This court has heard
from both parties
and has weighed the evidence
they duly submitted.
It is this court's intention
to review once again
the claims of both parties,
define the issues,
and deliver a verdict.
First, the plaintiffs.
Does counsel have
anything to say?
What?
Don't you wish
to put Mr. Aoe on the stand?
Your Honor, may I speak?
Please.
These proceedings have clearly
not worked out in our favor.
The newspapers say
we're certain to lose.
But I just can't believe that
because we're in the right!
That story was a lie!
In the last session,
Professor Kataoka
skillfully used
our own witnesses against us.
He suggested we brought suit
without sufficient evidence.
But if I'm guilty of anything,
it's of placing too much faith
in the legal system.
The one thing I'm certain of
is that we're innocent.
That's why we were
confident enough to sue.
Unfortunately,
we lack enough evidence
to persuade you of that.
All I can show you
are my and Miss Saijo's faces.
Your Honor,
take a good look at us.
Are these the faces
of people who would lie?
That's enough.
Do you have anything else to say?
- I do not.
Does coplaintiff Saijo
have anything to say?
We'll now hear
from the defense.
The plaintiff's argument,
spoken with the candor of a true artist,
was genuinely moving.
But though he has a right
to feel as he does,
he seems to misunderstand
the function of this court.
But let us set that aside.
As counsel for the defense,
I'd like to call attention...
to the manner in which
plaintiffs' counsel
carried out this lawsuit.
An attorney, in addition
to representing his clients,
has certain solemn responsibilities
toward the court itself.
Earlier...
I asked plaintiffs' counsel
to elucidate his opinion
on this matter.
Unfortunately,
he gave no reply.
Mr. Aoe claims
that plaintiffs are innocent
and that that's the one thing
of which he's certain.
Such arguments lead nowhere.
The defendant too has grounds
to believe he is right.
He too believes he is innocent.
Does anyone have
anything to add?
Yes, Your Honor!
Professor Kataoka just claimed
that his client
believes in his own innocence.
But he's wrong.
I have clear evidence
to the contrary.
Your Honor...
please allow me
to take the stand
as a witness for the plaintiffs.
Any objections?
Well?
Do you object?
An objection must have
a reason behind it.
The defense has no objection?
Please take the stand.
This...
was made out to me
by the defendant.
It's a check for 100,000 yen.
Do you wish to submit
that check as evidence?
Yes.
I will examine the witness.
What is the significance
of this check as evidence?
That check is the reason why
I didn't respond to Counsel Kataoka's
question during the last session.
It's the reason I neglected
to call witnesses to the stand.
I have disgraced this court.
To Your Honor...
to Professor Kataoka...
and to my clients...
I humbly apologize.
This evidence
of my own wrongdoing
incriminates
the defendant as well.
Counsel for the defense,
are you in accord?
We are, Your Honor.
- How do you feel?
- How's it feel to win?
I'm happy, of course.
But more than that -
More than that?
It won't make much of a story.
Come on, tell us.
We just saw
a star form in the sky.
- Can you explain?
- Impossible.
- You mean Mr. Hiruta?
- Yes.
Not a very pure star,
if you ask me.
For the first time in my life,
I saw a star come into existence.
Compared to that feeling,
our victory was nothing.
THE END
