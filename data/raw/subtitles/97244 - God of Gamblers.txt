Banker win!
This guy keeps on winning!
Wait a minute. Zoom in on his ring!
Yes! It's him!
What kind of picture is it?
He never take pictures!
Mr. Ko, I am the manager here
We welcome you here
But the directors have just decided
to cut your stake from U.S. $50,000
to U.S. $1,000
Cash!
Who's this guy?
God of Gamblers!
We came to Tokyo on Jan.3
Ko's rival is Mr. Wang
He's the second best punter
Ko said if he won
I could have a holiday in Hong Kong
And visit my friends
I hope this time is real
Chun, it's all ready now
Quiet, it is a break even today
if each wins once
Tell him if I win only once
I will lose it all
Ko said consider him loss
if he wins only once
First game is Mah-jong
Fourteen pieces each to win the game
See who has got the highest point
Fourteen pieces each
And the highest total value
like four 90,000 is 360,000
Start!
Start!
Mr. Wang 790,000!
Mr. Ko 800,000!
Mr. Ko wins the first game
Second game is the dice
Sir, I want Miss Chi to replace me
The lowest score wins
6 points for Miss Chi
Mr. Ko, you were so vain
This pot is too light
Can I have a heavy one?
Sorry, I tried too hard
Only five dices
You are really god
5:6 you win again!
Please!
Cheers!
Mr. Ko deserves this U.S. $500,000
He is well known
And I knew that I would lose
But just didn't believe
that he's so good
Why did you gamble with me then?
Well, it's just an excuse
I like to spend U.S. $1M
To ask Mr. Ko to do me a favour!
Tell me!
The Singapore King Chan Kam Shing!
The one wanted by many countries
Any only free in international waters
My father was representing
our club 3 years ago
To try to win a den
The other club had Chan
To gamble with my dad
Chan cheated to win
And my dad killed himself
I have been practicing
in the passed 3 years
I have to meet Chan in two months time
To have the last game with him
I don't have the confidence
I might need to use weapons
You can solve it yourself
But my boss told me last month
The two clubs had been friends again
I can't shoot Chan anymore!
I can't win by gambling
You want me to gamble with him?
Yes!
Chun, think it over!
Chan is cunning
If he knows what you do
You are in trouble
Well, so!
If Mr. Ko doesn't agree
I am so ashamed of myself
Your death is not my concern
But wait till
I have a game with Chan
You agree!
I won't forget about you
Just buy me a nice box of chocolate
when the game is over
Mr. Dragon!
This is Mr. Ko Chun!
Mr. Dragon!
Mr. Dragon doesn't gamble
But he can solve any problem
But gamble
Hi!
Vietnamese?
Chinese!
Was a soldier?
He was an officer!
He will be your bodyguard!
I don't think it's necessary
Call me at this number
Fix the air-conditioner
Or I take the light bus
No good to have the air-con

But if I fix the veins
He'll be a lot better
You want it
Are you relatives?

The operation is expensive
It will cost $200,000
Where do we get the money?

Brother Shing!
How is it?
He said $210,000!
How can I get $130,000 more!
What about his medical payment?
More than half is gone
And the operation is tomorrow
We have paid the deposit
I don't know
where the rest of the money is
What shall we do?
I don't know!
Only if God of Gamblers saves us
Come in!
Boss, Knife's girlfriend is here!
Brother Shing!
Not bad!
Should join me!
I have $80,000, please let Knife go!
That's not enough for interest!
Please, Brother Shing!
Who the hell do you think you are!
I have to respect you
Not me, God of Gamblers!
God of Gamblers!
Let's be fair!
And be friends!
Is he the real God of Gamblers?
Of course not!
Don't fool me!
I am tough
So!
You are really the God of Gamblers?
Yes, I am!
Good!
Give me proof!
I am the God of Gamblers!
Mix the cards!
What cards?
Give me 1 to King in sequence
Let me do it!
Stay away!
You show me
Hay, have it!
You gave me a pure Dragon?
That's mine, this is yours
How did you do it?
I don't know
you still owe me 7 chocolates!
Here's $80,000!
Did I say yes?
Let Knife go!
I don't believe!
I am God of Gamblers!
Freeze!
Damn it!
Stay away!
Release Knife!
He's not here!
Not here?
He's here!
Bring him out!
Stop!
Stop!
Knife!
Boss!
Are you alright?
I am fine!
Brother Knife!
You bastard!
Brother Knife!
Is it fair?
I am bastard!
Is it fair?
You have your knife
Of course I have to say fair
You are smart!
Tell them to go over there!
Crawl over!
Quick!
Shut up!
Crawl over!
Knife, run, quick!
Stand up!
I need to call the ambulance!
Stand up! Go out!
Be careful!
Be careful!
Be careful of your knife
Let's go!
Please, Brother Knife!
Bastard!
I am bastard!
Boss!
Call the ambulance
Call the ambulance
Eleven days already, no news about Chun
Call the police tomorrow
I suspect Yee's faith
He's kind of funny lately
What are you doing?
Have a drink
I want to sleep
I just want to accompany you
Get out!
Come on!
Don't you want?
Get out!
Or I will tell Chun
So what?
I am smart too
Chung can be the God of Gamblers
And I am of no importance
Let go of me!
Listen to me!
I'll treat you better than Chun
Say yes to me
I promise you that
You come first
I will take care of you
Have you thought of Chun
I have enough
No one knows about me
Every one knows that
I am just a follower
Why can't I love you too?
I have to wait till the day he dies
No wonder you object calling the police
He forces me to do so
He keeps all the money
I'll put him dead
Then I can have you
And his money in the Swiss Bank
You put the tape on
Who will know now
You bitch!
You can never stop me
I want you whether dead or alive
I know that you are Chan's partner
If we eliminate Ko Chun together
I think you are interested
Ko Chun is a fool
To have a pal like you
I am smart
It's not easy to be like me
Ko Chun is lost
Wait till we are sure about that
I put U.S.$2M into your account
If Ko Chun is dead, you'll be happy
And I have erased an enemy
I pay you to do the job
Mr. Chan doesn't have to worry
It is good to everyone
I can send someone to do it
But how to find Ko Chun?
I heard that he's in Mongkok
With a villain called Knife
Send someone to look for him
Brother Nam, they are up there
I am Knife, who you are?
My hand
Ko Chun!
You are not Ko Chun!
My hand
Haven't heard from you for so long
Who are you?
I am Dragon, Ko Chun's friend
Who is Ko Chun?
He is!
He is the God of gamblers
I am not involved
Who are they?
Enemy!
Rubbish!
Is there a back door here?
One over there to the mall
Give me the gun!
You know how?
I think so!
So you said so
I said how to hold it
Hold it with two hands
O.K
Be careful!
I am alright, leave me alone!
Master! Master!
He's alright!
Knife, It's alright!
Let's go!
Where's Ko Chun?
Over there with Knife
Hide away!
O.K
Stop!
Get down!
Master, let me do it!
Master, let's go!
Master, come over!
Stop!
Master, let me handle it
Where is master?
Don't shoot!
Chun!
Don't get close
Where have you been?
I don't know you, stay away!
Chun, don't fool me
I am here to save you, let's go back
A lot of guns pointing at us
Chun, are you alright?
I am scare!
I am Yee, remember me?
I am scare, so many guns
Ko Chun, I don't care if you are insane
You are a dead man now
Master, you go first!
Ko Chun!
Pick up the gun
Come out!
Come out...
Be careful!
Ko Chun!
Stand clear, what's matter?
Are you alright, stop!
How many casualty in the mall?
Does it involve Vietnamese?
Is the God of Gamblers involved?
No comment!
Sorry!
Is the God of Gamblers up there?
I am not sure!
How's the guy?
Is he going to recover room?
No comment! No comment!
Sorry, no comment!
Chun, I am Yee!
Do you recognise me?
I am Yee!
Yee?
So good you are O.K
Yee!
What's happened?
You don't know?
I only remember
that night after the train
I was walking along a path
And I fell suddenly
And then I can't remember anything
How did I come here?
I have told the police
You were knocked down by a car
Where's Janet?
Where's she?
I am sorry, Chun!
Yee, tell me what had happened?
I was looking for you after the 10th day
And Janet was all alone at Croc's villa
When I went back there
Blood was on the floor
And Janet was gone
How come?
Chun, smack me!
I am useless!
I couldn't protect her
Chun, smack me!
Excuse me!
So many people
They are reporters!
No!
Why no, come!
O.K
Help, help!
Chun, where do you want to go?
Let me check out, I have to find Janet!
Calm down!
You can go nowhere?
Chocolate!
You bastard!
Stop fighting!
You help my rivals!
Yee!
Who's he?
You forget about me!
I have kept you for months
What are you talking about?
What I mean?
He's insane!
What's matter?
He's mad! I am insane!
Officer, get him out! Let me go!
Don't trust him!
Don't trust him!
I have to fix it
The police will take care
Make some calls for me
to look for Janet!
Yes!
Hay, so what cops!
I am a tax payer!
Respect me!
You have never paid tax
Are you kidding!
I am not!
Do you know that?
He said he didn't know me!
And wanna arrest me!
You are crying, boss?
Who said so?
That's because of the sand in my eye
Hay, so?
Don't ask me!
I'll be back!
See who is the loser!
Be careful, boss!
Leave me alone!
I wanna proof he will lose
This one?
Not this one, another one
You'll get too fat, no more chocolate
Hay!
Chun?
Yes!
So nice to see you
I ring you up as soon as
I hear about you
Something important to discuss
What?
You son of the bitch!
Brother Nam, that's a way to make money
What about the U.S.$2M?
I'll pay you
after you have fixed Ko Chun
You have plenty of chance
I don't want him dead
You fool me?
Nam!
Stop!
Mr. Chan!
Why do you want Ko Chun alive?
You are smart Mr. Chan
The bet between you and Ko Chun
Is hot stuff to other punters
They bet 3:1 to say Ko Chun will win
No more rubbish!
If I can make him lose
It is a way to make money
How to make me win?
Stop
I thought the God of Gamblers is perfect
But, not well experienced
Mr. Chan we have watched tapes of Ko's
Nothing wrong with his games
I have watched his 500 card games
He has some minor habit
He may not know himself!
If Yee didn't tell me his last card
I wouldn't have noticed
What is it?
When he plays the trick
He would touch his jade finger ring
Mr. Chan, leave it to me
Ace, King, Queen & Jack
What can you see now?
Nothing!
Take my glasses
Ace has a dot, K two
Q three and J a line
This chemical
Needs a special pair of glasses
The glass has chemical
And only the States can do it
I have ordered one pair
Lost U.S. $10,000
But it won't work
There will be someone to
inspect the cards
And if they use the same glasses
They will find out
You are right
It is common practice
Mr. Chan
who will do the inspection for you?
Me!
Right Ko Chun will ask me to do it
No one says anything
Who will know the trick?
He is not really the god!
Uncle Hing!
I am sorry!
Chun, you are late!
Let's go!
Have a drink!
I only drink with my friends
What?
See you later!
Uncle Hing, I wanna go the toilet
Show him where
Please!
What do you want?
I promised not to leave you alone!
I tell you only once
Your cousin wanted to shoot you
Yee, he said you wanted to kill me
Is it right?
I dared not!
I know you want to talk to me
Wait till I've finished the game
Yee, bring him in!
Remember to keep quite!
Yes!
Mutual inspection of cards!
We can start!
Ace!
$20,000!
$50,000!
Mr. Chan, so careful!
Is better be careful!
I want to celebrate my 70th next year
7 pair to call!
$2M!
Good price!
No Heart I could have Fa!
$2M for me too!
How lucky!
It's $2M after the 4th card
The 5th should not less than $5M
Same Fa $5M!
What a tricky one!
I should not be threatened
I put $5M too
Master...
You seem to be able to read my cards!
You are not perfect yet
Freeze!
Chun, it's the last box
Ace to call!
$200,000!
No problem!
Pair Ace to call!
$2M!
I will follow
My turn again?
I have to get back my last loss
$4M
I don't think you have so much cash!
I have a Swiss bank draft
It is of U.S. $30M!
We don't trust you
Ask an expert to check it
Mr. Ko, no reason to use your money
It's not just because of you!
Mr. Chan, check this Cheque up
Your name wroth more that U.S. $30M
I believe you! I follow!
I have lucky today!
You are not the only one
Chun, we get everything back
Have a look at the last one
It's a King!
Three Ace Vs three Queen!
What a coincidence!
Don't waste time, $26M!
You are very pushy!
Can't keep calm!
I put $26M too, I have four Queen!
Good lord!
You have four Queen, but
You have lost
Mr. Chan, you are far behind
Your special glasses
Is of two years ago!
The one that I have
Is the latest from Germany!
It costs U.S. $110,000!
I put the two dots on this Ace!
And my habit to touch the jade ring
Is to trap you
To make you fall into my trap
I have to thank you, Yee!
You have helped me to beat him
He thought that he knew everything
You betrayed me?
You bastard!
You son of the bitch!
Don't shoot!
Freeze!
Freeze!
No problem!
Don't move!
Don't move!
You expected the tape to finish
Ko Chun, what do you want?
Everyone saw you kill!
What are you laughing at?
I was self defending
Everyone knew it was a toy gun
You plan has a little loop hole
It is international water
Only the registered nation can arrest me
Is it right, Uncle Hing?
My ship is of Panama!
The Panama President and I are friends
Come look through the window
See if you can see Lantau Island?
Sorry, Uncle Hing
My men forced the captain not to go!
It's alright, no problem!
Ko Chun, you don't make any good
You break the law too!
It's not serious!
But you will serve 30 years!
You can't celebrate your 70th
No celebration for you!
Mr. Ko, thanks for helping me!
That's alright!
It is my concern
As well!
How can I pay you back?
Buy me a nice box of chocolate
I haven't seen you smile
Can you smile once for me?
No, I look ugly if I smile!
God of Gamblers!
Good-bye!
God...
He won't remember me!
Crawl!
Jane!
Calm down!
You?
I am Chocolate!
You recognise me?
Why fooled me three times?
It is my plan!
So you fooled me!
I had tried to tell you
Your I.Q. is low
How can you be my partner?
Why should I be... what did you say?
Les Vegas!
Les Vegas!
Right, 30/70!
No! No!
If you betrayed me again?
I won't!
If you don't recognise me
I'll cut...
