The T.V has become
your obsession
Did you like the girl?
She is nice,but something is
missing in her

Legs should be like
a Plantain stem
She should have a poetic
appearance like this

like her?
Don't ask your father to
search a bride for you
Then,He will choose like her

Then,tell it to me
Madam,Madam

Hold this note book
Hey,Stop it
Do you have sense?
Are you not educated?
You are getting in
at the signal. Get down
Do you have sense?
Why didn't you stop
at the bus stop?
I will stop
or I'll not stop -
Is it your father's bus?
Hey! Get down
Our exam starts at 9.00 A.M
If we miss this bus,we will not be
able to write the exam
That's why,we rushed
into the bus
You didn't stop, & you are
talking like a fool
Now,are you going to
get down or not?
No
Hey! Get down
Get down
Stop the bus,
stop the bus
Students attacked me
Stop the bus
Stop the bus
They are hiting me,
hiting me -
They attacked bus driver
Bus will not move,Get down
Stop, What's the problem?
Who is the bus driver
Start the bus
Because of you,
there is a traffic jam
Do you know who am I?
Driver
I am ruling
party's driver
Go & bring the camera
I'll start the bus only
when you arrest these students
Hey,Keep quiet
This driver only
attacked our student -
We'll move only when he
asks pardon from us
First,Park your bus
on that side
In the peak hour,You are parking the
bus in the middle of the road
Let the traffic be cleared
then we'll argue..
First you start the bus
The bus will not move
Near Teynampet signal a bus
has been made to stop
There,whether the students have
hit the driver -
Or the driver has hit the students
It's a big question
Upto 1 Km,there is a traffic jam
because of that bus
Inform the Commissioner to
visit the spot immediately
We'll find a solution
Hey,driver is going
that side
Leader,Greetings
While we are on duty
Driver Murugesan's head is bleeding
because students had attacked him
lmmediately,you call & talk
with all the City Transport
Stop all the buses in
and around Tamilnadu
Excuse me,ls the auto free?
Yes
Keep it on your head,
it will come,Go
Hey,come
Excuse me,Will this bus
go to the temple?
You Swine
Get in,lt will also go to
heaven
Okay
What! It is a traffic jam
bus will not move
All are in tension
you are reading newspaper
Cruel people! Why are
you creating problems?
At the age of 32,now only
my daughter's-
Marriage has been fixed
The bride & the auspicious
thread is here
And groom's people will
be waiting for us
The auspicious time
is going to pass away -
In such a situation,you
are stopping the buses -
Who will be responsible if my
daughter's life gets ruined
Hey,get lost
Cruel people
Sir,I have got the last chance
for an interview -
If I don't get the job
I'll have to commit suicide
Sir,I beg of you,please
start the bus
Sir,My husband is almost on
the verges of dying -
I have to take him
to the hospital
Madam,What can
I do? -
I can start the bus only if the vehicles
parked in the front move
Sir,The driver is not prepared
for the negotiations -
Even the students
are adamant
Move,Move
Ay,the problem is between a student
and the driver of that bus
Why is the whole city
traffic has been blocked?
Who is the driver of
this bus?
Start the bus
I'll not
Ay,come here even you
are a driver,isn't it?
First,start the bus,and
clear the way
Ay,all of you go,
move
Start,let me also
see
You carry on,he'll himself
get up
Will you go across me? -
If you kill me,will my
caste people leave you?
The whole State of Tamilnadu
will be in flames
Let me also see,
go across me
Come on,do it,
let me also see
Ay,Where has this caste
come in between?
Can you urgently connect
me to the C.M?
Hello leader,I am
Palasami speaking
They have run over a bus on the
driver who belongs to our caste
My blood is
boiling -
Are we of no
importance?
We have to show them,
who we are?
lmmediately call for
a strike
There should not be any movement
throughout the city
Sir,the Commissioner is
on the line
Tell me
Sir,the condition over here
has worsened
On one side,they say its
the Ruling party -
And on the other,its
caste problem -
It has become like
a battle field
You are the
Home Minister
If you permit us,we can
stop everything within 10 minutes
Hello,Don't take any
hasty decision -
In this,One driver is
from my party -
And another driver is from the
Caste which made me to win
The students support is also
important for me
That's why if you do any
harm to anybody -
I'll be in problem,
It will harm me
Only because of the fear of
losing such supports -
Such small,letter pad parties
such Caste leaders -
Have started threatening
the Government -
If we don't take any
action -
They'll convert the city
into a graveyard
Atleast give order to use tear gas
and disperse the crowd
Ay,if I listen to you
and issue Tear gas order -
The public will not
disperse
My power will get
dispersed
That's because,the four leged
chair on which I am sitting -
All the four legs
of it are not mine
One leg is of the
Alliance Party
Second leg is of the
Caste leader
Third leg is of the Financer
Who finances the whole show
And the fourth one is of
the Party Members
Even if we lose any one
leg out of the four -
We'll be made to bite
the dust
We should not
end these problems
We have to play Politics
by these
They'll shout for sometime and
cool down themselves
You girls are
playing Chess!!
Ay,What's this two T.V's
One for my 1st wife & the
other for my 2nd wife
Bloody,one you are
robbing -
And you also want for
your 2nd wife
The exam would have
started -
My studies have
all gone
Sir,the situation has gone
beyond the control -
Everywhere the shops are
being broken,stoned,damaging buses -
The public property is getting
damaged to a large extent
We can't control,unless you
give the shooting orders
Ay,if I had to give
the shooting orders -
I would have done that
long back
You know,how big a problem can
be created because of it
Instead of it,let 1-2
glasses break
I'll send that Caste Leader
and Educational Minister
Be patient,till then
He is fit for nothing,He can't take
an immediate decision
Hey,look at this -
If he is left here like this
he might die
Is there any
hospital near by?
There is one S.M Hospital,
which is 1 Km away from here
But the present scenario is showing that
the traffic will not get cleared
Alright,hold this
Hello,What's your
name?
Hello,Paremalakujalambal!!

with great difficulty

for you

Greetings
Today our special guest is...
Greetings
Greetings
Respected Chief Minister
Greetings sir
Greetings sir
Greetings
Please,Sit down
Are you going
to interview me?
Yes sir
What's your name?
Pugalenthi
Greetings
A special guest that I am
going to interview today -
Not only our country -
But the entire world -
Doesn't need any introduction
to him
Greetings,sir
Greetings
In every election,
Public votes -
With a faith that elected C.M
will do some good for them -
In the end they are cheated
and disappointed
This is happening in our
Government also
Sir,What is the reason
for that?
What are you saying?
In every house,there is
a Colour T.V -
In every village,there is
Dish antena -
In every street,there is
an S.T.D Booth - & Internet
All are going
on Two wheelers
In jewellery shops &
Garment stores
There is a big
queue of buyers
They are going to amusement parks
& expensive restaurants
Not only that,they are wearing
slippers & watches
The standard of living
of people has increased
For the last 15 years -
Is there any news of people dying
out of hunger & poverty
As you say,no farmer is going
to a jewellery shop
No labourer is going
to the restaurant
People who are earning illegally
& taking bribes -
Are only leading such
luxurious lives
Rich are becoming richer
& the Poor are becoming poorer
They are still being squeezed
in buses and trains
The people are still standing in
queues for Kerosene & Rice for hours
They are sending the children to
school only for the nutritious noon meals
Sir,our children are still
begging on the streets
Some people always complain!
Brother! After I came to power the
literacy rate his gone up to 62.5./.
But sir,State of Kerala
has achieved 100./.
As for industries is concerned from
7th place it has come up to 5th
Sir,don't we have more respect for a
Gold medal winner than a Bronze
People below the poverty line has
come down from 39./. to 32./.
But,still in our villages,the average
income of a man is still Rs.3/- only
Brother,You have to talk only when
you are well aware of the statistics
Sir,Just a minute!
Sir,This is a report from
World Economic Forum!
This is a IMF report! -
This is from Amnesty
International
This is World Bank's report!
The Credit from World Bank has not
reached the people properly -
And that your ministers have
gobbled up all the funds -
Saying this they have cancelled
the next instalment also
Brother! You don't know?
The World Bank people have almost asked
for the mortgage of our state -
Putting 1008 conditions
What are those conditions?
Would you specify it?
That's not for you!!
I'll tell it to the people!
The people are watching!
Please tell me!
Why did the World Bank stop the fund
which we should have got?
Brother! It's a 1000 page
report!
There are 18 annexures
Pay Rs.15 and get a copy from
Secretariate!
And then read it leisurely and
explain it to the people
Next question!
Sir,Are you from an affluent family
before entering Politics?
No,I am from an ordinary
farmer's family!
Oh! What is your salary?
What?!
What is your salary?
After all deductions,I get
about Rs.18,000
Say that's! About Rs.2 Lakhs per
year
After addition and deductions
your total earning till now -
May not exceed 25 lakhs!
But,today you own properties
worth 800 crores!
How did you earn those properties?
Cat on a Hot tin!!
This is false accusation!
If you want to,you can file a
case against me in the court!
I'll come to the court and prove
myself to be innocent
Case?!
In the past 10-15 yrs,Pending cases
awaiting prosecution are 14 lakhs
This delay has emboldened the
Criminals to do more crime -
I am not saying this...
This Human Rights Commission
report is saying
Do you remember this?
I remember having seen it!
Your election manifesto!
Don't your remember it?
How can I forget it? I was the
one who wrote it
Every promise,I can remember
it by heart
To form a castless
society..
To maintain peace in law and order -
To protect women
To distribute the basic commodities
at a reasonable price
Free education to all -
There was a spelling error there
I know it by heart
Do you think all these have
been achieved?
Are you saying that we
haven't achieved it?
You are saying that you'll maintain
peace in law & order -
But,you are the man behind
the chaos in Law & order
You said you'll form a
casteless society -
But,you are the one who instigates
those caste conflicts!
Brother!
Are you questioning me!with an
intention only to to anger me?
That's not my intention! People
should know the truth!
Please have a look!
Stop all the buses running
in Tamilnadu
Will you go across me?
If you run over and kill me,Will my
caste's people leave you?
The whole of Tamilnadu
will burn
A driver stops his bus on the road
and creates a traffic jam
If asked,he says he is from
the ruling party!
The traffic police are unable
to take any action on him
Another driver falls at the tyres and
threatens in the name of caste
A Police Commissioner is unable
to do his duty!
And,When you were asked to
take the action -
Fear of losing that caste's
support -
You remained silent without
taking any action
The Whole of Tamilnadu
was burning!
You were not bothered
about that!
A lot of people were affected,but
you were not bothered about it
Loses were a staggering 300 crores
but that's not important for you
The only aim you have is not to
lose your seat of power.Isn't it?
To make this interview a sensation
and make a name out of this -
You shoudldn't ask without any
evidential support
I have the evidence
In this one driver
belongs to my party -
Another belongs to a Caste which was
instrumental in my election wins
I need student's support also!
Whomsoever you lay your hands on
will lead into more trouble
That will affect me!
They'll shout for sometime
and disperse!
Hey! If I wanted,I would have given
the shooting orders long back -
Do you know how much more trouble
it would have created?
Don't bother about breaking up of
a few glass windows?
You just keep quiet!
Now tell me
Aren't you more concerned about your
seat than the welfare of the people?
Come on & speak!
What's going on?
Aranganar,has been rendered
speechless!
Hey! You come on reply him!
He's blushing!
Very nicely cornered him!
Switch off!
I'll kill you!
Tell him,to switch off!
Hey!ls it way to Interview!
Stop the camera!
Stop the camera!
Hey! Baldie! I'll hit you
with my slippers!
Stop the programme! I am warning
you to stop it!
Are you interviewing?
I'll kill you!
Hey! Palavesham! Turn the camera
to the control room -
A person here is showing
his slippers
I'll burn down the T.V station!
Oh! God they are picturising
even this!
Hey! Brainless!
If this had been a legislature
We could have expunged the remarks
from the house records
This is a live telecast,the whole of
Tamilnadu will be watching this
Throw down the slippers!
Will I also be seen?
What you? You,the slippers
in your hand -
The dung in your slippers,
everything will be seen
You imbecile! Throw it down!
Unable to bear the stench!
Sir,He wants to become
an M.P
Brother! Will you please
make way?
Sir,Will you take the light?
Leader! Discontinue the interview
and get up!
That's all the interview
is over,isn't it?
Greetings!
Sir! The interview is
not yet over -
It's a live relay and the people
are watching!
You have not yet answered
my question!
So Please sit down!
You have dubbed it
very nicely!
You have dubbed my voice with
someone who has the same tone -
And trying to mar my reputation
in public -
I don't have to reply
for all this!
I had only photographed
that strike
How much bribe did you take from
the opposition party?
How much you would've paid had you
been in the opposition?
With a mike in a hand and
a T.V station to boot -
Wearing a coat,you'll
ask anything -
For that,do I have to
answer them?
Answering them is
your duty!
For that only,6 Crore people
have elected you!
Do you know what does a
C.M's position mean?
Did you ever step the threshold
of the C.M's office?
Come and see!
How many people come to
meet me on a day
How many fulls and empties?
How many tears?
How many thanks giving?
How many critical times?
How many garlands?
How many riots?
How many problems?
How much of tension,only he knows
who is sitting there?
Nothing can be decided on
a spurr of a moment
If a disturbance out breaks -
We'll have to foresee -
And take a decision,which will not
affect anyone in future
I have done that only!
The problem that could have been
solved easily -
You wantonly made it to grow bigger
for your personal gains
Now,don't give silly reasons!
I am saying that,if you put your
finger in the fire,lt'll burn you
You are not able to
understand it
You put your finger and see only
then you'll understand
One day...For one day you become
a C.M
Then you'll understand!
This is not the correct answer!
How can I sit in
your seat?
It may be good for
an argument!
But,is it possible?
It is possible!
There is a provision for it
in the Constitutional law
I can issue an ordinance
to that effect -
You see it for yourself
for one day!
Me?! You are joking!
I am saying it seriously!
For one day you sit
on my seat -
My seat is a bed of thorns and
a crown of thorns
You'll understand
What can be done? What
cannot be done?
You'll understand it clearly!
After that how difficult
is the C.M's position -
Go and explain it to the
people of this country!
Say ''Yes'',say ''Yes''
Say ''Yes'' say ''Yes''
What's this? They are playing a one
day match with the C.M's seat
Our C.M is talking silly since his
visit to the State of Bihar
No sir,That's not my job!
Look,you are backing off
from the Challenge!
That's it!
Never play silly with a
National leader
When given an responsibility you'll
back off but always question
That's it!
When a person like you is given a
responsibility and challenged directly
You are backing off!
What? Will you try it
for a day?
It's a live relay,People are
watching -
Come on reply!
Shall we stop this
interview?
Yes sir,if it is possible
then I am ready
One day,I'll be in your
position and see
He's got stucked up as he challenges
the general body meeting
Okay,let it be
Let me atleast in my life work with
an educated C.M for a day
Okay,brother!
Victory to India!
Hey,move,move
Excellent!!
Pugal! My dear friend!!
Excellent job!!
Silence,Silence
He has simply asked him to
become C.M for one day
Please tell us,whether it is
admissable in law or not?
It is
There is a precedence
When the assembly is
not in session -
We can do it
by an ordinance
Otherwise
Say it
Sometimes ago,ln Bihar wasn't
a C.M appointed temporarily?
In Delhi,After the death
of a leader
Wasn't the son appointed
as Prime Minsiter?
After the death of
the leaders-
It's usually done like this
When a C.M went for a bye-pass
It has happened like this
Once it has happened
in this State also
To appoint a person as
a C.M for one day -
Does he have the authority
or not?
Hey! Don't talk in English
Tell me,ls it possible
or not?
It is possible
By using your
discretionary powers
And notifying in the gazette
it can be done
Leader,What's this?
Because it is possible
Should anybody be appointed
as the C.M for one day
Poison can be drunk
but should it be drunk?
Why to take this risk?
You don't know
This is a game of politics
That day,when so many people
were watching the T.V
He said,I was giving
importance to caste vote
That's why during the strike -
He cornered by saying that I
didn't take action on anyone
What will you reply?
Can I accept the truth?
They will hit
with slippers
Tomorrow I can't face the
Public for votes -
That's why I
challenged him
Suppose if he does
something on that day
He can't do anything
Before he comes to
know the duties of C.M
That one day will
be over
You see,he will go mad
& run away
Two birds in one shot
Because one person
has blamed
This Araganathan has
given up his post
And this will enhance
my image
It is easy to
blame others
But doing something is difficult
public will understand this fact
Leader,Whatever you are saying
it may be true,agreed
This is my
resignation letter
For appointing Mr.Pugalenthi as the
C.M for one day
This is a letter from
145 M.L.A's supporting him
I,N.Pugalenthi
In the name of the Government
I accept the post
of C.M of the state
Under the law of Indian
Secrets Act -
I abide to protect all Government
Secrets that come to my knowledge
I give my assurance -
Greetings! Viewers
C.M of one day is taking
his charge
In the history of Indian
Politics -
This is the first time that such a
live telecast is being taken -
To telecast this
The State has crowded with
all the National Channels
Counsellor himself is coming
in a contessa -
And the C.M is coming in a
Public transport
I think,the Country has
definitely progressed
Please come
Why are you disturbing him,
he has just arrived
Till yesterday you yourself were
an ordinary T.V reporter -
Even without your expectation
suddenly out of the blue,one day
You are sitting on the C.M's seat
how are you feeling about it?
You'll have to excuse
me -
I am not sitting here for
giving an interview
I am thinking of doing something
creative and constructive
Thank you so much for
your love
Listen to what
is said
I want to immediately see all the officials
from I.A.S & I.P.S Departments-
Make the arrangement
Greetings to one
and all
Sir,he is Anand Krishnan
I.A.S
I have no time for
the introductions
There are 3 people responsible in
tarnishing the growth of this country
One
Those who are not abiding by
their assigned duties
Two
Those who become a hindrance,while
others performing their duties
Three
Those who are misusing their
authorities
The criminal to get rid of
his crime -
By threatening,by apple polishing,
by luring -
Or by giving the other a
share of his bribe -
Are washing away their
sins
This starts from an ordinary
peon -
And reaches till the level of I.A.S,I.P.S
Officers and also till the Ministers
There is no one who punishes
them -
Nor there is any fear among them
of getting punished
On such people,the complaints
that have been registered -
And the action for it,Which has
still not been taken -
All those files,within 1 hours time
should be brought to my notice
Make a phone call,deliver a fax,
Telex,go in a taxi,or a helicopter
Within 1 hour,I need to get
the list of such people
And if I don't get it,I'll even have to
add your names in that list
What are we going to do with
that list?
I am going to suspend all
those people
Okay,the meeting is over,you
may all go
Great! He hit a sixer in the
very first ball itself
Sir,What's this even you have
come to the slums
Like others are you also going to give
rice,tooth powder,sarees etc
Not that -
I believe that there shouldn't be
any slums in our country
Even our Politician's think
in the same way -
And they burn slums
Come here
Government has allotted a separate
place for you
And it has also built houses
for you -
Even after that,Why do you people
stay here?
Sir,What's this totally there are
350 huts -
Among them,only if 2 are
allotted the houses -
Where would rest of the
people go?
Who is the director responsible
for allocating these?
Here he is,
come fast
How many houses are allotted
for this slum?
The thing is...
Hello,Reply promptly
212 houses
This man says only 2 houses
have been allotted
What about
the rest
Gone with the wind
Sir,half of the place allotted to them
is been taken away by the Politicians
And in the rest of the place
the houses are built
Even in that,most of it are taken
by the members of ruling party -
And persons holding such authorities
like him
This man must be
having atleast 20 flats
Apart from that if they
allot the houses -
They let it out on rent and
stay here
Here he is,Yalaimalai,even he
has been allotted a house -
But he has let it out on
rent to a boss for Rs.1000
Ay,shut up
Inspite of knowing all these,Why
haven't you still taken any action?
Sir,There is a pressure from
the Ministerial level
Sir,They are the one who cast
their votes
Which educated person is
casting his vote?
They give 1000 lame excuses,sit in
the house and watch T.V
If they are driven away,will they
not lose their votes? -
That's why they are totally
ignored
Sir,Where is the typewriter
which I had asked for?
You'll get it,Ay
come fast
What's your name?
Make his suspension order
ready
Sir,What are you
saying?
Sir,Don't do it,ask him
to stop
Yallaimallai,come here
In which area,you were allotted
the house?
You come with me
In this slum,to all those people
who have been allotted the house -
Vacant all those huts and come
with everybody to Velachery
Yallaimalai,which is your
house?
The first house in the
Ground floor
Who's it?
Oh I see,come in,do you
want tea?
Ay,We don't want anything,
whose house is this?
It's my house
What's your name?
My name is
Yallaimallai
If you are Yallaimallai,then
am I Bill Clinton?
lmmediately,vacate this house and
hand it over to him
Sir,Why should I vacate,I have
given money
Why should I vacate
the house?
Look,This house has been
allotted to him
According to the law,your staying
here is a crime
We'll have to take an action on you,
If you at once don't vacate the house -
You'll have to count
the bars
Alright sir
Sushma,Take out everything we'll
go to Sowcarpet
lmmediately,he remembers
his place
In the same way,check all the
other flats
Sir,I have brought
everybody
Ask those people to vacate,who are
illegally staying over here -
And make these people stay in their
respective houses allotted to them -
From now,They'll only stay
over here
When we go that side
If you let it out on rent
& if you stay in hut
I'll rip you apart
Are we really interested in
staying in those huts?
Many of our family members
are jobless -
We survive only because of the rent,
that we get from the house
Sir,to eke our livelihood,if you
make any arrangements for a job
Sir,the god will definitely
bless you
A request to the natives
of the State
My holding the post of a C.M
for 1 day -
Is known to
everybody
If I have to do something
good
For that,definitely,I
need your co-operation
What you all have
to do is -
For this one day
Whatever commodity
you buy
Whether a match box or
a car -
Whether Gold or
a Diamond -
A hair pin or
an aeroplane
Anything you buy,buy only
after paying the tax
If the shop-keeper doesn't make
the bill -
Definitely ask him to
make it -
The tax is one,which is accounted
to the Govt.
In one day,What is the total
sum collected -
Even you should be
knowing it
You're not asking for bill if you get
goods Rs.2 less than its actual price
The money which has to rotate
in the market -
It reaches the owners as
black money
That's why I request everybody
to pay the tax -
If anybody is refusing to give
the bill -
Lodge a complaint in the
nearby Police Station
Rs.350/-
Ay,make the bill
and give
This is in regard to the
business men
If anyone of you do business,without
making a bill -
Your licence will be
cancelled
Make sure,such a situation
doesn't arise
And above that,if you pay your
earlier dues today itself
I'll cancel all the charges against
you in the sales tax commission
Ay,in one day what is the sales tax amount
that we are supposed to pay legally?
40 Lakhs
How much are we
paying?
Only 4 Lakhs
That is what,he is
asking
Pay it,otherwise,he'll snatch
the licence
Alright sir
Ay,What is he
up to?
What idea has
he got?
He is totally
raw
If he collects the Sales Tax
is that enough?
He is building castles in
the air
Ay,Finance Minister -
What is the income of 1 days
Sales Tax?
For the party or for
the nation?
For the nation
I don't know
Shit,you are a bloody
Minister
Stop eating, get up and
get lost
Sir, did you see it
Catch him, catch him,
catch him
Ay,What's all this?
Sir, the lesson he learnt in his school
about the magnet power-
How well he is
using it?
These people brains have
no match at all
What will be its
weight?
It should be around 200 gms
Hey! man,if you are underweighing
200 gms for 2 kg!
With this weight how much you would
be stealing in a day?
Is it right? You
blood sucker!
Hey! What's this?

Whichever side you measure,it will
measure only 21/2 litres!
By taking a commission in
measuring kerosene -
He has won a world cup!
Catch it!
Sir,after calculations he's swindling
about Rs.1500 per day!
He is earning more than the
C.M for a month!
Hey! Whose money do you
think it is?
It's all these peoples!
Look,by paper picking,plastic picking
from all the streets -
Working as servant maids,labouring,
supplying Milk sachets
It's all their hard earned
poor people's money
Sir,What can be done to
this man? Tell me!
Hit him with slippers!
Cool down,Cool down!!
Sir,the people are very
enthusiastic!
If we hand over him to them,they'll

of St.Mary's College!
Eve teasing here has reached
beyond our tolerance!
Boys from the neighbourhood slums
are teasing the girls
It's been happening everyday!
Which is the nearest
Police station?
Police? We have reported to
them many times! -
They are afraid to take any

complaints about eve teasing!
What were you doing?
It's a small accident,these girls
are making it big!
No sir,they are lying!
Please be quiet!
Hey! you keep shut! Come on

In the nearby Kasi slum,there
are 10 to 15 rogues! -
Their whole time job to is
to tease girls!
Their boss is Alan,a big rowdy!
Who's involved in political murders
They never take any action against him
because of the ruling party's support
On that strength,those scoundrel's
are falling on us!
Every time they are patting on
our backs!
It's really disgusting!
Don't you feel ashamed of
listening to this?
Aren't you being paid
only for catching them?
Sir,the police cannot enter
into that area!
Those who had gone like,Head constable,
Constable,lnspector
They have all killed them!
Why? Haven't you been given a uniform?
Haven't you been issued a weapon?
Sir,the commissioner has
restricted my power!
Sir,the minister has
restricted my power
Mr.Mayakrishnan,without missing
anyone place everyone in the list
Without leaving anyone!
Which one here is
Alan's house?
If you go straight the first house

He's entering into some house
in our area!
To your house only!!

Women are like our eyes!
Women are like our eyes!
Mr.Mayakrishnan! What about
the sales tax collections?
Sir,Very high collections
All the treasury's of Tamilnadu have
exceeded till now 260 Crores
Use up all the collected money
for the poor slum dewellers -
To create job opportunities according
to their education and skills
Okay sir,lt's a very
good idea!
Sir,What happened to the list that I had
asked for today morning?
Sir,lt's ready!
It's divided separately,district wise
in the order of its seniority
These are those who didn't do
their duties properly
These are those who interfere
in others doing their duty
That are those who misuse
their authority
Sir,Totally there are
46,518 people!
Suspend everyone
indiscriminately!
lt'll be night 12 before we can
sign these papers!
We have a very
short time!
Issue an omni bus order!
Send through internet!
Like an examination result,paste
it on a notice board
They all should be suspended!
I'll issue orders empowering all the
collectors for suspending them
Sir,but there are some Collectors
also in the list
Then for them you sign
the orders!
If your name is in the list
then I'll sign your order!
Oh! No sir,I am clean!
I am just a little talkative
other than that
I don't even use
a pencil of the office
Sir,Even the cell phone bills I am
paying it from my salary
On what strength so many people
have committed there mistakes?
Only on the strength of Ministers of
all those departments -
Because even they get
their share
Which are the Ministers involved
in this?
Revenue Department,Housing Board
Food and Public Works Depts.
Totally 12 department's
Ministers are involved
Sir,What shall we do
with them?
Actually,they should be
arrested!
Then do it!
Pugalenthi Down Down!!
Pugalenthi Down Down!
Pugalenthi Down Down!
Pugalenthi Down Down!
Look leader! He has
come here also!
12 of your Ministers have
indulged on corruption
We have evidences for that!
Excuse me!
I have no other option other than
to arrest them!
If you lay your hands on anyone
I'll kill you!
Ask them to come in!
Hey! Do you want your corpse to float
in Cooum river by tomorrow?
That isn't so easy!
All the Press people are
watching!
Please advice them to extend
their Co-operation!
Constable,break open the
door
Sir,I just came to
the loo
Leader,What's this?
In just one day,I haven't made any
social reform or achievement -
I have just abided by the duty
of this position
If you would have done this for
the last 5 years
Our country would have become
a celestial ground
Thank you so much for
your advice
Your one day
is over -
You can go
Still there are five minutes
to go -
There is one final work,which
I have to accomplish
You are the root cause for so many
people to commit mistakes
You are highly responsible to those people
in having committed those corruptions
That's why -
I am arresting you also!!
Don't talk like a
kid
You don't know the
law
It's not a joke in arresting
a Chief Minister
For it,There is need of governor's signature,
Supreme Court's permission -
And 1008 other formalities
are required
Don't talk without
knowing the details,Go
Excuse me,Today I am the
Chief Minister -
And you are just an
ordinary man
I have all the rights in
arresting you
Arrest him
Oh my god,This was not at all
in our list
My dear,Your good time
has started
Pugalenthi,Down Down,
Pugalenthi,Down Down
Pugalenthi,Down Down,
Pugalenthi,Down Down
Ay,Move,move,enough of taking
the photo's
Please make way!
Please,a little way!
Leader got trapped us
by his strangle talk
Once again,lf he comes back,
I am dead
Thinking,What will he do in a day he has
put the whole lot behind the bars
Release our leader!
Release our leader!
Hey!Remove your hand!
Release our leader!
Release our leader!
Pugalenthi down,down
Pugalenthi down down!
Pugalenthi down down
Pugalenthi down down!
Keep quiet,We'll get him
released soon!
Advocates move to the front,you are
all lawyers move to the forefront
Sir,Lawyers have come!
Lawyers!?
When will you get
me released?
He'll put me in a Central Jail
before dawn
So do something
immediately!
We have done all the work,all you
have to do is sign these papers
We'll go to the Magistrate's residence
and come back with the bail
Take that!
You,importantly!
That useless fellow's -
All important orders taken as
a one day C.M -
Get a stay order to make
it ineffective!
Yes sir!
I'll issue an ordinance and render
all his decisions null and void
Shall I leave now sir?
Go and get the bail
immediately!Go man!
Hey!You,Maya Krishnan!
Got struck!
Where are you
sneaking out?
Sir,lt was very paining for me
to see you in this position
So,I was avoiding you
Don't cry and deceive me!
I know,that you were with him and
adviced him in everything!isn't it?
I swear on you sir,I did
nothing like that
I was going with him around
just like that!
Blind man! Had he been illiterate he
wouldn't have understood anything -
He was educated enough to understand
everything in one day
He was clever!
Don't play double game
with me!
By dawn,I'll be the Chief Minister!
Do you remember?
Oh! My god! I am a family man
don't take revenge on me
Shall I arrange someone to throw acid
on his face?
Say yes,I'll arrange it!
We'll forgive him and
leave him!
No sir! We'll have to do
something!
What's this sir? For a small scratch,
you broke a man's hand -
That guy has hurt
your heart -
And you want to forgive and
leave him
Left him...but
didn't forgive him
A small boy...
Has defaced my 30 years
of political life
For all his one day's achievements
he should be consecreted -
With Milk,Honey and BLOOD!!
Screwing up means this is
the best screwing up!
Screwed up all the 46 people at a
time that's called the real screw up
Even after requesting you'll never
turn up for work!
But yesterday's screwing seems to
have worked out -
Coming for work so early
What?! Beedi?!
No,Soda water!!
If that man becomes the
Prime Minister of India -
He'll wash everything clean
Hey! He's our one day
Chief Minsiter!
Why are you standing sir?
Sit down sir!!!
What happened sir?!
I fell into a
sewage slush!
If you pour Soda like this
When will you clean him up?
No Water,Man!
He cleansed Tamil Nadu in one day,
We have to clean him in one minute
Hey! Our one day Chief Minister
has arrived!
Leader! Leader,Chief Minister
Lion shake hands
You have achieved;Move out
pave way! Beat the drums!
Hey! One day Chief Minister
has come!
Safely! Safely,
Slowly Slowly!
You may throw him down!
Bring him down! Go Go
All of you move out!
Let all the evil eyes casted
on you be warded off
You have done a
wonderful job!
Now,I am no more
Sensational Shubha!
You are the
Sensational Pugal!
Son! Arrest of Mr.Aranganar was
your master stroke
Greetings Leader!
Greetings Sir!
Hey! Keep quiet!
Brother! Spread and hold
your shirt?
What? Hold my shirt?
Spread your shirt
and hold!
Why?
To measure Paddy!
With your one order,without any
broker in between -
You have made the government to
buy all the stocks directly from us
After deducting all the costs and
labour,for a hectare -
We are getting a nett profit of
5 thousand rupees
After harvest the first measure is
offered to the god
But,now you are our god!
Please don't flatter me!
Our hearts are overwhelmingly
filled.Take this brother!
Take it brother!!!
Take it brother!
What will I do with this paddy?
Offer them to god!
Brother!
Hold it! Brother!
Even then,for the respect you have
bestowed on me...
Are you happy?!
What will my Thenmoli
will give me? -
With great expectation I had
come running -
Why are you hiding your face
and leaving from here?
Hey! What happened?
Why are you crying?
They gave you paddy and raised
your position to god -
What can I give you?
They say that,life is priceless!
But,I will not give
my life!
I want to live with you!
Modesty is more than the life
Take it!
Thenmoli! Whats's all this?
I don't have anything more precious
with me to give you
The paddy they gave is not important
but the honour is
The way you gave yourself to
me is not important -
But,trust you have on me
is more important -
That is enough for me!
The corruptions of Aranganar's rule -
When exposed by the one day
Chief Minister has lead -
The alliance front's party leader
Mr.Thirupathi Samy -
To withdraw his support
to the Government
Following this Mr.Aranganar's
Government has fallen
Again,Elections have been
announced!
Hey! Look a rat pulling
an elephant!
Coming Polls,who do you think
will form the Govt.?
We voted to him because the previous
Govt.Iooted 300 crores
But this man looted
500 crores!
The rulings front's partner party as
if he is very honest -
Has pulled the strings at
the right time
A real oppurtunist!
Again if we vote and bring them
back! They'll squeeze us!
We don't want any
of these!!
If any new person comes
lt'll be very good!
If you ask me,that one day
Chief Minister Pugalenthi!
He should come back
Pugalenthi is the right person!
For Pizza its Italy! For
Noodles its China!
For Chocolates its Swiss! For
Rule its PUGALENTHI
Only Pugalenthi!
Only Pugalenthi!
lt'll be Rama's rule!
It's A,R.Rehman!
It's M.G.R!!!
We want Pugalenthi's rule!
My Pugalenthi!!
Pugalenthi! Bugger!
We want Pugalenthi!!
We want Pugalenthi!
We want Pugalenthi!!
We want Pugalenthi!
I'll look after him!
Greetings sir!
Why sir?!
Pugal,I least expected
this
The whole state is agog with your
name! Come on get down quickly!
Sir! I am not interested in
politics
I'll always stand by you,
Don't be scared!
Look! This is a rare
opportunity!
I am an ordinary man!
With ordinary wishes
All I need is 8 hrs
of sleep!
4 flower like rice cakes and
mint sauce
A game of cards with my
loving parents!
A contentful job!
On Sunday watch Titanic,
Breakfast at Saravanas
And a beautiful ogre in
Pooncholai Village!
That's more than enough
for me sir!
Sir,now my only aim is to
secure a Govt. job
For that only,I am studying for
Public Service Commission
Hey! Man,The Govt. itself wants
to be yours -
And you are trying for
a Govt. job!
Is it the same man speaking,Who
achieved so much in one day?
Sir,We'll always find fault with
cooking in the house!
One day,they'll challenge
us to cook!
We'll accept it on a Sunday
and achieve it
But,Can we cook daily?
We can't!
And it may turn
out good!
But,can we cook daily?we can't
Because,cooking is not
our work!
Then with a pad and pencil do you
know only to ask questions?
Sir! That's my duty!
I am asking the questions,which
the people want to ask-
As their representative
Is it the end of it?
Don't you want to come and stand
by the nation in good or bad times?
I'll stand by the nation,
as a follower -
Not as a leader!
I'll fight as a citizen,but not
as a Chief Minister
Hey! You,What do you think
of yourself?
You'll do something good and spoil
the mood of the public -
And then,make people to look forward
for your entry into politics -
With one throat
if we call you -
You'll say,I'll go to see Titanic,
I'll have tiffin...
Hey you! Who has barred you not to
have tiffin after you become C.M
Oh! My god!
Hey! Where are you backing and
running off? They have come
On every T.V they said your name
now,no T.V will be left here
Go and hide somewhere!
Hey! Look!!
Hey! Are you the next C.M?
Listen to me!
What do you think
of yourself?
Are you the next C.M?
Are you the Sensational Prabha?
Come I'll Sensationalize you
Help me! Please!!
What? What?
Give me a good pose
I'll shoot!
Come,Shoot it,Shoot it in 70 MM
Come shoot...
Mike is broken,take that light
into your hands
You want me to take the light,
You,son of a Cockroach!
Oh! My god! What a beating?
Hey! You swine!
Come,Let's go!
Let him die!
Kalyani! Is water coming
in your tap?
Yes its coming!
Then,Why isn't it coming in
our house?
What's this? Even current
is also off?
What's this everyone's house is
having current?!
Damn it! Even the
telephone is dead!
I'll go and lodge
a complaint!
How many offices will you go
to lodge complaints?
Sir,Who are you?
We are coming from
Corporation Office! - What's it?
You have transgressed the rules and
regulations of the Corporation -
To construct this house!
What are you saying?
Look here!
You have encroached upon Govt.land
by 1 feet and 8 inches
We have been ordered to demolish it
by the Commissioner
It has been like this for 17 years!
What has happened now?
Did you ever serve
us a notice?
We have served a notice
last month,itself
What can I do if you
don't receive it?
Sir...Sir...Sir...
Look,don't disturb us!
Stay away and co-operate
with us
Come on, you start
your work!
Ask them to stop! Please...
Oh! God they are demolishing
You can-
Stop it,if you wish to
I curse them to
be ruined!
Oh! God,its gone!
It's gone!!
You,sinners
my chicken!!
Safely,Safely get down
Safely!
What's this? Why is he getting
down from an ambulance?
What happened to him?
Why is his head extensively
bandaged? What happened?
Nothing! There was a small
problem in Q T.V?
The wounds are small,only the
bandage is heavy
Why? Why is this happening
only to our family?
They have stopped water,
current,phone...
Not only that,those murderous sinners
have demolished even our house
For your one day's
Chief Minister ship -
They are beating us with
our hands tied
Mother,don't worry!
Father! Take mother inside!
I am not going to
leave it simply!
They barged into Q T.V and beat me
at the behest of Aranganar
All are his hench men,I have seen
them with my eyes
Palvesham! You go and call
lawyer Sundarajan
Hey! you stop!
What are you going to do? Are you
going to file a case
Great Idea!
That there are 14 lakh pending cases
in Delhi-
Which you only said
in that interview
lt'll take atleast 25 years for your
case to come to an end
Before that your lawyer Sundarajan
will get beaten twice
From 1947 till now,how many cases
have been filed on politicians -
Had any politician ever been
prosecuted and sentenced? -
Before the case ends he'll rule and
enjoy the power and die -
Only bedbugs will generate
on that files!
For that,do you want me
to leave him?
I am a media man!
I'll call all the T.V's and Magazines
and tear apart that Aranganar
They tore apart Q T.V,
haven't you seen it?
Sir,What was the mistake
I committed?
Doing good itself is a crime
in our country!
I had taken a interview
is it my mistake?
It was my job!
It was an accident,that I was a
Chief Minister for a day
Truthfully,What was to be done
by the people in that position -
I did just that
on that day!
Everything was over!
I have returned back to my
ordinary daily life -
I am just an ordinary man!
Sir,why are they still chasing
and hurting me?
Who said that you are
an ordinary man?
When you sat on that seat
for a day -
That day itself,you had
become a politician
Politics is like drugs! Once
you are hooked you are gone
Tomorrow,if he wins he'll use
police to beat you -
If he loses he'll use his
hench men to beat you
You can never escape
from him
Then,Then sir where is the
end to it?
One,settle down with your family
somewhere near Burma -
Otherwise join Politics!
No,I don't want Politics!
I don't want Politics!
This is the Victory of
Politicians!
Those,Who should question them
never do,but keep quiet -
That's why,these Politicians are
creating so much of chaos
This is a curse on
this country!
The famed bad man of movies
P.S.Veerappa said it rightly -
''LET THIS COUNTRY AND ITS
PEOPLE BE RUINED''
Hey! Auto stop!
Oh! The leader has got up!
Come on get up! Get up!
Hey!Don't photograph me?
New's may reach higher levels
Sir,lts just a photograph!
Mam! I may lose my job!
Don't I have to be in this job,
atleast till this man comes
What are you doing here?
I couldn't stay away!
So,I had to come back
What have you decided?
To get up and brush his teeth!
Move,leader has to go to toilet
move...move...
Stay away from my waist
You swine
Go,Go
Move...Move...Make way
...Go...Go
Hey! Stop...Stop...
Greetings brother!
I am the opposition leader
Vaduganathan! I think you know me!
I know anyhow you'll come
to the bathroom
So,I was waiting for you
from morning!
Brother! Our party has
40 MLA'S
They'll sign wherever I tell
them to sign
Today you join our party!
Who will be the next Chief Minister
Will it be you or me ? -
We can decide after discussion
in the general body meeting
Brother!...
I have cash in a van!
Totally 100'C'
100'C' means?!
100'C' means 100 Crores!
Yuck! What sort of men
are you?
Not allowing a person to go
to toilet and fixing rates!
You go...Stop...Why this
garland to go to toilet?
Is he going to foreign?
He is just going to toilet -
Why do you bother him
so much?
You go
Greetings! Pugalji!!
What Pugalji?! Why are you
changing his father's name
Give it to me!
We are coming from a
National party
Join our party,you will be
the next Chief Minister
From Delhi,500'C' has come
as your growth fund
You intimate our leader about
your acceptance on phone itself
What? 500 Crores?! Pugal!
Give me that income tax number...
Palveshji...
Formality for me too!
If you talk to Pugal and get our
work done -
We'll pay you a 2C
You! Swine!!!
Long Live Leader Thirupathisamy!
Long Live Leader Thirupathisamy
I am Alliance Front Party
Leader,Thirupathisamy!
You need not enter Politics
All you have to do is just issue a
statement in support of us -
We'll accept you as our
spiritual leader!
The rule which you did for a day,
We'll continue to do it
Brother!
Who's that? Who is calling our
leader as younger brother?
Who is that?
Brother!
Oh! Agricultural Party!
Come!
Greetings! Come..
Brother! Saw on T.V that you
were beaten up -
Seeing it,Thenmoli has
been distressed
I couldn't see her distressed so I
brought her here to meet you
Are you fine? Nothing
has happened to you,isn't it?
I am okay,Thenmoli!
Come, with me,I have to talk to
you alone
They are discussing important family
matter. Please don't disturb..
I was distressed listening to your
name from everyone on T.V
I was afraid that all of them
may push you into Politics
Don't enter into Politics
Once if you enter,you can never
extricate yourself from it till death -
Or lead a peaceful life
I am not saying this with any
self motives
But as a parent I am
advicing you
Before you decide
Think once about Thenmoli,who always
thinks about you only
Pugal! I like this
girl very much!
Without anymore talk
marry her!
We'll settle very far away beyond
the reach of these Politicians
Ay,Palvesham move
I can't,now everything is under
my control
You Swine
You have become an
eminent person
Do you know,how many people
are waiting for you -
Just for your
one ''YES''
By dumping crores of rupees
in a van
They have come to bargain your
rate
The Opposition party on
one side -
The Nationalist Party on
the other -
And since you badly
got hurt -
By not being able to
bear it -
The common people are ready to bet
their lives,gathered on one side
And on every channel
of the T.V -
By chanting your name Pugalenthi,
the Public is on another side
And above all,this is the latest turn on
the platform of Indian politics -
Why alone India,the CNN,BBC etc
The whole world is waiting for your reply
What have you
decided?
I beg all
of you -
Right now,I am not interested in
speaking anything
Look,I am just an
ordinary man
I am already fed up after getting
beaten up
Just leave me
alone
Ay,move
Come
Come here and look at
the crowd
Pugal,ls this the crowd gathered
by giving them money -
Is it because of giving them the
liquor or fish chips
This is the crowd gathered
on its own
Look at the curiosity on
everybody's face -
Will a good leader
not come!
Will a good government
not formed!
Will a good future
not arise!-
Look at their
desperation
Today,Whomever
if asked -
Wants to become a Doctor,Engineer
or a Lawyer
Is anyone ready to become
a Politician?
If asked,they say Politics
is a sewage -
If its a sewage,they should
have cleaned it,isn't it?
Leaving that,by handing over the
country into the hands of dirty politicians -
They have got used
to the dirt
What do youngsters like
you think?
A good work and a beautiful
girl to marry
And till 45 years,by saving the
money in instalments -
And buy a small land away
from the city -
Build a house in 800sq.ft and
paint it in yellow colour -
And then reading papers like
Indian Express or Hindu -
And then die only by thinking
about my family,my life & my children
Get lost
If Mr.Mahatma Gandhi also would have
thought in the same way -
Would the country had ever got its
independence -
If Thomas Alva Edison would have thought,
like this would the country had ever got current
If Graham Bell would have thought
like this
Then nobody would have ever spoken
on a telephone or a cellular
Even a small insect like silk worm,
gives something and then dies
We are after all
human beings
Who is he?
What is the relation between
him and you?
Why should he wait for you from
5'0'clock in the morning?
Son,Why have you
come?
Our country is also
crippled like me -
Leader,Make it stand up and
walk tall
Greetings!
In the polls,people's party
leader Pugalenthi!
Has won with history creating
vote difference
Candidates belonging to his party
have won all their constituencies
With an absolute majority,
creating new records
All the candidates of all the parties,
who opposed him in the elections...
First time in the History of world
Politics 97./. voting has been recorded
For the first time a 28 year old has
become a C.M of a state
Candidates of all the parties who
contested against him -
Have lost their deposit
In the History of
world politics...
Greetings to everyone!
What,I expect from you
people is that -
What I did in one day,we should all
do it permanently
And to do that excellently -
I have appointed 2 Ministers
for each department
An intelligent Veteran!!
A Zealous young man!!
We have Laws for everything,but they
are all ineffective
lt'll leak,till there
are holes
Till the mistakes are
being committed -
However good administration we
give its a total waste
First,We should know any mistake
committed in any corner of this State -
We have to rectify that
mistake immediately -
We have to punish the
wrong doer -
For that,I am going to introduce
a new scheme
Complaint Box!!
But,We have a complaint register
in all the departments
Then,Why are the mistakes
being committed?
Because,its beyond reach!
Not only that complaints
registered there -
Go to the same concerned
authorities -
Who never take action on it and
close the file
It has become an ineffective
customary symbol -
But,this Complaint box will be
there in every street of Tamilnadu
If water doesn't come in taps,
or if electricity fails -
If roads are in bad shape
Adulteration,bribes...
I.A.S,I.P.S or Ministers not only them
even if I commit a mistake -
People can write a complaint
without being scared -
Action will be taken
within 24 hours -
Maximum 1 week to rectify any
difficult problem
For this,I am going to start
a new department -
That'll be ''COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT''
lt'll be under my
direct supervision
The day,when these complaints
slowly thin -
And this complaint box becomes
empty
Only then,We can say that a
administration is ruling
And to achieve this we are going
to dedicate ourselves
A green horn,in one election has
screwed up all our political lives
Till,he runs the govt. we have to
keep off from Politics -
We'll have to go back to our villages
to start afresh
That,isn't very easy -
On his instructions enforcement
Directorate is on our black money
He might have been a bandicoot
in his previous birth
He's dug up all the
old files and -
Has registered 800 odd cases!
He'll not rest till he puts all of
us behind bars at the earliest
We'll have to precede him..
There is no other way than to
assasinate him
Sir,what?
Didn't you say there is a
party in Bombay?
Not one sir,there are many -
Like acid thrower,strangler,Ak 47
poisoning specialist -
Injecting needles,Bomb specialist...
Get the Bomb making specialist!
That's the best suited for
our terrain -
And also its very easy to throw
the blame on others
Pugalenthi has sent me to give
you this present
Oops! Cell phone to a country
village girl!
C.M is on the line,press ok button
and speak
I'll go,you carry on
Thenmoli,How are you?
Do you still remember me?
Don't kill me! Thenmoli!
On assuming the duty,I had received
many bouquets from P.M,President...
But the one sent by you,
a country bouquet -
You don't know,how much happiness
it had given me?
How much I was fretting and
fuming to meet you?
Nobody is there to stop me!
But,I couldn't get rid of myself
from my responsibility
I had telephoned many times to
chettiyar's house -
Your father hanged the phone saying
you were out of station
That's why,I have sent you
this cell phone
You can talk to me,Whenever you
wish to,from this cell phone
Will you never ever come and see
me again?
I'll come on Sunday!
I'll be waiting for
this Sunday!
There are 6 nights and 5 days,I fear
something might happen
My father is seriously searching a
Govt. employed groom in the vicinity
Like a Post man,Line man
Health Worker,Mill Inspector -
I am at constant
fear!
Don't worry!
Software Technologist are
waiting for you
Okay! I'll speak to you later!
I have to speak to him
To him,means who is it?
There are 36 ''Him's'' here. Why even
I am also a ''Him'' only
Which,''Him'' do you want
to speak to?
I am Thenmoli speaking!
Thenmoli,Why didn't you say it earlier
that it was you?
I have arranged all that
Who is it?
Ogre!
Tell her that I'll
speak later
He's busy,he said he'll speak
to you later
I am Thenmoli speaking!
Thenmoli,I am Palavesham speaking!
Are you fine?
Damn with your enquiries!
Call him first!
He is in a very important
meeting
After the meeting,I'll inform him
that you had called him
Go to hell! You never inform him!
He has never called me back
I am in distress for him!
A C.M's job is like that
His time no more belongs to
him.Try to understand
What's that sound?
Father nothing!
Take it out!
Who gave it?
He gave it
Who?
He...
He has left you for politics,why
are you still cribbing for him
Who's that?
Oh! That bugger
from Madras!
Oh! Chinnasamy come come
Accusing the former C.M Arangnar
to be behind those caste conflicts -
You had dethrowned him
from the post
What are you planning to
do away with this castes?
In Tamilnadu,there are
totally 350 castes!
But,in my administration,there
won't be so many..
I am going to make these 350
into four
I didn't get it!
In future there won't be any column
for caste in the application forms
There will be just 4 parts!
All you have to do is to mention
which part you belong
By this the reservation and job
opportunities of the oppressed class -
Are being snatched away
from them
All the castes of Tamilnadu will
come under any part,isn't it?
Yes!
What more do you
want?
There won't be any changes in
their customary benefits
By this you may lose support of
many caste associations
I am not bothered
about it!
Everyone is afraid of losing the
support of caste associations -
Today,Any good work couldn't be
taken up with courage
Now,there caste associations have
sprung up like petty shops-
Every street are scaring the
people at large
I am not a person to be afraid
of all these
Whatever is good for this nation
I will do it!
What is the aim of this
drastic action?
After 25 yrs,the future generation will not
themselves know which caste they belong to!
The generation coming after me will
make the 4 into 2 and 2 into 1
Atlast there'll only be one
caste left
That'll be ''HUMAN''
Mr.Manohar,I am going to the village
on a personal work
Why so many cars?
You could have arranged
a P.T car?
Sir,Whenever you go all these cars
have to follow you
It's wrong to spend so much on
the security only for me
The mistakes and the unnecessary
expenses committed by former C.M -
I am very strong in not
committing same mistakes
In W.Bengal,the C.M has
travelled by bus!
You know,isn't it?!
Sir,Don't misunderstand me!
You have life threat
others don't have!
So,we have to provide you
with ''Z'' Category security!
That is our duty!
You belong to
the State -
Your life is more important to us
than your privacy
Today,you are travelling by
the third car!
Okay! I am not going
anywhere!
How's that Thenmoli?!
Nobody is observing
Hey! Standardly one ft blue metal and
1/2 ft of minute blue metal -
2 inches of Tar and should be
road rolled 5 times -
The road laid by you should
withstand for 5 years -
If they open up in one rain
we'll open up your heads
This is our brother Pugal's
administration! Keep it in mind!
Yes Mr.Public!!!
Did you look at our position?
Everyone is coming and threatening us!
Excuse me lady!
Give me five feet of ''Caste'' Jasmine
flower garland!
After our brother Pugal's rule
castes have vanished!
Ask for just Jasmine,I'll give!
Okay,give me!
Oh! God! I forget to
bring money!
Can I give it,on my next visit
is it okay for you?
Even knownfaces are deceiving,
I don't know your face
I am a known face!!
Oh! My god! It's
Chief Minister!!!
Don't shout! I have come on a
personal work
Please,don't reveal it
to anyone!
Sir,he has come to
Pooncholai village! -
In a disguise with blue turban
and yellow shirt and silk dhothi
You keep watching him,I will
come immediately
Take this!
Damn it! There's no photographer
in the vicinity!
Brother,autograph this!
If you have promised to come on
Sunday then you must come
You keep up all the promises
given to the people -
But,when it comes to wife
you'll deceive!
What sort of a man are you?!
Anybody at home?!
Nobody!
Then,Who's talking?Ghost?!
Stop there,Who are you,
barging in?!
What do you want?
Not barging in Madam,I have
come for some sweet nothings!
Why are you talking with
some motives?
I have come here to do
with some ''intentions''
What will you do?
A peel off your lips,a bite below
the neck -
To seize your waist with mouth,
and a small rape!!
Okay! Go ahead!!
Oh! You sinner!
You deceiver!!
Hey! Thopla! Can't I recognize you
if you wear a turban?
Take it off man!!
What's all this disguise?!
Thenmoli! Now I am not a
Chief Minister
No files,No Police around,No siren
I am just an ordinary man
I am your lover! This day
belongs only to you
Order me to do anything?
I'll bear for you
Thenmoli! Now I am
feeling very hungry!
Hey! You sinner when didn't turn up.
I have refused the chicken also!
Only left over rice
is there!
That's enough!
There are no side dishes!
When you are here,why do I need
side dishes for rice?
Thenmoli! I am very happy today!
How nice it will be if we have
2 Sundays in a week!
You are the C.M isn't it? - Yes
You can grant yourself any
number of holidays for you
You don't have any authority
over and above you
That isn't it! The people are
my Superior Authority!
I am just a worker for them!
You have managed even your adamant
father for our marriage
What next? Marriage at the next
auspicious time!
Even without your permission! It's my
duty to save your life!
Clear that stretcher!
Clear it!
I never expected this!
You may have selected this life
of playing with death
But I and my daughter don't
need such a life!
Father! he...
Even after all this,if you still
wish to marry him only
Let him throw all this away and come
as an ordinary man -
I can tolerate you as a sphinster
all your life -
But I don't have a heart to
see as a widow!
What's this father? Reversal of roles!?
I should press your legs!
You have come back from death! Let me
atleast touch you and feel
For that,Why do you want to
touch the legs?
Didn't I do this when you
were very young -
Now,You have a lot of tensions!
Let me massage your legs! -
So that you can have a
peaceful sleep!
Go to sleep!
Henna! Shall I apply henna
on your palms?!
Mother,lt's been long since I
slept on your lap!
How nice it'll be,if all my life
passes off like this!
How nice it'll be if we have a rewind
button in life like a VCR
Mother,Why are you crying?
It's been long since we had
a talk
I feel you have gone far away
from us
Mother,you talk...
What will I talk about?
Except your marriage!
What did,Thenmoli's
father say?
Father,cut that phone call!
You and father come,we can talk it over
and finalize it
Mayakrishna is on the line!
May be something very
important matter
I am Mayakrishnan speaking!...
Hello! Not able to get the
signals inside the house! -
I'll move outside and
talk to you
Sir! I am able to listen
properly now!
Pugal! Just now we have received
an intelligence report -
That a bomb has been placed
in your house -
Ask everyone in the house to
move out immediately
Mother!
Father!
Mother!
What's this? What's all this?!!
Mother! Mother!
Mother,the henna which you have kept
on my hand has not yet dried
Before that...Mother! Mother!!
Father! Father! Please come back
If we also had a rewind button
like a VCR in our life
How nice it would
had been
You are a happy man!
What's this?
Don't do it,brother!
Leave him Brother,leave him,leave him
please I beg of you,please leave him...
Brother,leave him,Don't harm
him leave him
On being appointed as Chief Minister
I,N.Pugalenthi -
To safeguard this nation and
its people -
I promise to be beyond
the personal prejudices!
You,You,What did my
parents do to you?
You have torn them
into pieces!
I want my father's hands
which took me to school
Where is my mother's breast
which fed milk to me?
Where is it? You
Where?
Mother!?
Everybody bury's the dead! or
cremates!
But,I have come here after
washing away my parents
And the reason for that is...
your husband
Is it that early to hold
a CM's post?
Didn't you do something very
drastically?
There are people who may
not like it
Like caste associations,Extremists
Foreign hands-
There will be 1008 enemies
like this
Tomorrow if anything happens
you may accuse me..
Hey! Don't act smart!
I know perfectly that its you!
Stop all this!
The law will come to
get you!
Maragatham! He's spoiled my hairs!
Give me a comb!
Chinnasamy! Before he arrests me
his govt. should fall!
Wherever they see there must be Strikes
Riots,Communal Clashes -
Here and there bombs should go off
and people should die
Law and order should
be disturbed
You sinners!!
To the respected Chief Minister!
For the past few
days
Some suspicious people had threatened
us and stayed in our house
I have gathered from
their talks -
That they may be involved in big
crimes like bomb blasts
Before they commit any
dangerous crimes -
I request you humbly to
take necessary action
From a person
Always your good rule and uninterested
to reveal the name -
A citizen!
Hey! You,Where did this
letter come from?
We don't have time
for that!
First arrest that Chinnasamy!
What,Mr.Mayakrishnan?
I have told you to arrest Chinnasamy
and interrogate him
Why did you call me here?
As soon as he sensed that we'll
be arresting him
The fatso intelligently complained
of Diabetes and B.P -
Admitted himself into
this hospital
They have made a style of getting
admitted into a hospital
Look at him,sleeping like a
corpse in a well
We have to enquire an
important matter
Please,Can you co-operate
with us
He's acting as if he has just passed
out of Poona Institute
He has got high B.P,High Sugar,
and also Chest pain
That's why,its not possible for
him to speak
Oh I see,along with the lawyers
profession,you've also become a doctor
No,I have the medical
certificates
Right now,he is under
what treatment?
There was a small wound
on his leg -
Because of the Sugar increase,there
was gangrene formation -
They gave him an injection
on the spinal cord -
They have cut one of
his legs
Oh my god,where is my leg
Oh my god,where is my leg?
Sir,the sugar has again
increased
Now,what will
they do?
Nothing much,they'll cut the second
leg and keep it in the Delhi Museum
Sir,Please don't disturb the patient
Kindly leave him alone
Ay,Lawyer,shut your gob and
get out from here
Sir don't believe it I am
very healthy
Before dying,people will be
bright & shiny like you
You have sugar,B.P and all the
ailments that are in the medical records
Sir,all those are false
certificates
Don't believe it
Now,Decently tell me,Where all
have they planted the bombs
Tiger Balm,or
Zandu Balm..
Joke! And you expect us
to laugh at this
Bloody,we'll tear you apart
tell us
I swear,I don't know
Chinnasamy look,You are caught
red handed
You yourself have given a false certificate
that you have high sugar
Even if we cut your leg or hand
there is no one to ask for you,tell
Brother
Touch,any of these
3 fingers
This is for what?
To cut your hand
This
To cut your leg
Then this
For that...
Oh my god,Don't cut any of
them I'll tell you
Fast
I'll tell you
We have planted it in
4 places
A bank on mount road,railway station,
in a marriage hall, and one in a cop's bike
Can we do business by keeping your leg,
you yourself keep it
So,then can I take
rest?
Yes of course,but in
the lock up
At once,contact the bomb squads and
ask them to go to the spot
Call up the Police
control room -
And ask them to park all the cop's bikes
in a no man area
Sir,Did you find
anything?
Nothing,as of now
Sir,You go,We'll
do it
Son,Don't move
Wait...
Hold him
There is a bomb inside the hall
everybody move out
Sir,To ruin the Govt. of
Pugalenthi -
It seems,you have planted the
Bombs in 4 places
He'll himself plant the bomb,and
he'll himself defuse it
And he'll put the blame
on us
How is it
possible? -
Not a single planted bomb
would blast
He'll defuse the bomb correctly before
it gets blasted
The opposition party which is
fully united -
The only scare that it would again
come into power -
This is the conspiracy hatched
by him
But,the one which was planted in
his house
But he didn't
die
Don't you learn
from this -
That to protect up his political image,he is
even prepared to kill his own parents
Sir,Your reply
Look,there will be an
enquiry made
You yourself planted the bomb to
kill your own parents...
Why did you ask me
to come?
Hey look,I myself did not wish
to sit on this chair
Neither,did I snatch it
from you
Lakhs of people came searching
for me in my house -
Only in the good faith,that I'll
do something good for them -
And they have casted their votes to me
and made me to sit here
I am thinking of doing some thing
good for them -
But you,...You are not
allowing it to happen
Do it,fearlessly do it, I am not
stopping you
You are not stopping,but
you are spoiling it
Even thought of using your brain which you
use it to dethrown ruling party -
Even 1./. of had you spent
it on the public welfare -
Our country would have developed
long back
You'll always create problems like Strike
Caste conflicts,Bomb blasts..
Will I think about the
welfare of the people?
Or will I follow the trail of
the bombs placed by you?
From the very begining itself you have
been accusing me!
The Police is under your control
File a case against me
Order an enquiry commission -
If you are able to establish
the truth hang me!
Am I stopping you?
I know how a spineless politician
will try to escape from the law
You cannot escape from me!
I am going to kill you!
You are not able to handle
me,isn't it?
You don't have to show compassion
towards a mosquito's life
30 yrs of my political life I have spent
eating flesh and leaving shells behind
Now,I have came to your place-
Everyone outside knows
about it
Only we both are here!
You cannot escape that easily
after killing me
If you have 30 yrs
experience
Adding this 1 years of your
acquittance with me -
I have became a 31 yrs experienced
politician
Now,I am going to shoot..
Not you but myself!
You have made me a fool!
Now you die!
How can I sit in your seat?
It may be good for an argument
but is it practically possible?
It's possible!
Why don't you be there for a day
and see it by yourself?
Mr.Krishnan! Atlast they have even turned
me into a Politician
Sir,leave it. He had been playing politics
always for bad
You have played it only for once
for a good deed!
You keep quiet!
You didn't tell me anything and
I didn't listen to anything
You Sinner! How injusticely
you have shot him?
How's that?
Son! I am ignorant about other
things except agriculture!
I was concerned only about the welfare
of my daughter!
But,you have sacrificed your own
parents for the sake of others welfare -
And there is no one besides you
to take care of you
I bless you!
