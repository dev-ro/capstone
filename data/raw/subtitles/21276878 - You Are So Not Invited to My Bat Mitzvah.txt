{\an8}[Stacy] All across the world,
{\an8}and maybe ever since
the beginning of time,
{\an8}different cultures had different ways
of celebrating a kid coming of age.
{\an8}There's the quinceañera.
{\an8}- There's Sweet 16.
- [indistinct laughter]
{\an8}[Stacy] There's also something
called land diving.
My dad told me that
in the Brazilian Amazon,
there's this thing called
a bullet ant initiation
where fire ants crawl all over your hands
and bite you.
And if you can handle the pain,
you're ready to be a man.
I told him if he thinks that sounds bad,
try being a girl in middle school.

you step before friends,

[Bree] That's what you're wearing?
Yeah, I don't even know who this kid is.
I'm not gonna wear a suit.
It's a junior high friend.
We have to get to know those parents too.
I don't want to get to know 'em.
I liked when they were little.
All we had to know was them

Ronnie, we're gonna be late!
I'll be ready when Stacy's ready, Mom.
It's all good.
Hey, Andy, of course I'll share
a matzo ball soup with you.
[Stacy groaning]
Hi, Andy. I like your yarmulke.
I didn't know you were going
to the Bat Mitzvah tonight, that's cool.
Honey, what are you looking for?
I can't find my earring.
Oh, good luck.
Keep looking, baby.
Keep looking. Take your time.
Stacy!
Sorry, I'm coming!
[exhaling sharply]
[music fading]
[Ronnie] Those are cool.
- Mom will never let you wear them, though.
- [Stacy] She won't even notice.
And if she does,
I'll put on a sad show for Dad.
Oh, she'll notice. She'll hate them.
And Dad will feel bad, but ultimately
be too afraid to stand up to Mom.
I've known them longer than you.
Um, excuse me,
what are those things on your feet?
Lydia's mom bought us each a pair,
so we could twin.
What's twin?
Wearing the same thing.
It's very seventh grade.
Take them off. You look like a stripper.
- Mom, you can't say that.
- Yeah, Mom. You're gonna get cancelled.
Oh boy.
Take them off or lose your phone.
[objects clattering]
[anticipatory music playing]
Oh.
No, you can't. Just take them off.
[Bree] Everyone in the car.
Thirty seconds or there's going
to be no food left at this thing.
You're the one who's not ready.
We're ready.
- I don't know where my earring is.
- Babe, did you look everywhere? Honestly?
'Cause if you look hard enough,
you can find it.
Why would you do that to me?
Because I knew the girls needed more time.
I also... I don't want to go
to this thing at all.
- [Bree] You guys are the worst.
- Yeah. I love you. Okay.
Come on, Mom, just let her wear the shoes.
It's not fair to Lydia

Okay. You're going to hate them

You're welcome.

- [man shouting]
- [Stacy] Ugh, Ronnie!
- Girls, come on.
Anyway, I descend the stairs
of a private yacht on the Hudson River
to cheers and fireworks.
Whoa.
Then! Oh, who's that zipping by
on a jet ski?
Why that's international recording artist
Olivia Rodrigo.
Wait, how we gonna pay for this?
Oh, we have ideas.
They... they got ideas, honey.

No. Wait. No. The old guy
was supposed to be for your dad.
Oh no. Just keep going.

- There.
- Okay.
Oh, this is amazing.
- Shut up, Ronnie.
- No, you shut up.
I'll kill you, Ronnie.
Not if I stab you first!
Oh, that's... that's nice.
Oh my God, this is important!
I'm becoming a freaking woman, everyone!
Okay, woman. All you should worry about
right now is your mitzvah project
and practicing your Haftarah.
- [Bree] Mm-hmm.
- That's not important!
I mean, it is important to you
and other old people and God and stuff.
But to me, the party is important.
If this doesn't go well,
I could end up like Kate Kossman.
You are not gonna end up
like Kate Kossman.
Who's Kate Kossman?
Oh, she had this terrible medieval themed
Bat Mitzvah called Kate Kossman Knights,
not realizing
the initials spelled out KKK.
Yeah, no, I could see
that being a problem. Okay.
So now, she just sits alone in
the cafeteria sewing friendship bracelets
for literally no one
because she has no friends.
That sounds a little dramatic.
Oh, so you think you shouldn't be
punished for promoting the KKK.
Wow, Mom,
didn't realize you supported racism.
Oh boy.
[Stacy] Hear me out.
You're always saying how my Bat Mitzvah
determines the rest of my life.
And I think Dua Lipa
would make my life perfect.
No. No famous pop stars,
no yachts, no sailboats even.
That's so unfair!
Ronnie got a baked potato bar at hers!
Listen, when I got Bar Mitzvahed,
we had a party in Grandma's basement.
We all split, like, this giant matzo ball.
That was the fun.
You know what the theme was? Being Jewish.
Just practice your prayers
and write your speech already.
Oh, I've been doing that Mr. Friedman.
It's all covered.
You're writing Stacy's speech?
- You know I'm not good at writing.
- English is her worst subject.
It's really bad.
- Stacy, that is so not okay.
- [Lydia] It's fine.
She's gonna do my entrance video.
I know she'll crush it. Don't worry.
Can I at least have a virgin mojito bar?
You can have a ball pit.
Oh my God, Dad. That's for kids!
I've had my period for seven months now!
[chuckling] Wait, Stacy.
That's a long period, sweetheart!
You know what? I'm gonna head out.
I'll drive you.
[Lydia] Love you. See you in the morning.
Don't worry, Dad. It'll be okay.

I'm going to say it anyway.
I would really, really appreciate it
if I could have an amazing Bat Mitzvah.
[contemplative music playing]
And I know I need
to do my mitzvah project.
But isn't a mitzvah project supposed to be
giving back in a way that represents me?
Which is why I don't know what to do.
I mean, I'm not popular.
I'm not a loser.
I don't know who I am.
But I do know,
if I have a kick-ass Bat Mitzvah,
doors would open,
and I can have a fab life on my own terms.
[woman] No. No famous pop stars.
[man] You can have a ball pit.
[Stacy] A ball pit? Lydia's
gonna get everything she asked for.
Even a Twizzlers station for me.
I'm starting
to worry Mom and Dad don't get it,
and the whole thing's gonna suck.

- Can we sit outside? It's a nice day.
- No.
I mean, I definitely could use some color.
- Yeah, it's true.

Hi, Stacy.
Hey, Mateo.
Yo, we just had soccer,
and we kicked St. Catherine's ass, 3-0.
Even though their field sucks.
Yeah, that field is so lopsided.
Exactly.
Uh,

It's, um... it's still on her body, so...
Yeah, we love that.
And I'm not barfing, so, yeah.

Uh, anyways...
What's up? I'm Andy.
Uh, I know. We, uh...
we go to Hebrew school together. Lydia.
We do?
Yeah.
[Aaron] I dare one of you guys to jump in!
Come on! Let's go.
[Mateo] Jump off the ledge, Aaron?
You'd break both legs on impact

Yeah, I heard
Melissa Quinto's cousin jumped,
and she now has to text
with her nose, so, no.
Looks like it might be fun.

Hey, I'd jump
if I didn't have my contacts in.
Oh, I'd be happy

- Oh shit.
[Aaron] If she jumps, it's my idea, guys.

Let me take a wild guess.
You haven't started
your mitzvah project yet either, huh?
I'm narrowing it down.
Seema, I'm telling you,
the sooner you do your mitzvah,
which is a good deed,
a commandment by the way,
the sooner you'll find
things falling into place.
Wait, so, if I do a mitzvah,
God will reward me?
- [panting] No, not reward...
- And he'll give me what I want?
Well, I definitely did not say that.
No, thank you, Rabbi. You helped me
so much. I gotta get to work.

- [Andy] Yeah, Grandma.
- Hilarious.
I have to prove
to Rabbi Rebecca I'm here too.
I'm volunteering for my mitzvah project.
- That's what's up.
- Here, I'll send it to you.
- For sure.
- Oh, shoot. I just sent you more pics.
- Just ignore.
- [cell phone] Andy Goldfarb.
Nice.
[music fades]
- [Stacy] That one's way too big on me.
- Okey-dokey.
[pop music playing over radio]
Well, why don't you try the strapless one?
[Stacy groaning]
[Bree] So, how's Lydia's entrance video
coming along?
I finished it this weekend.
[Bree] Great!
No.
Why is it a no?
[Stacy] Just... it's just a no.
Well, okay, then try the last one on.
No, that's the worst one!
[Bree] Well, just try it!
[whining] Oh my God.
- [sighing heavily]
- [Stacy] It's so ugly, Mom.
Maybe it'll look good when it's on you.
[gasping] Oh.
You know what?
I like this.
I look like the lady
at school that pulls kids out of class
when their parents get into car accidents.
How often does that happen?
Can we please get this dress?
Come on. It's the dream dress.
It costs more than our house.
Okay, so wear the cheap dress
in front of God. Got it.
[woman] It's not cheap.
It's reasonable.
That's what every kid wants to hear
on the most important day of their life.
"Wow, Stacy, you look so reasonable."
You know what? This is a nice,
temple-friendly, well-priced dress. And...
No. Don't say it. Please, Mom.
Please, I beg you.
- We're gettin' it.
- Oh my God! You're ruining me!
So ugly, Mom.
- So, is this, like, a swipe or a chip?
- [cashier] Yeah, it's a chip.
[Bree] Good? Okay.
Wait, did I take it out too soon?
[Gabi] Why? We could color coordinate.
[Lydia] We're not color coordinating, Mom.
We're not doing that.
- You want to ruin me?
- [Gabi Okay. No.
It looks like something
the counselor at school wears, Mom.
- [Gabi] Okay, okay.
- [Lydia] Please, I'm not wearing that.
- [Eli] Yeah, I got that app too.
- Eli!
- [Eli] What?
- [Gabi] What do you think?
[Eli] What? Uh, Rudy, hold on a second.
I'm at a family function or something, uh...
Yeah, that dress is gorgeous, kiddo.
Only the best.
[Lydia] Papi, you don't even know
which one we're talking about.
It's the prettiest one.
Just like you, pumpkin.
Twenty-three skidoo! Wee!
Okay, yeah,
I think you gave me a good price.
Mom? Mom, can we go?
Yeah, okay. Take the dress.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
So great. We got a great deal.
Where's Daddy? I don't remember...
- No.
- [gasping] Gabi!
Bree?!
Lydia! Lydia's here...
Oh my God! I haven't seen you in forever!
[Bree] Hi!
[Gabi] Just like the two of us
to be getting dresses at the last minute.
[Bree] Why plan ahead, right?
[tense music playing]
[Gabi] How are you? How's Stace?
[Bree] She's good. I miss Lydia.
She hasn't been over in a while.
Eli! It's so great to see you.
How you doing?
Terrific. We're getting divorced.
Oh yeah. I'm... I heard. I'm so sorry.
I'm not. I'm on six dating apps.
Six? Wow, that's a lot.
Andy broke up with me.
Hmm. Sorry to hear that.
You were the perfect couple.
He said he couldn't deal with the
ticklishness or the closed mouth kissing.
Sucks for you, I guess.
Said he heard
I lied about kissing boys in camp.
Well, you did lie. So...
[indistinct chatter]
[Bree] See you at temple?
- See you at temple.
- Okay.
Anyhoo. Gonna go.
- [Bree] Happy shopping!
- [Gabi] Yeah!
- Bye, Eli! Enjoy those dating apps.
- Yeah.
- Bye, Stacy.
- See ya! Come on, honey.
What's that mom's name again?
Bree.
Are you kidding me?
You need to get your fat head
in the game, Eli.
Stacy's father, Danny,
if you could remember names,
who we've known since kindergarten,
is so involved in every single detail!
Oh, he is?
So, which detail is that?
- [Danny groaning]
- He's exhausted from being a good dad.
Honey. You wish. [scoffing]
Can we get ice cream?

You're right.
This is not the bathroom!
[whispering] Oh no.
[Rebecca] Do you see a toilet?!
I didn't think so!
I didn't need to go.
Well, mazel tov, you guys are married now.
Kidding, but you're in a lot of trouble.
In front of the Torah?
What were you thinking?
I said I was sorry.
Why is Andy not getting in trouble?
Oh, he's in trouble!
He's a repeat offender. We're handling it.
I hope my father doesn't handle it.
He'll put him in a wood chipper.
They'll never find his body.
[somber music playing]
Seema, we're only a few weeks away
from your Bat Mitz. Okay, cutie-pops?
This is supposed to be
the most important day of your life,
and you're not taking it seriously at all.
You haven't even done
your mitzvah project yet.
I did my mitzvah project.
I volunteered at the retirement home.
So you could do a mitzvah,
or so you could flirt with a boy?
How did you know that?
Let's just say there's
a wonderful woman there, Mrs. O'Leary,
who wishes to convert to Judaism,
and you never brought her bookies!
Yeah, you're not the only one
who's amazing at impressions.
I'll do better.
Let me take off
my "rabbi hat" for a second
and put on my "tough love hat."
If you don't shape up, your Bat Mitzvah
is gonna be cancelled, sis.
And that's the way
the hamantaschen crumbles. Capisce?
Yes, we understand, Rabbi Rebecca.
She doesn't really even deserve
a second chance.
We thank you for that.
[Rebecca] Mm-hmm.
Oh, and just please
calm your husband down.
Okay? Tell him don't put Andy Goldfarb
in a wood chipper.
- [Bree] She just walked in.
- [Rebecca] Oh. Okay, good luck.

No.

- [Danny] Well, welcome to being an adult.
And welcome to being Jewish.
We don't get breaks.
Oh my God! Stop!
[Danny] Kissing a boy in a temple?
You know how disrespectful that is?
Every time you walk into that synagogue,
you are declaring to everyone and God,
"I'm Jewish, and I am part of this!"
Well, maybe I don't want to be!
Yes, you do!
I was born into God's kingdom!
Yeah? Well, God wants you out right now!
How's that?
- I hate you!
- [Danny] You don't mean that.
Wow, I never said that to him,
and I was nuts.
- [Danny] You hate me?!
- [knocking on door]
[Stacy] I do. You're a jerk,
and you won't let me have a mojito bar.
Gabi!
Hi!
[Danny] That's why we fought the Nazis?
So you could have a mojito bar?
Is this a bad time?
- Um, no. What's... what's going on?
- [Danny] Are you nuts?
Well, Stacy was supposed
to do that video for Lydia's Bat Mitzvah.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course, right.
[Stacy] Get out of my room!
Stop ruining my life!
- Anyways...
- [Danny] I paid for this room!
She never sent it.
I was in the neighborhood, and thought
I'd pop by and see if it was ready.

[Stacy] You'll be the reason

[Danny] Same here!
Hard.
Very, very stressful.
[Danny] Good God!
Um, I think that Stacy said
she finished the video this weekend,
so I can just email it to you ASAP.
Thanks. Lydia keeps talking about how
she doesn't wanna have a video anymore.
- I know she'd regret it.

Lydia's Bat Mitzvah is coming up,
and I really don't know what to do.
I'm not even sure if she wants me there.
- [girls laughing]
- [kids clamoring]
[Stacy, continuing] If I was in
this situation a month ago,
I would've asked my friends what to do.
Hey, look, we're twinning.

I'm hanging out with now,
I don't know
if they'd have such good advice.

In the Jewish religion,
I am supposed to be a grown-up today.
But I have been so selfish and bratty

[Stacy, narrating] And then, it happened.
The very day I was supposed
to become a woman
is the day that everything started
to make sense.
...Nikki, Tara...
When you're a kid, you think it's okay
to put yourself in front of your friends
in pursuit of something better.
A woman knows there is nothing better
than your friends.
...Kym, Megan, Anya...
[Stacy, narrating] When you're a kid,
sometimes you think you have to be
someone you're not in order to fit in.
...if I'm being honest, it's probably 'cause
we were, like, jealous or something...
But a woman knows
it's not about hiding who you are.
It's about being yourself
and speaking your truth.
...but also, you guys can be,
like, such a-holes sometimes.
[crowd gasping]
Keep it PG in the temple.
Sorry.
Where'd she learn to curse like that?
No idea.
[Stacy] And the biggest difference
between being a kid and an adult...
Andy...
...is knowing what really matters.
I'm gonna keep it brief 'cause I know you
can't focus on one thing for that long,
but you're basic and not nice to people,
and if I'm being honest,
not that good at soccer.

And worst of all, because of you,
I ruined my friendship

[doorbell ringing]
[panting] Lydia.
Lydia.
Lydia, please open...
The Andy stuff.
I know you never hurt me on purpose.
I should have let you apologize.
I miss you, and I love you, and I'm sorry.
I've been a horrible, selfish friend.
Please, please forgive me.
Stacy, you ruined my Bat Mitzvah.
What part of that do you not understand?
I don't under... Like...
- I know.
- Let me finish.
That day at the ledge,
I told you not to go.
I told you don't jump. You jumped.
Then the whole thing
ended up being my fault.
- Then I was the shitty friend?
- I'm sorry.
And I've known you liked Andy for, like,
a million years, but guess what, Stacy?
So has every other girl at our school,
including me,
but I never told you anything
because I knew it'd just make you upset.
And then, when you uninvited me to the day
I've been helping you plan forever,
I dated him to make you mad.
Until you ruined it.
Then you ruined your best friend's
most important day of her life.
So, yeah, I'm... I'm done here, Stacy.
Wait, you're right.
Yeah, I know.
Just come to my Bat Mitzvah party tonight.
I promise it'll be worth it. Please.
[dramatic music playing]
I'm gonna take that as a maybe.
Hello, again.
["Post Humorous" by Gus Dapperton playing]
Honey?
Hi, Mom.
[Bree] Your father called in
a lot of favors.
I think it's gonna work out
if she shows up.
Come on. Let me do it.
I know tonight's not exactly
what you dreamed it would be,
but I'm really proud of you.
Okay, go.
[both smacking lips]
[Bree] There.
[objects clattering]
- [Stacy] Hmm.
- Gorgeous.
[in accent] Thanks, doll.
[Stacy chuckling]
- I have something for you.
- Okay.
[Bree] Okay, now,
I know you may not like this, but...
[gasping] Really?
Thank you!
[Stacy groaning]
I think I'm gonna wear sneakers.
Oh my God, you're a woman.
You're a smart woman
Let's party!
[crowd cheering]
[dance music playing]
[door opening]
[Bree] Is she here?
[exhaling] I don't think she's coming.
Honey, she's gonna come.
[Schmuley] May I have your attention?
It's starting. What if she doesn't come?
Then everything's pointless.
[door opening]
[Danny] It's not pointless.
- I could've been working on my golf game!
- Oh, you're fine.
You made it.
I made it.
Perfect timing.
Just in time for your grand entrance.
[Schmuley] Listen guys and girls,
ladies and gentlemen...
No, Lydia...
Please give a very sweet welcome
to your Bat Mitzvah
Lydia Rodriguez Katz!
[Stacy] It's time for yours.
Stacy, what is this?
You deserve a perfect Bat Mitzvah.
One that no one ruins.
So you gave up your Bat Mitzvah for me?
Stacy, this was your dream.
It's our dream.
Stacy!
Yeah, Lydia! We love you!
We love you!
Go!
Okay.
[Stacy] Entrance. Beautiful.
[Schmuley] Lydia! Lydia! Lydia!
[crowd] Lydia!
[Schmuley] Come on, Lydia!
Go, Lydia!
[dramatic, uplifting music playing]
[Schmuley] All right! Make some noise
for Lydia and Stacy!
[crowd cheering]
- I'm not paying for this, right?
- Yeah. You are.
I'm kidding you. You're good. We got this.
- [Schmuley] Let's get this party started!
- Oh man.

[Mateo] Hey.
Do you want to dance?
Well, what about Isabella?
Who?
Your 25-year-old girlfriend back
in Ecuador?
I just assumed her name
was something glamorous like Isabella.
I don't have a girlfriend.
You know, it's a weird rumor
I don't understand.
Oh.
[gasping] Ooh, how do you feel about that?
Your daughter's dancing
with a handsome young gentleman?
Um, surprisingly, I feel okay with it.
Really?
- You know what I don't feel good with?
- What?
- Rabbi Rebecca and Cantor Jerry.
- [Bree gasping]
[Danny] What is that?
[Bree] Ooh, work it, Rabbi.
Yeah. That should be against
every religion right there.
- Yeah. [laughing]
- What are they doing?
{\an8}Okay, that's enough of the slow stuff.
- Let's make some noise everybody!

Dear God, Stacy Friedman here.
So today, I'm an adult,
and honestly, it's wonderful.
I know this is just the first chapter
of my grown-up life,
and it might not always be this great,
but if it was, that would also be great.
I mean, no pressure.
Not like I could pressure you.
Just saying.
[uplifting music playing]
And I know what you're thinking,
that giving up my party
for Lydia was my mitzvah project.
But that's not a mitzvah.
That's just being a best friend.
