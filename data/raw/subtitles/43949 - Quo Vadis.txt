Whither goest thou, lord?
Whither goest thou, lord?
Quo Vadis Domine?
Whither goest thou, lord?
Quo Vadis Domine?
Whither goest?
Whither goest thou, lord?
oh lord, oh lord!
oh lord!
oh lord!
oh lord, oh lord!
Quo Vadis Domine?
Whither goest thou, lord?
Whither goest thou, lord?
Quo Vadis Domine?
This is the Appian way,
the most famous road that leads to Rome
as all roads lead to Rome.
Here march her conquering legions.
Imperial Rome is the centre 
of the empire,
an undisputed master of the world.
but with this power
inevitably comes corruption.
No man is sure of his life.
The individual is
at the mercy of the state.
Murder replaces justice.
Rulers of conquered nations
surrender their helpless subjects 
to bondage.
High and low a like become 
Roman slaves, Roman hostages.
There's no escape
from the whip and the sword.
That any force on earth
can shake the foundations
of this pyramid of power and corruption,
of human misery and slavery,
seems inconceivable.
But 3 years before this day,
a miracle occurred,
on a Roman cross in Judea.
A man died to make men free,
to spread the gospel
of love and redemption.
Soon that humble cross
is destined to replace
the proud eagles that top
the victorious Roman standards.
This is the story
of that immortal conflict.
In this, the early summer in 64 A. D.
in the reign of the anti-Christ,
known to history as the emperor Nero.
The victorious 14th legion 
returns to Rome,
under the command
of one Marcus Vinicius.
We can see Rome from the top of the hill.
Well, there it stands,
Rome.
Three years is a long time.
Yes, Marcus.
Drusilla and the children
Tonight I sleep at home.
Man of the family to the end.
It's not sleep I'll look for.
We’re  being given an escort.
The least they could do.
Hail Marcus Vinicius,
in the name of the divine Nero.
The news of your brilliant victories
has preceded you to Rome.
We’re  anxious to be there.
Lead us in.
I'm sorry, commander.
I have imperial orders.
A fine welcome after
a three-year campaign!
We’re  ordered to camp here.
How many days' wait?
-I only know the orders.
-Rome loves her brave warriors!
Give that man 10 lashes!
And double it for any more complaints.
Make camp here.
out of the way!
Where to, Marcus?
To the palace! Where else?
Commander Marcus Vinicius.
I request audience with the emperor.
I will report immediately.
Commander, sir, if I might presume,
did you fight the Britons
With a mass movement, or...
We fought with our bowels!
Yes, commander.
Well, now you have it as I composed it.
Now, from the beginning.
ohooohhh
o lambent flames
o force divine
o omnivorous powers hail
omnivorous.
omni potent. omni potent, yes.
omni potent power hail
Seneca, isn't omnipotent better?
Far better, divinity.
There's no conviction in your voice.
You disturb me.
Petronius, you’re  
my arbiter of elegance.
Which is it? 
I find omnipotent most feeble.
In fact, puerile.
Puerile?
Feeble?
Omnivorous has your pure 
inspired imagery.
It is vivid, comprehensive.
A genius, divinity, should hold 
to his first thoughts,
on any subject.
Dear Petronius, what would I do
without your clear insight into...
Aah! clumsy toad!
Isn't the agony of my creating enough
Without you carving me?
Take her away.
Where was I?
What now?
Commander Marcus Vinicius
wishes an audience.
Marcus? Here?
-Who is Marcus Vinicius?
-My nephew, divinity,
Just returned with his legions.
Bid him enter.
You sent word to Vinicius
to remain outside the city.
That's true, Tigellinus.
Does your nephew consider
that his conquests give him a right?
I cannot believe
that he entered with his army.
Doubt less he has come to pay homage
to his emperor and his god.
Yes.
Yes, of course. I fear that 
a natural humility
often blinds me.
Yes.
Hail Nero, emperor.
Commander, hail.
Come forward.
Your uncle was explaining
your impetuous devotion to me.
It's a joy to be such an inspiration.
My loyalty and my life always.
My men have fought for their emperor.
They've accepted weeks 
of forced marches.
They’re  anxious to see
their families, their women.
Just as you said, Petronius,
 such loyalty.
The delay in reaching home
it's a question of morale.
Didn't you explain? Maybe 
good Tigellinus left the reason
out of his orders.
Reasons are not given 
in imperial orders.
Tigellinus, how boorish!
We desire that you wait
to join legions, coming 
from Africa and Asia,
which should be soon.
Tomorrow you'll enter in triumph.
The people need diversion
or shall we say that this, too,
Is a question of morale?
They demand a spectacle.
Bear with me in this, dear commander.
I understand now.
Divinity, may I retire with my nephew?
We have much to discuss.
Naturally. I shall expect you 
at the feast,
after the triumph, Vinicius.
An added honour.
Now, again.
No arms missing? No legs?
I picked up a healthy slash.
You seem to be faring well.
Oh, indestructible!.
You'll spend time with me?
I intend a full month’s 
relaxation in Rome.
I purchased several delectable slaves.
There’s one from Spain skin like cream,
hair that shines like a young raven's.
-She's yours.
-I might stay two months.
Tonight you’ll stay at Plautius' 
country place.
Aulus Plautius, the retired general?
That's a gloomy out look.
And his wife’s not young.
Still, it's better than a tent.
o lambent flames...
I've been listening to that since noon!
He seems in rare voice.
Is it true that he murdered
his wife and mother?
You must learn the language
of privileged government.
They were removed
for the good of the empire.
The new wife, Poppaea,
sounds interesting.
A harlot for an empress.
What an observation! A woman 
has no past,
when she mates with a god.
Well, he's our emperor.
Want to replace Nero with 
general Galba.
I know nothing of politics.
While there’s money to pay the army,
Rome will stand forever.
I bid you welcome, Marcus Vinicius.
I salute the general.
We travelled the splendid 
roads you built.
My wife, the Lady Pomponia.
We’re honoured to have you.
My tribune, Fabius Nerva.
These men must wish to wash.
The baths are ready.
This way, commander.
Dinner is at the ninth hour.
You’re  expecting other guests?
We’re  not intruding
on any festivities, I hope.
No. We live a quiet life.
"No. We live a quiet life. "
We’re  making ourselves 
sweet-smelling flowers,
only to bloom in a hayfield.
The oldest boy is almost 
as tall as Drusilla.
When I left, I carried him 
on my shoulder.
That little slave from Spain,
she can sit on mine.
Speaking of things that grow,
Look at this one!
For your bath.
Stand up, fellow.
What a prospect!
What's going on in the arena?
Is Croton still champion?
I don’t know.
You mean general Platius never thought
of training you as a gladiator?
I do not fight.
With one arm strapped,
you could kill 50 Nubians an hour.
I could make you champion.
It is a sin to kill.
Half witted. He grew so fast,
his brain hit the top of the stable.
"Behold, she stands
with her gown hung loose.
"framed is her face in golden tresses
"reflecting her milk-white shoulders.
"thus Venus stood before Mars,
welcoming her lover. "
Nothing do I see that is not perfection.
You’re  in service to this household?
-Very much so.
-Your name?
Lygia. Lygia, you’re a windfall.
I shall sacrifice white doves 
to Venus,
to commemorate our meeting.
Your sacrifice will be 
in vain, commander.
The old general must know
a good slave market.
Not only beauty, but spirit as well.
There are no slaves in this household.
"Te old general..."
I have the honour and the joy
to be his daughter.
I crave your pardon.
Three years in the field
have dulled my perceptions.
Forgive me.
You've done nothing
to ask forgiveness for.
For a long time, the only women 
I’ve known
have been poor barbarians.
I've heard the women of Britain 
and Gallia
are most beautiful.
Women of Britain cover themselves 
with deer fat.
They desire to be warm.
The warmth is not transferable,
only in its aroma.
As for the women of Gallia,
their hair is like rope,
not a soft red-gold crown
with stars in it.
Their palm was a wild boar's hide.
that proves they are diligent
at building huts,
but not in bringing a man’s 
thoughts to life.
I'm not sorry at all.
-Sorry?
-That Petronius arranged my stay here.
If things go as fate surely meant,
the man should be decorated.
If you will excuse me, I must 
decorate the table.
You can understand my problem.
We were outnumbered three to one.
Easily. I put the spearmen 
in a formation
like the Macedonian phalanx.
Barbarous Britons are worthy opponents.
They impaled themselves 
on the spearheads.
We were ankle-deep in their blood.
Can you understand the strategy?
Can you see it?
I only see the necessity
of defending one’s home.
Defending?
They were in revolt against Rome,
but I credit courage.
A general's daughter can understand
it gives no pleasure
to overcome weaklings.
The battle loses its zest.
Right, general?
I find I've outgrown that zest.
You’re  being modest, general.
You’re not excited
by your legions' exploits.
That's an odd attitude
for a woman of Rome.
I am a lygian.
Lygian? I thought...
She’s our adopted daughter.
Oh, I see. Lygia, Lygia.
She was named Cellina,
but she prefers Lygia.
She was taken prisoner
during my campaign in Lygia.
-A slave, then?
-No. She was assigned to me as a hostage.
We’ve tried to erase the wrong done her
with our love.
You should envy such love.
Lygia, I envy the roof that covers you
This one or any future.
May a traveller interrupt 
with his greetings?
Paul! You’re here!
We've been counting the days.
Pomponia. Lygia, dear.
Peace is with this house.
It's written in your faces.
Our guests, tribune Fabius Nerva
and commander Marcus Vinicius.
You must have seen their army.
Ah, yes.
Our friend Paul of Tarsus.
Our very dear friend.
Don't let me interrupt your meal.
We’re  done. Let's sit in here.
Commander.
You must be tired, Paul.
Will you have food?
I supped a long the way.
The rigors of travel
fall away rapidly here.
You’re  returning from a journey?
Oh, yes. Antioch, Corinth...
Oh.
-You’re  Greek.
-No, I'm a Jew.
A citizen of Rome,
though I was born in Tarsus.
Yes, Tarsus, north of Palestine.
You come from a troublesome 
part of the world.
-You’re  a merchant of some sort?
-No, I'm a rabbi.
What in the name of Jupiter is a rabbi?
Paul is a teacher.
-What do you teach?
-He teaches...
He teaches philosophy.
Yes, I suppose you call it that.
Did you know that all this time
I've been teaching you philosophy?
I don’t know a great deal
about philosophy. Lovely women
shouldn’t have the time
to think that deeply.
Lygia, would you ever think
I'm fond of flowers?
I should like to see the garden.
You must see to the disposition
of the men.
Will you excuse me?
I shall be back early,
In time for the flowers, I hope.
Tell us the things we’ve been 
waiting to hear.
Did you see Peter? How is fishermen?
I missed him all along the way 
wherever I went,
Peter had been there before me.
At Antioch, they said he'd gone 
to Jerusalem.
Others said he'd set out for Persia.
Finally, in Corinth,
I learned he was coming here.
Peter in Rome? Magnificent!
To speak with a man
who talked with Christ, our Lord.
I saw results of seeds Peter 
has planted.
Green shoots sprouting,
there will be good harvest.
Everywhere strangers approached
and drew the sign of the fish before me.
We spoke of the great work ahead.
The work is dangerous now.
Since you were tried,
even though you were acquitted,
Christians are under constant suspicion.
I notice you seem worried
in the presence of your guests.
I would have exercised caution
There are times I bid the desire
to cry the message a loud.
But tactics must be applied,
even in the spreading of love and faith.
Your time will come.
Those two vital young men,
they are Rome. If we could teach them,
we could teach the world.
Marcus Vinicius?
You’re  asking for miracles.
I am.
I am, indeed.
There is still nothing I see
that is not perfection.
However, if you were thinking of me,
As you undoubtedly were,
do I look that much like a fish?
oh...
It wasn’t anything to do with you.
You’re  too lovely to be a lonely artist.
But I did ask you to wait up for me.
I couldn't sleep.
Nor can I.
The night's still young.
This place is unworthy
of our first meeting.
Let's go to Petronius' house.
There will be gaiety there.
My uncle’s house was built
by the goddess of love herself.
No, it's too late.
I mean, it's impossible.
We could plan it more discreetly.
You’ll come see my triumph tomorrow,
won’t you?
There’ll be a feast at the palace.
No, I don’t wish to watch your triumph.
Good night, commander.
-Tell me what is it?
-What?
What is it you see that you don’t like?
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't attracted by what I see.
It's what I hear I don’t like.
A man's fame brings him fresh enemies.
Who's been telling you stories about me?
You have, from your own lips
ugly stories of conquest.
Conquest is the only method
of uniting and civilizing the world.
Have to spill blood to do it.
There’s a gentler way of doing that,
without bloodshed and war,
without slaves and captives
bound to your triumphal chariots.
There’ll always have to be slaves.
Paul speaks of a world without slaves.
That beggar-faced philosopher
shouldn't stuff your
luscious head with such nonsense.
You can’t understand.
I wish you were a slave.
I'd have offered a price for you.
And taken me to Sicily?
On a special ship.
What a way to win a woman?
To buy her like an unresisting beast.
What false security you must have
in your manhood.
What hidden scorn
you must have for yourself!
You’re forgetting
you’re hostage of Rome.
Here, you hostage! Come back here!
No, commander.
-Move!
-I guard her, commander.
Who are you?
I am Ursus. I guarded the king, 
her father.
I guard her now.
Guard her well, my gray-haired colossus.
Guard her well.
Romance was short-lived.
There’s always a weapon to bring down
a flighty dove, my friend.
And please, dear lord,
Forgive me my anger and my spite.
I do not know what came over me.
It was temptation, perhaps,
A selfish desire that this man
might see your light,
for my sake rather than his.
Yet I pray that one day,
he shall feel the joy of your love.
I pray with all my heart.
O guardian nymph, thou keeper 
of tree and soil,
the voice of love now clear 
in the garden calls.
He comes to thee who brings 
the harvest.
Open thy arms to embrace vertumnus.
O guardian nymph,
vertumnus is calling thee!
Captain! What's the delay?
The emperor hasn't appeared 
on the balcony.
You'll hear the trumpets.
Open thy arms to his love, Pomona
Pomona, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
O goddess of earth
Mighty!
Eternal!
Beneath whose auspices
Rome rules the world!
Hear us.
We worship you!
We worship you!
Venus, goddess of love.
We worship her!
Mars, god of war.
We worship him!
Juno, goddess of heaven.
We worship her!
Jupiter, father of the gods.
We worship him!
And Nero, his divine son!
Yay! Yay!
They are impatient, divinity.
They’re  impatient?
What about my patience?
A triumph to divert them.
Who diverts me? I agonize for them! 
I have no privacy.
You are their sun.
Does the sun have privacy?
The sun has the night. They expect me
to shine daily, hourly,
For that foul-smelling rubble!
It's so hot today.
This heat of Rome oppresses me.
They demand too much!
This mob tortures me!
I hate it second only to Rome!
The foul breath of that mob 
floats in my house,
in my garden!
I wish...
-Oh, I wish...
-Your wish, Caesar?
I wish that mob had a single throat,
that I might cut it.
It could be done.
A typical butcher's solution.
Tigellinus would deprive you
of your audience.
They irk me!
Do I live for them or they for me?
As a ruler, you must have 
subjects to rule.
Population is a necessary evil,
but the burden is on you,
on the only shoulders
strong enough to bear it.
That's true, isn't it, Petronius?
It's lonely to be an emperor.
It is lonelier to be a genius.
You’re  the only one who understands 
my tortured nature.
Is that not a theme for a poem?
It is a theme for an epic, divinity,
But to write it, you must suffer it.
Yes.
Where is Poppaea? Where is my empress?
Here, lord.
Come. Petronius, you were right.
I must feel it, know it, live it.
Come, Petronius, attend me closely.
Attend me closely my ordeal.
Hail Nero, son of Jupiter!
Look at him, my darling!
Wife killer!
Mother killer!
Quiet, woman!
He's a beast!
Quiet!
No man is a beast.
Look at him and know that 
he is but sick,
sick in heart, spirit, and soul.
You are right, Petronius.
How they love me!
How, indeed!
Remember, thou art only a man!
Remember, thou art only a man!
Marcus Vinicius.
Isn't he the one who came 
to see Nero yesterday?
An arrogant man. He bears watching.
He might bear watching at much 
closer range.
Poppaea, what are you muttering about?
Come closer.
Look. They march as they fight...
Strong, brave, relentless,
our unconquerable children.
We must take them to our breast.
Yes, my lord well,
the hero at last.
Usually one’s embarrassed by relatives,
-But today I was proud of you.
-Hot work in that sun.
The emperor adores you.
He called you his brave 
relentless child.
If you play your hand well,
you can have a military governorship.
Egypt, perhaps.
Sit down.
Relax before you take your bath.
Very well, then taste this.
Straight from the vines of Olympus.
Your Sicilian vintages
will pale to nothing.
-Well?
-What's the law regarding hostages?
-Hostages?
-Can they be bought?
Well...
I take it this hostage is female.
Head to toe. What's the law?
Wait until you see what I have for you.
Ah. Here she is.
Bring her here.
Your exquisite wildflower,
from the hill s of Spain, Marcus.
-What's her name? I’ve forgotten.
-You called me Eunice.
Silence!
Ah, yes. Eunice.
Lift your chin, Eunice.
Look at that skin.
Turn around. Slowly.
Flawless proportions.
Hold your arms behind your head.
Makes one wish one were a sculptor.
Lovely.
Enough of my collector's enthusiasm.
She is the commander's now.
Take her to his apartment.
-I won't go.
-What did you say?
Don't give me away, my lord.
Don't send me from here.
Stay here, girl. I don't want you.
You don't want her?
And I refused an offer of 
six Arabian stallions.
Keep her, Petronius. She's yours.
Give her five lashes.
You won't give me away, then?
That depends on your conduct.
Yes, my lord.
Ply the lash carefully, now.
Don't damage her skin.
No, master.
Tell me now, can one purchase a hostage?
Where is this precious gem?
At Plautius ' place.
She is a fiery young lygian.
A lygian?
I do recall a child assigned to him.
It was some years ago.
How can I get her?
She belongs to Nero.
Perfect.
He can keep Egypt and give me Lygia.
Plautius may not be in accord with this.
Well, she will be.
They've sentimentalized her 
into an adopted daughter.
Philosophy teachers.
This one wasn't born to think.
She was born to feel.
Plautius regards her as his daughter.
Is this ethical?
He was a general of the empire.
I'll have her if I have to abduct her.
Is you little barbarian,
entirely in sympathy with your plan?
She'll be cooing like a pigeon.
I wish I had your confidence.
I've never discovered an 
honest warmth
in any woman.
Oh, my dear, beautiful lord,
I love you so.
Please, how can I let you know?
Open! Open in the name of the emperor!
I have an order from the emperor.
-Yes?
-My orders are to take Lygia
to the imperial palace.
She’s not a slave. She’s our daughter!
My orders are to take her at once.
Wait here.
You are the hostage Lygia?
Yes.
Welcome to Nero's house of women.
My name is Acte. I'm in charge.
Why am I here?
You have attracted
the attention of the emperor
And have been commanded to the feast.
But the emperor has never seen me.
Nero ordered you brought here,
Just as I was seven years ago.
He loved me more than he knew.
Prepare the bath, oil of lilies.
Bring me the beaded cloth
and the strand of
fine gold at the waist.
I am not honoured by this.
Weren’t you brought up
in the home of Plautius?
Yes. Do you know them?
I know of them.
Chatter, chatter.
You'd think each one 
had hair of a queen.
This one has possibilities.
What were you going to tell me?
Simply that you are the chosen 
guest of Nero.
You are in the hands
of the master of the world.
Consider that
your good fortune and fate.
The hostage, Lygia.
Aren’t you coming?
The emperor did not ask me.
She needed a poet to describe her.
Everything’s there but the smile.
I leave that to you.
Petronius is right. I wish 
I were a poet.
I had you escorted here in great honour.
Don’t I deserve a smile?
It was gracious of you.
10 big guards to support
my eagerness to come.
Guards to support...
My eagerness to come...
And you belong here, Lygia,
a king's daughter in a palace.
You should have a natural 
appetite for that.
I can tell you. You have other 
natural applets, too.
Hasn't your friend Paul told 
you about those?
Or has he been living in a cave?
You should have seen my triumph today.
I imagine they had you
chained to a peach tree.
Here. The panacea for all reticence.
You' re right. Your mouth has 
its own sweetness.
I know I'll find it so.
Don't look so frightened, Lygia.
I'm no heartless machine of war.
I won't rush upon you.
You've only to smile at me a little.
I can think of nothing
but that this is over
So you can send me home.
Home? Yes.
Hail Nero!
Hail Nero!
Hail Nero! Hail Nero!
Hail Nero!
Hail Nero!
Have you ever seen your emperor
and your god this close before?
No. I have never seen Nero 
this close before.
Same faces, same noses,
All green.
Just for variety, divine lord,
Try a ruby.
Is that the hostage
I brought for Vinicius?
Yes, divinity.
Vinicius has an eye.
She's exquisite.
You are generous.
You've over looked something for yourself.
Yes. What do you think, Petronius?
Put a dress on an olive stump,
And my untutored nephew
would call it beautiful.
I know in your incomparable judgment,
You've decided that
she is too narrow in the hips.
That's exactly what I think.
One woman should never judge another.
She hasn't the glands for it.
Isn't that witty, Petronius?
Your humour is unique.
Dear Petronius. Oh, yes,
Too narrow in the hips.
Sing for us, divinity. Sing for us!
Sing for us!
I had almost come to a tragic decision.
I had decided not to sing tonight.
My throat hurts.
And when one has a divine gift,
one should not jeopardize it.
I'm not the only one afflicted,
my empress has a headache.
The only thing which will 
bring her relief
is the sound of my voice.
You promised to sing.
I'm totally unprepared.
So I must compose as I sing.
o lambent flame
o force divine
o omnivorous power hail
None is the swifter to bring 
destruction yet,
carefree as a child.
Thou with wild breezes playing
the old Troy shall be no more 
because of thee.
Thou harvester that strips
the soil for men,
to sow new crops.
O lambent flame,
o force divine,
o omnivorous power hail.
Bravo! Bravo!
You must be content with that.
My throat.
Watch croton!
He's killed over 300 opponents.
He could destroy your nurses.
Orpheus must be as yellow 
with envy as Lucan.
I am as a candle next to the sun.
And you, Petronius, what do you say?
Your verses are common
and fit for the fire they celebrate.
Farewell, Petronius.
What defect do you find?
Your verses are worthy of Homer,
but not worthy of you.
The conflagration you describe
does not blaze enough.
Had Lucan written these verses,
I should acknowledge him a genius?
But you can create
the world's greatest work.
I say this to your eyes,
take greater pains.
The gods gave me something 
greater than talent...
A true judge and friend.
You have opened my eyes.
All men, born and unborn, 
are my debtors.
-You' re right.
-My conflagration does not burn enough.
And do you know why?
I've never seen a burning city.
You said one must suffer
an experience to recreate it.
A sculptor has his model.
I have no model.
Burn a city to create an epic?
That's carrying the principle
of art for art's sake too far.
Soon spring will be over.
The summer heat will begin.
What stenches will arise from Rome?
I shall move the court to Antium.
You did not observe Croton's 
masterful stroke.
I was not the only one.
Vinicius has hardly taken 
his eyes from her.
I must see this for myself.
It was a fair match.
Either could have won.
You seem pleased with my gift, 
commander.
Is it enough in the light 
of your service?
Do you know, lovely one?
No. I thought you should tell her.
I have given you to Marcus Vinicius,
as a reward for his devotion to me.
Your guardian is no longer 
general Plautius.
You belong to the household of Vinicius.
On closer inspection,
I find it a fair reward,
perhaps excessive.
Except, of course, as you so 
wisely observed, divinity.
Oh, yes.
Too narrow in the hips.
Let us go and greet my guests.
Now you know, Lygia.
And I thought I could love you.
Love as you were made to love.
What difference does it make,
now that you own me?
You have but to give the command.
I own you. You realize that, don’t you?
I can have you flogged
until you plead to love me.
Take me then. Take me to your 
house. Anything.
You will hear nothing from me,
but a prayer.
-Lygia
-Commander Vinicius,
The empress requests your 
presence at once.
Very well.
Here.
Take her to the house of Petronius.
Put her in charge of Anaxander,
master of s laves.
Tears are but a prelude to joy.
Remember that while you wait for me.
You seem to be having difficulty
in proving your ownership.
Mares often enjoy fighting the it.
I've always found conflict
between man and woman,
a waste of time.
It consumes so much... vitality.
Well said, empress.
I am a priestess of Amino.
You are a serpent,
poison is in your mouth,
And I have a taste for poison, Marcus.
To change to a serpent,
that might take time.
I can bring that about.
Those are commander Vinicius ' orders.
Here.
Oh, how clumsy of me!
I know your symbol
Even though I'm not yet one of you.
Have courage, child.
Come along. Your fate is determined
by the greatest power in this world.
His will be done.
You must get sleep.
I'll call you.
We should be hearing from Ursus soon.
Good morning.
-You' re right.
-We'd better ignore the formalities.
Tell Lygia I've come for her.
We've not seen Lygia.
-Bring Lygia here at once.
-We haven't seen her.
You're lying, general.
I don't lie.
On my oar as an officer,
I do not lie. You may search the house.
You refuse to say anything more?
You've violated our hospitality,
in the cruellest way a man could.
You' re over looking our law 
of outages, aren't you?
The emperor assigned Lygia to my care.
You' re overlooking what's 
happening to Rome.
It's such laws that will tumble 
its foundation.
Your emperor, your god, Nero,
bathed in his own infamy.
Plautius, my dear, please,
I understand your concern.
I hope I continue to forget
what I just heard.
Marcus.
My dear young Marcus.
I want to call you that,
because for all your rank,
woman of my age isn't unaware
of things. You could be my son.
Lygia's eyes were drawn to you.
If deep inside of you,
you were this cold.
Look into your heart
and recognize the truth
of you that should be.
Since you returned empty-handed,
sit down and fill your empty stomach.
They claim to know nothing.
Forget the whole whim and come 
to Antium.
There's something strange 
about Plautius
And that household. They don't 
talk like Romans.
Their friend Paul of Tarsus...
Paul of Tarsus?
Yes. He's some fool philosopher 
I met there.
Paul of Tarsus.
My poor Marcus.
This is drama to the ages.
You picked the cherished egg,
in a nest of Christians.
Christians have spirited her away.
Christians? Are they the ones
Who worship some dead carpenter?
Yes. A rebel against the state,
a Jew called Christ,
crucified in Palestine.
The sect is a secret one.
It consists of Jews, Greeks, and others
who meet in secret and spread 
their superstition.
They’re a constant worry
to Nero and the senate.
This calls for a detachment 
of praetorians.
I'll tell Taglines to sear well,
Now wait.
These Christians are resourceful.
A display of force
will bury your hostage
deeper in the nest.
-Do you suggest I join the group?
I know of a Greek, a man 
called Chilo.
He's a soothsayer,
astrologer, and diviner of mysteries.
He'd show the way
to your escaped Lygia before nightfall.
-Anaxander?
-Yes, master?
You know the house of Chilo?
Yes, master.
My nephew has urgent business.
Escort him.
Your advice has certain merit.
I'll give your Greek a chance.
If you find her, bring her to Antium.
I'll send you word.
You have heard, Eunice?
Is not love a madness?
Do not ask me, lord.
I'm among the mad.
Do you love someone?
It was once prophesied 
by an old woman,
that both pain and happiness 
would visit me.
That prophecy applies to everyone.
She said my true fate was hidden 
in a rhyme.
Well?
"Anon shall Venus rise
"from out the violet roman sea
"and bear two lovers
In her arms towards eternity. "
Whom do you love? Anaxander?
Mirmillon?
Well, your beloved is not of 
this house.
He is, my lord.
What if I said that today
you should go with me
to the violet Roman sea?
I'm swoon with happiness.
Only you haven’t said it, my lord.
Then go ready yourself for Antium.
You haven't swooned.
I have no time, my lord.
I have no time!
I have no time!
I vow you've come to the right man,
Marcus Vinicius.
Speak up! Can you find this girl?
I must first verify she is a Christian.
My lord, do you read Greek?
-Passably.
-Look here. What does that say?
"Jesus Christ, son of god, saviour. "
Exactly.
So it's their dead god’s name.
I've seen no such symbols. Observe 
the first letters of each word.
What do they spell?
I-c-t-h-u-s.
Icthus. The Greek word for fish.
Have you seen the symbol of 
a fish in all this?
Fish. Why should I have seen a...
Wait. She once drew one.
Aha! Their sign of recognition!
Fish are caught with a bait,
-Christians with a fish.
-Where are their gatherings?
They practice foul rites at 
night in caves.
Will they gather tonight?
Possibly, but it is dangerous.
There are hundreds of them.
Croton the gladiator will 
protect you.
-Does that suit? Croton? 
-Yes, lord.
We'll meet you here at sundown.
But, my lord, I shall need, other arms.
A small weapon in advance, perhaps?
Jesus lord, sweet Jesus
Kyrie Eleison.
On us thy children
Christe Eleison.
Have mercy, lord
Holy saviour...
You see how they gather, lord?
In stealth, like thieves and murderers.
Holy saviour
Shed thy light on our darkness
Shed thy light...
-He was at her house.
-Yes. She's here.
I baptize thee in the name of the father
and of the son and of the holy ghost.
-What's he doing?
-They call it baptism,
an evil bath of blood water.
I know there are some here
who still doubt,
a few who have not accepted baptism.
Our lord Jesus understood that.
He welcomed questions
as the right of free men.
But there is one among us tonight
who was there when the people 
gathered about Christ.
And questioned him,
who heard the answers from his own lips,
A man who saw Jesus' face
and touched his hand,
The fisherman Simon, called Peter,
our Lord’s first apostle.
Unworthy though I am,
Jesus said to me, "thou art Peter,
And upon this rock
I will build my church."
He has guided me to Rome,
so that together we can build 
his church here.
I give thanks for your 
faith in him,
Whose voice you have heard 
in your hearts.
By the sea of Galilee,
my brothers and I had fished 
all night
and had caught nothing.
We were cold and tired.
Coming into the shore, I heard 
someone call my name.
A man stood there.
At the sight of him,
the cold and weariness left me.
I answered "Yes, friend?"
He asked to come into our boat,
so that he could speak better
to the people on shore.
We made him enter.
He spoke to the people,
about the Kingdom of Heaven.
Suddenly, my heart leapt in my breast,
and I knew that he was the Christ.
He said to me,
"Go out into deep waters
and let down your nets. "
In a moment, the nets were full.
He looked at my wonderment and said,
"From henceforth, you shall be 
a fisher of men. "
He told me to follow him, and I did,
I and my brothers James and John.
Throughout the land, we followed him.
Others joined us until we were 12.
To the hungry and thirsty,
he gave food and drink.
To those, who were sick and 
worn and weary,
he gave hope and peace.
Who but the Son of God,
could have brought such gifts to man
or have commanded the storm to be calm.
Who or he could have raised
Lazarus of Bethany from the dead
and given peace to Mary Magdalene?
And yet I... denied this man.
He himself foretold that I would
on the night of our last supper.
"Lord, " I had said,
"I will follow you
to prison and to death. "
But he answered, "Peter, 
before the cock crows,
thou Shalt deny me thrice. "
And I did, three times
outside the house of his judges,
when they accused me of 
being with him,
I said, "I know not the man",
cursing my weakness in 
the face of death.
Then they weighed him down,
with a cross and scourged him,
and at Calvary, they crucified him
with a crown of thorns upon his head.
But even then Jesus said,
"Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.
Only the son of God
could have forgiven them,
as he forgave me.
But he who raised the dead
could not be conquered by death.
The room in which we later sat
was filled suddenly with light
and the risen lord stood before us.
We saw his pierced hands 
and wounded side
and we knew that he was the Lord.
He said, "Peace be unto you. "
He commanded us to preach his 
holy word.
"Blessed are the poor in spirit,
"for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are they who mourn,
for they shall be comforted.
"Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.
"Blessed are they which
do hunger and thirst after righteous
"for they shall be filled.
"Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.
"Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.
"Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they shall be called
"the children of God. "
Jesus also asks us
to obey the commandments
which god gave to Moses.
Obey those who govern you
and the laws by which they govern.
Even though under them
you suffer cruelties,
Witness maliciousness.
Make no threat of violence
great in returns.
In the words of Jesus,
"whosoever shall smite
thee upon thy right cheek,
"turn to him the other, also.
"Love thy neighbour as thyself.
"Whatsoever you would
that men should do to you,
"do you so to them.
"Love your enemies.
"Bless them that curse you.
"Do good to them that hate you
and pray for them
that despiteful use you
and persecute you. "
Oh, believe in him!
Endure all things in his name,
so that you may dwell 
in blessedness
from ever lasting to ever lasting.
-Amen.
-Amen.
By the light of the dawn on a glorious,
endure all things in his name,
That you may dwell in blessedness.
In his triumph, the son of god arose...
If I smite him on one cheek,
he will have no chance to turn the other.
I don't know. He has courage.
Come to our house to see Peter and Paul.
No. We may be watched.
Good night, father. Good night, mother.
Christ is king
Christ is king
Alleluia
There. There she is.
Lift your eyes and your hearts,
to the glory on high,
of the lord who arose on...
Well, commander?
-Come along.
-He shall reign,
he shall reign eternal.
That giant looks like he has 
the strength of a certain bull.
Can you down him?
I'll squeeze the seeds out of him.
Wait.
We' re being followed.
-I don't hear anyone.
-They stop when we do.
Go on to the house.
-But father.
-Go on to the house.
Go no further, commander.
-Step aside.
-My lord, you haven't paid me!
It's only a small cut in the scalp,
but they always bleed the most.
Hot water.
I'll get some ointment.
Look! Did you do that, too, Ursus?
No, dear, that's an old scar.
What from?
Probably some battle wound.
Right. He's one of Nero's 
best generals.
It's time you were asleep.
Mother, did you see...
Yes, dear.
Wash the wound thoroughly 
first, Lygia.
Yes.
Come, Ursus.
Ursus wishes to speak to you.
Yes?
I want to ask the commander's 
forgiveness.
I killed his friend.
You killed Croton?
I told you you'd be a champion.
-And the Greek?
-He disappeared.
I’ll wager he did.
Please forgive him.
For what? Croton faced his chances,
killing was his profession.
But why didn't you kill me?
In our faith, killing is a sin.
I seem to remember.
You should have had him kill me,
But instead, you bring me in 
and patch me up,
You who hate me.
You've defeated me, Lygia.
Go on home. Stop hiding.
I won't pursue you about the 
countryside any longer.
You' re free and rid of me, Lygia.
You could look happier about it.
Well, so be it.
Marcus!
Oh, Marcus, you know I don't 
hate you.
Lygia!
Oh, Marcus, Marcus!
The sweetness of you.
This is the beauty. I knew it.
I should have known it had to happen,
when I watched you leave the gathering.
You were there?
Yes. I should have known what 
I really wished.
Will you give me
the greatest triumph a man ever had?
Be my wife?
Oh, yes, Marcus!
Gather up what you need and 
let's be gone.
-Hurry!
-Yes, Marcus, I'll hurry.
Petronius will out do himself.
A wedding such as never has 
been seen
and even that will be lost moments.
Marcus, I would like to ask 
Paul’s blessing
and let him say the words over us.
Enough of his words!
They've deafened your ears,
to everything life has to tell you.
Did you hear Peter and Paul 
say anything wrong?
I heard a childish old man 
speak in riddles.
Believe as they do and you’ll 
think an ox is a goat.
Marcus, dear, I thought having heard,
You might begin to understand why.
Is this the symbol of your god?
The cross on which he was crucified.
I'll accept your god, if it 
makes you happier.
I don't demand it.
In our gardens in Sicily,
we'll put up a cross higher 
than the roof.
I'll have a figure of your Christ,
carved from the finest marble.
Marcus, listen.
It's no trouble. There's such 
an army of gods nowadays,
we can find room for another.
It's not a condition of
our having one another.
I just pray that one day,
Christ will appear in your heart.
My heart is only for you.
There won’t be room for him.
There will be.
I always carry him in mine with you.
Well, take him out, if he means 
that much!
Well. I'm glad to see you 
on your feet again.
We were quite concerned.
Paul, Marcus just asked me 
to be his wife.
Oh? I'm sure that this has brought 
her great joy, Marcus.
You could see, Paul, that I loved him.
I was trying to explain
that there are other things...
-I understand.
-I don't!
I offered to accept the symbols 
of her god.
I don't ask her to accept mine.
What more can I do or say to prove
I'm not an enemy of her god.
Marcus, for some of us,
it takes years of thought,
of contemplation,
of looking back on our lives.
Tell me what more I should do.
You own slaves, don't you?
Hundreds. Why?
Jesus wishes no man to be in bondage.
-Set them free.
-Set them free? But they’re mine.
You can't buy human beings.
Faith in Christ is based on love.
He asks everyone to love one another.
You want me to love the 
whole human race?
Love Parthian, Egyptians, Persians,
and others who want to kill me?
Has it occurred to you to put 
down your sword
and conquer these people with love?
Yes, you'd tame wolves with a feather.
You’ve a whining beggar for god,
a cringing god for slaves and 
outcasts like yourself.
But that's not Lygia.
Let's leave this idiocy of 
words, Lygia.
-Marcus, a moment more.
-We've waited long enough.
You’re going to be commander 
Marcus Vinicius' wife,
not some crucified carpenter's 
slave.
Marcus, try to understand
My faith, my beliefs.
Don’t force me to choose.
-You mean between me and your Christ?
-Yes, choose
Because I'd no more share you 
with your Christ,
than I would with any other man!
But, Marcus, unless you try 
to understand,
What we feel for each other 
will destroy itself.
Destroy us!
Your love for Lygia, though great,
Is small compared with your love 
for mankind.
What sort of love
acknowledges a force greater 
than itself?
What runs in your veins, blood or water?
What sort of poison are you spreading?
You coming with me, Lygia?
Lygia?
No, my dear.
Twice today but I'll keep my word.
I'll not disclose what I've 
seen or heard.
Something is hidden behind 
your meek words, philosopher.
They strike at Rome and roman law.
I warn you. If ever Roman rule 
is threatened,
you'll feel my sword.
I almost...
I wanted to go with him, Paul!
Lygia.
Even our lord knew temptation.
Your strength, too, will prevail
and be rewarded in this.
I know that.
Fearful is my soul,
here as I lie,
in the arms of my love
Heart beating on heart 
through the night
Why is it that we knowing 
infinite love
must die?
This will be the imperial garden
Where the cattle market now stands?
Yes, divinity.
Each palace rising out of its own lake,
surfaced with rare waterfowl.
No longer will the stench of cattle
rise up the palatines lopes,
landscaped with roses.
Phaon, you could have laid 
the plans of Olympus.
My lord, I have brought food.
Take it away.
Since morning.
Be gone with it, all of you!
You irritate me!
Why do you stare at me, Acte?
My lord...
I- I-I can only say,
when all this sets with the final sun,
Remember the look of Acte.
Why should I?
No one loves you as I do.
I command you to stop loving me!
I cannot, lord. Forgive me.
For years, she has been 
a thorn in my flesh.
Now that thorn will be removed.
You are banished from Rome
and from my sight.
One day, Nero, you will need me...
Is it not disgusting, when 
common bovine solicitude
replaces the fire in a woman's body?
But what pulsating pull there 
is in fire!
My new Rome shall spring from 
the loins of fire,
A twisting, writhing, breathing flame.
What do you think Petronius will say?
You doubt his approval?
I, too, remember his strange look,
when the thought first came to you.
No. No.
Petronius appreciates my genius.
He may not understand the means
I must use to bring
this greatest of my a
accomplishments into being.
He seems to be well-occupied 
at the moment.
When I have news of Tigellinus' coming,
I shall summon him with the others.
This must be disclosed to him,
with intelligence,
with, uh, with sincerity.
