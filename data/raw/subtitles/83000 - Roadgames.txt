LAST MOTEL IN TOWN
AGAIN, EH, BOSWELL?
IT'S NOT
EXACTLY THE RITZ,
BUT IT BEATS SPENDING
ANOTHER NIGHT IN THE TRUCK.
WE'LL GET SOME NICE CLEAN
SHEETS AND A HOT SHOWER.
THEN WE'LL HOP
INTO A RESTAURANT,
GET SOME NICE CHOW,
A LITTLE PATE FOIE GRAS,
VEAL SCALOPPINE,
DRY MARSALA.
WE MIGHT EVEN GET
A DISCO DOLLY FOR DESSERT.
I WON'T FORGET
THE DOGGY BAG.
SALACIOUS VARMINT.
BASE 4 TO GYPSY
3-9er-7.
BASE 4 TO GYPSY,
DO YOU COPY?
OH, GOD. SHALL WE?
BASE 4 TO GYPSY
3-9er-7.
MAYDAY!
THIS IS FLIGHT 77.
I'M GOING DOWN!
HELP! OVER.
IS THAT YOU,
GYPSY 3-9er-7?
NEGATIVE, DARLING.
THIS IS QUID,
PATRICK ANTHONY QUID,
AS IN BRITISH
STERLING. OVER.
3-9er-7,
THERE'S A PRIORITY URGENT
FROM PERTH.
MELVIN MEATWORKS,
5 A.M. OVER.
NEGATIVE. I HAVEN'T SLEPT
SINCE WEDNESDAY.
I'M HALLUCINATING. OVER.
DON'T TRUCK DRIVERS
TAKE PILLS FOR THAT?
I DRIVE A TRUCK.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
A TRUCK DRIVER.
IS THAT AFFIRMATIVE?
THERE'S A STRIKE
IN THE WEST.
THEY NEED MEAT.
SWEETHEART,
THERE SEEMS TO BE
A LOT OF
INTERFERENCE HERE,
BUT I LOVE YOU.
I ALWAYS HAVE. OVER.
WHY DO WE ALWAYS
HAVE TROUBLE WITH YOU?
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL GO DOUBLE TIME.
AFFIRMATIVE, BASE 4.
5 A.M., MEATWORKS.
DOUBLE TIME.
OVER AND OUT.
HEY, BOSWELL.
ISN'T THAT THAT YOUNG FOX
WE SAW HITCHHIKING?
WE SHOULD'VE
PICKED HER UP.
NOW HE WILL GET HER.
USE SMITH OR JONES.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
WHO CARES NOWADAYS?
LET'S GO.
COME ON.
OH, GOD.
FIRST HE STEALS MY GIRL,
THEN MY BED.
OK, BOSIE,
IT'S YOU AND ME, PAL.
NOW, LISTEN,
NO SNORING
AND NO EVIL SMELLS.
I HOPE SHE STEALS
HIS WALLET.
SHE PROBABLY WON'T WAIT
TO TAKE HER SOCKS OFF.
[WHIMPERING]
BOS!
HEY, BOYS.
I HAUL IT IN,
YOU HAUL IT OUT.
WITH FULL,
DEVOUT COURAGE,
OF SUNDRY FOLK,
BY ADVENTURE FALL
IN FELLOWSHIP,
AND PILGRIMS
WERE THEY ALL.
GOOD MORNING, PILGRIMS.
MORNING. ME THINKETH IT
ACCORDANT TO RESOUND
TO TELL YOU ALL...
HELLO. BEEN AWAY
ON HOLIDAY, EH?
LOVELY.
HMM...THE WARRNAMBOOL.
FRED FRUGAL
AND HIS WIFE FRITA.
FRITA FRUGAL.
BET SHE'S A REAL DRAGON.
YOU SHOULD'VE TURNED RIGHT
AT THE LAST LEFT TURN.
POOR GUY.
BET HE'S AN ACCOUNTANT.
MAYBE A SCHOOL TEACHER.
NO...
AN ACCOUNTANT.
WATCH IT, KIDS,
OR YOU'LL STAY IN
THAT POSITION FOREVER.
THERE'S A MAN WITH BALLS.
BENNY BALLS.
BOSIE, THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THE AUTUMN AIR
THAT SETS THE GYPSY
BLOOD ASTIR.
IT'S SNEEZY RIDER.
HORS D'OEUVRE?
[HUMMING]
BOSIE,
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
MAYBE I SHOULD
PICK HER UP,
DAZZLING HER WITH
MY STYLISH RHETORIC.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
NO?
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS.
ALL RIGHT, MATE,
THAT'S NINE JAP TRAPS
AND THREE VWs,
WHICH BEATS
YOUR ROLLS ROYCE.
WANT TO QUIT?
TAKE 2 EXTRA POINTS
FOR THE TRAILER, OK?
OK, OK. MAKE IT 3.
I WON'T ARGUE.
YOU AUSTRALIANS TAKE
YOUR GAMES TOO SERIOUSLY.
AHOY! CAPTAIN CAREFUL.
DOWN TO THE SEA
IN A SHIP, EH, MATEY?
[HONK HONK]
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BOSWELL?
SOMETHING WRONG?
WELL, WELL.
IF IT ISN'T OUR FRIEND
FROM THE MOTEL.
HEAVE TO, FRIEND.
I'M OVER YOUR PORT SIDE.
[HONK HONK]
[WHIMPERING]
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
SOMETHING ABOUT
THAT VAN?
WONDER WHY
HE DOESN'T PASS.
MAYBE HE'S AFTER
OUR MEAT, HUH?
I WONDER IF THAT FOX
IS WITH HIM.
WELL, LET'S GET
A BETTER LOOK.
WHY DOES ANYBODY
GET UP AT 5 A.M.
TO WATCH
THE GARBAGE COLLECTORS?
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]
THE TIME IS 1:00.
THE WEATHER IS
CLEAR AND STABLE.
HERE'S THE NEWS--
A COUNCIL WORKER
IN THE BRISBANE SUBURB
OF EAGLE FARM
DISCOVERED A HUMAN HAND
IN A STORM WATER DRAIN.
THE HAND WILL BE COMPARED
WITH THE HUMAN LEG
DISCOVERED IN TOWNSVILLE
LAST WEEK.
POLICE ARE DENYING
SPECULATION
OF A JACK-THE-RIPPER-TYPE
MURDERER AT LARGE,
CLAIMING THE TWO
GRISLY ITEMS
ARE PROBABLY UNCONNECTED
AND ISOLATED.
WELL, WELL.
...WHO IS THE PRINCIPAL
ANTAGONIST IN THE STRIKE,
WHICH HAS LEFT PERTH
WITHOUT MEAT.
THE FEDERATION
HAS ASKED ANYONE
KNOWING THE WHEREABOUTS
OF MR. DAY,
WHO'S BELIEVED
TO BE RETURNING WITH HIS FAMILY
FROM THE NEVADA CARAVAN PARK--
SUCKER.
HELLO THERE.
WAIT A MINUTE, MISS.
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO PICK UP HITCHHIKERS.
I'M NOT HITCHHIKING.
MY IDIOT HUSBAND
DROVE OFF,
LEAVING ME HERE.
WE CAN CATCH HIM
IF YOU HURRY.
ISN'T THIS COZY?
SO HIGH UP.
BET I GET TRUCK-SICK.
I'M MADELYN DAY.
IT'S A PLEASURE.
FLOYD,
MY IDIOT HUSBAND,
CALLS ME SUNNY,
SUNNY DAY.
SOUNDS LIKE A WILD
AND CRAZY GUY.
WE'VE GOT A DAUGHTER,
DORIS DAY,
LIKE THE MOVIE STAR.
WE CAN GO NOW,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
I CAN TAKE YOU
AS FAR AS YELLOWDINE.
YOU CAN PHONE THE POLICE
FROM THE ROADHOUSE.
DOES YOUR DOG BITE?
HE'S NOT A DOG.
IT LOOKS LIKE A DOG.
HE'S A DINGO.
DINGO?
WHY KEEP A DINGO?
I LIKE HIM.
HE'S QUIET.
A DINGO'S
LIKE A DOG,
SO WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?
A DOG IS
A PARASITE HYBRID--
HE BARKS AT SHADOWS
AND EATS HIS FECES,
BUT A DINGO'S CLEAN,
INTELLIGENT, QUIET.
HE'S PHYSICALLY
INCAPABLE OF BARKING.
THEY CALL HIM
"THE SILENT DOG."
HE'S AN ARISTOCRAT...
LIKE ME.
ARE ALL TRUCK DRIVERS
SO STUCK-UP?
DRIVING A TRUCK
DOESN'T MAKE ME
A TRUCK DRIVER.
YOU AND YOUR WOLF,
ABOVE IT ALL...
ARE YOU MARRIED?
NO.
AREN'T YOU
PICKING HER UP?
THAT HITCH WILL
MAKE PERTH BEFORE US.
SUCH LANGUAGE.
NO,HITCH.
A GENTLEMAN
WOULD HAVE STOPPED,
WITH THIS MANIAC
RUNNING AROUND...
WHAT MANIAC?
ON THE RADIO.
YEAH, GO ON.
JUST SOME MANIAC.
DID THEY DESCRIBE
HIS RIG?
I DIDN'T MENTION
A RIG.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
MY HUSBAND WAS
AN ACCOUNTANT?
JUST A GUESS.
HOW FAR AWAY
IS THIS ROADHOUSE?
NOT FAR.
GOOD.
WE HAVE
AN ACCIDENT HERE.
WE'RE CLEARING THE ROAD.
PLEASE PULL OVER.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
SHORT CUT.
WAIT. I'VE GOT IT.
THE HOOCHIE-KOOCHIE
DOLL.
IT'S MINERAL,
NOT ANIMAL.
I'VE GUESSED EVERYTHING
IN THE TRUCK.
MAYBE IT ISN'T
IN THE TRUCK.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
YOU WANTED
TO PLAY GAMES.
GIVE UP?
YEAH.
IT'S YOUR BOOTS.
MY BOOTS?
LEATHER IS
AN ANIMAL PRODUCT.
MY BOOTS ARE
IMITATION LEATHER.
THEY'RE VINYL,
THERMOSPLASTIC RADICAL,
WHICH MAKES THEM EITHER
MINERAL OR VEGETABLE,
BUT CERTAINLY
NOT ANIMAL.
SO I WIN.
BUT YOU GAVE UP!
OK, OK, OK.
IT'S MY TURN.
UM...ANIMAL.
THAT FLY THERE.
IF YOU WON'T PLAY
PROPERLY, FORGET IT.
IS IT THE FLY?
YES, IT'S THE FLY,
BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
NARROW IT MORE LOGICALLY.
OK, HERE'S
ANOTHER ONE.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
IT'S REALLY EASY,
JUST A PLAIN
ORDINARY ANIMAL.
OK, BUT NO TRICKS.
IT'S BIGGER
THAN A BREAD BOX.
ME?
NO.
- BOSWELL?
- NO.
- IT MUST BE YOU.
- WRONG.
IF THERE'S AN ANIMAL
INSIDE THIS TRUCK, YOU'D BETTER
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
I NEVER SAID IT WAS
INSIDE THE TRUCK.
PIGS?
NO.
KANGAROO?
NO.
EMU?
NO.
THE NULLARBOR NYMPH?
LAWRENCE OF
FRIGGING ARABIA?
THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU GIVE UP?
YEAH.
THAT MAN BACK THERE.
I DIDN'T SEE ANY MAN.
YOU WERE ARGUING.
HE WAS BY
A GREEN VAN,
DIGGING A HOLE.
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING?
I TOLD YOU,
DIGGING A HOLE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S WRONG?
SHH!
WHAT THE HELL
WAS HE BURYING?
IS THIS
ANOTHER GAME?
WHY DOES A MAN STOP
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
AND DIG A HOLE?
MAYBE HE NEEDED,
YOU KNOW, A TOILET.
LADY, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.
THIS SAME GUY PICKED UP
A HITCHHIKER LAST NIGHT.
THIS MORNING, HE WATCHED
GARBAGE BAGS BEING COLLECTED
OUTSIDE THE MOTEL.
NOW HE'S BURYING
MORE GARBAGE.
DOESN'T THAT
SEEM WEIRD?
YOU TRUCKERS
TAKE DRUGS, DON'T YOU?
YOU'VE GOT THE DDTs.
"CAST TO THE WIND
THY GHASTLY SIN."
PARDON?
THAT'S IT.
THE GHASTLY SIN
IS DISSIPATED,
ERASED FROM EXISTENCE.
AND ANOTHER THING--
A BODY WOULDN'T LAST
HALF A DAY OUT HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
I'M TALKING ABOUT SEX!
SEX STOLEN FROM
A YOUNG GIRL
IN THE BACK OF A VAN
OR A SEEDY MOTEL.
I'M TALKING ABOUT GUILT--
TERRIBLE GUILT,
AWFUL GUILT.
A GUILT SO TERRIBLE
IT CAN ONLY
BE OBLITERATED
BY SPREADING THE EVIDENCE
ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE.
JESUS!
I WANT
OUT OF HERE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT EXACTLY DID
THEY SAY ON THE NEWS?
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.
YOU'RE THE AUTHORITY
ON WEIRDOS.
HELP ME OUT.
IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
JACK THE RIPPER, OR--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I'VE GOT A GAME.
I'M NOT INTERESTED.
IT'S ANIMAL.
NO!
IT'S BIGGER
THAN A BREAD BOX,
BUT IT'S SMALL ENOUGH
TO FIT IN A PLASTIC
RUBBISH BAG.
THAT'S A SICK GAME!
IT WOULDN'T FIT ANYWAY.
IT WOULD IF YOU
CUT OFF THE--
STOP IT!
HEY, LADY!
LADY!
LADY, STOP!
I'M NOT GOING
TO HURT YOU, I PROMISE.
YOU STOPPED ME
ON THE ROAD, REMEMBER?
I'M JUST
A TRUCK DRIVER.
I'M GIVEN TO FLIGHTS
OF IMAGINATION,
BUT THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE AFRAID OF ME.
LET'S GO BACK
TO THE TRUCK, OK?
WE DON'T
WANT TROUBLE.
WE NEVER
WANTED TROUBLE.
THEY THREATENED
MY CHILDREN.
THEY KILLED OUR DOG.
THE POLICE SAID
THE STRIKE
WAS FLOYD'S FAULT.
WE'VE GOT OUR OWN
PROBLEMS, MISTER.
I DIDN'T SEE
ANY MAN BACK THERE,
UNDERSTAND?
YEAH, I THINK I DO.
NO VANS,
NO LUNCH BOXES,
OR ANYTHING TO DO
WITH POLICE.
AND NO MORE GAMES.
ALL RIGHT.
NO MORE GAMES.
HELLO?
I'M TRYING TO REACH
THE NEAREST POLICE STATION.
HOLD ON A SECOND.
[PUTTING COINS IN BOX]
MY NAME IS QUID,
AND I'M CALLING
FROM YELLOWDINE.
SORRY. YELLOWDINE.
RIGHT.
I MAY HAVE INFORMATION
REGARDING THOSE MURDERS
YOU'RE INVESTIGATING.
YEAH.
NO, NO. MY NAME IS QUID.
QUID?
PATRICK QUID.
Q-U-I-D.
QUID.
AS IN POUND NOTE.
I'M A TRUCK DRIVER.
A TRUCKIE. RIGHT.
LISTEN, I MAY HAVE SOME--
HELLO?
HELLO?
UH, SORRY, SORRY.
I WAS SAYING, UH--
WELL, I...I--
I THINK WE'VE GOT
A BAD CONNECTION HERE.
I'D RATHER NOT GET INTO IT
OVER THE PHONE.
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT MY NAME IS?
I CAN'T STICK AROUND.
I'VE GOT A LOAD OF MEAT
THAT, UH--
IT HAS TO DO
WITH THIS BUSINESS
ON THE NEWS ABOUT, UH--
WHAT?
MEAT.
PIGS.
NO. I'M CARRYING
MEAT, MATE.
M-E-A-T, AS IN MEAT.
IT HAS TO DO WITH A GUY
IN A DARK GREEN VAN.
WHAT?
IF YOU'LL JUST HOLD ON
AND LISTEN FOR A SECOND.
HAS ANYONE SEEN A GUY
IN A DARK GREEN VAN?
THANKS.
I'M SORRY, UM--
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
A GUY IN A GREEN--
[JUKEBOX PLAYS]
HOLD ON A SECOND.
WOULD YOU KILL
THAT MUSIC, PLEASE?
HELLO.
WHAT?
NO, IT'S QUID.
"Q" AS IN
QUARTERMASTER,
"U" AS IN UTOPIA,
"I" AS IN ICE CREAM.
I-C-E-C-R-E--
OH, JESUS.
I CANNOT
STICK AROUND.
I'VE GOT TO GET
MY PORKERS TO PERTH.
IT'S Q-U-I-D!
"D" AS IN DEATH
TO YOUNG GIRLS!
EXCUSE ME.
THAT YOUR DINGO?
YEAH.
THERE'S A BOUNTY
ON THEM IN THIS DISTRICT.
HE'S JUST A PET.
WE'RE TRAVELING
ON THROUGH.
NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
TO THE LOCALS.
THEY SHOOT THEM
ON SIGHT.
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO
BREAK THE LAW, WOULD YOU?
BOSWELL!
BOS!
[WHIMPERING]
BOSWELL,
WHAT HAPPENED?
SON OF A BITCH!
[HONK]
WHAT THE HELL--
[HONK HONK]
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HIM?
IF THAT'S HOW
YOU WANT IT.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
WHAT DO YOU SAY, BOSWELL,
THIRD TIME, LUCKY?
AREN'T YOU KIND OF YOUNG
TO BE HITCHHIKING?
AREN'T YOU KIND OF OLD
TO BE PICKING ME UP?
IT'S NOT A PICKUP,
JUST A LIFT.
I DON'T USUALLY
PICK UP HITCHHIKERS.
WHAT MAKES ME
THE EXCEPTION?
I GUESS I JUST
FELT SORRY FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WERE ANY
CHIVALROUS
TRUCK DRIVERS.
OH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR DINGO?
YOU DIDN'T SEE A GUY
IN A GREEN VAN?
YEAH. WHY?
WONDER WHY HE
DIDN'T PICK ME UP.
YOU SOUND DISAPPOINTED.
HOW OLD ARE YOU
ANYWAY, HITCH?
OLD ENOUGH.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
OLD ENOUGH
TO BE YOUR FATHER.
MY FATHER'S 67.
MAYBE HE MAKES LOVE
TO THEM FIRST.
HITCH, DOES YOUR FATHER
KNOW YOU HITCHHIKE?
MY NAME ISN'T HITCH.
DOES YOUR MOTHER
KNOW YOU'RE GONE?
SHE'S DEAD.
MY FATHER LIVES
WITH A WHORE.
YOU RAN AWAY?
I WALKED AWAY.
YOU SHOULD
LET HIM KNOW
YOU'RE OK.
THAT'S HOW HE
GETS HIS ROCKS OFF.
YOUR FATHER?
NO. YOUR MR. SMITH.
MAYBE HE MAKES LOVE
TO THEM AFTERWARDS.
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE DOES IT?
DON'T GET
CARRIED AWAY.
IT'S THE MOST FUN
I'VE HAD ALL AFTERNOON.
OK. I'VE GOT A GAME.
GOOD. SCRABBLE.
CALL IT THE SMITH
OR JONES GAME.
SOUNDS INTERESTING.
LET'S ASSUME THERE'S
A METHOD TO HIS MADNESS,
THAT EVERYTHING HE DOES
IS LOGICAL, RIGHT?
HE'S KILLED A GIRL.
DID HE MAKE
LOVE TO HER?
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT
HE THINKS OF WOMEN.
IT'S MY GAME.
IT'S THE METHOD
WE'RE INTERESTED IN.
HE KILLED THIS GIRL.
HOW DOES HE DESTROY
THE EVIDENCE?
CUTS IT UP.
YEAH, BUT WHY?
UM...
SO THE PIECES
WON'T BE FOUND.
BUT PIECES DON'T
PROVE ANYTHING.
AN ARM OR LEG
PROVES NOTHING.
YOU CAN LOSE
AN ARM OR LEG
WITHOUT BEING DEAD,
BUT IF YOU
LOSE YOUR TORSO,
YOU'RE
DEFINITELY DEAD.
YOU'VE
DEFINITELY HAD IT.
BUT ONE TORSO
IS LIKE ANOTHER.
FOUL.
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
WHAT HE DOES.
WHAT DOES HE
THINK OF WOMEN?
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO
GET INSIDE HIS HEAD?
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HE THINKS.
HE THINKS
WOMEN ARE PIGS.
BUT WHY?
I THINK YOU
HAVE MORE FUN
SITTING HERE
WITH YOUR STEREO
AND YOUR
AIR CONDITIONING
AND YOUR DINGO.
YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.
YOU ALWAYS
DONE THIS?
AT YOUR AGE,
I WAS FIRST MATE
ON A GUNBOAT
IN THE PERSIAN GULF.
JOHN BLOODY WAYNE.
BY THE TIME I WAS 30,
I WAS TRANSPORTING GUNS
ACROSS THE SUDAN BORDER.
NOW YOU'RE PUSHING
PIGGIES TO PERTH.
HITCH, YOUR FATHER
MIGHT HAVE THE COPS
OUT LOOKING FOR YOU.
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
OH, YEAH?
[SIREN]
WOULD YOU
STEP DOWN, PLEASE?
WHAT YOU CARRYING?
PIGS.
YOU ALWAYS PICK UP
HITCHHIKERS?
NO.
YOU PICK ONE UP
LAST NIGHT?
THE MELBOURNE
CAR HOTEL MANAGER
CLAIMS YOU CHECKED IN
WITH SOMEONE
FITTING THE DESCRIPTION
OF A MISSING PERSON.
ME?
YOUR NAME WAS
ON THE REGISTER.
ANYBODY COULD'VE
COPIED MY NAME
OFF THE TRUCK.
WHY WOULD ANYONE
WANT TO DO THAT?
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT GIRL?
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HER?
I DON'T WANT
TO GET HUNG
FOR SOMETHING
I DIDN'T DO.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
DID YOU TELL THEM
ABOUT THE LUNCH BOX?
OH, SURE.
WHERE WERE YOU
A WEEK AGO
LAST SATURDAY?
PORT HEDLAND.
AND THE SATURDAY
BEFORE THAT?
UM...
I WAS LAID UP OVERNIGHT
IN MELBOURNE.
THE LOGBOOK
CONFIRMS THAT.
LOGBOOKS
CAN BE CHEATED.
BOOK OF LIES
THEY'RE CALLED, RIGHT?
IS THIS ABOUT THE THING
ON THE RADIO?
CATCH UP WITH THE GUY
IN THE GREEN VAN.
ACCORDING TO THIS,
YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD
A 12-HOUR STOPOVER.
YOU DON'T RESPECT
THE LAW, DO YOU?
WELL...
IF THAT YOUNG LADY
COMES TO ANY HARM,
WE'LL KNOW
WHO TO TALK TO.
IT WASN'T ME.
TALK TO
THE MOTEL MANAGER.
HOW LONG YOU HAD
THAT DINGO?
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS.
WHY?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DIDN'T THEY
BELIEVE YOU?
I'M LUCKY THEY DIDN'T
SHOOT BOSWELL.
DO THEY KNOW
ABOUT OUR FRIEND
IN THE VAN?
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
I GET IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS?
WE'LL HAVE TO
GET HIM OURSELVES.
ELEMENTARY,
MY DEAR WATSON,
EXCEPT OUR FRIEND
COULD BE ALL THE WAY
TO PERTH
OR TIMBUKTU.
YOU TELL EVERYBODY
THIS STORY,
NOW YOU WON'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
NOPE, NOT TODAY.
WHY NOT TODAY?
I'M NOT TRYING
TO LAY A TRIP ON YOU,
BUT WE'VE GOT TO STOP
FOR THE NIGHT.
WHY?
REGULATIONS.
"NOTHING BESIDE REMAINS
"AROUND THE DECAY
OF THAT COLOSSAL WRECK,
"BOUNDLESS AND BARE,
ALONE AND LEVEL SANDS
STRETCH FAR AWAY."
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY PLACE?
IT NEEDS WORK.
I ONLY KEEP IT
TO IMPRESS THE LADIES.
I'LL BET
THEY'RE IMPRESSED.
FIRST STOP
ON THE PAT QUID
GUIDED TOUR.
HITCH, YOU CAN LEAVE.
CALL ME A CAB?
I'M PAMELA,
NOT HITCH.
PAMELA WHAT?
THAT'S ALL
YOU NEED TO KNOW.
WHAT'S THE MYSTERY?
ARE YOU ON THE LAM?
IF I WAS, WOULD YOU
TURN ME IN?
ME? NO.
WELL, I'M NOT.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO HIDE?
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER.
MOST GIRLS ARE
SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER.
YOU'RE NOT
JUST SOMEBODY'S.
QUICK.
YOU'RE NOT WHAT I'D CALL
THE TYPICAL HITCHHIKER.
THAT LOOK IS NOT
EARLY SALVATION ARMY.
SO COME ON.
WHO'S YOUR DAD?
COME ON.
I PROMISE I WON'T
HOLD IT AGAINST YOU.
HE'S IN THE DIPLOMATIC
SERVICE, LET'S CALL IT.
AND YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THE SERVICE?
LIFE WAS INCREDIBLY
DIPLOMATIC IN CANBERRA.
NOW YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A LITTLE ADVENTURE?
I COULD GO
TO DISNEYLAND
FOR ADVENTURE.
I'M LOOKING
FOR EXCITEMENT.
AHA.
WHAT IS
THIS PLACE, ANYWAY?
IT'S AN OLD
TELEGRAPH STATION.
THERE USED TO BE A TOWN
OF 700 PEOPLE HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THEM?
THEY WERE DEVOURED...
BY THE DREADED
ORYCTOLAGUS CUNICULUS.
SOUNDS EROTIC.
LISTEN.
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY.
YOU CAN HEAR HIM
OUT THERE...MUNCHING.
IS HE ANIMAL,
MINERAL, OR VEGETABLE?
OR IS IT MAN,
ADVANCING LIKE AN ARMY
OF PLASTIC DENTURES,
DEVOURING HIS FELLOW MAN?
AND WOMAN.
AND WOMAN.
THANK YOU.
WHAT IS A...
CUNIC--
CUNICLUN.
CUNICULUS.
WHAT IS IT?
A RABBIT...
A BUNNY RABBIT.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
IN THE 1800s,
THERE WAS A PLAGUE
OF RABBITS.
THEY ATE ALL
THE VEGETATION.
THE SAND DUNES ADVANCED,
SO EVERYBODY LEFT.
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
I LIKE IT HERE.
RABBITS?
YOU'RE WEIRD.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
HITCH...
PAMELA...
WATCH OUT
FOR THE BUNNIES, HUH?
[THUNDER]
HELLO?
HELLO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
KEEPING THE
PASSENGERS COMFY.
SHUT THE DOOR.
YOU'LL LET
THE COLD OUT.
"GOOD-BYE,
YOUNG PORKERS.
GOOD-BYE,
AND KEEP COLD."
AAH!
"DREAD 50 ABOVE
MORE THAN 50 BELOW."
HOW YOU DOING?
OK.
ROBERT FROST.
HOW DID YOU SLEEP?
I CAN SLEEP
ON A FENCE POST.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
OH...
"SLEEP NOT,
DREAM NOT.
THIS BRIGHT DAY
WILL NOT, CANNOT
LAST FOR AYE."
EMILY BRONTE.
RIGHT.
READ MUCH OF HER?
YEAH.
IN SCHOOL?
NO. SELF-EDUCATED,
MORE OR LESS.
WHAT'S THAT EXPRESSION?
"EDUCATION IS
HANGING AROUND
LONG ENOUGH--"
WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS DO THAT?
DO WHAT?
TALK IN POEMS.
DO I?
POEMS ARE OLD
AND DUSTY.
YOU'RE NOT
OLD AND DUSTY.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
TOO OLD.
I DON'T THINK SO.
WHAT'S THAT?
"PIG IN A POKE,
YOU BETTER
START SHAKIN'.
TODAY'S PIG IS
TOMORROW'S BACON."
T.S. ELIOT?
HI, DADDY. IT'S ME.
NO. I'M FINE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE I AM. I'M FINE.
HELLO, NANCY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"GET RAPED"?
HE'S ACTUALLY
A VERY NICE GUY.
YES, HE IS
A TRUCK DRI--
LOOK, I DIDN'T CALL
TO GET YELLED AT.
I WANTED TO LET
YOU KNOW I'M FINE.
[ALARM SOUNDS]
NO, I'M NOT
COMING BACK.
NOT NOW.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER,
ALL RIGHT?
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE WAS DIPLOMATIC.
MY STEPHOOKER
WANTED TO KNOW
IF I'VE BEEN
LAYING TRUCKERS.
SEE WHAT
I'M UP AGAINST?
WELL, THEY KNOW
YOU'RE ALIVE.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
GOT TO USE
THE LADIES ROOM.
QUID?
HERE.
EXCUSE ME, UH...
WAIT HERE.
KIND OF CAUGHT YOU
WITH YOUR PANTS DOWN,
DIDN'T WE?
BUTCHERING YOUNG GIRLS
IS ONE THING,
BUT WHEN YOU
HURT MY ANIMAL,
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE,
YOU MISERABLE STINK?
WORD TO THE WISE, SHITHEAD.
YOU TRY ANYTHING FUNNY,
THIS DOG WILL EAT YOU.
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO WAY OUT,
EXCEPT DOWN THE S-BEND
OR THROUGH ME, COWBOY.
I'M TALKING TO YOU,
SMITH, JONES,
OR WHATEVER
YOUR NAME IS!
AH-CHOO!
OH, I'M SORRY, MATE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS
SOMEBODY ELSE.
I APOLOGIZE, REALLY.
HITCH.
GO TO THE TRUCK,
BOSWELL!
AH! AH! AH!
WHAT THE--
SHIT.
BOSWELL.
LOOK OUT, MATE.
LOOK OUT.
WATCH THAT DINGO.
HE'S VICIOUS!
GO STRAIGHT
FOR YOUR CROTCH,
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.
AH! AH! AH!
IF YOU READ ABOUT THIS
IN THE PAPERS,
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT
IT'S ABOUT.
YOU GOING TO GO
FOR HIS CROTCH?
THAT'S FUNNY.
HE'S SLOWING DOWN.
MAYBE HE'S OUT OF GAS.
MAYBE THIS IS
SOME NEW KIND OF GAME.
SHE DOESN'T LOOK
TOO KIDNAPPED TO ME.
WHAT IS SHE DOING,
PSYCHOANALYZING HIM?
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S STUPID ENOUGH
TO BLACKMAIL HIM?
WELL, I...
I DON'T KNOW, BOSIE.
MAYBE WE'VE BEEN BARKING
UP THE WRONG TREE.
[HORN HONKS]
I TOLD YOU
WHEN WE PICKED HER UP,
"SHE IS TROUBLE."
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT.
I HOPE SHE STEALS--
AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T
GET MY WALLET.
WELL, SHE'S ALL YOURS,
MR. SMITH
OR FREAKING JONES.
WHATEVER YOUR GAME IS.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT
ON HIM ANYWAY?
WHAT DO WE
KNOW ABOUT HIM?
WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY ZILCH.
IS IT AGAINST THE LAW
TO DIG A HOLE
IN THE DESERT?
IS IT A CRIME
TO HAVE A LUNCH BOX
AND THUMP DINGOS?
WHAT DOES THAT PROVE?

SOMETHING'S
WRAPPED AROUND
YOUR AXLE.
