Get lost
Forget her, she's always playful!
This is how someone should ask me out
A plain card
And when I open it, just three words saying 'I love you, Aruvi'
The feeling when you read those words...
That is love
But why plain?
How could you describe love with words?
Useless!
Don't worry you'll be alright.
Teacher said it was compulsory, pa
I asked you to get the money ready by Monday, didn't I?
Did you study?
Somewhat.

Sorry pa
Do you know how long we have been worried?
Hey! Aruvi, wait!

What is it?
Did mom say something?
Don't believe anything mom says.
Why are you doing this to me?
- He's my brother!- Come here!
Send this wretch away somewhere, we don't need her.
Let's just think she eloped.
- Karuna didn't even wish me for my birthday.- Shut up
Is it that important?
Okay, it's not important.
Kill me then.
She's speaking ill about me to him
- I didn't say anything wrong.- I wasn't talking to you. - Aruvi!
Aruvi shut up.
Come here.
If you were innocent you would have committed suicide when I didn't trust you.
You wouldn't be fighting with us.
Look at you.
Isn't it obvious?
We can't tolerate this any more.
Get lost.
- Dad- Bye
- Aruvi- Bye
Bye
Come out
How long will you take?
What would the rest of us do?
Did you see a green coloured panty somewhere?
That's your bag right?Can I check?
You know Geetha?
Her green panty is missing it seems
She's been creating a huge ruckus
What can I do for her missing panty?
She brought the whole place down for that
She has been cursing the panty-thief
You should have heard what she said finally
She said 'I can't look up everyone’s skirt, please return it'
Emily is afraid of none I told her clearly
"Look Geetha, Emily minds her own underwear, and doesn't steal..
she isn't interested in others' panties"
Wasn't I right?
Where is Arulmani sir's office?
Women self help group (NGO)
They'll teach you tailoring in ten days,then you can do it yourself.
You'll be paid 3000 Rs per month
Make sure you don’t take unnecessary leaves.
Thanks sir.
[Yours truly](A famous TV Show)
Within a concrete jungle
The oven is on the road
Amidst the untidy crowd
Is the cheer of life
The cheer of life
The cheer of life
The heart has a thousand desires
Desires know no boundaries
In a world of money, life ceases to exist
Money is not the way to happiness
Lets travel to the place less traveled
Lets taste all that kindles our taste buds
If its a crime to live in a world of crimes
Take it hard on the one who blames!
The heart has a thousand desires
Desires know no boundaries
In a world of money, life ceases to exist
Money is not the way to happiness
These men!
They may even overlook  Aishwarya Rai (Actress)
but they never fail to ogle at a transgender.
Are we that beautiful?
8000 Rupees
Father had a heart attack
It'd be really helpful if you lend her1 Lakh Rupees for father's surgery
- Sit down.- I'll return it somehow.
Listen
Don't worry at all
There is a god above.
Isn't it?
I could only manage so much.
Would they allow me to visit dad?
What the hell?
You think you can join us by giving money?
I can take care of my dad.
Our relatives are coming.
You please leave this place without causing any trouble
Words of love are uttered not only by parents.
There is no god to rescue at times of distress
Oh fools who trust these useless gods
Worth earning for this tasty food Learn to travel around
If its a crime to live in a world of crimes
Take it hard on the one who blames!
Emily Run!
You know where all he pinched me ?
With wheels on our feet
Blindfolded with eyes wide open
Our loss of honour
We willfully forget our loss of honour
We forget willfully
We spin like a top
We run with a narrow vision
Have we explored the skies?
Have we scaled the depth of the hearts?

And solutions, a hundred thousand
For the people who seek change
Everything told here is the truth, and nothing else
That Uncle forcefully made me watch porn
What's with caste?
For having entered the classroom,they feed my kid faeces.
I am a prostitute! I accept it!
But I'm ready to take up a job if offered
That's truth, we don’t need her any more
I will even tolerate my husband’s demise, madam
But hundreds and hundreds of Indian fishermen die everyday
Does anyone have the guts to question it?

The stage that cures your pain Over here, in "Yours truly"
The government has made the whole society addicts

But I cannot help falling in love
Why did you kidnap my daughter?
She came with me willingly
The media ripped the issue of the girl raped in Delhi
In the same country 2,20,000farmers commit suicide
Which media reports that?
She is a woman who ran away to marry a low caste
Why should I not kill her?
Every student graduates only with marks

I could do nothing about it
I've lost everything for one morsel of rice in the refugee camp

Dear Viewers,
We don't know what kind of a society we are living in.
In this 21st century,
Women have achieved in all aspects
Man and woman are equal. We believe that there is no more patriarchy.
But in today's program, you will see the height of male chauvinism.
Today, in our program, we have an educated, beautiful and young girl.
She is now abandoned and homeless.
The tears of this girl makes all our hearts skip a beat!
We are the branches that seek the roots of the problems.
What is the solution to her problems?Lets get started with our program.
(Phone rings)
Cut
(Abuses) I had asked you all to switch off.Whose mobile is it?
Sir. It's madam's phone.
Bring that girl here.
How many times have I told you to put it on silent mode? Give it.
Your are on next. Be confident.
I am not coming to the airport.I am at a shoot.
One minute.Sir?
What time will it get over sir?
Its only a single episode.We'll finish it by 4.
Please wrap up by 3.30 sir.Got some work at home.
OK. We'll manage.
Fine I'll be there. Meanwhile you go pick her up.
Also, I have to change Srini into another school.
No no no. I am going to put my kids only in Billabong.
OK see you soon. The shot is ready.
Bye.
Madam...
This is Aruvi.
Look here dear, you don't have to be nervous while taking to a famous artist like me.
Consider me as your own sister and share your problems. OK? Sit down.
Lip gloss.
Aruvi, Make yourself audible
Ready sir
Ready.
Peter, where are those 3 men?
They are ready. They are sitting inside.We can call them when required.
OK.
Ready. Silence
Ready madam
- Roll- Rolling sir.
Action.
Sir cut, cut.
- What's your name?- Aruvi.
Ready sir.
- Roll- Rolling sir.
Action.
Aruvi.
Beautiful name.
You look beautiful too.
When you sit on that sofa, you must speak only the truth..
You must not lie
So tell me.
Why are you here?
I had a small misunderstanding with my parents.
So I moved away and now I am staying with a friend.
Friend? Girl friend or boy friend?
A transgender madam.
Nothing wrong.
These days transgenders are treated badly in the society.
Madam, you are getting into unnecessary matters.
We'll talk about that some other time.
So tell me.
What happened?
3 men, madam. Initially they were good to me.
They cared for me knowing that I was away from my parents.
I never expected they would do this to me.
They made use of the situation, got closer and finally cheated me.
Who are those 3 men?
How do you know them?
One of them is my classmate’s father.
Then a healer who performs his Upanyasa healing in the temple.
Finally my boss, who gave me a job when I was struggling.
What are you saying?
I can't believe this.
Dear viewers...
Is it possible for a girl to lead an independent life away from her parents?
Looks like the society says 'NO'.
She is unable to fight back.
In the name of love and affection and disguised as a dad, brother and honest person they have cheated her.
The 3 men are here.
Let's analyze and investigate.
This is Saahithya Wet grinder presents 'Yours Truly'

We'll be back after a commercial break.
Cut.- OK madam
Where is Subash?
(Abuses)
Where did you go without offering tea here?
You told me not to be inside the sets.
Being logical is it? Go.Get us some tea.
Get ready with those three men.
Peter come let's explain madam what to be done.
Madam, here is the next part.
Madam, the three men will be seated.You have to fire them.
Ask if they take women for granted.
If we trigger their anger, we can then turn the tables on this girl.
Logically, if she has been with three men,then she definitely is not a holy virgin.
Fire her too. She will cry.She will blame men.
The 3 men will get aggravated.
One of them might even slap her.
Don't mind. Let the quarrel carry on.
We will step in if it goes out of control.
Till then, please fill up by pacifying them.
Try to get their emotions out.
Sir, please wrap it up and leave me by 3:30.
OK madam.
She charges 30,000 for the4 hours she spends here.
What is it ?
Sir. Coffee.
(Abuses) I asked for tea.
Don't forget. Please do not use the name of your political party.
Hey Peter !Get out of the frame

Saahitya wet grinder presents, 'Yours truly'
Greetings.
Tell us about yourself
Greetings madam.
My name is Arulmani
I am in the real estate business.
I am a secretary of the party VMK
I do a lot of social service with the intention of helping the needy.
Madam, enough of his stories
- So, you are into social service.- Yes madam
Having done such good things,how could you cheat a girl?
Aruvi and her transgender friend came to my office seeking help.
I enrolled them in the tailoring classes.
And paid them a salary of 3000.
She was regular for three months.
Suddenly one day, she said that her father was ill and wanted to do a by-pass surgery.
She wanted a Lakh for the operation.
I helped her. I have never seen her after that.
When a helpless girl asks money for her father’s treatment, you could've refused.
With what intentions did you help her?
I am not here to nod at whatever you say.
I have never asked about the money till date.
We know why you helped her and why you haven’t asked the money from her!
- What do you know? You call a man of good status and insult here.- Please keep quiet.
Dear Viewers, lets listen to the other two.
- Greetings.- Greetings. Sit down.
Tell us Swamiji. You look saintly.
(Chants a slogan)
I am one who sees happiness and sorrows alike.
I am a follower of Lord Balaji.
Venakatapuri Shri BhadriSheshadri Dheekshidhar
I do Upanyasams.
In our history, spirituality and medicine are intervened.
The Americans have learnt half of it and inventedreflexo therapy, touch therapy and many others.
All these methods use touch as a form to heal.
I do this part time using the traditional methods.
OK Swami.
What links do you have with Aruvi?
She was a peaceful girl.
Every Friday she would visit my temple and have the sweets offered.
She would listen to my preachings.
She was very pious. One day she was teary eyed.
I told her that all humans have stress.
The reason for stress is the imbalance in our chakras.
I told her that you might have some imbalance in the chakras or hormones.
I told her that she will be alright if she attends 10 sittings of my classes, free of cost.
She also attended.
She just attended 4 classes and finally she made me come here!
In the name of spirituality, is it not wrong to have an illicit relationship with a girl?
I never did anything wrong.
We do not have any illicit relationship.
I just applied my therapy.
What do you do in the name of therapy?
She accuses that you hypnotized her and raped her.
If the doctor stops using the knife for surgeries, can there be any cure?
By God's grace, I am doing whatever service I can for this mankind.
Doubting me is as good as doubting God himself.
You are very tactical. I will get back to you.
You look worried right from the beginning.
Tell us about yourself.
Please stop sobbing and tell us.
I am Joseph Mohandas...
I am an executive manager at a Ford showroom.
My wife died in an accident5 years after marriage.
I have a single daughter, Jessy.
Do you know Aruvi?
My daughter, Jessie has stopped talking to me.
Your sin is so grave that your daughter has stopped talking to you.
Do you know Aruvi?
She is my daughter Jessie’s classmate.
She was staying at my house saying that she had issues with her parents.
She is also like my daughter.
She is like your daughter. Not your daughter and so you misbehaved.
What kind of a person are you? Don’t you need to be moral at this age?
Circumstance...Situations... Drinks....
I am not able to hear clearly what he is saying.
Ask him to speak audibly
Is he telling a story here?He is already ashamed here..
You go ahead sir...
Look at the camera and tell...
Sorry sir! We'll go for one more.
We are running through,please go ahead.
Sir, one minute.
Papathi, glycerin.
- Sir, I'm ready.- Run through
- Rolling sir.- Action
Why are you crying like an infant?
You misbehave with a girl your daughter’s age. Are you human?
Do you realise the legal punishment for this?
Madam, lets go for a break.
Dear Viewers, I am unable to control my tears thinking of the girl's plight.
She has approached us for a solution.
This is 'Yours Truly' sponsored by Sahitya wet grinder
Co-sponsored by Malavika mobiles.Exciting offers that blow you away!
After this commercial break.
Cut it.
Super madam.
Pappathi
Jeyashree, Ask the girl to meet me- OK sir
I was thinking something..
Do you know Vijay Sethupathy (famous actor)?
He is a good friend of mine.
I'm planning to do a film with him.
Do you know the place Neelankarai?
That's where the Producer's office is.
There is a role of heroine's friend. I am looking for a face just like yours.
Are you free on Saturday?Give me your phone number.
- Tell me.- 7884542501
I'll call you in the weekend.Let's see how it works.
Centre the table Basha.
Others come out of the frame.
Ready.
Madam same mood.
Silence.
Roll
Roll.
(Abuses) Stop sleeping and start rolling now.
Roll.
Rolling sir.
Action.
Aruvi. I have spoken to all three of them.
They talk as though they haven’t done anything wrong.
What shall we do? Can we lodge a complaint with the police?
Let's not do anything madam.
Let them apologize for their mistake.
How dare you! Why should we apologize?
- Keep calm.- You threaten to jail us and she wants us to apologise.
Are you kidding with us?
I'm sorry Aruvi.
Having done all wrong and you apologize!
Does everything get over if they apologize?You have come here asking for justice.
7 crore people are watching.
Ask them whatever you want to ask.They are all yours.
I do not want to ask anything.I wish to say something.
Go ahead and tell whatever you want boldly.
I am suffering from AIDS.
These are the certificates stating that I am HIV positive and my medicines.
The receipts from where I took shelter and my skin patches.
I have been suffering for 2 years.
Since they have had sex with me,I doubt they also might be infected.
I have had immunity problems from my childhood.
Two years back I was admitted at a hospital for Malaria.
They diagnosed and found that I was HIV positive.
The nature of transmission was not known.
The counselor said that it might have been transferred accidentally.
People around me thought that I got infected due to sex.
My parents and my brother only know about this.
They also did not trust me.
There were lot of problems happening with my body.
I couldn't attend college properly.
My family thought that I was a disgrace.
I was asked to leave the house.
I stayed at Jessie's house.
I couldn't stay there also.
I then stayed at an NGO camp.
That's where I meant Emily.She was also HIV positive.
Please ask them to get diagnosed soon.The sooner the better.
Sir. Its rolling. Please call out for a cut.
Cut it.
15 mins break
Why do you ask me to do as how with AIDS patients?
What if she had touched me?
It is not contagious by touch.Don't worry madam. Please.
Peter
Why did you bring her for the shoot without a case study?
She told me everything, but this!
Shut up. Damn it.
I would've become the fourth guy!
Madam. Thanks for supporting transgenders.
- Get lost. Look at your face.- Your face is worse than mine!
Sir, the episode is going good. TRP is off the charts. Let's continue.
We have invited doctors to our sets to diagnose these three men for HIV.
They will conduct the tests. Lets wait for the results. Until then, a short commercial break.
- Your name?- Aruvi
- Age?- 24
- Blood group?- B+
Sign here, sir
Sir, it's already 1. I have to leave by 3.
Yes madam. Once the results are out,we'll question the girl's motive.
We shall end the episode mentioning "to be continued...". You can have you lunch and leave.
Sir, Please sit inside the room
Sir...
- Where is the doctor? Inside?- Yes he is waiting.
- Why are they sitting here and weeping. Take them inside.- OK sir.
Aruvi has been tested positive.Serious AIDS condition.
All the others have been tested negative.
How is it possible?
Either of them could have been safe.
Besides that, one needs body cuts.God is not that rude.
See you sir!
- Please inform all four of them.- Okay.
My family watches all episodes everyday.Your program is awesome.
Did you call me?
The result says that the three men do not have AIDS.
Don't giggle.
We are not going to tell anyone about this result.
Lets continue with the emotion and continue the episode for the next week.
We will reveal the results in the next episode and end it on a happy note.
Let's tell them the truth.They are all terrified.
Shut up.
Go now.
Your Highness! Go tell madam that the shot is ready.
OK sir
Let's go for the take madam.
Be furious on the girl.
Ready.
- No need of the jimmy head sir.- No need of the jimmy itself!
- Roll.- Rolling sir.
Action!
Dear Viewers, There has been unexpected twists in today's episode.
This girl has tried to infect these men with the most dreaded disease of AIDS through her relationship with them.
The tests are being conducted and before we get the results...
We have with us the three men and the cruel minded Aruvi.
Let us talk.
Tell us.
Welcome to the world of AIDS.All you three are going to die.
Shut your mouth.
Why did you do this?
Like in the Hollywood films, some bombor virus must destroy all humans.
What are you talking?Are you insane?
Why do we have to live like this?
I understand.
Please take your hands off the mic, madam.
Action
I understand that you’re mentally disturbed.
You can get cured at some psychiatric institute.
Do they admit AIDS patients?
You have put the life of three people at risk. Are you fooling around?
You speak so casually.
Sorry ma'am. Tell me.
Speak calmly and I'll answer.
Cut.
Touch up.
Please do not sob so loudly. It is picked up by the microphone.
Tablet
Tablet
Don't piss her off by talking like this.
I asked them to apologise
But she is furious on me.
I am calm and she is the one who is screaming.
Am I screaming?
She wants to bomb the place, and spread viruses!
You bring some maniacs and take my life out.
OK Madam. Cool
Lets go for the take.
- Roll.- Don't keep barking sir.
Sir
- What is your problem sir?- Test result?
Please sit down. We'll let you know.
Don't take our lives!
- Sorry sir. A minute.- OK madam
Roll
Rolling sir.
Madam, rolling.
I know!
Miss Aruvi. You have ruined the life of three men.
Why have you spread AIDS to them?
I didn't spread it to them.Two of them had raped me.
They dug their own grave.What can I do for that?
Why didn't you tell them that you have AIDS?
I didn't feel like telling them.
What an answer is this? Had you told them, they could've been saved.
How?
How is it? I'll kill you!
You seem to be addressing her like a child.
I am not. Am I not questioning her?
You both please don’t fight unnecessarily.
Ask them to apologise.
You can answer the questions I pose.
What sort of a girl are you?You are brute.
Why do you ask them to apologize as though you are a holy virgin?
Citing your dad's illness, you got laid for money, isn't it?
Yes!
So?
I don't trust in the concept of being a holy virgin!
What can a girl do if she is cornered?
He touches his daughter’s friend when she is asleep
He hypnotizes and uses the patients who trust him
He touches the girl who asks for help.
How do you expect them to be treated?
Spit on them? Slipper them?Use pepper spray?
But what’s the use? Will they spare me after that?
Won't this politician finish me off?
Would he have helped me with One Lakh,had I told him that I have AIDS?
I did what I could.
Do you understand?
Instead of making these men apologize,you question a girl's chastity!
What kind of a woman are you?
I'll break your teeth!
How dare you talk like this?
If you die, should all the others also die?
Do you know what is life?Do know the value of life?
No!
Madam, no problem. Let's go for a break.
Madam, let's go for a break!
Let's go for a break.
Do you trust in God?
No
If you had trust in God, you would be scared to do something wrong.
You would've realised the value of life.
You don't have a family and so you are being like this.
It is disgusting.
Dear Viewers, I cannot even look at this girl.
You might not trust in God or obey your parents.
Isn't there a society?
If you have to live in this society then you have to follow its rules.
Only then you can live happily like everyone else.
Don't you have any intentions of living happily in this society?
I am asking you. Why are you being so staunch? Answer me.
What is happiness in life?
Are you all happy?
Can you be happy if you live by the society?
What has this society taught you?
Don't lie, do no wrong
Don't question others, trust in God
Can we be happy by following all this?
If we have to be happy in this society,
It is not enough if we follow these rules alone.
There is a much bigger responsibility.A family, two kids, a content family.
A salaried job.
Three meals a day
Own house, a normal TV
An LCD after that Oran LED after that
Or a home theater after that
A Car, a bigger car if we already have one..
After that a luxury car
Schooling for kids
A private English medium school,definitely not government school
DAV or Don Bosco, no
Even you said, "I'll put my kids only in Billabong (An international School)"
For a happy family, once in a week you must take them to the beach or restaurant or a shopping mall or a movie in a good theater.
The ticket costs 120.
All crap movies these days.
A family spends Rs.1000 on a movie and there is nothing in that movie!
But it is our fate to watch that movie.
Apart from this, clothes and shoes whenever required.
You can buy how much ever you want.We are bound to buy them.
You don't have to think what you have to buy.
Wherever you are, you are surrounded by TV, radio, newspaper, internet, mobile
roads, surrounded by shops, advertisements with "exciting offers that blow your away!"
All this is for money!
The society says that I will respect you only if you are rich. Simple.
Work wherever you want, snatch from anyone’s plate, flatter anyone, be a slave...
.. be corrupt..
..kill or coerce or rape any one...
..fool as many people as you wish...
..run a multi crore scam..
no one will penalize you..
Because, there is only one rule in this society..
The society will respect you only if you make money.
Simple!
If you don't own a house, you have problems with your wife.
Your relatives won't respect you.Nor will your parents and siblings.
You will not get a groomer bride for your child.
Where will I earn? For whom should I earn?
18 sets of clothes, an own house, a 4lakh worth car, a crap movie for Rs.120...
...these are not my wants.Whose needs are these?
It is for some rich bosses in the world and his slave bosses that govern us.
For all the rich pigs to prosper, they need a big market and India is that market.
We have no choice but to buy their products with so many ads around.
We toil everyday and buy unnecessary stuffs
We forget why we buy them for and we keep toiling.
Only then will all the rich people be happy in this world.
God has created us to keep them happy.
To die fulfilling the wants and needs of the societal standards makes a family.
Only then the society will accept your family and you.
If you accept all this only then you can be happy in this society.
To live a life like this you all can die of AIDS.
Dear Viewers, the topic is getting heated up here.
You are watching 'Yours truly' sponsored by Saahitya Wet grinders,
Run through
Run through!
Run through. Let's go ahead madam.
Shut up. I am talking and you start to leave.
I have answered your question.Ask them to apologize to me.
Sir. Get this girl out of my sight.
Peter
Make her sit down.
Please sit down.
Madam sit down please.
Why are you talking to me Peter?
Follow that girl
A camera on madam.
They are moving away.
Jayashree. Make her sit down.
Hey! Get out now.
Go for a close up.
- Sir please stay sir.- I am leaving
Sir. What is happening?
Get out I say!
Get out I say!
Look here dear
Daddy is here
Aruvi darling
What are you doing here dear?
Its my grandpa's. Real gun
There is no place for such atrocities in this house.
Aruvi is also like a daughter to me.
Don't worry
How is it? I'll kill you!
I'll heal your stress
There is no illicit relationship
Someone like this
Prostrate at my feet.
Are you free this Saturday ?
Share with me as you would share with your sister
I have AIDS
Why do you make me do shows with AIDS patients?
Look at your face.
Why do you bring such people and take my life out?
Get out, I say!
I am speaking here and you scream!
How dare you disrespect me? How dare you scream? Scream now.
I dare you to scream now.Ask them to apologise now.
Yuck! I can't see a damn thing on the frame. Move aside all of you.
What are you staring at ?
Peter.. Move them aside from the camera.
Idiots! Standing like an idol in front of the camera lens
Useless fellows!
Don't you all understand?
Emily, bring Subash, driver and the security inside.
Lock the door when you come.
I want all your mobiles and ID cards here.
Right now!
Are you all dumb?
Do you all want to get killed?
Tie it
Here, you have it.
Subash. Just a moment.
Hand it over to them.
You three are HIV negative.
The director and Peter hid this from you to make this episode interesting.
You don't care about anyone’s life.
All you care about is the episode.
Why do you get grumpy?
I know the difficulties of this disease
An HIV positive person never intends to spread it
For what you did to me, I wanted you all to apologize in front of everyone on this show.
It got completely messed up.
When my HIV condition was revealed,all of you saw me with disgust.
That irritated me.
AIDS is not a dreadful disease as you all think.
It's a chronic disease like blood pressure, heart problem and diabetes
This disease is a large business by itself.
To keep a huge amount of cash flowing, it is not the disease that is to be killed, but the patient.
Only then one can earn from it.
I do not have any intentions of hurting or killing you.
Your mobiles are here.
You can take them and leave.
You bloody wretch!
Stop there.
You think we are dumb?
You come and say you have or don't have AIDS
Some one here is dying from your gunshot.
You walk away with a simple sorry (abuses)
You are so timid and you threaten us with a gun?
- Give it!- Let go of her!
- Give it- Stop it you scoundrel !
Why are you doing this?
You loafing tranny!
Take that!
Who are you messing with?Die!
Where do you think you are?Die!
Shall I shoot?
Do you want to die?
Did I shoot him beholding a grudge?
I said I was sorry.
You thrashed Emily mercilessly.
This won't work
This won't work
Get up
Get up
I could shoot you and leave
I have no fear
I don't have anything to lose.
I don't care what you talk about.
Make me cry
or die.
Aruvi let's go.
Ss..sorry..
Say something.
You heard Madam right?
Say something
Don't shoot
You have 5 minutes.
Make me cry, or die.
(murmur) She said she'll let us go
This grown up idiot pulled her again into this.
Say something
I can't think of anything, madam.
I have a family.
I'll try, please don't shoot
I'll speak.
Rajini gets kicked out of the house, in the movie "Muthu"...
When I think of that scene...
What's that noise?
Please check what that noise was.
Subhash? Security?
Hello?
Police Station?
Sit down
When you sit on that sofa, you must speak only the truth.
You must not lie
Okay?
When did you last cry?
About 2 months back
Tell me why you cried.I'll spare you.
One day
One day
My cousin Maari called...
Don't cry while you speak
Okay
One day, my cousin Maari called
from my home town and said
The granny who sold Paniyaram (Indian delicacy) was in a serious health condition.
The doctor said she’d die that night.
He wanted me to meet her if I was going there.
Who is that lady?
In my home town she's someone who sells Paniyarams.
I've known her since childhood
Her name?
We never asked her and she never told us
Everyone knows her as the old lady selling Paniyaarams
She has a pleasant smiling face.
She had big eyes and she always keeps talking about something.
When I was in elementary school
I'd spend most of my time with her.
Buying something and eat always.
One old lady, fed the entire village.
During the harvest season
Kalathu dosa
Kalathu dosa?
Kalathu dosa
Two dosas with jaggery sandwiched between them.
It's very tasty.
I used to relish eating it
She accepts our money without even counting it
Okay, then what happened?
That night I thought about it and slept
Just as I feared
Maari called me in the morning
and told me that she passed away.
He said we could complete the funeral rights if I came
I went to the village
We took care of the funeral expenses
The funeral procession till the grave was a grand affair.
Generally, in our caste
We bury the dead
But that day
They were preparing to burn her
I asked them why
The kitchen flames have been her life all along
So, the old lady wanted to be fed to the flames in the end.
I felt very heavy upon hearing that.
The entire village gathered
We set up the pyre
and burnt her.
With wood above and below her...
...the old lady was like the Jaggery of the Kalathu Dosa.
The sight of it had me filled with tears.
It burns
That was when I cried last.
Blazing fire
Until ashes are what remain
Oh Sinner, thy sins
They emerge
A tear drop amidst nowhere
That changes
My soul
- That bar shop guy is inside?- Yes sir
Leave now. Everyone!
- What is the name of the office boy?- Subash
This is Ravichandran
Do we have signal? Can you hear me?
Whom do you want?
We are from the telecom department.We need to check the cable point.
OK come
- Who is it ?- Some cable problem nearby
The curtain is open but nothing is visible.
No one should know that the police are watching over them
Okay sir
Subhash, Bring that beer bottle
Spin it
Properly
I cannot let you go that easily
A game.
You can leave from here only if you play well.
When the bottle stops and points at you,
you will do as I say.
No matter how crazy it is, you will do as I say.
For the first mistake, I'll shoot at the wall.
For the second one,your head gets shot.
Don't hide yourself behind the others.
Come this way.
The seventh tables,without any errors.
If you make one mistake
I'll shoot around you
If you make a second mistake,I'll shoot you in the head
The seventh tables?
Yes
The seventh tables
You have 1 minute time.
OK Madam.
Seven 1s are 7
Seven 2s are 14
Seven 3s are 21
Seven 4s are 28
Seven 5s are 35
Seven 6s are 42
Seven 7s are 49

Stand back.
Subhash spin it
Don't know who is next
If it is the security, he's dead
Security

Come here
The bottle you drank from has become your enemy
I'll name a film
You have a minute
You will act out the film, understood?

Sahasam

The first one was better

Jayashree

Turn this side and do it
What? Do something.
Car
Car race

Not thalaiva
Pokkiri? Villu? Thirupachi?Thirumala?
Gilli? Puli? Kaavalan? Kaththi?Kuruvi? Youth?
I'll say something
I've named most of his movies
How is the movie?
Vijay's movie and a good movie, how do I find out?
Thuppakki (The Gun) (movie)
Act properly
What?
Sex?
Quick, time is running out.
Fan?
Wings, helicopter?
Vijay, helicopter, saving people Are you sure it is a Vijay movie? Not Arjun or Vijaykanth?
I don't know, sorry
I'm not able to figure it out
You said it isn't Thupakki (The Gun)
Yuck ! What are you doing?
Nanban (movie)?
Madam, Can I use the wash room?
Madam
I have work
I said I had to leave by 3
Bring tea for everyone,you can leave
Me?
Yes
I thought you'd die
Alas! You escaped
Madam, Shall I spin it?
Peter
You love me crazily
Propose me.
This is the flower
Hi Aruvi
I'm Peter
I have to tell you something
You're very beautiful
Someone as beautiful as you
No one could have seen
The IG couldn't be reached.
Peter is this how you propose?
Do as I say
Assume that I'm the producer
You have 3 minutes
Narrate a good emotional story
Understood?
Say it
In a village, the village head is an old guy
Respected all over
The whole town celebrates him
There's a murder in that town
- The people suspect him and he's heartbroken- He is dead for sure!
If he goes home, everyone seems suspicious and despise him
Like the movie Muthu he gives away his wealth
He goes to the forest to live alone
- Nonsense story- When he's old and waiting to die
He thinks about how happy he was with his people
and regrets dying alone
He writes a letter to everyone pouring his heart out.
He takes a photocopy and sends it.
A nice guy in the town gets the letter
Slowly
The music gets loud
He reads it
He takes his bike
Goes to a tea shop
Gets a cigarette and smokes
How happy the village head was
What all he'd done for the village
His good deeds seem to flash through his mind
He stubs the cigarette
He calls everyone
He rents a bus, takes everyone and tells them where the village head lives
The village head is happy to see them and sheds tears
Everyone makes him feel happy and he’s blown away by their love
He's smiling
The frame freezes
And we inscribe, A FILM BY PETER.
Peter, what kind of a story is this?
You said you wanted a story for a good movie
This story is bullshit!
You narrate an old fashioned story now?With a village head and all
It was my mistake to ask you for a story.
Don't you write stories that are realistic?
Why can't this happen?
Please go back to your place.
Thanks
Give everyone
Go give it
How come she's serving tea?
- Take it.- I don't want.
Can I leave?
Sit down.
Sit down, you can leave.
Sir
Come here
Come, sit down.
Sit near madam.
Hey security, Hit the girl with your stick
- We all can escape- Shut up, We'll get caught
Security
Come here.
Caught! Go.
Go
Give me the stick Why do you need it
Quick
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Scared?
Come.
Madam, I'm 62 years old
I can't even walk properly
- What harm would I be?- Sit down
Madam is your wife. She has been in an illicit relationship with this man for the past 3 years.

She's Nagalakshmi
I got fooled by her complexion.
This is good for nothing.
This was working at a photocopy shop
That's where these dogs met
3 months back I saw the texts in her mobile while giving it for service.
Do you know what messages they’ve exchanged?
What is this?
- A good husband- No one has the rights to talk about me.
Don't get angry
Explain yourself when asked to
Tell me
What else? Get us a divorce
She'll realize only when she begs on the streets.
Why did you foil their marriage?
We are colleagues and whenever crossed our limits.
What do you mean by not crossing the limits?
Keep calm. I'm asking you Nagalakshmi
Did you not cross limits?
Good Lord!
I don't know anything
Don't lie
We know, you aborted the baby last month
Abortion?
I had no idea
Open your mouth and tell her
Don't hit her
No matter what you can’t hit a woman
Sir
Why are you blinking?
I swear to God
I am in no way related to the abortion
What is he saying?
Is it not because of him?
How many men are there?
I mistook you to be homely.You seem to wander a lot!
Stop it
We guys are talking our lungs out
she isn't even entering the fray.
Listen to me, divorce us
We can't jump into decisions
Nagalakshmi what are you willing to say, tell us
- It is all my fault.- Touch up
Pappathi
- Madam- Give me the cloth.
Ready, roll
Rolling sir.
You have a good husband
Accept your mistakes
and ask your husband for forgiveness.
Sir.
Do you have a problem with her being with her husband?
It is a little saddening.
Let her do as she pleases
7 crore people are watching
He won't intrude in your life any more
Today shall be a new beginning
Apologize
You asked her to apologize
She isn't listening
I don't want this,he'll thrash me to death
- Let me go with him- That's it, it's done
Take her
I've been noticing you keep hitting her
Look how she aches for me
When she has decided to come with me
Hereafter we will stand for each other
There's nothing for me without her
Tell her to let go of everything and ask her to come with me
Let her go for shoots or anything
I'll take care of her food,juice and including touch up.
Come Shoba come sit on this sofa
Aruvi

Subash, Do you have the number of the bar guy?
Hello
I'm calling from studio
Inspector.. Inspector..
A call from inside the building..
Hello. Who is inside?
Will you open the door or should I get the force to do it?

The IG is on the phone after meeting the CM

Home Minister's PA
I just spoke to the higher authorities
The problem concerned with this issue is
The Central Government is not willing to call for NSG (National Security Guard)
They are suspecting20 people inside sir
If we are unable to tackle and there is any casualty
The problem would become bigger
The minister has spoken to the commissioner Shakeel Wahaab I.P.S
He was serving in the NSG for 6 years
In 1999
In the BGT Campus, there was a terrorist hostage crisis.
He was part of the core team

I don't know which terrorist group she is in.
Not much information.
Just give me 5 more minutes.Hurry up, quick.
Madam, Nirbhaya.

Sir, DG NirbhayaMenon is on the line
Yes mam.
I just arrived
I'll let you know. Thank you.
Call to that number.

We need to know that the20 hostages are safe
Too many gunshots, we need to know how many are dead or alive
Everyone is safe sir
How do I believe you?
Okay
Who are you, which organization,what are your demands?
I can notify the government based on what you tell me.
Let me know if you have any demands.Do you have any?

We are running out of time. We have to get in and get those idiots out.
Clear this right now.
What are you all doing?
Didn't you all see how furious the commissioner was?
Clear the funeral first.
Why are the media here?
Tell me, what is your say in this?
We have sent a warning through the Center’s intelligence
Tamil Nadu is under terrorist attacks
What he says surprises me
The State Government is responsible
Who do we blame?
- Don't talk without understanding.- We blame you..
If the hostages are safe(radio)
You ask if Tamil cinema actors can go save them?
Your plea has been heard, you will now hear DSP's music from Ajith's Veeram
What kind of a society do we live in?
Everything has resulted in terrorism..
My name is Aruvi
I don't belong to any group
I don't have any motivation
No hostages are harmed
I have only one demand
I'll tell you my demand in a while
Fulfill it
I'll surrender in the next half an hour
Can you hear me?
I've sent you her photo,find out who she is. Quick.
We don't know her demands

I asked you to stay away.
Sir, the photo..
Post people out there.
Clear them out!
I'm scared Aruvi
Hey
Hey
Surrender yourself
If the force gets in they’ll fire you.
Call them again and tell them you’ll surrender
What can the police do?
They would probably imprison me

I can only be kept under medical care

Hello, who and where are you from?
This is Sabapathi from Myladuthurai
Tell us Sabapathi, what are your views on the incident?
The laws and punishments should be severe

Subhash must be here in a while,everyone can eat and leave.

Everything is here
Who asked for foreign brand
I could only get local brand, is that okay?
Oh flag of peace that touches the sky
The high flying kite, is that of love
With lamps in our hands
We search for light
In the horse ride called life
The horse loses it's way
Who is that who predicts the future
Come relish the beauty called life while death awaits you
I'm 2 streets away from the scene
The green building where the crow is, is where the terrorists are holding hostages
We have information that Special Action Commandos from the CRPF are here
It's been about 6 hours since the terrorist attack at the local TV station, we're 50 metres from the site.
Nevertheless let us be alert
We don't know how powerful they are or what their plan is.
Tear drops in them flowery eyes
Fuels the soul drenched in emotions
The search never ends
Nor the song
There are the colours of fun
and then those of abyss
Witness God through life
For the clutches of death are inevitable
We're nearing the target
Fitting the door blaster sir
Sir, waiting for your command
Go.
Arrange the vehicle
Sir, moving in to rescue the hostages
Don't! Stop it!
The media is here, don't do anything.It will be a huge issue.
Take her away.

The interrogation has not started,we are taking them to the hospital
Both criminals are AIDS patients
One is in a serious condition and can be placed only under medical attention
Only after we produce them in court we can say any further. Thank you.
T4 cells are dropping out drastically
There must be proper intake and care
There's nothing in her system
Culminating condition, let's see
Emily?
She is stubborn and highly nutritious.
She will live many years
That wretch went somewhere
and brought back the disease.
Aruvi is not guilty of anything.
The twilight is all that remains
But the heart longs for the sunrise
Will the eye of dreams close without witnessing it
Or be gone, it's purpose unfulfilled
As a loving heart embraces you
the sorrow of your mind thaws in fear
How long do I have doctor?
You're fine, don't worry about anything and be brave. Understood?
Your name?
Aruvi
Since the offenders are AIDS patients
the Court has ordered that they be under medical care.
Just give this to her
And if she needs anything,don't hesitate to call me.
Sure.
unable to enjoy the chill breeze
Do I look ugly?
No, you look fabulous.What's with you?
your breath is always aching and longing for something
whatever relationship we had
does it look shrouded by smog?
This is life
even pain is an experience
if you ask for more
you will even be blessed with boons
the body that experiences love, lives longer
It burns
It's burning real bad
Jessy right?
Come
Should I wake her up?
Let her sleep.
the body that experiences love, lives longer
I don't like being here Emily
I guess I'll end up dead here
It stinks here
Take me somewhere
I'm afraid I'll die feeling trapped
Take me somewhere please
Nothing will happen to you Aruvi
The doctors are here
Where do we go?
I'm there for you.
Nothing will happen.
Stop worrying, close your eyes and rest.
Appa
I want to see my dad
Aruvi
Daddy is here
I'll take you dear
Daddy is always there for you
I don't like it here
Aruvi is missing
There, that's the building.
Look at dad, okay?
We've taken all the tests
Aruvi is HIV positive
Hey
Always iPad, keep it in.
- Shut up your highness- Don't talk to me like that
-You know what guys? I won't go to that shoot any more.- Really?
- Dad?- No mom, FB.
A new video message received
Someone A R U V I
Aruvi..
Mom
Emily, come here for a minute.
We're shooting a new scene
We removed her because of complaints.
Wait, I'll call you back.
I wanted to talk, that's why
I don't know if I'll be alive when you watch this
I don't know what to say
I was a brat as a kid
I used to make my brother cry
Hit him
That
The puppy I left in my home town
Parameshwari who was crying with her stained wet skirt
My school friends
I don't know what they’re doing now
I wanted to get married and have a kid
How I should bring my kid up
I longed for it
That child's face
I can't think of anything else
I'm scared
I've been here so long
that the thought of dying and leaving here
I fear that I haven’t lived the right way
It doesn't matter if there's pain
It doesn't matter if there’s suffering
It doesn't even matter if I can't swallow food
I wish I could live a few more days
Appa
I miss you a lot
My thoughts are filled with you
I didn't do anything wrong
How do you live without me?
When you asked me to get out
I had no one but Emily
She is never idle
She never listens either
I don't know why
but she loves me a lot
Always
She asks me what I want
If I want this or that
She would insist that I ask
But, I've never asked her what she wants
After my demise
If any of you name your kids Aruvi I'd be happy
That Aruvi
Tell her not trust anyone or anything blindly
Tell her to reason everything
And tell her to be kind to all, it would make me happy
I don't know what to say
I had a lot in my mind but I keep forgetting
This morning I had really bad cough
I was scared I'd die
That's when
Before I got into another coughing fit
I wanted to tell you all this.
I wish I could see you all once more
That's all
If I ever made a mistake
Forgive me
Bye.
One cigarette
- Okay sir.- It's just Peter.
Okay Peter
Peter, you love me
Propose to me.
Narrate a good emotional story
He goes to a tea shop, lits a cigarette and smokes
How happy the village head was
All his good deeds seemed to flash through his mind
He stubs the cigarette.
And the music gets louder.
Is this Aruvi's dad?
Yes..
Yea. I saw it.
Yes, let's go.
What time?
I'll be there in the morning.
- Where is Andalkudigal?- It's right up here.
Appa
Darling
Darling!
Subhash
Shall we spin the bottle?
