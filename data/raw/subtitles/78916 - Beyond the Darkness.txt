BEYOND THE DARKNESS
- If you're through, come by
and pick up the next one.
- All right. - Bye. See you later.
Anna!
What is it?
- I'm choking...
- Nurse!
Nurse!
Hurry, doctor.
Please!
Here.
Frank...
Frank...
Feeling better?
Could I, please, have some makeup?
There. That's much nicer.
There was a telephone call
for you from the hospital.
What?
Why the hell didn't you tell me right away?
Stupid idiot.
Sorry.
Where did you get your licence?
Hello.
Hi, darling.
Frank, I love you.
Just once, before I die, my darling...
... I want to make love with you.
You mustn't speak like that.
I'm telling you...
... death is no power to separate us.
Why did you come back into this room?
You promised me that you never would again.
I want you to go.
I want to stay here alone with my mother.
Frank, your mother is dead, remember?
Iris... this morning Anna died.
So there's no one left 
to take care of you now.
Only me, your little Iris.
I'll always help you, dear.
For the rest of my life.
My little Frank.
No one knows you the way Iris does.
Oh, yes...
Little Frank will be 
so very happy with his Iris.
I promise.
Here I am.
Here I am, my little baby boy.
The Lord is my shepherd.
Therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in the green pastures...
... and lead me forth
 the side the waters of comfort.
He shall convert my soul...
... and bring me forth in the path
 of righteousness...
... for his name's sake.
Though I walk through 
the valley of the shadow of death...
... I will fear no evil...
... for thou art with me.
Your rod and thy stack comfort me.
Your loving kindness and mercy...
... shall follow me all the days of my life.
And I will dwell in the House of Lord
 for ever.
Hear us, oh Lord on high.
Omnipotent and internal God.
We humbly deceit your grace
 for our sister, Anna.
Who lived her life free of sin, and who
died surrounded by your men's love.
Accept her pure soul, oh Lord and give it
eternal rest in your kingdom...
... which is Paradise.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen-
My wife and I will be
leaving in a matter of hours.
We can't stay here anymore.
- Of course.
- Everything here reminds us of her.
If you ever need to get in touch with us,
talk to my daughter, Elena.
She'll be staying on through
till the end of her school term.
Here. This is the address of her school.
- You can always call me, too.
- Certainly.
By the way... I want my daughter's grave
looked after constantly.
And please have the stone we ordered put up.
This is the cheque.
Would you take care of paying it?
I simply can't face these details.
- I understand.
- Thank you for everything 
you've done and will do.
Hey, stop!
Need a hand, young fella?
No, thanks, sir.
I'm almost finished.
- Ok, good night,
- Good night, sir.
Hey.
You afraid?
You really look uptight.
Sorry to climb in like that but 
I was getting tired
out in the field all night.
My name is Jan. From London.
Wanna tell me your name?
- What do you want?
- Ain't it obvious?
A lift!
Oh, come on, please.
I've got some good shit
that'll turn you on too.
I'm glad you've come along when you did.
I'd have been there all night.
Hey, go slow!
This stuff's worth is weight in gold!
I tell you, this will set you in orbit.
I left England last March.
I've been hitch-hiking for three months now.
I always say this is the best way for a
person to get on in a foreign country.
You want a hit?
No.
You don't know what you're missing.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Could I talk to Frank for a second?
Just a moment, please.
I'll go and call him.
Thanks.
Hi, Frank.
- What is it?
- Listen, I've got a client 
who's interested in that baboon.
 The one I gave
you the other day. Is it ready?
No.
I haven't got time.
Damn it to hell! The guy'll pay a fortune!
He doesn't give a damn where
it's from, he's a collector!
It's just a hobby of me, you know that.
Besides, you know I don't
like working for other people.
- I don't like it at all.
- I know, I know but you can bend
 the rules once in a while.
It's a personal favour.
Ok, ok. I'll bring it to you 
as soon as it's ready, all right?
Yeah, great. Thanks a lot, Frank. See ya.
So long.
- Here you go.
- Thanks. But what's it all about?
That's none of your business.
Where is she?
- Who?
- Where did you hide her?
She's in a much safer place
 than where she was.
Sometimes I could kill you, Iris!
Don't raise your voice to me.
You'd be nothing on your own.
Come on.
What's the matter, Frankie baby?
Did it get into you?
Leave me alone!
Don't worry, darling.
Iris is here.
Feels better now, doesn't it?
Yes, my little Frank is
better now, I can tell.
Much better.
Good clever Iris knows how
 to take care of him, doesn't she?
Doesn't she?
Here I am, Mr. Kale.
Well?
It's all complete, sir.
Just a minute...
Frank Wyler, age 22,
son of Virgil and Emma.
Her maiden name was Stroub.
Parents died nine years ago
 in a car accident.
On his 18th birthday 
he became owner of the villa...
... a good deal of farm land,
and a rather large amount of money.
I wasn't able to find out the exact sum.
But I was given to believe that
it quite substantial indeed...
...comprising cash, stocks
and many investments.
That's it, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Is it bad.
I tell you it hurts like hell.
I come running here quite a lot.
But I don't think I've ever seen you 
before today.
Well, because I've never been here
 before today.
Why did this have to happen, dammit.
I have a race in two days, an important one.
Well I could go get something 
for you from the drugstore,
a ligament, a lotion...
- I'll try to make it. Give me a hand.
- Sure.
You'll never make it back to the town.
Look, my house is right down the road.
Come over there.
I'll fix you up with emergency bandage,
then I'll take you back with the car.
- What do you say?
- I haven't got much choice, right?
Boy, does it hurt.
You're really pretty good, you know.
I bet you're a doctor.
No, I'm not.
I'd better go get the gauze.
I'll be right back.
Hey, what happened to you?
You got lost?
Sorry.
I had hell of a time finding it.
This is really nice from you.
Come on, finish this first.
- Shall we go in the other room?
- Sure.
Get out of here.
Go away!
Go away!
Frank... it's dangerous to keep
that other one in the house.
What other one?
I mean Anna.
- This would be the right time...
- No!
Not Anna.
- She's going to stay with me forever.
- Forget about her. She's dead.
You must realize that!
And we're alive.
I'll do everything you ask me to.
I'll marry you.
You can be the mistress of the house 
for real.
But not Anna...
She stays with me.
Forever.
Understand that, please, Iris.
All right, little boy.
No one will touch your baby doll.
Good morning.
Good morning.
How are you doing?
We'd like to speak
 with the owner of this villa.
You are.
What is it?
A young girl was reported missing
 three days ago.
She went out to do some jogging, 
but she never came back.
Last time she was seen was near here.
Did you see her too by any chance?
No.
But I don't get out of the house 
everyday either. Who are you?
Police.
We have no search warrant, but we'd have
no difficulty getting one.
However we would like to take 
a look around if it's all right.
What's going on?
Nothing. They're looking for a girl.
Seems one disappeared here three days ago.
I think that's what they say.
May I ask who you are?
One of the family.
I hope you have no objection,
if we take a quick look around.
- No objection at all. This way.
- Thank you.
Would you like to start with the top floor,
the ground floor or the basement?
The basement, I think.
You've got quite a talent there, young man!
Really seems it's about to take off!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Do you like that squirrel?
- It's marvellous.
- Then consider it yours.
- Oh, really, I didn't mean to...
A small gift to our brave police force.
- You can't be discourt in that case.
- Thank you.
That's all right.
Here, let me wrap it up for you.
Now if you'd like to look 
at the upper floors...
I don't think that'll be necessary.
We've seen all we needed to.
Fine, whatever you'd like.
We'll go out this way.
- Now maybe you'll think
I'm old-fashioned...
- I know you are!
- All right, I am and I suppose...
But I believe in marriage and I'm glad Iris
has finally hooked someone!
- And someone young and good-looking!
- And rich, don't forget that!
Just like my little sister.
You're all simply disgraceful.
To me it's a marriage of love, 
made in Heaven!
- Love conquers all,
 isn't that right, darling?
- Yeah, of course, my dear.
It's also blind, thank goodness!
Something tells me the star of
the evening is about to appear!
I hope you'll enjoy it.
I always say no one could cook 
a chicken like my little niece!
I hate to tell you uncle Burt, 
but it's a stuffed pig.
- Would someone cut it please?
- I wonder who that someone could be!
Oh, there's no need to be subtle...
...that means me, I know
my queue when I hear it!
- Where's the young man by the way?
- He'll be here soon.
- Is he a snob, or just shy?
- Neither, of course.
He just had some work he had to finish.
He'll be right here.
- Well, we can't start eating without him.
- No, it's just not right.
Manners are fine, but I'm starving!
Hell, well I'm through waiting!
Well, he is the master
of the house, after all.
Iris, dear, I do think
you should go call him.
- And hurry!
- Here he is now!
My dears...
Now I can finally make the announcement.
We've set the date. It's May the 1st.
Would you all join me in drinking to it?
My, what's wrong with the lad?
- He doesn't look well.
- Just nervous.
- Like all bridegrooms.
- Excuse me.
Frank
Anna...
Anna, my love.
My darling.
You're forever mine.
Darling... nobody ever can separate us.
I'll always be here.
Frank... is that you?
Get out.
Leave me alone.
You simply can't go any further with this.
Get rid of it!
Get rid of your stupid little doll!
No!!
You will, yes.
You've got to do it.
That's it! That's enough!
Get out of here, you old slut.
You shouldn't have done that, Frank.
You're going to be sorry.
Get out of here.
Get out!
Anna...
I'll always stay with you.
You are the only reason I have to live.
Yes...
Hi.
- How about a dance?
- I don't feel like that very much.
Too damn hot. Like a furnace in there.
Why don't we take it out and go for a spin?
Ok.
Why not?
Body of a whore dead forevermore...
Body three times cursed, 
pain and torture first...
Body in a bed, body growing dead...
Body in a crypt, body hellfire dit...
Body waning down, body into hell...
Always be a taker, 
hurry and meet your maker...
No one's life you'll save,
 rot so in your grave.
What was that all about?
Who knows? Some crazy old bag.
Here we are.
- How much is it?
- 6.50.
- Shall I wait for you?
- No thanks, you can go. - All right.
Don't run away.
I'm just drying off, I'll be right there.
Good evening.
I'm Anna's sister.
My school term's over
so I'm leaving tomorrow...
...but I wanted to say goodbye
to Frank if he had a second.
I haven't seen him for a long time.
Not since my sister's funeral.
Come in.
Thank you.
- Here, get dressed, quick!
- Hey, what's with you?
You've got to go.
Hurry!
Not this girl,
 not til I get what I came for!
You've got to get out of here!
I mean it. You'd better go.
Now.
I'll take you home but you've got to hurry!
I saw her!
I saw her!
- Don't let her get away.
- Don't worry, I won't.
Hurry up, will you?
Wait for him here.
He'll be with you shortly.
Sit down, please.
Elena...
Elena...
You shouldn't have come here.
Elena...
Elena...
You shouldn't have come here!
Elena...
There's a curse on this house!
- There's a curse on this house!
- Who's there?
Who's there?
Who is it?
No!
Don't ask me why, Father,
because I don't know.
I only know that those bastards
 got in touch with me.
And they gave me back the
body of this poor girl...
...after I've paid out 
a large sum of ransom.
I still have the cheque that her parents 
left me for the stone and the flowers.
That'll be enough.
That'll do.
