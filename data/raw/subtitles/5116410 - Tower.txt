 as a typical summer day
 in Austin, Texas.
And it was a day
that you sat around, frankly.
 And we were trying
 to decide...
 Okay, what do we
 cover today?
 [spotty police dispatch]
- Main Tower...
University of Texas...

called my number

 So...I just said I was headed
toward the University of Texas.
- We had police radios,
of course,
throughout the newsroom.
 - And then, within seconds...
- There's a guy on top
of the Tower and he's shooting.
Shooting at people,
and they're dispatching officers
as best they can
to the scene.
- Police operator.
- This is Michael Hall,
there's just been a gunshot
right in front of the Tower.
 [gunshot]
- I heard what I thought
were two firecrackers.
And I thought,
"Somebody still has
firecrackers
from the Fourth of July."
 - Police operator.
 - Hi, this is the Department
 of English at the University.
 Someone has been shot,
 we believe, outside.
 Someone is shooting
 from the Tower.
- I was in Shakespeare class
when it started.
And we all ran to the windows
of the English Building.
 [gunshot]
We just stood there peering out
over each other's shoulders.
 [gunshot]
- I realized that there was
someone shooting from the Tower
and that if I could see him,
he could see me.
- There are snipers.
Somebody has shot
four different people.
 [gunshot]
 - Yes, ma'am,
 it's been reported.
 She says four people
have been shot up there so far.
- As I ran behind the car,
the shot from the rifle
 sounded like
 it was almost in my ear,
 and I could hear
 the bullet ricochet.
When I asked
if anyone had been hit,
 someone said five people,
including a little boy
on a bicycle.
 [gunshot]
 - When I got shot,
 we both fell down.
 [gunshot]
 [ears ringing]

You're gonna be okay, honey.

 wasn't alive any longer.

 a temperature approaching

 firing and shooting at any

 The pavement was so hot

 the backs of my legs.

and I just hollered out--
"Anybody got a rifle?"
Some old boy said he did.
 [gunshot]
- Do you wanna?
- Yeah.
 I took the rifle first.
 But, see,
 I've never shot a scope.
 I was raised a poor boy,

 I glanced down
 and I saw Billy get hit.
Billy!
- We have a man here, just came
from the base of the Tower.
What's your name please, sir?
- Leland Ammons.
- Better duck down
a little bit here.
You were standing beside
the policeman when he was shot?
- Yes.
- Was there just one shot fired?
 - Uh, well, he was--
 He opened fire on us
when he saw the,
uh, policeman
with a shotgun converging.
The policeman was walking,
he shot him through
the, uh, support near
the statue of Jefferson Davis.
- The shots came near you
at the time, though?
- Oh, yes.
There were shots all around.
- A couple of students
crept out the back door
and made their way to him.
 A girl had taken off her slip
and was using it to try
to stanch the bleeding,
but he was bleeding a lot.
 The guy that was with her
 had gotten a little tin cup
 and had filled it with water.
It was just like
the cowboy movies, right?
 - We, uh,
 did all we could for him.
But whether he was
still conscious when
they carried him off
in the ambulance, we don't know.
Maybe it could be
a superficial wound.
 [gunshot]
- Billy!
- I saw him get hit here.
So I-I thought he was gonna
be all right, you know?
 - That was the moment
 that separated
 the brave people
 from the scared people.
 I knew that there was no way
that I was going to go
out there and help him.
I didn't wanna get shot.
 That was a defining moment
because I realized
I was a coward.
 - I met up with Billy
not a couple hours before that.
 We just talked
 a little while.
 Just a good ol' boy
 conversation.
 - He was gonna quit.
 He said...
 He was gonna work
 a couple more months
and then he was gonna quit
and go back to college.
And that's just what
he was gonna do.
And uh, you know, his wife
just had a baby and everything.

and this is not too nice,
I took up a position

 And I gave him

 He fired once at the column
 and hit it.
But he didn't do it again.
 I waited until the individual
 started firing

 - You could see the bodies
 lying on the campus.
 On the Main Mall.
 [gunshot]
And we knew then
that there was nothing
 that could be done
 from that office.
So we were inextricably
drawn closer.
 We got up to the statue
 of Jefferson Davis.
 People say that that statue
 should be taken down,
 that that statue
 has no place being there
because of Jefferson Davis
and all he represents.
 But at least on that day,
 it gave me a little shelter.
 Across from the Main Mall,
 there was about
 a dozen students
 there as well,
 all looking
 at the bodies laying there.
 And it was frustrating,
 I guess.
 Something has to be done,
 but if I go out there?
 [gunshot]
I might die.
 [camera clicking]
- It was like
a frozen snapshot.
 [camera clicks]
 Obviously some people
 were still alive
 and hiding behind
 small things.
 A couple people
 seemed really...dead.
I've never seen a dead body.
 I didn't care
 if they bombed the Tower.
I just wanted a plane to come
and take that guy out.
- What else did you see as you
 came through the campus?
Did you see any other
injured persons?
- There's several people laying
out on the Mall at this time.
Three of them may be shot,
 and the others may just
 be laying there.
 [gunshot]
 - A woman was lying
 on her back on the Mall,
and she was
obviously pregnant
 and in obvious pain.
It was hard to watch her
 and to know that no one
 could get to her
 without being shot
 themselves.
 - Under the base
 of the Tower,
 there were a lot
 of people there.
 And they were yelling.
 They were saying,
 "We've gotta help
 that pregnant woman!"
 And then somebody else
 yelled out,
"No, we've gotta help the ones
that there is still hope for."
So I thought...
Well...
I probably wasn't
gonna get help.
- Has any effort been made
to try to get those persons out?
 [gunshots]
Another shot. He's still firing
 repeatedly from
 the University Tower.
 - I was trying to figure out
 what was happening.
I didn't feel pain.
It felt more like
something really heavy
was pressing down on me.
I thought it felt like
an invasion from outer space
 because I felt like
 I'd been shot
 by some kind
 of antimatter gun.
 It felt like that's
 what was happening.

- All right.
 - As it went on, I moved
 forward a little bit more.
 Kind of inching around,
 getting a little bit
 different viewpoint,
 that sorta thing,
 as we kept broadcasting.
 [gunshots]
 I think it's
 kind of a natural instinct.
 "Hey, I gotta get closer.
 I gotta see what's going on."
We are not sure that the police
 are returning the fire,
 but we do hear the shots
 and we do...
 But I wasn't, believe me...
 [gunshot]
I wasn't trying to put myself
in harm's way.
Under the clock

of Texas Tower,

 - I saw this airplane.
 circling the tower.
 It was a single-engine
 small airplane.
But the drafts
of the heat and the wind,
the airplane just couldn't get
a steady shot of the sniper.
 The Austin Police Department,
they didn't have weapons
that would reach
from the ground
to the top of the Tower.
 [gunshot]
 - It was like a war.
There were gunshots
coming from everywhere.
 - At one point,
 I saw a civilian
 carrying a deer rifle
 coming from behind me
 and running toward the Tower.
- I don't know where
these vigilantes came from,
 but Parlin Hall was filled
 with civilians with huge guns
 and they began to shoot back.
There was massive testosterone.
 - This was an average citizen
who heard my report
on the radio
and decided to come help.
We didn't know it at the time,
 but what was happening
 was my radio broadcast...
 The feeds were made
 to the radio networks
 and to all the other news
 outlets around the country.
 - At approximately 12:15,

 for phone reports
 to radio stations all over

 Reports were recorded

 Halifax, Nova Scotia,
 San Diego, California,

 or more than one sniper

 One boy was shot while

 Two others have been

 Guadalupe Street.
 There are people hiding

 observation deck...
 Below the--Below the clock,
 and is shooting.
 He's shooting our direction.
 We just saw a puff of smoke,
 he's firing again.
 It's a battle now.
 It's a battle between
 the sniper and the police.
 - I could hear
 all the shooting.
 [gunshots]
 [sirens wailing]
 Hear the sirens.
 I knew it was a disaster,
 so to speak,
 because the only ones
 with sirens were ambulances.
 [gunshot]
 - I saw Officer Martinez
 there at 21st Street.
Martinez!
Hey, Officer!
 And I hollered out to him,
 but he didn't hear me.
 [gunshot]
 - I tried to keep myself
 from being able
 to see the top of the Tower
 because I knew if I could see
 the top of the Tower,
 the sniper could see me.
 I ran until I got
 to the South Mall
 by the Jefferson Davis
 statue.
 [gunshot]
 [gunshot]
 There were wounded people...
 and dead people,
 people whose conditions
 I did not know,
 lying there on the sidewalk.
 [gunshot]
 [gunshots]
 There was a pregnant woman

 in the hot sun.
 My training in the army
 had taught me

right away.
 Then your organize

 I thought maybe I could
 go into the Tower
 and assist the people

 Just breathe.
Stay with me, Claire.
 Hey.
Can you hear me?
Stay with me, Claire.
Claire?
- Yeah?

- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's a good girl.

You're okay.

 I got a busy signal
because everything
was jammed.
 I just needed
 to get upstairs
 and find out
 what the game plan was.
 [elevator moving]
Oh, my God. I'm heartily sorry
for having offended thee.
I detest all my sins because
of thy just punishment,
most of all because
they offend thee.
My God, you are all good

I firmly resolve
with the help of thy grace
to sin no more and to avoid
the near occasions of sin.

- What's going on, Jerry?
- Hell, I don't know.
- It's good you're here.
 - 90s, I need a unit

 at the Security Building.
- Yeah, this is McCoy.
Go ahead.
 - We need a unit to go
 to the UT Security Building
 and they'll go with him
 to the 27th floor.
- Uh, okay, you said
the campus security booth?
- I'm meeting other officers?
 - 25 to statewide.
- 10-4, I'm headed
that way now.
 Here comes Connor,
 Shoquist, Sheppard, and Moe,
 and they had teargas guns.
And I asked Phillip. I said,
"Did you bring any shotguns?"
And he said no.
Wished he had.
- Claire? Claire?
Can you hear me still?
Look at me, Claire.
Look at me.
 - She made sure
 to keep me talking
 so I wouldn't lose
 consciousness.
- Don't worry.
We're gonna be okay.
 - But it was getting harder
 and harder for me to answer.
 - Stay with me.
 [gunshot]
Claire, just look at me.
 - But she was persistent.
 She kept asking me questions.
- It's okay, Claire.
 - It was beautiful.
 [gunshot]
 A selfless act.
- I know it hurts,
but just hold on
a little longer.
 [gunshot]
 - You know,
the sun was directly overhead.
 [gunshots]
I was dressed in all black,
like an idiot.
 And I suddenly began
 to feel dizzy.
 Nauseous.
 I was sick to my stomach,
 and I was losing
 my coordination.
 She was so, so pregnant.
 I could see her move.
 I knew she was shot and hurt.
 I crawled underneath
 the hedges into the shade,
 where it's a lot cooler
 and quieter.
 - It was endless waiting.
 Endless terror.
 [gunshot]
Disappointment
and hopelessness
that you're not able to do
anything to make it stop
or to help the people
that are suffering.
 - Every 15 minutes...
 [Tower bell rings]
 The bell would ring from
 the top of the UT Tower.
And I'd think,
"That's 15 more minutes.
"15 more minutes they were out
 there on that hot concrete."
 [gunshot]
 - I think...
I just wanted
to close my eyes.
 I tried not to move.
- Stay still.
It'll be okay, all right?
 - I tried to just
 act like I was dead
 so he wouldn't
 shoot me again.
 The concrete was so hot
 that at some point
I just decided,
"I can't take it anymore."
 [gunshot]
 - When I came out
 from under those hedges,
 I knew something
 had to be done.
 Someone had to go out there
 and get 'em.
- I just remember
looking up at the sky.
It was so blue.
And just thinking...
"I guess this is it.
- "I guess this is the end."
 - That's when I decided
 to go out there.
 And we had to move fast.
 We knew that.
 You can see
 there was a camera.
 Time moved strangely.
 Slowly.
 I grabbed Claire's feet.
 James grabbed Claire's arms.
- Tom!
[crying]
Tom!
- I've never been more scared.
- [laughing]
I've never been more scared.
And we ran 'em off.
 We ran her into safety
 to behind the hedge
 and set her down.
And other people took her
where the ambulances were.
 [gunshot]
 There's a...
There's a cold spot
that I can feel
on my back right now.
And when I think about it,
it's about the size of a grape.
It's all the w--
Halfway up my spine.
It's halfway
between my shoulder blades.
 And it's the place
 I expected
 the bullet to come in...
If I was hit.
 As I went down the stairs,
the glasses slowly--
I was sweating like a pig.
 The glasses slowly
 came off my face.
 Everything was turning
 into a complete blur for me
 without those glasses
 and I couldn't see a thing.
 I had to go back out,
 out from cover again,
 to pick up my glasses.
 Her boyfriend...
 He was--He was also
 carried off.
 - One of those who
 was out of breath now after
running out onto the mall
rescuing those who'd been shot
is Brehan Ellison of Austin,
who's been in Vietnam
and has been back
for two years.
Brehan, how many have you
gone out to rescue?
 - Today, two.
 - What did you have to do?
- Run hard and keep low.
- Did you have any trouble
getting them up
or did any shots come close
to you while you were out there?
- No shots came close to me.
Just the last one, he was dead.
He was dead weight.
He was a little hard to pick up.
Too limp, not like someone
who's knocked out.
- How many have you seen
that are dead today?
- Just one.
I hope not any more.
 [gunshots]
- I knew what I had to do.
Knowing I had to walk up those
 stairs was a lonely feeling.
- Where you going?
- Up.
- I'm going with you.
 - When we reached
 the first landing
 I could see the face
 of a young boy.
- Good Lord.
 - His eyes were open
 and he was dead.
 I quickly turned around
 the corner
 and I saw a young woman,
 a dead young woman,
 lying at his feet.
 And there was another woman
 lying there,
 and we...we turned her
 on her side
to keep her from drowning
in her own blood.
 There was a young man
 that was wounded.
 Slumped against the wall,
 still conscious.
- The boy that was at
the foot of the stairs saw us.
And Martinez and I asked him
how many people
were shooting.
[clears throat]
And he replied, "One."
 - He said, "He's outside."
 [gunshot]
 And he pointed upstairs.
 [gunshots]
- So we playing for keeps?
- Damn right we are.
- I guess you better
deputize me, then.
 - I looked at him and...
I thought he was an officer
from some other agency.
Consider yourself deputized.
All right, ready?
- I'll cover you.
 We worked our way
 into the room...
 And found a woman lying
 on her back behind the sofa.
- Gotta keep going.
 [gunshots]
The shooting outside sounded
just like rolling thunder.
 [gunshots]
You got me?
- I got you.
 Martinez went to the door
 and he had trouble
 getting the door open.
- Well, time's passing,
but...
 You don't feel like
 time's passing.
Do you understand that?
 [gunshots]
- Let's go.
You need to cover that corner.
If anyone comes around there,
you shoot 'em.
 [gunshots]

Guess I--Guess I ain't

 - I turned and saw an officer
 I knew, Houston McCoy.
All I had was my .38,
so that--that shotgun
looked pretty beautiful
at that moment.
Get down.

- The other two officers
went this way.
I'll cover you.
- Got it.
 - A picture came to my mind.
My boys and my wife.
 And immediately
 it went out of my mind.
I didn't have a fear

I really didn't.
- There was no time

Now, I'd be a fool
or I'd be a liar

I was not scared.
I was scared.
But you put that behind you.
You cannot have fear in front

that I wasn't going to allow
anybody to make me dead.

running on the walkway.
I fired one round
in an attempt to stop him.
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry!
I heard him run
the other direction.
 - It's going to take longer
to tell you
than it did to do it.
- I emptied my gun.
- There was some firing,
and then it was all over.
 [gunshots]
- By the time
I had emptied my pistol...
- By the time
I had emptied my pistol...
- McCoy fired.
- McCoy was pretty close--
I grabbed that shotgun
from McCoy and I shot him
one more time
as he was hitting the ground.
 After that was done,
my knees felt like rubber.
I felt like I had been hit
by a sledgehammer.
I mean all my energy left me.
And I was shaking. Rounds,
bullets were still coming up.
And I said I had enough
and I left.
 - The campus,
 for all practical purposes,
 has been cleared.
 Police got to the Tower,
 and are keeping
 all the persons
 in the University Tower,
 and the main police
 are coming out

 The University area
 has been cordoned off.
 - I waved my handkerchief
 to stop the firing
 from down on the ground.
 [gunshots continue]
- Once that flag waved,
I knew it was over then.
It was bam-bam-bam-bam.
It was just...
'Cause we had--
You had dozens of gunmen
firing at the Tower
from all directions.
 And they slowly stopped.
 - Ladies and gentlemen,
 we have this word

 The sniper has been seen
 waving a white flag

 According to reports

- It was like a big...
[exhales]
Sigh of relief.
The sirens all of a sudden
started getting silent.
The bullets stopped.
 And it was quiet.
 - Someone waved a flag.
And...I walked around.
 There was blood everywhere.
People just surged
out of the building.
- We all walked up the steps.
It seems like
we filled the mall.
- It was a few people at first,
and then dozens,
and then hundreds.
 - I don't remember anyone
being articulate
about what had happened.
 You know,
 just shock and awe.
Kind of a blankness.
 - They looked like
 they were mesmerized.
They-they weren't
hugging each other.
They weren't talking
to each other.
 Most of them were
 just kind of milling,
 walking around,
 as if dazed and wondering,
"What in the world
has happened to my world?"
 [camera clicking]
 - They didn't know the names
 of the people who had died.
And we didn't know
what had happened
until later that day.
 It was a sad time,
 a very sad time.
Not only for the people
who lost
or were losing
their loved ones,
but for the whole campus,
the whole town, and the state.
- It was not something
you would expect
from our beautiful Tower.
 - I just sat there
 and watched people gather.
 It was something
 that I had been a part of
 for an hour and a half.
 It was done for me.
 [sirens wailing]
 - The Travis County
 Blood Bank
 has asked

 There is an urgent need

 not to cut off my dress
because it was
the first day I'd worn it.
It was my first

 It was very beautiful.
Tom had helped me pick it out.
 - My dad was working downtown
 in a shoe-repair shop,
 and then somebody
 came up to him
 and asked him
 if he knew what was going on.
My dad said no.
And the guy said,
"Well, there's been
a lot of shooting going on."
- He said, "Yeah, there's
a lot of shooting going on.
"And, oh, by the way,
your son has been shot
and he was killed."
He went home, picked up my mom,
and the two of 'em
rushed over to the hospital.
He-he did not want
to believe that...
until it was something
that he-he could...
that could be confirmed.
Whereas my mother
was responding...
I guess like a mother.
My parents didn't find out for
several hours that I was okay.
 - It's a madhouse here
 at Brackenridge Hospital.
 At least 17 persons are here
 undergoing treatment.
We have had unconfirmed reports
 that two persons have died.
 We have a list of the names.
 These names were
 just given to us
 by the hospital
 administrator.
 The victims have been
 identified as Oscar Royuela,
 Billy Speed, Robert Boyer,
 Paul Sonntag,
 Roy Schmidt, Billy Snowden--
- Joe, hold it.
 Hold just a minute.
 This is Paul
 over at the newsroom.
 What was that list of names
 again, please?
- One of the people
who came rushing
into our newsroom
to help out was Paul Bolton.
 He had gone
 into semi-retirement
 and I had taken over
 his position
 as the television
 news director.
Paul was working there
in the newsroom
when Joe read
the list of names.
And Paul reacted dramatically
at that point.
- Roy Schmidt, Billy Snowden--
- Joe, hold it.
 Hold just a minute.
 This is Paul
 over at the newsroom.
 Everyone is interested
 in that list of names.
 I think you have
 my grandson on there.
 Go over that list

"I think you have my..."
[sniffles]
"I think you have

I think you have my grandson
on that list."
Uh...
And Joe said,
"Okay. Okay, I'll do that."
And he went through the--
The list again.
And, yeah, it was his namesake
grandson, Paul Bolton Sonntag.
Didn't know at the time
if he'd been killed,
but he was.
Frankly,
I just broke up now.
I think it's...
[laughs]
I think it's because
I have grandchildren.
 - I was in intensive care
 for seven weeks.
 Rita came to see me
 when I was in the hospital.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm...[clears throat]
I'm, uh...
I'm doing better now.
- I made you something.
It's nothing much.
I just...
 - She came and brought me
 a painting she had done.
I was just, you know,
incredibly touched
by her bringing that
 and, um...I think
 that's the only time
we saw each other after that.
Only recently I've realized...
 How really, amazingly
 brave that was of her.
- Are you all right?
Let me help you.
We've heard from all sorts
of people involved in this
how terrified they were.
 And yet she came
 right up to me.
 I mean,
 that was very selfless.
Why did you do that,
you know?
What gave you the courage
to come out and do that?
 And were you afraid?
Were you afraid that
you were going to get killed?
- For a person
to be so giving,
has to go lay down
on hot concrete
on a 100 degree day.
 - Somehow, you know,
 that situation
 just pulled out
 that hero in her.
 - There's a special place
in Heaven for people like that.
She's a wonderful woman.
 [office bustling]
 - As our various reporters
 and photographers
were bringing the film
back for processing,
we were getting their stories
and their information.
As we got a fuller picture
of where the damage was
 and looked at the film,
it was even more horrifying...
Than you could imagine.
 - KTBC Television News
 now presents
 a special program
 on today's mass murder
 in the capital city.
 Here is KTBC Television
 News Editor, Neal Spelce.
- Good evening.
One of history's
worst mass-murders occurred
here in Austin today.
By official count tonight,
49 persons were hit by gunfire.
There are 16 dead
and 33 injured.
It started last night,
when a man reportedly
killed his wife
and his mother.
That same man apparently
rounded up an arsenal
and supplies this morning
and then went
 to the observation deck of
the University of Texas Tower.
It was then that terror
rained down from the Tower.
 [gunfire]
 Charles J. Whitman
 was shot down
 on the observation deck
 by two city policemen.
The policemen were aided
by an Austin man, Allen Crum.
 The story of how they ended
 the 90 minutes of terror
was told this afternoon
at a news conference
held by Austin Police Chief
Bob Miles.
- Did you guys shoot
as soon as you saw him?
- Did anybody ask him
to surrender
or give up or anything
before all the firing started?
- No. As I said
just a moment ago,
 Mr. Crum fired one shot
 into the west wall
When Officer Martinez
looked around the corner,
Mr. Whitman had his gun
leveled out and ready to shoot.
Officer Martinez had no way
of knowing whether Officer Day
or Mr. Crum
had already come out
and were in a position
to be shot.
- At the news conference,
of course it was McCoy,
 Jerry Day,
 Allen Crum, and myself.
- If you don't mind,
I'll do the talking
for the group.
And no. No.
And if I'm wrong,
Mr. Martinez can stop me
and, uh, correct me on it.
 - The reporters
 asked questions
 and Chief Miles answered
 all the questions.
 We were just there for
 show and tell, so to speak,
because he handled it.
- The man here beside me
is Allen Crum.
He was deputized
to go up on the Tower
 with the two policemen
 who ended the gun battle.
- You got me?
- I got you.
- Mr. Crum, could you
tell us how you happened
to be in the Tower building
in the first place?
- Well I, uh...
[clears throat]
Became involved in this
when I looked out
of the Co-Op window and saw
a boy shot across the street.
I went across the street
to investigate
because I thought
it was a small fight.
And as I stepped out the door,
 I heard the sound of shots.
- And you actually
went into the Tower?
- Yes, sir. I couldn't
get back across the street
because of my fear
that I might get shot myself.
So I went to the next building,
and the next building.
I thought perhaps I could help
them when I got over there
so I waited 'till he shot
from the other side of the Tower
 and then ran into it myself.
 - Mr. Crum,
 I know that I speak
for all the citizens
of Austin in expressing
our gratitude to you
and to the Austin
police officers
who put an end
to the reign of terror
on the University
of Texas campus.
- I've never known
braver men.
 Their decisions
 were correct,
 timely done,
and accomplished in an honorable
manner.
If I had to do this
over again with these men,
 I certainly would.
 The Chief of Police
 offered me a check
from the City of Austin
for one day's
deputized citizen's pay.
 I refused it, of course.
 - Somehow, we ended up
 out on Airport Boulevard
 in a vacant lot
with a case of Lone Star beer.
 Took off our weapons,
 still dressed in our blues
and everything like that but...
 We wasn't policemen no more.
 If I would have just gone in,
 if I had just gone
 right up to that elevator,
pressed that button
to the top floor...
Gone in and get him done.
- Go up and get him done,
then Billy Speed
would still be alive.
- Billy!
- And a lot of other,
I'm sure, but...
But-but-but...
didn't happen that way.
- [sighs]
Shoulda-coulda.
[chuckles]
But I didn't.
- Shoulda, coulda. Shoulda...
Shoulda, coulda.
But didn't.
So...I don't know.
 - Well, to say it hasn't
 affected me in my life,
it wouldn't be
a truthful statement.
But I have, um...
tried.
I have tried
to just forget it.
 I hate to see people
 get hurt.
But, you know,
you have to be realistic
and know that these things
are gonna happen.
And so you have to have the way
how to cope with it,
how to take care
of the problems.
 - If somebody were
 to ask how you feel,
 well...
Well, I'd say no words.
It's something--
I've been asked that before,
How-how did it
make you feel?
And then I kinda
have to say, "Well...
"How would I describe
the colors of a rainbow
to a person born blind?"
 You can't,
 'cause there ain't no words.
Uh, I don't know.
- This is the shirt
that I was wearing.
And I must've weighed
about 90 pounds when...
When this shooting happened.
See that little tear
right there?
It's where the bullet
just kinda pew.
 [gunshot]
This is my cousin,
Lee Zamora.
He was with me
when I was riding the bicycle
and delivering newspapers at
the University of Texas Tower.
 - I was just thinking,
 you know,
I've never talked to anyone
about this before.
 [gunshot]
 [gunshot]
And I thought, you know,
maybe it'll help me,
you know, do some good
to sit and talk about it
to someone, you know, for once.
Maybe it's something
I need to do.
- If you folks had not
given us this opportunity,
I would not have seen
this cousin of mine. I do now.
Been a long time.
I mean, almost 50 years.
- It was just
a whole different world.
 Nobody ever talked about it.
- I didn't meet Claire
until, uh, a few months ago.
 - I never knew
 who Artly was.
I finally decided maybe he was
just an angel or something.
- I was 17.
I'd never seen death.
I didn't know
anything about guns.
It was nothing but a big,
raw, gaping wound,
you know, in my psyche.
In my memory.
There has been
a passage of time, and...
[stuttering]
It's still raw, but it's not
as raw as it once was.
A lotta times,
the worst days
of your lives are...
personal and, uh, private.
Maybe that's why I've...
I sort of...
[stutters]
Um, hid it inside.
 I feel guilty because
 I didn't go out soon enough.
- Oh, Artly.
- You know, that you were...
- Artly.
[laughs]
- Yeah, it's just--
I think--I think guilt
comes with events like this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Strange guilt.
 UT was closed for one day.
 That was it.
 They came in
 and cleaned up the blood.
I think the university
should put up a memorial.
There's still lots of family
and lots of friends
 of people that were
 killed and injured.
- Paul Sonntag,
Claudia Rutt,
Robert Boyer,
Billy Speed,
Roy Schmidt,
Edna Townsley,
Marguerite Lamport,
Mark Gabour,
Thomas Eckman,
Harry Walchuk,
Thomas Ashton,
Thomas Karr,
Karen Griffith,
David Gunby,
and my baby.
They said I could have babies,
but I never got pregnant.
But I got to adopt my child.
 I adopted my child Sirak.
 He was born in Ethiopia
 and I adopted him
 when he was four.
 And he's now 27.
I mean, Sirak
was a wonderful child.
And there are times,
even though
his skin is brown
and mine's white,
there are times when
I absolutely cannot remember
 that he didn't
 come out of me.
But the baby...
I-I dreamed about him
from the beginning
and I still have dreams
that I found him
and I have him
 and I'm so happy.
But then I'd look away
or something and he's gone.
 [gunshots]
 - I remember looking
at the Tower, of course, a lot.
And from the Main Mall,
you can see
there's a biblical line
from the Bible.
 "Ye shall know the truth and
the truth shall make you free."
 [gunshot]
I've thought about it.
[sniffles]
One of the truths I learned...
Is that there are monsters
that walk among us.
 [sirens wailing]
There are people out there
that think unthinkable thoughts
 and then do
 unthinkable things.
 - Through the years,
 he remained
largely kind of wooden
in my mind.
But the longer I've lived
and the more I've seen,
these precious little children
who grow up
and do sometimes
horrible things,
 the more I have come
 to think of him
 as a very confused,
 very damaged young man.
 He died at about 25.
There's a picture of him
standing at three years old,
holding a rifle on either side
on the beach.
I just think of him when
he was that three-year-old
who would have been sitting
in my lap, you know.
I'm a teacher,
and I love that age.
So much promise
and so much hope.
How can I hate
somebody like that?
I can't hate him,
in spite
of the incredible damage
that he's done.
I can't hate him.
I just can't do that.
 - Do you forgive him?
- I forgive him, yes.
How can I not forgive?
I've been forgiven so much.
