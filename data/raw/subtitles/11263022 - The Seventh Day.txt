The Psalmist's call
to hear the Lord's voice
has particular
significance for us
as we celebrate
this mass in Baltimore.
Maryland was the birthplace
of the church
in colonial America.
more than 360 years ago.
It chose today of all days.
The Holy Father
a mere stone's throw away.
I suspect that's no coincidence.
I fear this one will be
different than the others.
This one seems to have.
purpose.
Soon, Peter.
I promise.
I have complete faith in you.
A prayer before we begin.
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
May your kingdom come.
May your will be done,
as in Heaven, so on earth.
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.
Father Louis,
please come quick!
Amen.
See the cross of the Lord;
begone, hostile powers!
Peter!
The response!
Focus!
The stem of David,
the lion of Judah's tribe
has conquered.
Lord, hear my prayer.
And let my cry be heard by you.
The Lord be with you.
May He also be with you.
I cast you out, unclean spirit,
along with
all your fell companions;
in the name of Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Begone.
Nicky?
- Nicky.
- What's happening?
- Nicky, wake up.
- He's not moving.
- Wake up, Nicky!
- What have you done?
I'm talking to you, look at me!
Wake up!
What have you done to my son?
You suffocated my son.
Nicholas, wake up.
Is this your answer?
Is this your answer?
Father.
I need to confess my sins.
I know you're dying to hear
all the naughty things
I've done.
Your efforts
are wasted on me, you devil.
Hearken, therefore,
and tremble in fear, Satan, you.
you enemy of the faith,
you foe of the human race!
And what about you,
little sheep?
You look lost,
you poor dumb animal.
You corrupter of justice,
root of all evil and vice!
Scared. Alone.
Separated from your flock.
You should find yourself
a new shepherd, little sheep.
Crucified as man, but triumphed
over the powers of hell!
Don't be afraid!
Rejoice in the power!
In the possibilities!
Smile like
you've never smiled before!
Nicky!
Nicky!
One of you, make him stop.
What's happening?
Get it off her.
Now, quick!
Listen to him, Sarah!
Take it off!
I can't get it!
It's too tight.
It's pulling into my skin.
Take it off!
I command you,
unclean spirit,
along with all your minions
attacking this servant of God,
by the mysteries
of the incarnation,
the passion, resurrection,
and ascension
of our Lord Jesus Christ!
By the descent
of the Holy Spirit!
By the coming
of our Lord for judgment,
you tell me
by some sign your name,
and the day and hour
of your departure!
I command you!
No!
Father Louis, Father Louis.
No, no, no, no.
Please, you have to stay!
I'm not ready.
Please say he's okay.
Please stay with me.
Father Peter.
Please stop.
Please stop.
Please stop.
Please stop it.
No. No.
- God help us.
- Father Peter.
Oh my God.
What is happening to him?
His skin is burning!
- My son's skin is burning.
- Father Peter, please!
It's spreading.
You have to help him.
Father Peter, please.
Do something.
Sarah, just wait. I'm trying.
Michael,
we can't just stand here.
- Father Peter!
- Call someone!
- Look at me!
- Do something.
Can you help him?
Still awaiting a trial date
for Charlie Giroux,
the 12-year-old
who shocked an entire city
when just two nights ago,
he went on a killing spree,
brutally murdering
his mother, father,
and 16-year-old sister.
You can go in now.
Oh.
Thank you.
Father Daniel,
I've kept you waiting.
Forgive me.
Join us, please.
Thank you.
Father Daniel García,
I would like you to meet
Father Peter Costello.
His Excellency
has spoken so highly of you.
It's an honor.
They're sending them
straight from the seminary now?
Perhaps he looks young
because you're getting old.
Please, sit.
I've been saying to Father Peter
that you've just returned
from your training
at our new academy in Chicago
and my sources tell me
that you are.
well, you are exemplary.
Father Daniel
comes highly recommended
as our newest
and finest recruit.
How long was it?
The program.
How long was it?
Peter, don't start.
I don't make these decisions,
you know that.
Is something wrong?
No, nothing
you need concern yourself with.
Father Peter
has a difficult time
accepting the sobering
and unfortunate reality
that desperate times
do indeed require
desperate measures.
Has it been getting worse?
Despite our very best efforts,
there has been
a precipitous rise
in the number of reported
demonic possessions
throughout the nation,
but we're not giving up
the fight, are we?
No, no, we're hopeful.
no, no, we're confident
that once we've unleashed
the next wave of recruits.
Well, let's unleash, shall we?
Sorry. I thought
that was my cue.
No, that's all right, Peter.
Matter of fact,
I think we've said
all that needs to be said,
for the moment.
Good.
Will you run down the street,
get me a coffee?
Your Excellency,
always a pleasure
doing business with you.
Peter.
I guess.
Father Daniel.
A moment, please.
I know that you've
had to absorb
a great deal
in a very short time.
However, there are.
things I think
that they did not teach you
at the academy,
things that you should know.
For some years prior to
our current situation,
the Vatican adopted,
a. shall we say,
negative attitude toward
the practice of exorcism.
There were a number
of controversial cases
that unfortunately
were made public.
The situation was not
merely embarrassing.
It was untenable;
something had to be done.
So the Church
simply walked away from it.
Simply stopped teaching
the rites of exorcism.
However, it was a handful
of brave and dedicated priests,
no more than a dozen or so,
who continued to train,
and to. to study and.
and to practice in private,
underground,
despite the admonition
of the Church leadership.
Now, the most revered
of these priests
was Father Louis.
He was a man of deep, deep faith
and true personal courage.
Louis was Father Peter's mentor.
And on that very dark day,
when Louis lost his life
to a malignant
and very powerful evil,
it was Father Peter
who stepped in
to take his place.
Now, I know that he is
sometimes. unconventional,
put it that way,
but. you need to know
that Father Peter trained
with the very best.
And I feel in my heart
that I'm putting you
into good hands.
♪ Mm mm mm
Turn around turn around ♪
♪ Waoo waoo yeah! ♪
Did I do something wrong?
♪ Wooo. ♪
Did you not hear
the Archbishop?
I was one of the best
in my class.
Oh yeah, that's right!
Two grueling weeks
of exorcist nursery school.
Did you get a gold star
for that?
It actually was
pretty grueling.
Ah!
If you want, I can prove it.
Just ask me anything.
- Anything?
- Yes.
What the fuck
are you doing in my car?
What?
Why are you here?
Like, why did you
volunteer for this?
You said ask you anything.
I meant anything
about exorcisms.
And why you want to be
an exorcist
is not relevant
to that discussion?
You caught me off guard.
It's not a trick question.
I know, but.
you're making me a bit nervous.
Nervous, ah?
You realize what
we're going to be dealing with
out there today, right?
Well then, not nervous.
Anxious.
Oh, okay.
Well, that changes everything.
I mean, everyone knows
what anxiety is like for demons.
You know,
it's like kryptonite,
they're utterly
defenseless against it.
What did the Archbishop
tell you about me?
That you've been traveling
all around the country,
and you're the best
exorcist there is,
that you've been
training recruits and.
he told me about your mentor.
Father Louis.
What he didn't tell you,
I imagine,
was that after
Father Louis died,
the ten-year-old boy,
Nicholas Miller,
who I was left alone
to try and save, he also died.
You know how?
He erupted into fucking flames.
He burned to death on his bed
right in front of me,
in front of his parents.
There was nothing
I could do to help.
I failed him.
So.
that's why I'm here.
Okay. Not for some
greater good.
Not to save the world.
But because
I have a score to settle.
And until I do,
the memory of that boy's face.
in those flames.
will continue to haunt me
every day
for the rest of my life.
So. Father Daniel,
I ask you, one last time.
why are you here?
Come on, get out.
That's it?
You need to
change those clothes.
What's wrong with my clothes?
You look like a priest.
Whether you continue
on as an exorcist
or go back to writing sermons
for Sunday mass
is up to me now,
Father Daniel.
I'm giving you one day
to convince me
you're worth my time, okay?
And since you can't tell me
why you're here,
you're gonna have to
show me instead.
What am I supposed to do?
Walk up to all these people
and ask if they're possessed?
Well, riddle me this,
Mister top recruit
in his class.
How are you going to
exorcise a demon
if you can't even find it?
Gentlemen!
Can I help you with something?
Oh, we're just looking
for an old friend.
Well, you're in luck!
I know everyone there is
to know in these parts,
and they know me.
Who's your friend?
What was
that name again, Daniel?
It's, uh.
we know where to look.
Final answer?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name is Daniel.
Where is Ma?
Who?
Helen.
She usually brings my food.
Oh, I-I'm not with
the volunteers.
I actually just wanted to
ask you a few questions,
if that's okay?
I think I'm done
talking to you, Daniel.
Hey no, no, no.
Just stay with me.
Hey! I'm only gonna
tell you this one more time!
If you know what's good for you,
you and your creepy-ass friend
over there
better get on up outta here!
Now!
Yo, are you deaf?
It's-it's totally your call.
This is my house.
But I don't have my tools.
I told y'all
about coming 'round here.
What the fuck, man!
In the name of
Jesus Christ, our God and Lord,
strengthened by the intercession
of the Immaculate Virgin Mary,
- Mother of God.
- Louder!
No, no, no, no, no.
Of the blessed
Michael the Archangel
and the blessed Apostles
Peter and Paul.
Excuse me.
What's goin' on here?
George?
Are you all right?
Yo, Ma, I-I thought
they was those creeps
from the mental hospital again.
No, and I think you might wanna
call the cops or something.
Gentlemen, I think
it's time for you to leave.
Read this.
I said leave,
or I'm gonna call the cops.
Read it.
Obizuth?
You dare
to speak my name, priest?
The power of Christ compels.
- .you.
- Shhh.
I haven't tasted
such succulent lamb
in a long time.
Obizuth, fallen angel,
in the name and by the power
of our Lord Jesus Christ,
may you be snatched away
and driven from
the Church of God
and from the souls made to
the image and likeness of God
and be redeemed by the precious
blood of the divine lamb.
He with whom,
in your great insolence,
you still claim to be equal.
God who wants
all men to be saved
and to come to the knowledge
of the truth.
God the Father commands you!
God the Son commands you!
God the Holy Ghost commands you!
The sacred sign
of the cross commands you!
The faith of the holy apostles,
Peter and Paul,
and of the other apostles
commands you!
The blood of the martyrs
and the pious intercession
of all the saints commands you!
Be gone!
It's okay, Helen.
It's okay.
You're okay.
It's all right.
You knew it was her.
How?
I mean, she gives
food to the homeless!
She's a nice old lady,
there wasn't anything
- bad about it.
- Look.
this academy in Chicago,
even the one in Rome.
anyone who tells you they can
teach you this in dark rooms,
with books
and slides and lectures,
they're full of shit. Okay?
They can give you
a crucifix and holy water,
they can teach you the prayers,
but that's not what separates us
from your average
garden variety Sunday priests.
You need to be willing
to put yourself at risk. Okay?
You need to have
the strength, the faith,
the purity of heart
to allow yourself
to go to places
so dark, so terrifying,
the thought of it would
make those other priests
all piss in their vestments.
An exorcist doesn't hide
from evil, he runs toward it.
He immerses himself in it,
so that he learns
to sense it in his bones
and feel it when it's close,
because he knows
he needs to understand it
in order
to be able to defeat it,
to-to snuff it out
before it's dug in.
Evil is clever.
Demons are unpredictable.
They don't. they don't
scream their presence.
They hide in places
that we least expect them to,
so they can multiply,
so they can grow
more and more powerful,
right under our noses.
Until it's too late.
Of course I knew it was Helen,
I've been doing this
for 25 years.
Okay, now if you're ready to
follow me and listen and learn,
- and do what I tell...
- I'm ready.
Okay.
All right.
Well, let's do this.
I saw this
on the news this morning.
This is the house where
the boy murdered his family.
So what are you waiting for?
We're going in there?
No, you're going in there.
You said you were ready.
Is it even legal?
You're about to enter a house
harboring inexplicable evil,
and you're worried about
a trespassing citation?
And what do I even do
when I'm in there?
Open yourself up.
Let it in.
You're serious?
Have you listened to anything
- I've said to you today?
- Yes, yes!
I-I'm just nervous.
Trust in your faith, Daniel.
Okay? If you do that,
it can't hurt you.
I'm going in.
Yeah.
I can't have that.
Just don't drop it
this time, okay?
You never know, one day
it might come in handy.
Let it in.
Tell me where you were.
Don't you dare lie to me,
Charlie Giroux.
I swear to God.
I was at school. I swear.
He's totally lying.
I saw one of his faggot friends
posted on his story.
Shut up, Nellie!
Make me, Sally.
What did I tell you
about hanging around
with those children?
What did I say?
It was Carson's birthday!
For the last time,
you are going to
make friends here,
at your own school,
in your own neighborhood.
I don't want new friends!
A boy your age
should be playing sports.
I'm signing you up for football.
I don't want to
play football!
They're filthy,
disgusting children
from a filthy,
disgusting city
and I will not have my children
associating with.
That's okay.
She asked me
to come see you today.
To have a little
one-on-one time,
just me and you.
Do you know why?
She mentioned you might be
getting in with the wrong crowd,
and she's concerned
for your safety.
She cares about you, Charlie.
So much.
And I care about you too.
You're a very special boy.
Do you know that?
Do you know how special
you are to me?
No! No, no, no!
Charlie, no!
Please help me!
Help me.
Father Daniel.
Help me.
We need to go see the boy.
We all know
children are the most vulnerable
of the population
when it comes to possession.
That will help us
when presenting Charlie's case
to the Archbishop,
but we're still
going to need proof.
We'll need to trace it
back to the source.
Are you sure
the Archbishop can do this?
When you work for a titan
of influence and corruption,
this is one of the perks.
You should get used to it.
All right, okay.
Okay.
This is all you.
You're the one who formed
the connection at the house.
Yeah?
This is your case now.
You gotta see it through.
Are you coming or not?
I'll be right out here.
You've got five minutes.
Charlie,
my name is Father Daniel.
I know you.
From my dream.
Well, that's good.
It means we're not strangers.
Right?
You can talk to me.
It wasn't me.
- You have to believe me.
- Okay.
- I would never do that.
- I know.
I believe you.
Can you tell me when it started?
The feeling of not being you?
You know about that?
There's a man.
He started sneaking
into my room.
late at night.
He'd crawl. up my bed.
and then he'd kneel on my chest,
until I couldn't breathe.
He'd put his hand
around my neck.
And then. he said
I needed to help him.
When was the first time
you saw this man?
I-I don't know.
It. I-I remember the day.
I was. I-I was. I was at.
I was at Skate City.
Hey, it's okay.
Relax.
Charlie?
Charlie, stay with me.
Charlie!
It's in the air you breathe,
it's in the water you drink,
it's in the blood, flowing
through your veins right now.
We're everywhere, and we're
spreading like wildfire.
Something is coming, Danny-boy.
Something big.
You can't fight this,
so you might as well
just open yourself up,
and let us in.
Help, help!
Let's go.
What?
I take it you saw
our demon friend.
You could say that.
He didn't tell you his name
by any chance, did he?
No such luck.
Hmm.
Hey, we need to help him.
Do you think we have enough
to go to the Archbishop?
Well, we still haven't
found our doorway.
What about the house?
The visions I saw?
Well, the house is where
the seed was planted.
But there must have been
a-a moment
or a tool or-or something
that showed Charlie
how to get to the other side.
Did he say anything that might
have alluded to the source?
Well, he did tell me
he was with some friends
when it happened.
Some skate place, Skate City.
Okay.
That's where it happened.
I mean, it has to be.
- Maybe.
- Right?
Good, right. Come on.
Don't forget your ice pack.
He told me to let it in.
Who, Charlie?
Same thing you told me
in the house.
Of course he did.
That means we have him
right where we want him.
That's good.
You okay?
No, something's wrong.
Keep on, Carson.
Carson, stop it.
Come on, Jazzy.
Come on. Go.
We don't have time for this.
- Come on, finish him.
- You. you're Charlie's friends,
right?
We already talked to the cops.
- Come on, Jazzy!
- Oh, I-I'm not a cop.
What are you doing?
Li-listen,
I'm trying to help.
Can't you see
we're busy, dude?
Fuck off!
What the fuck!
Bro! You were about to
beat the final boss!
You don't think I know that?
I guess
that means you do have time
to talk to us now, right?
All right, fine.
What do you creeps
want to know?
Most people don't know
about this area.
We're not even
supposed to be in here.
Larry uses it to hang out
with his D&D nerds.
This is it.
Charlie used this?
It was Jazzy's fault.
She's the one who dared him
to come down here alone.
Oh, shut up, Aaron!
You dared me first.
But you were the one
who told him it was down here.
Hey, hey,
it's nobody's fault.
Just tell us what happened.
Nothing.
He said he tried it.
That's pretty much it.
No! He said
it worked, Aaron.
It made his hands move!
Dude!
He was bullshitting!
That stuff isn't real.
That's what you think?
Spirits are not real?
Maybe we need to
find out for ourselves.
Okay.
Ready.
Aaaand. action.
Is there a spirit in the room
with us right now?
I'm speaking to the demon
that possessed Charlie.
If you're in here with us.
give us a sign.
Charlie said it worked.
Keep going.
We were having
a conversation earlier.
We didn't finish it.
You asked me to help you.
How do I help you?
Charlie. No, no!
Charlie, no!
What happened?
Dude.
You really
weren't moving that?
What did it spell?
"Evil."
This.
this was foolhardy.
Do you have any idea
of the danger
you've subjected yourself to?
It was. it was my idea.
You should have known better.
Are you all right?
Father Daniel, look at me.
- I said look at me.
- I'm fine!
Your Excellency, I'm. I'm fine.
Good.
It does appear we have
a case of demonic possession.
Unfortunately.
I just. I don't know what.
what's to be done.
We have no way of gaining access
to the boy, Charlie.
What? Why?
I've spoken to the judge,
not two hours ago.
Even now I think Charlie
is undergoing evaluation
to see if he's competent
to stand trial.
They want to move on this
as quickly as possible.
We need to be there!
We need to see him.
I'm afraid
that's not possible.
Well then, make it possible.
What do you mean,
it's not possible?
I don't think
you quite understand.
No, no, no!
I'm not giving up on this.
- I've been through a lot.
- Daniel.
- You don't seem to get it.
- Daniel.
Just let me speak
with the Archbishop
alone for a moment.
Father Daniel,
welcome back.
How's your first day?
I've had better.
I'm sorry to hear that.
If you don't mind me saying,
you do look a little
worse for the wear.
Then I feel how I look.
Probably shouldn't do this,
but. you know what?
Here's my nephew's
contact information.
His name is Kevin.
Father Kevin Dunleavy.
He's an absolutely lovely boy,
though I admit I'm a bit biased.
Anyway, maybe he can help you,
as someone who's
already been through this.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hm. Not at all.
We're relying on you boys
for so much.
Anything I can do to help.
So, we have our permission
to proceed with the exorcism.
Wait, we're doing
the evaluation?
The old man called in a favor.
We'll be able to observe,
but that's about it.
But don't worry,
we'll figure something out.
I think as long as we're there,
we'll have the chance
to get to him.
You sure you're up for this?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I mean, if you want to talk
about what happened...
I said I'm fine!
We're wasting time.
Can you tell me
what you remember
about the night your sister
and parents died, Charlie?
Did something happen
that made you mad at them?
How about your sister, Nellie?
What was your relationship
with her like?
What about the school, Charlie?
How-how you are doing at school?
You-do you get good grades...
You need to go in there.
Look at him.
He's nearly all the way gone.
If we wait any longer,
they're gonna lock him
in a mental hospital
and then what good
are we gonna be to him?
Do you make friends in school?
Do you think you can get it
to show itself again?
These people need to witness
what you saw before.
Are you in charge here?
We need to talk to Charlie.
Um, excuse me.
You-you can't come in here.
Hey Charlie,
do you remember me?
I came to see you earlier.
We had a good talk, didn't we?
You told me about the man.
The one that visited you
in your room.
You see, the thing is,
I think he visited me too.
But I'm just not sure.
So I was hoping
you could describe him to me.
The man?
Yes.
The-the one you told me about.
He was tall.
Tall, that's. that's good.
What else?
He had a beard.
He had long hair and sandals.
Okay.
His hands.
and feet.
They looked
something like that!
Ring any bells for you,
Danny-boy?
You want to know what I remember
about that night?
Jesus!
I remember their screams,
begging for their pitiful
little lives.
I remember my axe,
tearing into their flesh,
cracking their bones like twigs.
I remember their blood,
and their delicious
cries of pain.
And finally,
after it was all done,
I remember relishing
in my masterpiece,
and reveling in the realization.
that we're only
just getting started.
- Great! Are you okay?
- No.
Okay, I am sorry
that has happened.
It's almost time, Daniel.
Nicky!
Nicky!
What did you do?
What did you do to him?
Make him stop!
 Nicky!
No! No! No! No!
Father Peter!
He's gone.
Impossible.
What are you waiting for? Go!
What the.
Hello?
Are you all
seeing this out there?
What the hell was that?
There's
something in here!
Jesus.
Get it off me!
What is happening?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Daniel.
Hello?
It's Father Daniel.
Oh, thank God!
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. You?
Yeah.
Have you seen Father Peter?
No. I-I was hiding.
I-I haven't seen anyone.
I just came...
Help!
Danny-boy.
Here I come.
Excuse me.
Ma'am, we need help.
I'm sorry, but...
I won't run from you, Charlie.
I know you can hear me!
You can fight this!
We can get through
this together.
You have to trust me!
You have to trust me!
Charlie, look at me!
Charlie, Charlie, look at me.
What's happening to me?
Oh, yes. There you are.
It's okay. It's okay.
I've got you.
I've got you.
No.
It's him.
The man.
How long
will the sedative last?
Long enough.
The boy. the one that died
during your first exorcism.
How did it happen?
It was simple.
The demon was.
was the strongest
I've ever seen.
I guess you were just lucky
to get out of there alive.
Sure.
Look, an innocent young soul
was completely destroyed
by evil that day,
under my watch.
So, yeah, I'm lucky to be alive.
You know what I witnessed?
It's the epitome of darkness.
Worse than death, if you ask me.
I would just pray that
you never have to experience
anything like that yourself.
I thought you might need these.
They were. handed down
to me from my mentor.
And now it's your turn.
And did you believe in.
in your other recruits?
The way you do with me?
When I was done with them, yes.
It's just, you've been
training all these exorcists.
But the Archbishop says that
things still keep getting worse,
- and it just...
- Enough, enough!
There's a young boy
in that other room,
whose life you hold
solely in your hands.
Okay?
You and you alone
are responsible
for whatever happens
to him tonight.
That's what you should be
focused on, nothing else.
Do you understand?
Okay, good.
He'll be awake soon,
so be ready.
Hello?
Hey!
Hey, hello.
Is this Father Kevin Dunleavy?
Speaking.
Yeah, sorry to bother you.
- This is...
- Father Daniel.
Yes, I know.
Oh, your aunt
told you I was...
Don't be afraid.
You're so close.
So close. to what?
Just one final task,
and you'll be with us.
You won't regret it, Daniel.
I promise.
I'm-I'm sorry.
Who is "us"?
Father Peter!
You. you scared me.
I was. I was praying.
It's time.
Father Daniel, please.
It's okay, Charlie.
I'm here with you
and I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.
You trust me,
don't you, Charlie?
Well, good.
Because I trust you.
That means we're a team now.
And we're in this together.
Okay?
Father Daniel.
Let's begin.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Amen.
Most glorious prince
of the heavenly Armies,
Saint Michael the Archangel,
defend us in our battle
against principalities
and powers,
against the rulers
of this world of darkness,
against the spirits of
wickedness in the high places.
Come to the assistance of men,
whom God has created
to His likeness,
and whom He has redeemed
at a great price
from the tyranny of the devil.
Ahhh!
Hey Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, fight it.
Father, the prayer.
The Holy Church venerates you,
as her guardian and protector;
to you, the Lord has entrusted
the souls of the redeemed
to be led into heaven.
We pray there
for the God of peace
to crush Satan
beneath our feet.
Aaaah!
- Charlie!
- Focus!
- Charlie!
- Focus! You need to be stronger!
More forceful!
Pray, therefore,
to the God of peace,
to crush Satan beneath our feet,
that he may no longer retain
men captive
and do injury to the Church!
Offer our prayers
to the most high,
that without delay they may draw
His mercy down upon us.
Take hold of the dragon!
The old serpent,
which is the devil and Satan!
Bind him and cast him
into the bottomless pit!
That he may no longer
seduce the nations.
Danny-boy,
you came back for more.
I knew you would.
You're drawn to me, aren't you?
Like two peas in a pod,
you and me.
Charlie, if you can hear me,
I'm here with you.
Listen to my voice,
follow my voice.
It's what it wants!
Charlie cannot help you.
No one can help you.
It's up to you to fight this!
What are you waiting for?
Yes, come on, Danny-boy.
Let's get on with it.
In the name of Jesus Christ,
our God and Lord!
Strengthened by the intercession
of the Immaculate Virgin Mary,
Mother of God!
Of blessed Michael
the Archangel!
Of the blessed Apostles Peter
and Paul and all the saints!
And powerful in the holy
authority of our ministry,
we confidently undertake
to repulse the attacks
and deceits of the devil!
Let God arise!
Let his enemies be scattered!
Let those who hate him
also flee before him.
As smoke is driven away,
so drive them away.
As wax melteth before the fire,
let the wicked perish
at the presence of God!
Charlie, Charlie!
The prayer, Father!
No, no, I heard him! It's him!
No, it's the demon!
It's preying on your weakness.
You have to fight!
Behold the cross of the Lord,
flee bands of enemies.
The lion of the tribe of Judah,
the offspring of David,
hath conquered!
May Thy mercy,
Lord, descend upon us.
As great as our hope in Thee!
Ah! It burns.
Father Daniel, it burns!
Finish it, Daniel!
You're almost there!
You're doing it!
All satanic powers,
all infernal invaders,
all wicked legions,
and the. the.
Ten-year-old boy,
Nicholas Miller.
He burned to death on his bed,
right in front of me.
The demon was the strongest
I've ever seen.
Evil is clever.
Demons are unpredictable.
They don't scream
their presence.
They hide in places
where we least expect them.
Why're you here?
Daniel! You can't let up!
Drive it out!
Most cunning serpent!
You shall no more dare
to deceive the human race.
What are you doing?
The most high God commands you!
He with whom,
in your great insolence,
you still claim to be equal!
Have you lost your mind?
God, who wants all men
to be saved!
And to come to the knowledge
of the truth.
God the Father commands you!
God the Son commands you!
God the Holy Ghost commands you!
I am warning you. Stop this!
I'm not stopping, Peter.
Or do you want to tell me
your real name?
Very clever, Daniel. Bravo.
No, I'm not quite finished
with you yet.
You're trying to be brave, yeah?
You're trying to be strong
and I applaud you for that.
But you know what you
really are. deep down?
You're a coward.
You're a lost little sheep,
looking for a shepherd.
I'm not a coward.
I know exactly why I'm here.
We'll see.
Is that all you got?
Charlie isn't the first,
Daniel.
And he won't be the last.
We've all made sacrifices,
Daniel.
It's not real.
Ah!
The heavens
and the earth were finished,
and all the host of them.
On the seventh day, God finished
his work which he had made;
and he rested on the seventh day
from all his work
which He had made.
Even your almighty God
had to take a breather
from time to time, Daniel.
Hmm! Ripe!
You recall me telling you
losing that boy,
Nicholas Miller,
was worse than death?
That was a lie.
Death is infinitely worse.
Especially the death
I have planned for you,
if you don't do what I want.
Oh, Daniel,
this was supposed to be easy.
You kill the boy, and you
take on our demon friend.
I mean, this waste of a soul
Father Peter did it.
Look how that worked out.
I swear,
if you touch that boy.
I had you primed
like an empty vessel,
ready to be filled.
All you had to do
was complete the exorcism!
I mean, you are an exorcist!
Yes, it's all there in the name!
If you're so powerful,
and I'm so weak,
why do you need me?
A war needs an army.
An army needs soldiers.
I'll never fight for you.
You won't have a choice.
You always a choice!
I'm sorry.
No. I thank you.
Thank you.
Daniel, not now, Daniel.
Did you think you'd be
rid of me that easily?
Don't fight it.
Let me in.
No! No!
You can't deny
the truth, Daniel.
You can feel it.
No, no,
you're not getting that.
I'm not letting you.
I'm not letting you. Just stop.
There's no place
for you here, not anymore.
Leave me alone.
Just relax.
Let it take hold.
Feel the power, Daniel.
Feel the possibility.
Smile, Daniel.
It's almost over.
You can rest soon.
Hey, Charlie.
It's gone.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
This is all of them.
Every recruit
trained by Father Peter.
Without Father Peter's
influence,
your second exorcism of Charlie
was flawless, Father Daniel.
He's recuperating downstairs
as we speak.
I think it best to keep this
within the leadership for now.
Thank you for these.
You know, Daniel.
this really
isn't your responsibility.
The Vatican is completely aware
of the situation
and has a plan to take...
No offense.
Your Excellency,
to you or the Vatican.
but I don't want to wait for
someone else to do what's right.
You've got quite a journey
ahead of you.
Yeah.
Will you take care of Charlie?
He'll be fine.
I give you my word.
