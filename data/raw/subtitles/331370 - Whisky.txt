You got that right.
Marta, -
- here is a little present for you.
Oh, that wasn't necessary.
- Thank you.
- No big deal.
So nice and warm.
That is a new collection we are making.
Do you know where we sell most? In Chile.
Chileans are so friendly.
Now im cleaning the table.

- No thanks.
Thats the future doctor in the family.
The youngest looks a little bit like mother,
dont you think?
Maybe a little.

She didnt recognise people.
She thought i was father.

Excuse me.
Jacobo,

- Do you mean this one?
- No, the one with thumbs up.
Very good.
I want to make these to my customers.
They dont hold many sheets.
I wanted to make some -
- with the firm's logo and a calendar.
But it was too expensive.
A magnet with calendar.
So sad Marta wouldnt join us.
She doesnt like football.
Didnt we just pass by the plant?
- Yes.
- Couldnt we drop by?
No, then we will be late.
Come on! Lets drop by.

- What can one do, buddy?
- Yes, i wonder.
- Whats the score?
- They are three points ahead of us.
Ey, Jacobo.
That catalog you have in your bathroom,
its abit old fashioned.
I used to have those machines earlier.
They are good, they are Italian, but . . .
- Whos the side ref?
- Barcelo.
- He blew it for us once.
- Yes, that penalty...
If you want to modify the plant,
i can help you.
We could import socks
from BRAZIL and sell them here.
Its a good product. I have
some samples you can show your customers.
Go, go, go! NO!!!!
Dickface!
You always ruin it for us!
Fuckface!
Ram that flag up your ass, you cuntfaced hooker!
- Iguacu-falls were nice, werent they?
- Yes, very nice.
I've lived in BRAZIL for 20 years,
but never been there.
Not that i live very close,
but its not a long drive.
I will soon
bring my family there.
- Yes it is beautiful there.
- Yes, it is.
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.
Two of these, please.
- Do you like them, Marta?
- Yes.
I want to go on vacation,
but i cant.
There`s so much to do at the plant.
Do you like those?
- Yes .
- Two more .
But i cant complain.
Its good just to have a job.
- Definetely.
- One more of those.
Of course, its important to have work.
My father, old Koller, always used to say...
Can i have three of these?
One has to work, he said.
He was a special man.
I watched him work all day.
I probably look like him.
One of these, please.
Every day when I see the plant,
im thinking of him.
- Do you want something more, Marta?
- No.
That was everything.
There was an awful silence,
and then he said:
"It must have fallen off,
because I never lose anything."
"It must have fallen off,
because I never lose anything."
Hold on, Marta. Just one more.
It is good and very short.
Old Isaac laid on his deathbed,
and his whole family was with him.
He was dying, and then he said:
"Rebecca, are you here?"
"Yes, daddy, im here."
"and you, Judith, my beloved wife?"
"Yes, Isaac, im here."
"Are you here, Samuel, my dear son?"
"Yes, daddy, im here."
"If everyone is here, who is
looking after the store then?"
- Who is looking after the store?
- Excuse me.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming, Isaac.
Hello?
I would like to talk
to Herman Koller?
Hello? Hello?

but i didnt find it.
I didnt have my creditcard,
I had nothing.
So i went to talk to the owner.
And do you know where this happened?
- At Tony Ramos restaurant.
- Tony Ramos?
He got a restaurant
right where i live.
Think of what my daughters would have said!
"So embarrassing, and in front of Tony Ramos!"
Do you know Tony Ramos in person?
We are not friends, but we have talked
sometimes. Tony is a nice guy.
Brasilian soapsoperas are so good.
The sets, the actors, or what?
We dont watch it at home.
But they are investing a lot of money in it.
When do you need to be
at the airport tomorow?
He is throwing me out ! Please !
Let us finish this one first.
Come on. Its so little left.
Let us toast.
It was nice to see you again
after such a long time.
Id would like to propose
a toast for this meeting.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
This visit was fantastic,
but it was too short.
Thats why id like to invite you.
Do you want to come with me
to Piriapolis for a couple of days.
- What do you say, Marta?
- Id love to.
The guy who repairs shades
will be on the plant tomorow.
- But, Jacobo! When was the last time you were there?
- This is not a good time.
He needs to repair the window shade.
Do you want to tell him?
Say it yourself, Marta.
- No, i get embarrassed.
- It was only a joke.
Marta told me that you
still like chocolate.
When i talked with the counterman,
and when nobody saw it, -
- Marta stole a chocolate.
A present for you, Jacobo.
- Pay attention to the road please.
- That was funny.
Breakfast is included and
is served between seven and ten o'clock.

It is easy.
Jacobo can teach you.
He used to always beat me.
Come on, Marta.
Just like that.
A little bit harder.
Thats good.
You are two against one.
I cant beat Jacobo.
- I lost.
- Lets play one more.
I'll buy another token.

- Yes.
And you havent been here for a while?
Yes, havent been here
for a very long time.
- And your brother?
- The same, i think.
Why did'nt your brother show
up when your mom died?
What do you think?
That was expensive.
I'll buy water downstairs.
I can't sleep without water.
Not me either.
Did you also have trouble sleeping?
I went out to buy water,
it was too expensive here.
Could you please wait
for my husband?
- Yes, of course.
- Thanx.
- Thanx.
- Don't mention it.

- Fifth.
Thanx.
- Are you newly married?
- Yes.
- Honeymoon?
- Yes.
We are from Argentina. We love Uruguay.

Its not that long ago since he was
by the Iguacu-falls.
There it is very beautiful.
I lost.

I listen to conversations and spelled them
backwards. That how i learned it.
"Jacobo is exasperated."
Obocaj si detarepsaxe.

I'm supposed to push here, right?
Smile and say "whisky".

- Damn.
- What has happened ?
- She has lost a ring.
- Wedding ring?
- Yes.
Are you sure you wore it ?
Rings dont fall off by themselves.
- Yes, they do fall off in water.
- That was strange.
We split the pool in two.
I search here, and you search over there.
- Do you take off your ring often ?
- Sometimes
You need to ask the reception for help.
The pool is big when you search for
a ring. Or write a letter to them.
- Was it real gold?
- Yes.
Hi ! Here it is !
- Thank you.
- So good !
- Ill put it over here.

- Do you want me to come along ?
- No, thanx.
Ill see you later, Marta.
Ees uoy retal.
"See you later." backwards.
Excuse me.
Jacobo.
It's not easy for me
to be away from mom -
- when i knew that you cared for her.
And you took care of the plant also.
My job and family required that
i was there.
I couldn't help you
during your hard time.
Look here.
I want to give you these
as a kind of compensation.
Its a lot of money.
Its a compensation for the
time you used with mom.
And it cover my share of the expenses.
A little extra for all those years
you cared for her.
I'll manage fine, Herman.
I dont need that money.
I think you will need it
now that you are married.
We manage well.
- You can get cheap soap.
- No thanx.
You can use them to buy new italian
machinery for your plant.
Applause for Francisca from Montevideo.
We are going to play more hits for you.
I'll hope you like this one.
Herman promised
he would sing today.
- Did you know he could sing ?
- No.
Im not a real singer.
Sometimes I'll visit a karaoke bar
with my daughter.
- Do you want to sing now ?
- It's kinda embarrassing.
Number 24 never wins.
Its waste of money.
It's your birthday, honey.
I will never play it again.
I said you shouldnt play 24.
You did it anyway.
Of course.
How is it going with the girls?
Good.
Ok.
Good afternoon.
- Do you want me to exchange everything?
- Yes, everything.
Hold on a moment please.
Keep the bet.
Black 24.

Thank you.
- Thanx.
- Thanx, Jacobo. It is too much.
- They are nice.

If i could have travelled somewhere,
i would have travelled to Brazil.
A good choice.
Brazil is a beautiful country.
I travel alot,
I am almost never at home.
- Have a nice trip.
- Thanx.
- Have a nice trip.
- Goodbye.
- Im ready.
- Im going to call a taxi for you.
No, thats not necessary.
I'll take the bus.
Need a car to Yata street 1421.
It's an apartment building.
It will arrive in three minutes.
Oh, yes.
- You shouldnt have done that.
- It's a kind of compensation.
That was not necessary.
- I'll see you tomorow.
- I'll see you tomorow, god permitting.
Koller, is your team going to
advance to first division ?
Your team is a joke, Koller.
- Good morning.
