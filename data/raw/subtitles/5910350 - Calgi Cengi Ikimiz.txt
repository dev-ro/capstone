WILL YOU MARRY ME?
Thank God we had enough today.  Affectation...
...you understand
why I called you here.
Now the day has come.
We will leave the mafia.
Salih, it seemed like you were
going to say something else.
Well...
Well, come on, his day has come too.
Zilli baby, tell your parents, we will come
to ask for you whenever they are available.
Is this your marriage proposal, Salih?
Baby, we have been together for 3 years.
For two and a half years you have
been pestering me to get married.
If I propose to you
now, will you say no?
-Why should I ask a question I know the answer to?
-Are you serious?
Is it necessary?  If you want, let me ask.
Go on, ask.  Sir.
-Gurkan.
-Why?
You know, auntie's son, let me ask you.
Do I need to propose?
I don't even think there is a need for marriage, uncle's son.
You are an artist man.
Married at a young age...
...why would you break the
hopes of your female fans?
The artist is public property,
think of it like a fountain of wonder.
Everyone should be able to keep their mouth shut.
Are you my diaper, son?
Only one person uses it.
So you're saying no.
He basically said there was
no need for a marriage proposal.
Sir, I think there is.
You have to offer.
He can use it as evidence against you in the future,
it will upset you and make you tired of life.
Long marriage is a matter of tactics.
Thank you very much.
-I continue.
-Brother Bünyamin, thank you.
Brother Bünyamin and Gürkan will come to
every meeting of ours, I understand that...
...why don't they sit at the same table?
Everyone is looking at us.
Sister-in-law...
...when we sit at the same table, we talk
among ourselves and cannot listen to you.
Just like we can't meet secretly
from your mother, it's the same thing.
My mother, enjoy your meal.
Go ahead!
This woman couldn't
love me either, it's a lie.
Look at the adjective, plainclothes police.
He wouldn't manipulate your father, would he?
-Tsk
-No, if it were up to your mother, she wouldn't give it to me.
If he wants, don't give it to him.  I'll run away.
Don't talk ignorantly, girl.
Are such things left?
Can you start a family with a girl
who left her own family and ran away?
We will convince your beautiful family.
This is our main duty.
Brother Salih!
We're running late bro, pack it up if you want.
Are these from you too?
-How many people came?
-Six of us came.
I said let's talk in a luxury restaurant...
I said, "Animal, how many of us are
there? Is the money enough?"  I said.
So I arranged a wedding at this restaurant,
they will perform in half an hour.
In short, the food was free, auntie.
We are their spoon team.
Naz, we will still
wear our stage clothes.
Just tell your father, whatever
day he says, we are with you.
-Gurkan.
-Salih.
Come on, let's not be late.  Come on.
How?
Are we getting married now?
Let's get out of the mafia,
that's our first job, my Naz.
Relax, auntie.  How difficult
could it be to get out of the mafia?
No, so what is it?
My aunt's child.
Nobody listened to our composition at the wedding.
The runway was instantly empty, you saw it too.
There were people who thought the wedding was over and
left.  I told you.  “Don't write meaningful words.”
There is a formula for this: The chorus will be meaningless
and the lyrics will stay in your mind.  Remember.
<Freckled bom bom bom>
<Freckled bom bom bom>
<Ooo, freckles>
<Freckle baby, freckles>
<Oh, freckles, freckles>
Exit.
Will we always do the same
thing just because it worked once?
What once?
No way.  Meaningless, meaningless things.
Baby, we need a meaningless chorus
"A papır ceyn, pair ap
Papir ceyn, papir up”
Tell me what this means,
I will lose my front teeth.
God's horse mouth.
Do you think it's Turkish?
The late Cem Karaca
was saying this, my son.
Son, that's what you said: "Hanigidi
hüpbap yenigidi bapbap, rep rep."
“Wish, wish, wish,” said the lie.
Hah, that's my aunt's child.
It should be like this.
The melody overtook the song.
Aunt is calling every morning.  Hungry.
Gurkan.  We talked about this with you.
You know, you wouldn't be jealous.
His place is different, your place is different, my child.
“We will lay out a mattress for you in
our love nest with your aunt.”  we said.
-Hello.  <* -Salih!>
I talked to my father.  “Let them
come to ask whenever they want.”  said.
“We are always at home anyway.”  said.
<* -How nice.>
The news is great.
Why does your voice sound bad, dear?
My mother said, "There is cleaning tomorrow, let them
come this evening while the house is dirty."  said.
<* Ha, I get it.>
Ok.  Ok.
My aunt's son, my mother-in-law
is squeezing the fixture.
We need to ask for Naz urgently this evening.
Let me inform brother Bünyamin, wait.
How nice, uncle's son.  We will go and
get out of the mafia towards the evening.
We want the girl in the evening.
THAT NIGHT IS TONIGHT, COME ON HORSE
The weekend is left to us.
We go to the internet cafe and throw Counter.
Isn't it?  Isn't it?
My baby
My baby is calling.
Baby, this is ours.  Baby, baby.
Dude, why don't you register
the man with his name?
Where have you been, baby?  The wedding has started.
Sir, we are off today.
And what kind of wedding is it at
11:00 in the morning?  Make no mistake.
Are they going to ask you
when they will get married?
The egg stuck to the ass.
They had to get married immediately.
The bride is 9 months and 10 days pregnant.
They are racing against time.
These guys came by decorating
the ambulance as a bridal car.
<* Come on, jump in the taxi and come right away!>
Yes, sir.  We are coming.
A person asks a question.  “Do you
have money for a taxi?”  says baby.
I got burned.
Fuck your mother.
-No swearing.  No swearing.
-Son, don't do it.  Don't be a jerk to the tradesmen.
Gokmen.
Wow Wow wow.
The headliners of my credit book have arrived.
I wonder how I can
help our art community?
Give me two twenties and a fiver from there.  We
will take a taxi.  We are very late for work.
Should I give it from the cash register or from outside?
Friends, this goes beyond the limits
of credit.  This is considered a debt.
Has our friendship strengthened that much?
Never mind me, people are getting fed up.
You owe a debt to the flying bird.
We only owe our lives to the flying bird.
It's no joke.
Yesterday, a bird landed on our
balcony and this criminal ate that bird.
The bird collected twigs to make a nest, burned
it with those twigs, cooked it and ate the animal.
This is the villain.
He is such a villain.
The bird was injured.  The animal
was walking hopping.  What do I do?
Is this a horse?
Bird, bird.  It has wings and flies.  Can someone
kill himself just because his leg is injured?
Wow, this baby makes me...
Come on, baby.
My dear, you can handle it too.
Gökmen, how long can I manage?
Gökmen, you've made it longer now.
Forgive the money you gave
me and let this conversation end.
-Shall I say goodbye?
-Yes.
So you won't pay it back.
Damn, has our friendship
strengthened that much?  Well done!
Take me, coach, take me away.
That's friendship.
This is a separate malfunction.
Those who buy on credit think they
are friends, avel.  Whoever deceived this.
I deceived you, son.
“A friend does not calculate money
for a friend.  If we don't pay you...
"..we're not doing this because
we consider you a friend," I said.
My son was a bum who stole a sofa bed.
We made it a business powerhouse.
So let's be a little coy.
<My horse is black>
<I am black aman>
<Especially my hometown>
<Ankara, wow>
<Especially my hometown>
<Ankara, wow>
<Dı-dı-dı Diyar Wedding Hall>
<B-b-b-Bağcılar>
<Ha-ha-ha-pool>
<Auntie's son, let there be no one left without playing.>
<Hit the spoon.  Hit.>
<Hit.>
The day we joined the mafia,
we had fun until the morning.
How do we know that we have
joined the morale team of the mafia?
They've been making us musicians
for six years, at mafia weddings.
Damn baby, what kind of mafia are we?
My baby.
Even the mafia was dazzled by the
shine of the gold bracelet on our arms.
They're cashing it in.  They are
taking advantage of our art, Gürkan.
We need to confront
these and talk urgently.
“We are leaving the mafia now.”  We have to say.
Finished.
There is lime in this.
<Shaking all over>
<With honeyed lips>
<Untie my top button><Leave the
rest to me>
<Shaking all over>
<With honeyed lips>
<Untie my top button><Leave the
rest to me>
Damn brother, our wages
haven't been paid for months.
The landlord personally went to
foreclosure for the accumulated rent debt.
He bought all the items he had his eye on.
We can't go home.
Of course you are ashamed.
Exit.
He's pulling stones, man.  The
landlord even bought the carpets, I swear.
Let's make sure we pay the rent this month.
We have nothing left
to give but our dignity.
Brother, we are also opposite.
Aha, buying pita from the
bakery on credit during Ramadan...
...we made a living by selling it for tiko
money to the people at the back of the queue.
We converted the loan into cash, son.
There is a power outage at home.  The water is out.
Finally, we paid for natural gas with the last
money in our pocket, so that we wouldn't be cold...
...and that's because the combi boiler
doesn't work when there's a power outage.
We really bet on the wrong horse.
What, are we going to compete with our poverty?
As you can see, we
are all in a bad situation.
Baby, we're a team.
<We are especially devastated, woe to us too>
<Oh, our situation is devastated, woe to us too>
<My suck is silver>
<I like it, wow>
<I was up from yesterday morning>
<I'm drunk, wow>
<My suck is silver>
<I like it, wow>
<I was up from yesterday morning>
<I'm drunk, wow>
<Bravo master.  Bravo, master.><May God make you
grow old on a pillow.>
<Didn't anyone throw money?>
Brother, shouldn't you be in a
hurry to get out of this mafia?
You found this job for us.
You know the bosses.
Save our money, just
get out of the mafia.
No, they haven't been
paying anyone for months.
The men receive their salaries as
extortion from their salaried employees.
So money is always in the air.
Well.
-There is no money in sight.
-No.
This is how America fell into crisis, brothers.
What's wrong with us baby?  We solved our
own problem, is that all there is to it?
No, Gürkan, say something.
Should we hire another
mafia to get our levans?
Exit.
It's already so ridiculous.
I didn't say anything like that.
Let's do it this
way, they called us.
After the wedding, we will
go directly to the warehouse.
Come 10 minutes after us.
Say, “It doesn't work like that.
There is no end to this.  "We don't know
you, we know Salih and Gürkan."  say.
"If you don't pay, we will take
our salaries and money."  say.
“If they don't have money, we will take their lives.”  say!
Grit your teeth like that!
Give us two hits in the mouth and face.
The calf of the leg...
The inner part of the calf hurts a lot.
Tighten there too.
Hello, I have a callus on my right foot.
You press there.  Hulusi...
...Gürkan also has hemorrhoids,
you go there too-- -Whoop!
Horse mouth.  Son, in your dream world, can't
two people communicate by talking?  Sit down.
Son, no swearing or beating.
Just talk tough.
Brother.
I have hemorrhoids too, brother.
Three heads.
Don't be upset.
Stress triggers.
Gürkan, listen carefully, I'm saying it for the last time.
The chorus of the song will be meaningless,
but the lyrics will be memorable.
Don't look, son, this is the formula.
Tarkan implemented it.
Cuppa cuppa cuppa Gürkan.
Gee.
Yes baby, I'm listening.
My dear brother, we have talked about
this before.  We want to quit our job.
But of course your opinion is much
more important to us because for us...
...you know better than us what is
better, because you are our brother.
Honey, that's easy.
Why did you say it so timidly?
What do we know bro?  "It's very difficult to
get out of the mafia," he told us.  they said.
Who said?
Upholsterer Numan Usta.
What does the upholsterer know about these things?
We'll open the books and see.
What do you owe us and what do we owe you?
After that we will send it.
We will also get our money.  Thank God.  After
we get the money, let's go to Naz immediately.
We will watch the match coyly.
There is a national match in the evening.
After all, you have to watch it, it's
the national match, right Gürkan?
If you're not in a hurry, we'll hold you for a while.
Reason?
You must have heard of our brother İsmet a lot.
I think.  He will meet you today.
It's about to come.
Why would he want to meet us?
I really couldn't ask.
You know sweetheart.
When it comes, you ask yourself.
How many families do I look after?
Brave heart.
We have heard of İsmet
Bey's reputation before, but
we have never had the
chance to see his face before.
How should we act?  What is he like?
So far they have always described us as a
man who flies and runs away, like Superman.
You heard right.  Our brother is flying.
-What is he doing?
-Fly.
How does he fly?
Our brother İsmet has 17 bodyguards.
17 guards?
Who is this brother's enemy?
Is oil coming out of its soil?
What are 17 protections?
No, our brother İsmet is a master in close combat.
The bodyguards are not
there to protect brother İsmet...
...To protect the other person if
İsmet brother tries to beat someone.
17 people can barely restrain our brother.
Throw.
The dishonorable person gets into trouble
when he goes out without protection.
He beats anyone who comes across him.
He returned to the Bebe Korkut stories.
Where is this brother İsmet?  Let's see too.
Daddy is never late.
It doesn't come early either.
Five.
Four.
Fly.
Two.
One.
Four.
Three and a half.
Brother doesn't make mistakes.
-Go ahead.
-We talked about you passing first.
Give way.
These are our babies.
My friend, now is not the time.
Please come out.  Go, get out.
In order?
You're making a fuss when
it comes to giving our money.
They don't eat.
Look at me, I'm talking tough.
They don't eat!
What more can I say?
Son, now is not the time.
Get out and go!
Don't make the man swear!
Who are you baby?
We are the men you have been working for months
for a penny and not paying them their dues.
Salih and Gürkan found this job for us.
Either take our money from them
or we know how to take it from them.
Otherwise, we have no issue with you.
I didn't swear anyway.
You didn't.  God bless you.
Our problem is with them, we don't know you.
Then let's meet, gentlemen.
I'm İsmet.
Our brother İsmet.
Uncle La, don't make a signal.
We came here and took our turn first.
Get in line!
What are you looking at?
Is there something upside down?  What?
What son?
I had fun too.
Don't you understand words?
I say row, row.
Hey, you're the only one awake.
Look how many people are waiting.
That's how they package the man.
See death and leave it alone.  If I
don't beat this, it will cause me trouble.
I get sick.  Leave it alone.
Brother, babies are not guilty.
Let me love your eyes.
Let me go!
We are their elders.
We beat them.
If we love you at
all, we save your life.
One minute.
It isn't happening.
Get these.  Hit their joints
so that they cannot stand up.
One minute.  One minute.
It's not working, baby.  It isn't happening
Get these.
I swear it's because we were thinking of you.
Well, it's for your own good, my son.
Brother Salih, I appreciate the goodness that comes from you.
Don't swear, baby.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Brother, what more will you give us?
Pickaxe and shovel?
There are only a few men
whose graves we haven't dug yet.
That's what I was going to say.
That's enough.
You've got a terrible feeling
of violence inside you, baby.
Yes, we are.
The aim is to ensure that our brother İsmet does not
get tired.  Where is brother İsmet?  Where is Ismet?
On the back of your neck.
Damn son, did I tell
you to shoot?  Ha?
I just made a noise to scare you.
Oh my God, I can't beat people,
I can't say anything to anyone.
Am I an ornament?
I can't enjoy it.
I don't enjoy my job.
Remove them from here.
Pick them up and take them home.
Let them come to my study tomorrow.
I will talk to them there.
Damn?
Wake up and wake up.  Gurkan.
Salih.
Damn?
What is our current situation?
What do I know?
Gürkan, I will tell you something
now, but being afraid, shouting...
...no panicking or
making stupid moves.
-Damn man, what could be worse?
-I've been shot, son.
You never say anything, son.
They shot me in the shoulder, Gürkan.
They couldn't find a bandage, so
they covered the wound with duct tape.
They also plugged the
bullet hole with newspaper.
They taped it, Gürkan.  It's like the
pimp is covering the chimney hole!
Does it hurt?
It doesn't hurt, Gurkan.
I got shot but it doesn't hurt.
I'm Superman!
Get up and look at that door!
-Come brother, come.
-Son, why don't you open the door?
We are running late.
I was going to call a locksmith, huh.
Brother Bünyamin, strange things happened.
Now when we said we would go
out to the mafia, the guns spoke.
We fainted from fear, brother.
We opened our eyes and we were at home.
Brother, just between us,
they shot me in the carom.
-Does it hurt?
-It doesn't hurt, bro.
Good morning my baby.
It's like they didn't hit him, they kissed him.
This is lead, lead.
What does this say, Gürkan?
Brother Bünyamin, the men brought him to the
house and made him sit in the living room...
...and they changed us, brother.
They made the men wear national team jerseys
so that they would watch the national match.
Don't you see bro?
These shorts have self-pants.
I don't have any underwear.  The men have
seen everything, they know everything, Salih.
Neither do i.
Son, it's not easy to get out of the mafia.
Upholsterer Numan Usta said.
They also gave me a banana peel.
I couldn't have eaten this banana while I was
sleeping.  So what happened to this banana?  Ha?
They want dirty things to come to our minds.
No such thing.
They are playing mind games on us.
So how do you get out of the mafia?
What were the conditions?
They left a note under the toy train.
“You will meet with İsmet brother
at 09.00 tomorrow morning.”
What kind of business have you
gotten into, son?  Who is Ismet brother?
Big boss bro.  Big head.
I mean, he owns the company.
We have been inside for 6 years, we saw his face
for the first time today.  We wouldn't have seen it.
Hello.
Hulusi.  Are you ok?
Where are you going?
Konya, brother.  The men put
us on the intercity bus and left.
Once we opened our eyes, we passed Izmit.
Go back, go back, go back.
No no.
The change of weather will be good for us.
We'll come back tomorrow.
Not him, but the bastards who took their seats
from the side of the corridor to all of us.
There is no one sitting by the window.
And bro, it was left unfinished.
I hope for the goodness that will come from you...
Don't swear, baby.
They also sent our spoon team away.
Gürkan, let's go out now
and follow our destiny.
Just let's change our clothes.
-Where the hell is the banana?
-How should I know, son?
How do I know?
Where is this banana?
I hope I ate it, Gürkan.
Oh God, I hope so.
No bananas.
Gürkan, there was one
of these bananas, right?
No, if there are two, the
other one doesn't have a shell.
Ya.
Oh, what can I say?
Are we going to tell Aunt Naz that
we couldn't get out of the mafia?
Don't say it, son.
Don't make the girl uneasy for no reason.
Everything will be taken care of.
Be comfortable.  Relax, relax.
Brother, I am relaxed about Naz, but
your mother-in-law is a little distressed.
He's right too, son, this is the first
time they want his daughter.  Is it easy?
The guy has officially distanced himself.  If
only they had put us a little further away.
Sir, “Did you find it on the street?”  As they
say, yes, I found these children on the street.
The old organizers were
obsessed with these and ran away.
He left it lying there and I took ownership of it.
Both of their fathers were heavy
alcoholics and addicted to gambling.
They also buried their wives from cancer.
Well, the woman who tidies up the house, of course.
Well, when the woman left,
they couldn't stand it long either.
The last one died last year.
They had no money to pay for their funerals.
Thank God, we buried those works for free.
Of course it was swollen from waiting.
He barely fit into the coffin.
The cover was left slightly unfinished.
Like a Fairy Chimney.  Oh, oh.
The day he died, I had a fight
with my father on the phone.
We broke up upset.
There can be no child like me!
Sir, if you say they are relatives,
they are all as good as each other.
They have an uncle who is a multi-millionaire.
They went to ask for a job,
and the man had his car washed.
He put 10 liras in his pockets.
“My nephews, thank God you are here.
"If I had had it washed outside,
I would have paid more."  said.
Well, that's how people become rich.
What useless people we are!
We are of no use.
All because of us.
If we were men, this wouldn't happen, Salih.
Dear Bünyamin Bey...
...you turned the seer's house into the house
of the dead.  Please don't do it, we are bad.
Look, as you can see, my dear cousin...
...he will die out of grief!
I calculated all of these.
“Why did this guy come when there were parents?”
If they say, it's all for precautionary purposes.
It never occurred to us.
We thought they were an important elder.
Mr. Bünyamin, please
do not tell such things.
We've all been very bad.
I think they are using tactics.
They will exploit her emotions and
get the girl cheaply.  Don't get soft.
Lady, just shut up and let me love your eyes.
Anyway, let's take a break.
Everyone got heavier.  Children...
...needs it.
We also have a balcony in the kitchen.
My aunt!
Can I use the sink?
Let me cry a little there.
My aunt came to my mind.
Go.  Come on.
Relax, son.  Go on, go
cry in the sink.  Cry easily.
This place is not foreign.
Sir, they had one old car.
They couldn't find the money
to cover the windows with film.
They covered it with SSK x-ray films.  The
windshield is completely made by Gürkan...
...it was the lung film of his
aunt who died of lung cancer.
Oh, oh.  Of course, now that's what came to
the child's mind when he said cigarettes.
Dear Mr. Bünyamin, let me love your eyes.
Are you asking for a girl for the first time?
Why!  I'm doing just fine.
I too became a bad person.
I'll go and bring the coffee.
Baby, why are you so bad?
I say you don't have a mother-in-law.  Think about it.
If the mother-in-law was a cotton thread and it fell off the
shelf, the bride's brain would be shattered.  Let me say so.
So there is no mother-in-law.  you should be happy
Mr. Bünyamin, I swear you crashed
into our house like a nightmare.
You haven't left this much happiness
in people.  You broke my heart, I swear.
Me?
Even if we don't give the girl away, I have
some savings.  I will help these children.
Give, give, auntie.  Dont bother.  Give.
Here you go dad.
Mom.
Bismillahirahanirahim.
Where are you baby?
Bünyamin plays very personally.
He's worried about showing himself off.
Sorry.  I came out of the sink
and saw an x-ray on the table.
Same as my late aunt's.
How is it the same?  It's my liver film.
The doctor said, “There is nothing wrong.
“You are like a radish.”  he said.
Sir, now that our coffee has
arrived, don't keep me any longer.
Sir, the command of Allah is
with the words of the prophet...
...if you say OK to this...
-...we--
-Stop, stop, stop.
Not now.  You didn't leave
this much happiness in people.
Let's drink our coffee,
come back tomorrow.
We'll talk about that issue later.
It's starting to smell like soil to
my nose.  Where is my prayer rug?
Let me pray Isha.
You have to start somewhere.
Of course, the father is a sensitive man.
Next time I'll take the girl.
It was good, it was good like that.
I also got warm.
I'll bring it to the bag next time.
Thank you very much.
We asked for his daughter, and the
man started praying the same night.
There is truly good in everything.
My son, the man helped us with food.
He stuffed whatever unpackaged pasta, sausage,
etc. he had at home into a bag and handed it to me.
I thought it was garbage,
so I took it to help.
I can't throw these away now.  It's a sin.
He offered me money, my aunt's son.
In the movies, the man offers the boy
money to let his daughter go after him...
...ours is, "Take mine
out to dinner."  He said,
he tried to give me
money, but I didn't take it.
You did well.
How much worse could it be?
Sir, I took that money.
No, no, no.  Now look, the man is out of
his heart, the one who does good has come...
...we should not leave him in his tracks.  Of course.
Why are you worried?  “We are not
giving the girl away.”  They didn't say.
-“We give.”  They didn't say either.
-Yes.  So we're in a draw.
Everything is under my control.  There
is nothing bad.  Thank you very much.
"There is nothing bad."  he says.
Dude, what could be worse?
Selamun aleykum.
How will you go home at night like this?
Don't take a taxi or anything.
It costs money.  Don't waste your money.
Come on, jump in.
I'll take you home.
Is it possible, daddy?
We will go ourselves.
Come on guys, come on.
There is also seat heating.
Don't be proud, come.
He's not a stranger.
Young people, of course they are ashamed.  If
it weren't for you, we would walk to the subway.
“What more could it be?”  Let
the person he loves die the most.
There is worse than worse.  Let's keep our
mouth shut.  Let's be thankful a little bit.
Did you say something guys?
No, my father asked something, my dear cousin.
Is the car diesel?
You see, right?
Even children's questions are poor.
Dont ask.  It's gas powered, but I'm going to have a gas tank installed.
We put the chocolate and
candies you brought into the freezer.
We will take them out on your second visit.
Don't waste your money and buy it again.
No more daddy, what else?
We'll buy it, why shouldn't we?
Gürkan, the incident started to turn into a nightmare.
Be thankful, be thankful a little.
Your house is also quite far away.
On your second visit, call
me before leaving home...
...I will come and get you.
We go to our place together.
So, I don't know
how we will repay you.
We can't pay anyway.  We have no money.
My God, I am so happy.
Thank you God!
Don't look for our days!
Five.
Four.
Fly.
Two.
One.
Four.
Three and a half.
My stature is enough.
Bismillah.
Guys, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
There was a slight delay in the schedule.
A fagot parked his
car in front of the door.
Sit down.
Lad,
Friend, wait, wait, he's bored.
Make this person happy.
My shoulder!  My shoulder!
Did you see what happened?
No, where should we see it?
We just arrived anyway.
We missed it.  What's the matter?
What happened?
Brother.
We didn't see anything.  We need
to get out of the mafia immediately.
I just said what happened?
Just here...
...What happened?
You shot the man.
Who shot?
-Did I shoot you?
-Hee.
This is how you want to leave
a company that works regularly.
I wanted you to notice.
I didn't shoot.  Friend shot.
He's not yet a minor.  He has
two weeks until he turns 18.  Well...
...he stays in bed for two weeks.
Could there be such a gap in the Constitution?
Who told you that?
It's nothing like that.
That friend has quite a bed.
Oh really?  Dolphin?
Let the simit maker think of it.
That's not my problem.
Bro, how not, let me eat the burr from your eye.
You gave the gun to the man
and said, "Shoot."  you said.
Lalalalala, when did he say it?
Why didn't I hear about it?
“Make your friend happy.”  said.
Don't lie, speak the truth!
Look at the psychopath baby.
He didn't say okay, but you
shot him because he wanted to.
Who said that?
There is violence in me,
brother, I love shooting people!
By the way, I lied, I am 27 years old.
I shot him completely of my own volition.
Don't worry about me being of legal
age, brother, I have a report.  I am crazy.
My friend, İsmet Bey gave you the gun.
My friend, is it a crime to give a gun as a gift?
Do I have to sell it and
invoice for it to be legal?
Once you say that, the case will be dropped there and then.
Also, I do not think
that the court will make a
decision saying "producing
weapons is a crime".
Reason?
“Satan has until
Judgment Day.”  they said.
There are a lot of people here, he
shot one of them at his own discretion.
How do I know you're going to hit this?
Ha?  Is Yunus a lie?
Exactly bro.
The man has a gun in his hand.
Could he have shot me too?  Is it a lie?
God damn it!
It hit my appendix, I'm
glad I didn't have it removed.
Young man, how many bullets are left in the gun?
I would like to point out that
my father, just as he shot me...
...may also shoot others.
That is his right.
He can also shoot instrumentalists.
Are you going to get us shot?
My friend, you scratched your
own itch and got yourself shot.
-Why are you doing this to us?
-I got burned, so do you!
I'm doing my due diligence.
So I'm speaking publicly...
Damn it!  I can if I want.
Come on.
But I do not want.
Why?
Gürkan, they have really
given up on us.  Late.
I had the right not to want it.
I will use that too!
In fact, I'm going to go and eat
half a loaf of döner kebab now.  Why?
Because I want to.  As I want...
...there are foods that are good for me in doner
kebab.  Brother, I need your daily protein...
...since I cannot respond,
my body sends a signal, a
contact is made there,
and the cycle is completed...
...and with the impulse my nervous
system creates in the cerebral cortex...
...I think my dear wanted doner.
But even if I eat more than necessary...
...this time the excess energy
is stored as fat in the body.
You gain weight, what happens?
However, if you burn energy according to the
amount of calories you consume, especially...
...running is an
activity that burns a lot
of ATP, you can easily
control your weight.
So, I have to run so that I can
eat as much kebab as I want.
Fuck!  I got smarter.
What are you looking at?  I came to my senses.
Yes.
Now what conclusion do we
draw from this experience?
So, friend, you will not go down
the well with the rope of a madman!
That's all they say.
Yes guys, where were we?
Yes, gentlemen, why should I let you
go?  With short and concise sentences.
You start.
Now sir, we are
performing.  We are artists.
So we are of no use to you.
Six years ago you took
on a truck destruction job.
Yes sir.  Don't get me wrong, it sounds like
bragging, but we couldn't do that either.
True, true.
The man you destroyed hit
the jackpot in Bulgaria that year.
They made headlines about the man.
Damn Bulgarian baby, damn Bulgarian baby.
We saved so many lives, we took them out and said,
"Oh, this is your share."  He didn't say that!
Does he say?  What a shame, that guy.
He bought protection service with half of his money.
-AA?
-Yay.
We went to save money,
they beat us like that...
...we returned to our country
in ambulances as a convoy.
Of course we were ashamed, we
couldn't tell anyone.  Even to you...
Don't say it anyway, my emperor.
We can't even keep secrets.
Broad beans do not get wet in our mouth.
We are pure damage, aren't we?
It looks like we haven't
taught you anything in six years.
Is it okay, my king?  You are very
successful, but we cannot be educated.
Ah, the kangal puppy, or us.
You tell me, Salih, I learned
to read and write by cheating.
Exactly, President.
I am the man who brought Maltepe
cigarettes to the Local Goods Week.
-Wow?
-One carton.
What is education for me, sir?
My late father tried to force
me to study, but it didn't work.
Sir, my father was a
true lover of education.
My father was a complete enemy of education.
He was against my reading.
I studied with my own means.
I deceived my father by saying
I was working in the industry.
Until I got into university.
I ran to my father, "Dad."  I
said, "I nailed the university."
“Don't be happy, he wasn't
paying.”  said my father.
I couldn't get completely sober.  What do
you mean, duke, when you say he doesn't pay?
“I got it.”  When he said
that, he thought the university
was something like a
six-packer.  Never heard of it.
Anyway, I saw that my father's problem was money, I
didn't go to university, I got involved in these things.
If my father were a man...
...today, I was
Physics Teacher İsmet.
I had two months of vacation in the summer.  Mis.
Does your father know that you are in this business?
Why are you asking?  Are you going
to complain about me to my father?
Why are you asking?
Ha?  Are you going to complain about him to his father?
Is it okay, President?
I was wondering
if he knew how
proud he was of a son.
I thought so too, I
went and told my father.
If I hadn't told him, he would have disowned me.
He didn't ban him, he fired him.
“You have been my child for so many years.  "If
I ban you, you won't get compensation."  said...
...he calculated, gave a lump sum
of money and sent it from home.
You are absolutely
right, we don't mind.
“If a daughter comes between father and son,
she becomes a widow.”  There is a saying:
What kind of talk is that?  Who said that?
-Upholsterer Numan Usta.
-Is he an upholsterer?
What does he understand?
God, why do they belittle
upholstery so much?
What is it to you my friend?
I exchange a few words with the man.
Maybe he knows something.
Here you go, Mr. wagon, you have the floor.
Yes, gentlemen, you have been with us for
six years, you have not had any incidents.
So, if I let you go now...
...you go straight to the
police, tell everything about me...
...and nothing will happen
to either of you.  Is it true?
Wrong.
Lie, slander.  We won't go to the police so
that the bread and musaf will be spoiled.
Are we such people?
He lives for human dignity.
Whoever he is, fuck him.
Who said?
Damn, I took notes, notes.
“The broad bean does not get wet in our mouth.  We can't
keep secrets.  “We sing.”  As he said, this is one eyebrow.
I am silly.  It was a trap question, I didn't know.
I didn't ask a question,
you just said it yourself.
Howl!
I need to make sure you don't go to the police.
This evening, we will take the stage
at the wedding hall at this address...
...you will kidnap the wedding officer
there and bring him directly to me.
Immediately.
Be careful, the man may be guarded.
So you too will have
a secret with me.
After that you are free.
Now fuck off.
Huh?  What did he say?
“Fuck you.”  he said.
The man kidnaps not the bride or
the groom, but the wedding officer.
No Such Thing.
This guy is actually being a jerk.
Why is this man being protected, huh?
Brother Bünyamin, we were
not in a position to object.
İsmet Bey said do it, we will do it.
My friend, leave the halva alone.
I'm explaining the plan, listen.
Be sober.  Now look.
The wedding starts at seven.
The wedding officiant's job
may or may not take half an hour.
As soon as he went out, he
approached behind him like a fox...
...the electromagnetic
shock device we gave you...
...that's how you support a man.
He faints with a thud.  Don't let
the image deceive you.  It doesn't die.
Hulusi, you know, how is the tool?
Number ten bro.
I was not conscious for 45 minutes.
Bring it back to your consciousness now.
I'm telling you the plan.
Gee.  Listen.
Friends, the truck we bought from Upholsterer
Numan Usta is standing in front of the door.
However, there are three security
cameras leading up to the truck.
Hah, that's the camera,
I say. What will we
do if my aunt's son
takes pictures of ours?
Isn't it?  I'm a property, I couldn't think of this.
I made a tape, son, for the cameras, tape.
You are the king.
Anyway, after you throw the baby
into the truck, you will hit the road.
We will come to you after handing
over the stage to the other artist friend.
Who will be on stage after you?
Hande Yener will appear.  Later,
Gökhan will invite Sezer to the stage.
My darling baby.
Come to your senses, it's okay.
I'm telling you something important, son.
Okay, the plan is simple, man.
Whatever, we'll handle it.
-Wow?
-Heh.
Look at the lions.
I swear I had tears in my eyes.
We called, you came immediately.  Team--
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If you can't handle it, the man is a
civil servant, he will find you in no time.
Know what I mean?
So kidnapping like that...
...pointing a device at a civil
servant etc., these are major crimes.
If you talk or sing, they will skewer you.
Let me tell you.
What did we see?
I am not guilty of anything.
He always had these done.
Brother Bünyamin, what's happening to you?
Oh my God, did we ask anything from you...
...you immediately get pumped up.
Hulusi, look at the door.
Don't tell me anything else.
I know a lot.
I can't carry it anymore, okay.
Let me go.
Brother, is there anyone holding you?  First
of all, no one knows why you are here.
Don't panic.  Just be in front
of Naz's door at nine o'clock.
Your issue is a girl issue.
Brother, the neighbors smelled the
halva and saw a lot of shoes at the door...
...they thought there was a
funeral, so they sent us food.
Look, divine sign.
The call to prayer is recited five times a day,
and one does not go to prayer as a divine sign...
...the god immediately signaled that
a pot of food had arrived at the door.
Leave these society babe mouths aside.
Damn, where did you find halva?
Where did it come from?
Man, this thing, I stopped by the
house on my way back to Konya...
...my father, I wish you a lifetime.
But when you call, it is.
Hey, Kadri...
...you can return home if you want.
No bro, we are a team.
-Then you continue with the plan.
-Please.
Now, you should be able to get in and
out of anywhere but not attract attention.
That's why camouflage is very important.
What are you doing?
Hello.
You are the wedding photographer, you are my pride.
Hulusi.
You are your camera, you are my honor.
-Kadri.
-My brother.
My condolences, you are a waiter.
You are also a wedding busker.  Me too.
HE.
PREPARATION
Yes sir, “May God make
you happy.”  we say.
We give the wallet to the bride.
You can kiss the bride.
<I was alone my darling again last night>
<I always thought of you> <I always remembered you>
-What are you doing?
-What should we do, brother?  Same.
Friends, he asked you too.
If you answer, don't be rude.
Sir, since we never
expected this question...
...stating that we were caught unprepared,
I leave the floor to my friend Kadri.
-Kadri.
-Well, my father died yesterday.
My pain is great.
My condolences.
-Amine.
-Amine.
Gullu.
Get.
Do you want a tip?
Get.  Take this, break it among yourselves.
Why did this man give money to our babies?
Pray for those on this stage.
I have never seen such
a performance in my life.
Consider his alms.
40 lira.  We literally robbed a man.
We stole all the money from the pocket
of the man we were going to kidnap.
We became crime machines.
Youth.  It would be a shame.  Watch
out for naphtha.  As soon as you go out...
...let's put the baby down.
Walk.
Dude, the man is not leaving.
It's recording us.
Officially collecting evidence.  We're done.
Nah, we're old enough to want girls.  It turns out,
this guy won't leave until the wedding is over.
He already gave money to our people.
There is a conspiracy, a conspiracy.
Son, aren't these
our transporters?
They're bringing us to the counter, son.
Brother İsmet finished us.
The incident started to turn into a nightmare.
Dishonest people with sailor knots.
The rope does not break.
Should thieves eat stones?  Should he eat stones?
Squeeze that girl.  Compress.  It doesn't break.
Look...
...if we were not conscientious people...
...you will place the hand like this, you will
close the sofa bed, the wrist will be severed.
After that, you will
take the pouch and go...
...we are thieves who stole halal milk.
It doesn't suit us.  You understand?
You are a great man, President.
Nobody knows your value.
Yes, he doesn't know.
<You have many brothers in this
world> <Sand in the sea, waves in us>
<We'll fix it, no problem>
<Don't worry, it'll be okay, bro>
Damn man, look who our guys
added to the team.  Movers.
They also put the wedding officer on
the sofa bed.  There are these, these.
These are stupid idiots.
<Even if we don't turn the
corner> <We don't lose the joy>
<We didn't have anything.>
<Don't worry, it'll be okay, bro>
<Sir, we will continue
our performance><in five minutes>
<Thank you, thank you.>
Gurkan.
Why did he tell us to wait?
Who knows who this guy is looking for?
The man is playing with us
like a cat plays with a mouse.
He won't even touch it.
It will scare us and kill us.
-What are you doing?
-What should I do, Gürkan, I'm looking for our people.
Maybe they will answer
my phone calls so
that we can be
informed and enlightened.
My God, my aunt's child, I still can't
understand it.  I don't understand.
What was in that sofa bed?  What are transporters
doing here?  What is the Kaşık team up to?
-Friends, can you take a look?
-Here you go, officer.
Nope, I'm not saying that.
We received a notice.
They kidnapped the girl who was
carrying her bag of gold in a wedding hall.
I understand now...
...why you came.
How do we know, Officer?
We are musicians.
What was the name of the
wedding hall you were looking at?
-Not Once, Every Night.
-This is it, yes.
Yes, this is it.
How beautiful.  Devrem,
come on, come on, this is it.
<-Is that there?> -Oh, those
bastards also stole the sign.
<-Isn't there a sign?>
-No one should go out.
Do something too, put
your hand where I can see it.
Now go and get dressed,
we will go to the police station.
-Okay, sir.
-Walk.
Sir, God's command, in the words
of the Prophet, if
you say OK to this...
Wait, stop, what are you doing?
The kids haven't arrived yet.
Oh, yes.
I'm done.
Where are these?
We need to ask you that.
Children's work has been delayed.
Let's wait a bit.  They will search anyway.
Thank you for your understanding.
Very sorry, thank you.
Can I ask for the wifi password?
It's written there, under the lamp, on the paper.
Thanks a lot.
We are in the kitchen, sir.
Wifi password Naz_1990
Dad, I congratulate you.
The location of the house is great.
You can see all the
neighbors' internet.  Wonderful.
Just tell the neighbors not
to give their names to the wifi.
Thanks, it's safe.
Moonlight is unlimited.
Automatically connect to Hasibe.
Longing, insecure and cryptic.
It's literally exhibitionism.
-What does he say about me?
-Sir, bound and safe.
Exactly.  Man lives for his chastity.
Very sorry, thank you.
After receiving notice that the person carrying
it along with the jewelry had been kidnapped...
...who was found to be
trying to escape and acting
suspiciously when he
arrived at the scene...
...the officers on duty against
the person or persons have
fulfilled the requirements of
the legislation by taking action.
Let's break this sentence into its elements.
Item?
Commissioner, we don't understand words.
Why did you abolish normal torture?
We will suffer greatly.
Aren't we humans?
Don't we have rights?
It is our right to be beaten, too. How
will we prove that we are innocent?
Son, don't you have a lawyer?
We haven't seen it yet.  We never got married.
We won't be able to get married at this rate.
Commissioner, a girl is wanted
in my absence right now...
...If you allow me, let me
at least make a phone call to
my father-in-law and say,
"I can't come."  Let me say.
You used your telephone right
joker by calling Döşemeci Numan Usta.
But we didn't know he was here.
We've been searching for a while.
-That doesn't count.
-Doesn't it count?
See, Master Numan
says, look, it doesn't count.
They also set rules.
I give them life imprisonment.
Does that happen?
Do we not go to court because
we do not have a lawyer?
Gürkan, the system has changed a lot, Gürkan.
Commissioner, for God's sake, beat us.
Look, we deserved it.
-Beat, beat, beat.
-Beat us.
-I swear, beat me.
-Please beat us.
Repentance is astaghfirullah.
Do you hear, Master Numan?
The man begs, "Beat us."  saying.
Children should at least send a message.
Come on, act like a big brother, come on.
What happens?  At least an SMS.
I'm actually asking because
I'm curious about the ending...
...I won't tell the children.
Will you give the
girl away now or not?
Look, I won't tell
anyone, I swore.
Say it in my ear.
There is no such thing.
Look at your phone, maybe it's the kids.
* <Brother, we can't come this evening, things are getting too long.>
<We'll go another day.>
I need to make a phone call.
With your permission.
Dad, has Bünyamin gone?
I did not understand.  “I will talk
on the phone.”  he said and left.
Who will he meet?
I guess he's important.
Money will definitely talk.
As for us, poor literature.
He's looking for me.
What's wrong, Bünyamin?
-Selamun aleykum.
-Aleykum hello.
Dad, our kids
can't come tonight.
* <They had something very urgent to do.>
I was so ashamed.
I couldn't say it to your face...
...I thought I'd tell you on the phone.
Okay dear, the human condition.
See you later.
The children couldn't come.
He informs him.
I wonder if something happened to them?
Where do we have that chance?
-Mom.
-Shush.
Bünyamin, why did you come?
What kind of talk is that?
There were some things
I couldn't say face to face.
I told him on the phone, I came.
That's different, that's different.
Is it possible to suddenly get up
and leave while being a guest?  Rude.
We'll drink our
tea, then I'll go.
Come, Naz, let's pour the tea.
Thank you, Merci.
After drinking our tea...
...later...
...will you drive me home or
should I walk to the subway?
Come on, we drink tea all the time.
Get up, get up, get up.
Get up, don't be lazy.  Come on brother, get up.
Well come on babosh.
Look, look, look.
They also steal Numan Usta's truck.
The unlucky ones even found the key.
Oh, they steal the sign too.
They left the girl on the sofa
bed to another wedding hall.
They're really kidding.
-These are things...
-Do you know them?
I'll handle it, relax.
They're a gang, sir.
At the last wedding, they
cornered us and demanded money.
It's like they want their own money.
I'm relieved.  Well done Gurkan.  And I said,
“How do I know these?”  I was going to say.
You reminded me well.
These are mental infantry.
They don't know how to cleanse themselves.
First of all, there is no light on their
faces.  These babies are enemies of society.
Apparently they are organized, sir.
Look how many people.
They took the truck and stole the sofa bed.
They put cellophane over the security camera...
...which is a very smart move, a
move that smells of experience.
Who knows how many robberies they committed?
These are dishonorable,
they are dishonorable, sir.
You can leave after reading
and signing your statement.
Look at me, go to bed, get
up and pray to Master Numan.
Of course, of course, we have it.
Behey, who knows where they are now?
Semih.
Kismet means something like this.
La brother, how did we get here?
We realized that...
...silence comes from confession.
No matter what happens to
break this silence, it triggers stress.
Semih.
Close the door.
Brothers, we need to
explain something to you.
Surely we experienced a
connection of clairvoyance.
Otherwise, we know, the people of Istanbul
will steal, the people of Ankara will collapse.
One for you, one for us.
One for you...
...one for us.
You go on.
No, brother, you go ahead.
He was fine.  I will never divide.
One for us, one for you...
...then just us again?
Yes, number 10.
Shh.
Came.  He came, Gürkan, he came.
This guy surpassed the wet, long-haired
girl with no visible face in horror movies.
I am so afraid.
-Are you talking about Tamara?
-Yes.
Dude, how do you watch movies like that?
I don't understand the movie
from reading Nas - Felak.
Should we talk about
this right here, Gürkan?
Son, let's go back inside
and explain everything.
Ismet, the mafia, every-- He's coming.
It's coming.  I swear he's coming.
Throw stones, Gürkan, throw stones.
At least it didn't work, spit it out.
I'm a 30 year old man.
Should I also show my penis?
Guys, we have things to talk about.
But it doesn't happen that way.
Yes, young people.
Wow, you seem to be eating well.
Coming to the topic,
my name is Samet.
So who am I?
You are the wedding officiant.
I'm not an ordinary wedding officiant.  Yes,
I go to weddings, I perform weddings...
...but he also listens to musicians,
hunts down talented ones...
...I make stars out of them.
For example, I discovered Tarkan.
Did you discover Tarkan?
<I discovered it before I discovered it,><pimp Metin was
also at the wedding.>
<The young boy was distracted before me.>
However, I discovered it 10 seconds ago.
<Then he gave me the microphone and left.>
What is your name?
-Gurkan.
-Tarkan.  Gürkan - Tarkan.
Both of them end in "blood".
Tonight could be the night my
country's music
scene changes forever.
Tonight could be that night.
But this is not possible with compositions.  It is
necessary to compose a few compositions like a man.
Dear brother, we already
have our own composition.
-Original.
-Holy crap?
Is he ready too?
Come on, make me listen to your song.
-But we don't have it with us.
-Take it away.
Take me to your song
I'm a mess.
Let me go and wash my hands and face.
Give the account here.
My aunt's son said he discovered
that huge baby and it was a lie.
-“I will make a star.”  said.
-He said yes.
Gürkan - Tarkan, he said.
He said money, he said fame.
-Did he say?
-He said, he said.
“I won't let you out of
limousines, I won't take
you out of jacuzzis.”
said.  Didn't he say?
Then, "Model girls will follow
you too."  He said, didn't he?
Said.
"Her mother will give Naz
to Salih after begging."  said.
-"Lots of money will flow."  He said, didn't he?
-He said, he said.
WTF?  Is that parsley?
He said, but if this big
baby is a talent scout...
...Why did İsmet make us miss this?
Gürkan: “He may be protected.”  he said.
But such is the case with the enemy.
Is this real?
At first I thought it was a coaster.
What a colorful
sexual life people have.
What can be done with it?
Son, don't go through the guy's wallet.
We use one size smaller as a
garbage bag at home, uncle's son.
It has poles, baby.
Like a battery, plus and minus.
This means it can be installed incorrectly.
Is that what's happening?
Speaking of wearing it, I remembered it,
Gürkan.  What will we say to baby İsmet?
Yummy, yummy.
Well done guys, bravo.  Great.
Well, Yunus, you said 17 guards were too many.
Look, they finished a
two-hour job in 10 minutes.
Yes doctor, what do you say?  Did it look like
anything or did it happen?  What are you saying?
Are you crazy Ismet...
...Gentleman?  It doesn't happen like that.  This business
has a board, it has ethics, hospital conditions...
What about doctor, are you going
to have me build a hospital here?
Just make do with the operating room.
Where is my family?
I can't tell you, it would spoil the surprise.
Do you realize what you want from me?
I can't do my job again.
What if something happens during the operation?
No way, no way, Doctor.
How many people are as good as you at this?
There is Mr. Oral.  Dr.
Mr. Oral.  He is a sweet man.
It is also light-handed and
can be done in two minutes.
You take it.  You take it.
Doctor.
From whom will you receive the kidney?  That's
why we need to look at tissue compatibility.
We handle that job, you
mind your own business.
Well, Yunus, since we have a doctor, let's
take a blood pressure measurement, right?
It is customary.
Let's take a look at the kids.
Let's ask how they are doing.
Get on the megaphone.
Doctor, I am this athletic even
though I only have one kidney.
I wonder if it would be
better to have two kidneys...
...or would it weigh you down?
Brother İsmet
Brother Ismet is calling.
We can't take the man to Ismet, son.
The opportunity has come to us.
As Upholsterer Numan
Usta said, if you have a
dream, don't give
up.  It's okay, it's okay.
Why should I leave you alone, Gürkan?
Don't I want to be a star?
Don't I want my light to shine?
Why did that baby Ismet make
our son kidnap the wedding officer?
-Samet.
-Did he make you miss it?
Brother, don't ask.
We didn't get the chance to
tell you, but we missed you.
But we forgot to inform.
Manage it.
It's not clear from your
position, but you are our hostage.
Is that Ismet?
Give me the phone.
Give it to me, son.
Why don't you give it?  Pardon.
* <-Hello, İsmet.> -Hello.
İsmet, "Leave after
me."  Didn't I say?
Fuck.
<* I'll shit in your mouth and nose,> <just
in case you get away with seeing my ass...>
...I don't, you know that, right?
Mom.
My son, stay away from these
children or I will multiply you.
I will pass through you.
I called Salih.  Isn't he there?
Don't fuck Salih.
Yes, yes, that is important.
Let's pay attention to him.
We came here to eat dry rice, what a shame.
Where the hell are you?  Send your location.
* <You won't come to your senses until
you get a slap or two.  Location skipped.>
Or why am I coming?
Position it.
Hello.  Look at me, baby Ismet.
Shut the hell up.  Write, write,
write an address.  Brothers Restaurant.
* <Take your team and come.>
Beauty looks at a pimple,
wealth looks at a spark.
Donkey colt.
-What are you doing?
-Come on.
However, you cursed
his father, it wasn't nice.
Would you like it if they
cursed your parents?
-It won't go.  I am sorry.
-Don't forget.
What the hell is this guy doing?
They did not position.
Small 11, large 19.
Yunus, you know.
-What did you measure it with?
-Blood pressure sir.
Ha, don't scare me son.
Doctor, you wait here,
don't go anywhere.
Do we know their houses?
Go ahead!  We are going.
Look, I'm hitting with my fist, but I'm getting
the power from the shoulder, have you noticed?
Otherwise, it's just hard on the wrist.
You will know the technique.
It's easy once you know the technique.
May the whole world be sacrificed
for those wrists of yours, my father.
They heard it and hid, huh.
Find these dogs.  Disperse.
Yunus, Yunus.
-Brother.
-Dolphin.
Brother.
Damn, one of you checked the wallet, right?
“We checked your wallet.”  Say
that and I'll burn this place down.
You checked your wallet, didn't you?
Dolphin.
Yes bro?
17 guards are too many.
Just fire 10 of them.
<And the rest...>
...let them wait in the warehouse.  They
slow down our work.  Send them away.
Okey brother.
Of course they're not here.
They are hiding, but where are they hiding?
LEVEL ORGANIZATION
<To Hemzemin Organization...>
...welcome..
Nobody can find us here.  It is the
safest place in Istanbul right now.
When brother Bünyamin took over this
place from brother Nihat, the security...
...to increase it, he spent money
and changed the core of the door lock.
He also gave us a key.
So he loves us.
Son, what's the matter with me from the corner of the door?
Listen to your song.  Where is the work?
Work.
-Hello, brother Bünyamin.
-Ha?
<CD of our song...>
...well, I looked at him.
I'm in the office too.
My baby is somewhere on the table.
Take a good look.
Gurkan.
Desktop.
<-No?> -No, no.
Brother Bünyamin, I'm sorry, we
couldn't come to ask for Naz this evening.
Things happened to us.
No problem.  I handled that job.
-What did you fix?
<-While we're at it...>
...now I thought it wouldn't be like he went to
sit down, I asked for the girl, in her absence.
Did they give?
No, they didn't.
<But I picked up the father.>
Father lowered the sails.
Dad is in my palm.
<You mind your own business now.>
Don't worry about such things.
<* We'll go again.>
<Now, daddy, my mouth...>
...looks inside,
wondering what to say.
* <It's naive.>
Thank you, Merci.
My dear, let me get off at a suitable place.
Guys, history is being made tonight.
A star is born.
Why do I keep crying? Am
I pregnant or something?
What we should do when the
Ready Metin bastard is not around...
...Calling Metin bastard,
because he knows this job best.
I've been calling since the evening,
Axle doesn't answer the phone.
Brother İsmet
Is that Ismet?
-Open Open.
-Brother.
Hungry.
-Salih.
-Yes, brother İsmet.
Huh.  Look who's with me.
Just explain your situation.
Salih, they are kidnapping me.
Brother Bünyamin.
<Give me how much money.>
Don't spare money.
My soul is very sweet,
and my curse is fulfilled.
* <You crawl from version to version.>
Give them whatever they want.
Thank you, Merci.
* <We will
exchange.><In exchange for Bünyamin...>
...wedding officer.
The cruel baby kidnapped brother Bünyamin.
-"Give Samet, take Bünyamin."  said.
-Okay, say.
-Brother.
-Say okay.
-Gurkan.
-Give it to me.
Hello, baby Ismet.
* <Whoever fears you should
be like you.> <Position, my son.>
Hello, your voice is dead.
Hello, inaudible, hello.
Where are you?  Where are you son?
* <Say a place, say a place.>
Less from less becomes more from more.
I spit in your mold.
<Don't shout!  My business with you...>
...over--
Did the bird shit?
Buy lottery tickets now.
<-What was I saying?> -You were
saying, "When I'm done with you," brother.
Hah, tie you two end to end and--
What the hell is this at night?
What is this, son?
-Dolphin?
-Apache.
Sorry brother İsmet, I can't hear you.
Damn babies.
Go ahead, go!
I hear it now.  Yeah, duh.
What was I saying?
You said, "Tie you end to
end" and stood there, brother.
Hah, I tied it up, then I took that
hot skewer and let one of you see--
Anyway, you got it.
Come to the repair shop.
We'll be there in 45 minutes.
<Just an hour.>
<We're a bit far away.>
We are further away.
Okay, we'll be there in an hour.
Close.
Go, go, go.
Go, go.
Go ahead!  Damn axle.
Look at these babies, they
put films on the windows...
...it is not clear whether
they are being drugged
inside, engaged in prostitution,
or murdering people.
There's prostitution, babies.
Look at the axle.
Brother, look, they put black films on
the windows.  These are definitely big men.
You can't get into them.
Don't interfere with anything.
We'll handle everything, brother.
We are Ankara babies, we
are dirty on the inside, right?
We are the uncanny types.
We are also street children.
-I will take their minds soon.
-What will you do?
I'll do the cigarette trick.
Mom, I'm burning.
I'm out of saliva, Gürkan.  My saliva has
run out, it hasn't gone out, it's burning.
Do something.
What the hell is “tuh”?  If you had blown it, it would
have passed, son.  Why are you spitting in my mouth?
Damn man, you said you ran
out of saliva, so I supplemented.
Water extinguishes fire, so go with that logic.
Soil extinguishes fire, so you
could fuck me with that logic.
-Then I will be happy.
-Son, that's what you do for me.
Send the hostage.
Keep the engine on.
Come.
You broke my beautiful car, you broke it.
Take this, put it in the back.
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
Is this your new car?
You changed the car so we
wouldn't recognize it, but...
Oh man, "Good luck."  he says.
How heavy was his slap?  Remove it.
This is how they kill a man, this is how.
Where the hell?
Don't squeeze, don't squeeze.  Squeezing.
Beware.
I need it alive.
What is slapping?
What are you doing?
Yes, brother Samet, look,
you got me pumped up too.
Don't get me involved, son.
I'll get off at a suitable place.
-Oh, I have to live.
-Don't cry.
Son, I set out on this path.
I will not die without making
someone a star in this three-day world.
Pick up the phone Metin, pick up.
Boy, what's going on?
Who is this guy?
How do you know me?
I do not know you.
Did men you don't know save you?
Did you say it to me, sir?
Oh man, this will be over tonight.
Pick up the phone Metin, pick up.
Open up, the new Tarkan is coming.
Should we go after them, brother?  We will catch up.
Uh-uh.  They will come to me on their own feet.
We go to their mother.
Both of their mothers are deceased, brother.
Don't do it.
Rest in peace.
Amine.
Then, father, uncle, aunt, brother-in-law,
sister, anyone, any close relative...
...we find it tonight.
Are they all dead?
Are you making me have a conscience, son?  Ha?
Are they both orphans,
orphans and homeless?
Can you mess with these guys?
Don't get me wrong bro...
...there are many
such men around me.
For them, their friends are everything.
They see him as a brother.
Let's go to the neighborhood
where they live and find their friends.
Well done Cemal.
We are going to their neighborhoods.
Let's ask the grocer and the
jackal who their best friend is.
-It's stuck.
-My aunt's son...
...this, Samet brother, seems like a bit of an exaggeration.
So this is the new Tarkan or something...
Did he see the gem in us?
Well, your Tarkan brand is a bit assertive...
...I don't know, Murat Boz,
you didn't know, Kerem Cem...
-...even Kubat.
- I like İbrahim Erkal.
Kiss my head, my guard.
No.  Metin brother does not pick up the phone.
Something bad must have happened to
him, otherwise he would have opened it.
Damn, we left it empty one night,
I wonder if it discovered someone?
Look at me, you
don't have a contract
or an agreement
with anyone, do you?
-Exit.
-I burned my tongue once.
Exit.
-Is there anyone after you?
-Exit.
-Acun may be after us.
-Baby, why are you saying this?
Damn man, why shouldn't I tell you?
You sing like a nightingale.
He will know everything.
Isn't it the right to know?
-To explain.
-What Acun?
You haven't mentioned this before.  To explain.
Brother, we were going to participate
in the O Ses Türkiye competition.
We filled out the wrong form and
entered the Survivor pre-qualifications.
-Did we pass?
-Oh dad, la.
We almost raced.
That football player baby, İbrahim Yattara.
We saw it a short distance away and then we
realized that it was not a music competition.
I saw Yılmaz Morgül, brother.
How should we know?
Then he said, “I'm sorry,
brother, there was a mistake.
“We will not be able to compete.”  When you say...
...that baby was a girl to us.
He said, “I will finish you.”  said.
“We haven't even started yet,
where are you finishing it?”  I said.
“Call us when you're done, uncle.”  I said.
“We are just sobering up.”
He has been dealing with us since that day.
He does his best.
Don't talk nonsense.
Why should Acun bother with you?
Then why doesn't TV8
broadcast in our house?  He did.
Did the man climb onto your roof
and turn the direction of your antenna?
My God.  This turned out to be blind and ignorant.
Why should the man do it himself, bro?
He sends others.
Isn't there any Alp Kırşan baby,
Burcu Esmersoy?  He makes them do it.
Your situation is very dire.
Exactly my partner.  You caught us.
What a terrible thing.
It doesn't open.  It doesn't open.
There's nothing can be done.
We will go to Metin brother's house.
This will end tonight.
Get in the car.
We're going to Metin brothers', brother.
-Good good.
-Is it good?
Who were you talking with?
There's nothing wrong, right?
No, nothing.
I called the police and told them everything.
Here I told you about
brother İsmet, kidnapping etc.
They didn't believe it.
So it's okay, let's go.
Look, look, look.
My son is calling again.
This guy calls me more than my girlfriend.
You think you're my ex-girlfriend.
Hello İsmet, what's wrong?
What's wrong honey, what's going on?
Salih, look who's with me.
Your best friend.
<What kind of friend?>
Wow dude, what's up?
My son, they kidnapped me for you.
Can you believe it, look at the friendship, whoa.
Gokmen.  This time they kidnapped the
grocery store because they were our friends.
Grocery store?
What kind of a mess did I get myself into?
All because of my greed for money.
Uncle, you panicked a little.
Look, calm down, let me love your eyes.
Hello Gokmen.
Where are you son?  You're okay, aren't
you?  They didn't do anything, did they?
No no.  They haven't done anything yet.
This place has turned into an operating room.
I heard them talking,
they were saying kidney etc.
* <I think they will remove my kidney, but it doesn't matter.>
Isn't friendship
necessary for these days?
Don't talk nonsense baby.
What kidney?
This has nothing to do with you, son.
You're not even our close
friend.  Salih said it on credit.
<I understand.>
You say that so that nothing
will happen to me, but...
<-...we are friends, coach.>
<-Yes, that's enough chatting.>
Bring me my trust,
take your friend.
An hour later in the same place.
He says let's swap Gökmen and Samet.
Ulan Salih, you prevented us
from becoming famous for a penny.
Money is sweet, of course dear, the kid is right.
Look at the baby,
you have big moves.
-What?
-What the hell?
-What the hell?
-Who is greedy for money, what the hell am I?
I won't let our precious elder brother Samet eat for
the sake of the grocery store baby with shit in his ass.
If you have to give
someone else, give Bünyamin.
Wow.
Wow, gentlemen.
Buy.  Sell ​​me, buy me.
Drink raki.
Look, this uncle was very scared.
He says raki maki.  This...
...so what does it have to do with it?
Hush, hush.  Shut up.
One two three.
Damn Ismet.
We cannot come there for Gökmen.
<He's not our close friend or anything.>
Let the baby go.
No swap or scissors, come on.
* <Come on.  Go away.>
At least they didn't take the baby's kidney.
Nothing happens.
It's between me and Ismet.
Of course, it's a matter between him
and her.  It has nothing to do with me.
Oh my God, what will Ismet do with me?
Why give me?
Give Bünyamin away, no.
Let Samet go.
He already wants it.
Why are you giving me away?
Why are you giving me away?
Gee.
Don't be famous.
Money isn't everything, son.
I have lived long enough
to make this sentence.
Wow.
Despite everything...
...thank you, Mersi.
Young people, be careful about this.
This is gone.
Come come.
The same thing happens again.
What an unfortunate man I am.
The whole music market is here.
What happened bro?
I came here the night
I discovered Tarkan...
...and what should I see, tons
of shoes in front of the door.
He had gathered the entire music market.
The same thing happens.
Of course he doesn't answer my phone.
Did this guy find a piece of crap?
Why is this man crying?
Metin discovered the folk singer.
Get off.
Salih, the man does not understand
the situation.  Bro, it's not like that.
Was that the imam?
He came to Yasin and left.
Wow, Yasin was recited, the sacrifice was made...
...rice with meat everywhere.
Of course, it's your day.
Who is Samet?
Brother, won't you understand the
situation without seeing Münker and Nekir?
Don't you see, they have funerals.
Of course, money blinds
people.  What should he do?
Metin brother.
Metin brother.
-Is what I heard true, brother?
-That's right, Samet.
Sit down.
We lost my brother.
Finally.  I thought something bad had
happened when you didn't answer the phone.
What comes to one's mind, what?
If we are not offended, there is no problem.
“My condolences.”  What he means is,
brother Metin.  We came as soon as we heard.
Brother Samet is still in shock.
Thank you for coming.
Bro, I have the new Tarkan thing.
It can't be done without you bro.
These are lies.
We are here today...
...we are not there tomorrow.
Bro, are you upset about something?
Is there something you are hiding from me, brother?
-The man is sitting with a wide-eyed face.
-Man: "I have a funeral."  says.
Can such a thing happen?  My brother
Metin is one of the most famous artists...
...he is the man who brought her
to the stage the day her mother died.
My brother Metin is a professional.
We're at the funeral home, Samet.
Let me love your eyes, don't do it.
Bro, you are serious.
I didn't know, brother,
you were really upset.
You must have been close.
I say brother.
So you loved it that much.
Brother, let's go to the next room and
let our children whisper the song to you.
-In a low voice.
-Samet.
It is not like the old one.  You give
the money, the album is recorded...
...clips, posters, we
package them all together.
People are discovering it now.
Our revolution is over.
We returned to the factory.
Bro, it's a shame to ask, how much is this?
One hundred fifty thousand dollars.
Get up Gürkan, let's go, let's
apologize to brother İsmet immediately.
Okay, if it's money.
I find this money and come.
-You're here, aren't you?
-Of course I'm here, where should I go?
Look, brother Samet.
I guess you didn't understand.
“I have a funeral.”  I say.
Go ahead!
Guys, you go.  I'm staying.
It would be a shame if we all left together now.
Brother Metin needs me.
Brother, for God's sake, I am a
man you do not know.  Let's go.
Leave it alone.  Let it stay.
Uncle, stand over Metin.
Don't let him do anything.
I expect everything from this man.
All these funerals, funerals,
everything could be a lie.
So I shouldn't trust the man
who stole Tarkan from me.
Come on, see you bro.
He wants money, dishonest.
When I said "new Tarkan", he got jealous.
He'll keep me busy while he's thinking.
Am I going to eat?
Well, sir, he also had a funeral.
Take a lesson then, pimp.
This world does not belong to anyone!
Brother Samet, look, the door and window are open.
Don't let them hear it.  If only you calmed down a bit.
Brother, what an ambitious man you are.
A dragon literally came out of it.
It'll happen this time, man.
Solve this money issue, the rest is easy.
Solve it?
No one said, "I'm solving it."
So "I'm solving it."  said.
His accent has changed.
Because the other one would be more ridiculous.
I burned the ships.
From now on, whatever I say will happen.
Take out your phone.
Bro, I consider them my friends...
..my dear friend, I knew.
Well, come, come.  Oh my dear.
Which shampoo do you use?
Salih is calling.  So they gave up.
Where is the grocery store?  Did you attack?
No bro, he's outside.
He didn't leave, he's crying.
It was destroyed, strange.
He thought they were his best friends.
Call, Yunus.
Call him and come immediately.  Call.
Oh my dear.
Walk.
Go! Go! Go.
Hello, Salih.  How quickly did you give up?
Look at me, let me just say from the beginning
that we messed up the grocery store a bit.
Damn brother İsmet, just shut up,
shut up, let go of this Gökmen baby...
* <...we told you, my lion,>
<he is not our friend or anything.>
He is the person from whom I buy soap every day.
We deceived the money so that we wouldn't pay
it on credit.  I will be short and concise.
Look who's with us.  Listen.
Hello, İsmet.  I'm samet.
* <The boys kidnapped me>
The terms are clear and concise.
Bring 170 thousand dollars...
<-...take me.> -It was 150
thousand dollars, brother.
We'll eat twenty of them, son.
We crush it in celebration.
number 10.
It's a lot of money, I can't find it at this hour.
We'll withdraw it tomorrow when the banks open.
Where is the venue?
Where should I come?
-What is he saying?
-Where should we do our shopping?
-Where will be crowded at 09.00 in the morning?
-Even shopping malls are closed at that time.
So, is there a safer
place than here?
This is the funeral of a tycoon.
There are a ton of people in there.
It will be even more crowded
tomorrow morning.  I think this is it.
Live long.
-I'm positioning.
-Of course, of course, post a location, leave a trace.
Come with the money tomorrow
morning and let's do the shopping.
I keep myself on my nerves.
-You deserve it, son.
-You're right, I was spoiled.
The money corrupted me before it even arrived.
Take this, Yunus.  They will position.
We will be there tomorrow morning.
Send this poor man home too.
What are you looking at, son?
Take a walk.
What are you pushing, President?
We are going.
Don't talk about it in the evening.
What happened to this?
Brother Samet, I swear you are a great man.
If it were up to us, we would
definitely go to our house,
Just because Ismet can't
think of that place, right?
Hell, you're a weird guy too.
Saying he can't think of it...
...you didn't bring us to
Ismet's house, did you?
Guys, this is my father's house.
İsmet doesn't even know the way here.
Don't worry, we are safe.
Guys, have a good sleep tonight.
We have very important work tomorrow.
Dude, where is the number 100?
I should wash my hands and face.
Go down, turn right, three meters ahead.
It's my father's house.
We come once a month, once a year.
Damn.
The deceased was a good man but also
a difficult man.  He had strange habits.
He didn't want me to read it at all.
I went to high school secretly from this.
On the other hand, I worked in the
industry and earned my own money.
When I got into university,
I went to this and said:
“Dad, dad.  “I nailed the university.”
-“How much money did he pay?”  said.
-Ganyan thinks it's a university, right?
This is old times, old fathers are always the same.
In fact, just yesterday, brother
İsmet told a similar story.
Damn.
How did I fall into trouble, friend?
Brother, did you really bring
us to brother İsmet's house?
You are not being joked about either.
Damn baby, what a joke, shut up.
Not like that.
These are brothers, Gürkan.
Hey, Ismet is my brother.
Why are you so surprised?
“Why are you surprised?”  What do you mean
brother?  The man is trying to kidnap you.
Hey, this is new too.  He saw that I
was not going and started sending his men.
After a while, I recognized the men, I
slapped the person and sent them back.
Then he found you.
Thank God he found you.
My dreams came true.
Brother Samet, you should have told me.
Those slaps and stuff.
Because you're his brother.
Heh, I thought you understood.
Samet, İsmet.
At vowels, same.
"You're not that stupid," I said.
Is that all?
I'm sorry, but why do you
underestimate our stupidity, brother?
Why is this man making you kidnap?
What's wrong with you?  It's between me and Ismet.
Come on, go to bed and sleep.
We have very important things to do tomorrow.
Come on.
Young people, may God give comfort.
Damn auntie's son, they turned
out to be brothers, it's a lie.
The man made us kidnap
him to steal his brother's kidney.
Well, as Upholsterer
Numan Usta said.
There's shit inside people, son.
Everything is expected from him.
Son, what a carefree baby you are.
He fell asleep as soon as he fell over.
Get up, get up.  Get up.
-Are we there yet?
-Oh, we are here, we are in Aşti.
Come on, help me with the luggage,
it won't be a shame for the assistant.
Don't go, don't go.  Where are you going?
Where are you going with the baby in your hand?
Gee.
What are you experiencing, son?
Don't scare me.  We are in Sametgil.
Give me that baby too.
Minister.
Let's make some money?
I knew you'd come back one day.
Old friend.
We are friends, aren't we, brother?
We are friends.
But you still call me President.
Peerarchy is very important.
We are closed due to the funeral.  Condolences...
...it will be accepted at
Artists Site No 18A Gebze.
Auntie's son, what the hell is this?
Brother, we are closed.  Door--
-Was it you?
-Brother, what's going on here?
Don't ask, lots of people came.
We could not meet alone with Metin brother.
I hung a sign on the door, I
am sending everyone to Gebze.
Still, I couldn't sit down for two
minutes without opening the door.
One cannot have so
many relatives, brother.
The deceased has six children.  Oh no.
I didn't let any of them in.  “If you
had come while your father was still alive.
"Why are you coming when you're dead?"  I said.
Inside there are those who came before us.
And Ismet has just arrived.
-Brother?
-What?
Did you sabotage the funeral home?
You're not good.  You're not well, brother.
Can you please
only do what we say?
You are needed by us.
The head is gone.
<There is an
outhouse outside.><It can also be seen from the window.>
<Send your man
there with the money>
<then I will send brother Bünyamin.>
<When brother Bünyamin comes back with the
money> <you can take your brother and leave.>
<Oh, so you know that he is my brother.>
<Brother, let's use the group for business purposes only.>
I thought I had a thousand
friends, but where are they?
None of them came to offer their condolences.
That man has been here since night.
Yasin read until the morning.
He did everything we could do.
He took care of the funeral.
He is my blood brother now.
Thank you, Merci.
The deceased had six children.
Where are they?
None of them even showed up.
They did not come to his living body, so they came to his dead body.
They are ungrateful.
He is really right.
<Watch your back, your back.>
Come.  Come.
Be very careful.  Come.
Damn, brother Bünyamin.
Moneys.
They're stealing my sofa bed.
Obviously they need it.
Let's not get bored on a day like this.
-They are stealing our future.  Our dreams--
-If you don't misunderstand, brother...
...I'll buy you a sofa bed too.
I'll even buy a sofa set.
We are friends now.
And a true friend.
Damn it, 170 thousand dollars is gone.
Whoa!  Is it worth that much?
No dear, it's all just a sofa bed, huh?
-Run!
-Wait!
170 thousand dollars, right?
Property is the chip of life.
My brother is a retired commissioner.
He takes care.
Don't move.
How many friends do I have
here in my difficult times?
Will I tire you?
Sit down.
We are not anyone's
friend or friend, brother.
-The money is gone.
-He left, I swear he went.
Anyway, let's look at the bright side.
We can't live with this pain much longer.
Ismet will kill us immediately.
Samet.
Come.
Okey brother.
Young people, come together.
My son is a bride.
Now this Metin's...
...one of the artists he manages appeared
on television half an hour later...
...she was going to sing on
live broadcast.  He got sick.
He says, "If" he says,
"if you can make it"...
"It's yours" he says, "Let Yeni Tarkan
come out and sing the song live."  says.
What did you say?
"It's right there on the canal anyway.
Even if we run, we can make it.
"We even protect her pussy."
I said.  Run, run!
Where to?
We need to leave immediately.
My condolences.
-My condolences.
-Thank you.
My condolences.
In this era, you must choose
your friends carefully, President.
Since you're not
my friend, you know.
Hell, I don't even have this car washed
with a sponge to avoid scratches...
...I'm catching water from afar.
What happened to the car?
You dried up our stove, our stove.
Psycho baby.
My aunt's son, what did you say?
If you have a dream, pursue it.
Is it possible?  Run!  Run.
Run!
It was a steel cant.
Youth.
You go, I'm coming.
-Brother Samet!
-Run Gürkan, run.
-He was going to call them, that's what he said.
-Did he say so?
-He said so.
-He said fine.
Whoop, whoop, whoop, stop it.
Are you going to take a tour?
What are you saying, crazy baby?
Mind your business.
You were chasing, you caught him.
How much faster are you getting?
What the hell is this baby saying?
We are not chasing you.
Who are you chasing?
We're not chasing
anyone, they're chasing us.
Who are they?
Are these again?
What did you do bro, look,
these guys are nasty bastards.
Damn, you are such a chatterbox.  Run!
Why should I run away?
What does it have to do with me?
There were four people, four people.
Catch it!
My God, what a beautiful day, I
found the answers to all my questions.
Dear God, glory to heaven.  Run, run.
My son, run, run.
Are you tired?
The canal is around that corner.
Walk!
We came, we came.
Don't come, son, the road has gone to shit.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
He's about to come off dialysis.
They will bring it soon.
Don't talk nonsense around the man.
You made the dialysis
patient run around all night.
My precious brother
İsmet, the light of my eyes...
-...let me explain-- -Like
skipping stones in the sea...
...but you were making me say the swear words on the phone.
Have we become the light of your eyes now?  Ha?
That's why face-to-face communication is very important, brother.
Misunderstandings can happen over the phone.
We really didn't know that
brother Samet was a dialysis patient.
When you had your brother kidnapped, we thought
you were going to steal his kidney by force.
But how do we know that you will
force him to have a kidney transplant?
What evil have you seen so
far that made you think like this?
Thinking?
It's not in our nature, brother.
Brother Samet said so.
“Ismet,” he said, “will steal my kidney with
his metastasia.  "Don't give me to him."  said.
He deceived us.  He said so.
That's what he said.
Is that what I told you?
-Brother.
-Don't get involved.
Let him get involved.
Did I say that, my kidney?
He didn't say.
He said, but he didn't say it face to face.  If he said
it on the phone, there could be a misunderstanding.
If we understand that issue, there is no problem.
Look at me İsmet, these
are not children who will lie.
What did you say to scare them?
Brother, if stones rain down on your head, you will know it from me.
You just got out of dialysis,
look at what you're dealing with.
What did the doctor tell you?
"Take it easy."  said.
"Take care of yourself."  said.
Brother, why are you resisting?
Come to me.
Let me get this kidney transplant done.
You're not on the transplant list either, bro.
“Donation work has become widespread
in our country,” says the doctor.
Never lose hope in God.
It's time to come.
I didn't care about living but...
...these children gave
me new life energy, İsmet.
These?
Heh.
I found the new Tarkan, İsmet.
Now I have a reason to live.
I will be added to the list.
Brother, my operation is ready.
Say yes, let's do the transplant now.
I'm keeping the doctor waiting in the warehouse, brother.
No way, son, not with those poor people.
But well, not for money...
...if someone gives his kidney
because he really loves him...
...but there will be zero money involved.
Just love and respect.
They put it to the board, and if
the board says okay, it's done.
Someone very close to me.
Of course.  Of course.
Especially when you
have a brother like Ismet.
This disease is hereditary in us.
İsmet does not have a single kidney either.
huh?  huh?
That's not what I meant when I said
brother.  You know, you meet someone...
...your blood will warm up so you can
remember brother.  Someone very close to you.
Abo.
Don't I have a friend like that?
There is and there is.
I'm in.
Who the hell is this?
I'll give it to you, brother.  Ha?
Let me give it to you.  I already
understood, there are two of these kidneys.
Am I going to put the second one in my ass?
I've come to my senses now.  A smart man would
donate his kidney without even thinking, right?
-Is that possible?
-It happens, it happens.
Come here, let me see, come.
Come come come.
Is it okay bro?
It's okay.
Yes.  That's it.  This happened.
Thank God, the new
Tarkan is coming.
- Brother İsmet.
-Why?
It's a shame to ask, are
we out of the mafia now?
You're out!
Since Bünyamin couldn't manage it, I appreciated
you coming with the wedding officer...
...but I'm afraid that this one
will turn out to be like Bünyamin.
That's why he shouldn't want the girl.
But sir, should he want the
girl while the elder one is there?
Or should you make your little one ask for it?
Can such a thing happen?
I will do the talking,
I want the girl.
Are you going to ask me for your own daughter?
Is there such a thing in our history?
Don't prolong it.
Sir, as you all know, our
daughter and son met and met...
...they loved each other and
eventually decided to get married.
What happens to us family elders in this situation?
Shit food falls down.
Put us in our place
and confront us...
...“Dad, I have a loved
one.”  Does anyone say?  No.
“How is our financial situation?
I want to get married."  Did anyone say?
Where?
Since you haven't taken
us for granted until now...
...why do you ask our
opinion when you want the girl?
See what you're up to.
I was going to say it when you came last time...
...I was a little angry then...
...but over time I got to know you and loved you.
Sir, I was just about
to mention that.
Wait, unibrow.
Don't worry, I'm doing well.
Salih.  You are not young.
You are not beautiful at all.
You don't have any money.
What can i say...
...you...
...you're just like me.
I was like that too when I was your age.
I have known both poverty and wealth.
They're both shitty things.
The richest person is the one who does not need money.
May God not leave you in need of honor.
Amine.
You grow old in a pillow.
Be happy throughout Omer.
Well, I couldn't move from
the previous feeling to this one...
...I stayed in the part where I had dinner.
What happened man?  What happened,
aunt's son?  Did they give the girl away?
The broadcast went out too, I
couldn't watch it.  Do you suffer from it?
Gurkan.  Gurkan.
May God make him happy.
A decision taken by majority
vote, not unanimously.
The mother-in-law's face is still Merkel.
Then should I
make another coffee?
I spoke my mind.
Salih may be a good person...
...but he has neither a
permanent job nor savings.
The child doesn't even have SSK.
Although I said he was a child, this is the man you know.
There's a big age difference.
I don't want to embarrass you, but...
Sir, I have never been
ashamed of anything in my life.
I have always been content with what was given to me...
...May the one who gives them to me
be pleased with me when the day comes.
First of all, I wanted to be a family
with your child, and therefore with you...
...but if you don't find
it worthy, we don't mind.
I mentioned this about your daughter before:
If your family doesn't want
me, I will never upset them.
This issue is over for me.
Sorry dad.
You are truly a father man.
The girl's father is from us.  We officially have
a man inside, but we still couldn't get the girl.
I wish you could call me and do this artistry
tomorrow, son.  What will happen now?
What are we going to do?
Dad won't take us home.
You have never recognized me.
Never.
You are truly a father man.  Halal.
I wanted my own
daughter for you.
It wasn't enough, I also gave it away.
You didn't get it!
Dad, my mother doesn't have the heart yet.
But I already figured out
how to convince my mother.
It's a shame to say it, we'll be
stars soon.  Our tape is coming out.
After that, he will be convinced.
I think it was a good thing.
Exactly my partner, let the
legend of Salih and Gürkan begin...
...later we come back and ask again.
So what, are we in a hurry?
This duo will overshadow even Tarkan.
If you don't believe us, ask brother Samet.
Brother Samet, tell me.
Tell me.
Binary?
Guys, let's talk about this issue.
Sir, pull to the right, let's get off here.
Let's get down, let's get down.
Young people, there is no double mikili.
What have I been telling you for days?
New star, new Tarkan, it's over.
There is no double michile.  I need Gurkan.
Brother, can such a thing happen?
Let me eat the burr from your eye.
This baby has been with me since
he was born.  We set out as a duo.
If I thought you were a couple,
why would I allow this man to marry?
Can a star man get married?
The man still couldn't get over the situation.
Go ahead, get up and let's go.
What is it sir...
...I will be famous and
leave my brother behind, huh?
Go ahead and go!
Get up, get up.  Get up.
Go, go, go.
Go play at weddings.
Break records for playing at weddings.
I'm saying I'm going to make the guy a star.
Tarkan!
He has the money, he has the fame, he has the luxury.
And there's the music too.
The man makes his tapes as he
wishes now.  There is no one involved.
If only he would come, burp loudly,
and lay the infrastructure underneath...
...here's a summer hit.
Nobody said, "Brother, what did you
eat before coming here?"  He cannot ask.
-He doesn't ask.
-Impossible.
Gürkan, you can think about it if you want.
You know me.  I don't mind.
Look, this is going to make a lot of money.
He'll buy you a house too.
Won't you take it, you ungrateful one?
I get.
Youth.
Look, even now we're wasting time.
There's still work to be done.
You will study dance in France for one month
and language education in London for two months.
In due time, we will go on tour for two years.
Or we will be separated for a long time.
No way.
Salih.
For God's sake, say something.
Look, this guy is going to be a star, right
now you're stopping him from doing so.
Brother Samet is telling the truth, my son.
Would it be bad if at
least one of us was saved?
Besides...
...you won't forget me.
I don't forget.
If I need anything,
you come to my aid.
<Like doves waiting for spring>
<Wait for me too, don't forget>
<Your hands in the air, your eyes on the road>
<Don't forget God and me>
<You kept ringing in my ears>
<If you remember, yesterday a very famous><from the warehouse
of the furniture company>
<exactly 1200 sofa beds were stolen.>
<Criminal machine gang who describe
themselves by the name "Sofabeds"> <
<...took the blame.>
<Security is on alert.>
<As you know, these are not sofa beds>
<they use the space
inside> as a chest.>
<We are expecting a big hit.>
<They rob the country with 1200 sofa beds>
Everybody left, damn it.
<-How many were the thieves?>
<-I don't know.  We are investigating.>
<Like doves waiting for spring>
<Wait for me too> <Don't forget>
<Your hands in the air>
<Your eyes on the road>
Best wishes to your health, Gürkan Effendi.  You are my pride.
<Don't forget>
<You kept ringing in my ears>
<You are the tears flowing down my cheeks>
<You became a song on my lips>
<I kept saying your name>
<You became a song on my lips>
<I kept saying your name>
You started without me again, didn't you?
You couldn't hold yourself for two minutes.
You're late, I started
too, son, what should I do?
Just good luck.  You were not
lazy, you went and got the melon.
Any news?  Did Aunt Naz call?
Don't ever bring up that subject.
They fixed the girl on bill payment
days so that she could be of some use...
...when we go to ask for the
girl, bills come to their mind...
...they make the payment.
They set us up like an alarm, Gürkan.
You were going to take the girl when they gave her to her.
-You've been an artist for a fact.
-I trusted baby Samet, my son.
I'm pumped.
Brother Samet doesn't give up either.
He keeps checking me.  He keeps checking.
He sent a message the other day.
"Have a good Friday.  “It's still not
too late to start a solo career.”  said.
-What did you say?
-“Today is Wednesday.”  I said.
No matter how high the baby
is, he has confused the days.
He's looking for me, he's drunk and drunk.
Would you like to leave him alone, son of a aunt?
Damn son, where are you leaving me?
You know, you wouldn't trade what you
set out for for what you found on the road?
My son, I know my way and my friend.
You relax.
My dear, look, we are men who have not renewed
their lease even once in this mortal world.
Which one is this?
Maybe we would have our own house.
What if you had a house, son?  Are
you going to plant onions in your garden?
How many hours do we spend at home?
What will happen, Salih?
Let me love your eyes, let me go.
Let those feet go, baby.
Are you satisfied with this life?
You're saying this to console me, I know.
Are you satisfied with this life?
May you not have the chance to see Gürkan, who
spoke to you to console you, in the morning.
Don't drink that crap.
This is ruining you.
What do you mean, are you satisfied?
So, it means "Come on, we are offering."  If
they say, you will leave me and leave me.
Baby, look, don't make any big moves,
I'll beat your mouth to the ground.
Where was I going?
Does the meat separate from the nail, dog?
“I wouldn't go.”  So you say.
Reason?  Or are you satisfied with this life?
Of course I agree, son.
More than this poor house...
...than my ripped jeans...
...from the secluded
wedding halls we played in...
...most of all...
...from you, brother.
You are being rude.
You left me with
nothing to say, baby.
I am the man who
refused to be Tarkan today.
Damn son, his father wanted his own
daughter for me, but I didn't take him.
You can't compete with me,
I'm the biggest horseshoe.
You say that right.
You're saying that right.
Wow.
We had so many dreams.
What did they promise?
...which one is here now?
Zero to zero...
...we have it, the two of us.
The two of us.
Are you cold?
Should I bring something for your back?
Should I shake you?
There's no need.  I cry.
Salih, you are a man like his daughter.
Damn man, this conversation is not about
making you cry, this is about making you laugh.
We couldn't get anyone to listen to our song.
Come on, let's play,
let's play by ourselves.
-Get up, play.
-No more.
-Get up.
-No way.
-Get up.
-Well, nope.
Get up, son.
Baby: My dad said let them
come next week and ask again.
A message came from Naz.
He says his father told them to
come again next week and ask again.
We want it son, what will happen?  We would
like to go again.  Will it stick to our hands?
Get up, let's play, get up.
Where did you learn the move?
Was your father also a köçek?
-My aunt's child.
-Huh?
We will want that girl until we die.
What do you mean until death?
Until his mother died.  Don't stay like
that, don't say you didn't think about it.
Would it be bad if we buried our mother-in-law?
All troubles would be over.
There really is a murderer inside
you, you know that, right Salih?
Go crazy.  Go crazy.
Go crazy.
Go crazy.  Go crazy, Salih.
<Everyone goes to Mersin>
<We go on the contrary>
<Everyone goes to Mersin>
<We go on the contrary>
<You are
smart, but><It doesn't work>
