Today there is only darkness around
me nothing else
And l am the one responsible
for this darkness
But l can see one thing clearly
in this dark
What l have ruined
Only l can fix it nobody else
And tonight l will have to
do the same....
l don't know that will be my
victory or defeat
l don't even know that l will be
alive or l will have to die
that's why before leaving
l want to share my secret
with you
That secret what didn't started
from me
but it was started from Shanaya
Today l have come to you
Because tomorrow is an award function
My name is also include for
nomination for the best actress
And l must have to win that
Few new comers actress are
leaving behind me
And l want to defeat them
That's the last chance for me
l know....
l know everything
Whatever you told me till today
Everything was true
l believe in you from my heart
l do whatever you say....
So tell me where do l put
my head
What l should ask for....
Which stone l should wear....
what would fulfill my wish....
Why you are so upset?
God is with you.....
So why you are afraid?
You will must get that award
Your name is written on that
That's not my wish but
it's a God's wish
And until tomorrow's dawn
didn't appear
Don't take it off....
Just keep watching....
You will must get the award
First time l am getting award
for a movie
for whom l didn't work really hard
And l have come to realize that
only those movies are successful
what has been made with heart
not with the mind
From last many years many actresses
would have been won this award
Winners might change....
sometimes they won it over and
over again
and tonight
who is sitting around us
she is surrounded by her own silence
So she could hear her own name
You don't mind
lt's not your defeat
lt's your God's losing
Tushar!
Yes!
l was your employee
But l am still loyal to you
What do you want to say?
When God get defeat
So you should go to some
other force
And that force is undefeatable
l can take you over there
lf you want....
That's my number
For you!
So much pain
Anger....
Don't be silly!
Just for an award
That was my award
That was my right
l am being defeated from that
junior actress
She is snatching my place slowly
This world's door are opened
for everyone
Nobody can stop anyont to
become successful
And why do you hate Sanjana?
She is just another actress whose
time is with her
Whose movies are running
People like her
And l thought you came here for me
Come out from this world
From which stardom your
heart get broken
You will have to suffer so much pain
You should better forget it
Amazing!
Success didn't left me
and you gave me the advice
for get married
l can't through my stardom
l can't destroy it with my marriage
l have hidden this relationship
from three years
So l shouldn't be defammed
My life, my happiness
everything is my carrier
And me?
My phone is on....
And l came out from there
But she will go so far with
her anger
Nor l knew....
Nor she....
This man lives in this slums...
Yes!
You go and meet him
What do you mean?
You are not coming?
No!
My limit ends here
Don't be amazed Shanaya
lt's just a temple
What l have covered
like other temples of these slums...
Because this place is mine
Not a God's place
And only those people came here
who are refused by God
l am that person who you
are looking for....
Let's go!
Your mom has endured lot of pains
She tried to commit suicide
Twice!
She could not die....
She was wearing a ring in
her right hand's middle finger
Lord Durga Locket in her neck what
she never took off...
Temple in house....
She was lying there all day long
And one day when you came from
the school....
How do you know that?
Even my close friends doesn't
know that....
Because l am not human but a spirit
Somewhere in the middle of
earth and sky
We can make her sick with
Black Magic
We can make her disable
We can ruin her face
Even we can kill her
What do you want to do with Sanjana
That's the name of that girl
She is the reason of your visit
Yes!
She is the reason
She gave me lot of pain
She made me jealous alot
And l want to return all
these pains to her
But not to kill her
But to make her upset
Whatever you want to do
with her
You do it....
But my wish must come true
She must be finish
And she would also know
that how does it feel to lose
when you were about to win
That's it!
l have done Black Magic on this water
This water starts affects when it
mixed up with the blood
After that her soul will be
in my control
l will make her dance like puppet
Whatever will be happen with her
Entire world will see that
You will get everything you want
Remember one thing!
Black Magic effects only for a period
You will have to keep doing that
Until your wish doesn't come true
And that person shouldn't
be a servant
but that must be a trustable man
Do you have any trustable man?
Why l am feeling like?
You let me win intentionally
You know what victory meant for me
So why should l lose from you
May be it will be a victory of a big
game inside of any small game
You know me very well....
Sanjana will be your heroine
Why?
Because l want to destroy her
You will work with her
You will meet her everyday
You will stay close to her
And you will give her poison
What is this nonsense?
l should give her poison and kill her
This poison is not dangerous
She won't die!
But she will must want to die
lt is Black Magic
whose effect is in that water
What you will give her
l didn't understand what are
you saying
Look into my eyes
Can't you see my pain
My sorrow!
My defeat
You can see that
You can see that only you
can help me
You can give me all
what l want....
l don't need anything else
Give me my time back
My success
There is no other way
l am so alone!
l came here for Shanaya
not for Sanjana!
Sanjana is an enemy and Shanaya
is a friend
l came here for that woman
whom l love....
not for that woman who
needed love
Tonight
is your last night
After that nobody will survive
Not even you....
What was yours...
Now it's mine
So tell me
What happened with you that night,
l have told you
That's Mr. Mehra's fault
l don't want to say anything else
You are lying!
You are accusing a decent man
Give her the dialogues!
l am sorry!
Can l just take 5 minutes!
Yeah sure!
What happen?
l don't know
Last night l saw a nightmare
Earlier l thought somebody
is in my house
then suddenly TV has started
on and off
l heard a voice and....
And l don't know what else....
That's it!
Everyone have nightmares....
Why you are so upset?
You go to your room
l will send you special coffee
l have got news that Sanjana is
forgetting her dialogues
she can't complete her scene
lt's not like that...
She is not feeling well
lt's not about her condition
lt is the effect of those drops what
you gave her yesterday
What are you doing?
Few more days
Few more drops
For me!
This is very stupid!
lf you love me
You can be stupid for me
Your costume is ready
We are shooting in Studio 3
l am coming!
Thankyou!
lt's not an illusion
lt's reality
l can see it all
l am feeling it
Do you have any problem in
these days?
Any stress?
Any recent incident?
Like someone's death in
your family
lncidents comes and gone in life
But....
that doesn't make illsuions....
l want to run a test....
Shanaya your black magic is
affecting Sanjana
l have see whatever is happening
with her
What's happening to her?
Tell me every details
Are you insane?
Have you lost your mind?
Why we are doing all this?
What do you want from this girl?
She is decent, alone and her
mom is even died....
Until she was alive her father
didn't live with her
She spend her entire life
without her father
Because she snatched my dad...
Devashi Shekhar was my dad....
And her too
Her mom was my dad's keep
She has taken my mom's place
And then she was born
And then she has taken my place
My right on which dad's love
She got that right from me
When bad time came
He gave my things to her
My clothes!
My shoes!
My happinesses
My childhood!
My career is not my dad what
she will snatch
my fame is not my toys with whom
she will play
And my happinesses are not my shoes
what will fit in her feet
That's why you will do the same
what l want....
What l am saying
l have given you alot
l am your toxication,
l am your habit!
Your career is because of me
l want that price
So tell me
You will have to pay the price
or not
Yes or No!
Look at the smoke carefully!
Did you see something?
No!
Look carefully!
Bad news!
Very bad news!
What Sanjana can see...
We can't see that
lt means
that some spirit has captured
Sanjana's spirit
What?
Whose spirit is that?
We will have to find out
And we will have to go in
that spirit's world
Spirit's world?
ls there any world like that?
Yes!
ln which world we live
They have the same world....
The difference is that
that bodies doesn't live there
only spirits lives there....
Sanjana's spirit is captured
in that world
We will have to release her
But it could be dangerous to anyone
There is no other way?
No!
We can enter to spirit's world
from there...
where life and death present together
Graveyard!
But l can't do this....
l don't have that strength
Rajdev will meet you there
in the middle of night and morning
Who is doing this black magic on you
Sit between these graves....
Until this act doesn't over nobody
will speak
You can go from here
Give me your hand
But for what?
lt will be difficult to find you
in spirit's world
lf l will be attach with you
then it will be lead us to your spirit
And one more thing
Only my spirit will
go that world
but my body will remain here
lf l would been attacked on
that world
that my body will be hert
That's the law....
lf any wound will come to my body
then don't be scared!
Control yourself!
And don't leave this relation
Otherwise this act will be incomplete
And you will never get peace....
l have come to release your spirit
to take it back to your body
But how did this water came here
My spirit...
is captured because of this water
Somebody is using this water
Don't worry!
Once l will take you across this light
Once you'll be release from this world
then you will be back to your world
Help me!
l am opening!
Nothing will happen to you
He will kill me
Listen to me!
l have seen many rascals!
But l have never seen rascal like you
l have brought you from down
to sky
l have made you from assistant
to film director
l gave you position, power
After sleeping with younger sister
You have forgotten elder sister's bed
from your career has been started
Whatever l am just because
of my abilities
not because of your influence
l love her and l will always love her
Because these are the heart relations
and nobody plan them
Only people like you plan them
for their own fun
for your own needs
You gave me shelter for
your own needs
And you are making Sanjana ill
for your own....
You are killing innocent people
for that crown
what you will never have
lt's not true!
That's the truth!
Your time is over
lt's Sanjana's time
You will have to stop this
Black Magic
Because only l am the witness
of this thing
that people died because of you
My one statement can ruin your life
One secret is in your heart
and l also have a secret
what will not spare you
You don't know whom l made
my God....
lt's the strange time
lt has brought me back
from where l have started
my journey
But this time everything is different
Now l don't have happiness
only sadness
Now l don't have crowd
only loneliness...
Get the chair1
You are coming upstairs!
or l come down!
What the hell are you doing here?
What kind of situation is that?
Friends have met the enemies
No problem!
lt happens when you are in love
l also have a sickness
What should l do?
Only you can cure it
lt's wide shot!
but camera is good
When your girlfriend will
watch this dvd
then she will feel very bad
She couldn't tolerate it
that whom she thinks her hero
He is the worst villain of
her life
Take it!
Finish the job what you have taken
And remember!
lf Sanjana will create the scene
on shoot
then l will understand that you
have supported me
And if l will see her happy
then l will understand that
you have supported her
And you know....
that what will l do with
this dvd?
Breakfast for you!
How did l came here?
What kind of place is this?
That's my beach house
Far away from the city
l have kidnapped you....
Kidnap!
Away from the city?
And l didn't know...
lt happens
People who doesn't have
burden on their heart
They sleep like this
l got the advantage and here we are
By the way l got this place to
spend few peacefull moments
But l didn't had any excuse to came
here till yesterday
Today l have got excuse with you,
Really!
And what about the shooting?
l have spoken to producer and
got few days leave
l told him that l like this girl
l want to take her along
Because l will have to
take care of her
So to hell with the movie
You wouldn't have said like that
Not like that....
Sanjana!
l wanna talk to you
Yes!
Speak!
l wanted to talk to you from few days
What's the matter?
But l think you won't understand
And you will leave me
What's the matter?
l...
l have decided to love you like crazy
You have scared me
Look how my heart is beating
you are crazy!
You must know her
Who doesn't know her?
You will stay there
or you will come in
Only few people know one thing
that we both are....
Sisters....
Our moms are different but...
Our dad was a same person
We met like this after many years
Shanaya has brought a dvd
to show us
lt's just a 2 minutes promo
and everything will be over
in 2 minutes
This movie has shots like you
have never seen before
Film director is very talented
l think dvd is empty
l think l have brought
wrong dvd
lt happens....
lt could be a real dvd
You are so stupid
What did you think?
You will save her on this
beach house
And l will never know that you
have brought her here
What do you want?
Tomorrow there is a film
success party
Many famous people will
come there
Film Producer wants to sign
Sanjana for his next movie
And l want you to do
what you have been doing yet
Make her a scene
l have told you....
You will do it
And your love story is in
danger right now....
This accident has her brain
Sanjana can't work in our movie
lt's not her fault
Look!
We need hindi movie actress
Not a pornstar
Here is your signing amount cheque
and contract copy
But l am feeling very guilty
Now what do you want?
you have got what you wanted
Sanjana is my sister
She is sick
l didn't came here to take anything
but to give her
l have brought soup for her
Think!
She came naked in party after
having chocolates
now what she will do after
having this soup
Your condition is worse
because of her
Your fear is because of Black Magic
But how do you know that?
Who is doing this?
Who is that person?
Me!
and Shanaya
She hates you
She wants to destroy you
And l have supported her
For the sake of few needs
She had everything
What l have been greed for
She fullfilled my dreams
She gave me everything
what l needed for....
Now l will do whatever you want
First you both destroyed me
And now you want me to
take decision
But what will happen to decide
Look at me!
l have lost everything
You both have naked me in
front of everyone
Child and dog only needs love
And my dad just loved me
Alot love!
Not Shanaya's share but my
share of love
Today l have known that it's a
sin to love someone
She would have asked me once
l would give my fame to her
and appologize to her
But she never asked me
Not her share of love from dad,
nor her share of fame from me
Go away from here
You can't do anything
There must be a solution to save her
That same way what we
have taken earlier
We'll have to release Sanjana's spirit
from the spirit's world
l will go there
You?
That's not a normal spirit
That's a dangerous spirit
That spirit has killed my student
That won't spare you
ln this act your body and spirit
would be harmed
and you can die as well
l am the only responsible for
Sanjana's condition
l will go there to rescue her
Fine!
lf you are insisting then fine
But this act could be done there
when life and death meets together
We will have to take Sanjana
to Graveyard right now....
l won't give you the permission to
take Sanjana from hospital
No! l am sorry!
Then this act can't be done
There is one solution
What?
Do you have morgue in hospital
Yes!
Why?
That's the place where dead and
alive people met
This act could be done in morgue
Aditya is in morgue
He is going to spirit's world
to save Sanjana
lf Aditya will go there and win
You will have to seperate them
right now
You go!
Once MRl will be done then
l will call you
Close the door
Come!
Before somebody shall come we
should leave
Till morning
Nor you will come here
Nor you will let anyone come here
Now leave!
l will lock the door
We will have to start this act now
You lay down there
You won't kill him
But you can let him away for
few moments
l have come to rescue you
Let's go!
For what?
l have no reason to live
l am your sinner
Nor l am able for your forgiveness
nor your love
But l love you
and l will always love you
And only my God is the
witness of that
And l swear to him
that if my love is not true
then l will die in this world
Go away from here
He will kill you
That spirit has attacked on Aditya...
Nobody can beat me now....
Nobody can see me like this
That's my secret
and it will go with me
l am Shanaya
l was a star
No!
Don't be silly
Don't be silly!
Few people destroyed their lives
for that fame
what has been buried in time's
graveyard one day
They forgot that who has born
with the sand
He will have to bury in sand
lf something remains then
that's our good act
Sacrifice
That's the secret
whose name is life....
