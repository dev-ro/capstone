Studies have shown that
teen sex is
the most searched form of sex
on the internet.
This is not surprising,
because the age at which we find
other people attractive does not change,
instead it expands.
When we are young we find children
over our own age attractive,
but as we grow older,
children under the age of 18
do not become less attractive.
But pedophiles also find children
under the age of 18 attractive.
So what is the difference
between you and pedophiles?
ARE ALL MEN PEDOPHILES?
Here is the deal, think about it.
Being a pedophile is wrong.
More details about
the Canadian man,
who is now at the heart
of a global man hunt.
Including who he is,
his alleged crimes and
how he spends his time
half a world away.
A New York congressman says,
Michael Jackson was a pedophile
who doesn't deserve all
the attention he's getting.
70000 people from 30+
different countries in Europe
are cracking down
on pedophile groups.
In Holland they successfully arrested
a group saving about 230 victims.
The Bishop of this church of
the Archdiocese was forced to resign,
because he had been abusing his
younger nephew for many years.
When is it considered pedophilia?
Under the age of 16, 14, 12?
I think somebody is a pedophile
when he is
attracted to somebody
who is under 18.
The billionaire prime minister faces trial
on charges of paying for sex with
Ruby when she was just 17.
It's a diseased,
psychotic person,
not even a human being.
I don't think it's a human being.
When an adult has sex with a child
it's called 'statutory rape'.
It's not called anything else,
but rape.
Pedophiles are men older than 30
who abuse our children.
Online he calls himself Maybay2004.
He makes a date for sex with the girl
he believes to be 13.
Makes it sound like, you would
do that with a 13-year-old.
No, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that to her.
Unless if she was above 18.
Pedophile is somebody who's older
than 21 and
who feels attracted to
somebody younger than 15.
I think somebody who is 21 goes with
somebody who is 15 or 16.
It's not the best thing,
but if somebody is 30 and
goes with somebody who is
15, I think it's wrong.
It is time now for another chapter
in the taudry tale titled:
'The pope and the pedophile priests'.
Somebody who just likes children.
Pedophile is an older man.
Disgusting.
It's an illness.
Pervert.
Something like priests.
Mentally ill.
Criminal.
Psycho.
Insane.
Crazy.
There is no standard
definition for pedophilia
because the world can't
agree on one definition.
The most confusing factor is
the major difference
in the legal age of consent.
The minimum age at which
a heterosexual person
is considered legal for sexual act
varies from 9 years
to 20 years.
Some countries, such as
Saud Arabia and Oman
do not even have
legal age of consent.
But to fully understand this
we need to go back to the beginning.
We need to go back in time,
to the Stone Age.
THE STONE AGE
Life was not easy in the Stone Age.
The climate was harsh, people had to
work hard to have food on the table.
They had to hunt for wild animals.
Dangerous job.
They had to gather the food,
climb trees to get nuts and seeds.
On top of that there were
all kind of diseases,
that make the average lifespan of
a human being of that period rather low.
Slightly over 30 years of age.
Even worse in the following period.
Period
between the Stone and
Bronze ages, the Neolithic
This period even drops to
as low as 20 years of age only.
So with this very short span of life
it means the early modern humans
did not have the luxury
like we have today
to postpone having babies.
And even though since Stone Age
life expectancy has more than doubled
natural selection results
in early reproduction
because a young age is favourable
to a healthy offspring.
Anthropological studies conducted by
Napoleon Chagnon 'Primitive societies'
suggest that the average man
finds females
around the age of 16 sexually
the most attractive.
Males have an instinctive
preference for females
who are their early age
of sexual maturity.
From the evolutionarily point of view
this makes perfect sense.
A male who can gain sexual access
to a young virgin female
can maximize his own
reproductive potential.
Males who evolved attraction to females,
those who are not yet pregnant
would have more offsprings
than their male competitors.
There has always been a
biological preference
for adolescent children
and young adults.
So as time progressed
certain societies
would take this to the extreme.
ANCIENT TIMES
The word 'pedophilia' is
composed of two Greek words.
On one hand 'pais', which
means child or generally
youthful person,
dependent person even,
and 'philia', which means love,
closeness, being one's own.
So generally could say
it is the love of children or a child.
PEDERASTY
The Greeks and Romans practiced
'pederasty'. And it means that
there was an erotic relationship between
an adolescent boy and older man.
'Pederasty' did not only occur
between men and boys
it was also well-known
between women and girls.
Nonetheless I think
we can safely say that
most people associate with
pederasty relationship
between older men and boys.
Pederasty was not just
widely practiced,
it was also widely
recognized in particular
in ancient Greece
as a very normal
and even commendable
social institution.
It was not odd, it was not wrong.
It was something that was
part of social life more broadly.
Pederasty has existed in many cultures.
The ancient Greek case is, I think
the best known but nonetheless
it was practiced and normal
in many other cultures too.
For instance,
in the Middle East and Asia.
THE CHURCH
If you look at the church
in the middle ages,
if you look at its
view on sexuality
that was quite conservative.
I hadn't always been that way
from the beginning.
Considering the practice of celibacy
that wasn't there
when the church started.
Popes, priests, they had wives
they had children.
It's only when celibacy
was introduced in the middle ages
that it sparked an immense increase of
homosexuality in the church.
A catholic priest who molested
adolescent boys
were not homosexual by nature.
But as you know,
place any men in an environment
that is deprived of women
and what will happen?
You will most likely see
homosexual activity.
Priests, right, they're spiritual.
Yes, but they are human as well.
And as humans they're
sexual beings.
Studies've even shown that
the sexual abuse of children
is not limited
to the catholic church.
Other churches and religions are
just as likely to
abuse children.
The majority of priests who abuse children
can not be diagnosed with true pedophilia
Rather their actions involve 'hebophilia'.
Hebophilia is defined as an attraction
towards adolescent children.
In technical terms they are called
'offending hebophiles'.
If the sex that involves
adolescent children is a moral issue
then why is it common in religion?
Various religions contain
sexual activities with children.
Christianity, Islam and Judaism
are no exception.
Mary was at the age of 12 or 15
when she got her
baby, Jesus Christ.
Ashia was married
with the prophet at 6
and consumated the marriage at 9
Furthermore Bar Mitswa is
when Jewish boys turn 13
and are seen as men.
Jewish girls have Bat Mitswa.
When they turn 12
they are seen as women.
Looking back in history
one can see its sexual pattern.
The average age of pregnancy
was 13 and
only in recent years
has that age gone up,
especially in Western society.
Currently in Western society
the average age of pregnancy is
between 21 and 23.
Interview with a women who had
a relationship with an
adult when she was 13.
When I was 13 years old
I felt in love
with a guy who was 18.
It was love at first sight.
He often came to my house,
because he was a
friend of my brother.
They did some motorcycling
and horse-riding together.
I start to like him more and more
because he was a bit older,
he already worked.
I used to visit his parents
where we used to play
on the pinball machine.
When I put my hands
on the button
he used to stand behind me,
place his hands over
mine and guide me.
He was sweet, cool,
a little bit macho.
My whole family approved
this relationship,
except my dad.
One day we were
kissing in my room
and my dad found out.
He began to shout
'Get out of my house
and never come back.'
My father went to the police
to press charges
against my boyfriend, Willem.
Because I think that
he thought that
what we did was wrong.
I was child and
Willem was an adult,
and I think that was pedophilia
in his eyes.
Despite everything
I still continued our relationship.
One day that was a party
in Willem's house,
his parents invited me.
My dad discovered it
and I went there
and was told, need to
come home directly.
So I went home and
I opened the door
and there was my father.
He was very, very angry.
He had a knife in his hand
and he threatened me.
I was scared and
ran for my life.
I was so scared that I went to
my neighbour and call his parents.
They came to pick me up
and we went to the police.
The next day
my whole family decided
that Willem was never allowed
to come to our house again.
Despite of everything I loved him
and I don't think that
what we did was wrong
or pedophilia.
He is and will always be
my first love.
Overall you can see that,
girls start puberty around age 10
and finish around age 16.
Boys they start puberty
somewhat later and
consequently also finish
the puberty somewhat later.
Western society has chosen 18 as the
legal age at which we become adults.
Dispute of fact that women usually
reach maturity at age 16
the legal age for Western society
is 18.
This was an obvious choice
because at 18 men reach maturity
To fully understand this choice
we must understand
the evolutionary differences
between men and women.
Women have many requirements
for their ideal men.
One of the most valuable requirements
is that their ideal man is tall.
This is not a superficial choice.
Instead this is actually a logical
and instinctive decision.
Back in the Stone Age a simple law
applied; survival of the fittest.
This meant that only
the strongest human survived.
Women preferred men
who are big and tall
Larger men could provide
more food and
better protection
than smaller, weaker men.
Natural selection favored bigger men,
that is why most men
are taller than women.
But this extended growth
came at a price.
In order to become taller
than women,
men needed two years extra
to become taller.
The extra energy put into growing
also affected men's mental growth.
Instead of becoming physically mature
at age 16,
men are physically mature
at age 18,
and also later
in their mental maturity.
Today, if you compare
16 years old girls to boys
you will realize that 16-year-old
girls are sexually
and mentally far more mature
than 16-year-old boys.
Girls even start puberty
earlier than boys
and therefore usually
have sex earlier.
That is why girls are more likely
to want older partners.
Growing up they realize
the boys their own age
lag behind in maturity
and keep this mindset.
That is why the average women
is younger than the male partner.
Biologically human start experimenting
with sexual intercourse in puberty.
This usually begins around
the age of 13.
However Western society has pushed
the legal age of sexuality maturity
several years beyond
the physical age of sexual maturity
and regard sex normal when
humans reach
the legal age of 18.
This choice are not
based on morals instead
this choice is mainly
based on education.
Western society is fortunate enough
to offer most children an education.
High school education
usually ends at age of 18.
That is why Western society
does not favor
underage sex because
it interferes with education.
Due to the increased education the age
of pregnancy has risen in recent years.
But despite the high pregnancy age
and the modern ways of thinking
Western society still has a deep
fascination with underage girls
and nowhere is this
more visible than
in the fashion industry
and the media.
THE FASHION INDUSTRY
I started out as a model
when I was 16 years old.
I joined this modelling
competition.
After the competition
my modelling career
took off and I got
a lot of job offers.
Everything went fine until
I got this special assignment
where I had to entertain
these old Chinese businessmen.
Then I decided to quit
my modelling career.
After the set back I decided
to stay in the fashion industry
and open my own
modelling agency.
I am the head modelling
scout and owner of the
International Modelling
Agency, Chameleon.
I book and scout my models from Brazil,
Russia, Ukraine and the United States.
I book my models for fashion shows,
print ads, catalogs and events.
Many people are worried about increasing
sexuality of the fashion industry.
But what happens in front of
the camera doesn't worry me.
It's what happens
behind the camera.
I've seen a lot of wrong and crazy
things going on in the fashion industry,
where young models
date really old men.
Even major international agencies
are known for these activities.
But luckily not everyone is like that.
The biggest misconception that
most women have about modelling
is that they think modelling is
all about glamor and looking pretty.
They don't know
modelling is a real job.
I noticed that most companies use
celebrities in their late 20s and 30s,
but older celebrities are not models.
The reason why they are
in fashion magazines
and TV commercials is
because of their fame.
If you take away fame I don't think they
would be selected as one of the models.
Because in the industry
they prefer young models.
There is a saying that; 'children wear
make-up to look like adults
and adults wear make-up
to look like children'.
The industry can be tough but
if you get selected as
one of the fashion model,
it is a fairytale dream come true
and secretly every girl
wants to be a princess.
These days everybody
wants to be a fashion model.
The average age at which
high fashion models
start their career is
between 12 and 16.
16 is a special age
because after puberty
most women tend to gain weight.
If a girl has past 18
and still hasn’t been scouted
as a high fashion model,
then it will probably never happen.
There are many critics who complain
about the fashion industry,
but at the end of the day
it's demand and supply.
We give what the people want.
Being a mum is hard at any age.
Believe me I know. But imagine
being a mum twice before the age of 19.
A new study says that's the story
for 1 of 5 teenage girls in America.
I think I was 12 when I first
started thinking about sex.
More shocking still, fully half of girls
between 14 and 19 say they've had sex.
I guess when I was 11 or 12
I was starting think about sex.
Parents out there, there is a worrisome
trend we need to tell you about.
More than 20% of teenagers
admit to sending
naked photos of themselves
to other teens.
I was around 11 when
I started thinking about sex.
...and teens and preteens are engaged
in sexual behavior at much earlier ages.
Between the age of 5 and 7.
I was 7 years old.
Age of 8.
I was 8 or 9.
At age of 11.
At the age of 11.
About 12-13.
I was 11 or 12 when I first
started thinking about sex.
I guess, everybody gasps
When they hear
the 13-year-old say they're
having sex with a 12-year-old.
But I guess we've removed
ourselves from what
the world was like when
we were coming up.
At age 16 most girls are
physically mature,
however that doesn’t mean that
they are mentally ready to have sex
and of course all sex
should be consensual.
Child sexuality is very prominent
in Western media.
The age of 16 is embedded
in our society
because at that age every man knows
that females are sexually mature.
We do not need biology to tell us that
16 year olds are treated in media
as sexual beings.
Just look at MTV, '16 and Pregnant',
'Teen Moms', or 'My Super Sweet 16'.
Or the fact that the average age
of a fashion model is 16.
Western society considers
this behavior normal.
If a girl wants to start a high fashion
modelling career at the age 19
I think that's a little bit too old
for most modelling agencies.
However, not every culture has adopted to
Western views on child sexuality.
Traditional cultures which have had
very little contact with Western ideology
still marry and bear children
in early puberty.
There are also many modern societies
that differ from the West.
In Japanese society the attraction
to young teenage girls
it's a wide spread
cultural phenomenon.
The term 'Lolicon'
("Lolita complex")
describes an attraction
to underage girls
or an individual
with such an attraction.
Lolicon is very popular
in Japanese media and fashion.
Outside Japan lolicon mainly refers
to a genre of Japanese comics
and animations that
the depict girls sexually.
What makes lolicon so controversial
are the art forms; anime and manga.
Lolicon art has no actual age.
Just like the Disney characters
Peter Pan and Tinkerbell.
Nobody knows their real age.
>The attractioned to children can be found
in many societies. But there is a limit.
There is no society in the world
that encourages sex
with children before puberty.
INTERVIEW WITH A VICTIM OF AN
OFFENDING PEDOPHILE.
My abuse started when I was about 5
by my father.
He was never nice.
I have pictures of me as a baby
and him holding me and I'm screaming.
I knew... I knew then that
he wasn't very nice.
I can remember at the first time
that I remember him ever touching me.
He had me in his bed with him
and I thought he was sleeping.
He just reached over and
started touching my chest.
I was shocked and made an excuse for him,
I though it's ok.
He just must have thought
that I was my mum.
But now I think about that and
why would that be
my first thought and not;
'Please stop' or 'Leave me alone'.
I lied there until he was done and
left his bed and went into my own room.
But soon touching wasn't enough and
he moved on to oral sex.
At the time my parents had a waterbed
and he would straddle my little neck
and make me do these awful adult things
and I couldn't understand.
He'd kick me out of bed and tell me,
I'd better not to get sick and I'd
better not to make mess on the carpet.
In the same year those things
were still not enough
and he moved on to actually raping me.
I can remember waking up
with him on top of...
on top of me and my legs were asleep
and my hips hurt and
he was making me hold this cross necklace
so that it didn't make any noise.
All those things happened
almost every night.
I got a break every now and
then when my grandmother
came into town or
he went out of town for business.
My life was doing all these things
that my father wanted.
I became great hiding and learning
how to cover things up.
I can remember sneaking the bloody
underwear to the trash in the morning.
I can still feel the cold ground
under my bare-feet
and I would just hope that
the door wouldn't make anybody...
wouldn't make any noise
and wake anybody up.
The same year our neighbor
started abusing me.
Looking back I think my father
may have known or even set it up.
But at this point I'm not sure that
it matters or I will ever know for sure.
The neighbor had this
big red van
and he was always taking us
somewhere on the weekends
and we were just in that little park.
I was collecting little
tadpoles and having
so much fun. It was
beautiful outside.
He called me over the van and
took off my shorts and
he raped me in the back of
the van on the beanbags.
I can remember looking
out the window,
seeing the beautiful sky
and this huge tree.
Big, beautiful tree
swaying in the breeze
and I couldn't understand why this was
happening on such a beautiful day.
He was done, he told me to get dressed
and he just left.
I put my clothes on and went back to
the table to get my bucket of tadpoles
when he kicked them over
and started stepping on them
saying, that next time
I wouldn't fight.
My entire life I felt guilty that
I couldn't pick them up fast enough
that I couldn't save them.
I didn't care about me
but I couldn't save those tadpoles.
He was... when I think about it,
he was in his early 20s and I was 5.
How much could I really fought him?
Finally, when I myself was in my early
20s I pressed charges against my father.
It was one of the hardest things
I've ever done in my life.
But at least it kept
his step-daughter safe.
He took a plea bargain
but still couldn't follow the rules
so he spent almost a year in jail.
Not near enough for all that
he did to me.
But I didn't do it for me.
I just did it to keep others safe.
I'm trying not to let
my past define me.
Some days I lose but I'm winning
more days than ever.
And soon I'll be ok.
I'll find my way out of this and
be the person that I was meant to be.
WHAT IS PEDOPHILIA?
There is difference between
the general public term of pedophilia
and the professional definition.
The public usually identify pedophilia
with someone
who is sexually attracted to a human being
below the legal age of the majority.
However, the clinical term specifies
the definition as:
"A sexual preference for children, usually
of pre-pubertal or early of pubertal age."
And that's for 6 months or more
that person has acted on these urges
or suffers from distress as a result
of having these feelings.
The individual also must be
at least 16 years of age
and at least 5 years older than
the juvenile involved
to meet criteria for pedophilia.
Pedophiles can be divided into
two main categories.
Exclusive pedophiles and
non-exclusive pedophiles.
Exclusive pedophiles are
only attracted to children
and non-exclusive pedophiles are
attracted to children and adults.
Exclusive pedophiles are sometimes
referred to as 'true pedophiles'.
They are only attracted to children.
Pedophiles are usually attracted to
a particular age range.
If the child is younger than 4 years
it is called, 'infantophilia'.
Usually 0 to 3 years on average.
If the child is pre-pubertal or early
pubertal it is called, 'pedophilia'.
13 and younger on average.
If the child is adolescent
it is called, 'hebophilia'.
Roughly 12 to 16 years.
Even though there are differences between
the sexual attraction to minors
only one term is mainly used by the media.
The word 'pedophilia'.
Professionally there's more difference
between an active pedophile
or an active offending pedophile
and a non-offender pedophile
who has sexual feelings for children
but who doesn't engage
in sexual activities with children
because he knows or she knows,
it's wrong.
Interview with a man who publicly
admits he is a Pedophile.
Why do I think that I'm a pedophile?
Well, I don't think
it's really a choice
because I think
you are born like that.
But on the other hand I think a lot of
people have those feelings and
they don't accept them,
they suppress them.
Firstly, I don't see myself
as 100% pedophile.
I also like people
who are above 18 years old,
and I think that sexuality
of every human is a mix.
I'm non-offending pedophile
and the difference between
offending and non-offending is obvious.
People who are offending
they are breaking the law.
Well, about child pornography.
You have virtual
child pornography;
manga and so on...
And sometimes I think
that's attractive...
and it's not illegal; drawings,
but real child
pornography is illegal
and I'm not watching that.
What I'm about to share with
you is startling.
A Delaware pediatrician is accused
of molesting his own patients.
Children.
Right there in his office.
Dr. Earl Bradley is accused of
molesting in fact,
more than a 100 children
in his office.
Some as young as 3 months old.
He possibly is the nation's worst
sex offender, sex molester
in the history.
That's according to documents
when you look at some of the numbers.
Here's his picture.
Just take a look at this guy.
Just everything has to be consensual.
No coercion...
Children can not be consensual.
Do you understand that?
Personally I wouldn't do it.
I mean I wouldn't go all the way to sex...
How can a 3-year-old be consensual?
Tell me!
There is a difference between a pedophile
who is attracted to 13 year olds,
and a pedophile
who is attracted to babies.
Pedophiles who are attracted
to babies are called 'infantophiles'.
Infantophilia is a subcategory
of pedophilia.
Infantophiles are usually
attracted to infants age 0 to 3.
Infantophilia is the most extreme form
of pedophilia.
Very little is known
about them because
they are a minority
amongst pedophiles.
But despite the mysteries
surrounding infantophiles
there is another group
that is even more mysterious.
This group is so mysterious that
many people do not even believe,
they can exist.
RECONSTRUCTED INTERVIEW
WITH A FEMALE PEDOPHILE
I don't think I'm a pedophile.
I know I am.
Whenever I see young
children, gender is
irrelevant especially in
vulnerable situations,
I feel more emotional and
physically feel harder.
I want to get intimate with them.
I want to
know them on a personal level.
I want them.
It has really taken any kind of
love out of my life.
I can't be with the people
that I love.
However I'm happily married to a man.
There is no passion in the marriage
but we do share a special bond.
It's like being best friends,
but closer.
So being a pedophile is
not to say that I can't have
a proper relationship
with an adult.
But what saddens me is that I cannot
imagine myself ever having kids of my own.
I used to spend a lot of time
sitting at the playground,
or the bleachers at the bowl
And just watch children.
Eventually I asked myself: Do I really
want to do this the rest of my life?
The answer was obvious.
I had to find something else
to occupy my time
and that is when
I took up cooking.
Whenever I feel an urge coming,
I cook.
My husband loves my food so there's
always somewhere to dump my urges away.
He is a huge source of support to me.
I'm also a head chef
at a popular restaurant.
Every last Tuesday of the month we have
a 'Make your own pizza' night.
And there are always large
amount of kids that come.
That is the day that I look forward
to the most each month.
For me personally I feel that my life is
not much different from other adults'.
Apart from the fact that I can not love
another person my age.
I'm able to control
my urges by cooking.
Those who cook well have lots of friends
and many of my friends have children.
I invite them over
for dinner all the time.
I know it's a customary for guests
to bring something like a bottle of wine
but I tell my guests not to.
Unknowingly what
they're bringing are their kids.
I feed them good food.
They bring their kids to play.
That's a fair trade to me.
Have I ever been in a relationship
with a minor as an adult?
Relationship no,
but I do have a story.
This was several years ago.
A friend brought her daughter
over for lunch.
In the middle of our meal her
daughter started bleeding.
So she went to her car
to get some napkins,
while I took the girl
to the bathroom.
There I took off her skirt
and her bengies.
I quickly took some towels
and starting wiping up.
Eventually I summed up the courage
to put my finger in, saying:
'This will help you
stop the bleeding.'
She nodded her head
and I screamed around.
I heard footsteps
nearing behind me.
So I took my finger out
and continued wiping.
My friend stood in the doorway
and said: 'Sorry for the mess.'
Oh, no problem.
No problem at all.
So a new school-year begins
and new teenager
comes home talking about how much
she likes one of his teachers.
Your first thought might be good.
I hope you learned something.
But the parents of one 14-year-old
in Florida were not happy
about what their son was learning
from a teacher in his school.
Her name was Debra Lafave.
And she is one of string of
young female teachers
who admitted having sex
with underage male students.
I don't believe that female
pedophiles exist because
women have less aggressive sex drive.
In this society treat this differently?
I mean if this was a man doing this
to a boy or man doing this to a girl,
would have been thought
in a same way would
the word "relationship"
even be used?
That's right. I mean sometimes I get
confused. You know, is it a crime story
or is it a love story? Was it consensual?
Was it a rape, you know?
All of that seems to be, you know, fodder
for discussion. We really don't know.
I think female pedophiles exist
because you have the classic stories of
high-school teachers
having an affair with boy students.
39-year-old, Anne Knopf
denied allegations,
that she had sex with
her daughter's ex
in the basement of her home while her
husband and children slept upstairs.
You may have even fantasies of you
doing it with some hot soccer mom
who is way older than you.
Because you know she's
a fully developed and
you'll be like: 'Oh,
yeah, I hit that.'
Females are generally not associated with
pedophilia in the eyes of modern society.
Women are seen as nursing, caring,
they would never harm children.
If a man hugs a strange child, people
would generally think he's a pervert.
But if a woman hugs a strange child,
people would think she is kind
and even nurtures children
they are not their own.
There is a clear double
standard when
it comes to pedophilia
between men and women.
This double standard has allowed
many offending female pedophiles
to go undetected.
Roughly 80% of the victims of female
pedophiles are not believed.
Furthermore boys are less likely
to report sexual abuse.
The media mainly talks
about female high school teachers
when it comes
to female pedophilia.
However, high school teachers
who have sexual activities
with teenagers
are not pedophiles.
If the child is in puberty it's called,
'hebophilia'.
This means that most
high school teachers
who have sex with children are
offending hebophiles.
Let me tell you something, man.
You know what? I'm sick
of pedophiles. Yeah.
Sex offenders. Dude,
they're on every channel
everybody is doing something
on sex offenders.
You know it's like, 'Dude, I got it.'
There's people out there touching kids.
You know.
But it's not everybody. It's a very
small portion of the population.
So you know, take it
down a few because you
are making a fucking
awkward out there.
Dude, I can't say 'Hi'
to kids anymore.
I love kids. I love kids.
I like making faces them on the airplane,
making them laugh.
Now parents are like,
'Is that a sex offender?'.
Hugging their children, make me
feel like a freak, you know.
I'm terrified of kids now.
The continuous attention
from the media
to pedophilia that makes you
suspicious,
when you see a man.
The number of male teachers in our primary
schools has fallen to just 1 in 8.
Does it matter?
Well, there is increasing
evidence that
young children are not seeing
enough male role models in schools.
Some men have been frightened off...
Yeah, I do think there is
a different perception of
men compare to women
in public places.
Depending on how they look,
if they are with or without children.
They will be looked at in a different way,
then a single female
sitting alone in a park, rather than it
was a male, might get a few funny looks.
Some educational experts believe
schools are too feminized nowadays.
Methodical working and
attentiveness having been
encouraged at the expense of
competition and leadership.
The things that boys respond best to.
Humans are designed
to protect their children
against all threats and will go
to the extreme to do so.
But when a society does not
understand the differences
between pedophiles
and hebophiles
or fails to understand pedophilia itself,
the consequences are disastrous.
Because when people do not understand
the parameters of pedophilia
anyone can be a pedophile,
especially man.
The fear and paranoia
from pedophilia has
become so extreme that
laws have been created
viewing all men as pedophiles.
Airlines have banned men from
sitting next to children in the plane.
Libraries have banned men
from the children section.
Children day-care centers have banned
fathers and male teenagers.
Companies have banned all literature
that contains underage sexuality,
which includes the banning of
the Bible, the Quran,
and the greatest love-story ever written,
Romeo and Juliette.
All this mass hysteria has transformed
the dynamics between men and children.
Men are now afraid of physical
contact with children
and are even afraid of showing public
affection towards their own children.
Boys are being told that all men
are potential pedophiles and then
they themselves will also become potential
sexual predators when they mature.
Women are also affected
by this mass hysteria.
Women with small breasts have been banned
from TV and magazines
because it encourages pedophilia.
Companies have also banned any depictions
that remotely resemble teen sexuality,
such as school uniforms,
cheerleader costumes and ponytails.
But companies and governments are not
only responding to the pedophilia hysteria
they are also participating.
Using the pedophilia hysteria as
an excuse to create new laws
that limit civil liberties
and silence oppositions.
Unfortunately, this is just
the tip of the iceberg.
The fear and paranoia surrounding
pedophilia has become so extreme
that it's started to backfire
on children.
A few years ago
this may have seemed impossible
but today governments are arresting
children and putting children in jail
in order to protect children
from pedophiles.
Child pornography is a
visual representation
of children under the age of 18
engaged in sexual activity,
lewd conduct or erotic behavior.
Many people believe that pedophiles are
the main cause of child pornography
But in reality, the pedophiles are not
the only ones who use child pornography.
Hebophiles are the main consumers
of child pornography.
Teen sex is the most searched form
of sex on the internet.
But not all teen sex is legal.
That's why child pornography
has become a 3 billion dollar industry.
Three times more than the income
of all online social gaming combined.
Child pornography is not just creepy,
basement videos with fat, hairy men.
The statistics of child pornography
include videos,
magazines, cable, pay per view,
CD's and the internet.
It's also used to promote escort services,
sex clubs, merchandise and phone sex.
Approximately 20% of all
internet pornography
involves children
under the age of 18.
Seeing that almost all men watch
pornography and 1/3 of women
means that many of us are not only
witnessed child pornography
but have also contributed
to the industry.
For example sending
underage naked pictures
of yourself to your
partner as a teenager.
The only time when it's not considered
child pornography
is when those images are
used by fashion industry.
Because when underage fashion models
show their private parts
it's considered artistic.
A 14-year-old New Jersey girl has been
accused of child pornography
after posting nearly 30 explicit nude
pictures of herself on MySpace.com.
If convicted' those charges could force
her to register as a sex offender.
I think sexting is about sending pictures
of naked people to other people.
And I heard from a girlfriend of mine that
she got a picture also from a guy naked.
I think we've completely lost
our minds, Mike.
We're seeing an epidemic
of these cases.
There is a case in Pennsylvania
of two girls at a slumber party,
teenagers, in pyjama tops and bottoms
broadcast pictures of each other
They're facing child porn charges. Have
we completely lost our minds? I mean...
I think that they do it because they
think it's funny or to bully somebody.
I've got five kids.
Let me tell you something.
We need to protect kids from themselves
too, not just the predators,
but from themselves.
When these photographs go out
they are out for good
and they are worldwide
available with a
push of a button.
Who likes that?
Let me tell you.
Who likes that? The predators
and the pornographers.
SEXTING
There are more phones
than people in the world.
Most of us use a mobile service,
called SMS.
SMS stands for,
'Short Message Service'.
The terms 'sexting' is a combination
of the word 'sex' and 'texting'
and refers to a practice of sending
sexually explicit photos electronically
mainly by cellphone.
Roughly 20 % of teenagers of
Western society admit to sexting.
That is more than 50 million
teenagers in Western society alone.
The problem is that all
content generated by
sexting can be considered
child pornography.
The teenager does not even
have to be naked
for to be considered
sexting as child pornography,
because child pornography
does not require nudity.
Any sexual activity, lewd conduct or
erotic behavior, even when fully clothed,
can be considered
child pornography.
The average teenager has no clue that
they're breaking the law by sexting.
But teenagers have been jailed, giving
probation and even committed suicide
because they could not deal with
the consequences of sexting.
In America 36% of all sex offenders
are children themselves.
Some law enforcements are
easing the sentences
Concerning child pornography
created by minors.
But sexting can not be
fully legalized without rewriting
the entire definition
of child pornography.
That however would allow adult hebophiles
and pedophiles to abuse the system.
THE CAUSE OF PEDOPHILIA
There are studies showing
that in pedophilia there are
a number of neurobiological differences
between pedophiles and...
The idea is that really
when the fetus is in the womb
that there are certain hormonal
processes that predispose
the person to develop
pedophilic sexual interests.
I think the main causes
for sexual orientation general
interaction between sex hormones
and developing brain
which is determined by genetic factors
and environmental factors.
On the other hand
there's the view that
pedophilia is also related
to early childhood experiences
of being physically abused
and/or sexually abused.
And the idea is that
if you are abused as a child
you learn that
That is a normal way
of interacting with adults,
so that's like an imprint
in your mind.
You think that's normal so that's why
that person who has those experiences
may develop sexual preferences
for children himself or herself
and act on those.
All researchers agreed that true
pedophilia is not a conscious choice.
Just like being homosexual
or heterosexual.
The main difference of true pedophilia
also known as exclusive pedophilia
starts off with problems
in sexual development.
Unlike most people who have a normal
sexual development into adulthood
a pedophile's sexual
development is blocked.
For example, when they are 13,
they prefer 13-year-old children,
but when they are 20, they still
prefer 13-year-old children.
And even when they are older they will
continue to prefer 13-year-old children.
Reconstructed interview with a married
Pedophile who has a wife and children.
When I was 12 years old, I noticed that
I was sexually attracted to boys.
I wasn't happy with this and
I didn't deal with it.
I found it especially unfortunate
that I absolutely did not have
these feelings for older boys,
or men, girls, women.
I didn't choose this and
nothing bad happened
in my youth that will effect
my orientation.
I grew up in a warm and loving family, I
liked going to school, I had many friends.
At that time I went to church
regularly and I believed in God
As a young teenager I prayed
a lot. At first I thought it will pass
but deep inside I knew very well
that this would never happen.
My biggest concern was not
my feelings of love for boys but
more than the lack of feelings
to peers and adults.
It has changed my life completely.
I've been in love several times
I was very unhappy because I saw
the impossibility of a real relationship
and I couldn't share my feelings
with anyone.
Until I was 30 nobody has ever known
anything about my orientation.
I have tried to suppress my feelings
and live a normal life.
This succeeded quite good
until I reached 30.
I've had almost everything,
that one desires.
A dear friend once said to me, Should you
be persecuted if you do not understand me
He said, "You have a lovely wife and
children, you've completed your studies
you have got a good job.
Many people would envy you."
Yes, I have fought hard
to make something of it.
Still I always carry my secret with me.
The burden of this secret was too big.
In that period I told my wife
about my orientation.
For her it was a big disappointment
and still is a difficult subject.
I always felt guilty about fooling my
wife, my friends, my family, colleagues.
No one knew who I really was.
I wanted to have no secrets anymore.
Me and my wife had a child.
The family was my ideal.
Actually I always wanted to be normal.
Just fully accepted in society.
Not being an exception.
I find and I think that to some extent
still it is that I betrayed my wife.
An awful love thought because I really
love her and she deserves better.
TREATMENT OF PEDOPHILIA
There is no cure for pedophilia.
You can't change the deviant
sexual preference.
What you can do is two things.
One: you can intervene
at level of the sex drive.
So there are pharmacological agents that
really decrease the libido of the person.
So that means you stop
their sexual activity completely.
Also called chemical castration.
That's one option but this type of
treatment has many harmful side effects.
You can think about osteoporosis.
I mean serious osteoporosis.
Depression, feminization.
So in the long term, this type of
treatment is not an option.
Second possibility is
psychological treatment.
That means you work on
the psychological problems
that actually make the person
act out of their pedophilic interests.
So you can think about
maybe the person has
the idea that is ok to have
sex with children.
That children are not harmed by it.
That they actually may
benefit from it.
And that is a kind of sex education.
These types of cognitive distortion
need to be diminished,
need to be reduced in treatment.
Also a lot of pedophiles lack empathy,
lack insight into
what their behavior does
to the children.
So I'm talking here,
of course about
pedophiles who act on
their sexual preference.
These types of treatments are necessary
and are generally quite effective
in reducing the risk of a pedophile
again abusing children.
THE FUTURE OF PEDOPHILIA
I don't think thst pedophilia will
become accepted because
like I said the public associate
pedophilia with active
sexual relationships between
adults and children.
And condemn this. So I don't think
it will be accepted.
Yes, I think ultimately pedophilia
will be accepted.
Maybe it will take,
you know' a 100 more years.
Yeah, it's just like homosexuality.
In the DSM II,
they came out in the 1950s,
homosexuality was listed
as a mental disorder.
Well, it's not anymore.
And I think it can happen that
we can consider this sexual preference
as a natural variation.
And of course we still will
need to make sure that
a pedophile doesn't act on
those sexual preferences,
but I think the fact that the person
has that preference I think
we will arrive at a point in time when
that's just a given, considered a given.
So at one end I think that pedophilia
will never be accepted
because it involves
damage of children.
But we should also remember,
that many of the people
who are focusing their
sexual orientation
towards children
can keep their impulses in such a way
that they don't damage children.
Pedophilia is an orientation,
not an action.
We can not condemn an orientation
but we can condemn an action.
Having sex with young children before
puberty will never become accepted
because it damages children.
However sexual relations between
adults and adolescent children
might become more accepted
by modern society.
As strange as this may sound
this future development is
not new for western society.
If we look at the past
we can see that
Western society treated sexuality
completely different.
The Greeks and Romans
practiced pederasty,
in particularly in ancient Greece it was
a very well-known social institution.
And that would typically
involve a relationship
between an older man
and a younger boy.
However a younger boy would not mean
a real child as we would understand it.
A boy in homoerotic relationship
in ancient Greece
would be in adolescent
so in his puberty.
So if we were to translate
this behavior
in ancient Greece into modern terms
of modern sexology
we would rather call it hebophilia.
Hebophilia is not listed
as a mental disorder
because finding teenagers
attractive is normal.
Children before puberty can not understand
lust but children in puberty can.
However we must remember that teenagers
are still in sexual development
The larger the age difference
between adults and teenagers
the more chance there is
for an imbalance of power.
Sex should always be consensual.
No matter what age.
I don't at all have a problem
when two consenting adults having sex,
even they're teenagers.
That's ok if they are
both giving consents.
Where I've come from I don't see
problem waiting either.
This is a very hard to look at when
you've come where I've come from
and had the experiences that I had.
I was made into a sexual being
from before my earliest memory.
I would have wanted that chance
and wanted to explore
and make my own decisions
about what was right
for my body at the time.
Sex was always
something used against me
from before I can even comprehend
what was happening.
Such adult choices, such adult actions
were forced on me
no matter what the consequences
to me physically and psychologically.
I have 7-year-old twins and I hope
and pray every day that
they are given a chance to make their
own decisions when they are ready.
Their innocence is so precious
and I'll do everything I can to make sure
that's taken care of.
For most of us the age of attraction
doesn't change. Instead it expands.
This means that the very first people
who we'll find attractive
will remain in our age of attraction.
Usually this begins in early puberty.
When we pass the age of 18
we do not automatically remove children
under the age of 18
from our age of attraction.
We are not automatically programmed
to adjust our age of attraction
to fit the legal age of the majority.
Because 18, it's just a number.
THE END
Do I think that
all men are pedophiles?
Yes, I do think that
all men are pedophiles.
If you consider
the general definition of pedophilia
Someone who is attracted
to someone below the age of 18.
Then, yes.
All men are pedophiles.
But my answer would also be, no.
If you consider the professional
definition of pedophilia
or the real definition
of pedophilia.
Someone who is attracted
to children who are pre-pubertal
Then no.
Not all men are pedophiles.
Unfortunately, there aren't
many people who know
the real definition of pedophilia.
