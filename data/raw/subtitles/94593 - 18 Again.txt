  Indistinct ]
COPS !  COPS !

NAH, I THINK THEY'RE WAITING
OVER THERE TO TAKE US OUT
FOR SOME DOUGHNUTS LATER.
GIVE ME THE PAINT.

- OH, DAVID, I'M SORRY.
NOW THE CAN.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER
IN HISTORY... CLASS.
[ Chuckles ]
HI, GRANDPA.
[ Door Opens ]
SQUID !
[ Laughing ]
WHAT IS IT YOU DO
AT NIGHT, WATSON ?
WHATEVER IT IS, PLEDGE,
STOP IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHERE'S MY ART HISTORY PAPER ?
IT'S ALMOST DONE.
WHAT'S IT ON ?
CEZANNE, THE IMPRESSIONIST.
LIKE RICH LITTLE.
- [ Laughing ]
- SORT OF.
GIVE US 20.
[ Laughing ]
NO, NO,
LEAVE THE BACKPACK ON.
AND ONE.
ALL THE WAY DOWN.
TWO.
KEEP YOUR BACK
STRAIGHT.
THREE.  VERY GOOD.
HERE'S A LITTLE
INCENTIVE.
[ Laughing ]
YOU ALL HAVE YOUR ASSIGNMENTS
FOR THE MIDTERM PAPER ?
YEAH.
EVERY STUDENT HAS BEEN GIVEN
A TOPIC ENTIRELY AT RANDOM.
YOU THINK IT'S LOVE,
BUT IT'S MERELY LUST.
"MERELY" ?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HER ?
SHE HAS A HEAD
ON HER SHOULDERS,
FOR ONE THING.
MOST OF HER APPENDAGES SEEM
TO BE PROPERLY PLACED.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT,
OKAY ?
[ Laughs ]
BUT REMEMBER
WHO SHE GOES OUT WITH.
JUST FORGET IT.
[ Sighs ]
ROBIN ?
UH... I GUESS I'M JUST A LITTLE
DISAPPOINTED, PROFESSOR.
[ Professor ]
YOU ARE ?
[ Robin ]
YEAH.
I WAS SORT OF HOPING
I COULD DO MY THESIS
ON THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION.
WHY, DEAR ?
BECAUSE HE WAS CUTER
THAN TRUMAN ?
[ Students Laughing ]
NO, BECAUSE I FEEL
THE ERA IS MORE RELEVANT
TO CURRENT HISTORY.
[ Professor ]
AND YOU DON'T KNOW AS MUCH
ABOUT TRUMAN, DO YOU ?
NO.
WELL, WE ARE HERE
TO LEARN, ARE WE NOT ?
I'M SURE
YOU'LL FIND HARRY TRUMAN
TO BE VERY STIMULATING.
EVERYBODY WANTS YOUR GIRL.
[ Whispers ]
SHUT UP.
LOOK AT THE TEACHER.
 LOOK AT THE TEACHER.
SHUT UP.  SHUT UP.
THE SUBJECT IS
A SPECIALITY OF MINE,
AS YOU KNOW, ROBIN.
SO I'LL BE ABLE
TO GIVE YOU...
GUIDANCE, INPUT.
THANK YOU.
[ Coach ]
PICK UP THE PACE !  DO IT !
[ Spectators Cheering ]
WAY TO GO !  WAY TO GO !
GET OUT OF MY WAY, MAN !
YOU'RE SLOWING ME DOWN !
I'M NOT KIDDING, MAN !
MOVE !
- [ Gasps ]
- [ Laughing ]
ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT !
- YEAH !  YEAH !
THAT WAS A BAD BREAK.
LOOK OUT.
ARE YOU OKAY ?
YES, I'M FINE.
HEY, AREN'T WE-- YOU
IN MY AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS ?
- YEAH, I THINK SO.
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT ?
CLASS
OR HISTORY ?
UH--
CLASS I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT.
PROFESSOR SWIVET--
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
BUT I LOVE HISTORY.
IT'S MY MAJOR.
IT'S YOUR MAJOR
AND YOU LOVE IT ?
THAT'S
A NEW ONE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?
ME ?  UH, MY MAJOR
IS BUSINESS,
OH.
BUT I'M REALLY NOT
INTERESTED IN--
HEY, BABE.
HI.
HI.
TOUGH BREAK
OUT THERE, MAN,
BUT THAT'S THE WAY
THEY FALL SOMETIMES.
I DIDN'T EVEN
TELL HER MY NAME.
I AM A DWEEB.
WATCH OUT,
SQUID.
I'M HERE TO SEE
MY FATHER AT--
[ Man Over Intercom ]
IS MY BRILLIANT SON HERE YET ?
YES, SIR.
SEND HIM IN.
[ Son ]
I'LL THANK YOU TO TREAT ME
WITH A LITTLE MORE RESPECT, SIR.
YOU HAVE TO PRESS
THE BUTTON IF YOU WANT
YOUR DAD TO HEAR YOU.
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.
SEND DAVID IN
AS SOON AS HE GETS HERE.
[ Sighs ]
DAD ?
I KNOW YOU THOUGHT
THE DUCK PHONES WERE
A MISTAKE FROM THE BEGINNING.
I KNOW I SAID MY DEPARTMENT
COULD GUARANTEE MOVING...
AT LEAST 500,000 UNITS
IN THE FIRST YEAR.
I DON'T FEEL, THOUGH,
THAT WE'RE REACHING THE IDEAL
CONSUMER: DUCK HUNTERS,
[ Toilet Flushing ]
WHEN A DUCK HUNTER SEES A DUCK,
HE WANTS TO SHOOT IT.
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK INTO ITS ASS.
IT MIGHT ANSWER BACK.
ANYWAY, YOU'RE IN SALES.
JUST SELL THE DAMN THINGS.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE ?
THESE ARE SOME BLUEPRINTS
I DREW UP FOR RETOOLING--
"RETOOLING" ?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE,
PRETENDING TO BE A DESIGNER ?
IS THAT WHY
YOU KEEP SCREWING UP ?
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU PRETENDING
TO BE, AN ASTRONAUT ?
COME DOWN TO EARTH.
I NEED YOU HERE.
YOU'RE LATE !
ALL I ASK OF YOU IS TWO
AFTERNOONS A WEEK AT 3:30 SHARP.
IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK ?
BUT YOU WOULD RATHER
HOIST SOME BEERS
WITH YOUR FRAT BUDDIES...
OR PAL AROUND
WITH YOUR TRACK TEAMMATES.
WHAT'S FUNNY ?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MOST PEOPLE
WOULD GIVE TO HAVE A POSITION
IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS ?
GIVE THE KID A BREAK.
HELLO, DAVID.
HI, GRANDPA.
WHAT KEPT YOU THIS TIME ?
UH, TRACK PRACTICE
AGAIN.
WHAT WAS YOUR TIME ?
4:56.
4:56 ?  WHAT IS IT
WITH ONLY ONE BROKEN LEG ?
DAD--
NO, HE'S RIGHT.
I COULD DO BETTER.
SO COULD OPRAH WINFREY.
ALL RIGHT, DAD, HE DIDN'T
INHERIT YOUR LEGS.
THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M STILL USING THEM.
4:56.
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
I RAN A 4:56,
BUT I HAD
LUCY MULHANEY ON MY BACK
AND A BEER IN EACH HAND.
4:56.
I'LL SEE YOU BOTH TONIGHT.
WHY AM I LEAVING ?
THIS IS MY OFFICE.
OUT, KIDS.
4:56.
[ Laughs ]

[ Man ]
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACK.
MAY I TAKE YOUR COAT ?
[ Jack ]
BETTY.
OH.
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LOOK BETTER.
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T MEAN
YOUR EYESIGHT IS FAILING YOU.
NOT AT ALL.
GETTING STRONGER.
I STILL CAN'T
FIGURE OUT...
HOW MY SON HERE
HOOKED YOU.
DID HE PUT SOMETHING
IN YOUR DRINK ?
[ Laughs ]
DAD--
THAT'S A JOKE, KID.
LIGHTEN UP.
I'M GLAD YOU BOTH
COULD MAKE IT.
"MAKE IT" ?
OH, YOU MEAN TO THE PARTY.
TO THE PARTY.
ARE YOU KIDDING ?
WE WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR--
MOLLY BRAYMILLER,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[ Woman ]
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SWEETHEART.
FOR ANYTHING.
HELLO, EVERYBODY !
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.
JUST BE THANKFUL
SHE'S NOT AS YOUNG
AS SHE SAYS SHE IS.
[ Son ]
IF SHE WERE AS YOUNG
AS SHE SAYS SHE IS,
THOSE WOULD BE SCHOOLBOOKS
SHE'S CARRYING.
I THINK YOU ALL KNOW
MY COMPANION, PLAYMATE
AND CONFIDANTE, MADELYN.
BUT NOT LIKE I KNOW HER.
[ Giggles ]
BUT WE'LL GET INTO THAT LATER.
DOESN'T SHE LOOK SENSATIONAL ?
[ Clears Throat ]
YOU'RE REQUESTED
IN THE KITCHEN,
MISS EVELYN.
MADELYN.
THANK YOU.
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
I'M SORRY.
MISS EVELYN
WAS THE TALL ONE.
SOME GIRL, HUH ?
DON'T YOU THINK
SHE'S A LITTLE
TOO YOUNG FOR YOU ?
LOOK, I'D GO OUT
WITH WOMEN MY AGE,
BUT THERE ARE
NO WOMEN MY AGE.
[ Groans ]
I THINK
YOU BETTER FIND ONE.
DO YOU WANT YOUR MOTHER
TO DO THAT ?
IS THIS A CLIP-ON ?
GOD, DON'T LET
YOUR GRANDFATHER SEE IT.
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS ?
IT'S ONE OF DAD'S.
GRANDPA, I JUST WANT
TO SAY THAT...
WHEN I'M YOUR AGE...
I HOPE I'M HALF
AS LIVELY AS YOU ARE.
DON'T LOOK TO THE FUTURE, KID.
YOU'RE HALF AS LIVELY NOW.
IS THAT A CLIP-ON ?
YOU HEARD HIM:
"GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT."
HE JUST MEANT HE WAS GLAD
WE COULD MAKE IT TO THE PARTY.
YOU UNDERESTIMATE HIM.
THE MAN IS OBSESSED
WITH SEX.
WHEN HE SAYS,
"GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT,"
IT'S A SEXUAL BARB.
YEAH.
HELLO, DAVID.
GREAT PARTY, HUH ?
YOUR GRANDPA
DESERVES THE BEST.
LIKE ME.
I'M THE BEST.
[ Sighs ]
HE'S QUITE A GUY.
AH, YES, HE IS
REMARKABLE.
BUT, DAVID,
THERE IS SUCH
A GREAT DIFFERENCE
IN OUR AGES, YOU KNOW.
THAT'S TRUE, BUT--
BUT HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW...
UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN
WITH AN OLDER WOMAN ?
HAVE YOU ?
UH--
THEN AGAIN,
YOU AND I AREN'T THAT
FAR APART, ARE WE ?
IN AGE, I MEAN.
[ Sighs ]
IT'S A SEXY TIE.
IS IT A CLIP-ON ?
UH,  YES,
I-I BELIEVE SO.
DO I MAKE YOU NERVOUS,
DAVID ?
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
HOW ARE YOU TWO
GETTING ALONG ?
[ Sighs ]
FAMOUSLY.
COME ON, DAVID.
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
I WANT YOU TO MEET.
[ Madelyn ]
LATER, DAVID.
GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW
MY GRANDSON DAVID.
HE'S A FRESHMAN,
LAMBDA CHI DELTA
AT ROSSMORE.
GOOD TO KNOW YOU.
THAT'S SOME GRIP.
YOU PLAY FOOTBALL ?
TRACK.  TRACK.
JUST LIKE ME.
NOT EXACTLY LIKE ME,
BUT TRACK.
YOU MUST DO PRETTY WELL
WITH THE GIRLS.
HE'S A WATSON,
A WATSON.
I BET HE'S BEATING THEM OFF
WITH A STICK.
- YEAH, THEY ACT LIKE I AM.
- WHAT'D YOU SAY ?
HE SAID, "YOU BETTER
BELIEVE I AM."
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID ?
I DIDN'T HEAR IT.
I JUST HEARD HIM.
SAY IT.  "YOU BETTER
BELIEVE I AM."
YOU BETTER BELIEVE I AM.
YEAH, HE SAID IT.

THANKS FOR LETTING ME

YOU'RE WELCOME, KID.

UH, NAH, NOT REALLY.
THERE WAS ALL THAT
GOOD FOOD AT THE PARTY.
DON'T TELL ME YOU ATE
ANY OF THAT STUFF.
NO.
GOOD.  WE'LL GO
TO KELLERS.
OKAY.
- WHERE IS IT ?
- IT'S IN ALTOONA.
"WHERE IS IT ?"
KEEP DRIVING, KID.
- WHERE'S ALTOONA ?

"WHERE'S
 ALTOONA ?"

YOU'LL NEVER AGAIN
HAVE AS WIDE A SELECTION.
TRUST ME.
THERE IS ONE.
ONE IS ENOUGH FOR STARTERS.
WHAT'S HER NAME ?
ROBIN.
WHAT'S SHE LIKE ?
SHE'S GREAT.  SHE'S SMART.
 SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
AND I'LL BOOK A CHURCH.
I DON'T KNOW.
WE HAVEN'T SAID MUCH
TO EACH OTHER.
WHAT, IS SHE A MIME ?
TALKING TO WOMEN
IS NO BIG DEAL.
HERE, WATCH.
- [ Woman ]  MORE COFFEE ?
 - PLEASE.  "RITA."
IS THAT YOUR NAME,
OR ARE YOU WEARING
SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLOTHES ?
[ Laughs ]
THAT'S MY NAME.
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE ?
JUST YOUR PHONE NUMBER.
WE'LL TRADE.  YOU CAN HAVE
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.
[ Laughing ]
DID YOU HEAR THAT ?
SHE PRACTICALLY THREW HERSELF
NAKED ACROSS THE TABLE.
NOT QUITE.
ANYWAY, YOU CAN
GET AWAY WITH THAT.
ME ?  I JUST SOUND LIKE
50 OTHER GUYS THAT DAY
WHO GAVE HER THE SAME LINES.
IT'S NOT THE LINES.
 IT'S THE DELIVERY.
MAYBE I SHOULD
GET MYSELF A CIGAR.
COULDN'T HURT.
WE SHOULD DO THIS
MORE OFTEN.
GRANDPA !
[ Monitor Beeping ]
[ Jack ]
I SHOULD HAVE LET THE KID DRIVE.
HE OPENED HIS EYES.
[ Jack ]
BRILLIANT.
YOU SHOULD BE A DOCTOR.
HMM, HE'S AWAKE.
[ Jack ]
SO SHOULD YOU.
OH, BROTHER.
MY BODY'S BROKEN,
AND THEY SEND AN OPTOMETRIST.
CAN YOU TALK ?
[ David ]
SURE.  WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY ?
[ Jack ]
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO MY VOICE ?
MUST HAVE STRADDLED
THE GEARSHIFT.
OH, GOD.  THANK GOD.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
[ David ]
FINE, BUT MY VOICE
SOUNDS A LITTLE FUNNY.
BUT OTHERWISE I FEEL
LIKE I CAN GO TEN ROUNDS
WITH JACK DEMPSEY.
HOW'S DAVID ?
[ Jack ]
HOLY SHIT !
TAKE IT EASY, DAVID.
[ Jack ]
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ?
HERE, HONEY,
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN ?
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
[ Jack ]
I'VE GOT TO TRY
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
[ Jack ]
BOY, DAVID, DID YOU GET
THE SHORT END OF THE DEAL.
[ Betty ]  I REALLY WISH
YOU'D COME HOME AND SLEEP
IN YOUR OWN BED TONIGHT.
NO.  NO, THANKS.
[ Jack ]
THIS WILL BE BAD ENOUGH.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
HOW GRANDPA'S DOING.
[ Jack ]
NOT TOO WELL,

ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, DADDY.
TAKE IT EASY.
GOOD-BYE, HONEY.

[ Jack ]
HOLD THAT SMILE, JACK.
YOU CAN DO IT.
[ Shouting ]
[ Laughing ]
YEE-HA !
[ Laughing, Shouts ]
NO, NO, NO !
[ Jack ]
THIS COULD BE INTERESTING.
[ Jack ]
YOU'LL GET USED TO THEM.
TRUST ME.
[ Groans ]
PAPERS.
[ Jack ]
"PAPERS" ?  WHAT AM I,
A COCKER SPANIEL ?
THEY'RE DUE, WATSON.
THEY ARE ?
CAN YOU RUN THAT
BY ME AGAIN ?
[ Laughing ]
WE DON'T MEAN
TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT WE'D LIKE TO--
OH,
THINK NOTHING OF IT.
I'M ALWAYS EAGER
TO HELP OUT A FELLOW
LAMBDA CHI DELTA BROTHER.
DON'T JERK AROUND, WATSON.
IF WE DON'T GET
THOSE PAPERS IN ON TIME,
WE GET SOME SERIOUS SHIT.
LET ME SEE IF
I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY.
YOU BOYS WANT ME
TO DO YOUR SCHOOLWORK ?
GIVE ME 20, WATSON.
WELL, I CAN
LEND YOU TEN FOR NOW.
[ Grunts ]
[ Jack ]
A SIMPLE NO WOULD BE ENOUGH.
TWENTY PUSH-UPS.
NOW.
BY THE WAY,
SMART-ASS,
NOBODY BETTER FIND OUT
YOU'RE DOING THIS WORK
FOR US.
UNDERSTOOD ?
[ Jack ]
WHO AM I GONNA TELL,
DAN RATHER ?
DON'T SLACK OFF,
WATSON.
[ Jack ]
SIX MORE PUSH-UPS,
AND I'LL BE ABLE
TO KILL THIS KID.
[ Jack ]
JESUS, DOES DAVID WAKE UP
TO THIS EVERY DAY ?
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ?
TWENTY MORE ?
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON ME.
THEY WERE KIND OF ROUGH
ON YOU, HUH ?
[ Jack ]
SO THIS IS THAT
WEIRDO FRIEND OF DAVID'S.
WHAT ?
IT'S MY EARRING.
[ Jack ]
WHAT NEXT ?
[ Jack ]
DOES THIS KID EVER
GIVE HIS MOUTH A BREAK ?
SOMEBODY WAKE ME
WHEN HE SHUTS UP.
WHY DO THEY FORCE
THESE HUMANITIES COURSES
DOWN KIDS' THROATS ?
IT'S GOT NO BEARING ON
THE REAL WORLD WHATSOEVER.
THAT'S WHY IT'S
YOUR FAVORITE CLASS.
IT IS ?
TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DO
SOME QUICK STUDIES.  RAYETTE.
YOU GOTTA STOP HITTING
THAT SNOOZE BUTTON.
OHH-HOO-HOO-HOO !
OH, YEAH !  HELLO !
DAVID...
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM ?
DO YOU REALIZE THE LAST TIME
I SAW A NAKED LADY ?
[ Jack ]
IT WAS LAST THURSDAY,
BUT IT STILL GETS ME.
IF THERE IS ONE PERSON
I EXPECT TO TAKE THIS
CLASS SERIOUSLY,
IT'S YOU.
[ Jack ]  AFTER CLASS
I'LL BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE
AND A LARGE HOUSE WITH SERVANTS.
YOU'RE LOOSENING UP,
DAVID.
THAT'S GOOD.
I'M SHOCKED TO SEE A BIT
OF A PICASSO INFLUENCE.
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.
OH, SURE.
I THREW THAT IN.
NOT TOO MUCH.
JUST A LITTLE.
LIKE A SPRINKLING,
A SEASONING ON TOP.
[ Sighs ]
ARE WE IN EVERY CLASS
HERE TOGETHER ?
THIS IS BEGINNING
TO WORRY ME.
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?
AH, LOOK,
THERE SHE IS.
ROBIN.
SHE IS SOMETHING,
EVEN WITHOUT SPEAKING.
SO, IS EVERYONE
COMING ALONG
WITH THEIR PAPERS ?
OH.
YES, ROBIN ?
I CAN'T FIND HARRY TRUMAN'S
MIDDLE NAME.
[ Laughs ]
[ Jack ]
HANDS OFF MY GIRL,
YOU OLD LECH.
THAT'S BECAUSE HARRY TRUMAN
DIDN'T HAVE A MIDDLE NAME.
HIS PARENTS COULDN'T DECIDE
ON ONE, SO THEY GAVE HIM
AN INITIAL, "S,"
BUT THE "S" DOESN'T
STAND FOR ANYTHING.
[ Laughs,

[ Students Murmuring ]
YES ?
OH... I'M SORRY.
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
PLEASE, GO ON.
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST FISH
TO SWALLOW THAT LINE.
AND YOUR NAME IS ?
- HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW MY NAME,
  AND I'M IN HIS CLASS.
- [ Laughing ]
DAVID WATSON.
[ Swivet ]
OH, I SEE.
WHAT DOES THE "S" STAND FOR,
MR. WATSON ?
SERGEI,
FROM AN EAST EUROPEAN UNCLE.
BUT, FORESEEING THE RUSSIAN
TROUBLES THAT WOULD FOLLOW
AFTER WORLD WAR II,
HARRY MADE UP THAT HOGWASH
ABOUT THE "S."
[ Swivet ]
AND WHERE DID YOU COME BY
THIS INFORMATION ?
FROM THE MAN HIMSELF.
[ Girl ]
YEAH, UH-HUH.
[ Laughing ]
HARRY TOLD YOU ?
NO, HE DIDN'T TELL ME.
HE TOLD MY GRANDFATHER.
MY GRANDFATHER AND HARRY
WERE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS.
MY GRANDFATHER TOLD ME.
I SEE.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT
TO KNOW, PROFESSOR,
DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
[ Students Laughing ]
[ Chattering ]
YOU GONNA
STAY OUT OF MY WAY
TODAY, WATSON ?
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ?
- RON DEACON.
- WHAT ?
YOU'RE RON DEACON'S
GRANDSON, AREN'T YOU ?
I THOUGHT
YOU LOOKED FAMILIAR.
YOU GOT THAT SAME
DULL LOOK IN THE EYES,
THE SAME JUNIOR JOCKSTRAP.
WHAT ?
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS
FOR YOU, RUSS.
YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS BALD
BY THE TIME HE GRADUATED,
WHICH MEANS YOU'LL PROBABLY
START LOSING YOUR HAIR IN--
HELL,
WHAT TIME IS IT ?
[ Whistle Blows ]
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?
NOTHING, COACH.
COME ON !
GET YOUR FANNIES IN ACTION !

WATCH THIS, HONEY.
YEAH !
[ Jack ]
I'M EXHAUSTED.
I GOTTA CUT DOWN
ON THOSE PUSH-UPS.
LOOK WHAT YOU GET
FOR FIRST PLACE.
SECOND PLACE, YOU GET A HUG
FROM A PUDGY COACH.
DAVID !
YOU QUALIFIED !
I'D HAVE BLOWN HIS DOORS OFF
IF I WASN'T WEARING
THESE WEDGIES.
YEAH, BUT YOU MADE IT !
YOU MADE IT !
HI.
HI.
YOU'RE MAKING QUITE A NAME
FOR YOURSELF TODAY.
YOU QUALIFIED, DIDN'T YOU ?
HEY, IS THAT TRUE
ABOUT TRUMAN'S MIDDLE NAME ?
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.
NO, HE TOLD
YOUR GRANDFATHER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH.
[ Laughs ]
WELL, DID HE TELL YOU
A LOT ABOUT HARRY TRUMAN ?
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.
LISTEN, I'M DOING THIS PAPER
ON HIM IN OUR CLASS, AND, UH...
I'D MUCH RATHER TALK TO YOU
THAN PROFESSOR SWIVET.
THAT'S FLATTERING.
OH, NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.
I-I JUST--
I'D BE GLAD TO.
NOW, THIS WEEKEND'S NO GOOD.
IT'LL HAVE TO BE
MONDAY NIGHT... OVER DINNER.
AROUND 8:00.
I'LL COME BY FOR YOU.

WAS THERE AN ACCIDENT ?
NO, DAVID.
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.
HELLO.
DON'T WORRY.
IT WON'T COME OFF.

YOU'RE STILL SHRINKING--
UH, GROWING.
TELL ME, DAVID, HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER ?
SUPPORT HER ?
SHE WANTS SUPPORT,
SHE CAN BUY A CANE.
YOU KNOW, HE KNEW
HARRY TRUMAN PERSONALLY.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE HUNG AROUND WITH
ULYSSES S. GRANT !
WE'RE THINKING OF TRAVELING
THROUGH EUROPE TOGETHER
THIS SUMMER.
THAT SHOULD BE FASCINATING
FOR YOU, DAVID.
IT'S CHANGED A LOT
SINCE THE RENAISSANCE.
I KNEW THIS WOULDN'T WORK OUT.
OUR AGES ARE TOO FAR APART.
THEY'D BE CLOSER IF YOU
DROP A ZERO FROM YOURS.
LOOK, MISTER, YOU BETTER
HOPE YOU NEVER GROW OLD.
I'M HOPING YOU WON'T.

DAVID, CAN YOU
HELP ME WITH THIS ?
COME ON !
OH, SORRY.
RIGHT THERE.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
WHY NOT ?
[ Jack ]
BECAUSE I CAN'T PAINT,

THAT NEVER STOPPED YOU BEFORE.
WHY DO YOU DO THIS ?
WHAT ARE YOU

WHY ?
THAT'S NOT ALL I DO,

YOU REMEMBER MY WISH
AT THE PARTY ?
YOU MADE A WISH ?
NO, JACK DID.
OH, I SEE.
JACK DID, YOU DIDN'T.
NO.
DO YOU BELIEVE A PERSON
CAN GO FROM ONE BODY
TO ANOTHER ?
NOT IF THAT PERSON'S
GOT A WEAK BACK.
[ Chuckles ]
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
I MEAN THEIR SOUL.
LOOK INTO MY EYES, CHARLIE.
WHAT DO YOU SEE ?
NOW, DON'T YOU SEE
EXPERIENCE, WISDOM ?
EH ?
I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH, KID.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
WHICH ONE IS THE WISDOM ?
FORGET "KID."
YOU'RE THE KID.
I'M 81 YEARS OLD.
YEAH, UH, LOOK, DAVID,
MAYBE WE OUGHT
TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL
AND FIND YOU A NICE NURSE.
NO, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GOES FOR NURSES.

TO BE PRECISE,
ON A HORSE NAMED
PRUNE DANISH.
COME ON, COME ON.
YOUR GRANDPA COULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THAT.
RIGHT, SURE.  AND MAYBE
HE SAT HIS GRANDSON
DOWN UPON HIS KNEE...
AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THE TIME
HE AND HIS FRIEND CHARLIE...
GOT SNOWED IN
WITH THE ST. BARTHOLOMEW
ALL-GIRLS CHOIR...
AND DIDN'T GET DUG OUT
UNTIL EASTER.
OR HOW ONCE UPON A TIME
THEY GOT DRUNK WITH TWO
U.S.O. GIRLS AND--
# BY THE LIGHT #
# OF THE SILVERY MOON #
# YOUR SISTER JUNE #
# DROPPED HER PANTS
  IN MY ROOM #
# AND NEXT DOOR #
# WE WERE WITH ELEANOR #
# SHE WANTED MORE #
# BUT WE HAD SOME
  BEFORE ##
JACK !
CHARLIE, I GOT MY WISH.
I'M 18 AGAIN.
WHAT ?
[ Laughing ]
EASY, CHARLIE.
H-HOW DID YOU
PULL IT OFF ?
I DIDN'T.
I DON'T KNOW.
THE ACCIDENT--
SOMEHOW WE GOT SWITCHED.
YOU--
SO DAVID'S IN--
WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM ?
I WISH I KNEW.
OH, MY GOD.
JACK WATSON,
YOU HAD IT ALL.
AND NOW YOU REALLY
HAVE IT ALL.
GEE, I WISH I COULD
DO IT WITH YOU.
SO DO I, CHARLIE.
YOU WERE ALWAYS LIKE
A KID BROTHER TO ME.
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO CHANGE
ANYTHING BETWEEN US.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
# BY THE LIGHT #
# OF THE SILVERY MOON ##
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY ?
YOU'VE BARELY TOUCHED YOUR FOOD.
I'M NOT VERY HUNGRY.
I THOUGHT SOLE FLORENTINE
WAS YOUR FAVORITE.
LOOK WHAT I ALMOST FORGOT.
CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN.
PLEASE, I CAN'T EAT
ANOTHER BITE.
OH.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WASTE
A TOTALLY GOOD MEAL.
NOW, EAT IT.
ARNOLD, HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO EAT IF HE
DOESN'T WANT TO.
HE'S BEEN THROUGH
QUITE A LOT.
WHAT ?  THE ACCIDENT
INJURED HIS TASTE BUDS ?
AND IS THAT HIS EXCUSE
FOR DRESSING LIKE THAT ?
OR DID YOU HAVE
ANOTHER ACCIDENT
ON THE WAY OVER HERE ?
IT WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO PUT
YOUR FATHER IN THE HOSPITAL.
I WASN'T TALKING
TO MY FATHER, WAS I ?
WATCH IT.
TRICK QUESTION.
AND SPEAKING OF DAD,
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO DOWN
AND VISIT HIM TOMORROW.
YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE
MORE OFTEN, ARNIE.
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU.
YOU GOT ANY DECENT COGNAC
IN THIS PLACE ?
[ Jack ]
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.
CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN,
RIGHT ?
[ Jack ]
MAYBE THEY CAN
MAKE ONE OUT OF THIS.
[ Chuckling Softly ]
[ Sighs ]
##
GOD, MADDY,
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
WELL, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU TOO, DAVID.
WE HAVE TO TALK.
SURE.
COME IN.
##
WHO'S THAT ?
JUST SOME FRIENDS, DAVID.
IT GETS SO LONESOME NOW.
COME, WE CAN TALK IN HERE.
UH, CAN I GET YOU A DRINK ?
SURE.  VODKA MARTINI
STRAIGHT UP WITH AN OLIVE.
JUST LIKE
YOUR GRANDFATHER.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[ Jack ]  CUTE KID.
HOW DO I TELL HER I'M SUBLETTING
MY GRANDSON'S BODY ?
NOW THAT'S A FACE.
[ Jack ]
I LOOK EXACTLY LIKE I DID
20 YEARS AGO-- OLD.
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.
[ Sighs ]
THANKS, HONEY.
SORRY.
[ Giggles ]
WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY
IS DIFFICULT.
OH, DAVID,
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.
MADELYN, I'VE GONE THROUGH SOME
VERY STRANGE CHANGES RECENTLY.
THAT HAPPENS AT YOUR AGE.
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE TO BE INSIDE
ANOTHER PERSON'S BODY ?
- DO YOU ?
- I'M JUST BEGINNING
  TO FIND OUT.
OH.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.
I MEAN, ONE'S FIRST
SEXUAL EXPERIENCES...
CAN BE AWKWARD
AND DISAPPOINTING,
EVEN FRIGHTENING.
OH, DAVID, I'M SO GLAD
YOU CAME TO ME.
[ Jack ]
WAIT A MINUTE.  I HAVEN'T
EVEN TOLD HER IT'S ME YET.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
[ Purring ]
NOW YOU JUST RELAX, DAVID.
NO, NO,
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TOO.
WHAT ABOUT GRANDPA ?
OH, DAVID, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE.
I MEAN, JACK'S FUN.
HE'S GOT STYLE AND CHARM
AND MONEY.
I WILL BE WELL PROVIDED FOR
THANKS TO JACK,
BUT HE'S AN OLD MAN.
[ Jack ]
I'LL KILL HER.
A WOMAN MY AGE NEEDS PASSION
AND EXCITEMENT.
[ David Gasps ]
[ Panting ]
AND PHYSICAL AFFECTION.
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU AND GRANDPA NEVER--
[ Laughing ]
THAT'S A RATHER
PERSONAL QUESTION, DAVID.
OF COURSE NOT.  BELIEVE ME,
IT WAS STRICTLY PLATONIC.
[ Jack ]
PLATONIC ?
DAVID, WHAT'S WRONG ?
I THINK I'M HAVING
AN ANGINA ATTACK.
WHAT ?
YOU'RE LEAVING ?
##
I DON'T WANT
TO HIT A LADY, HORTON,
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND
HITTING HER.
[ Jack ]
PLATONIC.  PLATONIC.
PLATONIC, MY ASS.
[ Giggling, Sighing ]
[ Sighs ]
OOH !
OH, THANK YOU.
HE'S ADORABLE.
THANK YOU, MADAM.
WHERE'S THE BAR ?
RIGHT THERE.
MAKE MINE
A VODKA MARTINI...
STRAIGHT UP
W-WITH AN OLIVE.
WE MET THIS MORNING
AT HOPPY HENDERSON'S FUNERAL.
HOW IS MR. HENDERSON ?
DEAD.
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
[ Horton ]
SHE DOES SEEM QUITE YOUNG.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
MY SAYING SO, SIR, BUT
COULDN'T THIS BE DANGEROUS ?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HAVE SOME OXYGEN STANDING BY.
YES, SIR.
I'LL CALL YOU
IF SHE PASSES OUT.
JACK... PLEASE
COME BACK.
DO YOU MIND
IF I FINISH THIS CIGAR ?
YES.  COME BACK.
I CAN'T WAIT.
IT'S A DIRTY JOB,
BUT SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DO IT.
[ Jack ]
PLATONIC.
I TELL YOU,
THIS FEELS GOOD, CHARLIE.
A NICE LAZY DAY,
LETTING THE SUN
WARM YOUR FACE...
AND WATCHING
THE WORLD GO BY.
HEY, GUYS,
LET ME ROLL A FEW.
OKAY, GENTLEMEN, STEP ASIDE.
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW THIS IS DONE.
MAYBE YOU'D RATHER BE
HANG GLIDING OR SOMETHING.
MAYBE I SHOULD
TELL THEM.
SURE.  WHY NOT ?
WHAT'S A FEW MORE PEOPLE
IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ?
OKAY, OKAY,
IT'S MY TURN HERE.
HERE WE GO.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Poker Chips Clinking ]
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
DOWN AND DIRTY.
[ Laughing ]
POKER ?
DUH.
WHAT'S WITH THE CLOWN SUIT,
WATSON ?
[ Frat Brother ]
ISN'T HE NEGLECTING
HIS SCHOOLWORK ?
[ Laughing ]
[ Russ ]
THAT'S RIGHT, WATSON.
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE
AT THE TYPEWRITER ?
YOU BOYS DON'T REALLY
WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THAT SUBJECT, DO YOU ?
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO PLAY,
JUST SAY SO.
I GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO
THAN STAND HERE AND LISTEN
TO YOUR CHATTER.
YOU GOT THE CASH ?
YOU KNOW HOW
TO PLAY OKLAHOMA ?
FIVE CARD DRAW WITH A ROLL ?
[ Snickering ]
I COULD BLUFF YOU GUYS
INTO THINKING THAT
I WAS A REAL MARK,
BUT I KNOW HOW TO PLAY
OKLAHOMA...
AND ROOSTER BACK...
AND NICKEL HAYRIDE...
AND ALASKAN PULL...
AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS
THAT YOU BOYS HAVE PROBABLY
NEVER HEARD OF.
THE FACT IS, GENTLEMEN,
IF I SIT DOWN AT THAT TABLE
WITH ALL OF YOU NOW,
I'M GONNA CLEAN YOU ALL OUT.
[ Laughing ]
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES
TO PLAYING CARDS,
YOU'RE JUST A BUNCH
OF KIDS TO ME.
YOU SEE, THAT'S THE CANDY,
AND YOU'RE THE BABIES,
 AND I--
I'M GONNA TAKE IT FROM YOU.
HAVE A SEAT.
GET AWAY FROM ME.
ALL RIGHT.
[ David ]
THAT'S A REAL POKER FACE, J.P.
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GOT SOMETHING
CRAWLING UP YOUR LEG.
[ Sighs ]
[ Frat Brother ]
NO, THAT'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE.
I'M OUT.
I'M IN.
JUST YOU AND ME, DWEEB.
AND, UH,
[ Sighs ]
I THINK I'LL BE, UH,
BE RAISING.
I'M IN.
THAT'S ABOUT $500.
LET'S SEE IT.
I'M GOOD FOR IT.
THAT SHOULD BE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
UNLESS YOU'RE NOT TOO SURE
ABOUT YOUR HAND.
HOW ABOUT YOUR FEET ?
WHAT ?
FORGET ABOUT THESE CARDS.
WE NEVER
HAVE TO LOOK AT 'EM.
LET'S DOUBLE THE BET.
A THOUSAND DOLLARS
SAYS THAT I BEAT YOU
AT THE TRACK FINALS.
[ Onlookers Gasping,
  Murmuring ]
YOU'RE ON.
I WAS BLUFFING.
[ Laughing ]
YOU WERE BLUFFING.
[ Onlooker ]
OH !
[ Onlookers Laughing ]
[ Russ, David ]
THE TRACK.
SO WHEN THE BET
CAME AROUND TO HARRY,
HARRY HELD UP
HIS LAST DOLLAR AND HE SAYS,
"HEY, GUYS, NO MORE BUMPS.
THE BUCK STOPS HERE."
HE FIRST SAID THAT
AT A POKER GAME ?
THAT'S RIGHT.
I WAS REMINDED OF THAT STORY
AFTER PLAYING A FEW HANDS
OF POKER MYSELF RECENTLY.
BUT I THOUGHT THAT CAME OUT
OF HIS SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN
IN MISSOURI.
SEE, THAT COMES FROM GETTING
ALL YOUR INFORMATION
OUT OF BOOKS.
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
DROPPING THE BOMB ON HIROSHIMA ?
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN--
THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION
OF HIS CAREER.
HE AGONIZED OVER IT.
THEN NAGASAKI.
THAT WAS A LITTLE EASIER.
HE'D DONE IT ONCE ALREADY.
AFTER THAT
HE STARTED GETTING
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.
HE WANTED TO DROP IT
ON A FEW OTHER PLACES.
SWITZERLAND, ONCE,
WHEN HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH HIS WATCH.
I HAD TO TALK HIM
OUT OF IT.
[ Chuckles ]
UH, YOU'D BETTER NOT USE THAT.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY,
AND, IF IT EVER GETS OUT, WHO
KNOWS HOW THE SWISS WILL REACT.
MORE COFFEE,
DAVID ?
OH, NO, THANK YOU, RITA.
I'M SORRY,
I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE YOU.
RITA, THIS IS ROBIN.
- ROBIN, RITA.
- HI.
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.
HAVE YOU BEEN IN HERE BEFORE ?
[ Robin ]  I'VE BEEN IN HERE
WITH MY MOTHER A FEW TIMES.
I THOUGHT SO.
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HER.
[ Jack ]  LOOK AT THIS.
THE CLAWS ARE OUT.
EASY, GIRLS.
THERE'S AT LEAST
TWO PORTIONS HERE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE PICK THIS UP AGAIN
FRIDAY NIGHT ?
UH, I'M SORRY.
YOU PROBABLY HAVE PLANS
TO GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS
OR RUSS OR SOMETHING.
I WASN'T THINKING.
[ Jack ]
LISTEN TO ME.
I SOUND LIKE DAVID.
NO, I DON'T HAVE
ANY PLANS, BUT...
DAVID, NOBODY STUDIES
ON FRIDAYS.
MAYBE WE COULD, UM,
GO TO A CLUB OR SOMETHING,
HAVE SOME FUN.
"WE" ?
YOU AND ME.
[ Jack ]
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME ?
I CAN'T TALK.
COME ON, LIPS,
YOU CAN DO IT.
MOVE.
I'D LOVE TO.
GREAT.
IT'S A DATE.
GREAT.
[ Jack ]
YOWZA !
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN GRANDPA'S OFFICE ?
I'M RUNNING THE SHIP NOW.
[ Jack ]
IT'S A MUTINY.
HERE.
RUN THIS DOWN TO SHIPPING.
HOW CAN YOU DELIVER
THIS MANY UNITS
BY THE END OF THE MONTH ?
COME OVER HERE.
I'VE DESIGNED A SIMPLE WAY
TO RETOOL THE LINE...
THAT'LL INCREASE
OUR PRODUCTIVITY BY 28%...
WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE IN COST.
YOU BYPASSED THE MOLDING
INJECTION FUNCTION.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY
TAKING AN INTEREST IN WHAT
GOES ON AROUND HERE.
IT'S AMAZING.
DAVID,
PLEASE DON'T LIGHT THAT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
SHOW THIS TO GRANDPA ?
I TRIED, TIME AND AGAIN,
AND HE ALWAYS
IGNORED ME.
A LONG TIME AGO
HE STUCK ME IN SALES
AND FORGOT ABOUT ME.
I DON'T BELONG IN SALES.
I BELONG IN R AND D.
NOW I CAN FINALLY DO
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING
ALL ALONG.
I WISH THIS COULD'VE
HAPPENED DIFFERENTLY.
I'D LIKE HIM TO SEE ME...
LIKE THIS.
I WISH HE'D JUST
GIVEN ME THE CHANCE.
GET THIS TO SHIPPING,
AND THEN GO STRAIGHT
TO THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT.
THEY GOT A MOUNTAIN
OF FILING THAT'S PILED UP
SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST.
HEY, UH, SWEETHEART,
CALL AN OFFICE BOY.
[ Shouting, Laughing ]
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
SETTLE DOWN, LISTEN UP.
NOW, WE'RE HERE
TO DISCUSS THE ANNUAL
CELEBRATION AND RALLY...
THAT'LL TAKE PLACE ON THE EVE
OF THE INTERCOLLEGIATE MEET.

UM, WELL...
WHEN SOMEONE BUILDS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
THEY DON'T CARE
HOW IT LOOKS TO THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE AROUND HERE...
OR THE KIDS
WHO PLAY IN THIS LOT.
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE
WITH THIS BIG, UGLY WALL...
IN THEIR FACES...
EVERY DAY.
I SAW THIS WALL,
AND I THOUGHT IT COULD
USE A COAT OF PAINT.
[ Jack ]  SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD REASON TO ME, DAVID.

[ Crowd Continues

OH, NO.

OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE DOING, CHARLIE.
THEY'RE KILLING
THEIR OWN SON.
AND THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY SURPRISE THEY'VE
GOT WAITING FOR THEM.
I REWROTE MY WILL.
I GAVE MADELYN
HALF OF WATSON DIALS.
IF I GO, THAT BITCH
WILL RUN THE PLACE.
"THAT BITCH" ?
SINCE WHEN ?
SINCE SHE TRIED TO SEDUCE
MY GRANDSON, A.K.A. ME.
CHRIST, CHARLIE,
IF THIS HAPPENS,
I'VE SCREWED ARNOLD,
I'VE SCREWED DAVID,
I'VE SCREWED MYSELF.
THAT'S A LOT OF SCREWING
FOR A GUY YOUR AGE.
THAT WASN'T DAD.
IT WAS JUST HIS BODY.
I KNOW.
IT WAS
THE ONLY DECISION.
OH, OF COURSE IT WAS.
HE'D SUFFERED ENOUGH.
GOD KNOWS,
HIS SOUL DESERVES PEACE.
SUDDENLY,
SHE'S MOTHER TERESA.

WITHOUT YOU,
IT'S JUST A FACTORY.
I'M EVEN GONNA MISS THE SMELL

[ Jack On Intercom ]
THEN I'VE GOT SOME
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.
MY GOD.
DAD.
WE'VE GOT SOME TALKING
TO DO, ARNIE.
WE CAN COMMUNICATE
THROUGH THIS ?
- THEY PULLED THE PLUG !
- I'VE GOT GOOD BATTERIES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY OFFICE ?
BUT THEN AGAIN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN SALES ?
YOU DON'T BELONG THERE.
LOOK, ARNIE, I KNOW
I'VE BEEN TOUGH ON YOU.
I HAVEN'T LISTENED
TO ANY OF YOUR IDEAS,
AND YOU HAD SOME GOOD ONES.
I JUST GET
A LITTLE TOO FULL
OF MYSELF SOMETIMES.
I'M SORRY.
LET'S WORK TOGETHER
FROM NOW ON.  OKAY ?
DO ME A FAVOR, ARNIE.
DON'T DO
THE SAME THING TO DAVID
THAT I DID TO YOU.
I'M NOT.
DID YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF
WHETHER DAVID WANTS
TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT ?
DID YOU EVER ASK DAVID ?
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE MIGHT WANT TO BE--
OH, HELL, I DON'T KNOW.
AN ARTIST.

OKAY.
I'M GONNA PUT YOU

WHAT ?
YOU CAN PLAY
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S
LITTER BOX.

- OH, YOU WOULDN'T !
WELL !
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
YOU'VE BEEN
A LOVELY COMPANION,

IT DID, SIR.

YOU'LL REGRET THIS--
NO !

KICK ASS, WATSON.

[ Whistle Blowing ]
ALL RIGHT, COME ON !
GET THOSE REARS IN GEAR !

YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT !
WATSON.
YOU'VE COME
A LONG WAY, KID.
TWO WEEKS AGO,
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
STAY ON YOUR FEET.
GO OUT THERE
AND GET 'EM.
HELLO, KID.
HI, GRANDPA.
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.
WELL, 18
IS A CONFUSING AGE.
I DIDN'T QUALIFY
FOR THIS MEET.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
DID YOU DO IT ?
WHAT ?
PULL SOME STRINGS ?
NO, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
I KNOW TRACK DOESN'T
MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU,
BUT THIS RACE MEANS A LOT,
IF ONLY TO PROVE TO YOURSELF
THAT YOU CAN BEAT RUSS DEACON.
YOU'RE STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK, DAVID.
DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW.
I JUST DO.
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU CAN DO IT...
IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF HALF
AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE IN YOU.
I COULDN'T HOLD A CANDLE
TO YOU, GRANDPA.
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE,
LISTEN TO THE CROWD.
THEY BELIEVE IN YOU TOO.
THEY'LL BE CHEERING
FOR YOU, DAVID, FOR YOU.
NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A WATSON--
BECAUSE YOU'RE DAVID WATSON.
THANKS, GRANDPA.
HERE.
I THOUGHT THESE MIGHT HELP.
I WAS WEARING THOSE
WHEN I WON THE MEET IN '28.
[ Spectators Applauding,
  Cheering ]
I THINK THEY'LL FIT YOU.
THANKS, KID.

[ Spectators Continue
  Shouting, Cheering ]

DAVID, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING THAT...
MAYBE YOU AND I
COULD GET TOGETHER LATER ON...
AND WE COULD GO OVER
SOME TRUMAN TOGETHER.
MY GRANDFATHER KNEW HIM.
[ Laughing ]
I KNOW.

YOU WERE WONDERFUL.
BYE.
GRANDPA !
CAN YOU DO ME
A REALLY BIG FAVOR ?
WOULD YOU TELL ME

DAVID.
