Introduction
Who am I?
City Hunter is my nickname
fighting crimes is the game
I work alone and I'm a private detective.
My sidekick comes alone also
But, I'm better at kung fu and much cuter
smarter too.
I'm taller as well.
He's too humble.
We're best friends.
We have been through a lot.
Invincible!
One time when he was alone
he get sleep though
Beat.
You're shot!
Are you okay?
How do you feel?
How would you feel if you're hit by 20 shots?
Hey, you have to try,
promise you won't die.
There is one thing...
Take care of my cousin Kaori,
I'd appreciate it.
Ok, because you're a pal, I'll do it.
It can't be any worse of getting shot.
One more thing, 
never seduce her.
I swear on it
Ok, I can die in peace.
So sad...
On that day forward,
Kaori became my only family.
One thing I had overlook however,
was in how quickly little girls grow up.
One second they're cute innocent youngsters,
than you turn your back on them for a moment and...
Not fair.
Why did I ever swear
that I wouldn't seduce Kaori?
I bet if he was still alive
my old friend would understand if I did?
No.
Because of the promise I made,
Kaori has never been more than my assistant.
And I never suspected 
how she truly felt about me.
Until one day...
Why doesn't he answer?

She likes to eat.
She has seven meals daily.
And she misbehave very bad.
Then, when she wakes up,
she wants to go out.
Tongue out, paws up,
back and forth.
She's useless, I'd give her away
but I feel too sorry for her.
Impossible!
Do it.

Day dreaming?
What do you care?
As to why I brought you here,
I'm Mr. Imamura, honor of Imamura newspapers.
My daughter Kiyoko.
She lost her mother early,
and I brought the girl alone.
She's an only child
I met a woman last year, we're in love with 
each other and we intend to wed.
Kiyoko coudn't stand the idea
and ran away.
After a very discreet prowl,
we learn she was staying in Hong Kong.
I suppose you'll pay for her return.
You'll want to use any force,
or to harm her.
He is extremely gentle to the pretty ladies.
I know.
But have you seen her anywhere?
Perhaps by the shirt.
Where?
Would you wander a surprise?
What skateboarding are you saying?
What park?
Olsen Park?
Got it.
Ever been on the ocean?
Ok.
A voyage at sea and all around stars.
Yeah, you know. Stay in touch now, will ya?
Were you saying something?
You never hear a thing I say.

I'll go to Olsen Park.
You check the galleries.
Go ahead.
Oh, and don't slam the door.
If you see her, call.
You drive me nuts!
That's it. Great. Like your car?
Well, I don't like it.
Think you got the right to the whole road?
Yeah, that's right. Back off!
Who cares about your birthday?
So when you and me are going out?
We aren't going out.
Just forget that.
Come on, we would go to disco.
We'll go dancing another time.
Sorry.
I'm in good luck.
I found you pretty fast.

No, once I tied you 
I can give the rest.
Let's go for it, come on.
Whatever you girls want.

Ay.
Wow.
Beautiful room.
Put away the luggage.
Gimme a hand.
You fall again?
I always lose my balance.
Yeah. Up you go.
You know what?
I like living in style.
I heard this boat is filled
with lots of single guys.
What if one came along
who is rich and just perfect?
Hey, what is your mission?
I provide you with the cover.
I forgot.
Is there a reward if we solve this case?
Sure there is.
If our information about the gang
robbing the boat is correct and we stop them.
We get our money once they're caught?
I was sent to investigate 
by my superiors.
To see if the information is right.
Did you bring me a gun?
You're a thing.
Watch it. Don't hit me.
You're late.
We got caught in traffic.
Hey, what a beautiful room.
This is gonna do perfectly.
You bastard. I'm gonna warn you once.
Don't be late again.
Don't get uptight.
Just relax.
Trying to enjoy ourselves.
Till midnight.
If having your mouth full
won't attract a lot of men.
I'm hungry.
I coudn't wait.
Am I at a convention 
or is my hearing gone bad?
Food.
Hey, there's that cute guy.
He looks like he's lost, doesn't he?
He's barely human.
In fact he's repulsive.
Hi!
Be you discreet!
Embarassed?
He is reputed to be an 
sex feat.
I never met a man who wasn't.
He is always flerting.
You need some training.
No money at all.
Hamburger, come back.
Nice, huh?
Yeah.
Just wait.
They'll be ours.
That way.
Come on.
Sorry.
But why? You know that we're supposed
to be lovers. It's written in the stars at above.
And will vow never to let the name
of City Hunter be spoken. Never again.
You know that he'll come to find me.
He can't. How could even get here?
He gonna fly?
We're at sea!
Kaori.
Hurry, protect me.
Move and die.
Who is that?
Where are your six girlfriends?
Couldn't they come?
Are you talking?
I can't hear one thing.
You know him.
My cousin has gone away.
Oh, it's scary.
Not a single thing is getting in.
You're absolutely right.
You refuse to hear.
Will I return?
No more flerting.
You can't sleep with other girls.
And you treat me like a queen.
I can't hear a single thing.
Please repeat it.
Bastard. You're being so cruel.
Watch it, buddy.
If my cousin weren't here,
I would put you on the floor.
Cowards quake when they face the 
Dragon's Claw.

Banker has nine.
Banker wins.
Alright!
Nine, won.
Didn't I tell you?
He is a winner.
Just you watch.
You stay with the banker.
Wait, it doesn't make any sense at all.
Why staying in separate rooms?
You know that all great love affairs
must be given an opportunity.
And ours is no different.
My room, or better yours?
Alright, you sleep in my room.
Alright.
And I'll stay in yours.
Oh, she is gone.
But, no.
I will still her for returnity.
It doesn't matter. A soul as pure as mine
will never feel despirited.
I'm gonna make love to you, baby.
Cos I'm so potent.
Potent. I'm a potent of man.
I'm gonna show you all my charms.
You're Jane and I'm your Tarzan.
I'll possess her.

Not even close.
You bastard.
I'm something, ain't I?
Yeah?
Goodbye...
Hunter.
Are you alright?
Wounded?
I'm just bruised.
May I lift you?
I'm mad.
Kaori.
- Were you hurt?
- Very badly.
- I see you ok.
- You were hold that coward.
Let me pick you up.
All better?
It's over now.
Kaori, we're all set.
Oh. Where'd Kiyoko go, Hunter?
Where'd she gone?
Be right back.
Wait a second.
Remarkable.
Kiyoko, please don't go away.
No, I won't.
I won't leave ever again.
And I'll do anything you want.
Anything?
I want a bowl of noodles.
City Hunter, are you ok?
Indeed. 
Again, you have our gratitude.
My pleasure.
Sit down.
City Hunter,
I would like to speak
with no one else present.
Don't be long.
I guess I'll leave.
Thank you.
Let's wander out.
Hold my calls.
I want no interruptions.
Sir, I'm impressed.
My daughter has returned to me.
And she is changed for the better, 
thanks to you.
Don't mention it.
You know you really should date her.
I think you'll make 
a very fine husband.
You'll make an excellent son of mine
and naturally when I retire my daughter 
and her family will inherit everything.
If I am choosing who marries
my daughter then
of course he'll be a wealthy man.
Well, can I assume you're in love?
No.
Why not?
Well, I can't do that.
I don't want one.
I want them all.
No one would work for me.
I figured you wanna know
your friends are going.
It's no big deal.
Thank you, sir.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, watch out now. Be quickly.
I charge interest.
Where'd that girl go?
- Outside.
- Outside?
Nice perfume.
How sweet.
Kaori, where are you going?
It's for you.
Kaori, what's wrong with you?
You rat.
Kaori will be what?
Your maid?
I don't think you understand.
You heard and you think I said yes.
I didn't.
Alright?
Of course not.
City Hunter.
My, my.
Hi.
You look bored.
You bet.
You want to go along for a ride?
Alright.
Wow. What is that?
You want?
Thanks.
City Hunter.
I was born lucky.
