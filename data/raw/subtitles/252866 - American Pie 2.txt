[Girl] Are you sure you
don't wanna go to my room?
[Boy] No. Why?
My roommate's
already moved out.
We'll be all alone.
All right.
The door is locked.
Okay, Jim, relax. Relax.
Okay, yeah, sure.
No strings attached, okay?
It's just friendly
good-byesex.
Yeah, right. Right,
right, right, right.
Yeah, right. Right,
right, right, right.
Uh, yeah, but you see,
it's just that, um,
we've never even had
friendly hello sex.
So doyou not
wanna do this?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, I do. Yeah.
No, I definitely do.
Uh, it's just that,
you see, this is actually
my first time.
Well, not my first.
It's my first time,
uh, since my...
first time.
So, technically,
that's my second time.
And l-- I don't--
I don't wanna suck at it.
So if I'm not up to par,
performance-wise--
Jim, this isn't exactly
a turn-on.
I mean, girls like a guy
with confidence.
Hey, I'm confident.
Oh, I am-- I'm absolutely,
totally confident.
Oh?
Yeah.
Let's get naked.
Okay.
Seems likejust yesterday
my dad picked me up after
my first year at college.
- Mm-hmm.
- We popped a couple of beers,
and he said,
"Now, you're a man."
And today I get to say
the same thing to my son.
Honey, your speeches
embarrass him.
So, try and do what the kids
say, and just... be cool.
I think I bring new meaning
to the word "cool," honey.
That's his dormitory
up ahead.
Turn over.
Okay.
Ow.
[ Groans ]
Can't bring alcohol
in the dorms.
Oh, uh, good.
Thankyou, uh, Matt.
I'm just here to surprise
my sonim.
Now pin my leg up.
What?
Pin my leg up,
like this.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
May be you can help
me out, you know.
Okay.
Is that the one?
No.
There!
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Oh, oh, oh, okay!
[ Shudders ]
Now I remember.
I didn't do this foryou.
Thanks, dude.
[Dad]
Where's my big guy?
Oh, my God!
Oh, no.
Hey--
[ Screams ]
-esus!
-im, we got here a little early.
- Dad, get out!
- I'll wait in the car.
Go, Dad!
Oh, my-- Geez.
Was that your dad?
Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.
- For your own edification,
son, I just--
I'm not embarrassed.
- I am!
- It's a perfectly
normal thing for two--
- Dad, what are you doing?
- This is human nature.
Human nature at its best.
Son, everybody does it.
Your mother and l--
Well, not so much anymore.
Got your favorite.
Oh, my God! They're fucking!
- No! No!
- Honey, honey, listen. No, no.
I'm gonna take her--
Pleasejust go!
Actually,
ifyou wouldn't mind.
Honey-- I'll take her
to the car.
[ Gasps ]
[ Gasps ]
Hi, Mama.
What?
- Natalie!
- I'm Jim 's dad.
You must be the parents
ofthis young lady.
I'm sorry I didn't get her name,
but hopefully my son did...
because I have not been
here the whole time.
because I have not been
here the whole time.
[Man]
Natalie, get dressed!
- Beer?
- [Man] Avert your eyes!
Turn around!
[Natalie] Thanks,Jim.
You don't believe in locks?
Oh, my God.

Heya, fuckface.
- Mornin', dude.
- ome on, Ozzy.
It's show time.
Ozzy, before you go to Ann Arbor
to pick up Heather, I wanna
show you what you're missing.
See what they are today, dude.
See what they are today.
Okay, here wego.
Moment oftruth.
Ooh!
There's little hearts
on her panties!
Super.
There's little hearts
on her panties! ome on, look,
you pussy. Look.
What the fuck, man?
ome on!
I'm disappointed in you. Here
it is, the end ofour freshman
year and you screwed one girl.
One.
[ huckles ]
You're a disgrace
to men everywhere.
Look at the Stifmeister.
I got laid 23 times
this year,
and I'm not counting
the hummer I got in
the library stacks, baby.
All right, here's a new idea
foryou, Stifler, okay?
You find a girl.
You two become best friends.
You don't bother counting
how many times you have sex
with each other.
- You just laugh at the people
that do count.
- Here's a new idea foryou.
I'll get you a spoon
so you can eat my ass.
Okay, people.
Notebooks closed.
Let's get this exam rolling.
Holy shit, dude.
We got an exam today?
You kiddin' me?
Bullshit.
[ Scoffs ]
Yes! I'm never
even gonna think about
political science again.
Hey. How'd you do?
Oh, fine.
Yeah?
I Can't believe I'm doing this
summer abroad thing. Last thing
I need is more classes.
You're gonna have
a great time.
[Boy] Hello, summer!
Did that exam blow or what?
Yeah, it sucked.
Ozzy!
Kev, what's up, man?
How are you?
Good. Put your
party hat on.
Wegot 12 weeks
of immortality ahead.
Yes, sir!
Weird.
Ah, the one thatgot away,
huh, son?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, evidently you two
made quite the handsome
couple on the lnternet.
Oh, I didn't see it.
It, uh, was brought up
at a P.T.A. meeting.
Anyway, my point is,
these little sexual debacles
should not get you down,
because you know what?
It happens to the best
of us. In fact,
the first time your mother
and l... got together,
[ Low Moan ]
I used a condom.
Well, she referred to it
as "shrink wrapping."
[ huckles ]
But I got over it.
Anyway, keep your chin up.
You keep plugging...
and, uh, good things
will happen.
Good to have you home, son.
It's good to be home, Dad.
[Kevin]
It'sgonna be nice to hit
Stifler's tonight afterexams.
Did you get through 'em?
There's the mystery man!
[Kevin]
Finch, howareyou?
Kevin. Konichiwa.
James. Konichiwa. Konichiwa.
It'sapanese.
It means "hello."
Hello.
- Finch, what happened to Latin?
- I met aapanese girl
at the art museum.
hanged majors. Wanted to
understand all those things
she was moaning.
-You got laid in an art museum?
-The Met.
- Oh, and the Guggenheim
with Francesca.
- The Guggenheim?
And then my social-psych
professor in Baskin-Robbins.
- All right, enough, Finch.
- But I'll tell you, none ofthese women...
even compare to--
[ All ]
Stifler's mom.
Stifler's mom is a goddess.
How about some more
of Stifmeister's
collegiate concoction?
This thing is like
halfalcohol. You'rejust
trying to get me drunk.
[ huckles ]
Mary, would I do that?
My name's hristy.
hristy, right, right.
Beautiful name.
Like it matters.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey.
Howdy-howdy,
fuckin' partners!
Johnny ., how's it going?
Good to see you.
Oh, looks like someone
gained a freshman 1 5.
This'll help.
You're an asshole.
[DoorbelIRings]
Missed you too.
All right, everybody

Ladies.
Fellas! How's it going?
The keg's back there

I'm really happy to see you.
All right.
You stupid fuck.
Hey. Hey, are you

- Yes, I am.
- Well, thank you for throwing
this awesome party, man.
- No problem.
- Yeah, the cops bust
all our parties now.
Well, I put the word out...
so high-school chicks
would come.
Just 'cause you fuckers don't
have dicks doesn't make it right
for you to be here, you know.
- Uh, hey, man,
could I askyou a question?
- Sure, son.
Is it true that
Paul Finch nailed your mom?
Sons of bitches.
My mom's a saint!
Go sucksome dick!
Hey, arlos,ason.
What's going on?
Keg's back on the deck.
Hey, how's lowa State?
Did you see those fuckers
I had to boot outta here?
Yup. Back at Stifler's.
It's just like old times.
One difference.
We're college men now.
Some ofthese girls
are from the grade below us.
I might actually have a chance.
Hey, I rememberyou.
Oh, do you now?
You're that guy who blew
his load on the lnternet.
[Both Laughing]
Splat. "Oh, wait,
Nadia, don't go." Splat.
Pathetic.
Loser.
It's exactly like
old times.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you.
I'll call you
when I get in, okay?
Go have fun.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
[Jim]
lcan't believe
those two girls, Kevin.
[Kevin]
Jim, it'snot a big deal.
No. Yeah.
They toyed with
my emotions.
Hello. Hello.
See?
There's other girls.

to worry about, man.
Hey,essica's here.

Hey, Vic, how are you?
What's up?
I'm okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
That's good.
It's good to hear.
Yeah, you too.
Wow.
Well, this is about
as comfortable as
a high colonic in Tijuana.
And I would know.
Okay.
I'm gonna get a drink.
She's right.
Why is this so weird?
Actually, l-l have no idea.
See, I knew it.
I knew you'd be mature
about this.
You know, and we could
still be friends, right?
Yeah.
I miss you, Kev.
Whoa.
Friends, right?
Yeah, right.
I mean, I know you said
friends and l-- I just--
I'm sorry.
I was-- It wasjust...
an oldhabit--
a friendkiss.
- Are you sure?
- Vic, why wouldn't I wanna
be friends with you?
Look, we'll--
we'll just do this, okay?
Friends.
Friends.
Ozzy! Myman!
There he is.
Shake off your chains
of monogamy.
You're a free man.
I don't think so.
You know I'll never turn
over to the dark side.
Dumb ass.
What happened to the 'nova
I knew in high school?
'Nova, as in asanova?
The guy who had
all the moves?
Yeah, he was an idiot.
Yeah, but he was
my idiot.
Hey, everyone!
Listen up!
'Nova's back, baby!
And he's taking the locks
off his cock!
Ozzy, I'm lobbing you

Pull out your bat
and take a swing.

Okay, guys, we went through

Finch got a black eye
and Stifler got six stitches.
'ause you fuckin' bit me!
- You touch me, I bite.
- You two relax and shake hands.
Shake this!
Hey.
Finch.
I need a drink.
Why is everybody
taking a piss right now?
The line's too long.
I ain't gonna make it, man.
You'll be okay. Relax.
Hey, bro. Hey, man,
you're the guy who boned
Stifler's mom.
Hey, you are a god.
Holy shit, dude.
If I didn't have to hold my dick

I would shake your hand.
I'm honored, guys.
Don't leave.
You must teach me.
How? How?
Oh, look what I found,
hristy.
Oh, what a coincidence.
I've been saving this
for a special occasion...

just like you.
You're so sweet.
That's what they say.
Oh, weird.
Oh, my God.
I spilled some on you.
May be I should
mop that up.
Thanks.
No problem.
Whoa! Whoa, hey.
Take it slow. ome on.

Now, you may be intoxicated.
Oh, yeah.
Are you certain that you

Hey, don't count
your chickens, buster.
I'm just playing
by the rules, baby.
I make the rules.
That's a pretty good
fucking rule.
Dude, the line's too long.
I'll never make it.
It's gotta happen now.
Get my back.
Go, bro.
Iamp it off.
Hello.

Isn't this the Stifler house?
Yeah. You ever seen
Mrs. Stifler?
Oh, what a "milf."
Oh, yeah?
[Jim]
Okay, now,
do these high school kids
think that we're cool because
they're at a college party,
or are we those weird older guys
that try to hang out with high
school kids when we come home?
No way. We're definitely
not those guys.
[Boy] Cops!
- ops!
- [Man] Allright!
Break it up.
Party's over.
Let'sgo.
Ostreicher, Meyers.
- Welcome back.
- Where's Steve Stifler?
I got peed on.
[Kevin]
No, man,
Stifler'sgotshut down.
We can't party
anywhere anymore.
And things are--
Getting weird?
Yeah, a little bit.
First summer back
from college.
Yep, things are gonna
get weirder.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Well, times change, people change.
It's just what happens,
you know.
Kev, listen.
Go into my old room.
My friendsandlknew
that it was up to us
to stick together.
You remember my first
collegesummer? We rented
that lake house in GrandHarbor.
We treated every day out there
like it was a post-promparty.
Hellofa time. We cappedit
all off with a massive blowout.
Best ever.
It waslegendary.
My advice is do that.
Bythe end of the summer,
you'regonna see
the bigpicture.

It's long distance.
Who?
Nadia! Nadia!
What?
New York. She's on-- Hello.
Yes, dear, he's right here.
Here. Wait.
Now remember--
Yes, I am sure to go
see the Lion King.
Right. And don't ride
the subway after midnight.
Okay.
I know they've done
wonderful things with that city,
but, you know, for me--
- Dad!
- He's right-- Hang on.
Hey-- Hey, Nadia.
Jim!
How was college?
ollege was excellent.
Yeah. Yeah, it was--
it was really excellent.
You have not forgotten
about me, have you?
No. I, uh--
Absolutely not.
I definitely didn't.
Good, because guess what?
I'm coming to see you
at the end ofsummer.
I hope you're ready
for me...
because I have not forgotten
about you either, you sexy boy.
[Jim] Shit.
[Finch]Jim, you can
eat hot dogs tomorrow.
No, no, Finch,
it's not the hot dogs.
Nadia called me
this morning.
She's coming here
at the end ofthe summer
and she wants to see me.
- Oh, that's killer.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.
No, not "good thing."
Not "killer."
I'll never be able
to do it.
Nadia is gonna be expecting
filet mignon.
Okay, and all I'm gonna
be able to give her...
is rump roast.
Aw, come on.
Jim, you've had experience
since Nadia.
Ah, yes, you would be
referring to...
the flute-fetish band geek
that made me her bitch and
then ditched me after prom.
Yes, that's
great experience.
That's the one.
Ah, you just gotta
find the right girl,imbo.
Brings it all together.
[Finch]
lhadthe right woman.
Shejust sells her cottage
and takes off
to parts unknown.
Oh, my romantic life
has past its peak.
Take me out to the pasture
and shoot me.
Super start to
a super summer, fellas.
Welcome home.
Guys, I got it.
Packyour bags.
- For what?
- We're moving to the lake.
We're gonna be the shit.
Everybody on the beach
is gonna know us.
Plenty of opportunities
to practice for Nadia.
Throw a huge party at the end
ofthe summer to cap it all off.
Dude, that's a great idea.
That way we'll be able
to welcome Heather back...
and we'll be able to prepare
for Nadia's big arrival.
This is it.
This is my summer of love.
Just thought I'd say
good-bye to you animals.
Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
How are you, sir?
Hey.
- All packed up I see.
- Yeah, we're all set, Dad.
Don't worry, okay?
I'llbe fine.
ome on and give
your old man a hug.
- Keep it real, homies.
- You too, sir.
Have a good summer.
All right, let's go.
I've been running these numbers
here and I don't think the four
ofus can afford this place.
- Not on summerjobs.
- Well, I kind ofthought ofthat.
So... Invited someone else.
Oh, yeah! The Stifmeister's
coming back to Grand Harbor!
Deck the halls!
Bye-bye, Great Falls!
Wipe my ass
and lick my balls!
It's Stifler time, baby!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[Rock]
Stifler, ifyou're gonna
be living with us
you gotta behave yourself.
All right, you and Finch just
stay out ofeach other's way.
Kevin, Stifler's stench
is unavoidable.
Finch, fist yourself.
[ huckles ]
That's right, baby.
We're here.
Yeah, baby, we're here!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

[ Chanting ]
Will you idiots tell me
what this fucker's doin'?
[ Gasps ]
Don't touch me
while I'm tantric.
"Tantric"?
What the fuck is tantric?
It's a Buddhist discipline.
You learn to channel
your body's energies--
your chakras.
When you can do that,
you can have sex for hours,
even days.
-And this stuff's for real?
-It's been around for centuries.
With tantra you can make
an entire session ofsex...
feel like one giant orgasm.
eventually, you can
sustain that feeling
by meditating.
Well, may be you can
teach me sometime?
Very doubtful.
True.
ome on,im.
You can't possibly
be that bad.
Oh, no?
No way.
Well, I guess there's only
one person that really
knows for sure, huh?
Oh, yeah?
Where's she thissummer?
[Whistle Blowing]
[ Marching Band ]
Hey, areyou here for
the mid-session performance?
Guests go in the amphitheater.
You can't be here.
Do you know where I
could find Michelle Flaherty?
Guests bring food.
Food attracts animals.
This one time,
a bearcame, andthen the bear
hadto be destroyed,
which means they shot it
in the head with a rifle
and killed it and it died.
You must know Michelle.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

Let me guess.
A bear came.

It's like you know
all our stories.
Oh. Was that a question?
I don't know. May be.
Do you wanna answer it
anyway?
Michelle, um,
I left you like, uh--
Iike three messages
after prom.
Really?
You didn't think
I was weird because ofthe way
I acted that night?
Weird, no.
Surprising, yes.
I get nasty when I'm horny.
That's kind of
why I'm here.
Um, you remember,
was I any good...
that-that night?
Oh, wow. Geez.
How could I forget?
You sucked.
You didn't know what
the hell you were doing.
But wasn't it fun even though
you were so terrible?
I'm sorry. "Terrible"?
I've had worse.
Oh.
Oh, sorry. I--
I-l could give you
some pointers ifyou want.
Really?

You're all right. Here we go.
You know you're not supposed

Everyone's supposed to be in
the amphitheater. All right.
ome on.
[ Mumbling ]
It's piss-poor to be this late.
I'm very angry right now.
You can tell by the tone
of my voice I'm angry.
I'm pissed off is what I am.
Here theyare.
Cut 'em off.
Go, go.
Wait a minute.
Are you Petey?
Petey?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Petey! Well,
that explains everything.
All right.
Well, it's always something
with these kids. Go!
Petey, we arejust so thrilled
to have you. None of my kids
are at your caliber.
Watch that. But we arejust
so overjoyed to have someone
with your kind oftalent here.
Oh, great.
[ Boy ]
Here you go.
That's great. Oh, look at this.
Your old best friend.
ome on. Move.
I know it's not yours,
but you are going to make
beautiful music.
Here we go.
This is fantastic.
I'm very excited.
You just own this
and break a leg.
All right,

[CrowdApplauding]
-What was he doing out
wandering around unsupervised?
-Who knows?
I'll tell you something.
I'm about fed up with these
Tall Oaks North kids.
[Trombone Playing

Kids, entertain yourselves.
Play along with Petey.
No, no, no, no, Petey.
Here we go.

[ScatteredLaughter]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

I wanna talk toyou!
You are so sweet.
He is... special.
He's my bitch.
Well, Michelle
has confirmed it.
I suck.
What?
I gotta get
some practice.
Don't worry about it.
I mean, that's why we got
the house,imbo.
We plop a keg on the deck,
and the girls come in
offthe beach.
It's like
a hummingbird feeder.
You think so?
I know so.
Guaranteed hotties.
Fellas, nice pad.
Good view, but...
the Sherminator sensors
detect no female life-forms
in the vicinity.
High likelihood of
a sausagefest in progress.
The girls are comin'.
I made some calls.
Yeah.
The Sherminator's
got a point, Kev.
Since when do you
start listening
to the Sherminator?
Since he made me realize
there's an abundance
ofwiener here.
I mean, look around,
dude. Dude?
[ Vicky]
Allright, nowit'syourturn.
[Oz]
Oh, come on.
There'snothing to tell.
Hey, what's up?
What are you guys
talking about?
You know, we'rejust
trading war stories
about college--
who hookedup with who,
who slept with who--
So, Vicky?
Well, there was
this one guy.
How 'bout you?
Oh, you know, there was
a few girls-- three.
Ooh, look at you.
You stud.
Allright, Oz.
Nowthat Kevin told us,
what aboutyou?
You haven't hadthe
slightest bit ofattraction
to any girl at school?
Don't you fuckin' say no.
I know you did.
even if l did,
it wouldn't be anything
more than just
a momentary thing.
Very... uninteresting.
And how about you,
Jessica?
-How many chicks did you
sleep with this year?
-Gee, wouldn't you like to know.
- Fuckyeah, I would.
- [ huckles ]
- ome on, Ozzy.
- Yeah, man. Ball. Pool's yours.
- Hey, Vic, you wanna play?
- Yeah, sure. You wanna break?
What the--
Where are the
fuckin' females?
Jim, can'tyou leave your shirt on?
You'rescaring the chicksaway.
Jim, can'tyou leave your shirt on?
You'rescaring the chicksaway.
[Oz]
Dude, give him a break.
Ozzy, go deep.
Yeah, bro.
You playing?
No.
No, no, keep going.
Flag pattern.
- What are you doin'?
- Fishin'.
[ Groaning ]
Are you okay?
- You okay?
- Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
Is everybody okay?
[Chattering lndistinctly]
- Amazing.
- [Stifler] Yes.
The Force is strong
in that one.
Whoa.
The Sherminator detects
seriousheat at a distance
of two meters.
Prepare to deploy beer.
Sherman, dude,
Iet me give you a valuable
piece ofadvice, okay?
Drop the whole
"Sherminator" thing.
Please repeat
previous statement.
Look, I know your last name
is Sherman, right?
And that rhymes with
The Terminator which was
a big hit movie ten years ago.
But you can't tell me
a girl's ever really
gone for it.
System overload.
Hasta la vista, essica.
What a freak.
[ huckling ]
Vic, hey, you guys
are leaving?
You know, we barely had
a chance to hang out,
you know, catch up.
Well, what are you doing
this weekend?
I can get together.
ool. Let's hang out.
All right.
Bye, Kev.
See ya,ess.
No, no,
that's all wrong.
Thankyou.
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.
So what does he mean,
"meet up"?
You know, like hang out,
grab lunch, whatever.
I told you,
we'rejust friends now.
And he totally understands.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
he understands quite well.
He does.
Oh, no, sir.
These are all wrong foryou.
I mean, seriously.
Sure.
Well, we're friends.
But it's not like I see her
making plans with anyone else.
Right.
I don't see her with
a boyfriend. I think
that puts me on deck.
- [ Laughs ]
- Hey, Vicky only slept with
one guy since we went out.
Imean, that like makesme
50% of herentireguy-relatedlife.
You dipshit.
She didn't sleep with one guy.
She slept with at least three.
- What?
- When a girl tells you how
many guys she slept with,
multiply it by three
and that's the real number.
[Laughs]
Didn 'tyou fuckers learn
anythingat college?
Look, he did not sleep
with three girls, okay?
Much like Sly
and the Family Stone aren't
gonna dance on in here...
and gang-bang me
between the Afros
and the bell bottoms, okay?
It's not gonna happen.
Kevin Meyers did not sleep
with three girls at Michigan.
But why would he lie to me?
It's not a lie. It's an
adjustment. The rule ofthree.
But why would he lie to me?
It's not a lie. It's an
adjustment. The rule ofthree.
The rule ofwhat?
Three.
A guy tells you how many girls
he's hooked up with,
it's not even close to that.
Take that number
anddivide it bythree.
Thenyouget the realtotal.
So, if Kevin's saying
it's been three girls,
it's more like one, or none.
- None?
- Rule ofthree.
It's an exact science,
consistent as gravity.
Ozzy,
I'm happy foryou.
At least you've seen
a nice bod while Heather's
offsucking dick.
Sifler, keep your fantasies
to yourself.
Dude, use
your fuckin' brain.
"Oh, I'm an American
college chick. La, la, la.
"Your European cultural
shit is so charming.
"Ooh, hey.
Hot Spanish guy.
Love your accent.
Love your ding-dong."
I'm telling you, man,
right now there is a dick
in your girlfriend's mouth.
Knock it off.
What'd I say?
[ Giggling, hattering
lndistinctly ]
Oh, my God!
Guys!
heck it out.
Lesbians.
Lesbians live here.
You know,
Mr. Homophobic Wizard,
that it is possible
for women to holdh ands
and not begay.
Friends can hold hands.
Hey, Finch, I don't wanna hear
about you and your boyfriends.
Gojerk off.
Unnecessary.
Tantra teaches you to hold
an orgasm over time...
in anticipation
ofan ultimate moment...
to release it
upon the world.
I'm filling up
to the brim.
That's fucking disgusting!
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[ Guitar: Spanish ]
[ Ringing ]
- Hello?
- Hey, Heather. You're in!
- Oz!
- How's the studying going?
I'd hardly call it studying.
I've been going
to the Picasso Museum,
hanging out at
Sagrada Familia,
going with Pierre
to the Parc Guell.
Hey, who's Pierre?
One ofthe guys
in the program.
He's got a girlfriend
back in France, so we've kind of
got something in common.
Ah, that sounds cool.
Yeah, I've overheard them
on the phone at night.
And, uh, well,
it made me think.
Hey, Oz, I'm reaching under my
shirt, and I'm rubbing myself.
Oh ho ho ho!
Oz, come on.
It's phone sex.
Help me out here.
Okay. Uh--
I'm going over to my bed.
Yeah.
And I'm lying down.
And I'm slowly...
reaching downstairs.
Grab it. Tell me
how big it is.
Listen, Heather,
I'm feeling kind of awkward.
Oz.
Ifwe can't physically be
with each other, then we have
to learn to be more vocal.
Right?
Right. Okay.
Okay, here we go.
I'm reaching in my pants now.
And I'm rubbing it
foryou, Heather.
[ Sighs ]
And it feels so good.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, yeah.
I got--
[ Beeps ]
all waiting.
Oh, shit. Hello?
[ Man Speaking ln
Middle Eastern Dialect ]
Wrong number.
[ ontinues Speaking ]
Hey. Hello.
Wrong number.
[ ontinues ]
All right, look, man.
I got my hand on my dick
right now, okay,
and I'm trying to have sex
with my girlfriend
over the phone.
Emir, good foryou, man.
[ Middle Eastern Dialect ]
Okay.
Hey.
Sorry about that.
Where were we?
I thinkyou were
reaching for something.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, Heather.
I'm rubbing it and
it feels so good.
Hey, Oz, I'm touching myself.
What else do you want me to do?
[ Stifler lmitating Oz ]
Oh, Heather, baby.
Why don't you tell me
my dick is as big as Stifler's.
- Stifler, get off!
- I am getting offjust
listening to the two ofyou.

another time.
Yeah, all right.
Bye-bye. I love you.

Okay, no, no, no.

Efforts must be doubled.
"Efforts must be doubled."
Absolutely.
[Girl]
Jenny, where'd you put
my clarinet?
I think I shoved it
in your box.
Oh, thanks!
Bad man.
I'm a bad, bad man.
Michelle. Michelle.
Hi. Hi.
Jim, what are you
doing here?
I, uh-- uh--
Well, I thought
you had said--
You can't just
stand out here.
[Jim]
Look, uh, I need your help.
Nadia's coming back,
and I don't--
I don't wanna be
this awkward,
bumbling, nervous guy
with her.
I don't wanna seem
like a dork.
Well, I know that feeling.
Spend your life playing
in the band,
it doesn't exactly give you
the ultra-cool hipster image.
I thinkyou're pretty cool.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Michelle, why did you
ditch me after prom?
I didn't ditch you.
I-- I just--
Our date was over.
I mean, did you
want some...
funky, weird,
next-morning good-bye?
It's not like I wanted
you to pretend you were
in love with me or something.
Why would I pretend that?
Guys do that.
Yeah, well, I'm not
like other guys.
I know.
Okay,
I'm gonna help you.
Really?
Yeah, I feel bad
for saying that you sucked,
even though you kind ofdid.
Oh. Okay.
Uh, I'm just--
Let's just get started.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, I'm a hot girl.
Right.
Okay, what do you wanna do?
I wanna feel your boobs.
No, you dingbat.
You don'tjust go
groping away.
You don'tjust go
groping away.
You gotta preheat the oven
before you stick in the turkey.
Okay.
Kiss me, here.
Good. Okay, now,
the collarbone--
kiss.
Good,im.
Oh, you're making me wet.
Holy shit. Really?
No, I wasjust saying that
so you could practice.
Ofcourse.
[ Whistling ]
[Michelle]
Okay,Jim. That wasgood.
Let's work on something else.
Does direction matter-- Iike
clockwise, counterclockwise--
make a difference?
Okay,im,
this is what
I'm talking about.
Your main problem is...
you're so uptight.
Do I seem uptight
about my sexual stuff?
No.
The biggest pointer
I could give you is...
you have to feel comfortable
in any situation.
Stand up.
Hmm?
- Stand up.
- Ohh!
Now, this is
a fucked-up situation.
What happened to preheating?
We're skipping
a few chapters.
Oh, okay.
This is good.
This is good.
Obviously.
Ooh!
Gilligan's lsland,
Mr. Howell.
Wh-What?
You've got to control
yourself and think of
something nonsexual.
I haven't even touched
you yet, and you're turning
into the Sears Tower.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, uh, nonsexual.
Right, right.
Um, okay.

Cleaning my bathroom.
Dung beetles.

Okay. Now,
don't freak out.
I'm gonna do something
to push your threshold.
Okay--
Oh, that's cold!
What are you doing?
I just shoved
a trumpet in your ass.
Aren't instruments fun?
Okay, I think you've just
crossed my threshold.
[KeyRattles ln Lock]

Okay, good night, then.

Paint thinner.
[Continues]
David?
Shit.
[ Siren hirping ]
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Hands where
we can see 'em!
Both hands! Get the other
hand up, goddamn it!
I can't! I can't!
I'm glued!
I'm glued!
Sorry.
Relax your hands.
I'll take it
from here, okay?
[Oz]
Don't worry,Jimbo.
You'regonna be fine, buddy.
Jim, this happens
to the best of us.
Left foot first.
Easy does it. Good.
- Watch your head.
- All right. Take a seat.
- Ahh!
- Excuse me, sir.
Are you a family member?
Fuck, no!
This is just
too good to miss!
Okay, sir, you're just
gonna have to wait here.
All right?
[ huckles ]
This summer's
turnin' out to be great.
Mucilage is, um,
dangerous territory.
And I would think
any adhesive product...
would have a warning
right on the--
on the tube.
I thought it was,
uh, uh, lubricant.
Okay, I was trying
to use lubricant.
Oh.
Oh.
Son, couldn't you have left
that disgusting thing at home?
Excuse me?
Well, that kind
of material is
offensive to me.
[ Sarcastically ]
Oh, well, we're sorry.
But you see, my son
couldn't leave it at home...
because he's having a bit
ofa medical emergency.
That's right.
Thanks, Dad.
Your opinion of his taste
in video rentals,
I'm afraid,
is, uh, not
a priority, lady.
Dad--
Okay? It's at the bottom
ofthe totem pole.
Okay?
[ Whispering ]
Thankyou, Dad. Okay.
My son...
is sitting here
right now...
with his hand
glued to his penis.
But that doesn't mean
anything to you,
does it?
Because you
don't have a penis.
Or may be you do!
Dad--
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Ow!
You know, itjust bugs me
when-when-when people
speak before they think.
You know, they speak--
How you doin', son?
Ah.
I've been better.
[Dad]
Boy, that doesn 't look
too bad,Jim.
Good job, Doctor.
The swelling should subside
in about eight or nine days.
The swelling should subside
in about eight or nine days.
Eight or-- Eight or nine--
Beach party's in a week.
Nadia's coming.
Oh. Oh.
Doctor, my-my son
has a party in seven days,
and there's a young lady
coming...
that he's been
waiting to--
he's been waiting
to get with.
I'd tell your son
to keep his pants on
during that party.
Oh, yes, yes. Believe me,
I will be doing that.
It goes without saying.
But if his pants...
decide to come off
during the party,
couldhe have
full use ofhis,
um, penis?
Okay.
This should shave
a couple ofdays off.
Oh, good.
Thankyou, Doctor.
Jim,
that's good news.
This has been
a good-news day, son.
Here. Put this on.
Little chilly
out there.
Well, here we are.
You know,im, um,
I think we should keep
your mother in the dark
about the incident tonight.
I think the whole glue
thing might get her
a little queasy.
I don't know how I get
myself into these things.
But thanks for understanding.
You've been really cool.
Imean, between thisand,
you know--
You know, you may be
Jimbo orJumbo...
orimbodinny
to these guys in here,
but I want you to know
there are two people...
who still remember where
James Emanuel Levenstein
came from.
We're awful proud
ofyou, son.
Thanks, Dad.
Don't forget
your penis cream.
[Finch Humming]
[ Moaning ]
[Finch]
That wasit.
Right there.
That was a pure
tantric moment.
The ficus, the water--
it was all erotic.
One more stimulant,
I wouldhave had
full release.
Finch, stay the fuck
away from that ficus.
- That's a jizz-free ficus.
- [ Whimpers ]
There he is. Morning,
Jimbo. How's the twig
and giggleberries, man?
Oh, very colorful.
My dick looks like
a paint-by-numbers.
[Chuckles]Jim, you're
the only guy I know whose dick
needsan instruction manual.
[ Laughing ]
[Phone Rings]
Casa de Stifler.
Oh, hey.
What, you're here now?
No, that's cool.
You know, if you want to
hang out with theseguys.
Okay, then.
I'll meet you out front.
- Hey, Stifler, was that--
- Eat shit, Shitbrick.
[DoorCloses]
She's here.
My lady has arrived.
I gotta prepare.
Here we go.
Great.
Stifler's mom is here?
This could be
a disaster.
[Oz]
Whoa.
Not unless Stifler's mom
drives a moped.
Moped?
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers.
How you doin', boys?
- That's Stifler's little brother.
- What are you doinghere?
Pussy, man.
I'm here for the pussy.
Take a number.
Gentlemen, why all the noise?
Everybody knows that this is
my special day.
- What is that?
- Is that a fuckin' dress?
Are you wearing a dress?
Shitbrick, meet
my little brother.
Little brother,
meet Shitbrick.
- That's your brother?
- Yes.
My lady's not coming.
So my entire...
stockpile is wasted,
and I look ridiculous!
Excuse me.
[ Shouts ]
That didn't look
too good.
No.
Let's go find your room.
So, where are
the fuckin' females?
I can't believe
I finally got you alone.
That only took,
what, six weeks?
So, uh, are you alone too?
- Yep.
- Good.
I'm all alone.
Guess what I had
in mind?
[ hattering ]
Hey, Marco, can you
get your balls off me?
- Thanks.
- Heather, what the hell's
going on over there?
Uh, nothing.
It's just my flatmates.
I guess this is kind of
a lost cause, huh?
Yeah, I guess so.
I can't wait.
See ya this weekend?
- I can't wait either.
- Bye-bye.
- Surprise!
- Holy-- Nadia!
You're here? You're here.
What areyou doing here?
Jim, I got so tired
of sight seeing.
But you're--
you're early.
Okay.
Nice to know you.
I will leave.
No!
No. Uh, don't--
don't leave.
Don't leave.
No leaving.
Uh, no. Uh--
It's just, I'm not
gonna be ready--
I mean, the party
won't be ready, uh,
until Saturday.
I can... stay here
until then?
Yeah.
I'm gonna be right back.
Is that okay?
Okay.
Nadia.
Who's in my room.
Now. Holy shit.
[Michelle]
Allright, I'vegot aplan.
Okay. How about
I come back with you...
andyousay, "Hello, this is
Michelle, mygirlfriend. "
And obviously,
Nadia won't expect you
to hop in the sack.
And then we break up
the day of the party.
And you're all healed
and back on the market.
- You're evil.
- No way!
I'm like upid.
And I know how
to make a girl jealous.
This is gonna be fun.
[Jim]
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner,
but we just started seeing
each othera few weeks ago.
Um-- But
I'd really love it...
if you stayed here.
I think you should stay
and have fun at the party.
Good foryou,im.
Ofcourse I will stay.
That's grea-- Aiee!
That's my nipples!
She just loves my nipples.

Oh, my God.
You still broken?
Oh, my God.
You still broken?
No.
I'm fine.
I might have to...
actually go through with this.
Jim, what's the big deal
with Nadia, anyway?
I mean, okay, so she's
50,000 times hotter...
than most girls, but...
come on,
it's just sex.
Oh, no.
You saw the thing
on the lnternet.
Did it look like
I might have had...
a slight interest
in Nadia then?
Add another year to that.
Okay.
Hey, why don't you bring
Nadia to the concert first?
It'll be a cool date.
We'll see how things go.
Michelle,
you have been great.
Thank you.
Any time.
ome on.
You ready to break up?
You big, stupid dummy!
Theater is so cool!
[Michelle]
ldon't care ifyou are the best
layl've everhadin my life.
I hate your guts anyway.
Don't say that.
And I don't care
ifyou did give me
ten orgasms in a row,
because you smell
really bad.
No! I smell
really bad!
Because we've been having
so much sex, and--
and I haven't showered,
and I wanna shower!
So, don't you go being all
super-sexy guy anymore,
because I am now
impervious...
to your unrelenting machismo
and sexual ardor.
And that includes
fucking me in the ass!
So there!
We had
something special.
[CarEngineStarts]
What's up?
What's up, dog?
[Rock, lndistinct]
Vicky. Hey.
Hey.
I'm so glad you came.
You want something
to drink or--
Hey.
an I help you?
Kevin.
That's my date.
What?
You-- You saved them all.
How sweet.
You don't think
I'm a dork?
Whateveryou are,im,
it is what I like.
Kevin left.
Didn't look good.
Kevin left?
Just wandered
down the beach.
You okay, Kev?
Wanna tell us
what's up?
Wanna feel Finch's ass?
No, l-- I went
to say hi to Vicky,
and she was there
with a date.
You hooked up with
three girls this year.
You're doing fine.
Rule ofthree, Oz.
I guess I was living in the past--
wanting to party with you guys...
and be with Vicky,
it's just like high school.
You remember
that day after prom?
You know, we made
a toast to the next step.
I guess I never took it.
My brother said that
by the end ofthe summer
I'd see the big picture.
Andlsee it.
No matter what, times change
andthingsare different.
The problem is,
I don't want them to be.
You know, Kevin,
I haven't moved on either.
I've been obsessed
with the one woman lcan't
have a realfuture with,
other than a very kinky,
extremely warped one.
I gotta find
a new goddess.
It's gonna take patience,
but I've been celibate all summer.
Yeah, you kinda get
used to it, though, huh?
Are you insane?
Hey, look, Kev,
different doesnot
necessarilymean worse.
As a matter offact,
I think things are
just getting better.
Or am I gonna have to drag
your ass back to that party
and prove it to you?
I'll walk.
[Rock]
Wow!
You know, you have
beautiful eyes.
- Oh, you're sweet.
- That's a really nice top.
Oh. Thanks.
You're welcome.
- Wanna fuck?
- Are you serious?
ome on, baby.
Give it to the Stifmeister.
- I think you better--
- Your loss.
Wow. You know,
you have beautiful eyes.
ome here, dude.
ome on. You're making
an ass out of yourself.
You're ruining my mojo.
And you're not
the Stifmeister, okay?
It takes years to develop
true Stifmeister style.
ome on, man!
I just wanna see some boobs.
Hey, Pop-Tart.
Dream on, midget.
Excuse him. ome here.
Take this. You're on cop watch.
Go out in the driveway.
See any cops, call me, okay?
Steve--
All right.
Gentlemen, uh,
this appears to be a party.
Guys, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go look for Nadia.
Good luck.
Ahh.
[Jim]
So what was this year
like foryou?
Did you miss high school?
Well, no. When you travel
as much as I do,
you get used to
moving on.
But I have great memories.
- Wow, can we go in there?
- The lighthouse?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes, we can.
How romantic.
Jim, come on.
Wow!
Wow!
Oh, it'sbeautiful!
ool!
Jim, I have told you my
memories from high school.
What are yours?
Oh, uh--
Well, uh, you.
You have not changed.
Jim, relax.
We arejust,
how do you say,
tooting our horns.
Actually, that is
quite difficult.
How do you mean?
Well, this one time
at band camp,
I--
Holy shit.
What? Tell me.
Uh, well, uh,
this one time
at band camp,
I got stuck
playing this trombone.
And I can't play
anything at all.
So I totally sucked.
And everyone thought
I was this Petey guy,
but I didn't know
what to think, so I just
kept playing and playing,
and I didn't know
what I was doing.
It was so funny!
[ huckling ]
I gotta go.
What? Why?
Nadia,
please don't take this
the wrong way,
but, but you're--
you're everything
that I used to want.
And as much
as I may really,
really regret
what I'm about to do,
there's somebody else
I want to be with.
You-You want
the band geek?
Nadia, I am a band geek.
I just never
joined the band.
You go get your geek.
Someday I will find mine.
# Well, my mind is now
playing tricks on me #
# And the world is crashing #
# I think about it #
[Continues, lndistinct]
Hey, um, Kevin Meyers.
Hi. Sorry I was
a dick before.
It's okay, man.
My name's Brett.
Uh, could you
give us a sec?
Sure.
Look, you don't
have to do this.
May be I was
being selfish...
in wanting to be
your friend.
May be it's just
not gonna work.
Victoria,
I would much rather have you
as a friend than not have you
in my life at all.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Yeah-hah!
Partyon!
Yeah! Yeah!
- I don't know. From the
lighthouse all the way--
- Hey, handsome.
Heather! Hey.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I was gonna pick you up
at the airport in, like,
two hours.
I took an earlier flight,
and I thought I'd surprise you.
Yeah, you did.
Kinda weird without
the phone, huh?
We'll get used to it.
Come on. I wanna
hear all about it.
We'll grab you a drink.
Steve, this cop-watch
thing is horseshit.
Hello?
[ Crackling ]
Man, this sucks.
[ Amber ]
Who is it out there?
It's the Stifmeister, baby.
Is that so?
Life's a bitch,
isn't it?
It's all right.
You don't have to
say anything.
I'm used to girls
ignoring me.
Or making fun of me.
"Come on, Sherman.
Be the Sherminator."
Like the movie.
How clever.
I-l get it, okay?
May be I am a geek.
Whatever.
Yes! Yes, you are!
All right.
I... am the Sherminator.
Ohh!
A sophisticated
sex robot sent
back through time...
to change the future
for one lucky lady.
I am lucky lady?
That's right, Nadia.
You've been targeted
for Shermination.

Oh! Oh, no!
Help!

# Just to take a fall #
# The blind among the blind
And I say #
# There's an echo
'round my heart #
# Dragging me down #
# Beneath the waves
in silence I fall #
# There's a halo
above my head #
# Spinning me 'round #
# 'Cause I don't know
if I'm alive or dead #
# There's a dagger
in my hand #
# Bleeding me dry #
# And all we have to lose #
# Is time #
# And what we lose
we leave behind #
# Stay around
and we will shine #
