A man's life, they say,
is the sum of all his actions.
But his actions are sometimes the result
of the hopes, dreams and desires...
... of those who came before him.
In that sense, my life began
even before I was born...
... on an afternoon of June 1924.
Well, I never thought I'd see a son
of mine mooning over a girl...
...like a lily-livered poet.
- You're off your beat, ain't you, Pop?
- And so are you.
Do you think all those
important people from Main Line...
...would be coming to her wedding
if she married you?
Do you blame the girl for choosing
William Lawrence III...
...of Rittenhouse Square...
...instead of Michael Flanagan
of South Philadelphia?
Now, wish her every happiness
and get out of here.
Do what any sensible Irishman
would do: Go get drunk.
Every happiness, Kate.
Here you are, Mr. Lawrence.
Everything's been arranged,
just as your mother instructed.
Your train for New York
leaves at 9 in the morning.
There'll be a car waiting for you
at the station.
And don't forget,
the Mauritania sails at noon.
If there's anything more
that we can do for you, let us know.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Isn't this lovely, Bill?
- Yes, isn't it?
I thought we'd never get away
from the reception.
I don't know why we had to come to
a hotel when home is five minutes away.
Well, your mother wanted us
to be alone on our wedding night.
It was very considerate of her.
Yes, Mother thinks of everything,
doesn't she?
Do you realize
you've only kissed me once today?
I'm sorry.
I realize a bridegroom
is supposed to be nervous...
...but I think you're overdoing it.
Maybe.
Bump.
The train leaves early
in the morning.
Lovely. Very lovely.
Bill, I want so much
to make you happy.
I've done you
a terrible wrong, Kate.
I can't make you happy.
It was my mother
who wanted this marriage.
To give her a grandson.
Just as your mother wanted you
to be a Lawrence.
But I can't love you, Kate.
I can't love anyone.
Bill, dear.
Don't pity me!
Bill!
Oh, my God!
Logan!
One moment.
There we are.
- Kate?
- Who is she?
- Beat it.
- Just a minute, big boy.
I ain't sat up half the night
listening to you...
Go on, beat it.
Katie, what...?
Oh, Mike.
I just had to talk to you.
You're the only one I...
- What could have happened to her?
- Don't excite yourself, Mary.
Well, somebody must have seen her.
She couldn't have vanished into thin air.
Kate.
Kate, where have you been?
Do you realize
it's almost 4:00 in the morning?
We've been up all night
trying to find you.
- You frightened us half to death...
- Stop. Can't you see that...?
What happened, Kate?
I've just come home, that's all.
Then you haven't heard about Bill?
The police called. Hours ago.
He was driving
along the Lancaster Pike.
There was an accident.
He must have been going
awfully fast.
He was killed instantly.
Kate, darling.
- Isn't he handsome?
- You have a fine, healthy son.
At last we have a boy in the family.
Mrs. Lawrence.
May I speak
to Katherine alone, please?
It's all right.
Fine boy.
Anthony Judson Lawrence.
No, Kate.
I haven't been idle
these past few months.
I couldn't let what happened
to my boy go without investigation.
That is not my grandson.
Now, I prefer not to make
any trouble.
You won't make any trouble
for me, Mrs. Lawrence.
Because if you do,
the whole town will know...
...what happened with Bill
in that hotel room.
You're very clever, aren't you?
All right.
My attorneys are prepared
to pay anything within reason...
...on condition that you give up
the Lawrence name.
- No.
- Then you won't get a penny from me.
Neither my son nor I will ever make
any claim on you or your money.
But we'll keep the Lawrence name.
I've paid for it.
You wanted to see me, Mike?
I didn't wanna be bothering you before,
but I ran into your grandmother at Mass.
Yes, she told me.
Thank you for calling.
I only stayed away because I thought
I shouldn't be hanging around.
I appreciate that, Mike...
...but I think it's best if you didn't
come here again after today.
Katie, I wanna marry you.
I love you. I always have.
I'm sorry, I can never marry you.
- Well, why not?
- Because of him.
Are you afraid what people
are gonna say?
We don't have to stay here.
To hell with them.
We can go to some other town.
No, Philadelphia is our home.
Now, how are you gonna get along?
Well, I've already arranged
to do secretarial work...
...with the Junior League.
Of course, it doesn't pay very much,
but I can't take just any job...
...I have to maintain some kind
of social position for his sake.
Social position?
Haven't you learned anything yet?
You're gonna mess up three lives
on account of social position?
Mike, you don't understand.
Fifty years ago, my grandmother
came to this country as a servant.
For three generations,
we've struggled to be accepted.
- I won't throw that away now.
- Well, I came with nothing too.
But I'm doing better
than my grandfather ever did.
And I'll be rich someday.
I can give you both anything you want.
You can make yourself a millionaire,
but you can't open doors for him.
- Is that so?
- Not in Philadelphia.
As Anthony Judson Lawrence,
he'll be able to meet the right people.
Make the right contacts.
Someday, he'll take the place
in this city that belongs to him.
All right.
All right, you try and make
a Lawrence out of him if you can...
...but don't you ask me to stay out
of his life, because he's my son...
...and I'm gonna be around
to keep an eye on him.
I don't care if you do call him
Anthony Judson Lawrence.
Hey, Carson, let it roll.
Okay, okay.
Herbie, move it down about 10 feet.
- Tony.
- Good morning, Mr. Flanagan.
- How's it going?
- Fine, sir.
Come here.
- You get a chance to look at these?
- Yes, sir.
We got a completion date
of September the 1 st.
That's for excavation and foundation.
- Think the boys can do it?
- Well...
...I might have
to chew them out a little bit.
There's a bonus each day
we come in ahead.
- No kidding? Sold.
- Right.
I gotta get back. Ed will pick up
your progress reports each day.
Hey, how's your mother?
Oh, she's fine.
She's working too hard, as usual.
What committee is it now?
She's got two or three jobs.
I can never keep track of them.
- She's quite a woman, your mother.
- Yeah.
Say hello for me, will you?
If you think of it.
- I will.
- Be seeing you.
Hey, Carson,
what are you waiting for?
- I'm getting a light.
- Let's keep it moving, huh?
Okay, okay.
Where did Flanagan
get the eager beaver?
One of his summer wonders?
- Okay, Carson, what's your problem?
- I got no problem.
I didn't go to college.
What's yours?
My problem is to get that truck out there
so that that truck can come in here.
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?
How do you wanna handle this?
Pleasant or unpleasant?
- What's the matter? Late for tea?
- All right, unpleasant.
How big was the truck, babe,
before you see it?
Bounce your big hulk on that bumper,
and let me get out of here.
I ain't moving
until I check the damages.
- Damages? They're my damages.
- Watch your language.
- It's my right of way!
- Right of way?
What are you, colorblind?
Don't you know a red light?
- That light was green!
- Green?
- Jeez!
- All right, all right, all right.
How did it happen?
That dumb broad
ran through a red light.
Don't you call me a dumb broad.
You tell your friend to mind his language.
Just a second. I don't have
to take orders from you.
- That truck's rolling, I'm in charge.
- So get it rolling.
I ain't moving
until I check the damages.
All right...
I'm sorry, Carson.
Al, take him back to the shack.
Hanley!
Hanley, help me get
this truck out of here.
- It really wasn't my fault.
- I'll take your word for it.
If you get your motor started,
maybe I can untangle this mess.
Hey, look, we're doing
the best we can.
Move it back on the down jiggle.
- The what?
- Never mind. Just move it back slowly.
Honey, please, don't pump it.
Now, floor it, it's flooded.
You're making me nervous.
Why don't you come
over here and jump on the bumper.
I'll go back there
and honk your horn.
I have ice cream in this car,
and I wanna get home before it melts.
Are you satisfied?
You seem to be getting it
from both ends.
Some days you shouldn't
get out of bed, right?
Right.
Sorry you got so cut up.
I hope you don't get into any trouble.
Well...
Well...
Well, it's been nice meeting you,
even briefly.
Yeah.
- I know, don't push it...
- Don't pump it.
Pump it. Floor it.
Tony, I try to understand you,
really I do...
...but suppose someone
had seen you fighting?
You seem to think
everybody in Philadelphia...
...has nothing better to do than
to check up on me.
Don't think they won't.
Turn around.
I could understand it if you were 15,
but you're old enough to know now...
...that you have to consider
the consequences of everything you do.
How do you consider
the consequences of a left hook?
It's nothing to joke about.
That is what I've been
trying to tell you.
- Is my jacket in here?
- Yes.
You know, in a way,
I hope you do lose that job.
Those aren't the kind of people
you should be associating with.
We've been having this argument
since I was in high school.
Where else can I earn
that kind of money?
I know it's very generous of
Mr. Flanagan, but I was wondering if...
- What time is Chet picking you up?
- About 8:30. Would you like to join us?
Tony, listen to me. Isn't Chet's uncle
a very close friend of the Rankins?
Yeah, I think he's dating
the upstairs maid.
Will you be serious?
Mr. Rankin is on the board
of several big corporations.
- Why not ask Chet to introduce you...
- Mother.
I try to understand you too,
but Chet is a friend of mine.
- He's not a contact.
- What's wrong with asking for a favor?
Nothing, but not that kind of favor.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to snap
my head off.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Is Tony here?
- Yo.
Well, hello.
How's the champ?
Fine. Did you get everything
straightened out?
Oh, sure.
Everything but Carson's head.
I might have to get him
one of them silver plates for it.
You sound proud of it.
Well, I ought to be.
I coached the kid, didn't I?
You ought to be glad of it. The first time
I seen him at the playground...
Your interest in young people
is very commendable.
But I'm not trying to raise
the next champion of the world.
A man's gotta be able
to defend himself, Mrs. Lawrence.
This is a cruel and pernicious world
we live in.
Yes, I'm aware of that.
- Excuse me, I gotta be going.
- Tony, wait.
So, what are you all lit up for?
You tending bar or something?
He's going to a dance
at the Cricket Club.
I have a friend of mine
who usually has to be carried home.
That's a lovely conversation piece
on your eye too.
Tony, don't you dare...
If anybody asks me, I'll tell them
that I ran into a badminton bird.
When you get there,
I hope you'll remember...
I will, Mother.
I'll be polite to all the old ladies.
And I'll dance with all the wallflowers,
and I'll make myself a lot of contacts.
- Good night.
- Well, have a nice...
...time.
You're still at it, aren't you, Kate?
Double bourbon and a double Scotch.
- Make the Scotch a single, will you?
- Yes, sir.
- Uncle Morton.
- Well, Chester.
I see you're in business
at the same old stand.
Just a little ginger ale.
- Good evening, Tony.
- Good evening, sir.
At least you're here. I suppose
we should be grateful for that.
Uncle Morton, I wouldn't miss
a club dance for anything.
- Uncle Shippen has been asking for you.
- Really? Dr. Ship is here?
Isn't this gathering
a little wild for him?
- Is that intended to be funny, Chester?
- Terribly sorry. I lost my head.
- He's over here.
- All right, I'll be along.
You better come now,
before you get plastered.
Such a warm, loveable clunk.
You never met
the world-famous geneticist, Dr. Ship?
I mean, this one is a great-uncle.
He's a very big expert
on heredity versus environment.
Keep these on ice. Come on.
He's still trying to find out whether
guinea pigs are born that way...
...or they have to learn it.
- Dr. Ship, how are you?
- Chester, you're looking well.
Clean living and straight thinking, sir.
This is my roommate, Tony Lawrence.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- How are you, young man?
Lawrence?
Anthony Judson Lawrence?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, Morton didn't tell me that.
I was a great friend of your paternal
grandmother, Mrs. DeWitt Lawrence.
But I don't suppose
you remember her.
No, sir. She died in Europe
when I was 7.
I gathered that she and my mother
didn't get along very well.
Families sometimes
have these little differences.
How did you two boys
get together?
Mutual interests. Tony is an A student,
active in campus affairs.
- A gentleman.
- I see.
Attraction of opposites.
Well, I hope
we meet again, Anthony.
- Spending the summer in Philadelphia?
- Yes, sir. I've got a job here.
That's something for you
to think about, Chet.
Sir, it's hard enough
trying to steal...
...some of my own money
from Uncle Morton.
When and if you prove yourself fit
to handle your fortune, Chester...
...l'll gladly relinquish my guardianship.
- Don't be too hard on the youth.
Run along and enjoy yourselves, boys.
And, Chet, do try not to disgrace us.
Sir, you wound me.
- Very nice meeting you, sir.
- Thank you.
I try to keep you informed. I didn't
realize that you were so interested.
I was an executor
of Mrs. Lawrence's will, so naturally...
As a matter of fact, the dean
spoke highly of this Lawrence boy.
Really? Well, we'll see
how he develops.
Interesting heredity there.
Most interesting.
Like crossing the Sahara on a dry day.
Get back to the oasis.
Well, Carter Henry, how are you?
- When did you get back to town?
- A couple weeks ago.
- Hi, I thought you were going to call me.
- Well, honey, numbers confuse me.
This is Tony Lawrence, Joan Dickinson,
and my cousin, Carter Henry.
- How do you do?
- Now, be nice to Carter...
...because he has $20 million.
Well, 18, give or take a few.
- It's you.
- Who?
"Don't pump it, floor it," who.
- That's right.
- I beg your pardon?
You suppose that lady ever got home
before her ice cream melted?
What are you talking about?
Carter, darling, I'm sorry.
I owe this gentleman a big favor.
The wound he bears
is because of me.
Well, in that case, could I collect?
I mean, may we have a dance?
- You don't mind, do you, Carter?
- No.
Well, don't look at me.
What is this?
You got me.
I always thought he was shy.
Well, I don't understand.
If you're studying to be a lawyer,
why that kind of job?
Toughening up your muscles
for the football field?
There must be some reason.
- Well, give me a hint.
- All right.
It begins with K.
- Kick the Can.
- No.
Cold cash.
I need the money.
I was going to say something clever,
but that's an honest answer, isn't it?
I got a long grind.
I got another year at Princeton
and three years of law school.
And then time to get
a practice started.
- At least you have someplace to go.
- Haven't you?
Are you kidding?
I have no talents. Nothing.
I was very carefully educated
to be an idiot.
And I was a very good student.
Of course, most of the girls I know
are married now.
To very nice young fellows.
Very cautious, prudent young men.
It's just that it wouldn't have mattered
much which nice fellow they married.
You mean just anybody
out of the stag line?
With the buttoned-down collars
and the buttoned-down families.
Oh, I don't know. It just seems
there ought to be more.
But I guess there isn't.
Not where I'm likely to find it, anyway.
I don't know why I'm going on like this.
Carter deserves better than that.
Carter. He's the fellow
with the 20, give or take 2?
Are you two...?
No, no, we're not engaged.
- He hasn't asked me yet.
- Do you expect him to?
Well, I think he will.
Takes you out of circulation,
doesn't it?
I should say not.
If Carter can take his time,
why can't I?
Besides, he's going
to be gone most of the summer.
Reorganizing one of his mines.
That's nice. I'm gonna be in town.
Well, then we'll probably run
into each other occasionally.
Hardly avoid it.
Could I ring you up sometime?
- lf you'd like.
- I'd like it. That is, if you like hamburgers.
I'm a chili girl myself.
Well, that's all right.
We got no problems.
Well, then we might as well go in.
By the way, I want you
to meet my father sometime.
He's a lawyer.
Dickinson? You mean, Gil...
Dickinson and Dawes?
Gee whiz, gosh, you think...?
People will think I'm dating you in order
to make a hit with your father.
He's not that accessible.
One hamburger, one chili,
coming up.
What is it you wanted my advice about?
How to say goodbye?
That's the point.
I don't wanna say goodbye.
If we love each other,
why should we?
Because Tony
has more sense than you do.
He can't offer you anything,
and he won't ask you to wait.
So he'll walk nobly out of your life...
...and work himself silly
trying to forget you.
Chet, don't you see?
I could work with Tony.
I could be a part of his life.
I could help him.
I know it won't be easy at first...
...but I don't wanna lose those years.
Those could be wonderful years.
Yes, indeedy.
Philadelphia has a special technique
for situations like this.
I can think of a dozen ways
to break it up.
I'm sure your father
can think of a hundred.
No, you're wrong.
Father likes Tony.
Really? Does he?
I don't know, maybe you're both crazy
enough to pull it off.
Anyway, you've got a right to try.
Don't wait, Jo.
Don't give them a chance
to work on you.
And don't let them do to you
what they did to me two years ago.
- What do you mean?
- Do you think that I really like this stuff?
We were even married.
For two whole days.
Her family was very reasonable
about the annulment.
And, of course,
some money changed hands.
Chet, I'm so sorry.
Just make sure I don't have
to be sorry for you.
Marry him, and marry him now.
They can't buy Tony off.
- But I just...
- Make him marry you.
- How?
- The way women have been making...
...men marry them
since the Stone Age.
Oh, Tony.
This isn't very conducive
to sensible thinking.
- I better go back before...
- I don't want sensible thinking.
Neither do I.
You know, it's funny.
Every time I ever do
anything rash...
...it's like I have this voice
in my head that keeps saying:
"I never should've done that.
That was not considered."
I say, "Yeah, you're right.
Next time, I'll be a good boy.
Patted on the head.
Pinched on the cheek.
Spend the rest of my life
counting from one to 10."
There's really only one decision
to make...
...and I just made it.
I don't think I wanna hear this.
- Come on.
- Can't we just stay for a few minutes?
No. Let's drive down
to Maryland tonight...
...we can get a license in the morning,
we can get married.
I love you very much.
You've gotta marry me.
I mean, you will, won't you?
Oh, Tony, are you sure
you won't be sorry?
Yeah, I'm sure, honey.
But, look, I've got only like $90 at home
and $600 in the bank.
We're poor people.
Do you mind that?
Tony, I mind it so much...
...I put a bag in the back of that car,
and it's all packed.
And if you open it up,
I've got a diary inside.
And I put in the names
of our first four children.
Four? In that case, we haven't got
a minute to lose. Come on.
I'll be right out.
I love you.
Hi, Mom. What are you doing
up so late?
I've been waiting for you.
Good evening, Joan.
Won't you both come in?
Well, Joan and I were...
Is it something special?
Well, I have a surprise for you.
Well...
- Father.
- Hello, Joan. Tony.
Good evening, sir.
All right, how did I give it away?
When you're trying to pack secretly...
...you shouldn't ask the maid
to help you with the ironing.
Well, sir, we are going
to get married tonight.
I see. Well, I'd been rather expecting
something like that.
I'd only hoped you two
would come to me...
...before you took any definite steps.
Mrs. Lawrence and I have been sitting
here feeling rather old and neglected.
I'm sorry. I suppose I should have...
Tony, do you object
to discussing it now?
No, I don't object to discussing it.
But it's not gonna change anything.
You see, Father, if you brought
a shotgun, you're too early.
And if you came to stop us,
you're too late.
Then you won't mind leaving Tony
and me alone for a few minutes.
Why can't I stay?
The daughter is usually
sent out of the room.
It's okay, honey. Come on.
Joan, dear, come to the kitchen,
have a cup of coffee with me.
It seems awfully mid-Victorian.
- Well, shall we sit down?
- Yes, sir.
Your mother brought in
some ice and soda.
- Shall we have a drink?
- Yeah, I'd like that.
I'm beginning to get
that dry, parched feeling.
There's no reason to. It's not
gonna be that sort of scene.
Well, Tony, I'll try to make it brief.
You don't have to convince me
that you're a fine young man.
Your mother is happy about Joan.
We're only thinking
of what's best for both of you.
Now, you'll be going back
to Princeton next week.
I wonder if you've had time
to make any definite plans.
Well, we haven't exactly figured it out,
but other couples do.
And if two people
love each other, why...
Ordinarily, I'd agree with you.
But you're not
an average young couple.
Nor is Joan an average young girl.
Oh, I don't mean to imply
she's spoiled, exactly...
...but I couldn't help indulging her
after her mother died.
Sir, I can't give her what you have,
but I don't think she expects that.
All right, now...
Now, suppose she tried
to make this tremendous adjustment.
Living in one room, counting
the pennies, and all the rest of it.
I'd be far more worried
about the effect on you, Tony.
The realization that, day after day,
you were depriving her...
...of the things
she'd always been used to.
You'd be tempted
to compromise, Tony.
And I'm afraid you'd be endangering
the one thing that makes you unique:
Your faith in yourself. Your pride.
And worst of all...
...you'll be destroying the very thing
that made Joan fall in love you.
I'd never let it come to that.
I could always make a good living
in the construction business.
You mean you'd give up the law?
Does it mean so little to you?
That's not the impression I got.
- Naturally, it's the last thing I'd want.
- Or Joan would want.
I only meant I'd do that
if there was no other way.
But perhaps there is, Tony.
Now, you don't have a preceptor
for law school yet.
Of course, with your record,
you'd have no trouble finding one.
Oh, yes. I checked with the university,
and I was most impressed.
Tony, I'd like to be your preceptor.
You'll be graduating in June,
only a few months away.
An ideal time for a wedding.
After the honeymoon
and when you're at law school...
...we'll arrange for you
to work in our office.
You'll come in contact with some
of the best legal minds in this country.
And you'll be paid a salary
adequate to support a wife.
Then when you pass the bar,
you'll come into the firm.
Now, I'm confident
that in due time...
...you'll become a partner
in Dickinson and Dawes.
Is that all you can say?
No, sir. I'm just trying to get
the top of my head back on.
It opens new vistas, doesn't it?
Just a postponement until June.
- Just how do you...?
- But understand me, Tony.
You'll get no special consideration
because you're my son-in-law.
Rather the opposite. You have to
prove yourself on your own merits.
But I don't want any
special consideration. I'll work my...
- I'll... But I'm not afraid of...
- Fine, fine.
If you'll forgive me, I have a client
first thing in the morning.
- It's about time we called them in.
- Well, I was... Oh, yes.
- Oh, Tony.
- Yes, sir.
Joan may pout a bit.
When my daughter wants something,
she wants it here and now.
You let me be the villain
in the case.
I'll explain the details to her later.
Well, if you say so, sir. Honey!
Cheers.
I feel like a bomb went off in my head.
Your father's been just wonderful.
- Tony. Oh, my God.
- Most fantastic thing's happened to me.
Happened to us.
Yes. We're gonna be married,
but we have to wait until June.
- June?
- Yeah. Till I get out of Princeton.
- Yeah. We can wait that long.
- Why do we have to wait that long?
Because, honey, we did
sort of rush into this thing.
And it's better this way.
It's more practical.
- Practical?
- Yeah, practical.
Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt. I have
an appointment early in the morning.
Could you drive me home?
I took a cab over.
Well, but can't we just sit down
and talk about this for a minute?
I'll explain it all to you later.
- But, Dad...
- What are you being so upset for?
Everything is great.
Come on. Come on.
Thank you, Tony.
There's nothing to worry about.
Just a postponement until June.
Goodnight.
And thank you for your cooperation.
Goodnight.
There's no need to be unhappy.
I merely pointed out
some of the problems involved.
Father, I walked
into that house with a boy...
...who wanted to marry me tonight.
Ten minutes later,
he changed his mind.
How did you talk him out of it?
I didn't talk him out of it.
I may have suggested.
- But Tony made the decision.
- What decision?
He didn't have a preceptor for law school.
He'd have found one, of course.
But if I may say so, not with
the distinction of Dickinson and Dawes.
- You're going to be his preceptor?
- Yes.
My offer included more than that:
A salary while he's at law school...
...and later, a place in the firm.
I made that a definite promise.
No wonder he was grateful.
That was quite a concession
for you to make.
What did Tony have to concede?
Merely to wait. To give you both time
to think things over.
Young people do change
their minds occasionally, you know.
If he had married me tonight...
...would the offer still have held?
Well, an impulsive moment is one thing.
If he'd persisted in it, no.
I'm afraid he wouldn't have fitted in.
- And Tony understood that?
- I'm sure he did.
I see.
- My dear, if you object to his decision...
- Oh, no. Why should I object?
As Tony said,
this is much more practical.
Chet was wrong.
All you had to do
was make the offer attractive enough.
My dear,
I understand your disappointment.
You'll be lonely while he's away
at school. Look, I've got an idea.
Sally Treadwell sails
for Europe on the 20th.
- Why don't you join her.
- Maybe I will.
Maybe I will.
Hello, Tony, good to see you.
Home for the holidays?
Yes, I just got in last night.
I didn't know whether you'd be able
to see me this morning.
I can always see you, Tony.
Go on, sit down.
What can I do for you?
Sir, I haven't heard from Joan
for about two weeks now, and l...
As a matter of fact,
I was going to call you.
Tony, I...
Well, there's no point
in beating around the bush.
I received this half an hour ago.
I'm sorry, Tony.
When Carter came back
and found she'd gone...
...he followed her to Europe.
Tony, I assure you, this needn't
disturb our personal relationship.
I still hope you'll be coming
to the firm as planned.
Would you like me
to introduce you...
...to some of the people
you'll be working with?
No, no, perhaps another day.
Tony.
There's something
in that little black book.
- What's under Z?
- Tony, let me take you home.
Zelda, what's she like?
Did you ever see a babe
that had two heads?
- No. Go on, call her.
- No.
- Come on. Come on, Chet.
- Tony.
Two heads.
Then we can both talk to her.
And she doesn't have
to bring a friend.
- Hello, Tony?
- Hello, Mrs. Lawrence?
- Yeah, this is Chet.
- Oh, Chet, have you seen Tony?
Yeah, I'm with him. I just wanted you
to know he wasn't alone.
Well, is he all right?
He isn't exactly sober,
but he's all right.
I'll get him home
as soon as I possibly can.
- Hey, Tony!
- Hey.
Hi, Zelda, honey. Why don't
you hustle on down here.
Yeah, bring both of them.
It's all right. You take that one.
I'll take this one.
Mrs. Lawrence, I'm sorry.
No, he's all right, really.
Chet, l...
Hello, Chet.
This is Mike Flanagan.
Where are you?
Oh, you're awfully cute, honey.
Come here again.
You wait here, and I'll be right back.
Hey, Uncle Mike.
Hey, come on, boy.
Come on. Have a drink.
Merry Christmas.
Everybody's gotta be happy.
It's merry Christmas.
What did she have to go off
and get married for?
Come on, kid.
Come on, let's go home, huh?
- Is he all right?
- Oh, sure.
Can I do anything?
I think you done enough already, Kate.
There you are.
Are you still feeling sorry for yourself?
You've given a pretty good
imitation of it, you know.
Nope, not anymore.
All she needed
was time to think it over...
...and she sold herself
to the highest bidder.
I really gotta hand it
to old man Dickinson.
He certainly led me down
a garden trail.
Why didn't you give him
a clout in the nose?
What, and lose a good connection?
It cost me too much to get it.
I just learned the rules of the game.
Tony, I suppose
this is partly my fault.
Oh, no, don't worry about it, Mom.
Dear Santa Claus, please bring me
a locomotive and a Boy Scout suit.
And a nice bag of tricks.
Because Tony
is gonna be a very smart boy.
Doesn't a paisano
get walking room around here?
Sorry, Louis.
- Hi, Louis. Need some help?
- Oh, thanks, Tony.
Clumsy basketball players.
Who were you trying to impress?
I don't believe Riordan and Gunn
are going in for corporation law.
Can I let you in on a little secret?
I may not be going
with Riordan and Gunn.
- Heard of Wharton, Biddle and Clayton?
- Who hasn't?
John Marshall Wharton
has decided to write a book...
...on the Sherman Antitrust Act.
He asked the dean to recommend
some bright young man to help him.
- Yeah? How'd he pick you?
- I was kind of surprised myself.
Louis Donetti, a second-generation
Italian, with a Main Line outfit.
The only way I can figure it...
...is you're my competition,
and you're all set.
Of course, Dickinson and Dawes
got dignity, Tony...
...but not like Wharton,
Biddle and Clayton got dignity.
Swell. No kidding. Congratulations.
If I get the job,
we'll be in the same building.
I'll drop down
and buy you lunch, huh?
You mean, it isn't set yet?
Let's not rush. I don't have
my interview till tomorrow.
And you know what?
The lucky guy gets to spend the summer
at the family mansion.
You'll have to give me a course
in what fork to use on Main Line.
- Wish me luck, Tony.
- Yeah.
Mother, do you know
John Marshall Wharton?
No, I don't know him.
I know his wife quite well.
Yes, we've worked on
several committees together.
What's she like?
Well, she's charming
and she's very attractive.
Why do you ask?
Come on in. The door's open.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
You must be the...
I'll be with you in a minute.
I don't get these pictures covered up,
we'll have an inch of dust on them.
It's been... Thank you.
It's been absolute bedlam
around here this morning.
I've got some shoes somewhere.
Never mind. Here you are.
These are the papers
Mr. Wharton wanted.
They're kind of heavy.
And would you mind
dropping these off at the bank?
And this is the check
for the garage.
Car keys.
Give these to Mr. Wharton's secretary.
And these bills are...
Oh, they can figure that out
at the office.
Now, have I remembered everything?
I'm so confused this morning.
Yes, well,
I'm a little confused myself.
Now, what did I do with my shoes?
Here they are.
Thank you.
You know, I think I ought
to give you something in return.
Let me see, this is the list
of symphony donors.
And this is the tentative program
for the charity ball.
- You mean, you're not from the...?
- No, ma'am.
Oh, of course.
You're Mrs. Lawrence's son.
Yes, ma'am. Tony Lawrence.
I'm terribly sorry.
I'll just put these down over here.
Tell Mrs. Wharton, if there's
anything else, just to call my mother?
Yes, I'll tell Mrs. Wharton,
as soon as she puts her shoes on.
You mean, you're...?
Who'd you think I was?
Well, I wasn't sure. I thought
you were Mrs. Wharton's secretary.
See, I've seen Mr. Whar...
I mean...
Well, actually,
it's all my mother's fault.
She never told me anything about you,
and I just didn't...
I didn't know
that you were so young.
- It's so...
- Thank you, I'm very flattered.
Anyway, we're even.
If you'll wait a minute,
I'll look these over.
Sorry the place is a mess...
...but we're moving to the country
for the summer.
You said you've met my husband.
I didn't exactly meet him.
He gave a lecture
at law school last year.
- You studying law?
- Yes, ma'am, I...
- Well, I finish at Penn next June.
- That's very interesting.
I was about to have tea.
Would you like some?
I'd love it.
Another cup, Grace, please,
for Mr. Lawrence.
Yes, ma'am.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
My husband wants to write a book
about the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Oh, really?
Just last week, he was interviewing
a student from the university...
Give them a good walk, Roland.
They'll need it.
- Wasn't that great?
- Great.
They're like little boys
let out of school.
You're like a little girl
let out of school.
- Thought I'd never hear it.
- What?
That's the first
personal thing you've said to me...
...in all the time
you've been staying here.
You lawyers are all alike.
Even at your most charming,
I can hear your legal minds working.
Well, wouldn't you know.
Hello. Back so soon?
- We've had a wonderful afternoon.
- So have I.
Tony, I've been reading your notes
on the Standard Oil decision.
- They're beautifully arranged.
- Thank you.
- Now, I think the next thing...
- That's all for now.
Why do you think I took him riding?
He's been cooped up
with law books 16 hours a day.
That's just the impression
I try to give.
Now that I think it over,
you do look a bit drawn lately.
Don't stay here too long. Remember,
we're having guests for dinner.
- I have to finish...
- You can't get out of it.
A presentable young man
is always an asset at a dinner party.
Well, thank you.
I hope you don't think I've been
complaining about the work.
No, no.
Carol was right.
I've been thoughtless.
Shall we go and dress?
Thank you.
It's been so long since I've danced,
I've almost forgotten how.
Well, it was very pleasant to watch.
I never did learn to dance respectably.
I always used a diagram.
John, you dance beautifully.
Let's have a drink, shall we?
- Tony?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Martinis all right?
- Fine.
Our first guests.
Carter and Joan, to be sure.
Carter Henry is one of the few
young men left in the world...
...who believes
that an 8:00 invitation means 8:00.
Tony?
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Well, well, Joan and Carter.
- Joan, dear. Hello, Carter.
- Carol.
- Have a drink.
- Wonderful. I could use one.
What a lovely dress.
I don't think you've met my assistant.
Tony Lawrence.
Of course, hello.
It's good to see you again.
Nice to see you, Carter.
Joan, look who's here.
Your father didn't say anything about
Tony working for Mr. Wharton.
I suppose I forgot to mention it.
Excuse me.
Carter.
- Martini?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
Well, hello.
Hello, Tony. You're looking well.
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.
I hope you're very happy.
Yes, I am. Are you?
Oh, yes, quite.
I hear you're doing very well.
I think Father was a bit hurt
that you abandoned him so blithely.
I didn't abandon him.
I don't think we ever got started.
Well, it really doesn't matter.
After all, no one could blame you
for taking the better offer.
We all seem to do that
in the long run, don't we?
Would you like a drink?
It's all right. Take it.
It's not... I haven't touched it.
Get you a drink?
Tony.
Tony.
Tony?
You're crazy.
You know that, don't you?
That walk down the hall just now...
...that was the longest walk of my life.
Oh, Tony.
Tony, Tony.
I'd forgotten. I'd really forgotten.
Forgotten what?
How it feels
to be with someone who...
Thank you, Tony,
for not laughing at me.
Let's give ourselves
something to remember, Tony.
- You don't want that.
- Yes, yes.
But I want more.
Don't be greedy.
No, I'm serious.
You take one walk down a hall...
...and you drive me crazy
for the rest of my life.
And you're gonna walk
back there satisfied.
You've got a summer fling
notched onto your riding whip...
...but where does that leave me?
All right.
I can just...
Listen to me. No, listen to me.
You're not the kind of woman
I can use and forget.
You're the kind that I have to have,
to keep and love for as long as I live.
- That's impossible.
- Why is it impossible?
Because I'm younger than you are?
Because I can't give you security?
Because people will talk?
I don't care about that.
Because I can give you
a lot more, Carol.
Get a divorce. Get a divorce.
Please, marry me.
Don't say that.
Don't say that.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't start my life
all over again now.
Oh, but thank you, Tony.
I'm leaving here with something
so much better than I'd hoped to find.
Something wonderful.
Thank you, Tony.
- Morning, Mr. Lawrence.
- Good morning.
- Is Mr. Wharton down?
- Yes, sir. He's in the study, sir.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, Tony.
The mountain has labored
and brought forth a massive pile of print.
Just look at it. A year's work.
Wonder if anybody will be
in the least impressed.
I think they will, sir, if they can lift it.
Right you are. Well, anyway, Tony,
you've been a great help.
I am not unaware of the fact
that there have been certain...
...undercurrents in our relationship.
Neither you nor I, of course,
wish to discuss them.
I merely wish to point out
that you handled yourself very well.
Among other things,
you've tactfully refrained from asking...
...whether you'd be invited into the firm
of Wharton, Biddle and Clayton.
The way I figured it, sir, is...
...whether I'm invited or not,
I've gotten a good legal experience...
...and it's been a privilege
working with you.
You always know
the right thing to say, don't you?
Well, I must warn you
that advancement will be a bit slow.
I'll do what I can, but I can't override
the firm policies.
And they can be very irritating
to an impatient young lawyer.
I've given that
some consideration, sir...
...and it occurred to me
that I might specialize in taxes.
It's a comparatively new field
and there wouldn't be much competition.
Very interesting thinking.
I'll arrange an office
for you next week.
I only hope you'll be able to use it.
- Thanks, corporal.
- My pleasure, lieutenant.
Know if there's a fellow
name of Gwynn in there?
I don't know, lieutenant.
You got a guy
by the name of Gwynn?
- Oh, yes. Over there.
- Thanks.
Hey. Hey, it's me, Tony.
- Hi.
- How are you?
I'm great.
I didn't know you were in the area.
A corpsman called me.
I told him to.
I thought maybe you could wangle me
a nice cushy job in Division.
Sure. If you don't mind
wasting the best years of your life...
...typing out two-bit court-martials.
You'd fit in great anyway.
I mean, nobody up there can spell.
If you give me your little black book,
maybe I can get Zelda to comfort you.
Sort of a private's privilege.
Come on. I'm PFC, you slob.
I beg your pardon?
Sir.
The corpsman told me...
How's your arm?
Well, it went its way...
...I went mine.
They carried it out
a little while ago.
That would be a funny picture
at the Cricket Club.
With two-headed Zelda
and the one-armed drunk.
That's the worst part of it,
it was my drinking arm.
Quite a gathering of the clan
over here in Korea.
Carter's around here somewhere.
Carter? No kidding.
What for? He could have
gotten out of it easy enough.
- Well, maybe he didn't want to.
- What do you mean?
I got this letter from Joan.
I don't know, maybe I was just
reading between the lines.
- Can I have a drag of that?
- Oh, sure.
Hey, ready to go?
Mush.
You want anything
before you leave?
I'm half-asleep already.
Clean this thing up quick
and come home, will you?
No one wants to clean it up
quicker than I do.
No, I mean it.
They're gonna get
their hooks into me again.
- I'll need a friend.
- I'll be there, Chet.
Honest. I'll be there.
Just take it easy. And take care.
- Okay, you take care yourself.
- I will.
Good.
- Tony!
- Tony!
- What are you blubbering about?
- Because I'm so glad he's here.
Been carrying on
ever since we got your wire.
Everybody's been asking for you.
There was an article in the newspaper.
Cost me a case of whiskey
to a reporter I know.
Give me that baggage check.
I'll get us out of here.
One thing.
Have you heard from Chet?
Well, he did call
when he got out of the hospital.
But that was months ago.
I think he's out of town.
No one seems to know.
Thank you, Nancy. I will.
Excuse me.
- Hello, Joan.
- Hello, Tony.
I read that you were coming back.
Are you coming in or going out?
- No, I'm going to Montevideo.
- It's a long way from Maryland.
Excuse me, Mrs. Henry.
Here are your ticket and passport.
I think that should take care
of everything.
Our Montevideo office arranged
your accommodations.
Someone will meet you wherever you
stop, in case you should need anything.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Where's Carter? Isn't he back yet?
Tony, Carter was killed
a month ago on a mission.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean, I'm really sorry.
I liked him.
So did I.
You going to be gone long?
I really don't know
what my plans are, Tony.
Well, it's been lovely
seeing you again.
Oh, yes.
It's been lovely seeing you too.
United Airlines final call
at Main Liner flight 718...
... departing from
the west concourse, gate 22.
All aboard, please.
- Everything all set?
- Sure, the car's waiting.
What's next? You gonna
take it easy for a while?
No, I'm going right back to work.
I'm checking in at
Wharton, Biddle and Clayton...
...while they still think I'm a hero.
Good idea?
Eighth floor. Going down.
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.
- Merry Christmas to you too.
- Mr. Lawrence.
- Yes?
I have something for you.
Mr. Clayton called from Miami.
He'd like you to make the changes
in the Bannerman brief...
...and mail it out to him
tomorrow evening.
Tomorrow?
I thought tomorrow was Christmas.
He said he was sorry,
but he's joining the Bannermans...
...and he'd like to read it over
before he discusses it.
All right.
Oh, I forgot.
He asked me to wish you
a merry Christmas.
Well, if he calls back, tell him
I hope he has a very nice cruise.
Come in.
- Hey, Louis.
- Well, what's this?
I thought the big shots
went home early today.
Well, come on in.
What are you doing here?
One of my firm's clients...
...has business dealings
with one of your firm's clients.
That's shocking.
We'll have to do something.
Send a memo to somebody.
- Well, how you doing, pal?
- Oh, fine, fine.
Yeah, so I see.
Louis, well, you know how it is.
It's a law factory.
It takes a little time.
A little time?
You've been back quite a while.
I thought surely you'd have
a four-room suite by now.
- Would you keep your feet off the...?
- Sorry.
You know,
I really dropped in to thank you.
Oh, yeah? For what?
For what?
For euchring me out of this job.
- Look, Louis, I didn't...
- Oh, come on, Tony. No denials.
I don't know how you managed it,
but you did me a favor.
Boy, can you imagine me
in this high-class graveyard?
Over at Riordan and Gunn,
a man can get somewhere...
...before his arteries turn to marble.
- I know. I read about the Macelli trial.
- I've even taken to dabbling in politics.
I'm working with an old friend
of yours.
A big Irishman named Flanagan.
Oh, yeah? He's a great guy.
You ought to drop down
to see us sometime.
South Side Political Club.
Mingle with the masses, Tony.
We could use a big corporation lawyer
on our side.
Okay. Okay.
You've made your point, Louis.
Oh, come on, Tony.
Cheer up. Cheer up.
Fifty-thousand-a-year client
may walk in any day.
Not through that door.
Those kind of clients are reserved
for the seniors.
Well, Tony, if I find an old client
around I can't use...
...l'll send him over
for old times' sake.
If it's one of Macelli's friends,
don't bother.
Please.
Macelli's friends are all dead.
Merry Christmas, chum.
"Merry Christmas, chum."
Merry Christmas.
Thomas, Thomas, Thomas.
I just don't know.
I just don't know.
- I beg your pardon?
- I beg your...
- I thought you were speaking to me.
- No, no, I was speaking to Carlos.
- Carlos?
- This is Carlos.
- Oh, I see.
- Unfortunately, he's no help.
He can't read.
I was looking for a lawyer.
- A lawyer?
- Yes.
You don't happen to know one,
do you?
Yes. Yes, I believe...
I believe I can recommend one.
Oh, well, I'd like an honest one.
Oh, this man is beyond reproach.
Now, you just go up to the eighth floor
and ask for Mr. Lawrence.
- Thank you.
- How do you do?
I was beginning to think
no one was practicing law...
...in Philadelphia anymore.
I want to add a codicil to my will.
I want it done right away.
Will you do it?
Why, yes.
- Won't you sit down. Miss Lorry.
- Thank you.
Now, then,
may I have your name, please?
I'm Mrs. J. Arthur Allen,
and this is Carlos.
How do you do, Carlos?
When I got up this morning,
Carlos came bounding in to greet me.
I suddenly wondered...
...what would happen to him
if I weren't here?
The servants
would look after him for a while.
But after that, what?
Oh, the servants?
Yes. Oh, well,
Cook and Alice don't like dogs.
But all the others just adore him.
Excuse me just a second.
- Miss Lorry.
- Certainly.
Would you take care of this for me,
please? Thank you very much.
Now, then, as you were saying...
It may seem a little thing to you,
Mr. Lawrence...
...but Carlos means a lot to me.
I want to be sure he goes to someone
who will love him and appreciate him.
I think you're quite right.
Anyway, I took the train in this morning
and walked over here.
Here? Do you mean our offices?
Oh, no. I went to my own
lawyer's office first.
But everybody was out
that knew me or that I knew.
And they had
the most stupid girl there.
She was at the desk.
She didn't even know me.
So I went down to the lobby,
and that nice Mr. Onetti...
Donetti, he spoke to me.
Do you mind if I ask,
who is your lawyer?
Gilbert Dickinson
of Dickinson and Dawes.
- Perhaps you know them?
- Oh, yes, indeed I do.
Would you like me to call him
and explain to him that you're here?
Well, I don't know why you should.
Excuse me.
- Hello?
- Hello, Tony.
I was just leaving the office
and your secretary stopped me.
I hear you have quite a visitor.
For your information,
Mrs. J. Arthur Allen is a director...
...and principal owner
of the Allen Oil Company.
So you have between 50
and 100 million sitting across from you.
Tony, you there?
Oh, yes, sir.
Hello, fella. Hello, hello.
Yes, sir?
Are you aware that Dickinson
and Dawes are her attorneys?
Yes, sir.
- Have you notified them she's here?
- No, sir.
- Well, did you suggest doing so?
- Yes, sir.
So that there will be
no misunderstanding...
...l'll try to get
Gilbert Dickinson on the phone.
Yes, I understand, sir. Thank you.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, that's quite all right.
After all, Carlos doesn't like
everybody, you know.
Oh, really?
Oh, him is such
a sweet little doggy.
Miss Lorry, for the codicil, I'd like an
original and four carbons, please.
- Who do you want Carlos to go to?
- To my niece.
Well, actually,
my niece by marriage.
Mrs. Carter Henry.
Is Mrs. Henry residing now
in Philadelphia?
Oh, yes, 16 Rittenhouse Square.
Did you get that?
Carlos will be very happy
with Joan.
I can't understand how people
can be so callous about animals.
It's a good thing we have the SPCA
to look after dogs and things.
I give them 5000 a year.
Well, that's very generous of...
- In cash?
- Well, of course, how else?
I don't know, it was just a thought.
Don't be coy, young man.
How else could I do it?
Mrs. Allen, now,
I don't mean to pry...
...but I assume
you have some stock.
General Motors, General Electric,
something like that.
Well, doesn't everyone?
Well, let's say
that a small block of stock...
...was purchased some years ago
at $ 1000...
...and today it's worth $5000.
If you were to sell that stock...
...you'd have to pay
a capital-gains tax on it.
- Disgraceful.
- Yes, it is.
See, why don't you give the stock
to the SPCA?
They'd get full value.
They don't pay taxes.
They're a nonprofit organization.
And you'd get the full deduction...
...because you're making
a charitable contribution.
In short, you'd just be saving yourself
paying taxes on $4000 profit.
Well, why haven't those idiots
in the Dickinson office told me all that?
They don't like to sit down...
...and chat with me
like you've been doing.
Let's chat some more, shall we?
Well, here you are, Mrs. Allen.
Oh, thank you so much.
You've been so kind.
Oh, my dear Mrs. Allen.
I was upset about
what happened in our office.
- Quite all right.
- We have a new girl at the desk.
Day before Christmas.
I was at the club.
The moment Mr. Wharton
called me...
But I've been beautifully looked after
by this nice young man.
Hello, Tony. Good to see you again.
Yes, it's nice
to see you again too, sir.
Mr. Lawrence and I are old friends.
I was his preceptor at law school.
I'm not surprised
he's done a good job for you.
If he was so good, it was stupid of you
to let him go, wasn't it?
Well, it's just one of those things.
Well, Mrs. Allen,
if you'll come down to my office.
Yes. Goodbye, and thank you so much
for helping me with that other matter.
- What other matter?
- Oh, it was nothing important.
Well, if you have any more ideas
for saving me money...
...I hope you will let me know.
Mrs. Allen, I'm quite sure that
Mr. Dickinson gives your affairs...
...his closest attention.
And it would be improper conduct
on my part...
...if I suggested that I could
do something that he can't.
- Thank you, Tony.
- Very high-minded of you, I'm sure.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Oh, excuse me.
Mrs. Allen, this is Mr. Wharton.
Of course. I'm so sorry.
Why don't you build this boy
a bigger office?
I've been suffocating ever
since I've been in here.
Well, you sank the harpoon
very neatly.
Why, I thought I conducted myself
quite properly, sir.
Technically, yes.
Mrs. Allen has a chance
to think it over...
...and she may ask
for an explanation.
And then Dickinson will explode.
Well, that should make
quite a noise.
He knew perfectly well
what he was doing.
Elderly ladies
have a phobia about taxes.
They rise to any bait.
Come, now. I heard what Tony said.
What do you want him to do?
I want him to write a note
to Mrs. Allen...
...stating that he does not know of
any further ways to save her money...
...and the whole thing
was a regrettable misunderstanding.
How do you feel about that, Tony?
Well?
I don't think I care to write
that kind of a letter.
What?
It would be dishonest of me
if I said that I didn't know...
...of any further ways
to save Mrs. Allen money.
You'll prove that, or I'll bring you
before the Committee of Censors.
Accusing me of incompetence!
No need to bring the bar into this.
I challenge him to repeat that statement
or prove it in the presence of Mrs. Allen.
I'll have her in this office
at 10:00 tomorrow.
Well...
I didn't interfere, Tony. I hope you know
the chance you're taking.
- lf this should prove embarrassing...
- Yes, I know, sir.
If it does, you won't have
to ask for my resignation.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.
Miss Lorry.
- Yes, sir?
- Get me information on Mrs. Allen.
When her husband died,
when the will was probated...
...any business enterprises.
Anything financial
that you can lay your hands on.
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Get me Mike Flanagan first,
at the South Side Political Club.
Is there anything wrong,
Mr. Lawrence?
Oh, yes. I just took a plunge...
...and I don't know whether
there's any water in the pool.
It's all right, Marvin,
you'll get your turkey.
- Flanagan.
- Mr. Anthony Lawrence, sir.
- Oh, sure. Yeah, put him on.
- Hello, Mike? Tony.
Hello, Tony.
- How are you doing, boy?
- Well, I'm not so sure.
But I wanna ask you a favor.
That's the first time in your life
you ever done that.
Is it legal or illegal?
It's illegal. I'm really in a jam.
Know anybody at County Records?
I gotta get some information.
I don't want anybody to know
that I'm nosing around.
- How soon you have to have it?
- Tonight.
You don't ask for the easy ones,
do you?
I'll see what I can do.
You get yourself over here.
Thanks. I already got my coat on.
- Yes, sir?
- Get me Barney Hale.
- I guess he had too much to drink.
- Well, clap him up again.
Oh, there you are.
I'm terribly sorry I'm late.
That's quite all right.
You know my niece, I'm sure.
- Tony.
- Oh, yes, we know each other.
I hope you don't mind
my bringing Joan.
She has a wonderful head for money,
almost as good as I do.
And I can't think of anyone
who would be more impartial.
Thank you.
You like to sit down, Joan?
Mrs. Allen, I don't know how
Mr. Dickinson has presented this to you.
Well, you boasted
you could save her money.
Either support that statement
or apologize.
We ought to get one thing straight.
I didn't boast.
You came to me with a challenge.
It was at your suggestion
this meeting was called.
If you have something to say,
please say it.
You're absolutely right.
Let's get down to business.
Now, then.
Mrs. Allen, what I'm going to say
to you may sound devious...
...but believe me, it isn't.
It's perfectly legal and aboveboard.
You're a Pennsylvania resident.
If you own stock in a corporation...
...which does not do business
in this state...
...you have to pay
a county personal-property tax.
If you own stock in a corporation
which does business in this state...
...and which pays taxes here...
...that stock is not subject
to the same tax.
Mrs. Allen, you own $50,000,000 worth
of stock in the Allen Oil Company...
...which is exclusively
a New Jersey corporation.
And as a result, you pay
$200,000 a year taxes on that stock.
You're telling us something
we're aware of.
She has to pay. That's the law.
Yes, I do. The county assessor
is a very pleasant man...
...but he won't let me get away
with anything.
Well, why don't we arrange it
differently?
What are you getting at?
Simply this:
Mrs. Allen also owns or controls
several Pennsylvania corporations.
It would be a very simple matter...
...to transfer some of the activities
of the Allen Oil Company...
...so that they can take over
operation...
...of any one of these
Pennsylvania concerns.
As a result, the Allen Oil Company
would be doing business in Pennsylvania.
Corporate taxes would come out
of the same pants, different pockets.
Mrs. Allen personally
would save $200,000 a year.
Well! Well, did you...?
Did you hear that, Gilbert?
My dear Mrs. Allen,
this is a wild and reckless idea.
What's more, it's interference
in company policy.
You wouldn't use
your voting powers...
...to force the officers
to do such a crazy juggling act.
Oh, wouldn't I?
Of course, I don't quite
understand it all. Do you, Joan?
Yes, I do.
Mr. Lawrence is using Pennsylvania
taxes on corporations...
...to knock out
your county personal-property tax.
Oh, I see.
Mrs. Allen, we've always devoted
our best efforts to your interests.
Nobody disputes that, Gilbert.
You don't have to patronize me.
When time comes that a cub lawyer...
...and my daughter tell me
I'm deficient in my duties...
I didn't say that, Father.
You're a good lawyer.
Everybody knows that.
It's just that you're not
a tax specialist.
And it's obvious
Tony has become one.
Well, what about that, Gilbert?
Mrs. Allen, we'll turn over your affairs
to anyone you care to name.
Well, imagine Gilbert acting like that.
I hope you're not offended, Joan.
No. No, I'm just sorry Father is.
- Yes, well, what do I do now?
- Well...
Well, I think you just hired yourself
a new lawyer.
Yes, I suppose I have.
Well, do you want me
to sign something?
No, we'll draft a letter immediately
to cover all the formalities.
Good. Let's have lunch.
Talking about money
always makes me hungry.
Oh, by the way, young man...
...I don't suppose I could get a refund
for past years, could I?
No, I'm afraid not.
I was afraid you'd say "afraid not."
Oh, Joan...
...could I speak to you for a second?
Thank you for...
There's no need to thank me.
I think you handled the whole thing
brilliantly.
You're on your way now.
That should make you very happy.
It would make me a lot happier...
...if you'd take some of the edge
off your voice.
I'm sorry,
I didn't realize there was any.
Well, there was.
I don't see why we have to go on
hurting each other.
I'll try to remember to be nicer
if we meet in the future.
Joan, please.
Now, I want very much to see you.
It's no use, Tony.
I'm an institution now.
I came back to Philadelphia...
...because I had a responsibility
to Carter's family.
I didn't do a very good job
as his wife.
Maybe I can do a better one
as his widow.
Well, what about your responsibility
to yourself?
Joan, that day at the airport...
...I don't know how you felt,
but it made...
I just... Well, maybe we can never
really get back together again...
...but at least we won't be alone.
All right, Tony...
...we'll see each other if you like.
But please don't expect too much.
I won't.
I'll call you on Friday.
Eighth floor, going down.
I don't have to tell you people read
about you in the papers.
You work on this committee,
that committee.
- You're getting well-known.
- Even heard about you on the South Side.
All right, you guys didn't come up here
to throw roses at me.
What's the point?
Point is you're in the position now
to do something...
...besides making a lot of money
and being one of the social lions.
We want you to run
for the city council.
- What do you mean, go into politics?
- Sure.
- I don't know the first thing about it.
- It's time you did, then.
That goes for the crowd
you're running with too.
Philadelphia has been sitting back
on its fat traditions.
This town's starting
to perk up and look around.
It's gonna go places, Tony.
Thought you might want
to help it get there.
That would've meant a lot to you
at one time, wouldn't it?
It still does, Mike. It's just...
There'd be a few things
I'd have to work out.
I'd have to give up
part of my practice.
Well, sure,
you gotta figure on that.
Louis gave up
a soft touch at Riordan and Gunn...
...to take a two-bit job
in the DA's office.
I was getting fat.
Where I sit, where I think.
Maybe you know the feeling, pal.
That was a little bit different.
That's right, it was different.
I didn't have any
social position to lose.
Mike, I told you he wouldn't go for it.
On Main Line,
politics is a dirty word.
He can't afford to antagonize
those high-class clients of his.
I don't know about that.
You used to be
pretty independent, Tony.
I remember you wanted to be
a big success so you could do things.
Well, this is your chance.
The council's only the beginning.
- Excuse me. Yes?
- Mrs. Henry on line one.
Oh, thank you.
Joan?
I'm calling to remind you
about dinner.
- You'll be on time, won't you?
- Oh, sure.
Would you hang on a minute?
I got some people in the office.
Mike, look. Let me think it over,
and I'll call you.
- Sure.
- Don't bother, chum.
I know a brushoff when I hear one.
He's gotta argue it out
with himself, that's all.
- Hi, back again.
- I hope I didn't break in on anything.
No, Mike was up here
with some other fella.
They mentioned something about
running for city council.
- You know, civic virtue and all that.
- I see.
Well, I'll expect you at 8:30.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Yeah.
- Good evening, Mr. Thomas.
- Good evening.
- Hello, dear.
- Hello. You look lovely.
- Thank you.
- What's all this about?
The family wanted to meet you.
I thought this was as good a time as any.
Curiosity or inspection?
A little of both, I guess.
- Hello, Tony.
- Good evening, sir.
- Nice to see you again.
- Same here.
You know,
when Joan invited me tonight...
...I hesitated for a moment.
But after thinking it over...
...I realized it was foolish
to carry a grudge.
Shall we...?
Shall we bury the hatchet?
Oh, fine, sir.
So long as it's not in each other.
Well, here you are at last.
Everyone's here to meet you,
including some I thought were dead.
Joan, dear, do you mind
if I take him around and introduce him?
After all, I did discover him.
Or shall I say, "rediscovered him"?
- My pleasure.
- Bless you.
I'm very happy
you two are together again, my dear.
- Are you, Father?
- Yes, indeed.
In fact, I was wondering,
in the event you should decide to...
Do you suppose Tony would consider
coming back into the firm again?
I don't know, Father.
Why don't you ask him?
Excuse me.
- Carla Henry.
- Adelaide.
- Anthony Lawrence.
- Pleased to meet you.
She's on the wrong side of the Henrys.
Don't bother stealing her business.
And of course
you know Dr. Shippen Stearnes.
- Yes. Nice to see you again, sir.
- Anthony Lawrence.
You've come a long way
since last we met.
What would your grandmother
say if she could see you tonight?
- I hope she'd be very pleased, sir.
- I'm sure she would.
- Here you are, Shippen.
- Thank you.
You remember Anthony Lawrence,
don't you, Morton?
Yes, you were Chester's roommate,
weren't you?
Yes, sir, I was. I was just wondering,
have you heard from him lately?
To my regret.
I wrote to him in California
and I didn't get an answer.
Right. He was there for a while.
Chester Gwynn, that bad boy?
The one I liked so much?
What ever happened to him?
If I wasn't concerned for the good name
of this family, I'd tell you.
- Morton.
- Well, it's disgraceful, Shippen.
You needn't concern yourself
any longer with the matter.
- lf I don't, who will?
- It will be handled by someone else.
Perhaps Tony could help us out.
Of course, if you don't have
confidence in me.
That's not the point
at the moment.
We can discuss this in private.
Everyone knows
that you've trusted me...
...to carry out your wishes
concerning this family.
Now suddenly you've decided
that I'm incompetent.
I do not wish to discuss the matter
any further.
You'll excuse me.
I'm sorry, Joan. I can't stay for dinner.
I've got a terrible headache.
I hope you'll forgive this little incident.
Morton hasn't been well lately.
Is there something the matter
with Chet, sir?
Suppose you call me tomorrow,
and we can talk about it.
Oh, yes, please do.
Let's not have any more arguments.
It's so bad for the digestion.
- Tony?
- Yeah.
- Well, it's late.
- I've been walking.
Did you have a nice time
at the party?
- Tell me about it.
- I will in the morning, Mother.
Tony.
Is there anything wrong?
You didn't quarrel with Joan, did you?
No. As a matter of fact,
we'll probably get married.
Oh, darling,
I think that's wonderful.
It's all worked out beautifully,
hasn't it?
It has. Well, I'm tired.
- Hello?
- Forty-second Precinct calling.
- Is Mr. Lawrence in?
- Yes, he is. Just a moment, please.
It's the police station.
- Hello?
- Mr. Lawrence?
This is Sergeant McMahan.
I'm sorry to trouble you...
...but we've got a man in the drunk tank
that keeps insisting he knows you.
Yeah, his name is Howard Clark.
Howard Clark? I never heard of him.
Well, I didn't think you did.
But I felt sorry for the poor guy.
He's a sad case, only one arm and all.
Sergeant, I'll be right down.
- Tony, what is it?
- I'll call you later, Mother.
That's him right there.
The one against the wall.
Chet?
Hey. Hey, Chet.
Sorry.
All right, Clark. Let's go.
Come on, let's get out of here.
The name's Howard Clark, you know.
Oh, hi, Tony.
Are you this guy's attorney?
No, just a friend. Why?
When a big society lawyer
comes down...
...to haul a wino out of the bear pit,
the building buzzes.
I hear the grapevine,
and I get to wondering.
Could one-arm Clark also be a social type
known as Chester A. Gwynn?
Cut it out, now. Can't you see he's sick?
Come on, Chet.
- Wait a minute.
- I'm afraid he's gonna get a lot sicker.
We put out an all-points on Gwynn
an hour ago.
I'm holding him for the murder
of Morton Stearnes.
- Murder?
- Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Mr. Grant,
I told you reporters last night...
...that Mr. Gwynn
is a personal friend of mine.
I do not represent him.
I have nothing to say.
Hello.
- Good morning, Dr. Stearnes.
- Good morning, Tony.
I'm sorry you had to get
involved in all this.
I wanted you to know the family
will do everything possible for Chet.
Now, we've contacted two
of the best criminal lawyers in the city.
And we should have one of them
on the job by this afternoon.
Did...?
Did he have much to say
to you last night?
He wasn't in much condition
to say anything.
We had to call a police doctor
to give him a sedative.
I'm on my way down there
right now.
I wonder if it's wise
for you to do that.
I mean, before the trial lawyer
has a chance to talk to him.
Isn't there a possibility of confusion
and conflicting statements?
There's no reason for me
to make a statement.
I'm going there
because he expects to see me.
Well, please remember that whatever
Chet has to say at this point...
...should be taken with a grain of salt.
Will you call me
after you talk to him?
Oh, yes, sir. I certainly will.
- Is that you, Tony?
- Yeah.
I didn't think you'd get here.
I didn't know what time it was.
They took my watch.
Okay, take it easy.
Look, now, you did tell them?
You told them that this was crazy?
I mean, they can't make me
say I killed him.
They can't make a man say
he did something he didn't.
They can't make you say anything.
Now, just simmer down.
I'm sorry, but it's just that I have
to know something right now.
- What is going to happen to me?
- I'll tell you, Chet, if you'd quiet down.
You can't sit here and think about
whether you'll live or die.
- Somebody has gotta help me!
- Okay, we will. We will.
Now, then, your uncle called
this morning...
- Shippen?
- Yeah. He said he got two...
- I don't want him.
- Listen, Chet.
- He's got the best criminal lawyers...
- I don't want them. I want you.
I know you've had trouble
with him before...
...but that's not...
- No, no. Please, Tony.
Chet, would you be sensible?
Now, look, I am a corporation lawyer.
The only thing
I really know about is taxes.
If they shove me into a criminal court,
I'll get slaughtered.
I'm scared of Shippen, Tony.
I'm really scared.
He's gonna buy a lot of big legal names
and pay them to get rid of me.
All he's worried about is me
stinking up the family name.
Like when he stole my inheritance
and took away my name.
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
he stole your inheritance?
It was all perfectly legal. You see...
...the money from my parents
wasn't to come directly to me.
It was to go to Morton
for him to pass on to me.
When I got back from Korea,
they didn't want a cripple around.
So they dumped me
in one of their companies...
...with this little toy job
and little toy salary.
Well, I just couldn't stand it.
So I said, "Will you please
give me what belongs to me...
...and I'll go my way?"
And they said,
"No. That's not in your best interest."
See, they weren't gonna let this
million and a half slip out of their hands.
Well...
Then I did a lot of things. I don't know.
I guess I sort of went crazy.
I signed this check
with Morton's name on it.
It was just a little check,
but they were out to get me.
They said, "We'll prosecute
and really hang you up...
...unless you get out of town."
So I went to L.A.
Well, I didn't know
what to do there.
And that's when I really started
with the boozing.
And then I got sick,
and my landlady took care of me.
She fed me, and I guess
she really saved my life.
Then she had this terrible accident,
and she needed an operation.
So I wrote to Morton,
I sent him a telegram, and I said:
"Please send me some money
to help her."
Well, he sent back a 2-cent postcard...
...and he said,
"You take care of your own floozy."
Oh, my God. "Floozy"?
Tony, she was 73 years old.
Well, I didn't know what to do,
and I decided to hitchhike back here.
I thought if I could see him
face to face, I could explain.
So I called him first, and I didn't get
two words out of my mouth...
...and he hung up on me.
I mean, he didn't care, Tony.
He never did. None of them did.
And they don't care now, Tony.
And believe me, they have
a lot more reason to dump me now...
...than they ever had before.
Okay, okay. I get the picture.
All right.
Chet, okay.
Now, I don't know how I'm gonna
help you, but I'll do the best I can.
It's just that, well,
I gotta lay it on the line.
It's not gonna be easy.
The DA's got enough stuff...
But you gotta level with me.
You gotta tell me everything you know.
All right.
Now, you did go
to Morton's house last night?
- Yes.
- Did you have a gun?
Yes, I bought one
right after I came here.
Why, Chet?
Why did you buy a gun?
To kill myself.
As soon as I got back here,
I called my landlady...
...to see how she was.
And she had died.
I mean, she didn't even get
to a hospital.
And I had promised her.
After I found out about that
is when I bought the gun.
And I took it up to my room,
and then I couldn't get up enough nerve.
Wait a minute.
Here's a copy of a letter
they found in Morton's desk.
"Better not hang up
the next time I call.
I've got something
to use on you now.
Be ready to talk about money
or you'll be sorry."
- Did you write that?
- I wrote it.
After you bought the gun?
Well, yeah, but I didn't mean the gun,
I meant the woman.
- What woman?
- Morton's.
There has never in his life been a time
that he wasn't keeping one.
But he always knew how to cover up.
So this time, I followed him,
and I found the one that he had now.
And, brother, I'm telling you,
she was a pig, a real pig.
And she was married too.
That's what I meant
that I was gonna use.
Then why did you take a gun
to the house?
I just wanted to get something,
have him give me something.
Scare, money.
It didn't make any difference.
- So, what happened when you got there?
- Well, I guess I was pretty tanked up.
I know that I'd stopped at quite
a few bars to get my courage up.
And I think I bought a bottle.
Yeah, I know I did.
Well, then the butler let me in.
Or somebody did.
Anyway, Morton wasn't there.
And then I fell asleep...
...because the next thing I remember
was awakening...
...and I looked up, and there was Morton
looking down at me, and he was yelling.
And then it was all just, you know,
slow motion and noise.
Yeah, but what kind of noise?
It was just loud.
- Loud? Like a shot?
- Just loud.
- Did the gun go off?
- I don't know. It might have.
You gotta remember about the gun.
There were fingerprints,
yours and Morton's, powder burns.
- lf the gun went off accidentally, that...
- I don't know.
All I remember
is something cold like iron.
A gate and a clang.
I don't know, Tony.
I swear, I just don't know.
And it's all I remember.
Please, please, Tony. Please.
- Lawrence.
- Oh, hello, Robert.
- Oh, Mr. Lawrence.
- Yes?
Dr. Stearnes and Mrs. Henry
are waiting in your office.
That's interesting. Thank you.
- Tony.
- Afternoon, sir.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look tired.
I've been in the DA's office
the whole afternoon.
I understand that you know
this deputy of his quite well.
- Will that be of any help?
- No, sir.
He's gonna ask for an indictment
for murder, and he's gonna get it.
Unless whoever represents Chet
can prove...
...that there were
extenuating circumstances.
This may come
as a surprise to you, Tony...
...but I've consulted
with various members of the family...
...and we've decided that you should
handle Chet's case personally.
That is a surprise. Do you mind if I ask
on what basis that decision was made?
- Well...
- Chet refused to see Dr. Ship's lawyer.
He sent out word he'd have nothing
to do with any lawyer the family hired.
I see.
I imagine Chet told you
a great many things.
Yes, sir, he did.
But, Tony, you must remember
there are two sides to every story.
Oh, I'm aware of that.
Just... I'm sorry, sir.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
From the questions this Donetti
has been asking...
...it appears he intends to extract
every ounce of sensationalism...
...from the case.
In a sense, to put the Philadelphia
way of life on trial.
That's why we want a lawyer
who is interested in justice...
...rather than headlines.
Justice for whom, sir?
For everyone concerned.
A great many people
will be affected by this case.
The stigma already touches
every member...
...of the Stearnes and Henry family.
There's no need to add more.
Oh, I know you're fond of Chet.
So is Joan.
But sometimes the individual
is less important than the whole.
After all, the boy is guilty.
There are degrees of guilt.
Chet's condition when he went
to the house.
The things that have been
done to him over the years.
All those things are important
in affecting the sympathy of a jury.
Surely you're skillful enough
to find a way to help him...
...without splashing mud
on the names of innocent people.
Doctor, this is Chet's life
we're talking about.
Oh, hardly that.
In his pathetic condition,
his war record and injury alone...
...no jury would vote
the death penalty.
After the trial...
Well, we have some influence
in this state.
Later, we can have him removed
to some more proper institution...
...and adequately cared for.
In other words, if I can get him off
without a scandal, fine. If not...
I expect you to do everything you can
to help him.
And I have high hopes you'll succeed.
I also expect you to conduct yourself
as a lawyer...
...who has won the respect
of the best families in Philadelphia.
A respect without which
you would not be in the position...
...you enjoy today.
Here, darling. Relax and drink this.
And try not to think about it
for a few minutes.
I wish I could.
After you left, I got a half a dozen calls
from top clients...
...saying how glad they were
that somebody trustworthy...
...was handling the case.
Ship really spread it around town...
...that I was willing
to play footsie, didn't he?
Let's not talk about it
until after dinner.
I've cooked a pot roast to prove
I'm not a failure at domestic science.
And we're gonna have
a nice, quiet evening at home.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm not in the witness stand.
I don't know what Shippen did.
- You were with him.
- Because he asked me.
I wanted to hear
what he had to say.
Any more questions,
or can I swear in the pot roast?
- But you agreed with him?
- Of course I didn't agree with him.
- Well, you just sat there. You...
- Well, what did you expect me to do?
This thing is really getting
to me now. I'm sorry.
Come here.
Darling, I have been thinking.
Perhaps you ought to withdraw
from the case.
- When did you get that bright idea?
- No, Tony. I mean it.
I'll hire the lawyer for Chet.
He'll be paid by me.
But any instructions he gets
will be from us.
Perhaps we can get somebody
from out of the city.
That way he won't be subjected
to any pressure.
Why, don't you think
I can stand up to it?
Of course you could.
I was proud of the way
you stood up to Shippen.
But it will get worse and worse
every day.
And that's not fair to you.
There's nothing Shippen can do to me.
Even Chet feels the way I do.
Chet does?
What are you talking about?
I went to see him this afternoon
when I could get away from Shippen.
I explained the entire situation to him,
and he agreed.
You must've done plenty of talking
to get him to do that.
Don't get angry, Tony.
The last thing he wants is to put you
in an embarrassing position.
It's Chet we're supposed
to be protecting, not me.
That's what I'm trying to do.
Once, he was the only person
I could turn to.
I wanna do everything I can
to save him.
And you don't trust me
to do it for you?
- We shouldn't have talked about this.
- Now, wait a minute.
Do you think I'd sell him out
in the long run?
This may be the most important thing
I've ever asked you. I want an answer.
Tony, I know you wouldn't
want to or like to.
But have you liked doing what you've
done to make yourself a success?
I'm not criticizing you.
You can't help what you've become.
And just what do you think
I've become?
Wait. Just what do you think
I've become?
- Be careful, Tony.
- You better be careful.
All right, then!
I've seen you
when your mind is made up...
...then something more important
to your future comes along.
- Like what?
- Like 10 years ago.
When you were going to marry me
until my father offered you a better deal.
You're a maneuverer. Buttoned up
on the outside, but on the inside...
Well, if I'm a maneuverer,
you can thank yourself.
You and your maneuvering old man.
You showed me what to do to stay alive
in this rat race, and I learned.
- That's not true.
- You're damn right it's true.
What gives you the real right
to criticize me?
You walked out without looking back.
I don't know what guff
your old man gave you...
...but you must've been ready
to swallow it.
- Didn't even give me a phone call.
- Tony, l...
Just lay off!
Stay away from me and from Chet.
If you ever interfere again, l...
One thing I don't understand.
If you felt this way, how could you
have wanted to marry me?
Tony, l... You don't stop
loving somebody...
...just because they don't live up
to your expectations.
Maybe you don't, Mrs. Henry,
but this cookie does.
- Mrs. Lawrence?
- Yes?
I'm Dr. Shippen Stearnes.
- Of course. Come in, doctor.
- Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me
for dropping in unexpectedly like this.
- That's all right. Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Wait a minute. You both know
how I feel about this case.
Why go on discussing it?
Because you're losing
your sense of proportion.
It's fine to stand up
for a friend and all.
But you're cutting your own throat
in the bargain.
These people are powerful.
They can wreck you.
Well, that's quite a switch.
Few weeks ago, you said a lot
about independence.
Independent's one thing,
bullheaded's another.
You worked to get where you are.
You wanna see it go down the drain?
That's where it should go
if I can't feel free to do what I believe.
There's no way to defend Chet
without attacking the Stearnes family?
To hell with the Stearnes family!
- I asked a question.
- The answer's no.
Even if there was another way,
I'm tired of compromising.
You are? Let me tell you something.
You don't live off on a desert island.
- Your life's tied up with others.
- I don't wanna fight you.
I respect you too much.
But my life is mine.
This doesn't concern
anybody but me.
You're forgetting your mother.
She's given up a lot for you.
- I know, and I've tried to pay her back.
- You can never pay her back.
- Mike, please.
- You keep out of this.
I won't let you sacrifice every principle
you've ever stood for.
Tony, he's only trying
to protect me.
Kate, you...
What's the use, Mike?
He has to know the truth.
What truth?
What truth?
Dr. Stearnes came here today.
He was the executor
of your grandmother's estate...
...and had access to certain information
which he threatens to use against...
Threatens to use what?
Tony...
...your father
was not William Lawrence.
This is quite a moment for me. I...
It probably won't hit me...
...till I wake up
in the middle of the night.
Tony, I'm sorry you had to find out
about it this way.
I thought I was doing
what was best for you.
Oh, I was so wrong.
It's done now, Kate. It's done.
We've got years
to talk about mistakes.
It's right now that's important.
Tony, if it was you and me,
it wouldn't matter much.
But if you put Dr. Stearnes
on the stand...
...and start dragging out
their family skeletons...
...I don't have to tell you what
they'll make out of your mother.
Is there anything you can do?
I don't know.
I don't know.
The trial of Chester Gwynn
moves into its fourth day...
... as Assistant District Attorney Donetti
piles up evidence...
... in what seems to be
an airtight case for the prosecution.
Defense attorney
Anthony Lawrence...
... has remained silent
throughout the proceedings.
But tomorrow's another day,
and the sensational revelations...
... which have still failed to materialize,
may be forthcoming...
... when the prosecution puts
its final witness on the stand:
The butler to the late Morton Stearnes,
George Archibald.
Commonwealth calls its final witness,
Mr. George Archibald.
George Archibald.
Come forward and take the stand.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear the testimony
you're about to give before this court...
...will be the truth,
so help you God?
I do.
- State your name, please.
- George Archibald.
You were butler to Morton Stearnes?
- Yes, sir, I was.
- Thank you.
During that time, you were acquainted
with the defendant, Chester Gwynn?
Yes, sir, quite.
Were you in the Stearnes home
the night of his death?
Yes, sir, I was.
Can you tell us the exact time
of Mr. Gwynn's arrival?
Yes, sir.
I was having a light repast
in the kitchen when the bell rang.
As is my custom, I glanced at the
kitchen clock on my way to answer it.
It was precisely 8:43.
Would you tell the jury,
in your own words...
...what happened then?
The bell continued to ring
until I opened the door...
...and found Mr. Gwynn
leaning against the buzzer.
He was obviously inebriated
and overwrought.
- Had he been to the house recently?
- Oh, no, sir. Not for some years.
See, there had always been bad blood
between Mr. Stearnes and Mr. Gwynn.
Go on, Mr. Archibald.
He was in a truculent mood...
...and told me he intended
to see Mr. Stearnes.
I explained his uncle
would not be back until later...
...but he practically forced his way in.
Then what happened?
I decided it was best to humor him
for the moment.
So I showed him to the study
and offered him a drink.
He said, and these
are his exact words:
"Anything I drink in Morton's house
probably has strychnine in it."
He then pulled a bottle
of very cheap rye from his pocket.
I gave him a glass
from the liquor cabinet...
...and turned the record player on
for him and returned to the kitchen.
A few minutes after 9,
I heard the front door slam.
I hoped he'd gone,
but to my surprise...
...I found Mr. Stearnes
standing in the hallway.
- Well, did you tell him he had a visitor?
- Yes, sir, I did.
He went directly to the study
and closed the doors.
As I returned to the kitchen,
I could hear them quarreling.
- What did you do then?
- I washed the few things I'd been using.
And at 9:31, Mr. Stearnes rang.
He met me at the door of the study
and handed me two glasses.
You see, Mr. Stearnes disliked drinking
from the same glass twice...
...until it had been washed.
In fact, he objected violently to having
empty glasses standing around.
And who had been drinking
from those two glasses?
Mr. Stearnes and Mr. Gwynn.
Mr. Stearnes had had
Royal Tartan Scotch...
...and Mr. Gwynn had been drinking
the cheap rye he had brought.
And how did you know that?
Oh, I sniffed the glasses, sir.
You see, good liquor
has a distinctive bouquet all its own.
In fact, so does bad liquor,
but I'd hesitate to call it "bouquet."
You say you sniffed the glasses.
Why?
For a very practical reason, sir.
In the liquor cabinet,
Mr. Stearnes always kept...
...one bottle of Royal Tartan Scotch,
one of Glen Moray Scotch...
...and a bottle of Napoleon Brandy.
That way, I was able to keep track
of what he was using and replace it.
Oh, I see.
What did you do then?
I had my usual bedtime brandy
in the kitchen.
And at 9:43,
Mr. Stearnes rang again.
This time,
he handed me a single glass.
And who had been drinking
from that glass?
Mr. Gwynn, sir.
The odor was quite unmistakable.
Proceed, Mr. Archibald.
Mr. Stearnes then told me
to go to bed.
And after washing the glass,
I did so.
Did you fall asleep immediately?
Yes, sir. I'm an early riser
and a very sound sleeper.
And you were awakened
by the sound of a shot?
No, sir. Not exactly.
For some reason,
I awoke before that.
I'd been lying there perhaps
five minutes or so when I heard it.
I rushed downstairs immediately.
The French doors
leading to the garden were open.
Mr. Stearnes was lying on the floor,
the gun next to him...
...but Mr. Gwynn had disappeared.
- Then you phoned the police?
- Yes, sir.
And I noted the time as I did so.
It was exactly 10:25.
Thank you very much, Mr. Archibald.
You may cross-examine.
Your Honor, it's already
a few minutes after 12.
And since the prosecution
has based its case largely...
...on the testimony of this one witness,
a cross-examination will take some time.
If Your Honor please...
...I ask permission to extend
the luncheon recess one hour.
Granted. Court's adjourned.
We will reconvene at 2:30.
Mr. Archibald, I must say...
...that I was very impressed
by your testimony this morning.
You're obviously a man
with a remarkable memory...
...and incredible powers
of observation.
- Thank you, sir.
- Now, a few things I'd like to get clear.
On those two occasions
when you went back to the study...
...did you actually see the defendant?
No, sir.
Mr. Stearnes opened the door...
...just wide enough
to hand me the glasses.
Did you hear his voice?
No, sir. Not on those occasions.
Isn't it possible that Mr. Gwynn
had already left...
...and the glasses that Mr. Stearnes
handed you...
...were ones he had used himself?
Quite impossible, sir.
I explained that earlier.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You sniffed them
and identified the cheap rye...
...that Mr. Gwynn had been drinking.
That's a rather remarkable talent.
Would you mind demonstrating it
to the jury?
Objection.
A test of this type
is neither material or relevant.
Your Honor, it is both material
and relevant.
The prosecution has based
its assumption that the defendant...
...was in the study at a crucial time,
not because he was seen or heard...
...but because of this witness's ability...
...to identify various liquors
by their aroma.
Your Honor, it's impossible
to have a fair test...
...in the atmosphere
of a courtroom.
I fail to see how a courtroom
could produce...
...a chemical change in alcohol.
Objection overruled.
- Thank you. Do you mind?
- Not at all, sir.
I have complete faith in my ability to give
the demonstration in any atmosphere.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Mr. Hughes, if you will, please.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
During the recess, my assistant and I
went to a state liquor store...
...and we purchased a bottle
of Glen Moray Scotch...
...a bottle of Royal Tartan Scotch
and a bottle of cheap rye.
The contents were transferred
into those medicine bottles.
They can be identified and introduced
as evidence later, if necessary.
Proceed.
Now, Mr. Archibald, would you test
the bouquet of this liquor, please?
Now, take your time. Don't tell the jury
what it contains until you're certain.
- I'm quite ready, sir.
- Give it a few more tries.
Just to make sure.
There's not a doubt in the world.
I don't know the brand,
but it's definitely a rye...
...with a very short aging period.
Quite cheap, I'd say.
I see.
Now the second glass, labeled "B."
Again, Mr. Archibald,
I caution you, take your time.
I'm quite ready, sir.
Any delay was not due
to confusion on my part...
...but rather because you asked me
to take my time.
It is Royal Tartan Scotch.
Unmistakable.
Rich, heavy bouquet,
with a definite aroma of peat smoke.
Now the third glass.
This is water, sir.
It's water?
Are you sure? Did you smell it?
There is no smell, except perhaps
for a faint touch of chlorine...
...the city puts in its drinking water.
I trust you weren't trying to trick me
into identifying it as liquor.
I don't understand.
You will note there is no label.
I believe you gave me
your water glass.
I'm terribly sorry.
I guess I made a mistake.
Well, perhaps it's not in vain...
...since my throat is a little dry.
You'll pardon me.
It's gin. It's gin. You tricked me.
That's right.
Your Honor, I submit this as Exhibit D.
Objection.
Your Honor, I move
this entire vaudeville act...
...be stricken from the record.
He filled the witness's nose with fumes
so he couldn't smell.
He deliberately
handed him that gin.
If you wanna get up
and testify, go ahead.
I'll be glad to cross-examine you.
If there is another demonstration, I will
have the court cleared of spectators.
Mr. Donetti, if you have been
making an objection...
...it has not been in the form
this court recognizes.
Unless you wish to do so,
cross-examination will proceed.
If Your Honor please...
...l'd like to have entered in the record
my contention...
...that the ability of this witness
to identify gin by smell...
...has nothing to do with his ability
to identify the types of liquor...
...which were drunk
on the night in question.
I further contend
this incident with the gin...
...is immaterial and irrelevant.
On the contrary, Your Honor.
I intend to show that this incident
is far more material...
...and far more relevant...
...than the prosecutor
might even begin to suspect.
Objection overruled.
Proceed.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now, then, Mr. Archibald.
Do you think that the fumes from
the first two glasses that I handed you...
...could have saturated
your sense of smell...
...and lead you
to identify gin as water?
I don't know.
Well, perhaps I did have trouble
identifying the second.
Perhaps it was because of the fumes.
You didn't say that you had
any difficulty.
Would you like
your statement read back?
- No, sir.
- I didn't think you would.
Well, you see...
...I think it is possible that fumes
can confuse the sense of smell.
Well, sir, I saw you pour it
from your water carafe, I assumed...
You assumed!
Now, you testified this morning that
you had just finished a glass of brandy...
...before Mr. Stearnes asked you down
to the study the second time.
You're a connoisseur of liquor...
...and brandy is most appreciated
when sniffed, isn't it?
- That's quite correct.
- In view of the recent test...
...are you still positive that the single
glass Mr. Stearnes handed you...
...contained cheap rye?
Well, it's possible
that I was mistaken...
A few minutes ago, you mistakenly
assumed that gin was water.
You even went so far as to assume
a hint of chlorine.
What else did you
mistakenly assume that night?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
You testified that you were awakened
five minutes before the shot was fired.
- Yes, sir.
- You testified you were a sound sleeper.
- Do you awaken often in the night?
- No, sir.
Then something
must have awakened you.
- I guess so.
- A sound.
Yes, sir.
Where is your room in relation
to the rest of the house?
The third floor.
- Anybody else occupy the third floor?
- No, sir.
Your room is too far from the study
to hear anything from there?
I couldn't hear voices...
If the sound didn't come from the inside,
where did it come from?
- Do you sleep with your windows open?
- Yes.
- Do your windows face the garden?
- Yes, sir.
Could the sound that awakened you...
...have been the sound
of a clanging garden gate?
A sound made by the defendant
as he left the house?
Five minutes
before the shot was ever fired?
- I don't know, sir.
- Objection!
Calls for a conclusion
on the part of the witness.
Counsel is putting words
in his mouth.
Is it possible the boy didn't do it?
Your Honor, at this time, the defense
wishes to call to the stand...
...Dr. Shippen Stearnes.
Dr. Shippen Stearnes,
come forward, please.
Tony's taking a terrible chance,
putting Shippen on the stand.
- How do you mean?
- Shippen warned him.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear the testimony
you shall give before the court...
...will be the truth,
so help you God?
I do.
Doctor, on the night
of your nephew's death...
...you attended a dinner party,
didn't you?
I did. You were also present.
Your Honor, if necessary, I will
put myself under oath and testify.
Proceed.
Now, then, on that occasion, you and he
had an argument, didn't you?
- We exchanged a few words.
- They were rather heated words.
He protested that
you were losing confidence in him.
That you found him incompetent.
I never put it that way.
Regardless of how you put it...
...did you see fit at that time to relieve
him of certain family responsibilities?
This is a private matter, sir,
and has nothing to do with the case.
Dr. Stearnes, I realize that there are
certain sensitive areas in any family...
...which might better
be left unexposed.
Nevertheless,
did you find him incompetent...
...and did you relieve him
of certain responsibilities?
- Yes.
- Why?
Well, he had a great many
things on his mind.
He had became
somewhat erratic of late.
Are you implying a mental condition?
Objection. Counsel is again putting
words in the mouth of the witness.
Sustained.
Your Honor, I'll rephrase that question.
Did you, on that evening, tell me
that your nephew had not been well?
I...
I don't remember.
Your Honor, during the recess which
followed the cross-examination...
...of Mr. Archibald...
...I telephoned the personal physician
of Morton Stearnes.
Unfortunately, he was not in town...
...but his associate suggested
I call the University Hospital.
Those records there show that
for six weeks preceding his death...
...Morton Stearnes was being examined
for a brain tumor...
...and was suffering constant pain.
Did you have knowledge of this?
Yes.
Why didn't you
come forward with this?
Information that could've been
so vital in the defense.
Why, it did not seem material
to me at the time.
Doctor, I can think
of many things...
...which in your judgment
might not seem to be material.
Would you like me
to pursue them also?
Mr. Lawrence,
it never occurred to me...
...to connect Morton's mental
or physical condition with his death.
Like everyone else,
I assumed that Chet was guilty.
But could you not now assume that
after a humiliating scene with you...
...and dreading the prospect
of brain surgery...
...and finding himself possessing
a weapon...
...that Morton Stearnes
might have taken his own life?
Objection. We're not interested
in any speculation.
We're only interested
in what he actually knows.
The defendant will rise.
Take the verdict.
In this bill of indictment...
...Chester A. Gwynn is charged
with murder in the first degree.
- How do you find?
- We find the defendant not guilty.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.
Chester Gwynn, you are discharged.
Court's adjourned.
I'm so happy for you, Chester.
We won't turn our backs
on you this time, Chet.
Won't you come and stay
with Carlos and me, dear?
I'd love to, Adelaide.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Tony, you were wonderful.
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Come on, Kate.
Congratulations, Tony.
You did all right.
You keep this up and you'll wind up being
more than just a Philadelphia lawyer.
- Thanks, Louis.
- I'll be talking to you, huh?
There's so many things
I wanna say, Tony...
...but I don't know how.
You were...
What you did was tremendous.
No, it wasn't tremendous.
It was necessary.
And I found out something
about myself.
Maybe I...
I'm not as good as
or as much as I hoped I could be...
...but I'm not as bad
as I thought I was.
I wouldn't have you any different.
How'd you like to go
and get a hamburger?
Well, I'm a chili girl my...
I'd like a hamburger.
