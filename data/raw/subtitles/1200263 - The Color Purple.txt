And with all her strength,
the girl returned to work
in the field.
But it was so hot,
she could barely stand.
The overseer yelled at her
till she got to her feet.
Frightened, she turned
to her mama and asked--
Let me say it.
This my favorite part.
Just like Mama used to read it.
The girl was floating
above the ground,
but she wasn't flying yet.
She got nervous that
the overseer would catch her,
and without faith,
she fell to the ground hard.
When can I wear it, Ma?
Not now, baby, but soon.
Soon.
Mm-hmm.
This color's gonna look
like heaven on you.
All right.
Now, give me your hand.
I want you to feel the needle.
Mmm.
Feel it?
I want you to feel the cloth.
Feel it.
Yes, Mama.
All right. I want you to try.
Okay.
Now, don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
Push it through there.
That's good. That's good.
I broke my water.
Hold still.
I'll get the midwife.
You're doing just fine,
Miss Celie.
I just need you
to push one more time.
Almost there.
One more push. Come on.
There.
It's a little boy.
There he is.
Here's Mommy.
Oh.
Adam.
Adam.
You nursed that baby yet?
- I had a boy, Pa.
- Hand him here.
I'll give him to God.
Same as I did the other.
Let me have just one more day
with him.
No.
I can help Celie with the baby.
I'll even help
pull some of her weight
round the house.
No. That baby mine.
I take him if I want to.
Give him here.
You think he killing my babies?
I believe he give 'em to God,
just like he say.
But they mine.
How come God
don't give 'em back?
Afternoon.
More like early evening,
but howdy.
Early evening?
That means
it's getting late, gal.
Let me give you a ride home.

Celie!
Celie!
Where was you?
Sweeping the porch.
Get upstairs.
Morning, Alfonso.
What can I do you for?
I wants to ask
for your Nettie's hand.
Needs me a wife.
You gonna need more than that
from what I hear.
Besides, Nettie too smart.
She gonna be a schoolteacher.
But I'll let you
have Celie, though,
for a cow and a couple of eggs.
She ugly as homemade sin,
but will work hard like a man.
Celie. That's what you call
that thing walked
in your store?
I don't want that.
Then your children
ain't beating on you
bad enough, are they?
But you'll come around.
Hopefully.
'Fore they burn your house down.
And it's only a matter of time
'fore they do.
And then what you gonna do, huh?
How you gon' bring a wife--
Who that outside talking to Pa?
The devil.
He followed me home
from school today,
and now I can't get rid of him.
He sure look nice for a devil.
Devil always look nice
till he start raising hell.
Church ladies say
he got three raggedy children
at home.
Three?
Mm-hmm.
Say his last wife was shot
by some man she was seeing
on the side.
And he ain't grieve none,
'cause he got something
on the side too.
A loose woman named Shug Avery.
What's a loose woman?
A woman who won't let no one man
tie her down, I suppose.
That sounds nice.
I wants to be a loose woman.
No, you don't.
Let me teach you something.
Today, our teacher taught us
about a place called Africa.
She say that's where
our peoples is from.
Ah-free-ka.
She say our mommas
come from queens over there.
You know what that means?
That means that we...
royalty.
Pack your things, Celie.
Time for you to leave.
You marrying Mister.
Who Mister?
The devil.
Mama's sewing kit.
Don't let him
walk all over you, hear?
You keep your head held high.
Just like Mama taught us.
I'll come visit you when I can.
Even if we have to part,
you and me,
us have one heart.
Us have one heart.
Hey.
You think this is bad,
wait till you get upstairs.
Y'all come down here
and greet your new mama!
Hey, come on now. Come on.
You could, um...
get to cleaning,
and then fix supper.
Mercy to glory, Miss Celie.
This food so good,
it got my eyes watering.
- I gots to have seconds.
- Harpo!
You done already had seconds.
Well, thirds then.
When you gonna give
these children a bath?
It'll have to wait till morn--
Nettie!
Pa tried to touch me.
I can't live there no more.
Come on.
Where she gonna sleep?
I won't be no trouble, Mister.
I goes to school during the day,
and at nights I study.
You gonna have to
pull your weight
around the house.
And whatever I say go.
Yes, sir.
Fair enough, then.
I'm going to town.
Gather me some firewood
'fore I get back.
Yes'em.
- Nettie!
- What?
Where we going?
We gots to get firewood
'fore Mister come home.
We will. But first,
we gots to have us some fun.
But, Nettie!
Come on!
We'll only be gone a spell!

Get!
Nettie! Write me!
I'll write you every day.
Nothing but death
can keep me from it.
Get off my land!

That mailbox is mine's.
When you gonna start
listening to me?
You chirp more than the birds.
Sofia, I mean it.
Don't you go no further.
That's where I'm going.
I'ma put my foot down!
What that foot
supposed to do, Harpo?
I bet it won't walk over me.
Howdy, ma'am. Is Mister around?
Oh, come on.
Nah, he at the ale house.
Ale house.
No, no. He ain't there. Sofia!
Give me ten
like you drinking gin.
When your daddy go out,
guess who go in.
You got it, baby.
Dirty 30! Really.
-Put it down.
-I'm gonna put it down.
- You can't go in there.
- I'm going in.
No, you-- You ain't supposed
to be in here, girl.
Stop.
What's wrong with you, gal?
Can't you read?
"No fighting, no killing,
no women."
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, I read what pleases me.
All right. Now, come on.
You gonna have to
get her out of--
Howdy, sir. High time me
and you was introduced.
Tell him who I is,
Harpo.
Uh, well, uh,
Pa, Grampy, gents.
I wants to introduce y'all
to my girl.
This here's Sofia.
Mmm. That's a lot of woman.
Whose kin are you, gal?
You seem like trouble.
Oh, no, sir. I'm one
of Argus Butler's daughters.
No trouble at all. Just big.
Who the daddy?
Harpo.
How we know that?
Harpo know. That's what matters.
See, me and him,
we more than a whimsy.
We's in love.
Okay, now.
Come on, Sofia. Stop it.
This is better
than a radio show, man.
This good as hell. Come on.
I ain't gonna let you
marry my son
'cause you in the family way.
Pretty gal like you
can take his mind,
but you can't have his money.
He ain't got no money.
See, my sister and her husband
say I can live with them
as long as I please.
Now, I come here out of respect.
But if there ain't none to get,
there sure ain't none to give.
Sofia--
Harpo!
Let's get on up and away
from here.
I'm coming, sugar dumpling.
Boy!
Don't you move a muscle.
Fine. Stay then, Harpo.
But when you gets cold at night,
you know good and well
who heats up your bones.
Don't keep me waiting.
That gal ain't welcome
in my house.
Pa, she carrying my child.
Tough.
She ain't worthy of ya.
What is that?
What in tarnation...
Harpo!
Harpo!
Oh!
You get my permission
to build down here?
What?
You get my permission
to build down here?
Oh, you know Grampy gave me
this land when I turned 16.
I'm building me and Sofia
a home on it.
Boy, you carrying your brains
in your back pocket?
You can't build no house
on no swampland.
If you were smart,
you'd use it to plant rice.
Well, maybe I ain't smart.
That's the wisest thing
you done ever said.
Maybe I gots a dumb heart
'cause I's in love.
You ain't in love.
You just in way over your head.
All the learnin' I put
inside you, you still don't know
how to be a man.
I'm building my woman
a house, Pa.
Now, you can stay and help
if you want.
And if not, well,
this conversation
finna be shorter
than the time it took you
to walk down here.
- Is that so?

Then why'd you fix your mouth

I say it 'cause

Whoo!
Hello! I'm out of giggle water!
Oh.

Well, don't just stare at it.

Oh, you got good hands.
Ooh, you scratched a song
right outta my head.
How long you and Albert
been a thing?
Albert?
Your husband.
You tryin' to tell me
you don't know
your own husband's name?
I thought his name was Mister.
Mister ain't no name.
It's a title.
Just another way of saying
"master," if you ask me.
That man can't even stand up
to his own daddy,
but got everybody
calling him "Mister"
like he the only one in town.
Let him tell it,
he'll try to convince you he is.
That man get to
high-stepping--
How come you don't laugh none?
You know,
if you ain't gon' laugh,
you need to sell
your funny bone.
Ooh!
Smile. It's healthy.
Ain't you got something
to make you hop out of bed
every morning
and just smile?
Ain't you got children?
I had two.
And I'm not sure if they alive
or where they are.
Hmm.
Well...
when you think about 'em,
does your heart get full
like the first time
you held 'em?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, then they still alive.
That's nature's way
of telephoning. Mm-hmm.
That's how I know my pa
still in this world.
When I get to
thinking about him,
and how he used to sing to me--
How come you just don't go
and visit him?
He live just yonder
by the church.
He don't wanna see me.
He ain't forgave me
for choosing the blues
over his religion.
Funny thing is,
God ain't never left me.
I figure,
if God understands why
I sings the blues,
then maybe one day my pa will.
Come.
Let's see this smile in color.
Ooh, sweet
and lovin' God.
Now we're talking.
Albert ain't gon' be able
to keep his hands off you.
Maybe we should try
another color.
Oh, my--
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Oh.
Whoo!
Ooh! Oh!
Heard you brought
your ho back here
and brought the plagues.
Don't start
that foolishness, Pa.
You want a glass of water,
Ol' Mister?
I don't mind.
When I look over this land,
I think about my daddy
who slaved it.
To think of bringing a ho
to this place where
your ancestors died and bled...
Must be ashamed of yourself.
Daddy, Shug ain't no ho.
She got a wild heart like me.
You ain't got
the head to understand
I never stopped loving her.
The woman's cursed.
You ain't seen those robins
covering the sky last week?
Heard that's when she arrived.
Not to mention
the swarms of 'squitoes
and this here heat wave.
Here you are.
I sweetened it for ya.
Thank you. You have
my sympathies here, girl.
You one of the few women
in this town
that allow your husband's ho
to sleep in your bed,
spreading legs...
Daddy, it's time to go.
You ain't even gon' let me
finish my water first?
Ah.
- Daddy, go on.
- Oh, shut up.
Come on. Come on.
How do you know
which one is ripe?
I don't know nothin'
about picking no peas.
You got to feel 'em.
If they rough around the edges,
they probably soft
on the inside.
Whew, would you look at all
of God's beautiful creation.
You know,
God loves admiration. Mmm.
You saying God is vain.
No. Not vain, Miss Celie.
God just wants
to share a good thing.
You see,
I think it pisses God off
if you walk past
the color purple
and not notice it.
You saying God wants to be loved
like it say in the Bible?
Oh, everything and everybody
wants to be loved.
Especially God.
That's why God be in everything.
And see, when you love
what God has made,
you is loving God
and God is loving you.
You see, God is in music
and the water,
in the sunlight.
God be...
he be as big as the sun,
yet small enough to fit
in all our hearts.
I been wondering...
if God love me,
then why he take my babies?
And why he take my Nettie?
Sound like men did that.
Not God.
Harpo!
Miss Shug! Celie!
Look at you.
Oh, my goodness.
Harpo.
Uh-huh?
It sure is nice to see you
not just following
your pa's footsteps,
but building something
of your own.
Thank you, Miss Shug. Thank you.

And...
well, me and the boys,

You ain't gots to go nowhere.
She walked away,

- All right.
- Like I said, fine with me.
Don't touch me,

Morning.
Uh, Albert around?
Oh, no. He probably

I'll take the mail.
Take care now.
"Nettie"?
Mercy to glory!
Celie! Celie!
Celie, get up!
You got a letter.
Get up!
It's from her.
Her?
Your Nettie!
Come on.
"Dear Celie,
I hope this reaches you,
as I've been writing you
every week f-- for years.
I suppose you didn't get
any of my letters because--
because you ha--
haven't written back."
Nettie alive.
Yes.
"You probably
won't get this either,
because Mister is still probably
the only one who takes mail
from the box."
"But if you do get this,
I want you to know,
I love you, and I'm not dead."
There's got to be more of 'em
somewhere around here. Come on.
Pa.
Hey, Pa. Come on, now.
-Pa, get up! Come on, now.
-Oh! Oh, shit. Oh.
Come on. Come on.
Well, hey.
Hey.
Hey, why you gotta
wake me dr-- Oh!
Ooh! You almost stepped
on my toe! Come on!
Well, hey, hey, you know,
Shug leave for Memphis today.
Come on.
We gotta hurry up.
No. Steps! Come on.
Oh, shit.
Hold this.
Nettie.
All of 'em.
Pa!
-He'll be back any minute now.
-Yeah. Take all of 'em. Go.
Push da button!
Where Shug at?
Hey, Shug!
You still leaving today?
Take all the time you need.
I'll have Albert help me pack.
- You up there?
- I'm coming!
Nettie.
Down the street?
Where?
Stay a bit longer.
For what? It's okay.
Stay a little longer.
I'll be back.
Oh.
Hey. Take me with you.
Next time.
I'll be back before
you can spell Mississippi.
Come on, fellas.
Dear Celie, when Mister
forced me off his land,
I got a job working for a pastor
across town.
I help take care of their babies
for food and shelter.
They told me they were going
to Africa as missionaries.
While we were on a great boat
to Africa,
the reverend told me
he and his wife
couldn't bear chil'ren.
But God sent them two.
They showed me the name
you had sewn
on the baby's blanket,
and I knew
the babies were yours.
It's a miracle!
Adam and Olivia are right here
with me.
My babies.
They alive.
And they with Nettie.
It was like
Black seeing Black
for the first time.
Celie, we are more than
just kings and queens.
We're at the center
of the universe.
Dear Celie,
I hope this letter
finds you well.
Life has become dire for us.
Our village was bombed
in order to make way
for a road to grow cocoa trees.
The British
colonial administrators
ignored our pleas
to let us keep our land.
We couldn't fight 'em,
so now we walk to a refugee camp
across the border.
I have faith that God
will let us see each other
before we die.
I only hope when that day comes,
we are not too old
to recognize each other.
Celie!
Why supper late?
Because I--
I lost track of time--
I works the land
from sunup to sundown,
breaking my back.
All you gots to do
is cook and clean,
and you can't even do that.
I-- I'll do better.
That's what ya mouth say.
Clean it up!
If I gots to eat late,
you won't eat at all.
There we go.
Y'all, scoot on real good.
Make sure there some room.
Miss Celie! Hop on in.
We going into town!
I can't.
I got work round the house.
Work can wait.
Come on, girl.
I ain't seen you
since Jesus wept. Come on in.
- Come on, now.
- My treat.
Get in here!
Oh, girl, these kids
ain't driving you crazy,
are they?
- No, I like your kids.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I don't know, sister.
- Oh!
Yeah, sure.
Y'all want some ice cream?
- Ice cream!
- Let's go get some ice cream.
-Y'all been so good today.
-I want an ice cream.
Now hold on, lil' junior.
Let me get you now.
There you go.
Now don't be asking this man
all these questions.
He only got vanilla.
He ain't got no chocolate, okay?
-How you doing, sir?
-Hey, folks.
-Uh, can I have
two vanilla ice creams?
-Sure thing.
- Are those yours?
- Mm-hmm.
They so chocolate
I could just eat 'em up.
And so well-behaved and clean.
You should come be my maid.
No, thank you.
You sure?
That's a lot of mouths to feed.
I'm Miss Millie,
the mayor's wife.
I'm sure you've heard of me.
If not, just ask around.
The colored love me.
I'll pay you fair.
Honey.
-Just get in the car.
-Yeah, go on back
to the car now.
Hey! I'm talking to you, gal.
You wants to be my maid or not?
Hell no.
What's that you said to my wife?
I said hell no.
- Mama!
- Come on, Sofia.
Just get in the car!
Buster, get my children
out of here!
Don't you touch me!
Don't touch me!
Get my children out of here!
Buster, get my children
out of here!
Shut her up!
Get away!
- Don't touch me!
- No!
-Buster.
-Don't let 'em see.
- Stop it!
- Gotta know your place, girl.
Hey, Sofia.
Hey, Sofia.
How you been?
Sorry I's late.
But you know
I won't miss our visits
come hell or heaven take me.
Sheriff say I could bring you
a plate for Thanksgiving.
He say you ain't ate in days.
Harpo and Squeak
keep a close eye
on your children.
And-- And then Buster,
he help out every now and then.
Though I fear
the incident broke him some.
But Harpo love his kids
like they his own.
He make a whole lot of money
down at the juke
since Squeak been singing--
Time to go.
I just got here, sir.
I said time to go.
I'll be back next week.
Now you eat something
for me, hear?
I'ma get you out of here,
God's my witness--
I said time to go!
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me!

I have agreed to allow her
to live and work for me
till she's back on her feet.
Well, come on then.
Sofia.
Let's not dawdle.
Sofia.
I made this for you.
Hmm.
Dear Celie...
...there must be a God,
because I finally
heard from you.
When your letter arrived
in the village,
I stared at it for an hour
before I could open it.
My hands trembled so.
I cried enough to make--
Celie!
I thought I told you
not to touch the mail.
Shug's coming shortly.
Come shave me.
Celie!
Get the molasses out your ass!
Keep your hands steady.
Yoo-hoo! I's home.
Come on.
Introduce you to my folks.
The minute after
me and Grady got married,
Grady said,
"Honey, what you want
for your honeymoon?"
I say, "Two things."
"I wants a new car and a drive
to see my two favorite peoples
for Easter."
Yeah, Shug talk
about y'all so much,
I feel like we already kin.
Miss Celie.
We's married ladies now.
- Come on. What you got to eat?
- All right.
Nice to meet you.
Mighty fine supper, Miss Celie.
I'm full as a tick
on a big ol' dog.
That's it. Yeah.
Well, Sofia, I think we, uh--
We all glad you finally home.
Yeah. Welcome home, Sofia.
You sure you don't want
nothing to eat?
Okay.
Well, the time has come
for me to tell y'all,
me and Grady can't stay.
Mmm, yeah, we gotta
get on the road 'fore dusk.
Y'all just got here.
I know, but, uh,
Grady gotta get back
to work tomorrow.
Mm-hmm.
Also...
we taking Celie with us.
Ain't that right, Cel?
Come again?
Celie is coming to Memphis
with us.
It's time she saw more
of this world.
-I'd die
before I let that happen.
-Good.
That's just
the going away present
I been needing.
-Hey! Watch yourself!
-You better handle your woman.
She done found her mouth.
She's just being stupid.
-What's gotten into you, dummy?
-I done had enough of you.
That's what's gotten into me.
It's time I be free from you
and enter to creation.
You ain't gon' be talking
to my boy that way.
Not in my house.
Maybe if he hadn't been
your boy, he might at least be
an inch of a man.
-Watch your mouth!
-You took my sister Nettie
away from me.
And you hid her letters
all these years,
and you knew
she was the only person love me.
But Nettie alive.
What?
She is.
And my chil'ren
with Nettie in Africa.
And when they get home,
us all together,
we gon' whup your country ass!
Watch your mouth in my house!
It's about time
to load the luggage.
No, no.
Come on, Miss Celie,
why don't you go and have
some peas and be civil now?
Harpo, your daddy made my life
hell on earth.
He ain't nothing
but a sack of dead horse shit.
And horse shit belong
in the ground.
She called him
a sack of dead horse shit.
Now if that ain't worth
the joy of laughter,
I don't know what is.
Harpo, pass me them peas.
I wanna thank you, Miss Celie...
for everything
you've done for me.
I was feeling mighty bad,
rotting in that prison cell.
But you came and seen about me
every week
without fail.
That's how I knows
there's a God.
'Cause he's living in you.
The women at this table
have lost their minds.
Shut up, you old toothless goat!
You leave me,
you're not gettin' a thin dime.
Not a red cent.
- Come on! Come on!
- Celie, no!
- No, no!
- It ain't worth it, Miss Celie!
Did I ever ask you
for anything?
Not even your old sorry hand
in marriage!
Come on, Celie. Let's go!
Let's go!
Sofia can take care of this.
Oh, yeah.
Sofia born to take care of this.
Y'all go on!
It's always something.
Now where you going?
I wants to go to Memphis too.
And do what?
-Oh, come on now. Squeak!
-My name ain't Squeak.
It's Mary Agnes.
Come on now. Come on, Squeak.
Old Sofia home now!
There's gon' be
some changes made!
She'll be back, Pa.
She'll be back.
You'll be back!
Where you gon' go?
Shug got talent.
And looks.
All you fit to do
is clean her slop jar
and cook her food.
And you ain't even
that good a cook!
Until you do right by me,
everything you think about
gon' crumble.
You Black,
you poor,
you ugly,
you a woman.
I should've kept you
under my shoe
like the roach you is.
Everything done to me,
already done to you.
I may be Black,
I may be poor,
I may even be ugly,
but I'm here!
I'm here!
You'll be back!
Whoo!
We made it.
We are here.
All right.
Home sweet home.
Yes.
Mmm.
Come on. Let me show you around.
Go on and make yourself at home,
Mary Agnes.
All right, let me take you
up to your room.
I ain't never had
my own room before.
I probably wouldn't even know
how to act.
Please!
Just act natural. Come on.
Come on!
- Boss!
- Yeah?
You might wanna
come take a look.
What's going on? I'll be there.
What's going on?
Beetles!
Huh?
I think we gon' have to
burn these again, boss.
It's like this here land cursed.
- Shug?
- Come on.
- One more.
- Oh, what?
Almost there.
What?
Surprise!
Happy birthday, Miss Celie!
Aw!
Here, let me take that.
Here. It's that little something

Hello.
Who?
Miss Celie.
You got a call.
Who is it?
Don't know
but sounds urgent.
Evening. This is Celie.
Sweet, loving God,
we thank you for the life
of Mr. Alfonso Harris.
And we thank you
for his daughter Celie,
who we welcome back home.
And likewise,
we thanks you for his wife,
dear sister Mary Ellen,
who we are praying for
in her hour of bereavement.
Mr. Alfonso was a man.
A hardworking man.
Now, sure, he was difficult
and, uh, stubborn.
Now you're preaching.
And I'd be a liar
if I told you for certain
that Mr. Alfonso made it
to the pearly gates.
Mm-hmm.
What I do know is
we must forgive,
and ask forgiveness from others,
or God will be hard-pressed
to show his mercy toward us.
So don't tarry, church.
For no one knows
what day, what hour,
we will see our Father again.
Amen?
- Amen.
- Amen.
Ezekiel, if you will.
- God bless you.
- Good to see you.
God bless you.
Bless you.
Really enjoyed your sermon, Pa.
Especially what you--
what you said
about forgiveness and--
Ain't the time right now.
Reverend's busy.
God bless you, baby.
God bless you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Meet me at the store.
I got something to tell you.
What's this for?
The place is yours.
He didn't leave it to you?
No, ma'am.
It wasn't his to give.
You didn't know?
We wasn't quite
on speaking terms.
Well, when I went
to settle Alfonso's will,
I found out from the lawyer
that this wasn't his land
nor his store.
Your real pa built this place.
Alfonso...
was my pa.
No, ma'am.
When your daddy died,
your ma married Alfonso.
After she died,
Alfonso took over the store.
Your real daddy even put you
and your sister's name
on the deed.
That's how I know
this here land belongs to y'all.
I had a ma...
and a pa that loved me.
Dear God...
I hope this place brings you
and your sister comfort.

Thank you.
Where you going?
- Hey, hey. Don't mind if I do.
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Sorry about that.
That's okay. I know.
Hey, hey, hey!
You need to do something
about your pa.
He been in here every night
this week causing a ruckus.
I know.
I'll take care of it. Hold on.
All right.
Oh, come on. I'll count you in.
- No, no, no.
- And five...
No, no, no.
That's not happening tonight.
Hey, hey, Son. How you doing?
-Not this time.
-We about to play a little set.
-You're fitting
to embarrass yourself.
-I'll count you-- Hey! Oh!
You all right?
Ah, it's all right.
They don't know about
no good music no how.
Get off the stage.
I used to break hearts
back in my day.
Women used to toss off
their drawers.
Hey, hey! Come on.
Tell 'em, boy.
Tell 'em who I was.
Yeah.
Could've been in Shug's band
if I wanted to.
If I didn't
have to farm...
I'm so sorry.
...my grandaddy's land--
Oh!
All right. Sofi--
Come on.
- Come on.
Come on. Get up.
- All right. All right.
Get off.
Come on. It's time to go home.
I had my doubts...
about you building that juke.
But you done good, boy.
You done good.
Pop, you, um--
You all right?
'Course.
Yeah?
Why you got your arm around me
like I'm old?
Pop.
I can get home by myself.
Until you do right by me,
everything you think about
gon' crumble.
I'll do right.
Dear God, I'll do right.
I'll do right.
I'll do right.
Hey. Hey.
You all right, Albert?
Albert, you all right?
I'm fine.
Uh, yeah. Yes, sir.
Uh, I fell asleep
looking at the stars is all.
You take care of yourself.
Go on.
Dear Celie,
the letters you've sent
fill my days with joy.
I know it must've been hard
finding me.
We've had to relocate
several times over the years.
The British
have seized the east.
We lost our passports
and documentation
when our village was burned.
I've decided it's best
that me and your children
make our way back home to you.
Celie,
we need your help
getting back to the States.
As soon as you get this,
please go
to the immigration office
to prove our citizenship.
You're our only hope.
Mr. Johnson?
Even if we could find them,
which I doubt,
it'll cost you hundreds
to get 'em here from Africa.
Well, uh...
-I thanks ya.
-Mm-hmm.
Say, uh...
I gots me some land.
I could sell some of it
and get the money.
Think that'll help?
Well,
that would definitely help.
My secretary
can start the paperwork.
We're closed.
Evening.
Hate to bother you.
This gon' sound odd, but, um...
I came to buy some pants.
I can come back later
if it's too much trouble.
I also brought you this.
Hmm.
Oh.
See something you like?
Oh, uh...
Why don't I just take
one of the ones that
no one else buys?
Help your business out some.
You...
You looking nice.
You sure you wanna be seen
in these?
I don't mind.
Give folks
something to laugh at.
I best be locking up.
It's getting late.
That it is.
Thank you.
Say, uh...
maybe someday, uh,
you and me, we could, uh--
I don't know, if, uh--
if you feel like it sometime...
Let's just us be friends.
Oh.
Yeah.
Hmm.
