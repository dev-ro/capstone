Bye.
Three months' work
down the fucking drain.
I scoped out his home
and his office for days.
I checked everything.
Not everything, apparentIy!
He had zero security!
He was there for the taking!
Maybe he saw something.
What do you mean?
Take it easy, Frans.
He didn't see anything!
Maybe he reaIized
he was being watched
and brought in some security.
What do you want?
- Fuck off!
- I work here, remember?
Get Iost.
We're busy here.
Boo!
Cut it out, Frans.
He's aII right.
Shat your pants?
Time to go, guys.
""Arno Keizer Europe"s Biggest
Timber Importer""
""Arno Keizer PIeased
With YearIy Figures""
I toId you it wouIdn't work.
Not enough oxygen.
It was sired by
a German champion.
Shit!
Why did you have to Ieave it in
for 24 hours?
''THE HEINEKEN KIDNAPPING''
Stop.
Now what?
Check your mirror.
I know the road is cIear.
Check it.
- Don't forget the theory test.
- Sure.
What's up?
He's short of breath.
Get this,
wiII you, honey?
''Pharmacy''
Fuck, man!
You asshoIe!
Are you bIind?
Dickhead.
- Ab?
- Yes?
- Can we move on?
- Coming, sir.
There you go.
What about my moped?
I'm caIIing the poIice.
- You jumped the Iights.
- I did?
You just wait here
for the poIice.
I'm afraid I can't.
Is that so?
WiII 1 00 guiIders
cover it?
How shouId I know?
Do I Iook Iike
a bike mechanic?
He'II die if he carries on
smoking and drinking.
So are we going in the morning
or in the afternoon?
Going where?
To London.
This Saturday.
I'm not going.
There's stiII a price tag
on your back.
New suit?
Quite a bargain.
Sir.
Can you spare me a guiIder?
So I can get on a tram.
He Ieaves his office at aImost
exactIy the same time
every night.
The driver is carrying
two cases,
so he can't do a thing.
It's dead easy.
Here.
The route through the
bicycIe underpass is perfect.
You Ieave a car there,
and it's bIocked.
And in a month's time,
it wiII be pitch-dark there.
He has no security,
and he's Ioaded with money.
He's perfect.
Much better than
this Arno Keizer.
What do you know
about that?
I heard you guys taIking.
I want to be invoIved.
SeriousIy invoIved.
I don't know, Rem.
I don't think you know
what you're getting into.
You don't?
You think I don't know
where you get your money from?
Your average
buiIding contractor
doesn't drive
a Mercedes 500SL CabrioIet.
You wanted to kidnap him
and put him in this tank.
Right?
Run the tape again.
What if a truck
starts unIoading?
Then you're stuck.
You can go round
the other side if need be.
Against the traffic?
Across the pavement.
You can aIways get away.
He's got the money.
That's for sure.
So I'd say as Iong as he hasn't
got any bodyguards yet.
What about him?
Yeah.
He wiII have to be guarded
round the cIock.
We'II have to get food,
coIIect the ransom.
And our Iives have to carry on
as normaI to the outside worId,
so there's enough to do.
I don't want him, Cor.
He's too young.
He happens to be famiIy.
I can vouch for him.
He's young.
He's eager.
He'II come in handy.
He'II be our downfaII,
I teII you.
AII right.
But we'II make it 1 00 miIIion.
That's far too much.
Why?
The sheer weight of it.
Here's our new guard dog.
- A reaI Iooker.
- Nice mutt.
AII right, guys.
Start searching.
SureIy not in the cIoset?
Did you hide
some Easter eggs too, Jan?
Oh.
Oh!
What have we got here?
Got something, Frans?
ExceIIent.
Great stuff!
Very nice.
My compIiments!
Look at this.
Nice and big.
We can make two ceIIs
in here.
Why don't we
take the driver too?
Then he can't taIk
to the poIice.
Yeah, why not take
whoever's around?
- I think-
- You shut up.
You just do
what we teII you.
Frans.
If you take the driver too,
you'II have, Iike,
some change...
in case they make troubIe.
That's what I said.
You think about it, Cor.
Dad.
Dad.
Come.
Rem, I need a drink.
No, you can't.
Yes, I need one.
Look at this.
I know.
Come.
I'II take you upstairs.
Back it up.
A bit more.
Stop. Stop.
Shit.
Now what?
We're going ahead.
Fuck.
HaiI Mary, fuII of grace,
our Lord is with thee.
BIessed art thou among women
and bIessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
HoIy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
- Shit.
- What?
It's the driver.
Frank Sinatra's
manager caIIed.
He thinks this song
has potentiaI.
ReaIIy?
Wow.
CongratuIations.
He's coming down.
Shit.
We're not going to make it.
We'II have to puII out.
Wait.
I forgot something.
Door's opening.
Shit.
Stop. Stop.
What?
It's not him.
Yeah.
There he is.
What's going on here?
What the heII?
Schweigen!
Damn it!
Achtung!
Damn.
A taxi.
Anziehen.
SchneII!
Hi, guys.
- Thomas, how's it going?
- Fine.
Been to the races IateIy?
I'm going on Sunday,
I think.
- Want to come?
- Sure.
Can you turn it up?
Tonight in Amsterdam,
beer brewer Heineken
and his driver
were bundIed into a car and
kidnapped by armed assaiIants.
The men,
thought to number three,
dragged Mr. Heineken
and his driver into a van
and drove off.
Fuck!
Can you beIieve that,
Thomas?
It's pretty stiff.
We'II have three beers
and a 7UP.
What time are we Ieaving
on Sunday?
EarIy.
We have to be back in time
to feed Heineken
and his driver.
I Iike it.
Did you sIeep in tiII now?
Next week, right?
What?
Your driving test.
Your mum and I
have discussed it.
We're getting a tax refund.
If you pass your driving test,
we'II give you 700 guiIders.
Towards buying a car.
You don't have to.
I don't need it.
Have you heard?
- Heard what?
- About Heineken.
He's been kidnapped.
You're kidding.
Turn the thing on.
See what they say.
Is as yet unknown.
This is the entrance
to the buiIding
Mr. Heineken Ieft
at around 7.:00 P.M.
Together with his driver...
Did they take him too?
ApparentIy.
The men,
thought to number three,
bundIed him into a van
and drove off.
Look what Mum bought me
for my birthday.
Wait a minute.
Heineken has been kidnapped.
What?
Heineken has been kidnapped.
A demand has been made.
That"s aII I can teII you.
Do you have any idea
who these kidnappers might be?
In the interest of
Mr. Heineken and Mr. Doderer-
Hi, sis.
Happy birthday.
Thanks, kid.
It's beautifuI.
- Is it reaI?
- No.
Yes, it is.
TaIk about spoiIing.
Let's go to the kitchen.
Hi, Frans.
Many happy returns.
Did it go weII?
Fed them
and put them to bed earIy.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Many happy returns.
WeIcome.
Give us a hand.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Can I teII you
that Frans is not your type?
He isn't?
- And you are, I suppose?
- Yes.
You're the most beautifuI woman
I've ever seen.
AII right.
Want to go out for a night?
Why shouId I?
I'II teII you why.
I saw you come in,
and you know what?
I saw that you weren't happy.
You need something.
Let's caII it a friend.
And you're going to be
my friend?
That's right.
Don't, you nutcase.
So we'II go out?
Wait.
How do I find you?
I guess you'II have to Iook.
Was haben Sie mit meinem
Chauffeur gemacht?
Lebt er noch?
Enjoy your workday.
Are those frames ready yet?
NearIy.
What does he say?
''I'd Iike an extra bIanket,
cIean, pIease,
''a dressing gown, shaving
things, a comb, sIippers,
''a simpIe cIock, a desk,
a proper chair.
P.S.: Do something
about the music.''
SpeIIing mistake, Cor?
HeIIo?
Hi, honey.
Bye, honey.
Bye.
Take it easy, wiII you?
Lisa.
Found you.
I want to see you.
You can't.
Frans is on his way.
Tomorrow night?
I'II pick you up at 8:00.
No.
What do you mean, no?
No.
I can't make that either.
I'm working tiII
haIf past 8:00.
I'II meet you outside
the KrasnapoIsky HoteI.
Was ist Ios?
Kaput?
Broken?
Damn.
530 kiIometers.
You'II be home Iate,
Frans.
Are you out of your mind?
Wow.
Did I hurt you?
Why did you Ieave me
waiting?
Come here.
No.
Come here.
No.
You come here.
We can't.
Frans has a key.
Ask him to return it.
He owns this pIace.
Then break up with him.
It's not that easy to break up
with a guy Iike Frans.
Are you scared of him?
Yes.
Aren't you?
No.
Frans wiII be gone aII night.
How do you know?
I know.
BeIieve me.
Your turn.
Fuck! Fuck!
Shit!
Fuck!
- Boo!
- Ah...
They didn't show up
with the ransom?
What the heII
were they thinking?
I'II kick them aII out.
As Iong as I'm aIive,
I'm in charge.
Van Schaik.
Get in touch with him.
They wiII pay.
And?
Van Schaik.
Address and phone number.
Yes...
Rem, it's your mother.
Yes?
HeIIo?
Oh, shit!
Yes. Yes.
Straight ahead
at the intersection.
What was that for?
The cycIist.
Look, he turned right.
Yes.
You weren't to know that.
He put out his hand.
No, he didn't.
I saw him put out his hand.
Did I faiI my test?
Straight ahead.
Did I faiI my test?
Straight ahead.
You'II find out Iater.
What's he doing?
He's afraid he'II suffocate.
Turn off the music
and give me a hand.
Bitte, nicht festmachen.
Es tut mir weh.
Hor maI.
Did you arrange for us to be
found if something goes wrong?
You're a young guy.
Ich kann aIIes machen.
If you can get me
out of here...
Name your price.
Wie vieI?
Ich mach" dich reich.
MiIIionen, nur fur dich.
What is he doing?
Are you out of your
fucking mind?
He tried to bribe me.
Just two more days!
We're this cIose!
You want to fuck up
the whoIe thing?
Mrs. Humbrechts?
Yes?
Your son's
driving test examiner
has reported him for assauIt.
Is he in?
No.
Can we come inside?
Where is your son?
He's at work.
He works for my son-in-Iaw,
who's a contractor.
At this Iate hour?
I think they had to finish
some job.
These fIats used to beIong
to the brewery.
My husband worked there
for 20 years.
Thank you.
My God, what a movie!
Don't.
Cut it out.
Stop it!
Oh, baby,
so much is going to change.
Like what?
I can't teII you,
but it's aII going to change.
Just wait and see.
Got to get some sIeep now,
baby.
Have to get up earIy tomorrow.
Aufhoren!
Hey!
Aufhoren!
Fucking briIIiant!
Guys...
I'm about to become a dad.
Rem.
PIease hurry up!
Don't worry, honey.
Take it easy.
Go and see Frans.
Don't caII him.
Make sure Jan and he
cIear out the shed.
Then hurry to the hospitaI.
Have Frans pick up
part of the cash.
We'II have to scram.
Lisa.
Is Frans there with you?
No.
Honey, I've got to Ieave,
and so does he.
Where to?
I...
I Iove you.
What's going on?
PIease don't go with Frans,
aII right?
I'II caII you
as soon as I can.
What's up?
They're on to us.
How do you know?
It's 1 00%   certain.
Cor wants Jan and you
to cIear out the shed.
We have to scram.
And you're to pick up
part of the cash.
Fuck!
AII right.
AII right.
I'II meet you guys at
the MoteI Vinkeveen at 6:00 P.M.
Got it.
- AII right?
- AII right.
It's to do with this
driving test examiner, right?
What wouId you say
if I'd kiIIed someone?
I haven't kiIIed anyone,
but...
But it's pretty bad.
Heineken.
It was you.
You kidnapped him.
Yes.
For you.
For me?
Yes, I did it for you.
Why?
Why?
Look at you.
Look at the fucking state
you're in.
It's his fauIt, Dad.
He's got nothing
to do with it.
It's my own fauIt.
I'm no good at anything.
Of course he's to bIame.
Damn it!
You know nothing about it.
Don't touch me.
Dad.
Get your hands off me!
Take care of yourseIf.
You'd better go now.
Go, sweetie.
Cor?
Cor?
In here, Rem!
Your mum's on her way,
honey.
She's on her way here.
Stay here!
You make sure aII goes weII.
Cor!
Room 1 6.
We've got to hurry.
Got 'em?
You got your driving Iicense
after aII.
At Iast.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
Let's spIit it up.
You be carefuI, now.
We need a different car.
This one's open.
Your passports, pIease.
Over here.
Thanks.
Drive safeIy.
Mr. Heineken.
It's over.
I'm Kees Sietsma
of the Amsterdam poIice.
So nice of you to drop by.
We've got them!
GentIemen.
I thank you.
Your cIothes.
And I've got something personaI,
from home.
Thank God
there were two of you.
Get two...
And pay for one.
TeII me.
We've arrested one of them.
Jan BoeIIaard
was sitting at home
and is being questioned.
We found part of the ransom
in the boot of his car.
How much?
3 miIIion.
How taII is he?
Around 6 feet,
a IittIe chubby.
One of them was taII.
Had green eyes.
There were probabIy
four of them.
This is Frans Meijer,
a friend of Jan's.
We don't know much about him,
but he's a member
of the Roman CathoIic Church.
Cor van Hout.
He's got racehorses
and some property in Amsterdam.
He's a friend
of the other two,
and he's married
to Rem Humbrechts' sister.
He's the youngest.
AII we know about him
is that he beat up
his driving test examiner.
He's the one.
He's the one.
I want you to find this one
for me.
He tried to break me.
Take it easy
for a coupIe of days, I'd say.
Today-
and Iisten carefuIIy now.
Today we start setting up
a security service.
24-hour surveiIIance,
nonstop, everywhere.
Get the best peopIe.
As many as it takes.
Buy them out,
whatever the price.
And when this has been set up,
Gerard...
I'm going to try
and take it easy.
I understand.
''WeIcome Home, Heineken''
I was on my way to bed,
and I thought...
I'd go and see how you were.
Yes, weII...
LuciIIe?
Yes?
Forgive me
for caIIing this Iate,
but we've recovered
a Iarge part of the ransom.
How much?
21 miIIion guiIders.
You can caII me anytime
with news Iike that.
And we've discovered something
about Rem Humbrechts' father.
Yes?
It turns out he worked for you
for 20 years.
The Iast coupIe of years,
he worked as a saIes rep
untiI he was fired
for aIcohoIism.
He even took your firm to court,
but he Iost the case.
He did?
He cIaimed he had to join
in the drinking
at the pubs he visited
because the firm
expected him to.
''It was an unwritten ruIe,''
he said.
That's nonsense.
Keep me informed.
WeII done.
I'm over the moon
to see you again.
Mr. Heineken.
Did you sIeep weII?
Yes, thank you.
Do we have unwritten ruIes?
What do you mean?
Do our saIes reps have to
join in the drinking at pubs?
Of course not.
A coupIe of years ago,
someone took us to court,
a man caIIed Humbrechts.
Can you Iook into that?
Mrs. Humbrechts.
Hi, Mum.
How are you?
Mum.
Mum, don't cry.
I'm fine.
How"s Dad?
You have to hide, honey.
They're after you.
HeIIo?
Who is this?
Is that you, Rem?
Who is this?
It's Piet.
A good friend of your dad's.
Piet?
You'd better come home.
Hang up the phone, honey!
Hang up!
Piet?
You"d better come home.
Hang up the phone, honey!
Hang up!
The caII came yesterday
around 1 0:00 p.m.,
from Paris,
the ninth district.
Our French coIIeagues
have been informed.
We'II find them.
And one more thing.
We've arrested a girI at one of
Frans Meijer's premises.
She's here at the station.
She may be invoIved,
but she won't taIk.
Do you know who I am?
And what they've done to me?
They Iocked me up
for three weeks
in a kind of rabbit hutch...
Without any heating.
I had to reIieve myseIf
on a dirty IittIe camping toiIet
and paid 35 miIIion
for the experience.
Do you know Frans Meijer?
Yes.
What did he do?
He kidnapped you.
How Iong have you known this?
Since yesterday.
He came by and...
He wanted me to go with him.
Go where?
I don't know.
Far away, he said.
He reaIIy Iaid into you.
Do you know Jan BoeIIaard?
Cor van Hout?
I once went to Cor's pIace
for a birthday party,
together with Frans.
Rem Humbrechts?
Do you know him?
SureIy Rem is not invoIved?
He's very much invoIved,
we think.
Do you know where he is?
You reaIIy don't know?
No.
I swear.
She's in Iove.
HoId this.
What's wrong?
I'm suffocating.
I'm...
It's okay.
Everything wiII be aII right.
I thought I was dying.
It's okay.
Car 31 1 .
We've got a code 27.
We're standing by.
Lisa.
Hi, honey.
It's me.
Rem.
Where are you?
Never mind.
How are you?
Frans was here.
I know what you guys did.
I'm sorry, Lisa.
I couIdn't teII you.
He went crazy.
He...
He what?
What did he do?
Don't cry, baby.
Baby, baby, don't cry.
But I don't...
Don't cry.
I don't know
what to do anymore.
I thought you were different.
I thought we were...
I thought we...
Yes, darIing, we are.
It's stiII possibIe.
I Iove you, baby.
What good is that to me?
We have a definite Iocation.
Baby, it wiII be aII right,
beIieve me.
I'II caII you again reaI soon.
Don't bother.
- I can't deaI with this.
- Lisa.
Lisa?
Lisa?
Yes?
Mr. Heineken,
Sietsma caIIing.
Sorry to be ringing this Iate,
but we've got them.
What are you taIking about?
Come on!
Come on,
you fucking asshoIes!
Okay, okay, okay, okay...
Mr. Heineken?
They've got them.
That's incredibIe.
When wiII they be here?
In a few days' time,
a week at most.
And we've found
more ransom money,
400,000 guiIders,
in their apartment.
Nice work.
Thanks.
My pIeasure.
CongratuIations.
Thanks for
what you did earIier.
They're three friends
who Iike having fun,
and they're mad
about footbaII.
But the campaign
is about friendship.
I'II think about it.
Thank you.
We've got some
aIternative ideas.
Here's the Humbrechts fiIe.
CongratuIations.
I guess the poIice
are not entireIy useIess.
It did take them three weeks.
Mrs. Van Ditshuyzen.
Gerard.
Great news,
about their capture.
You must be reaIIy happy.
Just one more to go.
EIs.
Yes?
I've done some thinking.
And I've decided...
That you and me...
can't go on together.
It's ruining your future.
I just can't go on.
You want to caII it quits?
I do.
You're upset.
It's better this way.
ReaIIy.
He was arrested two hours ago
on the beach at Den HeIder.
How much?
3 miIIion?
Have mercy upon me, God,
in Your grace.
CIeanse me of my impurities.
Wash away my sins.
Punish me!
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
I know that
I'm an insufferabIe man.
It's what I've become.
I'm not sure why.
But it's not me.
Not reaIIy.
And I don't know
how I can change it.
But I...
I'm scared.
ReaIIy scared.
I don't want to Iose you.
The judges.
This court of Iaw
considers it proven
that the defendants
BoeIIaard and Meijer
unIawfuIIy detained Mr. Heineken
and Mr. Doderer for three weeks
with the aim
of receiving ransom money.
The court considers a Iengthy
prison sentence is in order
for Mr. BoeIIaard
and sentences the defendant
to 1 2 years in prison
Iess the period spent
in pretriaI detention.
The defendant can Iodge
an appeaI within two weeks.
Mr. Meijer wiII be taken
to a forensic cIinic
for further
psychiatric examination.
He wiII be remanded in custody
untiI then.
This concIudes
the court's session.
This treaty
is more than 90 years oId.
We shouId not onIy
Iook at the Ietter,
but above aII
at the spirit of the Iaw.
It may be obvious that in
serious crimes such as these,
extradition is caIIed for.
I see no impediment.
It's the one on the right.
He seems totaIIy unmoved.
The extradition treaty
Ieaves nothing
to be cIarified.
It does not provide
for cases of abduction.
Based on this treaty,
my cIients cannot be extradited
to the NetherIands.
The French Foreign Minister
wants to hoId taIks
at the ministry.
It seems highIy unIikeIy to me
that they wiII be extradited.
Mr. Moszkowicz.
I respect your profession,
but uItimateIy,
and with aII your taIents,
you are nothing more than
these criminaIs' errand boy.
I hear your words,
Mr. Heineken.
Mr. Van der Vijver,
there's a caII for you.
Two years.
Frans Meijer has escaped.
- What?
- He's disappeared.
God damn it!
I want to know everything,
their every move,
who they're phoning,
when they're going
to the toiIet.
They mustn't have
a moment's peace,
never again.
Any news on Frans Meijer?
No.
I want a headIine
in De TeIegraaf.
See to it.
Can I ask a question?
When France
has signed this treaty
and we fiIe another
extradition request,
can they then be extradited?
I thought no case
couId be tried twice
after the appeaI procedure
has been exhausted.
Or am I wrong?
Where's Dad?
He's been poorIy.
HeIIo, sweetheart.
Look what the Dutch papers
are writing.
Rem, have a Iook at this.
""Heineken Hunts Own Kidnappers""
Look, Daddy's in the paper.
Good afternoon.
Thanks for coming.
AII right.
Yes, madam, you can start.
When did you hear
you were going to be reIeased?
''ReIeased'' is not quite
the right word.
Both gentIemen
are under house arrest.
Their passports
have been confiscated.
The NetherIands has shown itseIf
to be a bad Ioser.
They shouId accept the court's
decision, but they don't.
The gentIeman at the back.
Mr. van Hout,
what are your thoughts?
Do you reaIIy think
you're suffering an injustice?
WeII, I...
We were detained for a Iong time
awaiting the decision.
Now we have a decision.
Justice has been done,
and I think The NetherIands
shouId accept this.
What can you count on
if not the Iaw?
Mr. Humbrechts,
you"re smiIing.
What do you think?
I"ve got very IittIe to add.
I think it"s aII been said,
and there"s not much eIse
to say.
So I"d Iike to Ieave it
at that.
Sorry, Mr. Heineken.
It's okay.
WouId you beIieve it?
They're in a fucking hoteI.
He turned the ventiIation
on and off to torment me.
He knew it drove me mad.
He hates me.
He doesn't know
anything about you.
I'm changing things.
What things?
Joining in the drinking
with cIients.
His father isn't the onIy one.
One in five of our saIes reps
has a drinking probIem.
Did you know that
before the kidnapping?
It stiII doesn't give anyone
the right to mistreat you.
It doesn't?
Of course not.
I want us to agree
on something.
I've been on my own
for ten years now,
even though I'm married.
You have no idea
how IoneIy I've feIt.
I don't want that anymore.
It has to change.
If it doesn't,
I wiII Ieave.
Okay?
Okay.
You know...
there is one pIace
in the worId
where HoIIand and France
share a border.
- Is the minister expecting you?
- No.
Mr. Heineken?
I'd Iove some coffee.
A new extradition treaty
is being drafted.
Sooner or Iater,
they wiII be-
They'II soon be in Paraguay
on faIse passports.
Paris has assured me
they're not going anywhere.
Have you read this?
The French
wiII sign this treaty soon.
Just have some patience.
They can't be tried twice
for the same offense.
They won't be aIIowed
to go scot-free.
A soIution wiII be found.
It wiII take years.
I don't want that.
Can't you have them expeIIed?
No country wiII take them.
There's a pIace they can go.
A perfect pIace.
Get dressed.
We Ieave in five minutes.
What?
Where to?
Five minutes.
This is Mr. De Wit,
the Dutch consuI, and his wife.
WeIcome to Saint Martin.
The French consuI and
his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Dubois.
Sir, madam.
PIeased to meet you.
How was your fIight?
We survived.
I'd rather be kidnapped.
So what do you think?
You think
we're gonna need one?
[speaking indistinctIy]
You Iike it?
Fine. Fine.
Let me see.
I'II have one too.
Can I have two?
Yes, thank you.
Keep the change.
- Time to go.
- At Iast.
Get moving.
Rem.
Ladies and gentIemen,
FIight AX37 to destination
Saint Martin...
Hey.
JuIiana.
Must be named
after Queen JuIiana.
What about it?
JuIiana Airport.
They're taking us
to fucking Saint Martin.
PIease proceed.
It's the Dutch isIand
of Saint Martin.
Shit, you're right.
We're going to the French part
of Saint Martin, right?
If we get on this pIane,
it'II be over
in haIf an hour
when we Iand on Saint Martin.
I'm not going.
Come on, gentIemen.
No, no.
We're not going.
Get your hands off me!
We're not going!
George.
They're in GuadeIoupe,
but they refuse to Ieave there.
How far is it from here?
Some 250 kiIometers.
How big is your staff here?
1 42 peopIe.
Why?
Want to take over my company?
Can I give them the day off
at my expense?
It's been settIed.
They're taking us to the French
part of Saint Martin by boat.
They even got us a hoteI.
We have to report to the poIice
twice daiIy.
Apart from that,
we're free agents.
Even got seasickness piIIs.
You okay?
Read this.
The radio broadcast
has been set up.
Hi.
This is the text.
This is your text?
AII right.
Take a seat.
Look at this.
""CriminaIs On Saint Martin""
How the fuck is this possibIe?
It's an ad.
Someone paid for it.
Heineken.
He knows we're here.
Here he is:
Tommy Tom Tom, the Lion.
He speaks his mind,
and he's afraid of no one.
Listen.
These isIands beIong to us.
Hey, guys!
Listen to this!
If you mess with our isIands,
you mess with us.
Rem.
Don"t we have
enough parasites aIready?
The scum of Europe,
of Paris.
Now, Iisten.
Paris has dumped two more
of them on our shores.
They kidnapped Mister...
- Heineken.
- Heineken.
WiII we aIIow this isIand
to be poisoned
by parasites,
thieves, rapists...
and murderers?
Never!
I wiII describe them to you.
They are two Dutchmen.
They"re both big and taII.
They"re about 25 years oId.
One is bIond,
the other dark.
Their names are van Hout
and Humbrechts.
I"m asking you,
Tommy Tom Tom is asking you...
This is going wrong.
To find them.
AII criminaIs out!
Thank you.
We'II drive aII criminaIs
into the sea.
AII the criminaIs.
Fuck.
We have to get out of here.
Where do we go?
To the poIice.
Excuse me?
They have to protect us,
whether they Iike it or not.
Rem!
This window is broken.
There's no one here.
Let's go.
Damn it.
I shouId never have got you
invoIved.
It was my own idea,
remember?
Any regrets?
Regrets?
I wouIdn't have missed it
for the worId.
There they are!
What?
I don't understand
why you never Ieft me.
FeeIing guiIty?
Yes.
So you shouId.
Why did you stay with me?
Why is it so hard for you
to accept that there is someone
who Ioves you,
pIain and simpIe?
HeIIo?
Yes?
Thank you.
They've given up.
They've been taken
to the Dutch part of the isIand
and arrested.
I Iove you.
Mr. Heineken.
Three minutes?
We'II be right outside.
Why do you hate me?
Boo!
You're scared, aren't you?
You're scared of me.
Why?
After aII, I'm just a bum,
a dope from the wrong side
of Amsterdam.
AII right, Iet me out.
It smeIIs in here.
Someone shat their pants.
Eight years, ten at the most,
and I'II be out again.
Who knows, there may be a coupIe
of miIIions waiting for me.
And you?
You'II have to watch your back
for the rest of your Iife.
