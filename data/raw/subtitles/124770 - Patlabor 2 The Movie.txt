1999 SOUTH EAST ASIA
We have damage to legs 2, 4 and 5.
We've lost mobility.
- Can we use the other legs?
- I'll try, sir.
All units. Hold position.
There's a minefield behind you.
This is Gong 1: There are
troops ahead advancing on us.
It looks like one squad.
No, more than that.
Be careful. There's an
IRsource to the right.
Bearing 040, moving.
Range. 1200. Multiple targets.
It has a tank's heat signature.
It's entering RPG targeting range.
Gong to Command. We've been
surrounded by hostile troops.
Request permission to fire.
Request denied. Canadian
troops are en route.
I repeat, do not engage.
Take evasive action.
We cannot evade! Do you read?
Second heat signature!
- My eject's broken!
- Another heat signature!
I can't get out!
Captain!
BOOT. Okay.
System normal. Type XL. Standby.
System boot: Complete.
- Right. Go to visual scan mode.
- Roger.
It checks.
Downward scan: Check.
Rear scan: Check.
Hey, this isn't a game, Noah.
Auto-balancing: Nominal.
Proceeding with downward scan.
No obstacles ahead.
All right. Good run, Noah.
Let's reset and do it again.
Roger.
Simulation complete.
Maintenance team leader,
report to Booth 2.
Good work.
We've been doing this for three
months. You should be used to it.
Well, I'm not. You should
try that weird headgear.
- I did.
- And?
It made me sick, looking
out of my stomach.
Yeah! What was wrong
with the old Labors?
This is the perfect Labor interface.
It has to work underwater and in space.
Cones and rods are obsolete.
Cones and what?
Biological sensors. Your eyeballs.
There used to be a school that
taught people how to ride bikes.
Cars were an oddity
used only for racing.
But humans are very adaptable.
But it's just...
I know. Let's stop at the
hangar. That'll cheer you up.
Hi there.
- You two, again.
- Hello.
It's been a year since I last used him.
Yeah, time sure flies.
And now they're just
using him for tests.
Want to take him for a spin?
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
It's hard to explain.
That part of my life is over.
Come on. The cafeteria's opening.
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Time for dinner.
- Thanks, guys.
- Sure.
You idiot! You're supposed
to AIM at your target!
Get down and give me five laps!
Sakabe! Nishihori! Speed up!
Let's see some sprinting!
Hey, what are you slowing
down for, Kiseiyama?
Five more laps!
- Okay, next!
- Sir!
Ogura, no throwing up!
That'll cost you another five laps!
- I have a question.
- What?
Why bother with manual aiming?
Fire Control is 98% accurate.
And what if your FCS goes down?
Police Labors always act in
pairs, so the other Labor...
What if the FCS fails in both machines?
The odds of that are 10,000 to 1...
I have to prepare you
for that 1 in 10,000 case!
You idiot!
Give me 20 laps! Go!
He's certainly serious about
his training. I like that.
Let's hear a battle cry,
then prepare to fire!
But this isn't the marines.
Kids nowadays could care less
about "battle cries" and "spirit."
Out of my way! Watch how a pro does it!
Well, here we go again. Maybe
you'll talk to him this time.
It might have more weight
coming from the division chief.
Marksmanship requires
split-second timing!
Concentrate, and you'll hit
your target. Now, send it out!
Eat this!
I'm not done yet!
Don't relax after hitting your target!
- Move in and finish him off!
- What is the meaning of this?
Our budget can't afford this!
Report to me, immediately!
Captain!
Excuse me! Have you seen Captain Goto?
Hey, Boss! Have you seen Captain Goto?
What about Goto?
This guy's looking for him.
I think he's out back.
Thank you!
Have you seen the captain?
Yeah. He had a fishing pole.
He's probably out on the wharf.
Captain!
Captain!
What is it?
We got a call from Chief
Nagumo. She's been delayed.
Is it traffic or a late conference?
She didn't say.
I see.
- What's wrong?
- It's the end of our shift.
Could Division 1 take
over so we can go home?
I suppose so, but we should
wait for their commander.
That's true.
- Go ahead.
- It's okay?
Go on home. I have to stay, anyway.
Division 2 standing down. We
return to duty at 1200 tomorrow.
Dismissed. Good work.
- Excuse me, sir!
- See you.
No, it's not okay.
This indicates Labor use in
Tokyo and its surroundings.
Following the completion of
the Babylon Project last year...
you can see a clear shift
in Labor distribution.
Activity dropped once the
land bridge was finished.
With the Osaka Airport expansion
and other construction projects...
Labors have scattered
across the country.
Labor crimes showed a
similar scattering trend.
We established Labor Police
teams in Osaka and Kanagawa.
We're also looking at sites...
in Aichi, Miyagi and Chiba.
Chief Nagumo!
I'm glad you made it. It's
been a while, hasn't it?
We invited you over plenty of times.
You never came down.
Congratulations on your promotion.
It's nothing.
It was just a formality when
Second Section was reorganized.
A promotion is a promotion.
It was long overdue.
All the Tsuge graduates
are having a party.
We saved you a seat.
Tanaka and Watanabe will be
there. They said to bring you.
Sorry, but I'll have to pass.
Come on!
Aren't you over Tsuge yet?
Shut up.
I wonder how long it's been.
Mr. Tsuge got back from the UN
mission about three years ago.
Did he talk to you
before he disappeared?
Will you shut up!
I got one letter from him right
after he got back to Japan.
I'm sorry, but my division
is on call tonight.
Tell everyone hello.
Don't you have ANY tact?
Our most talented graduate
still has a broken heart.
Hello. Second Section.
Shige? This is Nagumo. I'm
finally done. How's it going?
It's pretty quiet. We
haven't had any calls.
Is Goto there?
Should I go get him? He's out back.
He should get a mobile
phone. No, forget it.
I'm already on the freeway.
I'll be there in 15 minutes...
Traffic jam.
Poor Captain. Take your time.
Nothing's happening here. Bye.
... a Labor is passing your vehicle.
Do not open your doors
or exit your vehicles.
This is the Kanagawa Traffic Police.
This is Captain Nagumo of
Metro Police, Second Section.
Come in.
This is Traffic Labor
201. Motohashi speaking.
I studied under you. Over.
I don't want to interrupt you...
but what's up?
There's an abandoned car on the bridge.
According to a tip,
it's got a bomb inside.
We're on our way to dispose of it.
Understood. Nagumo out. Thank you.
At 5.20 this evening...
there was a huge explosion
on the Yokohama Bay Bridge.
There are no reports of
death or injury, however...
... the Yokohama Bridge is
now closed to all traffic...
... traffic is still at a standstill.
An anonymous warning was
phoned in minutes earlier.
Terrorists are suspected...
The anonymous call to
Traffic Control is believed...
Witnesses report hearing a sonic boom...
just before the explosion.
Experts have now examined
the mysterious home video.
Thejet is
an F-16-J...
used by theJapan Self Defense Force.
In 1998, theJSDF purchased...
this improved version of the F-16.
The Self Defense Force initially
based these fighters at Misawa.
But over 130 such planes
are now in service.
TheJSDF is currently
verifying the location...
The Minister of Defense denies
any military involvement.
... suspicions continue to focus
on a military jet in connection...
TheJSDF has denied...
any link to the Yokohama
Bridge incident...
... formation of a special
investigation committee.
The Chairman assured the press...
This is a special report
on the Yokohama explosion...
A witness remembered seeing
your company at the bridge.
That's strange.
Sure, we were videotaping
at the bridge that day...
but we already handed our
tape over to the police.
Are you really with the police?
It did seem kind of strange. It
was yesterday, about 2:00 p.m.
He never told you his name or precinct?
No, but he was a dumpy
cop-type. Just like you.
Did you get a receipt
when he took the tape?
The owners must have handled that.
All I saw was a release
order from the client.
We do everything
by word-of-mouth.
Do you have a copy?
I can barely keep track of the original!
Once we hand over the master,
we recycle the working copies.
So, did you see the tape of
the F-16 they broadcast on TV?
I saw way too much of it. Why?
Your tape had more detail, didn't it?
It was a High-Vision tape.
Better than your home brands.
Maybe something showed up on it.
It caught the instant of explosion?
Not the instant, really. Just after.
So you saw the tape?
I saw it more times than
you can imagine. I edited it.
But I was under a deadline,
and I had to edit it fast.
I didn't have time to
go searching for clues.
If I had time, maybe I
could have found something.
There might have been
more clues on that tape.
I see.
That is something to think about.
I hate to waste your
time like this, but...
Not that again!
I said I'd repay you in kind. Okay. Bye.
Detective Matsui, right?
Yeah. He asked me to say "hi."
- Captain Goto?
- Yes?
I don't know what you
have going with Matsui...
but try to keep me informed.
Don't be too secretive, okay?
Is that an order from my commander?
Not an order. Call it a
request from a colleague.
Well, I can't ignore that, can I?
Excuse me.
Someone's here to see the captain.
We have two captains. Which one?
I don't know.
Who is he?
I don't know.
Ground Defense Force: Detached
Investigations. Mr. Arakawa.
There's no address or
phone number on this card.
I'm afraid I can't reveal them.
So, what can we do for you?
Before I get into that, there's
something I'd like you to see.
This.
If you don't mind...
Memories on the Bridge
Lyrics - Yoshiko Yuuka
Music - Kenji Kawai
Arrangement
- Kenji Kawai
- Is this the right tape?
- Definitely.
- I know the words. I could sing it.
- Do you feel like singing?
- I'd need a mike. -
Then I'll fast-forward.
Here.
"Trembling, trembling, crying, crying"?
Just past that. "Drenched
together in pouring rain." Here.
- Where?
- There, in the upper right.
Between the clouds.
Where? I can't see a thing.
Right here. This bird-like shadow.
I think Captain Goto has figured it out.
It was shot right before the explosion.
Keep that in mind while
you look at this next tape.
To prove it's authentic,
I recorded the entire edit.
Amazing what you can do
with digital enhancement.
See?
It doesn't look like the
plane they were showing on TV.
You're right.
Watch this.
Our image is on the left.
The right side is the
plane shown on TV news.
Notice the wing: The left
shows the new stealth wing.
The tail has a Vector Nozzle.
That's brand-new technology.
There isn't a plane like this...
in the entire Self Defense Force.
Hold on. Why are you showing this to us?
Because I need your help
in this investigation.
Also, if worse comes to worst...
I'll need a police contact.
In return, I'll give
you all our information.
What do you mean, "if
worse comes to worst"?
Would you come for a ride
with me? We won't go far.
It's so easy to relax
in a moving vehicle.
I do my best thinking here.
You sit in a serene stillness
while the world flows past you.
Not only that, it's harder
for people to eavesdrop.
Shall we get down to business?
The night the bridge was attacked...
a U.S. Fighter disappeared from
the base on Miyakejima Island.
The plane on your video?
The Americans reported it...
Privately, of course.
We don't always agree with them,
but our military forces cooperate.
They aren't in the habit...
of bombing their allies.
Why would the U.S. Want to attack us?
They weren't trying to attack anything.
The U.S. Military...
and even the pilot, were both victims.
I assume you'll explain that.
We've been watching a certain
syndicate for about a year now.
They're called the
National Defense Family.
It's a group of U.S.
Military advisers...
and defense contractors.
After the Cold War, they helped
fuel the arms race in Asia.
But they felt threatened
by Japan's lack of interest.
We're a nation of peace lovers.
So they decided to stir us up.
Remember 26 years ago...
when that Russian Mig pilot defected?
He panicked the entire nation
when he flew into our airspace.
Same thing.
A plane sneaks in and paints a
huge message on our front door.
It worked perfectly, too.
Except that the missile was armed.
An accident?
Maybe, but without proof...
we have to assume it was deliberate.
And the F-16 never
returned to its base.
Someone's gone to a lot of work
to stage this little melodrama.
- Why?
- Wait.
If you know so much,
why don't you go public?
- The Ministry of Defense...
- They already know.
The bureaucrats can't
decide what to say about it.
They suspect several groups...
but there isn't a shred of evidence.
Whatever they say...
there's bound to be a massive scandal.
They'll form an
investigative committee...
to cover their rears.
Get the picture?
The idiots! This is just
what the Defense Family wants.
And if the government
covers it all up...
We'll have another attack.
Before that happens,
I want to solve this.
Will you help me?
Mr... Arakawa?
Interesting story...
but it's all circumstantial evidence.
And you demonstrated...
how unreliable videotape can be.
Sorry, I just don't buy it.
Captain Goto, you're as
sharp as they say you are.
I picked the right man.
Even if both tapes were faked...
you can't deny the explosion.
Can you?
There's a file behind
the passenger seat.
Yukihito Tsuge. He's one of
the group's founding members.
He's also our top suspect...
but we can't track him down.
Anybody who's worked with
Labors should recognize him.
We aren't set up to find missing people.
And we can't officially
bring this to the police.
We ARE police officers.
They say that Captain Goto
has quite a few connections.
And Second Section can
circumvent regulations.
Or perhaps Second Section
just ignores regulations.
That's a misconception. We're
just public servants, like you.
Excuse me. It's me. What?
Don't forget that you
have two cops in the car!
They started sooner than I expected.
Three F-16-J fighters have taken
off from Misawa heading south.
They'll hit Tokyo
airspace in 20 minutes.
SIF confirms. The F-16-J
fighters belong to 3rd Flight...
under Northern Sector
Air Command's 8th Wing.
Call sign. Wyvern. They don't respond.
Area. H-2, K-1.
Bearing. 190.
Altitude.32,000. Air speed.270 knots.
Heading south.
Do you have Misawa on the line?
No response from any base,
not even Northern Air SOC.
Call them on the direct line!
Keep trying until you get them!
Could they be...?
Don't be stupid.
Interceptors have been launched.
Wizard 3 and 4 from Hyakuri and
Priest 21 and 22 from Komatsu.
Wizard intercepts at 2204 hours.
Priest intercepts at 2210 hours.
Toreboh, this is Wizard 03.
Maintaining an angel of 32.
Wizard 03, this is Toreboh.
You are under my control.
Steer 040. Maintain present angel.
Roger!
Wyvern continues south. No deviation.
Station SS-37.
Hand over to SS-27.
Interception at 2205 hours.
Wizard 03, target position 030.
Range. 90. Altitude.32.
Sir, what if they intercept
and there's still no response?
We have a connection to Northern SOC.
Northern SOC, this is Central SOC.
Recall your fighters!
Nothing in the air?
Misawa tower reports no takeoffs.
We're trying to get
direct confirmation...
but their radio and
phones are both down.
Check the location of your entire force!
- Top priority!
- Roger!
Sir!
The SIF codes just changed.
Could it be a system error?
The diagnostics would trigger
a shutdown in case of error.
Has Wizard made contact?
Target dead ahead 25.
Wizard 03, how about contact?
Negative contact.
Request target altitude.
When will the target
reach Tokyo airspace?
In about ten minutes.
Prepare the antiaircraft guns at Iruma.
And alert the director.
Toreboh, Wizard 03.
Negative contact. Bogey dope.
Target dead ahead 15.
Heading: 190. Altitude: 32.
Mach 1.2. Reduce speed!
No joy. Negative contact.
I say again. No joy.
Request target position.
Stop them! It's a collision course!
There's no time. It's too
late for a second pass.
Caution! Almost same
position. Same altitude!
Caution! Wizard, caution!
Wizard! Break! Wizard!
- Did they eject? Were they hit?
- Impossible!
Target course change.
New heading 210. Diving
and gaining speed.
They're closing with
Priest! Range.20 knots!
What's going on?
- They're headed this way!
- Is it an attack run?
It's just like the Bay Bridge!
Damn it!
Cancel approaches. All flights:
Gain altitude and await orders!
Watch your altitudes!
Reroute international flights to Osaka!
Weather conditions have delayed
all arrivals and departures.
All passengers and crew please stand by.
Targets bypassing Narita.
They'll hit Tokyo
airspace in 60 seconds!
Priest, we have radar contact.
We have a lock on Wyvern!
- You have permission to fire.
- But...
Don't let them reach the city!
Priest 21, this is Toreboh.
Clear fire. Kill Wyvern.
Toreboh, say again.
I say again. Kill Wyvern.
Roger. Kill Wyvern.
This is Wizard 03. Request
order. This is Wizard 03.
Priest 21, wait.
Wizard 03, this is
Toreboh. Are you normal?
Toreboh, this is Wizard.
We have heavy jamming
and have lost position.
Request further instructions.
I say again. Request orders.
Position confirmed on Wizard
03. No contact with bogeys.
Priest! Cancel attack!
- Priest is breaking off.
- Wyvern's disappeared!
F.I. Is awaiting instructions.
Stand down from alert. Order
Priest and Wizard back to base.
This is Wizard. Lost
position. Request orders.
I say again. This is
Wizard 03. Request orders.
Our Air Force computers...
were designed to be a closed system.
But our security was
crippled by politics.
We linked our mainframes
to the U.S. Bases.
Are you listening?
And the price was this fake invasion.
The culprits started in Germany
and used the American Internet.
That got them into the
American bases in Japan.
They then managed to get into
our mainframe at Central COC.
It may be possible in theory,
but can someone actually do that?
The current radar system
was installed in 1991.
But last year we added new
software to improve efficiency.
One of the programmers
probably worked for the Family.
And once again the truth will
be hidden from the public.
Neither the government nor the
JSDF can afford to admit this.
News about a hole in our
defenses would attract imitators.
More incidents would only
muddy this investigation.
Another invasion scare.
What do you have on Tsuge?
- You know about the Tsuge School?
- Just the basics.
It was a research group for the
development of walking machines.
They focused largely on
the military use of Labors.
Simulations proved that Labors
could be decisive in combat.
The JSDF issued grants to
start a new defense industry.
The project was named after
its central figure: Tsuge.
He volunteered for a UN mission.
He probably wanted to test his theories.
How well do you think Labors
stand up in the jungle?
All that heat and humidity
and no support or backup.
He knew the danger.
But he still volunteered. Why?
Did you know a police officer
attended the Tsuge School...
shortly before the creation
of the Mobile Police?
Shinobu Nagumo.
She was Tsuge's finest student.
He considered her his partner.
There was some sort of scandal,
but the details were covered up.
These things happen
between men and women.
It would have been fine
if he hadn't been married.
- Did you investigate?
- Everyone knew about it.
I didn't want to pry into the
personal life of a colleague.
Colleague? If you say so.
But the department never
forgives a moral lapse.
Her career should have
been on a fast track.
Instead, she's been exiled
to a landfill in the bay.
All because of Tsuge?
I couldn't say.
Captain!
You certainly have showy uniforms.
Yeah, it looks terrible on me.
At least you get normal clothes.
I wish I did.
I can't just wear plain clothes.
I have to blend in but still
look different from my targets.
We have to put up with
that in my line of work.
I see. See you later.
What's he after?
Is he trying to start
his own little war?
Trying?
He's already succeeded.
The only question left is: Who will win?
Captain Goto...
we're both officers serving our country.
What exactly are we trying to protect?
Japan hasn't seen warfare
since World War II.
You and I have lived our
entire lives in a time of peace.
Peace.
That's what we're fighting to protect.
But what does peace
really mean to Japan?
Once, our obsession
with war ended in defeat.
Then we had the American occupation.
America continued with the arms
race, Cold War and proxy wars.
Today, the globe is engulfed...
in racial violence and civil wars.
Japan's prosperity is built on...
the corpses from those wars.
Our peace comes from ignoring...
the misery in this world.
Other nations have been paying
the price for world stability.
But Japan has closed its eyes
to the suffering out there.
We may scorn the terms of peace...
but we must protect it.
And unjust peace is far
better than a just war.
I can understand your
hatred of"just" wars.
The despots of the world love to
launch their crusades forjustice.
People have fallen for that line...
throughout history.
But there's a fuzzy line...
between an unjust peace...
and a just war.
When liars use "peace"as a tool...
peace can no longer be trusted.
As war is followed by peace...
peace inevitably leads to war.
Someday we'll realize that peace...
is more than an absence of war.
Have you considered that?
We profit from war...
while the battle rages behind us.
We should remember how close
we are to the front lines.
Or maybe we're trying to forget.
But sooner or later, our
punishment will be handed down.
Punishment?
And who's going to punish us? God?
These days anyone can be a god.
Omnipresent and omniscient.
Creating strange new realities.
But God is impotent.
And if God doesn't act, then man will.
It will happen.
Unless we can stop them first.
I'm aware of that.
Yes...
That's why I don't think...
But, sir!
We have to be prepared
for that eventuality!
These orders come directly
from the Inspector General!
Tomorrow at 7.00 a.m., you
will activate all units.
You will report to Precinct Command.
And you will surround Nerima
Army Base. This is an order!
Are we mobilizing?
Shinobu?
The police ordered all planes
at Misawa to remain grounded.
The base commander
was driving to Tokyo...
to protest.
But as soon as his car left the base...
he was arrested.
Aomori's police chief
was always a toady...
but this is absurd!
Does he think he'll get away...
with an insult like that?
The base has cut communications
and is preparing for a siege.
How can you go wandering
off at a time like this?
Even if you were off
duty, you were still AWOL!
And you commandeered a
speedboat to go pick you up!
What about your promise
to keep me informed?
I'm sorry! Really!
But would you have given me
permission to go see Arakawa?
That man? Hardly.
And considering the circumstances...
a police officer shouldn't be
meeting with JSDF intelligence!
This is exactly why I
have to keep seeing him.
- What was that?
- Calm down and think about it.
Everybody sees a crisis and
feels they have to do something!
They rush into action without
considering the consequences.
Isn't that the problem?
When an emergency comes up,
it's our duty to help out.
But what's the best way to help?
There's been nothing but panic
ever since the bridge explosion.
They're desperate... the fighter
scare was a perfect example.
Central Air Command
actually ordered an attack!
Now our boss smells opportunity:
Why not show off the troops?
But will it really help, having
the police infuriate the army?
If Tsuge is really behind this...
he's quite a strategist.
He only needed a single missile...
to set his plan in motion.
Let's boycott the mobilization tomorrow.
I don't want to mobilize either.
But my orders come from
the Chief of Police.
My division won't do it.
I could order you to do it.
Go ahead. Order me.
Fine! From now on, our divisions
are completely independent!
I'll move to the station chief's
office since it's available.
Wait! That's not what l... Shinobu?
I'll collect my things later. Excuse me.
But... Moving out won't make me do it!
Shinobu?
I've changed my mind.
Yes, just now.
This is the scene
above Nerima Army Base.
Yesterday, Misawa Air Base
sent a call for help...
and their comrades in theJSDF
have answered that call.
Even Tokyo's elite 1 st
Division has joined the alliance.
Hey!
Why haven't you mobilized your Labors?
Your Labors are still on their
trailers! Explain yourself!
Oh, these? They're malfunctioning.
Malfunctioning? Second Section
wouldn't send out broken Labors.
- Don't lie to me!
- It's true.
Well, you can still
stand them up. Do it.
They are malfunctioning.
If one of them fell...
it would embarrass us on national TV.
Is this an order?
You're trying to undermine my authority!
I'll report this to the chief!
Consider yourself warned!
- Goto here.
- It's me. I'm watching it all on TV.
Having problems?
The Inspector General panicked
once his toady went too far.
Our idiotic boss is
only making it worse.
It's the same for us.
The military is fine. It's just
the top commanders that are bad.
The head of each division just quit.
They resigned en masse.
Really?
That was about 30 minutes
ago. It'll hit the news soon.
They'll finally tell the
truth about the Bay Bridge...
but no one will believe
them after this disaster.
The Americans will deny it.
So now we can't reveal the truth...
and our best way to
control the crisis is gone.
Another support beam has
just been knocked away.
Are you still listening?
Yeah, though I'd rather not be.
Well, keep listening
