Hello?

Yes.
I'm calling from

What's going on?
Sophia Liao is in a coma
in our hospital.
What?
What?
I'm sorry.
[IN CHINESE] Ms. Liao was on her bike

Okay, I'm coming.

Please don't bring this music

Look how oily they are.
Sophia.
When your mother died,
I promised her I'd raise you properly.
When you act out,
I can't fulfill your mother's final wish.
I know I'm only
your stepmother.
Are you going to be
against me forever?
Huh?
Nina, I'd like to have a word with you.
Follow me.

That liar. She never met my mother.
[TERESA TENG'S "YUE LIANG

I already told you they come from Korea.
SOPHIA:
I didn't come to Shanghai till I was 14.
[IN CHINESE]
That's why my Chinese is so bad.
Very good.
SOPHIA: Thank you.
[IN ENGLISH] Shanghai is a seaport.
Everyone from somewhere else.
People come and they go,

It's a shoe?

NINA:
Oh, no.
She's talking about

I think I got that right, huh?
Mm-hm.
And her name was
Snow Flower...
...and she had
a laotong named Lily.
Laotong?
Sworn sisters for life, laotong.
Like us.
NINA: Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister. Ha, ha.
AUNT: Girls, you have a lot to learn
about laotong commitment.
See, marriages used to be made
for men's reasons.
To form business alliances,
to manage households, to produce sons.
And they were obligatory.
A laotong's commitment
was for women's reasons, by choice.
For companionship,
understanding and happiness.
What you're signing today is a symbol
of your deep-hearted love for each other.
Deep-hearted love.
I like that.
[IN CHINESE]
Here is your laotong contract.
Your vow is written
in nu shu.
Sign below it.
AUNT: Oh, yes.

SOPHIA [IN CHINESE]:
This is the story of Snow Flower and Lily.
Two girls born in the same month,
on the same day.
Their feet bound on the same day.
At that moment,
their destinies tied forever.
[LILY GIGGLING]
[CRACKING]
[WHIMPERING]
Mama, when can I go out to play?
Lily, this is more important.
We must make your feet perfect so the

Madam, it is done.
Get up, walk.
Get up!
Walk.
[GASPS]

Mama, it hurts.
Ten circles of the room.
Snow Flower! What are you doing?
Come back! Walk!
LILY'S MOTHER:
Only through pain will you find beauty.
Only through suffering
will you find peace.
I wrap, I bind.
But you will have the reward.
Come.
[GROANING]
Back, again.
Again.
Mama!
[SOBS AND WHIMPERS]
[CHATTERING]
These are the most perfect feet
I have ever seen.
These are true golden lilies.
I will be able to find her a good family.
But given your circumstances...
...we must make another match first.
I have found you a laotong.
Your sister in heart for life.
Her name is Snow Flower,
and she is from Tongkou.
Tongkou?
A rich girl is too good
for my daughter.
This is true.
Her family is privileged.
Her grandfather was
an imperial scholar.
But these girls
have compatible astrology signs...
...so her mother does not mind
this class difference.
Can I meet her now?
Snow Flower?
Nu shu is a secret language
between women.
It is personal,
between you and your laotong.
That is why you learn it together.
So you will know what is in her heart.
LILY:
Bright.
Moon.
Correct?
Yes.
The Temple of Gupo fair is a holy place.
We are here today in front of Gupo
to write your laotong contract.
And make your vows
of eternal commitment.
My hand opens to yours.
[IN UNISON]
We of good affection...
...shall never sever our bond.
We will be laotong for all eternity.
Why can't you grow up?
Your mother's right.
You don't get these
opportunities every day.
You have to go to New York.
You shouldn't feel guilty.
Her accident had
nothing to do with you.
Enough.
Stop trying to convince me.
I've decided to stay.
I don't even know what her life
was like these past few months.
Now, with this accident,
I need to find out what happened to her.
[LINE RINGING]
[IN ENGLISH]
Uh, hi, Sebastian. It's Nina.
[SIGHS]
I'm not sure
when I can meet you in New York.
I....
I just can't leave.
I need to be here for Sophia.
Sorry.
I'll be at the house.
Call me when you land.
Bye.
LILY:
I am to marry a boy I do not know.
He is from a distinguished family.
My life will change
because of my perfect feet.
Sister, you must come to my wedding.
[ALL SINGING IN CHINESE]
Has Madame Wang found you a match,
Snow Flower?
What about bed business?
Mama has never said
anything to me.
It cannot be as hard as
embroidery or cleaning.
[LAUGHING]
Why are you laughing?
Stop laughing at me.
[ALL SINGING IN CHINESE]
LILY:
I am not a good daughter for leaving you.
[SIGHS]
We are women.
We are born to leave
our families.

Never forget we are vowed forever.
No one will come between us.

Within this household,

LADY LU:
Obey, obey, obey.
He will do what he wants.
My father has granted me permission
to travel to Guilin to buy salt.
I will return and sell it here.

Yes, Sophia gave us these.
They all belong to her family.
But the most important one

Perhaps Sophia has it.
CLAIRE: This is a new

LILY: You taught me how to be a good wife.
I must fulfill all my duties.
The wife of the eldest son
must serve and honor her mother-in-law.
My daughter's birth was a disappointment.
I must bear a son.
Madam, I would like to visit
Snow Flower...
...and go to the Temple of Gupo fair.
We promised to meet there every year.
I told you, Lily.
I do not approve of your relationship
with Snow Flower.
She is my laotong.
We are vowed forever.
Why do you forbid me to go?
You must go pray for a son.
Yong Gang will go with you.

Take this to Snow Flower.
LILY: We must rely on the wind

Those winds are happy and sad.
We are forbidden to see each other.

How does your husband treat you?
And yours?

However, I do not know why
Lady Lu disapproves of you.
But I am still here.
I am happy.

You're here.
I flew all night and all day

When she first came back from Australia,
she came to see me at the gallery.
How was she?

She seemed...
...very depressed.
And she was more depressed
the next few times I saw her.
She didn't even want me to know

Why?
Did she come back with Arthur?
No. She told me she left him.

Nobody knows where she lives?
No.

I should have told you earlier.
But I could not bear to tell you the truth.
My father was addicted
to the opium pipe.
He ruined our family.
Our fates have been reversed.
But our love will always be strong.

We are fulfilling our fates.
But now the typhoid epidemic is upon us.

How can you talk to me like that,

I just wanna tell you,
he's not right for you.
How do you know?
So it's all my fault.
Okay, fine.
I won't bother you anymore.
I'm going to New York.
Good.
He will not tell me
where our son is buried.
My husband takes his sadness
and stuffs it into his fists.
So much has happened
in the years we were apart.
Fate has taught me
that I am just another woman.
I hope when I am reunited

Has your revered husband never
shown you that he loves you?
I seek only to help you

If I give this message
to Lady Lu...
...she will misunderstand
your meaning.
Your bond may be broken forever.
This is my intention.
My sister is at a different station
in her life.
I have become a burden to her.
She is far too stubborn and loyal
to accept this.
What you are about to do
will break her heart.
And mine, but it will set her free.
Loving her as I do, it is the only way.
Lady, I am Lotus.
I know who you are.
What do you want?
My sister asked me to return
this to you.
SNOW FLOWER:
My dear laotong:
My fate has brought me many sorrows.
I cannot be what you wish.

She was holed up there

It's near her father's old bathhouse.
Bathhouse?

Where her father would go to escape
from his wife and the stock market.
And Sophia would wait for him.

How could you know
how i felt all these years...
...about what you did for me?
How could I bear another sacrifice?
Giving up your future in New York...
...and yet...
...i knew your love was too strong.
There would be no asking you
to change your mind.
I had to make you hate me.
And so I lied.
I lied about wanting to move out...
...needing to be free.
The reason i moved to Sydney was
because I was pregnant with Arthur's baby.
But then I guess it was not meant to be.
ARTHUR:
I know what you think of me.
That....
That I didn't deserve her.
You're right, I didn't.
I mean, when we were
first together...
...Sophia would disappear for,
I don't know, a few hours every night.
She'd never tell me
where she'd been.
I assumed she was seeing someone else,
so one night, I followed her.
Where was she going?
To a bathhouse
in Luwan.
I mean,
the weird thing was...
...the bathhouse was restricted
to men only.
She had to disguise herself
to get in there.
Yeah.
She wore a suit, right?

[IN CHINESE]
Excuse me.
My father left
something here.
His locker number is 173.
I'm here to get it for him.
[IN CHINESE]
We're not open yet. They're still cleaning.
Old Ding, leave us alone.
This lady has some business here.
Please be quick.
Thank you.
SOPHIA [IN CHINESE]:
The end of this story...
...is about things of the heart
that will never change.
Madam.
What is wrong, child?
My mother is very sick.
She calls for you in her sleep.
But she has other sisters.
She has no other sisters.
She misled you.
She has never had
another laotong.
For 10 years,
she was only their teacher.
She has only one sister of the heart.
You have to see her one last time.
I beg you.
I waited for you.
YONG GANG: Madam, I brought you
some things from home.
I am sorry.
I knew you could not want me
to destroy the fan.
NINA: When Lily returned home
after Snow Flower's funeral...
...she looked at the fan and could not
allow things to end as they had.
So she opened a new panel...
...dipped her brush,
and wrote a final inscription.
The world is always changing.
Every day it's changing.
Everything in life is changing.
We have to look inside ourselves
to find what stays the same...
...such as loyalty...
...our shared history...
...and love for each other.
In them, the truth of the past lives on.
Now I understand Lily's last inscription
for Snow Flower...
...and what it means for Sophia and me.
My entire life, I have longed for love.
I always thought I understood it...
...but now i see,
with shame and sorrow...
...that i understand nothing
of deep-hearted love.
The love between sisters.
So many years without you.
This is my penance.
If you will come back to me...
...i will never leave you.
Never again.
And we will be sisters for 10,000 years.
