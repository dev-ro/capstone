Long live the liberators of Vukovar.

[Man] Today, the city
of Vukovar has fallen.
It is now no more
than a heap of rubble.
In the past two months,
the Serbs have pounded it...
with more than
two million shells.
These survivors are
heading for Bosnia...
hoping to escape the war.
But tonight we must face
the possibility...
that this is
only the beginning.
# We strolled through the fields
all wet with rain #
# And back along
the lane again #
# There in the sunshine #
# In the sweet summertime #
# The way that
young lovers do #
# I kissed you
on the lips once more #
# And we said good-bye
at your front door #
# In the nighttime #
# Yeah, that's the right time #
# To feel the way #
# That young lovers do #
# Then we sat down
our hearts started dreams #
# Of the way that we were #
# And the way
that we wanted to be #

Others are going to be

Go fuck your mother!
- [Cameraman] Oh, shit.
- [Reporter] Easy!
[Chattering]
- Huh?
- I dunno.
- Hey there. What did you get?
- We need a new driver.
What? Do you know
what it took to get Joey?
He used to be a cabbie.
He knows the city inside out.
- You know? He speaks...
- He's an idiot.
He's been selling our petrol.
And he's an idiot.
Just been running around the streets
of Sarajevo trying to find him.
Nearly got us killed. Does anybody care
about that? Is it true about the petrol?
- It was full this morning, and it's empty now.
- All right, all right.
[Fire Crackling,

- [Reporter] That's it, from there. Now, another three.
- [Cameraman] Oh, that's good.
- [Cameraman] Four... five.
- [Reporter] "No one dares move the body."
- Then the boy.
- This could come in now...
- [Reporter] No, go to the boy.
- I just saw this footage of Flynn being shot at.
- Have we got any of that?
- No.
- Why not?
- Why not what?
Why has everyone else
got this footage and not us?
I blame the general decline
in journalistic standards.
It's all this "news as entertainment"
bollocks, isn't it?
So patronizing.
I hate that.
I hate that too.
How about you, Jane?
I actually think
that what he did was very brave...
and most people
respond to bravery.
O-Ohh!
[Flynn] They were just yards from the
church when the sniper opened fire...
and now the bride's mother is dead, another
innocent victim killed in cold blood.
- [Applause]
- This is Jordan Flynn in Sarajevo.
Thank you! But, uh,
I'm not worthy of your applause...
but I will take your money.
Thank you. Oh, thank you!
You'll be remembered.
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.
O-ho! Well, look who's here.
Henderson. And Gregg.
- Care to make a contribution?
- Sorry, I don't have anything small enough.
- I'm sure you do, but I was thinkin' about money.
- Ah!
What do ya think?
Syndicated worldwide?
Yes, your producers
must be delighted.
"De-lighted" is exactly what they are.
You hit the nail on the head.
I assume they sent you here
in the hope you'd get yourself killed.
- It looks as if you will. Well done. Good night.
- Good one!
Henderson, how about
a little Bushmill's?
Hey, Gregg. Bushmill's.
- See ya.
- Come on.
[Irish Accent] I can't believe you're
turnin' down a Bushmill's. There's a first.
- [Man] I'll take it. Flat.
- [Flynn] Well, thank you.
I suppose he was
only trying to help.
- We're not here to help. We're here to report.
- Yeah.
[Gregg] Haven't seen
Bushmill's in a long time.
Michael, are you all right?
- Michael, are you all right?
- Yeah.
Good.
[Door Opening]
- All right, we're gonna drink to the line.
- Yeah, lower. Please.
- Better.
- I always try to make my most important decisions...
after reaching that line.
- I liked what you did. I thought it was really brave.
- Really?
- I thought it stank.
- [Laughing] Oh, God.
- You thought it stank?
- Yeah, it wasn't about Sarajevo. It was about you.
Well, you know,
oddly enough, back home...
- no one's heard of Sarajevo, and they've all heard of me.
- [Guffaws]
- Oh, right.
- Is she with you? - Freelance.
Freelance. Oh, figures.
Who would hire her?
Um, no, you see, they say
you should never drink...
serious whiskey without water...
because the strength of the alcohol
smothers the complexity of the flavor.
- Oh, now, is that right?
- [All] Chiverly!
- [Explosion]
- Oh, my God!
Oh, God.
- Jane?
- Mm-hmm?
I am in love with you.
In spite of the company you keep.
- Thank you.
- And I would like to take you away from all this madness.
Oh, are you leaving so soon, Mr. Flynn?
The war is so young.

- Hi.
- Hello, Zeljko.
- Well, I managed to get you a phone call, sir.
- Ah!

- Very good.

- There you go.
- Right. Thanks. Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.
- Hello?
- Helen. Hi. It's me.
- [Machine] Neither Michael nor Helen are here at the moment...
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

- Yeah, hang on.
Sorry, I-I put it on
when I was putting the kids to bed.
- It's okay.

- I bought it at Marks and Spencer in Paris.

- Oh, great.
- This is our new driver. This is Flynn.
- Oh, hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, dig those threads!
- Yeah. It's a really great color. It's sort of unusual.
- Yeah.
- Not too showy.
- Oh, my man, Zeljko. Thank you.
- It's my favorite.
- Do you have it?
- Oh, brother. - Four of them.
- I'll just go and find Michael.
You are a prince.
Take 'em.
- This will do nicely. Thank you.
- Oh, suit yourself.

Mm.
Ah!
- For the head. You need a hangover cure?
- Mm-hmm.
Uh, would you mind
if I save it till later?
- I haven't started my hangover yet.
- Go ahead.
Go ahead. Take 'em.
All I need's one. Take 'em.
I mean, he's here now.
His English is pretty good.
He studied in, um...
Birmingham, or Bristol.
- Hi, er, Mr. Henderson.
- "Man at C & A." Hello.
- Er, Marks and Spencer.
- What?
Uh, C & A do a jacket
with a similar cut...
but only Marks and Spencer
do it in this color.
- Michael, mortar attack. Come on.
- Uh, joke.
[Henderson] That's four days
in a row I haven't had breakfast.
- Did you get the job?
- Yes.
Congratulations.
I brought you some hotel soap.
Wash and maybe Alma will marry you.
Harun, the man got the job.
Hey!
Hail the conquering hero.
Well done.
Look what I've got.
Egg! Thank you!
- No, two.
- Two eggs. Two eggs is a miracle!
- Three eggs! Is there words for three eggs?
- Omelette?
- Omelette.
- [Bosnian] That's right, omelette.
Ajsha, fix us an omelette.
Do it yourself.
Come on, Ajsha.
You go first.
No, Dragan, I can't.
You're going first.
- I don't want to be a wanker.
- Go on.
Mm-mm!
Risto, have some. Come on.
No thanks.
I'll wait till this is over.
Where did you go today?
To the bread queue.
- It's in Vazim Mezgana.
- Do you know where that is?
- Yeah, boss.
- Okay. You drive.
- Okay.
- Who's got the keys?
- [Horns Beeping]
- [Shouting]
- Hi. Is it all right if I bum a lift?
- Uh, this is Annie.
- Annie McGee. Shall we make a move?
- That's good.
[Annie] Look, I know this probably
isn't the best time, but, uh...
- I wanted to talk to you about a story I'm working on.
- Talk to me? Why?
I need papers,
transport, and stuff.
If you need transport, you need to talk
to Jane Carson. She's the producer.
- I'm just the journalist.
- Do you mind if I smoke? - No.
This could be the most important story
of the war, Henderson.
More important than...
b-bombing people in the street?
- Compared to that, it seems like fucking Jane Austen.
- Really?
I never fucked Jane Austen.

[Henderson] There's a little one here.
He needs to come in front.
[Henderson] For these children,
home is the Ljubica Ivezic Orphanage...
on one of Sarajevo's
many front lines.
...all them are inflicting
on this town.
[Jane]
You should wear them. All of you.
- I don't mind. I quite like them.
- Everyone else is wearing them.
That, um, R.T.L. driver,
he was saved because of his.
You should take one.
You should wear it on the petrol run.
- [Risto] No way. - [Game Pieces Clattering]
- [Jane] Oh, sorry.
[Jane] I don't know if we can
get insured without them.
- Michael, look. I know you don't like them...
- Shush! Listen.
These are their graves.
I, uh, buried these children
here in the garden because...
- [Henderson] Wonder if she can get
insured without one... everyone can see.
[Woman] We are dying. So I will
not put them away out of sight.
Everyone must know
we are dying.
So, tell them. Keep on telling them
until I hope they will move us.
If it is possible to treat
the children on the spot...
near to their families, with people
around them who speak their language...
and in relatively
familiar surroundings...
then that is obviously
the best way.

Orphanages and hospitals are
being shelled on a daily basis.
Are there any plans
to evacuate the children and the sick?
We are here to consider
a range of options.
I know it's difficult, uh, but we have
to keep a sense of perspective.
We have to deal with 13 countries
in the world...
which are worse than Sarajevo.
Uh, excuse me, sir,
just out of curiosity...
could you tell me what
those 13 places are...
and are we slidin' up
or down that scale?

Zaned is from a village
near Sarajevo.
His father and two older brothers were
taken prisoner by Serb irregulars...
the feared Chetniks.
His mother was shot by a sniper
whilst queuing for water.
[Jane] I've got a letter of permission
from Radovan Karadzic.
We can use it
to get behind Serb lines.
If you've got permission from Karadzic,
it can't be much of a story, can it?
Anyway, we've got 50 kids who could be
blown apart at any moment...
and nobody's payin'
the blindest bit of attention.
- What more do you want?
- We've done that story.
No, we haven't done that story. We started
that story. Kids are still there.
The U.N. are here. As long as the U.N. are here,
I'm going to keep those kids on the screen.
Every night, different child,
same message. "Get me out of here."
That's not news.
That's a campaign.
I don't care what it is.
I'm gonna get those kids out of here.
What's the problem? Big guns, little
children, evil men. Great television.

Since the war, the orphanage

have witnessed terrible events...
as well as being separated
from their families.

"she went to work and was told she couldn't
work there anymore because she was a Muslim.
That day it was announced

It's a Haggadah.
- It's the story of the Exodus.
- Oh.
It was in the national museum,
and when the Nazis came, it disappeared.
- [Bosnian]
- As soon as the war was over, it was back in the museum...
and now it's disappeared again.
- It's lovely.
- Yeah, it's nice.
Yeah, but on the real one,
you can see the fingerprints...
- and wine stains when it's been used.
- [Chuckles] Really?
[Man] Yeah, but people say that
after this war, it'll come back...
but it's been sold
to buy the weapons.
No, that's not true.

But I'm not going to do it yet.
Because, you know, Sarajevo is only

The Bosnian government has set
itself against any kind of evacuation.
From their point of view,
the Serbs want the city empty.
If they evacuate,
we're helping the Serbs.

collaboration."

It's extraordinary, is it not,
that when there are children...
trapped in the most dangerous corner
of the most dangerous city on Earth...
that this plane is going to fly
out of here completely empty.
It would be a simple matter
to move the children...

It was a real party.

Yeah. Uh, uh, I was with...
I was with your son.

You speak Bosnian, eh?
[Flynn] When I try to describe this
stuff in English, it doesn't sound real.
So I figured if any language could
do it justice, it might be Bosnian.

History has shown us...
that you can't allow
the mass extermination of people...
and just sit by
and watch it happen.
We do not see
any evidence of a program...
of systematic or massive killing
of innocent people.
Fifty and sixty years ago,
the leaders of the world said...
"Oh, we didn't know it was happening,
and it was misinterpreted."
We know what's happening now.
Don't, don't, live
under this dream...
that the West is going to come
in and sort this problem out.
Do you want these?
Mm. Mm! What do you say
we smoke one of these?
Don't start, Flynn.
Once you start, you never stop.
Well, if you're not smokin', and you're
not drinkin', what are you doin'?
- Staying alive.
- [Laughs]
- Here. Have this as well.
- What?
I think I might...
I might...
get the hell out of here
and go home.
- [Exhales]
- What do ya think?
Great.
I could cover the Republican convention,
maybe, uh...
- How about, uh, the Super Bowl?
- Super Bollocks!
- Super Bollocks?
- Why is it that when Americans are playing...
- Why is it?
- Why is it that Americans...
when they're playing sport, they wear
so much padding? All your games...
You spend more time dressing up,
than you do playing.
Sure, we don't dress
to the nines, like cricket.
But what about basketball?
Just a vest.
Basketball isn't a sport.
- Basketball is a freak show.
- Easy. You're on very sacred territory.
The side that breeds the tallest
player wins. Also, it's a girls' game.
- As is baseball.
- Do you know, only two good things ever came from England.
One: America.
Two: The Beatles.
Beatles aren't English.
They're from Liverpool.
You even pad up
to play girls' games.
You know, Henderson...
- [Coughs, Inhales] ...those orphans
are not your responsibility.
- You're here. You're a reporter. You're here to report.
- [Explosion]
Fuck you, asshole!
Get a job!
Hi, Zeljko. Would you
take care of these?
- Mr. Henderson. You're leaving?
- Yes.
- Have some of those. I don't smoke.
- Thank you very much.
Okay.
[Jane]
Yeah, 85. You?
- Oh, hi there.
- Hi.
- Good night?
- Yeah, very good.
- Hi.
- This is Nina.
Hello. Welcome to the fourteenth-worst
place on Earth.
Thanks.
- Nina's an aid worker.
- Is this water?
- Yeah. Please, please.
- May I? Thank you very much.
Yeah, children's charity.
The Children's Life Line.
We've got a bus. We brought in food,
and we're taking out kids.
Trying to pitch our story
to your network.
- What sort of children?
- Boys and girls.
Children who are sponsored abroad,
or who have relatives abroad.
And babies, I'm taking babies.
- They're easy to find homes for.
- I can get you babies.
There's an orphanage
on the front line.
- Do you need babies?
- I thought you were leaving.
You could leave.
You could leave with us.
An epic story for you.
The Exodus.
[Excited Chattering]
[Babies Crying]
[Mrs. Savic]
Can you help any of them?
Yeah. We'll try.
We'll try.
Emira! Look how funny it is.
- It's for the baby.
- That's for the baby.
- Your brother or sister?
- Is it your brother or sister?
No.
- What's her name?
- Roadrunner.
Mr. Henderson may take
some babies on a convoy.
What about me?
[Translator]
She thinks that she's going.
You promised me.
- [Baby Crying]
- [Translator] She says, "You promised me."
[Crying]
[Nina] No, no. It's okay if we don't
have the original birth certificate.
[Mrs. Savic]
Here they are.
If she had somewhere to go,
could you take her?
- Nina?
- What?
Emira. She's one of the older girls.
She wants to leave.
Well, does she have
somewhere to go?
- No.
- No, I can't take her.
With the older kids, we have to prove
they're visiting relatives.
No evacuation.
That was the deal we made.
What if she was going
to visit me?
What do you mean?
- Uh, just if she was coming to London, to visit me.
- It's not that simple.
Mrs. Savic?
I can't speak for her.
You'll have to ask her yourself.
- [Bosnian]
- [Henderson] What's that? Is that ayes?
- [Distant Gunfire]
- [Mrs. Savic] Yes. That's yes.
I thought she might
want to stay.
She's been with me always.
[Sighs] But it's okay.
I'm glad she doesn't.
Well, it's just for a short time.
Until the war's over.
Yeah. For a short time.
I hope so.
[Distant Gunfire Continues]
Hello, TV man.
Got any cigarettes?
What's the matter?
Leaving already?
Bye-bye.
[Automatic Weapons Firing]
- You know this is completely illegal, don't you?
- Yes.
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't know.
Married?
- Yes.
- Kids?
- Yes.
- Okay...
I don't want anyone to know
about what you're doing.
Not your news crew,
not your producer, no one.
I don't want you
to sit near her on the bus.
I want you to treat Emira
just like all the other kids.
Right.
I'm very grateful.
- [Chattering]
- [Henderson] At last, there is some...
good news for the children
of the Ljubica Ivezic Orphanage.
Five of the babies have got places
on a convoy taking children to Italy...
where they can stay
till the fighting is over.
They'll have to leave behind more than
a hundred older children...
who haven't been so lucky.
Their daily struggle to survive
seems to have no end.
- [Guns Firing]
- The babies are not out of danger yet.
Land mines, mortars,
and roadblocks are just some...
of the hazards that lie between them
and the safety of Italy.
Only last week,
snipers opened fire on a bus...
as it tried to leave Sarajevo.
Two babies were killed.
[Henderson] Are you worried
for the safety of the children?
Yes, I am, but we have
a one-hour cease-fire...
throughout Sarajevo, and we have
the permission from authorities...
on all sides to bring
these children to Italy.
And what's the alternative?
To leave them here?
- [Children Chattering]
- [Henderson] The mothers of the children leaving today...
clearly feel it is more dangerous
to stay than to go.
Emira. There you are!
Is Roadrunner all right?
Did you change her nappy?
This is for you, and this is
for Roadrunner.
You know, I'd like to apologize
on behalf of the American people...
for our failure to deliver
on those air strikes.
Can't help but think that if
the situation were reversed, and the...
Muslims were slaughtering Christians,
we would have done something by now.
- Don't worry.
- Okay.
Nobody is going to kill me.
- Okay.
- Take this.
[Inaudible Dialogue]
[Bosnian]
[U.N. Official] We have
safe passage through this street.
- [Bosnian]
- This is the street, right? No, no, we...
Door, please.
- Back!
- What's happening?
They won't let us through.
We need to take a different route.
They're sending us
the long way around.
[U.N. Official] Back. Everybody, back.
Will you get back on the bus, please?
[Baby Crying]
[Inaudible Dialogue]
[Brakes Hissing]
[Baby Crying,
Angry Voices Outside]
I'm sorry about this.
They insist on searching the bus.
You'll have to get everybody off.
All right?
Okay. Okay, they want
to search the bus.
- So we all have to get off quickly. It's gonna be okay.
- [Translator Speaking Bosnian]
[Nina] Okay, come on. Come on.
Stay close. Come.
Back on the bus. We're all right. Okay,
we're okay. We're going. We're moving.
[Bosnian]
[Children]
Wow! Yay!
[Speaking Bosnian]
It's... It's really like

She's a girl from Sarajevo.
She's from the orphanage.
I wanted to call you earlier,
but I didn't know what to say.
- How old is she?
- She's nine.
Look, I don't really know
why I've done this.
She somehow thought that
I could help her get out...
and I realized that I could, and then there
didn't really seem to be any reason not to.

Oh, here I badgered the network into
getting me one of these satellite phones.
I'm selling calls on the side
and making a fortune.
I hope the war keeps up.
Listen, the woman I love... you know, one way...
wants to talk to you. Brace yourself.
- Hi, Michael.
- Hi, Jane.
How's the kid?
Oh, yeah, good. You know,
complicated but good.
- Does she want to come back?
- No.
The thing is that, uh...
someone here wants her
to come back.
Someone like who?
The uncle contacted us here.
She has a mother, Michael,
and she wants her back.
Sorry, Michael.
Shouldn't have brought her out.
Of course you should.
What's it going to be like for her now
going back into that?
- It's stupid.
- Maybe she won't have to go back.
- Huh?
- Huh?
Maybe she won't
have to go back.
I didn't know she had a mother.
I know. I know.
- When are you going?
- Tomorrow.
- How long will you be?
- I don't know.
I have to find your mother.
I don't know where she is.
I have to get her
to sign some papers...
and then we can adopt you.
What if she says no?
She won't.
Don't worry.

Michael.
Welcome to hell.
Brought you some Mars bars.
Left them in the hotel.
Fantastic. I started
to get cravings.
It's like being pregnant,
you know?
This week it's dental floss.
I never flossed my teeth in my life.
But I don't know...
I want some floss now.
And before that, warmth.
Oh, yeah.
- You haven't changed, Risto.
- Yes, I have.
- I lost my innocence.
- I don't remember you having innocence.
I used to think my life
and the siege were different things...
and now I realize there is no life
in Sarajevo apart from the siege.
The siege is Sarajevo.
If you're not part of it, you are
dreaming, you are asleep. I don't know.
You've killed someone.
Yes. It was not so bad.
I don't know... therapeutic.
I'm sorry, it's a bit dark
and cramped here.
We're all refugees here.
Zivko came to our village, put us
on a bus and told us to leave.
These are of, uh,
Emira's mother.
She looks...
She looks like Emira.
No, I know.
I'm just saying she looks like her.
[Speaking Bosnian]
[Speaking Bosnian]
He says her family made her
give the baby up.
- And now he want to help.
- Yeah.
- Is this her address?
- She's lost so much.
We've all lost in this war.
If something could be returned
that's ours...
...we'd like to have it back.
[Gunshots]
[Soldier] Ciao.
Who's next?
ZIVKO
This is where
they want her to live?
- Ready to play Sarajevo's favorite game?
- What's that?
It's called

- Where does Munira Hodzić live?
- Down there somewhere.
Do you know
where Munira Hodzić lives?
Hey. I know.
Follow me.
- Does he know?
- I don't know.
- I don't think we should go with him.
- Why?

Anglais, thank you very much!
- [Henderson] Now what?
- [Risto] Don't bring her back here, Michael.
- I'm trying not to, Risto. That's why I'm here.
- Yeah, but promise me.
- What?
- Promise me.
All right. All right.
I promise.
No one should have
to come back to this.
[Harun] Look, there are
compensations to being in a siege.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. There's this girl called Inela.
Inela. I went
to school with her.
- She's the most beautiful girl in the world, no question.
- [Jane] Sex goddess?
But she doesn't
even look at me.
I don't know why.
What's wrong with me?
- [Henderson] Nothing.
- Thank you.
Well, now, in Sarajevo,
everything is for sale.
I figure one day soon
even Inela herself will be for sale.
I got a packet of Marlboro...
and cake of soap
hidden away for that day.
- [Jane] Tight ass!
- I'm going... Listen to me... I'm going out to find her...
and then she will be for sale...
and I will buy her,
dang, dang, dang...
and die really, really happy.
Inela. See, every cloud
has a silver lining.
Have you seen her, this Inela?
Yeah, but I think
she's past her best.
- So is he.
- Aren't we all?
[Risto] I don't know for you. Look
at me, a little gray, but I'm still...
- [Jane] Still hot.
- [Risto Laughing] Still hot, baby. Yeah.
You're maybe further past
than most, Risto.
- It's not looking good so far, is it?
- I was a champion.
Mr. Henderson.
- Hello.
- Don't you remember me?
I remember you.
I used to work in the Holiday Inn.
- Yes, I do. Zeljko.

I've brought you something.
She wants you to sit down.
[Speaking Bosnian]
She said she knew you were coming.
It was in the beans.
Then she knows
what I've come for then.
You are here
to talk about Emira.
You have said that you will bring
her back after the war.
Yes, I know I said that,
but, uh...
things have changed
a bit since then.
The orphanage is
no longer in existence...
Mrs. Savic has gone
into hiding...
and Emira is very happy
where she is.
[Speaking Bosnian]
She wants to thank you
for all you did for Emira.
[Girl Interpreting]
Mr. Henderson...
I'm her mother...
and I'm alone.
I know that I was a bad mother.
I know that I gave her away,
but I love her.
Do you understand
why I want her back?
- Understand?
- Yes.
Da.
Yes, I understand.
[Bosnian]
But, uh...
Emira hardly knows you.
You've seen her twice in eight years,
and to be honest, I think that...
- I don't translate this.
- What?
I don't translate this.
You must listen.
No, I have been listening,
and I have things to say as well.
- Zeljko, will you translate it?
- Just wait.
I'm giving you Emira
to be your daughter.
But because I was
a bad mother...
I don't have
any memories of her.
I want to see her...
to hear her voice.
[Speaking Bosnian]
How you get money
for this car? Huh?
It's through here.
I have a videotape
of Emira in England...
if Mrs. Hodzić
would like to see it.
Would you ask her
if she wants to see this? Sit down.
- [Translating In Bosnian]
- Yeah.
[Laughing]
- Can I have some of these?
- Yeah.
[Speaking Bosnian]
[Girl Translating]
She looks happy there.

Right. In there.
Hi, it's me. Hi.
Could you put Emira on?
Hold on.
- Emira? Telephone.
- Yes. Okay.
- You okay? It's Michael.

- She wants to talk to you.
- Okay.
- [Speaking Bosnian]
- Hello?
- Emira?
- Hello? Yes?
What do you want?
Let me speak to Michael.
She cannot understand
what she's talking about.
Can she speak Bosnian?
Emira, you have
to talk in Bosnian.
