U2.
Doyou copy, U2?
U2.
Doyou read me?
''Good-bye''
It's already been six months
since Hee went into hiding.
Maybe she was taken back
due to the risk ofexposure.
- Hi!
- Hi!
I dreamt about U2 last night.
He said he'd busted Hee.
Good-bye.
You know this song?
I don't like music.
You know that, don'tyou?
September 1 998
Seoul
May I helpyou?
I was having a little chat
with my buddies.
About what?
Love.
And?
They say love's to stay together
until the last moment.
They know the pain ofseparation.
I bet they do,
seeing each other sold off.
Haveyou ever seen fishes cry?
How do they cry?
Cry in the water,
then you'll know how.
You're about the same size...
as my boyfriend.
Haveyou ever seen fishes laugh?
No.
It's already been a year.
It was raining then, too.
You came back the next day
to buy a fishbowl...
with a CD for me.
- I said, ''May I helpyou?''
- ''Anapus.''
Yeah, you said ''Anapus''
instead of''Anabus.''
''Bus!''
It was a strange feeling.
A total stranger gave me a CD
I really liked.
It was coincidental, but...
you felt so close,
as ifI'd known you for a long time.
Did you go
to alcohol cessation class today?
The doctor said
that I no longer had to come.
Take a guess.
- Ki.
- Ki?
Ki.
You're unbelievable!
They're ''Kissingurami.''
Kissingurami.
Ifone ofthem dies,
the other dies too.
They dry up from malnutrition
or their scales fall off.
Don't let them die.
Feed them once a day,
and change the water--
Every five days.
They don't survive
where it's dark and cold.
Keep the lights on all the time.
I might do the same thing
ifyou left me alone.
Kissingurami.

Any barrier?
Aroundthe thirdblock.
Take the outside!
Calm down.
I'm a secret agent.
Dead end of4th Street.
Against the wall!
Why did you run?
She was here.
She knew about our rendezvous.
Who?
- Where?
- He's down!
It's a lovelyWednesday
when our fish take a bath.
It's a lovelyWednesday

Please don't put ashes
into the fishbowl.
My goldfish smokes, too.
Dr. Min, identified
It's a lovelyWednesday
when our fish take a bath.
Hey, oddball!
Lim was the head
ofblack-market weapons dealers.
We knew nothing
about his organization.
When'd he call you?
Right before I called you.
The perpetratorwas there
at the same time.
Considering the fact
that he was at the scene...
he wasn't being followed.
Otherwise he would've been killed
before the rendezvous.
Mylife is on theline.
I'lltellyou the details later,
butit'saboutmy client...
whois ontosomething
very dangerous.
Letme tellyouagain.
Ifyoudon'tprotectme--
His life was being threatened
during the weapons deal.
Our priority is to find out
who his client was.
We went to meet him
right after the call.
The big question is...
how'd this client know
we were meeting?
Autopsyreports came out.
- What's up?
- It's Wednesday.
- Get the smell offthe bowl.
- Don't put cookies into it then.
You can't feed the fish
the same thing all the time.
From the first to the fourth
cervical vertebrae...
one bullet went through
between the third and fourth...
and the other penetrated
between right and left atrium...
which killed him instantly.
The heart was completely destroyed.
I've never seen anything
like this before.
The former coroner has.
Dr. Kim, Director Cho.
They're all the same.
She's at it again.
Good-bye.
Chodo Harbor, North Korea
For the victory!
For the victory!
No more corrupt politicians!
No more 50 years ofseparation,
disgrace and humiliation!
We're writing a new history
of Korea!
And the beginning ofit
is in your hands!
I expect to seeyou all again
under a unified sky.
Good luck.
For the unification.
For the unification.
Team 4, go!
Don't move!
He left nothing
related to his business.
No wonder.
They destroy everything
that could be used against them.
It's hard to find any connection
between Lim and Hee.
Then we're back to square one.
People around Lim?
Lim took care ofbusiness by himself.
Nobody knows anything.
Hee's been hiding out
for over a year.
I don't get it.
A weapons dealerwas her first target.
It's too easy for her.
Aren't we overreacting?
Could it be a gang war imitating her?
Nobody can imitate her.
We need to find out
what she wanted from him...
and why he contacted us.
What did Hee ask him for?
What was the information
Lim tried to give us?
Ifshe hasn't gotten
what she wanted from him yet...
she'll try to get it
through other channels.
We need to focus on the fact
that North Korea's using her again...
even though her identity
has been exposed to us.
You two are the best agents
we've got.
Finish her atyour first opportunity.
What doyou think
was their relationship?
Why'd she approach him?
I guess she needed something
from him.
That's it.
That thing she asked him to get her.
That's the key.
What'd he mean
by something dangerous?
You look awfully serious.
We're late, come on.
I got delayed at the beauty parlor.
Haveyou waited long?
Not long.
How do I look?
We'd better hurry.
Did you sleep well?
Did I snore?
I was worried about that.
Wereyou tired?
He always sleeps at the theater.
I wish you had somebody
for times like these.
You two are here.
He isn't into anything.
He doesn't even like to sing
or listen to music.
Really?
I grew up near the airport
'cause my old man was a pilot.
So I can't tell a noise
from a rhythm.
Nothing's music to my ears.
Then, what doyou like?
I like looking for people.
Lately I've been looking
for my ex-girlfriend.
What's she like?
You want to take a look?
She's cute.
Why did you break up?
So I can look for her.
Gosh, I'm sorry.
- No problem.
- Wipe it offwith this.
Here.
- I am really sorry.
- It's okay.
It's punishment for dozing off
in the theater.
Excuse me.
- When is yourwedding day?
- 20th ofnext month.
When areyou gonna tell her?
- You can't hide it forever.
- I don't wanna burden her.
What ifyou die on a mission?
- What about her?
- I can't anyway.
- Why not? You don't trust her?
- Don't be sentimental.
Let me askyou something.
If Hee and I point a gun
at each other...
and you have to choose one,
who would that be?
Hee, ofcourse.
I'd saveyour ass
'cause I can bust her later.
You don't get many chances.
You don't get many friends
you'd die for either.
It's not too late, man.
You can changeyour mind.
Cheers.
I'm all wet!
Wait till that stain gets washed off.
I've had it.
Give me money for laundry.
Ask her.
I'll pay for it
when I do that again.
- Aim well next time.
- I'll try.
- Where are all the taxis?
- Let's take the subway.
- In this rain?
- You're wet anyway.
I don't have a girl to take care ofme
ifI catch a cold.
Come on, let's run!
You sure?
It's gonna rain all night long.
I like it.
I don't think they do.
It's bedtime for them.
Looks like the rain woke them up.
- What are they saying?
- Theywant us to keep quiet.
- How areyour Kissingurami?
- They fight a lot.
One minute, they hate each other...
next minute, they're hugging,
kissing and stuff.
They're always like that.
When I go out,
I get worried about them.
IfI am not there,
you have to take care ofthem.
I don't think I can.
I can't even handle ''Kissing''
and ''Anabus'' at home.
That's whyyou have to learn more.
To live with them,
you have no choice.
Your sweater is almost done.
I hope it looks good on you.
What should I getyou
for the wedding?
All I want is...
whatever happens to me...
you love and never leave me.
That's all.
Becauseyou're the only one
who truly understands me.
Shiri, step one, on!
On the 1 7th, one million dollars
were transferred from Lim's account...
into Kim's.
Kim?
He looks most suspicious
on the transaction record.
- Who's he?
- National Defense lab researcher.
Kim speaking.
Yes. Okay.
As a part ofa new weapons system
being developed...
we launched the CTX project
lastyear.
If Kim was doing business
with the weapons dealer...
chances are very high
that it was CTX.
Tell me more about the CTX.
CTX is a new type ofenergy...
originally invented by
Korea Energy Development Lab.
We've been working on
turning it into a weapon.
At first, we had problems with
its delicate detonation conditions...
but the test we did last month
was successful.
People atyour agency
know about this too.
It'll bring a sensational change
to the military's weapons systems.
How's it different
from the conventional bombs?
It's a liquid bomb.
What's most amazing about CTX is
that it's indistinguishable from water.
When it's in a normal state,
there's neither smell nor color...
and you can't detect the liquid itself
with any devices.
Yet the effect is
ten times more powerful than...
any other bombs you've ever seen.
What ifa black-market dealer got it?
He could get the information on it,
but not the CTX itself...
becauseyou need three or four
approvals to release it.
If Mr. Kim took a bribe
to hand it over...
he would've returned the money.
Where's it made and kept?
That's confidential. Sorry.
But CTX has never been
released until today.
How areyou so sure?
When CTX is released...
it goes through three
authorization checkpoints...
and this morning
everything was in order.
You're saying it was released
this morning?
For the weapon show tomorrow...
it's being transferred
to headquarters as we speak.
Sera Mike 1,
stopatDongsanservicearea.
Will Hee turn up?
She wants the CTX.
She wouldn't miss this chance.
Why are they bothering us?
Theywant two secret agents
to ride with us.
What for?
What the hell is that?
Sir, we need to check the vehicles.
I wasn't informed ofthis.
What's going on?
We got a report ofa possible
interception ofCTX.
Your permit and I D, please.
The CTX is safe with us.
Get out ofthe way.
Didn'tyou hear me?
I asked foryour permit and I D,
didn't I?
This is Sera Mike 1 ,
we're stopped at a checkpoint.
I don't have time for this.
I'll fax it toyou.
Ifyou resist,
we'll have to arrestyou.
What did you say?
We'll have to arrestyou...
or kill you.
- Areyou nuts?
- I'm fine.
Areyou out ofyour mind?
You fucking moron!
Areyou fucking nuts?
Wait, look at this.
What base areyou from?
Democratic Peoples
Republic of Korea!
Sera Mike 1 , doyou copy?
They've been hit!
It's worse than we thought!
It's a bomb! Run!
Hee asked Lim for the CTX...
and Lim bribed the researcher
to hand it over.
But when they realized
it couldn't be done...
they planned to intercept it
on the road.
In the process,
Lim and Kim were murdered...
along with 20 ofour armed guards.
How much CTXwas taken?
About a gallon.
It is enough to blow up
an entire city.
Any leads on the interceptors?
Notyet, sir.
Just an assumption
that they're involved with Hee.
But whywould North Korea do that...
in a time ofreconciliation?
We haven't seen the hidden camera
mounted on the vehicle...
but the gunfire at the scene
makes me think...
that they're highly trained
North Korean militants.
Their military system
is falling fast.
It could be a private organization
wanting the CTX for their own purpose.
The question is, what are they
planning to do with the CTX?
Ifit blows up in Seoul,
we're finished.
Why not make an official statement
to the North Korean government?
Not until we have solid proof.
We also need to figure out
why their target was the CTX.
As you all know,
it may explode without the detonator.
And no devices can detect
the liquid itself.
Ifthey utilize those traits,
expect the worst.
There's no way to predict when,
where or how it's gonna go off.
- Dinner?
- I don't feel like it.
Is the meeting over?
- Little while ago.
- Anything special?
Ready to order?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Beer, please.
- Okay.
What about the scene?
An inspection ofthe scene
was delayed...
and the bodies werejust taken
to the headquarters.
The film will be handed over
tomorrow.
Any leads?
Just bodies and shells.
Isn't it strange?
Anything else?
This is the third time.
Lim, Kim.
This time CTXwas intercepted.
We went to see Lim
right after the call...
and to the lab right after
we got the report.
We're always a step behind.
It's like theywere
reading our moves.
There's a leak.
It's impossible unless someone inside
leaked the information.
Don'tjump to conclusions.
Todaywe went to the lab
without notice.
Kim didn't even know
that we were coming...
and he got killed
five minutes before we got there.
Ifthat's the case,
it's obvious.
Only Director Ko and I knew
about those killings and the CTX.
And you made the report.
Shiri 1 's on line.
It's been a long time.
At 09:00.
With sunglasses on.
You've changed a lot.
It's been sixyears.
- How's my family?
- They're fine.
I miss them.
Completion is near.
You'll meet them soon.
A barrier is in the way.
Get rid ofit.
Target?
Kissingurami.
Finish thejob
before the completion.
Acknowledged.
For the unification.
For the unification.
We'realwaysastepbehind.
They were readingourmoves.
There'saleak.
It's impossible unlesssomeoneinside

- Hello?
- It'sme, Ho.
- Can I seeyou tomorrow?
-Sure. What'sgoingon?
I have a favor to ask.
Callmeat thepoliceagencytomorrow.
- Okay.
- Seeyou tomorrow.
I'll call you.
What areyou doing there?
You scared me!
- Youjust got here?
- No, earlier.
I cleaned and did the laundry.
Nothing was in the refrigerator.
We ran out ofcoffee...
so I went grocery shopping.
What's wrong?
You don't look so good.
Just busy at work.
Why didn'tyou call?
I was gonna leave soon.
Dinner?
Notyet.
I had a late lunch.
Let me fix dinner for us.
- What are we having?
- Your favorite.
- You wanna take a shower?
- After dinner.
- I think it's done.
- Let it simmer.
Can you hand me the clothespins
and hangers from the sofa?
- I couldn't find the pins.
- It's okay.
Leave it, I'll do it.
When areyou moving in?
Soon, I guess.
I haven't packed upyet.
- Let me helpyou pack up.
- Okay.
With you here,
it won't be as lonely.
You hated eating alone
and waking up byyourself.
You'll whisper in my ear
to wake me up from now on.
I'll make the coffee,
and you'll play soft music.
Should we buy birds?
You'd like birds singing
in the morning.
Promise me...
thatyou keep the promise
you made to me a year ago.
Trust me.
I'll never drink again.
Because I haveyou.
Thesoccerteam of

The North Korea PresidentLee

When it's in a normal state,
there's neither smell nor color.
When it's in a normal state,
there's neither smell nor color.
You can't tell the difference
from waterwith the naked eye.
But it's a different story
with the light on. Turn it on.
It's on.
CTX responds to daylight...
over 6,000 kelvin.
The light alone may start
its reaction.
But without heat, it's no good.
Fire.
What?
Yes, sir.
It's on, sir.
Ifyou expose it to both
light and heat...
nitro-alpha inside the sphere
and beta outside react differently.
But when the liquid in the sphere
becomes red, the sphere pops.
Nitro-alpha and beta combined
causes the explosion.
How much power does it have?
This is about 200 cc, so...
everything within the radius
ofone kilometerwould disappear.
Since the detonation varies
depending on the reaction...
the sensor here tells you
when it's exploding.
Like now, ifthe sphere
becomes red...
it means the explosion
is imminent.
Ifyou don't stop it
before the sphere pops...
it explodes.
But with either light or heat removed,
the reaction stops.
I've never seen an agent likeyou
in 20 years.
You're an oddball.
I am not, sir.
- Admit it.
- No, I am not.
Admit it!
Then I wouldn't be cleaning
the fishbowls.
AgentRyu, come toroom 17.
I gotta go.
Find the CTX as soon as possible
so we can go drinking.
We'll find it!
Anyone recognize him?
Don'tyou remember, Ryu?
His name is Park.
A top agent for the North Korean
8th special forces.
When Ryu stormed the plane
that'd been hijacked...
he was the only one
that escaped from the plane.
A painful memory for Ryu.
Clear!
HeeandPark.
All the pieces are coming together.
Agent Lee? Find out what's going on
with 8th special forces.
And you get the daily data of
spy satellites from National Defense.
- Agent Yoon!
- Yes, sir.
Post Park's montage
throughout the country.
They're 8th special forces.
It's worse than we expected.
The 8th special forces
intercepted the CTX. Why?
The 8th special forces
intercepted the CTX. Why?
Three possibilities here.
First, to sell it off
to a third country.
Second, to use it
on the negotiation table...
for money or to seek asylum
to another country.
Third, a strategy they are known for...
they say theywant peace
and stab us in the back.
It must be either for the money
or an explosion.
Iftheywanted the money, why CTX?
Robbing the Bank of Korea
would be much easier.
Whywould they spoil the peace
conference by using the bomb?
That's difficult to answer.
Hee is the key to all this.
We don't have time.
We'll find a way.
What doyou see?
Can't even tell me?
Maybe the solution
is much closer than we think.
- What doyou mean?
- Hee could be close by.
Hey, you!
- What the hell areyou doing here?
- I am looking for the men's room.
Areyou fucking blind?
Didn't see the sign ''Restricted Area''?
Hey, you hear me?
I sure did.
Watch your mouth.
Take care.
- How haveyou been?
- Bored to death.
I feel more insecure
when it's so quiet.
I need some backup.
What aboutyour agency?
- The air isn't very clear there.
- What doyou mean?
I think there's a leak.
This is the onlyway.
- It must be very stressful.
- It'll get better.
- When doyou need it?
- Tomorrow.
- I'm coming too.
- Sorry, no married men.
- Time and place?
- I'll call you.
All right, then.
Ho!
We'll talk later.
How's your friend?
- He'll live.
- I am glad to hear that. Have a seat.
Who else knew
you two were meeting?
It was very personal.
I didn't tell anybody.
Lim, Kim, Ho.
Hee is very nearby.
There must be a leak.
Nobody knows that for sure.
Internal Affairs is on it.
You don't trustyour men?
Doyou trust me?
Traps could be anywhere.
Maybe there's a hole
in the security system...
but that possibility
is almost zero.
Don't share the information
with anybody.
Not even with your partner, Lee.
Traps underyour feet
are hard to see.
I'm the director in charge.
I'm Park ofthe 8th specialforces.
I want to talk tomyoldfriend.
Thanks for calling me, friend.
I was gonna send you a coffin,
butyou were lucky.
Disappointed with Hee's shooting?
Save it.
We can takeyou out anytime.
Maybe I'll takeyououtfirst.
So, you've become a man.
You know where I am?
Young drunk kids here
yelling on the street...
while people in the north
are starving to death.
People here have wastes
building up in their bellies.
What an unfairworld.
Listen, friend.
We have ten CTXs placed
all over Seoul.
I'll call you 30 minutes
before each ofthem goes off.
You'dbetterfindthem
beforepeoplegethurt.
What doyou want?
Slowdown, friend.
The firstoneis on theroof
ofthe Golden Tower.
Youhave exactly30minutes.
Youknowthe fishnamed ''shiri''?
It'sa Koreanaboriginalfish,
living in crystalstreams.
Though they'reseparated
with the country divided...
someday they'llreunite
in thesamestreams.
ShouldIbuysome
foryourgirlfriend's fishshop?
Why not?
Stay alive until then.
He's on the move.
Clear!
Found it!
Hyun?
Don't tell anybodyyou're here.
Page me ifnecessary,
and never use the phone here.
I checked you in under an alias.
Don't go out.
I'll take care ofthe shop.
What's going on?
Don't ask.
Please do as I say.
I don't wanna stay here.
Hyun!
You haven't touched a drop
for a year.
This is me.
You know that, don'tyou?
What is it?
What?
You wanna know what?
Tell me what's wrong.
Dearpeople oftheSouth...
todaymarksanimportant
andjoyousmomentin ourhistory.
Iam here toputan endtoyears
ofconfrontationanddissension...
andto open upanewera
ofunderstanding.
You got a call.
Hello?
A guywho knows everything
about the CTX contacted me.
He's Hee's informant,
and he wants a deal.
Whereareyou?
I'm meeting him at
the Hwain Cultural Center.
I'm on myway.
Be there.
On my way.
He's wearing a blackjacket
and a black cap.
Anything else?
- That'sall.
- I'll be right there.
You look good in a blackjacket.
Anyone else coming?
Hee, maybe.
Soyou called me expecting someone
inside to leak the information?
I hope it worked.
Nobody at the agency
knows that I'm here.
You know it's impossible
to tap the phones.
So, ifthey show up...
I'm the rat?
The MSG-90 Hee uses
is a five-shot semiautomatic.
She used only two bullets,
both for Lim and Ho.
In both cases,
you were in her range.
IfI were her...
I would have used
the other three bullets.
Three targets wentinside.
Acknowledged.
Stay in position.
The mole must have been found.
For the unification!
- Been a long time.
- Good to seeyou.
Payback time for flight 257.
Lookwho's talking.
You killed seven ofmy men.
You leftyour men behind.
'Cause I have ajob to finish.
You wanna know what it is?
I'll ask Hee.
It's my turn to send you a coffin.
Won't be easy!
Get back!
She usedonlytwobullets.
Inboth cases,
you were inherrange.
IfI wereher...
I wouldhave used
the otherthreebullets.
Name: Hyun
Residency: Cheju Island
Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome
Admitted at Halla Hospital
Get me Halla Hospital
in Cheju Island.
Why'd you come here?
They ambushed us.
OP set a trap.
Becauseyou didn't follow orders
to kill Ryu.
Ifthis is for my failure,
I'll take the consequences.
Killing him.
It was my personal order.
When I metyou here,
I saw the confusion in you.
Thanks toyou...
we lost two ofour men!
I did what I could do.
Yeah, you saved my life.
What doyou want?
You've changed.
Ofcourse I have...
from Hee to Hyun.
Not only in appearance,
but inside as well!
I don't need a betrayer.
We've waited ten years
for this moment.
In those hours ofpain,
we pledged allegiance...
and buried ouryouth
in the tomb ofhistory.
Ifyou want to turn your back on us
over personal feelings, finish it here.
I was stupid...
thinking I could be Hyun.
But I am just Hee
who has to kill her man.
I failed to change my inside.
Let go!
We have ajob to finish.
Avoid any physical contact with her,
and no smoking...
because her immune system
has dropped.
And make it quick.
There she is,
with theyellow sweater.
Doyou mind ifI sit here?
Sure.
Areyou from
the public health center?
I am looking for this girl.
Anything happen to her?
She's my old friend.
I need to find her.
She rented a room in our house...
twoyears ago...
and she'd visit me here
quite often.
She was very nice to me...
as ifshe were my real sister.
She said she'd call me
fromJapan, but...
I think she misplaced my number.
Otherwise she'd have called.
She went toJapan?
She said it was for plastic surgery
to remove a scar on her body.
The day she left,
I cried my eyes out.
She hugged me...
and went on about
how sorry she was.
I didn't even know...
what she was sorry about.

Two ofthem died today.
I am not a fish shop boy.
I'm an OP agent, too.
You know how many fishbowls
we've got here?
I don't wanna deal with

It's the cookies that killed it.

Ifthis is formy failure,
I'll take the consequences.

Going to a soccer game?
I had four goldfish on my desk...
I had four goldfish on my desk...
and two ofthem died today.
At first I thought it was
the cookies that killed them.
But I was wrong.
''SU300'' inside their bodies...
is a high-tech bug
that can be used underwater.
I suspected my partner
these last few days, including you.
I planted some bugs here...
and got the information
that I didn't want to get.
From October 1 996 to August 1 997...
when Hee disappeared,
you were inJapan.
You didn't need a fake passport
coming back in...
becauseyou became Hyun.
Ryu went to Cheju Island
to find the truth.
What makes me sad
is that my buddy...
Ryu...
loved you with all his heart.
Let me askyou this.
Did you really love him?
Over here!
I planted a bug in your car.
Will you forgive me?
Staywith me!
The ambulance is on the way!
I messed up.
You're going to be okay.
You've always been the best!
This won't kill me.
- This won't--
- Staywith me!
The 747's here.

northwest from terminal two.
Snipers, make an entry through

Their target is the soccer game.
They're on theirway
to the stadium.
Whatareyou talkingabout?
No time to explain.
The stadium is at stake!
They've set CTX around Seoul
and want ten million dollars.
- They werebluffing.
- Why the stadium?
All the North Korean leaders
are gathered there.
Whywould they do that?
How the hell do I know?
Call offthe game immediately
and evacuate all the spectators.
Areyououtofyourmind?
Calloffthegame?
Imagine a CTX going off
at the stadium!
Go back to headquarters.
Don't worry about the stadium.
Not even a drop ofwater
can pass through security.
- It won't work.

Hey, friend!
You finally made it here.
Where's your backup?
All at the airport?

Hello, Dr. Min?
It's me, Sik.
Can'tyou hear me?
It's me, the oddball!
I have a question about the CTX.
The CTX!
What did you saywere
the conditions for self-detonation?
This will be the graveyard
for the corrupt politicians.
Not only the politicians,
but also innocent people.
This is crazy!
Sometimes history needs
craziness to help it.
What doyou want?
A war!
We're removing
the barriers for a war.
These people
are notyour barriers.
When we're done here...
our people's revolutionary army
will start a war.
It's not too late.
Turn the lights offnow!
That's not what
the people ofthis land want.
They don't want anotherwar
to kill each other!
Revolution always comes with pain.
Sacrifices are necessary.
There were people who thought
the same as you in 1 950.
Remember the pain that
the war caused in this country?
I rememberverywell.
What pain the war
and separation left us.
I'm putting an end to it.
This game is to ease that pain!
I know it can.
We've waited for 50 years
under those politicians...
but unfortunately,
they don't want reunification.
It's like we're watching
a well-written play.
Don't be mistaken.
You're not the only one
who wants reunification.
We have to wait
for the right moment.
''Our hope is reunification.
We dream about it.''
When you sing this song...
our people in the North...
are dying on the street.
They barely manage to live
with roots and barks.
Our sons and daughters...
are being sold off...
for fucking 1 00 dollars!
Haveyou ever seen parents eating...
the flesh oftheir dead kids?
With cheese, Coke and hamburgers...
you wouldn't know.
A soccer game to unite the nations?
It's bullshit.
We've had enough with
the 50 years ofdeception.
We're opening up...
a new history of Korea.
Four minutes to go.
Four minutes to go.
The CTXwill detonate soon.
Historywill judge us.
You know what?
The pain you suffered
for the last 50 years...
came from one person's
misjudgment.
Stop!
Lights offin section 3-G?
Turn them off!.
Right now!
Don't wasteyour time.
Nobody's turning them off.
Turn them off!.
We're dying together here.
Pull the trigger.
Now!
Good thing I have company
on myway to hell.
Turn the lights off?
You know where Hee is?
She's in the audience...
laughing atyou.
Youknow where Heeis?
She's in theaudience,
laughingatyou.
O2, this is O3.
O2, this is O3.
Presidential guards, respond!
Evacuate the president!
Gate52, he's onhis way

Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning

I am not an oddball.
Three. Oddballs chicken out!
When'd you first meet her?
March, lastyear.
Give me the details.
The next day I went to see her.
I gave her a CD...
and we had dinner together.
We talked about music.
Didn'tyou ever feel
she was approaching you?
Then I wouldn't be here.
How were all the fishbowls
brought in here?
She wanted to put a few
in my office for decoration.
The agency bought
the rest through me.
She was pregnant.
Did you know that?
She never told me.
How come?
She could have used it
to blindfold you.
According to our report,
you were getting married soon.
You didn't suspect her at all
dating for a wholeyear?
What doyou want me to say?
Answer the question.
We don't trust anybody...
not even the fellow agents
you share life with.
But she was an exception.
It means you admit that
you neglected your duty?
It's not likeyou.
Agent Ryu is dead.
When was the first time
you met Hee?
It was Hyun, not Hee.
Let's call her Hee.
You know Hydra?
She's a goddess with six heads
in Greek mythology.
She has multiple personalities
with one body.
Hyun and Hee...
they're totally different.
Hydra ofour times--
The reality ofa separate Korea
turned her into Hydra.
This is Pager Voice Mail.

Did you meet her?
No.
It would have been nicer
ifyou came with her.
What is this?
They're Kissingurami.
For me?
They're beautiful.
Thanks a lot.
Ifone ofthem dies...
the other dies, too.
They dry up from loneliness, right?
Don't be surprised.
She knew everything about fish.
In fact...
she stayed over here
quite a few times.
You know how bad she is
when she sleeps?
I found her under the bed
every morning.
And when eating...
you have to be alert.
She's so bad with chopsticks
that she throws food on you.
Listen to this song.
It was her favorite.
