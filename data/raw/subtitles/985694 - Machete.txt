We're federal agents, we are not martyrs!
This is suicide!
She is just one of many
Abduction.
What makes it so special?
Because it is a witness against
The Torrez?
He probably caught it,
and drugged-up to the tips of hair.
We do not have to do this!
If not us...
... Who?
I told you to stay still!
And do not try to capture the Torrez!
Turn around now!
Machete, you son of a bitch!
Do not listen to orders!
You'll eventually kill us all!
Waiting for reinforcements!
Whatever happens...
I'm with you...
... Boss.
Sorry.
I told you to stay quiet asshole.
If you had listened to my orders
you would not have been caught.
This is what happens when they insist
to be heroes.
Burn it!
You work today
and pay me tomorrow.
You need a gardener?
Come on. Stand back.
Hurry!
We have not got.
You can not leave us here!
She is crazy.
Hey ugly!
Want to fight?
Do not tell me that you let escape
$ 500 for five minutes.
Most do not give illegal
standard treatment in hospitals.
But thou art with us.
Still nobody knows you're here.
You were brought here under the name John Doe,
as a mere spectator.
Yes, hold the illegals!
Close the border!
Well, we're almost there.
If the close, fine by me.
"Cona" Opinions should be like.
This is the boss.

Got tomatoes
Just as I like...
What is that large and hard?
My Machete.
You keen?

How about you say?
Excellent... Excellent...
Why are you so insistent?
Paid to all forces

I have the DEA and the federal...
Why do not you? You could take
my money and look elsewhere
What is your price?
Let me ask your wife.
Bring it.
Your daughter is now in school, no?

 Thanks, it's a pleasure to be here. &lt;/ i&gt;
What gives  steps to secure the border &lt;/ i&gt;
 ICE has many
Officers patrolling the border. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 But they are almost two thousand miles
border between the U. S. and Mexico, &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 and over half are in Texas. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 Therefore, we need to attack
the problem at its source. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 There is a support network, not
only helps illegal immigrants get &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 but helps them to establish themselves
once they are here. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 need to figure out this network. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 is the top priority for our
Agency to investigate this problem. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;

 destroying it from within. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 But state Sen. John McLaughling
has a plan of attack &lt;/ i&gt;
 He will fight to keep

 He advocates a fence electrified. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;

we see
 In the race for State Senate... &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 the latest research shows that
McLaughlin declined in voting intentions &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 due to its tough stance
on immigration. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;

His words.
Yes, he will send to you and to all
his brothers back to Mexico.
As a courtesy
rather than build a
border wall without pay
and then, thank you.
Get out
But what the senator does not understand
is that this state walk
based on the illegal.
What drives.
Keep costs low.
Keeping the wheels in motion.
They are fucked

Making people suffer on both sides.
The Senator Must Die
So I will give you

Because if we tested
tested with fire...
 our borders are put to the test
Let me tell you, we speak of this test to the test. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 foreigners
the invaders, the outsiders &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 come to our land crossing
the border day and night. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
Are parasites
These suck-bloods are degrading
our cities, counties, states.
Please understand. We are at war
Every time an illegal
crossing our borders
is an act of aggression against
sovereignty of our State
is an act of terrorism
In all sides people
talk about change...
"Change what?" This is a great
state, but founded on freedom.
Do not want to change that.
Our citizens E. U. A.
They work hard to earn a salary.
Do not want to change that.
Changes, a lot of changes...
Open the doors, "Red Rover, Red Rover
want the terrorists to come. "
Let me say that will change...
$ 68 cents.
The coins in your pocket
because that is what the parasites
take out your money.
But that may change
I want to say one more thing...

 Senator McLaughlin was injured in a
leg by an unknown gunman. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
He was immediately transported 
for the Park Lane Hospital, &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 where, according to reports its
condition is good and stable &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 a video shows the gunman
was a man of Mexican origin. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;

For money?
Why did you?
For money?
Look, you Machete

And this?
These are the types

Machete not send messages
But can Machete evidence.
Thanks for returning
 There is no way that McLaughlin
is elected, unless something big happens. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 you imagine if someone shoots the senator,
and that someone turns out to be the Mexican &lt;/ i&gt;
 not want to see
elected as President &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 is not a sin if someone shoots
the loss of Senator, right? &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
So, here is a recording

We will be re-elected Senator and
built around the border
before it is too late.
Really hate us so much?
No priest, I hate
profits are low.
An open border allows a flow
easily supply
declining prices.
The border security, we limit
supplies, raise prices.
Higher price, higher profits.
You are blinded by power, including even
an attack against his own boss
only to improve
numbers of elections.
Last chance, buddy.
Where's Machete
My wife and daughter?
What the hell?
Salute then.
A true gentleman.

Thus Booth, I'm in your city.
And I will kill Machete
And you will see how it goes
And you will be the last you see
Waiting
There's a girl in ICE
Is with Machete and has evidence against
me against you, against McLaughlin, everyone.
You can do things
very difficult for us.
Where is  &lt;/ i&gt;
You know, I thought...
We let these people in our homes between
take care of our children,
park our cars...
But do not let enter the country.
It makes sense to you?
You remember that one
I did it on the head.
And also gave me a shot in the leg.
I thought the Jango
had shot
I do not want to hear this story.
Think about it.
He was not here for us
been here by the head.
But looking at the head, this
type is a real mouse.
You better shut up yourself
Where is your loyalty?
Did you hear that?
It's the machine.
He's back. Divide into.
Alfa unit, you hear?
Skirt!
Can anybody hear me?
Anyone?

Do not kill me, please, take it.
In Spanish, "I leave you vivir. "
Thanks Chief
 Let me get this right. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 One of the most prominent business men
Watchers of Texas &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 the best known drug trafficker in Mexico
and a senator from the state, all &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 are conspiring to have
stricter laws on immigration &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
I know how that sounds, but I have to Booth
a video to commit a murder
I have a lot of confessions.
. Listen, this man is an immigrant
illegal, an illegal immigrant is against the law. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
For it is the law and what is right
I will do what is right
 come from the Church of Hope
where there is little time &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 that police discovered a brutal murder. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 The body of a priest
was found crucified. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 And according to the descriptions
witnesses, &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
 coincides with the man they were looking
about the shooting of Senator McLaughlin. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
Ladies, ladies, please close the
doors. Give us a break.
 On the street, call him Machete. &lt;/ i&gt;
 Who wants to be caught... &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;
What the hell have you doing?
This type is burning
the city to the ground.

But for Torres was not enough.
Thinks, why do not the politicians

It's time to cross the line, and
