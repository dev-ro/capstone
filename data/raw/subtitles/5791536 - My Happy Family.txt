I need today's advertising paper.
Could I have one, please?
Here.
Thank you.
-Will they fix the elevator?
-Of course they will.
I'm not a liar.
I didn't mean it that way.
So many people live here, my dear.
Not everyone will take the stairs.
There's even
a high-up official living here.
It's been disconnected. Never mind.
The bill must be due.
I'll pay it before you move in,
so they will reconnect the power.
It's been empty for two months,
but it was always rented out before that.
The balcony is the highlight
of the apartment.
It's very sunny here.
If the sun's too hot, you can open
a parasol, so no problem there.
Come and see here, too.
Then make up your mind.
See how dirty it is?
I couldn't find anyone
to clean all this mess.
Just so you know,
the last tenants were very happy.
Even happier when they moved on
to a better house and better things.
It's that kind of apartment.
It brings luck.
Do you believe in luck? I do.
-Is this the kitchen?
-The kitchen is here.
Here's the bathroom.
The bathroom and the toilet.
I'll show it to you now, my dear.
See, everything's in order.
Come and look here.
Do you like it?
There's nothing bad about this apartment.
Here's the second balcony.
You can't find this design
anywhere else, not at this price.
It's not expensive. No one else
would let it for this price.
Do you have a family?
What's this, Manana?
-I cook dinner and you're eating cake?
-I don't want dinner.
You could have your dinner
and eat dessert afterwards.
You always do this, always.
Just look at this.
-Why's it here?
-Leave it alone.
And he says I should leave it alone.
We've been bending over backwards
to pay for his lessons.
We spend so much money on his whims.
I don't believe
he'll ever give up on his computer.
Why do you stand here
staring at these children?
Leave them alone, they're young.
Go and eat your meal.
They can go elsewhere, can't they?
They can't help it, Otar.
They love each other.
You'd better watch it, Lasha.
Sweet mercy...
By the way, Lamara...
you and Otar
should follow their example.
Soso and Manana, you too.
It's never too late.
Shut up and stop moaning.
If you had the guts, you'd find someone.
What guts? He either
sleeps all day or sits at the computer.
What are you talking about?
Manana!
We're waiting for you.
-Do you want some?
-Yes.
-Good morning.
-Hello.
-It's Manana's birthday today.
-I know.
I'm glad you know.
Everyone forgets everything here,
except me.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Move that glass, please. Here we go.
Manana, do you see this mess?
Why can't I get the boy to stop eating
straight from the fridge?
He eats cherries with a spoon
and leaves stains everywhere.
I can't stand it, I clean it every day,
the same thing every day.
He won't listen.
How are things going?
Have you finished everything?
Finished?
She didn't sleep a wink all night.
Happy is the family
with a peaceful mother
where she sacrifices herself
for her family,
raises children...
Vakho, I'll go in with you
quickly to take my clothes.
I don't want to wake Nino.
Vakho, please, don't make any noise.
Where's my jacket?
Are you ready?
Go to the market after work.
Buy me some dill and new potatoes,
also some cheese for Khachapuri.
And a chicken, too.
I'll roast it this evening.
Soso will bring wine.
Mother, I'm not going to celebrate
my birthday or invite anyone.
I'm in no mood to see anyone.
But...
If people come,
should I meet them empty-handed?
You really amaze me.
Rezo will come,
and Bela too, with their children.
-Just one Khachapuri.
-Not now, we're late.
-You're going to buy wine?
-Of course. Shouldn't I?
I am not in the mood
to celebrate my birthday.
Don't celebrate then.
-People will still come.
-What people?
I don't know...
Your brother may come.
Bela might come with her children.
People will come, you know.
Please, don't buy wine.
If we have nothing...
they'll just come and talk a bit.
If you lay out a feast,
they won't leave till morning.
If they come,
we can't take them to an empty table.
You talk like Lamara.
I didn't invite anyone.
Why must we have a feast?
What have I done, that
I can't spend my birthday as I wish?
Do what you want, no one's stopping you.
Is The Martyrdom of Shushanik
a family drama?
From a present day perspective, it is.
However, it can be said that in this work,
 the conflict is based on religion,
exceeding the bounds of family drama.
We'll continue this next lesson.
You should write
an essay on Prince Varsken,
using the instructions
on the blackboard.
-Ok, teacher, bye.
-Goodbye.
Wait for me.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
Has anyone seen Chigogidze?
-She skipped her other classes.
-She's missed too many classes.
I can't give her a grade this semester.
-I'll tell her if I see her. Bye.
-Bye.
Hang on a minute.
-Happy birthday, have a good one.
-Thank you.
If I don't put this chicken
in the oven now,
God knows when I'll roast it. Get out.
Get out now.
-Someone's here?
-Yes, that's why I'm in a hurry.
-I wish you'd come earlier.
-Hang on.
I wanted to ask you something.
Can you take your clothes
from my room the night before?
The wardrobe is so noisy,
I can't get back to sleep.
-Ok.
-What's this?
I asked you for dill, not fennel.
I'm talking to you.
Can't you tell dill from fennel?
-I don't know, Mother.
-I asked for dill.
-Happy birthday, Mom.
-Who's here?
Soso's doctors.
Also Samkharadze senior and junior.
I don't have a present.
When I start working,
I'll buy you whatever you want.
I'm hungry. Will dinner be ready soon?
I hope you provide for your family,
if someone ever marries you.
-She can live without your present.
-She's been grumbling all day.
You sit at the computer all day.
As soon as he gets up, he rushes to it.
-Am I hurting anyone?
-Yes, yourself.
Use a glass. And put it back where it was.
There are stains all around the fridge.
What do you want? Don't stress us, please.
-Careful.
-You be careful.
Get a hair cut, boy,
you can't see a thing.
You're here.
-They're waiting for you.
-For me?
Who else? Whose birthday is it?
Lamara, please rinse this.
They are for you.
-Thank you.
-Look where he hid it.
-Doesn't it need water?
-Come.
-Me?
-Of course.
I can't.
They're asking for you.
Don't drive me crazy.
Lamara will take care of this.
-Come.
-Please, I can't.
-Here's the birthday girl.
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you, how are you?
-Happy birthday.
How could I ever live without you?
Or how could I spend my life?
Because it is so difficult
to live without you
I came to you and you took over my mind
Took over my mind
You blew my mind
And if I can wait
Nino will open it. Where are you going?
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday.
Look who's here. My darlings!
How are you?
How are things with you? How are you?
My dears.
Rezo, where were you?
I got tired of waiting for you.
Look who's here.
My angel, let's go and see
the singing men.
Look who's here.
-They are for you.
-You shouldn't have.
-It was a pleasure.
-How are you and the children?
Who's there? There are so many people.
Don't tell anyone, OK?
I said I'd come to you
I'd always come to you
There was a time when
You could hear my heartbeat
Let's go, they're tired.
-I'm not tired.
-Keso.
-They have school tomorrow.
-Bela, leave me alone, please.
-Rezo. It's late.
-Ok, let's go.
Just a minute.
Have you finished drinking here?
Goga, pour me one, please.
David, don't stop for a moment.
I want to drink to my sister.
A wonderful, most beautiful
and kind person.
I don't know anyone like her...
Who she was, is and will be...
What else can I say?
Cheers to our Manana.
Please, join us for a minute,
just this once.
Are you so unhappy to see them?
They're really good guys.
Just come for 15 minutes, sit with me.
That's all, nothing more.
They won't spend the night here.
How many times do I have to ask?
-Soso, where are you?
-I'm coming.
Come, at least for Rezo. For your brother.
I swear on the life of Lasha and Nino.
In an hour I'll send them all away,
no one will be here.
Just come in, sit there
for 15 minutes and then go.
-Good.
-What?
Nothing. They're calling you, go.
What's the matter with you?
You finally came in. Bravo.
Couldn't you have come
five minutes earlier?
The chicken was so delicious.
There was enough for you.
-And we wouldn't have felt ashamed.
-There's no chicken left? I'm hungry.
Hungry? Weren't you here?
Why didn't you eat?
-Did Nino and Vakho go to bed?
-Yes.
I'm wondering...
My friends who were here...
What will they think of me now?
They came to show
their respect for you, sang songs.
You let them leave without saying goodbye.
-Do you think that's OK?
-I didn't invite those people.
Whoever invited them should host them.
Oh, really?
Who do you think was a guest?
Was your brother a guest?
Was Rezo alone?
You invited 20 people when I said not to.
20 people? You exaggerate.
Rezo will understand that
I was in no mood for a feast.
Why weren't you?
What happened? Did someone die?
It's your birthday. Cheer up a bit.
It's no longer her birthday.
It's past midnight.
That's not the point.
Look how he's talking to me.
-He wants to make me nervous.
-Come on, Lamara.
-Don't get nervous then.
-Do you think it's that easy?
Can't you see,
you make problems out of nothing?
How do you do it? Do you enjoy it?
I can't live here.
I want to leave this house.
It seems we are really bad, nasty guys.
-Soso, please, stop it.
-Wait a minute.
We are so nasty
that she's forced to leave.
-Why does she threaten us?
-Come on, Soso, my dear.
Leave her alone.
Leave her.
You know where she gets it from.
I could never understand my husband,
what makes him happy or unhappy.
You can't understand it.
-Goodbye, teacher.
-Goodbye.
Goodbye. Chigogidze?
Yes?
Come here a minute.
Why have you missed so many classes?
Please tell me.
I had problems, teacher.
What problems
can a 17-year old girl have
that make her miss school for a month?
Were you ill?
Tell me.
-I divorced my husband, teacher.
-Divorced?
When did you get married?
Last semester.
Wait.
Sit down.
Come.
How are you now?
Fine.
Did something happen?
Why did you divorce him?
We just didn't understand each other.
We're very different.
It just didn't work out.
How old is he?
His birthday was the day
before yesterday. He's 21.
Did you live alone or with someone else?
At first, we lived with his mother.
Then we rented an apartment.
But it still didn't work out.
If I wanted something, he didn't want it.
If he wanted something, I didn't want it.
I told him that it wouldn't work out,
and I left him.
What did he say?
Just one thing, teacher.
If you say no, you should mean it.
You shouldn't look like you're hesitating.
Otherwise, it makes no sense.
Many girls tell their sweethearts
that they're leaving.
But they get back together.
If you say it once, you should do it.
That's my opinion.
Do you agree with me?
Yes.
Good.
We've covered this material in class.
Review it and prepare for the test.
Don't miss classes, OK?
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Is this dill or fennel?
Can't you see it isn't fennel?
It's dill. Real dill.
I was only asking.
Could I have a bag, please?
How much are the cucumbers?
Where are they from, Lagodekhi?
Give me one kilo.
-I need tomatoes, too.
-Sorry.
You're not taking it?
Mom, has someone hurt you?
No.
Father, can you explain?
We want to know what's going on.
Don't hold out on us.
Tell us if someone hurt you.
If you want to leave for a bit
or if you have some work,
or you need a break...
-I'm not leaving for a bit.
-You can tell us.
I'm leaving for good, I told you already.
Did you really rent an apartment?
You're going to live alone
in a rented apartment?
I can't understand
why she doesn't like it here.
Mom, please, tell us who hurt you.
-Soso, was it you?
-Leave me alone, boy.
Did you hurt her?
-Why would I hurt her?
-I don't know...
Was it me who hurt you?
No, it's nothing to do with you.
But what's up?
Why won't you tell us anything?
Mom, I asked you a question.
Maybe she doesn't want to answer.
Let her keep it private.
It's utterly incredible
how he manages to stay so calm.
She moves out of the house,
leaving her family,
and he says, "Let her keep it private."
He drives me nuts.
I can't stand it.
Ok, you don't respect your parents,
you don't respect your children.
At least tell your husband why
you're leaving and where you're going.
Shouldn't we know why?
I told you I rented an apartment.
It's in Varketili.
And I'm moving there today.
I don't want to live with you.
They're adults now
and can look after themselves.
-Well done.
-What should we tell people?
Should we say our parents divorced?
Nino, wake up. How old are you?
Worry about your own family, not about us.
Lasha, go and call Rezo.
Is Rezo my judge or superior?
Better he deal with his own family.
-Call him.
-He can't tell me what to do.
She made Rezo my judge.
I'm a grown woman, stop giving me lessons.
Call Rezo now.
Do you think I'll get scared if he comes?
Wait. I want to tell you something.
I'm just wondering...
Tell me why you're going, and where.
I don't have to explain it to you.
I'll explain to Soso.
-Now leave me alone.
-Explain what to Soso?
That you're leaving him and the children?
-Leaving him with your parents?
-It's not my problem.
If he wants to go, he's free to go.
Am I stopping him?
-I'll go.
-See, he can look after himself.
I'll find a place to go.
What don't you like about him?
Please tell me.
What's wrong with him?
He's not a drunkard. He doesn't drink.
If he drinks, he does so in moderation.
Come off it, Mother.
He isn't a thief or robber.
He isn't a criminal or drug addict.
What else do you want?
He loves his children.
He's never raised a hand against you.
You should see what other husbands do.
-I don't care about other husbands.
-Why should you?
You had everything handed to you.
You don't appreciate anything.
You had everything ahead of you.
You got married, got an education, a job.
You lived your life undisturbed.
You gave birth.
You did no housework.
You didn't raise your kids.
I did. I've been your servant
all your life.
Did I ask you to be my servant?
-Did I?
-Stop, people.
Leave me alone, Mother.
You should've seen
what kind of a husband your father was.
-You have no idea.
-Leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.
-We raised you and Rezo in hardship.
-Leave me alone.
I can't.
I won't let you go.
You aren't going anywhere.
I will, you can't keep me.
Please, let her go.
Leave her alone.
Please, leave her alone.
We'll talk to her later.
-You shouldn't interfere.
-Stop it, don't shout.
What's up with you?
You disgrace your husband,
your parents and children.
You disgrace all of us.
You disgrace us
in front of our neighbors. Let me go.
-Here you go, and thank you.
-You're welcome, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Listen to what I say.
Do you understand me?
Rezo, I'm not a small child.
I know what I'm doing.
-You think you're better off now?
-Yes.
Don't you think about Soso?
Do you think it's OK to leave
Soso alone with Lamara and Otar?
He can go and live elsewhere.
I didn't ask him to live with my parents.
I don't want it...
I don't want everyone
talking about my sister.
Do you want me to kill someone?
I can't understand why you'll have
problems because of me.
How did you find this apartment?
Why in this district?
I rented an apartment I could afford.
Right.
I want to know
how much the rent is
and how much you earn.
I won't die of hunger.
I can tutor children, if necessary.
Many graduates ask me for private classes.
-Does anyone support you financially?
-What?
Who would support me?
I don't know, your friends?
Or you might be seeing someone?
Seeing someone?
What are you talking about?
Who was that strange man in your class?
Why do you talk to me like this?
He's my colleague, Gogi Sekhniashvil.
He teaches Georgian language
and literature.
You treat me like a little girl.
I don't need anyone to protect
or control me. I'm a grown woman.
You just look after
yourself and your family.
Leave me alone, all of you.
Ok, as you wish.
Do you need a lift to Varketili?
No, I'm not going home yet.
I'm going to your old home on Sunday.
You come, too.
Let's sit and talk together.
Haven't we talked it over already?
I don't need to go there.
Everyone's angry.
Manana, I implore you, do this for me.
Let's sit together
and talk it over quietly.
Please respect me.
Do this for me,
and I swear
I'll never ask anything of you
or bother you again.
-Who is it?
-Gas service.
You live here now?
-Are you a relative of Miranda's?
-No, I've just moved in.
I thought you were her sister
or a relative.
-Do you know Miranda?
-No.
She was a very good girl.
Do you know what she did?
What happened here?
She tried to poison herself with gas.
It was a big thing.
It was terrible.
Police, fire brigade, ambulance...
There was a big fuss.
Poor thing, her nerves were shot.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Nino, it's me. How are you?
Where are you? Are you OK?
I just called you to see how you were.
Ok, sure. Go now, take care.
Kisses to you too.
How are you?
What's up, Vakho?
Could I talk to you for a minute,
if you have time?
-Ok, go ahead.
-Come here, please.
I'm very sorry to come here
to talk to you.
I can't talk about it at home,
and besides, I don't know...
when I'll see you again.
What you saw the other day,
it's not what you think.
You don't have to explain anything to me.
Let's keep it between us,
don't say anything to Nino.
Wait, let's talk.
Don't put me in this situation.
Sort it out yourself.
I wouldn't like it if my mother
interfered between me and my husband.
-You'd better go and talk to Nino.
-Of course.
But don't tell her anything.
I'll explain everything to her.
Don't try to bargain with me.
I can't give you any hope or guarantees.
-Go and talk to Nino.
-Ok.
-I have to go.
-Please don't tell her.
-How are you?
-Fine, you?
Not too bad.
-What's up?
-Come in.
Hello.
-Hello.
-How are you?
Father, how are you?
What's wrong? Is everything OK?
You look like someone died.
It's worse than death, much worse.
-Do you feel unwell?
-Very bad.
If you feel bad,
call a doctor, not your relatives.
Leave me alone.
-I called these people.
-Right.
We want to talk to you.
-We're a family, aren't we?
-Do you want to talk to me?
I'm here, talk to me, I'm all ears.
Please,
tell me why you think we wish you harm?
-I don't think that.
-Look at Dato.
When he heard about you and Soso,
he couldn't sleep for two nights.
Come on. Were you worried about me?
You're like my elder sister.
-We grew up together.
-I know.
I feel uncomfortable
interfering like this.
I respect Soso, too.
But I want to tell you one thing.
I won't forgive anyone hurting you.
Dato, my dear...
That's all I wanted to say.
Thank you very much, but no one hurt me.
-You're worrying for nothing.
-For God's sake, Dato, sit down.
Don't pace up and down.
No one's hurt Manana
and you shouldn't say that.
There are elderly people here.
I beg you to listen to them.
They might say something wise.
You might like it.
If not, then ignore it.
And we'll leave you alone.
Ok, I'm listening.
You mustn't be angry with Rezo.
He did the right thing, calling us.
Didn't he?
You know you can talk to us.
It's our duty to help each other out
in times of need.
Neither I, nor my husband, are in need.
Please, don't worry.
My dear, Soso is devastated.
He looks like a ghost.
-I can't believe you don't see it.
-Mother.
Don't interrupt me.
I want to tell you one thing.
I have recently turned 79.
I have seen many things in my life.
I can tell you one thing for sure.
In this world, there are no families
without any problems.
There are always problems. It's normal.
Would you like a drink, Mr. Vazha?
Of course, I have nothing to do with it...
but it's a very complex situation.
-I want to tell you something.
-Tell me.
Think carefully.
Think carefully twice.
I want to tell you the same thing.
Think about this.
Think over the steps you're taking.
It's embarrassing for your family.
Come on, Uncle Zaur, stop it.
Manana, dear.
You're at the age
where you should have a grandchild.
It's no time for quarreling.
Aunt Meri, it's my business
who I quarrel or make peace with.
Uncle Zaur, could you please tell me
how my behavior
is embarrassing to my family?
-I didn't mean it.
-Then I don't understand.
-Wait a minute.
-Rezo, wait, I'll talk to her.
-What is it, Aunt Meri?
-I want to know...
why you left your family?
-I don't understand.
-What does it matter?
You might not understand,
but I won't explain it to anyone.
-Look at Ketino.
-What do I have to do with it?
-She's not divorced.
-And?
She has no children, she's educated.
We know.
With two diplomas.
She's a great girl, but she is unmarried.
Because it's very difficult, my dear.
You have a good husband.
I didn't know my husband
had so many fans among my relatives.
Soso's a very good man.
What can I say... You're so ungrateful.
-Meri, stop it.
-Thank you.
-Stop it, she gets it.
-Leave me alone.
I wonder why she decided
to start a new life at this age.
And who with.
What are you talking about?
You're just imagining things now.
I say you should take care of Soso.
A man out of his mind
is capable of doing anything.
He can look after himself.
He doesn't need you.
You shouldn't drive a man
past breaking point.
Are you all out of your mind?
What are you talking about?
-What breaking point?
-Meri and Zaur, listen.
Don't go out of your way
to stir up passions.
Leave them alone.
They'll look after themselves.
Wait, are you saying we have no say here?
How is it your business?
Leave her alone.
She understands what you're saying.
Leave her alone.
Listen, you're just kids
and don't understand many things.
You mean I don't understand,
but Meri, Vazha and Zaur understand?
How dare you call me Zaur? You rude boy.
Stop it now.
Thank you so much for taking care of me,
but I have to go now.
Manana, don't be offended...
Please, let there be no more quarreling.
I'm fine, don't worry about me.
Please call me.
A bunch of coriander,
spinach and tarragon, please.
I'll take it.
Thank you.
This piece, please.
Nato.
Hey, how are you?
Oh, my dear!
Long time no see.
You look so well.
-You look beautiful.
-Come on.
She was my classmate.
I haven't seen her for ages.
How are things? Are you still in Vedzisi?
No, I sold that apartment long ago.
Come here, talk to me.
-Why did you sell it?
-My husband fell into debt.
I had a terrible time, but I got over it.
-Where are you now?
-I was lucky...
-I want this cheese.
-What?
-I would like some cheese.
-Ask over there.
-It's good, too.
-You're busy.
-No, I haven't seen you for so long.
-What did you do then?
My husband and I had no home,
then I went to Lilo.
I bought a plot of land and a house.
I have a small farm now.
-I started my own business.
-That's great.
You just can't talk here.
We're fine now. My husband got wiser.
He helps me as much as he can.
How about you?
-Still a teacher?
-Yes.
How are your children? No coffee, thanks.
My daughter got married.
-My son is still young, he's 20.
-I saw Dalakishvili and Khoshtaria.
-Really?
-Yes, they asked about you.
-They wanted your phone number.
-Why?
They want a class reunion in Tskneti.
-At Museridze's.
-That's great.
Do you know how long it's been
since we left school?
-No idea.
-35 years.
It's been so long.
-How are the girls?
-Just great.
They've always lived the high life.
-They don't work here like me.
-Come on.
-But I'm very happy.
-That's good.
Of course.
Can you take my phone out from my pocket?
My hands are dirty.
Call yourself so I'll have your number.
-Is everything OK?
-How are you?
-Fine, and you?
-I'm well.
I thought you were angry with me
and I decided to visit you.
I also wanted to know where you live
and how you're doing. May I?
Of course.
-Will you show me the house?
-Yes, come.
This is it.
Fourth floor.
No offense, but...
do you think it's a good idea
to live in this hole?
-Come on, don't start.
-How do you get to work from here?
I get to work easily,
I use public transport.
It's a good neighborhood.
-Unbelievable.
-It is.
The air is better here.
I'll get some fruit.
Mark my words,
you'll soon leave this place.
Ok.
Hello.
-Kusho, what are you doing here?
-Rezo, how are you?
My good man.
-Do you live here?
-Yes, I moved here.
-How are you doing?
-Up and down.
He's a good man, Rezo.
-How are your children?
-Growing up, you know how it is...
My good man. It's good to see you.
One minute, please. I'm sorry.
-Is everything OK?
-Yes, sure.
My sister moved here.
You know people here, don't you?
-Yes, of course.
-She's alone now.
She has some problems with her family.
My brother-in-law is a very good man.
Everything will be OK.
There are so many assholes in this world.
I don't want them to give her trouble.
That is what worries me.
Come, the coffee is ready.
Try it. The cake is delicious.
I'm sure you'll get sick of it
soon enough.
Come on.
Why do you wish bad things on me?
I feel wonderful here.
As you wish, Manana.
-But you should know one thing.
-What?
If you ever need me to...
I'll come and pack your things,
and I'll carry all your things back home.
I swear I won't hold it against you.
Ok.
If I decide to move, I'll call you,
but I'm not going anywhere.
I am really happy here.
Excuse me.
I need guitar strings.
Where can I find some?
-Down there.
-Thank you.
-Is it seven string?
-Yes.
I want the seventh string, if you have it.
-Is this it?
-Yes, this, and that.
I'll check.
Very good.
-How much is it?
-Two laris.
Thank you very much.
You have nothing to worry about.
Everything is in order.
These kids amaze me.
They worry for no reason.
Continue with the folic...
Please show her in.
Continue with folic acid.
One pill of folic acid.
Once a day.
Healthy lifestyle.
Let's agree on what it means.
Good food, fresh air...
Is it normal that I'm not pregnant?
It's been a year.
Could it be psychological?
Come on, don't blow it out of proportion.
What's the rush? It will happen.
How long was it for you
after you got married?
About six months.
I'm telling you,
something's wrong with me.
Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong?
You should see things differently.
It might be good
that you don't get pregnant.
Why good?
You're young.
You could go somewhere,
to study or just travel.
You don't need much money for that.
You have plenty of time to have a baby.
In the meantime...
you and Vakho
will get to know each other better.
You will know...
whether
you are meant for each other or not.
It takes time.
Do you have any doubts about it?
-No.
-I'll tell you what.
You had problems with Dad and left him.
It doesn't mean I should too.
-I didn't mean that.
-You project onto others.
-That's why you think so.
-Calm down.
I've lived with him for a year
and I should get to know him better?
Please, don't be angry.
Don't interfere in my life.
I can go to the doctor myself, too.
You're very negative and destructive.
You're like Otar.
What's wrong with you?
I just want what's best for you.
-Please, don't be angry.
-It's OK, forget it.
Tell me how you are doing.
How is the apartment?
Do you like it there?
Come, come quickly.
The almond tree was blooming
The sun cast its reddish glow
In the heart of almond tree flowers
You came then
And caressed me
But I didn't believe
my love
See the almond tree blossomed
In my heart like it was yesterday
Thank you.
Everyone will be there. Is it here?
-The air is so fresh here.
-No, I don't think it's here.
Did we get out too early?
No, it must be over there. Let's walk.
-It's so nice here.
-It's been so long.
-My heart's pounding.
-I can imagine.
-Manana?
-What?
Can I ask you something?
Don't tell anyone about the market.
-What's wrong with the market?
-Nothing, but still...
Come on. Ok, as you wish.
-Did they tell everyone?
-Yes, I think so.
-Hey, girls.
-They came, they're here.
Mkheidze and Ebanoidze.
I can't believe it.
Manana, my dear. How I've missed you!
You look so beautiful.
Put her down.
Now it's my turn.
Three cheers for our class, number 10B.
Hooray!
-Hip hip...
-...hooray!
-Hip hip...
-...hooray!
You've just drunk a toast to me.
Now I propose a toast.
Unfortunately...
some of your classmates
are not here with us today.
Alas.
Asatiani, Abuladze, Adamia...
Okruashvili.
Uchava.
Uchava, my dears.
Now, I want to drink a toast to you.
You must live.
You must live
on behalf of those classmates.
Live a long and happy life.
Cheers to you, kids.
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
They were not ordinary guys.
They could not reach the peak...
Could not get a foothold
in this whirl of life.
So, they left us.
God rest their souls.
I can be out of luck
Misfortunes may befall me
I will sing once again
To feel joy in my heart
Is it not better to have a rose
on your face than soot
One is not a man who...
Great wine.
-No more for me, I'm drunk.
-Me too.
It's her fault. She made me drink.
You're taking me home.
-I told you I would.
-Tell me how you're doing.
-How are you? Your kids? Soso?
-We're fine.
Was Soso angry that we met together
without our spouses?
Don't worry. He has enough parties.
-Let's not talk about men.
-They're like small children.
-Is your daughter married?
-She is.
-How old is she?
-23.
-I can't believe it.
-But I'm not a grandma yet.
It's too early to be grandmas.
The boy is 20, he's a student.
I've recently separated from Soso.
I left the house and I live alone now.
Manana, I can't believe it.
-What are you saying?
-Recently, all I hear is bad news.
I just can't believe it.
Wait, which house?
I know you lived with your mother.
I no longer live there.
I live alone in an apartment.
Did Soso buy another place?
No, he lives with my parents.
I rented an apartment.
He stayed with them.
Why are you so surprised?
Her parents raised Soso
as their own child.
But I really feel good, girls.
I've always wanted to live alone.
It feels really good.
You'll reconcile, I know it.
-No.
-Come on, don't say that.
-Wait. Does Soso work now?
-Yes, he works.
-Did you quarrel?
-No, we didn't.
There were no quarrels or rows.
Was he violent?
-No, absolutely not.
-Come on, I know Soso well.
How about the sex, was it OK?
Did he want anal sex?
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about?
What? Haven't you heard of it?
I know many women
whose husbands demand it.
That's why Dundua divorced her husband.
Unbelievable.
-Have you seen Museridze?
-He's outside.
-I'm serious.
-Go outside.
-Please... we're talking.
-Why are you acting like this?
-Tell me, how is Soso?
-Why should we worry about Soso?
Soso's fine. He's getting used to it.
You put up with a lot from him.
-I agree.
-Many women wouldn't have.
What do you mean?
Just imagine.
I wouldn't have put up with it.
No offense, Manana.
I wouldn't put up with a man like Soso.
-You're a saint.
-It's not like that.
-What is it like, then?
-You know, for the family.
Until the children grow up,
the financial situation...
One moment, please.
What you are talking about?
-Doesn't she know?
-About what?
What do you expect?
Her head is in the clouds.
Are you totally in the dark?
Soso had an affair
with Tevdoradze's cousin.
No!
It happened a while back.
She had a boy with him.
-No!
-Yes. He must be 13 now.
-Or 14?
-Oh, my God.
Oh yeah.
Do the children keep in touch
with each other?
I swear, I didn't know anything.
Ok, enough. Why are you making
such a big deal of it?
She divorced her husband, so what?
It's over now.
And she isn't interested
in who her husband had an affair with.
-My nephew's in his class.
-And?
He looks so much like Soso.
He's a very sweet boy, slightly round.
-It's not the boy's fault.
-What can Soso do about it?
He cares for the boy as much as he can.
-He left the woman a long time ago.
-And then?
She was an evil woman. She made him
choose between her or his wife.
So he left her.
Poor Manana, you've gone through so much.
Soso loved that woman very much.
Don't you remember?
He was often at the Tevdoradzes.
-No, I don't remember.
-She had black, curly hair.
-She was a pretty girl.
-I wouldn't call her pretty.
-Why?
-I never liked her.
Calm down, pour me one.
Let's drink to Manana.
-Cheers.
-To Manana's new life.
-Manana, may you be happy.
-She will be happy.
Of course.
Oh, girls,
let me tell you about Chikovani.
You will be so shocked.
Did you know this, Manana?
Girls... Madam. You promised me a song.
-No, I can't sing right now.
-What?
Let's go.
Let's go.
David, come.
Give it to me.
Your reverence, bless us.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen.
My friends.
Can I have your attention, please?
-Now.
-I can't...
-Our excellent student will sing.
-I can't sing.
-Manana Mkheidze.
-I can't sing right now.
I can't.
Please sing.
-We haven't heard you sing in years.
-Take it, Manana.
-Sing, like you used to.
-We want to hear you sing, please.
Go ahead, my dear, go on.
No, I can't.
-Please.
-Go on.
One moment, please.
You're such a darling. You're a wonder.
The mole on your face
Suits you so much
Come and sit beside me
Liven me up
You are so good
Passionate and full of life
When I die, my dear
You will become my tombstone
You used to be my rose
But now you are my grief
You avoid me and stay away from me
Please tell me
If someone else is better than me
Without you my strength is gone
If you did not know what love is
Why did you come to me?
Why did you walk my street at nights?
The striped clothes
and the gown suit you
Boy, never think of betraying me
You are so good
So good
Passionate and full of life
When I die, my dear
Become a tombstone covering my grave
Who is it?
-Gas service.
-Who?
Gas service.
May I come in?
-Where is the gas meter?
-Over here.
-Datuna, who is it?
-It's just the gas service.
Yeah, sure.
It's there, madam.
-Hey.
-Aren't you coming down?
-I can't be bothered.
-Damn, why are you so lazy?
Thank you, goodbye.
One minute.
Excuse me, just a minute.
-Are you talking to me?
-Who else?
Don't I have to sign something?
No, not you.
It's someone from the gas service.
I wonder who his friends are.
Does anyone know him at all?
I wonder what he wanted.
Here, please.
What?
Where?
Are you serious?
And then?
No, I didn't know.
Yes, OK.
Ok, wait a minute.
Ok.
Wait. What are you doing?
Put that bread and chocolate back.
Stop eating it now.
But I'm hungry.
If you're hungry, I'll fry some potatoes.
-Leave me alone.
-What? Show this lady out.
The boy drives me nuts.
I'm so angry with him.
I think I should take him
to a nutritionist or psychologist.
I should do something.
He's gonna reach 100 kilos.
What will I do then?
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
Hi, Lasha.
At home. Everything's fine. How are you?
No, Lasha, I can't come now. What's wrong?
I can't come now, I don't feel well.
Tell me what's wrong.
Are they at home?
Ok, I'll come.
What happened? What's going on?
Father, what's wrong with you?
What happened?
Will you tell me what happened?
Nino threw a pan at Vakho.
Vakho moved, and the pan hit Grandad.
-What's wrong with your head?
-Nothing.
How do you know that nothing's wrong?
How dare you talk for others?
-Calm down, Father.
-I survived the Communists.
When KGB agents came for us...
I was the only one
in my family to survive.
I have survived
so many shitty governments.
Now I have to put up with this government.
And now my granddaughter
is trying to kill me.
Calm down, she didn't mean to.
She's very sorry about it.
-She has a lot on her plate.
-Don't I have enough on my plate?
You ask God to kill you so often
that this is how he punished you.
I said I wanted to die.
I never said
that I wanted my granddaughter
to smash my head in.
Mother, where are the glasses?
She put them there.
How are you?
Fine.
Are you having a rest from me?
Are you settled in?
As much as possible.
The apartment is good.
I just need to put up shelves.
All my things are on the floor.
And you? How are you?
-Does anyone want ice?
-Put one or two cubes in.
I want ice, too.
How am I?
How do I know how I am?
Are you drinking?
-Take care of yourself.
-I'm OK, I feel well and healthy.
My health is excellent.
Very good.
Manana, listen.
-I'll come and do the shelves.
-No.
Listen.
If you want, I can do it, no problem.
No, Soso, it's OK.
My girl.
Don't cry.
Sit down.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine, you'll see.
Drink some water and don't cry, please.
Drink.
If I were pregnant,
everything would be better now.
Please don't say that.
Calm down, my girl.
You know I'd be happy
if you were pregnant.
Everything will be fine.
It hurts now, but after a while,
you'll see things differently.
Everything will be fine.
You're a beautiful...
good girl...
and young.
You'll have so many suitors.
You'll fall in love with someone
and have a baby with him.
Come here.
Let me pass.
-Help us. They'll be here soon.
-I'll be right there.
-Lamara, where should I put this box?
-Put it on my head.
Take that to your room
and put it in a drawer.
What do you want, Otar?
How can I help?
Isn't it obvious? Look around.
If you see things lying around,
put them away.
Oh, really?
-The bell is ringing. Open the door.
-I'll get it.
Lamara called me.
She said I should come right away.
-It's OK, calm down.
-What happened?
Lasha's getting married.
Are you kidding?
-Is he here?
-Not yet.
Come.
The lock is broken. My key doesn't work.
It's not broken, we replaced it.
Why?
Vakho has a key
and Nino doesn't want him here.
That's why I replaced it.
-We have one for you, if you want it.
-Ok.
Sweet mercy.
I wonder if this girl has any parents.
She has a mother, she's an only child.
A mother?
I wonder what her mother does,
if she's a decent woman...
What do you mean by decent?
Decent means decent.
She's a medical assistant. She
works with Tsamalashvili's sister-in-law.
-Right?
-Yes.
-Don't you know this girl?
-Why would I?
-I don't know.
-How come?
-Do I have to know everyone?
-Don't you?
You almost gave me a heart attack.
I thought someone died,
so I ran all the way here.
And is it not heartbreaking?
My heart breaks when I think
about who's joining our family,
and she doesn't care.
-She lives comfortably alone.
-Stop arguing, please.
Stop now, it's not the time.
-Hold your tongue.
-Stop it.
-They're here.
-Who will open the door?
-I will.
-No, mother...
It would be better if Nino opens it.
-Let her open it.
-What's so bad about it?
Nothing mother, simply...
Hi, Nino. This is Kitsi.
-Nice to meet you.
-Come.
-This is Kitsi.
-Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Hello, I'm Kitsi.
-Mother.
-Hello.
-Hello, I'm Kitsi.
-Lamara.
Why is everyone standing?
Sit down, everyone.
Kitsi, sit down.
Give me your bag, I'll put it over here.
It was torture.
We got stuck in traffic for an hour.
Yes, it was a nightmare.
Why didn't you call me? I'm here to help.
It's OK, nothing important.
I'm a bit confused now.
I don't know how to put names to faces.
It's OK, I'll tell you.
-You are Soso, right?
-Yes.
I'm the mother, Manana.
-Grandmother.
-Mrs. Lamara.
I know Otar.
Nino, you look so familiar.
That's what I thought.
-But I can't remember from where.
-I wonder...
-May I?
-Of course.
Help yourself. It's all for you.
May I ask you a question?
-Mother.
-Lamara, please...
-What's wrong? Let me talk.
-Ask me anything you want.
Is Kitsi your real name?
-No, my real name is Tamuna.
-Thank goodness.
Tamar, to be more exact.
But I really hate that name.
If you call me Tamuna or Tamar,
I won't answer you.
Why, my dear?
It's true.
This will be yours and Lasha's bedroom.
It's not what it should be, but...
Are you kidding? It's great.
The only bad thing in this room
is the wardrobe.
It's so big we couldn't get it out,
so we all keep our clothes here.
-Is it OK if I leave my stuff here?
-Of course. No problem.
You can't imagine how happy I am
that we'll have a baby here soon.
-You have such a cute bump.
-Thank you.
Who is your doctor?
I'm going to fry some potatoes,
make a salad.
-And bake Khachapuri.
-Very good.
I have a chicken, but it's frozen.
-Let's buy something from the shop.
-No, let's use what we have.
-It's embarrassing.
-Don't worry.
Here's some watermelon.
It's sweet, help yourself.
What are you doing out here?
Could you ever imagine this?
We'll soon have a grandchild.
The cherries
Have ripened
New juice
Is dripping from the fern
I didn't know, girl
That you were trembling then
Your sparkling diamond eyes
Your shy sidesteps
You gave yourself away
While I was picking leaves of...
-I'll go now.
-All right, darling.
What are you doing?
-What?
-You left without saying anything.
I have to get up early tomorrow.
I told Lasha I wouldn't stay for long.
I'll give you a lift. Come and join us.
Everyone's happier when you're here.
I'll give you a lift.
How can you? You've been drinking.
Only two glasses.
-No, I'll take a taxi.
-Wait.
Take a taxi later.
Please come.
I'll put you in a taxi and take you home.
Is our home so bad
that you can't spend an evening with us?
I swear, if it's late,
I'll put you in a taxi
and I'll go straight home.
Why should you take me? I'm not scared.
Of course.
You aren't scared of anything.
You're a tough girl.
I must go.
Wait, please.
You know, I wonder...
-What is it?
-When will you come back?
You see, I say nothing...
I say nothing and wait for you.
But you know, it isn't easy.
-Are you waiting for me?
-Of course.
I have my own home,
and I'm not going to come back.
What am I supposed to do? Where's my home?
Where is my place?
Ok, I can go.
It's no problem.
I can live wherever I want.
-Yes.
-But...
Until now I thought it was my home,
that it was where I belonged.
That you were my home,
and Lasha, Nino, Lamara and Otar too.
-Go home then. They're waiting for you.
-You really are a piece of work.
-Why must everything be your way?
-That's not true.
-Ok, I won't say anything.
-Please, I need to get up early.
-Please go back.
-Can't I even walk you to a taxi?
Ok.
Hey, we want to go to Varketili.
-Ok.
-Here's the money.
-What?
-What about the shelves?
-What shelves?
-In your apartment.
I've not done them yet.
I'll put them up as soon as I can.
I'm going. Take care.
-It's you, come in.
-How are you?
-Ok. And you?
-Fine.
-Did you find it easily?
-Of course.
-Your coat?
-No thanks. This is for you.
You really shouldn't have.
Come in.
It will fit here, too. You can move this.
One here, the other there,
or next to each other, maybe...
I think it's better there.
As you wish.
Ok then, I'll start.
Wait, take a breath. Are you in a hurry?
-No, I'm not in a hurry.
-Come see the rest of the apartment.
This is the other room.
It's really nice.
Yes, I've got used to it.
It's not big, but it's cozy.
I'll show you the kitchen.
It was so messy when I moved in.
I've been cleaning it ever since.
It looks neat now.
What is this?
It's home-made wine,
my friends gave it to me.
It's young wine.
I thought you might like it.
Thank you.
What are these?
Tomatoes. I planted them
and now they've grown.
That's great.
Will you have something to eat?
If you're offering, I will.
I've cooked. Nothing special, but...
I've been at home all day.
So I cooked something.
It smells wonderful.
It will be ready soon.
-I'll go and start then.
-Ok.
It's ready.
-This is a feast.
-It's nothing special.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
I'll drink to you.
Wherever you are.
Thank you.
Cheers.
-The wine is quite good, isn't it?
-Very good wine.
Have some.
I think it's pretty good.
Have some corn bread.
And some of this.
It's not quite as good as Lamara's, but...
It's very good.
-Is it?
-Yes, really.
How are things at home?
How are Lamara and Otar?
As usual.
Lamara is fine, in good health.
Otar no longer speaks about death so much.
He's happy,
waiting for his great-grandchild.
-So everything's good.
-Great.
-How about Lasha and Kitsi?
-They're fine.
Well...
Kitsi is a very good child.
-She's a very good girl.
-Yes.
Sometimes I think,
why on earth did she marry him?
Maybe he isn't as bad as you think.
Is he still glued to the computer?
Not so much. He goes out a bit.
I think he's looking for a job.
I don't know, he won't tell me.
He won't tell anyone.
It was Kitsi who told me.
How is Nino? Has she got over it?
Yes, I think so.
She had some friends over recently.
They had fun, cheered her up.
Kitsi joined them, too.
They had a great time.
-Has Vakho turned up?
-Vakho?
I'll break his head
if I ever see him, that bastard.
Come on.
It's getting colder, at last.
How are you doing?
How is your life?
What can I say...?
-Hello, madam.
-Hello.
Excuse me. Could you call your guest?
We're your neighbors.
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.
-A moment?
-Is my car blocking yours?
-Yes.
-I'll move it then.
I'll come now.
-Sorry about this.
-Not at all.
-I'm very sorry about this.
-It's not the car that's the problem.
Then what is it?
Listen, bro, we have a favor to ask.
What is it?
I don't want you
disturbing this lady again.
What?
What are you laughing at, man?
-What's your name?
-Irakli.
Are you looking for trouble, son?
Listen.
That's a married woman in there.
Did you know she has a husband and family?
Did you know that?
Did you know you're cute?
-Get your hands off me.
-Or what?
You goon, you should talk
to adults with more respect.
How dare you talk to me like that?
Who are you, anyway?
-What's this? What's going on?
-Let me handle it.
-What do you want with my husband?
-He's your husband?
Yes, he's my husband.
Are you Rezo's brother-in-law?
The good man?
-Did Rezo send you?
-Don't you people have any shame?
He's such a fool.
-What the hell?
-Sorry.
You should be.
-Let's go.
-Your behavior is outrageous.
Rezo asked us to watch over you.
I don't need watching over.
I'm not a child who misbehaved.
We know who's who now, so let's split.
Ok, goodbye.
If Rezo told you to jump in a river,
would you do that?
We are sorry.
-Don't you have any brains?
-Ok, let's go.
What's Rezo up to?
How dare he treat me like that?
How dare he speak about me to those fools?
He acts like a child. He never grew up.
He interferes with my life.
-Ok, calm down.
-How can I calm down?
-Do you think it's OK?
-No, I don't.
Did you hear what they said?
Watch over me?
I don't need them watching over me.
I didn't want to deal with those guys.
I'll talk to Rezo about it.
I'm so tired, Soso.
I don't need such a family.
Nor do I need such a brother.
Come on, Manana, you know how he is.
This is how he operates.
It's how he's lived his life.
You understand him, don't you?
Let me through.
I just mean you don't have
to be upset about it.
-Calm down.
-"It's how he's lived his life."
So what should I do, then?
-And you?
-Me?
How have you lived your life?
Do you know it all?
Who are you?
