Florence, put the eggs

This pudding Bavarian

Mother ...
These meetings encourage
the sexual act.
It's not like in the movies.

If so, go free.
As an expert, perhaps
you can help me.
You Will See ...
I have a friend
it worries me.
It has blackouts.
What kind of loopholes?
Well ...
He says that when he returns itself
remembers nothing but ...
believes that in this period
It is crazy.
Well ...

I have no information to
an accurate diagnosis but ...
I suffered episodes
of schizophrenic psychosis.
I did not know Berdine

You have no friend.
So I am a
lonely girl.
Sorry, I did not mean that.

OK, a truce.
I recall what I said,

Test yourself this.
It is your household size.
I dont know ...
It makes me look too fat.
We were looking for something to
exorcism.
We do not spoil anything.
Of course.
These white feathers are
well with your tan.
I do not think it is
the appropriate color.
Try the black,
a Parisian model.
Hey, I do not think ...
truly ...
There is nothing wrong with
dressing well.
That's why I'm an actress.
We should go to the salon
Beauty afternoon.
Clear. We lose,
you know ...
The others are waiting for us ...
Yes, yes, the other ...
? But they have not even seen
my shoes!
Berdine,? I have been strange to
lately?
? Besides being a snob
nosy?
I misbehaved.
It's okay. Now these
with the beautiful people.
Be a best friend
this misplaced.
As Sartre would say ...
What I want to know ...
? I think episodes
psychotic schizophrenic?
? Schizophrenic?
? Where do you get that from?
Starcat told me,
before we talk.
? This often happens?
The last time was when
Junior was killed.
? It's not funny!
Do not be so serious,
it was a joke.
? He is dead?
Well dead.
- T.J.!
- Do not touch anything.
Cookie, what do you have in your mouth?
? OMG!
This killing my friends,
I do not want to die ..
This experience, this
sense of loss.
Those deaths ...
? It's too much!
? This is your answer
the crimes?
? Wait until we are
all dead?
We heard nothing.
Only the cry.
That cry sono
with feeling.
Sweetie, passion ...
Something burning inside.
Ms. Barnes, I hope my
colleagues do not bother him.
No.
I'm fine.
This drama just makes me
a better artist.
Within weeks, this drama
It will be an experience ...
tr? logic, and all this
It transformed me ...
... Part of all this.
? Est? listening?
Keep it up.
Keep the rhythm.
? Stronger!
? Now I just!
? I see the light!
? What it happens?
I catch my breath.
Talk to the sergeant.
I told him about marriage
and floral arrangements.
have you been busy.
Well, I want to marry.
? It is not very soon?
? Why? ? Did not
we are ready?
Well, next month volume
the test for detective.
• Do not plan on having children?
? Children?
? You do not joke!
My career has just begun.
Surely you can understand.
I suppose,
we're just cops on foot.
I want more.
A bastards show them?
a woman can be a detective.
? And where I stay?
Dear ...
you stay with me.
? No!
I'm not your fucking.
? Do not talk like that!
I do not want this.
None of this.
Kanaka.
Dear, success
it does not mean anything ...
if you are not with me.
? I need you!
? Monica!
-? Are you okay?
- Of course.
It is rare that the victim had
only one testicle in the mouth.
They usually come in pairs.
Because only had one.
Verification.
A sausage, a single potato.
Cookie ...
the girl who was killed
at the drive ...
? Had a scar?
Yes, not ?.
He had harelip.
Clear. A birth defect.
The surfer had psoriasis.
And this guy only had
one testicle.
Cookie ...
someone has problems
different people.
Look at this toy knife.
No short or a sandwich.
If there's something I can not stand,
It is the imperfection.
No place in the world
for that.
It's not the same without
T.J. or Junior.
I still remember the image of T. J.
tanning on the beach.
And to think I had
only one testicle ...
You never know people.
Yes.
Kanaka,? We cancel the party,
as respect for the dead?
No way, we should celebrate
full moon ...
to greet God,
King Neptune.
Yes, we have fun.
? We? He said it again.
Let the girl to come together
men, maybe it ...
good mixing,
such as coca-cola with rum.
Will it be fabulous!
I've never been to an orgy.
? I wear?
I must go, Marvel Ann
I am waiting for me.
I promised a gift
not to forget.
Clear.
Dr. Edwards served before us
people drink.
So we planted the evidence
of blood. My mother hated.
But in this case,
I feel lost.
You are a specialist in treating
homicidal maniacs.
Yes, but I have never participated
in a criminal investigation.
do not worry ...
I take care of
police work.
I would like to know
What kind of sick
We are looking for?
The psychologist? Ticos ...
become vulnerable ...
... And unhappy and are considered
pose? two somehow.
Give me a profile.
In my opinion ...
It has an intelligence
more child well.
Vulnerable, but sweet.
Able to express tenderness
and extreme brutality.
The murderer is very
intelligent ...
but curiously, lost
contact with reality.
A curious mixture of
sexuality and innocence.
This Single? Duo ...
He wants desperately
normal.
Extremely complicating
your research.
? Why?
Because spare no? efforts
just to look normal.
He or she could be
any.
? What are you doing?
A pagan god of sex,
Lual for the party.
What a coincidence. I need
any advice on that.
You Will See ...
a friend of mine
Do you have a friend.
But she wants to be
something more than friends.
I should know ...
? You owe it mean?
? The respect ??
First lesson n?:
No offer.
Nobody likes it
something so f? cyl.
Like me, I have a friend
I have not seen in a while.
The strange as.
Even s? as
I tell him.
? The name Ann Bowman
She tells you something?
No. Do you live around here?
Very close.
What he likes
It is a mystery to me.
? Your back hurts?
I'm losing control.
Get out before committing
crazy.
Yes. Mama dies if you know
I'm here alone with a man.
I do not know why ...
if I am not even remotely
sensual.
I mean ...
? Ann? ? You came back?
Finally ...
that idiot not me
She left back.
They are circles? If?
All right, Einstein.
Señora, I've been a kid or bad.
At the kids are bad
whips, are punished.
? Great!
What are you doing dressed like a bitch?
? You are crazy?
? Ann?
? Ann?
? Ann? My name Tylene.
Tylene Carmichael Carmel.
I am cashier. Until 16:30,
then my boss ...
I want back to Ann.
Look what I have for you.
It away. I have a
knife? I cut ?!
Quiet, bad idea.
Fuck me boy.
Or try to escape.
The world wants
rid of me ...
but I reappear as the Fenix
to reclaim the mine.
Ann Bowman, dominating,
Empress of planet Earth.
Touching huh?
I'm going to lose my head.
Miss B., Here

They are they terribly human!
Do not call attention.

Yes, it's very brave.

You're very kind.
And very pretty.
So this is your
true voice.
It does not sound forced to
seem funny.
- You Want to join us?
- No, I must go home.
Friends come to dinner.
Berdine not est? S guest.
Ms. Barnes, I am a
fan of yours.
For his upcoming films,
You must use best c? maras.
So could? cover

terrible horror movies?
I need air.

Ms. Barnes ...
Because I feel a deja vu?
I have a pair of handcuffs on
my purse? s why?
What a coincidence ...
When you show emerges
another scene.
Listen ...
? I is accusing?
Guys, sit, please.
I want to talk about
the murders.
One of you could be
the next victim.
-? Because we?
- Until now ...
We have a girl
cleft lip,
An invalid in
Wheelchair,
a boy with psoriasis,
and another with a single
testicle.
Do they have something the murderer
You might consider ... defective?
Come on, confess.
Everyone has something to hide.
As they say nothing,
I dir you ?.
Provoloney is? so constipated ...
it needs 67 days to
go ba? o.
? Want to see something funny?
Starcat, show the big toe.
Is incarnated? u? a,
They want to vomit.
? You think this is funny?
Wheelchair,
cleft lips ...
? How you want
We not laugh at us ?.
Guys.
I hope someday people
that is not black humor white.
Yo Yo,? Nothing to say?
There's nothing wrong with me.
it's for your own good.
? You do not sit down ...
"Different"
somehow?
Maybe a little.
? What are you talking about?
You are 100% natural.
But if ...
sometimes I feel like ...
something inside me ...
it is like ...
I feel for the ...
I mean ...
Provoloney and ...
? I can not believe it! ? Marica!
Hopefully the murderer kills.
? Provoloney!
How was my voice?
As an old 30 years.
"Berdine, dear"
Do not dir? S anyone
I'm crazy? if?
? Of course not!
Florence Nenita,
you're my best friend.
Save? your secret
forever.
-? Would you do that for me?
- Daria my life.
It makes me feel like before ...
when we were alone
two of us.
Florence,? Can you
ask a favor?
I want to use these pants
Saturday night.
But lacks the button.
I'm not good with needles.
Every time I try
I feel like a fool.
- Of course, Lars.
- Thank You.
? The Lual! I die
for I know everything.
I will not go.
? You have to go! You worked all
the summer to invite you.
What if there comes another loophole
and I throw it all away?
Who appears when
I come lagoon?
Will it be I the mat? to everyone?
Could not? back to school.
You must finish the race.
It is terrible to see how
wasting the head ...
that has so much potential
to earn money.
So parents speak.
Kanaka says I can
be a great surfer.
? Where are you going?
I'm planning my future,
and you do not est? s on him.
And here are your pants
boxing.
I'll help with that.
? Do not touch me!
Here it is released.
Marvel Ann, I'm sorry.
You did it on purpose.
You're a selfish, crazy,
disgusting and perverted.
I suggest you take
the correct road ...
and you behave like a
decent Presbyterian.
Problem with a girl?
It is more than that.
I am a very complex being,
deeply anxious and nervous.
? Because I say this?
You're just a ni? a.
I'm not a ni? A, I am ...
How would Kanaka,
"Lewd and voluptuous".
He does not say that, liar.
Teach me or surfing,
and always she wants to be with me.
We actually had in his Caba? A
one t you? -? - t you intimate?.
You say to make me jealous.
If the USSR declared war,
not let you stay in my refuge.
? We were not in a truce?
You need not be so bad.
Starcat ...
What were you doing with Marvel Ann?
When they were alone.
I do verg? Embarrassment.
Tell me, I must learn
those things.
He huddled close to me.
? So?
Yes, well.
And put my arm around another.
? So? ? What else?
He kissed her neck from behind.
you know ...
in the movies, sit
together on the rocks, for example.
? I can not do it with you!
? Come on, think
Marvel'm Ann!
I do not want to think
I'm frigid.
I stroked her arm
and she kissed my chest.
? It drew clothes?
He stroked her soft skin.
The sun shone.
She touched my muscles
with the tip of his fingers.
He knelt as if
in a trance.
My erect penis touched her face.
He puts it on his cheek,
a hand grabbed my balls
and he touched my anus with another finger.
? God!
? Nenita, come back!
Kanaka.
I do not like
surprises visitors.
I wanted to get there first
that Nenita.
? Why?
It's not your girl.
Nor should be yours.
It's just a ni? a.
That's what you think.
- If you put a finger ...
- Quiet, I have not touched.
But I must tell you ...
It is phenomenal.
There is something in it
you can not imagine.
It's like two girls in one.
? What are you talking about?
It's odd, but they are like
twin in one body.
? You say you have double
personality?
One is an angel. The other is
a demon named Ann Bowman.
And it becomes
blink of an eye.
? You think this Ann Bowman
It could be violent?
Tell me.
Hope you
you have disinfected.
I hate to say, but this girl
could be the murderer of Malibu.
Hi ..
Hello.
We talked about you.

You look like the CIA.
Nenita ...
Redecor? the place.
? How about my curtain?
Full of c? Circles.

And if they stop me ...

Unfortunately yes.
When Riley leaves the house

I wonder if there

It is causing you.
It causes me some time.
Wedge Riley.
? What brings you to our
small a celebration?
It is a friendly visit,

I like the views, but

Calma daddy.
This is not your territory.
Let me give you some advice ...

A ritual that began?
Del Mar 52.
? Forget Wedge!
? What about the sacrifice
of a virgin? I say ...

You should not be here.

we have no virgin.
Well, I offer.
I'm your man.

Fresh-fresh

No blindfold ...
What's going on back there?

In their own way ...
He thought he was saving
those poor people.
I'm in no mood to talk,

I understand completely.
However, I surprised me

Almost boring.
Sorry if you disappointment ?.
There is so much ugliness in the world.

All these revelations
They have given me hungry.

I think not.
Psychologically not fit.

You're going to hell, imb? Cyl.

They must be at the drive.
How could you do that

They were like the others.
No one understands.
Try it. I can

You can not imagine what it is
Growing up in a house abnormal.
My mother was blind ...

Very good.
You want to fight?

Let's go from here.
We have much to improve.
Maybe I should greet

Serious best.
I'm proof of that.
I must return to classes.

I was wondering ...
