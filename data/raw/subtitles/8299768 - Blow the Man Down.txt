One of the greatest
gifts our mother gave us
was her strong moral compass.
There was a lot to love
about Mary Margaret.
Her booming laugh, her smile.
Sister sippers. To Mom.
Fuck you!
Come on. What the fuck?
Come on.
I'm not going in there.
Get away from me!
Get off!
Goddamn motherfucker,
goddamn it!
Fuck off!
You're never getting
this fucking money back!
- Here you go.
- Ah.
- You good?
- Thank you.
- Yeah? Need anything?
- I don't think so.
Okay, okay.
Been a long fight.
Girls, there you are.
It's the blind
leading the blind over here.
Do you have any soda water, hon?
- Oh, yeah.
- Soda?
What you doing, Gail?
Have a real drink,
- or you'll make me look bad.
- I am.
You girls did a real nice job.
Mary Margaret would be proud.
- That means a lot, Mrs. Burke.
- So, Mary Beth,
UMaine next fall?
Oh.
Well, yeah, God, I hope so.
I mean, I'm already
a year behind.
UMaine has the hottest boys.
Oh, Lord.
Remember Mary Margaret
wore these to Kate's wedding?
And her nice dress.
And when we asked,
she looked down and said,
- "They're from Paris."
- Didn't miss a beat.
- Aw.
- Yeah, I remember '89.
Yeah, three feet of water
in the basement.
Mary Margaret showed up
in those boots
at 1:00 a.m. with a sump pump.
She saved my tush, too.
More than a few times.
Oh, my.
Hell or high water,
your mother showed up
for all of us.
God rest her soul.
Now, I know you're feeling bad
about missing college
and losing the house,
but I'll tell you...
Later in life, you'll be glad
you put family first.
Hey. I'm in the weeds here.
Can you help me out
a little bit?
When were you
planning on telling me
we're losing the house?
I have to find out
after Doreen goddamn Burke?
Ma leveraged it, okay,
against a loan for the shop.
She was behind on payments.
I was gonna tell you.
- Okay? I was.
- Bullshit.
- We can make it work. We can...
- I just...
- I... I can't.
- We can take shifts.
- It's...
- No, it's not my problem.
I... I'm done.
I'm out of here.
Typical Mary Beth.
I stayed, Pris.
I've stayed here
in this shitty town
in this shitty house
for a whole freaking year.
Well, Mom's dead now,
so you can leave.
Connolly.
- Hiya, Paulie.
- Get the hell out of here.
- Get out of here.
- Shut up.
How's work?
Hey, I'm off for a whole day,
so drink to that.
Oh, well,
you still reek of fish.
Oh, thank you.
Ah, ah. No, no.
Connolly, Connolly.
- What?
- Connolly, no, you owe me
from last time,
you cheap ass. No way.
Really? You're gonna ride my ass
the day of my mother's funeral?
Oh, kid, relax.
Just trying to cheer you up.
Sorry.
Go ahead and take two
while you're at it.
Live a little.
You're not from
around here, are you?
Easter Cove, born and raised.
How'd you end up
in this shithole?
Bad fucking luck, man.
You know what, though?
I just won the lottery.
Well, personally,
I'm on my way out of town.
Well, how about
a going-away party?
Mrs. Devlin?
- Oh, hi, Connolly.
- Hi.
Uh, thank you for the...
the flowers.
They're-they're lovely.
Uh, yeah, they weren't cheap.
Toodle-oo.
You scared me
for a second there.
Don't fuck with me like that,
you know.
Yeah, we might get some, uh,
troopers up here.
- We got some staties up here.
- Oh, man.
I got to be all responsible.
It's cold,
but it feels good out there!
You know, it feels pretty, uh...
it feels late.
I probably should be
getting home.
You're so fucking cute.
Watch it. Watch it!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let's go.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go before the cops come.
Let's go.
Okay.
We got some souvenirs.
Nice fucking driving.
Shit.
It's just, you know,
my fishing knickknacks.
- There was blood.
- Hey.
Get off of me.
Stop. Let's-let's just stop
for a second.
No, will you get off of me?
Get off!
- Get off! Get...
- Hey, hey.
Let go!
Get... the fuck off of me!
H-Hey, hey, hey.
What's the plan?
I want to go home.
Oh, what did you
think that you saw?
Come here.
Huh?!
You're gonna wake up
all my neighbors, you know?
Well, stay the fuck
away from me.
Hello?
Where are you?
Where are you, you fucking cunt?
Motherfucking cunt.
Pris?
Can you start over?
I'm confused.
It was confusing.
But you had to do it, right?
You... Mary Beth,
you had to do it, right?
I don't know.
What do you mean,
you don't know?
I lost control with...
the brick.
Brick?
You said it was a harpoon.
Oh, shit, I'm so screwed.
Mary Beth, you said
it was a harpoon.
Are you gonna call the police?
Easter Cove PD.
Get dressed.
Okay.
You ready?
We got to lift him together.
One, two, three.
Pris, I can't. Fuck.
Coleslaw.
What?
Mrs. Egan's coleslaw.
The whitest, goopiest shit ever.
I hate coleslaw.
Yeah, but when
Adam what's-his-name
called you a pussy,
you ate the whole thing.
And you licked the spoon even.
It was disgusting.
But you got it down, didn't you?
Okay.
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.
Shit.
- Push.
- I don't know if he's gonna fit.
It'll fit.
The knees, though...
Can't bend enough.
Should we take his shoes off?
No.
- No, push the top down.
- Oops.
Shit.
Just push it in.
- Oh, my God.
- Damn it!
We should have just
called the police.
Don't.
I mean, what are we
supposed to do, Pris?
Just chop his arms off?
Fucking coleslaw.
Ready?
On the count of three.
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.
Morning, Coletti.
Morning, Justin.
Or should I say Officer Brennan?
Morning, ladies.
How's the day looking?
Not good for Cap'n Dick.
Better get to work.
Hey, take it easy on my protégé.
I'll have to take you in.
What a flirt.
Lord help us.
Think she's
on her way to church?
Oh, yeah!
Oh, fuck.
Holy shit.
Holy shit, it's freezing. Fuck.
You're gonna catch a cold.
Didn't I buy you stockings?
Fucking waited for Gorski.
And called his cell.
No-show.
You walk home looking like that?
Anyone see you?
I mean, just some old ladies.
Oh, great.
Geez, Enid.
Ever think about redecorating?
You're, like, way overdue
for a makeover.
None of your business,
Martha Stewart.
I'm just saying, like,
treat yourself.
Hey.
I took out the trash.
I did the laundry.
I bleached the tub.
We're gonna get caught.
Why?
I can't find the knife.
It says "Connolly Fish" on it.
Did you see me pick it up?
Mm, no, but, I mean,
we were really careful.
Yeah, well, not careful enough.
If Mom knew about this...
Okay, Pris,
just calm down, damn it.
- What are we gonna do?
- Uh...
Hello?
- I'll go... I'll go get it.
- Anyone here?
- Okay. Y-You stay.
- Okay.
- I'll go.
- Okay. Hello?
Mm, uh...
Priscilla Connolly?
Officer Coletti sent me here.
You-you have a...
a small skiff, right?
Yeah.
Think we could borrow it?
Sorry, we're just...
we're in a real squeeze.
We're just looking
for a Good Samaritan.
Chilly.
You guys had this boat
in the family for a while?
- Sorry, Officer.
- Oh.
Please, uh, call me Justin.
Um, Justin Brennan.
We went to County High together.
Your sister, she used to
prank-call my buddy Paulie
all-all the time.
It drove him nuts.
Uh...
J-Just so you know,
it-it could get a little grody.
H-How do you mean?
A body washed up on the rocks.
Um, we can't get it from shore,
and we can't get it
with the big boats, so, uh,
this little guy
is the best tool for the job.
Oh, you-you ran the food drive
at Thanksgiving, yeah?
Uh, your-your posters worked,
so you know.
I-I brought ten cans
of Chef Boyardee.
Filled up the... grocery bags.
Our chariot arrives!
Watch your step.
All right. Come on, Brennan.
I know she's cute.
- You're not coming?
- Oh, no.
Not with my knees.
I'll stay here
with your girlfriend.
All right.
Enid's business is
bringing shame to the town.
It's bringing shame to us.
Well, Mary Margaret
assured us that all we...
Mary Margaret's not here, Suze.
It's now between us and Enid.
I can't turn
a blind eye anymore.
Can you?
I dropped my fork.
Oh, sure, hon.
How the Pats doing, Bob?
They're not giving Brady
any protection.
They're playing like
a bunch of nuns. Thank you.
Enid's crossed a line,
and something needs to change.
Mary Margaret was
a loyal friend,
God rest her soul,
but she's not here
to defend Enid anymore.
And even if she was,
I'd like to think
Mary Margaret would agree.
Oceanview has run its course.
Hello, Rayleen.
How's Kimmie?
I want to see
those prom pictures.
Four more minutes, hon.
Hi, Julie.
Hi, Enid.
Gail, Doreen, Suze, hello.
Paul Mitchell. Huh.
- Fancy.
- I get it. I get it.
You saw one of my girls
walking home
looking like
a lady of the night.
My guy's M.I.A.
Won't happen again.
No, Enid, no.
A young woman was found dead
in the harbor.
Bullet wound, track marks.
And we know she worked
at Oceanview.
We've been asking ourselves,
who could have done this?
What is this, the Inquisition?
Enid, do you ever
think about retiring?
We were just thinking about
some sort of travel club
together.
Go to Boca Raton,
drink mai tais,
get an Irish tan.
Not ready to go
full vegetable yet, Suze.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You want to shut down
my business?
No, just adjust.
I can help you spruce up
the B and B,
clean things up, you know.
Boy, you didn't waste any time.
Mary Margaret's been in the
grave what, not even a day?
Don't try and pull
the Mary Margaret card here.
- Now, she was a real friend.
- Too bad you were too busy
to visit her in the hospital
or attend the funeral.
But it must be hard
for you to step foot
- in a church.
- Careful, Gail.
You're making
your frown lines worse.
- Enid.
- No, Dor.
You come in here telling me
one of my dearest girls
is dead, and I'm a little upset.
Oh, you know which girl?
I pay Rayleen good money
for a cut and color
and some much needed
peace and quiet.
So kindly get on
with your afternoon
of casseroles and crochet,
'cause when I leave here,
I-I have a goddamn
business to run.
I saw your car.
Gorski!
Geez, you're making me look bad!
Whew.
Fuck it.
I'll take a whiskey, please...
Top shelf.
Connolly girl.
I used to pal around
with your mother.
I-I know, Mrs. Devlin.
One of the only gals had
her head screwed on straight.
You girls holding down
the shop all right?
Well, yeah.
I mean, me?
I'm onto bigger
and better things.
You know, I want to travel or...
at least get the hell out
of Easter Cove.
Think she'll send us a postcard?
Keep the change, Mary.
I'll see you later, Ms. Devlin.
Come on in!
Are you looking for Raymond?
Sorry, I think I got
the wrong place.
Hold on. We'll pay you.
W-We just want to talk is all.
Have you been
working the docks for long?
Suze.
They call it "The Desert."
Oh, you're just so hip, Gail.
You still don't know
how to text.
Couple years.
It's such a shame
about that poor girl.
Do you know how this
could've happened?
Yeah, it's pretty fucked-up.
Like, who drowns?
Dear, your friend was killed
before she made it
into the water.
She didn't drown.
She was shot.
Dee was shot?
Do you think Enid was involved?
What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?
I mean...
she has you working today
after what happened?
We're worried about you girls.
Why don't you mind
your own fucking business?
- Honey, we just want to help.
- We want justice for Dee.
As far as all youse
are concerned,
I'm only good for a screw.
You don't want a screw,
eat my fucking ass.
Um... hmm.
Anybody home?
Where is everybody?
It's usually more festive,
I'll tell you.
The atmosphere
of this place alone.
I dare you not to love it.
- Of course, under the circumstances...
- Yeah.
Hey, daddy.
I missed you.
They talk to everybody
like that.
You thirsty?
It's cocktail o'clock.
Come on in and wet your cock.
The usual? Jack and Coke?
You want a two-for-one?
The fun's in here.
Don't be weird.
Oh, my God.
Come on.
I know you got some guns
under there.
Yeah?
- All cops like to work out.
- Okay.
Enid, tell your girls
to take it easy on him.
- He's a good Catholic boy.
- Aw.
Um, Ms. Devlin, can you tell us
about the last time
you saw Dee McAnniff?
Tanya, uh, go watch TV.
I TiVo'd some Buffy.
All right.
Tragic thing.
I try to protect these girls,
but I can't do everything.
I think she may have been
too wrapped up with the drugs.
It's a shame.
Um...
would you mind telling us
how long she was using?
Not in my department, honey.
But it's not the worst lead.
Enid, what about this fella
that manages for you?
Weirdo, not from Easter Cove.
Gorski.
Well, he's a harmless sap.
Do you know where he lives?
Afraid not.
But if Gorski had anything
to do with this,
I'd never forgive myself for
bringing him into this house.
Oh...
Thank you for looking
into this, Coletti.
You're a good man.
Ooh, boy, what a woman.
Enid Nora Devlin.
She was hot shit
back in the day.
Yeah, well... she didn't seem
too upset, though.
You know, and she didn't give us
a whole lot to work on, either.
You have eyes, my child,
but you cannot see.
She didn't say his name,
but she was definitely
pointing me
toward Declan Crawley.
Declan Crawley, that's the...
that's the guy
that runs The Desert?
Yeah, a lot of stuff
goes in and out of there,
if you know what I mean.
Hiya, Pris.
I just fixed this.
Priscilla?
We can't afford to deal with
this made-in-China
piece of garbage.
- Uh, Pris?
- Did you find it?
Uh... the knife?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yes, I found it.
I threw it off Kernwood Bridge.
Okay.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
I, uh...
I thought it was gonna
be him in the water.
What?
Hey, Declan.
I come bearing gifts.
How the hell are...
You make a better door
than a window.
We won't take up
much of your time.
Just need to ask you
about this Gorski fella.
No jelly.
Well, there should be.
Mr. Crawley.
You're Tim Crawley's dad,
aren't you?
Uh, I tell you,
I-I'll never forget
that Thanksgiving game
my senior year.
You want to talk
about a Hail Mary.
Nobody thought
he would catch that one.
Yeah, unbelievable play.
You played with Timbo?
I ran the scoreboard.
Uh, listen, Mr. Crawley,
if you got any information
about Gorski, we'd be happy
to get out of your hair,
- let you watch your game here.
- Well, did you go by his place?
You got an address?
Yeah, Enid had me open up
an old shack.
Far end of Marsh Lane.
Enid.
Hey, give me a call
when you find him.
Hell, he's up and vanished
like a fart in the wind.
How are you?
I'm on break, Officer.
Talk to Tanya.
Hey, sorry to bother you.
You seemed upset
at the Oceanview.
Were you close with Dee?
You happen to know
where she was from
or how she ended up there?
Hey, look, I'm just trying
to find whoever did this
before they can do it
to someone else, all right?
Yeah, her family's
in Lowell, Mass.
But she was living in Lynn
when Gorski picked her up.
And, uh, Gorski...
Did he pick you up, too?
Did Dee owe anyone money?
People owed her
fucking money, guy.
What people?
- Your fucking mother.
- Okay.
Please, was there anyone
who was upset with her?
Any-Any-Anyone who wanted
to cause her harm?
Brennan.
You bastard.
I love that sexy cop outfit.
Where's your stripper pole?
Jesus, Paulie, I'm trying
to fucking work here.
Okay. Okay. Rough day?
Yeah...
Yeah, just...
a little cold is all.
It's just me, honey.
I'm just returning your jacket.
We're here if you want to talk.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Lexie.
I love you so much.
You know that?
Wish you'd pick up your phone.
Chowder from Gurnet's.
Better than anything
you can cook.
Thank you.
Here we go.
- I can help.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'll get that.
- Are you sure?
Ah!
I remember these.
Your mother used to slip
a flask in the side
and sneak booze out of
your grandad's cabinet.
That doesn't sound like Ma.
Ah, she was the worst,
your mother.
But we never got caught.
For anything.
A lot of people
underestimate young women.
That's why they can get away
with a lot.
We had a good run,
your mother and I.
Made a lot of money, too.
She was a natural businesswoman.
You worked at the fish shop?
Do these look like
fishmonger hands to you, dear?
Uh, given that your mother
and I go way back,
I want you girls to know that...
if anything ever happened,
you can come to me.
I've seen it all,
and I won't judge.
Connollys.
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.
Um, can we have a minute?
Sure.
Enid said she and our mother
made a lot of money together.
What did she mean by that?
What you girls
need to understand
is that it used to be
real bad around here.
It's a small town,
but it's also a port.
A lot of men came through.
Not all of them were nice.
So, when Enid said
she wanted to start Oceanview,
we all, including your mother,
supported her.
By starting a whorehouse?
By managing the situation.
In those days, we said,
"Boys will be boys.
If it's not Enid's girls,
then it's our own daughters."
We wanted something better
for you kids.
Awful nerve of Enid,
stirring things up with you two.
Enid's dangerous.
Stay away from her.
Ah, shit.
I forgot we're out of milk.
I just bought some.
No, it was bad.
I-I threw it out.
What do you mean,
you threw it out?
What, Pris? It had lumps in it.
- That's gross.
- Where's the carton?
They can't just sell us
bad milk, Mary Beth.
I took it out
this morning, Priscilla.
Goddamn it!
I mean, we're broke.
Who does
this to their own daughters?
I mean, this is so wrong.
That-that we don't have milk?
That she ran a whorehouse.
We did everything for her.
Made sure she was comfortable,
walked her around the house
with that fucking pillow,
made her goddamn soup.
Oh, took her to church
for her holiness.
And how does she thank us, huh?
She leaves us with no savings...
- Pris.
- A shitty business,
funeral bills, hospital bills
- and a house we can't afford.
- Pris.
What?
Someone's gonna miss this.
Yeah.
But he's dead.
Well, I think we found out
who plowed into old Cap'n Dick.
- There's guns in here.
- Okay. You sure about that?
All right. Yeah, thanks.
All right, I got to run.
I'll bet you a Caramel
Frappuccino the bullet matches.
Yeah, but why would he leave
the tarps in the trunk?
And-and if you're gonna
skip town,
wouldn't you take
the gun with you?
Or y-you dump it off somewhere?
Either way,
all roads lead to Gorski.
Yeah, but Enid lied to us
about knowing his address.
So says Declan.
Hey, you know what?
I-I don't understand...
Why are you always
giving her a free pass?
Hey, Agatha Christie,
how about you stop telling me
how to do my job, huh?
Come in.
You can keep me company.
Have some if you like.
- Ow, it's hot.
- Blow on it first.
Mm.
They're saying bad things
about you.
Who's saying bad things?
I don't know. Some old ladies.
What kind of bad things?
That Dee...
That, um...
that maybe you hurt Dee.
And do you believe them?
No.
I mean, I don't think so.
Let me ask you something.
Who... who helped you out
when you had nothing?
No, you did.
No, I know, I know.
You did.
I...
I feel like such a fool.
I had no idea
Gorski was such a monster.
Wait.
What... Gorski killed Dee?
He's a sick man.
What can I say?
I gave him a little bit
of authority,
and he seemed to take it
as a free ticket
to do what he wanted.
Oh, my God.
But Dee, honey...
she begged me to give her
the queen's treatment.
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but that girl was ready
to sell you down the river
at the drop of a hat
if it meant she could have
- a bigger slice of pie.
- No, but Dee and I...
Dee and I were like sisters.
- Come on.
- Wake up, cupcake.
She was only ever
looking out for herself.
It was a sad realization
for me, too,
after all I'd done for her.
Enid, you fucking
owed her money.
Dee was a selfish,
ungrateful junkie
who was always skimming
off the top.
Not an ounce of loyalty
in that girl.
And you know what?
I'm still here for you,
aren't I?
Come here.
Yeah.
What are you doing here, anyway?
Why aren't you at The Desert?
Declan kicked us out.
He said you didn't pay
this month.
Gail and Doreen
put you up to this?!
Whoa, Enid, calm down.
You're not so pretty
when you're mad.
30 years of business,
and I don't get
the benefit of the doubt?!
Just pay me what you owe me,
and your girls go back to work.
You scared me.
Your mom still hide whiskey
around here?
Uh, I doubt it.
Uh, is there something I could
help you with, Mrs. Devlin?
Ms. Devlin.
Hi, Pris.
Don't hate me, but I splurged.
Bingo.
Aged to perfection.
I was about your age
when I inherited the B and B.
When some fishermen started
bringing this girl
to Oceanview
for hourly services,
I was furious.
But your mother had the idea
to actually talk to the girl.
See if we could all find a way
to capitalize.
And we did.
Go on, drink up.
Drink up.
You know why I'm here?
The sad truth is
I'm disappointed in you girls.
You thought you could hustle me.
Mrs. Devlin, we...
But because of your mother,
I'm giving you a second chance
to make this right.
You're going to bring me back
what you stole.
And I'll return...
that fancy knife of yours.
And if you don't,
there are two things I can do.
And the nice one
is to turn you in.
See you tonight.
Pris!
Okay, Priscilla, just...
wait one minute.
Priscilla, just slow down.
How does she have the knife
if you dropped it
off Kernwood Bridge?
Well, you were freaking out.
You lied to me.
I needed to calm you down.
- I'm going to the police.
- Look.
Why don't we just bring
that bitch back her money?
You heard Gail.
She said stay the hell away.
- That girl was killed.
- I know.
- She worked for Enid, Mary Beth.
- I know, but-but...
No, if you saw what I saw...
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean that...
Where's the money?
I'm not a criminal.
I can't live like this.
So then let's just leave.
We could take this money.
It's $50,000.
We could get out
of this dump, Pris.
This town, this house...
It's all pathetic.
If you leave with that money,
I'm done.
I mean, really,
you're on your own.
No one to clean up your mess.
Do you get that if we-we go
and we turn ourselves in,
then-then our lives are over?
Mary Beth, grow up.
Hi.
Thanks.
I'll go tomorrow.
Go to the police...
and I'll tell them everything.
That's what Mom would've wanted.
Hey there, Priscilla.
Mary Beth.
Officer Brennan.
"Officer Brennan" still, eh?
Well, better than "sir."
I'll take it.
Wow.
Smells delish in there.
Is that haddock?
Geez. Smells good.
Sorry, um, stomach's talking.
Oh, uh, did you...
Would you...
Do you want to join us?
Uh, yeah.
I won't say no to a good meal.
Sure. Thanks.
Bless us, O Lord,
and these thy gifts,
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty
through Christ our Lord. Amen.
All right.
I, um...
Sorry to hear about your mom.
Um, just wanted to say that.
Um, funeral was Saturday, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
And was everything okay
with you two, um...
here alone that night?
- Uh, well...
- Everything was fine.
We, uh... we went to bed early.
Okay.
It's just, uh...
Sorry. The reason I ask is, uh,
the station actually got a call
from this residence,
um, pretty late
on Saturday night, so...
Did you girls see
anything unusual?
Oh.
You know, that was me.
I-I remember now.
I-I pressed the wrong preset.
How'd you do that?
Oh, um...
our Uncle Henry got
really drunk,
and, uh...
I just was trying to call
to see if he got home okay,
and, um, I was trying
to press the, uh,
assisted living, um, preset.
- Fumbling fingers.
- Yeah.
- And, uh, w-was he okay?
- Oh, yeah. He, uh...
I think he got
a new girlfriend that night.
Okay.
Quite the scoundrel, then, huh?
Um, well, so, uh...
so, if I had to note it
for the, um, official record,
you guys were here
all Saturday night
after the reception?
Yeah. We were here together.
All night.
Oh, uh...
St. Joan's soup kitchen.
On volunteer day.
I do remember you.
Well, bye, Justin.
Yeah, bye.
I changed my mind.
Well, so what are we
gonna do now?
We give the bitch back
her money.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Lexie.
I love you so much.
You know that?
Wish you'd pick up your phone.
I did something, Lexie.
I cracked it.
It was Enid's birthday.
We are done taking shit.
October 17...
1951.
Happy birthday, Enid.
Come in, sweetheart.
Come in.
I know Enid's lying to me.
She hurt my friend.
I'd like another one
for the road.
Enid, I think
you've had enough for tonight.
Why don't you get yourself home?
Isn't that...
isn't-isn't that cute?
Cut the shit and get to pouring.
The older one, Priscilla?
- Mm-hmm?
- Her hair is different,
but it's... yeah, she's just...
she's still really pretty.
Work that uniform.
The Catholic girls
love that shit.
You know her younger sister.
What about her?
Oh, she's a hot shit,
but a waste of time.
She likes the creeps.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I don't get that.
Why do girls like dicks?
Oh, not even just a dick;
Like, a dirtbag.
She was all over that Oceanview
creeper in here the other night.
Paulie, what, uh...
what night was that?
It was, uh, Saturday.
- Saturday, huh?
- Yeah.
Well, shit.
I need this
like a hole in the head.
We know you killed
that girl, Enid.
You need to turn yourself in.
We want to help you.
Y-You're like family.
Cut the bullshit, Suze.
You hens decided to hate me
years ago.
You didn't play
by the rules, Enid.
That's right. I didn't have
a kid to parade around
or a cake at
the goddamn bake sale.
Not those kind of rules, Enid.
What, this?
This place we all
decided on together,
that we all said yes to?
- You convinced us then.
- Bullshit.
We all remember how bad it was.
We all have stories, so...
don't treat me like
I was asking for trouble.
It changed, Enid.
- The whole operation.
- Admit it, Gail.
You never had a problem
with this place
until you caught Bruce
coming by.
Maybe.
But you, Enid...
you need to take
a good look in the mirror.
The devil herself.
It-it's not right, Enid.
They're not our girls, but
they're somebody's daughters.
That poor thing
didn't deserve to die.
Dee?
You all used her.
You all benefited from her
and so many others.
And God knows how we can
ever forgive ourselves.
But we're trying
to do right now.
It's over, Enid.
If you can't see that,
we can't help you.
Toodle-oo.
Catty bitches.
We'll take the back door.
And the boat.
Mrs. Devlin?
Um, Mrs. Devlin?
Saying,
um, "Danielle's mom sold me"
an effin' fake ticket,"
and she's, like, going on and on
with all these
inappropriate texts.
Let-let me ask you something.
Here's the money.
We had to use some,
but, uh, we'll pay you back.
We swear.
And I was like, "My mom's here."
She can go get your ticket..."
God, I miss your mother.
I never said goodbye.
I'm sure she hated me.
She wasn't angry.
I think she understood.
She was a good egg, your mother.
Did everything for you girls.
Left the business 'cause of you.
I don't hold it
against you, though.
Well, we won't be
bothering you from now on.
Tell that to Gorski.
We'd like our knife back.
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
The knife.
On second thought,
I think you should keep
some of this money.
I know you need it.
Buy a f-few nice things.
Wouldn't hurt.
And when that money's gone,
you can come to work for me.
On the business side, of course.
We can't accept this.
Don't be stupid.
Pris is right.
We don't want your money.
I don't like your tone.
You brats have no idea
how easy you have it.
We were on our own.
No one was looking out for us.
But you girls, you grew up
spoiled fucking rotten!
And now you want to act
all high and mighty?
Look down on me? Judge me?
Judge my life?
- Mrs. Devlin...
- Ms. Devlin!
You should be on your knees
thanking me!
Here.
Yeah.
I can't. Stop it.
We're taking our knife back,
Ms. Devlin.
- Morning.
- Morning, Coletti.
I'm here to talk to you
about Oceanview.
Nan, what do you, uh...
what do you know
about the Connolly sisters?
You knew their mother, right?
Real nice girls.
Sure about that?
Yeah, Mary Margaret and I
go way back.
Well, they're acting strange.
Oh, honey.
I think someone has a crush.
Have you seen how cute
you look in your uniform?
Okay. Sure, Nan.
I'm proud of you, Justy.
- Working so hard.
- Mm.
Well, and Coletti's
a great teacher.
That guy confounds me.
Just overnight, out of the blue,
pulls a 180 on this murder case.
Murder? I thought she drowned.
And he's demanding
that I go with him
to make an arrest
at the crack of dawn.
I don't know.
Whoever changed his mind
must be pretty convincing, Nan.
Yeah, I'll bet he's got
reliable sources.
Still dredging the bay
for Gorski's body, right?
After we bust the Oceanview?
What's the point?
Mm.
Hey, there's your girl.
Let's do a drive-by.
Nah.
I don't like her anymore.
I guess now it's time
we got to get back to work.
Pris, I figure,
if we bust our asses,
we could probably
keep the house.
The house is just a house.
We got to get you
to college next fall.
What about you?
I like it here.
I'll come visit you, though.
Hello, Connollys.
Hey, Mrs. Maguire.
Priscilla, Mary Beth.
Morning, Mrs. Burke.
