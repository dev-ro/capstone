"Sing no more ditties,"
More!
"Sing no more,
Of dumps so dull and heavy,
The fraud of men was ever so,
Since summer. . .
first was leafy.
Then sigh not so,
But let them go,
And be you blithe. . .
and bonny,
Converting all . . .
your sounds of woe,
Into Hey. . .
nonny, nonny !''
My lord.
I learn in this letter. . .
that Don Pedro of Aragon. . .
comes this night to Messina !
He is very near by this.
He was not three leagues off
when l left him.
How many gentlemen
have you lost in this action ?
But few of any sort, and none of name.
I find here that Don Pedro
hath bestowed much honor. . .
on a young Florentine
called Claudio.
He hath borne himself. . .
beyond the promise of his age,
doing in the figure of a lamb,
the feats of a lion !
Is Signior Mountanto
returned from the wars or no ?
I know not that name, lady.
My cousin means
Signior Benedick of Padua.
O, he's returned;
and as pleasant as ever he was.
I pray you, how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars ?
But how many hath he killed ?
For indeed l promised to eat
all of his killing.
He hath done good service.
And a good soldier too, lady.
And a good soldier to a lady.
But what is he to a lord ?
A lord to a lord, a man to a man;
stuffed with all honorable virtues.
It is so, indeed:
he is no less than a stuffed man.
You must not, sir,
mistake my niece.
There is a kind of merry war
betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
they never meet but there's a skirmish
of wit between them.
Who is his companion now ?
He hath every month
a new sworn brother.
He is most in the company
of the right noble Claudio.
Oh, Lord !
He will hang upon him like a disease.
He is sooner caught than the pestilence,
and the taker runs presently mad !
God help the noble Claudio !
If he have caught the Benedick,
it will cost him a thousand pounds
ere a' be cured.
I will keep friends with you, lady.
Do, good friend.
You will never run mad, niece.
No, not till a hot January.
Don Pedro is approaching !
Good Signior Leonato,
are you come to meet your trouble ?
The fashion of the world
is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.
Never came trouble to my house
in the likeness of Your Grace.
My lord.
I think this is your daughter.
Her mother hath many times
told me so.
Were you in doubt, sir,
that you asked her ?
Signior Benedick, no !
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
have his head on her shoulders. . .
for all Messina,
as like him as she is.
I wonder that you will still
be talking, Signior Benedick. Nobody marks you.
What, my dear Lady Disdain !
Are you yet living ?
Is it possible Disdain should die. . .
while she hath such meet food
to feed it as Signior Benedick ?
Courtesy itself must convert to Disdain
if you come in her presence.
Then is Courtesy a turncoat.
But it is certain l am loved of all ladies,
only you excepted;
and l would l could find in my heart that l had not
a hard heart; for truly, l love none.
A dear happiness to women: they would
else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.
I thank God and my cold blood,
l am of your humour for that.
I had rather hear my dog
bark at a crow. . .
than a man swear he loves me.
God keep your ladyship in that mind . . .
so some gentlemen or other shall 'scape
a pre-destinate scratched face.
Scratching could not make it worse
an 't such a face as yours were.
Well, you are a rare parrot teacher.
A bird of my tongue
is better than a beast of yours.
I would my horse had the speed
of your tongue ! But. . .
keep you away, i' God 's name.
I have done.
You always end with a jade's trick.
I know you of old.
Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick,
my dear friend Leonato
hath invited you all.
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month.
Let me bid you welcome, my lord:
being reconciled to the prince
your brother,
I owe you all duty.
I thank you.
I am not of many words,
but l thank you.
Please it Your Grace lead on ?
Your hand, Leonato;
we will go together.
Benedick,
didst thou note the daughter
of Signior Leonato ?
I noted her not,
but l looked on her.
Is she not a modest young lady ?
Do you question me for my simple,
true judgment ?
Or would you have me speak after
my custom, as a tyrant to their sex ?
No; I pray thee, speak
in sober judgment.
Why, i' faith, methinks
she's too low for a high praise,
too brown for a fair praise,
and too little for a great praise.
Only this commendation
l can afford her,
That were she other than she is,
she were unhandsome;
and being no other than as she is,
l do not like her.
Thou thinkest l am in sport.
I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.
Would you buy her
that you inquire after her ?
Can the world buy such a jewel ?
Yea, and a case to put it into.
But speak you this
with a sad brow ?
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady
that ever l looked on.
I can see yet without spectacles
and l see no such matter.
There's her cousin,
and she were not possessed
with a Fury, exceeds her. . .
as much in beauty as the first of May
doth the last of December.
But l hope you have no intent
to turn husband, have you ?
I would scarce trust myself,
though l had sworn the contrary,
if Hero would be my wife.
Is't come to this ? Shall l never see
a bachelor of threescore again ?
Gentlemen,
what secret hath held you here
that you followed not to Leonato's ?
He is "in love".
'With who ?'
That is Your Grace's part.
With Hero, Leonato's short daughter.
Amen if you love her;
for the lady is very well worthy.
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
By my troth,
l speak my thought.
And in faith, my lord,
l spoke mine.
And, by my two faiths and troths,
my lord, l spoke mine.
- That l love her, l feel.
- That she is worthy, l know.
That l neither feel how she should be loved
nor know how she should be worthy,
is the opinion that fire cannot melt
out of me.
I will die in it at the stake.
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic
in the despite of beauty.
That a woman conceived me,
l thank her;
that she brought me up,
l likewise give her most humble thanks.
But that l will hang my bugle
in an invisible baldric,
all women shall pardon me.
I will live a bachelor.
I shall see thee, ere l die,
look pale with love.
With anger, with sickness or with hunger,
my lord. Not with love.
Well, as time shall try !
"In time the savage bull
doth bear the yoke."
The savage bull may;
but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,
pluck off the bull's horns
and set them in my forehead !
And let me be vilely painted
and in such great letters as they write !
''Here is good horse to hire."
Let them signify under my sign "here you may
see Benedick the married man.''
Benedick, repair to Leonato's:
tell him l will not fail him at supper;
for indeed he hath made great preparation.
Examine your conscience.
And so l leave you.
Hath Leonato any son, my lord ?
No child but Hero,
she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio ?
O, my lord, when you went onward
on this ended action,
I looked upon her with a soldier's eye,
that liked,
but had a rougher task in hand than to drive
liking to the name of love.
But now. . .
I am returned and that war thoughts
have left their places vacant,
in their rooms come thronging soft. . .
and delicate desires,
all prompting me
how fair young Hero is.
Saying. . .
I liked her ere l went to wars.
Thou wilt be like a lover presently and
tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero,
cherish it,
and I will break with her and with
her father and thou shalt have her.
I know we shall have revelling tonight.
I will assume thy part in some disguise
and tell fair Hero l am Claudio,
and in her bosom
l 'll unclasp my heart. . .
and take her hearing prisoner with the
force and strong encounter of my amorous tale;
then after to her father
will l break;
and the conclusion is,
she shall be thine !
In practise let us put it presently.
What the good year, my lord ?
Why are you thus out of measure sad ?
There is no measure
in the occasion that breeds;
therefore the sadness is without limit.
You should hear reason.
And when I have heard it,
what blessing brings it ?
I cannot hide what l am.
I must be sad when l have cause
and smile at no man's jests;
eat when l have stomach
and wait for no man's leisure;
sleep when l am drowsy
and tend on no man's business;
Iaugh when l am merry. . .
and claw no man in his humor.
Yea, but you must not
make the full show of this. . .
till you may do so
without controlment.
You have of late stood out
against your brother,
and he hath ta'en you newly
into his grace,
where it is impossible
you should take true root. . .
but by the fair weather
that you make yourself.
I had rather be a canker
in a hedge. . .
than a rose in his grace.
In this, though l cannot be said
to be a flattering honest man,
it must not be denied
but l am a plain-dealing villain !
If l had my mouth,
I would bite;
if l had my liberty,
l would do my liking.
In the meantime
let me be that l am . . .
and seek not to alter me.
Borachio, what news ?
I can give you intelligence
of an intended marriage.
Will it serve for any model
to build mischief on ?
Marry, it is
your brother's right hand.
The most exquisite Claudio ?
- Even he.
- How came you to this ?
I heard it agreed upon. . .
that the prince
should woo Hero for himself,
and having obtained her,
give her to Count Claudio.
Come, come, let us thither.
This may prove food to my displeasure.
That young start-up
hath all the glory of my overthrow.
If l can cross him any way,
I bless myself every way.
You are both sure,
and will assist me ?
To the death, my lord.
Shall we go prove
what's to be done ?
We'll wait upon your lordship.
- Was not Count John here at supper ?
- I saw him not.
How tartly that gentleman looks ! I never can see
him but l am heart-burned an hour after.
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
He were an excellent man. . .
that were made just in the midway
between him and Benedick.
The one is too like an image
and says nothing,
and the other too like my lady's
eldest son, evermore tattling.
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue. . .
in Count John's mouth,
and half Count John's melancholy
in Signior Benedick's face.
With a good leg. . .
and a good foot, Uncle,
and money enough in his purse,
such a man would win any woman in the
world if he could get her goodwill.
By my troth, niece,
thou wilt never get thee a husband,
if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
Lord, l could not endure a husband with
a beard on his face. I had rather lie in the woollen.
You may light on a husband
that hath no beard.
What should l do with him ?
Dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman ?
He that hath a beard
is more than a youth,
and he that hath no beard
is less than a man.
And he that is more than a youth
is not for me,
and he that is less than a man,
I am not for him.
In faith, she's too curst.
Well, then, go you into hell ?
No, but to the gate;
and there will the devil meet me
like an old cuckold . . .
with horns on his head,
and saying. . .
''Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven;
here's no place for you maids.''
So, away to Saint Peter for the heavens;
he shows me where the bachelors sit,
and there live we
as merry as the day is long.
Well, niece. l hope you will
be ruled by your father.
Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty
to make curtsy and say,
''Father, as it please you,''
but yet for all that, cousin,
Iet him be a handsome fellow.
Or else make another curtsy and say,
''Father, as it please me.''
Daughter, remember what l told you:
if the prince do solicit you
in that kind,
you know your answer.
Well, niece. l hope to see you
one day fitted with a husband.
Not till God make men. . .
of some other metal than earth.
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
I have a good eye, Uncle;
I can see a church by daylight.
The revellers are entering !
Lady, will you walk about
with your friend ?
I know you well enough;
you are Signior Antonio.
At a word, l am not.
I know you by the waggling
of your head.
- At a word, l am not !
- Come, come,
do you think l do not know you
by your excellent wit ?
Can virtue hide itself ?
Go to, mum, you are he:
graces will appear,
and there's an end.
...Well, l would you did like me.
So would not l,
for l have many ill qualities.
- Which is one ?
- I say my prayers aloud.
Will you not tell me who told you so ?
No, you shall pardon me.
- Nor will you not tell me who you are ?
- Not now.
That l was disdainful,
and that l had my good wit
out of the ''Hundred Merry Tales''
well, this was Signior Benedick that said so.
What's he ?
I 'm sure you know him well enough.
Not l, believe me.
- Did he never make you laugh ?
- I pray you. . .
what is he ?
Why, he is the prince's jester.
A very dull fool.
His only gift is in devising
impossible slanders.
None but libertines delight in him;
for he both pleases men and angers them,
and then they laugh at him
and beat him.
I am sure he is in the fleet.
I would he had boarded me.
When l know the gentleman,
l 'll tell him what you say.
Do,
Do.
- We must follow the leaders.
- In every good thing.
Are not you Signior Benedick ?
You know me well, I am he.
Signior, you are very near my brother
in his love:
he is enamored on Hero.
I pray you dissuade him from her:
she is no equal for his birth.
How know you he loves her ?
I heard him swear his affection.
So did l too; and he swore
he would marry her tonight.
Come, let us to the banquet.
Thus answer l in the name of Benedick,
but hear these ill news
with the ears of Claudio.
'Tis certain so:
the prince woos for himself !
Friendship is constant
in all other things. . .
save in the office and affairs
of love.
This is an accident of hourly proof,
which l mistrusted not.
Farewell, therefore, Hero !
Count Claudio ?
- Yea, the same.
- Come, will you go with me ?
- Whither ?
- About your own business.
The prince hath got your Hero !
I wish him joy of her !
Did you think that the prince
would have served you thus ?
I pray you, leave me !
Alas, poor hurt fowl.
But that my Lady Beatrice
should know me, and not know me !
The prince's fool ! Ha ?
I am not so reputed.
It is the base, though bitter, disposition
of Beatrice. . .
that puts the world into her person,
and so gives me out.
Well, l 'll be revenged as l may.
- Now, signior, where's the count ?
- Troth, my lord, l found him here. . .
as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.
I told him,
and l think l told him true,
that Your Grace had got the good will
of this young lady.
The Lady Beatrice
hath a quarrel to you.
The gentleman that danced with her
told her she is much wronged by you.
O, she misused me
past the endurance of a block !
She told me,
not thinking l had been myself,
that l was the prince's jester,
that l was duller than a great thaw,
huddling jest upon jest with such
impossible conveyance upon me. . .
that l stood like a man at a mark,
with a whole army shooting at me.
She speaks poniards,
and every word stabs.
If her breath were as terrible as her
terminations, there were no living near her;
she would infect to the North Star !
So, indeed, all disquiet,
horror, and perturbation follows her.
Look, here she comes.
Will Your Grace command me
any service to the world 's end ?
I will go on the slightest errand . . .
now to the Antipodes. . .
that you can devise to send me on.
I will fetch you a hair
off the Great Cham's beard,
do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
rather than hold three words' conference
with this harpy.
You have no employment for me ?
None, but to desire your good company !
O, God, sir,
here's a dish l love not.
I cannot endure my Lady Tongue !
Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart
of Signior Benedick.
Indeed, my lord,
he lent it me a while,
and l gave him use for it,
a double heart for his single one.
Marry, once before he won it of me,
with false dice,
therefore Your Grace may well say
l have lost it.
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
So l would not he should do me,
my lord,
Iest l should prove the mother of fools.
I have brought Count Claudio,
whom you sent me to seek.
Why, how now, Count,
wherefore are you sad ?
- Not sad, my lord.
- How then ? Sick ?
- Neither, my lord.
- The count is neither sad, nor sick,
nor merry, nor well,
but civil count,
civil as an orange,
and something of that jealous complexion.
In faith, lady, l think your blazon
to be true,
though l 'll be sworn, if he be so,
his conceit is false.
Here, Claudio,
I have wooed in thy name,
and fair Hero is won.
I have broke with her father
and his goodwill obtained.
Name the day of marriage,
and God give thee joy.
Count, take of me my daughter,
and with her my fortunes.
His Grace hath made the match,
and all grace say Amen to it.
Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.
I were but little happy
if l could say how much.
Lady,
as you are mine,
I am yours.
Speak, cousin !
Or, if you cannot,
stop his mouth with a kiss,
and let not him speak, neither.
In faith, lady,
you have a merry heart.
Yea, my lord, I thank it.
Poor fool, it keeps
on the windy side of care.
My cousin tells him in his ear
that he is in her heart.
And so she doth, cousin.
Good lord, for alliance !
Thus goes everyone to the world
but l,
and l am sunburnt.
I may sit in a corner
and cry "Heigh-ho for a husband."
Lady Beatrice,
l will get you one.
I would rather have one
of your father's getting.
Hath Your Grace ne'er a brother
like you ?
Your father got excellent husbands,
if a maid could come by them.
Will you have me, lady ?
No, my lord,
unless l might have another
for working days.
Your Grace is too costly
to wear every day.
But I beseech Your Grace, pardon me. I was born
to speak all mirth and no matter.
Your silence most offends me,
and to be merry best becomes you;
for out o' question,
you were born in a merry hour.
No, sure, my lord,
my mother cried.
But then there was a star danced,
and under that was l born.
Cousins,
God give you joy !
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
There's little of the melancholy element
in her, my lord.
She is never sad but when she sleeps,
and not ever then;
for l have heard my daughter say
she hath often dreamt of unhappiness. . .
and waked herself with laughing.
She cannot endure to hear tell
of a husband.
Oh, by no means.
She were an excellent wife
for Benedick.
If they were but a week married,
they would talk themselves mad.
County Claudio,
when mean you to go to church ?
- Tomorrow, my lord.
- Not till Monday, my dear son,
which is hence a just seven-night,
and a time too brief, too,
to have all things answer my mind.
I warrant thee, Claudio,
the time shall not go dully by us.
I will in the interim
undertake one of Hercules' labors,
which is to bring Signior Benedick
and the Lady Beatrice. . .
into a mountain of affection
the one with the other.
I would fain have it a match,
and l doubt not but to fashion it,
if you will but minister such assistance
as l shall give you direction.
My lord, l am for you, though it cost me
ten nights' watchings.
- And l, my lord.
- And you too, gentle Hero ?
I will do any modest office, my lord,
to help my cousin to a good husband.
If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer;
his glory shall be ours,
for we are the only love-gods.
Go with me,
and I will tell you my drift.
I do much wonder that one man,
seeing how much another man
is a fool . . .
when he dedicates his behaviors
to love,
will, after he hath laughed
at such shallow follies in others,
become the argument of his own scorn
by falling in love.
And such a man is Claudio.
I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife,
and now had he rather hear
the tabor and the pipe.
I have known when he would have walked
ten mile afoot to see a good armor,
and now will he lie ten nights awake
carving the fashion of a new doublet.
He was wont to speak plain and to
the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier,
and now is he turned orthography.
His words are
a very fantastical banquet,
just so many strange dishes.
Well, may l be so converted,
and see with these eyes ?
I cannot tell.
I think not.
I will not be sworn but love
may transform me to an oyster,
but l 'll take my oath on it,
till he have made an oyster of me,
he shall never make me such a fool.
One woman is fair, yet l am well.
Another is wise, yet l am well.
Another virtuous, yet l am well.
But till all graces be in one woman,
one woman shall not come in my grace.
Rich she shall be,
that's certain. Hmm.
Wise, or l 'll none.
Virtuous,
or l 'll never cheapen her.
Fair, or l 'll never look on her.
Mild, or come not near me.
Of good discourse,
an excellent musician.
And her hair shall be. . .
of what colour it please God.
Ha ! The prince and Monsieur Love.
I will hide me.
See you where Benedick hath hid himself ?
Very well, my lord.
Come, Balthasar,
we will hear that song again.
Hmm, now divine air !
Now is his soul ravished !
Is it not strange
that sheep's guts. . .
should hail souls out of men's bodies ?
Sigh no more, ladies,
Sigh no more
Men were deceivers ever,
One foot in sea,
And one on shore,
To one thing,
Constant never.
Then sigh not so,
But let them go,
And be you blithe
And bonny,
Converting all
Your sounds of woe
Into Hey
Nonny, nonny.
Sing no more ditties,
Sing no more,
Of dumps so dull and heavy;
The fraud of men
Was ever so,
Since summer
First was leafy,
Then sigh not so,
But let them go,
And be you blithe
And bonny,
Converting all
Your sounds of woe
Into Hey
Nonny, nonny.
By my troth, a good song.
And an ill singer, my lord.
No, no, faith; thou singest well enough.
And he had been a dog that should have
howled thus, they would have hanged him !
Come hither, Leonato.
What was it you told me of today,
that your niece Beatrice
was in love with Signior Benedick ?
I did never think that lady
would have loved any man.
No, nor l neither.
But most wonderful that she
should so dote on Signior Benedick,
whom she hath in all outward
behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
Is it possible ?
Maybe she doth but counterfeit ?
Faith, like enough.
O God ! Counterfeit ?
There was never
counterfeit of passion. . .
came so near the life of passion. . .
as she discovers it.
Why,
what effects of passion shows she ?
Bait the hook well.
This fish will bite.
What effects, my lord ?
- You heard my daughter tell you how.
- She did, indeed.
How, l pray you ?
You amaze me.
I should think this a trick,
but that the gray-bearded fellow
speaks it.
Hath she made her
affection known to Benedick ?
No, and swears she never will.
That's her torment.
She'll be up twenty times a night,
and there will she sit in her smock
till she have writ a sheet of paper.
Then down upon her knees she falls,
weeps, sobs, beats her heart,
tears her hair, curses,
''Oh, sweet Benedick,
God give me patience.''
She doth indeed,
my daughter says so.
My daughter is sometime afeared . . .
she will do
a desperate outrage to herself.
It is very true.
It were good that Benedick knew of it.
To what end ? He would make but a sport of it
and torment the poor lady worse.
I am sorry for her.
I pray you tell Benedick of it,
and hear what he will say.
- Were it good, think you ?
- Hero thinks surely she will die,
for she says she will die
if he love her not,
and she will die
ere she make her love known,
and she will die if he woo her.
If she should
make tender of her love,
'tis very possible he'll scorn it,
for the man, as you know all,
hath a contemptible spirit.
I love Benedick well,
and l could wish he would . . .
modestly examine himself, to see
how much he is unworthy. . .
so good a lady.
My lord, will you walk ?
Dinner is ready.
If he do not dote on her upon this,
l will never trust my expectation.
Let there be the same net spread for her, and that
must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry.
Let us send Beatrice
to call him in to dinner.
This can be no trick.
The conference was sadly borne.
They have the truth
of this from Hero.
Love me ?
Why ? It must be requited.
I hear how l am censured.
They say l will bear myself proudly
if l perceive the love come from her.
They say too
that she will rather die. . .
than give any sign of affection.
I did never think. . .
to marry.
I must not seem proud.
Happy are they that hear their
detractions and can put them to mending.
They say the lady is fair.
'Tis a truth, I can bear them witness.
And virtuous, 'tis so,
I cannot reprove it.
And wise,
but for loving me.
By my troth, it is
no addition to her wit,
nor no great argument
of her folly,
for l will be. . .
horribly in love with her.
I may chance have some odd quirks. . .
and remnants of wit broken on me. . .
because l have railed so long
against marriage;
but doth not the appetite alter ?
A man loves the meat in his youth
that he cannot endure in his age.
Shall these quips and sentences
and paper bullets of the brain. . .
awe a man from the career
of his humor ?
No.
The world must be peopled.
When l said l would die a bachelor,
I did not think l should live. . .
till l were married.
Here comes Beatrice !
By this day, she's a fair lady !
I do spy some. . .
marks of love in her.
Against my will l am sent
to bid you come in to dinner.
Fair Beatrice,
I thank you for your pains.
I took no more pains for those thanks
than you take pains to thank me.
If it had been painful
l would not have come.
You take pleasure, then,
in the message ?
Yea, just so much as you may take
upon a knife's point.
You have no stomach, signior ?
Fare you well.
''Against my will l am sent. . .
to bid you come in to dinner.''
There's a double meaning in that.
But are you sure that Benedick
loves Beatrice so entirely ?
So says the prince
and my new trothed lord.
And did they bid you
tell her of it, madam ?
They did entreat me
to acquaint her of it,
but l persuaded them,
if they loved Benedick,
to wish him wrestle with affection
and never to let Beatrice know of it.
Why did you so ?
Doth not the gentleman. . .
deserve as full as fortunate a bed
as ever Beatrice shall couch upon ?
O God of love !
I know he doth deserve. . .
as much as may be yielded to a man.
But Nature never framed a woman's heart
of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
misprising what they look on,
and her wit values itself so highly. . .
that to her all matter else
seems weak.
- She cannot love.
- Sure, l think so.
Yet tell her of it, hear what she will say.
No.
Rather l will go to Benedick and counsel
him to fight against his passion.
Do not do your cousin such a wrong.
She cannot be so much
without true judgement,
having so swift and excellent a wit
as she is prized to have,
as to refuse so rare a gentleman
as Signior Benedick.
He is the only man of ltaly,
always excepted my dear Claudio.
When are you married, madam ?
Why, every day. . .
tomorrow !
She's limed, l warrant you.
We have caught her, madam.
If it prove so,
then loving goes by haps.
Some Cupid kills with arrows,
some with traps.
What fire is in mine ears ?
Can this be true ?
Stand l condemned
for pride and scorn so much ?
Contempt, farewell;
and maiden pride, adieu.
No glory lives
behind the back of such.
And, Benedick,
Iove on.
I will requite thee,
taming my wild heart
to thy loving hand.
If thou dost love,
my kindness shall incite thee. . .
to bind our loves up
in a holy band.
For others say thou dost deserve,
and l believe it. . .
better than reportingly.
Are you good men and true ?
Fight, fight, yea !
Being chosen for the prince's Watch.
This is your charge:
You are to bid any man stand,
in the prince's name.
How if he will not stand ?
Then, take no note of him
but let him go.
If he will not stand when he is bidden,
he is none of the prince's subjects.
True ! And they are to meddle
with none but the prince's subjects.
You shall also make no noise
in the streets.
We will rather sleep than talk.
You speak like an ancient. . .
and a most quiet watchman,
for l cannot see
how sleeping should offend.
If you meet a thief. . .
you may suspect him,
by virtue of your office,
to be no true man;
and for such kind of men,
the less you meddle or make with them, why the more is. . .
for your honesty.
You have been always called
a merciful man, partner.
Truly, l would not
hang a dog by my will,
much more a man
who hath any honesty in him.
'Tis very true.
Well, masters,
good night.
And if there be any matter
of weight chances,
call up me.
Come, neighbour.
We hear our charge. Let us go sit here
upon the bench till two,
and then all to bed.
One word more, honest neighbours.
I pray you, watch about
Signior Leonato's door,
for the wedding being there tomorrow,
there is a great coil tonight.
Adieu.
Be vigitant, l beseech you.
It is so:
the Count Claudio shall marry
the daughter of Leonato.
Yea, my lord,
but l can cross it.
Any bar, any cross,
any impediment. . .
will be medicinable to me.
I am sick in displeasure to him,
and whatsoever comes athwart
his affection ranges evenly with mine.
How canst thou cross this marriage ?
Not honestly, my lord,
but so covertly that no dishonesty
shall appear in me.
- Show me briefly how !
- I think l told your lordship a year since. . .
how much l am in the favour of Margaret,
the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
- I remember.
- I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night. . .
appoint her to look out
at her lady's chamber window.
What life is in that
to be the death of this marriage ?
The poison of that
lies in you to temper.
Gallants. . .
I am not as l have been.
so say l.
Me thinks you are sadder.
l hope he be in love.
Old Signior, walk aside with me. l have
studied 8 or 9 wise words to speak to you . . .
which these hobby-horses
must not hear.
For my life,
to break with him about Beatrice.
My lord and brother,
God save you.
Good e'en, brother.
lf your leisure served,
l would speak with you.
- ln private ?
- lf it please you.
Yet Count Claudio may hear,
for what l would speak of concerns him.
What's the matter ?
You may think l love you not;
let that appear hereafter, and aim
better at me by that l now will manifest.
Means your lordship
to be married tomorrow ?
You know he does.
l know not that
when he knows what l know.
Hero !
Hero ! Hero !
The lady is disloyal !
lf you love her now, tomorrow wed her.
But it would better fit
your honour to change your mind.
Conrade !
What, Conrade !
Conrade, l say !
Here, man, l 'm at thy elbow.
Mass, an my elbow itched, l thought
there would a scab follow.
l will owe thee an answer
for that.
- And now, forward with thy tale.
- Sit close, then.
- Some treason, masters.
- l know him.
l have tonight wooed Margaret,
the Lady Hero's gentlewoman,
by the name of Hero.
l should first tell thee
how the prince,
Claudio, and my master, planted . . .
by my master, Don John,
saw this amiable encounter.
And thought they Margaret was Hero ?
Aye, and away went Claudio
enraged . . .
We charge you in the prince's name.
Stand.
Call up the right Master Constable.
We have here recovered . . .
the most dangerous piece of lechery
that was ever known in the commonwealth.
- Masters, Masters !
- Never speak!
There, sir.
What would you with me,
honest neighbours ?
Marry, sir, our watch tonight,
excepting Your Worship's presence,
ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves
as any in Messina.
A good old man, sir.
He will be talking.
As they say, when the age is in,
the wit is out.
Well said, i' faith,
neighbour Verges.
Well, God 's a good man.
And two men ride a horse,
one must ride behind.
All men are not alike,
alas, good neighbour.
lndeed, neighbour,
he comes too short of you.
Well, gifts that God gives !
Neighbours, you are tedious.
It pleases Your Worship
to say so,
but we are the poor duke's officers.
But truly, for mine own part,
if l were as tedious as a king,
l could find in my heart
to bestow it all on Your Worship.
All thy tediousness on me ?
l would fain know
what you have to say !
Our watch, sir, have indeed
comprehended two auspicious persons,
and we would this morning have them
examined before Your Worship.
Take their examination yourself,
and bring it me.
l am now in great haste,
as it may appear unto you.
Drink some wine ere you go.
We are now to examination
these men.
Meet me at the jail.
You come hither, my lord,
to marry this lady.
No
To be married to her,
you come to marry her.
Lady, you come hither
to be married to this count.
l do.
lf either of you have
any inward impediment . . .
why you should not be conjoined,
l charge you, on your souls, to utter it.
- Know you any, Hero ?
- None, my lord.
- Know you any, Count ?
- l dare make his answer, none.
Stand thee by, Friar.
Father, by your leave; will you
with free and unconstrained soul . . .
give me this maid,
your daughter ?
As freely, son,
as God did give her me.
And what have l to give you back,
whose worth may counterpoise . . .
this rich and precious gift ?
Nothing, unless you
render her again.
Sweet prince, you learn me
noble thankfulness.
There, Leonato,
take her back again.
Give not this rotten orange
to your friend;
she's but the sign
and semblance of her honour.
Behold how like a maid
she blushes here !
Would you not swear,
all you that see her,
that she were a maid,
by these exterior shows ?
But she is none;
she knows the heat
of a luxurious bed.
- What do you mean, my lord ?
- Not to be married,
not to knit my soul
to an approved wanton.
No
Dear my lord,
if you, in your own proof,
have vanquished
the resistance of her youth,
and made defeat
of her virginity-
No, Leonato,
l never tempted her
with word too large,
But as a brother to his sister,
showed bashful sincerity
and comely love.
And seemed l ever otherwise to you ?
You seemed to me
as Dian in her orb.
But you are more intemperate
in your blood than Venus . . .
Go away !
Or those pampered animals
that rage in savage sensuality.
ls my lord well,
that he doth speak so wide?
- Sweet prince, why speak not you ?
- What shall l speak ?
l stand dishonoured that have gone about
to link my dear friend to a common stale.
No ! No !
What man was he talked
with you yesternight . . .
out at your window
betwixt twelve and one ?
l talked with no man
at that hour, my lord.
Why, then you are no maiden.
Leonato, l 'm sorry you must hear.
Upon mine honour, myself, my brother
and this grieved count . . .
did see her, hear her,
at that hour last night . . .
talk with a ruffian
at her chamber window;
who hath indeed ,
most like a liberal villain,
confessed the vile encounters they have
had a thousand times in secret.
Oh, my cousin !
Come. Let us go.
These things, come thus to light,
smother her spirits up.
Cousin, cousin whyfor sink you down ?
Hath no man's dagger here
a point for me ?
Do not live, Hero,
do not ope thine eyes,
Grieved l, l had but one ?
Why had l one ?
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?
She, O, she is fallen into a pit of ink.
Sir, sir, be patient.
For my part, l am so attired
in wonder l know not what to say.
O, on my soul, my cousin is belied !
Lady, were you
her bedfellow last night ?
No, truly not;
although until last night . . .
l have this twelvemonth
been her bedfellow.
Confirmed, confirmed.
Would the two princes lie
and Claudio lie ?
Hence from her, let her die.
Hear me a little;
Lady, what man is he
you are accused of ?
They know that do accuse me.
l know none.
There is some strange misprision
in the princes.
Two of them have
the very bent of honour;
And if their wisdoms be misled in this, the practice
of it lives in John the Bastard.
lf they wrong her honour,
the proudest of them
shall well hear of it.
Pause awhile, and let my counsel
sway you in this case.
Your daughter here
the princes left for dead,
let her a while
be secretly kept in,
and publish it
that she is dead indeed.
What shall become of this ?
She dying, as it must be
so maintained,
upon the instant
that she was accused,
shall be lamented, pitied,
and excused of every hearer.
So will it fare with Claudio.
When he shall hear
she died upon his words,
the idea of her life
shall sweetly creep . . .
into his study of imagination,
and every lovely
organ of her life . . .
shall come apparelled
in more precious habit,
than when she lived indeed.
Then shall he mourn, and wish
he had not so accused her.
Signior Leonato,
let the friar advise you.
Being that l flow in grief,
the smallest twine may lead me.
'Tis well consented.
Presently away;
Come, lady,
die to live.
This wedding day
perhaps is but prolonged.
Have patience, and endure.
Lady Beatrice, have you wept
all this while ?
Yea.
- And l will weep a while longer.
- l will not desire that.
You have no reason,
l do it freely.
Surely l do believe
your fair cousin is wronged.
How much might the man
deserve of me that would right her !
ls there any way
to show such friendship ?
A very even way,
but no such friend.
- May a man do it ?
- lt is a man's office, but not yours.
l do love nothing in the world
so well as you.
ls not that strange ?
As strange as the thing l know not.
lt were as possible for me to say
l love nothing so well as you,
but believe me not,
and yet l lie not.
l confess nothing,
nor l deny nothing.
- l am sorry for my cousin.
- By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
Do not swear and eat it.
l will swear by it that you love me, and I will make
him eat it that says l love not you.
Why, then, God forgive me.
What offence, sweet Beatrice ?
You have stayed me in a happy hour.
l was about to protest l loved you.
And do it with all thy heart.
l love you with so much of my heart
that none is left to protest.
Come, bid me do anything for thee.
Kill Claudio.
Ah ! Not for the wide world.
You kill me to deny it.
- Fare ye well.
- Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
l am gone though l am here.
There is no love in you.
- Nay, l pray you, let me go.
- Beatrice.
- ln faith, l will go.
- We'll be friends first.
You dare easier be friends with me
than fight with mine enemy.
ls Claudio thine enemy ?
ls a' not approved
in the height a villain,
that hath slandered, scorned,
dishonoured my kinswoman ?
O that l were a man !
What, I'll bear her in hand
until they come to take hands,
and then with public accusation,
uncovered slander,
unmitigated rancour -
O God, that l were a man !
l would eat his heart
in the market place !
Hear me, Beatrice.
Talk with a man out at a window !
- A proper saying !
- Nay, but Beatrice -
Sweet Hero,
she is wronged,
she is slandered,
she is undone.
Beatrice !
He is now as valiant as Hercules . . .
that only tells a lie
and swears it.
l cannot be a man
with wishing,
therefore, l will die a woman
with grieving.
By this hand, l love thee.
Use it for my love some other way
than swearing by it.
Think you in your soul
the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero ?
Yea, as sure as l have a thought . . .
or a soul.
Enough, l am engaged,
l will challenge him.
Go.
Comfort your cousin.
l must say she is dead.
And so, farewell.
ls our whole dissembly appeared ?
Which be the malefactors ?
Marry, that am l
and my partner.
But which are the offenders
that are to be examined ?
- What is your name, friend ?
- Borachio.
Write down Borachio.
- Yours, sirrah ?
- l am a gentleman, sir,
and my name is Conrade.
Write down Master Gentleman Conrade.
Masters, it is proved already
that you are . . .
little better than false knaves.
How answer you for yourselves ?
Marry, sir,
we say we are none.
- You ?
- Sir, l say to you we are none.
Have you writ down
that they are none ?
Master Constable, you know not
the way to examine.
You must call forth the watch
that are their accusers.
Let the Watch come forth.
Masters,
l charge you in the prince's name
accuse these men.
This man said, sir,
that Don John, the prince's brother,
was a villain.
- Write down Prince John a villain.
- Master Constable.
Pray thee, fellow, peace.
l do not like thy look,
l promise thee.
What heard you him say else ?
Marry, that he had received
a thousand ducats of Don John . . .
for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
- Flat burglary, as ever was committed.
- Yeah, by mass, that it is. Hmm ?
- What else ?
- And that Count Claudio did mean . . .
upon his words to disgrace Hero before
the whole assembly, and not marry her.
Thou wilt be condemned into
everlasting redemption for this.
- What else ?
- This is all.
Prince John is this morning
secretly stolen away.
Hero was in this manner accused,
in this very manner refused,
and upon the grief of this
suddenly died.
Master Constable,
let these men be bound
and brought to Leonato's.
Come, let them be opinioned.
Let them be,
in the hands.
Off, coxcomb !
God 's my life,
where's the sexton ?
Let him write down
the prince's officer coxcomb.
Come, bind them.
Thou naughty varlet !
Away, you are an ass,
you are an ass.
Dost thou not suspect my place ?
Does thou not suspect my years ?
Oh, that he were here
to write me down an ass !
But, masters,
remember l am an ass;
though it be not written down,
yet forget not that l am an ass.
lf you go on thus,
you will kill yourself.
Bring me a father
that so loved his child,
whose joy of her is overwhelmed
like mine,
and bid him speak of patience.
But there is no such man,
for, brother, men can counsel
and speak comfort . . .
to that grief
which they themselves not feel,
but tasting it,
their counsel turns to passion.
- But--
- l pray thee, peace.
l will be flesh and blood;
for there was never yet philosopher . . .
that could endure
the toothache patiently.
Yet bend not all the harm
upon yourself.
Make those that do offend you
suffer, too.
There thou speak'st reason,
nay, l will do so.
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied,
and that shall Claudio know,
so shall the prince,
and all of them
that thus dishonour her.
Here comes the prince
and Claudio hastily.
- Good e'en, good e'en.
- Good day to both of you.
- Hear you, my lords ?
- We have some haste.
Some haste, my lord !
Well, fare you well, my lord.
Are you so hasty now ?
Well, all is one.
Nay, do not quarrel with us,
good old man.
lf he could right himself with
quarreling, some of us would lie low.
- Who wrongs him ?
- Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou.
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword,
l fear thee not.
Marry, beshrew my hand if it should give
your age such cause of fear.
ln faith, my hand
meant nothing to my sword.
Tush, tush, man,
never fleer and jest at me.
l speak not like
a dotard nor a fool,
l say thou hast belied
mine innocent child.
- You say not right, old man.
- My lord, my lord,
l 'll prove it on his body,
if he dare.
Away, l will not
have to do with you.
Canst thou so daff me ?
Thou hast killed my child.
lf thou kill 'st me, boy,
thou shalt kill a man.
He shall kill two of us,
and men indeed.
But that's no matter,
let him kill one first.
l 'll whip you from your foining fence.
Nay, as l am a gentleman, l will.
- Brother.
- Content yourself.
God knows, l loved my niece,
and she is dead,
slandered to death by villains...
scambling, outfacing,
fashion-monging boys,
that lie, and cog, and flout,
deprave and slander.
- Brother Antony
- Come, 'tis no matter,
do not you meddle,
let me deal in this.
Gentlemen both, we will not
wake your patience.
My heart is sorry for your
daughter's death, but on my honour . . .
she was charged with nothing but what
was true and very full of proof.
- My lord, my lord.
- l will not hear you.
No ? Come brother, away.
l will be heard.
And shall, or some of us
will smart for it.
See, see, here comes the man
we went to seek.
- Now signior, what news ?
- Good day, my lord.
Welcome, signior. You are almost come
to part almost a fray.
We had liked to have had our two noses
snapped off with two old men without teeth.
Shall l speak a word
in your ear ?
You are a villain.
l jest not.
l will make it good how you dare,
with what you dare, and when you dare.
Do me right, or l will
protest your cowardice.
You have killed a sweet lady,
and her death shall fall heavy on you.
Fare you well, boy,
you know my mind.
My lord,
for your many courtesies
l thank you.
l must discontinue your company.
Your brother the bastard
is fled from Messina.
You have among you killed
a sweet and innocent lady.
For my Lord Lackbeard there,
he and l shall meet,
and till then,
peace be with him.
- He is in earnest.
- ln most profound earnest.
- And hath challenged thee.
- Most sincerely.
Officers, what offence
have these men done ?
Marry, sir, they have
committed false report;
moreover, they have spoken untruths;
secondarily, they are slanderers;
sixth and lastly,
they have belied a lady;
thirdly, they have
verified unjust things,
and, to conclude,
they are lying knaves.
Who have you offended, masters, that
you are thus bound to your answer ?
This learned constable
is too cunning to be understood.
l have deceived
even your very eyes.
What your wisdoms
could not discover,
these shallow fools
have brought to light,
who in the night
overheard me. . .
confessing to this man
how Don John your brother . . .
incensed me to slander
the Lady Hero,
how you saw me court Margaret.
How you disgraced Hero. . .
when you should marry her.
The lady is dead . . .
upon mine and my master's
false accusation.
Sweet Hero.
Come, bring away
the plaintiffs.
By this time our sexton hath reformed
Signior Leonato of the matter.
And masters,
do not forget to specify,
when time and place shall serve,
that l am an ass.
Here, here . . .
comes Master Signior Leonato,
and the sexton, too.
Which is the villain ?
Let me see his eyes.
lf you would know your wronger,
look on me.
Art thou the slave that with thy tongue
hast killed mine innocent child ?
Yea, even l alone.
No, not so, villain,
thou beliest thyself.
Here stand a pair
of honourable men.
A third is fled
that had a hand in it.
l thank you, princes,
for my daughter's death.
Record it with your
high and worthy deeds.
'Twas bravely done,
if you bethink you of it.
l know not how
to pray your patience,
yet l must speak.
Choose your revenge yourself,
impose me to what penance
your invention can lay upon my sin.
Yet sinned l not
but in mistaking.
By my soul, nor l.
l cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
that were impossible:
but l pray you both. . .
possess the people in Messina here
how innocent she died,
and if your love can labour aught
in sad invention,
hang her an epitaph
upon her tomb . . .
and sing it to her bones,
sing it tonight.
Tomorrow morning
come you to my house,
and since you could not be
my son-in-law,
be yet my nephew.
My brother hath a daughter,
almost the copy of my child
that's dead,
and she alone is
heir to both of us.
Give her the right you should have
giv'n her cousin,
and so dies my revenge.
O noble sir !
Your overkindness
doth wring tears from me.
l do embrace your offer;
and dispose for henceforth
of poor Claudio.
Tomorrow then
l will expect your coming.
Tonight l take my leave.
This naughty man shall face-to-face
be brought to Margaret,
who l believe was packed in
all this wrong.
No, by my soul,
she was not,
nor knew not what she did
when she spoke to me,
but always hath been just and virtuous
in anything that l do know by her.
Moreover, sir, which indeed
is not under white and black,
this plaintiff here,
the offender, did call me ass.
l beseech you, let it be
remembered in his punishment.
l thank thee for thy care
and honest pains.
Your Worship speaks like
a most thankful and reverend youth,
and l praise God
for you.
There's for thy pains.
God save the foundation.
Go.
l discharge thee of thy prisoner,
and l thank thee.
l leave with Your Worship an arrant
knave, which l beseech Your Worship . . .
to correct yourself,
for the example of others.
God restore you to health.
l humbly give you leave
to depart,
and if a merry meeting may
be wished, God prohibit it.
Come, neighbour.
Until tomorrow morning,
lords, farewell.
Farewell, my lords.
We look for you tomorrow.
We will not fail.
Tonight l 'll mourn with Hero.
''Done to death
by slanderous tongues . . .
was the Hero
that here lies.
Death in guerdon
of her wrongs . . .
gives her fame
which never dies.
So the life. . .
that died with shame . . .
lives in death . . .
with glorious fame.''
Pardon,
Goddess of the night,
those that slew thy virgin knight,
for the which with songs of woe . . .
round about her tomb . . .
they go.
Midnight,
assist our moan,
help us . . .
to sigh and groan,
heavily, heavily.
The god of love,
That sits abo--
above,
and knows me
How pitiful l deserve--
l mean in singing;
but in loving,
Leander the good swimmer, Troilus
the first employer of panders,
and a whole book full of
these quondam carpet-mongers,
whose names yet run smoothly
in the even road of a blank verse,
why, they were never so truly
turned over and over . . .
as my poor self in love.
Marry, l cannot show it in rhyme.
l have tried.
l can find out no rhyme
to "lady" but . . .
''baby,'' an innocent rhyme;
for ''scorn,''
''horn,'' a hard rhyme;
For ''school,''
''fool ,'' a babbling rhyme.
Very ominous endings.
No, l was not born
under a rhyming planet,
nor l cannot woo
in festival terms.
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come
when l called thee ?
Yea, signior,
and depart when you bid me.
O, stay but till then.
''Then'' is spoken.
Fare you well now.
And yet ere l go,
let me go with that l came for,
which is with knowing what hath passed
between you and Claudio.
Only foul words,
and thereupon l will kiss thee.
Foul words is but foul wind,
and foul wind is but foul breath,
and foul breath is noisome,
therefore l will depart unkissed.
Thou hast frighted the word out of
his right sense, so forcible is thy wit.
But l must tell thee plainly,
Claudio undergoes my challenge,
and either l must shortly
hear from him . . .
or l will subscribe him a coward.
And l pray thee now
tell me,
for which of my bad parts . . .
didst thou first
fall in love with me ?
For them all together,
which maintain so politic
a state of evil . . .
that they will not admit
any good part to intermingle with them.
But for which of my good parts
did you first suffer love for me ?
Suffer love ! A good epithet. l do suffer
love indeed for l love thee against my will.
ln spite of your heart, l think.
Alas, poor heart.
lf you spite it for my sake,
l will spite it for yours,
for l will never love
that which my friend hates.
Thou and l are too wise
to woo peaceably.
And now tell me,
how doth your cousin ?
Very ill.
And how do you ?
Very ill too.
Serve God,
love me,
and mend.
- Madam,
- Here comes one in haste.
you must come to your uncle.
Yonder's old coil at home.
lt is proved my Lady Hero
hath been falsely accused,
the prince and Claudio
mightily abused,
and Don John
is the author of all,
who is fled and gone.
Will you come presently ?
- Will you go hear this news, signior ?
- l will live in thy heart,
die in thy lap,
and be buried in thy eyes.
And moreover, l will go
with thee to thy uncle's.
- Did l not tell you she was innocent ?
- So are the prince and Claudio . . .
who accused her upon the error
that you heard debated.
But Margaret was in some fault
for this.
Well, l am glad that
all things sort so well.
Now, daughter,
and you gentlewomen all, withdraw,
and when l send for you,
come hither masked.
The prince and Claudio promised
by this hour to visit me.
You know your office, brother,
you must be father to your brother's daughter,
and give her to young Claudio.
Which l will do with
confirmed countenance.
Friar, l must entreat
your pains, l think.
- To do what, signior ?
- To bind me or undo me, one of them.
Signior Leonato,
truth it is, good signior.
Your niece regards me
with an eye of favour.
The sight whereof l think you had
from me, from Claudio and the prince.
- But what's your will ?
- Your answer, sir,  is enigmatical.
But for my will,
my will is your goodwill . . .
may stand with ours,
this day to be . . .
conjoined in the . . .
state of honourable marriage,
in which, good Friar,
l shall desire your help.
- My heart is with your liking.
- And my help.
Here comes the prince
and Claudio.
Good morrow
to this fair assembly.
Good morrow, Prince.
Good morrow, Claudio.
We here attend you.
Are you yet determined today to marry
with my brother's daughter ?
Call her forth, brother,
here's the friar ready.
Which is the lady
l must seize upon ?
This same is she,
and l do give you her.
Sweet, let me see your face.
No, that you shall not
till you take her hand . . .
before this friar
and swear to marry her.
Give me your hand
before this holy friar.
l am your husband . . .
if you like of me.
Hero that is dead.
She died, my lord,
but whiles her slander lived.
And when l lived,
l was your other wife;
and when you loved,
you were my other husband.
One Hero died defiled,
but l do live,
and surely as l live,
l am a maid.
All this amazement
can l qualify;
when after that
the holy rites are ended,
l 'll tell you largely
of fair Hero's death.
Soft and fair, Friar.
Which is Beatrice ?
l answer to that name,
- what is your will ?
- Do not you love me ?
Why no,
no more than reason.
Why then, your uncle and the prince and Claudio
have been deceived. They swore you did.
- Do not you love me ?
- Troth, no, no more than reason.
Why then, my cousin,
Margaret, and Ursula . . .
are much deceived,
for they did swear you did.
They swore that you were
almost sick for me.
They swore that you were
well-nigh dead for me.
'Tis no such matter.
Then . . .
you do not love me ?
No, truly, but in
friendly recompense.
Come, cousin, l am sure
you love the gentleman.
l 'll be sworn upon't
that he loves her,
for here's a paper
written in his hand,
a halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
fashioned to Beatrice.
And here's another,
No.
writ in my cousin's hand,
stol'n from her pocket,
containing her affection
unto Benedick.
A miracle !
Here's our own hands
against our hearts.
Come. l will have thee,
but by this light,
l take thee for pity.
l would not deny you,
but by this good day,
l yield upon
great persuasion,
and partly to save your life, for l was
told you were in a consumption.
Peace,
l will stop your mouth.
How dost thou, Benedick
the married man ?
l 'll tell thee what,
Prince:
a college of wit-crackers
cannot flout me out of my humor.
Dost thou think l care
for a satire or an epigram ?
No, since l do purpose to marry,
l will think nothing to any purpose
that the world can say against it,
and therefore never flout at me
for what l have said against it.
For man . . .
is a giddy thing,
and this is my conclusion.
For thy part, Claudio,
l did think to have beaten thee,
but in that thou art
like to be my kinsman,
live unbruised,
and love my cousin.
Come, come,
we are friends,
let's have a dance
ere we are married,
that we may lighten our own hearts
and our wives' heels.
We'll have dancing afterward.
First, of my word.
Therefore play, music.
Prince, thou art sad,
get thee a wife !
Get thee a wife !
My lord, your brother, John,
is ta'en in flight,
and brought with armed men
back to Messina.
Think not on him
till tomorrow,
l 'll devise thee
brave punishments for him.
Strike up, pipers.
Sigh no more
Ladies, sigh no more
Men were deceivers ever
One foot in sea
and one on shore
To one thing
constant never
Then sigh not so
But let them go
And be you
blithe and bonny
Converting all
Your sounds of woe
lnto hey, nonny-nonny
Sing no more ditties
Sing no more
Of dumps so dull and heavy
The fraud of men
was ever so
Since summer first was leafy
Then sigh not so
But let them go
And be you blithe and bonny
Converting all
Your sounds of woe
lnto hey, nonny-nonny
