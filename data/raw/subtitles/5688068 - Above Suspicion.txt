You know
what's the worst thing
about being dead?
I've got something!
You get
too much time to think.
Thinkin' is painful.
Knowin' things is painful.
See these trees?
They know what's goin' happen.
They know someone's goin' die.
I was a regular girl once.
I lived in a regular town.
I dreamed of gettin' away
like all the other girls.
But things go wrong,
as things will.
Mines close.
Companies go under.
Marriages fall apart.
Jobs disappear and
paychecks stop.
But the kids are still there,
and the bills keep comin'.
And you do what you gotta do.
Or that's what
you tell yourself.
You do what you gotta do.
But it changes you, little
by little, step by step.
Soon enough, you're runnin'
with the devil himself.
Soon enough, you're
cashin' his checks.
By God!
Jackie O!
Hey, Bumpy!
Y'all comin' over tonight?
Hell yeah!
Check day, ain't it?
Exactly it is!
- All right!
- Okay.
No, he's
comin' back later.
What you doin' here, sis?
Come in for your annual perm?
Welcome
to Pikeville, Kentucky,
the town that never lets go.
Ah, what in the hell!
Hi, Ma.
You're still in your PJs at
two o'clock in the afternoon?
D'you eat?
- No.
- No?
Why?
Why?
'Cause daddy's still
asleep, that's why.
God damn it, Cash!
This is why I divorced
your hairy ass!
It is the middle
of the afternoon
and the kids ain't eat!
And they're playin'
video games again.
That is too damn violent for
kids, and even you know that.
It is cartoon or nothin'!
There you go, darlin'.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Okay, good girl.
Ah, bullshit.
You divorced me to get $86
more a month from the Welfare.
You wouldn't have
to yell at me, Susie.
The second you
stirred beside me,
I'd be ready to rise and shine.
That's your boyfriend
hittin' on me, you dumb slut!
Pay me my rent money, bitch!
And I ain't you goddam Susie.
You think I trust you alone
in a room with my Percocets?
They yours now, huh?
Why I gotta give
you half my checks?
Don't start, Susie.
Do you help with the kids?
You don't even
make 'em breakfast,
and don't call me Susie.
I don't wanna hear it.
I pick up the
checks, and I cash 'em.
The hell kinda contribution
are you makin'?
Gimme.
Where's the other half?
I cashed the West
Virginia check,
and I ain't cashed
the Kentucky one yet.
Why not?
'Cause they was
a cop in the bank.
So?
So.
I don't like havin'
no cop watchin' me
whilst I'm perpetratin'
fraud, okay?
You're not perpetratin'
fraud in Kentucky.
You live in Kentucky.
You're perpetratin'
fraud in West Virginia.
Well, you want the money?
You get it!
How 'bout that?
How 'bout I stay in bed, and
you drive to all hell and gone!
And I don't your friend Joe-Bea
kickin' in any
rent money neither!
Why you gotta let
every son of a bitch
turned you in the joint
comin' up into my...
I said...
I don't wanna hear it.
Okay?
Yeah.
There's only
two ways to make money
in this town since
the mine shut down.
One's the funeral business.
And the other's sellin' drugs.
Sometimes I wish I was
in the funeral business.
All my life, all I ever wanted
was to get out of Pikeville.
Why anybody'd wanna come
here from somewheres else,
I'll never know.
- Agent Putnam.
- Hey, Todd.
First
time I saw Mark Putnam,
I thought he looked like
a picture in a magazine.
Welcome
to our FBI outpost.
Mark Putnam.
This is my wife, Kathy.
Like he'd
stepped out of a dream
where nothin' ever went wrong.
Like I'd finally taken
too much somethin'
and started seein' things.
It'd be nice to start
off with a bang, huh?
Solve a big case?
Even in a backwater like this.
There's a couple of old drug
cases that Todd gave up on.
Maybe they'll let you
take one and run with it.
Yeah, there's also a
bank robber in the area.
He's robbed 11 banks
in four months,
and he's only gotten $21,000.
That's less than a third
of the national average.
I guess even the banks
around here are broke.
On the other hand, he's
only had about three times
as long a run than the
average bank robber,
so he's gotta be
doin' somethin' right.
What?
I just like that my wife
knows all the
relevant statistics.
Don't just drop your clothes
wherever you take
them off, Mark.
♪ When you comin' home ♪
♪ My baby's comin' home ♪
♪ Still have my soul ♪
♪ Comin' home ♪
♪ Comin' home ♪
Put the gun down!
Get out of the car!
Put it down right now!
Get out of the car!
Who created this
filing system?
Not me, and I'm not
fixing it, either.
I'm retiring in six months.
I heard you were a file clerk
before you got accepted
to the academy.
Is that right?
They say file clerks
don't make good agents.
They do say that, don't they?
Yeah, well, they're wrong.
Ah.
FBI Pikeville.
Why'd you
show yourself, deputy?
As opposed to
what, lettin' him
walk in the bank with a shotgun?
As opposed to waitin' inside,
as per the memo
I sent your boss.
We're trying to trap the man.
With civilians in there?
That's nuts.
I understand you didn't
get a plate number, either.
Well, there wasn't
no plate number.
Wasn't no plate.
Did you
recognise the vehicle?
No.
Well I guess that's it then.
What do you want?
I want to be there
when you interview
the owner of the truck.
Look, it's better
than than making me
call my supervisor
in Collington,
tell him I want to keep you
under 24-hour surveillance.
Are you threatenin' me?
Where y'all from, anyway?
Danville, Connecticut.
Where's that?
It's about an hour and
a half form New York City.
You know, the
centre of the world.
You got a name?
Mark Putnam.
Randy McCoy.
What, like the
Hatfields and the McCoys?
Yup.
I got that family habit
of holdin' a grudge, too.
So how long you been working
for the Sheriff's department?
Since November.
New sheriff's a
friend of my mom's.
Friend of your mom's?
That's how you got the job?
Yup.
How long you been
a government man?
About two weeks.
First Yankee I seen
ain't afraid to get dirty.
- Is that the truck?
- That's the truck!
Get in!
I don't get it.
Why would they bring
the truck back here?
Well, that good old
country badass boy
just givin' the truck back
to its rightful owner.
You okay, boy?
Hell yes!
You kiddin'?
Hold on!
There it is!
All Mark Putnam
wanted was to be a hero.
It was his childhood dream,
to be in the FBI
and catch bad guys.
You catch bad guys for a livin',
you must be a good guy, right?
FBI, stop or I'll shoot!
Anyways,
it was soon after that
that one of our dumb ass
customers got into a fight.
It was my little brother,
Bones, he fought with.
Would you leave me alone.
You know this one?
I'm tryin' to play cards.
He my baby boy!
That's my brother right there.
Gimme my fuckin' money, bitch!
My money now.
Come here you little...
Get your
hands off him!
That's my brother!
He picked the
right guy to mess with.
Hey, man, what the fuck?
You have no idea!
No, Bones!
What you doin'?
Hey!
Suck on this!
Georgie, come on!
Bones!
Honey!
Son of a bitch.
Shit.
Shit!
Honey, it's okay!
You'll be okay!
Bones, sweetheart!
Bones!
Bones.
Honey, Bones, no!
I'll get him to the ER.
Yeah, what's up?
Local drug
dealer's in trouble.
Like to turn snitch,
get out of it.
Chief Deputy just
told me to tell you.
No he didn't.
Not in the middle of the night.
He went to bed like
everybody else, didn't he?
You think if we put
in a few more hours,
we'll catch him doing
something stupid though, right?
And
Auburn with the rebound.
Here they come they other way.
Nice and slow.
Geiger bringing it
across the sideline,
into the front court.
Oh, shit.
Stay here!
Where else would I go?
It's your
moron of a brother.
Bones!
Jeez, am I glad to see you.
We told the cops it was
self-defense, honey, okay?
You don't have nothin'
to worry about.
Yeah.
That's true.
They didn't believe that shit.
Now, come on in, honey.
What can we get you?
He wants drugs.
He ain't got no money,
but he wants drugs.
Good to
see you too, man!
Is he dead?
He's gonna
be fine, honey.
- He's in the hospital.
- God.
I don't care what
your sister says, boy.
This is $180 for this.
And that's $610 all together.
And the only reason
I'm givin' it to you,
is 'cause you're takin' off.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
One of those is for you.
FBI, open up!
You've come back to give
yourself up, understand?
Don't let no one in unless
they show you a warrant.
Give it!
Open up!
FBI!
Use a straw, you moron.
Open it!
I have reason to believe
you're harbouring a fugitive.
We ain't harbouring nothin'!
And anything you find
without a warrant
is fruit of the poison tree.
I'm sorry, sis.
Okay, we're legal.
- Over there.
- All right!
Susie, Cash, how y'all doin'?
Move.
Randy, want to start
at the bathroom?
Sure.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go sit down
there, around the coffee table.
I told you not
to let anyone in
unless they showed
you a warrant.
He showed me his
gun, all right?
I didn't mean
that as a question.
I said sit down.
Ain't you got
somethin' to say?
I didn't start this.
You can stop it though.
You want me to save
your dumb brother's ass?
It's none of my business,
but I'd be worried
about saving my own
ass right now, Cash.
Is that right?
Well, the cocaine
residue on the table alone
is enough to violate you,
send you back to
prison for two years.
That is if your wife
flushed your whole stash,
which I somehow doubt.
Been peepin' through
keyholes, have you?
Absolutely.
Got a mirror in here.
Looks like it was
used in a bakery.
And a big ol' bag of
hillbilly heroin.
Those are prescription!
You got a prescription
for a thousands Percocet?
He's got somethin' worth
a lot more than that.
He knows somethin' that
will get him a deal
and Bones one too.
I don't want to be a party
to nobody gettin' ratted out!
Be quiet, now, honey.
What's that, Cash?
I said I ain't sayin' nothin'
until I get a deal in writin'.
Oh, you've done
this before, huh?
He's dones this
lots of times before.
What do you say
we leave Cash here
to think over his
limited options
and take the brother
for drugs for now.
I say we can do
whatever we want.
All right.
Bones shot that
boy in self-defense!
That's a fact!
Randy, man, listen for a second.
Get off me!
I'd say you're
on stronger ground
that trying to talk your
husband into making a deal.
Oh, is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
You hear that, Dick Four?
I know where we're gettin'
outta this is if we make a deal.
I gotta small wife, too, Cash.
I find it best to
shut up and listen.
Night-night.
Okay, let me get this straight.
You want a weekly salary.
You want to be off probation,
want to negotiate the
size of your bonus
for this information before
you tell us what it is,
and if you testify, you want
to be in witness protection?
That's it?
Mm-Hm.
You do realise that's
a lot to ask, right?
And even if you're John
Gotti, that's a lot to ask.
Well, I got to a lot to offer.
Who's John Gotti?
All right.
Entertain our guests
while I speak to my boss?
Yeah.
I'll tell 'em my fishin' story.
So me an my cousin Fred, we
was out noodlin' one day...
Eh, you got a phone I can use?
Big guy, 'cause
he's from my mom's side.
In private.
Grabs it by lower lip,
pulls it outta the hole,
wraps his legs
around the tail...
62-pound flathead.
He reached in with his hand?
Yeah.
They was noodlin',
you moron...
Creekview.
Who asked you?
Susan Smith?
Yeah?
Y'all got a call.
Yeah?
It's me, your sister.
- Somethin' wrong with the kids?
- No, no.
Just someone from the Welfare
in West Virginia called.
Shit.
She was checkin' up on you.
You're sure
she's from Welfare?
Yeah, she knew your
case numbers and everything.
All right, anything else?
No, I just...
thought you'd wanna know.
Yeah, all right.
Thanks.
See ya later.
Meet me in the parking lot
of the drive-thru at 7:00 a.m.
7:00 a.m.?
Why would I do that?
To get your brother
a better deal.
Keep your husband out of prison.
Maybe get a little
somethin' for yourself, too.
I don't want to talk
to Cash anymore.
I wanna talk to the boss.
When he asks you what
the call was about,
say, "None of your
business, you don't own me."
That way I'll know
you're comin'.
You sicked the Welfare on me.
There another option?
Maybe ask for
something reasonable.
His goddam boss said no.
I did say you were
asking for too much, Cash.
Well, if you want
to catch big fish,
you gotta cut good bait.
Did you really
tell them a fishing story?
Yeah, I did.
I didn't think it would
affect his mind, though.
That's not funny, man.
I got a lot to think about here.
Who was bothering you
back there, anyway?
None of your business.
You don't own me.
We done here?
I could do with
a cup of coffee.
Waitress!
God damn her.
There.
This is for coming
to meet me today.
Nice ride.
Yeah?
I inherited it from the
guy I replaced here.
He just left for his new
assignment in Los Angeles.
Lucky him.
You're not a big
fan of Pikeville?
I grew up in a town
about this size.
Alls I know is every
time I fall down,
I end up Rollin'
right back here.
I figure that makes this
the bottom of the world.
Well, your husband's
negotiated himself out of a deal
that could get you
both outta here.
Is he always this hard-headed
about getting what he wants?
He won my heart, didn't he?
And you keep callin'
him my husband.
He's my ex.
Yeah, but you live together.
We live under the same roof.
But we're not together.
I can see he's not
smart enough for you.
He's a dick four.
What is a dick four, anyway?
Well now.
I just gotta keep that in
my little book of memories,
mister hot shot FBI.
I guess a shoulda seen
that one coming, huh?
So what to you want
most outta life, Susan?
Seriously, what would
turn your life around
right now if it happened?
You must think about it.
I certainly do.
Rehab.
And money.
Rehab and money.
So you're a drug addict
who wants to get help,
but you live with your
ex who's a coke dealer.
I imagine that must be hard.
I didn't say any of that.
You did.
Why don't I tell you
what I really want.
I know what you want.
And I know what's a federal
crime and what ain't.
That's the
way the devil comes.
He don't come to you as evil.
He don't come to you on fire.
He comes as everything
you ever wanted.
He comes to you as you.
That's my pappy right there.
Hiram Grembly.
And on the other side is
Cash's daddy, Amos G. Smith.
Son of a bitch.
So I remember you
saying when you fall down
you always end up back here.
Where did you fall down?
You remember
everything I say, do you?
Yeah, of course.
Pittsburgh.
Me and Cash, we lived in
Pittsburgh for a year.
Why don't you tell me about
some of Cash's customers?
You know, what they do for a
living, that kind of stuff.
You mean what other
crimes do they commit
that you can get
'em jammed up for?
Exactly.
Mark, I'd be takin'
a hell of a big risk.
These people don't fuck around.
They find out you're a snitch,
they burn down your house,
and that is just a warnin'.
You keep doin' it, they
will cut out your tongue
and feed it to their dogs.
That's why they'd be willing
to put you through rehab,
send you and your kids
to a new state somewhere,
give you a new
identity, a decent job.
They do that?
Yeah.
They do it all the time.
Look, if you help me bring
down this bank robber,
I bet they pay you 10 grand.
Yeah, 10 grand.
I'm not judging you, Susan.
I'm just saying, you've
never tried to make
a clean break of it,
so don't give up hope.
It's hope that's
fuckin' me up.
I understand.
Here.
Take this for now.
Just remember, big
risks pay big money.
Small risks, small money.
Okay?
Pretty, ain't they?
You wanna hold one of them guns?
They feel like...
power.
You know?
Just make sure you read the
papers the next few days, okay?
Easy Street's just down yonder.
Come on!
Damn.
You ain't started goin'
to church again, have you?
Why?
You wouldn't care if
I was being ordained.
Am I right?
Come on, Susan!
You can't keep doing this to me.
If you want me to
keep paying you,
you have to give me something.
Seriously.
I've given you
hundreds of dollars,
and you haven't given
me a goddam thing.
I keep telling you.
My life would be in danger.
I know, but your life's
in danger now, isn't it?
How long you think
you can keep this up?
How long before you find
yourself in jail or dead?
Then what are your
kids gonna do?
How are they gonna live?
You think the judge
will give 'em the cash,
or you think they'll
wind up in foster care?
You got a kid, huh?
Yeah.
Wife too?
We're talkin'
about you, Susan.
Tell me what she's like.
Is she young?
Is she pretty?
Does she have a good body?
She keeps herself fit,
if that's what you mean.
Oh, she's too
high-class for me.
Is that it?
No.
'Cause high class ain't a
always so good in a woman.
If she won't suck your
dick at the movies,
then what the hell
kinda good is she?
Oh, come on.
Stop it.
Cash may treat you
like a cheap whore,
but that's no reason
to talk like one.
Susan.
You're the key to
everything I wanna do here.
Do you understand that?
To me, you're the most
important woman in this town.
For God sake, learn
to act like it.
He's name's Joe-Bea.
My ex met him in prison.
He lives with us.
He has for four months.
I didn't know how to tell you.
I'm sorry.
Outstanding.
You've actually
seen the shotguns?
Susan, this is amazing.
Oh, come on, Susan.
I can't do that.
You know that.
Yeah, okay.
He actually talked
about an upcoming robbery?
God, I hate to day
it, but I think
we gotta let him go
through with this one,
or else it won't mean
a thing in court.
Damn.
All right,
everybody, this is a stick-up!
Get away from the door!
Come on, move it!
Let's go, right now!
- Right now!
- Easy.
Now you
fill bag up with money,
- and do it quick!
- Don't shoot!
You two, get the
fuck out that room!
Right now, old man!
And freeze!
And put up your hands!
Shit!
Shit!
All right!
All yous, get there
in that there vault!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go!
I don't have to kill you now.
All right!
Now just give me the rest
of the money, old lady!
All of it!
Let's go!
I haven't got all day!
Come on!
Hurry up now!
And do it quick!
Heard you!
All right,
come on, come on, come on!
Not all the way!
Now, I'm sorry I
ruined all y'all's day.
Please.
Come on!
Oh, shit!
I'm shot!
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Guess what.
Joe-Bea just robbed the
First National Bank.
You ready for this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What next?
Well, he's probably looking
for a place to hide out.
You gotta help me
find out where.
Okay.
Okay.
I gotta go.
Yeah.
Jeremy
Sprickland is 26 years old,
5'11", 250 pounds.
- Hello.
- It's me.
Hey, boy.
I got some
money for you, but...
It's gonna be hard to pass.
It's covered in dye.
You want it anyway?
Why don't you
give me that number
up there where you're at.
Okay, here it comes.
Shoot.
I'll call you back
in a couple days.
All right then.
We'll be lookin' out.
What are you doin'?
What do you think?
Yeah!
Mama!
You don't gotta carry that.
Georgia, help the
woman, will ya?
What's wrong with ya, huh?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Give it.
Better be right about this.
Yeah, I know.
You've got three
different agencies involved
on the word of one drug addict.
It's the kinda math
that'll get ya fired.
Joe!
Get down!
FBI and the
Kentucky State Police!
You're surrounded!
Come out with your hands up
in the next 30 seconds,
or we're comin' in!
Shit.
Okay.
You take my mama.
You two hide in the closet.
I'm goin' out back.
Okay?
Give me a minute to get dressed!
Hold your fire!
I'm goin' in after him!
Go!
Go, go!
FBI!
Freeze!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Cars be advised.
We're getting reports of shots
fired, shots fired, 11463.
You cock-suckin'
sons of bitches!
In a fair fight, I'd kick
both your fuckin' asses!
You hear me?
No, no!
Let him go!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Get on the ground now!
- Stay there!
- Son of a bitch.
When I heard that shot,
I damn near wet myself.
Yeah.
Imagine how I felt.
And not
knowin' who got shot,
time you come round the corner,
my heart was beatin'
like a big bass drum.
You shoulda
seen his face.
Well, thank God the
handcuffs, right?
And when it started,
when the lights come on like...
Yeah, that was
pretty cool, huh?
I felt like we
were on the TV news.
We did it, didn't we?
Yeah, we did.
We are a hell of a team.
You deserve a reward.
Did you ever come like...
like it came up from your toes
and travelled through
your whole body?
No.
Well, get us one of them
cabins, boy, and you will.
Hey, sweetheart.
Kathy, hi.
Guess what.
We got him.
He's in custody.
Hi, sweetie.
Daddy's home.
You hungry?
Yeah, I know.
Sweetie, yeah.
God.
Did you get in a fight?
Oh, no, it's nothing.
I got in a scuffle.
Congratulations.
Putnam residence.
Who's calling?
Miss Putnam?
This is Susan Smith.
I hope you don't mind
my callin' you at home.
I'm lookin' for your
husband, but I can't say why.
I've heard all
about you, Susan.
But I'm afraid Mark
isn't here right now.
He's out trying to make
friends with the locals.
I have to say, it's easier
said than done around here.
Well, shit, Kathy, if
you got no one to talk to,
you're knockin' on
the wrong doors.
Around here, the rich folk,
they got bugs up their asses.
You what to find
yourself some losers
if you want to have any fun.
Actually, that's
true in Connecticut it.
Is it?
Listen, I don't wanna
cross any wires or nothin',
but do you want to get a
cup of coffee or somethin'?
Hey, I mean, if you
don't want to, it's okay.
No, no, I...
I think that's a great idea.
Good.
Okay, well...
Let me just think of
somewhere that's...
out of the way.
We gotta keep this
on the down-low.
Yeah, we do, don't we?
Yeah.
Mark?
God, he's the straightest
arrow I ever met.
He told me at his junior prom
his date took him out
to the football field
to join her friends, and
they were smokin' a joint,
just one joint, and he
ran all the way home.
Two miles.
He already knew he
wanted to be in the FBI.
It's the most important
thing in the world to him.
Not more than
you and the baby.
Well, no.
Well, I hope not.
What about you?
You a straight arrow, too?
Not really.
I got thrown outta Catholic
school for smokin' pot.
And then I discovered boys,
and I really went on a tear.
By the time I was 18, my
nickname was "Trouble".
When I was 18, I wanted
to be a Playboy Playmate.
I guess...
one day I realised
that all my friends
were growing up and I wasn't.
They were all getting married
and starting families and...
I was still waking up
with men I didn't know.
I decided it had to stop.
Yeah?
Well how'd you do it?
Told my parents the truth.
They sent me to
rehab in Arizona.
Paid off all my drug debts.
And then I met Mark.
And now we have
a five-year plan.
We're gonna stay
here for two years,
then get transferred to one
of the big regional offices
with a little more
room for advancement.
And then we're gonna
have another baby.
You made
that plan together?
Mm-Hm.
You you're kinda a team.
Mark told me that
you wanted to make
a new start, too, Susan.
I just want to tell you I
think that's really great.
And I would love
to help if I can.
You don't want that, huh?
No, I don't really
drink anymore, but...
I was gonna order
a Diet Coke, but...
you were too fast for me.
- You mind if I...
- No, no.
Oh, you're makin'
me crazy, boy.
I ain't fucked this
way since I was 15.
I could do this forever.
I couldn't
get enough of that man.
You coulda told me a hundred
times he was empty inside.
You coulda told me
he was just a mirage
and when I got up
close he'd be gone.
It wouldn't make no difference.
I even liked the risk.
When we made love in his
wife's bed, that was intense.
That was all I needed to know.
Well, my dad was
a truck driver.
You shoulda seen his
face when he found out
I got a scholarship to Pomfrey.
He told everybody about it.
Even told his dispatcher.
What's Pomfrey?
It was a private school
we couldn't afford.
Not even with the scholarship.
He had to raise like $1,000
a year to pay the extra.
Which was hard
for him, you know?
The first time he talked
about me to his friends,
I guess it was the first
time he was proud of me.
He loved you.
Yeah.
Then he had to go and die
when I was in college.
I just wish he coulda been
there when I got into the FBI.
He woulda gone crazy.
You don't have to be perfect
to get people to love you, Mark.
Look at me.
Hey, what's the matter?
Oh, no, I'm just a
little drug sick is all.
I wasn't cut out to be sober.
You're doin' great.
I'm proud of you.
You are the only thing
that makes me feel
any good these days.
Course I started
thinking I deserved better.
That I shoulda been
the one by his side.
Maybe I was pushin' too hard.
And then Denver
Rhodes walked in.
One of
y'all's Mark Putnam.
I am.
Why?
I'm 'bout to hand you the
biggest case of your life, boy.
Two goddam tonnes of weed.
You can close the drawer.
I ain't armed.
Now, you best to
take notes, boy.
'Cause I got a lot to say.
He told Mark
about a big smuggling operation
over in Stoville, run by a
crook named Rufus Greene.
Rufus Greene.
He was moving
trucks full of dope from Mexico
and stashin' 'em in a played
out old coal mine he bought.
Now, this man ain't
just interstate.
He's international.
Now, I understand
that there can be
some compensation
arrangements made...
Mark
started workin'
all the time on that bust.
Yes, your honour.
I'm seeking a search warrant
on the comrades coal
mine in Medford.
All buildings and all
the structures thereon,
of all persons thereon,
all vehicles thereon.
I've attached three kinds
of supporting material.
Rufus aint' fuckin' around.
If he finds out I'm meeting
with you, I'm dead, man.
I'm not gonna to talk to him.
I promise you that, Devin.
Show me a man
who's workin' all the time,
and I'll show you the
woman he's hidin' from.
This is the single biggest
case this division's ever seen.
Listen to me, I
spoke to the bureau.
I think they're willing
to go as high as 30 grand.
All right.
Do you think you can
stay in there a little longer?
The husband works in
an abandoned coal mine.
This is his headquarters.
This is an overview of
the entire compound.
It's filled with many warehouses
we believe can hold up to
5,000 pounds of marijuana.
I will
faithfully execute the office
of President of
the United States.
And will,
to the best of my abilities.
And will,
to the best of my abilities.
Preserve, protect,
and defend the Constitution.
I told you you
can't come here.
Where were you?
I waited at the
motel for an hour.
I told you sometimes
things would come up
and I wouldn't be
able to see you.
Okay?
I told you that.
Why didn't you call?
'Cause something came up.
Why didn't you answer...
'Cause something
came up, Susan.
Susan, I can't always drop
everything for you, okay?
I have a job.
Have a family.
But I need you, too.
When me and Cash...
were in Pittsburgh,
we knew a drug dealer
who had a cop in his
pocket, a captain.
Now, you gotta look
into that, don't you?
It'd be a feather in
your cap, wouldn't it?
To bust a crooked captain
on the Pittsburgh PD.
When was this?
Before I got pregnant
by Cash like a fool.
All right, listen.
We'll talk about
it sometime, okay?
When?
I'll call you.
When?
Tomorrow.
I promise.
What?
Did you have fun at
the Red Clay Motel?
No.
Bullshit.
Bumpy said he saw you
comin' outta there.
I didn't say I wasn't there.
I said I didn't have no fun.
What did Bumpy do,
anyway, run up here
and squeal so you could
get him high, right?
What are you...
Why don't you go stay
at your boyfriend's house,
whoever he is?
You c...
You can't do this.
If you come in here, I'll
break your fuckin' neck.
No.
No, Cash.
Cash, you can't!
You get
the hell outta here!
We have to let her stay, Mark.
At least for tonight.
Tomorrow, she can move
in with her sister.
We have to.
She can't go home.
I don't believe that.
You think that
she's making it up?
I wouldn't
put it past her.
She's not a liar.
How do you know?
'Cause I know that you
would never take the word
of an informant that
you knew to be a liar.
Long-fought battle
to become a serious artist.
Then she steeped
into the spotlight,
and she is quite remarkable.
Still quick to protect
her private life,
she's still a genius at
marketing her talent.
I could
tell he was pullin' away.
I just figured I could
reel him back in.
Then I found out what
was really goin' on.
Can I tell you my news now?
Sure.
Sure, what's that?
I'm pregnant.
Due in March.
Which wasn't part
of the plan, but...
it's great anyway.
Don't you think?
It's incredible.
I'd
been fornicatin'
like a long-eared rabbit,
and Kathy gets pregnant?
Shit.
Hey, Susie.
How y'all doin'?
How's Cash?
Yeah, everything's
okay, thanks, Rufus.
Well, I hope
business is good, too.
It's almost end of the month.
Now, what's got you so upset
you had to come all the way
here and tell me about it?
The FBI is about to bust
your pot smuggling deal.
And how the fuck
would you know?
Trust me, Rufus, I know.
We're up on the hill
watchin' the place,
and just before dawn two trucks
came down goin' real fast.
Couldn't get down here
near in time to catch 'em.
Yeah, I heard.
We won't all his
connections, but
there is enough
loose pot around here
to make an interstate
trafficking case
against old Rufus Greene.
Sorry, Mark.
No, it's not your fault.
The hell y'all doin' here?
This is a crime
scene, Mr. Greene.
This is my property.
You want to confess to
interstate trafficking
now, Rufus?
Or do you want to wait
til you're indicted?
Now, that'll be the day.
Now, I ain't been up
this way in years.
Now, I got plans
for this property,
but I don't hang around here.
This is a dump.
I can back him up
on that, officer.
I ain't never been up
here before, neither.
We got photos of
him here, dumb ass.
Fuck you callin' dumb?
And it's Special Agent
Putnam to you, boy.
Well, then you got pictures
of your little girlfriend
up here too, then.
That's right.
What'd you just say?
You heard me.
What'd you just say?
Go on, Rufus.
He heard me?
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mark!
- Mommy!
- What?
Somebody broke the window!
Inside the house.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Shh, it's
okay, it's okay, sweetie.
Mommy!
Mom!
Hey.
Who are you expecting
to call, anyway?
What do you mean?
I mean you're
guarding the phone
like you did when you were 13.
I don't know.
Nobody.
Why don't you get outta bed
and help me with
the groceries, then?
Sis!
I gotta go.
Ain't nothin' good
gonna come of that.
Of what?
You know what.
Messin' around with
that goddam federal cop.
I'm an important informant.
One day I might disappear
in the witness protection,
so you better enjoy
me whilst I'm here.
You're gonna get
yourself killed.
Rufus Greene sent somebody
to burn down my
house last night.
You don't blame me, do you?
Yeah, I do.
Well, I did not
tell Rufus Greene
- about your precious drug bust.
- Of course you did, Susan.
Bullshit.
Jesus Christ, stop lying.
My kid was in that house!
You put my family in danger!
I did not.
I got six grand in
this bag here for you.
You sign this receipt, I'll
give it to you right now.
I was gonna hold onto it
til after you testified.
Then I realised I needed to
get through this encounter.
This encounter's gonna
be hard for you, huh?
No, it's gonna
be hard for you.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Do you understand?
Only unless I have to.
What does that mean,
"only if you have to"?
If there's blood on
the ground, call me.
Otherwise, leave me alone.
Well, it don't
work that way, Mark.
It do not work that way!
This ain't a way to treat
your star-fuckin'-witness!
Hey, Mom,
it's a Mustang!
How do you
know what a Mustang is?
Everyone knows.
Everyone
knows, do they?
And my girl knows as well.
And what do you think, mister?
Where the hell
you steal that at?
I love it!
I bought it.
With what?
With half the
four grand I got.
I'm a give you the other half.
Where the hell
you get four grand?
I extorted that guy, that
guy from the Red Clay Motel.
All right.
Gimme the money.
Are we even?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Are we even?
Yeah.
Gimme the money.
Tell me who
gave you this money!
I told you!
He's a rich guy
from Lector County.
You don't know him!
And you don't want to!
Why'd he give you the money?
Huh?
Tell me the truth this time.
'Cause I sucked his
cock, and that's why!
Watch your side there.
Lock her down.
Got it?
Let's go.
Don't.
You have broken ribs.
Oh.
I guess there was blood
on the ground, huh?
I didn't mean for you
to go and spill some.
I tell you what.
If I'd known you to come,
I woulda kicked his
ass a whole lot sooner.
You hear me?
It's from Kathy.
Oh, God, Mark.
You are the...
only man I ever knew
who's been good to me.
Lock the door, will ya?
I'm trying to stop
betraying my wife.
And she thinks if I avoid
you, I'm betraying you.
I feel like I'm
lettin' everybody down.
Susan?
Look, you gotta stay away
from Cash until the trial.
I want you in good shape
if you're gonna
testify against...
I need you, Mark.
More than ever.
If you go, I don't
know what I'll do.
Okay?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
All you gotta do
is tell the truth.
All right?
Okay.
You ready to
meet your new partner?
My what?
Your new partner.
Bob Singer, this
is Mark Putnam.
I don't like carrying rookies.
You shouldn't have to, Bob.
Obviously you're
carrying enough as it is.
Bob worked undercover
drugs in Baltimore.
Tough duty.
Somebody tried to kill him,
so the bureau
transferred him here.
Someone who'd make
your little bank robber
look like a schoolgirl.
If somebody tries to kill you,
the bureau will transfer you?
Of course.
Think of the liability.
Snitch!
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,
and nothin' but the
truth, so help you God?
Yeah, I do.
Please be seated.
How long
have you known Mr. Reevis?
Since he got outta prison
and come stay with us.
Last year in the
spring, I guess.
The fall.
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't mean that.
I was confused.
It's been a while.
In the fall.
All right.
Could you tell us,
in your own words,
what you found in his room?
He had a green
duffel bag with two
sawed off shotguns in it
and two black ski masks.
- Liar!
- You are a liar!
Thank
you very much, Miss Smith.
Thank you for your courage.
You've begun to make it safe
for a person in Pike County
to go into the bank and
deposit their paycheck
without being...
When
a man tells you
you're doin' the right thing...
he means you're doin'
the right thing for him.
Water heater's busted again.
What, it's gonna take two of
y'all to fix the water heater?
Apparently the FBI have
rules about male agents
being left alone with
female informants.
That's funny.
Nobody told me.
Yeah, nobody told me either.
They damn well
should have.
I knew Mark didn't
have no use for me no more.
He'd already told me he
was turning his drug case
over to fat Bob.
But when I heard he
was leaving town,
and he didn't have the guts
to tell me to my face...
That I had to see for myself.
I've been fuckin'
your husband!
You know that?
I said...
I've been fuckin' your fuckin'
husband, you stupid cow!
Oh, what?
Don't that mean nothin' to you?
Don't that make
you feel nothin'?
It makes me feel bad.
For you.
That you wanted a
better life so much
that you thought you
could just take mine.
It's not gonna happen.
Shit.
I guess everybody
got what they wanted.
Mark was the golden
boy of the FBI.
This is Mark
Putnam, everybody.
He's broken more cases
in his first year
than any two of you together.
If you want to learn
how to be meticulous
and thorough, watch this guy.
Kathy
got the big house
and, of course, Mr. Perfect.
Sold!
Rufus Greene
retired to Mexico.
Denver Rhodes got 30
grand and blew it.
Fat Bob got to run the
Pikeville FBI all by himself.
Even my dumb ass brother
Bones got off for time served.
Me?
Well, guess what I got.
Traitor!
Come on, get up, Susie!
Get over here, bitch!
Come on, Georgia!
You stupid mother!
You'd sell your
fuckin' husband, bitch!
Help me.
Why think you can come around
here anymore, I don't know!
Bitch.
The day Mark
Putnam came to town
is the day my life went to shit.
You wanna do somethin'
about it, Susie?
Like what?
And don't call me Susie.
Like file an
official complaint.
The bureau'd take
your allegations
very, very seriously.
I look to you like
the kinda person
gets revenge by
filing a complaint?
Well, what do you want to do?
I'll help you do it.
Whatever it is,
I'll help you do it.
Want me to take you to the ER?
No.
I can
send you the report,
but it's gonna be
heavily redacted.
I can't tell you who they are.
I can compromise
their operation.
Illinois, 9011, yes.
Arrester Mr. Abbons
Huggins, address 141203
- Lakeshore Drive.
- Hey, Mark.
You know someone named Susan?
Who may be a tad hostile?
Yeah, I'll take her
in the conference room.
Hello?
Hello...
Mr. Perfect.
You know, you should've
been an agent, Susan.
How'd you find me?
Cut the crap, Mark!
I'm pregnant.
What are you...
Jesus Christ.
Susan...
You wanna
know what he said?
Are you sure?
He asked
me if I was sure
it was his, son of a bitch.
I'm not saying it like that.
I'm saying, are
you sure it's mine?
You find
out what a man's made of
when you catch him by surprise.
Look...
I'm coming back to court
in Pikeville in two weeks.
We'll talk then.
Okay?
What the fuck
took you so long?
What?
I saw you park!
What the fuck took you
so long to get up here?
What are you talkin' about?
Oh, I am sick of
this shit, Mark!
You fucked me over,
you piece of shit!
How'd you even
know I was here?
'Cause I'm staying here?
In the Pikeville?
Who's payin' for that?
The FBI.
Oh, you mean Bob Singer.
Yeah.
And why is Bob
Singer paying for you
to stay the Pikeville?
Oh, so I can chew your
head off, that's why.
'Cause he hates the
fact that I fucked you
and I will not fuck his fat ass!
Shh!
I told you I'd make
time this weekend.
I'm ready now.
Well I'm not, Susan.
I'm beat, and I gotta prep
this drug trafficking case
all day at the
courthouse tomorrow.
You know, I shoulda killed
her when I had the chance.
Killed who, Susan?
I didn't mean that.
Just slipped out.
I mean, Jesus, look at you.
You're so stoned, you don't
even know what you're saying.
Fuck you, Mark.
When was the
last time you ate?
Huh?
Have you eaten anything all day?
Let me drop my bags,
and I'll take you
to the drive-thru, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
I ain't got no money.
Everyone in this
town wants me dead.
Jesus.
So what happened to
witness protection?
They gave me the cash
to relocate on my own.
Okay, so
what happened to that?
What happened to it?
I'm an addict.
What do you think
happened to it?
You left me barefoot
and pregnant, Mark.
What do you want
me to do, Susan?
I want you to suffer.
I mean about the baby.
I'm a tell your
wife about the baby.
I'm gonna tell the FBI.
Fat Bob says they will
fire you on the spot!
Fat Bob again, huh?
You're everything that
he hates about the bureau.
Bunch of candy-ass hypocrites
wearin' suits and ties.
Well he don't wear
no suit and tie.
And he don't fuck his
informants neither.
Susan, to be honest, you
don't look five months pregnant.
They say drugs keep it small.
Have you thought about
getting an abortion?
Can we please just try and
have a reasonable conversation?
You were gonna save me.
I needed someone to save me,
and you were gonna be the one.
You even said so yourself.
Susan, if I could
drop everything
and start again, I would.
I'm trying to do the
right thing, I just can't.
Look, the most important
thing here's the baby.
What do you want to do about it?
Do you want me and
Kathy to raise it?
You and Kathy?
I am a good mother!
Come on, Susan.
Where are your kids now?
You take that back,
you son of a bitch.
How dare you!
Take it back!
Christ!
What the hell's the
matter with you, Susan?
You tryin' to kill us both?
Me?
You're the one
who's screwin' me.
I'll be damned if I'll watch
you prance back to Chicago
with that stuck-up
wife of yours.
How about we leave my
wife out of this, okay?
She's the only one who hasn't
brought this on herself.
You fucked up my life.
Oh, Jesus, just tell
me, Susan, please,
what is it that you want?
I want you to have
this baby with me.
I want you to be
there when he's born.
And I want you to sign the
birth certificate as his daddy.
Second, I want you to
leave that whore, Kathy,
and those stuck-up brat kids.
I swear, if you say one
more thing about my wife...
Oh, what are
you gonna do, huh?
You gonna hit me?
Well, go ahead, 'cause men
have been hittin'
me my whole life.
Jesus Christ.
Please!
Can we just try to find a
solution for our problem?
Our problem?
Your problem.
I've never been
happier in my life.
Is I.
I told all my friends that
I'm a raise me an FBI baby.
Oh my god, you're
fuckin' nuts.
Do you really think I'd ever let
a kid of mine grow up with you?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you to hell!
Well,
that wasn't exactly
a meetin' of the minds.
Least he felt bad
about the whole thing.
He couldn't eat.
He couldn't sleep.
For months, he didn't
know what to do.
Then, all of a sudden, he did.
I need to
tell you something.
Now?
Yeah.
Before I tell anyone else.
It's about me and Susan.
Don't.
It's over.
It's in the past.
It's not.
All right, shoot.
I'm so sorry, Kathy.
It's worse than you think.
Did you get her pregnant?
Yeah.
Kathy.
Don't.
I didn't mean
don't have a drink.
Good.
I meant there's more.
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!
Fuck you!
Stop!
Stop it!
You're not gonna win!
You're never gonna win!
Stop it!
It was an accident.
I swear.
If it was an accident...
why didn't you tell somebody?
We were fighting.
If it was an accident
while we were fighting,
that's manslaughter.
I'm going to Washington
today to confess.
I have to.
You have to?
It's what my father
would've wanted.
You father?
You're worried
about your father?
'Course I
remember those last few minutes
a little different than he does.
But people only remember
what they can stand to.
Don't tell anyone.
Not anyone.
It can stay between you and me.
I can live with this.
I can.
I can't.
Baby, I've tried.
I just can't.
By then, Mark
wanted to be punished.
He thought he deserved it.
The average sentence for
manslaughter is six years.
You serve two.
I'm sorry.
Mark
took 14 and served 10.
You're just doing your job.
Kathy stood by him.
Or tried to.
She died of drink about
a year 'fore he got out.
Yes, I did.
You did what, Agent Putnam?
It's important that
you be specific.
For a second it sounded
like you meant to say...
I didn't mean that.
I killed her.
I broke her neck.
He surprised the
hell outta people round here.
They figured somebody I'd
snitched on had done it.
He told 'em where
to find me, too,
or they wouldn't a had
no proof of nothin'.
I've got somethin'!
Course, he
didn't decide to confess
until 10 months
after he killed me,
so the dogs got
at me pretty good.
If I hadn't a been so mad,
I woulda just had
the baby by myself.
God damn you.
That's her.
I guess I was wrong
about all them gettin'
what they wanted, huh?
In the long run, anyways.
Course, in the
long run, who does?
Like I said, worst
thing about being dead,
you get too much time to think.
And I knew right at that
point that I had compromised
everything that
I had worked for.
Because I broke the first rule
of an FBI agent-informant
relationship.
Never sleep with
your informants.
I pride myself on my ability
to compartmentalise aspects
of my life, and I thought that
I could keep that in check.
I cared a great deal for her.
I can't lie about that.
A lot of her
problems that she had
were a result of her
cooperating with me.
She came across the
seat and jumped on me
and started punching,
and hitting,
and slapping, and pulling hair.
She kept comin' at
me, and I grabbed her.
And I said, "Cut the crap."
I didn't realise the
force that I had on her.
And next thing I knew,
she was layin' into me.
Nothing.
Then I looked up in the air,
and I said, "What do I do, dad?
"What do I do?"
