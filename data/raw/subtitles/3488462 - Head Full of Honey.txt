HONEY IN THE HEAD
Everything I know about
the illness of my grandfather,
I know from my pediatrician
Dr. Ehlers.
Mein grandpa has Alzheimer's.
People who have that,
forget much.
In fact, I forget often
what homework I have to do,
or to brush my teeth.
But with Grandpa is different.
My parents wanted
to put him in a home for the elderly.
That's why I had to take
in hand the matter.
We two got to Venice.
There grandpa would remember more.
Although it was 40 years ago,
when he made grandma
a marriage proposal.
People with Alzheimer's brush
his teeth three times
because they forget that
they have been cleaned.
But they know exactly
that they have used
flossing 25 years ago.
I forget this always.
Hi, Dad, hi, Mom,
I hope you are doing well.
Don't you worry about us.
Grandpa and I are sitting on the train,
but you'll see that. And...
We ate breakfast already.
Chips, because
they are so healthy.
- Want to say something?
- What?
- Who?
- Dad and Mom.
Hello?
Hello?
They're gone...
In any case...
I love you.
Until tomorrow or the day after.
Ciao!
Where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Oh shit! Grandpa!
Hey, it was you?
- Remain standing. Police!
- Grandpa!
Grandpa!
So, we are:
my grandpa Amandus and me.
I now understood why
grandpa is the way he is.
Why my parents are
the way they are,
I believe, I will never understand.
Why aged people change their mind?
My parents are talking constantly
what was last week
or will be in future.
My grandpa just doesn't remember.
I mean, what will happen tomorrow
or happened last week.
And I think sometimes
it's not so bad after all.
Actually all started
when grandma died.
She gave, so to speak,
a touch of glamour to our village.
She wanted to discover the world.
- They'll burn her?
- Who?
- Well, your granny.
- Are you crazy?
Then she'll be eaten by worms.
But she'll be in a coffin.
They come through.
Can we change the subject?
Okay.
As long as a man is not forgotten,
he lives in our memories.
What is at a grave stone
of a chimney sweep?
I don't know.
- "He never returns."
- Funny.
Dear Amandus,
in our last conversation
you wished to tell yourself
something about your wonderful wife.
Margarethe was...
just great.
Much more she was:
magnanimous and so...
so full of warmth.
And I'm not just talking
about her large breasts.
I know you know it all.
Is that to say
if the woman is just died?
Margarethe has always laughed
at my jokes.
But I have also eaten up
her last apple pie.
That... That... That is covered
with spray cream.
She no longer has baked for years.
And I really couldn't smell it.
But... I've done it again and again.
Because man is, after all,
a creature...
A creature of habit.
I really wanted
something else.
So perhaps plum cake.
Or, ahn, apricot tart or...
Here, ahn...
How we say here...
Ahn, marzipan cake.
Or... yes!
Cream puffs. Cream puffs I also
like very much.
The... The best marzipan torte,
by the way, is...
What's its name?
At the crossroads,
where she have after...
Afterthought.
Yes, she kissed my ass.
Grandma!
What I would now give
for a piece of your apple pie.
My Elisabeth.
- Elisabeth?
- That was his mother.
What shall I do without you now?
Niko, I... I just hope
that you also find one day
a so wonderful woman
as it was your mother for me.
Oh!
See you soon, my lovely.
After the funeral
Daddy has offered Grandpa
that he only once draws us.
But grandpa didn't want to.
He didn't want to leave grandma alone.
Daddy then sometimes
drove me to grandpa at weekends.
We went then always
to Grandma's grave
and laid flowers on it.
At home I was often alone,
because I am a latchkey.
My parents are there
and they often argue
because daddy had sex
with another woman
and mum at the Christmas party
then made the same
with her boss.
Daddy was really angry,
but grandpa said:
"What the rooster may,
that may the chickens also."
Grandpa was in fact vet.
Daddy always says
that the farmers just pretended
that a cow was sick,
because they found it nice
when grandpa comes to visit.
When daddy told that,
he was always very proud od grandpa.
One day he called us and said
he no longer found the way
to the cemetery.
Grandad!
- Grandpa!
- Hello?
- The police called.
- Why?
- Your father is with them.
- Where?
- At the police station.
- Why?
- Now hold you.
- Better not. Tell what's going on.
Better not.
- I'll tell you what's going on.
- Say it.
He made a missing person's report.
- From your mother.
- No, no?
You must meet him.
They keep him there.
- What is?
- Come, let's pick grandad up.
- Hello.
- Rosenbach.
I want to pick up my father,
Amandus Rosenbach.
Oh yes, who has reported
his dead wife as missing.
Here.
He has forgotten this with us.
- Who is this?
- My mother.
- When she was young.
- This is the mug shot.
Where is he now?
- At home
- Why that?
- You wanted to hold him.
- He wanted.
And he was never driven
with a police car.
Tilda!
My little principessa!
Look, I also know that one
from somewhere.
Come in.
Nice that you visit me.
Here, sit down.
- Do you like a cookie?
- With pleasure.
- Grandad?
- Yes?
Why are all your things to eat
in the bookcase?
In the dishwasher was no more room.
Mm.
Ahn...
Looking for something?
- The cleaning lady?
- I've fired.
- How so?
- She stole.
- What?
- The jewelry of your sister.
I have no sister.
But you always wanted one, right?
- Here. Everything is still there.
Ah.
Margarethe.
Isn't she beautiful?
All were after her.
Everyone wanted her...
but she had for me...
So...
She wanted with me.
You were with the photo
to the police.
- Why?
- That I wanted to know from you.
I probably wanted to brag.
Oh, my God.
And? How was it?
- Where?
- In the police car.
Oh, that...
That has paid off.
Here.
- It's not real.
- Yes, look at it.
Look, point...
That's loud!
Oh, yes!
Say, have you still all?
Where did you get it?
At least not from the media market.
What do you think
when you pull on us?
That should not be a problem.
If you need me.
But only if I can bring
some of my sea...
here, ahn... seagulls.
One, two, three, four, five.
Another three
and I've won again.
Amandus?
I thinking about my next train.
- We don't play chess.
- Mom, let it!
Okay, then think
about your next train.
If I go to the left,
she cuts me from behind the way.
That would not be wise.
That wouldn't be wise.
But if you go along here,
everything is free.
- What do you mean?
- Look.
Hier ist not good.
That's what you said.
Here ist the danger of an...
ambush.
And here is a long free path.
Thank you.
Oh.
A six.
A six.
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...
So.
You have a six, not ten.
- Are you crazy?
- The game has rules.
Who is in favor to play
according to the rules of grandad?
Oh.
Not a scratch!
You can, here, ahn...
invite.
- Invite?
- Great.
Here is it the "Hidden Camera"?
Niko, that was not settled.
It was about his favorite things,
but he drags his whole furniture.
- A refrigerator!
- That's his bookshelf.
this botch doesn't fit
our style of furnishing.
- We are not a junk room.
- He hangs on his clothes.
- He like that.
- How nice!
I need a circus trainer.
- Watch it, you Hobbit!
- Watch out, man!
So poor, but nothing in the head,
man! Fuck!
- The refrigerator into the bathroom.
- Halt, Amandus!
Either this scrap comes
in the barn
or in your room,
but only in there.
Departure, guys!
Here. We have forgotten.
Thank you.
Everything back.
It's good.
You are the one for me.
Amandus, reach me the bread?
- Ye, ye.
- Amandus?
The bread.
The bread.
What about it?
Thanks, but I've actually
asked your father.
Amandus, please stop.
- That is really annoying.
- Mom!
- It is true.
- Nothing you can do here.
- At home more was going on.
- Then Schnalz halt further.
- I'm almost done.
- Now I no longer want.
- A pity.
- Themselves to blame.
Boring.
Tell us the story of how
you've met granny.
I think not.
Then you tell us about
the story of...
Here... your boss.
How did you meet?
Where your father know that from?
I told it to him.
Great.
- Niko?
- Hm?
You want not to hear,
but your father is more than
a little confused.
My father's fine.
Can we sleep now?
I'm not in the mood.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
The good life is so stupid,
that can't explain anything.
That's right,
that's so rough as a screw.
- Screw ist  not to say.
- Then just cucumbers peeler.
What is cucumbers peeler?
One who peels cucumbers all day.
Want some coffee?
Grandpa, I'm only eleven.
True.
Also no longer the youngest.
Want some coffee?
Yes, very much.
I love coffee.
Grandpa, you need to fill it
with water.
Should I help you?
Not necessary.
I have ever made coffee.
It's already warm.
It's almost done.
Just stand briefly.
- Can you help us?
- Yes.
No, that... that I can't.
That we haven't in school.
We have the fractions left
always out.
You've left them out?
It's also much smarter.
I agree.
Thank you.
It was absolutely beautiful.
Bye!
The important and difficult
on such a...
- You're pretty.
- ...Throu...
- Let's...
- ...is that you can...
...take a coffee?
...or ask a question.
I'm not a showstar.
And I show myself as I am.
- Away! Go away, you!
- Except for the powdered nose.
- Away! Get away!
- Amandus?
- You cut the hedge?
- I can do that.
Great. Bring it only in the form.
Just ten centimeters.
- Can you do it?
- No problem.
Ten centimeters. Sandra.
- Sarah.
- Also nice.
Oh, my God.
Shit.
What are-  you doing?
- I'm shortening the... the...
The green thing here.
I said ten centimeters!
Yes, here. Exactly.
So...
If you ask me,
I think that higher is nicer.
I'd better leave the stump?
Or should I cut it?
Your decision.
Where is Amandus?
When you live together
under one roof,
you can keep at least
the meal times.
He tried to repair the fence.
Repair the hedge?
Five years it took
until it was so high.
Five fucking years!
Mom! Don't say "fucking"!
It's true.
Sorry, sweetheart.
Who knows what
will he break next time?
We order saturday a new hedge, ok?
Where did you get it from?
From your garden.
Do you like it?
- You want to provoke me.
- No.
I want to apologise.
- Sandra, I'm sorry, that...
- Sarah.
...I have sheared Sarah wrong.
Ahn...
...I have not cut properly...
- The...
- Hedge.
- The hedge...
- Great, Amandus!
If now I get my guests,
they'll see no good hoe more, but...
the garden gnomes from the neighbors.
And when they enter the garden,
then...
Many thanks! Well done!
Elisabeth liked roses very much.
Dad, mom said Margarethe.
Then just daisies.
- Tell me a story.
- A story?
Of you and dad.
When he was my age.
You make questions.
Do you remember when we
were camping? In the garden.
To make this more exciting,
grandpa told me
that at night our garden was full
of raccoons and foxes.
We caught up with
shovel and broom  handle
and all armed out of the shed,
so we definitely go
to the tent from the house.
Yes, you... ahn.
- You took the angel.
- Then you can remember?
How could I forget that?
As when you could chase
a raccoon with a fishing rod.
And when we were in the tent,
because I hear a funny noise.
Then a whine.
Dad said: "A raccoon".
Then I said:
"Raccoons don't cry!"
Then he said:
"The ones here in Brandenburg do it."
To this day I really don't know
if there are howling raccoons.
- It was me.
- No!
You never told me.
You've never asked me.
Today I was at a doctor.
He wants to examine you.
Why?
- Because...
- Because I'm an idiot?
Do you think I don't realize it?
Dad, you're not an idiot.
Sure I am.
- I don't go to the doctor.
- Maybe he can help.
You sound like your mother.
She wanted too to go
with you to the doctor?
I don't know anymore.
But he can't help me.
So far as I know.
Do you think better that one
in brown or that in beige?
- Beige.
- Really?
Then take the brown.
- You haven't watched.
- I have other things to worry,
like our garden party.
Have you talked to Amandus?
- Yes, but he doesn't want.
- How?
- He wants no examination.
- And then?
And nothing!
I can't force him.
How can I explain that to him?
As you have explained to me
with his stuff.
Not at all.
He has Alzheimer's.
He needs help.
He cannot make the rules.
Take him by the hand
and walk with him to the doctor.
He also can't live here
permanently.
He is totally confused.
We don't have the time
to take care of him.
- I must go to London tomorrow.
- And who brings Tilda to the doctor?
- I have my pitch.
- Dad.
- You're joking.
- I'm not.
I explained everything to him
and make him a little map.
A little map?
- Brown or beige?
- Brown.
Man, Niko, we have
just talked about it.
Do you think he can bring
Tilda to the doctor?
That never works.
What are you doing?
I'm doing... clean.
Do you think to pick me up
tomorrow from school
and to go with me
to the pediatrician?
- I have it on the screen.
- For sure?
Certainly.
What do you want
to do with it?
- I am Berta.
- Hello, Beate.
- Where will we go tomorrow?
- To the pediatrician.
That I know.
It was just a joke.
- He, dad. Where are you now?
- London. I told you already.
- It's all right?
- Grandad has picked you up?
And?
How ist the weather in London?
The sun shines here.
- Grandad has picked you up?
- We are already there.
- Where?
- In the doctor.
- Can I talk to him a minute?
- With the doctor?
No, with grandpa.
Ahn, he is filling the form.
Grandpa is filling out the form?
Yes.
Okay.
Come on, give him to me once.
- Ahn.
It's our turn now.
Ciao!
To the airport, please.
Hi, I have an appointment.
Ah, yes.
- Tilda Rosenbach?
- Yes.
- You are late.
- Yeap.
Are you all alone here?
Whom you take with
if you have a doctor's appointment?
Mm, that sounds good.
Everything okay.
May you put on the stockings?
Yes.
Can I ask you something?
Of course you can ask me something.
What is Alzheimer's?
- Why do you want to know that?
- My grandpa has hat, I believe.
And how you get on it?
- My mom told me that.
- Is your mom doctor?
No, she work at an advertising agency.
Do you see?
Then tell me something
about your grandpa.
He confuses things?
He forgets it?
Sometimes.
That also happens to me sometimes.
It is quite normal at my age.
Ahn.
Ah.
So, my beauty. I have
your favorite cake cooked.
Ups.
I must have forgotten it
in the kitchen. I...
I'll be right back.
Just imagine,
all the books here
are the brain of your grandad.
And there falls now,
due to the disease,
every now and then a book.
At the moment
your grandpa has forgotten
what is written in the book.
Depending on the day
it tuns out
one or the other book also
take down.
Then another falls.
Yes.
And in the course of the disease
there are always more.
And at last, tipping the books
completely out of the shelf.
Until one day...
Until he knows nothing about?
Until he knows nothing.
What can I do for that
he gets better?
What your grandpa needs now
is lots of love from you.
And understanding.
When he says or does things
that don't make sense,
you need to make him feel
that you understand him.
And you have to give him tasks.
Yes, that's very important for him.
So that he feels that he is needed.

Sep 15th, 2015
Ah.
What should I do now?
Funny.
What makes you say in there?
Ah... Oh.
Amandus? Oh God!
- What happened?
- I'm cooking a cacke.
Oh God!
Don't move from the spot.
Fuck!
I'm so sorry.
It will be all right, all right.
Do you think you can
eat the cake yet?
- Certainly.
- Want a piece?
I...
I need to lose weight.
- Then I'll throw it away.
- No.
Don't do that.
That can't.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for my honey.
- Have you cooked?
- No, your father.
Try it.
It tastes good.
- That you have not tried.
- Well. Amandus sake.
It was beautiful in London?
- What's happening?
- He has not picked Tilda up.
- How so? He has.
- No.
She just said that,
so as not to betray him.
Could not care less.
I told you, that doesn't work.
And he almost burned
the whole house.
- What happened then?
- Look at it.
If I come home later,
you were in a ruin standing.
And you could identify Amandus
at its teeth.
Luckily Tilda went to the doctor,
but what about the next time,
when Tilda remains alone
with grandpa at home?
Because that could happen,
and that's your fault.
Because you deny the truth.
Because you don't take
Amandus to the doctor
and still cut off to London.
You had to move the pitch.
No! You pick her to the doctor,
that was the deal.
I am employed, you don't.
I can't say Serge:
"How about us after tomorrow?"
What you mean by "us"?
Your breasts?
What are you doing now?
- Tell me.
Was the rascal satisfied
with your breasts?
- Great.
- I'm sorry.
Amandus, can you close
the toilet door after use?
And then was finally
summer vacation.
Mom wanted to go
with us to Sweden,
but grandpa didn't want to.
Mom tried to persuade him,
but no chance.
Then she flew with her mom
to Mallorca.
And I had grandpa all summer
for me alone.
We were quite often walk.
In good weather dad drove
grandad and me to the lake.
The other children found grandpa super.
They didn't care he was different
from other grandads.
Dr. Ehlers says that
Alzheimer people
remember best the things
that are long ago,
and that they like
if they can think of the stuff again.
That is why we have always
looked at his photo album
from Venice.
And although
I can recite his stories
in his sleep,
it was every time so beautiful,
so happy to him to see it.
I've already shown it?
No.
Funny.
I could have sworn...
Grandpa, show it!
Here, Lido,
here we had a big disagreement
with the life... ãhn...
With the lifemat...
With the wald...
No, with the lifeguard.
Because Margarethe wanted
to bathe always naked.
How did you talk to him?
Parlo italiano perfettamente,
la mia principessa.
What does "I love you, grandpa"
in Italian?
Ti amo, nonno.
Ti amo, nonno.
Where is that?
That's the...
This is the... Ahn.
the doge... Ahn.
Man, man, man.
There was a lot of seagulls.
Grandma always liked them.
Until it had shat
on the mozzarella caprese.
- A seagull?
- Right in the middle of the food.
What do you mean
that grandma did?
- Cried?
- Laughed.
And then the same pigeon
has crapped again upside down.
I miss grandma.
Me too.
I'm curious to see how she looks
when we meet again.
What do you mean
"when you see her again"?
When I die,
we meet again in heaven.
I don't want you to die.
Oh, when I die,
there's a big party in heaven.
With all the trimmings.
When Margarethe and me
are beck together,
we mix the load up there
right on.
I don't believe in heaven,
but it was sweet that
he was trying to comfort me.
Actually I must comfort him.
I started do film grandpa
many times.
When he doesn't remember
anything more,
I believe he'll feel better so.
Like when mom and dad
show me the film,
as I ran for the first time.
How does it feel actually?
- What?
- When you forget everything.
As...
honey in my head. So...
So glued.
How long have you
honey in your head?
Since I can not think anymore.
But I have...
I have...
That doesn't matter, because I...
Can you tell me...
I can't.
Here.
- What is that?
- There's everything
that I need to keep.
That she had... here, ahn...
No
- ...grandma had done.
- Can I do it?
Yes.
Granny knew actually in advance
that she was dying?
That...
That I had to be written.
She is dead, right?
Yes, grandpa.
I knew it.
And now a toast
to our dear Amandus, hm?
Toast?
I have one loaf.
But we want to drink to you.
- Amandus?
- I have no thirst.
- Crap thing.
- We are trying.
We drink now to you,
on your birthday.
I'm not thirsty.
Alzheimer, or what?
Please. Aioli for all of us.
Say, what are you doing?
Olive oil is...
good for the skin.
- Have you already voted?
- SPD, as always.
Willy Brandt,
this is my man.
I may not vote here,
but if I could,
I would take that too.
Certainly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Does it get any louder?
That's disgusting!
Bother please
to your own business.
Thank you.
Do you know who I am?
- Hm?
- Who is that?
- Something like an actor.
- Sorry.
We played together in the sandbox?
Or why are you bothering me?
- Yes...
-The man is sick.
- Then he should stay at home.
- There's the door.
Now listen to me!
- I want to talk to the chef.
- That's me, you idiot.
Now get out.
I don't need your money.
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Have a good evening.
- Then.
- So, I take the Dorade.
With the green asparagus.
Al dente.
- And the lady?
- The tuna tartare, please.
- And for you?
- Spaghetti with butter, please.
Ah, good choice.
Specialty of the house.
- And the Lord?
- Which Lord?
What you want to eat, dad.
That.
Yes...
- With pleasure.
- Since when you eat liver?
I don't know.
Then what I eat?
Mozzarella caprese?
Mozza... what?
- Twice buffalo mozzarella.
- Good. Ready soon.
Do not cry, dad.
Hey, everything is good.
Hm?
Dad...
Grandpa, what is it?
it feels so...
dr... dr... dr...
Bad?
...dre...
...dreadful...
...hideously bad.
When you just know nothing.
All empty.
When you want something
write down and...
it does not go.
Something in you that
just doesn't work.
Do you remember
what you wanted to write?
You write.
"For Tilda,
my beloved..."
Uh. "My beloved..."
Granddaughter?
I say what is written.
Okay.
"There will come a day...
where I do not..." Ahn.
"...where I do not remember,
who you...
...you are.
You... You...
It may even happen that...
In any case, I want you
to know one thing.
I love you
and you are
the best princess
that I could wish."
Come clear, old
Come clear, old
Come, come clear
Do not even at gangster
Do you know?
You come
and made a stress
But you danced ballet
You are one...
But why you make that
Not long to a super...
Come clear, old!
Come clear!
Now sit down!
He is ill?
Mr. Rosenbach, please.
Yes, it's me.
Or you? You go rather.
- Sit down.
- No, that's okay.
I want to talk with you.
Dr. Holst.
- Holz?
- Holst.
With "st".
- How are you today?
- You asked that already.
No.
- So?
- So what?
How are you today?
You have just wondered.
That's true.
And? What is your answer?
About what?
On the question
of how are you today.
You have no other question in stock?
- It's slowly boring.
- Who brought you here?
My parents.
It may be that
it's your grandchild?
Yes. That comes out.
Do you know how old she is?
Oh, she still has a lot going on.
Do you know how old she is?
No.
I don't know how old I was
when you came to us.
Ahn.
Then you were 61.
Mr. Rosenbach.
How much is nine plus three?
You don't know
what makes nine plus three?
- And you are a doctor?
- Yes.
Now I have a question.
What color is a fridge inside?
- Mr. Rosenbach...
- Reply.
- White.
- And what drink a cow?
- Milch.
- No, a cow drinks water.
Well, that was good, right?
Yes.
Now please excuse me, ok?
Where are you going?
I'm busy.
I want to finish our conversation.
Yes, my...
The assistant...
She... She makes an appointment for you.
Now I have a OP.
Mom and grandpa agreed
that grandpa stays stays in the room
at the celebration,
if he is allowed to see the big
fireworks at midnight.
The woman that is talking to mom
is Nora.
Daddy doesn't like her
because she said
Mama was not cheating,
but was just trying
to save her marriage.
The one who goes so funny here
is Serge,
the one of the Christmas party.
He likes dad even less.
Dad always says to mom,
when he sees him, that he hits him.
Dad has boxed him sometimes,
so I just wonder
why mom has actually invited him.
Serge. What are you doing here?
That was some kind of greeting?
- Niko know about it.
- What?
- Why that?
- I told him.
Shit, you gotta tell me.
- I would never have come.
- You're not invited.
I noticed.
I thought you had forgotten me.
- I clarify that with him.
- No, you must go immediately.
Shit!
- Why did she tell him that?
- Because she is stupid.
- What do you look like?
- I have made myself...
pretty.
And what are you doing there?
I eat these little...
...these k... knubbel there.
Here, that, ahn... salt.
- Did you have it all in your mouth?
- They are excellent.
Hm?
This is my party.
Today you are not
on the guest list.
That we discussed already.
Please go to your room.
- But...
- The soldier obeys.
- Yes, but...
- Hello, Amandus!
- Nothing good.
- How good to see you.
You look so elegant.
Do we...
- Do we know each other?
- Have you already forgotten?
You worried today
five times for me.
Only five times?
Horny saying!
Amandus is back.
- Oh, you old soldier.
-Yes.
- No, we are celebrating now.
- Mom, let him.
- Then we both drink.
- It's just bad.
Serge. Piss off now.
If you take three,
you get one free.
Okay, I'll take three.
Hats off. Great music.
I agree.
Earlier we had LPs.
Hey, I need more fuses!
- Niko, I have a problem.
- What?
Please don't turn around.
- Why should I?
- Promise to me?
- I promise.
- Serge is here.
- Where?
- Yes, here.
- You cannot be serious.
- I am.
- He came to my celebration!
- Our celebration.
- I didn't invite him.
- He should fuck off.
No, he is my boss.
Okay, I talk to him.
Niko, my dear.
- Serge...
- No, no, no.
- Serge...
- You wonder safely.
I was not invited...
Niko!
Serge, I'm so sorry.
I can understand him.
That with your wife
was a huge stupidity!
Where ist the discjockey?
The russians are coming.
- What, Dad?
- I love you.
That you've never told me.
I ever tell you how much I love you?
If, then...
I've forgotten it.
Don't take it personally.
Where is Sandra?
She moved to her mum
for a few days.
- Why that?
- Dad.
Have you fought?
- Don't you know anything?
- No.
- All gone.
- Oh.
- I...
- Dad...
There is only...
e hole.
We don't know how
the disease develops.
A long stabilization may be followed
by rapid deterioration.
Good thing that he's so humorous.
When in doubt,
he remembers old jokes,
even if he don't know how
one leg is in front of the other.
You must answer the following question:
"Are you spiritually and temporarilly
in a position to look after him?"
If you should one day come
to the conclusion
that you no longer care for him
as it would be necessary
in your view,
then use your sincerity
with your father.
I know what you're going through.
My father was also demented.
I know the struggle with yourself.
The helplessness, the bad conscience,
the self-reproach.
But in the end of the way
the hospitalization is inevitable.
Try to reserve a place.
Good nursing homes, unfortunately,
have very long waiting times.
- Chaleema, Tea and Coffee.
- Hello, Pam.
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Super, little mouse.
- Can I speak to Dad?
- He is looking at a home for Grandad.
It's not true.
No one is initially excited to live here.
But they get used to it.
Check out the two.
They know themselves since yesterday
and are holding hands already.
They have a regulated day,
what is extremely important,
and they don't need be ashamed,
because the are among themselves.
Hello!
That can't be.
I am Hildegard.
- You can also say Gerdi.
- Okay.
We already know ourselves for a while.
No, we don't.
but I'm Niko Rosenbach.
We could fuck a bit?
- No, no, no.
- Only a tiny bit?
Hildegard, now let it be good, ok?
Can you think about it a bit?
Yes...
Even the desire ofr sexuality
is an issue in Alzheimer's.
Also here.
In some less pronounced.
In Hildegard it comes
about anything else.
The history is important.
Hildegard was a dancer in...
- Or there.
- ...a bar.
So, at least, her daughter describes
the professional show.
Yes...
How do I explain to him
that he has to live somewhere else?
Not at all.
He won't understand it.
Like a little child
who comes to kindergarten.
They howl and scream.
They have a bad impression,
but soon they will not want
to leave there.
It will be good for him.
Hello, Dad.
- Dad?
- Yes?
I'm on the toilet
and have no paper.
Do you can bring me paper?
Here.
Thanks.
- What?
- Where were you, anyway?
- In the office and then shopping.
- Shopping.
- Yes.
- Und where are your bags?
- In the car.
- You were not shopping.
- You also were not in the office.
- Yes.
Tell no shit.
Pam told me that you was looking
for a home for Ganddad.
- Oh, the stupid nut.
- Can you go now?
Don't you see
that I need to poop?
I would never put you in an asylum
when you're old.
I hate you!
Grandpa, what are you thinking now?
- Grandpa?
- Venice.
Tell me again how the dove
has crapped on the Grandma's mozzarella.
Grandma and me always
wanted to go there with you.
When you grow up.
To...
To show you where we...
...we...
Did you actually know
that Hamburg has more bridges
than Venice?
- I don't believe that.
- Must we look at ourselves?
- Where?
- In Venice.
Hm?
I cannot even find the way to...
...to Dingsbums.
And what if we go together?
I'm good for nothing more.
Niko. It was about time.
- Can I talk to Sarah?
She is sleeping.
- She is sleeping? At the time?
- Yes.
She has not slept the last few nights.
May I come in?
- Why don't you contact me?
- I'm not cut down.
Park no counter-questions,
you stupid macho!
You have her party crashed
and made sure
that everyone really knows
about the matter with Serge.
- Super move.
- I'm so sorry.
- Say that to her.
- How,
if you don't let me in?
- How are Amandus?
- Shit.
How is the little mouse?
Shit too,
that is why I'm here.
Nice that you're here.
I'm sorry.
Please, then go on.
Mom!
- Why is Grandpa with you?
- He had a bad dream.
The Russians are coming.
Do you know that
you're a great girl?
- I'm proud of you.
- Is that why you cut down?
- Have you read the letter?
- Yes.
But you cannot hidy easily.
You know, I went...
to my mother, because...
...because I was so desperate.
- I didn't know.
- You brak up?
No.
Your Dad and me,
we love each other.
At least something.
Dad is sad because you said
you hate him.
I tried to comfort him
and said that we women
sometimes do not mean it.
I mean it.
- He puts Grandpa in an asylum.
- Sweetheart...
You know that I can take care of him.
Tilda,
you have to go back to school
and Dad and me work.
He has the home just watched.
Yes, because he wants
to take him there.
Now Grandpa is still with us.
But at some point
he is so ill
that no longer works here.
Then he needs a nice home,
where he probably feels right.
Yes, where we can always visit him
and pick him up,
take nice things with him.
You and Dad work always.
- Then we work less.
- For sure.
I promise you.
"I promise you."
Mom and Dad often promise
to work less,
and do it never.
Smylla has said:
"The worst thing
that parents can make
is to break promises to their children."
I was awake all night
and thought about
what Dr. Ehlers said.
And about Grandpa
and that he needs a job.
Grandpa?
Grandpa, wake up.
- Are they back?
- No, they are sleeping.
Good.
When the enemy sleeps, we are safe.
I agree.
We are now conquering Italy.
I need to practice.
- No, you are in vacation.
- Ah, yes.
I unpack your things quickly.
Out in ten minutes.
What are you waiting for?
Drive off.
- You have to drive.
- Ahn.
Now I habe even forgotten
how to turn the thing.
You need to put the feet
on the coupling.
Try again.
It purrs like a kitten.
Now the gas.
Oh.
There are burglars who steal our car.
- That was the reverse.
- No shit, Grandpa.
Hey!
I change gears
and you put your feet, okay?
Okay.
- Wake up!
- Ey!
Hey!
Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going to?
Try it.
Grandpa!
- Grandpa, it's red!
- We get it.
- That was close.
- Grandpa, what are you doing?
Green means stop...
With red, you must go.
Go on, Grandpa.
- At right?
- At left.
Left is the station, Grandpa.
Hey! Hey, stay where you are.
Hey!
That's not it.
HH for Hamburg.
Anthrazit. I told you.
Yes. Simply stolen from the farm.
We're not here in Naples.
Italy.
Okay.
Humans.
Ah, are monsieur already woken up?
Buttered toast anyone?
Fresh orange juice?
Don't you have other problems?
Amandus and Tilda are gone.
- Don't rip me off.
- I 'm not kidding.
- Preliminary investigation?
Yes.
- More is not possible?
- No.
- Yes, friend and helper.
- Sweetheart.
Your father drove away
with your daughter in the car.
Should we start the helicopter search
with thermal imaging cameras?
- Hello?
- He grows up.
- This is not the case for us.
- His father has dementia.
- And our daughter is eleven.
- Yes, you've said that already.
We will contact you.
The two are safe at home.
That has been my experience.
- Two tickets to Venice.
- One-way?
No, for my Grandpa too.
- I mean: with return?
- What's cheaper?
One-way.
- Then twice.
- Your old one?
No, my Grandpa.
- How old are you?
- Oh, eleven.
Eleven?
- Then you travel for free.
- Super!
That will be 224 Euros, please.
Grandpa, have you money here?
- You need to enter the PIN.
- Ahn.
- Grandpa?
- 1916.
- Sure?
- The Battle of Verdun.
The Battle of Verdun?
First World War.
You did great, Grandpa.
Many thanks.
Well,
good trip and lots of fun in Venice.
How does he know
where we want to go?
It's here.
I... I must... I...
I must... I...
- What you need?
- It has gone.
Not bad.
It's already happened to me.
We have to change clothers here.
- I forgot the pants?
- That can not...
- I don't believe it.
- Shit.
Shit.
I can help you, Grandpa.
What's?
- I have heard that.
- That was not me.
- Sure, Grandpa.
- It was not really me.
Finished!
I swore that I would never do that.
Today I spoke at length
with Dr. Ehlers about Grandpa
and on Alzheimer's
and about happiness and joy.
The most important for your brain
is joy.
That's the number one fertilizer.
It repairs the brain.
Dr. Ehlers says you can
achieve yours objectives only
if yoy make them with joy.
But many old people
have no more goals,
because they make no joy
and no one is proud of them.
Nobody needs them.
That's why they get sick,
because their brain atrophies.
And they can't be repaired,
because they don't have fun.
May be Mom and Dad should have
visited Grandma and Grandpa more often.
But that was not possible,
'cause they have to work so much.
As Granny then died,
Grandpa has lost its ultimate task.
But if I succeed,
giving Grandpa a task
and he has the feeling
that I need him for,
then perhaps he will get well.
I just don't know that.
- Good evening.
- Ahn.
Berta is tired.
- Where are you dare to sleep?
Where we can lie down?
Here forward.
I'm back.
I love your breasts.
Margarethe...
- Old man's pleasure!
-What's happening?
He wanted to rape me!
- And you like it.
- Oh.
He has taken my breasts.
My Grandpa was in the wrong compartment.
- He has Alzheimer's.
- Oh.
Ahn, here... ahn.
Alois. Alois Alzheimer.
Thomas.
Thomas Mueller.
Three goals against Portugal.
Could you friendly ask the lady
our Portugal...
- ...to leave our compartment?
- Ahn.
This is not your compartment.
That's the compartment of the lady.
- This is your compartment?
- Mm.
Then, ahn...
We were pleased.
By the way,
Your wife...
She touches so wonderfully soft.
Thank you for the compliment.
Did you hear, sweetheart?
- Here, Grandpa.
- What?
So... ahn...
Sorry to bother you.
Good night.
Please.
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad,
I hope you're fine.
Don't worry about us.
Ahn, can you tell me where
is the bathroom?
Here.
- You have chips in hair.
- Do you want to have one?
Thanks.
Ahn.
Toilet.
Oh, shit!
Grandpa!
That can't be.
Hello?
Here.
Maybe better we give up?
We're going to Venice!
- I could slow them down.
- Grandpa!
Hey!
We are closed.
- Che cazzo!
- Vaffanculo, porca puttana.
Wrong door.
- That way, Grandpa.
- Yes, I...
Cute.
We wait until they're gone.
The pretty women?
No, the police.
I have to pee.
Good.
Grandpa.
I need to go to the toilet.
Aha.
- But sit down.
- Yes, Grandpa.
Grandma hs ever sat down.
- It's not true.
- Yep.
Grandpa and me are sitting in the train,
but you'll see that.
We ate breakfast also.
Chips, because they are healthy.
She's sweet, the little one.
Yes. It's a train compartment.
- And now?
- This can be anywhere.
- Somewhere in a train!
- That's it.
The colleagues of the railway police
how to deal with the problem.
They are reporting.
- Believe me, Mrs...
- Rosenbach.
Rosenbach.
See you when I have something positive.
Both are doing well
and are having lots of fun.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Who's there?
The mayor.
Can you open the door, please?
I...
I can't. I...
I get not the thing...
Here, the thing...
Turn the latch to the right.
- To the right.
- I don't know, how...
- Grandpa, is this the police?
- No.
The mayor.
That was a joke. I'm Erdal.
I'll just clean here.
You're the girl with the grandfather
who has Alzheimer's.
Who has Alzheimer's?
- How do you know?
- We are here in Bolzano.
You're 'breaking news'.
What have you been up to?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
You have pulled the emergency brake
and messed up the schedule.
It was an emergency.
I almost lost Grandpa.
Well, it didn't work.
Where did you come from?
- From Hamburg.
- Hamburg. Me too.
- Real?
- Yes, born and raised.
- What do I do with you?
- Can you help us?
Schooling fish stick together.
What are you doing?
I cannot kip.
Come do bed.
It's four o'clock early.
- Are you still looking for your honey?
- Yes, why?
Come over here,
you got to see this.
I habe asked him five times
if he saw it.
Do you know what he said?
"I'm allergic to honey."
- Well. That's really brazen.
- Shall I fetch us wine?
Dark here.
Attention, bulls.
- Bulls?
- Psst!
Are you crazy?
"Muh!" makes the cow.
"Muh!" makes the cow.
Muh, muh!
Questo è un idiota.
Porto giuda!
What do you think if I cancel?
But you love your job.
I want to be there for Tilda
and Amandus.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
I would find really great.
I should have done it long before.
I should tell you greetings from Serge.
- He is very grateful to you.
- Why that?
He has now a new front tooth
with a diamond in it,
claiming that he would have
more impact in women.
- I don't believe that.
- Mm.
Yep.
Look yourself.
That's not true, hey.
Hi, I'm Erdal, I am...
Hi, I am Erdal,
born in 1983 in the Schanzenviertel,
but not german,
but foreigner from third generation,
although my German is super.
What do you want to tell us?
If my parents came from Sudeten,
I was a German.
I find it simply unfair.
Anyway, now I am at home
in South Tyrol.
A real South Tyrolean dog.
It was a mess...
Come to the point.
Okay.
What is your mother's name?
- Ahn, Sandra.
- Sandra. Good.
Dear Sandra, dear Niko,
your charming daughter
is doing brilliantly.
Don't worry, because,
when he here with she here
be in the city of love,
- they call.
- Super.
- Real? Thank you.
- We'll do it all again.
What?
Better i cannot do.
Und bang, gone.
Then...
SMS tone.
- Did you sent it already?
- Mm.
- Great.
- You said: "Super".
- The emphasis wasn't clear?
- No.
- Now they know our goal.
- City of Love.
- It could be Paris.
- For sure.
From Hamburg via South Tyrol
to Paris.
You can go through the Black Forest
from Berlin to Hamburg,
it is also nice.
Hey, there is he!
Hello! Here!
...in the City of Love,
they call.
They are going to Venice.
- Madness.
- That's his job.
Buenas noches, amigo!
Hello!
"Buenos dias."
"Noches" means night.
- There is no moon.
- Clearly, Professor.
These are my passengers?
- Yes.
Hi, I am Emre.
Your getaway driver.
Well, then go up in your limo.
They come together to Venice?
Sure, they never were there.
- We can sit in front?
- There you can be seen.
Avanti!
Close the borders.
- There is no EU-borders more.
- Was a joke.
Ah so.
- Thank you, Erdal.
- Take good care of your Grandpa.
You're a great girl.
I'm proud of you.
Thanks for Grandpa's pants.
Of course no problem.
I have enough of it.
So I think it's a sensation.
- Hello, Mom.
- A sensation, the little one.
- That she had of me.
- Why so good mood?
Because I think it's great
what she's doing.
Really. Sensational.
Don't pull such a face.
I also think it's great.
- But I'm worried.
- Tilda is wise.
She's intended already there.
If you did it sometimes quite good,
get out of here.
We'll contact you.
Let me konw when they sign up.
Yes! Aye, aye!
I drink on you.
Have fun, you two!
Where is Calvados?
Here it smells.
Oh, I love this smell.
You're a fine girl. Hm?
How do you know that it's a girl?
I recognize her face.
But she has eggs.
- Where?
- At least not on the face.
- Fuck!
- What's?
Police!
Shit.
What can I do for you?
Papers.
With pleasure.
What do you look for?
What, ahn, do you...
Cosa trasporta?
- Sheep.
- Cosa?
- Pecore?
- Oui, oui.
- I can go now?
- No.
Come down.
Have you never seen a sheep?
Come down.
Please.
They... They smell pretty strict.
Get out.
- Come down.
- Now?
Non domani, non dopodomani...
Now!
That ist as... bewitched.
She is damn smart, the little one.
The sheep, I mean.
I don't know what,
but I'll find it out
and I'll call you.
Have you a card?
Welcome to the Bauer Hotel.
How long do you want to stay?
- We don't know yet.
- What?
I only have two suites free.
- Then we take a suite.
- Mm.
Ecco qua.
Numero 558.
Very beautiful.
But the price is, however,...
- 1800.
- For a night?
Then we look for another hotel.
Ey, just imagine,
there're Lire.
- We take the suite.
- Bene.
A signature, please.
You will not regret it.
Already, in this suite,
many bambini have been fathered.
We have no more bread.
There are so many comic strokes.
How are you supposed
to find the way?
We can share the apple.
You can keep it.
- I have more desire to sheep.
- Sheep?
We could catch one.
We won't eat a sheep!
Ts.
Only a very small?
Half of one?
- Half of a little one?
- Get half of an apple.
Ah.
Have you actually afraid to be dead?
Grandpa?
No.
Me, yes.
Well, you still have a few days left.
No, I mean, I'm afraid when you're dead.
You don't need to.
Up there I'll take care of you
with Grandma.
Watch out.
We will be so proud of you.
Anf if you miss me,
then look up
at me
and just then I'm with you.
Did you say something?
I only said that it is so nice
to be with you.
Can I help you?
We are hungry.
I would love to give you these tomatoes,
but they are for the Vegetable Market
in Bolzano.
Come with me.
On behalf of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, amen.
Come, Lord Jesus,
be our guest
and bless what you have
graciously given us.
So, on tomato salad with onion
I had a bit more appe...
- ...thus, had lust.
- Grandpa.
The tomatoes are for sale
at the market.
- We live on it.
- On the market?
That reminds me a thing.
The nun said to the farmers
who were serving the vegetables:
"I would like a cucumber."
Then the farmer said:
"Take two, then you can eat one."
I don't understand.
What is there you don't understand?
When the nun eat one,
then she can the other...
Save it for the next day.
What are you doing here
the whole day?
Can I briefly explain my joke?
No, Grandpa.
It's true that you are allowed
to not have sex?
Yes, my child.
- We are chaste.
- I said it. Cucumber.
Aua.
Chaste?
What is it?
We refrain from love a man.
We leave this space free for God.
So you're all married,
so to speak, with God?
Mm, you could say that.
Then no one
can be jealous or unfaithful.
Can my parents visit you
here once?
Why do you ask that, my child?
I think they could learn
a lot from you.
In purgatory you have the chance
to prove yourself.
Only then God decides
whether you go to heaven.
Do you believe in heaven?
Of course.
Heaven makes our lives perfect.
When we die, we live
all together with God.
Do you think my Grandpa goes to heaven?
In all this that you've told
about your grandfather,
I'm quite sure.
- For real?
- Yes.
You're a good girl.
And the way you're going,
it's special.
- Looking for something, Grandpa?
- Ahn, Elisa, ahn...
Margarethe.
- She was just still there.
- He means Grandma.
She is in heaven already.
Come on, Grandpa,
we're going to look for her.
I think I saw her over there.
I think she's over there.
Grandma?
Gretchen?
Grandma?
Gretchen?
Grandma, ist that you?
She has well hidden.
Grandma?
Where is she?
We find her.
Grandma?
- Grandpa.
- Yes?
- I found her.
- Where?
- Here.
- Ah.
My God, how beautiful you are.
I'v missed you so.
Here I slept with Grandma.
For sure?
Fairly.
1800?
Ahn, I'm very sorry.
It's our last room.
It's only Lire.
Something like...
two Marks.
And you pay with cash
or by credit card?
Grazie.
Numero?
The Battle of Verdun?
Verdun?
Grazie. Allora...
557.
Questo è...
A signature, please.
Why exactly have all Italians
- a mustache?
- Ahn?
Because they want to look
like their mothers.
Like their mothers!
Grazie.
Hm.
Who is this?
Who?
He there.
There is you, Grandpa.
That are you and that's me.
Tilda.
Look, I...
I make all to copy.
Look that.
There, again.
Look at that.
First you need get the toothbrush out.
That way.
Use the toothpaste
to brush your teeth.
That is to shave.
Mouth upwards.
You're going great, Grandpa.
That tickles the nose.
You're the funniest adult I know.
From you
I can still learn so much.
Nonsense, Grandpa.
You may just no more unlearn.
It was nice to be with you today.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night.
It sounds crazy,
but I feel
that they are very close to us.
It was nice to be with you today.
Today?
We were a team, like before.
- Thanks to our daughter.
- Right.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Do you hear the birds?
But that sounds not good.
Where is it, my good, huh?
Relax, Brown.
They are green.
That you say about horses.
Ah.
Can I do anything for you?
I've been doing it.
I'm a doctor.
Uhu.
I still have to laugh
at your joke.
- Joke?
- Yes. Ahn...
"Mom!"
The previous joke.
That was nice.
He was good, really good.
That was incredible.
What was I supposed to do now?
Ah, yes.
Where's going to the beach?
- The beach is in Lido.
- That I know.
But you can't go now.
It's the middle of the night.
- Have you seen my Grandpa?
- Grandpa?
- Ahn... Nonno?
- Ah. Non conosco tuo nonno.
Ma il portiere di notte mi ha
detto che un ospite anziano
è andato
nel bel mezzo della notte...
- Al Lido.
- Lido?
Sì, brava. Lido.
Piano, ragazzina.
- Buongiorno!
- Buongiorno!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
- Stop! Stop!
- Non mi posso fermare qua.
No!
No! Fermati!
No! Fermati!
Dove vai?
Prendi il salvagente!
Torna indietro adesso!
Trank God, here you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Grandpa?
You mean me?
Don't bullshit, Grandpa.
I've scared me enough,
when you weren't at the hotel.
I't me.
Tilda, your granddaughter.
I don't know.
I'm your little princess.
We both called Rosenbach
and have come here together.
You are my Grandpa.
- Let's go to the hotel.
- Leave me in peace.
Go away.
Go, go, go, go.
For Tilda,
my beloved granddaughter.
The day will come
when I won't know
that you're you.
Even though you must always
remember one thing.
I love you and you are
the best princess
I could ever wish for.
Shit.
Mom! Dad!
There are you.
Oh, my sweet.
I'm so proud of you.
Oh, my sweet.
Opa is sitting on the brench
and he no longer recognizes me.
Dad.
My God, it's beautiful here.
Do you remember, Dad?
Here you ate with Mom,
after your wedding.
- I'll help you...
- I can do it alone!
I'm no longer a child.
There's nothing here to drink?
I'm hungry.
Now come here.
So, put your mouth up.
Prego, signore?
- A forestry.
- Forestry? Non conosco forestry.
- No. Forestry.
- Una birra Forestry!
Certo. Subito.
Nine months later,
I got a little brother.
Mom had the idea
to call him Amandus.
As Grandpa.
Gradpa has, I believe,
no longer noticed.
He has repeatedly asked
how the boy is
and where he comes from.
But perhaps Grandpa
has noticed
that Mom and Dad
had more time for him.
Mom left the job
and she kept her promise
and is trying to work less.
First Grandpa was still with us.
A young woman helped us
to take care of Grandpa.
Grandpa liked her very much.
For sometime,
he can be fed only from her.
He found her very good
and also very talented.
But at some point
the young woman is gone
because Grandpa
too moved into her blouse.
But when Grandpa
came to the asylum,
we picked him up many times
and did things with him.
Mom and me always went
with him to the shopping
and ate honey ice cream.
Dad hat then to look after small Amandus.
Sometimes he tasted it
and sometimes not.
Then it was the ice too cold for him.
I was still a couple of times
at Dr. Ehlers.
And he told me
that people with Alzheimer's
feel more as we believe,
and that it's important
to spend time with them,
because they feel the affection.
Although we no longer can imagine.
On our last trip
was a huge thunderstorm.
It has been raining very hard,
as the sky was going to cry.
But we habe remained sitting

in cafe und laughed.
The next day,
his heart has stopped beating.
And I'm so glad
that I was there with him.
Actually I was every day with him,
just not when my tonsils
were taken out.
Coupled with heavy rainfall
and thunderstorms,
southwest winds bring end
of the week back
late summer temperatures.
Who cares anyway?
It's always the same anyway.
Not me.
What did you get
for a pretty...
pretty...
It's me, Grandpa. Tilda.
I know who you are.
You're my little princess.
Forever.
Take good care of him, granny.
I'll miss you, Grandpa.
God, You can do live
and take it up again.
Full trust in Your mercy
we take leave
of Amandus Rosenbach.
In full trust
we put him into Your earth.
We do this in the hope
that has given us Jesus Christ.
Earth to earth.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
Where is Tilda?
She didn't want to be here
when Grandpa is buried.
She is behind in the meadow.
We should pick her up
when it's all over.
Grandpa?
Did you say something?
