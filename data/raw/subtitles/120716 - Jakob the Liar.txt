Hitler goes to a fortune-teller
and asks...
''When will I die?''
And the fortune-teller replies...
''On a Jewish holiday. ''
Hitler then asks,
''How do you know that?''
And she replies, 'Any day you die
will be a Jewish holiday. ''
Curfew in half an hour.
So you ask me as a Jew...
''How could you tell a joke like that
at a time like that?''
That's how we survived...
and those were some of the things
that kept us going.
Everything else,
the Germans had taken.
They built high walls covered
in barbed wire to shut us in the ghetto.
We were isolated from the rest of
the world for years without any news.
So we relied on the little things--
a dark joke, a sunny day...
a hopeful rumor.
That's why I would go and sit
by the ghetto wall...
and look at the tree
where I first kissed Hannah.
And it was by that wall
that it all started.
With a single sheet of newspaper.
- Mama?
- No! It's too dangerous!
Where can she go?
- Mama?
- Hurry. Run.
Please leave. Go, go!
Darling!
We'll see you soon!
We love you, Lina!
Halt!
What are you doing there?
Trying to escape from the ghetto?
- Name!
-Jakob Heym.
Don't you know it's punishable
by death for a Jew...
to be in the streets after curfew?
You're right.
Of course you're right.
1 00% correct. But I don't think
the siren went off yet.
Oh, a smartJew.
Go over there.
Present yourself
to the offiicer on duty...
and tell him you were out
after 8..00.
- But it's not 8:00.
- Are you arguing?
- No.
- Go!
This is the radio
of the German Armed Forces Network.
Heil Hitler.
We will now broadcast
a special bulletin.
In the course of a hard-fought
defensive battle...
the heroic troops
of the Fatherland...
under the command
of General von Hartung...
succeeded in driving back
the Russian forces near Bezanika.
- Bezanika?
- Bezanika is a very strategic point...
of this sector.
We will now broadcast a message
from our Fuhrer.
Bezanika?
The Russians are there.
Only 400 kilometers away.
They're in Poland.
What are you doing here?
The sentry in the marketplace
said I should come to Your Royalness...
for my proper punishment.
Although I hadn't heard the siren,
and with due respect...
if his watch is right,
then your clock is wrong.
But that is for you to decide.
Decide?
What?
My appropriate punishment.
Even though, I take the liberty
of repeating myself--
It's not yet quite 8:00.
It still isn't 8:00.
It's only three minutes to 8:00.
No. Two minutes to 8:00.
Then the gentleman-- the sentry
was just making fun of me.
Just because a war is going on
doesn't mean...
people should stop playing jokes
on one another.
May I?
WeJews are partial
to jokes too.
- Do you live far from here?
- Ten minutes, if I run.
Then hurry.
Please, may I have a pass?
Now what do I do, Hannah?
I'm locked outside.
It's crazy, Hannah. I may be
the onlyJew for 400 kilometers...
trying to get back into the ghetto.
Hurry.
To get across that distance,
you have to be a mouse.
Oh, God of theJews...
why didn't you make your people
a race of mice?
I ask You quite frankly,
what good does it do to be a man?
I'm going. I go.
Not yet!
- Wait for the searchlight to go by.
- Who are you?
Lina Kronstein.
I'm ten and a half.
How old are you?
Watch out!
What are you doing here anyway?
Trying to escape?
Where? AJew would not last
five minutes out there.
- So you're going back in?
- Yes.
May I come with you?
With me?
- Why me?
- Who else?
All right.
Come on.
- Wait.
- Oh, you're scared?
No. Terrified.
Come on! This way!
- Here.
- Thank you, little mouse.
Hide! Police!
Here.
Bye-bye, little girl.
Thanks for saving my life.
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm very tired. I'm going home.
You should do the same.
Maybe I'll take the train.
Yeah, bye-bye.
All right.
Where would you like to go?
Do you have any money for your fare?
Come on. You can't stay here.
You have to go home.
Where are your parents?
Come on!
Our apartment is much nicer.
We have a living room.
Yeah, well, when there were
ten people crammed in here...
I'll show you no living room.
If you don't like it,
find another hotel.
That's not a nice thing
to say to me.
- Excuse me.
- Where do I sleep?
- Upstairs.
- Can't I sleep here?
Because if you do, some nosy neighbor
might see you and then denounce me.
Then the Germans will come.
Come on.
- Hey, kitty.
- Leave the cat alone.
- Don't you like cats?
- No. I'd prefer a rat.
I don't want to see you
playing with that cat.
And I certainly don't want to see you
try to catch it and eat it.
Any cat that lets itself get caught
is sick.
All right, but what am I
supposed to eat?
You don't have
any ration coupons for me.
That's true.
I'll burn that bridge
when I get to it.
Here we are.
Look, huh?
There's heat from the chimney.
Here. It's a book about Africa.
You read this, you forget you're hungry.
- Don't worry. I'm used to it.
- Yeah. Come on.
- What's wrong?
- I lost my doll.
- Sorry. I don't have any dolls.
- Why not?
Well, me and my wife
didn't have any children.
Where is your wife?
Did they put her on a train?
No, they shot her!
Under a tree.
Don't ask me what kind of tree.
I didn't bother to ask.
Time for sleep, hmm?
It's crazy, Hannah.
I manage to more or less
smuggle myself through the war.
I even got out of
the Kommandantur alive.
And now I'm supposed to take care
of a little girl.
Yeah, I know we wanted a child.
But you usually have them as babies,
and you get a chance to know them.
That's true.
But what if the Germans find her?
I'm the one who's going to have to pay.
If the Russians are that close...
it's only a few days, right?
Bezanika
Germans are dying each day
Russians are on their way
- Kowalsky!
- We're closed. We're closed.
- Time to open.
- Leave me alone. Go away.
- Damn it.
- What are you doing?
- You can't kill yourself.
- You got a reason why not?
I have a good one,
that's just between you and me.
You won't believe this. Yesterday
evening, something very funny happened.
Actually, not that funny.
You might not find it funny,
but that's where I caught this cold.
- Get to the point.
- What the point is, my friend...
yesterday, after curfew,
I was in the Kommandantur.
- Are you an informer?
- Are you out of your mind?
NoJew leaves the Kommandantur alive
unless he's an informer.
Don't tell me lies.
I'm desperate, not stupid.
Get out of here.
Please leave me alone.
Fine. Go ahead.
People will say Kowalsky
didn't keep his part of the bargain.
- What?
- I'm entitled to a shave and haircut.
In exchange, you're entitled to eat as
many pancakes as you want in my café.
You haven't made pancakes
for three years.
What can I do about that?
The Germans don't let any potatoes in.
- Doesn't stop your beard from growing.
- That's not my fault. A deal's a deal.
Good. Here. What are you complaining
about? You have a dull razor.
Would you sit down, please?
Barber with a dull razor's
like a blind moyel.
No insults. Sit down, please.
Here we go.
Here. Enough.
Good. Good. Enough.
Mischa. Mischa.
- Professor.
- No, thank you.
Excuse me.
My respects, Professor.
I'm afraid I caught a cold last night.
Do you have some medical advice?
You know my prescription. A fine cigar
and a brandy taken in Monte Carlo.
- Give me your hand.
- Thank you.
- You have a good night?
- Good night?
If three suicides balanced by one birth
is a good night, then yes.
Splendid, wonderful night.
Line up! Two at a time!
Pick a partner!
- Herschel, you need a partner.
- Yes, but not with a cough.
- Professor.
- Two weak men don't make a strong man.
I need help.
Mischa, you forgot me.
- I unload, you carry.
- What's in it for me?
Pleasure of my company.
- I have to eat.
- Do I have to feed you?
All right.
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.
Where are you?
Sneaking a cigarette? Is that it?
Oh, my God!
Are you meshuga?
It's forbidden to do that.
Forbidden? It could be us in here
one day. Shouldn't we do something?
You want my opinion? The best thing to
do is nothing. I don't want to be shot.
What way would you prefer to die?
Go away. Don't stand around here.
I can't let you do something stupid!
- Can you stop me?
- I'm your manager.
- You're not a very good one.
- You're not a very good boxer.
- You want to try me?
- We're not the same weight class.
Guard.
The guard is coming.
You'll make a good-looking corpse.
Maybe I'll take one of those bastards
with me.
No, don't!
The Russians are in Bezanika.
And I heard Hitler was applying
to be chief rabbi in Berlin.
- It's the truth.
- Let's go.
I heard it on the radio.
It's forbidden to talk.
Go to work.
What are you laughing at?
Forgive me, but...
I just heard good news.
Go, go!
You'll get shot.
- You have a radio?
- Who said that?
- You said that.
- No, I didn't.
- What have we been talking about?
- Shut up!
You sneaky bastard.
You had a radio all this time.
I can't believe it.
I don't have a radio. I just said that
to keep you from getting shot.
Nobody would tell you he has one
if he doesn't.
I hope you realize the penalty
for having a radio is death.
I was lying!
Lying? If you had the radio and
you didn't want anyone to find out...
the best way to make sure of that
would be to tell people you had one...
because no one who owned a radio
would be stupid enough to admit it...
and they'd leave you alone,
which means--
- What does it mean,Jakob?
- I don't know.
It means you've got a radio.
I don't have a radio.
I understand.
Go, go.
Don't worry,Jakob.
You can trust me.
I'll keep it under my hat.
You better,
because if you don't...
you better start the Kaddish now,
because I'm a dead man.
-Jakob?
- What?
- I'm going to start training again.
- Tell your new manager.
Hello, Ana. How are you?
Are you taking a trip somewhere?
I think it's too dangerous
for you if I stay...
so I should go with my parents
after all.
May I take your book?
You're not going anywhere
until you eat your supper.
- Aren't you eating?
- Eat. Always eat.
It's not good to stuff yourself
till bursting.
Mischa. Have you been
in another fight?
No, it's nothing.
I have very good news.
Good news? What good news?
Hello, Mrs. Frankfurter.
How are you today?
Mr. Frankfurter,
I have something to ask you.
I've already beaten you, Papa.
Until the last line has been spoken,
the curtain cannot come down.
Excuse me. Mr. Frankfurter.
You have something to ask me?
I am prepared to help you
with the overcrowding in this apartment.
Oh, before I forget,
for you.
Two rutabagas.
I know it's not much. It doesn't
seem a fair exchange for--
Mr. Frankfurter.
Mrs. Frankfurter.
I am here to ask
for the hand of your daughter.
Come with me for a minute.
You know where we are?
There are trains coming to take us away
and you're making matrimonial plans?
We have learned to live
without firewood, without potatoes...
without decent clothing,
without the sound of children...
but no one can live
without a future.
We have a future, Mr. Frankfurter.
The war's about to end.
Someday, but who'll be here
to see it?
We will. Our war is nearly over.
You can almost count the hours.
Don't do this to my family. Don't come
here and fill our heads with false hope!
Do you know where Bezanika is?
Do I know where Bezanika is?
I played King Lear there three times.
- ''As flies--''
- ''To wanton--''
''As flies to wanton boys are we to
the gods. They kill us for their sport.''
Then you know Bezanika is less
than 400 kilometers away.
-So what do I care?
-The glorious Red Army is there tonight.
- Probably even closer by now.
- Stalin tell you this news personally?
In absolute confidence,
just between you and me...
and Rosa and Mrs. Frankfurter...
and Avron and Judith and--
Hello.
Jakob Heym told me.
Oh,Jakob Heym,
the illustrious pancake vendor.
If he said it,
it must be true.
He's got a radio.
Please, don't tell anyone.
It could be dangerous for him.
And you never said anything about it.
You've been listening to a radio.
Don't worry. It doesn't have a plug.
I'm going to reduce it to splinters.
Close the door.
We couldn't just listen to it
for a moment?
Excuse me.
Tell me what happens when Gestapo finds
out the pancake vendor has a radio.
Answer-- they will search the ghetto.
What will they find?
This radio.
I can explain that I never listened
to it. They will shoot me anyway.
For an encore, they'll hang me in the
square right next to that idiot Heym.
Morning.
So, what's new?
Nothing much, you know.
Kvart's wife left him.
Under the circumstances,
seems a little pointless.
- That's too bad.
- You know, women. Since Adam.
You don't say.
-Anything to keep hair from falling out?
-How long have we been friends?
What does it have to do
with my hair falling out?
Do you have that green stuff
you used to rub on Stamtisch's head?
You come every morning for a free shave
and never said anything about a radio.
What radio?
I have as many radios as potatoes.
- Everybody knows that you got a radio.
- What do you mean, everybody knows?
Not everybody, but it's traveling
as fast as the news about Kvart's wife.
Really? So by the evening,
the Gestapo will know.
You still have that rope?
I may need it.
Mischa says the Russians killed
so many Germans...
they were able to drive the tanks
across the river on their bodies.
- Did Mischa say that?
- Yes, he did. Is this true?
Is it?
I was looking for you. I want you to be
the first to know I'm engaged to Rosa.
Mazel tov!
But what about our news?
I only told family and friends
and Frankfurter.
Schmuck! You told a barber!
A barber--
the biggest mouth in town.
Murderer.
I'm sorry,Jakob.
You want a partner?
Jakob, you need a partner?
- He is my partner.
- No! I work with Samuel.
I'm your partner,Jakob. Me.
Stop. I know bubkes.
So, how many kilometers
did they make today?
Get off my back.
Excuse me. Your friend Jakob,
did he tell you about the front line?
Well, he asked me not to say.
What?
Mischa, can he get the BBC?
BBC? Of course.
- Please, give me something.
- Go away.
Don't tell me you haven't
listened since yesterday.
Oh, yesterday! Yesterday,
there was a program of dance music.
Maybe after work,
I could teach you the tango.
Shit!
Listen.
There was a program
of music yesterday.
Russian music.
I'm telling you,
we'll never see the Russians.
We'll never see the Russians, huh?
So, what are those?
Mr. Frankfurter, the Russians.
They're going to bomb us.
This is the good news?
Germans.
They look like Germans to me.
According to your information, they
were retreating under Russian attack.
They're flying east and--
And use your brains a little.
If the Germans are headed in that
direction, which is where Bezanika is...
and the Russians are headed there also,
I think--
If the Russians are there, they're
not going to sit and have a picnic.
I wouldn't think so.
- For this bread, three rutabagas.
- Two turnips.
No, for two turnips,
half a bread.
Three-quarters because it's you.
Stay away from the train!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, please!
Roman, I heard voices
coming from those boxcars.
Are you crazy? Come on.
The show is over!
Back to your work.
I heard voices.
Pretend there are just
potatoes in there.
It's the latest German invention--
potatoes that talk.
It's human voices!
We've got to speak to them.
What can you say to the dead?
What's the matter with you? You're the
one who said the Russians would be here.
- You want to keep that to yourself?
- It's none of our business.
- What's wrong with you?
- Sit down.
They have the right to know.
- Eat.
- I don't want to eat.
Someone help me, please!
Do you hear me?
We have information.
The Russians are almost here.
They're at Bezanika.
We all saw the plane.
Yes, please believe me.
You don't understand.
We have a radio.
Roman! You want to get killed too?
You did this!
Did you have to shout from the rooftops
that the war is over?
Look where it got us!
Don't blame yourself.
If Herschel wanted to save the world,
that was his choice.
We need moreJews like Herschel.
At least he tried to give these people
some hope. He's a hero, like you.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a latke vendor.
A latke vendor with a radio.
Who just killed a friend.
If you hang yourself,
I'll kill you.
- Are you going to listen to London?
- No.
I can't take anymore.
You must tell me. The Russians--
No Russians, no radio,
no nothing!
- Understand?
- What do you mean?
I mean I don't have the slightest idea
where the Russians are.
I'm a liar. All right?
You'll burn them.
Let me do it.
I'm perfectly capable
of frying mushrooms.
- I ran a restaurant before the war.
- A restaurant?
A very quaint one.
We made latkes.
You know, potato pancakes.
And blintzes stuffed
with apricot jam.
And in the summer,
ice creams and fruit juices.
Did your wife work with you?
- Why are you always asking questions?
- Why do you never answer them?
- I already ate.
- Eat.
And after you've eaten,
you can do the washing up.
- I hate washing up.
- I did the cooking, didn't I?
When the war is over,
can I be a waitress?
- What about school?
- I'll go to school every morning.
And afterwards,
I'll serve customers.
You don't have to pay me.Just let me
eat as many pancakes as I want.
Just like Kowalsky.
Open the window.
Look, your friend the boxer.
- Are they fighting?
- No. Maybe later they're fighting.
Looks like Mischa thinks
the war is over.
He's trying to get her
to go up to his apartment.
Doesn't she want to go?
- Very much.
- Then why doesn't she go?
Well, you'll discover these things
when you're older.
When?
No more questions. Come on.
Spirit...
if the Russians have reached Pry...
knock twice.
Ask it something useful, like where
your daughter is this time of night.
- She's with Mischa.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
He's involved with this troublemaker
Heym. They'll drag Rosa into it.
On the other hand, if Rosa
doesn't sleep home, it's better.
If they arrest us,
she won't be here.
- Some consolation.
- Max!
The days are so difficult now. Let them
do what they want with their nights.
So? Did you listen to the radio?
Any progress at the front?
What's the news? Did the Russians
shoot down those planes?
Stop torturing me. The Germans
are already doing a fine job.
Samuel.
- Is it suicide?
- He didn't need to.
He just gave up and pulled
the blankets under his chin.
Stupid thing for Samuel to do
when the Russians are that close.
Because they are, aren't they?
- Yes, Professor.
- What?
The radio says they are.
So, Hannah, the truth can kill.
Samuel died because
I told him the truth.
And that crazy Herschel died
because he believed in news...
from a radio that doesn't exist.
So that's dangerous too.
Whatever I do, I'm wrong.
Hunger for hope may be worse
than hunger for food.
So, what's new?
I have to feed them something,
Hannah.
But what?
Elements of the 1 6th Army...
supported by flamethrowers
of the shock troops...
of the Leningrad Division...
are advancing with
mechanized armored units...
of Stalin's Soviet 6th Brigade...
in a easterly direction
under massive air cover.
Easterly?
Then they're headed the wrong way.
It's just a feint.
To throw the Germans off, right?
Exactly.
Why would they announce
that on the radio?
Strategy.
To make the Germans think
they're going to invade China.
- Remember, it's a world war.
- Exactly right.
For example, in Africa...
there are tribes of cannibals
who've never seen a white man.
- We don't want news about cannibals.
- Why not?
We want to know if the Russians
are finally going to get here.
Technically, they're retreating,
but strategically, they're advancing.
What does that mean?
Let me show you.
Here is the front line.
Here is Bezanika.
The Russians have that.
Here's Pry.
The Germans have that.
Here is the railroad junction
at Rudna.
That's what the Luftwaffe
were trying to protect yesterday.
Exactly right. And the Germans
don't want the Americans to take that.
So the Americans
are in the war too?
They didn't say they were there.
They have their own problems.
They're fighting on another front.
But for now, they're sending tanks.
Tanks? How many?
Not many. But enough.
And brand-new,
right off the boat from Chicago.
How could you tell
they were American?
You get to know the difference.
American tanks,
it's a different noise entirely.
- What kind of noise?
- Clean.
You can hear the horns.
- On the tank?
- No, the band. The jazz band.
They sent a jazz band
to cheer up their allies.
- Saxophone?
- Clarinets.
Sounds like Benny Goodman.
- Lady singers?
- Three of them.
- Andrew Sisters?
- Maybe their cousins. Sounds beautiful.
And all the time in the background
I could hear the Russian guns.
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard in my whole life.
You know, the jazz band,
the artillery, everything.
It seems liberation is near.
Jakob Heym may not be the messiah,
but he could be a prophet.
Prophets speak in the name of God.
All the pancake vendor has is a radio.
He's saying the same thing
Isaiah said--
'' People of Israel,
I will lead you out of bondage.''
''Out of bondage.''
If this is what we get from Isaiah...
I can't wait to find out the results
from the pancake vendor.
He must be stopped.
Yeah, it is crazy.
I know, Hannah.
But when I started
to make up those things...
I almost believed them.
I know.
The point is,
what am I going to invent tomorrow?
In my whole life, my greatest invention
was an apricot pancake.
A latke.
My crowning achievement.
Latkes and lies.
What are you doing here?
Look what I made for you.
I'm not hungry.
What do you mean,
you're not hungry?
This is turnip soup,
made from real turnips.
- It's delicious. Try it.
- No, thank you.
- You haven't eaten cat, have you?
- Of course not.
Then it's the mushrooms.
Those mushrooms were bad.
Don't worry.
It's better not to be hungry
than to be hungry, isn't it?
Sneaky bastard. He's got
the radio in the attic, Rosa.
He's trying to get to London.
I'm sure of it.
Are you going to marry
Jakob Heym or me?
Rosa, we're not the only two people
in the world.
Think about the resistance that's going
to get organized because of this radio.
Maybe I should have put up
a little more resistance.
Then you'd pay
more attention to me.
Do you want more attention?
Maybe.
Come on.
Let's try to get some sleep.
Napoleon always made sure he got
a good night's sleep...
before his big battles.
And he didn't do too badly.
Go, go! Get away, you bad cat!
Something is going on. I knew it.
I have to see where he's going.
- Mischa, it's curfew.
- I know.
What if the Russians attack and
I'm lying around here? Where's my hat?
- I love you. You know that.
- I love you too.
Look at this. Look here. Look.
Your Mischa leaves our daughter at home
so he can run around with this Jakob.
Something must be done
about this nonsense.
Mischa! You frightened me!
So, that snob Kirschbaum is in
on it too? Why, because he's a doctor?
Yeah, because he's a doctor.
Go. Leave me alone!
I know you think I'm stupid, but
I'm not stupid. I know what's going on.
You heard a message from London,
and now you're going to tell Kirschbaum.
You were hit in the head
too many times.
- Good evening.
- Professor doesn't see patients now.
I'm a personal friend
of the doctor.
Professional colleague
at the freight yard.
- Your name?
- My name is Jakob Heym.
TheJakob Heym?
- I imagined you much taller.
- So did I.
Come in.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
My diploma. Forty years ago.
More than forty years.
I always knew this diploma
would come in useful.
So, what can I do for you?
- I have a girl in my attic.
- I'm a doctor, not a confessor.
No, please.
She's only ten years old.
She escaped from one
of the transports.
I've been taking care of her. I'm doing
my best, but I think she's very sick.
Come.
- I'll show you my pharmacy.
- Thank you.
There's nothing there.
Here, look.
All I have.
The only medicine we could give her
is some of that good news of yours.
Like the American tanks.
I mean, even if the jazz band...
was a little too much.
Benny Goodman.
Don't you think so?
That's a wonderful medicine
you have,Jakob. Wonderful.
I admire what you're doing.
I really do.
So let's go and see
this little friend of yours.
Esther, my bag and my coat, please.
Pancakes.
Oh, my God!
Kowalsky!
You need an emergency shave?
The Russians will be here whether Heym
has a radio or not, won't they?
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
You and I are in
the same profession.
After all, who knows more about
human nature than actors and barbers?
You have your stage, I have mine.
Now I risk treading on yours
to make a solemn plea.
Tell your friend Jakob to destroy
the radio before it destroys us.
Destroy it? The radio?
Your friend Jakob
is preparing an uprising.
That's ridiculous. This isn't
the kind of ghetto that rises up.
Even to think of it is blasphemy.
Jews put their trust
in God to protect them.
Well, we have to admit that that line
of reasoning hasn't gotten us very far.
If you don't believe me
about the uprising, answer this--
What areJakob and the prizefighter
doing walking around after curfew?
- Mischa is in this?
- Up to his neck.
Stupid, stupid.
My God! Anybody could
see us here.
What do you think?
They don't have eyes?
Quiet!
Professor, it's really
very important to me.
It's not very far.
Right this way.
Could somebody please tell me
what's the point of this?
You see? What's he doing out
this time of night?
What are we doing out
at this time of night?
What's this?
When a man loses his fear of
the Almighty, he's capable of anything.
I hope to God not to find out
disgusting things about Heym.
What do you mean?
His private affairs are none of
our concern. Look for the radio.
Only a complete idiot
would hide a radio in the kitchen.
- Maybe try the cellar.
- Good idea.
- Yes, the cellar.
- Let's go. Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- This way, Professor.
- Oh, my God! He's here.
- Not so fast.
- Only one more floor, Professor.
Shut up!
Slow down.
I have a heart condition.
- I am exhausted.
- Right here.
Wait, wait, wait.
I need to rest.
I need to rest a little bit.
What if the Russians said that?
Yeah, you're right.
Kirschbaum is part of the resistance.
I would have bet money on it.
He keeps it in the attic.
Jakob, there are thieves
in your apartment.
My apartment?
What's to steal?
Now, come on. Lie down.
And you do everything
the professor says.
Let's see.
Stick out your tongue like a frog
trying to catch a fly and say ''Ah.''
All we have here
is a little tummy ache.
Too much ice cream.
Chocolate, maybe?
She is very sick.
Boiled water only.
And some of your medicine maybe.
It's in here.
If they are listening to the radio,
we could be considered accomplices.
- Oh, my God!
- We'd better wait for them there.
That's a very good point. I love
your point. Let's get out of here.
- What are you doing here?
- Hello.
My God, Kowalsky. You too?
I think it's really for the best.
- Mr. Heym.
- I really do.
I don't know if you realize the danger
in which we have been placed.
There are informers in the ghetto
who will do anything for a few potatoes.
Therefore, I beg you,
as a father and a husband...
please destroy that radio
before the Germans find out about it.
You want me to destroy my radio?
I do, yes.
All right.
I'll destroy it.
It's a dangerous thing.
- I admit that.
- Good.
Destroy the radio.
But since Mr. Heym has accepted
to share the information with us...
there has not been a single case
of suicide in the entire ghetto.
- This is true?
- It is true!
The professor has
a very good point.
- Very good point.
- Think about it.
It saves lives.
That's a very good reason
to keep it.
- I have a suggestion.
- What?
We could listen to the latest news,
and then destroy the radio.
Good idea.
My God! These idiots want to
defy You once again.
Stop them! I beg You.
- It's a power cut.
- It's a miracle.
Sorry, gentlemen.
No more radio. No more news.
Good night.
Thank you for coming.
No electricity.
Nothing.
It's sabotage.
It's sabotage of the resistance.
Stop! We go back.
We can't go back.
Thank you.
It's a miracle.
It's sabotage.
It's sabotage of the resistance.
- Miracle!
- Sabotage!
Miracle, miracle, miracle!
Shut up!
Here, here, drink.
Because you've got to get well...
because your parents are coming back.
And when they do, we're going to have
the biggest party you've ever seen.
I'll be back.
Jakob, is it true
you've got a radio?
Not you too?
Please. I've heard you have a radio.
I'd really like to see it.
I was a baby when
they took ours away.
If you promise me to get well...
I promise you,
you can listen to my radio...
if the power comes back on.
Do you mean it?
Would I lie to you?
- So, what's new?
- New?
Anybody would think you were
happy about the power cut.
God's will be done.
- I think that green stuff is working.
- Stamtisch never complained.
So? Yeah? Hello.
I know I'm not a member
of the club...
but I thought you might
want to hear my idea anyway.
- I don't.
- You see?
Mischa was thinking,
Mr. Heym...
if the electricity can't come
to your radio...
maybe you can take your radio
to the electricity.
- What are you talking about?
- Electricity.
You see?
Only certain streets are affected.
We could bring the radio here.
Bring the radio here?
It's a great idea. This is the best idea
I ever heard in my life.
What a wonderful idea.
Bring the radio here.
Absolutely. We put up a big sign,
in Polish and German...
so that everyone will know
there is a radio in my shop.
I could charge admission, with reduced
prices, of course, for the Gestapo.
Put up loudspeakers.
I could sell refreshments.
What about dances
in between news reports?
I could invite the Luftwaffe and give
them all shaves before they hang me.
It won't work,
because I know Jakob Heym...
and he won't give you
the dirt from under his fingernails--
begging your pardon,Jakob--
let alone lend you his precious radio.
You're saying I'm cheap.
What else do you call a man who's had
free shaves every day for four years...
without giving so much as
a sniff of a pancake in return?
I thought you were my friend.
Friends can say these things
about each other.
So, shall we go and fetch it?
What if the Germans
see us with it?
What if they damage it?
We could've put it in a child's coffin.
The Germans ignore dead children.
- Let's go.
- No. We can't.
- Why?
- It'll never work.
He'll never let you do it.
He'll says it costs him too much
in electricity.
- Now you're saying I'm cheap?
- You're not?
- I'm cheap?
- You are.
- Yes, you're cheap.
- You're cheaper.
Every day you're supposed to have
one pancake for one shave.
But you don't have one pancake,
you eat five! You stuff your face!
Bring the damn radio.
I'll show you how cheap I am.
- You're not that cheap.
- Now, that's a mensch.
That's not a mensch, that's meshugeneh.
Kowalsky, wait!
Wait. I didn't mean it.
You're not cheap.
Careful. Police.
What are you waiting for?
Go.
Can't do it.
Why not?
My nerves.
I'm a coward.
You get to know these things
about yourself.
Some people look inside, they find
things nobody ever knew were there.
LikeJakob.
Then there's the rest of us.
You can't force a man
to risk his life.
We'll keep it at my place. The power
will come back sooner or later.
By then the news will be even better.
Won't it,Jakob?
Like cheese.
Hey, Kowalsky!
You need a partner?
Take off your hats!
Hardtloff, the liquidator.
What's he doing here?
What do you think?
Looks like it's time
to pack our bags.
What does our prophet
have to say about this?
What's the prognosis, Doctor?
Supraventricular tachycardia.
Could be.
- Good. Sounds serious.
- It is serious.
How long can you live with that?
How long can we live with him?
That's the question.
Feeling better.
Tonight is Shabbat.
Great.
We'll fast
like every other night.
You're not a very good Jew,
are you?
Hannah used to light the candles.
Don't you believe?
I believe we are
the chosen people...
but I wish the Almighty
had chosen somebody else.
But you're still a Jew,
aren't you?
In the eyes of the Gestapo...
I'm the biggest yid
they've ever seen.
The lights.
No miracles
for part-timeJews, huh?
You remember what you promised,
don't you?
I remember.
I got better since then.
And now you want to listen
to the radio.
- Well, you can't.
- Why?
- I got rid of it.
- Why?
- I gave it to Mischa.
- Why?
''Why? Why?'' Always ''Why?''
He was driving me crazy.
- Gestapo! Open the door!
- Under the bed.
I don't think it's very clever
hiding under a bed.
This is not a discussion.
- Hello.
- You.
If the German electricians only knew
the trouble they were going through...
just to get
your radio working again.
It's funny, isn't it?
May you die laughing.
What do you want?
I want to listen
to the radio.
I have to know what's taking so long.
I have to make my wedding plans.
- It's quite impossible.
- Why is it impossible?
''Why? Why?''
Everybody's ''Why?''
Yes, why?
It's not even your radio anymore.
It belongs to everyone now.
You're waiting for someone?
- Who is it? You can tell me.
- Then you'll tell everyone else.
Soon the Gestapo's
knocking on the door for real.
You're hiding someone, huh?
Yes.
Why couldn't you
think this quick in the ring?
- Someone important?
- Very important.
I'll tell you all about it tomorrow,
but right now we need our privacy.
Yes, yes.
To think that,
of all people...
my old manager,Jakob Heym--
Schmuck.
Mischa needs the radio.
All right. I lied.
I lied...
because it's a sin to listen
to a radio on Shabbat.
But you don't observe Shabbat.
Where does this lead?
The radio.
But you must do everything I say.
- Promise?
- Promise.
- So, this is your restaurant?
- It was.
More of a café, but--
You sit here, huh?
All right?
Don't move.
If you move, the radio won't work.
I'm going to go turn it on
and we both are going to listen to it.
But if I see you get up,
the radio goes right off.
All right, now I turn it on.
There. It takes a few moments
for the tubes to heat up.
Once they're warmed up,
you'll hear talking.
It's heating up now.
We don't want him.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
This is the BBC in London.
Tonight we have
a special guest...
the Prime Minister
of Greater Britain...
the very honorable
Winston Churchill...
who is just now
coming into the studio...
putting out his cigar.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen...
and everybody in Poland.
- He likes the Polish, doesn't he?
- Of course.
We're his allies.
Mr. Churchill, if we only have
a little bit of time...
I would like you to bring us up to date
on the events around Bezanika.
I'd be delighted.
That is my area of exper--
Gesundheit, Mr. Churchill.
Excuse me.
The cigar smoke
gets up one's nose.
Where was I?
Bezanika, in Poland.
I know where Bezanika is.
I'm not stupid.
I was on the phone
with Mr. Stalin...
who told me his troops
were doing wonderfully.
Is that not so, Mr. Stalin?
Does that mean
it's nearly over?
That's a very good question.
He heard me!
We remind our listeners
not to ask questions...
as that might interfere
with the reception.
Please,
don't look at the radio!
But that's still
a very good question.
And the answer is...
yes!
The whole megillah
will soon be over...
and that schmendrick Hitler
will be gone.
That brings to an end
our special bulletin for Poland.
We remind our young listeners to
brush their teeth before going to bed.
- I turn it off now, huh?
- What about music?
Music.
Turn around.
Music.
Now, in memory of peacetime...
which will soon
be with us again...
a little dance music.
From the Grand Ballroom in London...
our evening concert.
May I have this dance,
mademoiselle?
Do you know how to polka?
I'll teach you.
Stand on my feet.
There you go.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
What's the latest?
- He's not up yet.
- What?
Good morning.
I have some good news.
I saw him yesterday.
He's hiding a parachutist
from London.
A parachutist?
Now they have parachutists.
How do I beat that?
Flying tanks?
They need news,
but I have no new ideas.
What can I invent now, Hannah?
Submarines?
The latest.
Ask anybody else.
I'm the only one in this whole ghetto
who's got no news, Hannah.
You going to work today,
or is this a one-man strike?
Come on.
- Come on.Jakob, what are you doing?
- I have to go.
Dysentery.
Jakob,
are you out of your mind?
You're gonna commit suicide.
That's a German toilet.
Can't wait.
You're gonna get shot,
you crazy bastard.
'' Massive traffic in Munich.''
'' Miracle cure for hemorrhoids.''
Shit!
''Sunny with occasional showers
in Berlin.''
'' Heidi, I miss you.
Franz.''
'' Loyal son of the Fatherland.''
'' Dear Nazis.'' Good news, bad news.
'' News.''
''The Luftwaffe reserves
beat the Kriegsmarine three-two...
in a hard-fought but fair game.''
Thank you.
TheJews will rejoice
at this news.
I'm sorry.
God, a miracle, please.
All right.
Your father
Cleans up after horses
Listen to me closely
I'll explain, oy vey
Your mama sleeps nights in the park
Hello! Hello!
Your father's doing time in prison
Your sister sleeps with a chazzer
Oy, vey
No! Stop! Please!
Are you out of your mind?
Are you all right?
What does it matter now that you,Jakob
Heym, the illustrious pancake vendor...
got to crap like a king?
So, now that you've shared
a toilet seat with the master race...
maybe you'll feel good enough
to tell us the news, huh?
Yesterday...
Churchill addressed
the Polish people.
- In Polish?
- You want the latest news or don't you?
Our apologies.
The main item...
was that
the Luftwaffe soccer team...
beat the Kriegsmarine
by three goals to two.
That's it?
You want the latest news?
That's it.
Churchill is on the BBC giving out
German army sports results?
Nothing about the front line?
I mean, if Churchill...
has nothing more important
to announce...
it means to me
the war is pretty much over.
That's right.
What if''three to two''
is a code?
Could mean the Russians
outnumber the Germans three to two.
Or maybe they're
3 2 kilometers away.
I don't think so.
I think that means that maybe
they are 3 2 hours away.
If we listen hard enough,
maybe we can hear their artillery.
Yes! That's what
the noise was last night.
My wife thought
it was the heating pipes...
but there hasn't been
any steam in them for years.
- I heard it too.
- Oh, you heard it too.
Yes, I heard it too.
I think it's time to organize.
Professor, did you hear this Avron?
He plans to organize.
Well, maybe he's right.
Maybe we can save a few lives
if we have an organization and a leader.
For all we know, the Russians may be
pushed all the way back to Siberia.
Yeah, but Hardtloff is here.
You know what that means.
What, you're going to
fight the Germans barehanded?
What do you suggest we do...
just sit down and wait?
Hope is all very well, but sometimes
it takes a little action too.
You should understand this.
It's going to be a massacre...
all because theseJews
believe the dreck I feed them.
But you started this...
and now you have to go on.
Let's only hope
that your lies were true.
Let's hope that.
What is it?
You know what it is.
Forgive me,
butJakob, he's right.
And I am wrong?
And you are wrong.
Oh, you smelled the cooking,
Mr. Frankfurter. Come in.
- Mr. Frankfurter.
- Papa!
I'm happy you still remember.
How's Mama?
You know how mothers are.
She hasn't seen you in a few days, so--
So I said to myself, today is Sunday,
I'm going so see our only daughter...
and bring her her things.
That way, if they come to take us away,
she'll still have her trousseau.
It's beautiful.
- Yes, but is it what we need right now?
- I know what you need right now.
I once played Sherlock Holmes, and
I always insisted on authentic props.
Young man, I realized
I care about more people...
than my immediate family.
In other words, perhaps I'm wrong
and your friend Jakob is right.
And while I'm baring my soul
I must tell you that...
I did not play King Lear
three times.
I played it once,
and I forgot half my lines.
Try not to get killed
before you marry my daughter.
And remember, until the last line
has been spoken--
The curtain cannot come down.
Well, gentlemen,
I think the person we need...
has to have physical...
as well as moral courage.
He has to be a man who has proved
that he is willing to take risks.
I think he should also be a man...
who has brought hope--
hope and dignity...
to the ghetto.
Thank you, Esther.
Sounds like the professor
to me.
We will see.
''Jakob Heym.''
You see? ''Jakob Heym.''
Blumenthal?
- '' Professor Kirschbaum.''
- You see?
Congratulations.
A little apricot liqueur.
I was saving it
for a special occasion.
Gentlemen.
Jakob Heym. To victory.
I get the door.
Gestapo!
Open the door!
Why are you running?
It's Mischa.
Good joke.
Very good joke.
I know, I know.
I'm not invited.
But I have something...
I think you will find
interesting.
Where did you get that?
You have a radio,
I have a gun.
German steel.
At least we can count on them
for something.
So, now that you're the leader,
what's our next move,Jakob?
We have to wait for the signal.
- The signal?
- Yes.
Then we start the insurrection.
- The BBC said so.
- What's the signal?
Something very special, like,
''The chicken is in the pot''...
or ''The baby is singing.''
But our signal is top secret.
I'm not at liberty to tell at this time.
Further evidence that you are
in the best position to lead us,Jakob.
But if I'm your leader...
I will only do it
on one condition:
you must be disciplined.
All of you.
Now, we only have a little time left.
Right, Professor?
And in that time...
if anybody does anything stupid...
you have to answer to me.
Open up! Gestapo!
That's not Mischa.
Open the door!
- Yes?
- Open the door!
Does theJew Kirschbaum
live here?
Professor Kirschbaum lives here.
- Do you have an appointment?
- We don't need one.
- Tell the Professor this is urgent.
- Wait here.
I shall tell him you are here.
Come in.
Take a seat, please.
We have some visitors.
Andre, dear.
Some gentlemen to see you.
Good luck,Jakob.
Shalom.
There's only two of them.
Give me the gun.
- No.
- It's my gun.
I am the leader.
Gentlemen.
- What can I do for you?
- Please get your bags.
General Hardtloff
has suffered a heart seizure.
That's the first good news
I ever got from a German.
Hardtloff.
He's not my patient.
I presume he has his own doctor.
Are you refusing?
- No, I'm--
- I'll get your bag.
Thank you, Esther.
I put in the other pills.
The ones for your heartburn.
With a little luck...
you will not need them.
Unfortunately,
I think I will.
Thank you...
Esther.
He'll be back.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Oh, it's a very nice place.
- Come on! Go!
- Meyer!
Sorry. Idiot.
It's a great honor to meet you.
I attended all your lectures in Berlin.
Berlin.
The good old days, yes.
Please, over here.
It seems this little town...
is home to one of the greatest
cardiologists in the world.
Yes, I had the honor
of teaching in Berlin...
and now I'm a professor
of latrine cleaning...
in the freight yard here.
I see.
The ghetto is going to be
emptied tomorrow.
I can see to it...
you are not on the transport.
Why so generous?
I'm surrounded by incompetence.
These doctors are unable
to do anything for me...
and the pain is unbearable.
Open the jacket, please.
Let me see.
I know this sound.
I have a similar condition.
It's pretty painful, isn't it?
Yes.
But I have a little problem.
On the one hand, as a physician,
I am obliged to help you.
On the other hand,
if I save your life...
you'll liquidate the ghetto.
And if you do not...
my men will liquidate you.
This is the radio of
the German Armed Forces Network.
Heil Hitler!
We will now broadcast
a special bulletin.
Our troops are engaged
in the battle of Normandy.
News.
Sorry. Perhaps you would like
to hear how the war is going.
But, of course, you have
your own sources of information...
your own radio.
In the ghetto? That's--
You think we are stupid?
We have informers.
I know you listen to the BBC,
that you are dreaming about resistance.
Why don't you give me the name
of the criminal who owns the radio?
I'll save you.
What do you say?
It's a hard decision to make, yes.
It's a hard decision.
May I have a glass of water,
please?
If it helps you to make up your mind,
why not?
Water.
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir, but I...
Poison.
It was poison!
You bastard yid!
I forbid you to die!
You really shouldn't get excited.
Take my advice.
You know, I am
a world-famous cardiologist, yes.
''World-famous cardiologist.''
I'm a...
a world-famous cardiologist.
Esther.
Professor! Professor!
- Stop it. He's dead.
- Rise.
You let this dirty yid
defy me.
But, Herr General--
I want to see this radio here
tomorrow morning!
Go!
Heil Hitler.
Halt!
A criminal terrorist
is hiding a radio in the ghetto...
in defiance of regulations.
Unless the man responsible
brings himself and the accomplices...
to the Kommandantur by midnight...
ten hostages
will be shot in reprisal.
A criminal terrorist

Hello?
Are you there?
- What do you want?
- Is that any way to greet a visitor?
Sorry. Should I go to the basement,
fetch a bottle of champagne?
No wonder you never
had any customers.
I wanted to tell you
about that green stuff.
Never worked...
for Stamtisch...
didn't work for me,
and it won't work for you.
The last cigarette
before you tell me to turn myself in.
No, that's between you and Him
up there...
if He is up there.
No, actually, I wanted
to ask you about the signal.
But I was wondering if--
That signal
must have come by now...
I think, or...
any minute now.
What do you think? Huh?
What?
For what I'm about to say,
I'd rather be in the dark.
I don't have a radio.
I've never had one.
And if I did, I wouldn't have had
the guts to listen to it.
So how did you know
where the Russians were?
- I made it up.
- No.
I don't think
you could make that up.
The battle for Rudna,
the tanks, the Luftwaffe, Churchill--
- The jazz band, all of that.
- I don't think so.
Actually,
the soccer score was genuine...
thanks to your dancing
that day.
And Bezanika, I really did
hear that in the Kommandantur.
But as for the rest of it...
it's lies.
All lies.
Sometimes I amazed myself.
But it's lies.
And wishful thinking.
- You're telling the truth?
- Finally.
Go ahead.
Tell me how much you hate me.
So that-- that was--
Our dear friends, the Germans,
and half the German army...
they were tearing
the ghetto apart for...
for a radio
that doesn't even exist?
Don't tell Mischa.
It'll kill him.
You are not sleeping.
You shouldn't ruin your eyes
like that.
I'm not going to see
my parents again, am I?
The Russians aren't coming,
are they?
Yes, they are.
A whole battalion of them
straight from Moscow...
with tanks and a big band.
Is that another lie?
Why should I believe you?
Would I lie about
something like that?
Yes.
I heard you
talking to your friend.
But I understand why you did it.
You wanted to be...
good.
That's from Hannah.
She told me she wishes
we had a little girl like you.
Where are you going?
I have something I have to do.
Get some sleep.
- Why?
- Well--
Questions.
Always questions.
- I have to give the Germans my radio.
- But you don't have a radio.
That's a problem, isn't it?
Maybe I'll go and explain it all
to my good friend in the Gestapo.
He'll see the funny side of it
and we'll have a good laugh about it.
That one's from me, maidelah.
Be careful.
Mischa, open the door.
It's me,Jakob.
- Has the signal come?
- Not yet. But I need your services.
- Are we going to rescue the hostages?
- That's being taken care of.
Your mission
is to go to my attic.
- I'll get my clothes.
- No. Not now. Tomorrow.
If I don't show up at work, go to
my place, under cover of darkness...
and transfer back here something special
I left for you to take care of.
- The radio.
- Something special.
- I understand.
- Good.
Where is my gun?
This mission
does not require a gun.
It requires a good brain
and a strong heart.
So I chose you,
our best man.
Good-bye, my friend.
DearJakob...
You'll probably hold yourself
responsible for my death...
and if you look at it
one way...
you'd be right.
But when you look at it
a different way...
your imaginary radio gave me
a reason to keep going...
for a few more days, anyway.
And much as I'd like to...
I don't hold anything
against you.
With a bit of luck,you'll find some
other schmuck to shave you for free.
Until I see you again...
I remain your best customer...
Kowalsky.
Remember me?
The smartJew?
Why are you out after curfew?
It's about my radio.
I must see the officer on duty.
I wish to give myself up.
Maybe you are not such a smartJew.
Keep going.
I know the way.
It's in here.
So, here we have
the famous Jakob.
Did you bring your radio?
Yes and no.
Papa!
Please! Please! Please!
Halt!
Here, Mischa. Come here.
Come on, come on.
- You're going to get us killed.
- I have to go toJakob's.
Rosa, go. Go! Go!
The radio?
The hostages.
Nothing yet?
Another few moments.
All right. Continue.
Tell us about the radio...
I will see what I can do
for the hostages.
- Look by the window.
- There's nothing here.
It has to be here somewhere.
I hear something.
- I'm sorry if I frightened you.
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
I'm Lina Kronstein. I live here.
But it's a secret.
You are Mischa, aren't you? Jakob said
you would come and take care of me.
Take care of you?
We'll be happy to.
Won't we, Mischa?
Listen very carefully.
This is very important.
- Do you know whereJakob hid the radio?
- Of course I do.
- You do?
- I've heard it.
- ''This is the BBC from London.''
- You actually heard this radio?
- But I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
- Where is it?
Where is your damn radio?
Lina, where the radio is
matters a great deal to a lot of people.
Do you thinkJakob
would trust us to listen to it?
Stop.
I'll show you.
I'll show you my radio.
Go, Lina, go!
Forget about the radio, Mischa.
There...
is my radio.
You've just told
your last joke, yid.
Stop.
No. Go. Run.
Run. Trust me! Run!
Don't shoot.
Please don't shoot!
It was you...
theJew who was out
after curfew.
And it was your radio I heard.
Excuse me, sir.
Is that a problem for you?
You're the one with the problem,
my friend.
That's true.
That's certainly the case.
I can't argue with that.
But to let a Jew hear a radio,
that's a serious offense, isn't it?
You can shoot me,
but you still don't have my radio.
So...
we both have a problem,
don't we?
May I?
You will stand up
in front of theJews...
and tell them
there was no radio.
You made it all up, everything.
There is no radio,
no resistance.
In return for your confession,
I won't shoot you.
But you will put me
on a transport to the camps.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
That's not much of a deal for me.
You may be a good soldier...
but you're not
much of a businessman.
Excuse me for saying so.
Who knows?
You might survive a week
in the camps...
two weeks, six months...
until the Russians or the Americans
or the British arrive.
You know how close they are,
don't you?
There's always hope...
isn't there?
What man doesn't want to see
the next day...
and the one after that?
Good.
You all know this man.
He told you he had a radio.
He told you
that you should resist...
the German authorities.
He will now tell you...
that this was all a lie.
He will tell you that
there never was such a radio...
and that resistance...
is pointless.
Tell them.
Tell them.
You.
Tell them.
Jakob!
So that's how it ended.
I never got a chance to be the big hero
and make my big speech.
I swear, I had a speech all prepared
about freedom and never giving in...
but somehow...
yes, that's how it ended.
And they all
went off to the camps...
and were never seen again.
But maybe
it wasn't like that at all.
Because,you know,
as Frankfurter says...
''Until the last line has been spoken,
the curtain cannot come down. ''
Mischa.
About 50 kilometers out of town...
the train was stopped
by Russian troops...
who had just taken
Bezanika and Pry.
Roll it out, roll it out
Roll out the barrel
Sing a song of good cheer
'Cause the whole gang is here
Roll it out, roll it out
Let's do the Beer Barrel
Polka
