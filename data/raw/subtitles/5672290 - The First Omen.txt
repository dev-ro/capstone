Hmm.
Okay, cool.
Mmm.
Hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Uncle Malage.
Oh.
Wow. Okay.
Hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh.
It's bullshit.
It's bullshit. It's just
bullshit. They're just...
They're just trying
to scare me, all right?
They're trying to find
a religious explanation.
It's... It's nothing.
It's just bullshit.
Don't worry. It's nothing.
Huh?
Hmm?
Paco.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Uh...
Aye! Aye! Aye!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Um...
Hmm?
Oh...
Um...
Ah...
Mmm?
Uh-huh.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Ah.
Hmm?
Koffi...
Aye, aye, aye. Oh...
- Aye, ah, huh?
- Hmm.
Hey...
Damn!
My pussy hurts so bad.
What?
Is it that time of the month?
No, not even...
It's this burning
feeling, you know.
It's been two weeks now
but getting worse and worse.
How about you? How's the roads?
I think I'm gonna
sleep at the next stop.
Dead, dead tired.
But I think I should
be there by tomorrow.
That's if I don't
get any problems
at the customs in Zambia.
You know how it is.
You'll be okay.
Okay, love.
You tell me if
there's any problem?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Take care.
- Love you, bye.
- Love you.
Wow.
Wow.
Hmm?
My love, we must dissociate
appearances and the essence of the mind.
The mind is the creator
of happiness and suffering.
It is the creator of Nirvana
and negative emotions.
Ezra is an obstacle
to an infinite cycle.
I meditate to
control this emotion,
to transform my
resentment into karma of joy.
- - We will be
the antidote to this infection.
This mental poison that
lies within your organs,
within my organs,
results from our greed.
Mental poison of our
interrupted pleasure.
- - I don't have
the flu, I get the flu,
and it will fade
away like white gel
in the light of healthy karma.
- My love, call me
when you arrive -
so that we can
regenerate together.
What's the point
of getting tested
if you don't do all the STDs?
You slept again with
Malaika, didn't you?
She gave you something.
Ezra, you did. I
saw it. I know it.
I'm going to call her.
Hey, listen, you can go ahead
and fuck whoever you want.
But not with her.
Huh?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm.
No way.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Fuckboy is here to take you
to live your best
life in Durban.
So what?
We couldn't wait
till we get to Durban
and see a real doctor?
So, now you're going to tell me
how your real doctors
treat this shit, huh?
I wouldn't be in this mess if
you hadn't fucked with Malaika.
How could I have known?
You know she
doesn't protect herself.
All your fancy speeches...
of "Domination should change
first in the bedroom", don't work.
What the fuck?
What does this all mean?
Palm oil doesn't cure shit.
I know. Sorry.
Okay.
