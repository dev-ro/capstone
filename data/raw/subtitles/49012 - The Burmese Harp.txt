THE SOIL OF BURMA IS RED,
AND SO ARE ITS ROCKS...
The war ended long ago,
but it left indelibly
sad stories in our hearts.
What follows is one such story
that happened to our company.
It's a story
we shall never forget.
By July of 1945,
the tides of war had turned
against Japan even in Burma.
Our company retreated
from one mountain to the next.
We wanted to reach
the border somehow
and cross over into Thailand.
Why don't we sing?
Singing is meant
for times like these.
Mizushima...
play your harp.
A night in late autumn
The solitary traveler
Looks up at the sky
With a desolate heart
His beloved hometown
His parents dear
The path of his dreams
Is one that leads back home
We often sang.
Our captain had graduated
from music school
and eagerly taught us
the basics of choral singing.
Those songs lifted our spirits
in times of sorrow and pain.
In our company,
we had a special harp
fashioned after one used in Burma.
PFC Mizushima
learned how to play it.
He'd never studied music,
but he had a natural gift
and quickly mastered it.
He composed wonderful
accompaniments and variations
and played along as we sang.
- Kobayashi, watch these.
- All right.
PFC Mizushima reporting.
I'm leaving now to scout ahead.
- Thanks.
- I'll signal on the harp, as usual.
I'll play “Danger” if I see anything,
“All Clear” if it's okay to advance.
You look better like that
than in uniform.
He looks Burmese.
You should settle down here.
The natives would love you.
Me Burmese.
Burma nice country.
What's taking him so long?
Shall we send out
a second scout?
- The harp!
- Mizushima's playing the harp.
Which tune is it?
You still can't tell?
It's the “All Clear.”
I always confuse them.
Sarge has a tin ear, huh?
Move out!
- What happened?
- Did a fox cast a spell on you?
- Some thieves cornered me.
- Thieves?
What did they take?
What could they take?
All he had on was a longyi.
- They took my longyi!
- And wrapped you in banana leaves?
They gave me these.
They had quite a few.
They held me up and asked me to
exchange the longyi for banana leaves.
What a polite holdup!
You look even better
in those leaves.
With a gold collar,
you'd look just like a cannibal.
A banana waist cloth
keeps you cool.
Our greatest worry was food.
Enemy paratroopers
had laid traps in the villages,
so we couldn't afford
to be careless.
Where's the village chief?
Through distant clouds
the snows of the Himalayas glisten
We bathe ourselves
in its melted waters
Somewhere afar
your hidden spirit
Soothes with those waters
this burning heart
Can you see the Himalayas?
Not from here.
The sutras and tradition tell us
that the Himalayas
are the home of the soul.
We long to see them,
even if just once.
Your playing has gotten
very good recently.
Not at all.
You should just settle here and play.
You've always said you love Burma.
I want to go home to Japan.
Japan...
Your hospitality was quite unexpected.
We thank you.
We'll sing a song of gratitude.
“Setting Sail,” first verse.
I knew it was
too good to be true.
- Stay put!
- The ammo boxes!
Nobody move.
Is it the British?
Sing! They're forming
a line in the woods.
We'll make them think
we don't know they're there.
Get ready for action
as we sing.
Blossoms fall in my jade cup
The moon is reflected
in my sweet wine
Lost in thoughts
of peace and order
I look down
on the fields of glory
Rising toward the far hill
Five stalwart youths
in high spirits
Clap your hands!
Laugh!
They could attack
at any moment.
Night's falling.
We need to keep them off guard.
Laugh and clap your hands!
What about the ammo boxes?
One shot
and they'll all explode.
One shot and we'll be
blown to pieces.
O merciful Buddha...
False alarm.
They're not the enemy.
Wait!
Listen.
The song's in English.
That night, we learned that the war
had ended three days earlier.
We gave up our arms.
We have surrendered.
Not only us,
but our country as well.
I'm not sure
what to make of this.
We don't know where we'll be taken,
what we'll have to do,
or even if we'll be
allowed to live.
All of Japan has been
heavily bombed.
Many are dead.
Many are homeless and starving.
Our country is in ruins,
while we're imprisoned
thousands of miles away.
All we can do now
is watch and wait.
It's no use fighting our fate.
Far better to accept it like men
and wait for the day
when we can rise again as a nation.
Up until now,
we've lived and died together.
Now we must
share this fate together too.
If we die here in Burma,
we'll die together.
But if by chance
we're able to return home,
we'll do so together,
leaving no man behind.
We'll rebuild our country.
That's all I can say for now.
What's Mudon like?
So we're finally going
to the Mudon prison camp.
- Good thing, too!
- What's so good about it?
You think they'll kill us all?
Are you serious?
So what's Mudon like?
How should I know?
- Where's Mizushima?
- Here.
The captain's calling you.
A Japanese unit has been
holding out on a mountain.
The British have laid siege to it
for the past three days.
I've asked them
to let one of us go
and talk our men
into surrendering.
I don't want a single man
to die needlessly.
That's the mountain there.
What do you say?
Will you go?
It's a half day's trek by foot.
I'll go, sir.
I'm not sure what to do,
but I’ll proceed as necessary.
Thank you.
The rest of us
will go south to Mudon.
Join us once you've completed
your mission.
It’ll be tough to walk
the 200 miles to Mudon alone,
but the British
have assured you safe passage.
I’ll proceed to Mudon
once I've fulfilled my duty.
Very well. Persuade them to surrender.
But you only have 30 minutes.
We won't wait any longer.
What happened?
They suddenly stopped.
Must be having
their afternoon tea.
- Son of a bitch!
- Wait! He's Japanese!
- Careful!
- How'd you get here?
- Well done!
- Where'd you come from?
Where's your commander?
Hey, what's this?
We can use every man
we can get at a time like this!
Stand at attention!
I'm Mizushima from Inouye Company.
I'm here on a mission.
What? You're a messenger?
The Japanese army
has surrendered.
Further resistance is useless.
Please surrender as quickly as —
Shut up!
How dare you!
Surrendering is an insult
to those who've died!
Unlike your unit,
we're not filthy cowards!
We’ll fight to the death!
- What good are you then?
Live, endure, work
for your country!
For our country?
How dare you!
How does surrendering
help our country?
No one here wants to live
with that humiliation!
As long as nobody surrenders,
how can Japan lose?
That's right!
A coward like you
can't be Japanese.
Leave!
- I refuse!
Not until you reconsider.
You’ll die if you stay.
Aren't you afraid?
I don't want to die
meaninglessly.
Dying in battle
is meaningless?
It doesn't serve Japan
or its people or yourself.
It's meaningless.
- How dare you!
- A harp? What's the big idea?
- I use it to signal.
Captain, you're responsible
for these men's lives.
If they die in vain,
the blame will be yours.
Who will apologize to their families
and to the people of Japan?
Very well.
I’ll ask the men.
- Nakai, what about you?
- I’ll fight to the end, sir.
And the rest of you?
How's it really gonna turn out?
Just as I said.
If only we had time
to discuss it calmly.
Unfortunately, time's almost up.
Please decide
in the next three minutes!
It's unanimous:
We’ll fight to the death!
I’ll ask the British
to give me more time.
- You're afraid of dying!
- Coward!
- I'm not a coward!
- Should we be taken prisoner?
Go home alone!
Very well.
I don't have time
to argue with you.
What are you doing?
We’ll never surrender!
My captain said not to let
a single man die needlessly!
You’ll pay for this,
you son of a bitch!
MUDON
It's awful quiet.
Old lady, glad you made it!
And in the rain!
It's her livelihood.
Old lady, let's trade.
What do you have today?
That stupid Indian soldier.
Firing blanks to scare me.
A raw recruit, I’ll bet.
How can he not know my face?
How about a molasses bar
for this broom?
That's a broom?
I made it out of palm leaves.
You're a clever fellow.
Okay, it's a trade.
I made
this bamboo flute yesterday.
It sounds really nice.
Trade for some bananas?
Okay, trade.
I don't want this monkey you gave me.
Can I trade it for food?
No, that's a naughty monkey.
I won't take it back.
I’ll trade these new socks
for shrimp paste.
Okay, trade.
- Is that stuff good?
- Tastes like our salted fish guts.
Old lady...
did you ask about
what we discussed?
You forgot again, didn't you?
It's hopeless.
We can't get information.
We have to rely on you.
It's no use getting angry.
Please don't forget this time.
The wounded Japanese
brought to the Mudon hospital —
were they really captured
on Triangle Mountain?
And if so, was there
a man from another unit?
And is he okay?
Just ask that much.
I'm going to the hospital
in a few days for some trading.
I’ll ask about it.
- We’ll pay what we can.
- Don't forget.
Don't forget, please!
I understand.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
She's kind,
but completely unreliable.
I wonder what happened to him.
It's been over ten days.
I should have gone myself.
- Don't feed the monkey now.
- It's hungry.
That's the rice I saved.
I was going to feed it tomorrow.
What? Yesterday
you gave it my share!
- Go to sleep!
- I smell sake.
Would you all shut up?
We haven't even begun to taste
the suffering of defeat yet.
We ought to be grateful
that we're just locked up here.
What do you say?
Let's start
our rehearsals tomorrow.
The shrike sings
on a withered branch
While we beat the straw
Okada, take this.
It's all as it was last year
But something is missing
The chop, chop, chop
of my brother's ax
- They're singing with us.
- They come every day.
Sarge, you don't
sing so well, do you?
I'm probably
the worst in the unit.
- So you know you're bad?
- I guess.
That monk's here again.
People always give him offerings.
He rakes it in here.
Fall in!
Double file, forward!
- What is it?
- What's wrong?
- Kinda looks like Mizushima.
- Looks exactly like him!
Mizushima?
Mizushima!
Stop fooling around.
You’ll scare him.
Taking shelter from the rain?
Hello, old lady!
What are you doing here?
This is my house.
So this is where you live!
Did you ask for us?
Yes, this time
I remembered to ask.
What happened to Mizushima?
Mizushima?
I mean,
what did they tell you?
Calm down and I’ll tell you
everything they told me.
You know the hospital,
the soldier —
Just give us the gist.
This squall's going to pass.
They said they were
on Triangle Mountain.
There was a man
from another unit.
They were all running around,
bullets flying everywhere,
so he probably died there.
So he's dead after all.
He died in battle.
That's the same kind
that monk had.
Did you meet the monk too?
This is the brother
of the monk's bird.
My husband spent
all day yesterday in the woods
and caught five parrots.
The monk came along
and asked him for directions.
My husband gave him a parrot
to earn a favorable rebirth.
He sold three.
Only this one is left.
Old lady...
will you sell me that bird?
It's a very cute bird.
This is thanks
for all the information.
This is for you too.
Thank you.
Go ahead. Take the bird.
This bird can learn
Burmese, Japanese —
anything you want to teach it.
That was the end
of our hopes for Mizushima.
We couldn't learn any details.
We didn't even have a way
to search for his remains.
We could only believe
he had died in battle.
It's been five days already.
Can't you see
that whatever you do is futile?
The armies of Britain and Japan
can come and fight all they wish.
Burma is still Burma.
Burma is the Buddha's country.
I'm starving.
- Which way is Mudon?
- I don't know.
- Which way is south?
- That way.
A Japanese cartridge.
They're here too.
Aren't you going to Mudon?
Yes, but the corpses
of the Japanese soldiers —
In Burma, the bones of many
foreign soldiers lie unburied.
It's a terrible pity.
You may take
this boat to Mudon.
Thank you.
Please be our guest in this room
whenever you visit Mudon.
You seem to have undergone
some very severe training.
Good night.
At last.
Tomorrow is the day!
They’ll be so surprised
to see me like this.
Playing so early?
I'm sorry.
I play the harp for money.
Why do you play that tune?
If I play this,
the English give me money.
May I play?
Please teach me
to play like that.
They're sure
to give me more money.
I’ll teach you,
but the monks will complain
if we play here.
The British hospital workers
are singing a hymn.
A Japanese soldier
probably died this morning.
Aren't you going
to the prison camp?
The camp is the other way.
Mizushima!
Don't scare him like that.
That monk was
Mizushima after all.
But we couldn't know that
at the time.
I know now
that I can't go back with them.
It's a Burmese ruby!
Strange to find
such a big one along the river.
Must be
the spirit of the dead.
Hey...
What is it?
That music.
It's a harp.
Who's playing it?
- That's a famous song.
- I don't mean that.
I mean the way it's played.
The way the notes
are played together.
That's how Mizushima played it.
- It's the kid we saw at the temple.
Let's ask
who taught him how to play.
What do you think?
If Mizushima's alive,
is there any reason
he wouldn't want to return to us?
- There can't be!
- Unthinkable!
Why was that boy
playing Mizushima's song?
How do you know
it was Mizushima's?
We don't, but the captain says
it was his style.
And the captain's a musician.
Mizushima died on Triangle Mountain.
How could he teach the kid?
- Maybe before he died.
- Idiot! He didn't have time.
- Did anyone see him die?
- You saying he didn't?
- We can't be sure.
- I've seen deserters pose as monks.
The monk on the bridge
may actually have been Mizushima.
- That's right!
- Why didn't he say anything?
That man didn't understand
Japanese.
But he looked just like him.
That's enough!
Captain...
I know it's disappointing
to hear this,
but I think it's best
to forget about Mizushima.
He died bravely
trying to carry out his mission.
To doubt his death
is actually
to dishonor his spirit.
When dressed as a native,
he looked exactly like one.
By the same token, there must be
Burmese who look just like him.
You believe he's alive,
so you think you see him
or think you hear his harp playing.
I'm grateful that you care
so much for your men,
but you’ll only hurt your men
if you let worry ruin your health.
There's no hope for him.
Please just give up.
I suppose you're right.
Attention!
Eyes right!
Face front!
At ease!
Isn't that Mizushima?
Hey!
Mizushima...
let's return to Japan together.
Let's return to Japan together.
Let's return to Japan together.
We're getting nowhere.
Maybe that's too hard for you.
Please just check
one more time.
That's impossible.
We've done all we can.
The troops that took Triangle Mountain
have returned home.
The Japanese survivors
aren't in this town.
But that tune —
You hear
a certain way of playing,
a few notes
floating on the breeze,
and it's enough to make you think
a dead man is alive.
You must be dreaming.
Mizushima...
let's return to Japan together.
You got it! Good boy!
Captain!
What's the point
of training it to say that?
I know how much you regret
Mizushima's death,
but such behavior is unmanly.
Hearing this bird
repeat those words day and night
will only demoralize us.
We're already
homesick as it is!
I beg of you, sir:
Pull yourself together.
We all saw that monk
carrying a white box of ashes.
That's a Japanese custom!
I thought it odd too,
but there's a similar custom in Burma.
He was the only one
carrying a white box.
I have to find out
who that monk is.
If we meet again,
I’ll put this parrot on his shoulder.
If it's Mizushima,
he’ll respond
to what the bird says.
If he doesn't,
then I’ll know I'm wrong...
and I’ll give up.
I'm sorry to put you all
through this.
Bear with me
just a little longer.
Mizushima...
so it was you after all.
Now that I see this box here,
I know for sure.
Mizushima...
what happened
on Triangle Mountain?
And what happened after that?
I know nothing.
But I think I know how you feel.
You've made a weighty decision.
How hard it must have been.
High in the castle in springtime
At a flower-viewing banquet
The sake goblet
makes the rounds
Casting its shadow
against the walls
Moonlight shines
Through boughs
Of ancient pine
Where has it gone
That light of days long past
- It's Mizushima!
- That's his harp!
- It's coming from the forest!
- No!
It's coming from that buddha!
Mizushima!
If you're in there, open up!
Can't you hear us?
Mizushima!
That's Sergeant Ito's voice.
That's Kawakami.
That's Baba.
Hey, everybody!
We're going home!
The repatriation order arrived!
We leave in three days!
Really?
The captain said so.
He's at headquarters now!
Mizushima!
Let's return to Japan together.
That's right.
That stubborn bastard Mizushima.
We have to take him
back to Japan!
Mizushima, show your face!
Let me think.
How can we get this parrot
on that monk's shoulder?
We only have three days!
Well, at least now
we can go around and look for him.
I've got an idea!
We’ll start singing tomorrow real loud.
He's bound to show up.
Your company really likes to sing.
Deep in the countryside
of Shinoda
The mother fox
Longs for her cub
Deep in the countryside
a red dragonfly...
- I don't think he's coming.
- I'm losing my voice.
Whose bright idea
was this anyway?
Look! The old lady!
Congratulations!
I heard you're going home.
I'm very happy for you.
I wish you happiness
back home in Japan.
Thanks for all your help.
I’ll tell my mother back home
all about you.
You've all suffered so much.
Old lady...
something to remember us by.
Thank you.
Here's another memento.
This is for you.
This is a good-luck charm.
Thank you very much.
People started calling me
“the Japanese granny.”
It’ll be lonely here without you.
Still speaking
in Osaka dialect, eh?
I always will.
That's the Japanese
the officers stationed here taught me.
Is it now?
Old lady, do you think
you could give
this parrot to that monk?
That's impossible.
He's a wandering monk,
and a highly revered one too,
but nobody knows where he is.
We're leaving tomorrow.
We're not asking you
to search all over Burma,
but if you see him,
could you give him the bird?
What a strange request.
We have enormous respect
for that monk too.
In that case, I’ll do it.
Don't worry.
Really?
From now on,
you’ll be with your brother
on the monk's shoulder,
serving Buddha together.
Please make sure he gets it.
I’ll visit again before you leave.
Good-bye, and thanks again!
I wonder if she’ll really do it.
She doesn't seem very serious.
We have no other choice.
There's nothing else we can do.
At least there's a chance.
Finished packing?
There's nothing to pack.
Just put me on that boat.
What's wrong with your voices?
He said Mizushima
would show up if we sang.
Now we all have sore throats.
That was stupid.
Captain...
don't you care
if Mizushima doesn't come back?
He's coming!
What?
- Who's coming?
- He's coming!
- You reek of booze!
- Mizushima!
Where?
I mean, that monk
is outside the fence.
That same beggar kid
is with him.
He has two parrots
on his shoulders.
Hey, Mizushima!
Let's return to Japan together.
The old woman found him.
That's our parrot.
But Mizushima never had
such a vacant look.
Maybe it's not him.
How about if we sing?
Mizushima,
we're going home tomorrow!
- It's good you came back!
- Come back with us!
What's the matter?
Say something!
Mizushima!
Mizushima,
what happened to you?
- Good day.
- Old lady!
We've got nothing left to trade.
These are for you.
Free of charge.
No, I can't go back.
That's a strange phrase to learn.
Get that damn bird out of here!
This is the other parrot.
He kept the one you gave him.
He told me to bring you
this one in return.
What?
He asked me to give this
to the captain.
He asked me to do that,
and since it's the last thing
I can do for you,
I brought it.
Time to go!
There's a letter from Mizushima.
There's no time now.
I’ll read it later.
But Captain,
what if Mizushima changed his —
Mizushima isn't going
to change his mind.
Even if I read this now,
it wouldn't make any difference.
Ready for departure!
All units ready for departure.
Company, forward march!
At ease, march!
Is everyone here?
I'm going to read
Mizushima's letter.
I think I understand
how he feels.
When I went
to the repository that day
and saw that white box,
I understood.
But I felt uneasy
and said nothing about it.
I think this letter
will answer your questions.
“My captain
and brothers at arms...
it's difficult to express
how much I miss you all,
how much I want to join you,
work with you,
talk with you
and sing with you.
It's even harder to express
how I long to return
to my war-ravaged country
and see the ones I love.
But I cannot return.
I cannot leave the bodies
of my comrades lying scattered
along the hills
and rivers of Burma.
It was when
I turned back for them
that I met you on the bridge.
I can't express
how I felt at that moment,
but by then
I had already decided to stay.
I couldn't rejoin you,
or even tell you my name.
I had only one intention,
and that was to hurry north.
No, I can't go back.
As I climbed mountains
and crossed rivers,
burying the bodies left
in the grasses and streams,
my heart was racked
with questions.
Why must the world
suffer such misery?
Why must there be
such inexplicable pain?
As the days passed,
I came to understand.
I realized that, in the end,
the answers were not
for human beings to know,
that our work is simply to ease
the great suffering of the world.
To have the courage
to face suffering, senselessness
and irrationality without fear,
to find the strength to create peace
by one's own example.
I will undergo
whatever training is necessary
for this to become
my unshakable conviction.
The Burmese priest
who has been my teacher
has formally accepted me
into the priesthood.
The captain's words
that we should all return
and work together
to rebuild our country...
are still fresh in my memory.
But when I saw how many dead
were left behind,
I could no longer
feel the same way.
I will stay behind
to create a place
where those thousands
of young souls can find repose.
After many years,
when that task is done,
I may return to Japan if possible.
But even then I may not.
My life may end here.
I'm writing to you
from my room in the monastery.
The parrot you sent me...
sometimes says the words
it learned from you:
'Hey, Mizushima,
let's return to Japan together.'
Each time I hear those words,
I'm startled.
Today, filled with unbearable sadness,
I forgot my monastic vows...
and played a song of farewell
to you on my harp.
I am now resigned to my fate.
There is no end
to words of farewell.
Those of you
who still think of me,
please accept
my deepest thanks.
From snow-capped mountains
to the coast where
the Southern Cross shines,
I shall wander
throughout Burma.
Whenever my loneliness
becomes unbearable, I’ll play my harp.
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.
I shall always pray
for your happiness.
Yasuhiko Mizushima.”
When I get back to my house
in the mulberry orchard,
I’ll take a nice long nap
on the veranda.
I wonder what's become
of the factory.
I miss the sound
of those motors.
I’ll whistle as I ride my bike
through the Ginza delivering telegrams.
And I’ll go to movies and —
You really think
it’ll all be so easy?
You really think Mizushima
will never come back?
What?
You never cared about him before.
What's gotten into you?
Let Mizushima
lead his own life.
Everyone lives as he pleases.
I was a station employee...
It's true that I hadn't given
Mizushima much thought before.
I didn't even think about him much
as we sailed home.
All I thought about
was how his family would feel
as they read his letter.
In an oddly sincere way,
I hoped the captain would find
a good way to explain it.
THE SOIL OF BURMA IS RED,
AND SO ARE ITS ROCKS...
THE END
