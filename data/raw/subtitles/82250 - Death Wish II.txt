This is KABC radio. I'm Geri Nichols.
Latest crime statistics released today
show an alarming rise in violence.
In the last five years, homicides in
Los Angeles County are up 79%.
Robberies are up 68%.
Aggravated assault, another violent
crime, shows an increase of 59%.
Rapes have increased 61%,
and lesser crimes are up too.
Today I spoke to Los Angeles Police
Commissioner Herman Baldwin.
The fear of crime has
deteriorated our community.
It's almost as if we've been struck
by enemy bombs.
The number of citizens
killed and maimed...
... has produced in me a great
and personal resolve.
The only way we'll win...
Make no mistake. This is a war.
The only way we'll win is
by assuming the offensive.
Positive policing is the answer.
We've got to deploy all our resources...
... or criminal violence will
destroy our community.
What are the resources needed to
diminish the alarming rise in crimes?
Some say heavier prison sentences and
an increased police facility are enough.
I'm one of them.
Others believe that prison
never cured anyone.
Judging by the rise in violence,
it never deterred anyone either.
Here comes the commercial.
It's your radio station, and I sure like
Ms. Nichols, but I can't take this.
It's not my station.
I'm the architect for the new one.
- Ms. Nichols is late.
- She's still on the radio.
They recorded that earlier.
- Hey, there she is now.
- Don't be late for dinner.
- Your daughter ate well last time.
- You're a great cook.
- For her, nothing is too much.
- We won't be late.
- We should be there at 10:30.
- We'll make it.
The senator's aide would not
get off the phone.
Los Angeles Magazine went for my idea
of articles on criminal rehabilitation.
That's great.
Hello, baby. You look really good.
Hi, Carol. We're not late, are we?
Has there been progress
this week, doctor?
She asked for dinner
on Thursday night.
That's the fifth week running
she's said a few words.
That's not much after two years.
Will she ever come back to me?
Will she ever be normal again?
You're her father, Mr. Kersey.
You can only give her your love,
and your prayers too.
I remember you liked kites when you
were a kid. You still like them?
We haven't bought your ice cream yet.
You mean your ice cream.
A man has to have some vices.
But I'll tell you what.
You choose whatever you want from
this table, and I'll go buy the ice cream.
Look at him.
What do you think?
Let's do it.
Out the way, motherfucker.
Out the way.
Watch out, asshole.
Go get your ice cream, man.
Asshole.
That's nice.
- Where's my wallet?
- I ain't got it.
When I got to the front of the line,
I discovered I forgot my wallet.
This time you two come with me.
But I'll have to borrow some money.
I think we can manage that.
Carol, where've you been?
I haven't seen you for a while.
I thought you deserted me.
What happened, Paul?
- Nothing.
- You didn't forget your wallet.
- You never forget anything.
- I'll tell you about it later.
I could stay.
- I could do the interview another time.
- The senator's only here for a day.
I wouldn't miss the opportunity.
I'll see you at dinner, okay?
- Okay.
- Hey, Paul! You coming aboard?
This is the place.
Super fine.
Easy, my man. We got business.
Who is it?
I got a delivery for Mr. Kersey.
Who from?
Who is this delivery from?
Just her. No one else here.
- We want to give Kersey his wallet back.
- Personally.
Hey, man, look at that.
Isn't that pretty?
No! No! No!
No! No!
You disturb the neighbors,
I'll cut you up...
...and eat you for dinner.
Hey, Jiver, save some for me, man.
Getting her good, Jiver.
Getting her good.
My turn now, man.
You want her? Take her into bed.
Jiver, check out the window
for the man.
No!
- We can't hang in here forever.
- Hey, I want him.
Just be cool, man.
He'll come.
Nirvana, you want a bit?
- Is there any left?
- There's enough.
You wait in here. Watch for the man.
All right now, lady, quietly.
Do it nice.
Are you hungry?
Let's see what Rosario has for dinner.
Rosario.
Rosario, we're home.
- Stop the whore.
- Get her, man.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Use the back! Take her.
She's seen us. She can finger us all.
Come on.
Keep moving. Get in there, girl.
There is only one truth about the use
of the death penalty:
Why do we kill people who kill people
to show that killing is wrong?
Thank you. That was
Senator Robert McLean.
This has been News Desk...
...brought to you by KABC,
Los Angeles. I'm Geri Nichols.
Nirvana, how long we gotta stay here?
It's nice here.
Yeah, and we got a nice little lady.
What are we gonna do?
- Do we waste her?
- She's seen us. She can finger us all.
The man saw me twice, up close.
Man, we look all the same
to whitey anyway.
He'll never pick you out, Jiver.
I'm gonna fuck you, lady.
You're strange.
Paul!
Paul?
Paul, is that you?
I'm Inspector Mankiewicz.
- I know it's a terrible time.
- Any news of my daughter?
No. As soon as we hear,
we'll let you know.
The descriptions you gave
the officers about your attackers...
...they're very unclear. Is there
anything that you can add?
I came in here. There were two men
there and at least two men back there.
One hits me on the head,
and I'm unconscious.
Surely you saw one of them
before you were attacked.
I told your men everything I know.
We understand a similar thing
happened in New York.
We ran it down in our computer.
Yeah, that's right.
Muggers followed my wife
and daughter from the market.
The police there got
a good description of the muggers.
It didn't do any good.
We do what we can.
One of my men found this
on the floor.
If they don't need us, let's go
to my place. They'll be all night.
Mr. Kersey, we just got some news
about your daughter.
How is she?
Is this your daughter, Mr. Kersey?
Mr. Kersey, is that Carol?
Get some sleep, darling.
You go on back to bed.
I wanna stay here a while.
I'll be along in a moment.
And to almighty God we commend
the soul of our sister Carol.
And we commit her body
to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust...
...in sure and certain hope of the
resurrection, unto eternal life...
...through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Don't worry about the new building.
It can wait.
I'll be back soon.
It's not necessary.
It is for me.
Thanks for the use of your cabin.
This is the new model. The Department
of Building and Safety approved it.
Has Elliott chosen a building type?
We drew how it might look
in three different renderings...
...so we can compare them.
Call and make an appointment,
and I'll run it over.
His wife will make the choice,
but we'll let him look anyway.
Get me Mr. Cass at the radio station.
Our market is local news.
Fires, traffic jams, droughts.
I'm not so sure, Elliott. We got
awards for international reporting.
I don't care about awards.
KBEX's local news has kept us out
of first place too long.
If you want, we'll take them on,
traffic jam for traffic jam.
Paul. See you later. Why didn't
somebody tell me you were here?
Got some news. Your building's
been approved.
What's it gonna cost me?
In the steel frame with reflective
glass, it'll cost $250 a square foot.
Wooden frame, $100 a square foot.
Concrete, $150 a square foot.
All the figures are right here.
- I can't believe these prices.
- Welcome back.
- I see you made a noisy comeback.
- Hello. Go ahead.
- I heard you were here.
- I was just gonna come see you.
See you tonight?
Geri, I don't feel like I'm fit company
for socializing. Not yet anyway.
Paul, are you out there?
- Come on back.
- Okay.
I was at your office.
They told me you'd be here.
Come look at some mug shots.
See if you can pick out those people.
You know, it happened so fast.
No, I don't think so.
The pictures might jog your memory.
There really isn't any use.
My heart's desire and prayer to God for
Israel, is that they might be saved.
We will find in Romans 10:9 and 10...
...that if thou confess
with thou mouth Jesus...
...and believe that God
hath raised him from the dead...
...thou shall be saved. For
with the heart...
- What are you looking for?
- A room.
No trouble here, you hear?
Fifty dollars a month. No TV.
No music after 11.
And no police, Mr.?
Kimball.
- No police, you hear?
- I hear.
Shall I join you?
It's you.
Who were you expecting?
Raquel Welch?
What brings you here?
I thought I'd come see you.
It doesn't happen often these days.
Half my wardrobe's here.
I'm getting bored with the other half.
Geri, I'm gonna be a while.
Go and do what you're gonna do...
...and I'll see you back in the office.
Thanks for calling
General Lock Company.
Hello, yes.
I have locks that need changing.
Could you do it for me today, please?
That's them. There they are.
Let's go.
You and you, out. Not you.
- You believe in Jesus?
- Yes, I do.
Well, you're gonna meet him.
- Mr. Kersey, you wanna join the party?
- No, thanks.
- Hello.
- You're in.
I've been in all night.
- I called.
- I haven't been answering the phone.
The newspaper people keep calling ever
since... I just haven't been answering.
Can I cook dinner
for you tomorrow night?
- Friday night's better.
- Friday night then.
Okay. Bye.
Two men were shot dead in the vacant
Hollywood Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard.
Police believe the two deaths
are drug-related.
Names withheld
till families are notified.
It's 9:00 in Los Angeles.
Temperature's 72 degrees.
We'll go to Jane Saunders for traffic.
There's a holdup on Hollywood at
Western, where there's a traffic accident.
So, drivers,
avoid Hollywood at Western.
- That's it, give them the local news.
- Drive carefully. Stop for any car wrecks.
My car's such a mess, a few more bangs
wouldn't make a difference.
Here's Geri with news of an experiment
that's taking people away from crime.
In Illinois State Prison...
- Get off of me! No!
- Come on.
Stop!
Please help!
Please!
- I will be good.
- Mary!
Find your mama, motherfucker!
No! Don't hurt Mary!
Beat it!
No! Please! Please!
Hey, watch out, asshole!
Goodbye.
Let's go, Tommy. Come with me.
Hey, over here.
Hold it a minute.
Let me get this straight.
Some guy pops out, he starts shooting,
and you don't know what he looks like.
That guy saved our lives, damn it.
Where were you guys,
giving out parking tickets?
Hold them.
All right, lady, what did he look like?
He was...
He was...
- He was a very good citizen.
- He was a killer.
Now, you wanna stay here forever?
Play it that way. You're vital witnesses.
Don't play games with me.
You both saw him. I want the description.
He's 21, blond, with a clubbed foot.
Funny, from where I was, he was
a large black man with a red beard.
Let these guys get me
to the hospital...
...or I'm gonna give the press
interviews you won't believe.
Take him.
You know what we got here, don't you?
A goddamn vigilante.
My wife goes to Mace class,
would you believe that?
The police commissioner's wife at
Mace class, learning to spray attackers.
Now you tell me
there's a vigilante out there.
My God, the lid's only
just kept down as it is.
I can see panicked citizens taking
to the streets if this gets out.
- They'll knock off anyone with long hair.
- I think I can find him.
If we investigate, the press will know.
I learn half of what goes on
in my own force from the newspapers.
Tell me...
...wasn't there a vigilante in Boston
about five years ago?
- New York.
- New York. Right.
See how they handled it.
It stopped there.
- Well, what about this report? You've...
- I know.
The Los Angeles police has asked
for advice on their vigilante situation.
But there's something else
you should know, sir.
Paul Kersey now lives in Los Angeles.
You suggesting Kersey's
out there killing again?
Paul Kersey was an interesting man,
so I kept a loose tab on him.
He worked in Chicago for a while...
...where he met an old friend
who ran a radio station in L. A...
...and he transferred
his business out there.
But that doesn't mean
that he's the Los Angeles vigilante.
- No, sir.
- But, Christ, what if he is?
Yes, sir.
If he is, and if he's caught,
the trail leads straight back to us.
- We had him, and we didn't prosecute.
- For damn good reason.
Street crime was down 50 percent.
Muggers were afraid to go out.
We know we'd have a martyr
on our hands if we prosecuted.
But the fact is, we let him go.
If he's caught now,
he'll say we let him go.
I'd be disbarred. It'd be the
end of your career, commissioner.
And you, inspector,
would not collect your pension.
And I retire this year.
It's simple.
We have to get him before they do.
We?
You.
Well, I could go to Los Angeles
in answer to their request.
I'll try to find out if Kersey's
up to his old tricks again.
And if he is, I'll try to stop him...
...quietly.
- Kill him?
- Hi, Frank. Over here.
- Mike. Good to see you.
- Frank, welcome to L.A.
- Thank you.
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you. Is this the file?
Newspaper clippings
and police photographs on Kersey.
Most of them
are about how his daughter...
...and his housekeeper
were killed by muggers.
Checked out every person who suffered
a loss by mugging in the last six months.
- How many people did that give you?
- Deaths, 96. Seriously injured, 1500.
Rapes, 579. I can go on.
Tie down a lot of men that way.
- What did you do?
- We tried that route, but we gave up.
I'm going to the hotel to lie down.
I caught a cold on the plane.
- And this smog doesn't help anyway.
- You're not holding out on me, are you?
One cop to another,
would I do a thing like that?
It's all right, Ms. Nichols,
I'm a policeman.
- How did you get in?
- It comes with the job.
You'd be amazed what they teach us.
What's a New York cop doing
breaking into my apartment?
- It's about your friend Paul Kersey.
- How do you know him?
- It comes...
- With the job.
He killed nine people
in New York City four years ago.
- You're not serious.
- I'm very serious.
- What station are you from?
- West 75th Street.
- It won't help calling anybody.
- They sent you.
Well, not exactly.
- Was he charged with killing nine people?
- He was not.
You see,
the people he killed were muggers.
Even though the public never knew
who he was, he became a hero.
And there were those that felt we should
encourage him to stop, leave it at that.
But now, you see,
he's doing it again...
...here in Los Angeles.
- There's no one I can call to verify this?
- My chief thinks I'm on vacation.
You break in here, and you tell me
you think Paul's a murderer.
- What else are you entitled to tell me?
- It'd be better if he stopped.
I asked him once, didn't seem to work.
I think maybe he'll listen to you.
I hardly see him outside
of the radio station.
Doesn't it make you wonder
what he may be doing at night?
Hey, mister, got a half-hour to spare?
What's wrong with you?
Haven't you got one? Fuck you!
- Where have you been?
- I was just out.
- Out where?
- I was with a friend. A man.
- What man?
- Calm down.
Where do you think I've been?
Killing muggers.
You're crazy.
A New York cop broke
into my place tonight.
Not that... What the hell's
his name? Frank Ochoa.
- Well, he said he talked to you once.
- He asked me not to kill muggers.
He told me that.
Yes, that's true.
- Did you kill muggers?
- No, but he asked me not to.
Why would he ask you not to
if you weren't doing it?
Listen, when a policeman finds a killer,
what does he do?
They arrest him.
Well, he did seem a bit odd.
Not only odd, the guy is crazy.
It's that simple.
He had a moment in his life
when he was a somebody.
He was in charge
of the vigilante killings in New York.
He was all over the newspapers,
the television, asked a lot of questions.
The most important question they
asked him was, "Who is the vigilante?
Have you found him?" He hadn't.
Me, I was one on a long list of people
who had family killed by the muggers.
He might have accused
every one of them.
But he became such a damn pest
that I left New York.
But I'll be damned
if I leave Los Angeles.
I'm not gonna let him
come between you and me.
- I thought things had.
- What?
Come between us.
Hell, no.
- Stay the night?
- I thought you'd never ask.
- Do I get a key again?
- Oh, yeah.
Here, have it copied.
Don't lose it. We may not be able
to get back in tonight.
- I can't see you tonight.
- Why not?
It's Judith's birthday. I'm staying
with her in Carmel after the party.
Now who's keeping us apart?
Hello. Frank, hi.
Mike. I hate to ask you this
after you've been so helpful...
...but could you do something
for me tonight?
- Yeah, what is it?
- Take my car...
... and park it outside the front
of Paul Kersey's house.
Police!
Follow that bus.
It says " proclaimed by God himself"
in the scriptures.
He's the prince
of the kings of the earth.
One of these days,
he'll be called King of Kings.
Yes, prince of kings
is just the beginning of his glory.
We must confess it now.
That if thou shall confess
the Lord Jesus in thy bounty...
Taxi! Come on, will you?
Follow that bus.
It isn't moving.
When it moves, follow it.
- What do we do now?
- We wait.
- Can I see something?
- Stop it!
Just let me check the color.
I really am nice,
but you act like a fool around me.
Now that bus there.
- I hope you got the bread.
- Police business.
I ain't known for my community spirit.
Show me some money.
Here. Start with this.
Go ahead, will you?
Stop it!
Come on. Leave me alone.
Give me a break, guys.
- What's down there?
- Point Fermin.
- What's that?
- A historical monument.
- Nothing there this time of night.
- Wait here.
You get the other half
when I get back. Whatever happens...
...wait here.
If you hear shooting, don't worry.
It's just target practice.
What's happening? Where you been?
- Let's see it.
- Show the man.
Now this is the best.
This stuff is sweet like sugar.
Watch out!
What the fuck is going on?
He's over there, man!
What the fuck is this?
Fuck it, man.
I'll be damned. You.
You stuck your neck out for me?
It was you or them.
- Did you get them all?
- One of them got away.
Get the motherfucker for me.
Our Father who art in heaven...
...hallowed be thy...
He's dead.
I knew he was holding out on me.
Lieutenant, over here!
- Who blew away the cop?
- I'm bleeding, man.
Who did it?
No sign of the cab that called.
Cab service said he was just passing by.
They want to stay out of trouble.
Listen. You'll die right here
if I don't hear who killed that cop.
Nirvana. He got away.
How's that?
Charles Wilson!
You fuck!
Put out a tracer on Nirvana, also known
as Charles Wilson, for murder.
No hurry.
How can an entrance door
cost $500,000?
Your wife
is a very expensive designer.
She wants Italian marble,
Mexican mosaic...
...sculpted angels blowing horns
on either side.
Costs a lot of money.
But here we've drawn it up
in concrete.
Even has the angels on either side.
Costs a lot less.
Ask your wife about it.
She'll hate it.
Ask her anyhow.
Let me know either way.
Do you know what time
they'll make their move?
Sergeant, please keep
those calls coming in.
What's happening?
Big shootout at Point Fermin.
Five killed, including a New York cop.
Our man says the TAC squad's
been called in.
I want you glued
to those police monitors.
A man called Wilson got away.
Word is they may move
to take him this afternoon.
If they do, I want someone there.
We could use an exclusive.
- Where do you get these monitors?
- We adapt them ourselves.
- Happen to have a spare one?
- There was one we were gonna get rid of.
Here. We got better ones now,
but this one still works.
A gift from KABC radio.
The TAC squad, they operate on
this band, and they identify with 3-A-90.
Their programs are a lot more
interesting than ours.
Thanks, Fred.
3- A-68, subject's residence
located as 914 Fillmore.
Units moving into position.
5- H-13, this is 3-A-90.
We could use a definite 10-20.
Affirmative, 914 Fillmore.
Stay clear.
No units move in till I give the word.
Squad 3 moving into position. Over.
5- H-13, this is 3-A-90.
We have eyeball on your 10-30. Over.
They spot you?
No. We're across from the 10-20.
Can take him now.
- Hold it, he's mine.
- Standing by.
3- A-90...
... this is 5-C-61.
Subject just entered 10-20
with two X's.
3- A-46. Subject lighting
narcotics. Permission to move in.
Negative. I don't want those women
involved. Wait till he comes out.
George, got a cigarette?
Section 804, await instructions.
This is 3-A-90.
Someone's on the roof...
... of 914. Confirm it was one of us.
How do I know who it is?
Hold positions.
Don't give me that shit.
Fuck off, asshole. I'm getting...
Give me that stuff!
Watch out! He's got a knife.
The streets are too crowded.
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Okay, let's get him.
Come on, hold him down.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How was the birthday?
We're getting a bit old for birthdays.
You see this?
Oh, yeah, I saw it.
- Do you know anything about it?
- No more than you do.
I understand KABC got an exclusive when
they caught the guy who killed him.
I heard it in the car.
- Have you eaten?
- No, I drove here when I heard.
- Let's go to a nice place.
- I'd like to freshen up.
- How long will it take? An hour?
- About.
Pick you up in an hour.
- You know, I rather liked him.
- He was nutty, like I told you.
At least they caught
the man that killed him.
Prosecution has presented
only circumstantial evidence...
...that Charles Wilson shot
and killed Detective Frank Ochoa...
...on the night of May 14.
It is proven that he attacked
police officers...
...on May 15.
But psychiatric testimony...
...indicates he was influenced by PCP,
a mind-altering drug.
" Charles I. Wilson was remanded
to the McLarren State Hospital...
...till such time
as a medical examining board...
...finds him fit
to resume his place in society."
I suppose this is the Dr. Clark
that'll turn him into a little angel?
Would a normal prison do any better?
It would keep him
from killing somebody else.
All this stuff in your article?
When's it come out?
I've got a couple more sessions at the
hospital. It's due to go in the July issue.
You really believe all this?
Yes, I do. You might too
if you heard Clark.
You think he'd swing me over?
If you met him you might learn some.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're right.
- I'm sorry to have kept you.
- Dr. Clark, this is Mr. Kersey.
I'm glad you came. The more people
who understand our work, the better.
I appreciate your letting me come.
Say, doctor, where is the men's room?
Let me show you.
Straight down the hall, around
the corner and second on your left.
Thank you.
The right.
You're late.
Look, they gave me the cover.
How about that.
" Next month, Geri Nichols on crime and
punishment in Los Angeles." Terrific.
Think he'll give me a raise?
He might give you a reduction
because of all the hours at the hospital.
You've spent enough time there.
You know the place as well as I do.
But I'm still not converted.
All those theories are just theories.
Dom Perignon?
Can't be my birthday.
That was last month. You forgot.
But that's all right.
Will you marry me?
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
You're not sick?
Might be after I see the check.
But I feel fine now.
Easy. This stuff cost $3 a drop.
That was a $9 kiss.
I accept. That'll teach you.
Next Wednesday we'll catch a flight
to Acapulco and get married in Mexico.
I thought you weren't a romantic.
After the program
you drive to my place, and off we go.
Let's get smashed.
Then I want it in writing.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient.
Charles Wilson.
I believe he's in...
...C- block. Is that right?
Yes, C-block, section 6, room 30.
It's that way.
Thank you.
I'm Dr. Carter. Court-appointed
therapist for Charles Wilson.
- I don't have your name here.
- My appointment's for 9:00.
They give me a list.
I was told a Mr. Kay
would be here on duty.
- That's me, but I can't let you...
- Mr. Kay, I'm already late.
I'd like to finish up and get home.
Now, if you don't mind,
would you please show me to room 30?
- Hi, Ilene. Cook it all by yourself?
- That's right.
If you don't wanna stay for dinner,
