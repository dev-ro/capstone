You good?
Yeah.
From all of us down
here in Mission Control,
welcome to Space Care, buster.
Now you're a real astronaut.
Contact and capture confirmed.
The Russians always
knock three times.
It's their way of
telling us it's time
to start paying attention.
Though, I think it's
just a superstition.
Our guys just swing
the shit open.
Which one? Wait, Ashley, right?
- No, Mia.
- Oh, okay.
- She made the dress.
- Aw, cute.
She's my youngest.
Ashley's not really
speaking to me right now.
She's at that age where
her mother is, my ex,
is probably tellin' her that,
"Oh, you know, daddy's..."
Oh, mother of God, yes!
Finally!
What took you guys so long?
- Welcome!
- Hey!
How do you feel, good?
- Good, right?
- No.
Yeah.
- Zero gravity.
- You're better, huh?
- You need food?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.
- Let's go get some food.
- Let's get dinner.
Alright!
That's no shift.
I'm good, thank
you, um, Weronika?
- Nika.
- Nika, 50 days.
Yeah, that's exciting.
Yeah and I'm making all
of us celebrate this,
along with your
arrival, of course.
Of course. That's very nice.
Okay, now...
The important thing?
Good job.
It means the important thing
is that we stick together.
It's a quote from the
famous astronaut Buzz.
My training partner
over there, Alexey,
he and I say it all the time.
- Ah, Buzz Aldrin.
- No, the other Buzz.
- Lightyear.
- Okay, Russian dad joke.
You just welcome
Weronika aboard.
- Oh, it's her first day.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's alright. Takes a minute.
Put your feet in the foot
holes. Isn't that better?
Yeah. Thanks.
The blue handles
are your friends.
Nika was just helping
me get more acclimated.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Get lost.
Weronika, back to work.
Foster. Let's, uh, let's
get you stowed away.
Okay.
This is you, port side.
Your glorified phone booth.
You got your bed, uh,
your computer up here.
Here's your alarm speaker.
Well, everything I was promised.
Now, look,
no one knows what kind
of sleeper they'll be
'til they get up here.
I get in the bag.
Christian's a floater, literally
floats the entire night.
My advice to you: Start
in a bag, go from there.
It will suck, but
it will get better.
Alright, Node 2 back there,
that's pretty much your
home away from home.
Do whatever you want
in your sleep station.
Sleep, watch movies,
the Internet never really works,
so it's a pain in the ass when
you want to try to video chat
with your loved ones.
Wanna take a little
break, try to reach them,
try and make contact?
No.
Cool.
That little hum you're hearing,
that's our life support.
You hear that hum and
everything's right as rain.
When you don't hear that hum,
that's when you
can start to panic.
Yep.
Like I said, we share
everything up here.
So, if you want to avoid
someone looking for an
extra pair of watch glasses
and accidentally ruining
months of your research,
just lock it up with this key.
Works on any American lock.
You can use Russian cabinets,
but you just gotta trade keys.
Do you mind if I take a
minute and just set up
and get my little guys
acquainted, put some things away?
Yeah, no problem. You want me to
you want me to hang out or
you want to do it alone?
No, I got it.
Uh, okay. We're
happy you're here.
- Thank you.
- Take your time.
Alright. Oh, you were
takin' a nap, weren't you?
I know. Okay.
I know, I know, I know, I
know. You're doin' good.
Yep, yep, yep. Good job!
I know it's weird. Here you go.
Gotta hold, hold, hold, hold,
hold. Hi, little booger.
I miss you too.
Look at that. Stay, stay, stay.
Hello, doctor.
Hello.
You alright? You alright?
There you go. Good job.
I hear we'll be working closely.
I'm sorry. My Russian is
not very good right now.
No, it's good.
It's good. Alright.
Better than my American.
I'm a doctor.
- Pulov?
- Da.
No, I read a translation
of your thesis
on the contagious
cancers amongst Tas Devs.
I'd actually like to talk to you
because there's a direct
correlation with my...
I don't, um...
If you could...?
- Oh, God!
- Yes.
- Oh, I...
- I don't want, impolite.
- Oh, we're sharing?
- Yes.
Ah.
Thank you.
Horribly embarrassing.
I know. Oh, sorry, little man.
We've done many of these.
- Mice?
- Yes.
Right, I read about the
thyroid fabrications.
How is that?
Yes. We've done many with
mice. They're afraid up here.
Nothing to hold on to. It...
I'm sorry?
It does not end well.
It was nice meeting you.
Welcome aboard, doctor.
- Not again.
- Wow!
- That's a thing we do here?
- Yep.
They didn't tell you I'd be
playing with fire up here?
Well, playing with fire
was highly discouraged.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You've got your mice.
I've got my babies too,
and I miss them very much.
- Aw.
- I don't know why
they put us in the gym, though.
Well, they put a
toilet here as well.
You don't hear me
complaining, do you?
Hey, Kira.
- Hi!
- He only complains
when I kick his ass at chess.
Oh, please! Watch
this, Captain Bubbles.
- He's showing off.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!
Major FAA violation, by the way.
Yeah, I know. I know that.
But my friend wants...
- Happy New Year.
- What's new?
Have a guess.
Well, a little shit.
I've always wanted
to see Siberia.
I come from the
west side of Russia,
so we have pine trees.
Incredible! You smell it.
- See that's what I'm...
- From miles away.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Your lungs open up.
I miss that. I miss that.
I'm gonna come and visit you.
We're gonna smell
the pines together.
I love this song.
- ♪ I follow the Moskva ♪
- Is that what I think it is?
♪ Down to Gorky Park ♪
♪ Listening to the
wind of change ♪
- Not bad!
- Here we go.
♪ An August summer night,
soldiers passing by ♪
♪ Listening to the
wind of change ♪
- Oh, boy.
- It's cruel.
Why you say cruel, Gordon?
- Not the song, the song...
- No, but this song was
an end of a bad life,
end of a bad era for
parents and grandparents.
- No, I, I didn't mean...
- We're not doing this.
The song's cruel,
I just meant...
What am I doing?
We don't talk politics
around here. Here, we're one.
We're evolved species.
It is not politics.
When you grow up like
we did, you know, right?
This song means something.
It means something
different to all of us.
Yeah, but it means a lot to me.
We don't talk about any of it.
We stay away from Syria, Israel.
I definitely don't
talk about my service.
And we sure as hell don't talk
about what's goin' on
down there right now.
Alexey, I'm sorry. I was
only... that was stupid.
I was just jokin' around.
It's bad joke.
Yeah, bad joke.
- Hey.
- It was stupid.
I wasn't sure before,
but now, it is exactly
the moment to present to you...
Oh, shit!
Ta-da!
- You thought I forgot.
- I wasn't gonna say anything.
Know how long it took
me to find this brand
for you, Christian? Never say
I don't do anything for you.
I'm honoured.
Alright, while I got y'all here,
Santa brought gifts for
everybody this time.
- Oh, oh!
- Here we go! Ooh!
Got this from your niece.
Oh, I think she really
captured you guys this time.
Gordon, look how
handsome you are.
- Which one?
- This one.
The one that says Gordon.
Sorry, Foster. I wasn't
sure what you'd be into.
Little something
from the gift shop.
The strap is the same
webbing that we use
in our tethers, so...
I can get you something
better next time.
Couldn't ask for
anything better.
- We do toast!
- Now?
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
Um, to Kira, new crew
members, welcome.
There is a trick to open
it. Don't do... nyet!
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no, no!
- Don't do that!
- Hey!
I forgot! I forgot, I forgot.
- You're going too fast.
- I swear I'm smart, I swear.
I'd like to show Foster the
Cupola for the first time.
Oh, no. You don't
have to do that.
If anyone's interested
in joining us?
- We could do it tomorrow.
- Listen, watching somebody
for the first time
seeing the Cupola,
- it never gets old.
- It's remarkable.
You'll never forget this day.
We don't have a lot to
get excited about up here,
and besides the YouTube tours,
they got nothing
on the real thing.
Oh, okay. Let's do it.
- Cupola, Cupola, Cupola!
- Okay, okay, okay!
Whoa!
I mean, I've seen
pictures, but this is...
You know, there's only about 500
or so people who saw what you're
seeing right now, so enjoy.
- Whoa!
- You forget about everything
that happens down there
when you can see the beauty
- from up here.
- Yeah.
- You like?
- Yeah.
God, that's beautiful.
Uh, it's great.
What?
What do I...? Okay,
I understood that.
What do I not feel?
It's okay, Kira,
you're not alone.
I've never actually
felt it either.
Well, what am I
supposed to feel?
It's the overview effect.
It's... you look at the
Earth and there's no borders.
For some people, it's
a spiritual awakening.
Like the whole world,
like humanity,
we're all connected
together or something.
I feel it!
Jesus!
You're fine.
One, two, three, four,
five. One, two, three, four.
Boo!
Hey, Kira...
The first night is the worst.
Here, get back in.
One, two.
It's better, isn't it?
I think that's what
missing up here,
feeling like you are, uh, held.
- Spasibo, Weronika.
- Nika.
- Mornin'.
- How'd you sleep?
Uh, okay.
Nice first day, right?
Computers are down.
Oh, and I thought Houston
was just being nice to me.
Don't get used to it.
Such crap, it just means
twice as much work later on.
Oh, is that what it means?
- Anything on your side?
- Hey, Christian.
- Yep.
- Do you know
that you sleep with
your eyes open?
- Because it's weird.
- I told you.
Yeah, I've been told.
You can have espresso
- if you want some.
- Good morning!
Good morning. How are we today?
Yeah?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh no...
Why did you do
this to each other?
I'm so sorry.
Hey, you didn't happen to
check in on my mice, did you?
No. Why?
Already gonna have to
euthanize some of 'em.
Oh, man. That's no good.
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.
- Nothing, still.
- Anything on your side?
Coffee anyone? I thought we'd
enjoy the sunrise together.
- Morning, everybody.
- Morning.
Morning...
Thanks for the bungees.
Hey, guys? I think I'm
seeing a volcano erupting.
Where did you see it?
I think she's looking at
the Yucatan Peninsula.
No, it was east of all that.
Oh, whoa! You all just
saw a flash, right?
What the hell is
going on down there?
We've gotta get out of
the Cupola now, guys!
- Get out!
- Get out, now!
- Foster, let's go!
- Foster, move!
Kira, come on!
ISS Crew requesting
information from the ground.
Houston, this is Commander
Barrett. Do you read?
I need to talk to my sister.
I have to know if
the kids are okay.
Houston, this is
Barrett. Can you read me?
What a surprise. The
Internet's out too.
Hey, did anyone see if one
of those flashes
was near California?
That's not a helpful
line of thinking.
What are you, a fucking robot?
I just want to know
if my girls are okay!
Hey, everyone's worried about
people down there, okay?
- Level heads.
- ITS reconfirmed.
- Houston, this is Barrett.
- ITS, no visible damage.
- Copy.
- Houston, can you read?
- This is ISS.
- Hey.
- Is it really the time for that?
- Helps me relax.
Can we get a walkabout?
Someone check system summary.
You okay?
Any news from the United States?
Not yet.
You nervous?
I have a bottle of vodka taped
under the SSRMS control console.
Thank you.
P four and P six solar
array, no visible damage.
Houston respond?
No, no, I got it. It's
just a confirmation tone.
That's normal, right?
You gotta be kidding me.
Anything?
Yeah, nothin'.
It's...
I got nothin'.
So they didn't
say anything else?
That's all they said.
- No other information at all?
- No why, no how.
Take control of things?
What does that even mean?
Well, you're definitely
not there yet.
Well, it's unlikely that
anyone would've been able
to breach and cut
communications like that.
What?
Just lower your voice, okay?
Okay, I'm sorry.
So it's more probable
something's either damaged
or we're dealing with
the residual effects
of an electromagnetic pulse.
We don't know that for sure.
We don't know anything.
The pulse from a warhead
- at high enough altitude...
- No, they didn't,
- they haven't said that.
- We don't know for sure.
Then something,
something like that,
that could have overloaded
our electronics,
and if that's the case,
then hopefully, communications
will be back online
in about 24 hours and then,
we'll be able to, um...
Well, we'll get some answers.
So for now, we wait?
That's exactly right.
Wait while we figure
out what to do
with the limited
information that we have.
Exactly.
I think we're all thinking
the same thing here.
What's that?
If we got orders
from our government
to take control of things...
Hey, uh, we have a problem.
Try rebooting it and
bringing it back up.
We have no internal propulsion.
- Everything's dead or damaged.
- I see that, I see that.
Well, the ISS hasn't used
the thrusters in years.
So what's the deal if
we don't have 'em now?
We intentionally asked the
ground to lower our altitude
for a faster rendezvous
for more supplies.
Wait, like atmospheric drag low?
So we have probably,
like, less than a day?
And then we fall.
We'll schedule an
immediate resupply
and we'll use the additional
boost to lift us again.
For that, you'll have to
communicate with the ground.
We'll take the Soyuz then?
We'll take the Soyuz?
Which of us, Alexey?
Who's gonna take it? Who
gets to be in the life boat?
Taking the Soyuz
without understanding
what's going on
below, it's a suicide.
I don't hear you
suggesting anything!
- Great!
- That's not
- that's not helping.
- We survived a nuclear blast
so that we can fall to death.
This is Science Officer Kira
Foster requesting immediate
reboost from the ground.
If you receive this message
in the next 24 hours,
you can still keep us afloat.
We're counting on you.
There you go, Foster.
Soon as the signal's
back online,
someone down there will receive
that message and send help.
But for now, we're good, right?
Yeah, yeah, we're
good. Everybody good?
- Mm-hmm.
- Da.
You good, man?
No. No, I'm not actually 'cause
I need to reach my girls.
Are you good?
No, Christian, I'm
not, but I'm trying.
We said we're good. So let's be.
- Any luck with the radio?
- Nope.
All I heard was an antenna.
Can you say that again
in English, please?
He says antenna's broken,
needs to be repaired manually.
Great.
Glove connection secure.
Copy.
You okay? You seem a
little grumpy today.
You know, I was reading
last night about Siberia.
Said it means "Beautiful Land."
Is that right? "Land of Beauty"?
I think that's right.
I think I...
I think I can really
get into Siberia.
About time, well done.
- What are you talkin' about?
- I don't know.
Just getting ready
to go out into space.
Yep. Yep, you're gonna be great.
You sure about doing this alone?
- Yep.
- It's a massive
breach of protocol, but
if anyone can do it.
- You ready for this?
- Yeah, let's do 'em.
- How's that?
- Beautiful.
- Helmet secured.
- Yeah.
Let me ask you something.
You don't find it at all odd
that none of them
are volunteering?
- Christian.
- Or, you know, like,
frantically staring
out the window?
I trust Weronika.
I trust all of 'em.
No preparation. This is
a fuckin' death wish.
Gordon?
Gordon?
Gordon, do you copy?
Kira, I want you to
do me a favour, okay?
Okay.
I want you to keep everyone
away from the windows.
Okay.
Listen to my voice.
Stay with my voice.
I want you to look down
and give me a suit pressure
gauge reading, okay?
I need you to recalibrate
and report back with
a target of 4.3.
Lowerin' down.
It's a little high.
Comin' down.
Okay, 4.3.
Okay, okay.
You're free to move
forward at will.
EV1, tether attached.
Slow and steady.
Approaching SSRMS.
Let's just keep talking, okay?
Okay, I can do that.
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- Hey.
- It's, um...
- Yeah, you're feeling it too.
It's awful.
Too much uh...
What's new, huh?
Well, we can't fix it now.
Our uh...
Comfort wasn't their
biggest purpose.
- Yeah, priority.
- What?
"Priority" instead of "purpose."
- Priority.
- Yeah.
Hey, let me know if you need
some ibuprofen or anything.
That stuff usually works
pretty well for me.
Oh, it does? Spasibo.
- Spasibo.
- Yeah, yeah.
I, um
toilet.
You know that word.
Good, good. Very
good, Christian.
Yeah.
Tell me about Weronika.
Uh...
Gordon, when did
you start dating?
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.
That's what you're
gonna go with.
That's what I'm goin' with.
- Okay, fair.
- Passing SSRMS.
Okay, but I will just
say, um, your attempts
to keep the PDA secret are
bordering on ridiculous, and...
Well,
I can't say that physics is
exactly on your side up here.
Can we talk about
something else please?
Okay. Alright.
I didn't know her
'til I came up here.
First week I docked,
we had this karaoke night.
Zero gravity and David Bowie,
there's nothing better.
What? So what did she do,
she woo you with her singing?
No. No, not at all.
I thought my eardrums
were gonna explode.
- Really?
- She was terrible.
She knows it too.
Wanna talk about you?
Do we have to?
'Cause I did see
your file, you know,
seemed like a hard left turn
from a promising biology track
to Marine Corps, which,
unlike our friend
Christian, is something
you haven't brought up.
Well, he's Air Force, that
comes with the territory.
Oh. You raced through
the space program,
and you and I both
know that's not easy.
What's your secret?
I spent seven years
researching organ replacement
with my... my best
friend and my fiancée.
Oh, so there is a
boyfriend in the picture?
Not a boy.
- I'm an idiot.
- Mm-hmm.
But that's okay.
I'll forgive you.
When I was young, my father
died on a waiting list.
And I made it my goal
to find an easier way
to manufacture
what people needed.
Wow. So I'm sorry.
No, no, it's okay. I'm good.
I mean, our research only worked
in theory, and every attempt
at practice had failed because
there was too much weight
on the cells.
But up here, you don't
have that problem?
Nice one.
But what about them?
Please tell me this
story has a happy ending.
Uh... not for me.
Not for you. What happened?
She cheated.
They found each other one night
and every night
after that, it seems.
Honestly, it just
isn't my strong suit.
Nah, you've just been
trusting the wrong people.
Hmm.
I'm...
It's just better to go it alone.
It's much easier that way.
I've got my work
and... that's enough.
I don't know what to say.
Look, if we could get
our shit together,
it might be good to be stuck
with this weird-ass family
for a while.
We got you, doc. He'll
never get rid of us.
Here we go.
It's gettin' a little quiet
there for a second, huh?
Let's...
Gordon?
Gordon, come in.
Gordon, do you read me?
Do you have him?
Do you have Gordon?
- No. What's up?
- My comms are dead.
He's not responding.
Gordon, do you read?
- Well, just keep tryin'.
- What?
- What happened?
- My comms are out.
- Where's Alexey?
- Completely out,
- there's nothing.
- Alright, keep at it, okay?
Gordon, do you copy?
Do you read me?
Gordon, do you read me?
Closing in on the antenna.
I can see it from here.
Kira? Kira, do you read?
Foster, do you read?
Foster, do you read me?
Kira, if you can read me,
now would be the time for
some words of encouragement.
Okay, okay.
Okay, you got this.
Gordon? Gordon, do you read?
Try ours.
Gordon? Gordon, come in.
Is someone on the arm?
I don't need the arm.
Kira, do you copy? I
don't need the arm.
Where is it? Where is it?
I'm coming up on the
antenna. It looks...
It looks completely fine.
The antenna's fine, Kira.
Kira, the antenna's fine.
Kira! Kira, do you read?
He lied!
Is someone on the arm? Kira, I
don't need the arm right now.
Kira, do you read?
Kira, I don't need
the fucking arm!
Foster, what channel are you
on? Foster, do you read...
Let me try.
Hey, Gordon, you hear me?
Gordon, I need you to respond.
- Anything, Christian?
- Nope, nothing.
Gordon, you hear me? Gordon,
I need you to respond.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
Where are you, Gordon?
Where is he?
- Where?
- Where?
I'm not...
Damn it.
- There.
- That's starboard.
It looks like he's moving
starboard. Check that portal.
What the hell
happened out there?
Honestly, I've got no idea.
He was with me and
then he wasn't.
- Gordon, can you hear me?
- We need a clearer visual.
Check every window.
- Gordon?
- I can't see him.
- Can you?
- I got nothing port side.
- Anything, Christian?
- Here.
Here, here! Hey, I see him!
- I got him, down here!
- Go, go, go, come on, Nika!
Gordon! Gordon,
please say something.
- Gordon, please?
- Gordon, come in.
- Anything, say something.
- Talk to us, pal.
Gordon? Was he still
tethered? Let's find out.
- Let's go!
- Come on!
Kira, please. We have to talk.
Look, I... I have
to go out there.
- I have to get...
- No.
No. It's no less than
what he would do.
- He is dead, Kira.
- He is not dead!
We don't know that! I
have to go out there.
Even if there's the
smallest chance,
or at least, we need to find
out what actually happened.
- He is dead.
- He would do it for us.
- You know he would.
- He's dead, Kira,
and if you leave me
here alone with them,
I will be too.
What...
What happened? Lyosha?
Kolya?
You wouldn't have
wanted to know.
I don't understand.
I didn't know...
Nicholai promised.
Before the radios failed...
We received orders
from the ground.
There's a war between
us and the Americans.
We have been told...
We have been told
to take the ISS.
At all costs.
I replaced it with a dummy wire.
What?
No one will know.
No...
I didn't know what
Nicholai was going to do.
Tell her.
No, Lyosha.
Tell her!
Nicholai!
It was just supposed to cut
off their communication.
Look at me.
You can't have thought...
I'm sorry.
I don't want your sorry.
Weronika, they were
going to do it to us.
We have to assume this.
You're a monster, Nicholai.
Yeah, I'm a monster...
I understand why you'd say that.
Sorry you don't want to hear that
right now, but it's the truth.
You're my friend.
He's not dead.
He's not dead.
Lyosha, he's not dead!
If his suit held up, then his life support
should keep him alive until it fails!
Lyosha, please!
If we don't move quickly,
he's going to be drowning out
there for the next eight hours!
We need to try.
I'm telling the Americans.
If you won't help me, they will.
He's gone.
There was no one on
the tether, was there?
He must have undone
it himself...
We don't have eyes on
him anymore, either.
Nika...
It's over.
There are two other Americans
on board, you son of a bitch!
Do you intend to
murder them too?
No one deserves what
you did to Gordon.
No one.
Nika?
What are you saying? Have
you thought about that?
Well, we know what
Courtney was told, right?
So that means we have to assume
that the Russians got
the same orders as us
and they just struck first.
Struck first?
Where the hell do you
think you are right now?
Gordy is gone!
I don't know if you
have noticed that,
but he is fucking gone!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...
We can agree that we're
playing a man down here, right?
That means that we need
to trust each other.
I'm all you have, and
you're all I have,
and I don't know about you,
but I wanna fucking
survive this thing.
But what if it was an accident?
- Oh, come on.
- Can we at least
- consider that it...
- Give me a break.
Foster, you trained to
be up here too, right?
- Yes, I did!
- You know the safety
- protocols that are in place.
- I do and I know you sound
resigned to believing the worst
of them, and I'm not there yet.
I'm not saying it
was an accident,
but you know them
better than I do.
You've worked with
them, lived with them.
Were they really the type
of people who would've
killed Gordon?
I don't know,
but I know that we
don't have the time
to assume that
they wouldn't have.
Okay, so if they'd got the
same orders that we did
and if they actually
killed him...
What do you suggest we do now?
Well, for starters,
I vote that we don't believe
a single thing they say.
Kira.
I need to talk to you.
To both of us, right?
To Kira.
Kira?
Nika, I'm so sorry about Gordon.
- Oh!
- If there's anything
- that I can do...
- I need your help
and I need you to
keep it a secret.
- Why?
- Because you're new
and I know I can't
trust anyone else now.
So... you are all I have.
I don't know what
to say to that.
Well, maybe in a few hours,
we'll be safe and sound
or maybe we'll be
falling out of the sky.
But we have work to do before
either of those things happen
and we don't have
time for hesitation.
Okay. What do you need?
Your key. In exchange,
I'll give you mine.
I don't want your key.
What do you need mine for?
I want to open an
American lock box.
- Which one?
- Does it matter?
It depends.
It's gone. I lost it.
- You lost it?
- I lost it.
- It, it...
- You lost it?
It's gone! I lost it!
I don't have the
key! I'm not lying!
I lost it! It's not here!
Did the Americans give
you orders to kill us?
I don't know
anything about that.
You know, you're not the
only bio engineer on board.
- Alexey?
- Do you know
what he's working with?
Advanced compounds of Prussian
blue and potassium iodine,
a treatment for
radiation sickness.
With what seems to be
going on down there,
I think it's the most valuable
thing we have on board,
much more than the five of us.
Maybe that's why
we're in this mess.
Right now, it's a treatment.
But if there truly
is a war down there,
whoever has the treatment
gets to decide who gets saved.
I don't know what
you want me to do.
They didn't tell us anything.
- You sure?
- Gordon never got through.
I'm positive.
Okay.
They told us
they told us to take the ISS,
by any means necessary.
We received the same orders.
So, Gordon...
- They...
- Yes.
I never thought Nicholai
and Alexey were capable
of doing something so severe,
but now, we both know different.
That means they
can do worse too.
Well, if that's true, then
I'm... I'm gonna help you.
I was praying you
would say that.
I will create a distraction.
That's why I need your key.
You go to your lab. Use my
key on Alexey's lock box.
He keeps his notes inside
it. He'll need them.
But more important are the
samples stored in Node 0.
The ones you're looking
for have red labels.
Take it with you in the
Soyuz. You are leaving.
- Wait, what?
- You're leaving.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Take the samples back
to Earth on the Soyuz.
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes.
- Nika, I can't do that.
- Please, please?
Kira, go! It has to be you.
Why? Why does it have to be me?
Because you just
told me the truth,
which means you trust me.
So I trust you.
Nika, I cannot do
this without guidance.
Kira, you know more
than you think you do.
No, no. If I don't have
guidance from the ground,
it doesn't matter.
I won't make it.
Well, up here, you...
We're still falling, Kira.
At least, this way, you have a
chance of saving some people.
Please, Kira. Please, Kira, go!
This is the only chance
to make all of it,
to make any of this worth it.
But what about the rest of you?
We can still figure it out.
Your job is more important
now. This will save lives.
Do you understand
what you need to do?
- Yes.
- Repeat it.
Lock box in Node 0, red labels.
Go fast.
What are you doing?
Don't you get it?
We're scientists.
We're not dogs.
But if it's this easy to forget
what's the difference?
Weronika...
That's pure oxygen
in those vents.
If you activate that, you'll
torch the whole station.
Lyosha, get in here!
I understand it's
hard for you now.
I know what you're
going through.
But we can still talk
about this, can't we?
Listen to me...
Brother...
Nika...
Don't do this.
You don't know what I want.
Gordon knew
now I know...
Stay away!
- You're going to get us all killed!
- Stay away!
Come on, faster! Come on!
What are you doing?
Christian...
I need your help and
I don't have time
- to explain everything.
- Okay, what?
There's a cure in Node 0.
- It's for radiation sickness.
- I'd love to help you, but...
I need to find it and I need
your help as fast as you can.
You don't understand.
Just need to...
Kira, there is no Node 0.
- She lied.
- Who?
Weronika, she lied. She
played me. We gotta go now.
We have to find
her now! Come on!
Hey.
Listen to me.
Why should I?
The important thing is
that we stick together.
Talk to me about your sister.
Her children...
Maxim,
and Elena.
Don't do this.
Think about them.
I am doing this for them.
Nika...
Stay away!
I understand if I ended
our friendship today.
But I don't believe you
want to hurt anyone.
We can still resolve
things peacefully.
- Lyosha.
- Nika.
You were always a good friend.
But I don't believe any of that.
Nika...
Lyosha, I'm so sorry...
She was gonna blow up the
station! We could have died!
- You all saw that?
- Get out.
- I just saved you!
- Just hold her!
We need to go,
okay? We gotta go!
- Yes, yes!
- Nika!
Nika!
Come on! Wake up!
Nika, wake up! Wake up!
Lyosha, get her out of here!
We have to get her out of here!
We need to stay close because
they're gonna need us.
Christian, are you
here listening to me?
- Where are we going?
- Leonardo.
- Leonardo?
- Garbage and storage.
It's our best bet to hide until
the radios come back online.
- Gonna be about nine hours.
- No, no, no, no.
Christian.
Look, I know that what
you're saying is true,
but there's still a chance
that we could save her, okay?
- We have to try.
- No, no, no.
Listen to me, listen to
me. She's not gonna...
- She's not gonna make it.
- We don't know that yet.
No, I do because I felt the back
of her skull cave in, okay?
And then, there was, um...
There was something
about it and, um,
I could just tell that...
And she was being crazy,
right? You saw that?
- No, I, I...
- And she lied to you.
Why else would she have
wanted your keys so badly
if she didn't want to
destroy the station?
- She said...
- That's what she asked for,
- wasn't it?
- She said she was just going
to create a distraction.
A distraction for
you to do what?
Look, Kira, if you wanna
be alone in all this,
I need to know, okay?
Because I want to get home
and I wanna see my girls.
I wanna live.
So I just... I need you to
stay here with me, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
I'm finishing this.
What does that mean?
You know what it means.
You're not a murderer.
Don't be an idiot.
I'm trying to save lives here.
These people killed our friend.
No...
We killed our friend.
You know Lyosha...
There's a word for that.
What?
Duty.
You
are a good son of your country.
A son of your people.
A good son.
You're my brother.
Remember that.
Nicholai?
Nicholai!
Gordon.
Gordon?
Gordon.
Kira!
Gordon.
No...
Come on, come on!
Gordon.
Found anyone?
What do you think?
Is there anybody here?
Alexey just informed me
that Weronika is alive.
We were able to stop
the bleeding and, uh,
she's asleep in
her sleeping pod.
When she gets better,
we should all get together
and then think about how we
can resolve this peacefully.
Nicholai.
It's a nasty concussion,
but it's, uh,
it's nothing we cannot control.
So, uh
what do you say?
Brother.
Stop.
Nyet. Nyet!
Hey, no!
Go!
No, no!
Hey!
Gordon! Jesus!
Where is she? Where is Weronika?
Where's Weronika?!
Where's Weronika?!
She's gone.
Gordon.
Just tell me where she is.
Just fucking tell me where she
is. Just tell me where she is.
- Look at me.
- Where is she?!
- Gordon!
- Weronika?
Look at me! Look at me!
We can't! We have
to do something!
Don't you do that!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, Gordon!
Gordon!
Stop!
No!
- We're coming, we're coming.
- Please, come on!
As fast as you can,
Christian. As fast as you can!
Okay!
- Come on!
- Fuck!
No, no! No!
Node 0.
Oh, my God!
She wasn't lying.
Christian! Christian,
there is a Node 0!
Why didn't you
tell me? Christian?
Oh, my God.
A Soyuz suit!
You're leaving without us.
No.
Oh, my God!
Everything okay?
Yeah, just... just a headache.
Yeah.
You know, I was thinking...
What happened up here is
nothing short of tragic,
don't get me wrong,
but...
I wonder if there isn't a
silver lining in all this.
I mean, think about it.
We're gonna be heroes
when we get back home.
Or did you want to
be the only one?
So you think we'll make it home?
Depends on if you leave
some room in the Soyuz
for us this time.
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?
You would be the
hero with the cure
while the rest of us
fall out of the sky.
That Weronika's idea,
leaving me here?
"No man left behind" mean
anything to you, Kira?
- What are you talk...
- Hey.
It's okay. No hard feelings.
You know, for what it's worth,
I'm glad that you're still here.
Christian, what you makin'?
Sandwich.
I'm not really hungry,
but I just realized I haven't
eaten in, like, a day, so...
Do you want one?
Yeah. I'll make it myself.
Do you mind?
Oh, uh, there's
some plastic knives
in that bag right there.
That one'll do just fine.
I'm sorry.
My head's all over
the place today.
Hey, uh, Alexey.
Would you mind giving Dr. Foster
and me a moment in private?
There's something she
feels she needs to tell me.
No offense.
Da, da.
The important thing
is that we stick together.
The important things
is that we stick together.
Alexey, a moment please.
I froze the life support,
but I can fix it.
I know how to
reverse the process.
So do I.
Christian!
Sorry.
When I was asleep
you put this here for them.
Good to have something
to hold onto.
Connect 3-1 with
transmission control,
Houston standing by to provide
guidance from the ground.
Who is on board the Soyuz?
Please respond.
Please provide the names
of all crew on
board immediately.
We are standing by to assist
any Americans on board.
Do you copy?
Kira.
Where are we going?
I don't know.
