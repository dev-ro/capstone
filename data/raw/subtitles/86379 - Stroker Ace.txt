Hey, Stroker, let's rest.
I'm tired.
Sure, Doc. Want some gum?
I guess so.
Howdy, boys!
Hi, dad. Hi, Mr. Seegle.
Y'all have
a little problem there.
Yeah. Could you give us a lift?
Sure enough. Get in.
What happened to your bike, son?
Ace tried to jump the gully.
You remember Ace, don't you, dad?
Ain't you that kid that locked
that lady schoolteacher
in the outhouse?
Yes, sir.
And then turned it over?
Yes, sir.
Hey, boy, I need my mirror, now.
Dad runs shine.
Here comes Seegle.
I've been waitin' to
nab him for a long time.
He's got a load of shine.
Hold on.
I'm going to have to stand on it.
Ride!

Hey, Stroker,
your hair looks real nice.
Yeah, I know.
Lugs, lean out further.
I'm going to make a turn.
The birthplace of speed...
The Daytona international
speedway in Florida.
In a few moments,
the drivers will battle
at battle than 200 miles an hour
for upward of a million dollars.
He's only got three wheels!
Next, from Ashland, Ohio,
and the J.D. Stacy-PAK,
number two... buick Tim Richmond!
And driving out of
Ellerbe, north Carolina,
in the Wyman-Gordon express...
Benny Parsons!
On the next row, inside,
in the 7-Eleven skoal bandit
from Taylorsville, north Carolina,
here's Harry Gant!
Look out!
From Grosse Pointe, Michigan,
driving the four star whiskey entry,
Aubrey James!
On the pole, race fans,
with the fastest qualifying effort
here he is... three-time
NASCAR driving champion...
A guy, you can see,
who makes a dynamic entrance,
ladies and gentlemen...
Stroker Ace!
Hi, Stroker.
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?
I got them up. You entertain them.
Well, you've done it again.
How's it going?
Well...
Hi.
Look. Your tail's bent.
Kind of unique?
Same old shit, Stroker.
I know you?
Yeah, you know me.
Nice to see you again.
Hello. I love your patches.
In Talladega, you left me
to go get a loaf a bread.
Got to maintain my energy.
Hi.
Hi.
I have to keep up my...
After I win the race today,
let's get together for
a little kick-the-can.
Hey, Stroker, we got a race to run.
Later.
It won't be like last year.
I'll kick his tail.
You don't have to be on
NASCAR 50 years to win.
Aubrey, forget about Stroker Ace.
Race the pavement.
You're obsessed with him.
You bet I am!
Didn't I just say that?
Check that out.
I'll eat his lunch.
OK, I'm ready.
You're nothing but trouble.
You think the world owes you a living.
Yes, sir, Mr. Coty.
Catty!
Whatever.
It ain't gonna be like last year.
But Stroker and I got
to talk about the race.
All right,
But you work for me, see?
I am your boss! B-o-s-s!
Get your hand off the car.
Now, you go on out there,
and you win one for big "z" oil!
We're all pulling for you, Stroker boy!
What a prince.
You have a good race.
Harry Gant!
Here comes chicken pit.
Gonna win?
I'll let you know about 5:00.
Ready for Clyde Torkle's
name on your car?
I'll let you know.
Hey, junior, give me a Jack!
Ready with the air bottle?
Stroker Ace, how you doing, boy?
Not now, Clyde.
I can't talk but just a minute.
Remember my chauffeur Arnold?
Talk to him.
Yeah, let's talk.
I hear you're having sponsor trouble.
No, I'm not having sponsor trouble.
Yes, you are, too.
You should drive a Clyde Torkle
chicken pit special?
We'd be partners.
Me drive for you?
You want me to drive for you?
I couldn't!
Why not?
'Cause everybody loves me.
Everybody hates you.
I'm good-lookin'.
You're not that bad-lookin'.
My money looks good.
Don't lean on the car.
Nobody touches the car.
Not ever... Except you.
You can touch it anytime you want.
Lugs Harvey!
Best mechanic in America.
And you're the best, too.
Best in the NASCAR. Yes, you are, too!
You either crash or win.
I like that.
Petty!
Come on, Arnold.
See you guys.
Go blow their doors off, Stroker.
Can't you come up with
anything more original?
Well, that's what we always say.
I'll think about it.
Gentlemen, start your engines!
Well, the field begins
to roll down pit row,
and we're ready to go racing.
Go, ruddy!
The pace car drops down onto pit row.
Harold Kinder standing by,
holding them down as the green
is set to be unveiled.
Go, Stroker! Go!
Go!
Hammer down, pistol cocked,
as these gladiators work
out of turn number two,
moving down the back straightaway.
120,000 fried-chicken junkies,
and god knows how many
watchin' on television.
Kind of makes you
want to cry, doesn't it?
Arnold!
Oh, yeah. Whatever you say.
Come on, Arnold. Excuse me, honey.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Mr. Torkle, the race just started.
Darlin', when my own car
is on that track,
I'll stay the race.
I can use my time better
gettin' to know my new employee...
Go get some dinner...
Get ourselves some champagne.
I don't drink..
You don't?
No.
I'm a Sunday school teacher.
That was on my resume.
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course.
Of course.
Lugs, who's driving number 10?
You ought to know.
That's Aubrey James.
He's been trying
to kill you for years.
I already got blisters on my hands.
To drive this thing 500 more miles,
I'd have to be king Kong.
It shouldn't be any problem.
You both got the same IQ.
Very funny!
Aubrey James,
at the bottom of the racetrack,
cuts into Harry Gant's automobile!
Stroker Ace to the outside,
spinning wildly!
There's five, six, seven automobiles,
slipping, sliding...
Into the wall!
He shortened that automobile
about 1 1/2 feet!
Stroker Ace in a major altercation
with Aubrey James and Harry Gant...
A send-tow vacation
down in turn number one!
I'm sure all of you Stroker Ace fans
are wondering just how Stroker is.
We'll get you a report
on he and the other drivers
from down in turn one.
Who set up the car, drug addicts?
You just lost it.
I didn't lose it! How do I look?
Why?
TV cameras.
An early pedestrian here in the 500,
the well-known Stroker Ace.
What happened?
One of the tires equalized,
and shoved me into the wall.
You were fighting
the automobile from the beginning.
Not true. When Lugs sets up a car,
your mother could drive it.
Lugs Harvey, mechanic
for Stroker Ace, how about it?
If Stroker can't drive a car,
nobody can.
That's the story
from the veteran Stroker Ace
and his venerable chief
mechanic Lugs Harvey.
Just once, I wish you would
tell us the real story.
You wreck your race car,
your rental car, your hotel room.
Nobody's perfect.
Watch where you're goin'!
This car's in my name.
Yes, Mr. Coty.
Catty!
You this far way, boy!
Just this far!
You want to lose big "z" oil,
stroke, old boy?
No, sir.
I'll go get my key,
and then I'll drive you to your room.
Well, get my key, too.
Yes, sir.
Now, that's more like it.
Mr. Ace finally understands
that this is a business.
And in a business,
you don't Act like a maniac.
It's nice meetin' you, Mr. Coty.
Catty!
Oh, my goodness!
I'll get you!
You'll never ride again!
Get me out!
You'll get it!
I'll get you, you son...
Why did you have to fill
up his car with cement?
Because a man's got to do
what he's got to do.
We don't even have a sponsor,
the season's already started.
You don't ever think of
anybody but yourself.
Hold it.
See that guy over there?
He's got my exact same shirt on.
I ought to go back
in the room and change.
We're gonna run out
of sponsors someday.
I wonder what he paid for that.
OK, who's gonna buy the winner a drink?
OK, I'll have two beers.
You know that number 10
you asked about...
Aubrey James... Today's winner?
There he is.

Stroker Ace!
You gonna be so glad I called you.
Anytime I see Clyde Torkle,
I get worried.
I can handle Clyde.
He's putty in my hands.
Hello, Clyde.
Is that god's own race car,
or what is it?
What is it?
I got my name up there!
Yep.
What's it look like?
This car would be
disqualified in two seconds flat.
Why?
Your engine's set too far back.
You got an oversized carburetor.
Nitrous oxide is an automatic
six-month suspension.
This ain't a Bible class.
Everybody cheats.
What kind of contract?
Five years.
Four. Two. A year.
The contract will read three years.
You like the car?
I like the car, not him.
He don't like you.
He's supposed to like the car, not me.
Here's your contract.
It's bigger than
my high school yearbook.
You went to high school?
One year.
Got a pen?
Ain't you gonna read it?
Of course I am!
You think I'm stupid?
Hey, there's no writin' on this paper.
It's upside down.
You just want to get through all this.
I got to read it!
Oh, shoot!
I forgot to tell you
about the uniforms.
We're gonna have red ones
and some black ones.
The red ones have black trim.
The black will be mostly black.
Are they tailored?
They'll be real tight-fittin'.
You couldn't wear one, could you?
I wouldn't want to wear one...
Sign there.
All black?
A little white on some.
Shoot! I bet I look good in that.
Women will drop like flies.
And driving out of waycross, Georgia,
in a Clyde Torkle chicken pit special,
here's Stroker Ace...
The fastest chicken in the south!
Say what?
It's on your car.
Bawk!
Bawk bawk bawk!
Fastest chicken in the south.
Fastest chicken in the south.
Fastest chicken in the south.
I've got "fastest chicken
in the south" on my car.
That guy clucked at me.
Whup him!
I'm not gonna have that on my car.
Yes, you are.
It's in your contract.
Arnold.
Here you go.
Page 417, paragraph "A,"
subparagraph "B,"

Gentlemen, start your engines!
I don't think he's coming down.
What room's he in, Lugs?
308.
Thanks, Lugs. 308, right?
I'll see you later, hon.
Well, hello.
Hey.
How are you, ma'am?
I don't know.
How am I?
I'm not one of the drivers.
I'm just a mechanic.
I like mechanics.
You do?
They know how to tinker
with things for hours...
Make them go fast.
Go away, Lugs!
Hi!
Saw you when your dress went pffft!
I hope you're here to talk business,
'cause he's all tuckered out.
See how the tail's bent? Unique?
Got pictures for me to sign?
Come on in.
I'm going to get into
somethin' comfortable.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm Pembrook Feeney.
Who?
Pembrook Feeney,
Clyde Torkle's executive assistant.
Who?
Clyde Torkle.
Clyde Torkle's executive assistant
with responsibilities
overseeing all chicken pit
advertising and public relations...
Public relations?
Including what we call
our collateral racing thrust.
What's that?
That's you.
Collateral what?
Thrust.
I think I like that.
As I was saying...
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
Is that your real voice?
You don't like it?
It's weird in a nice way.
I think we should
get started right away.
We?
We have two objectives.
We do?
Is this one of them?
No. Our first objective
is to expose you
to our company's history.
The other is to apprise you
of our new advertising campaign.
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
I just spent all night
having to deal with
this very strange person...
Howdy, ma'am.
Howdy, ma'am.
This is Lugs Harvey.
Pembrook Feeney,
How do you do?
Pembrook Feeney.
That's her real voice, too.
Boy, she sure is pretty.
Lugs Harvey is my chief mechanic.
You'll be interested in this.
I was about to show Stroker
our gross volume chart.
Now, as you can see,
our sales have steadily
increased since 1967.
At one point,
our sales matched the colonel's...
Until sympathy purchasing broke out
following his death.
Well, that's very interesting, miss...
Feeney.
Pembrook.
Whatever. I'm sure you're
very good at your job.
Thank you.
See, I ain't gonna do
but two personal appearances this year.
I might do one commercial
if it's real classy.
And I want "fastest chicken
in the south" off my car.
I'm sorry. That's quite impossible.
You have a whole schedule
of personal appearances.
I'll travel with you to
arranged everything.
Travel with me?
Excuse me.
Well, then, we'll be
sharing a room, right?
No. We couldn't do that.
We're not married.
What a little kidder!
What's that got to do with it?
I couldn't share a room with
a man I'm not married to.
And you never beer married?
No.
That makes you a...
A virgin.
Yes. Sure, I am. I'm single.
Well, I think that's nice.

Can I ask you a question?
OK. You can ask me anything.
Are you sure you've

Maybe there was somebody you forgot.

How could you ask her

There's nobody here!
People are waiting to buy some chicken.
Boy, you are really
packing them in, Stroker.
Stroker!
Stroker! Rah rah rah!
This is the big time, boy.
Show a little excitement.
Yay! Yay!
Very good! Real good!
Even word of mouth
won't help this joint.
Ain't he something? Yay!
This is the 12th chicken pit
we've opened this week.
Only 2 years, 10 months, and 3
days to go on your contract.
Don't be putting
that stuff on my mouth.
Big smile now!
Is he smiling?
I'm smiling.
Come on! Look.
Look a little more like a race driver.
This is Stroker Ace,
Clyde Torkle's new driver
in the chicken pit special,
the fastest chicken in the south.
Could you emphasize the word chicken?
Chicken.
This is Stroker Ace,
Clyde Torkle's new driver
in the chicken pit special,
the fastest chicken in the south.
Another race car driver.
Why can't they find one with a voice?
Fastest chicken in the south.
That's it. That's what I want.
I could sing it for you.
Thank you, Mr. Ace.
Stroker.
Mr. Stroker, thank you.
That lawyer says you got
to do what Clyde wants,
or you can't race for three whole years.
Not here, not Europe, not even in Italy.
You sure that's exactly
what that lawyer said?
Let's get another lawyer.
Lugs, what day is it?
Three chicken pits past Sunday.
Our special guest is Stroker Ace,
Three-time NASCAR champion
and leading contender for
this year's championship.
Ready on camera! Let's shoot this.
Cale, how you runnin'?
I'd be doin' a lot better without him.
I thought you trained a crew chief.
Hang in there.
Sum up in a few well-chosen words
the essence of a NASCAR driver.
Go down to the end of the straightaway
and turn left.
Unless you're number 10.
Then you turn right.
Who's number 10?
Who is number 10?
Number 10 is Aubrey James.
This is my chief mechanic.
Lugs Harvey.
All right.
Stroker, what does a chief mechanic do?
Well...
He takes care of the car
and sees that everything is right.
But I'm also a singer.
Everybody around the pits
says I sing real good.

Come on!
I'll hold on to it.
Give the girl a kiss!

These people sell chicken for us!
Who's next?
That no-class son of a bitch
doesn't know who he's dealing with.
Four different lawyers
said the same thing.
Clyde Torkle's got to fire you.
Oh, yeah?
You know... I have
a certain amount of dignity
and a pretty good self-image.
I know what I am.
I'm a race car driver.
I ain't no goddamn chicken.
Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!
I'm Stroker Ace.
The only thing I like
better than winning a race
is to stuff Torkle chicken in my face.
It's not very dignified, is it?
No, but he looks real nice
in his chicken outfit.
Try harder. We could do better.
What do you say?
No.
You have to.
It's in your contract.
I don't give a Turkey.
I did some dumb things in my life,
but this is the dumbest!
I know It's in my contract
that I got to sell chicken.
I'm going to sell it so hard
he'll choke to death on it!
You drive.
Look at this.
Must be some new kind of cult.
We've seen promotions come and go
in NASCAR grand national racing,
but Mr. Clyde Torkle
may have laid the ultimate egg
with this one...
Blatant commercialism.
Fans of the veteran three-time
NASCAR grand national champion
are not very enthusiastic
about what they're seeing.
There you see Stroker Ace
coming down before
this tremendous congregation,
the audience not appreciating a bit
the fact that Clyde Torkle
has turned one of the great
heroes of American motor sport
into a farce.
Man, that is funny.
And here, perhaps,
the final insult to racing fans...
The new thunderbird of Stroker Ace
outfitted as a plucked chicken.
We'll never see Torkle's
name on my car again!
Poor, pitiful...!
Whoever thought of this...
I love it.
Keep it up.
Miss Pembrook, you're not only a Saint,
you a smart woman.
I'm gonna to give you a raise.
Our beautiful grand marshal
will commence this event.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
Can you drive like that?
When a dumb hick like Stroker
pulls a stunt like that,
make out like he did you a favor.
He won't never do it again.
Looks like it didn't work.
We sure went to a lot
of trouble for nothing.
This is embarrassing.
What will we do now? Got more ideas?
Put your devious mind to work.
We'll get out
of this damn contract!
Gum!
Here at the world's
fastest motor speedway
at Talladega, Alabama.
Get ready for the first pit stop.
Through the tri-oval come the field
down for the start.
Into the back straightaway
for the first time,
and they go over 200 miles per hour
down that 4,000-foot backstretch.
Pffft! Pffft!
Shoot!
Fastest chicken in the south!
They come out of turn four,
headed back through the tri-oval
for the first time.
Stroker Ace mixing it up.
Caution is on the speedway
early in the going.
Ever think about trying to lead?
We could use a lap!
You think it's easy
driving with chicken feet?
Here! Take the other one.
Hurry up!
Once again underway.
Lugs!
Yeah?
Check the pit!
See if any tools are missing.
Why?
I think there's something
in the engine.
That engine's perfect.
You've got my word on it.
God damn!
Shoot!
Oh, shoot.
It's all over for Stroker Ace.
Stroker hand-grenaded an engine
in turn two.
The caution is up for the second time
in this Talladega 500.
Lugs!
Yeah?
About your word...
It ain't worth...
The whole thing's a trick.
What is?
It's a Clyde Torkle chicken pit trick
to get me to go around cutting ribbons.
You mean Pembrook Feeney?
Of course! No woman looks like that
and is a...
What do you call that?
Virgin.
Right. You buy that?
There are some nice women
in this world.
Pembrook Feeney is a god-fearing woman.
I'm proud and honored to know her.
If you had a Ferrari,
would you just leave it in the garage?
If you had wild Turkey,
would you never drink it?
Meeting her is the healthiest thing
that ever happened to you.
Down the inside
goes Aubrey James, number 10.
On the outside, Stroker Ace.
7-Eleven car inside,
wall on the outside.
If Aubrey James can contain Ace,
he's going to come home the winner!
Aubrey James takes the checkered flag
in the Michigan 400,
but not the appreciation
of the 75,000 in attendance.
Perhaps the angriest is Stroker Ace.
Should have given you a taller gear.
Wasn't your fault.
He beat you.
He did it with style.
Guys, what's so bad about second?
Come in.
Hello.
Hi.
They slide out.
I knew that.
Well...
How is everything at
the chicken factory?
Just great.
Mr. Torkle will be in later,
if you want to speak with him.
Rather not.
Where's Lugs?
Lugs?
Lugs is dead.
What?
Just kidding.
I like to kid. Girls seem to like it.
What do they know?
My sister always said
I had a great sense of humor.
If she's like you,
I'll be in double trouble.
She's dead.
I'm s...
You're kidding like me?
No. She was run over by
a tractor-trailer truck.
I'm sorry.
Don't get upset.
That was a long time ago.
Let's go out to dinner
so we can kid some more.
No. Let's stay here and drink.
I don't drink.
I knew that.
Lugs told me that.
That's why I ordered
nonalcoholic champagne.
Looks and tastes like the real thing,
right down to the phony label.
I've never heard of that.
You have to order it special...
All the way from... New Hampshire.
I'll be darned.
I'll be darned, too. Drink up.
That was good.
Good. Have some more.
There.
Shall we go out on the balcony?
Why?
Enjoy the view?
OK. What about dinner?
Room service.
Why?
Better food.
I want to talk to you about...
Some chicken things.
I forgot my charts.
Oh, darn.
It smells so good, like after a rain.
That would be your magnolia.
Jasmine.
Whatever.
Stroker.
Why do men race?
What?
Why race? Why do you do it?
I don't know.
But you must.
Well, it's...
Kind of hard to explain.
Try.
It's more like a feeling
you get, you know?
When did you first feel it?
Feel what?
The feeling.
I was a young kid.
I used to run around
with this guy named Doc.
We had a bike...
You had a bicycle!
Yeah.
Somehow I think that's very sweet
that you had a bicycle.
You do?
I do.
I had a whole bunch.
You did?
What y'all doin'?
Hi, Lugs!
How was your flight?
I drove.
You shouldn't have driven
down here by yourself.
What are you doing here?
Just seeing what's going on.
I'll get it.
I told her about my bicycle.
Your what?
My bicycle! It was working, too.
Look, Lugs!
Golly!
That's beautiful!
You got enough there for three!
It's lucky I came by.
It sure is!
Stroker, this has your name on it.
Here we come!
What's wrong, James?
Not handling too well
in the turns, Kyle.
James, always blaming the equipment.
I ain't falling off this time.
I'll beat you in that inside turn.
Kyle, you ready?
I'm ready.
Stand on it!
Yaaah!
We got 'em by a mile, Ricky!
Stroker, 10.
The name's Aubrey James!
Bye-bye!
No!
Come on. Let's go.
Glug! Glug!
That-away!
I'm Stroker Ace.
The only thing I like better
than winning a race
is to stuff Torkle chicken in my face.
Look at that chicken!
That's a real chicken in a human suit!
Come down here, chicken.
Come on down!
Come on!
I'm sorry.
I didn't think it would be like this.
It's OK. I signed the contract.
Sure did.
But everything's
going to be all right, hon.
I should talk to Mr. Torkle.
It's going to be fine.
OK.
Excuse me.
Hey, kitty, goin' to the sandbox?
♪ It's 6:05 A.M.
on Sunday mornin'... ♪
Cluck for us, Ace.
You can do that good.
Come on, damn it!
We want to hear a cluck.
Who gives a cluck?
Why don't you cluck for him, Stroker?
He does it good.
You want me to stand up
and cluck for 'em?
Of course.
Cluckin' is real hard to do.
You got to get
your head back like this.
It starts in your diaphragm.
It comes up through your esophagus
and goes right through the larynx...
The Adam's apple.
You got to get your chin way up there.
That's it.

Yeah. They're really lookin' up.

10.
Whatever.
Yeah?
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,
but it's very important.
I sure hope it's important,
you comin' up here this time of night.
Things we have Stroker doing
are very embarrassing.
What kind of things is that?
Why does he have to
wear a chicken suit?
Because I want him to.
Mr. Torkle,
Can't we release him from his contract?
With all the money he's makin' me?
What's the matter?
You gone sweet on him?
No. No. I do like him, of course.
You like him?
Yes. But professionally speaking,
I think we should reevaluate
the whole situation.
Professionally?
Yes. I'm speaking
as a professional businesswoman.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I guess you ain't
as professionally religious
as you used to be
before going on the road
with the Stroker.
What?
Honey, what I mean is,
we can do better for you
than some hayseed racetrack driver.
I can make life a bed
of roses for you, honey-pie.
Mr. Torkle, stop that!
I ain't started real good yet.
Don't you do this.
Jumped right into the bed!
I just knew it would
end up with us like this.
Now stop this.
Come on, let's have fun!
What do you say?
I quit!
Is your race ready, Charlie?
She's ready.
Take the day off.
I fired that Feeney woman.
I quit!
You're fired.
What are you doin' down there?
She's workin' for me.
No, she's not. This is my car.
Better check the contract.
I can have anybody I want
in the pit crew.
OK.
She tell you what happened between us?
No.
It's not true.
What happened?
I fired her, that's all.
But I ain't firin' you.
We'll be together forever.
Be back at that hotel at 6:00 sharp.
What did happen between you two?
He just made me mad,
so I kicked him in the scrotum.
"Scrotum"?
What's a "scrotum"?
I don't know..
I think I'll find out.
What's a...?
You ought not have to make
appearances after 6:00.
That's more than a 12-hour day.
Ain't never seen him
in such a hurry
to open a chicken pit.
Is Arnold a good driver?
Don't upset Arnold.
I want to upset Clyde.
Arnold, he's tryin' to lose us.
Thinks if I get mad, I'll fire him.
If we lose him, I'm going to fire you.
Me?
I ain't mad.
He'll fire me.
He won't fire you.
Hang in there, Arnold.
I got him.
He's tryin' to make me mad.
He'll fire me.
He won't fire you.
Don't lose him.
Oh, my god!
Grab somethin' that floats, boss.
I ain't mad.
No. I'm not mad.
He's going to be thinkin' that I'm mad,
but I ain't.
I'm mad.
Just turn Stroker upside down,
and get that free chicken leg.
Another winner here
at Clyde Torkle's chicken pit.
Get that free chicken leg.
Step right up. They're goin' fast.
Better get your lucky shot here.
Is that Stroker Ace in that race car?
Afraid it is.
Come on!
We got one more big winner here.
Who's going to be next?
That's all, young fella.
Doc, is that you?
It's me.
Hey!
How you doin'?
Havin' a lot of fun.
Hey, you're lookin' good.
You, too. Lot of color in your face.
Lugs, meet Doc Seegle.
His dad taught me how to drive.
Heard a lot about you.
Nice to meet you.
Come on. Let me see your best shot.
Wh-where is dad?
He's right here with me.
Stroker, we're mighty proud
of you back home.
Thanks.
Bull's-eye!
Thank you.
At least we was.
Acting is one of my favorite things.
I can't believe you're an actor.
How long have you been at it?
Not long. Got the urge
a couple years back.
I can't get over you bein' an actor.

hypochondriacs, and sissies.
Well, they are, but I like them.

Hey, Pembrook.
Hi, Lugs.
What's the matter, hon?
It's Stroker. He's just...
Where is he?
He is making a phone call.
Hey, Doc.
Are you really a good actor?
I need help with my contract.
Stroker, come on out here!
It's a hell of an idea.
In a second, Lugs.
Right now!
Doc...
Doc, I can't hear you.
Doc, I got this idea
on how to get out of my contract.
Mr. MacKenzie... hot damn!
For a little
redneck company like mine,
it's somethin' to be talkin' to you
yankee boys from Milwaukee.
We've impressed with your
company growth, Mr. Torkle.
That's really somethin',
isn't it, comin' from you?
You've done well these past
few months, particularly.
How could you know that?
'Cause that's secret
company information.
Believe me, we know.
Damn! You corporate boys are
really somethin', aren't you?
You got a real operation.
We want to buy your company.
Well, it's not for sale.
Well, I've written down a figure
on this piece of paper.
I think that figure's
just a little low, Mr. MacKenzie.
That's exactly 10% higher
than this company's total worth...
To the exact cent.
20% over stock value.
Damn!
You really are somethin', aren't you?
Let me get you somethin' to drink.
Anything you'd like.
A Dr. Pepper.
What's a good ol' boy
from the brewin' company
doin' drinkin' a Dr. Pepper?
Well, it's a little early.
I thought I'd...
I got you.
You're going to buy
them out, too, ain't ya?
Damn! See?
You are somethin'.
Got your fingers in everything.
Well, I'm not at Liberty
to discuss that.
I'm a businessman..
I understand that.
Then I hope you understand
there are a few stipulations
to my offer.
Foremost, you tell nobody about this.
Do I look like a bigmouth?
Secondly, if you sell,
we'd like a two-year employment contract
between you and your key people.
You'd be gettin' the best.
And we take over your
advertising immediately.
You sponsor a driver with
a questionable reputation.
Can you get rid of him?
Like that.
We'd like your answer by 4:00 Sunday.
Sunday?
That's too quick.
I can't do that.
We have no deal, Mr. Torkle.
Goodbye.
Mr. MacKenzie, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
It's too quick.
I'll give you an answer
Sunday, October 23rd at 4:00.
Sunday, 23rd, 4:00. It's a deal.
Deal? October 23rd in Charlotte?
That's the last race of the season.
Stroker, I did my best.
You got till 4:00.
The race is over at 4:00.
I did my best.
He's got to fire Stroker
during the season.
He's discover there's no deal.
I did my best.
You said that.
Son, I'm about to run out over here.
I did my best.
Let's pack up
and get out of here.
You're a good boy.
I don't want to hear that crap.
He hit me. I can't remember his name.
You never can.
He spun me out. What should I do?
Stick him in the fence.
Good idea, Neil.

Aubrey.
Whatever.

Never mind. I'm calling Torkle.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Charlotte
motor speedway.
Hey, Stroker.
How about this?
There's somethin' I want you to know.
I'm thinkin' about
sellin' my little business.
If I do, I'll let you go.
If you win this race,
you'll be too valuable
a commodity to let go.
I'd have to expand
that little business...
We'd have two more
glorious years together.
You know somethin'?
You lose the race, I'll set you free.
You win the race, I got to keep you.
What do you say?
Ever throw a race before?
All drivers to your cars!
Better get out there.
Them boys are waitin' for you.
Kind of a mess, ain't it?
Hey, Arnold!
Wait up.
Welcome to the Charlotte motor speedway
Later today we will have
a new national champion.
Working with me
is bill dollar and David Hobbs.
We'll be back after this.
Tell Mr. Big to come here
to say hello to
these people if he wins.
Five hours in a race is tiring.
I don't think...
I don't pay you to think.
Just deliver the message.
Hey!
Where the hell is my blimp?
There it is.
There it is. I love it!
That's me! I love it!
I want you fourth or fifth,
but not too far back.
Gum!
I haven't got any.
Where is it?
It doesn't matter
whether I win or lose.
The field begins to roll down pit row.
A kaleidoscope of colors,
ready to do battle for 500 miles.
Coming down to this last race,
four men are in the running
for the championship...
Stroker Ace, Aubrey James,
Harry Gant, and Cale Yarborough.
Who will win?
There are rumors of a feud
between Stroker Ace and James.
That could affect the outcome.
Bill knows more about that.
I asked Stroker Ace.
He answered, "what feud?"
We'll find out.
The cars are waiting
for the green flag.
Field on the tow of the pace car.
Moving into the fourth corner,
they're less than 1,000 feet
away from the start
of this $500,000 chase,
the final race of the season,
the championship on the line.
Here come the warlords.
The pace car pulls off onto pit row.
Here they come...
Less than 500 feet
from Harold Kinder holding them down.
Out of turn four,
they're back to the stripe.
Look at that draft up front!
Shepard, Cale Yarborough,
and Harry Gant!
And are they setting a blistering pace!
We're early in this 500-mile race
at Charlotte motor speedway.
Stroker Ace is moving to the front.
Talk about a guy driving his heart out.
Stroker Ace has worked his way
in front of the field.
You guys are setting
a new track record.
Damn!
Get some caution flags,
the race could last till 4:30.
Stroker must be in trouble.
He's been passed by four cars.
We'll keep you informed.
What are you doing?
Gettin' out of the chicken business.
Stroker, this is humiliating.
Well, then don't watch!
What is he doin'?
I'll be damned.
Mr. All-American hero
is goin' in the tank.
Mr. Torkle!
There's someone here
that says he's from
the brewing company.
First caution of the afternoon
at Charlotte motor speedway.
The strategy has changed
for this race...
A time strategy, not a speed battle.
The leaders come in.
What a break for Stroker Ace,
who was almost 1/2 lap back.
He may make up that 1/2 lap...
Hopefully get service for the problem.
Stroker, you're embarrassing me!
You got the key to the rest room?
I guess not.!
You sure you wouldn't like a Miller's?
Four?
Oh, yeah. 4:00.
Hell, we got plenty of time.
Listen, where is that guy MacKenzie?
I know nothing.
I am merely the messenger.
I know. I know.
You said that before.
A real battle,
but the heated battle is in front.
Yarborough and Gant
keep swapping that lead,
lap after lap after lap.
What's Stroker doing?
Don't worry. Run your race.
We're seeing some blazing speed.
The average is 154.25 miles an hour.
Unless we have a wreck,
this is going to be
the fastest 500-mile race.

Got too much ego.
Fine. Next year we'll
open the rib pits.
Time is running out.
That battle up front is unreal.
Gant is your leader.
Stroker Ace has moved into second.
Move!
Hell. Here we go again.
The caution is out...
The way they were running,
it had to happen.
No record race today.
It took out Harry Gant.
We're down to three...
Cale Yarborough,
Aubrey James, and Stroker.
Hey, what happened?
Everything's OK.
Aubrey James just got
a little ambitious.
He's comin' in!
Hurry up! Number 10 is leaving!
We'll beat him.
The Jack's broke!
Broke!
Go borrow one!
Hello, Arnold. You do this often?
Just want to be on the winnin' team.
We got a new Jack man!
The yellow is still out.
Stroker Ace is getting in line...
In sixth place.
Twelve laps to go.
With few laps and stiff competition,
Stroker's chances are slim to none.
That Jack problem
dropped Stroker to sixth place.
Aubrey James passed him
and took the lead.
Cale Yarborough's car is in the pits.
He's out of it.
Hey, you!

I am merely...
A messenger. Yes, sir.
Here is the message.

It has been a wild afternoon.
The green is back out.
The battle shapes up at turn one.
Dad just called!
Hey, Stroker! Dad called and said,
"stand on it, son!"
This is as good as it gets.
Stroker Ace is passing cars
in wholesale fashion.
Hey, press boys!
You're here to get the news, ain't you?
I got an exclusive for you.
As of this moment,
Stroker Ace is no longer
driving for me.
He's through. He's released.
Off the record, he's out on his butt
because he no longer represents
the Clyde Torkle chicken pit image.
Why fire him when he's in second place?
What?
He just moved into second place.
It started out with four,
then three, now it's two.
The only thing
between Stroker Ace
and the checkered flag is Aubrey James.
In two laps,
one of them will be
the NASCAR champion.
I got you now!
Damn!
It's the white flag. One lap to go.
30 seconds!
It portends to be a dramatic finish.
Come on, 10!
The whole NASCAR season will be
decided by a matter of inches
Come on!
How's this for spectacular?
Unbelievable!
