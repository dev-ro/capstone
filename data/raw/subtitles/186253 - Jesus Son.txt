It's McInnes I'm worried about
 McInnes ?
 Yeah, he caught me
kissing Michelle
Which one was Michelle ?
On the day, He'll open all
our eyes clean with His light,
and we just want you
to be ready
If He wanted to end it,
He'd have ended it by now
Yeah, well, it is hard to know
what He's thinking sometimes
Yeah
But patience
is part of believing

Hey
Hey, can I keep this ?
Uh
This is the longest
that I've lived anywhere
18 months
I don't have ajob
No kidding

I smoke cigarettes
And you talk nonstop
No, I don't
No, usually I don't
Except when I'm nervous
Do I make you nervous ?
No, no
Yeah, maybe a little
I heard about I heard
about your boyfriend McInnes
I mean
I was there
I know
I heard you tried
to help him
that you were the only one
Is that true ?
He, he almost made it
What wereyou saying before,
to those Jehovah's Witness
guys ?
Oh
[ Clears Throat ]
Lookwhat they gave me
I was asking them if,
when we die,
if there's an ending
to everything we know
And if there is,
then why don't we just die now,
die to everything we know
And maybe living and dying
are the same thing
And maybe the fact
that we've turned them
into two different things
is whywe feel so lost
Man
[ Chuckles ]
Wow
I'm not planning on dying
anytime soon,
but ifI do,
I'm sure to come back
and tell you all about it
No, don't do that
Do us both a favor
Rest in peace
[ Chuckles ]
Can I kiss you now ?
No
It's all right
It sticks
Oh, I'm sorry

 What's going on, Georgie ?
 His face is dark
Just a while ago
Mywife did it
I was peeping on the lady
next doorwhile she was bathing
My wife waited
till I fell asleep, and then
she decided she'd blind me
Do you want me
to call the police ?
Uh
not unless I die
Here's the situation

an entire team
I want a good eye man
The best eye man
A great eye man
I want a brain surgeon
And I want
a really good gas man
Get me a genius
I'm not touching that head
We'll prep this guy,
and we'll just sit back
and we'll sit tight
Orderly
Orderly
Doyou mean me ?
Is this a hospital ?
Is this the emergency room ?
Is that the patient ?
Areyou the orderly ? Well

with a knife
a hunting knife
sticking into his brain
Yeah, it's sticking
into his brain Yeah
Well, the family service
doctor is here, but he is
uh, limited ?


Like, the best that you've got
And a brain surgeon



That person is not right
Not at all Not one bit
As long as my instructions
are ''audiable'' to him,
it does not concern me
 Well, okay, okay
Don't chew my head off
 Okay
All right The eye man
is on vacation or something
But the operator is calling
around to see if she can find
someonejust as good
All of the other specialists
are hurrying through the night
to join us

What have you got ?
Oh, boy
Patient complains
ofk nife in the head
Stabbing headache ?
[ Laughing ]
Where'd you get that ?
Your shoelace is untied
Oh
How's the guy doin' ?
Who ?

He's not dead ?
No, his vitals are normal,
and he still has excellent
vision in his one good eye
So he's alive
There's nothin' wrong
with the guy
It's just one ofthose things
What do you do
around here anyway ?
I save lives
I think it's morning
You want me to take you home ?
No No way I feel
like a giant helium balloon
I gotta go out
Doctor

Me and Michelle

I wanna go to church
You should go

I'd like to worship
I would
They have these injured hawks
and eagles there
from the Humane Society
I need a
quiet chapel about now
Whoo !

 There were rides
 I didn't see one ride !

There was a Ferris wheel,
and there was a thing
they called the Hammer
that people were bent over
vomiting from after
they got off
Areyou completely blind ?
 A rabbit !
 Something thumped
You hit him
 thumped
Rabbit stew
Where's my hunting knife ?
Where's my hunting knife ?
Georgie
We'll camp in the wilderness
In the morning, we'll breakfast
on its haunches




I should have been
a doctor

Oh, no way

I gotta drive ! Take 'em !



[ Engine Starts ]
[ Tires Screeching ]
Yeah !
[ Laughing ]

 These rabbits

How far are we from home ?
We're right outside town
We'vejust been driving
around and around
This is no place to camp
I can hear the interstate
right over there
We better get some milk
for the bunnies
Well, we don't

We'll mix sugar up with it
Uh

 They're mammals, man !
 Oh, forget about the rabbits

You're not listening to me
Forget about the rabbits !
Where are they ?
They They, um

[ Crying ]
They slid around behind me
and got squashed
[ Crying Continues ]
[ Mumbling ]


Everything is here
Little feet, eyelids,
even whiskers
Deceased !
Does everything you touch
turn to shit ?

No wonder everybody
calls me '' Fuck Head''
It's a name
that's going to stick
'' Fuck Head'' is gonna
ride you to your grave
I already said so
I agreed with you in advance

What's the film ?

It's performed
right here in the office
setting, as a rule
It is intended
to be a permanent type
of sterilization
And I would hope that that's
what you have in mind
If you are not satisfied
that this is
I'm not ever getting
anybody pregnant again
I know that much
Would you like to make
an appointment ?
Would you like

Michelle
Areyou high ?
No
Yeah
But I need to talk to you
She's got her future
to think of
Just keep out ofit
What if you just tried
a little harder, huh ?
What if you just try
to make it work ?
What if you just pretended
you were the one ?
Don't do this, baby
Areyou gonna answer
my question or not ?
What question ?














Hey, man, what's happening ?

They're looking
for a guy with a hood
What'd he do ?








You were on the El
You following me ?


Hey !





[ Panting ]
Yeah, for some reason,
Mexico stands out in my mind
[ Shuddering ]
[ Phone Ringing ]
Hello ?
Wait
Iowa City ?


I'm gifted with love
I love my kids
I love all my relatives

I got my girlfriend
She's cute
Michelle
Yeah



[ Man Gasping ]
It's all right
You're gonna be okay
There's been an accident !
Go for help !
[ Whimpering ]
You smell
Um so how was Mexico ?
Hot
But I made good money
I was gonna go down there
to find you,
but then I heard
you were here
I was in a bad carwreck
What ?
Wereyou driving ?
Mmm, what difference
does it make ? People died
I saved the baby
What are you talking about ?
Nothin'
Forget about it
Uh I shouldn't

[ Indistinct ]
You know what ?

Maybe I can helpyou





[ Indistinct Whispering ]

Oh, I'm sorry
[ Sobbing ]
My sweet angel,

[ Mumbling ]
Oh, nothing
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ]
Baby
Michelle, wake up
Wake up
Baby ?
Baby ! Baby !
[ Grunting ]
Wake up !
[ Sobbing ]
Wake up ! Wake up !

[ Sniffing ]
Hey, wake up
Hey, wanna buy a pill ?
What kind ofpill ?
It's, um, psychedelic
mushrooms all ground up
That's the biggest pill
I've ever seen
Look at it
It's like an egg
It's like an Easter thing
Let's take him into ''A''
Areyou hearing any unusual
sounds or voices ?

Not exactly
Not exactly ?
Now, what does that mean ?
I'm not ready
to go into that
It's okay
Areyou in pain ?
[ Gagging ]
Gauze
[ Groaning ]

Don't get tricky
with the moustache
Okay so far ?
Yeah, so far
[ Chuckles ]
I'll do the other side
That would make sense,
partner
There are some people out there
who would like to know
a thing or two about you
Would you describe yourself
for those people ?
I don't know
I'm like a fat
piece of shit, I guess
He's overweight
I've been shot
twice, though
Twice ?
Yeah, once
by each wife
Total of three bullets
making four holes
Three in, one out
Huh, and you're
still alive
Areyou kidding ?
[ Laughs ]
No
Well, that is too bad
Because it makes you sound
stupid asking if I'm alive,
'cause obviously I am
Well maybe
I mean alive
Careful
in a deeper sense
You could be talking
and still not be alive
in a deeper sense
Well, there's no deeper shit
than the kind we're in now
I'll tell you that
What are you talking about ?
It's great here
They even give you cigarettes
Well, they didn't
give me any yet
Oh
Here you go
Thanks
Pay me back
when you get yours ?
Maybe
You got a wife ?
No No, but I just can't
talk about that right now
Look, there's no problem,
butyou don't have to talk
about it
So what did you say
when she shot you ?
I said, ''You shot me''
[ Laughing ]
Both times ? Both wives ?
Well, the first time I
didn't say anything, 'cause
she shot me in the mouth
All right,
soyou couldn't talk ?
No, I was knocked out cold
is the reason I couldn't talk
And I still remember
the dream
Ohh
that I had when I was
knocked out that time
What was the dream ?
Well, now how can I
explain that toyou ?
It was a dream
It didn't mean
a fucking thing, man
Anything,
anything at all
Well, there is
one thing
Hmm ?
The dream that I had
keeps coming back
over and over,
and I mean
when I'm awake
Every time I think
about my first wife,
I remember that she
pulled the trigger on me,
then here comes the dream
[ Laughs, Sighs ]
Did you ever see
that Elvis Presley movie,
  ?
I did see that, and I was
just gonna mention that
You saw that ?
No
You
Okay, you're all done
There was a song
'' Follow That Dream'' too
Oh Look in the mirror
All right
What do you see ?
How did I get so fat
when I hardly eat ?
Is that all ?
[ Groans ]
Wrecked cars ?
Any people in them ?
Yeah
Who ?
People are just
dead meat now, man
Is that really how it is ?
How would I know how it is ?
I just got here, and it stinks
Areyou kidding ?
Hey, they're pumping
Halidol by the quart
It's a playpen
Yeah, well,
I'm older than you are
You can still go on the wheel
a couple of more times
and get off with all your arms
and legs stuck on right
Not me
Hey, you're doin' fine
Hey, talk into here
Talk into your bullet hole ?
Yeah
Talk into my bullet hole
and tell me that I'm fine











There's a price to be paid
for dreaming


[ Man Muttering, Coughing ]
Oh, there he is
Gotta go
How's it going ?
Hi
Here's the, uh
Here's the next issue
You know,
it's part of your job
to touch the residents here
These people
more than anything,
they need to be touched
Okay
So when you say
hello to them,
be sure to put
your hands on them
Okay, okay
Okay, good
Okay










Why I must dream 


and all screwed up,
you know ?
Did you ever
do that ? Huh ?
Walk past the houses
with the curtains
in the windows
and you feel like
you're to tin' a big cart
of sins behind you ?
And you ever think that
behind those windows,
behind those curtains,
that people are leadin'
normal, happy lives ?
Huh ?
Well, that's my goal now,
is to be one ofthose
people on the other side
ofthose curtains
Have my own window,
you know ? Hi


[ Chattering ]
I'll driveyou
Is anyone going downtown ?
No, sorry
No, sorry, I'm not
Areyou going home ?
Yeah, but I'm stopping
by my mother's
Where areyou headed ?
Las Calinas Boulevard
Oh, I'll take you there
Come on
So, what brought you here ?
You mean to AA ?
No, to Phoenix
Oh, uh, I don't
I don't
A couple reasons
For one, I thought
my brother was here
Well, is he ?
Uh, no
It's right here
I mean, I don't know
I don't know where he is

Uh, my girl
my girlfriend's not here

[ Quiet Chattering ]


[ Muttering Continues ]
What ?
I can't
I'm sorry, but
I can't understand
It's all right, Max
It's all right
Here, let go
[ Yelling ]
All right, fine
Max got a letter today
His wife's divorcing him
She dropped him off

better wait outside
[ Grunting ]
Come on, Max
Let's go inside
[ Yelling Continues ]
















Take what you need




[ Muttering ]


before the engine caught
him, but he was wrong
My first husband
fell through a thousand
evergreen branches
in the mountains
up around Cholo
He was a tree surgeon,
and he crushed his head

Well, two boyfriends
who died in the Marines
Another one named Zack
got killed in a one car
accident
right out of basic training
Almost every
man I've ever loved
ended up getting killed
I told you about my
third husband, didn't I ?
The one who almost
bought the pet shop
[ Both Chuckling ]
[ Sobbing ]
He was the one who OD'd
He's the one who OD'd
You know, ifit wasn't
for him dying, I would still
be out there with that man
I was married
to a black guy once,
but he got shanked
in prison
That means stabbed,
stabbed to death
Doesn't it make you
grateful ?
Because they were, theywere
people just like us,
only unluckier
i have an announcement
to make, and an apology

uh, left out somebody's
birthday last month
Uh, Isaac Kristofferson

Whoo
Whoo !
 Whoo
 [ Cheering ]
Many happy returns
