My name is Pacu,
It's a brand new name,
so I'm not used to it yet,
I'm trying to remember a story,
Sometimes I can,
Sometimes I get mixed up,
Because there's another one
stuck in my head,
It's about me, my brother,
and a shirt in the wind,
The blood is starting
to turn yellow.
BEHIND THE SUN
It's Pa who drives
the oxen 'round the mill,
In Grandpa's time,
the slaves did all the work,
Now we do it.
Tonio, my brother,
crushes the sugarcane,
Ma gathers the scraps,
Bring more cane, kid.
Hurry up!
 Ma says
God never gives us...
heavier burdens
than we can bear,
But God keeps messing up,
He sometimes dumps such burdens
on us, we all collapse,
We live in Stream-of-Souls,
It's in the middle of nothing,
All we know is it's above
the ground and below the sun,
It's so hot that it
sets our hearts boiling...
like a pot of molasses,
 Tonio, I dreamed
about Inacio again,
Go back to sleep now.
Go on, kid.
And now, sleep.
Go on, go on!
The blood has turned yellow.
Tonio...
you know what you have to do.
Don't go, Tonio.
Your brother's soul
isn't at rest.
He did what he had to do.
It's Tonio's turn now.
Don't go.
 Listen to me, kid,
Your grandfather, your uncles,
your oldest brother...
all died for this land
and for our honor.
One day, it could be you.
You're a Breves,
I, too, did my duty.
But it wasn't God's will
that I die.
Tonio, you'll leave
at daybreak,
And remember...
you're only to seek out
your brother's killer.
Man to man, face to face.
 Tonio will be walking
over land that used to be ours,
The Ferreiras took it from us
and we took it back,
Now it's theirs again,
That's how the feud began,
Pa says it's an eye for an eye,
One of theirs
for one of ours...
and so on, until everyone
ended up blind,
In the land of the blind...
one-eyed people are
said to be mad,
MOTHER: May God consent,
may it be God's will,
May the soul of Inacio,
my first- born...
find peace alongside his own.
May each drop of his blood
cost the enemy two.
May you, my son...
find the peace you never found
among the living.
And watch over your brothers

when their turn comes,
 Everything quiet?
GUARD: Yes, sir,
Like this.
Go outside, kid.
For my brother!
I won't pray for your grandson's
soul, since he killed my son.
But I respect your suffering.
It's the same as mine.
Today, ours is greater.
My son asks permission
to attend the vigil...
...to pray for the deceased's soul.
Afterwards, if you accept,
he'd like to talk to you.
- Where is he?
- Outside.
Thank you.
Good-bye, my friend.
I prayed for the deceased.
I came to the wake
and the burial.
Now, I'd like to talk to you.
I request a truce.
Grandfather,
don't accord a truce.
The truce is granted.
The same one your father
granted to my grandson.
Until the next moon.
From one death to the next.
This is your guarantee until the full moon.
After that, when the blood turns yellow, it will expire.
How old are you?
Twenty.
Your life is now split in two.
The twenty years you've
already lived...
...and the short time
you have left.
Have you ever known love?
You never will.
Do you hear that clock?
Each time it ticks-one more,
one more, one more...
...it will be telling you...
...one less, one less, one less.
Good morning.
Good morning.
 Do you know
of a little village...
near here
called Born Sossago?
It's over there.
But it's not little.
 It's not?
What's this place called?
Stream-of-Souls.
So where's the stream?
Dried up.
Only the souls remain.
What is your name?
- Kid.
What?
I don't have a name.
- What do they call you?
- They just call me kid.
They call the kid "kid."
Kid!
Here, this is for you.
Can you read?
No.
But I can read pictures.
Hey, kid!
Stay away from those vagrants!
 Ma thinks the bloodstain
will come out,
But it won't come out,
 You did your duty,
my son,
Now you have much to do
before the next moon.
Crush the sugarcane
and fix the roof...
in case it rains this year.
It never rains.
Then the raw sugar
has to be sold in the village.
 That sounded like
a bad dream, Tonio,
I tried to wake you up,
but you didn't want to,
What are you doing up, kid?
Reading.
Where'd you get that?
A present.
From who?
The girl gave it to me.
What girl?
My friend, of course.
- You went into town alone?
No.
They were lost.
But not anymore.
I showed them the way.
So what's that book about?
It's about everything.
Something's wrong, kid.
- What's wrong?
- It's upside down.
No, it's not.
Want to bet?
It's the same this way...
...or that way.
No difference, see?
You don't know a thing
about books. Give it to me.
-  It's her!
- TONIO: Her? Who?
The girl who gave me the book.
She lives in the sea with the
fish, the crabs, and the boats.
She'll take me with her.
She'll teach me
the alphabet and all.
You don't believe me?
When I grow up,
we'll get married.
- Has she been informed?
- No.
It's still a secret.
 One day...
...the mermaid comes up
to the surface.
And she saw the tree, the cows,
the mountains, and grass.
When she looked at the top of
the raw-sugar house...
she saw the rooster with the
mangy neck crowing for her.
Wow, she really liked that!
And she also saw
the sugarcane, the mill...
...everything delighted her!
But the best part of all
was when she saw the kid.
Are you still reading that book?
Can't you see it will
hurt your eyes?
I'm trying to remember
the story.
Sometimes I can,
sometimes I forget.
Then just forget.
Well?
It is beginning to change color.
It won't take long now.
No, it won't.
You're the most important
merchant in town...
but with all due respect,
this isn't the right amount.
MR, LOURENCO: No,
It is the right amount,
But I gave you
the usual quantity.
Steam power is bringing
the price down. It's progress.
I think you should follow
the example, Mr. Breves.
But Mr. Lourenço,
we had an agreement.
There is no shortage
of raw sugar!
 Come on up!
Come one, come all,
if you want to watch...
the snake and the toad dance!
Everyone will come.
Together we will go.
Tomorrow night,
no one will sleep.
No man, no woman, no child.
Come one, come all!
Mr. Lourenço wants to decide
other people's suffering.
I saw her.
Who?
The mermaid.
Up on stilts.
On what?
She's in the circus.
They're bringing
the circus to town...
with a fire-eater, a clown...
and a snake that dances
with a toad.
- A snake with a what?
- A toad.
Hey, are you daydreaming, kid?
More cane!
 Hurry up
with that cane!
Tonio.
I want to go to the circus
real bad.
You think Pa will let you?
We're like oxen here.
We go 'round and 'round
and never go anywhere.
We go 'round and 'round
and never go anywhere.
You want to see the circus?
Then let's go.
See? I told you,
she's hot stuff.
Fire! Fire!
I'll be damned!
I'm toasted!
Salustiana, look who's here.
Hey! It's the kid
without a name.
Anything's better
than "Salustiana."
My name's Clara.
What's yours?
That's Tonio, my brother.
Good evening.
Did you like the show?
I liked the fire best.
You're really hot!
Holy shit!
I brought the book so you can
remind me of the story.
It's late now.
SALUS TlANA: Hey, kid...</i
I'm going to give you a name.
A name all your own.
What's your favorite animal?
Do you like birds?
He only likes sea creatures.
Oh, yeah? Then I'll
name you Sardine!
You bullshitting me?
We'll choose another name.
Pacu.
Pacu.
I've christened you,
You have a name now.
And I'm your godfather,
To celebrate your christening!
-  I don't like it,
- TONIO: What?
The name.
Pacu.
He's pulling my leg.
Pacu is a kind of river fish.
Tonio.
Do you think
they sleep together?
I don't know.
All I know is,
he's your godfather now.
Pacu!
Pacu!
Pacu!
Pacu!
Cut it out, will you?
Where'd you take the kid?
Where?
To the circus.
Where?
The circus.
Go to your room, kid.
Right now!
 Having fun
at a time like this?
Have you no respect
for our dead?
You should follow
your older brother's example.
Don't worry.
I'll soon be like him.
Shut up.
Sorry, but I won't shut up.
- Shut your mouth.
- No!
- Shut up!
- No!
-  Shut up!
- TONIO: No!
- I won't!
- Shut up!
 Tonio,
You have to go away.
Did you see his black armband?
Yes.
He won't be around much longer.
- What are you talking about?
- It's true.
It's a family feud.
One side kills, then the other.
- How do you know?
- It goes way back.
They're fighting for the land.
They'd rather kill
than solve their problems.
Real fanatics.
It's like the two snakes
I saw fighting.
Each was biting the tail
of the other.
They ate each other up
until nothing was left.
Nothing but a pool of blood
on the ground.
They'll all be killed off.
I feel sorry for them.
I really do.
Stay in line!
Keep it going, Slowpoke!
Keep turning!
Come on, Blocky!
That's good, my ox.
¡Tonio!
The oxen are going 'round
on their own!
Need some help?
I can always use help.
Especially if it's free.
Where's my godson?
At home.
Come for the circus?
You'll have to wait
till next year.
We're off to Ventura
for the festival.
Ever been to Ventura?
No. I haven't been anywhere.
Were you born
dead or alive?
What?
Were you born
dead or alive?
Alive.
Well, I was born dead.
True or false?
True, I'm afraid.
Let me explain.
My mother almost died
giving birth.
I was born purple-so purple
they thought I was dead.
True or false?
They ignored me for two hours
while trying to save my mother.
Then they decided to wash me so
I'd look decent for the funeral.
As soon as I felt the cold
water, I started howling.
As a result, that was
my first and last bath.
No more baths!
And the second result:
Nothing bothers me.
Anyone born dead has
been through the worst.
After that, life's a breeze.
No kidding!
So when it comes to water...
I don't even use it
for drinking!
Yuck! Let's go, Bootleg!
How long do you have?
Not long.
I'll go as far as Ventura,
then I have to go back,
SALUS TlANA: Clara...
where are you?
In this house, the dead
command the living.
Sometimes I wish Tonio
wouldn't come back.
Don't say that, woman.
Even the worst life
is better...
than being slaughtered
like an animal.
Look around you, woman.
What do we have left?
Nothing.
You see, we've already
lost everything.
And if Tonio doesn't come back,
we'll have lost our honor, too.
Let's go, Bootleg!
Come on, Bootleg!
Sleep well, young man?
 The mermaid
coul dn't live on land...
because she had
a fish-tail...
The poor thing couldn't walk.
Even so, one day she got furious
and jumped out of the sea!
She started fighting
with snakes and toads.
Then, because she missed
the kid so much...
she started puffing out
fire and smoke.
So the kid got
on a tired old ox...
and galloped after the mermaid,
Do-dum, do-dum,
looking for the mermaid.
He went through the woods,
the cane fields...
and when he parted
the last row of sugarcane...
he came upon the sea.
And he found the mermaid.
Following in your brother's footsteps?
Think you can just
take it easy around here?
 Give me my book!
Give it to me!
GROUP: Die, you rabid dog!
Take that! To hell with the traitor!
 Don't tell me this
shitty circus is still around,
What did you say?
 You heard me,
- Shit what?
Circus!
Get out of here!
You lousy bum!
Reginaldo. Come here!
Shitty things are impossible
to get rid of. Like you.
You mean like you.
REGINALDO: Is that Clara?
Your stepdaughter?
Spitting image of her mother.
REGINALDO: How she's grown!
Do it right, kid.
You're big enough now.
Come, Tonio.
I'm going to show you
something, Tonio.
Help me. Pull on the rope.
CLARA: Start turning,
Turn it faster, Tonio.
Faster!
Faster!
Even more!
I'll never forget this...
or you.
Neither will I, Tonio.
 Clara!
The shirt is almost yellow now.
It always turns yellow.
With your permission...
I could get the men together...
and wipe those Breves
from the face of this earth,
 I'll repeat this one last time,
Blood has the same volume
for everyone.
You have no right to take more
than the blood taken from you.
Otherwise, you'll pay twice-
in this life and in the next.
That's what my father taught me
and his father taught him.
And that's how it'll be
until I die.
I taught you how to fly
with this, remember?
You were scared shitless.
Tonio, today it's your turn.
You take my place,
I'll take yours.
No, I don't want to.
Tonio!
Tonio. Tonio.
Tonio. Tonio.
You're too damn strong.
No, you just forgot how to fly.
Let me, it's my turn!
Ooh, it's hot!
This is my favorite part
of the show.
Come on! Who's next!
Keep filling it!
Fill it up!
You can't do this.
Anyhow, he's already dead.
But I'm not.
It's turned yellow.
Is it really yellow now?
 Yes, it's yellowed,
You know what you
have to do, then.
Yes, I know.
Tonio, you know
the truce ends today.
From now on,
it depends on the shirt.
Don't go too far from the house.
Stay close to me,
And always carry the gun,
It's going to rain.
No, it's not the rainy season.
I know it's going to rain.
Tonio?
Pa took my book.
I can't remember the story
or the mermaid's face anymore.
The mermaid...
Had a fish tail...
while the boy had
toes, feet, and...
Aren't you going to sleep, Pacu?
Aren't you going to sleep, Pacu?
Then talk in silence.
OK.
Tonio.
Clara...
I wanted to tell you
I've left everything.
I'm heading east, to the coast.
You have the right
to do it, too.
I'll be waiting.
 Now you know my story,
But I still can't
remember the other one,
The mermaid, the ships-damn!
The kid couldn't find
the mermaid...
no, it wasn't like that,
Damn,
It's the mermaid who came
looking-yeah, that's it,
I think I'm remembering it!
One day, the mermaid came
and took him to live with her,
And he really liked that!
She turned the kid
into a fish...
and took him to live
in the east, at the sea,
In the sea, everyone wasn't
dying all the time,
There was a lot of room
for everyone,
In the sea, they lived
so happily...
so happily, they couldn't
stop laughing,
In the sea, they were so happy,
so happy together...
they couldn't help laughing.
Tonio!
Oh, God, not my son!
Not my son!
They've killed the kid.
Get the gun, Tonio! Right now!
There's no truce,
go avenge the blood!
Reclaim the blood of those pigs!
Go, my son! Reclaim the blood!
Immediately!
What are you doing?
The gun!
Where's the gun, Tonio?
Tonio!
Tonio!
Vuelve!
Come back or you'll die
for the honor of the family.
It's over! Don't you see?
It's all over!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
