and the West -

1600 A.D.
Miyamoto ViIIage
What wiII you do? Have you decided
about a woman? -Are you going?
I am going
I'II be famous after
my first battIe
Then what wiII the viIIage
eIders say!
What do you say?
Join me
Oh yes!
You have your mother to Iook after
And Otsu to marry
I am aII aIone. You are not
I wiII go aIone
Takezo!
Takezo!
Bad one! CIimbing trees again!
Takezo!
The priest wiII scoId you!
ReaIIy, Takezo!
You too, Matahachi!
Listen, Otsu!
You are engaged to me, aren't you?
If, weII, for instance, if...
If I Ieft for a year,
what wouId you do?
WouId you wait for me?
-Where are you going?
I am not going anywhere
I mean, ''in case''
I wouId wait. For a year,
even for ten years!
You wiII?
You are going to battIe!
-No. Not I!
You Iie!
Takezo has tempted you
Do not go, pIease!
What wiII become of me?
I have tested your Iove.
-Do not go!
I wiII never Ieave you!
BattIe of Sekigahara
Look! What's that?
Run for your Iife! Run!
No use digging!
Run! QuickIy!
UnbeIievabIe!
Where are our troops?
Enemy crossed the river!
We've been defeated! Routed!
Can this be the end of the war?
They make us dig Iike sIaves
But the war is Iost!
You run!
-And you?
Our cause is not Iost.
I wiII fight on!
Me, too!
-No! Run!
It is not over yet.
I may get a captain's head!
Courage! Matahachi!
Your wound is sIight!
I wiII die!
Don't taIk Iike that.
-I want to Iive to see her!
Courage!
I see a house!
I can't quite make it out.
Keep your strength up
Otsu is an orphan
After I am gone,
pIease Iook after her
Spare no one!
Search everywhere!
Look! Matahachi!
The house!
I can't go on.
-It is true! Look!
Mother!
Give us food!
And keep quiet!
You must be hungry.
Sorry I am Iate
Thank you. I wiII eat Iater
I'm tired of eating grueI.
-The wound is heaIing fast
It has been two months aIready
Where is he?
-Riding again. He Iikes to
It's not just that.
He's trying to conquer the horse
He rides untiI he exhausts it
He has aIways been ruthIess.
-I Iike that type of man!
How I Iong for home!
But this must mend itseIf first
The skin has not heaIed over
I can waIk, though.
-Do not overexert yourseIf
We cannot stay here forever.
-But we are gIad to have you
You see, we are aIone.
It is IoneIy here
Stay untiI you recover.
-The enemy might discover us
They do not Iook for such
unimportant... Pardon me!
Unimportant. That's right!
Let me do it
We Ieft home thinking we couId
become samurai so easiIy
What a dream!
Bear it, weakIing!
Takezo!
Give me a ride!
Otsu, my Iove!
Forgive me!
Who is this Otsu?
-A girI of our viIIage
Your sweetheart?
-No, Matahachi's betrothed
Matahachi's?
-A nice, sweet girI
And she exceIIed a rough riding
You think I'II be frightened?
-You wiII if I Iet him out!
I wiII not! Try him!
You'II scream.
Your mother wiII be angry
Do not worry!
I wiII not scream. PIease!
Stubborn!
-Coward!
Coward?
-You big coward!
Do not cry out!
Are you aII right?
That crazy mean horse!
It is not his fauIt.
-You think it's mine?
Do not be angry
Why don't you hoId me
in your arms?
Women!
Wench! Listen!
Is your mother home?
Warn her!
TeII her she's trespassing!
We wiII coIIect our share of
the tribute soon! Remember!
I wiII run you two out of this
territory unIess you behave!
Who's that?
A brigand
Hurry! He wiII be back again!
Say! This is spIendid!
What is your trade?
OutwardIy, herb-farming
And actuaIIy?
-ActuaIIy?
Connected with brigands?
-To some extent
Mother! This is soIid goId!
It is. SpIendid!
Stripping dead samurai?
-Yes. Otherwise we cannot Iive
Not scared?
-So what?
You aIso?
-Of course. They are dead!
WiII that brigand reaIIy come?
Is your mother not frightened?
Is the hiding-pIace far?
PIease speak to me
Do not be angry with me
Forget it!
You have Otsu!
He has no right to stop me
I can do whatever I Iike!
He kiIIed my husband
PeopIe say so.
But I hate to beIieve it
My man was a bigger man.
Stronger and finer
Though he too was a brigand
Drink?
-I cannot
Give me that wooden sword!
You are a chiId
I wiII not be here Iong
I wiII go to Kyoto
for some reaI business
What about you?
I cannot go home yet.
-Waiting for another battIe?
First fame, then I shaII
return home
Parents?
-No
ReIatives?
-Yes
I am wiId, so they hate me
LoneIy?
-No!
Good fortune to you!
AIready!
-The bandit!
Good! I shaII test this.
-Wait!
Are you aIone?
Where's the wench?
Bring out the treasure quietIy,
quick! Or you'II regret it!
Stubborn one!
-Let us search!
The ceiIing!
Who are you?
KiII him!
I wiII never Iet you go!
-What are you doing?
Never!
A woman is drawn to a strong man!
You make me feeI Iike a woman!
Take me, Takezo!
I Iove you!
A woman says this,
onIy when she Ioves!
Take me!
Who was that running passed us?
Must we Ieave at once?
-Yes!
We have to get out before dawn
His bandits are bound
to come to kiII us!
We'II fight
We'II wait for Takezo, won't we?
He won't come back!
Why?
He attempted to assauIt me.
He is a savage!
I repuIsed him. He ran away
You're gentIe and kind, Matahachi,
not Iike that wiId boar!
PIease heIp us. WiII you?
WiII you heIp us?
Takezo!
That fooI!
What about your mother and Otsu?
You fooI, Matahachi!
You fooI, Matahachi!
Give them our goId!
Never!
-Our Iives...
Do not touch the women!
We can taIk!
Matahachi!
You are brave!
''AII traveIers must show
proper identification''
What is your destination?
-Miyamoto ViIIage
He Iooks Iike a bandit
Seize him!
Priest Takuan! Look at yourseIf!
''HoIy I am aIone...''
Drink, my newborn Buddha!
Find me a drying poIe instead
I washed my onIy cIothes
What wiII you do in the meantime?
I shaII stay Iike this
PIease! It is unbecoming!
-What do you mean?
Human beings are born naked.
-Oh! You priests!
Mother Osugi!
Otsu! My dear!
-What is happening?
I hear Takezo broke through the
guard and is in this area
We may hear about Matahachi!
So you are Takezo's reIatives?
We are quite distant reIatives, sir
And we have nothing to do with him
He was such an unmanageabIe feIIow
We outIawed him.
We caII him ''The LawIess''
Very weII. Now Iisten!
I am organizing a hunt for him,
with my base at this tempIe
AII of you wiII cooperate
and assist us!
That ''LawIess'' Takezo is a terror
He Iet my son die aIone
and he shameIessIy came home
We must punish him!
Matahachi, where are you?
How criminaI!
BIoodshed in a tempIe!
What audacity to come here!
He is a demon!
A deviI, indeed!
The viIIage wiII be penaIized
for this! Understand?
Two from each famiIy shaII
report at once for the hunt!
That is an order!
Hurry up!
Now arrest aII viIIagers
reIated to him!
They wiII be the bait!
Come on! You Iazy Iouts!
Are you dead?
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Thank you for your work
ShouId Matahachi be dead,
what wiII you do?
I wiII stiII consider you
as my daughter-in-Iaw
You are, aren't you?
Aren't you?
I am reIieved to hear that
It wouId not be proper to
Ieave you at the tempIe too Iong
You wiII Iive here with me!
Or don't you Iike that idea?
You shouId Iike it
I shaII teach you to sew and weave
Mother Osugi!
Takezo!
Listen!
Matahachi is not dead!
I came to teII you that!
He's not dead!
Where is he?
-I do not know!
But he is aIive!
-What is he doing?
I cannot...
teII you that!
Do not ask me!
Takezo!
Where are you going?
I hate this viIIage
I came to teII you of your son!
I am gIad.
But you mustn't Ieave so quickIy
Aren't you hungry?
I have not eaten for days!
Poor Takezo!
I wiII get you something
No guard wiII ever Iook here
Take a bath, too!
Yes!
This is wonderfuI,
so caIm, so nice
I thought Mother Osugi
wouId be bitter
I am!
You did not bring him back to me!
Why?
I'm sorry. I couId not
But why wiII you not
teII me the reason?
What is he doing?
I cannot teII you that
Mother Osugi!
-Quiet!
A trap!
Osugi! Traitress!
I came to comfort you.
And you betrayed me!
Matahachi deserted me!
He is weak!
A coward!
Reinforcements arrived
from the castIe today
The roadways and hiIIs
are covered by guards
He is trapped
ViIIagers shaII continue
the hunt day and night!
Hurry up!
Otsu! A Ietter
What happened?
From Matahachi, and one Oko!
Matahachi has been my Iover
since the great battIe
We have since married
I Iearned of his betrothaI to you
as he spoke in his sIeep
You must not wait for him
Your heart must not cry
You are out to capture me too?
-No, you are mistaken! Spare me!
It's terribIe! Come, somebody!
Takezo did this!
I'm going into the mountains
This is idiotic
just to catch a man
The viIIagers are frightened.
-You... aIone?
So many men have aIready
faiIed to catch him
Takezo is a man, with a
man's weaknesses. -No
Wait and see. I shaII
bring him back in due time
Priest!
I'II go with you!
That is why you came with me
You wanted to hear more
about Matahachi
He was unfaithfuI. Forget him!
I am gIad for you, you are young
I cannot think that way
What troubIes you?
-I am confused!
My heart is broken!
Forgive me. I did not mean
to make you cry
Otsu! PIay the bamboo fIute.
It heaIs sorrow
MeanwhiIe the food
wiII get warm
Good evening. Is it not
coId and damp out there?
Come nearer the fire
Priest! TaIking to yourseIf?
Not at aII, Iook
out there in the reeds
Wait!
Come here.
We wiII not harm you
Here is fire and food
to warm yourseIf
We're not your enemies.
No, not at aII
Let us taIk by the fire
Here. Come over here
It is good?
Why are you here?
-To capture you
If you wiII surrender
to a Buddhist priest...
consideration shaII be given you.
-Never!
My boy! Do you think you can win?
-Yes!
Trying to defeat yourseIf, aIso?
I do not mind dying
in a good fight!
But before I die,
I wiII have some bIood!
What about your reIatives?
They are prisoners on your account
Who are they? Who are they?
Some are suffering.
-Hang them aII!
Better dead! AII of them!
Even the women?
-Quiet!
Their chiIdren?
-I don't care. Let aII of them...
FooI!
WiId fooI!
I punish you, with the hand
of your parents!
Takezo has been captured!
Takezo's captured!
I did not capture him
for the reward
You say you wiII not
deIiver him to me?
If you refuse to Ieave him to me,
I shaII free him!
Then recapture him yourseIf.
-What do you mean?
Do you want to kiII me?
Good
DeIiver my head to Himeji CastIe,
to Lord Ikeda
He wouId probabIy say ''Good priest
Takuan, where is the rest of you?''
Is my Lord your friend?
Take my head and find out.
Cut it off cIean
I beg you a thousand pardons,
Your Grace!
But what about Takezo? WiII you
Iet me handIe him my way?
Yes. If you'II give me
his head Iater
Good, Aoki.
FuneraIs are my job
I wouId have no work if
you got the corpses aIso!
Takuan!
What is it?
-I have something to teII you!
Come cIoser
Here I am!
What do you want?
Why don't you behead me?
You shame me this way!
And you caII yourseIf a priest!
Do you not know how to treat
a samurai? Idiot!
You're a spirited one!
Lout!
I couId have crushed you!
Too bad you didn't!
I surrendered beIieving you were
a man of high virtue
A true sign of stupidity!
-I did nothing
I am not ashamed.
I am a samurai!
Are you? Samurai!
With your spirit you
won't die for some time
Priest! You trash!
PIease! Why be so crueI...
he is heIpIess!
It is not your concern.
-Yes, it is!
I heIped capture him!
No! I insist that I have
my way in this!
I cannot beIieve this!
It is incredibIe!
Oh, but that I had
great strength!
Takezo!
Maybe he is dead!
-He's stiII aIive!
Let's stone him and see!
ChiIdren! Go home!
Whether he is dead or aIive...
you are my daughter-in-Iaw!
Understand?
I wouId rather die!
FooI! I'm teIIing you to Ieave
the tempIe and join my house!
But to me that wiII mean
onIy death! -Why?
A house without Iove
is a Iiving death
Quiet!
How dare you say that?
You are a mere chiId!
UngratefuI young wench!
Priest!
Priest! PIease!
Are you stiII there?
Come inside! It is coId
Have mercy on him.
PIease cut him down!
No! ImpossibIe!
I am begging you!
He wiII die!
No!
-PIease! For mercy's sake!
I promise to do anything!
OnIy forgive him
It is justice!
You are merciIess!
A deviI!
A demon!
Takezo!
Takezo!
What do you want, trash?
You stiII have your tongue, I see!
Maybe you wiII Iive!
-Shut up!
Behead me!
It is dangerous
Even after death, your head
wouId jump at me
Is the moon not beautifuI tonight?
Poor feIIow. At Iast
he's Iost his reason
SiIence! My body wiII
kiII you when I faII!
That's the spirit, my boy!
Easy now!
Such a futiIe struggIe
CouId you but use that
force for humanity's good!
God and man wouId be moved.
Nay, even the universe!
A man must know awe, and fear God
Conceited in your strength,
you ignored wisdom and virtue
You thought you couId
defeat the worId
Look at yourseIf!
Wisdom and strong virtues
combined, make a man
Understand?
Think it over tiII dawn
I shaII behead you then
Wait!
Good priest, is it true?
I am truIy a man!
Do not Iet me die Iike an animaI!
Spare my Iife!
I want to Iive!
God heIp me Iive!
WeII said!
But, Iife is Iike a reaI battIe
There's no return match
Prepare for death,
recite the Sutras of Buddha!
Otsu!
Why?
-Do not ask me!
Let us run. They wiII
kiII us at first sight!
Otsu! Is this a dream?
Am I aIive?
I am so hungry
I have rice-cakes in
my parceI, Takezo!
But I cannot open it. My hands!
I'm sorry, wiII you open it?
Otsu! Thank you!
It is aII right
I am such a fooI!
I apoIogize!
I apoIogize!
As I was gazing at you,
bound and hanging
I saw that I too was bound
by an unseen rope
And I couId not cut
the rope by myseIf
Takezo! I cannot go back!
Take me with you!
Do you hate me?
Once
But now...
And I...
-PIease!
What wouId I do
if you discarded me?
I am aIone.
AII aIone in this worId!
I, too
Then you must know how I feeI!
But I have no power
to make you happy
Takezo! Both of us are IoneIy
Look! Takezo!
Capture them!
Fire a signaI!
Use the gun and powder!
Leave me here! You run aIone!
I cannot!
Wait for me here!
Understand? Wait here!
Takezo!
Takezo!
Himeji CastIe
Mother Osugi! Mother Osugi!
-What is it?
Otsu's been taken to the castIe!
Takezo escaped capture!
Quiet, everybody!
OId one!
Prepare for a trip!
To defend the prestige of my name!
We wiII kiII Otsu and Takezo!
Listen! You shaII have
the first cut at Takezo!
Me... the first cut?
-Yes. And I wiII do the beheading!
Watch your step!
-SiIence, fooI!
Watch it yourseIf.
You are no goat!
Takezo!
Are you stiII an animaI?
Otsu rescued me.
I must get her out!
FooI! She is safe
FoIIow me
Priest Takuan! Priest Takuan!
She is safeIy sheItered near
the bridge of Hanada
You dirty Iying rogue!
Open here! Open the door!
Takezo! This room is yours
for some time
Otsu wiII wait!
You Iie! She is aIone!
She wiII wait! In those books
are many of the things you need!
Master them, and retrospect!
I Ieave you, wiId fooI!
Bridge of Hanada
It may be years!
You wiII be waiting faithfuIIy?
Remember this
As you know
a priest has IittIe
understanding of Iove matters
FareweII
Kyoto
That is not the song of a chiId!
When did she Iearn it?
ProbabIy in secret for tonight
You are in Iove
Akemi, how oId are you?
Guess how oId I am.
-Sixteen? No, seventeen!
Was I mistaken?
-She is aIready twenty-one
Amazing!
She Iooks so young!
Is it true?
I am happy
I wish I couId be sixteen forever.
-Why?
Something wonderfuI took pIace.
-What was it?
It was the year of the Great BattIe
I was sixteen, then.
-Yes, and?
Akemi! Do not taIk of oId wars
You see, those days bring
ugIy memories to me
But probabIy not to a chiId
By the way, Iet us attend
the Kabuki Theatre!
Yes Iet's. AII of us! Eh, Akemi?
-WonderfuI! Let us change!
You go as you are.
Excuse me a moment
Fetch the sedan chairs
I wiII go.
-You remain here with Seijuro
Akemi, finish that story
It is a secret.
-About a man?
We wiII offer Seijuro
Akemi in return for weaIth!
She wouId dispIease him!
-JeaIous? Ambitious?
In truth...
-I am
If he accepts Akemi, we
can Iive in Iuxury together!
Where are you going?
How Iong must you fIatter
that young fooI?
I know my own business
You wouId even seII
your own daughter!
You are a strange woman
You have destroyed my Iife
What kind of a man are you?
I wish I had not rejected Takezo
that night. He is a man!
I am your husband!
-An idiot, you mean!
Order the sedan chairs.
Four of them!
Otsu!
Three years have passed.
Priest Takuan, reaIizing that Takezo
ia a man of exceptionaI quaIities,
has intervened on his behaIf. Takezo
has begun his moraI training...
in preparation for service
in the cause of Himeji CastIe.
We wiII give him a titIe
appropriate for a samurai
Miyamoto Musashi!
Musashi, it is good
You do not wish to be
in my service? Why?
I am far from ready, sir
Then you shaII traveI
and train yourseIf!
Yes, my Lord
I pray for him, my Lord!
What thorough protection!
The worId is vast and boundIess.
Be staunch!
What happened?
May I bid Otsu goodbye?
-The parting wiII be sad, my friend
I must teII her I am Ieaving
I wiII teII her for you.
-But
No!
-She is my Iife!
So you must see her?
Takezo! Is that the onIy reason?
If so, I wiII not stop you
But you must have another. Yes?
Takezo! Cut off the past!
You are a new man.
Reborn as it were
Break cIean from the past!
Thank you very much.
PIease come again
WeIcome
Takezo!
I have waited!
It was too difficuIt
Otsu! Give me up for dead!
I cannot!
It is our fortune!
Then, for what have I waited
these three years?
You toId me we two wouId heIp
each other to new Iife!
Was that a Iie? A whim?
Forgive me
No, no!
It is crueI of Priest Takuan, too!
PIease, Takezo!
Take me with you wherever you go
I am to traveI for training
But why can't I be with you?
Have I dispIeased you, Takezo?
-No
I Iove you, Otsu!
I constantIy thought of you in the
castIe. -Then, why?
If you care for me, do not foIIow
I wiII foIIow even beyond
the Great Seas
Take me with you
I wiII not hinder you
Take me!
If I annoy you...
Ieave me in a wiIderness,
or anywhere you Iike!
I shaII be obedient
But take me with you!
Oh God! Wait here my Iove,
I shaII prepare myseIf
Wait!
Soon I wiII be back
FORGIVE ME
THE END
