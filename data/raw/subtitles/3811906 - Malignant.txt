So, it's becoming more apparent
that not only is Gabriel
getting stronger,
he's becoming more malicious.
If his strength and ability
continue to grow at this rate,
we will no longer
be able to contain him.
However, I am
still determined...
 Dr. Weaver,
he got out again.
How far did he get this time?
He made it all the way
to the records room
before we got to him.
He found his information.
He wants to go home.
Dr. Fields, what the hell
is happening?
I tried to subdue him with ECT,
but electroshock
had no effect on him.
Then all the machines
started going crazy.
It was like he was
drinking the electricity
and controlling our machines.
Dr. Plume.
No, please, don't.
He'll kill you.
Stand aside.
Take him down now.
Strap him into the chair.
You've been a bad,
bad boy, Gabriel.
I will kill you all.
Oh, my God. He speaks.
He's broadcasting his thoughts.
I thought we could help him,
but I was wrong.
It's time
we cut out the cancer.
 Frankie is trying
to get to Chavez.
He's trying to get his arms up
to protect himself,
but he can't get any leverage.
Hey, sugar, I thought
you were on the late shift.
I was, but dumpling's been
giving me a really hard time.
What do you mean, "a hard time"?
I don't know.
She's just a little more
agitated than usual.
Do we have any Tylenol?
They say I can't take aspirin.
You know, if you've
got all this pain,
maybe you shouldn't
be going to work.
I'll be fine.
I promise.
Hey, I was watching that.
Please, Derek, I really
need to get some rest.
No, maybe you need
to stop getting pregnant.
Derek, please. I just
really need to lie down.
You know the doctor said
this could happen again, right?
You know that.
How many times
do I have to watch
my children die inside of you?
Just stop.
You're breaking my heart,
Maddy. I swear to God.
You can't keep doing this.
Doing what?
Doing what, Madison?
Tell me what I'm doing, huh?
Tell me what I'm doing.
Are you saying this is my fault?
Are you saying this keeps
happening because of...
Don't touch her!
You bitch!
Oh, shit.
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna get you
some ice, okay?
Okay, I'm gonna get
you some ice. Hold on.
Babe,
I'm sorry that happened,
that, uh...
Sometimes it's like
I can't control myself, okay?
But that's not me, that...
You know, I'm trying,
and I've given up drinking,
and I'm gonna continue
to do better
for you and the baby, okay?
Maddy? Please.
It was an accident, Maddy.
Maddy?
What?
Madison?
 It cannot be!
 ...grabbed
a steel blade.
 ...has possession
of the puck down...
 ...just now
crossed paths out of...
Help me.
Derek?
Morning, Reg.
Morning? It's 4 a.m.
Night's not even over yet.
- Detectives.
- Officer Lee,
what happened here?
Home invasion.
Neighbors heard screaming
and called it in.
Any sign
of forced entry?
Not that we've seen.
- Where's the wife?
- Already at the hospital.
We found her unconscious
in the nursery.
Uh-oh, here comes
Miss Lonely-heart.
- Hey, Kekoa.
- Winnie, how bad is it?
I've never seen anything
quite like it.
Maybe from a vehicular
accident, but not this.
This is something special.
Holy shit.
Sydney?
Hi. Hi.
Where am I?
What... What happened?
It's okay.
You're in a hospital.
Where's Derek?
Do you remember what happened?
Someone broke into your house.
You were attacked, and Derek...
I was...
- Just... Just rest.
- I was...
I was so scared.
Scared for my baby.
Where is she?
Where is she, Syd?
Where is she?
I'm so sorry, Maddy.
They couldn't save her.
No.
No, no, no. No. No.
It's okay.
No! Please, no.
No!
Hey, okay.
No!
Mrs. Mitchell?
Mrs. Mitchell,
I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to ask you
a few questions.
Mrs. Mitchell?
Can I help you
with something?
Uh, I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.
Oh, I'm Sydney Lake.
I'm Madison's sister.
So, can I help you?
Oh, this.
Um, I'm a...
a princess at Family Planet.
So, I'm on my lunch break,
and I thought I'd come by
and check on Maddy.
She's been like this
for two days.
I can't even get her to eat.
Well, maybe
you can help me then.
Did you know of anyone
who wanted
to hurt your sister
or her husband?
There's no sign
of forced entry at the house.
May have been
somebody they knew.
Somebody with access.
I wouldn't know.
Derek kept us apart.
This isn't her first, right?
The doctor said your sister
had three miscarriages
in the last two years.
Oh, my God.
Um, I didn't know.
I don't know why
she wouldn't have told me.
Maddy...
If there's anything,
just give me a call.
Yeah. Thank you.
Keh,
you'll get a kick out of this.
No fingerprints, but all the
hand patterns are upside down.
Like our perp was hanging
from the ceiling.
That line up with anything
from forensics?
No footprints on the ceiling,
if that's what you mean.
But I spoke to the neighbors,
and more than one of them said
that Mr. Mitchell used to
knock Mrs. Mitchell around.
He beat her?
No forced entry,
an abusive husband.
Motive.
Please let me stay
with you for a few days.
I can blow off work,
and a few auditions.
It's not like I'm booking
anything anyway.
It felt so real this time.
I just...
I just couldn't do enough
to protect her.
You don't have to
stay here, you know.
I know,
but this is my home,
and I'm not gonna let it be
taken away from me too.
I'll be fine, I promise.
There's nobody there.
There's no one there.
It's all in my head.
It's all in my head.
There's no one there.
It's all in my...
It's all in my head.
Oh, my God.
Hey, are you gonna let me in?
Jesus, Sydney,
what are you doing?
Okay. My key wasn't
working and you weren't...
Oh, God.
You weren't answering.
I thought something was wrong,
I was worried.
Thanks.
Oh, I, um, installed deadbolts.
That makes so much sense.
Well, okay.
Mom made a casserole.
I could not climb with it,
so it is outside, but,
um...
You okay?
Derek did that.
He smashed my head
against the wall.
What?
I'm so sorry, Maddy.
Nobody deserves to die that way,
but seriously, fuck him.
You deserve so much better.
I thought about it a lot,
about leaving him.
By the time I got the courage,
I got pregnant.
Now, if only I'd been able
to have a baby.
Don't do that.
This is not your fault.
That's not what I'm saying.
I wanted to know
what it felt like
to have a blood connection
with someone.
A biological connection.
Maddy, what are
you talking about?
Shit.
Mom and Dad took me in
when I was eight.
I don't remember
anything before that.
Mom told me that my biological
mother died during my birth.
Sydney, I'm adopted.
Welcome to
the Seattle Underground.
No, folks, this is not
a historical tour
of Nirvana or Pearl Jam.
This is a tour of old Seattle,
buried underneath here
like a time capsule
of a bygone era.
All this used to be
at street level
where the people worked
and lived.
But after the great fire
of 1889,
they decided to rebuild
the new city
on top of the old city.
One story higher
to stave off flooding.
You can still see
the cobblestone streets
and the storefronts down here.
And there are rumors of
passages stretching for miles.
Some say the ghosts of the past
still haunt these tunnels.
Ooh.
Thank you.
Thank you. Have a good night.
We're closed.
You can't be down here.
Hello?
I can't tell you
how long
I've waited for this.
But not yet.
First,
Dr. Weaver.
Hello?
Hello?
-  Dr. Weaver.
- Yes?
 It's time
to cut out the cancer.
What?
Hello?
I'm sorry, who is this?
Hello?
Shit.
What are you doing in my house?
This is my house!
Who are you?
I can't move.
What's happening?
What do you want? Who are you?
No! No!
Time to cut out the cancer.
Oh, God.
No. It's not possible.
No.
Oh, God.
What do you want from me?
 To show you
what the cancer has become.
Hey.
So, housekeeper found our vic.
Dr. Florence Weaver.
Tough old bird,
but she fought until the end.
What you got, Winnie?
He killed her
with one of her trophies.
We just got the base.
The top half is missing.
The brutality seems consistent
with our other corpse.
- Same guy?
- That would be my bet.
We need to find
that missing half.
Yeah, don't we all.
What you got?
Dr. Weaver specialized in
child reconstructive surgery.
She kept journals
on all her patients.
Bag all these books.
I want them back
at the precinct.
Yes, sir.
What, are you gonna
go through all of them?
We're gonna go through
all of them.
Hey, did you find the rest
of that murder weapon yet?
 Don't even try.
Breaking news this hour,
as police are reporting the body
of Dr. Florence Weaver...
...was found brutally murdered
in her Washington Park home
this morning.
The grisly discovery was made
by the housekeeper
at approximately
8:30 this morning.
Did you know her?
No. No.
But I saw her die.
I don't know how.
I was doing laundry and...
and I saw him killing her.
It was him. It was him.
Him? Him, like the guy
that attacked you?
Yes.
He was here in the...
No, no.
I saw him murdering her
in her house.
And it was like I was there
and here at the same time.
It was... It was...
What is happening to me, Syd?
Okay, okay.
It'll be okay. We're gonna
figure it out, okay?
Ooh.
That's it. I'm out.
I read about one more sick kid,
my brain's gonna
push out my eyeballs.
- Good night.
- Tell Marcus it's my fault.
I'll make up for date night.
You better.
He's pissed.
Jesus.
- Yo, Basco, you here?
- No.
I thought I was the only
good-looking guy here
working late.
Got this case. Strange one.
Can you age that up?
How old do you need?
30 years.
I know, I know.
But who would kill her, John?
Let alone mutilate her
like that?
I know, I haven't spoken
with her in years,
but the person I knew, all she
ever did was help people.
Don't bring up Simion.
That was a different time.
Hello? John?
Hmm.
Maddy? Maddy. Maddy.
Hey, what's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong?
- He's here. He's here.
- Who? Who?
There's no one here.
Look at me, there's no one here.
You were just dreaming.
Come here.
Shit, Maddy, you're bleeding.
I wasn't dreaming.
I saw him. I saw him.
He killed again,
but this time I saw his face.
I saw... I saw his face.
Somehow
I'm seeing his murders,
like he's showing them to me.
What do you mean?
He's sending you videos?
No, goddamn it. I see them
as they're happening.
Like I'm having visions.
I know how that sounds.
Okay, maybe, when the killer
attacked Madison,
they formed,
like, some kind of, um,
like a... a psychic bond.
I mean, you guys
consult psychics for, like,
missing persons cases, right?
No, we don't.
I played a psychic
in an episode of a cop show,
and they said it's a real thing.
Are we really having
this conversation?
Okay, Madison,
what exactly did you see?
He killed again.
This time, across from
the Silvercup apartments
in North Beacon Hill.
- I Googled it.
- Great.
Wikipedia Brown here
just solved the case.
Listen, Madison saw
Dr. Weaver die as it happened,
and now she says she's seen
this one, so let's go look.
If she's wrong, you can
have her committed,
and you can put the cuffs on me.
There it is. Silvercup.
I think it's this one.
Which one?
So what, are we gonna knock
on every door now?
It's the top floor.
We could help.
Yeah, we don't need your help.
Could you keep an eye
on these two?
Come on, Keh.
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
What?
I see you.
What? They gave us a lead.
Cute little actress
throw you a ball,
and you gone chasing like a dog.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Hello? Anybody home?
This is the police.
If anybody's here,
you need to let us know.
Keh. Keh!
So I'm putting out a BOLO
on Sloth from The Goonies?
- You okay? Okay.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Reg...
Um, you wanna take a seat
while she... while you wait?
Oh, yeah.
Hello?
 Hello, Emily.
My name is Madison.
 Your fake mother
gave you the name Madison.
Your shitty marriage
gave you the name Mitchell.
But you'll always
be Emily to me.
Who are you?
 You know who I am.
Even if they say
I'm only in your head.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You let them tell you
I wasn't real,
that I was just a voice.
And you believed them.
Now, I'm going to make
them pay for what they did.
One by one.
Gabriel, no!
See?
- Deep down...
- Please.
- ... you've always known.
- Please.
Please stop. Please.
 Oh, we are
just getting started.
Uh, Detective,
if we're done here,
- we're leaving. Thank you.
- Um...
Okay. All right, well, I'm...
I'll see you around, okay?
Hey, hey, hey,
you finish aging that photo?
Yeah, I left it on your desk.
You saw it, right?
That's why you brought her in.
- Brought who in?
- The girl in the picture.
Yeesh.
Ah, hell.
She was the doctor's patient.
What? We've gotta turn around
and tell Kekoa.
We can trace the call.
The cops think I did it.
Well, this will
prove them wrong.
His name is Gabriel.
I don't know how I knew,
but talking to him, I just did.
He's someone from my past.
From before I could remember.
Where are we going?
Oh, Maddy.
Maddy.
- I just had to see you.
- Oh.
How are you holding up,
sweetie, hmm? Are you eating?
You look skinny.
I gotta cook more.
Mom, I need you to remember.
During the adoption,
did they say
if I had a brother or anything?
No.
The only thing they would say
is if there were siblings,
they try to place them
in the same family.
Then who the hell is Gabriel?
Mom?
Mom, what do you know?
You wanted a party
so bad, Maddy,
you nagged us
until your father gave in.
We invited
your whole class but...
They thought I was a freak.
I had no friends.
I remember that.
Blow it out, blow it out,
blow it out.
 For nine wishes.
 Those look good.
Looks good.
Stop saying that.
They are.
Maddy, who are you talking to?
No one.
 Maddy? Maddy,
what did we say about lying?
I wasn't.
Well, then
who were you talking to?
Gabriel.
Is he your imaginary friend?
Gabriel isn't made up.
He says that you are.
He says you're not
my real family.
- This is the nightmare that...
- Okay.
Ooh, that's a kick.
 Ooh.
My little Christmas cutie
right here.
- Go get her ready for bed.
- Okay.
Maddy, playtime's over.
Santa won't come down the
chimney if you're still up.
Mommy said she'd love me
when the baby comes.
She said nothing would change.
I won't.
You can't make me.
Please don't hurt the baby.
 Maddy? What's going on?
Nothing, Daddy.
Some of the conversations
you had with Gabriel
just chilled us to the bone.
Wait, so Gabriel was something
that I made up?
Whatever you went through
before you joined our family,
it hurt you in a way
that I can't even imagine.
I always figured
you created Gabriel
so that you could survive that.
We thought if we
gave you enough love,
you wouldn't need him anymore.
I hope we weren't wrong.
E. May...
Thursday, July 23rd, 1992.
Today marks the seventh year
since Emily May
was entrusted into our care.
She remains unlike
any test subject
we have ever encountered
here at the clinic.
Though in recent months,
Emily started
exhibiting signs
of mental psychosis.
She says she's seeing visions,
and hearing thoughts
from the Devil.
I've contacted Dr. John
Gregory out at Hopkins
as well as Dr. Victor Fields
from the Los Angeles
Children's Hospital,
just to help determine
a course of action.
Dr. Florence Weaver.
Dr. Victor Fields.
Working the same case
along with Dr. John Gregory.
Holy shit.
Dr. Gregory?
This is Seattle PD.
I need you to answer me.
Detective!
He's still here.
He's still here.
Oh, Jesus.
Holy shit.
I gotta be
out of my mind.
Stop!
Fuck me.
All three victims
were involved
in the same case study
they called Patient May.
You were the case study.
They were your doctors.
Uh, I'm sorry.
It's all blank before
Sydney's parents adopted me.
I think you were born Emily May.
That's what he calls me.
Madison,
the department works
with a hypnotherapist
that helps unlock
repressed memories.
Trauma, sexual abuse, PTSD.
Would you be willing to see one?
I knew it.
She's not a psychic,
God damn it.
 We are gonna
turn back the hands of time.
The bygone years
reconstructing themselves.
I want you to go back
to before the adoption.
I think I'm in a hospital.
But I don't remember any of it.
Okay, you've gone back
beyond your conscious memories.
Can you tell us why
you're in the hospital?
I'm not sure.
But I'm better now.
That's why they're here for me.
- Who?
- My new parents.
They've come to take me
to my new home.
It's nice.
But he's here too.
Gabriel.
He followed me home
from the hospital.
Who is Gabriel?
Is he a friend?
He says he is, but I'm the
only one that can see him.
You ruined
your mother's cake.
- I didn't, it was Gabriel.
- Stop.
You can't keep lying
like this, Maddy.
- I'm not lying.
- There's no Gabriel.
Go to your room. Madison,
go to your room right now.
 So when
he does something bad,
I'm the one
that gets in trouble.
Go away.
What?
But she's sleeping.
I guess.
Really? You mean
like a good surprise?
 Cut it.
A nice slice of cake for Mom.
Madison!
 Cut her!
No,
it wasn't me! It was Gabriel!
Please! No, no!
Please believe me!
Please!
Stop this. Stop this.
Stop this!
Get her out, get her out!
Get her out!
- Stop this. Stop this.
- Beverly...
- Beverly!
- Get her out right now!
When I touch your forehead,
you will be back with us.
Hey. Okay?
Maddy?
Jesus.
Are you okay?
I remember now.
It's happened before,
waking up in strange places,
seeing things.
I don't know how,
but Gabriel wanted to...
What did he want, Madison?
To hurt the baby.
It's as if he knew
that with you here...
I wouldn't need him anymore.
And he was right.
He became a lost memory,
buried deep in the back
of my head...
until now.
The killer said he was Gabriel.
My Gabriel.
Wait, are you saying
that the killer is
your imaginary friend?
Whoa!
Fuck!
Everything's
gonna be okay.
Maddy? Maddy, listen.
Wait. Please.
Detective, wait. Please.
I don't know what's going on,
but Maddy couldn't
have done this.
You can't come back in here.
This is a crime scene now.
- Please just listen to me.
- No, you listen.
Back off,
or I'm gonna charge you
with being an accomplice.
Please.
Hey, you guys gotta see this.
This is what he kills with.
It's the rest of
the missing trophy,
fashioned into a weapon.
I told you, from day one.
You got the murder weapon,
the coat, the gloves,
and Jeffrey Dahmer's workshop
in your attic.
It's over, Madison.
It was... It was Gabriel.
He got into my house.
He's done it before.
Enough with the bogeyman story.
Please, Kekoa. Please.
You've seen him.
You know that it's not me.
- Who is the woman, Madison?
- I don't know.
Gabriel must have snuck her
into my house.
Let me
tell you what I think.
You were sick in the head
when you were young.
Those doctors helped you.
It worked for a while.
But now your sickness is back
and you blame them
for fucking you up.
No. No.
It's not me.
Stop lying to us.
I'm telling the fucking truth!
Shit!
He wants to talk to you.
You have got to be kidding me.
This is Detective Shaw.
 Hello, Detective.
Who am I talking to?
 You know who I am.
You found me.
I didn't find you soon enough.
But you found my things.
I want them back.
Why was your stuff
in her attic, hmm?
You trying to incriminate her?
Dumb bitch didn't even know
I was nesting in her home.
Is all this personal?
If my blade had punched a hole
in your face last night,
would that have been personal?
Who are you, Gabriel?
Oh, I thought she had
already told you.
I'm a figment
of her imagination.
Ask her what
she used to call me.
The Devil.
You see, Syd? That's why
we never throw anything out.
You never know when something
would come in handy.
Here.
Yes, we had an Emily May.
She was remanded to our care
by the Simion Research Hospital.
It says here they've been
shuttered since the 90s.
So it's just been
sitting there empty?
Sorry, I don't know.
That was before my time.
Whoa.
Records storage.
Basement Level.
Of course.
Please, Officer. Officer!
I'm not supposed to be here!
I haven't done anything wrong!
I am not supposed to be here,
God damn it!
They made a mistake.
Princess.
Emily May.
"...the result
of an absorption in utero,
"growing in sync
with patient..."
Today, we'll be speaking
to the subjects' mother,
Serena May.
15 years of age.
Poor girl was raped and
carried her pregnancy to term.
She's decided to entrust
her children to our care.
This could be
a phenomenal opportunity
to further our research.
Now, are you sure
you want to do this, Serena?
It's okay,
there's no judgment here.
Mama won't help me.
She called my pregnancy
a transgression against God.
I don't know how to look
after them on my own.
He's an abomination.
I don't know what else
to do, Doctor.
Please look after Emily.
{\an6} Don't worry.
You can have peace of mind
knowing we'll provide
the best medical care.
They told me that she died
while giving birth.
Those lying cock-knockers.
 Now,
we're just going to need you
and your mother
to sign some paperwork.
When will she wake up?
She's in a coma, Detective.
It's in God's hands.
Hey, you were right
about the Underground.
Jane Doe was a tour guide
down there.
Employee of the Month.
Serena May.
This is Madison's birth mother.
Emily, are you okay?
Are you scared?
Well, don't be.
He won't wake up, I promise.
I've given him a heavy sedative.
It's probably why
you're feeling sleepy too.
We just wanted
a private moment with you
without Gabriel listening in.
We've noticed in recent weeks
you've become more aggressive.
Can you tell us why?
He's been telling me
to do things.
Bad things.
To hurt people.
 Is that why
you attacked Bobby Fey?
But Bobby's twice your size.
Gabriel makes me strong.
He told me to kill Bobby.
 He actually
said those words?
Sometimes he speaks words...
and other times,
the words are in my head.
And then...
Then they aren't
really words anymore.
Just feelings.
But I knew what
he wanted me to do.
He pretends to be nice.
But he's the Devil.
 Okay.
I'm going to wake him up.
Why don't you come around
after I've injected him?
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
Oh, my God! Maddy!
So what exactly is Gabriel?
Gabriel is an extreme version
of a teratoma.
A tumor consisting of tissues,
hair, teeth, muscles, bones.
But more specifically,
in this case,
it's a parasitic twin.
When two embryos
develop in the womb
don't separate like they should,
one twin is dominant,
while the other
is underdeveloped.
It's not considered conjoined
because the underdeveloped twin
is dependent on the body
of the other.
Like a parasite,
Gabriel feeds off Emily.
What's the matter,
Pollyanna?
You get lost on the way
to the country club?
Look, I don't want any trouble.
I don't give a fuck
what you want.
An apple.
Pig.
A teddy bear.
We're starting to suspect
that Gabriel
can somehow access
the region to the brain
that process visual stimuli,
and make Emily see
what he wants her to see.
This would explain
her recent claims
of hallucinations
and waking dreams.
What the fuck
did you do to get in here?
Forget to separate
the recycling?
But I'm willing to play nice
for a price.
What you got?
Guard!
No! No!
Bitch.
Gabriel, stop it.
What the fuck?
Oh, shit.
Yo, this bitch
is having a seizure.
Because they literally
share the same brain,
I think he's able
to trick her mind
and make her think she's
living her life as usual.
Essentially, placing her
in a mental prison.
When in reality,
Gabriel has hijacked her body
and is using it himself.
It's time to cut out the cancer.
Gabriel's parasitic nature
has increased significantly
as he's now siphoning
more fluids and nutrients,
resulting in severe weight loss.
So Dr. Fields, Dr. Gregory,
and myself have concluded,
the only way to save Emily
is to excise the teratoma.
Now, Gabriel is conjoined
at the brain,
so full removal could kill Emily
or result in permanent
brain damage.
Course of action would be
to remove what we can
and suppress the rest
into her skull.
Let's close her up.
What the fuck?
Holy shit! Oh, God damn!
Get me outta here!
Guard!
Get the motherfuckin' guard!
Guard!
Hey! Open
the motherfuckin' door!
No!
Holy shit! Hey!
 Keh? Listen.
Gabriel is inside of Madison.
He's been using her
this whole time.
He's been controlling her body
like a puppet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Sydney, slow down.
You're not making any sense.
 I found
Madison's history.
She was born
with a parasitic twin.
Gabriel has been dormant
all of these years.
When Derek smashed
Madison's head
against the wall,
it woke Gabriel up.
Bitch!
Jeez, Sydney, that's insane.
Madison's birth mother is
still alive, Keh. They lied.
I know. She's the woman
who fell out of Madison's attic.
We sent her to Seattle Medical.
Are you kidding me?
We have to talk to her.
She's the only person
left alive who knows anything.
It's in the stairs, quick!
- It's coming from inside.
- Shit.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
Keh? Keh?
Fuck.
Oh, God.
Shit! We're getting shot at!
Stay back.
We need backup.
Send the National fucking Guard!
Madison!
Madison!
Get off him, motherfucker!
Fuck!
Oh, my God.
Okay. Fuck.
Told you not to get
your ass kicked.
Okay.
Regina.
Oh, my God, Kekoa!
Why am I calling the police?
Call paramedics. Now!
Oh, Reg...
Oh, my God.
The mother, she's going for her.
The hospital. You gotta go.
I'll stay with her. It's okay.
Paramedics are on the way.
I'll be fine. Now go stop him.
Go!
Sorry, ma'am,
this area is restricted.
Right, I know, Officer,
but if you could just call
Detective Kekoa Shaw,
then he can fill you in,
and just tell him
that Sydney Lake is here.
I'm sorry.
Nobody is allowed in here.
I cannot let you by unless
Detective Shaw is here with...
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Are you having a heart attack?
- My pacemaker.
- Okay.
It's burning.
- Please go get help.
- Okay.
Sydney!
 I was
saving you for last.
 She chose you...
...over me.
Her own flesh and blood.
I should have killed you
before you were born!
Gabriel, no!
Gabriel.
Please forgive me.
I should never have
given you away.
You were my son.
And I should have loved you
no matter what.
Emily!
No! No! No!
You're hurting her!
Sydney, get outta here!
 Go on.
- Madison?
- Shoot me!
Madison, I know you're in there.
 And kill her.
What did you do to my sister?
She's not your sister!
Sydney!
Maddy, please.
 She can't hear you.
Maddy, I know you can hear me.
You have to fight him.
 Madison's not home.
Madison, he killed your babies.
He was the cause
of your miscarriages.
He was feeding off
of your fetuses
to build himself back up.
Maddy, please, please come back.
 Goodbye, sis.
Gabriel, no!
 I wanted you to see...
No, Gabriel. Please.
...what you made me.
I'm so sorry.
 A monster.
 No, Gabriel.
You were always a monster.
 What?
What's happening?
Madison...
Now, I can do
all the mind tricks you can.
 No.
Not possible!
Did you forget
we share the same brain?
I didn't ask
to be tethered to you.
You don't deserve your body.
I can use it better than you.
Not anymore.
You don't get to control me
ever again.
It's over, Gabriel.
I'm taking it all back.
My mind, my body, my everything.
Now, you get to live
in a world that I create.
You can't lock me
in here forever.
You'll always be stuck with me.
Sooner or later I will get out.
I know, but next time
I'll be ready for you.
Maddy?
Maddy? Is that you?
Sydney, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna lift this off you.
No, it's too heavy.
It was always my body.
If he was strong enough
to do this, then so am I.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, stay with me. Hey.
Hey, look at me. Hey.
All my life, I've yearned
for a blood connection
with someone.
Yet in the end, it was right
in front of me all along.
Blood or not, you will
always be my sister.
And I will always love you.
