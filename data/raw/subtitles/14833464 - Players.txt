- [man 1] Ooh, fancy.
Right?
- [man 2] What's the play?
- [Bran] Spill and Swoop.
- [man 1] Paper airplane?
- [Bran] No.
[man 2] We play drunk,
spill a beer on her,
Bran swoops in with a napkin.
- The next round...
- [Bran] That could work.
[woman] Uh, this isn't
a hockey game, guys.
{\an8}[Bran] Okay, then what?
[man 2] Brit Brat?
- [Bran] Yes!
- [woman] Please no.
{\an8}[Bran mimicking Brit]
I could use my British accent.
{\an8}[man 2] Women love British accents.
{\an8}[Bran] My torch is in the boot

- [man 2] Yeah.
{\an8}[woman] This is why
I wanna disown you as a friend.

{\an8}- [man 2] We'd need the scarf.
- [woman] In my bag.
{\an8}- [Bran] Yes, coach!
- [woman] Won't work.
- It's bright pink.
- [man 1] So?
- [woman] That's not a bright pink woman.
- [Bran] Seriously?
{\an8}[woman] We're trying to win points,
not lose them.
{\an8}She's on a paid internship at MTV.
[man 2] That is incredibly specific.
I say we run out the clock,
box the other dudes out,
play Drip Drop till it closes.
- [Bran] Absolutely not.
- [woman] I don't have time.
[Bran] I want her now, not in six hours.
[woman] I got it. Fiji Fantasy.
[Bran] No, no.
We always have to leave after that.
- [man 1] Yeah. We just got our mai tais.

[woman] That girl's not from here.
Look at her.
{\an8}She's just having a weekend
in the big city,
{\an8}hoping she gets to go home
with some big old story to tell.
{\an8}[Bran] Wait,
how do you know she's a tourist?

- [Bran] Ugh, fine.
- [woman] Fiji Fantasy. Okay, here we go.
Ads, Little, you two post up by the door.
Brannagan, come with me.

- He did.
- [chuckles] Yeah.
In a clinical trial
for the Psych Department.
- A paid clinical trial.
- [chuckling] It's...
It's misleading is my point.
Nick is an adult, you know?
He... He has a photo of himself
with his parents framed
in the living room.
Do you know how many guys
I date that have a framed photo
of themselves with their parents?
[inhales] By your tone, I'm guessing zero?
Nick has dishes that match
and soap that smells like lavender
and, yeah, sandalwood,
and he has books for days.
Just thick books.
Mmm.
I like that.
The guys that I hook up with at the bars
and the clubs are just children.
- Do you know what my grandma said to me?
- [bike rattles]
She said that... that she was gonna die
before I got married.
- [gasps]
- [Adam] Oh.
- [pensive piano music continues]
- She... She might.
I'm 33, and I'm exhausted, and...
And I want an adult.
[pensive piano music continues]
Okay.
Okay?
You want this dude, let's get him.
Yes.
- Yeah.
- No take-backs.
We'll get that dick!
- [chuckles] Hold on.
- Yeah.
But we need to start planning this
because I don't think it's gonna be easy.
- [Adam] No.
- [Mack] No.
He is a fancy fucker, let me tell you.
- [Adam] He's so British.
- [Mack] He's so British.
- [Adam] Yeah. [laughing]
- [Mack] Oh my God.
- [jazz-funk music playing]
- They say it can't be done.
They say we shouldn't try.
Who's they?
But this team does not recognize
the word... "impossible."
- [Mack] Mmm.
- [Adam] We don't believe in limits.
[Mack] Mm-mm.
We will convert this one-night stand
Into a romance.
- I'm so hard for all of this right now.
- Me too.
- [Adam] You guys have broners right now?
- [Bran] I'm not into that.
Anyway, to do so,
we need pregame research.
Tape, data.
We need to work together
to get Mack the stats she needs
to call the right play for the win.
- [Mack] Mmm.
- Let's Moneyball this shit.
Nineties Brad, though.
- Oh God.
- Right?
Yummy on my tummy, right?
Little, you're unemployed.
You're on day shift.
[Little] Damn straight.
[Adam] Stake out his apartment.
Find out where he goes,
how he lives.
- [jazz-funk music continues]
- Brannagan, you're nights.
What's he do for fun?
Who's he seeing? Is it serious?
Flag any second dates.
Thirds require immediate intervention.
Forty bucks a cocktail?
- Uh, just a water.
- [bartender] Hmm.
[Adam] Mack, you go dark
till we've got this, all right?
Internet research only.
Interviews, mutual friends,
good old-fashioned online stalking.
{\an8}I'm on reading duty.
{\an8}Send me the data as you get it.
I'll work up a visual analysis,
and we shall reconvene.
You gonna finish that?
[annoyed] I'm always gonna finish that.

Nice to meet you.

Hey, um, can we use
this conference room for a sec?
- What about upstairs?
- [Adam] Uh, it's... it's full.
What about downstairs?
Also full.
What's all that?
Uh, it's for, uh, my feature.
- Who's the guy in the headband?
- [Mack, Adam, and Bran] Intern.
- Intern.
- Yeah.
- [Bran] Oh, thanks, Carl.
- [Mack] Thanks, Carl.
- [Adam] What a guy.
- [Bran] Such a good guy, Carl.
- Got your ruler.

All right. Oh.
- Oh.
- [Adam] All right.
- [Little] Takes a lot of pens.
- [footsteps receding]
- Okay, what do we got?
- We've got Nick Russel.
New York's most eligible bachelor,
celebrated foreign correspondent.
- He...
- Okay, could we just skip ahead a bit?
Right. Okay.
So, uh, here's what we know so far.
Um, we've got SNS
as the standard one-third of his day.
- SNS?
- Uh, sleeping and shitting.
- He shits a third of his day?
- [Adam] Moving along.
Almost six hours a day, six days a week,
he's either writing
or researching his book,
which is subdivided thusly,
library, Dumbo House,
East One Coffee Roasters.
- Oat milk flat white.
- Dumbo House?
Don't act like you wouldn't kill
your grandmother to get in Dumbo House.
- Yeah, 'cause she's a dick.
- Nana?
- She smells like cheese.
- Be glad your grandma smells like cheese.
Mine smells like casket
because she's dead.
We're talking about Nick here. All right?
Nick spends his Tuesdays at the Met,
Sundays with Bloody Marys.
His workout routine is jogging,
rowing, and yoga.
- Can we skip to my part?
- [Adam] Yes. Nights and weekends.
Nights and weekends, we've got concerts,
we've got wine tasting, fine dining,
Bib Gourmand picks.
- Socially, we're in a pretty good place.
- [Mack] Hmm.
Uh, he goes on a date
every seven to nine days.
A few repeats,
but only two have gone on a second date.
- Mmm.
- Though plenty make it to second base!
- [music stops]
- [imitates horn blaring]
- Sorry.
- [Adam] Um...
- [jazz-funk music continues]
- Goalposts. What're we aiming for?
- Well, Mack wants to land this guy, right?
- Yeah, but what constitutes a landing?
- [Adam] Mmm.
- I want a drawer.
A what?
I want him to empty out a drawer
so I can put my stuff in it.
- Come again?
- I've never had a drawer. It'd be nice.
- [Adam] A drawer?
- A drawer. Yeah.
Okay. Drawer. Weird, but I got it.
Drawer. Right.
Drawer. [chuckles]
- Thank you.
- How long does it take to get a drawer?
Couple of months.
Months? We're gonna be playing this dude
for a couple months? I have shit to do.
I just need you to get me
out of the one-night-stand category
and into the formal dating category.
- The hardest part.
- Yeah.
Deprogramming simple dude-brain
is like landing on the moon.
So it can be done.
- By astronauts.
- And very competent ground crew.
That is so true.
Dream work makes the team work.
- We need a play, guys. What do we got?
- Yes.
Um...
[music becomes quieter]
No.
[Mack] Hmm.
- I don't know. I got nothing.
- They're all just for hooking up.
Yeah. Yeah, so we're gonna need
to make some adjustments.
Let's just focus on the foundation first.
Crêpes Suzette.
Lactose intolerant.
- Wave Running Aqua Plane.
- Did you even look at the weakness chart?
- Look at the weakness chart.
- Weakness chart?
- It's right there.
- [Bran] Oh my God.
- [Little] There's the weakness chart.
- Whisky a Go Go.
- [chuckles] I tossed out those boots.
- No.
- Chemical Spill.
- Have to leave the country.
- Betsy Ross's Mother.
- I'd have to fake my own death.
- [quietly] I can help you with that.
- Do we not have a play?
[jazz flute whistles]
We've never played for keeps.
- [Mack] Oh! Oh.
- [Adam] Okay.
I feel like that shit hurt me.
What if you just ask him out?
- Huh?
- Told him you liked him.
Kind of like a... like a "no play" play.
[Mack snorts]
The "no play" play?
- Yeah.
- No. Are you serious right now?
- I was until you made that face.
- Which face?
The face you're making right now.
[chuckles]
No, I... I think that's suicide.
- How is that suicide?
- Because if you...
Oh God. 'Cause if the person
isn't on the exact same page
at the exact same moment as you are,
then you risk coming in too hot
and, shit, blowing it forever.
Forever seems a bit lofty...
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Whoa! Whoa! Hey.
- [Mack] Wow.
- [Adam] Jeez Louise.
No.
Come on, don't you agree?
That "no play" play is dangerous.
And with him? Oh my God.
[cheers over television]
It's... I don't know. Maybe.
- Oh. That's a pretty deep lock.
- [Mack] Nope.
- No, she's got one in. She's fine.
- [Adam] Where?
Next round, she gonna come in,
flurry of strikes.
Jab, jab, feint, dodge,
the guillotine again,
reel her in, take her down, and it's done.
Over. Finito.
- [chuckles]
- Wait for it.
[Adam] Like, literally,
her chin was in her ass.
Oh my God.
- [Adam] What?
- That's it.
That's it.
That... that... that... that's the play.
What's the play?
- That is the play.
- What's the play?
- Get your ass...
- Ow. Come on.
- That is the play!
- [Adam groans]
- [jazz-funk music playing]
- [Mack] It's new. It's called The Flurry.
We jab, duck, feint,
then land a spinning elbow knockout.
First, the jab.
We make brief contact.
Ring his bell a little bit.
Keep it casual and direct.
[jazz-funk music continues]
[Mack] He's got a reading
at McNally Jackson on the 17th.
That gives me eight days
to become a regular there.
- Excuse me.
- Hmm.
- Are you the owner?
- I am.
I'm Mackenzie.
I just have to say I love this place.
It is my home away from home.
- Aw. Mary. Thank you so much.
- Oh, of course.
- Um, I will go with this one.
- This is a favorite of mine.
- [Mack] Is it?
- Yes.
Anissa Gray.
[jazz-funk music intensifies]
- Mary, right?
- Yeah.
- Mackenzie.
- That's right.
Could you recommend traveling books
to most likely South Asia?
Mackenzie.
Have you finished that book already?
Loved it, Mary.
[Mary chuckles]
[Mack] Day of the reading, Little, Bran,
you'll cover the entrance
and text me when Nick arrives.
What are you wearing?
- We're on a stakeout.
- You look like a cheap leprechaun hooker.
Sorry, sex worker.
- I'm incognito.
- [Bran] What?
- Incognito?
- Oh, oh.
- Subject spotted 23 degrees south.
- Yeah, I see him. I'm not an idiot.
- [phone dings]
- [jazz-funk music continues]
- [doorbell ringing]
- [Mack] Mmm.
- So good seeing you again.
- [Mary] You too.
Mm-hmm. Take care.
- Oh!
- Oh. Sorry.
- Mackenzie. Hi.
- Nick.
[chuckles] What are you doing
in my bookstore?
Uh... well, I have, um...
I've got a reading tonight.
- Oh. Of what?
- [chuckles, whispering] Of my book.
Yes, sorry, of course.
I didn't know the new one came out.
No. Well, it's not my new one.
It's my last one, actually.
New one's still... [inhales deeply]
...very much in the works. But, um...
- I will put it on my list.
- [Nick chuckles]
- [Mack] Good luck tonight.
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks.
- Bye, Mary.
- See you next time, Mackenzie.
[jazz-funk music playing]
Hi, Mary.
- Good luck tonight, Mr. Russel.
- [Nick] Thank you.
[jazz-funk music intensifies]
[Little growls]
- Oh, oh, oh. Hey.
- [Bran] Yeah.
Oh, that's what we do. That's what we do.
Next, the duck. This one's easy.
He sees me, I pretend not to see him.
Adam, you have his jogging routes
mapped and timed, correct?
Yes. Page 14, figures 2A and B.
- [Mack] Hmm.
- Holy shit.
The two of you are on lookout again.
Adam, you're with me.
[jazz-funk music becomes quieter]
- You were right about the look.
- We look badass.
- We do. So fucking baller.
- Baller.
[Bran clears throat]
[jazz-funk music intensifies]
- [Bran] Eyes on the prize.
- [Little] Here we go.
Act normal. Act normal.
[Mack] Got it.
- Boobs okay?
- Yep. They're boobs.
[Nick] Hey. Mackenzie.
- Oh fuck. [sighs] Oh, fuck running.
- [Bran] Oh my God.
That was perfect.
Next, we have the rope-a-dope, the feint.
This one's, uh... We have a problem.
What?
- We need a woman.
- So ask one of your girlfriends.
- [indistinct conversations in the bar]
- I could.
Oh my God.
You don't have any female friends.
Becca moved to Jersey,
and Sapna's back in rehab, so...
It's really hard to make new friends
at this age.
[Bran] Mmm.
What about Ashley?
From the office?
The secretary Ashley.
Ashley with the... the smile.
[Adam] Wow, dude.
She seems competent.
Oh, Carl. My bad. Oh my goodness.
- Hey, Ashley.
- [Ashley] Hey.
What's up, Mack? Oh shit. What you need?
- [Mack] Hmm?
- Did we run out of string cheese?
Oh, I stole some of that last week.
We're good.
- You need a tampon, though. I got you.
- [Mack] Oh.
Super plus, plus.
I love free tampons.
But I'm actually here for you.
- We're all here for you.
- Stop.
[Adam] Uh, Mackenzie's trying to parlay
a one-night stand into a relationship,
which, um, has its difficulties.
It's Nick Russel, right?
You're very observant. She's observant.
I think this could work.
Yeah, I think so too.
Uh, we were actually hoping
that you would play a little game with us.
- I'm in.
- Oh.
I've always wanted to see
how old people date.
[Adam] Mmm.
I just use an app.
["We Out Here"
by Atomic Drum Assembly playing]
[indistinct conversations]
[Mack] This is the feint.
Next Sunday it's outdoor movie night
at Brooklyn Bridge Park.
Boys are running a zone defense,
dividing the lawn into three sections.
Scan the crowd, find Nick.
- [Ashley] And what exactly am I doing?
- [Mack] You're my ringer.
- Anyone got eyes?
- Negative.
- I got nothing.
- Nope.
["We Out Here" continues]
Oh, oh. I got him. I got him.
He's on the Furman Street side, and he's...
- Is it the bridge or the river?
- Shit. Um...
Bridge is the one... It goes over the water.
- The wet one's the river.
- Oh. Uh...
- River, bridge. Please, Little.
- Jeez...
- He's halfway to the waffle stand thing.
- [Mack gasps]
Game time. Yeah. Giddyup.
This play is a go. Get him.
["We Out Here" continues]
[Mack] Sorry. My bad.
- I have eyes. Go. You gotta move fast.
- [Adam] You won't make it.
- You're not gonna make it.
- [Mack] Come on, come on, come on!
Damn!
[man] Whoa, hey!
- Mackenzie.
- Huh?
[song ends]
- Do you...
- [Ashley belches] Hey.
You remember Ashley from the, uh, office?
- Oh, yes. Hello. Nice to see you again.
- [Ashley, slurred] Hello.
This is gonna be the best movie ever.
[laughing]
We've been here for a little while.
- Really? [chuckling]
- [Mack chuckling] Yeah.
- They have Wafels & Dinges.
- [Mack] What?
- You know they have Wafels & Dinges?
- [Mack] No.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Ash, careful.
[Ashley] It's really hot.
Sir, can I eat your dinges?
- [Nick] Does she know those people?
- No, and...
Yup. Yes, now she is eating
a stranger's dinges.
- Ugh.
- [Nick] Oh.
So, who did you come with? You here alone?
No. I'm meant to be meeting friends
but having a terrible time finding them.
- No reception?
- No, I had better service in Baghdad.
- [Ashley groans]
- Impressive.
Um...
How was your reading the other day?
Good. Yes, good, thank you.
I think, uh, nine people came.
So that makes me, you know,
officially impressive.
Stop. Too impressive.
Can't even handle it.
[chuckles]
Um...
You know, why don't you join us?
I mean, if you wanted to, you can join us.
- Yeah?
- [Mack] It's a small...
- [Ashley belches]
- ...um, blanket, but it is a...
Oh, Ash. Oh no.
- [intriguing music playing]
- [Ashley] I'm just sick.
- [vomiting]
- [Mack] Oh.
[woman] Shoo.
[Ashley groaning]
Hey, I don't...
- I don't feel very shiny.
- [Mack] I don't think so.
- We can go home. We should.
- [Ashley belches]
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, you're touching me.
- [Ashley] I can ride the train.
- [Mack] What is that?
- This is frosé.
- [Mack] Oh no.
And a little rosé. Is that...
- I had a beer.
- I'm gonna take her home.
- [Ashley belches]
- Hope to see you again.
- [Nick] Yeah. Feel better, Ashley.
- [Ashley belches]
- [Mack] Okay, right into the bushes.
- [Ashley vomiting]
Weird.
- [jazz-funk music playing]
- We clear.
- [laughing] Holy shit.
- [Adam] Wow.
She is a psychopath.
- Oh my God. Thank you.
- You're welcome. Clean yourself off.
You are amazing.
You are all of the amazing things.
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'm gonna leave.
- Appreciate you, Ash.
- Don't wanna see that.
[jazz-funk music continues]
- You maybe wanna...
- Yes.
- Cool.
- Yeah. Right now?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
[cheers in the stadium]
- [Adam] Alma mater?
- [Mack] Oxford.
- [Adam] Sun sign?
- [Mack] Pisces.
- Favorite liquor?
- Scotch.
- [Adam] Mmm.
- Mescal.
- Favorite food?
- Whole branzino.
Ooh, girl.
- [Mack] You ever had one of those?
- [Adam] Branzino?
- [Mack] Yeah.
- No. No. The eyes...
- They follow you.
- Yes.
- It's disgusting.
- I hate it.
Hey, whatever happened
to that, uh, number that you got?
Oh. Uh...
- We... we went out a couple times.
- More than once?
- It's nothing.
- [Mack] Who is she?
[Adam] No one yet.
No one.
Well, I hope she's great.
- [cheers continue]
- [PA announcer] That's a New York double!
- [Mack] Hey! I knew he was a good get.
- [Adam] Oh!
[chuckles] Do you remember that night game
when Brannagan slammed into you
trying to get that foul ball?
- It was in my hand.
- Literally.
Then that ten-year-old walked away with it
with the goddamn Baby Ruth in his mouth.
- I prefer Reggie! bars.
- I do too.
Do you know about that game?
Um, no, but I'm pretty sure
you're gonna tell me.
So Reggie takes it home for us
in '77, right?
[Adam] Mm-hmm.
Next season, opening game,
Reggie! bars debut.
Every fan gets one.
Then, bottom of the first, two on base,
Reggie's up to bat,
home run, because of course.
The part that I love so freaking much
is that to celebrate,
the fans threw their bars into the field,
and they had to delay the game
just to clean up all the chocolate.
- Shut up. Wow.
- [Mack] Swear to God.
That's... that's the game
that my parents met at.
And my mom got pissed at my dad
because he ate it
instead of throwing it onto the field.
Wait a minute. Wait.
So I know your parents met at a game.
- I didn't know they met at that game.
- [Mack] Because you're a terrible friend.
I talk too much. You don't listen
to a third of the things I say.
- [Adam] What's your name again?
- Oh, Mackenzie Cannon. I prefer Mack.
- [Adam] Nice to meet you. Yeah.
- [Mack] Lovely to meet you.
[Adam chuckles]
[sighs] My parents just...
They loved this place.
[emotional music playing]
- Do you remember how bad the roof leaked?
- Oh, flooded.
[Mack] Hmm.
The last game we saw together,
we actually sat right over there
by the, uh, old stadium wall.
- [Adam] Where the benches are?
- [Mack] Mm-hmm.
She was in a wheelchair by then.
[shakily] She died three days later.
Mack, come here.
[emotional music continues]
They tore the stadium down
the following year.
Just like that, it was all gone.
Oh, I miss her.
[softly] I know.
I miss them together.
You know, the way that my dad
would look at her.
Oh, I just... I want a love like that.
You know?
Yeah, me too.
- [fans cheering]
- [PA announcer] Home run!
[Adam and Mack] Yeah.
- [Adam] Yeah, baby.
- [Mack] Yankees, we love you! Whoo-whoo!
Oh my God.
Hmm.
Maybe that's the angle.
What?
I mean, I'm... I'm a fan. I am the OG fan.
- What are we talking about?
- My feature. My feature.
My parents. Um...
The first game, the last game, me.
I could just frame the whole thing
around us, you know?
And I can weave in the interviews,
and... and I can center it on Farkle,
if he'll ever talk to me.
But I could just make the whole thing
just a lot more personal.
- I love that. Yes.
- [Mack] Yeah?
- Yeah! Yes!
- Fucking got it.
[both vocalizing]
[upbeat funky music playing]
[woman] Basically, Jeff Syed was
the best-kept secret in the United States.
- He's just...
- Legendary player.
- Kitchen player.
- [phone dings]
He put me in the kitchen three times
in Brazil at the world championships.
- [phone dings rapidly]
- I'd just never seen Jonathan Schnapp make
that many errors in a row.
- It was just like one after another.
- [phone continues dinging]
You know, when you see a tampa,
a pilot, put up like that,
you've gotta go down suicide alley.
[man] Are you good? You okay?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
- [phone continues dinging]
[woman] He took Jeff Syed's disc,
and he tried to put it in the kitchen...
You know what? If you can give me, um...
We'll get back to the kitchen
when I put the biscuits in.
We'll grab it later, I guess?
- Red card!
- [Ashley] Code red!
What the fuck?
It's bloodred! Red. Red!
- What the hell are you doing here?
- [Bran] Code red.
- You weren't answering your messages.
- I'm at work.
Nick scheduled a third date.
- What? Who?
- Top Knot.
I knew it.
Anyone who can pull off a tan dress...
[Adam] Mm-hmm.
- When?
- Tonight.
- Tonight?
- [Adam] Yep.
- Classical music.
- Ugh. I know nothing about cellos.
- Also, it's totally sold out.
- You shut your mouth.
No. No, no, no. Third dates can't happen.
Third dates are make-it-or-break-it.
If it's a "make it,"
that's a six-month rain delay, at least.
[Bran and Adam] Yeah, we know.
- [Mack] Okay. All right.
- Facts.
We're gonna have to, um...
We're gonna have to force an incomplete.
- What if...
- [Bran clears throat] Mm-mm.
- But is...
- She's thinking.
- I just...
- No, see, like, we wait. She thinks.
- It's the whole thing.
- Well, Top Knot's a doctor, right?
["Like Wow" by BAYBE playing]
You are the MVP
that I have been waiting for.
- Oh, thank you.
- [Mack] Mm-hmm.
[softly] I'll call my guy in the hospital.
- [Mack] Mmm.
- Got a guy in the hospital?
- He's balls-deep in the hospital.
- Oh shit.
I'm confused. What are we doing?
["Like Wow" continues]
- Tell me things.
- [Adam] Tell you things. I got things.
All right, the Kronos Quartet
out of San Fran.
David Harrington's the founder.
- Two violinists, a viola, and a cello.
- [Mack] Mmm.
- I hate you, clasp.
- Viola, violin, what's the difference?
- Violin's bigger.
- Violin's smaller. I know my strings.
- Look down.
- Ninety seconds, folks.
[Little] I cannot believe
women do this by themselves.
- [Mack] Who's the conductor?
- I got it.
- Cue the hospital.
- [Bran] Hospital cued.
- [Adam] Quartets don't have conductors.
- Oh. How do they prevent the chaos?
- Nobody knows.
- The hospital just confirmed.
- Fun fact?
- They performed with David Bowie.
- No shit.
- Mm-hmm.
- [Little] Oh, oh, there she is.
- Oh.
- She doesn't know who we are. Yeah.
- She's never seen us before.
- [Adam] Cares about her job.
- [Little] Honorable.
- [Mack] I think her and I'd be friends.
- [Adam] I doubt that.
Intermission is in five, four,
three, two,

Go ahead.
[classical music playing]
[Mack] Two reds, please.
Okay, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were stalking me.
- [gasps] Me?
- [Nick chuckles]
Hi.
- Um, can I get you another drink?
- Oh, no. I'm good. Thank you.
Twenty-four.
So are you here with someone,
or are you just really thirsty?
[chuckling] Oh.
My brother. And he's just miserable.
- I should not have brought him.
- [Nick] Why?
Oh, he hates classical music.
- These guys are so good.
- [Mack] That's what I said.
[both] They played with Bowie.
- [Nick chuckles]
- That's what I said. It didn't work.
Yeah. So here's my peace offering to him.
How about you? You here with someone?
No, actually, she just, um...
she just had to leave for an emergency.
Oh, I hope everything's okay.
Oh, no, no, she's a doctor,
so these things happen.
- Yes. Saving lives. Big-time jobs.
- [Nick] Mmm.
[chuckles softly]
Well, um, do you want to...
I mean, if your brother's
having a terrible time,
do you wanna maybe spend the second half
with me? I've got great seats.
- Third row back, right in the middle.
- Can you see Harrington sweat?
Can you see Harrington sweat?
You can smell every pore.
Oh.
- Hold these, I'll text my brother.
- [Nick laughs]
- Thank you.
- [Nick] You're welcome.

[Bran] You keeping secrets from me?
Shame.
[Ashley laughs] That was good.
That was good.
There.
[Mack] Incredible that they do that

[Nick] I know, it's like some sort
of weird synergy.
- They're so in sync with each other.
- [Mack] Wild.

[Nick] Uh...
So... I mean, there's
a great mescal bar around the corner.
I can't.
I... I want to. I just have a deadline.
Of course. Right. [chuckles softly]
[jazz flute whistles]
Well, can I maybe see you again then?
I don't know, like, Tuesday? Dinner?
Proper date this time?
- Tuesday can work.
- Yeah?
[Mack] Mm-hmm.

Guys, this is Claire.
- Hi.
- [Mack and Ashley] Hey.
- [Little] Hi there.
- Hi.
Hi.
I've heard so much about all of you.
- Yes. Yeah, no.
- [Mack] Yeah.
- And we have also heard things.
- Things.
- Good things.
- I'm gonna get a beer.
- Oh, we have a pitcher. Grab a mug.
- I'll do that. I'll be back.
So she's the one who you said you got
her number all by yourself way back when?
Yes.
Um, why is my head exploding?
- Um, because I'm seeing someone?
- Like, multiple times?
Yeah, and you just, like,
randomly ran into each other?
- No, I invited her.
- [Little] Oh shit.
- Oh, wow, there it is.
- [Adam] You see that?
- [Mack] There was a part we didn't hear.
- Interesting move by you, isn't it?
Because that's not...
That's not allowed normally.
Why the visceral reaction?
You don't bring someone to the group
unless she's serious.
Oh.
Don't make that face.
That's not what happened.
- You got grandfathered in.
- No. No, no.
Because if we hadn't brought her in,
I would've brought her in.
[Bran] Oh, don't. Stop.
- So tell us more, Adam.
- She's cool, so I invited her here.
He never even mentioned this girl.
- [Mack] Woman.
- [Bran and Ashley] Woman.
He did actually mention her to me once.
But you invited her.
'Kay, I have got my glass. Ready to drink.

- [Little] Yeah.
- [Bran] Let's go get some beer.
- Uh, talk to me for a second, friend.
- Okay, friend.
Really quickly, uh,
she went from nothing to something.
- I feel like we missed a few steps.
- [chuckles] There were no steps jumped.
Uh, we had plans before the code red.
I didn't wanna cancel on her,
and I wanted to come celebrate with you,
so I invited her. I...
- I did exactly right.
- You did.
- [Adam] Right?
- Yeah.
- [Adam] Yeah.
- Look at you.
- Yeah.
- Who is she? What... what does she do?
She is a, um, dental hygienist.
- Mmm. Yeah. Oh right, thus the teeth.
- A lot of teeth conversations.
You like her.
[Adam] Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

- What? Come on.
- There it is.
We did that art prep for the original KO,

An adult relationship.
You take poops

They are very small poops.

Mmm. Yum. Should we just get
a bunch of stuff for us to share?
Yeah. Uh, we should do the lobster roll.
Oh, you know what?
Actually, we don't really do that, so...
- We don't do what?
- Wait. No, she's covering for me.
- I... I don't do that.
- Oh, eat shellfish?
Share food.
Because gluten?
- The foreign correspondence.
- I'm sorry, what?
Well, you know, when you report
on a lot of corrupt regimes like I have,
then, um, some people
try to poison you, so...
Are we a corrupt regime
on which you are reporting?
Why don't the, um, two of you share,
and Nick and I will just do our own thing?
- [Claire] Yeah.
- [Adam] No, that's smart. I like that.
- You can never be too careful.
- Yeah, exactly, so...
Well, to be fair, Mack didn't share
the first few years I knew her either.
Yeah, it was like an only-kid thing,
I guess. Total brat.
- Wow. I'm not a brat. You're a brat.
- [Adam] You little brat. You're a brat.
- [Mack] You know you're a brat.
- What about your brother?
[Mack] Huh?
Your... your brother at the concert.
Oh, yes.
That was, um...
- That was Charlie, right?
- Charlie, yes.
- You brought Charlie with you?
- Who else?
She brought Charlie with her. [chuckles]
Charlie is her Christian brother.
- Yeah, I see the confusion.
- So you brought a priest to the concert?
- [Adam] Not a priest. He's not a priest.
- No.
Hmm. That's a father.
He's a... It's a brother. You know?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It's like an old family friend.
- [Nick] Oh, right.
- From the neighborhood.
- Okay. [chuckles lightly]
Remember that Ping-Pong tournament
in your dad's basement?
Where Charlie came,
and he had the robes on?
- And he looked like Obi-Wan.

- Oh, stop.
- [Claire] Very exciting.
- What for?
- For humanitarian work, mainly.
- Mmm. Know what? That does add up.
- Now that you're saying that...
I hope I can finish my book by then
so I can enjoy the evening.
- You will. He's so close.
- Okay, what's the book about?
It's about the inevitable genocide
of the impending water crisis.

- Very fun.
- [Adam] Pretty heavy stuff.
- [waitress] Are we ready to order?

- Well, yeah, we're not sharing, so...
- Oh, right.
So I will get the whole branzino, please.
- Hmm. Same for me.

So I'm gonna...
We should get one of those too, for us.
Yeah. Can't wait.

So, Claire, I hear you guys
are going to the Met later.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, Adam's idea.
- [Mack] Sweet.
- I love the Met.
- [Nick] Oh, me too.
- Right?
- [Nick] Yeah.
There is this section
you have to visit. I swear...
Is anyone else
uncomfortable with the eyes?
Sorry.
Sorry, it's... it's... Yeah, it looks great.
- Yeah, I'm good.
- [Mack chuckles]
Anyway, like I was saying, um,
so the Byzantine art section...
Mmm.
Right? There is this piece
that it's just div...
It's like the eyes are following me.
Like, uh, one of those haunted house...
No, baby.
They're not looking at you. They're dead.
- You looking at them.
- [Adam] But they looking back.
- No. Okay.
- [Mack] Adam.
It's too much. [exhales]
Can they cut the heads off?
Adam, chill out.
It's just a sea bass, mate.
If you can't handle the eyes,
why are you eating fish at all?
- Oh, so you're enjoying it then?
- Oh yes.
- I love a whole branzino.
- Why don't you have a bite?
After I finish talking
about the Byzantine art section.
Uh, Mack, um,
Adam says you're writing a feature.
That's very cool. How's it going?
Did you get that, um... that Farber person?
- [Adam] Farkle.
- Farkle. But wait, about the Byzantine...
- You're writing a feature?
- Who exactly is Farkle?
- [Adam] Farkle is a Giants fan.
- Yeah.
- Oh, I love football.
- Oh, it's baseball.
- [Nick] What's the piece?
- Why didn't you tell him?
- He writes about genocides.
- [Adam] So?
I'd love to hear about it.
- Yeah?
- [Nick] Yeah.
Mack is writing a piece that's profiling
New York fans'
most memorable sports moments,
and, uh, she's been trying
to get Bob Farkle for forever.
- I got him.
- You got him?
- Got him.
- [Adam] Shut the hell...
- You fucking got him?
- I got Bob Farkle.
You got Bob Farkle. [grunts]
He's never agreed to an interview once,
and I got him.
[Adam] You fucking got him.
[scatting] You got him.
- Do you mind filling us in? [chuckles]
- I am so sorry. That is... Apologies.
- We'll do the dance too.
- Um, so, Bob Farkle... [chuckles]
Bob Farkle is part of
the Giants Nostalgia Society.
And so it's like...
It's these old-timers that get together
and reminisce about the Polo Grounds.
- It's a stadium in Harlem.
- [Mack] Yes.
And, um, Farkle and his buddies
would always sneak into the stadium.
Like, they loved baseball,
but it'd be anything.
It'd be hockey or football
or midget racing.
I don't know
that you can say the "M" word.
You have to say
"little people" these days.
- It's a class of vehicle.
- No, the cars are the size... the midgets.
- The people driving are average size.
- My bad.
So, Farkle was there
for the Shot Heard 'Round the World.
- Uh, wait, the Revolutionary War?
- Franz Ferdinand.
- [Mack] Both are true.
- Uh, 1951 pennant.
Yes. New York Giants, Brooklyn Dodgers.
And it is arguably the most, uh,
famous moment in baseball history.
So I wanted to see
if it was his highlight.
- Was it?
- [Mack] No.
Actually, this is just the best,
it was Ernie Lombardi
chasing this kid, Lenny,
down the length of the field
because he called him fat.
- [Adam laughing]
- Isn't that adorable?
- [Adam] Oh my God.
- [Mack] That's his most memorable moment.
- I cannot believe you got him.
- [Mack] Yeah.
Eighty-eight years old,
he's never done an interview. I was like...
- When can I read it?
- I'd... I'd love to read it.
- Really?
- Mmm.
But you're so... I...
I mean, I... I know you're so super busy,
but I would love your thoughts on it.
It'd be a pleasure.
- I'll send it tonight.
- [Nick] Great.
- Have you tried this? It's delicious.
- [Mack] Not yet. I'll dig in.
I like to start with a salad.
How about you, Adam?
Did you wanna try your fish?
Want me to cut the head off for you?

Yeah, it's gross.
Hey, how did that double date go?
- Good.
- [Bran] Yeah?
I mean, then it was terrible.
Put down a whole bunch of fish,
and Adam freaked out.
- But no, it was good. Yeah.
- Okay.
- Uh, so, uh, Brannagan...
- Yeah, Mackenzie.
I kind of told Nick
that we were all gonna go and support him
at this UNICEF thing.
- We?
- Yes, we.
- [Bran] Oh.
- Please. All of us.
I'll pay for Ash and Little.
Mmm. How much is this gonna cost we?
Three hundred.
Three hundred pennies?
It better be fucking pennies.
- It's for children.
- Oh, fuck children.
- Do not fuck children.
- [Mack] Thank you. UNICEF?
Ah, yeah. Tuxedos, free-flowing booze.
- Flowing maybe, not free.
- It's at Custom House.
- So?
- Ghostbusters II was shot there.

- [Adam] Her feature.
- Already?
- Seriously.
- I wanna read it.
- What did you think?
It's really... It's beautiful. It's funny.
I mean, all that family stuff.
And your voice is just... I mean...
The voice is just... It's very you.
Yeah, Kirk's gonna love it.
- Yeah?
- [Kirk] What am I gonna love?
Huh? Untamed, Glennon Doyle.
Meh.
[Kirk] So, Mack,
I heard you'll be at the gala.
Yeah. We're gonna be at the gala.
Are you gonna be at the gala?
Yes. What, is that gonna be
kind of awkward?
- [Mack] No.
- [Bran] Yes, absolutely.
She loves me really.
- What the hell was that?
- What?
Why didn't you tell her about the feature?
I haven't gotten notes from Nick yet.
So?
- So, he's a Pulitzer Prize winner.
- Finalist.
- [Bran giggles, meows]
- I'm gonna wait for his notes, okay?
- Fine.
- [Bran] She wants them notes.
Uh-oh.

- You're welcome. Uh, uh, uh.
Where do you think you're going?
- [chuckles]
- Mmm.
- Figure Rollerblading. You jealous?
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- [Mack laughing]
Then I'm gonna actually hang out
with the crew later if you wanted to come.
I would love to, but I promised my editor
I would get this to them today.
- [Mack] Mmm.
- Yeah.
But good news is,
once this is done, you are up, young lady.
- You'll read my feature?
- I'll read your feature.
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.
Thank you. Mwah. Bye.
Bye.
I'll, uh... I'll leave a key under the mat
again if you wanna stay over.
- Okay.

Mustache with the Natty Light.
We're gonna run Farmers Only

[Mack, Adam, and Little] No.
Wow. Really?
This is how it's gonna be?
You're all matched up.
Brannagan's out in the big bad wilderness
all by himself, huh?
Third person? Really?
Shakespeare used illeism
to indicate heightened emotion.
No, actually, he used it
to indicate egomania.
- Brannagan disagrees.
- [Mack] Yech.
- [Adam] Gross.
- Which one was Farmers?
- The cocktail fork.
- No, that's Little Mermaid.
Goddamn.
How many of these plays do y'all have?
- A lot. Did it for 12 years.
- Huh. I'm sorry, what? 12 years?
- Brannagan had cystic acne in college.
- Don't tell the origin story.
It's long and complicated.
It's not interesting.
- His face was jacked.
- Did, uh, Nick read your article yet?
- He said he'd read it tonight.
- Is he, though?
Dude's been dragging his feet.
What? No.
Mack, it's like two and a half pages
front and back.
When you're on a deadline, you know...
Why am I even saying this to you?
- You know what it is to be on a deadline.
- I can read five pages taking a shit.
I take two shits a day.
That's at least ten pages easy.
Just like... [imitates defecating]
Just shat out ten pages of reading.
How many times do we have to discuss
you not bringing up your bowel movements?
Brannagan's bowel movements are exquisite.
Checkmate. Ooh-whee.
And with that, I'm out.
[Mack] What? Why?
- Ads?
- [Adam] I got some things to do.
- Actually, we have to head out too.
- When did we become a one-round family?
- We're riding the carousel.
- [Mack] Again?
Is that a euphemism?
Ew. No, it's definitely a euphemism.

[calm music continues]
[Mack] Oh, good morning, princess.

come in last night.
Oh, that's because you were, uh, out cold
and even drooling on your chin.
Oh, that sounds like me. [chuckles]

- Shit.
- What?
- I forgot to bring socks.
- Oh, I hate that feeling.
- I know, stinky feet.
- [exhales] So, what is today?
Chess boxing.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it's... it's a real thing.
It's 11 alternating rounds
of chess and boxing, three minutes each,
that ends in either a knockout
or a checkmate.
- Really?
- [Mack] I'm serious.
It's a pro sport. International, actually.
- Wow.
- [Mack] Mm-hmm.
Oh. I, um... [sighs]
I read your piece.
- [Mack] You did?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- [Nick] Yeah.
Oh my God.
That means you finished your manuscript.
- [Nick] It does.
- You finished your manuscript!
- Congratulations, baby.
- Oh, mmm.
- Thank you. I'm so relieved.
- It... it's huge.
Yeah. Yeah.

Sure. Absolutely.

- Don't tempt me. I gotta get to work.
- [Nick chuckles]
Congrats again.
- [Nick] Mmm.
- Enjoy that nap. You deserve it.

Red dress at six o'clock,
green gown at seven-thirty.
Don't look. The whole point
of the clock's you don't look.
- That's right.
- My bad.
[Bran shouts indistinctly]
- Ooh.
- [Little] Hey.
- [Bran] Hey, buddy.
- Looking sharp.
Where's Claire?
- Claire?
- [Bran] Did you ditch her? I hope so.
I need a wingman tonight.
There's a lot of business here.
- She had an emergency.
- Oh no, bleeding gums.
- Family thing.
- Four sets of bleeding gums?
- [snorts]
- It's a little funny.
- Oh, look at that.
- [Bran] Wow. Oh my God.
- [emotional music playing]
- She looks incredible. Wow!
[Little and Ashley] Whoa!
- Damn!
- Whoa!
[Little] Yo.
- [Bran] I'm so proud of her dress choice.
- [Ashley] It's Rent the Runway.
[Bran] Wow.
[sighs] I'm wearing four pairs of Spanx.
If anybody gets cold, jump on in.
It's nice and hot and moist in there.
- Where's Nick?
- Oh, he came early for interviews.
Great. So I'm thinking play
Bait and Switch tonight.
Obviously, he's the bait.
I'm gonna switch him out.
Not happening. Alcohol anyone?
- [Little] Yuppers. [chuckles]
- [Bran] Yes.
- Definitely.
- [Ashley] Loads.
- Shall we?
- Oh, thanks.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.

How are you? Good to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.
This one's for the kids. Ah.
[Mack] Brannagan. Brannagan.
Kirk. Wow, nice to... Weird to see you.
It's always weird to see you.
- Okay.
- Dick Van Dyke's in the hospital.
- You have his tribute ready?
- Yeah. I got a great write-up.
- Best British accent ever, Mary Poppins.
- [Kirk] Stop it. Stop it.
- Paper's light. We need material.
- All right. It's gonna be great.
- Mack has something.
- [Kirk] What? What do you have?
- No.
- Yeah, she... she has something.
- I have nothing.
- She has a feature.
You don't do long-form.
- [Mack] I don't.
- Why didn't you pitch? What is it?
Excuse me. Sorry.
Sweetheart, Lebowitz is by the bar.
Oh, well, you can't hide now,
can you, Fran?
Mack, send me what you have. All right?
- Got it?
- What the hell?
What are you talking about? We're light.
You have something fantastic.
Nick hated it, so no, I don't.
[Adam] Mack.
[in British accent] Uh-oh, Mary Poppins,
trouble's brewing tonight.
- [Adam] Mack.
- [Mack] What, Ads?
[Adam] He said that to you?
No, he... [sighs]
[groans] Here.
[jazz music playing in the background]
- What the hell is this?
- He rewrote it.
- What do you mean, he rewrote it?
- I mean, I asked him for notes, so...
No, these are not notes. This is...
This is a butcher job.
What the hell is this?
This doesn't even sound like you anymore.
What the... No.
Do yours. Turn yours in. Screw that one.
I mean, he's not an amateur, Ads, so...
You're not seriously considering
this version?
Mack, come on.
Are you kidding me right now?
Like, he totally missed the point.
He took out all your family stuff,
all your memories.
Everything that made it you,
he took out. I...
- Screw this dude, man.
- Yo. Okay, calm down.
- That dude is my boyfriend.
- Well, screw your boyfriend.
- Why are you being shitty to me, Ads?
- He rewrote you!
But he doesn't know you. He...
- He doesn't share food, right?
- [Mack groans]
He doesn't eat dairy.
Your fridge is like 90% cheese.
Somebody's not a douchebag
because they take Lactaid.
- He doesn't even like sports.
- We don't have to like the same things.
But he does have to know what you do like.
- I mean, what do you like about him?
- [Mack] What?
What do you like about Nick?
- I'm... [chuckles nervously]
- He wears an eye mask to sleep?
- That is not great. That's not...
- He has matched dinnerware.
That's what you like, right?
It's not the dinnerware. I can buy my own.
Oh, right,
it's 'cause he's an adult, right?
An adult who's been schmoozing for hours
and hasn't checked on you.
- [emotional music playing]
- An adult who took two weeks
to read five fricking pages
and didn't even bother discussing it
with you before he just took over.
An adult who you played games
like a child to win.
You were so preoccupied
with whether you could get him, Mack,
you didn't even stop to think
if you should.
- He's a catch, Ads.
- Right, he's a catch.
[emotional music continues]
Well, I hope you get that drawer.
And I hope you enjoy eating branzino eyes
for the rest of your life.
That's...
You don't eat the eyes!
{\an8}You know, that was actually
so much more fun
than I thought it was gonna be.
Kehinde Wiley is an absolute hoot.
[chuckles]
- Did you get to talk to him?
- [Mack] No.
[Nick] Yeah. God, If he wasn't a painter,
he should be a stand-up comedian.
[Nick chuckles]
Oh, I didn't see much of Adam.
Did he leave early?
- I think so.
- [Nick] Yeah?
A bit flaky, isn't he?
Not at all, actually.
Oh, by the way, nearly forgot.
I, uh... Ta-ta-ta-dah.
I thought you'd like
somewhere to keep your things.
You know, so you'll always have socks.
- [sad piano music playing]
- What?
You rewrote my piece.
[Nick] Yeah.
I mean, you asked me for feedback,
so it was just easier to do it that way.
[chuckles]
Easier?
Oh, wow, that doesn't feel good. Um...
I just wish that you had talked to me
before making edits, you know?
Like had a conversation.
Okay. All right.
Well, don't freak out about it.
W... wow, no,
I am decidedly not freaking out about it.
You know, I... I... I wanna freak out,
and I'd be justified in freaking out,
but that is not the way I'm behaving...
You're not gonna have a job
if you don't up your game.
What?
[sighs] They're doing another round
of layoffs next month,
and local sports is obviously gonna...
Did Kirk tell you that?
- When? When did she tell you?
- Three weeks ago.
[Mack] Three weeks ago?
Why didn't you tell... Oh, that's the reason
why you weren't reading it.
If you hand in something of quality now,
maybe you can move to another beat.
You don't think that's what I'm doing?
[splutters]
You think I didn't know
my job was on the line?
We're dying.
They've been downsizing for years.
I know that my time at the paper
is riding on this.
I mean, I didn't "know" know
the way you "knew" knew, but I knew.
What are you so pissed off about?
You didn't tell me that Kirk told you
that I was getting axed.
I didn't think it was my place to.
It was awkward.
Awkward? We're in a relationship, Nick.
You didn't tell me
you were gonna rewrite me.
Fucking change it back then.
You've got the file.
Just hand in your thing. Good luck.
Look, I don't understand
why you're getting so stressed.
- You took out everything personal to me.
- It was mawkish.
- Mawkish?
- Treacly, saccharine, I dunno, soppy.
No, no, no, I know what the word means.
I just... I don't agree with you.
We could've had that debate,
talked to each other,
if you just told me
the things you don't like.
I didn't like any of it!
I didn't like any of it. Sorry.
[sad piano music playing]
[emotionally] I did do this all wrong.
Oh, I wanted this so bad.
I think we're done.
Done?
[chuckles] Are you serious right now?
What?
Just because I don't like your writing?
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, that's not it.
No, no, no. I am used to people
not liking my writing.
It's actually half the job.
This is just... This, um...
This piece was all of me.
It was everything that I am, Nick.
It was the way I view the world.
I mean, it is...
- I mean, if you don't like that, then...
- Mackenzie...
- I prefer Mack, actually.
- [Nick] What?
It's Mack.
And I hate branzino.

It was bad.

Is she getting fired right now?
There is no way for you to know what else
is in the hopper if you don't talk to me.
There's a reason for you to pitch first.
Not only so I can help hone your angle,
but also because someone else
might be working on a story that overlaps.
Yeah, I...
I'm sorry.
If you wanna change lanes in this company,
Mack, you need to signal first.

No shenanigans, just be direct, right?

No.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, I realized...
Was it sophomore year? My sophomore year?
The end of my seventh grade.
You made me pinky promise
to never tell Mack.
- [Bran] Freshman year.
- No.
- [Bran] Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.
Adam and I tried. No, we tried.
We tried under the shirt,
over the bra, sophomore year.
- And he wasn't into it.
- He thought you weren't into it.
I was into it.
Yeah, Mack, that was the year
that you lost your mom, though.
You were really sad. He kind of was like...
[Bran] He kind of thought
that he... [clears throat]
...had taken advantage of you.
- [Little] Yeah. He beat himself up.
- [Bran] He was really... He kicked himself...
- Two years.
- I was in high school. Had to be three.
Right. No, yeah, three years.
Wait, you guys have known about this
for over a decade?
- That long?
- And you knew?

I knew three days on the job.
You came in and stole

Wow. You need therapy.

[Adam and Bran] What?
- I sold my spleen. I didn't need it.
- [giggles] Oh, for tonight?

- Damn.
You think he'll like it?
Oh, I think he'll jizz, like...

[laughs] Yes, that's great.
I mean, not really great.
I think that's pretty good because
he'll just jizz from pure excitement.

- Nope. No, you don't.
- Why aren't we going this way?
- Shortcut this way.
A little further.
[music stops]
- How is this a shortcut, dude?
- [Bran] Trust me.
Look, you're gonna see in a second.
It's so much shorter this way.
[indistinct shouting in the distance]
[PA announcer] Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Yankees Stadium.
- I think I might take up acting.
- [Ashley and Bran] It was her idea.
- [calm music playing]
- [PA announcer continues indistinctly]
[Mack] Hey.
Shouldn't you be in the press box?
Like, what part of the... What play is this?
We did run Bag the Wrong Man,
obviously, just to get you here,
but this isn't...
This is the "no play" play.
- The "no play" play? Hmm.
- [Mack] Yeah.
This is the "no play" play.
It was a dicey move. The diciest.
[both chuckle]
[Mack] I'm in the danger zone, but,
um, I'm laying it on the line here, so...
- Aren't you gonna be late for the game?
- I have two minutes and 32 seconds.
So that means I have two minutes
to stand here with you
in my favorite place.
You know, where, um, Babe Ruth played,
and DiMaggio played, and Yogi Berra,
and where Lou Gehrig
made his farewell speech,
and Nelson Mandela spoke,
and three popes held mass,
and 15,000 people gathered
to pray for 9/11.
For the past few months,
I've been gathering
all these memories from fans.
None of them said any of that.
It was all about Cracker Jack toys
and getting a beer with Dad and...
And being there for the Giants
to win their coin toss
right after coming back from Iraq,
but it was never about the plays.
And for my parents?
[emotionally] It was sitting right here,
meeting for the first time
and falling in love over Reggie! bars.
And so that's why
I wanted you to come here.
So that I can tell you... [chuckles]
...you're kind and thoughtful and funny.
I love that you save half
of everything you're eating for me,
you walk me to the train,
that you know when I need a falafel
'cause I'm down,
and you don't make fun of me
because I smell like 'em.
Because you tell me when I'm being
an idiot, not to hurt me but to help.
And because with you, I feel safe
to be fully and truly myself.
[calm music continues]
Because you know that...
that there's magic in the small things.
That the park next to the stadium
could be magic,
and that the most important things
aren't the most obvious.
I'm about to cover Sox-Yankees
for the first time in my career,
and I already know that my favorite moment
of today is standing here telling you...
I love you, Adam.
Mack...
if you ever talk to me that much again...
- Oh, I have a little bit left...
- [Adam] No more.
So much talking.
- [Mack] So much?
- Yeah. Too much.
[Mack] I worked on it.
I had a really nice...
No. I'm gonna kiss you now.
[happy, soulful music playing]
- [squeals] Oh, wow. Oh, wow.
- Wow, they're going for it.
This is totally gonna fuck the dynamic.
- [alarm ringing]
- Oh no. No. Oh no.
- Oh, I gotta go. [chuckling] I gotta go.
- [Bran] Don't get fired.
- Go.
- [Little and Ashley] Go!
- [Bran] You'll get fired.
- [Mack] Will you take him to the seats?
- [Bran and Ashley] Yes!
- [Mack] First-base line, baby.
- Oh, first base. You're spoiling me.
- [Bran] Go! Go!
- [Mack] Okay, bye! I love you!
- [Little, Ashley, Bran cheering]
- I love you.
- [happy, soulful music intensifying]
[Bran] Yeah! You better not have kids
or something crazy!
- [Ashley] Gross. Come on.
- [Adam] No one said anything about kids.
[Bran] Look at Little.
Don't need any more of them.
- [Little] I'm not a kid.
- [Ashley] He's not.
- [Bran] You're a grown baby.
- [Little] You're a baby with a busted eye.
- [Ashley] No, you kind of are a baby.
- [Adam] Shut the fuck up.
- [bat cracks]
- [fans cheering]
