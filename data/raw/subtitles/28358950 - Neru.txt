<b>Thumba Police Station.</b>
<b>Yes, Circle Inspector speaking.</b>
<b>Where?</b>
<b>Sir, I made the call to the station.</b>
<b>Sir, this is the girl's father.</b>
<b>- Please wait outside.
- Okay, sir.</b>
<b>Where is the girl?</b>
<b>- Record her statement.
- Okay, sir.</b>
<b>- Are you Seema?
- Yes.</b>
<b>You were not here?</b>
<b>After Sir and his wife
left for the wedding,</b>
<b>I had gone to the bank.</b>
<b>What do you do?</b>
<b>I have a business, sir.</b>
<b>I run a Curio shop at Kovalam.</b>
<b>Shanthi, what did the police say?
Have they found out who it is?</b>
<b>How can a blind girl
identify the person?</b>
<b>There has been contact.</b>
<b>Vaginal wall contusion is there.</b>
<b>We've collected the swab.</b>
<b>Report?</b>
<b>It will be ready by tomorrow.
I'll give it tomorrow.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>The mother and daughter can sit here.</b>
<b>You please wait outside.</b>
<b>After Dad and Mom went out,</b>
<b>Seema Chechi went to the bank.</b>
<b>I went to take a bath then.</b>
<b>When I got out after the bath,</b>
<b>I felt the presence
of someone else in the room.</b>
<b>No, Mom!</b>
<b>I'll sleep alone.</b>
<b>- But, dear...
- Mom, please.</b>
<b>I want to be alone.</b>
<b>Don't force her.</b>
<b>Don't lock the door, dear.</b>
<b>What did the police say?</b>
<b>They need to find who it is.</b>
<b>That's the first major obstacle.</b>
<b>It's not like other
ordinary cases, right?</b>
<b>Since she is blind....</b>
<b>This is it, sir.</b>
<b>Did your daughter make this?</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>She does sculptures.</b>
<b>She had learned it
before she lost her eye-sight.</b>
<b>But how can she do this
without seeing the person?</b>
<b>While he was assaulting me,</b>
<b>I discerned his face
through my fingers.</b>
<b>We suspect someone, sir.</b>
<b>The day before the incident,</b>
<b>a boy who resembles this sculpture
had come here asking for directions.</b>
<b>He had come to our neighbour
Vinod's house.</b>
<b>What's the name of your friend?</b>
<b>His name is Michael, sir.</b>
<b>He is my class-mate.</b>
<b>Why did he come here?</b>
<b>To invite me for his wedding.</b>
<b>Do you know where he would be,
at present?</b>
<b>Hello!
Michael, right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>- Come.
- What is it, sir?</b>
<b>- Come.
- Come on.</b>
<b>- Come, we'll tell you.
- What's the matter?</b>
<b>Dear!</b>
<b>- Take her away!
- Dear!</b>
<b>At today's identification parade
in Thumba, Thiruvananthapuram,</b>
<b>for the assault case of the blind girl,</b>
<b>she successfully identified the culprit.</b>
<b>The girl, who's the
victim in the rape case,</b>
<b>identified the culprit
through sound and touch.</b>
<b>The accused Michael Joseph,
who has been arrested,</b>
<b>is the son of Mumbai based Malayali
businessman Christopher Joseph.</b>
<b>He's engaged
to the Central Minister's daughter...</b>
<b>This is the punishment that the Lord
has given him, for deserting us.</b>
<b>First, the girl lost her eye-sight.</b>
<b>And now, this.</b>
<b>This won't be the end of it.</b>
<b>He will continue to suffer!</b>
<b>In the name of settlements
and compensations,</b>
<b>I have invested a lot on you.</b>
<b>And I am still investing!</b>
<b>Why are you humiliating us like this?</b>
<b>Your wedding has been fixed, right?</b>
<b>What do we tell them now?</b>
<b>Christy, what will we do now?</b>
<b>Let him stay behind
bars for some time.</b>
<b>Let's see whether he mends his ways
at least then.</b>
<b>What's the point in crying?</b>
<b>Didn't you see how
he's behaving?</b>
<b>You must save him somehow.</b>
<b>Shall we try talking to that girl's family?</b>
<b>- Or, shall we go to their place?
- Ancy, this is not Mumbai.</b>
<b>This is Kerala!</b>
<b>I don't want to know all that, Christy.</b>
<b>You must save him,
come what may!</b>
<b>I need Advocate Rajashekhar!</b>
<b>He's mostly in Delhi now, sir.</b>
<b>- I don't care! I want him here!
- Sir!</b>
<b>- Hi, CJ!
- It's been a long time!</b>
<b>Yeah!</b>
<b>Meet my daughter, Poornima.</b>
<b>- Hello! Lovely meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.</b>
<b>- Is she a lawyer?
- Yeah.</b>
<b>She's an independent lawyer....
at the Supreme Court.</b>
<b>Wow! That's nice!</b>
<b>There's a matter
at the High Court tomorrow.</b>
<b>- So, we came here together.
- Okay.</b>
<b>How will we handle this case?</b>
<b>His marriage has been fixed.</b>
<b>If he doesn't get bail...</b>
<b>Usually, bail won't be granted.</b>
<b>But when it comes to clients like you,</b>
<b>I have my own ways, CJ.</b>
<b>First, let's try for a settlement.</b>
<b>This girl's father has two sons
from his first marriage.</b>
<b>Let's make an attempt through them.</b>
<b>But you just landed!</b>
<b>How could you...?</b>
<b>That's how I function!</b>
<b>Once I accept a case,</b>
<b>I'll do a background study first.</b>
<b>Then, I'll try for a settlement.</b>
<b>But that would be more profitable
for both of us.</b>
<b>Okay, okay.</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>I called you guys
to talk about the settlement.</b>
<b>We can pay a fair amount
to that girl as compensation.</b>
<b>You must talk to her father.</b>
<b>We will talk to him, sir.</b>
<b>What would be the amount, sir?</b>
<b>- Come.
- Okay, sir.</b>
<b>There's no point
in fighting the case, Dad.</b>
<b>You'll only be humiliated further.</b>
<b>He will be acquitted easily.</b>
<b>His dad is loaded with money.</b>
<b>Nothing will work against them.</b>
<b>We can demand this
only as long as he is in jail.</b>
<b>If you settle this, accepting
the amount they're offering,</b>
<b>you can live comfortably hereafter.</b>
<b>I'm happy that you guys took the effort
to come here, my dear sons.</b>
<b>Dad, though we're not related by blood,</b>
<b>Sara is our sister, after all.</b>
<b>If she has a problem,
shouldn't we intervene?</b>
<b>If you are saying this honestly,</b>
<b>you should be helping us
in fighting against them legally.</b>
<b>We won't be able to fight
them legally, Dad.</b>
<b>They will purchase everything they want.</b>
<b>If there's such a possibility
before them,</b>
<b>will they be ready for
a settlement with us?</b>
<b>They're not interested
in pursuing the case.</b>
<b>We just have tell them
the amount that we need.</b>
<b>I spoke for so long just to get
this out of your mouths.</b>
<b>Don't I know how
the two of you are?</b>
<b>Am I not your father?</b>
<b>Get out of here!</b>
<b>Shameless fellows!</b>
<b>Trying to make a settlement?</b>
<b>- Sara, we were..
- I have nothing more to say.</b>
<b>Even if we lose the case,</b>
<b>we're not so desperate
as to live off their money.</b>
<b>No one has to come here
to talk about that!</b>
<b>- No wonder this happened to you!
- Get out of here!</b>
<b>You will suffer for what you did
to my mother!</b>
<b>You will suffer doing endless
rounds of the court, with this blind girl.</b>
<b>I don't care!
Get out of here!</b>
<b>Get out, both of you!</b>
<b>What did the Minister say?</b>
<b>He is upset.</b>
<b>His daughter hasn't been able to digest
the fact that Michael is innocent.</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>I don't think the settlement
would be possible, sir.</b>
<b>- Are they on the line?
- Yes, sir.</b>
<b>What's the problem?</b>
<b>Sir, Dad is not agreeing
to the settlement.</b>
<b>Are there any media-persons
over there?</b>
<b>No, sir.</b>
<b>You must call some people
from the media.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Okay, sir.</b>
<b>What is it?</b>
<b>We have a small task.</b>
<b>Do you know who we are?</b>
<b>We are the victim's brothers.</b>
<b>We know why you've gathered here.</b>
<b>- Didn't you call us here?
- Who called you?</b>
<b>Didn't you call us here?</b>
<b>- Who the hell called you here?
- Mind your language!</b>
<b>- Hello, sir!</b>
<b>- Mohammed, what have you done?
- Sir, I...</b>
<b>Didn't I tell you that
we should be really careful</b>
<b>until the bail application
is considered?</b>
<b>- Let me tell you, sir.
- Annoying the media will act against you.</b>
<b>Sir, I'm not aware of all this.</b>
<b>You know who's representing
the culprit, right?</b>
<b>India's leading Defence Lawyer.</b>
<b>Advocate Rajashekhar.</b>
<b>Where are you all running off to?</b>
<b>- Is it a roll call?
- Rajashekharan sir has a trial today.</b>
<b>- Which Rajashekharan?
- Rajashekharan sir, from Supreme Court.</b>
<b>- The Thumba case.
- Oh! It's today?</b>
<b>Crime No. 2752/2022.</b>
<b>Thumba Police Station.</b>
<b>Accused, Michael.</b>
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar!</b>
<b>Welcome back to Trivandrum District Court.</b>
<b>Thank you.
Thank you, Your Honour.</b>
<b>It must be a sensational case.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>It's an ordinary case.</b>
<b>Then you will make it sensational
with your presence.</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>this is a case of house-trespass
and rape...</b>
<b>in the broad daylight,</b>
<b>on a blind girl.</b>
<b>An unknown young man
appears out of thin air,</b>
<b>rapes a blind girl
in the middle of the day,</b>
<b>leaves no trace behind,
and vanishes.</b>
<b>That girl, who has never seen
anything with her eyes in her life,</b>
<b>makes a sculpture of that person
using her own hands.</b>
<b>The police, upon seeing the face
of the sculpture, charge the accused.</b>
<b>- She could see until she was 12..
- What 12? That's not relevant!</b>
<b>Your Honour, the crimes
of rape and assault,</b>
<b>outlined in the IPC written in 1860,</b>
<b>aren't exclusive to Uttar Pradesh.</b>
<b>There's no shortage of such stories
in our Kerala Police case diaries either.</b>
<b>Yes, yes.</b>
<b>I've seen the files.</b>
<b>I was also curious.</b>
<b>How did she identify him?</b>
<b>The girl knows how to make sculptures.</b>
<b>Using that skill,
she made a statue of the accused.</b>
<b>That's how he was arrested.</b>
<b>We're lucky that the statue
didn't resemble any of us.</b>
<b>What do you say, PP?</b>
<b>Err... Err...</b>
<b>Evidence....</b>
<b>Evidence is still being collected.</b>
<b>But... effective investigation
is going on, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Wound certificate?</b>
<b>Err...</b>
<b>What are you searching for?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>There is a contusion!</b>
<b>She's in her teens, right?</b>
<b>She's likely to have contusions
in many places.</b>
<b>So, the State has no objection
to granting bail?</b>
<b>No, no, no!</b>
<b>It's not like that.
Offence is committed, Your Honour...</b>
<b>By the... On the victim.</b>
<b>Effective investigation is also going on.</b>
<b>But the evidence...</b>
<b>- What about the test identification?
- In the test identification,</b>
<b>the girl has identified him
by touch and sound.</b>
<b>Yeah, right!</b>
<b>How can a girl who doesn't know
how her own face looks like,</b>
<b>identify another person's face?</b>
<b>This is just a farce being played
out in front of the Magistrate.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>there is no trace of semen,</b>
<b>no injuries found in the wound certificate,</b>
<b>fingerprints are also absent.</b>
<b>The Prosecutor is
struggling to oppose,</b>
<b>as there is no material evidence to connect
the accused with this alleged crime.</b>
<b>Bail application may kindly
be allowed, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Bail granted.</b>
<b>Huh?</b>
<b>Next!</b>
<b>Sir! Sir! Did you expect
that bail would be granted?</b>
<b>Well, 100%.</b>
<b>Because this is a fake case.</b>
<b>My client has been framed.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Sir, I didn't expect that bail
will be granted so quickly.</b>
<b>What can I do if the court
does not believe this story of yours?</b>
<b>Story?</b>
<b>Convincing you about all this
is not my job!</b>
<b>If you have any doubts,
talk to the investigating officer.</b>
<b>He got bail?</b>
<b>But everyone told me that bail
won't be granted in such cases usually.</b>
<b>According to them,
the evidence isn't sufficient.</b>
<b>Didn't our daughter identify him?</b>
<b>She sculpted his face, right?</b>
<b>That's not credible enough, apparently.</b>
<b>Don't worry, dear.</b>
<b>The case is not over, right?</b>
<b>We will continue to fight!</b>
<b>Michael,</b>
<b>tell me whatever happened,
as they happened.</b>
<b>I don't want you to miss anything.</b>
<b>My God!</b>
<b>He's a born criminal!</b>
<b>He has created enough loopholes
to evade punishment himself.</b>
<b>To be honest, such guys
should be killed on the spot.</b>
<b>Dear...</b>
<b>We are lawyers!
Don't forget that.</b>
<b>We are human beings too, Dad!</b>
<b>If we don't accept this case,
someone else will.</b>
<b>Or the Government will hire
a lawyer for him, funded by them.</b>
<b>How does it matter then?</b>
<b>By the way, what's
happening with your case?</b>
<b>I've got the order.</b>
<b>- I will leave tomorrow.
- Oh!</b>
<b>When are you coming?</b>
<b>I have two more important meetings.</b>
<b>Sometimes, tomorrow evening.
Otherwise, day after.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Why did you want to
meet me urgently, sir?</b>
<b>Most likely, I'll be transferred from here.</b>
<b>There was immense pressure upon me
to make some adjustments.</b>
<b>But I didn't give in.</b>
<b>The Public Prosecutor
is not dependable.</b>
<b>So, you must give an application
requesting for a Special Public Prosecutor.</b>
<b>I have some connections
in the Home Ministry.</b>
<b>Moreover, the Government
usually considers the name</b>
<b>that the investigating officer suggests.</b>
<b>I will do as you say, sir.</b>
<b>And one more thing.</b>
<b>Many will approach you,
to take up your case.</b>
<b>They will say that they can assist
the current Prosecutor and all that.</b>
<b>But do not take any decision,
without consulting me.</b>
<b>Okay, sir.</b>
<b>- Print this.
- Okay, sir.</b>
<b>Mr. Mohammed...</b>
<b>I am a Defence Lawyer.</b>
<b>It's not because I have a problem
in appearing for the victim.</b>
<b>I'm really busy.</b>
<b>The trial of a murder
case is going on now.</b>
<b>However much your fee is,
I can pay it together as a lump-sum.</b>
<b>It's not about the fee, Mr. Mohammed.</b>
<b>I told you, right?</b>
<b>I am really busy.</b>
<b>It would be better if you
approach someone else.</b>
<b>Okay then.</b>
<b>- Give these at the court tomorrow.
- Okay, sir.</b>
<b>Brother!</b>
<b>There's no point in meeting
any of the senior advocates here.</b>
<b>This is entirely
Advocate Rajashekharan's game.</b>
<b>Advocate Rajashekharan was
at the Tennis Club yesterday.</b>
<b>He must have influenced
all the senior advocates.</b>
<b>They are rich people.</b>
<b>They can do anything they want!</b>
<b>We haven't hurt anyone till date.</b>
<b>Yet...</b>
<b>why do we have to suffer...</b>
<b>I am Advocate Sudheer Kottayil.</b>
<b>She just has to sign
this document.</b>
<b>I will take care of everything else.</b>
<b>Even if Sir says that
he has accepted this case,</b>
<b>consider that you've
won half the battle.</b>
<b>Didn't I tell you, sir?</b>
<b>Give me a day's time.</b>
<b>I will come to your office.</b>
<b>Mr. Mohammed,</b>
<b>you know who
the defence lawyer is, right?</b>
<b>Major games are at play now.</b>
<b>With every moment
that you're wasting now,</b>
<b>your case is becoming weaker.</b>
<b>If the fee is the problem,
we can give you a discount.</b>
<b>Sudheer sir considers this case
as a prestige issue.</b>
<b>- Yes.
- Didn't I tell you, sir?</b>
<b>I will come to your office.</b>
<b>I wonder why he was so late
in approaching you.</b>
<b>Many more such frauds
will approach you.</b>
<b>None of them are trustworthy.</b>
<b>Don't worry, Mohammed.</b>
<b>We'll find someone else.</b>
<b>I'm not asking you to refrain from
testifying or to change sides, Chechi.</b>
<b>In your testimony,</b>
<b>just add certain words
that we're suggesting.</b>
<b>No one will understand anything.</b>
<b>And you will get some money too.</b>
<b>How much will I get?</b>
<b>Advocate!</b>
<b>It's a success!</b>
<b>You know my account number, right?</b>
<b>The money should be credited
in my account tomorrow morning.</b>
<b>What? What?</b>
<b>Easy?</b>
<b>Then why didn't you do it yourself?</b>
<b>I had to brainwash her
for five to six hours.</b>
<b>If the money is not credited in
my account by tomorrow morning,</b>
<b>the testimony will change.</b>
<b>Okay.
Okay then.</b>
<b>Stop, stop!</b>
<b>Hey!</b>
<b>Long time, sir!</b>
<b>- What are you doing here?
- I came to meet someone.</b>
<b>There's a friend of yours, right?</b>
<b>- Advocate Vijayamohan?
- Yes.</b>
<b>Where is he now?</b>
<b>What's the matter?</b>
<b>I need to talk to him
about a case.</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>- Please wait here, sir.
- Okay.</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>Huh?</b>
<b>Ahaana!</b>
<b>Who?</b>
<b>It's Ahaana, sir.</b>
<b>Ah!</b>
<b>- What is it?
- Someone is here to meet you.</b>
<b>Huh?</b>
<b>This...</b>
<b>Sir, that witness has escaped.</b>
<b>He can't say that, it seems.</b>
<b>- Rather than catching him...
- Hey!</b>
<b>Just a minute.</b>
<b>- Namaste.
- Sir, this is CI Paul Varghese.</b>
<b>- Hello.
- I'll call you back.</b>
<b>Hang up.</b>
<b>Sir, did you notice...</b>
<b>a new case on the media recently?</b>
<b>The case of a blind girl who was raped?</b>
<b>That famous group from Bombay?</b>
<b>Yes, CJ Group.</b>
<b>It's his son.</b>
<b>The Public Prosecutor
messed up in the case.</b>
<b>The accused got bail.</b>
<b>In this case,</b>
<b>as the Special Public Prosecutor...</b>
<b>We're planning to suggest your name, sir.</b>
<b>Me?</b>
<b>What are you saying?</b>
<b>Sir, it's been many years
since I stepped into the court.</b>
<b>You still have that fire!</b>
<b>We have confidence in you, sir.</b>
<b>There are so many
experienced advocates out there.</b>
<b>Give this case to them.</b>
<b>Sir, since Rajashekhar
is the defence lawyer,</b>
<b>most of the advocates are
not ready to accept this case.</b>
<b>Even if such a
person comes forward,</b>
<b>they won't be sincere about it.</b>
<b>To handle a trial...</b>
<b>Sir, I am not fit for this case.</b>
<b>Sir, long back...</b>
<b>Rajashekhar had us in deep water, right?</b>
<b>Don't you want to get
back at him somehow?</b>
<b>There's no revenge
in my heart towards anyone.</b>
<b>I had forgotten it long back.</b>
<b>Sir, it's not about revenge
for me either.</b>
<b>I clearly know
what your passion is, sir.</b>
<b>It's out of my desire to see you
practising as a good lawyer, like earlier.</b>
<b>That won't be possible now.</b>
<b>Sir, can you come to a place with me?</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>Dear, it's us!</b>
<b>Dear, someone is here to meet you.</b>
<b>He's the Advocate who's going
to fight the case for us.</b>
<b>- Hey, I--
- Please don't say anything now, sir.</b>
<b>Please come, sir.</b>
<b>Come.
Please!</b>
<b>Go inside, sir.</b>
<b>Dear, this is Advocate Vijayamohan sir.</b>
<b>Namaste, sir.</b>
<b>Namaste.</b>
<b>Sir, these are all sculptures
made by my daughter.</b>
<b>She lost her eye-sight
when she was 12 years old.</b>
<b>She had learned all this from me,
before that.</b>
<b>If you want to know something,</b>
<b>you can talk to her.</b>
<b>- But, I...
- Sir, please talk to her now.</b>
<b>We'll decide everything else later.</b>
<b>Come, let's wait outside.</b>
<b>Carry on, sir.</b>
<b>Come.</b>
<b>Sir?</b>
<b>Huh?</b>
<b>Thank you, sir.</b>
<b>Dad had told me that no one
was willing to take on this case.</b>
<b>At least you felt the
need to take it up, right?</b>
<b>What do you want to know?</b>
<b>Please ask me.</b>
<b>- Hey, I...
- My name is Sara.</b>
<b>Sara...</b>
<b>Sara, I'm not a practising
Advocate at the moment.</b>
<b>I know.</b>
<b>I had heard CI Sir talking to Dad.</b>
<b>Dad says that I can hear everything
even louder, since I am blind.</b>
<b>I know, sir.</b>
<b>We will win this case.</b>
<b>I can sense it.</b>
<b>Things are different from how
you're imagining them, Sara.</b>
<b>So...</b>
<b>You haven't come
to take up this case?</b>
<b>I don't know whether you would
understand what I'm saying.</b>
<b>It's been many years
since I attended a trial.</b>
<b>I lost that touch.</b>
<b>I am not...</b>
<b>confident any more.</b>
<b>I can understand that...</b>
<b>more than anyone else, sir.</b>
<b>But think about my situation, sir.</b>
<b>My father died
when I was really young.</b>
<b>After that,</b>
<b>I lost my eye-sight.</b>
<b>Even in that darkness,</b>
<b>through a God-given skill,</b>
<b>I found a path to light.</b>
<b>And now, this.</b>
<b>All the sounds around me...</b>
<b>are really scaring me.</b>
<b>But...</b>
<b>I will break free from all this.</b>
<b>My blindness is just physical,</b>
<b>not mental.</b>
<b>I refuse to live in fear
of the man who assaulted me.</b>
<b>Shall I tell you what
your situation is right now, sir?</b>
<b>You're unable to take up this case,</b>
<b>and you don't want to hurt me either.</b>
<b>You are an honest man.</b>
<b>Otherwise,</b>
<b>you'd have cooked up a lie
and escaped from here.</b>
<b>Don't be sad about that, sir.</b>
<b>I'm sure someone will come to help me.</b>
<b>That belief keeps me going.</b>
<b>Will there be a delay in getting
the Government order, sir?</b>
<b>We can speed that up.</b>
<b>Shall we leave?</b>
<b>- Let's leave.
- Sir...</b>
<b>- The case...
- Let me study the case.</b>
<b>- He didn't say anything.
- He will. We'll sort it out.</b>
<b>Sir, shall I ask you something openly?</b>
<b>What's the actual reason why
you're trying to avoid this case?</b>
<b>Are you afraid of failure?</b>
<b>My own failure doesn't concern me;</b>
<b>but it's crucial that
the girl doesn't fail.</b>
<b>You said it, sir.</b>
<b>This is exactly why
we came to you, sir.</b>
<b>Which other lawyer
would think in this way?</b>
<b>Think about it and let us know
about your decision, sir.</b>
<b>We are all counting on you.</b>
<b>It's not because I don't trust you, sir.</b>
<b>Just consider that I am
sharing my concerns openly.</b>
<b>Will this lawyer be right for us, sir?</b>
<b>He is highly knowledgeable
in the field of law.</b>
<b>He's well updated too.</b>
<b>In several important criminal cases,</b>
<b>he's the one who writes
argument notes for lawyers.</b>
<b>Similarly, in many complicated cases,</b>
<b>even senior lawyers call him
to seek advice.</b>
<b>That's his source of income, as well.</b>
<b>Forgive me, sir.</b>
<b>I don't really know
much about this.</b>
<b>Yet, I am asking this.</b>
<b>Giving legal opinions
and handling a trial...</b>
<b>are two entirely
different things, right?</b>
<b>He's a lawyer who used
to handle trials very well.</b>
<b>Why did he stop it then?</b>
<b>It's an incident that
happened many years ago.</b>
<b>Rajashekhar was a senior lawyer</b>
<b>who had an extensive career
specializing in criminal cases.</b>
<b>Vijayamohan, who started
as a junior in his office,</b>
<b>swiftly became established
in the field of trials.</b>
<b>Around that time,
Rajashekhar's daughter, Poornima...</b>
<b>joined the office as a junior lawyer.</b>
<b>As time went by, they grew
quite close to each other.</b>
<b>That could explain why Vijayamohan...</b>
<b>chose to stay there
instead of setting up his own office.</b>
<b>Every phase of Vijayamohan's growth,</b>
<b>happened right in front
of Rajashekharan's eyes.</b>
<b>And... the closeness between Vijayamohan
and his daughter didn't please him.</b>
<b>That's when I was appointed as
the Sessions Clerk in the court,</b>
<b>having passed the Government test.</b>
<b>Vijayamohan borrowed certain
court documents from me,</b>
<b>explaining that they
were needed for a case,</b>
<b>promising to return
them on the next day.</b>
<b>As per the rules, we're not
supposed to give it to anyone.</b>
<b>But we do help certain lawyers
whom we trust,</b>
<b>when it comes to emergency situations.</b>
<b>Anyway,</b>
<b>those documents went
missing from Vijayamohan.</b>
<b>It became a huge issue.</b>
<b>The court intervened...</b>
<b>and suspended Vijayamohan
from the bar council for five years.</b>
<b>Along with that, I lost my job too.</b>
<b>But we realized after a while...</b>
<b>that it was Rajashekhar,
who was behind all this.</b>
<b>Soon after, Rajashekhar got his daughter
married to a Supreme Court lawyer.</b>
<b>And she shifted base to Delhi.</b>
<b>So, after his suspension period,</b>
<b>he never got back to practising?</b>
<b>He did start practising,</b>
<b>but he wasn't getting
any good cases.</b>
<b>Knowing that he could become
a threat if he advanced further,</b>
<b>everyone joined forces
to suppress him.</b>
<b>When Section 114's presumption....</b>
<b>is limited to the recovery
of stolen properties,</b>
<b>it can be presumed that he stole it,</b>
<b>or received the stolen properties.</b>
<b>But it cannot be presumed
that he committed the murder,</b>
<b>unless there are foundational facts.</b>
<b>Double presumption is not possible.</b>
<b>Sir, anything about the case?</b>
<b>I have many cases.
Which case are you talking about?</b>
<b>Refer Justin v/s State of Kerala.</b>
<b>- The rape of the blind girl.
- Oh! That one?</b>
<b>Haven't you heard of "easy money"?</b>
<b>Money that's made easily,
without putting in any effort?</b>
<b>This case is an attempt
to make money like that.</b>
<b>Who is behind this, sir?</b>
<b>It will be revealed gradually.</b>
<b>Anyway, we have strong evidence
to prove that my client is innocent.</b>
<b>- Sir, the Central Minister's daughter--
- Sorry!</b>
<b>No more comments, please.</b>
<b>Talking about direct evidence...</b>
<b>The content of the chemical substance
found from the vaginal wall,</b>
<b>and the chemical substance of the condom
found from the accused's wallet,</b>
<b>are one and the same.</b>
<b>There are no fingerprints.</b>
<b>And... the day before the incident,</b>
<b>the accused stayed in
the neighbouring house,</b>
<b>and we have
witnesses to testify that.</b>
<b>Proving the identification in court...</b>
<b>is the challenge in this case.</b>
<b>The Government has given
this car for you, sir.</b>
<b>To take it back
after the case, right?</b>
<b>I don't want any new habits.</b>
<b>I'll take an Uber.</b>
<b>- Paul!
- Sir!</b>
<b>The photos of the sculpture
and the memory card...</b>
<b>are not present in the CD.</b>
<b>It's present, sir.
It's present in the Mahazar report.</b>
<b>It's present only in the Mahazar.</b>
<b>It's missing in the CD.</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>So, he must have shifted it.</b>
<b>The new investigating officer.</b>
<b>Come, come!</b>
<b>Sir, this is Ashwathy.</b>
<b>She is my friend's sister.</b>
<b>Can she be your junior?</b>
<b>Please don't say no, sir.</b>
<b>What are you thinking?</b>
<b>I'm not sure whether
I'll complete this case itself.</b>
<b>Sir, I just wanted her to assist
someone who knows the law.</b>
<b>- You don't have to pay her any money.
- Do you think I have any money?</b>
<b>- Sir, please.
- Do whatever you want.</b>
<b>Come, come.</b>
<b>Poornima!</b>
<b>This is the place where
you began practising.</b>
<b>Do you want to pay a visit?</b>
<b>- No, Dad. I need to go.
- Okay.</b>
<b>All the best!</b>
<b>What's the name of the Special PP?</b>
<b>Sir, I heard that it's some guy
named Vijayamohan.</b>
<b>He was reportedly
on suspension for a while.</b>
<b>SC number 99/2022.</b>
<b>Accused, Michael.</b>
<b>CW 1, 2 and 3 present.</b>
<b>CW 1, Seema.</b>
<b>I swear in the name of God...</b>
<b>I shall state only
the truth in the court.</b>
<b>I shall state the entire truth,</b>
<b>and nothing but the truth.</b>
<b>Chief!</b>
<b>Where do you work?</b>
<b>At Mohammed...</b>
<b>I work at Mohammed sir's house.</b>
<b>What are you work hours like?</b>
<b>From 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.</b>
<b>How long have you known
this family for?</b>
<b>For five years...</b>
<b>I've been working
there for five years.</b>
<b>Who all are there in that house?</b>
<b>Sir, his wife and his daughter.</b>
<b>Their daughter is blind,</b>
<b>so she always needs
someone to be with her.</b>
<b>- Do you know what happened in this case?
- Yes, I do.</b>
<b>Sir and his wife went to attend
a wedding on that day.</b>
<b>I had gone to the bank.</b>
<b>Since their daughter was alone, I locked
the door and informed her before leaving.</b>
<b>When I came back from the bank,</b>
<b>I saw that she was absolutely terrified.</b>
<b>I knew it when I saw her,
that someone had heinously assaulted her.</b>
<b>I got really scared.</b>
<b>I called Sir immediately.</b>
<b>I couldn't reach him.</b>
<b>Then I called his wife.</b>
<b>I couldn't reach her too.</b>
<b>When I was clueless
about what to do,</b>
<b>I saw the lady from
the neighbouring house.</b>
<b>I went to her and told her
what happened.</b>
<b>She and her husband
called Mohammed sir,</b>
<b>but they couldn't reach him.</b>
<b>After that, they called the police.</b>
<b>Mohammed sir and his wife
got back by then.</b>
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Yes.
Cross!</b>
<b>Sure!</b>
<b>- Seema?
- Yes.</b>
<b>It's me.</b>
<b>How many keys
does this house have?</b>
<b>Two keys.</b>
<b>So, you cannot say now</b>
<b>whether someone unlocked the house in
the interim using a duplicate key, or not.</b>
<b>- It cannot be--
- Look there and say it.</b>
<b>It cannot be
unlocked like that, sir.</b>
<b>One key is with me.</b>
<b>- The other one is with Sir.
- Okay.</b>
<b>If someone duplicates the key that's
with you without your knowledge--</b>
<b>- Who will duplicate it?
- Pay attention to what I'm saying.</b>
<b>Imagine that someone else made a duplicate
key for the key that's with you.</b>
<b>If someone else unlocks this house
using that key,</b>
<b>will you be able to know that?</b>
<b>Err.. No!</b>
<b>No! So, how can you say that
no one else has unlocked the house?</b>
<b>But nobody else--</b>
<b>Hey! Just respond with 'yes'
or 'no' to my questions.</b>
<b>Don't try to act smart.</b>
<b>Your Honour, he's scaring
the witness unnecessarily.</b>
<b>She's coming to the court
for the first time.</b>
<b>So?
Shouldn't I ask my questions?</b>
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan, what is this?</b>
<b>No, Your Honour.
He cannot intimidate the witness.</b>
<b>I am not intimidating!</b>
<b>I will decide how to frame
my questions for the witness.</b>
<b>You keep quiet and sit!</b>
<b>Well, no wonder!</b>
<b>People who haven't seen even
the court's verandah in years...</b>
<b>are Special Public Prosecutors now.</b>
<b>May I continue?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Let me finish this!</b>
<b>Seema...</b>
<b>So, apart from you,</b>
<b>only your boss can open the door
to the house using that key.</b>
<b>Am I right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>It was your boss who sent you
to the bank that day.</b>
<b>- Wasn't it?
- Yes.</b>
<b>What was the purpose
of your visit to the bank?</b>
<b>I had applied for a loan
to renovate my house,</b>
<b>at the co-operative bank.</b>
<b>And the Secretary of the co-operative bank
is a friend of my boss.</b>
<b>So, it was upon his recommendation...</b>
<b>It was upon my his recommendation
that I went there.</b>
<b>That means, your boss knew in advance
that you won't be present in the house,</b>
<b>between 10:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.,
on that day.</b>
<b>- Am I right?
- Yes, he was aware of it.</b>
<b>If he had to enter the house
while you're outside,</b>
<b>your boss used to unlock the door
using his key, right?</b>
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>
<b>But my boss returned
only after I got back.</b>
<b>Didn't I tell you?</b>
<b>Respond to my questions
with just a "Yes" or a "No".</b>
<b>If your boss had come to the house
and departed before your return,</b>
<b>would you have known?</b>
<b>Would you?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Since this girl was alone at home,</b>
<b>did you lock all the doors
before leaving?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Does this house have
a door at the terrace?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>So,</b>
<b>if this girl had opened the terrace
door for someone,</b>
<b>would you know that?</b>
<b>Answer me!</b>
<b>- No!
- Ah!</b>
<b>You also cannot determine whether</b>
<b>your boss or his wife accidentally
left the door open upon leaving.</b>
<b>Tell me!</b>
<b>- No!
- No!</b>
<b>Therefore,</b>
<b>you cannot confirm whether they
deliberately left the door open either.</b>
<b>Right?</b>
<b>Why are you looking there often?
No one is going to tell you anything!</b>
<b>That's because she is scared.</b>
<b>The witness hasn't
understood the question.</b>
<b>Didn't you understand
the question?</b>
<b>No, sir.</b>
<b>Repeat the question.</b>
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>
<b>You already stated that...</b>
<b>you can't say whether your boss or
his wife accidentally left the door open.</b>
<b>- Yes.
- And therefore,</b>
<b>you can't say whether they deliberately
left the door open, either.</b>
<b>Isn't that right?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>What was the response of the parents
when you told them</b>
<b>that you had informed this to the police
before they reached?</b>
<b>I'm asking the questions to you!</b>
<b>Don't you know the consequences
of lying in the court?</b>
<b>You'll be sent to jail.</b>
<b>Her parents scolded you
for informing the police.</b>
<b>Isn't that right?</b>
<b>Yes or no?
Say it!</b>
<b>- Yes.
- So, they scolded you.</b>
<b>That's it!</b>
<b>CW2,</b>
<b>Parveen.</b>
<b>We need an in-camera trial.</b>
<b>She is the victim's mother.</b>
<b>Everyone else can step out.</b>
<b>Chechi!</b>
<b>Why is he asking all these
twisted questions?</b>
<b>He will make the prosecution witnesses
say "yes" or "no" alone.</b>
<b>If there are explanations,
the lawyer's intentions won't work.</b>
<b>This is called the art
of cross-examination.</b>
<b>Have you seen the accused
who's standing in the dock, earlier?</b>
<b>I have seen him.</b>
<b>When and where?</b>
<b>Can you please explain?</b>
<b>December 26th, Monday evening,</b>
<b>at around 3:30 - 4:00 p.m.,</b>
<b>we were having tea at our courtyard.</b>
<b>- Dad!
- Yes!</b>
<b>I'm not coming for the wedding tomorrow.</b>
<b>So, you're going to stay here alone?</b>
<b>Seema Chechi will be here, right?</b>
<b>Seema, don't you have to go
to the bank tomorrow?</b>
<b>Yes, sir. I've been asked
to go there at 11:00 a.m..</b>
<b>Excuse me!</b>
<b>Where is Vinod's house?</b>
<b>The retired registrar's son?</b>
<b>It's the neighbouring house.</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Dad, please tell me.</b>
<b>- I needn't come, right?
- If you don't want to, don't come.</b>
<b>Do as you please.</b>
<b>So, the accused may have heard</b>
<b>that your daughter would be alone
during the time of the incident,</b>
<b>from your conversation, right?</b>
<b>- Yes!
- What stupidity is this?</b>
<b>How can she determine whether
someone else heard it or not?</b>
<b>Only the person who has heard it,
can confirm it.</b>
<b>If I say that you've heard
whatever I just said here now,</b>
<b>will you be able to deny it?</b>
<b>Your Honour, what is this?</b>
<b>- Tell me!
- I heard it.</b>
<b>That's all!</b>
<b>Pardon me, for not taking permission.</b>
<b>I was trying to make a point.</b>
<b>Okay, okay.</b>
<b>You may continue.</b>
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Cross.</b>
<b>What was your husband's job?</b>
<b>Oh, I'm sorry!</b>
<b>It's not just one person.</b>
<b>Since you have many husbands, you
wouldn't know who I'm talking about, right?</b>
<b>I will ask you, one by one.</b>
<b>What was your first husband's job?</b>
<b>Car sales.</b>
<b>Broker!</b>
<b>I heard that he committed suicide
due to debts?</b>
<b>Is that right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Due to the reason that he fell into a loop
of debts and committed suicide...</b>
<b>after his love marriage with you,</b>
<b>none of his relatives are on good terms
with you, right?</b>
<b>Objection!
No relevancy!</b>
<b>It is relevant!</b>
<b>Is it my problem if you
don't understand that?</b>
<b>Let me complete.</b>
<b>Yes, continue.</b>
<b>Thank you, Your Honour.</b>
<b>After the death of your first husband,</b>
<b>you had absolutely
no means to live,</b>
<b>and that's when you met Mohammed, right?</b>
<b>- Yes.
- Ah!</b>
<b>And you were aware that Mohammed
had a wife and two children then.</b>
<b>Tell me.
Were you aware of it?</b>
<b>- Yes, I was aware.
- Okay.</b>
<b>You had come to understand
that Mohammed's financial status</b>
<b>was far better than yours.</b>
<b>- Is that right?
- Yes.</b>
<b>Yes!!</b>
<b>Women who entice married men with children,</b>
<b>especially those who
are financially well-off,</b>
<b>thereby ruining their families...</b>
<b>- Scandalous question!
- What is your problem?</b>
<b>You're always interfering without
allowing me to complete my question!</b>
<b>I'm asking a general question!</b>
<b>Prosecutor,</b>
<b>have a seat.
Let him complete.</b>
<b>Thank you, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Women who entice
married men with children,</b>
<b>especially those who
are financially well-off,</b>
<b>thereby ruining their families,</b>
<b>are often regarded as immoral
by our society.</b>
<b>In your opinion,</b>
<b>are such women immoral or not?</b>
<b>Tell me!</b>
<b>Purely character assassination!</b>
<b>Cross-examination is not a license
for character assassination.</b>
<b>Character and reputation of the victim,</b>
<b>are wholly alien
to the very scope of section</b>
<b>376 of IPC.</b>
<b>State of Haryana v/s Prem Chand,</b>
<b>1990 AR, SC 538.</b>
<b>Even prostitute has the right
to protect her person.</b>
<b>Privacy is a basic right
even for a prostitute.</b>
<b>See, you haven't even understood
what my question is.</b>
<b>And now, since you yourself
have tagged this women that way--</b>
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar,</b>
<b>you cannot make imputations
against her chastity.</b>
<b>The victim's family and background
are really important in this case.</b>
<b>So, I must ask these questions.</b>
<b>Okay. You may continue.</b>
<b>Tell me.
Is such a woman immoral or not?</b>
<b>Answer me!</b>
<b>Do you have an answer?</b>
<b>No answer.</b>
<b>Are you aware that</b>
<b>the accused in this case holds
a very high financial position?</b>
<b>Answer me!</b>
<b>Are you aware that the accused is rich?</b>
<b>- Yes!
- Yes!</b>
<b>So, she's aware of everything, clearly.</b>
<b>Counsel, conclude your cross.</b>
<b>This implies that you,</b>
<b>who remarried at the expense
of another family's well-being</b>
<b>in pursuit of
financial benefits,</b>
<b>are willing to exploit even your own
daughter for financial gains.</b>
<b>Furthermore, you have filed
a false case against this young man</b>
<b>purportedly for financial gain,</b>
<b>and are currently providing false
testimony in court.</b>
<b>I suggest so.</b>
<b>For God's sake,
please don't say so, sir.</b>
<b>- He's the one who--
- That's it!</b>
<b>You may step down.</b>
<b>Mohammed,</b>
<b>how long have you
known the victim for?</b>
<b>I am her father.</b>
<b>How many fathers does she have?</b>
<b>This is embarrassing!</b>
<b>What's the case here?</b>
<b>The blind daughter
of a father and a mother...</b>
<b>was raped heinously
by the accused.</b>
<b>And now, that family's honour
is being destroyed in the court.</b>
<b>The accused is standing with his head
held high in the same court.</b>
<b>Cannot be permitted!</b>
<b>There's no point
being emotional in court.</b>
<b>Just like the victim and her family,</b>
<b>the accused also deserves
human consideration.</b>
<b>Until the court determines
whether he's guilty or not,</b>
<b>that young man is
also being humiliated.</b>
<b>Doesn't he have emotions too?</b>
<b>Trials are emotional roller-coasters
for both the victim and the accused.</b>
<b>You should find a way to keep
your emotions out of the courtroom.</b>
<b>If you can't do that,
just quit, Mister!</b>
<b>You are not fit for this job!</b>
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar,</b>
<b>you can question properly.</b>
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Are you the girl's biological father?</b>
<b>- No!
- No!</b>
<b>When you became her father,</b>
<b>how old was Sara?</b>
<b>- Six years.
- Okay.</b>
<b>But I knew her much before that.</b>
<b>Answer only to the questions
you are asked.</b>
<b>Generally, everywhere you go,</b>
<b>do you take your daughter along?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>You didn't take her along
on that day, right?</b>
<b>That's right.</b>
<b>Wasn't it you who sent the servant
to the bank at 10:30 a.m., on that day?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>So, you knew that the servant
won't be at home,</b>
<b>between 10:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.,
on that day.</b>
<b>- Yes.
- Mohammed!</b>
<b>You had a very clear idea
about that day.</b>
<b>After sending your
wife for the wedding,</b>
<b>you went back home,</b>
<b>and did this to your foster daughter!</b>
<b>Don't speak nonsense!</b>
<b>You! You are the actual culprit
in this case. I suggest so!</b>
<b>It's a lie!
A blatant lie!</b>
<b>No further questions!</b>
<b>Actually, who left the door open?</b>
<b>It must be Dad.</b>
<b>If you're asked that,
don't say that it's your dad.</b>
<b>Say that it must be the servant,</b>
<b>or that you don't know.</b>
<b>Why should I say so?</b>
<b>What I'm going to say now,</b>
<b>won't be very pleasant to hear.</b>
<b>It's your father who assaulted you,</b>
<b>and what's happening now
is an attempt to cover that up.</b>
<b>That's what the defence
lawyer is trying to establish.</b>
<b>That...</b>
<b>I should be the one
confirming that, right?</b>
<b>I know that it's not my father
who assaulted me.</b>
<b>Moreover, I identified
the accused too, right?</b>
<b>The court needs evidence beyond doubt.</b>
<b>Sara, ours is an adversarial system.</b>
<b>Proving that the accused is the one
who committed the crime,</b>
<b>is the prosecution's obligation.</b>
<b>It's not even necessary for him
to prove his innocence.</b>
<b>If they're able to create a doubt in
the case presented by the Prosecution,</b>
<b>he can even be acquitted.</b>
<b>Along with that, they will apply
many other defensive strategies.</b>
<b>And one such defensive strategy
they've applied in this case...</b>
<b>is to allege that your father
committed this crime, Sara.</b>
<b>Hence, when you're
subjected to trial tomorrow,</b>
<b>most of their questions will lead
towards implicating your father.</b>
<b>So, pay close attention to the questions
and understand them properly.</b>
<b>And if you don't understand them,</b>
<b>just say that you
didn't understand them.</b>
<b>In case you understood the question,</b>
<b>and need time to answer
that question,</b>
<b>say that you didn't
understand the question.</b>
<b>The defence lawyer
may create a ruckus then.</b>
<b>He may pressure you
to respond to the question hastily.</b>
<b>Don't be scared hearing all that, Sara.</b>
<b>So,</b>
<b>how will I identify whether
it's a twisted question?</b>
<b>Trust me.</b>
<b>You can do it, Sara.</b>
<b>You are an intelligent girl.</b>
<b>And I will be in the court, right?</b>
<b>If I feel that you're going
wrong somewhere,</b>
<b>I will raise an objection.</b>
<b>I will pick a fight
with the defence lawyer.</b>
<b>That's a sign for you,</b>
<b>and the time for you to think
about your answer, Sara.</b>
<b>What is your name, dear?</b>
<b>Sara Mohammed.</b>
<b>Victim has spoken her name...</b>
<b>as is in the records.</b>
<b>She has been mentioned herein as "X".</b>
<b>What caused the loss of your eyesight?</b>
<b>Giant cell arteritis.</b>
<b>A condition characterized by inflammation</b>
<b>in the blood vessels that
supply blood to the eye,</b>
<b>resulting in the loss of eye-sight.</b>
<b>What are your hobbies?</b>
<b>I am a sculpture artist.</b>
<b>I learned it from a very young age.</b>
<b>Dad is an expert at it.</b>
<b>He taught it to me.</b>
<b>What do you have to say
about the incident?</b>
<b>That day,</b>
<b>I was alone at home.</b>
<b>Dad and Mom had gone for a wedding.</b>
<b>Our house-maid
had gone to the bank.</b>
<b>And then,</b>
<b>I went for a bath.</b>
<b>Once I finished my
bath and came out,</b>
<b>I sensed the presence
of someone else in the room.</b>
<b>He disrobed the towel
I was wearing.</b>
<b>He...</b>
<b>used force to push me
to the bed,</b>
<b>and held my throat and said,</b>
<b>If you make noise,
I'll slit your throat!</b>
<b>Does she feel uncomfortable?</b>
<b>Does she need a break?</b>
<b>Do you need a break?</b>
<b>- No.
- No!</b>
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Cross!</b>
<b>How do you identify things
that are around you?</b>
<b>I...</b>
<b>identify most of them
by touching them.</b>
<b>So, you rely heavily on touch
to gather information, right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Both in my life,</b>
<b>and in my art,</b>
<b>touch plays a crucial role.</b>
<b>Okay. Then, let's talk about your art.</b>
<b>So, you learned to make sculptures
from your step-father?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>How did your step-father
teach you to make sculptures?</b>
<b>I didn't understand the question.</b>
<b>I'll elaborate it then.</b>
<b>Did he teach you to create sculptures
by touching you and having you touch him?</b>
<b>It's offensive!</b>
<b>Sexually coloured remarks!</b>
<b>There's obscenity and innuendo
in the question.</b>
<b>The defence lawyer is committing
a crime as per IPC 354.</b>
<b>Victims often find
courtrooms unapproachable</b>
<b>due to such harrowing trials.</b>
<b>My question is related to the case,
with the aim of revealing the truth.</b>
<b>Defence counsel can ask questions
related to the incident.</b>
<b>Confine to facts and issue.</b>
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Will you able to recall
what happened that day?</b>
<b>Please try.</b>
<b>When you say that you ran your
fingers along the accused's face,</b>
<b>caressing it, for an extended time
during such a traumatic incident,</b>
<b>doesn't it sound unnatural?</b>
<b>Huh?</b>
<b>Engaging in caressing during an act
like rape is impossible. I suggest so!</b>
<b>I was scared...</b>
<b>and absolutely helpless.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>To identify who the culprit is,</b>
<b>I realized that's the only way
I had in front of me.</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>I turned my pain into art.</b>
<b>Whoa!</b>
<b>You turned your pain into art!</b>
<b>Good!</b>
<b>Then why didn't you tell the police
about such a possibility initially?</b>
<b>Well...</b>
<b>Tell me.</b>
<b>Well, I...</b>
<b>That means, you never created
such a sculpture.</b>
<b>- I created it.
- Mere claims won't suffice!</b>
<b>What evidence can you adduce in court
to establish that you're the creator?</b>
<b>Your Honour, this is an attempt
to discredit the victim.</b>
<b>You continue.</b>
<b>One the day of the incident,</b>
<b>no door was broken into,</b>
<b>as far as you know, right?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>He entered through
the door upstairs.</b>
<b>The police gave you
that information,</b>
<b>but you never saw it, right?</b>
<b>Otherwise, the only person
who knows this, is your father.</b>
<b>When you're subjected
to trial tomorrow,</b>
<b>most of their questions will lead
towards implicating your father.</b>
<b>- It's not like that.
- Huh?</b>
<b>Dad, Mom and even Seema Chechi knew it.</b>
<b>Mom and Seema Chechi won't leave
that door open deliberately, right?</b>
<b>- Isn't that right?
- In case you understood the question,</b>
<b>and need time to answer
that question,</b>
<b>say that you don't
understand the question.</b>
<b>I didn't understand the question.</b>
<b>How is it difficult to understand
this question?</b>
<b>Your mother or the servant will
never leave that door open deliberately.</b>
<b>Isn't that right?</b>
<b>No one will leave it open.</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>Since you're an adult,</b>
<b>you were likely aware of sexual acts
before this incident, right?</b>
<b>- I am aware.
- How?</b>
<b>Some time back,
you stated to the court...</b>
<b>that your typical way of understanding
things is through touch or experience.</b>
<b>Unfortunately, you cannot comprehend
them through sight, right?</b>
<b>I had eyesight until I was 12 years old.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>While studying in school,</b>
<b>I had received sex education.</b>
<b>Oh, good!</b>
<b>Even when girls grow older,</b>
<b>there's nothing wrong in parents
expressing their love towards them, right?</b>
<b>- No!
- No!</b>
<b>Since you are blind,</b>
<b>you must be expressing your love
towards your father...</b>
<b>through your hands, right?</b>
<b>Huh?</b>
<b>I don't understand.</b>
<b>You will be expressing it</b>
<b>by touching, caressing or hugging
him with your hands, right?</b>
<b>Not just with my father,</b>
<b>I do the same with my mother too.</b>
<b>So, you mean to say that...</b>
<b>that's how you express your love
to everyone you are fond of.</b>
<b>- Isn't it?
- Yes.</b>
<b>That means, you've never touched anyone
whom you don't like, in that manner!</b>
<b>- No!
- Ah!</b>
<b>So, from whatever
you've told the court so far,</b>
<b>you touch someone,</b>
<b>or allow someone else to touch you,</b>
<b>only when you have a sense of love
or acceptance towards them, right?</b>
<b>- I didn't mean--
- Your Honour, vehemently objecting!</b>
<b>This line of questioning
is misleading and manipulative.</b>
<b>Her inability to defend herself
due to fear of death</b>
<b>does not imply
that she gave consent!</b>
<b>This is ridiculous!</b>
<b>What kind of trial is this?</b>
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan should refrain
from disrupting the court.</b>
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan,</b>
<b>I've noted your objection.</b>
<b>You shall not interrupt the trial.</b>
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar,</b>
<b>you may proceed with your defence,</b>
<b>but rephrase your question.</b>
<b>- Yes, Your Honour.
- Sir, I shall answer that question!</b>
<b>I touch someone,</b>
<b>or allow someone else to touch me,</b>
<b>only when I have a sense of love
or acceptance towards them.</b>
<b>I didn't resist when he raped me,
solely because of the fear of death.</b>
<b>It should not be
mistaken for consent,</b>
<b>and no one has to
interpret it as consent.</b>
<b>This is quite surprising!</b>
<b>This is the first time
I'm seeing such a rape victim!</b>
<b>Remaining unfazed during a rape,
caressing the face of the rapist,</b>
<b>and subsequently speaking about
these actions in court without shame.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>we need to re-examine whether
a rape has indeed happened here.</b>
<b>The intention of this girl and her family
has also become clear now.</b>
<b>I don't think a girl who
has truly experienced rape</b>
<b>would be able to behave
in this manner.</b>
<b>How else should she behave?</b>
<b>Should she bottle up her feelings
fearing humiliation,</b>
<b>console herself
that it's all fate,</b>
<b>and remain silent?
Is that what you mean?</b>
<b>Times have changed, sir!</b>
<b>Girls of the new generation
aren't like that.</b>
<b>They will announce it,
loud and clear,</b>
<b>Who! What! And How!</b>
<b>If you cannot accept it,</b>
<b>it's because of your age
and your narrow-mindedness.</b>
<b>Better you try to change, Mr. Senior!</b>
<b>No further questions, Your Honour.</b>
<b>So, Mohammed is their target.</b>
<b>The media has enough fodder
to hold debates now.</b>
<b>We already lack media support.</b>
<b>Shall we start a campaign on social media,
supporting the survivor?</b>
<b>If we create a hype,
won't it be beneficial for us, sir?</b>
<b>It's not the media...</b>
<b>that makes decisions in the court.</b>
<b>But... it will make some impact.</b>
<b>Right?</b>
<b>I know a few social activists.</b>
<b>We'll make them write posts
on social media.</b>
<b>Ask your friends also to help us, Ashwathy.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>- Dad!
- Yes?</b>
<b>Are you tensed?</b>
<b>Not exactly.</b>
<b>Rather, alert.</b>
<b>He has been out of legal
practice for several years now.</b>
<b>A known opponent is much more dangerous
than an unknown opponent.</b>
<b>He knows my methods
and strategies very well.</b>
<b>We gotta do what we gotta do.</b>
<b>Don't worry, Dad!
You'll be great!</b>
<b>- Good morning, sir!
- Morning!</b>
<b>- Do you remember everything I told you yesterday?
- Yes, sir.</b>
<b>- Do you remember the date?
- Yes.</b>
<b>Hey! Did you meet Michael
after the police arrested him?</b>
<b>Yes, I did.</b>
<b>Mention it only if
the defence lawyer asks you.</b>
<b>On the day of the incident,
by the time you returned from church,</b>
<b>- Michael had left from your house, right?
- Yes.</b>
<b>After that, did you get in touch
with him over the phone?</b>
<b>Err... I...</b>
<b>After I got back from the church,</b>
<b>I tried contacting his phone.</b>
<b>But I couldn't reach him.</b>
<b>Do you go to church every Sunday?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Do you guys hang out
at your friends' place,</b>
<b>during the St. Ignatius Church festival?</b>
<b>Yes. On the day of the festival,</b>
<b>our families and friends
gather to celebrate together.</b>
<b>When you went for the church
festival this time,</b>
<b>didn't you take Michael along?</b>
<b>No. Michael had left
early in the morning itself.</b>
<b>He had to go somewhere urgently.</b>
<b>That's it.</b>
<b>There's an ambiguity in the date.
I need to clarify that.</b>
<b>I need a re.</b>
<b>There is no ambiguity so far.</b>
<b>The witness has
clearly stated that...</b>
<b>on the day of
the St. Ignatius church festival,</b>
<b>Michael left Vinod's
house in the morning.</b>
<b>He said the truth.</b>
<b>He maybe a planted witness.</b>
<b>You can clarify it.</b>
<b>Re.</b>
<b>Did Michael leave on Tuesday
or Wednesday?</b>
<b>Well, I'm unable to say that now.</b>
<b>I don't remember correctly.</b>
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>
<b>You may step down.</b>
<b>Chechi, why did you say
that Vinod betrayed us?</b>
<b>He mentioned a different date, right?</b>
<b>As per the Prosecution story,</b>
<b>Michael reached Vinod's house on the 26th,</b>
<b>and this incident happened
during the day, on 27th.</b>
<b>But as per what Vinod said now,</b>
<b>Michael returned on the day
of the church festival.</b>
<b>That is, on the 26th.</b>
<b>When 27th becomes 26th,</b>
<b>there will be a conflict
in the Prosecution story.</b>
<b>That will be a point
for the defence, right?</b>
<b>Chechi, social media
is raging up, by the way.</b>
<b>I noticed.</b>
<b>That's not enough.
We need to flare it up!</b>
<b>- My friends are all actively involved.
- Very good.</b>
<b>Thumba rape case.</b>
<b>A blind girl has been assaulted.</b>
<b>A significant amount of time
has passed.</b>
<b>We are discussing this topic now.</b>
<b>The Prosecution changed sides...</b>
<b>and took a stand favourable
to the culprit. That's why...</b>
<b>the accused got bail from the court
after fourteen days,</b>
<b>and came out of jail.</b>
<b>Even before the court
declares the judgement,</b>
<b>you are creating a
preconceived notion</b>
<b>that the male is indeed the
perpetrator, most of the time.</b>
<b>It's natural that
when such cases occur,</b>
<b>the survivors have to endure
a great deal of suffering.</b>
<b>Even their names are taken
away from these girls.</b>
<b>Nobody mentions their names.
They are all Nirbhayas,</b>
<b>or Kadamakudis,</b>
<b>or the girl from Chandranelli.</b>
<b>I'm leaving.</b>
<b>What is this, dude?</b>
<b>I didn't tell my parents
that I'm coming here.</b>
<b>I'll call and tell them
that you'll be late.</b>
<b>No, no.</b>
<b>If they know that I am with you...</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>So, I'm a bad guy!</b>
<b>If you hang out with me,
even you will become bad, right?</b>
<b>Michael, it's not like that.</b>
<b>- Since the case is going on...
- I understand!</b>
<b>Get going.</b>
<b>Ah! It's her!</b>
<b>My fiancee!</b>
<b>Hi, dear.</b>
<b>[in Hindi] Where are you?</b>
<b>[in Hindi] I am at home.</b>
<b>Aren't you on social media these days?</b>
<b>I had sent you some links.</b>
<b>- You wouldn't have seen them.
- What happened?</b>
<b>You've become so famous, right?</b>
<b>Now, my parents are
rethinking of this marriage.</b>
<b>Even a blind girl is assaulted.</b>
<b>Why aren't the law and the court reacting?
That's my question!</b>
<b>How is this guy able to do this?</b>
<b>Is he even human?</b>
<b>- What is it?
- Such guys should not be spared.</b>
<b>They should be beaten to death.</b>
<b>What's the point of reactions, bro?</b>
<b>There should be action.
He should be hanged. That's all!</b>
<b>He's going to marry the Central Minister's
daughter. Will anyone punish him?</b>
<b>Even such guys are getting married!</b>
<b>How long will we live in fear?</b>
<b>They deserve capital punishment.</b>
<b>Rapists should be castrated.
That's all.</b>
<b>He should be shot dead.</b>
<b>Even I saw some
news on social media.</b>
<b>It's growing day by day.</b>
<b>We'll have to do
something about this.</b>
<b>There was nothing
when the case started.</b>
<b>And if it has started flaring up now,
they are behind this!</b>
<b>It's a clear case of...</b>
<b>character assassination.</b>
<b>13 years back,
I had mentioned once...</b>
<b>that this curry is good.</b>
<b>She's been serving the
same curry ever since.</b>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>Mom!</b>
<b>- Dad!
- Let go of me!</b>
<b>Dad!</b>
<b>Dad!</b>
<b>Dad!</b>
<b>Mom!</b>
<b>Mom!</b>
<b>Mom!</b>
<b>What did you think?</b>
<b>Did you think I would stay
behind bars if you filed a case?</b>
<b>Instead of accepting the money
and reaching a settlement,</b>
<b>you're trying to mess with me?</b>
<b>Both social media and the court...</b>
<b>can't do squat to me!</b>
<b>So, you better withdraw the case.</b>
<b>Or else,</b>
<b>just like I showed up that day,</b>
<b>I'll show up again.</b>
<b>Understood?</b>
<b>Do you now realize...</b>
<b>what all I can do?</b>
<b>I've fixed a price
for your daughter's honour.</b>
<b>You better accept that money
and end all this drama.</b>
<b>Or else,</b>
<b>I will torch you alive!</b>
<b>All three of you!</b>
<b>My child!</b>
<b>My dear...</b>
<b>Don't worry.</b>
<b>How idiotic and disappointing!</b>
<b>I thought you were sensible.</b>
<b>We're trying to get you
out of the case somehow,</b>
<b>and you're creating
new complications?</b>
<b>I thought they might withdraw
the case, if I scare them.</b>
<b>As if they've withdrawn now!</b>
<b>Now they are going
to cancel your bail.</b>
<b>No one has seen that incident.</b>
<b>I was very careful about it.</b>
<b>So what?</b>
<b>- They can't prove it in the court.
- Do you get to decide that?</b>
<b>Shut up!</b>
<b>After acting so recklessly,
you're bragging about it now?</b>
<b>I know how to conduct this case.</b>
<b>I don't need your help to do it.</b>
<b>- Yeah, Dad!
- Dear...</b>
<b>Can you appear for this case on June 5th?</b>
<b>I'm scheduled for a hearing
on Arun Malhotra's case that day.</b>
<b>It's the Chief Justice's bench.
That's why.</b>
<b>I have a posting on that day...</b>
<b>- but it's okay. I will manage.
- Okay!</b>
<b>Where's your father?</b>
<b>He has an important hearing
in the Supreme Court.</b>
<b>Okay! You may continue.</b>
<b>Thank you, Your Honour!</b>
<b>Your Honour, this is preposterous.</b>
<b>Realizing that they're not
going to win the case,</b>
<b>they've fabricated a false case
to have the bail revoked.</b>
<b>When there is an accusation,</b>
<b>what the court needs is evidence.</b>
<b>And if, as per the Prosecution's assertion,
such an incident really took place,</b>
<b>they are free to lodge
a new FIR for investigation.</b>
<b>It has absolutely no connection
with the bail petition in this case.</b>
<b>Mr. Prosecutor!</b>
<b>This is a matter
to be investigated.</b>
<b>Your Honour! It's a fact that
they came and threatened them,</b>
<b>covertly in the dark, like cowards.</b>
<b>As long as this accused
is freely roaming outside,</b>
<b>the victim and her family
are not safe.</b>
<b>That's the reason why
we had to file such a petition.</b>
<b>- Just because there is no evidence--
- Mr. Vijayamohan!</b>
<b>I can understand your concern.</b>
<b>So, now you want to ensure...</b>
<b>the safety of the victim
and her family, right?</b>
<b>We can enrol them into
Victim Protection Scheme,</b>
<b>and provide Police protection
for them.</b>
<b>That solves the issue, right?</b>
<b>As a Public Prosecutor,</b>
<b>I can get the State to give
them police protection.</b>
<b>But that's not why
I moved this petition--</b>
<b>Call next witness!</b>
<b>Where do you work?</b>
<b>At Trivandrum General Hospital.</b>
<b>As part of this case,</b>
<b>you have examined the victim, right?</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>This certificate has your seal
and signature.</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Exhibit P3.</b>
<b>Cross!</b>
<b>During a non-consensual, forceful act,</b>
<b>injury is quite natural, right?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Also, when the intercourse is performed
forcefully without consent,</b>
<b>there will be injuries, right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>There are no such injuries mentioned,</b>
<b>in this certificate.</b>
<b>That's right.</b>
<b>To prove that a complete sexual
intercourse had indeed occurred,</b>
<b>the only prevailing scientific method ...</b>
<b>is the presence of semen.</b>
<b>Even that does not exist
in this case.</b>
<b>- That's right.
- That's all, Your Honour!</b>
<b>Thank you, Doctor!</b>
<b>What is the date on which the accused
went to CW3 victim's house,</b>
<b>as inferred from your investigation?</b>
<b>26.12.2022, Monday.</b>
<b>How did you identify the accused?</b>
<b>We identified the accused
from the sculpture of the accused,</b>
<b>created by the
petitioner of this case.</b>
<b>Did you take the original
sculpture into custody,</b>
<b>recording it as M.O.?</b>
<b>As the sculpture is a breakable object,</b>
<b>we photographed it
from various angles,</b>
<b>documented them
and the memory cards in the Mahazar,</b>
<b>obtained sanction from the court
and safely stored them at the station.</b>
<b>After that, I had to hand over
the investigation.</b>
<b>Cross!</b>
<b>When were you relieved from
your role in this investigation?</b>
<b>On 20th February.</b>
<b>If I say that your investigation
was heading in the wrong direction,</b>
<b>and that's why you were
dropped from this case...</b>
<b>- Isn't that right?
- No!</b>
<b>You stated during the examination-in-chief
that the sculpture was photographed.</b>
<b>Can you adduce those photos in court?</b>
<b>It's not present in the CD any more.</b>
<b>Since those photos didn't have
any resemblance to the accused,</b>
<b>you removed them deliberately.</b>
<b>I did not remove them.</b>
<b>When I handed over the investigation,</b>
<b>those photos and the memory card
were still present at the station.</b>
<b>I don't know where it vanished
after that.</b>
<b>Has the CD leaked, PP?</b>
<b>Regarding the aforementioned sculpture,</b>
<b>who informed you first?</b>
<b>The girl's father, Mohammed.</b>
<b>And the first person who
showed this sculpture to you,</b>
<b>was also Mohammed, right?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>You were aware that Mohammed
is a skilled sculpture artist, right?</b>
<b>Yes, I was aware.</b>
<b>The one who told you that the sculpture
resembled the accused,</b>
<b>was Mohammed, right?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>And it was Mohammed who first told you that
it was the girl who made the sculpture.</b>
<b>The girl had also confirmed it.</b>
<b>Who was the first to say that?
That's what I asked you.</b>
<b>It was Mohammed.</b>
<b>The sculpture was not made...</b>
<b>in your presence, right?</b>
<b>Err... No!</b>
<b>And hence,</b>
<b>you cannot confirm that...</b>
<b>it was not Mohammed
who made that sculpture.</b>
<b>Didn't you understand
the question?</b>
<b>No! I cannot!</b>
<b>That's it!</b>
<b>In this case,</b>
<b>on 20.02.2023,</b>
<b>the investigation was handed over to me.</b>
<b>I obtained the chemical examination
report and submitted it in court.</b>
<b>I acquired the tower locations
of the accused's phone,</b>
<b>and submitted it in court.</b>
<b>After that, I prepared the charge-sheet
against the accused,</b>
<b>and submitted it before the court.</b>
<b>The photos supposedly clicked by
the police photographer on 28.12.2022...</b>
<b>Have you seen them?</b>
<b>When the case was handed over to me,
there were no photos.</b>
<b>From his call details,</b>
<b>didn't you infer that that the accused
was not present at the crime spot?</b>
<b>It's the responsibility of the Nodal Officer
to provide that testimony.</b>
<b>The Prosecution hasn't examined
the Nodal Officer in court.</b>
<b>Are you not aware of it?</b>
<b>It's the Prosecutor who decides
whom he wants to examine;</b>
<b>not the investigating officer.</b>
<b>At the time when the incident
allegedly happened,</b>
<b>the accused was travelling to attend
a party organised by his friends,</b>
<b>from Thiruvananthapuram to Kanthalloor.</b>
<b>Are you not aware of that information?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>That's it!</b>
<b>Prosecutor!</b>
<b>Are you marking the call records?</b>
<b>- No!
- He won't mark them.</b>
<b>The case will lose credibility then.</b>
<b>Evidence of prosecution is closed
for questioning the accused,</b>
<b>under Section 313,</b>
<b>of CrPC.</b>
<b>Posted on,</b>
<b>23.06.23</b>
<b>PW1, the servant said that...</b>
<b>as per information gathered from PW3
on the day of the incident,</b>
<b>the girl told her that she was threatened
and raped without her consent.</b>
<b>It is alleged so.</b>
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>It is also alleged that
the sculpture of the accused</b>
<b>made by the complainant
of this case,</b>
<b>is what made the police
identify you as the accused.</b>
<b>That's not right!</b>
<b>Additionally, it is alleged that
PW5 identified you as the accused</b>
<b>and documented
the FIR as Exhibit P1.</b>
<b>I don't know!</b>
<b>It is alleged that PW6
concluded his investigation,</b>
<b>and presented the charge-sheet
of the same.</b>
<b>I don't know!</b>
<b>Do you want to say anything further?</b>
<b>I am absolutely innocent in this case.</b>
<b>On the day the incident
supposedly happened,</b>
<b>I left Vinod's house
early in the morning itself,</b>
<b>to attend a party arranged
by my friends at Kanthalloor.</b>
<b>After that, while I was
waiting at the airport,</b>
<b>to travel to Amsterdam, I was arrested.</b>
<b>I am innocent.</b>
<b>Do you have evidence
and witnesses to prove it?</b>
<b>Yes! I shall produce them.</b>
<b>Filing 233 statement
along with witness schedule.</b>
<b>To corroborate that,</b>
<b>I shall produce all...</b>
<b>available materials.</b>
<b>Can I post it on...</b>
<b>08.07.2023?</b>
<b>- Yes, Your Honour!
- Will Mr. Rajashekhar be present then?</b>
<b>He'll be there, Your Honour!</b>
<b>He will be back this evening.</b>
<b>Ahaana!</b>
<b>Verify the tower locations
of the route...</b>
<b>through which Michael
claims to have travelled.</b>
<b>If we find a tower location
which is not in Muvattupuzha,</b>
<b>it will benefit us.</b>
<b>The towers are accurate.</b>
<b>Michael's number was latched on
to all of them, right?</b>
<b>Yes! I verified it.</b>
<b>Ahaana!</b>
<b>Call Paul Varghese...</b>
<b>and ask him to procure an information
from the cyber department.</b>
<b>The first defence witness
is one of Michael's friends.</b>
<b>He claims that they had food together
from Empire Hotel in Muvattupuzha,</b>
<b>on the day of the incident.</b>
<b>The name of the friend whom
they apparently met over there...</b>
<b>is Mr. Naveen.</b>
<b>I need all the details about that guy.</b>
<b>Ahaana!</b>
<b>The resort in Kanthalloor...</b>
<b>where the accused Michael and friends
claim to have had a get-together?</b>
<b>- You must go there and inquire.
- Okay.</b>
<b>I can't find the CCTV footage
of the hotel anywhere here.</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>The Empire Hotel is a three-star-hotel.</b>
<b>How can such a hotel
not have CCTV cameras?</b>
<b>Well, the hard disc got corrupted.</b>
<b>Didn't you try to retrieve the data?</b>
<b>We did try upon the hotel's instructions,</b>
<b>but we were
unable to retrieve it.</b>
<b>Do you have the hard disc with you?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>- What's your name?
- Naveen.</b>
<b>What do you do, Naveen?</b>
<b>I run a workshop
for second-hand cars.</b>
<b>- Where?
- In Muvattupuzha.</b>
<b>Do you know that young man?</b>
<b>Yes, I know him.
It's Michael.</b>
<b>He's my friend.</b>
<b>We studied together in Mumbai.</b>
<b>When was the last time
you saw Michael?</b>
<b>December 27th, 2022.</b>
<b>At what time?</b>
<b>Around noon,
at 12:00 p.m..</b>
<b>Where was this?</b>
<b>At Muvattupuzha.</b>
<b>We accidentally bumped into
each other in the town.</b>
<b>After that, we had lunch from
Empire hotel before we parted ways.</b>
<b>Where did Michael mention
he was going?</b>
<b>Michael said that his friends
had planned a get-together.</b>
<b>So, he left saying that
he needs to attend it.</b>
<b>That's all, Your Honour!</b>
<b>Cross!</b>
<b>I have no questions for the time being.</b>
<b>I reserve my right...</b>
<b>to recall this witness later.</b>
<b>PP! What is your intention?</b>
<b>Your Honour, the CCTV footage
from that hotel has not reached the court,</b>
<b>and I find that really abnormal.</b>
<b>You are right.</b>
<b>That's quite unfortunate.</b>
<b>By the time we approached
them for the footage,</b>
<b>their hard disc had been corrupted.</b>
<b>We tried our level best to retrieve,</b>
<b>but we were unable to.</b>
<b>I humbly request this Honourable Court,</b>
<b>to direct the Police,</b>
<b>to recover the hard disc.</b>
<b>Your Honour!</b>
<b>We did try our level best
to retrieve it.</b>
<b>It's a waste of time.</b>
<b>They can examine the remaining
witnesses in the defence list.</b>
<b>I think, that will be enough.</b>
<b>Prosecution is directed to produce
the CCTV footage.</b>
<b>May not be, Your Honour!</b>
<b>Then it will be an unending process.</b>
<b>Though CCTV footage is absent,
we have witnesses, right?</b>
<b>That's sufficient to prove the alibi.</b>
<b>I am posting it on...</b>
<b>19.07.2023.</b>
<b>Prosecutor, you must submit
the footage on that day.</b>
<b>- Mom!
- Dear!</b>
<b>What happened?
Did you get scared?</b>
<b>I came in here
to keep your clothes.</b>
<b>Don't be scared, okay?</b>
<b>Are you the one who
produced the hard disc?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Upon whose instruction
did you do it?</b>
<b>As instructed by the Police.</b>
<b>Is this the hard disc
you handed over to the Police?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>May be marked as MO 1.</b>
<b>Have you retrieved
the footage from it?</b>
<b>Yes, we've retrieved it.
We got it only now.</b>
<b>May be marked as...</b>
<b>Exhibit P7.</b>
<b>When we requested for the visuals
from this hard disc,</b>
<b>what did you tell us?</b>
<b>That the file was corrupted.</b>
<b>Though we tried to retrieve
those visuals,</b>
<b>we were unable to do it.</b>
<b>That's all, Your Honour!</b>
<b>There are many folders in this.</b>
<b>How do we find the visuals
that we need to see, from this?</b>
<b>They are saved as clips
up to four hours.</b>
<b>So,</b>
<b>in a day, there will be six clips.</b>
<b>Please come here.</b>
<b>I need to see the clips
from the 27th.</b>
<b>From which camera, sir?</b>
<b>PP!</b>
<b>Which camera should we check?</b>
<b>The camera at the reception desk,</b>
<b>and clips from 12:00 p.m. onwards.</b>
<b>Show the clips from the restaurant
from the specified time.</b>
<b>Your Honour!</b>
<b>As the CCTV footage
suffers from no infirmity,</b>
<b>it's a vital piece of evidence,</b>
<b>and stands superior to human testimony.</b>
<b>It's now clear that the testimony
of PW 4 Vinod,</b>
<b>substantiates these visuals.</b>
<b>- Sir!
- Don't talk to me!</b>
<b>This is all because of you!</b>
<b>I need to talk to you.</b>
<b>I don't have anything to talk.</b>
<b>You need not talk.</b>
<b>But I can say what I want to say, right?</b>
<b>Why are you getting mad at me?</b>
<b>Having set-backs in cases
is nothing new, right?</b>
<b>It was not by chance, right?</b>
<b>You made it happen!</b>
<b>What wrong did I do?</b>
<b>- I need to know that.
- They are lying.</b>
<b>- Isn't that what you told me?
- Yes!</b>
<b>- I presumed so!
- Not presumptions, but we need surety.</b>
<b>You shouldn't have let me done something
that you were not sure about.</b>
<b>This is Rajashekhar's game.</b>
<b>Because of you,
I got caught up in this.</b>
<b>Because of me?</b>
<b>Who worked with him
for a long time?</b>
<b>Was that me?</b>
<b>- You couldn't see it coming!
- Yes!</b>
<b>I lack that ability,</b>
<b>which is why I
declined this case.</b>
<b>Who compelled me to take up this case?</b>
<b>Err... Okay!</b>
<b>Okay, I am sorry.</b>
<b>I should have been more careful.</b>
<b>I admit it.</b>
<b>I said, I am sorry!</b>
<b>What can we do now?</b>
<b>I've filed an application
to examine those CCTV visuals.</b>
<b>Let the results come.</b>
<b>I want the original footage
and original story.</b>
<b>What original footage?</b>
<b>What story?</b>
<b>- You, bloody--
- Sir!</b>
<b>For giving a false testimony
and tampering with material evidence,</b>
<b>I am going to arrest you.</b>
<b>You will be imprisoned for seven years
in accordance with Section 193.</b>
<b>- This is enough to shut this place down!
- Sir!</b>
<b>They forced me to do it, sir.</b>
<b>- Please help me!
- How do we help you?</b>
<b>You should have thought about it
before doing all this for money.</b>
<b>- Come, let's go.
- Sir...</b>
<b>- Sir, Please hear me out.
- What do you want to say?</b>
<b>Sir, I swear!</b>
<b>I didn't do it for money.</b>
<b>They had offered me money.</b>
<b>When I said I can't do it,</b>
<b>- they threatened me into doing it.
- You fool!</b>
<b>Now it's just you, who is
going to be imprisoned.</b>
<b>Is there any evidence
against them? No!</b>
<b>But there's evidence
for what you have done.</b>
<b>Sir, if I adduce
evidence against them,</b>
<b>will you rescue me?</b>
<b>Honestly I had no
interest in this, sir.</b>
<b>- Stop acting smart and come with me.
- Sir, Sir!</b>
<b>What evidence?</b>
<b>Earlier, when I had done something
similar to help my friend,</b>
<b>in the end he escaped
and I got trapped.</b>
<b>Anticipating the same
in this case,</b>
<b>I had done something
to save myself.</b>
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan,</b>
<b>what is the purpose
of recalling that witness?</b>
<b>Some more visuals
that need to be added</b>
<b>to the already submitted visuals,
have been procured now.</b>
<b>As far as this case is concerned,</b>
<b>these visuals are very important.</b>
<b>So, kindly allow the 311 petition.</b>
<b>I have strong objection
to allow that petition.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>prosecution has asserted
in this 311 petition that,</b>
<b>in connection with the
newly obtained materials,</b>
<b>they need to ask a few questions,</b>
<b>which is certainly
a vague assertion.</b>
<b>If the Honourable Court entertains this,</b>
<b>there will be no end
to the trial of this case.</b>
<b>Because, in every stage of the case,</b>
<b>the prosecution or the defendant</b>
<b>can cite such silly reasons,</b>
<b>and continue to call
more witnesses to the court.</b>
<b>Finding the truth,</b>
<b>is the primary objective of the court.</b>
<b>To do that, if it is essential
to recall witnesses,</b>
<b>the court must do that.</b>
<b>Evidences that are powerful enough
to change the course of this case,</b>
<b>are awaiting
the Honourable Court's permission.</b>
<b>Petition allowed.</b>
<b>I was under threat.</b>
<b>Has that threat disappeared now?</b>
<b>Sir, I created the new visuals
out of fear.</b>
<b>Play the visual.</b>
<b>Your Honour, Exhibit D4.</b>
<b>The CCTV footage that was adduced
as evidence by the defendants.</b>
<b>This is a manipulated video footage.</b>
<b>I will explain.</b>
<b>Your Honour, in the original footage
of the day when the incident happened,</b>
<b>they mark two points post 12:00 p.m.,
when the restaurant is empty.</b>
<b>After deleting the portion
in between those two points,</b>
<b>visuals shot in the same camera
for the same duration,</b>
<b>were edited and inserted after
changing the date and timeline.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>on the mirror at this side,</b>
<b>where the hallway leads
to the kitchen from the restaurant,</b>
<b>a vessel is placed on a table.</b>
<b>Is it visible to you?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Now, I shall play this.</b>
<b>That vessel...</b>
<b>has vanished now.</b>
<b>This is the first editing point.</b>
<b>Now, once Michael and his friend
have left the place,</b>
<b>let's examine the portion where
the restaurant becomes empty again.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>please look carefully at the table
where the vessel was kept.</b>
<b>The vessel has magically reappeared
at the same spot.</b>
<b>This is the second editing point.</b>
<b>Your Honour,
though they perfectly shot visuals...</b>
<b>at the restaurant
and the reception,</b>
<b>and inserted them
into the footage,</b>
<b>the reflection on this mirror...</b>
<b>betrayed them.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>he has to be punished with maximum
sentence for deceiving the court.</b>
<b>- I did it upon your instruction, sir.
- Are you lying again?</b>
<b>I'll make sure you'll be put
behind the bars.</b>
<b>We'll soon decide who will end up
going to jail, Advocate.</b>
<b>In the same pen drive,</b>
<b>there's another visual as well.</b>
<b>The Honourable Court must watch it.</b>
<b>Forward it a bit.</b>
<b>- This time duration...
- Yeah.</b>
<b>You must place the visuals
shot by me, in this gap.</b>
<b>I shall do it, Sir.</b>
<b>And then, you must give it
to me as a single footage.</b>
<b>Okay, sir.</b>
<b>This is the visual of those
footages being edited...</b>
<b>by the defence lawyer
standing beside me,</b>
<b>under his instruction and
supervision, at his office.</b>
<b>The witness, who was aware...</b>
<b>of the consequences
of creating false evidence,</b>
<b>was threatened by them
into committing this act.</b>
<b>Under a notion that it could prove
harmful for him in the future,</b>
<b>he had shot this particular visual
as a precaution.</b>
<b>This is absurd.</b>
<b>The witness is not trustworthy.</b>
<b>Earlier, he had deceived the court
by producing manipulated visuals.</b>
<b>Now, he is here with another visual.</b>
<b>Manipulating the court,</b>
<b>by burying the truth,</b>
<b>is not the job of a defence lawyer.</b>
<b>If misleading the court
becomes your habit,</b>
<b>the court will realize it
sooner or later.</b>
<b>And its consequences will be borne
by your clients and not you!</b>
<b>You may lose your brief,</b>
<b>but never lose your conscience.</b>
<b>Your Honour, if you peruse the
records of the previous cases...</b>
<b>conducted by this defence lawyer,</b>
<b>you can observe episodes
of similar manipulations.</b>
<b>Hence, I pray this Honourable Court,</b>
<b>to take appropriate action,</b>
<b>against the defence lawyer.</b>
<b>I will recommend the
bar council to enquire into,</b>
<b>and initiate proceedings
against the defence lawyer.</b>
<b>Aggrieved party can approach
the Police for necessary action.</b>
<b>Mr. Circle Inspector,</b>
<b>you need not wait for an order
to issue an FIR and begin investigation.</b>
<b>You can initiate the proceedings.</b>
<b>You may step down.</b>
<b>- Sir..
- Yeah.</b>
<b>I am so happy today.</b>
<b>I had seen a similar sight,
many years ago.</b>
<b>But it was you, in place
of Rajashekhar back then.</b>
<b>Now, I believe in Karma.</b>
<b>Sir! Sir!</b>
<b>Take a look!</b>
<b>This comment.</b>
<b>We need to trace this person.</b>
<b>As per his Facebook ID,
he is a Malayali based in Mumbai.</b>
<b>I will go, in person.</b>
<b>That's better.</b>
<b>Breaking news!</b>
<b>Against the defence lawyer of Thumba
rape case, Advocate Rajashekhar,</b>
<b>the police has registered an FIR,</b>
<b>by imposing Sections 191, 193,</b>
<b>340 and 468 of the IPC.</b>
<b>The police are proceeding with further
actions, including interrogation.</b>
<b>A girl who was subjected to grave cruelty,</b>
<b>approaches the Court to seek justice.</b>
<b>But what happens there;
with the backing of money and power</b>
<b>false evidences are being adduced,</b>
<b>and proceedings carried out,</b>
<b>for the accused to escape.</b>
<b>When that's happening,
how will justice be served?</b>
<b>When such criminal lawyers,</b>
<b>repeatedly conduct criminal cases,</b>
<b>their character and their behaviour,</b>
<b>transitions into a crime...
like that of a criminal.</b>
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar is a perfect
example for the same.</b>
<b>Therefore, it is unfair for him
to continue with this case.</b>
<b>[The fame that he achieved being
an enigmatic lawyer in the society...]</b>
<b>His arrogance was over the roof!</b>
<b>He deserves it.</b>
<b>He has tortured so many people.</b>
<b>He will walk scot-free
from all of this.</b>
<b>What can the Bar Council do?</b>
<b>- That's right.
- Ultimately, nothing will happen.</b>
<b>Haven't we seen this
so many times?</b>
<b>How come he took up the plea of alibi as
defence, despite being a senior lawyer?</b>
<b>Desperation!</b>
<b>On one side, there's
a high profile client.</b>
<b>He has to rescue the client's son,
come what may.</b>
<b>On the other side,
it's Vijayamohan.</b>
<b>Rather than losing to him,
it's better to hang himself.</b>
<b>Whatever it is,
everything is flaring up quite a bit.</b>
<b>That's true.</b>
<b>I met the person and spoke to him.</b>
<b>It's a vague information.</b>
<b>I am on my way to Bandra Police Station
to gather more details.</b>
<b>What's the update there?</b>
<b>Thumba Rape case reaches
a crucial turning point.</b>
<b>Though names of leading lawyers of the
Supreme Court were distinctly heard of,</b>
<b>instead of Advocate Rajashekhar,
who was subject to the scandal,</b>
<b>his daughter, a leading lawyer
and activist in the country,</b>
<b>Advocate Poornima Rajashekhar,
has taken up the case,</b>
<b>and that's the latest news
that has emerged now.</b>
<b>He has come again
even after being ousted.</b>
<b>But he hasn't been
punished yet, right?</b>
<b>He is still a lawyer in court.</b>
<b>But shouldn't he have some shame?</b>
<b>Seems like he's on an ego-trip.</b>
<b>He must be planning to do back-seat driving
using his daughter as a front.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>fabricating CCTV footage
before the court,</b>
<b>is fatal, as far as
this case is concerned.</b>
<b>Plea of Alibi.</b>
<b>The plea of the defence
that the accused was not present</b>
<b>in the place of crime at the time
of its occurrence, is baseless now.</b>
<b>This is a matter to be investigated
into and decided by the court.</b>
<b>Only the defence counsel
has changed;</b>
<b>not the defence.</b>
<b>The CCTV footage
of the accused, Michael...</b>
<b>arriving at PW 4 Vinod's house,
on the day before the incident,</b>
<b>and leaving from there
at dawn in the same car;</b>
<b>and the tower locations
of Michael's phone...</b>
<b>All these are valid evidences.</b>
<b>And to substantiate,</b>
<b>we have a key witness, Your Honour!</b>
<b>What is your name?</b>
<b>Shijumon!</b>
<b>You are Airtel's Nodal Officer, right?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Could you tell us what this is?</b>
<b>These are the company records
of the timings and the locations</b>
<b>of the Airtel towers that the number
906132581 was latched on to,</b>
<b>on the 27th.</b>
<b>From this, we can assume that the owner
of the number 9061312581,</b>
<b>left at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday,
27.12.2022,</b>
<b>from Thiruvananthapuram,</b>
<b>and reached Kanthalloor
by evening 3:30 p.m.</b>
<b>- Yes!
- May be recorded as question.</b>
<b>No! It's my suggestion.</b>
<b>This witness...</b>
<b>can assert only the location
of the tower.</b>
<b>But how can he confirm...</b>
<b>that the owner of the phone
had travelled on that particular day?</b>
<b>Objection sustained!</b>
<b>- On your left! Left!
- Where?</b>
<b>Come over!</b>
<b>Get down!</b>
<b>These are the CCTV footages
of various locations,</b>
<b>on the alleged day
of 27th December.</b>
<b>We can substantiate
one fact from this.</b>
<b>At the time when the incident
supposedly occurred,</b>
<b>Michael had been travelling in his car.</b>
<b>Your Honour! Filing a 311 petition,</b>
<b>to examine an additional witness,</b>
<b>to unveil a valid information.</b>
<b>This is a new evidence.</b>
<b>Can't be permitted.</b>
<b>During the defence's
examination of evidence,</b>
<b>adducing evidence to destroy
the defence is not permitted.</b>
<b>Further evidence can be let in,
only after further investigation.</b>
<b>Section 311, CrPC.</b>
<b>To deliver a flawless
verdict in a case,</b>
<b>the Honourable Court...</b>
<b>can examine any witness,
at any stage, during the case.</b>
<b>It is the Court's decision.</b>
<b>Not yours, Madam!</b>
<b>But this will cause prejudice
to the accused, Your Honour!</b>
<b>Anyway, let the witness come.</b>
<b>We will decide after that.</b>
<b>Is the witness available now?</b>
<b>Yes, Your Honour!
He is here.</b>
<b>What is Vijayamohan aiming at?</b>
<b>He told the entire truth to me.</b>
<b>But I don't think
he will say it here.</b>
<b>What is your name?</b>
<b>Robin.</b>
<b>Robin!</b>
<b>Do you know the accused in this case,
the one who's standing at the dock?</b>
<b>Yes, I know him.</b>
<b>How are you connected to him?</b>
<b>I am a driver at CJ group of companies.</b>
<b>He is their man, right?</b>
<b>Prosecutor, what is your intention
behind examining him?</b>
<b>Seeking permission under
Section 154 of the Evidence Act.</b>
<b>To put leading questions to the witness,</b>
<b>since he is the driver of the accused.</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>Permission granted!</b>
<b>Thank you, Your Honour!</b>
<b>Are you a permanent
driver at CJ group?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>How many offices does CJ group have?
And at which office do you work?</b>
<b>They have offices in Ernakulam
and Thiruvananthapuram.</b>
<b>I am the driver at Thiruvananthapuram.</b>
<b>On Tuesday, the 27th of December,</b>
<b>can you tell me where you were?</b>
<b>I was at my house.</b>
<b>Are you sure about it?</b>
<b>Yeah, sure! I was at home.</b>
<b>I was on leave for Christmas.</b>
<b>See! I told you, right?</b>
<b>Does this BSNL number belong to you?</b>
<b>Err... Yes!</b>
<b>This is Michael's phone number, right?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Mobile phones belonging
to both Michael and you...</b>
<b>On Tuesday, December 27th,</b>
<b>between morning 6 a.m
and evening 3.30 p.m,</b>
<b>they were at the same locations,
during the same timings,</b>
<b>and were found to be latched on
to their respective operators' towers.</b>
<b>Could you explain how this happened?</b>
<b>I... I don't know!</b>
<b>On the day of the incident,
that is, on 27.12.22,</b>
<b>you were driving a car with
the registration KL-07 AZ 7,</b>
<b>and this is a photograph of the same.</b>
<b>We weren't given
copies of the photo.</b>
<b>We shall serve you the copies;
first let the witness confirm it.</b>
<b>This is examination-in-chief
and not cross examination.</b>
<b>If it's a prosecution document,
they must serve the copy.</b>
<b>Yes! I agree with her.</b>
<b>Serve them the copy!</b>
<b>But I need to serve it
only if I'm marking it, right?</b>
<b>May I continue?</b>
<b>He is bluffing.</b>
<b>It can't be that photo.</b>
<b>If I say that there's evidence to prove
that you were driving Michael's car</b>
<b>on the day of the incident,
can you deny it?</b>
<b>Huh?</b>
<b>Don't look there.</b>
<b>Look at the Judge
and answer the question.</b>
<b>I can deny it.</b>
<b>I never drove that car
on that day.</b>
<b>Any further questions?</b>
<b>Mr.Robin, on the day of the incident,
at around 6.00 a.m.,</b>
<b>you went to Kanthalloor driving
Michael's car, as per his instruction.</b>
<b>Michael was not present in the car
at that point of time.</b>
<b>No... It's not like that.</b>
<b>What do you mean?
Michael wasn't present?</b>
<b>He is confusing the witness.</b>
<b>He is not confused!</b>
<b>Answer it!</b>
<b>I didn't understand the question.</b>
<b>While you were driving the accused's car
on the day of the incident,</b>
<b>the accused was not
with you, right?</b>
<b>I didn't go anywhere.</b>
<b>I didn't go!</b>
<b>Who all are there in your family?</b>
<b>My wife, three children and my mother.</b>
<b>You are working in a reputed company
called CJ group.</b>
<b>So, you must be earning
a good salary, right?</b>
<b>I do have a good salary.</b>
<b>You are paid well because the work
is quite demanding, right?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Amidst your busy work schedule,</b>
<b>do you get time to
call your family,</b>
<b>and to attend to household chores?</b>
<b>Not very often.</b>
<b>But when I do,
I call them.</b>
<b>When your family members call you,</b>
<b>do you always answer their calls?</b>
<b>Not always.</b>
<b>I answer when I can
or call them back later.</b>
<b>Due to your busy work schedule,
you often forget to call them back, right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>So, you are a very forgetful person.</b>
<b>Err...</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>It's common for such forgetful people,
to often misplace their stuff, right?</b>
<b>Yes, that could happen.</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>You often forget
to take your phone, right?</b>
<b>May be recorded as question and answer.</b>
<b>Answer me!</b>
<b>It's usual for you to forget your phone,</b>
<b>very often, right?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Yes! I forgot my phone
in the car on that day!</b>
<b>That's all, Your Honour!</b>
<b>Your Honour,
I would like to...</b>
<b>reserve the right to recall this witness.</b>
<b>- For what?
- Awaiting some records.</b>
<b>I can examine him further
only after verifying it.</b>
<b>I need a week's time.</b>
<b>Objection, Your Honour!</b>
<b>I am posting it for tomorrow
along with the other witnesses</b>
<b>May not be, Your Honour!
I need more time.</b>
<b>No! No! Posted for tomorrow!</b>
<b>If you want to ask anything
more, you may ask tomorrow.</b>
<b>Next!</b>
<b>Didn't I tell you?</b>
<b>He is not dependable.</b>
<b>I knew it!</b>
<b>He is their driver, after all.</b>
<b>I had other plans,</b>
<b>but the defence lawyer
manoeuvred it in a different way.</b>
<b>We must prove that
this driver drove that car.</b>
<b>That's the reason why
I asked for more time.</b>
<b>But the Judge didn't permit it.</b>
<b>Well!</b>
<b>I shall enquire once again
in my personal capacity.</b>
<b>I need to check those
visuals once more.</b>
<b>Dad!</b>
<b>From the locations where
we got our CCTV visuals,</b>
<b>could they acquire additional
visuals from other angles?</b>
<b>No chance!</b>
<b>We have already checked
all the possibilities.</b>
<b>Even if those visuals are available,</b>
<b>it's been almost seven months
since the incident, right?</b>
<b>Ahaana! I want you
to check something.</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>I shall go in the morning itself.</b>
<b>Alright!</b>
<b>- Ahaana hasn't come?
- No.</b>
<b>He is in Dubai.</b>
<b>I can't do anything
without asking him.</b>
<b>Can you give me your
son's number, Aunty?</b>
<b>I'll call him and ask.
It's an emergency.</b>
<b>- What's your name?
- James.</b>
<b>James!</b>
<b>How do you know Michael?</b>
<b>We are friends.</b>
<b>We are friends!</b>
<b>On the 27th,</b>
<b>at a resort called Misty Hills,</b>
<b>a few of you friends
gathered together.</b>
<b>- Isn't that right?
- Yes.</b>
<b>Can you tell me the names of the people
who were present for that get-together?</b>
<b>Apart from me, Nishanth,</b>
<b>Jayachandran,</b>
<b>Jayachandran's wife Nikhila,</b>
<b>and... Michael.</b>
<b>Mr. Prosecutor,</b>
<b>cross?</b>
<b>No questions for the time being.</b>
<b>I would like to reserve my
right to recall this witness.</b>
<b>Objection!</b>
<b>Witnesses cannot be recalled on
the same day, as it...</b>
<b>I believe it's important...</b>
<b>to ensure the accuracy
of their testimonies.</b>
<b>Yes, yes.
You may call your next witness.</b>
<b>Nishanth,</b>
<b>at what time did you reach the resort?</b>
<b>Check-in was around 2:00 p.m.</b>
<b>After that, around 2:30 p.m.,
James and I reached there.</b>
<b>10 minutes later, Jayachandran
and Nikhila arrived.</b>
<b>That's all.</b>
<b>Cross?</b>
<b>Reserve my right to recall.</b>
<b>How long has it been since
you got married, Jayachandran?</b>
<b>It's been nine months.</b>
<b>When you arrived at the resort,
was Michael present there?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>When did Michael come?</b>
<b>One hour after we reached there.</b>
<b>That means, at 3:30 p.m.</b>
<b>- Right?
- Yes.</b>
<b>That's all.</b>
<b>Cross?</b>
<b>No cross.
Reserve my right to recall.</b>
<b>What is your father's name, Nikhila?</b>
<b>MK Ramachandran.</b>
<b>What does he do?</b>
<b>He's the Director General of Police.</b>
<b>Oh! So, you're the daughter of
the Police Chief of the State, huh?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Nikhila, you had also gone for
Jayachandran's friend's party on the 27th.</b>
<b>Right?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Are you acquainted with
the accused Michael?</b>
<b>He is my husband's friend.</b>
<b>But I met him
for the first time over there.</b>
<b>On the day of the incident,</b>
<b>at what time did Michael
reach the resort?</b>
<b>At 3:30 p.m.</b>
<b>When did the party get over?</b>
<b>Must be around 2:00 a.m. in the night.</b>
<b>When did you guys disperse?</b>
<b>Next day morning,
at 11:30 a.m.</b>
<b>No further questions, Your Honour.</b>
<b>No cross, right?</b>
<b>- Yes. But I reserve my right--
- Yeah, yeah!</b>
<b>I'm writing that too.</b>
<b>What do you do?</b>
<b>I run a resort named Misty Hills.</b>
<b>The person standing
in that dock...</b>
<b>Have you seen him earlier?</b>
<b>- Yes.
- How?</b>
<b>On TV and the newspapers.</b>
<b>Not that.
Have you seen him in person?</b>
<b>I've seen him. Him and his friends
had stayed at my resort for one day.</b>
<b>When was that?</b>
<b>27.12.2022.</b>
<b>They checked out the next day.</b>
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Prosecutor, do you want
to ask anything, or again...?</b>
<b>Do you know what's the punishment
for giving a false testimony?</b>
<b>I know.</b>
<b>As per Section 193 IPC,</b>
<b>seven years in prison.</b>
<b>I'm also a lawyer.</b>
<b>Just that I'm not practising.</b>
<b>In your resort,</b>
<b>do you have CCTV cameras?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>How come you haven't installed any?</b>
<b>I felt they were unnecessary.</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>Must be because
you're well-versed in law.</b>
<b>Now, I would like to recall
Michael's friends.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>the three other witnesses
should be shifted outside the courtroom.</b>
<b>Objection, Your Honour.</b>
<b>It is essential that all witnesses should
be present to ensure transparency.</b>
<b>Your Honour, my intention is to prevent
any possibility of collusion.</b>
<b>The testimonies should
not influence each other.</b>
<b>I understood your concerns.</b>
<b>The three of you, please step out.</b>
<b>As per your statement,</b>
<b>on the 27th, at 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon,</b>
<b>Michael arrived at the resort
driving his own car.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>How can you state the time</b>
<b>and the fact that he came there
driving his own car, so precisely?</b>
<b>- Did you see him coming?
- Yes.</b>
<b>We checked in around 2:30 p.m.</b>
<b>At 3:30 p.m., we stepped out
to check out the resort premises.</b>
<b>That's when we saw
Michael arriving in his car.</b>
<b>In which car did Michael come?</b>
<b>- Huh?
- What make?</b>
<b>- Honda Civic.
- Colour?</b>
<b>- Blue.
- What dress was Michael wearing?</b>
<b>What dress was Michael wearing?</b>
<b>Objection!</b>
<b>Will anyone remember what dress
a person was wearing eight months ago?</b>
<b>- I don't remember.
- You remember everything else.</b>
<b>And if you say you don't
remember this alone,</b>
<b>- I find it difficult to believe.
- I swear, I don't remember it.</b>
<b>No. Michael never
came there on that day.</b>
<b>And you never saw Michael.
Right?</b>
<b>Err...</b>
<b>- The make of the car?
- Honda Civic.</b>
<b>- Colour?
- Blue.</b>
<b>What dress was Michael
wearing on that day?</b>
<b>Your friend James told us
that the attire was jeans and a T-shirt.</b>
<b>Don't look there.
Look at the Judge and say it.</b>
<b>He was wearing a pair
of jeans and a T-shirt.</b>
<b>What colour?</b>
<b>- Colour...?
- What pattern?</b>
<b>Full sleeve?</b>
<b>Half-sleeve?
Round neck?</b>
<b>Or with collar?</b>
<b>This is to discredit the witness.</b>
<b>Forget colour.
He's asking for the pattern also now.</b>
<b>So, you forgot to teach them
the colour and pattern, right?</b>
<b>Michael never went there on that day,</b>
<b>and they're giving false
testimonies before the court.</b>
<b>I suggest so.</b>
<b>No. He came there.</b>
<b>What dress was he wearing that day?</b>
<b>Err... Pants and shirt.</b>
<b>Your friend said that the attire
was Jeans and a T-shirt.</b>
<b>Hello! Don't look there.
Look here and say it.</b>
<b>I don't remember.</b>
<b>You remember everything else correctly.</b>
<b>How did you forget this alone?</b>
<b>Don't you remember at least the colour?</b>
<b>Pattern?</b>
<b>Full sleeve?</b>
<b>Half sleeve?</b>
<b>No answer.
May be recorded.</b>
<b>You may step down.</b>
<b>Which car did Michael come in?</b>
<b>I mean, what make?</b>
<b>You don't know?</b>
<b>It's alright. We'll consider
that you didn't notice it.</b>
<b>But you won't forget
the colour, right?</b>
<b>- That...
- You don't know that either?</b>
<b>What dress was Michael wearing
on that day?</b>
<b>What colour?</b>
<b>What pattern?
T-shirt?</b>
<b>Shirt?
Full sleeve? Half sleeve?</b>
<b>In reality, you never
saw Michael over there.</b>
<b>You haven't seen him!</b>
<b>Because Michael never came there.</b>
<b>Your husband and his friends,</b>
<b>didn't have answers for my questions.</b>
<b>The court has understood the truth.</b>
<b>At least now,
please open up, sincerely.</b>
<b>You're the daughter of the highest
ranking police official of this State.</b>
<b>Objection, Your Honour.</b>
<b>He's harassing my witness.</b>
<b>Prosecutor!</b>
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>
<b>I can understand the others saying so.</b>
<b>They are Michael's friends.</b>
<b>But you are not like that.</b>
<b>You are a woman.</b>
<b>You're standing against a blind girl,
who was subjected to a heinous rape.</b>
<b>This may happen to you also tomorrow.</b>
<b>To your sister,</b>
<b>or your friend or anyone else.</b>
<b>You must show the courage to speak
out the truth, at least now.</b>
<b>I don't know anything, sir.</b>
<b>I don't have anything to say.</b>
<b>You have said it
without saying anything.</b>
<b>You may step down.</b>
<b>I'm sorry.</b>
<b>Sir, Ahaana Chechi.</b>
<b>Without interruption...</b>
<b>You are interrupting!</b>
<b>Pardon me! Filing a petition
to accept an electronic evidence...</b>
<b>with 65B Certificate.</b>
<b>Copy not served.</b>
<b>I shall.</b>
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan,</b>
<b>I will not entertain this kind
of practice in my Court.</b>
<b>The aim of every court
is to discover the truth.</b>
<b>Section 311 CrPC is one
of many such provisions...</b>
<b>which strengthen the arms of a court,</b>
<b>in its efforts to unearth the truth,</b>
<b>by procedure sanctioned by law.</b>
<b>At the same time,</b>
<b>the discretionary power
vested under Section 311 CrPC</b>
<b>has to be exercised judicially,</b>
<b>for strong and valid reasons,</b>
<b>and with caution and circumspection
to have a just decision of the case.</b>
<b>What is this new evidence?</b>
<b>What is the relevance?</b>
<b>PW7, Driver Robin.</b>
<b>I've submitted an electronic
evidence to the court,</b>
<b>to prove the contradictory statements
made by him before the court.</b>
<b>It cannot be accepted, Your Honour.</b>
<b>The source of this electronic evidence,
its custodian...</b>
<b>None of these have
appeared before the court.</b>
<b>It cannot be accepted as legal evidence.</b>
<b>Mrs. Counsel, don't you trust
your driver's testimony?</b>
<b>This is not a matter of trust.</b>
<b>In the court--</b>
<b>I haven't decided whether this
has to be marked or not. Got it?</b>
<b>What is this?
Can you explain?</b>
<b>This is video clip no. 3 of Exhibit D4,</b>
<b>adduced as evidence
by the defence.</b>
<b>From its examination,</b>
<b>it was observed that the accused's car
passed through Nalanchira Junction.</b>
<b>And these are the visuals
recorded on the dash-cam of this car</b>
<b>that came from the opposite direction,
at that junction.</b>
<b>From this visual, it is clear
that on the day of the incident,</b>
<b>the accused was
not driving the car,</b>
<b>and it was his driver, Robin.</b>
<b>How can the court ensure
the credibility of these visuals?</b>
<b>This incident happened
eight months ago.</b>
<b>What's before the court now,
is just a pen drive.</b>
<b>When we enquired
about this car's details,</b>
<b>we realized that Vijayakumar,
who works in Dubai,</b>
<b>had bought this car for his own
private use, when he comes to Kerala.</b>
<b>Since it has been eight
months after the incident,</b>
<b>we were afraid that these
visuals may have been lost.</b>
<b>But since it's a car that has made
only a limited number of trips,</b>
<b>we were able to get the visuals.</b>
<b>Are you able to produce
the original device?</b>
<b>It's being produced, Your Honour.</b>
<b>Any further evidence
from the defence side?</b>
<b>No, Your Honour.</b>
<b>So, I can close the defence
evidence, right?</b>
<b>The Prosecution has obtained
a few public documents.</b>
<b>Your Honour, this is a...</b>
<b>certified copy of Mumbai High Court's
single-bench verdict, from April 2016.</b>
<b>This is an order upon the petition that
was filed to quash an FIR and final report</b>
<b>registered as Bandra Police
Station Crime No. 492/2016.</b>
<b>The offence was rape.</b>
<b>Though an FIR was written,</b>
<b>they were unable to
arrest the accused.</b>
<b>When the court examined
the charge-sheet,</b>
<b>no evidence was found.</b>
<b>Based on the victim's affidavit,</b>
<b>the court quashed the final report.</b>
<b>Your Honour, in the documents
submitted before the Honourable Court,</b>
<b>the person mentioned
as accused in the FIR,</b>
<b>is 21-year-old Michael Joseph,</b>
<b>son of Christopher Joseph.</b>
<b>It's the same accused who's standing
in the accused dock before this court.</b>
<b>The accused in both cases
are one and the same.</b>
<b>Dad, what is this?</b>
<b>Nobody told me about this.</b>
<b>It is evident that the accused
had the history...</b>
<b>of committing the offence
of same nature.</b>
<b>All are certified copies.</b>
<b>They are public documents.</b>
<b>I can mark them, right?</b>
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>
<b>No objection in the veracity
of the documents.</b>
<b>However,</b>
<b>as long as the court hasn't found
Michael to be guilty,</b>
<b>in any of the documents
submitted by the Prosecution now,</b>
<b>we cannot say that the accused
has antecedents.</b>
<b>Mrs. Counsel has raised a valid point.</b>
<b>There is no conviction.</b>
<b>Your Honour, I was pointing out
the modus operandi of the accused.</b>
<b>Just because the accused was never punished
in the cases he was charged in so far,</b>
<b>this argument shouldn't be discarded.</b>
<b>Yes. Defence evidence is closed.</b>
<b>Posted on...</b>
<b>Shall I fix it on 21/11?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Posted on 21.11.2023 for final hearing.</b>
<b>The way you questioned his friends...</b>
<b>That was really awesome!</b>
<b>If they had recreated that day,</b>
<b>we would have
been in deep trouble.</b>
<b>So, we will win this case.
Right, sir?</b>
<b>To be frank, we cannot confirm it yet.</b>
<b>Their lies have all been exposed, right?</b>
<b>So, isn't it clear that it is him, sir?</b>
<b>Well, their main argument
was that he drove his car...</b>
<b>and went somewhere else,
on the day of the incident, right?</b>
<b>Sir, it's just that we've destroyed
the possibilities for Michael...</b>
<b>to be easily acquitted in this case.</b>
<b>It is yet to be proved in the court
beyond doubt that</b>
<b>it is indeed Michael
who committed this crime.</b>
<b>This is such a strange system, sir!</b>
<b>Even after doing so much...</b>
<b>Sir, this is not like
an ordinary rape case.</b>
<b>If we had an eye-witness as well,</b>
<b>that would have made
our case stronger.</b>
<b>Unfortunately, Sara is blind.</b>
<b>Even though she sculpted his face,</b>
<b>it became of no use, sir.</b>
<b>So, we won't win this case.</b>
<b>Right, sir?</b>
<b>As a lawyer,</b>
<b>it's not right on my part to predict
the success or failure of this case.</b>
<b>Anyway, during the final hearing,</b>
<b>I am going to make one last attempt.</b>
<b>I'll try casting a bait.</b>
<b>Depends on our luck whether
they would take the bite or not.</b>
<b>Yes, Mr. Prosecutor!</b>
<b>What do you have to say?</b>
<b>Your Honour!</b>
<b>I don't wish to resort to the approach
of a usual final hearing.</b>
<b>Instead, I'll present the story
that unravelled before this court...</b>
<b>during this trial.</b>
<b>It's a story of courage,</b>
<b>resilience,</b>
<b>and justice.</b>
<b>A young man, comes to this city,</b>
<b>searching for his friend's house,
to invite him for his wedding.</b>
<b>To inquire the route
to that friend's place,</b>
<b>he enters the premises of a house.</b>
<b>There, he sees a blind girl.</b>
<b>He is drawn with desire
to that beautiful girl.</b>
<b>Upon hearing the information
that the girl will be alone at her house</b>
<b>on the next day,</b>
<b>he immediately decides to stay back
at his friend's place on that day.</b>
<b>The same night,</b>
<b>he calls up his company driver,</b>
<b>and asks him to reach there
by 6:00 a.m. next morning,</b>
<b>with another car.</b>
<b>Once his friend and his family
left to the church in the morning,</b>
<b>he asks the driver to come inside.</b>
<b>After that, he hands over his phone
and car to the driver,</b>
<b>and instructs him to go
to a resort in Kanthalloor.</b>
<b>Until that girl's father, mother
and their domestic help...</b>
<b>went out of the house,</b>
<b>he waited near their house.</b>
<b>After confirming that
everyone else had left,</b>
<b>he enters through the backside
of the house,</b>
<b>and climbs on to the terrace.</b>
<b>He enters the house through
the terrace door that was lying open,</b>
<b>and then walks into that girl's room.</b>
<b>That young man, who had
been hiding in that room,</b>
<b>assaults the girl who had just come out
after finishing her bath,</b>
<b>threatens to kill her,</b>
<b>and rapes her.</b>
<b>If you make noise,
I'll slit your throat.</b>
<b>That helpless girl who was unable to even
decipher what was happening to her,</b>
<b>regains her composure
and presence of mind,</b>
<b>uses her skill to comprehend anything
and everything through touch,</b>
<b>and identifies that young man.</b>
<b>That blind girl shows that young man's
face that was imprinted in her mind,</b>
<b>to the world, through a sculpture.</b>
<b>The young man is arrested by the police,
using that evidence.</b>
<b>The young man in this story....</b>
<b>is the one standing in the dock
of the Honourable Court,</b>
<b>Michael!</b>
<b>Up next are the evidences.</b>
<b>The chemical substance of the condom....</b>
<b>that was found from Michael's wallet;</b>
<b>The witness testimonies proving
the presence of Michael at the spot,</b>
<b>on the day of the incident
and the previous day;</b>
<b>And evidence to prove</b>
<b>that Michael was involved
in similar crimes, earlier as well.</b>
<b>The girl who showcased the accused's face
through a sculpture,</b>
<b>recognized the accused
through his voice and by touch,</b>
<b>during the identification parade.</b>
<b>The undeniable truth is that...</b>
<b>the accused's efforts to escape
the grasp of the law</b>
<b>by leveraging the benefit of doubt,
have proven to be in vain.</b>
<b>So, it's a clear case of conviction,</b>
<b>proved beyond reasonable doubt.</b>
<b>If the accused is not punished,</b>
<b>it would be akin to insulting this
blind girl who overcame her limitations...</b>
<b>by transforming her hands
into her eyes;</b>
<b>the courage she showed to expose the
accused to the world through a sculpture;</b>
<b>and her survival.</b>
<b>Hence, this Honourable Court
may kindly give,</b>
<b>maximum punishment...</b>
<b>envisaged in the Indian Penal Code,</b>
<b>to this accused.</b>
<b>The story is really nice!</b>
<b>The visuals are even more outstanding.</b>
<b>If it's a movie,
it will work wonders.</b>
<b>But, this is a court, right?</b>
<b>Here, it's the evidence that matters.</b>
<b>Your Honour!</b>
<b>Verdict of guilt must be based
on the evidence...</b>
<b>that leaves no room
for the reasonable doubt.</b>
<b>In this case,</b>
<b>plea of alibi may have
been challenged.</b>
<b>Is it beyond doubt?</b>
<b>Then, as the Prosecutor said,</b>
<b>the case is not being conducted
to just use the benefit of doubt,</b>
<b>but to declare him as innocent.</b>
<b>Your Honour,</b>
<b>there are absolutely no materials
produced before this Honourable Court,</b>
<b>that connect this accused
with the present crime.</b>
<b>There are no medical and scientific
evidence against the accused.</b>
<b>The tower locations of the accused,</b>
<b>and the witness testimonies</b>
<b>are all proving that the accused
was not present at the crime spot,</b>
<b>on the day of the incident,</b>
<b>at the time when the incident
reportedly occurred.</b>
<b>And one eye-witness who can state
that this incident actually occurred...</b>
<b>That is also absent here.</b>
<b>The victim is blind.</b>
<b>Let the Lord have mercy on the victim!</b>
<b>Your Honour, the court
cannot convict a person,</b>
<b>based on assumptions
and presumptions.</b>
<b>It should be based
on concrete evidence,</b>
<b>and that evidence
is also lacking here.</b>
<b>Just because a blind girl said
that someone assaulted her,</b>
<b>an FIR was registered,</b>
<b>and the very next day,
a random sculpture was produced,</b>
<b>to arrest this young man
and have him on this dock now.</b>
<b>It's evident that PW 2 Mohammed,
the victim's step-father,</b>
<b>is a skilled sculpture artist,</b>
<b>from his own testimony.</b>
<b>We must consider
the possibilities that...</b>
<b>Mohammed could have created
the sculpture on his own...</b>
<b>and presented it to the Police.</b>
<b>Furthermore,</b>
<b>there are no evidences
adduced till date,</b>
<b>which can prove
that this blind victim....</b>
<b>is a sculpture artist.</b>
<b>She is a skilled sculpture artist.</b>
<b>As my learned colleague pointed out,</b>
<b>if this victim claims
to be a skilled dancer,</b>
<b>would you all believe
it without any proof?</b>
<b>No! You can see it for yourself
whether it's true or not.</b>
<b>Prosecutor, what do you mean?</b>
<b>The Honourable Court may kindly...</b>
<b>give a fair chance
to demonstrate her skill.</b>
<b>It's simply an effort to waste
the court's time.</b>
<b>Even if she makes
a sculpture or not,</b>
<b>that cannot be adduced as
evidence before this Court.</b>
<b>Why? What happened?</b>
<b>Mrs. Poornima, are you doubtful now,</b>
<b>that she could be a
skilled sculpture artist?</b>
<b>That's not the case, Your Honour!</b>
<b>After the trial has been completed,
and as the final hearing nears its end,</b>
<b>he has come up with a procedure
called demonstration, which is unheard of.</b>
<b>From time to time,
to substantiate the truth,</b>
<b>many of the decisions taken
by the courts in this country,</b>
<b>have become part of history.</b>
<b>To grant justice to a helpless girl,</b>
<b>who has been a victim of a brutal rape;</b>
<b>what's wrong if this Honourable Court
decides to create history?</b>
<b>Your Honour may lay down the law!</b>
<b>May be it is unprecedented.</b>
<b>But I feel it is essential.</b>
<b>But, before that, we need to know
if the victim is ready for it.</b>
<b>Extraordinary moments are
unfolding before the Court now.</b>
<b>As the final hearing was coming to a close
after the completion of the trial,</b>
<b>the Prosecution has made
an unexpected move.</b>
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan, how do you propose
to demonstrate it?</b>
<b>We will select a person
who is presently in this courtroom.</b>
<b>Then, that girl will touch
that person's face to assess it,</b>
<b>and make a sculpture of that face.</b>
<b>A humble submission, Your Honour!</b>
<b>- Yes!
- Please allow us to select that person.</b>
<b>I think it's fair.</b>
<b>Yes! You can choose.</b>
<b>This should be conducted
in an atmosphere</b>
<b>similar to the one where the
crime reportedly happened.</b>
<b>I mean, she should be alone.</b>
<b>Also, to touch and assess the person,
a time frame should be fixed.</b>
<b>Like, five minutes?</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>In the incident that
stunned the State,</b>
<b>there emerged reports that the sculpture
found by the investigating officers</b>
<b>was actually created by the victim.</b>
<b>This sculpture led the police to deduce
that Michael is the main suspect.</b>
<b>But at this moment,
as the trial is almost complete,</b>
<b>why has the court asked
the girl to make a sculpture?</b>
<b>That's the question
which has emerged now.</b>
<b>The court premises
have become the stage...</b>
<b>for exceptionally dramatic
moments, at present.</b>
<b>Can I?</b>
<b>Yeah!</b>
<b>Could you please stop moving?</b>
<b>Of course!</b>
<b>I shall do everything as you say, Sara.</b>
<b>After all,</b>
<b>it is to save my client, right?</b>
<b>I shall stay put.</b>
<b>Touch me!</b>
<b>Touch me wherever you want to!</b>
<b>Sara!</b>
<b>Just like your other sensory organs....</b>
<b>is this also really sharp?</b>
<b>I mean, your sense of touch?</b>
<b>Tell me, Sara!</b>
<b>Sir! Please let me do this now.</b>
<b>Please let me focus!</b>
<b>Well!</b>
<b>Fathered by some random man,</b>
<b>and addressing someone else
as your father,</b>
<b>you've been leading a
terrible life as a blind girl,</b>
<b>and some random guy
raped you as well.</b>
<b>What's the point in having
all these talents?</b>
<b>Can anyone change your fate?</b>
<b>It's a cursed life, isn't it?</b>
<b>Sara, do you remember that day?</b>
<b>Running your fingers
through his face, just like this?</b>
<b>Try to recollect it.</b>
<b>How was it?</b>
<b>Did you enjoy?</b>
<b>Was it your first time?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>I don't think so.</b>
<b>It wasn't your first time, Sara!</b>
<b>Right?</b>
<b>This is quite strange and unbelievable!</b>
<b>When you were being raped,</b>
<b>you were so composed,</b>
<b>so as to run your fingers
through his face,</b>
<b>and identifying him thereby.</b>
<b>This is not a rape.</b>
<b>This is... consensual!</b>
<b>You wished for it,</b>
<b>and it has happened
with your consent.</b>
<b>Isn't it, Sara?</b>
<b>Please show some decency, sir.</b>
<b>Decency?</b>
<b>While seducing a random stranger,</b>
<b>and thereby orphaning
his wife and children,</b>
<b>your mother never showed any decency.
And you expect it from me now?</b>
<b>Whatever you've done so far
is not at all surprising.</b>
<b>You were born to that promiscuous
mother of yours, right?</b>
<b>Sorry! Time is up!</b>
<b>âª Did memories etch within
like nails' sharp trails? âª</b>
<b>âª Have smiles been lost,
like lamps quenched in gales? âª</b>
<b>âª In shedding the past,
has your face lost its brightness? âª</b>
<b>âª For the truths uncovered in days gone,
is time the only witness? âª</b>
<b>Arun, we are witnessing
an extraordinary event.</b>
<b>A court in Kerala is continuing
its proceedings into the night.</b>
<b>I suppose everyone in the huge crowd
that you can see behind me,</b>
<b>are keenly and anxiously awaiting
the verdict of this sensational case.</b>
<b>âª O' soul, hold on,
don't lose your might âª</b>
<b>âª Stand your ground,
don't sway from sight âª</b>
<b>Arun, even on social media platforms,</b>
<b>very strong reactions
against the accused,</b>
<b>had arisen from the very
beginning of the case.</b>
<b>The latest update is that
the Court has instructed the victim</b>
<b>to create a sculpture of one of the people
present in the trial room.</b>
<b>âª In summer's heat
where doves search for shared shade âª</b>
<b>âª Have eyes lost their slumber
in night's long parade? âª</b>
<b>âª Where broken glass has pierced
the tips of your fingers so slight âª</b>
<b>âª The world will follow, hand in hand
with you, making your burden light âª</b>
<b>âª O' soul, hold on,
don't lose your might âª</b>
<b>âª Stand your ground,
don't sway from sight âª</b>
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar!</b>
<b>Please come forward.</b>
<b>Turn around.</b>
<b>The accused is found guilty
for the offence under Section 376,</b>
<b>452 and 506 of Indian Penal Code.</b>
<b>Mr. Prosecutor!</b>
<b>What do you have to say?</b>
<b>Your Honour! Rape of this nature,</b>
<b>is an atrocity on the human society,</b>
<b>and not against that given individual.</b>
<b>To deliver justice to helpless victims,</b>
<b>and to prevent the occurrence
of more such victims,</b>
<b>it is imperative that the
accused be sentenced to...</b>
<b>the maximum punishment
permitted by the Indian Penal Code.</b>
<b>Hence, I pray for a life term,
with heavy fine to this accused.</b>
<b>Yes, Madam.</b>
<b>What do you have say for defence?</b>
<b>Your Prosecutor is seeking a life term
and heavy compensation!</b>
<b>Your Honour!</b>
<b>The accused has no antecedent,</b>
<b>and his age and education
should be taken into account.</b>
<b>I kindly request this Court to please
consider a more lenient sentence.</b>
<b>The Thumba rape case, which created
a storm in the State...</b>
<b>In the case where a bling girl was raped,</b>
<b>the prime accused Michael,
has been found guilty by the court.</b>
<b>We've learned that the punishment for the
accused will be declared in the afternoon.</b>
<b>In the light of evidence,</b>
<b>and the nature of crime,</b>
<b>this court sentences
Michael to life imprisonment,</b>
<b>and a fine of â¹2 Lakhs,
under Section 376</b>
<b>of the Indian Penal Code,</b>
<b>and in default thereof, to undergo
further imprisonment for two years.</b>
<b>Victim is entitled to
compensation as per...</b>
<b>Section 357 A CrPC from the
State's victim compensation scheme.</b>
<b>The bail bond of the accused is forfeited.</b>
<b>He is sent to the prison
for undergoing sentence.</b>
<b>Mrs. Counsel...</b>
<b>Does the accused
have a preferred jail...</b>
<b>for visits from his close relatives?</b>
<b>Bench clerk,</b>
<b>check that and issue the conviction
warrant to that jail.</b>
<b>Sir! Sir! Sir!</b>
<b>- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</b>
<b>Congratulations.</b>
<b>- Congrats.
- Thank you, sir.</b>
<b>- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</b>
<b>I'm happy you're back.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>The court has found out that the culprit in
the Thumba rape case is Michael indeed.</b>
<b>The accused has been
sentenced to life imprisonment...</b>
<b>Sir! Sir! Sir!</b>
<b>Sir, just a minute!</b>
<b>Sir, as the investigating officer
of the case, what do you have to say?</b>
<b>This is the victory of truth.</b>
<b>The victory of a collective.</b>
<b>Do you think justice has
been served for the victim?</b>
<b>Definitely!</b>
<b>Sir! Sir! Sir!</b>
<b>What happened inside the court, sir?</b>
<b>- What happened, sir?
- Please! Please! Please!</b>
<b>Sir, it's a sensational case.
What did the court say?</b>
<b>- What did the court say?
- No comments!</b>
<b>Sir, what is...</b>
<b>Do you think justice has
been served for the victim?</b>
<b>There are higher courts too, right?</b>
<b>We'll go for an appeal.
That's all.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>My daughter has a wish, sir.</b>
