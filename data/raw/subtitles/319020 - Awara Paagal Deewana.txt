No... please don't shoot
I'm willing to do as you say.
I made a mistake
I'll never make this mistake again
I have three wives...
they'll all be widowed
I have 13 children and 26 dogs...
they'll all be orphaned
The moment I held the gun
to his temple...
the colour drained out
of his face!
Bloody lawyer!
"What mistake did
the lawyer make, sir?"
He walked into my bedroom to tell me
that the cops were looking for me
Without even knocking on the door.
- Is that all?
Did you treat the lawyer like a dog
for just that much?
Moron! I was in bed with his wife!
Wouldn't I get bugged?
- What then?
"You know, I'm a large-hearted man."
"Before dumping him in the sea,
I felt pity for him"
"I didn't want to torture the poor guy,
so I killed him just like that"
I dragged him by the neck and took him
to the terrace. I gave him a choice
"Will you jump on your own?
Or must I push you?"
That was it!
He started screaming
Killed me... help
Is someone there...?
Daddy has got a heart-attack
Call the ambulance. Hurry up.
- Call his son. At once!
This is treason
What did you say?
- That gun is sold to someone else
Your father and Guru Gulab Khatri made
a deal. No double-crossing the boss
What's stopping me?
- My loyalty to the boss
You must take this pill.
- Pill...?
You'll feed me a pill? You're
the one who's taking a pill if I die
I'm not going to spare you
Lawyer...
"Please, put that gun away.
Else, I'll end up just like you"
Phone...
- I have telephoned your son
He should be coming.
- Moron! Not my son
I told you to call my son-in-law.
My son is a son of a mule
My daughter's husband... he's a gem!
Where is my son-in-law?
Where is Guru?
"Your father-in-law is in hospital.
Get over, quick"
"How did this happen?
- It's over, son. I've little time"
I got to let you in on something
I've hidden from you all along
What is it?
- Last year out of the American deal...
that take was 10 billion.
In diamonds
And I...
And what did you do Daddy?
- I planted a mango tree
Drop mango. What about the diamonds?
- Don't. They will rot
Diamonds... rot...?
- Ass! Not diamonds. Mangoes
Unless you pluck mangoes in time.
- I'll have every tree plucked
What about the diamonds?
- Diamond! She was my best cow
Gave 10 liters of milk a day.
Any ox would die for her
Make sure you give her a memorial.
- Don't chew my brains
Reminds me of a great dish
your mother used to cook
"I could've chewed up her fingers,
that was when she fed me herself"
Diamonds! Worth 10 billion!
Where are they stashed?
Diamonds! Son! In the American bank.
Seventy five quid...
Diamonds worth seventy five quid...?
- I owe the laundry 75 quid
Make sure you get my loincloth.
- If you drop dead...
I'll spend the rest of my life in
a loincloth. Where are the diamonds?
Die... die...
- Diamonds... where...?
Dye my hair before my funeral.
I want to die young
Diamonds! Where are they?
I am reading out
the testament...
that Baba Baldev Prasad
wrote...
before his death.
It goes to say...
that he has bequeathed
his entire estate...
"in three equal parts,
to be distributed amongst..."
"his son Vikrant, his adopted daughter
Preeti and his son-in-law, Guru Gulab"
Diamonds worth 10 billion
lies deposited...
"in New York Bank,
New York City, in America"
The bank will release
the diamonds...
"only on personal signatures executed
by the three of you, in person"
"Should any of the three die,
two will sign"
And the death certificate of
the deceased is to be produced
"Should two of the three die,
2 death certificates may be produced"
"The third will sign. Should all die,
the diamonds will pass to Champaklal"
Who's this Champaklal?
I'm going to kill him right away
How can you? I am Champaklal.
Your advocate
Oh you are the one? Bloody lawyer!
This must be one of your ploys
What are you doing? At least hear out
one final point in the will
What final point?
- Should I be the first one to die...
no one gets anything. All the diamonds
go to a cattle-rearing trust
"No one gets anything, if I die.
Please think about it"
Let me know when I got to go
to America to retrieve the diamonds
I'll be there
I'll send you...
to the land of no-return
Guru... Preeti speaking.
- Yes go on
Our marriage was a compromise
we went through quietly...
for the sake of Daddy's happiness.
Ever since the wedding...
we have never been together.
What husband-and-wife? We're strangers
"Now that Daddy is no more,
I want to put an end to this farce"
We ought to separate.
- I know why you want a divorce
A share in your father's diamonds
goes to his son-in-law. Which is me
"Divorced, I'm no longer your husband.
Nor your Daddy's son-in-law"
You and Vikrant will grab my diamonds.
- I'm not interested in diamonds at all
"Listen to me, Guru"
What a quandary you have left me in...
My step brother wants to grab my estate
And that Guru... he doesn't even know
that Vikrant is after his life
"Must be hiding inside!
Come on, in... quick"
Security has been tightened.
He cannot escape
Cell phone? Lighter? Loose change?
Anything on you...?
I'm asking you
Surrender
"Last night, Guru Gulab Khatri
shot the Home Minister dead"
The police has announced
a city-wide red alert
All roads leading out of the city
are sealed
"Check posts are up at railway stations,
bus stations, airports"
The whole city is being watched
by the police. The police claims...
that he will be taken dead or alive
in a matter of hours
Not hello
Get shocked
Shocked to hear Guru's voice?
You want to frame me?
You tried to kill Guru
for a handful of diamonds?
Now it's your funeral. Because
Guru knows where you are
You don't know
where I am
He escaped
"Sir, I told you before.
Crime never pays"
He isn't getting away.
I'll find him
"Someone, somewhere, sometime...
will surely give him away"
"Wayward, crazy, insane..."
your lover has become...
your eyes have ruined me
My love...
I give you my heart
You are my monsoon...
I pine for you...
to the depths of my soul
"I met you, I found out..."
I'm hopelessly in love...
your eyes have ruined me
All I got to tell you...
in your arms...
I want to stay
You mean everything to me...
I'm in love with you...
your eyes have ruined me
My love...
my heart goes out to you
Twelve already?
- Do you find a clock in me?
"No darling, it's because you don't
get up before 12. So I thought it's 12"
You know Mummy screamed at me today.
- But we slept separate last night
You never told me you're sick.
- I'm not
Why didn't you dry last night's laundry?
- By the time I finished washing...
it was 2 a.m.
I don't know when I dozed off
"You made breakfast,
you broke teeth in the clinic..."
"you dusted the house, you did
the dishes, you washed the clothes..."
and you didn't doze off? You dozed off
just in time to dry the laundry?
Why didn't you keep your take from
the clinic yesterday under my pillow?
I completely forgot...
I don't know how I dozed off... I was
tired... I wanted to give you the money
I desperately need 20 dollars today.
- 20 dollars...?
"I'm only asking for twenty.
Not 20,000"
Asking for money from ladies up
in the morning spells bad luck for men
I just got to buy a new tie
and my spell of bad luck will be over
What about the tie you took a year ago?
Did you have it for dinner?
It's too dated to even look at
"For 25 years, your father-in-law wore
that tie. And he never said a word"
"After only a year,
it's dated for you?"
Next you'll find me and my mother
dated enough to be changed?
Biswajit... there you are
"Tell me, which one will you wear?
- Will he ever stop mixing up names?"
What are you doing with all those?
- You bought a score of them yesterday
"I just want to know which one
you want me to iron, darling Biswajit"
Paramjit.
- Paramjit... who...?
"I'm Paramjit, the woman you married.
- Sona, tell your mother not to scream"
"Daddy, my name is Mona. Not Sona.
- That's the mess with these clothes"
"I even forgot her name, Parimal!
- I'm not Parimal. I'm Anmol"
What's wrong with you Chunilal?
- Manilal
Who's Manilal?
- Your name is Manilal. Manilal Patel
When did I name myself that...?
- Ever since you were a kid
That's been my name ever since
I was a kid...? And you tell me now?
"Okay, I'll remember!
I'm Methilal"
Jesus? You just said I'm Methilal...?
"Make breakfast.
Or, I'll have you for breakfast"
Not today. Yesterday's scars haven't
healed yet. Come on brother-in-law
"Brother-in-law? I'm your son-in-law.
- At home, we're slaves anyway"
What have I gotten myself into for
a green card? Dicing green vegetables
"News from India. Guru Gulab Khatri,
the infamous mafia don..."
the assassin of the late home minister
is still at large
The assassin who specialized in killing
his quarry over a cup of coffee...
has fallen out
with rival don Vikrant
Unconfirmed sources say that
Vikrant has announced a reward...
of 20 million for news
of Guru Gulab Khatri
You heard that? A 20 million reward!
- Unless we hurry with the breakfast...
those two hoods will declare
a 2-dollar reward on our heads
"Hurry up, bring up the tea.
- Oh yes"
"Daddy, American chopsuey for me.
- I won't"
Why won't you?
- I want 50 dollars
We don't charge you for eating and
you want 50 dollars to cook for us?
I need it for buying grocery. Did I
ever want to get paid for cooking?
Last week I gave you 50 dollars.
You haven't yet settled the account
I will settle. Accounting isn't
as simple as eating. Takes thinking
"If there's a mess-up,
you'll be after my life"
Just let me have 50 dollars.
I'll settle the accounts later
I must have the account tonight.
- Sure. I don't want to be kicked out
Come on Tol-Mol.
- Not Tol-Mol. Anmol
Come on son-in-law.
Don't you want to break some teeth?
Why are you so glum?
- I chased happiness...
all the way to America.
And what I get is so much misery
I'm tired of this life of servitude.
- I understand everything
"All day in the clinic, scraping dollars
that I will give to my mother-in-law"
"And yet, a life worse than a slave?
I want to run away to India..."
"given once chance.
- Been looking for mine, for 25 years"
But Satyajit has my passport.
- Who's Satyajit?
"Your mother-in-law, my wife.
All my fault..."
"were it not for my marriage,
were it not for my daughter..."
"you'd never have been miserable.
Here, keep 20 dollars"
"20 dollars...?
- You wanted it, didn't you? Keep it"
But you...?
- I'll fudge up the accounts
"For every 20 minutes I spend shopping,
I take 3 hours writing the account"
"Don't forget the pants,
get yourself first class stuff"
When do I get your appointment?
What are you doing?
How many times have I told you?
Read a book on dental surgery
But all you do is collect
photos of goons. Strange fancy
Not fancy. Passion. Obsession
"Emotion, I'm in love, sir"
It was tough setting up the clinic.
Send the patients in
I got to leave early today
Today's a bad day
My wife is a pain in my neck.
- Cut off the neck
What...?
- Get rid of your wife
Get rid...?
- Divorce her
She won't give me a divorce.
- Why not? She doesn't love you
"Won't even let you touch her,
so what's the marriage about?"
"No servants in America.
And if they are, they charge lots"
Mona has even threatened me with
half suicide if I think of divorce
"If it takes 30 pills to kill someone,
she will take 15"
And she will write a note saying that
I drove her to suicide
"It won't kill her,
but it will kill me"
You're worse than an ass that belongs
neither in India nor in America
Really... I wonder... how long...
my silly father-in-law and I...
will keep dangling from
the tail-ends of our respective wives
You don't hear?
No dumping garbage here
Strange! No dumping! You don't get it?
I'm screaming myself hoarse
Have you sold your ears?
Hey! No dumping garbage here
"I'm being polite because you're new.
Hey flower-boy, what's your name?"
What kind of name is that?
No dumping here. You don't get it?
Sorry? You think this is India?
You can get away with a sorry?
What happened?
- For an hour I'm telling this moron...
Tell him to pick up
the garbage. Else...
Else... what?
- I'm warning you...
if I lose my head...
I'll give you a thrashing
"I see...?
- First you litter, then you see...?"
If I lose my head...
- I saw him on TV
Damn where you saw him!
If I lose my head...
He's the one with a 20 million reward.
He's a big underworld don from India
"Underworld, or underwear...
so what if he's a don?"
That Guru Gulab Khatri. The assassin
who kills over a cup of coffee
He's a don...?
- Yes
Big-time.
- Don...?
So what will you do
if you lose your head?
"I was saying, no sooner than
I lose my head, I also cool down"
"You're new here, no?
Got to tell you... as a neighbour"
Dump your garbage here. Go on.
Lovely site. Where else do you dump?
"If there's ever a bad tooth, tell me.
- And I am... what's my name...?"
"In the heat of the moment,
I always forget names"
"Someone just asked me,
Manilal, where are you going?"
In that house over there...
I'm the housewife... house-husband
"Come over, anytime for tea.
- Come on, have coffee with me"
Come on.
- No... I got to do the chores
"Come... keep the chores for later.
- I got to do the laundry, the dishes"
Then you come along.
- I got chores to do too!
Run!
"Come on, somebody
have coffee with me"
Drape the windows black!
- Why are you screaming?
Use Ranjit's dress if you have to!
- I'm Paramjit. Not Ranjit
"Whoever you are,
he'll kill you"
Mona! Our neighbour is an Indian don
with a reward of 20 million on him
A 20 million reward?
Let me take a look at him
He isn't advertising the reward
and I'm not going to let you go out
Mummy! Anmol won't let me take a look!
- You broke my daughter's heart again?
I did nothing...
- Go on and tell me if he's nice
He's a goon! He's going to kill you!
Don't you understand Karanjit?
I'm Paramjit!
- Your name won't matter. A bullet will
Shut the door.
- He's dangerous
There could be a shootout!
- What do we do now?
Let's pack for Mumbai!
- I'll do the packing
"I'll buy tickets.
- Yes, right away"
Stop
No need to buy tickets.
- My word! How about flying for free?
"If the ticket-checker comes, we'll tip
him 5 dollars. Like we did in Rajkot"
No one is going anywhere
I've seen through your ploy!
How about using the ruse of a don...
"to make a getaway?
- No! He's real, dangerous, deadly Don"
And I'm a deadly witch.
- That's beyond doubt
"Golden chance! Slipped out of our hands!
- The same hands, we shall use to cook"
"Come on, quick! To the police!
- Police... why?"
"I wrote out his letter, for the police.
Read. Is it proper English?"
What is this?
- About the don next door
And see the signature?
I have used a pseudonym. Ajit
Who's Ajit...?
- My wife
But...
- When the goons get to know...
"who wrote this letter,
they will kill them"
And then the police will kill
the goons. Two aces in one letter
Now quick! Kickstart it.
- This is a car
Then use your fingers.
- It needs a heave. Battery down
Would you like a lift?
We'll manage
"Come on, I'll give you a lift.
- Who needs lifts? We're on ground floor"
"We'll manage.
- Oh yes, we will"
"I mean, a lift in my car.
- No... we'll manage"
Just 15 miles. He walks 7.5.
I'll walk 7.5
Where are you headed?
Not to the police
Not police. Post office.
- Yes! Post office
Look! I got to post this letter.
Take care of it
No... you keep it. You're senior.
- You're junior. You keep it
I'll post it for you.
- No! Why take the trouble?
We'll post it.
- What's this enthusiasm about?
Something exciting in the letter?
- Nothing about you
Nothing special about you.
- Make sure you never write about me
I don't like being written
or read about. Get it?
We don't even know you.
We don't even know you're from India
And he doesn't even know that
you're carrying a 20 million reward
You got any idea about that?
No you don't. There...
Come on
I don't like being subject of gossip.
Pisses me off
I bit the doctor who delivered me.
- Bit him? Why?
"He was screaming,
congratulations, you have a boy"
As if it remained to be said.
So I bit him and he died
I don't bite anymore.
- How nice! Got the rage under control?
"Age mellows, you know.
- Now my parrot bites"
Parrot?
- You got a parrot? We never saw
I'll show you.
- Parrot in the pocket! Doesn't bite?
That's no parrot!
Someone fooled you!
That's a knife!
The kind you dice vegetables with
This is my talking parrot. It has
only to use it's beak on someone...
"to make you talk like a parrot.
- No, not me"
You look the innocent types.
So I'll give you 3 lifelines
"Let's get this clear. Three mine
and three his... total of six, no?"
Get that? Total of three.
One and a half for each of us
"My smile's nice too.
- Come on, let's have coffee"
No! I'm fasting!
- I'm fasting too
Let's have a coffee
We're caught between
a stone and a hard place
Welcome home.
Back home?
"Are we in the wrong house?
- No, you've come to the right place"
"Mona, fetch cold water for Daddy.
- No! I use hot wash for the dishes"
"Not for the dishes, for a drink.
How about a yoghurt shake?"
A picture of fidelity?
- You mean loyalty?
"Have dinner. You must be hungry?
- Famished! But first I cook, no?"
"If you let go of me, I'll cook.
- Dinner is ready"
What's this?
Darling! Have you married again?
You never even invited me...?
Now stop standing and staring
and come on and eat
There's the sweet you love.
- My sweet?
Don't you eat it!
They must be up to something
"Darling, you dream of going
to India, don't you?"
Who's this darling?
How dare he steal my dream?
I'm talking about you.
Here are your passports
Ours...?
- Yes
And air tickets
Glory be to the Goddess!
Bitch! Harlot!
- What are you saying?
That's what I thought you were.
For no reason
No one has ever given a divorce
so lovingly
"Once I'm rid of the cancer that's you,
when I walk a free man in India..."
"it's you I'm going to dream about.
Come on, let's go"
Stop
I'm not divorcing you. I'm only
sending you to India for 10 or 12 days
She's only letting us out on bail!
- Yes. And you'll return from India...
with that 20 million.
- You want a dowry? At this age?
Look at this
"That's the address here. I know,
I'll make sure..."
I never turn up here again
- Look behind
Where...?
Obverse.
- So say that
That's Guru Gulab Khatri
"Yes, you will tell Vikrant in India
that he is our neighbour"
No! I'm not doing that!
- You must
No! I'm not going to India!
- Then I'll send this photo to Vikrant
And I'll tell him that
you are hiding Guru Gulab
I don't want Guru Gulab to kill me.
- Then you got to India
No! I'm not going to India!
- Then get ready to die
Dusting in half an hour!
- Dishes in 15 minutes
Ten minutes for washing and ironing!
- Five minutes to cook dinner
Two minutes...
- One minute! I'm going to India
You're staying in
Room 502 in Hotel le Meridien
Get ready to leave tomorrow morning
Going to India?
Then they've set you free?
"No, I'm going on business.
- At least it's a holiday"
I hope it isn't forever.
- Don't worry doctor
"If God's sending you to India,
it must be for the better"
Listen... take care of the clinic
while I'm gone
Guru Gulab Khatri is reported
to have escaped from India
This is a photo of Guru Gulab Khatri
from the internet
A dangerous mafia don
is lurking behind...
this handsome face and that
innocently alluring smile
"It was in solitude on a wondrous day
that the beauty met a maverick..."
"and a strange throb
coursed their hearts"
I've sworn...
I'll love only you
I can't suppress my passion
Come into my arms
I'm restless
Let this distance be no more
"Ever since I met you,
Cupid's arrow has pierced my heart"
"Life has become miserable,
I'm dying for you"
"It was in solitude on a wondrous day
that the beauty met a maverick..."
"and a strange throb
coursed their hearts"
"A strange thirst
throbs in my veins"
"I'm caught in the spell
of a new restlessness"
Your love drives me crazy
"They're about to lose themselves
in love, they're crazed"
"Look at them, insane.
They are daydreaming"
"My love, stop me"
"I want to steal a few moments
from you"
"In my tresses
let me hide you"
"Lost in love's fires
they drew close..."
"and nothing in the world
could stop them"
Let's take a wash before we go out
looking for the brotherhood of goons
We aren't seeing any Vikrant.
- Who else gives us the reward?
"He will give us the reward,
but he will kill Guru Gulab Khatri"
"Is that the right thing to happen?
- No, but how do we face the wives?"
I've worked it out. We'll tell them
that we never found Vikrant
"Let's live it up for a week!
No washing, no doing the dishes"
Just order room service!
First class idea
For your innocent looks
you are very clever
Bill everything to the account
Where are the lights?
No lights in the hotel?
What's that?
Mannequin...?
- But not unclothed
A mannequin dressed like a smuggler?
I'm seeing one for the first time
Gold... that looks real
What happened to him?
Arrived...?
Stammers.
- What did you say?
"Nothing. Sorry, I think
we're in the wrong room"
You're in the right room.
- Then you are in the wrong room?
"Go on, get going.
- I'm in the right room too"
Then we're in the wrong hotel?
- Hey! Right hotel. No melodrama
"Stand right there.
- Strange! Right room, right hotel...?"
Are you staying with us?
But we paid for double occupancy
"So... why don't you pay us?
Indirect income, get it?"
"We'll adjust. We booked first,
so we take the beds"
You can sleep on the floor.
Now let's transact
How about an advance?
- Shut up. Or you're done for
Do you know who I am?
- You never told us
The biggest of dons in India
call me Little Umbrella
"Umbrella! That's what he sells!
We don't need umbrellas, big or small"
"Not the rainy season,
so we don't need umbrellas"
"If I buy an umbrella,
I got to account for it, you know?"
Find someone else.
- Dimwit! I'm here to kidnap you
Look Tarpaulin...
- Little Umbrella
What's Little Umbrella?
- That's my name
So what?
- You called me Tarpaulin
Why would I call you Tarpaulin?
- Because you thought that's my name
What should be your name?
- You just called me Tarpaulin
But you just said Little Umbrella.
- I said Tarpaulin because you said so
But why should that make you
change your name? Stick to one
"It's messy, you know Parasol?"
He drew this out of that!
- I'll use it to cut yours out
"If I lose my head,
I'll kill you! Move"
Where to...?
- To Crazy Brother
See him? Crazy Brother!
- The one dancing with the sticks?
Who are these samples?
- Imported samples
"Here to see Vikrant?
- No, he's fibbing"
"But I'm lucky to have met you.
Come on, let's go"
Hey...
You don't say no to Brother.
Or I'll skin you alive
And all you'll be left with is...
- What?
What shrinks when skinned?
- Pencil
"No, the stuff you skin and you suck...
- Watermelon...?"
Shut up... the stuff
that's long on both ends...
juices out of either end...
what do you call that...?
"Sugarcane...?
- Yes, sugarcane"
I'll skin you till you're
only left with so much
"He's absent-minded, just like you.
- I only forget names"
He forgets stupid things.
He says you're absent-minded
Shut up
Looks like I got to show you monkeys
what the cage is like. Come on
What...?
- Stop gaping and move
Take care of the parrots
while I look up Vikrant
"Lovely colour, no...?"
No you don't piss in that.
It'll change the colour of the water
It's a swimming pool
Come. Vikrant wants to see you
Where did you guys see Guru?
- I can't remember
Do you guys know the punishment
for lying?
"Why would we lie, Prashantbhai...?
- Quiet"
They won't open their mouths like this.
We need to put it in their mouth.
Now what's that...?
- Milk?
Not milk.
- So?
It turns red when it's heated up.
- A rod
"Right, a rod.
The cold part, that is"
Cold part? So why heat it up at all?
The cold part will remain inside.
How will you pull the hot part out?
But how will you shove it in?
- Go and get it. Go on
"Sure, I'll get it. Red hot...
- Hey, don't bother"
We'll tell you peda-bhai (sweetmeat).
- Not Peda. Call him Yeda (crazy one)
"Actually, he came to live
in the neighborhood"
"The first time he got into a brawl..."
I understood he was
an outliner like you
"You call us "outliners?"
"- Not you..."
"I'm talking about him, battery.
- Call me Umbrella!"
"This guy's going to run out
the batteries in my mind"!"
"Crazy, what proof that these monkeys
are speaking the truth?"
"Solid proof, actually.
His name is Ramu Raghavan"
"And here... on the back of his neck,
he has a tattoo of a rose"
What name?
"Try to figure out the name,
and you'll forget yours"
But he's speaking the truth.
Guru does have a tattoo
Sister...
The two of them have
seen your husband. In America
Why've you run out of steam?
- It's nothing
"Yeda, take them both to America.
- And kill Guru there?"
"Just keep 20 million rupees ready.
- No, you'll only track him down..."
and inform me.
When I come over...
you'll kill him in my presence.
The moment I receive his body...
you'll have your money.
- Once Crazy gives his word...
you could say he's lost his... what?
- Finger
Not finger. It's...?
- Hair?
"Not hair. Name the word,
or I'll slit your throat"
"The throat!
- Yes, throat"
"Once I give my word,
be sure Guru has a slit throat"
Throats will be slit all the time.
But how are we spending our lives?
"What happens of the reward
we ought to get, Sankrant?"
Laugh
Come on
"Daddy, listen to me...
Listen!"
I don't think we're
getting a penny from them!
Didn't you see how
they laughed at us?
Let's pack our bags and take
the first flight back to America
"No way. If we return empty-handed,
our wives will kill us"
We'd rather die at our wives' hands
than die here
Oh yes. The two of them
will at least be hanged
"Pigeons, what've you been whispering?
- We were only waiting for you"
"The name is Umbrella, what?"
"Call me the wrong name, and I'll
drive this knife into your head!"
"Smart-ass, go to the room and...
- Chain? You find those in trains"
Take a blanket and go to sleep!
- That's how we sleep. Come
Where are you going?
You go there... and you go here
To the bathroom? There are mosquitoes
there. How will I sleep in there?
"Stop raising questions,
bloody mosquito repellent!"
"Till we fly for America,
you're staying with me"
So he doesn't fly away. Get that?
Skip the drama. Move!
- Let's go
"Every night, do you...?"
Not in the nude. I sleep
with my clothes on
Not nude! Do you bathe?
- Twice
"But I bathe in the nude, Vinodbhai."
I've got so much to do! I've got
to bump off Khatri in America!
Don't drive me out of my mind!
Guruji? Bhaiji? Gulabji...
- Go on
"Guru, there's life to your danger"
"Go someplace far away,
so no one gets to know"
"Whether someone gets to know or not,
I know everything"
You're at the le Meridien hotel
in Mumbai right now. In room 502
How did you get to know?
I know about everything
you're doing in Mumbai
But just remember.
Your second lifeline has run out too
What tension he gave me!
What am I going to do?
"Give me an idea, God...
Let the bell ring!"
God...?
You...? Here?
Now don't misunderstand me...
I didn't want your husband caught
The way the gangsters behave...
I just don't like it
I had to come here because of Mona
- Mona?
My wife. Unfortunately!
"She loves money, not me. She wants
the 100 million reward. Not me"
"I'm just a dentist. You can ask my
father-in-law, if you don't believe me"
I hate bloodshed...
I'm telling you the truth
I want to go far away
from this bloodshed too
I have something to say to you.
It's this inheritance that has
bound us all together
Father distributed the diamonds
worth 10 billion in such a manner...
that it turned Guru and Vikrant
into bitter enemies
I begin to understand
I want you to make my husband
see reason
"Neither do I want him killed,
nor am I on Vikrant's side"
I'm even willing to give him
my share of the diamonds
I only want him to
give me back my life
What does that mean?
- I want a divorce
You want a divorce too?
So do I
It's five months since
we were married...
and we haven't spent a moment together
in these five months
"He never ever loved me,
nor did I love him"
He was only waiting
for daddy to die...
so he could swallow his wealth
You're so innocent
and beautiful
Nobody ever said that to me
Open the door! Hurry
- Chhota Chattri!
Open the door!
- What am I going to do?
"Open the door, I say!
- In the bathroom..."
"No, under the bed!
- Are you dead already?"
There's no room here.
- Behind the curtains. Quick!
I'll break down this door!
Tomcat! Is that how you sleep?
- What are you doing here?
I've been knocking on the door.
And they wouldn't let me get in
Where were you? Where...?
- In the bathroom
But the bathroom's on that side.
- I can even see it in the mirror
Mirror? You look in the mirror
when you pee?
Don't drive me crazy!
And pack your bags
"We're taking the flight, no?
Get on with the packing"
Or I'll open you up and
you'll forget the bathroom
Where's this scent coming from?
I don't get any scent
I can smell a perfume!
A ladies' perfume
Was a woman here?
- I used the perfume
You...?
- Yes
Here... smell this.
- Lay off!
"Don't get close, buster"
Whose is this?
Mine. I wear it in bed every night.
This is what I was looking for
In the bathroom.
- Really?
"Don't you want to wear anklets too?
- What a thing to say. Come, sit..."
Lay off! You appear
a doubtful case to me
Now pack your stuff. Move!
In a moment
How will I tell you?
- What?
"Till yesterday, I had
no purpose for being in India"
No cause.
- What does that mean?
"I mean, after spending
some moments with you..."
I have not only found a
purpose for being here...
but also a reason to live.
- What nonsense are you talking?
"Whatever happens, I'll even lay down
my life to return your happiness to you"
I'm not leaving you now.
- Shut up!
I'll cherish your memories
in my heart
What for?
- Till you belong to me...
I can have no peace.
- Step on the brakes!
Your end is here!
Faggot!
"Watch your tongue, or I'll
shove this knife into your..."
You're still stuck on that?
- And kill you!
Always end your line
Are you guys father-in-law
and son-in-law?
"You have doubts, Damodar?
- Watch it, rat!"
You take me for a gay?
They call me Chhota Chattri
"The two of you are suspicious guys!
Father-in-law and son-in-law, eh?"
I understand everything!
Pack the aircraft. We've got to
travel in the stuff
We're flying!
Here we are. In Singapore.
- Singapore?
"We were going to America, weren't we?
What have you been up to?"
"This is America, all right.
- Just clearing my doubts, you see"
This is the first time
I've ventured outside Mumbai
Not Mumbai. Say outside the country.
That's just what I thought.
We're outside something!
Anna...
I've made a grave mistake.
- What mistake?
I know. Mistake.
What mistake?
I called Guru Gulab Khatri
from Mumbai...
and told him that I've revealed
his whereabouts to Vikrant
What...? Have you gone mad?
- Let him go!
He's not mad. You're mad!
- You call Anna mad?
"I was very scared, so I told
Guru Gulab Khatri the whole truth"
Nice thing too.
He's going to finish you now
"Vipul, you've ruined everything!
- You're going to die first..."
"and then, you.
- Me too?"
"I have a wife and a daughter!
Find a way, Teda-bhai..."
Not Teda-bhai.
My boss's name is...
Tell me tomorrow.
I'm in a hurry today
"Find a way, please"
I suggest we go and hide under
the bed at home. What say?
Guru Gulab will get there
before you can do that
There's just one way
of saving your lives
We won't go to your place.
We'll go elsewhere
Where?
Isn't Anna coming with us?
- He's gone to fetch something
So he's coming here on a horse?
Why did you have to play
the honest man?
D'you know what a dangerous man
Guru is?
It's so dark in here...
Where have you brought us?
"We're not at the movies, are we?"
"I'll switch on the light.
Where's the switch, Chattri?"
"As if I come here every other day!
- Look for the switch, guys..."
"Gotcha! It's made of rubber, is it?
- Moron! It's my nose"
The father-in-law
son-in-law duo
You're back after giving Vikrant
a contract to kill me?
"Please understand, my brother...
we have made a mistake!"
"Forgive us, Guru. We went astray.
- Our wives forced us into it"
I don't have the time today.
But when I tell you my sad story...
you'll have tears in your eyes
Run!
The devil and the deep blue seas!
"Anna, watch the gun"
Don't shoot
"Scared you, didn't we?"
Look at their faces!
- You guys are friends?
They turn out to be buddies
Vikrant offered me 20 million
to finish Guru
And Guru has offered me 50 million
to finish Vikrant
"So, we're getting together to
wait for him. Let Vikrant arrive"
Brilliant!
"Call for you, sir"
Why're you yelling?
I can hear you
Yeda Anna here.
- Speak
What the jokers said
turned out to be true
Guru really lives
in their neighborhood
Catch that and come over.
- Catch what and come over?
That...
How will I know if you
make signs over the phone?
"One moment, sir"
What's that thing called
which flies in the air?
"One moment, sir.
- Crow"
Not crow. It flies in the air.
We fly it
Kite?
- Not kite...
it's what we sit in and fly
Catch a plane and come over
- Did you think I'd walk to America?
Hang up now. I'll come
and explain the plan to you
"All right, sir"
Didn't I tell you? Someone or the
other would surely lead us to Guru
He's in America.
- In America. What's he doing there?
He must be dancing and singing
as usual
"O beloved...
where are you?"
"O beloved...
where are you?"
"She steals my heart,
takes me for her own..."
"my beloved has left
with my heart"
You suddenly appear before me...
and set my heart racing
You look at me;
You look away
"You smile...
God Almighty!"
You are a golden beauty
"You are intoxicating
all the way, my love"
"The spell you cast,
the magic you wield..."
"has this crazy man
bowled over by you"
Your eyes...
they steal my heart
Vikrant is bound to come
He's going to be ferreted out
to be killed like a rat
"May I say something, Gurubhai?
- What just something?"
Say a lot of things.
Talk as much as you wish to
"Actually, I met your wife in Mumbai.
She's very sweet"
"I mean, she's very sweet-natured"
She has sent a message for you
What message?
She had no hand in whatever
Vikrant did to you in Mumbai
According to your father-in-law's
and Preeti's father's will...
the diamonds worth 2 billion...
"which you, Vikrant and Preeti
are going to inherit..."
she has absolutely no interest in it
All she wants from you
is a divorce
"She told me that if
you gave her a divorce..."
she'd give you her share
of the diamonds...
"Don't take up for my wife, okay?"
"Neither am I giving her a divorce,
nor am I leaving her"
And don't you dare meddle
in my personal matters.
Or I'll bury you right here.
- Forget it
Let's go to your house and
discuss important matters
"No, you guys can't stay at my place.
- Why not?"
Vikrant is not to be trusted.
He must've set dogs on your trail
He'll get to know that
we're into this together
So where are we going to stay?
On the pavements in America?
Go and stay at their place.
- My house. Get that?
Where do you guys stay?
- Bang opposite Shani's house
Not Shani. It's Guru.
And where does Guru stay?
He stays in front of our house
So where do you guys live?
We live in opposite houses. Why?
I'll straighten him out.
- Sit down. He's mad anyway
"We don't know the cops here.
Else, I'd have give it to him"
I'm back in hell!
"It's amazing, isn't it?"
You finish it before I do?
I said it's fantastic!
"You'll discover it for what it is,
only when you step in"
What?
- That's a brawl in Gujarati
Don't you have any servants
to carry our luggage?
"We're here, aren't we?
This is our duty"
I'm Coolie No. 1 and he's
Coolie No 2
"Spring to the task, son-in-law.
And get ready to play the game"
Here come our millionaires!
- Hurry up...
and grab the money from them!
Come on in. Come...
The most horrifying place on earth.
Our house
And over there is our room
"That kitchen?
- Yes, that's where we always are"
And that's the bathroom.
With running hot and cold water
"Go ahead and do your laundry,
if you have any"
Wait there!
What's happening here?
What beggars have you brought home?
"Don't worry, this is a daily affair.
She doesn't know, you see"
They're my friends.
They've just arrived from India
Now what is your name...?
- Chhota Chattri and Yeda Anna
They'll stay with us for some days.
- Why will they?
"This is no lodge, is it?
It's enough that we let you live here"
"Go on now. Get out
- Listen to me, darling..."
Have I ever listened to you?
No.
- So why must I now?
Right.
- Get going then...
pick up your bags and get lost
Will you leave or must
I throw you out?
Don't you spit here!
He's not spitting.
The poor guy has a stammer
And this dumb guy
talks in sign-language
So why must you bring the
deaf and the dumb to this place?
Go and admit them to a hospital!
Get going!
Right now! Get out...
You've been shooting your mouth off!
"Will you carry on,
only because I'm quiet?"
Out of my way!
Let the breeze through
You shut up!
Don't you dare yell
at Chhota Chattri
How dare you talk like this
with my mummy?
"Madam, enough of your chatter.
Or else, that thing in your head..."
what is it called?
- Brains
Women don't have brains
in any case
What's that thing in the head
the Lord once tamed...?
Arrogance?
- Arrogance
I'll rid you of it in a second.
What are you staring at?
We're going to take a bath.
We want hot tea before that. Okay?
Let's go
Guru and Vikrant are playing
with diamonds worth billions
And we're going to
get just 50 million?
The promise I've made to Guru
is final
I'm not interested in those diamonds
worth billions
"Fantastic! Fantastic, Anna!"
You're a man of your word!
I get to learn so much from you today
I'd make a bonfire for what you said!
Fantastic!
I'm not interested in those
diamonds worth billions
It's just that the crazy one
is interested in them
Try some laddoos.
We made them
And tell us quickly where
the 20 million is
"Actually, Mona..."
"First eat the laddoos, okay?"
"Let me tell her, or she'll pull out
the laddoo from my mouth"
Nothing's going to happen.
Just eat it up
I didn't know you made
such excellent laddoos!
Forget the laddoos.
Let's talk about the millions
"Mummy, forget 10 million, we haven't
even got a single rupee"
What...?
We are trapped because we tipped
him off about Guru Gulab Khatri
Yeda Anna's going to get
the entire reward
What? The two of them are
going to get the reward?
The two of them are going
to get the money
We're happy to have the laddoos
Don't you touch the laddoos!
Keep it back in the plate
And go and prepare breakfast
for the guests. Go into the kitchen
I told you to tell them
after we had eaten the laddoos
But you had to tell him first.
- We spent so much...
"to send them to India,
and they achieve nothing!"
"Baby, we have guests at home.
You will look after them won't you?"
As if you need to ask
"What happened, doctor?"
So what's all this about?
"What will I tell you, Tina?
I'm going out of my mind"
Ever since underworld don
Guru Gulab Khatri has...
come to live in the neighborhood...
- What?
The underworld don! Guru Gulab Khatri
came to live in your neighborhood?
"I didn't speak in Hebrew, did I?
- And you tell me about it today?"
"Hurry!
- Listen, Tina..."
Do you take this for
a charitable home?
You see a doorbell
and start ringing it?
Who's going to pay the
electricity bills?
"No, I brought someone to meet you"
"Are you a doctor, or a pimp?
You mustn't do such things, son"
"Get that? Go on now.
Get lost, scram"
What happened?
"I'm here to meet you, buddy...
not to bump you off"
Who's this fast number?
She's my secretary and...
I know. Aged ten.
- Ten years? He doesn't look ten
"At ten, he used to play the
harmonium in a train. Right?"
He was a beggar then?
He has made all this
out of his alms!
Which train was it?
"In the harmonium,
he used to smuggle liquor"
"From Mumbai to Gujarat,
from Gujarat to Mumbai"
Serving a two-year sentence
at the Arthur Road jail...
he held the jailer's gun to his temple
on the pretext of polishing his shoes...
and escaped in two months.
Salim Talwar of Bhendi Bazar
He brandished a harmless knife at him
and sent him out of limits
She talks too much.
Meena's going to explode
"Tina, who?
- My secretary, Tina"
What is it with her?
Don of Radha Galli.
Babu Batli
"You made him run along the lake,
in broad daylight..."
with not a shred of clothing...
- Wrong. He was wearing shoes
Yes. And you soon became
the don of that area
Who are you? Where are you from?
Come on inside
You have my bio-data
printed on your mind
"You're a dangerous girl, I swear.
Here's a token of our friendship"
Isn't this the gun you shoved
into Babu Ballpen's mouth?
That's the one. Keep it
"You love guns and dons, I can see.
Don't your parents object?"
My mother died when I was still a kid.
My dad died 10 years ago
"Have you ever heard
of Chiman, the boatman?"
"You're Chiman, the boatman's daughter?
- Yes"
"Chiman, the boatman's daughter?
- Oh yes"
Come here
Chiman was your father?
- God! She's Chiman's daughter!
She comes from a family
of thieves!
He was the one who taught
me to handle an oar
He was my guru!
- My father was your guru?
So you become my Guru now!
- How about my fee?
Shut the door on your way out
"All right.
- Certainly, certainly"
He's asking us to leave.
And you want to drink? Hurry up
"So we leave the brother and
sister to their chat, okay?"
Let's go
You?
I've brought some hot milk for you
You drink some first
You drink some
Drink
What is it?
- Milk. For you
You drink some first.
- Well?
Drink some first
What are you laughing for?
You ought to have had a little.
I'd have drunk some too
Slowly... you and me...
don't you know the trick?
"Slowly, you sip it.
Gradually"
You've finished the milk.
What will I drink now?
What will I drink?
You have fed a snake
Only to make its venom sweeter
"He who seeks
tears and laughter..."
must fall in love
He who seeks to go mad...
must fall in love
"He who seeks to
gain and lose..."
must fall in love
He who bears every atrocity...
he who bears all the pain...
"must fall in love, my love"
"He who seeks
tears and laughter..."
must fall in love
He who seeks to go mad...
must fall in love
He who bears every atrocity...
he who bears all the pain...
"must fall in love, my love"
"It causes anguish,
it lends solace"
"It makes us famous.
It makes us infamous"
"In a moment of union
lie years of separation"
"There's merry-making in love;
in love, there is loneliness"
He who seeks to dream...

"He who wants to gain and lose...
ought to fall in love"
"Guru, the Black Crow is taking
a white aircraft tomorrow..."
and landing at daytime
Is the Black Crow all alone?
- Oh no. The mynah's with him
We'll fix the birds. Let them land.
- I understand
"You plan on starting a zoo, right?
- Shut up. Why must you speak?"
Just don't worry.
The two birds are going to be...
Stamped.
- They're stamped already
"We'll show them the wings,
take the pieces of glass..."
and fly away.
- Fly away where?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand anything
Don't you know?
- I don't
I always ask the wrong man
"Doctor, that's the lingo of
the mob"
The Black Crow is Vikrant;
the mynah is his sister
They're landing in America.
We make a meal out of them...
and quietly have a dinner.
Get that?
"Get what she says? There's a party.
With lunch and dinner, see?"
"Listen, party-hopper"
"Before they land here,
we'll garland the two of them"
"Sure, go ahead. You must
always welcome the guests"
But what flowers will you use?
Rose or jasmine?
This is America. You've got to
place an order in advance
Not that! I'm talking about
the wreath you offer to the dead
Get that?
- How would I know
I've never been dead.
- You'll know when you die then
All right... but how will I see it
when I die?
You can see it when I die!
- When are you going to die?
I'll die only after killing you!
- If the two of us die...
"how'll we see what wreath it is?
- Lay off, Chattri"
Skip the nonsense
You guys think I've started
an enquiry counter here?
You guys think so?
How many of you?
"Once I'm done with, I'll give
three diamonds to each of you"
Stop kicking up a racket
I only need to make sure that
Preeti and Vikrant are killed...
and produce their death certificates
in bank
"Sister, hurry up.
It's time for the flight"
Coming
"Hurry up, we're getting late"
Pick it up... Go on!
They've switched on so many lights.
And they call it America
Why are we guys here?
We're here to see the lighting
at the airport!
"You had a nice flight, I hope?
- You're not late. We've just arrived"
"The prey doesn't suspect
anything, does he?"
"No inkling at all, sir.
We're only waiting for your orders."
What is it?
"Nothing... you had no problem
during the flight, did you?"
Get in
"We'll meet at the hotel and
chalk out the further plan, Anna"
All right
Get in
"Threw you out, didn't he?"
That's what happens when you
get into someone' else's car
"Come on, let's get into our car"
Get started Guru. The Black Crow
has flown into our trap
Where are you taking them?
- Grand Hyatt
I'll have them check in there
and come over. Okay?
Come quickly. We'll talk it over
All right
I've booked a suite
on the top-floor
You needn't worry about safety...
You needn't worry
about Vikran't safety
"His security reaches the place he
wants to visit, before he gets there"
Think only about Guru
"Let's go, sis"
You're going to stay with me.
- No way!
"No matter where I go by day,
but I must go home at night"
You don't know my wife...
I can't sleep in a new place
You aren't going to sleep anyway.
You're going to keep awake...
"so I can sleep in peace.
What say, Anna?"
Right
"Stay with him, so you can keep
an eye on the clowns around him"
Right
Let him go...
what are you doing?
He has taken the entire top-floor
and says it's not going up
What's not going up?
- That thing which goes up and down
"An umbrella?
- No, not an umbrella"
It's that thing that takes
four or five guys in
No vulgar talk!
There are women around
It isn't vulgar talk.
How am I going to explain!
What do they call it...?
- The lift
He says no one is going up
"Don't worry, Yeda.
I'll deal with him"
"His thugs hang around the lift, right?"
I'll get on the wall
like a lizard one night...
get into his room and beat
the daylights out of him
I'll fix him nice and properly...
Guru...
- What is it?
"Chattri, what are you doing here?"
Was I expected to kill time there?
Didn't I tell you to
keep an eye on Vikrant?
And Vikrant was kidnapped
by Guru's men!
Who kidnapped him?
- You sent those Chinese thugs
What Chinese thugs did I send?
This guy looks Chinese to you?
Do they look Chinese to you?
So who were those guys?
- One moment. I say...
"those guys who came to kidnap him,
did they leave a business-card?"
"Shut up, Chattri"
We must first find out where those
Chinese guys have taken Vikrant
Will we have to go to China
to find him now?
"I can't even speak the language.
Can you speak it, Mangal?"
Shut up!
Vikrant has been kidnapped.
Whom are we going to bump off now?
How'll we get the death certificate?
- How'll we get...
the diamonds from the bank?
- I lose three diamonds then!
"You can't handle anything
properly, railway-line"
I've been noticing. You're no good.
- It isn't his mistake
It was the crazy Anna's plan.
A stupid plan!
"No, Mummy. It was Guru's plan.
- Guru's plan was fool-proof"
Quiet... quiet...
shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
Listen... whose call was it?
Vikrant's such a...
- Such a what?
Such a what?
- That which has little babies...
What babies? Puppies?
Cubs...?
Whatever... who has babies?
The mother has babies
Not mother. What is the
mother's husband called?
What do they call
the mother's husband?
"Uncle! Uncle!
- No, daddy..."
uncle is the mother's brother.
- The mother's brother is an uncle
One moment!
This woman is a mother.
Mona's her daughter...
what will she call
her mother's husband?
Father!
Father!
He has turned out to be
our father in wisdom
The guy we took for Vikrant
turned out to be his duplicate
The real Vikrant is coming in...
what do you call it?
Mail?
- Plane
He's coming in a plane
We mustn't waste anymore time
We must finish Guru Gulab Khatri.
Where will we find him?
There's this Indo-American
charity dinner today
He must performing there.
- Very well then. Let him perform
And we'll finish him off
right there
"All right, sir.
Just keep the money ready"
My love...
sweetheart...
Don't touch me!
My love...
sweetheart
"I'm all alone,
and it's difficult..."
with danger everywhere around
"So come to me, my love"
No one is escaping me...
my love
"I'm known for being wayward...
crazy and insane"
"Come to me, my love"
The nights will change...
so will the prattle
"Moments of love will
merge with desire"
"I'm on a high,
my heart says..."
look at me
"Come to me, my love"
"Come to me, my love"
I aim for him
"It all depends
on how he makes it"
His life is in danger...
whoever stands before my gun
"I'll take you in my arms,
play with your tresses..."
"beware, my love"
"Come to me, my love"
Put a coin first
This is a mobile phone.
What coin?
On the bridge
This wooden bridge along the sea...
What cops!
Give me the phone...
and cut the crap
What cops are these?
The guys in Mumbai are better
"Out with it, my friend...
three diamonds for me"
My boss Yeda Anna sees it first
My boss will show it to me first.
- My Guru will show me first
To hell with all that...
give me the diamonds
There seems to be fire somewhere
You?
- Vikrant?
How come...
- he's alive?
"He's not a ghost, is he?"
"You bite the dust at
my hands again, don't you?"
You thought Vikrant was dead?
Sacrificed for diamonds
worth 2 billion?
The guy who landed first
was me. The real Vikrant
I faked that kidnap drama
The one who got killed
was a fake
"According to police records,
Vikrant is dead"
His sins and his crimes
are dead with him
I'll bury all of you here
and start life afresh
Give me the diamonds
Hurry up and give me
the diamonds
The diamonds are here
The diamonds are lying in the car!
Stop there...
where is the bag?
Hurry! Step on it!
Take it back...
Get out of the car
Look for the diamonds
in the car
"The diamonds are with Vikrant.
Follow him, Anna"
God! Save me from him!
You're going to die anyway...
so give it to me!
Save me from this guy first!
You're not going away!
You can't defeat me!
No... I'm not going to spare you!
Scoundrel!
I won't spare you!
"Come on inside.
For you, we were..."
I know you were waiting for me
Who has the bag of the diamonds?
Out with it. Let's split it
Oh yes. Let's split it.
Bring out the diamonds
"Out with it, Mother.
- Sure. Bring out the diamonds"
Out with the diamonds.
- I never ever saw real stones
Out with it.
- Rotten mango!
They're diamonds... not stones!
Out with the bag
Sure. Out with it.
Why are you asking for permission?
Why're you guys asking one another
to get out the diamonds?
Where's the bag?
"Yeda, where's the bag son?
- I don't have it"
"Chattri, give me that bag"
"Mammo, give them the bag"
I don't have it.
- No?
"No. Oh yes, I remember...
I threw the bag to Mona"
"Mona darling, let's have the bag"
I don't have it.
- What?
"I mean, when those monsters
advanced towards me..."
I tossed the bag to my sidekick.
- What are you talking about?
"You gave that bag to me?
- No keeping it all for yourself, son"
Let's have that bag now.
- At least give me those 3 diamonds!
"Wait, I remember..."
"when I was saving Tina,
I gave the bag to Manilal"
So catch hold of Manilal!
What say?
"Why're you staring at me, tarpaulin?
- Chhota Chattri!"
Who's Chhota Chattri?
- My name is Chhota Chattri
"So what's with your name?
- Don't drive me mad, Manilal..."
He's Manilal! I told you!
Catch hold of him!
You're Manilal!
- But you said you're Manilal
"Manilal, come on"
The diamonds are not with me!
"So who has the diamonds,
if not you?"
"Speak up, or I'm going to
make you sing like a parrot!"
I remember! It's Popatlal!
- Now who's Popatlal?
The guy who was fighting there...
Now what's his name...?
Fevicol!
"This guy didn't give the diamonds
to Vikrant, did he?"
You've uttered every bloody name!
So who is it? Fevicol or Popatlal?
To Ranipal.
- And who's Ranipal?
Rekha's husband.
- Who's Rekha now?
My daughter.
- He gave the diamonds to Anmol
That's what I've been telling you.
- You've driven us all crazy!
"How many names will we play with?
- We have the name now, don't we?"
So let's have the diamonds.
- But where is Anmol?
"Think again, Anmol.
Guru has a terrible temper"
He could even kill you
"There's no turning back
for me, Preeti"
I promised to return
all your happiness to you
Now is the time
This is Anmol here.
- Where did you go away to?
Where are the diamonds?
"Preeti and the diamonds
are both with me, Guru"
So what are you doing there?
Come here immediately!
"No, Guru.
- No?"
The two of us have taken a decision.
- What decision?
We don't want to live
in your world anymore
What are you getting at?
"I mean, I don't want
to live with Mona"
So tell your wife that you don't
want to live with her! Why tell me?
Just bring the diamonds here!
Preeti wants to be free of
her marital obligations too
To hell with Preeti!
Just get the diamonds here!
I'll give you the diamonds.
But I have a condition
What condition?
You'll have to separate from Preeti.
- Bloody monkey!
You dare put conditions
to Gulab Khatri?
I won't give her a divorce.
Do whatever you want to!
What do you love more?
The diamonds? Or Preeti?
I love the diamonds
So sign the divorce papers and come
to the docks at 5 this evening
The two-penny dentist asks
Gulab Khatri to divorce his wife!
I was blinded by your love.
And you...?
You don't love that woman.
You haven't spent a moment with her
You haven't even touched her
Your marriage with her
was a farce
"And yet, to nurse your false ego,
you don't wish to break it"
This is certainly not
what I expected from you
"Tina, for the first time in my life,
I've thought of another human-being..."
other than myself.
And that's you
Well Yeda? You betray me?
You've been the biggest ingrate yet
and talk to me about loyalty?
You think Anna is deaf?
You will have a ball with
2 billion rupees...
and expect me to rot
with a few million?
Give it to me... Go on!
Don't stare at my face!
"Don't be afraid, Anna!
I'm on my way!"
"You can't get away with the diamonds,
Guru... I won't spare you!"
Anna! I'm coming!
Yeda... over here
Enough of your song and dance.
Throw the bag to me now. Go on
"Hurry up! Throw the bag to me.
- Give it away, Anna. He'll kill me"
"And watch your balance, please.
Chattri, take care of your boss"
"You shoulder the
responsibility now, okay?"
Why're you giving me extra inches?
At least give that to me...
what do you call it? What...?
He can't tell me!
At least give me a stool.
- Don't move
Or Yeda'll be twisted forever
"Know what, Yeda? The whole world
knows I always keep my promise"
You and I had a deal for
50 million worth of diamonds
Here you are...
diamonds worth 50 million
And here's a special offer
for Diwali
Three diamonds free
for both of you! Free!
I'll make a move now
O one who leaves...
turn back and look at me...
Anna...
- What?
Can you hold your breath for 5 minutes
while I get the stuff together?
Shut up! I'm in this soup
because of you
I'll beat you up when
I get my hands on you
"I've adjusted with you
all my life, Anna"
Can't you adjust with me for 5 minutes?
- Stand there quietly
"How about 4 minutes?
- Stand there, I said!"
I'll come back and stand here.
- Just keep standing!
Keep standing... don't move
I got into this mess
because of you. Stay there!
What are you doing?
Free my hands first!
What is the matter?
Why are you so sad?
I've been thinking...
- What?
"We're returning to India,
but I have nothing to give you"
Not even a house
I can give you nothing
except my love
"You can give me love, can't you?
And who says you have no house?"
You have such a large heart...
I'll live in it
"Mad girl... when the bills arrive,
the heart won't do"
"You'll need cash to settle them.
- Daddy, you?"
"Yes, daddy"
What are you doing in these clothes?
- Forget the clothes and take this
What is it?
- Just keep it! Don't ask
Diamonds?
But who gave you these diamonds?
- I'll tell you. His name...
I've forgotten the name again!
I've done nothing...
I did nothing!
That's how my son-in-law is...
I didn't do a thing!
Shut up...
- I haven't done anything
Shut up
It hurts
Here you are. That's Preeti's share
of the diamonds
"Your three diamonds are
in it too, you rascal"
You're such a nice guy...
- No abuses!
Don't say such things. Guru never
takes away what is someone else's due
Get that?
- Very well...
Let's go and drink coffee.
- No...
Let's have some coffee.
- Not coffee
"I'm fasting today...
- Oh, come on"
I'm fasting today!
I couldn't ever imagine Guru
would have such a big heart
"Forget about him. Just make merry,
why worry about details?"
Anmol... Preeti...
may you always be happy
"You're amazing, daddy!
- How come?"
You remembered our names!
Did I...?
This is a miracle!
"As soon as I get the diamonds,
Jayantilal's problem is solved!"
"Manilal!
- Manilal, who?"
