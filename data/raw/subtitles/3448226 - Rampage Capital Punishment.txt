DESPITE ONGOING MANHUNT ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES 
AUTHORITHIES HAVE DETECTED NO SIGN OF HIM EVER SINCE.
- 
This my dear viewers, 
is maybe a once in a lifetime opportunity 
for a few minutes 
uncensored material to see, 
I have something important to say, 
I had to kill and will even 
dying to be on TV, 
I call you the facts, 
The U,S, government 
is funded by the rich, 
It keeps the people 
on the intellectual level of children, 
It ensures that people 
are concerned with making money, 
That they are to family 
House and lawn care, 
People should think 
that they are free, 
and can do whatever they want, 
Free press, television, Hollywood movies, 
Schools, universities, religions ,,, 
They falsely suggesting that anything is possible, 
I tell you what that is:
a dictatorship of the brainwashing 
in the guise of democracy, 
You mean but that he was at home, 
I can not see anyone, 
Hello? Mr Johnson! 
Let us take the front door, 
let 
in an hour come again, 
- Do you want a cigarette? 
- Yes, 
I want you ask you something, 
Why do not you rob a bank? 
Or people? 
- Got it, 
- Here, 
There it is, Hurry up, 
In prison there must be better 
than on the road, 
That's not our thing, 
Here we are at least free, 
Free? You want to be free? 
What is this freedom? 
You can not even 
Buy a bus ticket, right? 
Bus tickets cost money, or '? 
In prison there is at least a while, 
Much warmer than on the road, or '? 
Money is all that you need, or '? 
That's right, Money is everything, 
- What should I do with money in prison? 
- You have nothing to spend in jail, 
Taxpayers 
pay for you in jail, 
You pay your food, 
your water, your heating ,,, 
In prison it's you warmer than if 
you sit on your lazy asses, 
Why do not you get 
your ass up and take what? 
Do you still a favor and 
robs someone from, will criminals, 
It pays off, 
Wait until I make my introduction, 
and then ,,, 
Wiki, which is ,,, 
Do you know what I mean? Andy? 
The page starts missing, 
The ones I have given you, 
Andy, that's exactly what I'm talking about, 
Then I take the damned, 
I just need people 
which are on the ball, 
Are we so far? 
Andy, we are so far? 
As we already spoke of it, 
I'm going from factual information 
Julian Assange's writing aloud, 
Since it is 40 pages long, 
I will focus on the key messages 
the minutes limit, 
"The whole of our conceptions 
and our knowledge of the world 
set the limits 
our rational action firmly, 
 course 
we all act also irrational, </ i> 
 Companies act irrationally, </ i> 
 irrational / advises 
can not tackle rational, </ i> 
 Our ability as rational beings 
rational to act and react, </ i> 
is our knowledge 
narrowed over the world, 
For a possible 
human rational action 
we need maximum input 
for our decision-making processes 
as individuals, 
as a society and civilization, 
 There are three types of history, I 
mean, what is not 2000 years ago, </ i> 
I mean all the knowledge, 
using the last week, 
 History form one 
is supported industrially, </ i> 
It's knowing how to concrete, 
Producing window or pumps, 
It seems dry and boring, 
but is of the utmost importance, 
It comprises the harvesting, 
Metal fabrication ,,, 
 History form two no one cares, 
but it is also not threatened, </ i> 
It is knowledge of industrial origin, 
that is no longer viable, 
These include books, 
are no longer moved, 
 Then there is the third form, </ i> 
It is intellectual knowledge, 
the most interesting, 
For it is not supported, 
 This branch history 
was never very pronounced, </ i> 
It's about 
as human institutions act, 
 To strengthen its industrial power 
and to be unpredictable, </ i> 
 have the facilities 
concealed this knowledge, </ i> 
 If someone finds something 
Secret documents about, </ i> 
or corporate strategic documents 
or Enron-mails, 
 and she wants to bring to light, </ i> 
mechanisms are set in motion, 
to suppress this knowledge, 
This branch is interesting, 
The other two we already have, 
This we have not, 
 Political theories tell us 
how the world has to be, </ i> 
and how to act or not, 
 to make things work one way or another, </ i> 
We should ask, 
what these political theories are based, 
 If we look at the facilities, 
so they all act unjustly, </ i> 
 Some much more than others, </ i> 
 The knowledge that we 
helps to greater justice, </ i> 
 is, 
the back keep the facilities, </ i> 
This shows 
that this knowledge can make a difference, 
 is why I say 
that censorship is to be rejected, although, </ i> 
but at the same time is an opportunity, 
Because it shows the fear 
before reforms knowledge, 
 If knowledge is so disclosed, </ i> 
then the resulting action 
and this action to an on reform, "
 To all units:House fire in 
Collingwood corner of West Second Avenue, </ I> 
 suspect with Motocross Suit 
was sighted, </ i> 
Report  All available units, </ i> 
Why land ranging Stars 
and white stockbroker, 
take the drug every day, 
not in jail? 
Because you as a rich 
're above the law, 
 You watch "Lincoln" and think 
the war was to free the slaves, </ i> 
 Spielberg makes you so even dumber, </ i> 
They ensure that the film 
will be shown in schools and television, 
but actually 
went there in every war for money, 
And the fools must die, 
because the elite decides, 
You're watching every day reality TV, 
to kill your time, 
And you think you knew communication, 
because you Anderson Cooper and 
others without their own opinion look at, 
Hey, man, how much money do you have? 
Buddy ,,, 
Do you remember me? Yes? 
What is wrong with your friend? 
He is dead, 
What's wrong with your friend? 
He is dead, 
What did I tell you? 
- That it is cold, 
- Yes, it is cold, 
Now your friend is dead, 
because you have done nothing, 
You'll be next, 
Oh, closed? 
No more bingo, 
I have the 27 Bingo! 
Bingo? 
Okay, No Bailout for you, 
It does not matter what you look like, 
Trademarks or drugs play no role, 
That should keep you stupid, 
Free press, television, movies, 
Schools, universities and religions 
are all opium of the people, 
as Karl Marx would say, 
I want you to wake up 
and be ye, 
 shooting in the Fir, corner Eighth, 
Suspect with helmet and mask, </ I> 
 He drives a gray Honda, 
Be careful, </ I> 
I'm the best moderator here,

I do need your help, 
Okay? 
Chip? 
Take care of the woman, She cries, 
Okay? See if she's okay, 
Everything will be fine, stay 
just quiet, I'll do it, 
- Did you call me? 
- Yes, 
- How many hostages are there? 
- Ten, fifteen, 
- Do you know where they are? 
- He led them to the basement 
He looks like a Robo Cop out, 
with two machine guns, 
I need two men, 
Searches top everything, 
Built the camp 
on the northwest side of the house, 
- Where did he come from? 
- He came up here, 
Look at this, My God ,,, 
Here are dozens of injuries, 
Send more ambulances, 
Alpha Team, lock the outputs, 
No one is allowed in or out, 
That crap!

It is good it all again, 
The Swat team assembles 
probably just outside, 
You will not come in, 
for they know ,,, 
that I had no choice, 
as all to shoot, 
There are probably 15 to 20 hostages, and 
probably only a suspect, 
There is only one way to the basement, 
This door is locked, 
and he has barricaded himself, 
Meaning, it is really just pure here, 
There is no way out, 
Yes, sir, Yes, I am, 
He barricaded himself in the basement, 
The ventilation system is too narrow, 
Since no one can enter or exit, 
I'm trying, 
To get audio and video recordings, 
I'll keep you up to date 
and await instructions, 
I need to see 
what's going on, understand? 
Chip, I have a request, 
Are you married, Chip?

I've decided your interests 
to ask about my life, 
I would like, 
that you wake up and change you, 
Before I tell you what you should do, 
I give you the facts, 
And I'm talking about facts, 
The NSA stores all calls, 
E-mails and SMS, 
People like Snowden or Assange, 
which provide valuable information, 
be prosecuted by the U,S, government, 
It is funded by the rich, 
She wants the people ignorant and 
hold the intellectual level of children, 
It keeps the people 
preoccupied with making money, 
They should be about family, 
House and lawn care, 
People should think 
that they are free, 
and can do whatever they want, 
They can not, 
Your representatives are paid 
to keep you stupid, 
In your stupid little world, 
Why is the sale of arms 
not controlled, 
although there are monthly rampages? 
Are performed annually in the United States 
11000 people shot, 
In the UK only 300 Why? 
Because Great Britain ,,, has no weapons, 
The people have no weapons, Point, 
What have I done, what happens 
that there is no gun control, 
There are not even 
the criminal history check, Why? 
Because 50 percent of the politicians 
be paid by the gun lobby, 
So, wake up, 
PREVENT GOVERNMENT 
TO HEALTHCARE REFORM 
Health insurance for at least 
95 percent of Americans an advantage, 
The entire developed world has one, 
Nearly 50 percent of Americans 
on the other hand, 
due to the brainwashing by the media, 
The Iraq war was a crime, 
Powell, Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld 
have all lied, 
Saddam had nothing to do with 
Weapons of mass destruction or al-Qaida, 
the Saudis 
have financed the Sept, 11, 
Because of the oil we do nothing against them, 
We send soldiers to countries with 
local attacks have nothing to do, 
Why not accused Obama Bush? 
Bush cost the taxpayers billions 
and committed war crimes, 
Why Obama is doing nothing? 
Because he belongs to the club, 
There were more immigrants 
reported under Obama than before, 
Why does not he closed Guantanamo, 
where prisoners without charges, evidence or 
a method for 13 years sitting? 
He was not against the rules 
defense law, 
the indefinite detention allowed 
also of Americans without trial, 
We have a constitutional crisis 
in the United States, a rogue state, 
International law is violated, 
the Magna Carta, which our sense 
impressed for justice for 800 years, 
Obama should pay for it 
and go to jail, 
Since we're talking about the jail ,,, 
The United States 5% of the world population, 
but 25% of the prisoners, 
People migrate 
for ten grams of cocaine in jail, 
Half sitting 
possession of drugs in prison, 
More than half of it is black, 
Why changes 
this absurd situation not? 
Because Washington of the prison lobby 
is paid to run it, 
 Why land ranging Stars 
and stockbrokers ,,, </ i> 
The guy is absolutely right, 
We should it 
Set as talk show host, 
Do you think the Morgans, Vanderbilts, 
Rockafellers and other assholes 
did with their alms something good? 
You overlook, 
that their money was stolen 
and they should not have to be rich, 
What I want from you, 
of the mass is the following:
I want you to change the world, 
This is not peaceful, 
and you can not do it alone, 
We need to kill the rich, 
Go on the road, 
 Take your weapons 
and divided Washington, </ i> 
 Bring all about the route:
Billionaires, bankers, CEOS, </ i> 
 liar, governors, 
Lobbyists, senators, </ I> 
 They are all the same, they hanged 
on the first tree that can be found! </ i> 
We need a purge, 
We need a Neustan, 
We are actually 
nationally seen everywhere, 
We have the highest ratings, 
Everyone has us on the screen, anywhere, 
Everyone knows us,

Where were you, Bill? 
Where did you 
hides the last year? 
Is it important chip, where I come from? 
What I have done in the past? 
Why is this important? 
Okay, 
Can I give you a few questions 
question about your background? 
Who are you, Chip? 
Maybe that's a better question, 
Who are you? 
You've read the Assange font, 
Do you understand what you read? 
- I understand his concern, 
- You've read it literally, or '? 
At some point you wanted to secure 
know the truth, right? 
Before you have you worried about your money, 
and television appearances, 
Sure you wanted 
be a real journalist, 
I'm a real journalist, 
But I also believe in law 
and order and the constitution, 
It is a control system of the rich, 
They are the law, 
they made the Constitution, 
for the protection of money and land, 
she stole, 
The rich are above the law, 
All over, 
Look at the Russian oligarchs, 
In Germany, it is the owner 
Bayer, BASF, BMW, VW, 
under Hitler 
they have all used slave labor, 
There are still 
same owners, 
The Royals in England, 
the rich Africans ,,, 
You have all 
their own people killed, 
They undergo all brainwashed, 
We crawl rich oil sheiks 
in the ass, 
Gucci and Lexus cars 
Buy and all U,S, companies, 
The daily bring to people, 
You give women no rights 
and kill gays, 
We do not care, 
because they have the money, 
our rulers 
are gangsters in pinstripe suits, 
You shit on the law, 
You have the system 
Homeland Security perfecting, 
You have given us the basic 
taken and liberties, 
You have the three branches of government 
completely taken for itself, 
You control the information networks, 
to spread their lies, 
You are part of it, chip, 
like everyone else, 
The moderators and editors 
are all bought, 
Right? 
What is the goal of this transmitter '? 
We have in the past two hours 
Taken $ 2,8 million, 
Through this mission, 
I have sold it, 
To all the damn station, 
This is terrific, 
and chip 
has signed a contract, 
So I have the rights to him, 
He will be a star, 
How does that feel, 
someone to take his own life? 
Have you ever 
hit someone in the face? 
Certainly, 
Once or twice? 
Do you have the connection 
felt in your own? 
Meat on meat, 
This sound, 
There is nothing deeper going Deres, right? 
We can still 
chat all day, 
But what makes the people? 
Going back, 
Going back to our original state, 
When we killed for our food, 
have hunted and gathered, 
We killed animals, 
to eat them, 
Now they are killed by machine, 
Is it not so? 
The human race has 
completely away, 
Have you ever 
bending over a dead man? 
Smelled the blood? 
the heat 
ausquellenden felt the blood? 
No, 
Then you feel 
what it means to be human, 
Then you know who you are, 
In the most basic sense, 
Not you? 
There is nothing truer than that, right? 
There is nothing truer than ,,, pain, 
Not only emotional pain, 
but real physical pain, 
And you think that ,,, 
killing of innocents 
a solution is? 
Yes, I mean, 
Is not the solution to America 
used around the world? 
With their drones? 
Take the drone bombs 
or sweets to the children from, Chip? 
They kill 50 children, chip, 
to meet a terrorist, 
We do not plunder the third world? 
Do not let others starve 
and die for our lifestyle? 
These are difficult circumstances, 
exclude the peaceful talk, 
We see crime and global warming, 
the lobbyists who bought Washington, 
the financial collapse, 
And we feel the end yet 
with printing money out, 
In the latest 50 years, everything is off, 
There are more and more people, but 
less and less water, food and oil, 
100 years, there is no earth, 
Words mean nothing, or '? 
I can influence this life only, 
by I suppose, 
I can only affect you, 
by I kill you, 
Would not be the appropriate solution, 
to found a party? 
Find trailers, let 
be selected, Change something, 
I will let you choose me? What for? 
You do not hear me, 
What should I let me choose? 
Let that shit, 
It's not about politics, 
Whether Democrat or Republican, 
does not matter, 
All these Democrats, Republicans 
and governors are bought, 
We can choose someone 
but it does not matter, 
the lobbyists 
have everything under control, 
There are always two sides, 
Everyone has an opinion, 
Is not that the beauty of democracy, 
that everyone can express his opinion? 
Yes, as long as these expressions of opinion 
change anything, 
Julian Assange, Hammond and Snowden 
are the prophets of today, 
They are the voices, 
the cry, 
And they are the ones 
wants to kill the State, 
There is no more democracy, 
We can not speak our minds, 
For this interview, I'm 
without trial in prison, 
Forever, After Guantanamo, 
This is no longer our voice, 
- Could not you change that? 
- No, I can not, 
This is the only way 
to change things, 
Bill, you seem like someone who ,,, 
a strong attachment to the mother, has 
if I may say so, 
What is this feeling that you 
could not be there when she died? 
You want to talk about my mother? 
My mother was a good woman, 
I was very important to her, 
You would have done anything for me, 
And I would do anything for them, 
Nothing is ever going to change anything, 
Nothing is ever going to change anything, 
Would they agree with 
what you do? 
This has nothing to do with her, 
Some things are bigger than 
larger than the family, 
This is about the human race, 
To our survival, 
Do you understand that? 
So people will die, 
People die chip, 
Life goes on, 
Is not it '? 
Life must go on, 
No matter what happens, 
Despite all the odds, 
Wow, that's ,,, 
This is strong, Bill, 
How do we proceed? 
I will be fumigated, 
I'm going to die, Right here, 
Are you so keep your word and ,,, 
all the people let go, 
or you will kill us? 
Yes, I will keep my word, Chip, 
I let the people go, 
But do not 
my little puppet, 
You stay here, 
You stay here and die with me, 
I may die here, 
but I die with one voice, 
Okay, get up every man! 
You all go very slowly to the door! 
You can not fumigate me 
I have a gas mask, 
We regulate the 
the old-Alamo-An, 
Now get out with you! 
Complete the hostages 
as quickly as possible away from here, 
It's over, 
Take the gun down! 
Are you kidding me?
