Sheriff Boone.
BOONE: They said
you were the one to call.
(GOAT BLEATING)
BOONE: What are they?
Cultists?
Satanists?
(GOATS BLEATING)
Amateurs.
NYX: Sherriff,
I need your light.
BOONE: What are you doing?
No wonder
this didn't work.
BOONE: What didn't work?
Well, they summoned
something,
but they couldn't hold it.
(BOONE GRUNTS)
Light, Sheriff.
Light!
(SIGHS) Well,
that's not good.
(LEAVES RUSTLING)
Who are you?
NYX: It's all right.
It's all right.
Come here.
Oh.
Well, you are
something special.
Those idiots didn't know
what to do with you, did they?
That's all right.
It's okay.
I know all about you.
I know
where you're from.
I know
what you need.
(SNARLING)
Mayl show you something?
(SNARLING)
Don't be scared.
Here.
A pretty crown
for a pretty princess.
NYX: Hmm?
I want to help you
because you are perfect.
There.
Now we can be friends.
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTS)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(MOANS)
(PANTING)
(BOTH GRUNT)
Tell me what you want.
(MUMBLES)
You know what I want.
Say it.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Look at me.
Look at me, slut.
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
It's fine. Whatever.
Oh, no. God.
I'm sorry, no.
No, no, no. Hey.
Hey, it's cool,
it's fine.
No... "Slut" is cool.
Slut, I can do slut...
Slut.
Okay, ready?
I don't know. Okay.
Take two.
Okay.
(MOANS)
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Just... It's like...
Like, this is why we can't
role play, you know?
'Cause, like, am I
supposed to be me
or am I supposed to be...
Yeah, you're you.
And you're
like a slut, right?
No, right?
(BOTH LAUGH)
Sorry, I don't know.
God, can't we just be
Jonah and Eva?
Eva's who I want.
I know.
I just wanted to make sure you
remember that this weekend.
I will.
Of course I will.
You know I want you
to have fun, I do,
and strippers
are one thing...
Who said anything
about strippers?
I did and I say
they're fine.
Get some ones,
some fives,
put a few girls through
college, everybody wins.
Just stay away from the
seedy dives, yeah.
The seedy dives?
You know, the ones where the girls
don't really want to be there.
Oh, God. Eva, no, I'm not
into that kind of stuff.
You know me.
I do.
I also know your brother.
Heads up, pussies!
We gotta lay down some
ground rules, all right?
Rule number one, no texting or
calling girlfriends slash fianc√©es
once we make landfall, all right?
This is dude time.
We don't want anything getting
back to the bride-to-be.
All right? I've seen that
shit happen and it's brutal.
Yo, ear buds out.
Oh, what's up?
Come on, man.
All right,
matter of fact,
everyone give me
their cell phones.
All right?
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Hey, watch the road.
I got it, I got it, relax.
Please don't kill me.
Relax, all right?
I don't want you guys
sending out any damn tweets,
get my main man
in trouble over here
while he's trying
to get his freak on.
All right,
rule number two.
We say "yes".
We don't say "maybe",
we don't say, "Gee, I don't know.
I've never..."
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
And we damn sure
don't say "no".
We say "yes"
to living
and "yes"
to living it up!
Do you feel me?
Yes!
Yes!
"Gee, I don't know, I've
never..." (BLOWS RASPBERRY)
MAC: That's it.
ELLIOT: Whatever happened
to Vegas?
Vegas is shit, man.
It's hot as balls and it
smells like hot balls.
Trust me. Garden City
is where we want to be.
See that?
That's the spot.
The hottest place
on the East Coast, baby!
Let's light this up!
Woo-hoo!
This place sucks.
Uh, no, it's...
It's okay.
She's wearing flip-flops.
I almost forgot.
Um, I got some groomsmen's
gifts for you guys.
What?
JONAH: Thanks for coming.
Such a Boy Scout.
Love you.
Classic Jonah.
Always prepared.
Oh, cool, you hate 'em.
No, we don't.
Yeah, you do.
No.
No, you never know
when you need to
open a {my
home oi beer.
Stop. You know what? We love them.
Thank you, Jonah.
(SIGHS)
Don't we?
I love it, Jonah.
Let's drink
till they're hot.
I know, man.
It should've been you.
What? No.
Hey, look, lwouldn't
want the responsibility.
No, I want you
to have it, man.
You are my best man.
You are.
See, like, this is
the difference, like,
when I tell you that I had to
pick Mac over you, you get it,
but if I were to tell him, like,
"I'm picking you over my brother,"
he'd just never let it go.
Look, it's fine. Who cares?
How are you feeling?
You ready
for next week?
Oh, yeah. I feel great.
I mean, I'm not nervous, but then
that kind of makes me nervous,
you know what I mean?
Does that make sense?
It's gonna be fine,
buddy.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, big boy.
Hi.
How about a dance? Oh. You know what?
He would love one.
I got it.
Okay.
Enjoy, my man.
Thank you.
Oh, here?
Yeah, it's just kind of like I'm not
really feeling anything right now,
but I feel like I should be
feeling something, you know?
I guess so. Yeah.
Like, what if I'm
actually really nervous,
but I put, like, all my
emotions on mute or something
just so I can
get through it,
and I wake up in like a year or a
month or something and I realize
that I'm trapped and I
just totally freak out?
No way, man.
Eva is awesome.
Yeah.
It's gonna be great.
Yeah. You two are
perfect for each other.
She's the best. It's...
Yeah, it's disgusting.
Yeah, I love her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's alcohol abuse, dude.
Don't spill it.
(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)
Yo, brother,
it's declined.
All right.
Use that one.
I'll take another one.
Bullshit, isn't it?
Excuse me?
The club.
I can read it
on your face.
Yeah? Well,
stop reading my face.
(LAUGHS)
Sorry. It's just...
You hear all these stories
about Garden City,
it's supposed to be the greatest
underground party scene.
Well, there's nothing here
I couldn't see in Tampa.
My baby brother's getting married
next week and I'm the best man,
and I have to deliver.
I hear ya.
Look, I know a place.
I'm talking... A place.
This thing is dripping with
pussy, the music's amazing.
The vibe.
Makes this place look like
fucking Sunday school.
I can probably get you in.
But only if you
and your boys are serious.
Or you can stay here,
drink that bottle,
go home and pass out,
and in your drunken dreams, maybe
come close to the things I've seen.
A toast to Jonah.
All right?
Man of the hour,
and lamb
for the slaughter.
He's younger than me,
he's less handsome,
much thinner penis...
That's not true.
(RAND CHUCKLES)
Don't interrupt.
It's not.
But in spite of all that,
you're moving on up, man.
And you're marrying up.
God, she's got money.
You're surpassing me, bro.
You're making
an honest woman out of Eva,
and a man out of yourself.
ALL: Cheers.
Mmm. Mmm.
Thank you, bro.
Yes, sir.
And that concludes
opening ceremonies.
What?
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Oh, no, no, no.
No.
Here you go.
That's for you.
ELLIOT: Shrooms.
Yup.
Like an old friend.
(CHUCKLES)
Here you go.
Thank you, sir.
Yup.
Wow.
Mmm.
See this Wyatt Earp son of a bitch
over here at the end of the bar?
Says he can show us
to the real Garden City.
That guy?
There's this club, man.
It's very underground.
He's going there now
and he says we can follow him.
Uh, no.
We don't say "no".
Rule number two, no "no's".
Rule number four...
Always trust a dude with a dick
duster on his face like that, man.
It's a con.
You think so?
Yes.
Then we vote.
Look, if you guys came here with a
matching set of sack, all right,
and you came here to do
what you came here to do,
then you seize your destiny
and you show your support,
and you gobble that mushroom
down like a Mario Brother.
I already did mine.
Rand's in. Yeah!
I didn't say that. No.
Actually, I'm kind of tired.
What? You can be tired when
you're married and Eva's fat.
How about it, Duncan?
ELLIOT:
I'm the designated driver.
Hey, we'll cab it.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not leaving my car here
in this shady-ass strip mall.
As long as we get there in 30
minutes or so, we're fine.
All right.
I'm in.
(LAUGHS) Oh, yes.
Oh, nice.
Attaboy.
I think I took two.
Jonah! Jonah!
ALL: (CHANTING) Jonah! Jonah!
Jonah! I've never shroomed!
Really?
Jonah!
(ALL CHEER)
Woo! Attaboy!
ELLIOT: How far away
is this place?
MAC: He said it's
hard to tell sometimes.
"It's hard to tell"?
(LAUGHS)
Why?
It moves.
The hell does that mean?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
How are you holding up?
You got 10 minutes or so, man.
MAC: See any colors yet?
I see red...
Taillights.
And that's it. There's
nothing else out here, man.
Hey, man, this is
a bad idea, man.
Yeah, Mac.
ELLIOT: Yeah.
Seriously, we should
probably just turn around.
ELLIOT: Oh, come on. Jonah
is the man of the night.
I think we should
listen to Jonah.
Jonah says, "Go."
So let's go.
I didn't say, "Go." He
just said, "Turn around."
Jonah said, "Go."
I'm speaking for Jonah.
Jonah says,
"Go." Let's go.
RAND: We don't even know
where this place is.
ELLIOT: Really, man. MAC: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's turning.
Follow him, follow him.
Okay, okay.
MAC: Right there,
right there, right there.
He's gonna kill us all out here
and it's gonna be your fault.
MAC: Just relax.
RAND: This guy has us
on a dirt road, man.
MAC: Where the hell are we?
I love it.
ELLIOT: Well, we're out in the woods.
That's for certain.
MAC: Only good things happen in the woods.
Everybody knows that.
Arbor Day.
Arbor Day
happens in the woods.
JONAH: What is this guy doing?
ELLIOT: Okay,
now he just turned off.
RAND: He just turned off, man.
Don't lose him.
RAND: Shit.
Oh, shit.
(CHUCKLES)
Oh...
All right, dude.
Welcome to 50nl40w.
Are you guys coming?
After you.
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYS)
Brought you
some new friends.
Boys, step inside.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(APPLAUSE)
Hey.
You all right, man?
I'm messed up, man.
This place is messed up.
Yeah, it is.
(LOUD STOMPING)
(STOMPING)
(ALL CLAPPING RHYTHMICALLY)
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have some first-timers
with us here tonight!
They're here for
a very special occasion
and that calls for some
very special treatment.
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your paws together.
Happy stag party!
Jonah!
(APPLAUSE)
Did you set this up?
Don't look at me, man.
No.
Look at me.
Gentlemen, welcome.
Thank you
so much for coming.
I'm the proprietor
and you can call me Nyx.
Coming up next,
the lovely Miss Torin.
(APPLAUSE)
NYX: You boys
are with me.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
So, Jonah, we have worlds
of experiences here.
What is your particular
flavor of poison?
Um...
(SIGHS) Who's the best man?
Here.
What's he want?
Something wild.
Mmm-hmm.
And private.
All right.
Yeah, but...
But no sex.
No sex as in the act
or no sex as in no gender?
Uh...
The act.
He's getting married
next week.
Got it.
I have just the thing.
Gentlemen,
come right on in.
Make yourselves
comfortable.
MAC: Well, money is no object.
(NYX CHUCKLES)
Well, of course it is.
That's all it is.
And what are objects,
ultimately, but worthless?
But, what in this world
has worth?
Experience! (CHUCKLES)
Experience!
And experiences
are what I deal in.
So, you're saying
there's no charge.
Now, did I say that?
(LAUGHS)
NYX: All right.
You ready to do this?
Sure.
All right!
Oh. no. no, no.
This is just for Jonah.
This is a private show.
The more men in the room, the
more diluted the experience.
Well, I don't know.
What? I don't know.
I don't know.
ELLIOT: Are you married yet?
Mmm-mmm.
Are you married?
No.
Not yet, technically.
So do it for us.
ELLIOT: Do it for me.
NYX: Yeah, what do you say?
They buy the ticket,
you take the ride.
Hmm? Hmm?
Hold this for me.
(NYX CHUCKLES)
Yeah.
Hey.
Keep your pants on?
Yeah.
You ready for a peek
behind door number one?
And away we go.
Have fun.
(WOMAN LAUGHING IN DISTANCE)
(GASPS) Shit!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Can you see me?
(EXHALES)
Now we talk payment.
I want the fondest memory
of your mother
from each of you.
(SCOFFS)
NYX: All of you.
Now, you give me that,
and Jonah will have a night
he will never forget.
(STAMMERING)
I'm sorry.
You want us to tell you about the best
time that we had with our mothers?
No. I want the memory of it.
Now, it won't take
but a moment,
and the most beautiful part about
it is, is you won't even miss it.
You can't miss a memory you can't
even remember, now can you?
That's right.
Do we have a deal?
Deal.
Yeah, okay.
(CHUCKLES)
Sure.
All right, gentlemen,
I'm gonna need you all
to look at your shoes.
Our what?
Look at your shoes.
What am I looking for?
Go on.
Look at your shoes.
Look down.
Look down
and think of mother.
NYX: (CLAPS)
And we're done.
ELLIOT: That's it?
That's it!
NYX: Paid in full.
Go on!
Go have a great evening!
Come on, get out
of here! Scat.
Can I get a receipt
or something?
NYX: Get the fuck out!
ELLIOT: Okay.
I'm sorry. Am I supposed
to do something or...

We are paid in full.
Okay? I want one of them
worm drinks right there.
It's a leech.
Leech drink.
You're not scaring me, okay?
If I don't like it,
my funeral.
What do you call this?
Murder.
Hmm?
(LAUGHS)
Cheers.
Nicely done, Duncan.
(LAUGHS)
MAC". Whoa!
Hey, dude,
you tatted up?
ELLIOT: What?
No, I'm not tatted up.
No, right here.
Haven't seen
that before.
Hey, hey, hey,
wait, wait, wait.
RAND: You got one too.
Did you do this?
What's the matter?
You don't remember?
LILY: Don't go.
Hello?
Did you say
something?
Oh, shit.
(LILY SOBBING)
Hi. Hi.
Can you hear me?
Hey.
Are you...
Are you okay in there?
Like, do...
Do they have you locked up?
Can you get out?
(EXHALES)
I'm a little high. This
might be a stupid question.
Are you okay
in there?
Where are you?
Shit.
(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)
(SCREAMS)
(SCREAMS)
(VOMITING)
BOTH: Whoa!
MAC: Dude...
Shit.
I'm sorry.
MAC: It's, it's cool.
RAND: Yeah. It's fine.
Happens to the
best of us, man.
RAND: I didn't mean it.
MAN: It's fine.
MAC: Let's go.
I didn't mean to.
(SOBBING)
MAC: Let's get, uh... Let's
get this cleaned up, dude.
Who was she?
Who was she?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus.
MAC: Come on, man. Really?

put him over here, man.
MAC: All right.
RAND: Shit.

Come on. Come on,
let's get out, man.
We have overstayed our welcome.
I need you to come with me.
What?
Come with me.
What happened back there, man?
Is he all right?
MAC: Oh, he... He puked.
All right,
take him to the car,
get it started,
be ready to go.
What?
Just trust me.
What's going on?
I'm about to do
something really stupid.
(WOMAN CONTINUES SCREAMING)
(WHIP CRACKING)
(SCREAMING)
RAND: Are you sure
you know where we're going?
JONAH: Yeah,
I counted the doors.
Jonah. Jonah. What the hell is this place?
JONAH: Shh...
MAN: I wasn't even
gonna come in, you know.
MAN: Thought I'd go easy tonight.
Shit.
MAN: When I bumped into those guys, it
was like it was meant to be, you know?
(LAUGHS)
I think I got lucky there.
I get four.
Full house, right?
One for each of the
boys I brought in.
New fish?
Hey, you be sure to tell him
thank you for me.
For letting me
see my baby again.
Jonah. Jonah,
what is going on?
There's a girl.
What?
In a booth.
She's locked up.
No, locked in,
so guys can get to her, right?
Look, come on, man.
Elliot's sick
and I'm seeing
some really weird shit.
Give me your knife.
Why?
Just give it to me.
Jonah, stop this.
This is like sex trafficking
or something.
Yeah.
Man, of course,
Mac would bring us
to a place
with sex trafficking.
You had sex with her?
No.
Then what happened?
I don't know, really.
She, uh... She sang.
What?
She sang, okay?
Just give me the knife.
It's ridiculous.
What are they doing?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I killed her.
Who did you kill, buddy?
I don't know.
I don't know who she was.
She was young.
What did they put
in that drink?
Our memories.
Two memories.
RAND: What if you're right?
What if it is
sex traffickers, huh?
You know the type of people
you don't wanna mess with?
It's sex traffickers.
That's who, Jonah.
They are going to
know that it's you.
That Nyx guy,
he'll know.
We can't leave her here.
What, can't we make
an anonymous phone call?
Look, I think
she needs help, man.
Like, like, now
and not later.
This is crazy.
Isn't that what
tonight's about? Right?
It's like the last hurrah
for crazy, right?
We say "yes," okay?
Tonight we say, "Yes."
Got it.
(DOOR CREAKING)
Yes. Hello, we're, um,
here to rescue you.
Hi.
Okay.
Hey, you okay?
(SNIFFS)
You want my shirt?
Here you go.
Jonah, come on.
We need to leave.
Hang on.
Here you go.
Take this.
Yeah, you're okay.
Yeah, yeah.
There you go.
JONAH: There you go.
You're fine. Yeah.
All right, hi.
My name's Jonah
and this is Rand.
We can take you out of
here if you wanna go.
Do you wanna go?
You do? Okay.
She wants to go. Come on.
Okay, come on.
Let's go, please.
(ALL PANTING)
Which way?
I don't remember.
I thought you said
you counted the doors.
It wasn't like this before.
There's someone back here, Jonah.
Pick away.
I don't know.
She does.
Shit.
(SHOUTS)
JONAH: Hey. Hey!
Hey, hey. Hey, look,
it's cool, man.
We just... We're trying
to find away out of here.
Can you help us
find a way out of here?
Look, look.
You don't have to do this.
(JONAH SHOUTS)
(GRUNTS)
RAND: Take her, Jonah. Run!
JONAH: Whoa, whoa, Rand. What are you...

We should go back inside.
They said
they'd meet us here.
Yeah,
but I want another drink.
Open the door! Open it.
Where's Rand?
He was with you.
We got separated.
What the hell happened?
There... There was
a girl in the back,
she was locked up,
so we let her out, you know.
(LAUG HS) Thought she was
there against her will.
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)
(WOMAN SHRIEKS)
(ELLIOT CONTINUES LAUGHING)

Okay, we're out of here, man.

We gotta wait for Rand.

This is crap.
Wait, Mac.

Is that your blood?
MAC: This is fucked.
This is fucked.
What the hell is going on?
(ELLIOT CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Where's the girl?
I don't know.
She's not a girl, man.
She's something else.

That could be cool.
No!
Hey, hey. What do you
mean something else?
(TIRES SCREECHING)

Hey...Ahhh!
Hey, wait!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
They're coming back.
Let's go.
Everybody's dying.
Then let's not! Come on.

need that boy now.
Luckily, we have
something that's his
under the C-A-R.
Oh.
Well, hey there.
(BOTH PANTING)
JONAH: Oh, boy.
MAC: Wait, wait.
Where are we going?
You don't know, either.
We're going
this way, Mac, okay?
So I can get a signal on my phone
and I can call the police.
So I can tell them that
two of my friends are dead.
We don't know if that one
guy is actually dead.
"One guy"?
His name is Rand, man.
Rand.
He's been my best friend
for, like, 15 years
and you don't even
know his name.
Yeah, I do.
And Rand might not be dead.
(ARGUING INDISTINCTLY)
(SOFT GROWLING)
(JONAH LAUGHS)
Well, that one guy
might not be dead. Wow.
I'm trying to help.
Oh. Oh, well,
thank you, Mac.
Thank you so much
for your help.
This has been so much fun.
Thank you for
taking your dick out
and swinging it
all over in front of everybody
and thanks for getting two of
my actual friends killed, too.
Thank you for that.
I didn't tell you
to mess with anything.
And I didn't tell you to let anyone
out of any booth. (BRANCHES SNAPPING)
Wait, shut up.
What is that?
(BRANCHES SNAPPING)
Run.
(SOFT GROWLING)
(PANTING)
(GROANS)
Shit.
Oh, God.
(JONAH GROANS)
You Okay?
Come on.
It smells like shit.
Hold on.
Fuck.
It's quicksand.
It's not quicksand.
Well, I'm about to lose my shoe.
Come on!
(MAC GRUNTING)
What does she want?
Me.
When I let her out of
that booth she, like...
She, like, sniffed me.
That's why she took Elliot 'cause he's...
He's wearing myjacket.
Why don't you
lose your clothes then?
Come on, dude.
Stop it!
It's not the first time
I've seen your dick.
It's not the clothes,
you dumb-ass.
The clothes
smell like me.
(GRUNTS)
Oh, shit. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Great idea.
Shit.
Get down.
In that shit?
Shh...
(JONAH BREATHING HEAVILY)
Let's get back
to the road.
If we follow it,
we can find some place.
How's your ankle?
Can you walk?
No. But I can run.
(GRUNTS)
RAND: Oh, shit. Hold on.
(RAND BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GULPS)
Who are you?
What... What?
Who are you?
I'm Rand.
Wilson. Rand Wilson.
Who are you,
Rand Wilson?
I'm... I'm nobody...
No, that's who
you're going to be
if you don't answer
my questions.
What do you want
with the Lilith, hmm?
Who are you?
Is it that little prick
shaman down in Panama City?
No.
Was it him?
(STAMMERING) No. I don't know
anything about that, okay?
I... I... I told you. It was my...
It was our friend, Jonah.
Yeah, it was... It was his
bachelor party. Yeah.
And the man... And the man
there, he brought us here.
We followed him...
(STAMMERS)
You bought it all
with good memories,
so your friend Jonah
could spend some time
with one of my
star attractions.
That's great.
So why did he
let her go?
I don't know.
I don't know, okay?
I... I don't. He thought you
had her locked up in there.
Oh, I did have her
locked up in there
for some very good reasons,
as you have seen.
(BOTH PANTING)
Oh, thank God.
Hey, you okay, son?
No. No.
I'm not okay, officers. POLICEMAN
1: All right, sit down.
Sit, sit. Please.
No.
His friends...
Our friends are dead.
I'm afraid, there's someone
following us.
POLICEMAN 2: Hold on now.
Who is following you?
Shit, shit.
We went to this club
in the swamp.
And...
It's... It's 50-something.
JONAH: This guy...
Hey, why don't... Why don't you
get these boys some water?
All right, just catch your breath.
Breathe.
Ma'am, get some water
for these boys.
POLICEMAN 1: All right?
JONAH: Yeah, I'm fine.
And the check too, please.
(JONAH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
We're busy.
Found 'em.
Couple of cops picked 'em up at
a diner on the edge of town.
Well, what do you know
about that?
Take 'em into the church,
make everything ready.
So that's really it, huh?
Yes.
That's all of it?
Just some failed knight
in shining armor bit?
Yes, I swear...
I swear to God, that's it.
That's it, yes.
Well, that does make
things easier.
No. God. Please, wait. Wait.
Please, don't. Please, don't.
Please, don't.
NYX: I wouldn't move
if I was you.
Now, you know, I think you owe my
associate, Barry, here an apology.
Because of your friend's
thoughtless actions
he now has a very deep
personal family tragedy
to deal with.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
Tell him!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please. I just...
I wanna leave. lwanna go home.
I'm so sorry.
We both know your brother
is irreplaceable.
Don't blame the Lilith.
Blame them.
No, no, no, please.
No. I said, I'm sorry. I...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please. I wanna go home.
Shh.
RAND: What is he doing?
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
NYX: Well, um...
He's gonna hurt you for
awhile and I'm gonna watch.
I... I told you
everything I know, okay?
I believe you.
I believe you. I know.
RAND: God! Please, no.
Please, please. Please stop.
Please stop.
But you boys stuck your hand
in the fire tonight
and it is my right
to see you get burned.
Why? Why?
Why?
'Cause you messed
with the wrong motherfucker.
(SHRIEKING) No!
But she took off into the woods.
I don't know where she went.
POLICEMAN 1: Oh, but
you guys got away.
Yeah.
We followed the road.
This is the first place
that we saw.
All right,
you boys on something?
No. No. We absolutely are not.
Yes, yes.
Please take me
to the station.
Just get me
out of here, please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jonah.
Come on, man. Come...
No, come on.
They said take him
to the church.
Wait, who said that?
JONAH: Who said that?
Wait.

Let's give Jonah something
to really think about, hmm?
You got it.
Rand... (SNAPPING FINGERS)
Look down.
Now bear with us.
In a moment,
you won't even

Shit, I shouldn't have called.
I interrupted your party.
JONAH: No, no, no.
I actually really need to
hear your voice right now.
Are you okay?
EVA: Um, yeah.
It's stupid. I just...
I had this dream that I
couldn't find you and then...
When I woke up, you weren't
here and I even got up
and went to look
for you in the kitchen.
Don't know, then I just got
this bad feeling like...
(PANTING)
Like I needed to talk to you.
I really wanna
talk to you right now too.
I don't know if I, uh,
if I can right now.
EVA". Jonah, Jonah.
Hello? Eva?
(VOICE BREAKING)
Can you...
Listen, listen.
Uh, something happened. Um...
Elliot... (SNIFFLES)
He's dead and...
And Rand, he's...
EVA: Are you there?
Hello?
Damn it.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Eva, Eva, listen to me.
Uh, listen. I don't know
if you can hear me.
But, um...
My phone's about to die and I just
wanna tell you that I love you.
I love you so much.
EVA: That's scary.
What did you do?
(CHUCKLES) Nothing. No.
I just... (INHALES)
Really wanted to say it.
(PANTING)
There's no place in the world I'd
rather be than home with you right now.
Yeah.
Are you there?
Hello? (PANTING)
(SOBBING)
(SNIFFLES)
(SOBBING)

(GASPING)
Rough night?
Get the hell out of here.
Brought you a drink.
I'm not thirsty.
I'm not patient.
I was supposed to be
off work two hours ago.
So you gonna
drink that or not?
Because if not...
(COCKS GUN)
I'm supposed to kill you.
JONAH: Okay, okay.
Right. (INHALES)

RAND: No, wait. Please.
(SCREAMING)
(BONE CRACKING)
(RAND GROANING)
Jonah, are you...
There you are.
Hi, Jonah.
Well, as you can feel, or
remember feeling, I've obviously put
Rand into a great deal of pain.
Now, he's not dead. Not yet.
But that can change.
And will.
If we can't make a deal.
So, you have my girl and I,
obviously, have your man.
So, let's make a trade. Hmm?
No games, no tricks.
Everybody can walk away
with what they want.
My associate will
give you all the details
and, uh...
I'll be seeing you soon.
T cache-no.
(WHIMPERING)
He wants to make
atrade. (PANTING)
It's your choice, man.
I'm just the messenger.
But that girl, I don't have her.
She's not with me.
She's following you.
Taking you to him is
as good as taking her.
(SNIFFLES)
Then take me to him.
Yes, sir.
(INSECTS CHIRPING)
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
Tick took, Jonah.
Your old friend's inside and I don't
wanna be here when the new one shows up.
NYX: NW, m'!-
Hell is empty
and the devils are all here.
You look horrible.
Where's Rand?
No hello, no nothing.
Rude.
Come on.
I'll take you to him.
So she didn't catch you?
(CHUCKLING) She did.
Well, you don't look too worse for wear.
That's something.
I mean, she likes you.
Thing is,
you've been chosen.
You know they mate for life.
We'll use that.
JONAH: You didn't have to hurt Rand,
you could've just brought me here.
No, I didn't have to.
I was willing to and I did.
Don't forget that.
Just... Do what
you're told, Jonah.
And you'll be banging away at
Mrs. Jonah by suppertime tomorrow.
Defy me
and your boy Rand
gets a bullet in the brain he'll
be thinking about forever.
What is this?
Think of it like
a shock collar for dogs.
Except for her kind.
Helps prevent incidents like this evening.
Keeps her in line,
makes her more
susceptible to suggestion.
No, no, no, no.
That's for you.
You're going to put it on her.
Me?
Yes, you.
Why do you think
I brought you here?
She and I have a
complicated history.
Besides, you're probably the only one
she trusts enough to let get close.
Magic?
Sure.
(WHISPERING) Magic.
Like everything else, people like
you will just never understand.
Now, when our little
transaction is complete,
you and, uh,
Mr. Gimpy are free to go.
Don't worry.
(WHISPERING) Won't be long.
Rand. God. Rand.
Are you all right?
I'm so sorry, Rand.
I'm so sorry.
They did this to you...
RAND: What'd they do?
Wha...
What's up?
What did you say?
Jonah.
What?
What did they do to me?
(EXHALES)
Listen to me.
I'm going home to Eva
and I'm taking you with me.
All right?
Hmm.
Hmm.

I didn't know

I just want to go home.
Do you?
NYX: She's a killer, Jonah.
You know that.
Now put her back
where she belongs.
She belongs to me.
Do it. Now.
How about we go home?
Both of us.
To our own homes.
And we just leave it at that.
You're wasting time.
