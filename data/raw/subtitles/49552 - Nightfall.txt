Chicago, sir?
Evanston.
No. No call
for Evanston.
Nightfall and you
Lovely you
Underneath a wreath
of heaven's pale blue
You are poetry
You are melody
You're a prayer
that's granted
I'm enchanted
Nightfall and dreams
Lovely dreams
Underneath a wreath
of golden moonbeams
In those hours small
You're my all in all
You're my poem
Of nightfall, dear
Got a light?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Ah, those busses always
run late at this hour.
Traffic.
It's gonna be a hot one tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, I wonder how they
stand it in the tropics.
They're born into it.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess that
does make the difference.
That's for me, though.
You know, the tropics?
Have you ever
been there?
During the war.
I didn't make it.
Bum ticker.
See much action?
A little.
Uh-huh.
Where were you?
Okinawa.
Oh.
The furthest I ever got off
Hollywood Boulevard was Yosemite.
We used to go up there
in the summers, you know,
before things got tough.
Hard going, huh?
Ah, lately.
What do you do
for a living?
Research. I'd better
be getting home.
My wife'll think I stopped
off to get a couple of shots.
Thanks.
Is this one free?
She's alone, if that's what you mean.
Vodka on the rocks
with a lemon twist.
A little twist
or a big twist?
You look like
the big-twist type.
What would you think if I asked
you to loan me five dollars?
That's what
I thought.
What makes you
think I've got five?
You smell like you just
came from a barbershop.
A man doesn't go to the
barbershop when he's down and out.
You're very bright.
I'm in a silly spot,
that's what I am.
Look, I forgot my wallet
or I lost it. I don't know.
But I do know that man's
going to want his money.
I can't sit here all
night with a warm martini.
I understand.
How about letting me
buy you a cold one?
From that last remark, I
can see you don't understand.
I'll send it to you
in the morning.
You sound as if
you mean it.
Here's my license. You can
copy the serial number down.
Marie Gardner.
807 North Normandy.
The serial number is usually here
in the upper right-hand corner.
So it is.
Please!
Oh, everybody
seems pretty busy.
Thank you.
Check, please.
Seventy. Out of five.
Wait a minute. Can I buy you a drink?
No girl ever has.
What's that
you're drinking?
A vodka. And I'll have another martini.
Do you mind
if I just look?
See anything familiar?
Familiar looks
very different.
Do you make it a habit
of rescuing girls in bars?
Only girls who drink
martinis on empty purses.
How come you're in here
in the first place?
My girlfriend stood
me up for dinner.
I didn't want
to eat alone.
But it's all right
to drink alone.
I was hoping I'd run into
somebody nice to talk to.
A girl like you?
The men I usually run into don't want
to talk to anybody but their wives.
Or secretaries.
They seem to think
conversation's old-fashioned.
You sound bitter.
Case hardened.
Guys have probably been
swarming around you ever since
your second teeth
came through.
Maybe you're disillusioned.
I don't know,
but I don't think to the point where
you're ready to throw all men aside.
Do I hear a click?
Yes.
I, uh, like to skip
all the jockeying around.
It saves a lot
of grief later on.
What makes you think there's
going to be a later on?
I mean like
dinner, maybe?
As long as we understand each other.
I'd certainly
appreciate it.
You sound like a man
with a problem.
Vanning.
Jim Vanning's my name.
Yeah, I got problems.
Who hasn't?
Would you like a booth? Yes, please.
Hello, Mrs. Fraser.
Hello, Mr. Fraser.
Tired?
Yeah, a little. Yeah.
Anything new?
Still checking.
Vanning still there?
Yeah. Yeah, I talked
to him tonight.
You talked to him?
Well, you know,
I went up and asked
him for a light.
Did he say anything?
Nothing I could use.
My, it's a tough one.
I took your brown suit
to the cleaner's today.
Uh-huh. You could use
another pair of shoes.
Well, I'll wait
for the sales.
You never buy
yourself anything.
I do all right.
You do fine. Someday you'll be important.
Honey, there's nothing important
about being an insurance investigator.
Boy, I wish
this one was over with.
You'll handle it.
Hmm, thanks.
He didn't get much work done
this afternoon, you know.
He just kept walking
up and down his room.
He kept looking
at a calendar he's got
tacked up on the back
of the closet door.
Do you think he knows
he's being watched?
I had the glasses
on him.
He kind of grows on you.
You know what I mean, Laura?
It's almost... Well, almost
like he needs protection.
What you need is a drink
and some lamb stew. Come on.
Okay.
You know, I still
don't understand it.
A lot of nice people get
together in bars and restaurants.
Yeah, to cry on each other's shoulders.
And to go back to their
wives the next morning.
Is that a question?
Do I look like
a married man?
You've told me so little about yourself,
you might be any one
of several people.
Or the creature
from 20,000 Fathoms.
I was just curious.
Thanks.
What time is it?
Early.
I have an 8:00 sitting in the
morning and a 12:00 fashion show.
You're a model?
How do you think
I pay the rent?
Well, I should have figured.
Your being a model, I mean.
Believe it or not,
I'm an artist.
Soup cans or sunsets?
Soup cans, toothpaste, automobiles,
and girls once in a while.
I bet you must be
good at it.
I freelance,
work at my own place.
I do all right.
I have a rush job
for a magazine story.
You wouldn't pose
for me, would you?
I'm expensive.
But, for you,
I'll waive the fee.
You're actually smiling.
Back there at the bar,
you acted as though
you had some big trouble
on your shoulders.
They come and they go.
Troubles?
Smiles.
Would you write your phone
number and address for me?
I forget things.
Not important
things, I hope.
How about tomorrow?
All right. Pick me up at
Robinson's, Beverly Hills.
I should be finished
around 2:00.
Okay.
Is this the later on
you were talking about?
The first part.
Any questions about
the rest of it?
You mean the
later, later on?
No questions.
Providing
you don't ask any.
Okay.
All right, Rayburn.
Thanks, miss.
You can go now.
You did a nice job getting
our friend here so relaxed.
Why, you...
You do
your talking later.
You run along home now, and
forget you ever saw this character.
You're not going to run anymore, are you?
Don't!
Come on, we'll all go down to
the beach and get some breeze.
We're gonna
need clear heads.
You've been giving us
a bad time, Rayburn.
Or what are you calling
yourself these days?
Anyway, you cost us a lot
of money trying to find you.
And it ain't
deductible, either.
Will you
shut up?
I don't mind that. I like
the way you handled yourself.
One, you didn't
go to the police.
Fat chance!
And two, you didn't make
trouble. You just disappeared.
I like that, too.
Only it's a little too
soon for you to disappear.
And now all you got to do is
tell us what we want to know,
and we'll let you out
and you can go home.
We're not even
gonna tell the cops.
I got a picture
of that!
You're going to tell
us sooner or later.
That's something
I can't do.
Well, that's
'cause you're tough.
But after we get you where
you're not so tough anymore,
you're going to tell us. You'll
say anything we want you to say.
I'm not trying to get hurt.
If I knew, I'd tell you.
That's in the hearts
and flowers department.
You know where
that'll get you!
Nowhere.
Then we'll
all be nowhere.
He's too tough, John.
A lot too tough.
What do you say, John?
I say he's too tough.
I'm not tough.
I'm scared stiff.
Oh,
now he's being funny.
You want to drive, John, and
let me sit back there with him?
No, you take it easy, Red.
You hold on a little while,
you can have your fun later.
Fun?
The tougher they are
The more fun they are
Tra-la
Feel better?
Yeah.
Look, Red,
tonight's his night.
Might be a short one,
might be a long one.
But he's going
to keep breathing
until we get an answer
out of him, you got that?
Oh, John,
you got a soft spot.
Like the top
of your head!
That's your whole trouble,
you know that?
The top of your head never
closed up when you were a kid.
Neither did
your mouth.
Smart boy. No identification. No address.
That way, if he's got it where he's
living, we don't know where he's living at.
What about laundry tags?
Now, what if you found a mark on his
collar? What would you do with it, huh?
Well, now the police are always
tracing guys with laundry tags.
Huh. Well, well, well.
Marie Gardner.
807 North Normandy.
It must be the one
he was with tonight.
Welcome back, friend.
Why don't you
get it over with?
That's a switch. What do you
think I'm going to do, kill you?
Yeah. Yeah, I think
you're going to kill me.
It could have been any time since
last winter. So it's tonight.
He's acting pretty cool.
Why not?
With 350,000 clams,
why couldn't he be cool?
I guess it's the money, huh? It
gives you that nice, easy feeling?
I don't know
where the money is.
Now say that again.
Say it over to yourself and
see how ridiculous that sounds.
"Don't know where
the $350,000 is."
That's the way it is.
Nice suit.
I like it.
Pick it out yourself?
Yes.
Expensive?
Not bad.
Not the kind of suit I'd buy if I had
all that money you're talking about.
Now, listen, you've got a
fair amount of intelligence.
You're on one side.
I'm on the other.
So, we'll take it
from there, huh?
Now, if you want
to stay alive,
in order for you to have a
nice, long, happy middle age,
you're going to tell us
where you put that cash.
Then we're going to keep
you here until we get it.
Then we'll let you go.
Make sense?
Makes wonderful sense, but I
can't tell you where the money is
'cause I don't know where
it is. Does that make sense?
No, no, it doesn't.
I can see a man misplacing
a tenner or maybe even $100.
But it just don't tabulate he's
going to let a big boodle like that
slip through
his fingers.
And that brings us
to another angle.
If you lost that loot, you lost it up
in Wyoming in the Jackson Hole country.
And that means
you wouldn't be here,
because if you didn't have it, you'd
be up there looking for it. Right?
Wyoming's a big place.
$350,000 is big money.
Most people I know would be up
there with a magnifying glass
going over every inch
of the state.
We're getting nowhere.
Now put yourself
in my place.
I'm real hungry
for that cash.
I'm so hungry for it, I'm even
liable to cut you in for a slice.
$50,000. How does
that sound?
It sounds great, but I tell
you I don't know where it is.
Is that final?
As far as I'm concerned,
they're his final words.
No, not yet.
Not final.
Get up!
Now, don't get any ideas
about night watchmen.
You got all the company you're
gonna get right now. Come on!
Ben?
It's okay, honey.
Go back to sleep.
Can I get
you something?
No, no, thanks.
What is it?
Why can't you sleep?
Oh, angles.
Angles I can't figure.
Aw, you'll
work it out.
Yeah. With what I've got now,
I could take him in tomorrow.
With what they've
got on him in Chicago,
it's 100-to-one
he'd get the chair
and the money would
still be missing.
That's why it's hard
to go to sleep.
Well, if that's what he deserves. lf!
Is there an "if"?
If I could only talk
to him, really talk!
You know, get him to tell
me just what happened.
Ben, you're doing
all you can.
Yeah, that's what's
driving me crazy.
It's the best shadow job
I've ever done.
I know every move he makes.
It's gotten to the point
I can drop him at night and
pick him up again in the morning.
I know he likes split pea soup for lunch.
He leaves
a dime tip when,
you know, sometimes he
should have left 15 cents.
He washes his own socks at night.
He goes to sleep with the radio on.
And, oh, incidentally,
it's got a bum tube.
The static is terrible.
Yeah, I know everything about
him except what I need to know.
He's clever then,
living the way he does
and hiding the money.
Maybe. Or maybe
he's innocent.
You keep feeling that, don't you?
He can't be
alone in this.
There's got to be more than
a single in the picture.
I've been walking in his
footsteps for three months,
day after day,
hour after hour.
I've been through his room when he was out.
I've been living
his life, practically.
You know, I feel as if I understand
this man, as if I really know him.
I'm glad you followed me,
Ben, 11 years ago. Really glad.
Yeah,
and you'd be even gladder
if we could get back
to sleep tonight, huh?
Oh, honey,
look at the time.
Once every
five seconds, watch.
One, two, three,
four, five.
How's your memory
now, friend?
Now think back.
You were out camping,
Wyoming, just you and
your pal, the doc. Right?
And maybe you'll remember
what you did with the money.
Our money.
... could give the area its
first below-freezing night.
The highways are expected to
become icy and very dangerous.
Special bulletin from the
ranger station in this area.
Campers are advised to leave as soon as
possible to avoid the danger of being snowed in.
Now turning to
the international scene...
We'd better pack up
and get out of here.
Temperature's dropping
below freezing.
The weather station reports a snowfall
of eight inches in the mountains
and more coming.
They're closing down
the highway north of here.
If that cold front moves in
on us, we're really in trouble.
Cold or no cold, Doc, right
now we're gonna eat trout,
fried the only way
to fry them.
Plenty of butter
and bread crumbs.
Well, I've always been
a cornmeal man myself.
Doc, you stick to the medicine.
I'll stick to the cooking.
That's a deal.
Well, what do you
think we ought to do?
Do what the man says.
Take the road south,
first thing in the morning.
We haven't even had two weeks of
this, and I could use two months.
No deadlines to meet, no art directors
calling in the middle of the morning.
How about you?
You ready for surgery?
Far from it.
Anyway, we came to
do some hunting.
What's it gonna look like if we get
back to Chicago without a set of horns?
How about that big buck we saw
yesterday morning across the valley?
Standing there like
the Statue of Liberty.
A beauty, wasn't he?
Why didn't you shoot?
Why didn't you?
Hey, you know,
I think you're right.
The bread crumbs are
better than the cornmeal.
Great coffee, huh?
Eh.
Better than I ever
got in the Navy.
You know, you'll make
some gal a good husband.
Oh, yeah.
She just hasn't come
along yet. Is that it?
Yeah, I guess
that's it.
Well, you'll know it
when she does.
Just like I knew
Eva was right for me.
Of course, I suppose 20 years
does make a lot of difference.
Probably a lot
of people figure that
I should have married
someone more my own age.
Oh, what's 20 years?
Has she ever said
anything about it to you?
No. Why should she?
Well, you're
our best friend.
You know, I've been wanting to talk
about this ever since we got up here.
I figured that up here,
away from everything
and everybody,
that I could tell you
how much I appreciate...
Doc!...your strength of character.
Eva's still young, and she
hasn't shaken herself down yet.
And some other
man might have...
It's been a good 10
days. Good for all of us.
Look!
He's going
to go over!
You got the car keys? They're in the car.
You two are pretty lucky.
Anybody else down there?
There now.
Here. There, let me
have a look at that arm.
We'll get this coat off.
Careful now.
Come on, it's all right.
This goes with my job.
There we go.
Now, let's see here.
All right. Well, that feels
just like a simple fracture.
I'll put a temporary
splint on it.
Oh, you're really lucky. This
could have been an awful lot worse.
Well, you got
a point there.
Uh, get me a couple
of flat sticks.
All right. The man here says we're lucky.
Yeah, we're
loaded with luck.
Here, Doc. Oh, those are
fine. Here, put this one here.
All right! All right! Come
on. Come on. Snap it up!
Will you shut up?
I'm trying to think
of what we gotta do.
We'll take you into Moose. It's
only about seven miles from here.
I want to get
some X-rays of this arm.
Oh, that's
all we need.
There we are.
I'll have to
take your tie.
It won't make much of a sling,
but it'll do temporarily.
Fix the sling, Doc.
Whose car's that?
Mine.
Give me your wallet.
Come on, give me
your wallet.
I'll need your registration,
driver's license.
I wouldn't drive
anyplace without that.
Here?
Too public.
Well, the snow'll cover 'em over,
and the roads will be closed.
Nobody'll be coming in
here until spring.
I said it was
too public, Red.
You guys camped
around here?
Don't make me use
my head, will you?
Let's go.
Look, why don't you just take
the car and leave us here?
We don't know who you
are or anything about you.
Well, you've had plenty of time to think.
How about it,
coming back?
Well, maybe we can get this thing
straightened out and everything will be fine.
And dandy.
Don't forget the dandy.
Oh, yeah, dandy.
What do you say, John?
This is what they call the
point of no return, friend.
Suppose you knew you were going
to get killed if you didn't talk.
Wouldn't you talk?
Would I talk? I'd be a one-man filibuster.
You
think I wouldn't?
I think you're sore. I think you're
sore 'cause we caught up with you.
Either that or you're
one of those birdbrains
who figures it's a trend
to be brave or something.
All I can tell you,
it's still up there.
Where up there?
I don't know.
Well, just let me put one of
his feet in, John. Just one.
He's not fooling.
When Red was a kid, they
didn't have enough playgrounds.
He's sort of
an adult delinquent.
I've seen him
in action.
How are you
at belly shots, Red?
Or do you only
shoot at backs?
Red!
Go ahead, Red.
Pull the trigger.
Yes?
Vanning.
Go away!
Please!
What do you want?
A few honest words.
From you?
There's an explanation due.
I don't want to hear it.
The only thing you'll hear is
yourself talking, start now!
You need a doctor.
Nice place. I'll try not
to bleed over everything.
There might be one doctor I
know I might reach at this hour.
Skip the milk of
human kindness routine.
Remember me?
I've already been
set up in Alley One.
I'm back from the wars, honey. I'm a vet!
How'd you get tied up
with those two?
You don't belong in the picture with
them and you know it as well as I do.
Money!
Sure. That's why you did
it, you did it for money.
Do you always answer
your own questions?
Then why did
you help them?
I wasn't helping them.
And so what if I had been.
What difference would it
make? You did something wrong.
You were running away, and
you were bound to be caught.
That's all I know.
That's all I want to know.
Are you being clever
with me again?
I'm not
the clever type, Jim.
It is Jim, isn't it?
Give me a light.
What did you do? How'd you get
yourself involved with the police?
Police? You thought
they were police?
Weren't they?
That's why you
took off so fast.
I came here...
I came like
a homing pigeon.
I didn't even look up
your address.
I must have remembered it from the
bar, from your driver's license.
But that piece of paper you
gave me, they must have it.
And they'll figure
I came back here.
Look, you can't stay here.
Put something on
and pack a bag,
or are you thinking nice people
don't run? They stay. Call the police.
That's exactly
what they do.
Right now two men are
coming over here
to pull you out of your
respectable little world so fast,
you won't know
what hit you.
So, call the police.
Maybe you'll be all right tonight
but what about a week from tonight?
Or next month?
Why me?
I used to ask myself the
same question, "Why me?"
Because you were unlucky
enough to talk to me tonight.
You've got to trust me.
I'm trying to.
Believe me, I'm trying.
It would be easier if
I knew about the men.
I'll tell you about them
when you're dressed.
Leave the door open a
little so you can hear me.
I'm waiting.
Can you hear me now?
Not too well.
Any better?
Much better.
It was in Wyoming
last winter.
Doc Gurston, a friend, a good friend
and I were helping these two men.
Their car had
gone off the road.
Better kill
those bedroom lights.
I won't be
able to see.
Pack in the dark.
You were saying their
car had gone off the road.
And they made us take
them back to our camp.
Okay.
Okay, over there,
over there by the fire.
Sure.
Sure. Why not?
Why not what?
A shooting,
then suicide.
That way,
it keeps us clear.
You surprise me.
It's this mountain air.
I always think better.
I like it, Red. That's neat. Real neat.
I don't know what you two have
done that makes you so desperate.
Are you scared, Doc?
I should be. But I can't
believe this is happening.
Why, we haven't even had
our second cup of coffee.
Oh.
I'm scheduled to perform an
operation in Chicago, Monday.
We were driving into Moose
tonight to call my wife
and tell her we were
leaving in the morning.
It's no use, Ed.
We were only trying to help you!
Oh, this is
very sad.
This is strictly
downhill.
Shut up, Red. You got a
point, friend. You're entitled.
A man shouldn't die unless
he knows he's got a reason.
And you boys
got the best.
You see, Red here and me pulled a bank job,
real sweet, no prints, no identification.
No previous criminal record.
We gotta
protect that, see?
We wouldn't want
to get a bad rep.
We got about
300 grand right here.
So, try to see it
our way, will you?
Okay, Doc,
I'm going to
count to five.
You run.
When I get to five,
I'm gonna shoot.
You got the picture?
Hold it!
One! Two!
Three!
I never could count past three.
Oh!
You didn't get your second
cup of coffee either, did you?
Go ahead.
Well, don't say
I didn't ask you.
Is your car paid for?
I just got it.
Oh, you're lucky.
You won't have to
make any more payments.
Give it to him.
Turn around.
Sit down!
Don't look back here,
just look straight ahead.
Now, here's the action.
I'm gonna toss
you a shell.
Now, you pick up the shell,
put it in the chamber.
Then you pick up the rifle.
You look it straight in the eye,
then you push the trigger.
How do you like that?
I give you
the perfect suicide.
I won't do it!
I'll tell you why
you're gonna do it.
If I have to work you
over from back here,
I figure it's
gonna take me
five, maybe six rounds
to finish the job.
So, make it easy on
yourself. See? Clean, quick!
Come on, Red.
Quit playing around.
You decide.
Want me to start counting like for the doc?
I'll be in the car.
Why are you holding
us up, buster?
Oh!
You're thinking maybe a
quick try with the rifle, huh?
You want to try?
Well, go ahead!
Go ahead! Try!
Give me a minute to get
used to the idea, will you?
Oh, no,
that's too long.
Half a minute!
Okay.
Come on, Red.
Red's shot bounced a
piece of rock off my skull.
It looked like
I was a goner.
At least they thought so. They drove off.
Hey, do you got
a back door?
Marie Gardner.
Afraid of a girl?
Maybe Vanning's inside.
He's not that stupid.
Now, you're taking things too
easy to suit me. I don't like it!
Oh, a model, huh?
Yeah, they all carry
these portfolio things.
"Compton Model Agency, Dunkirk,
7-3-8-9-9." That's all we need.
Oh, you're smooth, John.
Real smooth.
Yeah, I got a soft side.
A guy can't have
everything, can he?
Nope, I don't
suppose he can.
Hello.
Ben?
Yeah.
You're... You're not here!
No, well,
you fell asleep, honey, so I
got dressed and I came over here,
and it's a lucky
thing that I did.
Ben, what time is it?
Oh, about 4:00 a.m.
Talk about intuition.
I told you he was getting
ready to make a move.
Is he still there?
Yeah, yeah, there's
a girl with him, Laura.
My hunch is beginning
to pay off.
I told you I didn't figure
him to be in this thing alone.
Look, honey, you'd better stick
around the apartment today, see,
in case I have to
call you in a rush,
you know, and get you to pack a
suitcase and bring it to me over here.
Where are you going?
I don't know, Laura,
but, well, I've got a hunch
it's going to be cold.
Now, look, you pack a bag for me,
honey, huh? And then go back to sleep.
You still have enough coffee in
that penthouse you're renting?
Yeah, yeah, sure, coffee,
dancing girls, everything!
Okay. Goodnight, hon.
There.
Thanks.
You should have met
a nurse tonight, not me.
Is that the, uh...
Oh, I'll take it.
My laundry.
What on earth are those?
Sock stretchers.
And they talk
about women!
Did you say you had
an early call tomorrow?
Uh-huh.
I'll get you some sheets.
This will be yours.
You can't imagine how many times I've
stood here and watched it get dark.
I know how
every shadow falls.
The telephone pole, the
rooming house across the street,
that old iron fence
down there.
And every night, I got that
much closer to tomorrow,
my chances got
that much better.
What's tomorrow, Jim?
Mind if I...
Tomorrow?
Maybe the next day,
they open up the roads
to the spot where we camped.
The snowplows have been
up there two weeks now.
I've been waiting
for weeks for that date.
I get within one day of it and
bingo, I gotta run into those two.
Maybe you've forgotten.
Organized society has a department
for your kind of complaint.
P-O-L-l-C-E?
Okay, let's say
you're the police.
I tell you two strange men
have a wreck.
The doc and I run out
to help them.
They shoot the doc,
wipe the prints off the rifle,
try to make me kill myself.
It sounds like a nice
routine case, doesn't it?
An everyday occurrence?
Things that really happen are
always difficult to explain.
You haven't heard
anything yet.
There I was,
coming out of...
I don't know how long.
No motion, no nothing.
And then I... I remembered!
I went to get Doc's bag,
so I could patch myself up.
Patch myself up?
Here was a way out.
Somehow they'd taken
the wrong bag,
taken Doc's bag
and left the money behind.
I could drop this satchel
on any police desk and say,
"Find the men who stole this, and
you'll find the men who killed the doc!"
Hey!
I knew I had
the bag with me.
I must have dropped it
someplace. Maybe near that shack.
Well, can't you remember?
No. It started to
snow pretty hard.
I got into Moose
by morning.
A ranger had already found
Doc's body and my rifle.
They were looking for me.
Well, right then and there you
should have told them the whole story.
It doesn't check. What, boogeyman
with a bag full of money?
They must have
left footprints.
The snowfall covered 'em.
Well, you should have
shown them the wrecked car.
The car
they were driving.
That still doesn't put
'em on the spot with me.
No, Marie, I needed a witness,
something that could talk.
You know, something like
that satchel full of money.
And there was
another little detail.
Doc Gurston
had a young wife.
She'd written me
some indiscreet letters.
The Chicago Police found
them in my apartment.
Look.
My prints checked out
with those on the rifle.
Did you love her?
Doc and I were
old friends.
Is that an answer?
Somehow I find it very important
that you believe this right now.
I might have been looking,
but she was shopping.
And it never went any
further than that, believe me.
I believe you.
I rode freights south
to New Orleans
and got a job
on the waterfront,
changed my name to Wilson.
Then I went west
to Dallas.
Drove a truck
there for a while.
Finally, I came out here, bought myself
some paints and holed up right here.
Changed my name
to Vanning.
Finally, after about a month
I got my first assignment.
You know, the payoff,
Eva, that's the doc's wife,
she puts up a reward
for my arrest.
I guess she
could afford it.
She inherited a quarter of a
million without ever leaving Chicago.
You said you were going to Wyoming
as soon as the roads were cleared
to find the money.
Why does it
have to be tonight?
Because they got to me.
But you got away.
They get to you once,
they get to you again.
Anyway, I'm scared.
You don't know
what it is to live
with your back
against the wall, Marie.
Inside, you change.
You really change.
I'll get those sheets.
I'm always meeting
the wrong man.
It's a talent,
forming what the psychiatrists
call "doomed relationships."
Meaning me?
You won't quit?
I can't. They caught up to me tonight.
Sometime, I'd like you
to meet my girlfriend.
The one who stood me up
for dinner tonight.
Right.
They tell me I can get a bus
through to Moose, Wyoming.
We're expecting a clearance on that
run along about 9:00 or 10:00 tonight.
How much?
One way?
No, round trip.
$39.11. One?
Uh, two, please.
Gate Three.
11:05 tonight.
All right.
That's fine.
Hey, I just started.
Oh, excuse me,
I wondered, uh,
has my buddy
been here yet?
A young fellow about six feet
tall, a gray suit and a blond hair?
Yeah, you just
missed him.
Oh. Did he pick up
the tickets?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I think you can
still catch him.
He's probably
still in baggage.
Oh, right. What time does
the bus leave tonight?
Gate Three, 11:05.
All right, thanks.
Thanks very much.
Underneath, a handkerchief
linen chemise top.
The new look
of back interest
and the open effect toward the back
of the coat around the décolletage.
Her violet cloak gives the
new heavenly flowered effect.
One eighty-nine.
Who's wearing 189?
I am.
Out you go, honey.
Our next mannequin
is wearing one of the new
slim sheaths in pale,
pale beige linen.
It has a double-breasted
button effect in the front,
the back panel is
slightly contoured,
buttoning just
under the knee.
The perky little white
pique bow under her chin
sets off a large brim
sailor of rough straw.
She has been beautifully
accessorized in tones of pale beige.
Notice her gloves
and slim shoes.
Go.
Over there, honey. The
beige chiffon, number 372.
What time is it?
1:30.
How many more
changes have I got?
Three.
Can't he wait
till 2:00?
That's just it. I told him
to meet me here at 2:00.
Oh, we'll be finished
by then, honey.
You know me,
never off one second.
Aren't you ready yet? Hurry!
Hurry! You're on right away.
This next
lovely little dress,
suitable for
a summer afternoon,
is in the tones of soft,
soft peach and beige.
It has three-quarter
sleeves, a high neck
and a beautifully, softly flowing
skirt of tiers and tiers of chiffon.
Go.
Number 18. Loretta
will help you into it.
Oh, your company is here. They
were asking when you'll finish.
They?
Frankly, honey,
it's none of my business,
but a girl like you? These two
look like unmatched bookends.
Where did they go?
They said to
stay around.
Mrs. Lipton, please
send me in right away.
Well, fast as you can,
skin in number 18.
Our mannequin's dress
is a ball gown of electric
blue starched chiffon.
The gown has the very new look
of high in front, low in the back.
The uneven hem line has been
brought back from the '20s.
Her midriff is wrapped
in electric blue velvet.
Our mannequin is wearing a ball
gown designed by Jean Louis.
The gown is a slender
sheath of mauve sequins,
worn with one of the very
new Capris collared capes
of yards and yards
of multicolored organza.
A beautiful symphony in shades of
mauve and pink and deeper cerise.
Okay.
Yeah.
Let's go.
But didn't you
say $1.30?
Come on, come on!
No, ma'am.
$1.40. It's on the receipt in your hand.
Let's go.
Oh, oh, yes.
Here it is.
My apologies,
young man.
Just head out. I'll tell you where to go.
Last night, you said I
should have met a nurse.
What you just did back there
was pretty effective first aid.
Mrs. Lipton
must be furious.
She runs the show. Meet one
of her favorites, number 18.
$650 worth of sequins.
Mrs. Lipton's never seen what
a.45 can do to a set of sequins.
I want to stop
at a surplus store
and pick up a pair of jeans and
a jacket and some field boots.
It's going to be pretty
cold where we're going.
Yesterday, my biggest problem was
how I was going to break a date
with a fellow I knew
for tonight.
Of course, I could call him up
and tell him I can't make it.
I'm on my way to Wyoming
in a pair of field boots
with a man that's
wanted for murder.
If I left you here,
they'd find you in no time.
Even if they didn't, I'd
still want to go with you.
You're the most
wanted man I know.
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.
We'll be stopping for
breakfast in a few minutes.
It'll be a 30-minute stop. I hope
you all had a good night's rest.
I'm glad
I'm not a man.
Have to face that
every morning.
That's where you're wrong.
You're going to have to face that
every morning of
the rest of your life.
Is that a proposal, sir?
I don't have any real
right to ask you, I guess.
Do you think I'd let
you get away now?
After spending
two of the most
unusual nights
of my life with you?
Hey, haven't I seen
you someplace before?
I was just thinking
the same thing.
Yeah? Got it!
Couple of nights ago,
on Hollywood Boulevard,
Las Palmas, remember?
I asked you for a light.
Oh, yeah, yeah. You were waiting for a bus
and we talked
about the tropics.
Sure,
sure, that's it.
Oh! What're you
doing here?
I was just going to
ask you the same thing.
Oh. I'm on my way up to Butte,
Montana, to see about a job.
I didn't notice you.
You on the same bus?
I guess so.
I didn't see you either.
Hey, you'd better snap it up
if you want some breakfast.
You know, these boys stick right
to schedule. I'll see you, huh?
We'll be in Moose
in a little while now.
You got your driver's
license with you?
Serial number still in the
upper right-hand corner?
When we get off, I want you
to go to Charley's, a garage.
He's got cars
for rent. Rent one.
Where will you be?
There's a church
at the edge of town.
I'll be hanging around
there somewhere.
Just honk the horn.
I'm glad we got rid
of those two characters.
Yeah, what makes
you think we did?
The next stop is
Moose, Wyoming.
We'll be there in
about 10 minutes.
You can get a fine view of the
mountains from this little town.
The Alps of America, that's
what they're known as,
rising vertically 7,000 feet
above the valley floor.
The highest peak
is 13,766 feet.
What do you want?
Does the name Rayburn
do anything for you?
Is it supposed to?
Hey, let's take
a little walk, huh?
Who are you?
Well, my name's Fraser.
Ben Fraser.
So what?
I work with the police.
Oh. Well, what'll
we do now?
Well, we, you know, walk
a little, talk a little.
About what?
You're taking me in?
Well, there's
more to it than that.
Well, you're the doc.
That's funny you
should say that.
You know, I always wanted to be a
doctor, always wanted to help people.
You picked a great
way to do it.
Anyway, now I want
you to help me.
Look, just take me in,
will you? Take me in.
Come on. We'll walk.
I'm tired. More tired
than you know, Mr. Fraser.
To tell you the truth, I'm glad
you finally caught up with me.
Now will you please
just take me in?
You're getting a little monotonous
with that "take me in" routine.
Hey, come on.
You know, I've had my eye
on you for quite some time.
Where's the girl?
She's not in this.
Oh, how do I know?
I just met her.
Well, how do I know that? You
might have known her before.
Well, there's
something I do know.
A man with $350,000
doesn't sit up all night
with a set of watercolors
to meet an agency deadline.
And I watched you
ordering dinner.
Picking out the hamburger
instead of the filet mignon.
It must be kinda tough to
pass up those shrimp cocktails.
What kind of
a cop are you?
I didn't say
I was a cop.
Did you ever hear of
Bankers Blanket Bonds?
No.
Well, look, suppose
you knock off a bank.
The bank don't
lose the money.
They're covered by a bond. My company does.
They've got to pay
back every penny.
Insurance, huh?
When I started
up in Seattle,
the only trail I had was
a sequence of stolen cars.
I finally found the last one.
It had Washington plates.
Back the road
up there a ways.
Then a little further up, the rangers
discovered the body of a doctor.
They claimed a man
by the name of Rayburn,
a commercial artist
from Chicago, killed him.
But I figured
it otherwise.
You figured otherwise?
Mmm-hmm.
How come?
Know what these are?
Ejects.
That's right.
From a.38 automatic.
I picked up these two
up there by the campfire.
Only, the doctor was killed
by a bullet from a 30-30 rifle,
so these don't figure.
Except for one thing.
One of the bandits
up in Seattle
was carrying
a.38 automatic.
Yeah, Red!
And one of the men that
followed you out of Robinson's.
Well, then somebody must
have seen him in Seattle!
You see, when they
stuck up the bank,
he pegged a shot at one of the
tellers who started to go after him.
Well, he missed
the teller,
but I picked
this up in Seattle.
The mark of the firing pin on this one
is the same as the two I
picked up there by the campfire.
All right.
Start talking. I'm ready to
listen. I want to hear everything.
Every move, the whole business,
right from the beginning.
I'm happy to meet
you, Mr. Fraser.
Well, maybe we can put each other
on the starting line now, huh?
The money?
It's out there
somewhere.
Incidentally, what should
I call you? Art or Jim?
Might as well
make it Jim.
I get to like it
better all the time.
Are you going to come with us,
or are we going to go with you?
Well, I'll go with you
under one condition.
We charge off the car
on my expense account.
Okay.
Cutback's just up there.
Do you have a gun?
No. We never use them.
That's why we pay taxes, so the
police can carry them for us.
Let's go.
I remember climbing a fence
like this and crossing a pasture.
Uh-huh.
Look at those prints.
It can't be
anybody but them.
You'd better stay
here, honey.
That's gotta be
the shack over there.
It might be around
here someplace,
I remember I stopped
and rested.
It's all here.
I just counted it.
You're unlucky, fella.
You're not lucky at all.
It's a little soggy, but
it's gonna dry out, I guess.
One more minute,
two maybe at the most...
We'd
have been gone!
Oh, yeah.
You got a bad
sense of timing.
Who are you?
A friend of Vanning's.
Boy, that makes
you unlucky, too.
Well, we'll tie 'em up
and leave 'em here.
Don't get worried. There's
snowplows around here.
There'll be a road
gang in by night.
Well, my way's sure.
And noisy.
You can hear a shot
for 10 miles here.
We'll tie 'em inside.
There's rope there. Come on.
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Hear a shot in the mountains, so what?
It could be some kid
hunting squirrels. Go on in.
Vanning, too.
He ain't paid
his bill yet.
Are you going to do
like I tell you, Red?
Okay. Okay,
one thing at a time.
Put your hands
behind your back.
I worked for a guy one
time. He owned a yacht.
He used to sit out in the stern
of that thing, smoking cigars,
soaking up the sun.
He was a big man,
real big.
As for me, a Pacific.
Say, about a 40-footer.
Diesel power plant on it.
Go around from island to
island, look 'em all over,
and I pick one
out for myself.
All for me.
You wouldn't stay there.
You'd start thinking
about another bank,
another $350,000.
No. Not me,
I wouldn't come back.
What are you going to do with
your end of the money, Red?
I'm going to set up
a scholarship at Harvard.
Okay, sweetheart.
Here she comes.
Put it away, Red.
You still soft
on Vanning?
Come on, finish tying
them up, all of them.
You don't like me,
do you?
No. I've had about all
I can take of you, Red.
After we split up this loot, I
don't have to look at you anymore.
Well, why don't
you like me?
Don't crowd it!
No. I gotta know!
I gotta know real bad!
I'd feel better if you'd
put that rifle down.
Maybe.
How about you put yours away
first, huh? What do you say, Red?
I got a mind to make you
an extra belly button.
The gun, Red.
Come on.
Well, you're
asking for it.
I'm in an
asking position.
You know, we could
stay like this all day.
We could.
Or we can start something, huh? See
how we make out. How'd you like that?
All right, you play it
your way, I'll play it mine.
I'll tell you what
I'll do, Red.
Remember when you shot
the doc, how you counted?
Well, I'm gonna do that now.
I'll count to three. See?
You don't put that away
by the time I get to three,
I'm gonna kill you.
Right?
One... Two...
Okay. Okay, boss.
I'll give you two minutes,
three at the most.
It's not going to take
me that long, friend.
It won't take
the federal agents
any longer than that
to move in here.
Now let me tell
you a funny story!
Hold it, Red!
I could kill you
easy now, couldn't I, Red?
You don't know how many
times I've thought about this.
Every time I thought about it,
I pulled the trigger.
But I'm not going to
unless you move.
Stop!
I'm surprised those federal
men of yours haven't shown up.
I'd be very surprised
if they did.
You see, uh,
I forgot to call 'em.
That bag full of money looks kind
of small out there, doesn't it?
Sitting out there,
all by itself.
It does now.
Let's go keep
it company.
