 Some work needs to be still done 
 on this subtitle but I upload it anyway 
 so others can continue to improve it.

 Enjoy the film! 
 You know, the world's
 climate scientists tell us that...
 ...the highest safe level
 of emissions would be...
 ...around 350 parts permillion
 of carbon dioxide...
 ...and greenhouse gases
 in the atmosphere. We're already at 400.
 They tell us that the sort of safest
 we could hope to do...
 ...without having perilous implications...
 ...as far as drought, famine,
 human conflict, major species extinction...
 ...would be about a 2-degree Celsius
 increase in temperature.
 We're rapidly approaching that,
 and with all the built-in carbon dioxide...
 ...that's already in the atmosphere,
 we're easily going to exceed that.
 So on our watch, we are facing...
 ...the next major extinction of species
 on the earth...
 ...that we haven't seen since the time
 of the dinosaurs disappearing.
 When whole countries go underwater
 because of sea-level rise...
 ...when whole countries find
 that there's so much drought...
 ...that they can't feed theirpopulation...
 ...and as aresult,
 theyneed to desperately...
 ...migrateto another country
 orinvade anothercountry....
Imean, we're gonnahave
 climate wars in the future.
 And what about...?
 What about livestock
 and animal agriculture?
 Well, what about it?Imean-
 Myname's Kip.
 This is me.
Ihad a cliche U.S.American childhood.
 My mom was ateacher.
 My dad was in the military.
 AndIhave one sister.
Iplayed all sports growing up...
 ...butIalways loved
 the outdoors and camping.
 Life was simple,
 not a care in the world.
 And then this guy showed up.
 Like so manyofus...
 ...I saw his film An lnconvenient Truth
 about the impacts ofglobal warming.
 It scared the Emojis out ofme.
 lnAl Gore's film,
 he describes how Earth is in peril.
 Climate change stands to affect
 all life on this planet.
 From monsterstorms, raging wildfires...
 ...record droughts, ice caps melting...
 ...acidification ofthe oceans,
 to entire countries going underwater...
 ...that could all be caused
 by humans' demands on the Earth.
 With scientistswarning
 unlesswe take drastic measures...
 ...to correct ourenvironmental footprint,
 ourtime on this planet maybe limited...
 ...to only 50 moreyears,
Iwanted to do everythingIcouldto help.
Imade up my mind
 right then and there...
 ...to change howIlived
 and to do whateverIpossiblycould...
 ...to find awayforall of us
 to live together...
 ...in balance with the planet,
 sustainably, forever.
Istarted to do all the things
 Al told us to do.
Ibecame an OCE,
 obsessive-compulsive environmentalist.
Iseparated the trash and recycling,
Icomposted...
 ...changedthe light bulbs,
 took short showers...
 ...brushed withthe water off,
 turned offlightswhen leaving...
 ...and rode my bike
 instead of driving everywhere.
 But as theyearswent by,
 it seemed as ifthings were getting worse.
Ihad to wonder, with all the continuing
 ecological crisisfacing the planet...
 ...even ifeverysingle one ofus adopted
 these conservation habits...
 ...was this reallygonna be enough
 to savethe world?
 Itjust seemed that therewas
 something more to the story.
IthoughtIwas doing everythingIcould
 to help the planet.
 But then with one'sfriend's post
 everything changed.
 The post sent me to a report online
 published bythe United Nations...
 ...stating that cows
 produce more greenhouse gases...
 ...than the entire transportation sector.
 This meansthat raising cattle
 produces more greenhouse gases...
 ...than all cars, trucks, trains, boats,
 planes combined.
 Thirteen percent compared
 to 18 percentforlivestock.
 This is because cows produce
 a substantial amount...
 ...ofmethane from theirdigestive process.
 Methane gas from livestock
 is 25to 100 times...
 ...more destructive
 than carbon dioxide from vehicles.
 Here I'd been riding mybike everywhere
 to help reduce emissions.
 But it turns out there's more
 to climate changethanjustfossil fuels.
Idid more research. The U.N.
 along with otheragencies reported...
 ...not only did livestock play
 amajorrole in global warming...
 ...it is alsothe leading cause
 of resource consumption...
 ...and environmental degradation
 destroying the planet today.
 How is it possible
 I wasn't aware ofthis?
 I thought this information would be
 in the environmental community.
 I went tothe nation's largest
 environmental organizations'websites...
 350.org, Greenpeace, Sierra Club...
 ...Climate Reality, Rainforest Action
 Network, Amazon Watch...
 ...and was shocked to see they had
 virtually nothing on animal agriculture.
 What was going on?
 Why would they not have
 this information on there?
 It seemed the main focus for many groups
 was natural gas and oil production...
 ...with fracking being the latest hot issue,
 due to water usage and contamination.
 ...with fracking being the latest hot issue,
 due to water usage and contamination.
 Hydraulic fracturing for natural gas uses
 an incredible amount of water.
 A staggering 100 billion gallons of water
 is used every year in the United States.
 But when I compared this
 with animal agriculture...
 ...raising livestock just in the U.S.
 consumes 34 trillion gallons ofwater.
 And it turns out the methane emissions
 from both industries are nearly equal.
 Living in California, a state plagued
 by drought and water shortages...
 ...wateruse is a major concern
 for many ofus.
 The average Californian uses
 about 1500 gallons per person per day.
 About half of that is related to the
 consumption of meat and dairy products.
 So meat and dairy products
 are incredibly water-intensive...
 ...in part because the animals are using
 very water-intensive grains.
 That's what they eat, and so...
 ...all of the water embedded in the grain
 and that the animal eats...
 ...essentially is considered part...
 ...ofthe virtual waterfootprint
 ofthat product.
 I found out that one quarter-pound
 hamburger requires...
 ...over 660 gallons ofwaterto produce.
 Here I've been taking
 these short showers to save water...
 ...and to find out just eating
 one hamburger is the equivalent...
 ...of showering two entire months.
 So much attention is given
 to lowering home wateruse.
 Yet domestic water use is 5 percent
 of what is consumed in the U.S....
 ...versus 55 percent
 for animal agriculture.
 That's because it takes upwards
 of 2500 gallons of water...
 ...to produce 1 pound of beef.
I went on the government's
 Department of Water Resources...
 ...Save Our Water campaign. It outlines
 behavior changes to conserve water.
 Like using low-flow showerheads,
 efficient toilets...
 ...water-saving appliances,
 and fix leaky faucets and sprinklerheads.
 But nothing about animal agriculture.
 When I added up all
 the government's recommendations...
 ...I was saving 47 gallons aday.
 But still that's not even close
 to the 660 gallons...
 ...of water for just one burger.
I wanted to see if I could talk
 with the government about this.
 Just calling to see
 if we could schedule an interview.
 Yeah, that would be good.
 What does your schedule look like
 this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon?
 -Tomorrow afternoon.
 -Tomorrow afternoon could be good.
 For the urban environment, a lot of
 things can be done. Indoors, you know...
 ...using low-flow showerheads,
 low-flowfaucets...
 ...efficient toilets...
 ...efficient water-using appliances.
 All of those are really good areas
 that can help quite a lot.
 But the biggest watersavings
 is from outdoors.
 We have to be mindful of the way
 we use water.
 We have to use it efficiently,
 protect its quality...
 ...and be good stewards
 of the environment that depend on water.
 And checking the sprinklers.
 A lot of times you get a lot of leaks...
 ...and broken sprinklers
 and things like that that waste water.
 Those are the areas that there is
 a lot of room for conservation.
 It kept on coming up a lot,
 was animal agriculture.
 Can you comment on that at all,
 about how much that plays a role...
 ...in water consumption and pollution?
 That's-I mean, that's not my area.
 There's one study that found
 that 1 pound of beef...
 ...2500 gallons ofwater.
 -Yeah.
 -Yeah.
 Eggs are 477 gallons ofwater.
 And cheese, almost 900 gallons.
I mean, why isn't it on Save Our Water?
 It's kind of like if you went
 to someone's house...
 ...and my neighbour has a faucet,
 you know, dripping.
 And then you see
 this giant hose turned full-blast...
 ...until 660 gallons of water
 are shooting out into the street...
 ...flooding the entire street.
I think I would say,
 "Hey, you know, turn that off, please."
 Seems like it's a huge thing
 that we could be doing...
 ...by far more than anything else.
 Just, like, if that is really the case.
I think that the waterfootprint...
 ...of animal husbandry is greater
 than other activities.
 There's no ifs, ands or buts about it.
 That would be really powerful.
 Rather than waiting till we're in a drought,
 what do you think about starting now?
 And sayto whoever's in charge
 of SaveOurWater:
 "Hey, let's start encouraging people
 to eat less meat now...
 ...because these studies
 are coming out"?
 -I don't think that'll happen.
 -Why?
 -I don't think that'll happen.
 -Why?
 Because of the way government
 is set up here.
 That's interesting, though.
 Why, though?
 One is water management
 and the other is behavior change.
 Behavior of taking showers...
 ...and not watering your lawn
 and doing all that, that's behavior.
 Yeah.
 Clearly the government did not want
 to talk about this issue.
 Their inability to answer...
 ...along with the organization's silence
 on the topic of animal agriculture...
 ...made it seem
 something more was going on.
I did more investigating
 on the impacts oflivestock...
I did more investigating
 on the impacts oflivestock...
 ...and found out the situation
 was actually worse than I'd thought.
 In 2009, two advisors
 from the World Bank released...
 ...an analysis on human-induced
 greenhouse gases...
 ...finding that animal agriculture
 was responsible not for 18 percent...
 ...as the U.N. stated, but was actually
 51 percent of all greenhouse gases.
 Fifty-one percent.
 Yet all we hear about
 is burning fossil fuels.
 This devastating figure is due
 to clear-cutting rainforests for grazing...
 ...respiration, and all the waste
 animals produced.
 This makes animal agriculture
 the number one contributor...
 ...to human-caused climate change.
 But not only that,I found out
 raising animals for food consumes...
 ...a third o fall the planet's freshwater...
 ...occupies up to 45 percent
 of the Earth's land...
 ...is responsible for up to 91 percent
 of Amazon destruction...
 ...is a leading cause
 of species extinction...
 ...ocean "dead zones"...
 ...and habitat destruction.
 Yet the world's largest
 environmental groups...
 ...that are supposed to be saving
 our world didn't mention this anywhere.
I had to speak with them to find out why
 they weren't addressing this issue.
I sent off dozens of e-mails,
 made call after call...
 ...spent hours on hold.
 Days became weeks,
 weeks became months...
 ...and for some reason,
 no one wanted to talk to me about this.
 So bizarre.
I supported these organizations
 for so long and now was met with silence.
I was, however, able to connect
 with a handful of environmental authors...
 ...and advocates that were willing
 to address this issue.
I took my old, trusty van "Super Blue"
 out of retirement and hit the road.
 So my calculations are...
 ...that without using any gas or oil or fuel
 ever again from this day forward...
 ...that we would still exceed
 our maximum carbon-equivalent...
 ...greenhouse gas emissions,
 the 565 gigatons, by the year 2030...
 ...without the electricity sector
 or energy sector even factored...
 ...in the equation,
 all simply by raising and eating livestock.
 You reduce methane emissions,
 the level in the atmosphere goes down...
 ...fairly quickly, within decades,
 as opposed to CO2...
 ...if you reduce the emissions
 to the atmosphere...
 ...you don't see a signal
 in the atmosphere for 100 years or so.
 The single largest contributor to every
 environmental ill known to humankind...
 Cutting down the forest
 to graze animals...
 ...and to grow soybeans,
 genetically-engineered soybeans...
 ...to feed to the cows and pigs
 and chickens and factory-farmed fish.
 Ninety-one percent of the loss of rainforest
 in the Amazon area thus far to date...
 ...91 percent that's been destroyed
 is due to raising livestock.
 The lead cause of environmental
 destruction is animal agriculture.
 I just couldn't understand why the world's
 largest environmental organizations...
 ...weren't addressing this when their entire
 mission is to protect the environment.
 That's the thing, too, is they say:
 "Use less coal, ride your bike."
 What about "eat less meat"?
I think they focus-grouped it
 and it's a political loser.
 Yeah, because they're membership
 organizations, you know, a lot of them.
 They're looking to maximize the number
 of people making contributions.
 And ifthey get identified
 as being anti-meat...
 ...or challenging people
 on their everyday habits...
 ...something that's so dear to people,
 that it will hurt with their fundraising.
 They do not want to address
 the primary driving cause...
 ...of environmental devastation,
 which is animal agriculture...
 ...because they're businesses.
 And they want to make sure that
 they have a reliable source of funding.
I was invited to a meeting with Al Gore
 some years ago...
 ...made these methane arguments, and
 he pushed back. That's just his argument.
 "It's hard enough to get people
 to think about CO2. Don't confuse them."
 The problem with a lot of organizations
 that are focused and have a laser focus...
 ...don't go off message
 because they don't wanna piss off...
 ...another whole group of people
 that will make their lives difficult.
 Major environmental organizations
 don't tell you to do much...
 ...besides live your life
 the way you've been living it...
 ...but change a light bulb
 from time to time...
 ...drive less, use less plastic,
 recycle more.
 It's better for their fundraising
 and better for their profile...
 ...to create a victim-and-perpetrator
 sort of plotline.
 It's like when we talk about the fact that
 we have a dysfunctional family...
 ...and the father's an alcoholic,
 that's the one thing no one talks about.
 Everybody goes around that,
 and yet it's the one thing...
 ...that's causing the devastation
 in the relationships in the family...
 ...because no one wants to talk about it.
 How could these organizations
 not know?
 The issue is right in front of them.
 It's unmistakable at this point.
 And just like these organizations,
 they're falling over themselves...
 ...to show the general public
 that climate change is human-caused.
 And in doing so, they completely fail
 to see what's right in front ofthem...
 ...that animal agriculture,
 raising and killing animals for food...
 ...is really what's killing the planet.
 That was it. No more e-mails,
 no more phone calls. I had enough.
I realized if I wanted answers,
 I'd have to go...
 ...to these organizations'
 headquarters in person.
 -Hi, how's it going?
 -Good.
 We're doing a full-length
 feature documentary...
 ...and it's on sustainability
 and how animal agriculture plays a role.
 And we're seeing if we could
 talk to David Barre.
 -Barre? Okay.
 -Yeah.
 -Do you have an appointment with him?
 -We've been trying for almost two months.
 We haven't even had
 one receptive e-mail or anything.
 -Seeing if we could just set something up.
 -Sure, let me--So let me just....
 They sent out their PR person instead.
 She refused to be filmed and told us
 to turn off the camera...
 ...but promised someone
 from their Rainforest, Ocean...
 ...and Climate Change Departments
 would all speak with us, finally.
 Next stop was to give
 Sierra Club a visit.
 They were a bit more receptive
 to me showing up at their doorstep.
 Hey, how's it going?
 With the climate change,
 what's the leading cause ofthat?
 Well, it's basically burning
 too many fossil fuels.
 You know, so coal, natural gas, oil.
 Tarsands, oil shale.
 All these new exotic fuels
 that are kind of hybrids between them.
 But that's basically what
 is loading up the atmosphere...
 ...so we have this greenhouse effect
 where the heat is getting trapped...
 ...and the temperatures are soaring...
 ...at a rate that has never existed
 in the history ofthe Earth.
 And what about--?
 What about livestock
 and animal agriculture?
 Well, what about it? I mean....
 ...but I'm afraid we're not going
 to be able to help this time.
 Thanks again,
 and we wish you the best of luck."
 Greenpeace's response reminded me
 of the statistic...
 Greenpeace's response reminded me
 of the statistic...
 ...that 116,000 pounds
 of farm animal excrement...
 ...is produced every second
 in the United States alone.
 That is enough waste per year to cover
 every squarefoot of San Francisco...
 ...NewYork City, Tokyo, Paris...
 ...New Delhi, Berlin,
 Hong Kong, London...
 ...Rio DeJaneiro, Delaware, Bali,
 Costa Rica, and Denmark combined.
 Livestock operations on land
 has caused, orcreated...
 ...morethan 500
 nitrogen-flooded dead zones...
 ...around the world in our oceans.
 Comprise more than 95,000 square miles
 ofareas completelydevoid of life.
 So anymeaningful discussion
 about the state ofour oceans...
 ...has to always begin
 byfrank discussions...
 ...about land-based animal agriculture...
 ...which is notwhat
 our conservation groups-
 Oceana being the largest one
 inthe world right now, the most influential.
 As well as others. That's notwhat is
 at the apex oftheir discussions.
Iwent on myfavorite ocean-protection
 organization's website...
 ...Surfrider Foundation,
 to see whatthey're doing aboutthis.
 MostlywhatIfound were campaigns
 about plastic bags and trash...
 ...but nothing about animal agriculture.
 What isthe numberone coastal water
 quality-issue polluter?
 Like-?Yeah,Imean, a lot ofit-
 It's actually-
 We call it, like, the "toxic cocktail."
 Because it really is
 this sort ofdiffuse source.
 So it's, you know, heavy metal from tires
 and brakes and cars, heavymetals.
 It isthese herbicides and pesticides.
 It's reallyjust kind ofpicking up
 everythingwe leave on the ground...
 ...and collecting it together
 and pushing it out into the ocean.
 So it's hardto actuallytarget,
 like, one thing.
 When we're doing ourresearch
 onthis particularone, and runoff...
 ...just kind of increasingly as we're
 interviewing more and more people...
 ...it keeps coming up,
 animal agriculture, as being--
 And we read animal agriculture
 as being the numberonewaterpolluter...
 ...considerably by morethan any other--
 Yeah, that's interesting.Iguess it depends
 on the regions thatyoufocus on.
 Like the urban areas, like where we are
 here in Southern California...
 ...we don't see that, becausethere's
 not a lot of agricultural farms...
 ...but ifyou look inthe mid-Atlantic...
 ...Maryland, Virginia,
 North Carolina, that region...
 ...I knowthere's a lot ofpoultryfarms
 and a lot ofhog farms...
 ...and it's a huge waste issue.
Iwas surprised that not only did
 theynotfocus on farm runoff...
 ...butthey also didn't mention
 any campaigns...
 ...about how our oceans
 are in near-collapse.
 The U.N. reported thatthree-quarters
 ofthe world'sfisheries...
 ...are overexploited, fully exploited,
 or significantly depleted...
 ...dueto overfishing.
 Oceans are undersiege like neverbefore.
 Marine environments are in trouble.
 lfwe don't wake up
 and do something about it...
 ...we'll see fishless oceans
 bytheyear2048.
 That'sthe prediction from scientists.
 When people look atfishing,
 sometimesthey only look atthe animals...
 ...who are actually consumed byhumans,
 so we don't necessarilylook...
 ...at all the animals
 who are caught inthe drift nets...
 ...all the otheranimals who are killed
 in the industry. And when you look at--
 Even the shrimping industryhas done
 a lot to devastate the planet as well...
 ...interms ofbreaking down
 natural barriers...
 ...thatwe have to protect them,
 the islands.
 We're at over28 billion animals
 were pulled out ofthe ocean last year.
 They're never given achance to recover.
 Theydon't multiplyquickly.
 They don't come back.
 We're not giving them an opportunity.
 The oceans are in complete collapse.
 The largefish species
 are nearing extinction.
 Thewayfishing is donetoday,
 to feed the demand...
 ...for90 million tons offish,
 is primarilythrough massive fish nets.
 Forevery single pound offish caught,
 there is up to 5 pounds...
 ...ofuntargeted speciestrapped.
 Such as dolphins, whales, seaturtles
 and sharks, known as bi-kill.
 lfwe're to imagine
 this same practice happening...
 ...on theAfrican savannah,
 targeting gazelle...
 ...but in the process scooping up
 every single lion...
 ...giraffe, ostrich and elephant...
 ...nobodywould stand for it.
 Yetthis iswhat is happening
 in ouroceans everysingle day.
 Between 40 and 50 million sharks
 each year are killed...
 ...in fishing lines
 andfishing nets as bi-kill.
 Then theirfins might be cut off,
 ornot cut off...
 ...butthey're caught initially as bi-kill,
 and it'sfrom fishing.
 It's from fishing in a sustainable manner,
 in many cases...
 ...forfish that are labeled "sustainable"
 by, forinstance, Oceana...
 ...and the sustainable-certified
 organizations.
 So mythought is, whywould we want
 to stop at banning shark-fin soup...
 ...ifyou're concerned about sharks?
 Which all these organizations are,
 and most ofthe public at large is now.
 lfwe really are concerned about sharks,
 we would banfishing.
Iwent onthe world's largest
 ocean-conservation group's website...
 ...Oceana, to see whatthey're
 doing aboutthis.
 On theirsite, along with a TED Talk
 by CEOAndy Sharpless...
 ...I was astounded to read
 they actually recommend...
 ...that one ofthe bestways to help fish
 is to eat fish.
 With theworld's fish population
 in near-collapse...
 ...this seems like saying the bestway
 to help endangered pandas...
 ...isto eat pandas.
Icouldn't understand
 how Oceana could say...
 ...we could remove closeto
 100 million tons offish peryear...
 ...and that could somehow be sustainable
 and good forouroceans.
 Many ofthe species that are
 nearing extinction have done so...
 ...been ravaged and become
 nearlyextinct, in a decliningfashion...
 ...and haven't recovered
 on thewatch ofOceana...
 ...and on the watch
 ofMarine Stewardship Council...
 ...and very much onthe watch of Monterey
 BayAquarium Seafood Watch.
Imention in a lecture, they're aptly named,
 because that's whatthey're doing.
 They're sort ofwatching this happen
 instead of aggressivelyhalting it.
 According to the United Nations
 Food andAgriculture Organization...
 ...roughlythree-quarters ofall fisheries
 are eitherfullyexploited oroverexploited.
 So there's really not awhole lot
 offish stocks outthere...
 ...thatyou might considerat
 healthylevels forthe ecosystem.
 WatchingAndy's TED Talk
 aboutfeeding the world...
 ...in 1988, fish catch, as you mention,
 peaked at 85 milliontons.
 How is it possiblethatwe can sustainably
 catch 100 million tons by 2050...
 ...regardless ifit's in afarm
 orifit's in the ocean?
 lfforevery pound offish
 you're taking out...
 ...you're essentiallytaking out
 5 pounds ofwild fish...
 ...no matterwhetherit's a pond
 or it's in the ocean...
 ...how can that be sustainable?
 The ultimate question, right...
 ...is thatthere is atremendous amount
 ofnatural production...
 ...that is, you know, basically
 coming out ofthe oceans all the time.
 So we have major-A massive amount of
 upwelling from our ocean conveyer belt...
 ...that's bringing up ancient,
 thousand-year-old nutrients...
 ...and our ecosystems
 areturning that into fish.
 Yes, they're eating each other
 and you're losing...
 ...some ofthat production
 every step up in thefood chain...
 ...butyou get more everyyear.
 You can fish and take some out,
 and nextyeartherewill be more.
 And ifwe do that right, without ultimately
 hittingthe fundamental driver...
 ...it's sort oflike living off
 the interest, right?
 As long as you don't
 bring yourprincipal down, right...
 ...ifyou invest in something, as long as
 you don't hit into that principal...
 ...your principal remains high, you could
 potentially live offthe interestforever.
 That's the basic ideawith fish.
 With ourpopulation right now,
 what we're doing...
 ...ifit's 75-percent depleted,
 the fish is now depleted--
 And, you know, it's a good
 analogywith money.
 --we're not living offour interest,
 we're in extreme debt.
 And ifourpopulation,
 who'strying to live as afamily...
 ...on the same amount ofmoney,
 and it's increasing 35 percent...
 -...to 9 billion people...
 -Right.
 ...isn't itjust,
 "Hey, we gottastop spending money"?
 -Yeah.
 -"Stop eatingfish."
 Well, ifyou could bring
 the principal back.
 Fishing ofanytype is depleting
 not onlythe species...
 ...but you get intothis serial depletion
 where one fish specieswill be minimized...
 ...and the fishing industryforthatfishery
 will move onto the next species.
 It's called serial depletion.
 It's aptlynamed.
 In the process, the fish are being lost.
 Not onlythe species is being lost,
 butthe next in line is being lost.
 Andthen the mechanism
 is still extremely destructive.
 So they're losingthe fish species,
 but it needs to be kept in mind...
 ...they're also destroying habitat.
 They came up withthisterm
 "sustainablefishing"...
 ...to make usfeel good
 about eating fish...
 ...and continuing to takefish
 out ofthe oceans...
 ...when, in fact,
 it's Sea Shepherd's position...
 ...thatthere is no such thing
 as sustainable fishing.
 Fishing is not a sustainable protein source
 forthe feeding ofthe planet.
 Forthe people on the planet,
 it'sjust not.
 People don'twanna hear it. That makes
 them feel like they have to take action...
 ...stop doing something,
 and a lot ofpeople don't wantto.
 Theydon't put it outthere, because it's
 uncomfortable to tell peoplewhat to do.
 Butwe're at apoint
 wherewe all have to be cognizant.
 And we haveto realize
 and take an action.
 Ourfounder,
 CaptainWatson, likes to say:
 "lfthe oceans die, we die."
 That's not atagline. That'sthe truth.
 Perhaps the only other ecosystem
 that is being destroyed...
 ...at such a rapid rate
 are theworld's rainforests.
 Ourglobal rainforests are
 essentiallythe planet's lungs.
 Theybreathe in CO2
 and exhale oxygen.
 An acre ofrainforest is cleared
 every second.
 And the leading cause is to graze animals
 and growtheirfeed crops.
 That is essentiallyan entirefootball field
 cleared every single second.
 And it is estimated that every day...
 ...closeto 100 plant, animal,
 and insect species are lost...
 ...due to rainforest destruction.
 What is the absolute leading cause
 ofrainforest destruction?
 Human intervention into rainforests
 is the leading cause.
 And so it's eitherforlogging
 orit's for agribusiness.
 That's when you're looking at
 the top global drivers...
 ...it will vary a bit bythe rainforest
 that you'retalking about...
 ...butthe waythatwe're choosing
 to use these natural resources...
 ...on alarge industrial scale
 is the leading driver.
 WhenIwent on R.A.N.'s website...
 ...I couldn't believe
Ididn't see anything about cattle.
 ButIdid seethey had a large
 campaign against palm oil.
 Palm oil plantations causetremendous
 deforestation in the lndonesian rainforest.
 It is estimated that palm oil is responsible
 for26 million acres being cleared...
 ...though compared to livestock
 and theirfeed crops...
 ...theywere responsible for136 million
 acres of rainforest lost to date.
 But on theirwebsite,Iwas shocked
 to find cattlewas not included...
 ...as one oftheirfourmain key issues.
 lnsteadtheyfocused on palm,
 pulp and paper, coal, and tar sands?
 How could theynot have the leading
 cause ofrainforest destruction?
Ihad to wonder, whyfocus
 onfossil fuels and not cattle?
 ls it more fossil fuels,
 or is it more animal agriculture?
Idon't knowwhywewould do
 a one-or-the-other.
 I'mjustwondering, what more is it?
Idon't necessarily knowwhat it is.
 Could the executive director ofone
 ofthe world's largest...
 ...rainforest protection groups
 honestlynot know what was going on?
 Oreven worse, were they hiding it
 on purpose?And if so, why?

 to see iftheywould say...
 ...whatthe leading cause
 ofrainforest destructiontruly is.
 The most biologicallyand culturally
 diverse place on the planet...
 ...is undermassive attack right now.
 TheAmazon rainforest itselfcould be
 gone in the matter ofthe next 10years.
 What is the leading cause
 ofrainforest destruction?
 The leading cause
 ofrainforest destruction...
 ...I would say--
 Well,justto put it inthe context
 ofwhatAmazon Watch works on...
 ...there's many, many drivers
 ofdeforestation, as we call them...
 ...many different reasons and ways
 that rainforests are destroyed.
 The main-The ones that cause
 the most damage...
 ...and arethe mostwidespread
 are mega projects...
 ...such as oil and gas pipelines,
 such as mining projects...
 ...such as mega dam projects.
 We're nottalking about....
Ifelt likeIwas going in circles
 with these groups.
 As ifIwere stuck in some strange
 "cowspiracy" twilight zone...
 ...where no one couldtalk about cows.
Icouldn't believe
 these organizationsjustwouldn't say...
 ...whatthe leading cause
 ofrainforest destructiontruly is.
Ihad to ask one more time.
 It's hardto saywhat is the leading cause
 ofdeforestation oftheAmazon...
 ...becausethey're all destructive,
 oil and gas, mining, dams, agriculture.
 But in terms ofland use,
 in terms ofthe amount ofland...
 ...that is destroyed by....
 When wetalk about in comparison, all
 those different causes ofdeforestation...
 ...what is causing the mosttrees
 to fall, forexample...
 ...I think itwould definitely
 be agriculture.
 Unfortunately one ofthe biggest
 causes ofdeforestation...
 ...definitely inthe BrazilianAmazon,
 is agribusiness.
 Cattle grazing
 and soy production, in particular.
 This is reallywhat's going on.
 Whydo youthink that's...?
 Like, no one at Greenpeace,
 orno one's really saying thewhole story.
 Thewhole story about
 the main cause ofdeforestation?
 Yeah.
 You've brought up
 some really good points about...
 ...why isn't anybody
 doing anything aboutthis?
 AndIthink in Brazil, in particular,
 when we look at, you know...
 ...what happened
 afterthe Forest Codewas passed...
 ...and people who were standing up
 againstthe lobbyists and the interests...
 ...the special interests, the cattle industry,
 the agribusiness industry...
 ...whatwas happening tothem?
 People who were speaking out got killed.
 And ifyou look at, you know,
 Z Carlos, you look at Claudio--
 People who were putting
 themselves outthere...
 ...and saying cattle ranching,
 you know, is destroying theAmazon...
 ...alot ofthose people who really
 putthemselves outthere--
 And look at Dorothy Stang,
 you know, the nun who lived out in Para...
 ...whowas killed.
 A lot ofpeoplewill speak up.A lot
 ofpeoplejust keep theirmouths shut...
 ...because theydon'twanna be
 the next onewith the bulletto their head.
 Sister DorothyStang
 was a U.S.-born nun...
 ...Iiving in the heart
 ofthe Brazilian rainforest.
 Herlife's work
 wasto protecttheAmazon.
 She spoke out openlyagainst
 the destruction ofrainforest...
 ...from cattle ranchingforyears.
 Walking home one night,
 she was brutally gunned down...
 ...at point-blank range by ahired gun
 from the cattle industry.
 AfterGreenpeace's initial denial
 foran interview...
 ...I wrote again,
 begging theyreconsider.
 Greenpeace got back again,
 and said again:
 "I'm afraid we've explored the options
 here interms ofhelping you...
 ...and are not going to be able
 to be involved this time.
 You mentioned
 youwere also speakingto Oceana.
 I'm sure they'll be able to give you
 some great quotes...
 ...about ocean-related issues.
 Thanks again forthinking ofus."
 Unbelievable.
 With Greenpeace unwilling
 to be interviewed...
 ...I had to find a different avenue
 for answers.
 There's something reallyfishy
 going on overthere.
 Fortunatelyl found
 aformer Greenpeace board ofdirector...
 ...who now speaks openly
 aboutthe industry.
 Environmental organizations, like other
 organizations, aren'ttellingyou the truth...
 ...aboutwhatthe world needs
 from us as a species.
 It's so frustrating when the information
 is right beforetheireyes.
 It's documented in peer-reviewed
 papers andjournals.
 It'sthere foreverybodyto see.
 Butthe environmental organizations
 are refusing to act.
 Nowhere do you find in theirpolicies...
 ...and nowhere do youfind
 in the Greenpeace mission...
 ...that diet is important...
 ...that animal agriculture is the problem.
 Theyare refusing,
 like otherenvironmental organizations...
 ...to look at the issue.
 The environmental community isfailing us
 and they're failing ecosystems.
 And it's sofrustrating
 to see them dothis.
 "NRDC, the Earth's best defense."
 All right, so here they actually
 do have afew things...
 ...on animal agriculture.
 The leading cause of environmental
 degradation istoo much pollution...
 ...and too many engines
 churning too fast...
 ...in too many places around the globe.
 Late in 2009, Worldwatch reported...
 ...that livestock causes 51 percent
 ofgreenhouse gas emissions...
 ...and transportation's around 13.
 And on the low end,
 the U.N. was around 18 to 30...
 ...which is more than all transportation
 all put together.
 National- lnternationally?
 -Ornationally?
 -The entire globe.Yeah.
Ithink energy production
 and transportation...
 ...are still major sources, soIthink....
 I'm not gonna comment onthat because
 I'm notfamiliarwiththose numbers.
 So it's--
 Don't quote me on this,
 butthat's cowfarts.
 That's,Ithink, whatthat is.
 It's....
Ithink that's cowfarts.
 Well, that's part ofthe story.
 Methane production from cows
 and livestock's flatulence...
 ...is a major contributor.
 But mostly it is due to deforestation
 and the wastethey produce...
 ...which is 130times more waste
 than the entire human population.
 Virtually all withoutthe benefit
 ofanywaste treatment.
 NRDC absolutely, asIsaid,
 has afood program.
 In fact, wejust-- Everyyearwe do
 the Growing GreenAwards...
 ...and we recognizefood innovators,
 and this lastyear...
 ...one ofthe awardees was
 a sustainable pork producer, actually...
 ...that doesn't use any antibiotics.
 And also the antibiotic use
 that industrial food production...
 ...in the United States uses
 right now is--
 We're giving--The majority
 ofantibiotics in the United States...
 ...are administered to healthy livestock.
Iwantedto visit one
 ofthese sustainablefarms.
Ifound the Markegard Grass-Fed
 beeffarm...
 ...on the lush, misty Californiacoast.
Imet Erik and Doniga Markegard
 and theirfourchildren.
 Lea and Larryare usuallyup at 6
 and out milking the cows...
 ...slopping the hogs.
 All together, we graze about
 4500 acres.
 And this is ourhome ranch.
 And this is 952 acres ofthat.
 On average, it's about one cow,
 ora cow and a calf, perevery 10 acres.
 Wewould produce annually
 roughly 80,000 pounds...
 ...offinished, plate-ready meat.
 We keep about 10 pigs
 in roughly a50-acre area...
 ...and we move them around
 in 10-acre pastures.
 Some people think that pigs are dirty
 and gross, butIreally likethem.
 They have--Theyknow people,
 and they'll befriends and really nice.
 And they could be likeyourbestfriend,
 or could be like a sister.
 See?
 Theyknowyou
 whenyou getto knowthem.
Imean,Ishouldn't be bonding,
 butwe have to have nice pigs.
 Whyshouldn'tyou bond with them?
 Well, because they're gonna
 turn into bacon.
 -These pigs are about 7 months old now.
 -That's it?
 So these bigger ones
 are getting readyto be killed.
 Those two smaller ones there, you know,
 they could grow up afew more months.
Ilove animals.
 That's why I'm in the meat business.
 It's what more ofsocietyneeds to see...
 ...is thatthat packaged piece ofmeat
 is a living animal.
 Living and breathing creaturethat....
 Yeah, it's hard, it's hard,
 but like what Doniga said earlier...
 ...we do it because we love them.
 Withthe land use,
 there's anywhere between....
 With industrial, as low as
 2to 2.5 acres per cow...
 ...all the way up to some, depending-
 It's not as lush asthis. Up to 35 acres.
 Yeah, we have a ranch
 in South Dakotathat's 50 acres.
 -Fiftyacres per--?
 -Yeah, it's about 50 acres. Yeah.
 And why is that?
 Samething, itwasjust farmed
 and robbed of all the nitrogen--
 -The land was abused.
 -lt's also seasonal, right?
 And it's also seasonal.
 ls it possible and is it practical
 forthe whole world to say:
 "Have grass-fed cattle"?
Imean, like, say Brazil,
 where, you know...
 ...supposedly 80 percent ofthe rainforest
 was destroyed forcattle...
 ...what are yourthoughts on that?
 They shouldn't be eating beef.
 lftheirenvironment wasn't
 designed to raise beef...
 -...then theyshouldn't be eating it.
 -Yeah.
 How doyou offset
 the carbonfootprint of livestock?
 We don'tfeel like livestock
 have acarbon footprint.
Ileftthere feeling confused.
 As far as grass-fed beef
 not having a carbon footprint...
 ...it sounded like it could make sense...
 ...untilIadded up the numbers
 on land use and population.
 lfwe'reto use the Markegard model
 of raising animals...
 ...which requires 4500 acres
 producing 80,000 pounds ofmeat...
 ...the averageAmerican eats
 209 pounds ofmeat peryear.
 lfthat was all grass-fed beef,
 only 382 people could be fed on theirland.
 That equatesto 11.7 acres perperson
 times 314 millionAmericans...
 ...which equals 3.7 billion acres
 ofgrazing land.
 Unfortunatelythere are only1.9 billion
 acres in the U.S.' lower48 states.
 Currently nearlyhalfofall U.S. land
 is already dedicated to animal agriculture.
 lfwe're to switchto grass-fed beef...
 ...itwould require clearing
 every square inch ofthe U.S....
 ...up into Canada, all ofCentralAmerica,
 andwell into SouthAmerica.
 And this isjust to feed
 the United States' demand on meat.
 Butthat figure doesn't even
 take into consideration...
 ...that much ofthat land isn't suited
 to graze livestock.
 Wewould have to convert
 all mountain ranges to grassland.
 Clearancient forests
 and national parks to grazing.
 And demolish everycity
 justto make room to graze cows.
 Just like Brazil, the United States isn't
 suited to meetthe demandsfor meat.
 Ittakes 23 months
 fora grass-fed animal to grow...
 ...tothe size and agethat it's slaughtered,
 whereas a grain-fed takes 15 months.
 So that's an additional eight months
 ofwateruse, land use, feed, waste...
 ...and interms ofacarbon footprint,
 that's a huge difference.
 Turns out, dueto land use...
 ...grass-fed beefis more unsustainable
 than evenfactoryfarming.
Ihad to come totermswith the fact
 there was no wayto sustainablyraise...
 ...enough animals to feed
 the world's current demand on meat...
 ...and had my doubts on dairy as well.
 ButIdid wantto talk
 with apremierorganic dairycompany...
 ...to see iftheybelieved theirproductwas
 sustainable forthe world's population.
 It requires a lot ofinputs
 to produce milk.
 The feed, the water, the land. It does.
 And it may not be practical to expectthat
 there can be enough dairyproduction...
 ...produced in asustainable way
 to feed the entireworld.
 ljust don'tthink that
 that's necessarily agiven.
Ithink it's maybe too muchto expect...
 ...that the world can be fed with dairy
 in a sustainable way.
Idon't knowthe answer,
 but common sense would say...
 ...that's along shot.
Iwas shocked
 to hearsuch an honest answer.
 lfthis is whatthe dairy CEOwould say,
Iwondered whatthefarmerwould claim.
 Based on their marketing it seemed
 theirfarms were an oasisfor cows.
 Itwas notwhatIexpected.
 Typically a cowwill eat
 140to 150 pounds offeed aday.
 -A hundred and forty--?
 -Fortyto 50 pounds offeed every day.
 And then she's also gonna drink
 between 30 and 40 gallons ofwater.
 Oh, my Lord.
 Probably go through
 about 20 tons perweek.
 -Twentytons ofgrain perweek.
 -Twentytons ofgrain. For...?
 Primarilyfor ourmilking cows,
 so about 250 cows.
 Yeah, sothe biggest part
 ofsustainabilityto me...
 ...the numberone thing onthe list
 should be profitability.
 So howthe process completelyworks,
 from startto finish...
 ...is the cow needs to have ababy
 in orderto give milk.
 And so she'll have herbaby.
 That baby's gonna stay...
 ...with the motherforat least two days.
 The babies will go off
 to ourcalf-raising facility...
 ...so they have an individual hutch
 thatthey'll be raised in.
 Since we're adairy,
 it's onlythe girl cowsthat give us milk.
 So the boys, on typical dairies,
 they're sold offto beef-raisingfacilities.
 But we do keep approximatelyhalf
 and we raise them fortwo years...
 ...and sell them as organic
 grass-fed beef.
 So all dairy cows eventually go
 to the beefindustry?
 At some point she'll really drop off.
 So you haveto make abusiness decision
 atthat point:
 Areyou gonna keep investing in her
 to give milk...
 ...or areyou gonna sell her offagain
 to anotherdairy, or into the beefindustry?
 There's veryfew places on this planet
 that havethistype of environment.
 Butthe demand on dairy-based protein
 inthe world is only gonnaincrease.
 And there's not enough land
 on the planet...
 ...to do this type ofdairying
 around the world.
 It'sjustthe environment is not
 gonna be thatway. The land's notthere.
 SoIguess on a global scale...
 ...the conclusion would be
 dairy's not sustainable.
 Unlesswe start digging up houses
 and putting pastures back.
 And the onlywayto start digging up houses
 and development is to have less people.
 Butwe only know thatthe population
 is gonna continueto grow.
 So that means more
 commercial dairying, I'm sure.
 Eitherthat orsomehow
 lower demand bythe people?
 Yeah, or some otherproduct's
 gonnatake its place.
 We see there are all sorts
 ofsoy milks and almond milk...
 ...and a lot ofother products
 that are coming out.
 And different blends, you know,
 where you takejuices and proteins.
Ithink you'll see alot more ofthat.
 He was right.
 How could cows' milk be sustainable?
 Forone gallon ofmilk, ittakes upwards
 of1000 gallons ofwaterto produce.
 Doing research
 on grass-fed livestock...
 ...I kept coming across
 the work ofAllan Savory.
 Almost athird ofthe planet's land
 is becoming desert...
 ...with the vast majority
 due to livestock grazing.
 Savoryclaimsthatthe best way
 to reverse this desertification...
 ...isto actually graze more animals.
 This reminded me ofOceana saying
 the best wayto help fish is to eatfish.
 This is the same man...
 ...during the 1950s
 working as a research officer...
 ...forthe Game Department
 ofwhat is nowZimbabwe...
 ...came upwith atheory,
 in spite ofscientific evidence...
 ...that actuallyelephantswere
 the cause ofdesertification there.
 And his solutionwas convincing
 the government to kill 40,000 elephants.
 Yet after 14years of relentless slaughter,
 the conditions only got worse.
 His theorywas wrong.
 The cullingfinally ended...
 ...but not until tens ofthousands
 ofelephants andtheirfamilieswere killed.
 This is not someoneIwould ever
 take ecological advice from.
 Itturns outthe cattle industry
 is havingthe same effect...
 ...on wildlife inthe United States.
 The government has been
 rounding up horses en masse.
 We now have more wild horses and
 burros in government holding facilities--
 Fifty-thousand wild horses and burros.
 --thanwe have free on the range.
 Basicallyyou have ranchers
 who getto graze on ourpublic lands...
 ...for afraction ofthe going rate.
 They're getting this huge tax subsidy.
 It's about one-fifteenth ofthe going rate.
 And the Bureau of Land Management
 hasto say:
 "How muchforage and water
 is onthe land?"
 And thenthey divvy it up.
 They give so muchto the cows,
 so muchto, you know, "wildlife"...
 ...and so much to
 thewild horses and burros.
 And whatwe see isthe lion's share
 ofthe forage and water...
 ...is going to the livestock industry.
 Andthen they scapegoat
 the horses and burros and say:
 "Oh, there aretoo many horses
 and burros. Let's remove them."
Ialwaystell people, wild horses
 and burros arejust one ofthe victims...
 ...ofthe management ofour public lands
 forlivestock...
 ...because we also see
 the predator-killing going on.
 We know wolves are now being targeted
 byranchers, to get rid ofwolves.
 USDA has aircraft, and all they do
 is aerial gunning ofpredators.
 All arancherdoes is call up
 and say, "I've got coyote here."
 They'll come over and shootthe coyote.
 Orthey'll shoot the mountain lion
 orthe bobcat.
 Andthis is all for ranching.
 In Washington State, after cattle
 were found to be attacked...
 ...on public lands
 wheretheywere grazing underpermit...
 ...Washington State decided to
 kill the entire Wedge pack ofwolves.
 And those wolveswere not introduced.
 They had in-migrated from Canada.
 Butthey're no longerthere.
 And it starts atthe local level,
 withthe Bureau of Land Managements...
 ...butthen it goes all the way
 to Congress.
 And we see Congress willingto allow...
 ...this type ofmismanagement
 ofour public lands to continue.
 It is the insistence of,
 and the lobbying power of...
 ...the animal agriculture industry...
 ...that continues to seewolves killed...
 ...continues to see an insistence
 that predators be maintained...
 ...at a low level
 that does not benefit ecosystems.
 I've seen so many pieces ofland, looked
 at so manyenvironmental assessments...
 ...from the
 Bureau of Land Management...
 ...where theysaythe range lands
 are not meeting standards.
 Andthey say, straight-up,
 livestock grazing...
 ...is a cause for
 not meeting range standards.
 And yettheywill continue
 to allow livestock grazing.
 They're at the very core
 ofmaking sure...
 ...that cougars are treed byhounds...
 ...and thatwolfpacks are run down...
 ...and that hunting seasons
 are opened up year-round...
 ...and thattraps are set
 so thattheycan suffer.
 lfanyone cares aboutwild horses
 and wildlife and public lands...
 ...and the environment,
 you can't ignore the livestock--
 The negative impactthat livestock grazing
 is having on ourpublic lands in the West.
 I've added up the costs
 ofanimal food production...
 ...thatthe producers don't
 actuallybearthemselves.
 These arethe hidden costs
 orthe externalized costs...
 ...thatthey impose on society.
 And those are in categories like
 health care, environmental damage...
 ...subsidies, damage to fisheries,
 and even cruelty.
 lfyou take those externalized costs,
 which are about $414 billion...
 ...ifthe meat and dairyindustrieswere
 required to internalize those costs...
 ...ifthey had to bear
 those costs themselves...
 ...the costs ofthe retail prices
 ofmeat and dairywould skyrocket.
 So a$5 carton ofeggswould go to $13.
 A $4 Big Mac would go to $11.
 The problem with these externalized costs
 being imposed on society...
 ...is thatwhetheryou eat meat or not...
 ...whetheryou're an omnivore
 oran herbivore...
 ...you are paying part ofthe costs
 ofsomebody else's consumption.
 Sowhen somebody goes
 into a McDonald's...
 ...and buys a Big Macfor$4...
 ...there's another$7 ofcosts
 that's imposed on society.
 I'm paying that. You're payingthat,
 whetheryou eat meat ornot.
 When you look atwho's benefiting, and
 who lobbiedforthis system ofagriculture...
 ...it's the largestfood producers
 inthe country...
 ...and the largest meat producers.
 And once theybecome so
 large and wealthy...
 ...then theycan dictatethe federal policies
 around producing food...
 ...becausethey have
 so much political power.
 Was this whyAl Gore,
 even during his vice presidency...
 ...neveraddressed the issue
 ofanimal agriculture...
 ...and failed to talk about it
 inAn lnconvenient Truth...
 ...orhis organization,
 The Climate Reality Project?
 Was this truthjusttoo inconvenient
 foreven him?
Ifelt let down bythe man
 who inspired me on this entire path.
IknewIneeded to talk
 to an animal agriculture lobby group...
 ...to see whatthey had to say.
 lfthey could silence the government,
 arethey influencing...
 ...and possibly have connections
 to these environmental groups aswell?
 Animal AgricultureAlliance,
 one ofthe biggest livestock lobbygroups...
 ...has agreed to an interview.
 Greenpeace won't give us an interview...
 ...butAnimalAgricultureAlliance
 has agreed to an interview.
 Now, that....
 Now, that is saying something.
 People hearthe word GMOs,
 andthat's a really scaryterm.
 Agriculture's kind ofstruggled to explain
 whatthat means, but in reality...
 ...whatwe've done is to usetechnology
 to make advancements...
 ...in how we raise crops
 and how we raise animals.
 We're not gonnafeed theworld
 going back to how itwas 100 years ago...
 ...where all the animalswere,
 you know, pasture-fed.
 We didn'tjust move animals inside
 andjust implement...
 ...these large vertically-integrated systems
 because ofsustainability.
 It certainly reduces
 the environmental impact...
 ...while improving animal well-being
 and food safety.
 Soyou're saying that animals like it
 just as much being inside...
 ...say, the chickens and the cows
 like beingjust as much inside...
 ...as pasture grass-fed?
 In alot ofcases, it's been a significant
 improvement in theirwell-being...
 ...just in terms ofthe amount ofcare
 they can get, individualized care.
 Does the meat and dairyindustry
 eversupport...
 ...or donate
 to environmental non-profits?
Idon't knowthatIwould want
 to comment on that.
 Yeah, l....Idon't....
Idon't know.
Idon't know thatwe would know
 whatthey donate to.
 Does meat and dairy industry eversupport
 ordonate to, say, Greenpeace?
 Again,Idon't know
 thatIwouldfeel comfortable....
 Hey, sorrywe didn't
 get back toyou earlier.
Ihave some bad news.
 We are no longerable
 to fund yourfilm project.
 We had a meeting and due to the growing
 controversial subject matter...
 ...we have some concerns
 and have to pull out.
 Whywas this subject so controversial?
 The first personIcould think to speak with
 was Howard Lyman...
 ...who had been sued by cattlemen
 forsimply speakingthe truth...
 ...about animal agriculture
 on The Oprah Winfrey Show.
Iwas born on the largest dairyfarm
 inthe state of Montanain 1938.
 Grew up my entire life
 on a livestock farm.
 Grew up my entire life
 on a livestock farm.
 Went to Montana State University,
 got adegree inAgriculture.
 Came back and started
 amega agriculture endeavor...
 ...whereIhad 10,000 acres ofcrop...
 ...7000 head of cattle...
 ...and about 30 employees.
 SoIspent45 years ofmy life
 in animal agriculture.
 And so I've been there, donethat.
 WhenIwas on The Oprah Show,
 we had the food disparagement law.
 Now, thefood disparagement law,
 in my opinion, was unconstitutional...
 ...but what it basically said,
 that itwas againstthe law...
 ...to say something you knew to be false
 about a perishable commodity.
Ididn't say anything on The Oprah Show
Ithoughtto be false.
Iwentthere and told the truth.
 Now, ittook five years
 and hundreds ofthousands ofdollars...
 ...to end up extricating myself...
 ...from the suitsfrom the cattle industry.
 But if I wasto go
 on The Oprah Show today...
 ...sayexactlythe same thingtoday
 thatIsaid back then...
 ...I would be guilty.
 Andfor me, whentheyweretalking
 aboutthe food disparagement law...
 ...itwasthe fact ofwhether
Itold thetruth ornot.
 You can go today and tell the truth...
 ...and youwill be guilty...
 ...because ifyou cause a disruption...
 ...in the profits ofthe animal industry...
 ...you're guiltyunderthe PatriotAct.
 Do you thinkthere should be any concern
 ofus makingthis documentary?
 Of course.
 lfyou don't realize right now...
 ...thatyou're putting yourneck
 onthe chopping block...
 ...you know, you bettertake that camera
 and throw it away.
 Animal agriculture is one of
 the most powerful industries on the planet.
Ithink most people in this country
 are aware ofthe influence...
 ...ofmoneyand industry on politics,
 and we really see that clearlyon display...
 ...with this industry in particular.
 Most would be shocked to learnthat
 animal rights and environmental activists...
 ...are the numberone domestic terrorism
 threat according to the FBl.
 -And whyis that?
 -lt's difficultto answer...
 ...whythese groups are at the top
 ofthe FBI's priorities.
Ithink a big part ofit isthat they...
 ...more than really
 any other social movements today...
 ...are directlythreatening
 corporate profits.
 You know, whenwe tryto find out
 how factoryfarms...
 ...and how animal agriculture
 is pollutingthe environment...
 ...theytryto claim exemptions
 tothat information...
 ...either under national securityterms
 orpublic safety.
 Trademark issues.
 It's abusiness secret.
 All these attempts to keep people
 in the dark...
 ...aboutwhatthey're actuallydoing.
 One ofthe largest industries onthe planet
 withthe biggest environmental impact...
 ...keeping us inthe dark
 about how it's operating.
 Throughthe Freedom oflnformationAct,
 we obtained documents...
 ...from the counter-terrorism unit...
 ...that showthey're
 monitoring my lectures...
 ...mediainterviews, like this one,
 mywebsite, my book.
 Are we at riskfilmingthis
 and showing it?
 You're going up against people
 that have massive legal resources.
Imean, it'sjust overwhelming,
 the amount ofmoney attheirdisposal.
 Andyou have nothing.
 AndIthink thatfearis abig part
 ofthe tactic as well.
 Will was right.Iwas scared.
 WhenIlearned about activists
 being killed in Brazil...
 ...I was disturbed, butIfelt removed.
 But to learn aboutAmerican
 activists andjournalists...
 ...being targeted
 bythe industryand FBl?
 Myfunding being dropped?
Iwas genuinelyworried
 and hit close to home.
 Was this why no one was willing
 to talk aboutthe issue?
Idecided to take precautionary measures
 with all the footageIshot.
Iwas beyond frightened to imagine
 what could possibly happen...
 ...if I pursued this subject anyfurther.
 It seemed the onlydecision to makewas
 to put downthe cameras and walk away.
 ButthenIrealized
 this issue was way bigger...
 ...than any personal concern
Icould ever have formyself.
 Thiswas about all life on Earth
 hanging in the balance ofouractions.
 Nowyou either live forsomething,
 or die fornothing.
 AndIactuallyhad no choice all along.
Idecided to surrender
 nottofearfrom the secret...
 ...but ratherto a cause towardstruth.
Icouldn't be like these
 environmental organizations...
 ...and sit silentlywhilethe planet
 was eaten alive right in front of oureyes.
Ihad to stand up and continue on.
 Some people would saythe problem
 isn't really animal agriculture...
 ...but actuallyhuman overpopulation.
 In 1812, there were 1 billion
 people onthe planet.
 In 1912, there were 1.5 billion.
 Thenjust 100 years later, our population
 explodedto 7 billion humans.
 This numberis rightlygiven
 a great deal of attention...
 ...but an even more importantfigure
 when determining world population...
 ...isthe world's 70 billion
 farm animals humans raise.
 The human population drinks
 5.2 billion gallons ofwater every day...
 ...and eats 21 billion pounds offood.
 Butjusttheworld's
 1.5 billion cows alone...
 ...drink 45 billion gallons
 ofwaterevery day...
 ...and eat 135 billion pounds offood.
 This isn't so much
 a human population issue.
 It's ahuman-eating-animals
 population issue.
 Environmental organizations
 not addressing this...
 ...is like health organizationstrying
 to stop lung cancer...
 ...without addressing cigarette smoking.
 But instead ofsecondhand smoking,
 it's secondhand eating...
 ...which affects the entire planet.
 We're growing enough food right now
 to feed between 12 and 15 billion people.
 We only have 7 billion people.
 We have roughly a billion people
 starving everysingle day.
 Worldwide, 50 percent ofthe grain
 and legumes thatwe're growing...
 ...we're feeding to animals.
 So they're eating huge amounts
 of grain and legumes.
 In the United States, it's more like closer
 to 70, 80, depending on which grain it is.
 About 90 percent ofthe soybeans.
 Eighty-two percent of starving children
 live in countries...
 ...where food is fed to animals
 in livestock systems...
 ...that are killed and eaten
 bymore well-offindividuals...
 ...in developed countries
 such as the U.S. and Europe.
 Thefact ofit is thatwe couldfeed...
 ...every human being on the planettoday
 an adequate diet...
 ...ifwe did no more thantake the feed
 that we'refeeding to animals...
 ...and actuallyturn it into
 food forhumans.
 And so somebodytrying
 tojustify GMOs...
 ...that's liketryingto give
 a drowning man a drink ofwater.
 You can produce, on average,
 15 times more protein...
 ...from plant-based sources than
 from meat on anygiven area ofland...
 ...whetherit's--
 Usingthe same type ofland...
 ...whether it's a veryfertile area
 in one area ofthe world...
 ...or it's an areathat's depleted.
 lfwe would reducethe amount ofmeat
 we're eating, and dairyand eggs...
 ...we could allow
 all these mono-cropped fields...
 ...ofgenetically-engineered
 corn and soybeans...
 ...to revert backto forest again,
 to be habitat for animals.
 You know, anytime somebodytells you
 thatwe can't growfood forhumans...
 ...on the land thatwe're growing
 feed foranimals...
 ...this is somebody that-
 Evoking the numberone crop
 out in California.
 The fact of it is if you can grow corn
 to stuff down the throat of an animal...
 ...you can actually grow corn
 and feed it to a human.
 You encourage peopleto eat less meat,
 forthe resources required...
 ...and the toll on the environment.
 -And on the animal.
 -And on the animals.
 Andthe workers in the system.
 It's abrutal system at every level.
 Asthe world population continuesto grow
 to almost 9 billion people...
 ...doyouforesee someday
 thatwe mightjust completely...
 ...haveto stop eating meat altogether?
Idon't knowthatwe'll completelystop.
Ithink thatthe amount
 of meat-eatingwill decline.
 There's no wayto support
 9 ounces per person per day...
 ...which is whatAmericans
 are eating now.
 lfthe Chinese alone decide
 theywanna eat that much--
 Andthey've decided
 theywanna eatthat much.
 --wejust can't--
 We don't have enoughworld...
 ...to produce the grain
 to generate that much meat.
Ithink a plant-based diet
 isthe most sustainable.
 What do you recommend to see
 for9 billion people can eat...
 ...forthe planet
 to not only sustain, but to thrive?
 Would youthrow out a numb--?
 Like an ounce, one ounce?
 -Oh, permeat?
 -And including dairy.
 Yeah,Idon'tthinkIknow enough.
 But, yeah, itwould be onthe order
 ofa couple ounces aweek.
 You know, it's not gonna be
 thewaywe're eating it now.
 We're gorging on meat.
 We're eating huge amounts.
 -Does that include cheese too?
 -Yeah, yeah.
 -Like, two ounces total?
 -Yeah, cheese and milk.
 -Like, two ounces total?
 -Yeah, cheese and milk.
 Only2 ounces aweek
 seem like nothing.
 People could probably raise that
 in theirown backyard.
 Maybe backyard farming
 was a sustainable solution.
Ihave 42 ducks.
Istarted offwith three ducks
 threeyears ago.
 And then those burdened
 into a population.
Ibuya 75-pound bag ofseed...
 ...and that seed bagwill last me,
 right now, abouttwo weeks.
 The ducks nowthatwe're gonnabe
 culling are about 2 years old.
 When you're living with them,
 they get used toyou.
 You know, they're not intimidated
 orwhatever.
 And so they make all their
 vocal sounds, like natural.
 Slow down.
 Easy, easy, easy.
 Okay.
 No, we're gonna keep you.
 Ron, these two gofirst.
 Being smart-wise?
 Compared to a chicken,
 they're probablythe same.
 -That one's nice, see?
 -Yeah, he is.
 Alrighty.
 Okay.
 Rightthere.
 That's gonnabe a little gruesome.
 How could that still be alive?
 How could that still be alive?
 They're not.
 That's nerves.
 A nerve reaction.
 Five years old or something likethat,
Ithink itwas...
 ...the firsttime my dad came out
 and made us watch...
 ...as we did rabbits.
 And we'd raise probably
 a couple dozen rabbits each year.
 And then we would take those rabbits
 and skin them...
 ...and clean them up
 and keepthem forfood.
 As ayoung kid,Iwas kind of....
Idon'twant to say it was hard,
 but itwas kind of, from my memory....
 Because some ofthe rabbits
Ihad named.
 SoIwas kind oflike going....
 But afterdoing it acoupletimes,
 you kind ofjust learned...
 ...it'sjust something that
 hasto be done.
 Notthefingers.
 ljust can't do it.
Idon'tthinkIcould have someone else
 do itforme, if I can't do it.
 lfl can't do it,Idon't want
 someone else doing itforme.
 And then sustainability--
 Forsustainability,
 75 pounds is 2 pounds per-
 So it's a pound perweek perduck.
 Fifty-two weeks, 110....
 So it's 110 pounds offood...
 ...for1 to 1.5 pounds ofmeat.
 So on a sustainability issue,
 it's 100to 1.
 And that grain gets--You know,
 who knowswhere that grain comesfrom?
 But,Imean, when it getsto this point,
 it's not even about sustainability...
 ...itwasjust....
 You know,Idon'tfeel real good inside.
 It was the firsttime I've everseen that.
 So kind of....
 Yeah.
 I'd been so caught up in the destruction
 caused by animal agriculture...
 ...I realized I'd nevertrulydwelled
 on the obvious reality...
 ...that every one ofthese animals
 was killed.
 Itwas always a disconnected,
 abstractfact of eating meat.
 Butwhen it became personal,
 face to face, the storychanged.
Ihad scheduled weeks in advance
 tofilm anotherbackyard slaughter...
 ...ofa chicken
 that stopped producing eggs.
Ididn't know howIwas gonna possibly
 gothrough anotherslaughter.
 SoIdidn't.
 Animal Place is afarm animal sanctuary
 in Northern Californiathatfocuses...
 ...on rescuing animals
 from the animal agriculture industry.
 A lot ofpeople don't realize, meat-breed
 chickens like this guy behind us...
 ...they're generally slaughtered
 at about42 days old.
 Whereas chickens that are bred
 foregg production are killed...
 ...when theirproductivity starts
 to decrease...
 ...when they start laying less eggs.
 And that generally happens
 about 18 monthsto 20 months.
 It doesn't matter ifyou buy caged eggs,
 eggs from cage-freefarms...
 ...orfree-range or pasture-based farms.
 Hi, Carol. It doesn't matter.
 Turns outthere's asuccessful movement
 of sustainable animal-alternative...
 ...food producers
 based right here in California...
 ...funded by big names
 like Bill Gates and Biz Stone.
 When egg-laying hens eat
 all that soy and corn...
 ...you have an energy conversion ratio
 at about 38 to 1...
 ...whereas alternatively
 you can find plants...
 ...you can growthose plants
 and convertthose plants intofood.
 The energy conversion ratio
 forthe plants we're using...
 ...to replace the eggs is about 2to 1,
 compared to 38to 1 for eggs.
 So ourexplicit goal isto have
 the maximum amount ofimpact...
 ...by creatingthis new model that makes
 the global egg industry entirely obsolete.
 We're making Omega products...
 ...proving we make bettertasting food
 that's great foryou...
 ...and ittakes one-twentieth ofthe land
 and resources that dairydo.
 lfyou could havethe fiberstructure,
 satiating bite, protein...
 ...and all the nutritional benefits ofmeat
 without having animal protein itself...
 ...and bydoingthat
 you could address climate change...
 ...the human health epidemics
 thatwe're seeing, animal welfare...
 ...and natural resource conservation,
 wouldyou make the change?
 Butwhat ifpeoplejust ate
 less animal products?
 Like going meatless on Mondays.
 Whenyou go meatless on Monday,
 you essentially contribute...
 ...to climate change, pollution...
 ...depletion ofourplanet's resources
 and yourown health...
 ...then on onlysix days ofthe week,
 instead ofseven.
 You're creating afalsejustification,
 clearly afalsejustification...
 ...forwhat you're doing
 on those othersix days.
 So in otherwords, we really shouldn't
 be resting on ourlaurels...
 ...ofwhat you do right
 only one-seventh ofthe time.
 You can't be an environmentalist
 and eat animal products, period.
 Kidyourselfifyou want, ifyouwant
 to feed your addiction, so be it.
 But don't call yourself
 an environmentalist.
IknewIhad to stop eating
 all animal products.
Iwanted to helpthe planet be sustainable,
 butIneeded to sustain myself.
Ihad doubts about being healthy
 and not eating meat, dairy and eggs.
 AllIknew was the standardAmerican diet
Igrew up on.
 ls it even possible
 to be a healthy vegetarian orvegan?
 ls it possible to be
 ahealthy vegetarian orvegan?
Ibecame veganfor, let's see,
 32 years ago now.
 AndIrun several miles every day.
Igo biking 40, 50 miles
 through the countryside.
Iwork long hours.
Ifeel great. It's nice waking up
 in alight, trim bodyeveryday.
 And so many ofmy vegan
 friends and patients...
 ...arejustthriving since
 theirtransitionto a vegan diet.
 So, yes, and I've seen vegan moms
 go through healthy vegan pregnancies...
 ...and deliverhealthy vegan children...
 ...and raisethem to tall, full-sized,
 intelligent vegan adults.
 And, yes, certainly all the nutrients are
 there in the plant kingdom to dothis...
 ...that is correct.
 Think anyone should be
 consuming dairy?
Ireally don't.
 When youthink about it,
 the purpose ofcows' milk--
Idid most ofmy growing up
 on adairyfarm in Wisconsin.
 The purpose ofcows' milk is
 to turn a 65-pound calf...
 ...into a400-pound cow
 as rapidly as possible.
 Cows' milk is baby-calf growth fluid.
 It'swhatthe stuffis.
 Everything in thatwhite liquid,
 the hormones, the lipids, the proteins...
 ...the sodium,
 the growth factors, the lGF...
 ...every one ofthose is meantto blow
 that calfup to a great big cow...
 ...oritwouldn't be there.
 And whetheryou pour it
 on yourcereal as a liquid...
 ...whetheryou clot it intoyogurt...
 ...whetheryou ferment it into cheese...
 ...whetheryou freeze it into ice cream...
 ...it's baby-calfgrowthfluid.
 Andwomen eat it
 and it stimulates theirtissues...
 ...and giveswomen breast lumps,
 it makes the uterus get big...
 ...and theygetfibroids and they bleed
 and they get hysterectomies...
 ...andthey need mammograms
 and gives guys man boobs.
 This is....
 Cows' milk is the lactation secretions...
 ...ofa large bovine mammal
 whojust had a baby.
 It's for baby calves.
Itell my patients, "Go look in the mirror.
 Do you have big ears, atail,
 are you a baby calf?
 lfyou're not, don't be eating
 baby-calfgrowth fluid."
 In any level,
 there's nothing in it people need.
 In any level,
 there's nothing in it people need.
 Itwas areliefto hearl didn't have
 to eat animal products...
 ...to be healthyand even thrive...
 ...butIstill thoughtyou needed animal
 manure to grow organic agriculture.
 Turns outthere's an entire movement...
 ...with people growingfood
 without any animal inputs.
Ivisited Earthworks Urban Farm
 in Detroit.
 Theywork with and growfood
 forthe low-income community.
 We tendto see ourselves
 as individuals in abubble...
 ...and forgetthat we inhabitthis land
 and this earthwith other creatures.
 So we have to learn how
 to share more,Iguess.
 Jah here is working on his garden.
 You'd be surprised whatyou can do
 with not a lot ofspace.
 About a4-by-8, yeah.
 What's yourgoal this year? How much
 do you think you can maximize?
 -l would pushfor 100 at least.At least.
 -A hundred pounds.
 That's amazing.
 The one full year
 afterthiswas constructed...
 ...we doubled ouryield
 to over 14,000 pounds offood.
 Fourteen-thousand pounds?
 On about how many acres?
 Abouttwo and a half.
 So as muchfood as we produce
 and we grow...
 ...orthe earth helps us grow...
 ...we also have to return
 those nutrients back to the soil.
 We think ofourwork
 as being regenerative.
 Thatwe're putting as much
 life-giving substance in the ground...
 ...as we're taking out.
 So is itjust kind ofhealthierand safer
 to use vegetarian...
 -...or vegetable composting stuff?
 -Yeah, that'swhat we found.
 But also because ittakes lesstime
 and it's a lot easierto manage.
 -A lot easier, yeah.
 -Yeah.
 -And the soiI'sjust as rich?
 -Yeah, absolutely.
 Not only is veganic more compassionate,
 it's also more efficient.
 And in asocietywiththis many
 billions ofpeople...
 ...we need to be as efficient as possible.
 Some people might go back and say
 ifwe embraced this primitive approach...
 ...ofonlywild animals everywhere...
 ...and we go back
 to, like, a hunter-gatherer system...
 ...that sounds great.
 Butthatwas 10 million people
 on the entire continent.
 Maybe alittle bit more, a little bit less,
 no one really knows.
 Today, nowwe have what?
 We have 320 million in the U.S.,
 25 million in Canada...
 ...another100 and so-many-million
 in Mexico.
 So, NorthAmerica is up to almost,
 you know, 450 million people.
 Trying to figure out away
 to bring animal agriculture...
 ...in balance with450 million
 hungry people is impossible.
 This is amazing,Ididn't believe it
 whenIfirst learned it...
 ...but 216,000 more people are born
 to the plant every day.
 Everyday.
 It's extraordinary.
 Butwhat's reallyextraordinary
 is you need, per day...
 ...34,000 new acres offarmable land.
 It's not happening.
 Tofeed a person
 on a vegan dietfor ayear...
 ...requiresjust one-sixth
 ofan acre ofland.
 To feed that same person
 on a vegetarian diet...
 ...that includes eggs and dairy
 requires threetimes as much land.
 To feed an average U.S. citizen's
 high-consumption diet...
 ...ofmeat, dairy and eggs
 requires 18 times as much land.
 This is because you can produce
 37,000 pounds ofvegetables...
 ...on 1.5 acres, but only 375 pounds
 ofmeat on that same plot ofland.
 The comparison doesn't end
 with land use.
 A vegan diet produces halfas much CO2
 as anAmerican omnivore...
 ...uses one-eleventh
 the amount offossil fuels...
 ...one-thirteenth the amount ofwater
 and an eighteenth ofthe amount of land.
 Afteraddingthis all up,IrealizedIhad
 the choice everysingle day...
 ...to save over1100 gallons ofwater,
 45 pounds ofgrain...
 ...30 square feet offorested land,
 the equivalent of20 pounds ofCO2...
 ...and one animaI's life everysingle day.
 lfwe all did go vegan
 and moved awayfrom animal foods...
 ...and toward a plant-based diet,
 whatwould happen?
 lfwe didn't kill all these cows
 and eatthem...
 ...then wewouldn't have
 to breed all these cows...
 ...becausewe're breeding cows
 and chickens and pigs and fish.
 We're breeding them
 overand overagain, relentlessly.
 So ifwe didn't breed them,
 then wewouldn't haveto feedthem.
 Thenwe wouldn't have to devote
 all this land...
 ...to growing grains and legumes
 and so forth to feed to them.
 And sothen the forest could come back.
 Wildlife could come back.
 The oceans would come back.
 The riverswould run clean again.
 The airwould come back.
 Our health would return.
 Renewable energy infrastructure,
 such as solarand wind generators...
 ...to reduce climate change,
 that's a pretty good idea...
 ...but it's projectedto take
 at least 20 years...
 ...and at least, minimally,
 $18 trillion to develop.
 You know, it's importantto realize that
 we don't have that long of atime frame.
 Wejusttalked about how it might be
 afour-yeartime frame...
 ...so we don't have 20 years and we don't
 have $18 trillion to develop these...
 ...so anothersolutionto climate change:
 we could stop eating animals.
 And it could be done today.
 It doesn't have to take 20years...
 ...and it doesn't have to take $18 trillion,
 because it costs nothing.
 Some say, "Fix CO2,
 then worry about methane."
 It'sthe otherway. Do something about
 methane, you'll get aresponse right away.
 The most powerful thing that someone
 can doforthe environment...
 ...no other lifestyle choice has
 afartherreaching...
 ...and more profoundly positive impact
 on the planet and all life on Earth...
 ...than choosingto stop consuming
 animals and live a vegan lifestyle.
 Do you realize
 75 percent ofAmericans...
 ...considerthemselves
 to be environmentalists?
 You don'tthinkwe couldn't solve
 this problem in a heartbeat?
 I'll tell you what, all we would need...
 ...is forthe environmentalists to live
 whatthey profess...
 ...and we'd be on a new course
 in the world.
 We will not succeed
 until we stop animal agriculture.
 And by"succeed,"Imean...
 ...wewill not save ecosystems
 tothe extent necessary...
 ...wewill not have enough food
 forpeople around the planet...
 ...we will not stop global warming...
 ...wewill not stop pollution
 in the dead zones that run off...
 ...all the fields ofcorn and soy
 that are grownto feed livestock...
 ...and we will not stop the hunting
 ofwolves and otherpredators.
 Organic farming is one step in the right
 direction, butwe need to keep walking.
 We need to get beyond organics.
 We need to getto sustainability.
 Whenyoutake the animal out,
 you takethe greenhouse gas issue out...
 ...you take thefood safety
 issues out...
 ...youtake some otherexternalities
 related to food scarcity out.
 But one thingthat's amazing is
Ithink you put ourvalues back in.
 You put values like compassion
 and integrity and kindness...
 ...valuesthat are natural
 to human beings, you put that in...
 ...you build that back
 into the story of ourfood.
 AndIthink as this begins to progress,
Ithink it also helps people to pause...
 ...before theyeatthat egg,
 beforethey eatthat steak...
 ...before theyeatthat chicken nugget...
 ...and askthemselves,
 is that reallywhattheywant?
 Or do theyactuallywant
 something more?
Ihadto come to the full conclusion...
 ...the onlywayto sustainably
 and ethically live on this planet...
 ...with 7 billion otherpeople isto
 live an entirely plant-based vegan diet.
Idecided instead ofeating others,
 to eat for others.
 At first, likethese environmental groups,
Iwas afraid ofwhat it'd mean to change.
 But nowIembrace it.
 All this talk about sustainability sounded
 like our planetwas on life support.
 AndIdon'twant herto simply survive
 orto sustain, butto thrive.
 Life today is not about sustainability.
 It's about "thrive-ability."
 She's given so much to usfor so long,
 itwas time to give back.
 A hundred-and-eight percent
 of everythingwe have.
 Itfelt good. It was an alignment.
 And we seethis movement,
 notjust about providing cheaper...
 ...inexpensivefood that everyone
 can have, but also a spiritual move.
 A move towards understanding
 who we really are...
 ...and howwe can connect
 to each other.
 Do whatyou can do
 as well as you can do it...
 We become part ofa gathering
 momentum of otherpeople.
 It's happening. This is really
 what's happening. This is the new.
 Selflessness is a nice wayto be.
 It has all these benefitsforyourself,
 aswell as the planet and otherpeople.
 So it's abeautiful wayto live.
 Ecologically, itjustfeels better.
 This is about massivelytransforming...
 ...how oursociety eats,
 because it's a necessity.
 It's acting on whatwe know.
 And acting kindly and gently
 on thewhole planet...
 ...andwith otherpeople
 to accomplish the goals of living better.
 We can do it,
 butwe haveto chooseto do it.
 You can changethe world.
