Junction City!
Stay.
Excuse me!
Marshal! It's the Younger Gang.
I just saw them, bold as brass.
- Take it steady, Frank.
- Cole and Bob Younger. No mistake.
Where are they?
At the bank. Four men, right now.
The Younger brothers.
Looks like we got us
a real big fish.
All right, boys, spread the word.
Everyone knows what to do.
Just tell them to hold it
till I give the signal.
All right, gentlemen.
Hold steady.
Now, we can do this the easy way.
Nobody has to die.
Or we can do it the hard way.
The choice is yours.
You.
Open the safe.
I-I-I don't know
the combination.
I hit him.
I shot Lightnin' Jack Kane!
I got him, Clem.
I seen him buck just as I fired.
Plumb in the middle.
I just shot Kane, 'The Fastest Gun' alive!
Well, maybe you hit him too,
but mine was a head shot,
Knocked him forward,
right out of the saddle.
There ain't no maybes.
My shot was plumb in the middle.
It's the Younger brothers!
We got the Younger brothers!
We got one too!
I-I got one!
Set the camera up here.
Let's get that dead body in the front.
They're gonna take a photograph.
I want the Committee right behind it,
and get the town hall in the back.
This is history.
That there is Sam Jorgenson.
Where's the other one?
Where's that Lightnin' Jack?
Ha! We got Kane, Marshal. Me and Pat
here, we filled him full of holes.
Horse took a fright and dragged the body
on down to the river bed, I reckon.
He ain't the fastest gun alive.
Not anymore.
You better go fetch the body.
Yes, sir.
Uh, Marshal?
Marshal Kurtz in the center.
You've gotta be in the
center of the photograph.
Can we have a
statement, Marshal?
Well, I'm not much for speeches.
I leave that to the politicians.
I am just a man who's doing the
job that people elected me to do.
I think today we sent out
a message to all law breakers.
In Junction City,
You will respect the law,
or you will learn to fear it.
Hear, hear!
I guess these boys are
just slow learners.
Three cheers for Marshal Kurtz!
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
All right.
Hold it.
Read that out to me.
Yes, sir.
But you don't need the gun, son.
I ain't the law.
Read it.
"Younger Gang Wiped Out."
Here. That part.
"The only flaw in the trap was the
escape of Lightnin' Jack Kane.
"Although several witnesses swore
he was shot full of holes...
"and ridin' dead in the saddle.
"Kane is of medium height
and build, blond hair,
"with a mean, weathered face...
And has an English accent."
English?
Yes, sir.
I don't speak English.
No?
- I'm a bloody Australian.
- Oh.
How can I send this
to me mates back home...
And tell 'em what a big success I
am here, if it says I'm English?
Bloody newspapers. Never get
anything right, you know?
That's right.
"Marshal Dan Kurtz was
unconcerned, saying,
"'dead or alive,
Kane don't matter.
"'We got Cole Younger.
"'He was the leader
and brains of the gang.
"'Kane was a follower...
"'and just a brainless
no-account.
Without the Younger brothers,
he's nothing.'"
He's nothing?
Without the Younger brothers
I'm nothing?
- That's right.
- Brainless no-account?
That's what it said.
Yes, sir.
We'll see who's brainless.
Hey!
What's all the shootin'
down there?
Shut up that racket down there!
- What's goin' on?
- Call the Sheriff.
That's four bags of salt.
Two sacks of flour.
You got that, boy?
That's four bags of salt.
Two bags of flour.
Now that's on top
of my regular order.
His handwritin' is so messed up, Mr.
Curren. Maybe I can make it out.
It says, "Thank you, sir.
Is that everything?"
That's what I thought it said.
But it's bad written. Real bad.
Get him to load the rest of
my order on the wagon out there,
And you better do
the tallying up yourself.
Bein' he can't write proper, why, uh, we
don't want him doin' no figurin', do we?
Huh?
Put the rest of those goods
on Mr. Curren's wagon!
And no more sass, you hear?
Pay him no heed, Mr. Doyle.
It's a fine Christian thing you've done
takin' on this poor unfortunate boy.
Well, it's been a real
struggle, Mrs. Franks.
See, the boy was poorly raised.
His folks filled his head...
With all kind of fool thoughts that
he was just as good as a normal man.
Course, when they died
of the cholera,
I knew it was my Christian duty
to take him in.
Try to get his mind right.
Bless you.
Good day, Mr. Doyle.
Good day to you. It's real
hot out there today, ma'am.
It surely is.
Ben. Ben.
Now, Josh Cohen
is one of my best cusTomers.
Now, I ain't gonna have you
sassin' him.
That's it! No more notes and no
more writing. You understand?
Now, half the folks around here
can't even read or write!
And it hurts them
that somebody like you can.
It's unnatural!
Now, I took you on when nobody else would.
I deserve some gratitude.
Finish loading and tally up the cash
drawer and take it to the bank.
Now, hold steady, gentlemen.
We can do this the easy way.
No one has to die. Or we
can do it the hard way.
The choice is yours.
Fill it up.
From Abilene.
Whoa!
Shut the door.
Against the wall, hands in the air.
Keep clear of that window.
Fill it up.
Against the wall.
Keep away from the window.
What the hell's this?
- Storekeepers. They're closin' up.
- What?
Stores. They close at 4:00. They do
their banking from 4:00 to 5:00.
Maybe you ought to come back
after 5:00.
You.
You.
Yeah.
Open the safe.
- I said open the safe.
- I can't, sir. I'm just a teller.
Only the manager
knows the combination.
Where's the manager?
Shit.
Over there.
- Away from the window.
- Hey! They're robbing the bank!
Quick! Call the sheriff! Hands down.
Give me that.
You better hope you got a
lot of friends out there.
Hold still, boys.
He's got a hostage.
It's only the dummy.
Hold still, everyone.
Mate. Come on.
Trail 'em, Jed,
but stay well back.
We'll need a few good riflemen
with fresh horses.
And find me someone who can read tracks.
We'll meet at the livery stable.
Go.
One word and you're dead.
- Where'd they go, Jed?
- They went up through that draw.
Should we circle them?
Go straight?
No, follow me. Hyah! Hyah!
Mount up.
When I say "jump," you jump.
No questions, no back talk.
Comprende?
Mount up.
What are you,
part injun or something?
Nah. Injun would've been smart enough
to let me ride right into 'em.
Jack's gotta be here somewhere.
Take some men and search the ridge.
We'll head for the county line.
- Let's go, boys!
- Hyah!
Get down.
You did good.
You kept your mouth shut.
I'm lettin' you go.
You can talk now.
You can't talk?
Turn around.
Face that tree.
Turn back, you're a dead man.
Don't even think about it.
"I'll join your gang."
What gang?
What are you gonna do, anyway?
Walk into a bank
and write them a note?
Dumbest thing I ever heard of.
Take your boots off.
Quick.
I don't want you runnin' back over
there to tell the posse where we are.
Just be glad...
That you're walkin'
back to town...
Instead of lyin' across
the saddle.
Adios.
Hold up, boys.
It don't make no sense.
He's turned the horse loose
and kept the boy.
Maybe he's just running that poor dummy
boy barefoot out of pure meanness.
Stay alert, men,
and shoot on sight.
Shit.
How'd you get...
I'm snake-bit.
I can't be snake-bit.
That's a Navajo snake charm.
Cost me $50.
Yeah.
Suck the poison.
You're gonna have to suck the poison out.
I can't reach it.
What?
Put the gun down?
That's it?
It's just a splinter?
How 'bout it.
See, snake charm works.
I ain't scared of snakes. Okay?
I just don't like 'em.
Nonetheless, you was willin' to
chew on my butt to save my hide.
The fact is, you've been
savin' my hide since we met.
I ain't a man
to take that lightly.
Let's git.
They'd have turned back by now.
A posse will never cross
a county line.
We got some talkin' to do.
Thought you'd given up tobacco.
All right.
Just this once.
How come you can't talk?
Baby. You had a baby.
You're the baby.
Baby can't talk.
You was born dumb,
But not deaf...
Not deaf.
What's your name? What
do people call you?
Ben Doyle.
Ben Doyle.
Meet Lightnin' Jack Kane.
That's, uh,
the Lightnin' Jack Kane.
You, uh...
You probably heard of me.
Outlaw.
You wanna be an outlaw.
Doesn't everybody?
Gonna help me rob a bank?
Well, I could've used some
backup last time, but, uh...
Ah, your ears, your eyes for me.
You think I need your eyes?
What makes you think
I need your eyes?
Just what gave you that notion?
Yeah, well, my eyes
get a little fuzzy up close.
Tryin' to read
and squintin' down a sight.
But I can hit
anything you can point at.
And it'll be dead
before your finger's straight.
See that?
That's an eagle eye.
Got it off a Navajo
medicine man.
Seventy-five dollars.
That's my aimin' eye.
So don't start thinkin' just 'cause
one part of me ain't workin' good...
That I got a weakness.
Yeah. I guess you know better than
me how folks react to weakness.
Anyway, you still think
I need help?
"I can tell a one-dollar bill
from a hundred-dollar bill."
What?
They're all bloody ones!
I knocked off a bank
for fifty bucks.
What?
"I'll never tell anyone."
Ah, you'll never tell anyone!
Of course.
Hey, hey. While you're at it,
Don't go talkin' to no one
about that snake bite either.
Hey? Don't go talkin'
to no one!
I just come out with 'em.
Don't go talkin'.
Don't tell anyone.
Hey, Ben.
I'll probably make up a lot more
funny jokes like that about you.
But if you ride with me,
nobody else will.
Have you ever tried
Arizona chicken?
I mean, Australia's
a colony. You see?
So if you rob a bank back there,
you're wanted all over the country.
But in America, you can rob
banks in five different states.
You still got another 30. Cross
the border and you run free.
No worries.
Yeah.
Democracy is a wonderful thing.
What?
Oh, a gut pain.
Well, pick your outhouse.
Next time you eat buzzard,
only the drumsticks.
Hey! We ain't got
all day. Go anywhere.
Must've been
a powerful bad smeller.
What do you smell, old mate?
Not you, him.
He's mate.
That's his name.
I was gonna call him thunder
at one stage.
You know,
Lightnin' Jack and thunder.
He wouldn't hear of it.
Uh-huh. That's
what he smelled.
Nah. They're just plain folks.
I never shoot plain folks.
Unless they really annoy me.
Mount up.
Sling it.
Make like your mind's gone away.
Smile.
I don't need a gun.
I'm gonna charm these folks
out of a ten-dollar horse.
Five dollars.
Maybe less.
I got a silver tongue.
Howdy, neighbors.
Thirty dollars
for this bag of bones?
Thievin' bastard.
I should've shot him.
Now, relax.
Like I said, democracy.
We're not wanted in this state
till after we rob the bank.
All right, I go in.
I go to the far wall.
Wave the money,
then you come in.
I do the speech. All you gotta do
is draw your gun and cover me.
Ah, unless someone goes
for their gun.
Then you shoot 'em.
Now, hold steady, gentlemen.
Ma'am.
We can do this the easy way.
No one has to die.
Or we can do it the hard way.
The choice is yours.
There's someone robbing the bank!
Get the Sheriff, quick!
"Bank robbery bungled.
"In a display of criminal stupidity,
one of the two would-be robbers...
"managed to shoot himself before the
tellers could even raise their hands.
"His partner panicked
and the two fled in fear...
"as the bank staff laughed
in their faces.
One witness thought one
of the men was Jack Kane."
Jack Kane? What happened
to Lightnin' Jack?
I sweat blood
earnin' that handle,
And some piss-ant reporter
just leaves it out!
I'm writin' them a letter.
"U.S. Marshal Daniel Kurtz
dismissed his claim, saying,
"'every time there's a robbery,
someone identifies Kane.
"'That colorful outlaw
is finished, Kane.
"'He's just a loose end
who will be cut off.
He sure ain't
no Jesse James.'"
What do they mean,
I ain't no Jesse James?
What's so special
about Jesse James?
Sure didn't impress me none.
Do I know Jesse James?
Yeah.
Rode on a few banks a couple of years
back with him and his brother Frank.
Frank's the brains.
Jesse is a pecker head.
Pecker. Down there,
that's your pecker.
Jesse's a pecker head.
"Is he bald?"
Nah, he's not bald.
Just dumb.
Dumb like I was to try and rob a
bank with a greenhorn like you.
We gotta face the facts.
I was born to be an outlaw.
You wasn't.
Go home, kid.
Forget it.
Just one good headline.
Is that too much to ask?
You want bullets?
What do you want them for?
Gonna rob a bank?
By yourself.
Oh, you're gonna join up
with the James boys.
They're gonna learn you
to be an outlaw.
So one day I'll pick up
the newspaper and it'll say,
"jesse James and Ben Doyle
rob bank."
Like they could teach you
things that I couldn't.
Suppose they'll put that
in the paper too, will they?
"Jesse James succeeds
where Jack Kane failed."
Nah.
Uh, Ben.
I was just jestin' you.
Come on.
Those James boys couldn't even
teach you to fart like an outlaw.
Yeah. There'll be
more of 'em.
If they come down for a visit,
just do like I do.
I've spent some friendly time
with the Navajo.
There'll be no trouble
if we follow their rules.
We're just passin' through.
Show no fear.
No disrespect.
Most important...
Oh, shit.
No rules.
They're Comanche.
Just mount up, steady-like.
They ain't gone.
Comanche don't even have
a word for "retreat."
They'll be circling right now.
That means the other three
will come from my side.
Don't shoot.
No matter what.
Just follow me.
Get down, Ben!
Ride low.
Hyah, Hyah!
Try and stay on your horse. I can't
take on the whole bloody tribe.
Why didn't we shoot 'em?
They're Comanche.
We don't know their names.
You don't know nothin'
about injuns, do ya?
You kill a Comanche
and you don't know his name,
His spirit goes into an owl.
And every night that owl
will come around...
Callin' out, "who, who?"
If you can't sing out the right
name, he'll follow you forever.
Bad medicine.
See, I learned that secret
from old red eagle himself.
He was a Comanche.
Sold me this charm.
Keeps grizzly bears away.
Only $30.
Think we got a problem, Dan.
Granville? That's ten days' hard ride
from where he was sighted two days ago.
- This is horseshit.
- No, it's called competition.
That stuff we ran on law and order
and the Younger Gang wipeout...
Got picked up nationwide.
Heck, the mail made you
a national hero, Dan.
So of course our rivals are
rooting for the underdog.
They'll try and turn Kane into
some kind of folk hero outlaw.
Then you'll be just the lawman
who failed to catch him.
So far it's just
this one small paper.
But it could catch on. We'll have
to deflate Mr. Kane, pronto.
How?
I can find the right people
and the proper incentive.
What I need is some financial support
from the law and order association.
Well, I'm sure that
can be arranged.
Junction City and the mail
are behind you 100%...
Governor.
Now see, there's no law
in wayside flats.
Got us a cabin a couple
of miles up the road.
Tomorrow I'll start teachin'
you the outlaw trade.
But now there's something
more important.
The red garter saloon.
♪♪
There's only one reason
this town exists.
Tell me, how long has it been
since you bedded down a woman?
Don't know?
Never?
Never?
You're a full-grown man.
We're outlaws.
Figured on learnin' you
how to rob banks.
Never figured on learnin'
ya at lovemakin'.
Does your pecker work proper?
Whenever a sweet-smellin' gal passes close
by, does it stand up and say howdy?
Good. You do know
where to put it?
So you're just nervous,
right? Hey.
My first time, only time
in my entire life...
I was ever scared shitless.
Yeah, it was...
it was a nerve-janglin' experience...
For a boy of 11 years.
It's as simple
as ridin' a horse.
Start with a walk.
Now move into a canter.
Steady-like.
No trot.
Never trot.
You hold that steady canter...
Till that sweet little
creature starts to moan.
That's your signal.
Giddap.
- Yeah. Ride hard.
Come on. Yes!
You boys got business here?
Now, remember.
Never just jump on a woman.
First, tell her she's got
a pretty dress...
Or soft hair.
In your case,
stroke it a few times.
Then jump on her.

Howdy.
Kane!
Howdy, Jack.
Howdy, Mr. Kane.
- Mr. Kane. Welcome back.
- Thanks, Luke.
What'll it be?
The usual?
Jack! Jack.
Hey. They told me you were badly
wounded, maybe even dead.
Well, the fact is I did stop
enough lead to kill a normal man.
But you know me. I'm as tough
and hard as a nickel steak.
You surely are.
Oh. I want you to meet
my new partner.
Ben Doyle. Ben,
this is the miss Lana Castile.
Prettiest gal in the county.

you could organize...
Oh. Pilar?
Pilar, here's
a perfect match for Ben.
- He don't talk much, and she never stops.
- Hi.
Now, Pilar, darlin', I want you to
take good care of our friend Ben here.
He could surely use
a nice hot bath.
But aside from that,
he's unsoiled.
Well, what a coincidence.
So am I.
What do you say you and me get
acquainted over some bubbly champagne?
Come on.

Darned if you ain't
the quietest man I ever met.
You ain't said more than two or
three words in almost an hour.
Mind you, I am not one to
complain about such things.
Most men'll just interrupt a person
or talk right on over the top of you.
But not you, Sweetie. You
are a rare gentlemen, Ben.
Now, don't you want to say
somethin' sweet about me?
Then go right on ahead, darling.
You can't talk, can you?
Is there any other part of you
that doesn't work proper?
So you mean to say
no matter what...
Different things we find
ourselves gettin' up to...
You couldn't tell nobody,
could you, ever?
Now isn't that a real shame?
New york. We'll go
to new york city.
I reckon people there got culture
comin' out of their ears.
When, Jack?
Oh, one last job.
I need a couple of weeks
to get Ben ready.
I'm glad you got Ben
to watch your back.
There are some things a woman can
tell right off. He's loyal to you.
Yeah. Probably on account
of I saved his life.
He got bit in the leg
by a rattler.
If I hadn't been there
to calm him down...
And suck out the poison,
he was a goner.
Of course we never...
We never mention it.
Men! Well, this time...
We really are gonna go off
and make a fresh start.
I can feel it.
Seems like only yesterday
I promised to take you a...
It's been nine years...
Honey.
A beer, Luke.
Someone lookin' bright and perky
this morning. Let me guess.
Excited about startin' your
schoolin' today, right?
Huh?
Something else put that
silly grin on your face?
Howdy, Ben. What
did you do last night?
Oh, no!
You mean you...
So then I...
Rode hard?
I'd like to hear
a "sorry" from you, boy.
A stupid grin
just don't get it done.
Don't look at him.
This is, uh,
none of my affair, gentlemen.
Hey, mick, you gotta watch this.
That's Comanche Doyle.
- He don't look like no injun.
- He ain't.
They call him Comanche 'cause
after he guns a man down,
He cuts out his tongue.
Got a dozen of 'em
on a string around his neck.
Under his shirt.
Likes to feel it
next to his skin.
- Yeah, I heard about him. Comanche...
- Doyle.
Comanche Doyle.
Yep, dangerous fellow.
I got 50 bucks says
he can drop 'em both...
Without spillin' his beer.
Make it a hundred.
Ahem. Now just hold on there.
No point in gettin' all "het"
up over a little spilt beer.
Heck, I spill more than that
just takin' a drink.
I guess I'm just clumsy.
No offense, Mr. Doyle.
Lucky fella.
I appreciate you not
makin' trouble in my town,
Comanche.
Ya comin'?
That's what you call
"bluff."
We scared the gizzards
out of them boys.
I surely hope your friend
wasn't runnin' from me.
No, ma'am. He'd more likely be runnin'
after a pretty little filly like you.
You can be sure of that. Last night,
he practically begged me to marry him.
But I'm too young for that.
Ah, you gotta love 'im.
No point in practicin' that.
Too slow.
Got a better idea for you.
Take that rig off.
Rode with a fellow once,
name of Bad Eyes McBaine.
Now he really needed eyeglasses.
Couldn't see past his hand.
So, try that on.
Made himself a special piece.
.20 gauge, cut down.
It's a close-up gun.
Come and get close.
Take it easy.
That knot in the wall.
.45 caliber.
.50 caliber special.
Lightning don't strike twice.
Once is enough.
Now, this shotgun...
At six or seven paces...
Blow a man
clean out of his boots.
But at 30 paces...
It'll just make him
real pissed off.
Put it away.
Now, no point pullin' a gun on a man
if you look like a scared rabbit.
You gotta look right through
him like he's nothing.
Think like...
You're a rattlesnake...
And he's just a little mouse.
Mm-hmm.
Me?
Is that how I do it?
No. I just, uh,
I just know I'm good.
Real good.
That tale I was tellin' about you being
Comanche Doyle ain't entirely made up.
Of course, it ain't true about
Comanche cuttin' out a man's tongue.
Ben, I want you to have this.
Fact is,
ain't even an injun charm.
I got it off an old chinaman.
That's a fertility charm.
They ain't tongues.
They're, um, testicles.
You know, balls.
But from now on,
they're tongues, Comanche.
Ah, no need to thank me. Just
get on with your gun practice.
I'll fix us up a bit of grub.
I've heard talk he used to
lay low around these parts.
I figured he'd head here
if he was all shot up.
How shot up don't matter. The
reward stands, alive or dead.
No, I can't recollect
anyone like that.
Hey, Lana, these two lawmen...
Are askin' about an outlaw by the
name of Lightnin' Jack Kane.
Do you know him?
Lawmen? Lawmen are always
fat old grouchy types.
If you two are lawmen,
you can lock me up.
No, ma'am.
We are the law.
Appointed special
U.S. Deputy Marshals.
Do you know Kane?
Oh, I met him once.
That was enough.
He was no outlaw.
Outlaws can be gentlemen.
No, sir,
Mr. Lightnin' Jack Kane...
Was a mean, low-down,
connivin' skunk.
I heard he's dead.
I hope he is.
You boys look, uh, parched.
Sally, why don't you find these
two handsome boys a table...
While I hustle up
something... Wet?
You should be on the stage, gal.
I could swear you meant that.
Yeah, well, that part about Jack bein' a
low-down, mean, connivin' skunk, I meant.
Lana, you be careful.
Them boys are totin' badges.
I guess that makes them legal. But
they got a smell of death on them.
I know. I just want to know why
the sudden interest in Jack.
Open up. Open up!
It's me, Lana.
Jack.
Jack!
I'm awake.
You told me you always
slept buck naked.
Yeah, I do, but, uh, it wouldn't
be decent in front of another man.
Is that what brought you here
in the middle of the night?
Started thinkin' about me
buck naked?
I came here to warn ya.
There's two deputy Marshals
in town tellin' folks...
There's a dead-or-alive
reward on you.
Dead-or-alive reward?
How much reward?
I think they said 200.
Two hundred dollars?
Well, maybe it was 2,000.
What's the difference?
It's dead-or-alive.
What's the difference?
Women.
Two hundred dollars is a fittin'
reward for a two-bit cattle rustler.
Darlin',
I'm Lightnin' Jack Kane.
A bank robber and
a cold-blooded killer.
Yeah, silly me.
I must have panicked.
Maybe they said 5,000.
Five thousand?
Yeah, that sounds more like it.
Saddle up, Ben.
Folks around here will turn in
their kinfolk for less than that.
Five thousand dollars, eh?
Jack, I'm scared.
Ah! The law's been
on my tail for years.
No, this is different.
These are bounty hunters.
And there's more comin'.
Some Marshal up north has been
hiring killers, special deputies.
Dan Kurtz, Junction City.
It's not safe for you
here anymore, Jack.
You can't come back. See, we can't...
you... Nah, nah, it don't matter.
I ain't plannin' to come back.
Not more than once. I'll take
you with me, like I promised.
When?
One last big job.
I'll be back
at the end of the month.
You be ready to run.
You got my word.
I...
I don't suppose you picked up one of
them wanted posters with my name on it?
No.
This is just a small town.
We need a big city bank,
like Junction City.
What?
Rob that bank again? Huh!
I could never go back there.
The whole town is deputized.
Lightning... Never...
Lightning never strikes twice.
You got a point.
That's the last place on earth
anyone would expect me to turn up.
You're starting to think
like an outlaw, kid.
Give a listen. The biggest
cattle sale of the year.
Junction City auction yards,
Friday, the 27th.
That's next Friday.
That bank will be fatter
than the baker's wife.
And you and me
are gonna take it.
Get us another beer, Ben.
Want to do some more thinkin'.
Oh, sorry.
Get us another drink, Comanche.
♪♪
Hey, boy.
Me and my friends were
just wondering about that.
You plannin' on drawing down
on a squirrel or a duck?
That man in the black coat,
That's John T. Coles.
Coles? The gunfighter
from up north?
What's the matter, boy?
You think you can
see a squirrel?
Gentlemen.
This here
is Mr. Comanche Doyle.
He's a bit...
So folks around here
don't pay him no never mind.
He's been doin' a lot of flappin'
off at the mouth, mister.
You buyin' into this?
Or gonna let that big mouth
of yours just go on flappin'?
You're right, sir.
This is none of my business.
My big mouth is...
Shut tight.
I was just about to leave.
Good idea.
Just stick your tail between your
legs and slink outta here...
Like a yellow dog.
Here, try mine.
Get.
Can't take on four guns, kid.
Now, then,
Mr. Comanche.
You got two choices.
Either you pull that squirrel gun
of yours, or I pull it for you.
Maybe stick it up
your squirrel ass.
Yeah, four is hard.
But three... Easy.
I'm so good, I scare myself.
You boys are lucky.
Now, if Comanche
had drawn down on ya...
Ben?
Hold it right there, mister.
You blink an eye,
I'll cut you in half.
- Good night, Matthew.
- Good night, sheriff.
Sheriff, appears there was another drifter
involved, but he skedaddled fast.
Nobody in town ever
seen any of them before.
But one of the boys said he
heard the name Comanche Doyle.
That be you,
Mr. Gunfighter?
Comanche?
Maybe a good pistol-whippin'
will loosen up your tongue.
Leave it be, Bart.
It don't matter none
what he calls hisself.
I'll telegraph his description
around Tomorrow.
My guess is we'll know
who he is by noon.
Anybody that fast with a gun has
got to be wanted for somethin'.
You know, men like you
gotta understand...
The old ways is finished.
You can't outrun the wire.
This is the 19th century.
Check around outside, Bart.
Make sure the boys have
settled down for the night.
It's been a long time, Jack.
At least ten years, Tom. How have you been?
Yeah.
Eh, surviving.
Just surviving.
You know I can't let you just walk away.
Too many witnesses.
By Tomorrow, the county's
gonna know about the shoot-out.
Shit. Ten years ago I'd have
kicked this cell door down...
And rode out of town
with you, but now...
Ah, just do your job, Tom.
We all gotta survive the best way we can.
And don't take it personal.
I didn't put no name
to the description.
It's the best I can do, partner.
Appreciate it.
- All's quiet outside, sheriff.
- Well, you're deputized, Bart.
Just don't get close
to the drifter.
And I'll spell ya about sunup.
Lock 'er up tight.
Evenin', sheriff.
Who's there?
You boys can act the fool
all you want.
I ain't openin' up for nobody.
Go home and sleep it off.
Darn fool.
Got it closed up.
Come on.
Giddap.
Well, lookie here.
No aimin' sights.
You sure got lucky
in that ruckus, boy.
Nah, you got lucky.
Lucky I didn't blow a hole in that
big turd you're using for a head.
On your feet, son of a bitch.
Slowly, boy.
One hand out front,
the other on your head.
Come closer.
Back up.
Now you can bunk down.
No point in me missin' a good
night's sleep over a scum like you.
Hey, deputy!
Fire!
Keys! There.
Hurry up.
Come on.
The cuffs.
The desk.
Fire!
The cuffs.
You got religion, Ben?
I never thought much
on it myself.
Till back there when you
came through the flames.
Thought you was old Satan himself
coming to claim me personal.
I've come to thinkin', Ben.
You got a shortcomin'.
You just ain't partial
to pullin' that trigger...
And blowin'
a man's head off, right?
Hey, don't be ashamed, Ben.
Nobody's perfect.
Even I got one flaw
in my nature.
Never could trust anyone...
Till now.
You being gun-shy don't matter.
Shit, I shoot better...
Than any two men alive anyway.
What counts is,
I trust you, partner.
Trust you like a brother.
And that touches me.
I feel like I should
give you a big hug.
So it's a lucky thing we don't
do that kind of sissy stuff.
Three dollar, now four. Will you bid a
four dollar now? Four, four, now five.
Five dollar ready. Five dollar, now six.
Six dollar now. Seven.
Seven dollar now. Eight, eight, eight
dollar even. Eight dollar, eight dollar...
Cattle sale's
finished at 3:00.
By 5:00, that bank will be
bursting at the seams with cash.
Then we go in
and pay our respects.
Yeah, I know.
That's what's gonna give us
the element of surprise.
I'll show you.
Beg your pardon, sir.
That bank over there,
Is that where those
outlaws were ambushed?
It surely is, sir.
You were right.
Outlaws.
Makes me nervous about
depositing our cash there.
Gentlemen, you are looking at
the safest bank in the state.
Why, every businessman
in town is a member,
And at the first hint
of trouble...
No outlaw in the territory
would even think about it.
Not after the way we
handled that Younger Gang.
You were part of that?
I was the first to spot 'em.
I guess I... I just have
an eye for trouble.
Yeah.
That's definitely
the bank for us then.
For sure.
Oh, no.
The good side is that he couldn't spot an
outlaw if they took a dump in his hat.
The bad side is
he just proved it.
No. Two riders.
The one on the left,
that's J.D. Kincaid.
Wanted for bank robbery
in four states.
Maybe he didn't spot me.
His gang must be
in town somewhere.
He wouldn't be dumb enough to try and
take that bank with just two men.
That's different.
You better follow him,
careful-like.
I'll meet you
back at the stables.
Whiskey.
At least six of 'em.
One of 'em a guy with an eye patch?
A big fella?
That's Spencer.
That's the Kincaid gang.
They're here after the bank.
Should have known. Biggest
cattle sale of the year,
Town not expectin' anything.
Outlaw thinkin'.
We got two choices.
We go in now, first.
Take the bank right now.
Only it ain't worth takin'
till the sale's over.
Second choice: We let Kincaid
knock over the bank,
We jump him
on the way out of town.
Which way out of town?
I hate these big cities.
What? Three?
Third choice?
We quit.
Find another bank.
What's wrong?
What is it?
"Outlaws. Bank."
Oh, I gotta alert the members.
Pete, you go get the
Marshal, and I'll, uh...
I'll sound the alarm.
Don't run.
- We give up!
- Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it!
Don't shoot!
All right, step forward!
Everybody, step forward!
Put your weapons on the ground.
Lay them on the ground.
This way! Hurry!
Set it up right there.
That's good.
We're gonna get a shot of Marshal
Kurtz capturing all the bank robbers.
All right.
Hold it.
Come on, you sidewinders!
Get moving now!
You got a lot of nerve comin' here to this
town and pullin' something like that!
All right now. We want to set up the
shot right in front of the town hall.
I'll never forget the look on their
faces when they saw all those guns.
Yes, siree. It'll be
a cold day in hell...
Before any outlaw even thinks
about robbing this...
you're the committee of
the law and order association.
Now, you must stand
perfectly still the whole time.
Wait for me at the horses.
One more thing I gotta do.
Gentlemen, just a little bit
closer together, please.
If you folks would move off just a
little bit. Thank you very much.
Now, gentlemen, please,
as still as possible.
This one is for
the big papers back east.
They want to see
the original committee...
And, of course,
our next governor.
All right, gentlemen.
Hold it.
How long are these buzzards
gonna stay in town?
Oh, as long
as they're bein' paid.
They'll stay until they realize
that Jack ain't never comin' back.
Never?
But he promised Lana.
Oh, right. A man don't have
to keep his word to a whore?
Someone should have
told Lana that ten years ago.
Maybe. She ain't
gonna hear it today.
Lana, why don't you come inside and
share a nice cold lemonade with me?
Oh, I'm just gettin' a breath
of fresh air away from them.
Jack's most likely waitin' till
things get a bit quieter here.
Well, of course. I mean, he can't
just ride up in broad daylight.
They'd spot him a mile away.
Honey, how many men
have asked you...
To ride off with 'em,
maybe even marry 'em?
More than I can count.
Start countin', darlin'.
Or one day you're gonna be
standin' on some dusty porch...
Waitin' for a knight
in shining armor...
That really ain't a knight at
all, just some greedy old cow...
What?
Shut up.
- Just shut up and drive.
- Howdy, ma'am.
Kincaid gang.
Huh.
Hey, Ben, relax.
Lana will be all right.
It's just a hick town.
No sheriff.
Besides, it's been two weeks
and no one's lookin' for us.
Yep, we did
the perfect crime, kid.
And no one will ever
know about it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you get everything,
honey? Any problems?
Maybe.
Ben, why don't you check my supplies, make
sure I've packed them nice and tight?
Newspaper got a letter with this
bank manager's watch as proof.
The letter says that you were the
mastermind behind the robbery,
That you double-crossed
the Kincaid gang.
They even pointed out
your photograph.
And, Jack, the letter
was signed "comanche."
Read out that part
underneath my likeness.
Read it out loud.
"Ten thousand dollar reward
for Mr. Lightnin' Jack Kane,
Described by Marshal Kurtz as meaner than
a rattlesnake and twice as cunning."
Oh, Ben, why?
Ten thousand dollars reward.
Ha!
Meaner than a rattlesnake.
Twice as cunning.
Ten thousand dollars.
More cunning than a rattler!
Ten thou...
That's a... Indian ritual.
Comanches.
We better get rollin'.
Every lawman in the territory's
gonna be lookin' for me and Ben.
Maybe... maybe every lawman
in the country, eh?
Hey, Ben, we're the Kane gang.
We're outlaws.
Jack, folks in town said this trail
leads through hostile Apache country.
Good.
See this?
It's a spirit bag.
Bought it off
an Apache medicine man.
That makes me a full blood brother to
the Apache. I'm practically family.
It was only $50. Well,
even if it works for you,
What about me and Ben?
No problem. See, this
covers my whole family.
I'll just tell 'em
you're my wife...
And, uh, Ben's our kid.
Anyway, relax, there ain't an
injun within 100 miles of here.
'Cause I can tell.
