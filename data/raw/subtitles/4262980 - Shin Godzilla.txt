"Shin Godzilla (2016)" ^ (Run time 01:59:50)
SHIN GODZILLA
Tokyo Bay, off the coast of Yokohama
Offshore of Haneda Airport
A pleasure craft has been spotted
adrift offshore of Haneda.
Japan Coast Guard Patrol Boat PC16
- Hamanami, roger that.
Pleasure craft confirmed.
No apparent damage.
The "GLORY-MARU".
Registration: MJG-15041.
Requesting owner information.
Boarding the vessel.
Hello.
Anyone here?
No one on the flying deck.
No sign of life.
Some personal effects.
No traces of an incident.
Perhaps a fall overboard?
Vessel's vacant.
We'll prepare a tow.
Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line Aqua Bridge
Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line Aqua Tunnel
Wait, wait, wait!
Prime Minister's Office, Chiyoda Ward
5th Floor Hallway - Just received a
report from Intelligence gathering center
The Aqua-Line has sprung a leak.
Water's pouring onto the auto lanes.
Actual details still unknown.
But several cars are trapped in it.
A liaison office is up,
and an emergency order issued.
Understood.
And the PM?
Arriving in 28 minutes.
We need more information, let's go down.
Yes, sir.
First report confirmed at about 8:30 a.m.
Leak in the Tokyo Aqua-Line tunnel,
near the 2.5 kilo marker.
Seawater entering from a fissure
in the tunnel ceiling.
Crisis Management Center
- Several cars involved.
Hamanami Coast Guard personnel are
caught in the steam cloud in the bay.
Executive Meeting Room
- Aqua-Line has closed both ways.
Coast Guard is issuing the alerts.
Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
- Status, Mr. Koriyama?
Koriyama, Crisis Management Supervisor
- Regarding the tunnel, 5 confirmed vehicle collisions
Was the tunnel incident caused by Earthquake?
Oki, Deputy Director (Japan Meteorological Agency)
- We're still checking with our agency.
Any relation to the underwater eruption?
Not enough info to confirm that yet.
We have heli footage!
Yusuke Shimura, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
(Ministry of Defense)
Looks like an underwater volcanic eruption?
If so, it feels anomalous.
Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line Wind Tower - This is Coast
Guard 691 reporting, the steam is still erupting.
- Japan Coast Guard Super Puma 225 MH691
- The churning water is preventing
any verification of the undersea situation.
Since we are unable to surmise the current situation,
we'll need a unified initial response
The response team is hereby officially instated.
FDMA disaster force is in place.
3rd Regional Coast Guard HQ
has sealed the bay.
No sea or air access.
A coastal evacuation advisory
has been issued.
Tokyo Bay, Kisarazu Island (Umihotaru Parking Area)
- This is an evacuation warning.
Please evacuate the premises immediately!
Please follow the police instructions
and evacuate to Kisarazu!
Tokyo Bay Aqua Line Aqua Tunnel
- Holy crap!
Tunnel's leaking!
Watch your head!
Cool!
A slide.
Aqua Tunnel Evacuation Slide
Be careful.
We're heading back to ER from the site.
Aqua Tunnel Evacuation Passage
- This place is awesome.
I hate this, my feet hurt.
This is awesome!
I'm getting scoop footage.
- What? What's that noise?
- Something's up there.
This is bad.
I don't know what's happening
by it's freaking me out.
- What's that?
- Something's there.
Crisis Management Center Conference Room Stairs
The PM has returned.
5th Floor Hallway
- Aqua-Line rupture is unconfirmed.
Prime Minister and attendants
- Never mind the details. Any fatalities?
No.
Then leave it to the guys below.
There's secondary disaster risk.
I've canceled your meeting.
There's a briefing in five minutes.
I see.
Understood.
PM's Office, 5th floor, Briefing for the Prime Minister
- What are the cases for it being some
undersea thermal discharge?
Sekiguchi, Minister of Science
- An unidentified nuclear sub meltdown?
Hanamori, Minister of Defence
- Impossible. The bay is too shallow for a submarine.
Yanagihara, Minister of Transportation
- We believe it to be a magma steam.
A new undersea volcanic eruption.
Excuse me, Minister Yanagihara.
The epicenter is shallow
and appears to be just steam.
We're confident it's not volcanic activity.
Really?
Then tell me sooner.
A new, large hydrothermal vent?
That's it.
That must be it.
But, a vent directly above the tunnel?
Past geological surveys rule that out.
Kanai, Minister of Disaster Management
- An oversight, perhaps?
Mr. Prime Minister.
Something's on the sea floor.
Seiji Okochi, Prime Minister
- Some "thing"? Like what?
It's speculate to be a colossal creature.
Footages online are confirming this.
Preposterous.
You're saying a big whale spouting?
The sea is boiling. What creature could
withstand a temperature over 100 degrees?
Kono, Minister of Internal Affairs
- We've been scouring online videos.
We've yet to find
any conclusive evidence.
Azuma, Chief Cabinet Secretary - Time is a wasting.
How about a process of elimination?
That's right.
A new volcano or a large thermal vent.
What else could it be?
Then let the cabinet discuss this
and come out with a basic response.
Is it fine with you, Mr. Prime Minister?
I understand.
So everyone, let's move
to the main conference room.
Yaguchi.
The Prime Minister and the cabinet
know what they are doing.
Don't stir things up.
I believe we should
consider every possibility.
Hideki Akasaka, Aide to the Prime Minister
(National Security Officer) - It's good to be a rebel,
Hideki Akasaka, Aide to the Prime Minister (National
Security Officer) - but think of the guy who got you here.
Got it?
Word of advice.
Fourth Floor Conference Room
- All those injured in the tunnel are receiving care.
Conference regarding the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line incident
Fireboats and helicopters are
mobilized in Tokyo Bay.
Satomi, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries, is absent on a trip to Australia.
They stand ready to respond.
That concludes my report.
Next, regarding to Tokyo Bay coastal region...
...we're at evacuation preparedness level.
Due to possible debris and ash,
we're grounding all flights out
of Haneda until further notice.
Forgive me.
Correction.
The grounding of all flights out of Haneda
is unavoidable to ensure citizen
safety over economic concerns...
Later
As for the undersea
volcano-induced tunnel flooding.
Fortunately, no toxic gasses
have been detected.
Teams from the Archaeological
Agency and the Coast Guard
are en route to conduct a
thorough investigation of the cause.
Eruption activity is
reportedly dying down rapidly.
Is it over?
No big deal, I guess.
Mr. Prime Minister.
I beg to reiterate...
...the presence of a large marine creature...
...as a possible cause.
Yaguchi.
This is no place for jokes.
This is a ministerial meeting.
Minutes are kept.
Don't make mockery of it.
With no time frame for restoration,
we can expect those losses to swell.
Sorry!
We must suspend this meeting.
The television.
Turn on the TV!
It's unbelievable!
It's really unbelievable!
I've never seen anything like it.
What was that?
A tail?
Yes, It's a tail.
It seems Yaguchi's hypothesis
did come true.
Due to the sudden change in the situation,
let us adjourn this meeting.
Cabinet ministers are to assemble
in the Prime Minister's office immediately.
So what the hell is it?
For now, we only know it as the
"Giant Unidentified Creature."
We're making a list of
biologists and scholars
from universities and research organizations.
We'll hold an emergency summit
to figure this out.
We got to understand this thing quickly.
Do it now.
Yes!
Mr. Prime Minister.
Besides knowing the truth about the tail,
perhaps we should focus on our response.
Yes, of course.
And this thing is larger than expected.
Whatever it is,
I think our choices are simple.
Let it go.
That is leave it alone.
Or capture it, exterminate it,
or just chase it off.
Kabira, Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs
- I vote for extermination.
Hayama, Secretary of Economic Industry
- I agree.
Even if we ignore what happened
to the tunnel
it has caused the cancellation of all flights
at the Haneda Airport
and indefinite closing of Tokyo Bay.
Presenting causing huge economic losses.
I, too, favor extermination.
That's right, exterminate it immediately.
Right, Defense minister?
Matsumoto, Supervisor of Defensive Operational Policy
- We do have a contingency plan
for a wildlife-based threat.
But never with Self-Defense Forces
using weapons in Tokyo Bay.
Then, can't we just chase it
back into the sea?
Mr. Prime Minister, Academic circles and
environmentalists are saying this is a rare species
and are already calling
for it's live capture
to provide for further studies.
No, it has to be exterminated.
Using a torpedo would do the trick.
I can understand how you feel
but there are civilians in the area.
Please think seriously of the consequences
of using weaponry.
I, too, think live capture
is more appropriate.
I suggest we start gathering Intel
on the unidentified creature.
Taking appropriate actions for
different scenarios.
Hiraoka, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
- Uh, which department are you addressing?
The Vapor cloud seems to be moving
towards the Tama River!
Uh.
It's moving?
It's alive, isn't it?
Tama River mouth, Tokyo Bay
The unidentified creature is off
from Haneda Airport Runway D,
entering the Tama River!
We have reports of flooding
on the Bayshore Expressway.
Not again!
Forget live capturing it.
Anzai, Prime Minister's Secretary of Internal Affairs
- Mr. Prime Minister. Biologists are starting to arrive.
Only three so far, but...
Prime Minister's Reception Room, 5th floor
Emergency Academic Conference
on Giant Unidentified Creature
Dr. Shiga, paleontologist
- It's indiscernible from TV images
whether it's some dinosaur
or a whale
or distinguish which species are they.
Dr. Yanagi, marine biologist
- It seems to be a never-before seen aquatic species.
Without an physical examination
I can't say anything.
Dr. Hanawa, biologist
- First of all, whether the footage is real
and authenticated.
If I were to rush to judgment.
Based on unverified evidence...
...I'd lose credibility as a biologist.
The conference with the experts
is wrapping up in 5 minutes.
5th Floor Secretary's office
- This is ludicrous.
Asahi Bridge on the Nomi River, Ota Ward
What a waste of time that was.
These experts don't know a thing.
I agree.
Damn their status,
get me someone.
Hurry and get me someone
who knows something.
Yes, Sir.
Shimura, any ideas?
I seem to recall a senior working
at the Environment Ministry,
but she's just a deputy chief.
It's okay.
Get her her immediately.
Hiromi Ogashira, Ministry of the
Environment Deputy Chief, Wildlife Division
It looks serpentine with
the auxiliary ambulation.
Gills make it aquatic.
With legs it can survive on land too.
Since it has legs,
will it come on land?
Yes.
It's a possibility.
Really?
What then?
Frankly, we haven't determined
how to deal with it.
The experts think due to the unidentified creature
has lived a long time in the water,
it's legs have degenerated and wouldn't be
able to support it's own weight.
So coming ashore is
physiologically impossible.
Pardon my frankness.
I think it can support it's own weight.
Is that so?
What's your view, Environment Minister?
Kikugawa, Minister of the Environment
- Forgive the deputy chief's poor decorum.
I too agree with
your experts' conclusion,
that the unidentified creature
coming on land is very improbable.
I see.
Mr. Prime Minister, considering
the damage wreaked this far...
the sooner we hold a press conference
to calm the public, the better.
Mr. Prime Minister, for now
avoid the uncertainties,
just give only verified information.
Okay.
Prepare my disaster prevention uniform
and speech.
New Nomi Bridge, Nomi River, Ota Ward
1st Floor Press Conference Room - The unidentified
creature that has caused the Aqua-Line and
Tama River to sustain significant damage
is currently moving up the Nomi River.
We're yet to identify
what sort of creature it is.
And we are uncertain
if it will come on land.
Due to the fact that the unidentified creature
has lived in the water for a long time,
it's legs have degenerated.
Coming ashore, it couldn't stand up
and might even killed itself doing so.
So everyone, please don't worry.
I repeat.
The giant unidentified creature
will not come ashore.
Everyone, please set your minds at ease.
Mr. Prime Minister, excuse the interruption.
What, at Kamata?
Kamata, Ota Ward
Hurry! Hurry!
Run away!
Run!
Hurry!
What's that?
Announcing it will not come ashore.
Underground Access Hallway
- Now what? I just announced it will not come ashore.
That's why we reminded you earlier
please just stick to the script!
I needed to reassure the public.
Common sense calls for that.
You're right.
Right now the experts are discussing
how it came ashore.
Screw them.
What's happening out there?
Mr. Prime Minister, we need to set up
an emergency disaster control headquarters.
I know.
Conference regarding Emergency Disaster Control
for Giant Unidentified Creature
This cabinet council is now adjourned.
Okay, everyone,
let's get to work.
- 4th Floor Hallway
- So much red tape.
Every action requires a meeting.
That's the foundation of democracy.
Even to hold a press conference?
Given the unidentified creature
has come ashore at Toyko.
We have set up emergency
disaster control headquarters.
We are crafting a full-scale response
to secure citizen safety,
including a speeding coordinated evacuation
with all federal government
agencies and ministries...
The creature's heading toward Shinagawa.
At a speed of about
13 km per hour.
It moves quite slowly
for it's size.
Even with this speed, it can
trample through Tokyo in 3 hours.
It's hard to think
Tokyo is so brittle.
Oh no. The damage caused by
the unidentified creature is growing.
That's why I voted earlier
to exterminate it.
But, it's a densely-populated area.
Instead of attacking it,
we must evacuate people first.
Have MIC and MILT set up
evacuation zones and transport.
Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building
9th Floor Disaster Control HQ - We've got orders
from the PM to conduct evacuation measures.
Kozuka, Governor of Tokyo
- Why didn't the evacuation order come immediately?
This incident is too fallacious.
Nothing in any of the
first response manuals applies here.
Since when do the first response manual
application ever been used?
Just expedite an evacuation plan immediately.
But we've never gone through
such disaster scenarios.
Tahara, Vice Governor - A hasty city-wide
evacuation might cause a general panic.
Kawamata, Vice Governor
- The citizens will have to self-evacuate.
Onchi, Superintendent General
- We'll make every effort to control traffic.
Highway 15, Shinagawa Ward
- The traffic signals are out of order.
Please leave your vehicles and
follow the police instructions.
The Tokyo Government has ordered
a full evacuation of Shinagawa.
All residents are required to
evacuate immediately.
Mama, hurry up!
At this rate, the city will be in ruins
Contact the Public Safety Commission.
We can request Self Defense Forces
(SDF) for pest extermination.
And use of weapons?
Interpreted as an armed
attack under Article 76...
Self-defense troops can use force.
This doesn't qualify as an armed attack.
Article 76 stipulates "by an
aggressor country or equivalent."
It's no time for semantics.
Only the SDF is equipped to respond.
That means soldiers engaging
in urban combat.
That will give the Prime Minister pause.
And so, Mr. Prime Minister, we need to
announce a state of emergency immediately
that involves both military force
and civilian evacuation,
and also all measures
taken by the cabinet.
Right now, our only extralegal measure
is mobilization for defense.
Only the Prime Minister can decide that.
You're talking about...
a declaration with no precedent.
By mobilizing, we're declaring
the country for war.
Mr. Prime Minister,
for the police to handle a evacuation
in such a short time would be difficult.
But if we mobilize...
we have to let the public be prepared
for a likelihood of war.
No, no.
I don't want that.
Can we get the U.S. to kill this beast
under the Security Treaty?
No.
Our government and SDF must move first.
Even under the Treaty,
the U.S. can only provide support.
We're facing a living organism.
Aggravating it might only
lead to more damages.
Yes, it's an organism.
That means we can stop it.
Unlike an earthquake or a typhoon.
Mr. Prime Minister,
protecting citizens is our top priority.
Prime Minister, this is a tough decision,
but to prevent further calamity...
please make a swift decision.
Make the decision right now?
Are you serious?
Time is precious.
Please decide.
Moment ago, unprecedentedly
the Prime Minister has announced ...
on the disaster countermeasures,
a national state of emergency
calling for the mobilization of the Self Defense
Forces to defend against the unidentified creature.
The mobilization of the Self Defense Forces
is the first post-war military action
since World War II
for the purpose of the
"pest extermination".
Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building A
(Ministry of Defense) - At Tokyo's request,
Nerima 1st division has been dispatched.
Underground Command Room - They're tasked
first with guiding rescue and evacuation efforts.
But they're not equipped for battle, right?
Atsushi, Chief of the Ground Staff
- Normal helicopters are unable to battle.
It seems attack helicopters
are more expedient.
- Confirm with Kisarazu base again.
- Yes, sir.
Ozawa, Chief of the Air Staff
- Shall we deploy F-2 missiles at Misawa?
No.
Hamada, Joint Staff Commander
- Any civilian casualties could hinder the SDF.
Let's minimize the weapons' firepower.
Kitano, Chief of the Maritime Staff
- But we don't know it's capability.
I think we need to be commit
all of SDF's resources.
Yajima, Joint Staff Deputy General
- I agree.
There's a need to integrate
all 3 sea, land, air forces.
Call the PM.
For the east side, the joint force will be
lead by the Eastern Army.
The goal, extermination of the creature.
Zaizen, Joint Staff General
- The ground troops will focused on civilian evacuation.
The rapid response helicopters
will be our primary attack force.
Mr. Prime Minister, there could still be
disabilities, sick and elderly in the city.
That's why I can't make a decision
without an inspection.
Under such conditions, a little
collateral damage is unavoidable.
Mr. Prime Minister,
although it's not easy,
but you need to
make a decision.
I know.
Ground Self Defense Force Kisarazu Base,
Chiba Prefecture
This mission full of risks and uncertainties.
Should we call for support?
No, the standard staff would do.
This is what we signed up
for when we enlisted.
Fourth Anti-tank Helicopter Unit,
Second Flying Squadron - Order! Arms!
Ground Self Defense Force AH-1S Attack Helicopter
- Lift off from Kisarazu at 13:08.
Arriving at destination at 13:20, over.
Underground Access Elevator, Prime Minister's Office
- What a relief. The creature may be big,
but this ought to do the trick.
Maybe we can rebuild
the town with it's carcass.
Minister Yanagihara.
Wishful thinking and armchair theories
by the old Imperial Army
in the last war
led to 3 million
Japanese lives lost.
Beware of unfounded optimism.
Kitashinagawa
Please watch your step.
Remain calm.
Get away from here quickly!
Time is of the essence.
Local evacuation centers are pointless.
Tell us the new evacuation locations,
PLEASE!
The giant unidentified creature
has stopped moving!
It has stopped it's progression.
Stopped?
Why all of sudden?
Incredible.
It's evolving.
Shinagawa Shrine
Kitashinagawa Station
Yatsuyama Rail Bridge
Attacker 1,
this is CP, over.
CP, Attacker 1, over.
Head to holding area 2
to await further orders, over.
Ashida, 2nd Flying Squadron Commander
- Attacker 1, copy.
2d Flying Squadron Gunner
- Target is different from the Intel.
CP, this is Attacker 1.
Target is different from Intel.
I repeat.
Target is different from Intel.
Attacker 1, CP, hold your position.
Await instructions.
Resident evacuation is complete.
Understood.
Minister Hanamori, we're ready to open fire.
Understood.
Mr. Prime Minister,
you can begin the attack.
I understand.
Go ahead.
Attacker 1, CP,
commence fire on the target.
I repeat, commence fire, over.
CP, Attacker 1, copy.
Commencing fire.
Target straight ahead.
Aim for the head.
Distance 300.
Ready, aim...
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Why aren't they firing?
Ground Self Defense Force OH-1 Scout Helicopter
- While confirming the surrounding, we found
Surveyor
- civilians near the line of fire!
Fourth Anti-tank Helicopter Unit, Kisarazu Base
- There are civilians still not evacuated. Should we fire?
Joint Task Force Central Command, Camp Asaka
- There are civilians still not evacuated. Should we fire?
Ministry of Defense HQ, Central Command Post
- There are civilians still not evacuated. Should we fire?
Crisis Management Center Conference Room,
Prime Minister's Office - There are civilians.
Should we proceed firing?
Mr. Prime Minister,
can we proceed with firing?
Mr. Prime Minister!
Abort.
Abort the attack!
The Self Defense Force must not
fire on the civilians!
Attacker 1, CP, abort attack.
Holding your position, over.
Copy. Abort attack!
Holding positions!
The unidentified creature
is on the move again.
Breaking through the expressway,
and heading towards Tokyo Bay.
Tokyo, Ota Ward
All flights are canceled
at Haneda Airport.
Shinagawa is now under the Fire department's control.
New fire outbreak in Shinagawa.
Most train lines are still running.
Heads of countries are
pledging their supports.
Tokyo is recruiting helpers
and aid workers.
The Tokyo Exchange is open as usual...
The bullet train is operating
shuttle services from Shin Yokohama.
Scientist envoys from France
and other nations have arrived.
The unidentified creature has not
been spotted in the Uraga Channel.
The search zone has
continued to expand.
The casualty count is
up to 100 as a result of...
The defense at Ota Ward is ready.
Disaster Management lead by
Minister Kasai
has began to survey
and assess the damage.
Giant Unidentified Creature disaster site, Ota Ward
- Giant Unidentified Creature Government
Damage Assessment Team - It was only
ashore for about 2 hours, and look what it did.
No.
Unfortunately, we've used the 2 hours
to decide an initial response.
It was a sudden incident.
It can't be helped.
Everyone did their best
even if it's not perfect.
Don't get smug, Yaguchi.
Time is short,
let's meet the press.
Mr. Minister, this way.
I understand.
Sagami Bay, Oshima Island vicinity
Maritime Self Defense Force
Takanami-class destroyer Onami DD-111
Commencing sea observatory.
Rotary Wing Patrol Helicopter SH-60K
Dipping sonar
We believe after the unidentified creature
has left the shore,
it passed through Kanaya
heading towards Tokyo Bay.
Right now, we're strengthening surveillance...
especially around Chiba and Sagami Bay.
But if it's hiding in Sagami Trough,
detection will be moot.
That is to say.
Who knows where or
when it'll emerge?
How are the preparations
if it comes ashore again?
GSDF Camp Asaka, Nerima Ward
Joint Task Force Central Command - Once spotted,
a rapid land strategy at water's edge will be difficult
We'll need multiple plans
Yamaoka, Eastern Commander - for a landing
point encounter and expeditionary pursuit.
Samejima, Eastern Director of Defense
- I'll get right on it.
Coordinated artillery, tanks and F-2 scenarios.
3rd Floor Entrance Hall, Prime Minister's Office
- Defensive operations lean heavily on the Kanto area.
Cabinet Press Conference
The metro area has to take priority.
Looks like a 5th floor order.
What about the regions?
Tokyo's 13 million people,
GNP of 85 trillion yen.
That's 17 % of total Japan.
And in the Kanto region?
40 % and 200 trillion.
Seems like a prudent strategy to me.
Protecting a country isn't easy.
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary's office, 5th Floor
- They've set up a special response team
in the PM's residence.
Fujinose restaurant, Akasaka District, Minato Ward
- And I hear you were appointed it's bureau chief.
You're rising in the world,
feels good, right?
- Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Director & Cabinet
Minister of State for Special Missions - I want
you to pick the team. You know bureaucrats.
Okay.
Shuichi Izumi, Vice President of the
Liberal Democratic Party - I'll round up
people who'll speak their mind to the PM.
Yeah.
People with balls.
I'm Tachikawa.
Takeo.
Ready, lift.
2nd Floor Conference Room
Giant Unidentified Creature Crisis
Management Headquarters - I'm Rando
Yaguchi from Giant Unidentified Creature HQ.
We operate as a flat organization here.
So please let us forget
about titles and seniority.
Speak freely here.
What it means is.
Although I'm nominally in charge,
but we're a crack team of lone wolves,
nerds, troublemakers, drop outs,
outcasts, academic heretics
and general pains-in-the-bureaucracy.
So do your thing
and whatever you like.
Mori, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Bureaucrat
- Here are the basic specs.
Each department find out
whatever you can.
Is this all?
Yup. Our job is to fill in
the remaining blanks.
If you have info,
please share it.
Just to add,
Yesterday the "council of experts"
was too baffled by the situation
to conclude anything.
Hazama, Johoku University biologist
- I put together a simple profile.
First, second and 3rd configurations.
And more mutations on the way.
And there's more?
Yasuda, Basic Research Promotion Division Chief
- By the way, we're analyzing a sample
of it's body fluid at our lab.
If you have samples,
pass some to us.
I'll get outside help.
The U.S. took all the remaining samples.
Sodehara, Joint Task Force Lt. Director General
- On-site remains are being burned due to stench.
Komatsubara, Foreign Policy Director
- Under American pressure, I hear.
Okay.
Then we'll leave the analysis to you.
Any info from Behavioral Biology?
Behaviorally, it just seems to move.
Can't determine intellect.
I think communication with it is unlikely.
Tachikawa, Director of Nuclear Power
- Let me ask a simple question.
What is it's energy source?
Indeed, It needs an enormous
amount of energy.
Not just to move, but metabolically.
Oxygen conversion in it's digestive tract
wouldn't be enough.
All that energy.
Could it be Nuclear fission?
You're joking, Ms. Ogashira?
That's impossible.
Yokosuka Bay, Kanagawa Prefecture
Yokosuka Bay, emergency departure?
Yeah.
We heard that Yokosuka Bay's radiation
monitoring alarm went off.
I understand.
I'll check with the
Nuclear Regulation Authority.
Monitoring Department, Nuclear Regulation Authority,
Minato Ward - Yeah. I have orders not to go public yet.
But radiation levels in the
metro area have risen.
Where is the leak coming from?
A reactor?
Negishi, Nuclear Regulatory
Authority Monitoring Manager - No.
Negishi, Nuclear Regulatory Authority
Monitoring Manager - We've not found
a leak at any of the nation's reactors.
Then where's the radiation coming from?
- Is that possible?
- Huh?
This data shows areas where the
radiation spikes matching the creatures path.
Look here.
See?
Which means Miss Ogashira was right.
Sorry.
Today 13:00, Tokyo, Shinagawa ward, radiation level
is 0.5165 uSv/h. 16.1 time higher than normal level.
This information is already
spreading publicly.
Let's get to Chief Secretary's office.
Contact Chief Secretary Akasaka and Mr. Morito.
Chief Cabinet Secretary's office,
5th Floor, Prime Minister's Office
This is trouble.
That is why the ministers and PM needs
to call an immediate press conference.
Morito, Secretary to the Chief Cabinet Secretary
- But, without knowing the source of the radiation,
by announcing this to the press
might end up stoking the public's fear.
It's not enough of a spike
to warrant evacuation.
There are no legal grounds to it.
No matter what's the alert,
it's still a matter of radioactivity.
Call the press as soon as possible.
That's right.
I'll do it.
Let me talk to the PM.
Schedule a Prime Minister's briefing.
Five minutes.
Japan-U.S. heads of state conference call
- Yes, President Ross, I understand. Thank you.
A lot of unilateral requests.
Typically American.
The U.S. President has
sent us an emissary
who wants a secret meeting
with the PM.
They move fast.
Yeah.
He just left Yokota Air Base
and is on his way here.
Foreign Ministry's in chaos.
I hear his aide has made
an appointment to meet with you.
With me?
Why?
Kayoco Anne-Patterson, Special Presidential Envoy
- I read your administrations reports.
And I'm interested in your past.
I could use a talented person like you.
I need a person I can work with.
That's you, Rando Yaguchi.
Any objections?
No.
But I think Prime Minister aide Akasaka
is more appropriate.
He turned me down already,
that's why I chose you.
Whatever you do,
don't stain my work record.
I want to find this person.
The reason is?
This person foresaw
this scenario several years ago.
This reason good enough?
We know he landed in
Narita airport 7 days ago.
Goro Maki.
Japanese.
Former university professor.
I hear your intelligence agency
is quite efficient.
I'll be hearing from you.
What's in it for us?
A trade. You give me the details about him,
I'll hand you the Intel we've gathered.
But, a third party country
must not know about this.
Just U.S.-Japan,
so, win-win.
Understood.
Let's get to it.
Thank you.
I rushed to Yokota straight from a
party, so I didn't have time to change.
Where's Zara?
Kayoco Anne Patterson.
She's very young.
America admirably values
performance over age.
And she's Senator Patterson's daughter.
The one behind the Kern Agreement.
Formidable.
A mixture of talent,
pedigree and coattails.
Not really your type, I suspect.
Nope.
If she unabashedly uses
her father's connections...
...she's the political type, like Yaguchi.
Tokyo Central Government Building Two,
Chiyoda Ward
Commissioner-General Secretariat, National Police
Agency - Searching for an individual at a time like this?
It's for Rando Yaguchi.
I owe a great debt
to his father.
Just say how many men you need.
Sawaguchi, Commissioner's Secretariat
- This is his profile.
Motobe, Criminal Affairs Director
- A rebellious professor, expelled from Japan.
Although a biologist,
he worked at a U.S. energy firm.
Interesting old man.
A red notice?
No.
Just locate him.
After that, the NSA or CIA
will take it from there.
Don't bring any mess here.
This is his last whereabouts.
My grandma's country sure works fast.
But he's gone missing
a few days ago.
The Coast Guard found
his boat adrift at sea.
"GLORY-MARU"
Emissary Patterson.
Were you looking for the professor?
Or this?
Yeah, that too.
"I did as I pleased.
You do the same."
Looks like his last words?
You want to take a look at this?
No need.
I trust you.
It's printed with special ink.
Can't be copied.
I'll take photos
to share with my team.
Godzilla?
That's right. It's the DOE's
code name. "GODZILLA".
He gave it an English name.
Gojira.
What does it mean?
I got one hit.
On Ohdo Island, where he's from,
it means "God incarnate".
A violent one. I hear that's
why he put "God" in the name.
In Japanese, the name read "Gojira."
"Gojira"...
...you say?
Who cares about
it's name at this point?
It's just as well
it originated in the U.S..
Now we know what to call it.
The government is unofficially calling
the giant unidentified creature "Gojira."

National Diet Building Gardens, Chiyoda Ward
Goro Maki?
Ex-biology professor at Jonan University.
Find out who he was.
You'll get an exclusive when
the time's right to go to print.
I'd appreciate your help.
That's a promise.
Hayafune, Freelance Journalist
- Yes, I know.
This is 60 years ago.
Unregulated dumping of radioactive material
from every country.
Don't tell me...
Gojira fed on these.
Yes.
That's the DOE's conclusion.
When DOE noticed the
radioactive material dumping,
they sent requests to various institutions
to analyze the containers.
Dr. Maki was the main figure.
Suddenly, an ancient species of marine life
found itself surrounded by radioactive waste.
And rapidly mutated into an
organism that could withstand it.
That's his Godzilla theory.
But, emissary Patterson,
it's body was much longer
when it came ashore.
Yes.
It can suddenly mutate,
from sea organism to land.
With the current DNA Intel, this Godzilla's
mutation surpasses anything I could imagine.
This is all the information at my disposal.
From now on.
Personal service.
Dr. Maki left this behind?
I can't make sense of it.
It's not a molecular array.
How does it relate to Gojira?
I may not understand this,
but this could be an analytical table
of structural layers.
Dr. Maki intentionally left out
some unexplained data at America.
With this, we now have
the complete version.
Do you mind if we analyze it?
Sure.
Please, I'm bad at Japanese honorifics.
Can we go informal?
Okay, then I'll be frank.
What does the U.S. want with Gojira?
Capture to Study
or exterminate?
That's for the president to decide.
In your country,
who makes the decision?
Prime Minister's Signature
Cabinet Approved Victim Relief and Reconstruction Bill
4th Floor Hallway - Finally a cabinet
decision on the relief and recovery bill.
The Gojira bill, too, will be
an inter-agency nightmare.
Lack of precedent will cloud orders.
Expect a lot of passing the buck.
Second Floor Hallway
- At least the security bill passed easily.
Foreign Ministry muscle,
under U.S. pressure.

The U.S. wants to use it's
Gojira info as a diplomatic card.
Let's pray our crafty Aide Akasaka
can handle the White House.
These are the results of the
disaster site analysis.
Gamma rays match no known
elements whatsoever.
This is an incredible discovery.
This Gojira, right?
It's body harbors new elements.
This is why the U.S. Dept. Of Energy
moved so quickly.
Let's take this data with us.
- Contact the Prime Minister.
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
Radiation too is a problem.
So...
...how much can we say?
Here are the results after analyzing
the substances recovered from Gojira.
Radiation in the stricken area.
Small amount at 0.5165 uSv/h
microsieverts
Thanks for the food.
Thank you for the food.
Even with the information
the U.S. shared,
I feel like falling into a gridlock.
Yeah.
Riken's report is truly shocking.
Gojira has 8 times more
genes than humans.
It'll take years to
sequence all of it.
I'm also confirm that Gojira is the
most evolved creature on the planet.
Not evolution
but Capable of self-mutation.
That trumps human intelligence.
But Gojira is still an organism.
It can be killed.
I sure hope so.
That's what we're here to find out.
Any more news from
behavior study department?
It just walks
Since it came ashore,
why did it suddenly decide
to return to Tokyo Bay?
I got it.
The coolness.
Gojira has something of a
nuclear reactor on it's body,
and so it's fins
act as heat sinks.
Meaning there's a high possibility
that it is a cold blood animal.
So it went back
to sea temporarily
to adjust it's body temperature
after mutating.
So, maybe our only option
is to shut down
it's internal cooling system.
Forcing Gojira to do a
reactor scram to stay alive.
Rapid cooling may not kill it,
but could immobilize him.
- Machida, METI Manufacturing Director
- Like administering a blood coagulation drug.
Is it possible to administer
directly into Gojira?
We'll examine all practical methods.
Perhaps a compression pump.
Takeo, MLIT Disaster Management & Transport Safety
Deputy Director - We, the health ministry and METI,
will gather the necessary
coagulant and equipment.
Submit it to the PM
as the "Yaguchi Plan."
Okay.
Name aside, let's get on it.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
"Godzilla is God!"
"Save Godzilla!"
Thank you for your hard work.
Ah.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Everyone, let's take a break.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary's office guests
- Everyone is collaborating voluntarily.
They don't go home to rest,
not even when they are asked to.
Even if they do, they come back early
with warm food for everyone.
It's very inspiring.
None of that jurisdictional
infighting among ministries.
Just people working together.
A lot of outsiders have tirelessly
volunteered their time, too.
You're right.
There's hope for this country yet.
Truly.
And uh, Deputy Chief.
How long are you going to
wear your shirt?
Mm?
To be honest, the shirt and
the room smells a little rank.
Really?
A shower would do you good.
Deputy Chief, Gojira has resurfaced
in Sagami Bay a minute ago!
It's coming ashore!
Cape Inamura, Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture
J-Alert!
Broadcast that Gojira has come ashore!
Primary alert over Em-Net transmitted!
This is Kamakura Disaster Prevention station.
This is an emergency evacuation order.
The giant unidentified creature
has come ashore.
Everyone, please evacuate the city immediately.
I repeat.
Evacuate immediately.
Please follow the instructions
of police and fire personnel.
The Prime Minister.
Target is moving through Kamakura
towards Kamariya.
Oy.
Does it seem it has gotten
bigger since it last came ashore?
Yeah, big beyond expectation.
The face and body
have change completely.
Yeah.
It's size has nearly doubled.
It has evolved again.
Gojira in it's fourth form.
Looks like this is
going to be disastrous.
Yokodai, Isogo Ward, Yokohama City,
Kanagawa Prefecture - Citizens not in the
designate area, please take refuge indoors!
This area is under curfew.
Attention.
Citizens from this are please
evacuation immediately.
Gojira is expected to reach
Tokyo in 3 hours.
Tsukuda, Minister of Justice
- Why's it coming here again?
Ogimachi, Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture
As you can see from the report,
a direct armed assault on it's body
runs the risk of releasing
radioactive material.
To preventing Tokyo from
another attack
I suggest stopping it's progression
as our top priority.
I hear it lives on radioactive material.
If it attacks a nuclear facility,
it'll spell a worse disaster
than Gojira.
Mr. Prime Minister.
We should seize this moment
to strike it now.
Mr. Prime Minister,
we don't want to be
viewed overseas as timid.
How goes your 'Yaguchi' Plan?
Regrettably, it's not ready yet.
Mr. Prime Minister, with your order,
the SDF in the area will attack with full force.
The declared state of
emergency is still in effect.
To attack...
Mr. Prime Minister,
is your authority to give.
Mr. Prime Minister.
I know.
Commence fire.
Yes, Prime Minister.
Contact the 1st company.
Okay.
The Prime Minister has
issued new combat orders.
Assume unrestricted weapon use.
The Defense Minister has also ruled
to do whatever it takes if things turn ugly.
To eliminate Gojira before
it invades the city.
- If it comes ashore at Kanagawa,
carry out Operation B. - Okay.
Make Kawasaki the
primary battleground.
Carry out operation B-2.
Miki, Eastern Army Deputy Chief of Joint Staff

unable to continue with the strategies.
Yamamoto, Joint Task Force First Commander
- Mr. Joint Staff Vice Chief.
The Artillery brigade
is still within range.
Let's continue the attack!
No.
Ota-ku ward and Setagaya ward
are not fully evacuated.
MR. Prime Minister, I'm sorry,
they have done their best.
I understand.
Operation suspended.
We couldn't even halt it,
sad to say.
Don't lose hope.
Our job is to
protect the people,
not attacking.
Hurry and help the public evacuate.
The Tama operation has failed.
Gojira is still standing
and moving forward.
Even the SDF's effort was futile.
It's defense ability totally
exceeded our expectations.
If it could be eliminate
by standard weapons
we wouldn't be here
cracking our heads.
A super organism that
surpasses man's intelligence.
Meguro Ward, Tokyo
Target is entering Meguro Ward
from Setagaya ward!
Mr. Prime Minister, sad to say,
let's petition for U.S. troops assistance
under the Security Treaty.
Mr. Prime Minister, the
American ambassador sent word.
To protect the embassy, bombers
have been deployed from Guam.
U.S. Air Force 509th Bomb Wing
B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber
Submit a formal cooperation request.
I'll meet with the ambassador.
I'll hold an emergency
press conference on the subject.
We've requested assistance
from U.S. forces in Japan
In fighting Gojira based on the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty
These are the bombing zones
estimated by the U.S.
- Isn't this a bit widespread?
- This is preposterous.
It'll be worse than Gojira.
It seems too late for
moving and transporting.
We'll need to evacuate
the people underground.
Atagoshita Avenue, Minato Ward
- The U.S. military is launching an attack on Gojira.
It will be dangerous here.
Please evacuate to subways
and underground arcades!
Sengaku-ji Station, Asakusa Subway Line
Don't push!
This official residence
is also in Gojira's path.
It is something
the SDF has failed to stop.
The U.S. military may
too, unable to eliminate it.
Are you saying,
evacuate from here?
Yes.
Ichigaya and Ariake
are in danger too.
You must leave immediately
and transfer all officials to
the facility in Tachikawa.
But the U.S. attack
is about to begin.
I have a duty to stay
and monitor it's execution.
And also we can't abandon the citizens
to make our escape.
But Mr. Prime Minister,
even if you abandon Tokyo, but you still
have to protect the nation and the people.
Please evacuate from here.
It's a good thing the
Tokyo city hall is still functioning.
For now, let Governor Kozuka take charge.
I understand.
Arrange 2 helis from Kisarazu immediately.
Sir, we'll go by car.
Okay.
See you there.
It'll take some time
for you guys.
The traffic will be murder.
We'll meet later.
Okay.
I'll crawl if I have to.
As the Giant Unidentified Creature
is approaching,
a mandatory evacuation
order has been issued.
Please evacuate immediately.
As the Giant Unidentified Creature
is approaching,
a mandatory evacuation
order has been issued.
Please evacuate immediately.
Sotobori Avenue, Akasaka, Minato Ward
The jam here is terrible.
Traffic's not even moving.
Yeah.
U.S. is about to attack.
Let's get everyone underground.
So that's Gojira.
Deputy Chief.
The U.S. military will attack
ahead of schedule.
U.S. Air Force, Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOPII)
Roof heliport, PM's Office
- Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, MOP II, direct hit.
Iki, Ministry of Defense Secretary
- Target's injured. Confirmed bleeding!
This may work!
Way to go, U.S.A.
Mr. Prime Minister,
the helicopter is arriving soon.
A2 Exit, Akasaka 5-chome Station, Minato Ward
- Please take shelter underground.
Please go underground.
What's that light?
GSDF Rotary Wing Eurocopter EC-225LP
Transport Helicopter
Gojira's back seems to be glowing.
Further details unknown.
What is it doing?
There are no more
people out there.
Deputy chief, please get inside.
Highway 16, Fussa City
- There was an emergency call from Japan's airbase.
- U.S. Ambassador convoy in Japan
- B-2 number 1 seems to have been down.
Inside U.S. Ambassador official vehicle
- But there's no way.
That's impossible!
Godzilla.
Truly a god incarnate.
The target is shooting some
unidentified weapon from the front.
Bomber 2 and Bomber 3
will circle in from behind.
Payback time.
Roger.
Payback.
1853, taking off from official residence,
together with PM, 9 people to Tachikawa...
Hamamatsucho, Minato Ward
Shimbashi, Minato Ward
Ginza 4th Street intersection, Chuo Ward
Toranomon, Minato Ward
Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda Ward
Nagatacho, Chiyoda Ward
Tokyo Station, Chiyoda Ward
Expecting high levels of radiation
to be leaking,
people are to standby and
remain indoors for at least 49 hours.
How much radiation has
Gojira released in Tokyo?
Don't count on the government...
It has been proven high level
of radiation is leaking.
Please do not enter the right side
of the yellow warning tapes...
Too many subjects to be
tested for radiation.
Regarding this disastrous radiation situation,
Nuclear, biological and chemical response
teams are being deployed.
For decontamination and rescue.
The Prime Minister, Cabinet Secretary
and 5 ministers have gone missing.
Police headquarters and
Ministry of Internal Affairs still remains.
In the city there are millions
of homeless people.
Government officials are hoping to
avoid a political vacuum.
An acting Prime Minister will be
selected among the Party members.
Presently, Kanto's situation
as been deemed as urgent.
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention
Base, Provisional HQ - Temporary command
center has been set up at Tachikawa
where the team can discuss about
Tachikawa's emergency issues.
Deputy Chief Yaguchi!
I'll call back.
Mr. Izumi.
I'm glad you're safe.
To think that going home
on Friday saved me.
Yaguchi, you must
take care of yourself too.
You're hurt.
You all right?
Sorry. We were unable to
acquire any medical supplies.
That's okay.
It's not a big deal.
Notify the Fire and rescue department,
Ministry of Internal Affairs
is still not functionable.
Let the police handle it.
Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ Operation Room
- Have them survive for one night.
I can't imagine the pressure
from the public.
Have our press department
take care of it quickly.
Provisional HQ Staff Room
- In short, I need information. Where's Gojira now?
It's still at the Tokyo Station.
Who knows why.
Hows the radiation situation?
Nothing from the Nuclear station.
The city now is now
in a state of waste.
Compare to what's coming out
from Gojira's mouth...
this trace amount is nothing.
Hisamatsu, Nation-First Party Deputy
Chairman Public Secretary - The highly
concentrated material spewing from it's mouth
is spreading over the sea.
The 3 wards that came under direct attack,
I'm afraid the air there has been contaminated.
The problem might become more severe.
The situation has turn from urgent
to super urgent.
We lack manpower, materials
and legal infrastructure.
That can't be helped.
The Prime Minister, Chief Cabinet
Secretary, everybody's gone.
Don't go to pieces!
Presently, those who remains
must also do their best!
Yaguchi.
Calm yourself first.
I'm sorry.
Has the acting Prime Minister
been elected yet?
Evacuation center (Unoshima Elementary Gym),
Kazo City, Saitama - Due to the situation in the city,
Agriculture Minister, Yusuke Satomi,
has been appointed as Acting Prime Minister.
Presently the government is not
functioning if full capacity
resulting in the situation in
the emergency shelters.
- Evacuation center (Nishi-nakamachi public center),
Isesaki City, Gunma - To prevent any further calamity
a new cabinet will be
named immediately.
Giant Unidentified Creature Response Task Force HQ
- So a man with factional seniority,
Giant Unidentified Creature Response Task Force HQ
- and whose loyalty made him a minister,
is now the Prime Minister.
I hear it was foisted on him
by the party secretary.
Who wants the responsibility
at a time like this?
- Director's Office, Special Disaster Bureau
Provisional HQ, Tachikawa City - Right now, there's
some disturbing movement near Tsushima Island.
- Director's Office, Special Disaster Bureau
Provisional HQ, Tachikawa City - there's
something going on Tsushima Island.
I see.
Kazakoshi, Executive Secretary to the Prime Minister
- We'll have to wait and see about this.
Is Foreign Ministry functionable?
Katayama, Acting Foreign Affairs Minister
- It is still getting organized.
I see.
At any rate, just try to avoid
unforeseen surprises.
Yes, sir.
I'll let the ambassador know.
Yusuke Satomi, Acting Prime Minister
- Ah, the noodles got soggy.
I knew this job wouldn't be easy.
Satomi is a hard man to read.
Whoever is the Prime Minister,
our job's to keep the ship afloat.
We need an emergency legislation.
And uh, we're only 30 kilometers from
where Gojira's sleeping, is that okay?
I'm not worried about that anymore.
This country's good at
quickly picking a successor.
You next?
No way.
I'm thinking 10 years.
If Japan's still around, run for office.
I'll support you... in exchange
for a party secretary post.
Akasaka was at Yokota,
so he was saved.
A politician needs strategy and luck.
Now he's Chief Cabinet Secretary.
You could be more ambitious.
The Disaster Bureau is a unique path, though...
You're practically in charge.
- Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Director, Cabinet Minister
of State for Special Missions & Giant Unidentified
Creature Unified Response Task Force HQ Bureau
Chief - No, I'm here to take the fall, if needed.
Akasaka's a shrewd delegator.
You're the next new aide
to the PM on a career track.
What's wrong with that?
Why did you become a politician?
'Couse it's either friend or foe.
I like the simplicity.
Deputy chief,
the Bureau members have arrived.
Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ Office 3
It's great to see you all.
Over half of our team has returned.
Thank you so much.
Regrettably, our hearts are heavy
for those we lost.
Let's do it for them.
We'll fill their positions.
While we struggle
with the lost of colleagues
and loved ones.
That's why we will prevail!
For our countrymen.
I ask you to pour heart
and soul into completing our work.
Please.
Okay, let's get to work!
- Alright. - Okay.
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base
Preliminary conference room
- Manager Mori.
- Yeah.
How's the freeze plan coming along?
Still no complete data on Gojira
We still need to collect
from the citizens in the city,
24 blood samples.
I hope this helps.
Hows our progress now?
- Hiromi Ogashira, Ministry of the Environment
Deputy Chief, Wildlife Division
- We've asked GSDF to retrieve some living cells for us.
GSDF Nuclear,
Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle
Roger that.
Sample retrieval, done.
Please send them to BSL4 labs.
Okay.
Remainder samples to be sent
to any P3 level labs.
But these are government-classified secrets,
it that appropriate?
It's alright.
I just need some scientific info on Gojira.
No change in radiation levels.
It's still below 1 Sievert.

Something's up.
Yaguchi here.
It's me.
Arriving in 5 minutes.
Please secure a meeting
with the acting PM.
Are you saying the U.S. wish to
assist Japan in it's crisis?
Is that right?
Yes. There's a movement
centered on China and Russia,
to take Godzilla from under the
control of the Japanese government
and put it under the control
of international organizations.
Many countries are aligned
with that opinion, too.
However, as for the U.S. government,
we strongly hope
that Japan and the U.S. can
perfectly control Godzilla together.
Hideki Akasaka, Acting Chief Cabinet Secretary
(Former Aide to the Prime Minister) - Okay.
From the government's point of view,
it is for that reason that we would
agree to a 2-plus 2 cooperation.
However, as army experts will remain
as the backbone of the government.
We have to respectfully decline your offer
to remain at the center of decision-making.
In place of that, we will...
A U.S.-Japan Gojira research coalition?
That'd be good, isn't it?
The more knowledge, the better.
Lets clear some space.
U.S. GODZILLA Joint Research Team
- Nice to meet you. I'm Rando Yaguchi.
This image is from GSDF's latest
unmanned surveillance system.
It was inoperative soon
after it was attacked.
Same as the D2 simulation.
Richter, Joint Research Team Leader
- Just as I thought...
It appears that Godzilla has something
like a built in phased-array radar.
So it can instinctively intercept
approaching objects. No doubt about it.
U.S. air strike grounds, Minato Ward
GSDF First Special Weapons Defense Unit
- Squad 2, this is CV1.
5 minutes from zero mark.
10 minutes remain. Over.
CV1, Squad 2, copy that.
According to the situation
in the areas
and the field data from Tsukuba,
this could be Gojira's cell propagation.
Soon rapidly spreading to the whole world.
If it continues to evolve
instead of become smaller,
it could sprout wings and
fly to other continents.
Let's go
And that will mark
the end of the human race.
Before that happens, using our nuclear wisdom
is the only road for salvation for mankind.
Are you serious?
Tama Monorail Operation Base, Tachikawa City, Tokyo
Washington's Defense Secretary
has ordered a strike... No,
It clearly means to use
thermonuclear weapon against Gojira.
And the White House?
The possibility of Gojira
coming ashore is 13 %
has been reported to the President.
United Nations has set up
a multinational Gojira strike force.
The U.S. is serious?
Afraid so.
They have decided to
deploy nuclear missiles.
The Pentagon's has gotten
ready B83 warhead
and an explosion team
Just like that, on Tokyo?
I was ordered to evacuate.
I see.
So it's highly likely,
isn't it?
Yes.
But I'm not going back.
The bombing that caused
my grandmother's tragedy,
I don't want to see it happen
the 3rd time to my motherland.
Japan-U.S. heads of state conference call
- Certainly. We will act accordingly, President Ross.
Matsuzawa, Minister of Foreign Affairs - Certainly,
we will act accordingly that way, President Ross.
Well, you heard it.
That country foists some
crazy things to us.
Even so.
This decision is unacceptable1
I agree.
Get the Chief Cabinet Secretary.
Yes, sir.
We've decided to let the U.S.
to lead an operation to attack
the giant unidentified creature.
To exterminate it.
As party to the resolution and participant...
our nation will be
under U.S. command.
In other words...
I'm going to declare
a special law
to support this decision.
Authorizing...
the use of a nuclear weapon
on Tokyo?
I didn't want to go down
in history for anything like this.
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster
Prevention Base rooftop
From here on, Gojira comes
under U.S.-led, UN jurisdiction.
Post-War Japan is a tributary state.
"Post-War" extends forever...
That why you mustn't give up.
No creature can withstand
the million-degree heat of a nuke.
As a sure method of extermination,
it's the right choice.
But we're on the edge
of a breakthrough...
with our freezing method.
Your plan still has too many unknowns.
Plus, all countries have
pledged their support.
To a complete rebuilding effort
if we sign on.
If we can't kill Gojira
with certainty...
...Japan will lose the world's trust.
We must put our fate
in the UN's hands.
My job is to think about
what to do for Japan
after Gojira has been destroyed.
Right now Tokyo's damage is
limited to three wards.
They can be rebuilt.
The city's economy is in a free fall.
If bonds and stocks continue to plummet...
The nation will go into transgression.
Japan needs international
sympathy and funding.
Scrap and build, huh?
To save the country.
There's no other way.
Yaguchi.
This is the reality.
All else is just a dream.
Huh?
An thermonuclear attack on Gojira?
Dropped here?
The Prime Minister has just sanctioned it
and informed the UN.
Unbelievable.
There's a possibility that
Gojira can still evolve.
Not able to die
is a possibility too.
Therefore it's either incinerate with a nuke,
or Yaguchi's freezing plan.
Yes, there's a choice.
But not a good one.
What's more frightening than Gojira
is us, humans.
The United Nations will not
attack out of sudden,
first, they have to consider
evacuation for the civilians.
That's our window
to set up the plan.
You're right.
We've confirmed some substance
that worked well on the samples.
It's just production now.
Estimating the amount
of blood in Gojira,
we'll need at least
672 kiloliters of coagulant.
I've already requested support from
nationwide plant facilities.
Can we make it?
We have to make it!
Let us...
protect this country till the end.
Ask every private chemical company
in our nation
operate all the lines to make it in time.
I beg you.
I'll send over all pertinent data.
Please ask everyone to finish
production by tomorrow.
Thanks to them,
we've collected loads of data.
There is no doubt
the more knowledge the better.
Notify the police and MLIT
the transportation of the coagulant.
I'll do that.
I need METI to coordinate
with the pump making plants.
If we agree to buy them...
Shanghai agree to
give us 3 tank trucks.
Size doesn't matter,
we need 5 more wheel loaders.
This report just came in.
According to Gojira's energy recovery rate,
it is estimated that
it would be restored to the
original level within 360 hours.
Shuichi Izumi, Acting Special Adviser
to the Prime Minister - That's to say,
Gojira will resume activity in 15 days.
I see.
U.S. Forces Japan Yokota Air Base Command HQ,
Fussa City - A charter home will be leaving in an hour.
All remaining staff,
prepare to leave immediately.
Cartland, U.S. Army Colonel - The start time for the
nuclear strike against Godzilla has been decided.
Countdown will begin in 5 minutes.
Paine, U.S. Forces Commander
- So, it's too late to turn back now.
Lansing, U.S. Ambassador to Japan - Japan has
been given a two-week grace period in order to...
evacuate remaining residents.
That may seem long for the Allied Forces,
but it's too short for Japan.
Evacuation means uprooting people
from their beloved homes.
- Don't make it sound so easy.
- You're right.
To evacuate 3.6 million people immediately?
That's preposterous!
It's too big a problem for
the police manpower.
Including Chiba and Kanagawa Prefecture,
the evacuation area is simply too big.
The governor too
is against sacrificing Tokyo.
This is a national decision, it's already
not something the governor can decide.
But we time for relocation selection
and approvals,
it can't happen in 2 weeks.
The moment the giant unidentified creature
resumes activity,
there would be unrestricted
usage of nuclear strikes.
By then there would be
countless victims.
The UN has decided and has began planning
for the launch of thermonuclear warheads.
Bastards,
just because we are an Asian country.
If it were New York here,
they would have come up
with the same decision.

Showa Memorial Park, Tachikawa City, Tokyo
- Land prices are soaring in west Japan. Food is short.
Kanto area companies
and shops are shuttered.
The City is full of the unemployed.
The yen's plunge reflects investor fears...
...except from those profiting from it.
People come in all forms.
Do you have any new information?
I do.
It's my job after all.
How about printing my article a day
prior to the bomb drop?
New information on Gojira.
In exchange, we control
the announcement timing.
How's that?
Okay, okay, I understand.
The professor loathed the radiation
sickness that took his wife's life.
So he went into research to render
radioactive materials harmless.
If radioactive materials
could be rendered harmless
so is the creation of
new radioactive materials.
Either one being militarized
is horrifying.
That explains his redacting the DOE data.
He hated radioactive materials.
And so he hated people
who are researching it.
Including Japan, which left his wife to die.
Then he leaves his data and writes,
"Do as you like"?
Strange guy.
So what did he want to do
in the end?
Thank you for the meal.
Solve the problem yet?
Not without the help from the
Intelligence ministry and a cryptographer.
Anything from the U.S.?
I've stopped relying on them.
Forget about them right now.
Although we've grasped
Gojira's primary data,
but we still don't know
what's the next step.
It resembles a mandala more than
a chemical schematic.
We can't think of an answer
if we can't think of a question.
Professor Maki is really a handful.
I'm even baffled by it's simple lines.
Why isn't it data
but paper instead?
It resembles folding lines.
And to maintain such a large body...
the initial radioactive waste consumed
wouldn't be enough now.
No doubt.
With such teeth, it can eat
any nuclear weapons, huh?
Origami.
It's not eaten.
Through origami,
we've gotten new information.
We've used all the analytic methods,
here's what we gathered.
We're too focused on the
radioactive material as it's energy.
This is a molecular chart for
converting elements in the body.
Element conversion molecules.
First of all, the unknown
radioactive isotope is the proof.
Say hydrogen or nitrogen entering the cell...
where it's converted to necessary molecules.
Gojira is a mixotroph with an
organ that converts decaying heat.
A bold but viable hypothesis.
It can survive anywhere
with water or oxygen.
Like an ascetic's way of living.
So Gojira's is not only
a threat to mankind's survival...
but also poses a revelation
of limitless material potential.
Since it has such living cells
then the blood coagulant may be
ineffective inside it's body
killing the Yaguchi Plan.
Possibly.
So what now?
There're no other plans.
We raise certainty of working on the Yaguchi plan.
First, analyze this structure,
then a way around it.
Our supercomputers are already
running parallel analysis...
but who knows how many days
that would take.
We've only got 10 days left.
That's why I've asked MEXT
to seek for global help.
Burghead, Computer Science Laboratory
- Call from Japan.
They're requesting parallel analysis
on the Gojira's cell structure.
We can't.
This is a closed system.
If we open up to other nations,
we risk our research data being stolen.
Come, come.
Where's your trust in your fellow men?
Tell them we'd be happy to do it!
Supercomputer cluster
Profess Maki's data analysis is done!
Quickly.
How is it?
- Here.
- Excuse me.
Incredible.
In other words,
it's not the cell membrane itself.
But an extremophile configuration
that inhibit's cell membrane activity.
This inhibitor could keep
the blood coagulant viable.
There's still hope.
It looks good.
Okay.
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base rooftop
- Professor Maki has already anticipated this incident.
Maybe he's using this
destructive God as a test...
on mankind, this country,
we Japanese.
"Do as you like", including the use of
nuclear weapons.
I see.
"Do as you please", huh?
But...
that's hard to do in this country.
Yeah.
If it's by myself.
Mr. Prime Minister, we're ironing out
the last kinks on the Yaguchi Plan.
We ask your approval to deploy it.
But Izumi...
A UN resolution is already passed.
Some say that the U.S.
seeks a quick resolution
to bury their knowledge of Gojira.
We already knew that!
And you know our country's condition.
That's why, Mr. Prime Minister...
...forcing one country's sacrifice
for self-gain is deplorable.
So you're saying...
...act unilaterally on humanitarian principle.
Mr. Prime Minister,
perhaps it's time
you did as you wanted.
You're right.
So, where do I affix my stamp.
GSDF Reception Room,
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base
The goal is to immobilize the
giant unidentified creature
by administer a coagulate
to freeze it's blood operation.
It's so long-winded.
What's short for it?
Operation "Sudden strike Gojira"
seems too childish.
Let's call it "Operation Yashiori."
Very well.
The operation is split
into 5 phases.
Everything has checked out.
The integration of the army
and the amount of explosive usage
have been accounted.
What's left is deploying them.
Many thanks.
No need.
It's our job.
Countdown in 2 days, huh?
Damn.
They still need three days to
get the coagulant ready.
Any ideas to delay the countdown
for 24 hours?
Only the Council can
help to stall this?
Which country can help?
China and Russia are
too geopolitically close.
They rather proceed with
the plan than delay it.
How about France?
Nuclear powered countries.
They'd be interested in
Gojira's biology system.
I have a back channel to France.
I will do it discreetly.
Please do.
I'll try the Euro Bureau Chief.
Thank you.
And I will talk to Foreign Minister Katayama.
- Do whatever to get the 24 more hours!
- Understood. - Understood.
Chartered plane, U.S. Forces Japan
Yokota Air Base, Fussa City - France has
petitioned to interrupt the countdown.
Cussing, U.S. Official - China and Russia are opposed,
but we're maintaining silence.
That's because it isn't just hardliners at
the nucleus of Washington and the Pentagon.
Japan has grown up enough to have
international trade deals on the sly.
Danger in another opportunity
for personal growth.
Our friends are progressing with
an effective deep freeze plan.
I think this country
is betting on it.
And you're raising
that bet also, I see.
Nuclear weapons are a deterrent.
I've been trying to advise
Charles against it.
But, it goes against
the flow of the mainstream.
And you and I must bear
the risk of retaliation.
Me, I'm okay.
But you, with your fastidious career,
and the Patterson name,
mud will stick.
And your dream of becoming
President in your 40s will disappear.
Hey, Kayoko!
Good luck.
Yeah.
Science Museum roof, Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda Ward
- A joint U.S. operation?
Science Museum First Floor - Raise the chance
of success than the SDF working alone.
Can our independent commands
be coordinated?
You've made friends.
The Air Force and navy
are being deployed.
Even drones if you need it.
So, what do you say?
I'm in.
But there is no guarantee of
the coming back in one piece.
Of course.
I'll bill the Japanese government later.
SBPCPC Kanto Chemical Plant, Tsukuba City, Ibaraki
We scrapped together enough inhibitors.
Yeah.
Quickly send some tankers
to pick them up, I beg you.
Port of Kisarazu, Kisarazu City, Chiba Prefecture
The material and inhibitors here
are shippable and operation ready.
Give HQ the green light.
GSDF HQ, Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster
Prevention Base - Deputy chief, won't you
reconsider accompanying the front line troops?
To carry out an operation,
a political decision may be needed.
And time will be critical.
Even so, it's still too risky.
Policymakers should just
remain back at base.
You want to be PM in 10 years?
It's more important to make sure
this country is around in 10 years
than me being Prime Minister
in 10 years.
We've got officials and
many young talents.
Like you.
Having a leader is not a problem.
Thank you very much
for all your help.
No need for thanks.
It's all mentor Akasaka's instructions.
It's up to you next.
I'll deal with the Secretary.

We owe it to the acting PM who
worked relentlessly to convince France.
Morelli, French Ambassador to Japan
Excuse me!
Please look at this survey data.
Gojira's new isotope has
a half-life of 20 days.
It'll be halved in a month,
gone in 2, 3 years.
Yeah.
That's good news for Tokyo residents.
That's wonderful.
GSDF Nerima Base, Nerima Ward
Good work.
Soon, the Satomi cabinet will be
resigning en masse.
In line with your scenario?
It wasn't mine.
This was all PM Satomi's scenario.
The capital and government
are are in shambles.
It's time to rebuild it right.
After the provisional government has passed
the bill regarding giant unidentified creatures
and established the layout
of rebuilding Tokyo,
it will dissolve for general election.
The rebuilding of Japan and 3.6 million evacuees...
will require a brand new cabinet.
This country has gone through
one scrap-and-build.
It will be done again.
The countdown was merely suspended.
But it will restart when
Gojira starts to move.
3,526 seconds to launching.
I'm amazed you allowed that.
If I don't,
the world will not feel safe.
Japan...
No.
Mankind must coexist with Gojira.
You shared the data with France, right?
Not only with France,
shared with the whole world too.
I broke a promise,
but regret nothing.
I like your by-any-means approach.
So...
Don't quit.
When I'm U.S. President,
it would be great if you,
Yaguchi, is the Prime Minister.
Your ideal puppet, huh?
No matter what the result is,
too many people has sacrificed.
Taking accountability is the politician's job.
The form in which the politician take
responsibility is the devotion of self.
I will respond to my responsibility.
Well,
as Maki said,
"Do as you like."
But now's not the time to quit.
This thing is far
from being over.
