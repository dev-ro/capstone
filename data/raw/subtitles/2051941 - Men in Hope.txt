(Escalating music)
(Opening theme music)
-Are you waiting long? -Just a moment longer
and the warranty of these gifts expires.
We should've been there already.
Alice will eat me alive.
Don't worry about that.
After all, you know her.
She would have complained about the delay
even on the death trains.
-Where were you so long?
-''Where were you?''With you of course.
So I should cover for you again?
It is not over with that female guide yet?
-No. She just had a surgery.
Poor thing, cannot even stretch
her leg properly.
I see that you would regret that.
-But how about that chick who brings her groceries.
-Chick...? -Hmmm.
Those legs. Lovely.
Those would get you too.
Hardly. Unlike you, I do
realize that I am married,
and that this entails certain obligations.
Ondrej... did you know that a customer
died here last week?
-Here in the car?
-Yeah. Exactly there, where you sit.
Such a happy guy. We're driving,
chatting. I was telling him a story...
and suddenly I look - and he is dead.
That must've been a hell of a story.
You better keep it to yourself.
Sudden heart failure. At thirty-five.
And what about me?
With the gallbladder issues, high blood
pressure and prostate problems?
No time to waste time, buddy.
-Well ... I agree.
-There you go.
So I can count on you, right?
Rudolf, I'm sorry,
but you know that I can't lie.
''I can't lie.''
My God, what kind of idiot
did my girl marry?
(Joyful music theme)
Hi, honey.
I know, we're a bit late, but...
41 minutes! You call that a bit?
Oh well... thank you very much.
Well, guys!
-Hey! -Hi.
-What kept you?
-What can I say?
I went to see my mistress.
She had a meniscus surgery, you know?
So I helped her with rehabilitation a little.
And then this young samaritan-like
girl appeared there. Beautiful woman.
She wanted to meet me too.
So that delayed me a bit.
Well what could I have done?
She was ompletely crazy about me.
If you just stopped bragging.
They were playing pool.
Look.
He still has chalk on his fingers.
I don't get why you enjoy doing this...
...making stuff up at your age.
And now try talking her out of it.
We will go play with some balls again
on Friday, right?
-Absolutely.
-At six, exactly.
(happy theme music)
Just like Grandpa.
(Shouts and sighs)
Dad, Grandma and Grandpa are fighting?
-No, they are play a game...a board game.
-Something like''Ludo'', right?
Well...
More like,''Jumping hats''.
Can't your parents control their
passion at least a little bit?
-How should I explain this to Pavlík
all the time? -Normal. That they love each other.
And won't it be strange, then, that
he doesn't hear such noises from us too?
We can top them easily,
if you want.
Wait, I thought,
you were mad at me.
That can be postponed.
Ovulation cannot be.
So don't drag around.
Hey, but if you're
still angry,
you don't have to push it.
I mean ...
I don't want to force you.
It might work out today. I have perfect
temperature and density of the secretion.
(''Short''sly musical theme)
Now I'm so turned on.
(Short humorous musical theme)
Isn't is a completely different feeling when you
know there can be a baby? -Hmm.
If we hurry,
I could give birth in the spring
and avoid
that terrible summer heat.
We'll repaint the back room
and rearrange the furniture, right?
Oh hey, I made a few sketches.
Nice.
-Mom had knit him little outfits.
-Yeah.
Which hat do you like more?
-Done yet?
-No, cramp!
Look how we ended up.
Female dictatorship.
My friend, when my grandfather came
from working outside with dirty shoes
he went straight to the table, no one
dared to say a word. Such a respect.
Look at us.
Slaves!
-What is waiting for this little one?
-Ouch! There ...!
-Pavlik, defend yourself!
After all, that scooter is yours.
- (Girl is screaming)
-What is it? Leave her alone!
Why would you hit a girl?
You should be ashamed!
-Is he yours?
-Why don't you watch him?
-Or try to raise him better?
-Yeah! -Oh! What do you expect from men, right?
We're not all the same.
You collaborator!
Well you did it, Pavlik. When
dealing with females, you must be strict and clever.
(Ondrej sighs)
-What is it? -My back is hurting.
We are working on that baby.
-'Working?' Isn't that a joy?
- Tell that to your daughter.
If she doesn't get pregnant soon,
I will end up crippled.
Easy for you to laugh. Not
everybody is half a mountain goat like you.
I have to say,
your appetite amazes me.
-Why? Is there a problem with you?
-No, but ...
With all those women in your life I
wonder how you still want her.
So what?
You must have seen her naked a thousand times.
Doesn't it get boring?
-Are you mad? I haven't seen her
naked in at least twenty years. -What?
That would be a suicide,
it would kill my vibe instantly.
So how you do it, get turned on?
-Do you have any idea about how many
beautiful women are out there? -So what?
I watch and record it right here.
Like a videocamera.
And then when it's needed
I find it later.
I then I can easily
march into the bedroom
and when it comes to that, I close my
eyes and turn on the autopilot.
And here I see the pictures I want.
And the body does what it's gotta do.
My friend, I make love to so
many women in one night,
more than most guys manage in a lifetime.
You see those legs?
Well. They are quite nice.
Quite nice?
Amazing!
These will come in handy again.
(main musical theme, energic)
-That's all for today?
-Yeah ... I guess.
"I guess?" Are you an accountant?
I came to this restaurant so I did
not have to be an accountant anymore.
I wanted to cook.
I wanted to be a chef.
-Now I'm doing everything ... except for cooking.
-Because only the chef hasn't left us yet.
We didn't do so well with the rest.
Why do you think nobody comes here?
Ondrej. Ondrej, I know that
you enjoy cooking, but you're just an amateur.
While Louis is a pro.
Moreover, he is a native Frenchman.
A native Frenchman? His mother went into
labor during a stopover in Paris, that's all.
It is some ordinary Ludek, Czech guy.
He wouldn't even be able to order in France.
Let alone be allowed into the kitchen.
- (Ondrej): Hello.
- (Guests): Hello.
-What would you recommend?
-Do you want to have a really good meal?
So change the restaurant.
What are you doing here?
I'm warming up.
-You said on Friday at six, right?
-That was just a cover-up.
-Alibi for the women, right?
-And how do I know?
So what do you think this is? (wink)
Nervous tics?
-You have to explain that it's a code.
-My God, you're really stupid.
(The main musical theme; surreptitiously)
-Hi.
-Good evening.
Evening.
This is arlota, this is Ondrej, my son-in-law.
The one with the sore back?
And you're probably the one that carries groceries
to helpless patiens...?
Not anymore. It was just
a civil penalty.
-Penalty -Hmm. -For what?
Public scandal.
Such bullshit.
That fountain is nonetheless public, isn't it?
So why shouldn't we take a swim in it
with my girls?
And can we swim in clothes?
Perhaps I shouldn't drink so much.
Absinthe for Miss. Double.
For me, too. Thank you.
The one with the sore back?
You discuss my private life with her?
I wanted to make her laugh.
We laughed a lot.
Well I'm glad.
Water for me, please.
-Come on! You want to stay here?
-Of course. I will not leave you here alone.
You could do something stupid,
that you will regret.
-That girl could be your granddaughter.
-Hardly.
First I'd have to have something with
her grandmother. I'd remember that.
If she was half
as pretty as she is.
And what do you wanna get her on?
The liver spots?
Women love the swarthy types.
If you don't think about Marta
mind at least your blood pressure.
-She could seriously mess with it.
-Ah well! The doctor recommends exercise.
Did you see that body?
This is something! And she's a dancer.
Can you imagine the possibilities?
I can't. And don't even want to.
-Yeah, sorry, I forgot.
You're actually married. And, happily.
And Alice is, too?
-What? Did she complain?
She doesn't have to. Just look at her.
Nonsense!
I will do anything she wishes for.
Exactly.
A woman must fight for you,
she has to try.
She wants a real man, not some
kind of a domesticated idiot.
Boring, buddy.
When a woman gets bored it is bad.
And as I'm watching it,
Alice is beginning to get bored.
Why do you think
she wants that kid so much?
So you think it'd be best if I cheated
and lied to her like you do with Marta, right?
Well you could at least try.
A well-done infidelity can
save many relationships.
Look at that chick,
smiling at you.
She's good, isn't she?
I must've heard you wrong. You're
convincing me to cheat on your own daughter!
So what? You're doing it for your own good.
You should try harder.
Oh! So you cheat on Marta
purely due to her well-being, right?
Of course.
I'm not selfish.
I see.
Me and Marta have been together for 35
years. Did she ever seem unhappy?
(Sprightly musical theme)
-Missed again.
-Don't worry about that, arlota.
It's the hair.
Keeps falling into my eyes.
Better, isn't it?
Much better.
-It's so cold, huh?
-Take that off.
There you go.
Thank you.
You are so attentive... for a cab driver.
I am not a cab driver.
-I drive only for a few months.
-Ever since he retired.
I'm still too young to be,
sitting at home all day, right?
It also has other advantages...
such as night rides.
Well so...
I, originally, was a designer
of rides.
Those death rides in amusement parks.
All over the world.
The first ride I designed is not far from
here, Would you like to go take a look?
-That's where he met his wife.
They are still together. -That's true.
She was awesome back then already.
I needed volunteers for the
first ride.
Nobody wanted to go.
Only she had the courage.
So we went alone. She was crushing my hand
the whole time, screaming like crazy.
And now, imagine.
The ride stopped.
...and she said,
she wants to go again. Now!
I promised her that if she stays with me,
her whole life will be that exciting.
-I assume you kept your promise.
-You bet I did.
-(central locks beep)
-And what about you?
Would you have the courage
to try it with me as well?
We'll see. Maybe it would be worth it.
Let's go then.
Do you want to sit in front or in the back?
He can't come with us... Unfortunately.
Has things to do at home
And they are urgent, aren't they?
-Good night then.
-Good night.
-You can get home from here, right?
-Yea...
(thunder)
It's a huge storm out there.
I'm entirely wet.
-Dad didn't give you a ride?
-No, he did not.
He was in the middle of playing.
He wanted to finish it, so I had to walk.
I bet I have a fever.
This will not measure your temperature, darling.
It's a pregnancy test.
-Negative again, right?
-Yes, again. This is weird.
The doctor said
I am absolutely healthy.
-The question is, whether you are.
-What...what? Me?
If you want that baby too,
you have to cooperate.
What do you mean, "cooperate"?
-You are late. -We are sorry,
we had to talk about it still.
-We're closing in 10 minutes. -10 minutes?
He will have plenty of time left. Right?
(electric light buzzing)
(''wild'' variation
of the main musical theme)
(arlota speaking with Alice's voice):
Are you done yet? Ondrej?
They really have to go now...
(sad musical theme)
(door squeaks)
Hello.
-Did you wipe the tables?
-Yes. -And chairs?
-An hour ago. -Then wipe them again.
-Why? Nobody sat there.
Maybe they didn't, because they weren't wiped.
Alice, are you happy with me?
-What kind of question is that? -Normal.
I'd like to know whether you're happy with me.
I don't have time for games. I'm going to
beg the bank, so they wouldn't close this down yet.
Don't forget the chairs.
(short mystical theme)
Good evening.
Do you remember me?
I do...I do.
-I actually just thought of you.
-Really? What reminded you of me?
Uh, well...
-Would you like anything to eat?
-I'm starving.
-But I guess you are closing already?
-What would you like to eat?
Surprise me.
Ludek?
Ludek.
Louisi?
You can go home now.
Nobody will come anyway.
Those are some skillful hands.
Like a magician.
I taught myself.
Still an amateur though.
But dedicated!
I like it.
-Smells really good.
-It's an old family recipe.
My sisters caught my brothers-in-law on this meal.
No wonder.
It's working on me too.
It's fantastic.
How come this place isn't packed with people?
It hasn't been here long. It's off the main road.
I'm surprised you found it.
-Rudolf described the way really well.
-Yeah.
You came here for him.
No. I came to see you.
Really?
I owe you that jacket.
There's no hurry.
You could've just given in to Rudolf.
That way I wouldn't be able to see you.
(music theme; starts out romantic,
goes into passionate rhythm)
Of course I forgot it at home.
I live just a few minutes away.
So if you'd like to pick it up...
yourself...?
-That was amazing.
-Yeah...
-Even better than I imagined.
-You have imagined this? -Hmm.
From the first moment.
Why do you think I was provoking
you so much when we played pool?
I thought
that was for Rudolf.
He is nice, but
he is a little...
-Old? -No, I don't mind that.
I've had older.
-Really?
-Mhm.
I had to resurrect
him a bit.
-and give him CPR,
but he survived. -Mhm.
Rudolf is a little too self-confident for me.
I like "dorks" more.
well thanks.
(yells)
-But then they turn into a beast like this
-Such exaggeration.
She is not exaggerating. I haven't heard
her going at it like this in a while.
That's Bára. She lives here with me.
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.
You...have you been around here from the beginning?
-No, we got here in the middle... -That's Irene.
-...but we didn't want to interrupt.
That's nice of you.
(music theme)
We haven't seen each other since high
school and I run into him on the street!
We had to go get a drink.
-I hope you didn't drink too much.
-Nah, you know me.
Not even 3 little shots.
Uh...
-And is he gay?
-Why do you ask?
He uses such a sweet perfume.
I can smell it from your jacket.
No...the opposite...
Pepa loves women...
You know, they always rub themselves
on him, so he smells like all sweet...
There was hugging, shoulder tapping,
I might have caught some of that smell.
-So when are you going to see him again?
-I don't know.
We didn't plan anything.
Aha.
I think, you definitely
should see each other again.
because he probably really wants that.
Why would he leave this "business card"
in your pocket otherwise?
-Alice, don't overreact. I can explain.
-I'm all ears.
I don't want to hear any explanations.
Rudolf, don't explain!
Mar...
Marta, don't be mad. Marta...
You can take this with you!
Don't even try. I won't support your
little adventures. Forget that!
Alice!
Alice, you can't let him sleep
in the shed. He is 63.
He should've thought of that
before he started chasing that girl.
-It's your dad.
-Exactly. How could he do that to mom?
What kind of example is this for Pavlik,
when you kick his grandpa out like this?
Let him see
what happens to a manwhore.
Ah...
If you want to be on his side
just go now then.
(short musical theme)
Here is a blanket and some food.
I don't want anything from a tattletail.
Rudolf, I'm sorry.
-What was I supposed to tell her?
-Something, dammit. Anything.
-You should've made something up.
-Easy for you to say.
I was completely naked and she had a scissor
this big! You wouldn't know what to do either.
Talent for interrogation.
She inherited that from her mom.
However, her mother never
managed to get anything out of me.
My friend,
I've kept a clean record for 35 years.
And now this. Because of you.
So embarrassing.
-Especially since I didn't have anything with that girl.
-I know.
-How do you know? What?
-You would have bragged, wouldn't you?
Well anyway
If my wife believes I had something with
a creature that can fit into this,
-then that's nice, isn't it?
-Well yeah.
These yellow ones are for his gallblader.
And you put these drops into his eyes
before he leaves for work.
-Without these he goes blind in a few hours.
-I won't put any drops into his eyes.
I am pretty mad at him.
You should be too!
Here is a warm sweater for him.
He will catch a pneumonia in that shirt.
Mom, he is chasing some chick
and you bring sweaters for him?
-Why would you kick him out then?
-So he knows he's in trouble! He definitely is!
But if I were to worry about each
one of his flings
-I'd be all worn out by now.
-There was more of this?
138.
(Marta): Counting the last one too? 139.
I knew about each one of them.
Oh, he tried so hard to
cover everything.
He was going to take one to a sea. He'd
been going to the solarium for a month prior.
So I wouldn't think it's weird if
he suddenly got a tan...
How come you
always figured it out?
That dumbass took pictures of them.
What? You know their faces?
Oh, if it was faces...
Vladana. From Loda.
She was such an inspiration.
Hang on...
this is the curve of her hip,
and the circle... that's her bellybutton.
Oh yes. Ulrika. From Dresden.
I wanted to build two bumps
like her boobs
But nobody'd take that kind of overload.
But still, that ride was pretty wild.
Too bad Marta never wanted to try it.
That's what I was always a little sad about.
She never asked:
''What are you working on?''
''I'd like to go with you.''
-What is this?
-Well...
That's Lubica. From Zagreb.
I ran out of tape, you know.
So I sat her into
a little bit of dirt.
Then I waited for it to dry.
I glazed it nicely
Brought it home
I told Marta it was ceramics
She loved it.
She had it on a shelf in
the livingroom for a long time.
Then I had to put it away because
when she was cleaning and shining it
it turned me on like mad.
And you forgave him all that?
Not at all!
But what was I supposed to do?
Destroy our family?
Take your dad away from you?
-You loved him so much.
-Yes, until today.
Well, well, well...
It's just a man. What do you expect?
He has a compass between his legs,
showing him direction. It's not his fault.
Besides, he was always flying all over the world.
I couldn't compete with that.
Do you know what makes me more sad
than all these women combined?
He never said
''Marta, come with me!
So I can show you
what did I build!
Come, so you can see it all.
So you can hear, how everyone screams
with fear and joy. Come with me!''
He never said that.
He didn't care much about my opinion.
-You should've twist that compass right off.
-Come on, that would be a waste.
It's been so much fun.
And it still is. Still.
You see that, don't you.
I still have to watch out, just so
some other woman doesn't lure him away. Still.
And all those infidelities
had their advantages.
There is no man more attentive
than the one feeling guilty.
Do you think a man would buy
you a Valentino purse just like that?
If he didn't feel guilty?
-He got you a Valentino purse?
-Not yet. But he will.
You know which one?
I showed it to you the other day.
Once you're giving him those eye drops
just mention it inconspicuously.
-Mom, you're letting him buy you back this cheap?
-Cheap?
Do you know how expensive that purse is?
That's almost like prostitution.
Come on, Alice!
Is this how you talk to your mother?
Those bitches are
pushing our prices down.
In the end, it's not important which
woman is he chasing.
but which one he comes back to.
(lively music theme)
(dynamic music theme)
-Hello.
-Hi.
I've got something for you.
You forgot it in my son-in-law's
jacket after we played pool the other day.
-My daughter found it.
-Is he in trouble?
He is not, I am.
I took it upon myself.
-So it's been hell at home.
-I am really sorry. -Me too.
Especially because
nothing really happened.
So I'm thinking if I got punished
for it, whether it should happen.
-That would be fair... -Yea...
-But I just met somebody.
This fast?
Well then, when you
find out what an idiot he is, let me know.
You'll be the first to know.
(music theme)
(exotic drums)
Hey! Give it back!
Somebody stop them! Assholes!
Do you hear me? Give it back!
Idiots.
Can't tell,
what's actually valuable.
(music theme)
(honking)
-Hi.
-Hey.
You don't call, don't show up,
I had to call you up this way.
-You still remember where I live, right?
-Yes.
Okay.
You really won't come upstairs?
My leg is much better. Look.
I'm glad. So you can get upstairs
by yourself, right?
Of course.
(sad music theme)
(phone rings)
I'm glad it wasn't on too much heat
otherwise you'd lose that ear.
That's what I call a hotline.
What did you need anyway?
You didn't open your curtains all day.
I wanted to know if you're okay.
I was...
...until you called.
Strainer.
Do you know where mom used to keep the strainer?
There you go.
I'll help you clean up.
Don't even start with that.
You've got plenty yourself.
Then I'll find a maid for you.
Just for cleaning.
-You can come eat with us.
-That's okay. I'm fine.
Yea.
You should lower the drinking.
You're making me
seem like an alcoholic.
-When Ondrej made Coq au vin, you
ate almost all the sauce. -Well...
Dad, you can't go on like this!
Can't live in a dungeon.
Pavlík had asked about you. He said
you promised to help him build a plane.
I'm working on that.
Or you can go play pool
with Ondrej, like last time.
You know how that went last time.
Well then take one of those
you know...your...
-Who?
-You know.
-Ondrej blabbered again?
-No, mom told me.
-She knew about them?
-About all of them.
Even about your photographic hobby.
Oh my god.
And you see. She forgave you that time,
too, she wouldn't mind now.
I wouldn't either.
Alice, you know,
I don't even want to anymore...
...when I have nobody to come back to.
(music theme)
(doorbell rings)
I thought you wouldn't show up.
I thought so too.
-What do you have there?
-I'm supposed to be playing tennis.
-With this? -I found it in the basement.
I used to play as a boy.
How did you do?
After two years I became a
pretty good ballboy.
Well then we'll make sure you get better.
(music theme)
Alice, I'm so tired today.
I played five sets...
Well then just relax and leave it to me.
The sample was completely fine.
Your husband is as fertile as a 20-year old.
-What is the problem then, doctor?
-Give it time.
(playful music theme)
-We can't even fit in here.
-And you call yourself a dancer?
(Ondrej): Fuck.
Cut it out, or we
crash again.
Wait. Ouch!
-You bit me! -Just a little bit.
-A little bit? It's visible, what do I say at home?
-It was the brakes. -I'm glad nothing
serious happened to you. Let me see.
No, the doctor said it should stay like
this for a few days.
It'll be okay. Unlike this.
We're going to have to get a new one.
I don't think it's that bad.
We can just...glue this together.
-And the brakes of course.
-I don't trust this car anymore.
We need something safer
and bigger.
Come on, for your shopping or what?
You know we can't afford that.
We're barely holding up.
-Exactly. It's time to do something.
-Like what?
('Upside Down''
by Charlie Straight)
(Ondrej): There you go.
-You don't have protection?
-No. I don't think so.
Oh don't worry, this is
the safest car in its class.
(Ondrej is whistling)
(dishes falling, passionate sounds)
-What got to you? So suddenly?
-It just happened.
-You know, when you're running around like this.
-Oh come on...
Where did all this stamina come from?
It's the tennis lessons, isn't it?
Two vegetable lasagna for table two.
And those ladies on table 4 would like
the specialty you were just making here.
Of course, let's cook.
Again?
-He plays tennis? -Hmm.
-Ondrej? -Yes.
It's been a while.
Three times a week.
And it shows on him. He is different.
He's got that...
-Like last time, he just grabbed me...
-And what?
He's just full of enthusiasm.
So you're happy?
Hmm. Like I haven't been in a while.
Man, stop that right now.
-What?
-The affair.
-What affair?
-You won't fool me. Don't even try.
Look, I don't care who
she is, or how long has it been going on.
Just get rid of her while it's still time.
-But you always told me that for the
well-being... -It did its job.
She's happy now.
You just don't realize how thin,
is the ice you're walking on.
My friend, cheating on your wife,
is like being in a mine field.
One wrong step and you fly! Fly!
Now she's happy,
because she finally has someone
special on her side
but especially because she thinks that
you finally grew up.
But she will find out that
someone else helped you with that.
She's not going to spare you anything.
You can bet on that.
Buddy, she will capture that
little bird of yours
stuff it into the meat grinder,
make it into burgers
and force you to serve them with
your own hands in your restaurant.
-Don't worry, I've got it under control.
-(cell phone rings) -I see.
-Pepa. -Yea. Thanks.
-Tell him I say hi. -I will.
-That's his friend,
they play tennis together. -Aha.
-I should send him a thank-you card for
New Years. -That would please him.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas to you too.
-Dad, when is Santa coming?
-In a little bit, Pavlik.
Hang in there.
-(arlota speaking): Your Santa is here.
I brought you something. -What?
-Where are you?
-Guess.
-Do you need help?
-No, I can manage. -Okay.
-I'll do it.
-Yeah! Good.
Are you coming for that gift?
I'm going to take out the trash.
(lively music theme)
But hurry, Pavlik is getting impatient.
I'll be right back.
Are you crazy?!
-Weren't you supposed to be on a ski trip?
-I missed you.
It's Christmas, I wanted to see
you and thank you for the gift.
Do you like it?
Beautiful.
But you underestimated me.
It could've been one
size bigger.
Thank you though.
And this is for you.
The old one could be suspicious.
Thank you.
(clock dings)
(Christmas music theme)
Just so you keep your form.
I could've gotten one size smaller, right?
That's not a problem.
I'll fill it up when I get pregnant.
(music theme; grotesque)
Hello.
May I speak with you?
Louis, could you leave us
alone for a minute?
-Alice, don't get mad.
-Why should I? I understand you.
-You understand me?
-Yes.
It's been clear to me,
that you desire another person.
I would just prefer if you told
me about it right away.
-I know, Alice, I...
-A newspaper ad would work.
-An ad? -Yes. Actually, I should've
thought of that on my own.
The business started going really well,
we apparently need another waitress.
This girl is perfect.
Wait. Do you want to hire her?
Of course. Louis can't keep
serving the whole place by himself.
I don't know, I think he got better.
I'd still try it with him.
-You'll see, she will attact guys to come here.
-I don't know what they would see in her.
She might not work for you, but trust me,
they will come breaking in.
Look at those boobs!
And that ass!
I would go for that too.
Come here, let me introduce you. Come!
arlota?
This is arlota.
And this is Ondrej.
-My husband and a chef.
-arlota, nice to meet you. -Ondrej.
-So you'd like to work here?
-I can't get by just with dancing.
Ah, a dancer. So you don't have the
necessary experience as a waitress?
I'd been a waitress on a cruise ship
for two years.
And she worked in Florida, Spain and
Greece during high school.
-I had no idea.
-Well, how could you?
-Would you like to see recommendations?
-Yes. -That won't be necessary.
-Let's look at the contract and talk
about that other thing. -What other thing?
What other thing?
(music theme; grotesque)
-This...this is just madness!
-Why?
She will clean a bit, do some laundry,
ironing, and watch over him for me.
-It's worth it for that minimal rent.
-You don't even know anything abouth her.
-Who knows who she is? -What is
your problem with her? I like her.
Your dad will come home from a night
shift and his place might be cleared out.
-Come on.
-It happens.
And this is also a "great" idea.
He is a widower. Mourning.
-And you plant a young girl there for him.
-It'll get his mind off things.
-Well there you go. You know him.
-So what? Even if.
He's almost 3 times older than
her. He might even get a heart attack.
Apparently, arlota has experience
with CPR.
-But still, dad is better than that other guy.
-The other guy? -Some lover.
-She mentioned someone to you?
-Yeah, just by the way. You know.
But how can she build a relationship
only on him being good in bed?
Poor girl.
Good in bed, she said?
-We are coming to help you.
-It's not necessary, thank you. That was all.
Aha. Well then we can go
get something to eat.
Pavlik is away at his aunts' so we
have to use the opportunity.
-Eat? After Christmas? I'll burst.
-Okay then, how about some exercise.
-How about tennis?
-That's a great idea.
We can play in mixed doubles.
Finally I get to see you play.
(music theme)
What have you and Pepa been doing on
the courts all this time? Look for balls?
I'm more of a clay player.
The new racket does it too. I'm not
used to it. We're not coordinated.
-So we switch partners?
-No way. I'm satisfied.
See? I told you they will get along.
It's as if they knew each other before.
I don't remember when was the
last time I saw him having fun like this.
Look at him, flaunting.
I feel like I know him again.
Me too.
(music theme)
Rudolf!
Don't forget the coffee.
Strong, no sugar. Just the way you like it.
If you're going to spoil me like this,
I'll stop driving and stay here with you instead.
-Good night.
-Night.
(door slams;music theme)
-(neighbor): Good evening.
-Good evening.
-What are you doing? -What?
-Well, this! Work, tennis, moving in here.
-Your wife offered this.
-But you accepted it happily.
I want to be with you.
I don't want this anymore.
First thing I hear after making
love is:
-''Have you seen my other sock?''
-You knew what you were getting yourself into.
It worked for you. You said, that as a married
man I won't be around bothering you all the time.
Yes, but I was not in love yet.
Are you mad? Alice will be home any minute.
Do you want her to see us together?
You aren't turned on by that idea?
.
-(cell phone rings)
-Jesus Christ, that's probably Alice.
If I don't pick up, it'll be suspicious.
-Pick up then.
-What? Now?
Yes.
-Hey.
-Hi. How's our little boy?
Good, he's good.
They are...almost spoiling him.
I want to spoil you too.
Come home sooner, at night. I miss you.
I don't think I could.
Roads are frozen. It's slippery...terribly.
Well then at least tell me something nice.
Your voice turns me on.
Yours turns me on too.
(Ondrej is sighing)
Thats nice. Go on.
(mystical music)
(arlota whispers to Ondrej)
Rudolf?
Rudolfe!
-What are you doing?
-That's what she deserves.
I found this
by her memorial.
This she hid in the closet, behind
a vacuum so I wouldn't find it.
And look here. Tulips.
Everywhere. Tulips! And I, the idiot,
for my whole life thought she loved roses.
Meanwhile she was cheating on me.
You know who with?
With her masseur.
Look here.
These are her calendars.
Look.
The little tulip mark means
they had a date on that day.
See it? So many tulips.
God...
I don't know why you make such a big deal
out of this, you cheated on her many times...
-Come on, that's different.
I'm a man. -Yea.
Dammit, stop massaging me!
Do you know how long had she been getting
those massages? 15 years, my friend!
And I felt bad for her. I will find
that bastard!
Rudolf, come on!
A masseur can be a huge guy.
You're right.
(music theme; grotesque)
-Hey!
-Hi.
Did you know her?
Yes.
I'm sorry to ask you like this.
I live across from here and I saw
you here a few times, so I got curious.
-I thought: Maybe family.
-No, no.
But we were close.
Very.
How long have you known her?
-For years. But you can't be interested in that.
-I am. Very.
When she came to me for the first time, her
body was a one big cramp. Blocked all over.
-And you helped her with that, didn't you.
-I tried, but it wasn't easy.
It required time, you know.
It wasn't anything like a
love at first sight.
I understand.
We were slowly moving towards each
other for a long time.
-At first we talked, then we took
walks together... -Why tulips?
I think she needed a change. Her
husband stuffed her with roses all the time.
-I guess he thought she liked roses!
-Yes, that does sound like him.
I believe that he did not really had
an idea about what makes her happy.
Like what?
For example, he had no idea how
much she loved their scent.
Every year, when tulips were blooming
she took me to a garden
and covered herself with them.
And I would smell her.
Never in my life had I smelled
something that beautiful.
I showed her that garden!
That's where Alice was made.
My friend, everywhere we've been,
she took him there too.
Maybe she wanted to remind herself of it.
In the hotel we spent our honeymoon in,
they flooded the whole floor.
-They broke the waterbed.
-where are your keys?
-My friend, I'll drive you anywhere.
-No, no, no, no, no.
She took him on that ride,
where we first met!
They didn't go on it, because
he was worried he'll get sick.
Pussy.
You know what he told me, when I asked him why
does he think she was with him?
She knew I wanted, I desired, to look at
her so much.
-Seriously?
-Yes. That's how he said it.
She needed someone who wouldn't take
their eyes off her.
(music theme)
What is it?
Nothing. I'm looking at you.
Why now?
I should've done it a long time ago.
(radio playing: news about
cold weather)
-Did you also forget the laundry out here?
-Yea.
Nice corset.
Haven't seen you wear it.
-I don't wear it often. It's small on me.
-Aha.
(music theme)
Cut it out! How many times should I
tell you that it's over? Understand that!
-But I only stayed here because of you.
-Nobody's keeping you here. Stop it!
(Ondrej mumbling)
(music theme)
Alright, 8 o clock. Thanks.
-(dispatcher): Vehrdova street to Café Max.
-(Rudolf]: Vehrdova, what street number?
-Eight.
-That's from us. What name?
Doesn't matter, Rudolf, I passed
the order.
-That's too bad, I'd take that.
-Well in that case, you can take 2 tourists there.
On my way. Thanks, Lucka.
-(tourists speaking English): Thank you very much.
-Have a nice time. -Thank you.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
It looks nice here.
You surprised me.
arlota, I need to tell you something.
I know you will probably hate me,
but we need to end this.
I realized I love my wife and I
don't want to lose her.
So you took me here only because you didn't
want me to create a scene, right?
well, that's what I was hoping for.
Alright.
As you wish.
-Excuse me, is everything alright?
-Yes, of course.
(waiter): What can I get you?
-What is the best thing you offer here?
-That depends on what you like.
Depending on price?
Do you take credit cards?
I'll bring you a menu.
.
Good evening.
Move it, gentlemen, the
redhead on table 20
ordered half of the menu with
her Chateau Margot.
-You can never eat all that.
-Doesn't matter, I can taste it.
-(Ondrej): No.
-Alica!
-Hey.
-Hey, arlota.
-What are you doing here alone?
-He'll be along.
Have a seat.
We can wait for him together.
Okay.
-I'll be glad to finally meet him.
-Hmmm.
-How long have you been together?
-A few months -Aha.
-So how did you meet?
-Playing pool. -Pool?
-He did some magic with me there.
-Really?
-I was almost asking myself,
how many times he's done that before. -Hmmm.
-He must be different from
mine. -You think so?
Good evening.
Can I get you anyting to drink?
Only water for me.
No Chateau Margot then?
-I can't drink.
-Are you sick?
-No. Pregnant.
Congratulations!
-What can I get for you madam?
-Also water. A lot of it.
-Should I bring it here or under the table?
-Why under the table?
-What happened? You didn't like it here?
-The worst I've been through.
-Congratulations! Perfect secrecy.
-You're here too?
What did I tell you?
End that affair right away.
What do you think I was trying to do here?
-It's too late though.
-Why late?
Sickness.
That's not from food.
She's pregnant.
Pregnant?
Tnen you are not just in trouble.
You are fucked.
-Thanks for that. What do I do now?
-You're asking me? -You have experience, don't you?
Not of this kind!
I told you: Don't get stuck in it.
-I feel like a complete idiot.
-And so you are.
At least you found that out
before I did.
You can't save it with both.
You will be lucky if you get one.
If you know which one, of course.
-Better?
-Mhm.
Sir, the cake is ready.
Whenever you are ready, give us a signal.
-arlota, are you sure I don't know him?
-Who?
The father of your baby.
Alright then.
If you want to know...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday dear arlota
Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday my love.
-I'm sorry to keep you waiting like this.
I wanted to surprise you. -Dad?
-Alice, what are you doing here?
-And you?
You see, don't you? I wanted something special
for arlota's birthday
-Ondrej said so many good things about this place.
-Would you like another chair?
-Sure.
-Jiøí.
-Is anyone else coming?
-I'm not expecting anyone. Are you?
Let's cut the cake then!
Alice, I'm sorry you found out
this way.
I was so embarrassed. I didn't know,
how to tell you this so you'd accept it.
Like...you mean...you two together?
Since when?
Do you remember
when you found those panties?
Those were yours?
So all these games of pool...?
I was worried that you are mourning
too much... and you were so brave.
arlota did not have it easy
with me back then.
-But when you brought her to me,
I took it as a sign. -What sign?
That I should stop mourning.
I thought you'd not be against it.
But a little flirt is different than
actually getting together...
-...and taking care of a child.
-arlota is not a child!
-But she's going to have one!
-What? -Hmm.
-She's pregnant.
-Really?
That's unbelievable!
arlota, are you as happy as I am?
-Champagne!
-She can't drink.
Then for me. For everybody!
My friends, I'd like to brag. I'm 63 years
old, having a baby with this beautiful creature.
-(guests clapping)
-Isn't it beautiful, my friends?
Why are you ladies looking so sour?
I'm not sure whether you realize what
you're getting yourself into. In your age.
Oh please, what age?
Alice, would you prefer if she had it with
some married idiot?
What would be left for her?
Destroying a family?
Do you know how many people
would be left unhappy?
She would end up alone anyway.
With a baby.
Isn't this a better option?
Besides, I am always
the better option.
-We  can grow old together.
-Didn't you notice you're a bit ahead in this?
-How long, do you think, it'll take before she
finds someone else? -Don't underestimate your father!
arlotka...
...are you going to leave me?
If you don't leave me first.
Why would I leave you?
I'm happy that you have me.
At least I have something to look forward to.
(music theme)
What are we celebrating?
That you are still with me. 2431 days,
that counts for a celebration, doesn't it?
-Oh, I thought you knew about it.
-About what?
No?!
Hmm. Seven weeks.
I never doubted
your fertility.
-Did you cook this?
-No, I just wanted you to taste it.
If you liked it, we could
cook it at our restaurant.
-I ordered it for you.
-For 8 o clock? -Yes.
-Aha.
-What? -Oh, nothing...
Imagine this: I thought you were
cheating on me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't know what
got into me. Sorry...
You could never do
something like that.
Yes, I wouldn't.
But dad! Wait till I tell you what he did.
You're not going to believe that.
.
Hey, Rudolf, I have to
thank you again.
For what?
Taking it all upon yourself.
Why are you so sure that
it wasn't true?
-Can I really keep it?
-Of course, it's yours.
-What should I take pictures of?
-Whatever you want.
I'm not going to tell you what to do,
but did you notice that redhead?
Yes, I did.
-But Grandpa, you can't go in there.
-I know.
But if we never did anything
that's not allowed
we wouldn't have any fun in life.
