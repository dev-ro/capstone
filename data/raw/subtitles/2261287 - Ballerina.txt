Stop!

- Ha!
Where is Felicie?
Uh, sir, I don't know.
What are you looking at,
you idiot?
Whoa!
Go get Felicie!
You know, I'm having
a little bit of trouble
knowing which direction...
- NOW!
- Ugh!
Ouch! Ah!
Victor!
- Can you help me?
- Ha!
Stop! Stop doing
your grumpy face!
I'm not, I'm just a little bit hurt
that you were...
..I don't know,
escaping without me!
Escaping? Me?
No, I was just looking
at the spectacular view!
Because, you know,
you wouldn't last
more than five minutes
out there without me.
Ha! Ha!
Don't start!
You know how this ends.
We arrived at the same time,
and we'll escape
at the same time.
I promise!
OK!
Hey, Victor! Hiyah!
Oh, no! Here we go!

- OK!
Felicie, I know you have
this dream of being a dancer.
- We all know it!
- But I...
Tut-tut-tut!
All the world has a dream.
But get this into your head -
dreams are not reality.
Dreams are buried
because life is
hard, brutal and without pity.
- But...
- Tut-tut-tut!
Agreed?
Agreed.
A dance school in Paris,
little lady,
the Opera de Paris,
full of dancers and dance!
Where did you find this?
I have my sources.
OK? Enough!
- Can I see it again?
- No.
Please!
No, but if you escape with me tonight,
you have my word.
I will take you
to this dance school,
and you will become
the greatest dancer,
and I will become
the greatest inventor ever!
- Do you have a plan?
- A brilliant plan!
A plan worthy of my total,
utter, unquestionable genius.
- Let me see.
- After we...
- Now! Now!
- escape. No!
- I said after.
- Now!
- After!
- Now!
- After!
- Ow!
A dance school in Paris.
Hmm.
Shhh! It's me!
Come on!
Oh, my!
Is a chicken part of
your brilliant plan?
- Affirmative!
- Great!
Aaah!

For the last
three months,
I have been studying chickens.
- I know how they eat.
- Open this door!
I know how they walk.
I know how they lay an egg.
There is nothing about a chicken
that I do not know!
Ta-da!
I call them chicken wings!
Chickens don't fly!
But they have wings.
They must fly.
You fly, don't you?
Fly!

- Yah!
- Grab on! Grab on!
- Oh! Let me go!
- Let him go!
Let me go, stinky! Oh!
That went well, no?
You're unbelievable.
I know.
Victor, we actually did it!
Yes, we actually did!
Oh.
I can fix this.
But I should say
that seeing as this
is the one thing
that was in your crib when you
were left outside the orphanage,
you should take
a teeny-tiny, eensy-weensy
little bit more care of it.
Fixed! Don't thank me!
And tomorrow, Chérie, Paris...
..will be ours.
Good morning, sunshine!
Eww! When's the last time
you brushed your teeth?
Start with this one.

Ugh!
I can't see where we are.
Relax! We're in Paris! Aaah!
Quiet! We're
going to get caught!
Not another noise out of you.
That wasn't me!
Wow!
- It's incredible!
- Paris is amazing.
So, where's the dance school?
Relax, Felicie!
Enjoy Paris. Breathe it in.
Hi there!
Love your moustache, monsieur!
Ah, yes, Paris!
City of romance.
City of dreams.
City of fame and fortune!
City of lamp posts.
City of pigeons.
Did I say romance?
Yes, you did.
Now, where's the dance school?
Uh, I don't know.
Don't worry. We're a team.
- We'll find it together.
- Ugh!
Do you think it was stupid
to come to Paris?
Don't say that! We should
never give up on our dreams.
We're kids! We're all alone.
Was I really crazy to think
I could be a dancer?
What do you think?
Victor?
I said...
Victor?
- I'm OK!
- Come back!
I can't swim!
Meet me on this bridge
at this time tomorrow.
No matter how dangerous it is,
I will return!
Victor! Come back!
Don't leave!
Please.

I wasn't stealing!
I was looking at the dancer!
Liar! Empty your pockets!
- Get off me!
- Oh, yeah?
Leave her alone.
She came here to steal!
I didn't! I really didn't!
Think this through.
If you hurt her,
then you will have to explain
how she got here
in the first place,
and aren't you supposed to be
taking care of the building?
Do you really want
to take the fall for this?
Clear off.
- Wait!

I-I can't sp...
I can't speak!

thank you for saving me!
You've said it.

Excuse me, but who was
that dancer on stage?
Rosita Mauri,
top dancer at the Opera.
Wow!

I'm a cleaner,

Go away.

- Are you the caretaker?
- Yes.
And you can stay with me
until you get on your feet,
on one condition -
no more questions.
How long can I stay?
Ugh. That was a question.
By the way, who was that witch?
Regine Le Haut.
She owns this building.
And she eats ginger orphans
with ponytails.
Now, clean!

have you worked here?
Do you have a nickname?
Wanna know mine?
Will I have my own bed?
What's your favourite soup?
Do you snore?
Are you a morning person?
What's your favourite fruit?
What do you have for breakfast?
I love baguette and jam.
I escaped from the orphanage
to become a pupil at the Opera.
Did you?
You work there,
so you must know people.
- Could you help me?
- Don't hold your breath.
What that étoile did yesterday,
oh, it was so magical.
I love dancing.
Do you love dancing?
Is that because
you've got a limp?
- Get up.
- Yes, ma'am.

You can tell that because...
- Who is that?

who gets their dream first.
- I am going to be an inventor!
- Really?
You're just jealous that,
in 24 hours,
I've got a job with the man
who is building that!
Did you bump your head
when you fell in the boat?
Nope!
Yesterday, after
you got separated,
I just took a quiet walk
around the streets of Paris.
It was all good, totally good.
I was really not scared at all.
I met some charming locals
who helped me find my way.
And you will never believe this,
but then I stumbled on
a Breton bar
and I got a big, warm
and friendly welcome.
They welcomed me like
a brother, a son, a nephew!
And then I met this super guy
called Mathurin.
We talked, we laughed,
we danced together,
and then my new best buddy and I
decided to head home
to his place.
And you are never, ever
going to believe this
but he works in the atelier
of Gustave Eiffel,
the nicest, best
and most magnetic inventor
in the whole world!

the most famous engineer's
right-hand man.

And soon I'm going to be

- Liar!
- OK!
It's Camille Le Haut,

- Liar!
- She wanted to apologise.
- Liar!
- Let me finish.
- Liar, liar...
- So, she gave me the letter
- Liar, liar, liar...
- that allowed her into the Opera.

your nose shivers.
You're exhausting!
I stole her identity.

No, she's right. He hates you.
If he could, he'd smash

Do you have another option?
5am?
Time to train!
Jump and ring the bell!
- Why?
- Just do it.
You don't want me to dance?
No talking.
Jump and ring the bell!
Again.
You said we were going to train.
- This is it! Again!
- Hmm!
Ha!
Felicie, you lack
precision and finesse.
You have little
or no sense of rhythm.
You're without balance,
grace and charm.
Come on! You can't tell all that
from one jump, can you?
You can.
On the good side, you have

is a real Russian prince
with a castle and peacocks
and cheekbones!
And he took me
on the roof of the Opera,
and he was looking at me
like this.
Then like this.
And then once like this.
Wait! Uh, a boy?
What type of boy?
Peacocks?
What type of cheekbones?
- And Rudolph?
- He's a friend.
He says I'm gonna be

But he's deep as well.

- He's the cleaner.

all need sharpening,

and I think they're great.
But it's a start!

And pose and smile!

"Why do you dance?"
I've answered it!
It's my dream!
Oh! Oh!
Ow! Ow!
Oh!
By the way, that crazy jumpy thing
is called le grand jeté,
and you're not ready.
Are you doing dance
or kung-fu?
You are SO funny.
This is Victor. We escaped
from the orphanage together.
Hello!
I am loving your apron.
It seems that
you are going out tonight.
Yep!
Bring her back late
and you will be six inches smaller.
Of course, of course, of course!
It's a quiet, sober,
quiet, sober thing.
- Breton music?
- Whoa!
Whoa! Excuse me!
Whoo!
- I love it here!
- Whoo!
Let's party!
Did you say
you loved me or the bar?
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
Whoa!
Wow!
Whoo!
That's my girlfriend!
You're a lucky guy!
Oh, wow!
Oh! Oh!
I hope that tomorrow you act
with a little more dignity.
Anyway, tonight was...
a good performance.
Thank you, sir.
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!
I have no idea why
you're happy, but it is great!
Whoo!
Well, I'd better go in.
I've got my audition tomorrow.
Of course! Sleep well.
And I... I...
- What?
- I think you're, uh...
I think you're great.
Thanks.
- What are you doing?
- Uh, oh, nothing!
I'm stretching.
Yeah, gotta...
Ooh, gotta get that one!
OK! Yeah, it's best I leave.
Stupid,
stupid, stupid!
- Hey, Victor!
- Uh-huh?
I had the best time.
Thanks!
Goodnight, Felicie.
Oh, sorry.
Mademoiselle Camille Le Haut.
Wretch!
I want her put in prison!
She stole my life,
my honour and my name!
I want it back!
- Too much.
- OK.
What is your name?
My name is Felicie Lebras.
I come from an orphanage
in Brittany.
I didn't mean to hurt Camille.
I just wanted to be
at the Opera and...
I'm sorry.
Madame...
You traitor!
You knew this!
You stabbed me in the back!
- You are sacked!
- Silence!
Alright, like it or lump it,
here is my deal.
Miss Le Haut,
you may enter the coryphée class
starting tomorrow.
And you will also
be in the auditions
for the part in 'The Nutcracker'.
But I want to be clear,
if you sack Madame Odette,
I will sack Camille.
You!
You made a terrible start
to the classes,
and you have lied
and cheated to be here.
But you have also
shown great promise,
and you've worked hard
and shown your dedication.
You must have a good teacher.
So you may also stay
in the auditions.
If you get the part in 'The Nutcracker'
fair and square,
you may become a coryphée too.
If you fail to get the part,
then you must leave the Opera.
- Is that clear?
- Yes.
Is that also
clear to you, madame?
Clear.
Then, Felicie Lebras
from Brittany,
your future at the Opera
is in your hands.
Hmm!
What if she's good, Mother?
Get that part, do you hear me?
I want vengeance.
I will have it.
She even makes sweeping
look graceful.
She was a good dancer,
wasn't she?
Not just a good dancer.
The best of her generation.
And then there was
a fire onstage.
Oh!
What's this for?
For everything!
We don't have time
for this.
We're talking about
your future now.
You have only one opponent -
Camille.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
I have seen her.
I know her.
Her technique is perfect,
and she is stronger
than she looks.
She is precise,
she is sharp,
and losing is not a word
in her vocabulary.
Up, down! Up, down!
Up, down! Again!
- Up, down!
- I'm tired.
'Tired' is for losers!
Again! I am going
to get that part!
If you try to take her down
on her turf, you will fail.
Your diet suffers
from eating very little food.
Your muscles
are like marshmallows.
In short, on paper,
you're going to get humiliated.
Great pep talk!
So, how do I get that part?
You get the part
because you have something
she can only dream of -
passion!
(UPLIFTING MUSIC)
Build on this.
Feel your anger and your pain
and your sorrow and your joy,
and put it all into your dance.
Live the music, feel it.
Every note, every sound,
every harmony
needs to have
your body vibrating
from the end of your hair
to the tips of your toes.
And then, and only then,
will you take her down.
Alright! The person
leaving us today is...
(TENSE PIANO MUSIC PLAYS)
Ahem!
- (PIANO STRINGS RESONATE)
- Hmm!
This is the end of the road,
Miss Nora.
What road?
Oh, I'm finished.
I like you. Beat her.
Camille and Felicie,
tomorrow morning at 8:00am,
we will know which one of you
will have the honour
of dancing Clara
in 'The Nutcracker' with Rosita.
I can only advise you
to give everything, ladies.
You've made lots of progress,
dirty, little rat,
but tomorrow I am going
to be the chosen one.
We'll see.
You can work
as hard as you like,
you can train 24 hours a day,
but you will always be nothing!
- I am somebody.
- Who exactly?
Answer me! Who are you?
You're nothing!
Nothing!
She's wrong, you know.
- You're not alone.
- What?
You have me.
And I know exactly
what we are going to do.
Tonight, to prove
our connection,
we will embark on
a little romantic party.
I offer you the Eiffel Tower.
I offer you fireworks.
- Tonight, 7:00pm.
- I should train.
You don't need to train.
You don't need to know
who you are.
You are unique.
Say that again?
Tonight.
Felicie, it gives me
great pleasure
to present to you...
No!
Victor! I'm in
the final audition!
Wow! Congratulations!
I have great news too.
My boss finally spoke to me!
He said, "Get off my foot,
you biological mutation!"
That's good, right?
Ugh! You have no class.
What, me? No class?
- Rudi has class.
- Rudi again?
What, is he your boyfriend now?
No! He and I,
we're connected.
OK, OK. You win!
I'll give you class
and connectivity-ness.
Dinner! You and me.
Some knives and forks, napkins.
Uh, 7:00pm, north leg
of the Eiffel Tower.
Is that a yes?
Yeah.
That's a yes.
Sit! I've got something
for you.
They were mine.
Now they're yours.
Wow! Thanks.
OK, enough talking.
Eat, and then we practise
for tomorrow.
What?
Well, I'm going out with Rudi.
He says I'm ready.
He says I'm unique.
Why do you dance?
Stop asking me that question!
When I was a dancer,
the night before an audition,
I trained and then I rested.
- Rudi's waiting for me.
- Stay!
No! You're not my mom!
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
OK. Go, then.
(UPLIFTING MUSIC)
Look at the bird.
Um...
No! Look at me.
Look at the bird.
No! Hmm? Look at me.
This is a poem I composed
in your honour.
Ah, of course, a poem.
"Look at the bird!
"He flies in the sky.
"No-one can trap him."
Do you like?
That's, uh...
..well, original.
I know. Thank you.
Come on, Minoushka!
Let us go to the very top!
To the stars!
OK, Matty, we practise.
Music, please! Classical!
OK, but that's not
my musical comfort zone.
Oh, stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
We'll go Breton,
but soft and romantic.
This will blow her away.
She arrives, she giggles.
I am looking dark
and mysterious.
I give her the music box.
She's... "Oh! Oh!"
Overwhelmed!
Uh, I don't know much
about girls.
Frankly, they are
a mystery to me.
But I do know that
this one's not coming.
Young, innocent fool!
Of course she will come!
I can already smell
her perfume.
Oh, no!
Oh, beggars! Ugh!
Paris is infested
with beggars! Yuck!
- But...
- Don't be afraid.
- But...
- Quiet! Follow me.
Have no fear, I have developed
a fighting technique
based on Cossack dancing.
Don't be ridiculous!
OK, stop right there!
He's my friend!
Oh, is this some kind of joke?
No! This is Victor.
We grew up together.
Oh, my! This is funny.
Friends, huh?
If we're friends,
why are you looking so ashamed?
- I'm not looking ashamed.
- Oh, yes, you are!
I feel sorry for you, Felicie.
- Oh! You're jealous.
- No!
Ever since you started
at the Opera,
who are you trying to be?
Mixing with this
big, hairy asparagus?
- You're so sad.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I could knock you out
with one flick of my tiny finger,
but that would make my finger
dirty and smelly.
So, I'm dirty, but at least
I don't spend my day in tights!
I can't believe this!
She is MY muse.
Yeah, well, she is my
whatever-you-just-said, too,
with knobs on, asparagus!
Stop!
You're both idiots!
OK.
Well, goodbye, then.
Well, goodbye.
That is so low!
Oh, no! The audition!
('WALTZ OF THE FLOWERS'

Hmm...
- I'm sure this...
- Watch it!
..production of 'Nutcracker'
is going to...
Excuse me!
Hmm...
Hey!
Bravo! Bravo!
Thank you, mademoiselle.
The orphan is late.
It's over.
Ahem!
Well, as Felicie did not deign
to show up for the audition,
it is Camille who will dance
with Rosita.
Wait! Wait! I'm here!
Please, please let me dance.
It's over!
Don't you understand?
Sit down!
- I-I apologise.
- Did you sleep?
Not much.
Did you train yesterday?
- No.
- Why?
Alright, music!
Hmm!
- Start again.
- She fell! She's eliminated!
Start again!
You remember our deal?
Camille,
you will have the honour
of dancing Clara
in 'The Nutcracker'.
Did you think it would end here,
little rat?
No! Let me go! No!
Oh, no!
Please! Please!
Odette! No!
Odette!
Felicie!
You will never see her again.
And, of course, you're sacked.
Stop!
Where is Felicie?
Ahem!
I'm here.
Oh! Well, uh, good.
- She's lost her spirit.
- Tut-tut-tut!
Pull yourself together,
you big fool!
I know. I miss him too.

Nope! I don't know that.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Goodbye, then.
'Bye, Victor.
That wasn't him.
He is not here.
Victor has worked
a miracle! Who'd have thought?
He just has the look
of a total nitwit.
He doesn't wanna
speak to me ever again.
- He will.
- No, no, no!
- Here we go!
- Stop! As cold as lard!
Miss Le Haut,
you perform tonight
and so far, we have no emotion!
But I'm doing exactly
the steps you told me.
It's not enough to do the steps.
Find some anger or some pain
or some love,
but find something!
She lacks this.
Tonight will make that clear.
OK, I'm going to do
the stairs in the lobby.
- You can finish here.
- OK.
Leave it. Give it back.
Silly me!
I didn't throw it hard enough
the first time.
Don't make the same mistake.
Why are you leaving?
Scared of being humiliated?
Looks like you need
more training.
You are nowhere near ready.
I'm going to show you
what a real dancer looks like.
- Are you sure about that?
- Quiet!
Tonight these seats
will be full.
Paris will be looking at me,
adoring me!
- Or not.
- I already told you!
You are nothing.
You will always be nothing!

Impressive, ladies.
But let me ask you both
an important question.
Why do you dance?
I dance because...
I dance because... because...
..my mother makes me.
Because it's always been
a part of my life.
It was there with my mom
when I was a baby,
and it's here now,
thanks to Odette.
It allows me to live,
to be myself.
She should dance.
That was very honest,
Miss Le Haut, and brave.
You have a future at the Opera,
if you wish it.
Felicie, tonight,
YOU dance 'The Nutcracker'.
Great job.
Well done, my sweetness!
OK. Bravo, bravo.
- Oh, bravo!
- Yes! Yes!
Voilà!
- I call them Pigeon Wings!
- Wow! Great!
But I'm not sure
I want to test them.
Live dangerously, Matty!
I promise you they will
almost certainly work.
Oh!
This is nice!
Matty, can you give us
some privacy?
- When?
- Matty, privacy!
Oh, now. OK!
I'm dancing tonight
at the Opera.
- I want you to be there.
- Really?
Really.
I like you, Felicie.
You make me laugh and cry
at the same time.
You're a weirdo!
Tut-tut-tut!
You cannot help him.
First you deceive my daughter.
- Then you take her identity!
- Mom, stop!
Now you try and take
our honour and our future?
Mother!
Do you think you can
turn my daughter against me
and get away with it?
Ah! No-one cheats me!
Mother! You scared her! Stop!
The last time she was this late,
it did not end well.
Aaah!
Hey, it's Matty
and his twin sister!
What happened?
There's a big, scary lady
chasing your girl up the statue,
trying to kill her.
- What?
- And, also, I wet myself.
Come on! Quickly! Save her!
Matty, the Pigeon Wings!
(FRANTIC MUSIC)
This is the only crown
you will touch today,
victim of a terrible accident
on the night of your debut.
You will have something
to share with Odette.
Both of you used to be dancers.
Felicie!
- Let go!
- Oh!
Uh-oh! OK!
Uh-oh.
Felicie!
- Ha, ha, ha!
- No!
Whoo!
Whoa!
- No!
- Whoo!
Felicie, don't worry.
We'll be on time!
Higher! YES!
We will be on time!
In version three,
it might be a good idea
to work on some brakes.
Can't you just say
that I've invented something
and it worked?
- I can.
- Then say it!
Victor François Xavier
the First,
you're a great inventor.
Thank you.
You're ready.
Then dance from right here.
You won the bet.
You made your dream come true.
