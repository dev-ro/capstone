February 1982
The Dark House
My name is Edward Srodon.
I was born in Rzeszów,
in 1938,
on June 2nd.
I am 44.
For 9 years I was working at State Farm
in Mosty, Stettin voivodship.
Good specialization.
Graduate of a vocational high-school.
I can say that I was happy.
Grazyna, my wife,
I met at my friend's wedding.
I proposed after 2 months.
Good marriage,
but no children.
Wife's strong retroflexion...
so the doctor said.
Cause with the girls you never,
you never know,
if it's going great,
or you should pack to go...
You know what? Rakoski was
poaching fish with electricity,
and water got into his rubber boots.
And he ended up in intensive care...
Grazyna?
Grazyna.
Do you hear me?
Grazyna!
Mundek!
Come here, quick!
She fell down.
Mother of God!
What happened?
Save her!
Fuck, do something!
But what?
Mrs. Grazyna!
Do something!
Jesus. She's not breathing.
Reanimate her, damn it!
Save her!
Grazyna!
She's not breathing...
Move it! Grazyna.
Grazyna, wake up!
Wake up!
Fuck!
Scram!
Grazyna!!! Fuck!
Fuck.
Cerebral hemorrhage...
It was hard to pull oneself together.
Emptiness.
My job in Mosty went down the drain.
To buy vodka I was selling things.
Our common things.
Time was passing by.
I hit the bottom.
Mr. Srodon, wait.
3 for you today.
I wanted to get away, or to flee,
shall I say.
I sent out offers.
Get in the line!
I chose the Krosno voivodship.
State farm in Lutowiska.
Nothing special, the location mattered.
You couldn't get further away.
I sold everything
and got the insurance money
for my dead wife.
Not much, but I was to earn the rest.
I am still young, I thought.
I'll find myself a woman,
God willing sire a son.
Or a daughter.
Extend my bloodline.
October 1978
Wozniak fucked up, thought it was past
the road chapel, hence the delay.
Why are you dragging him
in this condition?
I was ordered to take him.
- And why technical department?
- The phone is off
and neighbors know she works in militia,
so they won't help.
And here Banas can drive her
to hospital if needed.
Good morning Lieutenant!
I was walking over there.
Ok., ok.,
soon you'll tell us all about it.
Besides Jasiak has the camera, so
she can do the protocol, or something.
Hallo!
Hallo, Miss...
Who are you...?
Who, who? The dog bit me.
The door was open... See for yourself!
Says Blackie chomped him.
That's what he is for.
Probably was just teasing.
Should be cleaned for disinfection,
there is tetanus in the mud.
And once I've smuggled a jar
of chicken shit across the border.
I bought eggs at 50 pfennig a piece.
And then I smeared those German eggs
with Polish shit
and sold them at the double price,
as fresh,
straight from the Polish farm.
Swedish...
Got it from a sailor, whom I helped
to sell dollars on the black market.
Mr. Edek is traveling for 2 days.
He's on the way to the state farm.
Last year when the inspection arrived
they couldn't trace down
20 tones of sugar.
That's how much they were able
to swindle out...
Or tractors.
They are allowed to purchase
Fergusons from the producer.
Directly, I mean...
Tell him about the zootechnician.
There was one,
Stec was the name.
Went to church,
not like the rest of them.
Wrote complaints to the authorities.
And disappeared.
At the farm they said
he went on a drinking spree.
True, he liked the drink.
- But there is big money at stake here!
- And?
Probably soon you'll have in the papers
that he was hit by a car,
or drowned in the San river.
They've already admitted he's gone,
because they are looking
for a replacement.
- Why are you staring like this?
- Because they found one.
It's me. I am a zootechnician.
Fuck, no doubles, no work.
Sir, yesterday I've sung the Soviet
national anthem in "Ratuszowa".
That's a joke?
No. And I pissed on the table.
While singing?
I don't know.
We were all wasted...
Jasiak,
I just saved your ass in Przemysl.
Were you in uniforms?
- No, plain clothes.
- Any witnesses?
This is exactly where
I first saw Bozena Dziabas.
You're experimenting with camera,
and you don't have doubles?
I'll file a memo stating negligence.
This is my official order.
And anyone who refuses
to carry out an order,
being an employee
of the militarized enterprise,
is liable to penalty
of im... prisonment...
Take the prosecutor to the van.
Sorry...
Happens often here...
Have you found it?
Candles, but no fuses.
- Wire can fix it. I'll do it.
- Wire and pliers in the other room.
Give us a light.
Quiet, Blackie!
Lightings make him mad.
Fuck! Fucking Hell!
Are you keeping a bike in the house?
- Were they keeping a bike in a house?
- Yeah. It seemed strange to me.
It's Janek's, my son's.
Can get wet outside.
I keep all the junk in a barn,
so he brought it in.
God damn it!
This one should work.
So, a son in the farm
is what's important, isn't it?
Janek? A bright kid.
All A's and B's at school.
Graduated from the technical
vocational school.
Can fix everything at home.
Depends on when.
He can assemble such a bike
and disassemble.
Good with mechanics.
"On July 14th '78 Madecki Thaddeus,
fire brigade chief,
reported his WSK motorcycle stolen,
registration number
KSL 0450, paint color: red."
He said, that if we don't buy him
a Polonez car,
he'll leave the farm...
- It's hard for me to believe.
- In what?
This...
What you said
about the other zootechnician.
Believe it or not, your choice...
Shut up, you stinker!
This is not America,
for people to disappear like that.
One more?
...high quality derma
the color of your choice.
Brown or black.
A modern car.
Zero to a hundred
in just over ten seconds...
And practical, for the whole family.
Chassis, ideal for our roads...
Chicken soup in an hour.
It's unhealthy to drink without a snack.
Our supplies buyer in Mosty
had one, brand new.
All defects were quickly fixed
on warranty. Spoke highly of it.
That it's fuel efficient.
And what about the car voucher?
Parson has special contacts
at regional state car dealer.
Only the money...
Boy's restless...
Young, so impatient.
They want to have fun,
pick up a chick.
Give her a ride.
Screw her.
He went to party
and is gone for 3 days.
Today he didn't come back too.
And if you try to tell him
he drinks too much, a row...
No use talking.
Let's drink.
Cheers.
I need to the can.
What's going on?
Did you go to the proctologist?
No.
Why?
Doesn't sound good.
- It isn't black.
- I call every dog Blackie...
Hush!
Fox!
Have you seen it?
A Fox got inside.
Killed 3 of my hens already.
Takes advantage of the rain,
scoundrel.
Run to the front!
On my mark,
start beating on the hen house.
And shout as loud as possible.
He'll come out through the hole
on the other side,
and I'll smack the rascal...
Now!
Yell!
Scrams to the woods!
Are you all right?
Did they give you passports?
It's being arranged.
And the clinic?
They're holding a place for us.
But each day of delay
may have consequences.
Halinka is pissed.
It must be nerves
I am getting these shits from...
Mrs. Pokrywka and her son.
They agreed to be doubles...
for 100 cigarettes.
And some tins.
Good work, Banas.
- Got it?
- I pulled up to the store...
Just tell me, if you got
a place in a queue?
No, cause I did better...
See?
Stec, Lieutenant.
The zootechnician's name was Stec.
Clear the vodka.
No talking on the radio.
Stay inside.
Prosecutor fell on his face in the snow,
and is recovering now...
Get in, it's bloody windy.
- A drink?
- No, thank you.
I've heard you used to sport that.
Not anymore.
It seems you don't belong anywhere.
I'm not interested in politics.
Nowadays it's hard to set things apart.
For example, your suspect.
What's his name...?
Srodon. Criminal case.
Criminal...?
You'll get him sentenced,
and we might let him leave the country.
We've got a directive to mix
the offenders with political émigrés.
Thus we'll smear the image
of Solidarity in the West,
and we'll get rid of the element.
And your Srodon
is not exactly so criminal.
In '76 he was setting fire
to Party headquarters in Radom.
This one I can leave you.
I have a private request.
I went through protocols
of interrogation...
Should he be deposing something
about embezzlements, state farms,
sugar plant, wipe it out.
Ignore it.
It has nothing to do with your case,
and someone can get hurt.
Economic offences are the area
of prosecutor Tomala.
No, you'll have to do it yourself,
because apparently vodka
doesn't suit him.
And, of course, keep it confidential.
As I shall this picture.
Why are you so tense?
Relax.
I'll play you some music.
We confiscated it from one lad
at the demonstration in Cracow.
How to become perfect,
mannish, handsome, strong?
How to achieve your goal
without stepping in the wrong?
Ask the militiaman
He'll tell you the truth!
Ask the militiaman.
He'll point you the right direction!
He'll point you the right direction!
Poor quality, isn't it?
Garage studio.
As we are talking music and militia,
let's discuss yesterday's incident
with Sergeant Jasiak.
There was a delegation from Leningrad
in this restaurant.
They've reported.
Phone calls from the Ministry
from the early morning,
the Party Committee buzzing
that militiamen got drunk.
That they were offending
the Soviet Union.
It was just an accident.
This Jasiak is already gone!
The only question is,
whether you'll file a memo
and save your ass,
or you are stupid enough,
to force me to do it
and then you are both finished.
I'll also need a list of those
who drank with him.
I'll collect it
on the way back from Arlamow.
And I know how to be grateful
for the sugar plant.
What would you say
for an early promotion to Capitan,
a Polonez car,
and in the future continuing
your career in Warsaw?
Because Rzeszow seems too small for you.
What did he want?
Radom, '76.
And this took you so long to discuss?
Damn, we'll be fucking with this case
for months.
But why, is he political?
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Banas give me the keys.
Drink what you have to drink,
and when I'm back, no more booze.
- Lisowski! You're in charge.
- Yes sir.
From the top rank down!
Somebody took our picture.
In the hotel, in Jastarnia.
Get inside.
Militia from Sanok arrived.
They started looking
for an arsonist in the village.
They've found some evidence
at the site of the fire.
But no one was caught red-handed.
So they went away
and the next week
2 more barns burned down.
Thus we called up
a citizens watch
and agreed with Madecki,
our fire brigade chief,
to patrol at nights. Because all
the fires started at night only.
The Militia was snooping around again.
They even suspected Janek,
because he had no alibi for one night.
But everything was
cleared up eventually.
And on the following night
another shed is burning.
We ran with Janek
to help put out the fire.
Madecki sees the wind's pushing flames
toward the forest.
He orders to call in reinforcements,
because he can't handle it alone.
Janek went to make a call.
There are 3 phones in the village.
at parson's,
in the state farm
and at Madecki's,
because he's a fire chief.
Stop it!
- Why this stench of petrol?
- Damn, if you squeal a word...
And he draws a knife
from his pocket.
- And it turned out to be what?
- What?
Blacharz was setting sheds on fire.
Madecki was out to quench them, and at
that time Blacharz was screwing his wife.
Yeah, extinguishing a barn
can take the whole night.
Fiery love affair,
that's how they called it in a paper.
- And what happened with this Blacharz?
- He's serving time.
In the nearby jail.
They say, he's got a walleye.
And a huge chunk of forest
went up in smoke,
because Janek smashed the phone.
Such a scheme, Mr. Dziabas,
only to get laid...
Why are we so formal?
I'm older so I should propose.
- Zdzisiek.
- Edek. Edward.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Who ever will talk to me,
gets cigarettes.
About the state farm.
And the zootechnician who disappeared.
Anyone knows who I am taking about?
Militia issue?
That was, when they elected the pope.
Will do?
No... It was earlier. The pope
was in October. On the 16-th.
You've introduced Martial Law,
so you have it.
Booze sold from 1.00 pm and smokes
only for the chosen. Bloody hell.
Jan Stec. Sung so nicely at church.
Yeah, religious, he was.
Only didn't like beer.
Said it muddles him.
Once he shit in the milk can.
- He didn't drink with us.
- Most often with the priest.
With the priest he was up
to something else.
- Quiet, you pervert.
- Laying pipe or blowing it.
Fuck, give us the whole bag! They have
everything without ration coupons!
Solidarity!
...Satan can use to his ends...
because aren't nuclear holocausts...
Because, nuclear holocaust...
holocausts, Jesus... aren't they.
Aren't nuclear
holocausts the proceeds...
And the totalitarian
Stalinist state...
I am not interested in politics.
Just criminal cases.
I'd like to talk about
the zootechnician.
Jan Stec.
...so one must think of something
to substitute in this place...
to quench this seasonal demand.
What other problems are there
with the rainwear?
It seems we have only
an umbrella at our disposal.
I'm impressed, as you must have made
an extensive market analysis,
because you hit the bull's eye
as far as article assortments go.
One has to say that today
in such rainwear
we generally can offer an umbrella.
Of course, you would be thinking about
some interesting coat...
A coat, shoes, rubber boots.
I have to admit that the first issue
that makes me uneasy
is the problem of a coat or a cape.
The first clothing of such a type
used to be a coat or a cape...
Thank you. Delicious. Haven't tasted
something that good in long time.
Nothing special, quickly made.
You have asked a very
bothering question.
The matter is, that for the longer
period of time...
Sorry.
...the industrial offer
of such clothing has diminished.
It was delicious. I am full.
It's a very hospitable home here,
but I should be on my way.
Really, I have to be going.
Are you uncomfortable here, Edek?
No, quiet opposite.
At 4 there is nobody in the farm,
except for the watchman.
Bozena will tell you.
Tell him Bozena.
Besides, do they know
you are coming today?
No. All they know is that
I am coming this week.
See? You can sleep here.
Janek won't come back tonight.
You'll rest like a king.
It's true. Everything's closed down
at the farm.
We'll have a drink, and in the morning,
you'll be there in one hour.
I'm causing a trouble.
You want to spend a family evening.
Cut the crap. Let's drink.
Make us a coffee.
And switch to Bratislava.
All this politics
makes me want to puke.
Dear friends.
The Warsaw automobile factory presents...
I'll make the bed at Janek's.
...an amazing new car.
Look Edek! We were just talking...
Polonez.
In czesky television!
Jan had stolen invoices, reports
and protocols of damage
from the state farm and
a couple of cooperatives.
I know, a wrong deed,
but for noble reasons.
He wanted to stop emblazonments.
In the paper they wrote he was driving
a mini-Fiat and collided with a truck.
But he didn't have driving license.
Dead on the spot.
Here they report he spent the night
with a woman of ill repute,
this is her nickname and initials.
Probably you can trace her down.
She informed how much they drank
and that later...
You know...
But Jan was a homosexual and suffered
greatly because of his shortcoming.
One more thing...
Quiet recently, a Solidarity activist,
the same curve near Nisko.
Maybe a coincidence,
but maybe a method.
I am happy to dispose off
this earthly secret...
Of course I shall renounce
everything in the court.
So, Zdzislaw, you're saying
that this state farm is fishy?
Tomorrow you'll see for yourself,
and know more than we do...
Have to go out for a moment.
Fresh air will do me good.
And I need to put out the snare
for the fox.
While I'm still sober.
Shall I go with you?
No. Drink the coffee.
She'll make us a strong one.
I'll get the fucker.
Excuse me.
What's going on?
She might have a crevice,
but won't let me have a look.
Everything's all right.
Fuck, all right.
She had contractions.
Bloody hell. What did you do
with the car, Lieutenant?
Take her to the hospital.
- There's no need.
- No discussion.
Why are you making all this fuss?
The baby is due in 2 weeks.
He hit you?
The nearest hospital is in Krosno.
If not, then Sanok or Korczyn.
- Where's Lisowski?
- He's no good. I'll go with her.
Lisowski... Lieutenant got boozed up
and started yelling
that he'll do a blood test
when the child is born.
- He hit her? - But just once.
Then we've put him into the van.
Only the keys were inside
and he drove away.
- Where to?
- Fucking vanished, sir. - And Tomala?
The Prosecutor woke up earlier,
downed a shot and is like a newborn.
Now he's conducting the investigation.
Petrycki, you were in the traffic
department until recently?
Yeah.
The curve near Nisko.
Many accidents?
It's a private question.
Once a certain Major hit a truck.
They say,
he was blown away for arm deals.
Petrycki,
- go see the dentist.
- My molar is giving me hell...
- So, how much have you drank? A lot?
- We had a bit.
But precisely?
I am talking grams.
There you are finally.
So...?
We were into third bottle by then.
Me and Dziabas,
we drank more then half a liter each.
And she was just sipping.
300 grams, not more.
Have you been convicted
for drunken brawls?
Give me that.
You read it.
"Mosty, Stettin voivodship, 1973.
Suspect Edward Srodon pushed
a colleague into the pond.
Fined with a warning
in his employee record."
- What are you trying to pin on me?
- Gdynia, 1975, a fight in a bar...
You don't have any sugar
at home for the guest's coffee?
Turning a house into the joint?
Watch it, you whore, or you'll get it!
- I was too good, wasn't I?
- Easy, take it easy.
Wanna leave? Nobody's stopping you!
Nothing here is yours.
You're ready to fly again? You want
to fuck and fool around? So scram!
You are drunk like a skunk again.
Zdzichu, calm down.
- Eddie.
- Calm down.
Yeah, calm down.
At the wedding, her sister
six times shuttled to the barn.
And later he wept, because
he could have charged
300 per bang...
You bitch.
Janek's mother died when he was five.
Bozena,
I took from a joint.
Quiet!
I needed a woman.
And if someone laughed, that she's
younger, I'd smash his mug.
Guys like to lay their eyes on her.
You like that too, Edek.
I'm sure kidneys are going to hurt me
like hell tomorrow.
Maybe, if you'd had the factory made,
but not mine.
Zdzich, do you think
I can't smell a moonshine?
You didn't this one.
In Mosty we were distilling too.
It was smelly, but still
we were making good money.
Only, by stupid mistake,
the militia found out...
They ruled high penalties.
But I was lucky,
totally stoned
I landed for 3 days in Radom.
Holly shit.
Damn.
Wait, wait.
The car radiator.
Copper piping.
Dephlegmator!
What kind of strength are you getting?
After 4 runs - 92 per cent.
I'll be damned, impressive!
And what's the raw stock?
If it's not a secret, of course.
Peas.
I add lemon. Kills the smell
and doesn't alter the taste.
But they can't be Hungarian.
Too weak.
You should be selling.
To whom?
Half of the people here moonshine.
What a kick.
Zdzich! Let's do it together!
We'll put a rectifying column here,
one meter, no meter and a half...
We'll have to dig it into ground.
Are there any Soviet units
in the area?
An ideal place! I know what to do, because
in Mosty it was running smoothly.
Then why did they find out?
One of ours was
selling booze to militia.
They got drunk at the station.
A scandal.
But we'll sell only to the Soviets,
on an industrial scale, I mean...
So what? A deal?
Zdzich.
Agreed?
Deal.
Labor 10 thousand,
this includes radiators.
Ten thousand.
- Where did you get the copper from?
- From a factory in Sanok.
This amount I have here
cost 2,000
- 14 thousand.
- And a grand for transport.
Can't smuggle so much copper
on the bus.
Fuck off my barrel.
Don't fuck with me.
It's too small.
- Fuck yourself.
- Buzz off. We'll need a water pump.
And glass pipes?
Madecki's brother-in-law
works in the glassworks.
In Krosno.
I'll find a way to organize sugar
from the state farm.
Won't be easy. The Party keeps
it's hand on it. For cronies...
Fuck them.
Damn, wait...
Dziabas said,
the priest had good connections,
because he secretly gave first communion
to the sugar plant director's son.
And if we spare him a hundred bucks,
everything can be arranged.
The sugar plant has nothing
to do with the case.
Don't put it into the protocol!
And the suspect, be brief, because
we're not going to sit here all night.
How much money did you need?
200.
Milk cans.
Janek will pull out some
from the dairy.
Twenty for delivery
and twenty for exchange.
- 50.
- 50 to make it even.
If worse comes worse,
ten will do for transporting milk.
50... 15,
totals 59.
First delivery should be free,
to entice them.
Cheers.
Dollars, 6, 8...
Fuck! 100 for starters.
I've thought it would be less too.
Damn,
a serious venture.
Wait. Say,
how many Ruskies are in the base?
3,000 or 5,000 for sure.
- Maybe more, hell knows them.
- Ok, but let's say five.
Carry the five, zero down.
Jeez, 50 grand for a delivery.
That gives 200 in a month.
Holly shit, in 4 weeks
you get your investment back plus
100 grand for 2 of us!
And the next month only half
of the cost, just for the raw stock.
You'll be picking up
your Polonez in January!
And in the future
we could add this jail,
where's this guy
who did Madecki's wife.
They'll always find money
for booze in prison.
- Polonez...
- Polonez you'll have...
Fuck, just one hundred for starters...
- Polonez...
- We'll be fucking rich! Zdzich!
- Edek... Eddie...
- What, Zdzich?
Help me.
- With what?
- Move it.
Edward, under this floor
lays 60 thousand.
I was putting away for Janek,
for the Polonez.
Sixty thousand.
Zdzich, this is fucking everything
I have left in my life.
43 thousand zlotys,
30 PKO dollar coupons,
91 dollars...
and 52 Deutsch marks.
Zdzich.
Eddie.
Eddie, I am telling you,
we'll do it.
Zdzich, in this suitcase...
You've got brains brother,
to figure it all out...
Fucking amazing.
Enough.
You can use some sleep too.
You won't get up in the morning.
Bozenka, darling...
I didn't mean it, I was just talking...
Go.
Bloody hell!
Where is Marysia?
Bugger off!
What moonshine trading?
Don't you know
how it is when you had a drink?
Drunk people say crazy things!
And Mosty?
- What about it?
- Seventy six?
Did they prove anything to me?
Break.
He keeps everything for this stinker.
And sonny is almost 31, drinks,
spends all the money and rules.
He shows up at home
only when he is short of cash.
He'll milk every last cent.
He tried to lay hands on me. When
I chased him away, slammed his face,
he told the old man that I steal
and sleep around.
And isn't it true?
Why do you say that, Edek...?
Why did you get in my bed?
To play fucking cards?
There is one already here,
who when drunk turns into a redneck.
You gave me a shag, but if you want
to babble on like this, then scram.
What's with your face?
Give me this memo on Jasiak.
I don't have it.
Then write it down.
I've already told you,
I'm not interested in politics.
Interesting...
Banas reported
that it bears your fingerprints.
Should Lieutenant be interested,
I can spare a few kilo.
They checked us on 3 roadblocks!
Didn't look for a pig.
One of the interns went AWOL.
But they won't find him.
Because who escapes
from internment camp?
For sure some secret police plant. They're
making a cover story for the prick.
Or this scoundrel Jasiak.
You're defending him,
and he reported on you as a participant
in appropriation of the sized vodka.
Remember Przemysl, Bork's case?
You vouched that the dog knocked down
the crate to the ground.
And your friend, expert Zajdel.
Was so happy when I promised him
a passport for his wife,
that he wrote,
you are drinking on duty.
Admit it, you won't return
when you get passports.
You know any reason for coming back?
That he sew you twice. In 1976...
Anyone else?
All of them.
I didn't have to ask Lisowski.
He's reporting on you regularly,
because he doesn't like you.
He wrote that
"by means of operational reconnaissance"
he was able to establish your...
"derogatory attitude towards
departmental holidays".
You won't ask about his wife?
How do you feel?
What do you want me to say?
Just between us, who is the father?
You or Lisowski?
The truth.
There is no such thing.
Somehow they had to earn this allotment
for the flat, didn't they?
You remember Sergeant Kania
from dactyloscopy?
Oh, and Sergeant Kania, you remember?
The one from dactyloscopy.
I thought that everyone had her...
She claims you've raped her during
the inspection journey.
Everyone had her, except for me...
because I was drunk.
And Tomala. Because he's a fag.
What else can you tell me...
The child is the most important.
- about the prosecutor...
- Nothing!
And you won't report on this Jasiak?
Still we can talk about the sugar plant.
You were right.
This is a completely different matter.
I'm glad.
For no reason.
When I get back
I am going to report a crime.
Sugar, agricultural machines,
construction materials, false invoices,
protocols of loss and damage.
A few names from the Party Committee,
the transfer rubles, dollars...
Not all signed by you
and your brother, but...
Am I mistaken, or is Srodon's case
going to be your last one, Lieutenant?
- What the fuck is this?
- What the fuck is this?
The Zootechnician's last will.
Because there is also a homicide case.
Jan Stec.
Jan Stec.
Sung so nicely in a church.
Officially died in a car accident
near Nisko.
Cold as in a Swedish Circus...
We'll make it quick,
so you won't get pissed.
Several other people died in the same
place, under same circumstances...
Perilous curve, Lieutenant.
But as for the sugar plant,
you have something on me
and I have something on you.
Let's call it a tie.
That's me in Radom.
I was salvaging the Party building.
Salvaging it?
Yeah, because they set it on fire.
Get out.
Do you know what this is?
- A gradual release of an agent... Esperal.
- Can you take it out?
With what?
Bloody cross stitches.
Sorry.
Son of a bitch.
You're allowed only
after 48 hours,
but in Mosty there was one guy...
What do you want to charge me with,
Lieutenant?
Please hide it
and return to the priest.
Give it to him.
Wozniak.
Hand me the paper.
Your testimony.
"I couldn't sleep.
The state farm, seemed uncertain.
I started doing push-ups."
Why?
To sober up I think...
Later I went out to the can,
Get some fresh air, and think.
What about?
That everything went too fast.
The deal with Dziabas.
And that I screwed his wife...
There is no such thing as happiness.
This evening didn't turn out so well.
Banas is back.
Why the hell did they bring her back?
I've already told you several times,
Lieutenant.
You know the truth.
Truth? There is no such thing.
Shit in Sanok, in Krosno
one decent doctor got interned.
She'll have to go to Rzeszow.
What's going on, Lieutenant?
Please don't drink anymore.
8 hours after waters break,
because she's primipara.
1 hour here,
an hour and a half drive,
you have 4 hours for the hospital.
Fine with you? Fine.
You aren't mad at me darling?
Wait in the van.
Banas, stay with her.
That's an order.
The suspect is lying, because
he never went to the out-house.
- No? Then where?
- There, where Dziabas lost the axe.
That's not true.
I don't want you to film me
with this.
Pick it up, you bastard.
Pick it up.
What the fuck...?
All right, so tell us your version,
Srodon.
I don't know how long
I was sitting here,
because the alcohol got to me.
A noise woke me up from the numbness.
I thought, that maybe
he wants to beat her up again.
That she had told him
about the intercourse.
The bed was empty.
I heard a scream.
Srodon, the whole bedding
has been chopped with an axe!
What axe? What're you trying
to frame me in?
Admit, you tried to kill them.
This is fucking bullshit!
Blood was everywhere...
She was standing on one side,
he over here,
holding the knife over the head.
They came to slay me
for the money in my suitcase.
Nobody knew me.
Nobody saw me.
Their son got back from partying
and passed out.
They slaughtered him.
Cut his throat in darkness.
The knife's gone.
Somebody must have poked in here.
You have a mess
in the material evidence.
Sorry.
Let's have a walk-through
one more time.
Fuck...
Where are you, bastard?
The suspect has stated,
that when Dziabas was chasing the fox,
he fell down in the mud, right?
Right.
And that the axe landed near the well.
Why the axe again?
Yes or no?
Yes.
So how could Dziabas
dash from the house with an axe?
I don't know.
Maybe he brought it in earlier?
I could have make a mistake.
Anyway, what's the difference?
They've murdered him!
- What have you done with him?
- Who allowed you to ask questions?
I want to know,
what've you done with Lieutenant?
Why aren't you taking notes?
Once again.
Where and when
did the suspect loose the axe?
- It's your fault!
- It's my fault for fifteen years!
You never loved him,
cause he wasn't yours!
But you loved him all right.
Instead of the Polonez,
you've cut his throat.
I didn't do it alone!
But you didn't recognize him
under the knife.
And it turned out perfectly,
you've killed a hoodlum!
The whole village was afraid of him.
And you too.
Probably you were provoking him!
Like Srodon.
The suitcase. We can still
make a good living off it...
and what you put away for the car.
We'll say Srodon did it.
We only have to stick together
when the militia comes.
How did you escape from the barn?
I've told you, the lighting struck,
caused a spark, the straw caught fire.
I got away at the last moment.
Like a fox...
through the fox hole.
Give me that.
You recognize this?
No.
Put it down: doesn't recognize.
Here are your collected fingerprints.
And a piece of your rain coat.
They wanted to kill me.
So I took their money.
You ordered yourself a break?
Get out, you prick.
A blow in the head with the dull side
of an axe, right-handed man.
The body was found
five meters further away...
Mrs., please move over there,
the boy too... Hawryluk, move them.
This proves...
Write it down.
that the suspect...
Damn.
Subtitles: Arigon
...could not have seen
the whole event.
- What's going on?
- Take her away.
Marysia!
- Wozniak move your ass!
- To the kitchen. Move.
They'll kill you,
during the escape.
Take her away.
Get out. Now.
You're being framed.
Beat it.
The mattress, mattress...
Quiet, quiet. Get the can...
- Lay her down.
- Put snow in the can.
- Only vodka, damn you. Get out...
- Fuck, yes sir.
Breathe slowly.
Push!
Marysia.
No...
One more time.
One more time.
It's almost here.
- One more time!
- I can't!
Yes! It's here.
