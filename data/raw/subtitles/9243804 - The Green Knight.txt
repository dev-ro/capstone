WOMAN: (WHISPERING)
Look, see a world
that holds more wonders than
any since the Earth was born.
And of all who reigned o'er,
none had renown like the boy
who pulled sword from stone.
But this is not that king...
(HOARSELY)
...nor is this his song.
Let me tell you instead
a new tale.
I'll lay it down
as I've heard it told.
Its letters sent,
its history pressed,
of an adventure
brave and bold.
Forever set,
in heart, in stone,
like all great myths of old.

That is not

No. Let it
be, today.
Its owner
is away.
Who knows when
he will return?
Please.
Good to see
you, Gawain.
Good to have one's

One's blood.
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)
Surely your
knights have
spilled enough blood
in your name
to bind them closer
to you than I.
KING: True.
But you are
my sister's boy,
queefed from
her womb.
They are not.
I look out upon my friends
here today and I see...
songs...
no muse could ever
sing or dream of.
But I turn to thee
and I see what?
I recognize but I
do not know thee.
I say this not in
reproach, but regret
that I have never asked
you to sit at my side
before this day
or upon my knee when
thy was newborn.
But now
it is Christmas,
and I wish
to build bridges.
So before
we make merry...
you make
for me a gift.
You tell me a tale of yourself,
so that I might
know thee.
(SOFT STRING MUSIC PLAYING)
I have none to tell, King.
QUEEN: Yet.
You have none

GAWAIN: Yet.
Look around you,

Do not take your place
amongst them idly.
KING: Hmm.
So who else then...
hmm?
Friends...
Brothers...
(SOFTLY) Brothers...
Brothers and...
- sisters all.
- ...sisters all.
I thank thee
for breaking bread with
me this blessed day.
And it is blessed...
for out my window
this morn I looked,
and I saw a land
shaped...
by your hands.
(DRAMATIC CHORAL MUSIC PLAYS)
You have lain those same
hands upon our Saxon brethren,
who now in your shadow
bow their heads
like babes.
Peace, peace you have
brought to your kingdom,
so it is in peace
that I...
I now say to you...
that I...
I am the luckiest
here today...
because I am
amongst thee.
I am amongst thee.
So before
we celebrate
the birth
of our Christ,
let us honor
one of our own
who has done great
things in His name.
So a tale, or...

Let whichever
of your knights
is boldest of blood

step forth,
take up arms,
and try with honor
to land a blow against me.
Whomsoever nicks me
shall lay claim
to this, my arm.
It's glory and riches
shall be thine.
But...
thy champ must bind
himself to this:
Should he land
a blow,
then one year
and Yuletide hence,
he must seek me
out yonder,
to the Green Chapel
six nights to the North.
He shall find me there
and bend the knee
and let me strike him
in return.
Be it a scratch on the cheek
or a cut on the throat,
I will return
what was given to me,
and then in trust
and friendship we shall part.
Who, then,
who is willing to engage with me?
(ALL EXCLAIM)

you expected, perhaps.
But such is the case for us all.

They're tales
I've heard,
songs that have
been sung to me.
I write them down
and sometimes...
Don't tell
anyone this.
Sometimes when I see
room for improvements...
I make them.
- Do you like books?
- Yes.
Well...
Why don't you take
one with you?
GAWAIN:
I couldn't.
Oh, but it is
nearly Christmas.
Here.
This one's for you.
I thank you.
Should not a knight offer
a lady a kiss in thanks?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Will you sit for me?
Sit for you?
For a portrait.
Ah. I've had my
portrait made already.
Not by me.
(SOMBER STRING MUSIC PLAYING)
GAWAIN: "Ant love
is to myn herte gon
"With one spere so kene..."
Hold very still.
GAWAIN: "Nyht ant day
my blod hit drynkes
"Myn herte deth me tene."
(SOMBER STRING
MUSIC CONTINUES)
That's a very
queer painting.
What's that?
GAWAIN: What?
This.
It's a token.
For what?
For good luck?
For love?
No.
LADY: Surely a knight
knows something of love.
I don't.
Truly?
(JINGLING)
(OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
LORD: Gawain!
Look what I have
brought you!
(LAUGHS)
(GRUNTS)
When I dispersed of him,
I thought what a gift!
What a gift
for my new friend.
What shall
I do with it?
Well, take it with you
for your journey.
I thought you said
it was not far.
I mean your journey
home, after.
Let us make a promise
to each other.
I hunt tomorrow
and the day after.
Whatever the forest
offers me,
I will bring you
home the best.
And you
give me in turn
whatever you might
receive here.
What might I receive here
that is not already yours?
Who knows?
This house is full
of strange things.
But then again,
I see things everywhere
that bear no logic.
Have you ever seen
a hawk kill a horse?
Just swoop
down and...
Phew. It's terrible.
Every man should see
it at least once.
But that is the world.
And the world is fit
for all manner of mysteries.
A man's home, though,
should be safe from all that.
One wall joined
with another,
line and plumb.
Good, strong walls,
and a fire within.
Why is he green,
do you think?
The knight?
Yes.
Was he born
that way?
Perhaps it is the color of
his blood when he blushes.
But why green?
Why not blue
or red?
Because he is not
of this earth.
LADY: But green
is the color of earth,
of living things,
of life.
- And of rot.
- Yes.
Yes.
(LADY CHUCKLES
SOFTLY)
We deck our halls with
it and dye our linens.
But should it come
creeping up the cobbles,
we scrub it out,
fast as we can.
When it blooms beneath our
skin, we bleed it out.
And when we,
together all,
find that our reach
has exceeded our grasp,
we cut it down,
we stamp it out,
we spread ourselves atop it
and smother it
beneath our bellies,
but it comes back.
It does not dally,
nor does it wait to
plot or conspire.
Pull it out by
the roots one day
and then next,
there it is,
creeping in around
the edges.
Whilst we're off
looking for red,
in comes green.
Red is the color
of lust,
but green is what
lust leaves behind,
in heart,
in womb.
Green is what is left
when ardor fades,
when passion dies,
when we die, too.
(BIRDS CHIRPING DISTANTLY)
When you go,
your footprints will fill with grass.
Moss shall cover
your tombstone,
and as
the sun rises,
green shall
spread over all,
in all its shades
and hues.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
This verdigris will
overtake your swords
and your coins
and your battlements
and, try as
you might,
all you hold dear
will succumb to it.
Your skin,
your bones.
Your virtue.
(WIND WHISTLING)
And what do you
hope to gain
from facing
all of this...
this hue?
Honor?
Are you asking me?
- No.
- Hmm.
Honor.
That is why a knight
does what he does.
And this is what
you want most in life?
To be a knight.
No, honor.
(CHUCKLING) You are not
very good with questions.
(SCOFFS)
It is part of
the life I want.
And this is all it takes
for that part to be had?
You'll do this one thing,
you return home
a changed man,
an honorable man?
Just like that?
Yes.
Hmm.
(SIGHING) Oh, I wish
I could see the new you.
But perhaps we will
miss our old friend
and our fun and our games.

- My lady...
- Shh.
Why did you not come
to my chambers yesterday?
GAWAIN: I couldn't.
You couldn't?
No, but...
But you wanted to.
Yes.
And now?
I would that
I could, but...
- But...
- It isn't right.
LADY: Hmm.
Isn't right.
No.
(WHISPERS) Do you
believe in magic?
What?
In witchcraft.
Do you believe in it?
Yes. I do.
It is all around us.
I have a gift
for you.
(GAWAIN BREATHES
SHAKILY)
Where did you
get that?
I made it.
(GAWAIN BREATHES
HEAVILY)
There's an enchantment
sewn into its threads.
Wear it and you will
never be struck down.
By what?
By man, or spirit,
or any other implements.
I promise,
you will not
come to harm...
as long as it is
about your waist.
Do you mean it?
- Yes.
- (BREATHING SHAKILY)
You want it? Huh.
Do you want it?
Yes.
Then tell me.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
It's okay, tell me.
I want it.
I want it.
I want it.
Good.
(GAWAIN PANTING)
Then take it.
Go on, take it.
Take it.

LORD: Gawain!
Where are you going?
I must make
my appointment.
LORD: Oh, on your
own, after all?
What of our game?
I don't want your games,
or your gifts, or your kindness.
Are you certain there is
nothing you wish to give me?
(SIGHS)
There is something.
There is something.
And I think I can
take it from you.
Unhand me
and let us
go our ways.
Very well.
Very well.
Gawain!
I... (CHUCKLES)
I caught this poor fellow
in a trap this morning.
I was going
to give him to you,
but I suppose we should
leave him to nature.
(LORD GRUNTS)
Farewell,
Sir Gawain.
And happy Christmas!
If you come back by this way
again, we shall be gone!
(FOX GRUNTS)
(FOX GROWLING)
(SNARLING)
- Why do you stop me?
- (SNARLS)
I cannot tarry.
FOX: Go that way and
your doom is at hand.
You will find no mercy.
No happy end.
What witchcraft
is this?
No witchcraft.
He you seek
is as wild as I,
but knows no measure.
I know what I face.
If any man truly knew,
he would bear his shame
happily and turn away,
head held high,
to end his song as he saw fit.
His secret would
be safe with me.
Are you this man?
No.
The spell about your
waist says otherwise.
This is just
a dirty rag.
FOX: Leave it
here, then.
GAWAIN: It was a gift.
No need for gifts
where you are headed.
Come, come home.
Come home with me.
(GAWAIN GRUNTS)
I never asked for
your company anyway!
