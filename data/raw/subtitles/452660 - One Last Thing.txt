Three... two... one...
...and the Sixers win!
That was for you Nicky...
That was all for you, my baby.
Now let's go somewhere
and celebrate for awhile.
For a long while...
You know what dude...
If I had one last wish,
I wouldn't waste it on Jason O'Malley.
I mean, he's a great football player and
everything, but you know what I would say?
I would say I'd want to nail Nicky.
Right there. Like right there.
Right there in front of everybody.
Why didn't we think of that before?
Dude, he's kidding.
Why didn't I think of that before.
You still got time, man.
No, no, no.
You can not go on television...
...saying you want to bang a supermodel.
Come on Slap. The man's dyin'.
- What is your problem?
- I'm just sayin'...
Dylan?
Let's go, okay.
Mrs. J... Lookin' hot!
Easy...
Dylan, what did I tell you
about sharing your medication.
Naw, it's okay Mrs. J...
We brought our own.
Couldn't you at least have waited
until afterwards.
I was in a lot of pain.
We all were.
All right, come on, we're late.
Where the Hell is the kid?
Jason, I need a word.
I don't care if traffic is bad, you get a helicopter.
We are 25 minutes to air!
Oh! There you are!
You... I was getting worried.
Jason...
...I want you to meet your biggest fan.
- Dylan Jamieson.
- How's it goin' man?
It's going.
So, ready to do some fishin'?
Ahh, actually...
You know there will be plenty of time
for chit-chat later.
Right now I need to get you into makeup.
Thank you.
I'm Jason.
Yeah, I know.
Thank you for doing this.
Oh, I'm honored. I just...
I hope I don't disappoint him.
Oh, are you kidding?
You've been his favorite player
since your rookie year.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah...
Well his dad started taking him
to games before he could talk.
Really.
Anyway, thank you.
You're welcome.
Dylan is 16 and hails
from Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.
He first came to our attention...
...through the pediatric oncology unit
at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.
The United Wish Givers Foundation...
...is happy to make this fine
young man's wish a reality.
So... without any further ado, I'd like
to ask Dylan to come up here and state his wish.
Dylan.
How's it goin'?
Go get 'em Suger D!
When... When I first found out
that I was getting this wish...
...I thought one of my boys
was pulling a gag on me.
But it wasn't a joke.
I also want to thank everyone,
and all the trouble they've gone through.
I know I'm supposed to get up here and say
how I want to go fishing with Jason O'Malley, but...
...it's not really what I want.
Fishing will always remind me of my pops...
And nobody, not even my favorite football
player could ever replace him.
And there is also something I realized...
...I want a whole lot more.
So, for my last wish.
I'd like to spend a weekend...
...alone... with Nikki Sinclair.
Yes!
Unbelievable bitch!
- Nikki, go on, you're beautiful.
- Did you see!
- Don't worry about her, it's all about you.
- She's on like half the runway.
She's last seasons face. I didn't book her...
I don't know who did.
I'm calling my publicist.
Honey, let me tell you.
You are the "it" girl, you are "now."
You're gorgeous.
This was made just for you,
fits you like a glove.
Book Sasha for the next show...
Honestly, could it be a little smaller?
I mean it barely fits a 12 year old boy.
Honey you should be flattered,
you look like Kate Moss.
Well you really know
how to shake up a place.
Yup.
You're honest. I'll give you that.
Just like Daddy...
You know, they give the kid his wish
when he wanted to shoot a bear.
So they can't hook me up with Nikki?
You got a point.
Well I guess hmm-them if they can't take a joke.
What them?
You know.
You mean, fuck them if they can't take a joke...
- Dylan!
- Mom, just say it!
I will not.
Just say it once please, before I go.
Fuck!
There you go. All right.
Let's get this party rollin'.
Honey, don't light that up in here.
- Come on...
- I'm serious.
You could go to jail for that.
Yeah, that really doesn't scare me anymore.
What am I going to do with you...
Bury me.
Stop.
- I kinda want you to cremate me.
- Will you stop.
Why?
We have to talk about this sooner or later.
Okay.
Tell me what you want.
You mean besides knockin' it out with Nikki?
I'm going to smack you.
I want you to take my ashes to Conquest Beach
where Pop and I used to fish.
That's a beautiful idea.
- Whoa mom!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Calm down. Keep your eye on the road,
you want some of this?
Oh terrific!
Oh God...
Get rid of that, get rid of that,
get rid of that...
I'm going to jail. I'm going to jail...
- Let me handle it.
- You be quiet. Okay.
Don't say anything about the weed.
- Ma'am, you're all over the road.
- Sorry.
All right, step out of the car please.
Officer, I know it doesn't...
Officer, Officer, Officer...
The marijuana is mine.
I'm the sole offender here, sir.
Do what you want with me,
but just leave the lady alone.
Hey, you're the wish kid.
- We saw you on TV down at the station.
- Oh yeah?
Yeah.
Got the whole 14th Precinct pullin' for ya'.
Sweet.
Okay look, there's no trouble here.
Just smoke that stuff at home from now on,
all right?
- Got it?
- Aye-aye Captain.
- Drive safe.
- Thank you.
Nice kid.
He's a nice guy.
Richie, I would not bullshit you.
- It was a accident.
- No, it wasn't.
I got to tell you it didn't look that bad.
I thought it was part of the show.
Well yeah, I thought the ambulance
was part of the show too.
I never know with you, sweetie.
Richie, darling, listen
I'll take you to lunch tomorrow, all right.
You're a genius, I love you.
Okay, ciao.
Fuck!
Am I in trouble?
Oh you passed trouble years ago.
Now you just happen to have the hottest New York
designer organizing a boycott against you.
Let me just ask you one question.
What is so sexy about self-destruction.
At first you marry a no-talent musician...
...who's been in Betty Ford more time than Gerald.
- So I made a mistake.
- A mistake?
Getting arrested twice in a month is a mistake.
Which by the way cost you
over six million dollars in endorsements.
So I made an expensive mistake.
And I suppose it was a mistake...
...saying that Mother Teresa
and other women of the cloth...
...are only nuns because they're ugly.
Have you ever seen a beautiful nun?
It's one thing to think it,
it's another thing to say it!
I work my ass off for you trying
to get you everything you ever dreamed of.
And now you are flushing it down the toilet.
You think I have everything I ever dreamed of?
You don't know anything about me.
All that you know is that
you make a shit load of money off me.
Well let me tell you something Arlene,
money ain't it.
Really? Why don't we talk about that
when you don't have any money.
Which at the rate you're going.
Is going to be really soon.
I need a glass of wine.
You want something to eat?
Scrapple?
Sandwich, or cheese on toast or somethin'?
Nah...
Hey Patti, I love you too.
I know, aren't they gorgeous.
But they're not for you,
they're for you. You have a fan.
- You want some wine.
- Yes please.
Her name's Marie. She's from Mannyunk.
That's sweet.
You read the card?
Yeah well, you know
they were sitting in my house for over an hour.
It's just too long not to look.
How ya' feelin'?
Like I just struck out.
Well you know, screw them
if they can't take a joke.
I wasn't joking.
Wow, 28 new messages.
Dude!
Make fun of the United Wish Givers,
you deserve to...
What is wrong with those people!
Well I'm going to go take a siesta.
If Nikki stops by, send her right up.
You did it man.
Oh shit...
You did it.
Dog, what's up!
Dude!
- What's happenin' fellas?
- What's happenin' D!
That was so awesome.
How'd your mom take it.
When she realized that
strangling me was kind of a waste...
...she cooled out.
Jamieson...
I don't suppose you remembered to have
Jason O'Malley sign that football, did you?
- Opps.
- Opps?
You pass on Jason O'Malley just to make...
...a joke of the United Wish Giver Foundation?
- I don't get you kids.
- I wasn't joking.
Dylan...
I'm praying for you.
We're all praying for you.
You're praying so that my boy gets laid!
I thought you guys were against
that whole kind of thing.
We're praying that you shed
the ways of the Devil and come to God.
Through Jesus Christ our savior.
I don't believe in the Devil,
and I don't believe in God.
Blasphemer!
What'd she just call you?
I will pray that you don't burn in Hell!
There's no such thing as Hell
or Heaven or Pearly Gates.
God is a rumor that somebody
made up a long time ago.
We'll gather out of his kingdom
all the unbelievers...
...and we'll cast them onto the furnace of fire!
You know you're almost hot when you're angry.
Fish, Pop!
- You got one?
- Yeah!
- All right... Reel 'em in!
- I think it's a stripper!
All right, let him run a little bit.
- I got 'em.
- You got 'em?
Oh yeah!
Look at that! Look at that!
Pop!
Dad!
Dad!
Yo' Pop, where you going?
Come back!
Come back! Come back!
- Okay. Okay...
- It's all right.
Take it easy. Nice deep breaths.
You're going to be fine.
What, I'm cured?
Yowza.
You took quite a knock on the head.
Did that bible chick deck me?
You passed out at school, honey.
Your tumors have enlarged.
And they cut off the blood supply to your brain.
That's not good, huh?
I'm afraid not.
So what now Doc, more chemo?
At this point I think that chemo...
...is going to do more harm than good.
Radiation?
We can't give you any more radiation.
You know that.
So in medical terms, I'm screwed huh?
Dylan.
We knew this point would come.
If there was anything in my power I could do,
to change it, I would.
Hey mom...
can you let us alone for just a little bit.
Sure sweetie.
I'm going to be right outside. Okay.
How long do I have?
That's hard to say.
Ballpark.
Well the science isn't pretty.
But the human will has overcome...
science for awhile.
Many times...
This is bullshit.
I need more time.
I want to see Christmas.
I want to deck the halls.
I want to chill with Nikki.
Don't we all?
I at least want to try.
Try and save your energy.
This... might be a good time
to think about the next life.
Next life?
Come on man,
you're a doctor, you believe in that crap?
Yeah. I do.
I don't.
What do you have to lose?
Screw it, I'm going to make it to Christmas.
I'll bet you a hundred bucks.
I'm not going to bet against you.
If you're not going to bet against me,
can you spot me a C-note?
I'll pay you back...
...in person. At Christmas.
I bet you will.
Oh, and... You know a nice restaurant
to take a special lady?
Yeah.
Try the Bouillabaisse.
It's the best in town.
Tell them I sent you.
Hello?
Okay.
Okay.
The United Wish Givers Foundation
got quite a surprise today...
...from 16 year old Dylan Jamieson
of Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.
It seems he changed his final wish
from a fishing trip with football star...
...Jason O'Malley to something
a bit more controversial.
There is also something...
...I realized I want a whole lot more.
So for my last wish.
I would like to spend a weekend...
...alone with... Nikki Sinclair.
What?
According to her manager, Miss Sinclair...
...is on a shoot and unavailable for comment.
Stop.
Get off me.
Look at these prices,
I haven't spent that much on a car.
Dylan, we can't eat here.
Hey. Hey, I'm taking you out to dinner.
Let's live it up some. Come on.
- Okay. Let's...
- Good.
How's it goin'?
Good evening,
may I get you something to drink?
While you decide.
I'll have a frosty cold brew.
I'm afraid I'll need some identification.
Well you know I left my wallet at the office.
Screw it, I don't want beer anyway.
Why don't you bring us a bottle of red wine.
Very good Madam.
We want the good stuff.
Nothing out of a box.
Thank you.
I feel like a bad mother,
that you're not home resting.
I've got plenty of time for that.
And right now I want a feast.
How are you going to pay for this?
Don't worry 'bout it.
Check it out... We got cloth napkins.
When was the last time we had cloth napkins.
Chateau Neuf Papes.
1985.
My personal favorite.
Oh, he's in charge.
Ahh, Bueno. Pour my good man.
Would you like to order your dinner or,
shall I come back?
No, I know what we want.
We're going to have the shrimp cocktail...
The escargot.
And I'm going to have the lobster thermador.
And the lady here
is going to have the Bouillabaisse.
Very good sir.
Dylan, we're over 200 dollars and
we haven't even got to the entree's yet.
Maybe we should skip the appetizers.
Your bill is being covered by Doctor Emerson.
Really?
Sweet.
In that case then.
- Take special care of my lady.
- Thank you, sir.
It will be my pleasure.
- Kickin'.
- Very good, sir.
To wishes come true.
Are you sure there
isn't something else you want?
Something more accessible?
What's the point of wishing,
if you don't wish for what you really want?
I just don't want you to be disappointed.
Well I will be if I don't try.
Wow.
The wine's amazing right?
The best I've ever had.
Keisha.
What would you say is the highlight,
so far, of your adult film career.
Wow, that's a hard one.
Pun intended.
Busy?
Nope.
Can I sit?
I have a present for you...
...and he wanted me to give
this to you on your 18h birthday.
I don't think he would mind
if I gave it to you now.
Thanks.
Happy Birthday, Dylan.
I wish I could be there with you.
I guess God has other plans.
I know you and
I never talked much about God.
I probably should have taken you
to church a little more.
But I never really cared for it.
I do believe in a life after this one.
And that's where I am now.
It's pretty nice here.
Fishing's fantastic.
I'll take you sometime.
But don't hurry.
Don't you dare hurry.
I'm not going anywhere.
You know I've had a good life.
Caught my stripped bass.
I had a hole in one.
Saw the Phillies win the world series.
It would have been nice to see
the Eagles win the Superbowl, but...
...you'll probably live
a hundred years and never see that.
Bunch of bums.
Smartest thing
I ever did was marry your mother.
Little piece of advice. When you...
When you really fall for a woman,
Even if you think you don't have a chance in Hell.
Just take a shot.
Marry the woman you love.
Love the woman you marry.
Do something nice for her,
when she least expects it.
Life will be good.
Trust me.
D!
...I don't want your mother to be alone.
If she meets a good man, give him your respect.
Shut up.
If he's a bum, put his ass in the curb.
Remember... even though I'm not there...
I'm with you every step along the way.
Bullshit.
That's not bullshit
And one last thing.
If you, remember only one thing that I say.
Remember this.
Fuck!
- Shit.
- Dude, it's going to be all right.
Shut the fuck up, man.
It's not going to be okay.
What's the matter?
It ate the tape!
This fucking piece of shit ate the tape!
I'm sorry...
I can't do this, let's just turn around.
- You can do this.
- No, I can't.
You will do this.
Arlene, come on, the kid is dying.
Yeah, and you've been given a golden opportunity
to make him happy and possibly save your career.
Don't blow it.
Well, this used to fit.
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you.
- Good...
- I'm Arlene.
This is Nikki and Alex her photographer.
I'm Karen Jamieson, this is my friend Patti.
Hi, nice to meet you.
It's so nice of you to come.
Well it's the least I could do.
Could I get you something to drink?
Scotch, if you have it.
How about a wine cooler?
Never mind...
Yo' what up baby...
Dude it doesn't matter what you wear, man.
Just be cool.
You know, like pretend she isn't even there.
Shut up.
Oh here he is.
- Dylan. Hi.
- Hi.
- How's it going?
- Good.
Thanks for coming by.
Oh well,
I just happen to be in the neighborhood.
Good one.
Ahh... so you wanna go out to dinner?
There's a place close
by with really good Bouillabaisse.
You don't waste any time, do you.
Yeah, well...
You know... I would actually love to
but we really can't stay.
We would have planned for more time...
...but your announcement kinda
caught us by surprise.
Can't you just stay for a little longer.
You know Dylan,
they came all the way from New York...
...and that's nothin' to sneeze at.
Hey why don't we get a picture?
Let's get a picture of the two of you.
That'd be great.
Right over...
Okay...
- This good?
- Yeah, yeah.
Can I have a card please.
Anyway, this is my card.
And it's got my agency number on it.
So if you come to New York...
...you can just call that number...
And we'll get together then, okay?
Well, it was really great meeting you.
You take care.
- Thank you. Great meeting you.
- Thank you for coming.
Bye.
I'm so sorry...
We're just in a bit of a time crunch. So...
Yeah, I know what that's like.
- Oh, I'll walk you out.
- Thanks. See ya.
Forget her man, really,
she was not as hot in person anyway.
Was the dumbest thing you've ever said.
Yeah, seriously dude...
Sayin' stupid shit like that
is not going to make him feel any better.
Honestly D.
It was amazing man.
I swear to God,
I thought I was going to pass out.
She even smelled perfect.
I couldn't feel my legs.
All right, just forget her...
Just forget her.
Listen, all right we did our research...
And we're pretty sure... that Danielle Figgis,
Cathy Ryan,
and Michelle Flogwater will do you.
Cathy Ryan, she has a nice rack
and she wants to be a nurse.
I mean, come on, she's my top draft pick.
She's a lay up bro'.
I don't want a lay-up.
I want Nikki.
Okay, look. Alex is going to be there
with the photos in a couple of hours.
The second they arrive I want them
all over the wires. All right.
And I want you all over the phones,
I mean, this is front page stuff, Laura.
All right. Hook me up. Don't let me down.
Thanks.
Have some water.
I know you're upset, I understand.
That poor kid.
That poor dying kid who we just blew off.
You know...
You did a good thing. Don't ruin it.
Dude, I don't give a shit
if you're dying man, you're driving me nuts.
I'm gonna haunt your ass.
Dude, haunt me too.
...having a New York moment...
I got to get to New York.
All right. I'm down. Huh, let's do it.
I'm broke.
Actually, I've got like 55 bucks.
55 bucks won't get us to Trenton.
And if we go to New York,
we got to do it right. Live large.
I could probably scare up a few shekels.
I could get a cheaper funeral.
- Dude... Dude...
- You got any better ideas?
...I'm really excited,
'cause I get to work with Jane Fondle...
...and Rock Studson.
We've been practicing really hard every day.
Cable access rules!
You know for fifty bucks you can get
a half hour to do what ever you want.
You know fifty bucks,
a couple of porn stars man.
And bang, you're rich and you're famous.
You get more ass than a toilet seat.
Okay, so let's do it!
I don't know any porn stars, man.
No, but if we buy half-hour cable access.
And we do one of those auctions
like they do on PBS.
Dude, those things suck.
They suck because they sell tote-bags...
...but if we get some good stuff to sell,
who knows.
What do you got to sell man?
I have two autographed baseballs.
A signed Nikki picture, and...
...a lot of other stuff I won't need.
We could wash cars...
You know, do whatever...
...bullshit work someone needs done.
And any maybe there'd be like, this hot...
...divorce chick right, with a nice rack...
...wanting me to do stuff for her.
Could you imagine that?
Not be needing these.
Oh and I have that Eagles autographed football.
I mean, that's got to be worth something.
You serious?
What the Hell am I going to do with it?
Do you guys remember that time when...
...when we were at the Eagles game
and they were getting crushed...
...so everyone started
to pelt Santa with snowballs.
That was the bomb man!
Dude, don't say the bomb, man. That's over.
Sorry. Homes.
Where do you want us to go,
over here by the picnic table?
That's great kids, you guys look so cute.
She looks fantastic.
That is the most beautiful flower
I have ever seen.
Well I ordered it special.
It's called a red beauty.
Just like you, baby.
Hold still, hold still.
You better not hurt my baby.
I'd rather die.
Let's just skip the prom,
let's go get married.
Okay.
Ma'am.
I promise I'll be real good to your girl.
Can I have her hand in marriage?
You'll have my hand upside
your head in a minute.
Mama, don't you want us
to get married someday?
I'll wait for you forever.
Unless you go to New York,
leave me in the dust.
Bo, I would never do that.
- Ready?
- Bye Mama. Love you.
I love you. Have a good time.
Yo J. I heard you gettin' traded to New York...
for a supermodel.
I guess that would make this an all girl team.
Got jokes, the guy...
Call right now...
And this autographed Eagles football
is yours for only 300 bucks.
Now this is a real collectors item.
One of the meanest Eagles teams of all time.
The 1991 Eagles. We're talking Reggie White.
Jerome Brown. Seth Joiner.
All Hall of Famers. Very nice ball.
Okay, 200!
And that's less than... my old man paid
for this thing. Now come on.
Maybe we should try something else.
If we can't sell this...
...how we gonna sell any of this other crap?
Shit... take over.
Hi. Is your remote control sticky?
Does it smell like feet?
Look at it right now.
Well... We got a new special offer...
We will clean and sanitize
your remote for fifty dollars.
Or if you call in the next fifteen minutes.
We will clean your remote...
...and we'll clean your bong
for only 100 dollars!
Ahh, Weekend with Nikki.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
What's next...
Here we go, Next.
Two quality adult videos.
The first one, the classic,
"Booty and the beast."
And my personal favorite... "Laurel's Canyon."
25 dollars each.
Or together..in a box set for 50.
Hold on.
Umm... Fellas...
There's a guy here who ahh...
...wants to buy the football for ten grand.
Well, he's serious.
Okay, that's good.
Now let go with your right hand.
Lean back.
You're going to jump...
...you're going to make
the ultimate fashion statement.
Give me that look...
Come on, look at me.
Give me defiance.
Give me impertinence.
Take five people!
How we doing?
Come see for yourself.
You got to be kidding me,
this is all you've got?
She was an hour and half late.
Jesus, she looks like shit.
I can't use these.
I thought I booked
the gorgeous Nikki for this shoot.
She's dead.
Where is she going?
Where the Hell are you going!
Somebody...
would you get me Arlene on the phone!
What kind of a mother would I be...
...if I let you go to New York all by yourself.
I'm not going by myself,
Slap and Ricky are coming with me.
Oh, now I feel much better.
Are you kidding me?
No way, absolutely not.
Mom, I'm going to New York.
What if no one shows up with the money.
Then I walk there.
Say grace.
Thanks. Amen.
Do you really think
she's going to go out on a date with you?
If you'd seen Dad's tape, you'd understand.
What do you mean?
He said that when he wanted to ask you out...
...he didn't think he had a shot.
But he did it anyway.
And it turned out to be the best thing he ever did.
- He said that?
- Yeah.
Come on in.
What's the deal little brother.
How's it goin'?
Good. I came to pick up my football.
I can't believe you have one of those, man.
Of all the dumb luck.
- That was you?
- Yeah.
This... is the address of the Omni Hotel.
Your room is on me.
And this is for everything else.
Sweet! Man, thanks.
Thank me by having a great time.
We can't take your money.
Oh sure you can, Karen. Come on.
I really don't think so.
Yeah, come on mom. You heard the man.
Dylan, I don't like the idea
of you running around New York...
...with a bunch of money in your pocket.
Anything could happen.
That's the idea.
You know what I mean.
Mom, worst case scenario...
I get shot and have a quick and merciful death.
Boy that would suck.
Is there a hockey game on TV?
No.
Then why don't you take you dinner
and go find something else.
You're such a kill-joy.
Mom...
Thank you.
You're trying to help and I appreciate it.
But you can't just hand Dylan a stack of money
and tell him to skip off to New York...
...and find himself a supermodel and
expect me to think it's okay.
Please take this back.
Can't.
Deal's a deal, Karen.
I'll come back later for the football.
Bye.
He's at the thirty, the twenty...
she could go all the way!
Tolliver gets her from behind.
I love it when you do that.
What, get you from behind?
No... well yeah.
No, it's just when you hold me like this.
It makes me feel safe.
I'm never letting you go, Nik'.
Promise.
I promise. Yeah, I promise.
You and me, we're gonna get married.
And we're gonna have a bunch of babies.
Grow old and fat together.
It's amazing how time flies.
Seems like just yesterday you were calling me
from New York telling me we had to see other people.
I was gettin' hammered...
...and crashing Bobby's Bronco.
Spillin' my brains all over Route 40.
Seriously, I don't see the big deal guys,
this ain't no different than Philly.
The place smells better, man.
That's 'cause we don't have
the Rangers stinking up the joint.
Yo' dude, chill out all right.
You're gonna get your ass kicked
the first ten minutes we're here.
Let's go Flyers! Let's go!
Come on man...
This is bangin'.
She's here...
- Hey, easy pal!
- That was ours.
That guy just stole our cab.
Come on.
Where we goin' fellas?
Ahh, the Omni Motel.
The Omni's a hotel.
Motel, Hotel, what's the difference, right?
Oh you'll see when you get there.
I love this place.
Hey, could you take us to a strip club?
I can take you where ever you want to go.
You boys look familiar,
you all part of a boy band or somethin'?
No man...
I've seen you before, I know it.
We got a TV show in Philly.
You're the wish kid!
People in New York know you D!
You better believe it...
...your picture's on the cover of the post.
Dude, it's official man, you're famous.
- That's insane!
- That's awesome!
I want to be on the Post, man.
This will work, man.
See you fellas later.
Hey. Hey!
Hey stop! Stop God damn it!
What's up Kid?
What the Hell is going on here?
You on somethin' boy?
D', man you okay?
There's some bizarre shit going on right now.
Come on, let's get inside.
Good idea.
Hello Mister Jamieson.
Welcome to the Omni.
This is your bathroom, your bar...
...your remote.
Your second bedroom is down that hall.
Damn, a motel room with two bedrooms.
- This is a suite.
- I'll say.
You guys haven't been
to New York before, have you.
Nah, just New Jersey.
Gentlemen...
You're in the greatest city in the world.
If you want or need anything.
Let me know.
Well how about a good strip club.
We can't get into a strip club.
Go to Skins.
Tell them Edson sent you.
Seriously?
Like I said, whatever you need.
Thank you.
Thanks, that's very kind.
If I were you... I wouldn't walk around the city
with that much cash.
Let me show you how to use the safe.
Nah man, we have lockers, we'll figure it out.
Gentlemen...
Have a good day.
I love that guy, man!
All right, let's go, let's hit the town!
Dude, what is your hurry, man?
Ahh, the brother just hooked us
up with a strip club, man.
That's my hurry. Now let's go, let's hit it!
Where's D, man?
Yo D!
Yo.
Not yet, not fuckin' yet.
Come on man, let's hit it.
Nah, I'm wiped. I got to lay down.
You okay man?
Yeah, no, you guy go. I got to...
I got to crash here.
All right. All right.
Well she's right,
you do look like shit.
Nikki... you got to lay off the booze.
It's the only way I can get to sleep.
Passing out isn't sleeping.
Sweetheart, you need some professional help.
If you need any doctor referrals,
anything, just let me know...
...but you got to take some time off.
I don't want time off.
Take it.
No one's hiring you anyway.
Why don't you do you job
and change their mind.
I do, do my job... very well. Thank you.
You know, Nikki...
I have other clients.
Appreciative clients.
That I actually can book.
So what are you saying?
You're saying you're dropping me?
If you don't get your shit together, I am.
Lifes too short, I don't need this.
You're right.
I do need some time off.
- Sorry...
- Jesus Christ!
I knocked, and I figured you couldn't hear me...
- You gave me a heart attack.
- I'm sorry.
So you always read to Heavy Metal?
I don't like the quiet.
You okay?
I'm far from okay.
- He should have called by now.
- Well...
If anything happens to him
I will never forgive myself. I...
Karen. Karen. Karen.
Listen to me.
Something is going to happen to him.
Very soon.
Can't part of you wish he's having a good time?
You don't have kids do you?
No.
It's so quiet when he's not here.
So... let's go to Atlantic City.
If you're buyin', I'm flyin'.
Dude, we can not go to Atlantic city, man.
All right, let's go to Mexico City.
Here'd you boys get all your money from?
Well, we umm...
have a TV show in Philly that we do.
A couple of celebrities, huh?
Well actually our boy,
Dylan, is kind of the celebrity.
He is the kid...
...that wanted to nail...
spend the weekend with Nikki.
- He's cute.
- Yeah, isn't he?
If Nikki won't do him, I will.
I'll fuck him...
...until his eyes roll out of his head.
And I'll join you.
Oh mommy!
- Call him.
- What?
- Call him.
- Dude, call him!
- What's the number?
- I don't know.
Well you're good at math, dude!
Yo' call information.
- What's the name of that place again?
- Omni Hotel.
All right... the Omni...
I freelance there.
Hello?
- Dude!
- Hi Dylan!
Yo' dude, we are at Skins,
come down here right now, man.
Ah shit, I got to go.
What, where?
What are you talking about man?
No, no, no. Give me that phone.
D! D! Listen man, you better
get your skinny ass down here, bro'.
I'm looking at two of the hottest
chicks I've ever seen, man,
and they want to snap you bean!
Together!
Together. Right.
No, no, D' Man, I'm serious.
They saw you on TV, man. They dig you!
- D' listen!
- Put Slap on.
You talk to him.
- Hi Dylan.
- Hi, how's it goin'.
Can you put on Slap please.
- Yeah, what's up, man.
- Remember this address.
24th and Madison.
I'm going to be there in like half an hour.
Dude, shut up man. Just come down here,
I swear to God, you'll forget all about Nikki.
I can't do it Slap, do whatever you want,
but I got to jam.
Dude. What? D! Dude!
- What's the deal, man?
- We got to go, okay...
Ladies, I'm so sorry.
We've been called to another meeting.
I need to do this, but I'm sorry...
Thank you.
No, no, no, no.
Amber... could we get one more table dance.
We just got to go, man.
Let's take five minutes...
Slap. Do you have any more money, man?
I thought you had the rest, man.
Are you telling me
we just blew through eight bills, that fast?
- Come on, man.
- That is awesome.
Amber.
Do you mind if I just take one of these...
- No.
- Amber... Come on...
My friend and I just spent
many monies on you this evening.
- If we could just get a little bit back for cab fare.
- Fuck off!
Amber, come on, it's us.
- Arnie!
- Okay, now we got to go man!
You son of a bitch! Arnie!
- We're gonna get you, you little pricks!
- Arnie!
Two.
Hey, that's you ain't it?
No.
Hey, you want your change?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
You okay?
I'm fine.
You don't look fine, you look like shit.
I got to go.
Whoa, come on...
Come on. Come on.
Relax, take deep breaths.
Here.
It's not coincidence, you know?
What isn't?
That you're here, right now.
Oh no...
What?
Ever since I came to this city,
weird shit has been happening to me.
I saw a dead woman wink at me.
I see my dead father everywhere I go.
And now some lunatic in a dress
is messing with me.
Death is nothing to fear.
So did you see me on TV?
I don't own a TV.
You see me in the Post?
Does it look like I read the Post?
Then how do you know?
It's obvious.
You're in a re-birth.
This is a very exciting time.
Not for me it isn't. It's a sucky time.
I don't want to die.
No. No one does.
But everyone will.
And you'll be reborn again and again.
That's bullshit,
I'm going to die and shrivel up.
You're not one of those
Hari Krishna dudes are you?
I don't even own a tambourine.
Here...
What is it?
Shiva. The destroyer and giver or life.
Scary lookin' dude.
That's the destroyer part of him. Flip it over.
Who's the babe?
Pavarti. His wife.
Shiva gets his power from their lovemaking.
Sweet.
- So I can keep this?
- No.
Your whole rap was to sell me something?
Aren't you a little young to be so jaded?
Aren't you a little old not to be?
You can have it, on the condition
that you give it to someone before you move on.
It's been passed on for 300 years.
Don't blow the streak.
We're all born with the weight
of death on our shoulders.
But most people live like death doesn't exist.
And when it comes, they're unprepared.
Like you, they fight it.
When you're born,
you cry and the world is happy.
When you die the world cries,
and you are happy.
Gotta go...
Maybe he's getting ready for you.
Who?
You're father.
That wasn't my father,
and there is no after-life, okay.
Earl's sister and I worked together
as secretaries at the refinery.
And she set us up on a blind date.
I walked into the bar...
...and I knew right away which one he was.
He was very handsome,
he had a smile that lit up the whole room.
He used to light up this whole place.
We talked about moving,
but for Earl the most important thing
was to have enough for Dylan's college.
So we just stayed put.
My old man worked in a steel mill, Youngstown.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I worked there a few summers.
Man, it was the toughest job I've ever done.
A lot tougher than tackling people for a living.
Sometimes when I'm out here,
I swear I hear Earl's voice.
- Boys.
- Yo'. Where you been man?
I don't know.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I just you guys to know that there's a very
good chance that I might be losing my mind.
Yeah, no shit, Dude.
You just passed up two hot chicks to buy flowers.
- Let it go.
- Hello Axis. May I help you?
Yeah, flower delivery.
Dude, I'm telling you,
you don't know what you passed up.
I didn't come here to settle.
Dude, how is a threesome
with two amazing chicks settling.
You are outta your mind.
Jesus.
- What's up ladies.
- Shut up.
Just be cool, okay.
- All right.
- Cool.
How's it goin'.
Ahh, these are for Nikki.
Great.
Just leave them on the table, okay.
Actually we need to give them to her in person.
Do you know how many times I hear that?
No... He really does though.
Please, leave your offering
over there on the table.
And I'm sure she'll call
you back real soon. Have a nice day.
Could we get her home address.
Okay... Brianna.
Brianna, yes.
They're ready for you now, okay.
Goodbye, ciao. Good luck.
- No, this is kinda important.
- I'm sure it is.
But it's not as important
as me keeping my job.
Okay, don't you know who this guy is, man?
Ahh, the wish boy.
You sure you want
to waste your last wish on her?
Hey man, easy.
If you know, what I know. You know.
I know what I know, you know?
Papi... You got it bad, no?
Man, please... help us out.
Honey, honey... you're going to get hurt.
That's all I'm saying, okay?
Please.
I can not tell you her address.
But you know the Club Lot 61?
If you go there tonight.
I have a feeling you're going to see her there.
But, get there early.
She's not happy, drunk.
You know what I mean?
Thanks.
Oh no, thank you. Good luck.
We named Dylan after Dylan Thomas.
I was a little skittish about naming my son...
...after a notorious drunk.
But Earl liked it, so...
Makes me crazy when people think
we named him after a whiny singer.
It's clear out here, tonight.
Yeah.
Oh shit man, I think that's Derek Jeter.
You better find Nikki before he does, man.
Forget him, you get in there
and knock her off her feet.
It's sweep her off her feet.
How's it goin'?
Hit the road.
Is Nikki here tonight?
I said, hit the road.
Okay, there's got to be something we can do.
Big dog!
Ladies...
I'll give you twice what he just gave you.
- You're going to give me two bills.
- Yeah.
Whoa Chachi, be subtle.
How's it goin'.
Good.
You have ID?
I just gave you 200 bucks!
You got ID or not?
Yes, I do.
What's this?
See that guy standing next to Nikki?
That's me.
I'll be damned.
So I can get in now?
Pull your hat down and lay low.
You 'cause any trouble, you're a dead man.
Is that some kind of threat?
Yo'. My bad.
So my boys can come too?
That's not going to happen.
Hey come on...
Hey, are you dyin'?
No.
You will be if you don't shut your mouth.
Look you don't want these clowns
hangin' around you anyway.
Get in there sugar D.
Make Marcus Hook proud.
For the Hook.
One night in San Tropez,
I spent $20,000 dollars, just on champagne.
When you have enough money to spray cases
of Kristal on your friends, that says something.
It sure does.
I made it to New York.
I can see that.
Take off kid.
I hear your mommy calling you.
Actually that's your mommy calling me.
Little minx won't leave me alone.
Can we talk?
- Bye-bye.
- Are you serious?
Yeah, you're kinda boring me.
Why don't you go spray some champagne?
Yeah, well...
...you're not that hot in person.
I love men.
You want me to kick his ass?
What I want is for you to go home.
Not until you give me a chance.
Look... you're a really cute boy.
I'm sure there are tons of girls back
home that would love to go out with you.
I don't want to be with anyone else.
Dylan, how long do you have to live?
What difference does that make?
Because whatever it is,
please, don't waste it on me.
It's not a waste.
I'm in love with you.
You're obsessed with a fantasy of me.
Okay, that's not love.
It could be if you give me a chance.
I am a total bitch, ask anybody.
I don't believe that.
Look, I don't want to hurt you.
But you can't be in love with me.
It's way too late for that.
- You don't know what being in love is.
- Do you?
I did.
Once.
But I left him.
For this.
There's this beach that
my dad and I used to go to...
And you can go for days and not hear
anything but the waves and the birds.
I'm only going there once more.
And I want you to come with me.
You're really sweet.
But you're really putting me in a bad spot.
And I just can't handle that right now.
So...
Just go home.
And I thought I was the one dying.
Take care of yourself.
Dude, let's go back to Skins.
Oh yeah, so we can get our asses kicked.
Dude, it's probably different chicks.
You're out of your mind.
Hey, let's remember why we're here.
All right.
We're livin' like we're gonna die.
How about not rushing it?
- D'!
- Dude, you see her?
Yeah.
And?
D', where you goin' man?
- Home.
- What?
Dude, we're in New York, man.
Let's hit the town.
- Nah.
- Look... I'm sorry you struck out, man.
But you went for it... with a supermodel!
You got to be the only sophomore
in the world who can say that!
And you tell me I say stupid shit?
- Dude, put your head back.
- Sit down.
You all right, man?
God damn it...
That is the most beautiful flower
I have ever seen.
I ordered it special.
It's called a red beauty.
Just like you, baby.
You better not hurt my baby.
I'd rather die.
Let's just skip the prom, go get married.
Okay.
Ma'am. I promise I'll be real good to your girl.
Can I have her hand in marriage?
You're going to have my head
upside your head in a minute.
Mama.
- Ready?
- Come on.
Bye mama, I love you.
I love you.
Sure you don't want to get a cab, D?
No, we're almost there.
You know we could get a limo,
we still have boo-coo dinero left, guys.
Jesus... You're right. Let's go back to Skins.
Hey, I was talkin' to D, thank you.
Let's throw a massive party.
Rock the Hook to the ground one more time.
Yeah... Yeah, a party with strippers.
No dude, fuck that, let's throw my funeral.
Oh, a funeral with strippers, that's tight!
That is sick!
No dude, you should enjoy your funeral,
because if people have nice things
to say about you...
...you should be there to hear them.
- Oh shit...
- Hey you little pricks, where is my money?
Step off Ace, we ain't givin' you shit!
No, D chill man.
Do you believe the balls
on this little prick?
Look at his face,
he likes to get his ass kicked!
You want to kick some ass, kick mine.
We will!
These guys mean business!
So do I, come on bitch, let's go!
- Who you callin' a bitch?
- You bitch!
What are you trying to do!
Where's the money?
Come here! Come on!
Give me the God damn money!
What the Hell is the matter with you?
Oh shit he's a bleeder!
I didn't even touch you.
I'm not going out like a little bitch...
If they want my money...
They have to kill me!
Actually... We kinda owe them some money.
What?
Yeah, we kinda ran out of money
at the strip club...
...and we didn't have enough for cab fare,
so ahh... we had to take some back.
Shit...
- Let's go.
- Sorry...
Sorry don't clean this coat, let's go.
Cough it up.
- Get outta here...
- That's what I thought.
I don't want to see you punks no more,
in my club, all right!
Yeah, you won't.
Come on, let's get outta here.
You okay man?
You all right, D?
Let's get back to the Hook, man.
I heard that.
Fellas...
Need a ride?
Yeah, could you take us to Marcus Hook?
Where?
Just outside of Philadelphia.
Can you take us?
You got the cheese, I got the speed. Come on.
Come on Sugar D.
You're being too hard on yourself, girl.
What?
It isn't your time yet.
What are you talking about?
You know you're going
to be a Grandma someday.
Are you shroomin'?
Open your mouth.
I have a surprise for ya'.
That's what I thought.
Good morning.
Hey, how you feelin'?
I don't know,
how did I get here?
You got here by cab, man.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Go home, get some sleep.
Don't worry about me,
you're the one that needs to rest.
I just did. Now I gotta go.
Dylan, you must rest.
Can't I got a funeral to throw.
Sweetie... Sweetie... Sweetie...
Okay, resting's good.
Nice Shiva.
Where did you learn about Shiva?
You really believe that stuff?
Yes...
What's up, Doc?
Am I getting pulled from the game.
Well Dylan...
You're on the verge of
a total system breakdown.
Or cardiac arrest.
Depending on which tumor decides..
To assert itself.
Hi.
Hey.
Can I come in?
Sure.
I'm going to be in the lobby, okay?
Come on Boys.
- No...
- Come on...
I'm sorry.
I hope you don't hate me.
Hate you?
I could never hate you.
You're my girl.
I'm going to love you for the rest of my life.
You're a sweet soul.
And cute too.
If you were ten years older...
I'd be dead.
Sorry.
You got a car?
Where are you going?
Going for a drive.
- Dylan...
- Mom.
Mom... let me go.
Please.
I love you, mom.
I love you too.
I'll take good care of him.
You better.
Yo' D.
Catch you on the flip-flop fellas.
Where you goin' man?
Fishin'.
What?
Why?
Somebody woke me up.
If this isn't Heaven, I don't want to go.
It's beautiful.
The tide is perfect.
I hope you like fish for dinner.
Are you okay?
Never been better.
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
- You okay?
- Yeah, take it. Take it.
I can't...
Oh shit!
My God, I think you caught a whale!
Striper, you got a Striper.
Keep the line taught
if he starts to make a run.
He's not going anywhere!
Come to mama baby!
- He's making a run!
- No!
To the best day of my life.
Me too.
I hope you get a wish
that comes true someday.
I already did.
I want you to have this.
Wow.
It's beautiful.
Where'd you get it?
This crazy guy in New York.
I love when you smile.
If this is a dream,
I don't ever want to wake up.
Guess it's real.
Easy, we got all night.
You better pinch me again.
Dylan?
Couldn't you have made
the smile a little more... subtle?
We tried. We couldn't change it.
I've never seen anything like it.
- I'm tellin' you...
- Shut up...
- Dude, I swear I saw him breathe.
- Come on...
Take it easy D.
I love you brother.
Save a place up there for me, man.
I miss you, man.
And I know how you wanted
to bring your fishing pole with you.
We looked for it,
but we couldn't find it.
But when I do,
I'll make sure to bring it with me, okay?
Love you man.
You okay?
It's about time!
Is it really you?
Who were you expecting?
A supermodel?
Huh? Come on.
- Missed you pop.
- Missed you too.
That was you in New York, huh?
What you talkin' about?
Hey Emmett, that's a beauty!
Ain't it.
This is what I call the catch of the day.
Come on!
- Pop?
- Yeah?
How do I know this isn't a dream?
You don't. And you never will.
Come on, the tide is perfect.
We're going to catch us
some serious fish, you ready?
