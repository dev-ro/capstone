We did not lose the contact
- You look good!
- I do.
For what you are
waiting, is better.
Working too much, Capucine?
Not much extends the rope.
- Leave it.
- No, let me get it.
What have you got? A wild boar?
Do not be modest, it is your work.
Giraudet insists there is a

bookstore, On Monday in the afternoon.
He is afraid that
you miss material,
then ... this is the delivery.

other place than in this mess.
- Still writes by hand?
- Always.
- Where is Donna.?
- Up there in his corner.
Works like a dog.
- Continues to love her?
- Increasingly.
She is a saint.
Not only that ... but she is a saint.
Not only that, what?
Capucine!
Capucine, how I'm happy to see you.
Let me see, you're younger!
Not much, I hope. No
want to look ridiculous.
The old age begins when
started to say ...
"I never felt that
as young as now. "
You bored with me
that their citations.
This is Jules Renard,
my smart.
You are very known.
- No, not with the language.
- I never said that.
Stop it, both.
I'm getting excited.
What do you want doing
Charles working on a Sunday?
Yes, what are you thinking?
Even more on TV to cable.
Bright. From what Henry said,
Channel is the Provincial
what is the best.
Question of image.
Question of image, what
are you talking about? I'm dreaming!
- And matter of hassle, is what?
- I will have an attack.
You know
Bernard from the school,
and Volte, which will
interview you, is very good.
- You never see him?
- Never, it is unforgivable ...
You know how he
hates the television.
Listen, you do not want to be part
of the media circle in Paris,
hiding in the village, but want to
sell your books .
Then do a little effort.
Gently.
I am thirsty.
And the good news is that
it seems that this time good
will extend
throughout the week.
We also have our
'Indian Summer'. Until tomorrow.
Gabrielle  Thank you,
she's the sun of our channel.  
 remind you of
event tonight,  
after the newspaper of
Benoît Charpentier.
 Antoine Volt, receive
Live in studio,  
the writer Charles Saint-Denis,
that will give us the great pleasure of
present his next book.
So, Miss Gabrielle,

Sure, Benoît, four times the
day, the hour of meals.
- Four times?
- Yes, no forgetting my lunch.
- Benoit, Wait for you
I already come-
Except for the bell!
Tomorrow, 13 hours
At cafe "L'Horloge."
Call you tomorrow morning?
You will not want to compromise,
Be smart

Cendrine.
Shit, sorry.
I thought there was nobody.
- But please, be welcome.
- Sit down, I'm done.
No, I do not want to bother.
I take a makeup later.
Please stay.
Do not bother me.
So my old, is everything okay?
I am in the hands of a fairy
that treats me like a king.
Go on, my friend.
We know from the school.
Remember Father Gorio ?
No, Gregorio! As if I do not remember?
He did everything
In order that I will not forget him
He used to insert his hand
Into my pants
and the other boys.
At that time was like.
- How many years have?
It was the primary, there were
22, 23 years ago?
We were a few boys.
It is disgusting.
I just talk to Antoine,
he loved your book.
Good. And you read it?
Talk about this later.
He did not read it.
 If I may, let me not introduce
your book, but about you.  
- You like that?
- What?
What you speak of?
A little but not much.
So you do not miss
 Paris and its lights?
But Lyon is not an obscure city.
You continue to write
for the "Nouvel Observateur"?
They have the kindness
to ask my opinion
on topics of interest.
Well, imagine that you do not
do it for the money.
Basically, Charles Saint-Denis,
what motivates you?
The contact with reality.
It is a big problem
for writers, you know?
I take life of a nun.
Precisely, what is the matter
now that the matter?
I wonder if the company
French is directed to ...
the puritanical or decay.
Yes, a very wide.
Especially for a nun.
One last question,
if I may ...
It is indicated to the Prix Goncourt?
- He has already received.
- Yes, you won.
Congratulations, by the way. Can we
remember in what year was it?
In 1969, a Magical year.
And it was!
And the French Academy,
interests you?
As you know,
I like quotes
so I will tell you.
Piron you know?
This playwright of the 18th century,
author of "La Métromanie."
But of course, Piron.
Okay, this brave Piron
he even wrote his epitaph:
"Here lies Piron was not
nothing, not even academic "
Thank you, thank you.
- It is a joy revise it.
- Mr Mayor, how are you?
- Not afraid to commit?
- Why?
The jerk of Fontaine saying goes
that Jacques is an imposter.
Shit, and what are you gonna do?
What if you normally do,
do not worry.
What the Lídia doing here?
It seems that she is
hunting down someone.
How so?
Not that it is boring,
but I gotta go.
- Mr Mayor, excuse me ...
- Yeah, right.
Well, kids, just to
joke, waiting for me,
at the banquet of ex-combatants.
And not having fun with it.
- Professor, I would like ...
- Excuse me. Charles.
I'd like to give a
word with Vaillant,  
he did a good
criticism of your book.
- It's that wonderful girl.
- Who?
What you followed with his eyes.
 This champagne is hot.  
- Who is?
- She is called Gabrielle Deneige.
It is a fated name. She
is the 'weather girl'.
But I bet with you
she will not be there.
- So, are you having fun?
- And you?
We have a good laughs with
Capucine. But now I gotta go.
- The train leaves at 9 o'clock in the morning.
- You leave me again?
To the best
reconnect, my child.
I will give a more
back and let's go.
- Can I go alone, if you want?
- No, I will close.
I hope for you in the lobby.
He is a unanimous decision, my dear.
- All against me.
- Pathetic.
Where is Donna?
She waits for me along
entry. Wait for us?
Bernard will take me to
dinner, and then go home.
- Always insatiable ...
- I am free, it is all.
Until tomorrow.
Do not do this guy.
You had promised me that
you didn't do that anymore.
You know well that I can not
keep my promises.
- Ask my dear mother.
- Your mother still will say goodbye!
If she send out
the front door,
I do it through by the back.
- She is sleeping?
- Josephine rose ...
but this in the Eleonore
room with his mother.
Ah! my God!
Paul, where were you ?
I wonder why

- Are you hungry?
No. I ate at a reception.
Speak, as in the Saint-Denis?
- Not bad for his age.
- Look there!
- Just kidding, Mom.
- He is a good writer, you know?
He has a great
sense of narrative.
His style is somewhat antiquated,
but, undeniably,
he has talent.
Very good the report.
I know of things.
He is a 'bon vivant'.
This means that
he likes women?
In any case,
he loves his wife.
One of his books more
beautiful is dedicated to her.
- Why are we talking about it?
- I saw the program ...
... how stupid
that Antoine Volte!
Is not outdated.
Well, I will throw.
- Come tomorrow?
- In that same hour?
16 hours. He comes to 16,
come a little sooner.
Okay. Good night, Mom.
Do you think ... yes ...
I think he comes
in two minutes.  
- In principle?
- Yes, in principle.
- Exactly!
- How are you?
Very well, and you
also what I see.
Given the
Capucine the formalities,
because I know you do not like it much.
I have to get out of my
hole of time now,
because for me
never leave the house.
I feel so good there.
But you still appreciates
the bright side of things.
This is your best work.
Its reputation for gourmet ...
to where I go,
restaurant or friends,
if everyone bows before him.
He arranges bottles of wine
special, as if by magic ...
If she knew that
you do not know to fry an egg.
I will relieve such insanity.
Do not worry, Luc, the
meat still has its charms.
I'm more relaxed.
- Hi
- Hi
I did not think that
I will see you again so soon.
- Do you think you see me again?
- I had hope.
My mom works here.
It is a happy coincidence.
Then you grew
in the middle of the books?
Yes And so I do question
not to open any more.
You're funny.
"A good word is worth
more than a bad book. "
Jules Renard. Do not tell me that
you also have this disease?
I fear that yes, my father I

when I was 10. I was given
one of his rare gifts.
So, girl, I angry
all who surround me with ...
quotes, games
Anagrams and other words.

Go the same way.
It gets a little?
Yes, a little.
I am a little old in this picture.
Do not think that sort of thing and
especially not shown to others.
I think I am not so old that way.
 Look, the son of Gaudens.
Poor boy.  
 Poor? It is to make me laugh?  
Ladies, gentlemen,
my compliments.
Miss, my respect.
Unless I am mistaken,
your face does not guide
every day the television?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Excuse me, where can I
find the book a certain ...

They are on the table, near the author.
Near the author! Near the author!
No, please, do you

Yes, but I do not think
he'll care about you.
Say it.

Thank you.
It was his funny little show.
- You like to see?
- Yes
Why do not you like him? Jealousy?
Jealousy, no! Unlike

He is a hypocrite and a con man.
But he is attractive,
rich and famous ...
Rich? No. I'm rich.
Much richer than he is.
I am the son of Gaudens,
Laboratories Gaudens.

"how do you react if I
bring an old man home? "
The Charlotte is 23 years.
I asked “How old is he?”.
She answered "50 years". Well ..

to anyone, that's it. Got it.
Gabrielle ...
Gabrielle, I love you, you know.
It makes it all
efforts to seduce me.
It has no pride.
I do not know ... I do not mind.
I wish both of you please;
or it was a little bit.
Just a little well ...
- I like you.
- Is it true?
She spoke, hallelujah!
She said that love me!

I like to hear it.

My angel ...
Are you aware of
what's happening?
I am an unconscious.
I hurt you ...
Forgive me ...
to protect him ...
and protect it from me.
You are so innocent.
- A little I care now.
- Yes, we care little.
Soon we care,
but I am old.
It is old?
With age comes experience.
- So?
- Said he taught me.
Do not tell me that you are lascivious?
Do not tell me that you are depraved?
Can I stay tonight?
You are prohibited from leaving.
You want me to do a coffee?

 You know, Mommy, it's very funny.  
Either way,
you do not get your appetite.
Not at that time, I devoured.
Does not want a wine
white with your fish?
No.
I saw the program of yesterday

It is more interesting
than the weather.
Anyway, I tell you
almost impressed me.
We must celebrate this ...
Your health!
His, honey, which
you'll be happy.
It is the only thing I care.
I am sure that
will like it very much.
It has no "hum" ... And
you, you'll love it.
I fear that being a
somewhat naive, honey.
And his age that bothers you?
Honestly, it is not a
of positive factors.
He is older than me.
I always thought you
looking for a father, but ...
Anyway, I do not know, I
worry about you.
It's normal.
Does not believe in this relationship, is it?
Set up in my place.
We love.
- And his wife know that?
- Yes, I speak on the subject.
He says it does not
can live without it.
She prefers to accept another
woman to be without him.
He says it is unfortunate,
that is always crying.
The situation should not
be very happy.
- Then, he will never leave it.
- But, yes, he will leave it.
But not now.
He does not want to hurt her.
- And all the honour him.
- Dessert?
Thank you.
Thank you.
The two women more
beautiful in my life.
The most perfect man.

- You two do not exaggerate!
- When my man, my good man.
- Yes
Capucine ... Can It
get the friendly sharks ...
we operate,
permission to ...
the world,
with my princess?
This smells to me
biography ... from whom?
Well, I'm still in doubt ...
Saint Brás or Stevenson,
whatever.
Mr Saint-Denis, what a surprise.
Always well together.
I offer him my wife Dona.
And my friend
Capucine. Paul Gaudens.
Charming.
But you, too, is
very well together.
However, Saint-Denis ...
is my mother and my sisters!
Incidentally, this table where you
is comfortably seated,
is reserved usually for us.
No, do not worry ...
I will not humiliate you and not
ask for change of table, but ...
just wanted to let you know. Just.
 Yes, I know. ladies,
Excuse me, I ... 
 can seem a
little ridiculous, right?  
But is not the first time,
that the sr. Saint-Denis
I step in the callus.
Excuse me this
invasion little educated.
I want a good meal.
This is not part
their admirers.
You have a problem
complex of inferiority.
Does not have much importance.
I love you.
And I'm in love with you.
I am jealous of you two.
- What are you jealous?
- From love.
Without error, without
commitments, without compromises.
It is not difficult, I
live with a saint.
That you said.
You know what the dream of holy
if you have a second life?
Back to live on earth,
but with a man.
- I chose?
- For better and for worse.
- Can you prove it, sir?
- Yes
Thank you.
- Very good.
- Does the wine?
- Thanks!
- Not at all!
- Josephine!
- I did nothing.
- I did something, sir?
- Not at all, miss.
Stop it, not
see that constrain?
Excuse me, sir,
I was the embarrassment.
There's no reason why, miss.
It is divine.
It is as good as the one that
drink in "La Poterie."
- Do not think, Paul?
- Your mother is talking.
Yes, Mommy.
He was saying that this champagne,
is as good as the one that
drink in "La Poterie."
Yes, and that this matter now?
- And why not?
- Because ...
because my answer
is always the same. No.
Well, I ask you for
to reflect again.
Émilienne is charming.
She is very educated and their
Parents are admirable people.
 His father loved them.
They were our friends.  
 And then, I know
Madeleine since childhood.  
But, of course, you are almost raw.
Émilienne, Émilienne, should
call her Cleopatra.
Well, enough.
No, I have other plans.
- We know what?
- Well, I think I'm in love.
What?
He said some stupid?
He hit me in
hands with a ruler,
as the brave Sir Filipo.
- Paul, stop it!
- Remember you Filipo?
You hired me to give
private lessons, I believe?
In this case I had good explanations ...
in areas that you do not
suspected, poor mom.
Anyway, you do not want to know,
stood with his free time ...
to the Committee on Social Works ...
works of social, charity ...
And with those words in your mouth, not
was able to educate their children.
Educate them here ...
but love them there ...
It was a little difficult.
If at least had
some fans, maybe ...
Yes, Paul.
- Frank ...
- Yes
Paul, come with me, I
to get cigarettes in the car.
- See the way it?
- It is a poor wretch.
- Weak ...
- He is seductive.
He is the family of
"Laboratories Gaudens."
At first, the mother brought
the company as dowry,
but the father was a genius in chemistry.
When the father died, the young
Gaudens who were 18,
was involved in an issue
little nasty, with other boys.
Look who speaks ...
No, I speak seriously. They
kidnapped some girls ...
one of them very young, with
9 or 10 years. Very young.
Of course, if the mother
deployed to quell the case.
- How do you know that everything?
- For the people ...
It was my friend Gérard
Briançon, the lawyer.
- Did you know ...
- On the back!
I love you. He
told me and requested secrecy.
Then, the young Gaudens, left
the process clean as the driven snow.
I do not know what to think, dear,
but I do not think very correct.
I am not able to judge
whoever.
 I can open my eyes.  
Not afraid of?
From what?
To feel humiliated.
Not even ridiculous.
I am happy with you.
I love you like 
I've never loved anybody.
Come .  
- Drink something?
- No, I have no desire.
- Okay?
- Not very well, I ...
I'm having difficulty, not
I find the words.
Use the other.
I do not think we did?
Honestly, I do not know ...
Writing bothers me, I do not know
from which it comes, I have to ...
I have to change anything.
Change your wife.
It is even a little girl.
Does not understand.
Not so sure.
Go get dressed, let's go.
Where are we going? It is more than midnight!
Go get dressed, I am saying.
And for a skirt.
I think the mystery.
Mysterious? My ass, yes.
A woman only by the valley
wish she awakens.
- What do you want me to serve?
- A Diabolo of pomegranate.
Ah! this is for girls ...
You were right to throw away
those flowers horrible.
Good night to all.
You know you have a skin of silk?
Happy to review it.
Almost lost the last time.
I could not resist.
- How are you Charles?
- Charles?
In full form. Already
working again.
- It is a time that I do not see it.
- Go ...
Look, speaking in
hell ... he appears.
Capucine ...
I offer you the Gabrielle
of whom have spoken.
Good night e. .. welcome.
But we already saw before us, right?
Yes
Cécile, my dear ... champagne!
- It is beautiful this place.
- And you have not seen anything.
I make him Alban,
the owner of the house.
Good-night!
I think I saw him somewhere.
- It is not the first to tell me that.
- Neither the latter, certainly.
Charles, it is not
just beautiful, she ...
And she does!
Come, my angel.
The friends of our
friends are our friends.  
It is the first time that brings you here?
She his birthday tomorrow.
It is a surprise.
And she knows?
- So it would not be a surprise!
- Think fun?
I think it is fun and excited.
Do not worry about it,
she likes it.
- But, of course, she loves.
- Yeah ...
I also like you
e. .. life is beautiful!
I love this place.
It presents me to your friends?
Finish to drink.
I have something to
to show you. Come on.
Happy birthday, my angel.
Let's go home now?
I will leave you in
home, is the wiser.
- Why wise?
- My angel ...
You know well that travel from tomorrow
morning to London. Had said.
- He had told me next week.
- But no ...
Yes, would be next
week, but ...
Capucine called this afternoon ...
were obliged to change everything,
the last time, because ...
Jonathan Cool had an impediment.
And when back?
Thursday or Friday ...
There are three in the morning, I
wake my mother.
But no ...
If you get very carefully,
as you do very well ...
Bon voyage, my love.
Later, Gabrielle.
My angel.
What is happy without me.
And take care.
Come back soon.
He made so little noise, which
I saw once it had arrived.
- I was asleep?
- Yes, I am sleepwalking.
Happy birthday, my dear.
It was good to have come back home.
He goes from tomorrow
morning to London.
- He once again?
- No, in a 4 or 5 days.
- You are happy. at least?
- Mom, I do not have 12 years.
I do not follow up the
boarding. I know well ...
I hate farewells.
You can take care of it today?
Yes
Do not worry.
It is very strange, it seems that
I am that I am leaving.
I always reply to those who
asks the reason for my trip,
- "I know well because they run away,
- "But not what looking"
I am not less
bet. When are you?
I can not say. Next month ...
Capucine will meet
me in London ...
and it goes fine, I am going to New
York. Depends on Jonathan.
I am not asking anything. I go warning.
I can not live without you.
So I open the door thinking
that is my room ...
and suddenly I see the Woody Allen,
in front of a mirror, looking at it,
almost naked, in
some large underwear,
something beige,
but rather loose ...
- Must have been impressive.
- No. ..
I would not say impressive,
Woody Allen is impressive ...
but Woody Allen of underwear
is the underwear that wins ...
I do not want to say that
Woody is not a genius ...
Sorry, we have to
finish the program ...
But it's funny, if
imagine ... but we can ...
In any case, it was a pleasure ...
... we continue?
to having him here Édouard,
thank you.
Can I stay a little longer?
It's funny, but not
I can. Thank you, Édouard.
I was very happy
to have it received.
The final count on another day?
Yes, with pleasure,
can come at any time. Finalizes
here "A cherry on the cake."
I hope you have enjoyed.
Next week, with
a surprise guest.
But it is not a surprise. It is the Gaade!
I can not say what the surprise.
A good week-end
and even for the week.
Our advertisers, please.
With pleasure!
Thank you, Édouard.
Thank you for coming.
- By any day?
- Yes Success!
- So how was it?
- It was great, Gabrielle ...
Yes, the staff of the
production was happy.
Good. Lisa give me
the phone, please.
- Take.
- Thanks!
 Good morning, you have
a new message.  
 New post.  
 Gabrielle, is Mom,
I would like to ask ... 
It was sensational, my dear.
I ask you, you know
a guy named Pascal Lamanie?
- Yes, yes.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Yes, I know ... but ...
- Call him.
I heard the message of Bernard,
morning, but now I have ...
time to talk about it. I have
an important thing to do.
I'll Call later, if
do not mind.
Sorry. Later, Philippe.
Bitch!
Why did you do that?
It is simply not moving.
Looks like a zombie.
I do not know what to do.
Got any ideas?
No, but can not leave like that.
She went to the doctor?
He said that if it continues like this ...
for another week,
it is internal.
What does she want, in your opinion?
I think she wants to die.
I'm to blame, Denis.
I should have spoken with him.
He is an intelligent man, you know?
I think jealous of her?
The poor mother alone, for 40 years?
What is wrong with you?
What's happening?
It was not you who said that the
feeling of guilt is a poison?
Remember when Mom
was sick?
And then, if he is smart,
will understand the situation.
Certainly not a crapulence.
If it is not a crapulence, must have
reasons to act that way.
Yes, yes. You are right.
He ceased to Gabrielle
anyway.
In any case, there is a
something that I am sure.
- What he loves.
- It is very complicated for me.
I am fortunate to be here.
But this is the charm
of bums, you know?
Sometimes close,
other times, far.
The phone will wake her.
Hallo! Good morning.
No, sorry, she is sleeping.
No, she did not eat anything
this morning. I do not know.
Re-connect, if you like.
Yes, I promise.
Goodbye.
I do not know what to think of this.
- The son of Gaudens.
- Yes
Poor boy, all the
call it 'the son of Gaudens'.
He has a name, the name is Paul.
It is as if it existed only in
function than their parents did.
It is not the case?
You know, my dear sister, life ...
is not easy to be lived
for most people.
But for Paul Gaudens, life is not
difficult, because the father was a genius?
- Are you explain it to me.
- Let's say, some points ...
are very important ...
Yes, it is easier for him.
Anyway, he calls
every day and twice daily.
Yes, he is not afraid to wake up.
- He wants what?
- He says that he loves her.
Who wants to marry her,
who wants to see her, take her away.
He says that can save her.
You just have to remember
the "Sleeping Beauty".
The handsome prince, very rich ...
who arrives ...
gives you a kiss,
and she comes back to life.
Either way, it is better
than stand idly by.
It is true.
Hello, Paul? It is Marie
Deneige, the mother of Gabrielle.
You still want
see Gabrielle?
Yes Tomorrow in the afternoon.
It is the fourth floor. Yes, thanks.
Until tomorrow, Paul. Goodbye.
Is what God wants.

- Yes
There you are, was worried.
You should be happy,
spend your money.
- It was shopping?
- Yes
At least it was
with a better color.
- Pay me a drink?
- Yes
- Want to help?
- Yes, thank you.
- What do you drink?
- The same as you.
- Please, two martinis.
- Yes Red or white?
One red and one white.
- I have.
- Thank you.
For you.
Thank you.
It is in appreciation for
take care of me.
What delicacy!
But Gabrielle ...
does not understand that you are the angel?
- I love you, I want to ...
- Paul, do not start with that.
- It is better we stay friends.
- Oh, yes!
Better for whom?
Say?
A week ago I
I do the clown.
You think I do not know at
who is thinking?
I decided to forget it, I
Give a time, please.
What he has, and I don't have?
I'm here, and he fled as
a miserable ... as a coward.
Look at me when I am
speaking. Gabrielle, look at me!
- Paul, do not yell, please.
- Cry if I want.
Do you think that you are a princess
who can kidding me as a child?
Basically, you are like him.
They make a good pair, you two.
Your behavior disgusted me.
There it is!
- Who is?
- Paul, me, open, please.
What do you want? Boring
to be alone?
What are you doing?
My suitcase.
Leaving me alone?
Stop it, is what you want, right?
Drank? You had to drink
to knock on my door?
- It is more cowardly than he.
- Stop thinking about it!
And you, stop me
tell you what to do.
I get it all, Gabrielle.
Do not think that I am a retard.
Are you single woman who
I wanted some time.
I understand, I am not
man for you, is it!
So, well, the comedy is over.
Over! 'Stop'!
You know, the first time
I saw you in the bookstore ...
I thought ...
We have already noticed that spent almost a year?
I am tired. Tired!
I want you to leave me alone.
Do not leave me, I stay with you.
Yes, and so again,
you disappear again.
You must think I'm an idiot.
Now, I do not
want you anymore, Gabrielle.
I do not want to see it ever again.
And, you know what? Shame on you!
I want to be with you.
If I want, I agree
to marry, but please ...
get outta here.
Repeat what you just said?
If you want, I would like
to get married to you.
No, no ... but we
havn't slept yet together.
Tell that to
I get jealous.
I think it will make me happy.
I am wrong?
Tell me I'm wrong!
But, yes, no ... finally ...
But, my love, if
this is true ...
I will be the man
happiest in the world.
Thank you.
I will call my mother,
I call Mom.
 Hello, Mom?
Yes, I am. Yes  
 She said yes ... yes!  
 - Catherine, good morning!
- Good morning, Nicolas!  
What counts of
our friends "VIP"?  
 Their placement is perfect,
my dear Nicolas, because  
 the purpose of medicines if
announces the publication of banns,  
 tradition is tradition, which precedes
the marriage of Paul Gaundens,  
 wealthy heir of
Laboratories Gaundens  
 of regular and nighclubs,  
 with very attractive
Gabrielle Deneige,  
 found that the channel TVL  
 where did the weather,  
 now, star of his own
program, "A cherry on the cake."  
 Sometimes it's good to have a
fiancé of position.  
 Or a lover ... 
Son of a bitch!
She can not marry this jerk.
 What did you say?  
Speech always when I am
far ... What happens?
I asked if the mail arrived.
Let me see.
Hello, Capucine? It is the Charles.
Uncomfortable?
I wish that uses
his talent for detective.
Like a present, my baby?
My baby?
Like most of gaton?
Paul, please.
I will leave them. I have a meeting,
at ten o'clock, to see the dress.
- I go with you.
- No, no, no way.
Mom, I just want to
go in her cart.
But Paul, I have never seen a groom
watch the test of dress.
- That does not exist.
- I do not want to let her go alone.
You can go with her, if you like.
Do not worry.
My mother will be there.
Mom, of course, you have
other things to do.
Well, and how! No longer
I know where I put my head.
You announced this
marriage too quickly.
The godparents are
in Monte Carlo ...
When you go see the Bishop Goudot?
- Monsignor ... who?
- Paul, explain to her.
Monsignor Goudot is who will
celebrate our wedding.
Finally, we have to see it
for preparation.
- The preparation of?
- My God ...
I think she never
put your feet in a church!
- Mommy!
- I 'm going.
Paul, my dear, please
Remind your mother that
my name is Gabrielle.
"Hi," Hi.
Mom ...
 Paul, my son.  
 You are making the greatest
stupidity of his life.  
 Certainly, it will not be the last.  
How do I look?
How can I say? Else.
Do not take this the wrong way, baby,
but it's hot in here,
I am going out there smoking a cigarette.
But, of course, you can go.
Between.
- What a surprise!
- I. ..

- I was leaving.
It could be kind enough to
leave them alone in an instant?
Yes, of course, had
finished. Not lack anything else.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
As I said to my
Mom, what a surprise!
- Please ...
- How do I look?
You will not marry
with that guy.
The fun of this marriage,
is that bothers many people.
You should see the face of
his mother, she hates me.
We have already noticed that he is
completely unbalanced?
Why? You think you
are a model to follow?
You are a great
son of a bitch, Charles.
A real bastard.
A denial of what you are.
I heard that his real
name is Charles Denis,
and added that
the 'Saint'. It was not?
Let's forget everything,
start from scratch.
Yeah, right, back to the beginning.
To our games, in its
home, between six and eight of the night,
when it is convenient?
And our night between its
friends? As you said ...
"If I had to learn a
truly free spirit "?
That is what we want to start over?
This is how you love me?
Anyway, you
do not love me anymore.
Don't love you anymore?
Listen, my great psychologist.
I never loved another
man like I loved you.
Never again.
Yes, I love you.
Today, I love you, Charles.
But I matured, thanks to you.
"What does not kill me, makes me
stronger, "know who said that?
It may be that when
you're married ...
Yes, it would be more balanced.
You have no shame!
I still laugh, still good.
Do not know represent,
when does the victim.
Listen, it is very simple.
Leave your wife ...
And I swear you
I will not marry with Paul Gaudens
But ... she always
was good to me.
I would like to believe.
Go away, please.
- Do not forget me.

Tell me who did? No, do not say anything.
Do not say anything, I know.
You know, because I already told you.
And you don’t know,
I need to ask.
- Do you hide anything, Paul.
- No, shut up. Shut up, please!

 One time, two, ten times?  
How many men
you got before him?  
 Three, four, a
ten, a hundred?  
237! Stop Paul, you are ridiculous.
Gabrielle, just ask you one thing ...
 to tell me the truth.  
With many friends and girlfriends,
Charles forced to have sex?
You do not understand.
No doubt. I do not
I understand that ...
I can not understand how
treat you like a ...
Come on, say the word with
clarity, since it is not the reality.
The reality!
The reality, the reality ...
seem to be what it takes
for his pleasure ...
You make me sick.
Paul Listen, if I told you, if you
all told, with nothing to hide,
I thought it was because
could trust you.
So you know who
I am entirely.
It has nothing to do with it,
I do not want more

Just everything. It is past.
But, well, I do not
helps to forget.
Yes, if he had
even forgotten ...

My God!
What God is there with this?
- You do not understand.
- So we are even.
Still loves him, yet
thinks of him, don’t you?
I can not bear ...

Do not touch me.
I do not want pity.
Why married me,
My poor Paul?
Why I got married
with you, "my poor Paul?
He was were on your back, my
beautiful, and your ass!
But you see, that despite all

You do not know what I am capable of.
- Are you scared?
- Yes, I fear.
You have fear.
- A good concert.

- Nonetheless, despite this ...
- Do not say it is not pretty.
Anyway, I was
sorry not to have gone.
You have so much that
do, my mother-in-law.
Speaking of Mozart, I've read
The last book of Saint-Denis?
The criticism is very good.
We buy,
but not yet read.

The truth is that he

You know, it is also the
think of my wife.
Anyway, I do not know

 But it is one of the joys of
my job, so ...

 Dear friend, welcome.  
All those I

my speeches are
more formidable in the world.
 At least recognize the quality ... 
You are late, Paul.
I could have made an effort.
Yes, but Gabrielle felt bad.
Would without it.
It is not my way
to be, you know.
I do not understand why.
I assure you that ...
 obliged to applaud the generosity
and the humanism of this woman ... 
Geneviève  Gaundens.  
Thank you.
I have the habit of being
in the center of attention.
I want to thank you for coming
in such great numbers tonight ...
 I. .. is certainly
because of you ... 
 that we can
a few more miracles,  
this year.
I have touched a thought
by all those who
take a bit of heat ...
 and comfort,
in these difficult times.  
 But I would now like to pass
a word to anyone ... 
 we all admire and, better
that I will be able to speak.  
I  Charles Saint-Denis,

And it is no less, I
I am happy to be ...
I, Paul Gaudens ...
kill the beast, kill the beast
that corrupted my wife.
 - She will never accept!
- I give you choice.  
His father, in the past,
defended our interests.
My husband ... had
great esteem for him.
I will not hide, which is the
third lawyer that contract.
The time is now.
The day of reckoning is approaching.
I hope I do not mislead
relying on you.
All I can say,
lady? This case fascinates me.
And I can assure you that I am stubborn
and proud. I do not like to lose.
So I say, not always
often lose.
But be lying,
if not tell you
that what is looking
a reduction of penalty
in the hope of
find, firmly,
a more
in favor of his son.
It was not what
I was thinking.
Your father deserved the affection
that my husband engaged you.
How you proceed?
I need to find
Gabrielle, fast.
Be careful. She
has a profound addiction.
I already know the kind, lady.
I do not get.
I have not talked about their fees.
I was well-educated, madam.
But I am sure that
reach an agreement.
Speaking of money ... your son
had a contract of
marriage to ... his wife?
Separation of property.
It is normal, she has nothing.
Insisted fairly with Paul. By
what? You think she can ...
No, it is worth it
worry. We will see this later.
Where can I find his daughter-in-law?
Since the event,
she spends most
the time in mother's home.
She works in a small bookstore.
Not love
the presence of it here.
But officially, she
live with us, of course.
Now that journalists
forgotten a little bit of us ...
- I authorize ...
- Yes, I call later.
I will investigate the case,
and tell you something.
Do you think we can
avoid the scandal?
I mean ...
Everything depends on who is
smudge, you Gaudens.
Glad to see that
we believe, Doctor.
When you can see my son?
Since the downloaded,
the other lawyers not ...
I have been able to get
a license to visit him.
Let me handle it
tonight, lady.
Sleep well?
I do not sleep.
The lawyer of Gaudens called.
Another lawyer, doctor Lorbach.
He left a number of
phone for you. It is urgent.
I know what they want.
They want me to
witness against Charles.
I tell them ...
What do you tell ...
What not even dared to tell me.
I loved him so much.
- It was not weakness, understand?
- Of course I understand it.
I do not want to defile the memory
it is absurd that I ask.
And his wife ...
Imagine the scandal?
Can not avoid the scandal.
You can count on the Gaudens.
Here, to aerate the ideas.
A letter from his uncle.
He will be here next month.
If at least he could
make it disappear ...
 "BEGINS TO JUDGING THE GAUDENS"
They can write this, Mom?  
We can not ban?
Unfortunately, no
You can do anything.
We have a small
leeway.
If the bonus does not testify ...
- It is late.
- She does not come.
Yes, it comes. On the tone of his
voice, I can assure you that coming.
We have to convince her.
I said, I charge.
What can she say?
Things that I would not like
to have heard, believe me.
She arrived.
 Good morning, madam Gaudens,
to expect in the office.  
Yes, you can enter.
- Good morning!
- Good morning, madam!
Eleonore, Josephine,
let us now.
Thanks for answering so
quickly to my request, my lady ...
Understand that time is short.
Before you speak you Gaudens,
Let me emphasize its
interest in this case.
And, again, I talked to Paul.
He loves you with a love
sincere and devoted.
In his head, was on his
question that he is upset.
But he did not incriminating.
He tries to protect you
for the rest of your life.
The family intends to
be very generous with you.
It is not something which
can overlook.
I will leave you. I am in small
room should they need me.
I hope I can count
with you, Gabrielle.
I am completely desperate.
I believe in its coolness
in relation to my son.
That is why I
offered money?
You're the one that
can save my son.
Every day I curse the destiny ...
by Paul have it known ...
It is a torture to know that luck ...
of my son is in his hands.
But ...
My God, how hard it is ...
One thing you should know
before making a decision.
I had another
son ... before Paul.
Thibaut.
Another boy.
They had ten months of difference.
They were inseparable.
Seemed twins.
One night ...
Paul had three years,
Thibaut almost four ...
We never knew, in
Indeed, what happened.
The Paul was still so small.
They were joking
together in the bathtub.
I was beside my room,
I am preparing for a dinner
Dario on that house.
It was important for a dinner
the business of my husband.
Hear the children laughing.
He had left the
door ajar ...
They laughed.
Thibaut was a little boy
Extraordinary ...
he was already very smart.
And then I stopped listening.
Then, Paul called for me.
He continued to laugh ...
I entered the bathroom ...
Thibaut had to
head under water.
Do you realize what is
went to the head of Paul?
What he would have done?
The weight he had to
support all these years.
He was not in charge ...
He loved his brother.
He was so sweet.
After that ...
After that ... things
never been the same since.
Even after the
birth of girls.
Gabrielle, I know ... you ...
Things are not simple, right?
What will you do, Gabrielle?
I do not know.
Gabrielle!
How are you feeling?
I no longer feel anything.
I am completely
annihilated, empty.
I loved him so much.
I just leave the office
Gérard from Briançon.
He said they want you
witness against Charles.
It is true.
I hope you understand
that is not my habit
interfere in people's lives.
- But I want to know ...
- Are you afraid for you?
My baby.
No, not for me,
nor the reputation of Charles.
Not know how
I wanted to see him.
I'd like to know which side I am?
Stay in your own
First, do not take sides.
Perhaps what
I wanted to tell you.
Do not listen to anybody ...
I think that ...
I want to tell the truth.
"The truth and the whole truth."
It will always be the truth.
It is the only one I know.
I hope they understand.
There is no doubt that the
testimony of Gabrielle Gaudens
brings new light to this case
and explains, if that is not the
justify the gesture of Paul Gaudens.
Nonetheless, these revelations,
a little delicate,
it must be said,
not cease to surprise, coming
a former presenter ...
that was supposed be
white as snow.
 Today verdict of the case Gaudens.  
It is expected
mitigating circumstances.  
As I hoped,
The jury considered the circumstances
Mitigating the Paul Gaudens,
finally sentenced to seven years,
'imprisonment in a
establishing special.
Let's hear the reaction of the
Doctor Stéphane Lorbach
the lawyer of Paul Gaudens,
with the announcement of the verdict.
We fully
satisfied with this verdict.
He responds to double duty
of justice and humanity,
that is our constant
concern.
 Gaudens, yourwife is here.  
I do not want to see her anymore.
You came for your money?
I come from prison,
Paul do not want to see me.
It is one of the freedoms that
he has. It was amazed?
I took testify, the
penalty was mitigated,
is a strange way
I thank of him.
You not only told the truth?
Time to
grow, my little.
Tomorrow will receive
A letter from Paul,  
 with its application for divorce.  
 for the rest, Paul
be under supervision ... 
until further notice.
Believe me, you should not receive
more than a cent from us.
you dispose
I understand.
I apologize, but I am
with the car, I need it.
Denis!
I had difficulty finding it.
You know I travel a lot, informed
all my free time with his mother.
So ... how is
my baby niece?
Not quite well, should know.
Want to visit my castle?
Yes? So, come on.
Thank you!
It is not worth doing this
man, is my niece.
You know I do not think
no, sir Merlaint.
I know, you Bonaire.
Want to drink? A tea?
- I hate tea!
- I have something at home.
Mom said she wanted to see me.
I am always willing to see it.
To tell the truth ...
I have a proposal to ask you.
Dishonest?
Of course!
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 over the number that will follow ... 
I'll observe ...
total silence!
In order to never
disrupt the merger,
essential to its operation.
Actually,
the blade of the saw
gives 6500 turns per minute.
The danger is considerable. Total.
I therefore welcome the courage of my
charming assistant, Gabrielle!
I ask that they receive
with applause. Gabrielle!
