This is how "Evangelion: Death"
was meant to be done.
ANTARCTICA, 2000 A.D.
So, this is Dr. Katsuragi's
Super Solenoid Theory..
This whole thing just
seems so untenable!
It's just a theory..
Well, the S2 "theory" is
the only feasible explanation...
of the source of that
monster's power.
Not to mention that it's already been
proven, even if it was by accident.
We have proof of its existence.
Scientists.
They always think
they have all the answers.
Delusions of grandeur.
They' re so caught up
in their dogma,
they lose their grip on reality.
And yet they're supposed to be...
leading the rest of us
on the quest for truth.
How ironic.
They' re not so noble.
Discovery. Brings joy.
Understanding leads to control.
They' re just trying
to find happiness.

Is that you dad?
15 Years Later...
she was held by a man.
Ritsuko must think
I'm pretty shameful.
Appearing to give into
our sexual desires makes for...
a more realistic appearance.
A good deception.
To deceive the
Intelligence Department?
Or the Commander and Ritsuko?
Or me?
No, no. I meant myself.
Don't you mean the others?
You never show interest in others,
but you want their attention.
You really are just like my dad.
9 Months Earlier...
he was watching the stars.
So, tomorrow I'll be in Japan.
Misato said she'll come to
pick me up at noon.
I guess I won't be
seeing you for a while.
How dull.
Once you get to Japan, I'm sure
you'll have lots of new boyfriends.
In fact, I heard
the 3rd Child is a boy.
I don't care about
any stupid little kids!
My heart belongs to you, Kaji.
7 Years Earlier...
she ran into a room.
Mama! Mama!
They chose me!
I'm an elite pilot now!
I'm the best in the whole world!
I must keep this a secret,
but I'll only tell you, Mama!
Everybody's so nice to me now.
I don't feel lonely anymore!
I'm OK now,
even without my Papa around!
Look at me!
Look at me, Mama!
Look, Mama!
Asuka!
Your sync ration has
dropped an entire 8 points.
Don't think about anything else.
Just concentrate!
I'm trying to!
Asuka's sync ratio is going down.
What does it mean, ma' am?
It means trouble.
Let's concentrate
our efforts on fixing Unit 00.
Good morning, Commander.
Did you bring your child today?
Oh wait, I could have sworn
you had a little boy.
Oh no, this isn't Shinji.
I've decided to take care of
the child of an acquaintance.
Her name is Rei Ayanami.
Hello, Rei.
5 Years Later...
she met him again.
Shinji Ikari
It's no use. This is dumb.
I shouldn't have come here.
Maybe I should find a shelter.
I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away.
Several Months Later...
he was forced
to make a decision.
- Thank you, Shinji!
- Kaoru, but why?
It is my destiny to live forever,
though my survival
will destroy the human race.
However, it is possible
for me to be killed,
and whether I live or die
makes no difference.
Death is the only
absolute freedom.
What? Kaoru!
I don't understand
what you are talking about, Kaoru.
This is my final request.
Please, give me freedom.
Otherwise you will be destroyed.
Only one life form can be chosen
to evade the destruction...
and seize the future.

Hey, come in.
Uh... I don't... want to intrude.
Shinji, this is your home now.
I'm... I'm home.
Welcome home!
Who is she?
The only survivor
of the research team.
She hasn't said a word
in almost two years.
How terrible...
She saw Hell first hand.
Her physical wounds could be healed,
but repairing the psychological
damage could take time.
Her name is Katsuragi...
Misato, you said?
Yup! Misato Katsuragi.
Pleased to meet you!
Dear Mother,
I have just become acquainted
with a girl named Katsuragi.
I understand she is the sole survivor
from the original research team.
She used to be mute,
but now she talks so much.
It seems like she's trying
to make up for lost time!
Do I want to be good?
I have to be a good girl.
Because I have no daddy.
Because I have to be good
and not bother my mommy.
But I don't want to
become like my mom.
When my father is not here,
she always cries.
I can't cry.
I can't depend on anyone else.
Maybe my father
won't hate me if I am good.
But I hate my father.
And I hated being a good girl.
I hate it. I'm tired of it.
Misato used to go out with Kaji.
I don't really like her.
Her life style is a little bit much.
Misato Katsuragi.
She's not a bad person.
So much has happened
since I came here.
Before this,
I lived with my teacher.
It was calm and boring
in those days.
I wasn't really doing anything.
But I was fine with that.
There was really
nothing that I had to do.
I didn't have anything to live for.
Did you hate people?
I didn't really care as much.
However, I really hated my father.
I wonder why Shinji
agreed to pilot again.
It seems that he simply does
what he's told to do.
I suppose that's just
his way of getting through life.
Position target in the center,
pull the switch.
Position target in the center,

Today the fourth Angel
attacked out of the blue.
Unit 01 intercepted the Angel
and destroyed it.
Shinji, wake up!
How long are you
going to avoid school?
Unit 01 is already
completely repaired.
You' re the pilot! Are you
going to leave it sitting there?
Shinji!
"To Misato Katsuragi"
It's been raining
for the past 4 days in a row.
Work on the sample analysis has been
postponed due to the weather.
Other than that,
nothing else to write about.
Well, the sun finally
came out for a while today.
But over all
it was partly cloudy.
Nothing else to write about today.
I like it out here at night,
because those
noisy cicadas don't chirp.
It was pretty quiet when I was a kid,
but there are tons of them now.
Misato said that the ecosystem
was returning to its former state.
Misato said so, hmm?
I really envy you.
You live with
such a beautiful woman,
and you get to pilot the Evangelion.
The Eva is on standby.
Will you pilot it? Or won't you?
You're not going to
scold me for running away?
Of course you're not.
I'm no relation to you, am I.
If I say that I won't pilot Unit 01,
what are you going to do with it?
I suppose that Rei will do it.
You won't pilot it?
It seems a little bit unrealistic
for you to force everything on her.
Don't worry, I'll pilot it.
But you don't want to do it.
Of course not.
It's not something
that comes to me naturally.
Ayanami and you
and Ms. Ritsuko-
Stop it! This has nothing
to do with any of us!
If you don't like it, get out of here!
Just forget all about Eva and us
and go back where you came from.
We don't need someone
with that attitude here!
Of course, if you're leaving,
we'll have to leave this city soon.
But we can't blame you for that.!
We saw how you
suffered in the Eva.
And anyway,
if anyone does try. to blame you,
I'll beat them up!
I'm the one who deserved
to be beat up, not you!
I'm a coward!
I'm dishonest.
I'm sneaky and a wimp.
Shinji,you mustn't run away.
Not from your father,
and not from yourself.
Shinji, are you sure about this?
I don't mind living alone,
I'm alone anyway.
It's awesome!
The buildings are growing!
Of course, if you're leaving,
we'll have to leave this city soon.
But we can't blame you for that.!
We saw how you
suffered in the Eva.
You protected this city.
I forgot to tell you something.
You did something very good
and very noble today.
You should be proud.
Goodnight, Shinji.
Hang in there.
We believe that
mental and physical exhaustion...
were causing a strain
on the 3rd child's health.
He was given 4 days leave.
His status has returned to normal.
No further problems.
I'm... I'm home.
Welcome home!

You're just a kid yourself!
Hello, Misato!
How have you been?
Just fine.
Goodness, you've grown!
Uh huh!
And my figure's filled out, as well.
Let me introduce you!
This is the designated pilot
of Eva Unit 02, the 2nd child.
Asuka Langley Souryu.
She's arrogant...
egotistical...
conceited...
freaky...
self absorbed...
twisted...
cold hearted...
schizophrenic...
saccharine...
unsympathetic...
self centered...
totally absurd...
and just plain annoying!
Are you afraid of other people?
I know that
by keeping others at a distance,
you avoid a betrayal of your trust.
But you must endure the loneliness.
Man can never
completely erase this sadness,
because all men
are fundamentally alone.
Pain is something that
man must carry. in his heart,
and since the heart feels pain
so easily, some believe life is pain.
What do you think about
Shinji Ikari?
The Great Third Child?
He's boring.
And yet his synchronization ratio
was well over 40% in combat.
Sync ratio zero.
Hey, Third Child!
I can't be
the Second Child anymore.
You're coming with me.
Unit 02 is red.
I didn't know that.
Units 00 and 01 were the
prototype and test type models.
The fact that Unit 01 synchronized
with an untrained pilot like you...
is proof of that.
However, Unit 02 is a little different.
It's been built for combat.
My Unit 02 is the
world's first real Evangelion!

Why so gloomy?
You should appreciate that
I'm saying good morning to you!
The other one's here too, right?
Who?
Are you stupid?
I'm talking about
the First Child, of course!
Oh! Ayanami!
Hello! You must be Rei Ayanami,
the pilot of the Prototype.
I'm Asuka.
Asuka Langley Souryu.
I'm the pilot of Eva Unit 02.
Let's be friends!
Why?
Because it would be convenient!
If I'm ordered to,
I will do it.
Weird girl...
How are their
coordination drills going?
As you can see...
I knew it!
I could never sink down to his level!
The whole idea's impossible!
- Rei?
- Yes?
Why don't you try it?
I have no reason left to live.
Nobody cares about me anymore.
I am not a doll.
Synchrograph minus 12.8.
It's barely over
the starting indicator.
That's pathetic!
That's a worse score than yesterday!
Asuka's not feeling well today.
It's the second day of her period.
Sync ratios aren't influenced
by physical changes.
The problem is deep
within her sub-conscious.
Asuka's pride
has been badly damaged.
It's hard to blame her
after she was defeated so badly.
What's worse is that she feels
as if she was beaten by Shinji.
If you don't open your mind to her,
your Eva will not move.
I'm closing my mind to it?
Yes. Eva has its own mind.
It's a big doll.
You don't know?
You're giving me advice?
Maybe tomorrow it will snow!
Are you happy that I'm having
trouble with my Eva now?
When the next Angel comes,
our invincible Shinji
will ride out and destroy it!
We won't have to do anything!
I thought it was bad
when Shinji was nice,
but when an emotionless mechanical
doll like you starts being sympathetic,
I'm doomed!
I am not a doll.
Shut up! You do anything
you're ordered to, don't you!
You'd kill yourself if Commander Ikari
told you to, wouldn't you?!
Of course.
Good morning.

Hey! Big shot!
What are you staring at so intently?
Nothing!
Could it be... Ayanami?
No!
Looks pretty obvious to me!
Ayanami's breasts!
Ayanami's thighs!
Ayanami's calves!
It's nothing like that!
Then what were you looking at?
You can't fool us, Shinji!
I was just wondering
why she's always alone.
Come to think of it,
she hasn't had any friends...
since she started here
in the Seventh grade.
You two are both Eva pilots, right?
You ought to know her
better than any of us, Shinji.
Yeah, that's right!
But we don't speak to each other.
She's a nice girl,
but she's like your father.
She's not very. adept.
Not adept at what?
Living.
Excuse me...
Excuse me! It's me, Ikari.
Ayanami, I'm coming in.
Are these Ayanami's?
Um... I...
Oh no! I-I didn't mean-!
Please get off.
What is it?
Uh, well, I was asked to...
Uh, well, I was asked to...
you know, so I...
What was it? The card!
Your card! It's been, uh, renewed.
So I was asked to deliver it.
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.
Aren't you afraid
of piloting Unit 00?
Why?
I heard that you were hurt
pretty bad in an earlier experiment.
I was just wondering
if you were nervous.
Aren't you Commander Ikari's son?
Don't you have faith
in your father's work?
Of course not!
How could I ever trust him?
Ayanami...
Pilot Ikari,
I've been sent here to brief you...
on the Operation
Yoshima time tables.
Pilots Ikari and Ayanami
will arrive at the Cage by 17:30.
At 18:00, Unit 00
and Unit 01 will activate.
At 18:05, both Units

They will arrive at the temporary

There they will await further orders.
The operation will begin

I don't feel like eating anything.
We will be departing in 60 minutes.
Do I really have to pilot Eva again?
Yes, you do.
I don't want to.
I don't want to go through it again!
Then you can just stay here in bed.
What do you mean?
I will pilot Eva Unit 01.

You're very. strong, Rei.
I have nothing else.

Ayanami! Are you alright?!

Don't say that you have

Just don't say that!
And don't say goodbye
like that when you leave.
It's just too sad...
Why are you crying?
I'm very sorry.
I don't know how
I should act at a time like this.
Maybe you should just try smiling.
Ayanami...
It's not a problem. I can go.
If I die, I can be replaced.
Are you trying

Rei!

- A dream?
- Yes,you do dream, don't you?

Rei Ayanami. Age 14.

What are you doing, Asuka?
What's wrong with Unit 02?!
Her sync ratio is under 10%!
- Asuka!
- It won't move.
I will go in Unit 02.
This is pain.
Pain? No, it's different.
Loneliness.
Yes, this is loneliness.
Am I the one crying?
Rei!
I want Evangelion Unit 01
taken out of cryostasis.
Launch it immediately.
- What?
- Do it!
Yes sir.
You didn't do that for me.
Spread your AT Field to full.
Get Rei out of there now!
Right.
It smells like Ikari.
Ikari!
Is this my mind?
To become one with Ikari?
No!
Her AT field's been reversed!
I cannot. If I leave Unit 00,
the AT field will cease to be.
I will not let it.
Rei, are you trying to kill yourself?
12 Years Earlier...
The same weather day after day.
Somehow the
disappearance of autumn...
makes this country
seem more melancholy.
If the scenario described in SEELE's
secret Dead Sea Scrolls in correct,
then the Third Impact will occur
in a little over ten years from now.
That's why they created
SEELE and Gehirn-
to stop that from happening.
I know your intentions are good,
but not SEELE's.
Professor Fuyutsuki,
opening the seal in this world
would be catastrophic.
Ikari is in charge of the project now,
but it takes more than one person
to accomplish something like that.
What happened last time
must never be repeated.
I've been sent a warning.
It seems those bastards would have
no qualms over making me vanish.
You or any of the other survivors.
It's so easy to erase someone.
That's why you shouldn't
become the next test subject.
Everything has its place
in the flow of life.
That's why I'm a member of SEELE.
For Shinji's sake.
It's been three years
since we were last here.
That's when I ran away.
I haven't come
back here since then.
I just don't believe that
my mom is really resting here.
I don't even remember her face.
Burying memories
is man's way of surviving.
But there are some things
a man should never forget.
Yui taught me that.
I come here to confirm that.
You don't have a picture of her.
No photographs. Nothing remains.
Even this grave is an artifice.
That's like my teacher said.
You threw everything away.
Everything is kept in my heart.
That's good enough for me.
5 Years Earlier...
The night before she died,
my mother told me that the MAGI
were the three aspects of her life:
herself as a scientist, herself as
a mother, and herself as a woman.
Those three aspects of her...
are struggling for dominance
inside the MAGI.
She intentionally implanted
the dilemmas that humans have.
You've always been so cool
and analytical about these things.
Aren't you afraid
you'll lose your chance at happiness?
First, I have to define happiness.
It's been a while since I went out.
- Have a good night.
- See you later.
What are you doing here, Rei?
I got lost.
Do you want to come with me then?
No, thanks.
But how will you
get back all by yourself?
That's not your business, old hag.
What?
I can find my way home
by myself, old hag.
You shouldn't call someone
an "old hag", Rei.
But you are an old hag, aren't you?
I'm getting mad. Commander Ikari
will scold you for this.
The Commander is the one
who calls you that.
He says, "That old hag is annoying.
That old hag is no use anymore. "
That old hag is annoying.
That old hag is no use anymore.
That old hag is no use.
That old hag is no use.
The Commander
says that about you.
You!
Eva has reactivated!
Amazing.
This is impossible.
It must be wrong!
Unit 01's sync ratio is over 400%?!
She's reawakening.
It's eating... the Angel.
The S2 engine...
she's taking it into herself!.
The bindings!
What bindings?
Those plates weren't just armor,
they were also restraints.
Those bindings
allowed us to control it,
but now the Eva is removing
the web that binds it to our will.
The Eva is free at last!
Unit 01's been
awakened and set free.
SEELE sure won't stay
quiet for this!
Was this part of your scenario,
Commander Ikari?
It has begun.
Indeed. This is the beginning!
I'm still alive.
Paging Dr. Odani
in the First Internal Department.
Ayanami!
I'm so glad you're safe.
My father isn't coming.
Thank you.
Thank you for saving my life.
For doing what?
Ayanami, didn't you
sacrifice Unit 00 to save me?
Oh. Did I save you?
Don't you remember?
I don't know.
I think I must be the third one.
Rei Ayanami!
It can't be!
You mean the dummy plugs are-?
Yes. These are the
cores of the dummy plugs.
It's the production lab.
These...?
These? These are empty vessels.
Nothing but spare parts. Spare Reis.
Mankind found a God,
and man in his folly
tried to make the god his toy.
For that arrogance,
mankind was punished.
That happened 15 years ago.
And the God
that man found was lost.
But man continues
to attempt to resurrect the God.
And from that God, Adam,
man attempted to make
a man who was like a God himself.
And that was Eva.
What? Eva's are human?!
Yes. Inside the empty shell
of each Eva is a human soul.
But the only vessel
which can hold a soul is Rei.
She was the only one
who could hold a soul.
These things are empty husks.
They have no souls.
No right to live.
The Chamber of Guf is empty.
You! Do you have any idea
what you're doing?!
Yes, I do.
I'm destroying these THINGS
with human forms!
You're late!

It seems like you're
always with my father.
Commander Fuyutsuki
is the one who's always with him.
Have you been asking
around about your father?
I just haven't been
around him much.
So,you really don't know him.
But I've learned
a lot about him lately.
I've learned how he feels
about his work... about my mother...
No,you're wrong Shinji.
You only think you understand,
but people can't even
really understand themselves,
much less each other.
Understanding 100%
of anything is impossible.
That's why we spend
so much time trying to understand...
our own motivations and those of others.
That's what makes life so interesting.
So you can't
understand Misato, either.
The Kanji that we use for the word
"she" means "a woman far away",
and women will always
seem to be on a distant shore.
The gulf that separates male
and female is deeper than any ocean.
What were you doing in Kyoto?
That's a souvenir from Matsushiro.
Don't try to fool me.
You'll get your fingers burned
if you get too involved in this.
That's the advice of a friend.
I'd rather be burned
by the heat of my passion for you.
Well, should I buy you
some fireworks, then?
Hello.
Kaji, do you think I've changed?
You're even prettier.
I'm tired of being pretty.
I'm tired of keeping myself clean.
I'm tired of pretending to be
pure and noble. So tired of it all.
I want to disgrace myself.
I want to see my life
and my reputation ruined.
Like men and women.
Katsuragi, it's me.
I'm sure you're
listening to this message,
especially after
I caused so much trouble.
Sorry..
Please tell Ritsu I'm sorry, too.
And there's one more thing
to trouble you with-
I've been growing melons.
I'd appreciate it
if you could water them for me.
Shinji knows where they are.
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.
Don't hesitate. Move ahead.
If I can see you again,
I will say the words
I could not eight years ago.
Bye.
You fool.
You were always such a fool.
You're a little late, aren't you?
Stop saying such moronic things,
you irresponsible jerk!
Why won't you listen to me?!
Kaji is gone!
Liar.
The song is good.
Singing brings joy
and revitalizes the human soul.
I think that song is the highest
achievement of the Lilin culture.
Don't you agree, Shinji Ikari?
- How do you know my name?
- Everyone knows your name.
You're rather
ignorant of your own status.
Really? Who are you?
I am Kaoru. Kaoru Nagisa.
I am like you.
I am one of the selected children.
The Fifth Child.
You're the Fifth Child?
Um, Mr. Nagisa...
Call me Kaoru, Mr. Ikari.
Mr. Ikari?
You can call me Shinji.
It is time!
Let us go, Adam's dark shadow,
servant of the Lillin!
Eva Unit 02 just activated!
That's impossible.
Where's Asuka?!
She's in Room 303!
I've confirmed it!
Who the hell is piloting it?!
It's unmanned!
The entry plug hasn't been inserted!
Unmanned?
Then the Fifth Child isn't there?
- AT Field detected in Central Dogma!
- Eva 02?
No! The pattern is blue!
It's definitely an Angel!
What?!
That boy is an Angel.
The target has passed
through the 4th defensive layer,
and is still descending!
It's no good! We can't cut
the power to the linear motor car!
The target has passed
through the 4th defensive layer!
Seal all shutters and bulkheads
surrounding Central Dogma!
We've got to
buy ourselves some more time!
Closing all bulkheads immediately.
All personnel evacuate.
All personnel evacuate.
SEELE has sent an Angel to us.
The Old Man wants to advance
his schedule, using us as his tools.
Those who forget the past
are doomed to repeat it.
Unless man accepts and atones
for his sins, he will never evolve.
We won't rely on
Adam and the Angels.
We must take the fate of the future
into our own hands.
Unit 01 will be our instrument.
Unit 02 has penetrated
the armored shutters!
Target has penetrated
the second barrier, sir!
- Send Unit 01 in to pursue it.
- Yes sir.
Under all circumstances
the last Angel must be kept...
from entering Terminal Dogma.
But why did the Angel take Unit 02?
You don't think it's going to attempt
to fuse with Unit 02, do you?
Or will it try to
bring about our total destruction.
It's a lie!
I won't believe that
Kaoru's an Angel! It's a lie!
It's a fact, Shinji. You must stop him.
Prepare for combat.
Shinji, you are late.
Eva Unit 01
descending via Route 2.
It's about to intercept the target.
You betrayed me. You betrayed
the trust I placed in you.
You betrayed me
just like my father did!
Unit 01 has
reached the fourth layer!
It's about to confront the target!
There he is!
I've been waiting, Shinji.
Kaoru!
Asuka, I'm sorry.
The Eva series
was born from Adam.
And yet the Lilin will
utilize that...
which they hate most of all
in order to survive.
I do not understand.
Kaoru! Stop! Why?!
Your Evas and I are
composed of the same matter.
Born from Adam,
I can synchronize with it easily...
as long as
there is no dominant soul,
and Unit 02's soul is
now hiding itself.
An AT Field?
Yes. At least that is what
you Lilin call this thing.
This is the light of my soul,
a sacred territory
in which no one may intrude.
Aren't you Lilin aware
that your AT Field...
is merely that wall
that encloses one's mind?
I don't understand what
you're talking about! Kaoru!
Both Evas have penetrated all the
way down to the final layer!
20 seconds until the target
intercepts Terminal Dogma.
If Unit 01's signal
cuts off or disappears-
I know.
I'll initiate the self-destruct.
It's better than letting
Third Impact take place.
I'm sorry.
It's alright.
As long as I die beside you.
Thank you.
This is mankind's fate.
Human hope is paired with sorrow.
What was that?
It's another AT Field!
The strongest we've ever detected!
It's shutting out everything!
Light, magnetism,
sub-atomic particles!
It's blocking everything out?!
It can't sense anything!
The target, Unit 01,
Unit 02, they're all gone!
We lost communication
with the pilot!
Kaoru!
Wait!
Final safety penetrated!
They've reached it.
Heaven's door is open.
Then the Angel has
finally reached its goal.
Get ready.
What's that?!
- What's going on?
- It's another AT Field!
A field as strong as the first one has
appeared around Terminal Dogma.
It's breaking through
the other AT Field!
What is it?
Another Angel?
Negative!
I can't confirm it.
It just disappeared!
Disappeared? The Angel?!
Adam.
That from which we came.
Must one who was born
from Adam return to Adam,
even though it will destroy man?
Wait, this isn't... Lilith?!
I see! I understand now!
Thank you, Shinji. I wanted you
to take Unit 02 from me.
Otherwise, I might have
lived much longer.
Kaoru... but why?
It is my destiny to live forever,
though my survival
will destroy the human race.
However, it is possible
for me to be killed,
and whether I live or die
makes no difference.
Death is the
only absolute freedom.
What are you? Kaoru.
I don't understand what
you're talking about, Kaoru.
This is my final request.
Please, give me freedom.
Otherwise you will be destroyed.
Only one life form can be chosen
to evade the destruction...
and seize the future.
And you are not
the existence which should die.
You need the future.
Thank you, Shinji.
I am happy I met you.
THE STORY CONTINUES...
Sections 2 and 3 of the East Wing
will close at 1800 hours.
All staff must vacate the area
by 16:30.
Misato and Ayanami scare me.
Help me.
Help me, Asuka.
Hey, wake up. Hey...
wake up!
Hey, hey...
Asuka... Asuka...
Asuka!
Help me.
Please help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me!
Call me an idiot like you always do!
Hey!
I'm so fucked up.
All access to and from
Headquarters has been restricted?
We're on First Level Alert.
That doesn't make sense.
I thought Kaoru was the last Angel.
He was.
All the Angels have been defeated.
If we're all safe,
what are we doing on First Level Alert?
What's going to happen to
NERV and the Evas?
I wish Dr. Akagi was here.
NERV will probably be disbanded.
I don't know
what they're going to do with us.
All we can do is wait for the
Instrumentality Project to commence.
So mankind, a race of flawed
and incomplete separate entities,
has reached the end
of its evolutionary potential.
The Instrumentality Project
will manufacture the evolution...
of man's separate entities
into a single consummate being.
And the Committee won't use
NERV or Adam.
They'll use the Evas.
Just like Kaji said they would.
The time is at hand.
Without the Lance of Longinus,
we cannot use Lilith
to complete the Project.
Our only hope is to proceed
using Lilith's only true offspring,
Eva Unit 01.
That was not part of
SEELE's original plan.
Creating the Evangelion was
the pinnacle of mankind's existence.
Humanity must evolve and
shape this brave new world.
That was why we created
the Eva Series.
We need not cast aside
our human form...
to use Evangelion
as our own private Ark.
It's merely part of the process
to free us all for rebirth.
The fate of destruction
is also the joy of rebirth.
Through the sacrament
of death, God, and humanity,
all living beings will be united
and reborn as one.
Death creates nothing.
You deserve death.
Mankind exists because
it has the will to live.
That is the will of she
who chose to remain in the Eva.
So, that's what really happened
during Second Impact.
They're on to me!
No, wait, something else-
It's begun.
We are under attack.
Transfer the left to the emergency
communications systems!
Use satellite feed if you have to!
Correct.
What's the right side status?
Negative. All outgoing network lines
are being systematically cut off!.
They're going after the MAGI.
Data up load from
external terminals.
They're trying to hack
into the MAGI, sir!
Just as I thought.
Is it coming from the
MAGI 2 in Matsushiro?
No, there are five MAGI systems
working together.
So far I've identifiied the MAGI
from Germany, China, and the U.S.
SEELE is pooling all its resources.
Five MAGI against one.
Not good odds.
The fourth firewall
has been breached!
Locking the main database...
Negative!
The system is being overtaken!
They've breached the next level!
The back up system is inoperative!
This is bad.
If they capture the MAGI, they'll be
able to occupy headquarters.
Let me guess.
They need help with the
MAGI's self-defense system.
Yes. Report to the
Second Command Center...
where you will be briefed
by Lt. Ibuki.
He expects the woman
he abandoned to jump when he calls.
Arrogant bastard.
A Level 2 Alert is in effect.
Status report.
Good morning. Tokyo 2
launched Special Order A-801.
801?
NERV's legal protection and
jurisdiction have been rescinded...
and command has been transferred
to the Japanese Government.
That was the only warning.
They tried to take the MAGI,
but we've managed to
contain the damage so far.
Ibuki here.
Dr. Akagi is currently installing
additional defense programs.
Ritsuko?!
Am I doing something stupid?
The interaction between
men and women is so illogical.
Isn't that right...
Mother?
Goura Ground circuit recovery 0.2%.
How much longer?
We should make it.
Dr. Akagi is amazing!
Just hacking into the MAGI?
Yeah, right.
I doubt they're going
to let us off that easily.
The MAGI was just foreplay.
They plan to launch an all-out
offensive against Headquarters...
and take the two Evas by force,
don't they.
Of course.
We have both Adam and Lilith.
No wonder the old men
are so nervous.
External feed to the MAGI
has been halted.
A Danang B-Type
Defense program is in place.
External access has been
cut off for the next 62 hours.
Mother.
I'll see you soon.
Ikari has installed a Type 666 firewall
on the MAGI's external feed circuits.
That's very difficult to breach.
Apparently we will have to forgo
acquisition of the Tokyo-3 MAGI.
I had hoped to settle this peacefully.
Launch the invasion forces
immediately!
All units move out as planned.
We have lost the radar feed
from sectors 8-17!
A large detachment of
Special Force Units...
has invaded the outer
defense perimeter!
Two more are approaching
from the Gotenba sector!
After all we've been through,
our fiinal enemy is our fellow man.
All personnel go to
Level One battle stations.
Battle stations?!
But they're human, not Angels!
I wish they felt the same way.
What's happening?!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Transmission from the
southern hub has been-
The Daigatake tunnel
has been cut off!.
Fire in the West No. 5 entrance!
Hostile forces have entered Level 1!
The west side attack is a decoy!
If they're really after the Evas,
they'll go after the pilots first.
- Tell Shinji to stand by in Unit 01.
- Roger!
- Where's Asuka?
- Still in recovery room 303.
Get her into Unit 02!
There's no way she can
synchronize with Unit 02!
If they find her,
they're going to kill her.
If we put her in Unit 02,
at least she'll be safe.
Understood!
As soon as Asuka's in there,
hide Unit 02 at the bottom of the lake.
It's not the best hiding place,
but it's better than the cage.
- Where's Rei?
- Unable to locate!
Pilot of Unit 00 is missing!
She will be killed.
Find her, now!
Launching Unit 02
via gate number 8.
The Eva will remain underwater
at a depth of 70 meters.
Prepare to deploy Unit 01.
Station it in the Geofront.
We can't!
Shinji isn't there!
Oh dear god...
Full lock down has been instigated,
starting at Level 2.
All non-combat personnel must evacuate
via route 87 immediately. I repeat...
The No. 3 underground barricade
has been destroyed!
Enemy forces have begun
invading Level 2!
There's nothing we can do
to hold them off.
Our defeat has become inevitable.
Professor Fuyutsuki,
please see to the rest of this for me.
Yes, Commander.
Give my regards to Yui.
No response from Level 2!
Contact has been lost
with control room 77.
Internal monorail track 57
has been destroyed.
This is brutal!
I'd rather be fighting the Angels!
Of course. We're not used
to fighting human enemies.
Sever the red ones first.
Level 3 Block B has been invaded!
There's no stopping them!
Enemy presence confirmed
in Block F!
The Main bypass is under fire!
Seal off levels 1-3!
Order a full retreat!
Release Bakelite through all
passages up through section 803!
Right!
Commencing Bakelite release
in section 703,
thirty seconds to completion.
Commencing Bakelite release
in section 737...
Well, that should buy us some time.
Major Katsuragi!
Route 47 is completely blocked.
The third Unit is unable to advance.
Shinji is cut off!.
All non-combat personnel
should avoid engaging the enemy.
These guys are pros,
so if you can't retreat
to Central Dogma...
you're better off just surrendering.
- Take charge of things here for me.
- Right.
Mt. Futagoyama has been secured.
This is harder than we thought.
We never get the easy jobs.
This is insane! The center wasn't
made to withstand invading armies.
We can barely hold off terrorists.
If the JSSDF launches a
full scale attack, we're screwed.
Slowly but surely they've been
cutting our defense budget.
They've probably been planning this
since the very beginning.
Very possible...
Release the safety.
I can't.
I just can't shoot this thing.
Of course you can!
You've had basic training!
But I shot at targets,
not at other human beings!
Idiot!
It's kill or be killed!
Rei.
I knew I'd find you here.
The time has come.
Let's go.
Level 1 has been secured. Over.
Roger that. We are moving in on the
MAG and the Level 2 Command Center.
We are currently
engaged in combat.
Commence cooling of the Fifth
Malbolgia sector immediately.
Terminate Eva Pilots on sight.
Execution of non-combat personnel
has been authorized.
Yanagihara and Shinjo units,
proceed to lower level.
We've located the Third Child.
Commencing termination.
Sorry, kid. Nothing personal.
Nothing personal here either.
Let's get you to Unit 01.
Come on.
Roger that.
We have the purple unit surrounded.
The Bakelite infusion
was not a problem.
Damn. They're trying to prevent
contact between Shinji and Unit 01.
We're running out of time.
This is it, Shinji.
Do you want to run away
or do you want to pilot the Eva?
If you sit there and do nothing,
then you're already dead!
Help me, Asuka... help me.
Hiding behind the skirts of
a little girl at a time like this?!
Giving up half way is worse
than never trying at all!
Get up.
Move it!
I want to die.
I don't want to do anything.
Stop talking like
a stubborn little brat!
Like it or not, you're still alive!
Get moving and DO something!
You can die later.
Unimportant!
Securing Terminal Dogma is
your top priority, understand?!
They've destroyed everything else,
why don't they just nuke us
and get it over with?!
If we weren't sitting on top of
the original MAGI system,
they probably would have.
They probably need it
in as intact as they can get it.
I just hope they don't use
BC weapons.
Things could get pretty ugly.
That or N2 mines
Speak of the devil...
They aren't holding anything back!
They're over doing it.
Why do they want
the Eva this badly?!
They plan to initiate Third Impact...
using the Eva series
instead of the Angels.
15 years ago, Second Impact was
intentionally engineered by mankind,
because it was the only way
to minimize the potential damage.
They had to reduce Adam
to an embryonic state...
before the other Angels awoke.
You see, Shinji, mankind was
spawned from a being called Lilith,
just like Adam was.
We are the 18th Angel.
The other Angels are just
different possibilities of...
what we could have become.
Sadly, we can't coexist,
even though we are fundamentally
the same creatures.
Listen, Shinji. You have to destroy
the rest of the Eva Series.
It's the only way to stay alive.
The phone lines are all dead.
Nagano Prefecture, Neo Tokyo 2
Yes, sir. Missile impact
was confirmed three minutes ago.
This Instrumentality Project
NERV was secretly researching...
trying to initiate Third Impact
and destroy all of mankind.
The whole thing makes me sick.
Humanity is probably
the only creature...
capable of hating its own kind.
Well, then. I suppose all we have left
to do is destroy NERV Headquarters.
Should Germany or China
begin re-development?
No. We won't make
the same mistake twice.
Make sure no one can touch it
for the next 20 years, like Old Tokyo.
Surface heat has dissipated.
High pressure steam discharges
have also stopped.
All detachments' positions
have been confirmed.
Dogma Level 3 and the
purple unit are currently secured.
And the red one?
In the lake,
about 70 meters down.
We don't know
if the pilot is alive or dead.
I'm still alive...?
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
You're still alive...
You mustn't die yet...
You must live...
I won't let you die...
I will protect you...
You're still alive...
I won't let you die...
You mustn't die...
Please die with me!
Don't kill her...
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
You must live...
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!
Mama!
You've been here all along?
Mama!
- What is that?!
- Dear God!
Mamma... Mama!
Now I understand!
The meaning of the AT Field!
You were always protecting me!
Always watching over me!
We were always together!
Mama!
Eva Unit 02 has activated!
Asuka is OK! She's alive!
Asuka?!
The cable!
Focus your fire power on that cable!
Even without my umbilical cable,
I've still got 12 thousand plates
of fortified armor!
And I've got my AT Field!
There's no way I can lose!
Not to you bastards!
That loathsome Evangelion.
Once again,
our plans will go unrealized.
It seems we'll have to
fight fire with fire.
The Eva Series?
It's been completed?
