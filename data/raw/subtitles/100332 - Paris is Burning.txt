I am Pepper Labeija,

of the house of Labeija.
Not the founder...

I... I just rule it now...
With a soft glove.
And it's important
to me to be the mother,
'cause there's so many little
kids that I have to look out for.
Although they
don't listen to me,
and they buck my authority,
I still think
I rule it pretty well.
They like me.

Gay people... men...
and decide to have a
competition amongst themselves.
Balls.
I went to a ball.
I got a trophy.
And now everybody
wants to know me.
This movie is about
the ball circuit
and the gay people
that's involved in it
and how each person's life
brought them to this circuit.
It's like crossing into the
looking glass in wonderland.
You go in there, and you feel...
you feel 100% right...
as... of being gay.
And that's not what
it's like in the world.
That's not what it's like
in the world.
That's not what it's like

You know, it should be
like that in the world.
This society, going to
a football game, basketball...
that's their entertainment.
You know, a ball is ours.
We prepare for a ball.
We may spend more time
preparing for a ball
than anybody would spend
preparing for anything else.
You know,
a ball is like our world.
The balls, to us,
is as close to reality
as we're gonna get
to all of that fame and fortune
and stardom and spotlights.
Man: I'd always see the way
that rich people lived.
And I'd feel it more,
you know...
it would slap me in the face.
I'd say,
"I'd have to have that."
Because I never felt
comfortable being poor.
Or even middle class
doesn't suit me.
Seeing the riches,
seeing the way people
on "dynasty" lived...
And I would think,
"these people have 42 rooms
in their house.
Oh, my God.
What kind of a house is that?"
And we've got three.
So why is it that
they can have it and I didn't?
I always felt cheated
out of things like that.
Emcee: You have space to do
all that you intend to.
Now, the categories are...

And for the girls,
18 through 30.
As far as
all of y'all not walking,
please realize that we all...
at one time or another...
have lusted to walk

So give the patrons
and the contestants, you know,
a round of applause for nerve.
'Cause with y'all

Believe me.
We're not going to be shady,
just fierce.
Those balls are more or less
like our fantasy
of being a superstar.
You know, like the oscars
or whatever.
Or being on a runway
as a model.
You know, a lot of those kids
that are in the balls,
they don't have two of nothing.
Some of them don't even eat.
They come to balls starving.
And they sleep
in the under-21,
or they sleep on the pier
or wherever.
They don't have
a home to go to.
But they'll go out,
and they'll steal something
and get dressed up and come
to a ball for that one night
and live the fantasy.

Pendavis: I guess I like
the excitement.
You know, it's them cheering
and screaming if you were good.
And that's what got me,
'cause I like the competition.
Makes me stronger.
It makes me think more.
Makes me want to come back
and get them.
It's not just the winning.
It's... it's the giving, too.
'Cause I feel that I give
a lot of enjoyment
to a lot of people
that go to balls.
And they enjoy to see it,
and I enjoy to walk for them.
So that's my... Philosophy,
as I should say.

And we done had our... we have
our status in the ballroom.
How long did it take you

'Cause if I don't go
to a ball with him and iron,
I mean, he'll be here wrinkled.
Or he'd be there ironing.
But, you know,
it helps out when somebody else
is there in your corner,
at your side,
to say, "yeah, you can do it."
"You're gonna be fine.
Just go out there and do
what you usually do."

If everybody went to balls
and did less drugs,
it'd be a fun world,
wouldn't it?
I'm dressing, of course,
to go do a show.
Because I've always
done this professionally.
And I was a dancer.
And I'm trying to remember
when the first time I went to
a ball.
That was the early-type ball,
when everybody just walked,
and they gave away,
like, four or five prizes
in a very limited category.
And the children now...
most of them...
75% of the children
you see at the ball
wouldn't know what a ball was
if it knocked them in the head.
Labeija: When I first started
going to balls,
it was all about drag queens,
and they were interested
in looking like
Las Vegas show girls...
backpieces, tailpieces,
feathers, beads, and all that.
But as the '70s rolled around,
the thing started changing.
It started coming down
to just wanting to look like
a gorgeous movie star,
like Marilyn Monroe,
Elizabeth Taylor.
And now they've went from that
to trying to look like models
like Iman and Christie Brinkley
and maud Adams
and all those children.
Corey: Everyone couldn't be
a Las Vegas show girl.
Everyone couldn't put on
a stack of feathers
and a big headpiece.
So they made the categories
where everybody...
that's what really made
the balls change.
So there was more involvement.
Everyone that goes to one of
these affairs now
damn near participates.
Eventually, over the course
of a year's balls,
they've all walked the runway
in some category or another.
Either you've got a nice body
or you are very fashionable
or you're very pretty
or you're very real-looking.
But there's always something
there for everyone.
And it's like...
it's like in nature...
I'm such a nature fan...
the young ones are always
bucking to move the...
the old bulls out of the way.

Corey: In real life, you can't
get a job as an executive
unless you have
the educational background
and the opportunity.
Now, the fact that
you are not an executive
is merely because of
the social standing of life.
That is just pure thing.
Black people have a hard time
getting anywhere.
And those that do
are usually straight.
In a ballroom, you can be
anything you want.
but you're looking like
an executive.
And therefore you're showing
the straight world that
"I can be an executive.
"If I had the opportunity,
I could be one,
because I can look like one."

I won them for basketball.
And I had won trophies

I had on white hot pants,
a chiffon blouse,
a pony tail.
And my father was waiting
for the light in his car.
And he saw me.
He recognized me.
And he went straight to my house
before I could get there
and told my mother,
"your son is a woman."
She didn't press it then.
But, like,
maybe a few months later
when she noticed
that I had breasts,
everything started
coming together.
She really was devastated.
"How could you have breasts
bigger than mine?
"You're growing nails.
"You're becoming a woman
right before my very eyes.
"I can't hold my head up.
And she still loved me,
but the nagging and the...
oh, my God,
about this women's clothes.
And when I had women's clothes
stashed in my closet
and she found them,
she would destroy them.
She burnt up a mink coat.
I was, oh... Devastated.

in it that I liked to wear...
which was jungle gardenia
at the time...
and she said, "this ain't no girl's coat.

in the backyard of the building
and burned it.

And usually it's a category
for young queens.

that we're sick,
we're crazy.

that we are the most gorgeous,

to make myself complete.

and I used to do it

they... when they get out

because I've had kids come to me
and latch hold to me
like I'm their mother
or like I'm their father.

and I'm gay, and they're gay.

But this is a new meaning
of "family."
The hippies had families,
and no one thought
nothing about it.
It wasn't a question of
a man and a woman and children,
which we grew up knowing
as a family.
It's a question of a group of
human beings in a mutual bond.

You know what a house is?
I'll tell you what a house is.
A house is a gay street gang.
Now, where street gangs
get their rewards
from street fights,
a gay house street-fights
at a ball.
And you street-fight at a ball
by walking in the categories.
The houses started
because you wanted a name.
The people that the houses
are named after
were ball walkers
who became known for winning.
Emcee:
Work... Paris... Dupree.
Corey: After the first
few houses were started
and named after people
who had won trophies,
they also would create houses.
Like, a new group of kids
would just create a house,
then they'd work at building
its name up, which worked...

the house of Saint Laurent.

They saw me,
and they all liked me...

of the Xtravaganzas...
and they decided, "well, if you
want to become an Xtravaganza",
"you have to walk
a ball for us.
"And if you snatch a trophy,
then you can become
the Xtravaganza."
That's how it's supposed to
work with any... everyone.
But, uh...
Like, that wasn't with me.
I just became an Xtravaganza.
He's the one who started
the house.
He was the first gay man
I ever met.
The first time he took me
to the village...
which was my birthday...
I had just turned 15 years old.
And he threw a party
for me out there.
He bought me a cake.
I met a lot of drag queens,
transvestites,
that I didn't believe were
because they were so beautiful.
And that kind of
sunk into my head.
And I guess that's why
it kind of made me
want to even do it more.
They treat each other
like sisters, mm-hmm.
Sisters...
Or brothers...
Or mothers or...

But don't quote me on that.
I mean, it really
causes hate, actually,
between two individuals.
It's like a war on the floor.
Like world war III.
[ Laughs ]
But the only thing about it...
they're gay.
Emcee: Now... cut the music...
now, I said...
I said, "men's garments"!
Corey: He looked like
he had on a man's fox coat.
Tell this child,
where are the men's garments?
Man: I paid for it,
mother[Bleep]!
A man bought it!
It buttons on the right side!
The judges...
it buttons on the right side!
Corey: Someone came up
and told the emcee...
Are you a judge?!
That it was a woman's coat.
I thought it was kind of silly
to nitpick.
Ooh, that's shady!
They're throwing shade at him.
I can't believe it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, now.
Let's not get loud.
Now, David.
David. David.
That's the one thing that
I find faulty with the balls.
After they've laid down
these little categories,
then they try to
become a stickler
for exact interpretation...
merely a point to discredit
the contestant.
Like in an Olympics
where the Russian judge
brought to the fact
that the American coach
had stepped onto the floor,
and that was a disqualification
for the contestant...
just as picky as a ball.
So those little flaws
like that...
that's because
that's a part of shade.
That's the idea...
knock them out if you can.
Get them any way you...
hit them below the belt.
It was typed out!
The second...
where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Stop! No ball.
Shade comes from reading.
Reading came first.
Reading is the real
art form of insult.
Now, you want to
talk about reading?
Let's talk about reading.
What is wrong with you, Pedro?
Are you going through it?
You're going through
some kind of
psychological change
in your life?
She went back to be a man.
Oh, you went back
to being a man.
Touch this skin, darling.
Touch this skin, honey.
Touch all of this skin.
Okay?
You just can't take it.
You're just
an overgrown orangutan.
You get in a smart crack,
and everyone laughs
and kee-kees
because you found a flaw
and exaggerated it...
then you've got
a good read going.
I am a person just like you.
You cut me,
I bleed the same way you do.
I bleed the same color.
If it's happening between
the gay world
and the straight world,
It's more of an insult,
a vicious slur-fight.
See, see? There go my
sister right there.
She don't even want to even
admit that she my sister.
She a bulldagger.
[ Laughter ]
But it's how they develop
a sense of how to read.
That's my husband right there.
And that's my girlfriend
right there.
They may call you a faggot
or a drag queen.
You find something
to call them.
But then when you are
all of the same thing,
then you have to go
to the fine point.
In other words, if I'm a black
queen and you're a black queen,
we can't call each other black queens
'cause we're both black queens.
That's not a read.
That's just a fact.
So then we talk about
your ridiculous shape.
Your fa... saggy face.
Your tacky clothes.
Let me see what you are...
spreading lies!
Let's see. Oh!
No paint!
Yes, it's paint!
It's paint!
No mother[Bleep] paint, girl!
What? She wears more
makeup than my mother did!
Then reading
became a developed form
where it became shade.
Shade is
"I don't tell you you're ugly,
but I don't have to tell you
because you know you're ugly."
And that's shade.

the same thing as, like,
taking two knives
and cutting each other up,
but through a dance form.
Emcee:
Pump... Dip... Spin... Vogue.
Dip.
Go... Turn... It... Out.
Ninja:
Voguing came from shade
because it was a dance
that two people did
because they didn't
like each other.
Instead of fighting,
you would dance it out
on the dance floor.
And whoever
did the better moves
was throwing the best shade,
basically.
Emcee:
No touching.
Neither one of you.
If you touch, I'm chopping you.
I'm telling you right now.
Ninja: You could take the
pantomime form of the vogue...
this is what, generally,
sometimes I do
is I make my hand
into a form like a compact
or a makeup kit.
And I'm, like,
beating my face with blush,
shadows, or whatever,
to the music.
Then, usually, I'll turn
the compact around
to face that person...
meaning, like, almost like
my hand is a mirror...
for them to get a look.
Then I'll start doing
their face,
because what they have
on their face right now
needs a dramatic makeup job.
So voguing's like a safe form
of throwing shade.

the dance takes
from the hieroglyphics
of ancient Egypt.
It also takes from some
forms of gymnastics.
They both strive for
perfect lines in the body,
awkward positions, but it
goes one step further.
It's starting to make
a name for itself,
but I want it
to be known worldwide,
and I want to be on top
of it when it hits.
I want to take voguing not
to just Paris is burning,
but I want to take it
to the real Paris
and make the real Paris burn.
That's what I want to do,
and not just there,
but to other countries as well.
My house name is Ninja,
and I would really like to take
my whole house
and go to Japan...
And really let loose and do it
and have them accept it there.
I want to be a big star.
Uh, known, generally,
every corner of the world.
You know, maybe
as a choreographer,
a famous dancer,
a singer, or all of them.
What the balls
has to do with that,
as far as the dance field,
is maybe perfecting my craft
a little better,
to learn new things,
new ideas,
and bring them
to the real world.
It's been really unbelievable,
my life.
If I was to die today
or tomorrow,
I could not say I've not had
an exciting life.
I have had a fabu...
and I'm not rich, mind you.
Just imagine
if I had the dollars.
Ooh, it'd be too much
for the world.
If I had the riches
and I had the fame, trust me,
all of y'all in here
would be rich...
'Cause I'm very generous.
You know, I can't...
I wouldn't enjoy
having a whole lot of money,
like being a millionaire
and hoarding it, you know?
I'd share it
with all my loved ones.
You know, I'd want them
to have it, too.
We'd all have to go.

You own everything.
Everything is yours.
This is white America.
Any other nationality
that is not of the white set
knows this and accepts this
till the day they die.
That is everybody's dream
and ambition as a minority...
to live and look
as well as a white person.
It is pictured as being
in America.
Every media you have,
from TV to magazines
to movies to films...
I mean, the biggest thing that
minority watches is what?
"Dynasty" and "the Colbys."
Um, "all my children,"
the soap operas.
Everybody have
a million-dollar bracket.
When they showing you
a commercial from honey grahams
to crest or lestoil
or pine-sol,
everybody's in their own home.
The little kids

they're not
in no concrete playground.
They're riding around the lawn.
The pool is in the back.
This is white America.
And when it comes
to the minorities,
especially black...
We, as a people
for the past 400 years,
is the greatest example
of behavior modification
in the history of civilization.
We have had everything
taken away from us,
and yet we have
all learned how to survive.
That is why,
in the ballroom circuit,
it is so obvious
that if you have captured the
great white way of living...
Or looking...
Or dressing or speaking...
You is a marvel.
I think if I could just be
on TV or film or anything,
I'd do that
instead of the money.
Of course, I do want the money
because I want the luxury
that goes with it.
But...
I want to be wealthy.
If not wealthy,

I want to be somebody.

I can compare to Paulina,
to stand next to her
and to take pictures with her.
And I look at her here,
and I'd say she's seductive,
and she's alluring.
I look at her there, and I say
she's sexy and provocative.
I look at her here,

through the escort service
is being that I'm so little.
I'm so petite and tiny.
Um... The blond hair
and the light skin
and the green eyes
and the little features.
And the client's hands
will be bigger than my hands
while they would hold my hand
or something.
You know, they like feeling
that they're with something
perfect and little,
and not someone
that's bigger than them,
because I guess
that kind of disturbs them.
Most all the drag queens
that are involved in the balls,
they... 90% of them...
are hustlers.
I guess that's how
they make their money
to go to the balls
and get whatever they need.
I used to hustle in New York
to make my money.
I was with a guy, and he was
playing with my titties
till he touched me down there.
He felt it, and he seen it, and
he, like, totally flipped out.
He said, "you fucking faggot!
You're a freak."
"You're a victim of aids, and
you're trying to give me aids.
You're a homo.
I should kill you."

out the window.
I grabbed my bag
and just jumped out the window.
But see, now I don't like
to hustle anymore.
I don't, and I'm afraid
of what's going on...
the aids...
and I don't want to catch it.

I'm supposed to meet someone...
a friend of mine,
a very good old friend of mine.
He's a young, very good,
attractive, handsome young man.
And, um, he's taking me out
to dinner later on this evening,
or for cocktails
after midnight.
I know he'll give me
some money...
Just for me to maybe buy a pair
of shoes and a nice dress
so that the next time
he sees me...
He'll see me looking more
and more beautiful...
the way he wants to see me.
But I don't have to go
to bed with him
or anything like that.
At times,
they do expect sexual favors,
but that is between myself
and them,
so I do not wish to further
speak about that...
If they do.
But at most times,
99% of the time, they don't.
95% of the time, they don't.
But I feel like...
If you're married...
a woman in the suburbs,
a regular woman...
Is married to her husband,
and she wants him to buy her
a washer and dryer set...
In order for him to buy that,
I'm sure she'd have to go
to bed with him anyway
to give him what he wants
for her to get what she wants.

it all ends up the same way.

in the world today...

I guess I wouldn't want
anything but what I have now.

like I asked before,
does this square
with the women's lib movement?
Woman: Can I have a few
of you over here?
Okay, can I have
a few more women?
Woman ♪2: Hi, how you doing?
Good. How are you?
Fine. Nice to meet you, too.
I'm shari.
Shari, my name's Janet.
Hi, Janet. So you
want to be a model?
Yes. So you need an application.
Actually, I was in this contest.
That's how I started.
That's me.
I can't believe that.
Yeah, that's 5 years ago.
You still look great.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
We look at 75,000 pictures.
Well, you know,
that's the average amount
that we look at each contest.
What have girls become? Are
they... are they the same?
How are they different?
Girls are not different from
yesterday or the day before.
Everybody who's young
has a hope and a dream...
And I don't think that
it's ever been any different
in the history of the world.
I believe that
there's a big future out there
with a lot
of beautiful things...
A lot of handsome men...
A lot of luxury.
I want a car.
I want to be with a man I love.
I want a nice home
away from New York,
up the Peekskills
or maybe in Florida...
somewhere far
where no one knows me.
I want my sex change.
I want to live
a normal, happy life,
whether it's being married
and adopting children,
whether it's being famous
and rich.
I want to get married
in church in white.
Sometimes I sit,
and I look at a magazine.
I try to imagine myself
in the front cover
or even inside.
I want to be a complete woman,
and I want to be a professional
model behind cameras
in the high-fashion world.
I want so much more.
I want...
I want my name
to be a household product.
I want everybody to look at me
and say, "there goes octavia."
I want this.
This is what I want.
And I'm gonna go for it.

<I>Previously,</I>
<I>I, uh, introduced rap music</I>
along with dancing...
To Japanese people,
and they really loved it.
Woman: This, ladies
and gentlemen, is voguing,
a form of dance
that has its roots in Harlem...
a takeoff on runway modeling,
which they had plenty of
last night as well.
Voguing is an attitude,
a style.
It's... It's...
A kind of an institutionalized
showing off.
But not without
its entertainment value.
Something very spectacular,
very important... Art form.
Very important.
It's just so theatrical,
and the energy...
oh, it's just terrific.
Woman: In addition to perhaps
putting voguing in vogue,
this love ball sponsored by the
design industries foundation for aids
raised more than $350,000
for research
and housing for the homeless
who have aids.
And I have never seen anything
quite like it.

still teaching and trying to
perform on my own.
But now, my foot is, like,

that you can think of.
Um...
I'm doing a lot of runway work,
um, dancing... performing
for Malcolm Mclaren,
various other people,
doing choreography,
helping people
put their shows together.
So it's going very good.

This earring
that I have here, is...
I bought this in Japan.
As you can see,
it says "house couture."
I can't read the rest of it.
It has a scissor
and it has "Jr. Gaultier, '89"
on there, of course.
It's a Gaultier label emblem.
I bought it, mind you.
I have the receipt still...

The balls have kind of
gotten toned down
compared to what it used to be.
Now when I tell people
what it is,
and they go, and it's not
what they expect, you know,
it's like they feel, like, a
little bit of a letdown, you know?
And they say, "it was long, it
was dragged out, it was boring."
Okay, the balls are always long
and dragged out,
I really do kind of miss
the street element.
I mean, but everything changes,
and everything's
been changing drastically.
You know, um, New York's
not even the same anymore.

♪ Ooh, child
Angie: I always said to her, "Venus,
you take too many chances."
"You're too wild with people
in the streets.
But that was Venus.
She always took a chance.
She always went
into strangers' cars.
She always did what she wanted
to get what she wanted.
I had a booking
for a Christmas show at Sally's,
and the D.T.S came to me
with a picture of her murdered,
and they were
about to cremate her
'cause nobody had came
to verify the body,
and I was the one that
had to give all this information
down to her family.
Actually, they found her dead
after 4 days,
strangled under a bed in a
sleazy hotel in New York City.
I'm hungry.
and, you know, she was like my right
hand, as far as I'm concerned.
I miss her. Every time
I go anywhere, I miss her.
That was my main...
the main daughter of my house,
in other words.
But that's part of life,
as far as being a transsexual
in New York City and surviving.
I always had hopes
of being a big star.
And then I looked...
as you get older,
you aim a little lower.
And I just say, "well, yeah, you
still might make an impression."
Everybody wants to leave
something behind them...
some impression,
some mark upon the world.
Then you think...
You've left a mark
on the world...
If you just get through it...
And a few people
remember your name.
Then you left a mark.
You don't have to bend
the whole world.
I think it's better
to just enjoy it.
Pay your dues...
And enjoy it.
If you shoot an arrow
and it goes real high,
hooray for you.
