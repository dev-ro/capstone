REPORTER:
THIS IS WHERE IT BEGAN.
THIS IS WHERE THE
FUSE WAS LIGHTED.
IT BEGAN WITH THE ARREST
BY WHITE OFFICERS OF THE
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL
OF TWO YOUNG NEGROES.
ONE, ON A CHARGE OF
DRUNK DRIVING; THE OTHER,
HIS BROTHER; HIS PASSENGER.
THEIR MOTHER, WHO LIVES
NEARBY, CAME TO THE SCENE.
THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT;
THERE WAS A SCUFFLE.
BY THEN THE CROWD OF SEVERAL
HUNDRED NEGROES HAD GATHERED,
AND THE STORY OF POLICE
BRUTALITY QUICKLY SPREAD
THROUGH THE COMMUNITY.
REPORTER: UP THE STREET, A
BLOCK OR SO IN THAT DIRECTION,
A CHURCH, WHERE NEGRO
LEADERS PLEADED FOR PEACE
AND WERE REJECTED.
DOWN THAT WAY, THE BUSY
INTERSECTION WHERE CARS WERE
OVERTURNED AND BURNED; WHERE
A TELEVISION TECHNICIAN WAS
PULLED FROM HIS WAGON, AND
ALMOST BEATEN TO DEATH.
REPORTER: IT WAS
THE MOST WIDESPREAD,
MOST DESTRUCTIVE RACIAL
VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
THE BURNING AND LOOTING, THE
SHOOTING AND BEATING WENT ON
FOR NEARLY A WEEK.
34 PERSONS WERE KILLED,
ALL BUT 5 OF THEM NEGROES.
REPORTER: POLICE CHIEF
PARKER DESCRIBED LOS ANGELES
NEGRO RIOTERS AS
"MONKEYS IN A ZOO."
AND NEGRO LEADERS
HAVE MORE THAN ONCE CALLED
FOR HIS REMOVAL.
REPORTER: IN CREATING
THE SITUATION,
WHERE WAS THE FAILURE?
IN THE PART OF THE CITY,
THE COUNTY, THE SCHOOLS?
CHIEF PARKER: THIS, I THINK,
IS ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN
MEETING THIS IS THAT WE'RE
TRYING TO FIND A FAILURE OTHER
THAN THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.
NOW THIS IS A VERY
DANGEROUS MOVE BECAUSE IT,
IT SERVES TO SORT OF
SANCTIFY THEIR ACTS.
JOHN SHABAZ: EVERY
GRIEVANCE THAT WAS HAD BY
THE PEOPLE WHO
STARTED THIS THING,
THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING
DONE TO SOLVE IT.
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS
DONE WAS THAT MASSIVE FORCES
WERE BROUGHT IN TO SUPPRESS
THE ACTUAL OVERT ACTION.
REPORTER: HOW HAS
IT AFFECTED YOU?
MAN: JUST GETTING TIRED OF
BEING PUSHED AROUND BY YOU
WHITE PEOPLE, THAT'S ALL.
REPORTER: HOW PUSHED AROUND?
HOW BADLY?
IN WHAT WAY?
MAN: JUST STOPPING US ON THE
STREET, KICKING IN THE DOORS,
TAKEN DOWN TO THE
POLICE STATION,
THEY KICKING YOUR TEETH IN.
REPORTER: WELL THEY'RE
STOPPING PEOPLE ON THE STREET
NOW, BUT I MEAN, THEY
WEREN'T STOPPING PEOPLE IN
THE STREET WHEN THIS STARTED.
MAN: OH YEAH, BUT I'M
NOT THINKING ABOUT NOW.
OH, THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT
A LONG TIME BEFORE NOW.
TOM NEWSOME: DURING
THIS ENTIRE INCIDENT,
WE'VE HEARD CONSTANT
REFERENCES TO RESPECT FOR
LAW AND ORDER, AND
MORE PARTICULARLY,
WHAT THEY MEAN IS RESPECT
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.
NOW TO REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE PROBLEMS OF THESE PEOPLE,
YOU'D HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS
MEANT TO THEM
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WHITE
MAN'S LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT'S
RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF
THEIR PARENTS BEING CHASED
OUT OF THE SOUTH
ON ONE PRETEXT OR ANOTHER.
UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS YOU
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE
AREN'T GOING TO BE REVERENT
ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
THE MEN WHO ENFORCE THE LAW.
REPORTER: WHAT WOULD
MAKE IT BETTER?
WHAT WOULD MAKE ALL
THE RIOTING STOP?
MAN: I DON'T THINK
IT'D EVER STOP, REALLY.
REPORTER: NEVER?
MAN: I MEAN, IT MAY
NOT BE LIKE THIS,
BUT IT'LL NEVER STOP.
I DON'T THINK.
BILL STOUT: THE MCCONE
COMMISSION SOUGHT TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS ABOUT WATTS.
CAN IT HAPPEN AGAIN?
SO SERIOUS AND EXPLOSIVE
IS THE SITUATION,
SAYS THE COMMISSION, THAT
UNLESS IT IS CHECKED,
THE AUGUST RIOTS MAY
BE ONLY A CURTAIN RAISER TO
WHAT COULD BLOW UP
ONE DAY IN THE FUTURE.
WHAT SHALL IT
AVAIL OUR NATION,
IF WE CAN PLACE A
MAN ON THE MOON,
BUT CANNOT CURE THE
SICKNESS IN OUR CITIES?
THIS IS BILL STOUT

CROWD: OF THE UNITED

DAN RATHER: AN UNUSUAL
TWIST IN A CASE OF ALLEGED
RACE-BASED POLICE
BRUTALITY IN LOS ANGELES.
NEITHER THE POLICE NOR THE
SUSPECT KNEW THAT A HOME VIDEO
CAMERA HAD CAPTURED THE SCENE.
REPORTER: IT BEGAN AS A
HIGH-SPEED CHASE AND ENDED
EARLY SUNDAY MORNING
WITH THE MOTORIST,
A BLACK MALE BEING
BRUTALLY BEATEN AND KICKED.
REPORTER: THE VICTIM WAS
STRUCK AS MANY AS 56 TIMES,
AND SUFFERED SEVERAL
BROKEN BONES.
LAWYER: 56 TIMES.
THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC SAW ON VIDEOTAPE.
REPORTER: GEORGE HOLLIDAY
LIVES ACROSS THE STREET.
HE HAD HIS VIDEO CAMERA OUT
AND RECORDED WHAT HAPPENED AS
THE SUSPECT WAS
BEING ARRESTED.
GEORGE HOLLIDAY: GOT MY
CAMERA SORT OF READY AND LOOKED
ACROSS THE STREET AND
THAT'S WHEN I SAW THAT THE
ACTION WAS GOING ON.
CNN REPORTER: THE
SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AS
RODNEY GLEN KING.
REPORTER: KING, WHO IS MARRIED
AND HAS TWO STEP CHILDREN,
WAS ON PAROLE AFTER SERVING
TIME FOR ARMED ROBBERY.
HIS WIFE SAYS THAT'S NO
EXCUSE FOR WHAT HAPPENED.
CRYSTAL KING: IT WAS
A TRAFFIC VIOLATION.
HOW COME THEY JUST COULDN'T
ARREST HIM AND GIVE HIM SOME
KIND OF FINE OR SOMETHING?
WHY DID THEY HAVE TO BEAT
THE MESS OUT OF HIM LIKE THAT?
REPORTER: DOCTORS SAID THAT
HE SUFFERED A CONCUSSION.
ONE OF HIS EYE SOCKETS
WAS PULVERIZED.
HIS CHEEKBONE WAS SO PUSHED
IN FROM THE BLOWS TO HIS FACE
THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY.
STEVEN LERMAN: FROM
WHAT I'VE SEEN,
NONE OF THE PRISONERS
OF WAR FROM AMERICAN FORCES
TAKEN BY SADDAM HUSSEIN
CAME BACK BEATEN THAT BADLY.
REPORTER: LOS ANGELES
POLICE SAY THE INCIDENT WAS
NOT RACIALLY MOTIVATED,
BUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS
NOT BUYING THAT.
ABOUT 300 MEMBERS
OF THE NAACP MARCHED ON
POLICE HEADQUARTERS TODAY.
[PROTESTORS
CHANTING INAUDIBLY].
DARYL GATES: THIS
IS AN ABERRATION.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.
WE HAD IN PLACE ALL OF THE
PROCEDURES THAT WOULD KEEP IT
FROM HAPPENING.
THOSE PROCEDURES FELL DOWN
BECAUSE OF HUMAN ERROR.
REPORTER: THE ACLU SAID IT
RECEIVES ABOUT 55 CALLS A WEEK
FROM PEOPLE ALLEGING
POLICE BRUTALITY.
RAMONA RIPSTON: THE INCIDENT
EARLY SUNDAY MORNING IS
NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.
THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME
IS THAT WE HAVE THE PROOF.
STEVEN LERMAN: WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE AUDIO?
REPORTER: DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA AT ALL HOW MANY TIMES
YOU WERE HIT BY A CLUB?
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT
THAT AFTER [INAUDIBLE]?
RODNEY KING: SEVERAL
TIMES, SEVERAL TIMES.
AND THEN STOMPED AND KICKED.
STEVEN LERMAN: PICK UP YOUR.
REPORTER: LIFT YOUR SHIRT.
STEVEN LERMAN:
THIS IS SOMETHING.
RODNEY KING: LIKE THIS?
STEVEN LERMAN:
SEE THIS, SEE THAT?
REPORTER: [INAUDIBLE]
WHAT IS THAT FROM?
RODNEY KING: THAT'S FROM,
UM, SOME KIND OF DEVICE
THAT THEY USED.
THEY, UM, SH, SHOCKED ME.
THEY GOT A BIG
KICK OUT OF THAT.
REPORTER: WHAT MAKES YOU SAY
THEY GOT A KICK OUT OF IT?
RODNEY KING: BECAUSE OF HOW
LONG THEY LEFT IT IN ME.
YOU KNOW?
IT WAS LIKE THEY HAD A
LITTLE TOY AND THEY WANTED TO
SEE HOW IT WORKED.
REPORTER: WHAT KINDS
OF THINGS DID YOU HEAR
FROM THE OFFICERS?
DID YOU HEAR ANY
KIND OF SLURS AT ALL?
RODNEY KING: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT SLURS?
REPORTER: WERE THERE
ANY KIND OF RACIAL COMMENTS
MADE AT ALL?
RODNEY KING: OH, RACIAL?
NO, I DIDN'T, NO,
I DIDN'T HEAR ANY.
MAN: WELL YOU CAN CUT THIS
FROM THE TAPE IF, IF YOU WANT,
BUT ROD'S FAMILY HAS,
UH, MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING
TO TURN THIS INTO A, UH,
RACIAL CRUSADE.
STEVEN LERMAN: MR. KING
DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE, UH,
MAKE IT OUT AS THOUGH THEY
DID THIS JUST BECAUSE HE
WAS A BLACK MAN.
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN INCIDENTAL
TO IT AND THERE MAY BE
PERSONAL MOTIVES THAT
THESE OFFICERS HAD THAT
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YET.
BUT AT THE PRESENT TIME,
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT.
MAN: WHAT WE GOT, LARRY?

IRA REINER: AS YOU KNOW,
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN
INVESTIGATION INTO THE BEATING
OF RODNEY KING.
AND I'M ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT
WE HAVE OBTAINED INDICTMENTS
AGAINST FOUR LOS ANGELES
POLICE OFFICERS FOR THEIR ROLE
IN THE BEATING OF MR. KING.
LAPD OFFICER LAURENCE
POWELL, TIMOTHY WIND,
THEODORE BRISENO AND SERGEANT
STACEY KOON HAVE BEEN INDICTED
FOR ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY
WEAPON AND FOR EXCESSIVE USE
OF FORCE UNDER
COLOR OF AUTHORITY.
OFFICER POWELL AND WIND AND
SERGEANT KOON ARE FURTHER
CHARGED WITH INFLICTING
GREAT BODILY INJURY IN THE
BRUTAL ATTACK THAT HAS
NOW BEEN WITNESSED BY
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THESE
ARE FELONIES PUNISHABLE BY
UP TO SEVEN YEARS
IN STATE PRISON.
SERGEANT KOON AND OFFICER
POWELL HAVE ALSO BEEN INDICTED
FOR FILING FALSE REPORTS.
ALL FOUR OFFICERS
SURRENDERED THIS MORNING TO
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
THEY HAVE BEEN ARRESTED,
FINGER PRINTED,

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

RECOMMENDATION AT THE

FOR THE OFFICERS?
[INAUDIBLE COURTROOM CHATTER].
[NEWSCAST OPENING MUSIC].
ANNOUNCER: THIS IS WORLD NEWS
TONIGHT WITH PETER JENNINGS.
SITTING IN TONIGHT IN
WASHINGTON, TED KOPPEL.
TED KOPPEL: GOOD EVENING.
THE EVIDENCE IS
NEW, IT'S DRAMATIC,
AND IT'S DEVASTATING TO THOSE
LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFICERS
INVOLVED IN THE
MARCH 3RD BEATING OF
THAT BLACK MOTORIST.
REPORTER: ONE OF THE TWO
OFFICERS WHO WIELDED BATONS
THAT EVENING RELAYED A
MESSAGE AFTER THE ARREST TO
ANOTHER CAR SAYING, QUOTE:
"SOUNDS ALMOST AS
EXCITING AS OUR LAST CALL.
IT WAS RIGHT OUT OF
GORILLAS IN THE MIST."
ONE POLICEMAN INVOLVED
IN THE BEATING SAID QUOTE,
"I HAVEN'T BEATEN ANYONE
THIS BAD IN A LONG TIME."
ANOTHER JOKED LATER SAYING,
"I'M SURE THE LIZARD
DIDN'T DESERVE IT."
MAYOR TOM BRADLEY SAID
THE TRANSCRIPT RAISES MORE
QUESTIONS ABOUT
POLICE COMMAND.
TOM BRADLEY: I THINK IT HAS
BEEN DEVASTATING TO THE IMAGE
OF THE CITY AND ESPECIALLY
TO OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT.
JOHN MACK: IT'S VERY
APPARENT THAT SOME, NOT ALL,
BUT SOME OF THOSE OFFICERS
ARE CLEARLY OUT OF CONTROL AND
THEY HAVE TO ULTIMATELY BE
WILLING TO TAKE A GOOD HARD
LOOK AT THE LEADERSHIP
OF THE DEPARTMENT.
CROWD: GATES GOT TO GO, NOW.
GATES GOT TO GO NOW.
GATES GOT TO GO, NOW.
GATES GOT TO GO, NOW.
GATES GOT TO GO, NOW.
GATES GOT TO GO, NOW.
ZEV YARLOSLAVSKY:
MR. PRESIDENT,
ALL OF US I THINK
HAVE BEEN, UH,
STUNNED BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
AND, UH, I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT
THE CHIEF OR ANYBODY ELSE IN
THE CITY WOULD CONDONE
THE KIND OF, UH,
CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE
BOTH ELECTRONICALLY AND BY
VOICE, UH, IN THAT FOOTHILL
DIVISION THAT NIGHT.
BLACKS ARE NOT ANIMALS.
THEY'RE NOT LIZARDS.
THEY'RE NOT APES.
THEY'RE NOT GORILLAS ANY
MORE THAN ANY OF US ARE.
THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS.
THE FIRST WAY TO OPEN THE DOOR
TO BRUTALIZING PEOPLE IN ANY,
ANY PLACE IS TO CHEAPEN
THEIR WORTH AS HUMAN BEINGS.
AND WHEN I READ THE
TRANSCRIPTS OF THE
CONVERSATION I WAS APPALLED.
BUT THE ABILITY TO FREELY
CONVERSE IN RACIST TERMINOLOGY
SUGGESTS A LEVEL OF TOLERANCE
FOR THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION
THAT, UH, THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE
BY ANY STANDARD OF DECENCY.
DARYL GATES: WELL
FIRST OF ALL IS, UH,
THIS IS A DEPARTMENT THAT
THIS COUNCIL HAS SUPPORTED
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
THIS IS A POLICE DEPARTMENT
THAT HAS SUPPORTED YOU,
EACH OF YOU.
I JUST TELL YOU THIS.
IF YOU DON'T SPEAK OUT ON
BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF
THE LOS ANGELES POLICE
DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE SERVED
THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY WELL,
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT AT THIS
CRUCIAL MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY,
THEN I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A POLICE
DEPARTMENT THAT IS NOT GOING
TO BE THE KIND OF
DEPARTMENT THAT YOU WANT,
THE KIND OF DEPARTMENT
THE PEOPLE DESERVE.
MAN: MR. WOO.
MR. WOO: THANK YOU.
UH, I WANT TO KNOW DID
YOU MEAN THAT AS A THREAT?
IN OTHER WORDS THAT IF, IF,
IF I OR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE
COUNCIL ARE GOING TO BE
CRITICIZING YOU OR THE
DEPARTMENT, ARE YOU
SAYING THAT YOU WILL,
WILL WITHHOLD SUPPORT OF
THESE SERVICES TO FIGHT CRIME
IN OUR DISTRICTS?
DARYL GATES: THAT IS THE MOST
INSULTING THING I HAVE HEARD
ON THIS COUNCIL FLOOR IN ALL
THE TIME I'VE BEEN HERE AND
I'VE BEEN HERE A LOT LONGER
THAN YOU'VE BEEN ALIVE.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL
ORGANIZATION.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE?
[INAUDIBLE COURTROOM CHATTER].
MAN: HE SHOVED ME
UP AGAINST THE WALL AND
STARTED TO STRANGLE ME.
I COULD NOT BREATHE.
THEY TRIED TO KICK
ME IN THE TESTICLES.
HE THREW ME ASIDE AND SAID,
"GET THE (BLEEP)
OUT OF HERE NOW."
THAT IS THE LAPD.
[APPLAUSE].
MAN 2: WE FOUND ONE CASE
WHERE A DOG ATTACKED AND
BIT THE CHEST OF
A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
THE DOGS ARE QUITE
LARGE AND AGGRESSIVE.
THEY WILL RIP AWAY
FLESH AND MUSCLE.
THEY WILL TEAR OUT BLOOD
VESSELS AND THEY WILL
SOMETIMES BREAK BONES.
MAN: THE POLICE SEND
OUR KIDS COMPLETELY
CONFLICTING MESSAGES.
THEY'RE IN OUR SCHOOLS
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
AND YET OUR KIDS SEE THEM ON
TV BEATING A MAN LIKE A DOG.
MAN 2: THE POLICE ARE
TRAINED TO APPROACH BLACK MEN
AS CRIMINALS FIRST
AND CITIZENS SECOND.
MAN 3: BUT BEFORE YOU
LEAVE SOUTH CENTRAL,
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT
VERBAL ABUSE HAPPENS HERE
EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT:
"GET OUT OF THE CAR, NIGGER.
ASSUME THE POSITION, NIGGER.
SIT ON THE CURB, NIGGER.
LIE FACE DOWN ON
THE GROUND, NIGGER."
WE'RE SAYING THIS IS
WHAT WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH.
AND WHEN WE SPEAK OUT,
THE FIRST THING THEY SAY IS,
"WHY ARE THEY
GETTING SO RESTLESS?
WHY SHOULD NOT
WE GET RESTLESS?
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
TAKING THIS TO THE STREETS AND
WE AIN'T TALKING
ABOUT JUST MARCHING.
[APPLAUSE].

OVER THE BACKPACK.
AND UH, AS OUR VICTIM UH,

A WEAPON AND SHOT THE VICTIM
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.
WOMAN: LATASHA WAS A 'A'
STUDENT, HONOR ROLL STUDENT.
SHE GOT MONEY EVERY WEEK FOR
HER ALLOWANCE SO SHE DID NOT
HAVE TO STEAL ORANGE JUICE.
REPORTER: THE STORE CLERK,
A KOREAN WOMAN,
IS NOW IN JAIL.
THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS
OUTRAGED OVER THE KILLING.
THE NAACP IS DEMANDING THE
CLERK BE TRIED FOR MURDER.
CROWD: WE WANT JUSTICE.
STOP KILLING OUR CHILDREN.
WE WANT JUSTICE!
STOP KILLING OUR CHILDREN.
REPORTER: THE CASE HAS BECOME
A SYMBOL OF TENSIONS BETWEEN
TWO LARGE GROUPS IN THIS
ETHNICALLY DIVERSE CITY,
AFRICAN AMERICANS
AND THE KOREANS,
WHO'VE BECOME SUCCESSFUL
MERCHANTS IN MANY OF THE
POOREST BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS.
AS MANY AS 300,000 KOREANS
LIVE IN LOS ANGELES,
MANY OF THEM IN AN AREA
KNOWN AS KOREATOWN.
SOME BLACKS SEE THE KOREANS
AS A MERCHANT CLASS THAT TAKES
ADVANTAGE OF THE
BLACK COMMUNITY.
WOMAN: WHY DON'T YOU OPEN
A MARKET THAT WE CAN USE
FOR OUR FAMILY?
MAN: GO BACK TO KOREA.
EDWARD CHANG: WE ARE DEEPLY
CONCERNED THAT THIS INCIDENT
MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO
THE POSITIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN
THE TWO COMMUNITIES.
IN ORDER TO
STRENGTHEN OUR BONDS,
WE WILL ACTIVELY JOIN WITH
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY
TO DEVELOP MEASURES TO
PREVENT FURTHER TRAGEDY.

OF VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER IN
VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE
SECTION 192A, A FELONY.
A LESSOR INCLUDED OFFENSE
TO THAT CHARGE IN [INAUDIBLE]
OF THE INDICTMENT.
WE FURTHER FIND THE ALLEGATION
THAT IN THE COMMISSION.
JUDGE KARLIN: IT IS
NOW A TIME FOR HEALING.
IT IS NOT A TIME FOR RHETORIC,
WHICH SERVES NO PURPOSE
OTHER THAN TO FUEL THE FIRE.
IT'S LIKE THROWING
GASOLINE ON A FIRE
THAT'S ALREADY BURNING.
IT IS MY OPINION THAT
MRS. DU IS NOT A DANGER TO
THE COMMUNITY AND THAT
SHE IS NOT GOING TO REOFFEND.
I KNOW A CRIMINAL
WHEN I SEE ONE.
I KNOW A PERSON WHO PRESENTS
A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY
WHEN I SEE ONE.
WHEN I DON'T, I TREAT
THAT PERSON AS SOMETHING
OTHER THAN THAT.
WOMAN: SHE GOT
AWAY WITH MURDER.
MAN: GODDAMN, SURE HOPE SO
THAT THERE WILL BE ALL THE
HELL IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.
WOMAN: I HOPE
SOMEBODY WOULD CARE.
MAN: AND WOULD
STAND UP AND SEE THIS INSANITY
FOR EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
WOMAN: ABOUT THE DEATH OF A
CHILD, YOU CAN MURDER A CHILD.
MAN: BLACK PEOPLE, ONCE AGAIN,
BEING UNJUSTLY TREATED BY THE.
WOMAN: AND WALK AWAY,
AND STAY ON THE STREET.
MAN: GET THE CAMERAS OFF.
GET THE CAMERA OUT OF MY FACE.
WOMAN: SINCE WE DON'T
PICK COTTON ANYMORE,

WE'RE, OUR LIVES IS NOT,
NOT WORTH ANYTHING?
RICHARD.
MAN: GET OUT OF MY FACE.
WOMAN: RICHARD, RICHARD.

WOMAN: GET HIM
ON THE ELEVATOR.
SHUT THE DOOR.
MAXINE WATERS: UNFORTUNATELY,
A JUDGE WHO'S PROBABLY NEVER
BEEN DOWN HERE, A JUDGE WHO
PROBABLY KNOWS VERY LITTLE
ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY.
A JUDGE DECIDED THAT THE
LIFE WAS NOT VALUABLE ENOUGH.
MAN: LATASHA WAS KILLED,
OUR FAMILY WAS KILLED.
RACISM IS NOT THE
KOREAN KILLING HER,
RACISM IS THE COURT SYSTEM
THAT ALLOWS HER TO KILL HER.
DANNY BAKEWELL: WE
HAVE TO SHOW LOS ANGELES
THAT WE ARE RESILIENT.
AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE

A CHANGE A VENUE IN THE TRIAL
OF THE FOUR POLICE OFFICERS
CHARGED IN CONNECTION
WITH THE BEATING OF
MOTORIST RODNEY KING.
JUDGE KAMINS: THE CHANGE
OF VENUE MOTION IS GREATLY
ENTWINED WITH WHETHER
WE CAN GET JURORS,
AND I'M VERY CONCERNED
WHETHER WE CAN GET JURORS
WHO ARE UNTAINTED.
REPORTER: OTHER
HIGH-PROFILE CASES,
SUCH AS THOSE OF CHARLES
MANSON AND ROBERT KENNEDY
ASSASSIN SIRHAN SIRHAN
WERE NOT TRANSFERRED OUT
OF LOS ANGELES DESPITE
HIGH PUBLICITY.
BUT DEFENSE ATTORNEYS
SAY THIS CASE IS DIFFERENT.
JOHN BARNETT: EVERYONE
HAS OPINION ON THE UH,
GUILT OR INNOCENCE
OF THESE DEFENDANTS,
AND THAT'S WHY IT WOULD
BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET
A FAIR TRIAL HERE.
REPORTER: TO MOVE
THE TRIAL AWAY FROM THE
SWARMING CONTROVERSY
IN THE L.A. MEDIA,
THE VENUE WAS
CHANGED TO THE SIMI VALLEY,
A MOSTLY WHITE SUBURB
OF LOS ANGELES WHERE MANY
POLICE OFFICERS LIVE.
SIMI VALLEY IS A
TOWN OF 100,000 PEOPLE
JUST 35 MILES NORTH

GET DOWN ON THE GROUND,
A SERIES OF THOSE COMMANDS.
ATTORNEY: A SERIES?
LAURENCE POWELL: YES.
ATTORNEY: YOU REPEATED IT?
LAURENCE POWELL: RIGHT.
ATTORNEY: AND, UH, TELL
THE JURY WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.
LAURENCE POWELL: A, I
CONTINUED TO HIT HIM AND THEN
KNOCKED HIM TO THE GROUND,
YELLED AT HIM TO STAY ON THE
GROUND AND HE REPEATED
THE MOTION AGAIN,
GETTING UP AGAIN.
I WAS COMPLETELY IN
FEAR FOR MY LIFE,
SCARED TO DEATH THAT IF THIS
GUY GOT BACK UP HE WAS GONNA
TAKE MY GUN AWAY FROM ME, OR
THERE WAS GONNA BE A SHOOTING,
AND I WAS DOING EVERYTHING
I COULD TO KEEP HIM DOWN
ON THE GROUND.
ATTORNEY: AT ANY TIME DURING
THIS EVENING DID IT GO THROUGH
YOUR MIND THAT THIS
WAS NOT A HUMAN BEING THAT
YOU WERE BEATING?
LAURENCE POWELL: NO.
ATTORNEY: UM, HE WASN'T
AN ANIMAL, WAS HE?
LAURENCE POWELL: NO, SIR,
JUST ACTING LIKE ONE.
ATTORNEY: HE WASN'T, HE
WAS JUST ACTING LIKE ONE?
LAURENCE POWELL: YES, SIR.
ATTORNEY: WAS HE
ACTING LIKE A GORILLA?
LAURENCE POWELL: NO, SIR.
ATTORNEY: NOW THIS CALL
THAT INVOLVED THESE AFRICAN
AMERICANS, WAS IT IN A JUNGLE?
LAURENCE POWELL: IN A WHAT?
ATTORNEY: A JUNGLE.
LAURENCE POWELL: NO.
ATTORNEY: WAS IT AT THE ZOO?
LAURENCE POWELL: NO.
ATTORNEY: WERE THERE
ANY GORILLAS AROUND?
LAURENCE POWELL:
I DIDN'T SEE ANY.
ATTORNEY: SERGEANT, WHAT
ARE YOU WATCHING DURING
ALL OF THIS?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING WHEN
YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THIS?
STACEY KOON: I'M
THINKING THAT, UH,
MR. KING HAS
BEEN SUBJECTED TO, UH,
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF,
UH, UH, PAIN
AND HE'S, UH, NOT,
IT'S ALMOST AS IF HIS BODY
IS ANESTHETIZED TO THE PAIN.
ATTORNEY: WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING NOW?
STACEY KOON: I WAS THINKING
THAT I HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OF
UH, THE USE OF FORCE THAT
I HAVE SHORT OF DEADLY FORCE
AT THIS TIME.
I'M THINKING AT THIS
TIME I'M EITHER GONNA HAVE
TO USE A
CHOKEHOLD OR MY WEAPON.
ATTORNEY: AND WHY DIDN'T YOU
WANT TO USE A CHOKEHOLD, SIR?
STACEY KOON: BECAUSE,
UM, IN LOS ANGELES THE
CHOKEHOLD, UH, IS ASSOCIATED
WITH DEATH OF BLACKS.
ATTORNEY: HOW DO YOU VIEW
LOOKING AT THIS VIDEOTAPE, SIR?
STACEY KOON: IT'S
VIOLENT AND IT'S BRUTAL.
ATTORNEY: WAS THIS
ANYTHING THAT YOU ENJOYED?
STACEY KOON: NO.
ATTORNEY: WHY WAS IT DONE?
STACEY KOON: IT'S
DONE TO CONTROL, UH,
AN AGGRESSIVE COMBATIVE
SUSPECT AND SOMETIMES POLICE
WORK IS BRUTAL.
THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE.
REPORTER: EVERY DAY, REGULAR
FOLKS FROM THE PUBLIC FILE IN
TO WATCH THE TRIAL AND YOU CAN
TOO IF YOU CAN BEAT THE RUSH.
WOMAN: ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE.
UM, WE HAVE 17 SEATS
ALLOCATED FOR THE, UM, PUBLIC.
HOWEVER, THE OTHER SEATS
THAT WE HAVE RESERVED,
IF PEOPLE DON'T SHOW UP
FOR THOSE SEATS THEN WE
IMMEDIATELY OPEN THEM
UP TO THE PUBLIC.
REPORTER: IF YOU WANT
TO COME HERE THOUGH,
HERE'S A LITTLE ADVICE.
WOMAN: THEY SHOULD DRESS
APPROPRIATELY FOR COURT,
OF COURSE.
UM, NOTHING THAT SAYS
ANYTHING ABOUT THE TRIAL ITSELF
OR ANY TYPE OF RACIAL SLURS,
UM, ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE
MISCONSTRUED BY ANYONE.
SECURITY: WELL ANYWAY,
COURT ORDER COVERS THAT.
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER
SHIRT IN THE CAR?
MAN: I'LL LOOK AND SEE.
SECURITY:
OTHERWISE [INAUDIBLE].
ATTORNEY: STOPPING
THE VIDEO AT 03:51:02,
HAVE YOU SEEN MR. KING
SWING AT ANYONE?
GEORGE DUKE: NO, I HAVEN'T.
ATTORNEY: UH, HAVE YOU
SEEN HIM PUNCH AT ANYONE?
GEORGE DUKE: NO, I HAVEN'T.
ATTORNEY: IS YOUR TESTIMONY
THEN AT ANY POINT AFTER
03:42:20, ANY BATON BLOW
RECEIVED BY MR. KING IS
UNREASONABLE AND UNNECESSARY?
MICHAEL BOSTIC:
YES SIR, IT IS.
DARRYL MOUNGER: HAD
SERGEANT KOON NOT BEEN THERE
TO CONTROL THAT SITUATION,
AS UGLY AS IT LOOKS,
RODNEY KING WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN HOME NOW.
AND MAYBE SERGEANT KOON
WOULD HAVE HAD TO GO TELL
SOME OFFICER'S FAMILY WHY
THEY DIDN'T COME HOME.
TERRY WHITE: YOU'VE
GOT THIS MAN DOWN.
HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.
HE'S NOT TRYING TO ESCAPE.
HE'S NOT TRYING TO RESIST.
WHEN YOU REACH THAT POINT
ON THAT TAPE WHERE YOU SAY,
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, THAT'S WHEN
UNREASONABLE FORCE STARTS.
JOHN BARNETT: OUR WHOLE SYSTEM
OF JUSTICE IS BASED ON THE
BELIEF THAT IF WE GET TWELVE
PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY TO
FAIRLY AND DISPASSIONATELY
DECIDE THIS ISSUE,
DEVOID OF PREJUDICE AND BIAS,
THEN THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT,
JUSTICE WILL BE DONE.
THINK AHEAD AND MAKE A
DECISION NOW ABOUT WHICH YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO SAY YEARS FROM
NOW, "I WAS TRUE TO MY OATH.
I WAS TRUE TO THE LAW.
I WAS TRUE TO MYSELF."

FEMALE REPORTER: THE DISPUTED
VERDICT WAS RETURNED AFTER A
WEEK OF DELIBERATIONS
AT THE END OF A LONG AND
CLOSELY WATCHED TRIAL.
REPORTER: THE JUROR SAID
RACISM DIDN'T ENTER INTO THE
JURY'S DELIBERATIONS.
NONE OF THE JURORS IS BLACK.
THERE WERE TEN WHITES,
ONE ASIAN, AND ONE HISPANIC.
TOM BRADLEY: TODAY, THIS
JURY TOLD THE WORLD THAT WHAT
WE ALL SAW, WITH OUR
OWN EYES, WASN'T A CRIME.
TODAY, THAT JURY ASKED US
TO ACCEPT THE SENSELESS AND
BRUTAL BEATING OF
A HELPLESS MAN.
TODAY, THAT JURY SAID THAT WE
SHOULD TOLERATE SUCH CONDUCT
BY THOSE WHO ARE SWORN
TO PROTECT AND SERVE.
MY FRIENDS, I'M HERE
TO TELL THIS JURY, NO.
NO, OUR EYES DID
NOT DECEIVE US.
WE SAW WHAT WE SAW, AND
WHAT WE SAW WAS A CRIME.
PROTESTOR: YOU GOT
ANOTHER WHITE JURY AH,
SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY
FOR WHITE COPS TO BEAT
UP BLACK PEOPLE.
AND THAT'S RACISM,
AMERICAN STYLE,
AND IT'S BEEN THAT
WAY FROM THE GET.
JOHN SINGLETON: THEY'RE
MAKING IT BAD FOR ALL
THE GOOD COPS.
IF THEY'RE GONNA
LET DIRTY COPS OFF,
HOW'S THAT MAKE A GUY WHO'S
TRYING TO DO HIS JOB FEEL?
WOMAN: MY LITTLE BOY,
HE WANTED TO BE A COP
JUST LIKE HIS FATHER,
BUT AFTER SEEING THAT TAPE,
HE DOESN'T WANT TO
BE THAT ANYMORE.
NOW I HAVE TO
TRAIN HIM NOT TO.
JOHN HATCHER: FOR US
TO TRY TO GO BACK TO TELL
BLACK PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY
THAT JUSTICE IS BLIND,
THEY'LL SAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS SO BLIND THAT
THEY CAN'T SEE US.
IT IS SO BLIND TO WHENEVER
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ONE OF
US, WE GET THE MAX IF WE
DON'T GET KILLED FIRST.
AND SO IT IS BLIND.
WOMAN: WHERE'S MY JUSTICE?
MAN: THERE IS NO JUSTICE.
THERE IS NO JUSTICE.
WOMAN: LETTING, LETTING
A PERSON DRIVE DOWN IN MY
STREETS WITH A
BELLY FULL OF BEER.
REPORTER: BUT YOU
KNOW THAT OUT THERE,
THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE THAT AREN'T GOING
TO BE VERY HAPPY.
HOW WILL YOU RESPOND TO THEM?
WHAT WILL BE YOUR REACTION?
LAURENCE POWELL: OH,
I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO
RESPOND TO THEM.
THEY HAVE TO RESPOND
TO THEMSELVES,
MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS.
THEY HAVE ALL THE FACTS
IN FRONT OF 'EM, I WOULD HOPE.
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY
SHOULD BASE IT ON.
IT SHOULDN'T BE ANY SORT
OF AN EMOTIONAL THING.
MAN: I'M GLAD THAT YOU GUYS
SHOWED THIS TO THE WORLD TO
LET THEM SEE HOW BLACK PEOPLE
ARE TREATED IN THIS COUNTRY.
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
DID NOT RESPECT US.
WE, YOU, YOU FEEL
WE'RE SUBCREATURES.
IF I WENT AND BEAT,
WAIT A MINUTE, SWEETHEART.
IF I WENT AND BEAT YOUR DOG
THE WAY THEY BEAT THIS MAN,
I'D BE IN JAIL.
THESE GUYS ARE GOING
OUT, OUT TO HAVE A DRINK.
REPORTER: WHAT IMAGE OF LOS
ANGELES EMERGES FROM THIS
VERDICT, TO THE REST OF
THE COUNTRY DO YOU THINK?
TOM BRADLEY: WHY DON'T WE
SAY THE REST OF THE WORLD?
PRESIDENT BUSH STANDS UP TO
CHALLENGE LEADERS OF NATIONS
AROUND THE WORLD, UH, TO
AH, RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS,
AND TO NOT ENGAGE IN A DENIAL
OF THOSE RIGHTS TO CITIZENS.
THEY'RE GONNA LAUGH AT HIM.
THEY'RE GONNA POINT

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
ANOTHER BROTHER OFFICER
WON'T TURN YOU IN,
AND IF A BROTHER OFFICER
DOES TURN YOU IN, DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL GET WHITE JURORS
OR WHOEVER IT TAKES,
AND WE'LL, YOU'LL WALK.
AND YOU'RE PROTECTED
BY THIS SYSTEM.
YOU'RE BACKED UP

REPORTER: STEPHANIE,
IS THAT YOU?
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE
THAT TO HOW WIDESPREAD IS,
IS THE VIOLENCE BECAUSE IT'LL
BE HARD TO TALK ABOUT, OKAY?
WELL AT THIS EVENING,
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE
ARE ABOUT TWENTY FIRES BURNING,
MOSTLY IN
SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES.
THIS IS A PREDOMINANTLY
BLACK AREA OF THE CITY.
BOB TUR: THIS IS A
SUPER SWAPMEET LOCATION.
SOMEONE, ACTUALLY A GROUP OF
OVER 100 PEOPLE WENT INTO THIS
LOCATION AND LOOTED IT.
AND EVERY TIME THEY GO
IN AND LOOT, AFTER THEY,
THEY'RE DONE LOOTING, THEY
SET FIRE TO THE STRUCTURE.
MAN: I'M TIRED OF WHAT'S GOING
ON IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.
THEY SHOT LATASHA HARLINS.
THEY TOOK OUT MY BOY RODNEY
KING, BEAT HIM ON THE STREETS.
WHAT YOU NEED MORE

CLACK, CLACK, CLACK.
REPORTER: WE'RE HEARING FOR
THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT FROM
DARYL GATES, WHO IS
HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE.
LET'S GO TO HIM LIVE.
DARYL GATES: ONCE
AGAIN, I THINK, UH,
MOST OF IT'S
CONCENTRATED AT SOUTH CENTRAL
LOS ANGELES AREA.
BUT, UH, PROBLEM IS YOU FIND
MANY LOCATIONS WHERE THERE ARE
NO OFFICERS AND, UH,
THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED
AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO
THAT AS QUICK AS WE CAN.
[SIRENS].
MAN ON RADIO: UNREPORTED
STRUCTURE FIRE FOR LIGHT
4-64 DASH [INAUDIBLE].
MAN 2 ON RADIO: WE'RE TAKING
SOME PRETTY HEAVY SLACK ON
ADAMS ABOUT HOBART.
THERE ARE THREE
SEPARATE STRUCTURE FIRES.
MAN 3: WE'VE JUST
BEEN TAKEN OUT.
WE'VE GOT BOTTLES
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
UH, ONLY...
MAN 4 ON RADIO: UH, NEED,
UH, SOME PD IN THAT AREA AND
SOME FIRE
COMPANIES ASSIGNED.
MAN 5 ON RADIO: WE

BOB TUR: THEY'RE
DISPATCHING LAPD UNITS AH,
ALONG WITH ALL FIRE TRUCKS

TRYING TO GET LAPD SERVICE FOR
ANYTHING ELSE, FOLKS,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN DOWN THERE.

ROSS BECKER: THERE

[EXPLOSION]

PETE WILSON: I'M
ADVISED THAT, UH,
THERE IS SOMEONE FROM THE
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE ON
THE WAY OVER TO
ACCEPT THIS PROCLAMATION
OF A STATE EMERGENCY,
OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY
FOR LOS ANGELES CITY
AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY.
THIS IS, UH, IN RESPONSE TO
A REQUEST BY MAYOR BRADLEY.
AS A RESULT OF THE
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD,
THERE WILL BE AS MANY AS 750
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROLMEN.
ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE
MADE AVAILABLE SOME
2,000 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN.
THEY ARE ON STANDBY,
PREPARED TO, UH, MOVE.
TRANSPORT HAS BEEN ARRANGED.
AND IT IS OUR PURPOSE HERE AT
THE STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL TO
RESTORE LAW AND ORDER, AND
TO MINIMIZE THE DANGER TO THE
RESIDENTS OF THE AREA.
THIS IS A MATTER THAT NEEDS TO
BE SETTLED IN THE COURTS AND
NOT IN THE STREETS.
THANK YOU.
CROWD: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
JUSTICE.
WHEN DO YOU WANT IT?
NOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
JUSTICE?
WHEN DO YOU WANT IT?
NOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
JUSTICE?
WHEN DO YOU WANT IT?
NOW.
JIM: WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS
ARE SCRAMBLING AT THIS VERY
MOMENT, UH, TO PRODUCE A
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT BUSH.
NOBODY EXPECTED THAT VERDICT
THE WAY IT CAME DOWN.
THERE'S NOTHING REALLY THAT
THE WHITE HOUSE CAN DO ABOUT
THAT VERDICT BUT
IT DOES PRESENT A HUGE
POLITICAL PROBLEM.
MANY CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS
THOUGHT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH
HAS BEEN WEAK ON CIVIL
RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS PROMISES.
REPORTER: HAVE YOU HAD ANY
DISCUSSIONS WITH PRESIDENT BUSH,
EITHER ON THE TELEPHONE,
OR HAS THERE BEEN ANY FORM?
MAXINE WATERS: PRESIDENT
BUSH DOES NOT TALK TO US.
UH, LET'S, LET'S, LET'S, LET'S,
LET'S BE STRAIGHT ABOUT THIS.
AH, WE HAVE NO ACCESS
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE HAD ONE MEETING SINCE
I HAVE BEEN IN CONGRESS,
WITH THE PRESIDENT.
IT WAS PRO FORMA,
IT WAS COURTESY,
BUT THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP.
MAN: IS THAT WHO WE THOUGHT?
MAN 2: I THINK SO, YEAH.
JIM: ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
SAY THAT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT HAD IN FACT
LAUNCHED A CIVIL RIGHTS
INVESTIGATION INTO THE RODNEY
KING BEATING BUT ONCE STATE
CHARGES WERE BROUGHT THEY
SORT OF PUT THAT ON HOLD.
NOW IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS
MOMENT EXACTLY WHERE
THAT INVESTIGATION STANDS.
FAITH?
FAITH: IT WOULD ALMOST
SEEM AT THIS POINT, JIM,
THAT THEY'D HAVE TO
PICK IT UP AGAIN.
YOU CANNOT IGNORE THAT
ALL OF THIS IS COMING
IN A PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION YEAR.
GOV. CLINTON: YOU KNOW
THAT I DON'T THINK
HE'S DONE ENOUGH BUT I,
BUT I THINK WE HAVE
HAD TOO MUCH DIVISION AND
TOO LITTLE HARMONY.
I THINK THERE'S BEEN TOO
LITTLE EFFORT TO BRING PEOPLE
TOGETHER ACROSS RACIAL LINES.
THIS IS A HUMAN PROBLEM.
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER AND
DON'T TRUST THE SYSTEM.
AND THE POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS
TOO OFTEN DIVIDED PEOPLE BY
RACE AND THAT IS THE URGENT
TASK FOR AMERICA TODAY.
OUR DIVERSITY WILL
EITHER BE OUR UNDOING,
OR THE SOURCE OF OUR
GREATEST STRENGTH.
MAXINE WATERS: I AM ANGRY, AND
I HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT ANGER,
AND THE PEOPLE OUT THERE
HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT ANGER.
WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY KILLED.
NONE OF US BELIEVE
IN VIOLENCE.
BUT THERE ARE SOME
ANGRY PEOPLE IN AMERICA,
AND YOUNG BLACK
MALES, IN MY DISTRICT,
ARE FEELING AT THIS MOMENT,
IF THEY COULD NOT GET A
CONVICTION, WITH THE RODNEY
KING VIDEO AVAILABLE TO THE
JURORS, THAT THERE CAN
BE NO JUSTICE IN AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE].

VENT OUR FRUSTRATION.
ERIC "RICO" REED: YES.
CALLER 2: THIS IS WHAT
THEY EXPECT US TO DO.
ROBERT: I'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO KJLH ALL MY LIFE AND
I ONLY HAVE THREE WORDS
FOR, UH, WHAT'S HAPPENING,

WORDS THAT WAS UTTERED DURING
THE 1965 RIOTS.
ERIC "RICO" REED: AND YOU'RE
GONNA SAY THOSE BAD WORDS, HUH?
ROBERT: BURN, BABY, BURN.
ERIC "RICO" REED:
YEAH, THAT'S A...
DJ 2: THANK YOU, ROBERT.
MAN: I SAW IT ON TV.
WE COME DOWN HERE AND
IT'S JUST BLAZING.
REPORTER: AND THIS
IS YOUR AUNT'S STORE?
MAN: YES.
REPORTER: AND WAS IT
A LIQUOR STORE HERE OR?
MAN: NO, THIS WAS
A 99 CENT STORE.

THEY SAID IT ALL YESTERDAY
AND THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF IT.
AND THIS IS THE
OUTCOME OF THIS.
MAN: YOU ARE LISTENING
TO A SPECIAL NEWS REPORT
ON AM 1580, RADIO KOREA.
SOME NEWS JUST CAME IN, KFWB
RADIO HAS REPORTED THAT MORE
DAMAGE WAS DONE TO KOREAN
BUSINESSES THAN ANY OTHERS
DURING THE RIOTS.
THE REPORT SAYS THAT THE
REASON MAY BE THE CONFLICT
BETWEEN THE KOREAN
AND BLACK COMMUNITIES.
MAN: I DON'T BLAME ANY OTHER
PEOPLE, ANY OTHER RACE,
ANY OTHER COLORS.
JUST, IT HAPPENED.
IT HAPPENED.
THAT'S IT.
WE'RE GONNA BUILD HERE AGAIN.
WE WANT TO KEEP OUR
GOOD INTENTION, CONTINUES.
AND, UH, THAT'S IT.
WE, WE LIVE HERE AND
WE, WE WILL LIVE HERE
AND, UH, [SIGHS].
REPORTER: I UNDERSTAND.
REPORTER 2: THE CITY
IS STILL OFFICIALLY UNDER A
STATE OF EMERGENCY.
THE CITY COUNCIL IS GOING
TO MEET AND DISCUSS HOW TO
PROCEED FROM HERE.
JOHN FERRARO: THE PURPOSE OF
THIS MEETING IS TO DISCUSS THE
NECESSARY ACTION RELATIVE TO
THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE
CITY OF LOS ANGELES DECLARED
BY THE MAYOR ON APRIL 29TH.
OKAY, UH, MR. HOLDEN.
MR. HOLDEN: UH,
MR. PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS,
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD FROM
EACH OF MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE I
ARRIVED AND CERTAINLY YOU'VE
SEEN THEM ON TV ASKING FOR
CALM AND REGRETTING THE
TRAGEDY THAT TOOK PLACE LAST
NIGHT AND CONTINUING
IN OUR CITY.
THE QUESTION IS, UH,
HOW DO WE STOP IT?
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD
IDEA IT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR,
AND IT WILL UNLESS
WE HAVE A PRESENCE.
BUT YOU GOT TO START DEPLOYING
RIGHT NOW, I TELL YOU.
HANDWRITING'S ON THE WALL.
DJ: I CAN'T REALLY TELL
'CAUSE WE'RE ON THE RADIO AND
I CAN BARELY
SEE THE TELEVISION.
ARE PEOPLE STILL
LOOTING AT THIS TIME?
DJ 2: YES, THEY ARE.
I SEEN THEM WHEN
I WAS COMING IN TO WORK.
THEY'RE STILL GOING IN
TO STORES AND THEY'RE STILL
TAKING THINGS.
DJ: INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE.
DJ 2: AND LAUGHING.
MAN: MAN, GETTING STUFF,
MAN, GETTING STUFF.
GO IN THERE AND
FIND YOUR SIZE, MAN.
GETTING STUFF.
REPORTER: WHILE THE, THE
LOOTING SEEMS TO CONTINUE
UNABATED, UH, THE MOOD AT
LEAST, UH, SEEMS TO BE, UH,
VERY CALM TODAY.
LOOK AT RIGHT THROUGH THERE.
IT SAYS "FACTORY DIRECT SALE."
THIS IS THE BIGGEST SALE
THEY'VE PROBABLY EVER SEEN.
IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE
LOOTING ANYTHING THEY CAN
GET THEIR HANDS ON.
HERE'S A GUY WITH
A PLANT, EVEN,
COMING RIGHT OUT THE
FRONT WINDOW AND TAKING OFF.
MAN: I'VE BEEN TAKING
PICTURES OF ALL THIS.
THIS IS EXCITING.
IT'S WRONG, BUT IT'S EXCITING.
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
IT'S KIND OF ORDERLY.
IT'S KIND OF ORDERLY IN A WAY.
MAN 2: OH, EXCUSE ME.
MAN: I'M TELLING
YOU, IT'S, IT'S AMA,
LET ME GET THIS SHOT HERE.
IT'S AMAZING.
REPORTER 2:
WHERE ARE THE POLICE?
WHERE ARE ALL THE
POLICE THAT CHIEF GATES SAID
WOULD BE READY FOR THIS?
MAN: UH, CHIEF GATES?
DARYL GATES: UH, YES.
JUST TO, UH, EMPHASIZE,
UH, OUR DEPLOYMENT, UH,
WILL INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY
AND, UH, WE HOPE THAT THAT,
UH, WILL, UH,
SATISFY THE NEED.
BOB TUR: NOW, NOW
THERE ARE SOME POLICE,
NOW EVERYONE'S RUNNING.
HERE, HERE THE
POLICE ARE COMING.
LOOK AT THAT.
THERE MUST BE TWO OR
THREE DOZEN PEOPLE.
THEY'RE STILL COMING OUT
OF THAT STORE RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
FIT IN THAT STORE BUT THEY'RE
ALL RUNNING OUT
BECAUSE THERE'S THE POLICE
FINALLY MOVING IN.
THE POLICE CAN'T ARREST
THIS MANY PEOPLE.
THEY JUST GO RUNNING
WITH THEIR MERCHANDISE AND
THE POLICE REALLY AREN'T
RUNNING AFTER THEM.
THEY CAN'T RUN AFTER THEM.
POLICE OFFICER: WE JUST
DON'T ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO IT.
AS SOON AS WE CHASE THEM
AWAY, THEY COME RIGHT BACK.
TOM BRADLEY: IT'S MY JUDGMENT
THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY
OF THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN
THAT UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY NOW ARE
NOT THE LAW ABIDING
CITIZENS OF THIS COMMUNITY,
BUT THOSE WHO ARE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF AN OPPORTUNITY.
REPORTER: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WOMAN: I DON'T KNOW.
REPORTER:
ARE YOU EMBARRASSED?
DON'T YOU KNOW
THIS IS ILLEGAL?
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
MAN: I DON'T KNOW.
BECAUSE IT'S FREE.
REPORTER: 'CAUSE IT'S FREE?
MAN: YEAH.
REPORTER: DON'T YOU
KNOW IT'S WRONG?
MAN: NAH.
REPORTER: YOU DON'T CARE?
MAN: I DON'T CARE.
MAN 2: HONESTLY, WHAT IS
BEING DONE NOW IS NOT GOOD.
IF THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT HAD PAID KING
HIS RIGHTS, AS THE
CITIZEN THAT HE IS,
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY
WOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.
THE BLAME SHOULD BE
PUT ON THE GOVERNMENT.
REPORTER: WHERE ARE THE
NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS THAT
HAVE BEEN PROMISED?
WHY DO WE NOT SEE THEM?
DAN: BILL, WHY HASN'T
THE NATIONAL GUARD
BEEN CALLED OUT?
BILL: THAT'S A MYSTERY, DAN.
UH, WE HAVE, UH, HAD REPORTS
THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED ARE IN
THE AREA AND WE EXPECT TO
SEE AND HEAR FROM THEM SOON.
REPORTER: BUT I UNDERSTAND
THAT, UH, IDEA THAT, UH,
THEY COULD MAKE THINGS WORSE
BUT THEN YOU COULD SAY THAT
ABOUT THE POLICE TOO.
I MEAN, HOW MUCH WORSE
DOES IT NEED TO GET?

WOMAN: IT'S AT 84TH

CLOTHING STORE IN THERE?
YES, IS IT ON FIRE?
MAN 2: IT'S BURNING.
WOMAN: IS THERE ANY WAY FOR
A FIRE TRUCK TO GET THERE?
MAN: SO FAR, I DON'T SEE ANY.
MAYBE THE FIREFIGHTERS
ARE COVERING OTHER AREAS
AT THIS MOMENT?
WOMAN: WHAT CAN WE DO?
THAT'S OUR LIVELIHOOD!
DAVID JACKSON: WE HAVE
A FIRE THAT'S BROKEN OUT IN
KOREATOWN HERE
ACROSS WESTERN AVENUE.
PAT: HAVE THERE BEEN ANY KINDS
OF DISTURBANCES IN KOREATOWN?
I THINK THIS IS THE
FIRST WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS
KIND OF ACTIVITY.
DAVID JACKSON: YES,
THAT'S RIGHT, PAT.
THIS HAS JUST ERUPTED.
PAT: I DON'T SEE ANY OFFICIAL
FIREFIGHTERS, ANY ENGINES.
ARE THERE ANY IN THE AREA?
DAVID JACKSON: NO,
NO FIREFIGHTERS HERE.
MAN: THE BUSINESSES WHERE THE
OWNERS SHUT DOWN AND EVACUATED
GENERALLY SUFFERED EXTENSIVE
DAMAGE WHILE THOSE WHERE THE
OWNERS STAYED AND PROTECTED
THEIR SHOPS HAD ALMOST NONE.
DAVID KIM: YOU HAVE THE
RIGHT TO PROTECT YOURSELVES AND
YOUR BUSINESSES, AND
WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY,
YOU CAN ARM YOURSELVES.
THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY
GIVE YOU THAT RIGHT.
[HELICOPTER].
REPORTER: THEY'VE TAKEN
THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
POSITIONED THEMSELVES
ON THE ROOF.
THEY ARE AL-ALSO
ARMED WITH CLUBS.
THE KOREANS HERE HAVE
PREPARED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
AGAINST ANYTHING
THAT MAY COME THEIR WAY.
MAN: THE POLICE
DIDN'T COME HERE.
WE NEED, UH, ADDITIONAL
GUARD IN HERE.
WE HAVE NO POLICE
SUPPORT WHATSOEVER.
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING BY
SHOOTING AT US AND WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
REPORTER: WELL HE'S
DRESSED FOR WAR GAMES.
REPORTER 2: THAT'S RIGHT.
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A GAME
TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON
THE ROOF AND ARE CARRYING
RIFLES AND LOTS OF
BOXES OF AMMUNITION.
REPORTER: THAT'S FRIGHTENING.
REPORTER 3: IT CERTAINLY
IS A FRIGHTENING PICTURE.
MAN: THEY'RE SHOOTING AT US.
SO FAR WE'VE BEEN SHOOTING
UP BUT WHEN IT COMES THE
WORST WE'RE NOT GONNA SIT

HELICOPTER TO DESK.

OFFICER 2: IT WAS WORSE
THAN BEING IN VIETNAM.
AT LEAST IN VIETNAM
I COULD SHOOT BACK.
HERE WE COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING EXCEPT THERE'S PEOPLE
THROWING THINGS AT US.
ALL WE COULD DO WAS
STAND THERE AND TAKE IT.
WOMAN: ONLY WATCHING,

OFFICER: TAKE IT
DOWN THE STREET.

DAN: WERE YOU FRUSTRATED
TODAY BY THE APPARENT
RELUCTANCE OF THE
L.A. OFFICIALS TO USE THE
GUARD ON THE STREETS?
PETE WILSON: DAN, I DON'T
THINK THERE WAS RELUCTANCE.

SOME DELAY FOR LOGISTICAL
REASONS, REASONS THAT HAD TO
DO WITH EQUIPPING THE GUARD.

THE LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS IN
EQUIPPING THE GUARD WERE?
PETE WILSON: THE CHIEF
PROBLEM HAS BEEN WITH RESPECT
TO, UH, AMMUNITION.

CAN YOU FINISH THAT?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH AMMUNITION?
PETE WILSON: UH,
THE TROOPS CAME BUT THE
AMMUNITION DIDN'T.
THEY CAME WITH
SOME AMMUNITION,
NOT THE FULL COMPLEMENT
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE.
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT
IT WAS SLOW IN COMING
FROM CAMP ROBERTS.
NATIONAL GUARD: GONNA
START OUT FROM WHERE WE ARE
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAD

HEAD TO KILO'S POSITION AND
WEAPON'S COMPANY POSITION.

MR. RODNEY, TALK SOFTLY.

MAN: TEN SECONDS.
PRESIDENT BUSH:
TONIGHT, TONIGHT.
TONIGHT, TONIGHT, [HUMS].
TONIGHT I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT VIOLENCE IN
OUR CITIES AND JUSTICE
FOR OUR CITIZENS.
WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT AND
THE NIGHT BEFORE IN LOS ANGELES
IS NOT ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS.
IT'S NOT A MESSAGE OF PROTEST.
IT'S BEEN THE BRUTALITY
OF A MOB, PURE AND SIMPLE.
AND LET ME ASSURE YOU,
I WILL USE WHATEVER FORCE IS
NECESSARY TO RESTORE ORDER.
WITHIN ONE HOUR
OF THE VERDICT,
I DIRECTED THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT TO MOVE INTO HIGH
GEAR ON ITS OWN
INDEPENDENT CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION INTO THE CASE.
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT OUR
SYSTEM OF JUSTICE PROVIDES FOR
THE PEACEFUL, ORDERLY MEANS
OF ADDRESSING THIS FRUSTRATION.
WE MUST RESPECT
THE PROCESS OF LAW,
WHETHER OR NOT WE
AGREE WITH THE OUTCOME.
IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY
THERE CAN BE NO EXCUSE,
NO EXCUSE FOR THE
MURDER, ARSON,
THEFT AND VANDALISM
THAT HAVE TERRORIZED THE
LAW ABIDING CITIZENS
OF LOS ANGELES.
NONE OF THIS IS WHAT WE
WISH TO THINK OF AS AMERICAN.
IT'S AS IF WE WERE LOOKING
IN A MIRROR THAT DISTORTED
OUR BETTER SELVES AND
TURNED US UGLY.
WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN.
WE CANNOT DO THAT
TO OURSELVES.
IF WE ARE TO REMAIN THE
MOST VIBRANT AND HOPEFUL
NATION ON EARTH,
WE MUST ALLOW OUR DIVERSITY
TO BRING US TOGETHER,
NOT DRIVE US APART.
THE VIOLENCE WILL END,
JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED.
HOPE WILL RETURN.
THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
REPORTER: PRESIDENT GEORGE
BUSH AND HIS ADDRESS TO THE
NATION FROM THE OVAL OFFICE.
TIME FOR YOUR REACTIONS ONCE
AGAIN FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY.
FT. WASHINGTON, MARYLAND.
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
CALLER: FIRST OF ALL,
MR. BUSH SPOKE OF THE LAST
48 HOURS AS IF IT'S THE
FIRST TIME HE'S NOTICED
THAT AMERICA HAS A PROBLEM.
UH, IT'S ALWAYS HAD A
PROBLEM FROM ITS INCEPTION
FROM 1776 WHEN THEY SAID,
UH, ALL MEN WERE CREATED
EQUAL AND WE HAD SLAVERY.
CALLER 2: IT WAS STRIKING TO
ME THAT THERE WAS NO DIRECT
STATEMENT TO THE AFRICAN
AMERICAN POPULATION AND THERE
WAS COMPLETELY MISSING ANY
SENSE OF A REALITY ABOUT HOW A
NATIONAL LEADER MIGHT MOVE
PEOPLE TOWARDS RECONCILIATION.
CALLER 3: PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE
THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD.
IF THEY ALLOW, WHEN
THEY HEAR A POLITICIAN,
TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS AWAY
AS BEING THUGS AND MURDERERS,
THINGS WILL NOT CHANGE.
THIS HAS GOT TO BE
A PEOPLE MOVEMENT.
UH, PEOPLE CAN
MOVE POLITICIANS.
THE COMMUNITY LEADS.
THEY DON'T FOLLOW.
POLITICIANS FOLLOW.
THEY DON'T LEAD.
AND THAT'S WHAT WE
HAVE TO REMEMBER.
[HORN HONKING].
[CHANTING "STOP THE VIOLENCE"]
MAN: WE ARE GOING TO
SHOW THEM THAT HERE,
THE LATINO REALLY WANTS
TO SUPPORT THIS CITY.
WE NEED THEM TO BRING
JUST BROOMS AND GLOVES,
AND THE CHILDREN, AND THEIR
ENTIRE FAMILY WILL BEGIN TO
CLEAN THE WHOLE CITY.
CROWD: STOP THE VIOLENCE,
STOP THE VIOLENCE.
WOMAN: YOU KNOW, IT'S
IMPORTANT TO SEE THE FULL
SCOPE; THE BURNING, THE
LOOTING, AND THE CLEANING UP.
A PERSONAL OPINION IS
JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO WORK
TOGETHER AND IF THIS CAN JUST
CONTINUE IT'D BE WONDERFUL.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK IT WILL.
I THINK, YOU KNOW, A
FEW PEOPLE SAY OKAY,
I PUT IN MY TIME.
I HELPED CLEAN.
AND THEY'RE NOT
GONNA DO ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW, PROVE ME WRONG.
YOU KNOW, OH GOD,
PROVE ME WRONG.
YOU KNOW?
MAN: ALRIGHT, WE HAD ENOUGH,
THAT'S RIGHT, FOR PEACE.
[HORN HONKING].
WOMAN: THAT'S RIGHT.
HONK FOR PEACE,
HONK FOR PEACE.
REPORTER: I WAS DRIVING
DOWN WESTERN BELOW WILSHIRE AND
I LOOKED TO THE LEFT
AND SAW A SEA OF PEOPLE.
THESE ARE KOREAN-AMERICANS
WHO GATHERED TODAY TO
CALL FOR PEACE.
MAN: THIS IS OUR CITY AND
MUST NOT DESTROY OUR OWN HOMES.
TO STAND UNITED TO
STOP ANY FURTHER SENSELESS
VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION.
REPORTER: MOST OF THEM ARE
WEARING WHITE HEADBANDS.
THEY SAY THAT IS
A SYMBOL OF PEACE.
THE ONE SIGN THOUGH THAT
STOOD OUT IN MY MIND THE MOST
WAS A SIGN THAT SAID,
"WE KNOW IT WAS INJUSTICE.
WE KNOW IT WAS INJUSTICE."
MAN: WE STAND TOGETHER
WITH ALL THOSE WHO WANT
JUSTICE IN THE KING CASE.
WE MUST STOP POLICE
ABUSE WHEREVER IT OCCURS.
CROWD: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
PEACE.
WHEN DO WE WANT IT?
NOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
PEACE.
WHEN DO YOU WANT IT?
NOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
[INAUDIBLE CHANTING]
WOMAN: THROUGHOUT HISTORY,
THE ONLY POWER I BELIEVE THAT
THE POWER POOR PEOPLE HAVE AND
POWERLESS PEOPLE HAVE IN THIS
COUNTRY COMES FROM OUR UNRULY
BEHAVIOR, OUR, OUR, OUR RE,
OUR RESISTANCE TO AN
ORDER THAT WOULD PLACE US
AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE TOTEM POLE.
CROWD CHANTING: WE WANT
JUSTICE, WE WANT PEACE.
WE WANT JUSTICE,
WE WANT PEACE.
WE WANT JUSTICE,
WE WANT PEACE.

REPORTER: THIS
IS WHERE IT BEGAN.
THIS IS WHERE THE
FUSE WAS LIGHTED.
IT BEGAN WITH THE ARREST
BY WHITE OFFICERS OF THE
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL
OF TWO YOUNG NEGROS,
ONE ON A CHARGE
OF DRUNK DRIVING.
THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT.
THERE WAS A SCUFFLE.
THE STORY OF POLICE
BRUTALITY QUICKLY SPREAD
THROUGH THE COMMUNITY.
UP THE STREET A BLOCK
OR SO IN THAT DIRECTION,
A CHURCH WHERE NEGRO
LEADERS PLEADED FOR PEACE
AND WERE REJECTED.
DOWN THAT WAY, THE BUSY
INTERSECTION WHERE CARS WERE
OVERTURNED AND BURNED,
WHERE OTHER CARS WERE STONED,
WHERE A TELEVISION TECHNICIAN
WAS PULLED FROM HIS WAGON AND
ALMOST BEATEN TO DEATH.
JOHN SHABAZ: WHAT HAS CHANGED?
THE ONLY THING THAT WE'VE DONE
WAS THAT MASSIVE FORCES WERE
BROUGHT IN TO SUPPRESS
THE ACTUAL OVERT ACTION.
RAMONA RIPSTON: THE INCIDENT
IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.
THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME
IS THAT WE HAVE THE PROOF.
[YELLING INAUDIBLY].
WOMAN: YOU'RE GUILTY,
YOU'RE GUILTY.
MAN: EVERY TIME SOMEBODY
TALK ABOUT PEACE WE GET
A FOOT IN OUR ASS.
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT PEACE NO MORE.
[YELLING INAUDIBLY].
PRESIDENT BUSH: IN A
CIVILIZED SOCIETY THERE CAN BE
NO EXCUSE FOR THE.
CHIEF PARKER: MURDER,
PILLAGE, LOOTING,
AND ARSON HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH CIVIL RIGHTS.
MAN 2: "GET OUT OF
THE CAR, NIGGER.
ASSUME THE POSITION, NIGGER.
SIT ON THE CURB, NIGGER.
LIE FACE DOWN ON
THE GROUND, NIGGER."
MAN 3: WHY SHOULD
NOT WE GET RESTLESS?
MAN 4: I DON'T THINK
IT'D EVER STOP, REALLY.
I MEAN, IT MAY NOT BE LIKE
THIS, BUT IT'LL NEVER STOP.
WOMAN 2: THIS IS NOT
FAIR, THIS IS NOT FAIR,
THIS IS NOT FAIR,
THIS IS NOT FAIR.
MAN 5: THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HELP.
WOMAN 2: THIS IS NOT
FAIR, THIS IS NOT FAIR,
THIS IS NOT FAIR,
THIS IS NOT FAIR.
BILL STOUT: A CRISIS
IN OUR COUNTRY SAYS
THE MCCONE COMMISSION.
SO SERIOUS AND EXPLOSIVE IS
THE SITUATION THAT UNLESS IT
IS CHECKED, THE AUGUST RIOTS
MAY BE ONLY A CURTAIN RAISER
TO WHAT COULD BLOW UP
ONE DAY IN THE FUTURE.
WHAT SHALL IT AVAIL OUR
NATION IF WE CAN PLACE A MAN
ON THE MOON BUT CANNOT CURE
THE SICKNESS IN OUR CITIES?
THIS IS BILL STOUT FOR
CBS REPORTS IN LOS ANGELES.
GOOD NIGHT.
