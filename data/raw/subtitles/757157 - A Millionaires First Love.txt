How's your head?
Jae-kyung!
I'm rich.
You know that, right?
As of last midnight I'm richer.
I can pay my way out of this.
Watch it, asshole.
It's done.
What took you so long?
This isn't the first time.
There's a matter to discuss.
I'm the heir, okay?
Study hard and be sure to get your diploma.
Teacher, drop me a line anytime.
You!
What are you doing?
Don't call me in class!
Todays his 18th birthday.
He's an official millionaire
due to the inheritance.
- To KANG Jae-kyung!
- Cheers!
I'm so envious.
Why is my old man so healthy?
Starring / HYUN Bin
LEE Yeon-hee
JUNG Wook
SHIN Jung-lim?
Do I know you?
Here to see my son?
He skipped school again?
That bastard!
Did he knock you up?
I can't believe this!
Why didn't you use protection?
You should've known better.
I have no money to spare. So leave!
Directed by KIM Tae-gyun
This is a five-star hotel.
So what?
Forget about hooking here.
Don't worry about that.
I'm pregnant.
- What?
- Any motels around here?
This place is too expensive.
What a nutcase!
Consider yourself lucky.
I'm in a good mood.
Not in my hotel, okay?
A Millionaire's First Love
Honey.
- What are you doing here?
- To sleep with you.
You're so simple.
The number to open the door
is your DOB.
Sorry for being simple.
You have 3 seconds to leave.
- Come on, Honey.
- Get off me!
What's that!
- It's not what you think.
- Okay.
- It really isn't.
- Okay.
Fuck me.
Oh God!
Shit!
Hey!
What's your problem?
Why are you still here?
- To see you.
- What?
The picture in the ladies room
is lopsided. Go fix it.
Oh!
Here's your tip.
- Is this how you run the hotel?
- I'll fix it right away.
No, that hooker!
Damn!
There's a matter to discuss.
What the hell is it?
This will is in effect only when
the heir meets the requirement.
- It's as follows.
- You kidding me?
Is this a joke?
I turned 18 yesterday!
The heir should transfer
to Boram High School
in Gangwondo.
Get off my back, will you?
And he must graduate.
The estate goes to the charity
if he drops out.
However, if he resigns his right
hell inherit only 0.1%.
Forget it.
You're fired.
You're transferring.
And remember.
You have no right to fire me.
Does it tell you to fuck
with me?
Does it?
What's this?
Why are you doing this?
Fine. I'll do it.
You'll be very sorry.
See what I do with your money.
Get the car ready.
You can't use it.
What?
Not only the car
but this penthouse and cottage.
You can't use anything that
belonged to him.
Didn't I fire you?
Get your pension and leave.
Get the car ready.
What?
You wanna lose your job, too?
Here's the address.
If you need help, call me.
What a shitty house.
Hasn't he grown!
What?
It needs a little trimming.
Who the hell are you?
Why bother gardening?
Nobody lives here.
You're here now.
Forget it.
I don't need a gardener.
Goddamn boondocks!
Fix the door.
I will.
Let me finish this first.
Fix it now, okay?
What a grandson he had.
So rebellious.
Bye.
This towns got poor taste.
And a pack of cigarettes.
No cigarettes.
- What?
- No cigarettes for students.
What are you taking...
You!
Did you fix that picture?
It's $15.80
You live here?
Hand it nicely next time.
This card is suspended.
Read what it says on it.
Platinum Card.
But it's not good.
I can't believe this.
You know how much I have
in my account?
I don't even know. Why?
It increases by the day.
Get that?
I couldn't care less.
Why don't you pay in cash?
Your hands are filthy.
Keep the change.
Why dyeing your fingernails
with flower juice?
They're black-edged.
I can't wait for the first snow.
What's the point?
You've never been in love.
I'm 19.
I've been in love.
It may come earlier for you
Eun-whan.
God, it's noisy.
Shut up, please!
Hometown of your heart.
Hometown of your heart.
How corny!
- What do you want?
- I was worried about you.
You'd better start
worrying about yourself.
- Why would I...
- You'll be fired soon.
Mr. Lawyer, the will says
no dropping-out.
So getting expelled is okay.
You're all over the place.
Where's the principal?
He's getting the toolbox
in his office.
No, I'm looking for...
I'm glad you're all here.
Meet each other.
Who's my HR teacher?
That's me. I teach the seniors.
So nice to have you.
I have the script for you.
It's a musical.
We need to practice hard.
- No Lit class.
- Why?
The teachers cow is giving birth.
- Is he from Seoul?
- Coming to school this late?
He showed up with style.
He's a transferee from Seoul.
Introduce yourself and take a seat.
Sit here.
God, look at these clowns.
He looked at you.
Ask his name.
That bulky one, can he fight?
His name is Myung-sik.
Very strong.
He can crush you if he wants to.
Don't mess with him.
What's up with her accent?
I'm just saying that he's so strong
that you don't wanna...
Save it.
Make sure you keep it on.
- It looks good on me?
- Like a crazy bitch!
He's so senseless.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
See me outside.
What's up with him?
I can't believe this.
He singled him out.
Yeah? How could he?
We shouldn't stand this.
You should've told me
where you would be.
I looked all over for you.
You could've guessed
it was here.
I thought it was the cafeteria.
Whatever. Let's do it.
What? Do what?
Cleaning here?
Shit!
What are you doing here?
What about you?
Why only Myung-sik?
Don't wanna be friends with us?
What do you like about him?
Listen. I'm sorry.
I know I'm a bad ass.
But I've never done this before.
- Wanna take the first punch?
- What? Punch you?
What for?
Fine then.
Let me.
You did this to him?
You beat the crab out of him
and rearranged his face?
- Yes.
- Why?
- What'd he do to you?
- No, nothing.
Take him to a hospital.
And complain to the school.
Can I go now?
What are you doing?
You're so slow!
Go ahead.
That's how boys grow up.
When the wound heals
your mind ripens.
Listen, Myung-sik.
Don't try to get back at him.
If you do, I'll kill you.
Okay?
You know I'm not like that.
Come on, eat.
You live alone, right?
You want some to go?
No. I'll eat.
It's very dark.
Be careful.
What a town!
What are they, angels?
Be a man, Jae-kyung.
Be a man, Jae-kyung.
I'm a man. I'm a man.
What's this?
- What are you scared of?
- No, I'm not.
You scare me.
It's scary to run into an ugly girl
like you at night.
Turn it off.
Your girlfriend is shivering.
It's chilly.
What girlfriend?
Hey. Hey!
- Pretty, isn't it?
- Are you crazy?
No, but sick.
Damn.
This crazy bitch is leaving.
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
That bitch!
Hey!
Hey!
- Holy shit! Play the way it should be!
- It should be.
Gather around!
You! What are you doing there?
Stage Design, Costume/ Sung-hee
Col. Von Trapp/ Ku-ho
Only one character left.
The maid.
Good.
You got it, Jae-kyung.
What?
I got what?
- The maid.
- The maid? What's that?
We have to stage a play
to graduate.
Says who?
That's bullshit.
What's wrong with this school?
I'll report it
to the Ministry of Education.
It's a part of curriculum.
Everybody has to do it.
You have no choice.
What do you take me for
a freaking kindergartner?
For the orphanage?
No way that I'm doing it.
Count me out.
He's cute but mean.
This will be over tomorrow.
- I know you like it.
- You are broken.
- We'll, I'm rich.
- Is that so?
What happened?
What took you so long
answering the phone?
Where are you?
I've been trying to reach you.
Is it Jae-kyung?
Give it here.
- Let me talk to him.
- Where the hell are you?
- Where is he?
- Don't ask. Send me some money.
- You're asking me for money?
- I told you not to ask.
Taking part in the famine
or something?
- I'll message you the address.
- Jae-kyung!
It's embarrassing.
This is freaking embarrassing.
It's embarrassing!
It's embarrassing!
God, it's embarrassing!
Grandpa.
I know what you're up to.
But it won't work.
I'll put an end to this.
God, it's embarrassing.
This should be enough.
What's this?
Let me graduate.
I won't come to classes.
What does that have to do
with this money?
Isn't he greedy!
How about now?
A teachers ability is a belief
that he can change people.
By Ralph Emerson.
I know I won't change.
No big deal.
You wanna take a shortcut?
No, you do it fair and square.
Even if it takes longer!
Okay?
That temper must run
in the family.
You left way too early.
Honey!
Jae-kyung!
Honey, you're so inconsiderate!
I missed you so much!
- Keep missing me.
- Honey, you're building a school?
- Let's go hit the booze.
- Sounds good.
They're kick-ass cars!
That tramp is a work of
plastic surgery.
- Are you trying to punk us?
- What a place, man.
- Hi, what can I get you?
- Get us whatever you want.
You guys are so cool.
What are you doing
in these boondocks?
We were worried.
- Are you senile?
- What?
Don't ask any questions.
Forgot that?
God, I can't believe this.
Honey, are we drinking here?
I don't want to.
If you honey me again
I'll make you work here.
Buy one for me, too.
It's launching, not lunch.
I gotta have it
before everybody else does.
Why ask abut Jae-kyung?
He's my man!
What the... I'll call you back.
Shit!
Which one?
Can you pop the lid?
Let me help you.
It's so heavy.
It's $35
including the delivery.
Here.
Keep the change.
Ours is the only station
in town.
Come get gas for the rest
of the change.
This is all I have on me.
Why always you?
You know her?
Wait.
Where are you going?
I tipped you for some service.
Empty the ashtray.
You smoked. You empty it.
What are you doing?
Get out of here.
The organic form has changed
due to geographical
and environmental changes
over a long period of time.
Is Jae-kyung absent?
Again?
It's called an ecological
succession.
All living things are...
Eunhye Orphanage
Mom.
I'm not.
- You sure?
- Yes.
- Be a good boy.
- Okay.
- That makes you a gentleman
- Yes.
Dad.
Mom, I'm here.
Don't leave me, Mom. I'm here!
Dad, don't go!
Mom! Dad!
Don't go! I'm here!
Mom! Dad, don't go!
Mom, don't go! I'm here!
Dad! Mom I'm Jae-kyung
Jae-kyung!
KANG Jae-kyung?
Jae-kyung?
KANG Jae-kyung?
If you keep missing...
Mom...
Jae-kyung!
KANG Jae-kyung!
What are you doing?
It'll be over before you know it.
It won't hurt.
Isn't this too big?
You have an upset stomach.
It'll help digest.
You're hurting me, asshole!
Don't hold him too tightly.
Don't do it. Let go!
Come on, be a man.
It doesn't hurt that much.
Don't touch me!
That scared?
Close your eyes then.
Let go, or I'll kill you!
Look, the blood is so...
So red.
Sleep some more.
Don't kick the blanket.
Get back here.
You're dead meat.
Sleep. Go back to bed.
Hey!
I told you
it wasn't the upset stomach.
So weird, it seems
like a stomachache.
You scared me.
Feel better now?
I'm making potato balls.
Why staring at me like that?
- Never seen it before.
- What?
A girl cooking.
It's boiling over.
You like it?
I have a question.
Is there a way to graduate
without doing the play?
- No.
- Make one then.
You don't wanna do it
to help the orphanage?
I don't.
I've helped enough, but...
Forget it.
Your lawyer said,
don't let him graduate without effort.
One, two, three, four, five
six, seven, eight
Why can't you do it right?
Myung-sik, look forward.
Keep your arms up high.
Feel the music and move gracefully.
Hey, hold your ass in. Turn!
You hurt your leg?
What happened?
It just happened.
I don't think I can do the play.
Asshole!
You selfish son of a bitch.
What?
What the hell!
Eun-whan!
- Eun-whan!
- What's wrong?
She must have an upset stomach.
Needle her finger.
Eun-whan!
Eun-whan, are you okay?
Open your eyes.
Eun-whan!
Hey!
- Eun-whan! Eun-whan!
- Eun-whan! Eun-whan!
- Eun-whan! Eun-whan!
- Eun-whan! Eun-whan!
You can't force me.
The choice mine.
Eun-whan!
I don't wanna die here.
You can't be stubborn about this.
It's my life. Why can't I?
Yeah, I made it!
Let me live
until the first snow comes.
I've dyed my fingernails with flower juice.
No visitor is allowed.
- Is it that bad?
- We can't see her then?
Just our luck!
Hey, it's a market day!
Please!
- Don't you have to buy props?
- I don't know.
Isn't that Jae-kyung?
It's something, huh?
Never seen this in Seoul?
We have TVs in Seoul.
Look at that!
Must be a new stock!
Buy some.
They're top quality.
Yeah?
All she has is fake stuff.
Oh, you bought it from me.
That's good.
It's the same as mine.
- You know how much this is?
- Of course.
$10 for 3.
That's what you paid.
You said to buy us lunch.
Can you buy me this instead?
- You sure?
- Yes.
Me too!
I know you're loaded.
I want lunch!
Lunch!
- Here.
- Nice!
- Buy yourself lunch.
- You're so beautiful.
You're cool!
It's a weird town.
A ten-dollar-bill can
make everybody so happy.
Did you make these?
If not me, did you?
I know you're faking it.
Get out of the hospital.
Your leg is fine.
What's wrong with you?
You couldn't send me a message
if you were okay or not.
How could you collapse
from overwork?
Quit working at the station.
They're nice.
Don't be mistaken.
I didn't weave them.
Pretty.
You could've thanked me.
- You'll quit working, right?
- I don't know. I'll see.
Hi.
Choppy Chop!
Hey.
Pull in and up.
What is this, a circus?
Why can't we just do the lines?
Hey! Put me down!
What are you doing? Let go!
Hey! Why!
Hold on. Wait.
I'll do it.
I'll do it, okay?
- Lift them.
- Why!
One, two, three!
Breathe, Breathe.
- One more time.
- One more time.
Stop it. Please, don't!
One, two, three!
You're supposed to pick them
not eat them!
The suns going down soon.
You're awfully slow.
Pick it up, will you?
Why should I do this?
Staging the play is no joke.
It costs a lot.
Get the principal!
This is exploitation of labor.
I'll report him to the police!
Shut up and work.
We need to get paid.
Shut up!
I'm not eating it.
Here, I picked it.
I can't believe him.
Thanks.
All right!
Thanks.
This is it?
$30 is more than enough
for what you did.
What, $30?
I'm KANG Jae-kyung.
In my account, I have...
So what?
It's not your money, is it?
You have a long way to go.
Listen to yourself.
You don't even have $3 on you.
You're pathetic.
I don't care who you are.
Get real!
That pretty?
- What?
- You can't take your eyes off my face.
I wasn't looking at you
because you're pretty.
Your hair smells like shit.
I can't even breathe.
- Be careful driving home.
- Okay.
See you later.
Not going home?
What are you doing here?
I'm the head of this orphanage.
What?
You shouldn't be out for long.
Dad, don't be a nag.
Come in. Eat with us.
Dad?
It's okay. I know how you feel.
- How do I feel?
- You're sorry for me.
They feel sorry when they learn
that I'm an orphan.
Thanks for taking me home.
Hey!
I don't feel sorry for you.
I don't have parents, either.
My daddy is getting married.
- To whom?
- Mrs. Shredder.
- You sure?
- Of course. Daddy said so earlier.
Look. No dialect, okay?
Let's take a break.
We can't.
Eun-whan will be upset.
We should practice songs, too.
Songs?
All right.
Let the start at the very beginning
Your pronunciation sucks!
No, it doesn't.
You try it then.
You're a big boy
but act like a baby.
Where's Eun-whan anyway?
Must be working.
You know she's into money.
I feel sorry for her.
She works after school
cooks, and cleans for us.
Why don't you get a job, too
and help her out then?
If you're done...
What?
Why can't I go in?
Only the family is allowed!
- Behave!
- Get out of my way!
Calm down.
What are you doing?
It's hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
And her heart is very unstable.
It can kill her any moment.
You said it was due to overworking
when she was here before.
I didn't expect it to get worse this fast.
I don't believe you.
Do it again.
Do all the tests over.
You call yourself a doctor?
You're only a quack!
What are you doing here?
You woke up?
You're drooling.
What man would marry you?
What are you doing here?
- On behalf of flowers.
- What?
I wanted to get flowers
but they said no.
So here I am.
Am I not pretty?
I smell pretty good, too.
- You know what's wrong with me?
- Yes, anemia.
The doc says you'll be fine
if you eat well.
So, you'd better eat well.
This is nice.
Let her live.
Let my Eun-whan live.
Please.
I'm rich. Try everything. I'll pay.
What about a transplant?
It's too late.
Come on, Eun-whan is...
Shes only 19.
I haven't even told her
that I like her.
She can't afford to be upset or surprised.
And love can kill her.
If she gets too happy or excited
her heart could stop.
No. No way.
That's bullshit!
Not again!
I can't believe this.
My son says
that he doesn't know you.
Whatever you're trying to pull
forget it.
I...
What, you need money?
For an abortion?
I live from hand to mouth.
Why don't you...
Recognize me.
We have the same eyes.
And same lips.
I could tell.
I hadn't seen you for 19 years
but I recognized you.
How could you not?
Oh God...
I hated you so much.
Growing up without you
I thought I'd make you pay.
I thought I'd hurt you and make you sorry.
But I ended up hurting myself.
My baby...
I'll forgive you for dumping me.
Forgive me for hating you.
Because I...
I'd like to go to heaven.
You ran from the hospital.
You're so bad.
- Should I go back to the hospital?
- Forget it, I...
What about you?
You have no idea.
Why would I not know?
I like you so much.
You made me worry to death.
Right?
You missed one.
I'd like to keep you by my side all day.
Can't you stop working?
No, I have to make money.
I'm putting aside money.
What for?
To get married?
- I wanna buy a house.
- A house?
There's this house with many windows.
Very pretty.
I'd be so happy
living in a house like that.
Don't worry about it.
I'll buy you a better house.
I'm talking about the house
where I live now.
I always imagine that.
Why don't you quit working and imagine?
- Imagining doesn't cost anything.
- Yes, it does.
The land owner wants us out.
Are you a lawyer, or a swindler?
What are you doing here?
Eunhye Orphanage!
It's grandpas land.
You told them to move out
didn't you?
Your grandpa is dead.
So I guess I did.
Son of a bitch!
They've occupied that
land illegally.
And they've never paid rent
while your grandfather was alive.
It's mine in a few months.
You think you'll get away with this?
Who knows what could happen?
You're graduating in 5 months.
What the hell!
There's a way.
What's that?
Give up the inheritance.
How can you do this to me? No.
How can you do this to my grandfather?
If you do, you'll receive 0.1%
of the inheritance in cash.
Some people will be happy
to get you out of the way.
If you wanna buy that land
with that money.
I'll be happy to help you.
Tired?
I told you not to do it.
No, I'm not tired.
- Did you and Jae-kyung fight?
- No, it's the opposite.
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy that I think
I'm going to hell.
What are you talking about?
I'll end up hurting him.
Knowing that, I miss him.
I wanna hold his hands.
And be with him.
What makes me happy now
will hurt him later.
But I can't help it.
I'll definitely go to hell.
Is God blind?
Doesn't he have a conscience?
Dad!
Don't be afraid to be happy.
He's taking you from me.
He'll understand.
Give me her medicine.
I'll keep her by my side
and take care of her.
Here's the money.
- But she's...
- I know.
Either happiness or sadness will kill her.
She might die any moment.
That is why.
Why won't you listen?
You're the risk to her.
You can't do this
just to make yourself happy.
It's not for my own sake.
How happy could I be
with a dying girl?
But even if I stay away
she will die.
What if she leaves when I'm not there?
Give me her medicine.
I've been waiting for you.
I've come to live with you.
Your dad is waiting. Go.
I got his permission.
He trusts me.
He told me to have fun.
Are you nuts?
You want to move in with me?
I'm hungry. Let's eat.
Get out of here.
I don't wanna be with you.
You said that you liked me
and you wanted to be with me.
I was caught up in the moment.
Jerk!
Is it that easy for you?
Love is that easy?
Damn!
You got a hearing problem?
Didn't you hear me?
Get out of here!
You give me a big headache.
My head is about to explode.
I must've been blinded
stuck out here.
I'm not here to date.
So leave before I make you!
How much is 0.1%?
Isn't this too early to talk?
How much do I get
if I give up my inheritance?
Are you?
- A verbal agreement is also...
- I know. How much is it?
It's a little shy of what costs
to buy the orphanage.
Leave the orphanage alone.
I'll give it up.
I won't eat my words.
Get the paper work done.
That's your specialty.
Are you sure
you won't regret it?
Won't I regret it?
I know I will, after this call.
Bye.
I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.
But this girl is more important
than 99.9% of my inheritance
that I'm throwing away.
Hi.
What's wrong with your face?
Hey.
Hey, stop running around.
Let's practice.
- Where's Eun-whan?
- Eun-whan?
She was in a bad mood.
She went out for a stroll.
Let's do a new scene.
I'll come back.
Don't go.
I'll be back after 10 nights.
I promise.
You mean it?
- Who wrote this?
- Yes
Eun-whan adapted it from a book.
Please, come back.
This isn't any good.
Gather around.
Try to bring up more emotions.
- I'll come back, Eun-whan.
- Don't go.
I'll be back after 10 nights.
I promise.
- You mean it?
- Yes.
Mom! Mom!
- Where's Eun-whan?
- She didn't show up.
Eun-whan.
I... I came back too late.
I don't care anymore.
You don't have to do the play.
I'll come back. Eun-whan.
10 nights. After 10 nights.
Jae-kyung.
I meant it when I said 10 nights.
But that day...
I lost my parents.
So I couldn't.
I didn't want to.
I erased all the memories
about you and this place.
It was too painful.
I'm sorry.
Times running out on us.
I came back too late.
I hope to stay with you
until the first snow.
So I can wear those socks
that you bought me.
But I will die before that, because of you.
I know it hurts for you to be with me.
But I love you.
Look at me.
You like the room?
- No.
- Why not?
I thought wed share the room.
I'm going home.
If you're kidding, I'll kill...
The pillow is too high.
I don't like it.
How about now?
It's better.
Is your head made of stone?
It's so heavy. My arm hurts.
It's just the beginning.
It'll hurt more later.
You'll hurt more than me.
I wish.
I wish I'd hurt for you.
Won't you regret it?
I get that a lot lately.
Okay, we'll see.
Let me sleep some.
Your arm will go to sleep.
I didn't think
you'd let me do this.
Trying to seek out a favor?
Not with you, with God.
So he'll take his time
taking you from me.
- If anybody sees this...
- They'll call me a sissy?
I don't care.
Not embarrassed?
This will bring me love.
Why would I be?
Dye my toenails, too.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?
Why didn't you tell me
that it was you?
How could I?
You didn't recognize me.
Hi, I'm Eun-whan.
How have you been?
I'm here to say goodbye. See?
Hold on a sec!
- Remember this?
- You told me.
If you blow it, your wish will come true.
You do remember.
What are you wishing for?
For you to grow up.
Don't take me suddenly.
Give me enough time
to say goodbye.
It's done.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Delete it!
So cute.
Don't!
Move your hands.
What are you doing?
- What the...
- Just one picture.
Come on, you look so pretty.
Just one picture. Stop!
Just one picture
1, 2, 3!
Where's the maid?
Wait and see.
Colonel has the baton.
The nun is fine.
Our kids look great.
Don't push me!
So does the maid.
I said I didn't wanna do this!
Your fingernails!
- Won't you cut it up?
- No, Colonel. Anything else you need?
- That maid has an attitude.
- Tell me about it.
You're supposed to cut it up
for him.
- Shove it in your mouth.
- Not too much adlib.
- What's adlib?
- Come on!
Don't know?
His head is good for nothing.
You alright?
Hey! Why sit there?
That's for the teacher.
I take better pictures
when I'm seated.
Seated or standing
it's the same you.
Get up.
Okay, let's take it.
You wanted me next to you, didn't you?
Shut up.
Look here.
Stand closer.
Here we go.
Cheese!
Eun-whan, what's wrong?
Are you in pain?
I'm fine. I'm just taking a shower.
Open the door.
Open it.
Or I'll break it.
Open it now.
Leave me alone.
I'll break it, okay?
Eun-whan!
Eun-whan!
Eun-whan, stay with me.
Fool. If it hurts, scream.
Hold me and cry.
Don't try to hide it.
It hurts me so much.
I feel as if I'd die before you!
I'm scared, Jae-kyung.
I'm so scared.
Let me live.
How...
How could I...
My heart... It's broken.
Because I love you enough
for my heart to burn.
Medicine doesn't work anymore.
It's hot. So hot.
How...
Eun-whan, please.
Eun-whan!
Eun-whan!
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.
Open them.
It's for your birthday.
I couldn't wait.
You made all these?
Sure. I'm such a family man.
Here.
- What's this?
- A birthday present.
Don't be sick anymore.
That cures everything.
Everybody in Seoul knows it.
One a day, okay?
Don't overdose it.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Wondering why I like you
I miss you. It's a disease.
It's raining.
The rain can't cool down
my love for you.
If he stakes out a house for an hour
he's called a stalker.
And I did that for two.
Come on, don't follow me
into my dreams.
When I'm with you at night
it feels as if it were day.
Now I believe that phrase
that you can see with eyes closed.
Fool. I told you not to overdose on it.
I was afraid.
Afraid that I might die
before reading all these.
Move this chair.
Thanks for this.
No, if I had known...
Go see Eun-whan.
Why are you...?
I can't let you hold
some other boys hands.
You're gonna ruin it?
You don't know the lines by heart.
Will you stay with us?
Until you find another tutor.
Will you put these on me?
- Do I have to do this?
- Of course.
Thank you for taking your time
to be here tonight.
It's such a noble love story.
Enjoy Sound of Music.
That's my grandson!
Attention. At ease.
Sit.
I said sit, Maria.
Oh!
How did you know my name is Maria?
Beats me, Maria.
Eun-whan?
Eun-whan? CHOI Eun-whan!
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
- Let's stop it.
- No, I can do this.
When you were little
did a boy kiss you?
I don't know.
Do you know
why they close their eyes
when kissing?
Because they're so dazzled
by each other.
In that short moment
with my eyes closed...
I'll miss you.
Since when?
What?
That you love me.
Since the moment I saw you.
I'm sorry that I couldn't do
anything for you.
Fool. You've brought me happiness.
I'm sleepy.
Let me sleep some.
For 3 minutes.
- Eun-whan
- Yeah
I love you.
Eun-whan, it's the first snow.
Sleep for 3 minutes.
Only for 3 minutes.
Now a testimonial will be presented.
Award of Friendship for CHOI Eun-whan.
Award of Friendship.
CHOI Eun-whan.
Whether sad, happy, or hurt
you had always been there
praying for us.
We hereby present this to you.

Boram High School graduates
CHOI Eun-whan.
It's been for over 3 minutes.
Congratulations.
The inheritance is yours as of today.
Are you kidding me?
It's a gift from your grandfather.
He told me to give it to you
when you found something that
you value so much
to give up everything else.
- Jae-kyung!
- Jae-kyung!
Let's eat.
- Yeah, let's go eat.
- Come in
I'm building a house
with many windows.
When the first snow hits
those windows 50 times,
we'll be reunited.
I miss you, Eun-whan.
I didn't think
you'd let me do this.
Trying to seek out a favor?
- If anybody sees this...
- They'll call me a sissy?
I don't care.
Not embarrassed?
This will bring me love.
Why would I be?
Dye my toenails, too.
Remember this?
If you blow it
your wish will come true.
You do remember.
- What are you wishing for?
- For you to grow up.
