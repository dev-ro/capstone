When Pakistan came into existence
during the 1947 partition,
it did so in two parts.
West Pakistan and East Pakistan.
East Pakistan's main language
was Bengali instead of Urdu,
and their lifestyle was different
than that of West Pakistan.
Due to this, Pakistan always
treated them as outcasts
and were cruel towards them.
The Bengali Muslims
and Hindus of East Pakistan
together rebelled
against this brutality in 1970.
To crush this rebellion,
President Yahya Khan and General Tikka
killed three million innocent people
under Operation Searchlight.
India couldn't withstand
the grief of their own people.
Our forces were deployed
towards East Pakistan
and soon we secured
a large part of Pakistan.
Watching half of Pakistan slipping
through his fingers
made Yahya Khan furious.
How many in total?
Three million, sir.
Do you recognise this?
Yes, sir.
It's the national flag
of Pakistan, sir.
Flag of the Star and Crescent.
A flag capable of
soaring new heights.
Back in '47, I knew
the only way to achieve new heights
were over piles dead bodies.
Anything less would
only mean our downfall.
And you... could only muster
up three million bodies.
We've resorted
to public massacre, sir.
But India has taken over
a vast area.
Our forces cannot set foot
in there, sir.
Is this the India
whom we ruled for 400 years
with an iron fist?
Yes, sir.
They killed a handful of our soldiers
in '47 and '65
and forgot their place.
Show these rascals
that this is the new-age Pakistan
of '71.
We have enough explosives
to separate
the Ganga and the Jamuna
and blow up Delhi with the left-over
trucks filled with explosives.
Prepare for a second attack.
Attack?
But, sir,
this is not the right time.
We cannot defend two fronts
at one time.
India has diverted its forces
to the Eastern Front.
The Western territory is open.
We won't find a better opportunity
than this.
Penetrate through Kutch.
Attack Bhuj Airbase.
And take over as many territories
of western India as you can.
-After that?
-After that...
Mrs. Gandhi and I
will share a cup of tea in Delhi.
And make a small business deal
with her.
If she wants western India back,
then she must vacate
East Pakistan.
Simple.
Go to your positions!
I am Vijay Srinivas Karnik.
Commanding officer, Bhuj Airbase.
Come in. Come in.
Sir, seems like someone's
locked the door from outside.
Wars are not won with weapons
but with heroes.
And there's no shortage of heroes
in the Indian Army.
This is fighter pilot
Vikram Singh Baj.
Fire!
Stop firing.
Stop firing the anti-air gun!
Vikram sir is ready to take off.
Stop firing!
Fire!
Two weeks before
Pakistan's attack.
There's a faction of Malayali warriors
called the Nairs.
With a history that dates back
to more than 1,000 years,
they've never bowed
or been defeated by their enemy.
Lt. Col. Nair has kept
this tradition alive.
While representing the Indian Army
in 1968,
Col. Nair broke
a Pakistani boxer's jaw.
This champion of the ring
lost his heart to
a differently-abled Muslim girl, Zeenat.
Here's Vighakot Post.
Take charge of this post
with your fleet of 120 soldiers.
-Just 120, sir?
-Yes.
And Pagi Ranchhod Bhai Savabhai Rabari
will assist you.
Pagi?
Ranchhod Bhai Pagi
lived in a village attached
to the border of Pakistan.
Pakistan Army demanded their animals
for a feast.
Pagi clearly refused.
"We've taken an oath
"to never allow the massacre
of innocent animals."
Pagi didn't let the animals
get massacred
but massacred
five Pakistani soldiers instead.
Pagi came to India and joined RAW.
Jai Hind, sir.
RAW bestowed Ranchhod Bhai
with a very critical operation.
Operation Hoor.
Ranchhod Bhai
is like a desert eagle.
He's well versed with every part of
the desert spanning Kutch and Sindh.
He can tell from the footsteps
on the sand
whether it was the Indian Army
or the Pakistan Army.
His job in Operation Hoor was to
locate Pakistan's secret hideouts
and collecting vital information.
Five days before the attack.
Md. Hussain Omani.
Military Intelligence Head
and India's arch-enemy.
Today he's going
to receive the message
for which he's spent
many restless nights.
We have orders
to wage war against India.
The codename of this operation
is Chengiz Khan.
Friends,
may I have your attention, please?
Wishing Vijay sir and Usha madam
on their 10th marriage anniversary.
And now Vijay sir will express
his feelings for his wife.
Come on, sir!
Come on, sir!
Come on, sir.
Expressive eyes keep conveying
That I'm in love
Your bewitching eyes
And this magical night
My heart's lost
For my sake
For my sake
For the sake of God
Give me your tears
And take my happiness
Forsake the world
And stay with me
Give me your tears
And take my happiness
Forsake the world
And stay with me
And stay with me
Women and children in bunkers.
Boys, on the airfield now.
Come on!
-Yes sir.
-Yes sir.
Move! Move!
Pakistan Air Force fighter jets
aggressively attacked
many airfields in West India
and caused heavy damage to us.
But they couldn't do
much damage to Bhuj.
Reason?
Position of our anti-air guns.
We must change our positions now.
Because they can attack again.
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!
Pakistan's fighter jets have responded
to our message of peace
by attacking our Amritsar,
Srinagar, Pathankot, Avantipur
Utterlai, Jodhpur, Ambala, Faridkot,
Jaisalmer, Alwara and Bhuj.
Tomorrow, with dawn's first light,
we shall give them a fitting reply.
-Any doubts?
-No, sir.
-Can't hear.
-No, sir.
-Can't hear!
-No, sir!
Hey, Balli. What's your plan
after blowing up Pakistan?
I will go home and take my mother
for her knee operation.
Target in sight.
Balli, watch out!
Baljeet.
Baljeet, can you hear me?
Baljeet.
-Vikram, I cannot contact Baljeet.
-Sir, he's no more.
What?
Vikram, our mission is successful.
Come back.
Immediately come back.
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
said in one of her messages
that our army will soon
free East Pakistan
from the atrocities
of West Pakistan.
Where is Balli?
Lord...
"Whatever has been created shall
be destroyed, today or tomorrow.
"Sing the glorious praises of Lord,
giving up all entanglements."
Ranchhod Bhai, begin Operation Hoor.
Begin Operation Hoor.
Three days before the attack.
Sweetheart, Brigadier Baig
and Taimur have arrived.
Don't venture out of the room.
Ten of our spies,
Hameer, Curson, Noora,
Bhima, Altaf, Viran, Zahir, Lateef
Miramad and Abbu,
are working in Kutch for Pakistan.
And at midnight, they will
relay a message to us at 3.1 MHz.
I will decide our strategy
after that.
If Allah wills it,
we shall meet again in two days.
India's brave girl,
Heena Rehman.
Heena is our spy in Pakistan.
Heena's older brother Nazir Rehman
was also our spy in Pakistan.
What do we do with him?
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
"There is none worthy of worship
except Allah,
"and Muhammad is the messenger
of Allah."
"There is none worthy of worship
except Allah..."
Md. Hussain Omani
gave him a dreadful death.
Heena joined RAW
to avenge her brother.
Heena's animosity with Pakistan was
of national and personal interest.
Think about your late brother
and repeat your pledge...
Lord, keep a place for me secure
in your court.
Even if I cease to exist,
keep my motherland unharmed.
Every drop of blood I shed
will be for India.
Even I have to give up my life,
then may it be for India.
Allah, this is my only desire.
And the only thing I wish for now
is your grace and
to be wrapped in the tricolour.
Ten pigeons of the Kauravas
will pass the message
to the Kauravas
at 3.1 MHz,
about the conditions of Kurukshetra.
The Pandavas should know
that they are at 3.3 MHz. 
The Pakistani spies active
in your area...
We have traced the location
of all the Pakistani spies.
Noora, Bhima, Altaf, Viran,
Wahid, Lateef, Miramad,
and that Abu
from Thar Parker village.
They are currently
at Hamir's Bismillah spice factory,
which is a kilometre west
of Haripar Ravapar village.
And they are going
to contact Omani at midnight.
I'll get there with Pagi.
Don't worry, sir. We'll be there.
Our helicopter is
on the take-off runway.
Roger, but travelling
by helicopter can be dangerous.
In 1965,
Pakistan Airforce shot down
Gujarat Chief Minister
Balwantrai Mehta's plane
in this area.
So, you must travel by jeep.
Over.
Laxman,
you will wait at the airbase.
How many Indian soldiers
on the Vighakot Post?
120 Indian soldiers are stationed
at the Vighakot Post along with Pagi.
And a battalion of 60 soldiers
on Bhuj Airport.
They have a staff of 90 people,
and their commanding officer
is Vijay Karnik.
I heard a sound.
Someone's there.
Kill him.
Turn off the lights!
Hello!
Hello, Curson.
What's happening out there, Curson?
Hello, Curson.
Hello!
Code?
Code?
"Shahjahan is the emperor of love."
"Taj Mahal is the symbol of love."
If the Taj Mahal
is the symbol of love,
then India is your father.
Who is speaking?
Your father. Vijay Karnik.
Bhuj Airbase's commanding officer.
Go on.
What's your price to work for us?
I've already collected my price
by killing your spies.
You're crossing your limits.
You don't know our limits.
We're sons of the great
the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
who brought the Mughals down
on their knees
and rewrote the history of India
with his blood.
Thank you.
Colonel.
Our spies are dying.
Indian Navy has sunk our warship
and destroyed the Karachi port.
Our soldiers in Dhaka have stopped
receiving clothes, arms and ammunition.
Indian Army has secured Dhaka,
Chittagong and Sylhet.
And we're lying to our own people
that Pakistan is winning the war.
Let me warn you, sir.
If Indian Army continues
to advance like this...
then we'll surely taste defeat.
No.
We've three ways
to turn this defeat into victory.
One.
100 tanks and 1,800 troops
will march towards Delhi
through Longewala.
Second, PNS Ghazi
will sink INS Vikrant.
And three,
Operation Chengiz Khan, Bhuj.
This is the Kutch area of India.
50% of this area
is covered by sea,
and the rest of the area
is covered by desert.
And these two bridges connect
Kutch with India.
At Surajbari and Banaskantha.
If we launch a sudden attack
and blow up these two bridges,
these five routes
and the Bhuj runway,
then Kutch will be disconnected
from India.
Even if Indian Army
comes through the sea,
Jamnagar or Pune,
they will need 28-48 hours
to reach Bhuj.
And our 100 tanks and 1,800 troops
will cross Harami Nala
from Vighakot
and reach Bhuj in 18 hours
and take over control.
Once Bhuj airport
is in our control,
then India's game is up.
So, you're the traitor.
Say it one last time
before I shoot you.
I love you.
So that I can shoot you.
I love you.
Sir?
Hurry up.
Surround her.
"I bear witness that there
is none worthy of worship
"except Allah,
the One alone, without partner,
"and bear witness
that Muhammad is
"His servant and messenger.
"I bear witness that
there is none worthy of worship
"except Allah,
the One alone, without partner,
"and bear witness
that Muhammad is
"His servant and messenger."
Jai Hind!
Shame on you!
Aren't you ashamed?
Being a Muslim,
you betray Pakistan.
Pakistan is Islam's biggest enemy.
That's why your General Tikka Khan
killed three million Bengali Muslims.
Wasn't that betrayal to Muslims?
Jai Hind!
Sorry, we couldn't save her.
Sardarji, if anything happens to me,
then look after Preeto.
Don't say that.
I see grief in my lion's eyes.
I was thinking about Preeto, sir.
Preeto is now my daughter.
It's coming towards us.
Steady as a rock
Always prepared to fight
This is our motherland
We can lay down our life for it
Pakistan's flag...
Will soon soar over India!
Pakistan's flag...
Will soon soar over India!
Our fighter jets have dropped
1,000 bombs
and 50 time bombs on Bhuj Airbase
and destroyed it.
Now no plane can take off
or land on Bhuj Airbase.
The bridges at Surajbari and Banaskantha
that connected Kutch with India
and the five routes leading to Bhuj
were destroyed by our fighter jets
and have cut off Kutch and Bhuj
from India.
Remember one more thing.
We'll arrive at Indian check post
Vighakot at 11 p.m.
There are 120 Indian soldiers
and one Pagi at the Vighakot Post.
So, we'll need only two hours
to destroy the Indian check post.
Sir, our biggest difficulty
will be crossing Harami Nala.
On one end lies the sea
and quicksand on the other.
Sir, we couldn't cross
Harami Nala back in '65 either.
Why can't we reroute through
Banaskantha and take over Bhuj?
No.
Because even we'll need 48 hours
to reach Bhuj through that route.
And Indian Army
may get reinforcements till then.
We have 100 tanks
and 1,800 troops right now,
If we cross Harami Nala
in two hours
and annihilate all Indian soldiers,
then we'll reach by 1 a.m.
The route to Bhuj Airbase through
Vighakot is around 170 kilometres.
This means we'll be successful in
taking over Bhuj airbase by 5 a.m.
If Allah wills,
we shall be victorious!
Victory...
Is ours!
-Victory...
-Is ours!
-Victory...
-Is ours!
Good news. Yes, I am happy.
Sir.
Congratulations.
When Pakistan adamantly
parted ways with us in 1947,
we knew better than sending away
our brother empty-handed
We sent them off with a few tears
and Rs. 75 crore.
Ammunitions and explosives bought
using the same money
were raining on us.
No country in the world could've paid
such a big price for its decency.
Sir, the runway and control room
are completely destroyed.
The radar room in
the basement is intact.
20 staff members
from the control room
and 20 soldiers from
the anti-aircraft squad are injured.
And fighter pilot
Sagar Mehta's injured too.
He's been taken to the hospital.
Currently, there are no casualties.
-Imran?
-Sir.
Inform everyone's families.
Yes, sir.
That was a time bomb.
-Rajnish.
-Sir.
Start counting
and marking the bombs.
Okay, sir.
Laxman, call the contractor
and start repairing the runway.
-Hurry up.
-Yes, sir.
Pakistani jets caused heavy damage
to Bhuj and Jamnagar bases.
We gave them a fitting reply
and foiled their plans.
But, sir, we lost Baljeet and
Vikram Singh's aircrafts in this attack.
Sad news.
We'll have to be extra alert.
You'll soon receive
your next orders.
Sir.
Papa!
Maulana recently gave me news
from Pakistan's Badin.
He saw 100 tanks
and nearly 1,800 troops
marching towards Vighakot Post.
And yes, Pakistani jets
are scouting the air for their safety.
Sir, Operation Hoor is over.
We have only 120 troops and Pagi
to stop Pakistan's 1,800 troops
and 100 tanks.
We must send more troops
to the Vighakot Post.
Pakistan Air Force launched
a fierce attack on the Bhuj Airbase,
destroying the runway
and the airbase.
Aircrafts can neither off
nor land there.
And we've lost all forms
of communication with them also.
Why can't we send our troops directly
to Vighakot Post using helicopters?
That's not possible.
Because the Pakistan Air Force
is pretty vigilant in this area.
Then what option do we have?
50% of Kutch consists of water,
and the other 50% is desert.
There are only two bridges
that connect Kutch with India.
Surajbari and Banaskantha.
Five of these routes lead to Bhuj.
But Pakistan Air Force has destroyed
all five routes and Bhuj Airbase.
Now we've no forms of
communication with them.
Whether we send our troops
from Rajasthan, Pune or Jamnagar,
they will need at least
28 hours to reach Vighakot.
Pakistan Army with their 100 tanks
and 1800 troops will reach by 11 p.m.
Pakistan Army
can cross Harami Nala
and capture Bhuj Airbase
in 18 hours.
We received this information
pretty late.
How many troops do we have
at Vighakot Post?
120.
If Pakistan Army takes
control over Bhuj Airbase,
then they will try
to negotiate with us
after the war's over,
like they did in '65.
There must be some way
to stop the Pakistani troops.
There's only one way.
Bhuj Airbase's commanding officer
Vijay Karnik repairs the runway;
we send reinforcements
from Jamnagar;
and they stop the Pakistani
troops along with our soldiers,
because we have no communication
with Bhuj Airbase.
Do what it takes,
but our troops should
reach Vighakot Post.
You locked the door, didn't you?
Spies don't use attar.
It's a small wound,
but you may have internal injuries.
You should get an X-ray
and some rest.
Sir...
Once we win the war,
I'll get an X-ray and all the rest I need.
Sir, there are approximately
50 time bombs around the runway.
But none of them
has a timer on them.
We've no clue which bomb
is going to explode when.
Sir, going beyond this point
is dangerous.
We don't even have
a bomb diffuser suit.
This bomb is so powerful
that, whether you're wearing
iron suits
or hiding behind a cement wall,
it will still blow you to pieces.
If we're destined to die,
then no one can save us.
Connect all bombs to a single fuse
and bury them under the ground.
Sir, 40 soldiers were martyred.
Clear the area.
-Clear the area.
-Sir.
Get this repaired
and connect me to headquarters.
Yes, sir.
Sir...
Maratha Baagh here.
Maratha Baagh, the enemy will
lay siege on Vighakot at 11 p.m.
and take over Bhuj Airbase
by 5 a.m.
Sir...
All the private engineers
and workers have fled from Bhuj.
Send military workers
by helicopter.
Both companies are repairing
the Jaisalmer, Amritsar
and the other runways.
If the runway isn't repaired
by dawn,
then we'll lose Kutch
to the enemies.
-Over and out. 
-Sir.
We're here in Jamnagar
and here's Vighakot.
If we use our fighter planes
to attack Pakistani jets and troops
at the Vighakot Post,
then there's a danger of injuring
our own troops.
And Pakistani planes
can shoot down our planes.
Except for the route
between Vighakot and Bhuj,
the Pakistanis have destroyed
all other routes leading to Bhuj.
Sir, if we send our troops
through Mandvi, Mundra, Gandhidham,
they will take at least
28-48 hours in reaching Vighakot.
Sir, we have only one option.
Deploying our troops
in Bhuj through cargo planes.
-Jai Hind, sir.
-Jai Hind.
There's a big risk in sending troops
to your post using helicopters.
So, the troops will be deployed
at Bhuj Airbase in packs of 24.
Two helicopters have taken off from
Jamnagar airport with 48 troops.
Sir...
And, this evening, 24 troops have
taken the sea route to reach your post.
And to outsmart
the Pakistani forces,
these troops have been
sent by civilian boats.
They will reach your post
between 4-8 hours.
No matter how hard we try
to send troops to your post,
we cannot send more than
100 troops for your reinforcement.
The safety of Kutch
and Bhuj is in your hands.
Over and out.
Sir, three battalions of
the Pakistan Army along with 100 tanks
are going to attack
our post at 11 p.m.
We'll stand our ground and fight.
Soldiers...
as long as Vijay Karnik doesn't
repair the runway at Bhuj airfield
and we don't receive
more reinforcements,
we'll have to keep the enemy
at bay.
I know it's a dangerous job.
We're only 120,
and the enemy are in thousands
along with tanks.
But I've promised my motherland
that, even if we lose our heads,
our bodies will continue fighting.
With even a drop of blood
in our bodies,
the enemy cannot cross
this post and set foot in Kutch.
Let's make a promise
to ourselves.
-We'll challenge...
-Death!
-We'll challenge...
-Death!
-We'll challenge...
-Death!
-Glory to...
-Mother India!
-Glory to...
-Mother India!
The runway was devastated like
a house caught up in a cyclone.
The sight of destruction
was enough to discourage anyone.
Then suddenly I remembered someone.
A woman.
From a broken button
of a shirt to a broken courage,
women can fix anything.
Gujarat's lioness, Sunderben.
Sunderben!
Sunderben!
Jai Hind! Jai-Jai Garvi Gujarat!
Jai Hind! Jai-Jai Garvi Gujarat!
Violence is a sin.
But Lord Krishna has said
violence committed
for saving someone's life
is righteousness.
Most of the men from this village
travel far and wide
to earn a living.
Like my husband.
There are only women, children
and old folks in this village.
My mother-in-law is always worried
about what we'll do
if we're faced with a problem.
But I have cleared her worries.
I slayed the leopard.
Now I wish to slay Raavan too.
As long as the sun shines
in the sky,
may India shine just as bright.
Jai Sri Ram!
Jai Sri Ram!
Sir, all the workers who could repair
the runway have fled from Bhuj,
so I've decided to take the help
of civilians from the neighbouring
village to repair the runway.
You can't use civilians
during the war.
If any lives are lost
during an attack,
then you can be court-martialled.
Sir, I don't mind
being court-martialled,
but I can't let Bhuj fall
into enemy hands.
This is an impossible task,
Squadron Leader.
I'm Marathi, sir.
I can give up my life but not my word.
Sunderben, the country needs you.
Jadhavji bhai.
Yes?
Bring Vijay sir to the temple
after 30 minutes.
Okay.
The Pakistan Army is
coming to take over Kutch.
To stop the Indian Army
from coming to our aide,
Pakistani planes
have destroyed the Bhuj airstrip.
I am going to repair the airstrip
to help the Indian Army.
Will you come with me?
Why is everyone quiet?
The country needs us.
Pakistani planes
are dropping bombs.
Imagine what will happen
to our children if we're dead.
The benefactor of
the entire world, Lord Krishna,
he won't let any harm come to us.
But if we don't help our country
and the enemy takes control,
then we'll all have
to swallow poison together.
Lord Shiva won't come to our aide.
Everyone will be disrobed publicly.
Lord Krishna won't come
to save our honour.
But if we vow to fight against
these tyrants like the Pandavas,
then Lord Krishna will guide us.
Wait a minute.
My friend used to say...
If I get killed on the border
and breathe my last,
then send me back
to my old mother.
It's her dream
to see me dressed as a groom.
Make her wish come true.
Dress me as a groom
and take out a procession
throughout the village
and tell my mother
your son has arrived as a groom.
Though he has not got his bride,
he has brought
a grand procession."
My father...
A jolly old soldier.
He used to say, "Come back
when the tricolour is flying high
"or when you're wrapped in it."
I marked his words.
Never showed my back to the enemy.
Also took a bullet on my chest
for the country.
My kid brother.
Ask him if he'll keep my promise.
We made a promise that
if one son dies, another
will take his place at the border.
My little sister.
Tell her I remember her gift.
But unfortunately,
I had to keep my promise
to my motherland first.
Don't miss the house near the well.
That's where she lives.
The one I promised
to live and die with.
Tell her the motherland
comes before she does.
I broke one promise
for another one.
One last request, one last wish.
Don't mourn my death.
I've chosen this martyrdom.
I live to die.
I am called a soldier.
My team and I will rebuild
the airstrip with Sunderben.
Whether you help me or not.
Mr. Vijay.
I will help you.
My entire troupe and I will help you
rebuild the airstrip.
Then bring your drums along.
We'll celebrate
once the airstrip's rebuilt.
Horses, elephants, palanquin
Glory to Lord Krishna!
Horses, elephants, palanquin
Glory to Lord Krishna!
O Lord, O benefactor, O creator
O Lord, O benefactor, O creator
O protector of worlds, fearless one
O God of Gods
O merciful one
The wise one, omniscient one
O giver of wealth, merciful one
O destroyer of evil
Bestower of happiness
O giver of strength and valour
May we be successful in our foray
The light of humanity
Spreads far and wide
Every basks in the divine light
Annihilate the darkness
History be created every moment
And relationships stay intact
Kindness be practised everywhere
Humans should know their way
Every girl should be wise
And every boy should be resolute
May the tricolour
Fly higher than the sky
And our lands
Be blessed with plenty
As long as the sun shines
In the sky
So does this motherland
So does this motherland
A woman's most valuable
possession is her home.
We needed bricks and
stones to build the runway.
The women of Bhuj broke
their homes with their own hands
and proved India first,
rest comes later.
During high tide,
water from the sea
slowly flows into the desert
through the canal
and recedes by midnight.
Why don't we block the mouth
of the sea with cement
and make a dam?
Brilliant idea.
And we'll plant
landmines, anti-tank mines
and dynamite under the dam.
When Pakistan Army
tries to cross the dam,
we'll blow it up.
Come.
Waqar, go with Somnath.
Get every bag of cement you can
from Lakhpat, Mata no Madh and Naliya
and as many barrels of petrol,
diesel and engine oil.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
Sir, keep 10 barrels of petrol,
diesel and engine oil
in Lakhpath's soda factory.
-Sir.
-Sir.
Take the truck to Kunda Chowki
and get as many dynamites,
anti-tank mines,
landmines and explosives
you can get.
Sir.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh fought
21 battles in his lifetime
and never lost.
He didn't fight these wars for
women, property or wealth.
He fought these wars
to protect and safeguard
his religion and
the existence of India.
Guru Gobind Singh and his family
made many sacrifices to protect India.
Now we must fight
for that same India
and also sacrifice ourselves
if required.
Utter thy name...
And we shall triumph!
Vijay Karnik is repairing the runway,
and I'm going to land this jet there.
The chances of safely
landing this aircraft
and our survival are 1%.
There is no pressure on you.
Only those 250 soldiers
who don't value their lives
can come with me on this mission.
Imran, take all the children
to the bunkers
and call everyone's wives here.
Yes, sir.
Tell Usha to arrange for everyone's food
at the Swaminarayan temple
-and meet us back here.
-Okay, sir.
Laxman, turn on the headlights
of all trucks and jeeps
and point them towards the runway.
Roger.
Sir.
Instead of 250, 500 troops are willing
to come with you on this mission.
Make preparations.
Sir!
When this siren goes off,
it means the enemy planes
are coming to bomb us.
As soon as you hear this siren,
you'll steer clear of the airstrip
and do exactly as Laxman's doing.
Laxman.
And as soon as the danger is over,
you will hear another siren.
Meaning you can return to work.
Okay, Charlie.
Okay and out.
We cannot send any more troops
to Bhuj Airbase through helicopters
because Pakistan Navy
has blown up our helicopter.
And they also blew up
the boat in which 12 soldiers
of the Sikh regiment
were travelling.
Vikram Singh, landing a plane
in Bhuj Airbase is very dangerous.
Sir, no need to worry.
Faster. Faster.
The troops have been positioned
according to your markings.
Jai Hind, sir.
Sir.
I see grief in my lion's eyes.
Sir, this plane cannot carry
500 troops.
We'll have to lessen the load.
We've kept soda bottles
filled with petrol and crude oil
at a distance of 30 feet each.
We'll throw these bottles
at the enemy and fire at them.
And these bottles
will serve as ten bullets.
This will cause more damage to the enemy
and we'll waste fewer bullets.
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!
20 troops will stay with me
on that side of the canal,
20 troops on the dam,
and the rest will be on this side
of the canal with Pagi.
We'll keep changing our positions
after opening fire.
-Any doubts?
-No, sir!
-Can't hear.
-No, sir!
-Can't hear!
-No, sir!
Good.
Here's your fake Pakistani ID.
Your name is Jamil Khan.
That's the artillery firing
by the Pakistan Army
to suppress
the sound of their tanks.
Do you remember
Pakistan Army's code word?
Yes, sir.
According to our strategy,
I'll make the Pakistani tanks
form a single line.
Okay.
Turn off the lights.
Run!
Aim!
Sir, we'll build it again.
Am I right, sisters?
Yes, we'll build it again!
Yes, we'll build it again!
Pakistani jets attacked us again.
We shot down two of them.
They dropped 25 bombs,
and one of them fell on the runway
that we were rebuilding
and formed a 20-feet crater.
Sir, if our planes keep
hovering over Bhuj Airbase,
then their planes
won't dare to attack again.
And we can rebuild the runaway
without any interruptions.
Okay, Squadron Leader.
Anarkali.
Akbar's girl.
Where are you coming from?
Vighakot Post.
How many troops are posted there?
1,500.
I am going to give this news
to headquarters.
What are their intentions?
What strategy are they planning?
There are explosives
on both sides of the bridge,
so you must use the bridge.
Good.
Thanks for the information.
Goodbye.
May God bless you
with His grace too.
1,500 Indian troops
were posted there.
Yes, sir.
We've been warned about this,
so we must be alert.
Yes, sir.
O Goddess Karni,
I'm bestowing the honour
of my country and mine in your hands.
Now I'll wear this turban
only the day I win the war.
Glory to Goddess.
"The enemy's ready to charge
With guns blazing"
"And I'm ready
To take every bullet"
"We'll fight till the last drop of blood
If required"
"The desire to sacrifice my life
Is on my mind"
"Let's see how courageous
The enemy is"
No one will open fire
until I don't say so.
-Okay, sir.
-Over.
Fire!
Move the tanks to the left. Quick!
Damn it! Shoot!
Fire!
The old man betrayed us.
He lied to us.
He's bluffed us.
Charge at the enemy!
Don't worry.
These are our planes.
Please...
Fire! Fire!
Steer all tanks to the left.
Silver formation here.
-Sir, runway ready for landing.
-Yes, Maratha Baagh.
Ready to fly, sir.
All clear. Repeat.
The weight of 500 troops
is too much, sir.
Vikram, reduce about
50 soldiers from there.
Okay, okay, sir.
You all put your lives at risk
and repaired the runway
in a single night.
India will always be indebted
to you.
I salute all of you.
Vikram Singh just
took off with 450 soldiers.
Keep the vehicles ready
so the troops can be immediately
sent to Vighakot Post.
Okay, sir.
The sun anoints your face
Every branch showers flowers on you
The winds fill your chambers
The raindrops wash your feet
Hail Lord Ganesha
Hail Lord Ganesha
Sir, Squadron Leader Vikram Singh.
Silver formation.
Maratha Baagh, we're ready to land.
The patches haven't dried up yet.
Land carefully.
All the best.
But the front wheel of my plane
is damaged.
Please come on the runway
with the trolley.
The trolley was destroyed
in the bombing.
Keep circling in the air
until I ready my truck.
I'll wave my kerchief as soon
as the truck's speed reaches 120.
You can land your front tyre
on the truck's carrier.
All the best.
Okay.
Brother.
As soon as the plane lands
on the truck,
the truck's speed
will increase to 400 kilometres.
The truck's tyres will explode.
It's dangerous.
This landing is not possible, brother.
Have you forgotten Father's words?
Marathas know only two things.
To kill or be killed.
Hail Bhawani
We owe our breaths to the country
We'll repay it with our lives
We were born as humans
And depart as martyrs
We owe our breaths to the country
We'll repay it with our lives
We were born as humans
And depart as martyrs
We shall rest hearing
A lullaby of bullets
Born as sons to our mothers
We shall die
As sons of the soil
Don't be sad, O motherland
Whenever you think of us
We shall return from our sleep
To protect again
We owe our breaths to the country
We'll repay it with our lives
We were born as humans
And depart as martyrs
We shall rest hearing
A lullaby of bullets
Born as sons to our mothers
We shall die
As sons of the soil
Don't be sad, O motherland
Whenever you think of us
We shall return from our sleep
To protect again
In every lifetime, I want to be
A soldier of my motherland
India happily reaped
its own land. 
They didn't want to snatch
anyone's land.
Even after winning the war,
we didn't seize control
of East Pakistan.
Instead, we created a new country,
Bangladesh,
and returned the country
to whom it belonged.
The geography of the world
changed forever.
And Yahya Khan's dreams
of sharing tea with Mrs. Gandhi
could never come true.
Sir, tea.
Congratulations.
Well done.
O land of mine
I live for your pride
Nothing is more valuable
Than the soil of my country
Your light shines bright
Your breeze keeps me alive
You're my heaven
And I'm your little bird
Such is my request
I want to fade away
In your light
If the country ever remembers
How one perished for their country
My name should be mentioned too
O country of mine
I live for your pride
Nothing is more valuable
Than the soil of my country
Your light shines bright
Your breeze keeps me alive
You're my heaven
And I'm your little bird
May your glory
Always be colourful
May the tricolour fly higher
Than the sky
Bless me with life
Or the will to attain martyrdom
I accept whatever you choose
Whether in the finest silks
Or a soldier's shroud
I accept to be wrapped
In anything you choose
O land of mine
I live for your pride
Nothing is more valuable
Than the soil of my country
Your light shines bright
Your breeze keeps me alive
You're my heaven
And I'm your little bird
