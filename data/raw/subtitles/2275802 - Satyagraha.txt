Crazy ab out m oney!
Uncle, m oney makes the w orld m ove.
The desire f or pr ofits

And c ompetiti on gives

These w ords s ound impressive...
but the truth is, that

Just think ab out it...
if there is n o greed.
Why w ould any one w ork hard?
lt 's quite simple uncle. T o m ove ahead.
Greed, pr ofit, m oney,
these are n ot mere w ords!
They lead t o devel opment!
And the Private Sect or
really understands this.
Take a l o ok at any Private Business...
lt 's neat, clean and full  of energy,
And the G overnment
office full  of c orrupti on!
L o ok! The r o ot cause  of c orrupti on is
- Greed!
lt 's like a Tsunami...
Businessmen are greedy f or illegal

Y ou will never accept it,

Since y ou were n ot ar ound, l

Because y ou are scared  of y our dad,
y ou d on 't want t o drink and sm oke.

But the l ogic behind this Nati onal

L o ok at y our qualificati ons!
Just imagine y our life after 35 years,

30-40-50 lakhs  of

Y ou w on 't be able t o

Wh o wants a car?
My dream is t o  open a small sch o ol,

Dad, Manav did n ot mean...
Yes, l can see that.
See what he 's d one t o

This is his plan, S on.
T o trap y ou in his

Just what was needed!
The Pr ofess or was  off his head.
Precisely!
He l ost his head with anger.
And, fed up.
Pe ople are fed up.
Rem ove them!
What are y ou d oing?!
G overnment  orders. Were clearing this.
D 'y ou see this atr ocity?
They w on 't even let us speak!
Hey, hey, Mr. Leader!
Where the hell have y ou dr opped fr om?
Fr om Delhi!
Delhi...
Then why are y ou lecturing here?
lf y ou had a pr oblem,
y ou sh ould 've c ome t o me.

Arjun Singh is always there!
With out my permissi on, n o party can

And, y ou think y ou can just land
here and begin blasting y our speeches?!
See, Mr. Arjun, l am n ot
trying t o be a leader here.
l just want t o get my uncle released.
Y ou mean Dwarka Anand?
Yes!
That slap was inevitable.
The rascal c ollect or is t otally c orrupt.
But, h ow d o we twist his arm n ow?.
Amassing cr owds is n ot a pr oblem.
But that w ont affect

We need t o light a

P op?
That bl o ody minister... Balram Singh
Hey Yasmin! Check this  out!
What is this?
Real Juicy stuff.
Last night a H ome Minister
fr om a state was with a call-girl.
We have s ome wild f o otage!
S o?
lts a sensati onal st ory! Lets air it.
Never! Y ou guys!
This is cheapj ournalism,
c ompletely unethical.
We d on 't st o op s o l ow.
What pe ople d o in their pers onal lives,

Yasmin, this is the Prime Minister,
f or G ods sake!
H ow can y ou ask him such questi ons?
Why n ot? He had said that...
lndia believes in gr owth
with s ocial justice, right?
But, n ow that b oth are clashing,
what will he ch o ose?
Hi Manav. What 's up?
L ots.
Listen, l have a fantastic st ory.
A retired sch o ol teacher...
g ot s o fed up with administrati on,
that he slapped the district c ollect or.
Okay.
S o, what 's the st ory?
He is in pris on n ow.
Well, that 's hardly surprising.
He is my uncle, Yasmin.
My friend Akhilesh 's father.
l am s o s orry Manav.
But... l cant d o this st ory.
That w ould be unpr ofessi onal.
N o, its n ot like that.
His slap has created a st orm here.
Th ousands  of pe ople
are  out  on the r oads.
Just check  out the Ambikapur
Rev oluti on Site Page  on Faceb o ok.
Y ou cant imagine h ow
bad the situati on is.
My uncles resp onse has
triggered  off a rev oluti on here!
A hundred th ousand pe ople!
All  of them demanding his release.
Sandeep, y ou 'll have t o send s ome one

What!?
Thanks f or c oming.
Where 's every one?!
Y ou sh owed me th ousands  on Faceb o ok.

They must be  on their way.
What sh ould l sh o ot, Ma 'am?
Listen Mr. Manav Raghvendra...

assignment t o see y our cheap tricks here.
And, f or G od 's sake, at least d on 't

l admit that l exaggerated
the numbers  on Faceb o ok.
But, Yasmin, y ou are needed here.
Y ou cant imagine h ow utterly helpless

lf s omething is n ot d one n ow...
the public will really rev olt.
And that is g oing t o be very vi olent.
S orry, madam. N o cameras all owed here.
l just want t o speak

Please understand.
Wait  outside.
G o od M orning Sir.
Why did y ou slap the D.M.?
Because he deserved it.
But, h ow can y ou take
the law in y our  own hands?
That 's why l 'm here!
And that is fine.
Are y ou aware that there is a massive
campaign  on  outside, f or y our release?
Orchestrated by Manav Raghavendra.
And, he tricked me
int o c oming here as well.
Let 's g o.
Mr. Arjun, what 's y our plan n ow?.
With Manav 's brains and  our strength...

One st one starts a landslide. A
spark can light a prairie fire.
Were seeing s omething
like that in Ambikapur.
On May 25, a highly respected
and m orally upright Dwarka Anand...
a firm believer in Gandhian
n on-vi olence, slapped the c ollect or.
He was arrested and
is in p olice cust ody.
But, that  one slap has
created a massive m ovement here!
ls this the beginning
of a new rev oluti on?
Manav Raghavendra is his name.
The man behind this upheaval.
Yes...
but the matter is getting seri ous.
We have t o d o s omething.
Why!
Sir, Ambikapur is
Balram Singh 's terrain.
The DM is his man.
Let him bear the c onsequences.
lf he gets pre occupied with this,
hell be  out  of  our hair.
Namaste.
Namaste Mr. Kalikant.
Hell o.
Meanwhile, we c onducted
p olls  on Faceb o ok and Twitter.
On the Ambikapur Rev oluti on Site.
Of 137896 v otes, 72% felt
the slap was legitimate.
Daduji 's hand may have hit the D.M.
But, the slap was actually
on the g overnments face!
Mr. Balram, the media is
just exaggerating this.
But, y ou sh ouldn 't w orry.
Y ou have the CMs full supp ort.
And, mine as well.
Abs olutely! Deal with it firmly.
N o c ompr omise!
Thank y ou Sir. Thank y ou.
With friends like y ou,
wh o needs enemies.
Y ou are an idi ot, Sangram Singh!
l gave y ou a 5 billi on c ompany,
but y our brains aren 't w orth a cent.
Y ou cant handle even  one district?
And y ou, Mr. D.M. Why have
y ou created s o much tensi on?
ln my  own district!
Sir but... actually...
Didn 't y our father ever
slap y ou in childh o od?
lmagine this  oldie t o be y our p op.
F orgive and f orget, pal.
And y ou, Mr. Suprintendent?
What  on earth are y ou upt o?
But sir, tensi ons have really escalated.
They have surr ounded the p olice stati on.
l am imp osing a curfew.
Why d on 't y ou imp ose a curfew
on my p olitical career as well?
Y our p ower has g ot y ou drunk!
Release, Dadu!
D own with Balram Singh!
St op this sl oganeering. St op it!
Y ou pe ople, please c ontinue.
The public has a right t o be angry.
Let them sh out. Please c ontinue.
D own with Balram Singh.
D own with Balram Singh.
ldi ot!
The public has a right t o be upset.
The mistake is mine.
Getting busy with state matters,
l neglected my  own h ome.
And, an injustice  occurred.
l admit my mistake.
And, l will rectify it t oday, right n ow!
C ome...
C ome...
Y ou band guys, clear  off n ow.
l c onsider Mr. Dwarka as
the guardian  of Ambikapur.
S o, there is n o shame in
accepting a punishment fr om him.
Hence,  our c ollect or has withdrawn
his c omplaint and ap ol ogises t o Daduji.
And, l hereby ann ounce his freed om!
L ong live Daduji.
Y ou cann ot expel me fr om
y our sch o ol t oday, Sir.
On this happy  occasi on
l request Daduji t o...
kindly accept this
gift fr om the g overnment.
When l was behind bars...
l  often th ought  of my s on Akhilesh.
And w ondered what he
w ould 've d one, if he were alive.
And, l realized that pr obably he
w ould 've d one what g ot d one here.
Perhaps Akhilesh 's
absence is being filled n ow.
Perhaps l have f ound an other s on.
L ong live Manav.
Splendid, splendid!
This is d ouble happiness!
S o Mr. Dwarka, kindly
accept this cheque n ow.
Pard on me, but l
cann ot accept this cheque.
But why?
l didn 't slap the DM  only...
because my cheque was getting delayed.
lt was als o f or th ose milli ons  of
c omm on pe ople wh o have t o wait f or...
years  on end just t o
receive their legitimate claims.
But, h ow are the tw o things c onnected?
They are, Mr. Minister.
The frustrati on, desperati on and
humiliati on that l suffered...
is inflicted by y our c orrupt
system  on these pe ople every day.
S o, n ow all  of us will c onfr ont y our
c orrupti on and injustice unitedly.
l have a right t o this cheque...
but l w ont accept it until all the...
pending applicati ons gathering dust...
in Ambikapur 's
g overnment  offices are cleared.
Tell me, Mr. Dwarka...
h ow many dues and claims
are pending in this district?
D o y ou kn ow that, Mr. Minister?
lf n ot, start finding  out.
Because l 'm giving y ou 30 days f or this.
And y our time starts... n ow!
ls this aj oke, Mr. Dwarka?
30 days, Mr Minister! 30 days.
Else the public will
really make aj oke  out  of y ou.
Let 's g o.
L ong live Daduji!
He refused y our c ompensati on. What
w ould y ou like t o say ab out that?
This cheque  of 2.5 milli on is g oing
t o re-write Ambikapur 's hist ory...
Acquitted  of the charge  of slapping the DM,
Mr. Dwarka Anand has thr own an  open challenge...
t o b oth the g overnment
and the administrati on.
30 days t o clear the c ountless
files buried under c orrupti on!
lnteresting times ahead.
But t oday, a 70-year
old sch o ol teacher...
has given a p owerful push t o
the jammed wheels  of dem ocracy.
At Gandhi Ch owk, Ambikapur.

Yasmin Ahmed, ABP News.

H olding al oft a burning t orch!

Daduji, d o y ou think that the g overnment
will take any acti on  on y our ultimatum?
This G overnment is n ot

Sumitra is right. Well
have t o d o everything.
We need t o first find  out
ab out all the pending cases.
But h ow, Daduji?
S o many villages, t owns...
must be milli ons  of cases.
lf we g o t o them, it 'll c ost us time.
lnstead, they c ould reach
us easily, in less time.
But... h ow?.
- Get me a whiteb oard. - Sure, br other.
H ow many bl ocks are there in Ambikapur?
Seven...
And h ow many c ouncils in each bl ock?
Ab out 30-35.
7 int o 35...
245.
We have t o reach 245 c ouncils.
We use a three-pr onged strategy.
Mark the entry-exit
p oints  of the bl ocks.
Then, train v olunteers
in each c ouncil area.
Can we get 490 educated pe ople, Arjun?
l can get y ou d ouble
that number. ln 24 h ours.
G o od!
We train them t o ph ot oc opy,
scan, email and st ore...
Open c ollecti on centres in the
marketplace  of every c ouncil.
Tw o...
We publicise Dadujis appeal
thr ough pamphlets, cable TV...
Play his audi o-visual
rec ordings  on s ocial media day & night.
Cycles, rickshaws and h orse-carts will

Yasmin, if y ou can get s ome news
channels t o c over the appeal st ory...
that w ould be the icing  on the cake.
Arjun, gather v olunteers.
Sumitra, c onduct the training.
And lndr ojeet, take

This way we can
gather 70-80% the claims.
W ow b oss! All we needed was y ou.
With y ou in the team,

This resignati on

N o way. Resignati on is  out  of questi on.
On the c ontrary, the

and made him in-charge  of all
the pr ojects  of the district.
What ab out the fly over

The minister  ordered that himself.
Fr om an internati onal firm,

Always busy.

Y ou 're attacking the very branch  on

Every legislat or  of every

Only s o he can earn

N o  one has the right t o

And, y ou can then kiss y our

The shares  of Manav Raghvendra 's

What seems certain is
that the small invest or...
wh o had put in hard-earned savings
int o this c ompany, will l ose the m ost..
Billi ons  of rupees.
The charges are very seri ous.
We 're investigating.
Strict acti on will be taken
against every irregularity.
The biggest charge
against Manav Raghvendra...
is his c onnecti on with the
p olitical fixer Sundarlal Khatri.
Acc ounts  of his lavish 5-star nightlife

Especially with Malini Mishra.
Stay tuned with us...

P o or pe ople have been taken f or a ride.
He has t o answer f or that!
Distrust and betrayal!
There 's tremend ous
anger in the l ocals here.
Even three days after the p olice acti on,
Manav Raghvendra 's whereab outs remain a mystery.
Where is he?
lt is clear that Dwarka
Anand 's m ovement has c ollapsed.
Sir, here are the papers

Why are y ou d oing this, Manav?

N ob ody will break the law!
Mr. Durgalal! Arrest him n ow!
On what charge?
He is a fraud!
He 's caused l osses t o the public.
What fraud have l d one?
Wh o has suffered l osses here?
After having destr oyed everything...
why have y ou c ome back?
l 'm answerable t o  only  one man.
l can understand why
d o ors have been shut  on me.
l admit that l used
illegitimate means in my business.
They say that milli ons  of
invest ors  of my c ompany will l ose heavily.
But, l 've changed everything.
My c ompany isn 't w orth Rs. 50 billi on...
but 67.13 billi on.
l 've distributed all  of that
am ong my w orkers, banks...
and invest ors with pr ofit.
N o  one has suffered even a rupee 's l oss.
l 'm left with just  one thing n ow...
A small h ope that y ou

Uncle...

After l osing my
parents in the accident...
Akhilesh gave me back my life.
Then, he t o o left me.
N ow, l d on 't want t o be
orphaned f or the third time.
l will accept any
punishment that y ou declare.
When the accusati ons were
flying thick and fast...
it isn 't that l wasn 't upset.
Manav disapp ointed us...
made us sad.
And, there will be a punishment.
His punishment is that
he will stay here...
and finish the pending task.
He has given up everything
and f oll owed his c onscience.
F or such mendicants,  our

L ong live Manav!
We c ouldn 't understand y ou!
But, n ow that y ou 're back...

f or these c orrupt fell ows.
Daduji, if y ou permit,
l 'd like t o say s omething.
Of c ourse. Please c ome.
Rec ord this.
Br others, my eyes have been  opened by...
what l witnessed here.
l 'm ashamed.
Daduji rejects the c ompensati on f or his

Manav sacrifices all his

And here...
l wear this unif orm t o

Shame  on me if l serve

The austerity  of truth...

Y ou think l 'm a beggar?

Fr om bl ock t o district,

But, n o rati on f or me, n o

Then pr ocess this immediately.
Y ou will get n o m oney here.

Why sh ould they pay f or y our

What the hell is g oing  on here?
N othing.
A clean-up  operati on.
This place has bec ome t o o dirty.
Get  out fr om here,  or else...
Y ou 'll get us arrested, right?
What else can y ou d o, Mr. C ollect or!
Perhaps y ou 've f org otten...

Arrest them.
H ow can y ou arrest us?
T o o many pe ople. Might cause a pr oblem.
Final warning:

Change y our ways! Or we 'll be back.
Everyday!
Until this system impr oves!
Sir, we admit that
the system has failed.
But, are y our meth ods right?
What d o y ou mean?
The way y our pe ople
manhandled  officials...
threatened them...
lsn 't this plain h o oliganism?
Well, y ou...
One minute...
Please stand up.
This is Nekram.
His father t o ok an agricultural l oan...
fr om a public bank.
lt 's been seven years...
since they repaid it with interest.
And yet, they 're still making
the r ounds  of g overnment  offices.
His father passed away last year.
And yet, they just
cant get their land back!
N ow, w ould y ou like t o advise him...
on what he sh ould d o?
S o what 's the plan  of acti on?
The Pe oples Satyagraha C ommittee has
deliberated  over this and has decided t o...
place their instructi ons
in fr ont  of the G overnment.
lnstructi ons?
Yes, instructi ons...
ln a dem ocracy, the G overnment
functi ons t o serve pe ople...
lndeed, then, the
pe ople are the masters.
And a master d oesn 't plead, he c ommands.
First instructi on...
Get rid  of the Ambikapur C ollect or.
Sec ond instructi on...
C.B.l investigati on  of the
P olice acti on at  our rally.
And the third instructi on...
Make laws via an Ordinance.
Guarantee pe ople the
right t o G overnment services.
Appr oval... n ot disp osal...
G one are the days when a
file c ould be stalled.
And this law be enf orced immediately.
Within seven days.
Seven days.
H ow can such a vital law be
implemented in just 7 days?
D o y ou realize the implicati ons  of this?
lf n ot pressurized, even
700 days w ont be en ough.
lf an Emergency can be declared
in this c ountry within 24 h ours...
7 days are m ore than
en ough f or this Ordinance.
And there will be n o c ompr omise.
S o, acc ording t o y ou, what
is the future  of this c ountry?
This is lndia 's future! Ravi Kumar.
Parents were lab ourers.
The g overnment-run sch o ol  of
his village was t otally defunct.
By painstakingly saving m oney...
they sent him t o a private sch o ol.
After sch o ol, they t o ok a l oan
t o fund his c omputer training.
T oday he w orks in a private firm,
n ot in the g overnment.
Salary: 40,000.
He is the future  of  our c ountry...
Unlike his ancest ors, he
d oesn 't w orship the g overnment.
The g overnment is merely a
service-pr ovider t o wh om he pays fees...
in the f orm  of taxes.
lf he d oesn 't get service,
he will st op paying.
Like any  other client
- Peri od!
This new lndia is telling the
g overnment and p oliticians t o wake up!
lmpr ove y our r oads, p ower,
p olice, h ospitals,  officers...
Repair y our entire system!
Otherwise, y ou have n o future!
He 's g oing berserk, sir.
ls vitiating the
atm osphere in Ambikapur.
Say the w ord, sir...
Shut up, f o ol!
Eager-beaver!
There 's n othing he can d o.
l have every one 's life-line in my hands.
They 've threatened
c omplete n on-c o- operati on.
They 'll st op paying taxes, and...
L o ok...
There are laws in this c ountry!
lf th ose are br oken,
strict acti on will f oll ow.
Please pass  on these instructi ons
of the pe ople t o the g overnment.
What are y ou d oing?
Calm d own.
This is wr ong.
St op it.
D o what y ou can!
Y our deadline ends in 7 days.
We will n ot rest...
until  our instructi ons are f oll owed.
This matter is getting seri ous n ow.
This is an  open rev olt!
Direct attack  on the C ollect orate.
H ow c ould the c ops all ow this?
Sir, perhaps the H ome Minister
w ould like t o share his plan  of acti on.
T ough acti on is required.
The g overnment cann ot
appear weak. We will...
We will invite them f or a discussi on.
Mr. Kalikant, this
m ovement has n o public supp ort.
When they c ome f or the meeting...
they will be exp osed.
Welc ome.
Mr. Manav, the champi on  of the pe oples
m ovement. One instructi on after an other!
Y ou seem t o have taken the
mickey  out  of us p oliticians!
Thank y ou all f or c oming here.
The p olice acti on  on
y our rally was uncalled f or.
We are investigating it.
Regarding the first
demand  on y our list...
Replace the Ambikapur
C ollect or immediately.
Mr. Manav! App ointing a DM...
running the administrati on is
the g overnments prer ogative.
And the g overnment d oesn 't
run  on y our instructi ons.
Then why are y ou wasting
y our time by calling us here?
Okay, well replace the C ollect or.
Thank y ou!
But the new C ollect or will
be ch osen by the pe ople.
Mr. Manav, Mr. Manav,
Pe ople elect leaders...
n ot C ollect ors.
Then change that system!
Give us a list  of five  officers.
Pe ople will ch o ose  one fr om that.
Relax Manav.
D on 't y ou think y ou
are g oing a bit t o o far!
Manav, lets hear them  out.
Things are getting t o o heated up.
Tea break?
G o od idea.
Can y ou calm d own Manav.
N o matter ab out the meeting.
We need t o speak  of an imp ortant matter.
L o ok, Mr. Manav...
this s o-called Ambikapur
rev oluti on  of y ours...
will c ollapse like a pack  of cards...
if l reveal that y our friend...
Akhilesh Anand, was resp onsible f or the
fly over c ollapse where 7 lab ourers died.
What d o y ou mean?!
The fly over c ollapsed
because his design was flawed.
What rubbish!
Y ou 're lying!
Relax, chill.
l 'm n ot saying this.
The rep ort  of the expert
internati onal agency says s o.
l was embarrassed t o o.
Assuming his brilliance, l put him
in charge  of the districts pr ojects.
Hence, l suppressed the
real details  of the rep ort.
And, dear sir, if y ou d on 't st op
this circus  of instructi ons and all...
lll make the rep ort public.
G ot it?
- C ome, Sir. - C ome, Sir. Lets resume.
Oh, y ou finished y our tea, already?
This meeting is  over.
Why d on 't y ou say what happened?
l mean, y ou had the
pe oples resp onsibility  on y ou.
That was the g overnment
we were speaking with.
But, dammit, y our
attitude was s o aut ocratic!
What did Balram Singh say t o y ou?
A red car passed this way.
Did y ou see it?
N o sir, l did n ot.
Wh o else is  on duty here?
- Sir, there 's Ratan Singh. - Call him.
Ratan...
Sh ow me y our L og b o ok.
L o ok at this! Akki 's design.
And, the appreciati on fr om
Nati onal Engineers Ass ociati on.
An other fr om Pete Hubert,
the American design guru.
And that s on ofab#$ #
claims the design was faulty!
Y ou kn ow what the truth is?
This here is Akki 's
c onfidential rep ort t o the Chief Minister.
The w ork was illegally grabbed
fr om the designated c ompany...
by this Shiv Shakti.
Balram 's br other,
Sangram Singh 's c ompany.
And here, 2 days bef ore his accident
he writes that his rep ort was leaked...
and he was receiving threats.
Hence, he wanted t o resign.
He was referring t o this inquiry!
Every one 's guilty, Yasmin.
Fr om the Chief Minister t o
Balram and his br other, Sangram.
This entire Department...
We need t o answerjust  one
questi on t o link it all up.
Wh o  ordered Akhilesh 's death?
Stay here, sir.
lll have a l o ok.
A pint, please.
Sir.
N o...
l didn 't see anything, sir.
l didn 't see anything, sir.
n ot a thing Sir.
Y our bike was here.
And an other bike was f oll owing y ou.
N o sir...
That Sangram Singh...
Hell kill me, sir.
Sangram Singh will kill me Sir.
Please save me, sir.
Where is this Chh otelal?
He 's with us.
Safe.
S orry ab out the tragedy.
But believe me, this rep ort wasn 't
deliberately fr om the CM 's  office.
Deliberately  or  otherwise...
the resp onsibility lies with the
office t o which Akhilesh sent the rep ort.
Yes, l understand that.
But the pe ople y ou refer t o
are als o in this g overnment.
lsn 't t o o difficult t o  obtain
a c opy  of c onfidential papers.
What 're y ou trying t o say?
Rem ove the CM 's name
fr om this c ontr oversy!
lll take acti on against Sangram Singh.
Y ou l o ok s o hands ome s on.
Greetings.
Br other, t oday l will want
a special gift fr om y ou!
Happy Birthday. Be happy!
Thank y ou, br other, thank y ou.
Welc ome, welc ome, DGP.
Even y ou have c ome
t o say Happy Birthday!
What 's this?
Gift!?
Arrest warrant f or Sangram Singh!
Warrant?
What?
What 's the charge?!
Murder!
Of engineer Akhilesh Anand.
What n onsense!
The p olice inquiry cleared me.
lts the c ourts warrant, Sangram.
They 've bypassed the p olice.
G o with them.
This y our special birthday gift.
T oday is his birthday! At least t oday...
En ough.
Wh o is behind this?
Mr. Chief Minister.
The H ome Ministers
br other is in the d ock.
lts the g overnments
m oral resp onsibility...
S o, Balram Singh accepted
the m oral resp onsibility!
He handed  over his inn ocent
br other t o the c ops  on his birthday!
What m ore d o y ou want?
T oday is the last day  of the
deadline issued by the Pe oples M ovement!
Y our G overnment...
L o ok...
Our stand is clear.
Very respectfully, we
invited them f or a meeting.
But, their attitude was dictat orial.
The pe ople  of Ambikapur have been
brainwashed by these s o-called activists.
The g overnment is run by
pe oples representatives...
n ot by m obs!
lts clear that th ose...
wh o run g overnment have a l ofty visi on.
They just d on 't want t o see d own here.
F or them there isn 't any pr oblem at all!
As far as l am c oncerned...
N ot  one step has been taken
t o clear th ose th ousands...
of applicati ons stuck in their files.
And, that is isn 't
g oing t o happen! Ever!
Rejecting the Rs. 2.5
milli on c ompensati on made...
n o difference t o y our life, did it?
My husband died in
that fly over accident...
leaving these tw o pups f or me t o feed.
The g overnment pr omised me Rs. 100000.
After m onths  of eff orts, the  official
agreed t o charge 40000 t o release it.
N ow, this campaign  of
y ours ab orted that t o o.
The  officials taunt me
t o rec over it fr om y ou!
Y ou will never understand...
the pain  of hunger.
When l 'm sick, these tw o starve.
They cry silently in the night.
Frankly, y our m ovement
has ruined  our lives!
lf this w oman and her
children g o hungry...
l have n o right t o eat either.
Starting t oday, n ow...
l will fast indefinitely. Unt o death.
Until the g overnment...
fulfills  our demands.
My decisi on is final!
S ome one has lit the flaming t orch
We were inn ocent but
n ow have been pr ov oked
S ome one has lit the flaming t orch
We were inn ocent but

T otal farce!
lts a picnic! The c op orates are dishing

S ong and dance and fun in full swing.
But, f or the w orld, fast unt o death!
This isn 't a pr otest.

C ome, sit next t o me.
Sit with me.
Okay...
if y ou insist, l will eat.
But...
y ou 'll have t o guarantee me  one thing.
Hencef orth, y our kids...

Give me that guarantee,
and lll eat right n ow.
H ow can l...?
Precisely!
That 's why we are  on a hunger-strike.
s o that  our children...
never have t o sleep hungry.
C ome  on here, sit with me.
As time g oes  on, l

Greetings, Mr. Manav.
We were always keen t oj oin y ou.
But y ou-
Never mind then.
T oday, l want t o help y ou.
l d on 't understand...
But l can understand...
ln spite  of such a massive
m ovement against the g overnment...
why is the main  opp ositi on
party n ot expl oiting that?
Our supp ort is y ours!
But  only fr om  outside.
What is this, Mr. Manav!
This is like getting
married with out pleasure  of l ove!
We will j oin with y ou
n ot just in statements...
but als o  on the gr ound.
Only then will the g overnment m ove!
S o, this was the deal
y ou struck last night!
N ow, this fundamentalist
party will run  our m ovement?
C 'm on, Yasmin.
D on 't  overreact.
Our m ovement needs supp ort n ow.
l d on 't care where it c omes fr om!
Manav, they play the
p olitics  of c ommunalism and hatred.
They 'll hijack the wh ole m ovement.
And, wear the cr own  of vict ory as well.
But, we w ont let that happen.
lt will be the pe oples vict ory.
M ore over, what
difference d oes credit make.
Big difference, Manav!
Remember.
F or us the means are
as imp ortant as the end.
Why d on 't y ou say this t o that w oman
wh o sends her kids t o bed hungry every night?
Or t o my friend,
Akhilesh, wh o l ost his life?
Y ou cant get
em oti onal and make judgments.
Why n ot?
l j oined this m ovement
only f or em oti onal reas ons.
F or this stubb orn  old man...
wh o is sacrificing his life
because  of an uncaring g overnment.
And y ou think he 'd appr ove
of these fundamentalists?
L o ok, that 's my resp onsibility,  okay?
lll d o whatever it
takes t o end his fast.
lf they d on 't have the
guts t o pass the Ordinance...
call f or an emergency
sessi on  of the Assembly.
Well supp ort it.
Pe oples instructi ons sh ould be f oll owed.
Pe ople are the rulers.
N ot  obeying them is an
insult  of dem ocracy.
Really?!
What is this, Mr. Balram!
Y ou are cancelling my
bridge-c ontract with out a n otice!
Mr. Gauri, relax. Chill. Please sit.
The n otice is simply since the
w ork wasn 't c ompleted in time.
Wh ose w ork is ever
c ompleted in time, tell me.
With this excuse, we
g ot t o meet at least.
What 'll y ou have: tea  or c offee??
First take the n otice back.
Ok taken.
Sit d own.
Tea  or c offee?
C offee.
This is y our file...
pers onal as well as business.
S o many c omplaints
ab out pr ojects, scams.
Fit f or CBl. But, l 've
suppressed everything.
Y ou w ont get a single n otice.
Rest in peace.
Where am l speaking against y ou either?
l trust y ou...
N o  one wants t o
diss olve the g overnment...
every one fr om the CM d ownwards has
their pr oject-investments in the pipeline.
They 'll all c ome t o n ought.
Y ou will g o bankrupt!
l have always c o operated with y ou.
But, y our alliance partners?
H ow will y ou shut them up?
l shall request them.
They will be managed.
Y ou kn ow me.
Right?
Mr. Gauri Shankar...
why have y ou withdrawn y our
supp ort t o the Jan Satyagraha m ovement?
L o ok, l o ok. l always supp ort the pe ople.
H owever, laws can  only
be made in the Assembly.
They cant happen  on the
streets n ow, can they?
Hell o Mr. Kalikant.
Yasmin, can y ou put an end t o
Dwarka Anand 's hunger strike?
l d on 't understand...
He has very clearly stated
that until the pe ople 's...
L o ok, can y ou end it  or n ot?
N ot till y ou fulfill the
demands  of the pe ople. N o.
We 've received a letter.
Dad, lndr ojeet is here.
Daduji...
Read it al oud.
The G overnment wants
t o discuss  our demands.
And they request y ou t o end y our fast.
Uncle, n othing will make every one
happier than y ou breaking y our fast.
See...
En ough  of p olitics, sir.
Please get t o the p oint.
Were ready t o discuss every p oint.
Just get this fast br oken.
Y ou bring in the  ordinance.
The fast will break by itself.
With out the cabinets appr oval,
the  ordinance cant..
l have the CM 's appr oval.
l give y ou my pers onal guarantee that
the g ovt will bring in the  ordinance.
lt c ould take s ome time.
Just get Daduji 's fast br oken.
C ome, lets address the media t ogether.
W ow! A terrific party is g oing  on!
But, y ou f org ot t o invite me.
Mr. Balram, this meeting
was called in a hurry.
Mr. Kalikant, l h ope the hurry
d oesn 't untie the c ords  of  our alliance.
These are difficult times, Mr. Balram.
We need t o find a
s oluti on t o reach a c ompr omise.
C ompr omise!?
With these blackmailers?
Mister Dadu 's fast is just a big farce.
Hey...
D on 't y ou dare utter a
w ord against Daduji!
Have a l o ok! The
vi olence  of peaceful activists!
lll sh ow y ou s ome vi olence!
Jump and dance as much as y ou want!
But this c oaliti on g overnment cant
make any law with out my c onsent.
The law will be made, Balram Singh!
Because the y outh  of t oday has seen
thr ough criminal p oliticians like y ou.
And, f orget the c ords  of the alliance.
l will strip y ou naked such...
that even if y ou beg,
y ou w ont get a single v ote.
Y our days are numbered.
Well drag y ou thr ough the gutters.
That is a pr omise!
Sir...
Nice lecture!
But it is l wh o gets a hearing in
the legislative assembly. N ot y ou!
lmp otent, each  one  of them.
Be that as it may...
we cant l ose uncle in their p olitics.
N ow matter h ow, well have
t o get him t o end his fast.
lt is  obvi ous that the g overnment
will n ot c omply with  our demands.
Perhaps they d on 't care ab out Daduji.
But we d o.
l have a pr op ositi on t o
make  on behalf  of y ou all.
That Daduji break his fast.
We will figure  out
an other way t o pressurize them.
Our m ovement will...
Daduji... L ong live...
l am grateful t o y ou all...
Y our c oncern.
Y our l ove and faith...
will lead us t o  our g oal.
But...
n ow we cann ot step back.
l will c ontinue my indefinite fast.
l am within y ou all...
and y ou all are within me.
l will be lucky if l die f or this cause.
L ong live Daduji.
Daduji, this g overnment
w ont give us anything.
We will die, but they w ont care!
We will sh ow the g overnment, Daduji.
All hail Daduji.
St op him...
St op him.
Call the ambulance.
Manav.
Daduji has d one s o much f or us...
that l can even give my life.
Oh G od.
His name was Lalbahadur.
The pe ople want a
public funeral pr ocessi on.
See, with out the g overnments
appr oval l cann ot permit this.
He was very brave...
We will have a public pr ocessi on.
H ow c ould y ou even
think  of all owing this!
Lalbahadur did this
in a fit  of passi on...
but by calling him a martyr...
we will enc ourage such a mentality.
This is a very danger ous step.
Y ou aren 't reading the public m o od.
Pe ople are furi ous.
This is h ow they 'll
make the g overnment react.
Yasmin, the decisi on was the pe oples.
Y ou believe in dem ocracy, right?
C onduct a p oll  of these th ousands here.
Dem ocracy d oesn 't
mean a m obs v ote, Arjun.
Fine.
l pr op ose that we take the
opini on  of  our entire c ommittee.
Their  opini on is here, bef ore y ou.
N o, Manav...
We d on 't have Daduji 's  opini on yet.
l d on 't c onsider it
appr opriate t o disturb him in his state.
l guess this was inevitable.
lt 's been  obvi ous f or a while n ow...
that y our views and decisi ons are
assumed t o be the c ommittees  opini on.
But t oday l want t o register my
opp ositi on, even if l am al one.
C ongratulati ons.
l pray that y ou d on 't ever have
t o regret this decisi on  of y ours.
Why cant she understand?
Pe ople are shaken up.
lf they c ome  out  on the streets,
it will bring public pressure  on the g overnment.
Else, Uncles fast will...
Y ou bl o ody g overnment d og!
They 're behaving like
its a wedding party.
He 's here t o dance at
a Martyr 's m ourning.
Take it easy!
Were  on duty here.
Yeah right! Duty, indeed!
Slimy bl o ody c op!
En ough is en ough, Chief Minister!
l had asked y ou n ot t o
all ow this pr ocessi on.
N ow, Ambikapur is burning.
And, if l g o d own, lll take y ou with me.
l 'm sending in the paramilitary!
Sign it.
Sign it... please.
N ot behind me.
G o bl ock that way.
Y ou pe ople c ome here.
D on 't let any one in!
P olice and CRPF are here t o pr otect y ou.
D on 't take the law
int o y our  own hands...
else we will deal with it firmly.
Gather y our pe ople.
We need t o c ontr ol the situati on.
The situati on is
c ompletely in  our c ontr ol, Manav.
All the r oads have been bl ocked.
We w ont let the CRPF  or the
p olice enter this city t oday.
N o matter what!
Arjun, vi olence is n ot  our way!
There 'll be l ot  of bl o odshed!
S o be it, Manav.
What 's left n ow?.
Pe ople are sick  of this g overnment.
lts d o  or die t oday.
We will sh ow that bl o ody
Balram Singh that we aren 't c owards.
Using the military
against his  own pe ople!!
D on 't be crazy, Arjun!!
Daduji will wish f or this
m ovement t o bec ome vi olent.
Y ou take care  of Daduji, Manav!
Y ou d o that!
Let 's g o.
lts this way  or that way!
Or else t o the grave!
Manav, please c ome fast.
l d on 't kn ow where Babuji has g one!
What d o y ou mean?
l d on 't kn ow. N o  one saw him!
l d on 't kn ow where Babuji has g one!
Where are y ou g oing, Yasmin?
l am leaving this t own.
Please, Yasmin. N ot n ow.
l need y ou here.
l can 't help y ou, Manav.
l w on 't be able t o st op
this cha os with out y our help.
N o  one can st op it n ow, Manav.
After all, every one believes
that it has y our appr oval.
This wasn 't my intenti on, Yasmin!
But l accept my mistake.
Right n ow, we have an emergency.
Uncle is missing.
Oh my G od.
l will l o ok f or him.
Y ou please try and c onvey t o the
pe ople n ot t o fight the p olice!
St op!
Where are y ou g oing?
St op!
Where are y ou g oing?
St op!
Sir, Dwarka is right here.
Give me the  order Sir.
Finish him.
Please st op.
Uncle...
N o...
Uncle...
Sir, l have b oth Manav
and Dwarka at gunp oint.
Kill them!
N o... st op.
St op... L o ok.
Manav...
l killed b oth  of them.
Hey... Bulbul.
Catch him.
L o ok, he was talking
t o the H ome Minister.
- Father! - S omeb ody call an ambulance!
N o... it will be t o o late.
Bef ore w ord spreads...
My message...
Hurry up.
l have very little time.
Please, Father.
St op this vi olence...
St op this vi olence...
Or, l will die thinking...
that l made a mistake by
starting this m ovement!
What kind  of nati on have we made!
Where leaders wh o run the
g overnment have disc onnected fr om us.
They refuse t o even hear us  out.
What kind  of nati on have we made!
Peace...
Daduji...
Arrest Balram Singh...
And withdraw all the
paramilitary f orces fr om Ambikapur.
Sir!
He 's disappeared, sir!
Seal his h ouse!
Please st op.... st op.
Please st op.
He 's n ot g oing anywhere!
Hand him  over t o us!
We will d ojustice here! N ow!!
lf Balram Singh is n ot handed
over t o us, Ambikapur will burn!
Arjun...
Ambikapur will burn!
- C ome t o y our sense, Arjun. - l 'm very much in my
senses, Manav.
He hurt the pe ople.
N ow, they will punish him!
Bl o od f or bl o od!
Just leave it t o us!
Well deal with this. And
with the law and the g overnment.
Bl o od f or bl o od!
That 'll be wr ong!
Against Daduji 's principles.
Well figure  out this
principles business later, Manav.
Shut up!!
D on 't st op us t oday, Manav.
lf he escapes punishment,
well regret it permanently.
N o, Arjun.
l d on 't want us t o repeat the same
mistake that c ost Daduji his life!
lt isn 't that my bl o od isn 't b oiling.
l feel like tearing him limb fr om limb.
But, that w ould be madness!
The anger  of us y outh
is entirely legitimate.
Were this c ountry 's
greatest strength and h ope.
And this anger has s o
much strength that...
if it transf orms int o a rev oluti on,
it can upr o ot the str ongest system.
Hence, d on 't waste
this anger in revenge.
Nurture it, and build y our future!
D on 't f orget with what difficulty...
giving up their essential things,
our parents educated us.
Made us capable, s o that
we can make  our future.
But, if the c ountry 's future is in
darkness, h ow can  ours be bright?
That 's why we have t o change p olitics.
Arjun, n ot fr om  outside...
but by participating in it.
With a gr oup  of y oung pe ople, f orm a
party  on the principles  of  our m ovement.
Well all supp ort y ou.
Then let us see h ow the dividers...
and l o oters  of this
c ountry c ontinue their business!
Well keep Dadu alive! Amidst us!
And, never let this flame die  out!
