I'm going back to work.
Don't worry, I checked her out.
Scenario:
Agent falls in love with girl.
Agent runs an op.
Girl gets kinapped.
The other guys want to know the agent's source.
What does he do?
What do they do to the girl? Hmm?
- Is there a point to this?
- Yeah.
Over your right shoulder.
- Us or them?
- How the fuck should I know?
Does it really matter?
You feel the need for a relationship... get a dog.
Channel four.
Ah, shit.
Mason, give us a hand with this, mate, will you?
You want me to put your corsage on, too, Miss Prom Queen?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sit on this and twist.
You're funny.
Hanley.
Right.
We've got 20 minutes.
You ready?
Mason, you ready?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.
Com check. One, two.
- Good hunting.
- Copy.
Hi, there.
Ambassador, I'm gonna' need your clothes.
We believe there may be an attempt
on your life this morning.
Target is male.
Caucasian. 35 to 40.
You want to bet your life on that?
No.
I'm betting on you.
This is it, Peter.
I'm in the yellow building, green shutters,
next to the clock tower.
How many potentials?
Too many.
I don't like it.
Call off the op.
We don't have the coverage.
We're not calling this op.
Body armor is not going to stop a
headshot.
Been having these headaches, anyway.
Blue suit. Two o'clock.
Got 'em.
He's moving.
Hold your shot.
Hold your shot.
Check your line of fire.
Don't shoot.
- No, he's moving on you.
- DO NOT SHOOT!
Devereaux?
Ah! Jesus...
He tagged you. I had to hit him.
What the hell was I supposed to do?
Learn to take orders!
No, no, no!
Lausanne, Switzerland. 5 years later.
Peter, there is a man outside by the water.
He says he knows you.
That's it?
No hello, Hanley.
Good to see you?
- Been a long time?
- You're still out of Berlin?
Berlin? Christ, no.
The action's moved, my friend.
Now front line is now in Belgrade.
You look good.
Better than him, at least.
- Cargen?
- Retirement got him fat.
- Not her, though.
- Oh, God.
Craig.
They knew the risks.
We all did.
We ID'ed the killer.
Alexa Demoistria.
Contract killer out of Moscow.
She's cutting a swath through people who have
no business dying.
Agency thinks it's Arkady Federov killing anyone or
anything that reminds him of his past.
The guy's going to be the next
Russian president.
What's this got to do with me?
Natalia.
We'd be proud of her, Peter.
After you left, she got very close to
Fedorov.
But she wants to come in.
She has something on him.
Something that's scaring even her.
- What?
- A name.
Claims it changes everything.
And if she's right...
How long before you think she's going to
join these?
You go in. You get her out.
Moscow to Petersburg.
Cross the border to Helsinki...
I'll meet you there.
She asked for you.
Only you.
She won't give you the name
until you bring her out, right?
She always was a ball-buster.
The Duma, Moscow.
Drone's airbourne.
Exfil on standby.
Monitoring...
[ Begins speech in Russian ]
United States Embassy.
Belgrade, Serbia.
- Do we have a link to the drone?
- Yes we do.
Rendezvous with the extraction team in...
4 minutes.
We have eyes on the prize.
Traveling northbound on Tverskaya.
5 minutes.
Message recieved from prize,
We are 5 minutes from exfil.
Langley's online.
What time is it there, Perry?
You don't need to be in on this one.
If our girl's actually got something on Fedorov
a lot of people are interested.
Subject's nearing extraction location.
Sir, we have an issue.
- Who?
- It looks like FSB.
Get in the car!
Peter, why are you here?
Who's car is that she got into?
Whoever it is, it's not us.
How is Lucy? Hmm?
She misses you.
I miss her, too.
Both of you.
We're tracking from parallel streets.
Plotting intercept location...
Tverskoy Boulevard.
Belgrade Control, send 42.
Mason's got the ball.
No. Perry, you can't!
Belgrade Control, send 42.
Mason's got the ball.
- Op One.
- Copy.
42. Confirm?
42 confirmed.
You have a name.
I need it.
Right now! I need the name!
Mira Filipova.
- Yes?
- Mira Filipova.
Mira Filipova.
Peter, you're blown.
42 complete.
Oh, sh...
Peter.
She was one of ours, Weinstein.
It was over when the Russians made her.
We did her a favor.
Go! Go! Get out!
I've tapped into a CCTV feed...
- What the hell is going on?
- Op One, this is Control. Respond.
What happened?
Op Two, respond.
It was Devereaux.
It was God-damned Devereaux.
What was he doing here?
Who is Devereaux?
Peter Devereaux, one of ours.
Active '77 to '08.
Used to work with Hanley.
I'm on the next plane there.
Bring Mason in.
[Airport]
Mira Filipova.
Go! Go! Go!
Stop him!
- Oh, Smokey.
- I think this belongs to you.
Come here, you dumb cat.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
She spends so much time in my
apartment, she should pay some rent.
She likes you better than me.
Would you come in for a cup of
coffee?
I just made some.
Tastes like home.
Sorry, work.
Hello?
Hi, I'm looking Alice Fournier.
Alice!
Can I help you?
Yes. Hello, my name is Edgar Simpson. I'm an
investigative journalist.
I work with the New York Times.
I want to talk to you about this man.
Arkady Fedorov.
He's a Russian politician.
I'm researching a story on him.
Hello, I have reservation.
No.
Why didn't you shoot?
Here.
Why didn't you shoot?
Yes, Mr. Mason.
Why didn't you shoot?
There is no threat, sir.
The man who just assassinated your entire team
is pointing a gun at you
and you say there was no threat?
Devereaux was disoriented.
He didn't expect to see me there
He was doing exactly what I
would have done.
We tried to kill him.
He killed us.
You gleaned all this in less than 2 seconds?
Yes, sir.
The question remains...
Why didn't you shoot?
Why didn't he shoot?
You think you know Devereaux?
Just let me find him.
If I talk to him,
maybe I could stop this from getting crazy.
You don't know him.
I know how he trained you.
No connections.
But there were things in this world
that mattered to Peter Devereaux.
People he let inside.
People he loved, perhaps.
And we just killed a very important one.
And now, he'll come after us.
With everything he's got.
That's how he's wired.
He killed three of our people.
The call is to terminate Devereaux.
Do you have a problem
with the call?
I do what I'm told to do, sir.
Hard drive's okay.
- I think I've got something here.
- What do you got?
It's what we're looking for.
It's the last search that Hanley ran.
See what else you can find.
- Ugh.
- Everything's a real mess.
What a clusterfuck.
Hi. How are you doing?
I've got some stuff for you.
Look. This girl - Mira -
arrives Belgrade late 90s, UN refugee, she's
processed by these two..
Then handed off to a social worker.
This woman, Alice Fournier.
Two or three other girls were friends...
No... prostitutes, junkies.
Last trace of your Mira was a decade ago.
If she was anything like her friends,
she's probably dead.
Give me her.
Here you go...
She has lunch plans.
Dva Jelena restaurant.
You're very welcome.
Biometric match from Belgrade Airport
arrivals coming up.
This is four hours ago.
There.
He looked right at the camera.
- Yeah?
- I have the crew from Hanley's.
They have something.
Cleaners at Hanley's have a possible hit.
Authorization and access codes positive.
Go ahead.
Yes, this Yorgan.
I need location information on a subject:
Fournier.
Alice. Cell number: 75365423.
Search the location of this cellphone.
Fournier, Alice.
Cell 75365423.
Current location: Skadarska 32
I believe that's a restaurant.
Thank you.
How many on station at Hanley's?
Two.
Call the other one.
There's no answer.
It's Devereaux.
Thank you for deciding to meet with me.
Please, sit down.
I won't stay long. Thank you.
- Would you like something?
- Um... water's fine.
Thanks.
So... let's talk about Arkady Federov.
In the work I do, it's a name I hear a lot.
But he's old news.
Atrocities are like reality TV.
There's always some new show
for people to forget.
Agreed. However, now Federov is about to
become President of Russia. That makes him
a person of interest.
To the world and to my publication.
And when Federov was just a General, I'd say
he was pretty much untouchable
But it is different now.
He's vulnerable.
What?
You don't think that makes him
dangerous?
These guys always talk a big game
but, at the end of the day, they are
mostly men
who just like the sound of their
own voices.
You want your story and your
Pulitzer Prize, huh?
You haven't seen what they're like
when they come to us.
Many are just girls, frightened girls.
Have you thought about what your story
might do to them?
There are crimes Federov is guilty of.
He needs to be exposed.
Now, if the girls from your center are willing
to talk to me, to tell me their stories...
I help the victims.
I don't use for politics.
These girls have been through enough.
I'm sorry.
Maybe your heart's in the right
place, but nobody can stop Federov.
If you've agreed to meet with me,
there must be some way you can help me.
- Excuse me, are you Alice Fournier?
- Yes.
There is a call for you in the office.
They say your cell phone is not working.
This way. Please.
Excuse me.
- Yes, Hello?
- Stop. Stay right where you are.
Listen to me very carefully.
Woman with you is a killer. If she
panics, you're a dead woman.
Turn around. I'm right behind you.
Turn around.
Run!
Now! Run!
Alice!
Out the back!
I want eyes on them!
Come on!
Come on!
Move!
Who are you? What's happening?
Side door.
He's got to be in the market.
I want eyes on him right now.
Mason.
I can't believe you've still got
the same phone number. How's it going?
Actually, I'm a little busy right now.
Can I call you back in a few minutes?
Get the cell scanner.
No, let's just talk, shall we?
You can keep doing what you are doing,
I don't mind.
Scenario: Hard target with a female accomplice
took a 30 second lead on me
into a crowded venue.
Mmm-hmm. Tell me about your target.
Male. Old.
- He used to have skills.
- Used to?
Yeah, he probably thinks he still does.
Yeah. But he's arrogant, confident he'll evade.
He's already made his first mistake.
You really think six agents are gonna' do it?
Hmm? Tell me.
Devereaux...
- Who were those men? Were they police?
- No.
...sort of.
Then who the hell are you?
Who are you? What do you want?
Let go of me!
-Shhh!
- What's happening? I didn't do anything.
- I believe you
but they won't. Now, if you want to
walk out of here, you're going to have
to trust me.
Okay?
Alice?
Wait!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- I knew you'd call back.
- You're losing your perimeter.
Too many bodies moving.
You're losing control.
Don't you want to know why I was in Moscow?
What my orders were? Who sent me?
Keep him talking.
Why don't you come in, Devereaux,
we'll talk about it.
No. This is my scenario.
I make the rules.
Come on, kid. Just give me enough to
keep it interesting.
- Maybe I'll make the mistake.
You owe me that much.
- I don't owe you shit!
- J, give me your phone.
- Where am I?
Come on, Mason. Where am I?
The call is being broadcast through this phone.
The scaner thinks Jake's phone
is Devereaux's phone.
That's why he seems so close.
How many people have you killed, Mason?
What? Now?
Or in the next five minutes?
You think about it sometimes?
Maybe having a coffee? Or a screw?
Or see a beautiful woman, or a child.
Then remember all the lives you've
taken.
That way.
- It stops you cold, doesn't it?
- No, asshole. I sleep like a baby.
Y'know, I don't get you Devereaux.
I'm the one you want. Why not take your shot?
Tempting.
Give away my position, though .
Always willing to die for the cause,
eh, Mason?
- Fear is the enemy. You taught me that.
- Yeah. Well I haven't finished teaching you yet, son.
- And here I am about to take you down all the same.
- You're not going to take me down, kid.
You're a blunt instrument at best.
No perspective. No knowledge.
- Keep talking, old man.
- This is humiliating.
Embarrassing.
Just like in Moscow. Hmm?
What is it, Mason.
No one there to hold your hand?
No one there to tell you to pull the trigger.
- He's stealing a car. Where's the nearest
parking lot?
- There's one straight ahead this way.
- So no regrets.
- Not one.
You know what? I don't give a fuck about
the people I've killed.
If by some stroke of pure luck, you
manage to kill me
then I won't give a fuck about that, either.
He's here. He's around here somewhere.
- That was quite a speech.
- You bring out the best in me.
Gas. Get back!
Get back! Get back!
- Mira Filipova. Where is she?
- How do you know that name?
When was the last time you saw her?
I don't know... maybe three years ago.
I was her case worker.
A good friend of mine died
trying to find her.
I'm sorry.
I have no idea where he is.
The woman who approached you at the
restaurant, she was a professional killer.
Russian.
The men on the motorbikes were CIA.
- CIA?
- Now, whatever that girl knows
a lot of people want it.
And if they can't find her,
You're the next closest thing.
Do you have files on the women you help?
Yes.
We're going to catch this tram.
Why do you hate him so much?
The man who wants to kill us...
Why do you hate him?
I don't hate him.
No.
He's probably the best friend
I've ever had.
So, all your friends try to kill you?
Eventually.
Where can I find her?
- I told you I don't know.
- You must know something.
Friends, places she frequented...
people don't just disappear.
I do not know, okay.
In my line of work, yes,
yes they do. They disappear.
One day you think they're there,
the next they're just gone.
She stopped coming to meetings.
People said she was using, doing tricks.
Do you know who this man is?
A pimp.
He brings girls in from the Caucasus,
sells them for sex.
His name is Liebe Denko.
No. His real name is Simeon Denisof.
He was Federov's right-hand man during the
last Chechen conflict.
Do you know where he is right now?
Yes.
He's here, in Belgrade.
How do you know Denisof?
Just people you meet.
I want to see Liebe Denko.
No.
Just tell him Peter Devereaux is here.
Wait.
- You look like shit.
- Yeah? Well, you don't look too good yourself.
You're welcome.
I can't believe it.
So... why are you here, Peter?
I want information.
Someone is here in Belgrade to kill you,
and it's not me.
I could tell you who it is, but...
I want something in return.
Okay. You tell me.
I go into your debt.
For old time's sake.
Arkady Federov. He's killing just about
everyone who was close to him from your
Good Old Days...
- Now my information is that he's
going to try and kill you.
- Me?
- Yeah.
So what's his deal?
Why does he want to have a clean slate now?
What's his game?
Turn around. You should turn
around just now.
Chechnya.
This ugly, dirty little God-forsaken
country. Oil, however. Lots of it.
Filthy Chechen terrorists didn't
want to give it to us.
So, one day a building...
blew up.
Good Russian soldiers with Mommies and Daddies
back at home get sent back in peices.
And just like that, Federov got his dirty little war.
And Mother Russian got
its oil.
- You dropped the building?
- Nah. Federov was smart enough to know
that he couldn't handle an operation like that,
keep it a secret.
We ran it for you?
All we did was sit back
and watch everybody die.
Would you like some water?
Sorry about the treatment.
If it makes a difference, I
argued against it.
You ran Peter Devereaux from 1998.
Until his retirement in 2008.
On April 17th of this year,
you went to Lausanne under the name Sanders.
And re-activated him.
Show me your tits.
- Excuse me?
- I assume that's why Weinstein sent you,
isn't it?
It certainly isn't for your acumen.
Fuck you!
You like being on top?
Working your way up the ladder?
I like the other guys better.
Where the fuck are the other guys!
- This room is sound-proof.
- You don't think I know that?
I approved the use and design of this facility.
I wrote the manual you're going by.
I know how long until you switch
operational procedure.
You stupid twat.
You may know the procedure, but then you also
know that I have the right to vary the procedure,
if I deem it neccessary.
Based on the tenor of this conversation
I am inclined to vary the procedure.
"You know what? I don't give a fuck about
the people I've killed."
"If by some stroke of pure luck, you
manage to kill me, then I won't
give a fuck about that, either."
"- That was quite a speech."
"- You bring out the best in me."
- Not exactly accurate, that last statement you made.
- Keeping him engaged was an advantage, sir.
Yes, to him.
I don't know if he's too in your head.
Maybe you're mad 'cause you never had a daddy
I don't know, and frankly I don't care.
He played you for a fool.
- I'll get him.
- Will you?
It doesn't feel that way from here, son.
From here it feels like you're busy
trying to please him.
- What? You still admire the man?
- I did.
Well, here's what he thought of you.
Hey you. Hey...
How'd you get in here?
All she wants is to be at your place.
My God, you're an ungrateful bitch.
Mommy's gonna' turn you into a handbag.
Okay, then.
Okay, then?
What is that?
We've been passing each other on the stairs
for eight weeks.
Who are you anyway?
I mean, sure you're mildy attractive,
and mysterious, but... it gets kind of
tired after a while, y'know?
I mean.. I don't even know your
name.
David.
Well, I'm Sarah.
Did you ever think that maybe Mira is
better where ever she is?
Your girl witnessed Federov and a CIA agent
conspire to start a war that killed hundreds
of thousands of people.
So... whoever gets to her first
owns Federov. And believe me,
Someone will find her.
C'mon.
What it must be like to be you...
Take what you want,
do as you please.
What happens if they come back?
We leave.
There you go.
That'll do.
Bottoms up.
What happened in Moscow?
Something...
unfortunate.
What was her name?
Natalia.
Will killing him really make it better?
It's a start.
Why did you save me?
Don't put your faith in me, Alice.
I promise...
I'll disappoint you.
Satie.
What did you say?
..."My Favorite" in Russian.
- You speak Russian?
- Yes.
My parents were university professors.
They taught me.
I found some clothes that should fit you.
What if they find Mira before you do?
Then no one will need you.
Your problems will be over.
- They'll kill her, won't they?
- Yes.
- What if no one ever finds her?
- No one can hide forever.
I can't bring you with me where I have
to go now.
So I can't protect you anymore. Go
somewhere where no one can find you,
not even me. Use only cash,
and wait for this to ring.
Sara?
Sara?
Sara?
- David?
- I'm here. It's alright.
Everything's going to be alright.
He won't hurt you. You understand?
- Let her go.
- Let her go.
Then you? What?
Bullets start bouncing around?
Tell him he needs to listen.
- Tell him.
- You need to listen.
You know what he's doing, don't you?
He's trying to decide what you're worth.
He will not hurt you.
He still hasn't decided. Ask him.
Ask him if you're worth saving.
Am I worth saving?
He's not answering your question
is he?
You need to make him answer
your question!
- Am I worth saving?
- Yes!
You are.
You like her, huh?
Yeah. Time to finish your training.
What the fuck can you teach me?
You gave up on me, remember?
- What did you want?
- I want to be better than you.
What does that mean?
To be better than me.
To be better at something? Hmm?
To be a better man?
Why did you drop me?
Oh...here it comes.
I took the shot. What was I supposed to do?
I had no choice.
There's always a choice.
Answer the fucking question!
You made the wrong choice.
I came here tonight, Mason, to kill you.
I did not know what she was to you.
Oh, you though this was about Natalia?
No, this is about you.
You can be a human.
Or a killer of humans, but not both.
Eventually one of those people
will extenguish the other one
All you have to do now, is just to show me.
- That it's not too late for you.
- Come on!
- No!
Second chance, Mason.
Scenario: Your target
has just severed the femoral artery
of a woman.
- No!
Has just severed the femoral artery
of a woman you have been intimate with
- What do you do?
- Let her go!
Fuck!
Lucilia, you want to know
what I did?
I know what you did Mr. Hanley,
we're discussing why.
You don't know what I did
or what I do.
Ergo, how the fuck could you possibly
comprehend why?
Let's start at the top.
Look, what do you think it is that we do
here at the agency?
- We collect information.
- No, information is useless.
That changes overnight. Knowledge isn't power.
People are power.
We collect people.
And if anyone's listening at Langley,
with half a brain in their head,
they know what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about the ownership
of Arkady Federov!
Are you listening?
Arkady Federov!
Edgar.
Alice, what are you doing here?
You alright?
What happened to you at the restaurant?
I decided to tell you everything I know
about Arkady Federov.
Come in.
You know he's in town right now,
the European Energy Conference.
Staying at the Imperia Hotel.
No, I didn't.
I'm surprised to see you.
Can I get you a drink?
A cup of coffee or something?
Ah... no, thank you.
That's my Wall Of Shame.
There were hundreds of girls that came
out of the conflict.
We're a small organization.
Let me get my dictaphone.
There was one girl, Mira.
Pretended she was a mute.
Federov liked her, kept her
close to him.
Like a pet.
Mason, David. Access code
3-9-0-4-2
- Get in the corner, you.
- Leave the poor girl alone.
What the fuck?!...
Natalia didn't expect to see
me at Moscow,
She didn't even know I was coming!
What did you do?
She was...these past few months
she was acting erratically.
- Analysts thought she was becoming...
- Bullshit!
It happens! So they decided
to pull her.
I couldn't get to her without
them knowing.
If she came to our side, she
was going to die.
Sending you was her only chance.
Why? Huh?
Why?
Agency suspected for years that Federov
started the war by dropping a
building on his own men
then blaming it on the
Chechen nationalists.
Then Natalia reaches out to me,
says she's got an eye witness
who will swear that Federov was involved.
We did it!
We did it.
- Who the fuck you been talking to?
- People you should have been talking to!
Who was her liason?
Now, don't fucking lie to me!
That same man
who picked up Natalia's Mayday to me.
The same man who ordered her extraction,
and the same man
who quarterbacked the hit on her.
Come in.
Devereaux has a daughter.
Her name's Lucy.
These pictures are from five years ago.
She'd be twelve by now.
Natalia Ulanov was her mother.
And Devereaux raises her.
When Devereaux was in Berlin,
he recruited Natalia and convinced her
to spy for us.
He had a whole goddamn family
hidden from all of us.
Mira can destroy Weinstein.
That's why he had Mason kill Natalia,
that's why he's going after Mira.
The girl wasn't a peasant, or a mute.
Both her parents were university professors.
She could speak English and Russian.
Everything that Federov said, she understood.
I'm here to see Liebe Denko.
Your bag.
Hands up, please.
Why are you here?
Peter Devereaux needs a big favor.
What do you got?
This woman, Alice Fournier...
Deceased. April 2005.
Cancer.
Well then, who's she? She was in the
restaurant with Devereaux.
I'll run a biometric match.
Welcome to Hotel Imperial.
- Peter?
- Mira? Where are you?
I'm going to visit Arkady Federov.
- I've made the decision to confront him.
- Mira, don't do this. Please.
He will kill you.
Don't do this, please.
Who are you?
I'm the gift from Simeon Denisof.
What's this for?
Okay. Upstairs.
Turn around.
Denisof is very generous.
- Get on the bed.
- I'd like to wash first.
I have an audio file match.
Label's been changed.
Border intake interview.
My name is Mira Filipova.
My parents were murdered by
the Russian General, Arkady Fedorov.
I survived.
Arkady Fedorov is in Belgrade right now
for an energy conference.
Find out where he's staying.
- You're not going to kill me.
- You're wrong.
No.
If you were, I'd already be dead.
You don't know what you're doing, do you?
This is for my family.
Oh my God.
Mira.
There's so many people who want me dead,
and yet here you are.
The angry little girl
who didn't know how to fuck.
- And now it talks.
- Shut up!
Okay, okay. Maybe you will kill me.
We will see.
But making you into a woman.
It is one of the sweetest memories
I carried with me.
[Crying]
Shut up!
Silent.
Did you forget who I am, huh?
Mira! Mira don't!
Don't do it!
- I want him to die.
- He will.
But once he tells the world what
he did.
Where's your phone?
Get it.
Go get it, now!
Start filming.
1999. You supported an American operation
to impersonate Chechen terrorist.
Who was the American agent who ran it?
You are sit on my shirt.
Mira, take this.
Shoot him if you have to.
You are not going to kill me.
That's for you to decide.
We're going to play a little game
I believe was invented in your country.
I'll ask you once more.
Who was the American agent?
I'll ask you again.
Was it Weinstein?
Come on!
Stairs!
You piece of shit!
Your odds are running out!
Who was the American agent?
Was it Weinstein?
Hanley.
John Hanley.
- Hanley?
- Yeah.
Was it this guy?
- The guy in the middle?
- No.
Peter, that's him.
- The bald guy.
- Yes.
Go.
Here you go, take this.
- Use the service elevator.
- What about you?
Check into the Hyatt Hotel.
If I don't turn up, go to the Dutch embassy.
Identify yourself and tell them everything.
Ask for assylum. Go.
Okay.
He's headed to the basement.
- Repeat that.
- He's got to be heading to the basement.
- Cover the back stairs.
- Traveling.
Where'd he go?
I do not know.
You go that way.
Check this out.
- Jesus!
- You need to see something.
Who was the American agent?
Was it Weinstein?
Hanley.
John.
- This is messed up.
- Hanley.
We're taking this to Weinstein right now.
You, stay.
Tits, back to your desk.
Sit.
You know who sits here?
Your boss sits here.
I'm sitting here.
So sit down.
Peter?
Thank God you're alive.
What happened?
You can disappear. I'll help you.
Name a city, I'll get you there.
I have contacts. People who can
help you start again.
People who can make sure you'll
never be found.
I'm not running ever again.
Running is better than dead.
Thank you Peter, for saving my life.
Letting you die was never an option.
Come on, we've got to get moving.
A lot has changed in a very short time.
What were you doing a week ago?
Living my life.
And what's in Peter Devereaux's life?
Simple things.
A home in Lausanne. A small business.
It's a cafe by a lake.
And a daughter.
Who never got to know her mother,
and who barely knows her father.
- What's her name?
- Lucy.
- She's twelve.
- Where is she now?
Waiting for her father to pick her
up from boarding school.
- Lucy?
- Never had you pegged for the father type, Peter.
That such a lovely little girl could
come from your DNA defies logic.
Really, you should say something.
I'll kill you.
If you hurt her, I'll you.
Funny thing, Peter...
turns out the keys to Federov
are worth more to Langley than any
qualms Weinstein had with my methods.
I'm running the show here now, Peter.
Weinstein's back in the States.
And he seemed surprised when they sent
him home.
But not as surprised as you
probably are right now.
Y'know, if it's any consolation,
it was your boy Mason who brought Lucy
in for me.
I just thought, well, you should be proud.
He did good, didn't he?
Found that soft underbelly.
Wasn't sure you had one.
Yeah.
The boy did good.
Okay, the Fortress. 8 AM. Where they play
chess. You bring me Mira, I'll give
you your daughter.
You're a weapon, Mason.
A damned good one.
I value that.
We got to get out of here right now.
Go to the train station, book three
tickets on the noon train to Junik.
The border there is weak.
- He doesn't want you, he wants me.
- We'll meet you there.
He does not want you, he wants me.
- We'll be there!
- And if you're not?
Then I guess I didn't make it.
They're gonna' kill us all.
How would it happen?
You don't feel anything.
How can you be so sure?
A bullet travels at over 4000
feet per second.
Four times faster than the speed
of sound.
The effect of that velocity is...
absolute.
You just...
cease to exist.
Just be there.
Please.
[Attention Please. The train from Cacak
is late by one hour]
You tell yourself no one's gonna' get hurt,
at least no one you care about.
You played it well, though.
Did I?
You know Federov's going to do
when he secures the Presidency?
Change the world.
Russia's going to join fucking NATO.
Why?
Because I got my hand so far up his
ass, I'm moving his lips.
I own him.
This is what we worked for all those years.
You know it is.
Yeah, I think I got something
for you here.
Yes. She's at train station, just
bought three tickets to Junik with
a credit card.
She should be there.
Thank you.
Do do you think, maybe...
just maybe, you might have crossed
the line with this.
A long time ago, my friend.
You'll need proof of life, of
course.
Hello.
- Your Father.
- Papa, is that you?
How are you doing, kiddo?
I know you're scared.
But everythings going to be
alright, I promise you.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
and tell you I love you more than
anything in this world.
I love you, too, Papa.
I'm sorry I wasn't there when
you needed me.
Okay.
Where's Mira Filipova?
Bus station.
Bus to Novi Sad. 9 AM.
Bus to Novi Sad. 9 AM.
Bring her in.
Jones, you go with him.
You misjudged the kid,
he's a survivor.
- Not like you.
- No.
You bring Mira in,
you have my word
You'll have your daughter back.
You know what we used to call you,
Peter?
The November Man.
Because after you passed through,
nothing lived.
Guess some things don't change.
- Bus station is that way.
- Shortcut.
Slow down.
- Slow the fucking car down!
- Seatbelt.
Stop the vehicle right now!
Wall.
- Mason, you ready?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Not one American life was lost
in that Chechen mess...
- Not one.
- You're right.
East versus West, fuck that.
From now, it's the civilized world
against the Goddamn Middle East.
Now that's a fight I can understand.
That's a fight we can win.
Don't you get it?
- Hanley.
- What?
- Why are you sweating?
- 'Cause it's fucking hot.
Excuse me, I'm still using
this station.
Thank you.
Where's Lucy?
You were supposed to bring her here
when it was done?
It is.
You just doomed us to
another decade of conflict!
- Of shit! I hope you know that!
- The thing is...
I like it this way.
Thank you.
Papa.
Where is she?
Where is she?
- Peter!
- There she is.
Let's catch the train, come on!
My name is Mira Filipova.
When I was 15 years old,
Arkady Federov murdered my family.
and held me captive for 2 years.
I was repeatedly abused by him.
During that time, I witnessed Fedorov
conspired with the CIA agent, John Hanley
to bomb a civilian building.
That bombing was the start of the
second Chechen war.
The revalations of Chechen refugee, Mira
Filipova rocked the political world
as evidence of a conspiracy
between Arkady Federov and a high-
ranking CIA official effectively ended
Arkady Federov's
candidacy for the Russian Presidency.
Russian Minister's office issued a
blank denial of all acusations as Arkady Federov
takes an extended leave from his office
while weighing his political options.
