It was night.
And it was war.
Sergeant Luusalmi.
2nd Lieutenant Vares.
How many of 'em?
Three or four,
give or take a few.
So many?
Ok, give me cover,
I'll get the flag.
Yellows are coming
through. Pissed off.
No problem.
I'll deal with them.
I got keys to
that house over there.
I don't wanna know.
C'mon, you'd like it too.
- Get your hands off me.
If I don't get into your pants,
I'll turn you in as a deserter.
Let me go. - C'mon.
Hey, what's going on?
- What?
The sergeant said let go.
Get fucked,
this is my jurisdiction.
Jurisdiction goes
to the guy with a gun.
A gun with an AFD.
Is this better?
Shit! That's a
court martial offence.
So is what you're doing.
Now fuck off or I'll
put a bullet in you.
This isn't over.
You ok? - Yes.
And you're my prisoner.
- You must be joking.
I'm not. Drop the
flag and your gun.
You're now a yellow
platoon prisoner.
I'm Jussi Vares:
passed only -
eight Faculty of Law
exams in six years.
Now I conduct confidential
investigations.
I do them for money
Goddamn it. You women.
Eeva was different.
She drank and talked like a man;
used her eyes like a woman.
Cr√®me de menthe and vodka.
Not for me, thanks.
I've had enough.
I was about to say that our lady
sergeant could drink like a man.
Here's to that.
No. I'm 100% hammered.
- I always go for 110%.
What else do you do
- besides drinking?
He's a private dick.
A gumshoe.
Bit like Philip Marlowe
or Mike Hammer.
You're not.
No. Don't.
Stop it, Vares. Hold it.
No problem.
I can take
being turned down.
This has nothing to do with you.
I'm sort of in love.
With another man.
I always know when
and how to step back.
It's a mess.
I backed my brother's loans.
He split. So now
I marry another scumbag.
A romantic money match.
And a honeymoon in
hicksville Paimio.
You said "in love".
That's the worst part.
Yeah. True romance.
I'm sorry.
You're a really nice guy.
You can crash on my couch.
No point in going
out into that rain.
No, I gotta go.
And then I drank to forget -
the woman
in the curse of booze.
I knew already that she was
in deeper than she could handle.
As I was.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The clock is ticking.
You're slacking off.
It's just not good
enough, lieutenant.
Goddamn it, Luusalmi.
You let yourself
sober up now and then.
Don't you have
a book you have to write?
Books are
born out of experience.
First you have to live,
then you write.
Luusalmi. A poor writer
but good drinker -
with the health of
a 40-year old barfly.
Like hell it will.
OK. Now what do we watch?
Videos.
What's on? Anything good?
How about that
fucking Travolta thing?
We've been
through this before.
Red-Eye Munck. Slow but clumsy.
No fear, no imagination.
Hyper-allergic and mentally
subnormal. Black rubber gloves.
We ain't watching that.
I don't get it.
The prick comes back
after he's wasted.
It's called a backslash.
Or backflash. Or something.
Fuck the backslacks.
It's now or never.
That's it. The end.
Tetsuo Sinkkonen. Father
an officer on a Jap freighter.
Does not eat sushi. Hockey
fan. White rubber gloves.
Hi sarge. - Hi.
How was the army?
Life's simpler
with a gun than a pen.
Hello everyone.
These rainy
days don't come cheap.
Where's that
dame from last night?
Back in Tampere.
It got complicated.
I thought there
was something going on.
So did I.
If two people love each other -
no barrier can keep them
apart. Just slow 'em down.
I get the feeling
you like to pry into -
other people's
private affairs.
The day you get
crushed by the big truck
on the highway of life,
you'll ask -
yourself what you didn't do -
and what
you should've left undone.
Right. Or left unsaid.
Let's move or
lunch'll be left undrunk.
How can you eat so much?
A poor childhood
gave me a big appetite.
How about life in uniform?
Any tasty soldiers?
Took one prisoner.
But I let him go.
Pity. A bit of loving
always does you good.
How's the banker
doing in prison?
Peacefully.
Lot of time to study.
Only scumbags
squeak on their mates.
Antero Kraft. A bridegroom
with dishonest intentions.
No honor. Stole a woman's heart
and Mafia money. On the hit list.
We got no room
for fucking tennis types.
In tennis, you gotta get
a firm grip on the balls.
And then you serve.
And then it's forehand, then
backhand, and so on.
Wanna play Finnish Open?
What makes a man drink?
- Women.
But you don't have one.
- That's the problem.
Even if you had one, -
you'd drink till she left then
drown your sorrows about that.
It's a vicious circle, isn't it.
You let the woman
of a lifetime escape -
then try to drink
her out of your mind.
Wrong. I just
drink to keep up my image.
But you! you can't stop.
I can go without a drink
longer than you can.
Not true.
I bet you a gallon of whisky.
Your mouth
is flapping in the wind.
Are you trying
to say something?
Here's the deal: no booze for
me till you fix your love life -
or have the next drink.
You're on.
This is going to cost you.
Here's to it.
Here's to it.
Goddamn it,
you almost got me.
I must be really
desperate to do this.
Eeva, I love you.
I love you too.
Has something happened?
- No, nothing.
Today's Helsinki
newspaper had bad news.
Lucky that the wedding's
next week. - Yeah.
I've already got
you a wedding present.
You can pick it up
from the station locker -
after the key gets to you.
Wedding present?
Look on it as a small
bridal bouquet.
You can bring it
along to the church.
One more round, please.
I think that you
two have had enough.
You saying that
we've had too much?
No, but you
better drink these first.
Then we can check
out your condition.
He thinks we're here to
drink. - Absolutely not.
Not my scene at all.
In that case,
I must ask you to leave.
They toss us out
because we don't drink.
You're upsetting
the other customers.
Jaska. I'm working.
I'll get back to you.
Mikko Koitere. A good
husband and a tough cop.
Sold his soul to the devil. In
big trouble with his conscience.
Police. Show your hands.
Out of the car.
Don't come any closer.
No closer, I said.
Hands behind your head.
On your knees.
Didn't they teach you -
that when a cop tells you to
do something, you do it?
And easy how you move.
If you still want to move at all.
Helsinki Criminal Police.
You, out. Go on, beat it.
- I could sit in the back.
You, front seat.
No extra ears required.
So, you took the
stone out of my shoe.
He won't be on
the streets for a while.
Dream of a job.
You're a helluva cop.
A high profile
jail break is coming up.
Sources that I represent have
a strong money interest in it.
I'll do my best.
Here's an advance.
The man stays free.
You make sure of it.
Understood?
Keep me informed.
The department
has a system.
Could be that I have
nothing to do with the case.
I don't think you understood.
Karl E. Miesmann. Macho
Man in capital letters.
Rock bottom aggression threshold.
Conscience? Not in his dictionary.
You keep me in the loop.
I'll call you
when I need you again.
You take care of this or
you wind up dead, you prick.
Eeva had been
through some tough times.
But this sergeant
was no quitter.
Her brother's loans
were the last straw -
and the Mafia money
her last chance.
Antero's offer of a
wedding with a difference -
was one
she could not refuse.
Eeva.
What the hell?
Let's get out of here.
What are these?
Are you going somewhere?
Not really.
Just a poor girl's fantasies.
Eeva.
Okay. But you're
not to tell anyone.
Tell anyone what?
I'm getting married.
Could Antero
be innocent, after all?
Of course not.
But that was Mafia money,
not ordinary people's.
Could I come to the church?
No, you couldn't. No way.
There's only gonna
be me, the groom, -
the priest
and two prison guards.
Don't forget that
whatever goes down -
I'm always here for you.
I won't.
I'm going to the girl's room.
Vares.
Jussi...
Eeva?
How long are
you gonna keep this up?
Till I've worked
out this woman thing.
She called you. Go get her.
- No way.
What's the problem?
Male pride?
- Shit. I don't have any.
The other guy hasn't
stopped you before.
Eeva is about
to marry this one.
Here's to it.
Here's to it.
A wedding day to remember.
- You're dressed to kill.
Thanks.
The principal characters all
seem to be here this afternoon.
Yeah. We even have
both best men along.
Everything fine?
Let's get on with it.
Suits us.
The wedding pair have
requested a short ceremony.
Here in the sight of God, -
I ask you Eeva Kristiina Sunila -
do you take Antero Kraft, -
as your lawful
wedded husband -
to love in sickness and
in health? - I do.
Antero, do you take
Eeva Kristiina Sunila, -
as your lawful wedded wife -
to love in sickness
and in health? - I do.
These rings are the
symbols of sacred wedlock.
You may kiss the bride.
Congratulations.
Who the hell is she? - Lissu.
She's my friend, don't shoot.
I don't know
what she's doing here.
You've gotta go. Sorry.
Viljanen, hi.
- Well hello watchdog.
You wouldn't know anyone -
who'd like to buy five
hundred chocolate dicks?
Can't think of anyone off-hand.
- It's good chocolate.
Have a taste. - No thanks.
Gives you energy.
Who's there today?
- A blonde.
Have a look.
Yeah.
I've always been called Pizza Boy.
Or Jarmo. Jartza will do, with a z.
Okay, Jarmo.
Jartza. Pizza Boy. Special
class for slow learners.
Hangs out with the wrong crowd.
Small brain, big heart.
Who the fuck was that woman?
Liisa. She swore
she wouldn't come.
She decided to surprise me.
- She didn't need to know.
This is the first time I've
driven a getaway wedding limo.
And I get to crash
your wedding night.
Shut the fuck up. Put the radio
on. Let's listen to the news.
Finger your pussy.
Now with your hand.
Koitere you're a big shot.
A big shot.
Put your fingers in
your cunt. There.
Now go down on me.
That's not
in the job description.
What fucking job description?
Check your job out with
Viljanen, goddamn it.
Go on, ask him.
Koitere. - It's me.
Yeah.
It's begun. - What has?
You jerk-off.
Keep me updated goddamn it.
- Understood.
Fuck.
They pulled over.
Easy. Calm down.
They're not after us.
Are they turning?
Easy, easy.
They're turning now.
They're turning.
Shit. Fuck. You and
your fucking friend.
Should I pull out?
Fucking do something!
Are they coming here?
We're gonna be ok.
They're right behind us.
- Helluva good time to belt up.
Goddamn it Jarmo.
I looked in the
mirror and saw a jerk.
I was wondering
why I had got involved.
Not a clever move.
I once did a pizza delivery.
20 miles in 8 minutes.
Let's split up. - What?
They're looking
for three people.
They can't
have the pictures yet.
I'll get some new wheels
for tonight. - Ok.
Eeva, you go straight in.
Jarmo?
No one's looking for you.
I'll go through the
market hall. Let's go.
I dunno what you think
but this ain't a sport.
Don't screw this up.
- Just making a comment.
The second you open your pie-
hole, you screw something up.
See, life's like a movie.
Just like this match here.
But when you open your mouth,
you blow the feeling away.
This is a rich guy. What the hell
is he doing with a skirt on?
When you're that filthy rich, -
I guess all you got
are the little pleasures.
How are you doing guys?
They got this guy in to fight me.
He didn't stand a chance.
So, what's up?
You had something for us.
Good news from the provinces.
The honey-moon has started.
I see.
You should
take up this stick fighting.
The adrenaline
rush gets you hooked.
I'd kick your fucking ass.
Easy, guys. Letzs sit down
You're my friends.
Now, go find the groom
and bring him home; -
Iose this gladiator; -
and get the fuck outta here.
Two months rent for
one night. Steep.
It is the bridal suite.
- Beats the shit out of prison.
Later, honey, later.
We're not finished here.
It's great to see
a celebrity like you.
Alive and all.
I don't think
we're quite that famous.
I only did this gig 'coz Hot
Lips happened to mention -
who was busting out.
Who's Hot Lips?
- None of your business.
I mean, the less
you know, the better.
This is one swell wedding
night. - Yeah, yeah.
Everything was
so easy when I drank.
Now that I'm sober,
nothing seems to work.
Antero Kraft, convicted of fraud,
escaped from prison today -
with the help
of long-term girlfriend -
and new bride Eeva Sunila.
The police request public assist-
ance in locating the refugees.
And now to the weather.
Heavy rains
are predicted country-wide
And how about this.
Name ONE bad song
written by Elton John.
Elton. Wait.
Fuck, this is a tough one.
Well, um...
The thing is, Elton John
doesn't have a single shit song.
Right on.
You're right. He doesn't.
I sensed Eeva
was way out of her depth.
I couldn't get her out of my head.
I had to move. But the only clue I
had was a hick town called Paimio.
Well the Chiseller is still the car,
isn't it? Never breaks down.
What the fuck?
Fuck. I dig you have
to drive a '74 Chrysler.
It's ok if the spare parts
have to be authentic originals.
But does the jack have to be
the same fucking vintage?
What a feeling.
You got that right.
This is straight
out of a movie.
What do you think?
What? - Which movie?
Movie? - Yeah.
Yeah. A fucking shit
movie that fucking sucks.
Look out,
there's one coming.
I got an idea.
Let's stop the car.
And if it has a better
jack, we'll take it.
What?
A better jack
A better jack? - Yeah
No fucking way. You don't
just take the fucking jack, -
you take the fucking car.
Right on.
That's what we gonna do.
What a jerk.
A real king of the road,
fuck him. - Didn't it stop?
Eeva, Eeva.
Ifigenia Multanen. A champion
in the game of erotica.
Loyal to nothing, except currency.
Colder than an ice-box.
What was on
your sweetheart's mind?
Love and longing.
Same as on mine.
Just wed, and
already calling my bitch.
The first one
to show love usually dies.
That's how the world works.
Do you love me?
If it wasn't for sex, we
men would have killed off -
you motor-mouths
a long time ago.
I think you love me, after all.
I love anyone
as bent as you are.
Antero said they'll be
at the motel. - Good.
So will the repo men.
Zushi. The world's
most expensive meal.
Makes sense.
What do you think?
Goddamn it. I'd like to get
to a table like that.
Just once in this life.
Maybe we order
one of these mags?
You've read 'em.
They're all the same.
The day someone publishes a
"What the Fuck" magazine, -
then we'll subscribe.
What the fuck? - Yeah.
A mag called "What the Fuck"?
Yep. "What the Fuck" - out now.
"What The Fuck",
with a TV-supplement.
"What The Fuck",
the fuck supplement.
See the celebrities
getting fucked.
Shock surprise, "What the Fuck".
See a playmate with clothes ON.
No more fucks. I'm getting
a hard-on. - Okay.
Did you add any salt at all?
I bet you
even eat pussy with salt.
That's different.
This is just pea-soup.
Goddamn it, Eeva.
Why doesn't Pizza Boy
go for breakfast?
So we can have some
time alone? - Honey, no.
Too much pressure.
And not in this dive.
I want it all to be perfect.
Listen. - Yeah?
I have to...
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
I'll go for food.
What do you want?
- Just a sandwich.
Why do they
call you Pizza Boy?
Me and ma gotta pizza
joint in Helsinki.
"Mama's Tasty Pizzas."
No one ever left
the place hungry.
You get along okay
with your mother?
She's a real piece of work.
She wouldn't
let me take this job -
but Mr. Passport
talked her into it.
Mr. Passport?
- He's fixing your papers.
Was it him who hired you?
- Nope. A woman did.
Hot Lips?
- That's what I call her.
I don't have a clue
what her real name is.
What's her connection
to Antero? - Dunno.
Bo Bergstr√∂m.
Koitere checking in. Hi.
- Hi.
How're you coping without
the top gun? - So-so.
My desk's flooding.
Any news
about the big escape?
We think he's in Helsinki.
We've an old tape of him -
bragging about the money to
his Ingrian flame. - Ingrian?
Is her name Ifigenia
Multanen? - Yes.
I know her well. We've
had her under surveillance.
No kidding. Hey, how
about joining the task force?
When duty calls, -
what can a police officer
do but rally to the flag?
That summer,
it rained every day.
It was easy
enough to dig graves.
And this grave-digger in rubber
gloves who was in his element.
What's on?
The Young and the Restless.
- What's it about?
I dunno.
What's the story?
- There isn't one.
I see. Any good?
- Yeah.
Guess what I'm gonna do
after the gig? - What?
I'm gonna go to a real
hot place. - Really.
To my mom's pizza
joint to bake pizza.
You're going to a beach
somewhere. - Maybe.
The jet-setters
lie under the palm trees -
and I go back
to the pizza oven.
What would I do
under a palm tree?
Maybe open up a pizza joint.
Whatever happens,
people gotta eat.
What's the story on that new
set of wheels? Where are they?
You'll find out. Just take it easy.
Easy, how?
You don't tell me anything.
Who was that on the phone?
You'll find out in time. Darling.
- And when will that be?
Now.
Who's this guy?
- He's just a driver.
Ciao. - Ciao, ciao.
Ouch. That hurt. Really hurt.
Look at that.
Small girl, big gun.
What's the score?
Ifigenia.
Nice to meet you.
Have you got
anything to say about this?
Thanks for the help, Eeva.
You've been invaluable.
I'm forever indebted.
Chill out.
It's been no picnic for me either,
watching your goings on.
Fuck you. And how
long have you been around?
I reckon that's not your biggest
concern at the moment.
Is this going
to take fucking forever?
Hardly.
Shouldn't be much longer.
Awful lot of blood.
It's a fucking mess.
You can't keep icing people
just for the hell of it.
No, you're right. We can't.
We've been told that before.
Ifigenia... - Antero, let's
leave this to the pros.
Yep. And leave the stiff
in the woods.
What a feeling. Pulp Fiction.
Yeah, that Travolta thing.
Where they killed the nigger.
They're not niggers any more.
They're Afro-Asians.
What? - Niggers.
Afro-Asian. - Afro-Asian.
I see. - Yeah.
Fucking glad that's straight.
Antero...
- This is not the right time.
It's murder.
How can you live with it?
Move on out, Antero.
I got work.
Or you can stay and watch.
I don't much care.
Ok. I...um...
Shit. What a
fucking "Antero" of a guy.
Eeva.
Unbelievable. Vares,
what are you doing here?
It was so quick.
And how could I face killers
armed with only a shovel?
Are you going
to turn me in to the cops?
Would you like me to?
- No.
Cleared that up then.
You saved me.
So I did.
Here's your bit of lego.
What did I say?
Gotta keep on looking
and never give up.
To hell with
that piece of bone.
A dentist can plant it back.
- Fuck.
It'll be good as new.
- Like hell it will.
Three million.
People kill for a few hundred.
It was a mistake to let me
live. I'll get my revenge.
We're married.
Half the money's mine.
You better think about this
seriously. - I already have.
How are you
going to get hold of it?
I've been fucked from day
one. I fucking got married.
Hot Lips. Fucking Hot Lips.
Jarmo's mom should help.
Don't get any
more outsiders involved.
I have to start somewhere.
They're professionals.
You're not.
Nor am I going to jail.
What do you want from me?
- Help me.
You know about this stuff.
Enough to know
how to stay out of it.
I'll give you
twenty-five thousand.
Sorry. I don't mind
listening to you -
but I'm not getting involved.
Yeah. And what
could one man do anyway?
But maybe you could give
me a ride to Helsinki?
Sorry.
Koitere. Reiman.
You're partners now.
Fill him in
on Helsinki street ways.
I've been lecturing police tactics
for two years at college.
Welcome.
How's things in Helsinki?
Apart from the rain?
Is it still there? Huh? Ha?
"Huh, ha."
Koitere knows this
Ifigenia piece. - I see.
Big time pimp. No evidence
though. - I see.
Ex-model. Also publicly
dated a Finnish NHL-star.
Way to go. Quite a...
what's the word?
High class hooker. - Right.
I been thinking.
If life's like a movie, we
should have a theme song.
What? - Theme music.
You mean like a song?
- Right. A short one.
First the song, and then the kill.
- Yeah. And that's it.
That's the end.
Okay. We gotta work on this.
I know a good bone trick.
Hang on.
What?
Take a hold of that. - What?
Come on. Grab it.
And then.
- And then what?
We gotta get rid of those two.
They've done what they came for.
Not till we get to the boat.
Fucking
rubber-gloved psychopaths.
Their prints are on file.
- No surprise. Given their skills.
You should hear them talking.
- You worry too much.
Maybe I just leave
the money where it is.
I want you.
Life is a series of incidents,
each one only one second long.
Everything can come to an
end in the blink of an eye.
Maybe we should try and
get some sleep somewhere.
Ok, I'll do it. - Ok.
I mean, I'll help you
get the money out of him.
You don't have to.
Sorry I pressured you.
One person
has been killed already.
If I can stay on
the wagon for two weeks, -
I can handle
the Russian mafia.
This is sick.
- Never mind.
Two years
of waiting and now this.
It's the pressure.
It's not serious.
It's that fucking
shit with the shovel.
Who knows how
that thump affected me?
If this is his doing, -
I'm going to make
sure his dick freezes.
That's why we
have Tetsuo and Red-Eye.
Any news from Paimio?
- Not that I know of. Why?
Kraft and
his bride parted company.
Not a marriage made to last.
Locate that Sunila bitch.
And keep
Antero on the loose.
Start earning your money.
Here's some motivation.
Do it or I'll drop you like -
a fucking turkey.
Thanks.
Did it happen fast?
Yes. Jarmo never felt a thing.
Who else was there besides the
Ingrian bitch and the husband?
Two guys.
One looked kind of Asian.
Tetsuo Sinkkonen.
A hockey fan.
That little shit killed my boy?
- No, the other one.
Big ape, marine haircut,
bloodshot eyes? Red-Eye Munck.
You know these guys.
- So did Jarmo.
Who's paying them?
- Miesmann. Who else?
Jarmo said you
know a passport forger.
Werneri Ahokas, Jarmozs god-
father. I'll hook you up with him.
Gennadi Antipov.
Learnt survival
skills under communism.
Top player in the
Russian black market.
Gets people killed
easily - and often.
They must
be in Helsinki by now.
If they were
heading for Helsinki.
Yes, right. Of course.
Mikko. May I call you
Mikko? - Yeah.
I heard that a porn vendor
had said you enjoy -
the fringe benefits he offers.
So what?
They're whores. Whores.
I don't force them to sell pussy.
Freedom of choice. Right?
Yeah, but the hookers should
have freedom of choice too.
Are you getting cute with me?
- No, no, no.
Who told you this?
Who? Tell me.
Who told you this?
Who? Tell me. Who?
You know these guys?
Fuck.
Werneri Ahokas
Passport dealer and forger.
Fence for stolen goods
and general facilitator.
If he was even fifty percent legal,
he would be a private investigator.
I know about you.
Who's the friend?
- Vares. Jussi Vares.
Pleased to meet you.
Jarmo was like a son to me.
I'll do what I can -
without risking my freedom.
And I'm attached to my life.
We all plan
to get out of this alive.
You don't know
Karl E. Miesmann.
Unfortunately, I do.
Get me your pictures.
Three days and Finland will
just be a beautiful memory.
Something just crossed
my mind. - What?
What day did
you visit him in prison?
It's in my diary. How come?
He mentioned
the Helsinki newspaper.
Yeah.
With some bad news in it.
There's got
to be something in that.
It used to
belong to Antero's uncle.
Maybe the dump
is worth millions.
No, it's irreparable.
They're going to start
tearing it down mid-September.
Right. It's worth looking at.
Okei
What's the name?
And the address?
Ok, we'll check it out.
Another tip off.
And where is Kraft this time?
Some old lady is convinced -
that Kraft's hiding
out in her neighbor's flat.
One of those.
But we have to check it out.
We will, we will.
But let's eat first.
I need to use the bathroom.
Karl E. Miesmann
is not available.
Please leave a message.
Me. Look's like
the hide-out is blown.
It'll kill you, you know.
What do you mean, kill me?
Do I look like I'm dying?
- No.
Well, what then? What?
Just that you
shouldn't eat that shit.
Shit. Is this shit?
What do you mean, shit?
I just meant
you should eat lighter.
You're sweating just
from taking a dump.
I'll get the money.
No fucking twins.
Think about it.
You're their bank.
I go without
them or not at all.
Ok. Just get the
fucking cash - fast.
You should take them
with you. - No.
Is everything ready?
You gotta problem?
Police. Criminal investigations.
- Ain't that something.
How about we go inside
and work out our problems.
What the fuck?
- Couple of cops.
On your knees.
Wrists to the railing.
Faces down.
What do we do with these two?
No time for anything special.
How about the theme song?
Ok. Let's get on with it.
How did he
know we were police?
The professionals always do.
A couple of days of sick
leave. Any plans?
Keep away from whores.
And go home.
Jaska. Hi.
What's up?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Were you afraid?
No. Pissed because I lost
my phone. - Take this.
No. I'll get a new
one tomorrow.
Are we here all night?
- Cut it out.
Cut what out? - That.
What's that? Don't
put on that puppy face.
What do I have to cut out?
Not right now, not in front
of Jaska. We'll talk later.
Move or talk.
And lose the dog face.
Take it easy. - I am taking it
easy. What's eating you?
And what do I have to cut out?
I've had a shitty day without your
fucking dog face and your sulks.
You know... This is useless.
Jaska, how was school today?
Don't be like your mother.
Nothing up or downstairs, damn
it. - It must be here somewhere.
Did you hurt yourself?
- Hell.
Where are you going?
A tip off about the jail breaker.
In the middle of the night?
I'll be back
in a couple of hours -
and I want to sleep
in tomorrow morning.
Alright.
What's alright? What's with
the look? - What look?
Why are you looking at
me like that? - I'm not...
How come you're up
this time anyway?
You're supposed
to be asleep.
Don't start anything now.
Get back to bed.
That's Antero.
I guess the cash isn't in
the house. - Goddamn it.
You.
Your beloved
and long-suffering wife.
Honey, I'm delighted
that you're alive.
The feeling is not mutual.
Eeva, I'm so sorry.
I couldn't do anything.
They showed up and I was...
Who the hell are you?
- Car keys and the bag. Now!
Believe me,
I didn't want you killed.
I won't enjoy
killing you either.
You get half of it.
Let's split it three ways.
Come on, guys.
Everyone wins, no one dies.
Nobody dies!
Are you promising me
eternal life, you fucking prick?
Let's have
a laugh about all this.
Two things
you don't leave behind.
Friends and witnesses.
- Eeva, I beg of you.
Would I go to jail,
to save your skin?
Hey, buddy. This is an
execution. - You slime bag.
You have no right to do this.
- Cut the crap.
No one's getting killed.
Not even you.
Toys here.
A new driver takes over.
Hold on a fucking minute.
Who's going
to drive the Chiseller?
No one. It stays here.
The Chiseller stays here?
To be kicked about by sand-
niggers and Afro-Asians?
Well we can't
fucking tow it, can we?
One dent and
the neighborhood dies.
Yeah, yeah. Count me in.
What the hell are the
condom clowns doing here?
To take your money
and gun you down.
Shut up.
We had a deal. Are we married
to these fucking maggots?
I don't trust them.
These half-wits
are going rip us off.
Darling. Give me a kiss.
I'm tempted
to wipe out all witnesses.
I think that's a great idea.
The john.
Here you are.
Money well earned.
Maybe not.
It feels wrong.
You know what's right
and what's wrong.
You're a fucking cop.
I'm saying
that we've gone too far.
You, maybe.
But you made your own bed.
And now you do as I say.
You're just a little turd.
In a big pile of shit.
You've gone too far.
- Listen.
You have a wife
and you have a son.
What the fuck you mean?
When the bullets fly, -
bystanders should
be kept out of the way.
Catch my drift?
I do.
This belongs to you.
Don't lose it.
You might still need it.
Fifty years of hockey and
one world championship.
What does that tell you?
Don't fuck with
me about ice-hockey.
You goddamned
psychopath.
Take it easy woman.
- These guys piss me off.
They come into your office
and start sounding off.
Don't forget the tooth.
- Fucking right.
Tetsu...
Is this the shovel hero?
- Absolutely.
And he's fucking with me.
That's how you
can tell a shovel hero.
They fuck with
other people's business.
Lift him up.
You could've stepped back
and left things alone.
But no.
Wanna know why?
I guess because
I'm a shovel hero.
Right. Red-Eye...
Let's boil old Antero.
Fucking Kraft.
You thought you
could fuck with me.
Bad fucking mistake.
This is what
happens to assholes.
No headlines.
No speeches.
Just a whiff of smoke in the air.
There might be
a change in the screenplay.
Is that so? - Yes.
I reckon you
want ALL the money back.
What's he saying?
Check the bag.
That's only part of it.
And you and the little bitch
know where the rest is. Right?
Something like that.
In that case,
I put a bullet in you -
and have a chat with
the badly shocked widow.
Rely on it, she'll share
what she knows with me.
Tetsu
This is the police!
Fuck it. Did you get religion?
No. More like
I got my senses back.
Fuck. You're a cop.
Lose the guns. Easy.
Let's see the hands.
Just like in the fucking movies.
Before you start blasting
away, think it over.
Hot Lips shot Kraft. The cop
shot Miesmann and Hot Lips.
And Miesmann shot the cop.
Hold on. One more time.
What was the middle bit?
Listen closely.
There are the right amount
of guns and bullets -
to wrap things up nicely.
You don't want to
leave your calling cards -
on the crime scene.
There's a fucking point in that.
What do you think?
I don't much care. Missy,
bring the bag over here.
And open it.
How about shares
to sweeten the deal?
Why not?
Like hell.
It's 50/60 and I take all.
Upsy-daisy. And vamos.
All the best.
And sorry about, er, all that.
Miesmann?
Kraft?
And this must be
Dr. Antipovzs money.
Thank you, gentlemen.
See you round.
Police officer Mikko
Koitere of the CID -
Ieft a wife and school age son.
Why don't you come with me.
Oh, right...
Your share.
Twenty-five thousand.
That's quite a pile.
Will it give
you investment hassles?
No, it's ear-marked already.
Give me an address
for a postcard.
Addresses come and go.
Send it to my local bar.
I'm going to miss you.
Good.
So long, 2nd lieutenant Vares.
I could've been on that plane.
Left this rainy country behind -
and moved to
a sunnier part of the globe.
But a Finnish
man is always a Finn.
Only one thing left to deal with, -
a debt of honor.
Can we assume -
that Vares has cleared up
matters with the opposite sex?
Matters are clear. Vares is not.
Someone sent 20 000 to the
son of that cop who was killed.
Twenty thousand.
Seems like a fair sum.
I don't understand how someone
can throw money away like that.
If I had money like that,
I'd buy... -
all sorts of things.
So you think money
buys you happiness?
I think it
buys away unhappiness.
I guess the
big money is for those -
who don't really
know what they want.
Do you know
what you really want?
Sure I do.
A couple more drinks.
This came for you today.
Another good reason to drink?
- Here's to it.
Down the hatch.
Gloves off.
We're not working now.
You can never be quite sure.
No. It's time to party.
What the fuck?
No. No.
It's a surprise theme party.
What?
In you go. Go on.
Jari, what have you done?
I'm not one of those zushi-types -
so I figured the
domestic version would do.
Fuck. We DO have style.
Jari, can I start?
Bon appetit, motherfuckers.
What the fuck?
Isabella, move out.
Get dressed.
On your knees, both of you.
You killed my son,
so now you die.
If there's anything to say,
now's the time.
Then it's greetings from Jarmo.
Tetsuo, I love you.
You always have to
fuck everything up.
Yeah. That's the end.
