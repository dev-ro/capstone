SUNG-HO'S STRAWBERRIES
Hey. Why did you only show up now?
Did you go see your mom at the hospital?
Sung-ho.
Can I borrow your phone?
No answer?
No.
Do you have any idea where you left it?
I think I left it on the train.
You can use mine for the day.
I'm not expecting calls anyway.
It's okay.
I'm sure there's a phone at home.
At home?
This house is still the best one
in the village.
Hello?
Hello. You found this phone, right?
Yes.
I'm the owner of that phone.
Did I leave it on the train?
Yes.
Where are you?
I'll come and pick it up from you.
-Maybe she'll give us some money. Ask her.
-You ask her.
Is there a reward?
Sorry?
This is a Galaxy Note 9, right?
We'll call you back.
Hello?
The number you have called is currently
unavailable. Please leave a message…
The number you have called…
FIND MY DEVICE
LOOKING FOR MY DEVICE
Hello?
You were right.
My mom's insane.
I'm totally locked up in the house.
I'm sorry,
but who were you trying to call?
Isn't this Sun-hee's number?
No, I think you have the wrong number…
Do you see this film
covering the right side of the brain?
This surgery requires us to make
an incision on the skin,
then we must split the skull
in order to remove the tumor.
We can't perform the surgery here.
It's a complicated procedure,
so she'll need to go to a bigger hospital.
A one or two millimeter difference
can lead to a coma or a paralysis.
You're cutting away all the fruit.
Do you remember Young-mi?
No.
You know,
my friend who works in insurance.
She has fair skin and a high nose bridge.
What about her?
She'll take care of it.
Take care of what?
What do you think? The insurance payout.
It's impossible to save up 100 million won
working at a convenience store.
You should…
go visit Dad's grave tomorrow.
Ask the manager there
if I should be buried beside him,
or if we should be buried together.
Mom, how can you even say that?
What?
Do you think you have the right
to be buried next to Dad?
What?
Am I wrong?
You shouldn't talk like that.
Do you still feel like painting your nails
in this situation?
FEBRUARY 24, 1965 – NOVEMBER 27, 1999
Hello?
Sun-hee! I think Mom's trying to kill me.
I'm sorry?
Come over now. You know my address, right?
4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup!
Who are you? You keep calling me.
Isn't this Sun-hee's store?
No, it's not.
Bullshit. Are you doing this on purpose?
What?

THE PLAGUED BATHROOM SHALL BE BURNT DOWN
IN SECRET AND MOTHER SETS ME ON FIRE
Do you know her?
Young-sook…
Young-sook?
Was she a shaman?
No, not Young-sook. But her mother was.
Did our house used to belong to a shaman?
No, I wouldn't say that.
You just said her mother was a shaman.
Well, that was ages ago.
It was back in the '90s,
so I hardly remember anything.
-But you knew her name--
-Strawberry, what's this?
I told you not to do this.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Come here. Come.
Come here.
Come on! Come here.
NOVEMBER 26, 1999
SUN-HEE'S STORE
Sun-hee, please come help me! Hurry!
What?
Mom's trying to set me on fire now!
My mom is trying to…
Hello?
Hello?
Give it here.
Hello?
Why didn't you come yesterday?
How can you do this to me?
Is your address really
4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup?
Isn't this Sun-hee?
I saw your picture, Ms. Oh Young-sook.
The one that was taken
on November 26, 1999.
What?
But it's the 18th today.
Did you write this
in your diary yesterday?
"New life was born,
and the parents began to oppress again"?
NEW LIFE WAS BORN,
AND THE PARENTS BEGAN TO OPPRESS AGAIN
Are you watching me right now?
This is going to be hard to believe,
but I think…
we're in the same house right now.
I'm sorry.
I must've called the wrong number.
Wait.

Do you want to go back

Do you want to end up like your mom?
Oh Young-sook.
Oh Young-sook.
This is happening
because of bad feng shui.
-You'll feel better as soon as we move.
-Breaking news.
There's been a domestic airline accident.
This afternoon,
flight 1633 slipped off the runway
while trying to land at Gimpo Airport.
PLANE CRASH AT GIMPO AIRPORT
Hello?
How did you know?
How old are you, Young-sook?
I'm 28.
I'm also 28.
I was…
I was born in 1972.
Oh.
You like Seo Taiji, don't you?
This is Seo Taiji's song?
He'll return from the States
and make a comeback in 2000.
It sounds like him, but…
So there's a computer inside the phone?
Yes.
It's called a smartphone.
You can do almost anything with it.
What about music?
Do you have Walkmans?
"Walkmans"?
Yes.
Don't you know what they are?
They play music.
Oh, music?
Of course you can.
You can take pictures, watch movies,
and even shop on your phone.
Sounds like you're lying to me.
I can understand. When I was young,
I never imagined
we'd be able to make video calls.
Video calls?
Yes, you can see the other person
while talking on the phone.
That's possible?
Are you curious about anything else?
I wonder what I'll be like.
Oh, good question.
You want me to find out?
OH YOUNG
No.
Why not?
Finding you would be a piece of cake.
My mom told me
that I'm cursed with a wretched fortune.
She said I was born
with a brutal, atrocious fate.
Anyway, she's crazy.
She locks me up at home
and doesn't let me see anyone.
Do you not get along with your mother?
With my mom?
That woman is not my real mom.
My real mom is dead.
I'm sorry.
Why are you sorry?
It's not like you killed her.
Actually, I also lost my dad
when I was young.
Really?
How?
There was a fire at our place.
My mom forgot to turn off the gas valve.
Hey, Young-sook.
Yes?
What did you say the date was over there?
Seo-yeon, I think my mom's coming.
I'll call you back in a bit.
Hey, wait.
NOVEMBER 21, 1999
We're here!
Wow! Chickens!
Hey, be careful. Don't run.
What a nice house! Isn't the air so clean?
A missionary used to live here.
It's a luxurious mansion,
which is hard to come by in this area.
I see.
You shouldn't touch that.
It's a nice location with good feng shui.
You know what our elders always say.
You've got to live on a good lot
to improve your health and wealth.
You said it's about 100 pyeong
both floors combined, right?
That's right.
It's pretty big.
Oh, they have fish.
Hey, don't run.
Look, it's spacious enough
for your kid to run around.
Could we see upstairs too?
Seo-yeon.
Seo-yeon?
Stop poking around in someone else's home.
What's that room for?
That's my daughter's room.
Just a moment.
Open the door.
Hello.
Dad.
That girl is scary.
Seo-yeon.
I'm so sorry.
She's too young to know better.
Is your name Seo-yeon?
Hello?
Hey! Wake up. Now!
What is it?
Hold on.
I guess you're planning
to run a farm or something?
Yes. We want to live
in a quiet and peaceful place now.
And it'd be nice for my daughter
to grow up close to nature.
Oh, yeah? This is the best place for that.
I'm thinking of starting a flower farm.
Well, it won't be easy
for city folks like you.
I'm originally from Bosung.
Oh? Are you?
Yes, I sure am.
Dad, come on. Chickens.
All right, let's go.
-Did you see them in the yard?
-Yes.
When did you see them?
Did you hear them?
What do you think?
Hello?
You're shocked, aren't you?
Hey…
Young-sook, I…
What?
Can you…
You know what? I have a fun idea.
Maybe I can
bring your dad back to life.

Did you get scolded by your mom?
This is cool.

Okay, sure.
All right, I'm sorry.
No worries.
Oh, no! Gosh!
Be careful, Seo-yeon.

Young-sook, listen to me carefully.
I think…
you're going to die tonight.
What are you talking about?
You already…
died in this house.
You really killed me.
Why did you do that?
Why did you want to kill me?

I don't care.
I have nothing to lose.
Answer me.
Why did you do that?
Why did you kill me?
Why?
Answer me! Now!
Are you still reciting that bullshit?
Hello?
Is that you, Young-sook?
Yes, it's me.
Are you okay? Nothing happened, right?

-Hello, Sung-ho.
-Hey, Seo-yeon. You're home.
My gosh, what's that?
-Hey, you.
-I just picked these.
You spoil us every year.
It's strawberry season.

They look so delicious.
These look especially good.
-Wash these.
-These are for you.
-Strawberries spoil fast.
-I'll do it.
No, it's fine.
-The fridge, please.
-Sure. Let's do that.
Is it a special day?
Do I look pretty?
I brought some strawberries.
Strawberries?
Come here.
Is your mom out?
Hey.

I thought she was a good-natured girl.
She'd listen to me
complain about my alcoholic dad,

If it wasn't for her mom…
I'd be dead now.
It's me.
I have something to ask you.
Was it you?

Your mom and Sung-ho.
Did you kill them?
