Announcer: PLEASE GIVE
A WARM WELCOME TO LEE SCOTT
WAL-MART STORES INCORPORATED.
WELL...
I KNOW.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I KNOW.
EVERY...
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT.
EVERY YEAR...
OKAY OKAY.
IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE
FOR ANYBODY
TO BE THE CEO OF THIS COMPANY
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE SAM WALTON
OR YOU'RE DAVID GLASS
OR YOU'RE LEE SCOTT.
WHEN YOU COME TO THIS MEETING
YEAR AFTER YEAR
YOU GET TO SAY
"WE HAD RECORD SALES."
"WE HAD RECORD EARNINGS."
"WE HAD RECORD REINVESTMENT
BACK INTO OUR COMPANY."
I SAY ALL THAT
BUT LET ME TELL YOU MY FRIENDS
YOU BETTER BE READY
TO BE BETTER.
BECAUSE TODAY
FOR WHATEVER REASON
WHETHER IT'S OUR SUCCESS
OR OUR SIZE
WAL-MART STORES INCORPORATED
HAS GENERATED FEAR IF NOT ENVY
IN SOME CIRCLES.
AND THAT MAKES IT
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER
THAT WE FOCUS
ON DOING THE RIGHT THING
AND DOING THINGS RIGHT
EVERY TIME.
THERE'S TWO THINGS
THAT WE SHOULD DO.
NUMBER ONE IS TELL
THE WAL-MART STORY.
GET THE MESSAGE OUT THERE.
AND THE SECOND THING
IS STAY THE COURSE.
WAL-MART IS TOO IMPORTANT
TO INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES
WHO ARE STRETCHING A BUDGET.
WE'RE TOO IMPORTANT
TO THE SUPPLIERS
WHO EMPLOY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
WE'RE TOO IMPORTANT
TO OUR ASSOCIATES
FOR WHO WE HAVE SO MUCH LOVE
AND VALUE SO MUCH.
AND YOUR COMPANY
WILL CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE
OUR CITIZENSHIP
AS A GOOD EMPLOYER
AND A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITIES
THAT WE SERVE SO WELL
AROUND THIS WORLD.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
I'LL PROMISE YOU THIS --
WE'RE GONNA STAY THE COURSE.
AND THIS COMPANY
IS GONNA CONTINUE TO GROW.
Don:
ACTUALLY H&H WAS STARTED...
1962.
STARTED ON MAIN STREET
IN MIDDLEFIELD.
LITTLE COUNTRY STORE THAT
AT THAT TIME
I WAS STARTING A FAMILY AND IT
WAS PRETTY DIFFICULT TO KNOW.
IT WAS A BIG DECISION.
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW AND I DECIDED
WE WERE GOING TO TAKE THAT STEP.
WE WENT INTO BUSINESS.
STARTED IN A LITTLE
ONE-ROOM BUILDING
THAT HAD A FULL BASEMENT.
WE DID ALL OF THE PLUMBING
IN THE BASEMENT.
THE UPSTAIRS RETAIL AREA
WAS VERY SMALL.
WE WERE THERE FOR
A YEAR AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS.
THEN WE MOVED ON TO A LARGER
STORE IN A SHOPPING CENTER
AND SPENT SEVERAL YEARS THERE.
THEN PROCEEDED IN 1992
AND BUILT THIS FACILITY HERE.
THIS GENTLEMAN HERE
HAPPENS TO BE MY SON.
HE'S BEEN A RIGHT-HAND MAN
FOR MANY MANY YEARS.
IT WAS MUCH EASIER
TO RETIRE IN '96
WHEN HE WAS HERE TO TAKE OVER.
Jon: ONE OF THE BIGGEST PARTS
BEING IN THE RURAL AREAS
WHAT WE CALL
OUR HARDWARE SECTION --
THE NUTS AND THE BOLTS AND THE
NAILS AND ALL TYPE OF FASTENERS.
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN GOOD
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE FARMERS
WERE ALWAYS MENDING MACHINERY
AND THINGS AROUND THE FARM.
SOME OF THE KIDS THAT WERE KID
S WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN HERE
NOW THEY'VE GOT FAMILIES
AND THEY COME IN HERE
FOR THE FIX-IT-UP-TYPE THINGS.
PROBABLY SINCE I WAS 8
COME DOWN ON FRIDAY NIGHTS
AFTER SCHOOL WORK TILL 9:00.
DO YOU HAVE THE CAR?
I WORKED HERE SINCE I WAS 6.
SWEPT OR HELPED CUSTOMERS
WHEN I WAS YOUNG TOO.
AT THE END OF THE DAY
GRANDPA OR DAD WOULD GIVE US
THEIR POCKET CHANGE.
I SPENT A LOT OF LATE NIGHTS
IN HERE TOO
ESPECIALLY
WHEN WE WERE BUILDING IT.
I GENERALLY ARRIVE HERE
ABOUT 7:15 IN THE MORNING
AND I UNLOCK THE DOOR.
I COME IN AND TURN
THE LIGHTS ON
AND I GET THE DAY MONEY FOR
EACH DRAWER IN THE REGISTERS.
I OPEN UP THE REGISTERS
AND USUALLY AT THAT TIME
TOM IS HERE.
TOM GOES AHEAD AND KIND OF
TIDIES UP THE FRONT OF THE STORE
AND SETS OUT THE AMERICAN FLAG
AND THE BENCHES
FOR OUR CUSTOMERS TO SIT ON.
THE AMISH FELLAS
ON THEIR WAY TO WORK
WILL STOP HERE FOR THINGS THEY
NEED FOR THEIR DAY'S PROJECTS.
THEY'LL COME AND GET PLUMBING
OR ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES
OR A LOT OF TIMES
SPORTING GOODS.
WE HAVE A BUSY
SPORTING-GOODS DIVISION.
Don: JON HAS BEEN PREPARING
FOR IT
TRYING TO CHANGE
STOCK AND INVENTORY.
KEEPING IN MIND BASICALLY
TO STAY WITH SERVICE.
IF YOU CAN'T COMPETE
IN ONE AREA
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OFFERED
OR THAT YOU CAN COMPETE IN.
Man: I'VE PROBABLY BEEN SHOPPING
HERE FOR 32 YEARS OR SO.
ALL MY NEEDS
THAT I NEED FOR HARDWARE...
Jon: THE MASS MERCHANDISERS
TO A GREAT EXTENT
DO NOT PROVIDE
EXCELLENCE IN SERVICE.
I'LL USE WAL-MART AS AN EXAMPLE.
YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY IF THEY HAVE
ANYONE IN THE PLUMBING SECTION
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING
ABOUT PLUMBING.
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET READY
FOR THEM FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS.
I HAD A MEETING WITH THE GUYS.
EXPLAINED THE PURPOSE OF OUR JOB
AND MAKE SURE
WE DO EVERYTHING RIGHT.
EXPLAINED WHAT WAL-MART DID
AND WHAT WE DO
AND WHAT WE CAN DO DIFFERENT.
THIS WAS BROUGHT TO US
BY AN AMISH CUSTOMER OF MINE.
HE'S SO MUCH AGAINST
THE WAL-MART MOVEMENT
AFTER READING THIS BOOK
THAT HE WANTED TO GET SOME IN
AND START PASSING THEM OUT
OR SELLING THEM TO FRIENDS
WHATEVER IT COST HIM.
THAT'S BASICALLY...
I GOT A FEW EXTRA ONES.
HE'S TAKING SEVERAL OF THEM
AND IS GETTING RID OF THEM.
WILL I? I HAVE NEVER BEEN
IN A WAL-MART STORE.
I NEVER INTEND
TO GO IN A WAL-MART STORE.
I'VE NEVER HAD THE NEED
AND I'VE NEVER LIKED
THEIR PRINCIPLES.
THAT'S NOT NICE TO SAY AT ALL
PROBABLY
BUT I'VE SEEN
A LOT OF SMALL COMMUNITIES
CRUCIFIED AND FORCED OUT.
MA AND PA OPERATIONS THAT HAVE
BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR YEARS
THAT ARE OUT ON THE STREET.
THEY HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS
JUST BECAUSE OF ONE ENTITY.
AND IT APPEARS THAT
THAT IS THEIR INTENT --
TO COME INTO A COMMUNITY
AND FORCE EVERYBODY OUT.
THEY DID NOTHING BUT LAY DOWN
THE RED CARPET FOR THEM.
I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
FOR MY DAD MY GRANDFATHER
TO BUILD THIS BUILDING
ON THIS LOT.
THEY WENT THROUGH EVERYTHING
TO TRY TO GET
THE COMMISSIONERS AND STUFF
TO ALLOW THEM TO BUILD.
WE HAD SIGN ISSUES.
GOTTA BE A CERTAIN SIZE.
WE HAD TO MAKE SURE WE HAD
ENOUGH GREEN AROUND THE AREA.
Jon:
I'M ALL FOR FREE ENTERPRISE
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THE BIG PICTURE
THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE COMPANY
ARE THE RICHEST PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD.
SO IN REALITY I THINK
THEY COULD SPREAD THAT OUT.
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MUCH
THEY'LL ACTUALLY GIVE BACK
TO THE COMMUNITY.
TO EVEN USE AMERICAN WITH
WAL-MART IN THE SAME SENTENCE
I DON'T AGREE WITH AT ALL.
IT'S...
IT'S LIKE A CHINESE COMPANY
TO ME
ONLY WITH AMERICAN
BOARD MEMBERS.
IT'S NOT A MYSTERY.
THEY COME RIGHT OUT ON RECORD
AND SAID
THEY DON'T BUY AMERICAN.
Dr. Bruening:
ALL IT'S DONE IS GIVE CHINA
A BETTER DISTRIBUTION CENTER
.
WHEREAS BEFORE THEY WOULD
HAVE HAD TO FIND CONTACTS
AND DEVELOP THEIR OWN MARKETS.
NOW THEY'VE GOT A PIPELINE RIGHT
INTO EVERYBODY'S LIVING ROOM.
Glassburner:
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT
SHOULD HAVE MORE CONTROL.
YOU TALK ABOUT MONOPOLIES.
IF WAL-MART'S NOT A MONOPOLY
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.
I'M NOT AT ALL IN FAVOR OF ANY
KIND OF COMMUNISM OR SOCIALISM.
I BELIEVE AMERICA SHOULD ALWAYS
AND FOREVER REMAIN FREE.
HOWEVER I THINK THERE NEED
TO BE REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED
WHEREIN...
YOU KNOW
THEY BUSTED UP STANDARD OIL.
AND THEY BUSTED UP MA BELL
BUT WAL-MART SEEMS TO BE
GOING ON A RAMPAGE
THROUGH THE AMERICAN ECONOMY
AND NOBODY'S EVEN
PAYING ATTENTION.
I DON'T...
THE LOGIC OF IT ESCAPES ME.
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME
THINKING ABOUT IT.
I'M A REPUBLICAN.
I'M A CONSERVATIVE.
I'M FOLLOWING VERY CLOSELY
WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE UNIONS.
IT USED TO BE THE UNION WAGE
WAS SOMETHING EVERYBODY
WOULD LOOK UP AT
AND SAY
"WOW HE'S A UNION WORKER.
HE'S MAKING $18 OR $20
AN HOUR."
I REALIZED THAT'S
WHAT WE'RE PAYING OUR PEOPLE.
WE'RE NOT UNION.
I'M ALL FOR THE UNIONS
DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN DO
WHETHER IT BE WAL-MART OR KMART
OR ANY STORE THAT'S NOT
GONNA PAY A FAIR WAGE.
I LOVE AMERICA.
IT'S THE FINEST COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD.
I'D STILL AT MY AGE
FIGHT AND DIE FOR THIS COUNTRY.
BUT IT SEEMS THERE ARE THINGS
GOING ON WITHIN THIS COUNTRY
PARTICULARLY FROM A BUSINESS
AND ECONOMIC STANDPOINT
THAT AREN'T FOR THE GOOD
OF THE PEOPLE.
I MEAN THE PEOPLE EN MASSE.
A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION IS
DOING WELL BY WHAT'S HAPPENING
BUT THE GREATER MAJORITY
OF THE PEOPLE
ARE BEING MADE SUBSERVIENT.
SAM WALTON I DON'T THINK
WOULD BE COMFORTABLE
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING.
I DON'T THINK THIS WAS WHY
HE STARTED THE STORE.
IT WASN'T TO CRUSH
OTHER COMPETITION.
Faenza:
WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
FAMILIES WHO CAN'T FEED
THEIR CHILDREN.
AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE
THE ENTIRETY OF THEIR BELONGINGS
IN A CAR AND IN A TRAILER
AND ARE SPENDING MOST OF THEIR
LIFE IN THEIR CAR OR AT THE MALL
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN EVICTED
FROM THEIR HOMES
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK.
THEY CAN'T FIND WORK.
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT DON'T REALIZE
THERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE
IN TOWN TOO.
YOU SAY
THAT'S IN MIDDLEFIELD.
"OH NO."
EXACTLY.
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
I WAS DREAMING
THAT THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
CAUGHT ON TO A GREAT EXTENT
AND WE WERE ALL OUT
IN THE STREET PROTESTING.
BUT I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD
OF THAT HAPPENING IS...
WE'LL PROBABLY SEE PIGS FLY
BEFORE THAT.
Jon: I PUT THIS
BUSINESS PLAN TOGETHER
WITH THE HELP OF DIFFERENT
ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE.
I WENT TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT
BANKS TO CHECK ON SOME FUNDING.
WHEN I GOT AN APPRAISAL ON
THE BUSINESS AND THE BUILDINGS
THE APPRAISER ACTUALLY CAME IN
AND DEVALUED THE BUILDING.
AND HERE I FIGURED IT WOULD BE
APPRECIATING AFTER 10 YEARS.
AND HE CAME IN
WITH A LOWER VALUE.
AND I QUESTIONED HIM.
"HOW CAN THIS BE?
"WITH INFLATION
AND THE ECONOMY'S NOT GREAT
BUT IT STILL SHOULD BE
HOLDING ITS VALUE."
AND HE SAID "NO."
"ANYTIME A WAL-MART'S
COMING INTO A TOWN"
"THEY KNOCK THE VALUES DOWN"
"BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER"
"THERE'S GONNA BE
A BUNCH OF EMPTY BUILDINGS"
"AND NONE OF THEM
ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO SELL."
ANY COMMUNITY ON A GRAND OPENING
IS GOING TO SEE A CHANGE --
DROP IN SALES.
IT HAPPENS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
IT'S WAL-MART OR SOMEBODY ELSE.
YOU'LL GET A DROP IN SALES.
SO THERE WILL BE
A DRAMATIC CHANGE OF SOME TYPE.
HOW LONG IT'LL LAST --
IT CAN'T LAST FOREVER BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T STAND THE OVERHEAD
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BUSINESS.
SO SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN.
AND LET'S HOPE IT DOESN'T
COME TO THAT POINT
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.
Jon: WELL RIGHT NOW
AFTER WE LIQUIDATE PRODUCT...
I'M IN THE PROCESS
OF TRYING TO SELL THE...
WE OWN THE BUILDING SO
I'M TRYING TO SELL THE BUILDING
AS WELL AS GET SOMEBODY IN HERE
THAT'LL BE ABLE TO LEASE TOO.
I'VE GOT A COUPLE PEOPLE
ON THE LINE
THAT WANT TO TALK TO ME
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.
HOPEFULLY
WE'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT
WHERE WE CAN SELL THE PROPERTY
AND I'LL BE ABLE
TO PAY ALL MY BILLS
AND WALK AWAY WITHOUT ANY DEBT.
THAT'S IF IT ALL
WORKS OUT RIGHT.
I PRAY THAT IT WILL.
Nicholson: I REMEMBER THAT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.
THE HELL WITH IT.
WAL-MART WILL BUY THE DAMN TOWN.
WE'LL SHUT THEM DOWN.
WE USED TO DRIVE THROUGH TOWNS
GOING "6 MONTHS.
3 MONTHS. 6 MONTHS"
OF WHEN WE'D BE CLOSING THEM
.
Man: YOU DRIVE ALL THE WAY UP
TO NEW YORK CITY ON ROUTE 80.
YOU CAN PULL OFF AT CLARION
OR ANY OF THOSE TOWNS UP THERE
AND YOU'LL SEE A WAL-MART
UP ON THE HILL.
YOU'LL SEE A PERKINS
AND MAYBE A BURGER KING.
THEN YOU'LL DRIVE
FARTHER INTO THE TOWN
AND YOU'LL SEE AN EMPTY TOWN.
IT LOOKS LIKE A NEUTRON BOMB
HIT IT.
Springsteen: WELL I RODE
THAT RIBBON OF HIGHWAY
I SAW ABOVE ME
THE ENDLESS SKYWAY
Norman: THEY DON'T GET IT.
WHEN WE START TALKING
ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE
THEY START TALKING
ABOUT CHEAP UNDERWEAR.
I KEEP SAYING
"YOU CAN'T BUY SMALL-TOWN
QUALITY OF LIFE AT A WAL-MART."
THEY DON'T SELL IT.
BUT ONCE THEY STEAL IT
YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK
AT ANY PRICE.
I FOLLOWED MY FOOTSTEPS
THROUGH THE SPARKLING SANDS
OF HER DIAMOND DESERTS
AND ALL AROUND ME...
Thibodeaux: WE THOUGHT IT WAS
THE MOST FANTASTIC THING
IN THE WORLD
THAT WAL-MART WAS COMING
TO HEARNE TEXAS.
IT WAS LIKE THEY HAD BESTOWED
SOME GREAT HONOR
ON THE COMMUNITY.
AND WE WELCOMED THEM
LITERALLY WITH OPEN ARMS.
WE COULD NOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD
ABOUT THEM.
COULD NOT DO ENOUGH FOR THEM
TO HELP THEM COME.
WHEN WAL-MART FIRST MADE
THE DECISION TO COME HERE
YOU COULD COME TO TOWN
ON A SATURDAY EVENING
AND NOT FIND A PARKING PLACE
ANYWHERE.
I CAME TO DOWNTOWN HEARNE
ON SATURDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
AND THERE WAS 12 CARS
IN DOWNTOWN HEARNE.
I COUNTED THEM.
12 CARS IN DOWNTOWN HEARNE.
THAT IS PATHETIC.
THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND
THIS LAND IS MY LAND
FROM CALIFORNIA
TO THE NEW YORK ISLAND
FROM THE REDWOOD FOREST
TO THE GULF STREAM WATERS
OH THIS LAND WAS MADE
FOR YOU AND ME
WAL-MART WAS A GREAT THING
FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
IT'S REALLY AWAKENED
THE WEST SIDE OF OUR TOWN.
I THINK SAM WALTON
WOULD TELL US
JUST AS HE DID
BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY
THAT THE NUMBER-ONE THING IN
THIS COMPANY IS OUR ASSOCIATES.
WE'VE GOT STORES
THAT AREN'T TREATING ASSOCIATES
AS WELL
AS THEY SHOULD BE TREATED.
IT'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGE.
I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH
FOR ANYTHING ELSE.
I WAS DOING REALLY WELL.
I HAD A 4.0 AVERAGE.
BUT LIFE HAPPENS.
MY DAD GOT SICK.
MY MOM GOT SICK.
AND THINGS HAPPEN
AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT
THE WAY I THOUGHT
IT WAS GOING TO.
WHEN I STARTED WORKING THERE
I HAD SO MUCH PRIDE IN MY JOB.
I DID.
I DIDN'T MIND BEING THERE
WHEN THEY NEEDED ME.
I DIDN'T MIND DOING...
I KNEW
THAT WE WERE SHORT-STAFFED.
AT THAT TIME I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS A PURPOSEFUL THING.
THAT'S THEIR INTENTION.
THEY HAD STACKS LIKE THIS
OF APPLICATIONS IN THE BACK.
THEY JUST DIDN'T HIRE THEM.
WE'RE TOLD
"WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WE DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE."
AND I REALLY DID AT FIRST
I WAS REALLY...
I FELT BAD FOR THEM.
IT WAS LIKE "OH OKAY."
"I'LL GIVE YOU
AN EXTRA HOUR HERE.
I'LL COME IN EARLY TOMORROW.
I WON'T TAKE MY DAY OFF."
DeVoy:
ALWAYS HAVING TO STAY LATE.
SUPPOSED TO WORK TILL 11:00.
YOU'RE THERE TILL 12:00 12:30.
KEEP THE NUMBER OF ASSOCIATES
FROM BEING FULL TIME
AS MANY AS YOU CAN.
KEEP THEM PART TIME
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.
AND JUST KEEP REDUCING
THAT EXPENSE.
THE COMPANY
DOESN'T ALLOW THE STORES
ENOUGH PAYROLL DOLLARS
TO GET THE JOB DONE.
AND THE JOB IS ENORMOUS.
THIS COMPANY IS RAKING
IN THE DOUGH IN THE SALES.
MY STORE ALONE DID
OVER $100 MILLION IN SALES
THE YEAR THAT I LEFT.
DeVoy: HAVING TO GET UP
WITH THE KIDS.
JUST GETTING THEM OUT TO SCHOOL
AFTER FOUR HOURS' SLEEP.
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT WHAT YOU SACRIFICE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY
PEOPLE LOSE THEIR FAMILIES.
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF THE ASSOCIATES
HAVE GOOD HEALTH CARE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYTHING
OTHER THAN WHAT
THE BOTTOM-LINE PROFIT IS
FOR THAT STORE THAT MONTH.
IT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT
TO HAVE A GOOD FAMILY LIFE
AT WAL-MART.
IF YOU CAN SQUEEZE EVERY DIME
OUT OF THEM YOU GO FOR IT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
TO THEIR FAMILIES.
IF THEY FALL APART THEY GET
SICK THE HELL WITH THEM.
WE'RE TROUBLED BY THE FACT
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO WORK FULL TIME
WHO IN FACT
CANNOT PROVIDE ENOUGH
FOR THEIR FAMILIES
TO LIVE DECENTLY.
IT WAS JUST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO PAY MY BILLS
AND PAY FOR DAY CARE AND WORK.
YOU SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO GO INTO THE OFFICE.
THE MONEY I DID GET
WENT RIGHT BACK INTO WAL-MART.
I'D GET MY CHECK.
HAVE IT DEPOSITED.
GO SHOPPING.
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WAL-MART
I HAD MY KIDS
ON THE WAL-MART INSURANCE.
IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE IT
WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE.
I JUST COULDN'T AFFORD IT.
I'D HAVE TO PAY MY PREMIUMS
AT WORK.
AND WHEN I TOOK THEM TO THE
DOCTOR'S I STILL HAD TO PAY.
I ALWAYS HAD TO PAY
A CHUNK OF MONEY.
I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE
HAVE THE BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE
AND THAT WE HAVE THE WAGES
WE HAVE.
PEOPLE THAT'S MAKING $7 AN HOUR
THAT HAS TO GO TO A DOCTOR
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO MEET THEIR DEDUCTIBLE.
Woman:
I HAVE AN 18-MONTH-OLD BABY
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY KIND OF INSURANCE.
WHEN HE WAS SICK I WOULD HAVE
TO TRY AND FIX HIM MYSELF.
GET HIM MEDICATION MYSELF.
IF HE HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR
I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE HIM
AND PAY IT AS I COULD.
SAM WALTON BELIEVED
THAT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE
FOR AN ASSOCIATE
WITH ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY
TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
HOW WERE THEY GOING TO SURVIVE
THE FINANCIAL IMPACT?
Noble: I WAS UNDER
MY MOM'S INSURANCE PLAN
WITH A LOCAL GROCERY STORE
THAT SHE WORKED FOR.
ANY PRESCRIPTION IT WAS
IT WAS $5.
AND NOW THROUGH WAL-MART
FOR THAT ONE BOTTLE OF PILLS
I'M PAYING $70.
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO PUT MY CHILDREN
ON THE WAL-MART INSURANCE
BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN AFFORD
TO HAVE $75 TAKEN OUT
OF EACH CHECK JUST FOR MEDICAL.
THAT'S WHY
BECAUSE I'M SUCH LOW-INCOME
I AM ABLE TO GET
THE MEDICAID FOR THE KIDS
THROUGH COLORADO STATE.
BUT THEY'RE A BILLION-DOLLAR
CORPORATION
SO I DON'T SEE
WHY THEY CANNOT OFFER
A BETTER MEDICAL PACKAGE
FOR THEIR ASSOCIATES
SO THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO GET
OUR FAMILIES ON INSURANCE.
YOU START WEIGHING
"OKAY HE'S SICK.
WE EAT.
WHICH ONE DO WE DO?"
"WELL LET'S GIVE HIM
AN ASPIRIN."
NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS
THEY'RE AT POVERTY LEVEL.
I WATCHED SO MANY PEOPLE
GO WITHOUT LUNCH IN THE LOUNGES
THAT I STOPPED EATING
IN THE LOUNGES.
I HAD MY MANAGERS EAT IN THERE
BECAUSE I COULDN'T STAND IT.
THEY JUST WOULDN'T EAT
AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED
TO OFFER THEM ANY MONEY.
AND THERE WERE PEOPLE I'D SEE
THAT DIDN'T EAT NOTHING.
THEY'D TAKE AN HOUR LUNCH
AND JUST SIT THERE.
WE HAD FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES
THAT WORKED AT WAL-MART.
AND THEY HAD MEDICAL.
BUT THE MEDICAL WAS SO HIGH
SO THEY HAD TO GO OUT AND GET
SOME TYPE OF GOVERNMENT MEDICAL.
WHILE I WAS WORKING AT WAL-MART
I WAS ON WIC.
IT'S AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM.
IT SAVED MY LIFE REALLY
BECAUSE YOU GOT ALL THE FORMULA
AND CEREAL AND STUFF
YOU NEEDED FOR THE BABY.
AND I ALSO WENT
TO THE MEDICAID OFFICE.
IT CAN BE A REAL HASSLE
HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE OFFICES
BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE THERE.
I'M THANKFUL FOR THE PROGRAMS
THAT ARE AVAILABLE.
IT'S NOT A FUN SITUATION.
IT'S DEMEANING.
I ALWAYS HEARD PEOPLE SAY
"THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE
WHO JUST USE THE SYSTEM."
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT
BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY
I WOULD WANT TO SPEND
ANY LENGTH OF TIME
HAVING TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
TO GET ASSISTANCE.
YOU TALK ABOUT
USING THE SYSTEM.
LOOK AT THE WAY WAL-MART
IS USING THE SYSTEM.
THEY'RE PROMOTING PEOPLE
TO GO TO HEALTHY KIDS
AND TO GET FOOD STAMPS
AND SECTION 8 HOUSING.
THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT ARE USING THE SYSTEM.
YEAH IT'S PRETTY BAD WHEN
YOU NEED TO TELL YOUR EMPLOYEES
THAT "ALL THESE PROGRAMS
ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOU
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PAYING YOU
ENOUGH MONEY."
RETAIL GIANT WAL-MART
IS ENCOURAGING ITS WORKERS
TO GO ON WELFARE.
INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR EMPLOYEES
TO HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS
SHE SAYS WAL-MART IS MAKING
THE GOVERNMENT TAKE CARE OF IT.
IN FLORIDA WAL-MART HAS MORE
EMPLOYEES AND FAMILY MEMBERS
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID
THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY.
CRITICS ACCUSE THE RETAIL GIANT
OF USING MEDICAID
AND STATE PROGRAMS FOR THE POOR
AS ITS HEALTH-CARE PLAN.
Man: THIS REPORT
FROM U.C. BERKELEY RESEARCHERS
CONCLUDES WAL-MART COSTS STATE
TAXPAYERS $86 MILLION A YEAR
AND COUNTY TAXPAYERS
AS MUCH AS ANOTHER $25 MILLION
TO PICK UP THE TAB FOR PUBLIC
HEALTH CARE INCOME-TAX CREDITS
HOUSING SUBSIDIES
AND FOOD STAMPS.
Woman: EVELYN DEES USED TO WORK
FULL TIME FOR WAL-MART
BUT DIDN'T HAVE COMPANY
HEALTH-CARE BENEFITS.
SHE LITERALLY
COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT
SO SHE TURNED
TO GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE.
Woman #2: WHAT THE PUBLIC
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
IS THAT THOSE
"EVERYDAY LOW PRICES"
ARE BASED ON TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES.
WAL-MART IS GETTING AWAY WITH IT
BECAUSE THEY CAN.
I TALKED TO THE REGIONAL
PERSONNEL MANAGER
ABOUT WHO WAS GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF THE WAL-MART ASSOCIATES
AND THEIR HEALTH-CARE NEEDS.
HE SAID "LET THE STATE DO IT."
THE PERSONNEL MANAGER
TOLD ME PERSONALLY
THAT THERE'S ASSISTANCE
OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE.
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE
TO GO USE IT.
USE YOUR TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS.
I HAD A LIST OF ALL
OF THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
AND THE DIFFERENT PLACES
PEOPLE COULD GO
IF THEY NEEDED MONEY
FOR THEIR UTILITY BILLS
IF THEY NEEDED TO APPLY
FOR FOOD STAMPS
OR IF THEY NEEDED TO APPLY
FOR WIC OR FOR MEDICAID.
YOUR DIGNITY IS NOT THERE.
YOUR PRIDE IS NOT THERE.
YOU GO TO WORK KNOWING THAT
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH MONEY
TO REALLY MAKE ENDS MEET
BUT YET YOU GOTTA GO WITH
A SMILE ON YOUR FACE AND FAKE IT.
YEAH THAT'S PRETTY BAD.
COME UP WITH SOME TYPE
OF HEALTH CARE
THAT A FULL-TIME PERSON
CAN AFFORD.
AND DON'T HAVE TO PUT
ON THE SCALE
"HEALTH CARE"
OR "FEED MY FAMILY."
"WHY IS IT THAT A CORPORATION
THAT IN 2003
"HAD AN OUTSTANDING
$240 BILLION IN SALES
"WOULD NOT PROVIDE A LIVEABLE
WAGE AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE
FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES?"
THERE'S NOWHERE AROUND
THAT THERE'S A COMPANY
THAT MAKES THIS MUCH MONEY
AND STILL TURNS AROUND
AND MAKES THEIR ASSOCIATES
GO TO THE STATE FOR AID.
Woman: I THINK MY COMPANY
TAKES FAMILY VERY SERIOUSLY.
THEY'LL HELP YOU ACHIEVE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY
ENDLESS AT WAL-MART.
THINK OF THE CAREERS
THAT GET STARTED IN THIS COMPANY
AND THE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO ME
JOBS THAT COME WITH OPPORTUNITY
FOR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT.
Noble: WHEN I FIRST STARTED
WORKING AT WAL-MART
I WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL.
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PLANS
TO GO TO COLLEGE LATER ON.
THE PEOPLE THAT I WAS WORKING
WITH WERE JUST SO NICE.
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT WAS AWESOME.
MY JOB FUNCTION AS A TIRE & LUBE
EXPRESS TECHNICIAN
IS PERFORMING AN OIL SERVICE
DOING TIRE CHANGES
BATTERY SERVICE
STOCKING THE INSIDE SHELVES
WRITING UP WORK ORDERS
AND GREETING THE CUSTOMER
RUNNING THE CASH REGISTER
RINGING PEOPLE OUT
FOR GROCERIES THEY BOUGHT
THROUGHOUT THE STORE
AND THEY WANT IT ALL DONE
AT THE SAME TIME.
ALL I'M WORRIED ABOUT
IS THE ONE 4% RAISE A YEAR
THAT YOU GET FROM WAL-MART.
I'VE WORKED THERE THREE YEARS
AND I HAVE GOTTEN
I THINK $1.07 RAISE.
I DON'T HAVE GOOD
HEALTH BENEFITS.
I CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE
ON MY OWN ANYMORE.
MOST OF IT IS THE POOR TREATMENT
FROM MANAGEMENT AT WAL-MART.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST WEIRD.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
KIND OF QUIET AND SHY.
AND NOW I KIND OF NEED TO STAND
UP FOR MYSELF AND MY COMMUNITY.
SO I JUST SEARCHED
THE INTERNET FOR A WHILE.
WHATEVER I TYPED IN
BROUGHT UP THE SAME THING.
I'D TYPE IN "EMPLOYEE RIGHTS."
IT WOULD BRING UP THE UNION.
"FAIR LABOR PRACTICE"
WOULD BRING UP THE UNION.
THESE CORPORATE PEOPLE
IN THE WAL-MART CORPORATION
DON'T EVEN REALLY LIKE
TO SAY THE WORD "UNION."
TO THEM IT'S A CURSE WORD.
"THIRD-PARTY REPRESENTATION"
IS THE WAY THEY PUT IT.
Lehman: WAL-MART IS VERY OPPOSED
TO UNIONS.
ONE OF THE MOST ANTI-
IF NOT THE MOST AGGRESSIVELY
ANTI-UNION COMPANY
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE UNITED STATES.
JUST RELENTLESS IN THEIR SEARCH
FOR UNION ACTIVITY
AND TRY TO SQUELCH IT KILL IT.
WE GOT A FEW.
ED DUPONTES.
HE GAVE YOU A CALL RIGHT?
HE GAVE ME A CALL
AND HE SAYS HE DIDN'T WANT
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNION.
HIS ANSWER WAS
"NO NO NO."
I HAD A WORKER THAT CAME TO ME
WITH A PIECE OF PAPER
THAT SOMEONE HAD TYPED UP
ON A COMPUTER.
IN BIG BOLD BLACK LETTERS
IT SAID "WE NEED A UNION."
NO SIGNATURES.
THAT'S ALL IT SAID.
THAT IN ITSELF IS ENOUGH TO
REQUIRE ME AS A STORE MANAGER
TO GO AND MAKE A PHONE CALL.
AND THE PHONE CALL
COMES TO BENTONVILLE.
AND THAT AFTERNOON I HAD TO
PERSONALLY DRIVE TO THE AIRPORT
AND PICK UP THREE GUYS THAT
FLEW IN IN A CORPORATE JET
AND PICK THEM UP AND BRING THEM
BACK TO MY STORE.
WE HAVE TO DO THIS
FOR THE REASONS WE STARTED IT.
Fortune: WHAT THEY DO
IS THEY BASICALLY WALK IN
AND TELL THE STORE MANAGER
"YOU'RE NO LONGER IN CHARGE
OF THIS STORE.
EVERY DECISION GOES THROUGH US."
Nicholson: THEY TAUGHT ME
HOW TO PROFILE PEOPLE.
OF COURSE I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS THE TERM THEN.
AND IT WAS IDENTIFYING PEOPLE
THAT WERE THE STRONGEST
REPRESENTERS
OF THE PETITION TO ORGANIZE
OR AT LEAST GET A VOTE.
ANITA WE NEED TO
CONTACT STILL.
POSSIBILITY THERE.
YOU WALK UP TO A COUPLE OF
ASSOCIATES AND THEY'RE TALKING.
THEY WALK AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.
THEY GOTTA GO.
THEY'RE CONSPIRING
TO DO SOMETHING.
Man: BE NOISY.
BE HAPPY.
BE BOISTEROUS.
WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT FOLKS
WHO ARE TRYING DESPERATELY
TO FIGHT AGAINST
THE WORLD'S LARGEST
RICHEST AND PROBABLY
MEANEST CORPORATION.
Fortune: THE ASSOCIATES
IN THE AUTOMOTIVE DEPARTMENT
WERE FLOODED WITH BRAINWASHING
MATERIAL AGAINST THE UNION.
I GOT FOOLED BY A UNION.
FOOLED BAD.
ALL THE UNION IS WORKING AT
IS TAKING A CUT OUT OF MY PAY.
YEAH TAKE YOUR MONEY
AND SPEND IT TO HELPING
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS
AND HELP PEOPLE
I DON'T EVEN VOTE FOR.
BECAUSE THEY KNOW A UNION
WOULD JUST MESS IT UP.
BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
JUST ASK THE ASSOCIATES
WORKING HERE IN THE BUILDING.
NOW I CAN'T GET WITHIN THE STORE
OF 50 FEET
BEFORE SOMEBODY
APPROACHES ME
OR THERE'S SOMEBODY
FOLLOWING ME AROUND THE STORE
Man: I WAS NEVER ALONE.
I WAS FOLLOWED WHEREVER I WENT.
TRULY THE MANAGERS
WOULD FOLLOW ME.
Lehman: DURING THE PROCESS
OF INTIMIDATING THEM
THEY MAKE
THEIR LIVES MISERABLE.
THEY DO ILLEGAL SURVEILLANCE.
THEY PUT CAMERAS UP
IN WORK STATIONS
WORK AREAS BREAK ROOMS.
YOU GOT A TARGET ON YOUR BACK.
EVERYBODY ELSE KNOW "I GOTTA
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PERSON
BECAUSE I CAN GET FIRED
FOR TALKING TO THIS PERSON."
THEY'RE TARGETING A LOT OF IT
AT JOSH.
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT JOSH
BEING HELD UP ON THEIR SHOULDERS
AND PARADED AROUND.
THEY'RE LIKE
"YEAH HE'S JUST USING IT
FOR A WAY TO GET ATTENTION."
Fortune: ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE
TACTICS IS TO SAY
"WE HAVE TO FREEZE
ALL THE RAISES
BECAUSE WE CAN'T APPEAR
TO BE BRIBING ANYBODY."
Kuc: IT WAS A GREAT POLITICAL
PLOY BY WAL-MART IN MY MIND
TO SAY THAT'S WHY
THEY WEREN'T GETTING RAISES.
SOME OF THOSE EMPLOYEES
STARTED PUTTING PRESSURE
ON THE TIRE & LUBE EXPRESS
PEOPLE
BECAUSE "WE CAN'T GET RAISES
BECAUSE OF YOU."
I WAS SO SCARED
TO GO TO THE BREAK ROOM
BECAUSE THEY MADE US ALL
GO TO BREAK TOGETHER
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY DEAD
AFTER THAT.
WE START WALKING THROUGH.
CUSTOMERS AND OTHER ASSOCIATES
WERE GIVING US DIRTY LOOKS.
I WAS LIKE "I'M NOT SITTING
IN THAT BREAK ROOM."
ALICIA'S GOOD.
ALICIA'S WAY GOOD.
YEAH.
TALKED WITH HER
QUITE A BIT.
AND WE KNOW CODY'S GOOD.
RIGHT.
CODY'S WITH US HERE.
IT STRUCK THE MANAGERS TO START
HIRING ASSOCIATES IN THE STORE.
AND WHAT THEY DO THIS FOR IS TO
TRY TO DISSOLVE THE PERCENTAGES
OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STORE
THAT ARE FOR THE UNION.
JAMES.
JAMES IS ANOTHER NEW HIRE.
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
WHO THAT IS.
YEAH.
BUT THIS IS OUR STORE.
THIS ISN'T THEIR STORE.
WE'RE MAKING THEM MONEY.
WE'RE THE LITTLE WORKER ANTS.
SO WHAT'S YOUR PREDICTION?
RIGHT NOW IT'S AT 50/50.
I MEAN
THE FEW PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE
ARE JUST GONNA MAKE
IT OR BREAK IT RIGHT NOW.
I THINK YOU LOST ALICIA.
NO. I'VE TALKED WITH HER
QUITE A BIT.
SHE'S JUST KIND
OF HARD-TO-READ-TYPE PERSON.
I HANG OUT WITH HER
ON THE WEEKENDS.
SHE'S DEFINITELY INTO IT.
SHE'S REAL STRONG.
I JUST BELIEVE
IT'S REALLY JUST GONNA GO DONE
'CAUSE CODY'S NOT VOTING.
RYAN'S NOT VOTING YES.
AND I'M STILL KIND OF...
I KIND OF REALLY DON'T WANT
TO VOTE BUT I KIND OF HAVE TO.
YOU'RE GETTING ALL FREAKED OUT
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA KNOW
HOW YOU VOTED.
ALL IT'S GONNA BE
IS A BUNCH OF NUMBERS RIGHT NOW.
SO WE'VE GOT 6 FOR A NO.
ANOTHER 6 YES.
SO WE'VE GOT 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 ON THE FENCE.
Lehman: THE COMPANY DOES
EVERYTHING THAT IT CAN
AND THAT MEANS ANYTHING.
THEY WILL KILL IT.
THEY'LL KILL THE CAMPAIGN.
WAL-MART WINNING OUT AS YOU
SAID 17-1 BUT THE UNION...
Fortune:
IT'S NOT A FAIR BATTLE.
IT'S NOT ACCORDING TO THE
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT.
BUT WHEN THEY FIND THAT
THERE'S A CAMPAIGN GOING ON
EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE --
FAIR UNFAIR LEGAL
MAYBE NOT-SO-LEGAL --
IS DONE TO KEEP THE UNION OUT.
Interpreter:
WAL-MART WAS VERY LUCKY
TO ACQUIRE
TWO REALLY GOOD COMPANIES.
BUT OF COURSE
THEY WERE ALREADY UNIONIZED.
WAL-MART HAD NO CHOICE.
Interpreter #2: BECAUSE OF THE
UNION WE GET 36 DAYS
OF VACATION A YEAR.
USUALLY PEOPLE TAKE 3 WEEKS
IN THE SUMMER
3 WEEKS IN THE SPRING.
IT DEPENDS.
YOU CAN SPLIT YOUR VACATIONS
INTO 2 OR 3 TIMES PER YEAR.
OR EVEN MORE OFTEN
IF YOU PREFER.
Interpreter #3:
MY JOB IS VERY IMPORTANT.
AND IF I HAVE TO FEAR
FOR MY JOB IT'S A BAD THING --
A VERY BAD THING.
IF WAL-MART SAYS
WE'RE ALL A BIG FAMILY
AND WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE
EVERYTHING'S GREAT
THEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THE COLLEAGUES IN AMERICA
CAN'T HAVE A WORKERS COUNCIL
CAN'T ESTABLISH A UNION.
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
Man: WAL-MART IS A CAREER.
IT'S NOT JUST A JOB.
GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE.
GOOD EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
FOR MY CHILDREN.
IT IS RIGHT FOR THE 1.2 MILLION
WAL-MART ASSOCIATES
INCLUDING MORE MINORITIES
AND MORE SENIORS THAT WORK IN
ANY OTHER COMPANY IN AMERICA.
WAL-MART OFFERS THE RIGHT JOB AT
THE RIGHT TIME IN THEIR LIVES
AND IT GIVES THEM A STEP UP
THAT ECONOMIC LADDER.
MY NAME IS EDITH ARANA.
I LIVE HERE
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
I HAVE TWO GIRLS.
I GO TO SCHOOL TO BE
A PRESCHOOL TEACHER.
I WORKED FOR WAL-MART
FOR SIX YEARS.
THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THE
DIFFERENT THINGS THEY OFFERED
AND THE TYPE OF COMPANY
WAL-MART WAS.
I SAID "THAT'S A COMPANY
I WANT TO WORK FOR."
I ALWAYS FOUND IT
REWARDING TO ME
TO HELP THE CUSTOMER
FIND WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.
I COULD WORK WONDERS.
"DO MORE WITH LESS.
"I KNOW THE TRUE MEANING
OF DO MORE WITH LESS.
"THEY WANT THE ASSOCIATES
TO DO MORE
AND THEY'RE GONNA
PAY THEM LESS."
THEY WOULD COME IN THE OFFICE
OR ON THE FLOOR.
IT DIDN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU WERE WORKING.
THEY WOULD SAY "WELL
YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO OVERTIME.
THERE IS TO BE NO OVERTIME
WHATSOEVER."
WE MAY HAVE FIVE BASKETS
OF MERCHANDISE
THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT BACK.
YOU MAY HAVE 30 MINUTES LEFT
ON YOUR 8-HOUR SHIFT.
"BUT WE NEED THOSE BASKETS
PUT AWAY."
AND THEY USUALLY DO IT
WITH A SMILE.
YOU WOULD GO ALONG WITH IT
BECAUSE YOU NEEDED THAT JOB.
AND THERE WAS NO IF
ANDS OR BUTS ABOUT IT.
THEY WOULD LET YOU KNOW
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
"IF YOU CAN'T DO IT I'LL JUST
GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT.
"YOU ARE NOT A PERSON
THAT CANNOT BE REPLACED.
AND WE'RE HIRING ALL THE TIME."
AND IN YOUR MIND YOU GO
"LOOK I GOT THESE KIDS AT HOME.
I'LL JUST HAVE TO MAKE
THAT SACRIFICE."
AND YOU WILL.
THEY ARE ASKED TO WORK
OFF THE CLOCK
WITH THE IMPLICATION THAT IF
THEY DON'T WORK OFF THE CLOCK
THAT IS WHAT IS EXPECTED
AT THIS PARTICULAR STORE
THEY ARE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOB.
AND THEY DO IT
AS A MATTER OF SURVIVAL.
AND IT COMES FROM THE TOP.
Woman: WAL-MART IS FIGHTING
LEGAL BATTLES
WITH SCORES OF FORMER EMPLOYEES
IN 31 STATES --
HOURLY WORKERS WHO SAY
THE COMPANY HAS CHEATED THEM
OUT OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN OVERTIME PAY.
THE WAL-MART CORPORATION
PAID APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION
TO SETTLE AN OFF-THE-CLOCK
CLASS-ACTION SUIT IN COLORADO.
IN TEXAS IT IS ESTIMATED
THAT THEY CHEATED WORKERS
OUT OF UP TO $150 MILLION
IN UNPAID WAGES.
OUR POLICY IS THAT WE PAY
EVERYONE FOR EVERY HOUR WORKED.
YOU'RE THE CEO OF WAL-MART.
THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO?
"IF YOU WORK HERE
WE'LL PAY YOU."
THAT'S IT?
"WORK AT WAL-MART.
IT'S BETTER THAN
GETTING KICKED IN THE NUTS."
OUR DISTRICT MANAGER
EXPLAINED TO US
HOW TO CHEAT WORKERS
OUT OF OVERTIME.
HE SAID "THIS IS HOW YOU CAN
COME IN ON YOUR PAYROLL BUDGET
FOR THIS WEEK."
IF YOU HAD SAY
3 WORKERS THAT HAD OVERTIME --
MAYBE AN HOUR OR EVEN
20 MINUTES OVER 40 HOURS.
HE EXPLAINED TO US HOW TO GO IN
THE SYSTEM UNDER A FALSE USER ID
TO GET INTO THE COMPUTER AND
MOVE THAT TIME TO THE NEXT WEEK.
I'VE SEEN MANAGERS GO IN WHEN
SOMEONE WORKED 41 42 HOURS
AND CHANGE IT TO 40 HOURS.
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING
TO JUST LIVE ON THE BASICS
EVERY DAY OR DO WITHOUT
NEED THAT EXTRA MINUTE OR TWO
ON THEIR PAYCHECK.
AND THOSE ARE THE ONES
THAT ARE VICTIMIZED THE MOST.
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
THAT DID IT.
I SEEN EVERY MANAGER EXCEPT
FOR ONE GENERAL MANAGER DO IT.
Man: WAL-MART REFUSES TO FOLLOW
THE VERY AMERICAN ETHIC
THAT HAS SERVED THE COUNTRY WELL
FOR MANY YEARS.
PEOPLE SHOULD BE PAID
FOR THE WORK THEY DO.
Man #2: WAL-MART CURRENTLY FACES
LAWSUITS IN 31 DIFFERENT STATES
FOR WAGE AND HOUR ABUSES
POTENTIALLY INVOLVING HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS.
AS A STORE MANAGER
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR REDUCING YOUR EXPENSES
EVERY SINGLE MONTH.
AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO KEEP
THE ASSOCIATES' NUMBERS DOWN.
Woman: I WAS JUST GETTING
ABOUT 19 HOURS A WEEK.
THAT'S JUST...
YOU CAN'T PAY BILLS WITH THAT.
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT AT ALL.
IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING THOSE
FULL-TIME HOURS FOR THAT WEEK
THAT'S DEVASTATING.
IT MAY HELP THEM
ON THEIR BOTTOM LINE
BUT IT DOESN'T HELP YOU
AT HOME.
WHEN IT COMES TO JOBS
WE HAVE GOOD JOBS.
74% OF OUR PEOPLE ARE FULL-TIME.
MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA
DON'T KNOW THAT.
ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
WAL-MART CONSIDERS FULL-TIME
EMPLOYMENT 28 HOURS A WEEK
WHICH AT THEIR STARTING WAGE
WORKS OUT
TO UNDER $12000 A YEAR.
Man: I.N.S. AGENTS ARRESTED
250 UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS
IN 61 WAL-MARTS ACROSS AMERICA.
WAL-MART IS PAYING $11 MILLION
TO SETTLE FEDERAL ALLEGATIONS
IT USED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
TO CLEAN ITS STORES.
I'M STUNNED THAT THEY WOULD
EMPLOY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
VERY STUNNED.
YOU'RE STUNNED THEY HIRE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS FOR NEARLY NO PAY?
LADY YOU JUST BOUGHT
A SWEATSHIRT THERE FOR $.29.
WAL-MART
THE WORLD'S LARGEST RETAILER
COULD BE FACING
THE LARGEST LAWSUIT
EVER BROUGHT AGAINST
A PRIVATE EMPLOYER.
LAWYERS SUING WAL-MART
WILL FILE THEIR MOTION TODAY.
IF A JUDGE AGREES
THE COMPANY COULD BE FACING
A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT
FOR DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST 1.6 MILLION CURRENT
AND FORMER FEMALE EMPLOYEES.
I HAD NO IDEA
ABOUT THE LAWSUIT.
THERE WERE PEOPLE IN MY STORE
THAT HAD NO IDEA ABOUT IT ALSO.
MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT IN THE UPPER
ECHELONS OF WAL-MART MANAGEMENT
TALK ABOUT HOW WOMEN AT WAL-MART
ARE USELESS.
I HAVE DONE RECEIVING MANAGER.
I WAS OPERATION MANAGER.
I WAS MERCHANDISE MANAGER.
SO IT'S LIKE
I KIND OF DID IT ALL.
I CLEANED THE BATHROOM
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
KEN WOULD COME TO ME AND SAY
"IT'S YOUR TURN AGAIN."
I'D SAY TO HIM
"IT WAS MY TURN YESTERDAY."
AND HE'D LAUGH
AND WE'D JOKE ABOUT IT.
WE'D GO BACK AND FORTH.
I'D SAY "I KNOW. I'M THE ONLY
FEMALE THAT'S WORKING OUT HERE.
SO HENCE I HAVE TO CLEAN
THE BATHROOM."
NOBODY SAID "WELL WHY A WOMAN
BEEN IN THIS COMPANY
ALL OF THESE YEARS?"
YOU LOOK AT THE EVALUATION.
EVERY GENERAL MANAGER STATED
"SHE SHOULD BE A G.M.
WITHIN A YEAR."
"WITHIN 6 MONTHS."
EVERY EVALUATION.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?
THE COMPANY HIDES THE FACT
THAT THESE PRACTICES
ARE VERY SYSTEMIC.
THEY'RE SYSTEMIC MEANING THEY
COME OUT OF THE HOME OFFICE.
BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WERE
A FEMALE YOU WEREN'T WORTH IT.
YOU JUST WEREN'T WORTH
THE TIME.
YOU WEREN'T WORTH THE MONEY.
YOU WEREN'T WORTH THE EFFORT --
NOTHING.
A BLIND MAN.
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS BLIND.
SHE COULD SEE BETTER
THAN WHAT YOU GUYS ARE SEEING.
BECAUSE YOU PUT THE BLINDERS ON.
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE.
WHEN I CALLED
I CALLED TO FILE A PETITION
OR TO FILE A CLAIM
AGAINST THEM
JUST TO SAY THAT
THEY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ME
BECAUSE I WAS A WOMAN.
I'M BETTY.
I'M A WAL-MART ASSOCIATE.
I LOVE WORKING AT WAL-MART.
I LOVE THAT THEY PAY ME
LESS THAN MEN
BECAUSE THAT MEANS
I CAN'T AFFORD TO EAT AS MUCH
AND I GET TO KEEP MY FIGURE.
JIM GOT PROMOTED TO MANAGEMENT
OVER ME BUT THAT'S OKAY
BECAUSE HE'S A CUTIE.
YOU GO GET THEM HONEY.
WHEN I APPLIED FOR THE ASSISTANT
MANAGER TRAINING PROGRAM
I DIDN'T GET ANY RESPONSE
BACK AT ALL.
I WENT THROUGH EVERYTHING
I HAD DONE FOR MY STORE MANAGER.
AND I HAD DONE IT LIKE
YOU WOULD DO A CHECK LIST.
SAID "YOU TOLD ME TO DO THIS.
I DID IT."
"YOU TOLD ME TO DO THIS.
I DID IT."
HE AGREED WITH A NOD.
AND I SAID "NOW I WANT
WHAT YOU PROMISED ME."
HE JUST BLUNTLY TOLD ME
"THERE'S NO PLACE FOR PEOPLE
LIKE YOU IN MANAGEMENT."
AND I SAID "WELL WHAT DO YOU
MEAN PEOPLE LIKE ME?"
AND I SAID TO HIM "THAT I'M
A WOMAN OR THAT I'M BLACK?"
HE SAID "WELL TWO OUT OF TWO
AIN'T BAD."
I WAS CALLED "MILKBOY"
"NIGGER"
AT THIS PARTICULAR STORE.
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT
WHERE THIS ONE GUY'S BICYCLE
THEY HUNG IT UP IN THE CEILING
AND PUT A ROPE AROUND IT.
YOU KNOW LITERARY LYNCHED
THIS GUY'S BICYCLE.
I COMPLAINED BECAUSE
TO ME IT WAS OFFENSIVE.
AND IT WAS UNACCEPTABLE.
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?
NOTHING.
I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS MORE
DEVASTATED THAN HUMILIATED
BUT IN MY MIND
THE WAY I LOVE PEOPLE
I JUST COULDN'T SEE
ANOTHER PERSON
MAYBE THEY ARE NOT STRONG
AS I AM
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT.
THIS WOMAN WALKED
THROUGH THE HALLWAY AND SAID
"EENIE MEENIE MINNIE MOE
CATCH A NIGGER BY THE TOE."
I REPORTED THIS INCIDENT.
NOTHING HAPPENED.
IF YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT
DISCRIMINATION
THEY'LL JUST LET MORE PEOPLE
OUT ON YOU
TO SEE IF THEY CAN REALLY WORK
YOU OUT OF THERE OR WHATEVER.
AND THAT'S BASICALLY
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.
I JUST GOT TIRED.
I STARTED GOING BACKWARDS IN MY
MIND OF ALL THE DIFFERENT STUFF
AND IT STARTED CLICKING
AND CLICKING
AND THE MORE I THOUGHT
THE WORSE I FELT.
BECAUSE I FELT TO MYSELF
"YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
HOW COULD YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN?"
I WAS DEVASTATED.
THE TIME THAT I SPENT
ON THOSE ROADS
I COULD'VE BEEN AT HOME
WITH MY HUSBAND.
BUT I WASN'T.
BECAUSE I WAS DOING MY END
OF WHAT WAL-MART PROMISED ME.
"IF YOU DO THIS
WE WILL DO THIS."
AND IT WAS NOT WORTH
MY HUSBAND'S LIFE.
AND THE WORST PART ABOUT IT IS
IS THAT NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW
HOW BIG THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE.
THERE'S GOT TO BE
MORE PEOPLE LIKE ME OUT THERE
BUT THEY'RE TOO AFRAID
TO SAY ANYTHING.
Woman: I LOVE MY JOB.
IT'S CHALLENGING
BUT IT'S REALLY SATISFYING.
WE TRULY ARE LIVING
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
IT'S OUT THERE
AND IT'S AT WAL-MART.
GREAT CITIZENSHIP ALSO MEANS
THAT WE'RE GONNA SUPPORT
THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE IN
THROUGH OUR CHARITIES
AND THE ORGANIZATIONS
THAT EXIST THERE.
Red: YOU KNOW THE TIME
I WAS BORN COUNTING HOOVER
I HAVE LIVED UNDER ABOUT 36%
OF THE PRESIDENTS
OF THE UNITED STATES.
THINK ABOUT THAT.
HOOVER AND ROOSEVELT
TRUMAN EISENHOWER
KENNEDY JOHNSON NIXON FORD
JIMMY CARTER
RONALD REAGAN BILL CLINTON
SENIOR BUSH AND JUNIOR BUSH.
SO THERE'S 13 PRESIDENTS
OUT OF 43 I'VE LIVED UNDER.
WE CAME HERE IN 1959
AND STARTED THE I.G.A. STORE
WHICH IS INDEPENDENT GROCERS.
WE HAD APPROXIMATELY
150 EMPLOYEES.
AND OF THESE 150 EMPLOYEES
THE FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES --
AND THAT WAS A GREAT NUMBER
OF THEM --
HAD FULL COVERAGE ON INSURANCE
HEALTH INSURANCE.
WE ALSO HAD 401(k) PENSION PLAN
THAT THEY REALLY APPRECIATED.
IN SMALL FAMILY-OWNED
BUSINESSES
YOU DO BECOME ATTACHED
TO YOUR EMPLOYEES
AND THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT
TO YOU.
WE ALWAYS TRIED TO HAVE
A CHRISTMAS PARTY
OR CHRISTMAS DINNER
WHERE ALL THE EMPLOYEES CAME
AND WE'D CLOSE THE STORES.
Jordan:
AND EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL
I'D GET OFF THE BUS AND RUN UP
TO THE STORE
'CAUSE WE LIVED
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS UP FROM IT.
Red: THE BAILER THAT WE USE HERE
IS A BAILER
THAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM WHEN WE
CLOSED DOWN THE STORES...
...IN THE LATE '90s.
Scott:
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S FAIR
THE WAY THAT WAL-MART
CAN COME IN
WITH THE FUNDING
THAT THEY GET.
TO PUT THEIR SEWERS
INFRASTRUCTURE
ROAD PARKING SIGNALS
INGRESS EGRESS ETC.
COMPARED TO WHAT
THE INDEPENDENT RETAILER GETS.
NO I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S FAIR.
CERTAINLY IT'S NOT FAIR
AND I THINK HE AT ONE TIME
DID GO TALK TO THEM
IN CAMERON AND SAY
"IF WE'RE GONNA RUN A BUSINESS
HERE CAN YOU HELP US?"
WELL NO THEY COULDN'T DO THAT.
Red: I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR
TO HELP THEM
TO BUILD ROADS
FOR THEIR BUSINESS
AND AT THE SAME TIME
THE STORE OPENS
PUTS OTHERS OUT OF BUSINESS.
THE COMPETITION
THAT WE'RE UP AGAINST
REALLY HASN'T CAUSED
A PROBLEM
AS MUCH AS THE COMPETITION
BEING HELPED
BY OUR GOVERNMENT.
FROM ONE LEVEL TO THE OTHER
THEY GET ALL THE BREAKS.
WAL-MART IS COMING IN
AND RUNNING US OUT.
WE KNOW YOU HELPED THEM
OR YOU GAVE THEM TAX ABATEMENTS.
WILL YOU GIVE US
A TAX ABATEMENT?
NO THEY COULDN'T DO THAT.
SO YOU KNOW THE COUNTY
NOR THE CITY WOULD DO THAT.
AND OF COURSE
EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS UNFAIR
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?
MAYBE... WELL THERE
IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.
SEWER WATER ANY OF THAT STUFF
AS FAR AS I KNOW WE NEVER
RECEIVED ONE DIME FROM THE CITY
COUNTY OR ANY PLACE LIKE THAT.
IF YOU TELL THEM
THAT YOU DON'T WANT THEM
IN YOUR CITY LIMITS
THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING
TO STOP THEM
FROM BUYING FIVE ACRES
OUT HERE
OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS
POPPING THEIR BUILDING DOWN
HOOKING UP TO RURAL WATER
AND HAVING ALL THE NEGATIVE
EFFECTS ON THE CITY
AND NONE OF
THE POSITIVE EFFECTS.
Red: THEY HAVE A SUPERCENTER
IN CAMERON.
IT TOOK ABOUT 40%
OF OUR BUSINESS IN CAMERON
AND ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR
BUSINESS HERE IN HAMILTON.
IN BROOKFIELD IT TOOK OVER 50%
OF OUR BUSINESS OVERNIGHT.
Dee: IT'S HARD TO MAKE
THOSE PAYMENTS
WITH OUR WHOLESALER
HAVING PROBLEMS.
SO EVERYTHING JUST KIND OF
CULMINATED
IN EVERYBODY HAVING PROBLEMS.
TO PAY THE EMPLOYEES WE USED
CASH FROM THE INVENTORY.
AND THEN YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANY INVENTORY.
Ernest:
IN THE PROCESS OF ALL THIS
I HAD TO BORROW MONEY TO PUT
IN THE STORES
WITH THE FARM AS COLLATERAL.
IT WENT DOWN FROM THERE
SO WE HAD NO RECOURSE
BUT TO JUST CLOSE THEM UP.
IT WAS 40 YEARS OF HARD WORK
AND SEEING IT DISAPPEAR
ALL AT ONCE
IT WASN'T A VERY EASY THING
TO ADJUST TO
BUT...
AND NOW YOU CAN SEE
HERB IS STILL SADDENED A LOT.
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T
WHAT HE PLANNED.
BUT WE HAD A LOT OF GOOD TIMES.
HE DID A LOT THINGS.
HE KNOWS LOTS OF PEOPLE.
AND THEY RESPECT HIM.
AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT...
I CLOSED THAT STORE
AND THAT WAS A SUNDAY MORNING.
I'D WENT DOWN TO OPEN AND...
JUST...
YEAH I REMEMBER HIM
COMING DOWN THE STAIRS
AND SAT DOWN ON THE COUCH
AND MOM TOLD ME.
AND I STARTED CRYING.
IT WAS LIKE A FAMILY MEMBER.
WE WERE THERE EVERY DAY.
IT WAS A BIG PART OF OUR LIFE.
IT WAS PROBABLY
MY FAVORITE PLACE.
I LIKED BEING THERE.
THEY WANTED IT FROM ME.
AND I LOVE THEM TO DEATH FOR IT.
BUT YOU KNOW THEY WANTED
IT FROM ME AND MY FAMILY.
AND IF WAL-MART STILL GAINS
GROUND AND HAVE A MONOPOLY
WHERE WILL OUR FAMILIES
AND WHERE WILL OUR CHILDREN BE?
AND WHAT WILL THEY HAVE TO DO
TO WORK AND TO BE COMPETITIVE
AND IN TEN YEARS
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO GET TO BE
VERY VERY SERIOUS
FOR THE NATION.
IT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT WAY NOW.
I HOPE IT DON'T
FOR OUR CHILDREN'S SAKE
BUT IT COULD BE...
IT COULD BE REAL SERIOUS
BE A REVOLUTION.
I WON'T SAY IT WOULD BE
A CIVIL WAR
BUT IT WOULD BE A REVOLUTION.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
WANTS THAT.
I'M KIM ROSSETTA AND I'M A 4th
AND 5th GRADE BILINGUAL TEACHER
IN DENVER COLORADO
IN THE DENVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS
AT NEWLON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
WAL-MART RECEIVED SUBSIDIES
OF ABOUT $1.7 MILLION
AND WITH THAT $1.7 MILLION
OUR DENVER METROPOLITAN AREA
THAT COULD HAVE KEPT
THE THREE SCHOOLS
THAT WE JUST CLOSED DOWN
THIS SPRING OPEN.
I AM MONICA JEFFERSON.
I AM A SPEECH-LANGUAGE
PATHOLOGIST.
AND I WORK
FOR SPECIAL SCHOOL DISTRICT
OF ST. LOUIS COUNTY.
WAL-MART RECEIVES
OVER $31 MILLION IN SUBSIDY
FROM THE MISSOURI GOVERNMENT.
CATHEDRAL CITY MADE
A $1.8 MILLION INVESTMENT
BUT BECAUSE OF WAL-MART'S LIES
AND NOT STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE
WITH THEIR COMMITMENTS
WE'RE SHORT ON POLICEMEN
WE'RE SHORT ON FIREMEN.
WE'VE ELIMINATED THE RECREATION
DIVISION OF THIS CITY.
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE
THE SERVICES TO OUR RESIDENTS
THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LIVES
HANGING IN THE BALANCE
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES.
MY NAME IS CHARLES HUSSEY.
I HAVE BEEN A 4th GRADE TEACHER
IN WASHINGTON STATE FOR MANY YEARS.
WHEN I THINK OF THE MILLION
DOLLARS THAT WAL-MART RECEIVED
FOR ITS DISTRIBUTION CENTER
AND WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE
THERE FOR STUDENTS
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
TAKING REVENUE AWAY
FROM OUR COMMUNITY
THAT WILL HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT
ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO
PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF SERVICE.
IN ILLINOIS
WAL-MART HAS RECEIVED
$100 MILLION IN SUBSIDIES
AND THAT HAS AFFECTED
OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS.
THAT MONEY COULD GO INTO
OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS
TO REHIRE ALL OF THOSE SUPPORT
TEACHERS THAT WE NEED BACK
THE SUPPORT PERSONNEL.
WE COULD HAVE
OUR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS BACK
OUR SOCIAL WORKERS BACK
OUR COUNSELORS BACK.
WE COULD PICK UP...
THESE PROGRAMS ARE BEING CUT
BECAUSE WAL-MART
HAS RECEIVED SUBSIDIES.
NOW WHAT WE'RE FACING CURRENTLY
IS THAT WAL-MART AND SAM'S CLUB
WHICH ARE THE SAME PEOPLE
HAVE IN FACT
FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES
DECIDED THAT THEY ARE GOING
TO LEAVE OUR COMMUNITY.
AND NOT MOVING 20 MILES AWAY
THEY WERE MOVING 2 MILES AWAY.
Sowles: ONE IS BEING BUILT RIGHT
ON THE PROPERTY LINE OF OUR CITY
WHICH WE STILL WILL NOT RECEIVE
ANY BENEFIT FROM.
Pettis:
JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS.
SO JUST AS WE WERE ABOUT
TO BEGIN TO RECEIVE A 100%
OF THE SALES-TAX REVENUE
FROM THAT DEAL
WE FOUND OUT
THAT WE HAD BEEN THE CHUMP.
TO END UP WITH A VACANT BUILDING
OF THE SIZE
THAT MOST BUSINESSES CAN'T FILL.
SO YOU HAVE A HUGE BUILDING
THAT SITS VACANT
FOR MONTHS AND YEARS.
Woman: THAT'S WHY AT WAL-MART WE
GIVE BACK FIVE DOLLARS EVERY SECOND
TO THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE
THROUGHOUT THE HOLIDAYS
AND ALL YEAR LONG...
TO MAKE THE SEASON
AND EVERY DAY A LITTLE BRIGHTER.
RESPONSIBLE CITIZENSHIP
ALSO MEANS LOOKING OUT
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IN THIS AREA'S SUSTAINABILITY.
Lisenby: ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING
THINGS ABOUT A RIVERKEEPER ORGANIZATION
IS WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC.
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF VOLUNTEERS
THAT VOLUNTEER TO KEEP
THEIR PART OF THE CATAWBA RIVER.
BECAUSE THE CATAWBA RIVER
IS DAMMED 11 TIMES
AND IT HAS 11 LAKES ON IT
WE HAVE LAKES WITH COVES
AND SO WE CALL
OUR VOLUNTEERS COVE-KEEPERS.
AND THESE COVE-KEEPERS
WORK TO SAFEGUARD AND PROTECT
THE CATAWBA RIVER.
ESSENTIALLY
WE DID AN INVESTIGATION
AND WE VISITED
ABOUT SEVEN WAL-MARTS
IN THE CATAWBA RIVER VALLEY
TO SEE WHAT THEIR
ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES WERE
AND JUDGE WHETHER THEIR CURRENT
ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES
WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT
ON THE DRINKING WATER
IN THE TOWN OF BELMONT.
WHAT WE FOUND
IN EVERY SINGLE CASE
IS THAT WAL-MART HAD A PRACTICE
OF STORING HERBICIDES
PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS
IN THE PARKING LOTS.
WHAT CONCERNED US MOST
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR CASE
WAS THE PROXIMITY
OF THIS WAL-MART
AND THE CREEK RUNNING
RIGHT BY THE WAL-MART SITE
AND THAT CREEK EMPTIES RIGHT
HERE AT THE INTAKE SITE.
FOR ME WHEN I'M OUT ON PATROL
AND ON THE RIVER
AND THERE'S A DRINKING-WATER
INTAKE RIGHT THERE
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT THERE IS
A MOM SOMEWHERE
WHO'S AT A KITCHEN SINK
AND SHE'S PUTTING WATER
IN A BOTTLE
TO MAKE FORMULA FOR HER BABY.
AND THAT BABY IS DRINKING...
THE LABELS ON SOME OF THE
HERBICIDES AND PESTICIDES SAID
"THIS PRODUCT KNOWN
TO CAUSE REPRODUCTIVE HARM
BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
AND BIRTH DEFECTS."
THESE PALLETS WITH BAGS AND BAGS
OF THIS MATERIAL
MANY OF THEM BROKEN AND BUSTED
AND SPILLING ON THE PAVEMENT
EVERY TIME IT RAINED
ALL THIS MATERIAL
WAS WASHING
RIGHT INTO THE STORM WATER
AND EVENTUALLY MAKING ITS WAY
HERE TO THE CATAWBA RIVER
THE SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER
FOR ALMOST 2 MILLION PEOPLE
IN THE REGION.
SO WE BEGAN CALLING WAL-MART
TO REALLY EXPRESS OUR CONCERN
ABOUT THESE CHEMICALS MAKING
ITS WAY
INTO THE PUBLIC DRINKING WATER.
AND THEY GAVE ME A NAME
AND A PHONE NUMBER
OF SOMEBODY IN ARKANSAS
HEADQUARTERS TO CALL.
THAT PERSON WHEN I TALKED TO
HIM WASN'T THE RIGHT PERSON.
THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T THINK
THEY HAD AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSON
THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF HANDLING
ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS
BUT THEY WOULD TRY AND FIND OUT.
THEY NEVER CALLED.
SO AGAIN I CALLED BACK.
THIS TIME I CALLED
THEIR ATTORNEYS.
I CALLED THE CONTACT NAME
THEY GAVE ME AND SAID
"LOOK I AM NOT GETTING
ANY ANSWER
"FROM ANYONE
AT CORPORATE WAL-MART
"AND BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
I AM GOING TO START A WEBLOG
"AND EVERY CONTACT I HAVE
WITH YOU
"I'M GOING TO PUT
ON MY WEB SITE
"AND REPORT
WHAT YOUR RESPONSE IS.
"AND IF THERE'S NO RESPONSE
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE
ON OUR WEBSITE."
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID.
TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER
THEY STILL DIDN'T CALL BACK.
WE THEN SENT THEM THE LAW.
AND I ELEVATED THE RHETORIC
AND SAID "IT APPEARS TO US
"AS IF YOU ARE
VIOLATING THE STORAGE LAWS.
WE ARE GETTING READY
TO CONTACT OUR ATTORNEYS."
STILL NO ONE CALLED.
FINALLY THE ATTORNEYS
FOR WAL-MART
WHO HAD TESTIFIED
IN THE HEARING
GAVE ME THE NAME OF A PERSON
THAT THEY THOUGHT
WAS THEIR CONTACT.
I FINALLY REACHED THAT PERSON
AT WAL-MART HEADQUARTERS
IN ARKANSAS
AND HE SAID
HE HAD JUST STARTED THE JOB.
HE HAD BEEN IN TRAINING
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL ME.
SO AT THIS TIME
I STARTED CALLING THE NEWS MEDIA
AND ASKING THEM TO DO A STORY.
WE GOT A GREAT
LOCAL NEWS STATION
HERE IN CHARLOTTE
NORTH CAROLINA
THAT RESPONDED ON CAMERA
SHOWING THESE PALLETS
AND PALLETS AND PALLETS
OF CHEMICALS HERBICIDES
FERTILIZERS
STORED IN THE PARKING LOTS
RIGHT BESIDE
THE STORM-WATER DRAIN.
IT RAN IN THE MORNING
THE NOON TIME
THE 6:00 AND THE EVENING NEWS
ON THAT DAY.
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT THE WAL-MART MANAGER
FOR THE LOCAL STORE
WHERE MOST OF THE VIDEO
WAS SHOT
THAT HAD 81 PALLETS OF THI
MATERIAL OUT IN THE PARKING LOT
SAW THE STORY.
CALLED HIS REGIONAL MANAGER
FIRST THING THE NEXT DAY AND SAID
"YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW
ON THE NEWS LAST NIGHT."
AND FOR ALL HIS STORES
IN THE REGION
HE HAD THEM PULL THOSE CHEMICALS
FROM THE PARKING LOTS
AND PUT THEM UNDER COVER.
AS I READ THE CASE HISTORY
ON ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL FINDS
AND PARTICULARLY
THE CONSENT DECREES
FROM THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL'S OFFICE
ORDERING WAL-MART TO ESTABLISH
BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
WHAT FLABBERGASTED ME MOST
ABOUT THE LACK OF
CORPORATE RESPONSE
IS THEIR APPARENT DISREGARD
FOR THESE CONSENT DECREES
AND THAT THEY HADN'T TAKEN THEM
VERY SERIOUSLY.
IT'S ONLY THE LOCAL GUYS.
I CAN SAY IN MY HISTORY
AS RIVERKEEPER
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
ENCOUNTERED A CORPORATION
BE IT A POWER COMPANY
AN OIL COMPANY
AS UNRESPONSIVE AS WAL-MART.
WILDLIFE CONSERVATION
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
BUT IT'S REALLY EXCITING
WHEN A COMPANY LIKE WAL-MART
MAKES IT A PRIORITY TOO.
WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.
THEY HAVE TREATED US VERY FAIRLY
IN WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.
THEY ACTUALLY
MUCH LIKE IN THE U.S.
THEY HOLD US
TO A HIGHER STANDARD --
HIGHER STANDARD OF SANITATION
HIGHER STANDARD OF EMPLOYMENT.
Interpreter:
MY NAME IS WANG QI.
I'M 21 YEARS OLD.
I'M FROM THE SHANGHAI PROVINCE.
MY FAMILY PLANTS CORN
PADDIES AND POTATO.
I WANTED TO EARN SOME MONEY
SO THAT THEIR LIFE
COULD BE EASIER.
AT LEAST I DIDN'T WANT
THEIR LIFE TO BE TOO HARD.
THEY WOULD WORK
FROM DAWN TILL NIGHT.
THEY WOULD BEGIN TO WORK
ON THE FARM AT DAYBREAK
AND WOULDN'T GET BACK
UNTIL NIGHT.
I THOUGHT ABOUT WORKING
IN THE FACTORY
WHEN I WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.
AT THE TIME I THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING
AND EXCITING TO WORK
IN THE FACTORY.
I LEFT MY HOMETOWN
ON APRIL 29th THIS YEAR
AND THEN BEGAN TO LOOK FOR A JOB
IN SHENZHEN.
AT THAT TIME I HAD A FRIEND
WORKING IN THAT FACTORY
WHO ALSO CAME FROM MY HOMETOWN.
SO I WENT TO SEE MY FRIEND
EACH DAY AT THE FACTORY GATE
WHICH IS JUST IN FRONT
OF WIEN YIE'S ROOM.
Interpreter #2:
MY NAME IS WIEN YIE
AND I COME FROM HUNAN PROVINCE
.
Interpreter #1:
HE HEARD MY DIALECT WHEN
I WAS TALKING WITH MY FRIEND
.
THEN HE SPOKE WITH ME
USING THE SAME DIALECT.
HE ASKED ME WHERE I WAS FROM.
I DIDN'T TELL HIM THE TRUTH.
I SAID I WAS FROM
THE CHUNGKING AREA.
HE SERVED FOR THE ARMY IN
CHUNGKING FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS
SO HE CAN SPEAK
THE CHUNGKING DIALECT.
THAT'S THE WAY
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
Interpreter #2:
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WORK
IN THE SAME WAL-MART FACTORY.
SHE WORKS IN THE OLD WORKSHOP
AND I WORK IN THE NEW ONE.
I AM ON THE NIGHT SHIFT AND FINISH
WORK AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING.
SHE BEGINS TO WORK
AT 7:30 EACH MORNING
AND WORKS OVERTIME
UNTIL 10:00 P.M.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
TO SPEND TOGETHER
BUT WHENEVER THERE IS
AN OPPORTUNITY
I'LL COOK SOME DELICIOUS FOOD
FOR HER.
Interpreter #1: WE LIKE SINGING
KARAOKE SHOPPING AROUND
AND BUYING SOME LITTLE THINGS.
AND THAT WAY
YOU FEEL MORE RELAXED.
MOST OF THE TIMES
WE GO TO KARAOKE
SING SONGS AND LISTEN TO MUSIC
AND WE GET IN A GOOD MOOD.
WE TEND TO RENT A ROOM OUTSIDE
AND COOK BY OURSELVES
BECAUSE THE MEALS OFFERED
BY THE FACTORY
ARE REALLY DISGUSTING.
HOWEVER THE DILEMMA IS
WHETHER YOU LIVE IN THE DORM
THAT THE FACTORY ALLOCATED
OR NOT
THEY ALWAYS DEDUCT
THE RENT FROM OUR WAGES.
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO LIVE INSIDE.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE
OUT OF THE DORM
THE FACTORY WILL TELL YOU
"YOU CAN MOVE OUT
"AND WE WILL NOT
CHARGE YOU ELECTRICITY OR WATER.
BUT RENT WILL STILL BE CHARGED."
YOU SEE IF WE LIVE
INSIDE THE DORM
WE PAY NOT ONLY THE RENT
BUT ALSO THE UTILITIES
WHICH IS CHARGED
BY HOW MUCH YOU USE.
THERE ARE VERY FEW FANS
INSTALLED IN MY WORKSHOP.
IT'S EXTREMELY HOT INSIDE.
IF THEY PLAN TO INSTALL
A NEW FAN
THEN THE OTHERS WILL TELL US
THAT WE CAN ONLY HAVE ONE FAN
OR THE FANS THAT ARE THERE.
IN MY WORKING POSITION
THERE IS NO WIND AT ALL.
CAN YOU IMAGINE
I'M SITTING THERE
AND DRIPPING WITH SWEAT
ALL DAY LONG.
MY BODY NEVER GETS DRY.
Interpreter #2:
WAL-MART INFORMED THE FACTORY
THAT IT WAS GOING TO SEND PEOPLE
HERE FOR THE INSPECTION
AND THEY WILL TELL US
HOW TO LIE FOR THE INSPECTOR.
FOR EXAMPLE
THE WORKERS MUST RESPOND
AS THOUGH THEY WORK 6 DAYS
WHEN ASKED HOW MANY DAYS
THEY WORK
EVEN THOUGH THEY ACTUALLY
WORK FOR 7 DAYS.
Interpreter #1: THEN WE WORKERS
DON'T DARE TO SAY ANYTHING WRONG
BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY AFRAID
OF BEING PUNISHED BY MANAGERS.
WAL-MART INFORMS US IN ADVANCE
AND HAS A MEETING TO TEACH US
HOW TO LIE.
IF YOU LIE WELL
YOU'LL BE REWARDED.
IF NOT YOU'LL BE PUNISHED
OR FIRED.
THE WORKER IS GIVEN
A FAKE PAY SLIP.
AND THEY NEVER LET YOU HAVE
THE CHANCE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
BUT THREATEN YOU TO DELIVER
FALSE INFORMATION.
WE REALLY WORK DAY AND NIGHT
IN ORDER TO GET THE WAGE OF LESS
THAN THREE DOLLARS A DAY.
MY MOM WANTS ME BACK HOME
BECAUSE SHE FEELS
IT'S TOO TOILSOME.
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.
EVERYBODY ELSE HERE
HAS THE SAME SITUATION AS ME.
IF THEY CAN DO THIS
I CAN DO IT ALSO.
I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT MY MOM
WHEN I'M VERY TIRED.
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL
IF SHE COULD BE HERE WITH ME.
SHE TAKES CARE OF ME
VERY WELL WHEN I'M SICK.
SHE'LL LET ME HAVE A GOOD REST
AND COOKS ANYTHING
THAT I'D LIKE TO EAT.
SHE'S REALLY VERY NICE TO ME.
Interpreter: I WOULD
RESPECTFULLY LIKE TO ASK
THE BOSS OF WAL-MART
TO GIVE THE CHINESE WORKERS
SOME CONSIDERATION
AND A CHANCE
FOR A LITTLE TIME OFF.
Interpreter #2:
CUSTOMERS OF WAL-MART
WHEN YOU WEAR EXPENSIVE CLOTHES
WHEN YOUR CHILDREN PLAY
WITH HIGH-QUALITY TOYS
THINK ABOUT CHINA
AND THE FAR EAST.
Interpreter #3:
THOSE PROFITS YOU MADE
AND THE WONDERFUL LIFE YOU HAVE
ARE THE SWEAT AND TEARS
AND OVERTIME WORKING
OF CHINESE PEOPLE.
IF ONE DAY I ENCOUNTER A LADY
WHO JUST BOUGHT A TOY
FROM WAL-MART
I'LL SAY "RESPECTABLE CUSTOMER
RESPECTABLE WAL-MART CUSTOMER
"DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU CAN BUY
SUCH A CHEAP TOY FROM WAL-MART?
THAT'S BECAUSE WE WORKERS WORK
ALL DAY EVERY DAY AND NIGHT."
WE ADDED 125000 NEW JOBS
AROUND THIS WORLD
THIS PAST YEAR --
GOOD JOBS.
JOBS AND BENEFITS.
WE HAVE PROFIT SHARING.
RETIREMENT SAVINGS
ACCOUNTS FOR OUR ASSOCIATES.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO ME
JOBS THAT COME WITH OPPORTUNITY
FOR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT.
Man: 189000 YOUNG WOMEN
IN BANGLADESH
ARE SEWING GARMENTS
FOR WAL-MART.
THESE WORKERS ARE GETTING UP
AT 5:30 IN THE MORNING
THEY BRUSH THEIR TEETH
WITH THEIR FINGER
USING ASHES FROM THE FIRE
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD
A TOOTHBRUSH.
FORCED TO WORK FROM 8:00 IN
THE MORNING UNTIL 10:00 AT NIGHT
14 HOURS A DAY 7 DAYS A WEEK
ON THESE WAGES
OF 13 TO 17 CENTS AN HOUR.
THESE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE HIT
BY THEIR SUPERVISORS
TRAPPED IN UTTER MISERY.
AS THE LARGEST COMPANY
IN THE WORLD
WAL-MART SETS THE STANDARDS
THAT OTHER COMPANIES
ARE GOING TO FOLLOW.
SO WAL-MART RIGHT NOW
IS SUCKING DOWN STANDARDS
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD.
THESE ARE WORKERS
WHO HAVE NO RIGHTS.
THE OUTLOOK FOR THIS COMPANY
TODAY IS VERY POSITIVE.
IN EVERY COUNTRY
THAT WE OPERATE IN
THE WAL-MART MODEL WORKS.
BECAUSE ONCE YOUR ASSOCIATES
KNOW
THAT YOU WILL STAND UP
FOR WHAT IS RIGHT
THEN WHEN THEY SEE
A WRONG OCCUR
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY
TO CONTACT YOU.
AND WE HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE
PROGRAM UNDER WAY
TO MAKE SURE AND HAVE HAD NOW
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
Lynn: I WAS A GLOBAL SERVICES
MANAGER FOR MEXICO
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.
MY JOB FUNCTION ENTITLED
THREE THINGS --
OVERSIGHT OF ALL FACTORY
CERTIFICATIONS
WHICH MEANS YOU GO IN THERE
AND YOU MAKE SURE
THAT THERE ARE
HUMANE WORKING CONDITIONS.
BIG DEAL WITH THE FACTORY
CERTIFICATIONS IS TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE WORKERS ARE IN A CLEAN
SAFE HUMANE ENVIRONMENT.
WHEN I WAS IN A FACTORY YOU
KNOW YOU TALK TO THE PEOPLE
AND THE PEOPLE ARE SO NICE.
AND THEY WERE SO GOOD
AND THEY WERE
JUST WORKING FOR SO LITTLE MONEY
AND WITHOUT ANY CONDITION
OF FAIRNESS WHATSOEVER
WITH THEIR COMPENSATION
AND THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS.
I WENT BACK TO MY HOTEL ROOM
AND JUST WEPT THE FIRST TIME.
YOU KNOW AFTER DINNER
I HAD PICKED UP THE PHONE.
I WAS CALLING MY WIFE
AND JUST TELLING HER
WHAT I'D SEEN
AND I STARTED CRYING ABOUT THAT.
TELLING HER... SHE WAS LIKE
"IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT."
AND I WAS LIKE "I KNOW.
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING."
I JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE
IT WAS THIS WAY.
I THOUGHT
THAT A COMPANY LIKE WAL-MART
ONCE WE STARTED REPORTING
THE TRUTH
OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING
AT THE FACTORY
THAT IT WOULD TAKE QUICK ACTION
TO TRY AND MAKE
THE WORKING CONDITIONS BETTER.
I BELIEVED IN THE MISSION
AND THE CULTURE
WHICH I THOUGHT EXISTED
AT WAL-MART.
I LED MORE WAL-MART CHEERS THAN
JUST ABOUT ANYBODY THAT I KNOW.
I DIDN'T EVEN MIND BEING
THE SQUIGGLY.
I MEAN
IF YOU WOULD HAVE CUT ME
I WOULD HAVE BLED
WAL-MART-BLUE BLOOD.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE WEREN'T
GONNA MAKE IT THE GOAL
TO CORRECT THE VIOLATIONS.
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT ANY RETALIATION
WOULD BE BROUGHT AGAINST ME
FOR DOING MY JOB.
I NOW REALIZE
I WAS PRETTY NAIVE.
BUT IT JUST DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME
THAT WAL-MART WOULD DO ANYTHING
EXCEPT FOR THE RIGHT THING
ONCE THEY WERE FACED
WITH THE TRUTH.
I KEPT GOING
INTO OTHER FACTORIES
AND SEEING THE SAME THINGS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
AND IT BECAME APPARENT TO ME
THAT THIS WAS NOT
AN ISOLATED ISSUE.
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS FOLLOW THE MONEY
AND THE ONES WHO ARE IN POWER
RIGHT NOW
HAVE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE
ON THEM TO PERFORM
LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED
TO KEEP THE GOODS FLOWING
TO THE UNITED STATES.
WHEN PUSH CAME TO SHOVE
THEY DID NOT STAND UP
AND DO THE RIGHT THING.
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
WAS WE WERE GETTING FIRED
FOR TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT
THE FACTORY CERTIFICATIONS.
AND THAT WAS SHOCKING.
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.
IT RIPPED MY HEART OUT.
TO HAVE ALL OF THAT RIPPED
FROM YOU
AND THEN TO GET SOLD OUT
AND LIED TO...
WAL-MART LET ME DOWN
AND WHEN I NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO LOOK OUT FOR ME
EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRYING TO LOOK
OUT FOR WAL-MART FOR YEARS.
Williams:
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT OUR SUPPLIERS COMPLY
WITH LOCAL COUNTRY CODES
WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS --
THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT UNDERAGE
THAT THEY'RE PAID WELL.
MADE IN THE U.S.A. --
IT MEANS SOMETHING.
"MADE IN THE U.S.A." MEANS
A JOB FOR SOMEBODY.
Announcer:
BUT WE'VE MADE IT OUR POLICY
TO FIND MORE U.S. SUPPLIERS
WHO CAN COMPETE
BECAUSE AMERICAN GOODS
MEAN AMERICAN JOBS.
AT WAL-MART WE PLEDGE TO
SUPPORT AMERICA'S SOURCES
WHENEVER WE CAN
SO YOU CAN TOO.
IF WE KEEP OUR PRICES LOW
AND RAISE OUR AVERAGE WAGE
SUBSTANTIALLY
WE WOULD IN FACT
DECREASE OUR PROFITABILITY
DISPROPORTIONATELY.
AND WE WOULD SACRIFICE
A HEALTHY CHUNK
OF WHAT IT IS THAT OUR
SHAREHOLDERS EXPECT FROM US.
Rev. Lawson: IT IS WRITTEN
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
"THE LOVE OF MONEY
IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL."
THIS DOES NOT SAY
THAT MONEY ITSELF IS EVIL.
THE FACT THAT I SHARED A ROOM
WITH TOM SCHOEWE OUR C.F.O.
WHILE WE WERE IN NEW YORK
SAVED $200.
THE FACT THAT MY DINNER
WAS $10 LAST NIGHT SAVED MONEY.
Rabbi Jacobs:
YOU SHALL NOT STEAL.
DOESN'T THIS TEACH US THAT
KEEPING EVERYTHING FOR OURSELVES
IS A FORM OF STEALING
OR ARE WE COMMANDED
TO HELP THOSE LESS FORTUNATE
TO FIND ENOUGH TO EAT?
TODAY I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOWEVER
THAT FIVE MEMBERS
OF THAT FAMILY
TOGETHER ARE WORTH
$102 BILLION.
THE WIDOW AND FOUR CHILDREN
HAVE IN THE LAST 20 YEARS
EMERGED ON THE LIST
OF THE TOP TEN WEALTHIEST PEOPLE
IN THE UNITED STATES.
THEY COULD EASILY TAKE
TEN BILLION OF THAT
AND SEE TO IT THAT EVERY
EMPLOYEE OF WAL-MART
IN THE UNITED STATES
HAS HEALTH CARE ADEQUATE
PENSION AND ADEQUATE WAGES.
WAL-MART AFTER THE 9-11 ATTACKS
ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
AND PENTAGON
THEY APPARENTLY DECIDED THAT
THEY NEEDED TO HAVE A BUNKER.
THERE'S A FACILITY
FOR THE WALTON FAMILY
IN CASE OF
AN APOCALYPTIC ATTACK --
A RESIDENCE
THAT THEY CAN LIVE IN
IN CASE THEY HAD TO DO THAT.
THERE'S A HELIPAD BEHIND
THE FACILITY BACK THERE
WHERE THEY CAN COME IN
BY HELICOPTER
AND THERE ARE SATELLITE UPLINK
DISHES BEHIND THE FACILITY.
MOST OF IT IS UNDERGROUND
AS YOU CAN SEE.
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE MUCH
FROM THE GATE
WHICH IS ALL FORTIFIED.
FAITH MEANS NOTHING AT ALL
IF IT DOES NOT INVOLVE US
LOVING ONE ANOTHER AS NEIGHBORS
IN COMPASSION FOR THE POOR...
Woman: WHEN YOU HEAR THESE BELLS
AT WAL-MART
DO YOU REMEMBER THE PEOPLE
THEY'RE RINGING FOR?
THEY REMIND US OF OUR FRIENDS
AND NEIGHBORS
WHO COULD USE A LITTLE HELP.
THAT'S WHY AT WAL-MART
WE GIVE BACK...
...THROUGHOUT THE HOLIDAYS
AND ALL YEAR LONG.
OF COURSE THE MOST IMPORTANT
BENEFICIARY OF THIS STORE
IS OUR CUSTOMER.
IT'S A CUSTOMER WHO LIVES
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.
I WAS ACTUALLY SELLING CARS
FOR SIX MONTHS
BUT PRIOR TO THAT
I ACTUALLY HAD MY OWN BUSINESS.
I WAS DOING WOOD REFINISHING
ON BOATS.
AND I ACTUALLY DID QUITE WELL
AT THAT.
GETTING A LITTLE OLD FOR THAT.
IF I WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH
ALL THAT I WENT THROUGH
I WANTED SOMETHING TO COME OUT
OF IT -- SOMETHING GOOD.
THERE WAS A TRUCK TO ONE SIDE.
THERE WAS A VAN TO ONE SIDE.
I THOUGHT "YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE SPOT
WHERE NOBODY CAN SEE YOU."
BUT I THOUGHT "FOUR CAR SPACES
FROM THE FRONT DOOR."
I THOUGHT THEY HAD
SECURITY OUTSIDE.
I THOUGHT "I SHOULD BE FINE."
WHEN I GOT OUT
THERE WAS TWO OF THEM.
UNFORTUNATELY HE CAUGHT ME.
I GOT OUTSIDE BUT HE CAUGHT ME.
AND THAT'S WHEN
I REALIZED HE HAD A GUN.
HE HAD A GUN IN THE ARM
THAT WAS HOLDING ME.
THAT'S WHEN THEY TOLD ME
"GET IN THE CAR
OR I'M GONNA BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF."
THE YEAR BEFORE WHEN I WORKED
AT THE PHONE COMPANY
WE HAD A SAFETY MEETING.
IT WAS AROUND CHRISTMASTIME
AND THEY HAD THE SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT THERE.
AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT
IF YOU'RE IN A PARKING LOT
AND THIS HAPPENS
WHAT TO DO --
DON'T GO WITH THEM.
IF YOU GO WITH THEM
YOU'RE LIKELY NOT GOING TO LIVE
BECAUSE I GUESS STATISTICALLY
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
THEY'LL KILL YOU.
THAT'S WHAT FIRST WENT
THROUGH MY MIND
IS THAT "I'M NOT GOING
TO SURVIVE THIS."
SORRY.
SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW
THE DECISION TO JUMP OUT
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
"I WANT TO CHOOSE."
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING
TO RAPE ME TOO.
WHEN HE SAID HE DIDN'T
WANT THE CAR
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO
RAPE ME.
SO WHEN THEY GOT ME
BACK IN THE CAR
AND AFTER LOOKING AT THE GUN
I JUST KIND OF RESIGNED TO
YOU KNOW...
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.
AND YOU GO KIND OF COLD INSIDE.
THIS IS THE PARKING LOT
WHERE LAURA TANAKA FACED
HER ATTACKERS.
INSIDE THE STORE
WAL-MART HAD MORE THAN
200 SECURITY CAMERAS
AND FOUR SECURITY GUARDS
ON PATROL.
OUTSIDE THERE WAS NOTHING.
THE POLICE DID RECOMMEND
ON-SITE SECURITY.
THERE WAS NONE.
THEY HAD ASSURED THE PEOPLE
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE
ARMED SECURITY
AND MAKE SURE IT WAS SAFE
FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THAT WASN'T DONE.
IT WAS EVIDENT
THAT WAL-MART KNEW
THEY HAD SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS
IN THEIR PARKING LOTS.
WAL-MART WAS AWARE
THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE CRIME
THROUGHOUT THE STATES
OCCURRED IN THEIR PARKING LOTS.
DESPITE THE FACT
THAT 80% OF THE CRIME
OCCURRED IN THEIR PARKING LOTS
THEY HAD DONE ALMOST NOTHING
TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMERS
IN THE LOTS.
RAPE MURDER KIDNAPPING --
ALL OF THESE
SHOCKING ALLEGATIONS
AND THEY COME
FROM WAL-MART SHOPPERS.
Woman: REPORT OF A WAL-MART
PARKING-LOT ATTACK.
TONIGHT NORTH TEXAS POLICE
ARE ON THE HUNT
FOR A WOULD-BE KIDNAPPER.
A VIOLENT ATTACK
IN THE PARKING LOT
OF AN ORANGE COUNTY WAL-MART.
AT LEAST ONE MAN TRIED TO
CARJACK ROB AND SHOOT A WOMAN.
Man: ...WHO SHOT AND KILLED
33-YEAR-OLD MARK KORENEK
IN THE STORE'S PARKING LOT.
A BOLD AND DEADLY SHOOTING.
IT HAPPENED THIS MORNING
AT THE WAL-MART...
A TAYLOR WOMAN IS RECOVERING
TONIGHT AFTER FIGHTING A THIEF
IN A WAL-MART PARKING LOT.
Woman: A MAN IS ARRESTED
AFTER A TIRE-IRON ATTACK.
IT HAPPENED IN THE PARKING LOT
OF THIS WAL-MART.
Woman #2:
THE TWO TEENAGE WORKERS
SHOT WHILE GATHERING CARTS
IN THE PARKING LOT YESTERDAY
AT THIS GLENDALE WAL-MART.
Woman #3:
IT HAPPENED AT 1:48 THIS MORNING
IN THE WAL-MART PARKING LOT
IN RIVERDALE.
SHE TURNED TO RUN
FROM THE SUBJECT
AND WAS SHOT IN THE BACK.
Woman:
WAL-MART HAS CONDUCTED RESEARCH
ON CRIME IN ITS PARKING LOTS
AND CRITICS ACCUSE THE COMPANY
OF A NATIONWIDE PATTERN
OF COVERING UP THAT RESEARCH
OF FAILING TO TURN IT OVER
IN LAWSUITS.
HERE'S WHAT WAL-MART
DID NOT WANT TO SHOW.
AS EARLY AS 1994
AS YOU CAN SEE
IN THIS INTERNAL DOCUMENT
A WAL-MART STUDY SHOWED THAT 80%
OF CRIME AT WAL-MART LOCATIONS
OCCURRED IN THE PARKING LOT.
AND WHEN THE COMPANY ADDED
ROVING PATROLS AT SEVERAL SITES
THE CRIME RATE DROPPED
TO AS LOW AS ZERO.
A DISTRICT JUDGE
IN BEAUMONT TONIGHT
IS FINING WAL-MART STORES
$18 MILLION.
JUDGE JAMES MAHATHY
IS SANCTIONING WAL-MART
FOR WHAT THE COURT BELIEVES
WAS A PATTERN OF DECEPTION.
IT INVOLVES THE CASE
OF A SOUTHEAST TEXAS WOMAN
WHO WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
AND RAPED
IN THE PARKING LOT
OF WAL-MART.
THE COURT FOUND THAT WAL-MART
DID NOT DISCLOSE
THAT IT HAD CONDUCTED
A SAFETY STUDY --
A STUDY THAT FOUND
IF WAL-MART
WOULD PUT EMPLOYEES
IN GOLF CARTS
PATROLLING ITS PARKING LOTS
CRIME THERE WOULD DROP
TO ZERO.
Stahl: JUDGE SHERILYN WOOD HEARD
A CASE
AGAINST WAL-MART
IN HOUSTON TEXAS IN 1999
INVOLVING AN ASSAULT
IN A WAL-MART PARKING LOT.
SHE SAYS THAT IN 17 YEARS ON
THE BENCH AND OVER 25000 CASES
SHE'S RARELY SEEN SUCH
FLAGRANT ABUSE OF THE SYSTEM.
IT WAS VERY DISTURBING TO SEE
SUCH AN INTENTIONAL COURSE
OF CONDUCT. IT WAS CORRUPT.
Stahl: SHE'S CHARGING WAL-MART
WITH CHEATING IN COURT.
AND SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.
THIS IS ONE JUDGE --
"IS THERE SOMETHING IN
THE DRINKING WATER IN ARKANSAS
THAT SAYS PERJURY
IS ALL RIGHT?"
ANOTHER JUDGE --
"RARELY HAS THIS COURT SEEN
SUCH A PATTERN
"OF DELIBERATE OBFUSCATION
DELAY MISREPRESENTATION
AND DOWNRIGHT LYING."
TRUE.
Fortune:
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE CUSTOMER
THEY REALLY DON'T CARE
WHAT GOES ON
AFTER YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY
IN THERE
AND COME OUT INTO
THE PARKING LOT TO GO HOME.
Man: POLICE FOUND HOLDEN
SHOT TO DEATH
ALONG THE SIDE OF A ROAD
IN STANTON TEXAS --
400 MILES
FROM WHERE SHE WAS ABDUCTED.
Kirkpatrick:
MEGAN WAS VERY SPECIAL.
WE GREW UP TOGETHER.
WE LIVED TOGETHER.
SHE'S REALLY REALLY GONNA
BE MISSED A WHOLE LOT
BECAUSE SHE HAS A LOT
OF PEOPLE THAT LOVE HER.
SHE WAS JUST
A VERY SWEET PERSON AND...
SHE NEVER WANTED
A WHOLE LOT OUT OF LIFE.
BUT SHE JUST WANTED TO LIVE
AND YOU KNOW BE HAPPY.
THAT'S ALL SHE WANTED.
JUST RECENTLY BEFORE SHE DIED
WE WERE IN HER ROOM
LISTENING TO A CD.
WE WERE SINGING TOGETHER.
AND WE COULD JUST BE OPEN
WITH EACH OTHER.
WE DIDN'T CARE.
Man: POLICE SAY MEGAN HOLDEN
WAS CHOSEN AT RANDOM
ON THE WAY TO HER PICKUP TRUCK
IN THE WAL-MART PARKING LOT
JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
AFTER THAT CRIME WAS CAUGHT
ON SURVEILLANCE VIDEO
POLICE SAY WILLIAMS
A MARINE VETERAN
WITH A HISTORY OF DRUG OFFENSES
SPED OFF IN HOLDEN'S TRUCK
HEADING WEST
WHERE HE APPARENTLY MURDERED
THE 19-YEAR-OLD
JUNIOR-COLLEGE STUDENT
AND DUMPED HER BODY
NEAR SOME RAILROAD TRACKS
IN THE WEST TEXAS TOWN
OF STANTON.
I JUST THINK
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
WAL-MART COULD HAVE DONE.
THERE SHOULD BE SOMEBODY
WATCHING THE CAMERAS.
SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WATCHING THE CAMERAS.
WAL-MART HAS THOSE CAMERAS
OUT THERE IN THEIR PARKING LOT
AND I THOUGHT
THAT THEY WERE WATCHING.
Man: A SECURITY CAMERA
WITHOUT SOMEONE WATCHING IT
IS OF NO USE AT ALL.
THE ABDUCTION AND MURDER
THAT HAPPENED IN TEXAS
HAPPENED AT A STORE
WHERE THE LOSS-PREVENTION TEAM
WAS SENT IN TO SET UP
A SECURITY SYSTEM OUTSIDE
THAT WOULD TRACK THE UNION
ACTIVITY IN THAT STORE.
AND THE ONLY REASONS THAT THEY
HAD THE PICTURES THAT THEY DID
WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD
THE UNION PACKAGE
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE STORE.
WAL-MART FOCUSES ON PROTECTING
THEIR PROPERTY
AND NOT THEIR PATRONS.
A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR COMPANY...
COULDN'T YOU PAY SOMEONE LIKE
$12 AN HOUR TO WATCH A CAMERA?
IF PEOPLE ARE PUTTING PROFITS
BEFORE SAFETY
THEY'RE PUTTING PROFITS
BEFORE HUMAN LIFE
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU CAN SAY TO THEM.
Woman: A MAN IS SUING A WAL-MART
IN NEWCASTLE
SAYING HIS MOTHER DIED
AFTER A BOTCHED ROBBERY ATTEMPT
IN THE STORE'S PARKING LOT.
Man: THE RANDOM SHOOTING
HAPPENED HERE.
THAT THREE PEOPLE ARE DEAD
AND THREE OTHERS INJURED...
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED IN THE
MIDDLE OF A BUSY SHOPPING DAY.
AT LEAST ONE MAN TRIED TO
CARJACK ROB AND SHOOT A WOMAN.
REPORT OF A WAL-MART
PARKING LOT ATTACK...
TONIGHT NORTH TEXAS POLICE
ARE ON THE HUNT
FOR A WOULD-BE KIDNAPPER.
A BOLD AND DEADLY SHOOTING...
A SHOOTING RAMPAGE...
RANDOM SHOOTING...
A BOLD AND DEADLY SHOOTING.
IT JUST HAPPENED THIS MORNING.
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED...
TONIGHT NORTH TEXAS POLICE
ARE ON THE HUNT
FOR A WOULD-BE KIDNAPPER.
A WAL-MART STORE
HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SOCIETY
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE DO
FITS IN AND REPRESENTS
WHAT IT IS SOCIETY EXPECTS
FROM A BIG COMPANY.
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE
IN FACT WORK TOGETHER
TO CAUSE THEM TO WANT
TO HAVE A WAL-MART.
Laney: ON DECEMBER 6th
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ON THE
FRONT PAGE OF OUR LOCAL PAPER
AND IT SAID THAT WAL-MART
WAS GOING TO BUILD A SUPERCENTER
ON THE CORNER OF QUEEN CREEK
AND ALMOND SCHOOL
WHICH IS JUST A VERY SHORT
DISTANCE FROM MY HOUSE.
AND THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION
WAS WITHIN
OUR PLANNED COMMUNITY
AND IT WAS WITHIN WALKING
DISTANCE OF AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
AND A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.
AND I FELT THAT IT WAS
AN INAPPROPRIATE LOCATION
FOR SOMETHING OF THAT MAGNITUDE.
SO I DECIDED TO FORM A CAMPAIGN
AND SAY "NO WAL-MART
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD."
Rev. Perez: LIVING AS CHRIST
HAS TAUGHT US
WE BEGIN TO TRANSFORM
THE WORLD.
THIS TRANSFORMATION IS VISIBLE
IN THE READING
THAT WE HAVE FROM ACTS.
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO SHOW
WHY THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING
IS THE WORK OF THE GOSPEL.
THE LESSON WE LEARNED
IN INGLEWOOD
IS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY
THROUGH OUR DEMOCRACY
TO TAKE POWER AND TAKE CONTROL
AND ACTUALLY HOLD BIG COMPANIES
ACCOUNTABLE.
AS A NATION IN THIS WORLD
THE MOST POWERFUL
THE MOST AFFLUENT
WE HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE SURE
THAT ALL HAVE WHAT THEY NEED
THAT THIS IS NOT SOME
PIE-IN-THE-SKY VISION
BUT INSTEAD THAT THIS IS
OUR CALL AS CHRISTIANS
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
Laney:
ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS AND I WENT
AND HAND-MADE
SOME LITTLE POSTERS
AND WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE
GOING TO HAVE A MEETING
IN THE LOCAL PARK
WHICH WAS ABOUT A BLOCK
FROM HERE.
WE HAD NO IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE
WOULD SHOW UP.
WE WERE ABSOLUTELY AMAZED
AND ALL OF THEM
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING.
Rev. Perez: IN THE BEGINNING
IT WAS ONLY A FEW OF US.
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME
TO THE MEETINGS
ONLY SOME SUPERMARKET WORKERS
AND A COUPLE OF CHURCHES.
AND THEN MORE PEOPLE UNTIL THEY
STARTED FEELING THE PRESSURE.
THEY WANTED TO BUILD THE
WAL-MART ON THIS WHOLE PARCEL.
IT WAS GOING TO BE
215000 SQUARE FEET.
AND THERE WAS GOING TO BE...
WAL-MART WAS GOING TO TAKE
THIS WHOLE SPACE.
IT'S LIKE 17 FOOTBALL FIELDS
BIG.
AND THEY WERE GOING TO BUILD
ONE BIG BOX THAT WAS WAL-MART
AND THEN LITTLE STORES
IN BETWEEN
AND ANOTHER BIG BOX
THAT WAS SAM'S CLUB.
Laney: PEOPLE VOLUNTEERED TO DO
THE VARIOUS CHORES THAT WE HAD
AND THEN WE SOLICITED
WHAT I CALL A CORE COMMITTEE
AND THAT WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE
WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE STRATEGY
THE PRESS RELEASES
EVERYTHING THAT NEEDED TO BE
DONE TO ORGANIZE OUR CAMPAIGN.
Rev. Perez: THEN THE COALITION
STARTED GETTING BIGGER
AND BEFORE YOU KNEW IT
EVERYBODY FELT LIKE
IF THEY WEREN'T PART OF A
COALITION FOR A BETTER INGLEWOOD
THEY WEREN'T STANDING UP
TO DEFEND THE COMMUNITY.
Aparicio: THE OTHER LESSON
LEARNED IN INGLEWOOD
IS THAT THERE'S NO KIND OF
MAGIC POTION TO SUDDENLY...
YOU CLICK THIS
YOU PUT THIS TOGETHER
AND SUDDENLY
YOU'RE GOING TO WIN.
IT'S A HARD PROCESS.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT HAVE TO COME IN PLACE.
BUT WHEN YOU PUT THOSE THINGS
IN PLACE YOU CAN WIN.
IT INCLUDES THE ABILITY
TO ORGANIZE REGULAR PEOPLE
SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS
WORKERS...
WE GOT OUR MESSAGE FOCUSED.
WE HAMMERED AWAY ON THE PHONES
HAMMERED AWAY ON DOORS.
PEOPLE SAW US COMING AND GOING
WHEN THEY WENT TO CHURCH
AND EVERY TIME THEY WENT
TO A STORE IN INGLEWOOD
THERE WAS A FLYER
ABOUT OUR EFFORT.
WE HELD RALLIES.
IT WAS LEGAL STRATEGY.
ENOUGH RESOURCES
TO HAVE THE RESEARCH
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE YOUR CASE
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE
THE MATERIALS.
IT INCLUDES THE ABILITY TO GET
OUT YOUR MESSAGE TO THE PRESS
TO DO MEDIA EVENTS.
Laney:
WE GREW TO 187 VOLUNTEERS
AND WE HAD BLOCK CAPTAINS
AND WE HAD AREA CHAIRMEN.
WE PROCEEDED TO GATHER
SIGNATURES ON OUR PETITIONS
AND WE STARTED OUT
WITH 1500 SIGNATURES.
AND BY THE TIME WE GOT THROUGH
WE HAD 4000 SIGNATURES.
AND THEY WERE ALL FROM PEOPLE
WITHIN OUR
WHAT I CALL OUR AREA CODE --
OUR ZIP CODE.
ZIP CODE.
I ALWAYS GET THE TWO MIXED UP --
ZIP CODE.
Man:
INGLEWOOD IS THE FIRST TEST
FOR WAL-MART'S AMBITIOUS
PLANS IN CALIFORNIA
AND ACTIVISTS SAY THE STAKES
HERE ARE HUGE.
THIS IS LIKE
"GODZILLA EATS TOKYO."
THIS IS MUCH BIGGER
THAN DAVID AND GOLIATH.
ALL OF THE INFORMATION COMING
FROM WAL-MART
KEPT SAYING
"IT'S A DONE DEAL.
"THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.
"WE HAVE OUR ZONING.
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
BUT WE KNEW BETTER.
THEN WE HAD NUMEROUS PUBLIC
MEETINGS TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
WHAT THE STATUS WAS.
IT IS NOT LIKE THEY CAME INTO
THE SMALL TOWNS IN THE SOUTH
OR TOWNS THAT HAVE NO BUSINESS
AND THEY BROUGHT IN BUSINESS.
NO. THIS IS SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
THEY REPRESENT
FROM BENTONVILLE ARKANSAS
PLANTATION CAPITALISM.
THE FUTURE OF THIS COMMUNITY
DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY
TO STOP THE MONSTER
IN ITS TRACKS.
Man: WAL-MART SPONSORED
THE BALLOT INITIATIVE
AFTER INGLEWOOD'S CITY COUNCIL
OPPOSED BUILDING A WAL-MART
SUPERCENTER ON THE SITE.
TODAY WAL-MART OPPONENTS
CHARGED THE INITIATIVE MEASURE 4A
HIJACKS THE CITY'S
PLANNING PROCESS.
IT IS 71 PAGES
OF LEGAL FINE PRINT
THAT SEEKS TO CUT THE COMMUNITY
OUT OF ITS OWN
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
Hutchinson:
WHAT THEY DID WAS ESSENTIALLY
TELL THE CITY OF INGLEWOOD
"GET OUT OF HERE.
"WE ARE THE BIGGEST CORPORATION
IN THE WORLD.
WE CAN GO IN AND ESSENTIALLY BUY
AN ELECTION."
Laney: WE HELD PUBLIC MEETINGS.
WE DID OUR LETTERS.
WE HELD PRIVATE MEETINGS
WITH CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.
WE WERE OUT ON THE STREET
AND DOING THE WORK
TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD
THAT TO THOSE WHO MUCH HAS BEEN
GIVEN MUCH WILL BE EXPECTED.
I'M SURE THE WALTON FAMILY
BELIEVES
THAT THEY'RE A GOOD
CHRISTIAN FAMILY.
BUT I THINK
THEY HAVE MADE MILLIONS
AT THE EXPENSE OF POOR WORKERS.
AND I'M SURE
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT THINK THAT THEY'RE GOOD
CHRISTIAN COMPANIES.
NOT IF THEY'RE GOING
TO MAKE MONEY
OFF THE BACKS OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE SUFFERING.
Laney:
A LOT OF PEOPLE SACRIFICED
AN AWFUL LOT TO HAVE ALL
THE FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE.
AND THAT FLAG TO ME
REPRESENTS ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS.
OUR FREEDOM TO FIGHT WAL-MART.
OUR FREEDOM TO LIVE
WHERE WE WANT TO
WORK WHERE WE WANT TO...
...HAVE A SAY IN OUR GOVERNMENT.
THEY CAN SAY AND BELIEVE
WHATEVER THEY WANT ABOUT
YOU KNOW TRICKLE-DOWN THEORIES
OF CAPITAL
AND WHATEVER OTHER NONSENSE
THEY WANT TO INVENT
TO HOLD ON TO THEIR CAPITAL.
BUT AS CHRISTIANS
WE DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION.
THAT'S NOT OUR OPTION.
THAT WE'RE NOT ABOUT CAPITAL
THAT WE'RE ABOUT PEOPLE.
Laney: WE CAME BEFORE THE CITY
COUNCIL FOR THE FINAL VOTE
AND THE COUNCIL VOTED 6-0
TO DENY WAL-MART
AND BEST STAR THE DEVELOPER
THE RIGHT TO BUILD THE STORE
ON THAT PROPERTY.
Man: RESIDENTS OF INGLEWOOD
CALIFORNIA ARE VOTING TODAY
ON WHETHER TO APPROVE

Rev. Perez: WE GATHERED
AT A LOCAL RESTAURANT
HOPING FOR A MIRACLE
BUT BRACED TO GO BACK TO COURT
IF THE MEASURE PASSED.
Woman:

ON A PROPOSED WAL-MART
SUPER STORE IN INGLEWOOD.

Woman: THIS SMALL GROUP OF
PEOPLE TOOK ON A GIANT AND WON.
AND IT WAS REALLY MEANINGFUL
BECAUSE NOBODY THOUGHT
WE COULD WIN THIS.
WE DIDN'T THINK WE COULD WIN.

Man: ONE MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR
VISIT WASHINGTON'S ADULT HOME
IN MOUNT VERNON.
ON THIS PRESIDENT'S DAY
THERE WAS DISBELIEF THAT ANYONE
WOULD DREAM OF DISTURBING
HIS BOYHOOD HOME.
BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF PLACES
FOR A SHOPPING CENTER
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE
WASHINGTON FARM.
Man: SURVEYORS HAVE ALREADY
MARKED OFF THE PROPERTY LINE
FOR THE WAL-MART.
Woman: NO. THAT'S HISTORY.
THEY SHOULDN'T DESTROY
PEOPLE'S HISTORY LIKE THAT.
Woman: MAY 29th
A HAWAIIAN GROUP SUED

WHAT IF IT WAS THEIR GREAT-
GRANDFATHER THAT WAS DESECRATED?
FOR NOW THE REMAINS ARE BEING
STORED IN A TRAILER BELOW A RAMP
LEADING TO A PARKING GARAGE
AT WAL-MART.
Man: WE PUT A SIGN UP IN THE
WORTHINGTON MINNESOTA STORE
THAT WAS 10 FEET
OVER THE CITY CODE THERE.
AND THE BUILDING INSPECTOR
RED-TAGGED IT.
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW
THERE'S AN OVERNIGHT --
THEY CALL ME AND TELL ME
THERE'S AN OVERNIGHT PACKAGE
COMING FOR ME
AND I'M TO TAKE IT
TO THIS PERSON.
THE ENVELOPE WASN'T SEALED.
AND SO I JUST OPENED IT UP
AND THERE'S A $10000 CHECK.
AND I GAVE IT TO THE INDIVIDUAL
AND THE VERY NEXT DAY
THE RED TAG'S OFF THE SIGN.
WHEN YOU HAVE A GROUP
OF PEOPLE
A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE
WHO DON'T WANT YOU
IN A COMMUNITY
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO THERE?
