This picture,
truly one of the most
unusual ever filmed,
contains scenes which
under no circumstances
should be viewed by anyone
with a heart condition
or anyone who is easily upset.
We urgently recommend
that if you are such a person
or the parent
of a young or impressionable child
now in attendance,
that you and the child
leave the auditorium.

Narrator: Rome was the largest
and the most beautiful city
of the ancient world.
The magnificent facade
of the empire, however,
could not conceal
the seeds of decay,
the unhealthy dependence
of the economy on slaves,
the disparity between
rich and poor.
Behind the splendor
of the Forum
were vast areas
of crowded slums.
Escape from the slums was difficult
for there were few jobs available
and practically none
for the unskilled.
To keep idle citizens entertained
and out of mischief,
frequent games and spectacles
were held at public expense.
At first, only chariot races
were sponsored.
But by the reign of Trajan,
brutal combat to the death
had become popular.
Earlier in Rome's history,
elected representatives
exercised the power.
But by now,
every function of government
had been absorbed
by the emperor
who was above the law
and ruled by decree.
That a people as civilized
as the Romans,
with the most humane
system of law ever devised,
could tolerate the violation
of human beings
is astonishing.
This imbalance
and the irresponsible behavior
of public officials
would become major reasons
for Rome's eventual decline.
Michael Moore: l wonder how
future civilizations will view our society.
Will they judge us by this?
- ( mews )
"" He's a cat flushin' a toilet,
he's a cat flushin' a toilet ""
"" He's a cat flushin' a toilet. ""
( mews )
Moore: Or will they
judge us by this?
Man #1 :
Do you see the sheriff's car?
Man #2: Yeah, right there.
The sheriff-- that's the first car.
- Woman: No--
- There he is.
Man #3:
Three, four, five, six...
Woman: Seven.
- Man #1 : Give me the phone.
- Woman: lt's on this--
it's on the c--
it's on the couch.
All right, that's as close
as l can get, Dad.
- Don't stand in front of the door, Dad.
- ( knocking )
( whispering )
Get out from the--
Hey, Sheriff, Robert
inside the house here.
- ( knocking )
- ( loud banging )
Woman: They're trying to beat
the back door in, Dad.
( loud banging )
There are four of us in here.
They're beating on the door.
We're not gonna resist,
but you will have to come
in the house on your own.
But there are four souls
in this house.
Woman: Dad, don't stand
in front of the door.
- Do not.
- ( doorknob rattling )
( banging continues )
Woman:
Another witness.
Tell your name to the camera.
- l'm David Phillips.
- Chris Collins.
And Audra Collins.
( banging continues )
- David: And this is America?
- Chris: Uh-huh.
Audra: This is America, folks,
what you're watching right here.
- Sheriff's office.
- Robert: Yeah, we know.
- Okay, y'all have to come out, please.
- Robert: All right.
Woman: We cannot act like this--
this is just something that's okay.
And so this is new.
They've never come out
and boarded up our house
after they've evicted the person
and threw their furniture
in the dumpster.
So they're letting us know
that they are stepping it up,
boarding up somebody's house.
This has been my family home.
This is my parents' house.
l've lived here for 41 years.
This is the only home
l've ever really lived in.
This is the only-- this will always
be home to me, no matter what.
- l'm a carpenter.
- Woman: There you go.
Man #1 : Sandra, they're leaving.
Let them leave.
- Man #2: l'm a carpenter. So what?
- That's all l am.
- Well, people pay their bills.
- This could happen to you.
Carpenter: That's right.
So why do you think l'm doing it?
l don't have to be happy about this,
but that's what l do.
Sandra: That's all l'm saying is that
maybe you can make another choice.
- That's all we're saying.
- That's no reason for...
Sandra:
You're a working-class person.
...people here to get upset
and almost get themselves hurt.
We ain't gonna get hurt.
Are you threatening us?
Y'all gonna get on out of here.
You might end up even getting hurt.
Talking about us getting hurt,
you might get hurt.
Man: There's gonna be
some kind of a rebellion
between the people
that have nothing
and the people that's got it all.
l don't understand.
There's no in-between no more.
There's the people that's got it all
and the people that have nothing.
We gotta get this stuff
out of the house and packed up
and be out of here
in about 30 days
even though we don't
have a place to go.
Oh.
Woman:
We designed this house.
The property that it's on
was my family farm.
So l've lost a piece
of my heritage with this.
Why do you do this
to the hard-working people?
Why do you take everything?
You take everything
away from them.
We're just middle-class,
hard-working people
trying to make a living.
Just trying to survive.
An old Browning.
( grunts )
My pistol,
my dad's pistol, my pistol.
( sighs )
- ( knocking )
- Man: Sheriff's department.
lt's supposed to be 30 days.
l got 30 days to get my stuff out.
- That's what the guy told me.
- No.
What?
lt's currently scheduled for today.
But...
The paper's telling us
that we are due
to do an eviction here
today at 9:00 AM.
Huh, shoot.
Well, he's surprised too.
The house is gone.
That cop told me that the house
has already been sold
to somebody else.
So we don't own the house no more,
somebody else does.
Moore:
This is capitalism,
a system of taking and giving--
mostly taking.
The only thing we didn't know
was when the revolt would begin.
Man: Everything,
we've tried everything...
except robbing a bank.
l'm thinking about
maybe doing that.
You know, that's one way
somebody could get their money back.
lf they did it--
they did it to me,
l don't know why
l can't do it to them.
Peter Zalewski:
This is my second Hyundai Sonata.
l'll probably get a new car next year.
And when l do,
it'll probably be another Sonata.
You know, l'm not a car guy.
lf l can go in there
and steal a condo
for the equivalent of what
a Mercedes would cost
or a Bentley would cost,
l'm all about that.
Moore:
Meet Peter Zalewski,
Florida's up-and-coming
real estate whiz.
Here we go.
Moore: He calls his
real estate company Condo Vultures.
( stuttering )
We have a very good sign.
You have the final notice
of eviction.
So you can see this person
was basically thrown out
by the police department.
Welcome.
Moore:
Peter deals exclusively
with clients who buy up
foreclosed homes
and then resell them at a profit.
lt's gonna be about
830 square feet or so...
At the end of the day,
the only people who are buying
are primarily individuals
that we represent...
Today it's on the market
for $66,000.
...which are basically bottom feeders
who are going in there.
They have no compassion,
no sensitivity.
They're running purely off numbers
They're coming in all cash,
and they're looking to slit
any single seller's throat
regardless of what
their situation is.
So people always ask,
''What's 25cents on the dollar?''
This is it.
This is what you're gonna get.
The vulture basically represents
a bottom feeder
that goes in there
and cleans off a carcass.
Because they're dealing with
so many different germs and situations,
they'll have to vomit on themselves
and there's some sort
of cleansing process that occurs.
The vultures
aren't actually killing,
they're the ones
doing the clean-up.
Which bank you want?
Bank of America?
What we do is we tap into data...
and boom, voila.
Here we got 3,400 foreclosing
by Bank of America.
Gotta love it.
As we collect data,
it's giving us
the insight into the battlefield,
almost like a drone that flies
over the battleground in Afghanistan
or in Pakistan or in lraq.
The current asking price is 355.
Again, it was purchased for 840.
A little bit of a discount.
You're gonna have two...
Our people are using
that data to be able to go in
and try to steal properties,
legally and ethically,
but take them at the bare-bone
bottom price.
lt's all about taking right now.
Look at the-- look at the roof--
completely gone and missing.
We haven't had a hurricane
in five years.
( laughing )
Welcome to the housing crash,
Miami style.
So this-- this is what capitalism is
and this is why the information
is so critical.
We go in there,
we alert them to it,
and if they like it, you know--
( imitates shotgun )
- Look at the window.
- Look at that.
Looks like the house
next door was on fire.
This is straight up capitalism.
- Fire damage.
- l wonder if somebody was living there...
Zalewski: Everybody's got
this desire to go in there
and take advantage
of others' misfortunes.
Somebody asked me,
''What's the difference between
you and a real vulture?''
l said, ''lt's very simple.
l don't vomit on myself.''
Our topic today:
What is capitalism?
Capitalism?
Well, why should there be
any question about it?
Hasn't it given us the highest
standard of living in the world?
We're free to try to make a profit,
to just get by, or to fail.
That's what capitalism is:
a system of free enterprise.
Now tell us what
''free enterprise'' means.
Moore: l went to see
my friend Wally Shawn,
a playwright
and sometimes actor.
lnconceivable!
Moore: But Wally also studied
history and politics
and even a little
elementary economics.
Free enterprise
is a form of words
that is intended
to conjure up in your mind
a little town with different shops.
And the guy who runs
the best shop
has the most customers.
Narrator: There is the basis
of the capitalistic system:
the profit motive.
He's in business to make money.
Shawn: The original
theory of capitalism
is that it's a very clever way
of society voting on what goods
it wants made.
What do you use this for?
That's-- l could use that
for practically everything l ever do.
You know, society votes.
They like the way this guy
makes ice cream.
But the other guy,
they don't like
his ice cream that much
and they don't buy it,
so it fades out.
lt's on me.
That is a good fit.
Shawn: The basic law of life
is that if you have things,
you can easily get more things.
Very quickly, one guy can have
five times more
than anybody else.
- Free enterprise.
- Competition.
Woman:
The profit motive.
Moore: My dad, an assembly-line
worker at General Motors,
bought and paid for our house
before l graduated
from kindergarten.
We had a new car
every three years.
We went to New York
every other summer.
That's me on Wall Street.
And that's me
directing my first movie
at the World's Fair.
We went to Catholic schools,
we lived a good life.
lf this was capitalism,
l loved it...
and so did everyone else.
During these years
a lot of people got rich
and they had to pay
a top tax rate of 90% .
90% ?
Yep.
But they still got to live
like Bogie and Bacall.
And what did we do
with all their money?
We built damns, bridges,
interstate highways,
schools, hospitals.
We even sent a guy to the moon.
Things seemed to be going
in the right direction.
Dad had a secure job
and Mom could work
if she wanted,
but didn't have to.
Middle-class families only needed
one income to survive.
Our union family had
free health care and free dental.
The kids could go to college
without getting a loan from a bank.
Dad had four weeks
paid vacation every summer.
Most people had
a savings account and little debt.
And Dad's pension was set aside
where no one could touch it.
lt would be there for him
when he retired.
We got all of this because
our main industrial competition
had been reduced to rubble.
Here's what the German
car industry looked like.
And here's the Japanese
auto industry.
l guess you could say
it's easy to be number one
when you have no competition.
Yes, of course
not everything was perfect.
We didn't mind having to put up
with a little bit of this
and a little bit of that...
just as long as we could be
middle-class.
And we could count on our kids
having it better than we had it.
lt sounded like
a good deal to us.
Capitalism-- no one
ever had it so good.
And then, right when
we were in the middle
of this big love affair
with capitalism...
Announcer: The ABC
Sunday Night Movie ''The Gambler''
will continue in its entirety
following this live report
from ABC News.
We are at a turning point
in our history.
Moore:
Along came Debbie Downer.
Too many of us now
tend to worship
self-indulgence
and consumption.
Human identity
is no longer defined
by what one does,
but by what one owns.
This is not a message
of happiness or reassurance,
but it is the truth
and it is a warning.
Moore:
Wow, what a bummer.
lt was time to bring
a new sheriff to town...
( horse whinnies )
...one who knew how to act
like a president.
He knew how to handle workers
who wanted a better wage.
( gunshot )
All right, mister, l guess you win.
Moore:
Or these annoying feminists
whining about their
Equal Rights Amendment.
Well, l can change that in a hurry.
Moore: A man who knew
how to get the job done.
Ronald Reagan
came out of the B movies
to become the most famous
corporate spokesman of the 1950s.
lt's a transistor radio too.
Weighs only a few ounces.
You can slip it
right into your pocket.
Boraxo waterless hand cleaner
really cleans up for us.
Moore:
He had found his calling
and Wall Street
had found their man.
You see, the banks and corporations
had a simple plan:
to remake America to serve them.
But to pull it off would require
electing a spokesmodel
for president.
And on November 4th, 1980,
that's what we did.
...that l will faithfully execute
the office of President
of the United States.
Crowd:
Ronald Ronald Ronald...
Thank you.
Moore:
lt was an historic moment
because now corporate America
and Wall Street
were in almost complete control.
See that guy standing
next to the president?
You know, the one
that looks like a butler?
His name was Don Regan,
the Chairman of Merrill Lynch,
the richest and biggest
retail brokerage firm in the world.
He took the key position
of Treasury Secretary
so he could enact the tax cuts
that the rich wanted.
Regan then became
White House Chief of Staff
as the president started to fade.
Then they should give the president
what 43 governors have,
a line-item veto.
- And...
- ( applause )
- You're gonna have to speed it up.
- Oh.
Moore: Who tells the president
to speed it up?
The man from Merrill Lynch,
that's who.
Things in America would never
be the same again.
The country would now be run
like a corporation.
We're going to turn the bull loose.
( cheering, applause )
Moore: And four years later,
when Reagan ran for reelection,
it was all smiley faces
and happy talk.
l really feel that we're gonna
be better off in the long run.
We're on the upward swing
and the factories are working
much stronger than before.
We're back on top.
Moore: Actually,
what Reagan presided over
was the wholesale dismantling
of our industrial infrastructure.
This was not done to save money
or remain competitive,
as companies back then
were already posting
record earnings in the billions.
No, it was done
for short-term profits...
and to destroy the unions.
Millions of people
were thrown out of work
and the remaining workers
were told to work twice as hard.
But wages for working people
remained frozen.
The richest Americans
had their top income tax rate
cut in half.
lnstead of being paid
a decent wage,
we were encouraged
to live on borrowed money
until our household debt
was nearly 100% of the GDP.
There was an explosion
of personal bankruptcies.
We found it necessary to lock up
millions of our citizens.
Sales of antidepressants
skyrocketed
as insurance
and pharmaceutical company greed
pushed the cost
of healthcare up and up.
All of this was great news
for the stock market
and for America's CEOs.
Moore:
Half of Flint was now receiving
some form
of government welfare.
During the end
of the Reagan years,
l made my first movie about
what had happened to the country
and specifically to my hometown
of Flint, Michigan,
the birthplace of General Motors.
GM was posting profits
of over $4 billion
while at the same time eliminating
tens of thousands of jobs.
l went to see GM's chief lobbyist
in Flint, Mr. Tom Kay,
to ask him why
this was happening.
General Motors wouldn't be doing
anybody any service
if it goes bankrupt.
lt has to do what it has to do
in order to stay competitive
in today's economic climate.
Moore: Even if that means
eliminating 18,000 jobs?
Even if it means
eliminating 20,000 jobs.
- Or 30,000?
- Whatever.
- How about all the jobs here in Flint?
- lt could feasibly happen.
Moore: And it did.
Nearly all the jobs were eliminated
and GM went bankrupt.
Perhaps more distressing was the fact
that the rest of America
was now starting to resemble
Flint, Michigan.
But there were some cities
that still took pride in their greatness.
"" Cleveland ""
"" Come on down
to Cleveland Town, everyone ""
"" Come and look
at both of our buildings ""
"" Here's the place where
there used to be industry ""
"" This train is carrying jobs
out of Cleveland ""
"" See the sun almost
three times a year ""
"" This guy has at least two DUls ""
"" Our economy's
based on LeBron James ""
"" Buy a house
for the price of a VCR ""
"" Our main export
is crippling depression ""
"" We're so retarded
that we think this is art ""
"" lt could be worse, though,
at least we're not Detroit ""
"" We're not Detroit. ""
Moore:
No, they're not Detroit.
For 20 years l tried
to warn GM and others
that this day was coming,
but to no avail.
Maybe now they'd listen.
So l went down to the headquarters
of General Motors
one last time to share
some of my ideas.
You don't have permission.
You can't film here.
Huh?
You don't have permission
from General Motors.
- You can't film here.
- l'm just going up to see the chairman.
No, sir.
No, sir.
You know, l've been doing this
for, like, 20 years.
l understand, sir.
And l have not been
let into this building for 20 years,
and l think it's about time
someone just let me in
and let me talk to them.
l've got some good ideas.
4-7 to 7-6 Bravo Area Alpha.
Man:
Go ahead.
lt's Michael Moore here
to see the chairman.
Repeat that.
lt's the filmmaker
Mr. Michael Moore.
He's here to see the chairman.
- Gentlemen.
- Yes.
You need to get prior permission.
You cannot film here, okay?
But if l can't go in and get permission,
what am l supposed to do?
l guess they're right.
Breaking up is hard to do.
Stop that. Don't do that.
Just go in the building.
Moore: For 35 years,
GM made more money
than any other corporation.
But eventually,
Germany and Japan
rebuilt their car industry
and produced vehicles
that were safer than ours,
more fuel efficient
and rarely, if ever, broke down.
ln Germany, unions help hire and fire
the board of directors
so the workers have a say
in what's going on.
You see, the people
of Japan and Germany
fight to make sure that even
their conservative political leaders
don't destroy their middle class.
So where exactly
are we right now?
On the day that General Motors
declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy,
l went with my dad to visit
the AC Spark Plug plant
where he had worked
for over 30 years.
- So you worked actually right here.
- You'd have to go--
they had a ramp that took you
up over that, just beyond that...
- Just beyond that space there?
- Yeah.
- And then the factory was all over there?
- Yeah.
Moore: The whole complex
is, like, two miles long.
l remember Mom bringing
us kids in to pick you up.
- 2:30 every day.
- Yeah, uh-huh.
You'd walk out of there,
right over in there in fact.
And we'd be waiting
in the car for you
and we'd see you
come down the ramp.
We got real excited
every time we saw you.
l was there 33 1/2 years.
- 33 1/2 years?
- Uh-huh.
Moore: What's your best memory here,
being here, working here?
My best memory?
l think the people.
They were a really good bunch.
- You liked the crowd you worked with?
- Yeah.
Frank Moore:
A good place to work. l enjoyed it.
But l'm sorry to see it go.
Moore:
Shortly before Christmas 2008,
Republic Windows & Doors
in Chicago, lllinois,
abruptly fired
its entire unionized workforce
of over 250 people.
They were given
only three days' notice.
Bank of America
would no longer provide
a line of credit to the company,
and so the workers were not paid
the money owed to them.
Man #1 : My life revolves
around this job.
l live according to my obligation
to my job, you know?
And it's not just me,
it's all of the workers here.
We go above and beyond
the call of duty for Republic.
And at the end,
Republic cares nothing for us.
Man #2: We found out that
they're gonna shut the plant on Tuesday.
We don't deserve what
they're doing to us, you know?
lt really hurts because,
like l said,
this is my second family.
So it was-- it really hurts.
lt really hurts.
l'm gonna miss
all of them, you know?
l'm gonna miss them
and l don't think
anybody on this planet
deserves what they've done to us.
Moore: Scenes like this
were being repeated
all over the country,
and no one seemed to mind.
"" Zambezi, Zambezi ""
- "" Zambezi, Zam. ""
- Woman: Whoo!
Moore: The president was enjoying
his final year in office.
But as the economy
started to fall apart,
he decided it was time
to roll out the C word.
Capitalism is the best system
ever devised.
Moore:
Huh. Really?
Voices from the left and right
are equating the free enterprise system
with greed and exploitation
and failure.
Moore:
Hmm, greed,
exploitation, failure?
Go on, l'm listening.
Capitalism offers people
the freedom to choose
where they work
and what they do...
Reporter: Pat Andrews
has been looking for work.
Every morning she scans
the classifieds in vain.
There isn't anything in here.
l'm not gonna be a gentleman's club
hired dancer either.
...the opportunity to buy
or sell products they want.
Reporter: Tom Rendon
has avoided layoffs
at his sign company
in Stockton, California,
all because this one word
now makes up
for half his business.
lf you seek social justice
and human dignity,
the free market system
is the way to go.
( applause )
Moore: And for those seeking
justice in Pennsylvania,
free enterprise
was definitely the way to go.
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,
has one of the highest rates
in the state
of young people locked up
in the juvenile home.
Perhaps it's because
the good people here
employ the practices
of capitalism
in dealing with
their wayward youth.
The county hired a private
profit-making corporation
with a sweet-sounding name,
PA Child Care.
lt was owned and run
by two businessmen,
one of whom was Robert Powell,
an attorney and entrepreneur.
His good friend Judge Conahan
closed down
the public juvenile home
and then got
PA Child Care to build
an $8 million
privately-owned facility
and charge it back to the county
for a mere $58 million lease.
Let's meet some of Wilkes-Barre's
juvenile delinquents.
Magee smoked pot
at a high school party.
l was very rebellious
when l was at this age.
Moore: Matt, he got into
an argument at the dinner table.
l threw a piece of meat,
as in steak,
cooked dinner,
at my mother's boyfriend.
Moore: Jamie got in a fight
at a shopping mall
with her best friend.
l just figured, you know, we just weren't
gonna be friends anymore.
Moore: And Hillary made
a MySpace page
making fun
of her assistant principal
for being strict and having
no sense of humor.
And it said some pretty silly,
like, 14-year-old-girl stuff.
Moore: Her assistant principal
called the police.
They all appeared before
kindly Judge Mark Ciavarella.
These kids were about
to get their first lesson
in American capitalism:
time is money, lots of money.
l went in front of the court,
in front of Mr. Ciavarella,
and l wasn't even in front of him
for four minutes.
l was only in front of him
for, like, two minutes.
Hillary: The first thing that
Judge Ciavarella said to me was,
''What makes you think
you can do this kind of crap?''
l'm sure he knew in his mind
when l walked in
that he was locking this kid up
no matter what.
He didn't even look at me.
Once l entered the courtroom,
l didn't have any chance.
There was about six kids
who went in front of me.
Every single kid who went
in front of Ciavarella,
for all different reasons--
some minor, some serious--
got sent away.
Moore: Although Wilkes-Barre is located
in the United States of America,
here capitalism
trumped democracy.
Robert Powell, one of the owners
of PA Child Care,
cut a business deal with Judge Conahan
and Judge Ciavarella.
Judge Ciavarella then stepped up
his conviction rates.
Many of these kids
were funneled
into PA Child Care's
for-profit juvenile facility.
And for their troubles,
the judges received
over $2.6 million
while the owners of PA Child Care
received tens of millions
of taxpayer dollars
from the county.
And where did Powell go
to enjoy all that money?
On his private plane
and his yacht,
the ''Reel Justice.''
6,500 children
were unjustly convicted.
lt was good business
while it lasted.
Reporter #1 : Two Luzerne County
judges in big trouble with the law.
They're going to jail.
Reporter #2:
Some kids were locked up
even when probation officers
objected to detention.
ln there you lose track of time
and you lose track of the date.
l was barely keeping track.
lt was supposed to be, like--
l believe it was, like, two months.
And it went from two months
to nine months.
He said originally
three to six months,
but somehow l ended up
being there 11 1/2 months
and l never went back
in front of the judge at all
for him to give me extensions.
Moore:
Not only did PA Child Care
pay off the judges
to fill their cells,
but their employees were the ones
who got to decide
when a child had
enough rehabilitation.
But that makes sense,
because any time a governmental unit
turns over to
a profit-making corporation
the duties it should be performing,
what do you expect to happen?
Matt: lt makes me feel like
an item that they just used
to just get money
and then tossed me aside.
l'm just trying
to work on my flying
and just trying to prepare
for my future
so l can put this all behind me,
finally be done with all this.
During the whole trial
l wasn't in control at all,
but with flying it's only me.
lt's just that l just get
to do everything by myself.
l'm the only one on the control.
Moore:
Matt loves to fly
and hopes to become
a pilot someday.
lf he does,
he'll get his second lesson
in capitalism:
that in America,
sometimes you're better off
working at Mickey D's.
- ( applause, cheering )
- Remember Sully?
Captain Sullenberger,
who safely landed an airbus
in the Hudson River
- saving the lives of 150 passengers?
- ( patriotic music playing )
- Man: A true American hero.
- ( applause )
Moore: He met the mayor.
He went to the State of the Union.
Heck, he even went
to the Super Bowl.
And then he went to Congress.
Sullenberger:
Flying has been my lifelong passion.
But while l love my profession,
l do not like
what has happened to it.
- ( music halts )
- lt is my personal experience
that my decision to remain
in the profession l love
has come at a great financial cost
to me and to my family.
My pay has been cut 40% .
My pension, like most airline pensions,
has been terminated.
So please do not think l exaggerate
when l say that l do not know
a single professional airline pilot
who wants his or her children
to follow in their footsteps.
Moore: Whoa, you cleared
the room with that one, Sully.
l don't think the congressmen
wanted to hear that stuff.
- They like you as a hero.
- The current experience...
( patriotic music over dialogue )
Moore: What was
your starting pay as a pilot?
l made $19,000 the first year.
l was bumped up to about 22,000
or 23,000 the second year.
Last year, gross pay
l made $17,600.
There's a joke in the airline
when we get our wings pinned on us
as new-hire airline pilots
that the company just kinda says,
''Hey, don't apply for food stamps
in your uniform.''
Moore: l don't know about you,
but l want the pilot
who's got me 30,000 feet up in the air
to be paid really well
and not sitting up in the cockpit
digging through the pilot's seat
looking for loose change.
There was a period
of about four months
where l was on food stamps.
- You were on food stamps?
- Yes.
- And you were still flying the plane?
- Yes.
With my--
with my food stamp card.
The lady l talked to
in the food stamp office,
when l told her l was a pilot,
she didn't bat an eye,
but she didn't--
l knew she didn't believe me.
Moore: How have you gotten by?
How have you been able to afford things?
Relying on credit cards
to buy the groceries at times
- when l wasn't on food stamps.
- Oh, really?
l have about $10,000
in credit card debt
just on the necessities,
not on the big-screen TV
and the stereo.
Moore: You're using it
to buy your groceries and get by.
- Yes.
- Do you have any student loan debt?
- Yes.
- How much?
Mine is about 80,000.
- l took out $100,000.
- Moore: Student loans?
And by the time l pay it back,
at this rate,
it'll probably cost me well over
a half a million with interest
and fees and penalties.
lt's something that l don't--
l don't like to spend a lot of time
thinking about
because it's abysmal.
lt's one way that l get down
really quickly
about my chosen career field
is to think about how much l owe
and how little l make.
Moore: Have you had to work
a second job to make ends meet?
l walk dogs on the side,
l distribute MonaVie Juice.
l have known pilots
to donate plasma
for extra cash.
- You mean they give blood?
- They-- well--
So they can make extra money
even though they're flying an airplane?
Yeah.
They donate their plasma.
So they get the blood back,
but you can get paid for plasma.
- ( chuckles )
- Oh, l see.
They suck the blood out of you,
take the plasma...
- Give you the blood back.
- ...give you the--
Oh, well then,
not such a bad deal.
The only reason people stay flying
is because they love it.
And managements
take advantage of that.
The airlines
have managed to farm out
a lot of the flying to commuters
in an effort to basically
bust the unions.
You can't compete
to a lower and lower level
every year
without skimping
on safety somehow.
Moore: At approximately 10:15 PM
on February 1 2, 2009,
Continental connection flight 3407
began its descent
to the airport in Buffalo.
( sirens wailing )
Man: Stand by, there's some
ground communication,
either state police
or sheriff's department.
We need to find out if anything
is on the ground.
This aircraft was five miles out,
and all of a sudden
we have no response
to that aircraft.
All l could tell you is there was
an aircraft over the marker
and we're not talking to them now.
Moore:
No one survived the crash
and 50 people lost their lives.
The media focused
on the actions of the pilots.
Reporter: Captain Marvin Renslow
and First Officer Shaw
were chatting about their careers.
Moore:
''Careers'' is a euphemism
for what the pilots
were really talking about:
how little they were paid
and how overworked they were.
There would be
no discussion in the media
about why we have
an economic system
that allows a pilot to be paid less
than a manager at Taco Bell.
Reporter:
First Officer Shaw
made between
$16,000 and $20,000 a year
and at one point
worked a second job.
Moore: Her second job
had been waitressing
at a coffee shop.
How are these companies
able to get away with this?
( laughs )
l guess that's the point of capitalism.
lt allows you to get away
with anything,
like making a profit
off the death of an employee.
Sweetie, l can open it.
Let's try it with this.
Moore:
This is lrma Johnson.
lrma's husband Dan
worked in middle management
at Amegy Bank in Houston, Texas.
- Wanna try to spread it?
- No.
Moore:
Dan recently died of cancer,
leaving behind lrma
and their two sons.
But unbeknownst to lrma,
Amegy had taken out
a secret life insurance policy
on Dan's life.
The bank generously named itself
as the beneficiary
in the event of Dan's death.
The insurance company
then accidentally informed lrma
that Amegy Bank had received
a check for $1 1/2 million
just weeks after Dan died.
Thank you for helping.
Johnson:
They never told me.
l wanted to find out, well,
why did they purchase a policy for him?
- Moore: You didn't know about it?
- No.
And they named themselves
as the beneficiary.
Yeah.
Moore:
So your husband's death
made them $1.5 million richer?
Mm-hmm.
l know it's not right
for them to try to profit
from my husband's death.
When l first realized
what was happening,
l was in disbelief.
- lt's hurtful.
- l'm so sorry.
Um...
it's hurtful and l wanted answers.
Moore: lrma contacted
Michael D. Myers,
a local attorney who had
already been looking into
these kind of corporate
insurance policies on their employees.
With the normal use of life insurance,
where you're guarding against
the loss of a loved one
or a breadwinner of the family,
you don't want that person to die.
With these policies,
the companies that buy these
want the employees to die
in accordance
with the policy projections.
You are more valuable dead
to a company than alive.
American Greetings, RR Donnelly & Sons,
and Proctor & Gamble
are all having problems
with mortality.
These four combined programs
are running at 50%
of expected mortality.
These clients are acutely aware
of this problem.
Basically here the broker
is complaining
that not enough
employees are dying.
And therefore the investment returns
are not matching the projections.
The broker writes
that NCC is running
at 78% of expected mortality.
Okay, so 78% of the people
we expected to die died.
But the problem with that
is three of them were suicides.
And you can't count
on that every year.
Moore: Can you think
of any other situation
were you'd actually want
people to die?
Combatants in war, l guess.
Wow, when do you want
people to die?
l-l don't know.
War situations,
terrorism situations.
Drug trials, perhaps.
l don't know.
l don't know.
That's an odd question.
Moore: l didn't understand
how any of this could be legal.
After all, there's a reason
that there's a law
prohibiting me from taking out
a fire insurance policy on your house
because l have a vested interest
in your house burning down.
Since Attorney Myers had been
researching this for years,
l asked him which companies
were profiting
from these insurance policies.
l don't know,
you don't know,
because there's no place
you can go and find out
whether your company
is a purchaser
- of these types of products.
- Which ones do you know?
The ones that we know
that have slipped out are
Bank of America, Citibank,
Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie,
Proctor & Gamble,
McDonnell Douglas, Hershey,
Nestlé , AT&T,
Southwestern Bell,
Ameritech, American Express--
- This is blue chip you're talking about.
- Yeah.
These aren't fly-by-night companies
trying to do a scam here
so they can collect a check
if one of their employees dies.
There are probably
several million Americans
who are covered by one of these policies
or have been at some point.
There's a lot of it out there.
Moore:
This is Paul Smith.
He used to be what is known
as a loyal employee.
Smith: l worked for Wal-Mart
for 18 years and l gave them 110% .
l mean, l loved that company.
And as it turned out,
Wal-Mart took out
over 350,000
life insurance policies
on rank and file associates.
These weren't executives.
These were people like my wife,
a cake decorator for 18 months.
That's the type of people they were taking
insurance policies out on.
Moore: Paul's wife LaDonna
left her job at the Wal-Mart bakery
so she could be a stay-at-home mom
for her two kids.
Smith:
She had asthma real real bad.
She went into
the emergency room one night
and a nurse comes out and says,
''Are you Mr. Smith?''
And l said, ''Yes.''
And she said, ''We don't think
your wife's gonna make it.''
Moore:
LaDonna slipped into a coma
from which she would
never awaken.
Her family rushed to the hospital,
even though there was nothing
they could do to help.
There was a wall here
and LaDonna's in the room
on the other side of the wall.
And Jessica kept saying,
''Where is she?''
And l said, ''She's right on
the other side of that wall.''
And Jessica said,
''Can we cut a hole in the wall
so that we can see her?''
And that just sticks with me.
Do you remember that?
Smith: We had to stay in there with her,
and so we'd write letters to her.
''My dear wife, l miss you more
than any words can possibly say.
You are my life.
You always see beauty
in the simplest things.
l've always admired you for that.
l wish l could have told you that more.
l want you to come back
to me soon.
l still have a lot left to learn
from you, baby doll.
Your loving husband, Paul.''
You okay, Wesley?
She was 26 years old.
LaDonna: You're silly.
You're silly.
Myers: The younger a person is,
the higher the benefit is
because they're expected
to live longer.
Women are also expected
to live longer than men.
So the most valuable employee
to the company
if they're dead,
is a young woman.
Moore:
LaDonna's death earned
one of the richest corporations
in the world
an extra $81,000.
l was faced with over $100,000
worth of medical bills
and a $6,000 funeral
and Wal-Mart didn't offer a penny
to help with that.
l did trust them.
And never in a million years
would l have ever thought
that somewhere
on a profit statement,
''Dead associate, $81,000.''
Wal-Mart doesn't care about you.
When someone passes away,
they shouldn't get
something out of it.
Myers: The common denominator
to each form of coverage
is that when the employee dies,
the employer gets paid
the insurance benefits.
They're often referred to
as ''dead peasant insurance.''
Moore: Dead peasants?
Why'd they use such a creepy name?
Myers: lt's very creepy.
l don't know what it means either.
Dead is clear.
That's the worker who's passed away,
so they're dead.
Peasant, l don't know why
they chose that word.
l don't know if it has
some historical significance
or that's just the way they view
the relative value
of the employees' lives.
Dead peasants?
Yeah, amongst themselves
that's what they call it.
lt's insulting to refer
to my husband like that.
( sniffles )
Moore:
lt turned out that Amegy Bank
had a second
dead peasant policy on Dan,
bringing their total take
to nearly $5 million.
- ls capitalism a sin?
- Father Dick Preston: Yes.
- ls capitalism a sin?
- Father Dick Preston: Yes.
Capitalism for me and for many of us
at this present moment is an evil.
lt's contrary to all that's good.
lt's contrary to the common good.
lt's contrary to compassion.
lt's contrary to
all of the major religions.
Capitalism is precisely
what the holy books,
our holy books in particular,
remind us is unjust
and in some form and fashion,
God will come down
and eradicate somehow.
Moore:
This was Father Dick Preston,
the priest from Flint
who married my wife and me.
Preston:
Capitalism is wrong,
and therefore
has to be eliminated.
Moore:
Eliminated?
That might be a little harsh,
so l decided to go
and talk to the priest
that married my sister
and brother-in-law.
l'm sure he would have
a more balanced approach
when it came to capitalism.
lt is immoral, it is obscene,
it is outrageous.
You know...
it is really radical evil.
lt's radically evil.
Moore: Wow, does their boss know
that they're talking like this?
l thought it best to go
and check this out with the bishop.
Bishop Thomas Gumbleton:
The system doesn't seem to be
providing for the well being
of all the people.
And that's what makes it
almost in its very nature
something contrary
to Jesus who said,
''Blessed are the poor,
woe to the rich.''
That's right out
of St. Luke's gospel.
Moore: How have we put up
with this system for so long?
l mean, it's--
they talk about--
The system has built into it
what we call propaganda.
l'm in awe of propaganda--
the ability to convince people
who are victimized
by this very system
to support the system
and see it as good.
We know that American capitalism
is morally right
because its chief elements--
private ownership,
the profit motive
and the competitive market--
are wholesome and good.
They are compatible with God's laws
and the teachings of the Bible.
Moore: For as long
as l can remember,
l've been told that competition
and profit are good things.
( distorted )
They are compatible with God's laws
and the teachings of the Bible.
Moore: And if increasing profits
means locking up a few kids
or cashing in on the death
of an employee...
( distorted ) Compatible with God's laws
and the teachings of the Bible.
Moore: ...it is morally right to provide
for the stockholders.
( distorted )
They are compatible with God's laws
and the teachings of the Bible.
Moore:
Debt, eviction and exploitation.
( distorted )
God's laws and the teachings of the Bible.
Moore: What were we really
pledging our allegiance to?
( distorted )
The profit motive.
Moore: And so all good Americans
came to act as if they believed
our capitalist economic system
was compatible
with the teachings of the Bible.
( organ music playing )
When l was a kid,
l wanted to be a priest.
lt wasn't because
of the fancy getups
or the Knights of Columbus
escorts,
or even the groovy nuns
who were so good to me.
lt was because of the priests
who went on the march from Selma,
or tried to stop the war,
or devoted their lives to the poor.
They told me quite clearly
what Jesus said,
that the first shall be last
and the last shall be first;
That the rich man
will have a very hard time
getting into heaven;
That we will be judged by how
we treat the least among us;
And that there are no people
more important to God
than the poor.
Since that time,
it seems that Jesus got hijacked
by a lot of people who believe
that the son of God
was sent here to create
heaven on earth for the well-to-do.
l must have missed
that part of the Bible
where Jesus became a capitalist.
Man:
Please tell me, master,
what must l do
to have eternal life?
Go forth and maximize profits.
You say the Kingdom of Heaven
is at hand,
but when exactly will it come?
When you deregulate
the banking industry.
- ( voices overlapping )
- Help me.
l've been this way for 20 years.
l'm sorry, l cannot heal
your pre-existing condition.
He'll have to pay out of pocket.
Moore: Somehow, l don't think
Jesus came to earth
so he could ring the bell
at the New York Stock Exchange.
And yet,
from the very beginning,
the rich have claimed him
for their own.
When l'm on Wall Street
and l realize
that that's the very nerve center
of American capitalism,
and l realize
what capitalism has done
for working people in America,
to me that's a holy place.
Let me add to it.
Over the whole duration of the lraq war
and the terror war,
you look at the world's stock markets
and you look at the world economy,
and despite these horrible pockets
of unrest and killing and murdering
that we've been describing,
it's never been better.
The global economy
has never been better
and the global stock markets
have never been better, Jimmy.
lt is either a God-given miracle
or it has something to do
with the victories
of the spreading world
of capitalism or both.
Moore: They think
Wall Street's a holy place.
What do you think
Jesus would think of capitalism?
l think he would
simply refuse to--
to be part of it.
Moore: Jesus would refuse
to be part of it,
but he probably had
a special place up there
for whoever leaked
a secret Citibank memo
about their plan to rule the world.
Back in 2005 and 2006,
Citigroup wrote
three confidential memos
to their wealthiest investors
about how things were going.
They reached the conclusion
that the United States
was no longer
really a democracy,
but had become a plutonomy--
a society controlled exclusively
by and for the benefit
of the top 1 %
of the population
who now had
more financial wealth
than the bottom 95% combined.
The memo gloated about the growing gap
between rich and poor
and how they were now
the new aristocracy
and that there was no end in sight
for the gravy train they were on.
There was, though,
one problem.
According to Citigroup,
the most potent
and short-term threat
would be societies demanding
a more equitable share
of the wealth.
ln other words,
the peasants might revolt.
Citigroup lamented
that the non-rich
might not have
much economic power,
but they do have
equal voting power with the rich.
One person, one vote.
And that's what
really scares them--
that we can still vote.
ln fact, we have
99% of the votes
and they only have 1 % .
So why do the 99%
put up with this?
According to Citigroup,
it's because the majority of the electorate
believe that someday
they will have a chance
of becoming
well-to-do themselves
if they just keep trying
hard enough.
The wealthy were pleased
that so many people
had bought in
to the American Dream
while they, the rich,
had no intention
of ever sharing it with anyone.
l think capitalism is a lot more
important than democracy.
l'm not even a big believer
in democracy.
l always say that democracy is--
can be two wolves and a sheep
deciding on what to have
for dinner.
Moore: This is Stephen Moore--
no relation--
a columnist
and an editorial board member
of ''The Wall Street Journal,''
the daily bible
of corporate America.
Look, l'm in favor of people
having the right to vote
and things like that, but you know
there are a lot of countries
that have the right to vote
that are still poor.
Democracy doesn't always lead
to a good economy
or even a good political system.
With capitalism, you are free
to do what you want,
to make whatever you want
out of yourself.
lt doesn't mean
you're gonna succeed.
Remember, the US Constitution
does not guarantee happiness.
Moore:
Ah, the Constitution.
All my life l've heard that America
is a capitalist country.
So l went to see the original Constitution
and check out if it was true.
l'm trying to see where it sets up
our economic system,
like where it says we have
a capitalist economy.
Guard:
The jurisdiction.
- Judicial part of the--
- Down there?
Moore: There was no mention
of free market or free enterprise
or capitalism anywhere.
ln fact, all l saw
was ''We the people,''
something about
''a more perfect union,''
and ''promoting
the general welfare.''
Welfare, union, we?
That sounded like that other -ism.
But no, that's democracy.
And l began to wonder,
''What would it be like
And l began to wonder,
''What would it be like
if the workplace
was a democracy?''
There's always been a big separation
between how the country is run
and how businesses
are supposed to run.
Moore:
lt's true.
There seems to be a disconnect
between our professed love
of democracy
and how we're so willing
to accept a dictatorship
every day we show up to work.
lt's not that way
at lsthmus Engineering in Wisconsin.
They design and build
robotic machines for industry.
lt's a $15 million-a-year business.
Man:
All of the workers
are the owners of the business.
Moore: He's not talking about
some bullshit stock option.
He means they're the true owners.
Man: And it's a democratically-run
operation where every member
has one vote and an equal say.
- All in favor?
- All in favor?
Man: lt takes the money
out of the equation.
Moore: By taking the money
out of the equation
so that they can call the shots,
they end up making more money.
Cool, huh?
And how patriotic
that they want to extend
their love of American democracy
to their job.
Just imagine if the place
where you worked
was run by you
and your fellow workers.
You probably wouldn't
lay off your coworkers
to increase the value
of your stock, would you?
Or give yourself
a pay raise
while making your coworkers
take a pay cut.
Man:
We don't really do that here.
You really can't because everyone else
would be looking at you
saying, ''Why is this guy
so fricking greedy?''
You know,
it would be too obvious.
The bottom line is you've
got plenty of people
who roll up their sleeves
every day and go to work.
But if there's someone
way up there on the chain
that collects all the extra money,
that's not fair.
Moore:
Huh, fairness in the workplace--
what a novel idea.
Out in California,
there's a bread factory
where workers make thousands
of loaves of bread every day
Man:
The more hours you work towards
the benefit
of the co-op,
the more you share
in the profits.
Man #2:
The workers are happy here.
No big ls, little yous.
Everyone's the same.
Me as the CEO,
l get the same share
that anybody else does.
And that has proven
to be very lucrative
for us as workers.
Moore: Assembly-line workers here
earn over $65,000 a year,
more than
three times the pay
for a starting pilot
at American Eagle.
Man: l'm just hoping
that people take notice
of this type
of organizational activity
and start considering it
as an alternative.
Why do you want
to get rich?
How many cars do
you really need in life?
Moore: Clearly, he's not a car guy,
but that's okay.
His bread factory and hundreds of other
worker-owned businesses
are proof that people aren't always
motivated by profit.
( fanfare )
Announcer:
An historic victory over a dread disease.
Moore: lnstead of using his genius
to make a ton of money,
Dr. Jonas Salk spent
all of his time
putting monkey kidneys
in a blender
trying to find a cure
for polio.
And when he did,
he decided to give it away for free.
This man could have been rich
many times over
had he sold his vaccine
to a pharmaceutical company.
But he thought
his talents should be used
for the greater good.
And the decent salary
he made as a doctor
and a research professor
was enough for him to live
a comfortable life.
Who owns the patent
on this vaccine?
Well, the people,
l would say.
There is no patent.
Would you patent the sun?
Moore: Yes, we've come a long way
since the days of Dr. Salk.
Because today our best minds
are used for something else.
Where do we send our top
math and science people?
Where do we send our top
math and science people?
lnto finance.
They don't go into
science in America.
They go to Wall Street.
Moore: Today's students,
unlike in Dr. Salk's time,
can graduate from college
with a student loan debt
of up to $100,000 or more.
These students are then
beholden to the banks
for the next 20 years.
And the best way for them
to pay off these banks
is to go to work for them
instead of working
for the common good.
Black: We've taken people that could
be enormously productive--
just what we're short of
in America--
and we take them and we
put them in an activity
that isn't simply less
productive,
but where they're
actually destructive;
where actually every day they work,
they make the world worse.
Moore: So what exactly were the top
students from Harvard
and other schools
working on these days?
Derivatives... derivatives...
derivatives... derivatives...
Credit default swaps.
l can't make any sense
out of this.
l might as well quit.
Moore:
That's exactly how l felt
