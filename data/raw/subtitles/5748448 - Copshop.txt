Ooh, what's that?
- What's what?
- The box with the bow?
My daughter Sasha
is turning 21 in two days.
Clem's brother's got
a really good hookup resell
in, uh, Laughlin.
You got her a gun?
I just told you,
she's turning 21.
You got her a gun
from a Roach Coach.
So Clem's one-stop shopping
for life-shortening and shit,
cheeseburgers, guns.
Does he deep-fry bullets?
He might. You can damn near
deep fry anything these days.
Well, I never got a gun
when I turned 21.
I don't know
what you talking about.
How much did you spend
on that Ruger, rookie?
Which is a single-action weapon
from the ass-end of the 1800s
and damn near useless
in a 21st century gunfight.
It's not the brush,
it's the artiste.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Unit to clear
for 10-11, possible ABW,
Code 5 at Indian Springs Casino.
- Enter to clear.
- Shit.
3-Edwards-20 responding,
en route.
Mm. Goddammit!
Can't even fucking eat
a cheese...
Let me enjoy my meal.
Shit!
This is a fucking mess.
Back off, back off,
I'm telling you!
I'm gonna let you finish
that heart attack
and I'mma go protect and serve.
Be right there, rookie.
I protect and serve better
on a full stomach.
Hey, break it up!
Break it up!
Break it up! Hey! Hey!
Break it up! Break it up!
Stupid, drop that guy!
Hey, what kind of wedding
is this?
Now which one of you wanna spend
the night in county lockup?
That's what I thought.
- Oh!
- World star!
- Dang!
- Oh!
I did not mean to lean into
that, lady. I'm really sorry.
- Hands in the air!
- Get on the ground, now!
Which one of you
gonna arrest me?
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Alright. Somebody arrest me.
On the ground.
Get on the ground.
Will one of you people
please fucking arrest...
You're under arrest.
Oh, my gosh.
Kim!
I'm coming.
Well, what do we have here?
Picked up a boy toy for you,
Kim.
Oh, aren't you just the sweetest
thing on God's Green Forty?
And look
at this pretty blue purse.
Can I get my cell?
The only cell
you're getting is the one
you're spending the night in.
Good Lord, wonder
what happened to your eye.
This charming man.
Hit a woman?
Teddy, you're bleeding... a lot.
Whoa, what the hell is this?
A bullet by, he got shot.
Get him downstairs,
get him stitched up.
Maybe the boredom
will get him talking.
Damn, your mama didn't love you
at all.
- Ha-ha...
- My God, what the fuck?
You're telling me.
I mean, I know of...
I, I never watched it,
I never watched it
Hey, what the hell
is going on?
Who's on intake?
Last week
you're just bitching about
not getting enough overtime
and now here you are jawing away
like a bunch
of fucking old ladies.
- Get back to work.
- Uh, sorry, Mitchell.
"Sorry Mitchell,"
my ass.
Officer Huber.
Where the fuck
are my evidence inventories?
The ones I've been asking for,
for two weeks?
Uh, uh, I'm on it.
"I'm on it."
I hate that fucking phrase.
I prefer get it fucking done.
Is there some kind
of goddamn inside bet
to raise my damn blood pressure
every fucking second
of every goddamn day?
- Looks like a cop car.
- Central State, 10-Otis-10.
Shitload of bullets everywhere.
- 10-Otis-10.
- Windows are busted.
10-Otis-10.
Kim, get the fuck out
the damn bathroom.
Jesus Christ! Got the bladder
of a fucking toddler.
- This is 50. Over.
- We have 11-55 up Ariat Road.
It's an unmarked Crown Vic
with a dash lamp.
I can't find it registered
anywhere.
- Vehicle's also shot up.
- Copy, 10-Otis-10.
Clarify shot up,
please.
- Do you mean bullet damage?
- Hey, stop, buddy.
- Stop! Shit! Look out!
- Yeah...
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
10-Otis-10, is everything okay?
Oh, shit. Ah...
Copy, 10-Otis-10,
this is 50. Over.
Ah, fucker.
What the fuck!
Stay down! Stay the fuck down!
- The fuck is wrong with you?
- Shrunk off in size.
10-Otis-10?
10-Otis-10, is everything okay?
You're doing a little drinking
tonight, asshole?
You've been doing
a lot more than a little.
10-Otis-10,
is everything okay?
Yeah, well...
You almost killed
a state trooper, you dumb fuck!
Do you need
assistance, 10-Otis-10?
Get him in, get him in.
50,
this is State 10-Otis-10.
Some goddamn drunk
almost ran us down just now.
Can we process him
at your station?
Yeah, it's a slow night,
bring him down.
Alrighty, 50, we're 10-8.
- Give us 30 minutes.
- Alright now, out.
You alright?
Fucking overtime, my ass.
You got fragmentation
here, Teddy.
Someone trying to kill you?
Is that why you were trying
to get arrested tonight?
You got your ass ice-cold,
Teddy.
You assaulted an officer,
that's aggravated battery,
that's mandatory
12 to 18 in county.
So I would take advantage of
my miniscule amount of sympathy
for you getting shot, and talk.
You know, I had this boyfriend
in high school,
Curtis Flores.
My father didn't care for him,
not that he liked
any of my boyfriends,
but he always said about Curtis,
"Honey, that boy is never more
than a day ahead of the devil."
Curtis.
Curtis sounds like a gem.
Whatever happened to him?
He was stabbed and killed
in the parking lot
of an Applebee's.
He let the day get past him,
and the devil was right there.
- Hey, sarge.
- Hey.
We got a unmarked Crown Vic,
full of bullet holes,
just found abandoned
by state troopers.
That mean anything to you,
Teddy?
I want my phone call now.
Operator,
name of the person
you're trying to reach?
Lorraine Faith. F-A-I-T-H.
...to solving
the brutal murder of
Nevada Attorney General William
Fenton who was found slain.
Some of the top police officers
and detectives are on the case.
Can't release any names
as, you know,
we're still gathering
as much information as possible,
but rest assured, we will
continue to work very hard
to find the people responsible,
thank you.
Come on, fucking pick up.
Hey,
it's Lorraine, I can't get
to the phone right now.
Leave a message at the beep.
Hey, listen, it's me again.
I need you to get
the fuck out of the house, okay?
Take Ryan and go somewhere, go
anywhere. Do you understand me?
I sent you the combination,
check your texts.
Check your texts. Nothing
is safe, nothing is safe.
- Time's up, Teddy.
- Nothing.
Okay.
You can let go.
I didn't, I didn't get through.
- Damn.
- Let me just check my cell.
You know, how about you just
give me the code to your cell?
I'll check it for you.
You got something to hide?
Just... just let me check
my phone. Let me check my cell.
I mean how, how's that gonna
hurt you?
Alright,
State law requires that we keep
our intoxicated guests
in separate quarters.
So you got the place
all to yourself.
Hands.
I didn't mean to hit you
so hard.
Oh, aren't you sweet?
Get comfortable, Teddy.
You're gonna be here a while.
- Ooh!
- Holy shit!
- Smells like Satan's asshole.
- Anybody home?
Yeah, this dipshit
nearly killed us.
Bounced his car off
that abandoned
Crown Vic and put it
on the ditch.
Alright, well, I'll get you
a lovely night stay
in here
on a stainless steel cot.
- Any ID?
- None.
Driver's license?
Social Security?
What the hell is this?
- Alright. John Doe it is.
- What the hell is this?
- It's my insulin.
- What is that?
- He's saying insulin?
- I need it. I need it.
He's been talking about
diabetes. You're diabetic.
Aren't you? You diabetic?
Not every fat guy has diabetes.
Can I get a prisoner escort
down to Processing, please?
How is that workout
coming along?
Uh, yeah,
I gave up on the workouts.
- Just make decisions, man.
- Yeah.
I'm making the decision
not to work out.
- Yeah.
- I think he shit himself.
No, no, no, no.
We're not in there.
We're not in there.
We're over here.
You guys stink of booze.
Here we go.
- Hold on.
- Hold him, Ruby.
- Got it.
- Alright.
You okay? You okay, big guy?
- I'm okay.
- Alright.
- Oh...
- The bunk is to your right.
Everyone, stop! Stop!
- He just ate the floor.
- You see that shit?
Hey, it never happened.
You got any food?
I'm famished.
- Just loaf.
- What the hell is loaf?
If you're into that
dried dog shit, it's delicious.
This just ain't your night,
Teddy.
Oh...
What are you in for?
What are you in for?
I sucker-punched a cop.
No, that's not
what you're in for.
You're in
for a lot more than that.
What'd you do?
I did what I had to do...
to get in here.
To get to you, Teddy.
Now it's important
you listen carefully.
- You don't have much time.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey, Teddy!
- Somebody! Hey!
- Listen to me.
914 Glenview Crescent,
apartment number 16.
Who lives there?
A woman and a boy.
What in the fuck
are you guys going on about?
Shut the fuck up!
I just want my food, man.
I want my food.
You shouldn't eat loaf
after midnight.
That shit will give you
nightmares, the big black kind.
Hand me a hotdog, please.
Shut the fuck up, if you guys
keep fucking with me,
I'mma bring the hose in
on both of y'all bitch asses.
Sorry.
What do they want?
You know what they want.
We make a deal?
Listen, Teddy.
I don't want you to think
that you can save yourself,
because you obviously can't.
But there are
other considerations.
Like my ex? It that what
you're talking about? My ex?
Like I give a shit.
The kid ain't even mine, man.
Alright.
What guarantees you give me
you'll spare 'em, hm?
Guarantees aren't mine to give,
Teddy.
You know how this goes, right?
It's up to you where I go next.
You can't do shit to me
in here, pal.
You know what?
Actually,
you can't do a fucking thing.
Hm.
Okay.
What okay? What's that?
What okay?
It is what it is, Teddy.
What do you mean
"It is what it is?"
My ex and my kid... they alive?
Officer Huber.
You on a play date or something?
Where the fuck
are my evidence inventories?
There he is.
They're keeping you in the cage.
You, uh, you finally getting
those inventories
straightened out?
I'm trying.
Fucking Mitchell
wants everything letter-perfect.
- Yeah. It's a pain in my ass.
- Yeah. I bet.
- Are you good otherwise?
- Otherwise what?
I'm worried about you, man.
Uh, grownups fucking men
don't worry about other
grownups fucking men, Barnes.
I'm fine. I'm just... tired
of Mitchell's bullshit.
Yeah. I feel you. He wouldn't
do it if he didn't love you.
Alright.
Look, you don't have to tell me,
but if you ever need to talk,
chat, shoot the shit, whatever.
I'm good, man. You don't have
to worry about me.
- Okay.
- I'm good.
Law-enforcement
officials appear no closer
to solving the brutal murder
of Nevada Attorney General
William Fenton
who was found slain.
We will continue to work both
at the local and state level
to bring the person
or persons responsible
for these senseless murders
to justice.
Yeah. First 48,
tuning 72, tuning 96.
Ha-ha. It's embarrassing.
I mean, he's only
the Attorney General of Nevada.
This fucking guy Murretto
has been busted
more times than I've made busts.
Twenty-two arrests
and no charges.
How does that happen?
- There it is.
- What are you doing?
I'm working on my road roulette.
- Road roulette?
- Yeah.
See, in Indiana
we use the pistol on everything,
squirrels, rabbits.
So my dad came up
with this thing.
You take one round,
drop it in the wheel, spin it.
It's got to land on
that cylinder. Squirrel soup.
And were you any good?
Did you get any squirrels?
I never did. My dad did.
Mm. So you were a failure
in the eyes of your father?
- That tracks. It's cool.
- Ha.
So you're all cocky now 'cause
you got that fancy Blackhawk.
You didn't think I noticed that?
Oh, I'm surprised you noticed it
sitting all comfy, cozy
on my hip.
I'll... I'll quick-draw you
for it.
My Redhawk
versus your Blackhawk.
I got 30 seconds.
Don't let the sarge see us
dicking around.
- We're gonna do this? Today?
- Oh, yeah.
Alright. You ready, gunslinger?
It's your move, cowgirl.
Officer down. Officer down!
You know what? Speed kills.
Oh, I can put
my scrubbing feelers on?
Every time.
Get quicker, man.
Obviously,
you'll be disappointed in this.
I know who you are, pal.
I've heard all about you.
Legendary Bob Viddick.
Some chilling shit
floating around about you.
That poor bastard in Tampa,
you cut off his arm
with a carving knife,
then you beat him to death
with that same arm, right?
It was his leg.
I've heard about
you, too, Teddy.
Say you're very effective.
How you're not dead
a dozen different ways by now
is a cross between a fluke
and fucking miracle.
More magic trick
than anything, really.
Mind over matter.
I give people what they want.
And take more than you need.
Yeah.
Hey, what do you say we cut
through all the bullshit?
- You wanna live.
- That'd be nice.
Alright, and you still think
that's possible
because you haven't been
paying attention,
so you try to buy your way out.
Let's make a deal, man.
I got a lot of money.
You mean the money
you stole from them?
What you fail to understand,
Teddy,
is it's not about
the money anymore.
There's no play here, Teddy.
No deal to be made.
It's a simple choice.
It's never simple.
Are you a fucking idiot?
It is that simple.
[beeping
I'm running out of time, Teddy.
So they're running out of time.
Huber! This is fucking bullshit!
Will somebody get fucking Huber
up here, please?
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you Huber?
You have an open-door policy.
I also have
a no-pain-in-the-ass policy,
but you don't seem
to pay any attention to that.
Twenty-two arrests,
zero convictions.
Who?
Our mystery man, Teddy Murretto.
Have we impounded
that abandoned Crown Vic yet?
Yeah, I just sent
Ruby and Barnes
out to meet
the tow-truck driver.
Did you read
the state trooper's report?
Why the hell would I read
the state trooper's report
when I'm buried
in evidence inventories
that don't make
any goddamn sense?
Will somebody please
get Huber up here now?
You know, you have a phone.
There was a cherry light
and a siren mount on the dash.
- Okay.
- So here's my theory.
Teddy either stole
that unmarked off a cop
or he's impersonating a cop.
He's a fucking
total bullshitter.
Wait him out, 'cause we can
hold him indefinitely.
- Yeah.
- Huber!
If you are within
the sound of my goddamn voice,
get your big ass up here!
Don't make me
come looking for you!
This motherfucker gonna make me
come looking for him.
Huber!
Huber, you in there?
Shit!
Damn! This is bullshit.
Anybody got eyes on Huber?
Get him!
You see him, tell him to get
his ass in my office right now!
Listen to me.
This is harassment, okay?
I'm doing everything that I can.
I've probably gotten about a key
and a half out of evidence.
Do you have any fucking idea
what that entails?
What can happen to me if I...
I know I owe you.
Yes.
What do I need to do?
Ah...
Ah...
The fucking...
Fuck fireball, dude.
This fucking hangover is
gonna be a motherfucking bitch
if I don't get some Aspirin
in me, too.
Aspirin's bad for your liver.
Cool, dude. Thanks.
You a fucking doctor?
Yup.
I got my degree from
the University of Common Sense.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
I didn't think
you studied there.
Huh?
I'm getting a sinking suspicion
that "Huh" is the word
that best describes you.
I'm getting
the fucking suspicion...
Fucking fuck you, dude.
What you got there?
Shh.
Just a minute.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Are you fucking setting an alarm
to remind you
to get your ass kicked?
I wouldn't poke the bear, pal.
- Huh?
- Oh.
- There it is again.
- What?
Oh, that's good.
Change it up. Huh. What.
Keep 'em guessing.
Damn it.
Don't make me fuck you up
in here, alright, man?
You look like a fucking stepdad.
I would slap the shit
out of you.
You're looking at a real one,
son. I don't give a shit!
You feel me?
- I felt that.
- Hey!
Help! Hey, somebody help!
Hey! Help!
- Hey! Help!
- Hey!
- Hey, help!
- Hey, somebody!
- He's having a seizure!
- False alarm, guys.
I got something that caught fire
in one of these evidence bins.
Can someone please bring me
a fucking
fire extinguisher up here?
We're on it.
Jesus Christ, that's loud.
What the fuck is happening?
Where you been, Huber?
Sarge's looking you.
His voice carries.
Hey, who's is this?
That's the douchebag that
clocked Young at the casino.
Is he still down in Holding?
- Help!
- My God!
Somebody please help this man!
He's gonna die!
Situation in Holding! Get
your ass down to Holding now!
- He's gonna die!
- Help!
He's gonna die!
He's gonna die!
He's, he's foaming
at the mouth.
It's like, it's like
he's not gonna make it.
- He did it! He did it! He...
- Oh, my gosh.
- Don't go in there!
- He's not gonna make it!
- Please help him!
- Alright, buddy.
- Oh, my God!
- Watch your back!
...prisoner who doesn't appear
to be breathing.
He did it! Hey, watch your back!
Look out!
Oh, shit! Shit!
We got shots fired!
We got shots fired!
Help!
Help!
He's trying to fucking kill me!
Somebody!
You seem to have sobered up.
I'm gonna need you
to drop that gun
and lower yourself as flat
as a board to the floor for me.
You're shaking.
Yeah. I'm nervous.
It's amazing I haven't blown
your fucking head off.
You assaulted my sergeant
and are attempting an escape.
There's not a jury in Nevada
that would blah, blah, blah.
Drop that fucking gun...
now.
Alright.
What the hell happened?
We need an ambo in here now.
- Check sarge.
- Is he shot?
No, but he was attacked.
And get the other guy
up to the infirmary now.
- He's having trouble breathing.
- Shit.
...laceration
in your head...
Give me your right wrist.
Anything I can do to help,
officer?
Yeah. Shut the fuck up.
I'll be right here
if you need anything.
Move! The fuck you whipping
that hand for?
- Ah, you good?
- Yeah. Perfect.
Right there, to your left.
- Ah, ah...
- Come on.
Show me.
You wanna check 'em?
Sit down.
- Sarge, sit up. Alright.
- Ooh. Hm.
Look at me. Alright.
I think he dislocated your jaw.
I'm gonna have to reset it.
I'm gonna stick my thumbs
in your mouth.
One, two, three.
Okay. Let's get up.
Let's get up.
Alright. Get to the infirmary.
- Get the goddamn door.
- I'm doing it. Come on.
- There you go.
- Alright. Alright.
This guy's bleeding
like a fucking geyser.
Wait, wait, wait. Ah, ah...
Alright, sarge. I got you. Sit.
Kimble, what's with
the fucking ambulance?
Give me a second.
I'm checking on it.
This guy's bleeding like
a fucking geyser.
Alright, sarge.
I think his windpipe is crushed.
What... what...
what are you doing?
I'm gonna have to open his
airway so he can breathe.
No, no. Let's wait on,
let's wait on the ambulance.
- Wait on the ambulance?
- Hey, buddy, buddy.
It's... it's gonna be alright.
Just calm down. Just calm down.
It's okay. Hey,
this is gonna fuck...
Let's just wait for the doctor,
alright?
Alright. I did this in Army
Medical Corps on a cadaver.
O... on a fucking cadaver? Was it
a cadaver before it started?
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What? I'm just, I'm nervous.
I make bad jokes
when I'm nervous.
Then refrain so I...
Let me focus.
- Hey, aren't you left-handed?
- Shut the fuck...
Fuck it! You're left-handed!
Fuck! Just... Are you sure?
Let's just wait
on the ambulance!
Oh, God.
Alright.
Alright.
- Are we steady yet?
- Yeah.
Oh, he's breathing.
Is he breathing?
Hey, we did,
we... we... we did it.
- That's how you...
- Alright.
- That was fucking badass.
- Keep an eye on him.
That was fucking badass,
seriously.
Hey. This is Huber.
I was told to call you.
Yeah. Yes.
Kim.
Fuck.
- Hoo!
- Oh! Jesus! Fuck, Kimble!
- Ha-ha...
- Don't do that!
Motherfucker,
what are you in my biz for?
Yeah, how long does it take
for IAFIS
to turn around prints usually?
Oh, they don't prioritize DUIs.
- So what does that mean?
- It's gonna take a while.
- What's got you so curious?
- Curiosity.
Let's you and me talk,
man to man.
Never more than a day
ahead of the devil, huh?
- Tell me, Teddy.
- Tell you what?
Tell me why Mr. Meryl Streep
back there faked a DUI
to get into this station
for a shot at killing you?
I don't know. Why don't you
ask him? Bob Viddick.
Oh.
Why are you trying to kill him?
Why do you care?
You don't even like him.
Why is he trying to kill you,
Teddy?
Okay. Let's do this.
You can tell me everything
and, I mean,
every last fucking thing.
Or option two,
you can keep smart-assing me,
shrugging off my questions with
that stupid fucking look
on your face,
and I'll put you and your pal
in the same cell together.
You're not gonna do that.
Let's not be ridiculous.
Seriously.
You can't do it.
You're not allowed, remember?
Stop fucking around.
I am as far away
from fucking around
as you can possibly get.
You still drunk?
Sober as a judge.
Hm. You're gonna fuck with me?
Nope. Not you.
- Problem solved.
- Look.
This is way beyond anything you
wanna get involved with, lady.
- You don't fucking understand.
- No.
You don't understand
how incredibly fucking bored
I am.
Okay. Fuck it.
You wanna know?
I'll tell you.
Alright, what I do,
my profession,
I put people together,
high-profile people,
like-minded, shared interests,
movers and shakers
kind of shit.
Cops, politicians,
entrepreneurs, heads of state,
I handle them all.
Call it high-end consultancy.
- You're a fixer.
- No, I hate that fucking term.
I don't fix.
I manufacture opportunities.
She doesn't have
to get hurt, Teddy.
What he knows,
you don't need to know.
I'm all ears.
You read the papers?
That's mostly what I do here.
So you know about
the Nevada Attorney General
that was murdered last week,
Fenton?
Bill, motion is done.
Now, the people I work for,
they got their hooks
into everything.
Just need you to sign it
so I can file.
And when I say everything
in the State of Nevada,
I'm talking about
the gaming industry.
That is the summit from which
everything else flows forth.
Now, my job is simple.
I keep 'em talking,
I keep 'em happy.
This guy, Fenton,
uh, he was a crusader.
So you tried to buy him off?
- Multiple times.
- And he wasn't biting?
Not even a nibble.
But when they clipped Fenton,
walls came crumbling down.
He recorded everything
I said with him
and he used that as leverage
to get me to roll.
Teddy, you're about
to perjure yourself
with people that will butcher
your entire fucking bloodline!
If you don't come clean,
I can't help you.
The feds offered me a deal.
I took the deal.
What kind of deal?
Reciprocal.
I'm invisible,
that's what I'm gonna be.
Get people to turn.
What do you mean what the fuck
I'm talking about? I got...
High-level, people with
their hands in the mix.
Listen to me, don't bust
my balls on this, alright?
And then one night
I almost got accidented.
What does that mean?
They almost blew me
the fuck up.
So I had to go to ground,
disappear.
Why don't you tell her
about the money, Teddy?
I haven't heard you
mention the money once.
- What money?
- Go on, Teddy.
Now that we're all sharing,
tell her about the millions
you siphoned off
and stashed away somewhere.
- The feds knew about the money.
- Bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.
- Lady.
This guy will roll
in your fucking guts,
given the opportunity.
I'll take my chances.
Hard chargers get charged hard.
- What does that mean?
- But you know...
It means,
if you push through much,
then you get pushed back hard.
That... that doesn't sound
as cool.
But it's meant to be helpful?
What the
fuck d'you think I said it for?
Okay. Well, alright.
Thank you. Thank you.
Alright. Take me through
the last 24 hours.
The gunshot wound,
the Crown Vic,
etcetera, all of it.
A pair of Vegas' finest
drove me out of town
to quote, "Deliver me
to the FBI," unquote.
It was bullshit.
These cops were bent.
I had a date
with a hole in the desert.
Thank God
the feds were shadowing me
or I'd have been
totally fucked.
Drop your weapons!
- Hey, hey.
- Goddammit!
Where is he?
God!
- Over there!
- Motherfuck...
I don't know!
- Stop him!
- Ah!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Teddy Murretto does not die,
motherfucker!
This is Young
down in Holding.
- Kim, you around?
- Right here, sugar.
Are Barnes and Ruby
still off-site?
Uh, they're on their way back
with the tow truck.
Alright, have the tow truck
continue on here,
but ask Barnes and Ruby
if they can reroute
to the old Nomad Motel
out on Route 95,
just north of Lee Canyon.
Possible crime scene,
multiple shooting victims.
But there hasn't been
a call-out.
I know. Just have them radio
once they're on scene.
It's gonna be alright, sarge.
We're gonna take care
of everything.
How are you feeling, sarge?
Alright.
He good?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's still breathing.
Is that ambulance
coming from Reno?
It's, they're fucking taking
forever.
I'll ask Kimble
to call them again.
- Don't let him fall asleep.
- I got it.
6 Charles, 12, this is Central.
- It's Barnes.
- Barnes, give me one second.
I've Young coming up right now.
- Kim.
- I got Barnes at the motel.
Alright. I need you to find
that ambo for me, please.
- Got it.
- Barnes.
Yeah, Young, what are we
supposed to be seeing out here?
Any signs of a shoot-out,
um, shell casings,
blood spatter, drag marks?
We need update
on that ambulance, please.
- No, nothing.
- Alright. Thanks.
About ten minutes
on that ambulance.
Bad accident on the
15 Southbound backed up traffic.
Okay. Can you do me a favor
and run a name for me?
Bob or Robert Viddick.
Try spelling variations
on that last name.
Who is he?
I think he might be
our John Doe downstairs.
Have his scans
come back from my office?
No, not yet.
Huber already asked.
- About what?
- The prints, John Doe.
Why the fuck is Huber
asking about that?
May I ask you
a personal question, Teddy?
I don't see why not.
You had it all.
You know, they took good care
of you, didn't they?
Money, women, whatever.
Why in the hell
would you give that up?
You know,
you could've kept going.
You know, they would've
never let you go down.
You'd never see the inside
of a courtroom or that cell.
You should've just kept going.
I don't do should've,
would've, could've.
Nah, you just light your
entire fucking life on fire,
run as fast as you can, hoping
that'll put out the flames.
You know what you've never been?
- Not once?
- Tell me, Teddy.
You've never been forced down
the fucking rabbit hole
making life-and-death
decisions, Bob.
I do that every fucking day.
- Teddy.
- No, you don't.
Those aren't decisions.
Those are directives.
Kill this guy, kill that guy.
Wipe out that family,
fucking vanish another one.
You're a psychopath, Bob,
plain and simple.
I'm not a psychopath, Teddy.
I'm a professional.
And there's a difference.
You'll know it when you see it.
What about
this other guy, Viddick?
I'm not familiar
with him.
Probably a cutout. Notched.
Mob mostly contracts
third-party participants
for heavy lifting like this.
These are distinctly
bad people, officer.
So the quicker we can get
Murretto moved, the better.
We found the bodies of
his ex-wife and son last night
floating in a runoff slough
near Lake Mead.
- Shit.
- Listen.
Teddy Murretto
has made more enemies
than I can count.
So, what did he tell you about
this little daring escape
he pulled off?
That a pair of crooked
cops got ambushed by the feds
and touched off a big gun fight.
Have you turned up
anything on that?
No.
Not a thing.
Thank you.
That's it.
Yeah. Alright.
Yeah.
We got a big fucking problem.
We got a cop in Gun Creek asking
too many fucking questions.
My kid okay?
You get in contact with my ex?
I talked to a detective
at Vegas PD,
and they're gonna send a car
and do wellness check.
I'm sure everything's fine.
Let me check my cell phone.
You can't check your cell phone,
Teddy.
- Let me check it.
- I'm sorry.
She's got information
from me that,
that could put her in danger,
okay?
When Vegas PD reaches back out,
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.
Robert K. Viddick.
All known associates.
What do we have here?
Well, don't these guys look like
a bunch of fucking assholes?
Anthony Lamb.
What kind of jerk-off name
is that?
Manslaughter, assault
with deadly weapon, battery.
Uh...
I have a birthday balloon
bouquet for Officer Huber.
You look just like
this fucking ass-bag down here.
Oh, come on now.
You're kidding.
No, you got to check this out.
- Look at this.
- What?
You look just like him.
The resemblance
is fucking uncanny.
Now, what are the odds?
Uh-oh. Hold on, everybody.
Hold steady now.
Ooh, the boats are rocking.
Oh, I'd love to know
what's going through your mind.
Sorry, guy, traffic was a bitch.
What do we got?
Thank God you're here.
He took quite a spill.
He's right back here.
- Holy shit.
- Check vitals.
- He got no pulse.
- You say, um, you say he fell?
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, to clarify,
I shot him in the head
and then he took
that little tumble.
Ooh. Dang.
What?
Are you...
Is that your blood
right on my head
brushed out you in your head?
Imagine that.
Anthony Jay Lamb,
you got to buy yourself
a lottery ticket today.
Ooh, I hope
they're powerballin'.
Kimble, where the fuck's
that ambo, man?
Oh, shit!
What the fuck?
Hey, who the fuck are you?
Hey, oh, hang on.
I called for help.
- Easy, easy.
- Goddamn!
- No. What the fuck happened?
- I'm just a balloon man.
Man, I'm calling for help,
buddy.
Goddamn, son!
Did ya...
What is the first rule
of policing, huh?
Beware of the unusual element.
And in this scenario,
I believe that it's me.
Officer, well,
officer formerly known
as... Pena.
Pena.
Get down, motherfucker!
Flat as a board. Get...
What the fuck is that?
I used to be a much better man.
The fuck was that?
Oh, shit now.
Hold off.
Well, that fucking blew.
How bad is it?
You happen to hear
all that gunfire?
Are you a fucking idiot, Teddy?
That question persists.
I hate talking
about the gunfire.
Fuck me.
Fuck.
You got to be
fucking shitting me.
The guy
was firing what looked like
a snub-barreled submachine gun.
Those use nine millimeter ammo.
This bullet in my stomach
is a .44 caliber.
Rico.
- What does that mean?
- Ricochet.
It means she shot herself.
It means I fucking shot myself.
Young, it's me.
Come let me out
of this cell, okay?
You don't know what's going on
up there and you're wounded bad.
You're gonna bleed out.
Young, you know me.
This is Young,
I'm trapped down here
in Holding with two detainees,
and I've been shot
in the abdomen.
Pena and Kimble
have been killed.
Be aware, we have
an armed assailant on sight.
He is outside the cell block
at present. Over.
Damn!
Young, you don't have
much time. You're bleeding out.
Get me out of this.
Come on, I can help you.
You have no idea
what's going on up there,
you are bleeding badly.
Get me the fuck out of here.
Oh, jeez.
Ah! Damn.
Now, that does appear to be
bulletproof.
Goddamn, whoa.
Anthony Lamb.
Is that big bad Bob Viddick?
Sideshow Bob, what the fuck
are you doing in there?
You know this whack job?
Yeah. He's a... Tsk.
Uh, Miss Law And Order,
how about you open this door,
we wrap this up real quick
and I get the hell out
your head? Too sweet, huh?
Theodore Murretto.
I'll be a fucking monkey's
uncle. Look at you in there.
One of male grooming's
greatest misfires, the man bun.
You look like old Tom Cruise
in that Samurai picture
that nobody watched.
Goddamn!
Bob, what's happening in there?
Uh, yeah, hey, Anthony.
You know what,
Bob, I'm sorry,
I'm going by the more friendly
and less formal Tony
these days.
I know it's been a minute.
Hey, Anthony, I'm gonna need you
to clear off this contract.
No, no, can't do, Bob,
this contract is free fire
as there are competing parties
for one Theodore Murretto.
- Hey, Anthony.
- You know...
I'm not responding to that name.
- Anthony.
- Yeah.
I'm not responding to that
fucking name, Bob, you heard me.
Doesn't, uh,
Joe Totino in Chicago
have a $65,000 stick
around your head?
Uh, he does indeed, Bob.
And all he's gotten back
are the heads of the assholes
he sent to collect mine.
Clear off my contract now,
Anthony,
or as God is my witness,
I'm gonna cut off
your fucking head,
put it in a bag
and drive it to Chicago,
I shit you not.
Meow.
Is that a gauntlet
you're throwing down there, Bob?
Are we gonna duel to the death?
Well, if so, I foresee
some terrible things for you
in the not-too-distant
future, Bob.
I drew you a dick.
It just got weird.
Well, it's gonna get weirder.
You like this accent, Murretto?
Murretto...
I'm coming in there
whether you like it or not.
Meow...
Now you see
the difference?
That is a psychopath.
10-13,
this is Officer Valerie Young.
I am gravely wounded
in the subfloor detention block
at the Gun Creek City Police
headquarters. Copy.
Can anyone hear me?
10-13, officer
in dire medical need. Over.
Fuck!
You're gonna run out of time,
Young. You're gonna die.
Teddy doesn't care
if you live or die.
- Right. And you do. Trust me.
- Don't listen to him.
- I don't care what...
- Let me help you.
- Don't fucking...
- Both of you, shut the fuck up!
God, no...
Fuck.
Valerie?
Valerie?
Are you there?
- It's Huber.
- Huber.
You've got an armed man
out there. Watch your back.
I'm shot.
Both detainees are secure.
Suspect fled the scene.
It's over.
Passcode ain't working.
Did you change it?
- Yeah.
- Well, tell me what it is.
So I can get in there
and help you.
Where's Mitchell?
They're all dead,
Valerie.
I'm sorry.
Son of a bitch murdered
every last man.
Where are you shot?
Didn't you hear my call-out
earlier?
No. I, I wasn't near my radio.
Valerie!
Huber...
why were you interested
in those IAFIS scans?
What's that?
Kimble said you asked about
the IAFIS scans for our DUI.
Yeah. You know why?
I just had a really bad feeling
about that guy.
Which guy?
Viddick, the DUI.
He was processed as John Doe.
Where did you get
the name Viddick?
Where's the man who killed
your fellow officers, Huber?
Is he whispering in your ear?
They don't care about us.
All we have to do is stand down
and give 'em Murretto.
We've already lost three cops.
I can't even think about
losing another one, okay?
You're a piece of shit,
Huber, and a horrible cop.
I never liked you,
and sarge couldn't stand you.
Well,
you... you know what, Valerie,
sarge doesn't have to worry
about me anymore,
and you're not gonna have
to worry either
if you keep up
this Alamo bullshit.
You already got a bullet
in your belly, hon.
You want another one
in your brain?
I'd like you to try,
motherfucker.
I'd like you to get on in here
and get that bullet there.
- You wanna do that for me?
- Oh, yeah, we are.
We're gonna come in there,
you stupid fucking bitch!
You hear me?
We're getting in there!
Well, Teddy's dead.
♪ That's what I said ow ♪

Actually,
he's got a pretty nice voice.
Alright. This is it.
Can we access it
through these ducts?
It's 12 inches in
diameter, it's way too narrow.
How about
we break down that door?
No.
Uh, uh...
This thing is like
a side of a fucking tank,
it's an armory-style door,
never get in.
That's why I think we bust in
through this wall, come in
through the locker room. This
is Murretto's cell right here.
I mean, it's a thick
son of a bitch.
Probably it's a foot
of solid concrete.
Well...
we bang some rock.
What do you think
they're doing out there?
Finding a way in.
And when they do get in,
they'll kill you first.
I'm gonna tell you
to barter with them, but Lamb
will just lie, then strip
the skin off your bones
once you give him what he wants.
All you had to do
was just let me blow Murretto's
head off when I had the chance.
Then you wouldn't be sitting
there with a bullet in your side
praying for a fucking miracle.
Bullets before prayers.
Is that a poem?
Bullets before prayers.
My great-grandfather
had that scrawled
on his Stahlhelm helmet
in World War II.
Stahlhelm?
Wasn't that
a German army helmet?
Your great-grandfather
was a Nazi?
But you're...
- Black?
- Black.
Nazis were
in North Africa in the 1940s,
just a little trivia
to take from the circumstance.
Like most Germans at the time,
he had to fight.
They were being overrun,
he didn't have a choice.
Yeah, deja vu.
Wait, what?
Deja vu.
That's not deja vu, dummy.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
Deja vu is when you experience
the exact same thing
a second time.
Or the sensation that you have.
Why are you taking his side?
How the fuck
am I taking his side?
You said that your
great-grandfather had to fight,
that he was overrun
and he had no choice,
like me, sitting right here.
Deja vu.
Okay, whatever. You win.
Anybody else
feel cold?
Hey, look at me, Young.
Don't close your eyes.
Throw me the keys.
Throw me the keys.
You're better off
bleeding to death sitting there.
Do not give him the keys.
You're gonna listen
to that contract killer
or are you gonna listen to me?
Are you fucking kidding?
He's a mob flunky conman.
Who would you rather have
fighting
for your life right now, Val?
Not you.
Never you.
Why, because I'm the bad guy?
Shit.
Here they come.
Hey, asshole,
you're gonna help me
or you're just gonna sit there
eating that shit?
We just got
but the one hammer there, Hoss.
Yeah, I get that,
but I... I thought
that maybe we could switch,
you know, trade off.
Oh, come on, man, I already
killed four people tonight,
including two of your coworkers.
I am bushed.
I killed
my fucking sergeant tonight
and an innocent civilian.
Yup, well...
You're in the cop business,
so that makes you a murderer.
But I'm in the murder business,
so that just makes me a laborer.
- You see how that works?
- You're fucking crazy.
And also, on top of it,
not to beat a dead horse,
but you could use
some physical activity.
- Motherfucker.
- Oh, come on, man.
I can't imagine
your wife likes you
sliding all up on top of her
looking like
a big old Hot Pocket
with a hard-on.
I mean, lookit, don't you wanna
look like that one time?
Fucking Chris Hemsworth
enjoys a beach day
with his wife Elsa Pataky.
Just one time in your life
don't you wanna look like Thor?
Of course you do.
It's only gonna happen
with hard work
and a swinging
to the mighty hammer.
So carry on, my Norseman.
Come on, Thor!
I think we're out of prayers,
Young.
I don't wanna see you bleed out
and I, I don't wanna see anybody
take the skin off your bones.
I just wanna
get the fuck out of here.
Young, you wanna see
a way through this?
Don't listen to him.
Throw me the fucking keys.
Think he's gonna make it through
these guys?
And if he does,
you think you're gonna
see him again?
Oh, you gotta be
fucking kidding me.
All that blood loss
has made you loopy, lady.
I don't wanna die in here
if I can help it.
But I'm trusting you, Teddy,
to do as you say and help me
and not run from this.
All Teddy does is run.
He's running from me,
he ran to you.
How do you think he got in here?
He sucker-punched a cop, you!
- I got that last week.
- Fuck.
- I want it back.
- Oh, you just fucked us both.
In the kitchen,
next to the in-take lobby,
there's a trauma kit
above the fridge.
He's a fucking
opportunist, that's all he is.
Please bring that back here.
I won't make it otherwise,
Teddy.
Ask Officer Young where
your ex-wife and son are, Teddy.
You said you sent out a unit
to check on them.
Did that unit ever arrive,
Officer Young?
Are Teddy's family
all wrapped away safe and sound?
Young...
where are they?
I'm sorry, Teddy.
What?
I'm sorry.
Did you know
my family was dead, Viddick?
You couldn't have saved them
anyway, Teddy.
You doomed 'em a long time ago.
Did you kill my family, Bob?
I didn't.
Lamb have something
to do with it?
- I can't be sure.
- Best guess.
Where were they found?
In a runoff slough,
near Lake Mead.
Yeah, it was him.
That top cap was a butt-naked
tranny with a mask on.
You can't say,
you can't say tranny.
- You have to say transvestite.
- That's your call?
Now you have to say
transvestite, it's just like...
Fuck that. Hey,
where the fuck is everybody?
They're still doing construction
this late?
They shouldn't be.
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck happened here?
Oh, man...
This fucking thing's
taking forever.
Huber, what the fuck?
Hey, you guys. You're back.
Where... Why are you back?
- We ran out to a scene for Val.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Who's this?
- Why is he at the...
- No, no, wait, ho... hold on.
- Ah...
Huber, Huber,
I don't know nothing.
I didn't see nothing, man.
- I got kids.
- He's not gonna say anything.
Tell him you're not gonna
say anything.
I swear to fucking Christ,
I'll never say anything.
- Are you sure?
- Uh...
You can trust him,
he's my friend.
- Oh, you all friends?
- Yeah.
Yeah, then you shoot him.
- All friendly-like.
- What?
- I can't. Not, not Barnes.
- You shot your sergeant.
This man means something to me.
I'm gonna walk over there
and empty
the contents of this weapon
into his face.
So if you plan to be
more humane,
now is the fucking time!
No, Huber, Huber, come on, man.
I'm shot and wounded.
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry, Barnes.
- Look at me, dude, look at me.
- You were right.
You know my kids, man.
I promised them I'd be home.
- Just close your eyes, man.
- I promised.
Please tell me
your grand plan was not
freeing a fucking idiot,
putting a gun in his hand.
What choice did I have?
Freeing and arming me.
You're a hired killer.
I wish you knew
what I knew about him.
But you were so hell-bent
on saving the day,
that you wound up
shooting yourself.
I won't live in a world where
people like you win, Viddick.
Right.
You'll just safeguard
a lying asshole
and give your life
to protect his.
Should I look like you, Bob?
It's honest.
It's lawless.
And I won't stand for it.
No, you'll just sit there
and bleed out instead.
Come on, give me the keys.
Give me the keys, Valerie.
No.
And don't call me Valerie.
It's creepy.
What the fuck?
How did you do that, Bob?
Oh, let's put a pin in that
right now, Val.
I just wanted to see how our
little friendship
would play out.
Now pretty soon
you're gonna lose consciousness,
you're gonna fall asleep,
and you're not gonna wake up.
Then will you listen
to my dying wish before I do?
You have someone you love?
- Don't we all?
- No, we don't, but you do.
No, that's
your left hand, your gun hand.
You're not gonna
wear a ring there.
You're married.
You wanna see him again?
Teddy's not coming back.
You can trust me on that.
You said you wanted to take
your chances, here they are.
You either sit there
and bleed out
or give me the goddamn keys.
Ooh, now Teddy dead,
motherfucker.
♪ Ooh that's what I said ♪
♪ Now the motherfuckin'
Teddy's dead ♪
♪ Oh ♪♪
Teddy!
You, you shot me.
Teddy,
you could've stopped
this whole goddamn mess, man,
and saved your family, too.
Lookit, all they wanted
was those names.
And, well,
and all the money you stole,
you thieving little
motherfucker.
Ah, you're shootin' at shadows,
Mr. Teddy.
Yeah, you better
conserve that ammo.
♪ You're gonna need it ♪♪
Remember, Teddy's dead.
Fuck.
- Officer Huber.
- Listen, I...
No, no!
I sedated 'em, Teddy.
They were sound asleep when
I put the Ziplocs over 'em.
It didn't take for two minutes.
I didn't want them to suffer.
They didn't fuck up, Teddy.
You did.
You... you were the fuck-up
of the family.
And then I laid them
in the water.
We all deserve the water
in the end,
no matter what we've done.
It's fucking Huber.
What?
No...
No...
- Ah!
- Ah...
Anthony.
Hey, man, Bob.
Alright, now it hurts.
I'm think we're gonna need
something just a little bit
bigger, Anthony,
cut off your head.
That's your reaction?
Fuck.
Mother... Motherfuck...
Motherfucker!
Parlay.
What?
Pirate code.
A temporary ceasefire
to achieve a common end,
as in this end.
Our little lost Lamb
isn't dead just yet.
So I'm gonna let you
send him off.
Revenge for your family.
Then you and I
are gonna resume...
Oh, man!
Motherfucker!
The water.
The water...
Not bad, is it?
That's jackfruit.
It's not chicken.
I mixed some garlic and cilantro
with store-bought coleslaw.
That's the secret.
- Val.
- Teddy.
- You never came back.
- I was coming back, Val.
I was grabbing this kit right
here and I was coming back.
Oh.
So you were gonna bring it
after you ate,
but before you lit this place
on fire?
And where's my gun?
Am I gonna get that back?
That's okay.
I got my friend's gun.
My dead friend.
I heard
that machine gun of yours
making quite the statement.
So, have you seen Huber?
Lamb?
Viddick?
There it is.
My own bullet that I put
in my stomach protecting you.
Viddick was right about you.
But...
we are what we are...
always.
You seem to always have
so much to say. Nothing new now?
I was just wondering
where all this is going.
Yeah.
Me, too.
I'll guess we'll find out soon.
I radioed in a Code 3,
also known as a Hot Call, so...
We're ten minutes away from
our parking lot being flooded
with every available
law-enforcement officer
within a 20-mile radius.
And I just took
an adrenaline shot.
So I'm feeling
a little rambunctious.
Shame.
You can run.
So you could shoot me
in the back?
You've already stabbed me
in mine.
I think we should get you back
to your cell now, Teddy.
Unless you had something else
in mind.
Thank you, sarge.
Ah!
Thanks, Pena.
Never more than a day
ahead of the devil, Teddy.
Or maybe I'm your devil now.
And this is our day.
You can't run from this.
Hell's already here.
Yo, Val, I'm just sitting here
wondering...
where things went wrong
between us.
We were
up to such a good start.
Val, Val, Val. Wait, wait.
Give me ten seconds.
Give me ten seconds of your
time. Just give me ten seconds.
I'm sorry, officer.
Fuck...
Good for you.
You didn't beat me, Bob.
What's in the bag, Bob?
Go home, Val.
She with you? Schier?
What does it matter?
You made it.
Let this go, Val.
Just let it go.
Yeah. There you go.
Come on.
Valerie...
Forget it.
Hey, it's Viddick.
All good. Murretto's burned.
Yeah, shit. Easy breezy.
Oh, by the way, I want you to
call that Joe Totino in Chicago.
Tell him I'm bringing him
a beautiful piece of Lamb.
All units be
advised,
we have an unidentified
white male suspect
in a stolen police cruiser,
last seen exiting...
What was that, officer?
Heading
southbound on I-15.
I'm gonna need you to pull
this fucking ambulance over.
Right now.
All units
be advised.
Pullover, pullover,
a white male suspect
identified as Robert K. Viddick,
Robert K. Viddick.
Last seen exiting
the Gun Creek police station.
He's in possession of
a stolen unmarked police car.
Text babe. Hey, baby.
I'm putting in
a couple of hours overtime.
See you later. I love you.
