Hurry up and finish!
I made you wait.
We're printing the calendar
for the Imperial Palace,
and we're a bit behind on everything else.
It's a large order...
we're responsible for all the copies
for the Western region.
You are very late!
I've brought 300.
Bring 500 by tonight,
or you'll only get 1/2 your pay.
Will you please choose from here.
My Master would prefer something
more classical.
He told me Mohei, your Second in Command,
could do it. Is he here?
An order from Master Kozé.
Ask Mohei to wake up.
To specially print the calendar
for each Family...
That's like a tree
bearing golden fruit.
Nowadays,
business is disasterous.
But this house is rolling in gold.
The owner is very hard to please
and just as particular.
Better to ask how he does it 
with employees whom he pays hardly anything!
Mr. Mohei! An order
for Master Kozé.
If they're looking for the sample
with the golden broche, listen up...
look in the second cupboard.
You're the only one who can tell
them apart.
Please wake up.
How tiresome!
O-San!
Doki!
Why are you coming in from this way?
- Is your husband here?
- No, he went out.
I've got a big favor to ask of you.
Could you, if you please,
lend me 1/2 kan of gold?
Why such a large amount?
Is it to once again pay your debts
to courtesans?
No, it's to pay the interest
on the mortgage over our family home.
Our ancestral residence?
Yes. My loans to the courtesans
haven't yet been returned...
so to pay I've used...
one sum entrusted by another.
I'm begging you!
I've already found enough to pay
1/3 of the amount. I'm missing the rest.
If I don't have it all in 3 days,
I'll be arrested.
But you're crazy to have acted like this!
Madam your mother is here.
Don't tell her you've seen me!
I'll come back tomorrow.
I'm bringing Mr. Mohei his broth.
Answer if Madam calls.
O-Tama cares for Mohei
as if he were her husband!
I'd like to know what he thinks of her.
Then go ask Mr. Mohei!
Here is your wheat broth.
Thank you very much.
You mustn't get out of bed.
The work can't wait.
I will not be able to care for you
while Madam's mother is here.
Mrs. Gifuya ?
O-Tama, so what is happening 
within the Gifuya family?
I don't know of anything.
You should eat.
It will get cold.
I'll come back a little later.
Oh, what a minx!
Of course, your brother
is not very clever.
And after your father's death,
we've tended to scorn him.
I've scolded him...
but if he's arrested for unpaid debts,
our family will be dishonored.
This shame must be avoided 
at all costs.
Rumors spread just as quickly
in business...
It embarrasses me, but could you
once again beg your husband...
to help us avoid the worst?
I will ask him...
but it fills me with shame...
we've counted on him so much
since our engagement...
and our marriage.
The Master!
Welcome, Master.
The work for the Minister
will be finished by this evening?
No, Master. Mohei
is in bed, ill.
He must get up!
I promised to have it delivered tomorrow.
Did you spend the evening
with the Minister?
These nobles deign to drink with us
only when we pay.
Where is Madam..?
She is receiving the Lady her Mother.
My head-rest.
So then... did you think about it?
Master... don't touch me!
Look here O-Tama...
think of your own benefit.
I'm offering a lavish life,
to you, an orphan with no family!
I prefer to remain as I am.
But I do not prefer that!
The truth is...
I am engaged.
What...?
Do not speak lies!
It's no lie.
Who is it...?
Don't make up stories.
Who is it?
Mr. Mohei...
Don't come to my room anymore,
take pity!
I'll come whenever I please,
until you agree.
Forgive me for not having 
been able to welcome you.
I'm exhausted!
I had to stay with the Minister
all night long.
What did your mother want?
If it's a question of money, I refuse!
She came to see the neighbours.
Speaking of which, Sukeimon told me you
promised a price for my older sister.
Your sister asked for it.
Even for my sister, I refuse!
Mr. Mohei! Are you feeling better?
Much better. All ready for work.
Really...?
Where did you learn that's the one?
I picked it up from watching...
Do you intend to...
marry a printer?
Of course.
What's wrong then?
I regret it, but...
if the Master speaks to you about me...
would you help me by assuirng him...
that we are engaged?
How can I...
He's pursuing me so much...
that I couldn't give him
any other pretext.
The Master?
I can help you with something else,
but I don't want to lie.
I am bound by a contract
and cannot leave.
Of course not.
Would you rather I gave in
to the Master?
Definitely not!
Maybe I should alert Madam?
That wouldn't do.
It would be a disaster.
Primarily...
Madam would suffer.
In any event, you have to keep 
in mind this family's honor.
Keep all this a secret,
don't drag anyone into it.
That's a servant's duty.
Don't forget that you're an employee here.
Do you completely understand me?
Come and see! Some adulterous lovers
are being crucified!
The wife and servant of a
Samurai were both to blame!
A Samurai's wife
and his servant?
Make way!
They will both be crucified and 
revealed before the eyes of the public.
Shame will befall them
and their families!
How dreadful women are!
If a Samurai does not punish
the adulterer himself,
he loses his rank and title.
Better to die by the hand of one's husband...
than to perish so shamefully!
Mohei !
You've recovered?
Thank you, Madam. I feel better.
Madam your mother...
Mrs. Gifuya has arrived...
is there something worrying you?
Why do you ask..?
No... everything's fine.
Men have the right to make mistakes...
but we crucify women for that.
What horrible injustice!
Watch what you say!
Why must they be crucified?
They didn't kill anyone.
They didn't steal anything.
It's true. How saddening!
Don't you feel sorry for them?
Of course I do. But no one must
break the law.
That's why we're punishing them...
I brought you a warm drink.
Some brandy in eggnog.
Thank you very much!
Is it ready?
Yes... I managed to finish it.
This night of work ought to have killed you.
I will take this to the Master.
I'm accompanying him to the Minister's house.
I will take it to him.
Keep an eye on the work. Make sure all
the calendars are done by tonight.
You're looking for me?
Yesterday, you asked about
our family.
As a result,
I have a favor to ask of you.
Can you stop by my room?
I am ashamed to reveal such
a humiliation.
It's nothing.
Your brother is going through 
the troubles of every businessman.
How much does he need?
He needs another 1/2 kan of gold...
I thought he would need
50 or 100 !
You speak kind words...
but I didn't dare to speak to
my husband. Since our marriage,
we have already borrowed heavily 
from him.
I know, Madam.
It is I who take care of the accounts.
I will resolve this problem.
This does not bother you?
No! Don't worry yourself.
It is simply another way to serve 
the family of my Master.
I will easily find this sum.
I knew I could count on you.
But I did not expect this much.
Thank you so much, thank you!
The Minister is very pleased with your work.
I am very happy to hear so, Master.
You're feeling better...?
Don't tire yourself too much.
Thank you, Master.
You are the only one who capable of 
accomplishing such delicate work.
Here are the calendars 
for the Imperial Palace.
I have to sign a receipt for an order. 
Can you please give me your seal?
Here. Take it.
What are you doing?
You're back..!
- You're loooking very cheerful!
- What do you mean by that?
I was signing a receipt.
But, this seal
on a blank page..?
I need to take out an emergency
loan of 1/2 kan of gold.
I'm sure I'll be able to return 
this amount.
Turn a blind eye for 3 weeks, ok?
Why do you need this amount?
You and I...
we have often acted in this manner, 
for much larger and more important amounts.
Maybe. But explain it to me.
We never put a seal 
on a blank page!
If I could have told you,
I would have run it by you before doing it.
Fine! Then, add another half of that
for me.
Sukeimon! lmpossible! I'll get that to
you some other way.
Mohei! What you are doing is
very dangerous.
You can be accused of fraud.
Think about that!
Even if you are the Master's and 
Madam's favorite.
I see.
I was wrong.
I am going to apologize before
the Master.
Do as I tell you...
Look, Mohei !
What is the meaning of this..?
It is but 1/2 kan of gold...
What?? "But 1/2 kan of gold" ?
Be it a great or insignificant sum,
it is "my" money!
How could you dare?
Explain yourself.
It is a sum that I 
absolutely require.
Can I accept your excuses 
when you are so stubborn?
Your apprenticeship,
who do you owe it to?
Have you forgotten that?
You want to buy out a geisha?
I have never gone to a geisha-house!
You know that!
What is going on?
He placed the Master's seal upon
a blank receipt!
If you refuse to speak,
the police will wrest the truth from you!
Listen to me, it is I...
It is I who begged him for this money!
For what purpose?
My uncle, a poor dishonored Samurai...
harassed by his creditors...
wants to commit hara-kiri.
I begged Mr. Mohei...
to lend me this amount.
You two seem to be very close!
No, that is not...
Who would do such a thing simply
for a friend?
He doubtless acted thus simply out
of pity.
I beg you to have mercy on him.
Forgive them!
No! They are lovers, it's obvious!
I am of no importance, but think of O-Tama.
One day, she will surely marry.
Sukeimon, lock him in
the storeroom.
I will hand you over to the police tomorrow.
And keep a close eye on O-Tama as well!
I'm going out... I while be a while.
O-Tama and Mohei
could not have done something like this!
Quiet! This doesn't concern you in the least!
Go on, all of you....back to work!
You should have done as I told you!
What are you going to do now
after having been treated so harshly?
When we know that even in this day and age,
the Master takes part of our money
to enjoy the slightest petty sin.
And you fall into his trap!
Keep a close eye on him!
The Madam sent you this.
The Madam?
Thank you very much.
Madam!
My humble room is not fit 
for your ladyship.
I came to thank you.
I am responsible for everything. Forgive me.
Responsible...?
You mean you don't know?
So then, you do love Mohei?
I will ask the Master to pardon 
you both.
He will never forgive me!
Why not?
I do not wish to upset you,
Madam...
and I'd like to continue keeping silent...
To tell you the truth...
the Master...
torments me ceaselessly and 
wants to buy me a house...
so he can take advantage of me.
To spare myself, I told him...
that I am engaged to Mohei.
Therefore, out of anger, the Master...
I am certain that, to avenge himself,
he will come here tonight.
To your room?
You are positive?
Yes, Madam.
He has already done so many times...
And he dares to blame others!
As for him,
he is of an absolutely sordid greed.
Yet he is ready to buy you a home?
"Are we born in order to work...?"
What, not awake yet?
Watch the fire!
O-Tama ! It's me, Mohei.
You are good to have spared 
the Madam.
Don't say anything!
I am leaving this house for good.
But I wanted to thank you.
Madam...! What are you doing here?
O-Tama had to go speak to you...
I want to be here to surprise my husband,
to have a serious talk with him...
and to save you, as well as O-Tama.
O-Tama told you...?
You wish to leave us?
Once I am handed over to the police,
I will no longer be able to find
the money for your family.
I will borrow this money and bring 
it to you.
You are still thinking about that!
I want to make up for my blunder.
I will ask my husband to be lenient.
I know the Master well!
He will never forgive me.
I'm leaving...
But how can I let you leave...
when it is I who is the the cause
of your misfortune?
What guards!...Get up, fools!
Sir, sir!
Madam, Madam...wake up!
Mohei has escaped!
Wake up, Madam!
O-Tama!
What are you doing here?
No, don't go!
I am begging you, Madam.
Go back to the storeroom and 
wait there patiently.
Say no more.
So then, you've come to finish off
the evening with me, my little ones?
Master, it's terrible!
Come quick!
What is it now?
Believe me, I beg you.
I swear to you that I am not lying.
I do not believe you.
First off, what were you doing 
in a servant's room?
O-Tama's room?
I wanted to surprise you.
And you would have been obligated 
to listen to me.
You could have told me right here.
You wanted to sleep with him, right?
You refuse to believe me
despite my explanations.
O-San!
You know what someone of your rank must do...?
- It's impossible to find him.
- Did you search well?
Yes Master. Absolutely everywhere.
And you found nothing, any of you?
What should I do?
Make sure everyone keeps 
absolutely secret
about what has happened here this evening.
But how do we shut 
up the fugitive?
Go to the police and file a complaint
for theft of my seal.
I had a feeling he was conspiring
about something,
but I never would have thought
it was for the Madam!
Say that it was without a doubt him!
How they were dressed!
Shut up!
Go to the police station! Quick!
What are you doing lagging behind?
Get going!
Madam!
What are you doing here?
I no longer want to remain 
in this house.
I am his wife. He should be 
honest with me, and listen to me.
But I've finally discovered
what sort of man he really is.
Like a fool, I sat there 
completely ignorant.
Madam...
his accusation of adultery came
from a misunderstanding.
He passed judgment too hastily,
he's so impulsive!
For this evening, go to your
Mother's house.
I will take you there.
Never! I don't want to go
to my Mother's!
I beg you...I want to take
myself far away from here.
What...?
And yourself? Where are you thinking
of going?
I want to head off to Osaka.
I am lacking the money for your brother.
At Osaka, I have friends...
Take me with you.
lmpossible, Madam! Then we will surely
be judged as lovers.
We'll be crucified!
I understand...
You go then...!
I will take care of myself.
Don't say that, you make my leaving
much too difficult.
So then, what should I do?
Madam... listen...
Does the ship bound for Osaka leave from here?
Yes, Madam.
This is the first time I have ever
spent a night in an inn.
How cold it is!
Excuse me please.
I've brought some hot water.
Shall I prepare your bed?
And your flu?
My flu, Madam?
My word! In all this hubbub,
it has disappeared!
What are you doing?
A single pillow will suffice.
I will not be sleeping here.
Warm the room up well.
You aren't sleeping together...?
Please forgive me.
I must have been confused.
Good night.
Mohei, I'm frightened. Stay here with me.
Not in the same room as yourself, Madam.
Please, go to sleep, I won't keep
you any longer.
How very strange are the varying
types of people!
Such a radical change in
a single day!
There's no one at fault...Let's
think about tomorrow when tomorrow comes.
Forget everything and sleep.
I will go to sleep as well.
Good night.
The Master is harassing his managers
regarding their accounts.
But he expends great sums on those
who order the calendar.
Such an expense is but a drop of water
compared to the ocean of its payoff!
If he's so rich, it's because he
monopolises the sale of calendars.
And if he doesn't find cause to celebrate that,
Fortune will make him grow old before his time.
Today must be the best day of the year
for this Family!
O-Tama ! Don't be so sad!
You'll break your heart,
and to what end?
Madam and Mohei
will surely return.
Come on...have courage! Okay?
Ministers, Sir Chamberlain,
welcome to my home!
This is a rare honor for our family.
You are so very kind...
that it is a pleasure to participate
in your festivities.
The delivery of the Calendar is an
auspicious day for you.
Likewise are we so very happy to
partake in your joy.
Thank you. Sirs, you are too good to me!
Master Isan has arrived.
Good to see you,
despite your busy work.
I stopped by to congratulate you
on the joyous
publication of the latest Calendar.
Thank you very much.
This is the printer of parchments for the
ex-Emperor. Isan is his name.
I will be very obliged if 
you would reserve...
the same compliments for him, as those 
you shower on me.
I salute you, Sirs.
Please take a seat.
I do not see your wife...
She went to visit her mother
who is not well.
A pity! I would have been delighted
to see her lovely face...
Isan, please accept a toast.
Excuse me a moment...
Ishun's business becomes more and
more prosperous.
On the other hand, at the Palace...
his debtors are more and more unable 
to repay him.
lshun is very clever. I'd like to
be even half of what he is.
Many are the high officials
who are, financially, at his mercy.
It's been said that at Osaka, Yodoya threw
his money out the window,
and so he forced him into ruin.
Most officials breathed
a sigh of relief.
Our Great Printer, he does not
risk anything.
Absolutely!
She is not at her mother's place.
She must have run away with him.
Send men down every road.
If they find them, tell them to 
bring back O-San alone.
And if the Police arrest them first...?
They won't admit to the adultery...
in fear of crucifixion.
Once surrounded, they'll be capable
of anything.
That's why it must be done quickly.
Sir, this room is not fit 
for receiving you.
Please do me a favor.
Purchase this from me for 8 kan.
It's a Teika,
you'll be able to sell it easily.
I need some money right away.
So then, is it really true...?
You have sensitive ears!
Unless you don't act fast enough...
this house will be condemned.
But a simple merchant can weasle
himself out without trouble.
With the help of the Palace,
he can become the equal of a Samurai.
You really think it'll end like that?
He hasn't informed the Police?
He wouldn't dare.
The Master above all 
cares for his reputation!
His house will collapse,
if we arrest the two
guilty ones together.
Listen closely!
If this House is condemned...
it is I who will become the
Great Printer.
Now, at this moment...
my current position remains
without a successor.
You wouldn't be interested?
I will become the
Printer of Parchments...?
In your stead?
You won't have to remain an
employee your whole life.
Know you will win this position...understand?
Thanks a million.
Here's a precious talisman.
Place it on the altar.
You sing impeccably...
that delicate melody.
I compliment you.
You possess quite a talent!
Above all...for libertinage.
- You're kidding!
- Not at all.
Thank you a thousand times over for
coming so often.
Oh, Madam...
I have fewer and fewer students.
And what's more, I'd like you to
know that with your son
I feel like I'm in paradise.
Here, it's above all hell.
And there are reasons for which
you won't come here anymore.
Hell?
What do you mean by 'hell'?
Each day, I pray to the Gods,
I deprive myself of those 
things which I love.
Your insouciance kills me!
I'm happy knowing it's pointless to
go on fighting.
You are a hardened optimist!
I don't know what more to do!
Mother, I am the head of this family, 
and I am going to be arrested.
My sister has fled with her lover.
Our residence and valuables will
be confiscated.
The fall of the the House Gifuya
is complete, isn't that right Mother?
That which Ishun, the 
Great Printer says...
I cannot believe.
O-San is incapable
of such infamy!
What are you talking about, Mother?
This drama all started
when you made her marry a man
30 years her senior.
I had to act that way
to save House Gifuya.
If O-San left, 
it's for some other reason.
If only she had killed herself!
Master!
The courier brought this package,
coming from Osaka.
Thank you!...You may go.
Mother, this came from O-San.
"In hope of saving you...
I've borrowed from an acquaintance.
I'm sending you the amount you asked for..."
It's money!...Look!
"that which you hear said about me...
please don't believe any of it.
Be good to Mother.
Your loving sister."
God be praised!
What is she doing in Osaka?
O-San!
An inspection?
Yes. What's this all about?
Pilgrims that are part of our group, 
go ahead and pass through!
It appears they're looking for the
wife of the Great Printer from Kyoto.
Not here...?
He was with a woman, right?
But they were beggars...
Still no sign...? Forger, adulterer,
these are serious charges.
We absolutely must find them!
Go on, search everywhere!
The Master went and filed a complaint.
What are we going to do?
Now it's impossible to go to Kyoto.
We'll have to head to Lake Biwa.
Once we get to the lake...
do you think we'll be able to go further?
This is the only place where 
they could have hidden!
They must return to the highway.
I would rather die than be arrested.
Madam... what are you saying?
It's definitely them!
Excuse me.
Police inspection.
What is your name?
Kyubei...and my sister Tami.
Residing at Tenma, Osaka.
Is that it?
Exactly.
Why are you here?
To visit the Hiyoshi Sanctuary.
Really...?
They responded to the signal.
I'll stay and guard them.
You go quickly back to the office.
Hurry up!
We've been discovered. Come!
We won't be able to escape!
I no longer want to be a fugitive!
I detest living a life of shame.
Mohei...let me die!
I'm begging you...
Let's leave!
Madam O-San...
are you ready?
Because of me...
you will die.
Can you ever forgive me?
What are you trying to say?
It was a great pleasure to attend to you.
I can say it now.
The heavens won't punish me if,
in the final moment of my life...
I am unable to hold back 
these last words:
I, Mohei...
I have always...
loved you with all my being.
What...?
Hold me tight...
Madam O-San...
Do you want me to...?
Forgive me!
Your confession has changed everything.
What do you say...?
I no longer wish to die...
I want to live!
Did you call for me, Master?
Come closer...
Go to Katada immediately...
and look for their cadavers.
I've just been forewarned.
It appears that they drowned themselves
in Lake Biwa.
A double suicide...?
I am asking that we guard this new secret.
If you find them...
separate O-San from Mohei.
If their bodies are found together,
that would be terrible.
Understand?
Go quickly!
It's frightening!
They killed themselves together.
Wasn't it just a false alarm?
Someone saw them jump into the
water, in each others' arms.
What is it, O-Tama?
You wanted Madam to take Mohei 
away with her?
"Madam... I am very upset"
Leave me alone!
Shut up!
Do not touch the cadavers, even if
they are intertwined...understand?
Remove them carefully just as they are...
Understand?
Do not separate them... Understand?
What a beautiful day!
You're leaving for Kyoto?
I'll spend the night in Saga,
at my married daughter's house.
I'll bring you back any good news.
Can we sit down for a little while?
For as long as you wish.
What's the matter with her?
She's hurt her leg...
while making the trip.
She's definitely sprained it.
Poor thing, the road is difficult.
I have a good remedy.
Thank you. Please give it to her!
Can we make it make it to the village
down in the valley before nightfall?
That's at the end of the road!
Come, Madam. Come and rest.
I will ask if they will
have us for the night.
The high mountain air is not good for you.
Could you please house us 
this evening?
Certainly! I will look 
for the remedy.
We're in luck!
Have just a little more courage!
I will wash your feet.
How I wish I could
redo my hair!
It upsets me to have to see you
suffer all these torments.
It is I who is indebted to you.
I can barely walk.
But I am happier than I have ever been.
I am truly so happy!
According to the Notice posted at Saga,
it is only I whom they are searching for.
Without a doubt the Master
will be more lenient towards you.
What are you talking about?
This remedy will remove all trace 
of pain in one night.
Show me your ankle.
What a lovely little foot!
So where are you going to?
To visit the Sanctuary of Kirido.
How envious I am!
Where is the gentleman?
Why are you saving yourself?
It's cruel to abandon me thus!
What can I do to gain your forgiveness
for all these misfortunes?
Go back to your husband.
He will welcome you back with joy.
I'm begging you!
Do you really believe I can go
on living without you?
You are no longer a servant...
you are my husband... my master!
Forget what I've said...
I will never leave you again...
for as long as I live!
I'd settle to be a dishonored Samurai,
I wouldn't be so pathetic as to be
maintained by my niece.
But I regret that she has caused
you so much worry...
by lying because of her ridiculous
love for Mr. Mohei.
Say your goodbyes.
Thank you for your generosity
during all these years.
You didn't blame yourself 
when you were before the Master.
All of this is your fault.
O-Tama, you will write me...?
Be happy!
I am the chestnut merchant who
comes every year.
Would you like to buy some?
Madam isn't here now. Please
come back later.
Madam is absent?
Then, it really was her!
You saw Madam?
Really...?
I caught a glimpse of her at Saga,
at the foot of Mount Atago.
Was she alone?
- With an employee of the house?
- Yes, that's it.
What a story!
And in the end, to be snubbed!
Master! They are alive,
both of them!
They aren't dead!
A woodsman saw them yesterday at
the foot of Mount Atago...
Alive?
They are surely going to Mohei's father's
house...we must chase them down!
Bring back only O-San.
Leave Mohei down there.
Let the village police deal with him.
Do you understand?
Alive...?
Who's there?
It is I...I!
Father, it's me!
I don't know you.
It's Mohei!
I don't have, for a son, a bandit being
chased down by the police.
The police have already been here?
What do you want...? Think of the neighbours.
Instead of working loyally at your job,
you are being chased like a dog
without a master.
Let's get going.
But we've walked for so long!
For travellers surprised by nightfall,
there's a cabin in the back.
You can use that!
We won't be able to find refuge 
at his place.
I believe you are right.
You must leave before dawn.
I am guessing there must be some
reason for your flight.
But do not let yourselves be
arrested before my eyes!
Here's something for you to eat...
for tonight and tomorrow.
As a child, I would come here often
and dream...
planning to go to Kyoto 
and succeeding in life.
What a beautiful dream that was!
I would be happy here...
if I could live with you,
peacefully...forever!
Genbei!
As I explained to you yesterday,
you will be arrested as an accomplice
if you are hiding Mohei.
Some people saw them on the road.
They must both be here.
Don't deny it!
Otherwise, the entire village will be
severely punished.
Will you still feign ignorance knowing
that all of you will suffer?
You are the gamekeeper of the
Great Printer.
The Master is overburdened
because of your son's actions.
Can you be as ungrateful 
towards your benefactor?
I will beg the Master to 
forgive Mohei.
If Madam is here, 
admit it frankly.
Do you not feel guilty 
of betraying your Master?
You are baser than a beast!
Forgive me, I am so sorry.
They are here then?
It's true.
Madam...
Wake up!
If she comes in,
you will surely find for her an
excellent pretext...
and everything can be 
resolved, right?
Thank you for your kindness.
Please be so kind as to consider
that she has been at her mother's house.
Understood.
In return,
please do me a small favor.
Your name has already been struck
from my registers.
Truly?
Perhaps our debts mean little
compared to your peace of mind.
Please don't overwhelm me with 
irony, Sir.
Your competitor, lsan,
is spreading evil rumors
regarding this matter.
He is saying your wife has a lover.
What treachery on his part,
he whom the Master protected for so long!
Let's not speak of it any further...
I thank you for your loyalty.
Thank you for having listened
to my modest singing.
It was splendid! Thank you.
Since you have been so kind
to my sister,
I am indebted to you for life.
As always.
But this is an important lesson:
do not marry but a loyal woman.
Please accept my cup.
Father, set me free!
I cannot even die in peace!
What do you think you'll do?
Even free, you will never be able to
live with the wife of your Master.
Stop speaking garbage!
You don't understand me.
And I'm happy that way.
Tomorrow...
The Kyoto Police 
will come looking for you.
Is that true?
What have I done against the heavens
to have a child so similar to me!
Ungrateful fool!
Be careful not to do anything shameful.
Get going. Right away!
Do not upset your mother at this moment!
You don't want to go back to your husband?
Where will you go then?
He has forgiven you, instead of
massacring you along with your lover!
If you irritate him again,
it will be the end of you!
Don't treat her so severely.
I understand you very well,
my dear.
But...
Mohei has been arrested.
I'm not telling you this because of 
your husband nor because of our House.
But it will be better if you would forget
and return to your Master.
I saw lshun and did everything
I could for you.
That's enough!
You will return to your husband.
lmmediately! Have you completely
understood?
Madam Mother...
I know that I should not
have come here.
This is not the place to discuss it.
Come into the house.
You therefore escaped?
I was giving up hope of
ever seeing you again.
No matter what happens,
I don't want to leave you again.
I will not let you leave!
It isn't much...
but here's some warm saké
to comfort you.
Please forgive this intrusion
on my part.
Listen... Mohei...
You both appear ready to 
confront any obstacle.
But your unbridled passion...
is making this an impossible situation.
You have seen one another once more...
you are happy.
But now, Mohei,
it's best you leave for Kyoto
without further delay.
Here is something for your voyage.
I don't want to let Mohei 
leave by himself!
What's that? Are you trying to ruin
our House and that of your husband?
You did not come here with
that intention, did you Mohei?
I came to find O-San.
You talk nonsense...
this is just too absurd!
Doki!
Mohei...give yourself up to 
the Police, alone.
That way everyone will be saved...
Do it for O-San !
I am begging you, Mohei...
For pity's sake!
I want to give myself up
but I can no longer do so.
They've escaped?
They could not have gone far.
Go quick!
Master lshun, did you know that 
Mohei was arrested...?
Arrested?
They say that your wife
accompanied him.
My wife?
They wanted to bring her here,
but she refused to leave Mohei's side.
They say they confessed
their adultery.
She admitted to the adultery.
They also said that you failed to
inform the police of her flight.
Naturally, as your wife is delectable.
I can totally understand your leniency.
The Government envoys are here!
Welcome them courteously.
lsan... forgive me...
I've lost my head a little.
I'm sorry to have bothered you
with such bad news.
The Great Printer lshun
having deliberately abstained...
from denouncing his wife
and his employee Mohei...
the Government has decided to...
CONFlSCATlON OF VALUABLES
OF lSHUN, THE GREAT PRINTER
A House so mighty...
brought down to this!
The Master exiled...
and Sukeimon banished!
It's like a nightmare...
Why did they punish Sukeimon?
He made a fortune from forging
the Master's accounts.
Those two were rotten.
Good riddance.
The procession of the condemned!
Make way!
How sorrowful...
how she must be suffering!
I have never seen Madam with
such an air of happiness!
Mohei as well, his expression
so alive and beaming...
It's hard to imagine they are 
on their way to the scaffold...
THE END
