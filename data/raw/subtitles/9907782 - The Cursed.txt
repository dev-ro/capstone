Yes, we need to find
a solution.
In the last three weeks,
more have joined them.
And do we know
where they are?
They are camped
between Wood Field
and Dei's Rock.
They claim the land
belongs to them.
Has anyone looked into
the validity of this claim?
There does seem to be
some validity to the claim
that dates back 80 years,
but there is nothing
on record
that can't be changed
in our favor.
Has anyone tried
to negotiate with them?
(sardonic chuckling)
They're Gypsies, Seamus.
They're laying claim
to a sizeable amount
of our shared lands
and we've made them
an offer to walk away.
The offer was substantial.
They want the land.
That can't be allowed
to happen.
We all have something
to lose in this room,
so what I'm suggesting
stays in this room.
Charlotte, Edward, off you go.
Off you go. Go, go.
The money that was offered
is used to hire mercenaries
to remove them
from the land.
In my experience,
the threat of the stick
is normally enough.

Gentlemen, you're all aware

that have brought us here
this evening,
the killing
of the local child
and the disappearance
of my own son, Edward.
Mr. John McBride
has kindly offered
to help capture the animal
that killed the Adams boy.
You are sure that this is
some kind of animal,
not the work of a madman?
After examining the body,
I concluded
that the cause of death
had been consistent
with an animal bite.
What kind of an animal
are we talking about?
Wolf.
You're a pathologist.
That's correct.
What does that mean,
exactly?
Our body speaks
even after our death.
I listen.
Isn't it a job
for hunters?
I'm sure we've all read about
the Beast of Gévaudan,
perhaps heard the stories.
You see,
I was stationed there
during the troubles
with the army.
You think what happened
in Gévaudan is happening here?
It might very well be.
Then, isn't this a job
for the army?
Unfortunately,
the army can... will...
only be deployed
if there is confirmation
that the same thing is happening
here as in Gévaudan.
Are you suggesting
that we stay inside our house
and board the windows shut?
I would strongly advise it.

We'd been stationed
to Gévaudan.
They were plagued
by a wolf.
Two people had been killed
in the first week,
six the following.
That's when the army
had been drafted in.
There was talk
that the wolf was a curse,
and if people need to know.
The first time I saw it,
it was covered
in fresh blood,
just outside our village.
By the time I got back there,
it was... too late.
Thirteen people
had been killed by the beast.
My wife and daughter
were among them.
I'm so sorry.
Did they ever catch
this wolf?
Shortly after that,
a band of traveling gypsies
came to Gévaudan.
They said the curse
had had its revenge
and was to be contained
in gypsy silver.
They then traveled northwest,
but the trail went cold
in Le Malzieu.
Well, the gypsies had a claim
on my husband's land.
My husband and the elders...
That's enough!
That's enough.
I want no more talk
of curses.
We've locked everybody
in a church,
and I have nobody
working the fields.
If you're here to help,
then please help.
I just want this beast
or this wolf or whatever it is
captured and killed.
Tomorrow
I will set the traps.

Is this a fate

(thunder rumbling)
Isabelle must never know
about this, I beg you.
What else
doesn't she know about?
Do you dream much,
Seamus?
The land of Gévaudan
had been cursed.
At night, everyone had
the same dream.
Who is she?
What?
The woman buried
in the field.
Woman... I don't know
what you're talking about.
She cursed the land.
That's absurd.
Is what you just saw absurd?
The dreams, the beast.
You were cursed,
and it started with Edward.
Edward? Edward had
nothing to do with this.
He will kill
and keep on killing.
- Edward is innocent.
- Anyone who survives an attack
will change until the curse
has had its revenge.
Revenge? I am the one
seeking revenge
for what this thing
has done to my family!
(breathing heavily)
I started this,
so I will finish it.
I will hunt it myself and put
an end to it once and for all.

We must find

We've all dreamt of the silver
that has cursed this land.
On the body of Timmy, I found
a page torn from the Bible.
He knew something
about the silver,
as there was
a passage underlined.
"As silver is melted
in the furnace,
so will you be melted
in its midst;
and you shall know
that I, the Lord,
have poured out My fury
upon you."
