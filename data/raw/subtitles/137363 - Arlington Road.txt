Come on. Do it. You chicken?
Do it!
Come on, do it.
Go on, hurry up!
-Go on. Let's just do it, okay?
-Chicken or what?
Do it.
Run! Get out!
Kid?
Hey, kid?
What happened?
Help! Somebody, help!
Somebody help!
Help!
Hold on now, you're going to be all right.
We're almost there.
Come on! Come on!
-Hello, is this the Emergency Room?
-Yes, sir.
-I'm bringing a child in!
-What is your emergency, sir?
I don't know! I'm bringing a child in!
Can you please state
the nature of your emergency?
Help!
Help him!
Let's get a code package, stat!
Prepare him for the burn unit.
Careful, sir.
It's okay now, sir. Put him in ER 3!
You have to stay with me now.
Are you the father?
-Are you the boy's father?
-No, no.
He was just in the middle of the road.
He was walking down
the middle of the road.
Have you seen him before?
What's his name?
Sir?
-What?
-Please, this is important.
What?
-His name? The boy's name?
-I don't know his name!
Excuse me, Mr. Faraday?
Yeah.
We're Brady's parents.
You feel like they're old enough.
They should be able to...
You shouldn't let them out of your sight
for a moment.
He said he was going to the park to play.
He didn't want us to know
what he was doing.
Michael, we can't thank you enough.
If you hadn't come along when you did...
No, no. I'm just glad we made it.
So, what...
He and his friends
got together all their fireworks,
their cones and their candles
and tied them up together to blast
some kind of super-rocket out of the park.
Brady is the one...
He must have been the one that set it off.
The other kids must've put him up to it.
It was just starting to feel like home, too.
I thought that to myself today.
Just thought, it's starting to feel like home.
He's going to be okay.
He will. He's going to be all right.
Thank you, Michael.
Oh, God.
It's got to be hell they're going through.
Two months they've lived there.
I haven't said one word to them.
You can't be best friends with everybody.
I watch them fixing up their house,
their kids
playing in the yard. I held their son
in my arms, hanging on for his life tonight.
The kid
lives right across the street.
I didn't even know his name.
Did he die?
No. He's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be in the hospital for a while,
but he'll be fine.
I saw the blood
in the street.
He's gonna be okay, Grant.
Brooke said she made you dinner.
You're not hungry?
You want me to fix you something?
Grant.
Is she gonna stay here every night?
No, not every night. No.
She stayed last night because I asked her.
We talked about Brooke.
You said you liked her.
I liked her better before.
Yeah, well...
Try to get some sleep, okay?
Love you.
The name of this course is
"American Terrorism."
Two hundred years ago, we fought
a revolution in the name of certain beliefs,
of liberty, of justice for all,
of self-rule and self-reliance.
There are many in this country
who feel we have not yet won that war.
Terrorist acts, violent political theater,
these have been part of social dissent
in this country since its inception.
But why? Why here, in this land of freedom?
What's led men
to such bloodshed
in the name of their beliefs?
Why in this era of national prosperity
has the anti-government movement
been at its peak?
And what's that going to mean
when the prosperity fades?
Fewer and fewer of us are voting,
more and more of us
are joining the ranks of a resistance.
How long are we going to continue
to call these numbers insignificant?
What do they have to teach us?
-I'm gonna go explore.
-Okay.
The only woman I ever liked having around
that was smarter than me.
Whit Carver, generous to a fault.
Hey there, Mr. Faraday.
-How's he doing?
-He's all right.
We're still seeing his counselor.
She says he's improving,
but he still keeps to himself a lot.
How's his dad doing?
He's all right.
Still seeing his graduate student?
-She says he's improving, but...
-He still keeps to himself a lot?
Man, Michael,
this kid they got me partnered with,
he's a walking
laptop computer-cyberspace geek.
Put him across from some real-life bad
guys, it's like he's surprised to see them.
-I ought to make him take your course.
-Yeah?
-Teaching it again, right?
-Oh, yeah.
She'd like that.
I know what that'd mean to her.
The invitation is still good, you know,
for you to come by as a guest.
I'd rather not stand trial for you, Michael.
That's not what it would be.
Yeah, right. I know what it would be.
How's work?
You know, routine.
That's what I miss, you know.
The conversations about work.
I'd tell her about my day,
and she couldn't tell me a goddamn thing.
You wouldn't think I'd miss that, but I do.
Have me to dinner sometime.
I'll keep some state secrets from you,
make you feel like she never left.
People remember her, Whit?
-What do you mean?
-At the Bureau.
Do they remember, or do people forget?
They remember her, Michael, they do.
Leah died for her country.
She shouldn't have.
Michael, hello. How are you doing?
-Our other guest of honor. Come on in.
-Hope we're not late.
No, no, no. Oliver, Michael's here!
-Cheryl, this is Brooke. Brooke, Cheryl.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-It's really nice to meet you, too.
-How are you?
-Hi, I'm Brooke.
-This must be Grant. How are you doing?
Listen, there's junk food in the kitchen,
just for kids and not for grown ups.
-Come on in.
-Let me introduce you to some friends.
-What are you gonna get?
-Hot dog, please.
-Brady's looking great.
-Yeah.
So would you, if you found a way
to get out of school for a while.
You're right. I would.
I teach at GW, American History.
I was always bad in history.
Condemned to repeat it?
Yes, several times.
So what kind of work do you do?
I'm a structural engineer.
I work for a company...
You know the Reston Mall?
-Oh, yeah.
-We are redesigning the addition.
You want bigger stores, more parking?
I'm the guy to ask.
He knows. I'm not sure
he totally understands what happened.
You know Michael from?
I was Michael's teaching assistant
in my first year of grad school.
There was nothing between us back then.
I knew his family. I knew Leah.
This thing is kind of,
kind of new between us.
Well, you're so sweet together.
Well, of course, I think the world of him.
He's such a good man
such a good father.
This job was just too appealing to pass up.
Contracts were down all over St. Louis.
-How long were you in St. Louis?
-About four years thereabouts.
I grew up on a farm
in a place called Carson, Kansas.
I never lived east before.
Kids will get to see their first ocean.
-I'm afraid downtown is falling apart.
-That's what I hear.
I guess we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.
Hannah?
Bedtime.
Grant!
-Be careful of his hand!
-I got two hands!
It's been a long time since I've seen him
just being a kid. Sometimes, he...
You know, since his mother...
He has a tough time
making friends sometimes.
Michael, we all need friends.
Life just isn't the same without them.
-Dad?
-Yeah.
How do you spell "restricted"?
Restricted. R-E-S-T-R-I...
You know how to use the dictionary, Grant.
What are you guys doing in there?
Building a compound.
-A compound?
-A soldiers' compound.
Stop, Dad.
You have to know the secret handshake.
Should we tell him?
All right.
Just so I know you're not going
to use any fireworks in there, Brady.
General Brady, Dad.
No fireworks, General Brady.
That's classified information, Mr. Faraday.
-You don't know the secret handshake.
-I'm serious, Brady.
Come on, Grant.
Get washed up guys.
We're going to get dinner on.
Michael, hi. Come on in.
I got something for you in my mailbox.
-The University of Pennsylvania?
-I thought you hadn't lived east before.
I haven't.
I went to Kansas State, Class of '78.
They have me mixed up with someone else.
-Same class?
-Yes, but at K-State.
It's a reunion.
Must have lost track of some guy
and sent it to me instead.
Sorry about the mess. Cheryl and the girls
are at a church group tonight.
I'm trying to catch up on a little work.
-How are you?
-Good, good.
-How's Grant?
-He's doing great.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Excuse me a minute. Hello?
Yeah, I can't really talk.
Why don't I call you back?
What do you mean?
You're kidding?
Well, we should really
talk in person about this. Yes.
I can work on this tonight. Okay, all right.
Listen, hold on a second.
This project is taking forever
to get together.
The client can't seem to make up his mind.
-This the Reston Mall?
-Yeah, we're getting it on track.
I'm sorry, I have to...
We'll see each other this weekend?
-Yes! The Junior D's.
-The thing Brady keeps talking about.
He's gonna love it. He's gonna make more
friends than he'll know what to do with.
-Yeah?
-They do campouts, they do trips.
It'll give
you the house to yourself
every now and then.
You and Brooke, I mean.
-Thank you, neighbor.
-For what?
For having a 10-year old next door.
What do you know about shopping malls?
Shopping malls. I was over at the Langs'
talking with Oliver.
He had this blueprint on his counter.
He said it was the Reston Mall.
-That's the one he's working on.
-Yeah. But it wasn't.
-What do you mean, it wasn't?
-Well, I looked, Brooke.
It was a building, it wasn't a mall.
Right, it's an addition.
No, it was an office building.
It wasn't stores at all.
So it's some other project
that he's working on.
Why would he tell me it was a mall
if it wasn't? Why would he lie?
Michael, when you took engineering
in college, what kind of grades did you get?
I didn't take engineering.
What I saw was an office building.
Fourteen months ago,
on a Monday in January
over 60 federal employees went to work
like they always did
at the Roosevelt Federal Building
in downtown St. Louis.
Except on that Monday,
they didn't come home.
In a truck parked in front
was hidden 50 pounds
of C-4 plastic explosives.
When it was detonated it disintegrated
the entire street side of the building
obliterating dozens of government offices,
the building's daycare center,
and the St. Louis branch
of the Internal Revenue Service,
which was ultimately determined
to be the target of the attack.
The truck was leased
by this 33-year-old electrician.
Dean Scobee.
Scobee had served prison time
for tax evasion.
And surveillance videos showed that
he was inside the vehicle,
leaving him among the 63 dead.
Does anyone not remember this?
We all remember the results
of the investigation.
-They said Scobee acted alone.
-One man. No conspirators. Right.
He cheated the IRS.
They caught him at it, so he blew them up.
This is a guy who people described
as average,
friendly.
He'd been in the army, but as a radio man.
He had very little experience with munitions.
His parents considered him
a moderate conservative.
And two weeks prior to this,
he received a pay raise
at his electrician's job!
Does that sound like a man
who's on the edge or who needed a push?
Come on. I don't know. I'm just asking.
Come on, Professor.
The Feds, they did this huge investigation.
That's right, an investigation. I forgot.
Well, the investigation didn't satisfy me.
Miss O'Neal, when you first heard the news,
terrorist attack in your own country,
how did that make you feel?
-Come on.
-Well...
What did you feel?
Angry,
scared and stressed.
-Did you feel safe?
-No.
Then the next day,
when they found Scobee dead,
did you feel some relief? Did safety return?
The people in that building, they felt safe,
secure.
Just like you feel now.
Then, an instant later,
in an instant,
they were gone forever.
We needed to have this man to blame.
We don't want others.
We want one name and we want it fast
because it gives us our security back.
We can say, "Here was the one man,
unlike the rest of us.
"We've named him, and he is no more.
"And his reasons, they're gone, too."
But the truth is, we don't know his reasons,
we don't know why Scobee did it.
Why it came to this!
We can pretend we do,
the $10,000 in taxes, but we don't know.
And we'll never know.
And still we feel safe
because we know his name.
-As God is my witness
-As God is my witness

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Junior Discovery Troop 474.
This is Oliver's study where he, you know,
gets away from the kids and me, I suppose.
These are all projects you've worked on?
I wish. No, I collect sketches, blueprints,
designs of old buildings.
This is a front view of Monticello.
Down there is the Woolworth Building.
It's his hobby.
-The St. Louis Arch.
-Yes, correct.
So, then all these drawings, these buildings,
they're not just for your job, then?
No.
So they're not all shopping malls.
No, I don't know of any
architecturally significant shopping malls.
Honey, you just haven't built them yet.
-Who's hungry?
-I'm famished.
Come on.
I've got some really delicious puff pastry.
They work so hard when they're there.
You've gotta keep them in their seats.
Politically, there's something
to be said for that, I think.
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
Here we are leaving the church.
Everyone thought we were going to Mexico.
Where were you going?
We were going there,
but the plane never left the ground.
Some engine trouble.
We couldn't leave till morning, so we
wound up spending our wedding night
at the Wichita Airport Motel.
How romantic.
For $1 9, it was wonderful.
How long have you two been married?
Twelve years in August.
...what kind of example
is that for everybody else?
I don't think
we learn responsibility from politicians.
We really learn it from family.
It's the people that we care about.
It's what they care about. That's where...
My dad, he died when I was a teenager.
-I'm sorry.
-Farm accident.
My father, mostly.
Who would you say you get yours from?
My what? My values?
Probably from my wife.
Values? What values?
Well, Michael and I were talking about
where you get your values from
and we were both saying
it's mostly from family.
Where else are you gonna get them?
Celebrities? Politicians?
Not in this century.
I just think it's a sorry state of affairs
when you can't find a role model
to cast your vote for.
It's not even role models, necessarily,
it's just people who acknowledge
the consequences of their actions.
Or pay for those actions.
I think we should put
some of these politicians in jail.
Oliver, you can't ask government
to be infallible. You just can't.
But you can ask it to be accountable.
I can ask it to be honest.
You know, when Leah died all I wanted
was someone to tell me,
"We made a mistake." You know?
"We made a mistake,
your wife suffered for it,
"and we'd take it back 100 times
if we could."
But they don't say that.
She would've.
Some of them knew her.
They work so hard at being able
to look you in the eye.
Excuse me.
Leave him alone. He's fine.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I see how much you miss her.
There are just times, you know,
when you realize how much of your own life
is out of your hands.
What are you gonna do?
I guess you can have faith.
Try to make a difference
where you can with Grant,
with your classes.
What about you?
I've got my family.
And the buildings I leave behind.
That's it.
Get your shoulder up a little bit, okay?
Step into it.
Watch that ball until it hits the bat.
-That's it, that's it!
-Brady?
You want some Cracker Jack?
You sure? Popcorn and caramel,
it builds your muscles.
All right.
Hey, atta way, Faraday.
He's getting confidence up there.
He's a strong kid.
-He's been dealt some hard breaks.
-Way to swing.
You give him strength, Michael.
-I'm trying.
-You do.
Getting on with your life.
That's important for him to see.
He just wishes someone had to pay.
What?
For his mother,
he just wishes someone had to pay.
He's talked to you about her?
Her people send her in
with the wrong information
and then say, "Hey, not my fault."
I can't live with that.
Or you, let alone a 9-year-old boy.
Grant talked to you about his mother?
Well, yeah.
I hope that's all right.
We talk about a lot of things.
He's a smart kid.
Way to go, Grant.
Never more wise than when we're children.
They say it and it's true.
We'll never see things that clear again.
Let me have a hit.
Grant? Grant?
Grant, come on, now, it's dinnertime!
Wash your hands!
-I'm eating with Brady!
-No. Come on, now.
Michael, I'm sorry. Brady invited him over
for dinner. I thought he'd asked you.
Can I eat with Brady, Dad?
Okay, if his dad says it's all right.
Is it all right, kids?
I can fly!
-Good afternoon. U. Penn.
-Transcript office, please.
Transcripts.
Yeah, hi. I'm calling
from George Washington University.
We have a student who's applying for
graduate work in our history department
and I need to verify
his undergrad record with you guys.
He's been out of school for some time.
The name is Oliver Lang.
Are you telling me you took this
out of his mailbox? That is illegal.
Just tell me you don't think
this sounds strange.
The University of Pennsylvania keeps
sending alumni stuff for a 20-year reunion.
He says he went to Kansas State. They have
him mixed up with some other Oliver Lang.
So, I called Penn,
I get that guy's transcripts.
-What? Why? Michael...
-Brooke, listen to me.
That guy has a completely different
physical description.
He never took a class in engineering.
Right, honey, because they've got him
mixed up with somebody else.
Brooke, this U. Penn "Oliver"
is the same age as Oliver.
-Wait. As our...
-As our Oliver. Yes!
He graduated the same year
and he comes from Carson, Kansas.
Oliver's hometown.
Wait, I'm totally lost here.
You just said they are two different people.
Two people of the same age
from the same small town.
I looked it up. It's a small town!
Yeah. So what?
Brooke, don't you think they would've heard
of each other, these guys, growing up?
Gotten mixed up before?
Oliver didn't say anything like that.
He just threw the letter away.
-So... So...
-Wait a minute.
There could be 10 other Michael Faradays
in Northern Virginia
-and you would never know that.
-So, I called Kansas State.
Here's what I'm saying,
Kansas State University had no Oliver Lang
on record from that year or any year.
So, either he didn't really go to that school
or that is not his real name.
Can I ask you something?
Did you do this to me
when we started dating?
-What?
-Call up my ex-boyfriends,
get my transcripts sent over?
You got to admit
there is something not right here.
No, this isn't right.
You have invaded his privacy.
So maybe he lied about
where he went to college. Big deal.
People lie about things all the time.
It doesn't give you the right to spy on them.
God, you of all people.
I mean, are you teaching the Bill of Rights
this semester
or did that not make the program?
I don't know what you're doing.
We've made some friends here.
All right?
I'll see you tonight.
Lang.
Shit.
"Fenimore."
'Cause you've never been
away from home before, Grant!
-You're nine years old!
-Nine and a half!
-There'll be grown-ups there! Lots.
-The answer is no, Grant!
It's spring vacation. You said I could go.
Well, now I'm saying
that you can't go, Grant!
You know, look, maybe you can go
for summer camp or something, okay?
Brady's going!
Brady might not be the best kid
for you to be alone in the woods with!
-Dad.
-The answer is no!
He's my best friend.
Grant, look, you want to go to camp so bad,
we'll go to
Aunt Ruth's and Uncle Rob's cabin, okay?
-That's a lie.
-No, it's not.
-You'll be too busy! You'll forget!
-Maybe just you and me.
You'll forget you said I could go!
-Come here.
-He lied to me.
The FBI keeps a file on every American
who has ever been charged with a crime.
Now, certain offenses
cause files to be flagged.
Two years ago, these flags,
they picked up a series of suspicious
firearms purchases in Maryland,
Georgia and the Carolinas.
There were 100 guns from assault rifles,
army-issues
all bought by acquaintances
of Seaver Parsons.
Husband, father of three,
amateur gun-collector,
an outspoken member of the right-wing
extremists here in West Virginia.
To the FBI, it appeared that Parsons
was stockpiling weapons
for some sort of offensive.
So, they sent four FBI agents
with a search warrant here
thinking that they would uncover some sort
of treasure chest of felony firearms.
Munitions for war.
Seven-November, we got you eyeballed.
Backup's en route.
How're you gonna handle this, Boss?
The easy way.
Yeah. I heard that.
Hey, there, mister.
You catch yourself some dinner?
Is that your house over there?
Do you know if your father is home, son?
He don't know you.
No, son, we're from Washington.
Here at this fence line, they encountered
Parsons' youngest son, age 10.
They asked him where his father was,
but they neglected,
failed to first identify themselves
as federal agents.
Why don't you run on up
and ask your daddy to come outside
because there's some people out here
that would like to speak to him. Okay?
-Cover the house.
-No, stay here! The backup is coming.
The kid doesn't know why we're here!
They're here! They're here! They're coming!
Jeb, they're coming!
-Get back, he's just a kid!
-They're here! They're here!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Ma!
Just hold on.
Pinned down, they returned fire.
And finally, the reinforcements arrived.
When it was over,
the siege lasted over two hours.
At the end, Parsons'
two eldest sons were wounded.
His wife and his youngest boy were killed.
And as for Parsons,
he wasn't even home.
See, the FBI, they thought
that their people were uncovering
some sort of terrorist plot, you see?
But what their file,
their flags, did not reveal to them
was that Seaver Parsons had come
into a family inheritance
with which he had arranged
the 100 legal firearms
to be legally purchased!
Nor did it tell them that Parsons
had recently applied for a sales license.
Nor did it tell them
that Parsons warned his family that some
people might want to steal his collection!
And he instructed his sons and his wife
and his daughter-in-law
never to let strangers on this property
while he was away.
And if force be taken
then to defend with force! Defend the home!
You know,
he had no love for the federal government.
He did have a separatist
and a suspicious past.
But this was not a terrorist.
He was not a criminal.
And three innocent people died that day
because the flags went up.
And the flags were wrong.
Don't just dive in.
I want you to think for yourself.
-I want you to be safe.
-Let go of my hand!
All right. Okay, okay. Look.
I want you to have a great time, okay?
And listen to your Troopmaster, all right?
Did Brooke tell you to let me go?
Yes, she did, as a matter of fact.
She said that you're a big guy and you can
handle 10 days away. She's right.
When I get back
is she going to take Mom's place?
Nobody is ever going to
take your mom's place.
Not Brooke. Nobody.
Mom is always going to be with us.
Right here.
Because we remember her
like nothing could ever take her away.
If Brooke and I ever start thinking
about something like that
we're going to talk to you about it first.
She'll only ever live with us
if Mom says it's okay, too.
Okay.
You have a great time.
Thanks for camp, Dad.
You have a good one. All right.
-Thanks, Dad. See you!
-See you later!
His name was William Fenimore
and I'm told he changed it to Oliver Lang.
It may take me a few moments, sir.
Okay, we do have a William Fenimore of
Carson, Kansas changed to an Oliver Lang.
Do you know when that was?
October 5, 1981 .
Thank you very much,
that's exactly what I was looking for.
State of Kansas, Department of Records.
Yes, hi. Michael Jones.
I'm with the E.E.O.C. in Washington.
I've got a possible name change
I wanted to run by you guys.
I'm looking for an Oliver Lang.
He's out of Carson, Kansas.
Hold on, sir.
Sir, I'm afraid we've got nothing
on any name change
for an Oliver Lang of Carson, Kansas.
Okay. Just doing my job. Thank you.
Sir, our records indicate Oliver Lang
deceased as of October 4, 1981 .
-October 4th?
-Yes, sir.
The 4th.
What does it say?
The death certificate, what does it say?
Cause of death is listed as gunshot.
Hunting accident.
You had said you were calling
with whom in Washington?
Thank you.
Just run through the scenario with me.
Theoretically, why would someone do that?
Do what? Change his name to the name
of the person who died the day before?
Yeah. Someone the same age,
from the same hometown. Why?
Would it be to take over that person's life?
No, that wouldn't work.
See, when you die, the death certificate
goes above state and federal.
Driver's licenses,
Social Security numbers, they're voided.
You couldn't do it
to hide the person you are.
Then why would you do it?
You do it to hide the person you were.
Say you wanted to find out a criminal record
for your guy prior to the name change.
Unless you're a real professional...
I see, you'd check on the name he has now.
And the records you'd find back then
would be for somebody else entirely.
That's the significance of making
the change right after a person's death.
No overlap.
-It gives you a whole new history.
-It helps the old one disappear.
Is there something you want
to tell me, Michael?
Whit, if I give you a name,
could you run it for flags?
Jesus, Michael.
Just this once.
Check out files as a personal favor?
That's what you're asking me to do?
Come on, I'm not...
-You don't get fired for that. You go to jail.
-Whit, this is important!
-My pension is important!
-Whit!
I'm asking you to run a name.
I'm not asking you to start surveillance
and break out the goddamn guns!
Faraday, if you'd asked your wife to do it,
she'd tell you the same thing.
Get you classified FBI information?
She'd say,
"I love you, baby, but that I cannot do."
Michael, if you want to find out about
somebody, there's always ways to do it.
But just not through me.
Come on, use your imagination.
Hi, Daphne. How are you doing?
You doing okay?
Hi, Hannah.
Mommy and Daddy aren't home.
Well, you know... You know what...
Actually, I don't need your mom and dad.
You know what,
I locked myself out of my house.
I came home from work and realized...
We can't let strangers in.
Well, I'm not a stranger. Right?
See, what I need to do is use your phone
to call up somebody
to see if they'll help me get in the house.
Would that be all right, if I use your phone?
Kitchen.
Good.
You know what, I'm gonna use the phone
in your dad's study.
You guys are playing here.
That's Dad's study!
I'll just be a sec. You guys go ahead
and play. Your dad won't mind.
Well, yes, I got a home lockout.
I need your help to get back in.
Faraday, Michael.
2505 Arlington Road in Reston.
No, no, that's no problem.
Yes, I have identification.
Michael!
You locked yourself out?
You scared the shit out of me.
I was on the phone
and the picture was falling.
It was crooked, so I...
Yeah, the locksmith guy is coming.
Good. Good. Did you want to wait here?
I'm just back from the store.
No, thanks.
I got a call from Brady today.
He and Grant are having a wonderful time.
He went on and on and on
about what kind of bugs they're catching.
I don't know if there's any kind
of badge for that.
Can I offer you something?
No, I should really get back to some papers
that I can grade while I wait.
-But, thank you for the call.
-Sure.
Thank you, girls.
Our house is your house.
Michael, just a sec. You forgot your case.
And your phone.
Need to recharge my batteries.
I know the feeling.
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Pretending to wait for a locksmith.
-Why?
-I pretended to be locked out.
-Why was that again?
-I'll explain it to you.
Can we pretend to have dinner first?
Hi, neighbor.
"Pipe bomb."
"Sources say the agency...
"William Fenimore, senior..."
How's the hunting?
Hey, Oliver.
I was in the city on a project,
went by your office, they said check here.
-Got some research going?
-Yes, '70s.
-Is that the Kansas City Star?
-Yeah.
-That's the paper I read growing up.
-It's for a lecture course.
I got a class that deals
with extremist groups.
American History,
background on state militias.
There's one in Kansas.
It seems they got one everywhere.
Jeez, I didn't know you taught a course
in terrorism.
-That's a pretty frightening subject.
-Yeah.
Got time for a drink?
No. No. Today's not good.
Yeah, I hear you. I got a building contract.
It's kicking my butt trying to put it together.
Hey, listen, get back to work. I'm sorry to
drop by. Catch you back at the ranch.
Good to see you.
Will you just hear me out?
Hear what I am saying.
The guy changed his name, Brooke. Why?
To help hide his background. Why?
Because there's something in it!
Yeah. Something that's not your business,
Michael.
Brooke, when he was 1 6 years old, he tried
to blow up some offices. Read the paper.
A government agency
that was cheating his father's farm.
He served time in a juvenile program.
Pipe bomb. As a kid.
Why would you go to these lengths
to hide that part of your history?
If it wasn't an isolated event. If you thought
you might try it again someday.
Michael, this says, it didn't even go off.
He was a kid!
Brooke, Brady practically killed himself
with a bunch of fireworks.
What, in March? Come on!
Where do you think that comes from?
Where does Brady get an idea like that?
What are you saying?
I'm saying that he's going
to these great lengths to hide his past.
I'm saying that he was in St. Louis
when the Federal building was bombed.
And I'm saying, Brooke,
that there is a blueprint in his house
that he does not want me to see.
-Are you listening to yourself?
-Are you listening to me?
-Are you listening to me?
-Your neighbor...
-Yes.
-...is a terrorist.
-Brooke. Brooke!
-He has been blowing up buildings.
There's something going on over there!
Something is being planned!
Something is being planned? Yeah.
And, you know, in his spare time, he pays
the mortgage and takes his kid to camp
-and takes his daughters to ballet class.
-Brooke, that house is not normal.
That house is normal, Michael.
Brooke, do you remember when
we were over there the other night?
-Him discussing politics with us?
-Yeah, we disagree about politics.
And Washington? And Leah?
Do you remember this?
-Brooke, the guy is testing me.
-You're the one who brought up Leah.
Brooke, he wants to see
if I'm an enemy or an ally!
Michael, you are the one
who brought up Leah.
Is that what this is about?
No, it's not about Leah.
This class that you slave over,
you know, to carry on Leah's work,
to have something in her memory.
You know, these plots and conspiracies
and red flags going up!
Yeah, yeah. This is Leah's world, you know.
I can't.
Listen, I know that
he's changed his name.
-Michael, Michael. Stop it, for me.
-He lived in St. Louis
-when the bombs were going off.
-For me.
And he's working on this building
that he doesn't want me to see.
I don't think I can stay here tonight.
I'm not staying.
Brooke.
I never did like that picture.
You know me, Michael?
You think you know me?
Yeah, you know me better
than I know myself, don't you?
The Kansas City Star. I saw you.
You want to tell me something
I don't know?
I know what I read.
You know a 1 6-year-old kid.
You don't know me. You know a kid at 1 6.
Damn you!
You've been a guest in my house!
You're a guest in mine, Fenimore.
Bill, Will. William? What do I call you?
Who the hell do you think you are,
judging me?
What gives you the right?
You ever worked on a farm, Michael?
To make your living? Support your family?
The government stole my father's water.
The stream that ran through our land.
They said they were appropriating it
for other uses.
We couldn't grow crops,
we couldn't raise cattle.
We had loans we couldn't pay.
My father woke up one morning
and he realized he was worth more
dead than alive.
His skin and bones were worth more
in insurance money than as a damn farmer.
I found his tractor at the bottom
of the bluffs behind our house.
He made it look like an accident.
I found his body. And the note.
He wrote it to me.
The insurance money paid off
what Mom could but it wasn't enough.
The neighbors took our land at auction.
All because some bureaucrat
stuck a pin in a map.
Some creek in the middle of Kansas.
Said we couldn't use our own water.
-Didn't give you the right to build a bomb.
-I was 1 6!
Sixteen! You ever do anything wrong
when you were 1 6?
You ever crash your car?
You ever steal anything?
You ever screw the wrong girl?
You're gonna tell your kid everything
you did when you were 1 6, Michael?
The lies you told, the drugs you took?
I've been judged for this.
I got sent away for it.
You know what, it was the best thing that
ever could've happened to me. Best thing.
Who is Oliver?
He was my best friend growing up.
He died when we were both 25.
I did it to honor him,
to carry on his name.
And to hide. Yeah, to hide.
Because I didn't want any son I had
knowing what I did.
'Cause I didn't want my kids to be burdened
with people looking through
old newspapers.
I'm not proud of this.
This isn't pride.
I wish it never happened.
You know, I wish to God
that my family could have
my father's good name.
You know, you have a right to know
who lives next door.
Who talks to your kid,
who considers himself your friend.
But you also have the right...
If you have a problem with me,
if you have issues with me,
you could have the decency to walk
across the street and tell me to my face.
Oliver!
Hi, this is Michael. Leave a message.
Michael, it's me. Listen, I think you're right.
I saw Oliver at the mall in the garage
and he switched cars with somebody
and I followed him
to this warehouse delivery place
and they were unloading
these long metal boxes.
I want to talk to you. I'm coming over, okay?
Cheryl.
Brooke.
I knew it was you.
-Hi.
-Hi.
What are you doing here?
Just shopping. What are you doing here?
Shopping.
Great.
Yeah.
They say a man was shot several times
while driving along 19th Street.
His out-of-control car struck several
other vehicles before slamming into a tree.
The victim was pronounced dead
at the scene.
Elsewhere, a single car accident
near Reston
is tying up evening traffic
on westbound Route 7 at this hour.
Details are sketchy at this point.
What we can tell from our overhead shot
is the accident took place
near the Pine Glen Outlet Center.
No other vehicles appeared to be involved
in what police say is a fatal crash.
We'll have more information for you
when it becomes available.
The driver of the car, described
as a woman in her mid-20s,
has been pronounced dead at the scene.
Police say it appears she lost control
of her light blue 1989 Mustang
and crashed through a guard rail
along the ravine.
Investigators believe she was killed
upon impact...
Sir, you can't go down there!
Sir, you can't come down here!
You can't go down there.
-Where is she? Where is she?
-We've got to keep this area clear, sir.
-She's gone, sir. She's been taken away.
-Where?
Where?
-She's gone.
-Where?
I'm sorry.
No.
Hey, General, how you holding up?
Dad, we gotta go camping. It's so cool!
We went swimming and climbing.
And one night, there was a lightning storm.
We had to stay in a motel!
You did?
I learned how to make shelters
and campfires, and there's knots and knives.
And me and Brady can tell animal tracks.
That's terrific.
Dad, I have to go.
The Troopmaster is calling us.
We're doing a cave hike.
Okay, Grant, I'll see you in a couple of days.
I love you.
Dad, I've got to go!
It's better to tell him when he gets back.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Michael, if there's anything you need...
-No.
-...we're here.
No, I won't.
I'll be fine, it's just...
Don't let yourself...
I mean, sometimes it's better not to be alone
when you don't have to be.
She was a good person, Michael. Kind.
A kind girl.
If I haven't been myself
these past few weeks,
-I'm sorry for everything.
-Michael, Michael.
She liked you, your family very much.
We're here for you. We really are.
-Hello.
-Michael, it's Whit.
How you doing?
I haven't heard back from you, man.
Whit, my girlfriend, Brooke,
was killed Friday.
-God, Michael, no.
-Yeah.
Can I talk to you later?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Whenever.
I'm here at the office.
Thanks.
Agent Carver.
Whit?
What did you mean,
you haven't heard back from me?
The message I left on Friday.
I understand now.
-It's all right.
-What message?
The one about speaking to your class.
You had asked me to speak as a guest.
I thought with some ground rules
we could set some things straight.
Wait, you called me Friday?
You left a message?
Yes, at the house.
When did you call?
I don't know.
Around 4:00 or 5:00 maybe, on Friday.
I didn't have any messages.
Michael, for Christ's sake,
you had just found out about Brooke...
No, I didn't have any messages.
I'll call you back.
-Yeah, Whit, listen to me.
-Michael...
I know you can't do anything for me.
You can't give me any information.
But I can give you information.
The other day when I was talking about
somebody trying to hide their history,
I was talking about my neighbor.
Oliver Lang! That's his name.
He used to be...
It used to be William Fenimore!
I want you to run it through the system
for me. See what you've got.
-Oliver Lang. You writing this down?
-Yeah, Michael, slow down.
He has a history, damn it!
Will you run the name?
Michael, Michael, wait! What's he done?
If I'm right, there were other people
who called my house that day, not just you.
Find out, will you? You can do that.
Now, please.
-I'll call you when I get back.
-Back? Where the hell are you going?
To get you proof!
Run the name, Whit.
Run the name!
Was it hard to find me?
You've moved several times.
Your wife said that... Your ex-wife...
People know whose father I am.
Mister, I've been through all this before.
The government, the police
and writers.
People wanted to believe it was political.
Some conspiracy, some group.
Abby and I did, too.
Dean was not a strong boy.
He was impressionable.
Believed what friends around him said.
Why couldn't he be involved with people
who could set him up,
talk him into, you know, even this?
The FBI, the police, found nothing.
It was him alone. They decided this.
Sixty-three dead.
Over taxes.
Dean alone.
You don't believe that, do you?
I will never believe that.
Have you heard the name Oliver Lang?
Or William Fenimore?
I've heard too many names.
Your son, Dean, was an electrician.
Maybe, he was contracted for,
or he worked on a project...
All of this was investigated, mister!
His neighbors, his customers,
kids he grew up with, months ago!
Dr. Scobee, I'm sorry
for bringing this all back.
It never goes away.
I had to come here.
You've got to understand,
I think I know a man who knew your son.
He's 41 , a structural engineer.
He's got a wife, three kids. He has this...
May I ask what makes you so sure
that this man of yours
had anything to do
with what happened here?
For the same reason you're sure
your son didn't do it alone.
I know my son was not alone
because 10 children died that day!
The daycare center in the Roosevelt,
he had to know it was there.
My son would never have done anything
to harm children. Not on his own.
-Your son didn't have any children.
-No.
But he did things for them.
He sponsored boys from city shelters.
Discoverer Troops.
He coached boys football when he had time.
Wait. Wait, Discoverer Troops?
They're like Boy Scouts,
but for young children.
He was a grown-up chaperone.
He'd take them camping.
He'd go to their meetings, teach.
Here he is. He must've been
on some weekend adventure.
Dean was best with children.
Mr. Faraday? Professor?
Gate 40!
Faraday. Grant Faraday.
I'll be there in a few hours.
Don't let him go anywhere. I'm coming.
Tell him I'm coming.
I'm here to pick up my son.
I called earlier this afternoon.
My son!
What was that troop, sir?
Troop? I don't know what troop!
He's from Reston. Grant Faraday.
Where's my son?
Faraday?
-He was taken home this afternoon, sir.
-No.
His father called.
No, no, wait, wait. I'm his father. I called.
But you, you called twice, sir.
You said that there had been
an accident at home, a car accident.
No.
You asked to speak
with his Troopmaster, sir.
I'm his goddamn father. That wasn't me.
Here it is, sir. He was driven home.
By who?
His Troopmaster, sir.
He and another boy.
What other boy?
Lang. Brady Lang.
The Troopmaster left with both of them.
You're doing it again, Michael.
I thought I told you, you should come to me
if there's something you want to know.
-Where's my son?
-He's with mine. They're safe.
-Can I get you something to drink?
-I saved his life!
-What's that? Yes, yes.
-Your son, I saved his life!
And that's why you're still here with us.
And Brooke? What...
Brooke got in the way.
We're on a schedule. It's nothing personal.
What the hell have you done with my son?
If you want to be his father,
you'll walk to your house,
sleep in your bed, teach your classes
and live your life.
What are you doing?
How many people are you going to kill?
Well...
If I see any strange cars on my street,
if you feel compelled to talk to anyone,
a federal agent, perhaps?
Then I imagine we're just going to kill one.
He's 9 years old.
When will he be 10?
He's a good kid.
He's a strong kid.
Reminds me of a boy I grew up with.
Maybe you've heard of him?
Oliver Lang?
They found him in the woods one day.
I would hate for Grant to see the same fate.
-You sick fuck!
-You're the sick fuck!
You're the sick fuck.
I promise you, Michael,
if you stay a good neighbor,
and you are a good neighbor,
you'll have him back.
But if you don't calm down, I don't know
that I can guarantee his safety.
-This'll all be over in a few days.
-When?
-You're not in any danger.
-When? Tell me.
Michael. Michael.
Please.
Because of you, my son is alive.
I would like very much to return the favor.
Now, we're having a party.
You're more than welcome to stay.
Come on, kids.
You got your lunch?
We're going on a field trip today.
-Bye, sweetie.
-Bye.
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.
Put your seat belt on.
You're a hard man to find.
Whit, what are you...
Your assistant told me you've been taking
long walks between classes, long walks.
Yeah. I can't talk to you now. I...
No? Can you talk to me ever?
You look like shit, Michael.
What's going on?
-I'm here about Oliver Lang.
-I've got to get to my class, Whit. I...
How about you teach me something?
Oliver Lang, formerly William Fenimore.
We gave him a good look
after the St. Louis thing, Michael.
Everybody who ever used a bomb
got a good look.
His name change was legal.
We ran the social security number
through the National Crime Center.
Not a mark on his record ever since.
Him and everyone he knew came up clean.
That's what you found out about?
That Wichita shit
back when he was 1 6 got you thinking.
Do you have something new
on this guy or not?
Or did you just not like him
in your neighborhood?
'Cause if you got nothing, Michael,
if this is all you've got,
then you know what?
You need to stop teaching that class
'cause it's getting inside your head.
You tell me you got something to go on
and I'll go.
But I'm not going to walk into another
Copper Creek and neither should you.
I got nothing, Whit. I'm sorry.
All right. Look...
I ran those phone records like you asked.
It could've meant my job, but I did it.
Two telephone calls on Friday,
one from me and another from
a pay phone out Route 1 80,
Pine Glen Outlets.
Pine Glen?
And a telephone call from your neighbor.
Nothing.
Talk to me, Michael. What's going on?
Talk to me.
Give up the goddamn class.
Yeah, I'd like to rent a car
tomorrow morning.
How early could I pick that up?
Michael Faraday.
Oliver Lang, please?
Mr. Lang is out of the office, sir.
Would you like to leave a message?
No, I need to reach him.
This is a business emergency.
Mr. Lang isn't expected in this morning, sir.
Is there...
No, I'll call back. Thanks.
-Is there something else...
-No.
No!
Grant! Grant!
Grant!
Hey, neighbor, are you all right?
What are you doing on this side of town?
You had to know, didn't you?
You had to know.
Couldn't leave your neighbor alone.
Didn't you check up on me?
Didn't you?
Do you really think
we'd leave anything to chance?
Liberty One.
-I've got you, Shadow. Go ahead.
-Oliver.
We're still on schedule.
-You going to miss your son, Michael?
-Please.
You've given me no choice!
You think I wanted this?
I told you, you were gonna get him back.
How am I gonna do that now?
How am I gonna trust you?
Where are you taking him?
Where's the bomb?
I'm a messenger, Michael. I'm a messenger!
There's millions of us,
waiting to take up arms.
Ready to spread the word! Millions of us!
No!
The government is not who you're killing!
Yes, yes, they'll pay.
They'll pay for their sins.
-You're killing children!
-No lies. Children?
-Children die!
-This is war, Michael.
In war, children die.
You're with us. You're with us!
-Liberty Two. Liberty Two, status?
-Shadow One, go.
When they ask you what you stand for,
you tell them you stand for
blowing up families, for orphaned sons.
Your father really kill himself,
you son of a bitch?
Or is that just where you got your start?
-Call it off.
-It's for you, Michael.
-It's for all of us.
-It's not for me! Call it off!
Are you happy in your godless,
suburban life?
Call off the bomb!
Call off the fucking bomb!
No!
They sent your wife to her death, Michael!
Surely, you won't be sorry to see them go.
You're too late!
Damn it!
Let's get it done.
-Agent Carver.
-Whit, listen to me.
There's a bomb on its way to your offices.
You've got to get everybody out
of the building.
-Michael, what's going on?
-It's in a white van!
A Liberty delivery van! Grant's in there!
-They're coming after you guys.
-Michael. Michael?
-They said they want the FBI this time!
-Michael!
-You're breaking up!
-Whit?
-Michael? Michael?
-Whit!
Shit!
Come on! Come on!
Security. Main Gate.
Shit.
Out of the way!
That's the van!
Stop it!
-Stop the van!
-Sir!
Sir, step out of the vehicle!
-There's a bomb in the van!
-Sir, step out of the vehicle!
-Michael!
-It's got a goddamn bomb!
-Michael.
-Whit, that's the van!
There's a bomb in there!
That van was authorized!
That's the van! Grant's inside!
It's the noon delivery.
Grant's in there.
He's got a goddamn bomb!
Hold your fire!
Don't shoot!
-In the van! In the van!
-Don't shoot.
Get everyone out of the building!
There's a bomb in the van!
-Check the van.
-Whit!
Get them out of the building!
-Check the goddamn van.
-Whit. Whit.
You have to get everybody out of here.
There's a bomb.
It's in there!
Wait. That's...
-That's not the man. Grant!
-All right.
-Let him go. I said, let him go!
-Let go.
Let him go.
Back off, back off.
The van's clean.
Grant!
Go ahead, Michael, go ahead.
-What's going on?
-Who is this guy?
Michael, it's all clear.
The guy is authorized to be here.
We're all authorized to be here,
everyone except you.
All right?
Come on.
Michael?
It's all right.
Come back. Michael!
Hey, guys!
Stand by.
Everyone except you.
Boom.
Right now, I'm sort of breathless.
I've just gotten here and there are people
lying on the pavement everywhere.
I see at least a half a dozen people here.
Their faces are covered with blood.
There are crowds of people on the street.
Everybody's...
The scene here is unbelievable!
It looks just like a war zone!
I'm looking at the building right now.
All I can tell you is part of it is blown away.
Officials at this point believe
a bomb went off.
They're not sure which floor, how big.
Obviously, it was massive,
to create the kind of devastation...
Officials by proxy have no idea at this point.
They just know it is
an unbelievably serious situation.
Preliminary reports indicate the bombing
was the work of this man,
Michael Faraday of Reston, Virginia.
A professor of history
at George Washington University...
Officials will not confirm reports
that the bombing had anything to do
with the death of Mr. Faraday's wife,
who had been an FBI agent.
Students and colleagues both say
that Faraday's behavior
was increasingly erratic
in the weeks leading up...
He was really intense, you know,
knew all about these terrorists,
how they worked, what they wanted.
He was really into it.
It was my favorite class.
We went to this field trip once.
It was Copper Creek.
I mean, he practically broke down and
started crying, something about his wife.
We all sort of knew about it,
but he never really wanted to talk about it.
Faraday reportedly blamed the Bureau
for its role
in his wife's death almost three years ago.
Specifically, sources speculate his target
may have been Agent Whit Carver
one of the 184 people to perish in the attack.
Carver was the partner of Faraday's wife
at Copper Creek.
And Faraday may have
held him responsible.
All I know is what he told me
in his office one day after class.
You know, I'll never forget that. He said,
"Sweetheart, one day
those men are going to pay.
"One day, those men are going to burn."
Yet all of them described Faraday
as solitary, but friendly
as a talented professor
fascinated by the American underground.
And as a loving father to his 10-year-old son
who is now in the care of relatives.
After exhausting hundreds of thousands
of man-hours and leads,
federal investigators are finally ready to say
that just as in the St. Louis IRS bombing
nearly two years ago,
this spring's attack on the FBI, the worst
terrorist strike in our nation's history
was the work of one man
and one man alone.
Any news yet?
No. They'll let us know.
Someplace nice?
I hope.
Someplace safe.
