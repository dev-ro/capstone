And we want you to
know this has nothing.
Nothing at all.
To do with your performance.
Which is exemplary. By the way.
Look, The business is changed.
Marine salvage changed.
We don't need a submarine officer anymore.
We do not even need a submarine.
Now You have never been on contract.
So there will be no severance.
Its not a question.
I spoke to Bob
Torres personally,
and he insisted me to make sure
there is something for you.
I am please to say
that we can offer you a
settlement of 8,640 pounds.
Do got a pensión?
A private pensión?
I have worked for Augoura in 11 years.
I have worked in
submarines for nearly 30.
I lost my family to this job..
Please clear your desk.
Today.
So before your last employment
were you in the Navy for 15 years?
- Why did you leave?
- Disagree to someone.
It's some kind of fuck shit. All right.
Kurston, are you okay?
- You look rough.
- Ya, I know. Mmm...
put me on this tablets.
Antidepressants. And...
To the balance me out.
And drinking?
It helps.
I cant believe so bustards fired you.
I can't can't believe it.
It is a joke.
I mean. When they fired Kurston, Ok.
He is fat useless fuck. No of fence.
Yes of my heart...
Fire a man like you. Fuck shit.
They want me a flick burger.
Fuckers.
When I was young, all I
think about was sex.
Now I think only money.
There is nothing in this worid
without money. My friends
I saw Martin yesterday. My Boy.
He is twelve years old now.
So cross the road like..
Prestigious school, nice house.
He grows up in some rich fuck.
I have never even met.
How's Chris? How does she look?
Good. She looks good.
But you have to take this shit.
Donâ€™t have to take this shit..
What the fuck are you talking about?
I think I know way to...
not been like this.
I know a ways to get money.
Deaf looking money.
I can not do it...
I do not know enough.
I need you, Robinson. Need a man like you.
You can do it.
Just before Augoura fired me last
year, I went out to the Black Sea.
We found something.
You are late.
And you look like shit.
Where the fuck is Kurston?
He called me this morning. He's not coming.
- What do you mean he is not coming?
- He is sick.
He is sick?
God dammed it. Better have cancer.
Listen to me. Do exactly as I say.
Be nice..
Donâ€™t be a fucking idiot.
Elaborate nothing unless he ask. Donâ€™t
say anything that you don't have to. Ok.
Do not ask his name. And please
please what ever you do...
Do not ask how much he is
going to invest on us.
Sir, This is Robinson, the
man I told you about.
What is your name and how
much you going to invest in us?
So In 1941, Nazi Germany came close
to total financial collapse.
At that time the Soviets were neutral.
But Stalin was terrified that
Germany was going to invade. So
hitler useless this. And
demanded a loan from Russia.
80 million Reichsmark in gold.
Nobody knows what happen next. Because
we broke the truce and attack Russia.
Four years of war, 20 million dead.
But in the 50s there were rumors started
to circulated heights ranks of politburo.
that Stalin had complied with the request.
That Hitler had send a U-boat,
Stalin had it stuffed with 2 tons
of gold and it send on his way.
But the gold never arrived,
and Hitler invaded.
So everybody forgets about it.
But in the '80s a oceanic
research institute
found a series of shallow
ridges off the Georgian coast.
I worked for a company called
Augoura Marine Management.
They search for,
and salvages wrecks.
They found a U-boat
on one of these ridges.
Just 90 meters from the surface.
Thatâ€™s reachable..
Mr. Lewis,
they think it is the one.
In 2008 they took this information
to the Georgian government.
And they offered them a deal.
The Georgians agreed.
And?
And a month later there was Russian
and Georgian Conflict.
There were new bosses, and ownership
of the waters have been seen since.
The Russians do not even know subs there.
Georgians know exact location.
Augoura can not go into
conflict is resolved.
They tired up in paper
work in fucking politics.
Mean while submarine is sitting
on the seabed. Full of gold.
What do you want from me?
I need a submarine.
Blackie here have contacts
but it will cost
180,000.
And Man. I need man. Half british.
Half Russians.
It's a Russian submarine.
I take 40% of anything up to 4 million
dollars.
20% of anything above that.
Ok.
Kurston, it went well.
Give me a call back..
So How many do we need?
It is a Foxtrot submarine.
Need 12 men minimum. Ok... well
we got two of us and Kurston.
Then Reynolds and Peter.
They have both been in the navy.
And the Russians?
What Jusof, he is a good man.
Be drunk, Take Levchenko instead.
Levchenko. Zaytsev for engines.
And Baba by sonar.
He hears best in the Russian Navy.
The charts Morozov.
How do you get into boat?
With a remote-controlled drone?
No, the fleet is just please upstairs.
We use divers. Converts escape
compartment into a pressure chamber.
Sneak in and out.
Without someone seeing.
We need good divers for this.
Do you know Fraser?
I know Fraser. He is a psychopath.
Psychopath.
He is. But he is a incredible diver.
Half male, half fucking fish.
Gittens is pretty good in the water.
We gambling problem.
- What?
- Well. It was Lewis.
Iâ€™m going with you.
I fucking going with you.
I have claustrophobia.
I bet you are.
Hi, this is Mark Kurston.
Leave a message.
I will call back to you.
Kurston where the hell are you?
Call me.
Are you Robinson?
I am friend of mark heston. Hi.
He killed himself.

Do you work in submarines now? Reynolds.
No.
What do you do now? Paper rat.
Paper rat.
You laughing at me boy?
Sorry, I thought you were joking.
I was fired from my crappy job
the steelyard.
Fired by people like you. Bankers.
I am not actually banker. Gittens
has not worked in years.
Fraser smoking in and out of prison.
And Peters.
He does offices clean for assholes like
you.
I did not mean insult you.
Start loading.
Let's get Zaytsev started the engine.
Gittens with, he is good for diesel.
Levchenko, check out the electronics.
Can you get a door on the escape chamber?
- You fucking believe.
- Robinson, you cant be serious?
This wreck, This wreck will sink.
Fucking useless.
All panels. Off. On.
300 bar. 300th.
The hydraulics operational.
120 bar.
120 is a little voice. It is
usual at this age. 120 is.
The pump runs. What are you looking for?
The windows.
What?
I had to wash windows before ride.
Can I found any?
It is a submarine. There are no windows.
What is looking for?
There is no chimney, right?
No son, no chimney. Come here.
It is a good sign.
They like you. Store that.
What do you doing for me?
Batteries are not so great.
Gonna charge about 70%.
He says the diesel engine is good,
but the leaking diesel, he knows not where.
The drip by the mail turbine now.
Tell him to find and fix it.
Hey, robinson.
There is no escape suits.
And the radio...
It only one circuit works on.
We want be using the radio.
The Russian fleet is upon us.
Looking forward to sail out again.
Thank you being with me boss.
I am sorry to hear Chrissy left you.
She is a sweet girl. Sorry about that...
Thank you. Blackie? Yes, boss.
No escape suit. What that mean?
No escape suit means, no one escape.
If something happens, we have only
the radio. Donâ€™t worry banker.
I am not actually a banker.
Is it not immersión suits there?
Diving suits. - Put them in. If you got
in trouble we can use these escape suits.
Yes, you can definitely go 80 meters
out and come back with a short hose.
This is what a submarine.
Outside just dark, cold, death.
Gets the man thinking.
Think about what?
Going to think fucking die.
What are you laughing at. You
don't even speak English.
Yes?
The Russians are not
happy about Tobin.
They call him a virgin.
It's bad luck with virgins in the boat.
Jesus, He is 18 years old.
What 18 year old do you know,
now day's that's a virgin?
Its not matter. They call him a virgin.
So is he a virgin.
Unlucky.
Well. I do not give in to superstition.
Call everyone together.
They must know what is at stake.
How much gold were talking?
At least 40 million dollars.
Maybe a lot more.
Those bastards fired
the man you founded
kurstain.
He was a good man.
His life is this job, like rest of us here.
They fired him. He killed himself.
They fired me they fired man
line flushing shit down a toilet.
This time that shit is fighting back.
40% go to the man whose funding us.
Thatâ€™s Daniel's boss.
The rest...rest.
As ours.
Equal share every man.
Back to your posts.
We are leaving in an hour.
- Equal share? Jesus, why?
- Because they are risking their lives.
They would put it on the line for a fee.
Are they just have bread crumbs?
What are you talking about?
That has not...
What does have to do anything?
Listen, Robinson. Were going to
be on this sub. With these men.
And it is going to be full of Gold.
Right?
When they find out their
share gets bigger. Their is less people...
to share with.
Boss? We are ready.
Close in.
Open the main valves.
Yes, boss. Opens the main valves.
Over the helm.
10 down.
30 meters.
I bring it back to periscope.
30 meters up there, Boss.
Diving now. Diving now.
Zaytsev.
Zaytsev need someone to help
him get the press engine.
He gave him Tobin.
He is not work with Tobin, Bad luck.
Tell Zaytsev that must work with
Tobin or the get off my boat.
Tobin. Here. It will be OK.
Easy job. He finds leakage.
Spin the wheel.
Here.
In Russian, less.
In Russian, more.
He says less, turn valve left.
He says more, turn right.
Donâ€™t fuck this..
Which valves?
This one. One two three in, one two down.
Smaller, left. More, right.
One three down. No no..
One, two, three in.
One, two, three in. One two down.
One two down.
- Donâ€™t fuck this..
- I do not.
Enjoy..
It's fucking unfair,
that they get the same as us.
Everyone gets the even split.
2 million, is not that enough?
Are you kidding me, right? 2 million?
Where the guys are coming from. Earth Cave.
It is fucking 20 million to us.
They fucking laughing at us.
What did you do? What did you
just have a shit in the bowl?
Did you Levchenko? Is that what you did?
You shit in the bowl?
I work for them in the United
States for three months.
Is the food that...?
Fuck me the foods..
The food is incredible.
We talk fillets of beef.
Iâ€™m talking about Cooked ham. Chicken
with it all and gravy. Motherfucker.
And what do we get?
Levchenkos toilet in a bowl.
Oh, don't get me wrong, it is safe Gordon
Ramsey home with you. But you know.
What is your problem?
What are you doing? Take it easy.
They laugh at us.
Come one in?
You've been staring at it for days now.
Why is that?
Is it from your girlfriend there?
She's not my girlfriend.
Do not like the girl, she is pregnant.
I do not know her.
Terrifying, isn't?
Donâ€™t worry son..
You return home as a rich man.
The boy will lack nothing.
The boy?
- I told them, you were virgin.
- Iâ€™m not a fucking virgin.
- Have you said, I was...
- Quiet.
Engine. 360 meters forward.
Russian torpedo fighter.
West, northwest, 20 knots.
280 meters.
200 meters.
It passes. Heading south.
It is gone.
Continue with three knots for one
hour, then proceed as normal.
Baba, you are pure gold.
Hiding from our own people.
that was tense..
Tense..
Not even "speak
English" in Russian.
How do you keep it out here?
Even couple of days In a few days.
How to keep it from outside.
No, it's my baby.
It is? It makes sense.
- Do you see? We are all penguins.
- Penguins?
Throw them in the water and see them.
So graceful..
Elegant and strong.
I knows exactly what it doing.
But up in the country,
what do you have there?
Just a great ride, just a
waddling ride. Penguin.
What do you going to do with your share?
Stupid to spend money you do not have.
Certainly pay some debt.
Give something to the wife and kids.
I also expect child.
A boy. I spoil him wildly.
Two million is not much these days.
What is going on.
Are you confused or something?
Take it easy. What fuck are you doing?
This is our side.
Hey you, don't pee yourself.
You know what they're trying to do, don't
you? To get that boy to kill himself.
So they get a bigger share.
Shut the fuck up.
We are just above the submarine.
Blackie.
The leak is found. But there
must be drained before repairs.
- Takes 4:00 to 5:00 hours.
- We are on top of the submarine now.
We must use diesel to charge
batteries before we go deep anyway.
Get repairs done first.
Listen. Some of your people
have funny ideas with money.
- They think the Russians get too much.
- Everyone gets the even split.
Okay?
- What is going on?
- It's mine. Its my numbers just come up.
I won 30,000. He says,
we bought them together. But no.
Yeah and so we got do something
about these fucking guy's.
Please! Skipper.
Cause there already
fucking taking too much.
And now they are trying to muscle
in and fucking and rip us off!
They're just trying to find
way's to take more and more.
- What is it you do not understand?
- How do you know your numbers came up?
Have you been on our radio?
Have you talked to the fucking radio?
We are just under the Black Sea fleet.
We are under the fucking...
Not the radio. You killed
the fucking radio.
Give me that ticket..
Give me that ticket.
You risked our lives for 30 thousand.
30 thousand.
All you Listen to me.
Every man gets equal share.
Every man!
Any one who doesn't like it.
Is in dangering this vessel.
Any man dangering this vessel,
goes out fucking tubes.
I told you. I fucking told you.
Tell them deal is changed.
They divide us along for the money.
Listen Robinson...
Get your hand off me.
Just... Just listen to me.
Be careful with this.
I know I know.
One down...
I'm sorry.
Iâ€™m sorry.
More to the right, lower left.
Idiot. Let him be.
Fuck you., are you Russian pretty
fucking tough with the kid. Arenâ€™t you?
I expected more from you.
With this?
Why would you attack him with it?
- You might just try.
- Give me the knife. Give me the knife.
Give me the knife!
Jesus. What have you do?
What have you done?
Do you work three months again?
- Dad lives on a boat.
- Dad working on a boat.
Father lives on a boat.
Persuade him not now.
I can see him. I'm with him.
He is not just a photograph.
Thatâ€™s why you left me?
It has nothing to do with his great
house to do or his fat car.
Chrissy Wait..
- How long was I gone?
- About eighteen hours.
The Russians have gone berserk.
I had to threaten them with
a flare gun to hold them off.
The engine drive shaft is broken.
It happened in the explosión.
Our ballast tanks are ruptured.
I think we have about 36 hours.
The Russians have almost all the water,
up at the other end of the boat.
We go the food. It will have
and they want us gone.
Quiet, you.
Animals.
You have killed a lot, Fraser.
You have killed fucking all of us.
Are we going to die down here?
No way.
Morozov.
I'm not armed.
What are you saying?
You speak English?
Why did not you say anything before?
No one speak me, I don't speak them.
I say...
I can make this boat work.
From here to here. Which means
we are one one of these..
We should be in between one of the two
hills otherwise we will be crushed. Right.
If we are at this hill, we must be
right next to the submarine.
This submarine is based on the same
submarine designs.
So we find the submarine and
go in and take the drive shaft.
If it has been in the water for 17 years,
it's useless now.
No, Black Sea
oxygen deficient at the depth.
No oxygen. No decay.
There are perfect preserved
Roman costumes out there...
look, we go in there, take the drive shaft,
make it clear and put it in to the engine.
- We get this boat here off seabed.
- This boat is dead.
- We can not take it.
- We are not going to sail it.
We are going into take it to the
surface, and boarding the lifeboats.
- What if we are too far off?
- Then we all fucking dead.
Even if the boat is fixed.
We don't have enough men.
We have enough man to move boat.
We have enough. Right now We need Baba.
Sonars are broken. We do not know
even what way it lies.
Baba is there behind it.
When he killed Blackie,
they wanna a kill him.
They wanna kill everyone.
They go crazy now.
We have to have Baba.
And Zaytsev.
And Fraser. He dead is not forgotten.
But we have to have every
one to get this boat up.
We live together or die together.
One of you has to go talk to him.
Go now, while there is a chance.
I believe we have found
out that it is no good...
We can not have the equal
lying around. Fraser...
put them out to the tubes.
- Yes, boss.
- Do it decently.
I got him.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Now they come.
Ready? Roger.
We are ready.
- Set the time.
- In progress.
Stop!
- Come on.
- Go.
- Stop.
- Stop.
When we got up on top. I am
going to eat your liver.
Yes, we do.
You are out there well with me, right?
You have dived before.
But from years ago.
Fucking at, look at me.
I'll look after you.
I promise. Look after you.
Morozov, I have an idea
landscape, but it is vague.
Baba thinks something
rises up from the seabed.
About 100 meters away, maybe
40 meters wide.
It could be the submarine, which
places us here.
100 meters from the submarine,
thatâ€™s close enough.
We can reach that.
Or it could be a small hill.
Which means we are here.
On the other ridge.
Baba says he can be more precise
but it will take time. Maybe days.
I need a hospital...
Daniels. Shut up..
We do it now. If we are in the
other ridge we all dead anyway.
What about the other diver?
Cant do with two..
I need another diver.
Diving any of your?
Come on. I am ears.
I'll do it.
I have scubadykket
with youth club.
Close this here.
Stay close to Fraser,
he knows what he's doing.
There is only enough oxygen to do this one.
Make sure that the rows.
- It is quite dark.
- Relax and you gonna following me.
I am here. Just jump.
Come down quiet slowly. Its all right.
Jesus...
just Stay calm and
take a breath.
Stay with me. I have never lost
the man out here. All right.
Good. Lets go.
Then light up, although the
difference.
- Stop the piberi.
- It's my lung disease.
It sounds fucking like a death rattle.
Skip, We are ready moving out.
Ok. Look after yourself.
Good luck.
What is the seabed like?
Miles of dark shit.
Grab his hand!
Tobin, are you okay?
What happened?
- Tobin?
- Fraser!
Fraser, help me!
Iâ€™m in the fucking edge!
Pull me up.
Quiet. I got you. I got you.
Blackie smoke right past me.
What happened? Come in.
We found the edge...
Is anyone hurt?
Can we carry on?
Tobin gonna wash his
underwear, but we are okay.
Lets keep going..
Peter, how you doing?
Almost finished.
Oh, no..no no.
- What is it?
- Ground. The ground rising.
- We are on the hill.
- Are you sure?
- Are you sure?
- Yes, its rising straight up.
We have been wrong. It's not here.
We are on the wrong ridge.
I have... Hello.
What? Say again. What?
I have found it!
I have found the submarine! Its here.
Under the mud. Well done. Lad.
Ears... - in the fucking mud.
There is air in here.
- Can we take the helmets of?
- Donâ€™t do that.
The air is turned into gas.
It burn your lungs out of second.
Come. Its good.
My goodness.
We knew there would be equal.
Why is he strapped?
Is it a prison?
No. It's a prison son.
Cannibalism.
Let us find what we came for. Come on.
Is it get a work?
Peter, your fuck! Will it work?
They are virtually the same.
Tobin, help him get it out.
I'll be back in a minute.
Wait...
My goodness.
My goodness.
- Are you there?
- Fraser?
We drive shaft.
I loader it now.
No, listen to me.
I must be very careful.
It is our way out of here.
We are ready.
Bring her in, slow & steady.
In order.
Move it.
Come on. Push.
The wire pulls with nearly four tons.
- What's going on?
- The just need a little help.
It moves. Its moving now.
What's going on?
Why is it so heavy?
They have the gold.
It's too heavy.
- This is what we came for.
- I serious.
We must at least try.
Robinson, Robinson.
We lose the drive shaft with fuck.
Better to lose the gold.
Keep coming.
The jammed.
I am fine now.
Continue forward!
There we go.
- Fraser!
- Keep pushing.
- It must clear the rock.
- Fraser, we must stop.
- Throw away the gold.
- Can you keep it coming Fraser.
We must continue, otherwise
we never started in the gene.
- We lose everything.
- Pull to the left.
What happens? Can we keep coming?
Your call. Can we keep coming?
- It is our lives.
- We continue.
The case now. Stay with me.
Dragging this way. Come on.
Harder. Harder.
We're almost there. It will be fine.
We'll be fine.
Hold on! Come on, now.
The gold of smoking. Wait.
How to.
- Throw the damn gold.
- Move away!
Get this one under.
Gently. You must be careful.
We just have the obstacle.
- Grab him!
- Fraser!
Ohh shit. What was that? No no o..
Say something.
It's right there.
- What's it look like?
- A large pile of gold.
I thought he could handle it.
Otherwise, I had not asked him.
- Do we get it?
- What for?
Its millions of dollars in gold..
So what?
- Explains you to the Russian fleet?
- Would you just leave it?
Thatâ€™s exactly What I want. What
else we going to do with it.
If you want to ask, how many
required to operate the submarine?
Sailing?
We must not sail. We must be up.
Shut - Morozov!
Do not interpret. We sail not.
We have to get up!
In this condition, we can make
it with nine men.
And I was eight.
No, I am not...
We need to talk to you. Alone.
Now.
Right, ok. Iâ€™m going to
tell you something.
I'm just a guy who
working for someone.
- It was not my idea.
- Say what you have to say.
Your not giving anything.
It was never intended.
- What are you talking about?
- Who do you think you funded?
- Lewis. The man in the big house,
- Augoura, your old company.
- We met Lewis together.
- Lewis does not exist.
It was just an actor. It was all arranged.
There is no Lewis.
Augoura took the ass on you.
Why do you think they fired you?
When you come up to the surface, they will
arrest you for Merchant Shipping Act.
They have already made agreements
with Georgian markets.
They just needed labor.
No, you bastard.
Kurston told me where it was.
- How could they know?
- He told you this in a pub -
On 18 July.
We paid him $ 30,000.
I'm sorry robinson.
I took Tobin with.
- He's just a boy.
- Okay.
- Men are dead.
- It was never part of the plan.
I have apologized.
Take it. Tie the door firmly.
It keeps you might alive
if they get past me.
- I will kill you!
- Get him to fall down!
Get the fuck out of our way robinson.
- He must die. Now.
- So what?
We go up and we entrust the gold.
- They are waiting for us.
- Yes, they are.
East, so we do not go east.
We go south. Samsun.
The northern Turkey.
Miles from anywhere.
- It's 100 miles from here.
- There is deserted coves, I know.
- We should go up.
- Morozov.
Morozov.
- Can you lead us to Samsun?
- Yes, I have the charts.
I know this place robinson.
It is the poor water.
- There is low.
- So we sail around the low.
- Baba listen your way.
- We can not recharge the batteries.
There is a raft on top.
We will not make it.
- How long will it take?
- Fourteen hours.
- Twelve to fourteen hours.
- They do not let us get away.
Turks have a naval base in Trabzon.
20 km up the coast.
They sail barely into the Turkish navy.
Fuck that.
Fucking that shit!
Iâ€™m gonna fucking kill him. Iâ€™m going to
do it now, - all right, you can do that.
You can kill him, you can do that...
Or we can go up.
We can live and We can breathe clean air.
But if we do...
So may you continue your life as before,
crawling around on the stomach.
For fuckers like him!
People who get scum like us to
to do their work.
People who get us to
make them fucking rich.
I'm not going home poor..
Not after this.
- The ship is in bad condition.
- A half a day.
Half a day.
