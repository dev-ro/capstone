Yeah, what's up?

[Voice on speaker]
All seat belts checked. All clear.
No! Ah, oh!
So, what?
[Interviewer] What do you think
of Astroworld so far?
It's one of the best albums of all time.
The new one with me and Frank Ocean is...
a very... different piece.
I feel like, at some points in life,
you have to just be extreme.
And sometimes, you have to take...
all matters to the extreme.
Astro was a concept
I've been working on since...
I was about six years old.
I feel that...
it's some of the best moments of my life.
[Excited yells]
At moments, I feel that...
that these were times
that you have to really...
- [friend] Oh, God.

[Travis]
I'm not done with these niggas, man.
I'm not done with these niggas.
Watch out.
I'm trying to feel the love. Watch out.
Open up, man! Goddamn!
I don't wanna see nobody near me.
Everybody back up!
Open up! Open this shit up!
Where the fuck my ragers at?
Y'all niggas get in control, man. Back up!
[Crowd shouting]

You will see a lot of crowd surfers
in general,
but also a lot of kids
are just trying to get out
to safety 'cause they can't breathe,
it's so compact.
You won't know how bad it could be

of the way...
You know... from the first time
he sent me one of his mixtapes
when I was, like, at school
and just seeing that, like, into...
what it is now... I always knew, you know?
It was just the process
of getting everybody else
to figure that out.
[Girl] Jack!
[Guy] I can't find him.

Man, it's going so fast.

He knows what the kids like,
and he knows how to make the kids feel
a part of what he's doing.
...and say, "Yo, you're gonna make it big
one day."
Look where he is now.
[Travis] I'm a fan of seeing the fans.
Like, yeah. That's like a show, in my--
Just seeing people rock left to right,

[radio] Rapper Travis Scott
wrapping up an unforgettable weekend
in Houston.
His sold-out Astroworld Festival
on Saturday received rave reviews.
Therefore I, Sylvester Turner,
mayor of the city of Houston,
hereby proudly proclaim
November 18th, 2018
as Astroworld Day, Travis Scott Day!
[Cheering]
[Travis] I grew up here my whole life.
I was inspired by AstroWorld.
In '05, when they took it away...
it kinda took a big piece
of my heart away.
I didn't have anywhere to go.
So, I just wanted to kinda bring back
that feeling
and give this city
something they could always have,
just fun to do.
It's been hurricane after hurricane,
disaster after disaster,
they try to take us away, but...
as long as we stick together and create,
we don't need nothing special.
We got each other...
Man, at 10, 12, y'all right here, like...
Y'all hold the future. It don't seem
like it, 'cause you can't drive,
don't have a driver's license, but yeah.
[Laughter]
Just use all the time that you can't go
to the parties and the clubs
to really start working on your future.
It's lit!
[Cheering]
Huge for Houston and huge for Mo City.
Huge for Travis, man.
This is crazy.
[Lady calls out] How are you?
I'm so proud of you!
Look at you!
So, all that cursing out I did
- in my office worked, huh?
- It must've.
- Look at you!
- Jack, look!
[Screams in surprise]
Hey, yo!
I couldn't graduate school...
- unless it was for this girl right here.
- Yes, you could've.
This lady. Oh, my God.
She saved my life...
in high school. Like, real life.
Bro, I remember she came in my room.
It was like, "You passed! Whassup?"
[Sarah] I remember that.
- [Mum] Y'all called me.
- [Sarah] I called, yeah.
[Mum] And she told me.
She told me he was gonna be somebody.
- She told me that!
- [Lady] Yeah, she did.
[Lady] Look at you!
I remember that day when you told me that,
you know what? This high school was just--
I just can't turn this music off.
I remember that.
I just can't turn it off!
[Guy] I saw him on the Days Before Rodeo
tour with Thug and Metro,
and we started out at the fucking
small-ass venues,
and then it's just intensified.
Man, you created Astroworld
and this tour, bro.
To see you go from opening shows
and no one knowing you...
[Travis] The pyro dude can just go home
if he not gon' hit the fucking button.
I want you to go through
your light cues, make sure you're cool.
You have the music,
and we can continue doing that.
Then that's what we do.
So, I'm gonna let go of the departments
that aren't--
- Nuh-uh.
- All right. Cool.
Everyone's right here till I go
through this shit, and I'm--
I have yet to feel comfortable, bro.
- Okay, cool.
- From first song to last.
Before I go home, lay down, I wanna do it.
Before we go on tomorrow, I'm straight.
Until then, nobody leaves.
[Crew] We've been at the Garden before
on other people's tours, but...
never had the whole house.
[Girl] I'm excited to see
how lit the crowd gets.
I wanna see, like,
the audience moving up and down.
My 19th time seeing Travis live.
I'm trying to stage dive
off the fucking nosebleeds tonight.
Let's fucking go. Astroworld, baby!
Fit of the Year, man.
[Guy off-camera] Tonight. Sold out.
Roller coasters. We back at it again,
but this time it's your fucking spotlight,
your stage, your show.
We need La Flame tonight.
- La Flame!
- Yessir.
[Kylie] Dada?
- Come here.
- Say bye.
[Press] Madison Square Garden,
the world's most famous arena.
[Press] Travis Scott, sold out.
Why weren't you here?
Astroworld,
that's where you needed to be!
[Fan] And in the mosh pit...
you're in there,
you just have so much adrenaline.
- Astroworld in this bitch, what's up!
- Let's fucking go!
[Fan] I mean, it's fucking terrifying.
I'll never ever forget this day.
[Guy yells] It's time to rage!
[Fan] It was a dream, man, seeing Travis.
[Fan] I was on a ride with Travis Scott.
He's been my idol since I was 13...
[Travis] Everybody put one in the air

When the kids are on the roller coaster,
and I'm on the stage,
the roller coaster needs to be lit.
You're still not lighting the base!
There's no point if--
If I can't see them from where I'm at,
nobody can see 'em.
These lights
along the roller coaster rails,
I don't get no action.
These lights on the side,
I'm not getting no action!
It's the same shit.
It's not making sense.
Who does the camera?
- The director.
- Okay. On "Stop Trying to Be God,"
it needs to be front and center.
All that side shit is lame.
You exposing how the shot is doing--
That's lame!
It's like, nothing from behind.
It needs to be all center.
All front. Like,
unless I'm moving out the way, all front.
And on the jumbotrons, the second

needs to be on the All-stream.

Get that motherfucker up!
It just be sitting there.
I be talking because I'm waiting on it
to go up.
I can't start the song
'cause I can't do pyro if it's down.
- You get what I'm saying?
- [Crew] We were going off song cue,
and something's changed--
Fuck the song cue!
As soon as you see them buckle up
and that ladder's going...
Roller coaster up!
Gotta know how to adapt.
If one department fall,
another department gotta shine harder.
Like, if lasers go out,
lighting gotta tap in.
You know what I'm saying?
Be prepared for the moment
'cause I can't be instructing on stage.
I look crazy.
That's it.
All right, cool.
Other than that, it was cool.
Hey! We going rah!
[Music starts playing]
[Travis] I'm trying to design
that new Houston sound.
Where people can go out
and have something to parade with.
There's mad kids out there like me,
like Don Toliver,
who's on the album and shit. You know...
It's just vicious.
- That nigga came in hot.
- Yessir.
We heard Don Toliver for the first time,
- maybe, what, like four, five months ago?
- Man.
This kid is, like,
he thinking on some whole other shit.
You know what I mean?
I just gravitated to that.

[Don] Cactus Jack,

I'm from Houston, and you know,
I'm a fan of Travis, of course,
you know, and...
My manager reached out to Johno,
you what I'm saying?
And, you know, we just vibed,
and you know, he really believed in me.
Travis just took heed to it, man, and...
Either way it goes,
he called me to the studio, and...
all of a sudden, we get to the door.
My nigga asked me, "You ready?"
I looked at him. I said, "Yo,
I'm ready. What's up?"
Opened that door,
and that music was rushing out.

[Newsreader] Travis Scott was confirmed
as part of the Super Bowl halftime show,
which is happening in just a few weeks.
Of course, he was hit
with a ton of backlash,
but as we told you on Monday,
- Travis required...
- [newsreader 2] ...when the rumors were
that Travis Scott was gonna do this,
obviously Travis Scott knew
what he was getting into.
He knew the controversy...
[newsreader 3]
Travis's addition came with a stipulation.
Michael B. Jordan,
and the Reverend Al Sharpton, and others
voiced their disapproval
of Scott's choice.
[Akon] You gotta walk gingerly.
Cultural equity, at the end of the day.
As a people, we compromise
in certain situations
to get to better places.
[Reporter] Is it blown out of proportion?
Yes, because, honestly,
why wouldn't a black artist
want to not perform
in one of the biggest events in the world?
That don't help us!
We need you to be on that stage!
[Travis] How many of these you did?
- This is my 11th Super Bowl.
- Damn!
You did this with Beyoncé?
Did it with Beyoncé.
That was in New Orleans.
That was great.
Prince was... amazing.
Damn.
- And now Travis Scott.
- [Announcer] Three, two, one.
[Pyrotechnics boom]
You know on that drum? The breakdown?
The tch-tch?
- Yeah.
- That shit just sound corny, man.
[Commentator] Looks like
this might've been his first year.
I mean, he was good at football and track.
He could have done something
in those sports.
- All right, Jack!

[Kid] Run, Junior! Run, Junior, run!
Legs up.

Yeah! There you go.

[Dad] He was a little boy.
Shit, I don't know.
About five or six, seven.
But the training wheels weren't on
at age six, seven.
Actually, I was up there on my job.
And I filmed him,
and he still couldn't figure out
how to ride.
Turn around, Junior.
And I came back home, and he was riding.
That's crazy.
Golly.
Proud of him.
Yessir!
Yessir!
[Energetic drumming]
- Hey man.
- Nice to meet you.
Just met your parents, man.
You know, boy, they're so proud of you.
[Travis] Sorry, man.
I was trying to bring one home.
After Sunday, I've been mentally, like,
stressed. I've been down.
I've been questioning.
I don't know, man. I lost, man.
I don't know, man.
- But you didn't lose.
- I'm torn, man.
But, nah. But look,
you're looking at somebody...
I ran for mayor three times.
- Lost the first two times.
- Okay.
- Okay? But the way I look at it,
- Okay.
- Wasn't my defeat.
- Yeah.
- Keep coming.
- Yeah.
[Sylvester] So, you know,
you didn't lose, man.
So get that out your head,
and let that go.
Because you gotta tell folks
that sometimes you don't get
what you want,
- but you don't stop.
- Yeah.
See?
Now's the time you can tell that story.
'Cause a lot of these folks
that's listening to you tonight,
they gone after shit,
- and they didn't make it.
- Yeah.
They need a person like you to tell them,
- "It ain't over."
- Facts.
[Sylvester] And I can say it,
- it ain't gonna resonate as much.
- Yeah.
You could say it.
People listen to you.
[Interviewer] They were saying you got
a lot of requests to do a new theme park?
Yeah.
- That's because of his Astroworld.
- Yeah.
And now, folk are on me to...
to create and bring a theme park
- back to the city of Houston.
- Yessir.
Because of Astroworld.
Man, that'd be fucking crazy.
[Sylvester] That'll be your Grammy,
when I put that Astroworld theme park
in the city.
Exactly.
- That's a fact.
- And I gotta find them new Jordans
that are all sold out.
