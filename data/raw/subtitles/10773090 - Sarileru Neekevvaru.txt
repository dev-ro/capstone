Good morning, ma’am.
- Good morning… Sit down.
Collect and package the remaining
samples in seperate bundles.
Take additional samples at distance
of 1, 10, 25 and 50 feet.
Hey!
Excuse me, ma’am.
He is misbehaving with me.
Get up.
What have you done?
I just pinched her because
she looks good, ma’am.
Are you drunk?
Actually, I was drunk last night.
I’m still hung over from that.
Get out of my class.
Excuse me, ma’am...
Principal sir wants to see you.
Tell me, sir.
I was told you suspended him
because he was drunk in class.
This is his father.
He’s a dear friend of the establishment.
Excuse him for now.
I’m surprised that you
are taking it so easy.
He was drunk, sir.
He’s pursuing medicine.
A mistake in his line of work
costs someone their life.
I'm sorry, sir.
Listen…
We belong to the same city.
It’s not just the kids
who roam around drunk.
Even truck drivers are often on booze.
Watch out.
This is what you’re supposed to do
when your son commits a mistake.
Not throw complaints and threats.
In my 15 years of
professional career...
I have never accepted
anything that is wrong.
When it was wrong, I told it as it is.
And I will continue to do so.
Now if you may...
Give me a dozen apples
I need Gilly flowers and chrysanthemum
- Hello, ma’am.
- Hello.
Why did you skip tuition yesterday?
Err... I went to watch a movie, ma’am.
From tomorrow onwards,
you’ll help your dad during the day.
And attend tuition during the night. Okay?
- Alright. Bye, ma’am.
- Bye.
When is the groom’s side arriving, uncle?
They will be here in 30 minutes, dear.
- Give it to me.
- Father…
- The material for rituals...
- Give it to your sister.
You aren’t supposed to use
your left hand during auspicious events.
It’s okay, uncle. He’s left-handed.
Mom...
- Go get ready quickly. Go!
- Okay.
You nurtured three beautiful kids despite
being a single mom.
You’re raising an abandoned kid
as your own.
You’ve got a really big heart.
Only someone who knows pain
comes forward to help.
Mom, how do I look?
Looks like you inherited the house
from your grandparents.
Brother-in-law, is the roof made of tiles?
Care to tell me?
Hey! Shut up, will you?
I heard your elder son was
martyred in the army.
Poor woman! Your daughter-in-law became
a widow at such a young age.
How could you still send your
younger son to the army?
Nowadays patriotism has become
a fancy thing, brother-in-law.
What do your kids do?
The value of rupee is dropping by day.
So my elder son is in UK,
making pounds.
And my younger son is
making dollars in the US.
While your kids are away...
I’ve sent my kids to the border
to guard your house.
You see the value of a country
in its currency.
I see it in the waving flag.
And we are all proud to be
a soldier’s family.
Hey! You go and sit in the car.
- Brother-in-law...
- Go!
Okay.
Please ignore him...
We wanted this alliance after getting
to know your family history.
Priest, fix a date and time.
This 14th is a really auspicious day.
Fix that date.
I’ll ask my son to return at the earliest.
Major Ajay Krishna, come in.
Bomb squad required immediately.
- Everything is under control, sir.
- Aim right there.
Traffic is diverted to different routes.
Hey, Singh… Come here.
We’ve located the bomb 30 minutes ago.
But we can’t do anything about it
until he arrives.
When will your Major reach?
Sir...
- Is everything under control?
- Yes, sir.
- Did you clear the crowd?
- Yes, sir.
If you find anyone looking suspicious
with a mobile phone, just shoot him.
Good morning, sir!
You don’t have to call me sir
if you’re so uncomfortable.
You can call me Ajay,
considering we’re good friends.
- Morning,son.
- Yes... Morning, Mr. Prasad.
What's going on?
We’re not gathered at a family party.
There’s a bomb here.
Everyone is worried as
to when it will explode.
We can take it slow.
Let’s have a cup of coffee first.
You want to have coffee now?
- But the bomb...
- What’s the big deal?
We cleared the area.
Only both our lives are at risk.
Your hands are shivering from the cold.
If you cut the wrong wire by mistake...
Boom! It'll explode!
We’ll both die and our souls
will float in the air together.
Aren’t you going to leave
my soul alone at least?
If my soul asks you, ‘Mr. Prasad, you didn’t
even let me have a cup of coffee first’
What is your soul’s answer going to be?
You don’t have to go that far
for a cup of coffee.
Increase the flame.
Pour the milk in.
Who’s going to add sugar, huh?
Why don’t you make it yourself?
You carry on, dear.
It is great fun to supervise over
some other director’s film.
If it’s a hit, we can take total credit.
But if it flunks,
we can give him the entire credit.
That coffee was a
blockbuster, Mr. Prasad.
You know Mr. Prasad here
is terrified of bombs.
Why don’t you put your
bomb suit on for safety?
Safety? I don’t know. It will be
suffocating if at all I die in there.
I want to die in peace. Come on.
Listen. Nothing is going to change.
I’m not taking my suit off for you.
Hey! You’re opening it like
it’s some rice bag.
Ah, come on, Mr. Prasad!
We planted and dismantled quite
a few of these.
Look... At least respect my opinion,
considering my age and our friendship.
I caught him, sir. I got him.
It’s him, sir… Kill him.
He was running, sir.
I struggled hard to catch him.
It’s him, sir! It’s him.
- What’s the confusion, Singh?
I can’t make out who it is
amongst the two.
Hey, are you doing this
with proof or as a fluke?
Mr. Prasad, when this guy was running,
he first stepped into mud.
Look at his shoe.
When he turned around the corner, the blue
paint on the wall got on to his shirt.
Look at the blue paint. Not me.
True.
Prasad, they are our juniors…
You are a senior…
You need to be vigilant.
You can't just go into it blindly.
Sir, we need to go to the camp.
What’s so urgent?
We have a celebrity
interaction in the evening.
Is Singh blushing?
So it is definitely some heroine.
Who is it?
- Actually, sir...
- Stop curling up and tell me who it is.
It’s Tamannaah, sir.
Come on! Clap!
Hello, ma'am.
We have a celebrity interacting
with us every year.
This year we have the very gorgeous,
Tamannaah Bhatia.
Good evening, guys.
You are our inspiration.
There's nothing I can do
differently to inspire you.
So I'll answer your questions.
Miss Tamannaah, tell us
something about the army.
You guys are the real heroes.
Tamannaah, what do you
love to do the most?
What do I love to do the most...?
Dance.
Hey, Singh...
She loves dance, man.
Miss Tamannaah, shall we have a dance?
Done!
I'll dance with the real heroes tonight!
Hello!
"There's a party in my house tonight"
"Join us"
"There's a party in my house tonight"
"Don't miss it for the world"
"There's a party in my house tonight"
"Don't miss it for the world"
"I'll call a DJ and rock the bass"
"Ill pump the speakers as
we rock the dance floor"
"Is it going to be peppy and kicking?
"is it going to be jolly?
If so, we are all for it"
"Let's party with a song"
"We'll remember it life long"
"Let's party with this song"
"We'll remember it life long"
"1...2...3...4...
Get on the dance floor"
"Let's groove to this mass-y music"
"Let's have a fun ride as the
guitar strings play out loud"
"I can sense a wild fire between us"
"With the beats of disco in a dim light"
"Let this night end on a high note"
With shots to drink and hugs to share
"Let's lighten up the
party environment"
"Let's party with this song"
"We'll remember it life long"
"Let's party!!!"
"Time to get yourself a little naughty"
"One more time!"
“Let’s party… Let's party with this song"
"We'll remember it life long"
"Let's party with this song"
"We'll remember it life long"
- Hello.
- Hello.
Can I speak to Ajay, please?
Ajay sir...! There's a call for you.
A call for me? Who is it?
Your mother, sir.
There must be a new joinee with that name.
Check again. -Okay, sir.
Mother… That word feels
good to hear it.
It would have been
great if I had a mother.
Loneliness is a battle.
We have to keep fighting it.
Hello, mom.
I’ve been trying to
reach you since 3 days.
I finally managed to get you on call.
Unexpectedly, I'm here at
the new regiment today.
I confirmed that alliance for sister.
He’s a really good guy.
Sister is really lucky, mom.
Don’t worry about the expenses.
I’ve got it all figured.
- How is she?
- She is very happy,
- When are you coming home?
- I’m going to apply for leave right away!
I just hope this wedding changes
her life for the better.
I'm very happy, mother.
I'll come back home
as soon as possible.
Sir.
- Show me that footage.
- Yes, sir.
Release our captive
that you're holding.
You have one day time.
If you try to act smart…
I’ll kill these kids brutally.
The one in the mask is Wasim Mohamed.
From the 'Mujahudin’ group.
Alright. So we have two options now.
Meet their demands and have
the kids released.
Or else, we go with
the rescue operation.
We’ve been trying to catch him
for quite a while now.
He is the big fish.
It’s a delicate issue, sir.
If something happens to the children,
it’ll be more problematic.
In that case, we could negotiate
with him one more time.
This is not a vegetable market
to bargain for lives.
We are the Indian Army and we
have the guts to bring them down.
Sorry, sir. Please allow me to do this.
I’ll get those kids back unharmed, sir.
That’s like my boy Ajay.
Go ahead.
Boys! Are you ready for the operation?
-Yes, sir!
- Right now!
- Yes, sir.
At sharp 8'o clock...
Indian Army bullet will
pierce through his head.
Move!
Have a cup of coffee and
watch it live, sir.
It’s a great visual when
the kids come out smiling.
Come on boys! Move it! Move it!
Move it boys, come on!
Point to right side balcony
and take the shot.
I can’t shoot, sir.
There will be a loud sound
if he falls on the car.
Just take the shot.
8 members in the ground floor
And 8 members in the balcony.
Four of you cover me.
- Sir...
- Singh... Take out the Skateboard.
- Sir.
First floor clear, sir.
- Move.
Sir...
I guess this is the only way in, sir.
I think we are stuck.
There must be a way.
Just wait for some time.
Where the hell are you hiding, cowards?
Show yourself!
Indian Army! Indian Army!
You fancy being the heroes, huh?
Show yourself.
Why are you hiding like cowards?
Show yourself!
Singing ‘Hum Tum Ek
Kamre Mein Bandh Ho’
Why is he singing songs
like Mohammad Rafi?
Show yourself if you're manly enough!
Why are you hiding like a bunch of losers?
Come on out!
I’ll kill each and every one of you.
Show yourself!
It's a trap!! Ajay!!
Ajay! Ajay!
- Take him out now!
- Sir...
Call for the medical support immediately.
-Okay, sir.
Take him out now!
Come on! Come on!
Do you read me, Ajay?
Yes, sir.
Ajay, do you need some extra force?
Do you read me?
No need, sir... I’ll step out with
all the kids like I promised.
Just wait and watch, sir.
How did you like my gift?
We have a present for you actually.
I’ve decided to shoot
everyone instead of just you.
I can’t hear you.
Major ‘Silly Cat’...
Major ‘Silly Cat’… Meow!
He’s not a silly cat, man.
Look... The lion is here.
Farooq, kill the kids!!!
What else?
You cussed me and I shot you for it.
Oh man! You cussed me real bad.
You got my mother into this.
But do you know why I
didn’t cuss your mother?
Because I respect your mother too.
Sir, he is severely injured and
the chances are very less.
A solider from that family has already
died for the country before.
Unfortunately, his brother is
in a critical condition now.
He met me just 2 days back and told
me about his sister’s wedding.
Sir, my sister is getting
married in 10 days.
I’ll be really happy if
you grant my leave.
My mom and sister are really
excited about the wedding.
According to the rules,
we need to inform them immediately.
But that may cancel his sister's wedding.
His whole family might be disturbed.
If we follow morale, one of us could attend
the wedding and tell them post the wedding.
Sir, rules or morale?
If you ask me, I would say morale.
One of us should attend the wedding
and tell the mother smoothly.
It’s the least we can do for a family
that’s sacrificed so much for the country.
There is no meaning to his bravery.
Sir, now the question is, on
behalf of the Indian Army...
Who will take this responsibility?
That’s like my boy Ajay.
I know only you can do it.
Only you can make it happen.
So Ajay... You've got to go tomorrow.
Remember to keep me posted.
And… Take someone with you
if you need to.
No... I'm not going with you.
Thanks for accepting, Mr. Prasad.
The next 10 days are going
to be so exciting.
That's what worries me.
I was terrified to
dismantle a bomb with you.
How can I make it through
10 days with you?
By the way, which place
are we going to?
[chanting prayers]
"Master is the Creator, Lord and Almighty!
I bow to you, My Master!"
Master... You took retirement
to lead a peaceful life.
Do you know why I brought you along?
What the hell did you
teach us in school?
What did you tell me when you made me
squat in front of the entire class?
‘Harm others and karma will pay back”
-I’ve harmed so many people.
But I’m doing absolutely fine.
I became an MLA.
What did you tell me when you
made me stand under the sun?
‘A pen is mightier than a sword.’
-I used a sword and became the Minister.
You taught all the wrong stuff
and looted fee from my father.
You ruined my childhood.
I brought you here to show you
what true knowledge is.
Oh.
Why are you still talking to him?
Put him down, chop off his arms,
slit his throat and…
Oh my god!
Father..
Master...
If at least one of your teachings were
true, you can leave right away.
Otherwise, you're not going home.
Brother, Ramireddy is protesting
at the fort against us.
Then lay him down and slit his throat.
Father…
Master...
It’s your school time.
Come, I’ll take your class.
What is this ruckus, Ramireddy?
We need to sort it out like adults.
But you are already protesting.
Have I done anything since so many
years in spite of being the Minister?
But I’m still winning, right?
People are busy with their life. Why do you
take the trouble of protesting? Let's talk.
You’ve committed every possible
sin in the name of power.
I’ll have an enquiry on you.
I’ll have you locked up.
‘Your anger is your enemy.’
‘Your calm is your guardian angel.’
You told me this when you
pinched my thigh in 4th grade.
I don’t think it’s true.
I dealt with Ramireddy so calmly...
But it didn’t work.
He wants to issue an enquiry on me
and put me behind bars.
You and your bloody teachings!
Hey, Ramireddy!
You need to be really
gutsy to go against me.
Setting up a small tent to
protest will not cut it.
Do you want to know the consequences
of standing against me?
It will be war!
This is how a brawl should be.
Look at the tent...
Looks like a wedding trellis.
And you’re glowing like a groom.
Protest now. Let me see who will stop you.
Protest till you die.
But when it’s around 6 pm,
the sun will go down slowly.
And by the time it’s 8 pm,
everyone will head back home.
Soon it will be 9 pm and
we’re in power now.
Don't you think we can switch off
the electricity for 30 minutes?
Amongst the 100 people around you,
10 of them might be carrying swords.
Or axes and shovels for that matter.
They might be having a plan
to kill you for me.
And by 10:30, you’ll be dead.
What say, Ramireddy?
They will kill you for going against me.
They will choke you first
and then slit your throat.
The person who stabs you
will not feel a thing.
They do it for the money.
They’ll get drunk, go
home and doze off.
But you have a wife and kid waiting
for you at home, right?
You have parents too.
Fighting me was a pretty bad idea.
Sir, you only give me the lemon juice.
I’ll drink it and break the protest.
I’ll make mistakes, Reddy.
And everyone should accept them.
Sorry, sir.
‘Your anger is not your enemy.’
This is the lesson you
should be teaching.
‘A vulture might prey on several birds.’
‘But a single cyclone will sweep it away.’
I will hunt the cyclone too.
Ask that cyclone to show up urgently.
When I play cards, the groom’s
side is bound to lose.
No way! The groom's side
won't have any luck.
You’re right, brother-in-law.
Anyway, I got a joker.
Let me win this game, brother-in-law.
We’re the bride’s side.
I haven’t seen owners mingle
with the maids in so long.
Oh no! They’re not the maids.
He’s the elder son-in-law
and he’s the second.
Future son-in-law and brother-in-law.
It’s the bride’s side after all.
My son had a few flaws
in his horoscope.
So we got some rituals done in Kasi.
- Wedding is in Kurnool.
- So cute!
Dear, hot water for you.
Is she your elder daughter?
Why would she call me ‘dear’
if she were my daughter?
She’s my wife.
She’s your wife?
Mother of three children?
I got married at the age of 14.
I was literally forced into it.
Yeah, right. Also tell them I begged you
to cooperate on our nuptial night.
Dear, you can’t reveal these
details in public.
I did it?
Take it.
Hold it. Hold it.
Put the drape down and hold it.
What did I ask you for?
- Lukewarm water.
- What did you get me?
Hot water.
Hold the glass till the water
is lukewarm.
Come on, brother-in-law!
You’re being sadistic.
Here.
This is being sadistic?
This is perfection, brother-in-law.
Being the groom’s side, you’re
enduring so much embarrassment.
Do you really need this wedding?
When it’s a groom like this, we need
to put up with a lot of humiliation.
Do you want puff?
Who’s getting hitched to this fool?
We need to stop this wedding before
the train reaches Kurnool.
We need to make sure our sister
doesn’t go through our fate.
Our third daughter... Samskruthi.
She is so cute!
Are you going to ruin her life?
Find a handsome guy and
run away with him.
I love you.
- Are you joking?
- No.
I’ll get married to you and you only.
Do you get it?
But I’m already married.
I don’t mind being your second wife.
But I have kids too.
I don’t want kids.
I’ll treat you like a little kid.
Accept her, son-in-law.
Accept her, brother-in-law.
Accept her, son.
Once you two are married,
she’ll be your booze partner.
Wow! These emotions...
Never before! Ever after!
Let’s move!
No luck for you!
Hello, uncle.
Your daughter and I are in love.
We are in love.
Samskruthi is mine.
You better cancel this wedding
and support our love.
For the first time in my life,
I dropped playing cards.
- Sit down.
- Okay.
I mean down.
Get up.
Without taking any support.
Knee pains…
Body pains.
I can’t.
You can’t even get up
without taking support.
And you want me to
support your love, huh?
Uncle!
Fitness has nothing to do with love.
TC, is my berth confirmed?
His death is confirmed.
Oh my god!
Tell me. Why did you do this?
Who put you up to this?
Your wife and daughter planned this.
Let me go.
- Will you do it again?
- Dad! Dad! No, dad!
- Will you ever repeat this?
- No, dad. Sorry. Sorry
No, dad. We’ll do whatever you say.
- Promise!
- We won't do it! Leave her!
He is your husband and this is fixed. Go!
Why are you torturing her?
Half-sister...
This is torture.
This is all built up anger.
- Do you want to eat puff?
- Shut up!
Do something and stop this wedding.
I have a superb plan… Run away!
How will you explain the
plan to me if I run away?
Do you get it?
Running away is the plan.
Oh!
Your life is going to
change at the next station.
Oh god!
Show me a cute, sweet and handsome guy.
Do you get it?
Yay!!!
Cute! Sweet!
Why are you running like that?
Are you out of your mind?
Say something!
-Hey! Pull me up!
Move aside.
I asked you to pull me up.
Not push me away.
Why did you come back?
I'm talking to you.
Answer me… I’m talking to you.
Singing ‘Gaali Chirugali’.
These are our berths.
It would be great if this
guy became our son-in-law.
Our future generation
would be so ravishing.
I love you. Do you get it?
Hey!
Come here.
How can you be so shameless?
Why are you throwing kisses
and waving hands?
You need to respect him for his age.
Yuck! That kiss wasn’t for him.
It was for you.
Even you know that, don’t you?
Son, give me your hand.
Here are the betel leaves.
Thanks, auntie. I’ll have them after lunch.
Oh no! This is not for eating.
It’s part of a ritual confirming
our alliance.
This is my younger daughter. Say hi.
Hi...
Thank god! Now that they’ve held hands,
they’re half married.
Son, I want you both to look
out of the window once.
Over there.
Now they’ve finished the ritual
of seeing the ‘Arundhati’ star.
I’m putting her in your hands now.
Take good care of her.
She’s all yours now.
Let’s go.
Hey! Hey! Come here.
What's wrong?
You can’t just give me some betel
leaves and say we’re married.
You can't just show me the
'Arundhati' star from the train.
Mr. Prasad, I thought people only
abduct kids on trains.
But people manipulate others
into marriage as well.
Mr. Prasad, let's click their mug shots.
We’ll put them up in the coming stations.
Please don’t do that, son.
Once you have a baby...
We’ll spend the rest of
our lives serving God.
She must be telling us
rhymes at this age.
I guess it’s the influence of soap operas.
Please sit down.
You wouldn’t talk like
this if you knew our pain.
My husband is a evil man.
He keeps torturing me for
having three baby girls.
Let me tell him the rest.
He rejected the men we loved and
got us married to two dumbos.
Let me tell him the rest.
He not only ruined my sisters’ life.
But he’s trying to get me married
to another loser now.
Do you get it?
Let me tell him the rest.
I told her to run away
to stop this wedding.
Let me tell you the rest.
As she was about to run away,
she saw me and fell I love.
And when she told you about it,
you got us married. Like instant noodles.
Wow! You’re really understanding.
You’re a lucky girl.
He gets along with everyone pretty well.
Don’t get too excited.
Mr. Prasad, listening to their story...
I agree it’s wrong to get her married
against her will. Let’s fight for it.
But we can’t be in love or get married.
We're off on some really important work.
First let’s stop this wedding then.
We can get our love story back
on track before we get down.
Fellow sister...
Don’t call any girl ‘sister’.
They can’t take it.
I said it in a flow, auntie.
- Oh no!
Also don’t call women our age ‘auntie’.
Say ‘Mrs.’
Okay.
Let’s go teach your husband a lesson.
Wow! Such aggression!
Never before! Ever after!
Brother-in-law, I got a joker again.
Let me win this as well.
Are you out of your mind?
You played with your daughters’ lives.
How can you play cards and relax now?
They are majors.
They have the right to
marry anyone they want.
You know I was forced into
marriage at the age of 14.
I was literally forced into it.
Was it child marriage?
- My life is a mess.
- Stop it, will you?
What’s wrong with your hand?
If you want to know this secret,
you must know their secrets.
- Come here. Sit down.
- Son...
Mr. Prasad, this is interesting.
Come on. Sit down.
No, no... Don't listen to him...
Those days my BP was normal. 120/80.
My elder daughter is Swechcha
and younger daughter is Swathanthra.
I joined both of them in
a degree college that morning.
Swechcha brought home a guy
that evening and said they’re in love.
- The same evening?
- I gave them that freedom.
A little too much.
We can have kids but can
we decide their fate, son?
Acting like an adult!
She brought a guy home. And then?
You said something earlier, remember?
About being a major and having the right?
I agreed, considering the same.
The very next day...
He said he’s starting a business
and wants my surety for one crore.
How did you give him surety
despite knowing him for only 24 hours?
I know, right? I had the same doubt.
Swarajyam, what did you say then?
We’re giving our daughter to him.
Surety is no big deal.
Which tone did you say it in?
We’re giving our daughter to him.
Surety is no big deal.
They say wife is your better half.
So I trusted her with the decision
and signed the papers.
Did he start a business?
He cheated us and fled with one crore.
So did you have to pay the one crore?
One crore and 50 lakhs,
including court fee and interest.
Also 5 acres land, own house and more.
Right. That must’ve hit you hard.
No… For that, they put stent in my heart.
With this, you must have forced
your second daughter to quit college.
Exactly!
I’m father of three girls.
Rogues would use me a free pass to fun.
I appointed a tutor for
my third daughter.
I appointed him in the morning.
And my second daughter
proposed to him that evening.
Proposed to the tutor?
Same evening again?
Girls don’t need much time.
I asked him, ‘You’re after all a tutor.’
‘How can you take good
care of my daughter?’
So you did a background check
on him this time.
Next day, he brought home 7 kilos of gold.
How can a tutor get so much gold?
Same doubt. Swarajyam...
Must be his mother’s jewels.
What was your tone of voice back then?
You’re always being suspicious.
They must be his mother’s jewels.
Wife is your better half, you see.
So you must've got them engaged.
Exactly!
I thought his relatives would show up.
But the police showed up.
- Why did the police show up?
He didn’t bring his mother’s jewels.
He brought them from a Goddess’s temple.
- Oh my god! He’s a thief?
- He was kind of an expert at it.
Lucky, he didn’t slit your throat.
Police locked me up for a week.
And it’s called some degree, you know.
- Third degree.
- Yeah, right.
This whole time you must be
thinking this is some mannerism.
But it's the wrath of the
beatings I got from the police.
I get it now.
After all the shocks your
daughters gave you...
You decided to get son-in-laws
who follow your orders.
Bye, sir.
-Okay!
You understood me pretty well.
They fell in love with someone.
But I haven’t.
- Why do I have to marry a random guy?
- How?
Poor girl! She speaks logic.
How will she live with someone
she has no feelings for?
Good question...
I have a universal answer for that.
Hey, do you like me?
- Hell no!
She has three kids.
My elder daughter…
Do you like your husband?
Hell no!
She has two kids.
- Second daughter... Do you?
- Hell no!
She has one kid.
You don’t have to like the guy
in the Indian wedding culture.
You just have to get married.
You just have to go with the flow.
Kind of like how this train is going.
Exactly!
Your clarity, vision and experience!
Take a bow!
- Thank you. Thank you.
We have to do something. I want him.
Mom, he’s not the type
who usually falls for me.
I don’t even have the
time to impress him.
Help me out, mom.
I’m your mom. I can’t be
telling you this but...
When everyone is sleeping,
get into his bunker.
I’m not married to him.
- Do you get it?
- Ah, listen to me.
Scream loudly when you go in.
We'll enter the scene, say he forced
himself on you and compel him to marry you.
- That’s a great plan.
- I know, right?
But that donkey’s with him all the time.
Give way and the donkey will be
out of sight.
You heard everything?
I did.
Don’t tell him.
I will.
Her life will be settled
if you help us out.
You don’t know him.
I can’t do it.
- You’re being stubborn.
But you’ll be the happiest
one if he gets married.
We know you have your differences.
True.
But he...
What thousands of Kalakeyas couldn’t
do in ‘Baahubali’...
Old man Kattappa did it
all by himself, son.
What’s that?
Stabbing Baahubali.
Should I?
Let me tell you a slogan for motivation.
‘Meow Meow says the cat.’
‘Here I am, getting married
to the milky brat.’
Come on. One...Two...Three...Four...
‘Meow Meow says the cat.’
‘Here I am, getting married
to the milky brat.’
Dhotis are very comfortable Mr. Prasad.
AC on the top.
Dhoti on the bottom.
I’m going to sleep tight tonight.
No matter what you say, Mr. Prasad...
You’re my strength. My courage.
I can do anything
when you’re beside me.
Why are you sweating
in an AC compartment?
Your hands are shivering too.
You’re not planning anything behind
my back, right?
You think I would do that to you?
Why is she giving me that look
at this time of the night?
She’s going to the washroom.
Why would she give me that
cunning look then?
Her mother is also headed that way.
What’s wrong? Can’t her mother
keep her company?
No. Something is wrong.
Look. They’re walking back again.
Bathroom isn’t like bedroom, right?
They can’t stay in there forever.
They have to go back.
No.
They’re planning something fishy.
Something to do with me.
They can’t come anywhere near you
when I’m here.
I’m your strength and courage, remember?
Go to sleep with the same confidence.
Come on. Go to sleep.
Scream loudly once you go in.
What's the rush?
I'll call you.
-Okay. Okay.
Wait here.
-Who is it?
Aren’t you asleep yet?
Who? Who is it?
I’m making sure no one disturbs you.
Strength, courage
and drive, remember?
Sleep now.
-I'll be fine.
You are with me… Relax.
Be careful with him.
Oh my goodness!
So cute! So sweet!
So handsome!
Scream!
-Please wait.
Sweetheart!
What are you up to?
You're supposed to yell.
Crazy girl!
[SCREAMING]
Oh no! Oh my god!
My daughter’s life is ruined.
Just like mine.
I was forced into marriage when I was 14.
Do you have to mention that now?
Yeah. Literally forced into it.
Who’s going to marry her now? Who?
Some guy forced himself onto her?
Call him here. We’ll get them married.
It was you who forced yourself onto her.
You should only marry her now.
Do you get it?
Oh my god! I can’t believe this family
is manipulating me again.
With extra drama.
What are you still waiting for?
Get him to marry her.
He can’t just rape her and then marry her.
I’ll give her a good life.
First arrest him.
I’ll get arrested.
You only marry her.
He might’ve forced himself
on to her but we like him.
We want him to marry her.
Sir, you’re the elder one here.
Even if I did do this...
I’d have to carry her all the
way to here, right?
She could’ve yelled for help, right?
Huh? Tell me.
Wow! What a logic!
Give him a big round of applause.
He tied my two hands and
shoved a cloth in my mouth.
Where’s the shoved
cloth and tied rope?
Wow! What a logic!
Give him a big round of applause.
Thank you. Thank you.
He tied me up with this stole and
shoved it in my mouth.
Do you get it?
Father-in-law...
Tell sister not to hit me again and again.
I’ll poke your eyes, if you
call me father-in-law again.
Why are you still talking to him?
First have them both married.
You’re going on and on about the marriage.
But we don’t even have a holy thread.
Here, I have it.
Oh my!
You see how far they've gone?
They made a lot of plans to cancel
the wedding you arranged.
Do you believe this, sir?
Her tears kind of make it easy for me.
But this one’s melodrama is making it
hard again.
I wish I could have the opinion of
someone who’s not a part of this.
- There is one guy.
- Who is it?
My strength...
Courage and drive...
He’s the man.
Tell them, Mr. Prasad.
The truth is going to blow their
minds out and shut their mouths.
The truth is going to shake
this train upside down.
Considering the situation...
Effect of the weather...
Influence of hormones...
And that attire...
Thunder rumbling...
Lightening striking.... Wind blowing...
In that moment of weakness...
He must have turned into a monster...
And forced himself onto her.
In fact, he did.
It was you.
I’m a monster?
Mr. Prasad, do you remember?
You got shot in the leg this one time
and you were crawling.
Mr. Prasad, look into my eyes.
I carried you on these shoulders when there
were bombs and bullets firing around us...
Ran 4 miles and saved your life, sir.
This monster saved you.
In Siachen, when you were
frozen in the snow...
Mr. Prasad, look into my eyes.
I pulled you out, rubbed your arms
and legs till they were warm...
Inserted a pipe in your
mouth and pumped air.
That’s when you started
breathing again.
It was this monster that
saved you back then.
We’ll go back to the border soon, sir.
We’ll go through a lot together.
And this monster won’t help you.
I can save you only if you tell the truth.
Otherwise, I don’t think so.
No. No.
You don’t make that decision.
She wasn’t forced into anything.
I was.
They planned the whole thing
and manipulated me saying...
‘Meow Meow says the cat’
'Here I go, getting married
to the milky brat’'
They conned me into it.
‘Meow Meow says the cat?’
'Here I go, getting married
to the milky brat?’
Wow!
Such drama! Never before! Ever after!
Get her married to that Puff, sir.
Holy thread is also ready.
I will do it. I will do it right now.
Will you get her married in the train?
We shall host the wedding
in Kurnool only.
Let's go, dear.
-Okay, mom.
Wish him good night.
-Drama queens, I must admit.
Good night!
-Go away!
- Let's go.
- Go.
Tie them up, sir.
Good idea. Good idea.
Move!
Is our girl safe, brother-in-law?
- Yes, please come.
- What's this nuisance at midnight?
- Do you want to eat Puff?
Buffoon!
These dhotis are not safe at all.
Especially at nights in these trains.
Dhotis are not safe for men anymore.
Bah!
I’m having nightmares about someone
strangling me and stabbing me with swords.
- Who is it?
- You, sir.
Why would I stab you, son?
But you just did.
Want an apple?
Pomegranate?
Anything less than blood
wouldn’t interest you.
You’ve been doing this
since 12:30 at midnight.
It’s 5 am now.
Why don’t you go to sleep?
So that you can stab me again?
Mom! I want him!
Do you get it?
Let’s go to his compartment and look.
Come on!
Oh my god!
He’ll die. He’ll die.
Are you out of your minds?
How could you strangle your father?
Where was your mind at?
We suggested you to tie her up.
You should’ve held on to the rope
with your hands.
Why would you tie it around your neck?
I was holding on to it with my hands only
last night.
He was snoring all night.
So we tied the rope to his neck.
Do you get it?
Generally, people are hanged
when they commit murders.
But you hanged him for snoring?!
I can’t believe I prayed so hard
for my daughter.
Just stopped your snoring.
You should’ve stopped my breath.
That would make you happy, right?
- She would be happy I’m sure.
- Oh no!
These ropes can’t hold them, sir.
Tie them in chains.
- Mr. Prasad...
- Hey... Give me those chains.
What if he ran away?
He’s an old man. No chance!
If he sprints...
...he’ll die from shortage of breath before
he makes it to the end of the compartment.
See?
Give me those chains. Come on.
Greetings...
Old man turned out to be Bolt.
They grew up eating healthy food.
- Of course he’d be fit.
- But this is extreme.
Hey! Where are you going?
AC compartment isn’t safe for us.
Let’s go to the General Compartment.
- We’ll sweat there.
- We’ll lose our dignity here.
Father!!
These iron chains and train compartments...
None of these can stop me.
A man will come to make my love triumph.
- Yakubu...
- Brother!
Did you check the entire train?
The AC compartment is
glittering with gold, boss.
What are we waiting for?
- Let’s rob it.
- Okay, boss.
Weapons out!
- Please avoid this.
- It’s a 7’o clock blade, boss.
I know it!
I have lost so much
because of that blade.
Let's go.
- Give me the money.
- Leave it!
- Give me some of it.
Why do you need gold?
You are an orphan.
Why do you need gold?
One day even I will have a family...
- I will loot everything.
- I don’t think so.
- Take it out. Quick!
- Come, brother.
My bangles, necklace, mom's
and sisters' gold...
It's pure gold. Loot it.
- What did you say?
- Brother, do you get it?
- Yakub.
- Brother...
[STAMMERING]
I found a sister.
You look exactly like my son who
went missing at a carnival.
Can I call you as my ‘Son’?
Kathi...!
I also found a mother.
What's with these chains?
Why are you being tortured?
Tell me, sister.
Sister, freshen up and come
to brother-in-law's home.
I’ll get you two married.
Wow! You’re such a good thief.
Never before! Ever after!
- Hey! Hey!
-Move!
Boss...
Hey, Boss...
What?
Come and tie the holy thread..
You creep!
Why would I tie a holy thread to you?
You shouldn’t tie the holy thread
to this loser. I mean my brother.
But to this girl.
To my little girl, boss.
Your little girl? Who’s that?
Oh no! She’s back again.
She bounces right back into
my life just like a ball.
What’s your relation with her?
We were dacoits until a few minutes ago.
Now we have become slaves to
this little girl’s love.
We’ll be your brother-in-laws
if you marry her.
You’re calling her your little girl?
She’s the evil girl who
cheated her father.
All you see is the cheating part.
But we see her dating you.
If you saw what she did last night...
You wouldn’t rhyme so much.
She manipulated everyone into
forcing me into marrying her.
All you see is her criminal side.
But I see her love for you.
Dang it! He just doesn’t stop?
- Yeah.
They motivated him so much.
She must have said some slogan too.
"Cock-a-doodle-do says the hen
She's getting married to this cute man"
- Boss...
- Wait. Don’t touch me.
There are 5 tunnels coming up.
You should tie the holy thread
when we pass by the first.
If you don’t, I’m going to smack you
when we pass the second.
Thank you. Thank you.
You’ll be tying the three
knots in the third tunnel.
We'll bless you in the fourth tunnel.
And we’ll be out of here
when we pass the fifth.
Let me give it to you, man.
This tunnel concept is amazing.
You designed it pretty well.
Let’s make the most of it.
- I have some advice for you.
- I never take men’s advice.
Let's wait for the tunnels.
By the end of the first tunnel,
Independent candidate Ajay has
1000 votes majority over Ganesh.
Just a 1000 votes majority?
I’ll make sure to sweep you
out clean in the next tunnel.
Sister... He wants to sweep me out clean.
Sister, say there will be no marriage.
He’s thrashing me in the dark.
We will now be entering the longest tunnel
in South Central Railway Line.
Which translates to the
biggest constituency.
I’ll get the maximum votes.
I'll start rigging.
You’ll be surprised with my majority.
This rigging is damn painful.
Balot boxes are getting smashed.
You swept him out clean
just like you said.
Sister...
Don't you feel sorry?
Boys look like they're going to die.
Tell them you don’t want
the wedding.
A sculptor’s rasp transforms rock
into a sculpture.
- You can fight this through.
- - Stop it!
You and your bloody speeches!
Will you die if you don't get married?
Won't you find someone else?
You called me your brother.
Tell them you don’t want this wedding.
Who said you’re my brother?
You’re a thief.
Sister!
What's going on, boss?
She just betrayed you, boss.
Ah, your cunningness,
manipulation and cruelty...
Take a bow!
Boss, save us from them.
Make this decision as our leader.
Why? Won't you make it
as members of the party?
What do you want us to do, my lord?
You've snatched many chains for money.
Can't you pull one more
chain to save your lives?
Oh!
Even the iron chain looks like gold.
Pull it, guys!
Let's catch a lorry to Kurnool, Mr. Prasad.
-Sure.
"Wow! He’s co cute!"
"Wow! He’s so cute!"
"He’s so tall like a tower"
"He’s so tall!"
"He must’ve jumped out of Aladdin’s lamp"
"He makes me go mad for him"
"His cheeks are like Shimla apples"
"I want to grab one and bite into it"
"He has a bullet hidden in his eyes"
"His glances shoot right at me"
"He’s so cute! He’s so sweet!"
"He’s so handsome!"
"He’s so cool! He’s so hot!"
"He’s just awesome!"
"Like a vulture preying on a chicken"
"Like a crane snatching a fish"
"Like a thief robbing the treasure"
"I have to keep him locked in my heart"
"When he’s by my side,
all the women are jealous of me"
"His words are like an explosion"
"His hotness just keeps me hooked"
"He’s so cute! He’s so sweet!"
"He's so handsome!"
"He’s so cool! He’s so hot!"
"He's just awesome!"
"Who is your husband?"
"The one whose cheeks are red"
"I give him a coffee with
a kiss in the morning"
"I serve him lunch with a hug in the noon"
"And at night, on the bed..."
"Hey, girl!"
"I’ll serve dinner with bread and jam"
"I don't want any sarees or jewels"
"I want to be his child’s mother"
"There’s no song ever
made on a guy’s looks"
"The word handsome falls
short to describe him"
"He’s so cute! He’s so sweet!"
"He's so handsome!"
"He’s so cool! He’s so hot!"
"He's just awesome."
"He’s so cute! He’s so sweet!"
"He's so handsome."
"He’s so cool! He’s so hot!"
"He's just awesome!"
We fell into the bushes and
escaped because it was a forest.
- Otherwise...
- Yes.
What happened here?
The house is locked.
They must’ve gone out on
some wedding chores.
This whole image doesn’t give me
wedding vibes, Mr. Prasad.
Hello.
Professor Ms. Bharathi should be
in this house, right?
I don’t know, sir.
Let’s visit the college she works in.
Professor Bharathi?
Ma'am has been suspended four days ago.
We don’t know what happened after that.
She is in very big trouble.
Give me three plates idli.
Gayatri, get up.
How long do we have to keep
running away, mom?
Let’s leave this place for good.
Are they going to kill us?
First have your food.
Let's go.
We searched the whole place…
We couldn’t find them, brother.
Someone tipped us the wrong information.
Brother...
Let’s go.
Mom...
People usually use photo frames of Gods
for worship.
Why do you want me to do
it with this boy, sir?
- Because he’s God to me.
- I can’t do it, sir.
Lay this priest down,
slit his throat and...
- Father, have your food.
- Forgive me sir.
- Oh no!
- Hey!
Stop!
You taught me kids are a reflection of God.
Where’s that God now?
He ran away.
None of your teachings ever came true.
Do you ever go home
or going to die here.
Did you find the Professor?
No, brother. We’ve been
looking for her everyday.
- We’ll find her soon.
- You looked for her everyday?
- Did you go home?
- Yes, brother.
- What about your wife and kids?
- They’re doing well.
Did you take flowers for your wife?
- Give me your phone.
- Brother…
Come on.
Sit down with me.
If one Sitaramaraju dies,
millions of them will rise up.
Each one of them will go raring
like a revolutionary leader...
And destroy the British Empire
from the foundations up.
Sitaramaraju is not just a man.
He is an emblem of power.
He is a chivalrous warrior.
Don’t shoot there. Shoot here.
Who is he?
Alluri Sitaramaraju.
What do you see in him?
- Bravery!
- Psst!
Aggression!
Chivalry!
There are people surrounding him.
With guns in their hands.
But he’s standing alone.
With no weapon in his hand.
Look at the way he’s standing...
With his chest out.
Chivalry doesn’t mean sleeping
with your wife.
You must stand by the people
who trust you. That’s chivalry.
Do you have that in you?
If you have guts, go kill her
and prove your masculinity.
- Open camera 2
- Okay, sir.
I’ve checked a week’s footage, sir.
She hasn’t been to our depot.
She didn’t go to the railway station
or the bus stand.
She must be in this city.
It doesn’t matter who came first,
Its all about who won at the end, Mr Judge.
That matters at the end.
- Truly you are a gutsy man.
- Yes.
Excuse me.
Professor Bharathi and
her family are missing.
Could you please enquire?
What did the Judge say next?
- He said, ‘Get out of my court!’
- Oh my!
Why don’t you pay attention?
This is serious.
He must be new to Kurnool.
- When have you ever done your job, bro?
- Like you have.
Go to that corner,
give your report and leave.
We’ll look for her when we’re free.
What did the Judge say next?
What did judge say? His mind was blocked.
-How can they be so irresponsible?
Sir, CI has never been the dutiful one.
A guy just filed a complaint about
the woman you mentioned.
- Who is he?
- There he is. He’s leaving.
Hey!
Two cups of tea, please.
Do you know Professor Bharathi?
Bharathi ma’am? She’s my tutor.
Even I haven’t seen her in a week.
Let’s go there.
You stay here... I’ll be right back.
Ma’am, vehicle AP 21 FR 3456 is
waiting at the end of that lane.
That driver will take you to
Hyderabad safely. -Okay. Okay.
Excuse me… There were three kids
standing here. Where did they go?
I haven’t seen them, ma’am.
Sir...
Sir...
Sir...
Gayatri...
Gayatri...
Hey, Bharathi!
I know you’re somewhere around here.
You better come out.
I’ll kill them otherwise.
Kids are crying.
Why don’t you show yourself,
at least for their sake?
Come out!
Basava!
Hey! Who the hell are you?
Seena...
I promised God I'd sever her head.
Go!
Don’t worry... You’ll be fine.
Your son and I are working
in the same regiment.
My name is also Ajay.
He has already applied for leave.
Right before coming home,
he was sent on an urgent mission.
He’ll be home for the wedding.
You doesn’t need to worry about anything.
Mr. Prasad and I are here
for you till then.
We’ll look after all the wedding
arrangements.
Everything will go according to plan.
You have nothing to worry about.
Hey! Who the hell are you?
Hey!
I'm in middle of a conversation.
I said I’m in the middle of conversation.
Thank god we spend most of our
time in Kashmir, Mr.Prasad.
Temperature is soaring here.
Give me a water bottle.
Here you go.
Come on, ma'am.
It's okay. Have some water.
I have to admit this place is great.
We need to start the wedding
shopping from here.
What’s the name of this center?
- Konda Reddy Fort.
- That’s a powerful name.
This place is also lucky for you.
Mom...
Hey! Are you still worried?
You’ll calm down now.
Hey!
Have some coconut water.
Don’t strain yourself.
We’ll take care of the decorations,
catering, invites, hospitality, etc.
If guys like them
intervene in between...
We will offer them the best hospitality and
make sure we don't fall short anywhere.
Where the hell did you come from?
You’re going to die here.
Leave them and go.
Who should leave whom? Huh?
You’ve tried to kill me
in every possible way.
You attacked me in hundreds yet,
I didn’t even break a sweat.
You need to leave me alone.
Only someone scared proposes
a compromise.
I don’t encourage any compromises!
Don’t worry.
I’m here purely to talk.
Actually, I need to kill you
for what you’ve done.
In fact, it’s quite easy for me
to kill you. But this is hard.
I live to protect your lives.
How can I kill you?
We sacrifice our lives for you
at the border.
But you’re out here attacking women.
Aren’t you supposed to be responsible?
I've caused a lot of mayhem before I even
knew who you are or who sent you here.
But I will find out soon.
I’ll find out who’s behind this and
why you want to kill her so badly.
And when I do, I won’t be sparing you.
Things are definitely
going to be worse then.
I’m giving you a small break.
After the break, this is going to be huge.
Make sure there's a large
crowd at tomorrow's meeting.
CM should know our capabilities…
- Okay, sir.
Make all arrangements.
Is there fog in the daytime in Kurnool
that you are shivering so much?
Bro, do you have a phone?
When one Sitarama Raju dies lakhs of such
Sitarama rajus will be born.
Each one of them will be a valiant
revolutionary and they will attack
the foundation of the British empire.
Sitaramaraju is not just a man.
He's a mega power.
Not there.
Shoot here. Come on!
Who is he, brother?
-Alluri Sitaramaraju.
I saw Alluri Sitarama Raju
near Kurnool Kondareddy Fort.
50 people surrounding him.
No sword
…or axe in hand.
He stood so majestically just like him.
You'd rather wish for death than
take his beatings, brother.
When he's on a hitting streak, you're
bound to back off. Like I did.
After seeing Bharathi, I
prayed to the Goddess..
That I will offer her head.
After seeing him I prayed
to Lord Venkanna today.
It would be more than
enough to stay alive.
I was humiliated at the Kurnool centre.
I will not go home, I will stay here.
I feel like placing my head under
a truck when I hear it honk.
I feel like jumping in front of
a train when I hear it rattle.
I will not go home. Look.
I will sit in this corner only.
You will feed me right?
Near the fort, Sitarama Raju
said he'll come to you.
Why are you singing while sitting
in the corner?
Lay him down and slit his throat...
-Father...!
After tomorrows meeting,
We shall see that man and his manliness.
I’ve always condemned the wrongdoings…
For the first time in my life
I had to support the wrongdoings.
Bharathi...
Why did he feel the urge
to attempt suicide?
Even I don’t understand.
Uncle.
In an auspicious occasion,
why are you giving with left hand?
It’s ok uncle he is anyway left handed…
Give me the reports.
How can you declare Ravi’s
death as suicide, sir?
Can’t you see? He slit
his hand and died.
How can a left-handed person cut a four
inches deep gash with his right hand, doctor?
Who is behind this?
Why are you asking me that?
Go register a complaint in police station.
Sir, It’s definitely not
suicide it is murder.
Investigate immediately…
Big shots must be involved in this case.
You and me belong to middle class
why should we take risk?
Okay, give my complaint back.
I will go.
Ladies listen to us so well
I am going to meet your senior officer.
These ladies are so stubborn they will
stretch the matter to its limits
Give me the complaint.
What would you like to have?
Coffee or tea?
Clarity!
Clarity on why you wanted to see me.
You're a Professor, right?
You come to the point directly.
You're a Politician, right?
You beat around the bush.
You registered a complaint in the police
station that it is not suicide but murder,
take back the complaint.
- Does that mean you are behind this?
- It’s me.
I’ve committed a big crime, leave it.
I always stand for the righteousness.
I don't justify any wrongdoing.
I am also like that...
I make sure everyone accepts
my wrongdoings.
I am giving you 24 hours…
Take back the complaint
and apologize to me…
Otherwise, the very next second I
will show you what I am capable of.
I did not withdraw the complaint.
And the minister started using
his influence upon me.
They alleged me of leaking exam papers
He got me suspended and
hurt my self-respect.
He has humiliated my girls in public...
He sent police to our home in the midnight
And framed us in a drug case.
He had also filed several other
cases on us…
And ruined our reputation.
He threatened the groom's family
and got the wedding cancelled.
He ruined my daughter's future.
For pointing out Minister's mistake...
He wrecked me and my
family in just 24 hours.
We didn't have to go through this, mom.
We were such a happy family.
We don’t need all this….
Do something. Please.
Sir, I have come to withdraw
my complaint give it to me.
Ladies are so timid
they are scared easily.
Thank you, sir.
I withdrew my complaint sir.
Master if I was late to class,
how would you punish me?
I would make you stand under the sun.
She is late, right?
Ask her to stand under the sun.
Sir, please sir…
-Sorry, ma'am.
I have withdrawn the complaint
Please spare me and my children,
we will not mess with you.
I am sorry.
If students make a mistake
in college, scold them...
You have that power …
But if the mistake is in society,
how are you concerned, huh?
That power is with me.
I heard that you have sent
both of your sons to the army.
One is already dead and there is
no guarantee about the other son.
Now…you and your house needs a man.
Honest people like you will be scared
only for the moment…
I won’t let it turn in to courage.
Your game is over.
Kill her.
I don’t have answers for two questions.
My daughter asked why we were running
without committing any mistake.
I don’t have an answer…
I’ve sent my two sons to the border
to protect these people, right?
But now…
When the Minister said it would me
nice if there is a man in your house…
I had no answer.
Feed the children and sleep well…
Within 24 hours you'll have
answers to all your questions.
- But what if something happens to you?
- If I was your son…
Will you send him to fight the war
or make him sit at home?
Complaint on the minister again.
These ladies…
Don't give up easily…
What should I do now?
Reopen the case and draft a new FIR.
- If I refuse?
- He will make you write it.
Oh,
As if I am a small school kid...
You're trying to scare
me to do my home work.
He will make me write FIR, huh?
Try scaring me.
I'm not scared.
Mr. Prasad, he is strong.
He's not getting scared at all.
Will you do anything for money?
Not at all!
Will you get scared if you see a tiger?
Tiger…or its mother
or its grandmother...
I will not get scared
These policemen are so stubborn,
they will not listen like this.
Long back madam registered a
complaint which we closed
We are reopening it now.
Good, how did you get those bruises?
I am personally investigating this case…
Good… How did you get those bruises?
Narayana…
When we are discussing such
an important issue..
Why are you interested in my bruises?
There was an earthquake
in my police station…
The furniture fell on me, so the bruises.
Good but when there is an earthquake
entire city is affected...
How come only your police station
is affected?
Narayana it is not Dengue that
entire city will be affected.
It's Mother Earth. Wherever she is
angry there we will have tremors.
Nah! These don't look like
bruises you get from falling.
Seem like bruises from
getting beaten up badly.
These press reporters…
What's our next destination, Mister?
- Your friend lawyer Mrudanga Rao
- Thank you!
You should have called and
convinced your friend on the way
With those feelings I send
a whatsapp message to him
- What did he say?
- See
Ask him to come.
Hey! Ask him to come.
-He is very confident.
You will anyhow destroy his confidence.
Oh my god!
Seems like a river is flowing here.
Due to certain circumstances,
We have filed wrong
cases against madam.
Good. Where did you get those bruises?
If madam doesn't forgive me,
I will die from repentence.
Good. What about the bruises?
Narayana...
He is saying he will die Narayana,
how can that be good?
Why are you always talking
about the bruises?
...there was an earthquake in my
office and everything fell on me.
He already used that excuse.
What should I use?
There is water on the ground.
So blame the tsunami.
Oh! There was a Tsunami
and everything fell on me.
There is no water body in Kurnool.
How come there was a Tsunami?
He means…
There was an earthquake in the station
and due to its impact,
The water tank moved
and caused a Tsunami.
Good, if the earthquake was there
how can Tsunami come here?
Narayana, your father's
hometown is Alampur.
yours Kurnool. You have diabetes.
And so does your father.
how can the diabetes that
is in Anantapur come to Kurnool?
- That’s genes …
- This is science, sir.
Thank you, Mister!
Sir...!!!
Whoa!
Looks like principal is completely prepared
to compromise.
He understood him pretty well.
Sir... Sir... I'm sorry madam.
This is madam's rejoining letter.
You can come back to college
from tomorrow.
Sitarama Raju...
Hey, stop... Who are you guys?
Don’t you get it? Get out from here!
-I'm here to meet the Minister.
Mr. Prasad, is anyone listening to you
since morning?
- Can we go now.
- Go, sir.
You are correct.
I have to talk to the minister. Call him.
Can't you see that he is in a meeting?
I’ve to talk to him. Call him
and ask him to come here.
Who are you?
We are from seema… We feel the rage.
I will break your bones!
I will skin you!
I will lay you down and slit your throat.
You are tall like a vase,
One punch and you will turn into a pot.
A Vase turned into a Pot.
At this age, there is no chance
of you feeling the rage.
You have eaten well and become fat…
If that melts you will be in control….
From now on, you should be
doing something or the other.
Or else, you will turn into a pot.
Nagendra brother is the reason so many
people are gathered in Kurnool today.
What timing, Mr. Prasad!
Here soldier has defeated the Minister.
Over there Minister has made an entry.
Positive sign, son.
He has come home for the first time.
Should I respectfully feed him?
Or since he has come with my enemy,
should I kill him and bury him?
First option is better.
Feed us tasty Ragi malt
and rustic chicken, We’ll happily eat it.
Second option is risky.
Don’t try that.
You can take his review.
Oh my God! Mr. Prasad, he has
given a block buster review.
he has given 3.5 rating…
Listen to me and follow him.
Just because he hit 4 persons?
Not just 4. He hit 40 men.
He can beat another 400 just in case.
He is from the army after all.
You think I am your college student?
I am a State Minister.
Watch your words.
Hey! You think you're
a college student?
You are a State Minister
and this is how you talk to ladies?
Do you realize where you
are who you're talking to?
100 of my persons are around…
If they beat you, can you
leave this threshold alive?
Is this threshold Pakistan border?
We jump over the border like it's a college
compound and kill people in bunches.
He heard about you but has
not seen you in action now.
Show him so that he gets clarity.
What did you say? He cannot
cross this compound alive?
He is surrounded by 100 men…
He is alone.
Touch him!
Would anyone dare to touch him?
Hey, why are you guys backing off?
Are you scared?
- Oh no!
- What are those sounds coming from inside?
Thunders, bro. Arjuna, Phalghuna,
Partha, Kiriti, Krishna, Super star...
Is anyone else coming?
No.
Mr. Prasad, now the Minister
will pay attention to us.
She told me everything.
Teasing girls…
Making a Professor stand on the road…
After hearing all these…
I was so raged I wanted to load a gun and
empty the entire magazine in your body.
But how can I kill you?
You are one of the lives I protect.
We sacrifice our lives for you at the border.
But you do all sorts of stupid things here.
Aren't you supposed to be responsible?
You're the life I'm
protecting with all my might.
I don’t like the way you are behaving…
I don’t like it!
I am giving you 48 hours…
Admit your mistakes… Apologize to her…
Go to jail and transform into
a responsible citizen…
If not, you will see what I'm
capable of in the next moment.
Boy, do you think he will change?
If he changes by listening to me,
Like these people change parties,
it will be very easy...
But if I need to change him,
it’s gonna be a tough ride for him.
Somewhat like a seven seater
taxi ride on a bumpy road.
dhad dhad dhad…
It will be terrible.
Son!
Coffee!
Mr. Prasad …we just told him and
he changed in a snap…
your timing… your discipline…
your commitment…
Take a bow!
Minister, take your father as
an inspiration and follow him.
Bye sir.
What? Here vases are turning into pots.
Now you and your house needs a man.
If you face a similar
problem after engagement...
She will not abandon you like you did.
She would’ve definitely stood for you.
if there is an issue with assets or
the girl, It’s a different problem…
But refusing wedding just because you are
scared of someone is so unfair to the girl.
I can also instill fear in you. You will
show up at the wedding venue in minutes.
But that isn’t the solution, right?
You should let the wedding happen for
the same reason you agreed to it.
Your son did not abandon us
like you abandoned us…
He came to the station to find out
what happened to us…
That’s why we came all
the way to your house.
Let's go.
You've grown from a small time farmer
to a big time cotton seed businessman.
You must have taken many bold decisions.
It doesn’t make sense if that
courage is confined to the walls.
"Our hearts is swinging in a cradle of joy"
"Our lips are adorned
with a beautiful smile"
"Are you the sun or the moon
or are you the combination two?"
"Are you the charioteer or a bridge
or are you the breath of our dream?"
"Entire world is filled with love
or are you a sage?"
"Are you the revolution bringing hope
to people around you?"
"Are you one amongst us?"
"Are you the sun or the moon?"
"Are you a union of the two?"
"Are you the torch
bearer or a saviour?"
"Are you our dream come true?"
"Our hearts is swinging in a cradle of joy"
Where do your parents live?
I’m an orphan.
Who's going to accept the offering?
My son Ajay will.
But you said your son Ajay isn't here.
I meant this Ajay.
[chanting]
"You heal the deepest
wounds of our hearts"
"You're like the moonlight
on a summer night"
"You've crossed bridges to build hope"
"You stood by us in the darkest of times"
"You're our saving grace"
"And we fall short of words to thank you"
"Are you the sun or the moon?"
"Are you a union of the two?"
"Are you the torch bearer or a saviour?"
"Are you our dream come true?"
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ajjay’s mission has been
extended unexpectedly.
At any cost, he will be here
for the wedding.
Being there rather than here
is the right thing to do.
"Our hearts is swinging
in a cradle of joy"
"Our lips are adorned
with a beautiful smile"
The soldier is so tiny. How can he
defeat the Minister who's so big?
Didn't the big vase become a small pot?
P.A...
Find out where this soldier is.
The 48 hours that
he gave us are over.
Grandpa, why is the
Minister here at this time?
Hey, Swami... Minister sir is coming.
Let's go.
- Son.
- Take it.
Are you buying vegetables?
The bitter gourd here is very good.
You said you'll show me what you're capable
of if I don’t admit to my mistakes, right?
Show me.
Show me
I'm the life you are protecting.
So it is your responsibility to change me.
If it's a stained shirt, you
can wash it off with soap.
But it's the dirt that has been
on my body for the last 40 years.
How will you clean that?
How will you change that?
I committed a big crime.
I confessed to her as well.
I only drew the line
and I only erased it.
How will you show me my place?
How will you change me?
You had beaten my
people in this center.
You came home and beat my henchmen.
These people who are behind me
have come here out of love for me.
My people are my strength.
How will you beat that?
You want to see that strength?
You want to see that strength?
Hey!
What will you do if a
stranger hits your Minister?
We’ll kill brutally by hunting him down.
We will behead him and wash
the sword in a river, brother.
If some random guy drags your leader
on to the streets, what will you do?
We will wash the soil of
our town with his blood.
Tell me where he is, brother. I'll hang
his severed head at the Konda Reddy Fort.
He’s here.
Come on!
This is my strength.
My people are my strength.
How will you beat that?
Your people…your strength.
What’s the time, Mr. Prasad?
7.30 sharp.
Oh no! Samantha is inaugurating a
store in the next street at 7.30.
- Is it the movie celebrity Samantha?
- Yes.
Samantha from 'Dookudu'?
[imitating Samantha] 'I'm sad.
I'm going to look upset.'
'I'm hurt!' that Samantha.
Yes.
Dhak dhak dhadak!!!
Some guy said he will hang me to the
Konda Reddy fort. Who was that?
He was the first one to run.
Minister sir...
Come.
What happened?
Sit down.
People are your strength, huh?
If we are smart, they're street smart.
They appear to be behind
us but they are not.
They will take sides according
to their convenience.
You showed them a faction movie.
They were in rage.
I showed them a glamorous film.
They cooled down.
Do you know what true strength is?
I enter the battlefield without
fearing death. That is my strength.
She goes to any extent to stop injustice.
That is her strength…
Look. He's working hard for
his family since morning.
That is his strength.
Do you have a strength of your own?
Your power, your money, your people.
Leaving all this behind,
what is your true strength?
[COUGHS]
I was such a cool guy Mr. Prasad.
But ever since I came to Kurnool...
I can’t control my emotions.
Its the effect of this region.
Is that true?
Yes, of course.
You are experiencing it right now.
What else did you say?
It's the dirt on the body
since the last 40 years, eh?
Ladies will have better clarity on
this topic. How can we wash it off?
Soak in hot water, wash, wring...
And beat it against a stone.
All the age old dirt will
be washed away, right?
Cultured wash .
You wanted to see what I am?
I will show you.
You gave me an offer to transform
you into a responsible citizen, right?
Now I will exploit your offer.
I will rewrite the rules you've broken.
I will change your fate.
I will expose your mistakes.
I will put you in jail and transform
you in to a responsible citizen.
Good rhyming, Mr. Prasad.
- See you soon.
- Me too.
Oh no! We are in full form.
Wish me all the best, Minister .
Let's go buy that supposedly
good bitter gourd.
lets buy a kilo cook and eat.
You said you'd expose his mistake.
It's a new place.
We need someone who can help us out.
I've called one of my friend's friend.
He's a Crime Branch Officer.
No need, sir. We can crack it in an hour.
I think we should stick
to what we do best.
Trust me on this.
His intelligence is par...
-Who is he anyway, sir?
Crime Branch Koti!
Crime Branch Koti!
Epitome of Intelligence!
I want to be your assistant, sir.
I sold my 10 acres land and
bribed you for 25 lakhs.
Don't call it bribe, Kishore. It's my fee.
You looted my money after all.
I will be a top officer like you, right?
Just follow me.
I will also retweet.
My nephew is coming. You've ruined
that alliance in the train, remember?
I will see how you will
break this alliance.
I'm done with my work.
I'll leave, madam.
Greetings.
I'm taking the left over rice.
-Wait.
Oh no! Let go, sir.
Sir, let go.
Does sir have weakness for women?
While we are here to
discuss your marriage...
You are getting touchy with the maid?!
Uncle, she is not the maid.
She is a thief.
- Wow!
- Cool buddy.
She has robbed half kilo gold
and is going away. -Forgive me, ma'am.
Ma'am, add salt to the lentils broth.
Hey... Durga!
How did you catch her?
She greeted me without
knowing who I am.
She has responded without me
asking anything. That's it.
What a talent!
Every penny I spent on you
has been worth it, sir.
We are lucky to get such
an intelligent son-in-law.
- Exactly!
- You better stop being so dramatic.
The information I got is that
she met someone in the train.
I can't marry her when she is
already in love with someone.
Wow!
- A man with such clarity...
- Never before! Ever after!
So, let's be clear and
erase him from her heart.
Then the right thing to do
would be me marrying her.
They are more dangerous than criminals…
You cannot handle them.
Listen to me.
Ladies fall for the man in form.
I have come to this town
for an investigation…
Send Samskriti with me.
She will notice my skill,
caliber and talent.
She will fall for me and
voluntarily say she will marry me.
Epitome of confidence!
You have the chance to go out.
He's also in Kurnool.
Go get him.
What if he's not in Kurnool?
-Go to Kashmir directly.
Observe me keenly, Kishore. Okay?
-Okay.
Samskruthi, every time you're
impressed during the investigation...
Hug me tightly and express it, okay?
Feel free! But the hug
is important, okay?
Along with intelligence, he
is romantic too. - You silly!
We can give another 25 lakhs.
How long do we have to wait?
There he is, crime branch Koti.
I bribed your brother-in-law 25
lakhs for training under him.
Hey, Kishore! Come here.
No. I didn't use the word 'bribe'.
I said I'm your assistant. -Idiot!
We'll be visiting multiple
locations for the investigation.
So you didn't change your
scheming mind even in Kurnool.
After that horrible night in the train…
Why will I conspire again?
Excuse me! Have you seen
my friend's friend Prasad?
That's me.
- Why are you facing that side?
- He is shy because there are ladies here.
Yes, I am shy.
Oh her?! She is my fiance.
Congratulations!
But she does not like me.
You are early.
I want to spend some time with her
and change her opinion about me.
You are here. Why will
she even care for him?
I am impressed!
What is she doing?
- Hey, girl! Stop!
- Samskruthi…! Come here.
- Just pull her back!
Samskruthi...
What is this, Samskruthi?
You only asked me to give a
hug everytime I'm impressed.
Your friend's friend is so cute!
So sweet! So handsome!
I’m impressed.
Hey, stop! This man is
my friend's friend.
Greetings, sir.
So this boy died and we have to solve
the mystery, is that it?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Kishore, clues are very
important in any investigation.
Do we have the dead boys' phone or laptop?
We have his phone.
That’s fantastic! It’s more than enough.
-More than enough for you!
- Password?
- That is what we called you for.
Can't you crack the password?
Can't you crack the password
even after taking 25 lakhs?
No, Kishore! This is an iphone.
If we try to crack the password, the
entire data will get corrupted.
We can't go ahead with this case.
We better close it.
We can crack it with
some common sense.
Forget about common sense!
I've spent 25 lakhs on intelligence.
You can't use common sense!
You can open it with common sense, huh?
Come on! Open it!
iphone password is not
so easy to crack.
But with a little common sense, it
is easy to remove its screen guard…
With keen observation, we can find the
fingerprints of the user on random numbers.
1 9 8 2…
Might be his birth date.
The phone is open!
I'm impressed!
-Not again!
Hey... girl... wait!!
Mr. Prasad, get me the
data from this phone.
- Connect the phone.
- Yes, sir.
The three of them have a
common WhatsApp group.
They have been conversing
for the last 10 days.
But those messages are deleted now.
They must be classmates, considering
they're part of one Whatsapp group.
She has a software
employee tag on her neck.
There's a Government designated board
in front of the guy to the right.
And that's a bank employee on the left.
How can they be colleagues, sir?
I'm impressed!
-Hey! Why do you keep jumping onto him?
So my 25 lakhs just went down the drain.
Kishore, once I am on the field
you will see my caliber.
We'll start the investigation
from the girl's house.
This girl is dead?!
Soldier has lost to the minister.
We pampered her a lot because
she is the only daughter.
She was very active in studies
and everything
If she had told us about
her love story sooner...
We would have ensured that
they got married
We don’t know what
transpired between them.
By the time we knew it, they were dead.
What is the password of this digital lock?
Only my daughter knows
the password, sir.
Kishore, get me a laptop.
Also get me a fingerprint scanner
so that we can run the digital code.
We can unlock it in an hour.
Super
I am impressed
Samskruthi...
Are you going to return my
25 lakhs in cash or check?
- Prasad…
- Yes, boy…
- Let’s go to the government
officer's place. - Sure.
He is also dead.
Where is this case leading to?
Once again the soldier has been defeated
to the minister.
He married me even though
he didn't like me.
Recently, he met a software
employee named Swetha.
We fought regularly because of her.
One day, Bank employee Ravi and my husband
were involved in a fight regarding Swetha.
Suddenly they both committed suicide.
And his death…
It's very shocking to me.
The soldier lost yet again.
Kishore, you have to listen to this.
-Shut up!
Both of them like this girl.
But she likes him.
The other guy didn't like it.
So he killed both of them
and committed suicide.
It's a triangular crime story!
Minister is on the call.
You said you'll rewrite the rules.
What have you done so far?
The story is headed nowhere
no matter how hard you try.
Come on, Minister! Don’t pressurize
me so much. I'm terrified.
Give us time. We will try.
Try what?
As far as I know, you cannot
go ahead with this case.
We cannot go ahead with this case
unless we send this guy out.
Her parents only told us it was a
case of love affair and suicide.
Hey, they are not her parents.
She is an orphan!
- Damn!
- I am impressed!
You wait.
How do you know that?
Hey… you did investigate something right?
- Yeah
What did you observe
in the girl's house?
There was a tea cup on the table
and a half eaten idly in a plate.
And the two flies around the plate?
- Not two. There were four flies.
He must've been a hotel server. Bloody!
There is a painting on the
wall in the girl's house.
The quotation on that painting
reflects an orphan's life.
There was an application form in
her room signed by her guardian.
I also found receipts of her
donations to orphanages every month.
The Minister has created
her fake parents.
- Damn!
- I am impressed!
Hey, girl! Hold on.
Please wait. Hold on.
- Please take her away.
- Hey, Samskruthi... Come with me.
Come and stand here.
Kishore, then the government officer’s
wife is also fake.
She is real.
What did you observe in that house?
A bucket of water and a
cloth to clean the tiles.
- What about the broom stick?
- Right! 'Gopuram' broom stick.
'Gopuram' broom stick, huh?
He must be working in the Municipality.
You've gotten him into this.
Did you see the family photos
in their house?
They have been to 8 countries
in the last 4 years.
Most happiest couple…
Why will he cheat on his wife?
The Minister threatened
her to lie about it.
Oh... How did I miss that?
When did you ever guess anything right?
Minister made sure that whoever investigates
this case would go according to his plan.
We know this is all a lie.
But how do we prove it?
We can prove it if we
use our common sense.
Right! Like your common sense is going to
bring her husband back and reveal the truth.
One of the victims isn't dead.
I am impressed!
I'll give you extra 10 lakhs on the
25, bro. Let me be your assistant.
Please, bro. Please!
-How can one of them be alive?
Play those photos once.
Mr. Prasad, this is original.
This is the fake body
replaced with the original.
He has five fingers but
the fake body has six fingers.
He has created a fake dead
body instead of killing him.
Damn it! I lost.
-Hey, Minister. You got hasty.
This Minister is dead in
the hands of the soldier.
It's true.
Minister, you haven't
erased your traces well.
One of the three people
you've killed is still alive.
You used a fake body in the third person’s
place and covered it up well enough.
But the fake body has six fingers.
How did you miss that logic, Minister ?
So you haven't been seamless.
When you hid a man instead of killing him,
it is obvious that he knows everything.
I will find him in an hour.
Don't take the trouble.
I will only tell you.
He is in Nallamalla forest.
Atmakur is 90 minutes
away from Kurnool.
It’ll take another hour if
you take the Ghat Road.
Go and get him if you're
really as gutsy as you claim.
Why did you give it away, sir?
Did anyone ever return from
the Nallamalla forest?
Alluri Sitarama Raju’s biggest strength
lies in the forest.
He can't enter the town at any cost.
-Minister!
What brings you here, Professor?
I came to see you smile
for one last time.
Do you think he will come back
from the forest?
There are no humans there.
Only cruel animals.
It is not a municipal park.
It's the Nallamalla forest.
Forest, huh?
The man who went there is not a tourist
He is a hunter.
A Hunter!
Boy, they look so young.
That man looks old enough
to be eligible for pension.
- Why did Minister give such a build up?
- I know, right?
We cannot beat the youth or
swear at the elderly. What to do?
You go in a cool manner and get him…
I’ll deal with these kids.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Ramana... we have to lift the load
before check post gets closed.
Mr. Prasad...
- Son.
- You said you will take care of the kids.
You said he is an old man.
They thrashed me badly.
You said you'd take care of it.
I am taking care of it.
You try harder in this round.
Ramana... we have to lift the load
before check post gets closed.
You said he's from the military.
Those kids have been thrashing him.
I'll kill him in 5 minutes
and call you back.
I’ll get a call in 3 minutes.
Ramana...
Lift the load…
Check post will be closed.
What are you doing in the
forest instead of studying?
What were you doing, huh?
Ramana...
Lift the load
Check post will be closed.
Looks like he is deeply hurt.
Ramana, we need to lift the load.
He died before he could lift the load.
We're on our way with the witness.
We will reach Kurnool in an hour.
Your game is over.
My name is Ramakrishna, sir.
I am working as Mandal Parishad
development officer in Kurnool.
As a government officer I don’t
just handle applications or papers …
But lives of some people.
We are receiving pension
only for 6 months in an year.
My handicapped son is not getting
his pension regularly.
The funds that were supposed to reach
the people from the Government...
I wondered how they went
missing for a few months.
I asked my friend Ravi who is working
in the bank to enquire about it.
There we found a new truth.
Sir, take a look at this.
Hundreds of fake accounts were created
in the name of people with no identity.
We visited their homes
to find no one there.
But the money is being
deposited into their accounts.
Check out this statement, sir.
We found out these fake accounts were
created in Minister Nagendra's company.
So we approached a software employee
who is working there.
The data that she has brought revealed
shocking truths about the minister.
Previously, money is distributed by hand
in public welfare schemes.
But ever since they made it online, people
have found several ways to commit fraud.
This fake accounts creation
is a part of that.
Thousands of fake accounts have
been created in the past four years.
They bribe the officers and bank managers
without the Government's knowledge.
He has looted funds from the public
welfare schemes worth 5000 crores.
These evidences are enough.
We're going to meet the
Chief minister tomorrow.
He found out that we were
meeting the Chief Minister.
So Minister attacked us with his goons.
Those two lost their
lives in that process.
They held me captive in the
Nallamala forest for the evidence.
What we found out was
nothing extraordinary, sir.
People got used to these kind of scams
done by our leaders throughout the country.
Minister didn't just loot 5000 crores.
He looted people's hopes and tears.
This hard disk has got all the
evidences regarding minister’s scams.
Your wife and children are
waiting for you at home.
Go and spend some
quality time with them.
- We’ll kick that Military guy out of Kurnool.
- Cabinet will deal with him.
Why didn't you tell us
when so much was going on?
After all a soldier dares to oppose us?
Let him! We will show him the
power of a political leader.
Hey, Nagendra…
Is he the soldier you told us about?
A soldier is supposed to visit for holidays
and go back to guarding the borders.
Why do you want to mess
with the politicians?
Hey, you listened to me and
showed up without any fuss.
Now put down the evidence file,
put your head down and walk away.
Give me that file.
Let's go, Prasad.
Is this the guy whom you feared to?
Whoa! The soldier is locking the door.
We're trembling.
This is not your border
to show authority.
We control the system,
police and law and order.
We can put false cases on
you and get you locked up.
What are you still looking at?
Suspend that soldier.
You fool! Don't you know the difference
between a policeman and military man?
Hey, Army! You'll end up in the
Himalayas if I kick you here.
You're messing with political leaders.
We'll call you the next time
there's a natural disaster.
He's making some doll
that kids play with.
Stop making that doll when
we're talking to you!
Say something!
All right.
Since you asked, I will
tell you a small story.
This is an incident I
witnessed when I was young.
There is a place called
Burripalem near Tenali.
An old man planted rice crop there.
It grew well.
In the night, a rat would come
and start eating away the crop.
Old man got angry.
'Hey, rat! Why are you
destroying my crop?'
'Let me set fire to your
side and kill you.'
The rat's ego got hurt.
That rat summoned another
100 rats at night.
'The old man will set our side on fire.'
'We’ll hide on the other
side and eat all the crop.'
The old man is smart enough to
set fire on the rat's side.
All those rats choked to death.
Why did you tell us this rat story now?
Both our stories have so
many similarities, sir.
This is the rat the old man
wanted to smoke up.
You people are those 100 rats
that showed up for support.
Old man set the fire because he is a
farmer. But I am from Military, right?
That is why I have planted a bomb.
Bomb?!
This is not a bullet that you can evade.
It's a bomb, sir.
You'll explode into pieces.
Hey! I'll pull the wire if anybody moves.
I've set the timer for 5 minutes.
I'll speak for 4 minutes.
I'll diffuse it in a minute and leave.
Speak quickly. Make it fast.
My rat stole 5000 crores.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I typed 'Indian Political
Scams' on Google.
Politicians in power has looted approximately
upto 20 lakh crores in the last 20 years,
What? Are you shocked that
you had looted so much?
You have forgotten about it.
So did the people.
Country has forgotten too.
But Google did not forget.
If you just type it, you can see it all.
If at least .001 percent
of that scammed money...
Was used to solve the basic ground
level problems of our country...
For example...
If a child falls into an open tube well in
China, they are rescuing him in an hour.
In India, we call for a proclaimer
that digs and digs for three days.
But there' still no guarantee
that the child will be saved.
Why don't we get updated?
Japan Government introduced a railway
line for 3 years to help a girl study.
For a girl alone!
Let's not even mention the
Government schools in our country.
We lack basic facilities
like toilets for girls.
Why don't we upgrade?
Drinking water, good
roads, good hospitals...
And also the little kids
dying from ailments...
So much can be done with
the looted money, right?
Government links every citizen's AADHAR card ,
PAN CARD to his bank account in our country.
It tracks his everyday finances...
His income and expenditure.
You are monitoring every penny of these
citizens by sitting in an AC room, right?
Nothing wrong in it.
Financial transparency!
Rob from the rich and
distribute to the poor.
That’s excellent!
Similarly, we pay billions of rupees
in the form of taxes to you.
You pretend like everyone is
benefitting through your schemes.
You project the budget like a spectacle.
Don't we have the right to know about those
transactions and the loopholes that follow?
Why don't we get to have a look at
Government's AADHAR and PAN card?
Open an account for every constituency.
Give us the PAN card details.
We'll also monitor every transaction of the Government
while relaxing at home with a cup of coffee.
But you won't do that.
You can monitor us every second.
But we aren’t supposed to.
Because you want to loot money.
No matter how many mistakes you make...
No matter how insensitive
your acts are...
We guard you and your family
at the border responsibly.
You are the people that I am protecting.
We're sacrificing our lives
for you at the border.
But you act so foolish.
Aren't you supposed to be responsible?
That's my rat.
I promised that I’ll make him responsible.
If any other rat tries to rescue him...
I'll set fire to its side.
What if he had held this meeting
in the presence of Media?
What would have happened to us?
Let's not back this rat anymore.
You were sent to be my son-in-law.
But you turned out to be a broker.
What should I do now?
-You can do a lot.
You can decorate the house.
You can serve food at the wedding.
You can escort the
bride to the trellis.
Or you can pay the
interest for my bribe.
Look down.
-Do we have an option?
Let's beg that Army man
and host the wedding.
Where are they?
Dad, the wedding has to be fantastic.
Wow!!!
Such a wife and kids...
Never before! Ever after!

Chief Minister is planning to
suspend Nagendra from the party.
This party is like a mother. It will
punish anyone who commits a mistake.
We will sacrifice lives for the party.
You've been fired from the
party along with Nagendra.
Bloody hell! I'll find another
party if not this one.
I swear I'll change the
party in 30 minutes.
You are still in.
Nagendra has been fired.
Party is like a mother. It will
punish anyone who commits a mistake.
I will sacrifice my life
for the party and...
Sir, which side are we on now?
-That side!
Tell me, sir…
Ajay, we lost him.
I don't know how are you going to
convey this news to her.
But you'll have to handle this.
Just take care.
How will you convey this to her?
Even I'm not sure, Mr. Prasad.
The wedding was great.
After my husband's demise...
I raised 3 kids all by myself.
When I would pin flags on their
pockets on August 15th...
I would feel really proud.
Now when they salute the same flag,
I feel the same pride as before.
Even if my son comes home
wrapped in the same flag...
I will feel the same sense of pride.
Will my son come home or not?
Did I lose another son?
Should I mourn him or…
But many of them are fighting
at the border just like my son.
I could just envision
my son in all of you.
He's my youngest son.
I love him more.
I raised him well.
I will always carry that pain around.
But I can't demean his
sacrifice with my tears.
I just can't!
Everyone here wants to live a long life.
Even when the issue is petty,
they're desperate to stay alive.
They get anxious and visit
the doctor to stay alive.
They want to pray to God to stay alive.
They want to spend
crores to stay alive.
But for all these people
you're in no way related to...
How do you people sacrifice
your lives so easily?
In spite of that...
I gave two of my sons up for the country.
Why should I mourn?
Why should I mourn?
Be it any loss or pain, only women
have it in them to bear it.
Maybe that is why a country is
always compared to mother.
"Even in the face of
blazing showers of fire"
"A soldier paces ahead
in the name of his country"
"In spite of wrenching cyclones of snow"
"A soldier marches ahead,
refusing to step back"
"Bullets might rain hell down on him"
"A soldier fights death with all his might"
"Despite all the artillery charging at him"
"A soldier puts his life at stakes"
"He’s one and only
He's a soldier!!!"
"No one can match you!"
"We bow to your resilience"
"No one can match you!"
"You're an epitome of patriotism"
"No one can match you!"
Son...
If I hadn't come with you...
I would've missed some
great memories in my life.
Thanks a lot, son.
We have one last thing to do.
We should capture that rat in a cage.
Major Ajay is going to
submit witness in the court.
The judgement on Ex- Minister
Nagendra is going to be out today.
This is going to leave a
dent on my son's vase.
Is it snowing in Kurnool,
that you are shivering so much?
You already knew I was going to
end up in this position, right?
I only got to see Sitarama raju once.
You got lucky.
You saw him for four to five times.
'Aren't you supposed to be responsible?'
Sir, our men have started from
Kadapa, Produtur, and Anantpur.
They will kill him before
he reaches the court.
Why bother? He beat us at the fort.
He beat us at our house.
He beat us in the forest.
You want them beaten up too?
I've had enough.
No matter which district it is...
He's going to leave dents on many vases.
What shall we do now ,sir?
Let's go and surrender in court.
How come, sir?
In politics...
Sympathy is much powerful than
caste, religion, region or money.
We won't stay calm if
Nagendra brother is arrested.
We're ready to die for him.
Hail Nagendra!
He should appear at court.
I should be sentenced.
I should go to jail.
I should gain a lot of
sympathy when I'm released.
I should become Minister again.
Brother, he is not coming to the court.
He is off to the railway
station to leave to Kashmir.
What!?
If he's headed to Kashmir instead
of coming to the court...
He has some plan up his sleeve.
Start the car!
'Ruin others and you will be ruined.'
'Pen is mightier than the sword.'
'Truth always triumphs.'
'If you think you're
the most powerful...'
'There's always someone
more powerful than you.'
These are the lessons that I had
taught you in your childhood
They are the absolute truths.
Let's go to the railway station.
Let's go.
- Let's go... Hurry up.
- Let's go.
- One by one, one by one
- Ma’am…
- I will go first. I have some work.
- I also have some work.
- I have urgent work
- I also have urgent work.
- Sir!
- What the hell!
Do you even know who I am?
I am a Minister!
Of which city exactly?
This city!
Don't you follow news and politics?
After marrying her...
After having witnessed the
conspiracies around them...
State Politics don't
stand a chance.
- Minister, I got married at the age of 14.
- Stop it. Just stop it!
- Go.
- Let's go! Move!
There he is.
Hey! Why are you leaving me behind?
-Why are you leaving me and going?
- I need clarity.
-Even I need clarity.
- Actually…
-Actually...
- Why are you harassing me?
-Why are you harassing me?
We're talking about my life here. -We're
talking about my daughter's life here.
How are you related to him?
- He is going to be my daughter's husband.
He has already become my husband.
Son-in-laws visit every
Sankranthi festival in Kurnool.
This Sankranthi, it's your
husband and my hell breaker.
I let you talk before, right?
Now it's my turn.
You let me talk before, right?
Let me talk now as well.
I have important things to discuss.
- I also have important things to discuss!
No… I’ll talk first.
Stop it!
If he's irritated, he'll leave
a dent on yet another vase.
Thanks, sir!
Do something for me.
Pull each other's hair and fight.
Whoever wins can come talk to me.
Come on! Let's go!
What shall we do now?
Let's take a vote.
Whoever gets the majority can talk to him.
- Do you get it?
- Of course!
There's 10 of you and 4 of us.
You're going to win unanimously.
How long are you going to talk?
- 5 minutes.
- I just need 2 minutes.
- We will only take one minute.
- This is what I call house politics.
Okay, go.
Son...
She won’t accept any
alliance that I suggest.
She wants to travel
with you for lifetime.
I couldn't handle one day
train journey with your family.
Life long journey with her?
I can't do it!
Mother! Do something and
convince him to say yes.
What comes after alphabets o,p,q,r?
S!
- He said yes! He said yes!
Don’t use these foolish tricks on me.
Since you are requesting so much...
Mr. Prasad, find a pretty army girl for me.
- Hey!
Don't you get it?
You're being arrogant because
you're good looking, huh?
Don't assume I'll leave you alone.
If you marry anyone other
than me, I will kill her.
If they force me to marry anyone
other than you, I will kill him too.
I am madly in love with you.
Do you get it?
- Listen to me.
- Hush!
You're being such a show off.
That's not even the problem.
Because you look good.
But a guy like you...
Never before! Ever after!
She appears to be a nice girl.
Accept her.
Okay. I have to get
married sometime, right?
Mr. Prasad, ask them to fix an
auspicious time and let us know.
Done.
Wow! I'm impressed!
-Wait. Wait.
We're in public.
And we're not married yet.
What are you looking at?
Stop her, sir.
Come. Let's go.
Now that your family has
got a happy ending...
Leave.
You were so patient earlier.
Show the same patience with me.
Why are you leaving me and going?
You and I can't work it out.
Go to hell and I don't care.
I am going to Kashmir.
Mom, we'll have the wedding in Kurnool.
And the honeymoon in Kashmir.
Do you get it?
If you are leaving me and going, you must
have planned something for sure. Tell me.
There's no plan. Leave me alone.
I'm going to Kashmir.
- Do I look like a fool? What is the plan?
-Why are you shouting?
- I said there is no plan!
- Madam... Madam...
I made a mistake. I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Tell me what his plan is.
-I don’t know what plans he has.
But, I know your future.
-What do you mean?
You must do right by everyone
you have caused loss to.
- How?
- He asked me not to tell you.
Everyone here is playing it smart.
Everyone knows.
He has evidence against me and yet, he's
leaving me behind and going to Kashmir.
There is some plan!
I don’t believe him.
You're not going to slip, are you?
If you don’t tell me what the plan
is, I'll take this knife and...
Hold the bag for me.
What are you going to
do with the knife? Huh?
Will you at least hear me out?
I will kill myself with this knife.
I will not let that happen.
You're one of those lives I protect.
You're good at this sweet talk.
Let's go, Mr. Prasad.
You are going to Kashmir, huh?
This train will not move until
you tell me what the plan is.
Hey! I will not let this train move!
I'll not let you go without
telling me what the plan is.
What is this?
Your ticket to Kashmir.
You are coming to Kashmir with us.
What will I do in Kashmir?
I thought for 2 days as to how to
make my rat feel the responsibility.
If I submit witness in court
where will you go after that?
You will go to jail.
As a VIP inmate.
You'll have a TV, fridge, good
food, bed, meetings, settlements...
In two months you will come out
on bail, start a campaign...
And you will become a leader again.
What's going to bring a change in you?
That is why I am taking you to the army.
You'll be trained in the army
for 3 months from tomorrow.
You are selected for the Indian army.
This is your plan?
A 50 year old in the military
for training? Seriously?
- You have to change, right?
- How will that happen?
You have to get up at 4 am,
carry ten kilos sand bag...
And run 100 laps in the ground.
How can I do that at this age?
It will be 2 am by the time I
have a drink and doze off.
How can I wake up at 4?
You'll have to make another 100 laps
as punishment if you fail to wake up.
Hey, I will wake up.
Why wouldn't I?
After all these activities are done,
at sharp 7’o clock…
You'll have a small breakfast
according to the menu.
So little breakfast
after running so much?
I can rest after eating, right?
If you rest, who will clean
the ground that you ran on?
Who will sweep the roads
that you walked on?
Who will wash the clothes you've worn?
Who will clean the toilets you used?
By the time all this is done,
it will be lunch time.
- Will they serve a good quantity at lunch?
- Of course.
According to the menu...
-Lunch is also so little.
Never mind. I will eat and sleep
You're not the Minister anymore
to sleep whenever you want.
You are going through army training.
Actual drill starts now.
Climbing, dragging tyres,
jumping down ropes, trekking...
Climbing down hill, crawling on your
elbows, walking on your knees...
They torture you for 5 hours
straight until you're out of breath.
Are you humans?
You call this training? I will die.
By the time that feeling
hits you, it is dinner time.
Yeah, right! Like it's a lavish dinner.
They'll serve so little as usual.
Never mind. I'll eat some and sleep.
Who's going to do your
duty if you fall asleep?
What have I been doing since morning?
That was just warm up.
Actual duty starts now.
You must hold the gun without
blinking an eye in freezing cold.
Anyone might attack from the sky.
Anyone might plant a bomb under you.
Anyone might shoot you from the
front and stab you from behind.
You have to guard the borders while
you catch a sense of death 24X7.
This is what army
training is all about.
You have to work till you
drop for 3 months straight.
Then you will forget the notion of 'I' and
dedicate yourself completely to the nation.
When you see the flag, you will
feel a vibration in your body.
You will remember your responsibility
every time you think of making a mistake.
You'll feel like grabbing someone's
collar when they make a mistake.
This is called patriotism.
Not just you.
If we train any leader or officer in any
service for 6 months in the Army...
Why would they make a mistake?
The life I am saving is
headed to Kashmir now.
Congratulations, Mr. Nagendra!
Your training is complete.
-Thank you, sir.
How do you feel now, sir?
When I put this uniform on, I feel...
- Respect!
-Respect!
When I see that flag, I feel a...
Vibration!
-Vibration!
When someone makes a mistake, I
want to grab his collar and...
I want to...
-I mean...
Patriotism
Thank you! Thank you!
To your hard work, efforts
and determination...
Take a bow!
Here are the cheques
addressed to all of you.
I want to compensate for the
loss I've caused to you.
You first. Come on.
Think of me as your son.
Here's your money.
You're all the lives I protect.
We are sacrificing our
lives for you back there.
But you are so indisciplined here.
Aren't you supposed to be responsible?
Hey, everybody! Stand in a line!
If you don't listen, vases
will turn in to pots.
Hold on. Hold on.
How come you've turned
so soft all of a sudden?
Let's give our audience some energy
and entertainment before they leave.
Wow!
Great audience like you...
Never before! Ever after!
Dad...
What should I do to become
like Alluri Sitaramaraju?
You should go to the border.
You should become a soldier.
