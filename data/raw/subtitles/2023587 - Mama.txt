There's one word to describe
what's happening and that word is "panic."
And of course this comes with
unthinkable irrational behavior.
The crash
of '29, 1987's Black Monday,
came with tragic
suicides and murders.
This collapse is no exception.
Just one hour ago,
as the markets were opening,
two partners at
Capt Villiers Holdings
were shot at the troubled
company's headquarters.
Senior partner Laura
Mailer died on site
and analyst Albert Bernad
is in critical condition.
Jeffrey Desange,
also senior partner,
was in the office at the time of the
shooting and has now gone missing.
Victoria... We...
We gotta go, sweetheart.
That's it.
Isn't Mommy
taking me to school?
Mommy's not feeling well.
Put on your glasses.
Come on. Let's go.
Daddy, where are we going?
I don't know.
Fuck!
You're driving too fast!
Daddy, you're driving too...
Shut up!
Sorry, excuse me.
Whoa! Hey, buddy, you wanna
get behind the tape?
I'm family.
Lucas Desange.
You called me, someone called
me, a detective or something.
You live here?
No, no, my brother lives here.
What's going on? Where's Jeff?
Are the girls okay?
Where are the girls?
Sir, just hang on, all right?
Just wait here.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
...Jeffrey Desange apparently
shot two business partners to death
before going onto
murder his estranged wife
and kidnap his two daughters
aged three and one.
It's okay.
It's okay, come on.
Daddy, are we there yet?
My glasses are broken.
What is it?
This is okay. Yeah.
Victoria, come here.
There's someone inside.
Now!
Come on, come on.
Daddy!
There's a woman outside.
She's not touching the floor.
Why are you crying?
'Cause I'm sad, honey.
Why are you sad?
You know, moms and dads,
they try real hard,
but sometimes
they mess things up.
You know Daddy
loves you, right?
Uh-huh.
I can't see.
What's that?
Look, honey, a deer.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy? Daddy?
Look, Lilly, a cherry.
Burnsie!
So where are you guys today?
Well, we're gonna have another
look around Sector 1-7-12-33.
That's the mountain road, right?
Uh-huh.
Gas station... Go up through the
Wilson Pass... It sounds good.
Oh, God, I hate to do this.
Do what?
Your last payment didn't clear.
Well... I'll check on that. Don't
worry about it. The bank's screwing up.
All right, I'll look into
it and get back to you.
Thanks. Bye.
Thank you, God. Sweet!
That Burnsie on the phone?
Yup.
What's his next move? Is he going to
search sector plural-Z-alpha?
Hey, guess who's not pregnant?
What is wrong with you?
The last payment didn't clear.
So there's a problem
with the bank or...
The money's gone.
I pick "B".
That is the correct answer.
Hey, look, babe.
It's your brother.
You wanna spend all your money trying
to find him, it's okay with me.
It's cheaper than therapy.
And so am I.
Whoa!
I need to go.
Mmm-hmm.
Burnsie!
What?
Hey, Burnsie!
Jesus Christ!
We gonna call him?
Just give me a minute.
Well, we should call!
We said we'd call.
Ronnie, shut up
just for one minute.
Here you go,
Bird, take a whiff of that.
Hello!
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir,
yes, sir, yes, sir.
It's cherry pits.
Hey, Burnsie!
Burnsie, can we call him now?
They found them.
You're shitting me.
They found the girls, alive.
Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss,
and you must be Annabel.
I must be.
Lucas.
How are they?
Well, just let me warn you,
this won't be easy.
We're very fortunate
that Victoria was
old enough to retain
much of her vocabulary.
But it's still too early to determine
if her social development...
What about the other one?
That's a different story.
Jesus.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Victoria.
Is that you, Lilly? Hey!
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Hey...
It's okay, it's okay.
I got something for you,
for your eyes.
When you were a little girl, you had
a pair of these. Do you remember?
I'm just gonna put... That's okay.
I'm just gonna put them here.
It's okay.
Yeah.
That's it.
Daddy?
No, no, honey. Honey, no. I'm...
I'm not your daddy, I'm...
I'm your daddy's brother.
Remember? Uncle Luke?
Dad?
Oh...
It's okay.
Dad?
It's okay.
Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss,
Your Honor.
The girls have been in
my care at the Institute
since they were
found 87 days ago.
And how would you
define their progress?
Solid, and astoundingly fast.
If I may?
Your Honor,
Victoria and Lilly Desange
were found in
deplorable conditions,
isolated, starved. They feared and
distrusted all physical contact.
Their emotional growth was clearly
compromised by their abandonment.
In order to survive
such extreme isolation,
the girls created
an imaginary guardian,
a parent figure to feed them,
sing to them, protect them.
They called her "Mama."
Victoria and Lilly have a real
chance at a normal life now.
With the right care, physical
and emotional development,
and much-needed love and
affection, they will get better.
Thank you, Dr. Dreyfuss.
Miss Podolski, would you
care to address the court?
Good morning, Your Honor.
Jeffrey Desange
murdered my niece
and abandoned his
daughters in the forest.
Now, his brother did
an extraordinary thing.
Lucas never gave
up on his nieces,
but he did it for the girls,
not for himself.
So if he still has their
best interest at heart,
he must know that neither his
salary nor his very small apartment
are suitable for
the raising of two children,
let alone two children
with very special needs.
How many kids have
you raised, Jean?
About as many as you, Lucas.
Of course she wants
the girls, Lucas.
Stand in her shoes
for a second.
She can't just sweep in and take them.
They're not hers to take.
I'm not sure
that's entirely fair.
I'll tell you what's not fair. It's not
fair that she gets to buy my nieces.
Would it really be
such a bad thing?
What?
Annabel plays in a band. You
draw pictures for a living.
The way you live, do you have
room for children in your life?
I mean, really?
What are you saying, Gerald?
When it comes to
the girls' welfare,
the family court judge is pretty much
obliged to act on my recommendation.
And right now, I'd be
lying if I didn't say
it was a slam dunk
for Miss Podolski.
But the truth is,
I don't want them living on
the other side of the country
any more than you do.
So, we can really, really help
each other out right now.
You want the girls, I need
continued access to them.
What do we gotta do?
This house, courtesy of the
Institute, is used for case studies.
Rent free. You move to the
house, you get the girls.
This is a joke, right?
Mr. Desange,
is your brother still alive?
Has your brother contacted you?
Oh, son of a bitch.
Look, Jean...
No. I just want to
see them, that's all.
You'll see them, I mean,
you've got visitation rights,
we respect that, but right
now, we need a little space.
Just work on this thing for a while.
Find our feet.
Okay?
Excuse me.
October 26th.
Although she
seems collaborative
and is quickly recovering
her language skills,
Victoria may be
repressing the memory
of her experience
in the wilderness.
Okay, Victoria,
are you nice and relaxed?
Are you feeling sleepy?
I want you to tell me the story again.
Can you tell me the story?
It was a long time ago.
A lady ran away from a
hospital for sad people.
She took her baby.
They jumped into the water.
How could you know
that story, Victoria?
Did Mama tell you that story?
She showed me.
How?
In a dream.
Go on, Victoria.
And you can't tell
anyone where you are?
Nope.
That's just bizarre, dude.
Yeah, well, it's for the
girls, to keep the press away.
It's so messed up, though.
All families are messed up.
Yeah, but this one's
messed up and instant.
Heck, I didn't even
have the chance
to screw 'em up,
they came that way.
Leave him.
Can't.
You didn't sign
up for this, babe.
I can't do that to him.
Mrs. Sensitivity.
You are in a rock band.
I was in a rock band, yeah.
Hey, girls.
Hey, come here.
Mama.
No, don't call me that,
I'm not your mom.
I'm Annabel,
you can call me that.
Or Annie or whatever you like.
We could... We could work
it out together, right?
Mama.
Handsome?
There are no police reports
between 2008 and 2012
that match your patient's story.
And Doctor,
there are no psychiatric hospitals
anywhere near Clifton Forge.
Where would the closest one be?
Falls Church,
200 miles from here.
Now this logbook
contains records from
St. Gertrude's Asylum,
up by Douthat Lake.
That's 5 miles north from here.
But you told me that there were
no mental hospitals
in the area.
There aren't. St. Gertrude's
shut down in 1878.
Page 31, patient Edith Brennan.
Annabel?
Yep?
Handsome's outside.
It's all right,
I put him there.
But, he's crying.
Awesome.
There's no way these
kids are ready for this.
Babe, I know it's tough.
It'll get better, I promise.
I don't know if I
can do this, Luke.
Hey, I love you, girl.
Oh, my God! Someone's here!
What? Victoria? Lilly?
No one's here.
Someone's here.
I saw them.
What, whoa, whoa, whoa,
honey, honey!
I saw them!
Give me the hammer.
Give me the hammer!
I'll check downstairs,
you look after the girls.
Lucas? Lucas?
Oh, my God! Lucas!
Hi, it's Vince with Slap Chop.
You can be the...
Chop, chop, chop. Chop, chop.
I'm really sorry, Annabel.
But they told me he
responded well to the tests
and it's very likely
this coma's temporary.
What happens now?
I'm afraid I don't follow.
The girls. Now that Lucas is not...
The girls.
Annabel, the girls need you. They
need security, predictability.
But I'm not prepared for this, I can't do this alone.
This isn't my job to do.
Just grow up. If you
don't, you'll lose custody
and Lucas will be
lucky if he sees
his nieces every
second Thanksgiving.
Well, all checked out. All the
doors and windows were locked,
no evidence of an intruder,
nothing stolen, so...
So I imagined it then, yeah?
All right, thank you, bud.
Ma'am.
Richmond's finest.
Okay, guys,
just you and me for a while.
I don't know how you're feeling about
that, but we don't got a choice.
How have they been
affected by all of this?
They are talking to the walls.
What do they say?
Mama.
What is this?
They made that.
They found a doll in the
cabin, Victoria. Who made the doll?
Mama.
The doll's called
"Mama," or Mama made the doll?
Mama made the doll.
And who is Mama?
Are you "Mama", Victoria?
- This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
- Please leave a message.
Dr. Dreyfuss, this is Louise
from Clifton Forge Public Records.
Hound something that
you will want to see.
You guys okay?
What's so funny?
Good night.
No!
Whatever.
Nice butt, Bruce.
Victoria! Come. Mama.
You guys know what time it is?
I guess you wouldn't. It's late,
it's really, really late.
Don't.
Don't what?
Don't go in the closet.
Why not?
What's in the closet?
Nothing.
Okay.
It's been a long day
so you guys should
get some sleep. Go to bed.
You want me to
leave the door open?
Night.
Just tell me about it.
I think someone's
coming to visit them.
Who?
I don't know.
And you believe that?
I heard her.
She was singing to them, it was
like a lullaby or something.
You heard her?
Definitely a her?
Yeah.
Sound like this?
Yeah, but it was... It was different.
Her voice was deeper.
Victoria is showing signs of a
dissociative personality disorder.
I think she could be taking on the role of Mama.
Literally becoming her.
It's treatable,
with time and patience.
Am I safe?
What, from a crazy eight year old?
Give me a break.
I found a second entry
under the name of that woman.
Edith Brennan?
Mad Edith Brennan.
Welcome to Aisle 17, Doctor.
Every archive has one,
the lost-and-found
of things people
don't want to find.
Twenty years ago, when they moved
the Clifton Forge cemetery,
some of the oldest,
smallest remains
were not claimed
by their relatives.
They were sent
here to be filed.
I'm not a religious person,
but I do believe
there's a place
for human remains,
and it's not on a shelf
in a government building.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I can't say that I do.
When a corpse is left out, the
elements wither it, desiccate it,
twisting it into
a distorted figure
that is barely recognizable
as a human being.
A ghost is an emotion
bent out of shape,
condemned to repeat itself,
time and time again,
until it rights
the wrong that was done.
What's this?
The wrong.
Jeff?
Save my girls.
Go to the cabin.
Code Blue!
He's seizing.
Hold him still.
Lorazepam, 4 milligrams.
Four milligrams of Lorazepam.
Is the line going?
It is.
Fever?
No fever, Doctor.
Mr. Desange,
can you hear me?
It's okay, Mr. Desange.
You kick me off the bed,
I check on the girls.
That's about as
much as I remember.
For all I know,
it was you who pushed me.
Uh-uh.
I would have finished the job.
Oh, you drew me a picture!
It's a raccoon.
Thank you. I drew something
for you guys, too.
There you go.
You like it?
Yes.
That's cute. So, how was it? Was
it a tunnel with a light at the end?
Oh, yeah, yeah. It was beautiful. I
was so not staying away from the light.
Ha, ha, ha.
So how's it been,
life as a single mom?
It's great!
Yeah?
It's terrible.
They hate me.
They don't hate you.
They hate me.
They don't hate you.
So easy for you to say.
You're like the cool uncle.
I am the cool uncle.
What? What is it, Annie?
Just get well soon
so you can come home
and clean up
their mess, please.
You sure that's it?
Yeah.
You okay?
What are you doing in here?
Here. I'll help.
What is it?
I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you mean?
I'm fine. Nothing bad's
gonna happen to me.
You can't do that!
Why?
'Cause she gets jealous.
Hey, wait!
What's wrong with you?
Oh!
Hey, Jean. Um...
How can I help?
It's my day.
Are you sure? I thought
that was Thursday.
It is Thursday.
Sorry about the mess.
Children make mess. That's how it works.
How are they?
Outdoorsy.
You want coffee?
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
What is this?
Yeah, I know,
they're wild sometimes.
It's not an excuse.
Hey, now. They're bruises.
Kids get bruised.
This bruised?
It's not like that.
Let me have them.
Sorry?
Just for a few days.
You can, I don't know,
play with your band,
have a drink with
your friends...
Jean, I think it's great
that the girls have a
relationship with their aunt,
I really, really do,
but right now,
you need to get out of my
house before I kick your ass.
I'll see you both
real soon, okay?
Hey!
Have you been
coming around here?
I beg your pardon?
You been coming to the house,
playing with the girls?
Of course not. Why?
Doesn't matter.
Richmond.
Social Services.
Uh...
Who should I speak to if I believe
my nieces are being abused?
Well, what kind of evidence
do I need exactly?
How the hell did you forget?
Are you kidding me?
You know she wants
to take the girls from us!
I'm exhausted, I'm sorry,
I forgot today was her day.
Jesus Christ, Annie, it's one
visit, it's not much to remember.
Annie, listen, they’re just
kids, all you got to do is...
What? Chill out?
Take it easy?
You know, I can't do this, this is not my job.
This is your job.
I am out of here in a day, just
hold it together until then.
All right, fine, yeah,
we'll see what happens then.
I'll take care them,
those girls are
the most important
thing in the world to me.
Awesome.
Annie, you...
Okay, Victoria,
are you nice and relaxed?
Are you feeling sleepy?
I'd like you to
tell me about Mama.
Did she live in
that house with you?
The house by that lake?
Where did she live?
In the walls.
Where is she now?
I don't know.
I think you know.
I think you know where she is.
Where is she, Victoria?
Is she here in this house?
Did she come with you?
Open your eyes, Victoria.
Look at this photograph.
Is this Mama?
Is this Mama, Victoria?
Go away!
Tell me about her!
No!
Yes!
What's going on?
Nothing, nothing's going on.
Gerald, what happened?
I have to go.
I'll call you.
November 3rd.
The seventh session
was more than revealing.
I think I have found a door,
a passage, that connects Helvetia
and the Desange's house.
There is no rational explanation
that supports this theory,
but it is only the ability
to embrace a different reality
that makes science expand beyond
the limits of what we know.
However, extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof.
I now feel closer than ever to
the real subject of my research.
I will come back from Clifton
Forge with an answer.
What's wrong?
What's under the bed?
Victoria?
Victoria! Come! Mama!
Victoria! Come! Mama!
Victoria stay.
Mama?
Where Mama?
I know your name.
I know what you want.
Lilly!
Lilly, Lilly, are you okay?
How did you get down here?
You're shitting me. Are you shitting me?
Come here, crazy!
Okay.
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop!
It's okay. Come on.
Come on, come on,
come on, now...
Okay. Come here.
What?
You like that?
Okay!
Okay, door is good,
window is bad.
So if we want to go outside,
what do we do?
Use the stairs?
Right. Lilly?
Use the stairs?
Yeah. That's excellent.
Okay, let's go get breakfast.
Oh! God!
Lilly, you scared
the crap out of me.
Annabel! Breakfast is ready!
I'll be right down!
Annabel! Lilly's hungry!
Annabel?
Yeah.
Victoria? You and Dr. Dreyfuss,
you guys talk some...
I mean, you guys
talked a lot, right?
Victoria, Dr. Dreyfuss and I,
we talked some, too.
We talked about Mama.
You and Dr. Dreyfuss, you... You
guys talked about Mama, too, right?
Who is Mama, Victoria?
- This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
- Please leave a message.
Hey, it's Annabel,
I need to talk to you,
so please call me whenever you
get this, okay? Thanks, bye.
Yes, I talked to
Lieutenant Spencer two hours ago.
I'm sure you are.
I just don't understand.
I am afraid that something bad
may have happened to the doctor.
You okay?
Stay there.
Come on, get your coats.
Richmond. I need the number for
Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Yeah.
I want you
to tell me the story again.
Can you tell me the story?
It was a longtime ago.
A lady ran away from a
hospital for sad people.
She took her baby,
They jumped into the water.
How could you know that story, Victoria?
Did Mama tell you that story?
She showed me.
How?
In a dream.
Go on.
She fell into the water,
but the baby didn't.
Why?
I don't know.
What could have
happened to the baby, Victoria?
I don't know.
Mama didn't show you?
She doesn't know
what happened to her baby.
She went walking in the
woods, looking for it.
She searched for
a very long time.
And then?
Then she found us.
Why are you crying, Victoria?
'Cause she's sad.
Is she sad, or are
you sad, Victoria?
Where is Mama?
Is she here, with us?
Can you show me Mama?
She won't come here.
Why not?
Because she knows
you're watching.
This is Annabel. Leave
your message at the beep. Fuck you! Beep!
Annabel?
Oh.
Hey, Victoria.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Good night, Annabel.
I love you.
No.
Lilly!
Lilly!
Don't look at her!
She's mad.
Run! Lilly!
Lilly!
Lilly, open the door!
Victoria!
What's going on?
Are you okay?
Annabel! It's Lilly!
Lilly? Are you okay?
Huh?
Mama! Stop it!
You promised!
Leave her alone!
Annabel! Annabel!
Aunt Jean?
Are you okay?
Lilly?
Victoria?
Hey, this
is Lucas, leave a message.
Lucas, she has the girls.
I am heading to Clifton Forge.
Luke?
Luke!
Baby!
I got your message.
What the hell
are you doing here?
Where are the girls?
She took them.
What?
I saw her, she's real.
What the hell is happening?
She's going to kill them.
We gotta get to the cabin.
She was here with them the whole time.
Dr. Dreyfuss knew it.
Oh, God!
Jean?
They're on the cliff!
Victoria! Lilly!
No.
No, no.
Mama!
No. Lilly! Lilly!
No!
Mama!
Edith!
Mama!
No!
Lilly?
Mama, no! Mama!
Mama!
Stay here.
Bye, Annabel.
Sleep, Annabel!
Victoria, Lilly.
- Sleep, Annabel.
- Sleep.
Sleep.
Goodbye, Mama,
I love you.
Victoria, come.
Victoria stay.
Come, Lilly, Mama, Victoria.
No, Lilly, Mama.
Lilly! Lilly!
Victoria, no!
Lilly! Lilly!
No! Please! No!
Lilly!
Oh, God, bring her back!
Baby!
Lilly!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
No.
No!
Luke?
Lilly?
