Pull.
Nice shot.
Do your friends always
stay with you with a gun?
Yes, for my protection.
Actually, when one acquires wealth...
...you automatically make enemies.
This money belongs to your father.
Shouldn't he be
getting the protection?
What about father?
He's alive today,
he can be dead tomorrow.
I alive right now,
and i will stay that way for long.
By the way, your father
was praising you a lot.
You heard all about me...
...and i don't want to hear about you.
What do you do?
Pull.
Oh, my!
What about work?
I've money in the bank.
I've to go to the bank every month.
That's a lot of work itself.
What will you do after you're married?
What's there to do?
I will go to kannada with you?
- Canada.
Kannada.
- It's canada.
The way you say it,
doesn't give a warm feeling.
If you say "kannada", it feels homely.
Like bhatinda. It's kannada.
Tell me about your qualities...
...which no girl can
refuse to marry you.
I don't know about all the girls.
But i have the three qualities...
...that a sikh girl
would want in a man.
Jatt. Jameen(land) and jeepsy.
You rejected sunny.
How much more adventure do you want?
All your friends are married now.
But, uncle, i am not married yet.
Softy, you are still unmarried...
...because you're not as
beautiful as my daughter.
Stop provoking her.
Papa. I still have to do
many adventurous things in life.
And you want to get me married...
...to a boy who is good for nothing.
Correct.
I am getting you married to
someone who's good for nothing.
What can be a bigger
adventure than that?
Just watch, father, i will run away.
Run away?
You will leave me alone.
Your mother left me
and went away to kannada.
Its canada, father.
- Yes, kannada.
Ca... forget it.
Carry on.
- I am done for.
How will i face the society?
Father, stop being so dramatic.
I will think about it.
Four days later is the engagement.
After that you can keep thinking.
- Hold on.
Father. Four days...
did he even ask me?
Before moving ahead...
...let us show you the new
face of terror in hariyana...
...who has been named chaudhary.
Openly abducting anyone he wants...
...proves that chaudhary is a
bigger power than the police.
It's 5 o'clock.
Stop.
Stop right there.
Come here.
Hello.
You wake me up everyday at 5 o'clock.
Can't you sleep at night?
Do you get nightmares?
Sir, people dream with
their eyes closed...
...but i dream with my eyes open.
And dreams that are seen
with open eyes come true.
I see.
You want to be ambani,
driving a rickshaw.
This three-wheeler
won't be sufficient.
I will buy a four-wheeler car.
You know shanty singh.
From maholi.
He sold his rickshaw and bought a car.
Innova.
He earns 2500 a day.
And fuel expenses separately.
His car travels to all the places.
Delhi, manali, ladakh.
It's good business.
I will buy a car as well.
By selling my rickshaw?
- No, no.
What are you saying?
I've earned rs.60,000 by
working hard for six years.
I will invest some money...
...and the bank will
provide me with the rest.
Here, i earn rs.500 in a day.
And give you 300 from it.
There, i will earn 2500.
And i will pay that
same amount to the bank...
...that i pay you.
I will visit the bank in a day
or two to get my loan approved.
And then. You just watch
i will buy my second,
third, fourth car.
And then.
I will leash all the
cars out like you...
...and lead a peaceful life.
My own travel agency.
Enough, mr. Ambani.
You still have a long way to go...
...before you become
a rich man like me.
Go, drive the rickshaw. Come on.
And look, don't dream.
Go on.
- Yes.
Carefully.
Congratulations. Congratulations.
Here, here.
Keep the car clean. Here.
You have one too.
Uncle.
- Rickshaw driver.
Come on.
What's...
- here, have sweetmeat.
Your dream didn't let me sleep.
Yes.
I thought a lot about it.
In the morning i
sold all the rickshaws.
And look.
That car will go to delhi,
and that one to manali.
And that one will go to ladakh.
But, my money was in the rickshaw.
I checked everything.
There was nothing.
I had kept it under the seat.
You fool, does anyone
keep money under the seat?
Whom did you give the rickshaw to?
What is his name?
Yes, neetu singh.
The garage owner.
He took all the
rickshaws this morning.
You did the wrong thing.
You rascal.
I am feeding you sweets
and you are blaming me.
It's my six year's earning.
That money is very important for me.
Hey you.
It's very important for me.
- Throw him out of here.
I earned that money with hard work.
Get out.
- Listen to me.
I've been working for six years.
- Get out.
60,000 is a lot of money.
Get out.
Rickshaw driver. Bothering the master.
Neetu singh's garage.
Who asked you to keep
the money in the rickshaw?
If you have kept it here...
...i would've only
taken 700-800 from it.
Now you have suffered
a loss of rs.60,000.
Bhatti has gobbled up your money.
Here, drink up.
Bhatti has gobbled up your money.
Bhatti.
Drink up, what are
you thinking? Drink it.
Drink it.
Drink it.
Think about bhatti and drink up.
That's more like it.
He has completely shattered his hopes.
Bhatti gobbled up my money.
Bhatti's gobbled up your money.
Come, dear.
My daughter. She's here.
Uncle.
Sit. Come.
Come.
Uncle.
Here.
- Here you go.
'Bhatti is getting his
daughter married with your money.'
'Now go and dance in
bhatti's daughter's marriage.'
Celebrating with my money.
Bhatti!
You?
How dare you come inside?
Bhatti!
- You are drunk.
Get out.
- No.
I am completely drunk.
- I said get out.
Look, just return me
my money, that's all.
What money?
The same thing again.
Get out of here.
Return my money or else.
Threatening me, are you?
What will you do? What will you do?
You are elder to me, what can i do?
Yes. Get out of here.
I...
will take this big chair and...
don't leave him.
Throw him out.
Leave me.
Throw him out.
Hit him. Hit him.
He's taken the pistol out.
You might shoot it.
He shot it. He shot it.
I want my money, or else
i will count till three.
Or else i will shoot.
Oh, so now you will count.
This isn't a water-gun.
We aren't playing 'holi'.
One.
Somebody please stop this man.
Don't worry.
Look at his hands trembling.
If he shoots at left the
bullet will hit right.
But we are in right.
- Quiet.
Two.
- Look at him shaking.
Shoot. Shoot.
You fool.
Someone get him a
cold drink or something.
Two.
- Hit me.
Come on. Here. Here.
I will shoot you.
Shoot.
Three.
He shot
uncle's been hit.
I am hit. I am hit.
Why did you say three?
Normally three comes after two.
And you were stuck on two.
So i thought you
don't know how to count.
I just wanted to help you.
What should i do now?
He's not hit.
You're safe, mr. Bhatti.
Let me show you what to do.
What are you doing?
Papa!
- My daughter.
Go get her,
he's abducting my daughter.
Don't worry.
Papa.
Papa, save me.
Save me.
Quickly, hurry up.
- You're crazy.
My daughter...
what are you doing?
Father...
- he's taking her away.
Brother.
Let's go.
Let's go.
This is not a rickshaw.
Start it with the key.
He's taking her away.
Father! Help!
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
I am driving.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Shoot.
- Drive faster.
You're drunk.
If the police catch
us you will be fined.
You asked me to drive the car.
I only came from my home.
Drive. Driver faster.
How cool. You've kidnapped me. Yes.
Kidnap?
- Yes.
I kidnapped you?
- Yes.
You made me kidnap you.
It's the same thing.
I've been kidnapped.
What nonsense.
Drive faster or we will lose them.
And they're showering bullets on us.
Don't worry. I have observed them.
None of them can hit the target.
Drive faster.
Like i said.
You are safe. Safe.
Come on, come on.
Oh, god!
- Oh, god!
Not bad.
Do you drive the rickshaw similarly?
No, this has one extra wheel...
...so i don't know which
direction the car's going.
Take the next left.
- What?
Take a left. Take a left.
Turn, turn.
Just a minute.
- Come on, come on.
Where are you taking her?
Once more. Once more.
- Once more?
Making me go around in circles?
What did i do?
- Straight. Straight.
Quickly.
Where did they go?
They must have gone straight.
- Hurry up, come on.
Don't worry, we will catch them.
What did i do? What did i do?
Will you drink again?
Will you drink again?
Her father swindled my money,
and now she'll get me arrested.
Oh no.
What did i do?
If you've finished
talking to yourself...
...then can i say something?
I was the one who was
drunk and you lost your mind.
What have you done?
You kidnapped me.
And everyone thinks i kidnapped you.
What kind of a kidnapping is this?
I have a plan.
Keep your idea to yourself.
I am heading to nepal or someplace.
They will kill me here.
Stop. Stop or else i will shoot you.
I can get you your money back.
The entire police of
patiyala must be after you now.
It's difficult to get a
job around punjab, hariyana.
It'll take you at least 1-1a1/2 years...
...to look for a job somewhere else.
By the way, how old are you?
26.
That means by the time
you get a job you'll be 28.
It took you four years to earn 60,000.
This time it can
take you even six years.
And you'll be... 34 years old.
Then it will take you at
least six years more...
...to fulfill your dreams.
And you'll be...
- 40.
40.
Then a nice girl...
at that age you'll
have to look for a woman.
By the time you get married,
have kids...
when your children
are four years old...
...they'll call you
grandpa instead of papa.
Now, do you like this long story or...
...do you want to
hear the shorter one?
Tell me the shorter one.
Demand one million from
my father to release me.
Half yours and half mine.
I don't want this easy-money.
Fine, you can keep your 60,000...
...and the rest will be mine.
Think quickly, grandpa.
Fine.
What will i have to do?
- Its simple.
Just do as i say.
First we'll have to look
for a place to stay. Come on.
Open the door.
What is your name?
- Viren.
I am mini.
Dance for me.
What?
You didn't
understand or you didn't hear?
As i said, you'll do as i say.
Come on, dance quickly.
Or else i will leave and they'll
come looking for you... - no, no.
I'll do it. I'll do it.
What is this?
I am dancing. I am dancing.
Do it properly. Come on.
I think this girl's crazy.
Open up.
Open up.
Let's go.
For the past two hours no one
has switched on the light...
...or moved the curtains.
It's bound to be empty.
That's what you said for
the last house as well.
But you ran faster than the dog.
I've been running since i met you.
It's become a habit now.
Come on.
Come on.
Is this the time to
read other's letters?
There are unread letters
for the past two months.
The house is empty, let's go.
Come on.
Viren
come.
I looked around, there's no one.
- No one, right.
What are you doing?
Nice punch.
Come on.
Viren. You are still outside.
Come inside, the house is empty.
I'll go see whether
there's something to eat or not.
Tomorrow's plan.
Tomorrow you will call my father...
...and demand him one million.
Okay.
- Deal. - fine.
Let's go get some sleep.
Where?
Upstairs. To sleep.
Just lie here quietly.
I will go take a look upstairs.
Hello.
Remember.
If someone comes here
don't run away alone.
I am famished.
Poor viren.
The hunger must be
keeping him awake as well.
Viren.
Viren.
Mother, let me sleep.
Get up.
What happened?
I couldn't sleep the entire
night because i was hungry...
...and you have been sleeping soundly.
I' poor, i am used to
sleeping on an empty stomach.
My black and white film hero...
...do you have any money or not?
Money?
Here you go?
Is that all?
- Yes.
Your father took the rest.
Look, don't you dare say
anything about my father...
...otherwise i will...
- money.
We can get money by selling this ring.
This ring?
- Yes.
This is a hen that lays golden egg.
We won't cut it.
Then what will we do?
Yes, madam.
- Full tank.
"Touch."
"Can i get you?"
"Can i touch you?"
"Can i touch you?"
"Can i touch you?"
"Touch me, touch me, touch me."
"Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me."
"Hold me, hold me, hold me."
"Touch me, touch me, touch me."
"Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me."
"Hold me, hold me, hold me."
We'll eat, drink and have a ball.
"Hold me, hold me, hold me."
I will talk to you later,
i'm busy at the moment.
Hi.
Myself so sweet
sardar shanty singh sunny.
Owner of this petrol pump.
What is your problem?
My name's katrina kaur.
While cleaning the car i lost my ring.
Oh! Lord of rings!
Was it an expensive one?
It wasn't expensive.
But it was close to my heart.
And since i lost this ring...
...my heart's been throbbing.
Bill.
And he's worried about the bill.
You fool. You should be ashamed.
Get out of here.
Look at the time.
I am late.
My strict father will be very angry.
Don't worry, katrina.
You go home.
I will find and keep your ring.
You come in the
evening and take your ring.
After that you, me will get
to know each other better.
And the bill?
Don't worry.
When the heart's united,
why worry about the bill.
Okay, thank you.
God, don't make someone so gorgeous.
Hey, mister. Stop, stop.
This ring belongs to
shanty singh sunny.
Give it back. Give it back.
- "Your ring?"
I found it lying here, now it's mine.
- Yours?
I suggest that you take
rs.500 and give me the ring.
500? It's worth at least 5000.
I won't give it for 500.
Ask for anything,
i will give you everything.
Don't underestimate
shanty singh sunny.
I would've even given you
10,000 for katrina's ring.
And i would've have accepted
even rs.1000 for this ring.
Bahadur, collect the
bill for number four.
Sir, bill.
Chotu.
Come here.
Here.
Thank you, sir.
- Have fun.
That was great.
Shall we go home?
No, let's go for a movie.
Really?
- Yes. - which one?
Call papa.
Hello.
Myself so sweet.
Sardar shanty singh sunny.
Can i talk to katrina kaur?
- Katrina.
Katrina.
There's no katrina kaur here.
You fool, disconnect the call.
Hello.
Father.
- Who is it?
It's viren.
- Viren, who?
The rickshaw driver.
Viren, you scoundrel.
You abducted my daughter.
How dare you call me?
Disconnect the call or
else i will beat you...
he seems angry.
So, did you expect him to
ask you about your well-being.
Call him again, and this
time be stern, understand.
And ask him for the money,
directly. Okay.
Look, i want rs.60,000 or else...
you are asking for rs.60,000.
Demand for one million.
Move aside. Give me the phone.
Father!
Father! Father, save me.
Father, please. Please, father.
He has a gun as well.
Father, he's very dangerous.
Father, he's
demanding for one million.
Father, pay him up. Please.
Father! Father!
Leave me, please. Father!
Mister, your packet.
Why isn't the police doing anything?
I suggest that get his picture
published in the newspapers.
Fine. Get that
rascal's picture published.
Wanted.
Just leave that to me.
You don't worry.
We will get his
picture from his house.
Brothers.
- Yes, brother.
Get the car.
- Okay.
I will get him.
- Go.
Wonder in what condition is mini in.
Get it.
You will write to father tomorrow.
Threaten him and ask
him to get the money.
Okay.
- Fine.
I will go take a bath,
you cook the food.
By, god. I am really hungry today.
Let's see what you have prepared.
What is this?
Water. Here.
You call this food.
I don't know how to cook.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
You would've scolded
me if i had told you.
You're scolding me even
when i didn't tell you.
I thought its better to get
scolded after doing something.
No one likes to be
scolded without doing anything.
Okay, okay, sorry, sorry.
It's my fault.
I should've asked you.
It's okay.
How much money do you have left?
When will he get the bread?
It's coming.
Tomorrow, that pump...
sir, bread?
Just one.
Eat.
By the way, you shouldn't
trouble your father like this.
Where are your mother and father?
In my native place.
It's been six years
since i last met them.
And you think they aren't worried.
It's different in my case.
You're troubling
your father for money.
My father was getting
me married to sunny...
...because i have a
green card of canada.
And their family is
filthy rich, to buy that card.
So father was getting the money.
Sunny, the green card.
And i would've got a husband...
...who was living on
his father's earning.
If father had it his way...
...then he would've got me
married to some rickshaw driver.
I am... i am sorry...
i didn't... no, really.
Water?
- No.
Should i order for something else?
If i could get some more bread?
But we don't have money.
We'll also have
sweets along with bread.
Look.
Come on, come on, come on.
I am not helping you
in your antics again.
You aren't adventurous at all.
What?
I have heard about chandra chur.
Who is adventure?
Adventurous.
I mean you don't have that.
That what's required,
you don't have it.
What is that
everyone says i don't have?
Courage.
You don't have courage.
You want sauce.
Give him some sauce...
no, i said courage.
She wants to say.
You don't have the
courage to do anything.
Would you like you
have good food as well?
I am a good for nothing.
You are speaking too much.
Do you want me to
speak in your language?
You rascal.
Simon, go back!
- Come on.
Simon, go back!
Ask him go back.
How does he know my name is simon?
How can we gatecrash in
someone's wedding uninvited?
What?
Mini, listen to me.

Dance for me.
I just danced so much.
Hurry up or someone might come.

Fine, fine.
Okay.
Michael jackson.

I will give the music, dance along.
Okay?
Come.

Yes. Fine.
Come on.
"The heart's..."

But i never went to her.
I hate such things.
Whatever's happening is wrong...

You are foreign return.
You know everything.
What to do. How to do.
You show me the way,
and i will follow.
As things happen, with god's grace...
...i will keep doing as you say.
Okay.
Listen.
I don't think we should be doing this.
Last night i had little too much...
- that's fine.
People do absurd
things after getting drunk.
Take a look at me.
I got stuck in this
after getting drunk.
No need to worry.
I respect you a lot.
I've written this for your father.
Ransom letter.
Respected... uncle.
Read ahead.
I hope that you are fine.
Is this how you will write the letter?
Why? It was nice.
Should i get it typed?
Blood letter.
Until now i only
toiled hard to earn money.
Today you made me bleed as well.
This is called hard-earned money.
It will take two days for
this letter to reach father.
What should we do now?
- Two days.
Why are you hitting me?
- What happened?
I am not your grandson.
- Eloping with her.
Listen to me.
He was eloping with the girl.
What were you doing? Why
was the lady hitting you?
I don't know.
- Shall i call the police?
Why will you call the police.
- Catch him. Catch him.
I will talk to the lady.
- Catch him.
Ask her first.
- Catch him.
Why are you surrounding me?
Viren.
- Police...
i am talking properly.
Viren.
- What happened?
Run.
Look at the back.
Why are we running?
- Run, or else you'll get thrashed.
Why is everyone running after us.
Why are we running?
And why are they following us?
First dance for me.
- What?
Dance for me.
- Someday you'll get me killed.
My photo's been published.
Wanted.
Your father's got me in trouble.
My photo's been
published in the newspaper.
They're coming. Run.
They're gone.
They made me run so much.
My legs are paining.
I ran a lot.
I am tired of running.
He's tired. Madam.
So try us.
We won't tire easily.
What did you say?
We're from delhi.
We have fallen for this girl.
Now leave her right here
and get lost. Run away.
Viren.
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
Look at them.
They will squash you...
look at his muscles.
He will beat you to a pulp. Come on.
One needs courage to
fight and not muscles.
Viren.
Viren. Chill. Control.
You are cheating, you rascal.
Take this.
- Good shot.
Run. Run.
Take this, you rascal.
Viren, my hero.
Awesome. Superb.
They... they ran away.
I am very hungry.
Are you hungry?
Money?
- Yes, money.
Money?
I am not that hungry.
Don't worry.
We still have this.
Once again?
"My eyes... are tired."
"How long will i
have to wait for you?"
"My eyes... are tired."
"You're my life."
"My beloved."
"You're dearer than life."
"My beloved."
"You're my life."
"My beloved."
"You're dearer than life."
"My beloved."
"I am waiting for you."
"I am thinking about you."
"Now i wish only for you."
"Know that."
"You...
- are love."
"You...
- are devotion."
"You...
- are the reason of my existence."
"You...
- are habit."
"You...
- are passion."
"You...
- are the reason of my existence."
"My eyes... are tired."
"How long will i
have to wait for you?"
"Somewhere here... i lost myself."
"All i dream about is you."
"The moments conspired
and brought us together."
"Gradually my heart
revealed without saying a word."
"You entered my heart."
"Like peace graced me."
"Why won't i be restless now?"
"Know that."
"You...
- are love."
"You...
- are devotion."
"You...
- are the reason of my existence."
"You...
- are habit."
"You...
- are passion."
"You...
- are the reason of my existence."
"My eyes... are tired."
"You are the reason of my existence."
"How long will i
have to wait for you?"
"My eyes... are tired."
"You are the reason of my existence."
Put it in a bag and
keep it near the red flag.
Otherwise your daughter...
uncle, don't you worry.
He can't be so bold.
This must be the blood
of some hen or something.
This is my hen's...
my daughter's blood.
My blood.
He has asked me to
bring one million...
...to the ground
behind the 'lakkad bazaar'
otherwise he will...
where will i get one million from?
- Don't worry, uncle.
We will go with you
along with the money.
Right, brothers?
Are you all ready?
- Yes, of course.
So quiet.
This is the first
time i saw you so quiet.
You aren't saying anything either.
I... i am not saying
anything because...
i am not saying anything because...
...i am not happy at all.
- Why?
Why aren't you happy?
Our deal will be finalized today.
We're getting the money as well.
On that note let me dance for you.
Here.
Today after you get your money...
...then where will you go?
I...
i will go back.
You can take all the money.
Why will you go back home?
If you go back you
will have to marry sunny.
You won't go back.
You're so concerned about me.
You won't go back, mini.
- Why?
Because...
- because now we are good friends...
...or... are we very good friends?
We...
- we are very good friends.
Shall i come along with you?
- What? Where?
Timbuktu. What
difference does it make?
Look, mini, you are
not going anywhere.
Drop this useless idea.
Take your money and...
i don't want to go back.
I will come along with you, please.
Look, i will finance your
idea of 'chotu travels'.
We both can be business partners.
Look, please don't send me back.
I will...
quiet.
Sit quietly.
Since when has sanjay dutt's photo...
...printed on currency notes?
What is happening?
Is it diwali today?
Wait a minute.
Aim properly.
We will nail him.
Shoot. Shoot.
Sunny.
- Shoot him.
It's your fianca©.
But why is he firing at us?
Why is he so angry?
What is it?
You could've taken it out yourself.
- Move.
I don't want to get shot
in the crossfire. - What?
You were ready to go
to timbuktu with me.
And now you're asking me to get away.
Shoot him.
Have you lost your mind?
My daughter might get hit.
- Nothing will happen.
We will not spare him.
Listen to us. Listen.
- Don't fire.
Wait a minute. I will take a look.
Listen. Listen.
Uncle, please. Don't worry.
Shoot.
What happened?
Someone's firing from
the other side as well.
Maybe someone might save us.
Who is he?
I don't know who he is.
Mini.
Where are you taking my daughter?
Stop.
Mini. Mini.
They're gone. Someone stop him. Mini.
Stop.
First my daughter was kidnapped.
Now the kidnapper's
been kidnapped as well.
Don't you know?
- Come on, hurry up.
Strange.
'Not just my daughter...
...but now her kidnapper's
been kidnapped as well.'
Hail lord mahadev.
Are you giving him a hug?
Well done, well done.
Hold on to his cloth.
Hold on.
Well done, well done.
What's happening?
Hey, uncle.
What are we doing here?
Is this the way, you
forcefully brought us here.
Chaudhary.
My name is chaudhary.
I am not your relative.
And the only relation
i have with anyone...
...is that i am chotu's father.
Chotu.
To hell with your six footer chotu...
where is my chotu?
Chotu. Chotu.
Chotu.
- Mother.
How are you, chotu?
Where did you go
leaving your mother alone?
You troubled us a lot. My child.
Aunt.
He's chotu.
Are you crazy?
He's my chotu. Isn't it?
Uncle.
Is he chotu?
Are you chotu?
I will tell you what he is.
Chaudhary's son drives
a rickshaw in the city.
Do you want a tight slap?
- Stop it now.
He has returned after so many years.
And you're already scolding him.
For six years your uncle has
been protecting you in the city.
I had been receiving all
the information about you.
When i saw your photo in
the newspaper "wanted".
I felt so proud.
I thought that it took time...
...but finally my blood
showed its true colors.
Then your uncle told me...
...that the girl abducted you,
you didn't abduct her.
I felt so ashamed.
It's okay.
Whatever happened was the past.
Now this girl wants one
million from her father...
...in return of her freedom.
We will ask for 1.5.
Look, dear. Don't be too relieved.
From today you're chaudhary's guest.
So cool.
You're the son of
such a dangerous man.
You didn't tell me.
Kidnapped.
You've been kidnapped.
Do you understand?
Be thankful that you are
freely roaming around.
Otherwise you would've been
locked up in one of these rooms.
My father's profession
is to kidnap people.
My father wanted me to
enter this profession, as well.
He would train me.
"Go and get the neighbor's hen."
"Go and get the neighbor's goat."
One day he sent me to get the bullock.
I ran for my life
and never looked back.
And you say that i trouble my parents.
You know of my friends...
...someone's father would sell milk...
...while someone would run a shop.
My father would abduct their father.
'Agva house'. That's what
the villagers call this place.
My uncle raised me.
Father was always
'farrari' (on the run).
Ferrari?
He would always be
on the run. My father.
Have you heard about guru wrestler?
Uncle is his son.
And my father's childhood friend.
Father was such a good friend...
...that he didn't
let him go back home.
Since them uncle's
been living with us.
Uncle never says anything.
Like they say.
Only a mother what
her child wants to say.
Father understands
what uncle wants to say.
Brother chotu.
- Dhani.
So you have finally returned?
No, i didn't. I have brought back.
You know, brother, i
looked everywhere for you.
Rajdhani, paschim express.
I searched all the trains.
But you... were nowhere to be found.
You are so gorgeous.
God save you from evil-eyes.
I am leaving.
She's my sister.
She's the station master's daughter.
Station master's daughter?
Actually, she was four year old...
...when she called my father "father".
My father was so overwhelmed...
...that he brought her home.
She robs passengers in moving trains.
Rajdhani is her specialty.
Really.
- Yes.
That's why she's been named dhani.
She stole... your earrings.
I want everything finalized.
I don't want any delay.
Brother naidu.
Chotu.
Where were you?
The entire family was worried.
I was worried myself.
I take part in the elections...
...and you disappear for five years.
Did you see hariyana's
sport's centre while coming here?
How was it?
They brought me tied up in a sack?
How could i see it?
Tied in a sack.
Uncle brought you back.
Chotu. Friend.
Hello.
I am fighting for woman equality.
Cast your valuable vote to me.
Okay?
- Okay.
Okay?
- Okay.
Shout slogans for chotu
long live chotu.
Long live chotu.
- Fine.
Long live chotu.
- Fine, fine.
Okay, chotu. I am leaving now.
I will call you later.
My elder brother.
- South indian.
Yes.
Years ago a minister from andhra...
...borrowed money from
father to contest the elections.
He wasn't returning the money
after winning the elections.
So father went to his house...
...and started taking all the things.
Just then there was a
child sitting on the chair...
...and he wasn't
getting off the chair.
And boy isn't ready
to get off even today.
My brother naidu.
I get it.
Your mother.
Your father must have
brought her from a television set.
She so overacting.
"Chotu. Chotu."
Minnie.
In this house, only me
and my mother are original.
I am sorry.
- By the way.
Father would keep
anyone he liked at home.
Will he like me?
Don't rack your brains too much.
I will elope with
you in two-three days.
What's the hurry?
We will stay back for a week or two.
- No, no.
Let's stay back for a month.
Let's start living here.
- Okay, thank you.
Mini. Mini, listen...
father asked me to
dress you up properly.
You are looking so sweet.
Dhani.
- Yes.
These earrings look
really nice on you.
They do, don't they?
I bought them from delhi.
You can come along as well,
i will buy them for you too.
Don't look at me like that.
I didn't steal them.
This is called trickery.
What's the difference?
One steals covertly.
And tricking someone is a bold job.
When someone's robbed he gets sad.
But when someone's
tricked he's amazed.
That's the difference
between the two. - I see.
Since when have you been doing this?
Look, as a child i was
very interested in magic.
I used to make coins
appear from thin air.
But now that i have grown up...
...i make them disappear
from the pocket of people.
Will you teach me as well?
- Yes, why not.
Look, while taking your hands
near the face, the earrings...
dhani. Not this.
I want to learn the
bewitchment in your eyes.
Go on now, don't get to sweet.
Now you look like a woman.
You look so
beautiful in these clothes.
Sit.
Slice the onions diagonally.
Don't you know how to cook food?
There was no one to teach me.
Why? Was your mother busy in
kitty parties the entire day?
I was very young when
my mother passed away.
Forgive me, dear.
Even i have grown brazen
living with chaudhary.
Enough, stop crying now.
I will teach you how to cook food.
Give me the onions.
Mother.
Ask that aunt to use
less clarified butter.
Don't worry, dear.
We will use less
clarified butter in your food.
Go. Go outside.
Take a walk around.
Mother. Can i take an apple?
The doctor we had
abducted from faridabad.
Have they sent the
ransom amount for him?
Yes, they did.
I released him this morning.
Mr. Chaudhary.
What did you do?
He's not my husband?
He is not that old?
I paid the entire ransom.
And this is what you send me.
What is she saying, jatta?
Take a good look,
lady. It must be him.
Aren't you her husband?
I... i...
why are you stammering?
What's going on, man?
What did you feed my father?
How did he grow so young?
Where's my original father.
He's my husband.
- Papa.
Son.
You are here.
- Thank god i found you.
Have you lost your mind?
You never do anything right.
Uncle.
Listen.
And that girl.
Wonder what she's made of.
She keeps jumping
around the entire day.
Hello.
Mr. Chaudhary, i have
sent the ransom amount.
Yes, we received the money.
Why did you send the wrong husband?
- What?
We've delivered your husband home.
That's it.
Your husband's a lawyer, right?
No, chaudhary, my
husband's the doctor. - What?
He's a doctor.
- Exactly.
You fool, you delivered the
lawyer instead of the doctor.
It's okay, keep the lawyer.
- What?
He will earn more than the doctor.
You never do anything right.
Your beards have grown white...
...but haven't learnt any sense.
Uncle
have you gone crazy?
Why are you ranting "uncle, uncle"?
Uncle. Come here.
Why so restless?
Why are you ranting "uncle, uncle"?
I have an idea.
It won't take me long to
knock some sense in you.
At least listen to me first.
Trying to knock some
sense in me for no reason.
There's so much
confusion in your setup.
Don't talk too much.
Go mind your own business.
I was doing just that.
My mother drove me out
of the kitchen. - Mother?
Aunt asked me to call her mother.
By the way, how long have
you been doing this business?
I started when i was 18.
Day after i will be 60.
Day after you'll be 60.
And soon you'll be 80.
You will have to bring a
change in business sometime.
What do you mean?
- Sit.
Those who come here...
...stay for at least two-three weeks.
I mean you must
provide for their food.
Three meals a day, a cot for resting.
Table lamp and a 100 watt bulb.
I am sure you pay for table,
fan and light bill...
...or do you get
electricity illegally.
Do you understand what i am saying?
You provide three meals a day.
Do you know how much
clarified butter's used?
I just saw.
They use one tin just for a lentil.
I was saying, those who
stay back for so long...
...should pay interest,
shouldn't they?
What are you saying?
I should appoint an accountant now...
...to keep a record of
who comes and who goes?
The accountant's right in your hands.
This is a telephone.
- It's a unique phone, uncle.
Do you know the features that it has?
What is feature called in hindi?
I understand that much.
I can make and
receive telephone calls.
What other feature does it have?
Give me your phone.
Give it. I won't run away with it.
Hey you.
- I was just joking.
Look. This is a organizer.
The day your guest comes in...
...feed in his name
along with the date.
Give ten days time to his family,
for the delivery.
Ten days later the alarm
will sound automatically...
...whose delivery is due when.
If the money arrives in
10 days, then its fine...
...otherwise start charging interest.
Now i will feed my name.
I arrived on 31st october.
That means this month is over.
You have demanded 1.5
million from father.
It will take the
entire month of november...
...to gather 1.5 million.
Then comes december.
Won't we celebrate
christmas together in december?
Then comes january.
Yes, i will feed 26th january in here.
It's an auspicious day.
But you will charge me
interest only after 26th january.
Just so that there's no confusion...
...let's click a photo and
save it along with the name.
Here.
Smile.
Superb.
You did understand...
what i said, didn't you?
Think about it.
That girl seems very intelligent.
Demand 500,000 more.
Mister, this is wrong.
Look, first chaudhary
sir demand 1.5 million.
Now he's asking for two.
How will i arrange
for that kind of money?
Tell chaudhary sir...
listen...
mini, why are you
getting so valuable by the day?
One, two, three, four...
five, six, seven, eight...
what are you doing?
That's not the way to do it.
Wait. Stop.
One, two, three, four...
mini!
Mini!
Why do you keep ranting
her name the entire day?
Is she your wife?
No, she's my responsibility.
Responsibility or girlfriend.
- What did you say?
What are you doing?
Your responsibility is upstairs.
She's making the boys work out.
Quiet.
Do it properly.
One, two, three, four...
one, two, one...
one, two, one...
one, two...
one, two, one...
one, two, one...
what are you doing?
Do it along with me.
One, two, three, four...
one, two...
minnie.
- Hi, chotu.
What are you making them do?
Look at their condition.
They will die.
Chotu, they have
blown up hogging on food.
And they do only one exercise.
Up-down, up-down, up-down.
Just watch.
In ten days i will turn them
into john abraham in underwear.
Minnie. Minnie. Minnie.
You're not here for 10 days.
Why, chotu?
Why are you calling me chotu?
Everyone calls you chotu at home.
And i am family now as well.
And i don't hate you as well.
Chotu.
Let's go from here, come on.
- Okay.
Let go off my hand.
Mini...
look, tonight i will come for you.
- On a horse?
Minni, listen carefully.
Be ready, okay.
As a bride?
- Why don't you understand?
It's very important for
you to go back to your house.
Earlier you were
saying "don't go back home".
"You will have to marry sunny."
Now you want to send me back home.
With that same sunny.
I don't want you to get
married to someone else.
I mean with sunny.
Look, i am coming for you tonight.
Just be ready.
I will go with you on one condition.
Do you agree?
- What's the condition?
You will come on a
sparkling white horse.
And you will take me along
in a flower decorated car.
So... will you marry... a useless...
rickshaw driver?
Don't underestimate chotu so much?

Let's run away. This
is a good opportunity.
Mini.
Mini.
Mini, get up.
Mini.
Mini.
Mini.
Mini.
It's easy to wake up
someone who's sleeping.
But impossible to wake up...
...those who have turned a blind-eye.
Mini. Mini.
Fine. I am leaving.
Viren, you.
But why are we running?
This place is so cool.
It's important to leave from here...
i... i...
uncle.
She was running away. I
arrived at the right time.
You should keep a watch.
What if she had escaped?
Not just the loss.
But father would've been defamed.
And you.
Don't you dare try to escape again?
Take care of her.
Goodnight.
Mother.
Shall i take it, for father?
You will serve him food.
Fine, take it.
Wait, wait, wait.
Cover your head.
Chaudhary's slightly old-fashioned.
This way.
This organizer is a great thing.
Wow.
Great. Really helpful.
The food's really tasty.
Who cooked it?
- Uncle, i did.
You?
- Did you like it?
Did you poison it?
Uncle, why don't you
say something nice?
Mother was saying she has
become brazen living with you.
Eat it.
It's nice.
So am i
chaudhary.
Look, today i have
brought in foreign trade.
Jatta, that's really amazing.
What are you doing?
Quiet.
He's speaking a
different kind of english.
Guest is god.
What are you blabbering?
What are you doing?
He's a guest of our country.
He's here to see the
beauty of our country.
Will people come here
from foreign countries...
...it helps our country progress.
They bring more business.
That's why.
That's why we abducted him.
He's a poor man.
He doesn't have any money.
A foreigner without money.
What are you saying?
Not every foreigner is rich.
He's a postman in his country.
He works hard for six months...
...and the remaining months
he travels around the world.
What do you want?
That, when he travels
to other countries...
...he defames our country.
He defames chaudhary.
Sorry, uncle, for taking your name.
You two go and set him free.
Chaudhary, what is she saying?
She is absolutely right.
Go and take our guest back...
...to from wherever
you brought him from.
Chaudhary, we'll have to go
to laddak to take him back.
Listen, show him simla on the way.
Otherwise i will slap you.
What are you saying?
My aunt died years ago.
How will i bring her back now?
Now, you are free.
Go and see india.
You free.
Take him back.
Jatta.
She cooks food well.
She speaks the new
kind of english as well.
Demand for 500,000 more.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday dear chaudhary.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
You were born in a zoo.
With the monkeys and donkeys.
And we have a friend like you.
What is she singing?
Father... she must be praising you.
So?
I...
i will go see the decorations.
Wait, wait, wait.
I will come along as well.
Sister-in-law, i am coming too.
Sister-in-law?
What is going on here?
Where is the entire
family running off to?
Sweet.
Father, cakes are normally sweet.
Not the cake, you dimwit.
The girl's sweet.
That she is.
She's intelligent as well.
She speaks different
kind of english as well.
She cooks well too.
Cooking.
Marry her.
You don't look after my business.
I feel she will manage my
business after i pass away.
That's why.
That's why i can't marry
her even though i want to.
I don't want to thrive
on such a living, father.
Stop looking for
benefits in everyone, father.
Dhani.
Try the kebabs.
They are delicious.
No, sister-in-law.
I am vegetable today.
It's vegetarian.
Sister-in-law,
sometimes you speak rubbish.
Come quickly, the show's
about to start. - Yes, come on.
Where are you going?
The women from our family...
...don't take part in such programs.
We'll watch from above. Come on.
Come on.

Or do you want a tight slap?
"When you smile, your lips turn red."
"When you shy away,
it feels so sweet."
"The girl in green
dress is full of love."
"Look here, even i am full of life."
"The girl in green
dress is full of love."
"Look here, even i am full of life."
"She just turned from one to ten."
"I've become your fan."
"I've become your fan."
"I've become your fan, sweetheart."
"I've become your fan."
"I've become your fan."
"I've become your fan."
Are you the girl's father?
Oh no, mr.
Chaudhary. I am minni's papa.
What have you
thought about her future?
I had thought of getting my
daughter married with grandeur.
But now the situation is...
...that i will get her
married tomorrow itself...
...and send her to canada.
After that whatever i am left with...
i am not concerned about you.
Dhani, bring the girl here
mother, i don't want to go.
Please tell uncle.
I haven't even learnt to cook yet.
Look, dear. Your father
is here to take you back.
But i don't want to go.
You will have to go, dear.
Dhani.
Dhani.
Here. These are yours.
When we go to delhi
buy another pair for me.
But if i leave now how
will we both go to delhi?
Tell uncle. I don't want to go.
Brother naidu.
You're fighting for
women's equality, aren't you?
If i leave then how will
you get my valuable vote?
Don't send me back, please.
Please, brother naidu. Please.
Will you do as i say?
Your father is your well-wisher.
You will have to go.
All the very best.
I've always seen people happy
when they're released from here.
You're the first one who is sad.
Won't you go back home, dear?
Mini. What are you doing there?
Come here.
Have you lost your mind?
Lower your voice.
What are you doing here? Come here.
Will you marry my chotu?
Do you see everyone's sad faces?
They all know that she
doesn't want to leave.
All you have to do is say "yes"...
...and everyone will be happy again.
Then no one can take
her away from here.
Just say no.
No, father.
Let her go.
It's for her best.
How are you, dear?
Is everything fine?
Come on. Let's go home.
Dear.
Ask your father to take
the ransom money back.
And get you married with grandeur.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Mini.
- Please.
Your share of the money.
From today nothing exists between us.
Everything's finished, viren.
"Why has my heart decided to
let these distances crop up?"
What was that? What did you do?
Come on.
Just a minute.
I was forgetting this.
"It doesn't know how
it will survive..."
"...after parting ways with you."
Today you have made me
suffer the biggest loss ever.
This time it was more
emotional than financial.
"I am floored."
"I am floored."
"What is my fault?"
"All my wishes stayed unfulfilled."
"All my dreams were shattered."
"O beloved."
"O beloved."
"O beloved. O beloved."
"O beloved."
"O beloved."
"O beloved. O beloved."
Dhani.
Dhani... has mother woken up?
One has to sleep first to get up.
And no one has slept the entire night.
Move aside, i am busy.
Move aside.
Nonsense.
How are you feeling
after being released?
She must be feeling nice.
Ask one by one.
One question.
- Yes, you ask.
Your father is getting you married...
...as soon as you returned.
How do you feel?
"How are you feeling?"
Are you married?
How did you feel?
Nice, didn't you?
Similarly, she's feeling nice as well.
How did chaudhary treat you?
"How did they treat her?"
How did they treat her!
They were making her
dance when i reached there.
Strange...
- he's lying.
Mini, what are you saying?
They treated me like their daughter.
- Mini.
I stayed back willingly.
Dhani and brother naidu
looked after me really well.
And mother.
A mother is a mother after all.
So you saw. This is
chaudhary's terror.
Even after being released, people...
you should have stopped her, chotu.
Whatever happened wasn't right.
Mother.
Mother.
Mother.
Mother.
What is wrong with all of you?
What do you all think?
I am very happy
sending mini back home.
Do i look happy?
Do i?
And you.
You know everything, mother.
I left this house six years ago.
I never came back.
I don't want to
thrive on such a living.
I drive a rickshaw in the city.
I barely make my ends
meet but i am happy.
She's getting
married in a nice family.
So let her.
Mini will be happy.
I don't even have a place to live.
Where would i have taken her?
Why? Isn't this your house?
I would've looked
after her really well.
And turned her into a renegade.
Which house are you talking about?
This?
You are talking
about this 'agva house'.
Where there's a thief, a cheat and...
- raavan.
Isn't that what you want to say?
A raavan who abducts people.
You've given my introduction.
Now let me tell you about yourself.
You're a coward.
Listen.
The one you call thief,
isn't stealing...
that's called tricking.
There's a difference between the two.
Do you know what she wants to be?
She wants to be a magician.
And if you think what
she's doing is wrong...
...then why didn't you fulfill
the responsibility of a brother.
You should've showed
her the right path.
But you ran away.
And the one who runs away
from his responsibilities...
...people call him a coward.
With what right do
you call naidu a cheat?
You fool.
All ministers aren't corrupt.
The youngsters from
neighboring states...
...roam around jobless and inebriated.
And the youngsters of hariyana.
Best in sports.
Best in relay.
Best in boxing.
Best in wrestling. Best in 'kabaddi'.
And who is responsible for it?
Naidu and ministers like naidu.
How do you call him a cheat?
I admit they're not your kin.
That's why you don't love them.
Father...
- but i am your father.
You're my blood.
You've a problem with my earning.
And when you were younger...
...you would fly paper airplanes...
...cruise around on the
motorcycle with the same money.
Then you would sing praises
like "my father's the best".
And when you grew up...
...you had a problem with my earning.
Why didn't you say then...
..."look, father. Your
son's grown up now".
"We will work hard, we'll
have one square meal a day...
...but lead a life of dignity."
When it was time to
fulfill your duty as a son...
...you ran away.
Anyone who runs away from
his responsibility as a son...
...is called a coward.
And this time the
biggest responsibility...
...that you ran away from is
the responsibility of love.
That girl fell in love with you.
That responsibility.
Who do you think you are?
You don't look like salman khan.
Nor are you rich as the
tata's or the ambani's.
Still that girl wants to marry you.
And the one who runs from the
responsibility of marriage...
what is the time, father?
- What?
What is the time?
2:15.
Where are you running off to?
I am going to fulfill my
responsibility, father.
What do you mean?
Your blood will show its true
color for the first and last time.
What are you going to do?
To abduct her.
Jatta.
Get the car.
Father.
We will work hard, have
one square meal a day...
...but lead a life of dignity.
That's more like it.
Did i say too much?
"I am floored."
"I am floored."
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
Great.
"I am floored."
Come, dear.
Hold this, dear.
"I am floored."
The boy will now adorn the
'mangalsutra' to the girl.
Now the boy will grace the
girl's forehead with vermillion.
"O beloved."
"O beloved."
So, son. Got your green card.
Straight to canada.
Get the car.
I will miss your mischiefs.
Look after yourself.
Come. Come on.
Sir, one group photo.
Yes.
- Come on.
Sir, smile.
Very nice, sir.
Smile, sir.
Viren.
- Sparkling...
what are you doing in the car?
Sparkling...
- you're here?
Sparkling...
- you're here.
That means you took the
nuptial rounds. - Sparkling...
then where's sunny?
Mini.
Can i speak now?
- Yes.
I came on a sparkling horse.
I am taking you away in
car decorated with flowers.
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
Chotu.
Open the door.
First dance for me.
Stop it, open the door...
first dance for me.
Thank god.
She's leaving happily.
It's the grace of god.
No, no, not this one.
Come on, open the door.
Do the michael jackson step.
No.
- Yes.
I will sing as well.
Hurry.
Come on, come on.
- Come on, hurry up.
Why are you hitting me?
Because you made me cry a lot.
Actually, after you left...
- yes.
I thought a lot.
What will i say to you?
How will i live without you?
Viren, don't bore me.
We're married, and now
you're proposing me.
I love you.
Chotu, now you are kidnapping me.
You always said i don't have that.
That?
- Yes, that.
What's that?
Adventure.
Chandra chur.
Shall we go?
- Where?
'Agva house.'
Hurry up, or do you want a slap?
They are very mischievous.
They took the car.
After all, whose children are they?
