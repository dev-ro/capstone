- Anna.
- I'm trying.
Don't rush me!
- Hurry.
- Five seconds left.
- I know!
- Four. Three.
Two.
One.
Time's up.
He's coming.
It's going to kill us..
Like the others.
No. He can't.
We're safe as long
as we stay in the circle.
Where is he?
Do you see him?
[thud]
I don't want to play
this game anymore.
None of us do.
This game is over!
[intense music]
Not yet.
I don't want to die..
Mary. Mary!
Get back in the circle,
quick!
It's going to get me.
Mary, get back in the circle!
- No, I can't.
- Mary, get back
in the circle!
- Mary! Mary!
- Anna, help me!
- Come on!
- It's going to get me!
- Aah!
- Anna, help me!
No, not the dark!
No! No! No!
[Mary screaming]
Anna, fix the circle, quick!
[screaming continues]
There.
Mary?
[dramatic music]
You can't hurt us.
We're in the circle.
The candle is lit.
It's... it's almost 3:33.
We won.
You have to leave.
It's the rules.
We followed the rules!
The game is over!
[music continues]
[indistinct whispering]
[indistinct whispering]
You lose.
Help me. Help me.
- Aah!
- Run!
[intense music]
Shh.
Listen?
What is it?
I thought..
He's coming.
- We have to hide.
- He'll find us.
[Anna screaming]
[both panting]
[ticking]
[sobbing]
I'm so scared.
Shh.
Where is he?
[Anna screaming]
Come on!
Wait! It's against
the rules.
Forget the rules, Anna.
We have to escape.
Now's our chance.
He'll kill you, like the others.
Anna, please.
It's just a game.
We have to go now!
You can't leave
the house! It's a rule!
Anna, come on!
You can't leave the house!
It's against the rules.
We have to go! Anna!
Max! No!
No! Max!
No! No!

- Grandma Anna?
- No.
[sighs]
- Let's get you
back to bed.
- No. No.
Thank God you don't sleepwalk.
I'd never find you
in this house.
[Anna sobbing]
[gasps]
Did I scare you?
No.
What are you doing up so late?
Checking on you, young lady.
Speaking of which,
you should be in bed.
Doctor's orders.
I'm not a young lady.
And look,
it's only 8:20.
It's early.
Okay, come on.
Let's get you back
in bed.
Don't touch me.
Okay, well,
the doctor said
you need to sleep, so..
Come on, can you please
go to bed?
What are you gonna do?
Grams, you need to go to bed.
- Come on.
- Don't put your hands
on me!
- Come on, grams.
- I'm coming.
I don't want the covers.
It's too hot.
Come on, please.
Make sure you do your rounds.
Doors locked.
The windows sealed tight.
And you be mindful
of the rose garden.
Since your grandpa passed
it has never been the same.
Okay, if you need
anything, just call.
Thank you for coming, Alex.
I don't think I could
do this without you.
Of course you could.
You're a tough chick.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Thank you for finding
my burettes.
Of course, grams.
[cell phone ringing]
Hey, stranger.
It's Friday night.
Yeah. Again.
- So, what's up?
- Just killing time.
You?
YouTubin'.
[scoffs]
As always.
There's this crazy video
with this guy
and this cat.
I can't stop watching it.
I don't know
why he's doing this.
- Aw.
- What?
I just broke
one of the wax flowers.
I don't know what that means.
So you want some
company tonight?
Like old times.
Yeah, come over
around 10:00?
Plan.
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.
Want to watch
a movie or something?
Your grandma finally get a TV?
Nope.
I keep forgetting that.
By the way,
it's so awesome that
you're back in town.
Sorry about your grandma though.
She getting any better?
No. Just older.
But everything happens
for a reason, right?
Um, not really,
but you can pretend
that's true.
I won't stop you.
So, how did you
get roped
into nurse duty?
I mean, it's cool
you're doing it and all
but what about your school?
School can wait.
And to answer your
real question..
I guess I just love her.
Besides, it's not like
she has anybody else.
Only you, Alex.
Only you.
Hello?
What are you doing?
Fixing stuff.
Perfect.
[Anna screaming]
Nonsense!
I have every right!
- Hey, I gotta go.
- Don't you tell me..
All good.
I'll see you later.
Oh, don't forget
to leave the front door
open for me.
Yeah, will do. Bye.

[dramatic music]
Nana?
Everything okay in here?
Alex?
What is it, dear?
It's nothing, I just..
I thought
I heard something.
Do you need something?
No, not really.
Miles is coming over tonight.
I always liked that Miles boy.
Don't really care
for the rest of them.
The rest of who, nana?
There is no rest of them.
Not likely.
Do you remember my roses?
I do.
I remember the roses.
I remember my roses.
My roses.
[crying]
Oh.
I haven't tended
to them in years.
Oh, how I loved my flowers.
Sometimes..
People forget..
Painful memories.
They push them aside
for new ones.
For better ones.
Okay, well, are you sure
you don't need anything?
I'm fine.
Really.
Okay.
Alex?
There is one thing.
Could you fetch me my
hand mirror, please?
Sure.
You won't find it there
among my things.
It's not there.
Do you remember where it is?
I do.
It just came to me.
I can picture it
in my mind,
clear as a bell
one of my favorite things.
Besides you
and your mother,
of course.
God rest her soul.
Oh, how I loved
my silver vanity mirror.
The last time I recall seeing it
it was in
Grandpa Luster's
travel chest.
Where's that?
Why, it's in the attic,
of course,
where it's always been.
What is the matter with you?
Okay. I'll try
and find it for you.
[water dripping]
This place is falling apart.
[clocks ticking]

[clock bell dings]
[dings]
[music continues]
[intense music]
[indistinct whispering]
Please don't be the boogeyman.
Shit!
Okay, now you're scarier
than the boogeyman.
Let's just cover you back up.
There you are.
[instrumental music]
[music continues]
[music continues]
Boo.
Really, Miles?
I made it.
- When did you get
so jumpy?
- Jumpy?
What's all this stuff?
How did you know
I was in the attic?
The light was on,
I saw it when I drove up.
Look, I'm here now,
so everything is cool.
Guns.
And knives.
You hit the mother load.
Yeah, well,
I was looking for this.
Okay?
Don't ask. Grandma.
Got it.
You know, come to
think of it, your grandma
never let us
come up here that much
when we were little.
- Did she?
- No, not really.
It was always off limits.
Can you help me
put this stuff away?
You think this thing works?
I don't know. Maybe.
I found these.
No. I know
what you're thinking
and the answer is "No."
Absolutely no way.
I'm not stupid.
Hey, we should totally
call Kelly.
I know for a fact she's
staying home tonight.
Unless, of course,
you're not into it.
Maybe.
She still practicing goth?
Yeah, sorta.
Well, kinda.
No. No, not really, no.
Okay. Cool.
Hey, what do you think of this?
It's heavy.
And there's definitely
stuff in it.
I want to know what's inside.
Well, it looks like
somebody really didn't
want it opened.
Like ever.
- Is it bad?
- Is what bad?
- If we open it?
- I don't know.
It could be nothing.
It could be a stash of money
or your granny's
favorite childhood toy
or it could be something
you're not supposed to see.
So, it's totally up to you.
But I say we do it.
- Open it.
- Why me?
'Cause then I won't
be lying when I say
I didn't do it.
Good thinking.
Salt shaker.
A candle.
A pencil.
Okay, we're safe.
None of this
changes my opinion
of grandma.
[dramatic music]
Wait. Is this blood?
What?
Yeah.
It is blood.
"Anna?"
That's granny..
"Max?"
Who?
My grandma had a brother.
His name was Maximilian,
Max for short.
She never talked about him much.
I think he died of polio
or something.
Wow.
Look who I found.
"Max Luster, age ten.
Fear,
scared of spiders."
"Mary Wellington, age nine.
Fear,
scared of the dark."
"Josh Christopher, age ten.
Fear,
scared of drowning."
Weird.
No!
You've opened the game!
- Grams?
- Holy shit.
Thank you so much for coming.
Is she gonna be alright?
Oh, yes, I am confident
she'll recover.
Storm is really moving in.
Ah. Good. Thank you
for fetching my bag.
- What's that for?
- Um..
I'm not quite sure actually.
Allen, the stethoscope,
if you please.
Yes, of course, Doctor Harding.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
And, uh, if you would be
so good as to prepare
an injection?
- Yes.
- 25 CC only.
Injection?
It's a vitamin cocktail really.
Nothing too serious.
Your grandmother
has been taking them
for years.
It helps with the dementia.
I have never seen her
so scared..
Up in the attic..
It was..
It was really creepy.
Well, uh,
Anna should be just fine.
She has a strong heart.
Alex, um, look
I know this has been hard on you
but you must understand that, uh
sometimes getting old..
Well, it's just not
that much fun.
She's resting now
she should be
right as rain
in the morning.
Allen, you finish up here.
Yes, sir.
Any other instructions?
No, no, uh..
Just join us, uh,
downstairs
when you're done here.
Miles, Alex?
Can we have a word downstairs?
Sure.
You said she fainted
in the attic?
Yeah.
We, uh, carried her back to bed.
The attic?
I still can't believe
Anna made it that far.
She hasn't left her room
in years.
Perhaps it might be a good idea
if you would lock
her door
from the inside.
Now, I... I... I know
that sounds rather harsh
but, uh, even wandering
around one's own home
can be extremely dangerous.
Especially in this old house.
Ah, so, uh,
I took the liberty of
writing down my
private office number.
Give me a call on Monday,
we'll talk.
Will do.
You're a very blessed
woman, Ms. Luster.
I hope my little boy
treats me the way
your granddaughter treats you.
Sleep well.
[door creaks]
Everything alright, Allen?
Yes. She was sleeping
soundly when I left her.
I put a bottle of aspirin
at the end of the table
for you
in case she wakes up
a little sore.
I would also recommend
perhaps a nice hot bath
with a little bit
of Epsom salt..
Does wonders for
soothing the occasional
bump and bruise.
Sound advice, doctor.
And in the meantime,
just, uh, keep an eye out
on your grandmother.
She can be
pretty stubborn,
as you know.
Uh, she's sleeping now,
so I'm guessing you'll
have an easy night of it.
Alexandra..
You're doing a good thing here.
Your mother would be proud.
The world lost
a fine soul
the day she passed
and for that, I am truly sorry.
Thank you, Doctor Harding.
Means a lot.
Shall we?
[door opens]
Goodnight.
Strong as a horse.
Yes, she is.
You never told me
the story behind her.
Oh, not much to tell.
Old family, old money.
To be sure, they've had
more than their fair
share of sorrow.
How so?
How sorrow can take
many shapes and forms.
I never would have guessed.
This family hides it so well.
- Their sadness, that is.
- Hmm.
Indeed they do.
Indeed they do.
[sighs]
Wow.
Now what?
I don't know.
Nana said,
"You opened the game."
What game?
What'd she mean?
Did you see that look
on her face when she saw
what we were doing?
Are you kidding?
I wish I hadn't.
She was terrified.
Yeah, but of what?
[intense music]
[music continues]
[creaking]
Some candles.
A salt shaker.
A pencil.
A sewing needle.
The rules.
This is the game.
The rules.
"The midnight game."
My! I guess that solves
that mystery.
Does it?
I mean..
It doesn't look like a fun game.
Where's the dice?
I don't think it's
that kind of game.
Listen to this.
"To call the Midnight Man
into your house
"you must follow
these steps precisely.
"First, you must
write your name down
on a piece of paper.
"Then, using a needle,
prick your finger.
"Place a single drop
of blood
next to your name.
Light a candle
and turn out
all the house lights."
[intense music]
"Attach the paper
with your name
and blood mark on it
"to the front door
of your house.
"It must be the front door
"and the door
must be made of wood.
"Here's where
it gets complicated.
"At midnight
and not a moment sooner
"knock 22 times on the door.
"You must complete
this step before
the final stroke
of midnight."
[clock chiming]
[groaning]
One. Two. Three.
[Anna groaning]
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight. Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen. Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
Twenty.
Twenty-one..
[Anna gasps]
Twenty-two.
Okay. Now, go outside
and blow out your candle.
[door opens]
Quickly, get back inside.
We have to relight it.
What happens now?
Let me check the rules.
"The Midnight Man
is now in your house.
Avoid him at all costs
until 3:33."
That's it?
- Did we do it right?
- Something's missing.
- What?
- I don't know.
It just says,
"You must never fall"
and then the page is torn.
What now?
Let's check the box.
[intense music]
[door creaking]
It's got to be there.
You know my grandma,
she's practically
a hoarder.
I don't know, Alex.
I've checked everything.
This might be a loss.
Keep looking.
Red is the color of roses.
- Red..
- I should go
check on her.
Squeeze the life
right out of her.
Squeeze the life..
Creepy.
Do you, um,
want me to come with you?
After all,
the Midnight Man
is out there.
Waiting.
Is he?
I'll be okay.
Be right back.
Oh, Alex, take a candle.
What for?
In case we got it right.
The candle part was
in the rules. Remember?
Right.
Stay alive.
I think I found something.
[chuckles]
I definitely found something.
Nana?
Nana?
[knock on door]
Everything okay in there?
I'm coming in.
You in here?
One. Two..
"You must never fall asleep
"or stay in the
same place
during the game.
If you do,
the Midnight Man
will take you."
Three. Four..
"If your candle blows out
you must relight it
in 10 seconds.."
Five..
"If it doesn't relight,
surround yourself
with a circle of salt
for protection."
Six.
Seven.
"If any of theses rules
are broken
The Midnight Man
will manifest your
worst nightmares."
Oh, Alex!
[knocking]
Grams!
Grams!
Grams!
I've been waiting for you.
- No!
- What's your fear?
No!
No!
No!
It's blood.
[dramatic music]
[indistinct whispering]
No!
[Alex screaming]
[sobbing]
[indistinct whispering]
No!
Shh!
[gasping]
Red is the color of your blood.
It's your blood, Alex!
It's your blood!
[groaning]
[retching]
Bleed!
Bleed!
[gasping]
[screams]
It's your blood!
Your disgusting,
disgusting blood!
Alex.
[Alex groaning]
Alex.
Alex!
[gasping]
Alex! Alex!
Look at me.
Look at me.
It's okay.
It's... it's over.
It's okay.
It's over... it's over.
It's over now.
Alex, look at me.
Look at me, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's all over now.
It's all over.
Okay?
What just happened?
It wasn't real, was it?
Yes, yes, it is real.
What're you doing?
I'm pouring a circle of salt.
Okay. Now,
where's your candle?
- My what?
- Your candle.
Where is it?
- I was checking
on gram...
- No, no, no.
Stay in the circle!
Stay in the circle!
You have to stay here.
Why? What the hell
is going on?
You just have
to trust me, please.
You have to trust me.
I found the rest of the rules.
Alex, we should have
never played this game.
Now, where is your candle?
I set it on the mantle
to come check
on the bathroom.
No. Turn that back on.
What are you doing?
Trust me.
It's safer in the dark.
It's safe!
Now, you just need
to stay in the circle.
I'm gonna
be right back. Okay?
Where's grams?
What happened?
We have to keep moving.
No, you have tell me
what's going on first.
Right here. Right now.
Have you ever heard
of Pandora's box?
Yeah, well, we just opened it.
A really bad version of one
and I promise you that bad stuff
is gonna happen if we stay here.
So, we have to move.
- What about grams?
- She's fine.
She's not playing
the game, so she's safe.
I think.
Okay, we have to move.
Come on. Let's go.
[indistinct whispering]
Alex.
Alex, let's go.
[indistinct whispering]
When you went
to go check on
your grandma..
Here, hold this.
After I found the rules
I tried a little experiment.
I got it, here.
Take this. Take this.
Now you have one,
that's yours, okay?
Listen, Alex. Alex?
If we get separated
for any reason
or if your candle goes out
and you can't relight it
in ten seconds
exactly ten seconds..
You have to stop
what you're doing
and you pour a circle
of salt around you
and you stay in that circle
until you can relight
your candle, okay?
Or what?
[Miles exhales]
I think you know
the answer to that.
What was your experiment?
I blew out my candle.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
[dramatic music]
Alex?
[creaking]
You have to die..
Have to..
You have to die too.
Alex.
I swear to God,
if you're trying
to scare me..
It's working.
[floorboard creaking]
[intense music]
[breathing heavily]
Hello, Miles.
[intense music]
[Miles groans]
Show me your fear.
[Miles groaning]
[Midnight Man growling]
You're afraid of pain.
Perfect.
[Miles coughs]
[Miles gasping]
[groaning]
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Someone else wants to play.
[Miles groaning]
Ah!
Ten.
No!
No!
[breathing heavily]
Okay.
No. No. No.
[breathing heavily]
[exhales]
It's real.
[Alex grunting]
Alex.
Okay, come on.
This is insane.
This can't be happening.
I think it is.
I think it's really happening.
So, what, we're just
stuck in this house
till 3:33 a.m.?
Yes.
[Alex sighs]
Hey.
I tried the front door,
but no answer.
[Alex exhales]
Hey, dork.
Did you, uh, forget
to pay the electric bill?
Kelly, what are you doing here?
I, um,
I invited her before
we started the game.
I didn't think
she would show up
with the snow and all.
Okay, well,
this might not be
the best timing.
Okay..
What have you two been doing?
[dramatic music]
[clocks ticking]
Two hours left.
Wow.
When you guys screw up,
you really screw up.
That's not really helping.
I can't believe you guys
called the Midnight Man.
I mean, that's the kind
of shit that you read
about in Creepypastas.
You've heard
of Creepypastas, right?
It doesn't matter.
From what I know
and from what you've told me
the only way for me
to help is
to join the game.
I don't know.
This isn't a joke, Kelly.
I'm not joking.
This thing you saw,
this Midnight Man..
It uses your fears against you.
Fears you don't
even know you have
until it's too late.
Like subconscious shit.
That's the whole point
of the game.
That's its deal.
[exhales]
Well, we know
that one already.
[exhales]
It's freezing.
When the Midnight Man
is near, your candle
will blow out.
Near? That wasn't
in the rules. Was it?
No, no. I didn't..
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
You guys definitely
need my help.
[both sigh]
Red is the color of roses.
Red is the color of roses.
Red is the color of blood.
Ow.
Kelly, are you sure?
You can still leave.
And leave
my best friends alone
to die?
Besides, it's just a game.
Wait.
No, it's not a game.
It's real.
Right.
You're in.
Now, all we have to do
is avoid
the Midnight Man.
This is gonna be fun.
No, it's not.
Let's keep moving.
[dramatic music]
[door opens]
Do you still have the mirror?
Yeah.
I want to check something out.
[dramatic music]
[water dripping]
This place used
to be beautiful..
Until my mom..
Um, what are we looking for?
I don't know.
I... I just keep thinking
about how she died.
You guys really need
a better plumber.
Wait, did your mom
die in this house?
My mom killed herself
in this house.
[gasping]
Forgive me.
That was the last time
I saw my mother.
Wait a second,
you saw all of this?
- I thought your mom
died in...
- Everybody did.
That was just a story
grams concocted.
She said suicide was
an embarrassing way
to die.
And you never said anything.
I was ten.
I didn't understand
anything until now.
The game, don't you see?
- We found it
in the attic.
- So?
So, what if my mom
found it,
like we did?
What if she played it and lost?
- It's possible.
- And grandma knew
all along.
I just remember grams staring
into that
stupid vanity mirror
all the time.
I mean, even the night
my mom died,
she was so cold.
Not a single tear.
Almost like she was happy.
Wow. I thought my family
was messed up.
- Hey, can I see
the mirror?
- Yeah.
I always thought
grams was just vain.
Staring at herself
in this thing
all the time
but I don't think
she was looking at herself.
I think she was looking
for something else.
He's right behind us.
He's right there.
- There's nothing there.
- No..
- Your... your mind's
just playing...
- No.
I saw him, he was
right there, smiling.
Ah, this is so bad.
We should just keep moving
it's getting cold in here.
[sighs]
It's too late.
Oh, shit!
I have matches.
Come on!
Take my candle.
[dramatic music]
Miles, come on!
We're running
out of time. Come on!
[breathing heavily]
Okay.
Okay, let's just go to the attic
pour out a giant circle of salt
and wait this thing out.
- Will that work?
- We should try.
Yeah.
Shit!
Here take, take this!
Take this.
One. Two.
Three. Four.
Five. Six.
- Come on, Miles!
- Seven..
- The wick is wet,
it won't light!
- Eight.
- Dammit!
- Dammit!
- This isn't working!
- What do I do?
- Don't panic!
W... what does that mean,
don't panic?
Build a circle
of protection
around you right now!
- Okay?
- Okay.
[intense music]
Okay. Did I make it?
Am I safe?
W... what do we do now?
There's candles
in the dining room.
- We'll go get one.
- Yeah, yeah.
What? No,
somebody stay with me.
No, we can't stay in one place.
We have to keep moving.
No, wait.
You guys are just
playing with me, right?
Listen, just stay
in the circle, okay?
We're gonna be right back.
Okay?
We're gonna be right back.
Okay, but hurry.
We will.
I'm serious.
[music continues]
What is it?
How could she let this happen?
What's the game still
doing in this house?
I saw something
in my grandma's bathroom.
And it really scared me,
and I really thought
that I was gonna die.
Until that moment,
I didn't really know
what that meant.
To die.
But I know now.
I don't care
what happens to me..
But I do care
what happens to you.
Alex... you know
I have always..
[music continues]
Okay.
We have to destroy the game.
Burn it. Throw it away.
I don't care.
But, Miles, we can't
let anybody else die.
How could we? I mean..
There could be
a thousand different boxes
like your grandmother's
in a thousand
different attics
all over the place.
Well, at least we can
destroy it in this one.
[music continues]
Oh, this is bullshit.
I'm not scared of you.
You hear me, Midnight Man?
You're a game.
An internet urban legend.
You don't even exist.
And even if you do exist..
I'm protected.
I'm within the circle.
That's a rule.
You can't break that.
[sighs]
I'm not afraid.
You should be.
Alex?
Miles?
Guys!
No one is coming for you.
[intense music]
Oh, my God.
No, not God.
I'm protected.
Yes, the salt.
You can't do that,
it's cheating!
Try and stop me.
[music continues]
Two can play at that game.
Yes!
You see that, you fucking freak!
Clever girl.
I thought you said
your grandma kept
extra candles.
She does. I saw them,
they were right here.
Unless she took them?
Your grandma? No, no, she
couldn't have taken them
because we'd locked
her door, remember?
We should get back
to Kelly and go to
the attic like you said.
I'll grab your
grandfather's gun.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
[intense music]
Dr. Harding?
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for you.
We need to talk.
There's some things
you need to hear
about your grandmother.
About me.
About The Midnight Man.
You're playing the game,
aren't you?
Well, that is most unfortunate.
[music continues]
I can wait you out all night.
You can't touch me.
You must be punished!
[screams]
[intense music]
I see your fear now.
Kelly.
Kelly.
Is that you?
How do you know my name?
You killed me.
How could I forget you?
You slit my throat.
You're lying.
No!
Now, it's your turn
to feel the blade.
[intense music]
[whimpering]
[groaning]
[gagging]
You're not dead yet.
I'm not dead.
I... I'm not dead.
[panting]
Miles!
Alex!
My God! There's
three of you playing?
Our friend, Kelly.
We had to leave her though
but she's in the circle
of protection.
Her candle went out.
That's what we were looking for.
Another candle.
I'm afraid,
that's not how it works.
Your friend is in grave danger.
Wait, how do you know
so much about the game?
[sighs]
I was in the attic
the night that your grandmother
played the game the first time.
[screams]
Run!
[whimpering]
I see you.
She'd invited me over,
but... then..
She wouldn't let me play.
Said it was
for the big kids only.
Anna was the only one
that survived that night.
[sighs]
But she still plays the game..
Over and over
unable to stop.
She's trapped somehow
in the Midnight Man's clutches.
She has been supplying him
with players ever since.
Why?
I'm sorry, Alex,
I... I honestly
don't know.
But one thing I know for certain
this is no game for kids
or bored teenagers.
The Midnight Man
is utterly ruthless.
He's some kind of Pagan entity.
It only knows punishment.
You mean, he's an executioner?
Yes, and I fear..
I fear it's only
gonna get worse.
How could this
possibly get worse?
The Midnight Man
doesn't like to lose.
What does that mean?
He, uh, tends to bend
the rules sometimes.
You mean he cheats?
Yes. And he's very,
very good at it.
Did you say your friend
is in another room of the house?
Yeah.
Good. Good.
Perhaps, she can
keep him occupied while
while we go to the attic
and destroy the game.
We can't just leave her as bait.
I'm, I'm afraid
she's no longer bait.
She's the appetizer.
[whimpering]
[intense music]
Kelly!
Liar! Liar!
I know your secret.
I don't wanna play
this game anymore.
Your tears mean nothing, Kelly.
Liar, liar.
Where are you going, Kelly?
You killed me.
You can't run, Kelly, remember?
Are you sad now, Kelly?
Stop it.
You murdered me.
Stop it!
Murderer.
No!
Now, it's your turn.
Leave me alone!
Shut up!
I want to show you something.
[instrumental music]
Your game is over.
No.
[groaning]
No!
Kelly!
She's gone.
- Oh, shi..
- Oh, my God!
Taken.
This is what happens
when you lose the game.
We have to get to the attic now.
That's where you started
the game, right?
That's where you found the box?
- Yeah.
- Alright.
We're running out of time here.
Let's end this.
[intense music]
Quickly now.
We must finish this.
Do what you need to do.
- What are you doing?
- I just have to know.
[music continues]
It's true.
"Annie Luster, age 30.
Fear of heights."
Please just d... don't
hurt my daughter.
Do it.
- I can't.
- Do it.
Take your life.
Father, forgive me.
Look at her.
[groaning]
Look at her!
My mom didn't kill herself.
She was murdered by my grandma.
She tricked her
into playing the game.
Like you said, she's been
supplying the Midnight Man
with players knowing
what could happen.
And she sent me up here
to get her mirror
knowing I would find the box.
And she knew I would open it.
None of that matters now.
You need to surround yourselves
with the salt.
Make a... a circle
of protection.
Fast!
Wait, how much time is left?
Just, just hurry.
All that matters now
is that you both survive.
Easier said than done.
Anna.
Anna, no more.
Please, just listen to me.
This must stop now!
I beg of you!
Why did you do it?
Why did you kill her,
your own daughter?
How could you?
She was a thief
and a liar and a whore!
She deserved to be punished.
And I got picked to punish her.
Don't listen to her, Alex.
That's not your
grandmother anymore.
What?
He's here.
He's using her for a conduit.
Is, is the circle finished?
Shit, the candles are out.
Shi..
There's one left.
It's okay 'cause
we're in the circle.
We're in the circle.
We're in the salt.
We're in the salt.
Dr. Harding,
get in the circle.
No! It doesn't
work for me.
I... I'm not in the game.
He can't hurt me.
Tommy?
Annie.
My Annie.
[screaming]
Dr. Harding!
[groaning]
No!
[screaming]
Stop!
Stop it.
Nana, stop!
[gunshot]
I said stop!
[sobbing]
[intense music]
I don't wanna hurt you.
I didn't,
I didn't wanna hurt you.
I was just a little girl.
Just like you.
And my mom said that you,
that you had to die too.
My mommy said
that you have to die too.
You have to be dead too.
You have to be dead too!
Be dead too!
You should be fucking afraid.
[screams]
[gunshot]
[intense music]
[whimpering]
It's over.
It's over.
Is it?
Not yet.
[music continues]
[clock chiming]
The half hour mark!
It's 3:30.
Three more minutes.
We made it.
[music continues]
You've lost.
We won.
[music continues]
I am so sad!
[music continues]
[instrumental music]
[water dripping]
[music continues]
[clock tolling]
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
[sighs]
It's 4 a.m.
It's 4:00.
We made it.
It's over.
You sacrificed yourself for us.
[music continues]
Let's destroy this game
and get out of here.
[instrumental music]
The Midnight Man
doesn't like to lose.
Sometimes he, uh,
tends to bend the rules.
It's not 3:33 yet.
[music continues]
Miles, no!
No!
No!
There is no escape!
[music continues]
Your tears mean nothing to me.
Your game is over.
[grunting]
[music continues]
- Dad?
- Yeah.
You knew the people
that lived here?
Yes, I did.
What happened to them?
Sorrow happened.
[sighs]
Can I have this?
Let me see.
I don't see why not.
Looks harmless.
Cool.
- Should we go?
- Yeah.
So, what do you think
is in there?
I don't know.
I hope it's a game.
[instrumental music]
[music continues]
[music continues]
[music continues]
So if you really
go the whole way
and see how you feel
at the prospect
of vanishing forever.
Have all your efforts,
and all your achievements
and all your attainments
turning into dust
and nothingness.
What is the feeling?
There is no feeling.
[music continues]
