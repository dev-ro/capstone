Sound and Cinematography.
It's in me, in you...
It makes terrible waves...
I don't know much, but I know the
innocent don't control this world...
We'll go on, if possible.
I'm not scared, but it's
because I never could...
...never knew how to...
...get involved.
I have to run.
See you later.
I'm the girl, who shouldn't
be called Carmen.
With your body.
When shit's worth money,
the poor won't have assholes.
Well, Mr. Hugues?
When shit's worth money,
the poor won't have assholes.
Yes. We'll write to you!
- Is there a Frenchman in the
house? - Mr. Jean-Pierre!
- Is there a Frenchman in the
house? - Come, we'll write to you.
It's not normal.
Who is it?
Ok, let eternity enter.
My friend, how are you today?
He couldn't be better!
I'll get sick...
If you have no fever
by Friday, you're leaving.
My bill's been paid!
This isn't a hotel.
You'll have to leave!
I'm sure I'll get sick.
You'll leave!
- Do I write that?
- Yes.
Lights out, Mr. Jeannot.
"Badly seen, badly said."
You worked hard today!
That's very good.
- Think so?
- Yes.
Come on...
Don't forget your temperature!.
You might get a fever yet.
If I put my finger in your ass,
and you count to 33... See?
Do, re, mi, fa, sol... See?
I'll have a fever.
Why did you say that?
People don't do what they
feel like these days.
I feel like saying it,
so I do.
Will I get a fever?
Maybe.
To be...
To be...
- In other words, in order to
abolish... - Mr. Jean!
-...ignorance and crime...
- Mr. Godard's room?
must I rage like a storm
and sow evil at random?
- A lousy idea!
- A good idea!
It's time your madness saw
the opposite of all things!
We'll write to you.
Where am I?
Who is this?
Don't you remember me?
Carmen.
- You're Elizabeth's daughter?
- Yes.
Won't you ask why I'm here?
Sure. It could provide dialogue.
Have you some light?
I need your help, Uncle Jean.
It was long ago...
...the last vacation.
- Long ago.
- Yes.
Young people are crazy!
They have great memories,
but they forget anything!
They're in a black hole.
Do you really live here now?
No. Not really.
It's not easy. I have
to get sick every week.
So, you need my help...
That's new!
But this time I mean it.
I do.
"Her great beauty had
already struck me...
Her gentleness,
her honesty..."
No matter where or when,
the classics always work.
Do you still own the
apartment in Trouville?
Of course.
It's paid up until...
the year 2000.
May I use it?
Sure. What for?
It's quite empty, you know.
Some friends and I
are making a movie.
Then it's yes?
It's yes, Uncle Jean?
I met a rich guy.
He wants to see some tests.
So I thought...
...we could shoot them there.
The story takes place by the sea.
Is it yes?
Does the story end happily?
We don't know yet.
Yes, you do.
No! Don't bug me.
You never got along with her.
With whom?
With your mother,
like that Electra kid...
You don't remember.
You have a talent for doom.
How did it end, when...
...the guilty ones in one corner,
the innocent in another?
I don't know.
So, is it yes?
I'll lend you my new camera.
It makes music,
I built it here...
...with the kitchen staff.
Don't you want to go back
to making movies, Uncle Jean?
We should close our eyes,
not open them.
You could help us with
your video equipment.
There's tons of
money to be made.
Shall I ask my friend?
Let's wait and see.
But can I borrow the apartment?
Who'll give me the keys?
The gardener or his wife.
She does the cleaning.
You said it was empty.
So?
I'll keep you posted.
He's agreed.
It's not a good idea.
We wanted perfect timing.
- It is.
- No, we're improvising!
Clara makes too many mistakes.
I'm aware of it.
I realize it, fully.
Life isn't the greatest good.
Of all evils,
mistakes are the worst.
- Hi, Claire.
- Where is my brother?
He went to buy cigarettes.
Is it really for me?
Why?
It's cold, isn't it?
How is it going?
Tell him about Saturday...
You tell him!
My sister's invited you
for dinner on Saturday.
I can't.
I have a training session.
He should change jobs!
You should. I told my father
will get you another job.
Yes.
I'll take Claire home,
then I'll drop you off.
Coffee break! If anything's
not normal, call me.
What's not normal?
Everything!
Be more mysterious...
The chord shorter?
No, it develops and there
it becomes more tragic...
The second violin and the
alto must be louder...
We'll take it from D...
Move on, goddammit!
- Can I have your autograph?
- Move on!
- Aren't you Jean Gabin?
- Move on!
- You look just like him.
- Go away!
Video, who wants cassettes?
- Will you keep moving!
- All films in all colors!
PAL, SECAM... all videos.
Keep moving! Shit!
- Go away!
- Help!
Alain!
Freeze! Everyone out!
Down there!
- Hurry! See you in the hall.
- Ok.
- It must be more violent.
- Very well.
Very good...
Once more. The tempo
was a bit slack.
Don't fade so soon...
The phrase on which you fade
is very long...
Right.
"Act, don't ask. "
Yes, it fades on...
"Act!"
"Perform miracles,
before you reveal them. "
"It's the only way to
fulfill your destiny."
Oh, Claire.
Carmen!
Let's get out of here.
Let's leave.
I'll tie you up,
it'll look more real.
- The keys!
- Where are the keys?
They're in the ignition.
Same place?
- Nothing's changed.
- Go away!
- Untie me.
- If I want to.
Will you, when I love you?
I'll be tied up, then.
- Untie me, I have to piss!
- Good, so do I.
Then let's go.
- No...
- Yes! - No!
Go on!
The first phrase built
on the harmony...
You have quite a chest...
Maybe.
Sorry...
Were you able to phone?
- Out of my way!
- Sorry.
No... I'm sorry.
What's the matter?
I'll explain.
I can't ask for more.
Soldier boy...
I'll look for something to eat.
He's really nuts. There's
a tape-recorder in the fridge.
I'm sorry.
It's really empty.
Who owns this place?
- Scram!
- No.
- Grab me.
- Yeah!
What do you want?
Now?
How about you?
What do I want?
In life?
To show people what
a woman does with a man.
With a man?
What she says to him?
No, not at all.
What she does to a man.
I lived here once. It belongs
to one of my uncles.
I must have been 13 or 14...
That was the living room...
This was his room.
His room...
We're going to make a movie,
some pals and I.
- Really?
- Yes... a documentary.
We're not sure yet, but...
That's why you held up a bank?
Later, later...
When my friends get here,
I'll explain.
I'll phone again tomorrow.
Then I'll explain...
There's no rush.
Move...
No. Explain it now.
What if I told you to get lost?
No.
You're attracted to me.
Yes.
Maybe...
...I am, too.
One, two...
Higher...
Enough...
Draw it out...
Vibrato...
Go ahead, stupid...
Gently... gently!
So it goes.
Why do women exist?
Ready, Claire.
Fate, show your power!
We're not our own masters.
What has been determined...
...must be.
So be it.
- Now I know...
- What?
Jail...
...why it is called "the hole"...
Why?
Why?
Everything shakes...
What did you say?
I didn't hear.
Everything shakes...
The earth...
The house...
Me.
Maybe...
...my ass also shakes...
You already have
a woman's behind.
Check everything...
...in the evening.
And the clouds...
...the clouds...
...will they reveal...
...torrents of life?
Will you write to me,
when I'm in jail?
You won't go.
Nothing's lost.
You'll write to me?
And you?
Me...
...actually I have no
friends, male or female.
I know one girl,
but she's too special.
Loneliness forced me
to be my own best friend.
I really thought
you wouldn't untie me.
I haven't had that
kind of scare in ages.
You went to college?
Not really.
Were your parents too poor,
or didn't you want to?
They were too poor,
and I didn't want to go.
Why?
Telling you why
would take all day.
I have to figure
myself out, first.
Get it?
I get it.
Jacques only hires
college kids.
But I'II try...
But then...
you've been a cop.
How else would we have met?
That's just it...
You have a young
girl's behind...
- A woman's too.
- You know, Joe... - Joseph.
I'm warning you...
If I love you...
...that's the end of you.
Yes, Carmen.
What's it called?
What?
Something about...
...the innocent ones on one side...
...the guilty ones on the other...
And... I don't know...
Neither do I.
The dream is over!
Back to earth!
Get inside!
"The light of the just
outshines the wicked."
Proverbs 13-6.
"The Police is to society,
what dreams are to the individual!"
- Move, in jail!
- You are hamming it up now!
We've waited long enough.
He was paid to protect
people's money.
He didn't do his job.
He must pay his debt to society.
Society?
You mean Big Business!
Establishment funds!
Their money!
Tell the truth, shit!
Silence her, your honor!
I won't be quiet!
He did right.
Youth always chooses
love over money.
Silence her!
Let the prosecution speak.
- "And good man obtains
the Lord's favor..." - Such daring...
- Let the prosecution speak!
- Such love of danger...
...can be seen in a look...
...in a walk, a smile...
- It's in all of us...
- Let the prosecution speak!
Such violence is
a kind of peace...
OK, I'll tell you... we're
going to kidnap a guy.
- Kidnap?
- Yes, a wealthy businessman.
On Fridays and Saturdays
he gambles here at the Casino.
It's either him,
or his daughter.
Why not both?
There aren't enough of us.
We're only 4 people.
- Anyway it's not up to me.
- Let the prosecution speak.
"The sinner falls into
a deadly trap,
the righteous eschew it. "
Joseph Bonnaff√©'s features
are fine,
but extremely provocative...
His fine features...
provoke.
"A fool strikes out,
the wise hark advice."
Proverbs 11-17.
"A fool's wrath is soon known,
- the wise endure insults".
- Proverbs 13-17!
Is he in the film business?
No... the movie was my idea.
I said let's do like "Dillinger".
I read it in a comic strip...
He held up a bank,
pretending
to be making a movie...
So... with this
video craze nowadays...
...that seemed to be
the thing to do.
Then I thought of my uncle.
He's a famous film director.
He's all washed up now,
he's sick...
I don't know what's
wrong with him.
I visited him at the hospital.
I said we'd finance
a movie for him.
He was in love with me
when I was a kid...
At least...
I think...
I was his favourite relative.
He wanted me to be in his films.
But I didn't want to.
Lunch time.
Lunch recess!
You can't free that bum?
If the bail's high enough...
You judges are a drag!
We bust our asses
to find the guilty ones...
Where are you?
To be or not to be...
That's not really a question.
Does that woman really
matter to you?
Something really strange...
almost taboo...
A force propels me
towards her...
Like the tide rushing in...
It also goes out.
I'll help you.
Will you let me?
He will.
You can stay with
us a few days.
Tell him, Dad.
I got you a job
with the railroad.
OK, back to work!
Will you let me?
I think it'll work...
I forgot... someone
gave this for you.
A whisky.
You forgot your gun.
You need us.
Screw you!
No news?
Nothing.
Delighted, Mr. Godard.
Scene 17, take 6.
Mao said: "Always keep
figures in your head".
Mao's been forgotten these days.
Yet he was a great cook.
- Yes, yes...
- He fed all of China.
We must talk business.
Where's Carmen?
She's not coming. She's
not reliable these days...
Sure... she's in love.
- Precisely.
- In love...
- I don't know with whom.
- In love...
Want some brioches?
Thanks.
Some brioches for my friend.
Kids today are scum!
They haven't invented cigarettes
or blue-jeans. Nothing!
They invented unemployment.
Not really. They didn't
go looking for it.
- One has to...
- One has to look.
Van Gogh looked for some
yellow at sunset.
You have to look, friend,
you have to look.
We must talk business.
Come over here.
You have to look.
I look forward to making
another movie in a casino.
I'll get...
- I'll get a madeleine out of it.
- Really?
3 years ago...
I directed Marlene Dietrich and
Ludwig Beethoven in Nice.
I was a producer then,
my partner was
Robert Dorfman.
We had no money to pay the
crew. So we gambled with...
the technicians' and
actors' pay. We lost it.
I was expelled from
the movie business...
...from cinema.
But I'll get even.
That's why I accepted
my niece's project.
That's what I came
to tell you...
...it's going to be shot
at a Paris hotel now.
- Not at the beach.
- Even better!
May I ask you a real question?
Go ahead.
It's not a true story?
What do you mean?
I hope your documentary
is fiction.
- Of course it is.
- That's good.
What about money?
How much do you want?
1,327,000... centimes...
OK, I'll write you a check.
That's settled.
Carmen and I will call you.
Wait, the dialogue
is not over...
Will there be a wardrobe lady?
I tore my...
...my coat coming
out of the subway.
Don't worry...
We're real pros.
I must be off.
Need a cab?
Call you next week.
What is... the nature of...
...the current crisis?
Our fucked up economies
that produce...
...waste.
The goal of classic
capitalism was...
...to produce the
best goods possible.
In today's world one
can't make profits...
...because machines
are all powerful.
The machines have
started to produce...
...goods nobody needs...
...from atom bombs
to plastic cups.
No one needs an atom bomb...
or a plastic cup.
- Where were you?
- Never mind.
Suit yourself.
I'm looking at you.
Look at me.
I saw your uncle.
Red wine, please.
I still think it's
a lousy idea.
And should it be the
father or the daughter?
You still don't know?
Don't listen to him.
He's so negative.
Did you see the lawyer
about the checks?
He says not to write
bum checks...
But to write good checks
on a bum bank.
It's too much for me tonight.
I'm going to bed.
Coming?
I don't know...
- Good morning and good night.
- Good night.
- Where did you get that dress?
- You coming?
Listen to me...
- Let me make up my own mind.
- Yes...
See you tomorrow.
Yes?
It's all set.
See you later...
It's all set.
What exactly will
I have to do?
I'll tell you later...
They'll tell you.
I like it...
We caress projects...
...and I caress you.
Remember what I told you?
No, what?
About that American movie...
When she said: "If I love
you, that's the end of you."
- Still want to?
- Yes... yes.
Is your ass clean?
Mine is... and yours?
Mine isn't.
If I put my fingers in it...
What if you did?
We're not shit...
The world is.
- Oh, Joe...
- Joseph.
What comes before a name?
The first name.
No, I mean before
you get called...
I wouldn't know.
Sometimes I wonder...
what I'm doing with you...
It's your suit.
Put it there.
So?
What's my part?
Later... tonight...
What the hell do I
do here all day?
- What the hell...?
- I'm going out.
I'm late.
What do I do?
Tell me!
Think...
...I'm...
Think I'm pretty...
You think I'm pretty?
You know I do.
You know it...
There you are!
Think about that...
See you tonight.
If not tonight, tomorrow.
You said tonight.
I have work to do.
Work...
What about me?
And money?
Think about that too.
The deal's signed! Tomorrow we
dine with the President of France.
I love you.
Coming, darling?
That's OK.
One bed's enough.
Yes, sir.
It's OK.
I said it's OK...
You can go.
Help!
Help!
Cut it out. Hallo!
Hi, soldier boy.
Your lordship...
Where's Carmen, eh?
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la.
Asshole!
Are you through?
Carmen's there.
Not ready yet?
Get moving!
And the guns?
Under the cushions!
No one cleans there in hotels.
You've been here long?
I got in at 5.
I waited for you.
I was downstairs.
I have to go out again.
I can't help it.
We've got work to do.
OK, that's enough,
we're in a rush.
That's for the garage,
the switchboard, the kitchens.
- And the maids?
- Nothing!
Give me something to do.
Sorry, old boy...
Carmen agrees with me.
For you...
We're professionals.
Can I keep the dress?
We'll see...
Did you go to college?
Not really.
You see...
Quit jerking off in there...
- OK... Coming, Mr. Gregory!
Hurry! - Coming...
You're not coming,
you're going.
I waited 2 months,
even more...
60 days is OK,
but not 63 or 64...
Leave it there.
All right?
Yes... thank you, Miss.
You know, I was ashamed...
Scared... not ashamed.
Scared...
Are you ever scared?
Never, Miss.
- Good-bye, for now.
- Bye, Miss.
Stop pissing me off!
I'm sleepy.
Where were you?
Tomorrow.
This is tomorrow.
I'm sleepy.
I may be dumb, but
you're overdoing it!
Let go.
I want to sleep.
Alone.
We must talk.
We've said it all.
We've said nothing.
Tomorrow...
Please.
That's today.
Day after, then.
Two days from now.
Yes, Joe...
And my job?
I tried...
I'm still trying.
That's not true.
It is true!
It is true!
I'll kill you...
...if you leave.
- Forgive me, but let me sleep.
- No.
Carmen, God damn you...
That should come first...
- Ignore him.
- God's name...
Ignore him.
God, if Van Gogh
had seen that yellow!
- Yes...
- Do I write that?
We'll meet downstairs
at 3 o'clock.
- Come on, Uncle Jean.
- Goodbye, madam.
Why the quartet?
I'll tell you later.
Don't worry, we're pros.
I'm sorry, but...
What's got into you?
You're through...
She'll tell you...
No! The brioches!
- Carmen...
- I'll get dressed.
- Listen.
- No, it's curtains!
It's over.
That's not you speaking.
I'm joining the others.
- You'll be OK?
- Yes, yes...
The sound of the
sea was missing.
Go away.
You won't leave...
...so Carmen's leaving.
Bring my coffee next door.
Yes, Miss.
Come with me.
You may take off your jacket.
And your pants, too.
You disgust me.
Me, too.
I never get over things...
...anything.
Why do men exist?
Here are the musicians.
Oh, it's you.
You know we don't
play pop music.
Yes, times are hard-boiled
for eggs like us.
Do I write that?
Here they are...
A white and two blacks,
so it's catchy.
Do I write that?
We're no amateurs.
He wants his check.
I know.
When the job's done!
It's a documentary
on luxury hotels.
Mind if we film you?
We're leaving in 15 minutes.
It's no good.
It's too sad.
It has to be sad.
- In 15 minutes.
- Yes, but it's almost dawn.
Anyway, it is sad.
What is it?
- 15 minutes.
- Shit!
All these women are so beautiful!
Beauty...
...is only the start of
bearable terror.
Do I write that?
I do what I want!
Want a job?
Go jump in the lake!
Hello, Miss.
What are you doing here?
I came to see someone.
That woman!
If I go to the moon, to get
financing, will you write to me?
Yes.
You took a long time
to count to 33!
Maybe.
I won't work under
these conditions.
I'll go say good-bye.
The perfect blending of
several voices hinders their...
...individual progress.
I'm writing that down.
You and your lousy ideas...
I should've left you in
that dime story, Carmen!
- Carmen...
- Not him again?
Get rid of him!
They're leaving.
We screwed up again!
Not yet.
No, Uncle Jean!
- Showtime.
- Go away!
Cool it, Mr. Godard.
Deal with the girl... Not
the camera, idiots! The guns!
Christine, in God's name!
Freeze!
Hurry!
I asked you what you
were doing here!
First I'll kill her,
then myself.
Kill her first...
...then I'll kill you.
OK kids, hold it!
Stay where you are!.
- Stop!
- Help!
What are you doing?
The guns!
I didn't do anything!
Thank you!
Cool it, lady. Take care
of this. I have work to do.
Obey, you fool!
I'm the fool.
Let go of her.
It's all over.
Which one will fire?
Lovers are often cowards.
Let's go.
Have the bodies removed.
My job's with the living.
Come on, stop pretending!
Go on ahead.
Is something wrong, Miss?
Miss.
What's it called...
on one side, the innocent...
...the guilty on the other?
I don't know, Miss.
Think, stupid!
I don't know, Miss.
When everything's been
lost but a daybreak...
...and yet we're
still breathing?
It's called sunrise, Miss.
