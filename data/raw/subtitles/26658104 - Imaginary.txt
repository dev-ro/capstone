My grandma, who I moved in

she used to always say
that I turned every wall

That must have started here.
Your grandma sounded nice.
My mom is too

I wanted this house

(GASPS)
What are you doing?
(SIGHS)
I've had a really long day.
I come home and find your son
giving Molly to my 15-year-old.
I'm sorry, this isn't Molly.
This is my allergy medicine.
Get back to the
house, you idiot.
(SOFTLY) Psycho.
(EERIE MUSIC BUILDS)
- Now!
- (GASPS)
JESSICA: What are you gonna do?
LIAM'S MOM: (SIGHS)
I'm so sorry.
Taylor, I am really
trying to trust you.
Just no more guests without
my permission, ever.
I already said I'm sorry.
How many more times do
you wanna hear me say it?
I swear that that was not me.
- (SIGHS)
- But I don't know why Liam
- would've destroyed your...
- I don't think it was Liam.
Or you.
Hey, kiddo. (SIGHS)
I know you're not
really sleeping.
I'm sorry I wasn't here earlier.
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
(CELL PHONE CAMERA CLICKING)
Alice?
Come on, sweetie.
I get it.
What happened,
that should never have happened.
And I know you're angry with me.
I get angry too sometimes
and rip up my own paintings
when I wanna feel something big.
When I need to
feel something new.
But it's never okay to rip
up someone else's stuff.
(BED CREAKING)
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)
When I was little,
after my mom died,
my dad, uh
they said his brain got sick,
and he stopped
acting like himself.
And one terrible night,
he got really angry.
And they made me
leave this house.
Leave the happiest
place I ever knew.
And you should never
have to say goodbye
to the things you love.
So, I just need you to know
that none of this
is your fault, okay?
None of it.
You deserve to feel
safe and loved.
And I thought because of
what was taken from me,
that I could never
be a good mom.
But then I met you,
and your sister,
and, ooh, honey, the
way I love you both
made me think that
maybe I could...

(ALICE SOBBING)
JESSICA: No, Max.
I'm telling you it
wasn't an accident.
Baby, I'm scared.
I have never seen
Alice like this before.
And Taylor, God,
(SOFTLY) I don't even
know where to start.
I'm sorry. I thought
I could do this.
I really did.
I just wanted to give 'em
a safe place, you know?
To be a good mom.
Passable mom, at
least. I don't know.
- Maybe I'm not able to...
- (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)

(EERIE MUSIC SWELLS)
(MUSIC FADES OUT)
JESSICA: Dr. Soto,
please come in.
DR. SOTO: I'm happy to be here.
I'm looking forward to
reconnecting with Alice.
JESSICA: Well,
that's good to hear.
This has been a...
- It's been a lot.
- I understand.
There are so many things
outside of Alice's
control right now.
Creating an imaginary friend,
or what we call a paracosm
is her way of finding stability.
I should've put my
foot down earlier.
Not encouraged her
relationship with Chauncey.
You made the right decision.
It's important to
honor Alice's truth
because if we don't,
we might not get to
the bottom of this.
- Where shall I set up?
- Oh.
Please, right here.
I'll be ready for Alice soon.
(CAMCORDER BEEPS)
DR. SOTO: So good to
see you again, Alice.
Jessica told me you've
been spending time
with a new friend.
Can Chauncey be here with us?
Of course.
Where would you like
Chauncey to sit?
So, why don't you tell
me about Chauncey?
He loves me a lot.
- He's always hungry.
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
My favorite thing is his eyes.
I can see anything I
can imagine in them.
DR. SOTO: Mm.
But then he asked
you to do something.
Something that hurt you, right?
Chauncey said it was
part of the game.
That's right. The
scavenger hunt.
But does that seem like a game
a good friend
would want to play?
Chauncey doesn't want
me to talk about that.
Nobody else was supposed
to see the list but us.
I understand.
Maybe you should tell
Chauncey how he made you feel.
Go ahead, Alice.
(INHALES)
(EXHALES)
Chauncey...
That really scared me.
I didn't wanna hurt my hand.
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY)
Just for fun.
ALICE: But I told you
it made me scared.
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY)
Chauncey need Alice be brave.
Chauncey keep Alice safe.
I just wanna go
back to having fun.
Like we did before.
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY)
No, no go back.
New things to see.
Never-Ever. Never-Ever.
Let's pause there, Alice.
You said that you loved me.
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY)
Nobody love Alice.
ALICE: (SOBBING) That's mean.
Chauncey not mean.
Fake mommy mean.
Fake mommy will leave.
You're lying!
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY)
Fake mommy always leave.
Only Chauncey love
Alice. Always.
Okay, let's explore
these thoughts, Alice.
Why do you think
Jessica wants to leave?
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY)
Fake mommy bad,
fake mommy cruel,
fake mommy hurt true friends.
That's not true. Don't say that!
Let's talk about this anger
you're feeling towards Jessica.
Maybe we shouldn't play
together anymore, Chauncey.
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY) No.
Maybe we shouldn't be friends!
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY,
SHOUTING) No, no, no, no, no!
Let's take a time-out, Alice.
- Now.
- (SOBBING)
ALICE: (AS CHAUNCEY)
Stupid doctor say anything
to Alice mom, I hurt you.
And your three ugly
granddaughters.
(ALICE SOBBING)
(TENSE MUSIC SWELLS)
(MUSIC FADES OUT)
(SCREAMING) No! (SOBBING)
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)
- Uh...
- What's.
(DOOR SHUTS) I need to ask.
Has Alice taken up any
new hobbies lately?
- Ventriloquism?
- Ventriloquism?
I'm sorry, no. I don't think so.
Um...
Can we talk privately
about next steps?
Of course. Uh...
Would you check on her?
I'll be up in a minute.
(SOBBING)
Hey.
Hey.
Chauncey's mad at me.
Will you stay with me, please?
It's okay, Ali-Cat, all right?
You're just gonna get comfy.
You're gonna take
a little nap, okay?
Okay.
On our session today,
Alice brought up something new.
Something that she
called the "Never-Ever."
This reminded me of
another paracosm case.
A patient I encountered
over ten years ago.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
DR. SOTO: (OVER VIDEO) Luis.
Tell me more about Randy Rabbit.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Randy is my best friend.
He loves me.
DR. SOTO: Did he also
tell you to do that?
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
Luis?
It's okay to tell me.
LUIS: He said not to say.
That you'd never understand.
Never ever.
DR. SOTO: Luis went
missing a week after that.
The police never found
him. He vanished.
I read many cases,
missing children,
children with extreme
paracosm attachments
who caused them to detach
from their families
and leave home, just like Luis.
- (KEYBOARD CLACKS)
- He said not to say.
That you'd never understand.
Never ever.
(KEYBOARD CLACKS)
Jessica?
(SLOW EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC FADES OUT)
Did Alice draw that?
Those other kids you were
talking about before,
the ones who
disappeared, vanished,
they all had friends
they played with too?
Yes.
(EXHALES)
That's it.
I gotta destroy that bear.
What bear?
Chauncey. Alice's stuffed bear.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
The stuffed bear Alice
brought into the study?
(EXHALES) I don't understand.
(CHUCKLES) What?
What is this?
(CAMCORDER BEEPING)
Take a look for yourself.
Go ahead, Alice.
ALICE: Chauncey, that
really scared me.
Yeah, and she put it down
on the sofa there, right?
(CAMCORDER REWINDING)
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
CHAUNCEY: And your three
ugly granddaughters.
(CAMCORDER BEEPS)
(JESSICA'S BREATH TREMBLING)
What?
There was never any bear.
No, I...
Uh...
It's a donut from England.
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)

they pronounce it "scon."
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(BREATH TREMBLING)
Jessica, are you okay?
DR. SOTO: Where would
you like Chauncey to sit?
(JESSICA'S BREATH TREMBLING)
Hey, um...
You've seen the
stuffed bear, right?
Chauncey?
What? No. He's imaginary.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
That's what imaginary
friends are.
Hey! Those are for Chauncey!
I'm scared Simon is going to
try and catch Molly again.
- Can Chauncey be here with us?

Can I ask how long have
you been seeing this bear?
Um...
Since we moved back.
(DR. SOTO SIGHS)
There's been a lot of
change going on recently,
maybe an incident
from your childhood
that you're dealing with.
But that doesn't explain
why Alice is seeing it too.
Kids are very intuitive.
Far more than we think.
There are documented
cases of children
having the same
dream as a parent.
My suspicion is that whatever
is going on with you,
Alice is tuning into.
I have a colleague I
think you should talk to.
Please.
Call him.
Take care.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BUILDS)
(SCRATCHING ON FLOOR)
There you are.
I'm not supposed to talk to you.
Dr. Soto said you weren't real.

I'm sorry.

wanna be your friend.

Okay, well
the basement.
Jess, what's wrong?
(DOOR CREAKING)
What the hell is this?
We need to keep looking.
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
No one's seen her
at all tonight.
The police are looking.
We'll find her.
You keep trying to
make everything better,
but you are only
making it worse.
I mean, none of this
even makes sense.
She was sleeping in her room.
People do not just disappear.
"You disappeared."
What are you talking
about? What...
It was something that
my dad said. I...
I didn't understand
what he meant.
I thought he meant when I
moved away, but... Okay.
This is gonna sound out there,
but I think that my
childhood imaginary friend
and Alice's are the same.
And I think the way that
Alice just disappeared,
- maybe I, maybe...
- Just stop!
- Just stop, Jess!
- Listen.
- I know it sounds crazy...
- My sister is missing.
And she didn't disappear.
She ran away
because you forced
your way into our life
and screwed everything up
trying to be this perfect mommy.
Well, guess what, Jess?
You're not needed.
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
Taylor, I've been...
I'm going to walk
the block again.
Maybe I'll see something.
(SIGHS)
(SOBS, SNIFFLES)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
TAYLOR: Alice!
Alice!
Alice!
(TAYLOR GASPING)
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(GASPS)
Oh, wait. I didn't
mean to scare you.
I know that Alice is missing,
but this is about Jessica
and what happened
when she was a child.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(SLOW EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
I wanted to say something
when Jessica first
moved back here,
but it was clear
she didn't remember.
Maybe she didn't want to.
But after Alice,
after tonight...
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
GLORIA: I'm sorry
it's such a mess.
I don't entertain many guests.
But look... look at this.
Look at this.
Jessica drew that for me once.
What does this have
to do with Alice?
Well, when Jessica
was little, she would
talk about a trip
she was going to take
to a secret place.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
A place just for her and
her imaginary friend.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
Yeah, I thought it was
just kid stuff until
well, until the last
night I sat for her,
and I saw something
I couldn't explain.
Jessica opened a door.
A door that leads
to the same place
that I believe Alice went.
(SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING)
After Jessica moved away,
I became consumed
with understanding
what I'd seen.
It became my life's work.
My obsession.
You think Alice was
abducted by a spirit?
Every culture has a name for it.
Entities that
tether to the young.
The Spanish call it "El Cuco."
The Trinidadians, the "Jumbie."
We call them imaginary friends.
You're saying Bing Bong is real?
I know that sounds odd.
People don't believe
in otherworldly things.
Until they must.
Kids, on the other hand,
all have imaginary friends.
Most of them are benevolent.
Helpful even.
Benign projections
from an entity
in the spirit world.
And the connection with
the child almost always
fades naturally over time.
But sometimes when
the child is separated
from her imaginary friend,
in an unnatural or sudden way,
the trauma can cause the entity
to hunger for the
child's imagination.
Friendship isn't ever one way.
Imaginary friends thrive
off of a child's
creativity and imagination.
It feeds that hunger.
Jessica's creativity
was especially
vibrant and powerful.
When their connection
was severed,
her friend's hunger
turned violent.
So, Bing Bong is bad,
and he has Alice?
The friend that Jessica
was separated from
didn't just disappear.
He waited in that house.
And his name is not Bing Bong.
It's Chauncey.
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
Isn't it?
(SIGHS)
- (CLATTERING IN DISTANCE)
- (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
- (EERIE CHORD PLAYS)
- (BOTH GASP)
Taylor, please, you
have to believe me.
What happened to Alice
happened to me too.
Actually, I know it did.
(GLORIA SIGHS)
JESSICA: My dad
kept repeating it.
"CB, talking with that CB."
I thought he was delusional.
You know, ranting about
some radio I had as a kid,
but he was saying the
name of my friend.
Seebee.
It was my childish way of
saying Chauncey's full name.
You know, the name I gave him.
Chauncey Bear.
You told me all about CB.
And you showed me the list
that you made together.
I thought it was make-believe
until you went away.
To the Never-Ever.
I think that the entity
who was projecting
the teddy bear image,
when he realized that
he was gonna lose you,
he tried to bring you
back to his realm,
where he could keep you forever.
How could you forget all that?
Because I was five?
Because I'd just lost
my mother to cancer.
Now this thing took Alice
because I abandoned him.
So, how did you get back
here from that place?
How do we get Alice back?
I think my list is the key.
TAYLOR: I can only
read half of that.
Those are so faded.
They're the same.
(EERIE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)
We're seriously doing
a kid's scavenger hunt
to open a doorway to a
magical spirit world?
- My sister is missing.
- Taylor.
It's not about the actual
items, it's a benediction.
It's about how far
you're willing to go
to prove your devotion.
A paintbrush,
something that burns.
Okay.
There was more to Alice's list.
Back side.
It was something
that makes you mad,
that makes you cry.
I got the mad part and the
crying part all in one.
The last few items were
something that scares you,
something that you'll
get in trouble for,
and something that
makes you hurt.
Want me to send a bitchy text?
It needs to hurt. Really hurt.
You cut your arm.
And Dr. Soto's former
patient cut off his thumb.
Alice tried to impale
herself with that rusty nail.
GLORIA: That night
when you went in,
you begged me to come with you,
(SIGHS) and I wanted
to, I wish I had,
but I was scared.
I'm...
I'm so sorry that I
let you go in alone.
I should have been braver.
Jessica,
he opened the door
for you once before.
I'm sure he'll do it again.
Something that hurts.
(JESSICA EXHALES)
There's a first aid
kit up in the hallway.
I need you to go and get it.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
Remember what you felt like
when you were that kid,
that creative kid.
You were lonely and scared
and missing your

and wanting a new friend

that your father
couldn't help you with.
Take you away to

(DISEMBODIED VOICES)
I have to fix it. I do.
Why do I always have

Jess, I was...
You're the reason
Alice is missing.
You were supposed
to be watching her.
- Stop, I...
- She's your sister.
She needed you, but
you're so self-absorbed,
you couldn't be
bothered to notice.
You're selfish, Taylor.

He wasn't strong enough.
It destroyed him.
It caused a cognitive

He went in to rescue me.

No. Oh, my God.

It wants us here. All of us.
I watched you go in
all those years ago
while I was left behind, alone,
abandoned by you,
abandoned by him.
And now, none of us
will be left alone.
This is what the
entity promised me.
A place where you
leave pain behind,
and where you leave
where you leave
suffering behind,
and it's a place of joy,
of endless possibilities.
Jessica, you didn't come back

TAYLOR: This is what it
looked like years ago.
Before I moved in.
I'm going to check her room.
(SLOW EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
(GRUNTS)
Alice! Hey.
JESSICA: Baby, it's
time to go. Okay?
But I have everything
I want here.
I have my new room
in my old apartment,
lots of presents,
(EXCITEDLY) and a puppy!
And now you're all here.
My sister and both my moms.
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
(JESSICA GASPS)
Keep away from her.
You don't have to
feel threatened.
You can all stay.
Alice?
Sweetie, she's not real,
okay? She's imaginary.
Oh, but you should honor
Alice's feelings, Jessica.
I can help you become
the perfect mom
to these two perfect girls.
Alice, Taylor, it's time to go.
How? The blue door is closed.
SAMANTHA: Don't fight it.
Stay.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
ALICE: Hey!
You're breaking them!
I told you she'd
try and spoil it.
Jess, what are you doing?
Imagination has power here.
But we can use it to
make something new.
Sometimes we create
by tearing things
apart. (GRUNTS)
Don't mind them, sweetie.
- She's being bad.
- Mm-hmm.
We love those books.
You should never
have to say goodbye
to the things you love.
JESSICA: Come on, Alice.
It's fun.
See?

Alice? Sweetie?
It's working.

JESSICA: "That was the
end of the old story
"and the beginning of a new one.
"So what happens when a spider
finally catches a millipede?
"Maybe not what you think.
"Simon had been chasing
Molly for so long
"that he'd grown old."
"He had no breath left
in his lungs to speak."
"So instead, he wrapped her up
"in his eight arms
and hugged her."
"Which is a spider's
way of saying,"
"'I've loved you all along.'"
I know what you did for me, Dad.
(SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
How hard it must've
been all these years.
(TEARFULLY) I'm sorry you
went through that alone.
I never really said
thank you, Jess.
I know I could be
hard to deal with.
(LAUGHS)
But you never gave up on me.
ALICE: And you showed me
I didn't need Chauncey.
I'm strong on my own.
Thanks...
Mom.
(SLOW EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
I'm still here.
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
(DISTORTED) You said
you'd never leave him.
(POWER SHUTS OFF)
(DOOR CREAKING)
MAX: (DISTORTED) You lied.
Did you really think
he'd let you go
again?
(SOBBING)
Alice was just the bait.
BEN: (DISTORTED) That's
why he waited for you.
Your imagination
was too strong.
(JESSICA GASPS)
It fed him.
And now you will never leave.
(DISTORTED) If you do,
he'll come back for Taylor,
for Alice.
(DISTORTED) If you love them,
his is how you save them.
You could be happy here.
(SNIFFLES)
Okay.
Okay.
I'll stay.
Just leave them
alone. (SNIFFLES)
Let them live.
CHAUNCEY: (DISTORTED)
You're mine, finally.
