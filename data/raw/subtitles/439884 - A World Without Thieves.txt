Day Day
Have a good day.
Have a good day.
Should Shit
Not "shit." That's a dirty word.
Should
Should
You should be sorry to me.
You should...
What-what "to me?"
You You
Should Should
Be Be
Sorry Sorry
To me
Oh, that "to me."
It means:
You should apologize to me.
I need to learn that one.
I keep getting screwed lately.
But only sorry is not enough.
But only sorry... not enough.
Take your pills.
Not now.
If you don't take them now, you'll forget.
I guarantee you...
he won't last long.
What's your name again?
Wang Li. Miss Wang.
You didn't even read the company reports.
Lan-lan!
Look after Uncle for me.
Only three cigarettes a day.
Call me if he misbehaves.
You really are something.
Do whatever you feel like.
All that work at the office
but you waste time studying this stuff.
I need it for business.
Lots of foreign clients.
Have a good day!
Lan-lan.
Come!
Come.
I hear your cousin is in town?
Why not pay him a visit?
Take the afternoon off.
Here's a hundred. Take a taxi there and back.
Don't tell Auntie I gave it to you.
Go.
Enough?
No, no. It's English:
Come is "come." Go is "go."
Now "go."
Thanks, Uncle.
You said you wouldn't touch me.
You're bad. I'm your tutor.
I know.
But I like you so much.
Do you say that to every woman?
Of course not.
Stop it... You're such a brute.
Take off your glasses first.
Slow down.
Not so rough.
Okay, I'll take it easy.
Don't blame me.
It's your fault for being so pretty.
What if your wife finds us?
She's not home.
Not so rough.
You don't have to worry. Take it easy.
Let's have a chat.
Don't be afraid. He doesn't have a weapon.
Just a camera.
Is it clear?
Yes, extremely clear.
General Manager Liu
by treating my girlfriend like this
you've hurt me deeply.
You hurt my heart.
I just taught you that one.
I had no idea she's your girlfriend.
I apologize to both of you.
You...should...sorry to me.
What?
I should apologize to you?
You got it wrong. You should say:
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
But only sorry...
is not enough.
Understand? Understand?
Yes. An apology alone won't do.
Right.
Then what do you want from me?
From an artistic point of view
you're right. It really has no value.
But as a documentary
in terms of clarity and content
it's more than enough to...
shock your wife's fragile nerves.
You should purchase it.
This is extortion.
Take it easy. Extortion...
Extortion...
You're correct.
It is extortion.
What the hell do you want?
I have no cash here.
C'mon... c'mon.
All he wants is that car.
The undersigned owes Mr. Wang
and Ms. Wang one million RMB.
After mutually amicable negotiations
I irrevocably agree to repay said debt...
with one BMW.
C'mon. Give us a fingerprint signature.
Press down here.
C'mon.
Come back here.
You hit him.
So out of line.
Look how red it is.
Does it hurt?
I can't go on.
This is the last time.
After we sell the car, let's call it quits.
I want a normal life.
Must be altitude sickness.
Don't tell me you really want a normal life.
I want to go in and pray.
After we fence this,
we'll have all the fun you want.
I'm not being funny.
I just want to earnestly pray for once.
Not bad, eh?
Even in a place like this?
Aren't you afraid of retribution?
You'd be better off praying to me.
I am a bodhisattva.
Watch your mouth.
You think you're a pilgrim or what?
You're just a she-wolf. And I'm a he-wolf.
Too late to change now.
Shut up.
You can't turn over a new leaf.
Not even in your next life.
I told you to shut up. Hear me?
Can you please stop talking.
Stop it.
I told you to shut up.
Stop it.
Stop the car.
Stop.
Trying to get us killed?
You've been so weird lately.
What's gotten into you?
From now on, I want nothing to do with you.
We're finished.
All right. Get out of here.
Get out? We haven't divided the money yet.
I want my share.
What share?
I risked my life for that money.
You risked your life?
If I hadn't distracted the cops...
in Changsha, where would you be now?
And the job in Yunnan...
If I hadn't traded myself for you...
Give me a break. I would have fought them.
You would have?
With your hands tied to the table?
For what son of a bitch
did I have this done to me?
You have no conscience, do you?
I knew it would come to this.
It's all about the money, right?
You're right. There's only the money.
What's there between us besides money?
I just want my share.
Don't do this.
I apologize. Fuck off.
Uncle, how old am I?
Why do you want to know?
I just do.
16 when you came here, been here 5 years...
that makes you about 21 . Why?
Nothing.
Uncle. Am I loaded?
Loaded with what?
How much money do I have?
Accountant.
What?
How much savings does Dumbo have?
Fifty or sixty thousand.
Is it fifty or sixty?
Sixty.
I'm loaded then.
So what?
I want to go home, build a house, find a wife.
Okay. I'll take you home...
to find a wife at New Year's.
What's your name?
I don't have a proper name.
Back home, they call me Dumbo.
You're not a local.
I'm from Hebei.
Came here to repair monasteries.
You must have accumulated
many spiritual merits.
I'm an orphan.
Ever since I can remember, I earned my keep
with the monastery carpenters.
It's an ancient craft in our village.
Thank you. Go on.
Take it.
I didn't give you a lift for money.
What's this?
A talisman. A lama gave it to me.
It wards off evil.
Lunch is on me. Thanks.
I withdrew it.
Dumbo.
Dumbo. Coming.
I withdrew your money for you. Have a look.
Sixty thousand. Wire it for him.
If you wire it
then 60,000 becomes 50,940.
They charge a postal fee.
600 yuan? Yes.
60,000 means 600 in postal fees?
The postal fees are high.
I could buy a donkey for that.
But save 600 and you might lose 60,000.
Better to wire it.
There are thieves everywhere. It'll get stolen.
Not just stolen, but robbed.
Can't be that many thieves.
Listen to your uncle.
Better to wire it home.
60k is lighter than a catty of pork.
I can't just carry it home?
So stubborn.
Fugui.
Yulan.
Everyone, come here.
You might never see me again.
I'm loaded. I'm going home to get married.
These past five years...
when everyone went home for New Year's
you always kept me company.
This time, I'm going home.
won't be able to see you anymore.
Take care.
You're not wearing your cap.
It looks better on you.
A few words before we leave.
After we board,
don't disturb Uncle Li. Let him rest.
And you...
Leave Uncle Li in peace.
Don't visit his compartment all the time.
He's big enough to forgive you.
But you need to shape up.
Are you listening to me?
Stop picking on me, okay?
Four Eyes always does it.
Why not criticize him?
Did I step on your toe?
You.
I've said it a hundred times:
We need teamwork.
Always seek the best in others.
The purpose of this trip...
is to train our team in a real situation...
and to test our new members.
Those deserving kudos are...
Little Leaf...
and Four Eyes.
Although new to the trade
they've not only surpassed themselves,
but even the old guard here.
Uncle Li.
No matter what happens, I'll do my very best.
In our work together, I hope you will all strive...
to keep reaching new heights.
A gold watch.
If I hadn't follow you, you'd be in trouble.
Sorry.
Didn't we split up? Why still following me?
Listen up.
There's more than just money between us.
Come, give it to me.
Would you guys shut up? It's annoying.
I didn't steal this 60k.
I worked hard for it.
Fair and square. Who'd steal it?
Which of you is a thief? Show your face.
Who's a thief?
Checking out the kid?
Nonsense.
See? No thieves.
Stop yelling.
They think it's funny.
Big Sister, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I'm going home.
Have you ever seen a thief?
I've seen a handful.
What's a thief look like? It's like this.
Don't mind him. He's joking.
Just stick close to me.
You know that girl?
She's a devout Buddhist.
He's in your hands, miss.
All right.
Do me a favor and watch his luggage for him.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Uncle, you guys go home.
When did you meet this kid?
You stay clear of him.
I should teach him a lesson.
The kid has no eyes for thieves.
That pisses me off.
Big Brother, Big Sister. There're seats here.
He's practically adopted us.
You sit next to him and I'll sit across from him.
Thanks.
C'mon, have a seat.
The seat's dirty.
This is...
What are you doing?
There's an empty seat over there.
Han. There's a seat here.
Take the window seat.
I'm very old. My legs aren't so good.
Make a space for me.
Sorry. This seat is taken.
I'll walk you out.
Grandpa, sit here.
Mind your own business.
Here, I'll help you find a spot.
There are none. I looked.
Sure there are.
Where's the seat?
You're a good actor.
Listen up. You and I are the same.
We are wolves.
That lamb belongs to me.
What? I don't understand.
Don't let it get to your head.
Your performance isn't bad. Like this.
And this.
Drag the leg a bit more.
Announcing you had money
to all those people...
probably did invite some thieves.
That old man is a thief?
Won't admit your own stupidity.
You think thieves carry signs?
You're just like the villagers.
You think people are all bad.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Harbor no malice, but don't be a fool.
Just be more careful.
Look at me.
Do I look like a thief?
You're no thief. You just look down on me.
Look at her. Look.
She seems like a thief?
What are you staring at?
You look kinder all the time.
Like a bodhisattva.
She is a good person.
If Big Sis were a thief, I'd chop my head off...
and let her sit on it.
No one's a thief to you. To you,
everyone is a bodhisattva.
That brainless head of yours
is useless anyway.
Chop it off and let me sit on it.
My home is in the mountains.
In our village,
if you found cow dung in the road...
but forgot your manure basket,
you'd get a rock...
and draw a line around it.
A few days later, it would still be there.
Seeing that line,
others would know the dung had an owner.
Out here in the highlands,
stayed behind every holiday...
to guard the worksite.
No one to talk to. Just the wolves.
They don't scare me. They never hurt me.
Now that I've left the highlands
with so many people to talk to
if wolves wouldn't hurt me
I can't believe people would.
People can't be worse than wolves.
Big Brother. Am I right?
Uncle Li. That worker's asking for it.
Let's pinch him quickly so
the brothers don't get distracted...
by the scent of fresh meat and lose their cool.
You've lost your cool.
What smells sweet to the nose...
can be poison to the mouth.
Pass this order along. Six words:
No hunting allowed on this train.
We've got a brainless lamb...
snuggled between two thieving wolves.
Uncle Li. If we don't fleece him
they'll be getting too sweet a deal.
You're obsessed with small change.
You'll never do big things.
This is between me and Uncle.
Stop babbling.
You have no sense of respect.
I tell you what, when I started out
you were just a schoolgirl.
Stop bragging.
Let's have a duel.
If I lose, I'll kiss your ass.
You're a dead woman.
You think I'm non-existent?
What's the point of showing off to your brother?
No respect for your elders.
Number Two.
Yes.
I told you many times already...
pettiness doesn't win loyalty.
To be the boss, you must be tolerant.
I know.
Leaf. Come massage my shoulders.
I'm leaving.
I am, however, curious to see what...
those love birds are made of.
This century's most expensive commodity is...
talent.
Oops. You okay?
Be careful.
Very hot. Let me see.
It hurts.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Dumbo. Watch where you're going.
It hurts.
It's okay. Just a minute.
What you doing?
Go sit with Sister. See if you're burnt.
Dumbo is burnt. What happened?
I'm okay.
Someone bumped into me.
But you're all red.
Cop.
Coming through.
Take care of your brother. It's a long trip.
Same goes for you.
I think his eyesight is bad.
Keeps running into walls.
I know. Thanks.
Big Brother, Big Sister. Are you hungry?
I've got boiled eggs in my bag.
Did that 60k get wet?
Nope.
It's wrapped in oilpaper. It's waterproof.
Stop showing off. Put it away.
Does it hurt? Let's put some cream on it.
I'm fine.
But it's all red.
I'll do it myself.
Don't be shy.
Lift your head.
Doesn't hurt anymore?
Really?
Feel good?
I feel good just watching.
Sister has a bodhisattva's heart.
Really?
How come I never knew that?
No one cares that I was cut.
Where?
My ass.
Look.
Get out of here.
Just kidding.
Box dinners here. 10 yuan and 5 yuan.
My wallet? I lost my wallet.
Really?
When you bought water before we boarded
I remember you still had the money.
Must have been stolen.
Keep looking. Maybe you dropped it?
How could I have dropped it?
A thief must have nabbed it.
He's probably right here in this car.
Just your bad luck,
but a lost purse averts calamity.
Better pray I don't catch him.
He won't get off easy.
There's no shortage of thieves here.
Do your best, Sherlock.
Big Brother, Big Sister. I've got eggs here.
This way please.
Have a seat. Thanks.
Waitress. Yes.
What's the deal?
Two of our dishes haven't come yet.
I'm sorry. Let me check on it right away.
Hurry it up.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Surname Hu, given name Li. Hu Li.
As a matter of courtesy,
everybody calls me Uncle Li.
From whence does this immortal hail?
I'm not immortal.
Just a friendless ghost passing through.
Forgive me.
You see that, punk?
Uncle Li just peeled a raw egg.
I'd like us to be friends.
Join me for a chat in my compartment?
Different strokes for different folks.
Ghosts with different destinations
should take separate paths.
The kid's cash will belong to me.
I'll call you Uncle Li if you cut me some slack.
Don't worry, brother.
Uncle Li doesn't work trains.
I've already given the order:
No hunting allowed on this train.
That lamb is all yours.
I presume those two...
gentlemen are your brothers?
They're working for me.
They eat your food but don't obey your orders.
What do you mean?
While you staked out your pasture,
they were penning the lambs.
Is that so?
Evidently, the lamb escaped, and my men...
got bit by a shepherd dog.
Shepherd dog? Not at all.
Just a hungry wolf.
Any paws in my rice bowl and they get cut off.
" cast my gaze toward the moon, "
yet the moon shines on the gutter.
Organized enough, but no discipline.
Turn your face to me.
Turn around.
You think I'm not being fair?
Yes.
What did you say? I didn't hear you.
Yes.
Louder. I couldn't hear.
Yes.
Number Two
tell him the consequences for disobeying me.
Chop a finger off.
Still feel like being fresh?
Or snap your neck...
Do whatever you like to me.
My conscience is clear.
Should I apologize to you?
Uncle Li. He's new, doesn't know the rules.
Do let him off.
Admit your mistake and beg forgiveness.
So insolent.
I was just acting on Uncle's orders.
What did I do wrong?
Who gave you my orders?
Number Two said you ordered me to do it.
That's bullshit.
Say it again and I'll beat you myself.
Impudence.
Down on your knees.
Go on.
Number Two said you wanted to
test the love birds.
So I inspected the goods.
Otherwise I wouldn't...
Big Brother. It's your turn.
The bathroom's free.
Big Brother?
What's wrong?
Why are you so sad?
Say something?
What is it?
Tell me what's wrong.
I can tell you, but keep it to yourself.
She's so cheerful all the time, right?
But she doesn't know...
she doesn't have long to live.
What disease does she have?
Can it be cured?
It's terminal.
What's a "terminal?"
She's suffering...
but there's nothing we can do.
Nothing?
I'll go ask her.
That will only make her unhappy.
So what should we do?
Medical care.
But that costs a lot.
How much does it cost?
A lot.
A lot.
I'll never earn so much in my entire life.
Your big brother is useless.
I wish I could sell myself.
Listen to me:
You can't let her know.
Promise me.
We have to keep her happy
for however long she has left.
Where'd you go?
He was telling me his village tales.
Dumbo. What did he say to you?
Look at me.
Nothing.
Big Sister.
Want to hear a joke from our village?
Okay.
I forgot it.
How about... I sing a village song for you?
A child left home to wander the world
with no good clothes nor good cigarettes.
At last he got a job and worked his head off.
Tears streamed in his heart.
Sweat on his face.
The moon was round and round.
Another year had come around.
The wandering child could not fall asleep.
He longed for his parents faraway.
Why'd you stop?
Don't wanna sing anymore.
You sing much better.
Such sweet words.
Who says he's dumb?
Big Brother. Come with me.
Big Brother. Take this 5,000 yuan...
for Big Sister's treatment.
What are you doing?
What about your wife?
I did the math: 30k for the house
two farm animals with a cart is 1 0k.
Another ten for gifts. That leaves 1 0k.
The wedding party, a TV...
two pillows and a blanket.
But you'll have nothing left.
I thought it over. I'll buy the TV later.
I appreciate your intentions...
but I can't take your money.
Don't say anymore.
Big Sister and I were fated to meet.
No.
You must take this 5,000.
I know it's not much.
What the hell did you do? He was fine just now.
I didn't steal it.
Your idiot brother insisted I take it.
He forced me to.
What did you say to him?
I didn't say anything.
Just that you were terminally ill.
You're evil.
I didn't steal it from him.
Truth be told, I wanted to see...
if he is a real moron or just pretending.
Apparently he's a real moron.
I'll tell you the truth too:
I liked Dumbo...
from the moment I saw him.
He's very innocent.
And another thing:
I'm adopting him as my brother. It's fate.
Anyone who touches him,
does it over my dead body.
You only prayed to Buddha once.
Don't get fanatical.
I'm adopting you as my brother. Okay?
He said I couldn't tell you...
that you had "terminal."
He was joking.
He loves to play pranks.
I'm perfectly healthy.
But...
I appreciate your kindness. Put it away.
But Big Brother was crying.
Why would he lie to me?
You're too honest.
No wonder you're called Dumbo.
He knows I like you.
He wanted too see if you like me too.
I do.
Then, I'm adopting you as my little brother.
When you get married I'll be
in the groom's party.
Do it.
I've lost the will of the people.
The team will be hard to lead.
That's because you're too soft.
This isn't like you.
Cutting his finger off would be easy.
But once you lose the will of the people,
you're a lone king in an empty castle.
That kid is the cause of all the trouble.
No wonder the boys are so antsy.
Truly it'd be unprofessional not to poach him.
I think... you should do the job.
And give Mr. Wang...
a lesson while you're at it.
A good general is worth a thousand troops.
"He who knows me understands my worry. "
He who knows me not finds me a mystery.
It's on fire.
Fire...
Get a fire extinguisher.
Dumbo, stay put.
You stay there no matter what.
Dumbo, where you going?
Dumbo.
I told you to stay put.
But there was a fire.
What if you got burned?
What about everyone else?
Out of the way. Coming through.
Police. Out of the way.
Out of the way. Coming through.
Out of the way.
It's out already.
It never caught fire. Just burned a small hole.
It didn't ignite. Just made a lot of smoke.
Stay here and watch your bag.
'm going to find your brother.
Were you smoking?
What are you doing?
Sorry. That hurts.
Watch it.
I'm talking to you. Sorry isn't good enough.
Why'd you pull me?
Hey, what's with you?
You sure got pregnant fast. What are you?
None of your damn business.
Let's check if the baby looks like me.
If it looks like you, it'd better not be born.
Such a slim waist.
How comfortable!
Why rob other things
when you can steal hearts?
This isn't your home. Control yourselves.
Getting hooked?
The money's yours to keep, but you...
will belong to me.
Just because of this?
Don't be ungracious.
You really think I like you?
I tell you what. It's Uncle Li who likes you.
What are you doing here? And you?
We're in trouble. What trouble?
Tell you later. Did you see a pregnant woman?
Yes.
She took Dumbo's money.
You must help me.
And you call yourself a thief?
After all this time, that money's gone by now.
And you're still chasing?
Don't go back.
Let's get off at the next stop.
It was the first time
've wanted to do a good deed.
C'mon, it's the intention that counts.
Having his money stolen was a good deed.
He ought to learn a lesson.
Anyhow, we didn't steal it.
We're just not as smart as we used to be.
Uncle Li. The birds are taking flight.
The meat? They ate it.
The lamb? Still on the train.
Follow them.
Let's go.
We're just going to leave him?
Maybe we should bring him with us.
No need. We just need his money.
You have it?
No, you do.
You stole his money.
No I didn't.
She stole his money and I stole hers.
Then I should thank you for him.
If you dare return it,
don't blame me for getting hostile.
Taking that money is like killing him.
On the contrary. I'm giving him a new life.
In all our years together
Dumbo is the only person we've met...
who trusts people and has no defenses.
Then he needs a lesson.
What makes him think he can trust everyone?
What makes him immune to suffering? What?
Because he's pure?
He's dumb.
Why you want him dumb forever?
Life demands that he wises up.
As a human being
to hide the truth about life from him...
that's deceiving him.
You know what's evil?
Deception is evil.
You're full of shit.
Why?
Listen up: Even if you return the money
he'll never get it home.
Let's do this: You return it to him.
I'll give you 60k from the bank card.
That's a fair trade, isn't it?
Who do you think you are?
You dare to bargain with me?
Are you out of your mind?
I can't take this anymore.
You really think you're a bodhisattva?
You're a thief.
1 0,000 good deeds won't change that.
You can't reverse the verdict of your life.
Are you done?
No, I'm not.
The verdict is already in
and in the next life too.
Take it all. Our accounts are clear.
Why?
Why? Why are you doing this?
Why?
Tell me.
Because I have your child in my belly.
I want to improve its karma.
Is that all right?
Hey, there you are.
Get lost.
You've had a fight.
Your little brother got off too.
He's waiting for you over there.
You kept this from me.
You don't think I'm fit to be a father.
You're not. Neither am .
But I am still having this child.
He won't be a thief.
You can't leave.
Why aren't you sleeping?
That painter brother woke me up.
He said you were down here.
Said I should get some air too.
Can you give me an egg? I wanna eat too.
Why'd you throw it away?
I'll show you a magic trick.
The egg is now in your pocket.
No, it's not. You're lying.
Then it's in my pocket. Look.
But I saw you throw it really far.
How did it get there?
That's nothing. I'll show you another one.
What?
I'll move the things from your bag into mine.
No way.
No?
See if anything's missing.
Sister, my money's gone.
It's gone.
Is there something new in your bag?
Those are my tissues.
And your money is in my bag. Look for yourself.
Is it there?
Nope.
No?
Yes. I tricked you. How did you do it?
Just a little magic trick.
The train ride's too boring.
All aboard.
All aboard.
Let's go. Get aboard.
Uncle, you missed it.
My sister did a magic trick.
Lots of people do magic tricks.
Sometimes, things made
to disappear come back to you.
And sometimes they don't.
All aboard.
What does this talisman do?
Are you troubled?
Yes.
The lama in the monastery said...
troubled people have demons in their heart.
The talisman subdues the demons.
Gets rid of your troubles,
and puts your heart at ease.
You believe in demons?
Yes.
Then wear it.
Are you troubled?
Nope. I don't believe in demons.
Such a cruel heart.
Taking off without saying goodbye?
I have no heart.
No one wants your heart.
I want your life.
You forgot...
I'm just a ghost passing by.
lost my life long ago.
And you're taking my life away...
I'm in a bad mood, so don't piss me off.
Spooking the police won't help either of us.
Anti-pickpocket division.
If you don't mind,
access the database of the wanted.
Take a look and see
if they are on any wanted lists.
It will take time.
've got hundreds of files in here.
I'll have to check one at a time.
We've got two groups of pickpockets.
need to find out exactly who they are.
Just tell us when to make our move.
No rush.
We'll wait until they all reveal themselves.
I need to sleep awhile.
Give me your bag as a pillow.
What the hell.
You again? Haven't had enough?
Just one competition left.
What?
Guts.
You got any?
Do you?
There's a tunnel up ahead.
Let's see who has guts.
Stand next to me and hold my hand.
Whoever ducks first loses.
I'm giving this opportunity to you. You go.
Leaf lost to him.
If you win, Uncle Li will think highly of you.
Go.
We have a saying in the trade
I don't tread on wind if you don't have wings.
Stop flailing. You're fine.
Either drop me or save me
but cut the bullshit.
A smart ass even in the face of death.
Your men don't keep their word.
They're bad losers.
I'm no Jackie Chan.
don't have a hundred lives.
But if I die, I'll do it without shame.
Uncle Li. Kill him.
He's too reckless.
He doesn't even respect you.
Uncle Li. He dares to insult you.
We'll lose face if word of this gets out.
Finish him off.
I'll take care of the girl myself.
Shut up. No. Don't.
Murder is for robbers.
Killing a man for losing?
Now, that would be a real loss of face.
Thanks. Wait.
I saved you because you have talent.
But my patience has limits.
Let's decide this with a final tete-a-tete.
Go on.
As we say in the trade,
"a thief loses in the blink of an eye."
You guard the kid, I'll get his money.
If I fail, I'll leave the train.
If I succeed
the money's still yours, but you belong to me.
Fair enough?
It's a deal.
See you inside.
Uncle Li.
You taught me another lesson today.
Enough.
We'll have a meeting when we get off the train.
Four Eyes.
Come here.
I have nothing against you...
just very high expectations.
You must understand the difficulty of my job.
There are prizes and penalties.
Let me give you a little keepsake.
Got yourself into trouble again?
Yeah.
I wagered myself. One round, winner takes all.
It's the only way to get these dogs off our heels.
It's my fault for getting us into this.
Being a nice person is no picnic.
No good deed goes unpunished.
I'll finish what I started.
If things get out of hand, I'll alert the cops.
You stay out of this.
This is no longer your business.
I won't take this lying down.
I have to win this round.
Attention, please.
A passenger is seriously ill
and requires a blood transfusion.
We'd like all passengers to manifest
the humanitarian spirit of revolution...
by donating blood in the steward's car.
Attention, please.
A passenger is seriously ill
and requires a blood transfusion.
How much blood will they take?
A cup.
How much blood in my body?
A basin's worth.
I can donate a cup then.
Big Brother. You've changed.
I'm a new person.
Others have already volunteered.
It will make you dizzy.
I'm not afraid.
The monks said: "Better to save a life...
than build a seven-story pagoda."
You understand, it's just a donation.
They don't pay you.
I know that.
That's why they call it a donation.
Big Brother, will you donate?
Big Brother, give a cup too.
Okay. I'll listen to you.
C'mon.
Go with Big Brother.
Afterwards,
we'll have a big meal in the dining car.
Let's go.
Don't worry.
Dumbo. I'm not going.
Why not?
Blood scares me.
Then stop following me.
Go keep Sister company.
The old guy with the luggage was a plant.
They switched the bag. It's all fake money.
Not bad.
Switched a prince for a pauper.
I challenged you only because I respect you.
But you didn't play fair.
Stop acting, it must have been you.
I can reliably inform you that...
Uncle Li is very angry.
The consequences will be severe.
It was switched. Who could have done it?
Could have been switched long ago.
There must be another master.
We've been played.
This is a robbery.
Rr--rr-rr...
...ery.
It's a robbery.
Can't stand you armed robber types.
No artistic sense whatsoever.
You're just in time.
Officer, please plan your deployment.
Send some men to Car 6.
If anything happens,
they need to control the scene.
Be careful, don't alert the couple.
Are they wanted?
Looks like it.
The arrest warrant doesn't have their photos.
Just a police sketch
based on a victim's description.
The man is Wang Bo, the woman Wang Li.
Everyone sit down.
You know what this is?
An axe.
Your w-w-waist.
What are you hiding there?
Nothing.
Feel for yourself.
You'll let me feel you?
Feel something?
What is it?
What?
Tell me if you feel anything.
G-g...Gun.
Freeze. Police.
Don't move.
Stay there. Put your weapons down.
Surprised? Never expected it was me.
Get up.
Stand up.
I'm a good guy.
On your feet.
Stand up.
I'm no robber.
I've got other business with you.
And you. Get up.
Cuff me. I've been arrested.
You think our charade...
will actually fool the police?
Best I could do under present circumstances.
We can't wait until the next station.
Number Two and Four Eyes will rat us out.
Number Two knows I'm wanted for murder.
If he sells me out, he can plea bargain.
You're not afraid I'll rat you out?
What do we do now?
Wait.
We'll be at the next station soon.
Once it stops,
the waiting cops will board the train.
Police, railway police, undercover agents.
They won't necessarily know each other.
You take me off during the confusion.
We're all clear about the particulars
of the robbery.
We'll need your signature.
Why are you carrying so much funeral money?
Bought it on the road.
For what? Bribes.
To bribe whom?
Little ghosts along the way. Sign here.
Aren't you a bit young to believe in that stuff?
Two ways of looking at it:
If death really is the final curtain,
then this is just waste paper.
But if we go to another world
ghosts there will like money too.
How does that saying go?
Even ghosts will work for money.
Right?
It's not healthy to walk around
with ghosts on your mind.
You're right. I plan on throwing this away.
Was the kid who donated blood
seated together with you?
Yes.
He fainted.
But he's fine now.
The doctor gave him sedatives.
Where is he?
Soft sleeper.
I wish he could sleep like this forever
and never wake up.
That's easy.
Have the doctor increase the dosage.
He'll never wake up again.
That way, he'd never lose his faith in this world.
He could live forever in his dream
of a world without thieves.
It's okay now.
Stop thinking crazy thoughts.
We have to get off this train.
Let me properly introduce myself. I'm a cop.
No need to introduce yourselves.
We're all clear about who's who.
He's the one who switched it.
I should return this lost property.
Take a seat.
Let's cut to the chase:
need your help in clarifying...
a few matters I don't understand.
You're thieves. Why protect the kid?
Was it just his honesty and kindness...
that softened you up?
In that case, you could have just left him alone.
Why incur the wrath of those gangsters?
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Tell me. What were you thinking?
What can we say?
We lost our heads.
I'm pregnant, so I feared retribution.
I did a good deed as penance. That's the truth.
Sounds reasonable.
I'll provide a full and fair account
of that in my report.
It's my duty to arrest you
and bring you to justice.
And that's absolutely what I'm going to do.
But to tell you the truth
what you've done...
has won my respect. Really.
I could have arrested you long ago.
Your extortion of the BMW
was a very serious offense.
But I wanted to see how your drama
would play out.
Protecting Dumbo was an act of kindness,
wanted to help you with.
I just want to know
when you switched the money.
During the fire.
All that work for a measly 60,000 yuan.
Almost lost my life for it.
We're as stupid as they get.
Do us a favor.
The money's been returned.
Promise you won't let him know
he's surrounded by thieves.
All right. I promise you.
I retrieved my wallet myself.
I won't mention in my report that you stole it.
You went through our bags?
We are searching for evidence.
I'll need to borrow this photo.
Keep it. As a memento.
We won't have many chances to meet again.
And neither will you two.
We'll be at the next station soon.
Say what you've got to say to each other.
I'll give you some time.
We're interrogating the others now.
We've notified the next station.
We'll transfer them off the train once we get in.
You showed your cards to those love birds?
If they didn't have records,
'd really like to let them go.
Number Two and the guys really sold you out.
How do you feel?
God helps those who help themselves.
No loyalty at all.
Loyalty.
That's all academic.
Never forget...
to survive in the underworld remember
just three words:
Greatness is ruthless.
Uncle Li.
I know you're a sensible person.
And you won't blame me.
So, I'm really going to turn you in.
Police. I'm turning myself in.
Stay where you are.
Against the wall.
The main culprit is inside.
've already handcuffed him.
I'm just an accessory.
Take the hat off.
Sit up.
Just what drama are you two acting?
I was reckless.
Never thought that girl would play me.
What's that saying? That old idiom.
Caught in your...
Whatchamacallit...
Caught in your own cocoon?
Right. That's it.
You're a perfect example.
Change his handcuffs.
Put out your hands.
We've reached the end of the line.
We should have it aborted...
as soon as possible.
You'd do that?
I don't want it entering the world carrying
the weight of our sins.
Listen to me.
If the child is safe, so will you be.
If anything happens to it
you'll pay with your life.
Mr. Wang.
You know me better than that.
Think I fear death?
What happened?
He's got Dumbo's bag.
Don't go. Let me go.
Don't go. Let me go.
I'll take care of it for you.
Listen to me.
I don't want our child born in a prison.
Don't abandon me and our child.
Get out of my way.
Put the bag down and I'll let you go.
Out of the question.
Think you can get past me?
I'd like to try.
No passage here?
I see.
Good work, little ghost.
Wait.
Can you feel it, old ghost?
Put them on yourself.
Did I ruin your appetite?
No point in waiting. He's gone.
Let me finish eating first.
That day God arranged our meeting
I knew I have seen Spring
That day I missed you with expectation
Not sure what was the destination
That day my heart burst with fire
I saw my fate turning as a tire
That day you were like a mist
Enveloping me so I cannot resist
That day, that day I lost you
Like a girl that lost her bijou
That day, that day stayed with me
A carved memory that will ever be
I'll be a father soon too.
My wife eats just like you do.
Worried about the baby's nutrition.
When he grows up,
don't hide the truth from him.
Tell him exactly who his father was.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
The cloud must know it
With its gentle move
Not to disturb
Our valuable time
Wind
Blows the clouds away
But where are you
When I miss you
I look up with a smile
Do you know it or not
