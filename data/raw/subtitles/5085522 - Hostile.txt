Transport
seven, this is the nest.
Do you read me?
Yeah, I went through
the gas station.
I think there was one of them
hiding in the false ceiling.
Hey, that is not
your job, Juliette.
I'll tell the guys
to check that out.
Did you find anything?
Some gum and some salt.
Nothing to feed 36 people.
Thirty-nine.
There's two newcomers
and Anna just gave birth
half an hour ago.
Congratulate her for me.
Will do.
I gotta go.
My battery's running low.
I'll take the shortcut.
- See you when I get back.
- Be back before dark.
What are you looking at, huh?
- Shut the fuck up.
- You...
Move your hand away.
Now.
Listen to me, you son of a...
Okay, fine.
Happy now, bitch?
Where did it go?
It's still here.
It's inside.
I managed to lock
that fucker up.
You got any food in there?
Cans.
About a dozen.
Wait.
I don't wanna hand
out food for cannibals
or another reaper.
I can't waste a bullet on you.
I beg of you.
You wanna die?
Take your hand away.
But if you wanna live,
I'll take you with me.
Shit.
No!
So, you like Bacon?
I'm sorry?
Bacon.
Actually, I'm a vegetarian.
Very funny.
You... You weren't joking.
Well, this thing here,
it's a Bacon, Francis Bacon.
It's the name of the artist.
Yeah, thanks, I knew that.
A vegetarian and a liar.
May I know why you're here,
as art seems to leave you cold?
I never said that.
This guy just isn't
my favorite artist.
Yet he's the only
one showing here.
And, you know what,
I'm gonna tell you a secret.
This happens to be my gallery,
so I would appreciate
it if you could tell me
what you're doing here.
So I have to tell you,
'cause you're the big guy?
Well, it's raining.
It's raining.
I don't like the rain.
Okay.
Then I have to thank God
for making it rain today.
Oh, that's so cheesy.
Come on, God?
You don't believe in God?
No, you do?
I have my reasons.
And I have mine.
Just wait, one minute.
We're gonna drink to that.
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey.
Actually, I think I'm gonna go,
'cause it looks like
it stopped raining.
Oh, okay.
Well, it looks like
you're stuck here
between me and Bacon.
Interesting sandwich.
So, what are we gonna do now?
Now we're gonna educate you.
The trick with Bacon is to go
beyond the ugliness,
because it's seriously
ugly, isn't it?
But if you look a
little bit longer,
you'll see how Bacon
harmonizes ugliness.
It looks like a monster.
But it's not.
Come closer.
Look at it, until you
see the beauty within.
Open your eyes.
Fuck.
Shit.
Fuck.
You do this often?
Do what?
Go off with a complete stranger
in the middle of
a gallery opening?
Bet you lost some good clients.
Oh, no.
You have no idea.
Nobody even comes
to buy anything.
They just come for
the free food and drink
and to show off.
That's crazy.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, by the way,
there is meat in that one
you have in your mouth.
I was just joking.
It was a joke.
Thanks.
- You're so funny.
- I know.
Oh, this is where I live.
Would you like to come up?
Holy shit.
Give me that.
Would you like
something to drink?
Yeah.
Would you
like tea, coffee?
Got any whiskey?
Sure.
Want ice?
No, thanks.
Did you do these?
Uh, no, it's, uh...
Well, yes.
They're neat.
That's nice, thanks.
Cheers.
Cheers.
So, who is she?
A friend.
A friend?
An ex-friend.
You know, you got a nice place.
You like it?
I inherited it.
From who?
Oh, it's a long story.
You know what goes
well with long stories?
Cheese.
A French man and
his French cheese.
Wait a minute, I'm not
talking about the plastic cheese
you get here.
I'm talking about real cheese.
I've got something
really special for you.
In fact,
it's completely illegal.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, well, I'll come clean.
The gallery is just a cover
and I deal French cheese.
You have to try that.
But it fucking stinks.
That's a good sign.
Taste it.
Oh, my God.
That's fucking good.
- I told you.
- Mm!
I was living in Paris.
So when it happened,
I had to come back
and sort everything out.
The money, gallery,
you know, the apartments.
What about you?
Me?
Well, I don't really have what
normal people call a family.
What do you mean?
I came here to get away
from all that, you know?
It's messy.
Sometimes it's as if I...
As if you should never
have been born,
- right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Haven't you noticed you
something really weird?
You want me to
write you a list?
I'm serious.
We've been talking for hours
and I don't even
know your name.
What should we do?
Carry on like this?
I think it's quite exciting.
I like that.
Actually, I think I gotta go.
Wait, wait, I'm sorry
if I said something.
Oh, no, it's not you,
I just gotta go.
Let me walk you home then.
I will be fine.
Well, tell
me what's going on.
I don't understand.
Please.
Nothing, I had a really
good time.
I just... I just gotta go, okay?
May I have your
number or something?
No,
I... I'd rather not.
At least tell me your name.
Just your name.
Juliette.
I'm Jack.
Bye, Jack.
A lot of places will take you.
All right, come on,
let's get out of here.
Well, you know.
I built that for Christina.
Hey, baby, need a date?
See that shit?
Yeah, man, I bet
she did it on purpose.
- Yeah, what's up?
- A couple of rocks.
- What's your problem?
- Get out of here.
Here you go.
The boss is upstairs.
Go up, he's waiting for you.
Hey.
Come up.
- Who's the guy?
- I don't know, man.
You ever seen that guy?
No, man.
So, how did it go?
Fine.
Who is he?
He's okay, don't worry.
Have fun.
You want a drink?
Whiskey?
I haven't got any.
- Tea?
- Yeah, tea's fine.
Do you mind if I sit?
It's okay.
Thanks.
I like your plants.
That's called an air plant.
Yeah, they grow
without sun or water.
No roots, huh?
May I?
It's strong.
Last time, you didn't
give me your number,
so when I saw you in
the bar, I thought...
Why not follow her home?
What exactly is
it that you want?
I just wanted
to see you again.
Well, there you go.
This is me.
So what?
I'm not here to judge.
You're not here to judge?
Who the fuck
do you think you are
to follow me home and say that?
You're not here
to judge what exactly?
This shitty apartment?
The guy at the door?
Me?
- I can help you if you want.
- Help?
You think I want
your fucking help?
I don't want your charity.
Get out.
Come on, get out.
- Wait, I...
- I asked you to leave.
Get out!
I don't fucking want you here!
Listen, maybe following
you was a bad idea, okay?
Or maybe
you wanna stay.
Is that it?
Is that what you want?
Don't do that.
Don't you wanna
keep the party going?
Why are you leaving?
This is Juliette, I'm injured.
I need help.
Someone answer me.
Answer me, goddamn it.
Answer me!
Juliette, do you copy?
Juliette, Juliette,
are you the...
Juliette, are you there?
Do you copy?
Damn it, Juliette, answer me!
Where are you?
Look, if you can hear me,
you have to do
exactly what I say,
so we can find you.
Now, listen up, Juliette.
You've gotta go in the back.
There's a...
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks
for last night.
Come and try to eat something.
Is it bad?
No, it's not bad.
I'm just not hungry.
Do you wanna talk
about what happened?
Do you wanna talk at all?
What do you wanna talk about?
I don't know.
Maybe about my bad
cooking skills.
I told you, it's not bad.
Great, then I won't fire
the guy who cooked it for us.
You know, when I arrived
here, when my parents died,
I really struggled
with all this.
With all this?
Everything, I mean,
I felt like a fish
in an aquarium.
- It's a nice aquarium.
- Yeah, but it wasn't me.
I had to get used to it.
What I'm trying to say
is you could do the same.
Maybe.
Do you mind if I take a
walk around the block?
You need a fix.
Just be honest, say it.
Where are you going?
Open this fucking door.
No.
- What do you mean, "no"?
- You're staying here.
No, I'm fucking not.
I won't let
you go, not this time.
You
can't fucking do this.
I'm not your little experiment.
Look, I know you're gonna
hate me for doing this,
but you're gonna stay,
as long as it takes me
to get you off that shit.
You have no right to do this.
Help!
You can scream
as much as you like.
I own the whole floor.
Scream.
Oh, that's it, go
ahead, break everything.
I don't care.
That's it, yeah.
Come on, do it.
Give me what you got, come on.
Enough now, that's it.
- That's it.
- Get the fuck a...
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Juliette, stop that.
- Stop that.
- Get the fuck off me!
- Get the fuck off!
- Stop that now, enough!
Enough, enough,
stop it, calm down.
Calm down.
Shh, shh, it's okay.
No.
Mm.
They're almost done.
The rest goes
in the garage, guys.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Hey, princess.
Mm-hmm?
- You okay?
Surprises always make
me a little nervous.
You know what?
My mother used to do
something to make me smile.
She used to do this.
You see? It works.
Can we go in now?
Yeah, let me show you.
Hey, come.
Ta-da!
Huh.
So then, we could move
the sofa there, you know?
Or put some plants.
I've got a few ideas.
What about you?
What do you mean
what about me?
Where are we gonna put you?
You can put me
wherever you like.
Are you sure about that?
Yeah.
Where do you wanna put me?
Uh, a little further.
Watch out, watch out.
Yeah, not there.
More this way, this way.
Stop.
- What do we think?
- That's where I belong.
- Yeah, it's a good place for you.
- Yeah? Okay.
Uh, I might have
to change a couple things.
Come on.
Seriously?
Okay, but you're missing
something.
Oh, God.
Okay.
- Right there.
- All right.
But I don't know if I want you
in the living room...
...or the bedroom.
Then let's have
a look upstairs.
Stop with that game. Come.
Okay, this is
the master bedroom.
It's beautiful.
Hold on, princess,
you haven't seen the view
from the kid's room yet.
The what?
What do you mean
"the kid's" bedroom.
I don't know.
It could be.
- Come here.
- You're kidding, right?
Just have a look.
This is what a child would
wake up to every morning.
So, you want us to have a baby
because of the nice view?
No, just because a child
would be happy here.
And we'd always be here
for him or her.
You don't know that.
Of course I don't, and so what.
There's no way of knowing.
That's life.
And you know what,
we don't need to know.
We just have to try
and make them happy.
Maybe you could
make 'em happy,
but... I don't know about me.
Why are you so afraid?
I'm not afraid.
Do you love me at least?
Do you actually have
any feelings for me?
- You know.
- No, I don't.
I need to hear it.
Say it.
For once in your life, say it.
I have feelings for you.
Say, I love you, motherfucker.
Motherfucker.
Harry, are you there?
Shit, you scared us.
What happened?
I had a bad car wreck.
I broke my leg.
I'm stuck.
Do you know
where you are?
I think I'm near the main road,
heading north.
One or two miles
from the gas station.
Okay,
Juliette, you need to...
And get the...
...activated.
Now we put some instructions...
Can you repeat that?
...it all out for you...
...the beacon.
Locator beacon.
The locator beacon?
What do I do with it?
Hurry. Now, there is...
...you need to follow...
Harry?
Harry, come in.
Okay.
Hey.
I have something to tell you.
Oh, shit.
It's not easy.
Juliette, you know you
can tell me anything.
What do you like about me?
Oh, baby, you
know what I like about you.
I've told you a
million times already.
Tell me again, please.
Okay.
I like...
I like your legs.
Come on, what else?
Okay, I like how you
look when you're upset.
You make a cute duck face.
I do not.
I swear you do,
- something with your mouth.
- Don't be a dick.
No, but you do
something with your mouth.
It's very funny.
- I can't be serious.
- That's it,
that's what you like about me?
- That's it?
- No, no, no. I... I...
I got other things.
Okay, let me think.
I have, um...
Come on.
I like when you say "ditto"
when we're ordering
at the restaurant.
I think since we've
been together,
you've always ordered
the same as me.
That's it.
I have trouble with words
and I'm never quite sure.
Why didn't you tell me before?
I wanted to surprise you,
but I need your help.
With what?
I know what it says,
but I don't know if I got
the instructions right.
"Activate switches...
one and two...
and wait for...
f...
Flashing green light
on case.
You will...
be located.
Good...
luck."
Get off!
Push!
That's it, that's it,
come on.
Good job, come on,
keep going, keep going.
All good, all good.
It's done, good job.
It's okay, baby,
I'm proud of you.
Come on, boy.
What's going on?
Just give it a second.
Wait here.
Juliette?
Juliette, do you hear me?
Do you copy?
Harry, I'm here!
I got your signal.
We're coming for you.
We're on our way.
Hurry the fuck up.
What's that noise?
What's going on there, Juliette?
There's one of them here!
Holy shit.
Why didn't you tell
me that before?
Look, they hate
really bright lights.
Use your flashlight.
I can't, it's broken.
How long till the
chopper gets here?
How long do I have to wait?
They canceled it.
What?
We can't retrieve you,
not before sunrise.
It's too risky with
that thing out there.
You yellow-bellied bastard.
The protocol is clear.
We have to be very prudent here.
Fuck you and your
damn protocol.
I can give you some
advice, some tactics
to help you hold out, but...
You listen to me, Harry.
You better hope that son
of a bitch eats me,
'cause if I get out
of here alive...
you better run.
I'm sorry, Juliette.
You're on your own.
Over and out.
Harry?
Harry?
Harry, come the fucking back.
How many times will
I have to drive around,
looking for you, trying to
find you in the fucking street?
Like a fucking homeless woman.
What should we do now?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Listen, Juliette,
this has to come from...
Oh, this is all my fault.
- That's not what I said.
- But it's what you were thinking.
No, don't tell me
what I'm thinking.
Come on,
I wanna hear you say it.
Why'd I lose my baby?
Our baby.
It was our baby.
You pushed me into it.
Oh, don't go there.
- I told you I couldn't do it.
- Stop this now!
I told you I couldn't do it.
You pushed and you
pushed and you pushed
- until I did it!
- Oh, God, stop that, stop that.
Fuck you!
Fuck you, Jack!
Jack!
Wait.
You know what?
You're right.
It was your fault
we lost our baby.
It's because of all that shit
you pumped into your veins
for all those years, so, yeah,
it's your fucking fault.
Where do you
think you're going?
Taking the subway.
I need to clear my mind.
Your mind or your balls?
It's over.
You and me, it's over.
You know what, fuck you.
I don't need you.
I've never needed you.
Hey!
- There's someone in there.
- Check it out.
Come on, hurry!
Don't you worry.
I'll help you out.
See anything?
No.
Shit.
Just one more for
my favorite girl?
Make it a double.
Thanks, Carl.
Yeah.
You know, um, it's been a while
and, um...
it's good to see you.
Yeah, well...
...don't get too used to it.
Hey, Carl.
How much do I owe you?
I think there's something
really big happening tonight.
Hello?
This is she.
Where?
I'm on my way.
He's one of only
a few survivors.
Even though he's not critical,
don't be surprised
when you go in.
We had to take some
special precautions
because we don't know
exactly what the gas was
that was used
in the terrorist attack.
The gas?
Yes, haven't
you seen the news?
I wanna go in and see him.
You can, but the gas
burned his larynx
and part of his trachea.
He can't speak.
I'm so sorry.
Hang on in there.
You promised me you'd
never let me down.
You remember that?
You promised.
Me too.
Why are you saying that?
They told me you're
gonna get better.
You're gonna get well again.
I don't want us to have...
Fuck.
No!
- Don't try to stop me.
- I'm sorry, you can't...
I'm going,
get out of my way!
What the fuck have
you done with him?
Where is he?
So, can you see it now?
You told me you
don't believe in God,
but do you believe in fate?
Even less so.
I was sure of that.
What, you think everything
is already planned?
I think the universe
influences things
and brings people together.
Like you and me?
Exactly.
So, if I leave now,
what would you do?
I'd probably kick everyone
out so I could walk you home.
You wouldn't dare.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?
Look, I'm very sorry, but
I'm gonna have to close now,
so thank you all for coming.
My apologies and please feel
free to come back tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
Just part of the way, okay?
Yeah, just part of the way.
Jack...
I love you.
