It'll be a while,with this current..
Even if the rain stops, the river won't be crossable
It will be at least six days, maybe even ten...
You seem to be a traveller, master.
The inn must be full with clients
blocked by the rain.
The only one getting wealthy,
is the innkeeper !
We, ferrymen, have nothing.
not even something to wager with !
Quit complaining !
Even if it continues raining,
We have shelter
and enough to eat.
But the flat broke travelers
don't even know,
whether they will eat tomorrow.
Don't run around here naked!
Come on..We don't have spare clothing!
How else am I going
to wash their clothes?
Being nude belongs to the essence of man.
Are we not born nude?
They won't dry !
Where has the sun gone ?
When will this rain ever stop?
It will stop one day.
All rainshowers have to come to an end.
How true ! Well spoken !
That samurai's a fine man,
he doesn't put on airs.
He's always smiling,
not like a samurai at all
Best of all is,
that he's got a commoners appearance.
You have returned.
I went to the river.
We are blocked for quite a while.
I'm sorry, I bring you nothing but worries.
I will make you some tea.
There's a thief in here!
Someone stole rice from me, which was cooking !
I had left to do my laundry...
But I made a mark on the stewpot.
- Her again !
- Let it be...
And ?
Who stole my rice  ?
Who's the thief ?
That's just too much !
Even if it's true,
it's not bearable!
Of course , but...
We must be kinder towards her...
We shouldn't treat her as an outcast.
She has been abandoned, sadly.
She's lonely, looking for attention.
Well, you sanctimonious old fool!
Don't act all innocent !
Me, I've got eyes in my head !
I've known it's you,
since the beginning !
Stop that, please!
Stop it.
There's no one that bad here,
you know that
Leave us.
A warrior has nothing to do here.
Because of my unworthy profession,
I shoud keep silent
when I'm robbed ?
No, Of course not.
But I could repay you...
No, I wasn't..
it's not the reason why I protested!
I'll borrow this again.
Excuse me everyone...
Could you come and help us ?
Unload everything. Put it there.
Master...
What's happening ?
I wanted to alleviate
this long wait...
To work, my friends.
Let's prepare a good meal.
Good, that's all there is.
but long live the good mood !
Don't let my husband heat the sake.
He would drink it all !
Do you see that ?
with all these fine dishes in front of me,
and my cup filled with sake,
What luxury and abundance!
You'd think you were at the
Shogun's court !
Don't get caught with your head between the clouds.
You might fall to the ground !
I must be dreaming !
If I had all this once a year,
I could bear anything !
I've tried to seduce
A snowman
He didn't answer me
but he did melt
A snowman ?
When there's a blistering heat !
That's what I wanted to talk to him about !
To cool us down a bit.
If you don't like that, listen to this.
Look who's coming over there.
It's the dyer O-roku.
That O-roku, I know that song!
It's about a man-eater
who all the men went crazy for!
Shit, so beautiful was O-Roku
she'd make you swear...
because of her beauty
Man-eater or not, I couldn't care less!
I'd sleep with O-Roku!
Well then, old friend,
You'd do anything to get
...
your O-Rokus off!
That's a good one!
The children are very quiet.
They're too busy eating to talk.
Oh, look who's back
Come this way.
I will return your rice to you. Come !
Who do you think you are,
treating others like robbers ?
Going about attacking an old man !
Come on, let's go !
I've kept my part for you,
without touching it.
Look at you !
Come, eat !
No ! Wait !
Don't talk like that 
Everybody can make a mistake 
and later on, you know...
one can be so unhappy about it.
Come on, forgive her.
Reconcile with her.
I beg you... join us.
Come have a bite to eat.
I beg you.
You know...
we're all... a little bit...
listen to an amateur...
A theif arrived
in a watermelon-field
with a rope, he had tied up
and took his legs up to his neck
and ran away
My turn.
The precocious fern
grows up all straight
like the fist rises up straight
on the side of the hill
blows the springtime wind
Listen to me, all of you !
Don't stand yawning with open mouths
when you see the beautifull dancing.
That's allright for now,
but when spring comes,
you'll have a nest inside.
The beautifull mussel from Akita
and the sea cucumber from Tsugaru
forage on the beach alone.
The mussel attaches himself to
the cucumber and strangles him.
The sea cucumber finds himself
totally dissolved.
Seducing the wife of another
It's the scream
the time it takes to loosen
a kimono and undress
being together all night
without speaking of the sweat
when the husband emerges,
jumping in the sandals quickly
here's the scream
I'm sorry.
I ask your forgiveness.
You have participated in a duel...
In all sincerity...
I have indeed fought.
I didn't have a choice...
after hearing them...
really...
they were all embarrassed.
She was furious.
In truth, I...
You did promise me not to
get personally engaged in any duels.
Really...
I had left
to pawn my sword...
but the pawnshop-owner was absent...
It's really the truth. Forgive me.
I won't do it again.
Would you please accept
This.
Just take a little bit...
to prove your forgiveness.
My big sister was so cold
that she warmed up
her backside at the stove.
She was so happy about it
that the stove began sqeaking everywhere.
It stopped raining!
It has stopped raining, it's true,
but you won't be able to cross the river
for some time.
Anyway, it stopped raining
and that's great !
Master !
Thank you very much
for yesterday-evening !
You made the rain stop !
Right !
We owe you a lot.
Master !
Where are you going to
on such a great morning ?
Just going for a walk. After this rain,
I feel totally benumbed.
What could I be good at ?
I wonder
For me, it doesn't matter,
but there is also my good wife Tayo,
Come on, pull yourself together,
Misawa he
Stop this waste !
Useless to interfere !
One last time !
- Do you really want to fight ?
- Yes !
Stop !
Stop, I beg you !
No !
Swords are not made for butchery
... if not they're used by imbeciles.
They're here to supress
the stupidy in our hearts.
Who are you, idiot ?
I am right...
Get out of here !
It's a man's fight !
- But...
- Silence
I am sorry !
Stop !
That's enough !
Private duels are prohibited !
Fools !
- you dawdlers!
- Your horse, sir...
In comparison, our horses
are no more than jades.
Shut up !
Bring me those idiots.
I don't know with whom I have the honor,
but, for stopping this ridiculous duel...
I, Shigeaki, Lord of this fief,
express my sincerest gratitude.
I watched everything with great attention,
from the top of that hill there...
As a matter of fact, it was very
impolite of me.
Not at all.
I was enchanted to assist
a demonstration of such quality
and by a bare footed man,
If you permit me...
I thank you.
Are  you staying over here ?
At the Matsuba Inn.
I'm called Misawa Ihei.
I'm a ronin.
With all this rain,
I couldn't cross the river...
I see... It must be overwhelming.
Tell me...
to distract youself, What would you
say about coming to the castle ?
I wouln't know !
Well, then...
I before you,
sent by the Lord of this fief.
am Gonnojo, the chief of his guard,
at your service.
I also belong to his guard
and I'm called Masahiro.
His lordship summons you to the castle.
Give us the honor of your acceptance.
I humbly thank you.
Would you give me a moment...
I must prepare myself.
Sure. Take your time.
Divide this between the lot of you.
It's a carp.
Cut in pieces,
it's really delicious in soup.
What a situation !
The lord of the fief summons me.
I know.
But...
What to do ? Have you seen my atire...
Put on that kimono.
But... how did you do it ?
His Holiness!
Welcome !
I hope my invitation wasn't
too inopportune.
No, not in the least.
Put yourself at ease.
The other day, you had prevented
young idiots of my clan
from killing each other.
I thank you again.
Please.
Allright... lets cut the preliminary
chatter.
In fact, our master of arms
died six months ago
and still hasn't been replaced.
We're looking for his successor.
I've seen many candidates,
but until now,
none of them were satisfactory.
This room is much too ceremonial
for us to discuss something.
let's go outside.
We'll talk in the garden.
To tell you the truth...
watching you the other day,
I've thought about you as our
master of arms.
That's why I wanted to
get to know you
Without embarrassing you.
In my youth,
I have worked as an
accountant
of a small fief in the north-east.
but, I must confess
that I was bored a lot
staying seated after my desk,
from dawn till dusk...
I left the fief.
You fled?
Yes. Edo, the capital, attracted me,
but I had to leave secretly
and I didn't have any money.
and then, what did you do?
A friend taught me
an excellent method.
On the way to Edo,
there are numerous fortifications.
There should be fencing-schools.
Take your chances with them.
Duels ?
Certainly not ! I wasn't strong
enough for that !
What did you do ?
I took on a very serene posture
and, without affronting the students,
I asked the master
to teach me a special stroke.
Thus I affronted the master and
just before he stood up to me,
I would renounce.
You would renounce ?
Yes. I would lower my wooden sword,
throw myself to the floor and I would
proclaim that I was defeated.
How would that permit you
to pay for your voyage ?
My attitude would put the
master in a good mood
and he would do me favors.
He would invite me to his table,
offer me a drink
and he would even go so far as
to give me some money for my travels.
I see !
What a great tactic !
That way I was able to reach Edo.
And what did you do then ?
Happy to finally be there,
I roamed the streets
of the capital
When I came across a big dojo.
I hesitated for a moment
but, decided to make it my ultimate
goal, I stepped over the threshold.
I arrive at Tsuji Gettan's,
The master of the school of the unity.
Tsuji Gettan ! ?
Nobody ignores that master over there !
So you entered and did you defy him ?
Yes.
But no... you can't go about
defying a man like him...
It's unthinkable.
Precisely...
It's just this 'unthinkable'
that happened.
Master Tsuji,
accepted my challenge
without being begged about it.
Thruth and subject are one.
I asked myself...
at what moment I would throw down
my sword and declare myself defeated...
I renounce !
I don't understand !
What happened to him ?
I was also suprised.
Without understanding his reasons,
I had revealed my secret intention.
and, Master Tsuji...
I understand now.
To this day,
I have fought
with an uncountable amount of men.
But you were different.
Though you gave the impression
of being badly prepared,
You stayed calm and showed
no desire to win.
I didn't understand you.
I didn't know what to do.
That's why
I lowered my sword.
I am truly beaten, today !
That's Grand !
What a nice story !
And then, what did you do ?
Master Tsuji took me on
as an apprentice.
He treated me with great affection
and I succeeded in becoming
an instructor.
Thanks to him, I was able to be
engaged in the service of a fief,
But it didn't last.
I really couldn't make it there.
My reputation deteriorated.
I had to leave the fief.
After that,
I've served two other fiefs...
and now, I have no master.
My wife says
that I wasn't made to serve a Lord
and expects nothing more of me.
Another thing, I would like to take
a closer look at your sword...
Can I ?
I beg you.
Gon, where is the sword of our guest?
In the sword-depository.
To say the truth, he's called 'Gonnojo',
but 'little Gon' fits him better.
And now,
let us have a look at the garden.
With all this rain,
It's been a long time
since I set foot in there.
With your permission.
The  forging of fine grain...
delicately moistened...
very well drawn groves...
a proud blade
has the freshness
of a spring breeze.
and it's perfume.
It's not signed.
But no less admirable because of it.
Where did you buy it ?
It's master Tsuji
who gave it to me.
They say the sword
is the soul of the warrior...
It's really a splendid piece !
Anyway,
it must be hard to be a ronin.
Sometimes it's hard and even painful,
but sometimes it not that bad
and even fun.
You meet all kinds of people
in all kinds of situations.
In comparison,
serving a Lord is tiresome.
The officers are all,
without exception, arrogant and blunt.
Their conversations
are uninteresting and spiritless.
They provoke only boredom.
Our Lord loves slander.
He also loves to give nicknames.
silence !
This being said,
I also gave you a nickname.
I know it.
'badly recieved pumpkin'.
pale skinned
and never letting go...
of your exalted butt.
I'm beginning to get hungry.
What time is it ?
I've sent my pages and
the women away.
We'll serve ourselves.
I'll do the introductions.
My chief-vasal, Ishiyama Kihei.
'mule-face'.
The second vasal, Akashi Butayu.
'The scarecrow'.
I am Misawa Ihei...
at your service.
These two here are
the antiquities of the fief.
the old-fashioned geezers.
I don't know if they have real value
but I know they're really old.
Okay, everybody take their rolls
and take it easy.
The dishes are beautiful
but the contents aren't worth it.
Especially for me
whose health is under constant watch...
They forbid me to eat any greasy fish
and while the fish is being eaten,
I always eat my cold soup.
It's really horrible !
The other day, I wanted to give
some fish to the cat of my concubine.
She smelled it,
looked totally disgusted
and preferred to leave the room !
Oh yes... I have chosen
our master-of-arms.
Here he is.
I've had a wonderful day.
The proposals were interesting
and I have refound pleasure.
Sir, this post is very
important.
We must proceed with the
greatest precaution.
You doubt my judgement?
Gon !
This man has fascinated me.
What do you think of him ?
Your judgement is sound.
I've also had the honor of meeting
the wife of Sir Misawa
and the excellence of their characters
has filled me with admiration.
but, in choosing a master of arms,
everyone must agree
and tradition demands a
demonstration...
Again 'tradition' !
I don't think it's necessary !
If we fixed a date so he could
demonstrate his talent,
would that be appropiate for you ?
At your service.
mule-heads !
I will remain angry !
Facing us three,
dojo masters,
he has won each duel !
It's intolerable !
Sir, that was all a trick.
He has shown himself so
humble and so delicate...
He has fooled our vigilance !
That such an individual has
been invited to the castle...
it's incomprehensible !
He's a devious man.
He knows how to sell himself...
with extreme politeness.
Either way,
the master of arms of this fief
must be one of our own.
If not, how will we uphold our
pride in this stronghold ?
No worries !
His Holiness is very attentive
to details...
We won't let a buzzard steal our
cheese !
Listen to this !
He left in a carrying-chair
with a following covered by gifts.
I thank you.
If I find any food,
I'll bring it to you.
Hello again.
Rejoice yourself.
I've been appointed to become the master
of arms of this fief.
At least, I think it's decided.
In fact, It will be official when
I give a demonstration,
but the Lord said that's superfluous.
So it's practically acquired.
He really appreciated this sword...
He's very well-informed... of everything.
Have you waited for me ?
I am sorry. I've been to a banquet
at the castle...
Here... It's a present for you.
In fact, you've been brought up
during the dinner.
It didn't prevent the lord from
truly amazing me.
He understands things so well...
He's really passionnate.
I told him.
This samurai is a good man.
He's not a ordinary person.
He's even nice and attentive
to someone like me !
A hero on a heap of manure !
We don't deserve him.
It's true !
Take it, it's for all of you...
a gift from the Lord of this fief.
He's an absolutely
excellent Lord.
What are waiting for ?
Well,
the three masters of the city dojo
Should have come but
they haven't arrived yet...
Are they the only combattants ?
No. Two men of our fief
are also ready.
Moron ! Why not start with
them ?
We begin !
Nabeyama Tahei. At your command.
Misawa Ihei. Pleased to meet you.
I give up !
What a pity. Are you allright ?
I haven't hurt you ?
Not at all.
Next !
Inuyama Handayu.
Pleased to meet you.
I surrender !
Next !
The dojo masters still
haven't arrived.
They have prefered to avoid
the confrontation !
It's no use waiting for them.
Go, Gon ! Go there and face him.
A thousand pardons,
Sir Misawa is far too strong
for me to face him.
Somebody else then...
Is there nobody else ?
That anybody who wants to,
name himself !
You bunch of yellow chickens !
Very well ! I will go myself !
Let us wait a moment longer...
Silence !
Tell me ! A training lance
isn't really interesting.
What if I used a real one ?
Good.
Bring me a lance !
Be carefull !
It's a real one.
Don't think about scratching
the lintel.
Okay !
Here I am.
I beg you.
No reserve between us !
What an impardonnable error !
I was caught in the middle of the game.
A thousand pardons.
Are you safe ?
Silence ! Shut up!
Don't worry. Our lord calms down as fast
as he gets angry.
He knows the value of things.
He would never defy a man,
that he would like to engage
as master-of-arms.
It's a good remedy.
As for me, I don't know
when I will ever learn...
Very well, I will go.
I will call you a carrying-chair.
No thank you.
I thank you for your kindness.
Those court-clothes fit you
incredibly well !
What's this about an asshole wanting
to become master-of-arms of the fief?
It's so funny it makes me piss my pants !
And who are you?
Have you forgotten about our duels ?
You had us good the other day,
But this time,
it'll be different !
Draw !
Draw, you beggar of a ronin !
Wait a moment.
I have disposed of all my gains
and thus I can't give you anything,
But it could happen
that I have to renounce
becoming master-of-arms...
Following the events of today.
Shut it !
Take guard !
If there is one day
to be angry at myself,
It must be today.
I get angry and when I lose
control over myself...
I answer to nothing , attention !
You're talking !
Let us not go any further. That's enough.
Did something happen ?
Nothing at all.
Did you get angry again ?
In fact, during the battle,
I was completely balanced.
I wasn't as moved as that,
but the one who drove me over there
excused himself so excessively
that I thoroughly lashed out at him.
It's childish of me, I know,
but the benevolence of the winner
wounds the heart of the loser.
I had the impression of being mocked
and I was furious.
This man interests me a lot.
But the benevolence of the winner could
indeed wound the other.
Without a doubt.
No one likes to be pitied.
It hurts your self-esteem.
It must be hard for people
who are strong.
When a man is that skilled
and that good-natured,
these qualities would surely make
you detested.
Wait !
He told me...
that he always had trouble
when he was employed.
So that's it! I see.
It must be !
Good evening !
There you are again.
Do you want to have dinner ?
Tonight, I would love...
to have some sake.
Understood.
Everybody left today.
It's become very calm.
They were all so nice,
so good,
although they had hard lives.
Aside from that, they were all
warm-hearted and touched by humanity.
Poor people have no other support
than mutual aid.
They can't survive if they only
think of themselves.
The old sermonizer...
He told me he was never happier
in his life,
and that he learned, at his age,
that the world was a beautiful place.
And that,
even if he couldn't get any younger,
and whatever the difficulties,
it was great to be alive.
I thought my heart
was going to burst.
Let's leave it at that.
You're much too...
Anyway,
All this ended well.
I think it should be said.
In fact, I've won all
the fights today.
It's true that at a certain point,
I possibly went too far,
but it should be allright.
It already happened...
Yes, but this time, the Lord is
a whole different class all together.
Of course,
I can't be sure...
but I really believe that,
this time,
I can have faith in him.
I would like to believe that too.
Do you want some more sake,
or do you want your dinner ?
Right... I almost forgot...
I should eat a little.
I'll be back in a while.
What a nice day !
We need a clear sky.
For a few clouds down here.. 
can mean rain in the mountains.
we need to cross the river
on a day like today.
Are you leaving ?
No... I'm just...
going for some air.
Hello ! It's a nice day.
A fabulous and blessed day.
I pray for the happiness of you
and your wife !
Concerning the weather,
nothing to tell...
We should get some news today.
We can't leave without
saying something.
That's true.
That doesn't withhold me from
preparing everything, in case of...
Naturally. We'll have to get out
of here by all means possible.
There they are !
You are an exceptional swordsman.
Your skill is without equal
and your confidence unsurpassable.
His Holiness intensly  wishes to name
you master of arms...
No... Your praises are excessive.
I don't deserve them.
However every time,
despite a small setback,
The decision is made to recruit
you...
an unexpected problem emerges.
This problem is not of our making.
It's entirely yours.
You participated in duels.
You fought for money,
in the city dojo...
which you took after you won.
You must remember...
It's true. I do remember.
I remember but...
It was for people really,
sincerely in need,
Boarders of this Inn.
Whatever the reason,
for a warrior, it's the ultimate
dishonor,
fighting for money.
Besides, because there was a
complaint,
custom requires that the fief breaks all
ties with the responsible.
With great regret,
you must forget our job offer.
His Holiness has asked me
to give you this money to
contribute to your expenses on the road.
But no, I didn't know...
Don't worry about me.
I have already been ...
Please...
But of course.
We accept with recognition.
My husband was wrong to participate
in those fights.
For a long time,
I've been begging him
to stop doing that.
However, I see that I'm wrong.
I have just realized.
My husband knows, for sure,
the dishonour connected with those duels.
Yet knowing this, he still participates.
There are times when he
has no choice.
But I understand now.
The important thing,
is not what he does
but why he does it, isn't it ?
Can't people like you
understand that ?
Stop it, Tayo. Let's not be impolite.
Right, I'll stop.
However...
I have something to tell you.
From now on,
Every time it seems justified...
participate in duels
when by doing this, you'll be able...
to help the poor, the weak and
the miserable
find a little happiness.
Madam...
Take this with you.
Whenever your sandals
are hurting you...
it's tabacco-ashes.
with some saliva, it's works nicely.
It's not that great...
But it is, it's very nice of you.
Thank you very much.
And to say that they despise
a Master as yourself !
That Lord is nothing but
parade-carp !
What ?
It may look like a carp,
but it's empty on the inside.
Don't say that.
The Lord of this fief
is a good Lord.
To be truthful...
I really thought that it was
a place where I could have served.
And his wife said that the important
thing was not what he had done
but why he had done it.
Right?
Yes, that's right.
And then...
'Can't people like you
understand that ?'
You, what did you answer ?
Huh ?
You blunt mule face !
Bring this man to me !
Otherwise, I'll have you cut into pieces
and fed to the carps of the pond.
But you allowed him to discharge himself.
Can't I ask you anything,
you retard !
My horse !
Your a beautiful human being
without equal,
You don't know whether to open up,
that's strange, isn't it ?
But for me, it's allright that way,
You don't push people aside
nor do you take their place.
If the opportunity arrives,
you help the sincere, even the poor,
find hapiness and hope,
whichever way you are, you are fabulous,
I'll go work up a sweat.
It's alright, let's go.
I've put aside my regrets.
Take courage !
I have plenty of it.
I believe I can say that.
This is so beautiful !
What a superb view.
It's true.
It's really magnificent.
One feels the vital force
bubbling in the entire body.
