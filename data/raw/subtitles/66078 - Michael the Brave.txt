Victory!
Calugareni
For more than one hundred years,
Europe has trembled under
the attacks of the Ottoman armies.
1593.
Sultan Murad III urges
his troops to Vienna,
under Sinan Pasha's command,
to defeat the last obstacle between
them and a divided Europe.
As a miracle repeating over
and over along the centuries,
these armies have to face
three insignificant principalities:
Wallachia, Transylvania
and Moldavia.
All three would play
a crucial role in this battle.
In these troubled times, a man
would rise in the right place,
to fulfill its destiny.
Patrascu's son was meant to perish,
to flea or to win the battle,
to become a prince.
MICHAEL THE BRAVE
THE BATTLE OF CALUGARENI
Eat, milords!
Feed yourselves!
I see you're weak!
Or maybe you don't enjoy
my lunch.
Of course we do!
- Is it good?
- Yes, it is!
Do you hear me, Pavel? This will
teach you to rise against me again!
Spike him!
- Eat! Don't you like it?
- Of course we do, Your Highness.
They're afraid of me. But it's
the only way, in these times.
I am faithful to you, Selim Pasha.
Tell it to the mighty sultan!
I gave you two charriots
full of healthy children.
I know we don't have do it
anymore, but...
I'd give you two charriots of gold,
if you gave me
you know whose head.
What if he deserves more?
Voivode Alexandru
has forgiven you!
No. As I haven't forgiven him.
Michael, I was always your shadow.
I did what you wanted me to do.
Our home has turned to ashes.
We are hiding abroad.
The voivode has put a price
on your head. Where wil it end?
I'll go all the way, Stanca,
no matter where it may lead me.
Alexandru's men are after me.
I stopped just for a moment.
Where's Nicolae?
- I hid him.
- Where?
- I'll take him with me.
- No.
His life is in danger. Alexandru will
want revenge, if he sees I'm gone.
- No. You can't have him.
- I'm not used to this kind of words.
You should learn. You've taken
everything from me, Michael.
Even if you succeed,
you can't give me back
my serene and short happiness.
Don't worry! No one will touch
my son. Not even you.
Especially you.
As you have risen against him,
voivode Alexandru has ordered
your capture, general of Craiova!
Not inside the church.
I fear a trap.
You're handsome, but stupid,
Hassan.
Don't you understand?
I made a promise.
There's too much silence.
They, too, feel something
in the air.
Selim Pasha...
The Buzesti brothers...
You're right on time, Mihal.
How did you get away?
It was easy, Selim.
Radu... Father Stoica...
Brothers, let them pass this time!
Only this time.
But without the children!
Nobody move!
For the love of me,
let them pass with what they have!
These are children from our land.
Why, Michael?
Without his help,
I can't go to Istanbul.
I know him well enough to know
he never let his pray loose.
Selim is my childhood friend.
Please, let him pass!
Make way!
Let them pass!
Michael!
Mother...
You, too, have sold them your soul.
The son of voivode Patrascu...
You don't care about anything!
You want the throne at any cost!
You'd cover yourself in shame!
I damn you for all eternity!
You stand and watch your foe
mocking your people!
Don't curse me, mother!
The Prophet's teachings are great,
but I still don't understand.
Why do you need to rule
over such a wretched country?
I want to be the mightiest man
in this country.
Mihal, my friend...
Here, we are the mightiest of all.
Look at me!
Which one of you is stronger?
Does anyone dare fight him?
You! Come here!
Do you want this knife?
Yes, sir.
- You have to earn it.
- I will, sir!
Punch him!
Beat him!
Do as I tell you!
Do as I tell you!
Wait!
Now you beat him!
Enough!
Get up!
Kill him!
These are my children, Mihal.
What's your name?
Hassan. Before, when I was ugly
and dirty, it was Ionica.
Now it's Hassan. You can kill me,
you're still an unfaithful to me.
You learned to contain yourself,
but not entirely.
Had I not loved you,
I would've had to kill you.
Maybe you'll be sorry
you didn't do it.
You haven't changed, Mihal.
- Selim, I want to ask you something.
- I'm listening.
Why did you join
Sinan Pasha's army?
Allah whispered to me that one day
I could become grand vizier.
You're dreaming, Selim.
Mihal, will your uncle lani
give you the money?
I don't know.
Two days ago, Alexandru offered me
two charriots of gold for your head,
and now I'm losing mine,
going along with you.
Allah didn't give me the brains
my mother would've wanted him to.
This one will make us rich.
If he's willing to pay this much,
how much money does he make?
Let him pay!
We'll settle later.
Mihal!
Alexandru's here.
Lani, give him
whatever he asks for!
Think again, Michali!
This is a great deal of money.
No. We'll pay what he asks.
Come on! Move!
Get out!
We need another 300000 coins.
I gave you my entire wealth.
I swear on my beard!
- I'll pay you back.
- Yes, but you know how it goes...
520000 coins in all. This means
543000, interest included.
- I told you it's not enough.
- Sign here!
I talked to Di Ventini, the richest
banker of the Genovese quarter.
- He's waiting for you.
- Di Ventini...
- You won't see a coin from him.
- Why, Selim? How do you know?
He won't pay even his respects.
I'm sorry, Signor Michele,
but I'm afraid I have to say no.
Rosana!
This is prince Michele.
If there is any other problem,
I am your humble servant.
Rosana, you entertain the prince!
My brother Carlo is the image
of our much praised impetuosity.
I am Rosana.
I'm curious... Could you tell me
the subject of your conversation?
I'm sure you heard everything,
contessina.
It's so exciting to see men
fight for their goals!
You then start to see their weak
points, their touching side.
You didn't plea for your cause
too well.
- I'm not used to asking.
- Then how will you get anything?
I've been living here for many years.
It's a strange world.
The shortest way is never
the right one.
A smile may bring death,
while a frowning, life.
Let me ask you something!
How old are you,contessina?
Prince... Is the house of Di Ventini
your last option?
Yes.
- What if you don't get the money?
- I die.
You don't seem a man
of simple judgements.
ContessinaRosana,
have you ever thought
that there are men who wait
to watch the sun?
For them, this moment may never
come, but they still are trying.
What did the dame say?
She's the one who runs the business.
What did she say?
Tell me word for word!
- She said this was a strange world.
- Will she give you the money?
I don't know.
She didn't say anything.
- Is she beautiful?
- Why?
This means you've grown
older than me.
Mihal, think it over! We still may
leave tomorrow, alive and well.
My money...
Ventini afendi...
Please, come in, Your Excellency!
Signorina contessa,
I'm your humble servant.
My sister was so curious to see
your true oriental decorations,
that she convinced me
to take her with me.
Today I tried to look at the sun.
It's hard.
- My eyes were full of tears.
- Thank you,contessina.
Signor principe,our house
thanks you for your demand.
Our mild doubts had nothing to do
with you.
I tossed and turned in my bed
all night long.
If Alexandru pays Sinan Pasha
a greater sum,
it's your head the sultan
will cut off, dear nephew!
Look at him, pig!
Woe to us!
Sinan Pasha agreed to take
your money. He wants to see you.
You should barely speak.
He's wreckless and moody.
You mizerable sod!
Is this him?
Young man, where do you think
you are? At the Court of Rome?
Before the mighty sultan, you bow
to the ground and kiss his slipper.
Let me see you!
Right... That's it.
Rise!
You made a good first impression.
I heard good things about you.
You walk in fear of God,
you are rich...
I heard very bad things
about your rival Alexandru.
We learned some proof about
his betrayal to the great sultan.
But... you may not be to his liking,
either.
Your Highness, we did everything
to please the almighty sultan.
Did anyone ask you anything?
Let's go!
We don't know what the thoughts
of this man are,
while Alexandru has always
submitted to us.
There's Alexandru!
Dear Christ...
Help us, Virgin Mary!
Only Allah can help you here.
Have mercy on me, almighty!
Have mercy, great sultan!
The hearing's over.
Wait! Stay a little longer!
Leave us alone!
Come with me!
I like you. Here, all you see
is crawling backs,
even those who have the hoofs of
their horses full of Europe's dust.
But I could've not liked you.
How could you dare?
We only have one life,
almighty sultan!
Right... Too bad!
Master! Have mercy on me!
Almighty sultan!
Murad! You'll be sorry!
You'll be sorry
to have chosen him!
Mihal bey,
what do you think is Allah's
most precious gift to man?
- Life.
- You couldn't have said otherwise.
You're too insignificant.
You'll be reigning over a small land.
One day, your lords will bribe
my men, as you did,
and I will give the order.
Man's greatest gift is power,
Mihal.
The most precious one
and the most tiresome.
- Listen!
- I'm listening, almighty one.
When you leave, you'll be a poor
prince of some small country.
Your neighbours will humiliate you,
you'll fear us... Stay here!
When young,
Sinan was a Christian, too.
I'll give you an army and then
you'll know what power is.
What do you say?
I'm not an army man
and I don't want to disappoint you.
- I care too much for my head.
- Too bad!
Allah will sometimes put
petty souls into strong bodies.
Why?
- What was Alexandru shouting?
- That you'll be sorry you chose me.
You don't care too much
for your head.
Indeed, I may be sorry one day
that I chose you.
Why don't you get in, your Highness?
Everybody wants to meet you.
I came here to thank you.
I must leave.
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you help me?
You're not like the people
that usually ask us for money.
I was impressed to see
that you didn't know how to beg.
- Do you know where my country is?
- Now I do. East of Transylvania.
I'll be travelling there soon,
at Alba lulia.
A friend of mine,
Christina von Habsburg,
is getting married
to prince Sigismund.
I'll be close to your country
and, normally, I want to know
what happens to my money.
I'm talking nonsense. I'd very much
like to know your country.
Bucharest - December 1594
- We've been robbed!
- Give us our money!
They locked the gates!
They robbed us!
They must pay their debt!
Why are you laughing?
I barely saw my father. We've been
hiding, he was on the road...
I don't even know if I can recognize
him, dressed like a prince.
He got to the throne
with our money!
Pay your debts!
Give us our money!
You robbed us, you thieves!
Give us our money, you thieves!
Let him come outside
and pay his debt!
Be courageous!
I'm glad I find you in good health,
Your Highness.
What kind of a ruler is he?
He never pays his debts!
- He's hiding!
- Michael, what's going on?
Nothing.
Who are these men?
Why are they shouting?
You're imagining things,
Stanca.
- Nicolae!
- Preda!
- I'm so glad to see you!
- Nicolae!
Welcome! Come with me!
Preda...
Present our son
to the Lords' Council!
Wait!
You don't need these trinkles.
Don't you have anything
to say to me?
I missed you, Stanca.
I waited for your arrival.
Thank you, especially because
it's not true.
You put your life at risk
for this throne, Michael.
Was it worth...
Milady, your rooms are ready.
- Radu!
- Enough! Silence! Stop whining!
I want to know if you give me
the money or not.
We've already done it once.
We're wondering...
What, Filimon? Do you or don't you
have money for the Turks?
What about the gold coins
I gave you?
You're buying weapons,
but never pay the tribute.
Who spoke?
I am too dumb to speak,
but, if we can, we'll pray...
Pray in church, milord,
for forgiveness!
The Turks don't forget
about their tribuite.
We're a cursed country,
Your Highness. We're poor.
- What did you decide?
- We're with you, Your Highness.
Stand straight, Nicolae!
What do you say?
Buzesti! Selim bey is free to enter
wherever he wants.
He should see how faithful we are
to the great sultan.
Faithful? You haven't paid
the legal tribute for six months.
The soldiers who guard your throne
didn't receive their pay.
Sinan Pasha is upset.
This is why I'm here.
The country is poor, Selim bey.
Didn't you know it
when you asked to be prince?
Stroe!
Selim Pasha...
Even though some lords
don't want to pay anything,
all the debts of my country
will be paid today.
We have gathered the money
in the house of the brothers Buzesti.
I want to please everybody.
Announce the crowd!
- You came a long way, Selim.
- A very long way, Mihal.
Is it ready?
Yes. Do come in!
We'll pay for everything!
Thank you.
- He lives in fear of the Turks.
- You said it!
If it weren't for them...
I was ordered to speak to you
like this and this is what I did.
You can kill me, Mihal, but I don't
know why you wanted to rule here.
I know what you're worth.
Earlier, I was talking to the prince,
not to my friend.
I know, Selim.
I thank you for this.
Stroe!
To the charriots!
Mihal!
I liked it!
Now I recognize you!
Like in the old days!
Jump, Selim!
Selim, take your horse, go to Sinan
and tell him what you saw!
You are free. You talked to me in two
different ways. I answered the same.
What is it, Radu?
It's the house we were born in,
Your Highness. But we are glad.
Don't worry!
It was old, anyway.
Long live the prince!
Forgive me, son,
for not trusting you.
- I'm sorry.
- What did you think, mother?
Is this what you think of me?
That I can sell my country?
And you? What did you think?
That I, voivode Michael,
would drink this cup of shame
to the last drop?
From this day on, I free myself
in front of God and you
of any debt and submission!
And I will free all those
who are with me!
We have our life and our honour!
Wake up! We've been sleeping
too long!
The existence of a wall between us
and the Ottoman Empire is mandatory.
The territory of the 3 principalities
must come to our attention.
As we appreciate
the determination and noble courage
of Sigismund Bathory,
prince of Transylvania,
who cast away the Ottoman rule
and became our precious vassal,
we chose our nephew, archduchess
Maria Christina de Gratz,
to be the valliant prince's wife.
Calm down, Sigismund!
This marriage is to show the world
we want to make the prince...
My dear cousin, if my adhesion
to the Christian cause
forces me to suffer the martyrdom
of this marriage...
General Basta will ensure with our
troops Transylvania's independence.
Will the general explain his strategy
for the other two principalities:
Wallachia and Moldavia.
Herr general...
Your Majesty...
Gentlemen...
I'm happy.
I've always dreamt of becoming
a humble protector of the cross,
of giving my life in revenge
of the sacred wounds of our Saviour.
This day...
Dear Boris, the fate of our coalition
is sealed.
The fate of the two neighbouring
countries is of great concern to me.
Here are the messengers
of prince Aron of Moldavia,
who announced that they accepted
to be vassals of Transylvania.
You'll make friends with the devil,
to meet your goal.
I will properly settle things
with Wallachia.
This young man walks
on my nerves.
Prince Sigismund, don't forget
Wallachia is under Turkish rule.
Does Your Majesty think Murad
would invade Wallachia?
In his place, wouldn't we do
the same?
What do you know
about the new prince...
...Michael Patrascu?
He's a most unreliable character,
Your Majesty.
With money and shrewdness,
he bought the throne from Sinan,
whom he seems
to be friends with.
He has recently paid his creditors
by setting them on fire, like boars.
What can we think of a man who meets
his commitments in such a manner?
He's an adventurer.
He wants to gather money and leave
for a quiet corner of Europe.
Your Eminency, we are glad
you are so well informed.
What other details do you know,
general Basta?
Your Majesty, as a tactician,
I'm interested in two things:
Our enemy and our ally.
I understand prince Sigismund wants
Wallachia to be our battle ground.
We must protect the dwellings
of the civilized world, Your Majesty.
Wallachia is a country only by name.
It has no master.
Braila
Cernavoda and Zimnicea
Nicopole and Vidin
Get up, Preda!
There's more 'till Istanbul.
Down with your weapons!
Rusciuk
On your knees!
- Preda!
- I'm here, milord!
- Preda, do you remember your Latin?
- Yes. I learned it in Padua.
Let me hear you!
Good... Tonight you will prepare
for a long journey.
- Milord... Now, when...
- Preda Buzescu!
Tonight you're leaving for Rome.
Your deeds are worthy
of your Roman ancestors.
Tell the valliant prince Michael
that he is not facing alone
this pagan Goliath.
Can we then count on the help
of the Holy Roman Church?
The Romans were famed
for their practicality.
I'm glad to see this virtue
has not wasted away.
Tell prince Michael
that the Holy Roman Church
will support his actions
not only through its warm prayers,
but with all its financial might.
How can I interpret these precious
words, Holy Father?
I see why you're saying this.
The army of Rudolph of Austria
will join you at the soonest.
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti, amen.
As for us, my son...
Big words, but petty interests!
I can assure the Holy Father
that I'm in great difficulty.
I could bearly soothe the pure
passion of prince Sigismund.
- But general Basta's ambitions...
- Plots and childish pride!
You've been everywhere,
but you never said a word
about this Wallachian prince.
Your Holiness, all our reports
saw him as faithful to the Turks.
He seemed unreliable.
This unreliable man makes his way
to Istanbul by sword, Your Eminence.
You will go His Majesty king Rudolph
and you will see that Basta's army
leaves right now to the help
of prince Michael.
Benedico te.
Charge!
Stanesti and Serpatesti
Giurgiu
Razgrad
Varna
Adrianopolis
What is this?
- Selim Pasha's coming.
- Selim Pasha? How dare he?
How can you have the courage
to come to my face?
You bastard! You had the nerve
to tell me you knew him.
- Didn't you ever suspect anything?
- No.
Then, you're a fool.
- What do you think he'll do?
- He's cunning and swift.
He'll fight us until the end.
If he gets help...
He will conquer Istanbul,
before I get the chance to be there.
And I wander through these sands...
It's only your fault!
Who sent you here?
The almighty sultan is waiting
for you in Istanbul, the soonest.
What about you?
The great sultan made me head
of the armies that fight in Persia.
Charge!
Go get them, brothers!
My God, father...
So much water!
It's salty!
Prague, 1595
It was just the right moment.
Sinan was busy fighting in Persia.
The Wallachians' attack
took the Turks by surprise.
General, you explain everything
in such a crude manner! Funny...
Didn't you invite this prince
to the Council's round table?
I, for one, cannot trust him.
His victories are
the result of hazard.
- Your Eminency, what do you think?
- The Lord works in mysterious ways.
Indeed. This unreliable man who
used to pay tribute to the Turks
has amazed the entire Europe.
We must help him.
Allow me to take leave,
Your Majesty.
A brilliant tactician
with the pride of a child!
The mere idea of another's success
makes him hate him,
even if he doesn't know him.
What is the Holy Father's advice
to me?
Your Majesty, this time I bring you
the gold promised to the Holy League,
to gather an army
against the pagans.
You should've told me this great news
at the beginning of our hearing.
I must confess this is
a most pleasant surprise.
I'm happy I can be of some use
to you, Your Majesty.
- Still, I'm worried.
- I'm listening, Your Eminency.
Do you think we can trust
this stranger with the gold
that the Holy Roman Church wishes
to donate to the Crusade?
I was thinking that prince Sigismund
was the most...
Don't get me wrong!
I won't have it.
I'm not that mad as to give the much
awaited money to the first comer.
We will organize an army.
You will go meet prince Michael.
You will crawl inside his soul,
a primitive one, I suppose,
and you will give us details
and then we will decide.
I'm anxious to see prince Michael
among so many heroes!
I have the feeling I see scenes
from the Iliad.
Your Highness... Our Holy Father
sends you this cross,
as a sign of that which
you are fighting for.
When will the army arrive?
Preparations are almost ready.
The Holy Father and Emperor Rudolph
decided to give you all the support
you asked for.
The great general Basta will join
swords with your invincible army.
When?
- In five months.
- Five months?
You're too great a tactician, not to
see that such an attack takes time.
Look over there, Your Eminency!
And there. Do you know what these
warriors expect? To raise my arm
and tell them that 10,000 mighty
soldiers came to their help.
Then, they would howl for joy and
bring down the walls of Istanbul!
With or without Basta,
I would have been there in a week.
- Preda!
- Yes, milord!
Call the men!
We're going home.
How, milord?
If I hear another word,
I'll cut your head off!
Your Eminency, maybe I was wrong
to ask for help in Rome.
You're the cousin
of prince Sigismund.
Do you think he would agree to help
me keep the Turks to the Danube,
until the Christian army
gathers up?
You were right to think about your
Transylvanian brother.
You'd better ask him personally.
I will bless the friendship
between two princes reigning
over two neighbouring countries.
Then, we'll leave together.
The noble count Gaspar Cornis,
great champion of the Hussars,
is honoured to fight against
the prince of Transylvania,
count of the Székely people and ruler
over part of the Hungarian country,
Sigismund of Bathory!
I dedicate my battle
to the noble lady, the archduchess
Maria Christina of Austria,
my beloved fiancée, whom I think
of as most beautiful and pure,
and I will fight to prove it.
I hope that, after our wedding,
the prince will find a better way
to waste his energy.
- Do you love him?
- He's nice, but he's childish.
You talk to your prince! He's awful.
Do you think he can speak?
Anyway, he knew.
Your Highness, today it's sunny,
the colours are shining...
Won't you smile?
You're right.
I was deep in my thoughts.
Forgive me!
I didn't want to upset you.
I don't have this right, Rosana.
I owe you money.
Had we been to Bucharest,
would you have set me on fire?
- What kind of a man is Sigismund?
- He's the way you see him.
Had I taken him out with a pole,
he wouldn't have stood up.
Applaud!
Michael of Wallachia!
I'd like us to start our friendship
with a chivalrous contest!
Don't say yes!
For Christ's sake!
My dear friend, we are not here
to fight and have fun.
Your Highness, fighting with
the lance is a knight's pride.
I thank you for making me
this honour, Sigismund.
Don't, Michael!
Prince Sigismund of Bathory,
never beaten!
He will face prince
Michael of Wallachia!
- Dear God, help him!
- Who's he?
Voivode Michael,
the one who beats the Turks.
You can't compete without a helmet!
It's against the rules!
Let's hope God will teach him
a lesson. It'd be best for everyone.
You can't do it!
It's against the rules!
Go on!
He asked for it.
Rosana Di Ventini,
you never told me anything!
Are you all right?
Anything broken?
No. I'm fine.
You're crazy. Don't you know
he did it for you?
- My God! You shook him hard!
- He bit the dust! He asked for it.
Your Highness, no matter
how much my pride has to suffer,
I'm honoured to shake your hand.
- You deserved this victory.
- It was an accident.
No! Please! You proved to be
a fine handler of the lance.
Milord... We don't have time to fight
between us, but with the Turks.
And another thing:
They are excellent lancers.
A very subtle politician... Brave
as Achilles and shrewd as Ullyses!
I get it, although my cousin
the cardinal says I miss subtleties.
You know what?
Let's have our talk right here!
It's nice here.
It smells like horses.
And strong men. I feel I'm your
friend now. Let me speak as such!
I studied your proposals
and I agree to them.
May God be with us! Sigismund, I'll
tell you something you don't know.
The Turks can be defeated.
My dear friend... Always the same!
Right to the point.
I want to ask you...
Can you beat them all by yourself?
No. That's why I'm here.
I wouldn't want to offend you.
But, for those who can help you,
what are you?
- I'm myself.
- No, my dear friend.
I'll tell you once again,
even if we had to fight again.
You're nothing. Most of the people
never heard of your country.
I know you could kill me
for these words.
What are your relations
to the European courts?
To count on Rudolph's help,
I, Sigismund of Bathory,
have to marry his niece! Compared
to her, Lucrezia Borgia's a saint!
- How many men do you have?
- All the men in the country.
Please...
Let's forget about these big words!
I know you're in pain.
You're proud.
Have you ever received any help,
except for the cross that my cousin
asked me to send you?
So, it was from you.
We were all wondering who this
Michael was and how he was like.
Was he a man
or was he half bear?
The king of Spain
doesn't know his own empire,
and you want him to know you?
Face the reality! Your actions must
be supported by a name
that is a guarantee
for all European kings!
- That is, your name, Sigismund.
- Right.
To the entire Christian world,
the house of Bathory
and that of Habsburg
are your only guarantee.
But, if your pride goes before
the interest of your country...
Think it over!
Together with the entire transalpine
Wallachia, with all its virtues,
and under the merciful
and deep protection
of the most praised prince
of Transylvania, Sigismund Bathory,
we, voivode ruling over this country,
receive his gracious protection.
Our common purpose is to fight
against the wretched Crescent.
May God help us!
Amen.
Here signs, God willing, the prince
of the Sacred Roman Empire,
of Transylvania, Moldavia
and transalpine Wallachia,
count of the Szekely people
and ruler of part of Hungaria,
Sigismund Bathory.
Here signs our representative
Michael Patrascu,
our beloved faithful ally.
What was worse is over. Now you
can count on our full support.
Gentlemen...
Let's celebrate!
With all these ceremonies, I didn't
get the chance to congratulate you
for your many victories.
If I ever get the chance,
I will be happy to give you
the command of my cavalry.
Go to hell!
I wouldn't have believed it
possible...
All my hopes were
with His Highness Michael...
I was hoping he'd remember
us Romanians here,
for we are under fierce oppression,
milords...
Shut up, man!
I was afraid you'd left.
You're so sad, Michael.
May God have mercy on him,
if he doesn't keep his word!
I will be the end of him.
He'll curse the hour he met me.
What about you, Rosana?
I've been waiting so much
to see you!
I imagined our meeting
in a hundred ways.
I must tell you...
Will we ever see each other
again?
If you stay here, yes.
I want to speak to Selim Pasha!
What's the name of the river
in front of us?
Romanians call it Neajlov.
How many men and cannons
do they have?
About 16,000 men
and 20 cannons.
Tell me, Selim Pasha... Did you think
I'd fight the Wallachian,
while you played the hero
in Persia?
Yes, Sinan Pasha.
That's what I thought.
Do you remember you brought him to
the Court, to take over his throne?
It's been a long time,
but I remember.
Tomorrow you will wash away
this shame.
Allah be with us!
What's this noise?
Mosquitos. We're in swamp land,
Your Grace.
Milord...
I want to ask you something.
Do you want me to make you
a metropolitan?
No. I want to stay with the army.
I don't want you to regret one day
that we joined our fate, father.
- The Lord is stronger and wiser.
- Maybe, but this is what I want.
Father, guess who's here!
Stanca... You, here?
I brought you another 300 horsemen
from Oltenia. I knew you'd need them.
You're so brave, Stanca!
As always.
Nicolae, my son, go to sleep!
We have a hard day tomorrow.
- You look worried.
- No... I'm just sad.
They let me down again.
I humiliated myself in front
of that lier Sigismund!
I thought he was a Christian,
just like me.
I thought we'd need one another
in front of our ennemy.
I was wrong.
We have an old saying:
"Better an enemy,
than a friend who's a lier."
Where did you find
300 horsemen?
I gathered them how I could,
then I bought weapons and horses.
Michael...
I want to ask you something.
- Can I do anything for you?
Yes. It's very important.
- I know that...
- Nicolae.
Yes, Nicolae.
Let me take him away!
Only God knows how tomorrow
will end.
He's our child.
Your heir.
Go, Stanca! Do what you want!
Maybe it's my fate to be left alone.
The Transylvanians are here.
Count Kiraly!
Your Highness...
Do you think it was wise to choose
such an uncomfortable place?
How many men did you bring,
Your Excellency?
500 Szekely men.
My prince and your ruler
is disappointed that he couldn't
bring his army.
But he is now in Alba lulia,
where he is celebrating his wedding
with the duchess
Maria Christina of Austria.
500 men?
Is this the promised help?
Your Highness, my experience as
a warrior is greater than you think.
I'm fed up with talks
and promises!
Father Stoica, show the count
where he can place his men!
Milord, I'm knight Tompa.
You can cut my head off,
but it's not my fault.
It's that one...
May the Devil take him!
We, the Szekely men,
we'll fight with your 'till death.
We know you.
We heard a lot about your reign.
All right, Tompa. Thank you.
Tomorrow, my sweet wife, you will
see a most wonderful tournament.
I hope you'll have enough energy
left, to be a winner.
I'm impressed by your cold attitude
in front of all these beauties.
You have the most troubling beauty
I've ever seen.
I'd give my principality,
in exchange for your good will.
Your Highness, in politics,
deceit may be a virtue.
In love, though, it's the emblem
of the weak.
As beautiful as rich
and merciless!
In fact, I'd forgotten your heart
belonged to our valliant Wallachian.
Our vassal...
Poor Kiraly!
Who knows where he is now?
I don't see why we sent him there.
With or without him,
the Wallachians
will lose the battle.
And, if he wins,
who'll rise up to his pride?
Win? How do you think that
the Wallachian could crush Sinan?
Don't get excited, gentlemen!
No matter what the outcome,
we are still the true winners.
- We?
- Your Eminency, we planned it all.
Have you forgotten that
the Wallachian is my vassal?
His victory will make the entire
Europe know the bravery of my troops.
If he wins, Sinan will pay dearly.
His weakend army will have
less chances in a battle with us.
Indeed! He'd even have to build
garrisons in the conquered towns.
Sheikban Pasha!
You'll take the command
of the centre.
You'll charge the bridge with
the Janissaries of the first line.
It must look like
the ultimate attack.
I'll send the second line
in your support.
You'll go on attacking him
1,000 steps beyond the bridge,
then you'll fall back,
as if defeated.
You must lure the Wallachian
to this other side of the bridge.
Mustafa Pasha!
You'll leave the Wallachian 1,000
steps from this side of the bridge.
Then, you'll charge along the river
with your right wing.
Rumelia's armies led by Hassan Pasha
will do the same thing on the left.
Then, we'll catch him in a clasp.
You may go.
If the Wallachian crosses the bridge,
he will fall in our trap.
Satargi Pasha, you stay as reserve,
behind the hill.
And you, Selim Pasha,
will stay with me.
Anything against it?
No, Your Grace.
I haven't seen so many Turks
in all my life.
They're like the leaves of grass.
If the Turks cross the bridge,
you strike on the side, to the right.
I'll attack them on the left.
Father, you help the pedestrians!
Don't go back a single step!
It is time.
May God help us!
The second line and 20 cannons
will enter the battle.
For the bridge, at my command!
Charge!
Follow me, brave men!
Charge!
Give the signal!
Stop!
Don't cross the bridge!
It's a trap!
Don't cross the bridge!
Stop!
Do not cross the bridge!
The Wallachian is not stupid.
Let all Pashas gather for council!
The Wallachian stopped at the bridge,
but he moved all his troops.
He doesn't have
any hidden armies.
Mustafa, you will make a wide detour
with the Anatolian armies.
Then you will cross the Neajlov
and, from the other side,
you'll strike the Wallachian army
on the side.
We'll do the same
on the left side,
with Rumelia's armies,
led by Hassan Pasha.
The bridge will be under attack
by the Janissaries and Spahis.
Get going!
The first round was a child's trap,
plotted by Sinan.
The true battle begins now.
You'll fight too now, brothers!
I call the Stone troops!
Let's go!
The Wallachian engaged
all his forces in battle.
Now's the time for Hassan
and Mustafa to attack.
You'll enter the battle
and not give in one step.
Where's Hassan? Where's Mustafa?
I'll cut their heads off!
Mustafa! Charge!
Fall back!
You'll go back in order!
In order!
We lost. Let's fall back!
What? We came and saw everything,
and now you want us to flea?
- I won't do this.
- It's an order.
I won't listen to such orders.
Come with me!
Your Spahi seized their cannons.
Where's that stupid Hassan?
This wretched swamp!
We're lost.
Let's go round it!
What would you do,
if you were me?
Do you think I'm too old to fight?
You're the one who's helpless,
you with your damaged hand!
It's our turn.
Listen carefully!
We can still beat them.
Brothers Buzesti... And you!
You will attack on the centre.
I'll come on the shore,
towards the bridge.
And you, Cocea...
There's a hard time
ahead of you.
All I ask of you is follow me!
Don't you forget!
It's better to have an enemy
in the ground, than in our country!
Follow me!
What?
Your Grace... The Wallachian
leads new troops.
They attacked us from one side
at the bridge.
Shut up, you fool!
It's his last breath! Fight on!
Fire!
He had less than 300 horsemen.
Charge!
- What is this?
- They went to our camp.
- We're lost!
- Call the retreat!
Don't run away! Wait!
The Turks are running away!
Don't give it up!
Fight, you brothers!
Follow me!
Charge!
Sinan Pasha!
Sinan Pasha!
Sinan!
Victory!
Victory!
Help me, Selim!
Can I do it,
with this damaged hand?
Or should I save the sultan's flag?
I promise you anything,
if you save me!
Don't stand there!
Help me!
Victory!
Victory!
Your Highness,
I gathered the wounded.
All is ready. There's a wounded Turk
who wants to speak to you.
Hassan?
My name's Ionica, milord.
It will be until I die.
Let me be your faithful servant!
Take care of his foot
and treat him with honour!
From now on, I want to see him
at my side. Let's go!
So many dead, milord...
Too many!
I know.
The Romanians will never forget
this battle.
Nor will our enemies.
