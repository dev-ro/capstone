She's fortunate that

That's when someone abducted him.
He's been found now.
Thank the Lord that he
was found safe and sound.
Yes.
Jai, you've done a great job.
Thank you and God bless you.
Seriously,
how do we repay this favor?
How can we help?
If you feel...
we've done you a favor.
Then don't say thank you.
Instead...help three people.
And...ask those three.
to help another three people.
I didn't get you, son.
Hold this.
Just like l helped you.
you will help three more people.
And you will ask them to
help three more people.
So 3 into 3 is 9.
Into 3...27.
27 into 3 is 81.
When 81 people help 3 more...
-243.

nt0 3?
729
When 729 people help..
-2187.
Into 3.
- 6561.
Into 3?
- 19683.
Into 3?
- 59049.
59049 into 3?
- 170.147.
And if 170, 147 people help 3 more'?
And when they help three more?
Then we'll have to call Shakuntala Devi.
430,416,721.
Correct?
- That's correct.
Wow!
And similarly this help chain..
...will grow from thousands to millions.
Son, that's a great idea.
We will definitely help three
people when we get the chance.
Amazing.
He turned such a regular thought.
"into such a big ideology.
You're right.
people should understand.
But he's right.
Brother-in-law's a genius.
Jai.
Proud of you.
Take care.
Hey!
Hello.

Mother. I guess he got
scared and ran away.
Let's go.
Come on.
Stupid girl.
Don't talk nonsense.
Let's go.
Sister, I am really sorry.
The reason my
brother left the military...
..was his bravery,
not cowardice.
Captain. Captain.
Captain, come in.

Leave that area now.
End the mission right now.
- No. sir.
Innocent children have

It's the high-command's orders.
You have to fall back.
Get down. dammit.
Get down now.

Captain Arjun, come in.
Abort this mission right now.
This is High-command's order.
Listen to me.
“Jai ho!"

High Command's orders.
Sorry, sister.
It's okay.
- Thank you.
No thank you,
help three people out.
Whenever you get a chance.
And ask them to help
three more people.
Yes.
That's Jails ideology.
You don't have to be in the army..
..or be a politician
to serve the country.
He's a good man.
“Your eyes are so stunning...

Uncle.
Is there anyone with you'?
- No, I am alone.
Uncle, it's quite late.
Go home.
I am tired of waiting
for a rickshaw or taxi.
But no one's prepared
to go to Vasant Nagar.
I'll take a look.
Rickshaw!
Come. uncle.
The rickshaw's here.
Come. Careful.
Very good.
Where do you want to go'?
Where to?
Uncle.
Uncle, give him your address.

My rickshaw‘s from Mira Nagar.
And I don't get a fare back.
Find yourself another rickshaw.
Let it be, he's old and also drunk.
So, will he get in my rickshaw?
I won't get a return fare either.
Where will he go at this late hour?
Fine, let's go.
Thank you.
No need to thank me.'
Just help three people
whenever you get a chance.'
Uncle, no need to thank me.'
Just help three people
whenever you get a chance.
We've reached your home.
You brought me to the right place.
From today I am your fixed client.
- Great.
Keep it.
Thank you.
On 'Jan-Manch' today we're talking..
..about security of VV
P..
Better learn these chores, Ann.
It will come in handy
after marriage, dear.
By the way, it's not important for me.
But it will be great if she learns it.
How hard are you going to try, Sumit’?
Mom, you too.
Hold on, let me hear.
How justified is it spend the
common man's earning like this.
And other than that,
when VIP convoy‘s
..set out on roads, the common
man has to face difficulties.
We'll now talk to our
Chief Minister Ashok Pradhan.
So, Mr. Ashok Pradhan,
what would you like to say?
You know, honestly.
Security measures
shouldn't trouble the people.
..or it should trouble
them as less as possible
Unfortunately.
politicians are human beings too.
And human beings make mistakes.
The only problem, when a
politician makes a mistake.
..the common man has to pay for it.
What do you think about the new CM?
He's given a diplomatic answer.
The most important issue is..
..when people misuse
the security system.
We'll take strict actions against them.
There's a positive vibe.
He looks like a nice man.
Good man.
What's the point
if he is a nice man?
He's a puppet after all.
No, he's a nice man.
I heard it too.
Forget that.
Jai, give me your hand.
Shake hands.
I did it.
Jai‘s formula,
to help three people.
..instead of saying thank you.
I spread that ahead.
Come on, food's ready.
Let's eat.
Have you heard
the latest about him?
Quiet.
- What happened?
He has donated his eyes.
And owing to his actions these days..
..seems like someone
will soon get an eyesight.
Shut up'!
That's the limit.
Curse you.
Look. Jai. I want to explain you something.
Not everyone in this world is like you.
- Are you crazy?
And given to the conditions these days..
...everyone's busy
with their own problems.
Everyone will willingly vouch to help.
But no one will do it.
And look, Jai.
You've to make me a promise.
If your idea doesn't prospen.
..then you won't be disappointed.
I won't be, mom.
Chill.
What chill..
Really.
This thought is so nice and noble..
..that I definitely want to help.
But I just got married.
And that's why I was very busy.
So I didn't get a chance or time.
But as soon as I get
some time or opportunity.
...I will definitely help.
- No problem.
We haven't forgotten what you did.
We even remember your thought.
We want to take it forward too.
But the past few days.
..we've been doing rounds of
the visa and passport office.
My son Ronnie and his wife..
..are migrating to Canada.
No one helps anyone here,
or wants to.
Everyone's busy with
their own problem.
Some are worried about a job.
some about finding a girl.
I've seen the world.
I speak straight.
Some will say sweetly,
some will say it decently.
Some will say
“l want to help you".
Ask him...
did you do anything?
Did you?
He'll say
“
 didn't do anything".
You're living in an illusion..
..that somethings going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Fine, sir.
The times are bad.
No one helped anyone.
Why don't you start?
n might make you happy-
Nonsense!
Sorry, sir.
I shouldn't have said
that to you.
I apologies.
Sir. Sir..
Sir.
This is yours.
This is yours.
Oh no. Come on.
I'm packed too.
Forget it.
Jai, whether anyone
does anything or not.
We will try.
Yes.
Sir, I am hungry.
Please give something.
- I said get lost.
lam hungry.
- Get lost.
Who talks to a child that way?
Sir, I am hungry.
Give me some money.
I said get lost.
Jai.
Jai.
-Jai.
Jai, listen to me.
Jai.
Child.
Sumit, she's bleeding.
What have you done?
- What's your problem?
Jai, leave it.
- Prob
em..
Hey!
Oh, God!
Stop it.
We're trying to help
three people here, and you..
Forget it.
Jai, let him go.
Jai, control yourself.
Take it easy.
Get lost.
Just chill.
Poor girl.
Just chill.
I won't spare you.
Get lost.
Jai, you hit the window.
I didn't see it was closed.
Tend to the child.
Are you fine?
It's a minor injury.
There's a limit to being cruel.
What happened, dear?
Mister. Mister!
Who are you?
- I am her father.
Father?
What father?
He was playing cards.
He's hale and healthy.
You're absolutely fine.
and making your child beg.
What kind of a father are you?
-Jai.
Jai. Jai.
I told you to relax.
Do one thing, apply this.
-Yes.
Look after yourself, dear.
Come on.
What's wrong?
- Why is brother-in-law so depressed?
Something happened?
Nothing. he picked
a fight on the road.
With whom?
Forget it brother-in-law.
You know Jai.
What's wrong. Jai?
lam disturbed, what else?
Look at the chain of events.
One after the other.
A girl whom I helped out
of the blue".
..committed suicide
in front of me.
I find a kidnapped boy.
A poor girl gets
beaten up while begging.
The more I try to run from reality".
Why do only I see these things?
Everyone sees them, Jai.
Others ignore it.
You must have heard people saying.
“L went out of my way to help him."
This “Out of the way" is your way.
Because that's who you are.
And that's what
separates you from the rest.
You're not meant to spend.
..the rest of your life in a garage.
You will bring a change.
I believe it.
How and when, we just
have to wait and watch.
I believe it.
Evil is like poison,
it spreads fast.
And goodness,
is like a medicine.
It takes time,
but it's effective.
Cheers.
Fatty, why don't you
come to school these days?
The school's too far,
I've to walk.
I get tired.
Here, take my cycle.
This will help you exercise,
and no more excuses.
Thank you.
- Don't say thank you.
Just help three people
whenever you get the chance.
And ask them to help
more three people.
Get that.
Hey, uncle.
- Get lost.
Where are you, darling?
I've been waiting for you.
Wow, mom. What a place.
I love this place.
- Isn't it?
Hey, this was my idea.
Uncle, I love you.

Mom, Pink Panther.

- You what?
Peanut.
Peanut? I'll show you.
"My name's pinky."
Kabir, let's go.
Time for yourtuitions.
Come on, I'll take you.

And time for mom's walk as well.
Yes, I'll take her too.
