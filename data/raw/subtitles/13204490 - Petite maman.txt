"Alexandria".
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mom...
Can I keep her stick?
Yes.
Put your belt on, Nelly.
Say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
- Aperitif time?
- Yes.
We have arrived.
- Where's your room?
- It's this one, on the right.
There's the fridge, if you want
to put it in the cellar.
Wow I can't move it.
We shouldn't start here anyway.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Where did you make your hut, mom?
In the woods, just behind the house.
Will you show it to me?
I have work to do here.
There are three or four trees?
- Four
- Like a square.
Yes.
I want to build one too.
Which hut?
Mom's hut when she was a little girl.
He forgot about it.
We painted the wall
around this cupboard.
Do you remember that, Marion?
I remember.
I'm going out.
What's that?
My stuff when I was a kid.
She had kept everything.
She was not very good at spelling.
- You were a good drawer.
- You think so?
Look at this smoking fox,
it's well drawn.
Yeah, it's looking good.
I'm depressed just having
to bring all this home.
I went into the woods too.
Time to go to bed.
Does it hurt you to be here?
I liked that room.
But I didn't like it at night.
- Why?
- Children's matter.
I'm a child, I'm interested.
It's bedtime for all children.
You always ask questions
when you have to go to bed.
That's when I can see you.
You have to wait.
Wait for what?
Wait for your eyes to
get used to the darkness.
That's when it appears.
The black panther.
At the end of your bed.
I could hear its heart
beating in my pillow.
Louder and louder.
But it was just mine.
- Do you see it?
- No.
I don't see it either.
I'm sad too.
Tell me...
I didn't say goodbye to her.
You always said goodbye.
The last goodbye was not good.
That's because I couldn't know.
She couldn't know either.
We don't know about that.
You're right.
We don't know.
How would you have
wanted to say goodbye?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Wait.
I slept in the living room.
- With mom.
- Yes, she told me about that.
She's sad.
I know.
She decided to leave this morning.
We thought it would be better.
- I have a mission for you.
- What mission?
The cupboard in the hall.
After that we leave quickly
from here to see her.
Dad? What's that thing?
It's a paddleball.
You hit the ball and it comes back.
So it's meant to be
played alone.
Yes, in a way.
Perfect.
Will you help me?
What's your name?
Marion.
Come.
Give me your sweater.
Do you want something to drink?
Yes
Take a seat.
You didn't tell me your name.
Nelly.
I'd never seen you before.
I am at my grandmother's house.
Who's your grandmother?
She died last week.
We're emptying the house.
I like to eat chocolate like that.
My grandmother died last year.
She had the same name as you.
The bathroom is at the
end of the hallway?
Yes.
Are you leaving?
Yes.
My family must be worried.
Ok, bye.
Bye.
Dad?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
I was afraid you were gone.
I'm here.
You put your sweater on backwards.
Take it off.
Did you like playing paddleball?
The elastic's broken
and I didn't find the ball.
I found the place where
Mom built her hut.
The trees were as
she had described them
Don't you remember it at all?
No.
The one she built just
before her operation.
You didn't really forget,
you just didn't listen to her.
You're right.
That's a nice rope.
I'm glad you like it,
but that's mine!
- I'm gonna use it to pack the books.
- But it's so long.
Good.
I cut here...
A little more. Hold it.
How old are you?
I'm eight. And you?
The same.
Any brothers and sisters?
No. I'd like some.
Me too.
Are you thirsty?
How long are you staying here?
I don't know.
The time it takes to clear the house.
We could do stuff together.
I have to go home now.
Ok.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Want to come with me?
- What colour do you want?
- Blue.
Ten.
Three.
Six.
"Each player picks a goose."
Where's the six?
You skip a turn, I play twice...
Five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Hi!
"You're in the dungeon.
Back to square one."
No!
Hello.
Hello, ma'am.
Did you go out, Marion?
I was careful.
The doctor will tell you again later.
He's less patient than me.
We won't tell him.
We leave in an hour.
I'm having an operation soon.
Ok.
If they don't do it now, I'll have
my mom's problem when I grow up.
When's the operation?
In three days.
What's up?
You look miles away.
I think I've made a new friend.
Do you mind if I smoke?
It's bad for you, but go on.
Thanks.
- Can I sleep at her place?
- When?
I don't know,
she didn't invite me yet.
We are still here for two or three days.
You're allowed to sleep
at her place if she invites you.
But don't go there uninvited.
Did Mom's operation go well?
She told you about it, didn't she?
Yes, but she may not have told everything.
We never talk about your childhood.
We talk about that all the time.
Yes, but that's just short stories
What do you mean by that?
I know every Christmas present you had,
or the fact that you loved pizza...
I don't know about the real things.
What do you mean by "real things"?
The things you were afraid of, for example.
I was afraid of many things
like everyone else.
Tell me about one thing.
Have you forgotten?
No, I have not.
I was afraid of my father.
How will you die?
Stabbed in my sleep.
And why will you be killed?
For the money.
I come from United States but I
own a Coca Cola factory in France.
So you're very rich.
I'm fine, yes.
Then again, there's the crisis.
Okay, so who else would
you want to be?
The Inspector.
I'm going to be the Countess.
So you also play...
the Countess's son,
and the maid.
I'll also play the Inspector's wife.
And the reporter
No, otherwise there will be no scene
between the reporter and the countess.
I play more characters than you.
It's fine, because I have a big role.
Could you help me with the tie?
Of course.
Come here.
There you go.
Thanks.
"Bulb".
Where?
Here.
So here it's...
"Ablution".
Here, there's "zone".
You're quite good at your age.
Would you give me
that glass of water?
Thanks Nelly.
It's been a long time
since I've said that name.
I went to bed at 9.
It was still daylight.
And when I woke up,
He was lying dead next to me.
He died between 3 AM and 6 AM.
So, did you really not
notice anything wrong?
He was quite worried lately.
He was facing problems at the factory.
What kind of problems?
I don't know, he was secretive.
What about you?
Me?
Are you secretive?
You know... A secret...
It's not necessarily
a thing you want to hide.
It's just that you don't
have anyone to tell them to.
I'm listening.
You play very well!
You too.
I would like to be an actress.
Really?
Yes.
It's my dream.
You could become one.
- You think so?
- Yes.
I'm tired of staying inside.
Can't we go to your place?
Not possible.
Why?
A bad atmosphere.
That's because of your grandmother?
No.
My mom left.
Why?
Dunno.
I'm sure she'll come back.
Are you afraid for the operation?
Yes.
Ask her if you can come...
to my place, but meet me in the hut.
I'm glad we've met.
Are you okay?
I've decided to make one
of your dreams come true.
Which one?
Well, guess.
Cutting your beard.
This old school stuff is cool,
I wanted to try it.
Close your mouth.
Hi.
You're handsome.
Thank you.
- Are these the books you want to keep?
- Yes.
- You want me to read you one tonight?
- No.
I want to sleep because
I can't wait tomorrow.
So we activate the time acceleration?
Ready?
Ready.
Thanks, it's better
than I imagined.
Marion?
I have a secret.
Well, it's not only mine.
I'll tell you too.
You have to know it.
What's going on?
Promise me you'll believe me.
I'll believe you.
I'm your child.
I'm your daughter.
So you come from the future?
I come from this path behind you.
Show me.
How old am I?
31
She dies when I'm 31.
That's old.
Not that old.
She always talks about it
as if it were tomorrow.
Always.
She said...
"This may be the last time
we see each other."
She already says that.
Have you kept her stick?
Yes.
It smells like her hand.
You liked her a lot.
Yes, very much.
Nelly?
That's my father.
What are we going to do?
Go.
It's done.
We take our stuff and we can leave.
I thought we were leaving tomorrow.
I thought that too but
I worked hard.
Can't we leave tomorrow morning?
Today's Mom's birthday.
It will be a nice surprise for her.
I don't understand you Nelly.
Aren't you eager to see her again?
Yes, I am.
So what's the problem then?
I wanted to stay one more night.
Are you leaving?
Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
I wanted to invite Nelly to
sleep at my place tonight.
See? I've been invited.
I see.
Why are you leaving now?
I'm going to get back to Mom.
It's a shame, we were
going to make pancakes.
Yes it's a shame.
Another time.
There won't be another time.
Thank you.
You've put way too much milk in it.
It's fine.
No it's not.
It's not fine.
Wait, wait, wait...
You've got half a mustache.
Come in.
You're late.
Sorry.
When was the last time?
One year ago.
Are you hurt?
An accident.
You're hopeless, Inspector.
I wanted to see you again.
I wanted to see you again too.
Why?
You know very well.
Tell me anyway.
Because I love you.
Come away with me.
This won't be possible.
I have family in New York,
we could start over.
Don't you want to know
why I've brought you here?
Yes.
Shh, shh, it's okay.
This is our baby.
He's beautiful.
This is why I can't leave.
He looks like you.
Come on girls.
First the soup, then the party.
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you Marion...
Happy birthday to you...
One more time.
Why did she left?
Your mom.
She didn't tell me.
What did your dad say?
He doesn't say much.
But he's sad.
I feel like...
...everyone has questions.
You too?
Yes.
You were young when you had me.
And?
I don't know.
That's what you're telling to me.
So, I'm listening.
When?
23
Did I want to have you?
Yes.
I'm not surprised.
Because I'm already
thinking of you.
What time is it?
7 AM
When do you go to the hospital?
At 12.
We have time to do one last thing together.
Is it music from the future?
Yes.
Let me hear it.
Should I take some games?
They must have some there.
But will there be other
children to play with?
Take them.
Are you afraid?
Afraid of what?
Afraid I won't come back.
Everything will be fine.
I'm talking about the future.
I'm talking about your mom.
Yes a bit.
Why?
Because you're often unhappy.
You're not often happy to be here.
I think it's not your fault.
Do you think so?
Sometimes I think that.
You didn't make me sad.
- Goodbye
- Goodbye.
Sorry.
For what?
I left you here.
Don't be sorry.
It was nice.
I wanted to see the place one last time.
- It feels weird.
- Yes.
Marion?
Nelly.
