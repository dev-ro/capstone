'When Joan was only one,
she already knew where she was going.
'Going right? Left?
'No - straight on. '
'When she was five she was writing,
"'Dear Father Christmas,
"'I don't want a doll,
and I don't want a big red ball.
"'What I want is a pair of silk stockings,
"'and I mean silk, not artificial. "'
'She was 12 before she got
her first silk stockings
'and they were artificial.
'See? All the other girls are waiting
for the bus.
'And waiting.
'Look - here she comes,
straight for the milk van.
'Is she going to get a lift? She is. '
'At 18, she's a working girl
and still knows what she wants.
'A boy wants to take her to the movies,
twice a week, if she'll let him.
'She would rather dine at the best hotel
in town, even if it's only once a month.
'There she is, that tall, skinny girl.
'Will he take her? He will. '
'She's 25 now, and in one thing
she's never changed -
'she still knows where she's going. '
Good evening, Miss Webster.
Good evening, Léon.
Hello, darling.
I thought you were spending
your holiday at home.
Sorry, darling, but you see me most
weekends. Did you bring my money?
Yes. Here you are.
47 pounds 11s 9d.
Sign the receipt and count the money.
- You don't mind my taking it all out?
- It's your money.
As your bank manger, I prefer you to
keep the account open. As your father...
- Nothing for me.
- You must have something tonight.
He'll have a sherry. You love sherry.
- And the usual for you, Miss Webster.
- Thank you.
- What do you mean, usual?
- Gin and Dubonnet.
You've no consideration for my position.
Oh, darling, be reasonable.
Think of all these girls -
their fathers have positions.
Not everybody's father's
a bank manager.
Thank you, miss.
Darling.
Please stop being a bank manager
for once, just be my father for tonight.
Now, Joan, I've come
all the way from Eccleshall,
you know I don't like being seen
in expensive places.
- You know what my clients would say...
- Daddy.
- I'm going to be married.
- What?
- Your table, Miss Webster.
- Thank you, Fred.
Let's go in, darling. Bring your drink!
Diamond, eh? Who is he?
Excuse me.
That's your works pass. You can't marry
Consolidate Chemical Industries.
Can't I?
No other name on this except your own.
Then...
- You can't mean...
- Just what I do mean.
Robert Bellinger's
one of the wealthiest men in England.
Anything wrong with the soup,
Miss Webster?
We were talking. It’s cold now.
Will you take it away?
Now, look here, Joan, stop acting.
You're not Lady Bellinger yet.
Anyway, you'll come with me
to the station?
- Tonight?
- I’m picking up the Scotch express.
- You're going to Glasgow?
- Further, the Western Isles.
Have you got a ticket?
There'll be a queue.
It’s all arranged.
I’m going to an island called Kiloran.
- Where is it?
- In the Hebrides.
It takes a day and a night to get there.
It’s his island, we're going to be married
there away from...people.
- Have you ever been there?
- Often.
- What?
- In my dreams.
He's told me all about it.
There's an old house
and the war's a million miles away.
There are the famous sands and sheep
and birds and grey Atlantic seals.
Bellinger must be nearly as old as I am.
And what's wrong with you, darling?
- Come on, Daddy, let's dance.
- No, no, Joan.
Oh, come on, Daddy, you can dance.
You taught me to dance!
- Good evening, Hunter.
- Good evening. Follow me.
I hope you will be comfortable, miss.
- Thanks, Mr Hunter.
- I made sure you weren't over the wheel.
- It’s lovely, Hunter.
- Tea in the morning, Miss Webster?
- Yes, please.
- We get in at 6:31,
- we'll call you half an hour before.
- Thank you.
Very good, Miss Webster.
Thanks, Mr Hunter.
- It was clever of you to get a sleeper.
- Sir Robert told us, miss.
- Not so easy these days.
- We have our methods.
- This is my father, Hunter.
- How do you do?
Here is an itinerary I prepared
at Sir Robert's desire.
Would you be so good as to study it?
In Glasgow you change
to Buchanan Street station.
Mr McAllister, a director
of the Bellinger metal works,
will meet you on your arrival
at the Central.
You arrive at Oban in Argyllshire
at 11:31.
- Just leaving, sir.
- Oh, I must go! Excuse me!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Hunter.
Goodbye, Daddy, darling.
Send me a wire, I'll be back in a week!
- Goodbye, darling, God bless you.
- Goodbye, Hunter!
- Goodbye. My very best wishes.
- Don't forget to write.
And darling, don't worry about me,
I know where I’m going!
I know where I’m going
And I know who's going with me
I know who I love
But the dear knows who I’ll marry...

I do.
And do you,

'Next station Gretna Green.
'You're over the border now.'
Glasgow Central!
- Oh!
- There's a gentleman to meet you!
The stationmaster's with him.
- Miss Webster.
- Yes.
- I’m McAllister.
- How do you do?
- This is Mr Tinning.
- How do you do?
- It’s a grand day.
- It is.
You'll need all your time
to get to Buchanan Street.
Miss Webster?
I’m David MacBrayne's agent.
It’s a fine day.
- Miss Webster.
- How do you do, Captain?
I had a letter about you.
It is your first visit to the isle?
- Yes, it is.
- 'Tis a sublime day.
- Miss Webster?
- Yes?
Be getting in quickly out of the rain.
It’s a pity about the day.
An hour ago it was very pretty.
Ach, but it never stays fine for long here,
you will soon get used to it.
- Are you for Kiloran?
- Yes. Is it far to Port Erraig?
Quite a step if you walk,
41 minutes if you have a car
and you have a car.
Port Erraig is down yonder
behind the trees.
That is Moy Castle,
the ancient home of the MacLaines.
- Where do they live now?
- Down in Erraig House.
But they're dead now or in New Zealand.
There is only Catriona MacLaine.
- Is anyone allowed in the castle?
- Oh, yes, anybody can go in.
Except the Lairds of Kiloran,
there's a curse on them.
- What sort of curse?
- If they should ever cross the threshold
they say it's a terrible strong curse.
- (Shouts in Gaelic)
- (Shouts in Gaelic)
- I'd better go down.
- Will I take them for you?
- No, thank you, I can manage.
- I’ll wait.
Ruairidh Mhór may not be willing
to cross to Kiloran in this weather.
Oh, no, my fiancé's fetching me.
So the rich gentleman
in spectacles is your fiancé?
- Yes.
- (Speaks Gaelic)
- A thousand blessings on you both.
- Thank you.
But in a fog like the one coming up,
your fiancé won't see any better
with six pairs of spectacles!
- Goodbye!
- (Speaks Gaelic)
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Bad luck, no crossing today.
- Isn't that the boat from Kiloran?
- No.
And if she was it is not today
she'd be getting back.
That's the ferry boat. Pity you didn't keep
Iain's car, that's why I was shouting.
We didn't understand.
Why should I keep it?
To go back to Tobermory
and sleep there.
But I intend to spend the night
on Kiloran.
Would you like to wait at the house?
I know the people.
It’s been arranged for the boat to meet
me here and I’d better be here to meet it.
Good.
It’s the big house up the brae.
(Kiloran and Ruaridh speak Gaelic)
- Is that Gaelic you're talking?
- Yes, my lady.
What would it be but the Gaelic?
- What's that noise?
- That would be the seals singing.
The seals?
Yes, yes, they like the warm,
foggy weather.
If my boat doesn't come,
will you take me?
No, I will not, my lady.
'Port Erraig, 5:15pm.
'A motorboat from Kiloran
will meet Miss Webster...'
Good evening. I’m looking for the house.
You see a wee gate. Up the brae.
Thank you.
Hello?
May I be the first to welcome you
to these marble halls, young lady?
I was just going down to get you.
You've met the Colonel.
An exceptional pleasure.
Name's Barnstaple.
- The greatest hawk trainer...
- Falconer, my dear Torquil!
- Greatest falconer in the Western Isles.
- In the world, old boy!
Catriona's out. She's our hostess.
She's no idea you and I are here
but she'll find a corner for us.
She's a grand girl, bless her heart.
I’ve known her since we were kids,
she married an Englishman called Potts.
He's in the Middle East
and the kid's at boarding school.
- How's business, Colonel?
- I’ve got a new line now,
eagles.
I’ve been training a golden eagle
for seven months.
- Hunting with it like a hawk?
- Ha-ha! That's shaken you!
- Where is it? I’d like to see it.
- Sorry, old boy, lost him four days ago.
- Where did you see him last?
- On Gorrie's Leap.
I was trying with rabbits
and the blighter lost interest.
Sailed off up Beinn Teallach
and disappeared.
Every day I’m after him,
trodden that mountain
almost into the ground. But I’ll get him.
- Catriona!
- Here's the dear girl now.
Torquil!
(They speak Gaelic)
- Mrs Potts!
- (Speaks Gaelic)
Rum stuff is Gaelic.
Still got those half-starved hounds?
How do you manage to feed 'em?
We live off the country.
Rabbits, deer, stray hikers.
Do you expect me to eat them
just when the strain's getting known?
How's that for bone?
Look at that head, eh?
Torquil, it's good of you
to come and see an old bag like me.
- Good evening.
- This is a fellow traveller to Kiloran.
Oh, I see, Ruairidh wouldn't
take you over?
You're right but I love you just the same.
I came over on the midday bus
just to see you.
- This is Miss, erm...
- Webster.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Sorry I didn't see you, it's Torquil's fault.
- You'll stay here tonight.
- I don't want to be any trouble.
It’s no trouble at all. I haven't heard any
intelligent female nonsense for months.
Besides, there's nowhere else
you could go.
Don't worry, you won't have to sleep
on the floor, though the men will.
I suppose you noticed the place
was knocked about a bit.
Well, it did look a bit bleak.
Well, I’ve only just
got rid of the boys.
- What boys?
- The RAF of course.
I’ve had 'em for two years, 81 of 'em.
Won't they compensate you
for the damage?
Yes, they've been very fair about that.
Apart from trying to sell me
their concrete foundations.
No, they'll pay a lump sum
or do the place up as it was.
- After the war, of course.
- Which will you take?
That's the question, Torquil, my boy -
MacLaine versus Potts.
Up the MacLaines! (Speaks Gaelic)
(Speaks Gaelic)
- Will you have a dram?
- Certainly.
Help yourself. We'll get dinner.
Listen, you mongrel,
leave those rabbits alone!
We'll make a pie!
The Colonel says
you're a dead shot these days.
My dear Torquil, I have a tip for you.
After scrounging a few cartridges
out of a local controller,
find a sitting rabbit, take aim,
say to yourself, ‘If I don't shoot this
rabbit I don't eat,’ and you don't miss!
- And she doesn't.
- What's your other name?
Joan.
Mine's Catriona.
Can you skin a rabbit?
- Slàinte mhath.
- Bung-ho.
That's a queer girl.
What do you young chaps
know about girls?
- Not a thing.
- You know as much as I do.
Taming a woman must be worse
than taming an eagle.
Can't be done, old boy, it can't be done.
How's the war treated you?
- Not bad. Saw a bit of the world.
- Home much?
- Not for four years.
- Staying long?
- Eight days.
- Not much.
Mmm.
There's a right way and a wrong way to
skin a rabbit. I only know the wrong way.
Colonel, you're wanted.
On parade!
Tshhhh!
Hear any bells, either of you?
I thought for a moment
it was the old boy back again.
- Colonel!
- Right!
What did he think he heard?
His eagle.
Little odd, isn't he?
Who isn't?
Oh, it's Kiloran.
It looks huge.
Six inch to the mile.
As the wind gets up
it'll soon blow the fog away.
- Sounds as if it is.
- Are you staying long?
- Few days.
- Know anyone there?
- Mm-hm.
- It’s a fine island.
- I know.
- Been there before?
No, but I’ve heard all about it.
Do you know it well?
I’ve known it for 29 years.
I shouldn't have thought you that old.
Four years older.
Are you staying on the island?
I’ve got eight days' leave,
I want to spend it there.
Do you know Sir Robert Bellinger?
No, I’ve never met him.
Does he know you're going to Kiloran?
- No. Do you know him?
- Very well.
- Nice chap?
- The nicest.
- I’d like to meet him.
- You're bound to on such a small island.
- It’s not so small.
- I heard you could walk its length
in an hour and a half.
You can if you want but who wants to?
There are better things to do.
- Such as?
- Shoot grouse,
fish for salmon, bathe in Kiloran Bay,
picnic at Pig's Paradise.
- Where's that?
- On the north shore.
There's an eagle's eyrie
there on Beinn Bhreac.
- I promised to take the colonel.
- So he's going too?
- Yes, he's got a permit from Bellinger.
- So one does need a permit?
In wartime, for ordinary visitors, but I’m
staying with the factor on the west side.
Kiloran House is near the lake, isn't it?
The loch, yes.
Who is it?
It’s me. I’ve just been outside,
it's much clearer.
With luck we'll cross in the morning.
- Thanks for telling me.
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.
- Er, good night.
You can see the trees now. In half
an hour you'll be able to see the shore.
- In half an hour I shall be asleep.
- There's a grand view of Kiloran,
the northeast end. At sunrise the light
shines on the sands of Balnahard Bay.
With a glass you can see the people.
Have you got a match or a lighter?
Thanks.
Thank you.
- Are you engaged?
- Yes.
I’m going to be married on Kiloran.
It’s an honour for Kiloran.
Well, may your pulse beat
as your heart would wish.
- Thank you.
- Is it to be soon?
Tomorrow, weather permitting.
- Have you got any beams in your room?
- Yes. Why?
Count them now
and your wish'll come true.
- Easy as that?
- Only the first night under the roof.
People in modern houses don't know
what they're missing. Good night.
I warn you, it doesn't work
if you don't believe in it.
One, two, three, four, five.
Please, Lord, don't let the wind drop
and let it blow the fog away.
Good morning, Miss Webster!
Good morning!
Your counting beams certainly works.
Trouble is, you wished too hard.
- Why, what's the matter?
- We've had a gale warning.
- What will that mean?
- Ruairidh Mhór will tell you.
How long will the gale last? Och, just as
long as the wind blows, my lady.
It can last for a day,
it can blow for a week.
It looks so near.
In half an hour we could be there.
In less than a second you could get
from this world into the next.
- Can I speak to the island?
- By radio, from the coastguard post.
- Can civilians still use it, Ruairidh?
- Yes, yes.
- Where is the coastguard post?
- Tobermory.
- Can we get a car?
- We can go by bus.
Ruairidh, we'll be
at the Western Isles Hotel.
I think perhaps we'd better move there,
we're a strain on Catriona's household.
- Yes, of course.
- All right, then, breakfast?
- Oh, cheer up.
- Oh, I’m all right.
- Very difficult.
- Crazy!
It was a compromise - post office wanted
it up the hill, Catriona down below.
But why just here?
It was a dry summer,
they forgot that when it rains...
Hello?
It’s all right, you have a big room.
- What about you?
- Oh, I have a small one.
Now's my chance to see the castle.
I suppose you've been inside
hundreds of times.
- No.
- Haven't you really?
- Are you coming in now?
- No, I don't think so.
But you needn't be afraid of the curse.
What have you heard about that?
Well, I know that it's upon
the Lairds of Kiloran.
I don't know whether their wives
or future wives are involved
but I’ll risk it.
Coming?
I’d better introduce myself.
I am MacNeil of Kiloran.
And I am the Laird of Kiloran.
Sir Robert Bellinger has only rented it
for the duration.
I see.
There's not much difference,
it's his for the time being.
- Are you afraid?
- My father never entered Moy Castle,
nor did my grandfather or his father,
and nor will I.
How on earth can you stand it?
Aren't you curious?
No, it's always been like that.
Shall we go?
Excuse me, sir, are you not
MacNeil of Kiloran?
- Yes.
- (Speaks Gaelic)
I knew you when you were a boy,
Kiloran, and your father.
My wife is from the island,
from Riasg Buidhe - Katie Clark.
- Katie Clark?
- Mm-hm.
- Then you're John McAllister?
- Yes! You have your father's memory.
- Are you back for good, Kiloran?
- Only a week's leave.
- Och, dear.
- But it won't be long now.
I’m waiting for the boat.
How is everybody there?
Now, well, now.
They're fine, they're very fine.
My son was telling me
about the rich man on Kiloran,
him that is your tenant, Kiloran.
Like a little king, he is.
Yes, yes. My wife's second cousin,
Hector McAudram,
was working up there the entire spring
on a swimming pond he was building.
- A swimming pool?
- Oh, what foolishness!
And the whole wide open sea
to be swimming in!
- Aye, and the loch.
- Money spent is money earned.
Ach, yes, yes, my wife's second cousin
was not complaining!
Peat does not fall from an empty creel.
He has no care of money,
the rich man of Kiloran.
He brings salmon from the mainland
and the waters here are full of salmon.
Who is fishing for salmon on Kiloran?
Who would be
when there's no one to be buying?
So he would have to start buying
before anyone would start fishing.
(Man speaks Gaelic)
But can he no fish for himself?
No, he cannot, he has the finest tackle
from Glasgow
but the fish don't know him.
Yes, yes, the fish do not know him. No.
What are all the guns for?
Ach, we're losing lambs.
- There's an eagle been seen.
- Aye, a golden eagle.
Aye, and needs trail...
Since the nearer that
you've seen in this part.
Where was it seen?
Up in the yellow.
(speaking Gaelic)
- I could hardly wish them good hunting.
- Hardly.
- You didn't mind what they said?
- It was nonsense.
Why shouldn't one build a swimming
pool? I like swimming pools.
- It’s a matter of taste.
- Exactly.
I also prefer to call the fishmonger
if I want salmon instead of wading about
waiting for salmon to pass by.
- Really?
- Really.
The legend of Corryvreckan?
It’s the second biggest
whirlpool in Europe.
It lies northeast of Kiloran.
Corry means cauldron or whirlpool,
Vreckan was a prince of Norway.
He sought the daughter of the lord
of the isles and married her.
'Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, Polestar. Hello, Polestar.'
Go on.
The lord of the isles refused to give away
his daughter.
- Of course - he was a Scotsman.
- Except on one condition.
Prince Vreckan must anchor his galley in
Corryvreckan for three days and nights.
- What was the catch?
- That he thought he would be drowned.
It’s a terrible place.
When the tide's running, whirlpools form
and you can hear the roar for miles -
you can hear it from Kiloran.
I bet he anchored, though.
He went straight back to Norway.
There he asked the advice
of the old men.
They told him to take three anchor ropes,
one of hemp, one of... Wait a moment.
- Flax.
- Flax. Thank you, Mrs Beaton.
And you'll know well what the third rope
was made of.
The third rope was made of the hair of
maidens who are faithful to their lovers.
- (Mrs Beaton speaks Gaelic)
- Go on.
The maidens gave their tresses and
Prince Vreckan sailed for the Hebrides.
The first night, the hemp rope broke,
the second night,
Mrs Beaton's flax rope broke,
the third rope held fast.
- The third night...
- 'Hello, Tobermory. Hello, Tobermory.
'Isle of Kiloran speaking,
Isle of Kiloran speaking.
'Over to you. Over.'
Hello, Kiloran. Hello, Kiloran.
Tobermory speaking. Tobermory
speaking. Tobermory speaking.
Miss Webster's here to talk to
Sir Robert Bellinger. Stand by, please.
In there, my dear.
Hello, Robert.
Er, Joan speaking.
I’m here in Tobermory.
I had a very good journey.
Isn’t it a shame about the weather?
If you want Sir Robert to answer,
say ‘Over to you’.
Over to you.
'Hello, my dear. Robert speaking.
'I’m glad to hear your voice.
'We're all ready here.
Ready and waiting, worse luck.
'Cartier delivered the ring, I hope.
I hope you like it.
'l take it Hunter saw you off. Over.'
Of course, Robert.
Everything was lovely.
Is there anything the matter with your
voice? Have you caught a cold? Over.
'Hello. No, no, I haven't got a cold.
Do I sound as if I had?
'Listen, Joan, have you got a pencil?
Write down a telephone number. Ready?
'Two three six, two thirty-six. You got it?
'It’s the Robinson's number,
they've rented the castle at Sorne.
'Robinson's done a lot of work for me,
he's one of the best, so's his wife.
'They're the only people
worth knowing around here.
'They'll be glad to put you up.
'I’ll be over to fetch you
as soon as the gale blows out. Over.'
Hello, Robert, I’ve got the number
but I’d rather stay in a hotel.
You don't mind, do you? Over.
'All right, my treasure.
Do just as you like.
'l say, Joan, Major Foster,
MacNeil's factor's beside me
'waiting to talk to Mr MacNeil. Is he
there? I thought he was in the army.
'Over.'
Hello, Robert. He's here
and he's in the navy.
Well, goodbye, Robert.
I hope to see you tomorrow.
- Over.
- 'Cheerio, my pet.
'It'll be a quiet wedding.
'But full of surprises,
I promise you.
'Chin up! You can always ring 236.
'This gale can't blow forever. Goodbye!'
'Goodbye. Go ahead, Foster.'
'Foster speaking. Hello, Kiloran.
'Good to hear you're back,
even though you're stuck in Tobermory.
'Is there anything you want done? Over.'
Hello, Foster! Tell Duncan that I expect
the trout to jump into the creel
and the game to perch
on the end of your gun.
I read your reports,
I’m longing to talk things over.
- '(Speaks Gaelic)'
- 'Goodbye, Tobermory. Over.'
Goodbye, Kiloran. Goodbye, Kiloran.
- How much is that, Mrs Beaton?
- Ninepence each, Kiloran.
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, I can't change that, Miss Webster.
- Here you are, Mrs Beaton.
- I’ll pay you back at the hotel.
She wouldn't see a pound note
from one pensions day to another.
- People here are very poor, I suppose.
- No, they just haven't got money.
- It’s the same thing.
- Oh, no, it's something quite different.
- Any messages?
- No, Mr MacNeil.
Shall we go in?
- Mr MacNeil.
- Yes?
- I want to ask you something.
- Anything.
Do you mind if we sit at separate tables
at lunch?
You do understand, don't you?
Course I don't mind. We are strangers,
not even properly introduced.
Yes, but you understand
why I’m asking you?
You're the most proper lady
I’ve ever met.
I take that as a compliment.
Please, God...
Please, let the gale drop.
I must get over to the island tomorrow.
You know that I must.
It’s blowing great guns!
The wind's shifting all the time!
It’s gone from southwest to northwest
since daylight!
Where is it now? Blowing from every
point on the compass at once!
Ruairidh says that if it settles
in the northwest... But you know all that.
Poor beggar, I bet you're fed up
to the gills.
That's all right, I’m a patient man.
Now, listen, Colonel,
you're going to get into trouble.
Eh?
Blast the waterfall.
Speak up, there's a good chap!
What?
Big bird, my foot! It’s my eagle!
That's what I’m trying to tell you -
they're after it with shotguns.
Ignorant clods!
If they touch a feather
of old Torquil I’ll gore 'em!
I’ve christened him Torquil, you don't
mind, do you? He reminds me of you.
Oh, thanks. What?
As to this outrageous accusation,
I shall refute it!
If lambs are missing,
11-1 it's a fox or wildcat.
- I don't know anything about that.
- Every village bumpkin thinks
that eagles carry off schoolchildren,
bullocks, anything! Absolute poppycock!
Talk it over with Catriona,
don't do anything rash.
Hello, Peigi.
It’s an awful pretty day, Kiloran.
It is. Is Miss Webster about?
- She's away.
- Away? Where?
She was away in lain Joseph's car
before eight o'clock.
She went to Erraig.
Then she came back here, she used
the telephone, then she was away again.
The family will be down
in a moment, madam.
Hello! What are your names?
- Good morning, Miss Cheril.
- Who's she?
Miss Webster has called
to see Mrs Robinson.
Would you like anything, Miss Webster?
No, thank you.
- Are you Joan Webster?
- Yes.
You're going to marry
Sir Robert Bellinger, aren't you?
- Yes. Do you mind?
- I don't mind.
He's rich, isn't he?
Well, I haven't counted his money.
Are you rich?
No.
Madam, can I have the afternoon off?
Martin, no,
I’m playing bridge with Mrs Crozier.
- I see, madam, then that's quite all right.
- What do you mean?
I’d intended to spend the evening
at Achnacroish myself.
Has Mrs Crozier asked you
to make a four?
No, madam, I’m invited by Mr Campbell,
Mrs Crozier's head gardener,
to a ceilidh for his diamond wedding.
Diamond wedding?
Fancy being married for 61 years.
- If Mr Robinson doesn't mind, I don't.
- That's all right, Martin.
Adam! Surely you told me Robert was
having breakfast with us.
No, my dear, I said Robert's fiancée
was coming.
This is wonderful!
My dear, we're going to be such friends!
That man mumbled something
this morning.
If I’d known, I’d have been straight down!
What did Robert say your name was?
But you'll be Lady Bellinger soon.
Her name's Joan Webster.
Good morning, Cheril, darling!
You know everything!
If only we'd known you were stranded.
You've brought your luggage?
You'll have the blue
guest chamber open, Hooper.
- Really, I do think...
- Say no more.
I’m one of Robert's oldest friends
and you're to be his wife.
Let's have a look at you.
Oh, yes, you'll pass - with honours.
Oh, we need a fourth at bridge.
We are going to old Rebecca Crozier's
at Achnacroish.
- Do you play?
- No.
Oh, this generation! Cheril plays
but we're not quite in her class.
Says we play a stingy game,
don't you, Cheril?
Ooh, fairy stories at breakfast. Are you
coming with us to see Auntie Crozier?
- It depends.
- Now, that's too bad of you!
You promised. Daddy's a witness.
Well, how are you, my dears? Come in.
Rebecca, darling, you look wonderful!
Murdoch, will you go and light the lamp?
Sorry to have kept you all
standing in the wind.
Cheril.
- Who is this charming young lady?
- Joan Webster,
who's marrying Robert Bellinger.
- So I congratulate him.
- How do you do?
Put down your things, everybody.
Anywhere.
How on earth can you manage? Three
people in a house like Achnacroish.
- I always have guests.
- Oh, but they give so much work.
Not my guests.
Torquil, these are friends,
they've taken Sorne -
the English family Robinson.
- This is Joan Webster.
- How do you do, Miss Webster?
- How do you do?
- Hope you've got a long leave.
- Six more days.
- Well, it's far enough from the war here.
Plates, Torquil.
- Anything else, ma'am?
- No, thank you, Murdoch.
One, two, three, four, five
and half for the little one.
Torquil, this lady will be
the mistress of your house.
I hope you'll be very happy there.
- I’m sure I shall.
- Are you the owner of Kiloran?
Really! How interesting.
We nearly took Kiloran ourselves
but we found it just a little too expensive!
Your agent asked an enormous rent.
That's the only income I ever get
from Kiloran.
You see, for three years' rent
I can live there myself for six.
- Everybody saccharin?
- Rebecca.
Yes, please.
If I let my house I should never live
to enjoy the money.
You'll outlive us all! Achnacroish is
a breeding place for Methuselahs!
- Look at Campbell.
- Is that who's giving the ceilidh?
- Martin's invited.
- Campbell's diamond wedding.
- Quite a start on you, my dear.
- I’ll catch up.
- I shall put in an appearance later.
- But bridge first.
Yes, bridge first.
- Have you ever seen Highland dancing?
- No, never.
You ought to see our Oban gathering
in peacetime.
It’s not so big or famous
as Braemar or Inverness
but it has its own quality.
- You came through Oban?
- Yes, the harbour was wonderful,
and that lovely green island.
Imagine it full of yachts, big and small.
And there's racing
and Highland games all day.
And at night...at night they give a ball.
You can't imagine how wonderful it is.
The Assembly Rooms are all hung
with special hangings in dark red,
and the women wear tiaras,
those that have them,
and the place blazes with jewels.
The men - the men are more splendid
than the women.
With their velvet doublets
and scarlet waistcoats,
their lace cuffs and jabots,
their buttons of gold and silver,
their cairngorms,
their buckle shoes and their filibegs
of every shade and colour.
And the pipes play, and we dance,
we dance all night!
Till the sun shines through the curtains.
Lovely.
What does filibeg mean?
The kilt. Really the little kilt,
as worn nowadays.
Now, what about bridge?
Joan doesn't play.
- Do you play, Mr MacNeil.
- I’m sorry, no.
You'll see more from the ladder.
Could you go up further for the lady?
- The lady can have my place.
- Thanks.
Here you are.
- Better?
- Much.
One, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four.
Come on, Martin,
it's a schottische not a minuet.
Three pipers. They must have come over
from the mainland.
- Oh!
- Och, that was fine.
Could you dance the schottische?
- I think so.
- Good.
- I suppose we ought to go back.
- Oh, no hurry.
(Singing in Gaelic)
Friends and neighbours! A hundred
thousand blessings on my parents.
They are 61 years married this day.
Peace and happiness be with them,
the pride of the great clan Campbell.
The Campbells are comin', oho, oho!
The Campbells are comin', oho, oho!
The Campbells are comin'
to bonny Lochleven
The Campbells are comin', oho, oho!
The Campbells are comin', oho, oho!
The Campbells are comin', oho, oho!
The Campbells are comin'
to bonny Lochleven
The Campbells are comin', oho!
Speech! Speech!
- Come on, Mr Campbell.
- (Man shouts in Gaelic)
Well...
No, no, no, no.
(Woman singing in Gaelic)
How about we go outside
and have a little ceilidh on our own?
Och, Kenny!
- I went down to Erraig this morning.
- I know.
I went into Moy Castle.
Did you?
- Shall I tell you what it's like inside?
- Yes, please.
It’s just as you told me in the story.
I saw the hall where MacNeil feasted and
the dungeon in the thickness of the wall.
It’s awful.
And on the ramparts there's a stone...
- With a curse written on it.
- You've been inside.
No, but I was young once, I had a nanny.
- No.
- Mm-hm.
Anyway, I’ve read it.
It’s a terrible strong curse.
Terrible.
Now you know why MacNeil dreads
to enter the castle.
Careful.
Kenny, don't be silly, it's only you I love.
You do?
(Shouts in Gaelic) Come and get it!
- Scones?
- Aye!
Excuse me, is it not MacNeil of Kiloran?
- Yes, and you'll be a Campbell.
- John Campbell.
- I must tell Father you're here.
- No, you won't.
A MacNeil at the Campbells' ceilidh?
Hey!
(Sings drunkenly in Gaelic)
Just a minute! Later on, Hughie, later on!
Alistair! Ho Ro Mo Nighean
Donn Bhoidheach.
Ho ro mo nighean donn Bhoidheach...
That's a fine song.
Nut-brown Maiden. Do you know it?
Tune up, pipers!
It goes, ‘Ho ro, my nut-brown maiden,
‘Hi-ri, my nut-brown maiden.
‘Ho ro ro ro, maiden,
‘You're the maid for me.’
Kiloran! Is that yourself, sir?
Is this the way to treat an old friend
on the day of his diamond wedding?
We didn't want to intrude, Mr Campbell.
Here's length of good life
to you and Mrs Campbell.
Thank you indeed, Kiloran. Intrude, is it?
You and your lady must come and meet
Mrs Campbell and have a dram with us.
- Torquil, I must go.
- You can't go now,
it's going to be a grand ceilidh,
just grand!
It’s very good of you
but Kiloran knows I must get back.
- Kiloran knows nothing of the sort.
- You must see the dancing, my lady.
I saw perfectly well from here, thank you.
You've seen nothing yet, my lady.
We've got three pipers. Three of 'em!
They were ordered by the rich man
on Kiloran
but it's just my luck they couldn't get -
it was the gale stopped them.
Cheer up, they are your pipers.
How do you do, Mrs Campbell?
This is Miss Webster.
- Good night.
- Excuse me, miss. And you, sir.
May I be allowed to say that you were
the best dancers at the ceilidh?
Thank you, Martin.
'Please, please God.
'You know how important it is
for me to get to Kiloran.
'Please.
'Let the gale drop.
'Or let me get to the island somehow.
'Please.
'Please.'
(Speaks Gaelic)
- Morning, Bridie.
- Hello, Kiloran.
- Hello, Kenny.
- Good morning, Miss Webster.
- Wind's backing a bit.
- It’s not blowing near so hard.
Och, yes, tomorrow we'll be crossing
to Kiloran. Or maybe the day after.
- But not today?
- Himself is going to Tobermory
- to see the dentist.
- Tooth aching?
No, but there's no saying
when the next gale'll be.
- It’s only then himself has the time.
- Ah.
Saw you at the ceilidh.
How old are you, Bridie?
- I’ll be 17.
- You'll be marrying soon.
When the right man comes along.
- How old are you, Kenny?
- 18.
Getting on. Not thinking of taking a wife?
Oh, I’ll be called up soon.
But anyway, I’d have to wait
another three or four years, or more.
- Why's that, Kenny?
- Takes money to marry.
- How much?
- 20 pounds.
- Himself wants that for the boat.
- Who's himself?
- Ruairidh Mhór.
- Father.
He'd give you a share
as a wedding present.
(Speaks Gaelic)
When Kenny can buy half, he'll get
the other half for nothing right enough.
Good day to you, my lady.
Good day to you, Kiloran.
- I wish it was.
- Och, it will be.
Yes, yes, yes, it will be.
Och, yes, indeed, it will be.
Yes, yes, it will be. I am not saying
that it is not blowing as much as it was
but it is near the end of it.
Indeed, it is just like the sun, my lady -
it seems always biggest
just before it sets.
- You're a poet, Ruairidh.
- Can we cross today?
No, no, no, my lady, no.
Well, will you stand by in case it drops?
I’ll pay you for your time, of course.
You said yourself it might blow down.
It’s very important, I must get across.
I’ll pay you anything you ask.
I will take you to Kiloran as soon as
it is humanly possible, my lady,
and I will not be wanting
extra payment for that.
We'll be up at the house.
And I will be in Tobermory.
Fine doings indeed.
That girl is so foolish,
she is a woman already.
- Who is it?
- The islanders.
Oh, stay for lunch. Curried rabbit,
the Colonel's doing it. Hello, Joan.
Hello.
Hello.
- Torquil.
- Yes?
Would you do me a very great favour?
Yes.
Will you help me to get to Kiloran?
If I had a fair-sized boat but I haven't,
not even a small one.
But Ruairidh would listen to you.
If you asked him he'd try to get me there.
- Besides, you're wasting your leave.
- I don't mind.
Yes, you do, you love Kiloran,
you haven't been for years.
I don't mind.
- You won't ask him?
- No.
It’s his job to take us across,
his duty if you like.
If he could he would.
Can't you wait till tomorrow?
I can't ask him to risk his life, or yours.
He's been out in a gale often enough,
the ship was in danger.
It’s different when people are in danger
and need help.
- Yes, but I...
- What?
I want help desperately.
Dressing gong!
- Do you think it'll blow out tonight?
- No.
- Do you think there'll be a lull?
- Unlikely.
Great news! Congratulate me -
Torquil the eagle is found.
His name's cleared, it's a fox
that's killing lambs, a shepherd saw it.
The old boy's safe and sound
up on Gorrie's Leap.
I’m off up there after lunch with a lure.
By Gad, I hope I get him back.
- You coming?
- I’d like to.
What about you?
We'll be back by tea time.
I think I’ll stay here.
Any sign
of your godson, Torquil?
No.
But I can see something else.
So that's it.
There ought to be a law about trees.
You know, Torquil...
Potty.
Please, ma'am, I’d like to be speaking
to Miss Webster.
- Bridie wants to speak to you.
- What is it?
It’s about the boat, miss. Don't be taking
it out, miss, himself'll murder Kenny.
Nonsense, I’ll look after your father.
Anyway, Kenny's taken out
the boat alone many times.
But never in a gale,
never in a sou'westerly gale.
But it's blowing out. Your father said
it's going down all the time.
- Himself would never take it out.
- What about the money Kenny will earn?
You want to have to wait
another four years to marry him?
Well, I would, then, if it has to be.
Some folks there are who can't be
waiting a day to satisfy their passions.
- What are you saying?
- Some folks there are
who want to drown young men
and break girls' hearts
so they can be bedded one day sooner!
- You'd better get out!
- I’ll be getting out when I please.
Who are you to be giving orders?
You that come with your airs and graces
and your heart of stone.
Why should you think our lives don't
matter and that yours is so important?
But you don't understand.
Bridie, don't cry.
Do you think I’d risk Kenny's life when
I could be safe here? But I’m not safe.
I could lose everything I’ve ever wanted
ever since I could want anything.
What do you think you're doing?
I’m off to taking Miss Webster to Kiloran.
You're off to losing Ruairidh's boat
and drowning. Don't be a fool, Kenny!
- How much did she pay you?
- 20 pounds.
- Now who's the fool?
- I’ll make it up to you.
Come on, boy, give her back
her dirty money.
Och, Kiloran, I can't do it, I promised!
She made me promise
and that's the truth of it.
- Oh, Kiloran.
- Where's Miss Webster?
She's in the flat.
Please, don't let her be taking Kenny!
- Go on, say something.
- I will.
Are you a complete fool? Well?
How dare you speak to me like that?
You think you know better
than folk who've always lived here?
Ruairidh said it was going down,
so did Kenny.
- What do you expect? You bought him!
- There's no need to shout at me!
Why, the lad has never seen
20 pounds in his life!
If you must commit suicide,
can't you do it in Manchester?
Don't shout at me! You're insulting!
- Stop bothering about me.
- What about Kenny?
- What about him?
- What about Bridie
or the lifeboat crew that'll go out,
and their families?
- You think I’m wasting time over you?
- I’m not interested in your reasons.
I am not...
Are you interested in anything
but yourself?
I know how to mind my own business!
That won't carry you far
on this island or on Kiloran.
You can have this island! And Kiloran!
Fine! Then you won't be in any hurry
to get there.
You can't think you know more
about these waters than Ruairidh.
Do you think he refused?
Because he's as stubborn as you?
Because he wanted to go to the dentist!
Oh, go ahead, then!
And drown yourself!
- You heard, I suppose.
- They heard you in Tobermory.
- Torquil.
- Mm-hm?
- They'll never make it.
- What do you expect me to do?
Lock her up?
She'd only jump out the window.
She doesn't realise the danger.
And you're the last person to stop her.
l?
She's running away from you.
Say that again.
Hold on there!
Give me that case.
(Prays in Gaelic)
Are you the praying type?
- Sometimes. Are you?
- Always.
If we can stay on our course
and right side up we've got a chance.
Aren't we on our course?
Every mile nearer Kiloran
we're two miles nearer Scarba.
- Is that dangerous?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Corryvreckan.
The whirlpool.
You never finished the story
about the Norwegian prince.
What happened to the third rope
made from the hair of faithful maidens?
It held until the tide turned.
Nothing is stronger than true love.
No, nothing.
- Feeling sick?
- Oh, no.
No, I’m all right. Go on.
But one maiden was untrue to her lover,
only one,
and when that strand broke,
the whole rope broke with it.
Kiloran!
Get down under the hood and hang on!
Don't worry about that! Get under!
Look out!
Hang on!
Ohh! My dress!
Don't mess about! Bail!
This is the way to bail!
Engine's washed out,
I’ve got to take it apart.
- What can I do?
- Keep bailing!
And praying!
Keep it up.
Clean that.
Corryvreckan.
Get the cover.
Hurry up.
If I can get us started before
the tide turns, we've got a dog's chance.
Tide's still with us. We'll do it yet.
Now, pray.
Your credit must be good in heaven.
They know a good prayer
when they hear one.
(Speaks Gaelic)
(Speaks Gaelic)
(Bridie speaks Gaelic)
So, you're back.
(Speaks Gaelic)
Big, strong man.
Off in bed.
There's a fire in my room
and that's where you'll sleep.
My very dear chap, you've missed
the experience of a lifetime.
- Have I?
- You have.
A new chapter's been written
in the history of falconry.
- Oh, you've got him back.
- Ah, listen to this.
He came to the lure like a lamb.
Like a hawk, I mean.
The gillie suggested a hunt
for the fox that killed the lambs,
so we went up off the Teallach.
And by Gad, we found the fox
and by Jimmy Christmas, he caught it.
- Caught it, who?
- Torquil!
Torquil the fox hunter! Stooped
at the blighter as though it was a rabbit.
Killed him stone dead. Here he is.
Dog fox. 21 pounds, if he's an ounce.
I’m gonna have
the brush mounted for you.
- Now, what have you got to say?
- Where is he?
There! Over the door!
Isn’t he a pippin?
Torquil! Come on.
Wah! Loo-loo-loo-loo-loo!
Tally aye!
Woop, get onto him!
You must think I’m awful.
I don't think anyone's awful.
Not even when I’m breaking my neck
to marry a rich man?
- Oh, what's wrong with that?
- I thought you didn't care about money.
Who says so?
I’d swim to Oban for ten pounds.
Glasgow for 21.
And what about Torquil?
He'd do it for 15.
Oh.
But I thought that you
and Rebecca Crozier and Torquil
were perfectly happy without money.
What else can we do?
Well, you could sell Erraig
and Rebecca could sell Achnacroish.
and Torquil could sell Kiloran.
Yes.
But money isn't everything.
Now go to sleep.
Thank you.
Good night, Catriona.
And if you count the beams,
your prayers'll come true.
I’m not praying tonight.
Now, Torquil, onto your perch.
That's it.
Torquil! You greedy swine.
Here, get...get off.
I can't do anything with my hair.
Wonder what happened
to my wedding dress.
A mermaid will marry in it.
- How's Kenny?
- Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.
He's helping Ruairidh with the boat.
- And who's for Kiloran?
- Not the colonel, he's got his eagle back.
Not Kiloran.
The only passengers I can see
are you and three pipers.
Is the boat coming?
Yes, it's coming.
I’d better go down and meet him.
Always the little lady,
doing the right thing.
- I’m sorry, I can't change myself.
- You're all right as you are.
Bye-bye, Mrs Potts, I’m for the bus.
Goodbye, Catriona,
and thank you for everything.
Will you do something for me?
It depends.
I don't care where or when
but somewhere, sometime,
will you have the pipers play
Ho Ro, My Nut-Brown Maiden?
It might be done.
Will you do something for me,
before I go away?
It depends.
I want you to kiss me.
‘Now, Mr Torquil,
I’ve told you a thousand times.
‘Once upon a time,
hundreds of years ago,
‘MacNeil of Kiloran
took a beautiful wife from the mainland
‘But she was in love
with a cousin of hers,
‘a MacLaine who held Moy Castle.
‘After a year and a day,
‘when her husband was away,
ravaging the mainland,
‘she escaped from Kiloran and took
refuge in Moy Castle with her lover.
‘One black night, Kiloran came.
‘He besieged and took the castle
‘and killed every soul,
except the two lovers.
‘There's a deep dungeon,
just off the banqueting hall.
‘It’s a well with nine feet of water in it
‘and a rounded stone,
‘just big enough for a man to stand on
‘or drown.
‘Kiloran tricked the two lovers,
chained them together
‘and threw them into the dungeon.
‘He sat in the great hall,
‘feasted and mocked them while
they held one another above the water
‘till their strength failed
and they dragged one another down.
‘Before she died,
the woman cursed Kiloran
‘and every future MacNeil of Kiloran,
‘if they should ever cross
the threshold of the castle.
‘There's the curse,
carved in stone on the ramparts,
‘there, to this day.
‘It’s a terrible strong curse
‘It goes:
‘'This is the curse
of Catriona MacLaine of Erraig
‘'My curse on MacNeil of Kiloran
and every MacNeil after him.
‘'If he shall ever cross
the threshold of Moy,
‘'never shall he leave it a free man.’'
- Hoi!
- Hoi!
- I was lying to you.
- Oh.
I’d rather swim in the sea
than in a swimming pool.
- I know.
- I’d rather catch salmon in my stream
- if somebody'd teach me how.
- I know.
And I’d rather go to Kiloran in Ruairidh
Mhór's boat after the hell I’ve raised.
I was lying to you, too.
I’m not really afraid of this place.
I know.
‘Never shall
he leave it a free man.
‘He shall be chained to a woman
to the end of his days
‘and he shall die in his chains.’
I know where I’m going
And I know who's going with me
I know who I love
But the dear knows who I’ll marry
I have stockings of silk
Shoes of fine green leather
Combs to buckle my hair
A ring for every finger
Some says he's black
But I say he's bonny
The fairest of them all
My handsome, winsome Johnny
I know where I’m going
And I know who's going with me
I know who I love
But the dear knows who I’ll marry
