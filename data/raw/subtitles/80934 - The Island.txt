Hey, it's right.
What do you think it is?
Oh, you got a fish on there.
I know it's a fish, but what--
- Let the line out, come on.
- Hey, stop this.
Push this button here.
Don't push that.
Keep your hands off the line.
Bring him in,
keep him coming, all right.
I think you got something.
Hey, congratulations.
- You got a big M.
- M?
- Hey, got a marlin.
- No, that's a kingfish.
- Congratulations.
- It's your fish.
- It looks like a Marlin to me.
- That's a king.
Bring him in.
It's coming,
just keep that coming like that.
Take it easy, Captain.
- Yeah, let's get him.
- Keep it coming keep it coming.
Okay, stop the reel now.
What are you-- bring him in.
[instructions coming fast]
Push the red button,
stop the reel.
- Push it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Ahh.
Hey, what happened to him?
There's something
got hungry down there.
I did my part.
That's a damn shame.
What the hell is that?
A French liner went aground
about nine years ago.
- Broke it's back.
- Lord, how'd that happen?
Too much faith, I guess.
- Faith?
Yeah, captain probably
believed his charts.
That's fatal out here--
islands here that aren 't meant to be.
Vice versa.
Where are we going now?
Captain figures we can anchor here
for the night, I guess.
- It's still a trophy.
- Well, it's half a trophy.
Well, at least we got
to fly the tuna flag.
Yeah, but it's not a tuna.
Still looks like a marlin to me.
You know, that's a damn shame.
We could have had it stuffed
and mounted.
- A record.
- Record.
Yeah, smallest marlin ever caught.
Now there's a record!
Look at the size
of that bloodsucker.
Boy, bring us
some bug spray out here.
Decent wire man
would have brought him in.
It's like surgery--
You don't send a proctologist
to do a nose job.
Yeah, then you'd look
like a real asshole.
Man wants to know
if we have any bug spray.
Tell him to take a hike.
Bug spray isn't included
in the price of this cruise.
[radio] I'm talking about Jesus.
Hey, will you turn down
that goddamn radio.
Not Mickey Mouse,
not Donald Duck--
Put any TP in the head today?
Yeah, yeah, and there's an extra roll
underneath your bunk.
All right, thanks.
That's easier said than done.
- Are you seasick again?
- This kid must own a vermouth farm.
That's one martini I can't drink.
- It's a ranch.
- No, it's a factory.
- Ranch.
- No vermouth is made
just like wine from grapes.
They take it to someplace
and depress it in a factory, right?
Nolan, what the hell is that?
Ranch.
They have the regular places
right on the ranch.
No, it's those little
white seeds, isn't it?
Those are gin berries, Irv.
Vermouth is like a wine.
Oh, oh, there goes
the captain's paint job.
What's up?
Looks like a canoe or something.
- I can row a boat.
- There's a canvas on it.
Wonder what's underneath it.
- There's a canoe under it.
- I'm going to get the gaff.
Let me have that.
When did you start drinking gin?
About seven years ago.
That's the head of a snail.
That's a weird looking thing.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What do I need with it?
Come on, you guys,
give me a hand.
That's just disgusting like that.
Maybe we could sell it
to a museum for an antique.
Hey, that's a joke, folks,
where's the laugh?
If that's your prize marlin,
I'm going to give up fishing forever.
Is it dead?
Cadaver's always dead, Doctor.
Wait a minute,
there's a hand there.
Yeah, boy, that stinks.
Shit! Ahh!
[yelling]
Hi, Charlie.
Hi, Jim.
[knock]
Later.
You'll go blind.
You're my mother,
I'm not even nearsighted.
The boat disappearance cover,
you wanted a hard news peg
to hang it on.
Day before yesterday--
no survivors, no wreckage, nothing.
Page 16 of the news.
Not no exactly what I call government
material-- who cares?
Who cares?
Two thousand people have died.
Fifty thousand
die in cars every year.
Acumen, who uses words
like acumen?
Ask him, he wrote it.
What is it with you limeys?
Why do have to use ten dollar words
for two-bit thoughts?
Acumen.
Come on, let me go down to Florida.
See what's going on.
Bermuda Triangle bullshit--
who needs the garbage?
Six hundred boats vanish
in three years.
Now, I didn't make that up.
That's Coast Guard figures.
Use the Miami bureau.
They wouldn't give New York
a time a day.
Now, come on, let me go down
there this afternoon.
- Go, go, go to Miami.
- Thank you.
That accent--
they won't understand you.
Kiss my acumen.
- Hey.
- It wasn't my idea.
Aren't you supposed
to be at school?
Friday's always half day.
Oh, sure.
Sure.
I told her I could spend
the weekend at Jimmy's.
Told who,
what are you talking about?
Mom didn't call?
No.
Beautiful.
What was she calling about?
She and Richard went to Dallas--
some business meeting.
Richard?
Ah.
How long you been reading that?
This is a good article.
Yeah, there are some good pieces
in there, huh?
I guess you want to see Jimmy
for the weekend, huh?
It's too late, he's gone
to his grandma's.
Ah, well, I guess that means
you're stuck with me.
Anything in particular
you'd like to do?
Yeah, I'd really like to go
to the Metropolitan Museum of Crap.
What about the Orlando Museum
of Famous Ducks and Mice?
Huh? Florida.
Unless I am wrong,
Disney World's in Florida.
You pulling my chain?
We'll see.
What are we gonna see first?
I hear Space Mountain's
really outrageous.
Uh, Yeah, yeah.
But, uh, um, first,
I gotta see a couple of people
at Fort Lauderdale.
This isn't another double cross, is it?
What double cross?
Last summer, the camping trip.
Just you and me, right?
You think I wasn't sorry for that?
Your mother had a chance
to take you to Mexico.
I mean, camping,
we can do that anytime.
Yeah, but we don't, do we?
You promised.
Look, gun shop.
- Yeah.
- Let's stop.
What for?
To look.
Please?
Okay.
James Bond gun--
Walther PPK.
Dirty Harry gun--
.44 Magnum.
Poo!
Kill an elephant.
How come you know so much?
Sometimes I go up to Gramp's house
and shoot his guns.
Wow.
What do we got here?
I think I spy a gun person.
Name's Baxter, call me Bax.
Hi.
Say, son, what's
your favorite firearm?
Colt Frontier, a .44,
Gramps has one.
Really outrageous weapon.
Firearm, son, not weapon.
Always remember, son,
a firearm isn't a weapon
until someone makes it one.
Guns don't kill people,
people kill people.
Right on.
Uh, that .44 is a real stopper.
- Stopper?
- Yeah, you gotta knock 'em down.
A man can do you a pile
of damage before he dies.
Say, son, we have
a .22 demo over here.
Would you like to squeeze off a few?
No obligation, of course.
Ah.
- Piney, let me have some--
- Live targets.
Back here you'll find
a little peace and quiet.
[Bax] Good, darn good!
See, that time you squeezed.
Darn good.
Perfect.
Bull's-eye.
Blew that sucker away.
Darn good.
Care to give it a try?
Yeah.
You're pretty handy.
What?
You're pretty handy.
Yeah, I was in Korea.
I guess you never lose it, huh?
You know, your boy
could be a competitor.
- Oh?
- Yeah, most kids flinch.
The hand and the eye
don't work together.
His eye commands his hand.
Well, that's, uh, great.
But I'm afraid we have
to be moving along.
- Justin.
- Wait a second.
Uh, do you sell by mail?
To a licensed dealer.
Gramps knows one, doesn't he?
Maybe I'll ask my grandfather
to order the .22 for me.
But, then again...
Unless you'd like to save
him some trouble, Dad.
How 'bout it, Dad?
Give grandpop a break.
He wasn't such a bad guy.
Yeah.
Next, they'll have t-shirts
for funerals.
Poo!
Poo! Poo! Poo! Poo!
Justin, will you stop that?
It's not loaded.
Sure, guns are never loaded
'til they go off
and blow a hole
in someone's head.
What would you do then, eh?
Say, "I'm sorry about that?"
It's not cool or outrageous,
you know.
I know, I'm sorry.
Sure.
"I'm sorry, mam, I was playing
with Jimmy and I shot him.
But, never mind,
you can have another kid."
Okay, I hear you.
Your mother's going
to have my ass.
I won't tell if you don't.
[laughs]
[woman] Oh, you're ready to go?
They're gonna go,
I want to take the first watch.
Who are you going to watch?
Very funny, you saw the wreck
over there didn't you?
That doesn't mean somebody
should come along.
- Thanks for dinner.
- Oh, you're welcome.
I'm going to take the first watch,
the second watch is yours.
Please set your alarm,
I don't want to do this all night.
Oh, I have every confidence.
[giggles]
Watch where you're going.
Watch?
I am watching, I'm steering.
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.
Mort, more to the left.
My left or yours?
What are you doing?
You stand at watch,
you stand at watch.
God, I'm tired.
Ah, salt air will do it every time.
[creaking]
[creaking continues]
[lamp clanks]
[sighs]
[creaking]
Mama?
[recorded man #1] When it comes to
why a boat disappeared, everybody lies.
[recorded man #2]
Why, what for?
Insurance companies won't
pay off for hijacking.
So you plead ignorance or swear
your boat sank in a storm.
- But why don't you just--
- Who do you go to, the FBI, customs?
Only if you can prove
there was smuggling.
Only if you can prove there was
a federal crime.
If you're looking to charter
the Lady, forget it.
Yeah, I heard.
You want to fish,
I'll take you fishing.
Nice, clean boat,
hundred and a half, half day.
Beer and soft drinks included.
Justin,
come on.
Hundred even,
that's the best I can do.
If I'm going to pay a hundred bucks
for a piece of fish,
I want a tablecloth and a glass
of white wine.
Hey, I'll do the same thing for $75
and throw in a bottle
of white wine, how's that?
Uh, drug runners
could be hijacking 'em.
You know, they hang around the docks,
just sweet as innocent babes.
You take them on and you
wake up dead one night.
Then they use your boat
to run a load of junk
from Columbia
and then they scuttle it.
Now, that part of the world's shitty.
Always has been, always will be.
Uh, there are two more, you know.
No, I didn't know.
Two more?
Yeah, sailboats headin' for Haiti.
Plane searched for four hours.
Where did they call from last?
- - Coming UP"
Disney World's not open
all night, you know.
Coming up on Navidad.
Same general area
as most of the others.
How do I get there?
I knew you'd double cross me.
Give it a chance, Justin.
It may be better than Disney World.
Sure.
Well, what do you think?
The son of a bitch
has propellers.
It's a cargo plane.
Something for show and tell
Monday morning.
Dad.
- Mr. Maynard?
- Yeah.
I'm Stark.
Hi.
Hop aboard.
Okay.
[grunting]
Pay her no mind,
she'll pass out in a minute.
Have to give them knockout shots,
otherwise they go berserk.
Stan'd have half a ton of shit
and loose in the air.
Step inside a minute, boy.
In the right hand seat,
kid, I got job for you.
[thump]
It is no fun in an airplane
with a 400 pound sow
gone apeshit.
[engines start up]
Wear this 'til we get off the ground.
Tower got to believe
we got two pilots-- the law.
Tried to put it on the pig one time--
bitch bit me.
Will you help me with this?
Sometimes these islands
all look alike from up here.
Don't you know where it is?
Sure, trouble is just a little
too much cloud cover and it isn't.
You ever been to Africa?
Where do I start looking?
Caribbean's down here.
Navidad's in the Atlantic,
but way out here.
No decent airports,
no Holiday Inns.
Yes, sir, you are headin'
for the asshole of the western world.
You mind if I ask why?
That's Navidad.
What's up his ass?
Wrecks of doggies.
Screw it.
Still there.
Up you, Charlie.
- What's the red light mean?
- What?
Red light.
It means the wheels are up.
Slide back!
Now hold tight.
We're going to do a little jig.
Unfasten your seat belt!
Come on.
Quick.
Run, Justin, Run!
Hurry!
Come on!
Tanks are going to blow!
Get down.
[second explosion]
You asshole!
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?
Not only did you nearly kill
the two of us,
you left my boy and me
on the plane!
Don't blame me, I told you
these damn things aren't made to fly.
Well, what the bloody hell
are you flying it for?
- Dad?
- What?
Further more, Mr. Maynard,
I did you a favor
by bringing you on this plane.
- I'll wrap it in the coat
- No.
Insurance companies say they cannot
take passengers on the plane.
[whispers] What about at customs?
I'm just a kid.
We'll get it through
the customs like this.
- Exactly.
- Okay.
Maynard?
I'm gonna tell.
Who caused this wreckage?
Hydraulic failure-- no sweat.
Insurance company'll pay
for the cleanup.
Oh, yeah?
Probably all moving weed.
Now listen here,
I'm a reporter from New York--
Shut up, I'll say when I want
to hear your bullshit!
[bugs buzzing]
Don't forget to tell your mother
you went to Disney World.
Young man,
what's your name?
Justin Maynard.
How old are you?
I'll be 13 in November.
May I have my wallet please.
[officer] You wait outside.
What are you doing?
Insurance company's
going fix up my airport--
Yes, sure they are!
But firm broke.
Until it get fixed tomorrow
and I get my guarantee,
you gonna stay right here.
Aw, come on Wescott,
what is this?
What guarantee?
The insurance company's going
to fix the thing.
Wescott?
Wescott?
I get my money soon, I bet ya.
[Stark] Wescott, I'll make you a deal.
Wescott, I told you the insurance
company's going to pay you off.
[Stark keeps yelling-]
Is there a plane out tonight?
Never at night.
No landing lights.
Maybe tomorrow, maybe at Monday.
[Stark] I got something on that boy!
Come here a minute, now!
Wescott?
He's running guns, man.
You?
Man, he already goofy, eh?
Hey, pay no worry on him.
Most folks survive one night.
Is there any place we could stay?
Chain Place.
Chain Place?
It's a hotel.
How do we get there?
Up the road.
Thank you.
Hold it!
That will be 20 bucks.
What for?
Landing fee.
[Maynard] This must be it.
Ahh, it's going to be more fun
than some tacky hotel.
There we are.
Camping out, after all.
I know you're thinking
double cross, right?
But how many dads
give their kids an air crash.
Huh?
Justin?
[Maynard] Hey, how'd you like
to catch a barracuda?
[Justin] What makes you think
we can catch a barracuda?
Well, it's better than waiting
for a broken phone to ring.
Stupid goddamn thing.
You didn't really have to bring it.
Yeah, suppose the maid found it?
Did you put the bullets in
or did you leave them?
Put the bullets in.
Some of these islands,
they put you in the slammer
for being in possession
of just one single bullet.
Am I going to miss any school?
[laughs]
Some.
Enough to make
your mother crazy.
I'm the one
that has to live with her.
Yeah, I'm the one
that has to deal with her.
Stay there, Justin,
I'll try and rent one of those.
- Try to get the Mako.
- Okay.
[man] Be gone, you Ethiopian.
Dr. Windsor,
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Anything I do alone
is imminently interruptible.
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.
The hotel said you rent boats.
I'm Blair Maynard.
I know, I know,
from the plane that crashed.
A carat of excitement amid the din
of tedium that is our lives.
You're a reporter.
- You know?
- The drums tell all.
Ow!
A boat disappears every three
or four days for three years.
Wouldn't you call that substance?
As you will.
But you'll find no answers here.
Drums tell you that too?
[knocking]
Be gone, Paul Drew, me closed
for the month of Ramadan.
Is my dad in there?
That's my son.
Yes, I knew that too.
Well, well, who have we here?
Come in, come in.
Oh, you're a fine looking lad.
How old are you?
Now let me guess-- fifteen?
- Twelve.
- Twelve.
Great Scott,
you'll be a champion.
Lex Luthor.
My boy?
It's like Lex Luthor's place.
You know, the brainy guy
who's always out to get Superman.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
HEY-
It's a musket ball.
Mold marks--
damn thing's homemade.
Where'd you get it?
It was in a piece of wood.
A musket ball?
Oh, nothing extraordinary.
These islands stink of history.
They've given refuge
to all sorts of scallywags--
pirates, privateers, buccaneers.
You never know
what the see'll cough up.
Yeah.
Come on, Justin.
Let's see what else there is.
What about the fishing?
The good doctor
doesn't trust us.
No, no, no, perhaps I was hasty.
I'd hate to deprive a boy
of a fishing trip with his, uh, dad.
Well, you want
to go fishing, do you?
What's that?
Show me.
Oh, wretched things.
Does it hurt?
No, it tickles.
[chuckles]
Vinegar!
Come with me, young man.
[Windsor] What sort of fish
do you want to catch?
[Justin] What sort you got?
Mm, kingfish,
wahoo, barracuda.
Barracuda?
So be it.
I haven't even had a bite yet.
Give it time.
There's blue water out there.
That's where the big ones are.
[line zips]
He)', YOU got one.
Oh, that's great, Justin,
hang on, hang on.
Don't give it any slack.
Slowly, pull it in slowly.
Pull slack back.
Don't leave any slack.
Back, back, back--
Don't leave slack.
Don't try and take it from him,
just give it to him.
Just snap it
if you give him slack.
Okay, pull back, back, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
Hey, hey, bring him to the side.
I'm gonna hit him with this.
Bring him to the side,
I'll pull him out.
Don't bring him up,
don't bring him up.
Keep him down,
keep him down.
- Bring him around.
- Hey, what are you going to do?
There he is.
What did you do that for?
They got to be unconscious
before you bring them into the boat.
You get one
of these alive on board,
they really could be trouble.
What is it?
What did you want?
A barracuda.
[whispers] That's what you got.
- Really?
- A barracuda.
About nine or ten pounds,
two and a half feet.
Outrageous.
Look at those teeth.
Mm. [laughs]
Pity we lost the camera
on the plane.
Could a taken a picture
for your mother.
Tell her it was in a pond
at Disney World.
Right.
Let's get back.
Why?
Well, it's gettin' a bit late.
You said we could spend
the whole day fishing.
Well, we have.
Let's catch another fish.
We got one.
This one may spoil
by the time we get back.
It won't spoil, you can stuff it--
oh, okay, okay.
Okay, let's give it another try.
Let's get it going.
You knew right where
that barracuda'd be.
Well, I have to admit,
I did have a little help.
Remember, the doctor did say
they'd be out here.
I bet you caught a bigger fish
than that lots of times.
Come on, tell the truth.
Nope.
That is bigger than anything
I've ever caught.
- Really?
- Really.
Next time, we'll get a big boat.
We'll go after monsters.
[Maynard] Let's go further east.
Look out there.
Is that someone in the water?
He must have fallen overboard.
Are you all right?
[Maynard] Yeah, he's alive,
look he's waving.
He's waving.
Why the hell did he leave
the life raft?
[Maynard] Yeah, he's okay, look.
Is it-- is it a guy?
No, it's a girl.
It is.
Justin, get in the stern,
it'll be easier.
[Maynard] Hang in there, sweetheart.
We'll be right with you.
[Maynard] You okay?
Give me your hand.
[Maynard yells instructions]
[Maynard] Tie it on the rope.
[engine stalls]
- [Justin] Dad!
- Be right there.
Don't panic, Justin.
[man] All persons having business
before His Majesty's Justices
of Eyre and Terminad
and general jail deliveries
[group voices]
be upstanding.
[whistle blows]
[man #2] Silence in this court.
He is up, Sire.
[Nau] Who is the party
for the first part?
[man] That party going to a party.
[Nau] Who the witness?
[man] The girl.
[Nau] The held.
Wait!
Give him water.
You must never kill
a thirsty man.
Dad?
Dad?
Is so written
in the Covenant!
[men mumble]
His Honor.
Holy Jesus, hold our hand
as we approach the promised land.
Hold personal
to wrong from right
as we chase
your eternal light.
We proceed.
For the prostecution,
[man] the Honorable Dr. Brazil.
[cheers]
For the defense,
Honorable Jack the Bat.
Guilty, not guilty?
[whispers]
I, I don't--
- Did you did it or you don't?
- I, I don't--
Don't say self-defense.
I defend.
You do-do-did,
or you do-do-did not notta?
Not, no, no.
How can I defend a lie?
The witness.
[horn blares]
What you saw?
What else what you saw?
What also else what you saw?
Defense object.
Why?
Defense always object.
I charge murder.
Witness don't deny.
Come on, darling.
What do you say?
Who are you?
- What the hell is this?
- Silence!
You don't ask, only answer.
Not question Lullenwar.
What's a-- what's a Lullenwar?
Leader of this land
since reign of Second Charles.
Shh.
Shh.
I'm John David Nau.
Who are you?
Uh,
Blair Maynard.
Again.
Blair Maynard.
[whispers]
Maynard Puelo.
This man is Maynard.
His grandpere killed great teach
called Blackbeard.
[men whisper]
What's he talking about,
Blackbeard?
I'm scared, Dad.
So am I.
Don't let them see it.
- A fine boy.
- Yes, yes, yes.
Maybe they won.
Aye.
The boy good blood.
[Nau] Fetch the woman.
First the boy.
A time for vida,
a time for muerta.
Live the life,
make the passage.
Died your death.
Have you for supper.
- No, Dad, no!
- Goddamn it, no!
Come.
[man] No, let him hang.
Where's he taking my son?
No son, no more.
He's not going to hurt him?
Hurt him.
[woman] Bastard!
This man,
he killed a woman's man.
The Covenant say
she fix his fate.
Woold him.
His eyes pop out, I eat them--
Woold him!
Covenant say,
"Can't woold a noble man."
He die with no eyes.
He not see God.
He not see God,
he have no communion.
It is written.
Legalistically sentence be death
by the widow's own hand.
Covenant say,
”Have no man,
have no ninos.”
Must be puta.
If he die, you a whore.
Noble man make noble baby.
Noble make good fig-fig?
Fig-fig?
[Nau] Now, time for the vote.
For death?
Now I count the vote.
If he die, she a whore.
Who pays to thrust with her?
You, puta need hombre.
Fine fig-fig make fine baby.
You like beast with two backs,
not enough meek.
This beast has two backs.
Are you ready?
My Lord.
[labored breathing]
[breathing calms]
[slurps]
Agua?
Okay.
No.
Please, just go to sleep.
Mm, by and by
Your name?
Justin.
No, no good.
New name, nom de guerre.
Like old days.
Must ring with great deeds.
Maynard--
Two Barb.
Aye, Two Barb.
What Say?
Two Barb.
Please, sleep.
But you said.
No past.
No future.
Only what I tell you now.
Mother dead, father dead.
Now say after me--
No mother.
No father.
[man] For what we are
about to receive,
may the Lord
make us truly thankful.
[laughs] Bon appetite.
I never--
never, you're not eating,
you're not eating.
They're meant for healing stuff.
There you go, my boy
Come on, get in there.
Aw, you're thoughtful.
You are Two Barb.
Enough three days?
So good beginning.
He's strong.
He wants to be led.
He must be hard like flint.
Segurra.
To kill his father.
He must be cold, swift.
Segurra.
Two'll get it.
The Covenant say,
"If a child would lead,
he can have no sorry,
no shame."
He kill his father,
he kill the past.
Two will do it.

Eat.
Hungry hombre make bad thrust.
Look after your pet.
What that?
Listen, how long do you intend
to keep me here?
Quiet!
You thrust, no talk.
You know nothing--

Woosted work.
But the man must be alone.
Use the lock.
Now, work like a woman.
[Nau] Stay vigilant.
[man] Always, solemn one.
Who are you?
I mean, all of you?
Are you some kind
of religious cult or something?
Eh?

You kill my man.
Ah, now, I can explai-- ow!

He came on board my boat
while I was fishing
and he attacked me,

Make good baby.
He made bad baby.

I told you

Too bad.

[man #2] Come on, get some speed
or we'll be here all day.
Is there a drop at 50 yards?
You aim true, she fire true.
Take your time, take your time.
You aim true,
she always fire true.
Put the lad to the test.
This for you.
Entroop, fetch the water.
Yes, me Lord,

[laughs]
The gun is called le terrible.
Stand right here.
You know how to stand still?
Uh-huh.
Now is good time.
[cheers and chattering]
I'm okay.
Of course.
Huh?
If I'd wanted to hit you
I could have hit you.
Ah.
How they, uh, treatin' you?
You look fine.
We got to roll with it.
Stall for time,
do anything they say.
They're searching for us,
I promise you.
Your mom, magazine,
Windsor, the guy
we rented the boat from.
We can't be more
than ten miles from Navidad.
It's just a matter a time.
Did you find out anything
about these turkeys?
I know they want us
to think they're pirates--
- Buccaneers.
- Okay, buccaneers.
Let's not split hairs,
have you learned anything?
You make me sick.
[whispers]
What?
How dare you speak
to your father like that.
You're not my father.
I am Two Barb because my ancestor
killed Blackbeard.
Stop this make-believe!
That was another Maynard
and you--
Liar!
[whispers]
Come.
Blown away like pollen.
Aye, we're learning.
[thunderclap]
I'll need some help with this--
too heavy.
Come on, you were gonna

Man, pig!

Pig-
[man] Hey, woman, come on.
So damp this woman down.
' [man] Sag.
- [woman] Pig,
[Click]
[man] And provide more prizes.
First, Lullenwar found this land
in 1608.
Needed refuge
from Spanish enemies.
God gave him this island.
High times for free princes.
Prizes everywhere,
riches for the taking.
Later, God give him a son
to become the second Lullenwar.
God keep the line flourish.
Higher they flourish.
[balloon roars]
Ahh!
[yells]
Ahh!
[coughs, groans]
[men's voices]
- [man] Something moving.
- [man #2] My torch go out.
[man] There's something moving
over there.
- Here they are.
- They're here.
She got him down.
I think we should kill them.
If she goes, so does he.
Send them both to their mission.
If he escape, everybody die.
In toto.
He rotten bilge,
we shoulda kill him long ago.
Yeah, cut both their throats.
Throw them in the sea.
The boy.
Aye, get on with it.
Hey, puta, where the chain?
No chain, no escape.
He come to wash,
no see the stingers.
No, she lies, she lies,
she's letting him go!
She lies!
[men yelling]
God say, "Forgive."
One time.
Then cut it off.
It is a written.
If he escape, many soul
follow you to hell!
Wait!
[chuckles]
A lesson, huh?
No, believe me.
I telled the truth.
No!
Lift her skirt!
[woman screams]
[man] Enough!
[men chatter and hoot]
[Nau] Leave them be.
They go nowhere.
puta
[groans]
[sawing]
Hold that
Dig it out.
With this?
No escape.
Mine, don't touch.
Bastard!
[whispers] Windsor, Windsor,
get back in the boat.
Dr. Windsor?
Dr. Windsor?
- What in the devil are you doing--
- Keep your voice down.
We're both in terrible danger.
The island is crawling
with pirates.
- Pirates?
- Shh.
I know it sounds crazy,
but you better believe me.
I'll explain later.
Take these handcuffs off and we'll
get back in the boat, quickly.
I thought you were going
to kill him?
She's let him go again.
[horn sounds]
[people chattering]
...one laden making its way
from the southwest
doing about seven knots...
[horn sounds]
[clamoring]
- [woman whistles]
- You're pretty chipper
for someone who's just
been bashed around.
I don't have a mind.
Doctor bring good news.
Good news for who?
Me, he tell of big ship,
big prize.
- Have to bag.
- What bag?
For booty.
Booty.
[yelling and chattering]
Hurry.
Thank you, doctor.
Hold him for me.
Hello, doggie, come in.
Sit down, Fido.
[doctor laughs]
Let's drink, you drink.
You need fire in the belly.
Or they accompany you?
Woman has to pay for the prize.
She lost her man.
The Maynard.
He must see how Two Barb
has become a man.
[doctor] Are you wise enough
to feel privileged?
You and I are the only living men
ever to see what you see now.
A bunch of assholes playing
Long John Fucking Silver?
Hardly, dear boy--
living history.
An anthropologist's dream.
You're witnessing the 17th century.
Yeah?
A nest of jerk-offs
who can't face the 20th?
Open your mind, lad.
These are the world's great survivors.
For 300 years they've avoided
the garbage of civilization.
Young man 's forbearer,
the first Lullenwar,
was history's primal warrior.
He became his enemy.
Used to tear out a man's heart
and eat it before his dimming eyes.
Terrific.
If only you had the brain.
What other father can die
knowing his son will mature
into a true, pure, natural man--
a classical buccaneer.
They'll come looking for us.
[chuckles] Let them.
In the Bahamas alone,
there are more than 1,200 islands.
They could search
'til the apocalypse.
No one would bother.
[man] The Lord is my shepherd.
[doctor] I've already
reported you lost at sea.
- You're lying.
- Perhaps.
Perhaps not.
But if you hope
for a fortuitous turn of fate, don't.
No planes fly over here.
Can 't you see it's like a--
a medical culture,
specimen of the past,
a laboratory true and pristine.
There's no corruption-- no boats,
no planes, no picnickers.
And that's why you must die.
To keep things as they were,
as they are,
and as they ever shall be.
But you're the lucky one
because in your son--
Why do they need my son?
Why don't they use
their own kids?
Mm, would that they could--
there are none.
Apart from your, um, lady friend,
the only women here are inbred--
scrofulous disease.
If one of them got pregnant,
the child would probably die.
If it lived,
it would surely be an idiot.
Yeah, I can see that.
It was my inspiration
to infuse them with new blood.
Think about it!
Your blood will carry the line
for the next 300 years.
[men cheer]
[cheering, yelling]
[coughs]
Drink!
Hearts are gonna be hungry,
gonna slit throats.
Huh.
It's a ripe day to die.
You ready to die?
You made your peace?
Kiss my ass.
Not even drunk.
Schooner.
Look, my son.
Fine, robust bitch.
Hey, Robie, check this out.
What is it?
Whatever you're selling,
we're not buying.
Wave them off.
- Tell them to get away.
- Wave them off.
Fire.
Tiller!
Hey, what is this,
Hollywood celebrity?
[gunshot]
AWW!
Aw!
Choo!
Stinking dog!
Kill you.
Son of a bitch.
[howls]
Now I kill him for sure.
[howls]
No!
[clamoring]
No, no.
Hoo, hoo.
Be Still.
Peter Lenaise.
[howls]
[rumbling]
Come on out.
Far out, man.
Now, you come with me.
Filthy bastard.
[woman screams]
[screams]
Just about the noisy cow.
Ha ha.
Hey, wait.
Oh, she's good--
strong, child-bearing hips.
Huh, a good strong back.
Let me see your teeth, my darling.
She good breeding stock.
We should keep her.
Let the company decide.
What that?
It's a-- it's a drug called cocaine.
What does it cure?
Insecurity.
Fetch the fire.
Fire?
Oh, you mean matches.
A time for vida.
A time for muerta.
Live the life.
Make the passage.
Die the death
and you shall earn redemption.
Having served in the lake
which burneth
with fire and brimstone.
Revulsions
21:8.
Brenda!
[scream and laughing]
What the law of the Lord
of brimstone lick of cheeks.
You bad sinners,
salvation can be yours
if you will come to Jesus.
Time to vote.
[Nau] How say you
for this prisoner?
- [clamoring]
- [loud shot]
For this prisoner?
[shouts]
[loud shot]
Is this prisoner guilty?
All guilty.
[loud shots]
[clamoring and cheering]
Hey, hey-
He climbing up to heaven.
[laughs] I help him on his way.
Please, don't shoot.
Two Barb, my son.
Boom boom.
Hey, don't!
Don't come near.
He has the falling sickness.
A severe case of the dropsy.
He did a good job.
Sorry for that piece of meat.
No...
I'm sorry for Justin.
Justin?
I am Two Barb.
[cheering]
Take the chain.
- [Nau] Mr. Rasmussen?
- We're coming out.
- Good.
- Aye.
Sail out.
Send it to heaven.
Send it to hell.
[man] May she all rest in hell.
[animal cries]
[indistinct chatter]
[horn beeps]
- [woman] Doctor?
- [doctor] Hmm?
Watch him.
Certainly, by all means.
Well...
What have we here?
[toy beeps, plays notes]
[doctor chuckles]
Your boy.
He has greatness.
Knew it the first time I saw him.
Yeah, he'll make a great assassin.
Oh assassin-- butcher, savage,
utter rubbish.
You're a moralizing fool.
If they're so randomly vicious,
why didn't they do me in
when I stumbled on them
30 years ago, hmm?
Because I convinced them
I could help them.
And yourself,
why do you still draw a breath?
Is there something irresistible
about your kiddie?
Seriously?
Why do you think
they've kept you alive?
- It was the woman who kept me alive.
- Oh, is that so?
It's your virility
that's kept you alive, is it?
Your life saving thruster!
Do you believe that?
You silly ass.
Oh, oh.
I believe these are yours.
I found them on my boat.
Mm.
Hello, What have we here?
A flare pistol, hmm.
[doctor] How exotic.
Ahh.
Mmm.
I think I might have that.
[doctor] Sweet dreams.
[laughs]
No time for regrets.
Just happy memories.
Who's this for?
You.
Oh.
What's the occasion?
They know now.
You don't think
you're pregnant now, do you?
They told me.
- Who did?
- The doctor.
Dr. Brazil say I am with child.
Take these off,
I'll swim for it.
Come on.
[drunken chatter]
[doctor] ...and if you want to deal...
[man] Well, look at this.
Wed us.
[laughing]
Do you...
Blair Maynard.
Blair Maynard, take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?
And do you, Beth, take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?
Yes.
I now pronounce you
man and wife.
'Til death do you part.
Enough, proceed.
Covenant read, sir.
[Nau] Once I had a son.
But he died.
I told to take
this one for my son,
but he Portuguean Zambo.
So this noble one
I take for my son.
Father.
Time for vida.
Time for muerta.
[whispers]
Drinkin.
I know.
Take the drinkin.
The blood of our ancestors.
I can't.
Never tell me no!
[crowd laughs]
A man must drink.
I did that to show them
that you are a man.
[man] Steady, steady,
and uh, steady.
[man #2] The prisoner is leaving.
[man #3] How the fuck
do you know that?
A d-down and d-down
and d-down it goes.
[doctor] The condemned man
makes a limp flower.
I don't listen to pig, them bay.
Bay? In the middle of the night?
- Manuel, what the hell is going--
- Shh.
Why are you helping me?
I'm not helping you,
I'm helping myself.
Just take your son with you.
[man] Where he be?
Inside.
Where else?
Why do you ask?
I left him there.
[man] Not inside.
Where then?
You let him go.
No, I visit the pit.
Ask Vaska.
I'll take you away, Justin.
Everything's going to be--
Father! Father! Father!
Hurry!
One last chance.
Where he be?
Finish her now, kill her,
finish her!
- No, I tell the truth, I promise.
- Father! Father! Father!
[man] After him!
Once outside cove, go east.
- East is not the ocean.
- I'm right-- safety.
That's the open ocean.
Wrong-- Shh, trust me.
In the boat, he got saved.
He's only here a second.
Did you see anything?
Not yet.
[man] He nowhere.
We waste our time.
[gurgling]
Molasses.
Plugged with molasses.
You son of a bitch, Manuel.
What be to jetsam to starboard?
Aye aye, something like that.
There.
[man] The dinghy?
[man #2] It's his boat.
[man #3] Search on,
Lullenwar will want the body.
[man] Drowned, drowned,
he's dead.
[doctor] Well, where is he?
He drownded for certain.
You saw him?
No, doctor, we search all time.
Outsail you, did he, Rollo?
Eh.
Some fine seaman you are.
Go stick your face up
dead goat's ass.
He's not drowned.
Where then?
He's 'round here somewhere.
You've got his child.
You must find him and kill him.
- He drowned at sea, he's dead!
- Let's set fire to the island!
I will hunt.
May I lead the hunt?
[blows whistle]
[Justin] Maybe he's in the water.
[man] He try swimming.
He be no fool again.
We'll find him.
Follow me.
What they doing, fishing?
[doctor] Gathering something.
Right there on the water.
[man] There sure is
a lot of this stuff.
Well, I can check with a little bit
of beach combing.
No, no.
[men 's voices]
I'll, um, I'll go and talk to them.
- Say nothing.
- No, no, of course not.
I'll, uh, I'll just take a look.
Ahh!
[mixed voices]
[buzzer sounds]
I beat you to it.
Gance?
Go ahead.
[radio] As long as you're out there,
check that explosion out right now.
Well, what do you want me to do
with all this coke?
You sure it's cocaine?
[telephone] Sure, I'm sure.
There's enough here to jazz
the whole East Coast.
Plane must have gone down.
Well what do you want me to do
with all this stuff?
I don't know,
dig up eight dollars
an ounce, okay?
Look at that, Gance.
There's an opening
down there in the rocks.
Whoa.
Gance, stay in the boat.
Whatever you say.
Sweet dreams, Gance.
[clamoring]
[screams]
[snap sound]
What took you so long?
Bring these to me at hill tide.
I use the boys for the surprise.
You'll be the trickster, my son.
Little boy all alone.
[Nau] Find the Maynard man.
Cut his throat.
Wait for the horn
and come with the others.
Been all the way
around the island.
There's only one place left
for him to be.
He's down here.
You get 'round that side
and you go 'round that side
and kill him!
[Nau] I want him and hurry up!
I don't want to miss all the fun
in the battleship!
Oh, wow, this stuff's awful.
Hey, get this out of here, will you?
Probably Carl using
the latrine these days anyway.
Do you want me to ask?
Nah, just get me another cup--
black this time, all right?
[men chattering]
...this snake show so many times.
[man] Captain, er, I was wondering
if you could take a look
back by the nets?
There's something back there
just doesn't seem right.
I'd really like to have you
take a look at it.
[man] That's Gance down there--
it looks like he just crapped himself.
There 's something underneath
that tarp 's bottom.
We better go have a look.
[man] What the hell's going on
over here?
[man #2] Beats the shit out of me.
Hey, Gance, what's the matter?
You seasick or something?
I'll bet Crall flashed the natives
and they cut his dick off.
Baske, you see this?
Gance down there, Sir.
Bodies under those tarps?
Looks like he's
under the influence, Sir.
- Fire!
- Ahh!
[alarm sounds]
He's high, damn it, for alarms.
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
[indistinct response from radio]
You guys wouldn't believe
what the fuck's happ--
[horn sounds]
[clamoring]
A toast to a great,
great victory.
Well done.
We took many losses.
Losses, how many?
Gwiner went.
And Basko.
And Habana.
Habana?
[man] Come up here,
come up here and unload it.
[man] Careful with that last one.
[clunks]
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
As you lived,
so shall you live
in the hereafter.
Now and forever more.
Oh.
Death is adventure.
The last great adventure.
He passes from this life
to the glory of the next.
We commend
our dearly beloved brother
into the eternal deep.
- Amen.
- [men] Amen.
Grief not, we'll see him again in hell.
[men cheer]
[man] What a prize!
[clamoring]
Hey, HEY!
[sighs]
My son.
Kill him.
Shoot him, my son,
and you'll know true freedom.
I can't.
I can do it.
[gun fires]
Come... with me.
Come.

I'm on final approach.
I have Nautilus in sight.
Roger-- request advise

Oh, my God.
Comstay Portsmouth 1377,
there appears to have been some sort
of a fight or some sort of casualties.
There appear to be some
Coast Guard casualties.
The rest are, uh-- the best I can
describe is some type of civilians.
- Roger.
- There appear to be pirates-- over.
P-- Pi-- Pirates, Pirates-- over.
Did I read you correctly?
Did you say pilots or pirates?-- over.
Um, I said pirates, pirates.
I'm not kidding,
they appear to be pirates.
They're dressed as pirates-- over.
Uh, 1377 Comstay Portsmouth.
Pirates, you mean like,

Roger-- we're hovering
around the ship now.
I can't get...
