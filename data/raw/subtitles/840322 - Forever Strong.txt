[ Whistle blows ]
Yeah, nice! Way to hustle!
Good job. Good job.
Highland Rugby, One, Two
ALL:
One, Two!
Beniamin, Adam,

-Way to stick with it.
-How did you miss that?!
What are you guys doing?
Get it together!
Okay, Roundy.
Let's go! Let's go!
Hustle, hustle!
Get back in there.
Let's go!
A little rough on his kid, huh?
-What the heck was that, huh?
-Go!
That's rugby, man.
-What?
-You.. .
-Oh, no!
-He spit in his face.
Let's go!
Come on, guys, let's go!
-Oh, no way, man! Come on!
-You're out of the game.
Forget it!
Forget it, man!
Dude, it's not worth it!
Come on!
We'll have to take a blood sub.
l'm not sitting.
No. Sub him out.
Wait, wait, wait!
Way to go, Ricky.
That's your best hit of the day.
Let's go!
No blood. l'm ready.
We're good, yeah?
He stays?
-He's good.
-Okay. Let's go.
[ Whistle blows ]
[ Crowd cheers ]
Come on! Come on!
[ Whistle blows ]
Way to be Highland!
[ Whistle blows ]
Hey, Coach?
Nice game.
Played a good game, guys.
And great kicks today.
They're idiots.
They won.
[ Other team chanting ]
Great game.
Tough loss?
They didn't lose.
They rolled over and died.
They gave up,
like scared little girls.
-No offense, son.
-We tried.
What do you mean you tried?
You try, you sit.
This is about doing.
Coach!
Yeah.
[ Scoffs ] Tried.
Your dad iust wants you to win, hon.
He wants to win.
That has nothing to do with me.
[ Loud rap music ]
[ Cheering ]
Hey!
Hey, Rick!
[ Screams ]
Oh! Oh!
Oh, they are way too drunk
to be in the water.
Somebody get them some wings.
Okay. All right.
So anyway, it gets better,
because this coconut has iust got
it hanging there on his face, right?
And this guy is huge, all right?
Like Yeti big. He's big.
So, he wipes it.
Wipes it off with his hand.
He wipes this loogie off
with his hand.
And licks it.
And l swear
it's thick enough to chew.
-Oh, Mark, that's disgusting!
-Sick. l'm gonna barf.
Yeah, well...
All right!
Listen up!
Hey! Listen to my mouth!
We present this oh-so-delectable
trophy to the guy
who's gonna take us back
to nationals next year, baby.
Yeah!
[ Cheering ]
And, and!
Sh, sh, sh!
And a complete massacre
of Highland!
[ Cheering ]
Rick, what are you doing?
Yeah! Whoo!
Come on, baby!
-l don't think l'm this drunk.
-Yes, you are!
Yeah-hoo!

JUDGE: Natalie Penning, do you have
anything further to offer this court?
He's better than he seems
on paper, Your Honor.
l iust hope you can see that.
Does the young man's father
have anything to add?
He was unable to attend.
Then, we'll proceed.
You may be seated.
Thank you, Your Honor.
JUDGE:
Richard Seymour Penning, Jr.
He prefers Rick, Your Honor.
Counselor,
considering this young man's
drunk-driving career,
he is fresh out
of what he prefers.
Do we understand?
Yes, Your Honor.
Stand up.
JUDGE: Mr. Penning,
this is your second D.U.l.
You have now
compounded that travesty
by seriously iniuring
a passenger.
Had this happened when you
were 1 8, you would be in prison.
So, effective immediately,
you are a ward of this Court.
l have therefore determined
that you will be transported
and placed in the Wasatch County
Juvenile Detention Center
in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Prior to your 1 8th birthday
there will be a review to determine
whether you will be placed
on probation
or transferred
to an adult correctional facility
until such time
as this Court deems you
no longer a danger
to yourself and society.
Nice to meet you, Rick.
l'm Marcus Tate,
Administrator here at Wasatch.
You can call me King Tate,
Sir Mark, Marcus,
whatever you like.
Where's my stuff, Marcus?
Why, l had the bellhop
take it to your suite.
lmportant.
This is Bingham,
my right hand at Wasatch.
Hey, haole.
You'll be dealing mostly
with Bingham, myself,
a couple of interns --
anyone else? No. That's about it.
l'll show you the rooms.
Here you go.
No doors.
No secrets.
lt's a part of ''Listen Right.''
Well, l'll let you get settled.
Dinner's in a half hour.
[ Laughter ]
Oh! No spinning!
l said no spinning from the beginning.
MEWS: .. .the front-running flyers
ripped the Sabres, 1 43.
.. .Dan Quinn scored three times,
helping the Penguins
throttle the Jets 8-3.
The Leafs throttled.. .
l iust want to say hi.
And, uh...
l just wanted to see
how you're doing.
[ Sighs J
l'm sorry.
[ Sighs J
l miss you.
Bye.
[ Receiver clicks ]
[ Laughter ]
l'm telling you, let's iack him.
Nah, he's too much
of a pretty boy for jacking.
A guy like you,
what would you say?
Oxy? Vics? Percs?
Or maybe he's iust in here
for his own protection.
Hey, we all say
why we're in here, man.
Ernesto here,
stealing Girl Scout cookies.
Me, for beating up Ernesto.
You?
For being a pretty boy?
Hey, get off him, punk!
Come on!
Are you gonna yell at me or what?
Shh. Just listen.
Deep down.
Was it right?
What?
Hey, it wasn't me.
Those freaks started it.
You offended the home.
This is retarded.
You iust offended the home again,
not to mention me.
Okay, l'm sorry.
Are you and the home happy now?
Almost.
About 1 O minutes. Lights out.
Better hurry up.
You take forever.
Now, l want you guys to take notes.
l'm talking about something
really serious.
l need you guys to pay
attention, yeah? Okay?
[ Chattering ]
[ Laughter ]
You want me to say
l love it here.
fine.
Great. l love it. It's...
l really don't even think
l want to leave.
l want you to be honest, Rick.
You want me to be honest?
l hate it.
Every day
for the last six months.
l deserve it.
l know that.
l didn't say that.
ls Dad there?
Hey.
He wants to talk to you.
l thought he'd be home by now.
RICK:
Don't worry. l get it.
Merry Christmas, Mom.
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
Go, go, go, go!
Hey, Penning!
You too pretty to play?
Come on. We need you on ''d.''
We'll play touch if you want.
-He won't play.
-Come and play with us.
He's afraid of messing up
his pretty face.
l only play rugby.
All right. Listen up.
We usually play with 1 5 sides,
7 backs, 8 forwards.
But we're iust gonna have to
make do with what we got here.
All right. All you guys
in blue shirts on my left.
All the guys in the gray shirts
on my right.
Line up about 2 feet apart.
You, back up about 5 yards.
You're gonna throw the ball in.
Now, if you get tackled
and you go down,
you must release the ball
back to one of your own guys.
Then he takes it and goes.
We don't stop. There's
no huddles, no time-outs.
So it's kind of like
football and soccer.
lt's kind of like rugby.
You always have to pass the ball
sideways or back, like this.
-Nice catch.
-You just keep going
until you score, the ball
goes out, or someone dies.
Man, this is iust
a bad rip-off of football.
Actually, Americans
ripped off rugby,
then they added
sissy pads and helmets.
Whatever.
You're going down either way.
Yeah. We'll see.
Throw it in
over your head like this.
Actually, you know what?
You should back up about 5 or 6 feet.
All right. You guys ready?
Down for the count, son!
He's down for the count!
1 07 days, Darren.
Oh, come on.
You can get through it, man.
COACH: Don't need to teach you
the same thing every day.
RICK: Sounds like
he's in a good mood.
COACH: Better!
Well, you better get back here
in time for nationals, buddy.
Man, my dad's
not gonna let me play.
Oh, come on. He wants to win.
He'll play you.
Hey, l'm sending
something your way
that l think
might cheer you up.
Hey, brah.
Marcus is waiting, yo.
l'm still on the phone.
Dude, they check my mail.
-l know that. l'm not an idiot.
-You're not?
Aloha 'Oe.
Marcus is waiting.
Hey, man, what's
so important that--?
Rick Penning,
this is Kurt, ''Q '' and Tumo.
l know you love rugby, and l know
you've heard of Highland.
They started their practices
a week ago,
-so l thought--
-Oh. You thought wrong.
-As usual.
-Yeah. Well, we win.
Yeah. We beat you.
You can come and find out how.
l already know how.
You cheat.
Man, you don't know anything.
Seriously.
Well, then, you can come find out
how we cheat.
-How about that?
-Not interested.
What's up, dude?
Back up, man!
We both know
that you've done all you can
to avoid learning anything
while you've been here.
The upside is we've got the cleanest
bathrooms that we've ever had.
All you've wanted to do
since being here
is go back to Arizona
the same kid.
So?
[ Sighs ] So if going home
is all you're about,
you ought to know that the iudge
can reduce your time here
based on my evaluation.
Sometime check out
the back of your closet.
252.
l carved one of those a day
when l was 16.
l didn't always have my head
screwed on straight.
Rick, most of what we do here
l learned playing rugby
from Coach Gelwix.
l owe that man my life.
l wanted Kurt and the other players
to talk to you for a reason.
How much sooner?
l don't know.
Maybe before the end
of rugby season.
[ Hawaiian music plays ]
[ Hawaiian music plays ]
Belt up, brah.
l'm not your ''bra'',
so quit calling me that.
Okay, okay. No problem.
Belt up...
.. .sister.
Ain't hardly no worries. l get paid
by the hour, not the mile.
Holoholo!
[ Whistle blows ]
Let's get them going!
Knees up! Pick it up!
Let's have a good practice!
Let's do it! Focus!
[ Whistle blows ]
[ Whistle blows ]
Up! Up! There you go!
Keep it going! Nice!
G E LWIX:
Rick Penning?
lt's important for you
to know right up front,
if you spend a whole lot of time
in the gym, you work your hardest
with a complete commitment
to do your best,
you eat smart, get enough sleep,
and you work your tail off,
and someday...
someday you can
have a body like mine.
Glad you're here. It'd be great
to teach you how to play rugby.
l already know how to play rugby.
Oh, yeah? Okay. We'll see.
You're gonna be late.
Come on.
-Good iob, Root!
-Come on!
-Get 'em up! Get 'em up!
-Keep 'em high! Keep 'em high!
Griggsie!
You're late!
Let's go, guys!
Let's see it higher, higher, higher!
There you go!
Addison, four corner!
Let's go!
[ Whistle Blows ]
All right, guys!
Hey, come on! Go!
There you go. Good.
Pop it! Come on, pop it!
Yeah, keep it going!
Five! Down for five! Let's go!
Good iob, rookie!
Thataway!
Let's go! Come on!
Randy out, Penning in.
Make 'em work, guys!
Rugby passes!
Rugby passes! Let's go!
[ Whistle blows ]
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
-Oh!
-Down for five!
Take a left! Take a left!
Right, right, right!
Go left! Go left!
That's all right. But one day
you'll learn how to go left. Yeah?
There you go, Farley!
[ Whistle blows at intervals ]
Hey, man, shouldn't he
be down here coaching?
He been doing the coaching, brah.
Go, go, go, go!
[ Telephone rings J
ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, you've reached the Pennings.
We can't get to the phone --
ALL:
One, two, one, two.. .
[ Whistle blows ]
[ Whistle blows ]
All right, guys.
Bring it in. Let's go!
Keep it going!
Bounce those feet off the turf
like it means something to you!
Knees up! Knees up!
Our season starts in three days
with New Haven.
We ready?
ALL: Yes, Coach!
Coach Gelwix asked me
to offer up a reminder.
Do we drink?
ALL: No, Coach!
COACH: Do we smoke or use drugs?
ALL: No, Coach!
And with the girls, do you keep
yourselves clean and out of trouble?
ALL: Yes, Coach!
You got to give your word
to yourself
and to your brothers
on the team.
What are you laughing at?
Coach, how are you gonna know
if we drink or get with the honeys?
Because you'd tell
Coach Gelwix yourself.
Do we cheat? Do we lie?
ALL: No, Coach!
We got to have complete trust
in each other.
You lie, you burn the bridge.
Any player who lies or cheats
is gone for the season.
The only lies allowed
at Highland Rugby, gentlemen,
are by me about my rugby career.
[ Laughter ]
Who are we?
ALL: Highland Rugby!
Till the death.
All right, guys, take a knee.
Randy.
Thanks, Coach.
-Phipp.
-Coach.
Opetich.
We're about winning gentlemen,
and not just in rugby.
And for that reason,
you will obtain a laserlike focus
on and off the field.
That means discipline
over every part of your life.
So, if you want easy, go play lacrosse
or football or join the Marines.
Welcome, gentlemen,
to Highland Rugby.
Coach!
Gladly. Hit the field, boys.
Let's go!
-Positions! Let's go!
-Let's go! Let's go!
Don't be lazy!
Let's not be lazy!
[ Growls ]
[ Hip-hop music plays ]
They're like freaking choir boys.
Yeah, l know they are, Rick,
but you got to open your eyes.
Yeah. You're in the inner sanctum.
No, man. Unh-unh.
l am done.
Early out's not even worth it.
You know, you're not there
to just suck up some judge.
Get over yourself.
You're there to glom their secrets
and find out how they win.
They run everyone to death.
That's how they win.
Okay, so what?
-Gina, chill, would you?
-Get off the phone.
You, uh, get a little present yet?
lt should make you happy.
Yeah, it's cool, man.
Thanks.
Did you see Tam's message?
You wrote that, you loser.
She won't even talk to me.
That's her mom, man.
And l didn't write that.
Tami did.
Think about it, Rick.
Don't stress.
Don't stress, Rick.
[ Siren wails ]
Let's go, guys! Keep it tight!
Looking good! Looking good.
You've all earned yourself
a three-second break.
One, two, three.
All right, you know the drill.
Start unloading stuff.
Grab something
and keep it moving.
Pass me that shovel.
Wear that, Sanchez.
Here you go, buddy.
Come on, man!
Let's go, guys.
Clean all the trash.
Grab those rakes!
You're not into landscaping?
lt's one thing to run my guts out
for you not playing rugby,
but this sucks.
They can pay someone to do this.
Son, when are you gonna dig down
and first-string
the real Rick Penning?
l'm not your son.
Hey, guys, let's finish up!
Got to get to the sixth floor.
What's on the sixth floor?
You don't get what Coach Gelwix
is doing, do you?
lt's what he's not doing.
He iust wants you
to do your best.
Well, running until you puke
isn't my idea of rugby.
Well, maybe someone
who's coached 31 years
has some good ideas.
What are you doing?
Did he put you up to this?
No. What are you
talking about, huh?
l'm an only child.
l don't need a big brother.
How about a friend, hm?
ls that what you are?
Yeah.
How about that one?
You're gonna help out, right?
All right.
lt's not my thing.
First game!
Look at number 1 2.
So, you ladies
must be rugby fans.
What makes you say that?
Well, because you're sitting
in my fan section.
So, are you?
We're Highland fans, yeah.
Well, then, today's your lucky day.
l'm their new wing.
Really?
Are you any good?
Well, yeah.
l'm the best.
Wow. Then l guess l'll have
to keep my eye on you, huh?
You know, rugby's not
the only thing that l'm good at.
Let's go, guys! Come on!
Bring it together!
Let's go! Hustle, hustle!
Hey, Penning!
Get your butt down here!
Sorry to cut this short, ladies,
but they need me on the field.
Try not to hurt yourself!
Hey, l'm gonna say this once,
all right?
Back off.
Hey, baby. Don't stress.
They iust want to meet me.
[ Whistle blows ]
Bring it in, guys!
Let's go! Hustle.
Hustle, hustle, hustle.
Let's go.
Okay, listen up, guys.
We've got a couple
of changes today.
We're starting Sanchez at 1 3.
[ Cheers ]
Penning, you're at 2.
2?
Ah, give it up for him, guys.
Good iob, brah.
Peter!
Let's go.
Riggs.
-Thank you.
-Penning.
First game, gentlemen.
Play it like your last.
No regrets, all right?
Bring it in.
Highland Rugby on three!
One, two, three!
ALL: Highland Rugby! Whoo!
COACH: All right, guys.
Let's do it!
Let's go!
Congrats, man.
Read it. It's from a guy
that used to play your number.
l don't play hook.
You read it.
Look, brah, position
is everything, okay?
Coach Gelwix knows.
Just trust him.
No. He doesn't know.
He's been sitting over there
on his stupid lawn chair
ever since l've been here.
What don't l know?
l play wing.
l score.
That is what l do.
l doesn't matter who scores.
lt only matters that we score.
The team is the star here,
not any one player.
Rick, if you can't handle
or don't want to handle
our coaching or our rules,
that's fine.
Rugby's hard enough.
We're out to make it harder.
lt's your choice.
Just give it a shot, okay?
l'm on your side.
Crouch and hold...
...engage!
[ Whistle blows ]
Hey, get down.
Number 2!
You got to stay low. Get down.
Crouch and hold!
Engage!
ANNOUNCER: And the New Haven
scrum half-sets the ball.
Line captain. Warning, number 2.
Dangerous hit.
Come on.
The way we practiced, all right?
l don't play hook!
Come on, Penning!
Position, position!
An excellent pass
to Kurt Addison
results in New Haven
standing him up into a maul.
ANNOUNCER: Oh, Highland's
number 2 rips the ball out,
but he's clearly offsides.
l'm sure the refs
gonna call this one back.
[ Whistle blows ]
Forward pass.
l don't know how
you did it in Arizona,
but here we play as a team.
Okay, l don't play for your team.
l play for myself.
That's great! Real great!
We got to pull him.
They'll work it out.
ANNOUNCER: And our score,
New Haven 21 , Highland 1 4.
ANNOUNCER: New Haven scores
again, giving them a 26-1 4 lead.
And it is evident the crowd
is not pleased with Highland's
new hook, Rick Penning.
Highland not playing well
under the pressure.
You're willing
to take a loss for this kid?
lt's not always about rugby, Cal.
[ Whistle blows ]
[ Whistle blows ]
REFEREE: 10 minutes in the bin.
What?!
What are you talking about?
TEAMMATE: Just let it go.
Let's just play, okay?
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
COACH: Come on.
Let's get it, fellas!
ANNOUNCER, ON RADlO:
l_s over, folks.
New Haven
crushes Highland 47-1 4.
After 23 consecutive wins,
it was bound
to happen sometime.
[ Switches radio off ]
Did we do our best out there?
ALL, MUMBLING:
No, Coach.
lf they were bigger, stronger,
faster, that would be one thing.
lf they iust plain beat us,
we could keep our head up.
No regret.
But we didn't play
our game today.
We didn't put up our best.
We didn't leave it all
on the field.
We owe more to the guys whose
numbers you got on your backs.
So, let's go see
what you got left in the tank.
Practice doesn't make perfect!
Practice makes...
ALL: Permanent!
G E LWIX:
Who are we?
ALL: Highland Rugby. Kia kaha.
Yo, Kurt.
What's that mean?
lt means you don't belong here.
-Hey, what's your problem, man?
-You!
This isn't worth it!
No, you're not worth it, Penning.
But don't worry about it, all right?
'Cause every burnout
we've ever had quits.
By the way, you're bleeding.
COACH: All right, let's go!
Come on, let's go, let's go!
Hey, what's the secret sign,
my Arizona brother?
Well, you asked for that.
[ Buzzer, door unlocks ]
You're real funny.
Hey, brother number 2.
l have a beautiful wife
and great kids.
l love them all very much.
There's a brotherhood
on this Highland Rugby
that you're not going to feel
any other place or time.
Love it while you got it, brah.
You're not alone,
never on or off the field.
l'm always with you.
l care.
So do a couple of thousand others.
Make us proud.
Make yourself proud.
[ Laughter ]
ls you ready, man?
-Ready for what?
-Personal running.
Four miles a day,
ten 1 OO-yard sprints, ten 50s.
Coach upped the numbers
after you left.
l didn't leave.
l quit.
Yeah, but we didn't quit, man.
Leave me alone.
lt's 5:OO in the morning.
How did you guys
even get in here?
Well, let's iust say Coach Gelwix
called in a favor.
So, we're gonna
be going or what?
You guys are both insane.
[ Laughter ]
And, man, you stink!
GRIGGSIE: Yeah, that's me, baby.
KURT: Tradition. Griggsie
doesn't shower during season.
Why?
Well, it's bad karma.
Do you want a hug, buddy?
No.
[ Laughter ]
Come on, man.
Let's go. Get up.
Come on. Get up, man.
-Yeah. That's right.
-All right.
Let's do it!
Hey, Ricardo!
Come on.
Let's pick it up, guys.
l got an early class today.
COACH PENNING: No. He would
never play for Gelwix.
Uh, well, l talked to him.
l guess the iudge
will let him out early if he does.
But, you know, this way he'll be
out in time for nationals.
Yeah, and back here
to play for us.
And loaded with all their strategies,
secret plays, and stuff.
Maybe he wanted to surprise you.
What position?
Huh?
What position is he playing?
Hook.
l think. l don't know.
He was moaning about it.
[ School bell rings ]
All right, guys.
Let's hit the field.
See you out there, Coach.
[ Tumo speaking in Maori ]
Father in heaven, bless us,
Father in heaven, bless us,
to do our best,
to play well,
to play safe.
Bless the other team
from Sweden...
Scotland.
.. .whatever,
to do the same.
Thank you for past brothers
who are with us.
Help us to remember
what has been done by them before,
to feel the ma'na,
the power of family,
those living, those gone,

We stand on this field
ready for battle,
[ Shouting haka ]
Heh!
At our backs,
we feel the might of tradition,
remembering to honor our family
and our ancestors
who have gone before.
Over our hearts...
[ Speaking in Maori ]

passing now to their fullback,
Quentin Owens,
who slides...
That's it, kiddo!
[ Team chants ]
ANNOUNCER:
Owens with another 5 points,
and Highland's starting
to put this one away.
Every time they try
to get something going,
Highland iust crushes it.
[ Whistle blows ]
-Was that you?
-Yeah, man.
Great tackle.
Thanks.
There's been good scrapping
on both sides,
but at 29 to Scotland 7,
this exhibition has turned
into a Highland clinic.
Yeah!
That was so good!
Way to play tonight, brah.
That's what l'm talking about.
You was in the zone tonight.
Hey, l'll be back, now.
Give me a second.
You iust can't seem to stay away.
How did l do?
Not bad for a rookie.
l know this is gonna be tough on you,
but l don't have another game
until next week,
so you're gonna have
to hang in there another six days.
Ooh. Yeah, you're right.
l iust don't know
if l can wait that long.
-Can you?
-FRIEND: Oh, never!
Rama!
Griggsie's leaving
within 1 O minutes, so...
...come on, let's go!
What's a Rama?
l'll show you. Come on.
l'll see you later.
Bye.
Wow, muchas gracias, señorita.
Welcome to Ranch-A-Rama.
Would you like one or two pieces?
Huh?
She wants to know
how much you want, bud.
Whole thing.
Well, yeah, but...
Well, it is all you can eat, right?
Honestly, is it me, or did Rick
actually pass the ball tonight?
Yeah, good iob!
Hey! Hey!
But that's only 'cause
he thought hisself was open.
[ Laughter ]
Kurt, start it up!
KURT: Ohhh!
# Uh-huh!

[ Laughter ]
# You know we stay legit #
Highland, my main man!
[ Cheering ]
Huh, huh, huh, huh!
Hey, wait a second.
Pull over real quick.
No bus, my car.
l don't want to pull over.
Just pull over, all right?
C'mon, man. It's kind of late.
Just pull over.
Always trying to kill my vibes.
l thought we had a iack.
Oh, don't worry about it.
We got two.
Oh, good.
l still can't get
the wheel off, though.
Okay.
[ Door slams ]
Let's go.
Go. Ooh-uh.
[ Both grunt ]
Ooh, cool! Let me try!
What did l tell you?
Stay out of the street.
Hey, Kurt. You need a hand?
Don't worry about it.
l got it.
l want you to stand
right over here.
[ Speaking indistinctly ]
Soccer is for kids.
Football is for wussies.
Rugby's for men.
You keep that, eh?
-WOMAN: What do you say?
-Thank you.
Lift open the trunk.
Thanks.
[ Tires screeching,
car horns honking ]
[ Motor racing ]
Kurt!
Kurt, Kurt, come on.
Come on, man.
You'll be okay.
Tumo, go get help! Go get help!
Kurt!
Stay with us, man. Come on.
Stay with us.
What's going on?
What happened? What?
lt's Kurt, man.
He's in surgery, man.
He iust needs to run it out, son.
[ Breathing heavily ]
Never had a player
who wanted to win more.
lncredible athlete.
Rugby was in his blood.
He didn't always like to listen.
He blew out a knee
a game before nationals,
and all his dreams
for an overseas pro rugby career
iust gone like that.
Your father would swear
to this day that he got hurt
because l played him
in the wrong position.
Why haven't you told me
about this?
Better question --
why hasn't he?
Well, l tell you what, guys.
Let's bring it in, okay?
Come on.
Bring it in.
Now, ''Q ''
what do you say, buddy?
Come on, ''Q.''
[ Sobs ]
Penning.
''Q.''
l tutor him, if you have to know.
l don't.
Let's go! Pick up the pace!
Let's move it!
Let's go! Let's go!
Move, move, move!
Penning!
Coach?
Rick, step into my office.
