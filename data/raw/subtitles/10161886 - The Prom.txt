[man clears throat]
[gavel banging]
Let's get to it.
All those in favor…
All opposed.
Well, the PTA has an accepted
set of rules concerning the prom.
Young ladies must wear
non-revealing dresses.
Young men must wear suits or tuxes.
And if a student chooses to bring a date,
they must be of the opposite sex.
Well, can't you just ban this student?
Well, we've been advised
that there may be some legal repercussions
if we prevent this girl from attending,
so although it breaks my heart,
we have no choice.
- There won't be a prom.
- [reporter 1] Mrs. Greene, a question.
[reporter 2] Have you asked the students
what they think of this?
[reporter 1]
Are you choosing not to comment?
[reporter 2] Hey, there's Emma!
Can we get a comment?
[reporter 3] Can you answer
some questions?
[reporter 1] Can we get a statement?
[reporter 2] Emma, what do you think
of the PTA's decision to cancel prom?
[reporter 1] Emma, do you have a response?
[upbeat music playing]

[Frank] It's Frank DiLella

We're here for the opening night
of Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Musical,
starring the incomparable Dee Dee Allen.
- Dee Dee! You're a Broadway star.
- Yes, I am. [chuckles]
You have your choice of roles.
What drew you to Eleanor?
Well, Eleanor Roosevelt
was a brave, powerful, charismatic woman
who no one had ever heard of.
Her story needs to be told.
People need to know
it is possible to change the world,
whether you're
a homely middle-aged First Lady
or a Broadway star! [chuckles]
Barry Glickman! You were brilliant as FDR.
From the moment
I first stepped into FDR's shoes…
And when I say "shoes," I mean wheelchair.
…I had an epiphany.
I realized there is no difference
between the president of the United States
and a celebrity.
We both have power.
The power to change the world.
It's a weighty responsibility.
Let's talk process.

[all exclaim]
New York Post,
Associated Press, New York Times.
- [all gasp]
- The New York Times!
Wow…
[Dee Dee] What?
- [Sheldon] Wow…
- What's happening?
This is not a review you want
when you have crappy advance sales.
This is gonna close us.
What didn't they like? Was it the hip-hop?
Yes, but not only that.
- For God's sake, Sheldon. Just read it.
- What? Read.
[Sheldon] Okay, just the highlights.
"Barry Glickman's FDR might just be
the most insultingly misguided,
offensive, and laughable performance
that this reviewer has ever had
the squirming misfortune to endure."
That's not so bad.
- Do her. Do her.
- I'm just saying.
Oh? Mmm.
"Watching Dee Dee Allen's
Eleanor Roosevelt
croaking out a heavy-handed
message of activism
is like paying an aging drag queen
to shove a syrup-soaked
American flag down my throat."
Well, that…
That's not criticism.
That's just… It's just a per…
[voice breaking] …a personal attack.
"If you're considering buying a ticket
to this show, do yourself a favor."
"Buy a few feet
of good, heavy rope instead
and then go hang yourself."
[Barry] Oh, God! Oh, God!
[mutters] What?
Was the show really that bad?
It's not the show. It's you two.
You're just not likeable.
- What?
- What?
Nobody likes a narcissist.
- Oh, this… [clears throat]
- Oh, that.
Leave it to me. I'll go and try
and change the narrative once again.
- I hate this world! This is bullshit!
- Just horrible. It's just… It hurts.
It… It hurts my heart.
- [Barry exhales]
- Where did everybody go?
- What can I get you?
- [both] Yola Mezcal blackberry smash.
[bartender] My condolences, Dee Dee.
But remember, you have friends.
Thank you. Who are you?
Trent Oliver.
Uh, oh…
- We've done five shows together.
- Oh, really? Oh, my God.
Trent went to Juilliard.
Won't shut up about it.
- Oh, right, Trent! Of course, Trent!
- Trent.
[Trent and Dee Dee chuckle]
Why are you dressed like a waiter?
- I'm in between gigs at the moment.
- [Dee Dee] Hmm.
Honestly, Dee Dee, I feel adrift
as I did in my days before Juilliard.
Oh, my God.
You see, my passions are fueled
by the power of Lady Theater
and how she can,
with a gentle touch of her hand,
sculpt a human soul.
- But we learned at Juilliard…
- Oh, mother of God.
If I could soliloquize,
"If you prick me, do I not bleed?"
"And if you do not pay me,
do I not still act?"
That might be enough.
Still, I have played Hamlet,
and yet I'm only known as that guy
from the beloved early aughts' sitcom…
[Trent] Talk to the Hand.
["Hold My Hand" playing]
{\an8}[audience laughing]
I question
the very meaning of my existence.
[jazzy tune playing]
Maggie Smith once approached me
in a men's bathroom and she said,
"Who sent you? Was it Michelle Dockery?"
"Because the court said 500 yards."
You could tell she was scared.
- Hey, guys!
- [Barry] Angie! Angie.
I'm sorry your show
closed on opening night again!
[Barry and Dee Dee groan]
Welcome to the world
of the unemployed. Top me off.
I thought you were in Chicago.
[groans] I just quit.
Twenty years in the chorus and they still
wouldn't let me play Roxie Hart.
- [Dee Dee] Aw.
- You wanna know who's playing the role?
- Kelly Ripa?
- Cher?
- Connie Chung.
- Kris Jenner?
No, Tina Louise.
Ginger from Gilligan's Island.
Oh, my God, is she still alive?
[laughs]
[sighs]
We're wasting our lives.
Hmm, it's true.
At least we're all in the same boat.
"Misery acquaints a man
with strange bedfellows."
- [Barry] Oh, my God.
- That's from The Tempest.
Okay, one, shut up.
Two, I refuse to give up, okay?
We're… We're still celebrities.
We still have power.
[chuckles]
Now, The Times
sort of castrated you as it were.
[Barry sighs]
Yep. They wrote you off
as aging narcissists.
I still don't understand
what's wrong with that.
There's a very simple way
that we can still love ourselves
yet appear to be
decent human beings, okay?
We will become celebrity activists.
- [Angie] Oh! Brilliant!
- [Barry] Right?
- All we need is a cause.
- A cause célèbre.
Everybody think of some causes. Go.
- Um, poverty?
- Too big.
World hunger.
That is also a major thing.
No, we need something we can handle.
Some little injustice
we can drive to. Recycling.
- Let's see what's trending.
- [Barry] Recycling's good.
- Why are there so many award shows?
- Parking.
- [Barry] Or the TVs in the back of cabs.
- Oh! Oh, yeah, what about this girl?
Oh, my gosh. Check this out.
- [Barry] What girl?
- It's all over Twitter.
[Barry] Oh.
She's from Edgewater, Indiana.
She's a lesbian. She wanted to take
her girlfriend to the high school prom,
and the PTA went apeshit
and they canceled it.
They canceled prom?
- Are they allowed to do that?
- No.
[reporter] Principal Hawkins,
your response.
The first thing I'm going to do
is contact the Indiana state's attorney.
{\an8}This is not about school rules.
This is a civil rights case.
{\an8}Wait, seriously?
{\an8}I'm betting pressure from the state's
attorney will stop these bigots cold.
{\an8}It better.
Because I'll tell you this much.
{\an8}If word gets out,
people are gonna get mad.
{\an8}This pisses me off.
{\an8}The next thing you know,
some modern-day Eleanor Roosevelt
is gonna march down here
and all hell's gonna break loose.
We have got to go down there
and raise holy hell.
We will be the biggest thing
to happen in Indiana
since… whatever's happened in Indiana.
- So this is it? This is our cause?
- Yes. Are you with me?
[all cheer]
- We'll have a rally!
- Yes!
- We'll have picket signs!
- We'll make T-shirts.
We'll get Sheldon to tag along.
He can find us a venue.
Oh, wow!
- Can we actually do this?
- You bet your sweet MILF ass we can!

- It's our way of saying thank you, Emma.
- Yeah. Thanks for canceling prom.
I didn't cancel prom. Your parents did.
Come on. Lay off her.
- Oh, are you on her side now?
- [scoffs] No.
I'm just not in third grade.
See you at practice.

Oh, come on, you know

They don't vote for you.
They vote for your brand.
My brand is
a little tarnished at the moment.
'Cause of the infamous tirade
at the Longacre Theatre?
When a cell phone goes off
in the middle of a performance…
- I can't be held responsible.
- It was your cell phone!
- I didn't know that!
- It was in your wig!
I didn't know that at the time. Anyway…
All the goodwill that we're gonna get
from this thing will wash me clean,

You're just greedy.
I'd be happy with one Tony.

I need a win.
I'm so sick of all the rejection.
I'm no Dee Dee Allen.

No, I mean Trent. He's retching again.

I got into this business,
yes, because I loved it,
but also to prove
to everyone who doubted me,
my… teachers, the kids
on the school bus, my horrible parents,
that I could do something.
Something important.
[exhales]
That's exactly what we are doing.

I'm sorry, you're telling us

No, the state's attorney
wants us to hold an inclusive prom.
- Yes.
- [audience murmurs]
Because that's what they feel
best reflects America's values.
Well, this isn't America. This is Indiana.
[audience applauds]
All right.

Again, it is not a homosexual prom.
It is an inclusive prom…
- With homosexuals.
- You don't have to attend...
You don't have to attend
if you don't want to.
Look… I… I'm sorry you're upset,
but the organization of the prom is
within the purview of the student council.
Let's hear what they have to say. Alyssa?
- Uh… Okay.
- [scattered applause]
[feedback whines]
Well, we want prom to go on, obviously.
It's supposed to be

Okay. No, thank you. It's fine, everyone.
Sweetheart, I'm so sorry,

This is about government…

It's about big government

[Principal Hawkins] Okay. Okay.
This is not about government intervention.
Emma, what is this about?
I just want to go to prom
like any other kid.
[Principal Hawkins]
Mmm-hmm. But you can't.
She can't, and that's why
the courts are involved.
Ask yourself.
What exactly is it that you find
so frightening about gay people?

[sighs]
Excuse me, Miss Allen.
I'm Tom. Tom Hawkins.
I am the principal and I just, um…
What are you doing?
We have come to show this community
that gay people
and gay-positive icons, such as myself,
[inhales] are made of the same
flesh and blood as they are.
Uh-huh.
If they don't have gay people here,
why is my Scruff going crazy right now?
We're not monsters.
We're cultural disruptors. [chuckles]
I'm a fan.
- Really?
- Yeah. Yes, I am. [giggles]
[gasps]
[chuckles] What kind of a fan?
Big fan? Small fan? Scary stabby fan?
You could say that I'm a big fan. Yes.
Really? That's so surprising
because you're not my usual demographic.
- You mean Black?
- No, straight.
You are straight, right?
Yes. I am.
Straight people like Broadway too.
[chuckles] I've heard that.
Always thought it was a fairy tale.
- [chuckles] So to speak.
- [chuckles] So to speak. Well, it's true.
Um, I've been a fan since I saw you
in the show for which
you won your first Tony.
- No! You saw Swallow the Moon?
- I did.
The number at the top of the second act,
"The Lady's Improving"? Chills.
[chuckles] That song made me a star.
It made me a fan.
- Uh, Dee Dee, we gotta make haste.
- Okay.
Uh, Miss Allen, I just…
This is a very delicate situation.
I'm asking you and your friends
to back off for a few days.
- Back off?
- Yeah.
Backing off
is exactly what we're not going to do.
I see what's happening here.
You're trying to disarm me with flattery.
It's not going to work, Tom.
Flattery makes me stronger.
Fuels my ego.
- [Alyssa] That was insane.
- I know.
- I'm really freaking out.
- Don't freak out.
We have a plan, remember?
We're gonna get dressed up and go to prom

not hide anymore.

You're the guy from Talk to the Hand.
It's on every night at 9:00 after...
- Can I have my room, please?
- Okay, let's get started. All right?
- Let's change some minds.
- [Angie] Uh…
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- [Angie] Oh! A wishing well!
- [Dee Dee gasps]
Make a wish, Dee Dee.
Death. I wish for death.
Okay, Sheldon's working on a venue.
Now, how's the song?
Uh, about that.
I was misled by my representation.
Mr. Sondheim is not a fan
of my Sweeney Todd.
- Quite the opposite, actually.
- [Barry] Oh, my God…
Jesus, Trent, you screwed us.
Don't worry.
I wrote something myself. Yeah.
It's quite rousing,
and in a very humane key.
The Godspell kids will back us up,
and they have their own costumes.
You're welcome.
- Oh, my God. [giggles]
- Yeah!
- This is awful.
- [giggles]
We can't perform this.
They'll boo us off the stage.
No, all we need is a simple message
that tugs at the heartstrings
and a little pageantry.
- We have everything we need right here.
- Except a venue.
O ye of little faith.
[chuckles] I got one!
And a crowd of 2,500 guaranteed.
- What?
- That's amazing!
What is it? One of those
beautiful Antebellum theaters?
No, it's, uh…
An arena.
An arena?
- [engines roaring]
- [loud rock music playing]
So it's come to this.
[engine revving]
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
Truckosaurus,
the car-eating robot dinosaur,
will not be your
half-time entertainment today.
Instead, we have some guests
who've come from New York
to sing us a song about intolerance.
- [crowd jeering]
- Hi there.
I'm Trent Oliver, actor, activist…
And Juilliard graduate.
Emma, this one's for you.

[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, two-time
Tony Award winner, Miss Dee Dee Allen.
- Trent, I could rip your face off.
- I'm sorry.
[Barry] You made me fail.
I am so sick of failing.
What do we do now?
We leave.
- First we kill Trent, then we leave.
- What about the girl?
- [Dee Dee sighs]
- [Principal Hawkins] Hello, everyone…
We have some news. Emma and I
wanted to be the ones to tell you,
thanks to pressure from the state's
attorney's office, prom is back on!
- [Barry] What?
- Prom is back on! [squeals]
- [all cheering]
- We did it!
Yay!
See? We're not narcissists.
Just to be clear, uh,
it's not because of you…
Well, maybe it was.
I mean, everybody started freaking out
when you got here.
The lawyer might've had legal power,
but you really scared people.
- [Angie] Aw!
- We scared people!
Important thing is, it's a victory.
Now you get to go to prom
like everybody else!
- [Angie] Yes!
- What are you gonna wear?
I was thinking like a vintage tux
and some high tops.
I don't know. Does it matter?
- Does it…
- [scoffs]
[snickers]
- Honey…
- Sweetheart, boo-boo.
I don't know you, okay?
And you don't know me,
but I am begging you,
let me dress you for the prom.
- Okay? Yeah?
- Okay.
We're going to Saks.
- Uh, there's no Saks here.
- We have a Kmart!
- A what?
- A Kmart.
- [laughs]
- [Barry] Fine.
We'll check out
the Reba McEntire collection at Kmart,
do a little fashion show.
Okay! Oh, can we do it tomorrow?
We can meet at my place.
I have to go and find out
if I still have a date.
Sure. I'll go ahead, do a pre-shop.
Okay? Will you give me a ride
in your pickup truck?
Are you saying that because I'm a lesbian,
I drive a pickup?
- Well, do you? [chuckles]
- Shut up.
- [Sheldon] Anybody hungry?
- [Angie] I could drink.
- [Sheldon] What's around here?
- I saw a Big Boy by the highway.
- [Sheldon] Ooh, they have a gay bar here?
- [Angie] I love Big Boy.
Oh, gay bar. Can't go. I'd be mobbed.
- Oh! Of course.
- [both chuckle]
- So, it's nice to see Emma smile again.
- Yes.
She's had a rough go of it.
I gathered that. Yeah.
- Even before the prom controversy.
- Oh?
When she came out, her parents,
well, they threw her out of the house.
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah. She was 16.
- It was, uh, pretty ugly.
- Oh…
Anyway, um…
Thank you for helping her…
- Or trying to.
- [both chuckle softly]
[Dee Dee] Yeah…
- Uh, Tom?
- Yes, yeah?
Is there a restaurant in town
that has plates and cutlery and…
Oh, uh, there's an Applebee's by the mall.
[gasps]
- Would you like to go?
- Yes.
Take me now to this Apples & Bees place.
- [giggles]
- All right.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
How nice of you.
[indistinct chatter and laughter]
- Guess what today is?
- What?

I've seen six promposals today.
People are gonna see us
dancing together and kissing.
It's gonna be impossible not to kiss you.
Oh, my God, and you know,
what's my mom going to think?
I mean, she'll be in public,

[Dee Dee and Principal Hawkins laughing]
I save all of my money.
I go to New York every summer.
- I see as many Broadway shows as I can.
- Oh.
When I run out of money,
I second act them.
- Oh.
- Don't tell anybody.
- Bad!
- [both chuckle]
My point is,
I've seen you many, many times.
Oh.
Mr. Hawkins.
Mrs. Greene.
Hello. I'm Dee Dee Allen.
- We haven't officially met.
- No.
- Hello. Dee Dee Allen.
- We're aware.
Ms. Allen, I'm sure that you are
very well-versed in the ways of the world
and Broadway in particular.
That's a community.
But you don't know us.
You don't know this town and our values.
No, well, I'm just here
advocating on behalf of a young girl
whose voice perhaps is not heard
by some in the community.
Yes. Well, perhaps you should stick
to acting instead of activism.
Enjoy your meal.
[smacks lips]
We didn't mean
to make anything worse here.
I appreciate everything that you're doing.
Well, let's just drop it.
Yeah.
Tell me… [chuckles softly]
I've never said this before to anyone.
Tell me about you.
- About me?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm just a small-town principal.
Uh, you know, it can be frustrating,
but, uh, at least I have a job.
Yeah, lucky you.
Single.
Sorry?
I'm single. Just putting that out there.
Really? [giggles]
I'm surprised.
Oh, well, I'm surprised you're surprised.
[chuckles] The two things
I'm most passionate about in the world
are Broadway musicals
and secondary school administration.
Oh.
I typed that into a dating website once,
and a little message popped up that said,
"You will have zero matches forever."
[both chuckle]
But you're so smart
and you're really good-looking.
- [clears throat]
- Well, if I…
[clears throat] Thank you.
It's just, I look at people like you,
and I just think how lucky you are
to be surrounded by your people.
My wh... My people? [chuckles]
I wasn't born on Broadway. You know?
I'm from Zelienople, Pennsylvania.
Yeah, I grew up dirt poor.
[clears throat]
This whole… [rolls tongue]
All this, I invented it.
Yeah. I'm just a small-town girl and…
- I had a big dream.
- Hmm.
Single, just putting it out there.
[both chuckle]
Well, I'm divorced.
Oh, I think I read about that.
Eddie Sharpe, the talk show host?
Yeah, right.
It lasted 15 heart-pulverizing years.
I imagine it must be hard being
Dee Dee Allen, being a Broadway star.
You know, it is hard.
Sometimes I think I really…
I just want to quit.
No. No, please, you can't...
You can't do that.
[laughing] Why not?
Because I need you to do what you do.

It's sweet.
Well…
You know, she needed proof
she was still part of the family,
and nothing says family
like a Sears family portrait.
- Is there booze in this?
- There sure is.
- [coughs] When you said lemonade…
- Well, it's Indiana lemonade.
Okay, it's official. I love you.
You're the cool grandmother I never had.
Hey, let me ask you something.
What happened with Emma?
[sighs]
You're not a mother,
so you can't know what it's like
to see your own daughter
give up her child.
I'm sorry.
When Emma came out,
oh, they could not handle it.
To bad parents and their broken progeny.
Although Emma is fine. She's a strong kid.
[Barry] Mmm.
Oh, I wasn't talking about her.
What? You got kicked out too?
Well, I left before they could do that.
[Emma] So the only
nice dress I have is this.
Wow.
Okay, I mean, yeah, yep,
you could wear that to prom
or keep it lying around
in case there's a remake of
Little House on the Prairie.
Okay. That's it. I like him.
Emma, please let me
dress you for this prom.
I don't know. This is all so crazy.
What did you wear to your prom?
Well, I was going to wear a silver tux,
aqua accessories, the whole look.
I waited outside, anxious to see my crush,
but when I saw him with his date, I froze.
I couldn't go in.
I didn't have your courage.
This isn't about me.
This is about you.
And I promise you are going
to have the night of your life.
What is your date wearing?
I don't know.
I've never been to her house before.
Her mom doesn't know about us.
How long have you been together?
- A year and a half.
- Oh, honey.
But she's coming out tonight, big time.
That's the plan.
I'm really scared.
Would you get over here?
The point is you are brave.
You made all this happen.
When you walk into that gym tonight,
you know what people are gonna see?
They're going to see
the bravest person on the planet.
This is so hard.
Does every girl go through this?
Yes, all across town,
girls are spraying on their tans
and whitening their teeth,
trying to look their best for the prom,
but they're wasting their time
because they don't have the glow
that you have right now.
I trust you completely,
and that's kind of scary too.
Can we please go shop? Can we mall it?
- Is that okay?
- Yes, mall the hell out of it!
- Let's go.
- Okay!
But get changed. This is disgusting.

- Are you ready?
- We're ready. We can't wait.
- Here, hold this. I wanna get the picture.
- Okay. here we go.
- [Sheldon] Wow.
- [Dee Dee] Oh, my God!
- [gasps] Look at you!
- [Dee Dee squeals]
You look amazing!
[Emma] Are you sure it's not too girly?
Aw. No, it's just
the right amount of girly.
- You did well.
- Right?
Hey, where's your date?
We're meeting in the gym.
She's still a little shy about all this.
Well, this is where we leave you.
- [Angie laughs]
- Our work here is done.
You go. You have the time of your life.
Can you walk me in? I'm a little nervous.
Of course. Hey, hold on tight.
- Ready?
- Yep.
- Clutch in this hand.
- Oh, sorry!
Aw.
Come on.
- [Trent] Who wants punch?
- [Angie] Only if it's spiked.
The walk away. The cute little truck.
[camera shutter clicking]
- [Emma] We're doin' it!
- [Barry] Go ahead.
[Emma] What's going on?
I'm putting the pieces together.
Gimme a sec.
- [Barry] What is happening?
- [Emma] Where is everybody?
Something is really wrong.
The whole parking lot is completely empty.
[Sheldon] God. What's the theme
of this prom? Death row?
Mr. Hawkins, where are all the kids?
I don't understand.
Mom, what's happening?
Why aren't we at the gym?
At the last minute, there was a problem,
so we had to change venues.
No, Mom, what's going on?
The courts told the PTA
they had to hold an inclusive prom.
Don't worry. It's fine.
We did what we were required to do.
There was some resistance.
So the parents met without my knowledge,
and they've organized two proms.
One for the kids
at the Elks Lodge in town.
And this one just for you.
- We gave her a prom.
- You did what?
Wait, no, no.
I got texts from kids at school.
Everybody said it was here.
And they were lying to you.
It was part of the plan.
- You lied to me.
- Oh, yeah? Who's the liar?
We know about you and Emma,
and trust me, we're doing you a favor.
No.
- Oh, my God. This is so cruel.
- I'm gonna cry.
Okay, honey. Look at me.
- Angie.
- Yeah.
- I want to go home.
- I know you do.
- This isn't happening.
- And you got us, and this is awful.
- No, no.
- Honey.

- Alyssa?
- I swear I had no idea.
How could you not know?
You were on the prom committee.
It was Shelby and Kaylee.
They figured out we were together
and they made sure I didn't find out.
- They didn't want me to tell you.
- Then come meet me.
I can't.
Look, my mother's here.
[crying] Well, leave her.
Tell her you're gay!
Tell her we're in love.
That was the plan, wasn't it?
[shakily] I'm really sorry.
Have fun at the normal person's prom.
- Wait. Emma.
- [call ends]
Emma!
[sniffles]
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
We are going to that prom, okay?
They can't stop us.
We will march into that room...
No! No, enough.
This is already
the worst night of my life.
Please, just stop helping me.
Emma! Emma!
This is a complete disaster.
[Sheldon] This is a PR problem.
No, Sheldon.
We had a PR problem back in New York.
This was supposed to solve that.
But this…
This is heartbreaking.
This is why you came here? For publicity?
[sniffles]
[indistinct chatter]
[Mrs. Greene] I have been asked
to read a statement.
"What happened here
was not the result of some elaborate plan
to humiliate this girl,
as has been reported in the press."
"The James Madison High School
Parent-Teacher Association
felt Emma would not be safe
if we allowed her
to attend prom with the other students
because the uncomfortable truth
is there are people in our community
who are offended by her life choices."
I can't even wrap my head around this.
It's a nightmare. Oh, my God!
I wanna be the cockeyed optimist here
'cause I played Nellie Forbush
in South Pacific.
It was a dinner theater production, but…
Ugh.
This is horrible. It really is.
Thanks for hanging out with me
these past couple of days.
You've been a good friend.
- I have?
- You have. You seem surprised.
No, I just…
I'm a chorus girl. You know, I just…
[sighs]
No one ever thanks me.
They don't even see me.
Spend my whole life
trying to stay in the game,
and keep my day-drinking under control.
[snickers]
That's really nice. Thanks, kid.
Hey, you're going to get through this.
I know it.
[inhales shakily]
I thought that when my parents
rejected me and stopped loving me
that I would never feel any worse,
you know?
Mmm-hmm.
And now this…
And I feel worse.
- Honey…
- I've never felt so alone in my life.
But you're not alone. You're not.
You got me. Hmm?
And we are ride-or-die,
and you do have friends.
Where are they?
- [Dee Dee] This is it.
- [Trent] Yes.
- No.
- Well, okay.
[knocking on door]
- [doorbell rings]
- [knocking at door]
- Emma, can we come in?
- Yes.
- We brought Häagen-Dazs.
- [Trent] That's fancy ice cream.
I know what Häagen-Dazs is. Hand it over.
Emma, I know you said
you didn't want us to help anymore,
but we cannot let them get away with this.
We have got to fight back.
Okay, I know everybody's really angry.
But I think we have to admit
that we have made things worse.
I think the best thing we can do
is disinfect our things and go back home.
- No, we are not leaving.
- No!
Dee Dee, we are gonna stay here,
and we're going to turn this thing around.
- We gotta take back the press.
- [Trent] Yes, how?
Emma, you've got to step up
and be the face of this thing.
And that's going to get her a prom?
This is not about a prom anymore.
This is about right and wrong.
We need a national audience, prime time.
You want a big audience fast?
We gotta use our ace in the hole.
- One call to Eddie Sharpe is all we need.
- No. No.
- [Trent] Dee Dee!
- He's right.
If I ask him for something,
he will want something in return,
and what he will want
is the Hamptons house.
He's been trying to get it for years.
Okay. Okay, fine. Look, Sheldon,
you got to get that girl on TV.
- Okay.
- Great.
No, not great.
I'm sorry, but there is no way
I'm getting in front of a camera
and telling my story
to millions of people. I can't do that.
- See?
- Please. Please, just go.
- Emma, if you do nothing... Okay.
- Barry. Go.
- Okay, I get it. Okay. Okay.
- [Angie] Go. Go, go, go. Go, go.
[whispering] I got this.
I know what I'm doing.
Let me do my thing.
There must be a way to rid this community,
and by extension, the nation,
of this cancer of intolerance.
What are you even doing here?
What happened to Godspell?
Indianapolis was canceled,
as was the naval base at Guantánamo Bay.
What I'm thinking I'm going to do is this.
Venture forth and seek out
the young people and rap,
in a non-musical sense.
[Angie] Mmm.
Let's go get some more, huh?
Two spoons this time.
Come on.
[Angie] Gotta stop. [chuckling]
Before you lecture me or kick me to death
with those crazy antelope legs of yours,
or whatever you're gonna do,
I know I should do something.
I just can't.
You gotta do this.
You gotta do it for all of us people
that are standing in the wings,
waiting to go on.
- I'm too scared.
- Hmm.
Let me tell you a story.
It's 1975
and the original company of Chicago
is in previews,
and the worst flu in history
hits the cast.
They're down to the third cover
for the role of Roxie Hart
and she's scared, just like you are.
And Fosse, who is a real ballbuster,

and she's petrified.
Worst of all, she's doing the routine
like she's a robot.
So the Foss, he says,
"Hey, kid. Snap out of it."
[jazz music playing]
"You got the steps."
"You've got the notes."
"Where's the zazz, baby?"
And even though
she'd never heard that word before,
she knew immediately what it meant.
And she went out there
and she found that spotlight,
and she crushed that performance so hard,
she had that whole audience standing
on their feet screaming bloody murder!
[sighs]
And that girl was you!
What?
How old do you think I am?
It was 1975! No.
The point is
every Fosse girl knows that story.
It's all about finding your light.

it's time to show it to the world.
- You think you know how?
- Yeah!
[both laughing]
You've sort of been,
you know, the woman in my life.
You've been the man in mine.
[man] And I was thinking
this could be our last time…
We shouldn't be doing this.
Oh, it's rom-com Friday.
Rom-com Friday is sacred.
We should be helping Emma.
- We gotta get her on TV.
- Sheldon is on it. Come on.
- How does this work, anyway?
- [Barry] It's infrared.
- It reduces inflammation.
- [Dee Dee] Oh, good.
But you can't keep it on too long.
It'll blow your face off.
What?
[both chuckling]
♪ Someday when I'm awfully low ♪
♪ And the world is cold… ♪
Saw this movie with Eddie.
- It was our first date.
- [Barry] Was it really?
- Yeah.
- [Barry] Mmm.
Then he… took me out for dinner after.
Well, I took him out. [chuckles]
He didn't have any money.
He was just starting out in comedy,
and he didn't have the big show like now.
Fifteen years, he didn't have any money.
And I picked up the tab. I paid.
- [Barry] That was a bad move.
- [Dee Dee] No kidding. I'm still paying.
[Dee Dee sighs]
Can I make an observation?
[sighs] Is it a pleasant observation
or is it an irritating one?
You're not over him.
No, don't say that. I am not…
Trust me. I am…
[chuckling] I am way over him.
I'm just mad at myself, you know, I am so…
Why it took me so long to…
Figure it out.
You know? I believed him.
I believed him every single time.
"I promise you, it's nothing."
"It's meaningless.
She's nothing to me. It's over."
I finally got the message, you know.
He didn't love me. [chuckles]
He didn't…
[chuckling] He didn't even like me.
But he liked the money.
Oh, yeah, so I got out.
I got out…
And I gave him half my money.
And now here we are, singing to trucks.
- And he's got a hit TV show.
- [audience cheering]
And I still owe him
half my unemployment check.
[announcer on TV] It's Eddie Sharpe!
[Eddie] Whoa, hey!
Welcome, everybody!
What's today's words of wisdom?
[Eddie and audience] Never sign a prenup!
[all laughing through TV]
And you know what the worst part is?
I shut down.
He took my little,
delicate blueberry heart,
and he just… squished it.
[Dee Dee sniffles]
- What?
- Here's what you're gonna do, okay?
You're gonna wear something
heart-stopping, like that yellow cape
and those cute little boots.
And you are gonna march down
to that principal's office
like a bad, bad girl.
[chuckling] Tom?
- Tom is a fan. Friend.
- [Barry] Hmm?
Well…
He likes you.
As a fan. Friend.
I don't know.
Not even that much anymore.
Okay, let's cut the crap.
I would kill, kill,
to have a guy look at me
the way that he looks at you.
Stop it.
You're just…
You're poking my heart with your finger.
Your still-beating,
delicate little blueberry heart?
Do you think he really, really likes me?
Oh, my God, yes!
Barry! [kisses]
[laughing]
- I love you! I love you!
- I love you! I love you!
You're just such a great… everything.
[laughing]
[Dee Dee] Okay, no, no, no. Okay.
This, the master stroke, your idea.
- And the boots?
- And the little cute boots.
[chuckling]
This is it.
Oh!
That is good.
Mmm, now…
You.
I've been thinking about you
since we got here.
Oh, God. I knew this was gonna
somehow turn around to me.
And I think it's time somebody poked
that gay little heart of yours.
Are we doing this? Fine. Uh…
Do I only go for 10s
when I know I'm a 6.2? Yes and...
Your parents. You're from Ohio, right?
So?
We're in Indiana.
- Ohio, Indiana, they're close.
- I can see where you're driving this.
You have two living parents
that you'll never be nearer to
than you are right now.
- I think you should call them.
- No.
They threw me away.
Well, did they really?
I told them that I was gay,
and they said that they would take me
to therapy to change myself completely.
Let your parents see who you are
before it's too late.
If you don't…
You'll regret it.
I'm not the one who should have regrets.
[voice breaking] I was the kid.
I was the kid!
[crying] I was 16.
Sixteen years old. I was terrified.
Terrified!
And I needed one thing from them
and they couldn't give it to me.
So don't you…
[sobbing]
[school bell ringing]
[woman over PA]
Would the following students
please report to after-school detention?
Harlan Doolittle…
Hi.
…Olivia Blanc, Frances Doolittle.
Thank you.
[Principal Hawkins]
Well, they each had a bite.
- Ooh, what'd you do?
- [Principal Hawkins] Yeah, a big bite.
I appreciate it. Bye-bye.
[Dee Dee chuckles softly]
Am I interrupting something?
{\an8}I was just doing some research,
{\an8}trying to figure out
if urinal cakes are poisonous.
- Uh, how can I help you?
- [chuckles softly]
Well, I've just been wandering
around town all day.
[chuckles]
I've seen the… sight. [chuckles softly]
And, um…
Bottom line is I just thought
you might want to take me to dinner
and worship me again. [chuckles]
No, I would not like to do that.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.
Okay, what's going on here?
Why is everybody always so mad at me?
Well, speaking for myself,
it's because you're an opportunist.
You came here for publicity.
You're a terrible person.
No, no. Nobody gets to
talk to me that way. Nobody!
You know, meeting you in person
has been colossally disappointing.
[scoffs]
I wanted you to be Dolores.
Who the hell is Dolores?
From Swallow the Moon.
[audience applauding]
[Principal Hawkins] She was joyful.
She was full of courage and hope.
- Okay, but she was fictional.
- But you made her real.
When you sang
"The Lady's Improving" to Troy Gibson,
you were admitting you weren't perfect
and you knew you could be better,
and that's why
he didn't fire you from the circus act.
Such humility and dignity.
- That's who I thought you were.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm not Dolores.
I'm just a really, really,
really good actress. And you…
You're just some hick town
high school teacher
who can't even tell the difference
between fantasy and reality.
- Are we done?
- Oh, yeah, we're done.

What are we?
- No, you know what we are.

Do you know what it was like
standing there in that stupid dress
alone in the gym,
knowing that people got together
and planned the best way to hurt me?
- That must've been awful.
- It was.
But the worst part…
The worst part was that you didn't come
even though you knew what happened.
You didn't come and try and hold my hand
or take me out of there.
- I couldn't, okay?
- Why?
You know what my mother is like.

Was I put her interest ahead of my own.

- I expect nothing in return.
I have no agenda
other than to ease someone else's burden.
Oh, Dee Dee,
that is incredibly generous of you!
I know! [laughing]

Fifteen, sixteen million!
- Dee Dee! You saved the day!

I'm so happy to be able to help.
And I'm gonna take a stand.
And I want to thank you all

and I spent a lot of time

So I wrote a song

I've never been more proud.
- So when is the prom?
- There's no money left.
- What? What do you mean?
- We already had a prom, remember?
[Angie groans]
[Principal Hawkins]
There could be a miracle. It's early.
[Barry sighs]
Okay, people,
it's Mickey and Judy time. Okay?
This is the part
where we roll up our sleeves
and we put on a prom
with our own bare hands.
- We are giving Emma the prom she deserves.
- Okay, wait a minute.
How much are we talking about?
What does a prom cost?
[sputters]
I mean,
it's not a school-sanctioned event,
so we have to pay
a rental fee on the gym.
DJ.
- Lighting.
- Sound system.
[Principal Hawkins]
It's still thousands of dollars.
Right. Um…
Okay, here.
Charge that until it declines,
which will be soon.
I had to declare bankruptcy
after my self-produced Notes on a Scandal.
[Angie] Yes. Well…
I don't have a credit card anymore
because I…
Well, I just… [exhales]
But, anyway, you can have what I have
in my Venmo and there's my cash.
It's all yours.
- Thanks, Angie. [chuckles]
- Sure.
Okay. This is my card
from the Actors Federal Credit Union.
Just cross your fingers and swipe.
All right. Well, we're making
some progress here. This is a nice start.
Um…
{\an8}- We still have a long way to go.
- [Angie] Mmm-hmm.
[Angie clears throat]

Oh, come on. I know you've got

There's no limit on that baby.
Please, please, no.
I already gave a house.
Exactly, so this is nothing. Come on.
[seductively] Eleanor.
Franklin.
[sighs]
[dramatically] Why does being good
cost so much… money?
[all chuckling]
- Well done, Dee Dee.
- [chuckles]
- [Trent] Yes!
- We're fully financed.
- [Trent] Yeah!
- Okay, well, let's give this girl a prom!
- Yes!
- [Barry] Okay, let's do it!
[Trent] The students will want to see us
perform some sort of number.
So, look, I…
I've been thinking hard about this.
[Barry] Mmm.
That thing
that you and I were talking about.
- I called your mother.
- What?
Yeah, I found her number in your phone.
How did you know my passcode?
Well, I guessed. 9481. Beyoncé's birthday.
[chuckling] Got it on the first try.
- Well, why would you do that?
- Because, Barry…
- I know you couldn't do it on your own.
- What did she say?
Well, I think
maybe you should let her tell you that.
[Vera] Hi, Barry.
Okay. I'm gonna give you some space,
and I'll be in the faculty lounge, okay?
No. No, you…
You don't get to do this. Okay?
You don't get to show up
out of nowhere. Okay? No. Uh-uh.
I came all this way, Barry.
Well, you can just turn around
and go right back, okay?
You called me, didn't you?
That was you who called
and hung up, wasn't it?
[sighs]
I handled this all wrong, honey.
And I'm so sorry.
Okay. You just… stay…
When you told us what you were,
who you were,
your father and I, we were scared.
We hardly knew what gay meant.
We both thought
that somehow we had failed you,
like maybe it was our fault.
- So it's okay now?
- [sighs]
What I needed was a mother
who didn't know if it was okay
but loved me anyway.
You think you were scared?
How do you think I felt?
[sobbing] I know, Barry.
I failed you and I know.
That's gonna be on my heart
till the day I die.
[voice breaking] But all I can say is
I was wrong and I'm sorry.
What about Dad? Is he here?
Uh, no. He's just not…
He's not there yet.
I'm sorry to say.
Oh, Barry.
Please forgive me.
I've missed you so much.
[crying] I missed you too.
I did.
I missed you too. I missed you.
[both sobbing]
♪ Then you came along
And right or wrong… ♪
- Aren't you tired of watching that?
- Eight million people have seen it.
I just don't understand it.
Well, I think it's brave.
[sighs]
The kids are saying
there's gonna be another prom.
- [scoffs]
- Someone's offered to pay for it.
Who?
This is so generous of you guys.
We had to do something
after you broke the Internet.
It was crazy.
The numbers just kept going up,
and then the Indiana Star called,
and then the Washington Post...
Hello, everyone.
Can't have a prom without flowers.
So I will put these out on the table,
even though I'd rather just
give them all to you.
- [Angie] Oh, my God!
- [Barry] Is this for real?
Can I just say you guys are
the best middle-aged people I've ever met.
[exhales]
That is…
Oh, honey…
We need to talk to you
about something, okay? And I think it's…
It's important that you understand
the real reason
why we came here to visit you.
- It wasn't for the Hoosier pie?
- [chuckles]
Well, I mean, um…
- We were in a show.
- A wonderful show.
Well, I mean…
[hesitating]
And we got blasted by the critics.
They called us narcissists, and it hurt.
And it hurt
because I guess they were right.
So we looked around for a cause
that might give us some credibility.
[chuckling] Maybe get us some good press.
Like building
a house for Habitat for Humanity.
Then we realized that
we're not capable of building anything.
And then I found you on Twitter.
I mean, it was just dumb luck,
but meant to be.
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, but…
You're going to build something.
- You're going to build a prom.
- [all chuckling]
Stop it! Stop this, please!
Who gave you people
permission to be in here?
- I did.
- You should have consulted with the PTA.
Well, this is not a school event, so
I'm not obliged to get the PTA's approval.
I'm going to be
as clear as I possibly can.
Your beliefs are not our beliefs.
Hey, Emma. Can we talk to you?
I was a jerk, and I'm sorry.
You deserve to go to prom
just like any other kid.
What? I thought you hated me.
I thought you all hated me.
Oh, they hated you.
They hated you with a burning passion
stoked by centuries of intolerance
and the lack of a drama program.
I'm sorry, too, Emma.
You know, you explain things really well.
You should be, like, a teacher.
- Oh, you should be our drama teacher!
- [girl] Yes, please!
You should do it. Do it.
- You're hired!
- I'm a teacher!
- As a temp.
- Absolutely.
No, no, no! This is...
This is what I was afraid of.
- Mom!
- Let me finish!
No, you have got to stop talking
and just listen, okay?
People don't turn gay.
They are who they are.
No. You don't know what you're saying.
I do.
I do.
Look, I know how you were raised,
but… the world's a different place.
And sure, it's not great, but…
It's… it's better because of people
who have the courage to be who they are.
People like her.
[sighs]
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I just want to be me.
[crying]
So here goes.
- I love you, Emma Nolan.
- Oh, my God.
[all squeal and chuckle]
I love you too.
Alyssa… No, listen to me.
You are very young and you are confused.
You don't know what is…
[voice breaking]
I just don't want you to have a hard life.
It's already hard.
- Mom, I love you...
- No. [shushes]
We'll… [breathing shakily]
We can talk about this tonight.
Okay? Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.
Mom…
[door opens]
[crying]
[door shuts]
- [Emma whispers] Just breathe.
- Hey, why don't we decorate?
Yes, let's decorate.
Let's decorate everything.
- [Trent] All right.
- [Sheldon] I need you here.
[Dee Dee] We're gonna
make this place really pretty.
[Emma gasps]
Look at that!
I'm so proud of you. Look at what you did.
I can't believe this.
- [Emma gasps]
- [Alyssa] I think we're early.
- Yeah, it looks like it.
- Mm-hmm.
You want to hit up the punch bowl?
No. There's only one thing
