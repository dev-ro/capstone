It was silly. Some at school

Frankenstein was a top scientist.
T m  goes badly.
Tsempa, Liam.
The house is solid.
As you know.
I would say that this is a Victorian one
a classic haunted house.
Not what Frankenstein did.
Hi, I'm Liam.
Strong and quiet. Tykkn.
And pink hair is awesome.
Do I have one free horticulture?
Was that enough?
It should be.
This starts already from the home.

Stay calm, man.
No reason for the game.
I did not believe it.

It is frightening.
It was hard enough to snoop.

Lie down on the gnomes.

We want the keystone right away!
Or we can not close portals.
If the keystone is not present,
there is darkness over creation.
Darkness or death.

Are we gonna take you to the jetty?

I do not know what that means.
We're protecting you from trogge.
What are the trogues?
- You met one yesterday.
They are small and py reit ,
spread teeth. Every time you do it.
That was true.
- You saved the house nicely.
Only the keystone est   niit  
to take over the world.
Without having to sit down.
- Take that keystone back.
It is stored in my cabinet
at school. I'll get it.
If the trogues are unleashed, -
we get to the darkness for a thousand years.
My phone!
It goes to the basement.
Take the Air Arms. Hurry up!
Did not you release me?

No, I do not trust you.

Gnoomit!
We thought we were tripping
had become a duo.
As I said, they lost.
Beware, bark. We've been handling it
you bigger daddy too.
Interestingly,
but I have a bansankoe.
Nobody goes to anything.
- Let's get it the key word.
I can help!
- I do not trust what you compare.
Get the keystone from school.
Then you get your boyfriend.
Dental floss!
Beware, Liam.
The little ones are k rttyisi .
But you did it from school.
- I like the school.
Hey, girls.
- Do you know the hours?
It is necessary to use the entire p iv .
- Great.
I'm embarrassed, but I need it
its jewel back.
Good joke, UT.
- Real fun, B.
I'm serious.
It's home.
- I'll be back soon.
Necklace is no problem.
Will you put it on the party?
Come on yoga with me.
- Yeah, that's interesting.
T m  was t ss .
Hello? Liam?
Little Santa Claus?
Chloe? You came back!
- How did you ... Mist  you got ...
Liam?
- See what the airbag is.
The gnoms have stolen
for many years.
We spoke clearly.
Miss  is the keystone?
We got two troggia.
And I almost got it.
Miss  is the keystone?
- There was a small problem.
I loaned it to Brittany.
I'll get it after the party.
You guys are good at home!
- Our rescuer is back.
I will return the keystone right away.
He borrowed it to the girl,
which does not return sit.
Forget all my compliments.
- I'm sorry, I'm new.
I wanted yst vi . Brittany
wanted to borrow it. It's cool.
Wait a minute. You borrowed the keystone,
because you wanted yst vi ?
So. Past!
No! I do not feel like people.
If they do not care, let's go.
Enter the house.
Min  h ivyn. Adios!
Wait. I can not do it.
- Good y t .
Gesundheit! Auf Wiedersehen!
In the closet.
No.
No.
No.
- Juhuu!
How does that make it?
Are they three?
- Four.
Red alarm.
Perntyk!
Everything inside. My s Pink.
I knew it.
T m  is the Frankenstein Castle.
Mit  now?
Watch the portals.
- Locking with trogues?
A really good plan.
- You did not bring the keystone.
No one will come or leave
before the situation is clear.
My pit pst party.
A quick question.
Why are trogs t  ll ?
Simplify my son.
To destroy you.
Years ago,
long before human time, -
we got the gnomes from this country
green and flourishing.
Then er  n  synkk n  p iv n  
troggit hy kk siv t.
With a magical crystal
they opened the portal-
and vy ryiv t our world.
Niist  came to our bloodguilt.
We the gnomes we created el m  ,
trogues destroyed the sit.
Those booby babies are banging everything.
We were running our trojans with our trojans
back to their dimension.
Then someone jerked a man
built the house of the house-
just in the place,
from where they appeared.
At the intersection of time and space.
Our world-wide portal.
- V litt j  did not mention sit .
We were able to estimate the key lever
the opening of portals
and protect yourself from destruction.
The six of us sworn,
we protect the house if ...
If mit ?
- I do not know.
If there is a girl
makes a keychain of a necklace-
and give it to the girl,
which is h nest  cool.
I did not ask t t .
I did not want to change it.
I hate to house you.
The portal opens in sector R4.
- In the basement again.
Dimensions in width?
Sairasta. Beware.
Everything that is in his mouth,
go there forever.
Is he in good shape?
Now we have six,
but originally seventh.
Who is missing?
- Zamfeer.
Our leaders. H n left alone
the troggia of the world's uumen-
to ultimately destroy it.
H n never came back.
The key is to get back.
- Liam is right.
My pit party PST
to pick up the keystone.
Because of the keystone,
not for the party.
Purge unlocking.
Go get the keystone.
We will not be locked up again,
but we like them ...
What are you doing?
- Mit ?
Mit  t m  file is? I do not know.
How does it work? Not a clue.
Mist  it comes? T st  from the plant.
Meill  is just a file created by it.
Who knows, when does it end?
When it finishes ...
...it ends.
The plant smells bad.
- I take the honor of the tide.
The operation becomes bleeding.
Air around.
Do not stay afloat.
- Talking about a good gnoom.
Loading. Ready, Pink?
Pink!
- Sorry, I'm writing to Brit.
How long will it last?
There are three hours for the bills.
I did not even know what to do next.
I got one!
- Yeah!
Pull me up!
Beat the stuff.
Chloe!
Well done, Pink.
- Thank you.
Sin  and Liam are a good team.
You're probably good.
We're not yst vi .
Really.
Sorry, I look at the messages.
I hate that gadget.
- It's the 19th hour to the party.
It's been a long time.
- Are you ready for the party?
I'll be back soon.
- I handle this. Let's go.
Kappas. About sit  pit  .
In the floating basement.
Do you usually protect?
Sorry, pit   prepare.
- We're looking for a keystone.
Min  I get a keystone, alone.
We threw trogge properly.
We are definitely a good team.
You have a boiler p  ss .
- Thank you.
Do you need help here?
- Do it alone.
I meet BTC.
They're not yours.
Is this a matter of BTC?
or Treyst?
How come?
- BTC's are not the right thing to do.
What did you know about yst vist ?
Your grandmother is the only one you love.
It is not true.
Grandma is not stupid.
I have not had the right yst v  .
Hardly anymore.
It's good, Liam.
I do not have the right yst vi .
  iti and min  are changed all the time.
I do not have time to get to know each other.
I did not know.
- Now you know.
No h t  . Min  p rj  n.
We try to fight trogues.
Lime enough for a couple of hours.
Come on in nine.
Nine? Selv.
- And Pink.
We wanted to say,
even though you are a human being,
you've got the correct n tilt .
Thank you!
And ... that's the keystone!
You can trust me.

Let's hope.
Now it is.

Zook k ski will follow you.

I do not need anybody's help.
- UT!
There they are.
Time is ticking.
Was that a code word?
"Get the keystone."
Do you want to bring yours to you?
- That?
Sometimes it's hard to be cool.
- You do not have a necklace.
No, it did not fit in.
- Thank God.
That necklace and those kangos?
- Selfie.
Share it.
Searching after parties
it's a necklace. I am sorry.
Hey.
Yeah ... Trey.
Like "real" in French.
Was it French?
- Like "tr s bien".
I can not speak french.

A good example of French people,
French pastries and pastiles.
So, food?
- Yeah, the food is good.
I think so too.
Food is good.

Let me guess. You did not get sit?

Could it be worse to go?
Liam!
New girl, you're together.
- I want my necklace now.
Relax. Is he really serious about it?
I borrowed a jewel because I thought,
that we could be yst vi .
I do not want yst v  .
- I would not sit, even if I could.
What does that mean?
- I threw it away. It was ugly.
I throw my neck off?
Liam was right about you.
- And what was I doing for you?
You are a loser like
luuseri poikayst v sikin.

Zook! Zook! Friends!
Open the door! Open up!

You should have fun

Nice that you've got

Quickly.
You are dear.

Doors shut!
Pink.
- I made a terrible mistake.
You did not get the keystone,
but now there is a bigger problem.
MissÂ Liam is it?
The portal opened.
We did not go to hitch.
I'm going to sleep.
Hello?

Time to rinse.

This should be a portal.

I'll go.
You're really brave, Chloe.
Stupid, but brave.
I'll be back soon.

Hello?
Liam? Miss  are you?
Woohoo!
Oh no.
Wow.

I thought that too, I'll

You would have kept listening to you.
You were right about everything.
I really liked yst vi .
I did not realize that I already had.
I know you hate me.
It was horrible.
Sorry.
I'm trying to say ...
Would you like to ya? Again?
Of course, Chloe.
I will never weep.
Or maybe sometime.
- Not that.
I am at this.
We have to go away from the t  lt .
- Not a Combat Captain.
We can not redeem heroes ...
What was that?
Zamfeer!
Zamfeer? Are you sin?
It tries to communicate.
- What do you mean?
Maybe he can not talk.
- At least you can smell it.
Cancel! T m  flute is a gun!
Be careful or t  lt  wash!
Sinby you can talk. I'm Chloe.
It's yummy Liam.
We have to keep the p  st  out of t  lt .
Can you help me?
Off!
- Liam, come on! Suddenly!
Remember: I have a gun.
Sin  really smells.
- How would you do it?
I gave the keystone to Zook,
so that the portal would not open.
Yes, the answer.
You're not real.
The eyes are open. Yh  t  ll !
- The key word is gone.
Then troggit heròÀÙs soon
and swallowed us.
Can take good luck!
What was that?
- Megatrogg.
Did you say megatrogg?
The hearing went!
- Do you hear me now?
That's megatrogg.
Made up of all the trogues
evil association.
Time for many troggia.
- It's about everything and everything.
What did not stop?
- I got something.
Calm down. Of course
we can do something. Always can.
Lima ran out.
- Same t  ll .
Troggit does not end.
- Vet ytyk  !
Close formation.
That is the crystal display.
- Like Quicksilver's story.
If we get that piece,
we can replace the keystone.
Slide, long legs.
Ent  sin ?
- Now!
Your phone!
This may be a solution.
The Lord forbid!
Help!
- T m  is doing.
I figured out the plan.
Sin  really smelly.
I threw myself into a troy's pocket.
Overwhelmed by the smell.
Remember how the keystone glittered
when did you give your phone to Brittany?
Brittany was a bad yst v  ...
- The battery is lithium.
Make a big difference in energy
nearby. Crystal is energy.
You got a good idea. I can break ...
Stop!
That's the portal!
Tydellist. If the battery
reacts with the crystal, -
lithium-peroxide rush
can destroy the entire trouca world!
Thicker than min.
- Wait a minute. Come on!
No, if we tie our way
with ratsuvs. That's it.
Well, kids.
Hyp tk   aboard.
Drop the battery!
Pit k   closed!

Herttileijaa!
Liam! Chloe!
No water.
Zamfeer! Attention.
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Quicksilver.
I forgot your name, but I missed you.
I lost the keystone
and the end of the storage box ...
Rest. I'll show you
new stuff.
Chloe and Liam.
We are already known.
- Get involved.
They helped destroy
the troggy of the world finally.
No more trogge.
I would have come ...
- Zook. I was long gone.
I studied the flute playing
and I mess with myself, -
but one thing gave strength to everything.
I knew the best thing to do
take care of the gnoomiveljist  t  ll .
We can finally build a garden!
I am a new TyTN at home
the Frankenstein Castle.
Is that yours?
- No, it lives in a pink box.
You shave.
What are you doing?
- Anybody talking?
No, just some loser
and her belly boy boy.
Not good, UT.
No one is rejecting BTCs.
Min  p  t n, are we yst vi .
- You do not even understand the whole word.
As soon as someone gets older,
those who reject you.
Well, look at what's wrong.
I'm gonna give it to my cat.
I do not need to sit.
- Min  m  r  n t  ll .
What was that?
Did we destroy the trophy world?
- Yeah, unless ...
Unless Mitz?
Sinby you tricked me.
Everything you said ...
Clothes, hair.
You're just jealous...
Brittany ...

Gnoomeja? Gnoomeja!
Pocket, pull the hammer off.
T m  is just a dream.
We're trapped.

Gotcha!

You can do that, Chloe!

I apologize for everything!
Almost everything. Help!

What happened?
I'm just about to sleep.
Chloe?
Are you okay?
Please, I want you to go.

I mean, put it in the house.
It's nice to be here.
