You are all in good health
but you cannot imagine
the supreme happiness
an epileptic feels
in the moments before a fit.
﻿I would give perhaps my whole life
in exchange for a few
seconds of that felicity.
You are about to see old
images of the Middle Ages.
The big witch hunt
we will discuss
is one of the major
catastrophes in man's history.
﻿To try and understand it,
﻿we must bear in mind
﻿that it took place
﻿in a dark age of our history
﻿both spiritually and materially.
﻿The genuine fear of Hell
weighed constantly on
people's minds.
﻿Let's take a look at the women
﻿burned at the stake.
We filmmakers have a
big responsibility.
﻿It is up to us to raise the film
﻿from an industry to an art form.
﻿Save me from the stake, or else.
﻿Burn the witch
﻿You will go with the Devil.
﻿Hypocrite!
﻿Liar!
To make the wonderful
image in "DAY OF WRATH
of the witch who
lands on the bonfire.
The actress was on top of her
ladder for two hours.
﻿It's no wonder her face
﻿bore a real expression of horror.
﻿Can we stop that hell?
﻿Have you been burned at the stake?
- Like we'll do later...
- No.
- It's classy.
- Yeah?
- Have you?
- Oh, sure. I think it rocks.
It's so chic.
You're queen of the village.
It's true!
It's then or never.
Either you've been a beauty queen
or burned at the stake.
So...
since I've never been Miss France,
sometime I say I'm Miss Dreux.
Miss Dreux is chic.
KINGDOM OF FRANCE - MMXIX
But the most beautiful death...
the most...
is Christ.
You know I go to church,
you believe or not, up to you.
I respect people, who cares.
But it's pretty classy!
Really...
Whoever scripted the Passion...
Oh yeah.
We learned a new word today:
"Sexocide".
Sexocide: the genocide of witches.
Because they're women.
Did you... let's see your ears.
Do you have it? Fuck!
We've got the sign of the witch.
That too, you know...
Having your earlobe cut,
was a sign of recognition
for witches.
Outside, easy to see.
Women got burned for that.
You don't have it.
But you do have pierced ears.
I'm Top Witch!
Fuck!
Redheads, witches...
And that too...
One thing was really horrible was
when I played a witch.
To check you were really a witch,
they dunked you in water
If you drowned,
you weren't a witch.
So we did that.
Except the witches were naked...
and you're filming in an Italian
village with loads of guys,
dressed Medieval to look the part,
because that's when the film was set.
You climb a mountain naked.
With 2,000 guys there.
I swear.
I'd say it's the worst
memory of my life.
You've got 2,000 guys scoping you naked.
Climbing! Not posing.
You're climbing, in crappy positions...
looking ridiculous and baring all.
I'd be happy to climb
if I had your body.
Oh, fuck!
The film is beautiful, so it's okay.
But when you're doing it...
The end justifies the means.
It's okay.
Really!
I've worked with guys...
where I'm been told he's a prick.
I'm not looking to make friends.
I don't give a shit.
Some directors are pricks.
If he's really cool, it's a plus.
But it's no big deal.
If he takes me on his trip on screen...
Know what I like best?
When you don't question.
Something totally unlikely happens,
you can't explain it...
and you don't try to.
You don't ask why.
It runs deeper than that,
the guy takes you on his trip,
into his mind, his brain.
The actor? Or the director?
- The director?
- Yes.
I personally...
That's it.
I'm not criticising.
People make movies...
or watch them for what
they get out of them.
Fuck entertainment movies!
They bore me.
But if people like them,
who am I to say they're crap?
I need to get inspired
or carried away...
It's like drugs. Or...
Why am I comparing it to drugs?
See?
Sometimes I talk so much
it drives me nuts.
No, it's better.
Honestly! Imagine if I was taking
fucking speed...
What I wanted to say...
When I arrive in paradise
and my Lord and Master is there...
You think that?
You're a real believer?
Oh, yes.
- I don't believe in anything.
- Oh, I do. Yes, I do!
Jesus? I've been doing
deals with him all my life.
I swear!
I say: c'mon, if I do this,
it'll be okay?
And since he's never answered,
I say it's cool.
Did Jesus speak?
"Don't do it, don't take that shit!"
- He said nothing.
- He won't like the film you're making.
The day he says "you're screwing up!"
I won't do it.
But the day I arrived in Paradise
and my Lord and Master is there.
In the afternoon He'll say that I
spent my life talking about Him,
hyping Him up.
I'm like his agent.
He comes to meet me at the gates.
He'll take care of me.
He'll teach me tons.
Loads. It'll be great.
﻿Most filmmakers today
are like the living dead
﻿and their films are just like them.
The bonfire scene will look beautiful.
Yes.
Have you ever
burned at the stake?
No, not at the stake,
but I've burned...
...in a tent.
That is so un-cool!
- It looked great!
- I'm sure.
- It's the way you said it.
- Under branches...
I'm sure it was beautiful.
Everything you do is beautiful.
No, no, but...
In any case, it was...
Yes, I burned.
- But not at the stake.
- I've never seen you in anything tacky.
- Sure, I've done loads.
- Maybe...
- I don't remember that.
- Not at the stake. Have you?
But the ridiculous thing was...
the producer was there
and I'm on the stake, with the wool
robe and my hair chopped...
Super sexy.
Bonfires are super sexy.
It ends badly but it's super cool.
You're on a donkey.
Hopping with fleas but so cute!
I swear!
You go through the village,
everyone points...
It's so sexy!
When you get to the bonfire,
the producer comes up
and he doesn't find it sexy.
The wool robe... with no lingerie...
it didn't suit the scene.
He takes something to cut it.
A blade or knife or whatever.
And he slits it open here,
and on the thigh.
- I say "you've lost the plot!".
- No shit?
I remember a film with a really
pretty actress in the 1950s,
where she falls and her dress opens.
You see her garter belt,
she's posing.
Nobody falls into a perfect pose!
It was funny.
But on a bonfire?
Showing a...
It wasn't the director,
he wasn't a prick.
It was the producer,
a total stereotype.
The Italian producer who wants it sexy.
Totally "woman"... Weird.
So bizarre. But it's a good film
so who cares.
- No, I've never seen you in shit films.
- Oh, sure, I've done loads.
It's like the ugly guy...
There's always one,
when you list who you've scored,
you list the hunks.
Or not just the hunks,
the class acts.
There's always a loser
you leave out.
We all have one.
A loser you leave out.
Or the guy who gives
you the creeps...
There's always a
dead rat somewhere!
I had one who wasn't a creep.
Poor guy, he was real cute
but so young.
I was older than him.
And...
it was the end of the film,
we had to...
get together.
And... he ejaculated on my leg
For real!
But it didn't creep me out.
- He was moved!
- Poor guy, he was so young.
- How old? 16?
- Yes.
Six years too old for that to happen!
That happened to me
in a move theatre,
- I was with friends...
- Gross!
Vile.
There were loads of people...
How did it happen?
We were waiting in line. I must have
been touching the guy, jeez!
- Like you didn't know!
- No, honestly.
I'm with my punk pals...
We go in and as I walk by
I feel something on my leg.
Right then, you can't imagine it.
You don't get it.
Then I realise.
I was with a hardcore punk.
He bust the creep's brains!
I said "Dude, you behaved badly.
You're gonna regret it".
Seriously.
Ah, no!
Me, I practically apologised.
You're nuts!
Fuck!
- He must have felt bad.
- He was very embarrassed.
So you were naked,
for you to realise?
- Slightly undressed?
- We were totally naked!
Under the sheets!
After, the director told him he should
have jerked off beforehand.
It's no big deal.
But I guess he...
Oh boy!
I've had love scenes where
the set designers...
I remember once in Miami...
A love scene,
you've done the scene
and God knows why,
the set designers insist on taking
their sheets and pillows right then,
when you're butt-naked.
You're not some porn actor,
all relaxed.
Generally, you're not relaxed
on set being naked...
None of that here?
No!
We didn't tell you about the
gangbang scene?
We kept it as a surprise!
No, my dear, I won't pull
surprises like that.
Hey presto! A hardcore
porn scene.
I keep banging on,
maybe you want to rest up?
- Concentrate.
- No, but...
- When do we start?
- Now. When everyone's ready.
You'll go to makeup to get prepped.
The crew's cool, you'll see.
But then there's Tic and Tac.
They're my ball and chain.
Fagin and Scrooge.
The producers, you'll see!
Stereotypical pricks.
- They're here?
- All the time.
All the time! Everywhere I look,
they're in my frame.
Like a curse.
Nobody sees them.
But I do, everywhere.
They do my head in.
- Can you do what you like or not?
- They have no choice.
They can't force anything on me.
They've signed the contract.
Like I say: "you wanted me,
you got me!"
Deal with it.
I'm a nice person. I've got a big
mouth, whatever...
But I'm nice.
I respect people.
But if you piss me off...
It all vanishes. All of it.
﻿Ok, babe?
﻿You busy?
﻿I won’t answer that.
﻿If it's the...
﻿tiebreaker.
﻿Don’t push it!
﻿I have a friend from L.A. here.
﻿Say that again, sweetie!
﻿I love it, "from L. A".
﻿From Los Angeles.
﻿I got it, I’m not dumb.
﻿He's flown over,
an 8 or 9 hour flight...
﻿He'll see us tomorrow.
﻿He'll still want to.
﻿They say they're busy.
﻿Hello.
﻿I’m Karl.
﻿Why me?
﻿You’re a prick-magnet!
﻿- He's my bro’!
- ﻿Are you good?
﻿Bad timing.
﻿It’s really nice to meet you.
﻿You know Beatrice?
﻿Beatrice!
﻿Can we start?
Clara? Can you take care
﻿of Charlotte?
﻿Please, we don’t
need to talk to him now.
﻿We're ready.
﻿Right behind you.
﻿What are you doing?
I follow you?
﻿- Yes. please.
﻿Who’s that guy?
﻿- No idea.
﻿Check out the L.A. loser!
﻿And who’s this?
﻿Mica, the construction manager.
Hi, Mica!
﻿He seems happy...
﻿So, for the next scene...
﻿we go straight in...
﻿to reassure them.
﻿a rehearsal with everyone.
﻿I hear you, Maxime.
But there's a problem:
﻿you're committed.
﻿Yannick.
I wouldn't be funding this
﻿if you weren’t here.
﻿Tell me you didn’t know.
﻿We know she's an actress.
﻿You knew!
It's her first film.
﻿You've worked with losers.
You drove them.
﻿I won’t name names.
You've worked with greats
﻿but also with losers.
﻿This one’s a loser.
﻿No!
﻿Listen...
﻿If you knew, it’s bad.
﻿If you knew, it’s bad.
﻿Bad for the film.
﻿Bad for the crew.
﻿Bad for me.
﻿It makes me sick.
﻿Sick!
﻿You need to take a step back.
﻿We're a bit late.
We can catch up.
No! ﻿It's more than a bit.
﻿- I’m counting on you.
It's more than a bit.
﻿It’s a fucking catastrophe.
﻿Listen, of course it’s a catastrophe
﻿I’ve pumped 80% of my cash into this.
﻿Béatrice Dalle is a name.
Right now you’re nobody, ok?
﻿So you’ll do her movie.
﻿I’m asking you to do it, ok?
﻿You do the movie.
﻿You don't listen to her.
﻿You make the decisions.
You're not the DP,
﻿you're the director, ok?
﻿You’re in the driving seat.
﻿Ok, I’m the driver.
﻿Can you fire her or not?
﻿It's very complicated.
There’s a contract.
﻿But I can try to fire her.
I'll call my attorney.
﻿We’ll see.
﻿Or...
﻿This might be crazy, but it’s an idea.
﻿Lola, where's Tom?
I want to talk to him.
﻿He’s right here.
﻿Here, boss!
﻿Talk.
You know Victor Hugo's poem,
﻿"The Conscience”?
﻿The eye was in the grave,
looking at Cain.
﻿I want you to be my eye.
﻿I want you to follow Beatrice
﻿day and night, to the john
if need be, with your camera
﻿and film her every move.
I'll ﻿find a mistake.
﻿And fire her for it.
﻿Perfect, got it.
- Got it?
- Okay.
﻿We ll watch the footage every evening.
﻿Thanks.
﻿See? We’ll be ok!
﻿You’ll take over if I fire her?
﻿- But I...
﻿Max? ﻿Max? Deal.
﻿I don't know...
﻿- Max?
I don't know.
﻿Honestly, no...
﻿Thanks, Max
Where did you get this assistant?
She sucks.
You wanted an amateur crew.
She's a waste of space.
Pretty but useless.
It's your DP who sucks!
I could stick his zoom up his ass!
Wait until we've wrapped.
He's 60 and can't light shit.
Professional my arse.
You got cash?
The pharmacist's here.
- He's got the sedative.
- Take the money from my purse.
- I'm doing it for you.
- I know. Let's roll!
Let's burn some witches.
We start soon.
See you over there.
Yes. Coming.
Seriously...
Back to hell.
Time to get moving
and do a run-through.
Everyone listen, please!
Felix, you translate.
I'd just like to say to
my princesses that...
if they have a question
or want any directions,
if they want reassurance,
or need my advice,
I'm here for them now.
So they can ask any questions.
- What kind of makeup?
- I want her to feel good.
So ask her how she wants her makeup,
how she feels beautiful.
I need her to feel strong
and reassured.
So ask her, okay?
Béatrice?
Can you come here?
﻿Yes, Judas.
﻿So what’s the problem here?
﻿No problem, we're debriefing.
﻿Don't be paranoid.
﻿I'm not. I’m asking a question
﻿calmly and politely,
so answer me the same way.
﻿It’s not calm or polite.
﻿- Max! Respect...
﻿- What did I say?
﻿Max, what did I ask?
﻿You're here to supervise Béatrice.
You're her DP...
﻿I can’t stand it.
﻿- If you can't stand it, leave. Ok?
﻿I can’t stand it either but I shut up.
We'll talk over here,
﻿we're heading for disaster.
﻿Not now!
﻿We're heading for disaster.
﻿You need to wind down.
﻿Disaster?
I’ve been waiting hours!
Asking for rehearsals,
﻿places to meet and talk.
﻿And I keep being told to wait.
﻿And this DP who...
﻿Calm down!
What?
﻿I'll calm down if I want!
﻿Calm down!
﻿Why the hysterics?
﻿Not now!
﻿And you!
What is this? Cannes?
Taking photos!
﻿Stop!
Okay.
﻿Can someone got to the dressing room
to check on Charlotte? She'll leave!
And she'll be right.
Charlotte, we're almost ready.
- At Cannes, you'll kiss my arse!
- You'll never be at Cannes!
I am Cannes!
- Go produce your ham ads!
- My ham ads pay for this film!
Clara, can you take
Fanny on set?
﻿Felix!
Handle this.
﻿I want a rehearsal now.
- Béatrice?
- What?
﻿I alone believed in your project.
﻿And you're grossly ungrateful
﻿You’re not involved!
﻿I’m waiting for hair and makeup...
You want me on set
﻿when they’re not ready?
﻿You don't respect me
or the project!
﻿Be respectable to earn my respect!
﻿Wait, babe...
﻿- This is not the time!
﻿It’s never time.
I'm working.
﻿And for you it's never time!
Are they ready?
﻿Paul, please...
﻿We need some privacy.
﻿You need privacy? Everyone out!
﻿Everyone who’s not needed please leave.
﻿Is she ready?
﻿- I just started her hydration.
﻿Hydration?
Fucking jargon.
Don't you start!
Seriously!
Crazy bitch!
Béa, you're a fraud!
It's a status, at least!
- Just 5 minutes?
- You can finish on set.
On set? We can't!
- I know my job, okay?
- But you're still on set.
Can't we get the stand-in?
We're on our way.
About time!
- The camera's ready?
- 5 or 10 minutes.
- 5 or 10 minutes?
- 10 minutes.
Maxime, this is Fanny.
Nice to meet you, Fanny.
Momo?
Can you angle the red lights?
Is this lighting ready?
Can we rehearse?
I won't talk to you now.
Not now, please!
Dumbass, I've said nothing
and bust no-one's balls.
Felix, please!
Handle the stand-in so
he won't bug her.
﻿Launch the sky!
﻿Not blue! The sky for the film.
﻿Who's that bum on Abbey's mark?
﻿The sky for the film, Ernesto!
﻿There, thank you!
﻿All ready, Ahmed?
﻿Ready?
﻿Lighting
﻿Stop fighting! Get moving,
not a single shot is ready!
﻿Shit!
﻿Go find someone!
﻿Hello, I’m from Cinematic Eye magazine.
We met at the Female Film Festival
﻿in Montreuil.
﻿I mean Creteil.
Would it be possible
﻿to get some info...
﻿A few facts and figures on this shoot.
Know what?
﻿Go ask the boss!
﻿He’s running the show.
﻿I don’t want to be a bother.
﻿- But you are!
﻿Extras!
﻿Extras on set now!
﻿Extras on set now, please!
Clara, send the fucking
﻿extras now!
﻿Boy...!
﻿Extras on... Wait!
﻿I’m the boss!
﻿Extras on set!
﻿Get Yannick, please!
﻿I've had it, I’m leaving.
What can I do here?
What is this production?
We've been waiting since 8am!
Fucking union extras!
I'll bust the fucking set!
Béatrice on set!
What can I do?
Extras! Extras on set now!
When do we eat?
We've been here 5 hours!
With no food or drink.
We're not cattle!
Clara! Get sandwiches
for the extras, please!
Keep focused!
I'm an idiot!
Bright and eager!
- Time to go.
- Cool it! We're good.
If you stopped shouting
we'd be ready. What is this?
I'm trying not to shout.
Let's go, she's waiting.
We're bringing the actresses now.
- Béatrice, are you coming?
- No!
Béatrice, come back!
Béatrice! Come out here!
- Béatrice, for fuck's sake!
- Béatrice, I'm so sorry.
I put my foot in it.
I didn't think it'd be a bad time.
Come now or you burn.
Not now! Not now!
I didn't mean to...
Béatrice is coming!
- No way!
- Let's go!
As you know, I started
with Jean-Luc.
So no little nobody is
going to teach me my job.
See?
Jean-Luc was no laugh.
- But here...
- Yeah, you said.
What's happening?
- I don't know.
- Is the focus okay?
- I'm good.
- Okay.
Charlotte, you look...
You look tired today.
Are you doing any facial care?
Like a mineral cure?
I'm not so tired.
Something with aloe Vera
or guarana seed?
To help plump up the skin,
because...
- Just do as I say!
- Crew, listen up!
I want only essential people on set!
No parasites or it'll show on screen.
Béatrice, I got the message.
I'll let the artist work.
But just two points beforehand.
Get your hands off me.
You can sink this movie,
but you can't sink my company.
- You really think now is...
- I've called my attorney.
I've made arrangements.
You'll see.
I'll have the last laugh!
Thank you for being here.
I feel safer, you're fabulous.
- And the eyes?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- No.
- You don't want...
- Nothing! Thank you.
- Charlotte, we're not done!
- We'll finish later.
I apologise for this chaos.
We have a problem.
Me too, soon.
Béatrice is an actress, not a director.
I'll replace her with Max.
It's a secret!
Thanks for being here!
Yes, we're coming.
Hurry up.
I can't walk fast
in these things.
Fanny, don't move!
Hang on, I need to make
a quick call.
- Not now.
- Shall I go back?
No, we're in a hurry.
- You couldn't earlier?
- No, I couldn't!
I need a place where I'm...
alone.
Let's shoot the next one.
Charlotte? Where is she?
Charlotte!
Sorry to bother you...
I know you're about to shoot.
I'm one of your biggest fans.
I'm a journalist.
I just wanted some info
about the shoot.
Please, dad!
We'll do this later.
What to say?
I haven't started...
- Just a minute...
- No, sorry, I can't.
What a pain!
He swore he wouldn't come.
Who are these people?
It's rude.
If you let all these people in...
﻿Be quick or I’ll get shit.
﻿I'll be quick.
﻿- That’s the crafty.
﻿You can.
It's a TV set
﻿but you can go in.
﻿Thanks.
﻿Keep in mind it’s a dreamlike movie!
﻿It's not politics. It’s poetry!
﻿We're making art,
we’re making a film!
﻿Hello?
﻿It's Charlotte.
﻿Hello, madam.
﻿All ok?
﻿Yes, fine.
﻿Is she alright?
﻿I pass her to you...
﻿Ok! Thanks.
﻿Hello, Mommy...
﻿Yes, sweetie. All well?
﻿No, Mommy, not really.
﻿At the canteen...
﻿- What did you say?
﻿School wasn't good.
﻿Why? What’s wrong?
﻿At school today, Paul and Lucas.
﻿made a cross on my too foo.
﻿with a knife.
﻿What?
﻿Are you kidding?
﻿They wanted to do a tattoo
﻿on my foo foo.
﻿When, today?
﻿Yes, at the canteen. At Noon.
﻿But...?
﻿Just a minute!
﻿Be quick!
﻿Pass me the nanny, please.
﻿Pass me.
﻿Hello madam?
﻿- Yes.
﻿My daughter just told me something.
﻿Can you.
﻿Can you check...
﻿Can you undress her and check
﻿that she's not hurt?
What do you mean?
﻿I don’t understand.
﻿She told me something.
﻿I'd like you to look, right now.
﻿You undress her.
﻿- Yes.
﻿You undress her now and look
﻿to see that she’s not hurt.
﻿- Now?
﻿- Yes, now.
Okay. I hang up?
Or stay on line?
﻿No...
﻿I’ll call back in 10 minutes.
﻿Ok.
﻿And you look, ok?
﻿Yes. I’ll call back.
﻿Sorry...
﻿This way.
﻿Not now. No!
﻿I'm not sure...
﻿We can talk in just 2 seconds.
﻿Sorry!
﻿Clara!
Felix, where's Charlotte?
Can someone get her?
Ken will wire your mic.
Careful.
I can sense you're down.
Anything wrong?
Yes.
I think I'll have to go home.
- Because of the shoot?
- No, not the shoot, but...
- Can't you see we're talking?
- Just a moment.
She said two minutes,
so wait, okay?
Jesus! Stop!
Can't you see we're talking?
- You're on me every two minutes!
- It's never the right time.
Fucking hell!
I need to make a call.
Thank you.
What the fuck?
You work for a tabloid or what?
Come here!
I do what I want!
I'm the boss!
What the fuck?
My camera!
﻿It’s Charlotte.
﻿No point leaving a message, but...
﻿can you call me back?
﻿As soon as possible.
﻿I’m worried, so...
﻿Leave me a message.
﻿Leave a message,
even just to say what...
﻿What you saw.
﻿And please tell her.
﻿I'll call back in 15 or 20 minutes.
﻿Tell her I'll be there soon as I can.
﻿The filmmaker is the man
﻿who must leave his signature on a film
﻿intended as a work of art.
﻿Ernesto!
﻿The sky!
﻿You want to burn a witch!
﻿Ready for rehearsal!
﻿Ready for action?
﻿Keep angry!
﻿Rolling! End board
﻿Action. Rehearsal. Extras!
﻿Good. Cut!
﻿Cut!
﻿Can’t you keep rolling a bit longer?
﻿You should say what you want before!
You can't cut after 3 seconds. It's 5!
- Then talk to me. Communicate!
- Can you count to 5?
Instead of bitching from the start.
Then I'd know what you want.
It's only a rehearsal, damnit!
Right! We shoot the next take.
- We shoot this one?
- We shoot this one!
First positions, please.
Extras, more anger!
That was good.
Shades off.
We shoot this take.
Is everyone ready now?
More anger, if possible.
You curse, them, you hate them,
you're torching them, okay?
Evening, Charlotte!
- Are the actresses ready?
- Yes.
Great.
Thanks, girls.
Can I have the music, please?
- Music, please!
- Tie her wrist.
No music, they need 10 minutes.
No music? If there's no rhythm,
don't blame me, okay?
Shoot without music.
Are we ready?
- Sound's rolling.
- First positions, please!
"GOD'S CRAFT"
43a - Take 1 - End Board.
Let's shoot!
All ready?
Music!
Action!
Music, please!
﻿Dolly!
﻿Yes!
﻿Yes, that's beautiful!
Beautiful.
﻿Brilliant.
﻿It's so beautiful!
﻿Beautiful, Charlotte!
﻿Don’t move!
﻿Ahmed
Stick the cross
﻿right on her chest!
﻿Yes!
﻿Charlotte!
﻿Look at God or me!
The stand-in has wrapped.
Nothing works on this movie.
It's a mess!
I've never seen anything like it.
Have you seen Béatrice, "directress"?
You're gonna burn, guys!
Charlotte, look at me.
Yes, that's good!
Higher with the cross!
For Christ's sake,
stay in position!
- It's not meant for her.
- Stop moving!
Can you help her, please,
instead of just standing there?
Put her shoes on. Action!
You catch on fast.
You're fitting right in
with this god-awful shoot!
You're getting foul breath,
just like the others.
﻿Cut!
﻿Shut up!
﻿We don't cut!
﻿I'm shooting. Fuck!
﻿When the pressure gets too strong
﻿I turn into a dictator.
Max!
What's that?
Ernesto! What the fuck are you
doing with the lights?
What the hell's going on?
DP! What's happening?
What is this shit?
What's going on?
Don't worry, Charlotte.
They're fixing the lights!
What is this shoot?
You're all fucking useless!
Fuck!
What the hell?
Tell me what's going on,
Mr. Know It All!
What is this shit?
Stop! Cut!
- Cut!
- We'll shoot the next one.
And fix the lights.
Man, some shit's really
happening now!
It's starting to vibe,
don't you think?
Something's happening.
Things are moving.
And it's Cinematic Eye
that says it.
I'm fucking finished!
You don't realise!
If I'm finished, she is too!
- Did you film anything?
- Look!
What did you film?
She's a zombie.
We need solid evidence
to bring her down.
- What have you got?
- With all this...
What have you got, Tom?
- She's a zombie!
- Why?
Fuck nows!
Always dropping off.
Her ex-agent says she might
snort aspirin. Crackhead!
She deserves the electric chair!
A lethal injection in the arse
from my attorney!
That's what I want!
I want her to die!
With all this, we can send her
to the chair, crucify her!
- Can you stay with me?
- No.
What is this?
I'm blind!
Now I'm to blame
for the fucked lighting?
Béatrice Dalle? Béatrice Dalle?
Béatrice Fail!
You'll repay every dollar
I put into this fucking movie!
You're a producer, seriously?
What the fuck is this
in the middle of a shot?!
Is it a nightclub?
What the fuck?
Lighting's your job, isn't it?
Or am I talking out of my arse?
- I'm the DP. Ernesto?
- So who's responsible?
Instead of taking the piss,
communicate!
What are you, a child?
Fuck this!
I'm on a zombie shoot.
I get it, I'm making
a zombie film.
Thanks for telling me.
Now I know!
You're the DP. You manage
the gaffer, don't you?
You're in constant denial.
Who are you again?
Remind me.
You're breaking my ball!
Come down, or I'll come
and get you. Okay?
- Come down!
- Calm down. - No!
Get off my case!
I won't cool it.
I do what I want.
No get down and
we'll take this out.
Maxime, come down.
Come down or you're fired.
All of this is the logical
outcome of the past week!
Goddamn idiot!
You can't even fix this!
It's been an hour and
no-one can cut the lights!
- Calm down.
- Calm? Have you seen this...
The crew from hell...
Move it!
Do something!
Stop! Get the girls down.
No! You shoot nothing!
I decide! And I'm stopping it!
CUT!
CUT! Yannick!
Your DP has gone crazy!
Charlotte, we'll untie you!
We're coming!
- Stop!
- Max, this is a bad idea.
Stop everything!
Stop everything now!
You're not in charge!
I said stop!
Fuck!
Béatrice?
No, I don't want to cut.
Fuck, where's the assistant?
No, no, no.
Untie me!
- Charlotte, you're burning!
- Untie me!
Béatrice!
Untie me! Untie me!
You're insane!
Perfect!
Max, come down or
I'll come and get you!
Stop!
Stop!
Oh my God! Move it!
- I'm on it.
- Look!
Béatrice!
Max, get down and
fix the lights!
Ask Ernesto, it's his job.
Cry, Charlotte!
Cry!
Untie me!
There. Go on.
Make your body quiver!
Tremble!
You're burning!
Imagine you're burning! You cry!
More.
You're burning, in pain!
That's wonderful! Beautiful!
Fabulous!
Stop! Stop everything! Now!
Please! Can someone help them?
Silence!
Silence! I'm shooting!
Don't leave me... Why am I always alone like this? Please. Help me.
Charlotte! We're there!
We're getting somewhere! Charlotte?
Thank God I'm an atheist.
