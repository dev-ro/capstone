Hey, you!
Hello, Doña Isabel!
How is your back?
You owe three months
rent already.
What are you waiting for?
A miracle?
This is an honest community
and if you don't pay...
you're out of here!
Well, the thing is...
You have until Monday.
If not I'll call the police.
This is so good...
How was your day?
Fine.
Alfredo, your feet stink.
We have to do the powder again,
it doesn't last.
The Seventh Art:
Bogart, Garbo and many more.
"The World of Cinema" encyclopedia
by Montoya Publishers.
Buy the first installment and
get the second one free.
For only 30 pesetas.
Every week at your newsstand.
Installments - for what?
It takes three years to get it all.
And then you need
the cover to bind it,
it's more expensive than if you buy
the complete encyclopedia.
Let's go to bed so we can rest
and tomorrow all of us
can go to work...
Sorry.
- I had two left!
- What?
What else, honey?
The condoms.
Alfredo...
Three can live
as cheaply as two.
No, my love, no way.
We can't even pay the electricity
or the telephone or the rent.
We don't even have enough
for condoms.
- What's this?
- No...
- Now you've gotten all upset.
- Yes.
- Come on, my love.
- No, not now.
- Why not?
- No.
You've got me going now.
Where were you?
Don Carlos wants to speak to you.
Get ready, he's sure happy!
Good morning, Miss Vanessa.
I think Don Carlos...
- Uncle Carlos... Alfredo is here.
- Tell him to come in.
Go on then.
Thanks.
Sit down, please.
The door-to-door sales
of encyclopedias
have decreased dramatically.
They only represent
one percent of our total sales.
In less than five years
sales have dropped
from about 1 13 million pesetas
to two million pesetas
in the last quarter...
From a staff of forty salesmen
only four are left.
On the other hand,
the weekly installment
has increased proportionally.
That's why
the door-to-door salesman
is going to disappear.
How long have you been with us?
Fifteen years.
How many?
Fifteen.
And like the old saying goes:
"Renewal or Death".
I have no choice.
I have to restructure
the company.
That's why we are going to
organize a conference
of new sales techniques
for the launch
of a new product, revolutionary
and top secret.
The conference will be held
this coming weekend
in a resort hotel.
Consider yourself invited.
And Marlon Brando gets up,
races off to the kitchen,
gets a bar of margarine
from the fridge...
And he tells her,
"Come here bitch...
take off your pants
and your panties".
All this in French.
I don't speak French
but it doesn't matter...
And he starts to stuff butter
in her buttocks like French toast.
And then... he sticks in
his "twinkie" without warning.
She could be his daughter.
Oh my God!
And he keeps going on and on.
Of course, she screams...
You're hurting me.
You're really hurting me.
I thought
"The Last Tango in Paris"
was a musical.
What an obscene movie!
That would never happen
in Spain.
Paris Beauty Parlor.
Yes.
We're going to a resort hotel
for the weekend.
All expenses paid
by Montoya Publishers.
Ask La Fina if you can
have Saturday off.
Honey, I can't talk right now.
She's looking at me.
I'll call you later, bye.
Tell your husband
not to call you at work.
Honey, we come here
to work, OK? If not... out.
You're too nice, Fina.
My shop girls are the same.
Hasn't it been on too long?
Holy shit!
Your severance pay.
This car does everything but talk.
Look, anatomical leather seats,
anti-fog headlights,
Formula 1 steering wheel,
8-track player
with quadraphonic sound...
- Dynamite!
- Sure. Look where you're going!
But I am looking
where I'm going.
Carmen,
what's bugging you now?
I'm feeling sick...
Will you go a little bit slower?
Slow down.
How many encyclopedias
can you fit in the trunk?
Lots!
This car is fucking great!
DULCINEA HALL:
FIRST CONFERENCE
OF MONTO YA PUBLISHERS
Good evening.
Shut up.
Good evening.
Welcome to Montoya
Publishers first conference.
Vanessa, please.
Good evening,
I am Dr. Johansen
from the Copenhagen Institute
of Sexual Research
and I welcome you to the fascinating
world of Reproduction.
Did you know that in Zaire
the Mambusi tribe
dig holes in the ground
and put their penises in them
to please the fertility gods?
Did you know that in China,
diminutive feet
are a symbol
of beauty and desire?
And that the stronger the aroma
and smaller the size
the greater the pleasure?
Our institute answers
all these questions
with the most fascinating
encyclopedia of all.
"The World Audiovisual
Encyclopedia of Reproduction".
Each week you'll receive
an installment
and one Super 8 movie
featuring the reproductive
rites and customs
of countries
from around the world.
In Scandinavia,
"The World Audiovisual
Encyclopedia of Reproduction"
has achieved record sales.
Montoya Publishers
will have the honor
of collaborating
in the installments
on Spanish
reproductive customs.
And I want to offer you
a unique opportunity.
Make these educational
Super 8 movies
in your own home
while you copulate,
- and you will be participating...
- What's copulate?
...in this rigorous scientific study.
Of course, this encyclopedia
will only be sold
in Scandinavian countries.
Any questions?
Pardon me... In other words,
you want us
to make the movies
when we are making love
to our wives,
in our homes.
Scientifically speaking, yes.
This is an insult. It's disgusting.
How much per movie?
Fifty thousand pesetas
per movie plus a bonus,
depending on the number
of movies sold.
In other words,
installment sales.
Don't you think my wife and I
are too old
for this kind of experiment?
No, I don't. Every complete
scientific experiment
needs a sample
of the entire active population
of the country. Without...
Count on us, Don Carlos.
Thank you.
Without further delay,
let's welcome our experts...
Erik Molander and his wife Frida.
Erik Molander was
a longtime assistant
to the famous Swedish director,
Ingmar Bergman.
Now he's supervisor
of the collection.
During this weekend
Erik and Frida will teach you
how to make these movies.
We can't leave as
we have no car. Otherwise...
Thank you.
As Queen Elizabeth
"The Catholic" used to say,
"Better honesty without ships
than ships without honesty."
Please, thank you.
The prawns are glorious,
have one.
No thank you.
Carmen, you don't look good.
Maybe it's your outfit,
it makes you look short.
Jose Carlos, look at those
lamb chops. They look great!
Do me a favor.
Let me help you.
Alfredo, don't eat
any more prawns, please.
Can I count on you?
If you want to leave, a bus
in the morning
will take you to Madrid.
But if you decide to take this bus,
your services
will no longer be required
by the Montoya Publishing Family.
Honey, I told you not to eat
so many prawns or you'll get sick.
His first smile.
His first caress.
His first kiss.
His first baby food, Nestun.
Alfredo, how much per movie?
Fifty thousand?
And a bonus...
Do we have to do it
with the light on or off?
Don't even think about it.
My wife isn't going to
show her bits.
No way! Not for a science,
not for the pope!
I didn't say anything.
Exactly.
How many encyclopedias
do you have to sell
to get fifty thousand pesetas?
1 54.
Forget it!
We're not going to do it
and that's it!
Carmen...
We can talk about it
if you want.
Pull!
Pull, baby!
The important thing is for woman
not to dress for man
but to take off for man...
slow and hot.
Please, take off clothes for man.
Me?
Now!
All day I don't have.
Your man.
What's this?
A camera.
No, it's your eye,
through which you are going to
see the world from now on.
Bergman used to say,
"Films are the reflection
of reality
seen through the eyes
of a child."
The camera is like a car
and you have to steer
the image.
Ready...
Get set... go.
Everything! Everything!
Shutter, aperture,
viewfinder,
film and battery.
Types of lens:
Wide angle, normal
and telephoto.
Two or three things
I teach you.
Your husband appreciate.
Cut.
Yes, Alfredo?
Erik, I think Frida
threw a shadow over you
and the high angle
isn't the best
to capture the action.
I think a low angle
with a long lens
from the other side
would be much better.
Very intelligent
observation, Alfredo.
Bergman used to say,
"The position of the camera
and the choice of lens
must represent
the soul of the human being."
Alfredo, move the camera.
Fast!
Yes.
- Come on, Alfredo!
- I'm coming!
Alfredo López
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
And so our first conference
comes to an end.
I want you all to take
a few days off
and shoot your first movie.
Do it for the progress of Science.
If you don't know
what to do,
copy the master
who knew damn well
what to do.
The important thing
is to shoot and shoot...
For you.
- Bergman used to say...
- Shut up!
My boys...
Rene, Lars
- and Bo.
- They're precious!
Carmen,
you must have child soon.
- Send photo to me. Copenhagen.
- I promise.
Yes.
This could be the beginning
of a great partnership.
Don't let me down.
Come on guys, hurry up
or we'll get stuck in a traffic jam.
And don't get sick
and slow me down, Carmen.
Hey, you!
Good evening, Doña Isabel.
By the way,
I have what we agreed...
And I'm also going to pay you
two months in advance for rent
and utilities.
Doña Isabel, please,
why don't you fix the toilet?
And the spigot in the bidet
doesn't work. Thanks, good night.
Action!
Take it off.
Ow! You're hurting me!
If it's a boy
we'll call him Alfredo.
And if it's a girl...
Marisol, like the movie star...
I'll explain.
Don't worry, it's not bad.
Not bad.
You have to take care of
some details, but it's not bad.
There's more.
Hit it.
Very good.
Very good. Very good.
Very good.
Congratulate Carmen.
Very good.
Very good.
Very good. Very good.
Remember,
more movies, more bonus.
PREGNANCY TEST
Surprise!
Grundig Supercolor.
The most advanced
television on the market.
You like it?
But it's a color TV.
Honey,
take me to the movies.
I love you.
- Does it still hurt?
- Not much, sometimes.
Does it move?
Well, before it seemed
like a kick.
You're joking! Why is that?
I don't know,
maybe he wants out.
- But it's too soon, isn't it?
- Yes, but he likes to kick.
It was beautiful, wasn't it?
That was a great tearjerker.
The photography was great.
He uses the zoom very well.
Alfredo,
do you love me?
Of course.
Not of course!
I want you to say it.
What?
You silly!
GOODBYE STORK, GOODBYE
I love you baby
I love you baby
I want you to know I'm happy
I love you baby
I love you baby
I live thinking about you
Guide and I will follow
because my way is your way
Look at me
your eyes will be
what makes me see
the sky so blue
Our love is no illusion
of ever-changing color
I love you baby
I love you baby
I want you to know
I'm happy
I love you baby
I love you baby
I live thinking about you
Love me
Your voice is a song
I am king of the world
Love me
The sunshine will shine
like I never imagined
Our love is no illusion
of ever-changing color
I love you baby
You're next.
Carmen, Carmen, Carmen
I love you and you know it
Carmen, Carmen, Carmen
I'll never forget you
Don't listen, please
Don't listen, it's better
Carmen I know you can't sleep
with that great fear
Tell me where can I be better
than with your kisses
and your love
I know you used to say
I don't really love you
Always know it isn't true
without your smile
I cannot live
Always know that people
envy those who are happy
Hey, don't be a pain. Help me.
Carmen, Carmen, Carmen
I love you and you know it
Carmen, Carmen, Carmen
I'll never forget you
Don't listen, please
Don't listen, it's better
Carmen, Carmen, Carmen
I love you and you know it
Carmen, Carmen, Carmen
I'll never forget you
Carmen, Carmen, Carmen
I love you and you know it
Carmen, Carmen, Carmen
Carmen,
I'm tired of...
just making the same movie.
TV SCHEDULE
INGMAR BERGMAN FILM FESTIVAL
22:00 "THE SEVENTH SEAL"
Are you ready?
The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.
Wait a moment.
That is what they all say,
but I don't give any more time.
I'm going to bed.
Do you play chess?
Why should we play?
If you lose the game,
you let me live.
Yours are the blacks.
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you.
Are you taking it, ma'am?
I'm just looking, I don't know.
I'll keep on looking, thank you.
Look, this one is on sale.
It's a great carriage.
I'll take it.
Carmen, what's the matter?
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.
What's this carriage?
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
That's him.
Excuse me!
I'm going to kick his ass!
- Stop over there.
- Pardon me.
Let me deal with him.
Carmen, Carmen...
you sign autograph?
- This is a misunderstanding.
- Sorry, this is a mistake.
Very good actress
and very pretty.
Sure, sure. Give it to me.
- Should I sign?
- Yes.
What's your name?
Carmen... And you?
Dennis, Dennis.
Thank you, thank you.
- Alfredo!
- Carmen!
What a coin-ci-dence.
We were surprised
you didn't return to Madrid.
We were.
It's been a pleasure seeing you.
We have to go now,
we're double parked.
How are the movies going?
Do you have
a life insurance policy?
No.
This is genuine otter...
Call me on Monday.
I'm sure you need
life insurance.
And an accident insurance policy.
Let's go, Jose Carlos.
We're going to be late for church.
Call me.
I have to talk to Don Carlos.
This can't go on.
And finally the Copenhagen
Institute of Sexual Research
sends its congratulations!
The "World Audiovisual
Encyclopedia of Reproduction"
has been a success.
Darling...
Charly, Charly.
- Look who it is!
- It's Máximo Valverde.
Máximo Valverde.
How are you?
I'm so glad to see you!
What's up?
What are you doing now?
Shooting a spaghetti western
in Almería.
They're in style.
The star is Telly Savalas,
and as usual I'll be the ladies' man.
You never stop.
Come and join us.
- Of course!
- Waiter!
Let me introduce you
to my niece Vanessa...
Hello.
- My employee Alfredo López,
- A pleasure.
- How do you do?
- And his wife Carmen.
A pleasure.
Juan Luis Hurtado,
at your service.
Tell me, what are you going to
do after this movie?
I have something to tell you,
Don Carlos.
- Go on.
- Well...
For Carmen and I
it's embarrassing to do these films.
The other day we were shopping...
and a foreign guy was filming us
with a Super 8 camera
and he showed us a magazine that...
That's why
we don't want to make
any more Scientific movies.
Don't worry.
I'll talk to the Institute.
Take some time off and call me
when you get back, all right?
Excuse me... dance?
Hey there,
do you wanna get down?
I was thinking
maybe you and me
could boogie to this tune.
No. Waiter!
It's hot, isn't it?
- Why don't we get it on?
- No.
Okay... no then.
Hey, you're wife's
getting dry humped.
Stop it, Alfredo.
Máximo is a gentleman.
Yeah. And Dracula
was a count.
You're jealous!
Of a hustler who thinks
he's a movie star?
I know you liked him.
Who, me?
You two danced
seven songs in a row.
You even tried to
slow dance to the mambo.
Let's see...
do you have children?
No.
You've wanted one since when?
- Six years...
- Six months...
I'll need a sample
of your sperm.
Mine?
Oh, no, no...
I only came here
to accompany her.
Sister, please!
Carmen, my love,
I've got a great idea
for a long movie.
Title: "Torremolinos 73"...
What do you think?
Let me tell you about it...
it's about a millionaire widow,
with lots of money,
who goes to Torremolinos
after her husband dies.
She can't get him
out of her mind
and she doesn't know
how to get over him...
BY ALFREDO LOPEZ
Hello?
Dr. Regulez's office calling.
We have the results.
ALFREDO LOPEZ SPERM COUNT:
ZERO
Please, Carmen.
Could you turn it down?
Carmen, turn it down!
Fuck, Carmen!
For Christ's sake!
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.
- What's wrong with you, Carmen?
- Nothing.
- Something's wrong with you.
- No.
- Please tell me.
- No.
Tell me what's wrong with you.
Please, what's wrong?
We can't have children.
I told you it couldn't be me.
Carmencita...
I'm sorry, my love.
They said the same
to Nicasia and Martin
and they had triplets.
You know doctors
make mistakes.
Look at your cousin El Chato.
They cut off his good leg
instead of the bad one.
- What a shame!
- It happens all the time...
What if...
we adopt a child?
- Really?
- Sure.
Oh, Alfredo!
All right my love,
come on, calm down.
How is your script going?
Good, very good.
- Do you want to read it?
- Later.
There are things
I don't understand... but I like it.
Really?
I wrote the role of Marga for you.
No!
Yes!
When you finish it,
what then?
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Sorry... sorry.
Excuse me,
could you give this
to Don Carlos?
What's this?
Whatever.
I'll give it to him.
Thank you.
To adopt a child
there are two prerequisites.
First, an annual income
over 500,000 pesetas.
And second,
clean and decent morals,
without any criminal
record of course...
After an in-depth investigation
of each candidate couple,
the Juvenile Court
makes a decision.
- Hello. What's your name?
- Pedro Luis, get back into line.
I just adore them.
How long does it take
for the Juvenile Court
to make a decision?
Not long, four to five years.
Did you know that the movie
"Don't Trust Your 5th Floor Neighbor"
has made 1 00 million
pesetas in Spain
and it cost only six million...?
"The Green Starts in the Pyrenees"
has made 70 million
since it opened.
Movies...
Alfredo, movies
could be a great business.
Because of the great performance
of our audiovisual division,
I've created Montoya Films.
The idea is to make
other types of movies...
like "Torremolinos 73".
I like it, Alfredo,
considering the source,
it has the flavor...
It reminds me of
Bergman's first movies.
Let's see.
How would you like
to direct "Torremolinos 73"?
35 millimeter,
a professional crew...
Don Carlos, don't put me on.
Máximo Valverde
wants to do it.
Máximo?
He would like Carmen
to be his co-star.
We're only amateurs...
Amateurs with talent.
Shoot it. You're gonna
miss it! Cojones!
Where would you like the premiere?
Good shot.
- Did I hit it?
- Bull's-eye.
You don't have to worry
about anything.
You direct. That's your thing.
I'll be in charge of the production.
It'll be delicious in a stew.
Where did everybody go?
Anywhere but here.
Come on, it's February
and you're on the coast.
Sorry if I'm nosy,
but why did you come to Torremolinos?
- We're going to make a movie.
- You're kidding. Who's in it?
Máximo Valverde
and Carmen García.
That Carmen, I don't know her
but her name sounds familiar.
What's it about?
An attractive millionaire widow
decides to stay a few days
in Torremolinos at the hotel
where she spent her honeymoon.
In the hotel she meets
a mysterious man
who looks just like
her dead husband.
I only like movies where
Bud Spencer and Terence Hill
beat each other up
- ping, pang! Those are good!
The best!
What about you?
What are you doing in the movie?
I'm... the director.
Oh, god.
Good evening!
How are you, Carmen?
- Alfredo...
- What's up?
- Nice trip?
- Very nice, thanks.
Come with me. The boys
are anxious to meet you.
Carmen, do you mind?
Carmen, I'll be back in five minutes.
Honey, it's the crew...
Look Alfredo, this is Lauritz,
the director of photography.
A pleasure.
His assistant, Ole.
A pleasure.
This is Aksel on sound.
And finally, Magnus.
A pleasure.
Carmen, Carmen, is she...
Where Carmen? Carmen!
At the reception desk.
Hi, Alfredo.
Juan Luis.
What are you doing here?
Well, here to lend
a helping hand.
- What happened to you?
- Oh, this?
I fell off a horse.
Thanks.
Here they are. Aren't they great?
Could we speak in private?
It's not necessary, none of them
speak Spanish. Tell me.
Then how am I going to explain
what I want to do?
Don't worry, they're professionals
and they know what to do.
But...
As long as you say "Action"
and "Cut", they'll do the rest.
I'm not sure...
That's how co-productions work.
Believe me.
What would you like, sir?
- Have a drink. Take it easy.
- Nothing, nothing. Thank you.
What about Máximo Valverde?
We have a little problem.
This morning I received
a phone call from his manager,
and he said he's doing
Pedro Lazaga's next movie.
He doesn't want to work
with beginners...
You know how artists are.
What are we going to do?
We have two options.
We cancel the shoot...
No.
Or we look for another actor.
Who?
I thought about Magnus.
- Who?
- Magnus.
This is all Torremolinos.
I think he'd be suitable.
Slowly, Carmen. There!
You're alone
in the hotel, all right?
But I'm scared!
It's good for the character.
Feel the fear, feel it.
We're going to start. Carmen,
that's it. Get into position.
Camera!
Now?
Do I jump in now?
Action.
Young lady,
you remind me
of the Greek beauties
who dwelled
in ancient Olympus.
Your visage is familiar.
Your mysterious presence
fascinates and frightens me
at the same time.
Who sent you?
That matters not.
I am here and now.
Do you believe in
a superior
and omnipresent being?
Listen to the silence.
It is the kiss of death.
Cut!
One moment, please.
No, Juan Luis,
tell him to pick the carafe,
not the mussel.
But, but I've already told him.
Not the mussel, the carafe!
Cojones! The carafe.
When Magnus...
picks up the carafe...
Alfredo, they're eating the set!
Panoramic shot...
Carmen...
Hey, I'm to delicate
for all this stress.
Alfredo!
I don't want to! Cojones!
You're a pain in the ass.
Hey Juan Luis,
this is a disaster!
I'm exhausted my love...
Hey, I don't know
who that Magnus thinks he is.
I have to repeat everything
a hundred times.
Poor thing, he tries his best.
He had to learn his lines by ear.
Carmen, please.
I say he's a phony.
Hey, you talk a lot about Magnus,
but what about me?
Anyone would think
I wasn't in the movie.
Oh silly!
Come on, now the other foot.
That's it. That's it.
That's it. That's it.
What did they tell you
at the orphanage?
You haven't even mentioned it.
Alfredo, do you think you could
love a child that wasn't yours?
Of course.
What did Don Carlos say?
Nothing.
You are frightened.
Something is struggling
inside you.
You have an endless desire
for desire.
You never get enough.
Good work, boys!
Very good work!
A wonderful, wonderful day.
Tell them that tomorrow
is the end of the movie
and the last scene.
The end.
What is he saying?
Fiesta, yes, yes...
but tomorrow, okay?
Otherwise you'll go and get plastered.
See you tomorrow!
Tonight big bullfight, matador!
I'm no fucking fairy.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, yes.
Carmen...
You've been fantastic.
You mean it, my love?
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Can we meet at the bar?
I want to discuss
a few small changes
in tomorrow's
shooting schedule.
Sure, Don Carlos.
Well then, I'm going upstairs.
I'm not feeling well.
- You're not?
- No.
I'm very proud of you,
my director.
- Bye.
- I'll be up in five minutes.
Congratulations, Alfredo.
The shoot is a great success.
- I think we've got a winner here.
- Thanks.
With your permission,
I made a few script changes...
As you can see,
the dialogue is the same.
I only changed the action
in the last scene.
This isn't what we agreed.
You didn't say
anything about this...
About what? What did I say?
That you were going to direct
"Torremolinos 73".
Well, you're doing it.
We're shooting in black and white
as you wanted.
Don't be naive. Alfredo...
If we didn't spice up the movie
with some sex
and make a version
for the international market,
do you think I'd get
my money back?
- What about Máximo Valverde...?
- What Máximo?
Carmen is the star.
She's become a sex symbol
in Scandinavia...
- Did you know?
- No.
Besides, if you'll notice,
the script required
only a few insignificant changes.
Your script!
All right?
Now you go and rest.
Tomorrow
at seven o'clock in the cafe.
Alfredo,
get in the water!
Do you know how to say
underpants
in Danish or Swedish?
Come on, smartasses!
Sissy, you nancy boy...
Skivvie-navian!
Good day, Alfredo.
I enjoy really work with you
and Carmen.
Tomorrow big day for me.
What?
No, no, no...
Shit...
Yes?
All ready?
Thank you.
Carmen.
Carmen?
When did you get back?
I was worried.
Carmen, listen to me.
Madam, something else?
Cakes, pies, pastry, rolls,
donuts, danish...
No. Nothing, thank you.
And you, sir?
Nothing, thank you.
If you sit you must order something.
With all these empty tables?
Complain to the manager.
Those are the rules.
You can stick the rules up your...
- Sorry, but I wasn't rude.
- Just leave, please?
Bring him some coffee.
You don't look well, Alfredo.
We're going back to Madrid.
Pack up your things.
We're leaving.
Don Carlos has made
some changes in the script
that you're not going to like.
These?
Yes.
Why do you have them?
Because... because I'm going to do it.
What?
What are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
You want to finish your movie...
and I want to have a baby...
What?
I want to have a baby.
You can't have children.
Yes I can.
Let's go!
Good morning,
how are you doing?
We're going back to Madrid.
Sorry. We quit.
You're going back? Why?
You want more money?
No.
Then what?
Carmen, I kept my promise.
Your husband
is finishing the movie
and now it's your turn.
All right?
Alfredo, I called Erik.
It's understandable
- that you don't want to do it.
- Good. We're leaving.
Hey! It'll be thirty pesetas.
Leave me alone!
You see we're talking?
- You're leaving without paying!
- Here.
- Fine, I'll bring you the change.
- No. Keep it.
Carmen!
Carmen!
Carmen!
Carmen!
Carmen!
Carmen!
Alfredo!
Carmen undresses,
Marcus too...
and they both
face each other... naked.
What this camera for?
For the close-up...
the money shot.
This is going to look
like this, all right?
Yes.
Carmen, we have to start!
Carmen,
when I say "Action" you go
to Magnus and say the lines.
When Magnus says:
"I am Death
and I have come to take you
with your husband",
stop whatever you're doing
and let him do
what he has to do.
Do you understand?
Okay, let's go!
Everybody in position.
Sound!
Camera!
Action!
Marga...
Marga, Marga...
I thought we'd never see
each other again.
It's destiny.
You're not real.
You're a specter...
You exist only in my imagination.
Keep away from me!
You're sublime.
You are metaphysical sin,
the temptation
beyond the grave.
I can no longer resist.
I am Death
and I have come to take you
with your husband.
I am Death...
and I have come to take you
with your husband.
I am...
Cut.
Action.
Maruja,
I love you more than yesterday
but less than tomorrow.
That's the most beautiful thing
I ever heard.
Cut, cut, cut.
You need to be more natural.
You're stiff.
That was the seventh take.
Come on, here we go again.
Come on, hurry up...
You have to cut
the wedding cake.
We've got to go!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Your mommy and dad wish
Happy birthday to you
Who blew out the candles?
Marisol, darling, you have to wait
until daddy says "Action"!
Alfredo, she's just a little girl.
Shirley Temple
was a little girl too.
Wait until I say "Action", okay?
Come on,
blow them out! Blow!
Action!
Blow!
Well done!
- Okay.
- Look!
Cut!
Look! Look!
