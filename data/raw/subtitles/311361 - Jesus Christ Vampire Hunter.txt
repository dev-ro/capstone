 - [Voiceover] He sees
 you, he hears you.
He has seen and heard your sins.
 Your endless shameless sins.
 - [Voiceover] Are you there
 god, why don't you answer me?
 Why don't you give me a sign!
 Tell me whatever you
 please, let me know.
 Let me know you care!
 - [Voiceover] Remember
 ye the words of the lord.
 [indistinct talking]
 [indistinct talking]
 - All thee who are gathered
 here in the darkness,
you imagine that you
are there to witness not
 but an hour of
 flickering fictions?
 Do you imagine that your
 lives are not in jeopardy
 at this very moment?
 This is the empty
 house of your soul.
It's foundations are
built on your childhood
and climbing a lifetime,
 you may never reach
 its top floor.
 Can smell the air within, dry
 and musty with long neglect.
 If you would see the story
 that is about to unfold
 be warned!
 It is nothing less than that
 which lies within these walls
 and within each and
 every one of you.
 Are you prepared to
 take up residence?
 If you are then enter
 but do not make
 the decision likely
 for you will not be alone
 walking these creaking floors.
Remember the words of
our savior when he spake
 in Matthew 28:20,
 "And behold, I am with
 you all of the days
 until the completion
 of the age."

 - Where have all
 our lesbians gone?
 - Alban, Father Alban.
 It's happened
 again, Father Alban.
 - These women are as sheeps
 in the midst of wolves,
Father Eustace.
 I cannot beat to read
 another of these headlines.
- We can no longer stand idly by
and allow these children of god
 to be slain by these
 agents of the devil.
 We alone have been
 entrusted with the knowledge
of power; a man who can
stop this unholy plague.
 You know of whom I speak.
 - You mean--
 - Loose lips, Alban.
 - Forgive me.
- Of course, but you understand
your responsibilities?
 - Since I first
 entered the order,
 I knew this day would come.
- Good, arrangements
have already been made.
 In fact...

 for the fallen
 sheep of our flock.
 - Tell me what the problem is.
 - You see, my lord,
 you are the only one
who can stem the spread
of this contagion.
 If these leeches prevail,
 the faith will need no
 longer fear going to hell.
 - For hell will come to us.
 - I am here to build a kingdom
 out of my fathers kingdom.
I cannot rush to the battlements
before the foundations are made
 or else the walls
 will surely collapse.

 - Father Eustace, I presume.
 [upbeat suspicious music]
 - The church maintains
 this apartment
 for visiting clergy members
 and parishioners in need.
 You can stay here as
 long as necessary.
 - I've slept in worst places.
 - I'm quite busy with
 my clerical duties
 but it will be good
 to know where you are.
Now, you must be hungry
after your long trip.
Speaking of which, where
are Alban and Avellino?
 - I'm afraid we have
 much to discuss, Eustace.
- [Voiceover] Jesus!
[funky electronic music]
 [indistinct talking]
 [groovy rock music]
 - My only consolation
 is in knowing
that Father's Avellino and
Alban are now in a better place.
- They were not the
first to fall, my lord.
Both these pictures were
taken at a singles dance
that the church held last year.
 This is John Golan, he worked
 for a local television station
 and produced public
 service announcements
 for the churches charity work.
 A good soul, he was the first
 member of my congregation
 to disappear.
 Miriam Scheider, a
 successful concert promoter
 but she still took time out
 to volunteer at
 our soup kitchens
 and at the food bank.
 People came as
 much for her smile
as for the food.
She's been missing for
nearly eight months now.
 - This is the woman that
 attacked me at the beach.
 She killed Avellino and Alban.
 - I feared as much.
There have been rumors.
I didn't want to
believe at first
 but every Sunday I see
 fewer and fewer faces
 in the pews.
 I fear my parish
 is being consumed,
 body and soul.
 - There have been
 more disappearances?
 - Many, as recently
 as last night.
 Young women mostly.
 The church has been unwilling
 to act on this matter
because of the lifestyle
of these women.
- The church should
learn to leave judgment
 to higher powers.
 Do you suppose that
 the disappearance
 of these ladies of Sappho
 is somehow connected
 to the fact that these
 vampires can walk
in the daylight?
- That is what you
must find out, my lord.
 - This case requires
 the attention of one
 from whom the truth
 cannot be hidden.
 Here, it's yours anyways.
It's from the collection plate.
 The church can wait a couple
 of weeks for a new TV.
 - I'll need to buy
 some wood, for stakes.
 [upbeat suspicious music]
[energetic dance music]
[tense suspicious music]
- Hello, Jesus.
 You don't know us because
 we've never talked
 to you before.
 We are the atheists.
 - Look Jesus, we're taking
 your second coming as down.
 Consider the 13th
 station of the cross.
 - Let's get on with
 the conversion.

 [funky groovy

[funky electronic music]
[tense soft rock music]
 [energetic rock music]
 - I'm on your side Rabbi, see?
 No fangs.
 [energetic rock music]
 - Sorry, I'm a little tense.
 - I've got just what you need.
Feeling a little bit
more relaxed now, Rabbi?
 - I'm fine.
 - Here, let me help.
 - How'd you find me?
 - Well, every night
 before I go to bed,
 I get down on my knees
 and ask for direction
 but I was here on
 other business.
 - Vampires?
- The archdioceses doesn't have
an monopoly on faith, Rabbi.
The branch of the
church to which I belong
 has been operating
 discreetly for quite awhile.
 The position of
 women in the church
 hasn't always been
 so horizontal.
 - I remember.
- Our research indicates
that authentic vampirism
 is actually what
 we've come to term,
 a quantum infection,
 acting sometimes as the virus,
other times a bacterium,
 still other times as
 a fungal infestation.
 Which may explain the power
 of the inflicted individual.
 Depending on the observer,
 even under strict
 lab conditions,
 it's impossible to batch sets
 of vampire tissue samples.
 The results are
 just too chaotic.
 We suspect that the
 vampires vulnerability
 to light has something
 to do with the fact
 that light exists as both
 a particle and a wave,
again depending on the observer.
 You follow?
 - I understand light.
 - I came to the city
 to see this man.
 He's been doing fascinating
 work with grafting
 and cryptopathology.
 I think that if we find him,
 he might be able to hand us
 a big piece of the puzzle.
- Let's go then.
- Walking around in this thing,
it's not exactly inconspicuous.
 You might as well
 be wearing a halo.
 I think we should get
 you some new clothes.
 Something a little more urban.
 - But I have nothing to hide.
- Maybe not but you
sure have a lot to show.
 - [Voiceover] Jesus!
 - Hey, can I try this on.
 - In the back, my blue
 eyed soul brother.
 Like I said, in the back.
 - Thanks.
 - Jesus, what do you think?
They're salt and pepper shakers.
I collect them.
 - Oh, they're grand.
 [playful funky
 instrumental music]
 - Here, let me help.
Up, up.
 [playful instrumental music]
 Okay, up, up.
 Up.
 Gorgeous.
 - I need to see
 Johnny, where's he at?
- What, lay up.
 - Give me a boost.
 - There's a new player in
 town, I need to tell Johnny.
 Where's he at?
- I don't know, I think
he's doing the TCP
 down at the hospital.
- I'll go check,
 if he comes back
 tell him I was here.
- Come on, Mary.
 - Hold up.
A lousy nickel?
 That shirt's worth
 a [unintelligible]
 if it's worth a subway token.
 - Alright, I'll give you six.
 - Six?
 That won't even buy
 me a pimp steak.
Come on, put your weight on it.
- Seven?
- Seven?
See, now you in the hood
 but you way down the block.
- $8.50.
 - Wear it like you mean it.
 - How much?
 - For you, free as OJ.
 [groovy rock music]
 [upbeat jazz music]
[suspicious instrumental music]
 - If I'm not back in five
 minutes, call the pope.
Mary, I'm stuck.
 [suspicious tense

- [Man] Nor to men put
new wine toward skins--
 - What, what is it?
 Let me see.
 - And the wine is
 poured out, yes, yes.
 But they put new
 wine into new skins
and both are preserved together.
Those were the words
of the apostle Matthew,
 chapter nine verse
 17, to be exact.
 [he laughs]
He brought these healing
truths to the people
 in the only way available.
 Through the pseudoscience
 of religion.
 [he laughs]
Oh yeah.
 [he laughs]
Men of science, like of myself,
 the apostles of
 the new millennium,
 can make his words flesh.
Photo-sensitivity is a
symptom of vampirism yes
 but it can be controlled.
 This skin, grafted
 on to your body
 will provide you the
 immunity you need
to walk in the daylight.
 The procedure's simple
 and the anti-rejection
 drugs will leave you
in a pleasantly euphoric state.
 [he laughs]
 It's important to
 nourish the new skin
 by ingesting massive
 amounts of human hemoglobin
 over the next few days
but that shouldn't be a
problem, now should it?
 - Doc.
 Slice open anyone
 interesting today.
 I know I did.
You'll be wanting a
new janitor by the way.
 - Really Mr. Golgotha,
 I must protest.
 This is a sterile environment.
- Well I didn't come to
commit the sin of Onan,
 just to check in on
 our latest convert.
How's she doing?
 - Still partially catatonic.
 She's still suffering
 from the effects
of post mortem stress disorder.
 - Give me a call when you're
 done with her body work.
 Whoa, speaking of body work.
 Hey, Max, how'd you find me?
 - Followed the screams
 Johnny, just like always.
 Can you zip me up?
Listen, we need to talk.
 - How's about over lunch?
 I'm famished.
 - You're a glutton.
 - Wow, who's that?
 - She's a vampire.
 - Oh, too bad.
- I saw her kill two
priest with my own eyes.
 - Mr. Golgotha, Ms. Shreck,
 we're running low on skin.
 I suggest we harvest
 another lesbian.
 - 30 minutes or it's free.

 - And when you have
 lived in this empty house

 this same question
 this certain lawyer
asked of our lord in Luke 10:30,
 "Who is my neighbor?"
[somber classical music]
 - Help me.
[somber classical music]
 - Please, help me.
 - Sorry mate, my
 compassion ended at 6 PM.
[somber classical music]
- Help.
- Oh Fifi, look.
 Jesus, honey, you're a mess.
 - How did you know my name?
 [somber mysterious music]
[unintelligible]
[speaks Spanish]
 - You're a stranger to me
 but no stranger that I am.
 It is strange what you see
 when you look through
 stranger's eyes.
 You've got that
 look in your eyes,
 like you grow up on your own.
 Different, apart,
 and feeling alone.
 I know how it feels,
 when there's something inside.
 Something too queer to show
 but to real to hide.
Goodnight, sweet prince.
 - [Voiceover] Jesus!
[soft somber jazz music]
- I'll be back with your
dessert in a minute.
 - Excuse me, I didn't order...

 [indistinct talking]

- Is that you bowl of cherries?
 - Do bowls of
 cherries talk, Jesus?
 - I don't know, I've seen
 a lot of strange things
over the years.
- You need help, Jesus,
 and I have not forsaken you.
 - Oh, it's you Dad.
 So what's your advice.
- Seek out the sage of
the wresting ring, son.
 He will stand along side you
 and call your mom,
 she misses you.
 [upbeat funky Spanish music]
 [upbeat funky Spanish music]
 - [Man] Hombre,

 [upbeat funky Spanish music]

 just one photo.
- Any truth to the
rumor that you're coming
 out of retirement?
 - Any words for you fans?
 - What do you think
 about the state
of professional
wrestling today, Santo?
- Any comments on the
allegations that you've
 had a falling out with
 Aztec Mummy Ensemble?
- No comment, I have no comment.
 Please direct your
 questions to Ms. Oddball.
 [upbeat funky Spanish music]
 - Could you step aside so I
 can get a photo of El Santo?
 [cameras whir]
- Make sure you get my good side
 or you'll get on my bad side.
 [he laughs]
 - Thanks so much.
 [upbeat funky Spanish music]
 - Now there's my front page.
 [camera whirs]
 - I've been a fan of your
 flying clancho take down
 for years, Santo.
 It's an honor to
 finally meet you.
 - The pleasure is all mine.
 I apologize for the reporters.
 They are harder to escape
 than the Blue Demon's
 cobra clutch.
 [upbeat Spanish music]
 - Santos, over here champ.
I've got a car waiting.
- Madre de Dios, my old manager.
 Don't let this
 gringo con you Jesus,
he'll have you wrestling midgets
 in border towns for
 10 % of the net.
 Danny, amigo.
[funky electronic music]
 - Hey Santos, you got to see
 this new act I'm managing.
 Stop by tonight and we'll
 talk a little business.
 - Gracias, Danny.
 I know why you're
 here my savior.
 I have chosen to
 call myself the saint
and as such, I am your servant.
 To you my lord, my
 face is forever naked.
Now tell, you have found a place
to begin our investigation.
 Si?
[funky electronic music]
 [soft playful foreign music]
 - Hey man, watch it.
You getting all in the kool aid
 and you don't even
 know the flavor.
 - I know you know
 Johnny Golgotha,
 tell me where he is.
 - Hey, I'm as close
 as 99 is to 100
 to Johnny and his crew
 but I don't know you
 from Adam, madam.
 - You can save lives.
You have to tell us where he is,
 for the sake of your soul,
if nothing else.
 - Yeah, tell that
 to a one legged man
 so he can bump it off
 down the road, Jack.
 [he screams]
 Okay, okay, I collar the jive,
 you the boss, Dick.
 Say I cop, than I'd be cleaner
than the Board of Health, right?
 - If you are truly repentant.
 - Okay then man, okay.
Lay up.
 I know you want
 that grey-boy bad
 but hustlers don't
 call showdowns, dig?
 Johnny and his main mellow
 are out of town today.
 There ain't nothing shaking
 until tomorrow morning,
 down at the point.
 - Don't tempt me.
- [Voiceover] Oh, Jesus!
 [somber suspicious
 classical music]
 [he laughs]
 - Good evening
 ladies and gentlemen
 and welcome to the
 Dominion Tavern.
 There's a lot of beautiful
 faces in the house tonight
but the man you're here
to see can't see you.
 So make some noise for
 Mr. Blind Jimmy Leper!
 [crowd cheers]
 - Thank you, thank
 you very much.
 Thank you.
 [groovy rockabilly music]
 [scatting]
 [scatting]
 [groovy rockabilly music]
 - Jesus, I'm afraid I must
 confess the sin of lust.
 - Don't worry Santos,
 he forgives all.
 [he laughs]
 - Thank you, thank
 you, thank you.
So I've been told we've
got a very special
 person in the audience
 there tonight.
 Without with there'd be
 no soul for the brothers.
 So, I'd like put your
 hands together for our lord
 and our savior, Jesus Christ.
[crowd applauds]
 - One, two, unos, dos, tres.
[upbeat big band music]

I was born in a manger.

[upbeat electronic dance music]
 [he exhales]
 [he exhales]
 [upbeat electronic music]
 - This may seem sudden
 but I have learned from my
 many years of experience
 in the ring, to strike when
 the opportunity arises.
 What I'm trying to say is,
you've pinned my
heart to the mat
and I think I love you.
 [upbeat electronic music]
 - Where is everybody?
 - They split, baby.
[hair clippers buzzing]
- [Voiceover] Hello son.
 I was just wanting
 to check up on you.
Are you keeping busy then, dear?
 - Yeah, Mom.
 I'm trying to help
 some lesbians.
 - Oh god loves them, they
 get so much done in a day.
Don't you think?
 - Yeah, listen, I
 really have to go.
These vampires--
 - Oh, now you're letting
 those boys push you around,
are you?
 They might seem
 bigger than you now
 but who do we
 always say is going
 to inherit the earth, dear?
- The meek, Mom.
- That's right love, now
don't let me keep you,
 you go on now.
 - Kay, Mom, talk to you later.
 I love you.
[knock at door]
 Hey.
 [tense rock music]
 - We have your friend
 Santo on the ropes.
 Unless you want to see
 him go down for the count,
 I suggest you deliver
 yourself to us.
 [tense rock music]
 - If you would heal you woes
 and prolong your life,
 look not here in this
 pharmacy of human vanity.
 But here!
 Recall ye the words
 of the messiah
as they are spoken in Luke 4:23,
 "Physician, heal thy self."
 [triumphant classical music]
- Time for revelation, my lord.
 [car engines turn on]
 [engines rev]
You really haven't done anything
 that they haven't, my lord.
 You rose from the
 dead, so did they.
 You promised eternal
 life, so did they.
 But they offer so
 much more power.
 - I really I wish
 we had the time
 to invite more people, Jesus.
 It's not everyday a
 guy get's a chance
 to commit deicide.
 Sacrifice is your
 thing, isn't it?
- I think you need to go
back to Sunday school.
 My death was never
 the end of the story.
 - Let's get this over with.
- Any last words, Jesus?
- No, I've got a
question though.
 Why lesbians?
 - They're deviants,
 no one will miss them.
 - There's nothing
 deviant about love.
 - Good one.
 The truth is as bitter
 as garlic to them.

 [tense adventurous music]
 - Thank you Loyd.
 We're here live on location
 at GNL auto wrecking
 and recycling where a pitch
 battle is taking place
between forces of good and evil.
Unconfirmed reports
indicate that none other
 than Jesus Christ is involved
 in a winner take all
 fight to the finish
with an unknown
assailant or assailants.
 I think I can see him now.
 [tense music]
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 this is incredible.
 - But you're at
 the wrecking yard.
 On TV live!
 - I'm everywhere.
 And on the 7th day, he rested.
 [tense instrumental music]
 [he shouts]
 [he laughs]
 [tense instrumental music]
 [tense instrumental music]
 - I've got you now.
 [wet smacking]
 [tense instrumental music]
 - Not even this separates
 you from my love.
[energetic tense music]
[dramatic music]
[dark dramatic electronic music]
[moist sizzling]
 - [Santo] No my lord, no!
 [dark dramatic music]
 [uplifting instrumental music]
 - My love cannot heal
 this woman, my lord
 but perhaps yours can.
 Will you try?
 - Her soul is in
 jeopardy, Santos.
 Just as millennia balance
 on the silver of time
 between the ticks of a clock,
 so does her soul
 now stand balanced
 on a precipice between
 the unending light
 of heaven and the
 undying fires of hell.
I can work this miracle, Santos.
 To you and to your
 love for Maggie.
 Are you ready to
 live up to your name?
Remove her mask!
 [uplifting music]
 [soft romantic music]
[speaks Spanish]
- Rabbi, where's Maxine?
 - Maxine?
 Maxine Shreck?
 - Rabbi, I owe you
 so much already.
 The peace in my soul
and Maxine, she brings me a joy
that I never thought
possible here on Earth.
 I was wondering, would you,
 could you...
 - Yeah, sure, okay.
 [soft romantic music]
 But Maggie, aren't
 you a lesbian?
 - No, I'm bi.
 - Yes, yes!
 [he laughs]
 Yes, yes!
 [they laugh]
 Yeah, right!
 - But the end of all
 things is drawn nigh.
 Be sober therefore and
 watchful onto prayers
 but before all things,
 having fervent love
 amongst yourselves because
 love covers a multitude
of sins.
 Beloved, take not estrange
 fire of persecution
 which is taken
 place amongst you,
as if something strange
was happening to you
 but as ye have share in
 the sufferings of Christ,
rejoice then in the
revelation of his glory,
 also he may rejoice
 with exaltation.
 - Back when I was hanging
 out with the apostles,
we had a saying,
if you can bear the
whole yolk of the lord,
 you'll be perfect
 but if you can't,
 then do what you can.
 I don't want you to
 accept anything just
 because I say it.
 Think about it, make
 up your own mind
and if you choose Christianity,
 don't follow me,
 follow my teachings.
 It's the messages
 that's important
 not the messenger.
 [phone ring]
 [phone ring]
 Hello?
Hey JP, I can't talk right now,
I'm in the middle of something.
 Yeah, okay well later.
 Listen, you don't need me
 to tell you these things.
 I'm not here to
 give you new laws,
 I'm just telling you
 what you already know.
 I'm the part of you that
 feels bad when you don't give
 that homeless guy
 your spare change.
 You know what's right.
 Trust yourselves.
Learn to love, learn to forgive,
and remember five keeps
a neighborhood alive.
