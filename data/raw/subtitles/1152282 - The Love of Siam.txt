What's the matter with you, Mew?
Are you alright?
Don't be stubborn.
C'mon, get up.
Grandma is waiting for you.
Let's go.
C'mon. Give it to aunty.
(sign)
My friend.
Do you want to move to Rayong with papa?
No. Why would I?
They wouldn't want me to stay with them.
It's not like that.
They see you as a big boy,
they let you stay here to
take care of your grandma.
And why don't you move there together?
I'm not going. I'm too old now.
I don't want to move anywhere anymore.
You are selfish.
I can't make it.
- Can you do it?
- No. Show it to me!
Here. Take a look.
- See? You see?
- Aww.
Do you have to blow it hard?
Ok, we do it together.
One. Two...
Ooops.
Eww...
Oh. I can't make a balloon.
Why are you so bad at it?
You got him there. Come here.
- Here. Here.
- No.
No...
Grandma...
Grandma.
Ohh. Roasted chicken.
Roasted chicken!
Always my favorite.
Umm. Who will lead the prayers?
Oh c'mon. Again?
Ok. Let the one who came late do it.
Ohh...
What are you chewing, Tong?
Chewing gum again, aren't you?
Spit it out! Now!
Here.
Get it out.
How may times have I told you
not to chew it?
What if it stuck in your throat?
Tang, you never teach your brother.
Ok. He got it out.
It's ok. Let it go.
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Dear Lord.
Please bless us and the food we have.
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Grandma.
Grandma.
You are angry at me, aren't you?
Grandma.
What are you playing, huh?
You are breaking grandpa's piano.
Let me sit.
I'll show you how to play it.
Why do you like this song so much?
Your grandpa always plays it for me.
He must be good at it.
Of course.
Do you want to be as good as him?
I don't know why I have
to be good at this.
Maybe one day.
You can use it to show your
feelings to other people,
the way your grandpa told me.
So what did he tell you?
Listen.
He was saying that he missed you
when he came home and nobody was here.
He would be lonely.
Would you accompany me for a while?
Where should we go?
I don't know.
Eh. Eh. Stop.
Isn't that Mew?
- The good pianist
- The sissy boy
Hey. Mew...
- Hey. Let's do it.
- Let's try.
How big is your wiener? Can we see it?
Hey. Hey.
Hey, get out.
Bastard! We'll get you.
Here. Here.
Stop playing.
Can you handle it?
Yes, indeed.
They're here. You're in trouble.
We're back.
You're just gonna sitting there
and not helping us?
- Here. I'll help.
- Tong. Get up and help.
- You're not moving at all.
- Oh. You bought a lot of things here!
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I have some work in Chiangmai.
This weekend we will all go there.
Chiangmai?
- Yeah.
- Mom, we are going to Chiangmai!
- Here. We got you a shirt.
- Here. Tong.
Why are you wearing sun glasses?
Ahh. I want to be
handsome like you, dad.
You wanna be handsome?
Here. Your shirt.
- It's so cute.
- It fits you perfectly.
Aww. Purple. I don't like purple.
Yellow!
Here. Purple!
Yellow!
Take the glasses off and take a look.
Ah. Ah. Take this.
Umm.
What happened to your eye?
- Football hit my face.
- Softball.
So what is it?
- Football hit my face.
- Softball.
Are you sure it's football?
Of course. It's football. Really.
Yes. It's football.
Do you want to match the other side?

Tang, are you ready?
Yes.
Oh. What are you taking so much?
Umm. Umm. Mom.
Can I stay longer with my friends?
Just a couple more days.
I already asked dad.
He told me to ask you.
Please mom. Please. Please.
It's ok. She's a big girl now.
Letting her go with friends is ok.
Hey. What's up? I'm back.
- Was it good?
- Err. It's kinda fun.
I got you something.
That's for your gandma.
For Mew.
If you want it, you have
to... take this first.
What's this?
Little sweet palm in the garden?
What is it?
I don't know.
You have to look for it.
Behind you.
That way. That way.
Behind?

Why do you have to make it so difficult?
- Aww.
- You don't like it?
I didn't say that.
It's fun.
Where did you get this game from?
Oh. From my dad.
At home, when we are giving gifts.
That's how he is.
Your family is so fun, huh?
# 'Slanted tree by the river' #
Go. Go...
Go! Let's go.
Ohh. Too bad.
That's the last piece.
It's ok.
I'm happy enough that
you bought this for me.
Are you sure?
Just ask your mom yourself, ok?
What is it?
When are you arriving?

Not yet. Err. I think.
But you said you're coming back today.

Just a little longer, mom.
On the 24th, I will be back home
Please.
Ok Ok.
If you are tricky like this,
I won't let you travel anymore.
Thank you.
It's ok.
She's a grown up.
Let her go sometimes.
You let her do things like this
They're only girls
Aren't you worried about her?
# Silent Night #
Silent Night,
Holy Night.
Wondrous star,
Lend the light
With the angel, let us sing
Hallelujah to our king
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Hello.
Grandma. Over there.

I'm not finished yet, son.
Are you with Mew?
Go home with grandma first.

Yes. Yes. It's fine.
Tong. Let's take some pictures.
Come here.
Take one with Mew.
Ok. Closer, closer.
Ok. Smile.

Dear our lady Mary
gave birth as a virgin to the Messiah,
Our Lord Jesus.
Virgin Mary,
please pray for us now, and when we die.
Amen
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Tong.
When we went to Chiangmai
Tang went hiking with her friends
at Kun Yuam Mountain.
She might got away from the group
and she got lost.
Tang might got lost.

That jungle is so big...
She might not be able
to come back again...
So what are you going to do, Tong?
He said they are still waiting for her.
Grandma, do you think
Tang's going to be alright?
We shouldn't have let her go.
If only we'd stopped her.
In the name of the Father and the Son.
Tong!
We don't have to.
Sunee.
Tong.
Mew.
We are moving out.

You're not waiting for Tang anymore?
# Have you heard
that there is a place?
# If we get there, we
will have everything.
# It will wait for us at
the end of the way.
# And we need only one ticket.
# We can go and come back many times.
# What will you tell me
when you come back?
# I'm wondering if it's true.
I want to see it.
# Even if I have to go by foot.
If there's something when I get there.
# Even if the ticket is so expensive.
Whatever I have to pay, I'll get it.
# I have paid all I have
for someone to tell me
# that this ticket is not for me. #
Oh mom, wait.
# This train doesn't have a seat for me.
Why not? #
I want to listen to this song first.
# I don't have the right to go. #
- Do you have a session after school?
- Of course.
When do you want me to pick you up?
Umm. Let me call you.
Jeng, take the bag for me.
Take the phone too.
Ok. Ok.
Tong!
Tong! Bastard!
Ok. See you tonight.
Forget something?
Don't drink too much.
I know.
- Who are you looking for?
- Mew.
Over there...
Mew. Aex. Hello.
How are you?
This morning, did you hear our song
playing all over the school?
Yes.
So, what did Aod say?
He said...
Hey wait...
Wait, wait. You two pay attention to me.
Umm. Your songs are really good...
But I want to tell you something.
In terms of the content,
it should be more universal,
so that more people can listen to this.
A little more than now.
But quite a few people
like it already, Aod.
Yes, but only a small number.
Let me ask you this:
Don't you want a lot of people
to listen to your songs?
The melody, I can say it's very good.
You are really good at it,
and I have the same idea
as what you have.
To bring in new kinds of sounds
to the music industry.
That's right, and that's very good.
But why don't we make it easier?
If the contents of the song
appeal to more people,
and their feelings relate to the songs,
it's definitely better!
Like what?
Love, Mew.
95% of the top charts,
of all the charts,
All love songs.
And it should be easy
for people your age.
It's so easy for people your
age to write love songs.
Really?
Yes. Believe me.
Let's try.
Aod...
Ah. June, come in.
Yes.
Here's June.
Hello.
From now on, about everything from
practicing to work schedule,
you can talk to June directly.
She will give you a call.
Back to our issue.
About love songs.
I want them quick, ok?
So we can use it as your new single.
When should it be, Mew?
Umm...
Why don't you take my calls lately?
Sometimes I was in class,
sometimes I was playing soccer.
Playing soccer?
Tong, lately you are so cold to Donut.
Really?
What are you thinking, Tong?
Tong, do you still want
to go out with me?
I... don't know.
Why, Tong?
Tong, you don't love Donut anymore?
June is so cute.
Right!
Where are you going?
I think June looks like someone I know.
- Who's that?
- Mew.
I don't know.
- Mew?
- Yes.
- Hey, hey. Listen.
- Can I call June for you tomorrow?
- You're so you!
- Our CD is sold out!
- What?
- What.
Our new CD. Sold out!
Are you happy?
Yeah...
It's doing well already, Ã™...*****
Why would we have to
change the contents?
Let's discuss that later.
Let's go practice.
Excuse me, do you have an
album from August's band?
Ahh. We're just sold out.
The people who made it
just came here a moment ago.
There they are, let's ask them.
They just walked away.
You can go and ask them.
Hey, is that Tong?
- Is it Mew?
- Yes.
Hey. How have you been?
Haven't seen you in a long time.
Just so so.
Not much.
- Ok.
- What about you, Tong?
Same.
And you are in this band?
Yes, I sing for them too.
August Band.
Hello.
- Tong, how do you know?
- Ahh.
The guy at the store told me...
I'm here to buy your
CD and it's sold out.
Oh yes! But I can make one for you.
Hey, it's ok, Mew.
I can buy it from a store.
Ohh. But if you want to buy it,
you'll have to wait for a long time
because we're not making
this version anymore.
What should we do?
So, give me your number.
I will burn a CD at home
and give it to you tomorrow.
Ok. Ok.
The number is 0-8-3.
- 9-0-1.
- Mew.
8-3-2-0.
I'll call you.
How was class?
It was good, mom.
What subject was it?
Chemistry.
And you understood it?
Of course. Why?
Your text books are
still on the back seat...
Today's class was on video
and we got handouts.
Are you sure you went to class?
Sure.
What's the matter?
You look unhappy.
My mom nags me all the time.
Whatever I do, she nags nags nags.
So what did you do, Ying?
Ying didn't do anything.
Mew! What are you doing?
Writing a song.
Really? What is it about?
It's about... love.
Love?
That shouldn't be hard.
Umm. I don't know. I...
I... I've never been in love...
Mew, you don't have a girlfriend?
Really, Mew? Really?
Mew, you don't have
a girlfriend, do you?
Mew, really?
Oh, that's enough.
I don't want to talk about this
So, if you want to know
what it's like to have a lover,
I can to be your girlfriend.
Is that good?
You're crazy.
- Why?
- No!
Ying...

Ying, where are you?
- I gotta go, Mew.
- Ok.
Think about it, ok?
Everybody needs someone...
I'll try.
Tong, wait.
Go get a plate for Tang.
Tang is not here.
She will not come back.
Who's that?
It's me, Mew.
Oh, Mew. What's up?
Umm. About the CD.
I'll give it to you at
Siam Square tomorrow.
Ok. Ok. What time?
Evening.
-
- Hello?
- Tong.
- Hey Mew.
I'll call you back tomorrow.
Ok. Talk to you then.
Not taken a shower yet?
Just about to go...
Hey!
What's the matter?
Got crap in your throat?
Tong. I heard you fought
with Donut yesterday?
Where did you get that?
I chatted with her friend
on MSN last night.
What did she say?
She said you're a big bastard.
You never care about her.
Ahh. I think you got her
and now you wanna leave her.
I don't understand you.
Donut is so pretty.
She can choose anyone.
And she chose you.
Why don't you take care
of her a bit more?
I don't know. I am what I am.
She doesn't understand.
Because you are like this.
Let me be straight forward.
Do you want to break up with her?
Hello. Donut?
Well. We will do it like a lucky draw.
To see what kind of
first aid you have to do.
- Banjong.
- Yes, teacher.
Pick one.
Get one!
Quick!
CPR...
What's that?
Ehh.
I taught you.
You don't remember anything, huh?
Maybe I should I just let you fail.
...But I don't know.
Should I really?
Ahh. Or do you want zero?
- Stay still
- Aa. Aa.

Whoo!
Hey... Shhh...
Don't close your eyes. You animal!
Eww.
Mew.
Why did you put your tongue in my mouth?
What is this? I didn't!
You put it in.
Eww... Waa.
What's this?
Eww.
Waa. Your saliva.
Umm. Aex, where is Mew?
Don't know!
Hey Aex, I heard you kissed
Mew on his mouth.
Bastard, I asked you nicely.
The number you're calling
is not available.
The number you're calling
is not available
Still keeping this?
Huh.
- Mew.
- Huh.
Can you play that song for me?
Which one?
The one you played when we were kids.
Umm.
This one?
Someone moved into that place?
Huh.
Have you even seen her back here?
Who?
No. Nothing...

You haven't forgotten about it.
Tong, if you have a chance
to see Tang again,
what will you say to her?
I don't know...
I may ask 'why'?
Why?
Why she left us like this?
It's not her fault, Tong.
Oh, you got a friend here?
Oh, I thought I was gonna
borrow your dictionary.
Let me come back later.
Hey. It's ok.
It's ok, Mew.
It's time for me to go, anyway.
Let me walk you downstairs.
It's ok. Find a
dictionary for her first.
I'm going.
Your friend is cute.
Aa. Ying!
(Chinese)
You often go to Mew's place.
It's not so good.
People will talk.
- Ai Ya!
- Mama.
No need to nag her.
People know that Mew is a sissy boy.
Ahh. Why are you saying this?
Mew is not sissy.
He is a man.
You better watch what you say. Whoo.
# It might have been a long time...
# It might have been so far away...#
Very nice.
Really nice.
We will use this song to
promote your next album.
Umm June, please take them
to practice this evening too.
Yes.
From now on, we will
practice at Saw Record.
- Reserve it.
- Right away.
Very nice.
Look at this...
Why isn't Tang in this picture?
She already gone with her friends?
I can't remember.
And why don't you show
pictures of her?
Because she isn't here anymore.

Hey Mew...
That chord, your A Flat Augmented Seven.
How do I play it?
Wan is playing keyboard.
Just ask him.
A Flat
C.
E.
E.
G.
Isn't that G Flat? Hey.
Yeah right, G Flat.
G Flat.
G Flat.
Oh oh.
Kinda difficult.
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
G... Flat.
I'm asking for A Flat Augmented Seven!
Isn't that funny?
Got an issue with him?
No no. Nothing.
You're in the same band.
Why don't you talk?
Don't get angry at each other.
It's just a nonsense thing.
Umm. They say.
People who are anygry at each other
about silly things
usually are the ones who care
about each other so much.
- Right?
- Right. Right. Ahh.
Are you crazy?
- Oh it's getting too far now.
- Oops.
Now.
Time's up. Go.
Continue practicing.
I'll get some snacks.
- Do you want anything?
- Yes, yes.
- Two Gob Gob.
- I want Lays.
I'll be back.

Play well.
Hello, what's up Mew?
Are you busy? Got smething to show you.
Sure. Where?
Tong! Where're you going?
- Just around here.
- Hey!

Life didn't have any meaning...
Do you feel like I feel.
That the days we were together.
The days we were together
- Ah. Tong, come in
OK, this will be the last time.
We only have a few minutes left.

It might have been a long time
It might have been so far away
That we walked in our own way that day
There might be many people.
Hundreds or thousands of them
Who came into my life
and made it go around
Or because they are not you
And I hadn't found what I had lost
Or because that day what I did was wrong
and made it impossible for us
to go back to that day
Do you feel like I feel?
That the day without you
Life didn't have any meaning
Do you feel like I feel?
That the days we were together.
The days we were together.
None of those days that we were unhappy
June, this is Tong.
Tong, this is June.
Your friend is so quiet.
Are you at the same school?
I am in another school.
Oh really?
So, how did you get to know each other?
When we were kids, we were neighbors.
If you don't eat this, I'll take it.
This one too.
- You don't have anything left?
- Ok, I'll give it back.
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.
Go! Get in the car.
Ok, see you later.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
Bye.
See you, Tong. Good luck, Mew.
Good luck. Good luck.
Umm. So, how are you going home?
What time is it?
Tong, do you think June looks like Tang?
Looks like him so much
that I got goose skin.
- Do you think it's possible that...?
- It's impossible, Mew.
There are a lot of lookalikes.

So, Mew, how have you been?
Fine. Playing music is fun.
You are alone. Aren't you lonely?
Frighteningly lonely.
What is it? Frighteningly lonely?
Like when we were kids.
We were so lonely because we
didn't have friends, right?
When we grew up. *******
Loneliness is much worse
than that. ********
Why was it so bad for you?
I don't know what to say.
It started during the summer
when I was in grade 8.
Papa took grandma somewhere
for 3 or 4 days.
- And the day she came back...
- My friend...
I heard that when I was away,
you were so stubborn.
It's not easy at all,
because the longer she's gone
the more I missed grandma.
So I got one question.
If we love someone so much
Can we take it, that one day
we will be apart? ********
And... that being apart
is a part of life?
You know it well, Tong.
Is it possible, Tong?
That we love someone, and
we're not afraid of losing them.

At the same time, I was wondering...
Is it possible...
that we can live without
loving anyone at all?
That's my loneliness...
I have lived with it for 5 years.
Why wouldn't I know
how bad it treated me. *******
What about my life from now on. *******
Mew.
Hope you got home safely. Mew

Aex!
Try again.
Ok. Go ahead.
Using a computer, then why are we here?
Hey. It's ok.
Enough, enough. Aex. Enough.
Hey, stay calm. Start over, ok?

Joy, I did it, but no reaction.
If you like him,
why don't you just tell him directly?
Why believe that sort of book?
If you believe in it,
you'll never have a boyfriend.
- Nonsense, isn't it?
- Ahh.
I got it from your house, Joy.
Oh, it's mine?
Her house doesn't have
book. Are you sure?
********
Hello girls.
This is my friend, Tong.
- Hello.
- Ahh.
- Ahh.
- Sit down. Sit.
Use the microphone. Behind you.
Aex, when you played the guitar,
did you tune it up?
That's ok. Start over.
- June, June.
- Yes.
- Get a pack of Paracetamol for me.
- Ok.
One pack is enough?
Ying, why don't you eat?
She is doing some voodoo stuff.
Better leave her alone.
Voodoo? What are you doing?
Just don't listen to her.
I'm on diet.
Let me tell you
She saw in the book
that if you want someone to love,
you have stick his
hair into a Teddy bear
and don't eat meat for 3 days.
Who do you like, Ying?
It's her neighbor.

JOY...
None of your business.
- Let me out.
- Where are you going?
Wait for me. Where are you going?
Hey. I think it's getting weird.
I think it's getting weird.
Hey. Hey.
Gosh, so who will pay now?
- I don't have enough.
- Neither do I.
- I don't have either.
- I don't know. I'm just gonna eat now.
What's the matter with you?
Oh.
Your mom is here.
Go.

That day I was still angry at you
So I didn't want to come.
That's it.
Is this one pretty?
It's pretty.
What about this one?
Also pretty.
So which one is better?
Which one do you like?
I don't know. I like both of them.
Tong, can you help me choose?
I don't know how to choose ear rings.
Can you buy one for me?
Ok.

Do you want it, Tong?
Excuse me, can you give me a discount on
the wooden doll there?
Can't go lower.
It's already cheap!
Can I buy just a part of it?
Are you crazy?
Who would sell it that way?
What would I do with the rest of it?
Tong, why don't you buy the whole thing?
Because I bought the earrings for you,
so I don't have enough money.

Is it that important to you?
I've never seen you
interested in such toys.
It's not for me.
Who are you buying it for?
For my friend.
Friend.
Which friend?
Is it a girl?
A guy.
For your friend, you are
so willing to buy. *****
You are underage.
I can't sell it to you.
Only 3 months away.
It doesn't matter. It's the law.
What do you want?
A pack of Green LM,
and a pack of Paracetamol.
What's the total?
- 56.
- How much?
56?
Smoking is not good for you.
Want to see Mew at the Studio?
It's fun.
Is it going to be late?
Umm. I still don't know.
Might be...
I can't make it then.
My mom is on her way to pick me up.
Your mom is still picking you up?
I better go.
June, please say hi to Mew for me.
Ok, I'll tell him.
Mom.
Umm.
Isn't there someone who can
help him to get better?
Who? Who's helping whom?

Aww, So loud! Quiet!

99 thornless red rose...
Mom.
Wait. What did you say
about the job you are doing?
I'm taking care of music bands.
And the one before this?
Just freelances
Event organizers,
and Filming Studios
Where are you from?
Chiangmai.
What about your family?
They all passed away.
So, who do you stay with?
Just by myself.
And...
What about the extra job
that we are here to talk?
Umm...
It may sound a little strange...
Dad!

Where have you been...?
I'm back, Dad.
Who'll lead the prayers?
Let Tang do it.
But we haven't done it for a long time.
It's ok.
It's ok. Tang can lead it.
- Every dishes of rice...
- In the name of...
Every dishes of food,
we won't waste them
They are precious.
Farmers are working hard.
Not an easy life.
Think of the poor.
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Is that a new prayer?
They are Christian.
Ah. Ah.
Their prayers are like this, dad.
Why don't you tell us
what it's like over there?
After you got lost in the jungle
that you told me in the car. ******
Ah. It's. *****
After I got hit by a car, right?
They're hill tribes. Two of them.
They saved my life.
When I woke up
they said they saved my life.
My memory is incoherent.
They took care of me. They fed me.
They made food for me.
At first we couldn't communicate much.
But. Enough to live. ******
It's fine.
Can we start the meal?
Let's eat before it gets cold.

Some fish, dad?
Fish is so delicious.
It's good for your brain too.
Can you handle it?
It's ok. But I can only
make it periodically. ******
If he gets up...
And doesn't see me, is
that going to be alright? *******
I don't know either.
I don't even know if
he will remember this.
What's this?
Please take it.
Thank you very much.
- Umm. June?
- Huh?
How did you come up with so many details
for the jungle story?
It's from the movie 'Ruk Jung'.
Ruk Jung?
Rattapoom and Paula.
Ahh.
See you later.
Bye.
Mew, this is so sweet.
Did you write it for someone?
Just don't give me weird chords again.
Think of the guitar player too.
Do we have this song in our audition?
What's up, Tong?
Ahh.
Where are you now?
Today?
Yes.
Ok. *****
ja.
So, I'll see you soon.
Umm.
Why don't you continue?
Umm. Tang, you're not going to school?
I don't go to school anymore, dad.
I can't leave you alone like this, dad.
How could I?
You should take the medicine
and drink a lot of water,
so I can go back to school again.
I'll put the plates away.

What is this?
? ? ?
Ahh. Dad wants to play...
the gift hunt game with you.
***** (treasure hunt? )
What game?
It's a game we played when we were kids.
It means there's something
he wants to give you, June.
Really?
Are there any more pieces?
Yes, you wrapped your chewing gum
and threw out already. ******
Is it going to be ok?
Don't worry. Tomorrow he
will have forgotten about this.
Really?
I better go now.
- See you later.
- Bye, June.
Tong, are you available this Sunday?

We'll have a party for June.
Would that really be a good idea?
That's what I thought.
But dad wants to do it.
Nobody can say no.
This means...
things are getting better
at your house, right?
Who's that?
Old friend.
Let me drink just today.
Doctor, you drink too?
- Tang. How are you?
- Umm.
I'm Aey, Aui's girlfriend.
- Ahh. Hello.
- Don't pretend not to remember us.
You grew up so much.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Make yourself at home.
After I stayed with the hill tribes,
I moved to Chiangmai.
That's why. And didn't
you want to come home?
I lost my memory.
So I couldn't remember the way.
Sounds like 'Ruk Jung'
movie, doesn't it?
It's so similar to that movie.
Until June. Ooops, Tang remember...
******
It was so long ago.
- Tang.
- Huh?
Let's get some ice.
Oh, I should get some ice.
Please excuse us.
Let's don't say too much,
It's gonna get out of control.
Why? This is fun.
If people find out about it,
it's not going to be fun anymore.
C'mon, don't get too serious.
This is a party.
Let's go to see Mew sing.
Let me take this.
And this is our new song.
We have never played it anywhere.
It will be the first time at this party.
Anyway, let's listen to it.
# If I say that I wrote
this song for you,
# would you believe me?
# It might not be as well-written
and beautiful as other songs
# I want you to know that you can't write
# a love song if you're not in love
# But for you, I can write
this song so easily
# You might have heard hundreds
or thousands of love songs
# They might be meaningful,
but their meanings are for anyone
# When you listen to this song,
it is written for you only
# If you understand the meaning,
our hearts will be together#
Do you know?
Tang is the most enviable girl.
Why is that?
I don't know. When I grew up,
nobody has arranged a
party like this for me.
- So I just feel that Tang. *******
- It's not.
It's not like that.
Because when she was with us,
we never had something
like this for her.
Can I ask you something?
Do you think Tang is still here...
or is she gone?

That song. It's so beautiful.
How did you write it?
Umm. Without you,
there won't be such a song.
What do you say after listening to it?
I don't know.
What is it?
Are you alright?
Do you want me to pick
you up this evening?
It's ok, mom.
I'll go home by myself.
Mew...
Mew, what kind of relationship
are you having with Tong?
We're friends...
Last night, I saw you
and Tong at my house
I understand it now.
Mew, listen to me carefully.
Mew, you know what my family
has to cope with, right?
You know what we have lost, right?
Tong is the only one we have left
and I don't want to see him taking
a path that is not right.
What?
In the future, when Tong has graduated,
he has to find a job,
save money, and look for a good wife,
get married and have a happy family
where they can take care of
each other when they grow old.
That is life, Mew
I took care of him
so that he grows up that way.
Mew, would you do it for Tong?
Stop this kind of relationship with him.
I think it doesn't matter
what kind of love you have for Tong.
You want to see him happy,
and that he has a good life.
Aunty Sunee,
we are just friends.
One day you will understand, Mew.
Tong. Do you want me to pick you up?
*****
I called him, Pingpong,
but his phone was off.
Anyone has problems with him?

I don't know either.
June, can you help us look for him?
As soon as I get out of here,
I'll look for him.
Yes. Yes. Ok.
One moment,
let me check one moment.
So slow
Is he gonna show up?
Of course. Of course he will.
Is everything alright?
Tong. Tong!
- Where are you going?
- My friend's house.
Whose house?
Mew's house.
I can't let you go
You can't go to Mew's house anymore.
Why not?
I know about everything,
and I have talked to him.
You went to see Mew?

Do you know what you have done?
Do you know?
Why wouldn't I know what I'm doing?
You are not me.
You are not our family.
What would you know?
Mew!
Mew!
Mew! Are you there?
Come down. Talk to me.
Mew!
Aww. Be quiet! Everybody is asleep.
Stop yelling,
go look elsewhere! Go!

You are always like this.
- Who would stand it?
- What about you?
Everyday, only drinking
******
Have you known any of our problems?
- Have you ever listened
to other people?
Why do I have to!
Why do I have to listen
to a loser like you!
Aww!
Hurry up.
- Hey!
- Come, come, come.
Are you drunk?
- Sit, sit, sit.
- This is slow. *****
I was waiting for him.
Looks like you've got problems.
When you're happy,
you won't come to see us, right?
Doesn't matter.
Just give him one set.
Why don't you get them here?
Hey. Hey.
You two.
Your friends are here,
come in and drink.
Drink. Drink.
Let's drink! ! You'll forget it soon.
Salute...
I know what's going on,
but I still have to find a reason
to tell Aod.
Because last night,
when you didn't show up,
it was a big problem.
I was sick.
Aod told me to ask you
what you want to do.
We have already booked
for Christmas Festival.
Will you be there?
I'll try.
What have I done?
This is what I deserve, isn't it?
Whatever I do these days is
still not good enough, is it?
What do you want to
be when you grow up?
I want to be a director.
What's this?
Yes, yes, we can go.
Hey Tong, let me ask you
about Donut.
Why?
Donut is your girlfriend.
Why don't you pay some attention to her?
That's right.
Can I ask you straight forward.
Just answer, yes or no.
Are you gay?
Hey?
Some friends saw you walking
with a boy from St. Nicholas.
Where did you get that?
- From Whae.
- Aww! Bad things you throw at me.
But I really heard it.
That you were walking with a boy
from St. Nicholas at Siam Square.
So... are you?
You guys. This is such a nonsense.
So it's true.
You are gay.
Ahh. I haven't said anything.
- You said he's gay.
- Bastard, I haven't said a word.
Oh, she's gone again. What about me?
You told them about me?
No, Tong, I didn't.
- I don't know about...
- Do you want to know so much?
It's not like that, Tong.
- You want to know so much what I am!
- It's not like that, Tong!
Tong. It's not.
What am I, Ying?
What happened to me?
It's ok, Tong.
It's ok.
People are upset because
I don't know what I am.
It will get better.
Ehh. Why has Tong a black eye?
A Football hit his face
Dad, don't you remember that
all the time in Chiangmai
his eye looked like a panda,
all the time during the trip.
Where were you in this picture?
That time I already
went with my friends...
I think you asked someone there
to take this picture.
Dad. Are you alright?
You look exhausted.
I think you better take a rest.
Wait.
Where did you get those stories?
I made them all up!
It's just the story he wanted to hear.
June, can you tell me who you are?
Why? I am June.
No! I meant, where you're from?
Who are your parents?
I already told you everything!
Can you tell me one more time?
I want to hear all of them.
Why would you want to know?
I hired you, I have the right to know.
I can't just hire a
stranger from somewhere...
to stay in my house.
I think you got that right.
I am just a stranger.
Honey? Honey?
Honey!

Where is Tang...?
What is this?
What happens to you?
June! June!
The number you're calling
is not available
Tang, can you call Tong?
The number you're calling...
When the liver gets in this condition
it affects his blood pressure
blood vessels in his intestine were
damaged.
So it became like this

How serious is this?
More than 80% of the liver was damaged.
At this stage, we just have
to hope for the best.
The number you're calling...
When I decided to come
to Bangkok to study,
my parents didn't want me to go,
because they didn't have much money.
But I finally came here
because I thought, if
I stay in Chiangmai
my life couldn't become much
better than what it was.
But once I got here
I didn't contact them again.
I just thought that my life had to be
at another level before I could go home.
I couldn't go back to
let them laugh at me.
Do you know what happened?
When I had brrn working,
and I had saved some money,
I went back home
and discovered that my parents
weren't there anymore.
They had passed away shortly after
I went to Bangkok.
What happened?
It was an accident.
I don't even know what kind of accident.
I don't want to know.
I just know that they're gone.
I did everything I could
just to make them happy
without knowing that they were
already dead.
They died,
and I didn't have a chance
to make anything better for them,
to apologize
or to let them know
how much I loved them.
But you are still so lucky...
Is this real, or did
you just make that up...
to make me feel better, huh?
Is it too bright for you?

Where's mom?
What?
Where's mom?
She went to get something.
Do you want anything, dad?
Will I make it and get out of here?
Yes.
Dad...
I have something to tell you...
Mom.
Where have you been?
Tong! Don't you go to school?
The doctor prescribed an antitoxin
and it helps a lot.
He can go home in a couple of days.
Although my presence helps him
getting better,
he never stops drinking.
What we have been doing,
does it really help to improve things?
Dad...
I have to go back for a while.
Bye...
Tang.
Will you come back for Christmas?
It might have been a long time
It might have been so far away
That we were waking...
Continue...
[Chinese song]
[From Ying's Place]
Mew. What are you doing?
Ahh. This song. This song.
- This song?
- Yes.
Do you want to borrow it?
No need, just a little part of it.
I just want to memorize it.
Umm. Most Chinese
songs have good meanings.
Ying, what does this part mean?
- Where?
- Here.
I don't know it either, Mew.
I'll ask my brother for you.
Ok.
Mew. Now I know what it means.
And... what does it mean?
It means, as long as you love,
you still have hope.
So, Ying, are you still hoping?
And should I still hope?
Ying, you are a good friend of mine.
Why, grandma.
Why...
So, who will sing?
This one.
We are thinking of
changing the lead singer.
because nobody has
seen your faces before
If he can sing, I'm fine with it.
What about the composer of the song?
Let's do this, June!
June!
Talk to him nicely.
- Sit down.
- Yes.
June, you know the problems
of August Band, right?
Yes, I do.
And do you know what I hired you for?
- To take care of August Band.
- Right.
On everything.
Doesn't matter what it is.
Now they have a big problem.
Where have you been?
When I told you to manage the rehersal,
you were gone, you were late.
I don't understand it, June.
I think,
it might be a good idea for
you to try something else.
Forgot something?
Take some food and medicines too.

How are you doing?
It's the same...
Aren't you going to come back?
I have to go now.
Let me give you this.
- What is it?
- Open it at home. You'll see.
Ok, you better go...
Your friends are here...
Tong.
Your family is the best.
Please take care of one another.

Why are you so mad at me?
I wasn't angry when
you got us into trouble,
but I just don't understand why
you have changed so much.
What do you want?
If I am the cause of your anger,
I apologize...
I'm not angry at you.
I just can't sing these songs anymore.
Why?
I'm not in the mood for singing anymore.
You won't understand.
Although I don't understand you,
you are still my friend.
Why do you always think that
nobody cares about you?
Are you tired, mom?
Of what?
Of everything.
Of course, I'm tired.
What can I do?
What about you?
How's everything?
Good. I don't know.
It's fine, mom.
Could you turn on the light?
Tong, help me put the
ornaments on the tree.
Is it good here, mom?
Just put it around...
What about this on here instead, mom?
Just put it on...
What about two of these together here?
Just go ahead, ok!
What if I put them on
and you don't like it...
You'll be upset again.
Do as you please.
'Let's go to Christmas
Festival together...Donut'
*****
I don't know, Tong.
You have to decide...

Do you want to buy it, Tong?
Huh. But I just want the nose.
It's too much to buy the whole thing.
Umm. Just a moment
I'll get it for you
Please. Please.
Give me, please.
What about the rest of the pieces?
I really beg you, please...
- Alright.
- Thank you so much! !
- Take it...
- Thank you so much. You're very kind! !
Thank you so much!
'I'll wait for you at Center
Point at 6:30...Donut'
Tong...
- Don't come home too late.
- Yes, mom...
Have you seen June lately?
No. Why?
Will she come?
Mom... There's something
in the kitchen cupboard.
What?
Nothing, mom. Nothing.
I gotta go...
'I'm here waiting...Donut'
Now it's the moment
everyone is waiting for.
Let me check.
Are you ok down there?
You are late again.
Should we go now?
I'm sorry,
I have something to tell you...
Just tell me when we get there.
Hurry up!
We are late...
Now it's time to see them...
The August Band!
Hurry up!
# If I say that I wrote this song for you,
# would you believe me?
# It might not be as well-written
and beautiful as other songs
# I want you to know that
you can't write a love song
# if you're not in love
# But for you, I can write
this song so easily
# You might have heard hundreds
- # or thousands of love songs...#
- Donut, I'm really sorry.
I can't go with you, Donut.
Aww. You said you would.
Umm... I meant...
We can't be together anymore.
I'm really sorry.
Why didn't you tell me earlier,
so I could go with other people?
# If you understand the meaning,
our hearts will be together
# Let it be the song
# on the way along with
only your and my voice
# that will be together for so long
# Just like a verse in a poem.
# As long as you love,
you still have hope.
# Every time I see your
love shining in my heart,
# I can see my destiny...

I have been thinking.
How would you take it... from now on.
But I believe so hard
that you can make it
without me,
because you have so much
love for one another
Even though, sometimes,
it seems to be so much...
that it hurts you,
but I believe...
when time goes by...
we would all understand...
that there is no such
thing as 'too much love'.
# There are so many truths in love
# In the past, I spent a lot of time
looking for the meaning of it
# but I just knew that
every time you are near
# that if life is a melody,
# you are the lyrics to
make it meaningful
# and make life a beautiful music
# Let it be the song on the way along
with only your and my voice
# that will be together for so long
# Just like a verse in a poem.
# As long as you love,
you still have hope.
# Every time I see your
love shining in my heart,
# I can see my destiny...

Even if it led us.
into making some mistakes
but it's better than never trying
anything...
to find love at all. Isn't that right?
Life always give us opportunities
to start over
after the lesson of the mistakes
I hope you take the
opportunities you still have...
to take good care of one another
Thank you for everything.
If there's a chance, we
might see each other again...
What is this?
It's when we went to Chiangmai together.
At that time, she was
already gone, right?
Not yet...
Four of us were there,
but Tang wanted to take the photo.
Look at you.
You smiled so proudly
that Tang finally learned
how to take a photo.
It might be just a tiny thing
but it's one of the few occasions
when Tang made us proud of her,
Korn.
You.
I knew.
I've always known.
Hey. Your friend's here.
Where have you been?
Where's Tong?
He's probably home.
He's probably gone home.
He is Christian,
probably gone home to see Santa Clause.
But Santa from your dad's
house comes today!
Santa comes tomorrow! You're stupid!
- Today!
- Tomorrow!
Hey. What's the matter?

Hey, what's wrong...?
Hey. Are you ok?
Why are you crying?
You can talk to us...
Mew.
Hey Tong.
The music was great!
What do you say after listening to it?
Umm...
I can't be with you as a boyfriend.
But that doesn't mean
that I don't love you, Mew.
Thank you.
Umm. I have to go.
They're waiting.
Wait, Mew.
Aa. I give you this.
What is it?
It's a Christmas present.
Thank you.
Umm. I better go.
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

Hey. What? Let me see...
Did she show up?
No.
She won't be back again.
From now on, there's only us, son.
Thank you...
