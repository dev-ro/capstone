Everything all right, Sybil ?
I'm fine. What's taking Alicia so long ?
We have a doctor's appointment in 40 minutes.
She's not here.
She has to be. I saw her
leave for school this morning.
Alicia hasn't been in any of her classes.
April, get off the phone.
I can't talk right now.
Somebody took Alicia !
What did you do ?! What
the hell did you do ?!
Mom, I don't know... Where is she ?!
- I'm not sure.
- Where is she ?!
Get off of me ! Go find my daughter !
Go find my daughter !
I don't get to see Alicia all that much.
Um, I don't get to.
Her life sucks, so sometimes she would just,
you know, play hooky and spend the day with me.
After girls' day out, you
stopped here for a snack.
- Your father ?
- Yeah. Um...
I was just went in, and...
you know, to get something while
she changed back into her uniform.
- In the car ?
- It's not that big of a deal.
It's like, you know,
the skirt over the jeans,
and back to school before Mom knows anything.
So what did he look like ?
What kind of car did he drive ?
Alicia !
A black guy, uh...
He had a beard and he
had a crappy black Buick.
But, um... I don't know, maybe it was blue.
- I don't really...
- No, that's... that's good.
You did good. That's good. Thank you.
The cops won't tell us.
What are the chances of
finding our daughter ?
We're doing everything we can.
That's what everyone keeps saying.
No one will tell us anything.
Did you injure yourself, Mrs. Perez ?
Oh, a nosebleed.
That's a lot of blood.
I'm going to need to take your shirt.
Why ?
If you like, I can have someone
follow you home so that you can change.
You think we had something to do with it ?
Our daughter is missing.
She's out there somewhere alone and scared.
- What are you doing about that ?!
- I'm just collecting evidence.
Fine. Here ! Take it !
Go find her !
Episode 5x03 Harvest
This is Captain Jim Brass.
I want to issue a Missing
Persons Emergency Alert Amber.
Notify all radio and casino signatories.
The description is as follows...
We have breaking news from the
Channel 8 newsroom right now.
An Amber Alert has been issued for
missing 13-year-old Alicia Perez.
The suspect in Alicia's abduction is
described as an African American man,
35 to 45 years old, about six feet tall.
- How'd you shoot, man ?
- Rusty.
They say I have a flinch.
You and I need to go practice some, huh ?
Yeah, when do we have time to do that ?
If we're not processing a scene or
working evidence, we're in court.
Well, when they take your
piece, you'll make time.
This girl seemed a little old
to be lured by a lost puppy.
So how'd this guy pull this
off in a lot this public ?
Easy. With a map and a smile.
Rolls up : "Hey, little girl,
I'm lost. You from around here ?"
She gets close enough he pulls her out
of her sister's car, into his car...
- Bam, she's done.
- I bet he had a weapon.
Threatened her, so he could drive.
Probably used his fists.
Bastard had to have hit her.
Look, dude, I didn't see it.
Chica had a nice, round ass
and that's what I was scoping.
- What time was that ?
- About 3:00.
She comes in, grabs some candy,
looks outside, waves at somebody.
The next thing I know, she flips her wig.
She's screaming about her sister.
I didn't see the girl or a car.
Besides, there's a lot of traffic out there.
- Was it busy ?
- Kind of.
How many surveillance
cameras do you have in here ?
Inside we got five.
They're all
state-of-the-art.
Place gets hit a lot.
Outside they're all dummies.
Well, I'm glad to see you're so concerned
about your customers after they leave the store.
Hello.
Who's calling ? Yeah.
Nick, you failed firearms
qualification. You can't be here.
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm taking
it again day after tomorrow,
- so I figured I could work.
- Not in the field.
You're serious ?
You're in violation just carrying the weapon.
Copy that. I'll be in the lab.
Uh, Nick, let me catch a lift with you.
There's something going on with Lindsey.
I'm Catherine Willows. What's the trouble ?
With the Amber Alert, we've
been keeping an eye out.
Found your daughter up on Boulder
Highway trying to hitch a ride downtown.
Now, kids this age, they need
a firm hand at home, and...
Thank you, officer. I appreciate
everything you've done.
Let's go.
Okay, what or who is on Fremont Street
that you would risk your life to get to ?
Mouthing off to teachers, slipping
grades and now hitchhiking.
I mean, what is next, Lindsey ?
- Stripping.
- What did you just say ?
Okay, no phone, no friends, no nothing.
- For how long ?
- A month.
- Whatever.
- Hey, you want to make it two ?
Dad always said you were a drama queen.
Well, what do you expect,
Lindsey, since he was always high.
I'd take Dad high over you any day !
Nana's coming to pick
me up. I'll be out front.
- You paged.
- Yeah.
What's missing ?
I give up.
Her sister said the victim changed
back into her school uniform in the car.
So where are the clothes she changed out of ?
Hello.
- Mia Dickerson, Warrick Brown.
- Welcome.
Look, I already know you have a running bet with
another CSI over how long the new hire lasts,
so let's skip it. You got something for DNA ?
- The mother's bloody
T-shirt. - Exemplar ?
It's on its way.
- Just hedging my bets.
- How so ?
Well, I need field experience, but before
I get that, I need to find a replacement.
So far, I'm
o-for-one.
Plus, she's hot and thinks
you're a tool, so I'm way ahead.
A gardener and a pool
man come in once a week.
- How long have they worked for you ?
- Years.
How about a housekeeper or a maid ?
I do it.
Let's talk about your daughter's routines.
Her routes to and from school,
any extra-curricular
activities, a list of friends.
There wasn't any after school stuff.
Alicia isn't a joiner. She walks
to school, I pick her up. That's it.
How often did April get
her sister to skip school ?
We don't know. We... we
just found out ourselves.
I'm curious because April said
she hardly ever gets to see Alicia.
- Why didn't she just come here ?
- Because she wasn't welcome.
- We kicked her out.
- April's a troubled girl.
Problems with drugs, the police.
You might as well know,
she also did some time.
- Juvenile lockup.
- For what ?
Heroin possession. Intent to distribute.
There's nothing suspicious on the server.
Only hits are music downloads.
Wait a minute. An organ transplant site.
For kidneys, heart, lungs and liver.
- What is that, homework research ?
- Maybe.
These are pretty detailed biochem
and immunosuppressant citations.
It's a little over a seventh
grader's head, don't you think ?
I don't know. I bet you were
a pretty smart seventh grader.
She has a serious crush
on a boy named Jimmy Jones.
Sara. "I hate Mom & Dad."
Who doesn't once in a while ?
Daniel Perez. And you are... ?
Gil Grissom, Sara Sidle, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I guess that's why you're pawing
through my sister's private stuff.
It's going to help us find
her. Do you know a Jimmy Jones ?
Yeah, a boy from school. She liked him.
What's your sister like ?
Personable, friendly,
outgoing, trusting, maybe ?
She's a giver
- from the day she was born.
Uh, Daniel... you're bleeding.
I'm sorry.
You want to know my sister, you should
check her diary under the mattress.
"Last night I didn't sleep very good.
I kept thinking about the surgery."
I guess we know why she was
doing transplant research.
Serious illness takes a toll on a family.
Alicia never complained.
She's used to the doctors.
She has friends there - people who
understand - go through the same hell.
You know, if a victim has a serious illness,
you really should disclose it right away.
Our daughter isn't sick.
Our son's kidneys are failing.
Alicia is his matching donor.
Without her, he'd die.
Well, Alicia was a great half-back
strong right leg, aggressive.
You don't see that too much in girls.
- She played soccer ?
- Yeah, for awhile.
She quit before she got cut.
She missed a lot of practice 'cause
she was always going to the doctor,
and you can't really play
with one kidney anyway, so...
- She told you about her brother ?
- Yeah, on the way to school.
Hell, I thought that it was cool that she was
saving his life, but she seemed pretty pissed.
- Jimmy... language.
- Sorry.
Anyway, uh, she didn't seem too happy.
She said she had no life and never would.
So, Jimmy, on your way to and from school,
did anyone ever bother you
or approach you in any way ?
Um... there was this one guy,
with a track suit, he was
supposed to be running.
- He gave me the creeps.
- What gave you the creeps ?
Well, start with his gear. I
mean, nobody runs in velour.
And he never had any water
and he was always on the phone.
- What'd he look like ?
- Black guy.
He was not a runner, but he was in shape.
Bald, mustache, beard.
How old would you say he is, Jimmy ?
Old... like 30.
I just... never liked the
way he looked at Alicia.
Thanks. You've been a great
help, Jimmy. Thank you.
Uh, if it's okay with your mom, I'm going
to have you hang around, look at some photos.
- All right ?
- Sure.
Here's the Perez house,
Alicia's walk route to school,
and the convenience
store where she was taken.
All the locations are within a
half-mile, plus or minus three-tenths.
This is a map of all registered
sex offenders in the state,
the county, and the neighborhood.
Phew ! That's a lot of perverts.
Get out of jail, come to Vegas.
They're listed in tiers of projected
recidivism, zero through three.
Three being the most dangerous.
They're the ones most likely to plan an abduction
and find the privacy for sexual assault and murder.
If I remove the zeroes and ones,
since they have a low or moderate risk
designation, this is what we're left with.
- That's still a lot of perverts.
- Mm, maybe not.
Here, I'll isolate the Perez neighborhood.
Marlon Waylord, Tier Two,
38, black, lives alone,
sometimes handyman and fits
Jimmy Jones' description.
Officer.
Did you, uh, cut yourself
shaving, Mr. Waylord.
- Marlon must be shy.
- Marlon didn't do nothing.
And I believe you, too. Come
on, step over here, please.
You all know that sex offenders under a felony
conviction have absolutely no unconditional release
and are under lifetime supervision, automatically
assigned by the Nevada Criminal State Justice system.
Mandated, of course, by state and
federal Megan's Law in effect 5/17/96.
And therefore I am required to
register and update my information...
whenever I move from my
current, uh, domicile.
Well, that's a big word.
Well, you got all your facts right, Marlon.
Help us with this one.
We know you own a Buick. Where is it ?
Tangiers' parking lot.
- It wouldn't start.
- I hate that.
- I'll have it towed to the lab.
- You do that.
Presence of semen.
There's children's underwear in the bedroom.
Photos of children on his
phone, including Alicia.
So here's the deal : when you go up,
- I won't yell short eyes first.
- How's that sound ?
Sounds like a really good deal...
you know, if I was, um, guilty.
The inmates didn't treat
you too gentle the last time.
Did they ?
- You know they didn't.
- So tell me what you did with Alicia.
Who ?
She's been all over the news, non-stop.
It's that why you shaved ?
Oh, don't make me smack you.
Her friend tells us that you
were always looking at her.
You went out in the morning
and watched them go to school.
She's sweet, very sweet, but, fellas...
I wasn't looking at her.
You all should check my file.
No, I did.
I know that your recent
preference is for little boys,
but, uh, your first time
was with a female cousin.
Let me read what you said.
"I couldn't help myself
'cause she was acting so hot.
It was her fault ; she was really hot."
How does a
six-year-old act hot ?
- Listen...
- I'm, uh... I'm sick.
You know, I got this-this
this illness, which... Look.
I don't want to go back to prison.
That's why I'm being so compliant.
Now, yo, I don't work near no little kids.
I stay a hundred yards
from the school grounds.
- Man, I don't even go to the park.
- It's not a disease. It's a compulsion.
I stay away from youth organizations,
after-school programs, churches...
We found a pair of boy's
underwear in your bedroom.
- Explain that.
- I look at the photos.
I look at the photos and I have
the briefs for, um... release.
So you fantasize, and eventually, the
fantasy's not enough and you relapse.
Hey, they're mine. I bought the underwear !
Well, if that's true, then you were in a store where
little children were shopping with their mothers.
And what would you have me do, huh, man ?
What ?!
I mean, I even thought
about chemical castration.
Medroxyprogesterone is inconclusive.
It renders the subject incapable of erection,
but it doesn't remove the sex drive.
You would still be capable of
sexual assault using other objects.
Listen...
Um, I haven't done anything, uh, illegal,
so you can't hold me in here forever.
Oh, is that killing look in your
eyes a compulsion, Mr. Grissom ?
What's up ?
The seminal fluid on the boy's
underwear matches your pedophile.
- Epithelials ?
- His. And only his.
That confirms his story that
the briefs were never worn.
- Hair ?
- Synthetic.
- Probably from a wig.
- Great.
That means we have to let the bastard go.
It's only a matter of time
before he snatches up another kid.
You got any friends in uniform ?
Yeah, but they can't watch him indefinitely.
Okay, look. Megan's Law has holes.
Police aren't required to notify
a community about a predator.
So flood his block with
flyers detailing his crimes.
Trust me, the neighbors won't
let him out of their sight.
Or they'll kill him.
They found Alicia Perez.
A tour helicopter spotted
her around 4:00 p.m.
How many people have walked
through the crime scene ?
Just the responding officers,
lug soles, sizes 10 and 11.
We're going to need some time here, Jim.
Yeah, well, there's no rush now.
She's wrapped up pretty tight.
Protecting her against
insects and carrion, maybe.
Somebody, uh, wanted her intact.
Well, her face is covered, that means
remorse, guilt... somebody cared.
She's been re-dressed.
- Her panties are missing.
- All right.
360-degree grid search.
Sometimes rapists like to relive the event.
He may have wanted to watch her.
So keep the body in view.
We're looking for shoe
prints, sperm clusters...
anything else you can find.
90 degrees ?
Given the timeline, it should be higher.
That-that can't be right.
Well, today's temp., last night's weather...
may have had something to do with it.
No signs of sexual assault.
No defensive wounds. No wounds of any kind.
Were you expecting some ?
Well, she was wrapped in a bloody blanket.
Since there's no trauma, maybe
the blood belongs to her killer.
Roll her.
Look at those marks.
There was nothing underneath
her at the crime scene that, uh,
would've made those.
Well, maybe she was moved.
- Trunk of a car ?
- Tire iron ?
Yeah, but there's, uh, two impressions,
and they're too long to be a lug wrench.
- Have you been to bed ?
- Yeah.
Did you sleep ?
Me neither.
She was the same age as Lindsey.
She was trying to hitchhike.
- Where was she going ?
- Fremont Street.
- Was she buying drugs ?
- No ! She's 12.
She's... just so angry.
She doesn't talk to me.
Well, if enough people knew
what was out there hunting them,
they'd never leave their house.
I think you need to sit her down.
Well, I don't want to scare her.
I don't want my daughter to be this...
frightened, paranoid kid who's
always looking over her shoulder.
Katherine, there's a big difference
between scaring her and preparing her.
And all the reasons why
you should are in that room.
What is all this bone scarring ?
I thought you should be interested.
12 holes exactly made by a large bore needle.
Marrow harvest ?
Young Alicia donated bone
marrow at least twice.
Pretty selfless thing to do once,
considering how painful the procedure is.
Let me ask you : what most
likely causes shortness of breath,
obvious bruising, sudden
nosebleeds, petechiae ?
Sounds like acute leukemia,
but without immunophenotyping,
I couldn't tell you what kind.
- Alicia's cause of death ?
- Cardiopulmonary arrest.
- Time of death ?
- That's a little trickier.
No solids in the stomach
contents, just a milky liquid.
Liver mortis was fixed and deep purple with a
vitreous humor potassium level of 20
millimoles per liter with faint putrefaction.
So, I'd say she's been dead about...
44 hours between midnight and 8:00
a.m., the day of her kidnapping.
Which means April Perez was
lying about the abduction.
Yep. Story's got more holes
than her sister's bones.
I bought it The hell we all bought it.
But your sister was already
dead when you raised that alarm.
Her body told us that.
There was no sexual assault.
The evidence told us that, too.
So you didn't think this through, sweetheart.
So what are we left with ?
A false police report and
a murdered little girl.
So it's one to four for the Amber Alert.
And for your sister, life
imprisonment if it's an accident,
and the needle if it's not.
I didn't kill Alicia.
But you know, I get it. I get the picture.
I mean, your brother's
the center of attention.
He's sick, he's dying.
Your cells don't match.
Your parents have Alicia.
She's his savior.
So, where do you fit in ?
- What are you to this family ?
- I'm invisible.
But not anymore you're not.
She's dead, and your brother's sick.
- When he goes...
- That's crazy, okay.
I told you, I didn't kill my sister.
I want to believe that.
Come on. Help me to believe that.
It just means you were in on it
because you put on one hell of a show.
- You still using ?
- No.
Maybe we should run your
blood just to be sure, huh ?
I use now and then to take the edge off.
So how do you pay for this habit ?
Are you pimping your
sister for drugs, April ?
Why don't you make up your mind ?
No signs of rape.
If I was selling my sister,
there would be, wouldn't there ?
Depends on who you sold it to.
You're not gonna talk
your way out of this one.
You need to get clean.
What I need is a lawyer,
which means this conversation is over.
Daniel Perez was diagnosed with
relapsing acute promyelocytic leukemia
or APL when he was ten.
It's rare, it's nasty, and
it usually hits Hispanics.
His sister, Alicia was conceived
in vitro to be a genetic match.
Well, it's not unheard of.
Have a baby, get the undeveloped
stem cells from cord blood.
New parents are even storing it now.
But when she was four, they
took her blood for a transfusion.
- No... no !
- It's okay, sweetheart.
At seven, they took her
blood to remove stem cells.
Well, Daniel must have relapsed
because they took bone marrow twice.
It takes one to one-and-a-half liters
of marrow for a successful harvest.
A living DNA factory.
- I don't need help.
- I know.
I'm just trying to make
the transition seamless.
Forget I'm here.
So would you like to grab a bite later ?
I know a diner down the street
that serves a mean liver and onions.
- I don't eat out.
- Never ever ?
- I don't like expectorant.
- Really ?
Kitchen staff talk while
they prepare your food
and then the wait staff repeats
your order over the plate,
and by the time you get your meal,
there are several DNA samples coating it.
- Wow.
- No, thank you.
I don't eat birthday cake either.
- Oh, blowing out the candles.
- Ugh. Don't get me started.
Excuse me.
Um... what happens to April now ?
She is being charged and processed
and the court will probably grant her bill.
- Do you know how much... ?
- Why ?
She's my daughter.
She's refusing to talk about what happened
to your youngest child, Mrs. Perez.
I can't leave her in jail.
I think it might be the best place for her.
This is my fault.
I... I was never there for her. I...
Why don't we step in here, please ?
I spent all my energy
getting Daniel to the next...
thing, the next pill, the next
treatment, the next remission,
hoping that this time...
And, uh... where did Alicia fit in,
except for what she could give to your son ?
You have no idea what it's like.
I saw her medical records.
I looked at her X rays.
I know what that little girl
suffered, what you put her through.
So you would let your
child die and do nothing.
Never.
No, you'd talk to doctors and research.
And then you'd find out that the National
Bone Marrow Registry can't help you
'cause your son is mixed race.
And even if he wasn't,
there aren't enough donors.
Out of four million, only 205,000 are Latino.
- I did what I had to do.
- You put one child over another.
I don't expect you to
understand. You don't have kids.
Uh, I have a daughter.
So, what kind of mother are you ?
When do you see her ? You work nights.
You probably don't even know
where she is half the time.
Alicia's life may not have been
simple, but at least I knew her.
Can you say the same ?
- Where's Greg ?
- Helping, uh... Sara.
I need the tox results for Alicia Perez.
The reports are still pending, but
the blood on the mother's T-shirt
matches the blood on the blanket.
- Belongs to the victim.
- Menstrual ?
Negative.
Well, the volume of blood
that was found on the blanket
suggests injury or some kind of trauma.
Nevertheless... I was very thorough.
Run it again, please.
Greg, you said you wanted to help out.
Well, yeah, with searching April's
apartment, maybe finding the bad guy.
This counts as field work, you know ?
Oh, I'm smiling on the inside.
Dirty laundry or garbage. You know what ?
- You take the garbage.
- Thanks.
- April own a computer ?
- No. Why ?
Well, she MapQuest the directions
to the convenience store
from the pedophile's address.
I already told you, Mom, I heard you.
Can we go now ?
No. You need to see for yourself
why you can't ever hitchhike
or go downtown or be
careless with your safety.
- Are you ready ?
- Just do it. I'm not scared.
She was waiting for a bus
downtown when she was attacked.
She's was 23.
She was taller and
stronger than you, Lindsey.
She fought back and didn't win.
Someone's gonna have to tell her family.
Her parents are gonna
have to see her like this.
Do you get it now ?
Kids don't belong in the coroner's
office unless they're in a drawer.
You should've found a different way
to deal with your daughter's rebellion.
Well, with due respect, Doc,
this doesn't concern you.
Ever notice how childhood keeps
getting shorter and shorter ?
- Whose fault is that ?
- I honestly don't know !
We subpoenaed Map Quest, they store
each pageon a different server.
All queries are saved for 72
hours, then they dump the core.
The suspect doesn't have a computer,
but she could've gone to the
library or used a service.
No, physical location doesn't matter.
What we do is a reversal process.
Using the Internet protocol
number, we can get to the server.
Which will ultimately lead to
the Internet account holder.
Right. We hunt for child
pornographers the same way.
Who does the account belong to ?
Sybil Perez.
- Mr. and Mrs. Perez...
- What's going on ?
I'll tell you on the way to the
police station, where's your son ?
- At church. Why ?
- Let's go.
Daniel Perez is taking Oxycodone for pain,
and Alicia was on Diazepam.
Diazepam ? That's a pretty hard-core
antidepressant for a kid that small.
I guess they didn't want her complaining while
they were mining her body for healthy cells.
- You think they didn't care about her ?
- I don't know.
Well, it must've been hard,
trying to keep their son alive,
- keep the family together.
- Couldn't have easy.
It wasn't for Alicia.
- Did you find anything ?
- Yeah. Blue fibers.
I take it you qualified at the range.
- You take it right.
- What'd you shoot ?
260 out of 300.
225's passing, which, I
believe, was your high score.
- Where are you doing ?
- Well, this is Dad's car.
You ever see those guys out in the street,
with the scope, measuring distances ?
Always thought they were nuts for
standing out in traffic, but...
Look familiar ?
Looks like the lividity
marks on Alicia's body.
I don't get you, man.
I mean, even if you could explain it,
I would never understand how you could
stuff your daughter in the trunk of your car
- and dump her body in the woods !
- I had to protect my family.
Wasn't Alicia part of your family ?
You're her father, you dumb bastard !
You're supposed to protect her.
- What kind of man are you ?
- Guilty.
You know, we got enough evidence to
charge you with premeditated murder.
You don't have any proof
I killed my daughter.
You helped your husband move the body.
You know, I really don't see
him taking her underpants off,
so that job was left to you.
Then you or your daughter, April,
checked the sex offenders' registry,
and you tried to frame an innocent man.
Innocent ?
You trying to make me believe you really
give a damn about a pedophile ? Please.
Forget about that ; this is about you.
You're the tough one. You run
the house. You run the family.
- People do what you say in a crisis.
- So ?
So this time Alicia said no.
She wanted to keep her kidney,
and that pissed you off.
- So you killed her.
- That's ridiculous.
She was angry, she wanted to play on
the soccer team, she wanted a life.
Alicia got angry, sometimes. Just sick of it.
We all did.
But she'd have been devastated if Daniel
had died and she did nothing to prevent it.
She loved her brother.
And you're just the type of woman
that would never let her forget it.
Come on, Alicia wanted out of this game,
and you couldn't let that happen.
Not to Daniel, not to your
only son, your favorite child.
You slipped Alicia some
of Daniel's Oxycodone.
Alicia ? Time for your pills.
But you gave her too much.
So now you got a problem, you had a dead body
in the house and no plausible explanation.
What are you gonna do ?
So you call your daughter April.
You make up a story, you play
your roles, and put on a show.
Wait. We have to do this right.
Oh, you know, I-I thought the,
uh, the slap was a nice touch.
I have a confirmation.
Those blue fibers are consistent with
the blanket that the girl was wrapped in.
And the shoe prints that I found at the scene
they're a match to the father's work boots.
I retested the T-shirt and the blanket.
The blood still matches Alicia Perez.
The evidence supports this unless
you'd like to second-guess that also.
I just expect things to
be done correctly, Greg.
We all have to learn how to accept change.
Mia's doing a great job.
It would be nice if someone
other than me said so.
You're right. What about the handkerchief ?
I compared that to the other blood evidence.
It's also match to the victim.
I didn't realize until... today...
....how lucky I am.
I know pretty much... how
and when I'm gonna die.
Most people don't.
It's what they're afraid of.
Was your sister afraid ?
Never.
I'm 11 years older than
her, and she took care of me.
She was my best friend, and I miss her.
As much pain as... I caused
her... and she... she wouldn't
and she wouldn't give up, let me, either.
That's why...
during the last relapse,
I made my parents swear that
it was the very last time.
But then your kidneys failed,
and they broke their word, huh ?
They told me they... swore not to
fight the cancer, so this didn't count.
I wasn't gonna lose this fight.
Oh, my God ! Please...
- We have to call the police.
- They'll put him in prison.
I couldn't watch her suffer anymore.
This wasn't a mercy killing, Daniel.
This was an execution.
Bone marrow, transfusions...
That's her blood in your veins.
It dripped out of your nose onto the
blanket while you were killing her.
If you cared so much for Alicia,
why didn't you take your
own life instead of hers ?
Suicide isn't an option.
It's an unforgiv sin in the eyes of God.
But you believe your God forgives murder ?
If that's your defense, it
won't keep you out of jail.
But my death will.
See, I've got about six more months.
I'll be dead before there's even a trial.
I-I do want to thank you, though.
- For what ?
- For speaking for Alicia.
You're probably the first person
in her life to think only of her.
You know, you may not believe
in God, sir, but you do His work.
