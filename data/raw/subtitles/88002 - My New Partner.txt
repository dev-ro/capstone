ROTTEN COPS
We could also postpone it
to next week.
Anyway, he'll be here
sooner or later.
I don't know what I ate,
but my stomach hurts.
He's not showing up anymore.
Normally, he comes at 2.
Tomorrow, second race: Narima.
It's her race.
But it's not certain.
-What do you know about horses?
It'll pay 20:1, at least.
Shit, that's him.
Ok, buddy.
Go get your profits.
Should be at least
ten thousand.
Ten thousand at 20:1...
We'll make him cry.
We'll wait near his house.
Come on, drive, Pierrot.
That's his garage.
Don't move.
Give us the money.
The cops!
Police. Take it easy.
-Calm down. Police.
What happened?
-They attacked me.
Who?
-I don't know.
D2, PS18.
Mugging in the Rue Gabrielle.
Twee suspects are running
in the direction of La Butte.
Shit, Pierrot. That way.
Go, hurry.
They can't catch the both of us.
One of us can escape.
Let me arrest you.
Why me?
-Because it was my idea.
Inspector Boisrond.
I've got this one here.
The other one went this way.
Follow me.
Inspector Boisrond. This way.
He disappeared into that park.
Search it all.
Ok. Go.
Do you know who you arrested?
-I don't see much in the dark.
Shit! Pierrot?
Tell me it's not true.
Not you.
Of course, this has to
happen to me.
I can't understand why a
guy like him would do that.
As if I didn't have enough
of a headache.
Maybe I shouldn't have arrested him.
-I would have done the same.
I don't want to justify
what he did, but...
...the guy he was after
is a well known pimp...
A business man,
innocent until proven guilty.
He was only taking his profits home.
-His whores' profits, you mean.
Does that give Pierrot the right to attack him?
-No, but it was still a pimp.
Would Pierrot have given
the money back to the girls...
...if he had succeeded?
-No, I wouldn't go that far.
So he would have become
a pimp. Bravo!
Listen, René, sometimes we have
a 'Pierrot' in the police force.
But luckily, they're mostly
people like you.
They're good. No fakes.
The best glasses.
Straight from Las Vegas to Barbès.
Please sit down.
Try your luck.
It's very easy, gentlemen.
Your bets, please, gentlemen.
4. The gentleman won.
-It was 6.
Shut up, he's a cop!
1, 2...
3,4...
-Beautiful, madam.
Your bets, please.
Thank you.
You look wonderful. Beautiful.
No fakes.
Straight from Las Vegas to Barbès.
Thank you, sir. That's
200, 300 and 400 on top of your 500 francs.
Thank you.
Hello, Marcel.
-Hello.
Give me a nice leg of lamb.
That one.
One beautiful leg of lamb.
Put it on my bill, madam.
-Yes, as usual.
Police, open up.
Isn't Pierrot with you?
-No, he got held up.
Isn't that a bit much for two?
Boss, Abdel owes me 5000
since 2 weeks.
From poker?
-Yes. I'm broke.
And he doesn't want to pay.
Everything alright, Abdel?
I swear. I was just about...
Give it to me.
And please.
For travel expenses.
Please wrap it up as a gift.
Thank you. Thank you all.
You cut it.
You shouldn't have.
-It's only a small thing.
Don't push.
You'll all get some.
You shouldn't have done that.
-It's my pleasure, boss.
I also have a gift for you,
my dear Boisrond.
They sent us a young inspector from Epinal
to replace Pierrot.
I'm counting on you
to show him the ropes.
Sign here, please.
That's the 6th time in 4 months
that they stole my handbag.
And you do nothing.
I don't put anything in it anymore, but...
-I understand.
Sign, please. Thank you.
Hello, René.
Excuse me. Please.
This is inspector François Lesbuche.
I'm handing him over to you.
Put down your suitcase.
It won't be stolen.
Hello, I'm from Epinal.
-Yes, I know. I know.
Have you got a place to stay?
-No, I'm still looking.
Across the road, there's the
Louxor hotel. Practical and affordable.
Hello, do you have a room?
-No, we're booked out.
I see.
Can I make a phone call?
Is it local?
-Yes.
Go ahead.
-Thanks.
What, 'booked out'?
-I can go somewhere else.
Stay where you are.
I'm coming over.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Why are you still here?
We're booked out.
I'm waiting for a friend.
-Get lost.
So you're booked out?
Yes, chief.
Inspector.
We'll check that.
Let's start.
Let's go.
It's true.
-I'll find a room somewhere else.
Police. Open up!
Police. Open up, please.
-Open up. Police.
Damn!
-My purse!
Quietly. Take it easy.
There you go.
Two whores, one illegal alien.
That's three empty rooms.
Excuse me. We didn't have
time to clean up.
No problem.
I could have found a room somewhere else.
That's what you think.
Everything could have been booked out.
I don't know Epinal, but
I guess it's not like Paris
No.
Hello.
Hello.
Do they all know you?
-I've been working here for 20 years.
I've taken them all in at least once.
You get to know them.
That's a nice little gang of pickpockets.
Three of them.
Nr 1 walks into the guy. Nr 2 takes
his wallet...
... and Nr 3 walks away with it.
Yes, I saw them steal the wallet.
-Well done, no?
Caught red-handed. Do we arrest them?
-No, you're here to learn.
To see how they operate.
There's plenty of time
to take them in.
One thing can't wait, though:
food.
Hello, everybody.
-Hello, René.
Hello, old man.
-Hello, René.
Thanks. Would you like an aperitif?
-No thanks. I don't drink.
I see.
I know it's not polite
to read at the table.
Yes, of course.
-Alright.
Are you reading the penal code?
-I have the exam in 2 years.
Do you want to become a chief?
-Yes, of course.
You don't like the street?
You prefer the office?
A bet for 200 francs.
Do you want to be in for 50%?
No, thanks.
You don't like horses either?
No, I don't like to gamble.
This is going to be fun.
Hello.
-Hi.
Hello.
-Hello.
Is the problem solved?
-Put everything on number 12.
Not on 17? You'll regret it.
-We'll see.
It's written in the stars.
-Place this bet for me.
Don't start crying afterwards.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me.
Do you often have lunch here, sir?
Sir? Just call me by my first name.
-Oh no.
I respect the hierarchy.
I couldn't do that.
Are you married?
No, not until I'm a
police chief.
Any earlier would be...
I think we're going
to have fun together.
I didn't join the police force
to have fun.
I already had that impression.
The bill, please.
-You want to pay?
Never mind. This is the cheapest
café of Paris.
I'm sorry, but I'm paying.
The bill, please.
- Individually, please.
Right away.
Here's your change.
Bye, all.
I may be from the province,
but I'm not an idiot.
Why do you say that?
I saw that they gave you back
100 francs too much.
What? They gave me back 400 from 500.
What are you on about?
I'm warning you.
I'm not like that.
Me neither, chief of police.
Robbery in the Rue du Delta.
Suspect fleeing towards Barbès.
Oh, shit.
Come on. We're listening to RTL
and the thief is getting away.
The horses are running as well.
Go. Run, Jolie Bégonie.
Run. Come on. Go!
Juniau. Juniau attacks.
Jolie Bégonie holds her own. No!
Shit.
I should have placed a different bet.
I'm such an idiot.
The thief was arrested
at Boulevard Barbès.
See? Why get all worked up?
My horse didn't win
and the thief was arrested anyway.
A burglar at 12 Rue Myrrha.
That's around the corner. Let's go there.
TV122 goes after the burglary.
-Got it.
Not so fast. Let's get him here.
Police, don't move!
-Don't shoot!
Get the handcuffs from the car.
-Didn't you bring them?
They ruin my pockets. Go!
Didn't I tell you to disappear?
Next time, I'll take you in. Get lost.
No, upstairs.
Where is he?
-I let him go.
He blew the whistle on a pimp.
-But we caught him red-handed.
There are many little fish like him.
If we want to catch big fish, we need
information from little guys like him.
So, if I understand it correctly:
We let one go because
he gives us information.
Using this information we
catch the next one.
He gives us a lead on the third one, etc, etc.
So we collect lots of information,
but we arrest nobody.
Prisons are all full anyway.
How's the new guy doing?
-He's an idiot.
The only medal he'll win is
for incorruptibility.
You've only worked with him for a week.
-I can't stand him.
What can I say?
I can't stand him.
I don't trust him.
And what do you do in the evenings?
-I study for the exam.
Of course. You want to
be a police chief.
You have to work if
you want to get ahead.
Oh yes, you get nothing for nothing.
-No.
René!
I've been looking for you all morning.
-What's wrong?
Race 4. 20:1 for number 417.
-Is that written in the stars?
Listen to me.
This one is certain.
We've got less than 5 minutes.
417. Hurry up.
-We're off.
Make way.
500 Francs on a win by 417.
A win for 17! 17!
-We're closed. Closed.
We've started. Macha Dumérilist in the lead.
-Go.
Mac Donald, Mic Mac, Mauviette
are following.
Come on.
-Naramba's getting closer.
The final has begun.
Macha Duméril leads, followed by Nonmaton.
Naramba's keeping up.
Mon Sommeil's also able to follow.
We're approaching the last bend.
Macha Duméril under attack by
number 17, Naramba.
17 challenges 13. What a match.
And the last straight end...
Number 17 takes first place,
closely followed by number 13...
...and number 11.
Thank you, madam.
Didn't I tell you
not to come here?
I'm just here for today.
-I see.
You're lucky that I won.
-I won as well.
See that? A police chief's
salary, earned in a couple of minutes.
Car 26, your position, please.
Car 26, I'm listening.
Where were you?
-The new guy felt sick.
We went for some fresh air.
-Is he feeling better?
Yes, he'll be alright.
-Ok, go back to your sector then.
Understood.
-So I was sick?
Look at you.
You're all pale, almost green.
The fact that we're not working
is making me sick.
What's our job then?
-To make sure people are safe.
To arrest burglars. You know that.
-You want to arrest somebody?
Plenty of opportunities.
Look, that café's terrace is one
meter too long. Forbidden!
Article R38-7.
A naked woman on that poster:
forbidden, article G92.
That granny, she's jaywalking:
forbidden!
That drag queen:
only allowed during the carnival.
That dog can't do that there. After it!
What are those two guys
smoking? Forbidden!
That shop doesn't have its
prices listed. Arrest them all!
Car 26 to Central.
Emergency! We need 6 cars.
The new guy arrested 250 people!
He's honking his horn.
Forbidden. Arrest him.
Murderer! Are you mad?
-It's nothing.
Don't touch it, murderer.
-Please calm down.
Let go of me.
-What's happening here?
Good that you're here.
-You weren't using the crossing.
And making a public scandal?
Do you carry ID?
And does the little mite have ID?
-But...
No? Alright then.
But next time, you'll be in trouble.
Keep walking. Keep walking.
We spend 10 hours a day together.
We have to get along.
-Yes.
We distinguish between theory and practice.
Theory's for at the academy.
And practice... I've been
collecting it for 20 years.
We got information that Camoun
is up to something.
Are you feeling any better?
At his age, you get over
things quickly.
The bill, please.
-No, never mind. It's on me.
Individual bills.
There's a pickpocket across the street.
So? Don't we do anything?
Go after him if you like.
I've got better things to do.
You can make a potato gratin with it.
Just turn it around.
After a while, add parsley.
The little machine cuts it up.
You don't just eat potatoes.
You can also cut up gherkins.
The thinner the
gherkin slices, the better.
Use this one to make Vichy carrots...
Police!
These are my recommendations
for tonight's races in Vincennes.
I've got him.
Sit there.
Bag, ID.
Alright.
Where did you find this bag?
In the basket of a lady.
-Please shut up.
Let him answer.
Did you find this bag in the street?
Yes.
And you picked it up?
-Yes.
That's when you saw this gentleman.
And you asked him where the nearest
police station was.
Yes.
-Yes.
And what a coincidence.
You found a friendly police man
who accompanied you all the way here.
Yes.
Not many people return
found objects anymore.
If this bag won't be claimed
for a whole year...
...it will be yours.
Sign here.
That's it.
This is your copy and your
ID card. All done.
Can I go?
-Of course.
I think you owe me an explanation.
"Confidential memo, nr B742:
We have already made 3,246 arrests.
That is an increase of 11%,
compared to last year.
Since we don't want
to be labelled...
...the most dangerous arrondissement
in Paris...
...we are friendly requested to postpone
arrests for petty crime until next year.
So, not only...
...did you risk getting a knife
in your belly...
...but you were also pushing us up
in the crime charts.
Unbelievable.
-Ah, yes.
You don't learn everything at
the academy. That would be too easy.
Are you a fast gunman?
At the academy, I was the fastest.
-Let's see then. Stand there.
Are you ready?
On the count of three.
1,2,3.
And you were the fastest.
Do you want to know why you
needed a bit more time than me?
Because I put lead in here.
If you don't want any lead here,
you put it here.
You hide here.
You'll be able to see everything.
Careful. Camoun is a dangerous guy.
We don't want to arrest him.
We want to know where he lives.
So we can tap his phone.
I'll hide behind that bin.
-No, get in it.
Warn me when he arrives.
I'm going into the house.
Hello, François. Everything alright?
-It doesn't exactly smell like roses.
That's nothing.
I should tell you where I once ended up.
There's a car coming.
-Ok.
It's Camoun.
Don't talk to me anymore.
Pick me up around 8.
-Alright.
Don't forget.
With Ramirez, it's a big deal.
The only problem is...
I don't trust him.
-If it's such a big deal...
It's just a garbage truck.
-Alright.
Don't stay here on your own then.
Nobody knows I'm here.
-You don't know anybody here.
You know I'm always
carrying something.
You're always armed.
Pick me up tomorrow morning and...
I'm being taken away.
-What?
What are you saying?
What an idiot.
It can't be true.
Idiot.
See you then, boss.
-See you.
Hello?
François, can you hear me?
Stop!
Stop, police!
My colleague is in there.
Listen. There's a police man in there.
Turn off that noise.
François, can you hear me?
-I've had enough of this.
How do we get him out?
-At the rubbish dump.
Unload here.
-Excuse me?
It's an order.
François, it's not my fault.
You asshole.
And this time I'll report you.
Hello, François.
I told you I couldn't help it.
Boisrond with a "d" at the end, right?
We found another Jesus.
Will you interrogate him?
-No, thanks.
I already made a donation.
But my colleague.
He's very unhappy at the moment.
It will relax him.
This is Jesus.
He's a specialist.
He likes to expose himself near schools.
Take his statement.
Chief?
-Yes.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
It's about the working hours.
Some colleagues have complained.
Name, first name, profession.
Name, first name, profession,
please.
I completely understand.
Yes...
-It's a problem.
What's he doing?
Have you gone mad?
Beating up a suspect?
I didn't touch him.
-This is going to cost you.
It's only natural
to lose it sometimes.
But he ran against all the walls.
You shouldn't leave any traces.
-He did it himself!
When you hit or kick,
it leaves marks.
This works really well.
Nobody will know.
I'll talk to the chief.
This is good reading.
A shame.
It wasn't easy...
...but I convinced the chief
not to report you.
Thank you, but I swear
I didn't do anything.
François, this is between
you and your conscience.
There you go.
-No longer on the house?
No, no, but it's been so long that...
Don't worry about it.
-I've never seen anybody like him.
I know men better then a shrink does.
Since I lay on the couch beside them.
They all have a weakness.
This one doesn't.
And he landed on me.
I don't like to see you like this.
-I tried everything, Simone.
If I give you advice, will you listen?
TV122, report in.
-This is TV122. I'm listening.
René, go see Natasha.
She's received death threats again.
We're on the way.
-What's it about?
A woman who says she's being
threatened by a man.
Isn't it true?
-She's a pathological liar.
I know her stories by heart.
I'll have a look around
and you tell the inspector everything.
Lesbuche, François Lesbuche.
-Maybe he'll enjoy the story.
Old idiot. He's not the one
who got raped.
Look here. This is
from a month ago.
Now, he's constantly calling.
Have a drink. I'll finish my bath.
Please do.
He almost got me, but luckily
somebody walked in on us.
Hello?
Oh no, it's him.
He wants to kill me today.
Hello? Hello?
He hung up.
I beg you. Protect me.
I'm afraid.
I'll get it.
She's lying, isn't she?
No, she's really being threatened.
-I beg you.
We'll be here tonight at 9.
-Not me.
Ok, I'll be there at 9.
Promise.
Thank you.
Good that not all cops are rotten.
Yes.
What does she mean by 'rotten'?
Don't you know that expression?
-No.
A rotten cop is a corrupt cop.
I see.
It means the same as 'on the take'.
On the take? Taking bribes.
You've got it.
There. It starts automatically
when the phone rings.
Does it record?
-Yes, yes.
Thanks.
-I'm not staying all night.
No, that would be inconvenient.
Do you have something to defend yourself?
-This gas paralyses the assailant.
Yes, have you had it for long?
-For 2 years.
2 years. The gas doesn't work anymore.
It keeps 6 months at most.
Really?
-Yes.
It burns.
Quick, get some water.
For gas that's over the date,
it works really well.
Yes, but it doesn't paralyse anymore.
Your eyes are all red.
Like an albino rabbit.
It burns, you know.
I'm so sorry.
You have to be pretty desperate
to attack somebody who uses this.
I'm not referring to you.
I'm so sorry.
Can't I make it up to you?
Yes, you could go out
for dinner with me tomorrow.
You're a big girl.
Go as far as you want.
Exactly, carte blanche.
Take care.
Who was that?
-Natasha.
Your stubborn new guy invited
her to dinner. It's working.
If you knew horses as well
as you know men...
...I'd make a killing tomorrow.
Well, I never slept with a horse.
Good evening.
-Good evening.
Where are we going?
You know Paris better than me.
You make a suggestion.
Have you got anything against Russians?
-No.
I know a nice Russian restaurant.
Chaluska!
No thanks, I don't drink.
-But you have to.
Or they'll sell you to a kulak.
-In that case.
Thanks.
It must be free here.
I see no prices.
Money has no value here.
Let me choose.
We'll have that, that and that.
And that and that.
And a bit of that.
Will you stick with champagne?
-With vodka.
With vodka. Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Enjoy.
Great. I love lump fish roe.
-It's caviar.
It looks like lump fish roe.
-Have you never had it?
Caviar? No.
-Let's drink to that.
I'll be right back.
Are you sure this is not a mistake?
Yes, you're right.
I forgot the vodka.
That's another 500 francs.
Do you accept cheques?
All done.
We have to give them something.
-Sorry?
We have to give them something.
-Of course.
Please.
-Thank you.
You too?
-And you too. Please.
The musicians as well.
-Yes, of course.
Please. Always useful.
And the owner gets my tie.
Here you go.
A present. Good evening.
-Thank you.
That Russian restaurant was great.
Alright. Take care.
She made him spend 5000 francs.
-Oh dear.
I hope he got some good value out of it.
-She says not.
5000 will create a
hole in his budget.
Poor guy.
One moment.
The profit's bigger than
expected, sir.
3200 francs
-That's a surprise.
Thanks, Yvonne.
Bring us a Bordeaux.
The good Château-Latour.
Yes, you've got one left.
Great. I wasn't expecting that.
-Me neither.
Thanks.
Is your little liar
still being threatened?
Well...
I connected her phone to a tape recorder.
Well done. Cheap and useful.
Individually?
-No, let me.
You didn't eat anything.
Dividing by 2 wouldn't be fair.
And this bottle
costs 600 francs.
Thanks.
-Listen, François.
If you drink wine only
once in your life, take this one.
Try it for me. Please.
My God.
Look at that.
Good, isn't it?
Yes.
Yes, exactly. Lorette in the third.
Hello. It's me.
The little liar's all yours.
How can you stand him?
-I have no choice.
I was waiting for your phone call.
-But your phone was bugged.
Exactly.
Ah, did he start again?
It was quiet for a few days,
but today he started again.
Does he want to come over tonight?
-Are you inviting me to dinner?
Is your colleague in.
-He's taking a statement.
But, François, couldn't you...
-Yes, yes.
I'm just taking a statement.
Come chief, I'll explain.
-Name, first name, profession, please.
He's working on something.
-I can see that.
No, it concerns the Camoun case.
With his looks, he's
able to make the girl talk.
Is your cold getting better?
-I think this is helping.
A mineral water, please.
Hello.
-Hello.
How are you?
-Just fine.
I've got a hot tip.
But you can never be sure.
-This tip is excellent.
Do you want to have a go?
5000.
-For 2000 you get partial protection.
Think about it.
Hello.
-Hello.
I want a horse for today.
Hello.
Kamasta will win the first race.
I need a loser.
-I only provide winners.
But I need a 100%
certified loser, understand?
Nimbus in race 4. A real loser.
-No chance?
No.
That's Nimbus. In the sun there.
Grey jacket with red sleeves.
Great gaits.
See how flexible the hind legs are?
I have to go.
There.
With five thousand, you can make ten.
Minus my 10%, of course.
Make that 15%.
-No, 10. Let's be fair.
The horses are at
the starting line.
The horses are in the starting-gates.
Niledo, Nana Dusigny, Dupont and Losaque
have the fastest start.
Nana and Niledo take over Newo Barbes...
...Niamban, Losaque and Nestor.
Angèle's losing terrain.
Nana Dusigny, Losaque, Niambon
and Nestor are ahead.
Losaque, Nestor and Niledo
are leading in the last bend...
...before Newo Barbes and Nimbus,
who's taking over on the inside.
Nestor's overtaken by Nimbus.
Man, look at that.
Go, Nestor!
-But we betted on Nimbus.
Quick! Faster!
-Run! Go!
We won! Won!
We have to wait for the photo.
-Which photo?
To see who really won.
Nimbus won.
-It's not sure.
No!
The result of race 4:
Nestor first and Nimbus second.
Shit, we lost!
You seem to be happy.
-No.
Not happy. But we have to
be able to handle losing.
François.
I'm completely broke.
-Life's not just about money.
I emptied my savings account.
Shit. Have a drink at my place.
Do you see that bar, 'The Trotter'?
If I ever win the jackpot,
I'll buy it.
It's a great location:
jockeys, trainers and owners meet there.
It's all about horses.
They only live for their horses.
A dream.
I didn't know you
read that much.
This was my wife's book shop.
I bought it in 1958.
Gélinotte co-financed it.
Did I never tell you about her?
-No.
Gélinotte was great. Her gaits!
She made me a millionaire
in three races.
You were lucky. Nimbus
made me poor in one race.
Don't you have parents
who can help you?
My father's dead and
my mother's a cleaning lady.
Well, that's that then.
When you get really low,
you think you'll never get up again.
Fifteen years ago,
my wife was killed by the disease.
Cancer, that is.
I thought I'd never recover.
But here I am. Standing.
I didn't know that.
There's a lot you don't know.
You don't even know
you still have 4500 francs.
Your 5 thousand francs,
minus my 500.
How's that possible?
At the last moment, I thought
the tip wasn't reliable.
So I didn't bet.
And what if Nimbus had won?
-I would have paid you myself.
I may not look it,
but I'm very honest.
I could also have kept it.
-Yes.
You just won 4500 francs.
I'd celebrate that.
Can I make a phone call?
-Of course.
This time I pick the restaurant.
When do we meet?
We won't meet again.
I was going to tell you yesterday,
but I didn't want to spoil the night.
What's wrong then?
I like you. You're handsome.
But it's all a setup.
Do you think we met by coincidence?
Well, yes.
-No.
Public violence at 9 AM?
You're an early starter.
No, I wanted to stop it.
The other guy insulted me.
What did he say?
-He called me an asshole.
What would you have done?
Asshole.
-François, don't be stupid.
François, don't lose it.
-Natasha told me, asshole.
I know everything.
I can explain.
-You fucked me over.
François, listen.
-She told me everything.
Bastard, bastard!
-François, stop.
Stop.
Jerk!
Stop! Stop!
Sit down.
Since you're a repeat offender,
you're going down for 3 months.
And what would you get for it?
-We can do it for free.
If I was a cop,
my life would be easier.
If everything was easy,
life would be boring.
Sign and get out.
Give me that.
Ok, out you go.
She's not right for you, François.
You need a girl from the province,
like yourself.
Buy a three bedroom place.
Have two children.
But Natasha is too much for you.
You can't afford her.
Will you be back in an hour?
Promise? I'll be expecting you.
Here you go.
-Isn't it on the house?
Why?
-I don't know, but René does.
Are you pissed off or something?
I would like to know why
this is the cheapest place in Paris.
Once a week they play cards
in the owner's cellar.
I turn a blind eye
and he doesn't charge me.
And occasionally he tells on somebody.
A fair deal, isn't it?
Do you have a lot of these deals?
-Are you with the police?
The thing is that I think
you're right about Natasha.
She's not from Epinal and a three
bedroom place wouldn't be her style.
Your suit isn't her style either.
Here.
Now you look like Belmondo.
Look at this guy.
Isn't it too...
-They'll be dropping like flies.
Like flies.
-How's Pierrot?
He's ill.
-When your health fails you...
Oh, his isn't failing.
And you, René?
-I don't need to impress anybody anymore.
Take this anyway.
That's nice.
For the police orphans.
And why is he so generous?
In the back of the shop,
20 Turks are working day and night.
And you turn a blind eye?
-They'd just go somewhere else.
And then somebody else
would be dressed for free.
You're not too stupid
for a guy from Epinal.
Is that all you have about Camoun?
-What do you do all day?
A bit of shopping?
-You stay out of it.
We're swamped with work.
It's not just Camoun.
Don't give me that shit.
Be nice and try a bit harder.
Alright. That's a promise, chief.
It's a real Cartier.
1000 francs.
I'm telling you it's real.
No, chief, I haven't got anything.
I hate being late for work.
You have a job now?
-No. I mean yes.
And I hate being late.
-One.
Two.
Three coats.
You won't be cold.
Better safe than sorry.
-Indeed.
Show me a watch.
You won't have a problem
with a watch like that.
Half a year's warranty.
-I'll keep it.
I'll have it checked.
See if it's real.
Take it.
-No.
Take it. You'll find
someone you can give it to.
I love presents.
-Good. I love giving them.
If somebody had told me
I'd fall in love with a cop...
Isn't life strange?
-Very.
You arrange a girl
for your new guy...
...and it turns out to be a big romance.
-Wonderful, isn't it?
I would have done the same thing.
He's handsome and young.
And I'm old and ugly.
-You? You don't know a thing about women.
I hardly understand horses even.
Look at that.
That's about 6000 worth.
-I know.
My couriers park anywhere.
People don't have any
work ethics anymore.
For 1500, I'll forget all about it.
But last time...
-Last time I was alone, but not anymore.
I see.
Thanks.
Let's go. See you next time.
Is that your idea of equality?
500 for you, 500 for me and 500 for
the person who forgets about the tickets.
François, look behind you.
The guy in red. He's a dealer.
A what?
-What do they teach you at the academy?
Let's get him.
You stay here.
Not in the bin.
-No.
I'll go to the street. He knows me,
so he'll walk straight into your arms.
And what do I do?
Take his money?
Arrest him and wait for me.
Police! Don't move.
Handcuff him.
Not there. Give it to me.
If you walk around with him like this,
his buddies will help him escape.
There.
Nicely tight and the other one...
...in the sock. That's it.
You go ahead.
-Won't he run off?
Have you ever tried
to run with that thing?
Keep going.
Left.
You have no right.
You'll get it back in 2 years.
When you come out.
It will have lost half of its value,
but you'll get it back.
We arrived home.
I'll give you five thousand
if you let me go.
Give it up.
-I don't have it on me.
You have three days
to give me the money.
Get lost.
-Thanks.
I'm completely broke.
Can't you lend me 100 francs?
Now you owe me 5100.
Do you think we'll see him again.
-Certainly not.
But at least he won't hang around.
And... the stuff?
The stuff?
-The powder.
I have an idea.
Any news about Camoun?
-No, nothing special.
Upstairs they want some results.
Have you got it too now?
Here, this clears the nose.
This doesn't only clear it.
It cures it as well.
What's it called?
-I've got another one.
Please, let me know if it helped.
Thanks, dear René. Thanks.
You have to be a bit careful
with Natasha.
Cops have been charged
with pimping before.
But she's not a whore.
She knows how to get around.
You know the law.
Better than me.
-Yes.
Don't. Excuse me.
-Yes?
You are the owner?
-Yes.
When did you open?
-Two weeks ago.
Ah, two weeks.
It's very good.
-Yes, very good.
-Very good.
That's rare in this suburb.
-Thank you.
We wouldn't want you to close down.
-No.
Why?
-Have a seat.
You know all the paperwork.
All the complicated rules.
The law...
-Everything is according to the book.
Let's start at the beginning.
Do you see that door?
It opens in the wrong direction.
We can change that.
-That will be expensive.
Carpenters are expensive.
The other day, I had some book
shelves built. I paid a fortune.
And that's a cheap thing to have done.
A door like this would cost...
-That door would cost you...
At least.
Can I offer you a little cigar?
Why a small one?
See? Giving advice
is also part of our job.
You make friends that way.
Everybody's happy, no?
-Yes.
Tell me. Could you do me a favour?
Can I borrow your car for the evening?
Next time, give me a bit more notice.
I wasn't really free this evening.
From now on, you have something
planned for every evening.
If he knew I spent the
evening with a cop.
Franck! No! No!
What's happening?
Stop it, Franck!
-Shut up!
Stop it!
Is that him?
That's her pimp.
Those are the rules.
Don't do anything stupid.
François, where are you going?
Boisrond, the chief wants to see you.
You won't be observing Camoun anymore.
-Why? Did we do something wrong?
No, it's temporary.
Your product is great, by the way.
It gives you real energy.
Don't take too much of it, though.
I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Explain this to me. Shit.
Asshole.
You're completely crazy.
Do you think he'll get life?
Even if one of his girls
testifies against him...
...he'll be out in less than a year.
And then what will he do?
I know him. He'll put
a bullet between your eyes.
Bring him to my office.
I'll take his statement.
This is abuse of power.
-Empty your pockets.
I knew you were a pimp.
I didn't know you dealt heroin.
You just put it there.
-Look, another one.
That's not for personal use.
But that's not mine. You...
Last week they found...
...a guy with 50 plastic bags in his stomach.
And 10 grams of heroin in each bag.
Do you know what he said?
"That's not mine."
So, listen.
What do you want from me?
I like love stories with a happy end.
So you keep the other girls.
And you let Natasha go.
That way you leave a free man.
I swear, you have to get to know him.
He's a rotten cop.
-His heart's in the right place.
He solved the problem with Franck.
He won't bother us anymore.
Yes, we're lucky because I know him.
It could have ended very badly.
Try your luck. Anyone can win.
Your bets, please.
-Five wins.
You look wonderful.
-Your bet.
Place your bets.
5! I won!
-I bet on the 5.
My friend bet on the 5.
Shut up. He's a cop!
Alright, I had the 6.
-Exactly.
300, 400 and 500.
Pay attention. I bet 200.
-It was a 100.
What? You bet a 100.
-No, 200.
It was 200.
He bet 150.
-Alright.
100 and 150 francs.
Step up.
Come on. Try your luck.
What were you doing?
It took me 20 years to
establish my prices.
You don't make much,
but you make a little bit often.
I don't want any inflation.
Not bad, is it?
Thanks.
200, 300, 400 back from 500.
Thank you.
No, you're wrong.
I gave you 100 francs.
Are you sure?
-I know what I gave you.
What's he going to think?
-We've got beef and carrots after us.
The DCI: Department of
Criminal Investigation.
The police's police.
-Shit.
Why 'beef carrots'?
-When they get you, they let you stew.
We have to be very careful
now, François.
René, I have a tip for the
fourth race.
I have a tip for the first race.
There are two other cops at the bar.
I can never get you to place a bet.
What a shame.
Hey, François.
I have a BMW. Used.
White. A 100 thousand.
Go away.
-Get lost.
Now go.
Excuse me.
-Yes.
The bill, please.
-But, René.
Please hurry. We're busy.
I'm going to ask Bloret
for an explanation.
Oh, what would that asshole know.
You can't see Natasha for a while.
I smelled them.
Are you slowly getting paranoid?
They're really following us.
-Who says they're police?
I can smell them.
It has happened to all of us.
But you have nothing to fear.
You're an honest cop.
Absolutely.
Are you feeling any better?
-I bought your product.
It's not working at all anymore.
-You bought the standard powder.
You need the other one. It's hard
to find. I'll buy you some.
-Did nobody follow you?
-No, I did as you said.
What's wrong then?
-Two DCI cops are following us.
The police's police.
That's great.
Do you think so?
-It's fantastic.
I feel as if I'm with a
big criminal on the run.
Do you need money or a place to hide?
-It's not as bad as that.
So we can spend the night together?
Not right now.
-What shall we do then?
It's pretty quiet here.
Don't you want anything today?
-I'm a vegetarian now.
They're still following us.
-They're like haemorrhoids.
Machine Gun Dédé.
Tonight, we'll take them to
Machine Gun Dédé's hide-out.
You never know.
Dédé, police.
We know you're there.
Fucking cops! I'll kill you!
Man, this Dédé.
He hasn't gotten any older.
Shoot me.
Here in my belly fat.
I won't feel a thing.
-Are you crazy?
It's the only way to get rid
of the haemorrhoids.
No, man!
-Show a bit of courage for once.
Do it.
-Sure?
From really close.
Careful with my hand. Go!
Does it hurt, René?
Yes, a bit.
Don't move. police!
So are we, idiots.
Well done. Really great.
We almost had him and
then you attack us from behind.
We were watching you.
-Yes, I know.
You'll soon be directing traffic.
I'm telling you.
You will pay dearly for this.
Are you ok, René? Does it hurt a lot?
-Yes, I think I'm dying.
I beg you. Kill me.
Can you make it to the car?
-No.
Help him, idiots.
-I can't do it.
We didn't know.
-Yeah, yeah.
I can already see the
headlines in the paper.
Can't we solve this somehow?
-How then?
We'll write a positive report.
-And that guy's the one who shot you.
And you'll get a medal.
-Listen, guys.
I'd only be doing it to
save my colleagues.
What do you think, François?
I agree with you. Between colleagues...
-Thanks, guys.
Inspector Boisrond, your courageous
behaviour in a dangerous situation...
...your commendable dedication...
Inspector Boisrond, as of today
you are Chief Inspector.
And it is my honour to award you
the National Order of Merit.
Thank you, Mr Prefect.
Not bad, is it?
You won't get a medal like this.
Nobody catches a bullet
sitting at their desk.
René, there's news.
Are you recovering well?
Come with me.
Oh, yes.
You come too.
I just can't find your product.
I'm starting to miss it.
Tomorrow, for sure.
-Things are developing with Camoun.
Guys, you have to keep
him under observation.
It's too cold to be outside all day.
I've hardly recovered.
This time, they've spent some money.
-You can use a submarine.
I see.
-What's that?
This is a submarine. See?
A furnished van.
You can stay here for hours.
It's heated.
There's even a toilet.
That's Camoun.
He gets out of the car.
He talks to the bald guy.
-Did you write down the time?
He stands on the pavement.
But...
Shit!
Those stupid kids are playing tennis.
I'll get them.
You stay here. You'd give us away.
Hey.
He's going inside.
The bald guy's leaving. Take my place.
I'm getting a headache.
Get lost!
What are they thinking?
A glass of red wine and
two aspirins, please.
Did Camoun come out?
-No, he's still inside.
But I just saw him.
I was here all the time.
I would have seen him.
So there's an exit on the Rue du Nord.
He must have arranged that.
I'm going to the land register.
See you later.
Should I write this down?
-No, let me check it first.
Two streets and two houses
that are connected.
Is there a passage?
-Criminals always know where the emergency exit is.
The chief will like this.
We have news about Camoun.
-Me too. Drop the case.
The organised crime squad's
after Camoun. He's their big trophy.
The special forces. They're cowboys.
They think we're retarded.
Come in, gentlemen.
I'm almost out again.
I'll get you more tomorrow.
-Tomorrow's a big day.
More than 5 million worth
of drugs for Camoun.
Yes, well that's...
-Vidal.
Nice to meet you. Chief Bloret.
The door... damn!
Guys, let me introduce:
Spencer and Fisher from Narcotics.
They arrived from the USA.
Tomorrow night, the drugs
will be exchanged for the money.
Tonight, we'll take our positions
on the roof. Armed.
Six groups of two,
as follows:
Here, here, there, there,
here and there.
When you receive the order,
you attack.
If they notice anything,
they might burn the whole lot.
We've seen that in Miami.
And where will we be?
You?
Well, in the bar. As always.
20 men in a truck and...
-He was joking.
Can I say something
about your plan?
Listen, we have no need for pensioners.
Who does he think he is,
that asshole?
I have to tell you something.
-What?
Not here.
Well?
Tomorrow, there will be
a million dollars at Camoun's place.
Yes, so?
What do you think happens
when the cowboys attack?
Camoun will run through the back exit.
And we'll be there to get
him and his money.
You're completely crazy.
A million dollars. No more small fry.
No, no.
-You could buy your bistro.
No, I don't want it.
-But you want horses.
It's too big for me, François.
-René.
Vidal's right.
You should really retire.
Don't change then.
Continue with your little tricks.
Why are you pulling that face?
François has lost it.
He wants to do this thing with me.
The student's teaching the master.
-It's a matter of millions.
That's a lot.
Are you expecting anyone?
-No.
I'll hide in the kitchen.
Who is it?
-Police, open up.
I want to talk to René.
-He's not here.
I said he's not here.
I said no, François.
No means no.
I'm telling you to say yes.
-Why?
Or else I'll tell the cops
about your little deals.
And with whom you live. A...
-Say it. With a whore.
Spoken too quickly.
I'm her only and last customer.
Cops have been charged
with pimping before.
Alright.
Are we in it together?
Do I have a choice?
-No.
You'll see.
You'll be grateful.
My stomach hurts.
I must have eaten something wrong.
Clearly. Look after yourself.
You have to be fit tomorrow.
How would you like
to have your own business?
A little bistro and bookie's office.
In a good location.
You're right. I have to start
selling something other than myself.
Because when it comes to that,
I'm just about broke.
Your mind isn't with it.
-Things will be better tomorrow.
Bloret gave me the code.
-Which code?
Every criminal listens to
the police radio.
When the stuff arrives: "Biker
demonstration at Porte de la Chapelle".
And for the assault:
"Break up the demonstration".
Nothing.
To all cars.
Biker demonstration at Porte de la Chapelle.
To all cars: Biker
demonstration at Porte de la Chapelle
Did you hear that?
Let's avoid Porte de la Chapelle.
Could be a traffic jam.
I repeat to all units:
Biker demonstration at Porte de la Chapelle
Let's go.
My stomach starts to hurt again.
-I've got exactly what you need.
Just have a bit of powder.
-No, I never did that before.
Come on. You'll see.
Here.
Here.
Are you sure that...
This will help.
-Are you sure?
Shit, this starts off well.
-Let's go.
What are you waiting for?
They're checking whether the money's real.
And whether the stuff's good.
And when they'll be relaxed,
we go in.
Break up the demonstration.
Perfect. The money's good.
Ok, Marcel, pop the corks.
The cops.
Shit, the cops.
Don't shoot. We're not shooting.
Don't shoot. You're surrounded.
You, over there.
Make sure nobody escapes.
Go, quickly. Hurry, hurry!
I've got one.
Don't move.
Quick, drive.
They're leaving with the money.
Shit, they're following us.
-Go.
This will alert the cops.
-I'd rather deal with them.
A colleague in trouble.
They're driving towards Porte de Pantin.
They're cops. Go, faster.
We can't both be arrested.
Do you want to arrest me?
-Are you crazy? Drive to the canal.
François.
-Down towards the canal.
We'll see each other later.
Ok?
-Yes.
Go.
-I'll call the cops.
They'll come anyway. Visit me in jail.
Or at the graveyard.
Come, Simone.
Go home, Simone.
But René.
-Hurry, you hear?
It's been a long time
since I told you I love you.
You never told me that.
When will we see each other again?
-During the trial.
René Boisrond, you just heard
the prosecutor.
Do you confess?
Yes, I do.
But I was going to return the money.
The money that was burnt in the fire.
-Well, it was made of paper.
You still maintain you had no accomplice?
No accomplice at all, your Honour.
René Boisrond...
...the court has taken your excellent
service record into account.
You are sentenced to
two years in prison.
Oh, shit!
I'll miss him.
I found you a very good cell.
Facing south, overlooking the football field.
-Thanks.
You know your cell mate well.
Hopefully not somebody I arrested.
Yes.
Oh, René.
What a nice surprise.
Pierrot!
I'm so happy to see you, you know.
My Pierrot.
How much did you get?
-Two years.
That sucks.
I'll be out in two weeks.
You could stay longer.
200 on Fanny winning.
Fanny Two? She's old.
Not a chance.
Charming Mouse.
I told you, she needs a race on soft soil.
The soil will be rock hard.
No, for me, there's only one.
Only one: Mon Doudou.
No, she sucks.
-Not at all.
Eugène, are you leaving tomorrow?
Put it all on Mon Doudou.
And don't try anything.
You've been had.
You think?
-What?
You've been here for six months.
He didn't write one letter.
No news, not one package.
He left the police force two
months ago. Disappeared.
And Natasha?
Also gone. We've been had.
Yes, young people. Never trust them.
René, you're leaving tomorrow,
aren't you?
Can you put 100 francs
on a horse?
Do you know a horse
called Rotten One?
No, from which stable?
I don't know.
It's his first race.
Its chances are 100:1.
No, ask somebody else.
That's all over for me.
His name is Rotten One.
He's yours.
Get on. His race is this afternoon.
In Vincennes, the track opposite
the bar called 'The Trotter'.
Which, I think, is also yours.
