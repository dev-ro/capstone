It's not my fault
you make me think bad thoughts.
Oh, right.
You're so innocent.
I'm totally leading you
down a dark path of corruption.
DAMON: [LAUGHS] You're right.
If I crash and burn
on my test today,
that's on you.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot
you have your PSATs today.
Are you ready?
DAMON: How can I be ready

[NEWS REPORT
PLAYING INDISTINCTLY]
REPORTER: [ON TV] ...several
reports of police staying
near the Walmart
on Grounds Mountain
and also near Cornell Street.
Witnesses tell us
the driver calmly exited
the vehicle
just moments before the impact
that police say
killed the child instantly.
And reports that the woman
was in fact the child's mother
could not be verified.
Good Lord, really?
Before breakfast?
Oh, sorry, Ms. Ryan.
See that, Josh?
Always do what Mom says.
-[IMITATES TRUCK ENGINE]
-JOSH: No! No! No! No!
[IMITATES EXPLOSION]

-[STIFLING LAUGHTER]
Hey, uh, can I go to a movie
with Riley tonight?
-[MOCKING] "With Riley."
-CARLY: Shut up.
Since when does anyone
under 30 go to the movies?
Sweetheart,
you're not seeing that boy.
Well, he has a name,
and I know why you don't want me
to see him.
BRENT: Yeah,
because he's a junior,
and you're a sophomore.
Listen, I used to be
a 17-year-old dude once,
-so I think I know--
-Dad, gross!
-Gross?
-CARLY: Yeah.
Honey, your grandparents
are coming
-for dinner tonight, remember?
-Wh-- Mom, really?
-Really.
-[SIGHS]
What? You haven't seen them
in months,
and they're not getting
any younger, you know,
so the "movie" can wait.
Awesome!
You and Grandma
passive-aggressive
bitching at each other,
and Grandpa telling
his disgusting Vietnam stories.
"Pulled it out
and killed the Charlie bastard
-with his own pigsticker."
-[MOUTHING SILENTLY]
Carly! I am so sorry.

-BRENT: Son, you take my advice.
Don't ever have kids.
Oh, oops!
[SPEAKING CANTONESE]

-It's too late.
-This is bullshit!
Okay, Carly,
that is enough, young lady!
So nothing about Jeannie yet?
No. No baby news yet.
Soon, soon, soon.
This is so weak.
I can already see
how this is gonna go down.
Aunt Jeannie's gonna
have her kid today,
out of all days,
and you're going to be
the no-show for dinner.
I--
You know, I want to trust you,
Carly. Really...
I do.
Your dad and I both do,
but you don't make it easy
on us when you shut us out.
[CARLY SIGHS]
Do you mind not Facebooking
when we're driving together?
It's really
the only time we have,
just the two of us.
"Facebooking."
You know what I mean.
Yeah, whatever.
You know, I really, really hate
when you say that.
[CARLY EXHALES]
Amazing. I mean,
everything just revolves
around you, doesn't it?
Doesn't everyone's world
revolve around themselves?
Who else
should it revolve around?
Well,
you're part of a family, Carly,
and that means
that you love each other
even when
you can't stand each other,
and that you give a shit
even when you don't really give
a shit. [LAUGHS]
Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense, Mom.
Take your Aunt Jeannie,
for instance.
I mean, you could have
a new cousin today.
That is a big deal.
And all you can think about is--
[BABBLES]
[CHUCKLES] You know,
I don't even know
what you're thinking about,
because you don't tell me
anymore.
We used to be best friends,
remember?
Okay. Well, that's not the case
anymore, Mom.
I have other friends.
Right.
See, it's just, for me,
you and Josh are everything.
So you don't get
to just shut me out.
Okay, it's not fair.
God, it's not my fault
you have no life!

It's about being hot,

[LAUGHS] Speak for yourself.
I mean,
don't get me wrong.
Look at you.
You're amazing.
But that's not what
keeps your hubby
from chasing
after 17-year-olds.
It's state divorce law
that does that shit.
Yeah, if it weren't for that
juicy hunk of asada
in the front row,
I would not be keeping up
with this torture.
Okay, you know he could
sue you for sexual harassment
for shoving your business
in his face.
Are you kidding me?
He is making his way
through that class

I'm just hoping
he gets to my row
before I have a massive coronary
and peace out, yo.
[MOUTHING SILENTLY]
Your sister,
she's gonna pop one out, huh?
Yeah, good luck with that.
God, I need a real drink.
I saw Riley changing in front
of the mirror the other day,
and I started to hate her
a little.
She's my daughter.
I should be proud,
but all I could think was,
"One day,
those tits are gonna drop,
you little whore."
-Is that wrong?
-That's funny.
-I could have sworn--
-What?
That I got 100
from the ATM yesterday.
Oh, don't worry
about it. I got this.
Yeah.
No, it's just weird.
I don't know
what I could have done with it.
I don't know
about your little angels,
but mine steals from me
every chance she gets.
-No.
-She's a bitch.
Does anybody know
what this means?
Anyone? Bueller? No?
It refers to products designed
with a predetermined,
limited life span.
Products that are
literally built to die,
that is, to become unfashionable
or nonfunctional
in a certain amount of time.
-See exhibit A.
-Excuse me.
That's actually
the new one.
You are dexterously
missing my point,
and making it at exactly
the same time.
See, the idea is to manipulate
-the consumer...
-[STUDENTS LAUGHING]
...to constantly want to buy
-the new one.
-Yeah, duh.
Of course, there's
an argument to be made
in favor of--
What's this? What is it?
-Planned obsolescence.
-STUDENTS: Planned obsolescence.
That's right.
Without getting rid of the old,
you might never embrace the new.

ANCHOR: [ON TV]
What we had prayed...
Found it.
...was an isolated incident
is apparently far from it,
as multiple reports
are now coming in
of similar attacks
across the country.
We can hardly believe
what we are reporting to you
based on the videos
that are flooding in,
and we want to warn you,
this footage is very graphic.
[CHILD GAGGING]
Fucking needed that.
-Hey, you want a drink, bitch?
-Yeah.
I mean, fuck no!
Dude, get in here!
ANCHOR: [CONTINUES]
But what we know is this.
-What the fuck?
-Multiple incidents
are being reported
of parents attacking...
and, in many cases,
murdering their own children.
Riley!
RILEY: Mom?
Are you okay?
I spilled my drink.
DR. OZ: [ON TV] I'm sure
many viewers are unfamiliar
with a phenomenon
known as "savaging."
It's actually somewhat common
in the animal kingdom.
For instance,
in a domestic pig population,
as anyone involved in raising
livestock will tell you--
ANCHOR: Excuse me.
You are talking about pigs?
There are children dying,
and you're talking about pigs.
Well, yes. In fact,
around 50 percent
of the piglet fatalities seen
is due to the mother attacking
or crushing
the newborn pre-weaned babies,
and no one can say
exactly why they do it.
[RILEY GROANS]
ANCHOR: [ON TV] Again, we have
to emphasize, we have no idea
what set off the incidents,
and authorities
have so far refused
to issue any statement.
All we know is what we are...
Riley?
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING]

if you're messing with me,
I'll kill you.
-Hey, kiddo.
-[CARLY SCREAMS]
NURSE: [ON PA] Dr. Torres,
please dial...
ANCHOR: [ON TV] All right,
but isn't it a fact
that we still have no real idea
what is causing this?
MAN: [ON TV] It could be
a natural phenomenon,
but let's just postulate
someone wants to wipe us out,
so they create
a biological weapon
or a neurotoxin which attacks
a very hard-wired human impulse,
which is to protect our young.
Any parent would rush out
in front of a speeding car,
or an oncoming train
or even a wild animal
to save their child,
but if you could take
that natural human impulse
and reverse it,
you wouldn't have
to wipe us out,
because at that point,
we ourselves
would be wiping out
our own future.

She didn't do anything wrong.

You don't even like pool.
Can I ask how much this cost?
Don't worry about it.
I kind of have to worry

I mean,
Christmas is coming up.
Do you really think
this is the right time
to start building a man cave
in the basement?
It's not a man cave, Kendall.
Jesus!
I just thought, you know,
like-- like a family room.
The whole house
is a family room.
Okay. You see, I got a problem
with that one right there,
because I bust my ass six days
a week
trying to pay this place down,
and it's like
a fucking obstacle course
trying to get out
the fucking front door.
I mean, one of these days,
I'm gonna trip over
one of Josh's toys
and take a nose dive
-straight to the emergency room.
-What are you saying?
I'm saying that maybe we need
to have boundaries.
I'm saying that
maybe there needs to be
a fucking grown-up zone,
and a fucking kid zone!

I did. I had all that...
but there's this bigger thing.
All your life,
you know it's coming.
And there's this mix
of anxiety and...
secret excitement...
and terror...
because you know that one day...
inevitably...
you'll create this life.
The hugeness of it,
the importance of it...
everything is building

And then...
it happens.

it's not like that.

[BURPS] Well...
you fucked up, son...

I fucked up even worse?
-How?
-Did you know
that once upon a time,
the Firebird
was Grandpa Mel's car?
It's true.
He bought it brand-new in '79
right off the line,
used his V.A. settlement.
Man, that car was his baby.
When I was little,
I used to watch him
polish it on the front lawn
every weekend.
And by the time I turned
into a dumb,
horny, pimple-faced
high school kid
just like you're gonna be,
it was officially a classic.
So long story short,
I stole the keys,
picked up my girlfriend.
Yeah,
this is before I met your mom.
Took it out for a little spin.
-[TIRES SCREECHING]
-[TRUCK HORN HONKING]
Pretty much totaled
the motherfucker.
-Cool.
-[CHUCKLES]
Well, Mel didn't think so.
I thought
he was gonna crush my skull.
But you know what he did?
He sold it to me.
And it wasn't cheap either.
I'd have to pay him back
every dime he put into it.
And if I wanted
to drive my senior year,
I better learn how to fix a car.
So I did.
I spent the whole summer
working two jobs,
paid back my dad.
"Here's ten dollars, Dad.
Here's 20 dollars, Dad.
Here's 100 dollars, Dad."
By the end of the summer,
I had that bad boy cherried out
from the ground up.
Now, you talk
about a pussy magnet.
-Dad.
-Chick magnet. [CHUCKLES]
[SIGHS]
Your mom keeps telling me
to sell it,
but I just can't bear
to let her go.
Is that why Mom always says,
"I can't bear to think
about what must have happened
in that car"?
Because of the accident?
No, no, buddy. Nah.
She's talking
about something else.
[SIGHS]
I'm sorry I messed up, Dad.
Hey...
like father, like son, right?
But if you ever
touch that car again...
I'll fuckin' kill you.
