Had it sir.
Care for some betel leaves and nuts?
You're making fun of us.
l'm not making fun of you,
l'm telling the truth.
Eat, sleep and wake up.
That's how the life is going on.
Ask.
Any background to the incident?
lt's gang war between two gangs.
We are still unaware of the
reason for their shoot out.
So many have died,
you are replying carelessly.
Shall we close the schools
and hoist the flag half mast?
Answer like a responsible officer.
Good, l was waiting for you.
We are searching for an elusive criminal,
but you visit him in his den,
enjoy the feast he throws to you,
interview him,
you run cover story with his photo
and make him a hero.
Won't you inform police
about his whereabouts?
You will not do.
You're interfering with press freedom.
What is press freedom?
Do you know who are real journalists?
Rajaji, Periyar, Anna, Kalaignar,
they are also journalists,
you're holding the same pen
with which they worked.
But how do you write the news?
5 men gang rape a 10 year old girl!
You'll publish it with this headline
and colour photo to boot,
and spoil the little girl's life.
lf we arrest criminals,
you take his photos in the court,
and make him a VlP,
he too gives big smile and
leaves waving his hand.
lf we arrest a man in Tirunelveli,
an advocate descends from Delhi,
A Tamil bagging gold medal in
America doing research,
is just a bit news of your
newspaper's last page.
We know what news to cover
and how to cover a news.
Who is it?
Ka. Ma. Punniyakoti from Oli magazine.
ls it you?
lsn't you who wrote,
Lorry smashed, Driver crushed!
Relatives of the dead man are
crying in bereavement,
but you're worried about rhyme.
To keep you in home safely
with your wife and kids,
we are working at nights
leaving our wives and kids.
Violence is on raise. But you pillory us
saying is police sleeping?
Please repeat it again sir.
TV media? l'll repeat.
What do you do?
Without caring about the culture,
father-in-law rapes daughter-in-law,
watch after the break! You dramatize
and increase your TRP ratings.
People like it sir.
l'm telling to them also.
Every Policeman is
a citizen in uniform.
Every citizen is a
policeman without uniform.
Nobody is responsible in this society.
The only department that
is responsible is Police.
Sorry, l got little emotional.
Take down.
Law will do it's duty.
Hi!
Going home?
- Yeah.
What's that colour box?
Lunch box...Upma.
Got it?
- No, l had it.
l'll catch him red handed, and
hand over him to the lnspector.
lt'll be good if l get her cell number.
What is your cell number?

Asking me reason?
Get up bloody bitch!

This is too much.

She looked educated but...
Sister, you don't panic,
please be seated.
He isn't seen.
l'll lynch you, Kedisooda.
He's enjoying with two girls.
Where's my girl?
Hi!
Where is your sister?
She left to home long back?
Thank God! Atleast you made it.
Ask your sister to call me
on phone once.
Have you started talking on phone too?
Just now.
Okay...okay...l'll tell her.
You look handsome boy!
l've a doubt.
What if your sister too becomes
fat like you in future?
lt's all fat!
lt's beyond our control.
You're right.
What's in the lunch box?
Upma!
ls your entire family running on upma?
Pack this Bodisooda
and throw him out!
What do you think of yourselves?
l'm changing disguises
using all my talent.
But you're finding me very easily.
What's the use in changing disguises?
How are you able to find me?
Are you spying on me?
Why should we spy on you?
Your bun head is identifying
you, bloody fool!
Alas! l forgot about this!
Okay, push me out from the running train.
- ldiot, the train is stopped.
Stopped?
Go.
Go.
- l'm going.

Sir, l don't want anything.
Take it.
You can have fun with women.

Greetings buddy!
Are you laughing at me?
No...no...new Constable,

Useless guy.
He wants to win the President's medal.
You're a sharp shooter, aren't you?
Shoot him.
Aim him and fire.
Sir...sir.
- You don't get sacred.
Aim at Thamba.
He's a brave man, aim at him.
Sir.
- Fire at him.

Do you know he's a great land shark?
You shot him easily.
You'll not face the inquest.

What to do?
Sir, l'm lnspector Govind here,
Constable Mugilan and Thamba
shot each other to death,
Yes sir, send additional
forces immediately.
l did all this for you.
Two lives are lost.

No, l don't want money.
My second wife wants a pent house.
So give her the tenth floor.
Sir, its Rs. 15 millions.
That's all? Then give her two floors.
- Sir.
Feel happy to be alive still.
K. Padmavathi, register it on this name.

Are you the driver?

Why are you wasting water with leaking tank?

issue so cheaply?
This is unnecessary to you.

Oh God! lt's full open now!

He's more short tempered than me.
How did they gave him a lorry?
How did this happen?

My hands are not enough.

Everyone will get water,

Look at the wonder.

Connection changed.
No need of tanker lorry, bring him.
Why are you distributing water here
that is meant for my street?
lt isn't good.
There are people here and
they too need water.
Okay, first we'll take 5000 litres
and then you take 5000 litres.
Take me?
Get lost fools!
Stop man.
They are after me, the water isn't mine.
Stop, you pig. Don't run.
Super shoot!

But l like you very much.
Think again.
Master, get up.
Why is your Assistant crying?
What happened?
Volcanoes never cry.
So, l made him cry on behalf of me.
My love vanished in thin air
because of police & bullets.
They played with my love
making me a puppet.
Bad lnspector & bad rogue.
That's why l'm crying.
You come and you go...
Shruthi, aren't you going to class today?
lt's getting late.

Ask her to vacate the place.
Truly, she left.
There was a Muslim guy in Dubai...

You never offered Upma even once.
Not at all!

But l've come to you now.
Why are you looking at me?
Shall l tell you a story?
There was a son called Sathyamoorthy.
His father Shanmuga Vel,
after his retirement,
made his son to join the police department.
When his son was on duty
as an undercover agent,
he got caught by a man
known as Ali Bhai.
Will Ali Bhai men spare him?
His men beat him severely and
brought him to his father.
Ali Bhai is a bad man, isn't he?
So, he is going to kill him
as his father watches it.
l'm not afraid of death.
Sathyamoorthy lPS.
Yes l'm, you dog!
Ali Bhai, please don't kill him.
What will you do man?
- Hey, keep quiet.
Ali Bhai, please leave him.
l'll fall at your feet.
Father, don't fall at his feet.
Fall at my feet.
- No, father.
Fall at my feet.
- No father.
Fall at my feet.
- Father, no...
Hey, look at me...dear, look at me...
Saravana, why did you sacrifice
your life for me?
lsn't he your son, Sathyamoorthy?
Death will force you to tell the truth.
lf he is Saravanan,
then who is Sathyamoorthy?
He isn't your son, is he?
No. He isn't my son.
My foster son.
But l loved him as my own son.
Why did you kill him?
Who is your son?
Tell me, who is your son?
Tell me.
Sathyamoorthy lPS.
lndian Police Service, Batch 57.
Sathyamoorthy, son of Shanmuga Vel.
He is my son.
l'm really proud to call him as my son!
What else a father can wish more than this?
Only a Police man can feel this happiness.
You scoundrels can't feel it.
Am l right?
- Right.
Where is he now?
He is under cover.
He is on duty for 24 hours and 365 days
Tell me, what is he doing now?
Treatment...medical treatment.
He's treating the country
to get rid of virus like you.
He's in the midst of an operation
to eliminate criminals like you.
An lPS surgery for the
welfare of this country.
l was an upright Police officer.
So, a criminal like you killed his mother.
That's why he is staying away
to protect me from any danger.
l've come now, haven't l?
You didn't come.
He made you to come here.
My son Sathyamoorthy
killed your man Guru.
That's why you came back
to lndia from Dubai.
Master plan?
That means if you're alive,
l'll be dead, ain't l?
One is here, where is the other one?
You're sure to kill me,
whether l disclose about him or not.
But you will definitely know him.
Because he will kill you.
You won't die without seeing him.
He will stand before you.
What? Got scared?
Every human has a sixth sense.
Some times it works for
baddies like you also.
Am l right?
You can easily kill me.
Your count down starts immediately.
He will kill each & everyone of you.
November 12th, today, my death day.
l know.
November 13th is your death day.
Nice meeting you, Mr Shanmuga Vel.
Will your son come to see your body?
He will.
l thought of killing him today.
But Police have seized the area.
Don't ask me anything now.
Do you know who he is?
- l don't know.
Sathyamoorthy, you live as you wish.
But be brave & fight for justice.
That's the right path of life.
l'm proud to call you as
good Police man than my son.
Aim to destroy evil.
That's ultimate living.
You're a one man army.
Serve the people.
Die for the country.
Live like a legend.
Victory to lndia!
Bhai, he is here only.
l'll inform you when he leaves.
That terrorist Ali Bhai should be
sentenced to death.
He should have a miserable death.
Without knowing that he
is an lPS Officer,
l've disclosed about
bomb blast in school.
He'll drop it as he told me about it.
He will think so.
But l'll do it.
He may use someone else to do it.
He has many plans
for November 14th.
November 14th is my target.
What l wished should happen that day.
For that, he shouldn't be alive.
He knows all our secrets.
So, change the location.
l'm not able to take any
action against him now.
Because my daughter...
l'll go there, sir.
Please, don't leave me & go.
Either l'll die or those criminals.
You consider me as a
criminal for a day more.
Sir, till then please take care of her.
Sir, me?

Take the jeep.
- Yes sir.
Sir, atleast today, you do your duty.

Ask him where he is.
Or else, l'll kill you.
Yes Bhai..
Has he left the place?
- No.

You be in a safe place.
Don't be inside the city.
Hey l know. l'm safe.
Where are you now?

Okay then. l'll talk to you later.
Start the vehicle. Make it fast.
Shit!
Yes, tell me...
- He has come to your place.
Who told him?
l told him.
You stupid! Why did you tell him?
Bhai, there was no other way.
When you phoned me,
he was next to me.
He was pointing a gun
on my forehead.
Where are you now?
Bhai, he is already inside Binny Mills.
He has come here. Run fast.
Yes tell me...
How much will you pay, if l kill him?
Have you seen millions?
- No.

Open the door.
Break the door
Make it fast.
Shoot him.
Shoot him.
Shoot him.
lf you meet an upright Police officer,
you will wet your pant.
Oh my God!
Why did you shoot them all?
Do you consider them as
humans or animals?
They are all criminals.
Very difficult to get them.
Hey, l can find police men
like you overnight.
But where can l find such criminals?
They have been with me from
their childhood days.
l'll not spare you.
l'll not spare you alive.
Oh my God! Stop it, man.
Stop it, dear. lt's painful.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Look, l'll pay you how much ever you want.
You join me.
You can live like a King.
What will you get for
being a Police officer?
lf you die on duty,
you will get minimum Rs 50000.
That's it.
A black ribbon on chest
mourning for a day.
Come on... l'll show you the heaven.
You bargained a deal, right?
Didn't materialise?
Sir...
Remove a thorn with a needle.
Sir, it's me.
Your daughter is safe.
Ali Bhai is dead.
Sir, bad news is that our lnspector
Govindan is also dead.
Sir, what do you mean?
Once l decide,
l'll never back off.
