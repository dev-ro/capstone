How is being 12 years in prison...
locked in a cell
no bigger than a bath...
enclosed with a psychopath
who robbed a bank?
Imagine that.
Locked in bathroom for 12 minutes,
12 hours, 12 days,
a year, try to concentrate that...
12 summers, 12 Christmas,
12 years new...
When you enter your
daughters go to school...
when salts are women.
Living their lives, working,
probably dysfunctional...
definitely frustrating.
Your daughters finished because they
lost his father at an early age.
I know what you tell your partner,
his girlfriend...
kill someone, you pay;
But it was not as simple as that.
Contributing factors,
so I'll take them 12 years ago.
I'll tell you about Louis and how
to know changed my life forever.
When you hit your man
I feel cursed ancestors.
It was the largest club doorman
the people.
Loui When people stopped coming
to greet him.
Attending the door with your team:
Rob and Sparky.
They were like a fan of Louis
and the club was his home.
Sparky go to the back door.
Loui had a warrant and was
not go beyond their limits.
But he was a thinker, he was a
philosopher of the "door".
He studied the art of fighting
without it.
Well... most of the time.
Rob was one of the most
great and generous you may know.
He also lived with his mother
and went to church almost daily.
And was Sparky.
Going to various places and had
some other business.
And I needed it, had a house
and a baby on the way.
Sparky always seized the
opportunity when it was easy...
and so Henessey (the scammer crazy)
went to see him.
Are you Henessey, no?
- That's my son.
No offense, but will have
to go through the front door.
I think it is because be.
Henessey always knew what
was the weakest point.
We partner, I have not seen.
He spoke with Sparky.
- Start working with me.
Yes, Sparky would turn weak
head Lout's world.
But first, I'll tell you about
me in those days.
He worked in a factory collecting
other shit.
Waiting until the weekend
to spend a few hours with my babies.
This is where they now
live with my ex...
in the place he called home.
Stop it.
And to think that he wrote poetry.
I did mourn.
Watch Dani.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on girls, to play with dad.
Good-bye.
Let Daddy.
Hurry. Wait for me.
Hurry. Wait for me.
Oh, I tumbaste cap, better pick.
Please do not do that again.
Yes, my girls, Kena and Elisa.
You would not want anything better.
Sometimes in the morning, passing
through looked like the gym and boxed.
I used to watch fascinated by the
brutality but was afraid to enter.
Until one day...
- You want to come and watch?
Yes, no problem.
Sign.
By the back door like a dog.
Loui, I was telling the guys
the other day. 'All right.
The judge was that he knew he had
happened between us.
He said, "Young man, have you thought
going to live alone?
And here's where it gets better...
takes the cigarette case,
opens it and says...
"This really is good."
When finished smoking, said get out
the devil and lock me up.
What's your name boy?
- Dani.
Guys this is Dani.
Says he wants to fight you
you do fatal.
Wow that well.
- I did not say that.
Hey, I'm kidding.
'All right.
Want to take a look.
Make him feel good.
Let's round.
Hello.
- Hello.
You're going to train.
I like virgins, make a
Please put me and pets.
You are about to hit,
1, 2, 3, 4, how O.K?
Yes, I felt very good.
But hitting leather is very different
fleeing to hit something.
And in those days ran from my fears.
And you could say that
I became an expert.
We're going but do not tell Mom.
No one will know about me.
Draw in the line,
try it with another color.
Henessey was at the bar
waiting for one of its employees.
And I knew I should not be there
in fractions of seconds.
But the girls were having fun
and very cold outside.
Thank you, I will...
We'll leave soon.
Dad, I want to stay.
Just a couple of minutes then.
- Fuck it!
Dad!
- All right!
Did someone say something?
- Go girl.
Just be careful with your aim.
What do I say?
The other arm, fast.
Come here.
- What was that?
One said he had children and
habarle could die.
What I can say?
They made me angry.
Damn.
Leave the poor man!
Hands off me out!
Help me.
- Please.
Leave it!
- Fuck him.
Come on, you can not lift.
Look at me.
What did you expect?
They have their rules.
I'm surprised you were there.
- It was by chance.
It is no place for children Daniel.
- There is no cartel.
You would have done the same.
I think not.
- Actually, no.
Your daughters were there,
should have done something.
Fuck!
I did it for my daughters
and do it again!
Need to relax.
And a new broom.
That does not get in the way.
That does not bother me.
I of the girls.
Daddy's here.
- Dad arrived.
Hello.
Good at two.
Look at you, as they have grown.
For God Dani, What happened to you?
You know, at work...
Beat him in a bar.
It's not what you think,
just walked by a...
I can not really, not the
I can leave it for a second.
Even were there, I...
What if something happened to them?
Was the day?
I told you, do not harm girls.
You want to have this conversation
now in front of girls?
Wherever.
You know I can!
Why are you punishing me?
Did I punishing you?
- Yes.
I'll call my lawyer now,
girls come, now!
Everyone laughs at my back,
I swore...
There was a moment when I believed you.
Let Angela...
- Leave us alone!
Let Angela. Let them go out with me.
Do not do this.
Shit.
Girls, do not worry.
Come on, girls are angry.
Elisa!
Call the police if you do not go.
Please Angela.
Bitch!
Damn cow!
Sorry.
It'll be okay.
Dad and go away.
- You're a fucking cow!
Write that poem to Angela
was the most dangerous thing I've done.
There was blood everywhere...
but what hurt me
was that she was right.
I screwed up and began
to be pregnant again.
And it fell to me like rain.
You're nobody!
You're nobody!
I hate myself!
I hate myself!
You should leave, call the police.
They all laugh at me ...!
Call the police!
Sorry Daniel.
Daddy? Dad?
- Let me talk to me.
Mom told me that I first.
- Mom?
What is the problem?
Dad? Mom says you can
come and get us.
Move over, I'm so tired.
I hate to sleep with you.
When I'll have a house dad
a bed just for me.
Dad will never have a home.
- Yes the will.
No, not so.
The will, as promised.
Well, always makes promises.
'Dad said.
Dad is weak. At any rate
is a loser.
Mom says you can not
expect anything from Dad...
because he is weak.
Seeing my daughters did not know
how long could endure.
I have two beautiful daughters, but
are orphans, no father...
at least not one that can respect.
It was time to stop running
and start fighting.
I owed it to my daughters.
Sorry.
'Come on girls, come 15 minutes late.
What did I say? Discipline,
healthy mind for a healthy body.
Missed classes last week,
so come and warm.
All right.
'Goodbye Daddy.
Please do not pick them up later,
has already happened several times.
Come on girls, now.
Help me with these books.
The lend you some day.
You want to fight with Sparky?
- I can?
Take it soft.
He always says that.
Do you know some?
Yes.
- Well.
He is good in the ring.
The first rule of the fight,
is to fight.
Sales for her, not you hide.
When things return flee you.
None of this is real,
to get out of here.
Look at me! Nothing is real.
Collide gloves.
Sparky brand.
Make it fails.
That's it.
Come!
- Get up!
Go to the Son.
Come on, hit me.
Come!
Sparky!
- Enough!
What's wrong?!
I fight alone.
- I know!
Sparky the animal!
- Sparky skunk.
Come on, get up.
What time is dinner?
- At 7:00 p.m.
7:00 pm What?
Yes What time come?
Is my mom?
I knew it was a vagina.
I will not be able to love.
Because I'm doing
a favor to a friend.
Horita not remember who you are.
You're never home.
At least I do not live with my mom
Do you think that is normal?
Hey! Leave my mom out
this.
Just goes to coffee.
I'll call you later.
You're a sick man.
Do you think doing something about it?
- Your gloves.
Do not worry about it.
See you.
For the first time in my life
I defended myself and was like shit.
I was beaten to a pulp but
I felt good.
Louis said something about fear
stuck with me:
"Everyone feels fear, some
only the hide better than others.
When you start to feel
that control...
and use it to your advantage.
Make fear your friend."
Come.
Hurry.
Dani??
- Louis?
Up.
- Are you sure?
Come on girls.
Hello girls, I'm Louis.
- Hello.
Are you okay?
- Yes, what about you?
Right.
Are good girls?
That good.
Be found in some eventually place.
Come on, get off.
Ladies??
- How do you say?
Behave yourselves.
- What do they say?
Thank you.
'Nothing.
Goodbye.
Good-bye.
Wait. Is that all?
Yeah Come here.
I love them.
- And we to you.
Goodbye Daddy.
Good-bye.
She hates me.
Are you married Louis?
I suppose you're expecting.
I'm not looking.
The only met years.
I lost it, stuff happens.
No feeling lasts forever.
Remember this when you want
conquer fear.
This is how you will achieve.
Do not be afraid of your
reactions to confrontation.
It is said that there is no fear
but fear itself.
It's as close to the truth,
of what people might think...
I devoured every book I gave Louis.
I savored every word.
My knowledge is not useful
without action.
And I had to put my media
in the table and crush...
tear them to pieces before I rend me.
Keep it up.
- Come.
You come you?
- Yes, a fight.
Hello.
- Hey.
Do you think it would be nice if
properly trained?
Yes, of course.
Sure you can.
I mean regularly.
Yes.
'You'd better find someone.
Best clothing changes.
I can take you somewhere?
I'm tired of Billy.
How are you?
Are you hurt?
A couple of weeks will do well.
- Yes.
Yes?
Well, boy did were right.
Or not.
There are a few jobs
by if you're free.
Did you fall?
Whenever you're falling.
Do not abrochas cords.
Come, come and play in his room.
Goodbye Daddy.
'Goodbye girls.
I do not know what you're up Dani.
I want to spend time with you.
What are you talking about?
It's just boxing.
They're supposed to be caring for them.
Affect girls in their classes.
Yes, you will not go.
- Yes I will!
You're not responsible enough.
Irresponsibility?
I'm his father.
What if you get depressed again?
- Fuck you!
What did you say?
- Fuck you!
Yes, that is.
I'll call the lawyer.
Shit!
Are you kidding me and my daughters...
and if you try to get into
means you will face me.
What do you do?!
Just you be depressed,
that if you can.
You know what? You're nobody.
But I have the right
to see my daughters.
I can forbid the see whenever I want!
A phone call!
- Do it. Come on, do it!
Call your damn lawyer!
I'll take them when and why
hours that I want...
and if you don't like fuck!
Okay, I screwed up.
I was wrong.
I was blinded, I was caught.
We divorced, you kept
the house, the car, the girls...
sympathy, what about me?
What do I have?
Just live in a shack.
I tell you: do you want to fuck me over?
Go ahead, do it.
One day I'll do mine.
The Art of War.
Loui lived in a world of codes,
was a gladiator, a samurai of town ..
Was the master of the fight
three seconds.
I decided to imitate him, become him.
Discover their secrets.
Goodbye Loui.
- See you.
I will spend tonight.
- If I'm in the door raisins.
See you later.
Do you mind if I go?
At club??
- Yes.
You dance? Dani?
- A little.
That's part of boxing.
Spend about 9:00 pm.
Like?
- It's beautiful.
Thank you.
- It was a pleasure.
How is he?
He or she.
He began to move last night.
Do not tell me.
Really?
- Yes.
Are you a man, right?
Sadly I have to go.
Do not be late, I promise.
Look who's in the queue.
Sorry.
Go boy, I hoped.
You look good partner.
- Thank you.
Wait to see how we work.
Where do you think you're going?
'I'm with Sparky.
Sorry, it's me.
- Are you sure?
He's an old friend
is visiting the city.
Hi Dani.
- Hello.
Go shirt.
Hello Louis.
- Hello Dona.
It was the first time I
I felt part of something.
The guys welcomed me
and I got a place.
They were like brothers,
had a kind of code.
And I loved him.
And had two foci,
Rob do you remember?
The dealer, the guy
with all those jewels?
You're right.
I had about 24 channels
tattoos and much...
and a large one in the back...
Stop it already!
For and Sparky!
Come on, get up!
Out! Out! Out!
Where the fuck out?
It always starts when Gotta Give.
He had not even finished the story.
I've counted 10 times.
Come on, open the door!
Déjenmelos.
'Come here and say that again.
Bite the concrete.
- There is a vagina.
Come! Do your thing!
Come!
I'll take charge,
just you and me in the corner
away from the camera.
Come on, you're the big mouth.
I'll be back!
We all will!
Since there are 4 of you,
do not tell me that you will return,
do it now.
What about you?
Do not you sums?
All against me, come on.
Listen, no offense...
it's nothing personal.
Yes, that's what I thought.
'We're angry.
One is some technique.
Make some noise and an army
can lift your spirits. Sun Tzu.
Who the fuck is Sun Tzu?
- I know all appointments.
Yes, Louis was definitely a master
in the art of fighting without fighting.
It was very popular,
everybody admired...
especially the ladies.
And for me the girls were forbidden,
I was in heaven.
But there was another view of the club.
A darkness that seemed
hidden from Louis...
traffickers.
People liked to dance but
also likes "fun".
Rob did not like drugs and turned his
personal crusade to get
rid of traffickers.
While Sparky's coming
through the front door...
Rob pulled them out through the back,
put them to sleep...
took away the money and what
will remain drug.
It was just a copy and told my mom
I had the wrong disc.
Yes, yes, it is.
Did you know they were
not going to fight?
- Yes.
How did you know?
The fight is the fight
and do not talk about that.
You never stop talking about it.
I think you should have
Caring for a shot.
Well you're wrong.
- Do not know the reaction?
Actually, I agree with Dani.
But saying and doing
are different things.
If you do not stop and think
you are in serious trouble.
And they were police?
- What police?
They are just like us,
just like you and me.
The family, children...
ordinary people.
Do not concentrate on that.
Do not get ahead of the curve.
Everyone deserves the opportunity
get away.
I do not want to get hit,
or anything like that
unless there is no other option.
We have to wait...
were to be shat scary.
We do not talk more about it.
She sure is not like us.
The first night in the club, you scared?
I never felt so.
I got into that world.
For goalkeeper's a question
very simple in form...
Can you "do" when needed?
Answer yes and you'll get the job.
Indeed, Rob went to church
but had another reason...
was effective in its 700
acres irrigated in Africa.
Hurry. Wait for me.
Hurry. Wait for me.
Hurry. Wait for me.
Where are you going?
Me!
- What do you release?!
Ye I warned you!
We find the fool.
- Divirtámoslo!
Be careful what you say.
- It's cool lately!
It is very stubborn.
- What do you have?
Now you're fucked!
Girls Run, run!
Open the door.
Open the damn door!
You're dead!
You run away from me??!
What's going on?!
I'm calling the police.
If you kick the flames also ass!
Please let into my daughters.
Use it.
Come on, use it!
Come on, hit me!
You're dead!
Yes?! Damn!
Go away to hell!
Come!
Never no nearer my daughters!
They are my daughters!
Do not even touch!
You're crazy!
Do not mess with me!
To hell!
Come! Come!
We're not done.
We will return!
I'll be waiting!
Come!
Go away to hell!
It is all over.
All is well.
The magician had a magic show...
and every week would a new recipe...
a fantastic sweet
chocolate or a tree...
You could smell the scent
of strawberries...
they were planted in the
back of the shop.
Mr. Muss was the magician cat.
And I always knew if I had a recipe
good...
because the cat moved her tail
to tell her to leave him out.
It was 6:00 p.m. and after eating
roasted sardines...
the old wizard was in her kitchen.
Dad?
- Yes?
That man said he would return?
They always say that.
Go back to sleep.
Give me a kiss.
How long have you been there?
- 30 Years.
A couple of hours.
- When is enough?
When you release the pressure.
I love to do.
But you can do.
- Yes?
Anyone can.
You really think that?
- Just see it.
All things are created,
first in the mind,
and then in reality,
you see it and then you do.
I have to find the time to do so.
You're making excuses,
is not the time.
If you want to know why
find the time to be here.
Got the same time as the others.
You have the same 24 hours mine
like Sparky and Rob...
even the great Cassius Clay
is 24 hours.
If you take it as recreation,
come from time to time.
Vives emotion, is sufficient.
But if you want more...
have more, You know?
I'm not talking about two times week,
is too comfortable, no shine for you.
I'm talking about two times a day.
Live it, Breathe, marínalo.
When you stop hiding,
run out of problems.
The feeling of fear is so natural
the need to urinate.
When you're hungry, eat,
you are thirsty, drink.
He was learning to control it,
to feel it, deflect it.
When you feel fear you feel strong.
A career...
Come.
Lie Down back.
Stay there.
Be careful.
It's just paint.
Police?
I want to report a mugging.
What is your address?
- It ? 6 Street Fox
I think I know who did it.
Hello.
- Hello.
Here you go. I bring the gain
directly to me.
Can you do it?
Here you go.
There are 5000 for you.
Loui sorry, know what I mean.
No, I do not know.
What!
A funeral? Does your dog died?
What happened?
You have no justification,
and is a habit for you.
I know, I'm sorry.
You know Abigail.
What are you doing tonight Daniel?
Can you make the turn?
You got a problem with that?
I do not mind.
I do not cause an upset.
Back, said back!
I said: What's in your wallet?!
Yes, you, do not you hear me!
All quiet.
Bitch.

Yes, for coughs and colds, but

But they are effective. Once the

Leave your drinks, or any thing.
Ice cream for later.

Robbert's dad.
He's dead.
We never wanted for anything with him.
It was not perfect, but who
of us are?
She is seriously damaged.
You mention my father and all
becomes "We never wanted for anything"
"Was working", seems to be
I forgot how much we beat.
Faggot.
Well... The next day it dawned
face all swollen.
Huge lumps rather than face.
The huge nose... Dont

I do not need more.
Goalkeeper Danny.
I said you got

Not anymore, okay?
If you go to my daughters...
Look, that guy works for me.
Let me tell you, that we 're clear.
Stay away from my business.
Next time it will not be
only a drawing on the wall.
Come.
Angela returned to treat me well, again,
and started to win again...
their respect, and then put
my children in danger,
but this might be more difficult fix.
Fear was present again.
And this time worse than ever.
Rob was trying to
recover all the lost time.
Taxing as if there is no tomorrow.
What's in your pocket?
My wallet.
Sign.
Advance.
Hey, Simon, man passes.
Move.
They are friends from work.
We thought we would have
company tonight.
Hey, look around.
The doorman!
Hey, behave.
Just finish entering.
Forward.
Seeing Mick and Simon, I account
how much progress had
since I met Louis.
You always have options. Stay
as you are, and shape up.
There were my friends, but
felt that was leaving behind.
Lie there...
What is it, boy?
Is Sparky?
Well, no matter.
Wait, I have to revisarte.
I need to check your companion.
There it is.
It's for personal use.
And Personal? Enough to
a family of 18 people?
I would not do that.
I'm not you.
Or I can call the police
if you prefer.
I can use that phone.
You crucified partner.
Hey, partner, there is always a
cross to bear.
Enough!
Go!
Hey, stop that!
Out, out!
I was fiddling with the lady!
He was playing his ass!
Lie!
I was looking!
I was just having fun.
Yes, I'll break your face!
Yeah, and so I
jumps up with his fists.
You wanted to leave you?
You caught me by surprise!
Yes, and now nobody cares.
Yeah, man, stop that.
What about you?
Go, Simon, take it.
Yes, take it before your turn ass.
Bastard!
Enough, enough!
I was having fun, social,
you're out of control!
Ah, come on now.
By God, what about you?
There are a couple of old
Go in and.
Wait, Simon, eh!
Yes, good night!
Pussy...
One came to the club last night
asking about you.
What do you mean?
He had a fucking pharmacy above.
Why not commanded to my house?
Medical help is always needed.
Nice car.
Yes, should be worth a lot.
Someone is making a lot.
Yes, but apparently not
is sleeping peacefully.
Dude, stop that now.
Chao, girls.
Listen, your friend Rob,
is despicable.
It's getting bad business.
And I need to teach him to behave.
Billy, I'm not sure about that...
because I have no control over
these two.
Maybe I could sell for you...
and you could stop
send people a while.
Tell you what I'll do.
I will continue sending
the people and you let go...
that is why you pay, after all.
And you're going to do, because
if you do not, I will.
Understand me clear.
Here is what I say and not you.
Do you understand?
I'm depressed, Sparky.
I need you more at home.
Look at this place!
It looks like a pigsty.
I do not deserve...
I just...
I can not with this.
I go with my mother.
I'll tell you, take a cab and the
way you do something
Because you look like shit.
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
You, out!
Give me that!
You gotta go, man.
Excuse me?
You're selling drugs at the club.
You go.
Are you asking me?
I'm sending.
You?
Yes, myself.
Where is Sparky?
Nothing Sparky, if you sell you go.
Maybe I should ask Sparky on that.
Since I paid the tax for this.
You're a liar shit.
Get out of here!
Damn rat!
Arise!
Did drugs!
I was selling. He says
you knew this.
You get paid the tax.
I know that guy.
You, remember that the type
the other day I checked myself.
Well, I know but not
well, he was doing a favor.
Yes, getting pills the back door.
So what you mean me?
Are you accusing me of something?
I'm not accusing you, Sparky.
Just repeat what he said.
Yes?
What did he say?
Say what?
You said you stuffed, you knew that.
For it is a fagot liar
more pussy for you and believe.
I do not believe him, I said
I was a liar.
I told you you would get no
to work with these people.
Enough!
I'm going, I do not need this shit!
Is this a conspiracy, no?
What people?
With people of Hennessy.
He's lying.
He's lying!
Come on, I know!
Who do they trust?
I know who to trust.
Damn!
Fuck you, Rob!
What the fuck you all!
Sparky!
Are you sure about this?
It's what he said.
Tomorrow morning I
try talking to Sparky...
No comment on any of this.
And you, take care.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Listen, I just want to chat.
Yes, of course.
Faggots like you always accompanied.

Why did not you go with your mother?
Where have you been?
What kind of question is that?
You know where.
Do not tell me at the Club
because I called there.
Wow, now you're watching, not!
Do not start again, was in the Club!
Lies, lies!
You're crazy, you know!
You are crazy, crazy!
What about this? Do you earned in
The Club also?
This is for us.
Helen...
For us and the baby.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sparky...
I hear...
Billy must speak. Police
is hanging around home.
I want my money and get out this.
So you have to pick package.
I do not know what package you speak.
And if I knew I was not going
collect.
For you are a tremendous fagot.
So go forgetting my number forever
What was I supposed to do with him?
Listen, what do you think
I'm going to do with the package?
And keep it away from me, okay?
I need my money, Billy, I...
If you're dreaming of me out
something better wake up, son.
Because if I imagine something,
I'll fly with one stone.
I will kill your wife,
everybody, you know?
Fuck you!
Damn!
Rob and Sparky were my brothers
from school.
But Sparky belonged Hennessy now.
And Rob was attacking
the only way he knew.
Louis never had that talk
with Sparky.
In fact, no one had.
Okay, I will.
You are very spoiled, Thank you, Mom?
A walk!
Hear.
Rob, do not say anything, not
say anything. Just listen.
I have no time to ask
forgiveness or to explain anything.
But I need you to do me a favor.
Need you to pick and miss...
as far as you can go
and for as long as possible...
Rob??
Rob??
Rob ...!
Rob ...!
I leave a message, Sparky.
Now busy.
Leave it!
Look for me to me, Billy!
I'm guilty, Billy!
Billy!
Damn!
Damn!
Take him to the wall.
Take him!
Siéntenlo! Feel

Did you see now?
You're fucked.
Put him hands in the wall.
Now you will see, you'll see a fagot.
Ah, damn you...
What is it, boy?
Do not have a tongue?
You're not so talkative now, eh?
You're not so talkative now?
Wait, stay, fagot!
Do you think that I could fuck?
Where is your fucking representative?
Where is it, eh?
Where, eh?
When we arrived, still was resisting.
As if he had been Loui waiting for.
To protect by last.
Quiet, quiet.
What the fucking ambulance?
I'll see.
I have it, I have it.
Well...
So... Who was,
who?
Hennessy...
This shit will kill you.
Is he coming?
Yes, it's coming.
Ma...
Cold... on feet...
I'll bring some socks...
I have fear...
Loui, I...
We are all afraid.
He died...
Dead...
All right, Ma.
All is well.
My baby...
Okay, okay...
My baby...
When was the ambulance,
I felt myself collapsing.
All fears that thought
have successfully returned.
And now he was alone.
My new family was dead.
Rob was dead.
Loui wanted revenge.
And Sparky was destroyed, guiltily.
Dad, hurry up a bit.
Come on, do it for always.
Dad, please.
Is the park!
Daddy please.
Come dad. Do the Dance
comic.
Come dad.
Do not do this.
I have to go.
I have plans, I'm going out.
I can not stay.
Then tell them.
My friend is dead.
Do you understand?
Dead.
Somebody killed him.
I have to go.
Do not do anything stupid.
You'll have to choose.
Seriously.
If you go you've chosen.
Do not come over here.
I meant it!
Maldic ...!
Danny...
I almost had a heart attack!
What are you doing?
Goofing...
Goofing off??
Bobeando?? Bastard...
I always wanted to be coach.
Boxing.
Train children, not only males.
A girls too.
Girls have to learn to defend.
I always wanted to do.
I think I found the time.
I wanted to be a writer.
Why write what?
Books, plays...
About what?
I do not know. I am a writer who
not to write about.
Now you will have on what to write.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Please
What's going on?
What did you do?
Please listen...
Sign.
Danny...
What about the girls?
Oh, God...
You are full of blood.
I need to see the girls.
Please.
Just let me see them.
Please.
Wait there.
God...
Oh, God...
Sought Danny O'Grady.
Are you here?
Yes, he's here.
So here I am 12 years later.
Standing in front of the jail.
Wondering what it would be.
My girls became women precious.
My girls, because they always
I was when I needed.
What about Dad?
We thought that it would be outside.
He should.
Yes, Louis saved my life many times.
He did not allow catched me.
He said that my girls needed his dad.
Who was with you, Loui?
Who was the type of mask?
The Fox fucked.
We know it was Danny.
No. It was not Danny.
It's a family man.
Been here all overnight.
What?
Is there a problem?
The police knew.
But they could not prove.
Is alive thanks to the devices, Loui.
It will not happen overnight.
I just.
Hennessy died in a room.
Sparky another.
When guilt is gone, and had peace.
I stopped being a goalkeeper,
violence stopped,
I was at the factory, only
the time it took me...
write everything in my first book.
Watch my back.
A history of goalkeepers.
Well...
Not everything.
So... How does it feel
spending 12 years in jail?
I can not even begin to imagine.
