THE MOVIE
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!
Just a picture, Prime Minister! Please!
Prime Minister Sellers, may we have your comment?
Prime Minister Sellers, correct?
Let me go!
The terrorist`s name is Cammy White.
She is an operative with the
intelligence agency in London.
We are currently interrogating her at Base B.
She seems to have no memories of the past 3 years.
- What do you mean?
- She`s been mind-controlled.
We should be able to find out how Shadowloo...
...is able to create these highly-skilled killers
by analyzing Cammy.
We know that Shadowloo has been
gathering informating on street fighters...
...throughout the world to
create terrorists like Cammy.
Are they turning street fighters into terrorists?
This is a fighter named Sagat. He`s known as the Muay
Thai "King of Fighters" in Thailand. HeÂ´s considered a hero there.
This one`s named Bison, a boxer
who was thrown out of the boxing
world for his viciousness in the ring.
And this is the Spanish fighter, Balrog,
known as the "Mad Anaconda".
These three fighters have been recruited by
Shadowloo as Vega`s personal troubleshooters.
Crimes commited by Shadowloo have been steadily
incresing every year. I think it`s time to take them down.
I guess the time has come to ask the
American military to join the investigation.
Lt. Commander Guile, there is
someone from Interpol here to see you.
Interpol?
I`m Chun Li.
What do you want?
I`m here to discuss the joint
investigation of Shadowloo with you.
- Vega is going to be stopped by me.
- What are you saying?
I`m saying I don`t need any help taking Vega down.
Lt. Commander Guile, you`ve been
ordered to cooperate by your own military!
That`s enough. When it
comes to Vega, I work alone.
- I`ve been waiting for you.
- Show it to me.
Yes, sir.
This is the latest cyborg monitor, recently
upgraded with a new high-performance computer.
Any pictures captured by this cyborg are
instantly sent via the comm satellite...
...to the main supercomputer here at headquarters.
We`ve already arrenged the replacements
of the old monitor robots with these cyborgs.
Good.
- By the way, have you located that fighter yet?
- Not yet, sir.
How difficult is it to hunt down the one
man in the world who could beat Sagat?
I`m cross-checking all data about
every fighter throughout the world.
Does this Ryu really have as great a
fighting ability as the data indicates?
I`ve estimated that each fighter`s ability
is limited to a maximum of 2000.
You must find him as soon as possible.
Send cyborgs to the Himalayans if you need to.
Shoryuken!
(Dragon Punch)
Ryu, what is that you see in front of your fist?
Okay, take a break.
- But before we have breakfast, go draw
water from the valley. - Yes, sir!
Hey, you bastard! Why didn`t you go
after me harder? Are you holding back on me?
Hey, stop kidding around! I didn`t hold back!
You don`t know, do you?
I suppose I should accept it, because the time`s
gonna come when I`ll be fighting you for real.
I`m sorry that I`m late.
It`s unusual for you to be late.
My opponent at the match was a little tougher than
I thought. I spent more time on him than I planned.
- And how did it go?
- Guess.
You won another title match?
Basically...
Hey, hasn`t Fei Long arrived? Where`s the
leading man? We can`t shoot the movie without him!
That`s odd, I thought I saw him headed this way.
Why does he keep doing
this to us? Enough already!
-Hey, Fei Long.
- What`s going on?
- Entertainment, just some entertainment.
- Entertainment?
A young guy is being pulled into the ring.
- I didn`t say anything. - We heard you
criticizing while you were watching the match...
Let`s see if you`re as strong as you talk!
This should be interesting.
Even though you`re a big movie star now, you still
love hanging around in the local joints, don`t you?
That guy looks pretty strong.
You fight pretty well.
Allow me to be your next challenger.
You look like a decent fighter. What`s your name?
My name is Ryu. I`m just another Japanese
tourist travelling around.
I don`t want to fight.
Not yet! It`s not over yet!
Let me show you what I`ve been
keeping in reserve. Get ready!
Shi En Kyaku!
Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku!
I see, you`re Ryu. I remember hearing about you.
Several years ago, a fighter took out...
...the "King Of Fighters", Sagat, and then disappeared.
That fighter was Japanese and went by the
name of Ryu. That fighter was you, Ryu wasn`t it?
Last I heard, Sagat`s been training
intensely under the guise of Shadowloo.
Shadowloo? What`s that?
- You don`t know?
- I don`t.
It`s a criminal organization that deals in
weapons and drug trafficking around the world.
Sagat has joined a crime syndicate...
Ryu... we will meet again.
Ken! I`m here to fight you.
You`re quite persistent. I don`t
play "Street Fighter" any more.
It doesn`t matter where a warrior chooses to fight.
This is stupid.
What`s to be gained if we fight each other like this?
The honorable rank of warrior. My honor
as a warrior is at stake when we fight.
As I said, this is crazy! Anyway you
don`t stand a chance.
No one can stop me...
... except for Ryu.
Ryu? The missing wandering fighter?
Don`t even compare me with such trash!
I see... you`re stronger than I expected!
I like it!
Shoryuken!
What`s wrong?
Why don`t you finish me off?
Ryu, where are you? We need to settle things.
Are you all right?
I`ve caused a problem...
I see... your mother is sick.
I`m sorry. Go and buy some more with this. Here.
What`s wrong?
Bastard...
Bastard...
What`s happening? I can`t move...
I feel power...
It`s strong!
Wait.
I give up the match.
What do you mean by "give up"?!
The spirits tell me that there is one stronger than I.
My friend, are you telling me that you`re going
to lose because of some mumbo-jumbo?
I surrender. I am the loser of this match.
Now it`s time for me to collect my prize.
I`ve never felt such a strong fighting spirit.
You stay strong...
- Who were those guys?
- They`re Shadowloo terrorists.
Shadowloo?
- Here`s your change.
- I see, I see. Thank you.
- Hey! Half of this money is yours.
- Money?
I might have lost that match back
there if you hadn`t been there.
Take it. Both of us are Japanese fighters.
C`mon, just take it.
Are you certain they killed Vahaan?
Positive. And the cyborg that was monitoring...
...also caught an unidentified fighter near
the location of the assassination. We`re looking into it.
Anything else?
I`d like to show you something interesting
that we received from a cyborg in Seattle.
Okay. I`ll be right there.
What is so important that you would call me here?
Please take a look at this video.
This one seems to be very strong, and
I found something very interesting.
I overlaid this to the image we have
of this Ryu that we`re looking for.
- Who is this man?
- Ken Masters.
We have the data of his title matches
on computer in command section...
... but I never thought of him as having any
connection to Ryu. - What do you mean?
Both Ken and Ryu trained under the
same teacher for over 10 years in Japan.
They`re fighting styles and abilities are about the same.
The same? However, their potencial
fighting abilities are different.
We haven`t received the latest information on
Ryu yet but it could be either the computer...
...has made an error in it`s calculations or Ryu himself
hasn`t been able to activate the full potencial of his power.
Ryu was a fellow student.
I think it might be interesting to use Ken
as our next Psycho-Kinetic weapon.
The American President, Ed Pressman, has been a
stubborn promoter of the military control proposal...
...so his security has become
much tighter than we expected.
Our plans to assassinate the
president must be done perfectly.
It will not fail as long as I train
him with my Psycho-Power.
There is, however, the matter of Cammy.
Cammy served her purpose.
She`s currently being interrogated by Interpol.
I do not care. Her job has been
completed. Leave her there.
We also have a monitor keeping watch on
Cammy, who`s in custody at the Interpol Building.
Let me see.
- We know that you`re a special agent of British
Intelligence. - I don`t remember a thing.
I don`t understand why a member of the British Secret Service would assassinate the prime minister under the orders of Shadowloo.
- I don`t remember a thing...
-Cammy, you were mind-controlled.
I`m trying to find any clues on where
and how you were controlled.
Try to remember something.
I don`t remember a thing...
Leave her there. My Psycho-Power
can`t be identified by anyone on Interpol.
But if we leave her there as she is...
I will deal with her later. You should
be concentrating on finding Ryu.
I want you to bring him to me
by whatever means possible.
I see. Should I place an order
to catch Ken in North America?
You don`t need to. It will be my
pleasure to catch this one in my trap.
What are you doing?
- It`s against regulations to investigate on your own.
- What a pain in the ass you are, woman.
I`m going to run you over if
you don`t get out of my way.
Go right ahead.
Lt. Commander Guile, I understand how you
feel having your best friend killed by Vega.
Does Interpol always invade other people`s privacy?
I`m sorry, but I read your file.
You`re not the only one who
hates Vega for personal reasons.
- You can`t beat Vega just with talk.
- So why don`t you test my strength, then?
I don`t have time to play games with you.
Vega also killed my father!
But I`m an agent of Interpol. Destroying
Shadowloo has priority over any personal grudges.
If there`s any honor within you as an Air force
Lt. Commander, Guile, please help us.
I don`t like pushy women. Are you getting in or not?
I`m getting in, of course!
Why is there a monitor at a nightclub?
Because in that nightclub is one
skilled fighter named Deejay.
Fuckin`punks like you can`t
follow my music. Get out!
Shithead!
I ain`t doing nothing!
I`m Guile, Lt. Commander, U.S. Air Force.
Yeah, what do you want? Are you
one of my fans?
You`ve been marked by Shadowloo.
Yahoo! That`s one big badass
motherfucker, right? I`m honored.
I`m not kidding! You won`t be able to perform
your music if Shadowloo has its hooks on you.
You`re joking, right?
Why would they mark me?
They`re collecting data on famous fighters.
- That doesn`t concern me.
- Yes, it does concern you.
Your data has been sent to Shadowloo
because of him.
That`s a robot? Was it some blow-up doll?
It`s a monitor cyborg. It`s how Shadowloo collects
its information... it`s controlled by their computer.
Tell your friends. Be careful because
things like these are hanging around.
Guile... He`s joined up with Interpol and
continues to rise against me.
Well, Balrog, how would you like to
make this cute agent woman your pet?
She`s beautiful, isn`t she?
A little agent girl trying to avenge
her father`s death...
How brave. Don`t you agree?
All right, connect me with Las Vegas.
The world`s leading underground figures
have all arrived. Everything`s fine.
Yes. I`ll report to command
section if anything happens. I see.
They`re starting to crack down on us.
Will the next operation be all right?
We`ve taken the necessary precautions.
5000 kilos of coke to London this time.
Tell the Commander-in-Chief to
contact us as soon as possible.
Certainly.
Thank you for waiting. The
fighting event is about to start.
Please gather in the hall.
Ladies and gentlemen, I`m proud
to present to you tonight`s fighters.
The King of the Russian wrestling
world, the Man of Steel, Zangief!
And his opponent, one who
has lived a checkered life...
...and has trained with the wildest
animals in the deepest jungle:
Blanka!
Strange... She said she`d be at home.
Oh, shit! IÂ´m in a hurry!
You`re Balrog!
That`s strange! I`ve got a bad
feeling. Answer the phone!
What was that? Chun Li!
One of my hobbies is to slowly skin rabbits.
These want to taste the blood of a pretty bunny.
Spinning Bird Kick!
My... my beautiful face!
You!!! I`m going to kill you!!!
Shit!
Chun Li!
Chun Li! Hang in there!
- It was Balrog.
- What?
Chun Li. Chun Li! Chun Li!
And what about Balrog? By the New York Police?
We were following the monitor cyborgs and
we found one of them around Ken Masters...
... Champion of the US Fighting
Invitational, who`s now living in Seattle.
Yes, I think Vega will approach him because he`s
different from these other nameless street fighters...
...and has much more power.
We`ve heard of a man named Ryu, who
studied with Ken, and are now investigating.
We`ve got some information on a man, traveling
from Thailand to India, who may be Ryu.
All right. Track him down.
I`ll be here at the hospital with
Chun Li for the meanwhile.
I`ll try to fly to Seattle to see Ken
Masters after things stabilize.
Get me a full report on Ken.
Eliza, why don`t we get married?
- Why are you asking that all of a sudden?
- Don`t you want to?
Why wouldn`t I? It`s you who
hasn`t said much about it.
Then it`s okay, right?
- But...
- But what?
I`m still uncomfortable with the idea.
- Did anything happen?
- No, nothing.
Ken!
Ken, you`re acting kind of strange today.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Let me think it over more.
I love you.
Give me a call later.
Ryu, I`m tired of waiting for you.
- Commander, the car is in our sights.
- Good, move in.
Shit.
What`s that?
You`re Ken Masters, correct? I`ve come for you.
You`ve come for me? Who are you?
I`m the Commander-in-Chief of Shadowloo, Vega.
- Vega? I don`t know you. What do you want?
- I`m going to make you into a warrior of warriors.
You`re a fucking madman! Go away!
I`m going to make you a far better fighter than Ryu.
Ryu? What do you know of him?
- Oh, the mention of Ryu has gotten your attention.
- Shut up! It`s none of your business!
You monster! What are you trying to do to me?
What a strange technique!
It`s no use trying to resist my Psycho-Power.
Psycho-Power?
-Ken, don`t resist... Obey me!
- Shut up!
Ken, obey me!
- Who can obey such a monster?
- You don`t understand, do you?
Hadouken!
(Wave Motion Fist)
He`s quite a fighter. I look forward to training him.
Why do you want to see Ken Masters?
Ken has been targeted by Vega.
- Is this Ken`s car?
- Yes, I`m positive.
Shit! We were a little too late.
This shows the locations of each of the Shadowloo
bases throughout the world and the areas where...
...we`ve found monitor cyborgs. We haven`t found anything in Seattle except a warehouse full of weapons and drugs.
If Ken was taken by Vega, he must be
where all the other fighters are trained.
Do you have any information on any such areas?
We haven`t located their training base yet...
...but Shadowloo`s central command
bases are concentrated in Southeast Asia.
Lt. Commander Guile, we`ve received information
on the location of Ryu, Ken`s fellow student.
The fighter that was in India? Where?
He seems to be in some mountain
region of Thailand...
...near the border of Laos.
Are there any monitor cyborgs
deployed around him?
Yes, we`ve caught some, but Ryu has
been moving around here and there,...
...from China to India to Thailand, and he doesn`t
seem to be moving...
...in any particular direction, so the monitor
cyborgs may not be able to pinpoint him.
According to the report, Ryu may be as powerful
as Ken. Vega must have targeted him already.
All right, we`ll get to him before Vega does and
catch Shadowloo when they try to get him.
By the way, have Interpol and the U.S. military
completed the Shadowloo destruction plans yet?
We`ve already found most of
Shadowloo`s command bases.
First of all, we`ve planned out...
...a clustered attack mission against
their bases on the border of Cambodia.
Chun Li...
...we`ve finally found Vega`s headquarters.
I`ll take revenge for you and
your father with my bare hands.
I know you wanted to take
Vega`s life yourself...
... but leave everything to me
this time and just get well.
I`m leaving now.
Ken, the source of your fighting power comes from
your memories of your sparring with Ryu, right?
Superb. Let me boost your memories
of your rivalry with my Psycho-Power.
Ryu, are you alright?
Yeah, I`m ok.
Thank you. Okay, you want to go another round?
Lt. Commander Guile, we`ll be approaching
the mountain area on the Laos border soon.
Understood.
Lord Vega, we`ve just received information
from Thailand of an army helicopter...
...carrying Guile, heading towards the Laos border.
It appears that he`s going for Ryu.
He`s trying to get there before me. Interesting.
- I`m taking Ken with me and heading there as well.
- But Ken`s not ready yet...
I don`t care. I`ll just let both fighters have their...
...fated battle with each other.
- I plan to return with Ryu. Get everything ready!
- Yes, sir!
Lord Vega... Please let me fight Ryu.
You`re critical to Shadowloo. Forget
the bitter memories of that fight.
I can`t. If I don`t fight Ryu again, my honor will be...
The honor of a fighter... it`s incomprehensible.
Your opponent is now the world.
But...
Sagat! No one disobeys my orders or the rules
of Shadowloo. You must understand this!
I have another job for you. Fly to New
York right away and deal with...
...Balrog and Cammy. Shadowloo
does not permite failure.
Hey, Ryu! Why don`t you
take a break for some tea?
It looks like bad weather.
What`s that?
Hey, Ryu, we`ve got guests at this mountain retreat.
- You`re Ryu, a friend of Ken Masters, right?
- Yes, I am. Who are you?
I`m Guile of the U.S. Air Force.
What`s happened to Ken?
He`s been abducted by the
criminal organization, Shadowloo.
- Ken`s been taken by Shadowloo?!
- He`s to be used as a terrorist.
- Ken can`t be involved with any criminal organization.
- His mind is being controlled.
They can turn him into a terrorist?
- That`s Vega`s VTOL.
- What?
We seem to have a lot of guests today!
Wow, that`s a lot of dust!
Ken!
You`ve finally come, Vega!
Guile, I haven`t seen you in a long time.
Now all the professionals are on deck.
You bastard! What do you plan to do to Ken?
Are you Ryu?
Ken has joined Shadowloo to become
a warrior for us instead of you.
You shithead! Set him free!
Ryu!
Ken... Ken!
What about him? He`s now
a killing machine I created.
Can you beat him?
Ken! It`s me, Ryu!
Unfourtunately, he can`t seem to hear the voice
of his best friend. He`s just a machine here to kill you.
Ken, come to your senses!
Vega, I can`t allow you to control anyone anymore.
A spirit of righteousness within you... But you see, Guile,
it`s the spirit of corruption that is the source of all power.
Ken`s here to prove that.
I`m tired of all this talking!
Let`s kick his ass! Let`s go!
- Who are you? - I`m the one
who`s going to deal with you!
Why don`t you see whether or not
you can beat me?
I look forward to it.
Ken, it`s me! Snap out of it!
Ken!
It`s me! It`s Ryu! Wake up, please! Ken!
What are you doing? You want revenge
for your friend`s death, correct? Hit me!
I won`t be beaten twice!
Sonic Boom!
That`s two you lose!
Oh, my God!
Wait! Our fight isn`t over yet...
Ken, wake up! I don`t want to
fight you like this! Wake up, please!
Ken!
Ken, it`s me! It`s Ryu! Look at me!
- Ryu...
- Ken.
Useless!
Stop it!!
Ken!
Move it!
Do you want to fight with me? Interesting.
I`m going to test your fighting ability.
Shut up! Get out of my way!
No more talk! You can go to your
friend after you have beaten me up.
Out of my way!!
I`m leaving.
Okay, take care. I`ll be leaving
this mountain in a couple of days.
- Until we meet...
- When I see you again...
I`m looking forward to it.
Damn you...!
Ryu, obey me and become a fighter
for Shadowloo!
- Stop spewing that bullshit! Who would want to be your
puppet?! - Oh, so you still have enough power to resist me?
- What an incredible fighter!
- Shut up!
Fool!
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, though I hate to leave.
When you have the opportunity
to face an opponent...
...you must defeat him beyond the battle.
Strict training will prepare you for that time.
Beyond the battle...
Master, what does "beyond the battle" mean?
Master!
I can teach you.
What?! What`s happened? I can`t remember.
What`s wrong with my body?
Let`s move.
That`s...
I see, that`s the plane the monster was in.
I remember.
Ryu!
It`s him!
Vega!!!
Ryu!!
Shit!
Excelling in the human way to
lead to chi, creating an aura.
Reaching extreme strength to reach resiliance.
Resiliance creating strength in the end.
Ken, what do you see in front of your fist?
Ken! Awake!
Ryu!
What`s wrong? Put more power into it!
- K... Ken!
- Ryu, we meet again.
The greetings can wait.
Let`s kick this monster`s ass first!
Both of you are eager to fight me, aren`t you? Excellent.
I`m going to take you on as a fighter. Come on!
You`re as good as I expected. You hit me.
What`s wrong? More! Attack me with more!
Attack me with more!
Look how strong he is! He`s
shaken me up for a moment.
Vega!
Ken! This is it!
Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku!
(Whirlwind kick!)
Shoryuken!
(Rising Dragon Punch)
Get ready!
Hadouken!
(Wave Motion Fist!)
- Is this Guile?
- Yes.
This is New York Central Hospital.
Please come to the hospital at once.
Chun Li...
You bastard! Watch where you`re driving!
Chun li!
Chun Li...
I took revenge on Vega as I promised.
I know.
Interpol and the US Military`s Shadowloo
Destruction Plan was a success.
- Guile, you did it!
- You little...!
- I`m sorry! - You`re not forgiven!
- Sorry!
- Ryu, we`ll settle things with each
other the next time we meet. - Yeah.
- Do you want a ride?
- No, I`m going to walk.
- Where are you headed?
- I don`t know.
- Ryu, you`ve gotten stronger.
- You too.
See you.
