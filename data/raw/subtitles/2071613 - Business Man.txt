How dare you kidnap my daughter?
You had destroyed all my dreams
Sir everyone has different dreams,

That's why peaceful world dream remains

Dream about yourself or about your daughter!
Poor girl must be crying there sir!
You and l don't like if she cries Sir.
Sir please listen to me, don't make this
a big issue, Yes sir don't make it a big.
Your dad is a good person!
He freed me.
Are you a human?
Do you have any humanity?
Do you have any morals?
We all watch discovery channel,
One tiger chase a deer..
by seeing the visuals everyone prays
god that the deer should escape...
When deer escapes everyone claps with joy
and switch off the TV.
They will butcher the chicken and enjoy it.
they don't have any pity either on deer or chicken.
because they can't do anything to the tiger
that's why they say pity or humanity.
They all are humans,
that's why they talk about humanity...
Come let's go home...
your dad crying to you...
Where will you escape now?
Tell me?
Sir give me permission I will
shoot him here.
lf you shoot me whenever or wherever
what's the difference between us.
Are you all humans?
Don't you have any morals

Why we have to pity you?

Who is Bharath here? I am!

Sir let me ask you one thing
in front of your force..
l loved your daughter for real.
l will do anything for her!
Will you marry her to me?
l will stop everything.
That's not possible.
Then you won't do anything for your dream?
Chitra! Do you want me or not?
l hate you.
Say it again!
That means I can do my work?
You don't have any objection?
Sir I am telling you that l will make
mafia legal.
....neither you are you system can
touch me.
Then l will come and take your daughter,
if you like it or not.
Hey girl get lost!
When I propose why are you denying
it? Get lost..
How can you leave me when I am carzy
about you?
Am I not a good person?
Or you did not liked me?
Why don't you look at me once,
What's the reason for the anger on me
You got me with your looks
...you caught me with your beauty.
Your smile has intoxicated me.
You have slept in my heart
You stole my heart without my
knowledge.
l admire you a lot.
Hey! girl why did l go crazy on you?
lf you break my heart never come
back again.
With your beauty you smashed me,
You made me go around you.
With you walking style you bowled me.
You sneaked into my blanket as a bug
and spoiled my sleep.
Why did you come into my life?
Now you're the path of my life.
We couldn't do anything to him!
Police couldn't do anything either..
He is outside,
Should I stand in the elections or not?
You have to stand only, take as much
money as you want buy all the votes in Mumbai.
You have to be the Mayor of Mumbai again.
Understand?
We have no money,
How?
Within two days elections are held
what should we do now?
Where do they get money from?
From Delhi! When? Tomorrow.
Who is getting money? Mayor has ten of his people
they will get it and they distribute accordingly.
Before they distribute they will be
raided by lncome Tax officials.
Today con artist have robbed business men
by faking as lT officials.
Since it's all black money none of them
lodged any compliant, it's about 100 to 200 crores.
He is the one who did this!
He gets all criminals ideas like this.
Our fate!
He is a big hero in Dharavi...
lf Lalu becomes Mayor then we can't
touch him.
Why didn't you inform me? They had snatched
our mobiles and locked us, They took our money too.
By looking at them you can tell
if they are originals or fake people!
How can we judge sir one fellow kept his
gun on the table..
l thought lT officials had also given guns.
l lost my pride, being in power l couldn't
make my men win as a Mayor.
lf I keep quite like this, then his name
will become famous in Mumbai.
Slowly l will lose control on Mumbai,
l have to stop him..
You are doing a big mistake!
When he used you, You loved him.
...but now he loves you,
but you are avoiding him.
What that is love?
l can understand it but you're unable to...
Teach her wisely, if she understand this
why would l face all this.
Who will love people who kills others.
They don't know the valve of life..
Humans! Life! I don' the value of it,
What are you eating?
There are 600 crores humans in this world
daily half of them catch fish and eat.
they call it with different names.
Since you all kill millions offish daily
and eat them it's not an issue..
but if accidently a shark eats a man you
guys creates a big issue out of it.
lf a small shark bites a boy at the beach
you guys telecast in all channels.
You guys make movies out this issues
Jaws 1 ,2,3,....
What yours are life not there's?
All rubbish....
Lot of people are trying to kill me
what about them?
lf there is another life I would not
reborn as a human, They are killing here.
This is my last life,
you won't get me. come.
stay with me!
How can l stay if you kill people daily?
Why are you doing all this?
Often terrorist plant bombs to show their identity.
Sometimes Lord Vinayaka drinks milk
to tell that l exist.
lf Lord Vinayaka drinks milk daily
no one would feed him...
To make people scare sometimes we've to kill
or drink milk.
Kill me and drink my blood too....
Don't go like that...
lf you leave me l will become more dangerous,
Go ahead, l don't care.
You and your dad go to hell.
We have to expand our business.
Head office is here in Mumbai.
We need branches all over India.
We need offices in all the cities and towns.
l need 50 members in each branch as my staff.
Do you know who is our staff?
The local goondas.
These local goonds are with local politicians
but they don't get paid monthly.
..but we pay them monthly..
Why 50 people?
How 50 men walk together!
Just imagine how 50 people chases
with the guns in their hands.
To make a city in control we need
-50 people.
All the settlements in the city has to be done in
our local offices.
Where do you get the money and how
will you pay them salaries?
They will earn themselves.
No matter what business they do
they have to pay 2%. as commission.
person who makes 1 lakh paying 2000/-
as a commission is not a big deal.
We will support them and solve
there problems if any!
Small people will give but what about big
people would they agree? They have to....
threaten all businessmen by showing
our guns.
Our guns should be there in all offices
in India.
they have to pay us...
No matter whatever they do.
Surya tax should be part of sales and service taxes.
Whoever gets any problem they have to come to us
and we have to solve them.
Be friendly with public,
All the bad people must fear by my name.
Surya Bhai is not me!

people in your department will talk bad about you?
Public will not like officers who are strict sir.

Crime rate have gone down.
lf you want you can check your records!
People do crime if they are hungry!

Do you think your salary is enough?
Police who protect our country don't get paid

There are many tempting states...
Why you tell me Chandigadh and
Chatisghad expenses?

We don't want a honest husband
like Lord Rama...
We want a naughty husband like
Lord Krishna.
We need a husband who makes us
go crazy.
We don't want a husband who makes us
follow the routine of a wife.
We want a husband who lets us wear a bikini
and leaves us in the beach.
He should not ask us to cook instead he
should take us to lmax and the pubs
We don't want a husband who orders us to
do things though he is a good man.
We don't want a Veg rather
we want a Non-Veg husband.
We don't want a husband who work
long hours but
we want a husband who spends
long hours in the bedroom.
We don't want him to praise us as a goddess
instead he should praise us and fall on us.
Where is your father? Why did you come?
Where is he? What are you doing to him?
Don't leave Jaydev!
After Gokule's death no one can touch me!
lf I kill Surya before election,

At the age of 14 I cried more

He came with all his wealth to
do something for his Village!
He met a local leader there.
His name is Javdev!
He said he will start a trust and took all
the money and killed my parents!
He stabbed them to death!
l begged police immensely!
No one bothered about it.
No God has come to my rescue.
Don't you understand?
Why are you crying here?
l thought why did my parents
have come here!
l became an orphan.
l had no food to eat, everyone would kick me
like a dog while sleeping on the streets!
l got fed up with the system
of this country and people!
l became alone!
...100 crores are one side
and I am alone on the other side!
l wanted to play with those 100 crores!
That's why l read about people and
selfishness!
lf I feel like stabbing someone
l would do it.
lf someone tries to do injustice
punish him highway!
l can't see him..
...but I wanted to take revenge on the God too...
l don't like your candidates specially that
Raipur guy is waste fellow and Mehaboob Nagar
Write...
Give me a pen!
How can we invest on these candidates
who doesn't have character? Change them.
For each settlements I need 100 crores
in one months' time I need 100 settlements!
Open all the pending case...
..if they don't approach you!
you go to them..
Collect whatever you can, we don't need much

Porbandar opponent candidate is very powerful!
Talk to Surya and make him not to
contest in election
Do you know that if politician has a second
setup he cannot contest in the election?
Jaydev has a second setup and she
has a child!
...talk to her and tell her
that we would give half of Jaydev's property.
Make the DNA test and call the press!
Yes Jaydev is my husband, we got married
-5 years back and we have a 3 year old boy.
Here is the DNA certificate.
Jaidav lost eligibility to be a politician
because of DNA test...
Elections are in a week, I spent 120 crores,
How could you remove me now,
What do you want me to do,
we will lose party prestige because of you
government is filled with scandals,
it is filled with second setups...
not only Jaidev, everyone in that party has
illegal wives and illegal children...
what is this, are they making the country
bigger or their family bigger...
there are 75 news reporters,
give every news reporter a car as a gift...
every newspaper and every news channel
should talk nicely about us...
most of the people are favoring the new party,
since they are fed with the old ones..
we should also take control
of exit poll survey
l need programs that bring
fever to the party...
Ana will win and
we will rule...
Rama rajyam is coming back...
if we give money five days before they will get drunk
and forget, so given money the night before...
we will make sure that Goddess Lakshmi
will flow in the air the day before the elections...
everyone say that money is not permanent
only people are permanent...
but here people are dying but
nothing happens to money...
give away the money before
the people die...
there is rigging happening
at Bhuvaneswar, go take care of that...
take care of the elections, l will
be back, do not come behind me...
how come you did not bring any weapons,
l will use the ones that you have...

but good happened to me that day
with that sympathy, I won as an M.L.A

but you do not know what I will do
after l come here...

show me what you can do...
l want to see your range,
l want to see everything about you, show me...
Since you are so eager, what would
stop me...
your history will end today...
you will not exist to speak and
no one will be around to talk about you...
just kill him...
load the gun...
show me Chitra by the time
l finish the balance...
after that I will not even ask you
where Chithra is? I will kill you in the same order...

immediately after taking an oath...
he will be meeting the famous businessman
Vijay Surya in Mumbai...
he worked very hard to develop
Surya Exports and lmports...
the Prime Minister is coming
today to visit him...
what message do you give to youth...
l am saying this because you asked me to
Life is a battle field...
God put all of us in a war zone...
keep a goal in life and do anything
to achieve it...
if you want to sing , sing with focus
if you want to study, study with focus...
the people who have no goal in life
die as fast as you can because there is no use with you.
remember one thing, that there
is no one greater than you...
do whatever you feel like and do not listen to anyone
especially to a human being...
if you target is 10 miles aim for the 1 1th mile..
if you beat someone, they should be blocked!
Don't try to enter into my place
or else l will go crazy.
This is my place
You get lost...
