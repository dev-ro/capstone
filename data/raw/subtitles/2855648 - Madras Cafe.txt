Get them out!
All Tamils get out!
Leave me! Leave us! No! l won't go!
'Breaking news.'
'Sri Lankan president
has been assassinated.'
'The killing was carried
out using a human bomb.'
'According to the Iocal
police this incident took place..'
'..when he was coming out
of CoIombo's Army Headquarters.'
'lt is being alleged that
the LTF could be behind this.'
'After this incident it is possible that
peace attempts wilI get deferred.'
'And the situation there
could get tense again.'
Ruby,
I want to say everything.
The truth..
I cannot carry..
..this burden anymore.
You've been drinking again.
I'Ve told you.
whatever is bothering you,
share it ...
You will feel lighter.
Otherwise, go home.
Betrayal..
Power..
Greed..
Can I talk about such
things before your God?
Yes, You can.
The Iast witness..
They killed him as well.
It was a game.
A conspiracy.
Who are you?
It's been three years since
you've been coming here...
And What's this conspiracy
that you are taIking of?
What wrong did our
Prime Minister do?
Why did we let him die?
What?
We could've saved
our prime minister.
What do you know?
'l was there, Father.'
'lt was the darkest phase
in the history of Sri Lanka.'
'The clashes between the
Iargest ethic group SinhaIese..'
'..and the minority TamiIs..
..had was going through
its worst crisis.'
'This ethic VioIence claimed thousands
of Tamilian civiIian Iives...'
Abuses..
'The suppIy of basic
necessities like food..'
'Water..'
'Everything was stopped.'
'A lot of famiIies were destroyed.'
'And thus thousands of TamiIian
youth turned rebelIious..'
'And joined the LTF leader Anna.'
Long Live Eelam
'Anna refused to surrender
before the Sri Lankan forces.'
'And raised the demand
for a separate TamiI state.'
'And thus began,
the endless kiIIings.'
'These bIoodbath made
many TamiIs lose their homes.'
'And they sought refuge in India.'
'lndian government
expressed its concern..
..and decided to intervene.'
Peace Accord is an important
political decision.
I wilI be going ahead with it.
We wiIl be signing
the Peace Accord tomorrow.
To make sure that no inhumane
activity takes pIace..
..during the Provincial
Council EIections..
..l've decided to send
a peace force to the island.
'Prime Minister signed
the historical Peace Accord..
..with the Sri Lankan
President today.'
'He aIso declared the
ProvinciaI Council EIections..'
'So that once again there is
peace and normalcy in the island.'
'The first group
of the peace force.. '
'..reached there with an intention
of making the rebeIs surrender arms.'
'ln the hope that peace
and normaIcy returns.'
'But Anna rejected
the Peace Accord.'
'19 LTF cadres committed
suicide in Sri Lankan custody.'
'And Anna blamed lndia..
..and Sri Lanka for it.'
'He said that this peace accord
is not in the favor of the TamiIs.'
'He feared that if
they surrendered arms..'
'..then once the
peace force leaves..'
'..alI the TamiIs in
the isIand will be kiIIed.'
'Hence..
'He was not ready to negotiate.'
This is going to be a long war.
'lndian Army Iaunched
an operation to capture Anna.'
'But our soldiers got kiIIed . '
' since Anna was
aIready in the know of..
..our operationaI
detaiIs and inteIs '
'And from here on,
began a gruesome gueriIIa war..'
'..between Anna
and the peace force.'
Our soldiers are getting killed.
Operation detaiIs
are getting leaked.
RD, I hope you are aware
of what your boys are up to.
But we had warned you,
not to send the forces.
But it was your General
who assured the PM..
..that we'II disarm
them in 72 hours.
And here we are, after one year.
If this continues,
we're sure to get embarrassed.
PM needs is answerable
to the people.
Mr. Cabinet Secretary, we are not
fighting with a traditionaI army.
This is a Iocally
entrenched guerilla force.
We just can't make out who's
a miIitant and who's a civilian!
We don't eVen have proper maps!
But yes, if they attack us,
we wiII retaIiate.
This shouIdn't become
another Vietnam for us.
How much more can
we embarrass the PM?
RD?
The fact is,
Anna doesn't trust us anymore.
And Perhaps we ourselves are
responsibIe for creating this situation
If we Ioosen the grip any further..
..it wiII be a goIden opportunity for
the west to get inside the island.
And this is already happening
Guruji all of a sudden
going to Singapore..
..with Murthy for
a spirituaI tour..
Is it a coincidence?
So, Mr. Murthy,
..you wish to be the
Iord of the largest democracy?
I'Ve aIways been saying..
..that there's a conspiracy
to overthrow the government.
One thing is cIear now.
Only military action won't suffice.
All these are cIear cut signs.
OVert operations
won't be enough now.
RD, get aII the covert ops ready.
This Peace Accord needs to succeed,
at any cost.
That's alI. Good luck.
RD..
Stay.
Enough of these discussions.
Media is asking a lot of questions.
You'II have to intervene.
I'm ready..
..to use aII the
inteIIigence at my disposal.
But who are we reaIIy fighting?
You, too, need to understand.
The situation is Very sensitive.
Anna won't surrender arms.
He is adamant.
And others are waiting
to jump in to win his trust.
We wiIl lose the island.
And that will be a serious
national threat for us.
Now is not the time
to go by the book.
The time to question..
..what is Iegitimate
and what is not, is over.
You know very well what
needs to be done with Anna.
Send in your best men.
We need to form a Provincial
Council there, before Diwali.
Swarup, get me Major Vikram.
I want him in Delhi
in the next 24 hours.
Urgent.
Ruby, l need to go.
Otherwise, you know.. - Look,
I know, I am an army wife.
And I need to hold
my head high and aII that.
And I wilI.
But it's been four years.
And I just keep missing you.
How do I stay normaI?
Don't worry.
EVerything wiII be normaI soon.
Oh yes, and avoid aII these news.
And take care of yourseIf.
If you are so concerned
about me then don't go.
Six months, at Ieast..
Till I hold you again, like this.
So, what's happening?
Bala has been informed.
Jaffna safe house
has been activated.
Vikram..
Still as restIess as ever?
Old habits die hard, sir.
Relax.

during the Mizoram operation.
Good memory.
Sir.
Anyway, taIking about work..
Do you know anything

I'Ve done my homework, sir.
You know nothing.
You'II be soleIy responsible for alI
coVert operations of RAW in Jaffna.
Sir.
PM is concerned about
the situation there.
His cIear agenda is to execute
ProvinciaI Elections successfuIIy
The SmalI militant groups
there have surrendered.
But The most powerful group,
the most ferocious one, LTF..
is stiII resistant.
Do we have a strategy, sir?
Step one: Break LTF.
The most Iikely candidate
for that: Mallaya.
He's Anna's Man Friday.
Very IoyaI.
ImpossibIe to reach.
Step Two: Shri.
He's the only man in the
island who can stand against Anna.
Get him on our side.
For officiaI matters you'II report
to the Madras Desk Head, BaIa.
He's tough but knows
a lot about Jaffna.
But you'II report to me personally,
about everything.
keep me in the Ioop. - Yes, sir.
Any questions? - No, sir.
Welcome aboard.
Come, Swaroop.
Jaffna?
But isn't a civiI
war going on there, Vi?
Don't worry.
I'm IeaVing behind
a contact - Swarup's.
Call him in case of any emergency.
'lndian Prime Minister

LTF.
Most dedicated and disciplined.
They operate from deep
within the jungIe, from bunkers..
..40 feet underground.
Hence, this map.
Memorize it.
Relax.
We'II be running our
phase two covert operations.
We need to weaken
LTF's top Ieaders.
Dead or aIive.
LFT. Liberations of TamiIs Front,
aIso known as Tigers.
The top leader: Pandyan,
InteI chief.
Mallaya,
deputy leader and army commander.
Rajsekharan,
their spokesperson, an arms dealer.
But our hero, Anna Baskaran.
He doesn't need an intro.
On the other hand, TPA.
Chief, Shri.
Once upon a time
he was Anna's partner.
He's soft.
Wants to get into politics.
Prime Minister wants that
Anna shouId surrender arms..
..and join the
eIections before Diwali.
Make Shri powerfuI.
Make them fight each other.
Do we this all by ourselves?
Obviously.
You are not in the army anymore.
You are an agent of R&AW.
Hence use Iess brawn
and more brains.
You'II report everything to me.
I'll find out what I
need to through my own means.
I cannot afford mistakes.
Sir.
And most importantIy,
you are a team Ieader.
So don't get caught.
Never get caught.
'My primary task
for the next few days..'
Turn Ieft.
'..was to find Shree.'
We identified a
few important Iinks.
'We got a breakthrough when
Narayanan agreed to meet us.'
Hello, sir.
I got through Narayanan.
He's agreed to meet.
Tomorrow, 7:00am.
7kms from safe house.
Sir, the one in white shirt.
This basket. - How much
does it weigh? - 30 kgs.
And This is for? - Local market..
70% of the earth
is covered with water.
It's not so difficult
to catch fish.
Oh really?
That realIy depends on the fish.
The deeper you go the
better fish you catch.
Tell me, which one do you want?
My bosses Iove the
fish you catch for them.
Which one do you want?
I told you this one belongs
to the locaI market..
Tell me which one do you want?
ClA, KGB, Tigers.
They're AII the same for me.
I don't have time to waste.
Don't even try to negotiate.
Shri
You an agent?
EVeryone is the same in a war zone.
Maybe.
But for me,
no satisfaction means no fish.
You see this Information
business has become too risky...
I'll have to give information
about you if anyone enquires.
I need to store that.
Now you may Leave.
Stop
Go.
How will you and your
government support me?
The situation out here..
How will peopIe sitting
in New DeIhi controI it?
New Delhi recognizes your TPA.
And our PM's agenda
is exactly to settle that.
Election and peace.
Peace?
Anna has made me his archrivaI.
We were Iike brothers.
He's being brutal to our peopIe.
He wants totaI control over Jaffna.
PeopIe want to see one Ieader.
Come to the point.
Sir,
we want you to counter LTF.
We need Ioads of
arms to counter Anna.
Loads of them.
Can your bosses
provide me with arms?
Will they promise?
Can you?
Sir, we'll support you in this war.
We're with you.
Wait, Mr. Vikram.
I hate Iiars.
You won't get a second chance.
Remember that.
You need to reIax, boss.
Shri neither trusts me, nor you.
I'm just waiting
for the right time.
He won't agree on anything
untiI he gets the arms.
Please understand, boss.
Who are you working for?
For Shri? Or for me?
Sir, I'Il handle this my way.
Trust me.
Please, sir.
keep me informed.
Down.. down..
Welcome, madam. This way.
So,
you did meet with
the Prime Minister.
He offered you the support
what you were seeking.
But then you backed off.
My soIdiers surrendered their arms.
They were killed.
I was backstabbed.
I want safety for my peopIe.
What happens when
the peace forces leave?
Look, it's a clear order
for the peace forces..
..to ensure that the
eIections go peacefuIly.
But you're also heII bent
on boycotting these elections.
By teaming up with Shri?
DoubIe standard.
I'm aIready an eIected leader.
I'Ve a legitimate army.
Attention!
So this bIoodbath,
there's no end to it?
I did not start it.
Salute!
Then if you don't agree
for a political solution..
..you'Il have to
find a new partner.
Is there a new aIIiance?
This is my Iand.
ELAM is my final destination.
For that if l need to
seek help from the west..
..then l wiII.
LTF's leader Anna
has once again rejected..
..lndia's offer
for peace eIections.
And has further stated that..
..he will not hesitate
to seek heIp from the west.
How does New Delhi react to this?
How will this affect the
peace process in the island?
Only time will tell.
Rajsekharan,
you source funds
and arms from outside.
Go and meet our new foreign friend.
We need..
..your heIp in our fight,
in our war.
So you need our support?
We need to be assured
of your support in the future.
I have to pass through.
There couId be An ambush ma'am.
Rounds are being fired inside.
I can't alIow you to go in.
Look, l've the
colonel's permission.
I'Ve received no such orders.
- Ma'am..
I have to pass through.
- Captain. l know her.
Not bad. Thank you.
I read your interview.
How's Anna?
Hey, Iisten, he's not my friend.
But I will say this.
I'Ve neVer met anyone with
so much cIarity and purpose.
You can't buy him.
Then Anna must've also
told you about his new partner.
You're asking me?
UntiI Iast year LTF
was faVored by New Delhi.
But now, their riVaI TPA Shri
seems to haVe taken their place.
I don't know what
you're taIking about.
Somebody has got
to be helping them.
Why tell me?
It's yourjob, isn't it?
"The date for arms deaI
was decided as 6th July.
'lt was important that the
arms consignment reached Shri.'
Hello. Capt. Murli.
Delivery wiIl be
made from Singapore.
From here.
By using fishing boats,

And this here,

Point Pedro.
Delivery at 4:00pm.
- 'But l didn't know that..'
'This smaII arms deaI wiII

'..and my Iife forever.'
Gifts are on the

Be sure they reach our new friends.
Don't worry, Reed.
My man wiIl be there

Okay. Over and out.

We did aII we could do.
Sir.
Happy?
We Iost an important man
Out! Get out!
What had l asked you?
"if you can't handIe

Did I or did l not say that?
What now?
A marching party?
Sir, someone doubIe-crossed us.
Don't give me that bullshit!
Vikram, you know what your probIem
is, you think you're too smart!
Sir. Trust me, sir.
LTF was not supposed to be there.
I don't know from where
the random firing started.
Do you know what
be the resuIt of this?
Anna and Shri,
both of them will hunt us down.
Hello? Sir..
What!
RD sir is on the line.
Sure, sir.
I wilI take control.
Yes.
Now you get out of Jaffna.
Go straight to the
Colombo safe house.
And stay there.
Delhi stilI hasn't
aItered its ways.
The same old strategy.
It's not so.
We want to support you.
You gaVe such a big
arms consignment to LTF.
This is how you'll support us!
There was an ambush.
I too Iost a man.
The other guy, Vikram,
he came here and made big promises.
Do you know why he is still aIive?
I told my men that he's your man.
It was a mistake
Bullshit,
This is how l'II counter Anna?
I'll handIe him personalIy.
24 hours.
DeaI with him.
If you don't then I will.
He's gone to Capt. MurIi's shop.
What happened at the jetty?
I don't know.
Who informed LTF?
I don't know. I reaIIy don't know.
No one knew about the arms deal.
How did they find out about it?
I don't know, pIease, sir.
For God's sake.
I don't know, sir.
Right, sir.
keep him aIiVe..
don't kilI him
Jaya, the journaIist's
room number pIease.
403.
Jaya.
Jaya, it's me.
I need to talk to you.
Anna wouId get the arms.
You knew about it, didn't you?
Is this an official
interrogation, Mr. RAW?
Because if it is, my answer is no.
How did you know?
I need to know.
Excuse me?
Why are you asking me this?
I have my networks.
That's my job.
You shouId know how it works.
Jaya, please.
if Anna is being made more powerful
There wilI be repercussions.
The entire peace process will fail.
There wilI be a whoIe new civiI war.
Goddamn it. This is not a game.
Vikram, look around.
The peace process
has aIready faiIed.
And I'm not pIaying games either.
I'm here because there
human lives are at stake.
Jaya, please.
What do you know?
Look, before I came here
I got a caII from my source.
A foreign agency guy
met with an Indian officiaI.
And the Ieak happened in Bangkok
Was that Indian official from RAW?
I don't know.
Look, if he was Raw then you know..
Let me teII you,
they know your next move
much before you even implement it.
So you should know about it,
not me.
Vikram,
this conversation never happened.
Assets can't caIl be called back.
Specially considering..
Sir, there's some urgent news.
Please have a Iook at it.
'Latest news has just come in from
Sri Lanka that an Indian national..'
'..Vikram Singh has been
abducted by the LTF miIitants..'
'..in the Jaffna area.'
Stay down, stay down..
'The lndian High Commission
in CoIombo has stated..'
'..they are not aware
of the whereabouts of Vikram.'
This kidnapping is assumed
to be a poIiticaI kidnapping.
How unstable will
the conditions be?
Or WiIl the lndian High...
Get me BaIa now.
Ma'am, we understand
this is not easy for you.
But this is a poIiticaI kidnapping.
We are negotiating.
But we can approach the
Indian High Commission, right?
They can send in the army.
After all the army
is responsible, right?
Vikram was on official duty.
He was on official posting.
Ma'am, we need to understand
whom we are dealing with.
A dangerous and brutal
terrorist outfit, LTF.
Perhaps even you know about them.
So you mean I shouId keep mum..
..and my husband's Iife
hangs in the bargain. Right?
Ma'am, we understand your emotions.
But Vikram beIongs to us.
We wiIl try our best
and bring him back safeIy.
Hello. - What the
hell is happening, Bala?
I don't know, sir. I just
returned to Madras this morning.
Our best boy gets kidnapped
right from under your nose..
And you're say that you don't know!
I understand, sir.
You are responsible
for whatever happens there.
I had warned Vikram.
I told him to be careful.
And now LTF is angry..
If LTF is responsibIe
then talk to them.
DepIoy the army if you have to.
Do what you have to but
we want our boy back safely.
Sir, I spoke to the
High Commission in CoIombo.
You know they won't negotiate.
Fine, sir. I'Il leave right away.
I'll leaVe for the
army base camp right away.
Soldier's name: Vikram Singh.
Suspected Iocation: PalIai town.
48kms east from Jaffna.
Bravo one.
Around 50 LTF holding up there.
Ask LTF to leave right now..
I have depIoyed the army.
Target Visible. 60 degrees north.
Sir, He's aIiVe.
Bravo one to base camp.
Location is empty.
Repeat. Location is empty.
Status: Injured but aIiVe.
Here have this you'II feeI better.
How do you feeI?
Look at your seIf
Your New Delhi thinks
that it can sit there..
..and manage everything
through a remote controI.
Nonsense!
In the fieId, in the jungle..
I'm in control here.
Jaffna is my territory.
You wouIdn't have survived.
I saved you.
What next?
Oh, your work is done.
Your assignment's finished.
Your cover is bIown.
You are on the hit-Iist
of both the camps.
You'II put the agency
in risk if you stay here.
So, you should Ieave.
Enjoy with your wife.
Go on a holiday.
And one more thing, your journalist
friend she shouId leave too.
It's not safe for her here.
SP. Here
Will you help me?
Yes, boss?
Henceforth l want aII the information
of BaIa's movements and caII records.
Okay, boss.
How are you?
I'm fine.
And your injury?
'Ruby. The one whom
I always left back alone.'
'She just had only this one hope.'
'That everything wiII be fine.'
'l might haVe been the one at war,
but she too was fighting a battle.'
'With herself.'
'With her fears.'
'l had the entire army with me.'
But aII she had was her belief..'
'That l wiII come back.'
'Alive.'
How are you?
Alive, for now.
You wouIdn't have
survived this time.
LTF was very rigid.
And New Delhi,
you know them weII.
Somehow we managed.
But, sir, I got framed.
Twice.
Somehow survived.
So,
what went wrong?
What do you think?
Sir, I was not wrong
about the arms deaI.
There is a Ieak amongst us.
So what's your plan?
Thank you, sir.
That l need to figure out.
But before that,
I'll get you MaIIaya.
You were right.
To pin down Anna,
we need to crack MaIIaya.
How?
You can't go back in the jungIe.
They'Il kiII you.
Sir, with your permission,
Iet me do it.
Off the record.
You mean no vacation?
I want MaIIaya.
Mallaya is the
most dangerous shark.
You're taking a big risk.
You'II get both of us kiIIed.
Fine, l'll see what I can do.
DoubIe money.
Mallaya was Anna's
second in command
Who controlled the
entire east region
And getting him onto
our side for the elections...
...meant breking the ITF into 2
I want to meet Mallaya.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
I'm a reporter.
Why do you want to meet MaIIaya?
I'm reporting on the war.
MyseIf Vikram, sir.
So you..
..want to interview me?
Yes.
I was waiting for you.
You know why?
For what purpose would
a RAW's journalist..
..out his Iife at
risk and come here?
Mr. Mallaya,
Iet me get straight to the point.
My senior wants to meet you.
In CoIombo.
RD is coming to CoIombo?
You know Anna wiII be very angry.
He wants to meet you, aIone.
First you spoke about
breaking the LTF.
Then you prepared TPA against them.
Now you want us to
support the LTF again?
I think we shouId go ahead with
the ProVincial Council EIections.
Pick any three representatiVes.
Go ahead with the
eIections and end this.
"Any" meaning?
The ones no one knows about?
No one recognizes?
If we want peace...
we need the people with us.
And we aII know that
peopIe support LTF.
We wiIl have to partner LTF.
And I don't mean Anna.
We partner LTF without Anna.
We haVe been able to penetrate
to his second in command, MaIlaya.
He has enough backing of
LTF that he can stand on his own.
As a Ieader.
- Now who the hell is MaIIaya, RD?
Hold on.
If we can still haVe
the eIections then..
..we might find a face saving exit.
Otherwise, in the next 48
hours the PM will have to resign.
Sir.
Try.
So...You went passed me?
Good
You met Mallaya.
How did you manage that?
I was just following orders, sir.
Oh, come on!
Don't give me that bullshit.
Conspiring with New DeIhi,
that's what you are doing.
There is a Ieak in my team..
You.
We both are working
for the same government.
You cannot keep implicating me.
If you do that again,
I wilI not hold back.
And you know,
no one is innocent here.
Hi, Jaya.
Hi.
So you're Ieaving?
Obviously.
They think l work for you now.
But thanks for saving my Iife.
Look, l'm sorry that
because of me.. - PIease.
Don't drag me into
this any further.
As a war correspondent it's important
that I'd be seen as unbiased.
It couId ruin everything
that I stand for.
I just wanted you to know
that you are not safe here.
Yeah, l know.
These threats.
Anyway, don't worry.
I promise to remain anti-national.
My office numbers and
my London's personal number.
And, Vikram, be safe.
You too.
Please have your tea.
I don't enjoy such things.
I stay in the jungle.
That's why Anna
operates Iike a tyrant?
He's openIy into brutality.
But it won't last for long.
No matter where Anna is hiding
in this island, we wiII find him.
And the eIections
will be heId peacefuIIy.
But what after that?
Who will be the new leader?
Have you ever giVen that a thought?
It was a mistake coming here.
The mistake is that you
guys are addicted to war.
hanging cyanide capsules
around the neck of smaII children,
making them into turn miIitants...
Is this your war?
You are snatching
away their future.
The TamiIians can
get their rights back..
..onIy through
a poIiticaI solution.
And you can do so,
by being their Ieader.
Not through war.
Our offer is clear.
And what if I refuse?
You haVe no option.
Enjoy your tea.
Vikram, phase three.
Get Anna. - Sir.
Mallaya wiII give
you Anna's location.
Brief the army speciaI forces.
We want Anna at any cost.
Right, sir.
Mission Extract Anna.
Two platoons.
One will Iand in the
east and the other in north.
Vikram..
This is the position
of the LTF camp.
500 meters in diameter.
The whole region is
coVered with landmines.
This will be our dropping point.
Pottai lake.
Remember,
we have onIy eight minutes.
Vikram, your job in Jaffna
is over for the time being.
ImmediateIy station
yourself in KeraIa.
Wait for further orders. Leave now.
He's not here.. its empty
Target locked.
Cover up! Cover up!
Come on!
Fast...
Anna.. southern side..
in the bunker.. this way.
'l surviVed.'
'l came back to lndia.'
'But my job was stiII incompIete.'
'BaIa. l knew he was the Ieak.'
But I needed concrete evidence.
What happened, Vikram?
Those faces,
those killings..
Something doesn't seem right, Ruby.
Just Iet go.
'As per the latest news
received LTF leader Anna is dead.'
'The news of Anna's death
spread like wild fire.'
'The whoIe isIand was in shock.'
'The whoIe worId beIieved us.'
'And we too,
believed that our job was done.'
Long IiVe Mallaya!
Our Ieader MaIIaya.
'MaIIaya declared himseIf
as the new leader of LTF.'
'But..'
'Anna was alive.'
Why did you do this?
No one can betray our ELAM.
'And now,
it was impossibIe to stop Anna.'
'He became the undisputed
Ieader of North-East Sri Lanka.'
'And now much more ferocious.'
'Prime Minister
has resigned today.'
'Due to an unexpected
deVeIopment this morning..'
'..he took this step
under poIiticaI pressure.'
'Because of the change
in the poIiticaI scenario...
...in Delhi, PM resigned.'
'A week after the new
government came into power..'
'..our army was calIed
back from Lanka.'
'This was a Victory for Anna,'
'against the world's fourth
Iargest miIitary force.'
From here on began
the grand conspiracy.
The final assassination pIot.
So, is this the reason
why we lost our Prime Minister?
Fresh elections were announced
a year after his resignation.
'During the eIection campaign,'
'at a press conference..'
'..ex-prime minister...'
'..announced his poIiticaI
agenda for the next elections.'
TamiI cause be an important
issue for you this time as weII?
If we do come into power,
apart from economic growth..
..TamiI cause wiIl be
an important issue for me.
That there is Peace in the island.
That the TamiIians
shouId get their rights.
This is what we wilI aim for.
'Peace in the isIand.'
'TamiIians should
get their rights.'
'This is what we wiII aim for.'
'My stand is cIear. I want
a peacefuI political solution.'
'A month after this speech,
'our Madras Desk and
South-East Naval force..'
'..intercepted
some coded messages.'
Reed, the meeting is fixed.
'And perhaps from here on that the
grand conspiracy began took shape.'
Guruji...
We need to act and
this is the perfect time.
You fix up the meeting.
You just wait there.
I'll teII you what. Okay.
SpeakYa...
What is it?
Sir, these are the
Intercepts of last few days.
I'Ve collected some
from the NaVaI inteIIigence.
Sir, since From the past few
days this the wireless chatter..
..between London, Jaffna and Singapore
has seems to have increased, sir.
Yes, it's okay.
It's routine. You may leave.
No, sir. One of the speakers
voices is that of Anna's.
Look, l'lI see Iook into what's
important or what's not, in it.
But doesn't this sound
seem quite serious?
Go. Leave.
Listen, you're doing a good job.
keep me in the Ioop.
Okay, sir.
Hello? HeIIo?
Vikram's residence, sir.
The fiIe is missing.
Sir, spooI..
Bloody heII..
They are both in Cochin.
Send your men there.
Hello?
Hello, Ruby?
Where are you, Vikram?
Why? - These pictures
and articIes..
Something is just not right.
Whom do you work for?
Listen, don't worry.
I'm coming home.
Don't open the door for anyone.
Okay?
Ruby!
Ruby..
Whom do you work for?
We aren't safe here.
In your absence our house is
under surveillance in your absence.
We're shifting to Delhi.
- l'm being shadowed.
Trust me, we have to move on.
That's not the answer, Vikram.
These pictures, these kilIings, these
articIes, the foreign journalist..
This is not army.
You killed ciViIians?
These kilIings are
political kiIIings.
Jaya, she is a foreign journalist.
Trust me, this is a setup.
I can expIain this.. - You jerk.
All these days, you Iied to me.
Ruby, l do covert operations.
I monitor political and miIitary
deVeIopments of different countries.
This country's security
is my responsibility.
We haVe been married for three years.
I know there is a responsibility.
But there is a protocol.
But I am not a..
I don't care about your protocol,
aIright!
I'm your wife, damn it!
I have a right to know.
What about me..
How do I deal with aIl this?
Sri Lanka..
Your Iife was constantly
under threat there.
Do you have any
idea how I survived?
And today l got petrified, Vikram.
- Sweetheart..
Just Ieave me aIone.
Ru..
Ruby..
Hello? - Boss, SP.
I'm in Cochin.
We shouId need to meet.
It's urgent.
Right away? - Sorry, sir.
I don't have much time.
We'II talk when we meet.
At seven. Beach café.
Okay.
Ruby.. - I know you have to go.
Just go.
Hello, boss.
Something reaIIy seems
to be out of order in Madras.
A lot of intercepts and wireless
messages are being exchanged.
From Jaffna to London.
Madras, Singapore.
And One of the Voices
is that of speakers is Anna's.
I'Ve decoded some keywords.
Like - Foreign friend.
Negotiate. Middle-east.
Does Bala know?
Yes, I'Ve shared them with him.
But he asked me not
to fiIe or decode them.
And His behavior has
really scared me, boss.
I feeI you are
not safe here either.
What should I do next?
Just stay safe.
I'll see what I can do.
Ruby..
Ruby! Ruby!
Ruby!
Why her?
Why?
Vikram..
I'm sorry.
Your Ioss..
What should I say?
Tough times.
You know my wife and
my children keep asking me:
"Why do you do this?"
"There's a lot of danger.
Your Life's always at risk."
How do I explain to them that our
country is surrounded by vultures?
We need to protect it....
How much wilI they understand?
That's why l don't say anything.
Vikram, you need to bounce back.
Anyway, you are not safe here.
I'm not safe anywhere, sir.
You cannot give up
on the system so soon!
System!
We Which we know it inside out!
I need you.
We've got your intercepts.
They are being decoded.
And what you've said about Bala
I hope you are right about BaIa.
God forbid if you are wrong,
you'II be in great risk.
It's a big accusation.
I know, sir.
I need to sort this out.
If you don't start begin
surveiIlance in the next 24 hours..
..then l'lI get
the evidence myself.
And I'll do it my way.
Sir.
We've got a fix on Vasu's location.
He's constantIy shifting his base.
And But his last caII
was traced to oId DeIhi.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Get down! Get down! - Get down!
Bala recruited you for the agency
from the Jammu district jail.
Information was leaked
from our system.
They knew our operational details.
What do you know?
You'II have to speak up, Vasu.
You know the consequences.
I just photocopied the fiIes.
For whom?
I don't know.
My job was to drop
them to at the airport.
Bala sir's instructions.
And Shree's Shri's arms deaI?
We Iost a our man.
You were there as weIl.
Reverse the car
Who informed the LTF?
You? - l've toId you.
I just followed instructions.
What happened that night?
What happened on the night
SP brought the intercepts, Vasu?
That was the first time
I saw Bala sir getting panicked.
'The file is missing!'
He heId me by my coIlar.
He was very nervous.
Why?
Don't worry.
Those intercepts are with me.'
Your department is moving aIong..
A few of his
intercepts were stoIen.
He doubted suspected SP.
So he asked me to tail SP.
And?
He got a call from Singapore.
From? - Some Reed.
'You just make sure those
intercepts do not reach anyone.'
I'Ve neVer seen him.
He used to caII.
'A foreign agency guy
met with an Indian officiaI.'
Did Bala know what did
those intercepts contain?
No.
Those intercepts weren't decoded.
Where is SP now?
I don't know.
Who sent you to DeIhi?
Bala sir asked me to...
..disappear from Madras
safe house after your incident.
And Who gave the orders...
...to kill me and SP?
Vasu..
WhiIe folIowing orders
from Bala did you ever realize..
..that you'Il be such
a disgrace for the system?
Such a shame.
Hello? Yes, you want to speak to?
Jaya Sahni, please.
Jaya Sahni?
And you're caIIing from? - India.
One moment pIease.
I understand, ma.
Don't worry. I'm fine.
I'll caIl you back.
Call from India.
Hello? - Hi, Jaya.
Hi.
How are you?
Jaya, l need your heIp.
I told you, Vikram.
I won't be abIe to help you.
I can't give you my sources.
All our intels have been Ieaked..
To this guy caIIed Reed.
So, it was one of your guys.
- Yes.
And he is a nationaI threat.
So what do you want from me?
I need evidence.
That's why, I need your sources.
Okay.
I'll caIl you back.
Thanks, Jaya.
And, Vikram, I'm reaIly,
really sorry about your wife.
Thank you.
Reed, you your man
Bala is a risk for us.
His coVer is blown
and he's being tracked.
You want me to lose him? - Yes.
Right.
'Okay, Vikram. Reach Bangkok.'
'Take Taxi No. 5892.'
'He will take you to
Happyland fish market.'
'Ask for Shop No. 29.'
'My source wiII meet you there.'
This way to shop no. 29 - That way
So you are Vikram?
And You need evidence?
Yes.
You are in the right direction.
According to my source there
is a tape and we'll get it by five.
Since when have you
been tracking Bala?
Before and after l retired
a lot of actiVity took place..
..between Madras,
Jaffna and Singapore.
I did some surveillance.
I reported it as well.
But I didn't have
concrete evidence.
When l found out that
you're investigating the case,
I agreed to meet you.
Vikram, you are
very cIose to reaIity.
Who is Reed? - l don't know.
It couId be anyone.
Maybe a faceless handler.
Apart from there this...
...a lot of other activities took
place that too raise arouse suspicion.
Look at this.
Rajsekharan at Madras Café!
Yes. The meeting
took place in Singapore.
Two meetings took place there.
In the second meeting
Rajsekharan was introduced.
He was representing Anna.
'So you need our support?'
It means that deVelopments of...
...that meeting changed
the whole politics.
Yes. Do you remember
the date of arms deaI?
6th July. I was there.
This meeting took pIace
on the second2nd July.
ExactIy four days
before the arms deaI.
'Gifts are on the
way from Singapore.'
'Be sure they reach
our new friends.'
'Don't worry, Reed.
My man wiIl be there.'
That's why the arms which
were meant to go to Shree..
..and after those instructions,
went to Anna.
Right.
'Hey hurry up, common..
And perhaps Anna
found a new partner.
Who are these peopIe?
Corporations,
big countries, big organizations.
Who seek They need
economic control,
business deals,
Iarge arms contracts..
And Their executors
are ex-agency employees.
They are caIled economic hitmen.
Who are these peopIe?
Where do they meet?
No one knows.
Remember, Vikram, India
is the fastest growing market.
India is the future.
That's why an attempt
there is to...
...pressurpressurize her
e from everywhere aII corners.
This is the modern day warfare.
That's why Trincomalee dock.
This Lankan coastline
is so strategic for everyone.
Yes. And that's why
they are supporting Anna...
...if Anna comes to power...
...then they wiII gain control...
...over entire South
East Asia via Trincomalee Dock
...and that wouId a
national threat for India
That's the reason why ex-PM
is not so popuIar with them.
He doesn't want war.
He wants a peacefuI
political soIution.
And that's why Anna.
Anna is an ideaIist.
And He'II he wiIl continue the
war tiII he doesn't get freedom.
And they will exploit this.
Wait here. - Okay.
Package pIease.
Your eVidence. Let's go.
NasaI. - Nasal.
IIpa - Pal
Ant.
What have we got?
They are possibIy discussing an
assassination of a national leader.
Sir, the intercepts.
Two of them have been decoded.
Have you informed RD?
Not yet, sir.
I was waiting for you.
Bala?
So they trapped him.
Honeytrap.
Oldest trick of the intel world.
I, too, doubted Had my
doubts about him but this..
So they exposed BaIa.
Perhaps Bala had
become useless for them.
The And they either eliminate
or expose the useless.
This is how our worId works.
This better be good.
This is serious, sir.
The intercepts we got
from Vikram have been decoded.
You better see it.
Sir, that's Anna's voice.
It originated from his camp.
The words, sir.
Garland. Important. Leader.
They are going for
the ex-prime minister.
Get me Vikram. ASAP.
Sir, there's one more thing.
Bala's surveilIance report.
Bank accounts.
Income worth thousands
of doIIars from unknown accounts.
FiVe fake passports.
Eight tickets to Singapore.
EVeryone perceives
the truth differently.
It depends on where
you are choose to stand.
Remember, my friend.
This meeting never happened.
Bala, your tape has been released,
you must Ieave now..
Sir, I have eVidence.
He was honey-trapped.
He compromised everything.
I believe they bIackmailed him.
Yes, Vikram.
We, too, know about
his secret bank accounts..
..fake passports
and traVeI detaiIs.
He didn't just sell us out.
He soId out the entire country.
Now you Iet the
department handle him.
But you Come back here immediateIy.
The intercepts between Jaffna
and Madras have been decoded.
There's There is a pIot
to assassinate the ex-PM.
This is a serious threat
and we need to move fast.
You are drinking too much.
Are you okay?
You Go to sleep.
Don't worry about me.
Bala.
Why did you do this?
Why?
And my wife?
What was her fault?
It wasn't her fault.
That was a mistake.
You were the target,
but you survived.
You're lucky.
And the second arms deaI?
My kidnapping?
You were behind it, Bala?
I have information that two
meetings took place in Singapore.
Where Rajsekharan represented Anna.
It's obViously
a weII-designed plan.
Here's a copy of decoded
intercepts for you.
We've Very littIe time.
Brief your best team.
Find out, where is it
this going to take pIace,
who aIl are invoIVed?
Who? How? What? When? Where?
I need all the information.
And Vikram.. - Sir.
He is no Ionger the prime minister.
He's out of power.
It won't be so easy to operate.
keep that in mind.
We need solid evidence.
Okay, guys.
Ghosh, first code.
Between Jaffna and London.
Anna is instructing Rajsekharan.
It has no meaning.
Gibberish, right?

Anna and Rajsekharan.
Second code, quick. - Right.
Don't leave home.
We need to garIand

Here, home means Madras.
And important prince, what
we guess, is our ex-prime minister.
From Jaffna to Madras.
In Jaffna we can
hear - Anna and Pandyan.
In Madras - The calI
was made to a PCO in Madras.
We still haven't been
able to track the receiVer.

Jaffna?
Okay. Keep him on surveiIIance

For any job,

Where did you get this from?
I was investigating these banks.
And realized such banks
only exist on paper.
They remain for a few days,
months and then,
they just disappear.
So, first the speech by the ex-PM.
Then Rajsekharan goes
to Madras Café, London.
And that's where
possibly things happened.
'Anna, he's coming back to power.'

'The special investigation
squad has reveaIed..'
'..the use of pIastic
explosiVes and RDX.'
'So far this bIast has
cIaimed 25 peopIe's IiVes,
and injured more than 100 people.'
They were those who
came to the raIIy...
..to support our
former prime minister.
Just Iike that.
What was his fault?
He was so young.
We tried.
But we lost. - 'President
has requested peopIe to stay calm.'
'Leaders aIl across the world
haVe expressed their condolences.'
'After some time..' - Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
'The investigation team
arrested a few suspects.'
'And a few suspects committed
suicide before they could be arrested.'
'And l submitted my report
to the special investigation team.'
This commission appreciates
your inVestigations.

'l'd neVer reaIized that...
...the worId is so threatened
by our Prime Minister.'
'RD sir resigned after a few days.'
I hope you'Ve giVen this
decision of yours a thought.
Yes.
And I took a voIuntary
retirement and came here.
WhateVer you just said
could also be just a coincidence.
No, Father.
This conspiracy was played
out just as it was pIanned.
And I was Iate.
But I couIdn't compete with him.
They were powerfuI.
And In this game we
Iost our Prime Minister.
And the Lankan Tamils
- their future.
Then who won?
I don't know.
Perhaps it was eVeryone's loss.
And Anna?
One man's revoIutionary
is another man's terrorist.
Anna is revolutionary
for his people.
But I Iost my Prime Minister.
What wilI you do now?
Ruby's father gaVe this to me...
...on our wedding day.
A wedding gift.
Where the mind is without
fear and the head is held high..
Where knowledge is free..
Where the worId has not
been broken up into fragments..
By narrow domestic walIs..
Where words come out
from the depth of truth..
Where tireIess striving stretches
its arms towards perfection..
Where the clear stream
of reason has not lost its way..
Into the dreary desert
sand of dead habit..
Where the mind is
Ied forward by thee..
Into every-widening
thought and action..
Into that heaven of freedom,
my Father,
Iet my country awake..
Thank you.
