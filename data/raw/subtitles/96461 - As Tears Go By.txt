To avoid wasting time in travelllng
I'll let her llve with you for
severaI day! OK?
Didn't I have a cousin really?
She's your second uncle's
daughter, Ah-ngor!
Who is it?
I just thought that you were out!
I'm Ah-ngor!
You are my cousin, aren't you?
Just treat yourself at home!
There are kitchen and washroom
Hello! Someone's calllng me!
Tell him to call me later!
Hello!
Hello! Can I speak to Brother Wah?
He's sleeping. Who is calllng?
You don't even know me
You must be his new friend
I'm Fly! Who are you?
I am his cousin!
Cousin?! Never mind!
Tell him that I'm waiting for
bargaining with Fat-karl
Tell him to contact me
when he get up
OK!
Hello!
Hello, Cousin!
Didn't Brother Wah get up?
Didn't still! ls it urgent?
Didn't you want me to wake him up?
No, thanks! lf he get up,
tell him that I'm still
waiting for Fat-karl
and tell him to call me!
OK!
Go to sleep if you are tired!
I could sleep in the llving room tonight!
Why do you wear a gauze-mask?
To avoid infecting other!
What kind of disease?
The doctor said that my lung
is malfunctioning
and tell me to see a speciallst
You won't die!
Just eat more oranges and
you'll be alright!
So strange!
A guy called Fly had phoned you
severaI time a while ago!
Really? What did he say?
Hello!
Hello, lIttle cousin!
Haven't Brother Wah get up?
Hello!
I'm still staying with Fat-karl
for collecting debt
Damn it! You still haven't
get the money till now?
He's just making fun of you!
you stay there and I come at once!
I cannot go for dinner
with you tonight!
Here's one hundred dollars
for your dinner!
The key is under the carpet!
Take it off, would you?
It isn't looking good
Have a cup of tea first!
Fat-karl, I tell you...
I'm doing you favour
to talk with you
for such a long time
l, Fly, am not famous
because I'm not quallfied
also my Big Brother always
tell me to be subtle
Did you know Mr Aeroplane
of Agah-chee Wan?!
He had made a debt of $1 600
and just paid it late for two days,
now he cannot fly,
and have to sit on a wheeI chair
I did that with my own hands
Are you trying to frighten me?
He, Aeroplane, is a nobody
and cannot be compared to me
I tell you...
I, Fat-karl,
never before have the habit
of paying debt
Let's say that Big-Circle
who were more powerful...
and now Big-Circle
becomes Small-Circle!
Do you know why?
It was because he forced me
to pay his debt,
so I hit him nearly into death
He now get only one eye left!
Just having two years experience
don't you have the guts to collect my debt?
I got knife-scars more than
the number of your leg's hair!
Scar? My Big Brother has one!
I'll cut myself if you have!
Cut yourself then!
Haven't you finish talking?
We're in the beginning still!
Still in the beginning for so many hours!
Don't you want to die?
Don't move! Everybody don't move!
Would you pay the debt?
Yes, yes! Why wouldn't l?
It's unbellevable! So easy!
I know, just by his face,
that he is a sheep wearing tiger's skin
With so many companions,
they will strike you in the very
beginning if they have guts
You are right!
This is for you!
Thank you, Brother!
Where are you going Big Brother?
Brother Wah!
Visiting Mabel?
Yeah!
She hasn't go for work yet!
I'll wait for her downstairs
OK!
That boutique has a lot of
new arrival!
Really?
I'll go to the boutique with
you some other day!
OK!
Mabel!
Come here!
I didn't have my dinner!
Would you go eating with me!
That's OK if you don't llke to!
Why did you go to work so lately?
I just left from the hospital
Just from the hospital? Why?
Stomach-washing again?
Not stomach-washing!
It's abortion!
Are you kidding?
You can treat it as kidding
if you llke to!
No it won't! Why didn't you tell me
that you were pregnant?
Had you gave me a chance
to tell me?
I had waited for three day!
But didn't you call me?
You could call me if I didn't!
Call you! What could I tell you?
Tell you I'm going for abortion
or tell you to marry me?
We'd been together for six years!
What did I get finally?
I feIt llke not knowing you
and didn't even get any money
I'm so poor that I had to borrow
my mother's money for abortion!
Speak up! What did I do for?
Shut up!
Stop saying!
Since the day we'd met,
you knew already what kind
of person I am
Don't stay with me if you want
to marry & want money
Don't think that because you had
abortion so secretly
that I would feeI sorry for
all the rest of my llfe
I won't!
Your mouth said you won't
but your heart said you will
Because you didn't bother me,
didn't care about me
I spoiled your baby
And I am going to tell everybody
that I had your baby aborted,
so that you'll feeI guiIty for
the rest of your llfe
You've got the guts!
Cousin!
Are you alright?
Cousin!
What's the matter, cousin?
Are you lovelorned?
What did you say?
What did you say?
I tell you! Never talk
about lovelorn again
Or else, I'll throw you out!
Did you see the doctor?
I just returned from the hospital
What have the doctor said?
I will get the report tomorrow!
Haven't you have your meal?
Go eating with me!
I have make the meal!
Fly had phoned you again
this morning
What had the dirty guy said?
Nothing special!
Just some casuaI talk!
Didn't he ask anything about me?
What kind of thing?
The thing happened last night!
Fly had asked only once!
What? What did he ask?
I'm afraid to tell you!
Just tell me what you heard!
Do you insist me to tell you?
He asked me if
you were lovelorned
You have been here for all day!
What didn't you go out?
No place to go!
I have no friend in Kowloon
Eat quickly!
We'll go out together tonight
Cousin, are you studying or working?
I'm working already!
What kind of job?
I'm working in a friend's restaurant
Boy friend?
Well! Not quite!
Everybody call him Uncle Tang
Let us go to the cinema a while later!
We'll go if you are free!
You have no need to stay with me
Calllng rescue?
Ah-site, how much have you lose?
Five hundreds!
I won't play for so lIttle money!
One thousand for one game,
agree for not?
One thousand? What's your opinion,
King of snooker?
What? To see my qualIty
just by one thousand dollar?
I play with single-hand
in this game,
for two thousands
Single hand!
Let's sign contract at once!
Ah-site!
Single-head!
Another ball into pocket!
What's your opinion?
Right, King of snooker is really great!
Ah-site, how many scores have I lost?
No need to calculate!
He has thirty scores more than you
Still has five scores more than you
even if you win all the ball rested
How do you look?
That means we need
a targeting stick!
Ah-site, bring me my private cue
Start, start!
Stunt Follow
Get away!
Get out of my way!
Now, set the targeting stick!
Not stable! Make it more stable!
Beware! You will lost 7 scores!
Save that balls! Save it!
Are you taking me as a dead!
Fuck off!
Big Brother!
What's the matter, Big Brother?
Get away!
Go away, bastard!
Don't go!
Don't go!
Bastard, don't block the way!
Damn you!
Damn it! Damn it!
Fuck off
Big Brother!
Could we leave now?
It's OK!
Be quiet, would you?
Are you alright?
I'm alright!
Why don't you go to sleep?
It's so late
Cousin, my report said that
my heaIth is alright
I want to celebrate with you at first,
but, Auntie said the weather is fine
& the restaurant is busy these days
Uncle Tang want me to go back earller
I have called you twice,
but you have no response
You must be very tired, I think
Summer is coming
& many people will spend
their hollday in Lantau lsland
Do you have hollday working
in such career?
l've made a meaI for you
in the kitchen
Besides, l've bought severaI glasses
I know, they will be all broken
sooner or later
So l've hid one of them
One day when you need this glass,
give me a phone, and...
I'll tell you where it was hidden
Goodbye, Ah-ngor!
Everybody!
Be quiet! Be quiet!
All my relatives and all my guests,
today is the wedding of
my brother, Ah-site
We've prepared some simple
food to serve you
Would we all raise our glasses
I drink first
Cheer!
l've already said that two hundred
dollars were too much
How would I know he would
hold the ceremony on the roof!
Please eat!
Use your meal, please!
Don't behave this way! Eat!
Look at this way!
Take one more photograph!
OK! OK!
Thank you!
Go bring your mother-in-law and
father-in-law to take a photograph!
Hurry up!
Father, would you take a photograph!
No!
Take it, father!
No!
Don't be llke that,
go take a photograph!
No! What for?
It's really a shame!
Eat quickly if you want to!
We must leave soon
or else I'll faint
Don't be llke that, father!
Don't hold any celebration
if you don't have money
Celebrating on the roof
is extremely unbellevable
I just don't know how to teach you
You have never done
a good work in the past
It's your brother's wedding!
Why did you made it so shabby?
Don't you think that I didn't
want to make it luxurious?
But I have no money!
What can I do?
Damn it! So noisy!
Gay fellow!
What did you say?
What did I say?
I said you are gay!
I did serve you shark's fin
or abalone, didn't you?
It has no air-conditioning!
Why are you so talkative?
You only deserved vegetaI abalone
lf your son-in-law didn't
say you love eating abalone,
I won't let you have it!
lf I know you are so troublesome,
I'll give you shit, not abalone!
Are you looking for death?
Don't you dare throwing things to me?
Don't block my way!
Let me kill him
Don't you want to fight?
Don't do that, Big Brother!
Want to fight, don't you?
Hey, now what do you want?
Get away!
I tell you, don't make any noise!
What can't I speak?
Sit down!
Get lost!
Good boy!
Sit, sit down!
Hey! ls it right?
He's really bastard
Do you really want to fight
before Big Brother?
Don't you?
Speak up! Speak once more!
Anyway, he is Ah-site's father-in-law
lf you make trouble,
your young brother will be embarrassed
Do you agree?
OK! It's my fauIt!
I'm wrong!
My young brother,
I make you suffered today
I'll pay for it when I have
money some days
I knew that it's our turn
But it happens so soon
The cops arrested us last night.
They're just small fry, It's not a big deal
Big-mouth kay controls the money
They said that
The cops are making a deaI with him.
They wont him to be turncoat witness
This case is quite serious!
So that Godfather sent me
to inform you that,
don't make any trouble if
it is not necessarily these days
Hey, the pollce has a great
action outside!
All of you bastards
who have drugs and weapons,
go hide them away quickly!
Ah-wah, someone visiting
you outside!
Thank you!
What are you coming for?
I visit you with speciaI reason
Your brother, Fly,
owe us a sum of money
He hasn't pay the debt for severaI period
and didn't reply our call
My big brother sent me
to inform you that...
lf he don't show up tomorrow,
we won't give him any chance
Tell Tony that I know how
to teach my own man,
and, about the debt,
I will ask Fly
lf it's true,
I will bring him to see
Tony tomorrow
Do you want to see me?
You need money don't you?
I always need money
I'm used to it. I have big prospects
The fortune teller told me
I'll be freat at the age of 30
Every thing is finethen
No need to stay here
Did he told you that you can't llve to 30
No!
I heard that you borrowed money from Tony
Who is Tony?
I don't know him.
What did you say?
Engllsh
You knew that I don't know Engllsh
I ask you. Did you borrow money from Tony?
No!
No? Why are they looking for you?
They are eating around the corner
Do you want me to tell them you're here?
Yes!
Who are you winking to?
How much did you borrow?
Just a small sum. Take it easy
Small sum is also money
How much?
Hundreds bucks. It's not a big deal,
leave him alone
But they come to me
Tell me
4 meals and a pair of gold bracelets
Here are eight thousands!
What? Eight thousands?
Are you using one dollar as two?
It's so if he said it is!
The principaI is eight thousands!
What about the rest?
He haven't paid for
four instalments
Omitting the odd, he still owe us
thirteen thousand and five
We are giving you benefit
because we know you
Why don't you go robbing?
Who do you think you are?
Speak to me?
So fond of talking
Ah-kwong, talk to him for
severaI hours at there!
Yes!
Fuck off, you son of bitch!
Shut up! Get out!
Get out!
Your brother is lucky in
working under you
lf he is working for other,
he have already died!
Don't talk anymore
I don't want to talk about that
I return you the principaI first
But he really didn't have money
to paid the interest
So we have to delay for
two instalments more
Two instalments delay?
Why not return to me after my death?
You must trust me even
if you don't trust him!
I'll responsible for this debt
But I have no money now
I'll give you after two days
How can you be a Big Brother
if you don't have any money at hand
I think you better go farming!
I thought that you had money
so I dared to talk with you
You are such a poor Big Brother...
Did you really want it?
What's the matter?
What? You are crazy!
I have the gut to take it
if you have it now
OK! I diaI a phone first
Why are you standing here still?
Your boss told you to talk with me,
why didn't you speak?
What's your father name?
What's your mother called?
Stop joking, Fly!
Why didn't you speak?
You don't have parents?
Aren't you the boss?
Don't come near to me
I have some problem now,
can you lend me some money?
Could you?
Yes, I could!
Really?
Really! No problem!
Fly!
Now I borrow these money
from your boss
It's up to you, take it or not!
But, there's no debt between us
from now on
I tell you, if I become rich
in the future
I will paid back to you
Today, you are wrong
in helping outsider
to beat your own people
ls it right?
What are you waiting for?
Take the money to Tony!
CanceI each other!
This is given you as bonus!
You are really something!
Playing trick in my place
You are also great!
You've make fun of me!
Wait a moment
Get away!
Tony, I'm employing you
to guard this place,
instead of inviting robber to rob me
What do you mean by that?
Boss, he is just losing temper!
The situation is bad now,
but you two still fighting each other
Are you treating me as a dead?
It's him who done wrong first
Borrowed my money
causing trouble in my place,
and robbing my boss
He was wrong in the
whole situation, Godfather!
You know he is crazy already,
so don't bother him
And you are doing too much,
taking advantage from him
You must know that he was
guarding that place!
Godfather, I'm giving back!
He want the money back,
so I paid the debt
We've made an equaI exchange!
Equal?
What are you doing?
I'm the one who make decision till I die
So troublesome!
Now I tell you two,
you paid the instalments every month
And the event is settled in this way
Make a vow!
What are you two doing?
I told you two to make agreement!
Have a hand-shake? Shake
Ah-kay, the traitor,
is a witness for the pollce
We cannot let this guy survived
Kill him before he go to court
What's your opinion?
The task is difficuIt!
Which one should we send?
I don't want outsider to take this case
Let's make it this way
You two, find some smart boys
to draw dead lots two days later
He's the one, brave, and haughty
Send your younger brother
if he wish to do it
I'll let him go!
I'll let him not paying my debt
His family can have subsidize
if he fail
Do you have the guts?
What? What did you say?
Frightening me?
Shut up!
Don't making fun of the followers
You and me are the bravest
It's either you or me to take this case
I'll do it if you don't,
say it and I'll take it!
You'll do if you don't speak up
Say you don't and admit that
you are a coward. And I'll take the case
Wake up!
Now you two are pushing me together?
OK! I kill you two first
and then I'll kill him
Not again! Stop quarrelllng!
I have my plan in handllng this case
All of you go out first
I leave now, Godfather!
I leave now, Godfather!
Ah-wah, come back!
I know that you and your brother
are good friends
But he is too crazy. Teach him...
or he will llke a time-bomb beside you
and some day he will
cause you deadly trouble
I know, I have think of it
I want to find him a job
It's good to do it!

Don't go too far
Uncle Kwan, save it for yourself!
I'm teaching him to grow up
His gangster can treat me

Don't get near to me
Big Brother! Big Brother!
I tell you two,

Fly, this case certainly
won't end up this way
You take this money
And go back to Til-gang lln
and wait for the case to fade out
I won't go!
l've made a vow
I won't go back to see my mother
if I do not succeed
OK, I go to Lantau lsland with you
Why do you drive me away

You know he is just a mad dog
Why don't you llsten to me
not to provoke him?
It's him who provoked me,
I didn't provoke him
Don't you think I should just about it!
I have the power to play, haven't l?
Don't you have the power
to play with him?
lf you have, you won't be beaten
so heavily and have face swollen up
Yes, I was beaten to
have face swollen
You are blaming me on losing you face,
you can leave me alone
No one force you to speak this
Don't speak it for fun
I leave you alone now
lf you are safe when
you go out tomorrow
I'll do anything for you
We all don't know what
will happen tomorrow
Do you agree?
Let's go eating out!
Come along!
Beat him!
Fly, I twist your face
I twist you to death
I can plot against you
this time, can't l?
Don't beat my Big Brother
Leave him alone. Just beat me up
Not enough?
Let me beat your brother up.
That makes you two pairs
I want you to see
how I fooI around your brother
Shit

l, Tony, is very justified
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth
Don't move!
It's the most sensitive place of you
I don't know where will you
eject if you move
Great! I'm lucky this time
Will I still be so lucky next time?
You are so excited
Do you want to join our party?
OK! Come join us! Come on!
You cannot move a lIttle
You will eject on this brother
or that if you move
Don't let them look down on you?

You must go back to Til-gang lln
& never go out again
Tough guy
But whether you are tougher
than this thing
It's very hard... very hard...
Very, hard, isn't it.... very hard isn't it...
Look at you, bitch!
Another one collapsed
Damn you! You are pissing!
You should wear him a napkin
before taking him out
What kind of Big Brother are you?
Right! Let your head down
so that you can see your face by the urine
And see why you are such a failure
Then, go back to your motherland
and farm with your Big Brother
Urban road is not suitable for you?
Do you understand?
It's alright, alright!
Where... are you going?
I'm letting you lose face
Just treat that you've never know me
From now on I have no business
to do with you
Just leave me alone
Cousin
Open the door! Open up!
Open the door!
Hurry up! Open the door!
What's the matter?
My cousin feIt to the ground
& hurt himself
He's alright. Let him take a rest first
Where have you been last night?
I was staying with cousin
Lock the door when you leave!
Give me a phone if anything happens
She's coming
Hey, receive guests
I'm sorry
You talk to each other first
Shooting in a pollce station
won't cause death penaIty
Go to jaiI for severaI years
and become a man when you come out!
Now people call you boy,
and they'll call you ''sir'' tomorrow
It's a chance to be famous!
Understanding?
Godfather. I'm afraid!
What? Afraid! You've drew the lots
and now you said you afraid
Every colleague will kill you
even if I let you go
Don't say so much! Keep going!
Godfather, I'm really afraid
Chicken-hearted
Godfather, l've got something to talk to you
$23.5 with tin. Here is $30.
No change. Thanks

He's your husband, not my father
When will you calm down
and stop escaping?
Why did you come out to see me?
Why don't you leave me alone?
Who will care for you if I don't?
Don't think that you'll be
famous after this task
Right, everybody will say
you are brave this time when you do that
But no one will remember you next week
But what become of you then?
No one will know you later
l've done many things
for godfather also
I had received money for death
when I was fourteen
I was greater than a lot of people, right?
But look at me!
I'm just an ordinary man now
Anyway, you were famous
for sometime!
But what about me?
No one notice me and
you are happy about that
People look down upon
everything of me
They even said that
I was a dog beneath you ass
Do you know that?
I would rather be three-minute hero
I don't want to be a fly for all my llfe
Let me finish a great task on my own,
would you?
Just for this time
OK! Did you decide to go?
I'll go with you if you want to
I'll take revenge for you
if you are shoot down
Don't treat me so good,
would you?
I can't pay you back
I don't want to talk
so much with you
Just say it, and I'll go with you
We'll go to Lantau lsland
if you say no
I'll settle anything following
OK! OK! OK!
I go back with you
Ah-choi, Ah-choi
Don't look down upon other

Don't be so stingily!
Give something to Ah-cho
