Good morning. It's 52 degrees
at nine o'clock
this Tuesday, June 23rd,
and here is our top story.
Tragedy in Knoxville.
Two days ago,
Sunday morning, June 21st,
a lone gunman entered
the Knoxville Baptist
University campus
with rifle in hand.
There, he climbed
the clock tower
and began firing
into the crowds below.
Thirteen are reported dead,
with 26 critically injured.
President Reagan
and the First Lady arrived
in Knoxville this afternoon
to console the grieving families
of the fallen.
Police have yet to release
the identity of the shooter,
but an anonymous source
is reporting
that the suspect in custody is
a 17 year-old boy.
We continue our coverage
on the Knoxville killings
with our very own
Frank Hutchinson,
who is live on the scene.

Uh, this is a message
for William DuKent.
Mr. DuKent. Um...
This is Bruce Cogburn.
I'm calling in response
to the letters
I've received from you.
I'm not sure how you...
you found me.
Perhaps you... you got my PO box
from an old agent or summit.
If so, that information
was never meant to be shared.
Nevertheless, it seems
from your letters, Mr. DuKent,
you know quite a bit about me.
So I can only assume
you're aware of my sentiment
when it comes to
discussing my work.
I don't do interviews.
Never have.
And I never will.
Anyway, I...
I want to wish you
all the best with your book.
The blank page can be
a terrifying prospect at times,
so good luck.

Mr. DuKent,
this is Bruce Cogburn
calling you again.
Every time I make
one of these calls,
I have to travel 14 miles
to the nearest phone booth.
Now, I feel I've been
nothing but courteous
when it comes to your book
and how I have no interest
in helping you with it.
But it seems I'm not
making myself clear.
So, piss off.
Your letters are unsolicited
and constitute harassment,
so please, stop sending them.
In the meantime, I'm going
to get rid of my PO box
so you can save yourself
the bother.
And one more thing.
You keep asking me,
why I never wrote a second book.
21st June. 1981. Knoxville.
But you know that.

the Earth is round. Right?

My brother? He's hardcore.
Ten years back,
he had a job cutting tires
for a race team
outside Carson City.
You know? They called
him the Dirt Whisperer
'cause, you know, he could
just look at a track
and know exactly how
to set those tires up.
Last race of the season,
you know,
championship points on the line,
the track is just beyond muddy.
Cars are sliding
all over the place,
and my brother calls his
driver in
to switch out the tires.
And like a dozen laps later,
the back tire blows.
Driver loses control, that's it.
Hits a car, that car hits
another car. So on, so on.
Next thing you know,
four drivers, dead.
So, you know,
they do their investigation,
and they find nothing wrong
with that tire.
It just blew.
Sometimes that just happens
in racing.
What happened to your brother?
LAURA: He quit racing.
Spent a few years bouncing
from rehab to rehab.
Now, he's a night manager
at Walmart.
Which is a shame 'cause...
he loved racing.

"William DuKent is a right

That's right, the fire marshal
revealed there is evidence
that someone intentionally set
this suburban Aspen home
on fire.
Neighbors tell me the home
has been abandoned for decades,
but the evil, as they call it,
that once lived here
at 53 Highland Avenue
was once the center
of a national tragedy.
In June of 1981,
17-year-old Dwight Tufford
left his Aspen home
to drive 23 hours
to Knoxville, Tennessee.
Once there,
he did the unthinkable,
killing 13 people and injuring
nearly two dozen more
in just a matter of minutes.
From the top of the tower
in the middle of campus,
Tufford took aim
at the crowd below
with a high-powered rifle.
During the trial,
Tufford told the judge
he was innocent, and testified
he was brainwashed into
committing the killings
after reading
the controversial novel,
The Infernal Mach...

me what he wanted from you.
My opinion.
Your opinion about what?
A book. The Infernal Machine.
You ever read it?
No. Good. Don't. That
book will fuck you up.
The right combination of words
will make a man do...
just about anything.
MALE OPERATOR: (OVER INTERCOM)
Five minutes.
You ever heard
of number stations before?
During the Cold War,
there was these
short-wave radio broadcasts
that sent out these cryptic
messages across the airwaves.
Usually, a woman's voice
spouting out numbers
and shit in German.
And to the general public,
it sounded like
a bunch of nonsense,
when in actual fact,
it was a complex cipher.
The beauty of this was,
instead of marking X on a window
or hiding microfilm
in a hollow tooth,
these sons of bitches
had the audacity
to send their top-secret
transmission
right out into the open
for the whole world to hear.
What, are you saying there's
a hidden message in that book?
DWIGHT: Something like that.
And what is it? Well, you
didn't read it, now did you?
So it would be like
trying to describe
the color turquoise
to a blind man.
So, I'm a blind man now?
You all are.
That's funny. I thought
we were all dominos.
I'm done talking here.
Hold on.
It's so easy to sit on
that side of the world
and judge me, isn't it?
Why did DuKent want
your opinion?
Ask him yourself.
Guard.
Please, just tell me now.
(BELL BUZZING)
He wanted to know if I saw
the same things in the book
as he did.
But in the end,
he turned out to be
just a fucking liar,
like everyone else.
Why? What did he lie about?
He told me
that if I was honest with him,
then he'd show up.
That he would? DuKent?
No. The motherfucker
that put me in here.

I know where we are, Mr. DuKent.
I know exactly where we are.
We're at the end
of act two, aren't we?
That's where the protagonist
reaches their limits.
Questions their worth.
Their sanity. Everything.
Because they know
the path traveled
pales in comparison
to what lies ahead.
And it's in this moment,
Mr. DuKent,
that a decision must be made.
Do they carry on,
or do they stop and go back?
But only they
can make that choice.
And that, Mr. DuKent,
is where you fucked up.
Because your protagonist
is too aware
of your narrative now,
and to make matters worse,
he's also a writer.
So he knows exactly
what a good story needs,
and also how to sabotage one.
What's the greatest sin
a writer can commit?
Do you know?
Being dull.
And that's exactly
what I'm going to give you,

The FBI's manhunt is focusing
its search on Dwight Tufford
in the Los Alamos area
of New Mexico.
Despite being held
in a maximum-security prison,
Tufford somehow slipped
past the guards last night,
sparking a nationwide panic.
In 1981, Tufford arrived
at the Knoxville Baptist
University campus with a rifle.
Taking aim, he pointed his gun
at the crowd below
and he shot dozens.
Thirteen students
and faculty members died.
He is responsible for
the deadliest shooting
in Tennessee history.
One witness described it
as mass chaos.
No one knew where the bullets
were coming from,
or where to run.

What, you think

to convince me otherwise?
Why don't you give it a go?
I'm not sure you'll have

the bullets out of the gun.
Bullshit.
Well, there's only one way
to find out.
Right. So, I think
we are going to do this,
so why don't you take a seat?
What do you want?
From you? Nothing.
Then who are you?
Say a young couple
wants to get married.
They find themselves
a wedding planner.
Or if you want to host
a fancy dinner party,
you hire a chef.
But if you need to turn
someone's world upside down,
then you hire me.
And that's what
you think you're doing?
No, it's what I've done.
The proof of that is you
sitting right opposite me.
Thank you.
The reason I'm sitting
opposite you is
because I found
your fake daughter.
You're a sicko,
endangering a kid like that.
Endangered? (CHUCKLES)
That's a bit dramatic, isn't it?
That little angel went home
with 300 dollars in her pocket.
All she had to do was
pretend to be
someone else for a few hours.
Isn't that what you've been
doing the last 25 years?
Do you know, the difference
between you and I
is that I know what I am.
I'm a liar.
And I'm fucking good at it.
I can be anything
you want me to be.
Could be a person,
a company, a scenario.
Usually, the marks are
sort of politicians and CEOs.
They're always boring.
They're always forgettable.
And that's what separates
you from them.
What, because I'm not boring?
Oh no, you're very boring.
But you're not forgettable.
And that's why
I took this assignment.
Because history is going
to remember you, Bruce.
And that really bothers me.
Because you dress in your
sort of Sam Shepard clothes,
and you drink like Capote
and live like Thompson,
all so the world will know
there's artistic genius,
but you and I know
there's no artistic genius.
There's no mystique.
Shut it.
You got lucky.
You built your ivory tower
brick by brick with lies.
Shut your fucking mouth.
And I'm here
to make sure you burn in it.
'Cause you see, it's pride
that's the Achilles' heel
of mediocre men.
Shut it with
your fucking pride talk.
That's not the reason
why I'm here.
Right. Sorry. Yes, of course.

I so carelessly endangered.
Okay, total hypothetical here,
what if, just what if,
I wanted you to find the girl,
her mother, my office,

you a fucking genius,
