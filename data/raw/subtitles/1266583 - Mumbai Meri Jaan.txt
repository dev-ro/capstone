At the stroke of the midnight
hour when the world sleeps...
...India will awaken to
the light of freedom.
People are our real strength.
Our real strength is to
make this world strong.
So, brothers and sisters..
Indians, unite.
Indians, be strong.
Indians, march ahead.
If we think like this
then nobody can stop us!
Nobody can suppress us!
Two plates of mutton chops.
Tea! Here!
Tell me.
What was the problem in
the football match?
Two teas on table three.
Chhotu, serve water here!
What a solid head-butt!
What's his name?
His!
- Yes.
His name.. is 'Jakos Lavakii
Vachipuchi Vakola.'
Why do you care about the name?
You don't even know
the difference between..
.. Sharon Stone and kidney stone.
That day I asked him
his father's name..
..and he was blank for half an hour.
He then came up with three names.
And he's still unsure about it.
All the three fathers that
he named are still arguing.
One says he has my nose.
The other says he has my height.
And the third says his
colour matches mine.
Suresh!
{Dead Rippers Society - FarooqBhai}
Good that France lost.
After Zidane pleaded..
No, Suresh.
I was a bit sad.
It would have been nice if
Zidane had won the match.
His wife would have been
happy and his children too.
And brother would have
played football in bed too.
And head-butted his wife as well!
Do you know who the most
important person in France is?
The President.
- Yes.
Zidane had retired. President
especially called him and said..
Hey, since when did Zidane
become your brother?
You've never ever
called me brother. - You too!
Now that the team has
reached the finals..
..he is showing his true colours.
No, Suresh. It's not that.
Then what is it?
That player from Italy..
what's his name?
Materazzi.
- Materazzi.
He called brother Zidane..
Zidane a terrorist.
So what?
He is a Muslim,
so he said it.
Uncle, how are you?
- Fine.
He was playing from that team,
how can you talk about religion?
Brother Musa,
greetings.
Why? Doesn't France have Muslims?
Lower your voice!
Sit!
He harassed you,
didn't he? - Yes.
I will order tea.
Brother Musa, two teas!
Are they the chief guests?
I say, the French team is hardly French.
Listen to me.
Two or three are whites.
The rest are all black imports.
Hey!
- Yes!
They will select you for
the French team!
Correct! Correct!
He is right.
They need someone for
that kind of a job.
Shut up.
Listen! If I get angry,
I will thrash both of you!
Why will you thrash just both of us?
And not thrash Suresh.
- Shut up.
I'll trash you both!
Hey! That's enough!
It's mine. Put that down.
Why are you getting angry?
Look at them!
- They are just joking!
Anyway, what else
can we do with you?
Correct!
Yusuf! Yusuf!
Suresh, you are the only one who can
treat us to cold drinks. - Yes!
I haven't sold a computer in
the last 3 months.
I'm flat broke.
I have a ten rupee note.
I have to survive on it
for the entire day.
Do you understand?
Brother Ashok?
Okay, friend.
People say that some
Brahmins of the village..
..are responsible for
this terrifying incident.
These are the three women
who lost their husbands..
..and became widows that night.
Let's talk to them.
What are you feeling right now?
Do you know
who is behind all this?
These women are living in
the shadow of fear and terror.
Even after losing their husbands..
..they are not willing to say anything.
The police and government
are also mum about it.
Today in the 21st century,
we want to call India a super power.
Yet this village in India remains..
..bogged down with caste
and religious barriers.
With cameraman Vasu,
this is Rupali Joshi for TV News.
On TV News..
Wow, Rupali Joshi,
you are outstanding.
Thank you.
Chief Minister wants an
immediate investigation..
Leave it on.
Sorry, when the TV is on,
you don't talk to me.
You only watch TV.
You know why I watch TV?
To see your beautiful face again and again.
Really.
So especially for you,
I'm out of the TV..
..and sitting right in front of you.
You can look at me all you want.
But I like seeing you on TV.
But my show is over.
They won't telecast it again and again.
Rupali, you looked
so nice on that show..
..you were looking so beautiful..
Really!
Please don't mind, in reality
you don't look that good.
Really!
- Really.
Really!
Hey!
- Don't talk to me!
Do you know how painful it is
to go to these remote places..
..and shoot with people?
I toiled hard for this report.
And all you saw was my face!
Great.
Frankly, that was the only
good thing in the report.
You mean the report was bad.
I mean it wasn't good.
My bosses loved it you know!
According to them,
it is one of the..
..nicest news reports in recent times!
Do you know you don't even
get a bus to go there?
And I spent two days
with those people.
I am not denying it.
Everything else was fine,
but there is..
..one thing I really
don't understand, Rupali.
The woman's entire family is dead,
her children are crying..
..and you are asking her questions..
..Like how do you feel?
How would it feel?
Of course, it will feel bad.
It won't feel good.
Don't you think sometimes you make a
spectacle out of everything?
The truth that you want to hear.
Why didn't you go to Bangalore?
The first news of the morning.
Only on Star News.
Come on, Patil sir.
We'll get late.
Wait, let me wear my shirt.
What if I went out like
this without my shirt?
Seeing my body,
girls will flirt with me.
And if they follow me home,
my wife will kick me out.
Wait, let me put on my shirt.
Accused police constable
Sunil More was found guilty..
..of raping a 16 year old student..
- Look at this!
Due to Sunil More's incident..
The entire department is defamed..
..because of one such fool.
I have never cast lustful
eyes on women.
But because of him, everyday
I have to bear the taunts..
..of any women I come across.
I don't even look at girls
these days while on duty.
Sawant, once Bhoite
and I were on duty.
A college girl threw some
garbage on the road.
Bhoite set out to do social service.
He told her, madam
the garbage bin is there..
..throw the garbage in there.
She barked back, you do it!
You don't do any other job.
The only work you do is to take bribes.
You people rape girls!
And you teach us!
Shame on you!
Patel sir, really!
A big crowd gathered quickly.
And we had to flee
the scene apologizing to her.
Otherwise.. - You would have
been in that garbage bin!
This man should be
handed over to the public.
The women will thrash him good.
No! He will die!
People like him should
die like this. -Why?
Just because he is a cop?
- Yes.
But he's still human.
I worked with him for three months
at the Meghwadi police station.
I never felt he could
do such a ghastly act.
Patil sir, it takes only two seconds
for the evil in us to take over.
And all sins are rooted in that time.
A doctor raping his patient.
A boss raping his secretary.
There is evil inside all of us.
Our department's duty is to
prevent such crimes, I agree.
But what if one of us does it?
Others too do such acts!
Everyone does the opposite
of what they should be doing.
Everybody accepts bribes, cheats..
..engages in wrongdoing.
But everything is done under the veil.
Only our department's corruption
is open to scrutiny.
Patil sir, everything is
so messed up that..
..no one knows where it all began.
Will you go to Mahableshwar or sit and crib?
Come on!
Kadam, you are going to Mahableshwar?
Yes!
- Yes!
Didn't you tell them?
- No!
There was no honeymoon
after his wedding.
So he is compensating for it now.
Understood?
This means Mahableshwar!
Mahableshwar!
Hey, if you drive any faster,
you will fly off. Idiot!
Yeah, baby! Yeah! No!
Okay!
Right! I love you so much!
I love you, baby!
Talk to you later! Okay! Bye!
Give me a cigarette.
Quick. - Okay!
Here!
Open the pack, man.
A packet of biscuit!
- Thanks, buddy!
Hey, what kind of a cigarette is this?
Don't you have the original brand?
I do, but it costs 90 rupees.
Here, take this. Keep 100 rupees!
But who told you to give me this cheap
and duplicate contraband?
Will you decide which cigarette I smoke?
See? How money talks?
Hello! Listen, I am busy right now!
I will call you later! Okay!
Bye!
- Tea!
Listen, I told you! I am busy!
Don't you understand?
What?
You know who I am, right?
And what I can do!
No! No, you listen to me first! Okay!
I don't like you talking
to me like that, okay!
Now will you please shut the..
Hell, man!
Here's the money.
Madam, sweet bananas for sale!
Give me a plastic bag.
- Plastic bag?
Hurry up.
If I give you a bag,
I will be arrested.
Nothing will happen.
Take it quickly.
- Thank you!
Sweet bananas for sale!
Do you know how harmful
the plastic bags are?
What can I do, sir?
We have to do it for business.
It will take 10,000 years for..
..this plastic bag to decompose.
That means, the plastic bag
from Lord Krishna's time..
..would still exist today.
Thankfully there were no plastic bags..
..in Lord Krishna's time.
Or the world would have
choked to death by now.
But sir, I've heard that there
were airplanes in those times.
That's not the point.
The plastic bags that you are
giving away are so harmful..
I am sorry I am late.
Got stuck in the traffic.
Come on.
- Okay!
Don't use plastic bags,
understood? - Okay!
Hang on! Hang on!
Is my plastic folder ok?
It's from my office. - It's not funny.
Then what's the difference
between you and him?
Suresh.
What is this?
That's it?
Where's the ten
thousand you promised?
Yes! That's all I have.
Now, you can't even meet
your interest payments?
Do you take me for a fool?
You are educated,
aren't you?
Get a job and at least think
of your old father.
Bye! And listen!
You better come up with
the money in 4 days. Got it?
What happened in
the 26th July floods?
Drains were clogged
because of all the plastic.
Why are you getting so serious?
You think you can change
the world on your own?
Yes, if every person does their bit,
change is inevitable.
Every person?
It's not about one person,
it's about the entire society.
But who has so much time in Mumbai?
Hi, Nikhil!
How are you?
I am fine, how are you?
- Life's going on.
Good that I met you.
Do you have some time?
I am in a bit of a hurry. You..
No problem,
we can talk on the train.
It will only take 1 0 minutes.
- Okay.
This is my friend Ashish.
- Hi.
And he is.. - You don't remember?
No problem.
Myself Bakul Patel.
- Bakul Patel. Sorry!
How are you?
I have such a great business idea..
..you won't need a job anymore.
The train has arrived.
Come on!
Sir, not in first class!
I am a poor man,
let's go in the second class.
No, no, not in the second class.
Never mind, we will talky later.
It is a matter of 1 0 minutes,
sir. Ashish, come on.
Me? No! You go ahead.
I will leave! Bye! All the best!
How are you?
Kadam sir.
You are going to your village.
Yes.
- Get something for me.
Of course.
- Don't forget.
Archana.
- Coming.
Give!
Who is it for?
For you, who else?
Why me? I have an umbrella.
Umbrella!
- Yes!
Have you ever been to Mahableshwar?
- No!
It is in the hills.
The umbrella will fly away
and so will you.
Wear it for me.
- No.
I am asking you to wear it and
not to take it off. - Get off!
Wear it once!
- No!
Show it to me!
- Okay!
You are a fool,
the camera is empty.
There is no film?
No.
There is no film?
Stop it.
- There is no film?
I will click your photos!
- No! No!
There is no film?
- No! No!
I have a great medical plan, Nikhil.
Get your check-up done every year..
..to see if you're in good health.
Excuse me. Hello.
Hello. Where are you?
I will be there in half an hour.
Okay fine, we are waiting for you.
Come quickly!
Listen, say hello to him.
Yes.. Hello.
Wait, talk to him.
Wait a second.
Hello.
Said hello?
Hello! Hello, Nikhil! Hello!
Hello!
- Yes!
Listen! I'll call you once I get off.
It's very crowded.
Fine.
- Take care!
Okay! - Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye!
We could have spoken later.
It's so congested here.
So why don't you buy a nice car?
Why? I travel in first
class very comfortably..
..and reach in half an hour.
If I travel by car,
it will take an hour or so.
You can appoint a driver too.
Why, why would I do that?
When the train is so convenient
why do I need a car?
Most people buy a car
as a status symbol.
People should use public
transport whenever possible.
Or Mumbai will die one day.
No, no, Mumbai won't die.
The people will.
Look! Look!
As you can see, the first class..
..compartment has been torn apart..
No help arrived for almost
an hour after the blast.
There was no police
and no ambulance.
We helped all the people.
We took the injured to the hospital.
How many corpses and injured..
..did you take out of the compartment?
We pulled out 15 to 20 dead bodies.
And you took them
to the hospital? - Yes
Your name, please.
- Sameer.
As you can see,
we are at Matunga station..
..where a powerful blast took
place about an hour ago.
The police have just arrived.
Take him!
No!
Nikhil always takes that train.
By God's grace, he was late
and took the next one.
No, we hardly travel.
And Sejal does not need
to commute either.
What?
I don't know about grandson
or granddaughter.
But we will surely
become grandparents.
Sejal? Sejal is watching TV!
And Payal too has been born
in that hospital!
Yes! She is an expert!
Diet is fine!
She has given a big chart sheet!
What happened?
Nothing.
Nikhil, I don't want to argue again..
..but do you have to take the train?
Sejal.. it is convenient.
No, you listen to me!
I was trying to reach you
from 6 in the evening to 7:30..
But your phone was switched off.
I was so worried.
- Why will I switch off my phone?
I am all alone.
I get tensed for you.
But the networks were jammed.
You could have borrowed a phone.
You could have just
called to say I am fine..
..I am coming home.
All networks were jammed.
Sejal, what do you want?
I am home now. I am home.
This is not what I meant.
- No! - Try to understand!
I was waiting for you.
Wondering what happened to you.
Wouldn't you get scared if you..
..had been waiting for me alone?
I was scared!
That's what I am saying!
Listen. - You don't understand!
- I understand!
So many times..
- I understand!
What are you saying?
You will get it at the corner too!
What is it? There were blasts in the city
and you want beer. Move it!
Leave!
- Come on! - Leave!
What do you have?
Take it out! Break it!
Break it, I say!
The bar is still open, isn't it! - Sir.
Get up, come on, and get out!
Come on, get lost. Shut that bar right now!
Come on, get moving!..
Hello, sir. - What's so funny?
Shut it down!
Get your hands off me!
Are you my friend?
I said shut it down!
Do I have to especially tell you?
Patil sir! Your senior was just here
and he said not to worry.
Kadam!
- Patil sir.
Hold on! Hold on!
Come on!
- Sit!
Will you only stare at me?
Have I ever been late for that?
Kadam sir is not ready to listen to me!
Fool!
Not me, give it to him.
He needs to calm down.
Here.
Listen.
- Yes.
Get a nice gift for me.
I am retiring in seven days.
Anything for you, sir. Just name it.
How about this bar?
What say? Idiot!
Come on!
Patil sir, tell me something.
My holiday gets cancelled
because of the blasts..
..but the bars are left open.
If you shut down the bars
too after the bomb blasts..
..then what happens to
the spirit of Mumbai?
I cancel my holidays and
come for work. What for?
Not for nothing.
It's right there in your pocket.
Shall we split it now? Give.
Don't you want your share?
Well, this is just the beginning for you.
I'll retire in a week.
And remember,
earn as much as you can..
..but better save it.
Once the badge is gone,
you lose all respect. Understood?
Don't you think this is wrong?
What's wrong with you today?
So you think everything is right?
Nothing is right or wrong.
- So what is it then?
It's about what works.
To leave the bars open is wrong.
So is letting them run
without protection money.
And you can't shut them down
after taking their money.
That's very wrong.
Understood? Let's go.
Are you going to cry now?
It's not allowed.
Crying in uniform is not allowed.
When the tears start to flow,
leak them out.
All the tears will be flushed out.
Come, let's take a leak.
I don't want to.
Come on.
I am your senior.
It's an order. Kadam, leak it out!
Okay, Rupali! Let's get these
figures right before we telecast.
Dead 150.
And what else do our reporters..
..have to say who are on the site?
Okay, at the moment all
the figures that we have..
..say that there have been
seven explosions as of now.
These are the stations
that have been hit.
The numbers of the dead
we have so far is 1 50 plus.
That number, I expect, is going
to go up by at least 25.
We don't know the exact time..
..of the blast at Mira-Bhayander.
I've written 6.29. But..
I am sorry. I have to go.
I'm relieving Sanyogita
at Cooper Hospital.
She's been there since seven.
See, if you can find anything
interesting there. Okay.
Yeah. Okay. Definitely. Bye.
Now this is the body of
a 60 year-old man.
He is a diamond merchant.
He was killed in the Jogeshwari..
..explosion which happened at 6:25 pm.
He had diamonds worth
50 lakh rupees in his bag.
I think this is really an
interesting story there.
We should follow
the story of the diamonds.
Nasir.
- Yes.
We have to telecast this
day after tomorrow. Okay.
Okay.
- That's Thursday. 7:30 p. m.
Okay, Rupali, tell me
about that young boy.
Okay. He's not actually a young boy.
He's 27 years old.
Married with 2 kids.
He has a large family but
he was the sole breadwinner.
Now that's quite emotional.
That will make a good
Saturday night story.
That's exactly what I am thinking.
Saturday! Prime time! 9:30!
Let's first concentrate
on the fear factor!
Okay! Just get hold of
2-3 nice interesting stories!
Exactly! I mean
what happened today evening..
..was so terrifying that..
Hear me out, this is the structure.
I want to have a picture of the victim..
..with that we will put name,
age, occupation etc, etc.
And then all the family pictures,
home videos..
..personal letters.
We should collect all of it.
And also photographs!
Move!
Move aside! Please!
Give way! Please!
You check out there.
I will go and ask.
Excuse me. Listen.
Ajay Kumar..
Don't worry, sister.
He will be fine.
You check there. I will check here.
Okay. Don't worry.
As per the hospital reports till now..
..at least 70 injured people
have been admitted. - Hello.
Hello Rupali, Rensil here.
Yes, Rensil.
- Any news yet?
No, nothing.
Did you check at the Bhabha hospital?
We are just headed there.
Listen, don't hesitate
to call me anytime.
Okay! Anytime!
My cell is on for 24 hours. Okay.
Rupali, could you do me a favor?
It'll only take two minutes.
I know it's not the right time to ask.
But.. could you give me
a bite on this?
Hello. Rupali.
Yes but.. right now?
Listen, listen, Rupali.
Anandita is somewhere near you.
And she was sort of
hesitating to speak to you.
You know what I mean.
So please.. I mean..
We have with us our very
own Rupali Joshi..
..who you saw on TV News..
..right after the bomb blast,
reporting for us live.
Rupali Joshi's fiancée, Ajay Kumar,
is missing after the blast.
Rupali, how do you feel?
Any news on him?
Not yet. We have checked here.
And there is no news of him yet.
We are going to other hospitals.
We are on our way to
Bhabha right now.
This is a Government hospital, Rupali.
Is it equipped for such an emergency?
Or people are facing any problem?
Well, it's quite chaotic here.
But that's natural after such a tragedy.
Rupali, a while ago when you
were at the blast site.
The police was absent.
And there was no
government official in sight.
Would you like to comment?
At present, the most important thing
is some news about Ajay.
And we are trying our best.
That's it.
I and the entire team of
TV News wish that Ajay is..
I was watching TV at
home in the evening..
..when my sister called.
She said that there has been
a bomb blast at Khar station.
She was fine and told me not
to step out of the house.
I quickly switched to
the news channel.
-The entire train compartment
was torn apart.
I couldn't watch it for more
than two minutes.
Dead bodies, blood.
My friend was on one of those trains.
He says at least 300-400 people died.
Body parts strewn across the railway track.
A man was covered in blood.
From head to toe.
Somebody was screaming out
his wife and children's names.
And wailing.
Some people carried a dead body..
..and all they got in hand was body parts.
Who are these terrorists?
- Suresh!
- Hey! Stop!
What's in the bag?
- It's bread, sir.
Bread or a bomb?
- Bomb?
What are you laughing at?
Do I look like a joker to you?
Show me what's in the bag! Now!
Sir, look. It is just some bread.
Hope it doesn't explode in my stomach!
Is he drunk?
Who planned todays blast?
I don't know, sir.
No one from your clan involved?
Brother, nephew,
friend. - No, sir.
Really!
Tell me! Who planned today's blast?
- I don't know, sir.
Hey! What's going on here?
Tell me!
Sir, look who it is.
- So? What happened?
Nothing, I am just doing my civic duty.
Really? Drunk in the middle of the night..
..creating a ruckus.
Is that being civil?
I was just checking his bag.
Why are you getting into it?
We are still around.
Of course, sir.
You people are there.
No denying that and yet
the blasts occurred.
So many people died. Right?
Hey, maybe I should
help you get sober.
Now? It's late!
What's the use, sir?
You couldn't do anything
when you should have done.
Are you guys ever late for taking bribes?
What did you say?
Trying to act smart!..
- Tell him! - Come on! Come on!
Run! Run! Run from here..
Patil sir! Are you okay?
Come on! Run! Run!
- Run! Run!
Hey come on! - Run.. - Run..
- Stop! Go away from here.
Patil sir! Patil sir! Are you okay?
Hey you, get lost!
- Yes!
Are you fine, sir?
Yes, sir? Water!
Who were those guys?
I have no idea, sir.
- Who were they?
Well sir, I don't..
- Hey you!
Are they regulars? Why are you
serving such idiots? - Sir..
Hold your ears!
- What?
Hold your ears! Do sit-ups!
Hey Kadam, just forget it.
I'll be back and
you better not stop this.
Or else, I will send
you to Madras. - Sir!
He is Ajay Kumar,
height 5'10" or 5'1 1."
He is 28 years old.
He is slim.
Has long, black hair.
Has a mark on his abdomen.
Clean-shaven.
He was wearing white full-2leeved shirt..
..blue jeans and shoes.
Blue shoes with white stripes..
no, sorry, beige stripes..
Yes, beige!
Investigations have so
far revealed that all 7 blasts..
..were triggered by timer devices.
Police officials say, most
of the bombs were planted..
..at Churchgate station
of Mumbai between..
..6:00 and 6:15 last evening.
The police have confirmed that
RDX explosives were used.
But the forensic experts are still..
..investigating the nature of the bomb.
'Chhotu, clear the plates.'
Meanwhile the Mumbai police is
getting sketches made..
Tea.. - Based on eye-witness accounts.
Give tea at table number two.
To try and ascertain the identity..
..of those responsible for the blast.
One plate double omelet,
minced mutton and minced eggs.
The bomb blasts have raised
a question on security.
The police would have to answer
a few difficult questions..
- Mutton parcel in the days to come.
What did you do the last night?
He was a police officer.
The suburban trains of Mumbai..
I'm scared even to step out of home.
- Where are these guys?
Now we have to see that.. Who?
Those regular useless benchwarmers.
Who cares?
No! They were here that day in the afternoon.
We too were there.
That boy told them something..
..and they left pretty quickly.
So?
Nothing. They haven't been seen
since the blasts that evening.
Shut up! You have lost it, man!
They look like regular guys coming..
..for a cup of tea and a smoke.
That's all. - So? You think
terrorists don't like tea?
No, I mean..
That chap, what's his name.. Yusuf.
He can't possibly be a terrorist.
Skinniest guy I ever saw.
Like one rib.
How much do you think a bomb weighs?
A small packet.
Place it right and boom!
You don't need to be Mr. Universe.
But they don't look like terrorists.
You think they would wear
a T-shirt reading terrorist?
Or a tattoo on their forehead?
That chap, Yusuf.
He repairs air conditioners.
No! Who repairs those anymore?
Buying a new one is cheaper.. Shut up!
Do you know where he works?
- Yes.
Sure?
- Sure.
Come on, let's check it out.
Hey, wait! What are you up to, Suresh?
This is a bit too much!
- Yes!
We can go to the police if you want.
What else can we do?
- Yes!
Obviously! You didn't lose
a loved one in the blasts.
You guys need a bomb under
your bum as a wake-up call.
You will go straight to hell!
There too you guys won't do anything!
You will remain as you are!
Are you coming along?
- Yes!
As I thought, the shop is closed.
They must be across the border by now.
I think Yusuf stays nearby.
You think or do you actually know?
Well.. - Follow me.
And you wait here.
Suresh, let's go down there.
Hey, put the ball here.
Let's go, man!
When will the doctor arrive?
He is working on an emergency
case right now. - Okay.
He will be here in 1 0 minutes.
- Okay.
When should I take the medicine?
I have told her. You don't worry.
I know.
- Yes.
Take care!
- Okay.
Greetings.
Listen!
Ashish! How are you?
This..
This..
- Hey!
In this filth.
Manya.
- Yes. Ask him!
Uncle, where does Yusuf stay?
Which one?
Skinny or the fat one?
The skinny Yusuf.
There. See the green door.
- Yes.
That's the one.
- Okay.
"We are leaving.."
Beautiful song!
You know who's the singer?
- The great Mohammed Rafi!
They will never hear
Kishore Kumar's song. Come on.
Come on!
- Yes!
Where is Yusuf?
Yusuf is not at home.
Did you have some work?
He hasn't been seen since the blasts..
Actually we haven't
seen him for a while.
Are you Yusuf's friends?
- Come on in.
No, thanks..
Come! Sit!
- You fool!
Look there!
Yusuf was quite a cute kid.
Yes, he was simply adorable.
But these days he keeps
wandering around in the sun..
..and so has turned dark and ugly.
What are you laughing at?
Your faces look just as neglected.
Is Yusuf expected soon?
I don't know when he will come.
He just disappears for days
without informing me.
Only to suddenly reappear
with a shameless smile saying..
..I went on a picnic with friends.
He makes me so angry.
What can I say?
But that child is so lovable,
I can't stay angry for too long.
Here, have some sweets.
My nephew has sent
them from Agra. Wow!
Dear, why don't you tell
Yusuf not to do such things?
By Allah's grace nothing bad
has happened yet.
But he shouldn't keep
disappearing like this.
Will you explain to him?
- Yes.
Or do you behave the same as well?
No, no. Why don't you call Yusuf up?
We will know where he is.
He had called up the day
of the bomb blasts
He said he was absolutely fine..
..and was coming home for dinner.
But he neither came nor
has he called since.
Now the idiot has
switched off his phone.
- We don't have his new number.
There.. it's written over there, see?
We will call him up.
- Have some sweets first.
Can't. Stomach upset.
- Yes.
Both of you have stomach upset.
No, no.
- Then eat it. Okay.
32376..
Hey! What are you doing?
I will take the sweets with me.
Wait, I will wrap it up for you.
- Remember 986982..
- You children must have some names.
- Yes, we do, he is Su..
- Suleman.
Suleman. And you?
- Majid.
Suleman, Majid.
Majid.. Suleman
- Hey, Suresh! How much time?
- Coming! Come on, Suresh!
Bye, aunt!
- Come on! - Come on!
I told you people to wait!
Why did you come here?
Come on!
Yes! What's wrong?
-What's going on inside?
Nothing. We are just chilling,
man. What's wrong?
Don't you have any other work?
Go and look for the culprits of the blasts.
Get out of the car right now.
- Hey, hold on. Hold on! Okay.
Baby, just relax! Yes!
Yes, I am okay! Yes, what?
What do you have in there?
Cocaine?
Hey.. just lay off, okay?
Actually you know what?
I feel like spitting on your face.
Spitting.. - Hey! Stop!
What are you doing? - Stop there!
- Let go of him! Don't do this!
- 'What are you doing?'
Kadam, what was the need
to create such a scene?
And Patil, you.
Don't you understand!
Are you a rookie? Sir,
they were doing drugs, we saw them!
Get their medical test
done in the hospital.
They will test positive!
I don't want to hear a thing.
I don't even want to see their faces.
Please do something about them!
- Yes!
Both of you, outside.
- Don't you trust us, sir?
Get them out now or I am leaving!
Please sit, sir! Please sit.
I will do it. - Come on, Kadam.
I said get out! - Why are you
not listening to me, sir?
I don't want to.
Now get out of here.
There is no use working day and night!
If it's so troublesome then quit the job.
No one is keeping you here.
Patil, take him.
- Yes. Come on. - Come on!
Hey..
O Kadam!
Hey, I already told you that crying
in uniform is not allowed.
When the tears start to flow,
leak them out.
Hey, this was nothing.
You know, once I had arrested
a very famous man.
With such a large suitcase.
And do you know what
was in the bag? Cocaine!
I don't know what transpired
between my senior and the man..
..but he was instantly let off.
My senior tells me,
Patil, it's because of..
..cops like you that
the force is being slandered.
With so many years of experience..
..you still don't have brains?
That's not cocaine,
it's just sugar.
I said, sir? He says, yes,
this is just plain sugar!
I said, fine, sir, why don't you
drink it with your tea?
He says, no, I can't. I am diabetic.
I am your senior, when I crack
a joke you should laugh. Understand?
Shall I tickle you?
Come on Come on!
- Let us get a drink. Come on!
Platform number..
Papa, look, there!
- Come.
Why are we here?
- Come!
Come.
- Papa! No!
I'll not come.
- Come.
Come quickly, don't be afraid.
I am scared.
- Be careful! - Father.
Papa, come get me!
- O God!
Just put your foot here.
- Mother, come fast!
Mother. - Hey, be careful.
- Hold my hand.
Mother! - Come quickly,
what are you waiting for?
Hold my hand. - Yes.
- Mother! Come. Come..
Yes, that's it. that's it.
He has kept it so well.
Walk quietly.
It must be expensive, isn't it?
Come. - No.
- l' m telling you to come along.
Come, Come here, dear.
That one. That one.
Is this a good perfume?
Wait! Wait! Show me.
It's good. - Father, for me?
- It's a ladies' perfume.
Ladies? What perfume?
Do you want it, dear?
For me?
- Don't spray it on his face.
Take.
- He'll spray it on his face.
Excuse me. Do you want
to buy the perfume?
Buy it?
What?
Coffee. Do you have coffee perfume?
Coffee?
- Yes.
Coffee perfume?
- No.
It's very strong.
Come.
It's for 10,500 rupees.
O my God!
Not the entire stuff.
Just one bottle.
Sir, I am quoting the price of just one bottle.
1 0,500 rupees.
O my God!
- No.
Do people buy it?
Or is it just for show?
Everybody buys it, sir.
Only you spray it for free every day.
Tell me, sir. Do you want it?
If you have coffee perfume,
I will buy it. I like that.
This is very strong.
- Come! Let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Hey! Hey! Stop!
- Leave me!
Sir! Sir! Sir!
- What happened?
He is the same guy
I have told you about!
What did he do?
I have seen him many times.
He just comes here, sprays
perfume and then leaves.
Stop! Stop! I say stop!
Stop! Stop!
- Just keep walking.
Security!
Call the police!
Catch him! Security! Catch him!
Hey! Hey! Leave!
- Mother.
He has a wife.
Only son of his parents.
And now he can never write again.
He lost his right hand.
Oh God!
Shekhar, that guy is just 28, man.
And you are just 32.
You are still not scared.
You can afford it but you
don't want to buy a car.
Every day, you want to commute
only by train. Up and down!
Don't start again,
Shekhar! - Listen to me.
People can't wait to get
away from this country.
But you prefer to refuse any such..
..opportunities that come your way.
Because you want to
stay in this country..
..in India and reform it.
You are a big patriot.
What were we talking about
and what are you saying?
Tell me one thing, how much
income tax do you pay?
3 lakhs?
Has the government ever filled one..
..pothole on the road with that money?
Nikhil, what I am trying to say is..
..U.S, U.K present a far better lifestyle..
..there is security there.
So you go! Go to US, UK!
Where you will get
a good lifestyle and security.
You go!
Of course, I am going!
You can rot here forever!
Do one thing!
Till the next blast occurs keep
traveling in local trains!
Along with your wife. Fine!
And now you are going
to have a baby too!
Come on! Come on!
Listen to me! - Leave!
Papa!
- Come on!
First he used to come alone,
today he brings his family.
Tomorrow he might bring
his entire neighborhood.
Security!
If he is ever seen again then
file a police complaint! Fine!
It's okay!
- Papa!
Papa!
I will open the door.
Madam, I have come
from Mehta printers.
Here are your cards.
Sister! Are you alright?
Hello.
Who?
Yes, just a minute.
Suresh, there is a call for you.
You have to take it now.
Hello.
Yes.
I told you, I can't pay you right now.
You will get it when I have the money.
Have faith in me.
What?
What will you do?
Do what you want.
You will not get the money!
Do what you want!
Please don't hand me
any calls without asking.
And I will clear your bill soon.
Have I asked you for the money?
You haven't asked for it but
I can see it on your face, boss.
Will you have some tea?
Chhotu! Get tea for Suresh.
Take a seat.
Hello, sir.
- Hello.
Sir, did you find out
who did the bomb blast? - No.
Did you arrest anyone or not?
- Not yet, but soon.
Hurry up, sir.
It's been so many days since
the bomb blast and still no arrests?
Arrest somebody!
Get in! Come on!
- Sir? What have I done?
Should we arrest the ones
responsible for the bomb blast?
Yes, sir. - Or should
we arrest just anyone?
Sorry, sir.
- Then!
Sorry, sir! Sir!
- Leave! People!
The public just loves to pester us
with impossible problems.
Do you know what your problem is?
An art film plays
incessantly in your mind.
In black and white.
Watch the film, if you want,
but don't get involved in its act.
Find a nice corner seat in the theatre..
..of your mind and just watch.
Look at me, I have been
quietly watching this film..
..for the last 35 years.
Don't get involved!
You mean I should spend
the next 35 years like you?

Exact Salman! - "Your name.. "
Wonderful man!
One minute.
You really look like him!
He looks like him!
Excuse me!
- Yes!
Where did you buy the T-2hirt from?
City Centre.
- Thank you. Ok.
Hey Chhotu, take care.
Aamir Khan!
He really looks like Aamir Khan!
He should have been fair!
- We will apply limestone.
Enough!
Stop it! That's enough!
Suresh! Look!
We will meet later.
- Fine, bye.
Ok, bye. Come on!
He is the one!
- Come.. Come!
Why are you wasting your time?
You had followed him the other day.
Could you find anything?
- Not you, I'm telling him.
You're out of your mind.
They have a bike!
Will you chase him on foot?
Isn't he your friend?
Yes.
No!
Rickshaw!
Come on, quickly.
Brother, did you just see?
- What?
That man parked a scooter there
and went away in a rickshaw.
So?
He deserted his scooter!
I am coming!
I am coming!
You are so late!
- Sorry.
Sit!
Come on Suresh,
let us go back.
That girl is his girlfriend.
Quiet you fool! Do you have
a telescope in your hands?
How do you know
who is under the veil?
Look at her gait! - You know,
they learn to act like that!
Come on.
"O dear saint Haji Ali!"
Brother, do you want a photo taken?
- I don't want it.
Brother, one photo.
Why are you scared now?
- Happy!
Come on.
"O dear saint Haji Ali!"
Didn't I tell you it's a girl?
So?
Can't girls be terrorists?
Who killed Rajiv Gandhi?
What was her name?
Dhanu.
Wasn't she a girl?
Do you know who he was?
- No.
He was the prime minister!
I know that.
The blast that took place at the gateway.
Who was it in it?
That was a girl too.
Don't think, come on.
Hey, who did this to my scooter?
- Get away!
Hey, sir.
- Where are you going!
Inspector, my scooter?
- Get away! Come here!
Sir, who did this to my scooter?
Sir, who did this to my scooter?
Where did you go leaving it here?
Sir l.. - Why did you dash
off in the rickshaw?
Sir, listen to me. I am telling you.
My scooter broke down.
What is your name?
- My name is Ashok.
Where do you live?
- I live there.
Sir, it was an emergency,
that's why I left it here.
Show me your license!
- Sir, I will show you.
Here, is my license.
Sir, listen to me!
Who will assemble
my scooter back again?
That girl is in a veil.
Only her face is visible.
Why? What else do you want to see?
No, I mean..
They are like that.
They hide everything from the world.
We are the only ones
roaming around freely.
Suresh, how are you?
- Fine.
What are you doing these days?
The same computer business?
Yes. -Then I found you
at the right time.
These days I am working with them!
They need 50-60 computers promptly.
You will profit a lot.
Give me some commission too.
But it is a bit urgent.
Come and meet them quickly.
If someone else gets the order
then neither of us will benefit.
So are you surely going to do it?
Fine. I'll be waiting for you.
- Okay.
See you.
"Saint Haji Ali!"
Good, if not the terrorist but
you got some business.
I don't want to do any business
with these people.
Understood.
Come on! Earn while
you are getting a chance.
In life, you should adjust..
Don't teach me
what I should do in life.
Where did they go? - I don't know.
They were right here.
What were you doing?
- Sorry.
Listen, there are plastic bottles
and jars in this bag.
Use this table and
other furniture yourself..
..don't sell it a junk.
The city of Mumbai will
observe silence for 2 minutes..
..and pay homage to the deceased!..
..The public mourning shall..
'On this occasion..'
Anusha, are you studying or watching TV?
Come on, switch off the TV.
If you fail this time,
your father will lecture me.
Mom, look at the size of this book.
Do you think I can read
it in a day and pass?
It's impossible mama!
I'm going to fail.
Aren't you ashamed
to say such a thing?
Mom, I have an idea.
Let's call the college and tell them
there's a big bomb in the college!
The exams will be cancelled!
Don't be ridiculous!
- Mom, it can really happen.
Do you know what, everybody is
so scared of this train bomb blast!
Just the other day, someone
called Delhi and said..
..there is a very
big bomb near India Gate.
The entire bomb squad
had reached there.
But did they find anything there?
Nothing!
The entire station was
evacuated in minutes.
But they didn't find anything there too.
Mom, you have no idea what
can be done with a rupee?
Police station!
There's a bomb in a mall.
There's a bomb at Center One Mall.
It will explode in 10 minutes.
What happened, sir?
Rupali, I think you need
to come out of it..
..as soon as possible.
And the only way is to get
involved in something else.
We were thinking..
Anandita will explain it to you.
Rupali, we were thinking of
doing a half hour story..
..about you and Ajay. Since you
were reporting right there..
..when all this happened, so.
I know it's very unfortunate!
You know what I am trying to say.
Of course if you have any
objections we won't do it.
Here is a rough script. And.
Enough! That's enough Bhoite!
Sir, no excuses today. It's your
retirement party today, Mr. Patil!
You will have to drink!
If I drink so much,
I will retire from this world.
What are you saying, Sir?
May you live for a 100 years!
I'm getting old now.
Time for illnesses to creep in..
You won't be ill,
if you follow my advice.
Exercise every day, build a few
muscles and you'll be fine.
Assume that I start exercising.
- Okay.
And I attain the fitness of a body builder.
But there's a bomb under my chair.
Bomb! I don't know
that I'm sitting on a bomb!
I'm busy showing off my body to you.
I'm busy showing off my body to you.
And BOOM!
Post-retirement I'm off to my village.
- Really?
Lest a rogue builder seizes
my land for construction..
..I want to do lots of farming.
There is a thief there,
who comes every day.
Who is the thief? It's a fox.
Every night it eats up the sugarcane.
I want to catch it red-handed.
And put him in jail.
In the zoo!
The animal garden. - Zoo!
Then I might just feel some
sense of accomplishment.
Don't laugh, I'm serious.
I haven't caught a single terrorist.
Or a famous thief.
I haven't done anything great.
In fact I haven't done anything.
I never got the chance.
But you guys should do some good.
Don't just blabber like me.
Looking at your eyes I feel you
should go to the toilet now.
Bhoite!
- Yes.
Don't eat too much Chinese food.
- Why?
Your eyes will start slanting.
Kadam! Kadam!
Open the door!
Kadam.
- Kadam, open the door!
Break the door.
- Push!
Kadam, open the door!
Kadam! Kadam!
Kadam! Kadam!
Yes, Kadam!
Calm down.. It's ok!
Nikhil?
- Yes!
Get me some water please?
Yes!
Sorry, you had to get up.
No problem.
Acute stress disorder.
That's what it's called.
There is nothing to it..
It's very, very common.
It's nothing to worry, Nikhil.
It will phase out as time passes,
don't worry.
It's been 4 days, Sheila.
- I know it's been 4 days. I know.
Take this medicine. There are drops too.
Don't forget them.
And if possible, try and
avoid loud sounds. Okay?
Yes!
Nikhil, tell me something.
Your experience of the bomb blast..
..have you shared it with anybody?
Nikhil, its okay to be scared.
Yes.
There is absolutely no hurry!
Just completely relax.
If there is anything
you feel like changing..
..then just go ahead.. yes!
- Take it.
Thank you.
Ready!
- Close that curtain!
Roll!
Production ID 14, take 1!

An anonymous call made..
..to Raghuleela Mall situated in Kandivli..
..created a furor this afternoon.
The caller warned
the Mall authorities of..
..a possible explosive device
placed within its premises.
The entire mall was vacated..
..by the police and
searched thoroughly.
No explosives were found.
The police say, that after
a big terrorist activity..
..receiving such hoax calls is common.
These calls are made from
a public phone booth that's..
..why it is impossible to
find out who makes these calls.
The people that make such
calls don't realise that..
..they waste the time of the police..
..and the money of the people.
They are creating terror
amongst the people.
And in the ensuing furor,
anyone can lose their life.
After the 1 1th July bomb blast.
No one is ready to take a risk.
What is the matter?
..psychologists are trying to study..
Why are you crying?
Mumbai police has found that..
- What is the matter?
I..
..the psyche of pranksters
who make such hoax calls..
And this, right here..
is where we live.
Home sweet home. Nice, isn't it?
Hello.. Speaking.
Hey! How are you?
When did you arrive?
Vinod.
- Yes! Yes!
You're coming home, aren't you?
Let me talk to him.
Oh shut up, lost son of Bush.
What do you mean you are jetlagged?
Give me the phone.
- Just a minute.
Yes, talk to her.
- Vinod!
Hello Vinod.. Yes hello.
Just a minute,
I am not getting a signal!
I will go inside. Hello.
Yes, better now.
So, how was our flight?
It was so delayed.
So what time did you land then?
Yes!
How can we come to America?
He doesn't want to go to America.
No, no it is just a desire for us.
Yes! So..
Did Shweta and
Ishaan come along or not?
Very good, so when are you coming here?
Hello sir, how are you?
Come in, sir.. Have a seat..
Such a big man like you walking..
..the streets. It doesn't suit you, sir!
Come..
Come on.
Drive!
We are very fortunate
to be rubbing shoulders..
..with his eminence.
Who is he?
I don't know his name but
he is a very big man.
Sir, do you know what his name is?
Aadam Sheikh.
These people must really anger you.
If I were in your shoes,
I would've shot him.
The problem is that
I am not in your shoes.
Actually, I don't want
to be in your shoes.
Sawant, tell me something.
Suppose, you are on
a night shift and you spot..
..a man doing something wrong
and you stop him.
Now the man doesn't like it one bit!
He doesn't care that
you are a policeman.
..or that you are just doing your duty!
Instead he gets angry and
pushes you to the ground.
So?
So what will you do to him?
Tell me?
I'll beat him up all night
and break his bones.
It'll be difficult to distinguish
his femur from his skull.
That's our usual treatment..
Tell me something..
something different.
Different? Meaning?
Let's say, we didn't push him back.
Suppose we spare him.
- So?
This long-standing practice of
pushing each other will stop.
Yes.
- You didn't understand.
This is Aadam Sheikh, a Muslim.
And I am a Hindu,
Tukaram Patil.
Now suppose I push him.
And he pushes me back.
Then one Hindu stands by
my side in support.
And two Muslims stand by his side.
Four Hindus appear here,
eight Muslims there!
Hindus versus Muslims!
Everyone pushing each other.
It never stops.
It starts when you are young..
..and doesn't stop even
when you get old. Right?
I have grown old but I'm still
being pushed around.
I will retire soon.
But will you young men
think of finding a solution..
..for this game before you grow old?
Yes, of course.
Right?
Sir, what do you think?
Hey, we have wasted a lot..
..of the great man's time. Sorry sir!
Hey, stop the van!
Go. Goodnight, sir!
I am due to retire but our Kadam sir..
..will keep in touch with you.
Good night! Go.
Sorry uncle, we won't
do it again. We swear.
Please give us the ball.
Don't play cricket.
It's a colonial game.
Their cricket has brought
this ball on him.
Do you know what this is?
In the Mahabharat,
at Kurukshetra..
..Lord Krishna recited
the Gita to Arjun.
Lord Krishna says when morality is..
..in danger I take birth to destroy evil.
This 1 0,000 year..
..old knowledge is the gift of India.
Do you know how large
India was at that time?
Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,
Brahmadesh, Bhutan..
..Nepal, Pakistan,
Afghanistan were all..
..a part of ancient India.
It was all snatched away
and we did nothing.
But we're not cowards!
'Let's say, we didn't push him back.'
'Suppose we spare him.
'This long-standing..
..practice of pushing each
other will stop. - No.'
'You know what the biggest lie is?'
'That all religions are equal!'
'And everyone can live together.'
'Then one Hindu stands by
my side in support.'
'And two Muslims stand by his side.'
'4 Hindus appear here,
8 Muslims there!'
'Hindus versus Muslims!'
'Everyone pushing each other.'
'It starts when you are young
and doesn't stop..
..even when you get old.'
'Think of doing something different!'
We will observe until evening!
If everything is fine by the evening..
..then we will discharge him!
- Okay. - Okay?
What happened?
- Nothing! Come in.
Take care.
- Okay.
What did he say?
- Everything is fine.
There is nothing to worry about!
He will be discharged by evening.
By tickling my ears,
you will get better numbers.
Rupali Joshi, one of the youngest
and best T.V reporters.
You must have seen Rupali presenting..
..many amazing T.V news.
Rupali presented her best T.V report..
..when on the 26th of July..
- Mohit!
Rain wrecked havoc on
the metropolitan city of Mumbai.
Rupali bravely stood in the rain..
..and carried out her duty as a reporter.
And look, after a year there
are tears trickling down..
..Rupali's eyes. Presenting Rupali.
- The Unwed Widow!
But how?
On one side, reaching
new heights in her career, Rupali.
And on the other hand,
rising industrialist, Ajay Kumar.
Both loved each other a lot.
A wedding was planned
just two months later..
..on the second of October,
the birth anniversary..
..of the Father of the Nation,
Mahatma Gandhi.
Their engagement was very grand.
Beautiful wedding cards
were printed too.
On the morning of 1 1th July..
..they met, sharing a dreamy
breakfast with love.
But by the evening of
1 1th July, their dreams..
..plunged forever into darkness..
..when seven deadly blasts in
the Mumbai local trains..
..within eleven minutes.
As usual, Rupali was bravely reporting..
..from the blast site not
knowing that one of the..
..corpses around her
was of her husband, Ajay.
How did Ajay and Rupali
meet the first time!
We will see in a while.
What do you think?
After this terrible incident
that has occurred with her..
..will she be able to carry
out her role as the reporter..
..in the same manner, or not?
If your answer is a 'Yes',
Type Y RBR and if..
..your answer is a 'No' type
N RBR and SMS to 7776.
Don't forget to write your
name with your answer.
Keep watching only on T.V news.
Rupali-The Unwed Widow!
This is our kitchen.
Yes. - I want an identical kitchen, Nikhil.
Let's go then.
- Where to?
America! - America?
Hey that's great!
If you are really planning to come..
..Let me know so
I can apply for my leave.
Really! You must come there.
I promise, once you come there,
you will stay forever.
Oh! If only you had planned
this a little earlier.
Your delivery would
have been done there.
Just like Ishan,
your child would have been..
..an American citizen.
You mean, I will have to travel
to America to see my grandchild?
But I have rheumatic knees.
You don't have to walk to America.
Remember those days, Nikhil.
Of ticket less travels in the city bus.
And we were caught one day!
I do remember.
The local tea joint, the argument
of the neighbors..
..the Sunday afternoon cricket match.
I miss that!
Okay, now come on give me
a dance pose. Oh, lovely.
Anyways, everything
has changed here.
You know, these terrorists
and bomb blasts.
There are no guarantees
that a man who steps out..
..in the morning will return
safe and sound.
Which place in the world holds
such a guarantee, Nikhil?
Vinod, are you.. are you happy
with your life there?
I am good.
What more do you want from life?
My childhood ambition
was to go to America.
A big house, a big car,
a good lifestyle.
A healthy lifestyle.
I seem to have everything.
I work on Wall Street, the most
expensive street in the world.
After all, I live on paradise on earth.
But times are changing, Nikhil.
Two small planes shook the entire
country down to their roots.
Superpower!
The greatest security on the planet..
..could not protect the twin towers.
Previously tourists came
for the Twin Towers.
Now, they visit Ground Zero.
Every today you can see
someone crying there.
Even today, you see an
old woman carrying a wreath!
I think the next generation
will get used to all this..
..violence, bomb blasts.. bloodshed.
They will be used to
it since their childhood.
I think some children must
have heard about it..
..from their mother's womb.
It's never-ending Nikhil!
512 MB Ram, 80 GB hard disk,
keyboards, monitors..
..you will get everything original.
Hardware is fine but how
much for the software?
Nothing. It's for free.
I have it right here.
The Americans are rich
enough without our money..
But Suresh, all this should
be done in two days.
It will be done.
- Sure?
Sure!
Do you take cash?
Yes, of course.
Brother Feroze, I had told you
about it yesterday. - Yes.
Let's complete that
within two days too.
We will fix a meeting
whenever you say.
Call him on lunch tomorrow,
we will settle the matter there.
Our dear companion..
..Tukaram Patil retires from
active police duty today.
For the past 36 years,
he has served the department..
..at different police stations across the city.
Today is his last day of duty.
The ever-smiling Mr. Patil..
..has lowered the tension of..
..the people of the department.
Mr. Patil, your jokes and
humorous anecdotes..
..shall always be remembered.
On behalf of the Police Commissioner..
..senior officers and
the entire department.
I offer gratitude to Mr. Patil.
I also urge him to accept
this gift as a small token..
..of our gratitude and appreciation.
Hello, papa?
-Sejal is in labour.
We are taking her to Sanjivini Hospital.
You get there quickly.
- I'm coming..
Take Mr. Bhosle from
the first floor along with you..
Yes, yes, everyone is here.
You just come fast.
I am on my way..
I have to go to Andheri.
No sir, not there.
Please, it is very urgent.
No sir, there is too much traffic there.
My wife has been taken
to the hospital..
..she is going to have a baby.
It's necessary for me to go there.
Ok then. But it will take
at least an hour and half. - Yes.
An hour and half!
Why don't you take the train?
You will reach in just 20 minutes.
This is sir's money.
Come on, take it.
Listen. And this is for you.
- No!
Keep it, boy! Enjoy yourself!
- Thank you.
He gave this to me.
And a tea..
Brother Musa, how are you?
Yusuf.. how are you? - Good.
-Business seems to be good.
Now our beloved Mr. Patil
will say a few words.
No. No.
- Come on, speak up.
Patil sir, speak.
Speak!
I'm a small man from
a small village.
I was born in 1948.
My father would say,
Tukya I wanted to carry you..
..to the Red Fort in Delhi for..
..the celebration of independence..
But you fool,
you were born a year late.
I would say, father that's your fault.
My parents were illiterate.
But they sent me to school so I could..
..read and write. Well, I learnt
only how to read and write.
Today is my day of retirement so I shall..
..make a small confession..
I stole my teacher's spectacles.
I was thrown out of the school.
I don't know why, I always
had a fascination for specs.
As a child I felt that spectacles..
..allowed a man to see things far away.
When I finally got my glasses..
..I realized that far-2ightedness..
..was a virtue that required
a different perspective..
..which I was not capable of..
When they threw me out of school..
..my father said,
Tukya, you are a thief!
And when you grow up,
you shall become a bigger thief!
So when he heard that
the police force was recruiting..
..he said, Tukya, get out of here,
join the police force.
Around the same time..
..the mill where my father
worked went on strike.
It never ended.
Relying on the words
of the union leader..
..my father died!
He died and the mill got sold.
Today, a big, posh mall
stands in its place.
But whenever I see
a poor man in that mall..
I feel the strike and
the strife never ended for him..
Today my wife says to me..
..you've been serving
the police force for 36 years.
Today, when you retire,
ask your boss to show..
..your interview on the T.V.
why?
She says, these days they
interview anyone on the TV.
So what's wrong with you?
I said, no dear,
I don't want publicity.
I only want to do my duty.
That's all!
These days,
the trains are so crowded!
I suddenly realized it only today.
In the old days, the local
trains were never so crowded.
The younger generation
would never believe that..
..Mumbai was a clean and quiet city.
The city had no tensions.
My wife and I used to..
..regularly go to the airport
for our evening stroll.
And I've seen a plane
from such a close distance.
Yes, close enough to touch!
No need for security.
No checks. No fear.
No Hindu-Muslim riots or
communal tension. Nothing!
Children used to happily
enjoy fire crackers..
..during the festival of light.
Wonder who renamed these
crackers as atom bombs?
Do you know how
Mumbai came into existence?
There were seven smaller pieces of land.
They were brought together
and Mumbai was born.
The day when seven bombs exploded..
..in the trains,
I wondered, will it shatter..
..and divide Mumbai in seven parts again?
I looked into the mirror and said..
Tukya..
..you have become a philosophizing poet.
And that too in a police uniform.
I won't be wearing this uniform tomorrow.
I won't come to work either.
But I'll pray to God that in my next birth..
..if He decides to make me
a policeman again..
..I will dedicate my life
with complete integrity..
..to something real good.
There's some problem.. And I will
also pray that we are successful..
..in nabbing the ones responsible
for the bomb blasts.
I shall conclude here lest
I break out into tears.
And crying in a police
uniform is not allowed..
..so I think I need to go to the toilet.
So, Kadam?
I was just telling the boss..
..to end your suspension soon.
I told him that you are a good man..
..and even good people make mistakes..
He said he'll look into it.
Patil sir! Patil sir! Patil sir! Patil sir!
Forgive me!
Forgive me..
Can you pass me
the match box, please!
Will you have tea? Guddu!
Two cups of special tea!
I.. I don't want tea.
Now that I've ordered it, have some.
Oshiwara?
- No. - Come on.
Rickshaw.. Rickshaw..
Give me a rose.. Quick!
- Rs.5!
Taxi..
Taxi..
Rickshaw..
Come on!
Nice song!
Aamir Khan has performed so well.
"The mud of my country..
"The mud of my country..
Do you have faith in Sai Baba?
..is so fragrant."
Yes.
These are Baba's holy offerings.
I was in Shirdi,
these past few days.
When Baba's call knocks
at my heart, I have to go.
Here is a photo of Baba with
a calendar at the back.
Keep these offerings and have faith.
Thank you.
Taxi..
Let's go to that side.
Let's wait for some time,
then we will go. - Yes, fine.
Stop. Stop here.
Here.. your.. your taxi!
Carefully!
Oshiwara!
I deal in computers!
Business is down these days.
I have received a few orders,
let's see what happens.
What do you do?
I have an A/C..
Sit here.
- Hey Manya, come.
Yusuf, this is Manya.
- Hi. - Hi.
We lovingly call him fool!
Why?
This is Ashok.
How are you?
- Fine.
And this is Jhandu.
- Hi.
How are you? Come,
come, sit down. - Thanks.
Move.. See his size!
- Shut up!
Hey guys, I just received
a new sound clip.
It is hilarious!
You will laugh to death! Come.
I will take the bikes!
Let this get down first! Okay.
I still remember that sound clip..
..the one with Sunny Deol's voice.
Hey guys, stand up!
- Why?! What happened?
Don't you remember?
See the time.
What is happening?
Why has the train stopped suddenly?
Did something happen again?
It's nothing.
Last week at this time..
..the bomb blasts took place..
They are paying homage by maintaining..
..a two minute silence.
See, people are stopping there.
Hey there, stop!
I.. I haven't done anything, sir!
- Quiet! Just stand still!
It is not my fault, sir!
- Shut up.
sir, I will apologize.
Just stand quietly!
-Just stand quietly!
Sorry, sir! Sorry, sir!
Quiet!
