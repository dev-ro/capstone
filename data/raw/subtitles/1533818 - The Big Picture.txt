He hit his head!
- It's nothing... What were you saying?
- Nothing.
- That's a "nice" way of greeting me...
- I'm not your enemy.
I don't want to talk about that now.
Of course not.
As usual, you're breaking off.
Another time. Not now.
- Is everything ok?
- Yes.
What are your plans for today?
Nothing special.
I am having lunch with Clarisse.
Send her my regards.
Do you want me to take Hugo today?
Today is Wednesday.
- Ya, you're right!
- Wednesday, I take him.
- Bye, dad.
- See you later. Promise you'll behave, ok?
THE BIG PICTURE
-Good morning.
- Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, boss.
Valéry.
I know what they said.
I'm only here so they'd stop being in my face.
So, be quick with your little moral lesson,
because I'm not really in the mood.
Your parents say you spend 18 hours a day
playing games on the Internet.
Whatever I did, I stopped six month ago.
But your parents are not
very happy with your behaviour.
Mainly because in the last two years
you lost 87 million euros.
They would like for you to agree
to see some professional help
who would help you get rid of
this little habit.
Like a shrink or what?
So?
What do you do all the time on your computer?
I edit photos and sell them on the Internet.
That's why I'm always at the computer.
- Can I see?
- See what?
- Your work, now.
- Ok. I have nothing to lose...
Anyway, if they keep
annoying me, I'm leaving.
- And what are you going to do?
- For now, live my life.
Live your life? What do you mean?
I mean, not their life, not your life,
but my own life.
Perfect. Your father agrees with you.
- With what?
- With you leaving home, living your life.
I'll pretend I believe that.
But your laptop stays here.
And your credit card.
It's your problem how you're going to live.
Look, my father couldn't have said that.
You thought he hired me to talk about Photoshop?
Go speak to Dr. Kotchek.
- Can I go now?
- You are "free", Valéry.
- How did things go with the young heir?
- Very well. I think he will give in.
Perfect.
How did you do that?
I did what my father used to do when
I was 20. It was easy.
- But that boy has talent.
- Yes, he has. And he can't lose that.
Ha, Ha! My father used to say the same thing.
And look at me know!
- Should I pity you?
- Wait, it's not that.
- Don't be so upset!
Look, nobody cares about that boy.
Nobody knows who he is. People take
decisions for him. They run over him.
Nobody has any pity because he is rich.
- Clarisse!
- Hello, Paul!
Good morning! Sorry, I am in a hurry.
I have an appointment with Marquei
and I don't want him to wait for me.
- See you soon! Give a hug to Sarah for me!
- Bye.
A friend.
I'm just going to make a phone call.
See you inside.
Sarah, it's me... Call me back, yes?
- Was that Sarah? Is she ok?
- Yes, she's very well.
Did I tell you that I bought the last
Canon EOS model with all the lenses?
It cost me a fortune, but just
looking at it makes me giddy.
You have to come see the
lab I have in the basement.
- And the garden? You said you were to redo it.
-I will.
We focused on the house first.
- What about the house? Do you like it?
- The house is great!
Honestly, we couldn’t have found
a better place for the kids!
And if one day we start missing
Paris, we can always sell it.
-I don’t know how you did it.
-Anyway, it wasn’t really my decision.
That’s bull!
I don’t know how you gave up to that city,
the cafés open all the time, the pollution?
What do you mean give up?
I don’t see what the problem is.
- I’m not giving up anything. I don’t get it.
-I am only teasing you...
No, wait, that’s exactly the point.
There are certain moments... We have priorities.
We chose this city for the kids.
And, yes, everything had changed... Luckily.
It would be pathetic, if not for the children.
OK, we have less things, less time...
Hey, I’m not Sarah, ok?
Sorry.
But it’s a delicate matter.
Why don’t you take Sarah on a little trip?
You can take some days off...
No, I can’t.
I have to take care of Vilmont’s case, and...
- I can’t.
- You take care of everything when you come back.
Afterwards, you’ll work thrice as much because
I won’t be here anymore.
- I... will talk to her.
- It’s important.
And you? Where are you going to be?
- Dead.
- Wait... you got me there for a moment.
I’m dying, Paul.
Stop that...
- I can’t believe there’s nothing you can do.
- Anyway, I don’t want to do anything.
It’s my decision.
And you have to accept it.
You also have to get used to the idea
that you're going to be head of the firm, Paul.
I want things to run smoothly after.
I am going to put my shares in your name...
for nothing, of course.
This has nothing to do with my relationship
with your parents. It’s you I'm talking to now.
I don’t have any sons and I want to take full
advantage of the time I still have with Jacques.
I am already missing you.
But at least, your future is certain.
Now, the ball is in your court.
What do you think about all this, Paul?
- Paul?
- Fine... I don’t know, I...
I don’t know what to say. I’m sorry.
- Go ahead, answer!
- No! It’s Sarah.
Hello... now?
- And the meeting in Rue du Charron?
- It’s only a property.
Wait... Ok, I’m coming.
You know, the worst moment was when I realized
I have no future... No more choices to make...
You don’t want me to stay with you?
- You know, it’s not my funeral, Paul.
- Come on, stop that.
- What happened?
- Look.
- What can I get you?
- I don’t know. I’m not thirsty. A coffee, please.
Relax, Paul.
OK. I’m listening.
That’s a very nice scarf...
Paul, it’s over.
I decided to stop writing, to stop lying
to myself... I can’t do it anymore.
I am tired of writing for all those magazines.
I feel that I will find the thing that
I like to do elsewhere.
I could find a job... Earn my living...
- What do you think?
- Yes...
Couldn’t you have told me that last night?
- I could have...
- No, no, you did well...
Sorry.
I... I was afraid that...
- You were thinking that...
- That?
- It was something more serious.
- No, it’s nothing serious.
It’s just me, it’s just my life.
And of course it’s important, Paul.
I tell you to come here...
- You ruin everything, everything. Always...
- Wait... Don’t...
Wait! Sarah, wait! It’s not fair!
I always supported you...
In this case, yes, I am guilty.
It was I that told you to quit your job and write.
I always believed in Your talent.
I work my a** off to give you that freedom!
Have faith in you!
I want you to be successful, to get to...
No, no, Paul. You made me give up everything
so I would stay at home.
And you made me live in a bubble.
So I would fail.
Because losers love losers. That’s what happened.
This is the truth.
Wait, wait! You went too far!
What are you saying?
Ok, I’m sorry. I didn’t take it well and I understand...
After the lunch I had today, it was difficult...
I couldn’t care less about your lunch, Paul.
Sarah, wait!
There is another man. Is that it?
That would be easier, no?
- You didn’t go to lunch with Clarisse.
- She cancelled at the last moment.
- We’ll talk tonight?
- Things aren't going well, Paul... We can’t continue...
- See you tonight?
- No, I am going with Nathalie to the theatre.
I didn’t know... You didn’t tell me anything.
- We’ll talk after, then.
- See you tonight.
Anne, it’s me.
Nothing special.
I was thinking about you.
Kiss. See you tomorrow.
- How are you?
- Great. And you?
- How was it?
- Very bad.
- Really bad actors.
- Ah, and? Who were the actors?
You wouldn’t know them.
But I was happy to see Nathalie.
- Do you want anything to drink?
- I’m in.
- Stay there, I’ll do it.
-We didn’t do that for centuries.
I loved it when you would get drunk and
say things off the top of your head. Kissing...
- Off the top of my head?
- Ya. What’s the name of the wine?
- Cloudy Bay.
- From New Zealand.
It doesn’t have a cork...
It’s good. Really good!
- Where did you find it?
- In the cellar of Chez Gérard in Bastille.
- At Chez Gérard in Bastille? Do you often go there?
- Yes.
One time I even went to the Eiffel Tower.
- Ha! Ha! At the Eiffel Tower?
- Yes.
Hello, Gérard?
Yes, it’s Paul Exben... Very well, thank you.
Can you send me two boxes
of Pomerol like the last time?
And two boxes of Cloudy Bay.
Cloudy Bay?
I was thinking...
No, don’t worry. It’s my fault.
Thank you. See you later.
Hello! Daddy is home!
- Hello, baby boy! Everything is fine?
- Yes.
- Hello, Fiona. How are you?
- Daddy, you didn’t go to work?
- Is Sarah home?
- No, not yet.
- Daddy, you didn’t go to work?
- No, today I skipped it.
-But don’t tell anyone, ok?
- Ok.
- I’ll be back in a minute.
Swim, Hugo, like a fish.
What’s going on here?
- Look, I have my pirate shorts!
- Mom bought them for me.
- They’re great!
- Come, daddy!
- Okay.
You didn’t take your shoes off!
Do you also want to take a bath?
The fishes swim, swim, swim...
Swim, swim, swim
The fishes swim in the water
just like fishes!
Look, mom is coming!
Mom is coming.
Did she came?
- Where is she?
- There.
Come, let’s get ready.
Let me arrange my hair... Ah!
- You look so nice with this hairdo!
- You’re home!
I am. I came to be with the children. And you.
Everybody will see I am wearing a pyjama.
- And? Nobody can tell.
- No! Some people can!
- Then I will buy a pyjama and I won’t even tell!
- No...
This way she won’t be the only one in pyjama.
Look... she’s crying...
Let’s go home.
- Wait just a second... I have to go in.
Wait a second.
- Hi, neighbour! Spending some money?
- Hi.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Exben.
- Sarah.
We are waiting for you there, ok?
Well... Ok.
-"Evidence" by Avedon?
- Do you know it?
It’s a reference work,
At least for us.
The first time I saw it, I was so impressed
that for three days, I couldn’t touch my camera.
And then I told myself: Even though I regret it,
I have to give in to the obvious. I’m not a genius.
- It happens...
- Why don’t you come by these days to talk photography?
- Sure... Why not?
- Good evening, then. Bye.
Bye.
What an arrogant!
- Be careful, Hugo!
- What happened?
It’s his face! He seems so full of himself!
- What an irritating face!
Stop it... It’s not that big of a deal.
I can’t explain it, it makes my skin crawl!
It’s like with jogging. What an idiot!
- And the shoes, did you like them?
- Yes, I did.
Listen, dad! I am already wearing a 29!
29? That’s huge!
- It was nice, yesterday.
- It was.
- It was good for us.
- What? The drink?
- No. Just being together.
- Yes.
- Then, tell me that.
- What?
- That it was good.
- Ah, yes.
- That is...
- That’s right...
Did you know that the garbage tracks now come
on Tuesdays instead of Mondays? Isn’t that absurd?
- Do you really want to talk about garbage?
- Let’s drink some wine.
Why is she making such a case out
Of this garbage issue?
- This whiskey of yours tastes like medicine, as always!
- Come on, it’s a good brand.
- Sarah, how are the children?
- Very well. But Baptiste wakes up a lot at night.
- How old is he?
- 9 month.
He still does peepee, poor baby...
He cries so hard I’m afraid he will choke.
How can you say something like that?
Because that’s how I feel.
He’s not a quiet child.
- You can’t say that.
- Of course I can! I don’t mind saying it.
I love him, of course,
but I don’t know if I like him.
- You’re saying horrible things!
- No, there’s nothing horrible.
It’s ok for a person to wonder if he likes his children,
If he loves them the way he should... There’s nothing horrible...
Sorry, this is our problem,
Not yours.
Don’t worry.
I don’t think it’s absurd for someone
to ask himself questions about the love he feels.
And you, Grégoire? Are you working a lot?
I am waiting an answer from National Geographic.
It’s a feature. It’s about an issue
I’ve been following for a long time.
The prisons in Hungary.
- Are you the one who suggests the subjects?!
I thought it was the other way around.
Next to the bottle of La Valette...
Did you see?
- Sauvignon Blanc, Cloudy Bay.
- I don’t know it.
He says it’s very good.
It’s the joy of working...
Should we start with dinner?
With pleasure.
- Do you know what I prepared for starters?
- No.
- Do you want a drink?
- Oh... yes.
Next to Sarah... And you on the other side...
It’s a question of will.
But on the other hand,
Work also grabs you.
No. I can come and go whenever I want.
- It’s just an illusion.
- No illusion. For me, it’s a possibility.
- I always say that...
- It' weird to hear someone starting with "I always say"!
- What?
- It’s bulls***...
It would be more interesting
if you were starting with "I rarely say".
For... sure.
- What?
- What’s the problem?
Did I say something wrong?
Ha! Ha! Yes!
I’m talking about semantics. Or I can't talk about it?
- OK, you’re right.
Wait, I know why.
It’s because it makes you think about literature.
- And now talking about literature is obsolete.
- Stop, that’s enough...
- Paul...
- Pom! Pom! Pom! Pom!
- Paul... Paul...
- What are we going to do now?
Paul?
I am all ears, Sarah... Bovary.
- Don’t go. He’s drunk.
- You think?
Did she leave?
- Well... It’s late. I’m going... Thank you.
- I’ll come also.
Let’s all go then...
- No, not yet...
- Good night, Paul.
Such a pity, because the vibe
Was so great.
- I hope so... See you soon.
- Bye.
- Are you already up?
- For two hours.
I...
- I’m really sorry for yesterday.
- It’s ok. Don’t worry about us.
You should apologize to Sarah.
I live my life saying sorry.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Hugo?
I WANT A DIVORCE. I WILL BE AT MY SISTER’S
WITH THE CHILDREN UNTIL YOU TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTIONS.
Lucie, it’s Paul. I want to talk to Sarah, please.
No... That’s a lie. Get her on the phone.
Get her... Where is she? I need to talk to her.
Get her on the phone!
Get her on the phone!
Paul...
Your door was open.
We could have our chat about photography now...
- Are you awake?
- I’m fine.
Come in then.
- Did you decorate?
No, my parents. I know that it’s out of fashion,
but it’s the only thing that proved they lived.
I got used to it.
Do you feel worse in a 400 sq m apartment
In Le Vesinet than here with your memories, don’t you?
I have to warn you,
I only have basic things in here.
Not at all flashy, for sure.
Nothing like the digital equipment of Paul Exben.
I don’t remember showing you my set-up.
That doesn’t mean that I not aware of it.
Sorry.
Hello.
Imagine!...
At least that...
Wait... I can’t really talk right now...
In half an hour? Ha! Ha! No...
I’ll tell you... I’ll tell you later... Ha! Ha!
It’s not the best of time.
OK, talk to you later.
So, am I right or what?
Don’t you have a state-of-the-art computer,
A high definition printer and all that?
I do.
- Since when?
- Since when what?
Sarah and I?
A few weeks, I think...
I don’t know exactly.
The date and hour... I couldn’t tell you.
And... the...
What? What we do when we're alone,
is that what you want to know?
Everything you could imagine, more or less.
But you should know, I have
No intention of marrying her.
I could never afford to give her
the status and lifestyle of Paul Exben.
So, why did you come here?
To make me feel ashamed?
What do you want? Talking about it?
Do you want to come to an agreement?
Share her?
I have nothing against that...
Why wouldn’t we be modern about it?
- This stops here...
- Exactly. You’re right...
... now go home and wait for that to happen.
Do you know what she can’t stand about you?
That you hate yourself.
And the height of your victimising yourself!
It’s all your fault... That’s why
you never succeeded with your photography.
- And you? Did you succeed?
- No. But I realized that and I didn’t give up.
Shut up! You are a loser.
And you are a success. Poor thing!
The only thing you do is make money...
While another man f***s your wife...
Ah!
- Hello?
- It’s Sarah.
The telephone was off... I thought you weren't in.
No, I was here.
Paul, I know you tried to talk to me...
Listen. I’m sorry, but I think we talked enough.
Then, why are you talking?
Since I’m staying with Lucie the whole week,
I gave the week off to Fiona.
But I come back on Sunday,
And I think it would be better
if you were not there anymore.
I want to see the children.
I will never forbid you to see them...
- Is that ok?
- It is.
Come pick-up Hugo on Wednesday. Set up an hour,
We want to go to the Quai Branly Museum.
- It’s ok?
- OK.
See you on Wednesday. Bye.
- How was the reunion?
- It was postponed to tomorrow... Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning, boss... She's in the conference room.
- Thank you, Estelle.
- How are you?
- Sarah wants a divorce.
- No! How are you?
- OK. At least I think so.
WERE ARE YOU? BECAUSE...
GREG, BABY, I AM FREE TOMORROW FROM 2 TO 4.
NOW I CAN’T,
HE WILL BE HOME SOON.
SARAH, BABY, A GREAT NEWS:
I AM GOING TO HUNGARY.
THEY WANT ME TO COME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
I HAVE TO GO.
I COME BACK IN 2-3 WEEKS.
I LOVE YOU, GREG.
WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT ACCEPT YOUR PROJECT
SINCE AN ARTICLE ON THE SAME SUBJECT WAS ALREADY
DECIDED TO BE FEATURED IN OUR MAGAZINE.
LOST PASSAPORT DECLARATION
THE LITTLE ANARCHIST
WHO WANTED TO BUILD A BOMB
-Hello.
- Greg? Before you hung up... My love, I am...
How are you? Hello?
Greg? Are you hearing me?
Wait. I can’t hear anything.
I miss you.
I’ll call you later.
Daddy!
My baby! How are you? Did you like it?
I did! There was an Indian man
with an enormous head!
- Uau!
- Good morning.
- Are you hungry?
- I am.
Let’s go eat some Chinese, shall we?
- Ah! Can I?
- Of course.
- Ah, my little pickle...
- I also want to give him a kiss.
It makes a funny noise...
- Hear? Doesn’t it make a funny noise?
- It funny, isn’t it?
- Baptiste is fine?
- Yes.
Last night he slept
almost 6 hours without waking up.
- Dad, I want a milk shake.
- No, you know that mom doesn’t let you.
- But I really want to drink one!
- Wait. We’ll see, son.
Hugo. Hugo, listen!
Noé is calling you!
I’m coming!
Paul, this isn’t easy for me either,
But I’m not going back.
We need to be organized
and be smart about it.
For the sake of our children and ours too.
Everything will be alright, I swear.
I’m sure one way or the other,
Things will work out.
How great!
He didn’t call me!
I didn’t hear anything!
- He is there... Go! Go!
- I’m coming, Hugo...
- Go, honey!
- I’m coming, Hugo...
Go, I’ll be right behind you, Hugo.
- Come, son.
The little fish
swim, swim, swim, swim, swim...
Sunday is fine.
I can come back, I am going to La Trinité.
- I leave tonight.
- Ah, perfect... Thank you... It’s fine...
Is everything ok, honey?
You didn’t talk to me like that in a while.
Everything is fine. I am a little
shaken, but I’m fine.
I saw a man... who was doing like this...
Come and show me.
Where?
See you.
See you.
- Now you can go...
- I want to go between those two.
Great. Try it.
Come, son. You got out of the seat belt all alone?
Come, then.
Wait. Wait there.
- Here... Have fun, ok?
- Ok.
- Daddy, you are not coming with me?
- No.
You know, Hugo, I...
Nothing... Give me a kiss.
- Go... Enjoy, ok?
- I am going on a boat...
I have to leave. You go now... Have fun!
You also have fun, daddy.
I don’t know how I will manage...
It’s so heavy!
How nice! Show it to me!
Heavy, right?
Push, you can do it alone...
Please, check the information before you sign.
Damn! Damn it!
- Sorry! Sorry!
- Son of a b****!
Damn!
- The family says hi.
- And?
You’re shaking! Are you cold?
Do you want to go inside the car?
- Are you ok?
- Yes, I am...
I am not going to take charge of the firm.
I’m sorry. I thought I would,
but now I know I can’t handle it.
Stop joking, Paul.
You know what’s at stake here...
I know what a great opportunity you offered me.
I am really thankful.
But I will never take charge of the firm.
I am sure... I don’t want to lie to you.
Then, let’s bury it right now...
You were a beautiful adventure for me, Paul.
I officially declare...
the death of the firm EBF Office,
Do to the disappearance...
of its founder and her associate,
Anne Damaso e Paul Exben.
You can make some good money out of its sale...
So Sarah and the kids won’t have to worry.
Good luck.
Dear Paul,
I hope you arrived safe and sound.
Gaël took care of the boat like you asked.
He put the fuel tanks downstairs.
Enjoy. A big hug from everybody.
See you when you come back.
Kisses, Yvette.
FRIENDS: I'LL BE DOING A FEATURE IN HUNGARY FOR THE NEXT 2 MONTH OR SO.
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TALK ON THE PHONE, BUT I CAN E-MAIL. GREG.
Paul, is that you?
Gaël told me you were coming. But I didn’t know that
You wanted to sail out so fast.
- Hi, Erwan.
- Hi.
- It was time you came to take in some fresh air.
- Yes.
- Sarah and the kids are fine?
- Yes, they stayed in Paris.
- Ah... And the boat?
- It’s great.
- Do you want me to help you...
- No! I’m fine, Erwan. Thank you.
- Ok, if you need anything you know where to find me.
- OK.
- Bye, Paul. Strong winds!
- Ok, Erwan... Bye.
Passport.
- OK.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Excuse me.
A room, please.
Greg...
Paul died.
Disappeared along with his father’s boat.
Police are investigating.
They asked hundreds of questions about our marriage.
If things were ok between me and Paul.
It was horrible. I...
They decided it was an accident.
So, that was all.
Nothing more than an... accident.
Tourists won’t bother you.
Not in summer and not in winter.
It’s 100 euros a month.
And 10% more the agency’s fee.
But he doesn’t want to rent
for less than 6 month. OK?
OK.
Hello.
SARAH, IT’S PAUL. I CAN’T IMAGINE HOW SHOCKED
YOU WILL BE WHEN READING THIS.
THE DAY YOU LEFT, I WENT TO GREG’S HOUSE.
I KILLED HIM. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO.
I HAD LOST YOU. I DECIDED TO DISAPPEAR FOREVER...
... AND BE DEAD FOR YOU. THE FATHER OF
OUR CHILDREN DIED.
IT WAS THE ONLY THING I COULD DO TO PREVENT
THEM FROM HAVING A MURDERER FOR A FATHER.
Hello! Do you know where I can find
a Durst enlarger? Or...
- How much do you want to spend?
- 500.
I have an Axomat 4. It's second hand,
but in very good condition.
- Ok! Lens?
- 50 and 85.
But I can show it to you.
- Oh yes, please!
- Here it is.
- The objective.
- It's ok!
I'll take it.
- Ok!
Is photography your hobby?
- No, I get paid for it.
- That's what I thought.
- This will be 470 euros. Ok?
- Ok!
- We accept credit cards if you want.
- No no, I prefer cash.
- You know, we have an amateur photographers' club here
and we get together twice a month,
so it will be great if you could come
and talk about your work.
- Sure, with pleasure.
- But I'm very busy right now.
So, in a month or two?
- Excellent! Can you just tell me your name, please?
- Kremer
My husband.
He is a movie star. Look!
Ah, here you are... Are you French?
You found a great place to hide.
- How do you know I’m French?
- Well... It’s a small city... you know how it is...
Bartholomé.
62 years old, single,
very attached to the country that adopted me.
- What else can I say?
- Well, it’s already a lot...
And I haven’t still told
You about my ex-wives.
Where there a lot?
- Three. What about you?
- None.
- You’re lying! You were never married?
- No.
You are an exception to the rule.
That means you can only be from Paris.
Or you are gay...
- I was joking. You didn’t mind me calling you gay, right?
- I don’t mind...
I can’t say it was very elegant,
But I’m not mad.
Then, I’m not in my best shape,
Because people always get mad when I ask them that.
I’m not very drunk... Linda!
I am very fond of little Linda.
Wait...!
I cannot go home like this.
I am a rag!
After the next curve, I’m dead!
Let’s take a taxi then.
A taxi?
Here?
If not, we will call a helicopter...
-... helicopter.
- Come.
- Do you have a sofa?
- What?
If you have a sofa, you have a guest.
- If you offer me a nightcap, I won’t talk until tomorrow.
- Of course.
This is not bad.
- You are a photographer...
- I am.
- You are a joker...
- Why do you say that?
Because we've been drinking for the last 5 hours
And I don’t know anything about you.
And that’s my answer... Good night.
Grégoire Kremer?
- Yes!
- Follow me!
- You know him?
- Yes.
He give us your address.
- He say he lives here, yes?
- Yes.
Yes, yes..
Ok, ok, we'll leave him with you..
OK.
- This is yours?
- Yes.
- You're French?
- Yes.
You have the vehicle's documents?
Bartholomé?
Grégoire Kremer?
- Yes...
- Sorry to bother you.
- I was just leaving.
- My name is Ivana Levkovitz...
I am the Kotor’s editor-in-chief of photography
for the newspaper in Belgrade.
I work with Bartholomé.
- You met him yesterday, didn’t you?
- Yes.
He must have said he is
our editor-in-chief, right?
- No.
- Ah, ok then.
I decided to call because he left some photos
that you took when he came in this morning.
I took a look at the photos
And they are really very interesting.
But... I think we could talk more if we met.
-Ok.
- Tomorrow at noon, in Kotor’s office?
- Yes.
- Ok, see you tomorrow.
- Ivana. Nice to meet you.
- Grégoire Kremer.
Are we going?
Bartholomé’s office is there.
Sometimes he sleeps there.
He didn’t say he was a journalist.
He is actually very popular.
His articles are quite read here.
Welcome to the photo stock room. Sit down.
Sorry for the mess, but I can’t work any other way.
This meeting is a real pleasure for me.
It was a stroke of luck you coming to Korgot.
How did you end up here?
I love this country, but a professional like you
Should be living in Paris or New York, don’t you think?
Yes, I lived in Paris, but it didn’t work.
I was tired of shooting weddings
And I decided to try my luck in another place.
I understand.
Thank you for your sincerity.
People only talk about the advantages...
Especially in the first interview.
- I am hungry. How about you?
- I am too.
So, this is my idea... and I don’t have
Any doubt that Belgrade will endorse this.
Our paper give great weight to the iconography.
We work with photographers from all over Europe.
I'd like to publish a series with your photos
In the weekend edition.
The first series would go for six weeks.
We can give you 100 Euros per photo.
- But that’s nothing!
- I know these are not the fees in Paris,
- Why do you speak French so well?
- Because I do.
Sorry to have interrupted you...
Come in.
I was thinking it was
the secretary wearing thongs.
- What do you want?
- I don’t know... I am undecided.
I don’t know whether to be mad
or say thank you.
I don’t know...
I opened some doors for you...
You owe me total loyalty.
I want your friendship,
your constant company,
And that you pay my bill at the bar...
That’s all.
- I will be very busy with work.
- I will pretend I didn’t hear that.
I saw on the net the photos you did in Paris.
I did well to recommend you, didn’t I?
You know, you don’t look like an heir.
I lost my parents when I was 22 years old.
They left me a house with a big greenhouse
that We used to grow vegetables.
You can go back whenever you want then.
Or can’t you?
I can.
Why did you leave without taking anything?
I don’t understand.
I don’t know... Why is your house so empty?
You have nothing of yours there. No photos, no alarm clock,
And you know what? Not even a piece of luggage.
Yes. And?
Well... Nothing.
Wait. Don’t leave any tip.
The guy is an idiot.
- Do you know him?
- Yes. He’s my brother.
- You’re joking!
- No, it’s true.
Did you have a fight?
No. I just don’t speak with him.
He's an a**hole.
OK, photo? OK?
Don’t you want to do an exhibition?
Funny... You seem like you don’t trust your work.
No, I’m just very safe.
We always have things to take care of
about the material features and so on...
So, we need to stay in touch...
Don’t worry.
I will call only in cases of emergency.
Ok. Thank you.
- Here... What type of flash did you use?
- No flash.
- I took advantage of the natural light.
- Ah, nice.
- I was lucky...
- Luck doesn’t exist. Luck has nothing to do with it.
-We can begin with this one.
- Let me see...
Very good.
- No, Greg, please!
I don't want my picture in the newspaper.
My parents will think
that I work at the White House!
- Mmmm... this is very delicious!
Okay: We are... very... happy... to have... you... here!
No, I never married. I didn’t feel like it.
But in Paris I had a thing with a married woman.
- That’s sounds a little complicated...
- Yes, it didn’t work.
Did her husband find out?
If you want to know the truth, he was a lawyer.
He was very tired of the life he was leading.
But he was pretending everything was fine.
The only thing he knew was that
He wanted to be a photographer.
But he never had the courage
to take it to the next level.
If only you saw the photo lab he had in his house!
He had everything. Everything!
But she still wanted you, didn’t she?
The real photographer.
Yes.
Yes.
Hold still.
Ivana.
Ivana... Hold... Wait!
I've been following your work for some time.
I didn't contact you tight away.
When did you start
publishing your portraits?
- Three months ago, more or less...
- More, wasn't it?
Anyway it doesn't matter. I was let down
by a sculptor who was due to exhibit here over a month.
I want to offer you his place.
- Ok.
- Sit down, please.
Four weeks. Is that enough for you
to shoot new material?
We'll see.
I will pay for the printing and framing.
I think we can ask 500 dollars per photo.
I will take 50% from the profits
and 35% on royalties.
I'm thinking 60/40 on sales
and nothing on royalties.
Don't you think you are a little demanding
for someone who never exhibited?
You know my thinking.
You have Ivana's number. Thank you!
- Hello?
- It’s Ivana.
The gallery curator accepts your conditions.
She agrees with everything. That’s great, right?
- What? I’m not hearing you!
- She agrees to all your conditions!
She asked for a photo of you
to send it to the newspapers.
- Are you hearing me?
- I am.
I’ll call you later. Bye.
I don't want a single photo
of me in the press.
- This has got to be a joke.
- No, no joke.
- Give me an explanation, at least.
- It's no reason.
I decided the world
doesn't need to see my face.
The world?
Hold your horses!
Isn't it a little bit pretentious?
I don't care if people think I'm pretentious.
If they want my photos
they'll accept my conditions.
- Anyway, if they don't, it doesn't matter.
- Ok, I will see what I can do.
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry. I was in the mood for a beer.
Other people also like drinking beer.
Yes, they do,
But it was you I wanted to drink it with.
- Thank you. How are you?
- I’m fine.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I’m fine.
- The nice guy thinks I’m a loser...
- What is it? What do you want?
- What are you trying to find out?
- Nothing, Greg. Nothing.
I’m going.
How are you?
Ok.
You can take your time and look around.
Ok.
- So?
- It’s great.
Congratulations. It’s...
I don’t know... It’s strange...
Everything went so fast...
I feel...
Like I here and elsewhere at the same time.
This is Vilko, writer of the social page.
- Sorry?
- The COL News
You will not leave us
now that you've become someone.
I didn't become someone.
Hi.
I only wanted to say something...
And I am sober, you know...
I had to add this so you know
These are the thoughts of a lucid man.
Look around.
They believe the story you are telling.
That you are so talented you had to share it,
in order to live with it.
So, take advantage. Take advantage.
Take advantage! It doesn’t change anything!
Take advantage!
Are you ok?
I need some air...
Excuse me, do you speak English?
- Excuse me, do you speak English?
- Yes.
I am looking for a ship
to Brazil or Venezuela.
- Working?
- No, as a tourist. I pay for the trip.
- When do you want to live?
- Anytime. Tonight. Tomorrow.
Are you in trouble to be in such hurry?
"Le feu aux fesses" (your ass on fire)
as you French say?
- Everything is in order, I have a passport.
- Ok.
Follow me.
Euros.
500 now and 500 when you get on board, ok?
- Do you want to buy these?
- No, thank you!
No! Stay there!
Noooooooo!
You! You!... Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
Ok... I see! I see!
Stop!
Enough!
Leave him...
I won't say anything. Ok?
No problem! Look, look...
Look, everything is here. Ok?
Ok? No problem. I won't say anything.
Ok? You understand?
I can pay you, I have money.
No problem.
Throw him!
No! Wait!
- Fast!
- No!!!
He didn’t do anything!
- He’s not clandestine!
- Shut-up!
No! No! No!
Noooooooooooo!
No!
A ship! A ship!
Swim!
Come!
Come on!
Here... Ok!
- Oh my God... Is he the photographer?
- No, he’s one of the clandestine man.
- How much?
- 30 000.
Offer him 25, but I will give him 40 or 50
if he asks, ok?
Ok. I understand.
Mister! Please!
