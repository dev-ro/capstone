 - I'm gonna drop you off at school, alright?!
- OK.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm exhausted!
Where do you get
all your energy?
- Sleep.
- Sleep. Right.
Sleep's for wimps.
- Open this for me.
- What are these?
Am I as sexy as Elvis?
I want to ask you.
You could be.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Am I that bad
that you've gotta drink?
No man,
you're not that bad.
Look out!
No, dad, no!
Hello! This is Gorgeous.
Anybody out there read me?
10/4. I read.
My handle's Gorgeous.
Pretty vacant, hey?
My dad's handle's Flesh.
Subvert normality.
You know
what that makes us together?
Yeah, fucking nuts.
Fuck you! Together,
that makes us Flesh Gorgeous.
Flesh Gorgeous?
Punk is not sexual.
It's just aggression. 10/40, buddies!
Destroy! Kill all hippies!
I'm not talking at you,
I'm talking to you.
That's 10/4.
Anarchy!
Disco sucks!
I don't want to hear about you,

This is Gorgeous.
Does anybody out there read me?

How about disco? Over!
Disco sucks! Kill all hippies!
Pretty vacant, hey?
Subvert normality!
Sub- what normality? Gorgeous,

Tell me, what's this pretty vacant?

This is Gorgeous signing off.
See the moon?
Screw you!
- Hi Paul, hi mum!
- Hi, honey!
Hi, Cebe!
Cebe, why don't you
help your mum clean up?
You should be working.
Kids have to learn about that stuff.
You help her, she helps me
and everything gets better.
OK! One buck, 75!
OK, I'll compromise, a buck 60!
- You're on!
- Good!
Gorgeous!
Hi, Glenn!
Mum,
I don't wanna go to school today.
Forget it, you gotta go.
Why? You never finished school.
Hm! And look where I ended up.
It's great, huh?
Besides, where are you gonna
meet some nice guys?
Yeah they're all jerks like last year
and I'll not meet nobody.
You mean Crater Face?
What about Meat Boy?
He took 2 seats up.
(Laughs)
Well, he's kind of cute for a fat kid.
Hey, you two!
Here's your food.
Oh, yeah!
What's the joke?
Hey, waitress, I'm hungry!
It's just girl talk, you know.
Just silliness.
- Here you go, kiddo!
- Thank you!
You know, there are 2 kinds of guys.
The wild and sexy, dancing men...
and then there are your...
Cebe... your providers!
Know what I mean?
Honey, you know your daddy's gonna
be comin' home from prison real soon.
I know.
Boy, I really loved him.
We used to have the best times.
I got a problem.
- Elvis died on me.
- Oh, come on!
So I'm gonna kill myself
so I can go and visit him.
- Please!
- I'll be back, I promise!
- No way!
- Why?
You're not allowed.
Yeah.
You're staying right here
with your mummy
and your daddy
who's coming home soon.
- Don't do that, you know I hate that.
- I know, that's why I like to do it.
Well, too bad you're my mother.
You know what I mean?
I know.
Wait till you meet
your dad - again.
You haven't seen him for so long.
I forgot what he looks like.
I know, me too. I bet he looks
the same - sexy and tough.
I hope, anyway.
Yeah, he will...
You just wait...
Who do I look more like?
Mmm... Him! Sort of.
Except you're a girl.
Tough and sexy
in a real kind of nice way.
A girl-Don.
No, I'm not saying it right.
I'm not hungry!
It's his attitude! You've got
the same kind of... attitude.
You just wait. You're gonna be having
a real good time. Don't push things.
(Cebe singing Elvis song)
"When your baby leaves you.
And you've got no place to go...
just take a walk down
on the street of Heartbreak Hotel."
I could die...
What did you have
to leave me for?
Huh? Everybody left me.
My father left me,
Johnny Rotten left me,
Sid Vicious left me and now you,
the King, has to leave me.
I know you don't understand.
It's just not the same without you.
I'm trying...
See this thing? I got it from Paul.
This thing cost about $200.
I'm gonna make enough money
by being a rock star
I could afford 10 of them. I'm gonna
be like you, just wait! You'll see!
- What number?
- 14.
Visit number 14.
Lucky 14, there he is!
Get that phone!
What do you think
of this little sweetheart?
She's not
so little anymore, is she?
Oh, God!
- I miss you, Flesh.
- Yeah, Gorgeous.
You know I'm really sorry
that I haven't been in touch with you.
I don't really
have no excuse, 'cause...
I can see
I don't write, which is true.
I didn't really want you
to see me in here like this.
But you're old enough now, you see.
And... well... This is where
I've been for the last 5 years.
So, take a good look! I'll try and
make it up to you, don't worry.
Look, I've got a job.
What kind of job did you get?
I got a job
that's err... heavy equipment.
I will be running a big machine.
Wait till we get that rig back together.
Would you like that, Cebe?
Your hands shakin'
honey. Are you OK?
Time's up OK.
I'm gonna see you real soon.
Please forgive me Cebe.
I want you to come home now.
Kathy please get her out of here.
I'll see you real soon. Please Kathy.
- OK honey.
- Time's up.
See, it's better to burn out
than to fade away on me.
Pretty but not edible.
Oh fuck there's my mum and Paul.
Shit I don't want to see them.
Hey I want you to look over
your right shoulder, but very slowly.
- Why so slowly?
- So you don't lick your friggin' nose off.
You remember Sally?
We used to call her Basketball-Sally.
Could any of us forget Sally?
Now that little one with
the long hair is Sally's daughter.
Like mother like daughter.
Or like daughter like mother, right?
I'll be goddamned, you're Cebe.
Yeah she's growing up.
- Hey Cebe.
- Hiya Charles.
What do yer say? Hey where did
you get that scar. That's a nice scar.
Dad.
Oh yeah.
Desperate is not the word.
Ah, the accident.
If you see Donnie or write to him,
give him a big kiss for me will you.
Tell him I love him, and if you write
to him tell him I love him.
OK. Can I sleep over?
Oh yeah sure.
- Wait where are you going?
- My mum's over there.
Wait, I'll come with you...
- Hello!
- Hi Cebe!
- Can I sleep over Carol's?
- No honey, it's school night.
Oh why not?
Because I want you to get to
school on time tomorrow morning.
- I'll go.
- You'll be on time?
Thanks mummy.

You miss Donnie, don't you?
- You miss him a lot, don't you?

You miss him so much you

I chopped it off.

- Kathy...

Yeah well...

You know somethin' Paul?
You are an arsehole.
Well Charlie I've known

Go piss up a tree.
You're quick on your feet pal.
Don't shit

You can go fuck yourself!
Hey, that was heavy!
Heavy duty shit!

Hey, you want to come for a ride?

Nice car, nice pants, nice arse.
We'll think about it.
- Oh come on.
- Not you Donna, your hole's too big.
Fuck you motherfucker.

(Laughs)
Where's the limo?
What a smile!
I hate happy endings.
- Look, I'm crying.
- Yeah!
- Woh!
- Hey thanks.
Forget it. Otherwise the whole
bucket's goin' to end up on me.
Let's go.
I better not get caught with this,

- Look at her.
- Oh wow, man...
- Hope she'll get splinters.
- Queen Cebe. Look at her go down. Push her off.
Yeah, push her off.
Where do you want to go now?
Hey let's go over to Big Al's
and listen to cornball music.
We'll never get in.
- We're goin' in.
- Oh, ride on!
- The answer's no, Cebe.
- I'm havin' a rum n' coke.
Go ahead,
but I'm staying here.
- You comin' with me?
- I wouldn't last in there, you're crazy.
- You want to be a punk rocker?
- I don't want to get in shit.
Well, fuck you.
- Uh, well.
- You big chicken shit.
Subvert normality.
- Hello Cebe.
- I'll have a rum n' coke.
A rum and coke, right.
- A rum and coke Cebe?
- Yeah, I'm thirsty.
We can't serve you Cebe.
Come on out.
No, I'm thirsty.
I want my rum n' coke.
- You want it the hard or the easy way.
- Hard.
Alright, you got it.
Let go! Let go!
Put me down.
Take it easy Cebe.
Just take it easy.
I'm just a bit off balance.
I could have took you any day.
What are you laughin' at?
Hey Cebe,
come on, I love you.
- Yeah, you love me, my foot!
- Just take it easy.
Wait till my father
gets out of prison,

Yeah... go home Cebe.
Let's go!
Yeah!
Right move in. Keep your hands up.
Keep your hands up.
Come on. Go go.
Keep your hands up, come on.
Move, move.
That's it, very good.
Are you a punker?
I know of some punk
rock groups, you know.
- Do you like punk?
- Ah yeah. It's fun sometimes.
It's real good,
better than that disco shit.
- Disco sucks.
- Oh yeah.
Punk is here forever.
Want to come and get high.
Yeah, why not.
We could smoke
some grass and er...
maybe go and find Pointed Sticks
and go and punk out for the night.
Alright. You like punk?
It's OK.
Look what I did. Elvis.
Elvis is with me forever.
Punk is here to stay, man.
Disco sucks.
Elvis was one of the first punks.
Want to talk?
Here.
Go ahead light it up
I'll play you a tune.
Last night I heard you talkin'...
Bells replaced the rain...
Hey, this is Cebe.
She wants to meet you.
Dougie Dougie Dougie.
What does punk rock
mean to you?
What are you here for:
money, fame, what is it Richard?
What does your mother think?
What does punk rock mean to you?
Settle down my dear.
Say something legible.
- Legible?
- Yeah, tell us where your mind is.
Big smile.
Do it come on.
You're a chicken. Come on.
Do you mind giving me
your hat please?
Here.
If these are all your effects,
would you sign here.
Will someone get me a matron?
My case load is already too heavy.
Tell the court
to appoint another psychiatrist.
Right. No that won't work.
Well, that's the way
it's gotta be. Right.
- I'm sorry, Miss Barnes.
- It's alright.
Well, the judge's decision
seems to be pretty clear.
As a ward of the court,
you are free to go home Cindy.
But you gotta stay outta trouble.
No more running away from home.
No skipping school.
Oh listen Cindy, you're not
gonna get into trouble any more.
Are you Cindy?
Come on Cindy.
Tell Mr Brean how you're not gonna
get into any trouble. OK honey?
Come on honey. Tell Mr Brean.
Mr Brean uh... Cindy didn't realise
that those kids had stolen that car.
If she had,
she wouldn't have gotten in.
She wouldn't have
ever taken a ride with them.
- I thought Cindy took the car.
- I borrowed it.
Alright, whatever.
What you did was to endanger
your life and the lives of others.
Cindy knows that now.
I swear she does.
It's just that uh...
she forgets how young she is.
And she wants
to grow up so fast.
You know I tell you to enjoy
your youth while you've still got it.
- You know I do.
- Come off it mom.
Cindy's gotta come home.
It's just because we've been havin'
a rough time makin' ends meet
and we're all alone...
and everything.
Don't listen to her,
she's not alone.
Her daddy's comin' home.
We gotta be a family again.
I understand Miss Barnes.
Cindy...
If you have trouble trying to sort things
out at home, you could stay here.
We might be able to help.
I want to go home.
We'll be here if you need us.
- I'll be here. You understand.
- Mmm. Thank you.
Let's get outta here mom.
Yeah, let's go.
Bye.
- Hey Chucky, my dad's back.
- My name's Donnie.
Come on.
Hey motherfucker man.
Why don't you introduce me
to some of the broads.
Hey, alright.
I didn't know nobody till now.
I'll see you in a while.
Come on,

Hey, how are you doin'?
You remember Ron

What are you doin'?
Smack? Cocaine?
Oh you two.
You look adorable together.
I bet you're still a fuckin' criminal.
- Come on.
- Woh.
Let's go in the fuckin' kitchen.
For a second.
You understand what I mean joker.
Bamboo,

Eh! Watch you hands.
Slap him again for me.
Good evenin'.
- What's that?
- You try to get out?
Out of jail.
Out of jail. What,

What the fuck

- Do me a favour.
- Yeah?
Send her to bed.
- You want to go to bed darlin'?
- No.
She doesn't
want to go to bed.
Who are you?
What's goin' on?
- Do you want to talk to me?
- Do I want to talk to you?
Not necessarily,
not with your fuckin' attitude.
OK, what do you want?
We have somethin' to talk about.
Hey Cebe.
You know my daughter?
Yeah.
You go to school with my daughter?
Ride the bus?
Did you know my son?
Did you?
Remember my son?
OK man. Alright, alright.
See this?
I'm a motherfuckin' arsehole.
You know that?
I got five fuckin' years, you know.
In prison.
And there were a lot
of other kids besides your son.
Am I goin' to have to meet every
fuckin' arsehole like you man?
I'm an arsehole, you see this?
But I'm not a fuckin' dumb arsehole.
Cause there's enough here
for two drinks.
Now you sit down
and have a drink with me.
Come on.
Give him a dirty glass.
I'm sorry about your son.
I didn't have nothing to do with him.
- Hey motherfucker.
- Nobody's talkin' to you!
Fuckin' get out! Get out.
Get your fuckin' ass outta here.
I'll fuckin' put you
through the fuckin' window. Go!
Why did you let
him talk to you like that?
Dad!
What are you doin' here?
Thought I'd come and pick you up.
How come you're so late?
Seems like I been waitin' forever.
I got into a fight.
Did you win?
Pow. Bang. Boom!
I gotta beer.
- That's all that matters, isn't it.
- Uh uh. Let's get outta here.
Wait a second.
You're my buddy right?
Watch this. See that girl
over there reading. See over there.
- Attractive.
- Go get her, tiger!
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go and see mom.
Hey.
- What did you do in school today?
- Nothin'.
Nothin'? That's good.
That's what I learnt.
Don't tell mummy though.
You want to go for a picnic?
OK steer.
OK go.
Let me look at the girl.
Wowee. I tell you.
Don't tell your mum.
Don't worry.
Keep a secret?
Mm mm.
Remember that time
I talked to the principal?
And he let you outta school
and we drove down to Mexico?
We took 90 over to 125 and shot
straight down to Big 'A' town.
- You do remember?
- Yeah.
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- Maybe? I don't know.
How would you like to do
somethin' like that again?
Uh uh. Absolutively.
OK. 'Cause I'm gonna
get that rig back on the road.
I think
I can get it back in operation.
- What do you think about that?
- That'd be super.
Yeah, I could help you.
No kiddin'!
We could do it together
and we could have the perfect rig.
Alright.
'Cause I think with my job and
everythin' I could borrow some money.
I could get that thing back in operation
in maybe three months.
What do you think about that?
- Like that?
- Mm mm.
That would be... yeah... I wouldn't
have to go to school no more.
Oh dynamite. Do it!
Please do it.
OK.
Stop that and talk to me.
We should see each other again.
You're makin' it
really hard on me.
- I don't want to make it hard on you.
- Well you are.
I want to make it good.
Hi there.
See who's here?
Yeah. This is the time to do it.
To tell him. To stand up
and straighten that out.
- Be my friend.
- I am your friend.
You can change things right now.
- Look who's here.
- The bully gets all the marbles.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Got the kid in the car.
How'd you like to go on a picnic?
Huh? A little family picnic.
I'm workin'.
You're workin'? There's nobody here.
I know.
I'm still workin'.
Let me fix it with Paul.
- Hi Paul.
- Hi.
Thought you was fuckin' nuts
when you got this place.
Fuckin' garage, right.
Done a real good job with it.
- It's doin' OK.
- Yeah?
I'm gonna take my ladies out,
for a little picnic.
Kathy can't go.
She has to work.
There ain't nobody
in the fuckin' place.
- She's staying here.
- Give me a fuckin' break.
Thank you Paul. Thanks a lot.
See I told you.
Ain't that easy?
Get your stuff. See you later Paul.
Thank you.
Kathy, why didn't
you stand up to him.
Like you just did?
- What?
- Like you just did?
Well why don't you go.
- Give me my purse and stuff.
- Get it yourself.
They're right there.
That's right, it is a nice day.
I'll see you later, thanks.
- Ah!
- Alright.
You're a teddy bear.
Put a chain around my neck...
Donnie, you'll get us killed!
Watch the road!
I'm not gonna get nobody killed.
I just want to be your teddy bear.
Rub my fingers through my hair
and cuddle me real tight.
Alright, alright.
Go go go. Go Gorgeous. Alright.
Donnie.
Donnie, it's freezing out here.
Dad!
The sand is cold and it's damp
and this is no place to have a picnic.
Come on, wait a second.
We're havin' a good time, Kathy.
I'm not gonna have my daughter
get pneumonia because of you.
She's my daughter too.
What's the matter with you Kathy?
We're havin' a good time,
we're havin' a picnic.
I'm cold.
- It's because of my driving?
- I don't want to end up dead.
How do you think you made me
feel when you said that?
I ain't gonna kill nobody, Kathy.
That bothered me.
You know. Do you?
Sorry.
Sorry ain't gonna cut it Kathy.
Goddam family picnic.
This is great Kathy.
I'm not gonna forget this.
Oh boy. Alright.
Can we come back tomorrow?
We'll have other times.
Tomorrow? You promise?
'Cause you don't keep
your promises.
Great day. Great day!
What the hell are you doin' here?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I chewed a penny in half.
Chewed it in half uh?
Metal teeth.
I came down to see you.
Get in. Get in the car.
What's that dynamite for?
Oh this?
Don't get cute with me man.
I know what it is.
I'm not dumb.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah. Get in the car.
What are you using it for?
It's worth money man.
If I figure some way to use it...
Yeah, and if we blow up.
Good joke.
You find things at the garbage dump.
Worth some money, you know.
Jesus Christ.
Can't figure it out.
Can I drive?
Drinking on the job.
Do you know what I mean.
Did you hear
Cebe's dad out of jail?
And my dad's gonna get him
for killin' my little brother.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Come here.

My, my! Look who's here!
Come over here

I never liked your face.
I'd rearrange it for you.
I hear your dad's working
in the garbage dump Cebe.
What's it to you?
You don't scare me.
A punk rocker
would never scare you.
Here you go.
Disgusting.
What do you think you're doing?
I painted your face blue.
Looks better that way.
An' if you don't shut up
and get outta here,
I'm gonna take you outta the blue
and put you into the black.
That's so good.
Great.

Dammit Cindy, why do you make
things so difficult for yourself?
Principal wants you
out of the school.
Judge is probably going
to take you out of your home.
- I don't care.
- You don't care?
I thought you did care.
I thought
you wanted to stay at home.
Don't you realise
that you're on a one-way road
straight to a detention centre?
- I'll just run away.
- They'll send you to another.
I'll run away again.
Then they'll lock you up in a place
from which you can't run away.
It's my life,
I can do what I want with it!
Alright.
You tell me...
What do you want to do
with your life?
Mom and me
will move to the city,
I'll go to school there.
I don't like this hick school anyway.
Your mom and you will move?
I thought things were gonna be better
when your dad got home.
There's something you're not
telling me. What is it Cindy?
Cindy?
Hey man!
Come on, lighten up!
We got Anderson's dough!
Great Champagne.

- You're gonna be...
- I don't want her to be a dyke.
What?
I don't want her to be a dyke.
A dyke?

If she's a dyke,

She's right. She's right.
Get outta my clothes.
I'm fucked up.
But you get outta my clothes.
And you.
Dress her like a lady.
- Don't want to.
- Yeah? What do you mean?
Aah, man.
Fucking trucks got to go.
They got to go.
They got to go.
They got to go.
The drums can stay.
The drums can stay.
The guitar stay.
Public Enemy, Subhumans,
Teenage Head.
I'd rip those down,
like in one fuckin' second man.
Punk. Punk.
Elvis, Elvis, Elvis.
Oh man, I know, man about Elvis.
- You know somethin'?

Hey! I'm a punk.
Now I want you

and have a good time

and I'll see you in my dreams.
'Cause I'm gettin' outta here.
I hate fuckin' men.
Fucking hate them.

See you in the morning.
Get her dressed, and out of my
clothes and into somethin' pretty.
Get the fuck out of my room.
- Go! Go! Go!
- Alright.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
What are you trying to do!
Oh God.
Do you remember
layin' down there
holdin' your teddy bear
when the lights used to go by
and I used to sit over there.
Do you remember?
Like that with that teddy bear?
Do you remember that?
Do you remember
when you sucked your thumb?
- Still do.
- Oh look.
Want a hit?
Oh shit.
What are you lookin' at?
Come here.
Take a good look.
- Remember?
- You fuckin' right I remember.
Do you remember Daddy?
Come here.
Come here, take a good smell.
Whatever happened
to the cotton panties?
Oh God.
- Hey.
- Turn off the light.
Mom I gotta talk to you now.
- Honey. Can't it wait till tomorrow?
- No. Now. Let's go.
It's about Dad and I want to talk.
- Alright, alright.
- Come on.
- It's personal.
- Right. I'm coming.
Cindy, if this is some kind of game,
this isn't any fun.
Come on Mom.
Hang on to my hand.
Careful I can't see a thing.
Where the hell you takin' me?
- We're going to where it all started.
- What d' ya mean, where it all started?
- Ow! God damn!
- I want to talk to you about Dad.
- What is this old wreck? Cindy!
- This is the place. Get in!
Alright we'll talk about your Dad.
Tell me, what do you know about him,
I don't know, anyway, huh?
What do you know?
It's freezin' in here.
You're just going to cool it.
- You shouldn't be smokin' Cebe.
- Shut up.
Oh God.
Oh, what are ya doin'?
What is it? What is that?
- Whatever the fuck you want it to be.
- Well get it out.
It's a fuse.
- Uh. Get it outta here!
- It's a fuse.
There's nothin' behind it,
it's a punk gesture.
I thought you wanted
to talk about your Dad
if you want to talk punk,
let's go in the kitchen.
I know one thing you weren't,
you weren't a punk.
An' you know what...
Dad knows
more about punk than you do.
'Cause Sid Vicious when he left,
he took his loved ones with him.
Uh! That's totally meaningless.
I don't get the point. I'm leaving.
That's right.
Oh. Baby no.
That's right.
