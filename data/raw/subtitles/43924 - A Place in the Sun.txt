[Horn Honks]
Want a ride?
Is this the place?
Yeah.
Yes?
I'd like to see
Mr. Charles Eastman.
So would I.
I expect to, if I work here
another five years.
How do I get
to his office?
Better go to the
administration building.
Uh, just a moment.
I'll be along
as soon as I get more.
We'll get going.
Uh, Mr. Eastman?
Yes.
I'm awfully sorry.
Our Mr. Eastman
is at home today.
He won't
be coming in.
Oh.
Uh, tell me,
are you a relative?
He's my uncle.
I'm sure
he'll want to see you.
Let me give him a ring.
Oh, yes.
One moment, please.
Paris can dictate
all they want to women
what to wear
to cocktail parties
or to bed
or the bridge game,
but Paris won't
tell American women
what bathing suits
to wear.
Miss Ottinger.
Hello.
Who?
Oh, yes. Of course.
All right, Margaret,
let me have a word
with the young man.
Thank you.
It's on number two.
Hello?
Hello, my boy.
I hope
you remember, sir.
Of course.
How are you?
You certainly
got here fast.
Well, I wanted to.
But I certainly
didn't want
to bother you
at home, sir.
Tell you what you do.
Drop out to the house
about 7:00.
Yes, sir.
See you then.
Thank you
very much, sir.
[Click]
What's the matter, Dad?
My tie on crooked?
No, it's just
that I was thinking...
George Eastman's
dropping in tonight.
George Eastman?
You mean Asa's son?
That's right.
I ran into him
in Chicago.
Will he lead us
in prayer?
He's not at all
like Asa or his wife.
He's very quiet
and pleasant.
Not much education,
but ambitious,
and he looks
amazingly like Earl.
What's he do?
He was a bellhop
in my hotel.
Fine. I always wanted
to look like a bellhop.
Why are you
bringing him here?
There's always
a place at the plant.
What will we do
about him socially?
We can all leave town.
You don't have to
take him up socially.
He just wants to
work and get ahead.
Ayoung man
by the name of Eastman.
Show him in,
William.
Charles,
sometimes I think
you're in
your second childhood.
Good evening, sir.
Oh, hi, George.
This is my wife.
How do you do?
My daughter Marcia.
My son Earl.
George Eastman.
Sit down, George.
Thank you.
Like a cocktail,
a drink?
Uh, no, thank you.
My husband says
he met you in Chicago.
You were working
at a hotel there.
Yes. That's right.
You must have
left there suddenly.
Well, uh...
see, I quit my job.
Mr. Eastman was good
enough to say
that if I came
through here,
perhaps he'd be able
to find some place
for me at the mills.
I think we can work
something out.
What do
you think, Earl?
Have you ever done
any bookkeeping,
typewriting,
stenography?
No, l...
You see Earl at the plant
in the morning.
Thank you, sir.
That's very kind
of you.
And your mother,
I trust she's well.
[Horn Honks]
We've never met,
but I've heard her
mentioned occasionally.
She wrote Charles
such a moving letter
when your father died.
Is she still active
in her religious work?
Yes, ma'am, she is.
Church work?
Not exactly.
It's more like, uh...
like social work.
It's a mission.
Oh. Like
the Salvation Army?
No. It's not like
the Salvation Army.
It's...
Well, it's more...
More intimate, maybe.
Did you say you were
getting intimate, Earl?
You're late,
Vickers.
I'm always late.
It's part of my charm.
Good evening,
Mr. Eastman, Mrs. Eastman,
you know
Tom Tipton, don't you?
Don't let him
have a drink.
We haven't got time.
Thanks.
Well, I'm ready.
I'm ready, too.
Men are so
disgustingly prompt.
They do it to put
women in a bad light.
I hear your lake place
is coming along fine.
Did Marcia tell you?
It's a dream palace.
I'm ending
my days there.
Will it be ready
for summer?
Even if I have
to use a whip.
Simone Legree, let's go.
Uh, good night, Eastman.
Oh, good night.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Have you made
any arrangements
to stay in town?
I can recommend
a quiet rooming house.
My former secretary
stayed there.
I found a place
this afternoon.
Well, that was
fortunate, wasn't it?
Thank you.
I'm sorry we won't
be home for dinner,
but some
other time, perhaps.
Yes, my boy.
See Earl
in the morning.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Charles Eastman.
You've got to be
aware every minute...
whatever your job is...
that you're an Eastman,
and you're expected
to act accordingly.
I understand that.
I hope so.
We'll go through here.
Oh, another thing.
As you probably noticed,
9 out of 10 Eastman
employees are women.
There's a company rule
against any of us
mixing socially
with the girls
who work here.
My father asked me to particularly
call this to your attention.
That is a must.
Mrs. Harper,
this is George Eastman.
Take George
to Mr. Whiting.
Yes, sir.
[Wolf Whistle]
Mrs. Kovak.
Yes?
This is George Eastman.
He's going to work
here for a while.
O.K. This is it.
Now you're
in business.
[Laughing]
[Whistle Blows]
[Horn Honks]
Hello, Angela.
- Hello.
- Hi, Angela.
[Laughing And Talking]
... And look, this room
could be your study.
There's even a cupboard
for your books.
Ha! Whatever else
is in it, it isn't...
[Loud Crash]
I wonder who
could have lived here.
A pirate in search
of his soul.
Do you think
he found it?
Do you think
we could find ours?
Vickey...
What?
Do you think
we could be happy here?
Small world.
That's what you think.
Imagine the sea at night.
Who's your friend?
Our faces close together.
Hold me, Ray.
[Kissing Sounds]
When I feel you
close to me like this,
it seems all
our dreams come true,
that nothing can
ever spoil them again...
[End Music Plays]
[Exit Music Plays]
Know what
the girls would say
if they saw me
walking with you?
They'd say
I was making up
to the boss' nephew.
I'm in the same boat
as the rest of you.
If you're
an Eastman,
you're not in
the same boat with anyone.
I work with you,
don't I?
Sure, but pretty soon
they'll move you up
to a better job.
You'll find yourself
in the front office.
That's the last we'll
see of George Eastman.
Who says that?
Everybody knows
they put you in with us
to learn the business.
I wouldn't be
too sure of that.
'Tis the Lord's
divine command
When you find
a brother struggling
Lend a willing,
helping hand
Bear ye one
another's burdens...
Are you lonely
all of the time?
Not on weekdays.
How come?
Well, remember
I put swim suits in boxes
six days a week?
Yeah.
What about Sundays?
Maybe then you put
yourself in a swim suit?
Not me.
Why?
You don't look good
in a swim suit?
Sure, I do.
I can't swim.
You're kidding.
I never learned.
L... I was even scared
of the duck pond
when I was a kid.
We live on a farm.
A small one.
How come you came here?
Oh...
we were poor.
We needed the money.
I came down here
and got a job.
I'm glad.
Me, too.
This is it.
Where I live.
It's 4433 1/2
Elm Avenue.
I'll walk you
to the door.
Oh, I can manage
from here.
I have my own
private entrance.
Good night.
Oh, my landlady
is fierce.
I've been wanting
to do that for so long.
I did, too.
Will we see each other
again like this?
If you want.
When?
It's up to you.
You got to
be careful.
We can meet
like tonight.
Oh! Tonight
has been wonderful.
I better go in now.
Don't go.
Please don't go.
Good night.
I was looking
over at you today.
I was looking at you.
Not as much
as you usually do.
I was thinking about
my speed-up plan.
Don't we work
fast enough as it is?
Hello, Angela.
Hello.
George, I'm glad you're still
in the packaging room.
And not just
for my sake... honest.
It's better for you
than running around
with those Eastmans
and their bunch
and all those rich girls
with nothing to do.
I've only been to their house
once since I got here.
It's funny.
I used to think
you went there every night.
Don't be silly, honey.
George,
remember when I said,
if you're an Eastman,
you're not in the same
boat with anybody?
Yeah?
I take it back.
Come on.
Let's find a party.
You don't know any other
place we can go, do you?
There's this
soda fountain
on the edge of town
where all
the high school kids go.
They're noisy.
I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.
What are you doing here?
Talking.
Look, boy, they've
invented the house.
It's a good place
to talk in.
You'd better
get back to yours.
Go on.
Come on.
Good night.
Come on.
Ohh...
Gee, I wish
I could ask you in,
but Mrs. Roberts
is so strict.
[Radio Plays]
I don't want to make
things difficult.
[Radio Plays Louder]
Ooh!
[Radio Plays Softly]
I wish I could
ask you in,
but we'd have to keep
the music awful low.
This is nice.
Mrs. Roberts
is right next door.
This is the way
it should have been.
This is the way...
Oh, George.
George...
[Static]
[Rooster Crows]
[Door Opens And Closes]
[Bell Rings]
Good morning.
Good morning.
Who is that?
Is that George?
That's George.
What have you
got him doing?
This was the only
position open.
You said no favoritism.
This is
no place for him.
How's he doing,
Whiting?
Fine.
It wouldn't hurt
to give him a position.
Hello, George.
I suppose you thought
I'd forgotten
all about you.
No, sir.
I've been keeping
an eye on you.
That's very
good of you, sir.
Getting along all right?
I know the work
pretty well now, sir.
Yes,
I suppose you do.
Do you know it
well enough
to take on
some responsibility?
Yes, sir.
Good. I'm going
to move you up.
Thank you
very much, sir.
You've earned it.
Oh, uh, sir...
I was wondering if...
have you
by any chance
seen the production
report I submitted?
Tell you what,
George.
Mrs. Eastman is having
a party at the house
on the 15th
of next month.
We'd like you
to drop in.
Thank you, sir.
I'd love to come.
Then you and I can have
a nice little talk.
Next month,
on the 15th,
that's your birthday.
I was planning
on our little party.
Sure, honey.
I'll be over at the old man's
a little while,
to pay my respects.
Then I'll be over.
You'd better be.
Hello, darling.
It's nice
to see you again.
Hello there.
[Dance Music Plays]
Later.
Wow.
Hello.
Hello.
I see you had
a misspent youth.
I guess it was.
Why all alone?
Being exclusive?
Being dramatic?
Being blue?
I'm just fooling around.
Maybe you'd
like to play.
Oh, no, I'll just
watch you. Go ahead.
Do I make you
nervous?
Yes.
You look like
an Eastman.
Are you one
of them?
Mm-hmm. I'm a nephew.
My name's George.
I'm Angela.
Vickers.
I saw you here
last spring.
I don't remember
seeing you before.
No.
You've been away,
haven't you?
You took a trip
with your parents.
How did you know?
I read about you
in the papers.
And what else
do you do?
The usual things.
You look unusual.
That's the first time
anybody ever said that.
You keep pretty much
to yourself, don't you?
Yes, sometimes.
Blue...
or exclusive?
Well, neither right now.
Oh, here you are, George.
Well... Angela.
Look, George, I was thinking
about your mother.
How is she?
Fine, last time
I heard.
Have you written to her
about your promotion?
I kicked him up
a notch the other day.
Smart boy.
Not yet. I was going
to write her soon.
Never neglect
your mother.
You're going to telephone
to her right away,
tell her
the good news.
You can use this
phone on the bar.
Long distance?
What's the number,
George?
Just a minute.
I don't know.
Hello?
I want to place
a call
to the Bethel Independent
Mission in Kansas City.
Kansas City,
Missouri.
[Ring]
The Bethel Mission.
Hello, Mama?
George.
God bless you, my son.
Are you sick?
No, Mama,
I'm not sick.
Have you called to tell me
you're coming home?
Listen, Mama,
I got a promotion.
Yeah.
I can send you money
every month now.
Happy birthday, George.
Today's your birthday,
and I've prayed for you.
I've been praying
that you'll come home soon
and that you'll carry on
your father's work
where he left off.
I'm keeping your room
for you, George,
just as you left it...
like I always do.
Uh... I'm getting on...
I'm getting on
pretty well here, Mama.
I'm happy here, too.
[Pop]
Who's there
with you, George?
It's me, Mama.
Who was that?
Just...
Just a girl, Mama.
No, Mama.
I don't...
Mama,
I just met her.
Yes, Mama.
I will, Mama.
You'll be a good son.
I promise.
Goodbye, my son.
Goodbye, Mama.
Did you promise
to be a good boy?
And not to waste
your time on girls?
I don't waste
my time.
Will she let you
go out tonight?
Will she let you
go dancing?
Come on.
I'll take you dancing...
on your birthday...
blue boy.
[Music Playing]
Good night.
[Music Playing]
Gee, Al...
isn't it the limit?
The party just broke up
a few minutes ago.
I'm sorry, honey.
I couldn't get away
for three hours.
Four hours.
You must have paid him
an awful lot of respects.
I think he's really going to do
things for me, honey.
He said, "I got
my eye on you."
I think he really
means it, too.
That's fine...
but you could
have phoned me.
[Turns Off Radio]
Yeah, I know, I know.
I could have phoned.
Never mind.
Your... present's waiting
for you on your plate.
Oh.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Hey, that's wonderful.
Boy, I can sure use that
on my new job, huh?
Were there many young people
there tonight?
A few. Why?
Oh, it's melted.
Was your cousin
Marcia there?
All those
other pretty girls
you read about
in the papers?
Some of them
were, yes.
They're not all pretty.
Was... Angela Vickers?
What?
Pretty.
Did you like her
very much?
I liked her some.
Sure,
she's a pretty girl.
She wears nice clothes.
Well, why shouldn't she
with all that money?
Honey, why do
you have to keep
needling me
all the time?
I can't help it.
I still don't see why
you couldn't tell them
you had another
appointment.
You know I can't
tell them about you.
You understand
the fix we're in.
Yeah... I know.
If my family ever
found out about us,
we'd both be
out of a job.
George...
maybe you don't want to
see me so much anymore.
Is that it?
Or maybe you don't
want to see me at all,
now that you're head
of the department.
You know
I didn't say that.
Oh, honey, don't cry.
[Sobbing]
Look, you dance as...
pretty as anybody.
You look just as pretty.
So... stop crying,
will you?
Oh, George...
it's awful.
L... I can't tell you.
What is it?
Well, I'm so afraid.
Honey,
what's the matter?
George...
we're in trouble...
real trouble...
I think.
How do you mean?
Oh...
remember
the first night...
you came here?
Oh, I'm so worried.
[Whistle Blows]
[Clock Chimes]
Hello, Al? It's me.
How do you feel?
Oh.
Just the same, huh?
No.
I haven't found the name
of any doctor yet.
Hmm?
Yes, I will.
Don't you worry.
Everything's going
to turn out all right.
Yeah?
Yeah, first thing.
Good night.
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
Hello?
Speaking.
Who?
Oh, hello.
Yes. Of course
I remember you.
I just didn't recognize
your voice at first.
Oh...
Friday night?
Yeah?
I think I can.
No, I'd like to. Yes.
Where?
All right.
I'll meet you there.
Yeah.
Goodbye, Miss Vickers.
Huh?
Ha ha ha.
Goodbye, Angela.
Goodbye.
Penny.
For what?
For your thoughts.
Highest prices paid.
I was just wondering
why you invited me tonight.
Oh... 'cause
of my reasons.
Good evening,
Miss Vickers.
Good evening, William.
Good evening,
Mr. Eastman.
Good evening.
Angela,
darling, hello.
Hello, Marcia.
Hello, George.
Having fun?
I just got here.
Come in and
join the party.
Oh, it's going to be
such a wonderful summer.
Do you ride?
I'm just
taking it up.
Hello, Mother... Dad.
We keep several horses
on the place.
There will be lots of parties
and dances.
Who, may I ask,
is he?
If she weren't
my daughter,
I should feel inclined
to ask her the same question.
Aren't you
happy with me?
Happy?
The trouble is
I'm too happy tonight.
You seem so strange...
so deep and far away,
as though you were
holding something back.
I am.
Don't.
I'd better.
This is nice.
I don't want to spoil it.
You'd better tell me.
I love you.
I've loved you since
the first moment I saw you.
I guess maybe I even loved you
before I saw you.
And you're the fellow
that wondered
why I invited
you here tonight.
I'll tell you why.
I love...
Are they
watching us?
I love you, too.
It scares me.
But it is
a wonderful feeling.
It's wonderful
when you're here,
and I can hold you,
I can see you.
But what's it going to
be like next week?
All summer long.
I'll be just as much
in love with you,
and you'll be gone.
I'll be at the lake.
You'll come up
and see me.
Oh, it's so
beautiful there.
You must come.
I know my parents
will be a problem,
but you can come
on the weekends
when the kids
from school are up there.
You don't have
to work weekends.
If you don't come,
I'll drive here
to see you.
I'll pick you up
outside the factory.
You'll be my pickup.
Oh, we'll arrange
it somehow...
whatever way we can,
and we'll have such
wonderful times together...
just the two of us.
I'd be the happiest
person in the world.
The second happiest.
Oh, Angela, if I
could only tell you
how much I love you.
If I could only
tell you all.
Tell Mama.
Tell Mama all.
Your age,
Mrs. Hamilton?
22.
How long married?
Three months.
Well, now...
Oh, sit down.
What seems to be the trouble,
Mrs. Hamilton?
You needn't be
afraid to tell me.
That's my business...
listening to other
people's troubles.
Well...
it's like this.
My husband
h-hasn't much money.
And...
I have to work
to help pay the expenses.
Yes.
[Clock Chimes]
When I found out I was
going to have a baby...
we didn't see, uh...
we didn't know
any doctors who...
What business is
your husband in, Mrs. Hamilton?
Electrician.
Well, now, that's not
such a bad business...
At least
they charge enough.
We can't afford to...
Of course, there are
free hospitals, you know.
I know.
Free hospitals
don't solve everything.
Tell me...
how did you happen
to come to me, anyhow?
I heard people say
you were a good doctor.
I see.
Mrs. Hamilton,
when you went to the altar
three months ago,
you
must have realized
you might have to face
a situation like this.
Well now, once you
make up your mind
to face
this bravely,
you'll find all
these problems
have a way of sorting
themselves out.
Medical bills...
clothes...
I know.
I know my wife and I
worried at first.
But now we can look
back and realize...
It's not like that.
I'm not married.
I haven't got
a husband.
All right.
That won't do
any good.
Where's the young man?
He deserted me.
Oh, what will I do?
Somebody's
got to help me.
Miss Hamilton...
my advice is
go home and see your parents
and tell them.
It will be much
better that way,
I assure you.
If you've come to place yourself
under my professional care
during
your pregnancy,
I'll do everything
to ensure your health
and your child's.
On the other hand,
if you've come for...
free advice on
material and financial problems...
which I can't help...
No, I cannot
help you.
What did he say?
He said he thought I ought
to make a very healthy mother.
Gee, Al...
George, that's all you've been
saying to me for weeks.
I'm trying to think.
You just
got to marry me.
Family or no family.
This future of yours
or no future.
Just looking at it that
way settles everything,
but we haven't
got any money.
This comes out,
I'm through.
I won't even have
the little job I got now.
You're stalling.
I'm not!
I'm trying
to think of...
I want to figure out
some way, maybe.
I was thinking maybe...
when I get my vacation,
first week in September...
All right,
that's when we'll do it.
When you get
your vacation,
we'll go someplace way out
of town and get married.
You understand?
Yeah, I understand.
Now back again
to the news.
The fine weather
we've been having
has been
a little too fine
in other parts
of the country.
In New York City,
seven persons succumbed
over the weekend
from the high temperatures
still prevailing.
Meanwhile, near home,
fine weather
had its darker aspects.
The highway patrol
reports that fatalities
from traffic and
other weekend accidents
exceeded by four
the high figure
for the corresponding
weekend last summer.
Some 14 persons
lost their lives.
Among these, at least
five were drowned,
and several others received
emergency first aid treatment
at crowded lake resorts.
So be careful.
Remember,
it may be your turn next
or the turn of those
nearest and dearest to you.
Drive carefully.
If you aren't
a good swimmer,
don't swim
from unpatrolled beaches.
Make your holiday
death's holiday, too.
[Horn Honks]
[Tap]
George!
Hello, you!
I've missed you so.
Me, too.
Oh, I'm...
I can't tell you how much.
I have
wonderful news,
so wonderful I had to
drive down to tell you.
Mother and Dad want you
to spend your vacation
with us up
at the lake.
Well, you'll come,
won't you?
I don't think I can.
Oh, George, no.
Look, this is
my one chance
to show you off
to Mother and Dad.
Take my word for it,
I've got to if...
I promised my uncle some time
with him during my vacation.
That's perfect.
Your aunt and uncle
are coming up
on September 3rd.
That's when
you're coming.
Oh, darling,
I love you so much.
So very much.
Just think of it.
We'll go
swimming together,
lie in the sun
together,
go horseback riding
through the pine woods.
And I'll make your breakfast
for you every morning.
You can sleep late.
I'll bring it in to you
in your room.
And you love me.
Yes.
Hello?
Listen, Al...
uh...
l... I've got to
ask you a favor.
Don't get angry at me.
I've got to ask
for an extra week.
I don't have to
give you anything.
Y-You just got to.
Uh, the thing is...
I just talked
to my uncle.
He wants me to come up
to Bride's Lake
and spend the first week
of my vacation with them.
It's important to us.
Why is it important?
I figure, from the way
he's been talking,
if I go up there, uh...
he's going
to give me a bonus.
It might be
a lot of money.
I don't know,
$200, $300.
We could sure use that.
All right, you go
up there for a week.
I'll wait here.
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.
I'm not sure I approve
of young Mr. Eastman.
I certainly don't know
what he's doing here.
Oh, I do, Tony.
He's here because
I invited him.
Would you mind telling me
why you encourage this?
You can be very
unperceptive at times.
Opposition only makes
a boy of that type
appear more attractive.
I wanted to see him
set down 24 hours a day
among people
Angela really knows.
She'll see whether
he belongs or not.
Aah!
Oh, come on!
Oh, I'm freezing to death!
It's like ice!
Hurry up!
I've never been
so cold in all my life.
Oh!
Aren't you going in?
Sure!
Oh, no!
George, put me down!
No!
Oh!
Oh, it happens
every time.
Every single time.
What does?
I freeze to death.
It's the coldest lake
I've ever known.
What do you
go in for then?
'Cause it's my lake.
Yours?
Uh-huh.
I found this trail
when I was 14.
Nobody lives here,
you know.
At least
not on this part.
It's in two parts,
with a little channel
in between.
There's a crumbly old lodge
at the end of the other part.
And some crumbly
old boats.
Ahh!
Come closer.
What do they call
this lake?
Loon Lake.
It's nice now.
Sometimes
it's weird.
Especially
at sundown.
I've never felt the same about it
since the drowning.
What drowning?
A man and a girl,
last summer.
Nobody knows exactly
what happened.
I guess
their boat capsized.
It was five days before
they found the girl's body.
And the man?
They never found him.
[Loon Calls]
[Loon Calls]
What was that?
A loon.
[Loon Calls]
George, what are you
thinking about?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Hi.
Hi.
And I used to think I
was complicated.
Are you worried
about my family?
Yes. I suppose I am.
Don't.
I've known them intimately
for several years,
and they're
quite nice.
Perhaps they are
a little unused to you,
but... but that
will come in time.
Suppose it doesn't?
I'd go anywhere
with you.
You really mean that?
You'd marry me?
Haven't I told you?
I intend to.
[Loon Calls]
Every time, I've had
a millstone named Eastman
around my neck.
I know how
you feel, Tony.
What's golf got
that a 20-mile hike hasn't?
Dad says it's the spirit
of competition.
I've hardly spoken
with your elusive nephew. Pity.
I'm told
he's charming.
I've put him
on my right tonight
to make sure
he won't run away.
My boy, I'm proud of the way
you've been getting on.
I've wanted to justify
the confidence you've shown in me.
Ayoung man who
can meet people...
That's an asset
we can use up front.
I've been thinking about
a place for you with us,
in administration
perhaps,
where I can keep
an eye on you myself.
Tony.
Yes?
Let's take George
with us tomorrow.
People at the club...
Oh, no, you don't.
There's the Labor Day
ski race tomorrow.
George is my pilot.
Which Mr. Eastman?
Mr. George Eastman.
Call for you,
George.
For me?
You better bend an ear, Angela.
It's a woman.
Hello?
Yes?
I'm here
at the bus station.
Well, uh...
You lied to me, George,
for the last time.
Now I want you
to come and get me.
That's not going to
be easy right now.
Now.
I'll do it
tomorrow morning.
I said now!
If you're not here
in half an hour,
I'll come
where you are.
I'll tell them everything, George.
I mean it.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
I'll leave right away.
Let's not go to Florida
this winter.
Let's stay right here.
Fine.
That was, uh,
that was a friend
of my mother's.
She's not well.
Oh, I hope it's
not serious.
I don't know.
I, uh,
I ought to get home.
I ought to try
and get a plane tonight.
If it's not serious,
do come back.
We'll
be expecting you.
I will. Thank you.
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go pack.
Certainly.
Goodbye, George.
Bye, George.
Male mako aloha.
George, how long
will you be gone?
I don't know,
darling.
I just don't know.
You will come back
to me, won't you?
As soon as you can.
As soon as I can.
You promise?
I promise.
Are you crazy,
coming up here?
Phoning me like that
with my whole family listening in.
You weren't even staying
with your family.
You were staying
with Angela Vickers.
George, I'm through
waiting for you.
Now, you're going
to marry me tomorrow,
or l-l-I'll telephone
the newspapers
and tell them
everything,
and then
I'll kill myself.
Don't talk
like that.
You make me
talk like that.
Now, we'll go to Warsaw
in the morning
and get married.
Let's get out of here.
I won't get out of here
until you say you will,
that you're
going to do it!
All right. Come on.
[Bells Ring]
Labor Day.
It's a holiday.
Al, look. Al.
Look, Al,
it's not my fault.
Besides, one day more is not
going to make any difference.
Say, there's a wonderful
lake near here.
Loon Lake.
Just the kind of place
you've always wanted
to go for a honeymoon.
We could go up there.
Hey, there's a lodge
on it, too.
If you like,
we could, uh,
spend a day there,
and then tomorrow
we can come back here.
Al, are you listening?
Yeah.
I'm listening.
Tell you what.
Why don't we...
Let's make a holiday
out of it.
Everybody else is.
Why don't we
go get sandwiches?
Then let's have a picnic
on the lake.
How's that?
That sounds pretty good.
Look, Al, let's...
Let's not quarrel anymore.
Let's... try and make
the best of it, huh?
All right. Let's
make the best of it.
[Car Stalls]
I should have stopped
at that last station.
Yeah. Bone-dry.
Stupid.
Is the lodge
very far from here?
No, it's, uh, it's only
just around the bend.
I tell you what.
Why don't we, uh...
Let's take our lunch
and go down
to the landing.
We can rent a boat
and have our picnic now.
Now?
Yeah. I can pick up
a can of gas later
and come back
and get the car.
How does it sound?
It sounds wonderful.
Oh, it is beautiful.
Yeah.
How much
to rent a boat?
25 cents an hour.
$2.00 all day.
Uh, are there
many people
out on the lake today?
Got it all to yourself.
All right?
Are you people
at the lodge?
Yeah. That is,
we will be tonight.
Probably spend
a couple of days there.
You'll have to sign
for it.
Sure.
Thanks a lot.
That's funny.
What?
I know another guy
named Gilbert Edwards.
Lives over at, uh, Westbrook.
It's a pretty
common name.
Only two times
I ever heard.
Aah! Aah!
This boat
doesn't leak, does it?
I don't rent
leaky boats.
Don't worry.
My husband's a very good swimmer.
[Loon Calls]
It's so lonely here.
It's like we were
the only two people left
in the whole world.
Maybe we are.
Maybe when we get
back to shore,
everybody else
will have disappeared.
I'd like that,
wouldn't you?
Then we could go
anywhere we wanted.
We could live in the biggest house
in the world if we wanted,
only I'd like to live
in a little house.
Just big enough
for the two of us.
Only there's going to be more
than two of us, isn't there?
What's the matter,
George?
You look sick.
Nothing.
All out of breath.
I'm not used
to rowing.
W-W-Well,
rest for a while, dear.
We can just drift.
After all, we're not
going anywhere.
Oh, look behind you.
Star light, star bright,
first star I see tonight,
wish me luck,
wish me light.
Make my wish
come true tonight.
Did you make a wish?
What did you wish?
Nothing.
You're afraid it won't
come true if you tell.
Al, I'm sorry
that I've been so...
so nasty to you.
I didn't mean it.
Just things happen,
and you just don't stay the same.
I will make it up
to you.
I'll stick by you.
I do love you, George.
We ought to get back.
It's getting dark.
That old man
will think we drowned.
But let's drift
like this for a while.
I'm not afraid
of the dark.
It's so nice.
I'll tell you
what I wished.
I wished that you
loved me again.
Oh, you'll see. We'll...
we'll make a go of it
if we give
ourselves a chance.
We'll go to another town
where nobody knows us,
and we'll get jobs,
may... maybe together.
W-We'll do things
together
and go out together, just like
any other old married couple.
George, you'll see.
After a while,
you'll settle down,
and you'll be happy
with what you got
instead of working
yourself up
over things
you can't have.
After all, it's the little things
in life that count.
Maybe we'll
have to scrimp and save,
but we'll
have each other.
L-l-I'm not afraid
of being poor.
Stop it, Al!
Why?
What's the matter?
Just... stop it!
George.
What did you think of
when you saw the star?
You wished that you weren't here
with me, didn't you?
You wished that
I was someplace else
where you'd never
have to see me again.
Or maybe you wished
that I was dead.
Is that it?
Did you wish
that I was dead?
No, I didn't!
Now just leave me alone.
Oh.
George.
I know it isn't
easy for you.
I shouldn't
have said that.
Stay where you are.
Aah!
[Loon Calls]
[Gasp]
Who's there?
[Dog Barks]
I'm trying to find...
find the road.
I was hiking
and got lost.
Do you know
where the road is?
It's down the trail
about a quarter of a mile.
[Woof Woof]
[Starter Cranks]
[Motor Starts]
[Dog Barks]
[Woof Woof]
[Woof Woof]
Quiet, boy. Quiet.
Now stay there.
Good morning,
Mr. Marlowe.
Morning, Mack.
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
For you. Coroner.
Yes, Doctor.
Oh?
Just wait a minute,
will you?
Bob, get these facts.
All right now.
Uh, yes.
Young couple drowned.
Now give me
all the facts.
[Dog Barking]
Oh!
Miss Vickers around?
No, she isn't.
I think she's out playing tennis.
In fact, everybody's
gone somewhere.
Thank you.
Mr. Eastman.
Do you feel well?
Yeah, fine.
Hello, George.
Oh, it's been
centuries.
The maid said you were out
playing tennis.
No. I was just
watching them.
I haven't even eaten anything
since you've been away.
Well, hardly anything.
Don't go away
again, George.
Here. Come sit
with me.
How is your mother?
She's much better.
She's much better.
It wasn't as serious
as they thought.
Oh, I'm glad of that.
You look very tired.
I didn't get
much sleep.
I was even a little airsick
on the plane.
Oh, poor George.
Anyway,
I've got good news.
Mother and Daddy
are beginning to melt.
You're winning them over
with your boyish charm.
Maybe they'll let us
make our announcement
when I come home from
school at Christmas.
At Christmas?
Let's run away.
Run away?
Let's run away now.
Right now.
Oh, but darling,
we don't have to.
Not the way things
are going now.
Mother will want
a big wedding.
I've always dreamed
of having one, too,
for as long
as I can remember.
All girls do.
Here now, don't start
getting moody again.
Come on.
You change, and I'll
meet you on the terrace.
Find any identification
on the girl?
Yeah, this
employment card
from the Eastman
Industries.
"Alice Tripp"
or something, huh?
You say the man
gave his name
as Gilbert Edwards?
Yep. You can drag that lake
until you're blue.
You won't find him.
How do you figure that,
bear-bait?
Well, I figure
he left here in an auto,
'cause when I went up to my cabin
last night around suppertime,
there was a coupe parked
off in the woods a piece.
Then about 9:00,
somebody started up that auto
and drove it off
awfully fast.
Hello, George.
Well, hello.
Hey, George.
Hi.
Hello.
Hey, George,
where you been?
Got another woman
stashed around someplace?
Oh, you've been gone
so long.
Hey, can't we be
alone somewhere?
We can take
the speedboat.
Yeah. Come on.
So, they want
to be alone.
Well, we can't
have that.
Come on, Joe,
you lazy-bones.
Go!
Hey, Angela,
how about some company?
Come on,
everybody, get in!
There's no room
for you.
Well, we'll fix that.
Oh, no, you don't!
Aah!
... District Attorney
Frank Marlowe's officers
to investigate further.
Less than an hour ago,
the coroner
informed the press
that although the girl...
marks and bruises
on her face and head
would indicate a struggle
took place.
The district attorney
is believed to have evidence
that the girl's
male companion
may still be alive.
Three boys scouts have
reported that a young man,
visibly upset...
This is the main clue so far
in the deepening mystery...
You look tired,
George.
That's what
I told him.
Why don't you go inside
and take a rest?
I think maybe
that's a good idea.
Excuse me, would you?
Earl, any news
on the drowning at Loon?
The newspapers are
trying to build it up
into a murder case.
Odds are the fellow's still alive,
and he's drowned her.
Frances, you read
too many mysteries.
She was probably
a chatterbox like Frances,
and he picked her up
and threw her overboard!
Aah! Put me down!
I've been looking
for you, sir.
What is it?
Mr. Vickers would like
to see you alone.
He's in the living room,
sir.
Sit down, will you?
I thought that you and I might have
a little chat before dinner.
Care for a drink?
Please.
I'm making it a double.
I'm going to be a little
bit personal, George.
It's about
you and Angela
and this talk going around
about your getting married.
Right now, I don't know whether
I'm for you or against you.
I don't know you
well enough.
I know how you feel,
Mr. Vickers.
Who am I to think
of marrying Angela?
Angela has everything.
Talk of marriage aside,
the fact is that we know
almost nothing
about your background.
There's not much
to know,
but what there is,
I wanted to tell you myself.
We...
My family was...
We were very poor people.
My family devoted
their lives to...
to a kind
of religious work,
conducting
sidewalk services
and... street singing.
I was part of...
part of all that,
until the law came along
and said I ought
to go to school.
But I only went to school
till I was 13 years old.
See, we didn't ever have
any money for anything,
and so I left home.
I was going to do
something about it.
Took any kind of job
I could get.
I was bus boy,
elevator operator,
caddie.
I had no training,
no... no education.
Then I... I came here,
went to work for my uncle.
That's...
my background,
Mr. Vickers.
There's not very much there
to recommend any approval.
But I love Angela more
than anything in the world.
I'd do anything
to make her happy.
Even if it's right that
I shouldn't see her anymore.
Easy, boy.
Forthrightness
is a prime virtue.
Let me tell you,
I admire your frankness.
I should apologize
for eavesdropping...
but I'm glad I listened.
Well, Dad, does that answer
all your questions?
All I ask is that you two
don't do anything... hasty.
Let's get out somewhere.
We'll go
for a drive.
I just want to
be alone with you.
Let's go.
[Dog Barks]
[Woof Woof]
I just can't believe it,
that this horrible thing
could happen to Alice.
She was such a sweet,
quiet girl.
Ever meet any
of her boyfriends?
There was a young man who
took her out once in a while,
but he hasn't
been around in weeks.
And who was he?
It's a small town,
Mr. Kelly,
and any scandal would hurt
my business something awful.
Lady, there will be a scandal
if you don't cooperate.
Well...
now, I never met him,
mind you,
but the girl said
he was an Eastman.
Oh, but it couldn't be.
Not one of the Eastmans.
Hello. Get me the district
attorney's office in Warsaw.
[Siren]
Here we go.
[Siren]
Oh,
he's gaining.
Oh!
Safe!
Safe and sound.
[Police Radio]
Calling Car 41.
Man believed
in your vicinity.
This is the third time this summer,
Miss Vickers.
I can't understand it.
Height 5'10",
hair dark,
complexion fair.
What's your name?
George Eastman.
Now look,
Miss Vickers,
I'd hate to someday
be finding myself
picking up
the pieces
of a pretty girl
like you.
Let's take it easy,
will you?
Anything you say.
Oh, I just love
that officer.
He's so bloodcurdling,
and he writes
such a nice hand.
Darling, what is it?
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
Yes,
you... you must be.
Darling, let's never
leave this place.
Let's just
stay here alone.
Don't let Father
upset you.
I'm the one
who counts.
You're the only one.
The only one.
People are going...
They're going to
say things, I know.
Things about me...
about me. I know.
It's going to make you
stop loving me.
Hush!
Don't talk
like that.
[Distant Siren]
[Mumbling]
[Sirens]
Hmm?
[Sirens Getting Louder]
I was asleep.
You were dreaming.
You were talking.
You said,
"not my fault,"
and then you said something
I couldn't make out,
and then you said,
"Angela,
don't hate me."
That was a bad
dream, George,
a false dream,
because I'll
always love you.
We better go now.
Mother's liable
to send out a posse for us.
[Siren]
You go in.
I'll be along
in a minute.
Every time you leave me
for a minute,
it's like goodbye.
I like to believe it...
means you can't
live without me.
[Approaching Siren]
[Siren]
Is your name George Eastman?
Yes.
You're under arrest.
Why?
What for?
Start walking back down
the road there, bub,
and you'll find out.
Go on, get going.
And no monkey business,
either.
That's him,
all right.
[Dog Barks]
Mr. Marlowe,
here's your baby.
So you're George Eastman.
I suppose you know
what you're charged with.
No.
I suppose you
don't know anything
about the murder
of Alice Tripp.
Well, I'm not guilty.
Oh, come on, son,
we have the evidence.
You're not going
to deny it, are you?
Yes, I deny it.
Well, in that case,
there's nothing to do
but take you over
to the Vickers' house
and see what your
friends have to say.
Please, don't
take me back there.
I'll tell you
all I can,
but don't take me
back there.
I didn't intend to,
son.
I just wanted to see
what you'd have to say.
Take him to Warsaw, boys,
and lock him up.
[Siren]
Now we'll go over
to the Vickers' place
and see what they have
to say about him.
No, simply say
he's a relative.
Came to
the house once.
You got that?
Once.
Have Hollister take his name
off the roster.
Miss Vickers,
you had no inkling
of his relations
with that girl?
No.
And none of you knew
this boy was leading
a double life?
No.
Mr. Marlowe...
if you've
no further questions
for my daughter
and me,
will you excuse us?
Of course.
Mr. Vickers,
I have no desire
to harass
an innocent person,
and I'd like to keep
your daughter's name
free of scandal,
but if the newspapers get
hold of her involvement...
I'll keep her name
out of the newspapers.
You keep her name
out of the trial.
That may not
be possible.
The defense
would have to agree to it.
The defense
will agree to it.
I'll see to that.
I'll engage
the boy's lawyers,
and if it appears
he's innocent,
I'll spend $ 100,000
to defend him.
And if he's guilty?
If he is guilty,
I won't spend a single cent
to save him from
the electric chair.
Thank you, Mother.
Thank you, Lulu.
I want you
to tell me...
I think that's enough
for today.
I guess
you're right.
Mr. Bellows...
has there been
any word from...
From Miss Vickers?
No, George.
You see,
when Mr. Eastman
engaged us
to defend you,
we made an agreement
with the district attorney
not to drag Miss Vickers
into the case
unnecessarily.
Oh... of course.
This was in your
interest, too.
Her appearance on the stand
would be irrelevant,
and I feel it might be
damaging for you, too.
We'll be back.
"After I got her
out on the lake,
"I couldn't
go through with it.
Then the boat
turned over."
You know, Art,
he sold me.
I believe his story.
No more newspapers,
Lulu.
Remember, I told you.
[Shouting]
[Gavel Pounds]
The people of this state
charge that the crime of
murder in the first degree
has been committed by
the prisoner at the bar...
George Eastman.
[Gavel Pounds]
They charge that this same
George Eastman willfully,
and with malice and cruelty
and deception,
murdered,
then sought to conceal
from the knowledge
and justice of the world,
the body of Alice Tripp.
It will be for you,
ladies and gentlemen,
to decide what should
be done with this man
who has flouted
every moral law,
broken every commandment,
who has crowned
his infamy...
with murder.
Ahem.
What were Alice's feelings
for this defendant?
She was
in love with him.
Everybody knew that.
What was this rule,
exactly, Mr. Whiting?
It was to keep
the staff members
from fooling around
with the girls working there.
One night last August,
I called Alice
to the telephone.
It was him calling.
Doctor...
you never saw
this young man?
No, but after
she left my office,
she talked
for a long time
in some man's coupe.
Objection!
Sustained.
Along about 9:00,
he stumbled into my camp.
His clothes were wet,
and he looked scared.
Well, this man was
at the bus station
with this girl.
They were quarreling,
and she said she
wouldn't leave the depot
unless he promised.
Coroner,
did you conclude
that violence
had been done to Miss Tripp
prior to her death
by drowning?
Well, apparently
the young woman
had been struck
by a dull instrument
with sufficient force
to stun her.
I told him there wasn't
nobody else on the lake.
Then he signed the name
Gilbert Edwards.
Having signed
a false name,
isn't it a fact
he then proceeded
to ensure that
whatever occurred on the lake
would be observed
by no one?
I object, Your Honor.
No one, that is,
except
the unfortunate girl
expecting him to take
her to the altar,
the girl he drowned?
The prosecution
must not make these inferences.
I withdraw the question.
The people rest.
This boy is on trial
for the act of murder,
not for the thought
of murder.
Between the idea
and the deed,
there's a world
of difference,
and if you find this boy
guilty in desire,
but not guilty
in deed...
then he must walk
out of this courtroom
as free as you or I.
However,
since the prosecutor
lacked evidence...
he's given you
prejudice.
Lacking facts,
he's given you fantasy.
Of all the witnesses
he's paraded before you,
not one actually saw
what happened.
I will now call to
the stand an eyewitness,
the only eyewitness,
the only one
who knows the truth,
the whole truth.
George Eastman,
will you please
take the stand?
[Loon Calls]
And when
we got to the lake,
I suggested we go rowing
before it got dark.
Now, tell me,
George,
why did you give
a false name to the boat keeper?
We were going to spend
the night at the lodge,
and we weren't married,
so I thought
it would be better
if we didn't give
our right names.
Well, why, at this time,
did you engage the boat
to row the girl
out onto the lake?
In the back
of my mind
was the thought
of drowning her...
[Crowd Murmurs]
[Gavel Pounds]
But I didn't want to
think such things.
I couldn't help myself!
I couldn't.
So what happened after you
rowed out onto the lake?
I knew then that
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't go
through with it.
And then you had
a change of heart.
I object.
He's leading
the witness.
Objection sustained.
Counsel will refrain
from leading the witness.
Yes, Your Honor.
What happened then,
George?
Well, uh...
that was when we decided
we ought to get back
to the lodge.
She started talking about...
about our getting married
and what our life together
would be like.
What was your
reaction to that,
to her talking
that way?
She just looked at me.
She knew
it was hopeless.
She accused me
of wishing she was dead.
Did you, George?
Did you wish she were dead?
No, I didn't.
I wasn't thinking
of that anymore.
What were you thinking
of at that moment?
I was thinking
of somebody else.
Another girl.
You were thinking that
this other girl and her world
were lost to you forever.
What did you say
to Alice's accusation?
I told her
it wasn't true.
I didn't
want her to die.
Wasn't she alarmed
or frightened?
She even said,
"poor George."
Go on.
And then she
started toward me
from the back
of the boat.
I told her
to stay where she was,
but she didn't.
She... She kept coming
toward me,
and then she stumbled
and started to fall.
I started to get up,
and then everything
turned over.
In a second,
we were in the water.
I was stunned.
Something must have
hit me as I fell in.
It all happened so fast
I didn't know
what I was doing.
George...
was Alice conscious
when she fell into the water?
Yes. I could
hear her scream,
but I couldn't
see her
'cause she was on
the other side of the boat.
So I swam around
to the other side,
and she was...
When I got there...
she'd gone down.
I never saw her again.
Do you solemnly swear
before God
that you didn't
strike Alice Tripp?
I do. I swear.
And that you didn't throw
her into that lake?
I did not.
And that it was an accident
undesired by you.
I do!
I do.
I do.
That's all, Your Honor.
Eastman, that night when you
left that dinner party
at the house
at Bride's Lake
to meet Alice Tripp
in the bus station,
do you remember leaving
anything behind you?
No, I don't.
I don't remember
leaving anything.
I'm referring to your heart,
Eastman.
Did you leave that
behind you?
Did you, Eastman?
Out there in that terrace
in the moonlight?
You left behind,
didn't you,
the girl you loved,
and with her, your
hopes, your ambitions,
your dreams?
Didn't you, Eastman?
You left behind everything
you ever wanted,
including the girl
you loved?
But you planned to return to it,
didn't you, Eastman?
Answer me.
Yes.
Eastman, when you told them
all that night
that you were going
to visit your mother,
you were lying,
weren't you?
Yes.
When you gave the boat keeper
a false name,
you were lying again,
weren't you?
Yes.
When you drove up
to Loon Lake,
what reason did you give
Alice Tripp
for parking so far away
from the lodge?
Because we were
out of gas.
Weren't you
lying again?
Yes.
Lies.
Isn't it a fact
that every move you made
was built on lies?
Yet now when you're facing
the electric chair,
suddenly you can't tell
anything but the truth.
All the same,
it's true.
I didn't kill her.
So you persist in lying
about that, too.
Well, we'll see.
Eastman, I want you
to step into the boat
and show the jury
exactly what happened
when the boat
overturned.
Take the same position
you had
at the time
of the drowning.
Now, Eastman,
when the girl rose
to come toward you,
did she stumble
about there?
Speak up.
Yes.
And then?
And then she fell sideways
into the water.
So did I.
And then what happened?
The boat turned over
on top of us.
What happened then?
I couldn't see
very clearly.
There was a thud,
as if the edge
of the boat
hit her
on the head.
Very likely.
After this
accidental blow
and you're both
in the water,
how far apart were you
when you came up?
I don't know exactly.
If you were trying
to grab her,
you couldn't have been
more than a yard apart.
It was farther
than that.
As far from there
to the jury box
or halfway or what?
About as far as
from here to the jury box.
Not really.
You fell in together,
and came up
nearly 20 feet apart.
That's how
I remember it.
Why couldn't you swim
toward her instead of away?
I don't know.
Step over here.
Now, was the boat
as far as from here
to the bailiff?
I guess so.
I don't know.
You couldn't swim
this little distance
to this poor weak girl
and buoy her up to the boat
just 15 feet away?
You know you're lying!
She was drowning,
and you let her!
She was sitting there
defenseless,
you picked up this oar,
and you crashed it down
on that poor girl's head!
[Gavel Pounds]
You pushed that poor girl
into the lake.
You watched her
drown.
Isn't that
the truth?
No.
That's all, Your Honor.
...by the premature
adoption
of an extreme belief
and creed.
It is well
to understand this
in looking toward
the responsibilities
of adult life,
in particular,
the married state,
when the student
will emerge
from the sheltered life
into a world
of grownup problems
for the first time.
It is only then
that he or she
will view
the enthusiasms of youth
in the perspective
of genuine problems,
as opposed
to the imagined problems,
which are
the frequent products
of a sheltered immaturity.
It is at this time
that the sometimes hastily
adopted beliefs of youth
are bound to be
insufficient...
Has the jury
reached a verdict?
We...
Ahem.
We have, Your Honor.
The defendant
will rise.
The clerk
will read the verdict.
We, the jury,
find the defendant,
George Eastman,
guilty of murder
in the first degree.
[Gavel Pounds]
Order in the court!
[Bird Chirps]
Hello,
Mrs. Eastman.
Mama.
My boy.
Did you see
the governor?
It's no use.
The governor
couldn't be moved.
Your mother's
done everything
a mother could do,
George.
That I know.
Death is
a little thing, George.
You mustn't be afraid
of it.
You must fear now only
for your immortal soul.
If that sin is
on your soul, my son,
you must make your peace
with God.
I don't believe
I'm guilty of all this.
I don't know.
I wish I knew.
If you are guilty,
then I, too, am guilty.
I must share your guilt.
Oh, Mama,
don't blame yourself.
You know, they say
only God and ourselves
know what our sins
and sorrows are.
Perhaps in this case,
only God knows.
George...
perhaps you've hidden
the full truth of this
even from yourself.
I don't want
to hide anything.
I want to know.
George, there's one thing
you've never told anyone.
Even yourself.
There's one point
in your story
that holds the answer
you're looking for.
Yes.
When you were on the lake
with that poor girl,
and the boat capsized,
and there was a moment when
you might have saved her...
I wanted to save her.
But I just couldn't.
But whom were you
thinking of?
Who were you thinking of
just at that moment?
Were you thinking
of Alice?
Or were you thinking
of the other girl?
Then... in your heart,
it was murder, George.
God bless you, my boy.
God forgive me
if I've failed you.
[Bird Chirps]
[Chirp]
I came to see you.
I thought lots
about you, George.
All the time.
I went away
to school to learn.
I don't think
I learned very much.
I love you, George.
I wanted you
to know that.
[Chirp]
Well, I...
I...
I guess there's
nothing more to say.
I know something now
that I didn't know before.
I am guilty
of a lot of things...
most of what
they say of me.
All the same...
I'll go on loving you...
for as long as I live.
Love me for the time
I have left,
then forget me.
Goodbye, George.
It seems like
we always spend
the best part
of our time...
just saying goodbye.
[Ticking]
[Priest] In my Father's house
are many mansions.
I go to prepare
a place for you.
And I will receive you
unto Myself.
Where I am,
ye may be also.
You'll have to go now, son.
I am the resurrection
and the life.
He who believeth
in Me...
Come on, son.
Though he were dead,
yet shall he live,
and whosoever liveth
and believeth in Me
shall never die.
So long, kid.
God bless you, son.
Hope you find
a better world than this.
Goodbye, George.
I'll be seeing you.
