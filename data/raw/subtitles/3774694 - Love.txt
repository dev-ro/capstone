(Relaxing music)
(Soft moaning)
(Alarm ringing)
[Voiceover] Nora?
[Gaspar] Papa?
[Voiceover] What time is it?
Oh what did I do last night?
Why did I take that shit?
(Gaspar crying)
Why is he moaning?
Today is shit.
Is the whole year gonna be like
this?
(Yawning)
I think I'm still high.
[Murphy] Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
[Omi] Murphy?
[Gaspar] Happy New Year.
[Murphy] Happy New Year.
[Voiceover] I should've
brushed my teeth.
I smell like shit.
He thinks his father is filthy.
But I'm not.
[Murphy] Who's that?
Who's that?
Who's that right there?
[Gaspar] Mama.
(Groaning)
[Voiceover] Why is
Electra's mother calling me?
[Gaspar] Mama.
[Voiceover] Oh my God,
this is a nightmare.
I wish I didn't exist right now.
This place is a cage.
So early.
It seems strange that
she would call right now.
Not a good sign.
[Answering Machine] (speaking
French).
[Voiceover] Hi, this
is Electra's mother.
Sorry to bother you on
a first of January but,
I haven't had news from my
daughter for the last two
months.
[Omi] Baby, you want some tea
or coffee?
[Voiceover] Shit, this is not
good.
It sounds like bad news.
It seems so long ago.
It seems like another lifetime.
Two years.
I miss her.
I miss her so much.
I wish she was here right now.
(Phone ringing)
[Voiceover] Hello?
Nora.
[Voiceover] Yes, who is it?
Who is it?
[Murphy] It's Murphy.
How are you?
[Voiceover] What do you want?
[Murphy] Uhm...
I've been trying to get a hold
of Electra
And I've been calling her, and,
She hasn't been answering, I was
wondering
If maybe she got a new phone?
[Voiceover] I won't tell
you, you should be ashamed!
You destroyed everything!
[Murphy] Listen, can you
please...
[Voiceover] You have
destroyed my daughter,
My only daughter!
[Murphy] Can you please
just give me her number
So I can speak with her, any
way at all, then I can just...
[Voiceover] What do you think?
You're just garbage, you
have always been a liar!
[Murphy] Listen, you need
to understand that I love
Your daughter very much,
and it's very important
That I talk to her.
[Voiceover] Leave us alone, go
to hell!
[Murphy] Hello, hello?
[Voiceover] Hi, this
is Electra's mother.
Sorry to bother you on a first
of January,
But I haven't had news from my
daughter
For the last two months,
And I'm worried.
And I know that she was
In a suicidal mood, if you can
call me,
It would be nice, I'm very, very
worried,
Thank you.
Who was it?
[Voiceover] I wish she'd just
shut up.
Who is hungry?
Papa!
Thank you.
(Gaspar playfully chattering)
You have become a bit,
a little bit fat no?
[Voiceover] Yeah, I'm fat.
Don't ya?
[Voiceover] My dick is fat.
She's so bitter sometimes.
I think Daddy is pregnant.
[Voiceover] There is
nothing for me here.
Except for this little guy.
I hope she won't turn him gay.
[Omi] Do you know how babies
like you
Come to this world?
(Heavy moaning)
(frolicking music)
What happened?
It broke.
But did you come?
(Heaving)
(frolicking music)
Murphy?
I need to tell you something.
I think I'm pregnant.
I took a pregnancy test today.
And it was positive.
You wanna see it?
Two stripes means positive.
Can we do another one?
Yeah, sure.
Oh...
(Calming music)
Who was that on the phone?
[Voiceover] How can I lie to
her?
It was the mother of an old
friend.
Are you sure?
[Voiceover] Maybe I should
tell her.
Sometimes it's better not to
lie.
I'm sick of this bitch.
Go take care of the baby,
And leave me alone, please.
She tricked me, I know she did.
Living with a woman,
Is like sharing a bed with the
CIA.
Nothing is secret.
This used to be my apartment.
I used to be happy here.
It doesn't feel like my place
anymore.
I'm always looking over my
shoulder now.
My last secret corner.
My last private space.
The only thing left of my life.
I remember when she gave me
this.
Let's try to protect,
protect each other.
Opium.
Do you wanna take it now?
No.
Keep it for...
If something bad happen in your
life,
And I'm not there.
It will protect you.
Okay?
What's wrong?
Omi is pregnant.
What?
Omi is pregnant?
Wow.
Of who?
Of who?
(Spits)
Eat your shit and die.
(Door slamming shut)
(Club music)
That's her over there man, you
see her?
I don't give a fuck,
let it go, all right?
What?
It's done, you're done
with her, it's done.
Who is she dancing with?
Who cares?
- Who cares, what are you
talking about?
- Who gives a fuck?
Let's go, all right?
Electra!
Electra, I wanna talk to you!
Electra hey, I wanna talk to
you!
(Speaking French)
Leave me alone!
(Shouting over each other)
Hey, what you did to me,
May just have pissed me off,
but...
No, (music drowns out
Electra).
I need to talk to you!
(Shouting over each other)
Don't touch me!
Don't touch you, who the fuck
is that?
Go away from me, you're
fucking
Having a baby with a slut.
I didn't want this to happen,
I didn't want this just to
happen!
Why won't you have an
abortion?
We made a promise together.
Yeah, and you failed on that!
I belong to you!
You're a loser!
You belong to me!
You're a loser!
I wanna have a baby with you!
You're a loser like...
I love you!
Go home!
I love you!
You have never loved me!
[Murphy] Hey, fuck off, hey,
Electra!
(Music drowns out Electra)
You're fucking with me!
I'm not fucking
with you,
I want to be alone!
Do you see that?
No!
Disappear from my life!
You are a fucking selfish
Cruel person, you're killing me,
You're going to kill me.
[Murphy] I love you so much.
I hate you!
I love you so much.
I hate you!
I love you...
I'm the one that's hurting right
now.
(Sad music)
Electra, I love you, do you hear
me?
I love you!
I know you're listening to me!
Electra, I know you can hear
this!
Answer me, please!
Please!
(Sad music)
Electra open the door!
Electra open the door!
(Crying)
Open the door, baby.
Please open the door, you

(Crying)
Open the door, you selfish cunt!
Please open the door!
(Crying)
No...
No...
Go away!
Go away, go!
Piss off now!
(Screaming)
(metal music)
(Door banging)
(screaming)
You're a piece of shit!
You're a piece of shit!
You're an asshole!
You piece of shit!
I'm going to fucking kill you.
(Murphy is drowned out by the
music)
Chill, relax Bro.
No!
[Murphy] You fucking junkie!
(Screaming)
(scuffling)
No, no!
No, no!
(door banging)
No, no!

(Metal music)
Hey Julio.

You know what.
[Murphy] No no, no, I don't

Let me talk, hey

[Murphy] Tell me, jealous of

[Voiceover] Relax.
[Murphy] Fucking explain it to
me.
Are you fucking my girlfriend?
[Voiceover] No, I'm not

[Murphy] Are you fucking my
girlfriend?
[Voiceover] No, no man.
But she likes coke, what I can

[Murphy] She likes coke?
[Voiceover] Yeah, you brought
her there.
[Murphy] So what, you're
doing blow with her?
[Voiceover] You put her there

You fucking put her there.
[Murphy] I put her there?
[Voiceover] Yeah, you put her
there.
[Murphy] Really, how does that
work?
[Voiceover] You put her up to
it.
Explain that to me, explain it
to me
You sick little fuck, you little
weasel.
[Voiceover] Hey, hey.
Where the fuck is she?
[Voiceover] Listen, that's
what she says all the time,
You gave her the first line,
And then you start
fucking all these girls,
Cheating on her, so what's up,

Be a man about it, man up.
Stay away from her.
Don't be a pussy and start
smashing her.
I knew you...
[Murphy] Don't be a what?
[Voiceover] Hey listen buddy...
[Murphy] I don't even know
what to say
To you right now.
You better pray to God we
don't run into each other.
[Voiceover] Pfft, okay,
okay, you know what?
[Murphy] What, what?
[Voiceover] Just let it
go, and just tell your mom
That you lost a friend and
you lost your girlfriend.
[Murphy] Hey, hey, you

Find you, I'm gonna

And I'm gonna shove 'em

Your head explodes.

[Murphy] Needle dick, really?
[Voiceover] Hey listen,

I got some people to see, peace.
Don't fucking hang up the

Do not hang up the fucking

Listen to me, listen to me,
If you fucking touch my

Lay one fucking finger on her,

I will fucking rip your head

[Voiceover] All right,
peace bro, have a good night.
Julio, Julio.
Don't hang up the phone, Julio.
(Sad music)
I love you.
(Gaspar crying)
[Voiceover] Me too.
(Gaspar crying)
Where are you going?
I don't know, out.
(Gaspar crying)
You haven't really been here all
day,
Where are you?
Electra's mother called.
She hasn't heard from her in
three months.
Oh, Electra.
[Murphy] She's worried
about her, and I think
She might've hurt herself.
You know what?
Take care of your past, and
then I take care of your future.
(Gaspar crying)
(Door slamming shut)
[Voiceover] She said we
could do anything together.
But there's one thing we never
did.
(Melancholic music)
(Gaspar playfully chirping)
We never made a baby.
No.
Can you show me?
How tender you can be?
(Soft moaning)
(melancholic music)
Did you ever try sex
On opium?
No.
It's great.
Very chill.
What's the best?
Opium.
That's the best sex?
Hmm-mm.
[Voiceover] Electra...
This is the only way we can be
close.
Having you inside me again.
(Sad music)
Now you're inside.
I miss you.
Electra?
Hmm?
What is your ultimate fantasy?
Sex-wise?
Sure.
Fuck with another girl, and
you.
Fuck with another girl?
And me.
This is my dream too.
A blond, pretty.
Oh, blond?
Nice girl.
You like blond girls?
(Speaking French)
[Omi] Hi.
Do you speak English?
[Omi] Yeah I speak English.
Are you the new neighbor?
[Omi] Yes, I just moved in.
Cool.
Yeah, (giggling), yeah,
So I guess, see you around.
Yes.
Yeah, (giggling), bye.
Hi.
[Electra] Hey.
Hey.
How are you?
[Murphy] Good.
Yeah?
[Electra] Do you wanna hang
out later?
Hmm?
Yeah.
[Electra] We can go eat
something.
Yeah, cool.
Thank you, yeah, thank you
so much for inviting me.
[Murphy] Oh come on.
[Electra] Oh, it's nothing.
The pleasure is all ours.
(Giggles)
So do you have family here?
No, I haven't, no.
Where are your parents?
Uh, I don't know.
I was an accident, so.
What do you mean?
Well, I've, they
didn't want me, kind of.
She wanted, your mother wanted
to,
Have an abortion, like that?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
She has acted like that
all of her life, so,
And I never knew my dad, so
yeah.
(Sighs) Did you ever have an
abortion?
No.
Good.
Me neither.
Okay, I'm happy to hear that.
Nothing like...
Although, I would have
to say I am pro-choice.
Really?
Yeah.
And you're not?
I'm pro-life.
You're pro-life?
Yeah!
Really?
Well otherwise I wouldn't be
here.
Okay so...
You're against abortion,
but you're cool with
People killing animals
and then eating them?
Yeah but that's...
Ah, that's two different things.
You know, like, it's part
of nature to eat meat,
You know, you come here,
eat meat, make babies.
(Laughs)
Yeah, don't you agree?
I guess so.
What about drugs, are you
pro-drugs?
Do you like getting high?
Well, it's also really
natural to smoke, I think,
They have been smoking a
thousand years,
A million years, like they
found a little leaf, like...
Do you wanna smoke a natural
joint
Over at our place, after this?
Yeah, I would love to.
(Melancholic music)
You're a really sweet couple.
You are a really sweet
neighbor.
How old are you?
Hmm, 17.
17?
Yes.
Like, soon.
I fucking love Europe.
(Laughing)
Give me that.
(Relaxing music)
(soft moaning)
(Phone dialing)
[Voiceover] Hi, this
is Nora's voicemail.
You can leave a message
after the beep tone.
Please do know that I'll be out
of Paris
Until the fifth of January.
I wish you all a very happy New
Year.
(Speaking French)
Hey, this is Murphy.
I'm calling you back.
I haven't heard from Electra
In quite a while.
But I'm just as worried as you
are.
So uhm, maybe you could
give me her new number
Or I could call some of
Of her old friends?
Call me back when you get this,
please,
All right, bye.
[Voiceover] I'm a loser.
Yeah, just a dick.
And a dick has no brain.
A dick has only one purpose.
To fuck.
And I fucked it all up.
Yeah.
I'm good at one thing.
Fucking things up.
But she was hot.
I couldn't resist.
I had to get inside there.
(Calming music)
(Whistling)
[Omi] Hi.
Hey.
[Omi] How are you?
Good, you?
[Omi] Yeah.
Cool.
[Omi] Where's Electra?
She's not here this weekend.
[Omi] Would you like to come
over?
(Moves into slow soft rock
music)
(Soft moaning)
[Voiceover] I'm really stoned
right now.
Electra, I wish you were here.
Taking opium with me.
My body feels amazing.
And the rain is sweet.
Sweet...
Sweet...
If we had a baby,
What would you name it?
[Electra] And you?
If it was a boy?
Maybe Gaspar.
[Electra] Gaspar?
Yeah.
(Slow soft rock music)
Gaspar.
You wanna call it Gaspar?
Yeah.
Gaspar.
(Slow soft rock music)
[Voiceover] I need to sit up.
I'm too stoned.
Oh God I miss her.
I need to see her face again.
Or I'm never happy.
Yeah...
Love is strange.
I feel like a junkie.
How can something so wonderful,
Bring such great pain.
Maybe it's better to never love
at all.
(Slow soft rock music)
If you die,
I'll have these images to
remember you by.
I don't want to die.
I'll cry.
[Voiceover] Hello, this is
Noe International Art Gallery.
We are open from Tuesday
to Saturday from 10:00 AM
To 7:00 PM.
Please leave a message after the
tone,
We will call you back as soon as
possible.
(Beeping)
[Murphy] Hey this is Murphy.
Uhm, trying to get a hold of
you,
I haven't heard from Electra
In a long time and uhm,
Just call me back, when you get
this,
Then I can see if I can help
find her.
Okay, thank you, bye.
[Voiceover] It's true she had
issues.
It's true she was a junkie.
I would forgive everything,
I will always love her,
If she would forgive me.
Please Electra, come back to me.
Come back, come back,
Come back.
(Piano music)
I wanna be in your arms.
I want you to hug me.
To hold me.
Please hug me.
Please hold me.
(Soft moaning)
[Electra] You're so hard this
morning.
Can I fuck you?
(Soft moaning)
(piano music)
I wanna make movies out of
blood,
Sperm and tears.
(Laughs) That's so sweet.
This is like the essence of
life.
I think movies should contain
that,
Or should be made of that.
Which is your favorite movie?
2001.
What do you think of this movie?
Oh, I really never saw.
You've never seen 2001?
What is wrong with you?
You've never seen this movie?
Will you show me?
Yes, I have to!
You're ignorant, I need
to show you the light.
This is like the reason
I wanna be a director.
But I like poetry too.
Yeah?
You want to hear my favorite
poem?
Definitely.
I think it goes something
like,
"The woods are lovely, dark and
deep,"
"But I have promises to keep,"
"And miles to go before I sleep,"
"And miles to go before I
sleep."
What do you think of this
place?
It's cool right?
I love it.
(Relaxing, mysterious music)
What if I got you pregnant?
I think I would be happy.
You think?
If we can make more than one.
You want more?
Seven.
Seven?
This is a reasonable number?
Lucky number.
What are we gonna do
with all these kids?
Start a farm?
A big happy family, that
would make your mom happy,
I think.
I don't really talk about her.
And I'm not sure I can introduce
You to my father.
I think that you are too crazy.
Uh, and what about you
princess?
He doesn't know I drink.
You drink just as much as I
do.
He thinks I'm an angel.
Is he conservative?
Religious?
Electra has a Daddy complex.
I love Paris.
I don't like my past here.
My last five years, but, I like
Paris.
You don't like your past year?
Maybe I don't like my past in
general.
But I see a great future coming.
Long life?
Long life behind you.
It's hard to see what's ahead.
Great love.
I think you should (mumbling).
(Calming music)
Tell me about your
ex-boyfriend.
I loved him a lot.
What was his name?
Noe.
He was nice.
But we don't talk anymore.
He loved me.
He was old, but he wanted
younger.
Younger than you?
Yes.
And your ex-girlfriend?
(Scoffs)
(Soft moaning)
(calming music)
Lucille?
Hmm-mm?
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.
Do you have a nice apartment in
Paris?
Yeah.
Why?
I was just wondering if,
If I came there, if I could stay
with you?
You're the love of my life.
Hey?
Can I tell you a secret?
(Soft moaning)
What is your secret?
I forgot.
(Giggling)
I have a secret.
Yes?
So this is your ex's gallery?
It is.
It's huge.
Electra.
Oh.
Good to see you.
[Electra] You too.
How are you?
Fine.
Your brother, I guess?
No, it's Murphy, my boyfriend.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you.
I told you about him.
You're the artist?
Filmmaker.
Aha, filmmaker.
And what do you do?
I'm making movies.
Ah, here in Paris or in New
York?
Here, Paris.
So you're here for a while?
For a while.
Welcome, welcome.
- [Electra] So?
- [Noe] So, life is good?
Yeah.
Have you been traveling lately?
Yeah, as usual.
Bangkok, with my kids.
It was fun.
Wife and kids?
Hey, I wanna introduce you to
the guy,
Wanna come?
Yeah, yeah.
Can I bring him to the
party you told me about?
Of course?
Oh there's a party?
Yeah next week.
Be my guest.
And bring me your movies one
day.
All right.
Come, come.
[Murphy] Piece of shit.
You're a bitch.
Hey...
[Murphy] Don't touch me.
Come on.
He's a nice guy,
And don't be like so jealous,
It's over between me and him.
Well I hope you got a good
contract.
I hope he pays you a lot.
He just introduced me
to a nice guy, come on.
He wants to fuck you.
No, he, it's over.
Do you think we will
stay together forever?
[Murphy] Forever is a long
time,
I should hope so.
Forever is a long time?
You're not planning to?
Oh...
(Giggling)
What?
I'm a very peaceful person
If you tell me about your
desire.
We have to make a promise,
That from now on,
We're gonna be the greatest
couple
That ever lived.
We were already.
What can we do?
Talk straight away about our
feelings,
Say to each other what we want
to do.
You can do whatever you
want if you ask me to.
Anything I want?
Yes, you can have a lot of
freedom if you ask me, go.
Yes?
Yes.
Do you still love me?
You know I do.
Do you still love me?
Yes, are you drunk?
(Giggling)
I just want a
Sincere answer.
I fucking love you.
I feel it.
[Murphy] Hey, drink.
You know what?
No?
What?
[Murphy] Do you wanna be in my
movie?
(Relaxing music)
Show me your star-face.
Do you, do you love me?
[Murphy] I love you.
Hey.
Will you make me look good?
Even when I'm not a good person?
I'm not a good person.
[Murphy] You're not a good
person?
Never, make me look like a
good person.
[Murphy] What?
(Laughing)
Hey.
Play the game!
[Murphy] I'm playing the game!
You're not.
Down and have fun.
That ain't even a question!
You're so stupid, you
just took the last picture
You had in your camera.
I think, I have a few more.
Yeah, so, I think, (mumbling),
romantic.
Do you know what I think about
you?
[Murphy] What?
[Electra] You're an amazing
guy...
[Murphy] But?
[Electra] Oh no but.
You're an amazing guy.
[Murphy] But?
You are one amazing guy.
Who doesn't know what love
means.
Electra?
(Relaxing music)
I'm so glad I met you.
(Relaxing music)
So anyway, Julio...
Listen, I was wondering
if you heard from Electra?
[Voiceover] No, not for a long
time, no,
She kinda disappeared.
And now I'm in rehab.
[Murphy] You're in rehab?
[Voiceover] Yeah, so
I haven't talked to her,
I haven't seen her.
She was hanging out with Farid
and Kemal,
And Farid had problems with the
police.
[Murphy] Yeah.
[Voiceover] But uhm
listen, I'm pretty hungover,
I don't do drugs anymore,
but I got drunk last night,
And I'm not alone, so I'll call
you later.
[Murphy] Okay.
[Voiceover] But hey, stay away
from her.
Thank you, I'm glad to see
you,
And to meet one of your friends,
finally.
So, Murphy,
What are you doing in Paris?
[Murphy] I'm a filmmaker.
Oh.
He's studying.
[Murphy] I'm studying, still
yeah.
Hmm-mm.
So you're an artist?
[Murphy] Exactly.
Like my daughter.
Mama likes art.
Yeah, I do.
And how did you meet each other?
In a party, my school party in
a park.
How long ago?
[Murphy] A bit.
Okay, how interesting.
I'll come back in a second,
sorry.
I'd like to ask you a
question.
[Murphy] Sure.
I saw drugs, I think cocaine,
At Electra's apartment.
[Murphy] Really?
I found some, yeah.
[Murphy] But she's
not that kind of girl.
Of course she's not.
Of course not.
That's why I'm asking you.
Do you do drugs?
[Murphy] Me?
Yeah.
[Murphy] No, never.
How did you get it?
(Anticipatory music)
(sniffing)
What?
So I can get some more?
It's not dirty.
Who gave it to you?
Julio.
Julio?
My Julio?
Yeah, your friend Julio.
That's weird.
Why?
How did you get Julio's
number?
I wasn't...
You're paranoid, do you know?
I took it from your phone.
Can we buy some more?
I don't got anymore.
No more coke.
No more coke.
Baby, he's not a drug
dealer, he's our friend.
Do you have, dear friend,
Something else to give us?
I do have something else
actually.
I got some XTC.
That'll do.
Oh, blue.
Two each.
Two each.
Very well, here's two.
What about taking one now?
Hey!
Trust me, will you?
Let's break one and enjoy it.
It is for your own protection.
It is for your own protection?
Now let's see.
You know, my ex-girlfriend,
The shaman, she's been
chilling with the shaman
A lot lately.
She invited us to go on a
spiritual journey with her.
Maybe it's time to purge
The body, cleanse the soul.
Are you asking?
Just don't shit your pants
bro.
You'll be all right.
This is not a drug.
Don't misunderstand me, but,
You have to look further.
This is a...
This is like a head teacher
Showing you the reality,
I mean, what we see is not
the...
Yuyo, hi.
(Speaking French)
(Serene music)
(Puking)
(Groaning)
(Serene music)
(Groaning)
(Melancholic music)
Do you know what my
biggest dream in life is?
My biggest dream is to make a
movie
That truly depicts sentimental
sexuality.
She doesn't care, she has heard
this a million times before.
Yeah I like it.
You like it?
Yeah.
Why, why haven't we seen this
in cinema?
Yeah, right, I agree.
I'm sentimental.
We should birth babies.
Yeah, I agree with you.
Are you an actress?
Yeah.
What's your name?
Paula.
Lola?
Yeah, Paula, I'm French,
But I love to speak English.
Yeah, well it's very good.
Yeah.
What's the best thing in life?
Love.
Love.
And then after that?
Sex! (Laughs)
Yes and then you combine the
two,
And sex while you're in love.
That's the best thing.
I'm sorry, do you have a
cigarette?
I wanna see that!
Yeah.
I want a cigarette.
I don't have one.
No, no, it's cool.
Okay, thank you.
You know, I need to show you
something.
I've gotta show you something.
Okay, sure.
Follow me, follow
me, come, come with me.
Baby, baby I like you.
You're so nice.
(Electronic music)
You look so nice.
That's not coke.
Oh I know.
I have a girlfriend.
Yeah, me too.
You don't have to worry.
You want me?
Can you keep a secret?
I love secrets.
The other way.
(Laughs) Sorry, I'm drunk.
(Soft moaning)
(Door knocking)
(Door knocking)
(Soft moaning)
(Electronic music)
(Music drowns out speech)
Hey.
Don't touch me.
Are you okay?
What the fuck were you
doing with this girl?
She wanted to do coke.
Well what about your fly?
What?
Close your fly.
Oh shit...
(Electronic music)
You know I was knocking.
The music's loud.
Yeah, but not enough
To make me not hear what you
were doing.
What are you talking about?
I hear you!
Ah, okay, what are you talking
about?
You were fucking another girl.
No, I wasn't, no.
You just wanted a kiss,
As every fucking man said.
I cheated on you with Noe.
What?
What?
I cheat...
With who?
With Noe.
With Noe, when?
When were you planning on
telling me this?
I didn't want to tell
you this because I...
That's not what I asked you,
I said, when were you
planning on telling me this?
I was afraid that you would...
Please stop.
I told you!
Would you then reveal to me that
You were fucking your
ex-boyfriend.
It's your fault!
It's my fault, how so?
It's your fucking fault!
Please explain to me,
because I fucking seeing,
I'm so stupid that I...
(Speaking French)
That I actually believed
that you were anything
But a fucking whore,
which is what you are.
You...
You are not a painter,
you have no talent,
You will never, ever
sell a fucking painting
In your whole life, you
are so fucking stupid
To believe that this piece of
shit
Will ever sell one of your
worthless pieces of bullshit!
Believes in my fucking
painting!
You have no talent!
And he was nicer than you
anyway!
You have no talent!
He was warm!
I actually like him better
than you,
Because at least he's honest,
At least he can do one
thing, which is trick
A stupid cunt like yourself.
Ah, so he was like you then!
You can't even suck a cock
right.
One of the fucking men
who just wanted to fuck me
Because I'm pretty.
And you know what, you will
never, ever,
Be a good mother, ever!
You will never be able to mother
a child,
Because you are a venomous cunt.
I think we will not
understand each other then.
(Mumbling) family.
(Weeping)
(Mumbling) that exists.
(Heavy moaning)
(upbeat music)
This is your dream?
No this is becoming a fucking
nightmare.
This is your dream?
Hey, chill down, you wanted to
come.
Why didn't you stay at home?
These bourgeois French fucks.
Why did you come dressed like
that?
With their heads so far up
their asses.
You're being a pain.
It's nauseating.
In the fucking ass, control
yourself.
I wanna vomit.
Stop drinking, yeah go to the
toilet,
Go, I'll take a taxi, go home
and sleep.
I'm having a good time.
Yeah, (mumbling).
Where are you going, princess?
Come on.
Hey.
All right, we will go home.
I'm having a good time.
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
Cognac?
Hey, hey, hey.
He looks drunk.
Please, please, please stop
it.
Hey come on, let's go home.
Remember me?
[Electra] Hey come on.
Of course I remember you, but,
You shouldn't drink that much.
Hey let's go home, let's go
home.
Who's that?
Ah, my wife.
Victoire, nice to meet you.
Your wife?
Very nice to meet you.
Hey, please, please, please
calm down.
Hey, did you know your husband
Is fucking my girlfriend?
It's time to go.
What?
What the fuck are you saying?
Hey please, please...
(Everyone is talking over each
other)
(Glass shattering)
(Upbeat music)
You piece of shit!
You American cunt!
(Upbeat music)
(Moaning)
Thank you Electra.
I'm the victim in this
situation,
Me, not him.
He's walking out there
on the street right now
Laughing about this.
He's got a cut on his head
yet he's fucked up my life,
He's fucking up the life of his
wife,
Of his kids, of me and
my girlfriend and it's...
Calm down, look,
you're drunk, obviously...
I'm drunk, yeah, I'm drunk.
Okay, okay, but that
doesn't change the fact...
Calm down okay, not that tone.
What if he was fucking your
girlfriend?
I'm asking the questions here.
I'm trying to make you see my
point.
You don't solve things like
that, okay,
You beated him.
I'm proud of what I did.
You don't have regret?
I'm proud of what I did.
Fucking France, 1918 was the
last time
You guys won a war, since
then what have you done,
Nothing, you sit on your asses
eating...
Stop now, okay, stop.
I'm an American, I'm an
American.
And what now?
And we fight for what we
believe in.
And that guy, that guy
is nothing, he's a rat.
He's nothing.
He's less than nothing.
I liked that cop.
[Electra] That cop was a pig.
[Murphy] He understood me.
[Electra] Why was this
cop, who was asking me again,
All these questions about my
sexual life?
[Murphy] 'Cause I'm a man.
[Electra] You stupid child.
[Murphy] That's one thing
women don't understand.
Men understand each other.
We have respect for one another.
I was supposed to keep it a
secret but he took my number
Because he said he
wanted to buy me a drink.
[Electra] Then go with him.
[Murphy] Yup.
What I did was right.
I protected my woman.
[Electra] Don't touch me!
[Murphy] Hey, that's how you
repay me?
After everything I did for you?
I was taking care of you.
Just shut up.
I don't want to see you anymore.
[Murphy] Electra.
That cop agreed with me, you can
ask him.
Hello, hey, I don't treat you
like a bitch
Like that fucking gallery owner.
[Electra] It's over.
[Murphy] Cunt.
I'm not a slave to pussy.
Maybe I should call my little
friend.
Pussy is pussy.
I'm just really in my head right
now.
Okay.
It's not you, this
doesn't normally happen.
So?
Are you sad?
Your heart is broken?
No I'm just pissed off.
Why?
Why?
Yes.
I almost just broke
up with my girlfriend.
Oh...
That hurts.
(Mumbling), you know,
It's gonna happen a lot of time
In your life and you're going to
be
That sad all the time?
If you fall in love, really,
You are the loser.
You understand me?
I'm the loser?
Yes.
(Phone dialing)
[Voiceover] Hello?
[Murphy] Hey, hey.
[Voiceover] Yeah?
What do you want?
I'm sleeping.
[Murphy] Can we meet?
[Voiceover] I hate you.
[Murphy] Electra?
[Voiceover] (sighs) Okay,
let's meet.
[Murphy] Where are you?
(Electronic music)
[Electra] Wait.
(Electronic music)
(soft moaning)
That gets me off.
(Electronic music)
(moaning)
Maybe one day we can try...
Love At Eight Months:
A Pregnant Love Story.
Fist Made In Germany.
That's a propaganda film.
Some people are sick for real.
Hey...
These people are unafraid.
(Electronic music)
Yeah maybe I just want.
You can't have that.
(Upbeat music)
(soft moaning)
I don't want you to come
back to my police station,
To my office, because
you beated another guy
Who looked at your girlfriend.
[Murphy] No that's
not gonna happen again.
Yeah but for that you
need to free yourself
From that feeling, you
need to forget about that.
You know it's, forget about,
You are in France here, forget
about your American feeling
Of possession, of ownership, of
war,
Of violence.
Try to think differently, in
the United States in the 60s
You were different, people
were loving each other.
What's wrong about going in the
club,
Fucking other women, because you
know
You will fuck other women in
your life,
But you will fuck other women
in your life in her back.
Here you do it with her.
It develops your confidence,
your trust.
I'm sure you will like it,
there are gorgeous women,
Beautiful women, it's clean,
it's nice,
There is music, it's even
nicer than a normal club,
Don't think about it like filthy
club
Or something like that,
it's beautiful it's clean.
[Murphy] You go every week or
what?
Oh we go often, not
every week, often, yeah.
And I live my sexuality in a
good way,
I feel relaxed, calm, balanced,
I don't have the feeling you
have, I don't beat people,
And that's probably the
most beautiful thing
You can do with your girlfriend.
Just to know that she
has some other desire
And you offer her that desire.
Bring her, she will enjoy,
Perhaps she will enjoy watching
you
Fucking another woman.
As long as she knows
you come back with her.
We go often.
And we're cool, look we are
friends.
[Murphy] When's the best time
to go?
Ah Friday, Saturday.
The weekend.
The weekend you have plenty of
people,
So plenty of choice, you can
pick up the one you want,
Or you can watch, I love
watching.
(Deep electronic music)
(moaning)
(Heavy moaning)
(deep electronic music)
You loved it, you were in
heaven,
I look over and you're
jerking some French retard's
Cock off.
You were so sad there,
fucking all the girls.
Right in my face.
All the girls, you were
fucking another girl!
You wanted me to fuck her!
Oh so it's just something
what I wanted now?
No.
I don't even know why you let
me bring us to this fucking
Place to begin with.
You wanted to go there, and we
said
We would have to try everything
together.
Well I'm a fucking bonehead
okay,
So don't let me be so
stupid next time, please.
You fuck two girl at the same
time,
I want to fuck two guy at the
same time.
No.
If you want you can join us.
If I want I can join you.
Yeah.
You live in fear.
What about a tranny?
You wanna fuck a tranny?
It would be a good compromise.
Some boobs, some cocks.
You're fucking crazy.
What about you?
Hey baby.
Mommy has some
Warm milk
For you.
Look.
Look.
Come on.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
No I can't, I can't.
Feel it, you saw.
I thought I could, I can't, I
can't,
I'm sorry.
Feel it.
No I'm sorry I can't, no, no,
no.
No, no, no, I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't, I can't, I
can't.
I'm never gonna get another
boner.
I'm sorry...
[Prostitute] So, what is the
problem?
I'm sorry.
[Prostitute] What I'm
sorry, how come you're sorry?
Relax babe, there's no problem.
(Moaning)
I want you.
I want sex with you.
[Murphy] I think I had a
blackout.
[Electra] Don't worry.
Don't worry.
What doesn't kill you makes you
stronger.
[Murphy] I wish I could
erase that thing from my mind.
[Electra] Don't make such a
big drama.
[Murphy] Promise me
That you will never
tell anyone about this.
[Electra] There is nothing to
hide.
You can just say it to Julio.
[Murphy] Secrets make you
stronger.
[Electra] No.
Secrets make you darker.
You know what?
If we had to break up,
I would probably disappear.
[Murphy] How many guys have
you left?
This is not the point.
The guy I left, I wasn't in
love.
Let's try to protect each other.
I love you.
I love you too.
I'm not painting and
you're not doing your stuff.
We are taking so much drugs,
fighting.
Yeah and it's raining.
And it's cold.
And maybe we're not
The great artists that we
dreamed we were.
Maybe this is
All just shit.
Maybe I should sleep in
my place for a little while.
Yeah, maybe that's a good
idea.
I feel we are losing time
and...
I'm not always a good influence
for you
And you are not even a real good
Influence for me.
Yeah maybe we should take a
break.
You know sometimes I miss your
ponytail.
Sometimes I miss to laugh.
You were so joyful.
When we met.
When we first met?
At the park?
No I mean also later.
It seems like a long time ago.
And you weren't wearing these.
(Calming, melancholic music)
Hi.
Hey.
You having a good time?
Yeah, this is my favorite
park.
Cool.
But I have to go.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'll walk with you.
No I'm fine.
No really I'll walk with you,
It'll be more fun, it'll be
nice.
Anyway, you have to be careful,
Because Paris is a really
dangerous city
With all the foreigners around.
(Giggling)
Where do you come from?
America.
You?
I'm from everywhere.
Oh one sec, Julio!
What's up, where you going?
Oh uhm, I'll be right back,
I'll catch you later.
From everywhere?
I mean I'm, my blood is,
Is mixed.
Celine, I will call you, bye.
They are my schoolmates.
Yeah?
I'm going to art school.
Oh cool.
(Speaking French)
And what do you do in Paris?
I'm in film school.
Are you in love?
I have someone.
Well of course you do,
All the best girls have someone,
But they're not all happy.
(Giggling)
But you didn't say you
were in love with him.
I don't know anything about
love,
But in my mind it's like a place
You don't want to live.
Okay?
It would be something like
a...
Okay, so you've been in love,
You know what it feels like,
But you're no longer there, you
left?
Well I mean,
It happened that we
wound up in a situation
Where you feel a lot of love
around you.
Not only like in a relationship,
I mean love is,
No, love is life,
Love is life.
Hey, no that way!
This way?
[Electra] Yeah.
Sorry.
Sorry.
It makes people brag.
Yeah it makes people brag,
Also it drives people crazy.
A young person without love is
like,
Like a sparrow without air.
(Giggling)
Oh you didn't know you could
fly, did you?
That's what I want to do.
It's true, you think I'm
joking?
I'm serious, I'm fucking serious
like now.
Look we live one life.
When we're born, we know we're
gonna die.
And so what's the point,
To keep on fighting?
For what?
There's no hope, because,
We should just commit suicide.
I don't wanna say goodbye.
Hey.
What's the meaning of life?
Love.
(Calming, melancholic music)
What's your name?
Murphy, what's yours?
Electra.
(Calming, melancholic music)
(Soft moaning)
I wanna fuck you so much.
So much...
(Calming, melancholic music)
(moaning)
Will you promise me something?
No matter what,
We will protect each other,
From anyone,
That will ever stand between us.
I promise.
I promise too.
(Calming music)
Are you afraid of death?
I'm afraid of pain.
I don't wanna die in pain.
I'd rather
Commit suicide.
[Voiceover] Please, please,
please,
God,
Tell me she's okay.
I don't want anything
bad to happen to her.
Just tell me she's okay.
(Phone dialing)
Tell me she's happy.
[Voiceover] (speaking French).
[Voiceover] Tell me she's
alive.
[Voiceover] (speaking French).
[Voiceover] No, please, God.
Tell me this isn't true.
No, no, no...
I wanna go back.
I wanna go back to the first
night.
I wanna wake up with her.
Grant me this one wish.
Please let me do that.
And I swear I'll live a good
life.
I swear, I swear to you.
(Melancholic, calming music)
(Mumbling) a place that
(mumbling).
[Voiceover] I swear that this
is ours.
Life is what you make of it.
[Voiceover] I'll be good.
Like a dream.
[Voiceover] I'll be true.
I like you.
I like you too.
[Voiceover] Electra I love
you.
There's nothing after death,
Nothing,
Nothing at all.
(Melancholic, calming music)
Did you come inside me?
(Serene music)
When you die.
You die with your memories.
Murphy, I love you
So much.
If one day I die,
I would love to know,
That you fall in love
Again, and again,
And again.
(Serene music)
(Crying)
(Door opening)
[Gaspar] Dad?
Come here.
Huh?
[Murphy] Come to Daddy.
[Gaspar] Huh?
(Crying)
Gaspar, I'm so sorry.
Life is not easy.
Some day you will understand.
(Crying)
Please forgive me.
I am lost.
(Relaxing, melancholic music)
Please.
Don't you ever leave me.
[Murphy] I promise,
I will love you till the end.
(Melancholic piano music)
