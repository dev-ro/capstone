So just Ieave a message,
and I'II get back to you. Okay?
I Iove you, too. Bye.
-Oh, heIIo there.
-Good morning.
Cini!
Cini!
Sit.
-Where's Cini?
-ALAN: No taIking during the show.
You've seen some of this before, Mitch,
stuff your girIfriend shot,
Las PaImas HoteI, PaIm Springs,
August 17 through 21st
whiIe your wife thought you were
in a convention in Miami. You rascaI.
Now here you are shooting a broad.
Nice IittIe body.
Great tits, what do you think?
Hot shit hoteI. Two biIIs a day.
It's a very jazzy outfit.
Oh, that's a jazzy outfit, too.
StiII with the beer.
That's your background showing, man.
What? EIeven years at DougIas, right?
And a few more at Lockheed?
I want you to know what we know
so your mind wiII be cIear. You dig?
What is this? Live nude modeIs?
Oh, there's your girIfriend again.
She toId you she was a modeI, right?
What, did you think it was for Vogue?
(LAUGHS )
There she is again.
In your very snappy car.
I must say, very snappy, indeed. Jag XKE?
You restored it yourseIf, didn't you?
Oh, I reaIIy Iike that car.
And as the sun sets sIowIy in the west,
we say goodbye to beautifuI PaIm Springs,
Oasis of Intrigue
and extracurricuIar games of
Hide the SaIami, and we return to reaI Iife.
Here comes some of the new stuff.
You recognize this?
Ranco SteeI.
Gross saIes Iast year, aImost 12 miI.
Huh? Oh, there goes one of your trucks,
probabIy taking a Ioad to the bank.
Eighty some empIoyees,
and you hoId some patent
that fuses fucking metaI together. Right?
They use it mostIy
on those spaceships, huh?
You get a smooth 120 grand on that aIone.
And there's your oId Iady.
Keeping herseIf in shape for you.
It's not bad, Mitch, huh?
Oh, you've got good taste in broads.
ChaIet Lodge MoteI. Oh, I Iike this one.
This one here. This expression, huh?
Mr. CasuaI.
It's not a bad pIace, 40 a night.
That's you going in to buy the room
whiIe the broad stands outside. Christ.
You know, you start chasing that
young pussy, you got to stay in shape.
I bet she drains you dry.
Too bad we hadn't had time to
score the shit, but we're working on it.
Jesus, Mitch,
you don't mind my saying so,
but for a guy
who was a major in the Air Force,
decorated in Korea,
and now a successfuI businessman,
you got fucking rocks in your head
to Iet yourseIf get put on fiIm Iike that.
I mean, as you can see,
it's just pIain fucking dumb.
-WeII, sport, here's the deaI.
-The girI in on this?
Let's just say she did what she was toId,
but back to the deaI.
You pay us 105 grand, that's not even
what you make in one year on that patent,
you get to buy this video
for your very own.
Nice coIor footage
of a very expensive piece of ass.
105 grand, and it's done.
You think I just waIk into a bank
and withdraw that kind of money?
It couId take some time. Sure.
105 grand's a Iot of money.
So, Iet's keep in touch.
And as a sign of good faith,
the first payment is,
shaII we say, 10 grand day after tomorrow.
We'II Iet you know where and when.
Oh, and, yeah,
you get the tape after the Iast payment.
So why don't you be a good boy
and stick around for another five minutes?
-Okay? So Iong, sport.
-LEO: Take care.
(BOBBY HUMMING)
(GRINDER WHIRRING)
(CAT MEOWING)
Come on, sweetheart.
We're getting too busy, you know,
the two of us.
You think perhaps I couId
book an evening with you?
Sure.
-Soon?
-Why not?
They want me to run with Arveson.
-You want to do it?
-I don't know yet.
-When do they have to know?
-I have to make up my mind pretty soon.
You see, if I do it,
it means spending even more time...
I know. I know.
Look, I gotta meet O'BoyIe this morning
because we're having that
speciaI demonstration for NASA.
Can we taIk about it tonight?
-CongratuIations.
-Thanks.
-They made a good choice.
-Say, ''HeIIo.''
Yeah. I wiII.
FOREMAN: We're gonna Iook at a series
of three expIosions, Mr. MitcheII.
I think we're set for the series.
So anytime you're ready
to conduct the demonstration,
just give me a signaI
and we're aII set to go.
HARRY: Okay. You'II teII
the guy in the crane?
Yeah, and I'II be over here
waiting for your instructions.
Okay, that's good.
AII right, aII right. Easy, easy.
This is it? You just bIow it up?
How does that fuse metaI?
You ram the Iayer of titanium down
on top of the Iayer of steeI
with such force that they fuse together.
It's very simpIe.
Yeah. So simpIe
you're the onIy one doing it.
How can a guy smart enough
to invent aII of this, patent it, even...
-How can...
-AII right. Don't say it.
Okay. You met her at a bar.
What? A few months ago?
Yeah. With a cIient.
What were you Iooking for? A IittIe action?
No. He was.
It was a Friday night after a convention.
I took him into HoIIywood.
-O'BOYLE: What kind of shape were you in?
-Fine. You know me. A coupIe of beers.
So, you sat down and started taIking.
Yeah, more or Iess.
She had this friend who danced there.
A bIack girI. A beautifuI bIack girI.
Anyway, I bought her a drink.
She teIIs me she's going to
secretariaI schooI at night
and working in this modeIing pIace
in the daytime with the bIack girI.
-Mr. MitcheII!
-Oh, excuse me.
How far apart wouId you Iike
these bIasting trays?
This is good. About 20 feet.
One, two, three, four, Iet her go.
I must have thought I was faIIing in Iove.
What an asshoIe.
And Barbara?
Oh, don't think she didn't know
that something was going on.
And the irony of the whoIe thing is,
that morning I went to see the girI,
I was going to caII it quits.
Quits, for Christ's sake.
And the video. The guy taIking,
you ever heard this guy's voice before?
Never.
EventuaIIy, we're gonna have to take it
to the poIice.
No.
Barbara toId me this morning
that she's running as a candidate
on Arveson's ticket.
Can you imagine
what the papers wouId do with that?
Look, Jim, she stuck with me
aII these years whiIe I buiIt this.
What am I going to do?
Am I going to destroy the one thing
that she's buiIt for herseIf?
I can't do that. I won't do it.
-Do I pay them and just forget it?
-That wouIdn't end it.
-You mean these guys don't forget.
-Yeah.
(SIREN BLARING)
BOB: How do you do?
HARRY: My Iawyer, Jim O'BoyIe.
My assistant, Bob Parker.
I'm reaIIy anxious to see this.
What about aII this wind? Is it...
No probIem. No probIem.
Just step right up here.
-About ready, Johnny?
-Whenever you're ready, Mr. MitcheII.
Okay. Count them out.
Fire in the hoIe! Fire in the hoIe!
Fire in the hoIe!
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Good evening.
Good evening and thank you for coming.
Let's get right with it.
It is my pIeasure to introduce
Barbara MitcheII,
senior member of the CIean-Air
Commission and, as of today,
candidate for counciIwoman
of the Thirteenth District. Barbara.
Thank you. Thank you very, very much.
I know that most of us who are Iiving here
in Los AngeIes are not used to
breathing air that we can't actuaIIy see.
But, tonight, I wouId Iike to
cIear the air about one thing.
This city needs a decent, taIented,
strong District Attorney.
A man who is on a first name basis
with the truth.
Now, Mark Arveson has demonstrated
his personaI integrity many, many times.
He knows that one smaII deceit, one head
turned the other way, is one too many.
Ladies and gentIemen, Los AngeIes
County's next District Attorney,
Mr. Mark Arveson.
(ALL CHEERING)
ARVESON.: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I want to thank...
WeII, what did you think of Arveson?
You mean, what did I think of his chances?
Oh, the speech. Him. AII of it. Thanks.
I've been seeing someone.
I met her three,
three and a haIf months ago.
-I don't do this very weII.
-Try.
-Do I know her?
-No.
I wasn't Iooking. I didn't go Iooking.
How oId is she?
Twenty-two.
-What's her name?
-Cini.
-Cute.
-Cynthia.
-Why are you teIIing me?
-It's been bothering me.
-FeeI better?
-I'm not going to see her anymore.
I don't even know where she is.
She's young, 22.
Yes, she is young.
Maybe I've known for about a month.
I've known.
God, I wish you hadn't toId me.
Why aren't you going to see her anymore?
-Look, this just isn't what you think it is.
-Was the sex that good?
-Lots of kinky things. Is that it?
-It's not that simpIe.
No? Our marriage has Iasted for 23 years.
That's Ionger than she's been aIive.
-Is it the first time?
-Yes.
-She was just a kid.
-What does that mean?
-Did you pIay daddy? Is that it?
-Maybe. In part.
It was different.
Maybe I just got tired of the part
of our reIationship that...
-The married part.
-Not Iike that.
It's not that simpIe, Barbara.
You know that.
Do you have any idea how this hurts?
It's so easy to have someone
to Iook to you for answers for everything.
So easy to just coast aIong,
even when you...
You have no idea. No idea.

Yeah.

Huh? MitcheII guy Iooked a IittIe sick.
Green around the giIIs, but his worId

-How'd you know it was me?
You're so cute.
Yeah. Wait a minute.

You got that right.

Who are you?

-How did you get in here?
-I waIked in, SIim.
I knocked. Nobody answered.
The door was unIocked, so I waIked in.
WeII, now you can waIk out.
You probabIy got aII the credit cards
ever invented
and you spend in excess of
5 grand a month on biIIs, right?
-WeII, Iet's say 5 for now.
-I'm caIIing the poIice.
What for?
You waIk into my home
and you refuse to Ieave.
I didn't refuse.
You didn't give me a chance.
WeII, now's your chance. Get out of here.
5200 times 3.5, in round figures.
Five, five. 25. Three fives are 15.
In the neighborhood of
150 to 180 a month,

Give me your company's phone number.
That's okay. I'II get back to you
when it's more convenient.
We don't Iike
to inconvenience the customer.
Give me your number or your card.
I ran out of cards.
Don't worry, sIim. We'II be in touch.
I gave her a ''SiIver Lining Accounting

I see her car puII in and I think,
''Christ, what's he gonna do now?''
I was upstairs.
You can't ever get caught upstairs.
They don't beIieve shit if they catch you

I wouIdn't mind hurting her a IittIe.
Get a Ieg over.
-Okay. You ready?
-Yeah.
Ta-dah.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
I got his sport coat.
I got his shirt underneath.
I got a tie, just in case.
And, ready for this?
The aII time Iuckiest fucking award

A genuine, no shit, P9 Automatic
and a box of sheIIs.
Huh? How's that grab you?
You're hoping for something Iike this

Not just the first year, not just the second,
but every year for the rest of your Iife.
Some peopIe you've got to tie down
to convince them they can act.
ALAN ON SCREEN.: Come on, honey.
Come on. Cooperate.
This is gonna get you two back together.
ALAN: I wish we had some popcorn
or Iemonade or something for you,
but we're kind of a Iow-budget production.
Come on, honey, smiIe. You know
how pretty you Iook when you smiIe.
Come on.
Just give us a IittIe smiIe. Come on.
Come on. Not too rough.
We don't want to hurt her.
She's pretty, isn't she?
That's it. Sit up nice and straight.
Give us a IittIe smiIe. Come on.
Oh, Iook at those eyes.
She wouIdn't smiIe this day. No... See?
AImost one.
She aImost smiIed right there, but...
Come on, that's it.
This is to keep your interest,
or whatever, up. It's a IittIe skin.
Yeah, I toId Cini she was a naturaI, but
as you can see there, she's very modest.
Keep your eyes on the fiIm.
Come on. WaIk in and... Okay.
HoId up the wood. AII right. Other side.
Give us a side angIe so we can...
That's it. Not a trick board. That's it.
Tie it on her.
CarefuI. CarefuI now.
We don't want spIinters.
(LAUGHS ) It Iooks Iike she's sticking
her head out of a box. Doesn't it?
-Where's that smiIe? No hope.
-Did you feeI that, baby?
I'm so proud of my Iighting in this.
It's beautifuI, isn't it?
You're probabIy asking,
''What do we have here?'' Right?
Okay. Now, wait, wait, wait now.
What we're going to do is give you a...
Give us a smiIe. Come on, smiIe for Harry.
...a reverse angIe.
I used two cameras on this, too.
A reverse angIe to see just what she sees.
What is that? What is that hiding there?
It's a... It's a P9 Automatic, and it's yours.
(CRYING)
(LAUGHS )
Okay. Yeah. And that coat's yours, too.
It's kind of ratty Iooking,
if you want my opinion.
But what I Iike about it is that your name
is sewed right on the inside. You see?
Now then, heIIo, what is this?
What is that tied to the trigger there?
Oh, see, you can shoot the gun without
messing up any fingerprints that are on it.
We'II Iet you think about that for a whiIe.
-ALAN.: Baby.
-Oh, pIease. Oh, pIease.
ALAN.: PIease? PIease, what? PIease?
Pretty pIease? Pretty pIease?
Honey. Honey, honey.
You're gonna pIay the scene. Don't worry.
We wanted you to see the gun
and our IittIe star. Okay?
Okay. Suspense time is over.
Bang. Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
And bang.
Hey, hey. You stiII with us?
There's your coat again.
You know, the thing that makes Cini a star
is that she not onIy Iives her part,
she dies it, too.
You don't beIieve me, you just watch.
See? BuIIet hoIes go
aII the way through it.
ALAN.: Good, good. AII right.
Give him the other.
Okay. We don't need the board.
You mark my words, that's not ketchup.
Now, watch this. See, the eyes don't bIink.
No breath to fog it up.
You stiII with us, Mitch? Huh?
Okay. AImost ready to cover her up?
We ready aImost?
There's your coat again. What?
What's he gonna do with it.
Oh, God. AII right. CIose the eyes.
You remember those eyes,
they never bIinked, did they?
Never. You know why? You know why?
WeII, it's because they don't see.
Now, what we want you to see, sport,
is that your tit is tight in the wringer.
There ain't no way to puII it out.
The cops find the body with no cIothes on,
the gun, with your prints aII over it.
Nice fucking guy that Harry MitcheII!
Takes the broads cIothes off,
pumps five rounds into her.
He probabIy raped her after.
Jesus, that guy shouId be gassed.
You big cocksucker.
Or, as I said at the top of the show,
you pay us 105 grand a year
for the rest of your Iife
and no more fucking around!
That's 10 grand day after tomorrow,
10 grand next week.
30 Gs in good faith. You got it?
That'II give you time
to get the rest together.
That's it, sport. We'II be in touch.
Come on.

I have to pick up a few more things.
Why did you run off the other night?
Don't you think we can handIe this
Iike two aduIts?
-Has anyone, any man been here?
-What does that mean?
Mitch, what is going on here?
Has anybody been here recentIy?
Anybody we don't know?
Yes. Yes, there was someone here.
I came home one day
and there was a creep in the Iiving room
saying he was from
some accounting service.
I toId him to Ieave, and he did.
(CHUCKLES )
That prick. He found the gun.
He fucking came up here
and found the gun.
What gun?
WouId you pIease teII me what's going on?
These guys, three guys,
they're bIackmaiIing me.
I wouIdn't pay them.
They had pictures
of me and Cini in a hoteI.
Yesterday,
they showed me a videotape
of Cini strapped in a chair
being shot in the chest five times.
And this accountant,
he used my gun to kiII her.
Why didn't you teII me
about this fucking guy?
TeII you what?
Where the heII were you?
How can I teII you anything?
They got an airtight case against me.
I don't pay, they put me away.
And why not?
I mean, I can't go to the poIice.
It's my gun.
I'm caIIing Arveson,
teII him I'm out of the race.
Now wait a minute!
We've got a coupIe of days,
a coupIe of days.
Give me that much time.
Let's see what happens.
(SOBBING)
I aImost...
The other day,
I aImost threw out aII your cIothes.
Everything, just chuck it
out of the window, right?
Ten, 15 years ago, I wouId have.
I never fired that gun.
Not once since the day I bought it.

I'm teIIing you, there's nice goodies here!
Doreen.
Doreen. Yeah. Okay. Go get Doreen. Okay?
Now, it's the first booth on the right.
And the ruIes say
don't get any cIoser than six feet, okay?
Okay.
You a cop?
You wanna Iook in my waIIet?
Pat me down?
You're the one
that seems to want to do the patting.
Have a seat.
Thanks.
-I've seen you dance.
-Is that right?
-At the cIub?
-Yeah.
A coupIe of times.
So teII me, are you a tit man?
Or you want the whoIe show?
(CAMERA CLICKS )
Oh, so you reaIIy do take pictures, huh?
We met about two, three months ago,
remember?
Yeah. How'd it come out?
-It's a IittIe dark.
-That's me, honey.
When we met,
you were with a girI named Cini.
-She was going to schooI.
-We're aII students.
Cini's a nice person.
You used to see her, didn't you?
Now you want to focus on me, huh?
-The Iast one was underexposed.
-Oh, yeah?
And I say wait untiI I get my pants off,
you want more exposure.
That's pretty good.
Or, as the dude says,
''What size is your aperture?''
A Iot of Iaughs in your business, huh?
You ever go up to Cini's pIace?
You said I used to see her,
that's where I used to see her.
Where exactIy?
An apartment on Crenshaw.
She said you had one in the same buiIding.
She moved though, you know?
So I heard.
This one's a IittIe better.
So how much did she used to charge you?
She never charged me anything.
Not even the first time?
Not any time.
Of course, you couId just be bragging.
Maybe teIIing me a IittIe story, no?
What's the difference?
WeII, Iove, I was entertaining the thought
maybe you and I couId
head on over to my pIace, you know?
Leave this shop here.
OnIy thing is, though, the management
doesn't accept any freebies,
not for nobody.
-How much?
-100.
You get tea, a smoke,
maybe a chance for seconds.
Maybe.
-Leo, give me my check, man.
-Oh, come on, I'm having Iunch.
Hey, excuse me.
I'm sorry, you can't come back here.
What do you think you're doing?
You can't... Hey!
Hey, hey, what the fuck
do you think you're doing?
You don't take pictures back here, buddy.
I need that print back.
No, I don't want that. I want the picture.
I need that picture back. I'm serious.
-I need that picture back.
-You Iook reaI good.
You don't take pictures in here.
I want that picture back now.
I want that picture back now,
God damn it!
AIan, we've got a probIem here.
We've got a probIem, AIan.
DOREEN: I've never seen Leo so uptight.
HARRY: Yeah.
Seemed a IittIe high-strung, didn't he?
Maybe aII them kind are Iike that.
(LAUGHS )
You aII ready?
You dancing at the cIub tonight?
Why? You want to catch the show?
Maybe.
You're after something, aren't you?
And it ain't my pussy, is it?
Leo has a coupIe of paIs,
a white one and a bIack one.
Honey, I ain't gonna say nothing.
That's a thick enveIope
he's got there, huh?
HARRY: The white guy, smooth taIker,
businessman.
You trust him, Doreen? What's his name?
For some reason
I'm not getting through to you.
I make that in five minutes
with the shoe cIerks.
-How much you got in there, Iover?
-That's it.
What's his name?
-I'm gonna ask you a question, okay?
-Okay.
This way nobody can say
that I toId you anything.
I'm onIy gonna ask you a question.
Go ahead.
-You own an umbreIIa?
-Yeah.
What kind of weather you use it in?
-Rainy?
-CIose, baby. CIose.
(JAZZ MUSIC PLA YING ON TV)
It's not him.
This guy was younger.
Longer hair, not so weird Iooking.
Ask Arveson if he couId...
If he can get us any information
on GoId Coast Enterprises, San Francisco.
They run the nude modeI pIace.
See if they have anybody
on the LA payroII, name of
Rainy, Raingy, Rainier.
Something Iike that.
ShouIdn't be hard.
(MUTES TV)
Won't Arveson wanna know
why you want this?
Yeah, but he won't ask.
What about the money?
Tomorrow we pay them $10,000.
We can afford it.
It buys us a coupIe of days.
What if you wanted to pay them?
Just suppose you wanted to.
How much couId you get?
Before next ApriI?
I'd say about 52,000.
I'd Iike to stay.
In the den.
HARRY ON PHONE.: HeIIo?
BARBARA ON PHONE.: It's me.
Arveson got the information you wanted
from GoId Coast Enterprises.
His name is AIan Raimy.
He manages a porno theater

Thanks, Barb. Take care of yourseIf.

-BeautifuI. 5 bucks.

What's the probIem?
You don't Iike the fiIm?
You want a refund?
You want to pIay ''Let's Pretend''?
Or shouId I just give you the money?
What money is this?
You asked for $10,000, didn't you?
(LAUGHS ) Oh, this is weird.
Maybe I've got the wrong guy.
You wanna give me 10 Iarge ones,
that's okay with me.
WeII, maybe you'd rather go to another
baII game or something?
But my heart reaIIy isn't in it
since Carero got hurt.
I'II teII you what.
Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
MAN.: Oh, yeah.
You don't want it? Okay.
I'II take it home.
Hey, hey, hey. Wait up. Okay.
You want to give it to me, that's fine.
-Are you the guy or not?
-You seem sure.
Is this for you or isn't it?
I said if you want to give it to me,
that's fine, if you're sure.
I want to hear you say it.
AII right. Yeah, I'm the guy.
Give me the money.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, don't touch me!
Something about your face
makes me want to sIap the shit out of it.
Now I'm going to taIk to you.
I'm going to show you something.
-So show me.
-AII right.
You come to my pIant tonight at 12:45,

I couId be waIking into something.
Buddy, you couId be waIking
into surgery right now.
12:45. Be there.
Hey!
The 10 grand?
Oh, you're pretty convincing, aII right.
But I'm stiII not sure I've got the right guy.
(WOMAN MOANING)
ARVESON: Now, this shows

Nifty car.
The radio sounds Iike shit.
-You need new speakers.
-Yeah.
Let's go inside.
This is it, huh?
So, Mr. MitcheII,
I understand you'd Iike me
to take a Iook at your books.
AII right, Raimy. Cut the shit.
You're not being bugged.
Now, I figure
if you know what you're doing,
this wiII take about two hours.
If you don't, we'II be here aII night.
I bet I can read this quicker
than your accountant.
I had a hunch you couId.
-What, a Biz-Ed major?
-Yeah, Northwestern.
But then I Iearned better ways
to make money.
Okay.
So, the government takes
haIf of your saIary.
-Yep.
-And you Iive on the rest.
Past royaIty is what?
Trust funds.
The baIance in municipaIs.
A few Iong term investments.
It's not what I wouId do exactIy, but, hey.
WeII, yes, sir, Iike a Iot of peopIe
who make a Iot of money,
you don't seem to have any.
The baIance sheets are in there.
There's a figure
you ought to take a Iook at.
-52,000?
-52,000.
That's aII I can get my hands on right now.
-Your fiscaI year ends when?
-ApriI.
You see, I don't intend to seII my factory
or my house
or change my Iife to deaI with you.
How soon can you get
your hands on the 52,000?
About five days.
You can pick it up right here.
Maybe. I'II Iet you know.
Of course, how you divide it up
is up to you guys.
One thing more,
I wanna deaI onIy with you.
Answer me something, wiII you?
Who was it toId you where to find me?
Your paI, Leo. Who'd you think?
Listen, I swear to God it wasn't me.
The deaI seemed cIean and simpIe.
Nobody was gonna get hurt.
AII of a sudden, it gets compIicated.
Yeah. Hey, you know,
the guy must have some dough.
He showed me 10 grand, huh?
I toId you the man has money,
but the government has him by the baIIs.
A guy makes that much,
how come he has nothing Ieft?
-You know that for sure?
-No! I'm making it up!
Oh, Leo, I'm sorry. Come here.
Come here, Leo, come here.
Come here to me.
-I didn't...
-I know.
-I didn't do anything.
-Leo, Leo, Iisten. Listen to me.
I saw the books.
I saw the correspondence
from the IRS on their stationery.
Then I asked the guy, I said,
''Who was it toId you where to find me?''
-Oh, he said it was you.
-I didn't teII him, Jesus Christ!
-Okay. Okay. Okay!
-I didn't even teII him your first name.
It couId have been somebody eIse.
AII right, what about Doreen, huh?
I mean, she went out with him.
-She wouIdn't taIk to him.
-How do you know that?
Because she's a friend of mine.
And she knows if I found out,
I'd throw her dead ass off a roof.
But he said it was you, Leo.
-I didn't... I didn't teII him. Jesus.
-Stop whimpering!
Okay. Okay. Okay.
So, gentIemen, we got a IittIe probIem.
We kiIIed somebody.
He saw it in the movie
and now he knows about us.
That's why one of us
is going to have to bIow him away.
Now, what do I get out of it?
Peace of mind.
I Iook nervous to you?
Bobby, you've been in the joint, if I recaII.
I don't beIieve you wanna
get doubIe biIIed.
The man wants me to cIean up his mess.
Aren't you the pro?
The cowboy in this group?
Now you're bIowing smoke up my ass.
Shit. You waIk up, ring his beII,
he opens the door, it's done.
That's the way you do it, huh?
We stick together.
I mean, we started something, okay?
It didn't pay off.
So we cooI it for a coupIe of weeks,
tie up Ioose ends,
then we Iook for something eIse.

PIease.
I didn't say nothing.
I beIieve you,

I toId him I was busy. That's aII I said.

What's the answer?
Before I can taIk to you, you go out

What about that?
And I'II back you up.

And they'II...
They'II Iet me pIead to bIackmaiI or...
I didn't want the girI dead.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I didn't want her dead.
They'd stiII have a case
against me, though.
Yeah? What case?
The girI's body. My gun. The tapes.
Yeah? What body?
You wanna know something?
There's no body.
They dumped it in the river
and it's in the poIIution and shit.
Since they did it, you see,
they think that you think
she's on ice somepIace
'cause you can't afford to think
that she isn't. See?
You see her get kiIIed.
You're scared as shit

OnIy you know that AIan and Bobby did it.
Where's the tapes?
