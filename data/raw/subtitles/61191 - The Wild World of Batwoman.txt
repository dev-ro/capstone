Here's your wrist radio.
Wear it at all times.
If you want to talk,
push the button.
- Button?
- Not yet!
In a few minutes you'll be
in direct communication
with the Batwoman, herself.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, sure.
Concede.
Under article 21, paragraph 2,
we accept your allegiance
as a Bat Girl.
You will obey all rules
and obey all orders
handed through channels.
Now drink this.
- Do I have to?
- It's part of the ritual.
Hey, it's good. Doesn't
taste anything like I figured.
Now that you're
one of us, I can tell.
We're vampires all right, but
only in a synthetic sense.
Drinking the real stuff
went out with Count Dracula.
- So what's this?
- The real groove.
Honey, mint cherry
and strawberry yogurt.
WOW!
Hey mate, got a light?
Sure buddy.
Somewhere in here.
Don't move!
Just hand over your wallet
and you won't get hurt.
All right fellows
You want it...
You just have
to come and get it.
Batgifl 14, to Batwoman.
14 to Batwoman.
Witnessed a hold up
that turned to murder.
Two men, I have descriptions.
Police should be notified.
South Alley,
behind the Star club.
Hi Dee. Can I buy you a drink?
Okay. You can,.
You got a good constitution.
Snapped out of it real fast.
- Who are you?
- Never mind.
Just sit still and
behave yourself.
- Where are you taking me?
- On a boat ride.
You don't have to worry,
you won't get seasick.
We make the cruise all the time.
But this is the first time that
a Batgirl is going on one.
What do you mean, Batgirl?
You don't have to play as dumb.
We know you're one of the
dolls working for Batwoman.
Ha, why do you think we
put the snatch on you?
Where did you say
you were taking me?
What I said was,
for you to sit still.
You do that you'll
make it easy on yourself.
Sounds like she's kidnapped.
But her radio's on.
Call Batwoman. Central line.
Batwoman speaking, who is this?
Yes, I know.
I'm picking it up on R5, too.
She's executed good thinking.
You should alert all
girls in your proximity.
Hang up now and
stand by for instructions.
But you said that
we'd be taking a boat.
From the docks or where?
Look what I said was, we'd
So that's your gimmick.
A wrist radio.
Hey, that's not bad.
Not bad at all.
Hey, I bet Batwoman can
hear us talking right now.
Testing, 1, 2, 3...
Can you hear me Batwoman?
Ha-ha-ha... Aaah!
This is Batwoman speaking
to you, whoever you are.
I have a simple warning.
That you've taken on much more
than you'll be able to handle.
Transmission to all girls, 0077.
We will hold special
meeting of code 331
according to articles
in manual A.
Attendance by entire
membership highly essential.
Don't be late, any of you.
Batwoman, over and out.
Hello...
Just relax my dear.
Nobody is going to hurt you.
I'll see to that.
She's a wildcat.
I'd like to belt her one.
Come on, Bruno, lay off her.
She's a good kid.
- A real cutie pie.
- Of course she is.
I must apologize to you my dear
for the circumstances in
which you find yourself.
But certain things become
necessary at times.
And thisjust happens
to be one of them.
But you have my promise
that I will make your stay here
just as comfortable as possible.
No, back, back,
back Heathcliff, back.
He is just curious.
Perhaps you're somewhat
of a bit curious yourself,
about this place, hmm?
I think it's only
reasonable that
the little doll is given
our best courtesy.
With a proper introduction.
Little doll, I'm known as Tiger.
I'd... I'd like you
to meet Bruno.
And this here is Professor Neon.
- He's a scientist.
- A great scientist.
Yeah, yeah, Neon,
he's a great scientist.
I have protected one,
some of the greatest scientific
discovery's of the 20th century.
Of any century.
I have no doubt that the
name of G. Octavius Neon
will go down in history as
one of the absolute giants
of civilized science.
Do you like monsters? Do you?
No, back, back, back Heathcliff.
Back I say. Now.
Yes, Rat Fink?
I see you were able to get the
girl without consequences
or undo complications.
- Yes, Rat Fink.
- Very good.
Your work has been commendable.
You will be rewarded
in the future.
Now listen carefully,
I want you to bring me
the girls wrist radio.
Bring it to my laboratory
within the next hour.
I intend to communicate directly
with Batwoman on
her own frequency.
I'll have a pipeline into every
conversation she carries.
It will be a pleasure
to pay her back
for all the times she's
foiled me in the past.
You have your instructions Neon.
- Carry them out.
-Yes, Rat Fink.
All right girls,
fitness concluded.
The meeting will
come to order now.
Let's hurry up.
You may take your position 14.
Thank you Batwoman.
1, 2, 3...
We the girls who are
dedicated to Batwoman,
take our oath
with all sincerity.
We the girls who are
dedicated to Batwoman,
take our pride
with all sincerity.
We the girls who are
dedicated to Batwoman,
fight against evil
with all sincerity.
At ease girls. Let's hurry up.
In view of the fact that
this is a special meeting
and the time element
must work in our favor
I think it advisable that
we dispense with roll call
and all formalities
under pack 440615.
Second the motion. All in favor?
All.
Motion carried Batwoman,
continue with business.
Thank you. To begin
with, I want to say,
That I feel intuitively
that the rescue plan
we work out will
ultimately succeed.
But at the same time will offer
hazardous conditions for you all
I feel strongly that if...
- Attention!
- She's got her radio back.
No, my young friend.
I'm happy to inform you
the girl did not
get back her radio.
She won't until I'm
ready to return it.
Are you surprised, Batwoman?
Do you know whose voice
you're listening to?
I'm afraid I do, and the
surprise is not a pleasant one.
Oh, I might have known
you were behind this.
What have you
done with that girl.
I've done nothing what so ever
except to extend some very
comfortable accommodations.
She'll be returned to you
quite safely Batwoman.
And what is the
price you're asking?
You know me better than that!
I simply need your help,
to enter a certain building
and secure a certain item.
I'm of course aware that
thievery is not in your line
And I'm sure that
you can understand
that the operation
is a delicate one.
If I had someone skillful
enough to carry it out
for me, I wouldn't have
put myself to all this bother.
I'm also certain
that is not necessary to
discuss the consequences
should you refuse to oblige me.
Obliging you is bitter enough
consequence in itself.
But I'll not take the risk of
that girl losing her freedom
because of me.
You win Rat Fink, but I
insist upon seeing her first.
Your distrust of me is
grossly unjustified Batwoman.
However,
I'll agree to your terms.
Twelve o'clock at the
top of Hang Mans Bluff.
My men will meet you there.
(Batgirl crying)
Give her another
happy pill will you.
I can't stand it.
(Batgirl still crying)
Just one of my many
spectacular feats.
I could make you so happy.
You wouldn't
believe it possible.
Here, why don't we all sit down
and make ourselves comfortable.
I've got some chocolate
milk in the refrigerator
and some macaroons.
Go ahead, sit down.
(Growling)
How long am I to
be kept waiting?
Oh, not for long, I'm sure.
At any moment I expect that...
Ha-ha. There you are you see.
No sooner said than done.
Oh, you can go and
turn on the switch.
Well, my adversary,
so we meet again.
Welcome to my humble facilities.
So we meet again, but for
the first time on your terms.
I can't recall ever being
placed in a position
where I would perpetuate
your evil plans.
I've always told you, Batwoman,
there are great things
we could do together.
Things that could
bring unheard of
power and riches to both of us.
You know how I feel about you.
I'm only here because
I have to be
and it won't be for
much longer at that.
Get on with your dirty business.
Very well, Batwoman.
As I've mentioned previously,
I want you to get
something for me
that I've wanted personally
for a long time.
The Ayjax Corporation has
developed an atomic hearing aid.
One that with
certain modifications
could pick any telephone
conversation desired.
Since it has this potential
the government has
refused the patent.
And ordered the one model they
have destroyed within 30 days.
I'm certain an assignment
such as this
will be entirely
within the realm
of your own many
splendored talents.
So you wish to
eavesdrop on every...
Neon, you idiotic fool,
what do you think you're doing?
You must have switched
the glasses Batwoman.
I I only wanted to show
you how wonderful they are.
I only wanted to make you happy.
Oh, oh, oh...
That's where you
made your mistake.
Flanagan, we're in trouble.
Deep, deep, trouble.
Oh, take it easy J.B. we don't
have to throw in the sponge
just because we're
hanging on the ropes.
- Well?
- That's an understatement.
I'd say it's more
like being pulled
to the corner after a nine cone.
We're not dead yet.
Now look, I have the legal
department working overtime.
They've got plenty of time to
come up with something J.B.
Look Flanagan...
There's been some speculation
in my mind about talking to you.
Oh, really!
Well, I'm afraid there exists
a few aspects to this
business of our patent,
being denied, that...
well, that I haven't
brought out fully before.
A few weeks ago, I was
contacted by a foreign agent.
A foreign agent?
You didn't make a
deal with him, did you?
Well, of course I didn't.
But through stories
carried by his cronies,
I'm sure a few people
assumed that I did.
Oh, look Flanagan...
I realize you've
got our legal boys
trying to concoct some
sort of appeal for us.
But the terrible thing is...
Well, I never told
you this either...
Our time limit for destroying
that device has run out.
We had just 15 days,
not 30 as I told everyone.
J.B., you kept that
thing here illegally.
Hoping we wouldn't
have to destroy it!
Well get ready for
the worst part of all...
I received a telephone call
early this morning
from Batwoman.
She was good enough to
inform me to be on the alert.
Extensive planning was being
executed for an attempted theft.
Does she know that to be a fact?
If she didn't,
she wouldn't have called.
Well...
Now that you've inform ed
me of our legal position
I suppose asking
the police for help
is highly questionable, J.B.
Why didn't you tell
me about this sooner?
What do you think I'm here for?
I was afraid.
And I was hoping for some kind
of appeal to the patent office.
Well, we just got to
think of something
to tighten it up, that's all.
Wait a minute...
Wait a minute J.B.,
I think I've got it!
Batwoman! With her we
might see some light yet!
Batwoman...
About that door, that's a
little dangerous, isn't it?
Well it wouldn't have operated
if you had no appointment
or someone was following you.
You were monitored
electronically
from the time you left your car
Oh really!
Oh, you mean like a
closed circuit television.
Something like that.
Would you like
some refreshments?
Er, no, no, thank you. I'm fine.
Very nice of you to see
me this way, Batwoman.
And I want you to know
that J.B. and the rest of us
will be forever grateful if...
well if... if you can just
figure out some way to help us.
I have no admiration
whatsoever for someone
who would listen in to
someone else's conversation.
Oh, Batwoman, you really don't
think that J.B. and I would...
Well, I'm not interested in
anyone else's conversation.
No, no, you have the
wrong idea, entirely wrong.
As a matter of fact,
the atomic power structure was
much more revolutionary than
anything we had counted on.
They want us to destroy it.
You see if you mix
a little cobalt with it...
Boom! And it goes.
It really goes.
But the main thing is,
if we can just hang on to it
until our appeal is okayed,
all of this can be worked out.
And then with, well...
with a little bit
more development
we can make a great
contribution to society.
But the big problem is Batwoman,
if it's stolen we're sunk.
If our device is
misused Batwoman,
there's no telling what
can be accomplished.
And do you realize
there will be no privacy.
And just consider the danger
if they find out about
the cobalt mixture.
Well I can see
it's a supposition
that should be
avoided at any cost.
Oh good, you'll do it.
You'll come in with us.
Give me some time
to talk with my girls.
- I'll call you within the hour.
- Fine, fine.
Come up right, close.
Come on...
Right, here.
That's a good boy.
I have something for you.
Ha-ha. Now, open your mouth.
Now Heathcliff, this is
not going to hurt you.
I just perfected a new formula
and I must test its reaction.
Whatever it does, it will
only last for a short time.
Now, come on.
Open your mouth.
Oh, Heathcliff, I'm losing
my patience with you.
I'll tell...
I'll tell you what...
If you take this pill,
then later on when I go to bed,
on the ground cave,
I'll take you with me.
And you'll be able
to see the monsters.
You can watch them all the time
that I am in the big cavern.
Now, wouldn't you like that.
Hmm? Huh... huh?
Oh, Heathcliff. Hmm!
Mmm-mmm.
Neon, I want to let you know,
that I'm completely disgusted
with the work of all
of you over there.
Letting Batwoman
escape with the girl,
it's all but ruined
my last chance.
We're left now with very little
time to form a new plan.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Everything seems to
be going wrong now.
How's everything at the cave?
How are all my monsters?
Never mind about the monsters,
keep your thinking on
what has to be done.
It's going to be more
difficult than ever now
because I have learned
through the grapevine,
that Batwoman, herself,
is guarding the vault at Ayjax.
They're take no
chances of our formulating
a successful operation.
But we'll do it anyway.
Success will be ours.
- Do you understand me, Neon?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Hello.
- (inaudible)
Good evening,
No. No one is here.
Everything is in order.
Right. Bye.
Well, I never would
have believed it!
This is wonderful!
Yes, this is wonderful.
If you will notice,
I have a double guard
consisting of my best girls
at the vault itself.
I hope you'll be able to relax
now that you're aware of
the extent of our precautions.
Oh, yes, yes, of course I will.
Uh, you've made me feel
completely secure, Batwoman.
And besides all that,
I have the only
key to the vault.
Right here in my pocket.
Uh, maybe you could do
with a little bit of lunch?
We can get it right downstairs.
Soup. Hot soup girls.
Here it is. Soup.
Get your soup girls.
Isn't that delicious?
Pass the soup.
Atta a girl. How's that taste?
Miss Benson,
I'm going to the commissary
for a quick bite of lunch.
Ring through to me if that
Simpson call comes in.
Miss Benson, did you hear me?
Miss Benson!
(Music/Dancing)
Yes, I understand there's
very good security here.
Yes, I approve of you Batwoman.
But we have many,
many things to talk about.
Yes.
No, no, we didn't order soup.
Um, we ordered a sandwich.
A sandwich!
Oh, well I guess this is
the special of the day.
Uh, it's good enough
for a starter.
Well! Ha-ha. That's...
Look at that!
Ha-ha. Batwoman. Ha-ha.
You like it, huh?
- Ha-ha-ha...
- Give me the key.
- Yeah!
- The key.
- The key to the vault.
- Oh, yeah!
- In the pocket, huh?
- Yeah! Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
- Flanagan!
- Yeah.
- Have you lost your mind!
- No!
- Ha-ha.
- Flanagan!
Come on.
Tiger, come on!
How's your throat?
- Well it's actually very...
- Sounds much better.
Mm, mm, mm.
Mm, mm, mm.
Hello, is this
Ayjax Development Corporation?
This is Seltzer,
the patent office.
I'd like to speak to
J.B. Christians, please.
He's where?
The home of Batwoman.
What's happened
that's so terrible?
Well yes,
I can get over there
Well, shouldn't I call first?
I see.
All right we'll take a cab
and get there right away.
Uh What's her address?
Mm, mm.
We must concentrate
ourselves fully.
And thusly penetrate into the
realms of empiric existence.
We must call upon an empiric
guide who will contact those
at this table within
the next few moments.
May we hear a voice.
A sign that this message
is being received
by those beyond
the physical plane.
We call out to the
world of spirits.
Will someone please come thru?
I...
am...
trying...
Do... you... hear... me?
Yes, we hear you plainly.
I wish to thank you
for coming to us.
It... is... perfectly...
all right.
What can I do for you?
It is desired by
those at this table
to locate a missing device.
One of an electronic nature.
It was stolen from
Mr. Christians here
only a few hours ago.
I emphasize the importance
of locating it immediately,
as it could be highly dangerous.
The individuals who harbor
it may not be aware
of its explosive potential.
(Chinese spirit
talking in Chinese)
I'm afraid I'll have to ask
you to repeat the message.
It sounded like Chinese.
I... am... sorry...
Please... give...
more... information...
The device was stolen from the
Ayjax Development Company.
I'm aware of the
thieves identity.
But not his whereabouts.
He has a hidden laboratory
somewhere along the coast.
I was there a short time ago.
But it was in the
middle of the night
and I was unable to take
note of any land markings.
The location of this laboratory
is what we ask you
to help us with.
I must emphasize again
that it's most important.
(Chinese spirit
talking in Chinese)
You're speaking
in Chinese again.
I have to inform you that
no one here is familiar
with Oriental languages.
Speak to us only in English.
Do you understand?
It is not I that speaks...
another tongue.
This would be another entity.
(Chinese spirit
talking in Chinese)
Would you please
leave the channel free
so I can communicate
with the other gentleman.
I'm sure you're
trying to assist us,
however I can't comprehend
a word you're saying.
(Chinese spirit
talking in Chinese)
Thank you very much.
Now may we get on
with the information?
We have a clear channel now.
You can speak to us.
It seems we've
lost communication.
Look, it's getting late...
Do you think we might
do this some other time?
Oh, don't misunderstand me,
Batwoman.
I do have confidence.
Well anything you
say, Mr. Christians.
You know your schedule
better than I do.
- Mr. Seltzer!
- What is all this nonsense?
And what's happened
to that hearing aid?
Did I hear correctly
about it being stolen?
Well... Uh... Uh...
Mr. Seltzer, I'd like you
to meet Batwoman.
- She's our hostess here.
- I'm aware of that.
How do you do, Batwoman?
This is Bookley, my assistant.
He can't speak, laryngitis.
Oh, like our guest
at the table. Ha-ha.
May I get you something
warm from the bar?
It might loosen up the throat.
It would seem to me that
things are loose enough
around here as they are.
- Does that stuff really work?
- Haven't you ever tried it?
Me? Nah. The nearest
thing I ever got to exercise
was a couple of strolls
everyday when I was up at state.
You went to State University?
University? Do I look like
I went to some University?
State Penn.
You should have
given college a try.
I went for a year and a half.
Is that where you
learned to dance?
You're the best dancer
I ever seen.
- Thanks.
- Gee, I'm sorry about that.
- Sure your are.
- I am, really.
I guess I shouldn't have
put the grab on you again.
But I'm being commended
for it by Rat Fink, himself.
He's coming up
here from the cave
to shake my hand personally.
Just as soon as Neon
finishes that hearing aid.
Well, there's nothing
here that shows
any chance of stopping
an explosion.
Well, look at this,
two separate protective stages.
Protection against what?
If a little cobalt got in it,
you couldn't hold it back.
Well, I know that's true,
but uh...
Well look Christians,
I can't stand here all day
and argue about this thing.
Now if you're going to give me
a lift to the hotel, well do so.
- Otherwise, I'm calling a cab.
- But, Mr. Seltzer!
Oh very well,
I'll drive you to the hotel.
Perhaps I can convince
you along the way.
I doubt it.
Calling all girls in the
north and middle sectors.
The beach you're searching
is the least likely to
be the threat one,
because that laboratory
uses high voltage
and there isn't any
on the north beach.
It was very dark
the night I left there.
But I did see a small leaf
in the water just offshore.
Keep your eyes open
for a hidden cove
that would be completely
covered at high tide.
Batwoman, out.
Batwoman, speaking.
This is Flanagan, Batwoman.
I just called to
tell you goodbye
and to thank you for
everything you did for the
Ayjax Development Company.
I... I appreciate that.
And also the fact that while
I was able to dance with you,
and I want you to know
that I really enjoyed that.
Oh, I'm not a drinking man,
Batwoman, but
Well I figured I'd
have a couple in...
in... in view of the fact
I'm leaving immediately
and I'm starting a new life
in the Fiji Islands.
I'd suggest you pull
yourself together Flanagan.
There's no need for
you to run off anywhere.
As far as my
position is concerned,
I can see my work is cut out
for me and I accept it gladly.
My gills, all of them,
are dedicated to
finding your device.
Right now they're out searching,
working with
selfless dedication.
Okay, fun times over.
Let's stand at attention.
Stand at attention.
You can get these guys phone
number when we have more time.
Right now,
we've got a job to do.
Spread out in singles.
Come on, let's move.
A little bit more with the hips.
No, no, to the side.
How's this?
Oh Tiger, you're just
not getting the feel of it.
But if I had some music...
In my apartment. Tiger why
don't you let me out of here.
- You can do it. Please.
- Hey!
I think you're running down.
I think you need another pill.
I don't want another pill.
I'm tired of being happy.
I've just come up from the cave
and Rat Fink want you to
finish your work down there.
Now Batwoman and her girls
were all over the beach.
And he said for us to put
Operation Plan Grab
X12 right away.
Batwoman, monitoring 223.
I'm passing the reef south
of the point. Batwoman over.
Batwoman, monitoring 223.
Come in 14
14 over and out.
Careful, you've got to watch
your footing down here.
I'd slow up for you but
we got to catch up
with the rest of them
otherwise they'll think
something's wrong.
So!
So, it might mean
I'll lose my job.
Big deal!
Everybody's got to have a job.
Sure, everybody's
got to have a job.
So go ahead and do it.
I wouldn't ask you
to make any sacrifice.
Oh, come on
little doll, be nice.
I know it's my fault I got
you messed up in this place.
But you'd have wound
up here anyway.
And I got to do what
they tell me to do.
Sure!
Come on, we're just about
near the big cavern.
It's really something.
You ain't never
seen nothing like it.
And wait till you
see the monsters
outside the Rat Pink's lab.
- I can't wait.
- Just a tiny bit further.
Come on, you're going
to see something.
Tiger, what's that over there?
- Where?
- Aaah!
Ah, they can't hurt you.
They ain't even alive. Come on.
WOW!
Didn't I tell you.
This place is something else.
It used to be a city,
thousands of years ago.
Pretty weird, huh?
Oh, Tiger, I'm scared.
It looks like they're
stopping to rest.
Rat Fink only usually
leaves me a face
when he's going to
see his monsters.
(Monsters growling)
Hey!
You're going the wrong way.
My my my monsters.
I want to see my monsters.
We don't have time. The orders
are to go right to the lab.
But I must see them first.
Just a quick teensy look.
He may be mistreating them
again or he may be hurting them.
Don't worry, he don't have
time for that right now.
He's got more important things
on his mind. Come on.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
This nectar, my dear girls,
is the most potent tranquilizing
agent ever devised
in a laboratory.
It gives me strength.
It enables me to
far great mysteries
that mortal man has never
dreamed of before.
Ha-ha-ha...
I'd ask you to join me...
But then you'll
have your opportunity
sooner than you realize.
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
You ain't boss with
a tranquilizer habit.
You ain't nothing if you can't
slow it out of them, fatso.
Now you hear this,
I'll have none of your insults.
You're in no position,
any of you,
to show off your bad manners.
Manners, he says!
All right, Neon.
I'll throw the bar current.
Where's the other girl?
Isn't she with you?
Tiger is locking up the place.
He'll bring her right along.
Oh, good. Ha-ha-ha...
We have room for just 1 more.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Well, Neon, what do you
think of our little menagerie?
Oh, it's marvelous.
Simply marvelous.
What is it Heathcliff? What?
Oh, do you want to think?
All right, but don't
touch any commotion.
Now, walk slowly now.
I think you have a
perfectly beautiful...
beautiful collection.
If I may say so, this time
you have outdone yourself.
Yes. Yes.
What I want to ask you...
What I want to
ask you, Rat Fink...
Yes, Neon!
Well, it's been several
days now and...
I... I just want to
look in on them
to see if everything is nice.
Then, I will come right back.
- I promise you...
- Never mind the monsters, Neon.
I just looked in on them myself.
But you never let me
see them anymore.
You are always putting me off.
They are my monsters Rat Fink.
I created them with these hands.
- With this mind...
- Are you saying, Neon,
that my own creations are
something less than yours?
Oh, my... my...
No, of course not.
I think... We both know what
the value of your great
work will bring to the world.
Why, it will bring um...
- Well...
- You'll be quite pleased
to know Neon that
all of your monsters
will soon be multiplied.
- Multiplied?
- Ha-ha-ha.
Why do you think I
have these girls here?
For them to meet partners
would be difficult to find.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
The offspring should
be most interesting.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
Wait! Wait! Those girls...
My monsters!
Oh! (Mumbles)
Okay, Tiger.
I'll pull the switch.
Oh!
- Yes, it's me.
- (Mumbles)
I bet you're wondering
how I found you?
- Yes.
- You should know me
better than that.
A cave of all places.
It was so elementary Rat Fink.
I don't know how you
could have taken the bait.
I knew you would kidnap my girls
and that's what I counted on.
Hmm, that's a homing device.
Each one of the girls
carries an oscillator set
for my own frequency.
And this not only picks
them up, but also frees them.
Free the others! Use your
magnetic electron device.
But Tiger, how did you
let her creep up on you?
Well, I didn't have
to creep up on him.
He realized of his own making
that he would do the honorable
thing and set that girl free.
This boy has fallen in love.
(Everyone congratulating Tiger)
Nice!
Rat Fink, may I
introduce myself?
My name is Flanagan.
Jim Flanagan.
I am Vice President of the
Ayjax Development Corporation.
Now I think if we all sit down
and have a little pow-wow,
that we can iron this out
and put out a new way.
Uh, Mr. Rat Fink, I understand
you have our hearing aid.
- Now I think that...
- I have a very good idea,
to sit down and talk things
over around the table.
I can whip up something
for all to drink.
I think there is
plenty for all of us.
And I have something else,
- real nice.
- Yeah.
Forget it Professor.
I've had enough of
those pills of yours.
I have no desire to
be made, happy.
But how would you like
to try a depression pill?
Well, Professor,
now that you mention it,
- maybe just a little...
- Now listen to me!
I've heard enough of
this dribble from all of you.
You're forgetting where you are.
This is a sanctuary of science.
- A place of discovery.
- Was a place of discovery.
You'll carry out the
work of evil no longer.
And I'll find the satisfaction
I've waited for, much too long.
Your true identity!
- Remove that mask, Rat Fink!
- Mask! No!
I fear your weapon Batwoman.
But I have no wish
to be destroyed.
Such an emergency
calls for the revelation
of the greatest discovery
of my career.
My fabulous body divider,
who made the things most
difficult for you, I'm certain.
- Stand where you are!
-All right, I will.
Ha-ha-ha! I did it to
replace me Batwoman.
I'm still over there and at
the same time I'm here.
And look, I'm there!
And there too!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
Grab him! Them!
All of them!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
And you'll never catch me!
I'll keep on dividing myself
until you lose count.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
Batwoman, can you do something?
Somebody's going to get killed.
My circuit reads, allow
capacity of 2.4 of microtherm.
If the cathode vibes shrunk the
electrons would cease to flow.
Yeah but, can you
stop his equipment?
Well, if he has power in it,
only several thousand volts...
See, look what I have.
This should do it.
Now turn this slowly.
Very slowly.
I can say one thing for you.
You have a tremendous
generating plant here.
It's been used properly
now for the first time.
Your little game has
finally come to an end.
You'll not win out
over me, Batwoman.
I'll see that we
all go sky high.
You know what's in this bottle?
It's cobalt 40.
A few drops of this
on the hearing aid
and the atoms
will begin to split.
Batwoman, he knows
about the mixture.
I'll do it Batwoman!
I'll do it if you force my hand.
Now wait a minute, Rat Fink,
what about the rest of us?
I don't want to die
because of you.
You're a fink, Rat Fink.
Ha-ha!
And that's it, Rat Fink.
Remove his mask!
J.B.!
Yes, Flanagan.
- It's me.
- But...
You mean all these years you've
been leading a double life?
You went to all this trouble
to steal your own invention?
I had to do it.
The patent office
kept all the blueprints.
I couldn't have
made another model.
I insisted on personally
watching it being destroyed.
I couldn't allow that.
I just have...
one little weakness.
Weakness? What weakness?
Well... We all have
our little throwbacks.
Little idiosyncrasies.
My weakness is...
I know this sound trifling
but I can't help myself.
I like to listen in on
telephone conversations.
The hearing aid was
designed for that purpose.
I realized that only by
having it stolen from myself
could I hope to
have it preserved.
It won't be preserved for
long and neither will we!
- He spilt the cobalt!
- It's too late!
It's seeping thru
the outer covers.
What do you mean too late?
Neon!
Batwoman, we got to
find a way out of here!
Quick Juan!
We must be near the ocean.
Directly to the surface.
It's a long way out.
In a few minutes it will be the
only way out. Everyone, move!
Professor Neon!
Neon, what happened?
I I can't remember a thing.
Heathcliff! Heathcliff, you...
you've gotten your voice back!
Yes, yes, of course, my voice
Voice... I...
Yes... yes...
I remember now.
It's coming back to me, but...
but it's been a long time.
- Yeah, 14 years.
- 14 years!
- Yeah.
- I rem ember.
We... we were working
on an experiment.
One that would bring out the
personality traits of an animal.
But Professor Neon!
What went wrong?
I... I... just used
some old formula.
You gave me some of the formula?
Me your friend! Your benefactor!
The one who was
financing your work?
Well, I didn't realize the
effects would last for so long.
But I've taken care
of you, Heathcliff.
All of these years,
I've taken care of you.
Well I'm grateful for that.
But we'll have to
discuss this, Neon.
We'll have to discuss
this quite thoroughly.
Now come along,
let's get away from this place.
Oh, I...
I can't straighten up. Oh!
You can't straighten your back?
Well don't fret Professor,
just give me your hand.
We the girls who are
dedicated to Batwoman,
take our oath
with all sincerity.
We the girls who are
dedicated to Batwoman,
take our pride
with all sincerity.
We the girls who are
dedicated to Batwoman,
fight against evil
with all sincerity.
At ease.
NOW!
You're one of us now, Tiger,
so you got to do it right.
How are you coming along?
Can I get you some more ice?
No, no, everything's quite
satisfactory, thank you. Ha-ha.
You know those kind of gyrations
were unheard of
in my college days.
In fact, if I had made
movements like that,
I'd been firmly boxed
in the ears.
Which reminds me...
I figured out what went wrong
with Neon's experiments
several years ago.
It seems to take consideration,
as a child, I fell on my head.
Which accounted for my turning
into an electrical genius.
The explosion of course, brought
upon the very same results.
You know, it's simply amazing
what can be accomplished
by simple blow to the head.
Just like the... Hold still.
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh!
