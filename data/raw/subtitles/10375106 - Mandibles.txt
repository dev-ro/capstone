Manu!
Manu!
Yeah.
Open up!
Just a sec.
You're in the water!
Oh yeah. I rolled in my sleep.
Yeah, whatever. Come on!
Got 5 minutes? It's important.
Okay.
But just... what's in the suitcase?
Not your problem.
Forget it, don't go there.
All you do is take the suitcase
from Michel-Michel,
stick it in the trunk of your car,
and make sure you close it. Okay?
Then you drive calmly,
drop it off with the other guy,
and that's it.
Okay.
You say okay
but you don't seem to get it.
Are you up for it or not?
Yeah, yeah, totally.
But why do we need a car?
I can carry the suitcase.
No way, you can't do that!
It has to be in a car trunk.
No one can see...
No one can see the suitcase.
Get it or are you dumb?
Get it, got it.
Once there, the guy who collects it
will give you 500.
500?
Yeah, 500.
All for you, no com for me.
500, just for you, because I like you.
Thanks! Geez...
You're helping me out. Here.
It's the address.
Michel-Michel's address.
You're expected at noon.
Can I trust you?
Yeah!
Here. Before you go,
buy a toothbrush and soap.
You look like a bum.
- Sorry, it's...
- I don't care. Bye.
Bye.
What the fuck...
Fill her up, sir?
Uh, dunno.
No way!
- Toro!
- Toro!
What an idiot!
See the car?
Yeah, real junkheap.
Where d'you get it?
I just got it, since today.
I dunno, wanna wash it?
I can't, I'm onto something.
Yeah?
Wanna help?
Don't say a word to Michel-Michel.
Let me do the talking.
- Why?
- He doesn't know you.
You say hi,
then let me talk. It'll be easier.
We get the suitcase, do the mission
and pocket the money. Period.
Nothing more to it.
Okay, I'm in.
But what's in the suitcase?
Drop it, it's not our problem.
Forget it. We're just transporting...
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
Strange, isn't it?
Dunno, it's an old car, right?
Yeah.
So I say nothing to Michel-Michel?
Nothing. I do the talking.
And don't ask what's in the suitcase
or whatever.
Say nothing. It's their suitcase.
We're just transferring it
to another guy.
- We never know what's inside?
- Who cares?
We're just transporters.
Here.
- It's an advance.
- Cool.
You'll get more later.
When the mission...
What the fuck is that?
Is Michel-Michel far?
Nah, about 15 miles.
And what if the car breaks down?
Don't worry.
It's German.
- Fuck!
- What the hell is that?
- It stopped.
- Wait, hush.
- It's only when we're driving.
- Hush!
- You a mechanic?
- No!
There.
Fuck!
It's the trunk.
What the hell is it?
Pretty scary, isn't it?
There it goes again.
Maybe it's a hairdryer?
No fucking way!
Should I open it?
Dunno.
Nah?
Go on, open it.
- You sure?
- Dunno.
- Sure or not? I'll do it!
- No idea.
What is it?
- Is it a fly?
- No way.
- Yeah, it is a fly.
- No.
- It's a fucking fly, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Looks stuck.
- Yeah.
Fuck, it's looking at us!
Hey, don't look at us, okay?
What the fuck!
So what do we do?
About?
We can't see Michel-Michel
with this in the trunk.
- Why?
- It's unprofessional.
No room for a suitcase in there.
- So?
- We're fucking screwed!
- Why?
- It was 500 on delivery.
Relax,
we can take the suitcase in the car.
We need a trunk, that's the mission!
The suitcase goes in the trunk.
- I got instructions.
- So let's empty the trunk.
We'll take out the crap
and free the fly.
Empty trunk.
Mission-wise, no more problem.
Yeah... yeah!
Toro.
- What?
- Wait.
Now it's stuck!
Oh no!
It won't open!
You slammed it too hard,
you broke it!
- Got the keys?
- The keys? You crazy?
Great, so we're fucked, cool.
This is bullshit!
Get in, let's beat it.
I think I have an idea.
No, we'll find another car.
We still have time.
Forget about your Michel-Michel mission,
fuck it.
Fuck the money too?
I don't think so.
Why don't we use the fly to make money?
- Money?
- Yep.
- With the fly?
- Yep.
- Wanna sell it?
- No.
Wanna take out an ad?
"Big live fly for sale."
No, we'll tame it.
Yeah, we'll tame it.
So once it starts trusting us,
we'll train it like a monkey, see?
See what?
Once trained,
we do what we want with it.
Flies fly.
- Don't you get it, Manu?
- Wait, Jean-Gab.
Michel-Michel is paying us 500
to deliver a suitcase from point A
to another point.
Sorry, but that's easier
than training an insect.
You're stupid. My idea can make us
a thousand times more.
Imagine it obeying us.
We can send it to a bank...
have it bring us back the bank money.
We sit pretty.
Like a fucking drone.
- A drone?
- Yep.
It's even better: no batteries required.
Wait.
- You mean the fly gets...
- Gets the stuff for us.
It gets the stuff for us and we...
sit pretty.
You get my drift?
No more Michel-Michel,
I quit my shit job...
- Get the picture?
- I mega-get it!
- Toro, ain't that killer?
- Killer!
I'm so into this!
We so gotta find a training zone.
We'll use your place.
I got kicked out.
- No way.
- I'm homeless.
Sucks.
Sucks big time.
Your place!
- With my mom there?
- Yeah.
Forget it, she'll bust us.
So we have no place.
Why don't we use that place?
What, that?
There's no one around to bother us.
Maybe they're inside, think.
- They?
- Like travelling people.
Gypsy people?
I mean, someone may live there.
I swear, it looks abandoned.
Uh... Dunno, can't tell from here.
Fuck!
Check out that loser!
- What next?
- Should I go talk to him?
No, let me.
I'm more of a people person.
Hello.
Private property.
You can't stay.
Private property. Get lost.
Private? There's no fence.
Should I put up a fence for you?
Private property. Get lost.
No, okay, sorry...
That's not what I really meant.
Why did I even bring up fences?
But uh...
Actually, my pal is sick.
He's drying out.
He needs water urgently.
- Drying out?
- Yeah.
Drying out.
If I give you water, you'll get lost?
I promise.
Don't move.
Nice blow!
This is our place now.
Toro!
Why?
Mom, cut it out,
you don't get the shit we're in.
Yes, I said I closed the station.
Yes!
The brown key, like every day.
But why...
I just wanted a five-minute break
and Manu...
Yeah, I'm with Manu.
Stop, you don't even know him.
No, you don't.
Okay, sure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
You're always right, same old tune.
Screw that.
When do I get my June pay?
What?
You won't be seeing me anytime soon.
Jesus...
Nice place, right?
Totally, it's great.
From out there, it looks tiny.
But no, it's just not that big.
There's food!
He's no joke.
Look.
Show it.
It's heavy.
It means it's real.
I'll take it.
Stop it, Dad, you never call either.
I barely ever ask anything.
For once, I'm in deep shit!
Pain in the ass.
You're a pain and you're old anyway.
Yeah, you're an old geezer.
Bye.
We're fucking screwed.
Can't call my sister.
No way! Not that retard.
- What about you?
- What?
Your family?
Great idea, I'll call my dead dad now.
I dunno, what about your mom?
Think she has a private phone
in the psych ward?
So what do we do for food?
- Still got the 20 I gave you?
- Yeah.
There we go.
This'll last us 2 days.
Then we'll see.
Hey guys, I got money.
How much?
What?
What's it to you?
We can make a deal.
Untie me and I'll give you my savings.
- No!
- No.
Don't be dumb, I hid 3,000 nearby.
Untie me and we'll go there together.
End of story.
We're okay with the 3,000.
Yeah.
And we'll keep the trailer too,
we need it for something.
Good idea.
We'll keep the trailer too.
Who cares?
Help me, what do I do?
Look.
So it can't fly away.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Go on, it's heavy.
Hold on.
Gentle, gentle...
There we go.
Put it on the bed.
I think it's happy here.
Flies are happy everywhere.
So I'll get the 3,000 with the old man.
And you start training it.
Toro!
Get in.
Where's the hiding place?
- Where to?
- Turn left.
All's cool.
Look.
Here.
See?
Yummy.
Want some?
I'll give you some. I'm a nice guy.
Here.
Fuck yeah!
Makes sense, you're hungry.
Shit.
We'll be turning right soon.
What was that big thing in your trunk?
A fly.
A fly?
Where's that thing? It fell.
I can't find it. What the fuck?
I don't get it. Don't you leave now!
Self-Toro!
Where's the geezer?
- What?
- I fucked up.
- Got the money?
- No. I'm pissed off, he split.
Stop screwing up.
I'm so pissed.
What happened?
3,000 was a good deal.
Don't rub the knife in the goat.
I'm so fucking pissed!
No way!
Yo, look.
It's asleep.
How can you tell?
You stupid or what?
- It's sleeping.
- How can you tell?
Obvious, isn't it?
Wait, what is this?
Hush!
You spent the 20 on cat food?
No, I bought pills too.
So it'll sleep.
Who the fuck cares?
I mean food-wise. What about us?
- Cut it out.
- It's just cat food.
Forget our plan or what?
Soon, it'll get us all the food we want.
The drone.
- I admit, that's a killer plan.
- Yeah.
But when's it for?
Dunno, a few days.
A few days?
Yeah, a few days.
- Manu?
- What?
She's pigging out. Starving!
Yeah, like us. And?
We'll need a lot more stock.
"Need, need"... You're a funny guy.
Look, she gobbles it up.
Can I watch my show in peace?
This is chicken.
Yeah, we'll see.
Can you stop that?
Calm down, okay?
Patience, he'll be back.
Stop it!
Move it.
Give my bud the bags.
Put your hands down.
I don't care.
Well, you can beat it now.
Walk that way for twenty minutes.
Stop and I'll shoot.
That should make you think.
Go, you're annoying.
Toro or what?
Yeah, Toro.
But did you get me my toy?
Great.
Look.
Want this?
Come.
Come and get it.
Here, here!
Come here.
You coming?
Come!
Come on!
Come and take it!
Look.
What are you allergic to?
What's your allergy?
Oil!
What do you mean?
How else should I say it?
I'm allergic to oil.
Fuck!
Look!
You see that?
See that? She took the toy!
Good job. You get a treat right away.
Here, look.
Good job! This is for you.
Bravo, beautiful! Oh yeah!
She loves minced meat. Wild!
You'll be trained real soon.
So no oil?
Yeah, no thanks.
Sure thing.
Oh no!
The food!
Jesus!
What did you do?
This is bad!
I did pork ribs too.
And mashed potatoes.
Only the food bothers you...
Yep.
What a waste!
Was that you?
What?
That noise. Was it you?
There was no noise.
Just listen!
It's Dominique.
Dominique?
Yeah, she's snoring.
Because I gave her tranquilizers
to sleep.
It's no big deal.
It's unbearable.
I can't sleep with that.
What do we do? You got a better idea?
Why "Dominique"?
What?
She has a name now?
How do I train her without a name?
Explain.
Okay, but... "Dominique"?
Find another name if you're so smart.
This is pure hell!
- Doesn't bother you?
- No.
Dominique! Hush!
Time for beddy-bye.
Beddy-bye, it's nighttime.
There.
No need to freak out.
And you snore too.
You do.
Good night.
Yeah, thanks.
I got an idea.
- Toro morn.
- Toro morn.
What's the idea?
We find a used-car dealer
and sell ours.
With some of the money,
we buy a new car,
cheaper,
something to drive and sleep in.
And with the rest of the money,
we buy tons of food for Dominique.
That way I can train her faster,
we can make money faster
and get rich faster.
Sound good?
Fuck this.
Nothing dumber than running out of gas.
And you came by the station too.
Yeah, I know.
Pull over.
So it is you. How crazy!
I spotted you right off.
Frédéric Breton! I'm floored!
What d'you call me?
Your name, Fred. You stupid or what?
Cécile Doyon, St Thomas High.
- Cécile?
- Handball team.
You kidding me?
You forgot everything?
No...
Isn't life incredible?
Fred!
Hello.
What brings you here?
I... How can I explain?
I'm helping a friend
who ran out of gas.
Darn!
A real pain as you can see.
Got any food?
Not on me. Why?
I'm crazy starving.
We haven't eaten since yesterday.
Wanna come by? We live up there.
Dunno, I barely know you.
Of course you know me, idiot.
Oh yeah, I know you!
- Meet us at the pool?
- You bet.
- You coming?
- What about Dominique?
She's fine, in the shade.
It's nice out.
She may freak out without me
in a new place.
Give her a pill and she'll sleep.
We won't stay long, no worries.
So this is Jean-Gab.
Hello.
We go back ages.
Come and swim.
You said something
about feeding ourselves.
No prob, kitchen's full.
- Feel at home.
- It's...
That way.
- Rich girl fridge!
- Gimme that ham.
Oh fuck!
Where did you meet those babes?
Never saw them, never met them.
One of them thinks I'm someone else.
What the fuck!
Cool, right?
- Big Toro!
- Toro!
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Excuse me.
You just got in?
Just a second ago.
Friends of my sisters'?
Yeah, I knew her from before.
Before when?
Before... A while ago.
How long a while?
A while like...
I gotta check a calendar.
Because it's been...
A long while.
I don't know her,
but he's told me about her.
Have you seen Marc again?
Marc?
Uh, wait...
Marc...
Marc, no. What?
You know, Marc.
You got the memory of a fly.
Oh yeah, Marc!
Yeah, he's...
He was a student with us, right?
Marc, who used to sell us grass.
Grass?
Why did we buy grass?
You kidding me?
Hey.
You dip-shit!
- What?
- My stuff.
It's water, it dries.
He's my brother.
Yeah.
Who are these retards she asked over?
- That's my thigh.
- Oh yeah?
Oh yeah.
Why not stay over?
We got 2 spare rooms. Perfect.
Yeah, why not?
Jean-Gab, what do you say?
About what?
About staying over.
They have spare rooms.
Yeah, but...
Dominique.
Who's Dominique?
It's his cousin, no big deal.
Yeah, my cousin.
It's a crazy story, it's...
Tell her to wait a little.
All alone?
Yeah, she's cool alone.
I dunno.
There's this one.
It's the biggest... but a little sad.
Yeah, it is a little.
My parents' room.
The only problem is it looks out back.
And there's tons of flies. It's a pain.
Fine, I don't care.
I'll take it.
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's perfect, I like it.
- I really love it.
- Great.
And you get my teenage room.
Cool, yeah.
You're okay with a small bed?
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh yeah!
Perfect.
Sure?
Lying on a bed is already amazing.
This is from 1999.
You must be on it.
Why?
The handball team!
Look.
There you are. Unmistakable!
He looks just like me!
It's you, dummy.
Oh yeah, it's me.
Remember how we fooled around?
Totally sucked.
First time, you came in 2 seconds.
Oh yeah.
You too.
No! You're so off.
No?
You had a tattoo on your thigh.
Where is it?
Yeah, I got it removed actually.
When I became an adult.
Too bad, it was cool.
Yeah but...
I grew up.
Yesterday,
she cooked us something so good.
She's the best. We eat so well.
Perfect, because we're starved to death.
Thanks for having us.
Because we sort of barged in.
So not true.
I saw you two do something so weird
in the kitchen.
A handshake.
Oh yeah, that.
Toro.
Yeah, Toro. What is it?
Nothing,
something we did as kids.
It's been ages.
We don't even notice.
Because your astrological sign
is Taurus?
- What?
- Astro what?
What?
So what is it?
No it's...
It's nothing. We do it for no reason.
Like uh... like when we agree.
Or when we're happy.
And to say hi too.
And goodbye.
And other emotions too.
How intriguing!
- Can we see?
- Show us!
It's really nothing special.
- We do this.
- Yep.
Then we check.
And we say "Toro".
Toro!
Sweet! So you do this?
Yep.
Let's do it.
Toro!
Why "Toro"? I don't get it.
What's this Toro thing?
Dude...
Doesn't my hand look like the animal?
Oh yeah.
I get it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Tonight I made turkey paupiettes!
With some Oregon, some fennel.
And obviously organic carrots
and potatoes
that come from the garden next door!
But my personal touch:
Port wine sauce.
Enjoy! Help yourselves!
Thanks!
Smells delicious.
Fuck yeah!
Beautiful, Agnès. You're the best.
Give me your plates.
- I call firsts!
- No!
Good grub!
We don't say "grub" here!
We say "cooked platter", "meal",
"food"!
Food... Good food!
Dig in!
Who taught you manners?
You're eating before everyone.
That's not done!
Didn't your parents teach you?
Stop, Agnès, he's an old friend.
No, she's right.
My parents taught me jackshit.
I know nothing of good manners.
I'm interested.
Tell me, when can I start eating?
Okay!
We'll repeat the rule
for our ignorant newcomers!
In all civilized dinners,
even during seaside vacations,
you eat once the mistress
finishes her first bite.
Okay, all right.
But you don't have to shout.
We're not dogs.
- She's not shouting.
- She is.
- It's normal.
- Is it?
Don't worry, forget it.
I have a vocal problem.
- Vocal?
- What's the problem?
She had brain damage
after a ski accident.
It's just the way she talks.
It's not against you.
- Oh yeah.
- Okay!
She's not angry.
Think I find it funny?
Honestly!
No, I'm sorry.
How did you fall?
- On your skull?
- Let's move on.
I'm taking my first bite.
It's delicious.
Enjoy, everyone.
Glad you like it, Cécile!
I made it the best I could.
Enjoy, everyone!
Try not to waste any!
Go on.
Take it.
- Got it?
- Yep.
- Toro!
- Toro!
There you go.
- No one saw you?
- It's all cool.
Poor girl, alone in the car all day.
She's a fly. She's clueless.
She's clued into everything!
Hey, look.
I got you a paupiette.
I think about you.
Okay, I'm hitting the hay.
- Toro night.
- Toro night.
Good, isn't it?
You think you can just hit on me
without anyone noticing?
No, that's bull. But...
this is my room!
Oh yeah?
Just got here
and you think you own the place!
It's not your room!
It's Cécile's teenage room!
Okay but...
I was told I could sleep here.
Hey, stop staring at my bosoms!
Like a pig!
You wish.
I'm only here to sleep.
Oh yeah?
You're gonna have to wait
because I'm here.
Jean-Gab!
What?
That lunatic kicked me out.
I gotta sleep with you now.
No way, I'm in mid-training.
Why "no way"? Let me in.
No, it's really tough with her.
She won't listen.
I gotta start over.
It's different with you here.
I need to be alone.
Dude, where do I sleep?
- Want me to tame her or not?
- Sure I do.
Tell me if it's off,
so I don't bust my balls for nothing.
It's still on. We move forward.
So okay. I need some time.
It's a huge house. Just find a bed.
Okay, I'll manage.
Fine. Goodnight.
- Tame her fast.
- No worries.
Hey.
Hey.
Slept here?
Yep.
Starry skies...
More like a bum.
But I'm used to it.
Later.
Sure, later.
Yeah!
Coming.
Why are you locked up in there?
I tried to come in
but the door was locked from the inside.
What are you up to?
I dunno, nothing...
- Sleeping.
- Yeah, right!
Of course!
I heard you talking all night.
You weren't sleeping.
Stop lying!
- What are you doing?
- No... there's nothing.
I just don't like being seen naked.
So I locked the door.
- So let me see.
- No, there's no seeing!
What is it?
Something moved behind you!
I know.
It's because of your accident.
Yeah, you must have like hallucinations.
So easy to blame it on my handicap.
You want some proof?
What's this?
It's excrement!
I found it in the car.
You searched our car?
You're a total nutjob.
I didn't search!
It was on the back meat
of your shitty Mercedes.
You can't even afford a decent Mercedes!
Backseat, not back meat!
You're totally hung up on food.
Play on words!
I know what it is!
- Oh yeah?
- I know what it is!
I wanna know, tell me.
Yeah, I'll tell you.
You're hiding a dog in there!
Gotcha!
- A dog?
- Yeah!
Yeah... Yeah, we have a dog.
I knew it!
Liar! I'll spill the beans!
I'm telling Cécile and Serge!
We'll see if they're happy to find out
their parents who hate animals
had a dog in their room!
Come on, relax!
It's just a dog!
You'll get kicked out of here.
You and your buddy
who hit on me!
Last night!
Here!
Beat it, you lunatic!
Those scuzzballs staying long?
No comment.
I invite whoever I want.
They're funny.
Why do you judge them?
Come on, they're retards.
No, it's Fred Breton. Remember?
Remember one of the 800 dicks you took?
Shut your face!
Okay! I'll tell you everything!
Something's fishy about those two guys.
Big time!
Open up, it's me.
All good?
Yes and no.
Can you find a dog? It's urgent.
- A dog?
- Yeah.
- What for?
- Don't go there.
Find a dog, bring it back,
or we'll be kicked out.
Okay, a dog.
Hurry.
Cécile, 20 years we're friends!
- Still don't trust me?
- Yeah, but I dunno.
I believe you. They are fishy.
I don't care about you!
I'm talking to Cécile!
There was no dog.
Who saw a dog?
No dog? Really?
Don't talk when you don't know!
So tell me! What's this?
- Fuck!
- Yuck. What is it?
Dog excrement!
- Wanna taste to be sure?
- Gross!
- Why was it in your pocket?
- I found it in their car!
Believe it or not!
I'm telling you! Believe you me!
On the backseat!
- Who is it?
- Me.
Look. Will this do?
Perfect. You're the top. Toro!
What's it for?
I'll explain, okay.
- Listening good?
- Yeah.
Over there!
Assholes closed the shutters
so we can't see!
"Assholes" now?
I close the shutters too when I sleep.
Means nothing.
It's not like they killed anyone.
- What about this?
- In Mom and Dad's room.
Okay, I'll handle this.
- But how?
- I'll talk to them.
Kick them out!
They may be K-9 bums.
- I told you he's an old friend!
- Big one slept outside.
Coming.
Smuggling in animals...
Shut up!
So?
So I made it up?
Yeah, it's true. We have a dog.
- So cute.
- Sweety...
Come on, girls!
No way!
Don't be swayed.
So cute!
A dog, just like I said!
Sorry. We wanted to tell you but...
Your parents' room and all...
It's cool, it's tiny, no sweat.
Dad's allergic to dog hair.
No, he's allergic to hamsters.
Sorry to be so perceptive,
but how can such a small dog
create so much excrement?
Why are you still hung up on the shit?
You're unbearable.
Unbearable?
Yeah, unbearable.They apologized.
You're a pain!
Me?
Unbearable?
Sorry.
We didn't wanna cause trouble.
Well, it's too late.
Unbearable?
Let's go talk to her.
Maybe leave it in the room
till things calm down.
You got it.
- We'll see later.
- Yeah, yeah.
Cool.
- Toro lie.
- Toro lie.
You gotta see this!
- What?
- Look.
Domi!
Come here.
Look at me.
Good girl.
This side.
Wait.
Go back!
Back.
Holy fuck!
Go back more.
Okay or what?
100% okay!
We'll hit the jackpot.
Jean-Gab?
You slay!
I'm gonna punch it.
Take this!
On three, climb on. One, two, three!
- In your face.
- I wasn't ready.
Darn it!
This is unbelievable!
You enjoy bothering people who...
who are trying to relax?
I'm warning you, Cécile!
You disappoint me
with your lying friends.
Thanks for the shitty vacation!
Goodbye!
Where are you, doggy?
How many dogs are there
in this room?
Agnès?
You okay?
What happened?
Agnès, why did you shout?
Out of the way.
You okay, honey?
- What is it?
- Why is she in this room?
Why did you shout?
Come on.
Why are you in here?
You okay?
Earth to Agnès!
Can you see us?
Look at me.
What's this?
Jesus fuck!
No way!
What?
The dog.
What about it?
It was tied up there.
She fucking ate it.
I swear she did.
Oh fuck!
You eat dogs, psycho?
No way...
Are you crazy?
You're a schizoid!
You ate a dog?
Gross!
You're gone fucking apeshit!
- How sick!
- Yeah, sick!
She's a monster!
This is horrible.
How could she?
Dominique!
Where the hell are you?
There you are!
Where were you?
Come on, let's go.
No use trying to understand.
This kind of thing can't be explained.
You know,
we see crazy stuff every day.
The world is out of whack.
People go haywire.
We can't change it.
- Still...
- I get it but...
This is a friend. It's different.
Eating a little dog is so vile.
Who does that?
Look on the bright side.
There were no deaths.
Actually, there was.
I was talking humans, you know.
Whose dog was it?
It was yours, say it.
Yeah, yeah.
Mine and my buddy's.
We share ownership.
You're not sad?
Dunno.
It hasn't sunk in yet.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, it hasn't sunk in, that...
Yeah, yeah.
They gave me a big shot.
Now I talk softly.
It's so nice to speak more softly.
Can't imagine.
Yeah, it's nice for me too.
I should always get these shots.
That'd be cool.
I think that's in your future.
They'll treat you well.
But one last thing
before I fall asleep.
It's really important.
Okay.
There was a fly in there.
Yeah, that room's full of flies.
No, it was a huge, repulsive fly.
That's why I shouted.
And I think the fly ate the dog.
So you should go see the officers.
You tell them the truth, they let me go
and we finish our summer together,
you know.
No honey, you screwed up.
What?
You screwed up big time.
Cécile, listen, it wasn't me.
You know me.
Come on...
I can't help, sorry.
Cécile, it wasn't me!
It's the fly!
What you doing?
- You stupid?
- It's a souvenir.
This is some crazy shit!
But it's a bad memory, dummy!
- You're being sleazy!
- Bug off!
Constant criticism!
My respects.
I just have this paper
for you to sign.
It's nothing.
It just says...
you're satisfied
with our intervention today,
that it went well,
that we showed respect
and that we fulfilled
all your expectations.
That's it.
So it lets us show our superiors
the job was well done.
So you can reread it.
Okay.
And sign in the box,
only if you're satisfied, obviously.
Here.
Thank you.
I don't fucking believe it!
- Cécile?
- Yeah.
You don't recognize me?
Excuse me?
Fred!
Fred Breton!
- That's impossible.
- Why impossible?
You want proof?
Wait, I'll give you proof.
Look.
Ring a bell or what?
Fred?
Yeah, old friend!
- So who's the other one?
- No idea.
This is fucking freaky.
- The other what?
- There's another Fred.
Yeah, plenty of Freds!
Common first name.
What are the odds?
How cool!
Manu! We got busted.
We gotta go!
Go on.
Try again.
Move it!
Great seeing you.
Too bad it was
in extenuating circumstances.
That's life.
That was wild! See that?
Killer skid too!
Toro we escaped the girl
who thought she knew me?
Toro we escaped the girl...
Who thought she knew me.
So what now?
We're back to square one.
Lemme try something.
Yes, yes.
Hold on, someone's here.
I'm here for the mission.
For Michel-Michel.
Is this the place?
Yes.
Can I talk to him?
Raimondo's guy who never showed up
just showed up.
Really?
He's here.
Go get him.
Sit down.
So.
Tell me.
I had serious trouble.
So uh...
I'm 3 days late, I know.
I'm sorry.
But I wanted to tell you
I'm still up for it.
And I have a car with a trunk.
It's all good, I'm ready.
Fine.
Okay then.
Jean-Gab!
I'm coming.
How did it go?
Seriously?
Too cool, Michel-Michel!
Master, this young man
has something for you.
I got this for you.
Yes, from Michel-Michel.
It's about time, you're late.
We're sorry.
We had an incident with an insect.
But anyway...
Anyway, here, I have the suitcase.
Okay, let's see.
My God.
Wonderful.
Show us.
Like it?
- Great, Dad.
- Beautiful.
Cool, I love it.
Here.
You can go now. Thank you.
Manu!
- What?
- Come!
- Now?
- Yeah, come!
What?
She's ready.
Dominique.
- What about her?
- She's ready.
No kidding?
- It's done.
- Really?
100%.
Today's the big day.
Cool with me. What do we do?
A test.
Yeah, a test.
See this? This!
You go get it for me, okay?
I know you can do it. This!
I know you can do it. For me.
Okay? Understand?
This.
Go get this.
She got it.
- Think so?
- Yeah, it'll work.
Hold still.
There.
I'm all emotional.
Dominique, you understand,
you go get...
Fuck.
Know what?
What if she never returns?
What are you saying?
She'll be back.
No, I'm just saying...
even if she doesn't come back,
your project fails
and we don't get rich...
- Yeah, and?
- It's no big deal.
Actually, I don't even care.
What?
It's no big deal.
Look, we're cool here.
Yeah.
But uh...
You really think she won't return?
Seriously, Jean-Gab...
it's a fly.
Yep.
You're right, it's a fly.
Why bust our balls trying to get rich?
I dunno, me and my projects...
It's me too. It's my fault.
We just wanted dough.
Exactly.
You know what?
True wealth is friendship.
Manu, Toro emotion!
Toro emotion.
I get grandiose
because I'm with my buddy.
And who knows
what'll happen tomorrow?
I feel really great now.
Yeah.
Me too.
- We don't give a fuck!
- Yeah, we don't.
- Who cares?
- Who cares?
Let's celebrate it with some coffee.
How much is left?
Maybe even a sandwich!
Yeah, totally.
I got 8 euros...
50 cents. 8.50.
- Let's go for it.
- You bet.
