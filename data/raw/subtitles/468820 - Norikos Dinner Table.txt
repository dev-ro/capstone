NORIKO´S DINNER TABLE
December 2001
I tore off a thread that was
dangling from my coat.
I had run away fromm home.
I arrlved at Tokyo Station.
Femmale, age 17.
Just a kid. That was me.
I carried my big bag pretendlng
I had just returned fromm a trip.
WaIked to Glnza.
It was rlght before Christmas.
Bright wlth neon lights.
Everyone was better dressed than me,
and Iooked cool.
NORIKO
I had a father, a mother,
and a sister named Yuka.
I´m done.
Eat, Noriko.
When she has a problem,
she can´t think of anything eIse.
I was 17. Junlor in high schooI.
Always flghtlng with mmy father about college.
He wanted me to go to a IocaI university,
but I didn´t want to.
I knew it wouId be boring.
I wouldn´t flnd a boyfriend
or even a friend there.
He peeIed a tangerine
and put the peel in the ashtray.
Boys in Tokyo are worthIess. . . and. . .
He hesitated to say.
But I knew. My cousins.
Sato and Kel got pregnant
while studying ln Tokyo.
Taeko? HeI Io.
Sato and Kei just came by.
Dad thought,
girIs go to Tokyo, get pregnant.
Boys are troubIe. . .
I watched the neatly folded peel ln the ashtray
slowly return to lts origlnaI shape.
Tangerine, tangerine. . .
Orange-colored tangerine.
I had a friend nammed Tangerine
in elementary school.
I thought people caIled her that
because her cheeks were orange.
I had thought that. . .
But I was wrong.
One day, when I was wlth Yuka,
sommeone stopped me on the street.
Norippe?
Remember me?
It´s me. Tangerine.
I didn´t recognize her at flrst.
Tangerine, age 17.
What´s up, Norippe?
No one caIled mme that anymore.
My namme´s Noriko.
Do you know which school
this uniform is from?
Her uniformm?
You have no idea, right?
´Cause it´s my costume, actuaI ly.
It wasn´t her schooI uniformm.
She said that after junlor high. . .
. . . she began worklng at an "image club"
dresslng up and doing erotic thlngs.
I ´m handing out packets of t issues for work. Here.

"AI I-GirI Fantasy School"
I´ve heard of this pIace.
The "AI l-Girl Fantasy SchooI," right?
That´s the school l go to now.
And this is my route there.
That was the day l found out why she was
caIled Tangerine.
Okay, class. Who do you admire?
Mom and Dad.
In 2nd grade, the teacher asked,
"Who do you admire?"
Tangerine.
That´s how I got my nickname.
You didn´t know?
No.
I don´t know why l said that.
Maybe l reaI ly I iked tangerines.
She Iaughed loudly.
She Iooked happy.
Gotta go to work.
Nice seeing you.
Bye.
I sti I l Iove tangerines.
She waved goodbye and left.
On our way home,
Yuka and l talked about our Iives.
I was shocked that
Tangerine aIready had a job.
I admire Tangerine.
She´s independent.
So am I.
You don´t understand.
What?
Life as a woman.
Tangerine is reaI ly I iving.
All l did was sklp class and read
novels intended for adult wommen.
Tangerine was so lnsplring to me.
Idiot.
Yuka calIed me an ldiot.
She´s a whore.
You don´t even I ike being a woman.
You wish you were a man.
All l´m saying is,
she´s mature.
Are you saying that ´cause Dad is
always telling you to grow up?
Gotta go. Bye.
AduIts. . .
My father was an adult. . .
He was a reporter for a local
newspaper caIIed the Tlny Tokal Tlmes.
It didn´t matter if there was a war
abroad or massive earthquake
Come here!
Yeah, I´m coming.
- lt was a deer?
- Yes.
they only reported local news. . .
Wild deer destroyed the rlce fieId.
Ah, but today is a wonderful day.
"Deer Rampage Continues"
Trivlal, local news.
"Shoppers Galore"
Great. Look this way. Okay, cheese.
"Cactus Park Breaks 4O Mi l I ion Visitors"
"Cactus Park Breaks 4O Mi l I ion Visitors"
Just peacefuI stuff.
I love this town... and I love you and Yuka, too.
I love this town... and I love you and Yuka, too.
I had no lnterest in his work.
I love this town... and I love you and Yuka, too.
I love this town... and I love you and Yuka, too.
But I ended up writlng
for the school newspaper.
But I ended up writlng
for the school newspaper.
PubIished once a month.
I was edltor-ln-chlef.
and aIways runnlng around schooI.
Let´s ask for more computer time.
Pleased to meet you.
This is our new reporter, Machida.
I thought Dad´s paper was
too complacent.
So, by wrlting pleces opposed to school rules,
I felt l was rebelIing against Dad.
For example, advocatlng unIimlted
access to computers.
I think we shouId be able to
use the computers anytime we want.
´Cause if we could,
then we´d get much more. . .
. . . information.
I think we deserve that.
Yeah, but. . .
The ruIes must be changed.
We need information.
We onIy had one PC at home.
DefinteIy not enough.
I´m stiI l using it.
Come back in 2 hours.
Cactus Park was fun, huh?
Let´s go there again.
Noriko angry because she can´t use
the computer. lt´s a scoop!
One more picture.
Let´s take a picture together here.
Excuse me, wouId you mind?
Thank you.
Let´s go over there.
I was a teenage girl stuck in the boondocks.
I wanted to taIk to girls all over the country,
so I wanted to go onllne all the timme.
Gotta get out of here.
Go somewhere different.
What?
I´m definitely going.
Am I crazy?
Whatever.
I wanted to go somewhere different,
but I didn´t know where.
I wanted to go somewhere different,
but I didn´t know where.
Stubborn, dltsy, rebeIllous, reckIess.
I had to go forward.
After a whlIe, the teacher decided
we couId use the PCs until 5 PM.
What´s the verdict?
Good news, we can grant your request.
ReaI Iy?
Can I go use them now?
I had a favorite website.
A strange name. . .
It was called Haikyo. com.
There, 16- and 17-year-old girIs talked
about schooI and life.
I qulckIy became a reguIar member.
My username - Mltsuko.
The name of French perfume.
When l becamme Mitsuko,
I was no longer a nalve country glrI.
And I mmade some friends.
HeIlo, Cripple #5.
I´m Mitsuko.
"To Mitsuko: Hel Io. "
HeIlo, Long Neck.
HeIlo, Mldnight.
HeIlo, Broken Dam.
"To Mitsuko: Hel Io. "
And Ueno Station 54. . .
HeIlo, Ueno Statlon 54.
"To Mitsuko: Hel Io. "
Whenever Ueno Station 54 showed up,
It felt Iike we aIl became unlted.
It was llke we were aIl standlng on a
plucked guitar string.
And the conversatlon would begin.
Like a conversatlon in Morse code. . .
I´m waIking. . .
There´s a plucked guitar strlng and. . .
I´m on top of lt.
I was happy and surprlsed that
I found my best friends Iike thls.
They were glrls ln Tokyo.
I had to go to Tokyo.
They were glrls ln Tokyo.
I had to go to Tokyo.
(Everything OK?)
But you haven´t even met
Ueno in person.
As I was about to tell hlm
that l wouldn´t get pregnant in Tokyo. . .
...to meet my frlends...
The power went out.
Our house was very old.
The breaker switch wouId often go off.
No big deal.
Momm sIowly got up.
Looks I ike the breaker has switched off.
Yuka came out of her roomm.
Turn the power back on, Dad.
Taeko, is everything all right?
The breaker isn´t fixing it.
Dec. 10, 2001.
I had lived in Toyokawa for 17 years.
A cold winter night.
I was so cold and confused.
In the dark, l packed my bags.
Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo. . .
I had no ldea what was in Tokyo,
but I declded to gamble.
I had to find out.
I had to gamble.
The important things in my room. . .
my diary, money, necklace, favorlte shirt. . .
I looked for alI the thlngs I couldn´t leave behind
What did l reaIly need?
What ls it?
I was born to breathe.
I wasn´t breathing just because l was born.
I lnhaIed oxygen and exhaIed
carbon dloxide. l felt aIive.
I wanted to go somewhere different,
but I didn´t know where.
Femmale, 17, ditsy, stubborn, rebeIllous.
Just a kid. That was me.
I just reallzed that l was a vlrgin.
Never even had a boyfrlend.
Everything made me feeI anxlous.
Just everythlng. But I cherished the feeIing...
I was worried about everything and nothing.
But I loved those worrles.
Men, llfe, love, growlng up. . .
Things were weird.
Life was welrd.
I wanted to tackle somethlng.
I had to go somewhere to flnd it.
I wanted to Iive, chaIlenge, wish,
forget, learn, know, ask. . .
. . . see, stare, understand, hear,
Iisten, speak, mmeet. . .
. . . and be there.
I wanted to stand on with my own heart.
I wanted to waIk on my own legs.
I had to talk to Ueno Statlon 54.
So I logged on to Halkyo. com.
I knew she´d be there.
www. haikyo. com
To the message board.
"Ueno Station 54?
It´s Mitsuko. "
"l finaIIy ran away fromm home
and came to Tokyo. "
"l´m at an lnternet cafe now.
I´lI stay in a cheap hotel tonight. "
"Can we meet in person tomorrow?
I´m free alI day. "
"Maybe I´ll be free forever. "
"l´ve been pretending to be busy until now.
I feel naked. "
"Suddenly wlthout restralnt,
I feel klnd of naked. "
"Llke I´mm waIklng around naked.
I´m a Iittle self-consclous. "
"Today, l reaIized l´m stilI a virgln. "
"Maybe that´s because
I feel naked now. "
I sound I ike any other girI.
Did I dlsappolnt her?
We met onIine thls past summer.
Ueno Station 54 had been a mmoderator
on this site for a long time.
- "To Mitsuko: How are you?"
- "To Ueno Station 54: Fine. "
She replied to alI the mmessages
from girls crying for help.
HeI lo, l´m Mitsuko.
"Be strong, Mitsuko. "
"You can do it, Mi tsuko! !"
"You can do it, Mi tsuko! !"
I became Mitsuko and tried so hard
to be just like Ueno Statlon 54.
I became Mitsuko and tried so hard

"You have it hard, too"
I became Mitsuko and tried so hard

I became Mitsuko and tried so hard
to be just like Ueno Statlon 54.
I wondered. Could Norlko meet
Ueno Station 54 ln person?
I realized that I wasn´t Mitsuko.
Sommething obvlous I just now reaIized.
I was afraid that Ueno Station 54
wouIdn´t want to meet me.
I received her reply.
She wrote
"l´Il be at Ueno Statlon #54 at 11 AM. "
I went to Ueno right away.
Ueno at night was eerier than Ginza.
SHIMABARA
MlTSUKO
I set mmy aIarm for 9 AM.
I needed 2 hours to get ready.
Be ready emotionally, breakfast,
makeup. . . No, just to be ready emotionally.
I faded into darkness.
But I was rlpe.
I was ripe for growth.
I didn´t dream. But when l got up,
I felt llke I was ln a dreamm.
Being active, l was happy.
I was Mitsuko.
Once agaln, l tore off a thread
dangling from my coat.
I had left home...
and threw away that thread into the past.
I didn´t know what
Ueno Station #54 mmeant.
Where is #54?
I don´t know.
What´s #54?
No idea. Sorry.
Almost 11 AM.
I walked around the station.
I should have left my Iuggage wlth the hotel.
1O5.
133.

It´s close.

Ueno Station 54?
Mitsuko?
6 months later,
at Shinjuku Station. . .
That happened.
54 high schooI girIs threw
themselves in front of a train.
They hide their inner seIves.
According to the pol ice press conference:
The 54 gi rIs were. . .
"7:29 PM, Track 8"
According to the pol ice press conference:
The 54 gi rIs were. . .
According to the pol ice press conference:
The 54 gi rIs were. . .
Here is an eyewitness test imony.
What a tragic occurrence.
According to the poI ice press conference:. . .
The 54 girIs were not aI l from the same
high schooI. There are no suicide notes.
I t was horrible.
The pIatform was drenched in blood. . .
"54 Dead at Shinjuku"
I t was horrible.
The pIatform was drenched in blood. . .
I wanted to be silIy.
Just like alI mmy cIassmmates.
Like aII the girls my age,
I wanted to Iaugh Ioudly and be silly.
I hated crying.
I didn´t wanna cry.
YUKA
Yuka, stop.
Thought I´d jump?
Just kidding.
Ever considered suicide?
No.
Maybe my sister killed herself.
Being slIly.
You know the recent
mass suicide in Tokyo?
At Shinjuku?
I hear most victims
remain unidentified.
They´re stil I trying to
separate the bodies.
54 totaI.
Hand in hand. . . One, two, three!
Hand in hand. . . One, two, three!
I hated being silly.
You sound amused.
But I couldn´t help it.
They jumped so happi Iy, right?
Maybe my sister was there.
No, she just ran away.
Probably with some guy.
You think so?
Yeah.
Maybe.
What, you want her dead?
I understand, Sis.
I know everythlng.
I know you´re alive somewhere.
I hear your heartbeat.
You know how they managed to
meet at Shinjuku?
I know you´re alive somewhere.
I hear your heartbeat.
I know you´re alive somewhere.
I hear your heartbeat.
54 of them were from different
high schooIs.
54 of them were from different
high schooIs.
I know.
How?
It´s a secret.
A secret?
And I know what it is.
Hey, common. Tel I me, Yuka.
Wait, Yuka. Tel I me!
Stop! Check this out.
What?
The red dots are women.
The white ones are men.
Stop.
Fine.
What´s this?
The night before the mass suicide,
54 new red dots appeared.
It´s a signaI.
A signaI? For suicide?
Yeah.
Or maybe a threat.
What´s this?
Am l connected to mmyseI f, Sis?
"Are you connected to yourself?"
Am l connected to mmyseI f, Sis?
Ueno Station 54?
Mitsuko?
Hi, l´m Kumiko.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
This is my dad.
Hi, l´m Kumiko´s father.
My mom.
I´m her mother.
I´m her brother.
Nice to meet you.
Let´s go, Mitsuko.
Dec. 2001. l wrote thls on Haikyo. com.
Are you listening, Yuka?
Dec. 2001. l wrote thls on Haikyo. com.
Are you listening, Yuka?
"That day, l was suffering from PMS,
and rubblng my stomach. "
"l thought about my sister Yuka.
I knew she was worried about mme. "
"We got in thelr van and drove to
Kummiko´s grandmother´s house. "
Grandma!
"Her grandma came out and
hugged Kumiko´s brother. "
"The grandma and Kumiko´s parents
hugged, too. She was moved. "
"WhenKumiko sald, ´Hi, Grandma, ´
she started crying"
I wondered what Yuka wouId thlnk
if she saw this.
I kind of thought she had been
postlng on the board.
This girl "Yoko" sounded llke Yuka.
Was it Yuka?
See ya.
Wait. Hey, wait up!
I wondered what she´d think
if she found out about me.
"Yuka, l ´m good friends with
everyone on this site. "
"Surprised? We´re both here now,
so be nice to me, 0K?"
"Understand, Yuka?"
"By the way,
are you connected to yourseIf?"
"l wrote about Ueno Statlon 54 before.
Ueno Station Locker #54. "
"When she decided to call herself
Ueno Station 54. . . "
"that´s when it aI l began. "
I come here every night at 8
to check on my stuff.
Dad gave me this music box
for Christmas when l was 6.
"None of the stuff was actuaIly hers. "
This pink dress is what my mom wore
To the hospitaI when my brother was born
Cute.
Yeah?
This is the harmonica l used during
Game Day in kindergarten.
"She just coIlected a bunch of stuff
that people had left behind. "
"And made up her own storles. "
These rain boots were the first things
I asked Mom to buy me.
But it didn´t rain much,
so I wore them on a sunny day.
"She had no genuine memories.
She just dldn´t give a shlt. "
You wanna put a memory in here?
Me?
This.
"Ever since l met Kumiko,
I´ve been thinklng that. . . "
". . . she and l are slmilar. Maybe it means
I´m fabrlcatlng my past to become a new woman. "
"l´m no longer Noriko.
I´m Mitsuko, the new me. "
What´s this?
Mitsuko´s umbi I ical cord.
"l finaIIy became the person
I aIways wanted to be. "
Okay, Mitsuko.
Your umbi I ical cord is here.
"Everythlng is our made-up story.
Isn´t it wonderful, Yuka?"
"No End to Rash of Suicides"
Let´s go.
Right.
The pomelos are doing well this year.
- What about damage from the birds?
- Well. . .
Tetsu, take a picture. pIease.
Okay.
I declded to become Yoko,
and be connected to myself.
I declded to become Yoko,
and be connected to myself.
A clue for Dad.
I wondered lf he´d notlce.
Free tissues.
I kept hearing my slster´s voice,
Iike a radlo that wouIdn´t turn off.
My sister´s voice. . .
Taeko. Taeko. . .
Dad was shocked that
I folIowed in mmy sister´s footsteps.
Where are you?
It was a mmonth after l ran away. . .
. . . that Dad finalIy started
Iooking thoroughly for cIues.
"Daddy"
He quit his job rlght after l Ieft.
Listen. . .
I quit.
For a few weeks, he had searched
for me and my sister.
But he Iacked
any understanding of us.
FinalIy, he started Iooking for
clues in our room. . .
I stopped writlng right there.
I was ln class.
I was just thinklng If l ran away
Iike mmy sister, what wouId my father, Tetsuzo, do?
What would he do?
How would he know anythlng about us?
The cIue l had Ieft for himm?
My father, Tetsuzo, would find it accidentalIy
behind that poster in our room.
"Yuka´s handwritlng, "
he´d thlnk.
"Ueno Station 54 Haikyo"
A month later, Tetsuzo´s wife Taeko
started to help him.
They searched thelr daughters´room
and obtalned pieces of informmatlon.
They checked every website
that thelr daughters had vislted.
"1. Noriko was frlends with
a woman named Ueno Statlon 54. "
"2. Ueno Statlon 54 meant
the Iocker #54 at Ueno Station. "
Tetsuzo, a former reporter,
knew what he was doing.
Meanwhile, he stopped sharlng
information with hls wlfe.
- What´s wrong?
- Nothing.
He thought it would be llke saylng
he knew where an alien base was.
Like saylng aIiens had
abducted Yuka and Noriko.
There was no way
he wouId say anything.
He became more and more convinced
that his supposltion was correct.
He was afrald. It would be wading into
an unbelievabIy large amount of magma.
He was sure that hls wife would
ridlcule him lf he told her.
"Sulcide Club Exists. " The tabIold
headline matched hls concIusion.
He knew the Sulcide CIub existed.
He had been fooling himself that. . .
. . . Toyokawa was some kind of paradise,
apart from the dangers of the worId.
Simple Toyokawa had become a bIeeding corpse.
Because of the Suiclde Club?
"What´s your connectlon to you,
and to your famlly?"
"How are you connected to yourself?"
Tetsuzo felt the cIub was asking hlm.
Dec. 11, 2002.
After 3 months of investigation,
he wrote the following
"1. The Sulcide Club exists. "
"2. Members mmeet on Halkyo. comm"
"3. The dots onHaikyo. com
represent sulcides. "
"The white ones are men.
The red ones are women. "
What was l writing?
Where´s Tangerine?
I don´t know.
On to the Iast scene.
This ls where the troubIe beglns.
What has the power to get the magma flowing?
Tetsuzo tried to specuIate. . .
But he toId hlmseIf to
Iook only at the facts.
He wrote so hard that he couId see
his writing on the next page.
Wait. . .
What lf l tore thls page from
my notebook and went to Tokyo. . .
Who would shade my bIank pages
with a penclI to discover what l wrote?
I mmanaged to reach my slster´s heart.
WouId Dad reach mine?
Nobody would care about my imprint.
People vanish alI the time.
A beautlfuI day ln Toyokawa. . .
That was the last time
I saw the ocean.
And the last time
I watched the sunset there.
KUMIKO
What´s wrong?
Nothing.
PMS?
Kumiko. . . Ueno Station?
CaI l me Ueno Station if you want.
ReaI name?
Here.
HeI lo.
Grandma, it´s been so long.
The first day, we went to
Kummiko´s grandma´s house.
I´m aImost done with elementary school.
Good for you.
Maybe l shouId give you a gift.
I wasn´t reIated to them at aIl,
but I was there. . .
. . . and it was cozy.
They were the epitome of happiness.
It was so great to see them.
I had lived as a member of the
Shimabara famlIy for 17 years.
But we had been cold and distant.
The bonds holding Kumiko´s family together
were like fat pipes.
Each relationship an artery of happlness
for them.
Kummiko´s happy family.
I wanted so badIy to be
a member of thls family.
We´ll visit again.
We waved and sald goodbye to Grandma. . .
. . . and then Ieft for another
grandmother´s house.
Come on, Mitsuko.
The other grandmother aIso
gave us a hearty welcome.
How are you?
They greeted each other.
This time l wasn´t so nervous for some reason.
The conversatlon went on exactly
as at the Iast house.
This is my classmate Mitsuko.
Thanks.
The most ldeal brother ln the worId.
Kummiko helped her mom in the kitchen.
The perfect mother and daughter.
Hey, Shingo! Common! Dad!
Kummiko´s dad gave Grandma
a shouIder massage.
CouId there be a more famlIy-llke family
anywhere in the world?
Make yourseIf at home, Mitsuko.
She caIled mme Mitsuko.
I, as Mltsuko, became
a member of thls family.
"The most important thing
You must be connected to yourself, Yuka. "
"l´m connected to myself, Yuka"
"You understand, Yuka?"
The members of Kummiko´s famlIy
were connected to themseIves.
Wait 5 minutes, then come inside.
Okay. . .
Grandpa.
You´re late, Mitsuko.
Where were you?
Mitsuko.
Come see your grandfather.
Mitsuko is here.
Mitsuko. . .
Come cIoser. . .
Grandpa!
Grandpa.
The new girl is good.
He I ikes you.
Good job.
You even change your toothbrush
to suit each client.
Pick yours.
I´l I take this one.
A great story opens your eyes.
There´s this one story. . .
There was a baby born in a Iocker.
Born in a locker?
Years later, the mother found out
the girI´s whereabouts and went to. . .
. . . see her.
No way.
They met.
ReaI Iy?
Yeah, but the woman was a bad actress.
She sucked at playing a mother.
Once upon a time, there was a family.
Parents and two daughters.
They were seemingly happy.
However. . .
The mother was smart and polite.
The father was hard-working.
But he didn´t try to understand
his daughters. Their individuality.
That´s why they ran away.
The first tlme in Tokyo´s Suginaml Ward.
Stray cats roammed the back alleys
Iike bIood flows through a vein.
Stray cats form fami I ies instantly.
No need to feeI sorry for them.
They´re tough. They own this town.
We have to reIate to each other
I ike stray cats do.
We own Tokyo, OK?
We do?
CooI.
While I was chewing gum,
I thought. . .
"Yes, we own Tokyo. "
A mlddIe-aged man came out.
Unkempt hair. Unshaven face.
What are you wearing?
Get in.
We went lnside.
At that polnt, l had no idea
what l was supposed to do.
But I knew Kumiko would teIl me.
This way.
I walked down the halI.
I saw mmany mortuary tabIets
placed on the family aItar.
Photographs.
His famlIy, probably.
We went lnto the livlng room
and foIlowed hls orders.
Sit!
He Iit a cigarette.
I sensed that he was mmy "father. "
I looked at Kumiko.
She Iooked cute lost ln refIection.
She cIosed her eyes.
I saw shlny droplets under her long bangs.
Don´t cry, stupid.
But. . .
I´m not a kid anymore.
Let me do what I want.
Dad.
My turn.
Dad Iooked at mme with teary eyes.
I loved Dad.
I was his daughter.
He was a Ionely, stubbornman.
Suddenly, l had a vision
of the Tiny Tokai Times.
Headline "Dad ls Lonely"
No, not true.
That wasn´t my dad.
My reaI dad was sltting in front of me.
He Iooked depressed.
Ever since you girIs disappeared,
Daddy´s been. . .
. . . thinking about you nonstop.
I didn´t forget for a moment.
We shouIdn´t have come back.
Wait.
We ran down the halI,
opened the door violentIy.
I heard Dad sobblng behind me.
I crled.
I couldn´t stop.
You crying?
Let´s go back, OK?
Slurring my words, I trled to
convlnce her. She smmiled.
Let´s go back.
Yes, let´s go back.
Let´s do everything over.
Can you hear me, Yuka?
Can you hear my volce?
I crled with my face buried ln hls chest, Yuka.
I had never done anything like that.
I was mmoved.
Kummiko snuggled up to us and sobbed.
We reconciled.
Eat aI l you want.
Sorry it´s not much.
Next time l´ I I get more food.
A variety of dishes.
It´ I I be fun.
Your dad just won big on. . .
. . . bicycIe races.
Awesome, Dad.
Great.
Horse racing, pachinko. . .
LateIy l´ve been winning them aI l.
It´s I ike a miracle.
You´re so lucky.
So, with that money. . .
I want us to start over.
I won´t cause you any troubIe.
Your mother is
watching over us from heaven.
Just got kind of emotionaI, huh?
Let´s eat.
We have dessert too.
This is a littIe too sweet.
Time´s up.
WeI l. . . can we finish dinner?
Time´s up.
You´re right.
Time just flew by.
A littIe bit longer, Dad.
ReaI Iy?
Yeah, you just got back, so. . .
Don´t leave again.
Dad.
Don´t go. PIease stay.
Don´t get carried away, asshoIe.
RuIes are rules, you fuck.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Let´s get out of here.
Get up.
Get the fuck up.
Wanna stay here forever?
"Yuka? By now, you know what we do?"
"lt´s calIed ´family rental. ´ You know it?"
That. . . that was fun. Very fun.
"Kumiko, born ln a coln locker, has her 25th
birthday is coming up, and we´re wonderlng. . ."
". . . which family to celebrate with. "
1 year Iater
In Tokyo, l was waitlng for her.
Kummiko, a. k. a. Ueno Station 54.
I knew she´d be here.
Excuse me.
Kumiko, right?
I´d I ike to talk to you about something.
An ordinary girl.
If you have any questions about
our services, please cal I this number.
What?
I can´t expIain anything
to you in person.
You can´t run away from me.
"Your support. PersonneI pIacement.
We take aI l orders"
I´lI get you.
". . . 24 Dead. . . "
". . . Mass Suicide. . . "
They´re Iate.
Are they here?
Who?
That guy?
Him?
No.
Be cooI, be cooI, be cool. . .
They´re not here yet.
Mr. Shimabara?
Yes.
What do you wanna know?
What?
I wanna know the truth.
Be cooI, be cooI. . .
Are you connected to you, Tetsuzo?
What?
Are you connected to yourseIf?
Yes. That´s why I´m here.
I know al I about you.
Good for you.
I used to be a reporter.
Is this Suicide Club´s headquarters?
Suicide Club? No such thing.
There are theories of cults and mass hysteria,
of cuIt groups embracing messiahs. . .
. . . and the apocaIypse,
all linked to a Suicide CIub.
Suicide Club this, Suicide CIub that.
It´s even in the media.
Don´t pretend like you don´t know.
But it seems I ike they´ve forgotten
about that incident at Shinjuku.
54 peopIe died there.
But humans are forgetfuI creatures.
PeopIe forget everything.
There is no Suicide Club.
I t´s al l a product of your apathetic curiosity.

A circIe?
Anyway, imagine that the Sun Goddess
was born in a locker.
The coI lapse of civilization began
at the #54 Iocker at Ueno Station.
Ueno Station, Iocker #54.
She runs a fami Iy-rental business
caI led l. C. Corp.
"Three-Day-OId Coin Locker Baby Found"
She runs a fami Iy-rental business
caI led l. C. Corp.
"Three-Day-OId Coin Locker Baby Found"
When requested, they go spend time
with their clients. . .
. . . and pretend
to be their fami Iy members.
Sometimes for 10 years or 2O years.
What ls he saying?
What ls he talking about?
She has many companies, incIuding
several masquerading as car rentals.
Do you understand?
What about the Suicide Club?
What about it?
It´s the result of
Kumiko´s grudge, right?
What Kumiko wanted was. . .
. . . to live a normaI life
and be a normaI girl, right?
So she acted like a normaI girl
in fami Iy-rentaI situations.
But that wasn´t enough.
She wanted revenge.
She wanted to turn
every kid into Kumiko.
There´s nothing more to teI l you.
What?
I toId you everything.
Now, everyone else is starting to realize
what they have to do.
Don´t you know?
Be cooI, be cooI. . .
You tried so hard to figure us out.
I know al I about you.
But what do you know?
You used to be a reporter.
But it´s over and you can relax now.
I want my daughters back.
"Missing"
I want my daughters back.
I want my daughters back.
"Searching for Lost Puppies"
It´s time for you to wake up to your roIe.
Who are you?
You said you were connected
to yourself, but are you reaI Iy?
You´re not beI ievable
as a reporter or a father.
The worId is fuI I of I ies that peopIe
can´t pIay their roles convincingly.
They fai I as husbands, wives,
fathers, mothers, children, etc.
So, the only way to figure out
what we can be. . .
. . . is to lie openIy
and pursue emptiness.
FeeI the desert.
Experience loneliness. Feel it.
Survive the desert.
That is your roIe.
That night, l had a strange dream.
The desert.
Was this what he meant?
I was ln their hldeout.
Was this really their hideout?
I sensed Noriko and Yuka were here.
I knew they were aIive.
They were here.
I felt their presence profoundly.
Noriko. . . her volce. . .
Yuka. . . 5 years oId. . . runnlng into
the kitchen. . . holding the newspaper. . .
They were alive.
Why did Norlko run away from home
during a blackout in Iate 2001?
Tetsuzo, what´s your connectlon
to Toyokawa? To your fammiIy?
To yourself?
State lt in 50 words or Iess.
Yuka.
Noriko.
I heard that guy´s voice.
Suddenly I was back in the desert.
I had to go on and find themm.
I woke up.
TETSUZO
HeI lo?
Tetsu? lt´s me.
I´m aImost there.
What story are you working on?
I´Il tell you Iater.
OK. I´Il see you shortly.
What would l say to Yuka?
I wondered.
What was she thlnking whenshe wrote this story?
Even lf l was there, I couIdn´t be there for her.
She disappeared the next day. . .
It wasn´t just some kind of
hypothetical situation.
She was cIearly expressing anger at me.
ImmediateIy qultting my job as edltor-ln-chlef
the day after Yuka ran away...
I didn´t do that.
I went to work Iike nothlng happened,
samme as when Noriko disappeared
Is it OK I ike this?
That´s fine.
Now, about the new Toyokawa history corner...
The foIlowlng day, our top story was
about Toyokawa´s pubIic library.
It was 2 mmonths Iater
that l flnaIly quit my job.
Because my wife killed herself.
Can I take a picture?
I thought Yuka would be shocked.
I was an even worse father
than she had immaglned.
I chose my career over my family.
Would you I ike to take a look?. . .
I chose my career over my family.
Would you I ike to take a look?. . .
Would you I ike to take a look?. . .
I took prlde ln my work because this
newspaper was a symbol of peace.
I took prlde ln my work because this
newspaper was a symbol of peace.
In Toyokawa, The bIue sky, the ocean,
the harbor, farms and mountains. . .
It was the perfect town.
I wrote pastoral fluff pleces for the paper,
Iike an artlst sketching the blue sky.
We all llved ln this perfect town.
My daughters were resldents of Toyokawa.
Point at that thing.
Look at Daddy.
Let´s take a picture.
Picture time.
Come on, Noriko.
Right there.
Point at that thing.
Ready?
Impressive.
Come take a look at this.
Noriko, Yuka, come on.
Look.
A happy fami Iy.
When mmy wife dld a palnting
based on that photograph. . .
I falIed to notice
my daughters´expresslons.
Yuka wrote "All he understood was that
he didn´t understand them at aII. "
When l read that, l cried.
Fuck this.
A bunch of crap.
I had aII these notes
on the waIls of my room.
Fuck aI l this.
A month later. . .
My wife died.
She was tired.
Taeko.
I read the notes repeatedly.
Even though Yuka saw rlght through me. . .
Yuka could simmulate me, but l couIdn´t simulate
my daughter´s actions lnmy mlnd. . .
. . . or my wlfe´s.
Right here.
Here.
I´m so sorry.
It´s all my fault.
Had I been a good mother,
they wouldn´t have. . .
What?
Don´t say that.
It´s not your fault.
It´s all right.
Taeko.
What are you sti I I doing up?
Taeko?
Hey, Taeko?
Hey...
While I had my eyes averted from
the bIoody stench of reallty, ...
...my two daughters dlsappeared
from thls forced peaceful palnting.
Taeko!
CaIm down.
It´s all right.
No red baIloons.
I would´ve done anything to catch them if they´d
promlsed to take mme to my girls.
Tetsu.
How you been?
Hey. This way.
What´s the hurry?
Sit.
You know the Suicide CIub?
I started taIklng right away.
A summmary of my llfe in 30 sec.
This is my daughter. She ran away...
This is my daughter. She ran away...
I then explained why I was ln Tokyo.
I then handed him my notes,
and toId hlm. . .
. . . to flnish what l had started,
if something happened to me.
I don´t understand.
Things have changed.
After today,
I don´t know if l´ I I be safe.
You´re the onIy one l can trust
with this information.
What exactIy do you want me to do?
If you disappear, then what?
Suppose this Suicide CIub exists.
What am l supposed to do with it?
You´I l know what to do.
It´s right up your al Iey.
I´m gonna go now.
Wait here for a woman, Kumiko.
She´I l be here in a minute.
TeI l her you want a fami Iy.
This is the scenario
My daughters, Noriko and Yuka.
They´ I l play your daughters.
Kumiko wi I I pIay your wife, Taeko.
Noriko and Yuka will be cal Ied. . .
. . . Mitsuko and Yoko, respectiveIy.
Their favorite aliases.
Anyway, l have to go.
I´l I tel I you more Iater.
Yeah?
You caI led us?
Yes.
We appreciate your business.
Come on in.
Thanks.
Please sit.
So, let´s talk.
You want to be the father, correct?
Yes.
You want a wife and two daughters?
Yes.
Look through this photo album
and pick who you want.
I I ike this girI.
The oIder sister wi I l be Mitsuko.
The younger sister wi I I be Yoko.
And my wife. . .
Hey, Sis.
Sis?
Mitsuko doesn´t need to act right now.
No acting when you have no roIe.
I was embarrassed. l knew she
wasn´t my real sister anymmore.
I needed more practice.
You need more practice.
You´re Yoko.
She´s Mitsuko.
Not Yuka, not Noriko.
Not sisters.
Forget that.
Memorize this address.
Study the area.
Stores, banks, cigarette machines. . .
Know where everything is.
He wants to act like he´s been
in this town for 20 years.
So we have to act I ike
we´ve been here for 20 years.
He wants us to be
his fami Iy members.
I´m his wife.
You´re his daughters.
This time you´re sisters.
This guy is your father.
They stared at the photograph,
and then cIosed thelr eyes.
They lmagined being hls daughters.
I looked at the photo. . .
. . . dolng that made the father´s face
become flesh and bIood.
I look at the customer´s face.
Not to become hls wife.
But to make sure it wasn´t
the same guy from before.
That guy l met - Tetsuzo.
I knew for sure he was behlnd this.
Tetsuzo Shimabara.
Mitsuko.
Yes?
Do you still have the coat you were
wearing when you ran away?
Yeah.
You have it now?
Yeah.
Can I see it?
Sure.
I remember this.
Can you put it on?
Okay.
Can you imitate Noriko with this?
I want you to wear it today, Mitsuko.
Former slsters. . .
He´s not a regular cI ient.
Be careful.
They weren´t ready for this.
Oftentimmes, people came to us
to reIive thelr past.
Business card.
5 years ago, I met someone who
clalmed to be my reaI mother.
She begged for a chance to fix
our reIationship.
Sayuri Yoshida?
You´re a "fIower coordinator"?
What´s that?
You read my letter?
Yeah.
I read it, Mom.
I calIed her Mom.
Thank you.
Mom.
Once agaln.
Slowly.
Mom.
Mitsuko.
I don´t know that name.
You know how much I missed you?
I´m sorry, Mitsuko.
Who´s Mltsuko?
I aIways think about you.
Thank you, Mitsuko.
Where´s Dad?
We´re back together now.
And? You suck at acting.
You wanna switch?
What do you mean?
You want me to pIay the mother´s roIe?
Now you I isten to me.
If you want, l can play your mother,
you bitch.
A locker is my mother.
I told her a locker was my mother.
The woman cried and screamed,
but I didn´t give a shlt.
You´ re so cruel !
Even lf she was my reaI mmother,
she didn´t convlnce me at all.
I´ m cruel?
Yes, Iet´ s do a crueI role pIay!
Even lf she was my reaI mmother,
she didn´t convlnce me at all.
Even lf she was my reaI mmother,
she didn´t convlnce me at all.
Express more suffering.
Even lf she was my reaI mmother,
she didn´t convlnce me at all.
Express more suffering.
Just an amateur actress.
She couldn´t pIay it weIl.
So easy. Crying is the easiest form of acting.
She couldn´t pIay it weIl.
So easy. Crying is the easiest form of acting.
So easy. Crying is the easiest form of acting.
I thought about showing her
how to play the role properly.
I thought about showing her
how to play the role properly.
I want to start over.
WouId Tetsuzo say that too?
Practice with us.
I´l I do anything.
She says she´ll practice pIaying mother with us.
Sayuri.
I´Il do anything.
Take her.
Wait.
Bring aIong your man.
We´ll make him a "father. "
He´s here now.
Where?
Mitsuko.
Take him too.
Their daughter was
probably named Mltsuko.
Mitsuko. . .
A few years later,
a glrI named Mltsuko showed up.
If you do a good job tonight,
you´I l finaI Iy become the reaI you.
OK.
Mitsuko?
OK.
But remember, you´re not real sisters.
It´s all acting.
The guy will play your father.
Don´t let him confuse you.
OK?
"8:.29 PM"
"8:.29 PM"
I had aII the lights on.
I had aII the lights on.
I heard a car stop outslde.
It was a gamble.
They´re here.
What did l want?
To regalnmy pride and dignity?
No, l just wanted to show them
what l was capable of.
This was a party.
A surprlse party.
I grasped my wife´s knife
that l had in my pocket.
I suddenIy regretted my whole Iife.
For some reason as I felt that regret,
I also loved lt.
How was Hokkaido?
We´re home.
I had looked for a house
that resembIed my own.
This one´s very simi Iar.
You´re right.
- Can we go look at it now?
- Sure.
Thanks.
Here.
Great.
I think it meets your criteria.
Can we go inside?
Sure.
Be careful.
Put the cabinet in this room.
I transported everything.
Furniture, Noriko´s stuff, Yuka´s stuff. . .
Everything.
We´re home.
I´m exhausted.
WeIcome home.
Hi, Dad.
I´m so tired.
I missed you.
Noriko and Yuka carrled
their blg travel bags.
It was the flrst time in 2 years
that l saw my daughters.
My heart was beating.
All those repressed emotions welled up.
Mitsuko, Yoko. . .
Something wrong?
"How was Hokkaldo?"
Ikeda started a conversation.
I humored him.
Mitsuko, smlIing,
got up and went to hug hlm.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
It wasn´t the same without you.
Corny acting. Was this what their
IoneIy, desperate cIients wanted?
But I was lonely and desperate too.
I´ve prepared sukiyaki for you.
WonderfuI.
Oh, no.
What?
Taeko, come here.
What?
ProbIem?
What´s the matter?
I forgot to buy meat.
What was l thinking?
You´re just tired.
It´s all right.
I´l I go buy it.
But you just got back.
It´s OK. l´ I l be right back.
Get me 3 packs of Cherry Cigarettes, too.
OK.
I needed to buy time.
Cherry Clgarettes were hard to flnd.
Kummiko was gone.
I heard the door shut.
VegetabIes, shirataki noodles. . .
Ikeda went back to the roomm.
Put your bags in your room.
Sis?
Yeah?
Been a Iong day, huh?
Yeah.
Just like old times, isn´t it?
Come downstairs.
Hurry.
OK.
I didn´t have mmuch tlme.
I had to act efficientIy.
My daughters were smlIing.
They looked so lovely.
I had mmade up my past and stuffed it aII
in the back of a cold locker, in that metal box.
But in reallty it was a cardboard box.
Soft and fragile, it wouId dlssoIve in the raln.
An outIine...
Hummans have an outIine.
I wanted to make him a soIid father.
It wasn´t long ago that
Broken Dam was stabbed to death.
Phone for you.
How may l help you?
What?
He wants to kiI l me.
You´re gonna die?
Maybe. CouId you leave?
CheerfuIly, Broken Dam delivered
her final lecture.
CheerfuIly, Broken Dam delivered
her final lecture.
I took psychoIogy.
In cIass, a buI Iy and
his victim reversed roIes. . .
. . . and the bully feIt the victim´s
pain for the first time and wailed.
He what?
He wept.
- Sorry l´m late.
- Have a seat.
The buI ly Iearned his Iesson
and never bul I ied again.
So, someone has to pIay
the roIe of a victim.
Everyone wants to be champagne,
not the gIass. A fIower, not the vase.
But the world needs gIasses and vases.
These roles need to be filled.
Like a master/servant reIationship.
Maybe that´s how capitaI ism is?
- What´s capitaI ism?
- l´ I I teI I you Iater.
Lovers, spouses, fami Iy members. . .
We all need to reverse roles and. . .
. . . figure out what each of us
is meant to be.
SurvivaI of the fittest?
So cute.
We need rabbits.
Not just lions.
Rabbits and I ions can´t switch places,
but we human beings can.
Somme will kllI.
Somme will be klIIed.
That´s the circle of llfe,
though there are contradlctions.
Just Iike the numbers after 3.14 in pi continue
without end, real circles can never be perfect.
But if you draw a clrcIe wlth
a compass and a blg fat marker. . .
. . . a thick outI ine wiI l
make it seem perfect.
I´l I give you a sense
of perfection, Tetsuzo.
You can be a I ion.
I´l I be a rabbit.
I don´t need thick outI ines.
My metaI box is starting to rot.
I´m gonna go to a higher IeveI.
A rabbit, a suicide, a kil Ier, evi I,
water overfIowing from a gIass. .
I´Il be whatever no one else wants to be.
I´m sick of shameless outI ines of
peopIe seeking happiness.
They don´t wanna be rabbits.
They just wanna eat rabbits.
There´s no such jungle.
While our cIub expanded. . .
Broken Dam, CrippIe #5,
Long Neck, Midnight. . . they al I died.
Some killed themseIves.
Some were ki I Ied.
Broken Dam went to see a cllent who hated his
Wife ln a hoteI room. l went aIong.
Red carpet in the halI.
I´l I turn it on.
You know what song he requested?
- Some SMAP song?
- Wrong.
What?
Hint? Think, a geyser of blood.
What?
Blood won´t be noticeabIe here.
- l got it. "Wine-Red Heart" ?
- Wrong.
Just turn on the radio in 3O sec.
OK.
Why weren´t you with me that day?
I´m sorry, sweetheart.
- "Bright Red Sun" ?
- Wrong.
Forgive me.
Why did you go see him?
You fuckin´ Iove him?
I´m sorry l betrayed your trust.

I felt llke I was back in 2002,
standlng on that pIatform.
I tore off a thread that was
dangling from my coat.
54 girIs llned up on the pIatform
at Shinjuku.
Open a window. I needed somme air.
I walked past the stranger
to the veranda.
I opened the window.
The white curtalns bilIowed.
It was snowing.
SaIiva started to fIow ln my mouth.
It mlght have been drooI. Cold drooI.
I couldn´t breathe,
so I opened my mouth.
Drool drlpped on the floor.
The table, reflected in the window,
seemed so far away.
Guys from our clrcIe were beatlng up the
stranger, kicking and punching hlm.
I crouched down and
touched my own drool.
I was droollng,
and I wanted to pee.
Soon, everything turned white.
It felt Iike there was sand everywhere.
The fIoor seemed rough.
But I wasn´t ln the desert. l was in some
nammeless town. l was somme nameless glrl.
And I was talking to Tangerine.
Tangerine, Tangerine... Round, orange-colored
Tangerine was standing in the snow.
What´s up, Norippe?
Boys are troubIe. . .
I remembered that we used to
waIk to school together.
Recognize my uniform, Norippe?
That´s the school l go to now.
And this is my route there
It was a snowy nght,
and Tangerine was there.
I sti I l Iove tangerines.
Tangerines.
Yuka was crying.
Mitsuko. Yoko.
Mom.
I got some meat.
What happened?
You must be hungry.
Let´s eat.
Can you go get the portabIe stove
from the kitchen?
So coId today.
I know.
Can you cIose the window?
Also, can you go get the pan?
My hands are numb.
What?
It doesn´t work, Mom.
Where are extra gas cartridges?
He´ll find them.
- Don´t put it on the stove.
- Why not?
It´s out of gas.
I´l I put it here for now.
- l´m so hungry.
- Me too.
Do we have extra cartridges?
Sweetheart, you wanted us to die together tonight.
Didn´t you?
Please.
Kil I me.
Who´s this man?
He´s your father, sil Iy.
Noriko, your father´s looking for
gas cartridges.
Noriko?
Kil I me now.
Just kill me.
Then run away with Noriko and Yuka.
No, l´m not Noriko.
I´m Mitsuko.
Don´t make a face, Noriko.
No.
You´re a girl.
I´m not Noriko.
I´m Mitsuko.
GirIs shouIdn´t do that.
No.
Dear, don´t you agree?
Mom, l´m Mitsuko.
We wanna avoid pain.
We just wanna avoid pain, right?
You, me. . .
We just wanna avoid pain, right?
We all just wanna avoid pain.
It´s time to go, but. . .
Are we going?
Or staying?
What do you wanna do, sir?
I´m so tired.
Right, sir?
Sir?
Do you want more time?
I think. . .
Can I say what I think?
Is it OK, Mitsuko?
You aI l Iook like I ions to me.
You aI l Iook like I ions.
Let´s be rabbits again.
Let´s be rabbits again, OK?
I want to extend this session.
Let´s extend it.
Mm, this is good.
Ow, hot!
Home-cooked meals are the best.
You have to eat vegetables too.
Get me some meat, Mom.
- Get it yourseIf.
- You shouId get it, Sis.
I gave you vegetables, too.
- Want some meat, Dad?
- No, l´m fine.
It´s deI icious.
Tea?
RefiI l, pIease.

- Please.
Honey, excuse me. Oh, watch out!
There is no Suicide Club.
Warms you up, huh?
I know.
You can eat more, right?
My face is burning.
The worId is the Suicide CIub, with far
more suicides than our circIe.
Being cIose to death gives I iving vaIue.
OnIy a smaI I fraction of our
members actual Iy commit suicide.
Not aI l members commit suicide?
It was a stupid question.
OnIy the members whose roIes
require them to commit suicide, do.
If you saw a lion eat a zebra,
wouId you call it a "CannibaI CIub" ?
Lions eat zebras.
Zebras eat grass.
The circle of I ife.
- Are you eating vegetables?
- Yeah, l even had seconds.
But there´s still a lot.
´Cause you´re onIy eating meat Sis.
Sorry.
I want. . .
I want to start over.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.
Taeko.
I want to redo everything. Starting now.
But. . .
Don´t you know. . .
We´re aI I sick and tired of
your seIfish ways.
Dad. . .
You´ve always been so selfish.
Noriko.
She had never said anything
Iike that to me in Toyokawa.
If she had, l probably would´ve hit her.
I´m so sorry.
I was wrong.
So Iet´s. . .
. . . make a fresh start.
Let´s die once. . .
. . . and come back to I ife.
I´m done.
It was delicious.
- l´m fuI l.
- Me too.
We finished it al I.
3 hours had passed.
The extension on mmy time was about over.
I was happy.
I wanted to shout, "Happy!"
My dad. . . my slster. . .
. . . and Kumiko as mmy mmother.
Happy!
I remlnisced about. . .
Toyokawa, 10 years ago. . .
. . . the stuffed anlmaI attached to
my sister´s bag. . .
. . . memories. . . ln rapid succession. . .
After dlnner, my slster and l
took a bath together.
Sis.
Do you remember when Dad came to class?. . .
...when he was discovered by the other kids?
We taIked about our past. . .
when we were Noriko and Yuka.
Yeah, I remember.
Dad was so embarrassed.
I couldn ´t telI lf this woman was
Mitsuko or Noriko,but she was Iaughing wlth joy.
You must be tired.
You must be too.
Mom, Dad.
Good night.
I wanted the power to go out
before we went to sleep.
But the whole house remained
bright wlth fIuorescent Iights.
I´m a I ittIe dizzy from the heat.
Gotta get up early tomorrow, right?
- Gotta get some sleep.
- Me too.
G´night.
Good night.
I wanted to thank mmy father
for settlng this up.
That night, l thought l couId
finalIy take over from my sister.
She had aIways said. . .
"Gotta go sommewhere different.
Gotta get out of here. "
I had laughed at her.
But I finally understood her.
I watched her sIeep
for the first time ln a long time.
She was moanng ln her sleep.
Sounded famillar.
I was happy.
I wanted to teIl her,
"Never stop actlng, even in your sleep. "
I´m sorry, Sis.
Then l quletIy got out of bed.
Tiptoed down the halI.
Sommething l wanted to see.
Grinding his teeth. . .
taIklng in hls sleep. . . as usuaI.
Thank you, Dad.
While I was putting on mmy shoes,
I aImost sneezed.
I held it in.
I opened the door and went outside.
Fresh alr greeted me.
6 AM. lt was still dark.
I took a deep breath.
I lnhaIed deepIy.
I started to waIk down the street
toward the center of the clty.
I wanted to go somewhere
commpleteIy dlfferent.
I sneezed.
I´m waIking for the first time.
I was through with Yoko.
But I wasn´t Yuka elther.
Just some nameIess glrI.
I started waIklng.
Your heart is a smaII gIass.
If you pour too much emotion lnto it. . .
. . . tears will splII out.
Goodbye, Yuka.
Goodbye, my adolescence.
Goodbye, Halkyo. com.
Goodbye, Mltsuko.
I am Norlko.
