- Okay, up.
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
We're doing our job, Mrs. Ayperi.
Just because it says "Golden Record",
it doesn't mean that it's golden.
What kind of a sequestrator are you?
A junk dealer would pay
no more than 10 liras for this.
I know. I was just curious.
I'm a big fan of yours.
Here, you should take this.
It's an antique.
You can't find it anywhere else.
It pops cigarettes from the butt.
Who are you?
How are we going to learn who you are
if you act like this?
I had an older sister.
Her name was Hanife.
And we had a house,
but I can't find it.
How are we going to communicate? Does
your sister Hanife have a phone number?
Engin! Where are you? You were supposed
to buy bread! What took you so long?
Get in!
Whore.
Thank you.
Why are you here?
It's my home,
I can come if I want to.
Keep dreaming!
Did it take you 40 years
to remember that you had a home?
Why did you let me in then?
I didn't want to be embarrassed
in front of all those people.
We've already been living in shame
for all these years. Thanks to you.
I'll sell the house anyway.
Look at you!
You look like a whore in that outfit.
You are disgusting.
- Didn't you miss me at all, nurse?
- Hell, no!
Why would I miss you?
I'd rather miss Resul's mangy mule.
You're on fire! Yet, our photograph
was right there, on your dresser.
- To spit on your face every day.
- If you say so.
Sister? I didn't have breakfast.
Fine.
I have some crap, go eat that!
- And don't call me "sister".
- What should I call you?
Get out. Go back to where you came from.
Parasite.
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for, poor dog?
Tarhana.
We used to make it for breakfast.
She was going to come back.
You knew it like the back of my hand.
What made you grind your teeth,
what kept you up at night...
...was the rage you held inside.
Why do you feel so na√Øve now?
Why are you being clumsy?
Don't cool the fire in your heart.
Remember.
Remember what she did to you.
Remember, just like all those prayers
you know by heart.
Don't cool down, my heart.
Don't cool down. Burn.
Burn like the very first day.
Burn like fire and brimstone.
- It hurt this time, Hanife!
- Thank you, Mrs. Hanife.
I said it hurt.
What are you thanking her for?
Shut it! We're trying to talk!
You call the doctor.
She's doing this on purpose.
Mrs. Hanife? Here you are.
- So, Lady Ayperi is here, I heard.
- What "lady"?
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.
You were never good at this anyway.
Mom always used to say:
"Don't you ever peel anything
because the entire thing goes to waste.
Leave it to your sister."
Get out!
Come, take care of the laundry!
Do some housework!
Where are you going this time?
Neck-slapping day!
- Osman, you're coming, right?
- Yeah, I am.
What's up, girl?
Dude!
Erkut, pass.
Erkut, pass! Pass, man!
Stop, stop!
What the hell?
Don't be selfish!
The moron thinks he's Pele!
Go, Hatice!
Wonderful!
Come on! Come on!
Come on, dude!
The first half is over!
Five minute break!
Okay.
Learn to pass the ball!
Girl, look at him.
He's staring at you.
Who is he?
He's the son of the district governor.
They've recently relocated here.
He looks just like Ayhan Isik.
I learned all about him.
After high school,
he couldn't make anything of himself.
He lived in Istanbul for a while.
He seems kinda badass.
I love that.
- He's like Belmondo, girl!
- Shut up!
He even speaks English.
His name is Tarik.
He's looking at you again.
Show him your smile.
He's really not my type.
Who is your type? These losers?
Why are you hitting me?
The heart wants what the heart wants.
So true...
Who knows why his heart wants you.
He plays the guitar!
Yeah...
Just like Elvis Presley...
Second half!
Go play ball with the boys.
You should feel sorry for yourself.
Idiot.
Pass the ball! Pass!
Pass the damn ball, you wuss!
Dude, who's that poser?
Hatice!
Hurry, come home.
Dad's calling for you.
What? For God's sake!
He will give you hell.
I hope your dad won't give you hell.
I'm sure this viper ratted you out.
Shut up! Cake face!
Maybe I should come with you.
We should all tell the same story.
"We didn't play ball.
We sat in the shade and knitted lace."
- We can say that.
- Do I have any lace with me? Idiot!
You are the best sister ever!
Come on, run! Run!
Are you trying to make
a murderer out of me?
Stop getting on my nerves,
or else, I'll beat the crap out of you!
Keep your daughters in line!
Hanife didn't do anything wrong.
It's all that little pig's fault.
People must have gossiped
about you playing football.
At least, they could have told him
that I scored three goals.
What are you doing?
It'll unravel!
Laugh while you can. Who's going to
save you when I get married?
At least you should learn this stuff.
I don't need to
because I won't get married.
You'll get stuck with us forever,
is that it?
- Sister! Is "Hayat" magazine out?
- Yes.
- Did you buy it?
- Well, I don't know...
- Hey! Sister!
- Stop! Stop!
Please, let me read it! Please!
Come on, let's read it! Please!
Alright, fine!
We'll read it together tonight!
- I don't like reading it by myself.
- Okay, okay.
Who's on the cover this week?
Filiz Akin!
Girl, you stink!
Go take a shower!
I'll rub your back,
but under one condition.
- What?
- You'll do impressions as we read.
Fine, I'll do it.
Girl! Come, eat something.
I'll start cleaning up the table.
You're still here?
And you're eating my food.
Like a rat.
Thief.
Is it a lie? No.
Is it a lie? No.
She put you in a grave and left.
Now, it's time to resurrect.
Now, it's time for revenge.
She's an enemy from your own family.
The one who hurts the most.
Is it a lie? No.
Is it a lie? No.
Tonight at the Saray Theatre:
"Vesikali Yarim".
Thanks.
The best movie of the year.
Starring Turkan Soray.
Tonight at the Saray Theatre:
"Vesikali Yarim".
The best movie of the year.
Hey there. You're...
Wait a minute. I'll be right down.
Hello.
You're that girl I saw yesterday, right?
I'm waiting for a friend.
- Alright. A girl or a boy?
- A girl, of course!
- Okay, relax.
- I'm not waiting for a boy.
I get that.
You have a sister, right?
Yes, but she's
only one year younger than me.
I graduated from
medical high school last year.
Why are you asking about Hatice?
She plays football,
I was intrigued.
That's because she's crazy. Mental.
And she says she'll never get married.
Fine, then I'll marry you.
Jerk!
Why did you come this early?
I told you that we were going to
take inventory at the health center.
I know, that's why I asked.
We did it, and it's done now!
"My Poetry Notebook"
"A Single Past, A Thousand Memories"
Get up, it's almost evening!
What do you think this is, a hotel?
My accountant ripped me off.
I lost the house.
The doctor said
I have early-stage Alzheimer's.
He prescribed me some drugs.
He said that I shouldn't be alone.
I should either be admitted
to a hospital, or someone should...
Go ahead, keep telling me about it!
As if I don't know what's what!
Who am I? - My older sister.
That's not what I meant!
Girl, I'm a medic.
I give injections. I'm a nurse.
Don't go telling me about illness.
I've seen thousands of illnesses
in my life.
The doctor said that I would forget
everything with each passing day.
That's why. I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
I never forget.
Look at yourself!
You're like a stray dog!
You're a star.
You don't need that bitch's leftovers!
Go away!
Sister, leave me alone. Enough.
Enough. - Girl, stop.
Today is the first day of school.
You shouldn't get in trouble
with your teachers.
Why the braid now?
Look how beautiful you are.
There's something
going on with you today.
What is it? Did the Kerime Nadir novel
have a happy ending?
- No way. Not even close.
- Then what is it?
Did you write a new poem, Miss Poet?
Mind your own business.
Eat your food.
Good morning, dad.
Thank you.
When did we become friends?
When did we become enemies?
You'll be the one to forget,
I'll be the one to remember.
When, in fact, it would only be fair
if it were the other way around.
Yes, sophomores. This way.
Seniors, form a single line
for your photo shoot.
Hurry up, kids!
Don't talk! Quiet!
Hurry, hurry. This way.
Yes. Quiet. Don't talk. Hurry.
That boy we saw yesterday is here.
Come here, come.
Stop acting like an idiot.
Behave yourself.
- Welcome.
- Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was recently appointed here,
I'm sure you know.
- Of course.
We would like to
discuss something with you.
Okay, right away. Let's go.
This way.
Bravo!
This is the first time
I see someone applauding themselves.
- But I was applauding you.
- You sang, you listened.
I'm sorry, but you have an amazing
voice. I just felt like singing along.
Merci.
But you have to find your own voice.
Don't sing like other people.
Have you ever wanted to be a singer?
I think you should.
- Find someone else to tease!
- I'm not teasing. I'm serious.
Okay, fine. Mrs. Ayten's studio
is just around the corner.
I'll record an album there.
It's empty anyways.
She's like a sister to my mother,
she'll give me a discount.
- Don't you have any dreams?
- My dreams are none of your business!
Okay, why are you yelling at me?
What have I done?
- I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.
- Why did you skip class?
- It's a one-time thing, I'll be fine.
Why are you at school?
My father asked me to.
He spoke to the headmaster.
I'll arrange
social activities at school...
...and I'll be giving music lessons
on the weekend.
So that I won't get bored.
He's afraid
that I'll go back to Istanbul.
He needs a reason to keep you...
I wouldn't stay. - Should I go?
No, that's not what I mean.
I mean, If I were you... If...
See? You do have dreams.
You can deny it all you want.
Music is my dream.
- I wish you could hear the songs I wrote.
- You write songs? No way!
Why?
Don't you think I'm capable?
No, it's just... I don't know...
It seems to me like
that's something that...
...only important people can do.
People like me and you...
I don't know, we just can't.
I didn't mean that. Forgive me.
I have one condition:
You will listen to my songs right now.
- What the hell are we doing?
- Get in.
Are you crazy?
This isn't Istanbul!
If anyone sees us, my father would...
Forgive me.
Listen, let's make a deal.
You won't apologize to me ever again.
This is pure silk!
Just like you.
- Whose scarf is this?
- My mother's.
Right. It's a roadster.
Your hair blows in the wind.
There you go.
I think it's wonderful.
I can see it in your eyes.
This is our destiny.
The music will never stop in our lives.
No lyrics?
No. I can't write any lyrics.
I tried many times, but I can't.
It just doesn't work.
- I can write some, if you like.
- Really?
Play it a couple more times.
Let me familiarize myself with the tune.
For my weeping eyes, for my weary heart,
I found a cure, my dear.
Again.
For my dried lips, for my empty glass,
I need a new love in my life.
Now!
A couple of letters and some dry roses,
Are all I have left of you.
Excellent.
Your voice is just like Ayten Alpman's.
It's time now, I can no longer take it,
You're nothing but an old friend to me.
Easy, children.
Is this your song, Mr. Tarik?
Yes, madam. I composed the music,
Hatice wrote the lyrics.
- And your last name?
- 165, Hatice Yesilyurt.
Perfect.
Kids, why didn't you tell me
that you were doing a project like this?
Mr. Tarik? - Yes?
If you'd like to put together
a school band...
...you can use the school's resources
if you wish.
And Hatice will be the lead singer.
She might make us proud
in the high school singing competition.
Sure, madam.
But the thing is, the music teacher
doesn't like me at all.
I'll take care of that.
And you?
101, Mediha Gurcesme.
I'm a fan. I just listen.
Perfect.
Madam, the medics are here.
They said we'll be getting injections.
We should all...
We should all gather
in the cafeteria...
She says it doesn't hurt.
- Will your sister do it?
- No, she won't.
They say she's tough.
You're not scared of needles, are you?
What are you doing here?
You should have waited outside.
I came to make sure
you're not scared.
But I'm not scared. I'm not.
Everyone's looking at us.
Please leave. There will be rumors.
- That's my sister over there.
- I have a hard time believing that.
- She's so annoying.
- And she always stinks of sweat.
What did you just say?
At least she's not a whore
like you two.
I'll show you once we get out of here.
What's going on over there?
Mind your own business.
Sir,
I haven't been vaccinated for tetanus.
I need to be vaccinated.
But I want the lady to do it.
Is it possible?
Miss Hanife is just a novice.
She's not ready yet.
- It's not possible.
- I think it is.
If we don't give young people...
...the opportunity to advance
in their careers...
...we cannot become
a modern society.
Bravo.
Bravo.
I trust this lady.
Hanife, will you be able to do it?
Good morning. I'll bring tea.
Nice blouse.
For sluts.
Do you remember this girl?
This one. - Of course I do.
What was her name?
I liked her a lot.
Really, you liked someone?
What a surprise!
Is she around?
What happened to her?
Her name was Mediha.
It was her and her lousy family.
She died.
She was hit by a car,
and she died.
God damn you!
Oh, dear God! Oh, God!
Are you going to burn down the house?
You left the stove on!
Who the hell is this?
Are you trying to kill me?
I'm coming!
What happened, Mrs. Hanife?
You're furious again.
That's none of your business!
You might as well go ahead and slap me.
Is this the proper way
to treat your guest?
I'm heading over to your mom's
to give her an injection. What's up?
I fried some spring rolls.
We'll wash them down with some tea.
Hello, madam.
Hello. - Hello.
Mrs. Ayperi,
I'm so excited to see you.
You've probably heard this a thousand
times, but I grew up with your songs.
I'm Hande. Hello again.
I got up early
and fried spring rolls for you.
Mrs. Hanife loves my spring rolls.
Don't lie. I've never even tasted
your spring rolls.
This woman is hilarious!
I don't want to sound lame...
...but to get your autograph
would mean the world to me.
And the lyrics that you wrote
at the beginning of your career...
Oh, God!
After that, no better lyrics
were written for any of your songs.
Oh, you're touched. I'm sorry.
I'm heading over to your mom's
to give her an injection. Will you stay?
Fine.
Keep an eye on her,
don't let her burn the house down.
Lady Ayperi?
Now that you have a paper and pen,
you can write some poems too.
Your sister is very rude.
Right behind the high trees,
in a deep fog, you stand.
You remain unseen,
but you see it all.
You're the keeper of a land
that no one knows.
They call it "the witch's forest",
and they are scared of it.
They cannot bear to go near it.
Oh, God! They're an army of cowards
at the edge of that forest.
Andy Warhol is right. One day,
everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.
And I'm famous in social media.
Photography is my passion.
I even took classes.
I have 8753 followers on lnstagram.
This place is great for
taking photographs. Houses, people...
I'm getting many likes.
Look, I also found this.
My mom kept it.
You loved each other very much, right?
A couple of letters and some dry roses,
Are all I have left of you.
It's time now, I can no longer take it,
You're nothing but an old friend to me.
Sadness, tears, and a broken heart,
Are all I have left of you.
When you sing, you forget about me.
I wanted to remind you that I'm here.
Are you angry?
No, I'm worried.
- Why?
- Because I could have bad breath.
If I knew,
I would have chewed a mint or something.
You smell like a fairy.
Have you ever smelled a fairy before?
I don't know.
Maybe in my dreams.
Fairy-scented girl.
- What happened? Why did you run away?
- My father will find out soon.
He won't let me sing. - No way!
It's not the dark ages!
Don't you see the world?
The hippies, the sexual revolution...
- The world is a different place now.
- That's the world.
But here...
It's the way it is.
We can talk to him.
We'll ask the principle for help,
if necessary.
Our families would meet. - No.
- Why? Is your father very strict?
- Tarik, don't!
You're giving me hope.
About you and your...
You know, those songs...
Seeing that band like that,
seeing you...
I...
What would I do
if it doesn't work out?
I'd be devastated.
I don't know about the songs.
They may betray you one day, but I...
I will never do that.
Just don't give up on me.
Don't you give up on me.
We can do anything
as long as we're together.
I promise.
Fairy girl...
Don't you give up on me.
Tomorrow, we'll practice something else:
Bossa Nova.
Great, sir.
Actually,
I had a music book about Bossa Nova.
- Okay, guys, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Goodbye, sir, have a good day.
- Hanife?
- Hi. I was going to...
Hi. Hanife, right?
It's just between you and me...
Don't ever tell your sister, okay?
What's your father like?
Is he very strict? Very angry?
No. He's fine, I mean...
He's a normal guy.
He's a dad. He loves us.
Okay.
He's a reasonable man then, right?
Yeah, sure.
Sure, he's reasonable.
Alright.
- Okay.
- Okay.
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.
No, sure.
It's okay. Of course you'll ask.
- Okay, see you.
- Okay.
Mrs. Hanife,
we were coming to visit you.
Don't you see, I'm not home!
Since when do you come to visit me?
Get the hell out of here! Go!
I told them to leave, but they wouldn't.
I bolted the door.
Shameless people!
They think this is a circus.
Get out of here!
Who does she think she is?
Mrs. Hanife?
She was really quiet for a while.
Then, it seemed like she was
talking to someone.
I got a little scared.
May God take all our lives,
and then, we can be free of all this.
Don't say that!
Okay, I'm leaving.
- I'll stop by later to pick up the plate.
- Fine. Thank you.
You're welcome. See you.
They won't leave me alone
since you got here.
Memories on one hand,
people on the other.
I always held my head up high.
I don't owe anyone anything.
Then you came along.
You turned everything
upside down again.
What am I going to do with you?
What am I going to do with you?
The devil says "kick her out".
But how am I supposed to
kick you out?
Even your name is a lie.
"Hatice and the Martians"
Just "The Martians" would be enough.
But the choice is yours.
Madam, Hatice is our lead singer.
She means a lot to us.
You were going to write
a letter to her family, for permission.
Okay, okay.
Come to my room,
and I'll sign it right away.
"We would love to welcome you
to our social activities.
School Headmaster Sabiha Soykan."
Go ask your dad now. I'll be waiting
for your good news by the barn.
What if your mom shows up?
I told you, they're at the club.
They won't be back before 8pm.
Stop worrying about little things.
Think big. Imagine.
There's nothing left to keep us
from making the music we want to make.
We can be just like these guys.
Look...
He was the son of a truck driver.
When he was a child,
they lived in poverty.
But he believed.
Believe in yourself and your music.
What do they have that we don't?
This town isn't big enough
for either of us. It won't be enough.
You know it too.
You want it too.
Fairy girl...
One day, your voice will be heard
all over Turkey.
Tarik... Tarik, don't.
Tarik, don't.
Tarik! Are you home?
We were rehearsing.
- Hello, madam.
- Hi.
My family is waiting for me.
I should go.
No, stop.
I'll walk our beautiful guest out.
Thank you.
You're a pretty girl.
Don't ever step foot inside this house
again. Otherwise, it'll be a scandal.
What's your name?
Hatice...
...madam.
Damn slut!
You will see! You will all see!
You all!
You will all see! You will see!
Are you talking back to me? Huh?
Are you talking back to me?
How dare you? How dare you?
What song? What song?
I work day and night
to provide for your education!
Tell that teacher of yours...
...we send you to school
for an education and nothing else!
Listen to me.
Don't you dare push my buttons.
I'll kill you all!
Hatice, are you crazy?
Do you want him to kill you?
What song are you talking about?
Where are you going?
Follow her!
Hatice! Hatice, stop!
Stop running!
Hatice!
Hatice!
Stop.
- How dare you?
- Stop it!
Did my father just come home?
Enough! Shut up already!
Shut up! God damn you both!
- Sister...
- Shut up! Shut up!
It's always your voice!
It's always your voice! Shut up!
Why didn't you sing
our national anthem, girl?
Because I don't feel free, sir!
Hands forward!
Let's run away.
You're right.
Hello? Erhan? Hi.
Things got a little complicated here.
We are coming to Istanbul.
Okay, got it.
They left the car in Bursa.
Somewhere near the bus station.
Either they got on a bus
or a friend picked them up.
Can we stop the buses?
If they went to Istanbul like you said,
they must have reached there by now.
We gave out their descriptions.
We are looking for them.
- Hopefully, we'll find them, sir.
- I hope so too.
This is all your daughter's fault!
She seduced Tarik!
- My son never rebelled like this before!
- Okay, enough.
Oh, what happened to us?
Come here.
Husnu! Husnu!
Good morning. We're here.
We're here, madam. Good morning.
Don't worry.
- This place hasn't changed at all.
- You missed it, right?
Look, the house is right over there.
You're hungry, right?
We'll have a nice breakfast.
Erhan is a good person.
Besides, no one can find us here.
- Don't you be afraid.
- Why would I be afraid when I have you?
Lots of singing competitions
are being held nowadays.
We go and play too.
But you should hear it, there are
amazing voices every now and then.
We can try to participate
in one of those.
But the industry
doesn't care for composers.
They look mostly for arrangements.
They find successful foreign songs
and write Turkish lyrics for them.
Nobody wants to take risks.
The industry is dominated by
a couple of douchebags.
Tarik, as you well know, last year,
we struggled a lot in the industry.
But now, we have a fresh voice.
Come on, Hatice, bring us luck.
But Hatice won't be of age
until next year. It's okay, right?
As long as a producer has our back,
everything will get sorted out.
Once we become stars, we'll be safe.
No one will be able to harm us.
But we have a lot of work to do.
We'll knock on every door.
We'll pull some strings.
We'll think of something.
Come on, be positive. Come on.
Many hands... - Make light work!
Exactly.
Come on.
I rehearsed a lot!
He didn't even listen to me!
Mom, it's just... Mom! I'm just calling
so that you don't get worried.
Don't worry, I'm okay.
We're okay.
You won't find us. Even if you do,
I won't come back. Leave me alone.
Tell us, where are you?
I'll come and pick you up!
I know, you work hard.
But we don't have any other choice.
We should save money.
If nobody helps us, we will make
our first long play by ourselves.
First, a hit single.
Then, our first long play.
Think about it.
I'm happy. Stop asking, Tarik.
I won't give up.
I won't be exhausted.
I won't complain about anything
as long as I have you.
Thank you, fairy girl.
Crispy bagels! Here you are!
Bagels! Bagels!
Crispy bagels! Bagels!
Hey, man! Could you sell those
somewhere over there?
What are you talking about, man?
Dude, we're recording.
Move over.
Hey! Move it, pal!
What's with all the noise?
I've had enough! Enough!
How can you drink this?
We made it in the house,
but the recording turned out great.
Imagine it being made in a studio.
If we could only get some airtime
on the radio...
What was that producer's name again?
Kemal Tasciyan. I couldn't even
make an appointment with the man.
It's impossible
to set foot in his office.
People line up in front of his door.
You can't get past the guards.
Alright,
but doesn't he ever leave his office?
Every Saturday night,
he goes to the Saint Remo Pub.
He dines with his buddies
from the industry.
We need decent clothes.
Take out all the money
you have left on you, gentlemen.
- "I don't take orders from you".
- As you wish, right?
So, I said, "then don't".
- Come on, go ahead.
- Okay, tell Tarik.
Tarik, come on.
Good evening.
Me and my friend Erhan,
we're musicians.
And we have a great singer.
We make pop music...
It's not called pop music, kiddo.
It's called an arrangement.
Pop music is a term
that foreigners use.
You should first learn about
the genre of the music you make.
But we're not making arrangements, sir.
I write the music,
that lady over there writes the lyrics.
Oh, ambitious young people...
Wouldn't you agree that...
...westerners already make that music
in the best way possible?
So, are you preaching to the choir?
No, sir, you misunderstood us.
We are the choir.
We produce the songs.
Look, sir, I saw you in a magazine.
I know who you are. Nice to meet you.
You may write Turkish lyrics to foreign
songs and call it an "arrangement".
But as far as I know,
arrangements are for flowers.
We make our own music.
Of course, I understand your fear.
What will bigots like you do
if young people like us get a shot?
We'll steal the bread out of your mouth!
Right?
We are not copycats like you!
And this is our sweat and blood!
Mr. Kemal, please listen to our music.
Alright, young lady.
I will listen to it. When I get home.
You know what, I don't think you will.
I think you'll put it away
and forget about it.
Or Mister Florist here
will tear apart our tape.
Listen to it now.
Right here, right now.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Can I have your attention
for a minute?
Could you please listen to me
for just one minute?
Could you please listen to me?
We recorded two songs.
We put our sweat, blood and tears
into it. We gave our all.
If you'd like to listen to our songs
right now...
...could you please raise your hands?
Come here, guys.
Take a seat. Sit down.
Bagels!
An excellent idea.
It's perfect that you included
the unique sounds of Istanbul.
Yes! We did it!
Istanbul is going to hear our voice!
Come here!
We did it!
"Recording"
Guys, let's include the sounds of
Istanbul in a couple of songs...
...like in that first song
you pitched to me.
Kemal, maybe we can do
some of the songs with a rock sound.
What rock?
You're at the bottom of the ladder.
Forget about rock.
A drink on the rocks would suffice.
Guys, you should invest in
what's popular right now.
We'll follow the money.
We don't want any adventures.
Now... The name "Hatice" won't work.
We need to find you a stage name.
Peri.
Ayperi.
Ayperi...
You'd be mononymous. Nice.
You are listening to Turkish pop music
by Ayperi:
"One Past, A Thousand Memories".
"Artists of the Year"
"I Clawed My Way to the Top"
"An Outstanding Show by Ayperi"
Please don't talk like that, Fuat.
No matter how hard it gets,
I will forget you.
Stop! Stop! You should turn
to the camera for that last line.
The guy's right in front of me!
Why should I turn away?
Am I crazy? - Ah! Again!
Oh, God!
Whatever you want. Okay.
Please don't talk like that, Fuat.
No matter how hard it gets,
I will forget you.
Last couple of shots.
- Can we have a single shot of Ayperi?
- Sure, go ahead.
- Miss Ayperi, please look here.
- A little to the right.
- Miss Ayperi, over here.
- Yes, this way, please.
Face this camera, please.
Very good. Thank you so much.
Sorry, I'm late.
Hello, Kemal.
Welcome.
Sweetheart.
- I thought we'd meet alone.
- Ayperi is family. Relax.
I believe we have settled this matter.
The kids are happy.
They are famous. They are making money.
They are doing the job
they want to do.
And they're both of age.
I'm sorry to say this, but that means
you can't take any legal action either.
Don't worry, I have kids too.
I can perfectly understand your fears.
I'm not just their boss,
I'm also their brother.
Don't worry about anything.
And we're getting married soon.
- You will marry her?
- You should mind your own business.
I want my red roadster
as a wedding gift.
We want it.
And Kemal, your gift can be
that rock album you promised.
Excellent!
Maybe we'll move one day.
Don't think that
we'll live here forever.
No.
This should be our first and last house.
I think there is a song
hidden somewhere in this house.
I will answer all of your questions.
There's a time for everything.
Thank you so much.
Ayten, I need to send a telegram.
Can you help?
Of course, Miss Ayperi.
"I'm getting married next week.
Please come to my wedding.
Let's end this meaningless fight."
"Her Dad Passed Away,
Ayperi Tied the Knot Anyway"
"Big Scandal!"
They never told me.
I never knew. How did they...
How did they find out
even before I did?
I can't make the music I want.
At least, let me drink what I want.
Tarik, it's only 3pm. You've already
finished a bottle. Enough.
Leave me alone!
We're public property, remember?
Only the public can criticize us.
- We do whatever the public wants.
- Tarik, enough!
The girl's father died,
and you're talking nonsense!
Give me that!
We should organize charity concerts
to repair your image.
We'll start a series of concerts
immediately.
For the benefit of nursing homes
and the Child Protection Agency.
"Ayperi, The Guardian of Orphans"
"The Philanthropist Singer"
"Fairy Godmother Ayperi"
"The Golden Record Goes to Ayperi"
"Ayperi Wins the Golden Record"
There's this orchestra,
playing "La Cumparsita".
It's a country wedding,
for God's sake?
Guys...
Guys! Guys!
We have a recording session
at 8 in the morning. Remember?
I couldn't sleep a wink
because of your noise.
Am I supposed to sing out of my ass?
Come on. Everybody out!
Come on.
I see you called Mr. Erhan.
To keep us in line.
I could handle you on my own,
but you are all drunk as hell.
I thought maybe if there are two of us,
we'd get noticed.
Come on, guys.
Come on, leave. Go!
What the hell are you doing?
What is this? Go! Go!
Are you kidding me?
Babe... Look, my fairy girl.
I don't want you to treat me like this
when my friends are around.
What friends?
They're just a bunch of morons.
I haven't seen any one of you sober
in a month. Not even once.
You're floating like dead fish.
You have one true friend, Tarik,
and that is Erhan.
I'm getting jealous now.
Do you have a thing for him?
- Nonsense!
- Watch your mouth!
Just wait and see.
Tomorrow, I'll talk to Kemal.
I'll have those jerks fired.
The backup singers as well.
They sound like donkeys anyway.
What are you laughing at?
- What are you laughing at?
- Your jokes are hilarious.
Mr. Erhan, what would you like to drink
while watching our cute family fight?
What do you want, Tarik?
What is it that you can't handle?
Tell me.
A lecture on decency
from the both of you...
Maybe I can only be creative
when I drink. How would you know?
How about that!
The drunk music genius.
I'm okay with the real deal,
but it doesn't fit you.
You'll only be a cheap replica,
I'm telling you.
Oh, give me a break! You should
worry about your own lack of talent.
Can you write songs? - Enough!
Look at me, Tarik!
I burnt my bridges and came here!
I left more or less of a family behind.
Yes, we made some money,
yes, we became famous...
...but I won't tolerate
this kind of attitude.
Man up. Pull yourself together.
I clawed my way to the top.
"I clawed my way to the top."
Relax, honey,
you are not giving an interview.
Don't give me the lines
that Kemal had you memorize.
"Me, me, me!"
It's always about you! Always!
It's all your success, right?
I didn't even exist.
"Ayperi here, Ayperi there,
Ayperi my ass!"
I never even existed.
Damn it, I created you!
I even gave you your name.
And what are you?
Do you think I didn't see that notebook?
You're a thief,
who stole her sister's poems!
Enough!
You stole not only my poems,
but my life as well.
All you left behind was sickness.
Dad became paralyzed.
Mom died ahead of her time.
I had to deal with all their problems.
I carried them on my shoulders
for years. All because of you!
Now, you think I'll be happy to see you
and give you a hug?
How can I forget the past?
You forgot to mention Tarik.
I stole him too.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Tarik.
He didn't love you. He loved me.
That is also my fault.
There were no other man left on earth.
You became a recluse.
What a pity, that is also my fault.
What a pity... We should all pity you.
You had to put up with
all of the world's problems.
You know why?
Because you asked for it.
You didn't have the guts to step
outside that door and live your life.
You chose to die, sister.
On the day you were born.
Remember how people
looked at you with pity?
Deep inside, you felt satisfied.
As if you were mentally ill.
You played the drama queen
ever since you were a child.
And you were a great actress too!
It seems you're still playing
that same old role.
Yeah.
I stole the poems.
Call it foolishness, childishness,
call it whatever you want.
But if I didn't steal them,
they'd rot in that drawer. Like you.
My father died because of you,
not because of me.
Look at me.
Watch your mouth, or else...
Sit your ass down! Shut up!
I am talking now!
Dad didn't die
because he was upset with me...
...he died worrying about
what other people would say.
He died worrying about
what you and people like you would say.
If he had ever loved me,
even just a little...
...he'd have stopped to think about what
I was doing out there on my own.
He didn't.
Did you ever call me?
Ask me how I was?
No.
You wrote me off in a heartbeat.
Is this the love for a child?
I went where my life took me.
I'd do it all over again.
I wanted to sing, and I did!
Even if it ends like this,
I have no regrets!
To hell with your dignity!
No offense, sister,
but I won't apologize to you.
Because you've dug your own graves.
Don't try to put the shovel
in my hands now.
I didn't even touch your grave, sister!
I didn't.
At least he had a loved one with him
when he left this world.
Ayperi... There was no one else.
He loved you, only you.
Darling, I meant the red car.
"A Horrible Traffic Accident"
"The Sad Loss of
Famous Musician Tarik Ertugrul"
"Ayperi's Husband Tarik Ertugrul
Passed Away"
From now on,
it's just the two of us, Ayperi.
Look, we'll make it through this.
We'll get back up on our feet.
I promise.
Anytime you need a shoulder to rest on,
I will be here.
Ayperi, I'm... - Erhan!
Don't say such things.
Let's sing.
Let's be friends and just sing.
Without the music,
these words are breaking my heart.
Let's sing.
We had a fight.
It was the last thing we did.
If only he could come now,
for only five minutes.
I would apologize to him.
He'd kiss me once and leave.
There, we'll get to the bridge
and move half a tone up.
- I guess you didn't like the song.
- Erhan, no...
Ayperi, listen...
I know I'm not as good as Tarik.
But if you help me...
I know how you sang his songs
with love...
Okay. I won't say "love".
It has nothing to do with the song.
I swear.
It's just...
Sometimes, I get lost in my thoughts.
Let's write the lyrics together.
We need to work with
brand new composers.
Erhan, I'm sorry to say this...
...but we made this record because
you insisted, and it didn't sell.
It should have sold millions at a time
when the public feels so sorry for you.
I don't want them to pity me, Kemal.
I want them to listen to my music.
So, shake it off and come around, kiddo.
Sorry, you know
I'm a bit straightforward.
I can't make you sing bad songs
just for the sake of friendship.
I'll be searching for new composers.
Okay, but please don't fire Erhan.
Let him stay in the band.
I feel better when he's around.
He knows my voice, my tone.
We worked together all these years.
Okay, okay. Don't worry.
Erhan's with us.
Thanks.
We'll start a long play right away.
Then, we'll organize a tour.
Let's break this silence of death.
Let's break it.
You know how they toss those
crappy rose petals over your head?
It pisses me off to no end.
They stick to my mouth, my face...
You waited too long!
You're gonna burn my hair!
Goblet drum, don't start there!
Your cue is the lyrics!
Why are you yelling at me?
Don't get so mad.
- That's plain belly dance music.
- No, Erhan.
It's just a wobbly rhythm.
I think we are wobbly.
People like this kind of music.
This is what they listen to nowadays.
Look, if this album sells,
then we can do whatever music we like.
I see some people among us
feel sorry for themselves.
It must be because of the rhythm.
Look, I'm putting up with this
only for you. Only for you.
We changed our style, that's why.
My listeners are not used to this.
And new listeners think
I still make the same music.
And we can't satisfy anyone.
I don't know, Ayperi.
Your lyrics are not the same either.
What are we going to do?
Find that innocent Ayperi within you.
Find her and bring her back.
Do whatever it takes,
but bring me a hit song.
Why couldn't this world be enough
for you? Why did you have to leave?
Tarik...
Tarik...
I miss you so much.
So much.
So...
Why wasn't it enough for you?
Okay.
"My darling, my precious.
You're sleeping like an angel right now.
I wanted to surprise you.
I saved my best song for you.
We'll see when you will find it."
Maybe you'll never find it,
I don't know.
But a voice inside says that...
...one day, you'll read this letter
and find the song.
If you are reading this,
and I'm with you...
...look at me,
look deep into my eyes.
If I'm not with you...
Life is life, anything is possible.
I want you to know that
I've always loved you.
You are my only one,
my fairy girl.
If we ever fight one day...
...let this letter be an apology
for the both of us."
It was inside the frame.
He says hi.
I think I'm his messenger.
Be careful after I leave.
You don't know anything about
fund management.
Don't let anyone rip you off.
Bad people are everywhere.
Are we really going to talk about this
right now?
What should we talk about?
Why are you leaving?
- Don't you see?
- I don't.
You're right, how can you?
If you carry a weight
for a really long time...
...you forget that it's there.
Erhan, please don't be stupid.
"I don't want them to pity me, Kemal.
I want them to listen to my music."
Get it?
It turns out that
I don't have any music for anyone.
We got that.
Everyone I love goes away.
Damn, they always go away.
Always.
Mrs. Ayperi!
Could we get an autograph?
Mrs. Ayperi, I love you so much.
- I don't have any photos with me.
- I do.
Don't you forget about us.
You, me, Tarik...
Never forget about us, fairy girl.
Keep us in your thoughts.
Whenever life hurts you,
think about us, remember how we were.
Go on.
Go.
Go and sing your songs.
"Renowned Producer Kemal Tasciyan
Dies of a Heart Attack"
"A Devastating Loss
for the Music Business"
Where are you going, girl?
Where are you going?
What are you doing
out in the street?
He called for me.
There were giant chandeliers.
I had a home. Where is it?
It's here.
Your home is right here, darling.
Come on. Let's go home.
Come on, honey.
Come on, sweetheart. Go inside.
Sister! Did I go outside?
What are you going to do with me?
What am I going to do with you?
I'll travel with you.
I'll sit with you.
I'll prepare tarhana with you.
I'll do everything
that I couldn't do with you.
She's been here for two months.
It was okay until today...
...but this morning
she completely lost it.
I found her wandering
very early in the morning.
Of course, she's a bit upset now.
She took her pills, she's resting.
You are going to have to excuse her.
Mrs. Hanife? I want to take a picture
of you two today. You promised.
Slow down, girl.
Let's see when she wakes up.
Okay.
Samet, give me a yoghurt, boy.
You're famous now, Mrs. Hanife.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Here.
"Faded star Ayperi
is in dire straits."
Nonsense!
"Famous star diagnosed with Alzheimer's
took shelter in her sister's house.
Ayperi, who's having trouble
remembering her name..."
Hande!
Come out here, you whore!
That's the photo you took!
Mrs. Hanife!
I swear, I didn't do anything!
The press found it online and used it!
I did nothing wrong!
It's all the media!
What media!
You wrote the entire story as a caption!
- She did it, Mrs. Hanife!
- God damn you, Samet!
- You'll pay for this window, Hanife!
- No way in hell!
- Oh God, I have holy bread in my hand!
- Well said, Mrs. Hanife!
Get the hell out of here!
I've had enough of you!
Madam, I'm not a journalist.
Who are you?
You can tell Ayperi that Erhan is here.
I hope she remembers.
Of course I remember.
I'm not dead yet, sir.
- It's been so long, Erhan.
- So long.
Erhan was frustrated with the business.
He upped and left.
I moved to Izmir.
I started a real estate business.
I heard that you got married there.
After that, we didn't get any more news.
I got divorced.
You are amazing.
Are you sure you're ill?
You remember everything.
I'm rewinding.
Now, I'm at the part
where you were with me.
Don't go any further back then.
Stay there.
I'll make us some tea.
They've been trying to reach you
for days.
I think your sister is
always hanging up the phone.
Ayperi, they want to organize
a concert in Istanbul in your honor.
If you say "yes",
the preparations will start in a week.
Young, fresh pop singers
will perform for you.
And they want you to perform
at the end of the night.
If you want to, of course.
If you don't,
you'll just be a member of the audience.
There will be a huge orchestra.
I'll play too.
Some of the proceeds will be donated to
the Alzheimer's Foundation.
The rest will cover
your treatment expenses.
The cast will be huge.
I think you look amazing.
You can get on the stage
for the last time and sing.
We can sing together.
What do you think?
Is it the beginning of summer,
or the end?
The end.
God forbid,
what if she forgets the songs?
What if she does something wrong?
No way.
I can't let my sister be humiliated.
What if they laugh at her? What if she
gets upset? What if she gets worse?
No, no.
As long as I have you,
I'll be just fine, dear sister!
Watch me on stage for the first time.
For the first and the last time.
Let me sing my songs.
Erhan my darling, I can't remember.
I can't. I have no tone, nothing.
It's okay. It's been too long.
One more time?
For God's sake,
what chord is that?
It's not working.
How about this: Let's listen to
everything from the beginning.
- Records, CDs, whatever.
- I have none of those.
No, I can't do it.
I am not going to be able to perform.
I can't do it.
"What do you see" asked my inner self.
"Passion" said, my even more inner self.
"Did you have it" asked my inner self.
"I should have had it"
my even more inner self.
You are the big sister.
You're the first-born.
You've protected your unborn child.
Stick the needle in your vein.
Let your blood be hers.
Come with me.
Sister...
Your sister died of love, my child.
Come on. Get in.
I'll give you food and beverages
once in a while.
Listen, don't come out of here
without becoming Ayperi.
You hear me? Don't!
Mrs. Ayperi, two minutes to go.
I'm heading for the stage.
See you there.
Good luck.
I can't do it.
I can't, sister. I'm too scared.
Okay. Then don't.
There was this little girl.
She stood up to the world.
She feared nothing. Remember?
Call her. Let her do it!
Ladies and gentlemen, Ayperi!
Thank you. Thank you.
I wanted to give a speech,
but I couldn't be sure of myself.
So I wrote it down.
You know, I forget.
We didn't forget you!
Speaking of forgetting...
We love you!
That reminds me of cheetahs.
Fastest runners on earth.
See, I remember that.
In the Aegean region, mountains lie
perpendicular to the sea.
I also remember that.
I wonder why...
Anyway. I should read this letter before
I talk about the multiplication table.
Actually, I want to confess something.
Throughout my career,
I've written lyrics for a single song.
That was the last composition of Tarik.
"Sevdim".
Yeah.
Other than that,
all the lyrics of my songs...
...my first singles and hits' lyrics
were written by my older sister.
I know, I know.
I should have told you this sooner.
I deeply apologize to her and to you.
And if you'll excuse me,
I want to share this night with her.
Sister, can you please
come on stage?
Come on.
Yes. Hanife Yesilyurt.
Take good care of her!
She's in your hands now!
"Apologizing is being big-hearted"
they say.
Since I gave my heart to music,
I don't know where it is anymore.
I sang songs all my life.
I have always been very happy.
Come on, guys.
Don't let go of my hand.
Whisper if I forget.
"How are you doing, girl?
Tell me your story."
This moment. Only this moment.
Even if I forget everything,
I'll remember this moment.
It's okay if I don't remember the rest.
Life! Thank you so much.
