Yes.
I think I can start painting
in the morning.
I think you're one of the most
selfish men I've ever met.
Dedicated.
Are you going to marry me?
I've told you, yes...
...as soon as I've got rid of a few debts
and some money in the bank.
- Bruno.
- Oh, now, for heaven's sake.
- We can't wait any longer, Bruno.
- Why not?
Because I...
Well, tell me, tell me.
Oh, come on now,
it's not as bad as all that.
- Just tell me why you have to get ma...
- I just do.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on now,
what's happening to you?
Tell me.
I'm going to have your baby.
That's what's happened.
When did you know?
A week ago.
- Where are you going?
- To see your father.
- Why?
- I'm not going to evade my obligations.
I want him to know that.
Your obligations?
Yes, I'm afraid
that's how he'll look at it.
Bruno.
Don't go to him, Bruno.
Bruno, wait.
- Well?
- He'll kill you if you go to him.
I doubt it.
Oh, Bruno.
Bruno!
What is it, Carla?
They're bringing the body in now.
- I want it in here.
- Very well.
And Inspector Kanof
is waiting to see you.
Thank you.
Well?
The girl is the daughter
of Janus Cass...
...landlord of the Saracen Inn.
This may not be the same
as the others.
- You mean, you hope it isn't.
- Naturally.
Seven unsolved murders
in five years...
...is hardly good
for my prestige here.
You think the young man did it?
Lovers sometimes quarrel.
He's still missing.
The young man's name
is Bruno Heitz.
He comes to Vandorf every year...
...and rents the old mill house.
He's an artist...
...son of Professor Jules Heitz
at Berlin University...
...Doctor of Literature.
- I know him.
We were students together.
- You'll get in touch with him?
- Immediately.
I suggest not immediately.
Wait until they find the young man.
As you say, doctor.
Thank you, Ratoff.
Wait here.
Madam.
Ratoff.
- How did this happen?
- She pounced on me, doctor.
- Soon as I got to the door of her cell.
- This is the second time.
- Put her in a straightjacket.
- Right.
- Sister, get those cuts attended to.
- Yes, doctor.
What's the matter?
Doctor, you'll perform an autopsy?
On a body that's turned to stone?
Inspector...
...listen.
They've picked up the scent.
We're getting too close
to the castle.
- Afraid?
- Yes, I am. I don't mind admitting it.
There are 20 men within a radius
of a quarter of a mile.
You've got a gun,
use it if you have to...
...but remember,
I want the boy taken alive.
Continue, inspector.
When I broke the news
of the girl's death to her father...
...he said it was no surprise to him.
What did you deduce from that?
That he knew of Bruno Heitz's
bad reputation.
Which you, personally,
had experienced?
Yes, sir.
There were certain incidents.
- Describe them, please.
- Drunkenness...
...bad behavior in public.
- Thank you.
- Call Janus Cass.
- Janus Cass.
Mr. Cass, you are the father
of the deceased girl, Sascha.
Yes, sir.
- Landlord of the Saracen Inn.
- Yes, sir.
Tell the court what you know
of the relationship...
...between your daughter
and this young man.
My girl loved him, unfortunately.
He took advantage of her and didn't
want to face the consequences.
When you say
"took advantage of her"...
...do you mean
she was pregnant by him?
Yes, sir,
he was a thoroughly bad lot.
I told Sascha
to have nothing to do with him.
- But she disobeyed you.
- I'm afraid so.
Did you personally observe
this man's addiction to alcohol?
Sir, he came frequently
to the Saracen Inn.
And in his cups,
a tendency to violence?
- Well, sir, I...
- Thank you, Mr. Cass.
You may stand down.
- Call Dr. Namaroff.
- Dr. Namaroff.
Now, doctor...
...will you tell us what, in your opinion,
was the cause of this girl's death?
Her death was undoubtedly
the result of violence.
I observed deep abrasions
around the forehead...
...and indentations
in the skull...
...which may have been caused
by some metal instrument.
Thank you, doctor.
Call Professor Heitz.
Professor Heitz.
You are Professor Jules Heitz...
...father of the deceased man,
Bruno Heitz?
- I am.
- You've heard the evidence...
...before this court?
- I have.
- Did you know the girl?
- No, sir.
From the evidence I've heard...
...I have the impression your son
was somewhat of a bohemian.
- Would you agree with that?
- He was a talented artist.
His life was of his own choosing.
I also have the impression
he was a libertine.
No.
He had a number of girlfriends.
Possibly. However, that does not
make him a libertine.
And one girlfriend in particular
whom he betrayed?
I cannot believe that.
You are his father.
- Have you anything you wish to add?
- Yes.
I read the newspapers...
...and I am also a student
of human nature.
I have read about
the unsolved Vandorf murders.
I have also listened
to the evidence...
...and opinions given in this court.
In my opinion, everything I have heard
has been generated by fear.
Proceed.
Evidence
so obviously circumstantial...
...prejudiced and contrived...
...making one innocent man
a scapegoat.
So obviously, indeed,
that I can forecast your verdict now:
Murder and suicide.
My son's innocence stained
to bring this witch-hunt...
...to a smug
and a satisfactory close.
That is all I have to say,
Mr. Coroner.
But believe me...
...I shall not rest until I have cleared
my son's good name.
If you have finished...
...you may stand down.
I find that the dead woman
was murdered...
...by her fianc√©, Bruno Heitz...
...who then, in a fit of remorse...
...took his own life.
Court is adjourned.
There have been seven murders
committed in Vandorf...
...in the past five years.
Every victim bore the same marks.
Each body turned to stone.
Why didn't you speak of this
at the inquest?
Why is everyone
trying to evade the truth...
...including you?
- Carla.
I expected Kanof to make a scapegoat
of that poor innocent boy, but not you.
Why are you so certain
that he's innocent?
Because she has come back.
She's here...
...somewhere...
...in this hospital. I know it.
Come in.
Professor Heitz
would like to see you, sir.
Show him in.
Professor, this is my assistant,
Miss Carla Hoffman.
- How do you do?
- That'll be all.
I shan't need you anymore today.
I'm so very sorry about your son.
You have my deepest sympathy.
- Thank you.
- Do sit down.
No, thank you.
I want to ask you a simple question.
Please.
You were once a guest
at my house in Berlin.
You met both my sons,
Bruno in particular.
- You talked to him at some length.
- I believe I did.
What impression
did you form of him?
Well, I thought he was...
Normal?
Why, yes, of course.
Yet capable of murder?
My dear Heitz,
that is hardly a fair question.
Given a certain set
of circumstances...
...I believe almost everybody
is capable of murder.
Naturally, you are prejudiced.
I have been in Vandorf
exactly two days.
I have asked questions
and received evasion.
I have called at police headquarters
and been refused admittance.
Everywhere I go
I find a conspiracy of silence.
Oh, I'm sure you exaggerate.
Oh, no, there's an explanation
somewhere.
It lies in the past.
Some horrible occurrence,
which has been suppressed.
To the people of Vandorf, this thing,
whatever it is, is real.
Something they cannot mention,
because they dare not.
They believe it doesn't exist.
The very admission of its existence
only increases their fear.
That's why my son
was branded a murderer.
He at least was human, tangible.
Doctor...
...I need your help.
I can add nothing
to what I said in court.
Let me ask you one more question.
Have you ever heard of Megaera?
- Megaera?
- She was one of three sisters.
They were known as Gorgons.
Two of them were slain.
According to the legend,
the third, Megaera, fled to these parts.
It's said that when mortals
looked upon her face...
...they were turned to stone.
That legend is 2000 years old.
So I believe.
We are men of science.
I don't believe in ghosts or evil spirits.
I don't think you do either.
That's one of the most unscientific
remarks I have ever heard.
I believe in the existence
of everything...
...which the human brain
is unable to disprove.
Or prove?
That is why
I'm remaining in Vandorf.
At least I intend to prove
that my son was not a murderer.
One moment.
A word of advice.
What is it?
Leave Vandorf before it's too late.
What is it you're afraid of?
- I'm afraid for you.
- Or of what I may discover if I remain?
Let's get to the house.
Come on, let's get him out.
Get out of Vandorf, Heitz.
- Go home, Heitz.
- Sir, don't you think we should...?
We want you out of this house,
mister, now.
Get out of my house, all of you.
Oh, so that's how it is.
Police.
Come on.
I hope you're not too badly hurt.
No.
If there is a repetition of this,
inspector, I shall hold you responsible.
I'm sorry.
My police force is very small.
We have other duties
besides giving protection...
...to unwelcome visitors.
Your business here is over.
Why don't you go?
My business is not over.
Very well.
I've warned you.
That's the best I can do.
If you should change your mind,
professor...
...l'll see you have safe conduct
to the station.
I want you to send a telegram...
...to Professor Meister
at Leipzig University.
Come in.
Oh, Paul,
this telegram has just arrived.
It's from your father. He wants you
to go to Vandorf immediately.
This is the first I've heard of my father
since Bruno was reported missing.
You'd better go, hadn't you?
There's a train that leaves
at 9 in the morning, I believe it is.
Yes, sir.
Hope you find everything all right.
Let me know if you want help.
Oh, and give my regards
to your father, won't you?
Yes, thank you, sir. Yes, I will.
Hans!
Hans!
- What's happened, sir?
- For God's sake...
...don't come nearer.
Your face.
Listen carefully.
I haven't much time, Hans.
I have to write a letter to my son,
Paul.
He should be here tomorrow.
In the morning...
...take the letter and give it to him.
No one else must see it but Paul.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Leave me now.
There is nothing you can do.
Goodbye, Hans.
Yes, you may see a copy
of the death certificate if you wish.
But as far as the body is concerned,
that is entirely up to the police.
They have refused permission for me
to see the body.
- Why?
- This is a police state, Mr. Heitz...
...they don't have to give reasons.
- Doctor, did you examine the body?
- Of course.
In your opinion, there was no doubt as
to the cause of death? Heart failure?
No doubt whatsoever.
How do you account for this?
"I am agonized by pains in my chest.
I am turning to stone."
- May I see that letter?
- Sorry.
My father gave instructions
that I was to show it to no one.
- I see.
- He knew he was dying...
...when he started to write.
He was able to write three pages.
Doesn't sound like heart failure.
You don't work through
a heart attack.
You know that as well as I.
He refers to "this terrible thing...
...stalking amongst the people
of Vandorf.
It turned Sascha to stone
and others before her...
...the conspiracy of silence
and the fear."
And he mentions "Megaera."
Does the name mean anything to you,
Dr. Namaroff?
You're not suggesting connection...
...between a character from mythology
and your father's death?
When he wrote this,
he knew what was happening to him.
He knew how he was dying
and why.
It wasn't heart failure.
That is your opinion.
No doubt you'll have an opportunity
to express it at the inquest.
When will it be held?
I don't know.
But I'll see that you're informed.
Goodbye, Mr. Heitz.
Please forgive me for intruding.
The door was open.
Who are you?
I'm Carla Hoffman...
...Dr. Namaroff's assistant
at the hospital.
You are Paul Heitz.
Can I help you?
I would like to help you if I can.
Does Namaroff know you're here?
He'd be very angry if he did.
Oh, please believe me...
...I only came here to see
if I can help you.
This afternoon,
you spoke to Dr. Namaroff?
- You spoke about Megaera.
- Yes.
Did Dr. Namaroff tell you...
...that the spirit of Megaera
roams this forest...
...and it has also been known
to enter this house?
No, he didn't.
For the reason that he doesn't believe
or says he doesn't.
- But you do.
- I don't know.
I only know that something terrible
is happening here.
Megaera does exist, Mr. Heitz.
- Have you seen her?
- No one has seen her and lived.
Namaroff believes in her?
- I know he does.
- Well, then why doesn't he admit it?
Because he's like all the rest.
He tries to deny the existence
of something he cannot explain.
Megaera is inexplicable
and terrifying.
But you must believe in her.
If you don't, you'll see no reason
to leave here.
And one day, you'll...
You'll be found like all the others.
Well, thank you for warning me.
But I have to find out things for myself.
I can't leave.
In less than one week,
I've lost my brother and my father.
I'm not concerned
about what happens to me.
I am concerned.
Thank you.
I'm very grateful to you.
I must go now.
I'm on duty in half an hour.
Goodbye.
I hope we'll meet again.
"Herbert Spencer once said
that every legend and myth...
...known to mankind...
...is not entirely
without its authentic foundation.
Presupposing he is right...
...we must go to the source of this...
...to a time over 2000 years ago,
to Ancient Greece."
There were three hideous
monsters...
...sisters...
...they were called Gorgons.
Their names were Tisiphone...
...Medusa and Megaera.
Their heads were crowned
with living snakes...
...and each snake was a tentacle
of the hellish brain...
...from which it sprang.
So hideous was the Gorgon...
...that anyone
who looked upon her...
...was petrified.
The proper word...
...is gorgonized...
...which literally means
"turned to stone."
Go on.
I'm sorry.
He came in just then.
That's all I had time to memorize.
I want you to trust me, Carla.
Why is this letter so important?
Because Professor Heitz
was a great student of mythology...
...and had he lived, he could have
provided a complete answer.
I had hoped to find it in that letter.
Has it helped you at all?
A little.
I can tell you that...
That devil. She's out.
Look for her. Don't come back
till you've found her.
- If I do find her, I'll kill her.
- Ratoff.
You'll bring her back alive.
I was about to tell you that Megaera
has taken on human form.
Human?
Don't try to talk.
Everything is all right.
Ratoff.
- Where is Dr. Namaroff?
- He's in the laboratory.
Would you ask him
to come here, please?
Miss Hoffman would like you
to go to Mr. Heitz's ward.
Very well.
Ratoff.
Yes, sir?
You said she was not quite dead
when you found her?
Not quite.
She had enough strength left
to spit in my face.
And then she died.
Thank you.
What happened to me?
Miss Hoffman
had some presentiment...
...something was gonna
happen to you.
We found you lying beside the pool
in your garden.
How long have I been here?
Five days.
- Five...?
- Lie still.
Can you remember what happened
before you fell?
Fell?
Don't you remember?
I remember...
I remember seeing something...
...reflected in the pool.
What was it?
A face.
It was horrible.
It was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen.
You must rest now.
I'll talk to you again in a day or two.
- In a day or two?
- You're in a very weak condition.
I don't want to overtax
your strength.
For pity's sake,
I must know about this...
This thing...
...whatever it was.
- I'm speaking to you as a doctor.
You're suffering from shock.
It's essential that you should rest.
I tell you I'm all right. Please...
...l've got to know.
I want you to look at yourself.
Now please do as I tell you.
It's all right. It's all right.
She was here. She came
into the room. I saw her.
You were dreaming.
No one's been here, I promise you.
She was leaning over me.
I could see the snake's head.
I tell you, she was here.
It was a dream. It was only a dream.
Try and rest.
Try and rest.
Mr. Heitz is ready to leave.
He'd like to see you before he goes.
Well, ask him to come in.
Mr. Heitz.
Sit down, Mr. Heitz.
I understand that the inquest
on my father was held a week ago.
Yes. He was buried
the day after you were taken ill.
Ms. Hoffman took the liberty
of sending a wreath on your behalf.
I'm very grateful to her.
You'll be leaving for Leipzig now?
No.
- Are you staying in Vandorf?
- I'm going back to the house.
Doctor, I think you would like
to unravel this mystery as much as I.
- Why can't we work together?
- I don't understand. What mystery?
Don't treat me
like one of your neurotic patients.
You know well
what I'm talking about.
I'm afraid I don't.
- Good day, Mr. Heitz. Good day.
- But, doctor...
You're afraid of her
like the rest of them, aren't you?
Well, I intend to find this creature.
- Indeed?
- And destroy it.
Come to my office, will you?
- Yes, sir?
- There's a full moon tonight.
Don't let her out of your sight.
I feel I have the right
to ask you a question.
What is it?
Is she in danger?
She may be close to death.
Somehow I knew you'd be here.
Why did Namaroff issue
a false death certificate?
Who is he trying to shield?
I know it's almost beyond belief,
but there's the evidence in that coffin.
A man who looked on her face
and was turned to stone.
Herbert Spencer once said...
...that every legend and myth
known to mankind...
...is not without
its authentic foundation.
You've read my father's letter.
Yes.
I lied to you.
Dr. Namaroff wanted that letter.
I memorized part of it.
Why did he want it?
He was hoping it would throw
a new light on Megaera.
Please don't hate me for this.
Why? Why are you
telling me this now?
I'm afraid.
- Of Namaroff?
- Yes.
In a way.
But why?
Well, go on. Tell me.
You asked me just now
who he's trying to shield.
I don't know.
He won't tell me.
Is Namaroff in love with you?
And jealous?
Yes.
Then why don't you leave him?
I wish I could.
Carla?
I'll take you away with me now.
- Paul, I can't leave.
- Please don't be afraid.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Then leave Namaroff.
- I can't, Paul. I just can't.
- But why, if you love me? Why not?
- I don't know.
- I don't know why.
- Carla.
Paul.
Please...
...don't ask me again.
Well, do you propose to keep me
standing out here all night?
Professor Meister.
Oh, I can't tell you
how glad I am to see you.
Good heavens, Paul.
What's happened to you?
Well, I've been ill.
Ill?
You look as if you've been in
your grave and dug your way out.
- Where have you been?
- Here, in Vandorf.
I hadn't seen you
for some considerable time...
...so I thought I'd come and see
what you had been doing.
It's a long story.
I've come a long way to hear it.
Could I offer you
some refreshment?
No, nothing like that, thank you.
I ate on the train.
Now, tell me your story.
Were you out tonight, Carla?
Yes.
Where did you go?
For a walk.
Were you alone?
Yes.
It isn't a pretty sight.
It never ceases to amaze me
why the most noble work of God...
...the human brain, is the most
revolting to the human eye.
Do you remember
when we found Paul Heitz?
I do.
It was the night Martha escaped...
...and you told me that Megaera
had taken on human form.
Well?
Was it Martha?
No, Carla, it wasn't Martha.
You suspect somebody.
It's too early to say.
We work so closely together.
I have a right to know.
Please tell me.
Not until I'm sure.
Good night, Carla.
So you only saw her reflection?
It was enough.
When Perseus beheaded Medusa...
...he guided his blow by looking at her
reflection in the shield that he carried.
If your story is true,
the girl, Sascha...
...must have looked directly at the
Gorgon and so did your father.
What spared you
is that you saw her reflection.
- This much we know.
- Then you believe me?
I'm not saying that Megaera exists.
Unquestionably, you saw something.
Hallucination or not,
it was certainly real enough to you.
- She was not a hallucination.
- No, of course not.
Oh, professor,
please don't try to humor me.
Is the idea of Megaera any stranger
than the theory of reincarnation...
...which admits to a spirit
inhabiting a human body?
Probably not, but that particular
theory has yet to be proved.
- Do you believe it?
- I neither believe it nor disbelieve it.
Now, as to your own story...
...let us start with the assumption
that Megaera...
...in some form or another...
...has indeed returned.
Have you met many people
since you've been here?
Very few.
Any women?
- Only the one I told you about.
- Oh, yes, Carla. Carla...?
Hoffman.
What's she like?
Very beautiful.
I see.
You're in love with her?
- I didn't say so.
- You didn't have to.
I'll have that drink
you offered me now.
Under no circumstances will I permit
such a thing. There is no precedent.
Don't use long words, inspector.
They don't suit you.
If you don't wish to be of assistance,
that's your affair. I'll go higher up.
- Higher up?
- I presume that even you...
...acknowledge the existence
of a superior.
- How dare you?
- The foreign secretary, for example.
- I would like to point out...
- A friend of my brother.
But don't bother about it, inspector.
I'll go and see him myself.
- It will not...
- Yes, you were saying?
It will not be necessary, professor.
It was just that your request
startled me for a moment...
...but no doubt
you have a very good reason.
Now, let me see. You wish to inspect
the photographs and records...
Of all the women aliens registered
here within the last 10 years.
Well, I'll go and get the files.
Visitors to Vandorf
are only required to register...
...if they wish later
to become citizens.
This is, of course,
a very democratic state.
That's a lovely girl, professor.
This look like her?
- It hardly does her justice, but...
- It looks like her.
How long has she been here?
Well, the information
is on the back.
Seven years.
- When did these murders start?
- Murders?
Which you failed to solve...
...and which your democratic state
so carefully concealed.
When did they start?
- Approximately...
- Not approximately. Exactly.
Five years ago.
Thank you.
Oh, incidentally, I understand
some of your democratic citizens...
...tried to eject
the late Professor Heitz.
You'd better warn them not to attempt
that behavior with me. Good day.
Dr. Namaroff.
- What is it?
- Mr. Heitz is on the telephone.
He wants to make an appointment
to see you with Professor Meister.
- Meister?
- From Leipzig University.
I can't see them.
Tell them I'm busy.
Mr. Heitz was very insistent.
Carla, please.
Do as I say.
Carla.
When you went for your walk
last night, you said you were alone.
You lied to me.
Do I have to account to you
for everything I do?
You were with Paul Heitz,
weren't you?
- Why don't you ask Ratoff?
- I'm asking you.
I am tired of being treated
like a criminal.
Why does Ratoff follow me
everywhere I go?
Why are you spying on me?
I'm trying to protect you.
I don't believe you.
I've told you before. There are times
when you shouldn't be alone.
Tell me about those times.
Tell me what happens to me.
I can't yet.
- It's all an invention.
- No.
- You're trying to frighten me.
- I want to take care of you.
So that I'll submit
to being treated like a prisoner.
I've had enough.
I am sick of your jealousy.
I am sick of you.
Paul?
I'm sorry,
Dr. Namaroff won't see you.
- Well, why not?
- He says he's too busy.
Paul, meet me tomorrow morning
at the Castle Borski at 7:00.
Hello?
Hello, Carla?
Well?
Namaroff refuses to see us.
Paul.
Why did you want to come here?
They're less likely to follow me.
No one dares come near
the Castle Borski.
When was it last inhabited?
Fifty years ago.
Except for her.
Her?
Megaera.
Why did you want to see me
so urgently?
Have you changed your mind?
Oh, yes, Paul.
I will come away with you.
You will?
I don't feel chained to Vandorf
anymore.
I'm not afraid any longer.
I'll go with you, Paul...
...but it must be now.
Not immediately, Carla.
- Why?
- Professor Meister is trying to help me.
Do what?
Find Megaera.
Oh, Paul. Oh, Paul, don't stay.
If you love me, take me away
while there's still time.
- Just as soon as I can. I promise you.
- Now, Paul, now.
It won't be long, Carla.
It'll be too late.
I must go.
I may never see you again.
Carla.
Oh, Paul.
Carla. Carla, listen to me.
Paul.
Did you recognize him?
It was Ratoff.
One of the attendants
at the hospital.
Perhaps, you'd be good enough
to tell me where you're going.
- But why did Ratoff try to kill me?
- I suggest you ask Dr. Namaroff that.
Carla?
Ratoff, have you seen Carla?
Went to her room.
"Carla Hoffman.
Probationary nurse here in 1903.
In 1905, believed to be suffering
from loss of memory."
In other words, amnesia.
That was five years ago.
"In 1906, underwent intensive
treatment and was apparently cured.
Meanwhile, continued to work
in her profession."
Now, let's put
some of these pieces together.
The first Vandorf murders coincided
with these attacks of amnesia.
A condition of which Namaroff
was well aware.
Ordinarily, this would have put an end
to her career as a nurse...
...but Namaroff, as you've told me,
is in love with her.
- For heaven's sake.
- Just a minute.
In 1906, Namaroff closed the case
and stated that she was cured.
But was she cured?
- I don't think so.
- For what reason...?
Just a moment. I'm coming to that.
She told you
that she was being watched.
- Because Namaroff is jealous.
- Possibly.
And possibly also because
she still loses her memory...
...around the time of the full moon.
How do you know that?
It's all here, Paul. All the dates...
...when the amnesia occurred
and reoccurred.
Then you seriously believe it?
- You seriously suspect Carla is...?
- Why shouldn't I?
- I'm not in love with her.
- Oh, you're mad.
A young girl as beautiful as Carla?
I'm not making
any physical comparisons, Paul...
...between her and Megaera.
Megaera died 2000 years ago.
It's her spirit
we're concerned with today.
It's found a resting place
in somebody.
- Not Carla.
- In the cemetery...
...you begged her to go away.
She refused. Why?
She was not ready to leave.
She couldn't leave, Paul.
It was the full moon.
The spirit of Megaera
was too strong.
And then, today,
she asked you to take her away.
- Didn't she? Lmmediately.
- She was frightened of Namaroff.
- Did she say so?
- Yes.
I'll tell you
why she was frightened, Paul.
Because tonight
is the first night of the full moon.
Oh, this is guesswork.
It's monstrous, circumstantial,
utterly without reason.
I should've taken her away. I stayed
because I thought you needed me.
I do need you, Paul.
Oh, no, not after this.
All you need is somebody
to agree with you.
And what are you trying to do
to me? To Carla? Destroy us?
Paul.
Paul.
I had to see you again.
It's all right.
We're going away today.
It's too late.
Why?
Why is it too late?
I don't know.
I could have gone yesterday.
But now I just can't go.
It seems we have visitors.
You had better take her upstairs.
Come on.
I wish to see Mr. Heitz.
Will you tell him, please?
- I take it that you are Dr. Namaroff?
- I am.
Come in.
My name is Meister, Karl Meister.
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.
I'd like to make this brief.
This morning,
a young woman was seen...
...in the grounds of this house.
- Indeed.
I have reason to believe
she is here now.
Is she a patient of yours, doctor?
I am responsible for her.
Yes. Yes, of course, an amnesia victim
is a great responsibility.
What did you say?
One never really knows
what they're capable of, does one?
They might even commit murder
during one of their lapses.
And no one would be any the wiser.
Where is Carla?
She is not here.
You're lying.
Search the house.
I warn you not to obstruct the law.
I have a search warrant.
Mr. Heitz, if she's not found,
I shall charge you with her abduction.
On what grounds?
I can produce the evidence.
Speaking of evidence,
Dr. Namaroff...
...perhaps you'd be good enough
to return this to Mr. Ratoff.
He left it behind him when he
attempted to kill Mr. Heitz yesterday.
- What are you insinuating?
- I'm not insinuating anything, doctor.
You sent Ratoff to follow Carla
to the Castle Borski...
...where she met Paul.
When she left, Ratoff attempted
to kill Paul with this knife.
Why do you want Paul
out of the way, Namaroff?
Is it because you're afraid
he'll take Carla away from you?
Or because you think he'll find out
the secret that you share with Ratoff?
Answer me.
How dare you?
Take your hands off of me.
Professor Meister.
If you don't release the doctor
this instant, I won't hesitate to shoot.
- Well?
- She's not in the house.
- Have you looked in every room?
- Everywhere.
- The attic. You searched the attic?
- She's not there.
Where is she, Paul?
I told them the truth.
Where has she gone?
In about an hour's time,
there's a train for Leipzig.
She will be on it.
You arranged for somewhere
for her to stay in Leipzig, Paul?
She will be at the Hotel Kramer.
And you will be joining her there?
When we've found Megaera.
You should have gone with her.
I was very tempted.
Well, why didn't you?
You came here because of me.
When we've found Megaera,
I shall join Carla in Leipzig.
I shouldn't depend on that, Paul.
She won't reach Leipzig.
She won't even be on the train.
Are you persisting
in this preposterous theory?
If they find her before she reaches
the station, I have proved nothing.
If she does reach the station, she will
be in Leipzig this evening at 5:00.
In which case, I suggest you telephone
the Hotel Kramer about 5:30.
Come in.
- Any news?
- No, sir.
- Police will be giving up in an hour.
- Giving up?
They won't search after dark.
It's a full moon, Dr. Namaroff.
The second night of the full moon.
You haven't forgotten
it's the night Megaera usually strikes?
Get out.
Carla.
Carla.
You're quite sure?
Yes, thank you.
She hasn't arrived.
They must've caught her
before she got to the station.
I doubt it. I hope for your sake
I'm wrong, but we're looking for truth.
That she hasn't arrived
proves nothing.
But do we discard my theory because
it upsets your scheme of things?
Or do we go on
looking for the truth?
She's out there. I'm going to look.
Wait, Paul. In an hour's time,
it'll be dark. Wait until the morning.
Paul. Paul, you won't find Carla.
Get out of my way.
I am sorry, Paul,
but I can't let you destroy yourself.
What the devil do you want?
I have a warrant for the arrest
of Paul Heitz.
- On what charge?
- The abduction of Carla Hoffman.
Oh, that's ridiculous. You saw
that she wasn't in the house.
Will you please inform Mr. Heitz?
I'll give him five minutes
to get dressed.
He's not there.
- Well, where is he?
- I haven't the slightest idea, inspector.
You will accompany me
to the station.
- I shall do no such thing.
- Bring him along.
Carla.
Carla.
I am waiting for Carla, Mr. Heitz.
Carla.
She's free now, Paul.
She's free.
