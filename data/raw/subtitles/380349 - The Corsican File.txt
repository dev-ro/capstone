Pink Flamingo to all units.
We're 100% operational.
So are we. Have been for 1hr!
Jupiter to Ramuncho. A-OK?
Ramuncho here.
We want Ange Leoni, no one else!
When he shows, we grab him.
They're looking for you
on the wrong side of the harbor.
It's a g rand turnout, they're all there.
The State Police in the candy truck...
Local cops: Grappa and Balducci,
at the Marseille guy's place.
- His food still as lousy?
- Worse!
He jusTopened a new joint,
the "Pinocchio".
The "Pinocchio"?
How original!
Even the Security Branchis here!
The Ramunchos in flip-flops
and fancy shirts.
They're a disgrace.
Wasting time on disguises!
Pink Flamingo to all units.
Jag coming into the harbor.
Gotcha, strength 5, Captain.
You hear me, boys? A blue Jaguar!
You're all we hear, Balducci!
Calling all agents! A blue Jag.
You copy me?
Is that him?
Answer!
Watch this!
Go, go, go! That's him!
Stop that!
Freeze! We've got you!
Don't!
It's not Leoni! Who summoned you?
Who told you to move in?
You did!
De Vlaminck, Security Branch!
Which idiot said "Go! "?
Pretty funny, huh?
I'm not leaving this island yet!
THE CORSlCAN Fl LE
Breche, can you hear me?
I'll e-mai I the photos. I repeat.
I'll e-mai I the first photos.
Breche? Did you get them?
Answer me, damm it!
- Yes, sir. They're on my screen.
- Fine.
Operation Yellow Dragon is over.
You have another call: a notary.
- I'll put you through to Mr...
- No names over the phone.
I've told you before!
Ask what it's about. Over and out.
The espresso machine's jam med.
The Lion's club meet in North Paris.
BuTon the 17th, I'm in Montlucon?
Absol utely.
That notary's waiting
in your office.
Never let anyone wait
alone in my office!
It's a fine country mansion
100 miles south of Paris.
Mr Leoni, the heir to it,
I ives in Corsica.
Excuse me...
Breche, rent me a car to go to Montlucon.
The train's too slow.
Where were we?
The estate has been valued
at 2 million Euros.
If you find Mr Leoni,
your fee will be 5% of that sum.
5%...
Got any elements? Photos, leads,
- results of previous searches?
- Not much.
Except Mr Leoni is from Rossignoli.
A mountain village
above Ajaccio.
- Do you know Corsica?
- Not at all.
A pity.
Why?
Corsicans are a touchy
and secretive people.
I wish you knew them a bit.
Their behavior codes
aren't like ours.
Mr Dargent,
I handled a tricky case
during the recent Buntu-Buntu uprising.
You know the Buntu-Buntu?
Can't say I do.
There I was dodging machetes,
so the Corsicans don't scare me.
Why the bu I ldog logo?
Because inever let go!
Have a nice day.
- Been to Corsica, Breche?
- Was with my hubby.
Say: "l went there... "
I have to find a man
who inherited a tidy sum.
We never found
a decent salami there.
What's the connection?
"The gem of France", they call it.
You Corsican?
Yes.
Are there taxis when we land?
It's not a jungle.
We have taxis, too.
Thanks. It's my first visit.
Taxi!
It's locked!
It's locked!
- The trunk...
- What about the trunk?
You'll see!
this year our team's unbeatable!
Bastia's a team of goats!
Excuse me, sir!
One second.
Where to, sir?
To Rossignoli.
If you say so.
Bastia are bums.
Need a ride uphill?
Wait! I hired a cab, not a mini bus!
We're headed for Blood River.
Just trying to lower your cabfare.
Is Rossignoli far?
Just over there.
An hour to do twenty miles?
The road's no bowling alley.
Hope You're not carsick.
I Just redid the upholstery.
Not at all.
My inner ear works fine.
You're in no danger.
I'm a good sailor,
I grew up in Brittany.
I don't get it...
It's best to eat something.
No Thanks, very kind of you.
It's weird...
Is that Rossignoli, up there?
So they say.
I'd rather do the last lap on foot.
Through the scrub is shorter,
but it's a maze.
It's magnificent!
You know the area.
I'm looking for Mr Ange Leoni.
Name mean anything to you?
At the square rock,
left and left again.
Past the fork,
head for the eucalyptus tree.
Left, right, keep going.
You're in Rossignoli.
I have to go on my own?
Sorry, sir. I'm looking
for Mr Leoni's house.
Ange Leoni.
Thanks. Very nice of you.
Thanks.
- Anice-cold Vichy, please.
- Got none.
- An Orezza with ice cubes?
- I don't know it. What's that?
Ice cubes? Little cubes
of frozen water.
The local mineral water?
Fine!
Sure, You're beautiful.
Bet he's a good guard dog, right?
He's picky.
Why spend a fortune
on a thorough bred dog?
Nothing like a nice mongrel!
right, boy?
One,
she's a lady.
Two, she's a Corsican bitch, sir.
Of course, We're in Corsica.
A bitch of the Corsican breed!
What breed is that?
A Corsinu.
A Corsinu...
People fight for them.
Litters are booked years ahead.
If you say so.
Do you happen to know
Mr Ange Leoni?
We're only 5th generation here.
We don't know everyone.
Yes, of course.
The toilet, please?
Can't a cell phone get Through?
Even the bread can't get Through, sir.
Things going fine, sir?
Sure, Breche. All I have to do is
tell a guy he won the sweepstakes!
- Nice weather?
- Glorious!
I'll call you. Over and out.
A local farmer
won the lottery and went mad.
Slaughtered his herd!
right.
right.
To night we must end
our fratricidal quarrels,
and unite
All Corsican nationalist movements!
All represented here
except for those extrem ist pigs
of Corsica Nazionale!
We must adopt
a common position on violence.
I've thought it over
and I propose:
we condemn violence...
but not its perpetrators.
Well spoken!
I like that!
It's good!
Adopted unanimously.
Let's get down to the agenda:
a traitor to his homeland!
I mean, Ange Leoni.
By hijacking money
for Corsican nationAllsm,
he dishonored our cause.
- Precisely!
- Quite!
He betrayed his people for personal gain!
Right.
this scumbag deserves
an exemplary punishment.
Let's have a vote.
OK. We want the money back!
That's right,
first the money.
Ange? What are you...?
Got a sl ice of salami here?
Bi rd ie, that's my place.
You spoke of me beh ind my back.
No, we d id n't...
What's this proced u re?
right. What's this proced u re, Figol i?
- What?
- What is it?
- What is it?
- this proced u re?
- Yes, this proced u re...
- It's what we were saying...
Where is he? What's he doing?
You got the answer. He's here,
and he's going to eat.
Got a g lass of red?
After a month in the wi lds,
you look g reat, Ange.
I d id n't come here for a check-up.
Two things.
The money...
I d id n't steAllt, I borrowed it.
No need to say it.
We never dou bted that.
right, Figol i?
You nod like puppets!
Is that what you are?
No one's afraid here...
Don't sq uawk, Bi rd ie.
What's your problem?
We have a right to speak up!
When will you
g ive us back this money?
Or won't you?
When I've refinanced
my business in Spain.
- You in a h u rry?
- No...
The other even ing,
All the cops on the island
were waiting for me.
Who sn itched?
We want to know, too.
If I ever catch that bastard!
I have to go.
Good I uck, Ange.
Farewel l, Figol i.
- What d id he say?
- Farewel l.
- Who to?
- To you.
Ange, I have to go.
If you need anything.
God be with you.
- W e' I l ask arou nd.
- Good I uck.
Bi rd ie!
You stay here!
I don't know who sn itched on you!
If I d id, wou ld I Just sit here?
Don't call me Bi rd ie!
I'm not a kid.
A main lander's looking for me.
You heard?
Seems you won the lottery.
Me?
inever play!
Even ing, gentlemen.
I don't m ind fol ksongs,
but I sleep right above.
What fol ksongs?
They' re sacred hym ns, sir.
Sure, they' re lovely,
but will it last long?
They tell our people's history.
That's what matters to Corsicans:
hope and freedom.
I u nderstand, but it's 2 AM.
Pour h i m a g lass of myrthe.
nice of you,
but it's late for a nightcap.
So yourefuse our friendsh i p d rin k?
No, but with lots of ice cubes.
With tons of ice.
Than k you, gentlemen.
I'll head back to bed.
- Al ready?
- I'd better.
It's rude. Not after the owner's rou nd.
So it's my rou nd now?
Same again.
It's good : both sweet and strong.
Sorry, I have to h it the sack.
Don't leave when it's my rou nd!
- Stay a bit longer.
- Sure!
I wasn't leaving,
Just catch ing a breather.
Cheers!
Fine mood...

I was in the cafe earl ier.
Yes?
W e Corsicans don't like q uestions
from outsiders.
But your req uest seems leg iti mate,

The toi lets are on the left in the yard.
The hood, Mateo. Let's go.
One second, l' I l fin ish my cigarette.
You smoke too much. It' I l ki I l you.
I'll try that anti-tobacco pacht.
What "pacht"? The word is patch!
OK, you u nderstood me,
that's what matters.
Get going.
Thanks.
What's myrthe made with?
- What's up?
- Don't try anything!
You'll reg ret any senseless violence!
H i, Fernand.

What do we do, Captain?
Fol low. But don't endanger
our men or eq u i pment.
Ch ief, Leoni Just kid napped
the gumshoe.
Follow them!
What do you want with Ange Leoni?
- It's confidential.
- Don't tal k so loud.
That wasn't loud.
So Leoni won the lottery?
- So to speak.
- Don't put me on!
Leoninever buys lottery tickets!
What's this scam?
I know that.
But it's as if he had played.
That's why I said "So to speak".
W e have com pany.

Drive on q u ietly.
Don't provoke them.

25 ki log rams.
They' re blasting everywhere!
How about going to a d isco?
A d isco?
You know, I have g reat faith in women.
That's good.
Here, like everywhere,
only women can end violence.
That's for Sure...
They g ive I ife.
They' re the doves of peace.
If we I istened them
in the M idd le East...
What you say is true.
It's profound, too.
Thanks.
Odd place to open a d isco.
Are we there?
I changed my m ind.
You're as su rprising as this island.
Sure I am.
What's got into you?
Can you d rive slower?
Scared in cars, Jack?
No, I've been a rally d river!
But lobster pasta
and mountain roads don't m ix.
What's going on?
GeTout!
That's good, you su rvived the shock.
Yes. 1 27 bends in all.
We're 30 deg rees
south of the Shepherd's star.
I know exactly where we are.
Keep it to yourself.
Here, the less you know,
the better.
You, again?
- You've met?
- Yes, on the plane.
- You're m istaken.
- Sure.
What's the deal this ti me?
We want to see you.
"We. " this is d u m b!
Screw the "we"!
I want to see Ange Leoni. Ange Leoni!
What do you want with me?
Oh, it's you?
You're hard to reach.
I'm here for a notary in Montarg is,
Mr Dargent, to g ive to you in person
this deed to a property.
But how do I know You're Mr Leoni?
You have your I D?
You're cute!
Lea...
check out Mr Dargent in Montarg is.
Did you touch her?
H u h? Touch who?
My wife. Did you touch her?
Don't start that again, Mateo.
We were married 3 months,
we d ivorced 6 years ago!
Answer!
Did he touch you, yes or no?
Stop, Mateo, that's enoug h.
Cover yourself, Lea. You look cheap!
Next ti me do your own d i rty work!
He screwed your sister
and you don't act?
No way! I d id n't screw anybody!
Wou ld she sleep
with any id iot who shows up?
Why d id n't she answer?
You know, Lea,
I hear what you don't say!
OK, we h u m ped like dogs,
on Napoleon Aven ue!
- Happy now?
- I mean, no...
Sorry, I wasn't speaking to you, sir.
Attorney Dargent in Montarg is.
Yes, l' I l wait.
What does it say, Ange?
I in herited a 2 m i I l ion Eu ro
shack in central France.
Is that so bad?
I'll let you celebrate it
in the fam i ly. Good night.
I don't know central France.
My whole fam i ly is here.
I'm Corsican.
Who sent you?
I told you. Mr Dargent.
- l' I l string you up!
- l' I l waste h i m!
- Really...
- He fond led her!
Stop it. your u lcer will act up!
He said his name's Jack Pal mer.
It doesn't say that here.
He's lying. He raped her!
My real name's Rem i Francois.
Jack Palmer is for my work.
Sounds a bit American. Very smart.
I mean...
I checked.
There is a Jack Palmer
detective agency.
Remi Francois.
Are you sure?
Whichis your first name?
There's no Attorney Dargent
in Montarg is.
What?
They m isinformed you!
It's not possi ble!
Don't shout! You'll upset the an i mals.
An i mals?
But he was in my office, in Paris!
I Just spoke to h i m...
He's a I iar! They had sex!
I'm Sure of it!
Mateo! Sh ut up!
You're kidd ing us,
or they' re kidd ing you.
Either way, You're in trou ble.
It's no g reat i m provement,
but I favor the 2nd hypothesis.
Lea, put h i m back in the car.
I'm com ing.
I can wal k.
Mateo, stay here.
Lea' I l d rop me in the bay.
He's got a plane ticket for tomorrow.
He knows nothing, Ange.
So did the cops manipulate
this cretin?
Why speak d ialect? I know ltAllan.
Corsican ' s no d ialect.
It' s a lang uage.
And it' s not like ltAllan!
But "cretino" means cretin in both!
Don't su I k, Sherlock Hol mes.
The cops took you for a ride.
They weren't the only ones!
How's your cram p?
- It went away, Thanks.
- Good.
Main lander, you never saw me!
You never came here.
If I see you again,
You're in trou ble.
What d id he say?
Don't worry, Ange is no band it.
He's a good i m itation of one!
Sh it!
Let me out!
I'm no parTof this business!
- Belt, Ange!
- What belt?
M ine's jam med!
- Sh it!
- What, sh it?
My belt doesn't work.
Two belts on the bl in k is odd.
Wou ld n't you say?
this is really...
- Sh it!
- Ru n!
And you, be a man!
Go!
A man! your brother isn't I i ly wh ite!
- He never ki I led anyone.
- That's what you say.
What's this...?
GeTout! Hands up!
What's going on?
Why are you here?
Where'd you come from?
We were Just kissing.
- Is that forbidden?
- Make fu n of me.
Check the trunk!
Where's your brother?
My God, if I knew...
- Did you see h i m? Speak up!
- Who?
You have a brother?
Really? How old is he?
OK. Wan na play d u m b? We can, too!
Isn't she an only ch i ld?
Ch ief, we've got 'em.
It's u nder control.
I'll ru n them in.
What's going on, Balducci?
- Nothing, Ch ief!
- What?
our car got swi ped.
But We're fine.
We' I l be off.
Can we d rop you somewhere?
Let go of me!
Later, we d ined at the "Pinocch io".
That's where inoticed
he was charm ing.
What d id you eat?
Lobster pasta. Too heavy for d inner.
right... "Mr Dargent"?
Ange? What's up?
They've arrested Lea.
She took me for a spin in the h i I ls.
And one th ing... Ied to another...
Of course, you d id n't
cross or see anyone?
Yes. Goats.
Little Corsican goats.
You're stressed out, Mateo.
What's worrying you?
Nothing...
Wel l, everyth ing...
Relax. They' re only cops.
And We're retu rn ing Their car.
your story doesn't hold up.
What has Leoni done
to get you All worked up?
I see...
Here even cops are tong ue-tied.
The Govern ment paid off
the Separatist g roups to get a truce.
Leoni was the m idd leman.
But he kept the money. How much?
Plenty.
nice going!
Pol ice infighting, govern ment schem ing,
taxpayer's money. A nice scandal.
You send in a sleuth.
No danger of a pol ice fuck-up.
I take the rap.
I'm a man of my word. You get 5%.
May I phone?
right, call h i m.
Set up a date with h i m.
The n u m ber of "The NationAllnq u i rer"?
Don't do that!
Then q u it bugg ing Lea and me.
My Lea. Did they harm you,
I ittle sister?
I'm fine, Ange.
- You mustn't stay here.
- What?
Are you being watched? If yes, coug h.
No, I was going to go to bed.
They wore me out.
Sh it.
Ange!
Mr Leoni, will you have a d rin k?
What's he doing here?
Nothing. They released us. And l...
Lea invited me in for a d rin k
to celebrate the occasion...
What's this?
The latest Paris fad?
- Drin king in briefs!
- No, wait...
Shame on Paris!
Ange, stop that i m med iately!
I invite who I want here!
I always let you see friends!
But you Just met h i m
and he's starko!
Just my pants... It's hot...
Put that away, Ange!
I'll screw whoever I want!
So there!
Lea, You're being excessive with...
Qu iet!
Not in fronTof Mama!
You, with an outsider!
She' I l tu rn in her g rave!
Leave Mama ouTof it!
You made her cry! Not l!
He's your brother!
It's only natu ral...
Sh ut up!
He's not to blame.
He d id n't rape me, dam m it!
I asked h i m in!
Lea, this is a matter
for men to settle!
We' I l deal with this outside.
Mr Leoni, don't stay here.
You're over enoug h barrels!
Barrels? Don't use fancy lang uage!
Cretino!
He saved us both.
He d id n't blab!
So he d id n't!
It's not enoug h to win you.
Ange, please.
No...
Sti I l, with regard to Lea,
you cou ld have asked me.
Actually, th ings gathered momentu m...
It's your I ife, not m ine.
So, celebrate.
Easy does it.
You're not pi loting the plane!
We shou ld get a move on.
Don't be a bore.
I'll call the pi lot, he's a pal.
So what d id you tel l
the Pol ice Ch ief?
I said we saw goats...
Little Corsican goats.
his face d ropped!
He was speech less.
I must tell you this...
Enoug h. I've Nothing to tell you.
Please...
He d ied at home. As he wanted to.
G uess they' re reconci I ing.
Too bad, she's a nice g i rl.
Y eah...
Wel l, tell her I said good-bye.
Bye, fel las.
your ham!
right. Thanks.
Hard ly cabin I uggage...
When my parents d ied, he raised me.
I know. But he had a good life.
- Stop that!
- Darl ing...
in that area, we always d id fine.
It' I l relax you.
You're a pig!
Sh it!
My contact lens!
Rem i, why head back to Paris?
My cousin has land for sale.
And a stone cottage.
Stop, Dou me!
right there!
Lea?
Why d id you leave so fast?
Looked like you two were making up...
Make up? With that jerk?
He came to tell me
my g rand pa Just d ied. That's all.
I'm so sorry. My condolences.
Thanks.
Have a nice tri p home.
Where are you headed?
up to the village.
To see h i m one last ti me.
I'll get my car at the hotel.
The hotells that way!
I g rew up here.
When there's snow,
it's cuToff from the world.
Now, only the old people are left.
- l' I l leave you.
- Wait!
If I don't introd uce you,
they' I l th in k l' m ashamed of them.
Wel l...
That's Fiorina, my cousin.
H i, Fiorina.
I'll be in the way.
this is a fam i ly affai r.
She is a bit invasive, but adorable.
Very tenacious.
right, Fiorina,
now we've met and...
Come, Fiorina. Let go of h i m.
He died as he wanted to.
That's best, Grandma.
- You came with someone.
- Yes.
this is Rem i. A friend.
Josepha, my g rand mother.
My condolences, Madame.
Mom!
My darl ings!
San pierro and An na-Maria. My kids.
I gathered that. H i, kids!
Hi, sir.
The village is being repopulated. Good!
I'm glad you found someone.
There's a misunderstanding...
Say nothing. I couldn't bring
a stranger to the funeral.
For her, We're an item.
OK, but what about
the kids' father? Is it Mateo?
No, Their dad is dead.
Good.
I mean...they don't look like Mateo.
They' re blond,
and Mateo's a strange color.
You may kiss h i m, too.
- Me?
- Yes.
It's the custom.
He doesn't know you.
T el I h i m who you are.
Go on.
T el I h i m.
Wel l...
My name is Rem i Francois...
I was born May 8, 1 953...
at a hospital,
Saint Fel icity, in Com pieg ne.
And... I I ive on...
a q u iet I ittle street... in Paris...
And your marital status?
Bachelor. No kids.
T el I h i m how you met Mom.
At the beach.
She was swi m m ing and...
She had a cram p...
Did you save her I ife?
in a way...
See, G rand pa,
she met a good man.
Is she having an attack?
It's a bit stuffy in here.
We don't need two stiffs.
Actually, I don't know
what l' m doing here.
It's del icious!
Li ke veal, but more tender.
It's rat!
No, San pierro.
It's a kind of hedgehog.
I'll do the d ishes.
No man ever d id the d ishes
in this house.
Time for a first...
My respects, Minister.
Are they mad at us?
My transfer to a d u I l su bu rb
is only hours away.
I have a scoop!
An old villager came to town
to buy a su it.
Who cares, Bald ucci!
Was it a two-piece? What color?
Black.
It's for Leoni's dad's fu neral.
What? He's dead?
- You knew h i m, Ch ief?
- No!
But Ange Leoni will be at the fu neral.
He's a Corsican. He has to.
Do I call Secu rity for backup?
No way! We go it alone on this!
- You OK?
- T errific.
I Just got engaged,
I have two ch i ld ren,
I'm watch ing over a dead man
inever knew.
And to top it all,
I've eaten rat.
Thanks...
for All You're doing for me.
OK, but...
this is a bit si I ly.
I can't spend the night
on this chai r.
What's bothering you?
Spend ing a night with me?
No. With h i m.
I'm so g lad You're here.
Behave!
What are you doing here?
It's my home.
Ready to move in!
After the ceremony.
We respect the fam i ly's g rief.
Lea's right.
You can't stay here.
They' I l g rab you.
Not to be at his bu rial...
You came, that's enoug h.
They' I l handcuff you in the cemetery!
OK.
Then let's leave now.
No, l' m staying.
only you can d rive h i m down.
Why? Others here have
a d river's I icense!
But no one' I l leave today.
Except a main ie.
A what?
A main lander.
Yesterday, I was
the wh ite hope of the fam i ly,
today l' m Just your cabd river!
Rem i, he's my brother!
Li ke you asked, Lea,
I got bread and cheese for them.
Let's go, boys.
Leoni! There's a road block!
Ange! Can you hear me?
Whatever you do, don't move!
Gentlemen.
You're sti I l here?
So d id you find Leoni?
his g randfather d ied.
I thought he'd be
in the village. He's not.
Whose car is this?
Lea's. Mr Leoni's sister.
Really... Lea... his sister...
Yes, I sociAllzed with the fam i ly.
They asked me
to go get more flowers.
Flowers...
I mean wreaths.
They' re g rieving, I cou ld n't say no.
You're very considerate.
Yes, who wou ld n't be right now?
Sti I l, open up your trunk.
And tell main landers we do our job.
I always say you do a g reat job.
And here, th ings aren't easy for you.
One must ad m it...
The trunk, please.
The trunk...
Sure.
Lower your g u ns!
I'm Secu rity! Leoni's ours!
Hands on the roof!
No, this witness is ours!
We nabbed h i m first!
OK, but what's in the trunk is ours!
T ake it all.
We' I l interrogate h i m!
Usually, the local cops get me.
right! You may d rive on.
Thanks, Captain.
I'll fasten my belt.
I'll report you, you wait and see!
Report what you want!
You don't make the laws arou nd here!
Know where You're headed?
Di recting traffic in town!
this isn't your tu rf!
- What?
- It's not your tu rf!
Who do you th in k you are!
The 2. 1 0 PM fl ig ht
is perfect, M iss Breche.
Of course, I found h i m.
How?
Yes, he was happy. I'll explain.
See if there's a later plane.
Over and out.
How d id you get here?
I know my way rou nd my cou ntry!
You, too!
I don't want your scams
to land me in jai l.
We welcomed you,
now you insu It me.
Drive!
- It's crawl ing with cops!
- Don't worry.
They' re checking the village.
You th in k everyone else is an id iot!
Drive, I said!
Leoni's with the g u mshoe!
Stay on Their tai l!
Godam m it!
Wasn'Tour fau lt!
Get as close as you can!
Bald ucci, go look! G rappa, get hel p!
It's really h ig h!
Weren't you a paratrooper?
Sh it! They can't be far!
Get going, step on it!
Hey, how do I get back?
Where we going?
The less you know, the better!
The less I know... Sh it!
You OK?
Li ke someone
who j u m ped from a moving car!
I'll take the stin ky cheese.
Then I q u it!
- Where' I l you go?
- Home! To Paris!
Rain, parking tickets, dogsh it,
I m iss All that!
You sick of I ife, or what?
Everyone knows We're a team.
The separatists and the cops
want you! Th in k iTover!
I'll tell the cops
l' m no parTof it!
They' I l th row the book at you!
You'll take the rap, not me!
You're not Corsican,
You're the ideal patsy.
They' I l tan your h ide, d ude.
What's the sol ution?
Look at the landscape!
Look!
- I m pressive, right?
- OK, I saw it.
We h ide a year, ti I l it blows over.
A year? No way! I have expenses!
It's best, You'll see.
I'll even carry the basket.
I have a com pany.
I ru n a business!
I can't pack it All in!
Come along.
What's the rush?
Does your detective agency pay?
I can't com plain.
You don't look like a ski rt-chaser.
But do you love Lea?
It's only Just starting.
A love story, but it's Just starting.
You got 3 seconds! Yes or no?
I'd say yes.
And our cheese? Isn't it good?
I'd rather eat it than smel I it.
It's a gem, I told you.
But it needs work.
Now Papa is dead,
I in herit more of the sheepfold,
wh ich means I can outvote
the other Leonis,
who are after the part I al ready had.
Is this shack so val uable?
That's not it.
It's a matter of princi ple.
Yes, I'd do the same.
Please don't smoke in here.
We've been spotted.
They' re smoking us out!
You see evi I everywhere.
It's an age-old practice.
Shepherds set fi re to Their land,
so the g rass g rows for Their herds.
If it's ecolog ical, that's OK.
It's pol ice brutAllty!
What if we su rrendered?
I meant me.
And d ishonor our fam i ly?
Of course not.
this' I l end bad ly.
I've had it to here!
Darl ing, come look.
Isn't that Leoni
in fronTof Borg nol i's place?
Ange!
Cal m down, Santou. I'm with a friend.
We have the cops on our ass.
You stole from us! H u m i I iated us!
Let's leave, Ange...
Come into my home.
Got anything to eat? We're starving.
Hand me my cell phone.
What's going on?
Never m ind. Cook us pulenta.
You're the detective they All want?
Even ing, Madame.
You broug ht a cop into my house?
Don't, he's my brother-in-law!
You're his brother-in-law?
So to speak...
Don't fight, or I won't make d inner.
That was g rand!
calls for a brandy and a cigar!
Rem i, pour me more coffee.
What do we now?
We' I l go to bed.
I meant, how do we geTouTof here?
I've had it.
Once the cops get ti red,
Santou takes us to the port,
Iends us his boat
and we spl it to Sard in ia.
It's a twin 250 h p.
G uzzles lots of gas.
Yes, but...
We' I l pay you.
How much you goTon you?
What?
On you!
Leoni!
Leoni!
Come out with your hands up!
Obey, or it' I l be a blood bath!
Then let blood flow!
Did you sn itch on me?
You insu It me in my home?
Then, it was you.
How? inever left the table!
Fin ish your pulenta, Mr Rem i?
Don't shoot, Leoni!
We've got your sister!
We al ready lost G rand pa, Ange!
Stop it! Not today!
The scu m g rabbed Lea!
No...?
Let a Corsican senator med iate!
call Pruzzati!
Not a chance!
I've got a hostage!
Who?
- You, you id iot!
- No!
Then they can't say
You're my accom pl ice!
For once, that's not so d u m b!
It's me!
I'm the hostage!
Ange, he's not to blame!
Let h i m go,
or You're not my brother!
No way! You have half an hour!
Then l' I l ki I l h i m!
That sou nded real.
He's a hothead, Senator Pruzzati.
But I want h i m Allve!
Don't worry,
I know the fam i ly. Just be fi rm.
But no Ram bo stu nts.
W e' re low on coffee.
- How are your kids, Borg nol i?
- Fine.
Learn ing Corsican from my dad.
A I iq ueu r, Mr Pruzzati?
Don't m ind if I do.
So Leoni, what do you want?
I want a fai r trial.
I'm the victi m of a plot.
I'll defend myself.
I trusTour legal system.
What's All this? If you get cute,
my boys will pick you off.
Easy, Com m issioner.
I heard the voice
of a reasonable man.
Mr Leoni's req uest
is q u ite leg iti mate.
I ag ree.
Leg iti mate.
The money they say I took,
where was it from?
For whom? To what end?
I, too, have a right to know.
About the bom b that destroyed
your restau rant, you said :
"Leoni's beh ind this... "
When two bu rly cops beat you,
you say anything so they' I l stop.
It was the fau ITof Moktar, my cook.
He left a cigarette
beside the gas can ister.
You stated that Mr Leoni
handed you a su itcase.
I meant Demetri us Leoni. Ange's father.
A saintly man.
It was fu I l of clothes
for the Red Cross.
You ad m itted receiving
a sum of cash from Mr Leoni.
It was only arou nd 200 Eu ros.
He boug ht me a sideboard
at a local flea market,
in the village where I was born.
I swear.
Kid napped and th reatened by Mr Leoni,
but you d id n't press charges.
Fascination for your captor,
or Mafia-type presSure?
Neither, sir.
These events
have been over-d ramatized.
I hear you married
Mr Leoni's sister last week.
You're his brother-in-law.
That's correct, your Honor.
Who investigated this case?
Now fam i ly mem bers have to testify?
I was told to come, so I came.
To hel p Justice...
After a 2-day trial,
the case against Ange was dropped.
Ange always landed
on his feet... or other people 's.
He got that guy's
restaurants for a song.
They needed work.
The guy's wife, it seems,
wanted a change of air.
Now I was parTof the family.
Ange was 1 00% beh ind me.
I worked for h im 1 4 hours a day.
The resta urant bus iness
is hard work.
Wh at i s it, my I ove?
in eed a tabl e for ei g ht.
For th e Bel g i ans on the big yacht.
Cousins of the Royal fam i ly.
W e' re fu I l. They shou ld've booked.
Rem i, swallow your pride.
Get the staff's table
from the kitchen.
I'm the jack of All trades, here!
Please, darl ing.
- I can't refuse you anything.
- Thanks.
OK, you can come over. Bye.
My sister has character.
So they say.
- Ru ns in the fam i ly.
- T rue...
Look!
Isn't that Pierre G ri mald i?
Maybe. I don't know h i m.
If he comes in, say We're closed.
Why closed?
I'll tell you some day...
"The Corsican File... "
It's a movie
with Reno and Clavier.
They need...
extras. You interested?
It' I l be a howl!
A movie about Corsica.
- "Corsican File".
- What fi le?
A secret fi le?
I wonder what's in it.
It's one view of Corsica...
A bit spiced up...
It's fu n.
To make it entertain ing,
you have to exaggerate...
But we are a bit like that...
OK, they made fu n of us...
But you can't hel p laug h ing.
Laug hter is parTof I ife.
The best part.
It's "Asterix in Corsica"!
It's a caricatu re but...
There's fewer Romans in it.
H i, Mom!
One more rehearsal!
"Bastia's a team of goats! "
I can't say that!
Corsicans are like others,
but d ifferent.
- What d id you say?
- Crap!
A Corsican sm i le?
So let me ask you :
"Can one make fu n of Corsicans?"
Yes, but don't do it!
