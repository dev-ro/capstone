little over-anxious...
and flogs some machines to a

got to eat shit...
and start plugging my
machines to other clubs.
As far as I'm concerned, that's it.
Apparently not.

offended get the idea...
that it would be a good thing to
take over the whole of my outfit.
So I'm worried.
I can't fight them. I don't
have that sort of a setup.

before they fix me.

Stand up. Stand up.

I'll bet you could use a drink.
Couldn't you, Eric, eh?
Have a drink.
- You've still got your sense of humor.
- Drink up.
Drink up. Drink up.
<font color="#808080">(GRUNTS)</font>
I want you to drink all of that.
Do you understand? Drink it all.
Just like it was with
my brother Frank.
Go on.
Drink up.
<font color="#808080">(COUGHING)</font>
Drink up, Eric.
It was you.
It was you who poured
it down him, wasn't it?
Eh, Eric? What? What? Eh?
<font color="#808080">(GRUNTING)</font>
Did you all have a good laugh, eh?
Did you have a good laugh when
he was spewing it up, eh?
Drink up. Drink it. Drink it!
Did you pass the bottle around when
the car went over the top? Eh?
Goodbye, Eric!
