Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, Daddy.
You don't have to pick me up.
I can find a ride.
Yeah, I know, that's what worries me,
What is a that on the back
of your hand, Caitlin Maguire?
Relax, Dad.
It's henna, okay?
Padma's mom did it for the girls in
class. We're studying Indian culture.
Indian culture.
It washes off, right?
Sort of. It will wear off.
I got this.
The girl at the store said
they were the best ones.
Yee. Thank you, Dad.
You know I gonna ...I don't
take the SATS until next year?
It's never too early
to start preparing, right?
Oh hey, can we stop at the
store for a couple of snacks?
.... Mikey goes to work.
So Mikey has a job, huh?
Yeah, not all growing up at
my school are snobs, Dad.
Mikey 's on scholarship and
he washes dishes at "Denny's".
Have you finished with your term paper?
- Totally.
- Totally?
Alright. It's almost done.
I have to prove that, ...?
I want that paper done before
your 2 little buddies come over
otherwise you'll never finish.
Alea iacta est.
What?
The die is cast.
This is from Julius Caesar.
You know that thing I've been
working on for the past six weeks.
The die is cast.
It's impressive.
You got the date locked?
Next Saturday.
Caitlin's gonna love it.
The band is booked.
Got the whole place to herself.
Good.
Caitlin is sweet sixteen
Damn, makes me feel old!
What we gonna do with the booze?
Don't worry about it.
Some of the bartenders
and the waitresses no dos.
- Not a drop,
- Ok.
Did you talk to the doormen?
No Meth at the door?
- Your doorman sell meth?
- Don't worry about it.
If I hear of anyone even
looking at Caitlin's friends funny,
I'll kick their asses myself.
No, wait a minute!
These are sixteen year old kids.
Kane, I do not want any incidents?
About sixteen rolls
drinking and doing drugs.
Like we are role models!
How much trouble did we use
to get into when we are their age?
I seem to remember you
double dipped in Betsy over
the one with the crazy eyes.
That's right! Yeah!
And wasn't she your girl for a while?
She was for a while, I'm so fond of
these butt asses knocking
his bun door out.
Well, hey. We share this
same honey pot, right?
- It makes us milk brothers.
- Romulus and Remus.
This is what I don't understand.
How would you
remember who you bang
when you've been drinking a fifth of
Scotch a day since you were born?
If you had a dad as
mean as mine you would.
I'm gonna throw a great party.
You're a great dad.
I got to run.
Take it easy, Paulie.
Now Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!
Can you please tell us how many jobs
will be provided on this project?
Yes. Phase 1 has already
created more than a 100 jobs
local jobs for this community.
And today we begin Phase 2.
Phase 2 means that we'll have a Park
- as well as a river walk ...
- Mr. Maguire!
What do you intend
to do with the profits?
Well, thank you, Frank.
The Mayor and I feel
that this project will
certainly stimulates
the economy and
we intend to put the money back into
education and medical. Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.
Hey, are you almost ready?
We're gonna be late for dinner with
the Thompsons and Dean White.
What does Dean White do exactly?
He works for the governor.
I think he's gonna
run for State Controller.
Good guy to know.
Yeah, we need a few extra contacts.
Do you prefer the .... or Portofino?
Noir.
You know Princeton's nearly 40,000 a year?
And that's not including room and board!
I know. Can we swing it?
I got it covered.
We've got it covered.
We're team here, right?
Yes.
We are a team. But she's..
No, no buts! None of this
"She's my daughter" bullshit, alright?
I love the two of you and I'm
here for you both, you got it?
You know, you're very sexy
when you put me in my place.
Is this you changing the subject?
I don't think we have time for this.
You are such a tease.
Well, I got to check on little hellion?
Caitlin, you going to be
staying home tonight, right?
Yeah, we're just hanging out here.
Good.  Because you have a lot of
homework that needs to be done by Monday.
- And you need to focus on your work.
- Okay, dad.
I'm serious.
Dad, I know. Listen.
We just gonna hang out here.
Watch TV or something.
Lisa might stop by,
but that is it.
Michael, I hear you're working now?
- Yes, sir.
- And how is that working out for you?
Sucks.
But it's nice, doing a bucket in
2 minutes pretty flexible, you know.
This summer if you want to make
some real money you let me know,
I can put you on one of my crews.
Swinging a hammer pays a hell of a
lot more than working at "Denny's".
Would you do that for me?
Yeah, if you give me a hand with
one of these boxes over here.
Sure, I'm coming.
Yeah.
So, you're gonna
ask my daughter out.
What?
I see the way you look at her.
I didn't think you'll
let her go out, you know.
- Do you smoke weed?
- No.
- No drug at all?
- No.
Well, then I might be willing to
make an exception for a working man.
You didn't think she would say "yes"?
The mind of a woman
is a mysterious thing.
I can't tell you what to say but ...
fortunately there's the bold.
Are we ready?
Yeah almost. Go, start the car.
I'll be right there.
Caitlin, I'm not your mother.
I'm not going to
lecture you about smoking,
although you
shouldn't be smoking.
But the last time you
and your friends hang out
Paul found cigarette
butts in the backyard,
and I took the heat for it.
He believed you?
Probably not.
But that's not the point.
- The look he gave me...
- I know the look.
- So you understand?
- Yeah.
Yeah, Vanessa. I'll be good.
I promise.
Thank you.
You guys have a good night.
She is so hot.
Dickhead!
I think the document
is perfect for us to build.
That part of town is just
screaming for development.
Huh, I hear a lot going
on in redevelopment.
How did you get started in
the business, Mr Maguire?
Oh, it's getting late.
It's already past midnight.
I'm sure we'd like to go
home and get some rest.
Paul doesn't like to brag,
but the truth of the matter is he
built his first development himself.
- A lot of hard work.
- That's what I've heard.
Well, I had a full crew,
as a matter of fact, yeah.
My first job was swinging hammer,
tend to drive my
foreman all crazy, but
there is nothing that satisfies
like an honest days work.
I love guy that's not afraid to roll
his sleeves up and get his hands dirty.
Here's to an honest days work!
An honest days work.
Their coming
to get you, Barbara!
Stop it!
Hey, my dad kind of likes you.
It's funny.
Yeah. Mike go work for the
big guy, dangle with the family.
Next thing you know,
you're marrying Caitlin,
taken over the business.
You'll be made head in no time.
Cut it out, man!
Detective.
Are you here for dinner?
- Paul, we need to talk.
- What seems to be the problem?
- I'm sorry, but it's urgent.
- This is not the time or the place.
Whatever this is, surely we
can discuss it in the morning.
Hey Paul, listen to me.
This is not about you.
It's about Caitlin.
They called it in
in about an hour ago.
Michael and the
other little boy Evan.
We sent him to the hospital
and got him a sedative.
He was really shaken up.
What this Michael kid told us
was that all three of them
were together when it happened.
Been playing video games,
had a few drinks.
They said that Caitlin
tried to get away.
They said that she
put up a hell of a fight.
This can't be happening.
What about the neighbors?
Did they see anything?
No. Nothing.
I mean, who would break into
your house, grab your daughter?
There's no ransom demands?
Nothing.
I don't know. I don't have any
problems with anyone, right now.
Right now. But
think about your past.
Who would have the
inclination to do this?
I know you still talk to O'Connell.
This is my daughter!
I would tell you, if I had
any idea who is behind this.
Would you?
Pete, I'm out of the game!
You know that.
- How long have we known each other?
- Since the massacre at the Four P's...
- Yes, fifteen years, Pete.
- Yeah, I know you.
Right, you do.
You know me.
I just don't want you falling back
on any of your old habits.
Let us handle this
our way, all right, Paul?
Okay fine.
What's your way?
Oh, we drop it on
the news right away.
- With an emphasis on your history.
- Great!
How many times do we have
to tell you that he's clean?
One or two things is going down here.
The kidnappers either
know you or they don't.
If they don't, then the fear of just who
they are messing with is of this essence.
Once they hear, they'll
probably drop her off at
a gas station somewhere and
she's back by lunch tomorrow.
And if they know me?
They'll be in contact
and we'll be there.
We have a tap on your phone.
Either myself or Detective
Hansen will be here at all times.
Paul, we'll find her.
You'd better.
Why, Paul?
Why Caitlin?
- What you going to do?
- You too?
I'm sorry
- I just...
- If I had any idea
who did this...
Just one.
You'll find her.
Do what you have to do.
Whatever it takes.
You just bring her home.
The two unidentified male classmates
who are injured in that home invasion,
they're expected
to make a full recovery.
Caitlin Maguire is
5'6", 105 pounds,
long brown hair and blue eyes.
If you have any information
that can help in the investigation
and search for Caitlin,
call right .........
Move, let's go!
Come on, Danny, go!
- I got to go out.
- Go out?
I can't just sit here waiting for
the phone to ring knowing
she's out there somewhere, scared...
And I'm suppose to
stay here all by myself?
There's cops all over the house.
That's not what I meant.
Please!
Be safe, okay?
Where are we off to?
Hey!
It'd be best if you just
stay here by phone, okay?
Shouldn't you be out
somewhere looking for my daughter?
- We're doing everything we can
- So am I.
Paul!
I'm so sorry.
Eleanor. Please.
I need to speak with your son?
Wow!
Look at all these awards.
You know, I started dating
Mary when I was seventeen.
That was Caitlin's mom, Mary.
You're seventeen, right?
Yeah.
I remember once we were on
this day down by the shore.
Summer time.
Hot as shit.
Just wouldn't cool off.
Anyway, this Puerto Rican looking
shithead comes walking down the beach
and calls Mary a slut.
Believe that shit?
What a nice, Irish, Catholic
girl like that a slut, well.
Needless to say,
I had to defend her honour.
Because that's what gentlemen do.
To protect women.
So when I got the tyre iron out the
trunk of my car, I broke both his legs.
I'm not like that any more.
No, I've changed.
Thing is, when Mary got ...
stage 4 breast cancer...
swore I'd go legit, so
there'll always at least one ...
... one parent around
to take care of Caitlin.
But they had guns!
I would expect you to get
shot trying to protect her!
Now, I want you to think hard.
What did they sound like?
What?
The kidnappers.
Did they  have an accent?
Did they sound Russian?
Puerto Rican?
Did they use any word slang?
Did they sound like Greenboss?
I don't know.
What did they smell like?
Spicy food, too much cologne?
Come on, Mike.
You've got to give me something.
If anything
happens to my daughter,
I'm holding you
personally responsible.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.  I don't know.
It was all so fast,
messed up, you know?
I wish I could
have done something.
I wish I had been brave.
I wish it was me, okay?
If you remember anything,
you give me a call.  Got it?
Yes, sir.
Yeah it's me.  I need some help.
Can you meet me at the construction site?
We're sorry.
We'll find the squirrels
who did this, Paulie.
You got my word on it.
I know you're still in
with O'Connell, right?
- Yup.
- Right.
Remember the stint I
pulled inside not too long ago?
Did my time, kept my
mouth shut. Bought me out.
I need guys I can trust.
Cops are keeping
very close tabs on me, so
I understand if don't want
to get involved with this but I ...
I ... do need some help.
Say the word.
I want to find her.
I want to find who took her and ...
They're dead, Paulie.
They just don't know yet, right?
Here's 200,000.
Use what you need
to get any information.
You just keep the rest, ok?
We can't take that.
We're family.
You'd do the same
thing for us, Paulie.
- We'd do anything you're asking.
- I know.
This could get dirty.   Just
how deep you want us to go?
How deep is hell?
I know just where to look.
This guy's a rat and he knows me.
Just hang back,
I'm pulling my lever, eh.
Jesus, know that it would be nice.
Knock, knock, asshole!
Oh, shit!
Hey, hey, let me go!
No, no, no, no.
I didn't steal anything, man!
Come on, I swear. You know I
won't mess with you right?  Come on.
Relax, relax.
I know you wouldn't do that,
alright.  You're too smart for that.
I got one question
to ask you, alright?
Who kidnapped Paul Maguire's daughter?
Take a good look.
You heard anything?
Nothing. I swear.
If I know, I would tell you.
And who would mess
with Maguire, anyway?
Hold still!
My, my, my.
I'm not happy with
what I see here, Oliver.
Hoped that you were a sweet little beau,
huh, before he got you all jacked up.
Come here, now.
Come here.
That's it.
Easy now.
Well, just put her down!
Put her down.
- What are you doing?
- Come on, my little princess.
Am I your little princess?
And I have a pretty little
princess necklace here for you, too.
You don't know anything
about the girl, Oliver?
- There's nothing, I swear!
- Start talking, Oliver!
Please look!  Whatever it is you're
about to do.  Don't.  Please don't.  No.
Tell me about the girl, Oliver.
Look, please.  If I knew,
I would tell you! Come on, man!
Please don't!
No, no! No, Doherty!
Listen to me.
Is there a girl being
held somewhere?
I don't know. I don't know!
A lot of things, tell him, I don't know!
- No, no, no, no!
- Talk to me, Oliver!
No, please! Don't!
- I love her. ....!
- What was that?
I love her, man!
No, no, no, no!
Lisa, come here.
I need you to breathe.
Now I believe you.
See you around, Oliver.
Jesus, I can't believe I hit that rope!
What, you never done that shit before?
Hell, no. I thought for sure she
was going for a 2 storey swan dive.
- You're one horrible guy!
- You're right. You're a saint, huh?
Nobody seen or heard
at least something.
How is that possible?
Paul, we've been
rallying jaws all night long.
Whoever took her
is keeping the shit tight.
Got feelers out everywhere.
Somewhere, someone has to mess up.
All right
Paul...
We found her.
Thank you for your beautiful song.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
- Thank you for coming.
So sorry, my friend.
Vanessa, this
is Francis O'Connell.
Hi, I'm Vanessa, Paul's wife.
- Pleased to meet you
- Call me Frank.
You don't mind,
Frank, I have ...
some things I'd like
to attend to, at the house.
I'll see you later.
Can we talk a walk?
You've done really
good for yourself, Paulie.
I'm proud of you.
Smoking mirrors, Francis.
That's not what I heard.
You've got a nice, big house over
there by the Country Club, eh?
And a beautiful wife.
You know, Paul, the
present situation aside,
you've got yourself one hell
of a life, don't you agree?
This going somewhere?
Things have settled down.
The business is more
civilized than it used to be.
In the good old days, you remember?
The gutters were running red, huh.
You remember the night at the "Four Ps"?
And what those
Russian faggots did to me.
Of course.
But do you remember what I told you,
because you wanted
to rush in and kill them all?
- You simply lost too many already.
- Exactly.
I don't know what this
has to do with anything.
My neck. It's hurting to
look up to you like this.
Do you mind sitting down?
That's better.
Eye to eye.
That's the thing
I miss the most, I guess.
To be able to stand over
somebody and stare 'em down.
Those simple, small things in life
that I'm not able to do anymore.
You know, like
banging a young broad,
or kicking somebody's
teeth down their throat.
But do I lash out, Paulie?
Do I show my weakness?
No.
I buried it a long time ago.
I buried the heart.
Just like you, I have to bury you.
Hey, I'm not finished!
Sit down!
You were saying.
Yeah. You better be listening.
Because I know you.
I know this
unpleasantness is eating at you.
And you're determined
to do something about it.
I'm asking you. Don't.
Let the cops do their job.
Things are good.
I want them to stay that way.
Right?
Things don't look so good
from where I am, Francis.
If you won't listen to reason,
can you listen to a friend?
I did you a big favour
when I let you walk out.
I didn't have to, you
know that.  But I did.
I let you walk out.
It's not everyday someone can
just walk out of the business,
clean as you could.
But you could.
You know why?
Because you came to
me and you asked me.
I did you a favour,
and now I want
to repay me by doing nothing.
Let it go away, Paulie.
Bury the hurt.
You understand me.
Yeah.
I understand you.
Here's some ... anybody want cream?
- No, thank you.
- I'm good.
Your friend Sheila still come around?
I don't know what I'm
going to do with all food.
So...
Honey, do you mind?
I want to know.
No, really you don't.
Hey.
- She's a pizza, wife of yours.
- So what's the word?
No word.
O'Connell not only said to stay out
of it but to keep an eye on you too.
So what now?
Do you still have someone inside the force,
someone who won't report back to your boss?
I do.
I am checking the case.
I didn't want to bring this up because ...
- we're not supposed to bring it up.
- No, no, no.
It was long time ago.
We did everything right.
Are you sure?
- Drive, drive, Danny!
- Go, go, go!
- Where is the key?
- Where is the key?
- Without the key ...!
- No, no!
- No!
- What you have done.
- Give me the gun.
- Nai, nai, nai, yai!
This is your mess.
You clean it up.
No. We did everything right.
Jesus.
Tell me about it.
How is it that a man with
this many past criminal associations
can turn legitimate businessman
and I can't get a refile I'm working in.
I mean, look at this!
Irish mob, Russian mob.
Got 20 suspects,
and no leads.
When have you ever known
a criminal that just go clean?
No arrest doesn't mean no activity.
Maybe he's just being careful.
No, I've just talked with
him a few days ago. He's a wreck.
If he were still dirty,
he'd know who did this.
This might help narrow
down the suspect list.
The ballistics from the Maguire girl.
A 7.62 mm.  Fired from
a Soviet made Tokarev TT-33.
Only gets worse.
It crossed against three hits
tied to the Chernov family.
One in 1983, and two in 1988
What does that tell you?
That whoever killed ...
hadn't killed anyone,
a long damn time.
At least not with that gun.
This stays here?
Mr. Maguire.
I'm really very sorry for your loss.
Caitlin was ...
She was really something else.
She was.
She worked really hard on that
and I just thought that ...
Of course.
I'll read it tonight.
Mr. Maguire.
Would you like to collect
Caitlin's belongings in her locker?
Are you sure it's Chernov?
No, I'm not sure.
Whoever did it,
he had a Russian gun.
It's 20 years ago.
How could they know about us?
How?
They took his daughter.
You think that's coincidence?
Very well.
I never talked.
And you never talked.
And I'm certain Paul never talked.
So how would anybody know?
Some ass just stinks.
You want me to tell him?
No, I'll do it.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Is he in?
Maybe he'll talk to you.
Are you okay?
Fine.
I know it's hard.
Just because she wasn't my blood,
doesn't mean she wasn't
my daughter, you know?
She loved you,
Thank you.
Stay strong.
He's upstairs.
Hey.
This was when she was four.
What have you heard?
- Ballistics.
- Yes?
Want to get out of here?
So what does that mean exactly?
How someone like you got
as far as you did in the organization
without knowing its going?
Knives are quiet.
I like knives.
Tokarev.  TF 33.
It's an old army fusil.
HL Climp?
- And is favorite of the Russian mafia.
- Jesus!
Yeah. The Russians.
Could have been a hit.
Could have been a smaller faction
just looking for some ransom money.
Not one of them takes a shit
without Chernov's permission.
We never asked
permission to rob the Russians.
We don't talk about that.
Keep trying to get
Vanessa to stay
some place safe
but she won't listen.
She won't go.
So what do you want to do?
Call Danny.
Like old times, fellas.
Let's do this, huh!
You're not understanding us.
We have a lot of money to spend
and we want to play some cards.
Clearly you have a
problem understanding English.
We want to play cards.
Nyet. Private.
No. That is not what I said.
What I said is ....
we have a lot of money to spend
and we want to play some cards.
Okay, let us in.
Private.
Yes?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
We need you to move, partner!
Speak English!
I speak three languages.
How many do you speak,
stupid Americans?
We now got their attention.
- They're going to come gunning for us.
- Sure shit.
Always the best way to get
information when it's hard to come by.
You stir the pot and
they'll come looking for you.
- Just be ready.
- We'll be ready.
Danny. The shit's about to get
radical. You got to cover each other.
- Relax, alright? We got this.
- Not with your cocain parties.
Really? You got to go there, Paulie?
What is it with you
and my partying, anyway?
Alright, let's just relax, okay?
Alright?
Jesus, Paulie!
- What is this?
- You know exactly what this is.
It is not safe for
you to be here anymore.
Tell me what happened?
Please don't shut me out.
I want to know.
What?
What do you really want to know?
You want to know how many
people a I dragged up last night?
And how loud the screams were?
- No, I...
- Then, what?
Is it over?
Just beginning.
I'm not leaving.
I need you and you need me.
You told me to do,
whatever it takes, right?
Well, this is what it takes.
Pack your bags.
I was wrong. And I should
have kept my mouth shut.
But you didn't.
And now I'm in this.
Sorry to have upset you.
Yeah.
That upsets me.
My husband is a killer.
I think you're enjoying this.
Say "My husband is a killer."
Come on, repeat after me.
"My husband is a killer."
You've always known it.
Just haven't seen it, till now ..
Is that, is that what's going on?
Is that why you're still here,
because it turns you on?
I ..
- Anything?
- Nothing.
All right.
We up the stakes.
What are you thinking?
We need Avore.
I'm going to make a quick call.
Beautiful.
Yeah, just take him into the back room
and keep him occupied for us, sweetheart.
We'll be right over.
Yeah, me too. Easy now.
Amber has got Avore over at the club.
Just gonna take him
to the back room for us.
Just in case,
get backing.
Alright. All three of us go in here is
going to look suspicious as hell, alright.
So, you two sit tight. I'll go
and bring this prick out.
I got it Les.
Can't shoot people in the street.
You know who I am?
What? You are nothing to me.
Do you know me? Huh.
Nineteen years ago,
I threw you from a car
and stole your boss's money.
You were there?
In the mask.
Chernov thought
I took the money.
He tortured me
You're too late.
I lost these fingers because of you.
Someone put a bullet
in my daughter's head
With a Russian handgun.
Who did?  Huh.
Was it Chernov?
Or someone acting out a turn?
Who was it?
Who did it?
Who did it?
No, no, no, no! Don't die.
Don't, don't! Don't die!
Who did it?
Who did it?  Who did it?
Who did it?  Who did it?
A cup of coffee, please.
Thank you.
I'm here.
What do you want?
You can't go around tearing up the
city. This isn't good for you, anymore.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Listen, man. This isn't
going to bring your kid back.
I feel you, what
you're going through.
But if this keeps up,
I promise you, I'm going to find a way
to put you and your crew away for good.
Shit, Paul!
A few years ago, my kid Robbie
was riding his bike on
6th Street and got hit by a car.
I get to emergency.
It was touch and go.
Yeah.
Poor kid is in surgery.
I felt I needed to
do something, anything.
I found out where the guy lived.
I see his fender. Mangled.
Where he hit my boy.
I must have stood an hour
at the edge of the driveway
with a gun in my hand.
Finally I cooled myself down.
I go back to the hospital.
Robbie pulls through.
A few days later,
I went down to 6th Street.
There was construction going on.
There was a blind spot.
And I realized that moment
that that accident could
have happened to anyone.
If I had killed that man,
it wouldn't have changed a thing.
Your kid is still alive.
Anything else?
I'm coming, Bitch!
A moment!
You!
Put your weapon down.
On the floor now!
Down!
Okay,
Andrei!
Andrei!
Andrei!
You son of a ..
It's okay.
You'll be dead soon.
But first...
... you're gonna talk.
Somebody put one hell of a
dent to Chernov's drug operation.
Yeah, and I haven't
even started to think about
that mess at the Russian joint.
Six gold cross.
Chernov's men, huh?
Meet Sasha Barad.
Rap sheet as long as my dick.
Cutting off fingers?
Somebody is trying
to snip out a secret.
I have a pretty good idea who.
What is it?
Someone in the warehouse.
Victor and Sasha are dead.
Find whoever did this.
Then bring them directly to me.
What's this world coming to, huh?
When I was young man, we used
to settle our disputes with this.
Words were exchanged,
before gunshots.
People knew what was coming to them
and why.
These days, they shoot first.
There is no rationale, no protocol,
Nothing.
But blood and confusion.
How am I suppose to know
what these men wants?
Shit...
Hello?
An SUV on my street.
Big bunch of Russian guys
appears to have gotten out.
How long once
you and Doherty get over?
- I thought he was with you.
- No, Danny's not with me.
Make it fast.
Please hangup and try later...
Come on!
God damn it, Danny, pick up?
They got Kane!
Danny!
Go, go, go!
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Me. What the hell is wrong with you?
- Cuff him!
- Come on!
Get off him!
Are you trying to kill
everyone in this city? Look at me!
Go to hell!
What the hell is going on, Maguire?
This asshole let the
kidnappers get away.
I would like to ask you some questions
concerning your whereabouts last night?
I'm trying to help you
here. You got clean once.
Do it again.
Walk away.
Let us do our job.
We'll find who killed your
daughter.  I promise you, Paul.
- This is a top priority.
- Bullshit.
I know you heard
about the ballistic report.
Personally, a couple of
dead avore brightens my day.
So, why are they after you?
What did you do?
Did you piss someone off?
Can I go now?
Sir, are you serious!
- I'll take care of this.
- You gonna let him walk?
Thanks, Peter.
I owe you one.
Hey. Paul!
You watch your back, man.
Mr. Kane, you know,
who I am, don't you?
Not personally, no.
We've never met.
Real name is Chernov.
And you're the bad guy.
That is quite funny.
Coming from someone responsible
for the death of several of my men.
Can you offer me an explanation
for your behaviour?  Please.
Explanation. I should be
asking you the same thing.
Anton. Please.
Allow me to handle this.
Maybe a little water will
help loosen your tongue.
Drink up.
There.
I do not explain things.
Others will explain me.
I ask questions,
and you answer them, understand?
Yes, sexy. I like that.
- I told you to do that.
- Tell the stripper to leave, Danny.
- Paulie, what's up, buddy?
- Where were you, Danny?
Get out, take every stuff, get out.
What's up?
You didn't check your phone?
I'm just blowing off a
little steam with Amber.
Why aren't you at your house?
Because you don't bang
strippers in your home.
What's going on?
- They got Kane.
- Oh Jesus...
Cos you didn't answer your phone.
Yeah. I told you, I was having fun.
All this action, I couldn't wind
down, I needed a release.
While you were getting high,
and getting your dick wet
they got Kane.
Paulie, look.
Let me get you a drink right?
How is your bladder filling?
Full.
Why are you killing my men?
Why would you be so stupid, huh?
What could you possibly have to gain?
I can do it much longer than you can.
- Caitlin Maguire.
- Who?
You killed Caitlin Maguire. Paul
Maguire's daughter. That's the truth
The former criminal
who lost his daughter?
- He thinks I did it?
- He knows you did it.
That is a terrible accusation.
Why would I kill a little girl?
Why would I do such a thing?
She was killed with that
Russian gun. Tokarev.
You're not looking so good, Mr. Kane.
I can stop when you like.
Why?
Revenge.
We had the back burner,
for the money
We cut his hand off.
We killed him.
We were kids.
You killed Ivan?
You killed my brother?
You started this war.
Call that gimp O'Connell.
When was your stay?
Four years ago, I got out.
- You spent how long inside?
- What difference does it make?
Just answer the question.
How long?
Five years in an
eight years sentence.
Aggravated assault, possession.
Right. Yeah, I remember
when I went down.
All over the papers.
Crateful of Isreali submachine guns
and all you got was possession?
- Plea bargain.
- No!
And I don't like
what you're getting at.
What am I getting at?
Paulie...
No one here has one clue
who killed my daughter.
No one.
Threw up all those Russians last night
and not single one of them knew anything.
If they did they would have
cracked, so you tell me.
What am I getting at?
Paulie, I did not rat.
And you know I wouldn't rat.
It was the driver.
He didn't know shit!
Never saw our faces.
Never knew what hit him.
- Paulie, listen to me.
- But you shot him.
So now, we will never know.
Paulie, you got to listen to
me, right? Just listen to me.
The whole reason
I'm back with O'Connell?
Because I didn't drop
a dime on nobody.
I got a light rap because they
misplaced some of the evidence.
But still you went down nine
years ago, so that was what?
That was two or three
years after we split the cash.
Ok, so what are you getting at?
The weapons you got caught with.
Did you use the money to
buy them? And don't lie to me.
Yeah, of course I did.
What the hell?
What's the big deal?
What's the big deal?
That it took Caitlin and
they shot her in the head.
Maybe that's not a big deal to you.
But it's a pretty fucking big deal to me.
And the only reason
they would do something like
that is that someone talked.
No one asked you, where you
got the money for those guns?
O'Connell didn't want to know
how you managed to pull off
something like that on your own?
- Paulie!
- Yeah?
- I have always been loyal.
- You have always been an idiot!
Screw you, Paulie!
Nothings ever your fault.
It's always someone else to blame.
Always someone
there to bail you out.
Who's bailing you out now?
Whose man are you now?
Are you my man?
Are you Chernov's man?
Are you O'Connell's man?
Easy, Paulie. Easy.
Knock it off!
- You talked!
- I did not!
You just got to your boss.
They'd take care of you.
Make those guns go away.
That's lovely.
And then O'Connell talked.
And now my daughter is dead!
We swore not to talk about it,
not to spend the money, not to
draw attention to ourselves!
- I'm not a rat!
- You are a rat!
- Rat! Rat! Rat!
- Shut up!
You ... swore!
Paulie, shit, man!
I loved you.
And you swore.
Danny. Come on, Danny.
Danny!
You have to get up, Danny.
Get up, Danny!
Danny.
I'm with you, brother.
What is so damn important,
you have to pull me away from
my nephew's football game?
Anton.
I believe that belongs to you.
No. Hasn't been mine
for many, many years.
- I'm have no responsibility.
- Responsibility, huh?
When I was nineteen years old.
I was number one light
heavyweight champion in the
Soviet Olympic boxing team.
Did you know this?
No. I don't like sports.
And especially not Soviet sports.
I had a set of number one.
I could have been the champion
except my father
had a little problem.
He was an pathetic gambler.
He could no longer pay his debts.
And the Russian Mob, the Bratwa,
placed the burden on my shoulder.
I cleared his debt
by taking a fall by
losing to the champion.
What do you think I did?
- Well, I don't have a clue. Fill me in.
- Don't have a clue.
I took a beating for my father.
I lost for him.
No child should have
to pay for his father's sins.
But the Bratwa took me in.
They gave me new life.
When my father fell
for the debt again,
who do you think they sent to collect?
Me.
My father failed me.
Just as your man here failed you.
I told you he is not my man
any longer.  Are you deaf?
Do you know the Maguire
fellow, the one in the news.
The one whose
daughter has been killed...
What about him?
He was the one who killed my brother.
He was the one who
started the war between us.
The one who landed you in that chair.
So you see?
I invited you here to ask
you to do one thing for me.
Take responsibility.
Let me make one thing clear.
I don't take orders
from people like you.
Russian scumbag!
Do what you have to do.
Whatever it is.
It's Tokarev,
TT-33.
It's an old army fusil.
It's the favourite of
the Russian mafia.
Evan!
Evan!
What's so important?
I'm sorry, Mike.
What?
Sorry.
It was an accident...
No! Please!
I didn't mean to! Come on.
You have to believe me!
No. No, please.  Please, no.
Okay.
We were hanging out
and drinking as normal.
And talking about how
you used to be a gangster.
So where does he keep the loot?
Shut up!
Come on. How many times do
I have to tell you guys, my dad is a...
A legitimate businessman.
Yes.
Yeah. Has he ever been arrested?
Maybe you should ask
him when he gets home.
No. Honestly he kinds
of scares the shit out of me.
Pussy!
Have you ever seen
or heard anything?
Like secret phone calls
or why is it ....around.
- Wait. Did you see that?
- Totally!
- Did you see that?
- Come on! You know something.
Something cool!
Come on. Spill it.
Caitlin.  Please?
Alright.
Serious?
Yeah, I'll show you something.
Yes!
We went upstairs. She said she
had something cool to show us.
I've never held a
gun before, you know?
It was scary and cool and I know
I should've put it down.
But I didn't...
Take some of this, you whacko!
Evan, don't run.
Don't make me chase you!
- Come on, let's go!
- It's raining.
So what is rain.
We don't melt.
Okay. Come on, Evan
We got to put it back.
- No! It's not even loaded!
- Don't be an arsehole.
- Come on. Hand it over.
- Fine, party is killed.
Jesus, you too?
Alright, hand it over!
Oh God! No, no, no, no!
Is she dead?
No!
I didn't hear her coming.
I wasn't paying attention.
I was a little drunk and the
gun was so cool, you know.
And it felt ...
I didn't know she was
going to be right behind me!
I ..
It was an accident.
I didn't know what to do.
We dragged her into the woods.
We put the guns back.
We trashed the house the house to make
it seem like a home invasion I figured.
With your history ...
... the cops would think it
was a mob hit or something.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't want to kill her.
I was scared. I was scared!
I loved her.
I swear to God.
I loved her so much.
Please say something!
Please end this.
Please!
I can't take it anymore.
Please!
Baby.
Hi.
It's okay, now.
It's all over.
It's good to hear your voice.
Come home.
I know you'll be safe now.
Are you okay?
You sound so alone.
I killed a man, when I was seventeen.
Caitlin's age.
Got into a fight.
Someone handed me a knife.
Sometimes I dream about that night.
In the dream I see myself
and I try to stop it.
But I can't.
Then I wake up ...
and I wonder what
would have happened
if no one handed me that knife.
What my life ...
what our lives ...
- Might have been.
- Paul!
I am sorry I let you down.
Paul?
Paul!
