Nice.
Aren't you only
supposed to do that
right after you're married?
You're, like,
a year late.
Yeah, better safe
than sorry,
though, right?
If I tripped on the way in,
it'd probably bring
bad luck.
Wait, is that why
people do that?
Yeah.
- You should read less.
-     Thanks.
Excuse me.
Does this, 
 like, go upstairs?
Easy, easy, easy.
We don't have
nearly enough stuff
to fill this place.
Then we'll get 
 more stuff.
This is going well.
Oh, yeah,
it's going great.
Hannah,
 your room's the last one
 on the right.
Come on, Monty.
This is our new room.
I don't blame you.
So?
Feels like I've gone
from house arrest
to solitary confinement.
Come on,
look on the bright side.
It's a lot bigger
than your old room.
Yeah. Feels too big.
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
you gotta picture your stuff
thrown all over the place.
Look at that.
Smaller already.
I don't think
Monty likes it.
Aw. Well, he will.
Takes time.
You realize that
we're locked into
a 30-year mortgage, right?
Yes, I am aware of
the mortgage.
Just saying that
if we wanted to wait
till all our stuff's moved in
before we start hanging
things on the wall,
we totally could.
I mean,
there's plenty of time.
I just want it
to feel like home
as quickly as possible,
especially for Hannah.
Mmm.
You know, it's not
pictures and furniture
that make a home, Mel.
It's the people
living in it.
Besides, I know you're only
hanging up this stuff
to get out of
actually carrying anything.
Get away from me.
I love you, Hannah.
This is
the last of it.
This goes
in the living room.
Oh, hey.
Twenty bucks,
that thing ends
up in the trash.
Okay, I hear you.
Hannah?
What do you think?
I think it would look
better in the corner.
That's what I thought,
but your dad thinks--
He's as far away from
an interior designer
as you get.
Help me push it back.
There we go.
Much better.
Whoa! Careful.
No.
Sounds like
your distributor.
What's that?
Distributor.
It's probably just
a loose wire.
Easy fix.
Well, I do like easy.
Easy means cheap.
Ray Walsh.
Hey. John Alexander.
Nice to meet you.
So, you're
the new neighbor.
Yup.
You mind?
Knock yourself out.
So, you're a locksmith?
In this economy?
That, and then some.
Why? You need something?
No, just the realtor suggested
we rekey all the locks, so...
There's something
about this neighborhood
we should know about?
No, no, no.
That's just common sense.
Never know
who's running around
with access to your place.
Say bye 
 to Hannah, Rachel.
Bye, Hannah. 
 I'm gonna miss you.
You're gonna miss her? 
 Good.
What's up, bro?
 Hannah! 
 You have a good one!
Miss you.
 Bye!
Bye. 
 We're gonna miss you.
We'll miss you 
 so much--
Couldn't help yourself, huh?
Sound of a bad engine's
like my Batsignal, Mel.
Can't just ignore it.
How's he seem? Nice?
Yeah, nice enough.
He's actually gonna rekey
our locks for us.
Oh.
First moving casualty, huh?
Loved that lamp.
Aw, that's a shame.
I know.
Hey, you got 20 bucks
on you?
Huh?
Let's roll!
It's better right here,
I promise.
You can't put it
in front of a vent.
It... There's...
Look, there's space
for ventilation to go--
It's right
in front of it, though.
Okay, but we don't have to...
Where are you, anyway?
It's the only room
I could find
a wireless signal.
I guess
it's gonna be the office.
Until it becomes a nursery.
Don't even joke about that.
I wasn't joking.
Wait, what?
Are you sure you're not
freaking out or anything?
About us? No.
No, we'll be fine.
But it's not like
 you're gonna find
a new boyfriend in suburbia--
Wait, wait.
Tommy, you're breaking up.
 And plus...
Shit.
First dinner
in the new house,
we gotta toast to that, right?
Really, Mel?
I'm fine with water.
No. See, you can't toast
with water.
It's bad luck.
This isn't, like...
A test, is it?
It's not a test.
It's a toast.
To us...
To family...
To home.
Who were you
talking to upstairs?
Tommy.
How's he doing?
I guess he's fine.
You know,
I think a little distance
will be good for both of you.
And I think
that you're wrong.
And I think you better--
 What's 
 Becky up to this summer?
Maybe after you've settled in,
she can come
visit for a few days.
Look, 
 we know how hard this is.
If there was
another way, we would--
There was another way.
I could have stayed
with any of my friends.
For the whole year?
Yes.
It's my senior year, Mel.
You really think
we're ready to
trust you again?
John.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
Leave that,
I'll take it to work.
I love you, Hannah.
Monty, it's okay.
Easy, Monty.
I think you should go
 a little easier on Hannah.
Easier on her?
She's a teenager, John.
Yeah, she's a teenager
who threw a party
that almost destroyed
our old house,
who got arrested
for underage drinking.
Oh, right.
Because you never drank
or went to parties
as a teenager.
Never got arrested.
Oh.
What are you doing?
I think you know
what I'm doing.
Um, I'm not really
feeling this shirt.
What? 
 This is my lucky shirt.
Stop.
Nice try, Dad.
Monty?
What are you doing
out there?
Dad! 
 What's the code?
1-0-6-1-8!
Are you all right?
Monty was outside.
So I opened the door.
I don't know how he got there.
That's probably
the alarm company.
I'll get it.
You guys go back
to bed.
Who ate
all the Chinese food?
I thought you said you guys
were gonna leave me some.
Oh, don't look at me.
Have you seen my keys?
Little nervous
for your first day
at the library, huh?
Books are books.
Ooh, have you seen my keys?
Yes. Spare's by
the front door.
Great. Thank you. Bye.
Hey, don't forget,
Ray's coming over
for the locks.
You're not the only one
that drinks milk,
you know.
It's fine. We're family.
Have you seen Monty?
Nope.
He'll show up.
He's probably just getting
acquainted with
the neighborhood.
Hey, come with me
for a second.
What?
Did you get me a new car?
Not exactly.
What is all this stuff?
Previous owners walked away
from their mortgage,
so we had to buy
the place as is.
I guess this is what
they meant by "as is."
Okay. But what does this
have to do with me?
Well, since you're grounded
for the next two months,
I thought I would give you
something to do.
Tell you what,
so it's not all bad.
You can keep anything in here
you think is valuable.
Aw. Gee, thanks.
Gotta go.
Hey, think fast.
Shit.
That's the new neighbor.
- Let's go say hi.
- She's staring.
- Let's get out of here.
- Go, go. Go.
So that just happened.
Ms. Alexander?
I didn't mean to scare you.
No, no, you didn't.
I just...
I completely forgot
you were coming over.
Well, you got a lot
on your plate.
Tell you what,
don't mind me.
I'll be out of your hair
in just a bit.
Any juicy neighborhood gossip
we should know about, Ray?
You know,
I couldn't tell you
if there was.
Of course, I work all day,
and my wife is pretty shy
when it comes to socializing.
You know, I did wanna
mention these locks.
Cheap and ineffective.
Somebody who knows
what they're doing
could break into your place
in less than a minute.
You really should consider
 upgrading to the new ones.
This whole rekeying...
It really only serves
for homeowners
to feel like
they're doing something.
How much are new locks?
What's the price
for your family safety,
Ms. Alexander?
Couple of hundred bucks.
If you're aiming for quality.
Well...
We'll look into that.
But we do have
the alarm system.
Oh, yeah.
I saw that.
It's a good one, too.
At least it was 12 years ago.
Hey, Mel,
have you seen
Monty anywhere?
Who's Monty?
Is that your boyfriend?
He's my cat.
What are you doing
 with my camera?
I saw this on the table
and I could not resist.
What's your name?
Hannah.
Don't you wanna know mine?
Not really.
Can you not...
Whoa! Oh, oh!
What are you doing?
Well, I'm thinking about
getting me one of these.
You know, when your mom
and I were younger,
these things were,
like, heavy.
Do you remember that?
No.
Well, I am a little older.
Do me a favor and tell
 Mr. Alexander
not to worry about
any sort of payment
just yet.
You all can owe me.
Welcome to
the neighborhood.
Oh, shit.
Look, I'm telling you,
 it could've been
 one of the movers.
But it not like
it's the first time
that I've showered
since I've been here.
I mean,
I would have seen it before.
Then it was your dad,
or Melanie.
I mean, who else could it be?
I don't know.
That's sort of the point.
Something's happening
in this house.
What?
Only two more months.
Only.
All right.
Oh!
Are your parents home?
No.
Oh, I see.
Uh, let me guess.
This isn't your brother.
That's disgusting.
I should go. See ya.
Bye.
Oh, here.
I'm Rosemary Fletcher.
I live a couple of
doors down.
Uh, Hannah. Hi.
So, are you gonna go
to Springville next year?
Yeah. I'll be a senior.
Oh, a new school
your senior year?
Same thing happened to me.
Your parents aren't in
the military, are they?
No. No. My dad was offered
a job at the airport.
That's why we moved.
He was out of work
for a while.
Well, don't worry
about the new school.
A week or two, and it'll
be just as unbearable
as the old one.
Well, I won't
keep you. Um...
Please give my best
to your parents.
Yeah, I will.
It was nice meeting you.
You, too.
Bye.
Excuse me?
Hi.
You here to help?
No.
Well, you might as well
get it over with.
I have a question.
It's not,
like, gross, is it?
No.
Okay.
Uh, well,
then go ahead and ask.
- My friends want...
- Hurry. Ask her.
They wanna know
what it's like living here.
What do you mean?
You know how
every neighborhood
has that one creepy house?
Yeah.
Well...
You're living in it.
So, is it true?
Did people really die here?
They were just trying
to get a rise out of you.
See how you'd react.
That's it.
React to what?
One of the kids
in the neighborhood
spooked Hannah.
Really? How?
They told me that the family
that lived here
was murdered in the house.
They said that?
Yeah.
And I told her that
information like that
had to be disclosed
to potential buyers,
and the realtor
never mentioned anything,
so there's...
Oh, my God...
Look, it happened
years ago, okay?
You're kidding, right?
This isn't funny, Dad.
I'm not trying
to be funny.
Unbelievable.
Look, not telling
you guys was wrong.
I admit that, okay?
But it's because
I didn't want you to get
those stupid thoughts
stuck in your heads.
This is a great house,
in a great neighborhood
that we actually
could afford.
And I just...
I wanted what was best
for both of you.
So, what happened?
 I don't know.
I don't know. Really, I don't.
Look, it happened
over 10 years ago.
Two families have
lived here since then.
You know, over in Europe,
they live in houses
that are hundreds
of years old, right?
I'm sure some pretty
bad stuff went down
in those too.
You don't see
people running around--
Well, what about the family
that lived here
right before us?
They said that
they just disappeared.
Hey, we were nearly
at that point
not so long ago, remember?
It happens.
 People lose their jobs
and walk away
from their mortgages
all the time.
Hannah?
Let her go, John. 
 Can you blame her?
She just found out her dad
is kind of an asshole.
Yeah, well, she's a teenager.
I'm pretty sure
she already thought that.
Detectives have just released
 the names of a family
killed in a murder-suicide
 earlier this week.
Police found
 the mutilated bodies
 of Elizabeth Howe
and her daughter, Rebecca,
 in their Springville home.
Elizabeth was found
 stabbed to death
 in her daughter's bedroom.
Downstairs, 17-year-old
 Rebecca had been butchered
just feet
 from the front door.
The suspect,
 husband and father,
 Robert Howe,
was found
 hanging in the attic.
Baffled neighbors
 claim they had never heard
 Robert and Elizabeth fight,
and that
 the family seemed normal.
Rebecca was a senior
 at Springville High School
and was aspiring to
 be a photographer.
Monty?
Monty?
Monty, come on.
Monty?
Monty, come here.
Monty?
Monty?
Dad!
Dad!
I'm coming!
 Dad!
Hold on!
I got you,
I got you--
There's someone
up there.
What are you talking about?
There is someone
up there.
John.
I'll go check it out.
Dad! No, please don't go!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Just calm down.
John!
John?
Dad.
Did you see anybody?
Dad?
There's nobody up there.
But I saw someone.
You saw what?
I don't know.
I could hear someone
breathing behind me.
Jesus.
Honey, don't you
think this is a little--
A little what?
I don't know.
Don't you think
it's a little convenient
that she's doing
all this right after
she finds out
what happened here?
That's why I didn't
wanna say anything.
Can I help you
inside with those?
Oh, thanks, Hannah.
That'd be great.
Your house is laid out
just like ours.
The wonders of
tract housing.
Did you know the family
that was killed in our house?
Such
a pretty girl, wasn't she?
How well did you
know them?
Oh. Not at all, really.
The dad seemed a bit strange,
but you would never think
that he was capable
of something so terrible.
The wife stayed at home.
 We'd wave, she'd wave.
They kept to themselves,
and so did we.
Which is why
it took her school
to discover what happened
after the girl was absent
for a number of days.
Taught us around here
 a hard lesson.
You never really know
who your neighbors are.
What about the family
that disappeared?
The ones that lived there
right before us.
They were, like, eight months
behind on their loan.
The Kelly woman
down the street heard
it was a year and a half.
So, you know.
Then I guess...
You never heard
if they
experienced anything...
Like it's haunted?
Every kid
 in the neighborhood
 thinks that.
I have never heard
anyone over 12
seriously talk about it,
including anyone
who lived there.
Oh.
Okay.
It's tough, moving.
Fucks with your head.
You know, 
 I think it's pretty cool.
Then you can live here.
Yeah. But over in Europe,
 the houses are old
and have plenty
 of creepy history
 but people still live in it.
No, don't.
Don't even say that.
All right.
Well, is now a bad time
 to ask if you got
 my message?
What message?
I left you a message
 on your camera.
You did?
It's not here.
 No, it's your camera?
Like that's a big surprise.
No, seriously.
Uh, I should go.
Hey, your camera will turn up.
 It always does.
Okay. Okay.
Everything all right?
Uh...
It's not great.
 Know what I think?
I think you need to
get out of this house.
Yeah. No kidding.
I mean, more, like,
for the afternoon.
I just want you to know
that you can talk
to me about things.
Yeah, but what's the point?
Neither of you believe me.
About what? The house?
Yes.
Stuff disappears or moves.
Doors close and open,
and those weird noises...
What weird noises?
Like creaking and...
Whistling.
So you've heard it too.
That doesn't mean
the house is haunted.
Hannah--
No, no, but something's
going on and it feels wrong.
You don't feel it?
I think there's an explanation
for everything.
Oh, you sound
just like Dad.
Hello?
False alarm?
Anything missing?
No.
But that doesn't mean
Ray wasn't in here.
Come on, Mel, you heard what
the security company said,
they probably just need
to adjust the sensitivity
of the alarm--
I don't trust him.
He basically said he could
break into our house
to my face.
Was that before or after
he tried to sell you
on the new locks?
Well, it worked.
I want new locks
and not from him.
Well, it's a little more
expensive than just rekeying,
you know.
We just got hit
with a ton of bills,
maybe in a couple of months--
No! Now.
What's the price
of your family's safety, John?
Jesus, Ray.
Is my work not good enough
for you, Mr. Alexander?
My wife and daughter
are just a little
bit uncomfortable.
Because of something I did?
I don't know, Ray.
What did you do?
Are you accusing me
of something?
'Cause that would
not be a good idea.
Is that a threat?
No.
That's a warning.
Take care, now.
Yeah, you too.
Asshole.
Huh. How'd that get...
Here we go. 
 You're upstairs.
I just wanna be
 the first to go on record
that I love you,
 Hannah Alexander.
Please don't show this
 to any of my friends. Okay?
 Thanks. Bye.
Who's Monty? 
 Is that your boyfriend?
He's my cat.
What are you doing
 with my camera?
Well, I saw this
 on the table
 and I could not resist.
This is where they eat.
This is where they sleep.
This is where she sleeps.
Ray!
So, the house is still listed
for sale by the bank.
Cops are on their way
to check it out now.
What does that mean?
It means that
they were squatters.
What did they say
about the video?
They're gonna go over it,
see if they can prove
it was him.
This guy was
in our house, John.
While we slept.
 I know.
You were right.
I'm sorry, honey.
Things were
actually happening,
and I just didn't listen.
I just wanted it to work.
 I want it to work.
Look, I'm just glad
that we stopped it
before it escalated
into anything worse.
Are you sure it's over?
 Absolutely.
We won't see Ray anymore.
Trust me.
We should go.
We will, darling.
I just gotta
do something first.
Hey. Sorry,
didn't mean to scare you.
That's okay.
You know, your mom
used to sleep-punch me.
What?
Sleep-punch?
Yeah.
Anytime I'd try
and wake her up,
or startled her somehow,
she'd start
flailing her arms around
and smack me
right in the face.
Funniest thing is,
she wouldn't even wake up.
She packed quite a punch.
Here.
I thought I still had
two months left.
Eh. Time off for
good behavior.
Hey. I love you, kiddo.
I love you, too.
Hey, Han.
 Last-minute change.
We're going to
 the club with my dad,
 and it's formal.
No jeans.
Great.
Yeah.
These'll do the job.
Fun.
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Don't make this--
What are you doing here?
Wait.
Where did you park?
Uh, down the street.
And don't worry,
I'll even sneak out the back.
Okay.
She looks happy,
at least.
- If she only knew, right?
- Yeah.
I felt bad throwing it away.
Hmm.
Look, she kinda looks
like you.
No, she doesn't.
Who is that?
Who?
Him.
Hannah, I'm home!
Oh, shit.
Mmm... What should I do?
He'd freak out if
he knew you were here.
Yeah, uh... It's cool.
I'll hide.
The closet.
No, no, Tommy.
Are you crazy?
No. Yeah, it's fine.
You can't hide in my closet.
Come on.
They won't see me, I swear.
I'm sorry, you have to go.
All right.
I'll come back tomorrow.
Mmm-hmm.
Hopefully my car
can take the drive.
I'll stall him
while you sneak out.
Hey, Dad, do you see
how clean the garage is?
Let's take a look.
Do you want 
 a sweater or something?
No.
 So, we're actually
 doing this, huh?
You guys look nice.
Thank you.
You'll be okay?
She'll be fine.
Plenty of leftovers
in the fridge.
And I plan on
faking food poisoning
around 9:00,
so we won't be home
too late.
Call if
you need anything.
I'll be fine.
You guys have fun.
Okay.
Bye.
No Tommy.
Bye.
You hit him with them shoes.
- Ain't I right, this time?
- You're silly.
You think I'm silly
 'cause I said about
 the stick?
All I was trying
 was to make you say,
"No, it wasn't no stick.
 It was my shoes."
- 'Cause I know what it was.
- You lie all the time.
All the time.
 How come I got
 those shoes then?
Where did you 
 get them?
I just walked right 
 into the apartment,
right into your room,
 and took 'em.
Just more lies, 
 'cause I burned those shoes.
I put them down
 the incinerator
 and burned them.
Nobody's got them.
You better 
 give me those shoes.
They're mine.
 Give them back to me.
You'd better give
 them back to me, Leroy!
I'm keeping them shoes!
Congratulations.
You're back to
 being grounded again.
Dad, no.
I can't stay here
any longer.
Hey, this is our
house now, Hannah.
Get used to it.
Dad, please!
If you would just listen to...
Huh.
David.
Leave it!
Wait! Wait! Wait.
Oh, it's in here somewhere.
Shit! Where is it,
where is it, where is it?
Got it.
"Forever together. 
 Lost love."
"The patient is well
 on his way to
 having a severe case
"of extreme agoraphobia.
"He tends towards
 violent reactions.
"The patient also suffers
 from occasional
 homicidal ideations."
David's
the boy in the window.
She had a brother.
So, you think
the Howes had a son,
but no one knew because...
Because he had
a fear of open spaces.
He never left the house.
They were gonna
 commit him, but he...
Okay... "He reacts violently
to new stimuli."
See?
He didn't want that.
He killed his family.
They wanted to take him away
from his home,
this house...
And that's what set him off.
Honey,
we're gonna call
this hospital and find out
what they know.
Okay? It's doubtful
 they'll tell us anything.
But if they do,
 we'll call the police.
All right?
We're gonna take
a look at this, sweetie.
Where's that
phone number?
I'm gonna call
the hospital.
Daddy!
He's here!
Dad!
Who's here?
Melanie! Melanie,
he's here!
Who? Who?
He's here!
He's downstairs!
Oh, my God! John!
Who?
David!
There's someone here!
Call the police! Go!
Dad! No!
Dad!
I'll call
the police.
You hit the panic button!
Police!
Sir? Are you all right?
Sir, can you hear me?
Yeah.
Just hang on.
Is there anybody in here?
Come out where I can see you.
 With your hands up!
Lock him down.
Detective Pascal
would like to
see you upstairs.
Yeah.
Ugh.
This T-Shirt,
does it look familiar?
Yeah.
Oh...
Well, looks like, uh,
this guy has been living
in your attic
for quite a long time.
You'd be surprised
how often it actually happens.
Don't worry.
It's over.
So, there's a motel
not too far from here
if you guys wanna--
Yes.
Absolutely.
Let's get him
prepped. Put a line in.
Yeah.
Hey,
 this is Tommy.
 Leave a message.
BP dropping.
Blood pressure's dropping.
We're losing him.
We'll be downstairs.
Hannah?
Han?
John?
John?
John, where's Hannah?
What do you mean?
She's not downstairs
with you?
She was in her room.
I thought
she came downstairs,
but she's not here.
Hannah!
Hannah?
Hannah?
Sweetie, where are you?
Hannah, can you hear me?
Come on, Hannah,
answer your phone.
She's not outside.
It's going
straight to voicemail.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
It's coming
from over there.
I hear it.
It sounds like it's
coming from over here.
- Hannah?
