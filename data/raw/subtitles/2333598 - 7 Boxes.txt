It's very hot today.
The sun is high, just as the exchange rate
of the dollar.
If you have dollars, prepare for changes.
If only the guarani was as high.
My god, the dollar surely sprang up incredibly today.
The news is everywhere. You can even open
the water tap and you'll hear it.
The success of 2005...
is here.
Please, don't kill me.
OK, I'll give you another chance.
OK, I'll give you another chance.
Answer this and I'll let you live.
Answer this and I'll let you live.
Do you know what Nemesis mean?
I don't know.
Of course you don't know.
Of course you don't know.
Shame...
Thanks.
Whose cart is it?
Nobody's, ma'am. But don't worry.
I'll take your stuff.
Go on.
Are you crazy?
This lady's in a hurry, partner.
Can't you see I put her goods on my cart?
- And you lost it, amigo.
- I did what?!
Pay attention to your work.
You watch TV - you don't eat.
Those are my goods. You're good for nothing.
What? You're good for nothing.
Enough. If you want to fight, I'll look for another cart.
That's not necessary, ma'am.
I'll take care of the goods.
where should I take them to?
There. And remember I'm in a hurry.
Yes, ma'am.
You're a disgrace.
A son of a bitch.
Asshole.
Blow me.
You blow me.
¿Want me to take your goods?
No. no.
Sir...
No, thank you.
Sir, should I...
No, thanks, mate.
Smile!
Hi.
Say hello, will you?
¿What's this?
I'm filming you. Say hello.
It's a mobile, isn't it?
Yup, I'm filming you.
Smile.
Let me see.
Wait.
Come on, let me see.
Play.
Like it?
Cool, isn't it?
Whose is it?
Leti's. He's selling it.
How much?
A lot. There's few of them.
But how much?
OK, gotta go!
100,000?
Are you crazy? Can't you see it has
the camera and stuff...
It's like being on TV.
True.
I want it.
You have no money.
I'll get it.
You'll get 600,000?
It's much, isn't it?
OK, I'm off or they're fire me.
See you.
600,000!
Victor, would you lend me 5,000?
It's because I haven't eaten today
and Luis stole my whole dough.
Come on. I'll give it back today.
I haven't got a single guarani.
You're such a niggard.
Don't ask me to get smokes for you.
Why aren't you paying attention to me?
I'm talking to you!
Victor?!
What's going on?
Where are you going, Victor?
What are you all doing
around here today?
Why do you want to know?
Tell me. I wanna know everything.
It's nothing.
It's just that the inspector
got an anonymous call today,
and ordered to make a raid.
What a barbarian.
What time do you leave today?
At 7:00. why?
Want be to drop by?
We're going for a drink.
A nice, cold beer.
It's really nice but I really
can't today.
I've got this veiling ceremony
of my late neighbour.
Bad time to die...
My gosh. You'll cry a lot.
You'll really cry very much.
Sure, I don't really want to go...
...but the deceased must be taken care of.
And when will you take care of me?
Me, who is alive and kicking for you?
When your wife lets you.
And on weekend? Come on.
Maybe...
Victor, what are you doing?
I'm only looking,
Who's this?
He does things for people here.
So...
I'll drop by on Friday to fool around with you
one more time, dolly.
I'll be waiting.
The fatty's boring as hell.
So, what's up, Victor?
Please show me the best phone you have
with a camera.
And what do you need it for?
No way I could sell it to anyone.
Seriously?
I really need the money...
They give 400 000,
but they say it's very worn out.
I've got to sell it to anyone, my friend.
And what about this moron?
Can't he just give you the money?
He drops you a used phone,
and it's you who's got to sell it.
He does what he can.
I can't stand him.
Glad I don't know him.
He does nothing and treats you
like a servant.
And honestly, you'll never get 600 000 for it.
For a mobile, here at the market.
What did he say?
I haven't got the slightest idea, my friend.
This one is the last.
It's got a photo camera, a film camera,
bluetooth, 512 of memory, everything.
And how much is it?
.1,100,000.
What?
What do you want a mobile like this for, Victor?
Wait a sec.
Bigcel...
Oh, Gus.
I already told you not to call my work.
But do you think I'm saying it just for the hell of it?
Anyone trusted?
But what will I know?
What for?
Wait a sec.
Victor, are you busy?
NPH insulin...
10ml bottle, 200,000.
The cheapest there is.
What? 200,000?
It's imported.
Come here.
How much do you have?
10,000, not more than that.
Shit.
Listen, miss, your boss knows me.
I don't have the money now.
But later I'll get some job and I'll pay you.
No, no credit here.
But your boss knows me.
Sure, but he's not here now.
It's not for me, it's for my son.
I need it urgently.
If you don't have the money,
there is no medicine.
Go, wait for me at home.
And the baby?
What will I do with him?
I'll get it, go home.
He's feverish.
Go.
He needs a lot.
Go!
I'll leave this as a deposit.
No, I already told you.
Off you go.
Gus here?
And who are you?
Ale sent me.
Get in.
This is the cart. Grab it.
Quick, load the boxes.
Come here.
Listen carefully, kid.
Those are seven crates which you
have to deliver to a place...
...I'll tell you later of.
Got it?
I'll give you a call to tell you
where you should take them.
Meanwhile this stuff has to be
as far as possible from here.
But I don't have a mobile.
What do you mean, jerk?!
Don Dario is on the phone.
He's very upset.
He wants us to present ourselves
before the inspector.
I'll dispatch the merchandise and I'm off,
I told you.
Didn't send it yet?!
Nelson didn't come!
- Hurry up with it, dammit!
- Dammit!
Come here, come.
Lend me your phone.
- What?
- Lend me your mobile.
- What for?
- Lend me.
- Last time I lent you.
- Just one more time.
- No, wait!...
- Get the hell out of here!
Listen to me, kid.
You have to guard those seven crates
as your own life.
You understood?
Take it. Come on, take it!
I'll call you now, it has got my name in it.
It says Gus.
When the crates return intact,
you'll get the dough.
OK, get out of here.
What's wrong?
Fuck.
- Come on, Gus, we're going.
- Got any cash?
- Not one guarani.
- Fucking hell.
Don Dario wants us to go.
Let's go.
Know what it is?
$100, almost 700,000
if you exchange today.
Take it.
Quick.
When the crates get back,
I'll give you the other half.
Deal?
Let's go.
Take it away.
Quick!
Go, quick!
Hello.
They left it for you at the reception.
Thank you, Jim.
Did you see how he looked at you?
It's not true.
You like him!
Tami,
may I ask you a favour?
What favour?
I have to leave an hour early.
Cover for me please.
What has Gus asked you for this time?
He wants me to go clean an apartment.
At 11 o'clock at night?
In your condition?
No, sorry, my dear, but your boyfriend
takes advantage of you.
Go in the morning and I'll help you.
No, I can't. It has to be today,
because in the morning the apartment
will not be used.
Oh, Leti, I don't want any more problems.
Please?
Are you crazy?
You call me and you don't open the door.
- Too late, mate.
- Too late what?
I sent the merchandise with someone else.
Get out of here.
I was looking for a medicine
for my son.
I don't give a fuck.
Somebody else has your job.
Get out of here.
We've got everything in order here, inspector.
Peace and quiet.
How about the revision, guys?
Everything in order?
Everything, sir.
False alarm?
False alarm, sir.
Thanks for the visit, inspector. Anytime.
My pleasure, see you. Let's go.
Excuse me, don Dario.
And what do you think you're doing here?
And where's the merchandise?
Gus!
Gus!
Gus, you fucker!
Where are my crates?
Who took my crates?
Nelson was late.
A little, but I'm here.
I was buying a medicine for my son.
I don't give a fuck about your son.
I'll shove this knife
down your ass, fucker.
- Who do you think you are?
- Do it then.
Do it.
Shut the fuck up!
I asked you - who's got my crates?
Victor.
And who the fuck is Victor?
It's someone trusted from my sister.
This kid will lose all of your crates, don Dario.
Have you gone mad?
Got bumped in the head?
How could you pass such delicate
merchandise to a stranger?
Make him bring back my crates...
...or get ready to face the consequences, got it?
What are you looking at?
Get to work!
Look what I've got.
And I won't give you a bit, niggard.
'scuse me.
What a yummy sandwich!
What a yummy sandwich,
which I won't share with you.
It's yours?
You got a mobile?
Stole it, right?
Hello?
Where are you?
I asked where are you.
Yes?
I want you to give me the merchandise right away.
And who are you?
You're Nelson, right?
Who's this?
Who gave you my number?
Don Dario, Gus' boss, who else?
He want you to give me the merchandise at once.
If so, let him call me...
...and let him tell me
to give you the merchandise, you idiot.
Who's this?
Fuck!
I'll find you, whatever it takes.
Who wants to steal your merchandise?
I'm talking to you!
Nelson, damn it.
Nelson who?
Liz, listen to me, please.
If you see Nelson or the police,
let me know right away, you understand?
Why?
- Go away, that's why.
- No! I don't wanna go.
- Go!
- No!
- I told you to go!
Fine!...
Why so nervous again? Sicko.
Let's go to the doctor.
What's wrong?
No, nothing.
You're going to have your baby.
Go distract don Chan or he'll be moaning again.
Go!
Me?
Let's go to the doctor.
It was just a small sting.
Pick this up before he comes here.
Let's go to the doctor, Leti.
Just a sting, I'm alright.
What's up?
Nelson is the one with curly hair?
Blue eyes? Loli's brother?
There he goes.
There he is!
Fuck!
What's wrong?
Why, Victor?
Tell me.
Victor! What's going on?
What's wrong with him?
It's yours, huh?
Puul it out, quick!
Gimme!
Yeah, man.
Yeah, I've got your stuff.
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
Easy, man.
Bye!
You owe me one.
We gotta move fast...
...before the merchandise gets lost.
Yeah, I'm waiting. We have to solve it right away.
It is.
The thing is that it's tough here,
my friend. We had a visit.
It's settled though, don't worry.
Don't yell at me! I know I messed this up!
Fuck!
What?
Shit!
Victor, tell me already.
What's in the crates?
I dunno. It's better we don't know.
What are you up to, you looney?
Watch those for me, will you?
What, alone?
Guard them with your life, get it?
As much?
Just one sec.
Here, you can play if you like.
This phone sucks.
It has nothing.
Hi.
Is Tamara here?
Her brother.
Who are you?
Wait a sec.
Allright.
Victor, what are you doing here?
Have you still got this mobile?
I do.
Do you know already who's going to buy it?
Yes, I want it.
You?
And may I ask where you're going to
got the money from?
I got some merchandise to carry.
And they're going to pay good for it.
Victor, don't get into trouble now...
See this?
It's money, dollars, get it?
I'll keep this one.
And give this one to Leti
as a part of the deal.
And let her keep the phone for me.
Shit.
Victor!
Fuck. Shit.
And then we're going to get the three pieces together.
If we exchange it today,
it'll be around 600.000.
Tell Leti to keep the phone for me.
Allright.
Good! I'm off.
Holy fuck.
Liz!
Liz!
Liz!
Liz!
Liz!
Wait, I say!
Where are you going?
Wait for me here.
Sicko!
Shit.
It's my friend's.
And where's your friend?
You're my friend.
Tell me, it's not that hard.
Just tell the truth, kiddo.
What's going on?
They want to know what's inside.
Is it yours?
Yes, I left it for her to watch.
A routine activity.
What have you got there?
Just clothes, nothing more.
A bit heavy for clothes, eh?
Proceed.
What do you want me to open it with?
With my finger?
Dweeb. Here.
Useless.
Holdit-holdit-holdit...
Back, back, back.
Step back!
100 meters. Not closer than 100 meters!
Back, back, back.
The merchandise belongs to Alejandra.
Alejandra who?
The one who sells mobiles.
Alejandra?
I thought you looked familiar.
She'll be mad at me
if I let this be opened.
Leave it, mate.
I trust the kid.
Does she have a boyfriend?
Don't think so.
Tell her to start
paying attention to me.
Hey mate, they found something
suspicious in zone 4. Let's go.
I'll tell her.
Don't forget.
How come they're so unorganized?
It's not Ale's, is it?
What's inside, Victor?
I'm talking to you, am I not?
Leave me alone, I've got to se something.
i'm going with you.
- Alone.
- Let's go!
- I'm going alone.
- Let's go!
- Stay.
- We're going both!
- Don't you understand me?
- Let's go!
- I'm going alone!
- Let's go!
Alone! Get it?! Fuck! Shit!
Dick!
Ask me for a favor, you ingrate!
Easy. We're gonna find a taxi.
Her baby wants out,
we're going to the hospital!
We've got to go! The baby's coming out!
I dunno what you're saying, twerp.
But my love, listen...
No, wait...
Gustavo took my mobile...
...that's why I couldn't answer the message.
And what are you doing here?
The police have got your crates, don Dario.
What?
The kid lost it all.
I met him and he was with the police...
...who were revising the merchandise, don Dario.
Are you sure those were our crates?
Why should I lie?
Fucking hell!
What have you screwed up this time?
The police found our crates.
What crates?
I still don't understand.
What's here to understand?
Today morning you gave me the password.
Tomato and lettuce.
And you told me to split the tomato
into seven pieces and make the shipment.
And that's what I did.
I split it in seven pieces
and then the police came...
...so I sent the merchandise
for a little walk around here...
...until the visit is over.
Wait a minute.
You sent $250,000 for a walk?!
Wait outside.
We agreed the lettuce to be the money,
and you said clearly - tomato.
Sure, I said tomato,
But the tomato has always been the money,
not the lettuce.
Huh?
When I said tomato, I meant
to prepare the $250,000...
...in seven parts to be shipped.
The tomato always was the money!
And if you got it wrong...
What shit have you sent away?
You're a dickhead.
What kind of brain thinks of
cutting a body into seven parts?
But I asked you three times...
I'm gonna split the tomato in seven,
and so you told me.
But tomato is money,
and lettuce is the lady.
And what made me trust...
...a mental retard like you.
Easy, it was only a little
misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding?
Don't you realize what you've done?
What made me do this business with you?!
What was I expecting from an
illiterate moron like you?
And this bloodbath of yours
if what the police found?
That's what the cart-pusher said.
Know what?
The plan went down the drain.
Can you imagine what kind of
hell will break loose...
...when Jorge realizes
his wife is stiff?
You already screwed this up
after the lady died...
...and now she's going to pay her husband
a visit in seven pieces.
You expect the police not to realize...
...that the corpse went out of here?
If they won't guess it by
the cart-pusher who carried it.
Call your cart-pusher, you idiot!
Call him.
Nelson! Nelson!
He's already gone.
- Where?
- I don't know.
You mean $250?
No, $250 000.
$250,000? Are you sure?
Yes, $250,000!
That's a lot of cash, mate.
Allright, let's see.
The dollar stands for 6,520...
Multiplied by 250,000...
Fuck me.
Over 1,600 millions.
A lot of money.
Well, I'm off.
What happens if the cart-pusher tells the police...
...where he got the body?
Try to understand, don Dario,
I did what I could.
And you messed it up, as always, right?
Thanks to you I'll rot in the Tacumbu prison.
Call the Victor guy now.
Here, Jim, stop.
Let's go, my love. Get ready.
Let's go.
Go call a doctor.
Doctor! Doctor, please!
I don't know what you're going to do...
...but I'm going to pick up my $ 200,000
and disappear for a long time.
Holdit-holdit-holdit...
How come 200 for you and 50 for me?
The deal was always that you stick with 50.
And now, leaving Jorge aside,
you're going to keep your part?
And who was the old duck handed to?
In whose premises did the poor thing die?
Who gave the body
on a tray to the police?
Be grateful for 50, fucker.
No sir, no chance.
The risk is shared, so 50/50.
Where's the money?
Here, see?
How can you keep the money
in a place like this?
And where should I?
In my butt?
Don Dario? Don Dario!
What do you want?
It's Victor.
He says he's got the merchandise with him.
But Nelson said that
the police took it.
Cannot trust him either.
what are we going to do?
Well, let im bring it here.
No, not here.
There's a police booth at the corner.
Allright, point him some spot
around here for the delivery...
...and we'll find him.
Go, asshole!
Victor! Victor!
Allright, I'll meet you there.
Your dad got angry, didn't he?
It doesn't matter.
Are you a relative of Leti Sanchez?
No, I'm her friend, doctor.
Look, it's a delicate situation,
she's about to go to the delivery room,
and her pregnancy is fragile.
We need to contact someone from her family,
or someone with the same blood type.
It's just I don't know where they live.
I only know she's got a boyfriend,
who is the father,
but I have no idea
where to find him now.
Try anyway.
She left you this.
Thanks, doctor.
1173 MANDUVIRA STREET
Would you give me a lift?
I don't know what I'll do.
Good evening. Woh are you, Zoilan?
Less mayonnaise, right?
Two sausages with chimichurri, please.
Coming up.
And if she agrees?
I dunno, I guess I'll
take her to the cinema.
What a beauty!
Help yourself.
Thank you, we don't drink on duty.
A bit won't do you any harm.
A bit will not.
If you found lots of money,
would you earn anything from it?
What do you mean?
They say they found 1.600 millions
packed into crates.
Where? I wish they would.
When?
My buddy just told me,
that they found lots of money
inside some crates...
...carried by a boy and a girl.
Those ones of your friend, Alejandrita?
Negative, we didn't even open those ones.
Really?
Who would stuff 1.000 millions
into some old crates?
Don't be silly, mate.
I thought the same thing.
Put it on my bill, Zoilan.
Allright, let's go.
No problem.
Bye.
Thanks, mate.
See you.
Here, here.
Come on, this way, quick.
This way.
Please don't come closer, ma'am.
No entry, kid.
What happened?
A container exploded.
Please, I need to move away my stuff.
Sorry, but it all burnt down.
Just for a second, please.
I'm telling you everything burnt.
Can't you see everything's melted?
My boss will kill me.
Shame. Move away 20 meters, as I tell you.
It's still dangerous here.
Come on.
Come this way.
This way, miss, quick.
Come on, quick.
Move, there's more people.
All of you owe me one.
Today is my payday.
We must find Victor, whatever it takes.
This bloke wants to
steal my merchandise.
I won't let him.
My son is very sick
and I need the money.
All of us know the market perfectly.
This kid can't hide from us.
The man who finds this enemy of mine,
will receive 100,000 instantly.
100,000?
What kind of merchandise is it?
It's no smuggled oil, pal.
It's not your problem, mate.
What do you mean it's not my problem?
Drugs.
Coke packs?
Guys, do what I tell you,
get me this merchandise,
and I'll give 150,000
every one of you at once.
I would go to a reserve
and make a small party.
I'm going with you.
And the girls, them too?
Why shouldn't I go too?
You're staying.
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to do?
What did you say?
Get outta here.
Shut up.
300,000 each and it's a deal.
Deal, 300,000.
Deal.
And should we get rid of the kid?
I only want the merchandise.
I don't care what you'll do with him.
Bring me the merchandise, do you understand?
We'll be around, I'll call you.
Don't come back empty handed, understand?
Easy, leave it to me. Let's go.
Delegating things, for fuck sake.
Tell me about it!
Go!
I guess it's here.
Seems so.
Well, thanks, Jim.
What do you expect to find here?
Anyone who could tell me anything
about Let's boyfriend, Gus.
Fine, go now or your dad gets
even more angry at me.
What was that?
Nothing...
...only that I better wait here...
...because this place looks quite dangerous.
No, really, go, Jim.
It'll make me calmer.
Go.
Fine.
Who are you?
Asshole!
Pain in the ass, what do you want now?
It's you who's pain in the ass.
Nobody will answer.
Why's that?
Rarely anyone comes here.
And if they find out, what will we do?
Shut up, you jinx.
I risk my skin because of you.
Because of me?
Or because we're both
greedy for the money?
How did the lady die?
Hello!
...and seemingly everything
was under control,
but the fool found an iron rod,
and thought she would
force the window open.
Anybody here?
And they found her?
No, they heard nothing.
They were playing cards and drinking.
They had no idea.
I guess she broke the glass with the rod,
and she put her hand through, like this...
...and she cut herself with a piece of glass.
Quite some blood, mate.
Later they went up to bring her food...
...and found her lifeless,
too late it was.
Halt, stop right there.
Negligence, period.
What do you think I was supposed to do, huh?
"Accident at work", said the whore
while getting pregnant.
Are you eating this?
You're not gonna leave me alone, are you?
Why are you giving me the hard time?
You're acting ridiculous.
You play the tough one.
You're a pain in the ass, Liz.
And you? Lazy-bones.
Lady virgin of Caacupe,
please help me.
Who are they, Victor?
Tell me, who are they?
Shit.
It's been an hour.
Delivered, boss.
All seven?
You think I'm stupid?
The've just split up a little.
Those are not the crates!
This way, the police are coming.
Freeze! Stop right there!
Halt!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Turn around! Now!
They shot him cold-blooded.
Did you see anything?
Nelson and his fellows.
They won't spare us.
What are we gonna do?
I dunno.
Let's go now.
Let's go.
Miss, I'd like to report a 1050.
Where are you, officer?
I'm currently in market, I need a car.
Impossible, no cars available.
What do you mean, no cars?
I've got a corpse and a suspect here.
What am I supposed to do?
I told you, no cars.
And what do you want me to do?
To drag them on a cart?
And?
Shit!
They took all my merchandise.
What do you care if those were fake?
And how do you know?
Because I know where the real ones are.
The real ones are burnt.
No, they're not.
Huh?
Why didn't you tell me before?
What were you waiting for?
And why didn't you tell me
you were running around with a corpse?
How should I know?
Liar!
What did you get yourself into, Victor?
And now I should confess all my problems...
...to an annoying girlie-pants like you?
Annoying girlie-pants?
Know what?
This girlie-pants has your crates,
and you go fuck yourself.
See you.
Hi.
Where are they, motherfucker?
Liz!
Liz! Wait, you asshole!
The fucker hung up on me!
And Gus's phone is offline.
Something's wrong.
Fuck, aren't you a moaner.
He'll call, my friend.
Why don't we go and look for him?
No, for fuck sake!
We've got to call Jorge
and speed up the split.
Huh?
What I said! We gotta call Jorge
and split the dough.
$100.000 in his hands...
...will help him understand
the small problems we had.
- You think...?
- I do, you jerk!
Positive, inspector sir.
We've got proof that the victim was here.
We caught two suspects.
Bring them to the base.
Copy that, QAP.
Good evening.
What were you doing there?
I was looking for the boyfriend of a friend
of mine, who's about to give birth.
What's his name?
Gus, but I know nothing more.
And you, what's your name?
He doesn't speak Spanish.
What do you do?
I'm the chef's assistant.
You must make good money,
if you can afford such phone.
It's my friend's.
She gave it to me to sell it...
...because she needs the money
for the birth.
How much does she want for it?
800.000.
800.000?
Why so much?
Because of the camera.
That's true, Osorio.
This type is spectacular.
The picture is great, I once made
a film with one of those.
I'd suggest you to get rid of it
before you get to the station,
because they're going to confiscate it.
Up.
This is the dumbass?
That's him.
Lookee here.
What are you doing here?
You know each other?
Never seen him in my life.
Oh, don't know me anymore?
Herrera y Caballero, my love,
I cost you 30,000.
What the fuck are you tossing
this corpse here for?
Watch it, watch it.
Oh, mom!
Is he really dead?
Move a bit, for fuck's sake.
Let's go, it's late already.
Liz!
Wait a minute.
No. You've been really bad for me, Victor.
Now that you need me, you're being sweet.
I don't want to know anything.
Wait. Liz.
Wait.
I was nervous.
Try to understand.
Don't be mad at me.
No. I'm not going to forgive you.
I'm really mad at you, Victor.
And what the hell did you tell me
you had the cart?
So that you would stop thinking I'm stupid.
And to give you a hard time, asshole.
Know what?
You're worthless.
Take one of the crates
and shove it up your ass, ok?
Liz.
Liz!
What's gong on?
What are you doing?
Shut up.
I said shut up.
There goes Nelson and his fellows,
those who killed the bloke.
Faster, idiot! Faster!
Nelson, where are we going?
Move it, that's where.
And what did you come here for?
Move, for fuck's sake!
Where's the merchandise?
I'll never tell you.
What are you laughing at?
At your baby face.
Forgive me, please.
Let's do something.
We'll race to the Lady Virgin.
If you win...
...I'll give you your crates back.
And if I win...
...you give me your phone.
OK?
You're crazy.
Let's see who's worth more.
Now!
Shit, Liz.
Liz!
I saw you, my dear.
Is it your boyfrenid?
No? Not yet, but this is how it starts.
We agreed on 400,000, right?
So show me how it works.
It's easy.
Osorio?
Huh?
Why is he here again?
Who?
The Gus guy.
It's complicated.
We suspect he knows something
but won't talk.
Really?
I'll help you then.
How?
Put us both into a cell,
and you'll have all the information you want.
How are you going to do that?
My love!
I know how to do it.
And what do you want for it?
Information costs, amigo.
This is inspector Schémbori,
inspector sir.
This Gus bloke started talking.
I'll send the car number 5.
Yes, some crates.
It seems that the cart-pusher...
I know the cart-pusher.
Please return to your seat, miss.
Yes, a thin boy...
Dark, medium height.
Yes, between 18 and 19 years.
He's my brother and he's got the other half.
You took a shortcut, right?
Who comes first, wins.
That was the deal.
It doesn't count.
You know perfectly well
I want to recover my stuff.
I apologized already.
You know what?
We women are worth much.
Don't you ever forget it.
Understand?
A hand? I want the phone.
Show me my stuff first.
Give me the phone.
My stuff.
Who won? I did.
Give me the phone.
Fuck, you're a pain.
Here they are.
Happy?
Lend me the phone one more time.
Only for a second.
Please.
500... 600... 700...
800... 900...
1000.
$249,000, $1,000 is missing.
The old man didn't bring it all...
or somebody messed around
in your slaughterhouse.
What are you insinuating?
Insinuating?
I'm telling you straight.
One of your colleagues
must have messed around with it.
But nobody knew anything.
No? Really? No one?
Well, Gus knew.
But he wouldn't touch it.
Wouldn't he?
You better watch your phone,
it might be Jorge.
Esteban, about time, dammit.
Hello?
Hello? Don Dario?
Yeah, who are you?
I'm Victor.
Huh? Hello?
Hello?
He hung up.
Shit.
Fucking hell!
What happened, Victor?
I don't know what's wrong with this phone.
Shit.
The battery's dead, grandpa.
And I was about to talk to Don Dario.
Shit.
What are you doing?
I'm praying.
I'm asking her spirit
not to be angry at us.
We'll carrying her, aren't we.
We'll get a battery.
Wait.
Let's go.
Wait.
Come on!
And when did you last see him?
Around some 6:00.
He was with his friend, Liz.
And do you know what your brother is carrying?
Look, my child,
you're going to go with them.
Don't be scared.
The'll take a ride...
...and if you see your brother,
warn him.
It's for the good of you both,
do you understand?
My dear, what happened?
A client.
Did you try to steal again?
You broke your head.
But I smacked the bloke.
You, go inside, and you, Korean,
you can go now.
No! I won't leave her alone.
Wasn't it that you didn't speak Spanish?
Fine, get in you both. Come on.
How will we get the battery for my phone?
"My phone"?
My phone!
You don't respect me, Victor!
You act like a dickhead again.
We made a deal...
...and we agreed the phone
will be my prize.
What's wrong again?
Are you listening to me, Victor?
Do you pay any attention to me?
Wait here.
Fuck.
Where is my crate, you prick?
Victor?
Tano?
What's up, man?
what were you up to?
Haven't seen you for ages.
You stole a crate from me.
What crate?
The one you took from Liz.
Who's Liz?
It's her.
This girl is Liz?
How the hell was I supposed to know
it was your crate?
What did you do with it?
It's quite a merchandise you carry.
And where is it?
I tossed it into the river.
The river?!
How do you take a photo?
You must push the button, here on the top.
Here?
Yes.
Here it is.
Hey, look at me, mate.
Dumbass.
Isn't it nice.
Wild.
And to start filming?
I'll show you but I'd like
to ask you a favour.
What favour?
Information costs.
Nelson and his pack are coming!
Nelson?
There! And there!
Fuck!
What should we do now?
Victor, they'll kill us.
What's going on?
You gotta help us, Tano.
You must get us out of here.
There. Follow me.
Where?
Just follow me.
And how are we supposed to get in?
It's the only way, let's go!
Go!
Come on.
The fucker went in there,
don't let him escape.
Come on, hurry.
Get in there.
Let us through!
Out, out.
Get out of here.
Come here.
Get in, get in!
Out of the way.
Let me through.
Come on.
How are we gonna get through?
Come on!
Go, don't think, Victor!
'Scuse me, 'scuse me.
Out of the way.
'Scuse me.
Fuck, sorry.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Clear the way!
Out of the way!
Fuck.
Hey!
What's wrong with you, imbecil?
Victor!
Go!
Motherfucker.
What have you done?!
Fucking morons!
Doctor, where's the delivery ward?
Next corridor, on the left.
It's here. Wait.
Hurry.
Hey mommy...
Leti...
She's sleeping.
Let's go then.
Wait please.
Come on.
A second, you said.
Wait.
Get well fast, gotta work.
Come on now!
You've got to leave her alone.
I had to give her the money.
And you did it.
Jorge...
how good you called, man.
Yeah, we need to finish
the tomato splitting.
What?
Hello!
Jorge, it's Luis.
Something urgent came up
and we gotta go now.
Your place, in 15 minutes.
Impossible, Jorge.
It's got to be in 15 minutes...
No, nothing, everything's fine,
you needn't worry.
See you in 15 minutes, right?
OK, bye.
Liz!
Liz!
The fucker tried to fool me, huh?
You don't fuck with me.
You screwed up.
But don't worry, I'll settle this up.
And since I'm kind...
...I'll give you a chance.
Hand over the crates,
and if not, I'll feed you some lead, got it?
You don't fuck with me
or with my mates.
You know that well.
Are you crazy?
There he goes!
He got away.
He went here.
Come on, this way.
Where do you think you're going?
Anything you don't understand?
No entry.
Get out!
No entry at this hour.
How much do you want?
Come on, tell me!
What are you gonna do, jerk?
Come on, let's go.
The kid is there and he must not get away.
I'll give you 500,000 for every crate!
Move it!
Let's go!
He went to the top level.
Miserable shit.
Move it, the shithead is there.
Split up and stop him.
Get on.
Fucking grab him.
Come on, get on.
Fuck!
Climb there!
Get him.
Who are these?
Climb there.
Come on, fucker.
Get him!
Come on, shoot!
One more time!
What's wrong?
I thought I heard a gunshot.
I heard nothing.
Get him!
Get him!
Fucking hell, we said 15 minutes
and it's been already 20.
Call him.
Who?
Oh, right.
Good evening, easy, it's a robbery.
Come on, give me your keyes.
My friend's knife is quite sharp.
Give me your phone.
Give them yours, we'll need this one
to call Jorge.
Huh? He's got one too?
Give it to my friend then. Come on!
Allright, allright.
Gimme, dammit!
You've got to be grateful
I don't have a driver's license...
...because if I did, I'd take your van too.
Thanks, man!
They robbed us!
Did they?
Yes!
What happened?
They were shooting at me,
some blokes on the parking lot.
Let them know on the radio.
Look, officer. They shot at me!
Take it easy, mate.
Some 7 or 8 guys, they got
behind me and kept shooting.
I wasn't carrying anything.
How many of them?
7, 8, more less.
Have you identified them?
No, could not see anyting.
Where the fuck have you been?
There's police there.
We were looking for you.
What's the shooting all about?
I'll tell you later.
Tano...
You have to get me a cart.
How am I supposed to find a cart at this hour?
If you get me one,
we'll be even with the crate you stole from me.
Allright, be right back.
I thought they killed you.
Quick.
What are we going to do?
Get the crates.
I told you I heard a gunshot.
Who would want to rob
an ugly van like this?
There's my brother.
Where?
What's going on?
Get up.
How can you sit on the lady?
She's dead already.
Your order.
We're even, right?
Thanks, amigo.
And now, how can we get
a battery for my phone?
You've got a mobile, right?
Yeah, why?
Hello?
Hello? Don Dario?
This number doesn't belong
to mister Dario anymore.
What do you mean it doesn't?
It has just been stolen from him.
And who are you?
I'm the one who did the stealing.
Oh, right.
I need to talk to him,
it's a matter of life and death.
He's on the Dr. Francia avenue.
In a van, green and white,
next to the hot dog bar.
Thanks, appreciate it, man. Bye.
We've got to get out of here.
Where to?
This is where I'm leaving, amigo.
I've got to get back
to my ladies in one piece.
Allright, thanks, man.
Thanks what?
And my battery? Don't play a smartass.
Oh, right.
Thanks.
And my phone too.
Fucking hell... Let's go.
Let's go.
Attention, base. Attention, base.
He's got the merchandise.
He's with a girl, around 15 years old.
Her name's Liz, she's his friend.
But I don't know who's the guy.
...and a youngster, black cap,
long hair, slim...
...between some 18 and 20 years old.
QSL, Proceed.
Copy that, QAP.
I think I know your brother.
Why don't we arrest them?
No.
They want us to follow them
until they hand over the crates.
Go, go.
Come on.
How's my lady doing?
As fresh as a lettuce.
Put down your cigarette.
Why didn't you let her go yet?
Daddy already started suspecting me.
We're just doing that.
The thing is there's
a lot of police on the street.
We're putting priority
on the lady's security.
...they should be letting her out
in the agreed spot.
This very moment...
What's this meeting about?
Well, we thought it might be interesting...
...to be sure that each one
receives his part of the dough.
Interesting for whom?
We were supposed to split the dough tomorrow.
Tomorrow early I have to use the money.
And that's why we should put ourselves at risk?
You're crazy.
Something weird is happening here.
What's happening?
Huh?
Tell me, for fuck's sake!
They set up here.
You're doing it again.
Wait here.
It's dangerous.
No! I want to go with you.
No, you don't get it.
Yes.
Yesyesyes, I told you.
- Yes.
- No.
Friends, you said?
I don't want anything to happen to you.
Wait for me here.
What are you doing?
I wanna film and make photos
with my new mobile.
Press it says video.
Where? Here?
Here, here.
You Koreans are good with technology.
That's not what we agreed.
Are you taking me for some kind of fool?
Why?
You waiting for anyone?
Who would I be waiting for this late?
Who is it?
Victor! I brought the merchandise.
Victor?
How did he found us?
Who's Victor?
What merchandise is he talking about?
It's no one.
It's some jerk that works with Dario.
Go and see what he wants.
Yes, of course.
You're staying here.
What the fuck do you want? Piss off.
I brought the merchandise.
It's not a good moment, amigo.
Go away, understand?
You screwed me once already.
It was not me who screwed up.
It was Nelson who ruined everything.
Go away. Take this and go.
Don't you understand?
I want my second half.
What half?
What is this?
Your employee told me,
that if I deliver the merchandise...
...he would give me
the other half of it, understand?
Oh, this Gus guy fucked you big time, amigo.
A dollar is no good, once torn.
Get it?
Here.
Now take the merchandise
far away from here.
Later I'll call you to bring it.
No! This was not the deal.
Positive, inspector sir, it's some business
on the Rodriguez de Francia street.
Next to the "El Gordo" hot dog bar.
I can't see the number from here.
QSLQAP
Don't you know whose business this is?
No, no idea.
It's some Arab's...
some Nasul.
Nasul.
Nasul.
My friend, this is what we'll do.
If you take the merchandise away now,
drop by with the crates to my place tomorrow,
and I'll give you 100,000 thousand.
Is that OK?
Fucking prick, wait here,
I'll bring you your fucking $100 already.
Yes, inspector sir, understood.
We're waiting. QSLQAP.
Confirmed, the business belongs
to the husband of the missing lady.
Let's go in! What are we waiting for?
No! They're sending another car.
the inspector wants us to wait here.
Fuck's sake.
Easy, mate.
I won't let anyone take
a single bill out of it,
until I count every single
dollar of it personally, understood?
But it's only $100.
No, you fuck!
You're a fucking wimp.
I'll take out a $100 from
my own share and that's it!
Write it down in your
fucking notebook, you dick!
Fuck's sake, Jorge,
why do you make such a problem?
$100 more, $100 less.
I don't care.
Who's this guy outside?
And why should I give anything to him?
- How would I know?!
- Careful, dammit.
It's our money as well.
Sure, motherfucker.
Let it go.
It's our money as well.
It's mine too.
where are you going?
Wait.
Stop or I'll kill you.
You understand?
Hold it!
What are you doing here?
He just fucking shot him.
They're armed, we have to proceed.
In the car!
What was that?
A gunshot, I guess.
Where are you going to hide?
You still think you're better, huh?
We'll settle the score now.
It's paytime, you little shit.
Where are you going?
Now you'll find out who I am.
Run, Victor!
Stay, Liz. Stay there.
Where are you going?
What will you do now, jerk?
Police!
Let's get outta here, go!
Hold it!
C'mon! I'm not scared!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Come on, imbeciles.
Step back!
Get the fuck out of here!
Drop your gun!
You're sorrounded.
Stay there, you bastards
or I'll shoot this little shit.
Holdit-holdit-holdit...
Where do you think you're going
with this money?
You're not planning to
fool anyone, are you?
This is life, papa.
Those who live, live out the stupid.
Want it?
Get back or I'll fucking shoot this motherfucker.
Take it easy.
What is it that you want?
Victor!
There's my fucking money, understand?
Get back, don't you understand?
Release him and take your crates.
This is my money
and I'm taking it with me.
Another news, perhaps the most
remarkable of today's edition.
It's about a horrific discovery
of a body of a woman...
...dismembered and packed
into seven crates,
found by the police at dawn.
After a violent confrontation
that cost four people their lives.
The quartered corpse belongs
to Jamili Adda de Nasul,
who had been forcefully abducted...
in a kidnap conducted by her own husband,
and for whom the ransom had been paid a day before...
that had amounted to a large sum of money.
The ransom money belonged
to the victim's father,
a Syrian-Lebanese shopkeeper Jaliv Adda.
For the first time in the
Paraguayan television,
you can yourself be a spectator
of the real confrontation...
...between the police and the criminales...
...at the very heart of the market 4.
Those exclusive images
were captured by a witness...
...and therefore we present them to you.
