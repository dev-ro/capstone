We all start off in life
with a dream, don't we?
For a tennis player,
it's being in the final
of the Grand Slam...
center court, a high lob,
a smash.
Game, set and match...
you're a champion.
But for most tennis players,
that's all it ever is... a dream.
The reality is another story...
my story.
You see that good-looking fella?
No, not the kid in white.
The other, tired, good-looking fella.
Yeah. Him.
Well, that's me.
British Davis Cup a long time ago.
Two singles titles even longer ago.
Presently ranked 119th in the world.
Sport is cruel.
Now, I know it doesn't
sound too bad.
Four million tennis players in the world,
and I'm 119th.
But what that really means is this...
118 guys out there are faster,
stronger, better and younger.
And it gets you thinking.
You'll be 32 in...
The prime of my life.
How long can Peter Colt
keep playing this game?
Time to retire gracefully.
Stop it. Stop it. Just serve.
These young guys... where do they
get the energy, the focus?
No fear. You see,
the one thing you can't have is fear.
And for the first time in my life,
I'm afraid.
Not oflosing.
I'm not even afraid of the kid.
I'm afraid of what happens
if that ball keeps going by me.
What happens then?
I hope you don't mind, but I took
the liberty of having it engraved.
- Wow.
- Exactly.
Frankly, my biggest problem
is parking.
Right.
Mm, not for you, of course.
No. Your own space.
Nameplate again.
Oh, good.
Hello, lan. Is this the young man
you were telling us about?
Mm-hmm. Peter Colt,
the one and only.
Once ranked
15th in the world, I hear.
Uh, 11 th, actually,
for the better part of'96.
Yes. Peter's got himself
a wild card at Wimbledon.
- Then we're hoping he'll be
hanging his racket here at the club.
- Well, we'll see.
We shall look forward to giving you
a peek at our ground strokes.
Won't we, ladies?
- Oh, do shut up, Sylvia. Good luck
at the championships, young man.
- Thank you very much.
Yes. Carry on.
Uh, Peter. Peter.
Watch the ladies.
Occupational hazard.
Of course.
Oh, look at this.
Look at this.
Completely new hybrid.
Yes, developed by the Yanks.
Firm but springy.
Look, Peter.
I can't wait forever.
There's no one else I'd rather...
lan.
Look no further.
You have your tennis director.
Oh, that is splendid.
So splendid.
Oh, look. That's Peter Colt,
the new pro.
Once ranked 17 th
in the world.
Eleventh!
I was ranked 11 th in the world.
What makes one tennis player
different from another?
It isn't a killer forehand or serve.
Lots of people have those.
But the great ones
have something else.
Some say it's a supportive family.
Others say it's being hungry,
really hungry.
But as you can see,
I've never been hungry.
Hello.
And as far as
a supportive family goes...
Mum? Dad?
Anybody home?
Hello, Carl.
Life still giving
you trouble, is it?
"Deep Throat." Director's cut.
Absolute classic.
- Hey.
They've been at it like that...
like cats and dogs... for weeks.
You all right, Dad?
Yes, yes, yes.
You got our Wimbledon tickets
sorted yet?
'Cause, you know,
I don't wanna miss
your grand finale.
Interesting bit of trivia actually.
I've never won a match at Wimbledon
with my family in attendance.
We're not invited?
No.
- She's not gonna like that.
- What won't I like?
Hello, darling.
You're looking rather gaunt.
Thank you.
Why is Dad so upset?
Oh. Ridiculous man.
For some reason, he believes
I'm having an affair with Eliot Larkin.
Mother. He saw you snogging
in the club car park.
Well, that would do it.
Not in the kitchen.
I wanted your father to see us.
That was the point.
Shake him out of his stupor,
compel him to act.
I hear you're planning to retire
to babysit a bunch of old ladies.
Not what your father and I
had in mind all those years ago
cheering you on.
And do you know why?
Because I believe you to be
a truly great tennis player.
Oh, God.
You've just always been afraid
to admit it to yourself.
I'm not afraid.
I'm old.
Oh, don't be absurd.
Thirty-one is not old.
It is in tennis years.
I might as well be your age.
Thank you, dear.
And I'm tired of hotels,
and I'm tired of airports...
and long-distance love affairs
that never go anywhere and...
- Losing?
- Yeah, losing. Thanks, Carl.
Now tell her about the tickets.
Tickets?
Oh, God. You really are
a wanker, aren't you?
Harsh but fair.
Why doesn't he have the tickets?
I mean, do you know why?
What does he think?
Does he think
we're going to sit here
watching it on television?
- Dad, what are you doing up there?
I should've moved up here
years ago.
Right. Well, I'm off
up to Wimbledon then.
Righto.
Peter.
Yeah.
Remember I always told you
that tennis was a gentleman's game?
Yeah.
Total bollocks.
Everything I ever told you...
total bollocks.
Right then.
- Welcome to the Dorchester, Mr. Colt.
- Thank you.
You have a suite, top floor.
Wonderful view.
Really, I think
you might have made a...
- Thank you.
Wow.
Well, they weren't wrong
about the view.
You need something?
Yeah, l...
I'm so sorry.
I was given the key to Room 1221.
This is Room 1221...
my 1221.
Oh, right. Your 1221.
Well, that makes perfect sense.
- What makes perfect sense?
- You see, I'd reserved a more modest room.
Now I'll go down
to the front desk and...
thank them for this dreadful error.
Good-bye then.
Yes, good-bye. And may
I say good body... Luck!
Shit. I meant...
Shit.
Oh. Lovely kitchen.
This way.
See now? That's much cozier.
Yeah. I get a lot of questions
about my personal life.
- I usually don't answer them.
- That's why
it's called a personal life.
Right. I mean, I just want
to focus on my game, you know?
Unfortunately... I have to agree
with my dad on this one...
all that other stuff
just gets in the way.
But, Lizzie, you have had problems
with chair umpires this year.
Some of the players think
you go out of your way
to disrupt a match.
I really don't.
I mean, you know,
maybe I go a little
over the top sometimes,
but, you know, maybe that's what
I need to do to play my best.
And that's why I came to London...
to win Wimbledon.
We'll be watching.
Good luck.
Gonna knock 'em dead this year, Peter?
That's the idea, Danny.
I've got a strong feeling.
Thanks, Danny.
Gonna knock 'em dead
this year, Ivan?
I'll do my best for you.
I've got a strong feeling.
- See you later.
- Hey, Dieter. You wanna go for dinner?
Afraid not. There's a chance
I may get lucky tonight.
Oh, really?
Intriguing Irish girl.
Her father owns much of Dublin.
Excellent.
She have a sister?
Only child.
Tragic.
I should stay
and work on my serve anyway.
This is my last hurrah.
I wanna go out in style.
Well, that's the spirit, old man.
Bugger.
Oops.
Sorry. Wrong court.
Forgotten me already?
God, no. You're the lady
with the lovely... kitchen.
Uh-huh.
Lizzie Bradbury, right?
And you're?
Peter. Peter Colt.
Nice to meet you,
Peter Peter Colt.
- Five quid says you can't do it again.
- Mm-hmm.
Ten bucks says
you can't hit two in a row.
You're on.
Lovely form.
Thank you.
Hmm. You're exceeding
my expectations.
Mine too.
Do it with a slice serve,
I'll treat you to fish-and-chips.
Ooh. The pressure's on.
Lovely toss.
- Fish-and-chips it is then.
- Lizzie, sweetheart,
what the heck are you doing?
- Oh, just one more serve, Daddy.
- You gotta be back in the hotel
in 20 minutes for an interview.
Two seconds, okay?
It's funny. You don't seem
the "Daddy" type.
Hit this one,
and I'll sleep with you.
- I'm so sorry!
Too bad. You could've
used the workout.
Hello, and welcome to day one
of the championships,
where the players meeting
on center court today...
include Andy Roddick,
Serena Williams...
and Britain's best hope for a title,
Tom Cavendish.
Other Brits in action include
journeyman veteran Peter Colt.
And today marks
the Wimbledon debut
of American Lizzie Bradbury.
We'll see if she can live up
to her lively reputation.
What are you talking about?
The chalk flew up.
There's a mark right there.
- The ball was out.
- Get on with it!
You know what,
I'll let it go.
'Cause you obviously can't see it,
and I feel sorry for you.
30-15.
Quiet, please.
40-15.
Yes!
How are you doing?
What time's your match?
3:00. Ajay Bhatt.
You ever heard of him?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's sitting over there.
Look.
Oh, my God.
Shouldn't he be off
discovering masturbation or something?
Played him at Bogota.
He's like all young men...
out to destroy us,
to kill the father.
And like all young men,
he must first be taught
the lesson ofhumility.
Exactly. And you taught him
that lesson in Bogota?
Sadly, no. He killed the father...
straight sets.
Watch out for his backhand.
Twenty pound to win...
Ajay Bhatt.
Hold on. Hold on.
Isn't he playing your brother?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Yeah, but, curiously, I'm not.
So this is it.
This is the end.
This is what it looks like.
1,000 balls a day,
300 days a year, for 25 years.
Six million balls.
And it all ends here,
at 2:00 in the afternoon
on Court 17...
while they're over on center court
screaming for the latest
Russian teenage beauty.
Well, let's see if I can at least
make it last a little while.
Ajay.! Come on, Ajay.!
- Good luck, Mr. Colt.
- Thank you.
Bhatt to serve.
First set.
Right then.
Play.
- Love-15.
Okay, nice. Not embarrassing.
Another 71 like it,
and you've got it in the bag.
Oi.! Bloody rabbit.! Shoo.!
We have our first match point.
Yes.! Come on.
I must say he's playing with
newfound confidence today.
Yes.
So here we are...
match point.
Yes.! Come on.! Get it.!
Yes.! Good shot.!
Well done.! Come on.!
Come on.! Yes.!
That's it.!
He's done it.!
He's done it.!
He's through round one!
Not interested.
What?
Not interested.
Oh, suit yourself.
So you think that kid
has a future.
Yes, I do.
I expect, one day, to be
the answer to the trivia question:
Who beat Ajay Bhatt
in his first ever Grand Slam?
What Wimbledon is this
for you, Peter?
It's my 13th actually.
And since this may well be my last
Wimbledon press conference,
um, I'd like to take the opportunity
to announce my retirement from...
Jake.!
Please. Come on, man.
tennis.
That's my retirement from tennis...
effective the moment
this tournament ends.
Lizzie!
Tomorrow morning, I want you
at the rear entrance, 9:00 sharp.
We can avoid all of this,
all right?
Yeah, you're probably right.
Excuse me, ladies, if you please.
Come on, sweetheart.
Hey, Lizzie! Lizzie!
- Jake.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How's your injury?
You have one new message.
Congratulations.
You still owe me fish-and-chips.
Uh, say, 7:00?
Room 1221.
That's my 1221.
Oh, bollocks!
It's open.
... kuiper belt appears tonight
in the northern sky.
Once mistaken for a shooting star,
the comet gained its name...
from two U.S. servicemen
on patrol in the South Pacific.
It's the first time in 67 years
it's appeared...
and will be visible
to the naked eye
for the next two weeks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh, two fish-and-chips,
as promised.
Um... 
What?
Let me just...
Oh, geez.
How embarrassing.
get this.
Are you hungry?
Um, not quite.
I've got a question for you.
All right.
Where do you come down on
the whole "fooling around
before a match" issue?
Well, that's a very intriguing question.
'Cause I think a little fooling around
can be really good for your game.
You know, help you relax.
Um, I'm not sure
I've done enough research
to have a definitive opinion.
That's very sad.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
It is... very sad.
Don't get me wrong. I'm...
very interested in doing
the necessary research.
Are you?
I'm interested.
Peter?
No one
can know about this, okay?
Really? I had been planning
a brief press statement.
Seriously. Especially my dad.
He's convinced, if there's a guy around,
my first serve gets mushy.
Well, you can't win Wimbledon
with a mushy serve.
No. So... we'll keep it light.
Okay?
Absolutely fine with me.
We'll just keep it, you know,
fun and... relaxed.
Relaxed.
Good.
Peter?
Excellent.
More research.
And that's another point lost.
The truth is that Dragomir...
seems to have completely
seized control on this court,
known as
"the graveyard of champions."
For some reason,
Peter Colt's game
this afternoon...
has been less than inspired.
Oh, God! Oh, God, I'm tired.
I'm so tired.
Of course you are.
Stay up all night doing research,
you're bound to be.
Game... Dragomir.
What a pity.
Dragomir leads five games to four
in the fourth set and by two sets to one.
Come on, Peter.
Hello! Do you mind?
Bugger. He was doing so well.
I wouldn't write him off
just yet, Pauline.
Some young men, I find,
have a stamina that's...
really quite deceptive.
The second round.
That's not so bad.
He did win the French Open.
At least you got three games off him.
Three games?
Three lousy games?
Last match of your career,
and you got three games?
Time.
It's pathetic.
Come on, Peter.!
Well, at least there's no one here
to see you lose.
Come on, Peter.!
Oh, great.
Come on, Pete.!
Love-15.
Who would have thought, 40 minutes ago,
that we'd be in a fifth set?
But here, Peter Colt...
who hasn't beaten a top-10 player
in the past two years, remember...
is at 5-4, three points
from winning the match.
30-love.
- You were with me last match.
- Yes, sir. Brilliant play, sir.
- Do you think I could trouble you...
- Sorry.
- 40-love.
And we have our first match point.
- Out!
- Game, set, match... Colt.
Incredibly,
the English wild card, Peter Colt,
has defeated the French Open champion
to advance to the third round.
- Three sets to two: :
6- 4, 4-6, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4.
I thought I'd done
my last one of these.
So did we.
So did we. Yeah.
 Peter, did you know
that Dragomir is the first seeded player
you've defeated in three years?
Yes. Uh, two months and 14 days.
But who's really counting?
What, uh... What do you think
of your next opponent?
Truthfully, in all the excitement,
I haven't even checked
to see who it is.
It's your practice partner.
Dieter Prohl.
So two friends must now
face each other as enemies.
An intriguing existential dilemma.
Room 1221, please.
Right.
Is your elbow playing up?
Well, if I admit to that,
you may use it to your advantage.
Wow. That's terrible.
Is that what our friendship's come to?
Dodgy shoulder maybe?
The truth is, most everything aches.
What doesn't, I can't feel at all.
Tell me about it. Hello?
Hello? Mm!
We should still
practice together.
We must stick
to the routine.
The hotel offered me a better room.
I told them I'm on a roll at the moment
and I'm not changing rooms.
At such moments,
our superstitions are all we have.
Exactly.
Even when I'm taking a shit,
I must do it exactly the same.
I'd never thought of that.
That's genius.
You think of everything important...
you do it the same.
Oh, wait a minute.
Yeah. Oh, that's okay.
Put me through.
Lizzie, listen, don't say a word.
I was thinking a repeat
of the other night...
like fish-and-chips,
early to bed.
Sh... Mr. Bradbury, hello.
Mr. Bradbury?
Damn.
Yeah?
Yeah.
- Peter.
- Billi.
Come stai?
You are the Dragomir slayer.
How are you?
You look a million... lira.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
I try.
Do you know my partner, Sophia?
No. Hi.
Nice to meet you.
So?
I'm looking
for Lizzie Bradbury.
Have you seen her?
No. Maybe you should ask
Jake Hammond.
Oh, really? Why?
Why do you think?
Oh, right.
Ah.
Well, I'd better
get a move on. Ciao.
Good luck tomorrow.
Thank you.
Looking for someone?
- Yeah. Ye-Yes.
- Wouldn't happen
to be my daughter?
Yes, it would.
It's Colt, right?
Yes, but please call me Peter.
Lizzie's on a roll right now,
and I don't want her
to have any distractions.
Right. Of course.
S-Sorry. Just to clarify.
Do you see me as a distraction?
That's exactly how I see you.
So stop looking for her.
Stop calling her.
Stop coming around.
Stop every damn thing
that involves my daughter.
Is that clear?
 I suppose,
in a few thousand years,
the English will evolve webbed feet.
Yes. Just about the same time
the first German evolves
a sense of humor.
No, no, no. That's unfair.
Many times, I make you laugh.
No. I'm laughing at you,
not with you.
Ha ha.
Somebody wants you.
Oh, you know what?
I think I'll...
I think you will too.
See? Now that was quite funny.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, get some rest tonight.
I don't wanna win too easily,
what with you and that,
what is it, bad knee?
I have a little confession
to make.
Oh, God.
When you, uh, walked
into my room the other day,
I knew exactly
who you were.
You did?
Mm-hmm.
I saw you play Tommy Haas
at the Lipton last year.
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
You were ahead,
but then you totally
fell apart, remember?
Yes. I recall the ball girl couldn't
get out of the way of my serve.
You gallantly carried her
off the court.
I thought you were such a...
asshole.
To lose like that when you
were playing so beautifully?
I couldn't get it out of my head.
I kept hoping I'd run into you.
Until finally you walked
into my hotel room.
Like a knight in shining armor
perhaps?
No.
Trouble is, I'm the one
that needs saving.
Yesterday, I was losing,
and then I saw you watching.
What?
Perhaps my first serve's
getting a little mushy.
Mm-hmm.
This year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waitin'on my own
Too long
When you hold me
like you do
Oh. Hey, look.
There it is, the comet.
See, with the little tail
behind it?
Hardly anything, is it?
Barely moving.
We have to wish on it.
Did you wish
on your next match?
It wouldn't work
if I told you.
Who do you play?
Good friend of mine actually.
Dieter Prohl.
A friend? Then you should know
how to beat him.
What are his weaknesses?
Um, sausages, Wagner,
men in leather shorts.
In his game. That's why I gave up
having girlfriends in tennis.
You have to dig extra deep
to kill your friends.
Now I have to kill him?
Without thinking twice.
And I don't envy you.
Why's that?
You practice together,
you travel together,
you practically live together.
Do you really have what it takes
to close out a friend
in the third round of Wimbledon?
Because that is killing him.
It's a bullet to the heart.
That's what's tough
about this game.
There's a winner,
and there's a loser.
And tomorrow, one of you
is going to be a loser.
Bloody pedals!
All right. Vij.
Wh-Where the hell
are the men's matches?
Man, Roddick lost toJake Hammond
in four sets, mate.
Shit. What about Peter
and Prohl?
Didn't hear?
No.
Straight sets, man.
Pete decimated him.
Tore him to pieces, man.
Shit!
Oh, what, you bet
against him again?
You know, that bastard
usually comes through for me.
He's been on such
a good losing streak.
Here. Are you, uh,
Peter Colt's brother?
Possibly.
I've seen you in here
watchin' the matches.
Yeah.
- You could say tennis is my life.
- My passion's chat rooms.
Really? Hmm.
Broadband.
Of course.
You may have humiliated the kraut,
but you're not done with him.
You change your routine
not one iota.
I'm still your practice partner.
Thanks, mate.
Anyway, you know it was
a hell of a lot closer than the score.
A let-cord here or there,
it would have been a different story.
Bullshit.
You annihilated me.
You...
You hit from the soul,
the heart.
Something's happened to you.
Something else, something...
The girl in the taxi.
The-The end of the waving hand.
That's...
That's where the fire comes from.
Admit it.
Dieter, listen.
Do you think that,
in the middle of a championship...
and for the first time in years
I'm actually winning,
I'd be dumb enough
to get involved with a woman?
Absolutely.
You have eight new messages.
Well, aren't I popular?
Peter. lan Frazier from the club.
Well done.! Take as long as you need
before you start with us.
Oh, and the, uh... the ladies
send their regards.
You were incredible today.
I have a free day tomorrow.
I'll call you later.
Peter, remember me?
It's your mother.
- I hear congratulations are in order.
- What did I always say about ya?
I don't know. Remind me, Ron.
So, uh, cucumber and cucumber?
And cucumber.
They forgot to put
the sandwich in my sandwich.
What are you doing here, Ron?
You're not still my agent, are you?
What are you talkin' about?
What am I talking about?
Okay, well, I called you
about a year ago,
and I'm still waiting
for you to return my call.
Yeah, I'm into e-mails now.
I don't do the, uh,
phone thing anymore.
Ron? That's a lie.
Yeah, it's a lie.
You want me to be
completely honest with you?
Agents are not miracle workers.
We can't sell a product
that doesn't exist.
But here you are existing again,
so I'm back selling again.
You know what, Ron?
I genuinely despise you.
And you know what, Peter?
I really don't take it personally.
Because this could all
be over by Monday.
Cavendish is a serve-and-volley guy,
and you've always played shit
against them,
so I'd like to capitalize now
if that's not a problem with you.
I don't want you
to go down in history...
as that English guy who beat
his best friend, the German guy,
only to get beat
by the other English guy.
I'd like to put some money
in your pocket.
You got a problem with that?
You'd have to cut your commission.
Okay, look, unfortunately
that's a no-go area.
Everybody pays 10% .
Say five percent,
or the next offer's four.
You know, success
has really changed you.
And I'm loving it.
Screw it. You got a deal.
Besides, I have a funny feeling
that Cavendish is going down.
Tea?
Yes. I'd love some.
Now let's get down to business.
Slazenger's having a cocktail party
this evening,
and everybody's dying to meet you
for the very first time... all over again.
- I have a thing later. I'll call you back.
- I'll ring you tomorrow.
That's fine. Tomorrow's fi...
Lizzie.
Ronny.
There she is.
How they hangin'?
Fine. And yours?
Fine. Who's your new friend?
You going to introduce me?
You haven't met yet?
Hi. I'm Lizzie.
Peter. Peter Colt.
"The" Peter Peter Colt?
- The one and only.
- Oh, I've heard a lot about you.
Oh, really? Nothing good, I hope.
That you're a man who's not afraid
to come to the net.
I hear that this is your first Wimbledon,
and you're gonna go all the way.
Every chance I get.
Well, well, well.
If this works out,
do I get the, uh...
You can have 10%
of our kids.
The kids. That's a... 
Are you all right?
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You come along and play matchmaker?
Did I do that? I'm sorry.
I just got excited by the math.
Let's just have a drink.
We can talk over this whole Nike thing,
and you'll still have her home
before she turns into a pumpkin.
One day,
none of this will be ours.
Oh, no.
Asshole incoming. 4:00.
Lizzie, what's the deal?
I've left you, like,
half a dozen messages.
Oh, really?
How about that?
Hi.
Do you know Peter Colt?
Yeah, we did meet once.
First round, San Jose, last year.
Exactly.
A memorable match.
Yeah, which I, like, won.
Peter's in the quarters.
Did you hear?
Wait a second.
Are you screwing him?
- You know what?
- You are, aren't you?
I don't believe this.
Listen, my friend, we don't want...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you,
grandpa, ranked, like, 120?
I thought all those things
they said about you were just rumors,
but you really are a cheap little...
- Oh!
Jesus! That really hurts.
But you did it so well.
 Are you all right, sir?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Good night, Jake.
Hey, yes, don't get up.
Leave me alone.!
I'm fine.!
That's the first time I've ever
hit anybody in my whole life.
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
Other side. Other...
I've never had anyone
fight for my honor before.
I kinda like it.
Jesus Christ! You're not safe to be with.
Wait till you see me drive.
So, these are
the wild streets of my youth.
The drugs, the sex, the milk shakes.
My parents live here,
and I still keep a flat.
Oh, so we can
stay there tonight.
Yeah. But what about your dad?
Aw, let him find his own place.
Parents are such a responsibility.
I know.
They're worse than children.
Oh, definitely.
My parents got divorced
when I was 13.
My mom was always on the road
trying to be a singer.
What went wrong?
She couldn't sing.
So mainly my dad brought me up.
Mine are still together.
Which proves that
love's not just blind,
it's bloody stupid.
It's sad.
Everything they used to love in each other
now seems to drive them crazy.
I can't imagine
ever wanting to get married.
No. No.
I mean, that's why
we love the tour, isn't it?
There's always another country,
another airport.
Another girl.
That's right, Leslie.
Lizzie. I meant Lizzie.
Ow, ow. I meant...
You said "Leslie."
Who's Leslie?
As you can see, we've, uh,
we've had to fire the builders
due to creative differences.
And truthfully, Peter's had
a little bit of a liquidity problem.
Oh, my nan liked to drink.
Sherry.
Right.
Piccy?
Just a bitty.
- Carl, what are you doing?
- Uh, Pete. Hi.
Um, wasn't expecting to see you.
And... Shit! That's Lizzie Bradbury.
Can I take a picture?
No, you bloody can't.
- It's digital.
- Look what I found.
Oh, hello.
Give me that.
Who are you?
Oh, I only got four pizzas.
Oh, for God's sake!
Right. That's it. Get out.
Come on.
You too, sunshine.
Bugger!
I had it on "Landscape."
Stop it. It's not funny.
I'm sorry.
Move it.!
Change of venue, girls.
Children out!
Come on.
- Big fan.
- Come on.
Leave.
I am so sorry.
Might wanna
change the sheets.
- Hi, Daddy. It's me.
I know you're probably going nuts
and wanna kill me.
But everything's cool.
Really.
Um, it's hard to explain,
but I really needed to do this.
And... I gotta go.
I'll... I'll see you at practice
in the morning.
- Everything all right?
- Everything's great.
Aren't we gonna have a workout?
I thought we just had one.
Now, are you sure about this?
I usually do 10 miles.
- Why are you running behind me?
- I'm just enjoying the view.
Snip by snip
I'm oozin'it bit by bit
Yeah
I'm takin'it step-by-step
Boy, here and now
We're caught in a moment
And I won't let it go
And the silence
It belongs to you and I
Hey, look at that.
This is where
my dad taught me to play tennis.
Huh.
Look at it now.
It's a shame.
Yeah.
Ace!
Come on. Make a little effort.
Ace!
What's the matter with you?
Are you scared of a girl?
- There's something
I haven't told you.
- What?
This is my last tournament,
no matter what happens.
But you're doing so great.
- Hey, you just have to...
- Keep winning.
Right. So keep winning.
Oh, finally.
Colt returns with a somewhat demure
crosscourt forehand.
Ah.! Colt makes a smashing return.
With unladylike effort,
Bradbury strains
to get to the ball.
Oh.! It's an extremely high lob.
Will he maintain
his gentlemanly composure,
or will he... dare I say...
win the point?
 Hold on.
What's happened to the ball?
Look.
Gotta go. Good-bye.
Hundred quid on Cavendish
in the quarters.
Hold your horses.
So, still bettin'
against your brother, are ya?
It's tactical. If he loses, I get rich.
And if he wins, I get laid.
Where the heck did you get
a hundred quid anyway?
Photojournalism.
I trust you slept well
after your night of debauchery
with young master.
I declare, I surely did.
Good. So did I.
God.
No wonder the English
never win Wimbledon.
I'd love to see an English guy
in the finals, but give me a break.
Peter Colt is the luckiest man
in tennis.
Oh. Wanker.
God, it's incredible how much
that actually looks like your dad.
Oh, shit.
Incredible how much
that building...
Shit!
Shit!
Quick.! Hide.!
Oh, Carl! You bastard!
Oh, hello. Mr. Bradbury.
Where's my daughter?
She... Gone, sadly.
Sadly, gone.
She had to go and work
on that first serve.
I expect she meant to meet you
at the practice courts.
Are you bullshitting me?
Absolutely not.
I'd never bullshit you.
I wouldn't dream of it.
So, how was your trip down?
The traffic can be murder
getting out of London.
We left early.
Well, the early bird
does catch the worm.
Uh, wou-would you like
a cup of, uh, tea?
Maybe something stronger.
A shot of whiskey.
A shot at me.
It's Peter, right?
Yeah.
Look, Peter, I got nothing
against you personally.
- You seem like a nice guy, and, uh...
- Oh, good.
I'm not an idiot.
I know that Lizzie likes to...
have her fun.
And it keeps her relaxed.
Um, if you were just
another easy...
You know.
Well, that would be one thing.
But you're not, are you?
As a matter of fact,
I was incredibly easy.
No, no.
This time, it's different.
She's... falling for you.
- Oh, I see.
- Which is a total disaster.
But why?
She's hardly lost a set. l...
Look, her footwork is off.
Her serve is a mess.
She's gotta get her head
back in the game.
She's gotta remember
what it is that she wants.
And what do you think that is?
What we've been working towards
all these years,
what she's always wanted
more than anything.
- I still want it.
- Oh. Hi.
I want to win Wimbledon.
I'm sorry.
That's all right, sweetheart.
Well, we'd better get going.
We got a lot of work to do.
- You're gonna go?
- Yeah. He's right.
I'm sorry.
Wait a second.
- Lizzie?
Lizzie.!
Lizzie, this is ridiculous.
You're a grown woman, and you should
be making your own decisions.
This is my decision.
We can be together
after the tournament.
After the tournament?
What does that mean?
You can't just switch me on and off
like a bloody lightbulb.
I'll call you at the hotel.
She won't be at the hotel.
What?
I'm sorry, kid, but...
If you're together,
she can't play.
- Tom.! Tom.! Tom.!
- Well, this may be an all-British affair,
but Tom Cavendish is clearly in control
of the crowd and the match today.
He's up a break in the first set,
and Peter Colt... with the expectations
of an entire nation upon him...
seems to be withering
under the pressure.
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
- 40-love.
So that's set point
for Tom Cavendish.
Linda, to the patio door.
Well, talk to Sergei.
She hits short,
you come in.
Daddy, stop bugging me.
She'll never pass you.
I'm focused.
I know the game plan.
Yeah, right.
He's out of my head now.
It's over.
Stop freaking out on me.
Oh, yeah.
It was definitely his ankle.
You can see how he landed right on it.
This is ugly.
- Cavendish.! Cavendish.! Cavendish.!
Peter Colt may havejust
got himself a free pass to the semis.
- Think you can go on?
Not so fast, Chrissy.
Listen to the crowd.
They worship the kid here.
The question is, will Colt be able
to take advantage of Tom Cavendish?
He's never shown
much of a killer instinct.
Quiet, please.
- 40-love.
- There's your answer, John.
Look at that smile.
Watch out, Tom Cavendish.
Can we take another route?
Her match is at 3:00.
I doubt it. It's a chocker.
What's the score, sweetheart?
It's match point.
 Game point.
He's done it.!
Peter Colt has done it again.!
Another upset.
Another seeded player goes down,
and Colt will now take on
fifth seed Pierre Maroux
in the semifinals on Friday.
Congratulations, my friend.
Thank you, but I think
my countrymen hate me.
What?
I've just destroyed their best hopes
of winning a championship.
Oh, ridiculous.
Everyone loves a winner.
Everybody but the British.
Thank you.
See, I was right.
Everything's good.
Everybody loves you.
Almost everybody.
30-all.
What do you think
makes her so extraordinary?
No embarrassment, no fear.
She makes a decision,
she goes for it, all pistons firing.
It's a turn-on for the rest of us
'cause most of the time, let's face it,
we're all scared shitless.
Even you, Ron?
Me? I hate making a decision.
Like right now,
I'm very, very afraid.
If you don't see that girl again,
it's going to mess with your head,
screw up your confidence.
On the other hand, I'm terrified...
I'm petrified that if I tell you
where that girl is camped out,
her father's gonna fire my ass.
Where's the girl camped out, Ron?
32 Kensington Place.
First-floor apartment.
I made a decision.
Game... Miss Bradbury.
Miss Bradbury wins final set.
Me too.
Oh, shh. Shh.
No. No. Hi.
Shh.
- Now, listen. It's not
what you think, so don't start...
I'll jump. I'll jump.
I will. You want that
on you conscience?
- Thank you.
Lizzie? Lizzie?
Lizzie, it's me.
 Shit!
Hey! Shut up!
Noisy little shit.
Oh...
That hurt.
- Bugger!
- Peter.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?
- That's an excellent question.
That sad fact of the matter is,
I can't seem to get through
24 hours without you.
I missed you,
Peter Peter Colt.
You have?
But I need you to go.
No, you need me to stay.
Peter.
Lizzie.
Peter.
Lizzie.
People have fallen in love
before, you know.
Oh. Is that what
we're doing here?
Good thing you didn't
get the wrong room.
I did, but your dad's
a very quick shag.
 Good morning.!
BBC London 94.9.
The lark's on the wing
and everything's for the best...
in this best of all possible worlds,
'cause it's semifinals day.
Which means it can only get better
as Peter Colt stares down the racket
of Pierre Maroux.
Game point.
 Whoa.! Peter Colt must have had
his Wheaties this morning.
He's off to a roaring start.
 But remember, Chrissy,
the last time these two met...
was in '97 U.S. Open semis,
a day I'm certain Peter Colt
wants to wipe from the memory banks.
 No kiddin'. It was the greatest
opportunity of Colt's career.
He was up two sets,
and then he completely choked.
And I don't think he's ever
fully recovered from it.
You know, John, choking can be
instigated by the smallest thing.
 Absolutely.
You wake up in the morning,
and something just isn't right.
Or maybe a little superstition
you have goes wrong.
And a seed of self-doubt is planted.
Lizzie.! I love you.!
Then everywhere you look,
that feeling of doubt seems to be
looking right back at you.
Once that happens,
all it takes is one point.
One decisive point that
can make or break your confidence...
and completely determine
the outcome of a match.
- Game... Miss Rupesindhe.
- Advantage... Colt.
Well, there's no trophy here today
on number two court.
Peter Colt
is firmly in control.
Thank you.
And incredibly, just two points away...
from the Wimbledon final on Sunday
against America's Jake Hammond.
Come on, Pete.!
Quiet please.
- That was an almost
impossible passing shot. Match point.
- Yes!
And he seems to be
having trouble getting up
from that awkward tumble just now.
Peter Colt's clearly in pain.
- Shit.
- It's hard to tell.
This could spell disaster for the man
who's captured the hearts...
Come on, Son. Come on. Come on.
Pick yourself up. You can do it.
Mr. Colt, are you okay?
It's my back.
Can you get up?
I'm not entirely sure.
One more point. Come on.
He can't actually hear you.
- Oh, yes, he can.
- This is an eerie echo
of the Tom Cavendish match.
- Well, he's back on his feet.
- Oh, yes, he can.
- Well, only he knows
how much it's hurting him.
- Oh, my God! The stress.
How does he deal with it?
How does who deal with it?
Oh, my back!
My back is killing me.
But remember you're one point
away from the finals.
I'd love to see an English guy
in the finals, but give me a break.
Do you remember Australia?
Your shoulder was killing you,
and what did you do then?
All right. All right. All right!
Peter Colt is the luckiest man in tennis.
This is gonna hurt.
Game, set, match... Colt.
Colt wins three sets to love: :
6- 2, 6-1, 6-3.
Yes!
I knew he could do it.
 Who would have bet, two weeks ago,
that the man time had forgotten,
 Rabbit. Caught it
messing with your lettuce.
Good man.
Congratulations, Peter.
Can we just do a quickie?
No, not right now.
How'd she do?
It's just one of those days
where I couldn't do anything wrong,
and Lizzie just couldn't
do anything right.
That would include accepting defeat,
which Ms. Bradbury found very difficult today.
Bugger.
It's not as if
she can blame you, is it?
I told you I needed to focus,
to be away from you
for just a few days.
But, no, instead you sneak into my room,
you don't even have the decency
to spend the night...
- I had the earliest start,
and I thought you'd want the extra sleep.
- I was some chick you picked up.
- Well, this chick is going back home
to work on her serve.
Lizzie, I am sorry about your match.
I really am. But please don't go.
Because you need
to screw me before the finals.
That's why you think I'm here?
It's not. Really, Peter?
Not even just a little bit?
Aha.! You see?
I know you want me to think...
that we're falling in love
or some bullshit,
but the only thing you
fell in love with this week was winning.
- That is absolutely not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.
And you know what? I love winning too.
More than anything. More than anyone.
- Don't say that. You don't mean it.
- I do.
Love means nothing in tennis.
Zero. It only means you lose.
She's dropping her arm
too soon after the toss.
Honestly
Can I say what I mean
Don't you play with me
'Cause I'm a lady
You must clear your head.
You must forget about her.
Love is shit, just like she said.
Yeah. He's absolutely right.
Just ask my soon-to-be ex-wife.
Ask all my ex-wives.
Thanks for the words of wisdom, Ron.
Shouldn't you be off sucking up toJake?
I took care of that
at breakfast.
You gave her a taste ofher medicine.
You're in the finals. It's time
to move on, same as she would.
I don't want to move...
Feel that?
Ow!
I'll take that as a yes.
Look, I'm not making any promises,
but if you keep relatively still,
you should be in a decent state
for the finals.
Yes.! We got it. Frito-Lay.
- What?
- You are the new spokesperson
for their brand-new chip.
Surprisingly Zesty, it's called.
That's you, pal.
- Oh, God. I've gotta get out of here.
- No. No way. You heard the good doctor.
Let's get you some room service.
I would kill for another dozen of those...
what do you call the...
those little cucumber sandwiches?
- Cucumber sandwiches.
- You Brits got a name
for everything, huh?
And in other news,
the kuiper belt comet
Armstrong-Flynn...
finally disappeared from view today
after blazing for nearly a...
There's a distance between us
And you take the blame
I know that you tried
but at this stage of the game
 I've started a new life
There's no turning back
Why, Jennifer?
Will you now
Don't you know
Can't you see
I get over
Sometimes I wonder
Where this feeling began
Deep in my heart
right from the start
Right from the start
Tired and lonely
I move on from this pain
I'm starting again
I'm breakin'the chain
Yeah, all right. I'm going.
I'm going.
Oh, for God's sake, Carl.
Carl!
For God's sake, what...
Didn't I tell you always to knock
before entering a room?
Well, it's a bit late now.
You better come in and have some
breakfast. What do you want?
Eggs and soldiers?
- Oh, eggs will be fine.
- Sit down.
Morning, Son.
Where's the marmalade?
Well, uh,
I'm out of the tree house.
Yeah, you certainly are.
Your mother and I seem to have found
some common ground at long last.
- Oh, really. What's that?
- You, Peter.
You're, uh, probably aware
that things have been a bit
sticky for the last few,
well, years actually.
The fact is that, uh,
in the end, the only thing we shared
was the downstairs toilet,
and she wasn't really keen on that.
I think what I'm trying to say is that...
we'd forgotten just what
an inspiration you are to both of us.
That's meant to be
the other way around actually, I know.
But how very proud we are of you.
It's been a long time since
we've done this.
Too bloody long.
Dad?
Hmm?
My back.
Oh, God.
Well, it's been quite
a fortnight, hasn't it?
Not just for Peter,
but for all of us.
I, for one, will admit...
and that's not a word I like very much.
But we could all do better...
to love and support
each other unconditionally.
Without judgment, without...
- For God's sake, Carl, stop biting
your fingernails. You're not a bloody infant!
- Augusta!
- You were saying, darling?
- Yes, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to propose a toast.
To the family. Our family.
It's a trick.
Our family.
Our family.
Oh, bloody marvelous.
No, darling. We're bad luck.
If we came and you lost,
I would never be able
to forgive myself.
I don't believe in luck anymore.
Listen, win or lose,
and I can't see how
I'm possibly going to win,
tomorrow will be my last
professional tennis match.
And I can't imagine the three of you
not being there. So, please.
So what you're saying is
Jake's the safe bet then.
Good morning. It's Radio 1
at 7:00. I'm Chris Moyles.
So today's the day.
It's the big finals.
Peter Colt, what an amazing man.
Who would have thought?
I didn't think he was gonna do it.
Now, I'm starting to think...
Morning, everyone. BBC London 94.9.
And it's here. It is Wimbledon finals day.
I'll try to be detached,
I try to be cool, but I'm carried away.
Come on, Colty.!
Good luck, Mr. Colt.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
All the best, Mr. Colt.
Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
An Englishman in the final.
Fantastic!
If you could win that cup, sir,
we'd all be so proud.
I'll do my best.
And I don't even like tennis.
 Ready, sir?
Yeah, I think I am.
 Peter Colt, seen here in his teens,
has already declared this to be
his last competitive match.
And what an exit.
Only a matter of days ago,
Colt had become no more
than a fading blip on the radar
of tennis history.
Now he's become the man who...
Not to add the pressure, Peter,
but you know the entire United Kingdom
is cheering you on today.
Yes. Well, let's hope
I don't disappoint them.
Did you have any realistic hope
two weeks ago that you would
be here today preparing to walk onto...
Lizzie, I love you more than life itself,
but I can't turn off every goddamned
television set in the United Kingdom.
I'm going for a walk.
Flight board's in half an hour.
 What do you attribute this
remarkable run to?
You were supposed
to make a very early exit.
Well, I had a bit of luck against
Tom Cavendish in the quarters,
and I played a more focused game...
passionate game, uh...
I suppose the real answer
to your question is, uh,
well, love really.
Love of the game?
Yeah, love of the game. Um...
But, listen, you may have read about
Lizzie Bradbury and myself...
being involved, so to speak.
But, um, I'd like to take this opportunity
to set the record straight.
I read the papers this morning,
and, uh, they seem to imply...
that Lizzie had let me down
in some way.
That's just not the case.
The truth is I let her down.
I let her down, and for that...
I'll always be truly sorry.
Listen, I'm not in the habit...
of pouring my heart out
on television.
I'm not really in the habit
of pouring my heart out at all.
Lizzie, sweetheart, something
I think you ought to see.
I'm seeing it.
So if this comes out wrong,
forgive me.
Lizzie Bradbury.
Lizzie is the reason that I'm here today.
That's all I really came here
to say except thank you.
Thank you, Peter.
I, uh, have a new theory
of our life of tennis.
Tell me.
Oh, it's simple really.
You hit the ball
back over the net...
as hard and as deep...
and as often
as possible.
Sorry to disturb you, Peter.
The members have invited you to use
the number one dressing room.
Oh, no. Thank you, Danny.
I think I'd rather stay here.
Right. That's what
I told 'em you'd say.
Good luck, my friend.
 In a few minutes, Colt and Hammond
will be making the walk...
through the tunnel
onto center court.
A little stroll, Chrissy, that I'm sure you'd
agree is about the number one highlight
of a tennis player's career.
 Except for the butterflies
I always felt, absolutely.
No, he can't just wear the hat.
No, we don't 'cause we don't
have an endorsement deal.
That's why.
Well, then he knows the number.
Peter.
I tried to warn you about her.
By the way,
how's the weak back?
It's fine. Thanks.
How's the weak mind?
 Gentlemen.
Fuck a duck.
Jake Hammond has been
on an absolute tear.
He's lost only one set
this entire tournament.
And look who he's had to beat.
Hewitt, Federer.
Well, with the exception
of Dragomir and Tom Cavendish,
Colt's road to this final
has been a relative pushover.
 Right. But he's played
some great tennis.
But my guess here is that he's more
than a little overmatched today.
First set. Hammond to serve.
I gotta go.
Peter! Peter! Peter!
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
Ready.
Play.
15-love.
Yes, thanks.
I'll be needing that.
He said, "Thanks.
I'll be needing that."
- Quiet please.
- Go, Jake! Come on, Jake.
30-love.
40-love.
Oh, that poor kid.!
He was on the receiving end
of one of the fastest-recorded
serves in professional tennis.
144 miles per hour.
 Well, we certainly
hope he's all right.
And that reminds me
how lucky I was, Chrissy.
I ball-boy'd in the old days
when they used wood rackets.
And things were a lot slower.
Oh, you bastard.
It's one thing to humiliate me,
but you didn't have to mess
with the boy.
Now you're going down,
you bastard.
- Or maybe not.
- Colt to serve.
Love-15.
Love-40.
Game... Hammond.
40-love.
Game and this set...
Hammond.
30-love.
Game... Hammond.
New balls, please.
Love-15.
Hammond leads five games to two.
Game... Hammond.
Love-30.
15-30.
15-40.
 Peter Colt finds himself
once again at break point.
He really can't afford to go down
another break this early in the third set.
He seems completely lost
out there, John.
 Lost and confused.
We may be witnessing...
the near total collapse
of a player's game.
At a moment like this, Chrissy,
you have to wonder...
what the hell is going through
Peter Colt's mind.
Please, God.
Please make it end.
Game... Hammond. Play suspended.
What are you doing, lad?
Get in here.
It ain't over
till the handshake, lad.
Danny, I'm not really in the mood
for a pep talk right now.
Well, you better
get ready for one.
Hi.
I thought you'd gone.
Yeah. Me too.
Having a tough day?
Well, you know, disastrous.
Except for the fact that you didn't
go gooey when the ball boy got hit.
Yeah. Sorry.
Why are you British
apologizing all the time?
Don't apologize to me.
I love you.
Apologize to the people
who are rooting for you out there.
What'd you say?
I said that the whole country
has been waiting...
No. No. The other bit.
I said I love you.
See, that's very good news.
I thought I was alone
in the love department.
Well, turns out
you've got company.
I am so sorry.
If you say sorry one more time,
you're going to be sorry.
I meant about the other night.
Shh! Stop it.
Forget about that.
This is about you.
Go out there and decide
who you are.
And who might that be?
That might be a winner.
Please be patient, Mr. Hammond.
Please sit down.
 The question is, where's Peter Colt?
Did he flee the building
with the rain?
I think he's in the lavatory.
Isn't that a comfort break?
Is it?
Yes. They are allowed one.
If he's got a jumpy tummy.
So, if he doesn't come back...
He's gonna lose.
Of course I want to win. I do.
But he's just better than me.
No. He's not.
I'm two sets down.
My back's killing me.
You're going to play through the pain.
I'm too tired.
My legs are like lead.
Find a second wind.
It's what winners do.
His serve is unstoppable.
No, it's not.
It's a bundle of tells.
- What?
- His serve.
It's like a book. You just
have to know how to read it.
You know I really don't care who wins.
I mean, I represent both players.
It's like asking me
which one of my kids I love more.
Which one of my kids
do I love more?
My daughter.
I'll talk to you later.
 Well, Peter Colt is back.
Let's hope he's better.
So far this match
has been a blowout.
Yeah, Pete! Peter!
Ladies and gentlemen,
as play resumes, Hammond leads...
two sets to love
and one game to love.
Hammond to serve. Play.
 Go, Pete.!
 lfhe bounces the ball once
instead of twice,
he's going for the body.
lfhe shifts back on his left heel
and shows you his toe,
it means he's hitting deep.
Colt sure seemed
to have Hammond's
number on that one, Chrissy.
Which is a good sign ifhe's
gonna climb out of the giant hole
he's dug himself.
Ouch. You all right?
Yeah.
Welcome back.
Same to you, sir.
Station ident ready to roll.
Eight, top of your shot.
We got a visitor.
John, did you see who just came in?
That'll give an immediate
adrenaline burst.
- Yes!
- He did it, Chrissy.
He pulled out the set.
Oh!
Yes!
 After a great comeback in the third set,
Colt's game has leveled.
And he and Jake Hammond
are even at 5-all in this tie-break.
So, John, this next point
is crucial...
if Colt wants to keep
this comeback alive.
Come on, Peter!
 Okay. 5-5 in the breaker.
Here we go.
6- 5... Hammond.
 Jake Hammond is up 6-5
in the tie-breaker,
and he's finally gotten himself
a championship point.
This could be the final point
of Peter Colt's pro career.
Right here, right now.
- Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
- This could be it, Chrissy.
l-lf his heel moves left,
he's going right.
Or is it the toss? Yes.
l-l-lf he tosses high, i-it...
Oh, sod it!
- 6-all.
- Incredible point.
I'm doin'a complete 180
on Peter Colt.
This is amazing persistence
from thejourneyman player.
I was already thinking
about gettin'to the airport.
We may be going to a fifth set,
and if I was Jake Hammond,
I'd want to close
this thing out right now.
The last thing he wants is another set
with the momentum going
in the other direction.
Okay. First one to win by two.
 Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
7- 6... Colt.
 Wow. A double fault.
Now it looks like Hammond's
the one who's getting tight.
Peter Colt now has set point
to force a fifth and deciding set.
- Aw, give us a goddamn break!
 Please, shut off
all mobile phones. Thank you.
Yeah.
 Unbelievable.!
We're gonna play five.!
Advantage... Colt.
Rising star Peter Colt
has battled back.
Game... Colt.
Peter Colt-san.
Game point.
Colt leads five games to four.
Final set.
 Well, Colt has broken Jake Hammond.
And after this changeover,
he's gonna be serving
for the Wimbledon title.
Listen, an hour ago,
I didn't think he'd find anybody
to give him a ride home.
No question, John.
And now it's all up to him.
I mean, he's finally got a chance
to serve out the match.
 Time.
Break you right back, asshole.
 Did you see that?
That is some definite gamesmanship
from Jake Hammond.
Come on, Peter.
15-love.
Come on!
 Peter Colt is now three points away
from winning Wimbledon.
One point at a time, Peter.
One point at a time.
It's just another point.
It's just another point.
Like hell it is. You could be
the champion of Wimbledon,
which means you wouldn't have to
take the pro job for starters.
You could buy a new place, redecorate.
Lizzie could help with that.
Oh, God knows
what taste she has.
Oh, shut up, you silly ponce.
- 30-love.
 Make that two points away, Chrissy.
- Come on, Peter.!
- Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
 Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Come on, Pete.
30-15.
Chrissy, we talked about
Colt's reputation in the past...
as a choker when
it comes to big points.
Well, this is primo choke time.
I wouldn't be surprised
if Colt got real tight now.
Thank you.
It's my fault.
 Peter.! Peter.! Peter.!
Don't choke. Don't choke.
Don't choke. Don't choke.
Please don't choke.
Please don't choke. Don't choke.
I'm not gonna choke, damn it.
40-15.
Peter.!
 Do you believe it? Peter Colt
is serving a championship point.
Quiet please.
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
Championship point.
Right then.
- Out.
- 40-30.
- I don't believe it.
That was a terrible call for Colt.
- No!
- What the hell?
- What?
- Look at the chalk fly.
The ball was definitely in.
- It was on the line.
- It was on the line!
I'd be torching
the stadium about now.
Excuse me!
The ball was good.
40-30.
Oh, come on. The ball was good.
Chalk flew up.
The whole stadium saw it.
I don't know if you've noticed,
but it's quite an important point.
That's too close for me to overrule.
Please resume play.
Absolutely not. I'm not playing.
This is complete bollocks.
- Absolutely bollocks.
- Code violation.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
Warning, Mr. Colt.
-  In.! In.! In.!
- Oh, my...
 Okay, here we go.
Peter Colt has his second chance now
to win the championship.
 The question is, can he do it?
After a call like that...
a lot of players,
including yours truly,
would have a hard time
getting back in the mind-set.
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
- That serve wasn't even close.
 It wasn't fast either.
 I believe you
to be a truly great tennis player.
- Ultimately disappointing.
- Total collapse of a player's...
 Stop it. You have to stop it.
Now.
Yes!
 He's done it.! He has done it.!
Thejourneyman has won.!
A wild card entry.
Ranked 119th in the world.
Now champion of Wimbledon.!
Call Letterman. Call Leno.
Call Oprah. Call Kimmel.
 It's utter pandemonium here.
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.
The Brits finally have a winner.
What's wrong with you?
You bet on Jake?
I bet it all on you, bro!
Can I retire now, Mum!
Certainly not!
Augusta!
Well done, Son. We love you.
 He seems to be lookin'
for somebody else.
 I think the whole world
knows who he's lookin'for.
There's so much
I want to say to you.
I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, yes, you are.
You're going a long, long way.
 Nothing could possibly
match that moment.
It's everything you wait
a lifetime for.
That dream finally come true.
What else could ever come close?
Except this, maybe.
I did take a job at a club.
But teaching young kids
like my own, not old ladies.
Yeah!
And I love it.
I beat you. I beat you.
Rubbish. The ball was in.
It was definite... Ow!
Well, most of the time.
You see, a part of me was always
afraid that my life would be over
if I wasn't playing tennis.
But the truth is, it was
reallyjust beginning.
Oh, and by the way,
Lizzie did win the U.S. Open.
And Wimbledon.
Twice.
