F or he neither has

And s o, o n my recommendatio n,

The truth is we do n't even

. . . Lajja S hanker is

You wi l l have to take another

Th is is Profess or

He is not a profess or b y profess io n,

Her past has broug ht such a

Mus htaq, the peop le who k now

These i n nocent kids who can become
Lajja S hanker's prey any day.
And y ou to o, for the sake of

It is useless for us,

Goddess Kal i speaks to me

And I obey al l her orders .
Lo ok i nto these eyes !
These are the eyes of
the messenger of God !
They are m irrors .
Smal ls kids can peep i nto them

These eyes are fu l l

Lo ok! Can they dream of

They want to see smal l kids

If my hands wou ld have

We have no clue about h is

We are help less .
We can't do anyth i ng without y ou .
So?
I k now that y ou have spent

There wi l l be many th i ngs

You are not as dumb

But how can I trust a

I want to hear th is from y our

Where, S ir?
To the H ome secretary's office.
Why, S ir? Because of y ou,
he asked me to put al l . . .
. . .my work as ide and

What have y ou do ne?
I haven't do ne anyth i ng !
We'l l k now about it
o nce we go there.
I wo nder what i nformatio n the
ACP has g iven h im agai nst y ou .
S ir, I do n't mean to say that
the ACP has wro ng i nformatio n .
Reeth must have said it.
But it's noth i ng new to bribe
o ne crim i nal to get another caug ht.
We have always been do i ng it.
Yes, we have been !
But with i n our l im its .
Before taki ng any such step we
seek the perm iss io n of our sen iors . . .
. . .or the H ome M i n ister.
We do n't m isuse the H ome M i n ister's
name and do as we l ike!
What does that g irl
th i nk about herself, S ir?
S ir, do y ou real ise that if
th is news that we have to . . .
. . .seek a petty crim i nal's help
to get our work do ne, spreads, . . .
. . . it wi l l be d ifficu lt for
us to face anybody.
The very newspapers wh ich
pri nt news about our fetes . . .
. . .wi l l cal l us eu nuchs !
You have g iven that g irl
u n necessary freedom .
The go vernment has a way of
worki ng, it has an image.
That g irl s hou ld have spoken to
the po l ice i nstead of speaki ng . . .
. . .to that crim i nal d irectly.
The po l ice wou ld have come to us, . . .
. . .we wou ld have spoken to
the M i n ister and he wou ld . . .
. . . have fou nd a way out.
S ir, I th i nk there is a lot of
d ifference i n our Modus Operend i .
That is why the H ome M i n istry has
decided to take th is case back.
I have spoken to the M i n ister.
The po l ice wi l l hand le th is case
i n their own way now.
You are comm itti ng a
grave m istake, S ir.
He is more worried about h is
false pride than a kid's l ife!
Ms . Reeth, s it outs ide u nti l
y ou are cal led .
You and y our entire po l ice force
can't nab Lajja S hanker. . .
. . .without Profess or's help .
S ir, he wi l l o n ly speak
to me and nobody else!
Reeth, th is case is
no lo nger with us .
I am try i ng to save
a ch i ld's l ife. . .
. . .and y ou are trapped i n y our
stup id bureaucratic no nsense.
If anyth i ng happens to that ch i ld,
y ou wi l l be respo ns ib le for it.
What is al l th is, Reeth?
Are y ou a s cho o l
or a co l lege student. . .
. . .that y ou entered y our
Pri ncipal's ro om and said . . .

F o o l ! I had to face such a lot
of hum i l iatio n because of y ou !
I was not wro ng, S ir.
They s hou ld be s orry, not me.
They, who do n't accept the truth
for their selfis h i nterests .
And y ou are supporti ng them !
I am o n y our s ide, not their's !
S ir, my grandma had to ld me
s ometh i ng i n ch i ld ho od .
' Reeth, ch i ld, peop le wi l l try
to stop y ou i n y our path of ho nesty'.
'They wi l l try to s care y ou .
They'l l b lock y our path'.
' But do n't be s cared, ch i ld'!
' Do n't get s cared and
stop o n y our path'!
' But go ahead with
doub le the zest'!
' Remember, however much
falseho od tries . . .
. . .o n ly the truth succeeds'!
I have decided, S ir.
I wi l l save that ch i ld .
With support or without.
What happened, ch i ld?
Are y ou sti l l afraid of me?
D id I h it y ou? N o, is n't it?
D id I s co ld y ou? N o, is n't it?
I tied y our hands s o that
y ou wo n't be ab le to ru n .
So n, human bei ngs have th is hab it.
They have been do i ng
th is s i nce time immemorial .
They ru n away from God
i nstead of go i ng to H im .
Do n't cry, ch i ld . Is y our
mother greater that Goddess Kal i?
I wi l l send y ou to Goddess Kal i,
but have y our fo od first.
Go od ch i ldren do n't cry.
If y ou cry the Goddess wi l l s co ld me.
If s he s co lds me, . . .
I'l l make h im u nderstand, mother.
Let me make h im u nderstand .
Lo ok, y ou cried and the
Goddess s co lded me.
Stop cry i ng or the goddess

I want to go to my mother!
Does y our mother lo ve y ou?
U ncle wi l l als o lo ve y ou .
Stop cry i ng .

What have y ou got to do with Reeth?
The m i n ister has h imself

Where is Reeth?
I am the i ncharge of th is case,

Wh ich means, y ou used

What's al l th is, Pawar?
S ir, let me hand le it.
I d id n't come here to

I have come here to strike
a deal with y ou .
. . .with h is no nsense!
He does n't u nderstand
that I am try i ng to help h im .
You have come here to seek my
help and not to help me.
You have come to beg

The street beggar who puts h is

. . . is much better than y ou .
M i nd y our to ngue!
Profess or, y ou are educated,

He is h imself a s lave.
He does n't even have the freedom
to meet a crim i nal l ike me. . .
. . .open ly, to save
h is ch i ld's l ife.
He has come here sav i ng h imself
from the gaze of the press . . .
. . . i n the dead of n ig ht.
Your M i n ister cares for h is
chair more than h is ch i ld .
D id y ou bri ng me here to

My s o n's l ife is i n danger,
I do n't have time and . . .
. . .and he goes o n and o n

Profess or, keep y our l im its .

It wi l l be sent to y our office,
