When I wake in the morning,
when I go to sleep at
night, I think of you.
You're like the air
which surrounds me,
the sky which spreads above me,
earth beneath my feet.
When I hear music,
when I see beauty,
when I breathe in the sunlight,
I think of you.
You are all the
women in my life.
You are the sister I never had,
the mother I have
almost forgotten.
The wife I have
always dreamed of.
There isn't a
relationship you can name
which exists between
a man and a woman
of which I wouldn't
say let it be you.
Oh let it be you.
Okay that's
the second act curtain.
I like that tempo, Lester.
Keep it that way,
stick a pin in it.
Let's take a 10-minute break.
Listen to this.
"The rumor along
Schubert Alley is
"that Myra Hudson, a
San Francisco heiress
"who needs another hit
"the way Rockefeller
needs another million,
"is rumored to have her best
play yet in Halfway to Heaven,
"which Scott Martindair put
into rehearsal this week."
I wish they'd forget
the heiress business.
Just give
your money to me, dear,
and they'll stop bothering you.
You want to talk about those
second act changes now?
I think we ought to talk
about this actor first.
He's a real find, isn't he?
And what a lovely
speaking voice.
He sounds romantic enough,
just doesn't look romantic.
He's an
excellent actor, Myra.
I know, Bill, but that
isn't enough for this role.
We've got to
convince the audience
that this character could
recite Three Blind Mice to Laura
and she would think it was
the most romantic
poem in the world.
He has to be the
kind of charm boy
that makes every woman in
the audience sit right up
and go, "Mm!"
the instant he
walks on that stage.
I haven't seen an actor
like that since John Benoir.
Scott, I've watched him
from every section
of this theater,
and I'm sorry, but he's
just not right for the part.
Have you decided to set
yourself up as a judge
as to who is
romantic-looking, Myra?
I have to direct this play.
In my opinion, he'd
be great for the part.
You're both entitled
to your opinions,
but I still say that
he's not my idea
of a romantic leading man.
Sweetie, I'm only putting a
paltry $85,000 in this play.
I know that's only the
interest on your securities,
but it happens to be my money.
That you made on my play.
Well, there's
no use in arguing.
I hate to break
the news to Blaine.
Well tell him the truth.
Make me the heavy.
Say I exercised the dramatist's
privilege of cast approval.
You heard her,
Bill, you fire him.
And they wonder why I haven't
a friend along Broadway.
That's all for today, everybody.
Oh Mr. Blaine, can
I see you a moment?
Anne.
Anything in the morning mail
that needs an immediate answer?
Telegram from San
Francisco from Steve Kearney,
and Charles Hought phoned
about an interview.
And the Dramatists Guild asked
if you can attend a committee
meeting Saturday evening.
Friday at 2:00 for Mr. Hought.
Tell the guild I'm in
rehearsal but I'll try.
Wire Steve that the
play opens on the 21 st
and I'll take the
train to San Francisco
on the following Monday.
Miss Hudson.
Miss Hudson.
Miss Hudson!
In your own native
city of San Francisco,
there's an art gallery
in the legion of Vonern,
which there's an oil
painting of Casanova.
It's quite obvious that you've
never seen this painting.
For your information,
Miss Hudson,
this is what
Casanova looked like.
He had big ears, a
scar over one eye,
a broken nose, and
a wart on his chin.
Right here.
I suggest, Miss Hudson,
that when you return
to San Francisco,
you visit this gallery
and see this painting.
Mr. Blaine.
Mr. Blaine!
Does this train go
right to San Francisco?
It's a through car.
I'll be waiting for you
at the open pier, Myra.
Thank you, Anne.
I'm so tired I don't want
to see or talk to anyone
'til I get to San Francisco.
I'll take a rest
here on the train.
I'll drive Anne to
the airport tonight.
Thanks, Bill.
I'm like Myra.
I'd rather ride the train.
Have a wonderful trip, Myra.
And if you have any spare time
between here and Chicago,
write me another play.
Oh sure, sure, I'll
have it done by Cleveland.
- Goodbye!
- Bye.
Aboard.
Aboard.
Mr. Blaine.
Oh Mr. Blaine.
Oh.
Hello, Miss Hudson.
It's
quite a coincidence
you're getting on
the train at Buffalo.
Oh I got on the train
in New York, Miss Hudson.
As a matter of fact,
I saw you embark.
You did?
I saw the whole procession.
Candy, books, flowers.
Oh, now look...
I thought perhaps you'd come
down to say goodbye to me.
And then I remembered you'd
done that about a month ago.
I tried to reach you several
times about a month ago.
Oh did you?
- Yes, I...
- Excuse me, sir.
Sorry.
Now that you're here,
won't you come in for a drink?
All right.
Shall I ring for the porter?
Yes, please.
Sit down.
What are you reading?
Time Out For Crime.
Yes, Miss Hudson?
Couple of drinks,
scotch over ice, please.
Yes, sir.
How did you know?
What you drink?
Mm-hmm.
I read the papers.
Well now that I've
finally caught up with you,
I'd like to really explain
what really happened.
Please don't.
Look Miss Hudson, you
wrote an excellent play
and cast it according
to your best judgment.
I read the reviews.
They were sensational.
My congratulations.
It's a little
embarrassing coming from you.
Forget it.
Look, let's get down to
something far more important.
Do you play stud poker?
I haven't for years.
You mean two-handed stud poker?
Yeah.
I used to play like
that with my father.
Oh, we used to fight like mad.
Liked your father?
I adored him.
He was a great poker player.
He was still willing
to take a chance.
I'll risk it.
All right, come in.
Scotch over ice?
Oh, would you get us a
deck of playing cards please?
Yes sir, I always
carry a deck on me,
in case a gentleman
needs some in a hurry.
Well, thank you.
Oh no you don't.
Oh please, I invited you.
I should say not.
But I insist.
I'll tell you what.
Let's play the match game.
The what game?
The match game,
don't you know it?
I'm afraid I
never heard of it.
All right, I'll
teach it to you.
Excuse me.
Do you have any book matches?
Yes, right here.
Thank you.
Now this is how the game goes.
Here are three matches for you.
Let me have your hand.
Three for you and three for me.
Now put both of your hands
behind your back like this.
Yes.
Now put any number of matches,
zero, one, two, or
three in one hand,
close it into a fist,
and swing it out in
front of you like this.
Now you guess how
many matches there are
in both our hands combined.
In both?
Yes.
Let's see.
Come on.
Four.
Now it's my turn to
guess, and I say three.
Now turn your hand
over like this.
Four, I won.
Yeah.
Are you sure you haven't
played this game before?
No, I'm positive.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Would you like me
close the door?
No, thank you.
Yes, sir.
And now for a
fast game of poker.
We'll need some chips.
You shuffle the cards.
We'll use the matches for chips.
There's four for you,
for me.
For you.
And for me.
Don't you have
one match too many?
Sorry.
Miss Hudson.
I'm entitled to a cut.
Sorry.
Cut.
And where were you born?
Near Pittsburgh.
My father was a coal miner.
I served a stretch
underground too as a kid.
I had to.
Since then I've traveled through
Pennsylvania only at night.
I don't recognize the
country in the daylight.
My pop couldn't understand my
wanting to breathe fresh air,
wear a clean face, read
a book now and then.
When did you start to act?
In the Army.
Playing Lenny in Mice and
Men in a camp show.
Wonderful way to fight a war,
but it was my downfall too.
Once you've lost your
heart to the theater,
it's hard to get it back.
Besides, I won't take it back.
I'm stubborn.
I like people who
make up their minds
and then stick to it,
whatever the odds.
You're a very good actor too.
It wasn't my lack of
faith in your ability
as an actor that made...
Please, it's been such
a delightful breakfast,
Miss Hudson, let's
keep it that way.
Shall we play the match game?
Certainly not.
We'll be in Chicago soon.
I'm gonna show you
a part of Chicago
you never dreamed existed.
Sports, the theater, the Roman
arena all rolled into one.
Can we see all of
that in four hours?
We can see it five minutes
where I'm gonna take you.
Let's go.
Okay.
Miss Hudson, you'll want to
put your Chicago lipstick on.
I'll wait for you
in the lounge car.
Fine, I'll meet you
there in 10 minutes.
Right.
Conductor.
How can I make arrangements
to stay on this train straight
through to San Francisco?
My ticket's only
good to Chicago.
When we pull into the station,
I'll check to see if
there's space available
on the next Pullman.
It connects with the
California Zephyr.
I'd appreciate that.
Yes sir.
I always feel that
I'm halfway home
when the train leaves Chicago.
Must give you a warm feeling
to have a home to go to.
It was such fun
in Chicago today.
An acting school for
wrestlers.
Now I've seen everything.
It's all part of the theater.
That's why I knew
you'd be interested.
You work pretty hard at
the theater, don't you?
Yes, I believe I do.
Why do you work?
Why do I work?
Well I suppose it's
a desire to achieve,
to earn my keep,
to stand on my own two feet
instead of my father's fortune,
and to make my own
place in the world.
Does that make sense to you?
Makes a lot of sense.
Personal achievement,
it's what we all want,
each in our own way.
Though to be honest, if I'd
inherited all that money
I'm not sure I'd have
had the character.
Of course you would.
Look, a lot of little cells
and glands and
molecules get together,
they spell out Lester Blaine.
There's no other person
in the whole world
who exactly duplicates you.
2, 174,000,000 people,
but only one Lester Blaine.
I'll travel part of the
way with you on that idea.
2, 174,000,000
people in the world,
and only one Myra Hudson.
Excuse me,
your table for two in the
dining car is ready, Mr. Blaine.
Thank you.
Shall we?
Myra.
"The skies are painted
with a thousand sparks.
"They're all fire, and
every one doth shine.
"But there's but one in
all doth hold his place."
Julius Ceaser,
third act, scene two.
Roger.
I bet here's one
you don't know.
"Burn this night with torches.
"I know my hearts I hope
we'll have tomorrow."
Antony.
Right.
And tomorrow you'll
be in San Francisco.
Oh you'll love
my San Francisco.
Is that a wedding ring?
It was my mother's.
Oh there she is, Steve.
She looks wonderful.
Who's that with her?
Why, it's that actor.
- Oh.
- Steve.
Myra, Myra, darling.
Welcome home.
- Good to see you.
- Darling, you look wonderful.
You remember Lester.
Oh hello, Lester.
Hello, Anne.
And this is Steve Kearney,
my lawyer, my guide,
and my dearest friend.
Mr. Kearney.
Mr. Blaine.
You ever been to San
Francisco before?
Oh very briefly I came
through with a camp show
during the war.
Oh it's going to be such
fun showing you San Francisco.
How about dining
and dancing tonight?
Tonight?
Well aren't you tired
from your trip, Myra?
Oh not at all.
Where should we pick you up?
I'm not sure where
I'm gonna stay.
Well let's say the
Fairmont at 9:00, huh?
That'll be fine.
They dance well
together, don't they?
Welcome to my home, Lester.
Thank you.
It's quite a cozy home.
Cozy enough for you
to take your coat off.
Delighted.
It's 5:00 already,
and I'm not the
least bit sleepy.
Is it that late?
It has been fun
tonight, hasn't it?
It's still
fun this morning.
This is where I work.
Where your plays are born.
Plays are born out
of everything you've ever seen
and all the men and
women you've ever known.
This is where I
put them on paper.
Would you like a drink?
Yes.
Scotch, orange juice, milk?
Whatever you're drinking.
Milk then.
What's this?
A guided missile?
No, that's my
dictating machine.
I've never
seen one like it before.
I had it built specially.
I like to wander
around when I dictate.
I'll show you something.
See this?
It's a microphone.
There are four other
hidden around the room.
There's the master
switch over there.
I turn it on,
all the microphones are
alive automatically.
When I start to talk,
the disk records.
When I stop, it stops.
That's very ingenious.
Skol.
Why don't you try it yourself?
Walk around the room.
Say something.
Well...
When I wake in the morning,
when I go to sleep at
night, I think of you.
You're like the air
which surrounds me,
the sky which spreads above me,
the earth beneath my feet.
When I hear music,
when I see beauty,
when I breathe in the sunlight,
I think of you.
You are the sister I never had,
the mother I have
almost forgotten,
the wife I have
always dreamed of.
They're isn't a
relationship you can name
which exists between
a man and a woman
in which I wouldn't
say let it be you.
Let it be you.
It's very flattering
to be quoted.
I'll play it back for you.
Say something.
Well...
When I wake in the morning,
when I go to sleep at
night, I think of you.
You're like the air
which surrounds me.
The sky which spreads above me,
the earth beneath my feet.
When I hear music,
when I see beauty,
when I breathe in the sunlight,
I think of you.
You are the sister I never had,
the mother I have
almost forgotten,
the wife I have
always dreamed of.
There isn't a
relationship you can name
which exists between
a man and a woman
in which I wouldn't
say let it be you.
Let it be you.
It's very flattering to be quoted.
It was a wonderful day.
Every minute of it.
Dinner's at 7:00.
Don't be late, darling.
I'll be ahead of time.
Operator.
Operator, I've been
trying to get Prospect 17171
for two hours.
Will you please
check and make sure
the phone isn't out of order?
One moment, please.
Thank you.
Myra, we're a
delegation of two
to see what's happened
to our hostess.
Myra, you must
come downstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.
You've been trying
to teach me manners
ever since I was a kid.
Everybody's waiting.
Shh!
On your call to Prospect 17171,
there is no answer.
Something must
have happened to him.
Maybe the guy got
his dates mixed.
You know sometimes...
He knew I was giving
this party just for him.
Myra, let me phone, so
you can join your guests.
Maybe he misunderstood the time.
Oh he'd have called.
He calls every night.
He wouldn't be two
hours late though
unless something had happened.
I must go to him.
Could I drive you, Myra?
No thanks, Junior.
This is something I have
to do all by myself.
What will
I tell the guests?
It doesn't matter.
Tell them anything.
Just tell them anything.
Lester.
Where have you been?
I've been calling and calling.
Why haven't you answered?
Forgive me.
Where are you going?
I have no place
in your life, Myra.
No proper place.
And you are leaving
without even a word?
I don't
belong to your world.
You have so much.
I have nothing.
Without you, I have nothing.
Oh Lester.
Darling.
Good morning.
Good morning.
How did you sleep last night?
Wonderfully.
Come on sleepyhead,
let's get out of bed.
No don't, now don't
do that to me!
Where's your bathing suit?
Over there in the drawer.
Which one is it?
That one.
Here come on, let's take
a swim before breakfast.
All right.
Turn your head away.
Go on, turn your head away.
I like to look at you.
You couldn't possibly
at this hour in the morning.
Oh anybody can look
at you in the afternoon.
But I haven't
even got my lipstick on.
A woman has to wear lipstick.
I feel positively
naked without it.
Darling.
Let's get out of here
before I forget
I'm a married man.
Do you want this, dear?
Yes please.
I'll fix breakfast
for us after our swim.
Where are the
steps to the float?
Right here.
Follow me.
Okay.
Whoa!
What's the
matter, darling?
It's a precipice.
I've been running
up and down these steps
ever since I was 12.
Don't you
ever do it again.
Why not?
Remember what Nietzsche
said, "Live dangerously."
You know what
happened to Nietzsche?
What?
He's dead.
Mr. and Mrs. Lester Blaine
will proceed down this ski
jump at a nice slow walk.
All right.
Watch out.
What is it?
There isn't even a guardrail.
But there's
no danger, not really.
Oh no?
Could get killed falling
down these steps.
What a
beautiful place for it.
You know what we do
here in the wintertime?
No.
We ski.
Mrs Blaine,
you're about to be dunked!
Oh no no no no!
Yes you are!
Eve, darling.
Myra, oh so nice.
My dearest friends,
Eve and George Ralstin.
- Good evening.
- Hello, Lester.
Lester.
George.
And Dr. Van Roan.
How do you do, Doctor?
Looks like you married a
good healthy specimen, Myra.
Oh darling, I'm
so happy for you.
I hope you play bridge.
Very badly.
Fine, that's what
we're looking for,
a bad bridge player
with good money.
George.
Just a joke, dear.
Good evening, Mr. Kearney.
Julius.
How have
you been, Myra?
Fine.
We had a divine time
at the summer house.
Oh Myra,
did my mother come yet?
Yes, she's
with Tom and Francesca.
Oh I see her.
Come on darling,
say hello to mother.
Yes, George.
Excuse me, please.
Yes, Doctor.
Sure, Doctor.
Myra.
Hello, Junior.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
This is Irene
Neves from New York.
Myra Hudson.
No.
It's Blaine now, isn't it?
Yes it is.
How do you do, Miss Neves?
How do you do, Mrs. Blaine?
This is my husband,
Lester Blaine.
How do
you do, Mr. Blaine?
Miss Neves.
Welcome to
California, Miss Neves.
Thank you.
Are you a visitor or are
you going to stay here?
Oh no, I intend to
become a San Franciscan.
I've taken an apartment
at the Tamil Pies.
How nice.
You'll excuse
us, Myra, Lester.
Junior.
Introduce Miss
Neves to our guests
and give her a drink, will you?
Sure.
It's very nice to
have met you both.
Hello, Steve.
Hello, Junior.
This is Irene Neves.
My brother Steve.
How do you do, Miss Neves?
How about you and I
having a drink together?
Don't get out, it's too late.
Thank you for a lovely evening.
I usually take
my girls to the front door
and kiss them goodnight.
You stay right where you are.
Good night, dear.
Call me tomorrow.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night, Junior.
Come on.
What are you doing
in San Francisco?
An old friend of mine
married a San Francisco girl.
Here.
I'll show you.
It was in all the
New York papers.
Good picture of both
of them, isn't it?
Don't be cute.
I thought I'd come out here
to see how you
were getting along.
How long have you been here?
A week, and take
your hands off me!
Where did you meet Kearney?
At his office.
You see, I thought I
might need a lawyer.
Your wife's lawyer from choice.
Steve's my wife's lawyer.
Yes.
But Junior is more
impressionable.
What have you
said to impress him?
He said you were going
to Chicago for a job.
What have you
said to impress him?
You mean have I told him
why a certain woman
lent you 5,000?
Have you?
Have you?
Not yet.
And I haven't told
him about the house
on Fire Island either,
or the night after New Years.
If you ever do, you're
gonna need a new face.
Remember that.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks for what?
For still loving me.
Tell Mr. Builder
I'll call back,
and please hold the phone
calls for a while, Miss Carter.
Yes, Mr. Kearney.
Now as I understand it,
this all boils down to a
matter of dollars and cents.
That's right.
You realize of course
that your wife is a
very wealthy woman.
I've never
discussed it with her.
I see.
Before I pursue
the matter further,
I think I should know just
how much money you require?
Naturally I can't
pretend to support Myra,
but I ought to at
least support myself.
Certainly I had no
intention of implying that...
I'm sure of it.
You're too good a
friend of Myra's,
and I hope eventually mine.
Excuse me, Lester.
Sure.
Yes?
Steve, I've just
added up Myra's new figure
for the Hudson Foundation.
Do you realize what
percentage of the estate
she's giving away?
I'll talk to you
about it later.
You were saying there's
very little work
for an actor here
in San Francisco.
Yes.
Still Myra comes first with me,
so since her friends and
her interests are here,
this is where
we'll have to live.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Now if you could
give me some advice
on what kind of
employment to look for.
I don't like to use
my wife's connections,
but unfortunately, I
don't have any of my own.
I see.
You realize that with Myra's
income as a playwright,
there's no real necessity
for you to work at all.
There's a very real necessity
for my going to work, Steve.
You see, I'm not
the kind of a man
who could live on
his wife's money.
I understand.
Say, Steve, before I
prepare the conveyance
for the husband to sign...
Here's a friend of yours.
Oh hello, Lester.
Hello, Junior.
Good to see you.
Thank you.
Social visit,
or is Kearney and Kearney
about to get a new client?
- Purely social.
- Yes, he's right here.
Telephone for you.
A Miss Irene Neves.
Oh.
Junior.
Pardon me, Lester.
Sure.
Hello, Irene.
Drink?
You did?
Yes.
I had a wonderful time too.
How about trying it
again sometime soon?
Tonight?
Oh don't worry,
you couldn't get rid
of me if you tried.
What a charming place
you chose for a rendezvous.
You're still running
after young Kearney.
What's the idea?
You're hurting me.
I haven't started to hurt you
unless you give me
some straight answers.
Why are you seeing Kearney?
Because you haven't
called me in eight days,
because the rent's due,
and because I'd rather
eat dinner than starve.
I'll get you some
money as soon as I can.
I've gotta watch my step.
What am I supposed to
do while you watch it?
Look at the walls and wait
for the phone to ring?
I'll tell you what you can do.
You can help me.
Junior likes you.
He'd talk easy for
somebody he liked.
What do you want
him to talk about?
My wife is giving
a lot of money away
to a thing called the
Hudson Heart Foundation.
I want to know who gets how much
and who handles the money.
Why don't you turn
over in bed some morning
and ask her?
Why don't we really
start to work together
the way we used to?
Yes.
Why don't we?
Can you see what you
can get out of Kearney?
I'll turn him inside out.
Hello?
Lester.
It's about time you called.
Yeah yeah, I finally
got him to talk.
It took five martinis.
He really talked last night.
You want to know what part
of her father's estate
she's giving away?
All of it.
I wish I was kidding,
but according to Junior,
she's only keeping
a little real estate
that she bought
with her own money
and the royalties from a play.
All the rest she's giving
to the Hm Hm Foundation.
Well that's a fine noble
character you married.
Ha.
Why don't you use that key
I gave you and come on over.
We've got lots to talk about.
Yeah.
Goodbye.
Hi.
Hello, darling.
Thanks again for a
wonderful time last night.
Dancing in the
middle of the week
made me feel like a debutante.
You look like a debutante.
What have you got there?
Just a little private party
before the guests arrive.
You know you're spoiling me,
for any other husband.
I can't think of
anything more exciting
than drinking champagne in
a pretty woman's bedroom.
I can't think of
anything more exciting
than drinking
champagne with you.
Skol.
I was talking to
Steve the other day.
He'll be here
in a few minutes.
Said he was coming early
to bring some papers.
He mentioned something
about a trust fund
you were setting up in
memory of your father?
Mm-hmm,
Heart Foundation.
Great idea.
Tell me about it
someday, will you?
I'd love to, darling.
You're mussing me.
Am I?
Who is it?
Mr. Kearney has
arrived to see Mrs. Blaine.
Hello, Steve.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Myra dear,
happy birthday.
But that isn't until Monday.
Oh, but this coming
Monday is the big birthday,
as you know,
the day you sign the trust
agreement over to the foundation.
Oh don't tell me I have
still more papers to look at.
A simultaneous conveyance
for Lester to put his name on.
You're married now.
I know it.
And I love it.
And while I was about it,
I made out a new will for
you to sign, because...
Because I'm
married now, I know.
As your friend, as
well as your attorney,
I took the liberty of suggesting
what I consider a
sensible bequest.
Thank you, Steve.
If the terms
don't satisfy you,
I can change them to
anything you like.
My husband, on my death,
income 10,000 a year for life,
or until he remarries.
Steve.
I wouldn't do a thing like
that to someone I loved.
Not for all the
money in the world.
I'm not going to hang on
to any man from the grave.
I'm astonished at you.
Steve, all my life
I've been rich.
Nobody could give me anything.
I had it all.
But that wasn't enough.
Then I met Lester.
He filled my life completely.
He gave me everything.
And took nothing.
Only my love.
And for the first time
in my life, I felt poor,
because that was
all I had to give.
And for the first time
in my life, I felt rich,
because he gave me
so much in return.
Myra.
You'd lambaste the daylights
out of any playwright
who turned out
dialogue like that.
I know.
But the happy heart
loves the cliche.
Yes, I know.
Look, let me dictate the changes
I'd like in this tomorrow
and you can pick it up
with the rest of the papers
on Monday, huh?
Could you do it now?
Junior and I are going
to Sacramento tomorrow.
Oh that sounds very gay.
Doesn't it?
We're arguing a case before
the State Supreme Court.
Well.
I guess I better
think about it now.
To my dear husband.
To my beloved husband.
What's the matter, Steve?
Nothing, nothing at all.
I'd better dictate
these changes.
Paragraph one.
I do hereby give and bequeath
to my beloved husband,
Lester Blaine,
the income from all
my play royalties,
this income to be
his in perpetuity,
and is not revocable on his
remarriage after my death,
or during my lifetime, should
our marriage be dissolved.
I'm not going to hang on to him
from this side of
the grave either.
Oh my guests are here.
Steve, be an angel and
run down and tell them
I'll be there in 10
minutes, will you?
Certainly.
Thanks.
Paragraph two.
Would you
like the doors closed?
Yes, please.
Paragraph two.
Upon my death, all my real
estate and investment holdings
are to go to my husband,
as a small return for the
happiness he has given me.
It was so nice of Mrs.
Blaine to ask me here tonight.
I have to see you alone.
I don't see how.
It's a pleasure to have
you here, Miss Neves.
It's very important.
Myra will be
right down, Lester.
Thank you, Steve.
All right, Myra's
study upstairs,
I'll tell you when.
Thank you.
Junior.
Yes, Irene?
Good evening, Anne.
I'll bid four spades.
Pass.
Six hearts.
I'll just
double six hearts.
Re-double.
Oh no.
Now we're in for it.
Let's take a look
at that dummy partner.
Good morning, Anne.
Good morning, Myra.
You slept late after
the party last night.
Yes, Lester had already
gone by the time I woke up.
He left
a message for you,
said he might be
late for dinner.
Oh?
Did you know
you left the dictating
machine on last night?
Oh no I didn't,
I turned it off.
At least I think I did.
Well it was on
when I was ready to leave,
so I turned it off.
Maybe I did leave it on.
I was feeling very
gay last night.
It's good
to see you so happy.
Paragraph one.
I do hereby give and bequeath
to my beloved husband,
Lester Blaine,
the income from all
my play royalties,
this income to be
his in perpetuity,
and is not revocable on his
remarriage after my death,
or during my lifetime, should
our marriage be dissolved.
I'm not going to hang on to him
from this side of
the grave either.
Oh, my guests are here.
Steve, be an angel and
run down and tell them
I'll be there in 10
minutes, will you?
Certainly.
Thanks.
Paragraph two.
Would you like the doors closed?
Yes, please.
Paragraph two.
Upon my death, all my real
estate and investment holdings
are to go to my husband,
as a small return for the
happiness he has given me.
What's up?
Listen, Junior's told me something
I think you ought to know.
She's made a new will.
Go on.
That's what Steve
had to see her about.
He's leaving with Junior for
Sacramento for three days.
When they return on Monday,
the will is to be signed.
Why the rush?
I don't know.
How do I stand in it?
I couldn't find out.
If Steve rigged it,
I'll be out flat on my face.
Why couldn't you find out?
What excuse can I give Junior
for asking?
I take enough
chances as it is.
This part of the 
loving bridegroom
is beginning to
crawl out of my ears.
You know the lines.
Just keep on saying
them and you do it good.
Sometimes when I'm with her,
it's all I can keep from saying,
"Be yourself, wise up.
"Love you?
"I never loved you,
never for one moment."
I'd like to see her face.
You're talking crazy.
Come here.
Take is easy.
I've gotta go back downstairs.
Just once more.
You've smeared my lipstick.
I've gotta fix it
before somebody comes.
Where's a mirror?
Here by the desk.
Just to hold you like this,
that's all I dream about.
Lester, don't.
I don't know how I stand it
not being with you.
What's this on the desk?
It's the will.
"Last will and testament
of Myra Hudson Blaine."
Let's see where I come in.
JV Hudson Foundation.
Oh, that's not it.
Here it is.
To my husband, Lester
Blaine, on my death,
$10,000 a year.
Is that all?
Get a load of this,
"Until he remarries."
And you thought
you were playing it so smart,
not taking anything from her,
no presents, no jewelry,
no handouts, no nothing!
If that dirty
double-crossing dame
thinks that she can...
Listen, she can't 
sign it 'til Monday.
Did Junior say that?
Yes, she comes into the rest
of her old man's money Monday.
She can't dispose of
it 'til it's hers.
She doesn't sign the will
until Monday,
so what's the difference?
Suppose she isn't able
to sign it on Monday.
What do you mean?
Suppose something happened to her
between now and Monday.
Who'd get her money?
Her husband.
Lester Blaine.
I'd get it all, why not?
Sure, why not?
Rich.
You and me, rich.
Lester, I have a gun.
Gun is no good.
It'll have to look
like an accident.
Sure, sure, but that's easy.
Not too easy.
We've got three days.
I've gotta be smart.
As her husband, I'd be
suspected before she was cold.
Three days.
We'll work it out.
Kiss me.
Hard.
Crazy about you.
I could break your bones.
No more.
We'll have to be careful.
You'd better give
me the key back.
What key?
You know what key.
The key to my apartment.
Uh-uh, I might need it.
Don't you dare,
with Junior popping in and out,
and your wife's house
only a few blocks away.
That's a break
with Steve and
Junior being away.
I gotta think fast.
Gotta think of a nice
foolproof little accident.
We'll work something out.
I know a way.
I know...
This part of
the loving bridegroom
is beginning to
crawl out of my ears.
Just to take hold of you like
this, it's what I dream about.
Take it easy, Lester.
I don't know
how I can stand it,
not being with you.
I'm so crazy about you.
I could break your bones.
I'll make her pay for this.
But it's got to look
like an accident.
A nice foolproof
little accident.
An accident.
Accident.
Accident!
Myra?
Myra?
Myra, are you in there?
Myra, let me in!
I heard a scream.
What's the matter, darling?
What's the matter?
I was asleep.
I guess I was dreaming.
What's wrong, Myra?
Anne and the servants
haven't seen you all day.
I haven't been
feeling too well.
Oh I'm sorry.
Is it anything serious?
No, just a frightful headache.
I've never
seen you look like this.
I guess maybe I had too
much champagne last night.
Yeah.
You drank a toast
with everybody.
I'll fix you something
for your headache.
No.
I'm sorry, my nerves
are so on edge.
I've had an aspirin.
I'll be all right if I
can just sleep this off.
Just as you say, dear.
I'll put you to bed then.
Come on.
You'll feel better when
you get under the covers.
Now isn't that better?
Now I'm going to see that
you get a good night's rest.
Where are your sleeping pills?
Here they are.
This will help you to sleep.
Here.
What's the matter, darling?
I'm sure I'll fall
asleep without it.
I'm very tired.
All right.
Don't fight it, dear.
Take the pill if
you can't sleep.
Good night, darling.
Oh I'm going to bed
early tonight too,
so would you like me
to leave my door open
in case you need me?
No thanks.
You better
give me the key back.
What key?
You know what key,
the key to my apartment.
Uh-uh,
I might need it.
Lester.
I have a gun.
Good morning, Mr. Blaine.
Good morning, Mrs. Blaine.
You're up early.
Didn't you sleep?
Like a top.
The last thing I remember
was reaching for the pill,
and I was fast asleep.
You're
feeling much better.
Much.
Service.
I'm feeling a little
apologetic this morning.
What about?
Yesterday, I'm afraid I
was pretty bad tempered.
You weren't much
like yourself.
I've just been
working too hard lately,
trying to get my
new play started.
I'm sorry, Lester.
I think it might be a good idea
to get away for a
few days, rest up.
Maybe I could bring that
nice-tempered Mrs. Blaine back.
Go away?
Where will you go?
Oh just down to
the summer house.
This time of year?
I know it sounds crazy,
but I love it down by
the bay in the winter.
It's so quiet,
I can take walks
along the waterfront.
Sounds pretty dreary.
It's wonderful.
It's like being on
a desert island.
Aren't any of the houses open?
Nothing near.
All the houses along the
waterfront are closed
for the season.
I'll only have
seagulls for company.
Like a Russian novel.
It's very restful being alone.
Away from everybody.
You don't mind my tidying
up after you, do you?
I don't mind
anything about you,
except your going away.
Okay.
If that's what you want,
that's what we'll do.
Oh but I wouldn't
expect you to come.
Of course I'll come.
No really, there's
no reason for you to be bored
just because I need a rest.
Now get this straight darling.
I wouldn't let you go
down there by yourself.
Let's not argue about it.
I'll confess something.
I was hoping you
would ask to come.
Then it's all settled.
If you're
sure you don't mind.
Mind when it's for you?
We'll have a second honeymoon.
No servants, no visitors,
just the two of us.
Sounds wonderful.
It'll be wonderful.
I'll start to pack right away.
Wait.
It's too soon to pack, isn't it,
since we're not
leaving until Sunday.
Sunday?
But I thought...
I would if I could,
but I can't get away
any earlier, dear.
Oh Lester, would
you do me a favor?
Of course, dear.
Would you drive down and air
out the house this afternoon
and build a fire to get
rid of the dampness?
I'll be glad to.
Good, I'll see
you at dinner then.
Wait a minute.
Aren't you going to kiss me?
Why do you look at me like that?
I was just wondering what
I'd done to deserve you.
Did you know
that Myra asked me
to lunch with her today?
What
did you tell her?
That I had a date
with a very exciting man.
You don't suppose she could
suspect anything, do you?
Not the way
I make love to her.
Sunday's cutting
it awfully thin, isn't it?
Sure.
This place is so
perfect for an accident.
Down those stairs.
It was her own
idea to come here.
Yes, now look,
the first thing you
do tomorrow morning
is to call up the
theater ticket agency,
get two seats for a
couple of shows next week.
Who for?
We can't...
For her.
You better make it four seats,
and ask Junior and me.
I'll get Junior to
plan dinner first
or a supper party afterwards.
And then we'll all be
brokenhearted together.
Good morning.
Ready?
Ready.
For what?
To go to the summer
house the way you planned.
You're not dressed yet.
But I told you.
Oh I am sorry.
It must have been Anne I told.
Told what?
About the Ralstins.
You see, yesterday
was her birthday,
and tomorrow is mine,
and every year she gives
this birthday party
the day in between.
I'd completely
forgotten about it.
What are you saying?
That we're not going
to the summer house.
We're going to the
Ralstins' instead.
But you promised.
I know.
But if I promised Eve
first a long time ago.
Listen, you said we were
going to the summer house.
You can't back out now.
Lester, why are
you so excited?
I guess I was
just disappointed.
I've been looking forward
to being alone with you,
another honeymoon.
We can still
have it, next week.
But you need a rest now.
Why give it up for
a dinner party?
I'm feeling much better now,
and besides, Steve and Junior
will be back from Sacramento.
I thought they weren't
due until Monday.
At the office.
They'll be home tonight.
She's asked them too.
Dinner and bridge.
Dinner and bridge.
You might have told me sooner.
Is it so important?
No.
I broke a golf date
this afternoon.
But you could still go out.
It's early.
Don't be cross.
I'm not cross.
It's sweet of you
to be disappointed.
I'll go to the club
and see if I can get a game.
Oh, don't be late.
I've asked Steve, Irene,
and Junior for cocktails
so we can all go on
to Eve's together.
All right.
And you let
her get away with it.
You let her get away with it.
Will you cut it out?
I couldn't make her go, could I?
I couldn't carry her there.
You may have to.
There are only a few hours left.
This is our last
chance, our last chance!
I could have strangled her
when she said we weren't going.
Two whole days
thrown away, lost,
could've planned something,
could've worked it all out!
All right, we can't
waste any more time.
All right, answer it.
Hello?
Okay.
It's the land lady.
The radio's too loud.
Lester, it's got to be tonight.
We can't take any
chances and lose everything.
It's got
to be an accident.
A quick accident.
What kind of an accident?
What kind, what kind?
Keep your voice down.
What kind of an accident?
Lester.
Yeah?
Do you remember that woman
who tried to kill
herself on Fire Island?
So?
I took it away from her.
Remember?
What?
What she tried
to kill herself with.
But what good does that do us?
I've got it, I saved it.
I'll show you.
Refills, everybody?
Yes, sir.
Always rum for one more.
Oh, Junior, please.
Irene, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were
going to wear white tonight.
If it's going to be
embarrassing for you,
I can run upstairs and
change in a second.
Oh no, you look
so lovely, Myra.
Thank you.
My, this is a
wonderful martini.
Thank you.
The servants are off tonight.
Excuse me while I get
the hoers de'vours.
Why don't we
just stay here tonight?
This is more fun
than playing bridge.
Bridge is
a wonderful game.
Occupies the mind,
keeps you away from bad company,
and yields a small
but steady income.
Well if I must play bridge,
I hope Myra's my partner.
Okay, partner?
Myra's mind is
someplace else tonight.
Come to the party, dear.
Oh I'm so sorry.
I hate
to break this up,
but we're due at the Ralstins.
I'll get my coat right away.
A year ago
tonight at the Ralstins,
Junior and I made seven
spades, doubled and redoubled.
Ready, everybody?
Myra!
Myra!
Are you all right?
I think so.
Get some
water somebody.
Sure.
How did it happen?
Oh I tripped over my coat.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'm still alive.
Sit on this chair here.
Oh my ankle.
Which one is it?
Let's have a look at it.
This one.
Careful.
Let's take the shoe off.
Hey that looks pretty bad.
We'd better call a doctor.
Oh no.
No, it isn't that serious.
If it isn't better by
tomorrow, I'll have it x-rayed.
Here, drink this.
Here, darling.
Thank you.
Try to stand on it,
that's the best thing.
No I don't
think she should.
Exercise
is good for it.
Is it?
Keeps the circulation going.
All right, Irene, I'll try it.
Yeah.
Lester.
Will you help me?
Sure.
No no, it's no use.
I think you ought
to get right to bed, Myra.
Yes, perhaps you're right.
Maybe if you rested a while.
Oh no, I'm afraid not.
I don't suppose there's
any use asking you
to go on without me?
Not a husband like yours.
I certainly wouldn't
leave you alone.
You'll have to go by yourselves.
Tell Eve and George
how sorry we are.
All right.
I'll get your coat, Irene.
The faster
we get out of here,
the sooner she'll get to bed.
Sorry, Myra.
I feel such a fool
falling down the steps.
So clumsy of me.
If you insist
on being your own doctor,
remember, it's ice
packs for a sprain,
not a hot water bottle.
I know.
Thank you, Steve.
I'll take
good care of Myra.
Of course you will, Lester.
I'll just put on my scarf.
There's a mirror, excuse me.
I hope I haven't
broken up your game tonight.
Forget it, just
take care of your ankle.
I will,
thank you, Junior.
So we'll play cut in,
but I still think you
ought to call the doctor.
Please tell
Eve how sorry I am.
I know she'll understand.
She'll
understand, dear.
Of course she will.
I'll call after dinner
to see how you feel.
Yes, dear.
Good night.
I do hope you feel
better soon, Myra.
Thank you, Irene.
Please let yourselves out.
I want to take Myra upstairs.
Goodbye.
Good
night, Lester, Myra.
Let's go, dear.
I'm sorry to
spoil your evening.
But you don't like
bridge anyway.
Would you get me an ice bag?
And a cigarette, please?
I'll see if there's an
ice bag in the bathroom.
No ice bag here.
I'll have to go
downstairs for one.
Will you bring my coat?
It's still on the stairs.
Right.
Ice bag, coat, and I'll
pick up your shoe too.
Oh and maybe a book.
Would you like me to read
to you after a while?
Yes.
I'd like that.
I'd like that very much.
Let mystery have
its place in you.
Do not be always turning
up your whole soil
with the plowshare
of self-examination.
Leave a little fallow
corner in your heart
ready for any seed
the winds may bring.
And reserve a look of
shadow for the passing bird.
Keep a place in your heart
for the unexpected guest.
An altar for the unknown god.
Then if a bird sings
among your branches,
do not be too eager to tame it.
If you are conscious
of something new,
thought or feeling,
awakening in the
depths of your being,
do not be in a hurry to
let in light upon it,
to look at it.
Let the springing germ
have the protection
of being forgotten.
Hedge it around with quiet.
And do not break in
upon its darkness.
Let it take shape, and grow.
And not a word of your
happiness to anyone.
Darling.
Are you asleep?
You've
been found guilty
of murder in the first degree,
and for the killing
of Lester Blaine,
you will be sentenced to death.
No, no, no, no!
Oh!
Well hello.
Let me go.
How about buying
me a little drink?
Let me go, please!
Oh come on...
I said let me go!
Dames.
Junior, it's nice of you
to bring me home from
the party so early,
when you were having
such a good time.
Please, Junior, I
have a headache,
I'm gonna take an
aspirin and go to bed.
I've run into some stiff
competition in my time.
It's the first time I ever
tangled with an aspirin.
Junior, I told you
why I came home early.
I know what's awfully
good for a headache.
Why don't you just relax
and let yourself go?
Not tonight, Junior, please.
Don't send me away, not now.
I don't want
to, you know that.
But this headache, that's
why I left the party early.
You're much too beautiful
to have a headache.
You needn't crush me to death.
I'm sorry, it's just,
I've been driving myself
crazy imagining things.
Imagining maybe
there's someone else.
When do you give me a chance?
If there were, I'd kill him.
You wouldn't kill anyone.
Why not?
You're not the type.
There now, satisfied?
The answer is no.
But I'll go.
Just one more.
Good night, Junior.
All right, but take
care of yourself.
See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Whew.
No.
No!
Irene?
Why didn't you answer the
phone a few minutes ago?
I just wanted to say
good night again.
Irene.
Irene?
Irene, are you all right?
Answer me, Irene.
Irene.
Irene!
Irene!
Irene, where are you?
Irene?
Irene, open the door!
Irene!
Irene, where are you?
Irene!
Myra.
Myra!
Mister.
Mister, please help me.
Let me in please.
Please, please help me!
Lester!
That's Irene!
- Lester!
- Irene!
Oh no.
No!
What a smash-up.
Don't touch anything.
You gotta wait
for the ambulance.
The man's dead.
The girl's dead too.
