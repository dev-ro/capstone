Lily, go play with yourself.
I have to talk to uncle.
Quick...
Kiss me.
Suck it.
Suck it.
Damn you, slut.
Lick it.
Lick it. Suck it.
I want to squeeze you.
You like that?
Water oozing...
Sit on me. Quick.
Whore, you want me to fuck you
in daytime?
Don't you fear your husband?
He is at Casio Lisboa. Are you
afraid that he will come home?
Concentrate on your job. Two times
slowly and three times fast.
Two times slowly, three times fast.
Lily, what are you doing outside?
Mum is talking to uncle Kai.
I had to go for a walk.
Damn, is she seducing him again?
Nam, take Lily inside.
- Go on.
It's not my fault.
She wanted it herself.
I will kill you, bastard.
You fuck my wife. Rotten bastard.
Are you screwing my wife?
Eat dust, bastard.
- Stop it. Stop kicking.
I will kill you.
- He made me do it. I didn't want to.
Why only you and no others?
He wanted to teach you a lesson. He
likes to fuck the wife of his boss.
Shut up, whore.
You are dead.
Fuck my wife?
I'll teach you a lesson.
Does that bother you?
- No, he deserves it.
I don't even care if you kill him.
Nam, lift him up.
Get up.
He's fainted.
Piss on him.
Piss on him. Now.
Go away. Get up.
Get up, asshole.
Crawl, you motherfucker.
Damn you. Come here.
On you knees for me.
Kneel down, bastard.
- Don't hit me.
Kneel down.
How dare you fuck my wife?
Nam, get a pair of scissors.
How dare you?
Don't you see me as your boss?
Damn you, bastard. Come here.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I dare not look at you.
Look at me.
Put down your pants.
- I dare not.
Get your dick out. It is it's fault.
Put it out.
- But it is already so small, boss.
Don't. Don't castrate me.
Get it out.
- Don't castrate me.
Asshole. I will castrate you.
- I'll do it myself.
You will do it yourself?
- I will castrate myself...
I will castrate myself.
Cut it? Spare my dick, boss.
Don't panic. Come.
Did you betray me, dirty whore?
Put out your tongue.
Don't you talk so much.
You are a no good boss, asshole.
You want to bully me?
No...
It doesn't hurt much. Come on.
What are you doing?
I am killing them. Is that a problem?
Damn you.
Fuck off.
Why does she bully me?
She says nothing to you.
Some people are that way.
- It's crowded. Come and help.
Stupid bastard.
I find that Kai so annoying.
He is really lousy.
It's hard to find a guy like him.
He is cheap and he will do anything.
How is it going?
Put the money inside.
Come and get your pay.
- Great.
Kel, your wife bullies me all day.
You know women. Forget it.
- She is mean. How can you stand it?
We have lots of happy moments too.
I know.
- What do you know?
You have a big dick. She moans
loudly when you are in the bed.
Everyone knows this.
- That is true.
Excuse me.
Lily, let's stay a few days
and make some fun.
With you? Who would want that?
- I just want pre-honeymoon.
Who would want that with you?
- Suit yourself.
All I know is that I'm hungry.
Let's eat.
Hurry up.
What's the best price
for that steak?
Ten rand per kilo, okay?
- Fifteen.
Twelve, that's all I got.
Alright. Bill, give the guy his meat.
The usual order.
- How do I know what the usual is?
I want a whole pig.
- A pig? Five hundred.
Five hundred? I come to you always.
Give me discount. Expensive.
Five hundred. Take it or leave it.
Let's go. He is bullying us.
- Don't go.
Don't we need to work?
You're wasting my time.
Take the meat or fuck off.
What? I'll fuck you. I will fuck you
today, tomorrow and yesterday.
The yellow bastard wants a fight.
Shut up.
Okay, I'll buy the meat.
I dare say you have a soft dick,
black man.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Go in. I'll treat to a good dinner.
How many people?
- Four.
This way.
See if you find anything you like.
What can you recommend?
- This is a famous restaurant.
The frog rice is excellent.
Disgusting.
At your service.
Asshole, you let
those white bastards bully you?
And you treat me as your slave.
What are you murmuring?
Take it inside.
I don't want frog rice.
- What would you want then?
Why? It stinks.
Go through the backdoor.
Bullshit. The padlock doesn't work.
Stupid pig.
Horrible.
- Have some tea.
Are you alright?
- I have to vomit.
Lily.
Where is the washroom?
Upstairs.
- Order some food.
Watch out, will you?
You motherfucker, white bastard.
Drink this.
It will make you feel high.
This way.
Frog rice?
- She doesn't want it.
I don't feel well. I'm going.
Are you ill?
- It's nothing.
I'll take you to the hotel.
I'm sorry.
- Enjoy the food.
Damn, I hate South Africa.
I've been here for years and I'm
always fucking the same whore.
Black take me as white
and white take me as black.
The sperm is spoiling out
from my mouth.
Why? You can find whores everywhere.
Really? Where are they?
Yeah, over there. The blonde one.
I did too. You can fuck any of them.
Are you serious?
As long as you have a dick.
Take fifty dollars.
Let me grab you.
I want to grab you.
More money. Fuck you.
Beat it. I do it with whites,
no yellow skin. Fuck off.
No problem.
- Fuck off.
Disgusting. You smell like shit.
Don't you people ever wash?
Get your hands off me.
I need a fucking.
Looking for trouble? Follow me.
- No fuck you.
Get out and never come back.
Come on, Natasia.
Harder.
Quick.
Deeper.
- That's impossible.
I can go deeper.
Harder.
It's a bird.
I'm dying.
It's a pig.
No...
Superman.
I'm dying.
It is over.
Still one more push, darling.
I can't anymore.
What's wrong?
I had that dream again.
That nightmare? It's only a dream.
Maybe you have traveled
too much recently.
I haven't had that dream for years.
I thought it was over.
It's only a dream.
When we're in Hong Kong
we'll see a doctor.
Go get some sleep.
I know... The restaurant.
Which restaurant?
The one we just visited.
- You mean today?
Is the dream because of the dead pig?
No, the man who murdered my parents
was inside.
Did you see him there?
No, but I could smell the blood.
You smelled blood,
but you didn't see him.
It's because of the dead pig.
No, I remember the smell
from the past.
It makes me vomit. It's exhausting.
Don't worry.
Take a rest.
Tomorrow it'll be alright.
I ordered Steamed Pork
not Sweet sour Pork.
Sorry, sir.
He doesn't speak Chinese.
The customer's complaining.
He ordered Steamed Pork, not this.
Just a moment.
- Steam some for him.
Take this. This is a nice piece.
Fuck off.
These whites always cheat you.
I'd have killed them all if I could
ten years ago.
But the blacks also sell pork.
Who needs the white people?
These blacks are so dark...
You can never tell what they think.
- That's true.
We are not going to a tribe
of cannibals, are we?
No one would want to eat
a filthy bastard like you. You stink.
That's true.
But your skin is fair and smooth.
The blacks might catch and rape you.
Asshole. You are crazy.
Shut the fuck up.
Stop here.
There's nothing here.
- I have to take a leak.
Me too.
What was that sound? Did you fart?
No, didn't you fart yourself?
- Fuck you.
Wait, it will bite your dick.
Asshole.
Don't move.
Stay here.
It doesn't know what you are.
Don't come closer...
Stay there.
I wasn't ready yet.
I am.
What? Did you piss in my car?
Damn.
Drive away. Quickly.
Look, a beautiful black girl.
She walks as if she were
totally drunk.
Look, her nipples are big as prunes.
I don't want any problems
with those tribes here.
We have come here to buy pigs.
Yeah, I bet she's still a virgin.
You are a filthy rotten bastard.
It is too narrow. Let's go back.
We can walk the last bit.
I'll wait here.
Are you crazy? Wait?
What do you mean? Who is the boss?
You only know about whores.
Quickly, or I'll cut your dick.
- Okay, I'm coming.
It's crowded. Let's have a look.
Let's go. What is this?
- It's a kind of cure.
Go. They will slaughter us.
Let's buy pigs and leave.
Are you the chief?
- Yes, I am.
I want to buy some...
Meat?
- Meat.
I have some meat.
- Thank you.
Wait a minute. Money first.
No problem.
How much for one pig?
Two hundred for one.
I want two.
Three hundred.
- OK.
Three hundred?
- Yes.
Right.
O, shit.
Where are the pigs?
Over there.
Here?
Chief, please cover them.
Shit.
Can't you drive a car?
I'm moving out. It's down.
Why don't you watch out?
There was an elephant on the road.
An elephant. Why didn't you stop.
You should have stayed on the road.
I wanted to stop.
But I couldn't
and I ran into the tree.
Idiot. Now I know why my wife
hates you so much.
What do you mean by that?
Idiot? If not for me,
you wouldn't do good business.
I give you money. I feed you.
I pay your wages every month.
That lousy 1000 dollars?
You can't make a living on that.
I do all the work,
but I get paid the lowest.
I make good money? Fuck off.
I can get a job like this anywhere.
Who do you think you are?
- Repair the car. Don't go away.
I'm gone.
- You'll be eaten by crocodiles.
Repair the car yourself.
- Drop dead, asshole.
Stupid bastard.
You're always bullying me.
You are taking advantage of me.
One day you will be begging
on your knees.
She's heavy. Are you alright?
What big breasts.
I can't resist the chance.
Go for it first.
Wow, she is very dry.
These black babes are great.
Fantastic.
Damn, she's dying.
He's been bitten by a crocodile.
Fuck.
Let go off my dick.
Filthy whore.
So, you're back?
Aren't you going to walk back?
I thought you'd repair it,
so I came back.
Move over. I drive.
Why don't you say so?
Kai, what are you doing?
See if the food is done.
It is done.
- Bring it in.
I'm busy finishing this.
Take the food out.
What's the matter with you?
Fuck you.
What are you doing?
Want me to deduct your salary?
Give me a hand.
- No problem.
Enjoy your food.
Get up.
Don't you play games with me.
Is it bad, doctor?
He has a bad fever.
I advise you take him to a hospital.
That's not convenient right now.
I have given him an injection.
If his temperature doesn't go down
he may even die.
Die if you must, asshole.
Don't burden the world.
Shut up.
This is his medicine.
Thanks.
Doctor...
He and I visited a tribe today.
These people were very ill,
some were dying a terrible death.
Could they have infected him?
Which tribe was it?
- Zulu.
Zulu?
I don't know of any disease.
But I will look into it for you.
Did you have any physical contact?
I did not dare touch them.
I don't think you are infected.
I'll check it for you.
Thanks.
I'll see you to the door, doctor.
I wait for your good news.
Get water for his medicine.
Are you crazy?
We may be infected. You want us
to get ill like him?
Get him water for his medicine.
No.
- Then I will.
Don't you dare.
Why not?
- Boy, you are stupid.
You should not touch him.
If he dies, they will blame you
for his death.
Then what will you do?
Why do you do this?
- Why not?
He is illegal and a wanted convict.
If they find him, you go to jail.
I'm wanted too. - What do you mean?
Look at the stupid asshole.
We're lucky he's still alive.
If he dies...
I will never find anyone so cheap.
If he dies, we dump him in the wood.
- Let's dump him right now.
If he dies here,
we loose our customers.
He's still alive.
Kill him if you want.
Damn it.
I'm gonna beat you.
- Damn you. Beat me?
I will not screw you tonight.
Come in.
Doctor...
- Don't touch anything.
Where did you knock?
- Here.
Stay here.
Put this mask on before you speak.
- Is it so serious?
You went to Zulu area
together with that man?
Don't you touch anything.
Did you see the news on TV?
I never watch TV.
The TV news reported...
that the Zulu are infected
with the Ebola virus.
Ebola? What is it?
Never heard of it.
People with Ebola first
have symptoms of influenza...
but within 72 hours
after infection...
the virus will dissolve
the internals organs.
The infected person starts bleeding
externally.
Put the mask on.
Your saliva may infect me.
Is my employee infected with Ebola?
You were in infected area.
Your man shows all the symptoms.
Take him to a hospital.
The disease is carried
in the body liquid.
His saliva, his semen and his blood
carry the virus.
you may even be infected
by the water he drinks.
You and your wife should get
an examination in hospital.
Is it fatal if one becomes infected?
1 in 10 million people will have
an immune system...
If these people are infected...
they will get a high fever.
But then it stops.
They become carrier of the virus.
They spread it to other people.
I'll dump him outside now.
Don't look at me.
I will dig out your eyes.
Cousin? This is Ling.
I want to take that bastard
to the woods.
He's a troublesome guy.
This kind of guy deserves to die.
Come and help me.
You hate me so much?
You want me to die?
It's you or me. One of us must die.
Don't go away.
Help.
Fuck you, bastard.
What are you doing?
Stop it. Leave me alone.
What are you doing?
Let me go.
What are you doing?
Help.
Let's try this piece offat*.
Help.
Kai, what are you up to? Stop it.
Your wife bullied me,
so I screwed her.
Because she bullies you? Damn you.
- Don't come near.
Both of you bullied me long enough.
If you bully me, I will screw you.
Honey...
If you bully me, I screw you too.
Help me, honey...
Are you alright?
He bullies me.
Don't be afraid.
Asshole.
Go away.
Go to hell.
Darling...
Run, honey, run away.
Serves you right.
It's come off.
Don't kill me.
I'll do whatever you say.
Please don't.
Don't kill me.
Move. Stand up properly.
Filthy bitch. Turn around.
What will you show me now?
You bullied me all these years.
What will you do about that?
Squat.
Don't show a nasty face.
I will do a blowjob for you.
Dirty slut.
Be more lewd.
Now I finally understand...
why everybody is talking
about the women from Taiwan.
Get up.
Stand up. Now.
You want to bully me?
Shit, what's the noise? Quiet.
I must pay you back
for all these years you bullied me.
I'm coming.
Cousin Lin, can't you sleep?
Are you sick or so?
No, I feel fine.
Dirty bastard.
Little prick.
Mind your own business.
Damn you, asshole.
What a stupid dickhead I am.
I killed everybody and still I'm
working and cleaning up.
Ladies and gentleman,
children and adults.
This is African bun.
Morning, Kai.
Why isn't the boss here yet?
There was a phone call from Taiwan.
They take a flight back today.
When will he be back?
How should I know? Who cares?
Let's start work.
Table for two?
- Yes, two.
OK, sit.
Why did you make so many hamburgers?
No, these are African buns.
African buns?
It is good for business when you come
up with a new product now and again.
Very hot, is very good. Be careful.
Kai, why are you selling hamburgers?
No, these are African buns.
Didn't you hear?
I'll go and get one for you.
Serve them first.
You are frequent customer.
It's good. Very tasty.
They are very tasty.
Delicious.
Taste good?
- It is very good. What is this?
Meat from the buttocks part.
Are you joking?
The girl was moaning so loudly
last night...
Really?
- Are you serious?
Even if the boss is gone,
you still have to work.
There are no people.
Come, sit and talk a bit.
I was joking.
Why don't you find some whores?
You told us to...
Let's go find some whores.
I haven't slept for a long,
long time. I am very tired.
Where is it, filthy bastard?
Did you think you hid it so well
that I won't find it, asshole?
I am really quite smart.
Don't look so unhappy. After all
we are making this trip together.
But you were just a little girl
ten years ago.
You wouldn't recognize
him if you saw him.
Maybe it is fate that I should
find him here.
Fate doesn't exist really.
Hong Kong is so far away.
You will probably never
see him again.
You will only get that man
into trouble.
I have recognized his scent.
But how is that possible?
I will go back to that restaurant.
Will you accompany me?
Of course, I am curious
about that scent.
Anybody here?
What do you want?
We're closed. Go to some other place.
We don't want food.
I wanted to ask...
You lost your way?
Where do you want to go?
Are you alright?
She is sick. Sit down for a minute.
Thank you. Sit down.
Is she pregnant?
There is a hospital nearby.
You want me to order a taxi?
- No, thank you.
Have some tea.
- No, thank you.
Does a man named Kai work here?
The problem is...
My friend lost contact
with a relative.
She only knows he works in
a restaurant here.
I thought maybe...
- I remember. You looking for Kai?
There was a Kai working here before.
But he moved to another town.
I'll get you some tea.
He is Kai. I just can feel it.
Don't bullshit.
You don't recognize him.
How would you know?
He has a strong smell of blood
around him.
He works as a cook. If you kill ducks
and chickens you smell of blood.
But I have a very strong feeling.
Have tea.
- Thank you.
Where were we?
- You said Kai moved to another town.
Yes, a Kai worked here before.
He moved to another town to work.
I don't remember which town it is.
Thank you. We must go now.
Why don't you finish your tea first?
We are not thirsty.
- Have some tea. I insist.
Hi.
- Sorry to bother you.
We'd like to buy some food.
We have only African buns.
You want some?
POLICE STATION SOUTH AFRICA
Yes, can I help you?
I have important information
about a wanted murderer.
I'll get the inspector for you.
Inspector, These people
have important information.
Please go inside.
Miss Chow.
You tell me that you saw
a murderer from Hong Kong...
in a Chinese restaurant
in Johannesburg...
who disappeared ten years ago.
And you can't identify the man,
right?
Yes, but inspector...
I do have a strong feeling it is him.
He is the murderer. I am sure.
Look, Miss Chow.
How do you expect me
to arrest some person...
because you have the feeling
he is the murderer?
And even if I'm stupid enough
to do so...
the judge can't sentence him.
All because of your feeling.
I don't know how you feel,
but to me it's just outrageous.
Sorry, I can't help you.
Thanks very much.
In Hong Kong there's
lots of big boats.
Willie, what is it? My God.
Help.
Daddy.
- Darling, are you alright?
Call a doctor.
What is wrong, darling?
Oh my baby, my child.
Goodbye, asshole.
Scalpel, please.
We're now starting to make
a wide incision.
The lower intestine has liquefied.
The main organs have 'disglued'.
And the lungs have turned to mush.
Starting our examination
of the head...
we shall make an incision
to the throat.
The face has ulcers.
Facial muscular tissue
is badly decomposed.
I've never seen anything like this.
As if the muscular tissues
were trying to eat each other.
Excuse me, sir.
I got a report from the hospital.
All the dying patients
they all have...
the Ebola virus.
Ebola?
What can I do for you, sir?
What would you do for me?
I only trust myself.
This is my passport.
I've just arrived from South Africa.
I made reservations
for the penthouse.
Come in, Mr. Wong.
If you wish you can call
room service.
I will.
- I hope you will enjoy your stay.
I will manage.
This is your key, sir.
Put it down, idiot.
Thank you.
- Dickhead.
What do you think of this huge room?
Damn those stinking millionaires...
Room service.
Can you send me some chicks?
You want plain chicken or Hainan?
- I don't want to eat chicken.
I want some chicks.
- Sorry, we don't do that.
What? Why don't you
take good care of me?
I hope you have a very nice time.
Take good care of Mr. Wong, girls.
Sure.
- Don't worry about that.
Enjoy yourself.
This is for you.
- Oh, thank you.
Have nice night.
Take clothes off.
Hurry up.
Quick.
Kiss my body.
Smell good. Good.
Make good, I pay more money.
Kiss.
Turn around.
I want to get a condom first.
- You do that afterwards. Not now.
I pay more money without condom.
More money. No condom. Quick.
What are you hiding?
One, two, three. Three, two, one.
One, two, three, four. You're lucky.
Four, three, two, one.
Harder, harder.
Let me feel. So big. Like a cow.
Fantastic.
No more. Ouch, no more.
At first... You.
You are greedy. Go away.
Go.
I have got it. 'Wind from the West'.
What? Thirteen Orphans?
That's not fair.
Money, quick.
- I only came to eat, you know.
Helen, what is wrong with you?
- What is it?
You frighten me.
Quick, call an ambulance.
What is it? What's happened?
Officer Yeung,
why don't we apply to quit the case
I'll check on it. Quit if you want.
I was only joking.
- Good morning.
I am doctor Chung, the head
of the Pathology Department.
I am officer Yeung.
These are my assistants.
We've found a virus on these people.
They first showed symptoms of flue.
After two days
red incisions appear on their bodies.
These start bleeding
and milky fluid starts oozing.
More seriously,
mucus substance appears.
Within 48 hours
the patient will vomit, diarrhea...
and bleed from ears, eyes and mouth.
The internal organs stop functioning.
On the third day the symptoms
are becoming more serious.
Sorry to interrupt you.
Go and take a look at her.
Are you alright? Come and sit down.
Don't vomit. How embarrassing.
Please go on.
On the third and fourth day...
the likelihood that the patient dies
is a 100%.
There are people who only
get infected...
and become carrier of the disease.
That is a chance
of one out often million.
I hope the police can find
the source of the virus.
Ebola is a very infectious disease.
The more activities he has,
the more people will become infected.
The last time they were at work...
they had a drink with a Mr. Wong.
He paid for a 'full escort' for them.
You know his name?
Has he come before?
No, it was his first time.
He said he was doing business
in South Africa.
He was very generous.
He gave large tips.
He even gave tips in hundreds.
What is it, officer Yeung?
What happened to my girls?
Do they have aids?
No, no aids.
- What a big relief.
Would you recognize the man?
- Certainly.
That's part of my job.
I remember him for sure.
Take her for a sketch.
But I have to report for duty.
It will not take very long.
Make use of our skills.
Have a look, officer Yeung.
These are of the two birds.
It's sterile.
Why do you react like that?
I'm sorry.
Is it all sterile?
- Absolutely.
This way.
So the birds are dead?
So they can't give evidence.
You wouldn't even dare collect it.
You go in if you dare.
- I will go in.
Stop arguing.
Give me time to sort it out.
Why are we here, officer Yeung?
Can't you guess why?
I found matches from this hotel
in one of the women's handbag.
What does it mean?
At least one of them has been here.
So why are we here?
Have a good trip, sir.
I will.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, Miss.
I am officer Yeung.
Have you got a tenant
from South Africa?
Just a minute.
Sir, you want a car?
- Yes.
He's just checked out.
The man with the hat on?
- Yes.
Chase him.
Thank you.
Did a man with a hat on just leave?
He's just left in a taxi.
Oh. Wow, shit man.
According to the investigation...
the first batch of patients
all ate here...
on or just before March 28th.
Sir, the burger are made by Kai,
not me... Not me.
Where is this Ah Kai?
Kai has been gone for two weeks now.
The boss and his wife
have also disappeared.
Kai said they went to Taiwan.
But the boss his wife's in-laws phoned
from Taiwan looking for them.
Everybody has disappeared from here.
But we haven't been paid yet.
Is there anything you can tell me
about Ah Kai?
All I know he is a friend of the boss
and his wife. That's all I know.
I just remembered something.
- What?
I heard from the boss's wife...
that he came from HK ten years ago...
and that he killed somebody.
And he is on the run.
Gee, fuck.
We checked out that restaurant
like you said.
We have a suspect,
he's from Hong Kong.
The bad news is... He's run away.
We don't know where he's going.
Wait a minute, Andrew.
This Miss Chow was talking
about a murderer or something.
I'll get on to the Hong Kong Police.
I've just received a fax
from South Africa.
It's just as bad as in Hong Kong.
They have proved it's Ebola virus.
The source of the virus...
are the burgers from a Chinese
restaurant.
A Chinese restaurant sells burgers?
Sure, they send a fax saying so.
I suspect he is in Hong Kong now.
Go and check
the Immigration Department.
Get me a list of all visitors to HK
for this month.
Yes, sir.
Officer Yeung, are there other clues
besides what you told us?
Sure.
According to medical experts...
the one who spread Ebola in HK...
may be the same man
you met in South Africa.
That's the guy you reported
to the Police of S. Africa...
that you said he killed your parents.
Yes, but they didn't believe me.
If it's really Ah Kai...
then he was the one that killed three
persons in HK, fled to S. Africa...
and killed another three persons
in S. Africa and escaped back to HK.
And he brought the Ebola virus
with him.
What? That bastard.
I am not threatening you...
but if you ever meet the man again...
avoid close contact with him,
as this virus is lethal.
His body liquid, say...
his saliva, blood, sweat, urine...
and even his semen
is highly contagious.
As the disease spreads
through body liquid.
Officer Yeung,
the man killed my parents...
I was just telling you this.
Give it back to me.
Give it back.
- What's the money for?
For our daughter's school fee.
Kill her so you needn't pay.
Are you mad?
- You are a nut.
Bastard, how can you come in and
beat me all day?
I just wish you get infected by aids.
Be good. Let's go inside.
What? Why are you looking at me?
Har, you used to be a nice lady.
Don't you recognize me?
Kai.
Why must you curse me?
We haven't met for ten years.
Your daughter?
- Be good. Go inside.
I have to chat with uncle, okay?
What made you come here, Kai?
It's hard to find you...
- Shit.
I thought you were dead, why come?
Don't you curse me once you see me.
What kind of a relation is ours?
You went away suddenly
and come back suddenly again?
It's reasonable to curse you.
I killed someone by mistake.
So I had to go on large.
If I'd come here,
you'd have got involved.
I've been in South Africa
for ten years.
I've been thinking about you.
Shit, why are you back now?
Want to be arrested?
No, I'm not that poor Kai anymore.
I'm a rich Kai now. Look.
I made it myself. Do you like it?
Do you like my craftsmanship?
If I had not been a lunatic...
Now I have money...
I'm not telling lies.
Look, do you like it?
- Yes, I do.
I have lots of them.
- Very nice.
Take it back. Don't say I snatch it.
Why? You have a husband
who supplies you...
I'm already married.
My husband is called Ma.
How are you, asshole?
I just wanted to fuck him,
but he's rubbish.
I'm your real husband.
He just took my place
when I wasn't here.
Say no more.
Let me fuck you. Come on.
Bloody mouth.
Go to the toilet if you must.
Yes, let me rinse my mouth first.
Where's the toilet?
- Yes.
Shall I buy you a dress?
Kai, I found a jacket that suits you.
Put her down and try it on.
The material is good. Nice cut.
- This is even better.
Not funny at all... It's crowded her.
And the dress is too sexy.
It suits you well.
- Does it?
Is the dress nice?
- Yes, it is.
Does it match me?
- Yes.
Mom will look really nice
in that dress.
You are flattering me.
Do you want the jacket?
Yes, just buy it... Buy all of them.
Okay, let's go.
Let me carry you. Come on.
Why don't you eat? It's ice cream.
Don't you like it?
Be good, eat it.
Good girl.
I want too.
- You want too? You are grown-up...
No, it's mine.
- I don't give it to him, okay?
Come, we'll eat it.
Be good.
Is it nice?
Sir, do you still want it?
- No, thanks.
Take this away.
This is good. It's so long.
No, what is that?
- Good. Get a shorter one.
This is even better.
Are you mistaken?
Sorry. Sorry.
- Just sorry? You sprayed on me, jerk.
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
Excuse me.
- Don't do it again.
I'm terribly sorry.
What a lunatic.
- Sorry.
You get us into trouble.
How dare you bully me?
- Let's go.
I want Har back. Give me a price.
Okay, to the point.
I want 100,000 HK dollars.
How about it? Can I get a drink now?
Who do you think I am?
You treat me as saleable goods,
fucking bastard.
You committed adultery. I want money.
What are you talking about?
- Can I say something?
This is my wife.
She is very good in bed.
Let me go.
I've just fucked her. Want a try?
Don't cheat me, bastard.
- Can I fuck you?
Have you finished with you fun yet?
You fucking bastard.
Don't be angry.
- 100,000 dollars? Go away.
I'm worried you use the money
for heroin and kill yourself.
Here's 3,000 US dollars.
Buy your heroin and spend it.
Take it and piss off.
So few dollars? That's not enough.
Go away now. Otherwise I'll kill you.
Give me the bottle. Don't waste it.
Take it en get lost.
Never come back. Go.
Thanks, Brother Kai. Be seeing you.
I'm a lousy bastard.
Don't be annoyed.
Miss, are you alright?
May, what is the matter with you?
Call an ambulance. Quick.
What are you doing?
Why are you so frustrated?
Stop, please.
Officer Yeung, I'm Lily.
Kai is near Observatory Road.
Want to scare me?
- Sorry.
Has anyone just passed by?
- No.
Sorry, excuse me.
- Nut.
Are you looking for your friend?
No, I don't...
- Let me take you to see him.
Help.
Miss Chow, where is Kai?
- Kai is over there.
Kai is there.
There is blood on your mouth.
That's not my own blood.
Bastard, you must have stolen
my needle.
I told you to give it back.
Not steal it.
Give me back my needle.
Is it yours? I found the needle.
Are you OK?
Go away.
The detox suits are here.
Sign here, please.
Take a look. Go on.
That's not enough
for so many people here.
Is that all we have?
- Yes.
There are no more in HK?
- Medics in the frontline use them.
We will order some more.
- Very stylish.
Who will wear this?
The one in the frontline.
- I'm always at the back.
What is your position then?
Middle.
I don't fear gun battle...
but I'm really frightened
by that virus.
Take a rest.
No, this is mighty.
I am not used to being like this,
only when I meet you.
You're kidding.
When I masturbate it's different...
Come here.
What is it?
- Come up.
What? What trick is this?
Let's go back to the Mainland.
Immigrate?
- I must leave Hong Kong.
I am a wanted criminal after all.
This is a dangerous place. Come on.
Let's go to another place.
We'll fuck everyday.
OK, I'll go wherever you go.
Have you seen this guy?
- Yes.
Do you know where he is?
- At... At my home.
Here's local news.
- Drink your milk.
Police are looking
for a man named Kai.
He's 1.8 meter tall.
He is suspected...
to have murdered three persons
ten years ago and vanished.
According to information
from South Africa...
last month at a Chinese restaurant
the suspect killed...
his boss, the boss's wife
and her cousin.
He even cut up their flesh...
and used it to make hamburger meat.
Police and Medical dept. classify him
to be a highly dangerous person.
They believe he's infected
by a deadly disease.
The virus name is Ebola.
Eight persons
have been diagnosed positive.
They have been infected or died
as a result.
This man is believed to be
the source of it.
Should anyone see this man...
avoid close contact with him.
- Rubbish.
Contact the police.
- They're lying.
Goodnight.
- Police try to force me out.
Don't listen to this bullshit.
- The press always make up stories.
Eat it while it is hot. Sit down.
Drink your milk.
- You're alone...
Leave me alone.
Eat now. Eat it.
I'm going to the kitchen.
Why are you locking me up?
Open the door. Why did you lock it?
Want me to stay with you?
You're infected with Ebola virus.
You're doing me harm.
Look what you have in your hand.
- What do I have in my hand?
Open the door, bitch. Open up.
I'll report to the police.
I'll kill you, bitch. Open the door.
Open the door now. Don't go.
Bitch... I will kill you.
The bitch.
Help.
Officer Yeung, it's here.
You don't have no suit. Stay.
The rest follow me.
Help.
What is it? We're the police.
Ebola. Up there.
Is he called Kai?
Where is he?
Inside my house.
- Watch her for me.
He's got a knife.
Follow me.
- Come along.
He's upstairs.
Bastard. Don't.
Give my daughter back to me.
Give my daughter back to me.
- Piss off, bitch.
Take it easy. Don't panic.
- Don't come closer.
You're infected with Ebola.
Let her go.
Bitch, how dare you betray me?
Not her. You betrayed yourself.
Put down the knife.
- Don't come near.
If you come closer, I'll kill her.
Do you know
you're a Ebola virus carrier?
should go to hospital.
- I got Ebola? Sure.
Take it easy, put her down.
Idiot, come near if you dare.
What a thin piece of clothing.
You'll die if you get infected.
You pretend to be brave but
act like cowards when it's serious.
You're dressed up like robots.
Can't catch me.
- Don't go.
Disinfect everything here.
He's too excited.
Get anesthetics, quick.
Leave me alone.
Over there.
Don't push me...
If you dare, take off your suits.
Bastard, you're evil...
Don't come any closer.
Go away. Step aside.
Kai, put down the knife.
- Stop following me.
Give me back my child.
- Watch her.
It's dangerous. Don't go near.
Don't get in my way. I will kill you.
It's dangerous. Step aside.
Give me back my daughter.
Go away. Why you dress up like a dog?
Stupid bitch. Don't block my way.
Go away. Don't come near.
Mom.
- Har.
Mom.
- Don't come near.
Har, what is wrong?
Your virus has killed lots of
people. Let the child go.
How dare you blame me for it?
I didn't invent the Ebola virus.
God created Ebola, not me.
And his virus will kill
all you bastards.
What do you mean?
See, my blood is contaminated.
Har, get up. Stop shivering.
Don't come near her.
Don't follow.
Call for an ambulance.
Take her to a hospital.
Don't get near her, bastard.
Piss off.
Go away.
Don't move, or I'll fire.
Go away.
- Mom, help.
Why did you shoot?
Are you not afraid to kill the child?
Don't get near.
- Go ahead. Shoot.
If you're not afraid
of the Ebola virus.
Don't get near.
- Fire.
Stand still.
- Are you a brave cop?
Let's forget the hostage.
You think I will not kill you?
Kill you. Go ahead fire.
Asshole.
Ebola, let's spread together.
Run. Run.
Move away.
How dare you bully me?
It's not my fault.
Why, you injected me
with a poisonous shot?
Want to poison me?
Step aside. Run.
Do you know what 'Ebola' is?
No, it's not 'Deborah'...
Let's die together.
Don't go away.
Quick.
Save him.
You bastards, how dare you bully me?
Ebola.
Save him.
Hand me your gun.
Sir, someone got hit by a car.
- Go and check it out.
Officer Yeung.
- Don't come near.
The blood on my body is his.
I may be infected with Ebola virus.
Eat quickly, little girl.
We are going home.
Mom is waiting for us.
Eat quickly. We have to go.
Eat. Take a bite.
Bully me?
