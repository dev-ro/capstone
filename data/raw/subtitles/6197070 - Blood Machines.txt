We can still get rid
of these vultures.
Tracy, arm the cannons!
Tracy!
Tracy?
Tracy...
What's wrong, dear?
Damn it.
God damn it!
The fucking machine
isnt responding.
Calm down, its not her fault.
We didnt bust our asses
for two weeks to get ripped off.
I'm going out.
Bad idea.
I can't cover you without Tracy.
Let me check,
I can fix it.
Vascan! Dont!
Now, fix it.
Tracy must have been
malfunctioning
when she analyzed the air.
Trouble breathing?
Smells like a rotting corpse...
Lovely.
It reminds me of
Tracy's cooking.
I hope she's not listening.
Hey,
guess what kind of scavengers
these are?
What kind?
Women.
This wreck belongs to me!
Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey!
Good girl
She's between life and death.
I destroyed her
propulsion system.
Her flying days are over.
Murderer!
She is a living being.
You've got to be kidding me.
We can still heal her.
Not anymore!
Easy, tiger!
Youll make it harder
for our technicians.
We need to pump your ship.
Back away.
Now!
I warned you.
Im sorry to dis...
Tell them to get off our ship...
Now!
Cover me!
Piece of shit!
All right!
Let's do this old school.
Bad idea!
Stop! Youll?
Lago! What's going on?
My heart?
Give yourself a jolt..
You don't even respect
your own ship!
Bulk!
Tracy!
Why can't you understand
we're here to do good?
By destroying one ship
to fix another?
That doesn't make any sense.
Why is a fridge
better than a toaster?
Its just a drip-feed.
No big deal.
Tracy,
don't give up on me.
A little effort, my dear.
Wicked creatures!
Weve lost her.
Please, hey.
Everything can be fixed...
What if I blow your head off?
Can you fix that?
Her death was too brutal.
Prepare the ceremony,
we've lost enough time.
Am I the only one seeing
a naked girl in the sky?
Just checking.
