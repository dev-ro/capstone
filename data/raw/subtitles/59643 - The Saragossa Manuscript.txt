The Saragossa Manuscript
Forward!
Follow me!
You are a prisoner.
No resistance, please.
Can you hear me?
Wait a minute, friend,
until I finish
admiring these drawings.
What about the enemy?
Carry on the pursuit!
Interesting.
Very much so.
Too bad I don't know Spanish.
Look, this is about
my grandfather.
"The Count Olla Vedez who,
at that time,
had not yet brought
the settlers to the Sierra... "
Captain!
They're surrounding us.
What shall we do?
Why don't you close the door?
It's drafty!
Where was I?
Here, I think.
"... the Sierra Morena,
"a steep range between Andalusia
and La Mancha.
"At that time,
it was populated,
"with robbers and gyp"
Thank you, "gypsies...
"and gypsies, of whom
it was said,
would eat the corpses
of killed wanderers. "
Will we make it before dark?
Before dark?
Three da y s aren't enough
to cross these mountains.
Where will we sleep?
It becomes dark very quickly.
Sometimes you can find
a deserted inn at the roadside,
because infernal ghosts
chased out the inn keepers,
and when evil ghosts...
So what?
A traveler who comes here should
be prepared for the very worst.
I am not scared of them.
I can handle them.
Listen to Mosquito!
Saddle the mules and follow me,
and hurry!
Sir, demons rave there
and in visible hands push you
into the abyss.
The devils have goats' hooves,
not feet.
Let's go through Estramadura.
The sights are prettier there.
We'll go straight on
and stop here,
at the cork oaks,
where we will have our food.
Then we'll spend the night
at Venta Quemada.
And the next day,
get supplies and prepare
to cross the mountains.
And in three da y s' time,
exhausted but happy,
we'll ride triumphantly
into Castile.
That's my plan and nothing
is going to change it!
He'll ruin us.
Since King Don Philip V
honored me
with the rank of captain
of the Walloon Guard,
it is my duty to find the
shortest way to Madrid.
My young lord,
maybe the king has honored you
with a captains rank,
but reason has not done
the same for your brains.
It would be good
to quench our thirst.
Water isn't good after fruit.
Where is the mule attendant?
I don't like all this.
He has gone off
with all our supplies.
Sir, evil ghosts
have kidnapped poor Mosquito.
He's escaped!
Damned rascal,
I didn't like his shrewd eyes
right from the start.
Why didn't I listen to
Brother Jerome de la Trinidad,
holy monk and preacher?
Mosquito!
He said the officers
of the guard were heretics.
Shut up, stupid!
I'll catch him and break his
bones if he fled from fear.
Don't leave me alone here, sir.
Then you go.
No, sir, I will not go.
Well, we'll talk later.
Mosquito!
Two foreign ladies
who are staying here
would like to invite you to supper.
Will you please follow me,
caballero?
Señor caballero,
thank you
for your kind acceptance
of this modest supper.
Appease your hunger, sir.
You probably haven't eaten
since early morning.
Are you surprised
at our meeting?
My name is Emina
and this is my sister, Zibelda.
We live in Tunisia,
but we come from Grenada,
where our relatives still adhere
to our forefathers' faith.
Our journey
is an important secret
which we want to confide
to your honesty.
That was what we expected,
señor caballero. 
I took a seat near you to tell
you our family's story.
Listen carefully.
Does this lock et contain
a picture of your mistress?
This jewel is a gift
from my mother
and it contains
a fragment of a genuine relic.
Does it frighten you?
Only evil ghosts
are afraid of relics.
We are Muslim, so don't be
surprised at my sister.
Too bad our closest relative
follows a strange faith.
Am I your relative?
You are.
Your mother was
a Gomelez.
We also belong
to that family.
I've never heard
of it.
Aren't you wrong,
dear ladies?
No.
I promised to tell you
the story of our ancestors,
but I think it would be better
if I start with my own.
Sit down.
We were waiting for you.
Had you chosen another road
out of fear,
we'd have lost
respect for you.
You are
flattering me, Emina,
but I never turn off the road
I have chosen.
But why are you
so concerned with my courage?
We are concerned
about you.
Me?
Maybe you will feel less
flattered when I tell you
that you are the first man
we have ever met.
My sister speaks the truth.
We never had a brother.
And lock ed up in the harem
since we were children,
we never had the slightest idea
about your sex.
But nature gave us
the inclination to love.
We gave each other
our love.
This is beginning
to look interesting.
My sister and I
love each other dearly.
Seeing this,
our mother said,
we would either remain maidens
or marry one man
Her assurance
somewhat calmed our anxiety.
The head of the family agreed
that we could marry one man,
provided he was a Gomelez.
Is it...
Is it me?
It is.
This is the idea
we liked best.
But my religion,
my faith!
Don't you
like us, Alfonso?
Arent we nice?
It's nearly dawn.
Time is too precious
to be wasted on idle talk.
We cannot become
your spouses unless
you accept
the Prophet's law.
You will be allowed
to see us in your dreams only.
But you have to keep our existence secret.
Do you agree?
Pass the chalice!
But remember your promise.
My dear cousin,
why aren't you Muslim?
How happy I would be,
if seeing you...
on Emina's lap,
I too could call my self
your wife.
Come with me, my son.
Woe to him who,
in his wicked inflexibility,
refuses to confess his sins.
Do not spend the nights
under the skies.
And beware of all temptations,
as the Lord has lifted His hand.
I will do as you say, Father,
but first...
my belly requires
refreshment.
Think about
your soul's salvation
and I'll look after
your body's needs.
Strange things were happening
last night.
Did you stay in the deserted inn
by any chance?
I visited Venta Quemada.
But I have my reasons
for being reluctant
to explain it to you.
Devils are tempters.
Beware of Satan
and pride, my son!
Yes, yes,
beware of Satan.
I am amazed at
your courage
Tell me, young man, who are you
and who raised you up?
Do you believe in ghosts?
Me? Why should I?
Have no fear.
This one is possessed, and I am
chasing the devil out of him.
Pasheko!
In the name of Our Lord,
I order you to drive
the goats uphill!
Here is an example of how
the Angel of Darkness
is still ruling
this unfortunate neighborhood.
I am giving him
much of my time.
I think I will be able
to save him.
He's been making
great progress lately.
He milks these goats?
Yes.
Can you satisfy
my curiosity, my son?
I was asking for
details of your life.
You honor me, Father,
and you will
know everything.
I come from a family who had
more prominent men than wealth.
My father, a colonel
of the Walloon Guard,
was an extremely kind and
honorable gentleman.
In the name of Van Worden!
You'll pa y
for this, rascal!
A horse, bring me
a horse!
What are you
waiting for, cowards?
I have a feeling this is going to
end badly.
Señor, I request you grant me
a moment to talk.
-
-
Señor, I do not have
the pleasure of knowing you.
You'll know me
in a while.
Señor. 
After you.
After you.
Your coach, señor,
has outrun my carriage.
There is something offensive
in that,
and I would like you
to justify it.
Señor, it seems it wasn't
my coachmen who outran yours,
but yours who were dragging
along and were left behind.
I admit you are right.
Too bad that you didn't say that
before I drew my sword.
Señor, I understand you
perfectly well.
Excuse me for
having taken your time.
Oh, don't mention it.
May I?
But of course, señor. 
I'll be getting back to my roast
which may not be quite cold yet.
Water!
Why did he have his coach
chopped up?
He'd be more comfortable.
After it lost the race,
he couldn't look at it anymore.
Water!
I would have sold it.
A nobleman like him never sells,
he just destroys.
Everything I have
for a drop of water.
Did you hear that?
If you had water,
you'd be a rich man.
He's mad to start
all these duels.
If you have a master
who likes collecting wounds,
you have to be
ready for anything.
God damn it!
I'd sell my soul
for a drop of water.
I have invited you all
to attend my wedding,
every one with whom I have had
the pleasure of crossing swords
at least once and whom, of
course, I havent killed.
You came to rejoice with me.
I need your advice.
Here is a letter
from the may or of Bayon,
asking me to take possession
of my ancestral castle
in the Ardennes.
Should I leave
the king's service
or leave my heritage
to its own fate?
If you vote...
I'll do
as you advise.
Please hurry, señores,
or the meat will be quite cold.
Farewell, my king and lord,
farewell, sunny Spain,
and I invite you to a feast
at my castle in the Ardennes.
Who will pa y?
This is a great loss!
This is going to ruin me!
Follow me!
Nothing can equal
our sunny Spain.
This was a stupid idea.
I don't think
I'll ever sing
a serenade
to the most beautiful señorita. 
Hush.
True, it's not
the same.
I don't envy
the bride and groom.
Long live
the bride and groom!
I wish your son
a prompt return to Spain.
Señora, our son
will be named Alfonso.
Señores, continue your feast.
I, a true Spaniard,
have to fulfill my duties.
Señora, this rain reminds me
of the siege of Lerida,
when I stood up to my waist
in water.
They were beautiful times.
I was famous
for my bravery then.
Exactly nine months later,
I was born.
You told us a nice story.
It seems your father
is a man of honor.
Have you inherited
this virtue?
Boasting is not a feature of
a Walloon Guard officer, Father.
Before you start
your own story,
I'll ask Pasheko
to bring you some fresh mil k.
No, I better start
straight away.
I was brought up away from home
to learn the way s of a nobleman.
"... and the lid flew open.
I saw a skeleton coming out.
"I drew my sword, but the
skeleton tore off its left hand,
"using it as a weapon,
and fiercely attack ed me.
"I was defending my self bravely
"when another skeleton
jumped out,
"snapped off
a rib of the first,
and struck me with
all his might. "
Welcome, son!
It's been so long,
so many years
My dearest son!
You didn't forget
your holy alphabet, my son?
Or my sophisticated
teachings?
No, I've been
studying hard.
Show us then, son.
Very well,
excellent.
Dear Eureko, leave manly things
to men.
The time has come
to show you the ultimate stroke.
It's extremely complicated,
but once you've mastered it,
you'll be
one of the best fencers.
En garde!
Dear Eureko!
I fought 130...
yes, my son, 130 duels.
I'll give you
all my experience now.
Allez!
I failed again.
You were
the finest fencer.
Don't worry, Alfonso will
take over with honor.
Return to
your fatherland, son.
Spain is the loveliest country
in the world.
I'll do my best to help you
become a Walloon Guard captain.
Thus I came here,
and last night
Well, dear son, I've become
very interested in your story.
I can also see that you received
a good education.
However, as you spent last night
at the Venta Quemada...
What was I saying?
Oh, I am afraid you could have
been haunted by two hanged men.
I wouldn't like you to have the
same fate as Pasheko.
Don't be afraid, Father.
My mother told me that
in the old days,
you may have come across
possessed people,
but today they are no more.
What?
Havent you seen the awful
possessed Pasheko,
whose eye the devils
have gouged out?
Pasheko!
His story may contribute
to the salvation of your soul.
I will order him to begin.
Pasheko!
In the name of Our Lord,
I order you to tell your story
to our guest.
I was born in Córdoba.
My father was prosperous.
You may leave
that out, Pasheko.
His mother died
three years ago,
and his father
decided to marry a young widow.
Camilla de Tormes.
They were
wed in Seville.
A few days later, my father
returned with his new wife...
and her sister, Inezillia.
My dear wife, my lady, I bought
some mules for your coach,
and for you, lovely Inezillia,
a sapphire ring.
You are the best husband, señor,
and brother-in-law.
Inezillia is ecstatic,
aren't you, Inezillia?
Thank you
with all my heart.
Do not eat fruit, Inezillia,
you know it is bad for you.
I am glad
you are happy.
Camilla, we would like to hear
your songs,
as we always do after lunch.
Oh yes, Camilla,
do sing for us!
Come with me, sister,
to get the instruments.
I beg your permission, Father,
to marry beautiful Inezillia.
We will go to Madrid and start
a wonderful life there.
Forget it, son.
First of all, it would be
unbecoming for you to be
your father's brother in law.
Secondly, church laws ban
such alliances, and thirdly
I love her more
than my own life.
And thirdly...
I do not want you
to marry Inezillia.
Don't worry, Pasheko.
If your father won't allow you
to marry my sister,
there are no obstacles at all
to your being her lover.
Señora, Inezillia is an angel
of purity, how could I
Leave it to me, Pasheko,
my sister will listen
to my request,
which I will pronounce
with pain in my heart.
Pasheko, Pasheko,
who can resist you?
Make it
shot, Pasheko.
Now tell me how soon after
your father set out
on the trip to Madrid, taking
his wife and her sister along.
The da y s without Inezillia
were unbearable.
I missed her and suffered.
Manuela!
In Venta Quemada?
That's where you are
to wait for him.
Cruel gangs are roving
the Sierra Morena.
It's quiet since those two thugs
the Zota brothers, were hanged.
Will Inezillia be accompanying
my father?
Yes, señor. 
No more delay.
Inezillia.
We'll always be together.
Can I eat at your place?
And spend the night?
Señor, by St. Parazito,
don't do it!
Have you no clean bedclothes?
I am ready even
for the king's court.
Well?
Here, ghosts rave
all night.
Ghosts?
Even we go
to the next village at night.
It's scary here,
at night.
My friend,
we'll sleep with ghosts.
As you wish, señor,
but allow me and my wife
to leave the inn for the night.
I'll keep the ghosts
from stealing things.
Where are you going?
Señor, don't play around
with ghosts. I'm scared.
Then go with them,
you weakling.
Pasheko, the moment
has come.
Your father is asleep and
Inezillia is waiting for you.
Come on, come on,
come on
Everything is
going well, Pasheko.
Just look.
Indeed.
I'll tell you
when the time is right.
Pasheko, Pasheko.
We are waiting for you.
Inezillia, do you really desire
a lover?
You will be lovers
but I will always be with you.
Kiss!
Hard!
You love Inezillia
and I love you.
She will refuse you nothing,
but remember my condition.
Well, son,
what do you think?
I think you would get scared
in such circumstances, too.
A nobleman
is afraid of nothing.
Then let Pasheko continue
with his story.
I may hear
something interesting.
Pasheko!
In the name of God,
I order you to continue.
I ran for my life
from right under the gallows,
and roamed far off the road
all da y.
I know what
you want to say.
Had I come earlier, there'd be
a feast fit for a king.
Indeed.
Now the ghosts
have taken over
And you are spending the night
in the next village.
Allow me, señor,
to leave you.
Was there a
nobleman from Córdoba
and two women yesterday?
Try to remember
a nobleman from Córdoba.
My wife left your supper
on the stove, señor. 
On the stove.
Pasheko!
Make room for me
right near you.
I am trembling
with cold.
It's me,
your Inezillia.
Be gone, Satan!
You are chasing us away?
Come on, sister,
we'll light the fireplace.
Well, my son?
I can see you now realize
the power of Satan.
It is getting late.
I am not offering you
a place here.
Pasheko's screams wouldn't
let you close your eyes.
Go to the chapel.
To the chapel?
To the chapel.
But I'll hear him
there too.
He has
such a terrible yell.
Son, I know what
I'm telling you.
Oh yes,
to the chapel.
You will sleep
quietly there.
Kneel down at the altar,
confess your sins and repent.
There's still time
to prevent evil.
I don't think I have sinned,
unless I did it in my dreams.
Who is there?
We're cold, it is us,
your mistresses.
Go back to your gallows,
I want to get some sleep!
You sneer at us,
because you're in a chapel!
But come join us
out in the graveyard.
At your service.
But tomorrow!
I can see you're nervous,
my son
And it's not surprising.
Last night, wicked spirits
were up to terrible mischief.
The goats
were bleating.
Devils may assume
various forms, my son.
They somehow stay away
from me, Father.
I can see you still have faith,
but I'm worried
you won't be able
to keep it.
I will, I will.
I don't want to keep you
any longer.
You have a long journey.
By the day after tomorrow,
you'll have crossed
the Sierra Morena.
You'll find some supplies
by your saddle.
What's the shortest way
to Madrid?
I have never been to Madrid,
my son
I know, however,
you have to go...
that way.
Thank you...
Father.
But remember, my son,
that God has raised his arm.
Señor Alfonso Van Worden?
Yes, captain of
the Walloon Guard.
You're under arrest
in the name of
the Holy Inquisition.
Señor, give us
your sword.
Gentlemen, señores,
I'm a nobleman!
What an incredibly
noisy sinner.
I hope he'll be as talkative
in front of the Holy Tribunal.
According to our system,
we allow the prisoner
the freedom to accuse himself.
His confession, even though
slightly forced,
has its advantages,
when the prisoner is willing
to name his collaborators.
Do you know
two African princesses?
The longer your silence,
the worse it'll be for you.
I can see I'm going
to have to help you.
Let's start
the first trial.
You're going
to faint soon,
but with salt and alcohol,
we'll bring you round.
Let's start
the second trial...
Alfonso!
You're saved, Alfonso!
Señor Zoto is coming
to rescue you.
Dear Alfonso!
You've shown great courage,
dear cousin.
This is no time
for kisses.
By the time the guards arrive,
you should be far away.
This is Señor Zoto.
Señor Alfonso, I have the honor
of introducing my brothers,
Chico...
Muma and Chico.
How come, Zoto?
Your brothers were hanged,
weren't they?
You heard right.
But as you can see for yourself,
they're fine.
But I saw them myself!
What you saw were two shepherds,
hung to pacify the neighborhood.
This is unbelievable.
Undoubtedly, it's thanks
to our horses.
I'm pleased to see
you are yourself again.
Bless you, señor. 
They're surrounding us.
Chico, you cover us
while we get to the horses.
Where's my sword?
My sword!
Kiss me.
And me.
Oh, how happy I am.
Are you pleased
about our meeting, cousin?
Cousin,
this locket is horrible.
It's cooling our passion
towards you.
Are you happy, cousin?
Yes, although I must say
that the end of the night
I spent with you,
didn't please me at all.
You'd better accuse us
with pleasures.
It wasn't so nice
in the morning.
Let's say no more
about it.
Here's a plait made of our hair,
a talisman
to remind you of us.
Talisman?
It's widely assumed
one can only love one woman.
It's a fallacy.
I fell in love
with you both equally.
My heart sees no difference.
Adopt our faith.
You would sit on the throne
in Tunis
among harems, gardens
and fountains.
No, no.
Let's not talk about kingdoms
flooded with sunshine.
We're in the abyss,
close to Hell.
How dare you be in the company
of Golomez women!
Cousin, you're
done for!
Forgive us.
Either you'll be killed
like a coward with an axe
and your corpse hung next
to the Zota brothers
at the mercy of crows
and devilish powers, or
But the brothers...
Or you'll drink the potion
from this chalice.
Gulp it down!
Father, you'd do the same in the
name of honor, wouldn't you?
What an unpleasant
misunderstanding.
Evil spirits
take so many shapes,
it's completely
confusing.
You're here too?
You're too young to be
a cabalist,
though you too are carrying
a rope around your neck.
Don't worry.
You are brave, I know,
though you've
not had much experience.
You're Alfonso?
Your mother is a Gomelez
and you are a captain
of the Walloon Guard.
Let's leave
this unpleasant place
and decide what
to do next.
My name is
Alfonso Van Worden.
That's evident.
I can see
you have mellowed.
I have a miraculous potion
to restore your strength.
No, no,
no more miraculous potions!
Where are you
going, señor?
To Madrid.
Good.
On our way we'll stop at a place
where I left a good meal.
Not miraculous,
but sumptuous.
Now listen, the books of
Nach Sou Chasi
contain wise Chaldean knowledge,
while the verses of
Shir Ha Shi Mir
contain the purest beauty
of poetry.
In Hebrew, every letter is
a number,
every word
a very wise combination.
If it is pronounced with
the right exhalation and accent,
one may move mountains
and drain rivers.
You must know that Adonai
created the world with a word...
Someone played a joke on me here
last night,
But let's go in
anyway.
My horse!
Unbelievable!
Mine too.
I don't understand.
The horse
follows his master.
It's lucky that devils
do not need food.
Good, isn't it?
What's good?
Just asking.
I am pleased to be able
to satisfy your hunger.
What's that?
It must be
your property.
Then you too have spent
the night here?
Yes, but I won't tell you
the whole story.
It was
a wonderful night...
in spite
of everything.
In spite of what?
I have also given my word.
To whom?
Two beautiful women,
but do not ask for more.
Let's set off.
It's still
a long way to Madrid.
Do you know
a quicker way, señor?
Yes, that way.
That's where the Inquisition
fell upon me.
You're right,
it's better to avoid an ambush.
Is there any other path?
Of course,
for a cabalist.
We'll go around and come out
on the one to Madrid.
Seter So Har shows us
the depth of the ten elements,
creating integrity
of taste.
All this enables us
to get to the powers
ruling pandemonium.
Must you always
talk in riddles?
It makes my journey
more interesting.
And they rule
nightmares and demons,
among which we can distinguish
Hungarian and Polish zombies...
Help!
I arrest you in the
name of the Inquisition!
Give up your sword!
Do not resist,
Alfonso Van Worden!
I am
Don Pedro Velasquez!
Are you crazy,
señores?
Indeed.
It's not him.
Who is he?
Don Pedro.
He look s rather similar.
What are you doing here?
I thought the roads
were for everybody.
Señores bandits!
There is no road here.
Get off!
He must have gone
the other way.
Maybe he went back
to Venta Quemada.
I was told
he was coming this way.
You don't seem eager
to apologize for this mistake.
Stop bothering us!
In that case, I will apologize
to the honorable señores. 
A thorn.
There is nothing with which
to take it out.
And there is
no place to hide,
just to examine the situation,
of course.
Señor Alfonso Van Worden?
Some ill mannered thugs
await you over there.
The Inquisition?
Yes.
Why should the Inquisition
be here?
They didn't recognize
you werent Van Worden?
They probably didn't,
if they held me up.
That's what logic
would dictate.
And what now?
You will ride to my castle,
señor, a few miles away.
You have a castle
in the neighborhood?
You didn't mention it.
It just proves
the beauty of modesty.
What if they find me?
They cannot enter my castle.
We'll take the shortest route.
If I too could take advantage
of your hospitality,
I could hope for
a quiet night.
Knowing the señor cabalist,
I know he won't refuse shelter.
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
I will have time to reconsider
everything that's
happened to me.
That could drive
an inexperienced person insane.
The human mind is ready
to accept anything,
if it is used knowingly.
End of Part One
The Saragossa Manuscript,
Part Two
Enrico, the master
has arrived!
Has something happened?
I don't know.
Let's rest after the rigors
of the journey.
Señor, you're
completely safe here.
My house is
at your disposal.
Fifteenth century.
You're an expert
on everything.
Curiosity distinguishes us
from animals.
I look, listen
and draw conclusions.
Señor, I am pleased to have met
you and to be in your company.
Good company is more precious
than wealth or black magic.
Gentlemen, this is not the place
for disputes.
Please go in.
Enrico, show the gentlemen
the way.
You were to be here
in three days time.
Unforeseeable complications.
Everything got
mixed up.
And what now?
What now?
I don't know.
We must keep him here.
I await new instructions.
Who's the other one?
Careful!
As k no more.
Go and
make yourself becoming.
You might
have told me.
You're boring me, my dear.
It was not possible.
I have the impression
that all this is happening
because of
evil spirits.
I'd rather
blame people, señor. 
Someone must be
after you
to put you through
all these misfortunes.
I'm in your debt, señor,
as it seems that thanks to you,
I'll find the key
to this riddle.
I like it here.
Peace and quiet.
Think it all through
once again.
Have all your needs
been met, señor?
I don't know
how to thank you.
Not at all.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you. I feel fine here,
I'm really well.
I've thought
everything through.
And?
It'd be best for me to go
to Madrid as soon as possible.
I hope I'll be able
to make it in the dark.
The Inquisition is still
guarding all the roads.
Maybe Señor Velasquez
has some good advice?
He's an unbeliever.
What shall I do then?
Wait.
You have books here.
All the wisdom in the world
is to be found on these shelves.
I particularly recommend
the Spanish stories.
Señor Don Pedro,
I've found the answer.
Let's have some wine.
Perhaps this midnight oil
will mark our vigil
for the last time
tonight.
Come, señor, please,
I'd like to show you something.
You're sad.
Let's drink
this fine wine.
We'll all soon come to rest
in the eternal night.
How could you be
so careless?
If he had read the end,
the events which are to follow
would make no sense.
Luckily,
I arrived in time.
Strange things are happening
here, señor. 
I've seen it with my own eyes,
I even had it in my own hands.
It must be all due
to the evil spirits.
