- Afternoon, Parker.
- Good afternoon, sir.
General Faversham is waiting
for you on the terrace.
- Dr Sutton, sir.
- You've had a long journey, Doctor.
It's worth the journey
to join old comrades.
- Are they all coming?
- Same crowd, a year older.
- Sit down, help yourself.
- Thank you.
Well, what's the news from London?
Haven't you heard?
Gordon's dead, murdered in Khartoum.
That's no news to me.
I said that would happen years ago,
when Gordon was first sent to Egypt.
He wasn't hard enough.
They wanted someone like you out there.
Just what I was going to say meself.
First time for 100 years there
isn't a Faversham in the army
and look at the mess they make!
I'm too old and the boy's too young.
Me own fault for not marrying sooner.
You remember the boy,
he's 15 years old today.
I'm going to let him dine with us tonight.
- Oh, good.
- I can tell you, I'm worried about him.
- Oh?
- I can't understand the boy.
I sent him to
the best army school in England,
always tell him about
his famous ancestors
and I found him this morning
reading a poetry book!
Shelley, of all people!
I want you to help me lick this boy
into shape - make him hard.
Gentlemen, the Crimea!
- Old comrades!
- Old comrades!
Arnold, Raglan...
Crimea, by Jove.
War was war in those days.
And men were men,
no room for weaklings.
Balaclava, for instance.
You fellows remember the positions.
Now...
Here, these nuts were the Russians.
Guns, guns, guns.
On the right, the British infantry,
the Thin Red Line.
There was the commander in chief,
and here was l,
at the head of the old 68th.
The right was impassable,
the left was blocked,
behind us was the commander in chief.
I realised the position in a flash.
I said, "The 68th will move forward."
One of my subalterns came to me,
shaking. Absolutely shaking.
I said, "What's wrong, Travers?"
"I'm afraid to face those guns, sir."
I said, "Would you rather face me?"
Hmpf! He took one look at my face
and off he went.
Later, he was shot to pieces
at the head of his men,
as a soldier should be, eh?
I quite agree.
I can tolerate nerves before a battle
but I can't stand cowardice.
I recall a soldier at Inkerman
facing a charging Cossack.
I saw a man fumble with his musket,
then turn and run.
The Cossack's lance went straight
through his neck.
Best thing that could've happened.
Remember Wilmington?
- Who?
- Fine old service family.
Father killed at Inkerman,
grandfather blown up under Nelson,
an uncle scalped by Indians.
A splendid record.
What happened?
He was ordered to gallop
through the lines with a message.
Paralysed with funk, couldn't move.
General sent his adjutant -
killed before he'd gone 50 yards.
Sent his ADC - head blown off.
Then he took the message himself,
lost his arm.
- Ruined his cricket.
- Oh, yes, I remember.
He disgraced his family,
his father disowned him.
Hung about a year or two,
then blew his brains out.
He had the courage
to blow his brains out.
Courage?
Last spark of decency, that's all.
There's no place in England
for a coward.
Harry, past 11.
Time you were in your bed.
No, no - sit ye down,
my boy, sit ye down.
It's his birthday and
we've not drunk his health.
A toast to Harry, and may he prove
the bravest of the Favershams.
To Harry!
- Thank you.
- That's right, boy.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Harry.
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night, my boy.
Harry?
You don't remember me.
I remember you, though,
when you were about so long.
I was doctor in your father's regiment
in the Crimea.
I knew your mother too,
she was my friend.
I'd like you to think of me
as your friend too.
If ever you should need me,
here's my card.
It's not much use
to anybody nowadays
but if ever you feel the need,
write to me. Come and see me.
That's very kind of you, sir. Thank you.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Harry.
Section! Left! Wheel!
Stand at...ease!
Ten years ago, General Gordon
was murdered in Khartoum
and the British Army was withdrawn into
Egypt without punishing the crime.
Today, the Royal North Surrey Regiment
is under orders to join
Sir Herbert Kitchener's army
for the reconquest of the Sudan.
What's Egypt like, John?
- Principally sand, sweat and sunstroke.
- Lovely. When do we start?
- Can't say.
- Not before Thursday?
No, it took them 10 years to decide,
we'll be lucky to start in a month.
Then I'll give you these. Mr Harry
Faversham, Capt John Durrance
- and one for Fat-face Willoughby.
- What's all this?
An invitation to the
Burroughs family beanfeast,
with string band, strawberry ices
and hired waiters.
My sister's coming of age.
Ethne's 21 so Father's letting himself go.
- Champagne?
- Gallons.
- Oysters?
- In June?
I had them at my coming out.
I had the sense to be born in March.
Father will be terrific.
He's written four speeches,
been rehearsing them in the bathroom.
"My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen,
officers of my old regiment,
"this is an occasion for double rejoicing.
"I can announce not only
my daughter's coming of age
"but also her engagement to the son
of my old comrade in arms,
"Mr Harry Faversham of the
Royal North Surrey Regiment."
- What, him?
- Our own Harry Faversham.
- This is very sudden.
- It's been planned for months.
- Good luck, Harry.
- Thanks.
Good luck, Harry.
- Thanks, John.
- What about Egypt?
You can't take her.
When the dervishes catch you,
they cut off your nose
and hang you upside-down.
All the money falls out of your pockets.
I'll see you at dinner.
- Oh. Did I frighten the poor lamb?
- Shouldn't be surprised.
What's come over him?
Can't take a joke.
Never takes a drink, moons about
all day, reads poetry all night.
If that's love, give me indigestion.
Oh. Time to get changed. So long.
So long.
I'm sorry. I was a fool to make a joke of it
like that, I know how you feel.
That's all right, Peter.
It was for her to decide.
I wish it had been you all the same.
See you at mess.
After all, there are plenty of other girls.
Plenty. For other men.
Many years ago, I fought in the Crimea,
beside that very gallant soldier,
General Faversham,
whose death last year
was such a loss to us.
Hear, hear.
Tonight I am proud to announce
the engagement of my daughter
to Harry Faversham,
my dear old friend's only son.
Bravo!
10 years ago, when Harry was a boy,
I raised my glass in his honour
with the toast "May he prove
the bravest of all the Favershams."
Harry Faversham, coupled with
the name of my daughter Ethne.
To Harry!
Good luck, Harry!
The company is now dismissed,
the business of dancing
will now commence.
Well, Colonel, you're off
on this Egyptian affair, eh?
Of course, it's only a minor campaign.
It'll do you a world of good.
- The army's too soft nowadays.
- You mean not hard enough?
Of course! Now, the Crimea.
Ah! War was war in those days
and men were men.
Let me tell you
what happened at Balaclava.
- You remember the positions, Doctor.
- Only too well.
I was over there, on the extreme left.
Here were the Russian batteries,
behind the nuts. Guns, guns, guns.
On the right, the British infantry -
the Thin Red Line.
- I suppose they didn't get much to eat.
- What are you talking about?
You said they were so thin.
- The line, I meant! Not the men.
- Oh.
Here was the commander in chief.
And here was l,
at the head of the old 68th.
- Sorry Father dragged Egypt into it.
- Tired of Egypt already?
We have it for breakfast and lunch,
the honour of the regiment for supper.
He understands you're marrying me
and not the regiment?
He's not quite sure about that.
Are you quite sure?
When we're old and
creaking with rheumatism,
we shall think back to this night.
- Ethne, you'll never creak.
- We'll creak with the best of them,
and through the creaks will come
the sound of this dance music,
and the light of the moon
and the scent of the flowers.
This is a solemn occasion, Harry.
A memory is being born tonight.
A memory that will stand
the test of all the years.
Moments like this
are better than memories.
The memories will be the best,
because they'll be out of reach
of uncertainty and care.
Memories just float about on their own,
with no shadows upon them.
Dance music, the moon
and evening primroses, that's all.
You're not going to rob me
of my solitary dance, Ethne?
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
Is this your dance?
- It's just started.
- I too have a partner waiting. Excuse me.
It wasn't his fault,
it was mine. I talk too much.
- Shall we dance?
- It's a polka.
- Don't you like a polka?
- Bit jerky, isn't it?
Like saying goodbye in Morse code.
- I'm sorry.
- There's no need.
- It's terribly hard to explain.
- There's nothing to explain.
You don't expect a girl
to write out a catalogue,
points why I love Mr A
and don't love Mr B.
It's only Mr B who puzzles out
the points against him.
You never saw such an impressive list.
Reasons why Ethne doesn't love John.
- Reason one...
- Don't, John.
I put down about 40. Reason 41 was
"she loves the other man".
- So I crossed the rest out.
- Thank you.
With you to help him,
he'll have a splendid career.
You'll enjoy helping him?
- I hope I shall be able to.
- You will, you'll be very happy.
And I think I shall always love you.
Oh, John, dear...
- I'm so sorry.
- Rubbish, I shall be all right.
You shan't be sorry for anything tonight.
Come and dance that polka.
Faversham?
See what he wants, Lubbock.
He wants to see you privately, sir.
Oh, very well.
Well, Faversham?
I want you to accept this, sir.
- What is it?
- I am resigning my commission.
Resigning your commission?
What do you mean?
I mean just that, sir.
I don't understand.
I should've done this months ago.
I accepted a commission
for my father's sake,
because all his family
have been soldiers.
When he died
my duty towards him was done.
Your duty towards him?!
Have you no duty
towards your country?
Go and lie down in a dark room, my boy.
You'll be all right in the morning.
I've made up my mind, sir.
Faversham, if you do this,
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
I'm sorry, sir, I've made up my mind.
You're shirking your duty, sir!
I refuse to accept your resignation.
I am within my rights to resign,
you cannot refuse.
I never thought I should live to see
a Faversham play the coward.
- May I go, sir?
- Yes. Go.
- The officers...
- Well?!
..are waiting, sir.
Gentlemen, final orders have arrived.
The regiment leaves on Thursday.
We march to Portsmouth
and embark at midday.
I've just received this telegram
from General Kitchener.
"Glad to welcome your regiment
to my command."
- That's very nice, isn't it?
- Gentlemen.
There will be one change
in regimental orders for the 15th.
Mr Faversham has seen fit
to send in his papers
on the eve of his regiment
sailing for active service.
His place will be taken by Mr Parker,
who was to have remained at the depot.
- Congratulations.
- Glad you're coming with us.
- Well, I must be off.
- Goodbye, John.
- Goodbye.
- Good luck to you.
- You'll keep an eye on young Peter?
- I will, sir. Both eyes.
There's a luvvie ducks.
What's she crying for?
There. Well, goodbye, Aggie.
Take care of your ma.
- Goodbye, Fred.
- Goodbye, luvvie. Don't take on, now.
I'm all right. The kids will miss you.
- Goodbye, my boy.
- Goodbye, Father.
- The dogs are going to miss you.
- Yes, sir.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
In the days of auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For the sake of auld lang syne
Harry!
What's happened? Peter left last night,
Father went to see you all off.
It's cancelled? You're not going after all?
They've gone.
The regiment sailed this morning.
- But I haven't gone with them.
- I don't understand.
We've discussed it so often.
The futility of this
idiotic Egyptian adventure,
the madness of it all, the ghastly waste
of time that we can never have again.
- What have you done, Harry?
- I've resigned my commission.
I should've done it sooner, long ago.
It's released me from
the life of an impostor.
That's all a man is if he fails
to be true to his beliefs.
I believe in our happiness,
in the work to be done here
to save an estate from ruin.
To save those people
neglected by my family
because they preferred glory
in India, China and Africa.
Excuse me, miss. This package
has just arrived for Mr Faversham,
addressed in your care
and marked "urgent".
Thank you.
Mr Thomas Willoughby...
Mr Peter Burroughs...
Captain John Durrance.
They had a fine sendoff, Ethne.
I went aboard and had lunch with them
before they sailed.
Peter has a cabin
with Durrance and Willoughby.
I'm glad they're together.
- Father...
- Yes, it was a wonderful sight,
the vessel steaming into the channel
and everyone cheering...
May I speak to you a moment, sir?
It was cruel to send these.
Cruel, but just.
That's what you think, isn't it?
You needn't tell me, Ethne,
I can see it clearly in your eyes.
We agreed always to be honest
with each other, to keep no secrets.
When you did this...
did you believe
that I should be proud of you?
I thought you'd understand.
We've talked of these things and
we've always understood each other.
I know, Harry, we've talked and dreamed
of things we'd do if we were free.
Some people are born free,
they can do as they like
without consequences.
But you were not born free
and nor was I.
We were born into a tradition,
a code we must obey
even if we do not believe.
We must obey because the pride
and happiness of those around us
depends upon our obedience.
I quite understand.
There should be four feathers here.
We agreed always to be honest
with each other.
Give it to me.
Come on!
Brigade! Attention!
Shoulder...arms!
Present...arms!
Shoulder...arms!
- You've served here before.
- Abu Klea, sir.
Then you know what to expect.
- And you too?
- I've been out here ever since, sir.
- Married?
- Yes, sir.
- Children?
- Four, sir. When I left home.
- Harry Faversham?
- Hello, Doctor.
What's happened?
I thought your regiment had gone?
Yes, they've gone.
Like the guards have gone tonight.
Years ago, I gave you my card.
Do you remember?
- Yes, Doctor, I remember.
- In case you ever needed any help.
Come along, we'll have
a quiet supper at my club,
it's just across the park -
the Naval And Military.
No, not there, if you don't mind, Doctor.
- Let's go to my rooms.
- Very well.
You left the army because
your duty to your home
was greater than your duty towards
a crowd of African peasants?
There's nothing dishonourable in that.
If that's all, if that's the whole truth,
these feathers are an insult
to be treated with the contempt
they deserve.
If that were all, I'd have burnt them
and you'd never have known.
But you know that it's not all.
Just as Ethne knew.
I was told a ghastly story
when I was a boy - you were there.
An officer who failed
to carry a message through fear,
an officer disgraced
and hounded out of society,
who shot himself in a back room
because his life was ruined.
That story haunted me.
Many a man is haunted by some fear.
It was more than fear.
My father believed me to be a coward.
His belief turned fear into reality.
I knew if ever put in the same position
I'd behave like that man
and meet the same end.
I am a coward, Doctor.
If I'd not been a soldier,
I might have concealed it all my life.
But to be a soldier and a coward
is to be a menace to the men
whose lives are in your hands.
When orders came for Egypt
I knew fate was closing in round me,
just as it closed round that other man.
I fought against it,
I believed in all the reasons
I gave for shirking my job.
I deceived myself,
but I didn't deceive my friends.
The men who sent me these feathers
knew me better than I knew myself.
The man who tries to cheat fate is
more than a coward, he's a fool as well!
You're wrong there, Harry.
I never met a fool who had
the imagination to be a coward.
If I thought you were a coward,
I should take this with me.
Fight you for it if necessary.
It's because I know you've
no intention of using it on yourself
that I leave it here.
Harry, is there anything I can do?
- Yes, there is something you can do.
- Yes?
I shall be leaving England tomorrow.
I shall write to you from time to time,
just to tell you that I'm alive.
If you don't hear from me for a year...
you'll know that I'm dead.
If that happens,
I'd like you to go to Ethne
and tell her that
at least I tried to put right
the shame and humiliation I caused her.
Can you tell me where you're going?
Egypt.
- Dr Harraz?
- Yes.
I've come from England,
from an old friend of yours - Dr Sutton.
I remember him, I served with him
in the hospital in India. How is he?
- Well. He sends you his greetings.
- What may I do for you?
I need to reach
General Kitchener's army,
I want your help
to disguise me as a native.
- You speak Arabic?
- No.
- You have some native tongue?
- No.
The army is 400 miles away,
across enemy lands.
How then can a doctor help you,
except to certify you as mad?
I know of the Sangali tribe,
who revolted against the Khalifa.
In revenge, the Khalifa cut out
their tongues and branded them.
- You know the brand?
- All men know the brand of the Sangali.
Then you understand why I am here.
You will miss your tongue in many ways.
I will keep my tongue -
no one will look for it if I am branded.
I can stain your skin
but I cannot imitate a scar
that would escape detection.
- That I understand.
- Is your mission of such importance?
May I stay in your house
until the wound has healed?
You are a brave man.
- Ah, Durrance.
- Told to report, sir.
I've spoken to Kitchener.
You know the situation.
The ships must get up the Nile,
it's the only feasible route to Omdurman,
but the Khalifa are blocking the river
and we can't get through the gorge.
The Khalifa must be drawn away
by some sort of bluff, into the desert.
- Yes, sir.
- If a brigade appeared on his flank,
he'd have to face it,
leaving the river unguarded.
Yes, sir.
General Kitchener can't spare a regiment
or a brigade,
but he can spare a company.
Number 5 Company
of the Royal North Surreys.
Thank you, sir.
Number 1 Section, quick march!
- Number 2 Section, quick march!
- Number 3 Section, quick march!
Number 4 Section, quick march!
Who is this man?
How much did he overhear?
Sangali.
That was a very bad performance.
No Sangali would enter a room with
the self-assurance of an Englishman.
- Why was he in such a funk?
- He is terrified of betrayal.
- Oh, I see.
- I have no such fears
but I should be more comfortable
if you'd tell me why all this -
the wandering, the disguise.
In England, four people each gave me a
white feather. They must take them back.
A mad race, the English.
Oh, not so mad.
A white feather is the mark of a coward.
Ah, I see. Then why worry?
Be a coward and be happy.
No, Doctor. I have been a coward
and I wasn't happy.
Did he bring any news?
Yes, the North Surrey Regiment
has left Abu Hamed.
Crossing the desert you could meet
at the Nile, near the 5th Cataract.
Part of the army is going up by boat.
They will be hauled up
the Cataract by native labour.
There is your chance.
- All right, Sergeant?
- All correct, sir.
We've enough scarecrows
to look like the whole army.
That should work, the men can rest.
But the moment we're spotted,
we'll have no time to admire the view.
- No, sir.
- Take the men back to the camp.
Very good, sir.
Your watch, no fuzzies round here.
- I'm gonna have a word with the captain.
- Right ho, Sarge.
Blimey!
Two men! At the double!
Put down your rifles!
Come on, give me a hand.
Shouldn't we start back to camp?
His orders were to stay until we see
dervishes, and we ain't seen none.
- We need ice for the back of his neck.
- And a saucy nurse to slap it on!
- Can you see anything?
- No.
I can't make it out. He said
he'd be back by dawn at the latest.
Perhaps he's spotted
a covey of dervishes.
No, if he had he'd be back in no time.
Kitchener?
- Who's there?
- Corporal Evans, sir.
- How long have I been lying here?
- Since this time yesterday, sir.
- What's the time now?
- About 3 o'clock, sir.
Call Sergeant Brown
the moment it's daylight.
But it's light now, sir, it's afternoon.
What?
- Call Sergeant Brown.
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant Brown, the captain wants you.
- All right.
- Sergeant Brown here, sir.
- Come in, come in.
No sign of dervishes yet, sir.
Strike the camp immediately,
I spotted dervish yesterday.
Very good, sir.
Corporal Clark, call in your men!
Hughes, bring the captain's horse.
Double there.
- Ready to march off, sir.
- Sergeant, come here, don't go away.
- I want you to help me to my horse.
- Very good, sir.
Attention!
Flower and Bardell strike the tent,
put it on the mule and follow behind.
Section at ease, quick march.
Take me to my tent.
Very good, sir.
Glad to see you back, sir.
Spotted a dervish,
so I stayed to keep watch.
They saw us all right,
so that's half our work done.
Sergeant, give the men food
and see they get to sleep.
Willoughby, Parker, put those
fires out and double the sentries.
No immediate danger but
we must keep on alert from now on.
Yes, sir.
- Brown, put your fire out.
- Bill, give us a hand!
Simper, Curtis, Gamble -
bring your equipment.
Peter, I got a touch of the sun
out there yesterday.
Hard luck, old boy. I had sunstroke
when I was a kid at school.
- How did it affect you?
- Gave me a devil of a headache.
You look a bit done in.
You need a good rest.
We're not in a healthy spot here.
Things may get a good deal worse.
I'm feeling groggy,
I'm going in to rest now.
- Will you look after things here tonight?
- Yes, of course.
- Shall I help you in?
- No, I'll be all right in the morning.
- Seen anything?
- No, sir.
- Keep your eyes open.
- Very good, sir.
The mules are restless, sir. A bad sign.
- Yes, I shall be glad when the sun rises.
- Yes, sir.
Alarm!
Alarm! Bugler! Alarm!
Alarm! Alarm!
Alarm!
Alarm!
Fire!
Load! Present! Fire!
Present! Fire!
Fire!
Where are you? Are they all round?
I can't see in this smoke!
Fire!
Load! Present! Fire!
Load! Present! Fire!
Load! Present! Fire!
Load!
Fire!
- Sir, Ali has news.
- Good, what does he know?
The Khalifa's left the Nile with his army.
That's the news we're waiting for.
Give orders to sail at once.
This is grand. Kitchener
can have his battle where he wants it.
Thanks to Durrance.
He's done a magnificent job.
Peter?
Is that you, Peter?
Peter?
Peter? Peter?
Peter!
Willoughby?!
Burroughs!
Peter! For God's sake, answer me!
Oh, is that you, Peter?
I'm blasted near mad!
I...I can't see, Peter.
It's no good pretending any more,
I can't see. I'm blind.
The sun got me out there
in the mountains.
Why don't you speak?
What's the matter?
Who are you?!
What, are you all dumb?
You've never seen a blind man before?
Who the devil are you?!
Speak!
If not English then Arabic
but speak. Speak!
It's true, then.
They're all dead.
All my company wiped out.
Nothing but a blind man
and a dumb lunatic.
There's nothing left but death from thirst.
Come here. Come here!
Lean your head against the one cool
thing left in this blasted furnace.
You won't? All right, well...
go to the devil alone!
Give it to me! Give it to me!
I'll kill you!
Hello! Hello!
Company, stand to!
Company, fall in!
Load! Present! Fire!
Load! Present! Fire!
Fire!
Load! Present! Fire!
Fire!
Load! Present...!
Give me my helmet, Sergeant, will you?
Ethne...
"Don't you like the polka?"
"A bit jerky, isn't it?"
Ethne, I shall love you always.
Hello, Doctor.
I'm glad to find you alone, Ethne.
- I really came here to talk to you.
- Well, doctor?
Have you heard from Harry Faversham?
I've heard nothing.
It was his own wish and my wish
that the break should be complete.
I've no idea where he is
or what he's doing.
I promised to give you a message when
I saw him on the night he left a year ago.
A year ago?
Then... I don't understand, Doctor.
He left England for one purpose only -
if he succeeded he said you would learn
by means that needed no explanation.
If he failed then he asked me to let you
know that at least he'd done his best.
I see.
He promised to write to me
now and then, to show he was still alive.
If I heard nothing for a year then his
silence would show that he was dead.
My dear.
So that's the end.
- You think I behaved brutally, Doctor.
- No.
I did behave brutally.
I behaved like the worst kind of coward.
I failed to help him
when he was terribly in need of help.
Nothing you'd have done
would've altered his decision.
- I could have helped him!
- You could have done nothing.
His mind was made up.
You must always remember that.
For the sake of his memory
and for your own happiness.
Oh, Ethne!
What are you two
mooching about outside for?
Having a dose of
your country air, General.
It'll be bronchitis if you don't take care.
Come on in for some sherry.
Look, an Arab. He's got an officer!
- He's trying to rob him!
- Let's get him!
Abdul, ask him what he has to say.
It is useless, Your Excellency,
he is from the Sangali tribe,
he cannot speak.
Put him with the thieves
and send them to mend the roads.
- March him out, Sergeant.
- Sir.
The doctor, sir.
- Doctor, how's Durrance?
- He'll pull through.
Splendid. The regiment
can't spare a man like that.
He's blind.
Blind?
Sunstroke.
Exposure of the eyes to the sun.
I've seen it before, Colonel.
A man alone lies there exposed.
But with rest he'll get better?
With immediate attention
he might have, but not now.
The nerves are completely destroyed.
Jump!
- Bravo!
- Good work, John, good work.
You'll have me
riding to hounds in a few weeks.
- Up another six inches, Joe.
- Not today.
- Just a tiny bit more.
- Tomorrow. Time to dress for dinner.
Dress?! I can dress in ten minutes now.
- There's your shaving lesson, too, sir.
- Ah, yes.
And my lesson in making bow ties.
Back to school again, Ethne.
- Joe's a great teacher.
- Easy with a good pupil.
And no more chopped up meals - I want
a lesson in carving roast chicken!
See you at dinner. Come on, Joe.
Thank you.
Brave man.
I hope I can make him very happy.
Joe, you do it for me, will you?
Look here, I've been wanting to say
something to you for a long time.
Beastly difficult to know how to put it.
It's no business of mine but
are you sure you're right in doing this?
Quite sure.
A man becomes a soldier
with knowledge of the risks.
If misfortune comes
he doesn't ask for pity or sympathy
but you've got your whole life
before you.
I know it's a noble, unselfish impulse -
but for 30 or 40 years, maybe 50 years!
Please don't talk about being noble,
there's nothing like that about it, just...
Well, it's just that I've made up my mind.
Yes, the Arab is a strange,
unexpected creature.
You haven't heard the end yet.
Here's a solitary Arab,
heaven knows where he comes from.
He packs my map,
slings my water bottle round my neck
and never says a word
from beginning to end.
- That must have been uncanny.
- Uncanny? It nearly drove me mad.
Yet I knew he was trying to save me.
How long we travelled I'll never know -
I was crazy with fever.
He gets me in a boat,
floats me down the Nile
and in sight of the camp -
here's the extraordinary part -
he lays me down outside the camp
and calmly begins to rob me.
Nothing strange in that,
just eastern business mentality.
He'd done a job
and was taking payment.
He got less than he bargained for,
I carry no papers or money.
He got nothing, then?
He only got one thing -
the only thing I was carrying.
- Remember this?
- My letter!
Your letter.
There's a funny thing in this.
Ethne, read the postscript you wrote.
It's still got some sand in it!
Keep the sand as a souvenir.
Thank you.
- Go on, read the postscript.
- Let me.
"P.S. Take care not to get sunstroke."
You always said
I knew too much to take advice.
Darling, I'm sorry, you're trembling.
You mustn't take it like that.
It might have been a lot worse.
I'd have been dead
without my little Arab friend.
And what happened to him?
Wish I knew.
They sent him to a convict gang.
When I came to, he'd escaped
and I was never able to trace him.
Now for a turn in the garden.
Stay here, I'll get my coat.
I'll fetch yours, Ethne.
Oh, my letter.
Thank you.
So Harry's alive,
or was when he paid that debt.
Who is it?
Peter, good of them
to entertain us for nothing.
If I had my hands free I'd applaud.
If I had mine free I'd strangle
that blighter with the monkey.
Willoughby, do I still look sane?
No. Do I?
Don't despair.
Peter...
Peter?
Perhaps our message got through.
Perhaps Durrance got away
and sent this fellow to help.
Escape? I wonder.
I wonder what his plan is?
Karaga.
Karaga Pasha.
Tell me, which do you think
would give the better chance of escape,
the desert or the river?
How should I know?
Nobody has ever escaped from here.
But surely some attempts
must have been made to free you?
Yes, years and years ago.
But they all failed.
How long have you been here?
- Since Gordon was killed.
- 13 years.
- Swim? Swim?
- Yes.
See island?
Tomorrow, boat waiting.
So the mad musician of Omdurman
was a British spy.
What message did you give
to your British friends?
The Khalifa will reward you.
What do you know of Kitchener's army?
Answer or we'll flog you until you do!
Answer!
- There you are.
- Thank heavens.
- That's the end of that.
- No pork for dinner.
Poor devil, they've flogged him.
I wonder who he is.
Looks like an Arab.
Probably paid by our people to help us.
- Has he got any papers on him?
- Spies don't usually.
Well, I made a nice mess of that, didn't I?
Faversham!
Harry, how did you get here?
Who sent you?
- Nobody.
- Then why are you here?
- Explain, Harry.
- No time to explain.
We're in a mess. Now, listen.
The Khalifa has gone to meet Kitchener.
If he's beaten he'll kill us in revenge.
If he wins he'll kill us for pure joy.
Opposite the prison
is the arsenal of the Khalifa,
just a couple of guards and doorkeepers.
- Have you got that file?
- Yes, that was a brainwave!
Does anybody understand
the language of these poor devils?
That fellow over there. I'll fetch him.
- You all right, Harry?
- Yes, I'm all right, Fat-face.
This is Karaga Pasha, once governor
of the province of Kordofan.
You speak the language
of these people?
I speak Arabic and Greek,
they all understand one.
Then will you tell them that I have
brought the means of setting them free?
Tell them not to make a sign or move
until they get the word from me.
We must work very fast.
Break that file in two.
Bring me the strongest man first.
Attention!
Fix...
bayonets!
Attention!
They're deploying to attack.
Their whole army.
Perkins, to the right.
Cranley, to the left.
Take positions and hold fire
till the last possible moment.
- Load!
- Kneel!
- Grand sight, ain't it?
- Horrible close. When do we fire?
When we're told.
If you can't look at 'em comin' on,
shut your eyes,
I'll nudge you when to open 'em.
Present!
Fire! Fire!
- Get your chains off.
- Tell them it's now or never.
They mustn't move
until the guards reach us.
They're rallying again.
- Not so many of them now.
- Nor of us, sir.
Lengthen range 350.
We'll have that tower.
- That's the arsenal.
- Good! Blow it up!
Lengthen range 350!
- That's not a dervish gun.
- They'll blow us to pieces!
Wait here.
They're firing at the black flag! We must
get it down and put something else up!
- This'll do.
- Harry, look! The one they took from us!
- Right, I'll take it.
- Right.
They're lowering the flag - surrendering -
hauling up a white one.
- It isn't white, it's ours!
- What?!
Paper! Khartoum recaptured!
Paper! Paper!
Khartoum recaptured! Paper!
Come in.
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Doctor.
How are you?
Have a drink - on the table there.
- Mind if I light the gas?
- Sorry, old man.
- Give me the matches, I'll light it.
- Heard the news?
I've been listening.
Is it true we've got Khartoum?
Kitchener broke the dervishes
at Omdurman.
Good, good! Splendid.
Well, that's that. Sit down, Doctor.
- Whisky?
- Not just now, John.
You've seen Dr Wesley?
I've just left him. Heine, the German
specialist, was there too.
Nice fellow, took a lot of trouble.
You needn't tell me the verdict,
I quite understand.
I think it's what you expected, John.
- He doesn't feel an operation...
- Neither did I.
A man gets to understand these things.
If there's any spark left inside
that could be fanned up again
I'm certain I should've felt it there.
I've known for some time
that they were stone dead.
Heine explained that
the trouble sometimes comes
from a lesion that can be repaired
by operation. In your case...
In my case it's a complete blackout.
No harm in getting
the best man, anyway.
- You've earned your whisky now.
- Thanks.
Might've been a lot worse.
If I had known from the start
I'd probably have blown my brains out.
But I've been learning to read
this Braille stuff.
Funny how quickly
the fingers get sensitive. Listen...
"Be not afeared, the isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs
"that give delight and hurt not.
"Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears
"and sometimes voices
that if I had then waked after a long sleep
"will make me sleep again,
"and then in dreaming,
the clouds me thought would open
"and show riches ready to drop upon me
"that when I wake I cried to sleep again."
- Splendid.
- Marvellous, isn't it?
I knew that bit by heart anyway.
Here... Here's to your health, doctor.
- And here's to you, John.
- Kitchener and his lads in Khartoum.
Now, stretch out your legs
and read the news.
There's a report by Mallinson,
the war correspondent.
- "Khartoum, 2nd September."
- Good. Do read it.
"From Gordon's Palace
I am proud to send news of victory.
"At dawn, after a night of storms,
"scouts reported the dervish army
massing upon the hills above Kerreri."
That's where the legend said
the British would be destroyed, now if...
- Oh, shut up and listen.
- Sorry.
"At six o'clock
the dervish army advanced
"and flung themselves
at the British squares.
"Within two hours
the dervish forces were in flight.
"A full report will be sent
when details are available.
"I accompanied
the North Surrey regiment..."
- Good old Surreys.
- "..witnessed the most dramatic scene.
"During the battle the prisoners
in the Omdurman dungeons
"captured the arsenal
and held it till relieved."
- Bravo!
- "They were led by two British officers
"captured at Gakdul Wells,
Lieutenants Burroughs and Willoughby."
Peter, alive! And good old Willoughby!
Isn't that splendid?!
- What's the time?
- Just gone seven.
We'll go tonight, we'll be the first
to tell Ethne and the old man!
He'll be crazy with excitement about this!
- Joe! Joe!
- Yes, sir?
Pack my bag!
Get Dr Sutton's bags sent here!
We're going to General Burroughs'.
But I've got
an appointment!
And tell Dr Sutton's man
to cancel all his appointments!
- But they'll already know!
- They don't get the evening papers.
- We'll walk in with the news!
- The War Office will send a telegram.
You've always got some cold-blooded
reason for doing nothing!
Don't you realise what this means?
Peter's alive - and done a grand job, too.
Is there any more?
"..Burroughs and Willoughby,
"whose release was due to an act of
heroism described to me by Burroughs.
"A man posing as a dumb Sangali native
"smuggled in a means of
cutting the chains of the captives.
"He suffered torture
and faced death to do so
"because he was, until recently,
an officer of their own regiment."
Lieutenant Faversham.
Why should he try to rob me?
- Doctor.
- Yes, John?
There's some notepaper on my desk,
I want you to write a letter for me.
- I'm ready, John.
- To Ethne Burroughs.
"Dear Ethne...
"I've just had some splendid news,
"I've been to
a famous German eye doctor...
"and my sight can be restored."
Got that?
I've got that, John.
"It means a long treatment in Germany
and I leave tomorrow.
"When I can see again
I shall return to the army...
"with the happy memory of all you have
done to help me through."
I'll sign it myself.
And add a postscript.
"P.S.
"Just heard the splendid news
of Peter and Willoughby
"and Harry Faversham.
"I enclose a little souvenir
"of a journey through the desert
with a dumb Sangali native.
"If you give him the chance
that he deserves you'll find he's not...
"as mute as I thought he was."
That's all.
Your bags are packed, sir.
There's just time for dinner.
All right, Joe, we're not going after all.
I...
I still say the army of today
is soft compared with our time.
Soft, that's your trouble.
Still, you did your best.
And as Harry's made you
take your feathers back
he'd better marry the girl, eh, doc?
It's not as easy as all that.
There's my feather too.
What deed of reckless daring are you
going to do to make me take it back?
Must I?
Deeds of reckless twaddle!
No such thing nowadays.
All you boys had to do
was deal with fuzzy-wuzzies.
The Crimea was different.
War was war in those days.
No room for weaklings.
Take Balaclava, for instance.
You won't remember the positions...
It was this.
Ah, thank you. Here were the Russians.
Guns, guns, guns.
- On the right, the British infantry...
- One moment, sir.
Your famous account of Balaclava
is not accurate.
- Not...?
- Not accurate, sir.
- Not accurate?!
- No, sir. Let me recall the position.
Out of the way, Peter.
Here are the Russians, behind the
walnuts. Guns, guns, guns.
Here's the British infantry -
the Thin Red Line.
Here's the commander in chief.
And here are you,
at the head of the old 68th.
- Correct?
- Absolutely.
You were riding a horse called Caesar
which my father sold you
because he could never hold him.
Quite right, quite right.
According to your story you said,
"The 68th will move forward."
- Quite right, quite right.
- But you never said it.
- Nev...?
- You never said it, sir.
- Never said it?!
- No, sir, you never had time.
At that moment
my father told me Caesar...
Er, Caesar. Caesar...
..startled by a stray bullet,
dashed straight at the Russian lines.
Away went you, the 68th,
away went everybody!
A magnificent mistake
was added to a magnificent record.
But nobody ever told the 68th
to move forward.
Unless it was the horse
Come on, sir, own up.
Well...after all these years it's
difficult to remember the details but...
Confound it, I shall never be able
to tell that story again!
Ethne, your feather.
