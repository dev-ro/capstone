Sweetie, sit down.
My fellow citizens
we're currently experiencing violent riots in all major cities,
resulting in many civilian and police injuries.
Riots led to shutting down of various districts,
and the rioters have forcibly attempted to destroy
or take government property,
For this reason, we're entering state of emergency,
in order to control current situations.
Thanks to our government's rapid response,
various outbreaks are being contained
Fellow citizens,
please refrain from reacting to baseless rumors,
and stay in the safety of your homes, (KEY WORD: ZOMBIES)
We must stay calm and trust the government,
in order to overcome such trying obstacle.
We believe that your safety is not in jeopardy

I'm with my daughter.
Can you help me and my daughter?
But the thing is...
I'll get you a real scoop, do me a favor.
Don't go to the main square, come to the East one.
I'll let my men know.
Okay, thank you. Thanks so much.
All dead... All dead...

There's nobody.
Why isn't anyone here?
What's going on back there?
This is that violent incident i told you about.
-Your'e the conductor?  -Yes.
How many can fit in the engine car?
We must uncouple it and go to Busan.
-Uncouple? -Yes!
-We can't! -Why not?!
It can't be done here.
Then, where's the Military?
Right...
I only recieved a report about it...
-Where's my business card...
-I'm COO of Stallion Express,
-all routes into Daejeon are cut off.
-our busses are all rerouted
But what for?

They probably won't let us in.
But Busan is still open, let's go there!
-Wait, if that's true...
-We just take others.  -Take Who?!
-Let's check the station first.
Hey!
Dammit!
