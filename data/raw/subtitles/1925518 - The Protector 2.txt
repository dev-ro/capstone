"Conflict between government and
separatists in katana intensifies."
"Death tolls keep rising
from ongoing clashes."
"Rebel leader general dutati
insists on the partition"
"and establishment of west katana."
"The UN and four southeast Asian nations
offer to serve as mediators."
"Peace talk has begun, the two sides
reach a cease fire agreement."
"Peace is a real possibility now as the
final meeting takes place in Thailand."
"But not everyone wants peace."
"Bangkok, Thailand."
Kham!
What're you doing?
Easy, man.
Put the knife down and
tell me what you want!
I already did! But you didn't listen!
Sarge, back off!
I won't until you put that knife away!
It's too late, sarge, I've got no choice!
Kham! No!
"Tom yum goong 2"
"surin, Thailand"
let's learn a bit about "khock hasarn".
First position, do you know what this is?
Elephant's tusks...
And what is this?
Elephant's trunk...
We call this move an
elephant twisting the grass.
How about this?
Ear...
An elephant flapping his
ears, five times together.
One, two, three, four, five.
Kham, you only teach us the dance moves.
What if someone punches us?
Mud, come here, you're so curious, huh?
You don't trust me?
Not really. Let's try this.
Which part of khon is the
strongest and scariest?
His tusks.
Correct.
The khodchasarn principle relies
on using the body's strongest parts.
Use the elbows to block a
strike and counter-attack!
Hit me.
Right here.
Now, the elephant twists its trunk!
Mud, go home now!
How many times have I told you
not to practice this stupid boxing!
Why don't you do your homework?
I really want to know
if this jaturong art can beat my cane?
Kham!
How many times have I told you
not to take your elephant to the market!
Look at the mess he's made!
If you want to keep an elephant,
go live in the jungle!
Mud, go home now, quick!
Kham! I have something to show you!
Come here!
I'll tell the Abbot about your pranks,
and you'll have to find
a new place to live!
No! Please don't tell him!
Lord Buddha said not to
believe until there's proof.
So we have to experiment, right?
Wait... kham! One more thing.
My foot!
Let's go.
Kham!
Let's go.
Remember, stay hungry, stay foolish...
He's here.
Please.
Look sir, this elephant
has divine features.
It has descended
from a long line ot the finest pedigree.
- His ancestor...
- That's enough!
Take the money and bring
him the paper, now!
You touch, I kick.
Don't play hard to get,
just name your price.
Only fools think money can buy everything.
Watch your mouth!
This guy talks just like the
witch I banged last night.
"You can't buy me!"
Then what? She was in
the shower when I left.
Boss is really interested,
you don't make easy money
like this every day.
Your elephant will get
to live in a real camp.
You can't even take good care of your self
around this backwoods!
Pride has its price too.
I'll ask you one last time, how much?
As much as you'd pay for your mom and dad.
Kham!
My dad's got the coconuts for you!
I'm here to do business.
I'm not forcing you to sell it.
Even though I can.
Leave him the phone number.
I can't believe this. You're
dumber than your beast!
You could've made a fortune!
Kham! What happened?
Nothing.
Good that you're here, watch khon for me.
I'll be back.
Back when?
Rangen have found a carcass
of a male elephant,
40 years old, weighing 2 tons.
It lied in a crouching position, face down.
All four legs bent back.
Its face was sliced off
from the eyes to the mouth.
Most conspicuously, the tusks were cut off
as well as the tip of the tail.
There's also a 1-centimeter-wide
bullet hole near the mouth.
It's in the paper today,
and they've done it again!
The beast has been killed for 2 to 3 days.
It's clear that the elephant scampered
through the forest for 100 meter.
"One shot dead, elephant poachers
in gun fight with rangers."
Piak, pond, thanks!
Job!
Kham! They took khon!
"Suchart vilawandei."
Mr. vinii, sir. Is this line secured?
Are you alone?
Go on, sir.
Have you delivered the package?
It's done, sir. But I'm curious.
We have plenty ot elephants.
Why do they want this one?
The better question is,
what will they do with it?
It's best that you don't know.
Our job is done.
From now on, we no longer know each other.
My advice is you should disappear.
Sir...
Where is suchart?
Second floor.
Uncle!
Uncle...
Wait!
I didn't kill him.
Catch him!
Ping-ping!
Freeze!
Sergeant mah!
Kham!
Are you all right?
Of course not!
Let me help you.
Call the ambulance!
Is that him?
I'm not sure. It happened so fast.
This hurts!
There are no cameras inside the house.
But the evidence is substantial.
Right.
You see this?
Of course, I'm not blind.
The victim was hit by a
hard object at three spots.
Hard object? Like what?
Like a fists.
Are you saying he was struck to death?
The killer must be a pro.
A martial artist.
That's why he drew blood from your head!
Lucky that you survived!
But anyway we would like to thank you
for tipping us off with
the leads from interpol.
You also attempted an
arrest of the suspect!
Are you mocking me?
You boys were running around like dud.
I helped you out of mercy!
Take it easy, we're thankful
you're here to help us.
Please get his phone.
Find me on the number
he had been calling these last few months.
I also need all the flies
and documents from this room.
Every hard drive from the computers,
and don't forget the cameras.
Interpol will handle it from now on.
Come on lc, I want to fight with no.2.
What the heck is this?
Rank 31 want to fight with no.2?
That's dam suicide.
Let me see you handle her first, all right?
Then we'll talk.
Come on lc. Don't tell me
she's higher rank than me.
"Twenty."
B-r-a-v-o
you, my dear are one beautiful
butt kicking machine.
Lc, will I get to fight with 02?
Stop!
Round 1 has already begun.
Why are you here?
That's exactly my question,
why are you here?
And why were you at suchart's house?
I'm just looking for khon.
Looking for khon?
You've lost your elephant again?
You're sure it's an
elephant and not a kitten?
Why do you keep losing him?
Listen, sarge.
Suchart and his men went
to my house to buy khon.
I refused.
When he left, khon disappeared.
So you went to his house to kill him.
You talk as if you didn't know me.
Because I know you.
I know how you can raise!
I also know you're naive,
that's why I haven't arrested you.
Stop right there!
If you don't want to help,
don't stand in my way.
To you, khon may be just an elephant.
But to me, he's my younger brother.
Your dad slept with an elephant?
Sarge!
Hands off!
Now!
I don't want this to happen,
but I have something to tell you.
Tomorrow, the ruler of the Republic
ot katana will visit Thailand.
There's a terrorist's plot against him,
that's why I'm here!
And I've found you here,
where I didn't expect you to be!
Kham.
I can help you if you trust me.
Tell me the truth.
What truth? I told you I know nothing!
Pixie girls, easy!
I should've filmed those little fuckers.
You mean when...
You about to kill them all one by one.
Or when they had your dam legs
spread open and raping you.
Seems somebody here
having a hard time forgetting the past.
But I'll never forget the
person who saved me.
Thank you for teaching me everything.
I owe you everything, lc.
Hold it!
No.2.
Take no.24 with you
and bring that idiot elephant
boy back here to me.
"To kham: 3 P.M. at the shipyard.
From mark."
Who are you? Let me go!
Let's move.
Hi, I'm not available at the moment,
please leave a message...
Hi, I'm not available at the moment,
please leave a message...
Stop!
I didn't kill him!
Man, that's it? That's all you get, baby?
What's the heck is that?
Yes, sir.
Got it.
Gentlemen, it's been confirmed.
The plane will land in about two hours
and we are the first one
who's got to be there.
Hey guys, I got the file. Come take a look.
This is the footage from five years ago.
It's the same guy from the suchart's cctv.
I've seen this. The guy is a legend.
Wait.
The next one's more interesting.
It's the news from 5 year ago also.
Do you still remember it?
Mean while Asia channel
has descending broadcast a secret tape
that senior sergeant mah
illegally released the thai convict.
So could it just be
that mark let this guy go on purpose?
Where is mark?
Why do I have to baby sit this idiot?
They told me to get rid of him.
Let me eat first!
Damn! Me again? This stupid
is ruining my lunch!
I should cut off your ear as a side dish.
Stop petting him and just
stab the prick in the neck!
Damn!
Who are you? Why did you kill my Uncle?
Cool it, pixie girl!
I ask why did you kill him?
"Interpol international police."
You don't look like an interpol.
Get lieutenant Kong.
He'll be here shortly. And who's that girl?
Family of the victim.
Will you let us in? My face hurts!
As you can see...
He was killed by three extreme
impacts successively at three spots.
First, the cartilage.
The blow forced the victim to bend forward.
When he did that, the
second blow struck his neck
and ruptured his windpipe.
By reflex, he lowered his head
as the murderer landed the final blow
at the top ot his head.
The nerve center of the body.
In short, the person who
did this is a real pro.
I'm sleepy, see you later.
Turn off the light when you leave.
I'm not your janitor.
Excuse me, we're interpol.
We need your cooperation.
Mark! Boys get him!
Thank you.
Take good care of khon.
Remember that he's an auspicious elephant
of the akaneepong clan.
Promise me.
You'll take care of him
as it he were your own brother.
Don't worry. I'll protect him with my life.
Mr. kham!
So nice to finally meet you.
I'm a big fan of your work.
Especially what you did
down there in Sydney.
Superb!
But I must admitted I'm pretty disappointed
with your last five year.
You've been living like a country boy,
eating sugarcane.
That's not a proper life
for a man of your skills.
So I decided to give you a job here
in my organization.
You'll get a lot of money.
A lot of pussy.
And all the coconut you can eat.
What do you say, Mr. kham?
Join us.
I'll take that as a no.
I think you need some persuasion.
Bring him out!
Kham...
Job!
You join us, or he dies?
I'll count to three.
One!
Two!
Wait...
Too slow, man!
Martial art's supposed to be fast!
Don't worry.
I'll give you another
chance to play this game.
For my next surprise!
Khon!
Let me go!
Hey, it's not working...
Get up!
Kham!
Stay hungry, stay foolish!
You told me you keep this number
for the best fighter!
He is the best!
20? What are you doing here?
You're lc's girl. You
gonna get me in trouble.
Then why don't you just kill him?
What are you talking about?
You know I won't do this for free.
There's a price to pay.
Take me away from here.
I know you can do it.
Do you believe in love?
Yes.
But I don't!
There're four electrical shocken
on the legs of your elephant.
The elephant's senses
are far more sensitive than human's.
So he'll feel a lot more pain.
Once you complete the task,
we'll release all the
shackles from the legs.
But it you play any trick,
your elephant dies.
If you pull my leg again,
your elephant is darn dead.
Where are we going?
We're actually looking
your friend, Mr. kham.
We found out that he's received
a huge amount of money in his bank account.
Like you were saying, boss,
we've just received these photos.
They were taken a few months back.
You see this guy?
Up front he runs an organizing company
that works for the government.
At the same time, he's
a funder for suchart.
I'm not so sure what their plan is.
But one thing I know for
sure, he's the next target.
Really?
Our undercover got so close
to find the evidence.
But then we lost the communication.
And to be honest, we're not
sure it he's still alive.
So, let's try to catch this guy first
and then we can find out
who actually hired him.
He's here. He making his way
to the victim on the top floor right now!
Copy that. Okay, Ben, step on it.
Yes, boss.
Kham! What're you doing?
Put the knife down!
Kham! Listen to me! Put it down!
Tell me what you want!
I already did, but you wouldn't listen!
Back off, sarge!
I won't until you put that knife away!
It's too late, sarge, I've got no choice!
Kham! No!
Wait! Can't we talk first?
Tell me what you know.
I will! Don't hurt me!
Boss told me the police
wouldn't let you get out of here alive.
They wanted me to make sure you're dead.
That's all I know, okay?
You never planned to return khon to me!
Where's my elephant?
What else? Spill it! Tell me!
All right, I'll tell you everything!
This is not the guy.
Pick him up and get him out of here.
Okay, mark.
I believe that this is your.
The badge and a ticket.
The flight is tomorrow
morning directly to Sydney.
I want you out of here.
Let the thai police do
their job, all right?
Thanks.
Come out, they're gone.
Sarge, will you help me?
What happened to you?
This isn't worth it! I lost
plenty of men from this darn!
Take it or leave it.
Let's go!
You've brought nothing but trouble!
Were we brother in our past lives?
I have to keep saving your
butt, time after time!
Slowly.
Wipe your blood with this.
Something told me from the
start you didn't do it.
Why do you want to help me all of a sudden?
Are you done with your job?
My job is over.
Along with my career.
Darn it. I'll help you find your elephant.
Maybe I'll feel worthy of something.
That guy you beat up by the pool,
what did he tell you?
They said the gang would
move khon to Phuket tonight.
Phuket? General dutafi,
President of the newly established
county of west katana
will begin his official
visit in Bangkok tonight.
After 10 years of negotiation
between the katana government
and the separatist insurgency.
The war between the two sides is now over.
East katana has asked Thailand
to prepare an elephant banquet in Phuket.
An elephant will be presented
as a gift off goodwill to west katana.
Where have they gone?
That means my job isn't finished.
The problem is...
You're still wanted by the police.
Now you can fly.
Lc, good to see you.
General.
Good seeing you.
Mr. vice president. It's an honor, sir.
Gentlemen, please.
Lc, is this a little much?
Last time we played, I
lost a black hawk to you.
This time I plan to win something back.
Well I gotta tell you, you
better get your f16 ready.
Listen, is it really
necessary for me to be here?
You sure we're not gonna get caught, right?
Watching the game of football at home
and actually watching it in the stadium
ain't the same thing.
Is it lc?
Mr. vice president,
we got the best view in the county
and as far as your safety concern,
client that introduced us
practically guaranteed that.
Good service
and very good selling point.
Gentlemen, to business
and to the war.
I don't want to split the county.
I want the whole county.
Hey, look who it is?
Hey mark.
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.
I got some leads.
Step aside.
Today is a special day,
a peaceful day for both sides.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is with immense pleasure
that we welcome to the stage
of both east and west katana.
Gentlemen, this is once in a lifetime.
You ain't get away twice.
Jaturongkabaat.
The fighter using this style.
Much use every part of his body.
And must strike every
blow hard and powerful.
Must have good eyes...
Recognize the opponent weak spot.
And also strike the vital are such as
the throat, the presses, the joints.
Basically fierce as a lion
and strong as an elephant.
My friends. You are witnessing the most
power and greatest technique ever to exist.
They'll disappear forever.
Is there anything I should know about?
Every is fine general, just fine.
You know I don't like suprises.
Only surprise here today
is the jaturongkabaat.
Mr. kham.
You became a pain in my ass over
your fucking little elephant.
Who would suspect that your poor
little elephant could be turn into a bomb.
Strike him as fast as you can.
Hit him high, hit him low.
Block and attack at the same
time, but don't be struck back.
You do and you're finish.
Shut your blind ass up.
Shut my ass up.
And now to the highlight of this event.
We would like to invite the leader
of both east and west katana.
To place flower on the
elephant as a symbol of peace.
Mark, mark, there's a bomb.
Damn.
Stop them.
Stop them! Now!
Please.
Please trust me.
There's a bomb, a bomb.
Quick, this way.
Over here, hurry.
Mark.
Let's go.
Go stop it.
I don't know.
We're dead.
Remove it.
There's nothing I can do to
stop the bomb from going off.
Don't be scare.
Leave it together.
Sargent, what should we do.
This bomb will be blow if we pull it out.
Stay still.
Lc, listen.
We have to get out of here.
Listen to me just once.
No.
This is your first move
you taught me remember.
I got my revenge because you help me.
And I'm not gonna let you die.
We lost.
I love you.
And I would die for you.
But I will never fucking lose.
Because I don't lose.
Be careful.
Now what.
Back up.
Kham, let me take care of this.
I'll.
Kham.
Kham.
