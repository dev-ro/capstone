I'm thinking of going in there.
Let me see.
[laughing]
I'm lucky.
[indistinct chatter]
[laughing]
What is it?
[chuckling]
- You do? - We can't.. Keep behind. Okay?
You know,
you would think of that..
It's three days and 300..
[indistinct chatter]
[bird cawing]
I'm lucky. Come on.
- My feet are killing me.
- It's your shoes.
- They're worth 200 bucks.
- I told you to break 'em in.
How much longer?
About, three, four hours.
Okay, let's take a break.
[birds chirping]
[Alice chuckling]
How you doin', city girl?
Say nothin', country girl.
[sighs]
- I'm really glad you came.
- Yeah, me too.
[instrumental music]
[grunts]
[exhales]
- Are we lost?
- No.
Are we going
the right direction?
I mean, I haven't been there
since I was a kid.
That way.
[sighing]
Come on.
Christ. It's the blind
leading the blind.

[Matt sighs]
Why don't we pitch camp here?
We'll find the lake
in the morning.
Great.
[sighing]
[rock music]
How do you..
- So you put that into here..
- Okay.
Ah-huh!
It's looking like a tent.
♪ I've been playin'
downtown.. ♪
- Matt, you havin' trouble?
- I've got it.
You got it? You sure?
♪ Just a piece of the pie
God help me ♪
♪ I'm different
♪ I try to fix it
I think we did it.
♪ I hide it
♪ My secret
♪ He said she said was gonna
eat you alive ♪
♪ I got you now baby
♪ You're just what I need.. ♪
[laughing]
- Oh, yeah.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Get this party started.
Here's to adventure.
Here's to no more classes.
No more gross chem with Calvin.
- Or bio with Lambert.
- Oh, Lambert was the worst.
Oh, Brie and I bonded
in that class.
Thank God. I never would've
passed without you.
[laughs]
Neuro kicked my ass.
I liked Neuro.
You would, Hartman.
Fuck you, Marshall.
So you guys are all going
to be doctors, huh?
Yup. Cardiology, like my pops.
Pediatrics.
Family medicine.
Urology.
Urology?
Matt's going to be
a penis doctor.
- Shut up, dude.
- He likes the D.
Fuck you, man.
[laughing]
You guys can laugh all you want.
Starting salary, 400K a year.
Are you going to be
making that much?
Uh, nope.
I will not be making any money
in epidemiology.
Oh, damn, I have to find me
a penis doctor.
Hey!
[laughing]
So how did you two meet anyway?
Um, we met at The Rabbit Hole.
Ugh, God.
Alice, what were you
doing in that dump?
Ugh!
- Lookin' for cheap sex.
- And I found it.
We've been together ever since.
Why epidemiology, Alice?
I mean, I had you pegged
for a surgeon.
It's fascinating.
Well, to me, anyway.
You know, making
the initial discoveries.
Being the first one there.
Ebola.
Mad cow disease.
I guess I kinda feel like
a detective.
You know, like a disease
detective or something.
I don't know.
Well, I think
you're gonna be great.
Thank you.
And don't worry,
I'll support us.
You are a history major.
Right. We're fucked.
[laughing]
[distant howling]
What was that?
A dog?
That's a big dog.
- Sounded like a coyote.
- Coyote? Are you serious?
Yeah. There's lots a
wildlife out here.
Wolves, foxes, deer, bear.
I mean..
Don't worry, baby.
They're just stupid animals.
They're a lot more afraid
of us than we are of them.
I don't care, as long as they
stay far away from me.
They might want their fur back.
[chuckles]
[laughing]
Ha-ha.
I'm going to bed. Goodnight.
- Shit.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Your girlfriend has a big mouth.
Mm-hmm.
- Sorry.
- It's fine.
Yeah. Sorry.
[laughs]
So, were you and Brienne..
- Brie?
- Yeah, if you..
[laughs]
No, we're just friends. Why?
I'm just wondering
how many of these campers
you've actually slept with.
Tsk.
Whoa.
- Pot calling the kettle black?
- Okay.
What's wrong?
I'm thinking, Jules.
Is that illegal?
Is it, is it
about your dad again?
Yeah, so what?
I think it's just..
You're an adult.
It's your life, right?
You can do whatever
you want, just tell him --
You don't get it.
Uh, if he loves you,
he's gonna understand.
It's not that simple, Jules.
Okay, I come
from the Bible Belt.
It's a little bit different
than the Big Apple.
Ignorance is no excuse.
He's not ignorant.
He just wouldn't understand.
- He'd freak out.
- That's his problem.
No.. No, it's not, okay?
It's -- it's mine.
And my dad is everything to me.
My mom is dead.
I'm all he's got.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
I get it.
I'm here for you, for,
you know, whatever you need.
Yeah?
Yeah, babe.
- Are you happy now?
- What?
You were determined
to ruin this weekend for me
no matter what.
That's not true.
I came, didn't I?
Oh, Christ.
It's always about you.
I don't know why I put up
with this shit sometimes.
Maybe you'd rather
be with Alice.
No, she's a lesbian now.
What do you think about her?
Jules? I like her.
But still, she doesn't seem
like Alice's type.
Well, she makes Alice happy
and that's all that matters.
I mean, it's still kinda weird.
I mean, one minute
Alice is straight
the next minute she's gay.
Alice is 100 percent gay.
But how do you know?
She's my best friend.
I.. I just know.
I mean, come on.
She slept with Jesse.
Okay, Jesse was just there.
They were friends.
She was... experimenting.
I think he still likes her.
Well, Jesse always wants
what he can't have.
What's this?
Open it.
Matt.
I know we said that
that we were going to wait
until we graduate, but..
[sighs]
I..
I know it's, um..
It's not that big.
No, babe, it's..
It's perfect.
Sorry, I just,
I wasn't expecting this.
I love you,
Matthew Tyler Hartman.
[instrumental music]
Um, I'll be right back,
all right?
Where're you going?
Uh, nature calls.

Hey, Matt?
Hey, babe?
Baby?
Matt?
Babe?

[growling]
[Brienne screams]
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
- Who was that?
- I don't know.
- It sounded like Brie.
- Brie? What..
- Where the hell are they?
- Aah!
Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God. What was that?
- I don't know.
- Shit! Who's this?
- Who..
- Shit!
- Brie!
Fuck!
What happened to her?
She's alive.
We need to get her
to the hospital.
Get her to the hospital?
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere!
Well, there has to be
a ranger station
around here, right?
I don't know!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. What happened?
Oh, my God.
Looks like an animal
got to her or something.
Hey, Brie. Brie, Brie,
Brie, Brie, Brie.
Can you hear me?
Oh, my God.
Is she dead?
[dramatic music]
Oh, my God!
[both whimpering]
[retching]
Slowly. Okay.
- Okay. Here we go.
- Okay.
Brie? Brie?
- Okay.
- Here.
Okay.
Come on.
Oh, shit.
[crying]
I think Matt has some medical
supplies in his backpack.
What're you gonna do? Put some
fuckin' Band-Aids on her?
We have to do something.
Do you want to just let her die?
Go get the supplies, please.
Hey, Brie.
I'm right here, okay?
I'm not gonna leave you.
What if whatever did this
is still out there?
And what if it comes back?
Fuck!
Hey.
She doing okay?
Look, I'm just gonna
stay with her all night
so you just go sleep in Matt
and Brie's tent tonight, okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Jesse, I'm scared.
It'll be okay.
Promise?
Promise.
Can you hold me?
[instrumental music]
[flies buzzing]
[birds cawing]
[flies buzzing]
[bones cracking]
[birds chirping]
How far is it?
Just up the wash.
Anyone else hurt?
Can everybody walk?
Let me get this straight.
Where exactly were you heading?
Some lake.
[indistinct]
Why'd do you stop here though?
Well, Matt got us lost.
Who's this?
Alice, this is Bill Talbot.
He's got a cabin nearby.
I heard about your friend.
I'm sorry for your loss.
How is she?
She's stable.
I have medical supplies.
Food, water.
So we can take her
to your cabin.
The sooner the better, I'd say.
Hey, uh, do you -- do you have
phone service here?
Not out here, sweetie.
Solitude is my neighbor.
Shit.
Well, there..
I mean, there has to be like
a ranger station, right?
I moved out here six years ago
to get away from all that.
Get away from people.
Nearest human being
is 50 miles away.
I mean,
you know this forest, do..
Do you know what,
what did this to her?
A bear, maybe.
God!
All right, sweetie.
We're here.
Let's get her inside.
[birds cawing]
Somebody needs to hike back
and get some help.
I'll go. But I should go
with somebody.
I-I need to stay with Brie.
I.. I can go.
Okay, fine. Uh, what's
the quickest way back?
Well, down that trail
right there
it's 20 miles to a service road.
Once you're on that, it'll take
you directly to the parking lot.
All right.
If we manage four miles an hour
we should get back
before sundown.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
Jesse, wait.
- Hurry back, okay?
- Take care of yourself too.
Stay on the trail.
[instrumental music]
Just try and keep up, okay?
[panting]
It's so beautiful.
[sobbing]
We were gonna be married.
Honey, I'm so sorry.
[sobbing]
I don't want to live anymore.
No. No, no, no.
Don't, don't say that.
I don't.
I don't understand. I..
He was..
He was right here.
Maybe, maybe a wild animal
dragged him off or something?
No, no, no.
A bear usually leaves
the carcass
comes back to it.
Mountain lion might drag it off
and hide it, but..
He didn't just get up
and walk away.
[intense music]
[birds cawing]
Hey, do you think we're close?
Hey!
Jesse.
[panting]
How is she?
I don't -- I don't know.
You need to come see
for yourself.
What the hell?
That's weird.
It's disgusting.
What, you never seen
a dead animal before?
Only on your girlfriend.
Very funny.
Why would anyone do this?
Why're you asking me?
You know, you're Mr. Outdoors,
aren't you?
Does it look like
I would hang a dead rabbit
from a fucking tree?
You don't like me very much,
do you?
- Honestly, no.
- Why?
- Why? Be -- because of Alice?
- Yeah, that is why.
She's gay, dude.
All right, you've got
to get over that.
Well, that's just
fucking bullshit, okay?
I know her.
She's just going through some
some crazy dyke phase.
- Excuse me?
- You fuckin' heard me.
Yo, fuck you.
[screaming]
Oh, my God!
God, I'm so sorry.
[Jesse screaming]
Oh, fuck!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Fuck! Get it off me.
Shit.
Shit! Are you okay?
Fuck, no. My fucking
foot is in this bear trap.
Okay. All right.
Goddammit!
[screaming]
Fuck!
It fuckin' hurts.
It's fuckin'..
What the fuck is this thing?
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Get it off of me.
- Ready? Ready?
- Okay, one..
- One..
- One..
Two.. Three!
[Jesse grunting]
- Oh, my God!
- Three!
[both grunting]
[screams]
[sighs]
How is she?
Uh, she's sleeping right now.
Is she gonna make it?
I don't know.
[sighs]
You look exhausted.
I'm fine.
Is this your wife?
That's my wife.
Was.
She passed a while back.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
I got a lotta
good memories up here.
Yeah, it's a real Disney World.
[both grunting]
- Fuck! Oh!
- Ah!
One more time. One more time.
- Okay, one more time.
- Fuck, it hurts!
- Ready?
- Shit!
Shit. Okay.
- Fuck you.
- Ready?
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- One, two..
- Three!
- Three!
[both grunting]
- Fucking hurts.
- Ah!
- Stop!
- All right!
Ready? I'm gonna try
one more time.
- One more time.
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Go get help.
- I'll try again.
- I'm gonna try again. Okay?
- You gotta go. No.
- You gotta go back.
- I'm gonna try one more time.
You got to go back
and you gotta get help.
You got to fuckin' go back
and get help.
Okay.
Okay.
Um..
Just, just don't move.
[sighing]
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
[Jesse crying]
Shit!
[breathing heavily]
Alice?
Yeah?
I didn't mean
what I said before.
I don't wanna die.
[sniffling]
Am I going to die, Alice?
You are not gonna die.
Okay?
[dramatic music]
Sun's setting.
Do you think they made it back
to the cars by now?
They should have.
Good. I want to go home.
How's she doing?
It's spreading more rapidly now.
She's dying.
What?
Nothin'.
I'm gonna turn in for the night.
There's blankets in the back.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Get some rest.
Thank you.
I don't trust him.
[door closes]
Why?
I don't know. I..
I just don't trust him.
[exhales]
We should..
We should check on Brie
every couple hours.
Let's just take shifts sleeping.
I'm wide awake,
so you should get some shut-eye.
Yeah?
Yeah, you need it.
[sighing]
[sighs]
I wish I was strong like you.
[scoffs]
I'm not strong.
Yeah, you are.
I'm not strong.
[Jesse grunting]
[chain rattling]
[grunting]
Fuck!
[crickets chirping]
Seriously?
[sighs]
Why?
[birds screeching]
[twigs snapping]
[growling]
It's okay.
[growling]
[exhales]
Please don't be a coyote.
Please don't be a coyote.

[footsteps]
Hey!
Alice?
What're you doing?
I'm just..
I'm just checkin' on her.
- What is that?
- This?
This is, uh, antibiotics.
I thought it might help.
Bullshit!
- What's in the syringe?
- What's going on?
- Trust me.
- I don't trust you.
[gun cocks]
You back the fuck off!
Now!
I have no choice.
- I have to do this.
- Aah!
[gunshot]
[grunting]
[birds cawing]
Jesus. Alice, I can't believe
you fucking shot him.
He'll live.
What do you think
he was doing in there?
I don't know.
I'm gonna find out
when he wakes up.
[coughs]
[distant shrieking]
What was that?
[growling]
I'm gonna go outside.
No, you can't
leave me in here alone.
Just keep an eye on him.
I don't know what to do
with this.
Gina.. Business end.
The trigger.
- It's really easy.
- Okay.
What do I do if he wakes up?
You shoot him in the leg, Gina.
I'll be right back.
[groans]
[laughing]
You..
What, are you gonna shoot me?
You have no idea.
You don't understand
what's coming.
Your friend has been infected
with the virus.
It's taken over her body.
She'll die soon.
And she's gonna turn
into something.
- Something that's not your friend.
- What?
- Something terrible.
- What are you talking about?
You've gotta go in there
and kill her.
- What?
- Our lives are in danger.
You gotta go in there
and put a bullet in her head.
- Shut up!
- You gotta go do this!
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Go in there --
- You gotta go there and do this!
- Shut up!
[gunshot]
[gasps]
[whimpering]
[gasping]
Ah!
[grunts]
[gun cocks]
[exhaling deeply]
Why didn't you shoot him?
I don't think he's
coming back anytime soon.
He said Brienne was dangerous.
He's crazy, Gina.
What are you doing?
- Looking.
- For what?
I don't know.
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
[metal clinking]
[thudding]
I think something's down here.
[grunts]
- Okay.
- Can -- can you move that?
[grunts]
[dramatic music]
Where does that go?
Only one way to find out.
[grunting]
What the fuck?
It's like a cellar or something.
Hand me that lantern.
- I'm gonna go down.
- There's no way I'm going down there.
Suit yourself.
Hey, wait up.
[floorboard creaking]
It's really dark down here.
Jesus Christ. What is this?
I don't know.
What do you think?
I think Talbot's not
what he seems.
Jesus. You think he's like
a serial killer?
"Ketamine?"
This is horse tranquilizer.
Oh, we use this on our mares.
There's about enough
to knock out a dozen here.
Yeah, well..
Something tells me he's not
playing My Little Pony.
I think he kept
someone prisoner here.
By the looks of it,
for a really long time.
What is this?
[knocking on door]
[knocking on door]
Is it Talbot?
Where's the gun?
Oh, shit!
[pounding on door]
Who is it? Answer me!
[pounding continues]
Please just open
the fucking door!
Jules?
- I almost shot you.
- Oh, my God.
Hey, hey..
What are you doing.. What..
Where's Jesse?
Oh, my God, Alice,
it's really bad.
- It's really fucking bad!
- Hey-hey-hey.
Calm down. What happened?
Where's Jesse?
[growling]
Hm?
[growling]
Hello?
[leaves rustling]
[growling]
What the fuck?
[growling]
Oh, shit!
[intense music]
[growling]
Matt?
Oh, my God.
[growling]
[groaning]
[groaning]
[screaming]
[screaming]
What do we do now?
Okay, look,
we wait until the morning.
No, we can't wait until morning.
Jesse could die out there.
It's not gonna help anybody
if the rescue team gets lost
or if it runs into the thing
that she's talking about.
Okay.
Jules, you can take me there.
Gina, you stay with Brie.
[intense music]
[grunts]
Hey, we should be back
before dark.
- Okay?
- Okay.
And then what?
We'll stay the night.
And I'll hike up to the cars
in the morning.
Then I'll drive and get help.
And we'll get the hell
out of here.
- Okay.
- We'll be right back.
[grunts]
[dramatic music]
We're gonna get outta this
together, okay?
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
[groaning]
[gasping]
- He's right there.
- What?
Jesse! I got Alice.
Is he okay? Jesse.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God.
It looks like he got attacked
by a wild animal.
- Alice, this is my fault!
- No. No, it is not.
It is not your fault.
I pushed him.
I shouldn't have pushed him.
It was an accident, Jules, okay?
Okay?
- He's not dead.
- What?
Wait, wait, what?
I mean, he's not breathing,
but he has a faint pulse.
We need to get him back
to the cabin.
Yeah -- yeah, but, um,
how do we get this thing off?
I tried and it's,
it's too freakin' strong.
That's why I brought these.
Where did you get those?
Swiped them from the cabin.
How do you know how to do this?
I used to set traps with my dad.
Nothing this big though.
You scare me sometimes.
Ah, it's working.
[panting]
- Don't go so fast.
- Okay, okay, I'll slow down.
Be careful.
Wait, wait, wait.
- I need a break.
- Okay.
- Right here, right here.
- Okay.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
[grunts]
Oh, my..
[sighs]
Ah.
You'd be a good doctor.
Yeah? Why's that?
I don't know, you're just..
You're wired to save things.
You know, you're just..
I bet you were the type of kid
that saved kittens.
[chuckles]
Yeah.
Ah! It's funny coming
from a family of hunters.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean, when I was little,
my dad held the moon, you know?
And he was a hunter, so I guess
I wanted to be a hunter too.
And he was an army ranger
and he was really
weird about his guns,
he'd never let me hold them.
And I remember, one day
after begging him so much
he finally gave in.
He showed me
how to hold the weapon.
How to aim it.
That day I shot my first rabbit.
Ew, that's, that's gross.
No, I was excited.
A hunter like my dad.
Except that..
...my rabbit was still alive.
That's terrible.
I'll never forget the look
on its face.
I think after that
I gave up hunting
and I, uh, took on soccer.
[scoffs]
And girls.
And girls.
I think I'm gonna go
and see my dad when we get back.
I owe him the truth, you know?
[instrumental music]
[birds chirping]
Brienne settled in.
How's he doing?
I don't know.
His whole body seems to be
in some sorta deep sleep.
Like a coma.
I mean, his heart rate's
barely there.
He's not responsive to light.
He could be brain-dead
for all I know.
Well, you're the expert
on viruses
so what are we
dealing with here?
Well, I'm not an expert.
But this virus, it appears
to be transmitted by a scratch
or a bite of an infected animal.
We have to get them
to the hospital.
We can't go now,
it's about to be dark.
We'll wait until the morning.
[instrumental music]
I'm gonna stay with Jesse.
Yeah.
[sighs]
I feel so helpless.
You did all that you could.
Now, you get some rest
and I'll take over.
I'm okay.
You have to start trusting
people, Alice.
Besides, you have a long hike
in the morning.
Okay.
[instrumental music]
[intense music]
[door creaks open]
[floorboard creaking]
[dramatic music]
You shoulda listened to me.
What do you want from us?
You can't leave here now.
What are you gonna do..
Kill us?
I have to protect my family.
I thought that you said
that your wife was dead.
I'm not talkin' about my wife.
I'm talkin' about my son.
Your son?
Jesse?
Jesse.
[heavy breathing]
[dramatic music]
[whimpering]

Jesse?

[growling]
[glass shattering]
[dramatic music]
[gun firing]
[breathing heavily]
[grunting]
[breathing heavily]
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
What happened to Jesse?
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.
You better start talking
or I'm gonna put a bullet
through your fucking skull.
Now!
It's a virus.
Like rabies, only much worse.
That thing that attacked you
your first night
at the campsite..
That was Ben, my son.
- You bullshit.
- He has the Feral virus.
And now your friends do too.
I kept him..
...locked up in the cellar.
Chained and sedated so that
he wouldn't harm anyone.
That I could study him
and maybe find a cure.
But, he escaped.
[grunting]
First is incubation.
The virus spreads
through the host
attacking the central
nervous system
killing the victim.
If the host isn't killed
with the attack
it's killed by the virus.
And then phase two kicks in.
Reanimation of the dead body.
Reanimate?
What do you mean, like a zombie?
You expect me
to believe this bullshit?
You can believe what you want.
But you seen it for yourself.
It lies dormant in the daytime
but at night, the virus wakes
and the body changes.
It becomes what you saw.
[indistinct]
I told you
you wouldn't believe me.
And what about my friend?
She doesn't have much longer,
she is going to die
and become a Feral.
Oh, my God.
And you should know this too.
It will be back.
They all will.
Why will they be back?
Because the food is here.
Food?
[sniffles]
He means us.
[sniffles]
[intense music]
Eight years ago, we came up here
on our annual family vacation.
Love comin' up here.
My wife, myself
my son, his wife, my..
My granddaughter.
Ben went out
to the woods to get firewood
or something.
He was attacked..
...by something.
I don't even know what.
I didn't see it.
He bled out
before I could move him.
He was gone.
That night, he killed his wife
and his daughter.
Tore his mother to pieces.
And then, they changed.
[snarls]
[gunshot]
They're gonna die
and they're going to turn.
You have to kill them.
I don't wanna die.
No one is gonna kill anyone.
- Let's go.
- What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna put you somewhere
where you can't cause trouble
until I can figure this out.
You can't leave me down here!
They're gonna return,
and you're gonna die
and I'm gonna be trapped
down here.
[crickets chirping]
Okay, so we have to assume
that there are
three of those things out there.
Three?
Jesse, Matt
Talbot's son.
You think Matt's one, too?
Yeah. His body disappeared.
Jesus.
I feel like we should be
doing something.
Can you go check on Brie?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
[footsteps approaching]
[mellow music]
Um..
Guys, you should come see this.
Like, now!
Hold this.
Is -- is she turning into
one of those things?
Shit.
What do we do?
I don't know, I..
We should tie her
to the bed? I..
Do you think that
will even hold her?
That thing was really
fucking strong.
Maybe..
Maybe we should just..
What?
Put her out of her misery.
- You mean kill her?
- Yes.
- That's murder, Jules.
- Okay, she's not human anymore!
- You can see it.
- She's our friend!
Our friend is about to
rip us apart!
Okay, I'm a doctor.
I don't take lives, I save them.
I'm talking about saving
our lives.
We're not taking any lives,
and that is final!
Do you have a better plan?
Whatever we do,
we need to do it quick.
Shit.
Um, grab -- grab her feet.
Grab her feet.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Okay.
[breathing heavily]
We need your help.
Now you want my help?
I'm not here to fix
your problems.
She's about to become
your problem, too.
[Brienne whimpering]
We got two, three minutes tops.
[whimpering]
We need to get her
into the cellar.
You need to shoot her
in the head.
She is going to turn!
You are going to help us
get her into the cellar, now!
- You don't understand!
- Please!
[intense music]
[screaming]
Hold her still!
Hold still!
Get her arm!
[shrieking]
Ah!
Little help here!
[grunts]
[whimpering]
[screaming]
Got it!
Hey, you're going to be okay.
Okay?
You're gonna be okay.
Go get me the medical supplies
from upstairs.
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.
- Can you sedate her?
- Why?
- Before she injures herself.
- What's the point?
There's nothin' you can do
for her now.
This isn't a debate.
Just do it.
[Brienne screaming]
You do realize
you're makin' a mistake?
Yeah, we'll see.
[screaming continues]
I don't know how long
that's gonna hold her for.
If she wakes up again,
we'll just dose her.
Hey.
You're gonna be okay.
I don't feel very good.
Best thing you can do for her..
...is a bullet.
- Put her out of her misery.
- Will you give it a rest?
You don't understand
what's at stake here, do you?
This goes way beyond
self-preservation.
Once we're all Ferals,
how long do you think
it's gonna be before one of us
makes it to the outside world?
Well, we'll have to make sure
that doesn't happen.
- Hurry up, Jules!
- I'm coming!
[growling]
[rustling]
Here you go.
- Alice?
- Yeah?
You're a really good person.
- I mean that.
- Hey.
You hold my hand, okay?
[sniffles]
What do we do about him?
Okay, that should,
that should do it.
Will it hold?
I guess.
I thought you were a Girl Scout.
- Tie a knot.
- I'm, I'm from Brooklyn.
We don't have Girl Scouts.
[clatters]
They're here.
Fuck! Could this get
any worse?
You haven't seen worse yet..
...but it's comin'.
Where's your knife?
Is that your thing..
...stabbin' people in the back?
Shut up.
- Hey!
- What?
You better do something
about your friend.
Oh, shit.
Gina?
- Is she changing?
- Come untie me.
- And I -- I'll help.
- No.
I can't help
if I'm tied to a post.
I can't do that.
Okay?
Just, just tell me
what to do, all right?
Maybe you could sedate her.
Go over to the table
where the bottles are.
Umm..
What do I need?
Thiopental.
- What's that say?
- Thiopental.
Okay, that's it.
Use that one.
Now, find a needle,
one with the top on.
Not that one.
Okay.
Turn the bottle upside down.
Stick the needle in the center
of the rubber stopper.
- Okay.
- Pull back on the plunger.
Okay.
All right. I got it.
Now, what do I do?

[grunting]
[breathing heavily]
Jules.
Hey.
You're gonna be okay.
[footsteps]
What happened?
You were drugged.
Where's Talbot?
I don't know.
But I hear something moving
up there.
I don't think it's him though.
Sounds like an -- another Feral.
So, we're trapped down here.
Yeah, well, this is probably
the safest place we could be.
It doesn't know we're down here.
Then let's keep it that way.
[Brienne screaming]
Shit. Alice!
[growling]
Alice?
Please, strap her.
[banging on door]
What are we gonna do?
You listen to me carefully.
That thing is gonna come
through that door any second.
And when it does, I need you
to run up those stairs
as fast as you can,
you understand me?
But how do I get to past it?
I'll distract it.
Don't you worry about me.
You worry about getting up those
steps and out of this cabin.
And when you're out, you run
as fast as you can, you hear me?
[growls]
I'm scared.
I know, I know.
Me too, okay?
I love you.
[growling]
[breathing heavily]
[growling]
Go!
[intense music]
[panting]
Ah!
[gunshot]
[exhales]
[distant screaming]
Jules!
Jules!
[Feral growling]
Help!
Help!
[intense music]
[gunshot]
[grunts]
Are you okay?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's wrong?
It..
Oh, God.
No, no, no. Oh, no.
I'm not turning into one
of those things.
Okay?
I'm not, not doing that.
No fucking way in hell.
You need to end this.
You can't ask me to do that.
- Do you care about me?
- I care about you, yeah.
Then do it.
Please?
I can't, I'm sorry.
- Gimme the gun.
- No, there has to be another way.
What are you gonna do?
Are you, you gonna drug me
and chain me up in the cellar?
Alice, if..
...if you love me, okay..
...even just a little..
...you'll do this for me.
Please.
I..
I..
It's okay.
[mellow music]
[insects chirping]
[sniffles]
[sighs]
It's okay.
