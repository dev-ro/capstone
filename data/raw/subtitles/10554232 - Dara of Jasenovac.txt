Translated by NexWex
Improvements : N4ko
During the 2d World war,
the Independant State of Croatia,
lead by the fascist Ustasha Regime,
founded the camp complex of Jasenovac for the
extermination of Serbs, Jews and Romani.
It was the only one of its kind in Europe not run
by Germans and the only one that had camps
for children in its composition.
Walk !
Why they don't take those womans too ?
Because they're not Serbs.
- What are  they ?

But how do they that ?
They're the same as we are.
Because we cross like this,
and they doing like this.

No need for that.

Your mother will get you a sister
once we get out of here.

- See how she feels like.
Leave her now. Come here.
I don't know why we dig this much

It's a tomb.

Dara. come here.
Do you know something about our mother ?
- What happened ?
- She was taken away.
- For work ?
- Yes.
I don't know why they let me here.
They will take me maybe.
You don't lie, they didn't kill her ?
I told you the truth.
What should I do with them ?
Tell them that she will come tomorow.
What when she won't come tomorow ?
Tell them again,
that she will come tomorow.
How could we lie to them ?
It's better like that.
It will be easer for them.
She said something about our mother ?
She said that she will come tomorow.
Calm him right now, I'm gonna call them
to take him into the hospital.
Don't.

She will come tomorow, go to sleep.
What you're waiting for ? Go to sleep,

Thanks, for the last time.
Wait, come here.
- What's going on ?
- Don't go inside.
They will come to take some men away.
Thank you.
Can i ask you something ?
I heard that you can freely
move through camps.
- You're my only way to know...
- Say it.
I saw my dead son, the older one.
Jovo, 12 years old,
and wife Nada.
I have two more children.
I don't know if they're alive.

If i can find out somehow...
My daughter's name is Dara.
She is 10 years old.
My youngest son's name is Budo,
he's barely two. Last name is Ilic.
Please.
Maybe they were brought to Stara Gradiska.
Most of women and children are there.
Ask around, if you can.
Please.
But try to do your job
a little better.
If this Croatian warns you
once more, I'll have problems.
Here they are. Hide !
You are not Serbs anymore.
You are now, little Croats.
When we clean this country,
you will build it, because...
Get up !
- For Homeland, Prepared !
- Prepared !
Choose ten boys.

Let's go, right now in the truck !

A woman told me,
your children are alive.

- In Stara Gradiska mill.
What didn't filled prison

This bed is free, the one that was
here has been taken away.
I will take it, it's warmer here.
Do you have tobacoo maybe ?
- Where are you from ?
- From Mirkovac.
I am from Stara Gradiska.

- Yes.
Is it far from here to there ?
It has... about 30 km downstream.
- On which side of Sava river ?
- Over it.
Is there a mill ?
Yes,  near on the river side.
They emptied everything there,
for women and children.
There were no more place
in Gradiska prison.
An organisation came, and...
Ljubo Milos ordered it
to be emptied in three days.
Dear God, so many people
were killed that day.
My two children are still alive there.
My wife and older son
got killed.
I found their corpses here.
Same for me...
But I found all of mines.
- You don't have nobody ?
- Nobody.
- I must try to escape.
- Don't.
If you try, they will kill you and if not,
River Sava will do it.
It cannot be debated.
Even if you suceed, they will
also be on the other side.
As soon as they bring again us there...
...better that, than finding them dead.
Stop crying.
Brana, you're the oldest one.
Take care of your sister.
If they separate you,
remember your names,
from where you are
and name of your mother.
Come on, you heard me.
You must go !
I gave what I could.
As if there were no Croatian
children needing help.
Sorry, but we have documents !
And Ministers approved it too !
I don't give a damn about your
documents and ministers.
How much of our children
need a glass of milk ?

Why you didn't report him ?
Maybe they'd have taken him.
I can't.
You see that he is not good.
What's wrong with you ?
Why are you so sick ?
Don't even try, you'll get killed
before reaching the river.
Let's dig, come on.
- What's wrong with him ?
- I don't know.
It seems he's burning.
He is hungry.
Come on, take it.
Give it to him.
If he's not good, they'll take
him to the hospital.
He will be good.
Dara...
...they'll blame me if a child is
not good, I respond for you all.
He will be good.
He's strong.
You can eat crust, I know.
You have teeth.
Eat it.
What is wrong, Marko ?
- What is that ?
- He is not good.
Are you crazy ?
You want us to get infected ?
To the hospital, right now.
- Hospital won't help him.
- But he is still alive.
Move him.
- And the others ?
-I just came in, I'll check.
- Where are you going ?
- To help women who clean.
Good, you want to work.
It should be that way.
Go to yard. Report to clean up.
Pay attention,
take care of them all.
If an infection emerges,
I will judge you personally.
- Take him away.
- I understand.
Sister will finish it fast.
- What's wrong with Buda ?
- Nothing.
He looks sick.
He's good and
this is not your concern.
Be silent and work.
Can you guess which is shorter ?
I can't. I have not the will.
Dara, take this.
This is the last one,
my daughters took the others.
- What's that ?
- That is left from them.
Maybe you'll need it.
He's burning ! This is not good.
I don't know what to do.
I told you to give him to those womens.
- What are you doing ?
- He is too warm, he must cool down.
He's in fire. Are you crazy ?
- You want us all to get sick ?
- Mind your business.
Oh yeah. Come one Dusanka.
I managed to bring this.
Maybe he'll want it.
- Did he drink water ?
- He didn't.
Those evildoers will kill us all.
I am scared.
Poor child.
He needs his mother.
- There.
- I already warned you.
- He was good.
- Take him away, right now !
- No...
- Get away !
I'm sick of you,
you'll feed pigs tomorow.
If an other child is sick, report it
right now or I will kill you all !
Let me go...
He's all I got.
Come on, unload.
They brought children.
You two, unload and take
anything valuable from the dead.
- Take it back.
- It's for him.
Dead, you can't help him.
Put it back.
Take care of yourself now !
If he doesn't recover,
I dont care.
Don't say that !
It will be like it's written.
Your mother would like to see
at least one of you surviving.

- Prepared !
Dear Croats,
young Ustashe,
Croatian sons.
We need to build a Croatian
State for you.
For our children,
without burgain of guilt.
For youngsters who want to embrace
the power of Croatian history.
It will be a painfull operation.
Because that will
be a exam of maturity.
It will be a test
of our love for Croatia.
We have to put forward
traditionnal values.
We must think about that Croatia,
and how it will be in year 2000,
when all of us will be older,
or in graves.
We will follow this
work for a long period.
In addition to our
traditional qualities,
big heart,
combativeness,
spirit of freedom,
We need to add
a dose of rationality.
collective responsibility,
collective work,
collective political conscience,
Which we Croats,
almost always missed.
Thus we would build
one political doctrine,
That is valid today, as it could
be years 2000.
And that is :
Always base everything
on eternal foundations.
To that which is unchanging.
In trust in God, creator
of Earth and the sky
In your Croatian people.
If we pursue this goal,
than, not even the hell's power,
or the power of any
universal idea, won't break us.
Because we will like one,
intelligent,
biologically healthy,
mentally advanced
and capable people,
in all oportunities
knowing to choose one road.
All of us will be equals,
no one will be pushed away,
because of dialog.
A way that will shape
our ideology, laws, borders
and rights of the citizents
of Croatia.
To all of you, young Ustashe,
today and always
Be glad to be servants
of your homeland,
From the borders of Croatian
State to river Drina.
So, may God help you !
You, old man ?
Son, do what you got to do.
Long life to Croatian people !
Long life to the
Independant State of Croatia !
Long life !
Let's go, applause.
Wave !
Wave.
Young kids !
Croatian heroes.
Let's take picture.
Smile.
Ante.
When will they take us
to Sava again ?
When they'll decide to drown
Serbs downstream the river...
all the way to the Belgrade.
Please stop thinking about
running away, for God's sake.
To what should I think ?
To what ?
...And this is how grandma
pushed away the wolf.
The terrible wolf,
that run into wood,
to never come back.
And grandma went to sleep.
She felt asleep.
And like here you'll fell asleep.
Or should I...
Hide beneath, fast !
We should really put this in order.
Tomorrow, those women from
Red Cross come for an inspection.
They allways complain from something.
Well, if there wasn't hospital,
there wouldn't complain from anything.
- Any basement here ?
- There.
Great. Listen up !
Get down the weakest
and lefting jew children in there.
Stjepan, get the tool and
call me when all of that is ready.
Please, tell me.
What did you cook for dinner ?
Pork steaks with potatoes,
just like you love.
What are you waiting for ?
You heard the orders.
You two here and hallway,
I will taek care of the others there...
What you're looking ?
Work !
Come on, hurry.
Faster please !
Go into storage room.
Hold him, faster.
Come on, out of here.
You were hidden here...
Smart kid.
Listen, these women from Zagreb
will come tomorrow for children.
You must handle him.
- I can't...
- You have to.
Or they'll take him back
to the hospital right away.
He will end up like those
children before.
One little girl that was on the list
was killed in the bassement.
I have her number so,
we can try to give him her name.
Can I go with him ?
You can't, there is no way.
I dont accept us to be separated.
Even if you go, you will be separated
when you'll be given to families.
Trust me. It is his only chance.
You can see that we won't be
able to save him forever.
Do you have something
to dress him as a girl ?
Mileva left me a dress
from her daughters.
Where is it ?
In the bag, where I sleep.
Is he on the list ?
- Yes.
Let's go. In the bus.
Sweetheart...
Now will come auntie,
to take you away...
There, you will recover quickly.
Your syster doesn't leave you my love.
You're pretty...
...like a little girl.
Nobody will separate us forever.
I will find you...
...after all this will be over.
We'll return then in our house...
...and father will wait for us there.
See, yours are not here.
There is hope.
They must be alive.
- l'm going.
- Wait.
Good luck son.
A fugitive !
An other one ! Shoot !
Please, are all
the children listed here ?
- Yes.
- One is left there.
Bring him please.
Here is the number.
Run.
- Please.
- Stop !
- Her name is on the list ?
- Dusanka Dakic.
She is not listed.
- Please, take her.
- No way !
Back off !
Hurry up children.
Next time, I deserve it.
- Please, not now.
- He has to go.
That's him.
Where did you get this number ?
Please.
Please.
Nobody will ever separate us.
I promise.
- Name ?
- Milanka Diklic
Go on.
Come on sweetie.
Where are you going girl ?
No !
Stop !
Thank you.
What is your name ?
Dara Ilic, and
this is my brother Buda.
Can I take him ?
A brother...
We thought he was a girl.
He is handsome.
When you will give us to families,
give us together together.
Do not separate us.
I will try.
Where are you from, Dara ?
From Jasenovac...
