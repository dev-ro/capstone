Oh, fuck yeah!
Why's your door closed, Maxie?
Dad, I'm in sixth grade.
I need privacy sometimes.
Well... Look, I'm headin' to the airport.
Be back in two days.
Please be nice to your sister.
Help your mom, and do not touch the drone.
I won't. Bye.
I'm serious, okay?
It's not a toy. It's for my work.
Yep. Safe flight. Bye, Dad. Love you.
Thank you. Hey, come give me a hug, bud.
I'll give you two hugs when you get back.
I get it.
Why are you smiling?
Well, you're just growing up.
That's exciting to me.
It's not. Stop smiling.
I remember bringing you home
from the hospital
like it was yesterday.
Now, here you are,
sexually masturbating yourself.
-No, I f'ing wasn't.
-Hey, it's cool, fool.
It's like you got a new toy,
the best toy in the world,
and you just wanna keep playin' with it.
I don't know.
I just want you to know I'm proud of you.
Okay, do your thing. I'll see you later.
Love you. See ya in two days.
Amy, you are not gonna believe this.
Yo, guys. Check this out.
My babysitter told me
everyone in sixth grade gets hand jobs.
What's a hand job?
It's when a girl jerks you off
until you cum.
And then it's your job to clean it up.
I don't think it's "cum".
Yeah. C-U-M. Cum.
Middle school's way more intense
than elementary.
If we're gonna get through this,
we need to stick together.
Bean Bag Boys for life.
Speed bump.
Are your friends jelly
you're dating a college guy?
- Some of them, I think.
- Yeah?
Yeah. Wait, hey...
-Can I help you?
-Retreat, retreat!
Hey, Stranger Things, go fuck yourself!
-Hurry!
-Go, go, go!
You know those fucking guys?
Ha-ha!
No one can stop the Turzan of Uzkara.
Lucas, keep it in the case.
-Dude, it's worth 300 bucks.
-$600 now. I checked.
$600?
- We're millionaires!
- Yeah.
Do you guys wanna maybe go to
the skate park tomorrow after school?
I know what cocaine is.
Annabelle, get out of here.
Bean Bag Boys only.
I heard at the skate park,
the older kids will make you take drugs.
We'll never do drugs.
They destroy lives and communities.
You have no choice.
Mom!
Annabelle, don't antagonize your brother.
Come on, go upstairs. Now. Hey.
All right, Bean Bag Boys, finish up.
It's a school night.
Lights out, 8:30 p.m.
What? You said 8:45 p.m.!
Hey. Finish up.
I don't think I wanna go
to the skate park.
We're in sixth grade now.
We need to start doing sixth-grade things.
Ooh.
You wanna see Brixlee, don't you?
- Hi.
- Oh, my God!
Mom!
This park is fuckin' lit.
Yo, guys. The Scooter Squad is here.
You know who's really good at burns?
Atticus L.
He's so funny.
Atticus L.?
I'd smoke him in a burn war. Right, Max?
Ooh.
So...
are you gonna give Brixlee
the necklace you made her?
No. Shut up.
I haven't put it in a kiln yet.
You always have an excuse.
Thor, you never talk to girls.
Girls are a distraction.
Rock of Ages auditions are in two days.
Max! Come here!
Hey, Taylor.
People are saying you made Brixlee
a necklace in art class.
Nice try,
but I don't talk about my art projects
before they're finished.
If she had a crush on you,
would you admit you had a crush on her?
Does she have a crush on me?
I don't know. I've never asked her.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Fuck!
So, how'd it go, lover boy?
She might know about the necklace.
Veggie lasagna for dinner?
Everything's comin' up, Lucas.
I'll see you guys at school.
Bye!
Be safe.
Scooter Boys. Scooter Boys.
-Act cool. Act cool.
-Okay.
'Sup, Atticus?
You guys wanna see something cool?
Hell yeah!
What are we up to? What are we doing?
We're gonna sip a beer.
Scared?
-No. I've had, like, 5,000 sips of beer.
-Bitch, please.
Soren has the record. Three sips.
Three sips?
Three sips.
Whoa.
I'm already feeling something.
Delicious.
Careful, it's hot.
Are you gonna drink it or not?
I forgot.
I have musical auditions this Friday.
They drug test for beer.
Thor, just admit you're a scared
little wittle baby.
No, I'm not.
Want us to put the beer in a sippy cup
for you? Sippy Cup.
-No!
-Sippy Cup. Amazing burn, Atticus.
It's not a good burn.
His dad has two DUIs
and has to take the train to work.
That's a good burn.
-Sippy Cup, sing us a song.
-No.
How about "Twinkle Twinkle Little Bitch?"
Sippy cup!
Sippy cup! Sippy cup!
No, guys. He'll do it,
but he just needs more time to think.
Sippy cup! Sippy cup!
Bye.
Lasagna and soda?
Don't tell my parents you gave me this.
Kid is hilarious, right?
We're getting a divorce.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, okay.
I'll tell you.
Everything's gonna stay the same.
We promise.
Will we still watch This Is Us together?
Yes, of course. That's our favorite show.
That's our family show.
Except now, you gonna see it
on two different TVs, you know.
In two different houses.
So you have to watch the episode twice.
What about Taco Tuesday?
Taco Tuesdays are still going down.
Matter of fact, you're gonna have
two Taco Tuesdays.
Just one on Wednesday now.
-Twice the fun.
-Twice the fun.
Twice the tacos.
Everything's gonna stay the same.
Me and your mom, you know,
we still best friends. Right?
I mean, it would be nice
to have tacos together, as a family
but how about this,
we can just change it to Wing Wednesday.
Thor, inspired. Voice of an angel, man!
What are we walkin' on?
It does feel good, don't it?
What's wrong?
This song always makes me sad.
Don't forget,
Rock of Ages auditions are tomorrow.
It's my favorite musical.
I did make some pretty big changes though
based on my time in Hollyweird.
I think it'll really inspire
those of you who dare to dream.
Sick.
So, I looked at her,
but she was looking the other direction.
Then she looked at me,
and I was looking the other direction.
So, I think that someday,
we're gonna make eye contact.
That's cool.
This musical is gonna be lit.
Hey, Soren, look at this.
Sippy Cup is signing up for the musical.
Singing is for try-hards.
No! Someone signed me up as a joke.
I was just crossing it off. See?
Yeah, whatever, bitch tits.
Enough. Let's go.
I have places to be.
Sorry, Soren.
Don't listen to Atticus.
His dad doesn't even pay taxes.
It doesn't matter what Atticus says.
I've been thinking about quitting singing
ever since I was young.
Come on. We're gonna miss fish sticks.
Whoa! That's the best lunch
I've ever seen.
Yeah, my parents
are being super nice because...
because...
they're great, and...
They're great and everything's good.
Ooh. Wait! Is that a new earring?
-Yes, finally! Thank you for noticing.
-That looks cute on you.
Max, I'm not going for cute.
I'm going for sexy and hot.
Those are the only two things
I'm looking for.
You like it?
It looks infected.
Soren's so cool.
I heard he beat up Derek Bachman
and blow jobbed his sister.
He blow jobbed his own sister?
No! He blow jobbed Derek's sister.
Fucking legend.
I think Soren's calling me.
-'Sup?
-'Sup?
I heard you sipped a beer
like a fuckin' champ.
Yeah, I took a pretty big sip actually.
Cool.
I'm having a party tomorrow night.
All of these fools are comin'.
You in?
You should come. Trust me.
Yeah, I'll come.
But, you know, have to ask my mom.
Also, gonna be a kissing party.
You've French kissed girls before, right?
Yeah!
Of course.
Where?
Their mouths?
Yeah, dawg.
He's not gonna start sitting
with the popular kids, is he?
No.
If anyone should be over there, it's me.
We heard kids were calling you Sippy Cup
and we just wanted to let you know
you can always call
on the Student Coalition Against Bullying
for protection.
Does this look like a sippy cup?
No, it's a fucking juice box.
'Cause I'm not a fucking child.
So rude.
Oh, wait, can I bring Thor and Lucas?
So random.
No, they're cool.
I'm trying to keep it
half girls, half guys. You feel me, dawg?
I feel you, dawg.
But they're my best friends.
We do everything together.
We're the Bean Bag Boys.
That's a dope-ass name.
Fuck it. Bring 'em.
I ride or die for my squad, too.
Let me know what your mom says, dawg.
Okay. Bye, dawg. Bye, dawgs.
So?
Soren just invited us
to his party tomorrow.
-Soren?
-Yeah.
He said my name? He said "Thor"?
-Pretty much, yeah.
-Sweet.
Oh, there's also gonna be girls there.
You know what that means?
Drama!
Kissing.
So, do you guys know how to kiss?
-I have no fucking clue. No, not at all.
-No.
 Type "kissing."
Oh. No, no! "Boobs"!
"Breast cancer research.
How to find a bra that fits."
I have an idea.
"Are you 18 or older?"
I'm gonna click "Yes".
We're not 18 or older!
This could go on our permanent record.
I'm your stepmother.
You are not supposed to be looking
at me in the shower.
Don't tell my dad.
He'll make me quit the sports team.
Get up! Get up.
He's in trouble.
You deserve a punishment.
Pull down your shorts!
Is that what happens
when you get a stepmom?
Ew!
No way that's gonna fit in there.
Get out of there, girl.
Where did his hand go?
-Ew!
-Oh, my God!
Nobody even kissed.
Yeah, not on their mouths, at least.
My parents have a CPR doll.
We can go practice kissing on that.
Come on.
This is a really pretty CPR doll.
I guess I'll go first.
Stop!
What are you doing?
Kissing her?
You can't kiss someone
without their permission.
Remember? From assembly?
Pretend it's Brixlee.
Try to be a gentleman.
Okay.
Brixlee, can I kiss you?
Why?
Why?
Yeah. What do you like about me?
Well... you're sweet. You smell good.
You're smart, too.
You always push Henry in his wheelchair
even though he's super mean.
And just when I think
I've got you figured out,
you go ahead and start skateboarding.
I consent.
-How was it?
-Sticky.
Why does she have hair in her mouth?
You know what,
this isn't teaching us anything.
We need to see real people kissing.
That's the only way to know
if we're doing it right.
My neighbor is a total nymphomaniac.
Her boyfriend's always over.
She starts fires?
No, that's a pyromaniac.
She's a nymphomaniac.
Someone who has sex on land and sea.
Seriously?
Okay, I was gonna wait till tomorrow
to surprise you.
But can I just tell you?
-Nah, I'm good.
-No, you wanna know.
I can barely see anything.
I know we haven't been hanging out much,
ever since I met Benji
but I wanna make it up to you.
So, tomorrow I'm skipping school
and we're driving to the city
to see Kendrick Lamar.
Shut up!
-And we're gonna do molly!
-You thought of everything.
Of course I fucking have!
It's gonna be amazing!
Remix!
Well, Benji got us the molly.
- Benjamin.
- Oh, thank you!
Look.
This isn't working.
Maybe we could go climb a tree.
No, they'd see us.
No, I just meant let's go climb a tree.
Dude, wait.
I know a way we can see them kiss.
I can't.
It has a camera. We could see everything.
We can learn technique.
It's for his dad's work! It's not a toy!
Of course, it's a toy.
They sell it at toy stores.
My uncle flew a drone for the army
and now he yells in his sleep
and has crazy diarrhea.
It's messed up that he even keeps it
in the house.
You have to walk by it every day.
-He's torturing you.
-It's true.
It's like when your cousin walks around
in a bikini and she taunts you.
If he finds out, you'll be grounded.
You won't be able to go to Soren's.
And even worse,
you'll lose your father's trust.
-That's true, too.
-She'll love you for who you are.
Yeah, a shitty kisser.
Remember the porn from earlier?
That guy didn't even know how to kiss.
He was just licking that woman's asshole.
-You wanna kiss an asshole, Max?
-Nope.
Max, don't listen to him.
He just wants to go
because he's obsessed with popular boys.
Believe me, Max, you don't wanna go
to Soren's not knowing how to kiss.
Whoo!
So tomorrow, after you get some girl time,
why don't you come over for some man time?
No, I told you I'm hanging out
with Lily this weekend.
Yeah, it's just...
You know, it's hard for me not to see you,
'cause you're my best friend.
But Lily's my best friend.
- Yeah, I get it.
- Totally, totally get it. Yeah.
I'll probably just hang out
with my ex, Margaret.
Are you trying to make me jealous?
No. Why, are you jealous?
Yeah, this isn't working out.
I know. You're not hot enough
to be acting like this.
So, the next time that you're wondering
where all the nice guys went,
just remember that you let one
walk right out the door.
What?
I didn't say anything.
I never wanna see you again.
You okay?
Wait, where'd the guy go?
Who cares? The girls just hugged.
They are definitely gonna kiss.
Think I need to get closer.
You hear that?
What is that?
It's fucking spying on us.
All right, it's my turn to fly.
Give it!
-I just wanna buzz 'em.
-No!
Give me. You're gonna break it.
You want it? Fine!
Shit!
Ha!
Oh! No!
Shit! What the hell, Thor?
That was both of our faults.
Dad's gonna kill me! What do I do now?
What the hell?
We say there was a break-in.
They trashed the place,
then took the drone.
That's the most stupid fucking idea
I've ever heard!
Guys, guys.
All we have to do is just go over there,
and tell the truth.
Then God will be on our side.
Hey. Can I help you?
I hope so, madam.
We were using our drone
to follow a family of turtles
and we thought it might have crashed
in your back yard.
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's here. Come on in.
- So, you guys like turtles?
- Yeah.
That's awesome.
Time's up, motherfuckers.
Shit, it's a trap!
You think I give a fuck about turtles?
We're sorry.
We just wanted to learn how to kiss.
Lucas,
that's none of their business.
We should've just told the truth.
We're going to a kissing party
and none of us have ever kissed,
and we're scared!
Goddamn it, Lucas!
I've had sex before
but I've never kissed a girl.
Just go online and type in "how to kiss."
That's what everyone does.
Oh.
Shit's very easy.
Look, can we please have the drone back?
It's a BD Rolling Thunder.
It's my dad's. He needs it for work.
Can I please have it back?
I really need it. Please.
I don't think so.
If you don't give it back,
I'll tell my dad you stole it.
And I'll tell him that you're a pervert.
We'll tell the whole school.
This is sensual harassment.
We'll tell everyone
that you're a misogynist.
I never massaged anyone!
This is what happens
when you don't respect women.
I respect women! My mom's my best friend!
What about me?
Oh, God! I'm so fucked.
My dad's gonna kill me.
You had to snoop on them.
You're such a feminist.
I'm not a feminist! I love women.
And my parents are definitely
gonna call your guys' parents.
We're all gonna get grounded.
Forget Soren's party. We're fucked.
Why are you smiling?
This is actually your fault.
This is leverage.
Oh. Bingo!
-What is it?
-I have no idea.
That's a tampon.
What's it for?
Girls shove it up their buttholes
to stop babies from coming out.
An eighth-grader told me that.
The human body's truly a mystery.
I can't believe they still eat chewables.
The gummies are so much better.
I like the chewables, and I want one.
Fucking child-proof bullshit!
Thor, Thor, Thor!
It's the girls.
Hello.
 You took my bag.
It has my license, my phone.
Bring it back right now!
Fuck that noise. I want my drone back.
I got this. I got this.
What did you just say,
you little bitch?
I'll take a shit down your throat.
Why are you talking like that?
Hannah, I have a little brother.
You're supposed to scare them.
Well, you scared me.
Listen, we were just trying
to teach you a lesson.
I promise you we were gonna give
the drone back.
No way! They could trick us again.
Or overpower us.
Oh, my God. What if they take the molly?
Then we wouldn't be able to take it.
No, they're children. They would die.
This is Max from earlier.
Meet us at the playground
across from John Adams,
tomorrow at 7:40 a.m.
Bring the drone and don't fuck
with the Bean Bag Boys.
That was tough.
Very tough.
I kinda got a boner
talking to those girls.
 We're still on the phone.
-Shit!
-Shut that off!
-What the shit?
-Fuck!
Six, seven,
eight, nine...
eleven, twelve, thirteen...
Don't come any closer.
-Why?
-'Cause you could overpower us.
So, put the drone on the slide,
and count back from 100,
and close your eyes.
And don't try anything funny.
There are witnesses.
Okay. We have a long drive ahead of us.
So, give us the bag or I will hurt you.
Do not test me.
Threats will get you nowhere, peasant.
Just give us the fucking molly!
Okay. Who's Molly?
'Cause she's not with us.
Guys, molly is a sex drug.
Dateline did an exposé on it.
You had us bring drugs
to a fucking playground?
There are children here!
Shit.
It's okay. I know what to do.
We're making a citizen's arrest.
You're both under arrest.
-Get on the ground.
-Sweet Jesus.
- Up, up, up! Hands up!
- Stay still!
- Hands up!
- Get down now!
Get down now!
Did you just reload your fake gun?
Are you mocking me? Are you mocking me?
Anything will be used against you
that you say.
In court.
You know, you're the one holding drugs,
so, why don't I do a citizen's arrest
on you?
Fuck!
Timeout, crackheads!
Oh, my God.
Deal's off. We can't let them put drugs
back on the street.
Look at those dirty fucking junkies.
Their lives are already ruined.
Let's just give 'em the drugs
and get the drone.
Maybe there's a way we can protect
our community and get the drone back.
Stall them.
So, what do you plan to do
with those drugs?
Take 'em and feel amazing.
They're addicts.
Yeah.
So, you been druggin' your whole life?
E'ry day.
Yeah? Nice.
What's he doing? Hey!
It's working! It's working!
Yes!
Fly it to the school!
Watch the trees!
We're gonna make it!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck!
Those girls are lucky
I didn't kick their asses.
Oh, no! They found us!
Oh, shit!
They're on school property!
They don't care! They're tweaking!
You know what we need?
- No. Don't say it. Don't say it.
- We'll look like losers.
SCAB!
- Shut up! Shut up!
- SCAB!
-Zip it.
-SCAB!
What is that?
There's three boys in danger!
We're scared! SCAB, help us!
- We're okay.
- We're not scared. We're fine.
We're just walking into school.
Average day.
Jesus Christ.
Bullying is whack,
get on the right track.
Bullying is whack...
When you attack one of us,
you attack all of us.
Your weakness gives us strength.
Well, those kids stole my bag.
Not today, bully!
Not today!
- What the fuck?
- Bullying is whack,
get on the right track.
This is the best day of my life.
Bullying is whack, get on the right track.
Don't worry. We'll find them later.
SCAB just tagged us on Instagram.
First "Sippy Cup" and now this?
I'm two weeks into sixth grade,
and I'm already a social piranha.
Guys, my dad gets back at 5:00.
If we don't get a new drone by then,
I'm grounded.
Which means we're all grounded,
which means no party,
which means no Brixlee.
"Sippy Cup" for life.
No Brixlee, no friends, no hope...
parents fighting,
trapped in our rooms, all alone...
two Taco Tuesdays.
So, Max, what are we gonna do?
We're gonna ditch school,
and get a new drone.
Stop thinking with your big old dick, Max!
That could go on our permanent record.
Max's big old dick is pointing us
in the right direction.
Thank you.
If anyone else kisses Brixlee, I'll die.
Wait, what? Here's the plan...
I'm gonna bring a beer to Soren's,
and I'm gonna sip that beer
so everyone will know...
That you're an alcoholic.
That would be great.
Guys, the only place around here
that has one is at North Point Galleria.
That's four miles away.
Four miles?
How the fuck are we getting four miles?
-You have Uber.
-No.
It goes directly through my mom's phone.
She'll know.
Then we bike.
Where are you even going to get
the money for a new drone?
-What?
-You know.
Our Turzan of Uzkara card?
No way!
-You said everyone wants to buy it.
-We got it together.
And we're gonna sell it together,
as friends.
Come on, Lucas.
Bean Bag Boys do everything together.
Okay. Guess that makes sense.
Yes!
Lucas!
-Bean Bag Boys for life.
-Yeah!
We're being so bad.
-I need to get rid of these drugs.
-What are you doing?
Getting rid of the drugs.
I'm just gonna throw them in the stream.
It can contaminate the water.
Then we could throw it in the forest.
It's a sex drug.
What if a fox eats it
and tries to fuck a squirrel?
It'll kill him.
Well then how do we get rid of drugs?
The same way we get rid of a baby.
-Abortion?
-Adoption?
No! We'll drop it off at the firehouse
on our way up to the mall.
That's a really good idea.
Oh, I just got a bite on our card.
Nice. Give him my address.
My parents aren't home,
and I have the best snacks.
PeterPan69 is gonna be here
in five minutes to buy the card.
Well, let's get ready.
I found all of these weapons
in the back of my parents' closet.
I still don't get why we need weapons.
He could be a pedophile.
He can't molest all three of us.
All he needs is one.
"-nal beads"?
AKA nunchucks, motherfucker.
It's not a toy!
Oh, shoot.
They smell like shit.
Hello.
- I'm looking for Lucas.
- That's me.
I'm Claude.
Hey.
It's my mom back there.
Hiya!
Let's cut the shit. Are you a pedophile?
What? No.
Lucas, if you were a pedophile
standing in front of three single boys,
would you admit it?
Probably not.
Then why would he?
Oh, come on. Do I look like a pedophile?
-Yes. Absolutely.
-1,000%
That's not fair.
You look more like a pedophile
than anyone I've ever seen.
Look, I'm not a pedophile. I'm a cool guy.
Fine. You can come in,
but please take your shoes off.
You know,
I've searched the world for this.
Why are you bringing the paintball gun?
In case anyone fucks with us.
This card is exquisite.
How'd you get it?
The summer I moved here,
me, Max, and Thor
started a dog-washing business.
We earned eight bucks,
and we used the money to buy
an extension pack and this card was in it.
Well, you got very lucky.
The real luck was meeting Max and Thor.
Fascinating.
We started calling ourself
the Bean Bag Boys. You know why?
Because you had some beanbags?
That's right.
Yeah, genius.
You got yourself a deal.
Let's go. Let's make it happen.
No, I can't do this.
Sorry.
Lucas, get your butt over here right now.
Excuse me, is this how
all 12-year-olds conduct business?
What the hell just happened?
I thought you were cool with this.
You said we wouldn't do this
if one of us wasn't on board.
I'm not on board.
Why do you care so much?
Why don't you care?
This card has a lot of memories.
And you're just gonna throw it all away
because you wanna kiss some basic girl?
Savage.
Brixlee isn't just some girl.
We're probably gonna get married.
Every marriage ends in divorce!
Lucas...
you're out-voted.
Listen, I can tell
you're lashing out with anger
but Brixlee is probably
the love of my life.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could I get a glass of water, please?
Madam?
Hey, guys?
Yeah.
What can you tell me about her backstory?
Where's she supposed to be from?
She seems quite exotic.
Okay, listen carefully
'cause I'll make this offer only once.
Four hundred bucks
to take her off your hands.
No. We need 550 US.
Fuck off.
What? That's my entire allowance.
Listen, Claude,
let's just cut the bullshit.
I'm the son of a businesswoman.
And I think we both know
if you didn't want to buy the doll,
you woulda left already.
Stop treating us like kids.
We know how things work.
So, do you want to buy
the CPR doll or not?
Fools!
I'd have paid a thousand.
Anyone else feel like
he's gonna fuck that doll?
Yee-haw!
We should hydrate.
We've been biking for almost
14 minutes straight.
I don't think I've ever been
this far from home.
I think I did a production
of Cats around here.
You're really not gonna sing anymore?
Yeah, I've never been happier.
Just give us the drugs.
Fuck! How'd you find us?
Her phone. They tracked us.
We're not giving you these drugs.
We're giving them to firefighters.
Get help!
Go!
We're in a car, dipshits.
You're not gonna outrun us.
Not on my fast bike, nerds!
Good luck getting your car
in here, losers!
Shit.
Where are you going?
Hey!
You're not getting these drugs back!
Just give her the sex drugs!
Peel off!
I won't let you destroy your life!
Are you okay?
-Are you okay?
-Lucas, are you okay?
What the hell happened?
We were running away from our babysitter
'cause she was trying
to touch our penises!
-What? That is not true!
-Yes, it is!
- I wasn't.
- Yeah, you were!
I wasn't.
-Go, go, go!
-What happened?
Go, go, go!
Oh, my God. Lucas, are you okay?
I think I'm fine.
- Your arm!
- Oh, hell no.
-No, I'm gonna call 9-1-1!
-Help!
No, it's okay. This happens all the time.
Come on, we gotta go.
We're good, come on.
I'll get the bikes.
Okay.
I threw their phone in a prickle bush,
so they can't track us anymore.
The pain!
Lucas, you have to be quiet.
Okay, do we have any ice?
No, we're in a fucking alley.
What about pain medication?
-We have the molly we can give him.
-No!
Yeah, he's probably just gonna try
and have sex with us.
Call an ambulance!
Mission's over!
We'll get busted!
Plus, do you even have insurance?
-I don't know! Do you?
-I don't know!
I think I only have a deductible.
It's all right.
This happens to MMA fighters all the time.
We just gotta ram your arm
into something very hard
so it pops back in place.
Fine. Fuck it!
Let's just get this over with.
Come on. Easy. All right.
One, two, three!
Wrong arm!
-Okay, new site, new site.
-Okay.
Okay, lie down on your back
and gimme your arm.
Come on.
All right.
It says this next part's gonna hurt,
that you should bite down
on something hard.
I know.
Open. There you go.
Great.
Okay. On three.
One! Two! Three!
-Just got a text from Taylor.
-What'd she say?
She wants to know why you aren't in school
and if you're coming to the party tonight.
Just write...
Okay, sorry. One, two, three!
Oh. Let me help.
-Lucas! On three!
-Lucas! One! Two! Three!
Wow.
I didn't think that'd actually work.
You're gonna be good, man.
No.
I'm really not.
My parents are getting a divorce.
What'd you do?
-Thor!
-What?
Sorry.
My dad's moving out.
Whatever happens between your parents,
you always got the Bean Bag Boys.
We'll never split up.
Bean Bag Boys for life.
You promise?
Promise.
Come on, let's get you
some Children's Tylenol.
-Want some help, buddy?
-No, I got it.
Okay, just do it.
Hey, Miles.
Hey, man. Coming in or coming off?
Just got off a triple.
Yeah, I don't care if I get mugged.
I'm not typing up
any more paperwork today.
Cop.
Shit,
we have D-R-U-G-S on us.
He knows how to spell.
Just act normal, pretend to talk.
About what?
Just be normal!
What do you think about politics?
It's a complicated issue.
This cop's acting weird.
He's eye-fucking us.
Just act normal. Just laugh.
We're just two cool guys laughing.
We skipped school.
Lucas!
Are we in trouble?
You know, usually I'd call this in...
but because you were honest with me,
I'm gonna let you slide, all right?
Just promise not to do it again, okay?
We promise. Thank you, sir.
All right.
That was a close one.
Wait, where's Thor?
Hold it.
Come here.
What do you have in your pants?
My penis.
Pull it out.
I also have a big dick.
Put it back.
I'm being generous today.
We also have drugs.
Dude!
He was onto us.
Okay, what do you have?
Schedule-one controlled substance
with intent to distribute.
Brother, these are vitamins, okay?
Children's vitamins at that.
No, those are drugs!
Now, look, if that's drugs,
then this is drugs, too.
If you don't arrest us, I'll report you.
-Lucas!
-Leave me the fuck alone.
I mean, sorry to fucking swear
at kids but, fuck.
You know, I'm gonna arrest you
for fucking ruining my day.
All right? I'll take them. Let me go home!
-He's calling for backup.
-What do we do?
No, no, listen.
I decided I don't want kids.
What's up?
The cop's eye-fucking us.
We have to make a run for it.
I know what to do.
Well, no, it's not up for...
Well, no, you may be detective,
but in the marriage, we're equal.
Just hang up. Who cares?
This is free 'cause I'm a cop.
What the fuck, Thor?
You didn't even care about my shoulder.
You just wanted a beer.
I can care about two things.
Yeah, you and your stupid beer!
Now we're fugitives.
Why are you yelling at me?
I just ran off without my family's bikes.
Cycle Sundays are fucked!
Guys, guys.
The mall!
-Holy shit! We made it!
-Yes! Yes!
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, shit.
Holy mother...
Goddamn it!
Great. Now we're trapped between
a highway and the authorities.
Well, we wouldn't be in this position
right now if you weren't such a narc.
Guys! The mall's right there!
All we have to do is cross the highway.
And the cars aren't even moving!
Now, are we fifth-graders
or are we sixth-graders?
Well, I'm going back into the woods.
I'll live off of rain water and squirrels.
I don't give a fuck.
No, you won't.
Oh, my gosh.
No. It's like a parking lot. See?
Wait, you stole another beer?
What the fuck, Thor?
Hey! You guys aren't the ones
who's gonna have "Sippy Cup"
on their goddamn tombstone.
God, say it, don't spray it.
Get off the freeway!
Children crossing.
Please, children are crossing.
What are you guys doing?
Get back to the side!
-Go! Now!
-Go, go, go.
Fucking idiots!
Wait, I got a message.
Oh, it's from Taylor.
She said Marcus is coming to the party.
He has a huge crush on Brixlee.
She's definitely gonna kiss him.
He's the nicest kid in our grade.
Wait. I'm the nicest kid in our grade.
It goes me, Marcus, Max, you.
I'm way nicer than Max.
No, you're not!
You made Ms. Willoughby cry last year.
Hey, she was already crying.
I just took her picture.
Guys, guys!
-Look! It started.
-Oh, shit!
Shit!
Oh, fuck!
Let's go back!
- Oh, no!
- We're trapped!
Let us out!
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.
No, we're not.
We just need to time it, okay?
We just need to time it right!
We can do this, guys!
We can do this!
No!
Max!
Are you batshit crazy?
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh, shit! He made it.
I did it!
Lucas.
Lucas, look at me right now.
I know you're scared. I'm not at all.
Shut up, Thor!
-Lucas, fucking no!
-Shit, shit!
Lucas!
No! Lucas!
I'm not dead!
I'm not dead! Yes!
You got it, man! Come on!
Fuck you!
I love you, too! Now come over here!
I want my mom.
-Come on! Come on!
-Come on!
I'm fine! I'll just live here. I'm good.
-Come on!
-You got this!
All right. Come on, Thor.
You are not Sippy Cup. You're a badass.
Oh, shit, my beer!
Oh, shit!
Wait!
That's my dad's CPR doll.
-Oh.
-That's my dad's CPR doll!
We're not murderers!
-We're saved!
-We're not fucking killers!
We're not killers!
Beep, beep! Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Sorry. Excuse me. Gotta get through.
Sorry!
Hey.
We called about the BD Rolling Thunder.
I'm so sorry, you guys.
Sold it.
Ha-ha. Nice joke. So funny.
No, I did. I sold it.
Two girls, said they knew you.
-Fuck you!
-Jesus!
I'm gonna kill your family...
Ease off the sugar?
-And turn your whole family into zombies!
-Max!
I was gonna say...
You didn't let me finish.
They left a note for ya.
- Why are they walking like that?
- I don't know.
How'd you guys track us?
We threw your bag in prickle bushes.
Dumbass, you told us
that your life would be over
if you didn't get a BD Rolling Thunder.
And this is the only place
a child could get to on a tricycle.
Okay. I have the drugs.
Now give me the drone.
You fucking kidding me?
What in the actual fuck?
These are just gummy vitamins.
Told you she was gonna check.
Where is the molly?
-Where is it?
-A cop has it.
You gave our drugs to a cop?
Wait, look.
I know you don't know us,
and you think we're just stupid kids
but just listen to me.
Whatever problems you're having,
drugs are not the answer.
Drugs just give you
a false sense of reality.
You may think your lives are bad
but you have family and friends
who love you.
Can you shut the fuck up?
I just spent $600 on a fucking drone.
You ruined my passionate moment.
- Well, it was stupid.
- This day is fucked.
Benji is the only one who has molly
and he won't sell it to us.
Okay, well, I'm sorry, we're fucked.
We'll do it.
We'll get you drugs.
The fuck we will.
What the hell, dude?
Do you think he would sell to kids?
We're not kids.
We're tweens.
What do we have to lose?
So, it's a deal?
Max, this is fucking insane.
Just take your goddamn punishment.
Lucas and I will go to the party
and we'll cockblock anyone
that gets near Brixlee.
They didn't invite you.
What?
The popular kids only invited me.
What do you mean?
They think you're kind of... random.
Oh.
But it's okay
'cause once those guys get to know you,
they'll see what I see.
That you're not random.
That you're specific.
I'm not buying drugs.
Neither am I.
You guys don't have to.
I'll do all the talking.
I just need your height in there.
You're the only one of us that looks
like they could be in college.
Guys...
are you in or out?
So, you guys did all of this
for a kissing party?
No, there's also gonna be cool boys there.
Remember my first kissing party.
It was the summer after sixth grade
at Manush Patel's house.
Who'd you kiss?
Manush's sister.
Wait, you weren't there?
No, we didn't really know each other then.
I mean, we were in the same grade
but we didn't really become close
until eighth grade.
Oh, I just figured you guys knew
each other for longer.
Yeah, everybody knows you meet
your best friends in kindergarten.
Yeah.
Yeah, the only reason you're friends
with people back then
is 'cause you live close to each other.
Yeah, because your parents are friends.
No, that's not true for us.
We're friends because we like each other.
And we live close together.
And our parents are friends.
Okay, come here.
Go in, buy two pills. Ask for Benji.
Do not mention Hannah.
Who's Hannah?
-I am.
-Oh.
I'm Max.
Yeah, I know who you are.
Just go in there, buy the pills,
and then I'll trade you for the drone.
Okay, if this goes bad, drive off.
-Okay.
-Okay.
It's not too late to turn back.
No. We have to get the drugs,
so we can get the drone,
so we can go to the party.
Hello?
I am your daddy!
You are my babies!
Yes, Daddy!
You will all stay down here
and suffer until you learn to be men.
Yes, Daddy!
- What do babies wear?
- Diapers!
That's right!
Good evening. We're looking for Benji.
Hey, Dickless, come here.
Yes, Daddy.
All right, I need you to go find Benji
and tell him he's got visitors.
Yes, Daddy.
I ask the fucking questions!
That's your son?
You guys can go sit your asses down
over there and wait.
Whatever happens to you
is your own fucking fault!
Drop and give me 20, you fucking babies!
Yes, Daddy!
Four! Get up!
Can I help you?
Good afternoon.
We would like to buy
two pieces of molly, please.
Did Rafi from Sigma Nu send you?
He did, that fucker.
You guys are, like, seven.
Except for you.
I recognize you from Econ. What's up, man?
Seriously, I'm not selling drugs to kids.
We're not kids, we're tweens.
Who told you to come here?
Sell us the drugs, and you'll find out.
All right.
Stay there.
Hey.
How long do you think he's gonna be?
You made me high!
Tell me who sent you.
Hannah.
What? I'm high as fuck.
So, this is what she thinks of me?
You can tell Hannah
that if she wants molly,
she can suck my dick.
You shouldn't talk about women like that.
The only time she should suck your dick
is when she gives you consent.
You can suck my dick.
And you can suck my dick, too.
What about me? I'm just gonna sit here?
We're the Bean Bag Boys.
We do everything together.
Get the fuck out of here,
you little fucking babies. Let's go.
Get out!
Hey, guys, wait.
I have something here
that might change your mind.
Hurry up.
- Pledges!
- Yes, Daddy!
Bitch! Now who's the baby?
-Holy shit.
-What the fuck?
If I don't get those drugs,
I'm gonna be grounded!
And then I'll never get to kiss Brixlee.
Max! What the fuck are you doing?
You sell drugs, we came here to buy them.
So, now you're gonna sell us the drugs.
Do not test me!
Okay.
You want the drugs?
I'm not your parent. Here.
Thanks.
Oh, shit.
Oh, you're fucking dead.
Fuck's going on down here?
She just dropped the charges.
Oh, God.
Holy shit.
Max, watch out!
I got your back.
Thor!
Your ass is mine!
Oh, my God! I just killed a man!
Lucas, get the drugs!
We were never here!
Start the fucking car!
What's happening?
Fucking go!
- Fuck?
- Shit, shit, shit!
Drive! Drive!
Lucas, drugs.
No, no, no.
Let me see what's in the bottle.
Yeah. Of course.
Okay, just, give it to me.
Wow, you guys are little badasses.
It's 'cause we're the Bean Bag Boys.
I don't know what that means.
We have beanbags.
It's been real, guys.
Have fun at your kissing party.
Thank you.
Oh. We're only 1.7 miles away.
What's wrong? We got the drone.
Everything worked out.
Max.
I got punched in the fucking face, okay?
We bought drugs.
Can we just go home now?
Guys, it's my dad.
Hey, Dad!
Hey, buddy!
I got on the early flight,
so I'll be home in 15 minutes.
Fifteen minutes from now
or 15 minutes from later?
Ha-ha. Funny guy.
I'll see you soon.
My dad'll be home in 15 minutes.
Maybe he won't notice
that the drone's gone.
He'll notice.
He's very observant.
That's why my mom fell in love with him.
The drone has to be home before your dad.
-I know.
-Just the drone. Not you.
Just the drone.
Okay.
Here we go.
-Yes!
-Yes!
- Careful!
- I got this, I got this. Oh!
Fly like the wind, Max.
Yeah, take a right up here.
-I see your house.
-There it is, there it is.
The windows are closed.
-Shit, what do I do?
-The chimney!
-It's very tight.
-You got this.
Shit, I can't see. I can't see.
There's ash all over the camera.
-Use the Force.
-No, no. I can do this.
I know my house perfectly.
I can do this with my eyes closed.
Don't break anything.
Trust me, I got this.
-I'm the best pilot ever!
-Yes!
-I think we did it.
-Yeah.
Mission accomplished!
Hey, Dad.
Did you get home safe?
I cannot believe that I trusted you!
I explicitly told you,
"Do not take the drone out."
Oh, my God.
I love you.
Dad?
Dad, please. Say "I love you" back.
I need to hear it.
Hello?
My dad said I'm grounded.
Now I'm never gonna be able
to kiss Brixlee.
It's okay, Max. There'll be other parties.
Lucas, you don't get it!
He's right, Lucas.
This party could change our lives,
and you don't even care.
It's not cool at all.
Yeah, you would know what's not cool.
What the fuck does that mean?
Go sip a beer, Sippy Cup.
I love beer.
So yes, I will.
And you may think you're so mature
but the truth is, you don't have pubes.
And I have six.
You say you have pubes,
but you also say you drink beer.
And I know you don't.
Stop arguing!
Just admit you skipped the audition
because you thought it wasn't cool...
even though your voice is a fucking gift.
And you always talk a big game,
and you never back it up.
Like on the freeway.
Oh, sorry I didn't wanna cross
12 lanes of traffic,
so you can kiss some skank.
Oh, shit.
She's not a skank, she's the love
of my life. You take that back!
- Hey!
- Hey! No karate!
Stop fighting!
You should never call a woman a skank.
You should never call a woman anything!
And you!
You made us ditch school,
run around with drugs
and lock a cop in a convenience store,
with what I now suspect is a dildo!
What the fuck are you looking at, Gandalf?
Oh.
You guys don't understand shit!
I have hormones flowing through my body
making me do crazy things.
Do you even know what it feels like...
...to wanna rub up against a tree
all the time?
You think you're better than us.
Not better, just more mature.
I'm into romance and grown-up shit
and you guys
are still into little kid stuff.
I don't even know why we're still friends.
Everything you like
is now canceled.
Birthdays are canceled.
Holidays are canceled.
Summers, canceled.
Winter is coming.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
No! You are no longer allowed
to call me "Daddy".
Call me "Andrew"
or "Mr. Newman" or "warden".
Underneath that cherubic face,
devil lives inside you.
I will always love you
because you are my son,
but I no longer like you.
Thorny!
I just got off the phone with Max's mom!
Did you know he skipped school
and biked to the mall by himself?
-He said that?
-He did.
Promise me you'll never do something
as stupid as that, okay?
I promise.
And then we run
across the highway,
my arm got ripped out,
and a fake woman shot out of a car.
But we still got the drugs.
But then we traded the drone for it,
and Max destroyed his house with it.
But it was only because
he wanted to marry Brixlee
and now he can't because
he's grounded for life,
and we got into a huge fight,
and the Bean Bag Boys are broke up,
and am I in trouble?
Okay, Son. Now, look,
I love a good story with a bunch of
gibberish just as much as anybody, okay?
I know you're going through
a stressful time
but it doesn't give you a reason
to tell us fibs.
I'm not fibbing.
I'm 100% sure you're fibbin' to me.
I'm not fibbing.
Okay, I think I understand
what's happening here.
You think you're losing us
and now you're worried
you're gonna lose your friends, too.
Look at me, man.
We'll always be there, right?
I mean, look, don't get me wrong...
me and your mom are not the same people
we were when we first met.
You tend to grow apart sometimes.
But it's okay.
You remember your hermit crab?
Herman? Yeah.
That's right, Herman.
And you remember why he died?
Oh, son of a...
You told me he ran away!
Technically, yes.
He ran away, but then he died.
Oh, my gosh. How?
Herman died
because hermit crabs
grow out of their shells
and they need to find
new, bigger seashells on the beach
to grow into, or they die.
And we didn't know that.
So, Herman died because of you guys?
The point is...
you and your friends
are growing and changing
and y'all need to find bigger shells.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
Okay, look, you need to blame
those pet store owners. Okay?
Because they did not give us
enough information about hermit crabs.
It's Lucas.
You scared the shit out of me.
I didn't want your parents to see my face.
Why are you even here?
I've grown a lot in the last two hours.
My parents' divorce has really changed me.
If the Bean Bag Boys don't grow together,
they'll grow apart.
I don't want that.
I don't wanna get a divorce from you.
Then you need to go to Soren's party.
You need to sneak out.
I can't, I'm grounded.
Besides, Brixlee's necklace
is still in the kiln.
Let me worry about the necklace.
And what are your parents gonna do?
Double-ground you?
Is Brixlee your forever or not?
Then you need to come with me now.
Fine, I'll go.
But I'm not apologizing to Thor.
He's not coming.
Good.
Fuck that bitch.
I'll go get my jacket.
Hey, Max.
Yeah?
Bring that dick.
You said Thor wasn't coming.
What the hell is he doing here?
I Parent-Trapped your asses.
See, now we're all in a bigger
hermit crab shell together.
It made sense when my parents said it.
So, you took the blame for us?
Yeah, I thought about what you would do
and did the opposite.
This party is gonna be an epic rager.
Okay, Sippy Cup.
Just stay out of my way, Maxi Pad.
Aw! Don't you boys look cute?
Everybody's in the basement.
I don't even wanna know
what's going on down there.
Come on in, fellas.
Hi. Hi, there.
Oh, my God. You made it.
Max, I want you to meet Brixlee.
Hi. I'm Max.
Hi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
You too.
Cool jacket.
Thank you.
I got it all by myself
with my mom.
I go shopping with my mom, too.
This is going so well.
Did you bring the necklace?
Brixlee, this is for you.
Oh, thanks! It's pretty.
They're nal.
Ooh, fancy.
I'm gonna wear this later.
Thanks, Max.
What's up, Sippy Cup?
Not much. Just got into a fight
with a bunch of men and stole a beer.
There's no way Sippy Cup
is gonna drink it.
Not only am I gonna drink it,
I'm gonna break the record.
Whoa.
I'm gonna take four sips.
Four's impossible.
Soren can't even do four.
Shut up.
Drink.
That's one.
Big deal.
That's two!
M'kay.
That's three!
This is insane.
He's gonna barf.
Somebody get him a sippy cup.
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!
That's fucking four!
Fuck!
Thor! Thor! Thor!
I'm a fuckin' alcoholic!
No way!
Four sips, badass.
Mad respect to Thor.
Eyes up here.
If you don't consent to kissing,
that's cool.
You can go play VR upstairs.
But if you're staying down here,
you better strap in
because shit's about to get real.
Hell yeah.
Let's spin a bottle.
Well, then it's a good thing
I got a bottle right here!
I'm out.
Wait, where are you going?
That was nasty.
I'm going upstairs to play VR.
If you leave, you can never come back.
Oh, no!
Brixlee...
your turn.
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, my God. This is the most
dramatic thing I've ever seen.
He's not gonna do it.
He's gonna do it.
I can't do it.
People don't change. He's still Sippy Cup.
Wait, wait! Kissy Cup.
Kissy Cup.
Kissy cup!
Kissy cup! Kissy cup!
Fuck off, Atticus! His name is Thor.
And everyone knows your mom
plagiarized her cookbook.
Thor, wait up.
I'm sorry I called you a try-hard.
Nah, you were right.
This whole time I've been trying
to be someone who I wasn't.
I got an earring...
I drank a beer...
I quit singing.
Yeah.
I guess I went a little crazy today, too.
Let's get outta here.
No. You don't wanna do that.
You're gonna stay down here
and kiss Brixlee.
Bean Bag Boys do everything together.
Not everything.
Not anymore.
Maybe those old girls were right.
Maybe we're on different paths.
Yeah.
Then what are you gonna do?
I don't know. I just know it's not this.
No way.
This is insane.
Forget spin the bottle.
Now go over there,
and kiss your future wife.
Bye.
Bye.
Brixlee...
can I kiss you?
Okay.
Cool.
Where am I?
Oh, here I am.
Lucas, I'm leaving.
You sure you don't wanna try this?
Nah, I'm good.
Wanna go to my house and play Ascension?
I don't wanna play Ascension anymore.
Then who am I gonna play with?
You'll find someone.
My face feels so tingly.
No way!
Oh, my God.
This is amazing,
I can't believe you guys are here.
This is so amazing.
Hi!
-Hi.
-Sit down.
Please no, please no. Don't kill us.
What happened?
How do you know Soren?
Is he your boyfriend?
He's my brother.
I love that piece of shit.
You guys, where's everybody else?
-Where's your friend with the sad eyes?
-Sad boy Max.
In the basement kissing.
It's an orgy down there.
And you guys aren't into that?
Aw, it's okay.
You're only in sixth grade,
you guys are gonna figure it out.
Yeah, you have your whole life for that.
No rush.
No rush. I mean...
what do you love?
Ascension, rules...
anti-drug campaigns...
grilled cheese.
I could fuck
with a grilled cheese right now.
-Guys, I'm gonna make us grilled cheese.
-Oh, yeah.
-Nice.
-That sounds so good.
What about you, sleeveless?
What are you into?
I love to sing.
Yes!
I actually skipped my audition today
for the musical
and now I can't be in it.
No.
What? You have to convince them
to let you audition.
You must, you must.
-Audition.
-Sing for us.
-No.
-Oh, my God! Sing for us!
You're a baby bird. Sing for us!
So, no grilled cheese?
- No.
- Sing for us, be our concert.
My masterpiece.
- Thank you, I was really great.
- 'Sup, Max?
I'll be right back.
-Hey! I didn't think you'd make it.
-Are you kidding?
You know I'd never miss one of your shows.
It was so cool when you stabbed that pimp.
Thank you.
Oh, sorry. Thor, this is Scout.
You were really good.
Thanks, sweetie.
I was much better in the matinee.
I'm gonna go find Cassidy.
I thought you were still grounded.
It ended yesterday. A month in the hole.
Thanks again for taking the fall.
You woulda done the same.
Well, well, well.
Look who's here. Me.
Hey!
Feels like we haven't talked in weeks!
Yeah.
Max...
my mom said she'll drop us
at frozen yogurt
if your mom will pick us up.
Great. Be there in a second, babe.
'Kay, babe.
So, how's it going with Scout?
Good. But hard. But good.
A relationship is a lot of work,
don't let anyone tell you differently.
Hey.
Lucas, you still wanna play Ascension
with me and the guys later?
I'll be there in a minute.
Classic Lucas.
Carlos and those SCAB guys seem cool.
They're cool...
but they're not the Bean Bag Boys.
Max!
All right.
I guess I should go.
Yeah, all right. Well...
Yeah.
I missed you guys.
Let's make a promise,
even if we don't hang out all the time,
we'll still always be there
for the big stuff.
Bean Bag Boys for life.
Bean Bag Boys for life.
Bean Bag Boys for life.
Wait!
There's something I have to show you.
Come up to my parents' bedroom
in three minutes.
Yo, guys, check this out!
An indoor swing?
You always have the best toys.
Yeah!
Flip that switch.
How cool is it?
Your parents love to play.
What do they do with it?
They swing on it.
-Can we go on it?
-Fuck yeah.
Thor?
What are you doing in mom and dad's room?
Get the hell out of here, Annabelle.
That swing is for sexing.
People do sex on it.
