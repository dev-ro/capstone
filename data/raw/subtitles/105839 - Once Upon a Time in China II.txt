ONCE UPON A TI ME I N CHI NA II
Master, steady!
Leaning towards the oppsite
direction and balance.
- Excuse me!
- Aunt 1 3, the train is rocking.
- How can we eat?
- You'll get used to it.
Look, the foreigners
have no problem with it.
Come and sit here.
It used to take a day
to walk to Canton.
The trees look like they are fying!
Whoops!
I don't feel well.
Foon, what's wrong?
What did you say?
Nothing. I--
My insides feel strange.
You are train sick.
Don't eat oryou'll throw up.
But I want to tryWestern food!
We both do. Right, Master?
Excuse me!
We haven't ordered yet.
We don't have to.
Everyone will have the same meal.
- Miss, the soup.
- Thankyou.
It's prepared.
How could we know it's fresh?
jesus! Thesolareclipse.
Relax. You are overreacting!
Aunt 1 3, what's happening?
We are in a tunnel.
A tunnel?
We are strong enough
to make a tunnel?
It's really amazing!
Dumbo!
Foon, it's okay to act
like this in front ofus.
-Behaveyourselfwhen you are in Canton.
-I will.
There'll be many foreigners
at the medical conference.
Don't embarrass us.
I understand, Master.
Which hand is mine?
Fei Hung, have the soup while it's hot.
Foon, you do the same.
But I can't tell which hand
is mine, Master.
Like that? I can do it.
Sir, areyou done with the soup?
I'll finish it after the rice.
Only meat? Where's the rice?
Miss, doyoustill want thesoup?
No, thanks.
Thankyou.
Fei Hung, useyour knife
and fork to cut the steak.
I know.
Alwaysso clumsy!
Don't playwith your food.
What a waste!
Sorry!
Concentrate on whatyouare doing.
Watch and learn!
- Aunt 1 3, areyou okay?
- Let me clean it foryou.
Never mind.
Here's your steak.
Don't playwith you food, Master!
It's all your fault.
Forget it. Let's eat.
Why areyou so quiet?

Why areyou so quiet?
I can't hold it anymore!
Got to--
- Foon!
- I'm sorry.
I toldyounot to eat.
- Holdon! We'llbein Cantonsoon.

Yes.
Riding in a train
is quite a challenge.
Waiter!
I want to take this to go.
I just don't want to waste it.
Here come the chicken thighs!
Giveme onepotoftea.
- Give me back my money!
- It was you who wanted to bet.
Look at the crowd!
What's on the banner?
Support the scholars' proposal!
Objection to
the Treaty ofShimonoseki!
Where's Taiwan?
Why did we give it toJapan
after the war?
Taiwan must be near the sea...
or it wouldn't be named
after a bay.
I don't even know how large it is.
We have other things
to worry about in Canton.
Let's drink.
Who cares?
Objection to the negotiation between
Li Hung Chang andJapan.
Object to the cession ofTaiwan.
How can she dress like that
in public?
Which one?
Oh, the one on the rickshaw!
Gosh! Look at her!
She's Chinese
but wears Western clothes.
- Thoseare Western clothes?
- Really weird!
Sister!
Object to the cession ofTaiwan.

He's Wong Fei Hung,
that famous martial artist!
I'll kickyou to death.

You'll hurt him.
Okay, that's enough.
Cross fist!
Thankyou, thankyou.
Master!
-Aunt 13, areyouallright?

You camejust in time.
What's this? It smells sweet.
She sniffed the sleeping powder.

- Yes.
Take care ofAunt 13.
Aunt 1 3.
Protected by the divine power...
How dareyou claim yourself
messenger ofGod...
and bringjustice to earth.
Aunt 13, wake up!
Aunt 1 3!
Foon, carry her back to the inn.
Foon!
What areyou waiting for?
He's one ofthe best 1 0
martial artists in Canton.
Get lost!
What's he doing?
Don't touch it, MasterWong.
It's evil.
Get lost!
I want to learn
martial arts from you.
Goaway!Don'tfollowme.
Fei Hung!
You're awake.
You passed out because of
the sleeping powder.
- Did you carry me back here?
- No.
Foon did.
Whywas he carried me back?
He's outside
brewingmedicine foryou.
Drink theherbalmedicine
andgetsomerest.
- Master Wong.
- Coming.
There are rough types here.
Don't go out alone.
Rest a while. Don't worry.
I'm fine!
I can interpret foryou at
the medical conference tomorrow.
Let's talk about that later.
Drink the medicine first.
- Sorry for the interruption.
- Never mind.
You woke up already?
It was--
It was you who carried me back.
Right.
Be careful. Themedicineishot.
Mr. Mak,
doyou want to talk to me?
I asked my employee
to buy these clothes.
Please askyour friend
to wear them.
It's very kind ofyou.
Don't mention it.
White Lotus is powerful here...
and they hate foreigners.
Since we are old friends,
I'll be frankwith you.
The way she dresses
will get herselfinto trouble.
I know whatyou mean.
How much do I oweyou?
- Don't worry about it.
- Thankyou very much.
Please ask her to change.
IfIknewit wassoboring,
I wouldnotcome.
Anotherone.
I wonder who willbe thenextone?
justgetitover with.
Dr. Wong, it's your turn.
- Foon, our turn.
- I'll letyou through.
- We'll go together.
- Please don't, Master.
Thankyou.
Gentlemen, my topic today
is Chinese Acupuncture--
Quite?
He wants us to talk louder.
A human head contains
365 acupuncture points.
Wasn't that loud enough?
That's not what he meant.
Mr. Wong, let me interpret foryou.
- Excuse me. You are...
- My name is Sun Yat Sen.
Mr. Sun,
I really appreciateyour help.
- Don't mention it.
- Thankyou.
Gold, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth
represent five organs ofhuman body.
They form a network...
and acupuncture can control
human senses.
Mr. Wong, Dr. Thomson
doesn't quite understand acupuncture.
He demonstrated the Western
medical studies about the refex action.
It's simple. I can put needles on
his acupuncture points...
so that his leg can't move.
You are not going to use
the needles on me, right?
Mr. Sun, ask him to test
ifhe can still move his leg.
White Lotus comes to earth...
relieves us fromsuffering.
Killall the foreigners
andwe'lllive inpeace.
Master!
The White Lotus Sect again!
Master, I can't move!
I've been hit by an arrow!
I am doomed.
Why does everyone have to
treat me like an easy target?
- Mr. Sun, your bag.
- Forget it!
All the foreign devilsaregone.
Let'sgoback to theshrine.
- Areyou okay?
- I'm fine.
Here's you bag, Mr. Sun.
Mr. Wong...
we should exchange some ideas
when we have a chance.
China needs more men likeyou.
Thankyou for the compliment.
Good-bye.
The White Lotus Sect
is a group oflawless fighters.
Master, Aunt 1 3
is alone in the inn!
Why didn'tyou tell me earlier?
The White LotusSect?
Come out!
Fei Hung?
Master, what's the matter?
Nothing. Let's go.
Butyou have turned pale.
There must be something wrong.
It was only her changing--
nothing special!
- Mind your own business.
- Butyou have seen it all!
That blind man
makes too much noise.
- Tell him to shut up.
- Get away.
Thankyou.
Commander.
This is our only contact
with the outside world.
- Doyour best to protect it.
- Yes, sir.
Commander.
Many poor people live
in Northgate.
They could get hurt.
Try to drive the White Lotus
into Eastgate.
Yes, sir.
Sir, ifthe riot continues...
we might be outnumbered.
Burn down Telegraph House.
Master.
It's time for dinner.
I have bought a delicious dish
forAunt 1 3.
- The tasty meat?
- Yeah.
- It's really tasty!
- What's tasty meat?
Haven'tyou told Aunt 1 3
what that is?
Don'tyou know?
Aunt 1 3, doyou like dogs?
Sure, dogs are man's best friend.
I like dogs more than cats.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Let's eat.
People like dogs in different ways.
They went that way.
Canton is in chaos.
Foon, pack our things after dinner.
We'll leave tomorrow morning...
and take the train back to Fo Shan.
Yes, Master.
Then you'd better
eat well tonight....
sinceyou might get train sick
like last time.
I want to talk toyou
afteryou are done with the dog meat.
You want to talk to me?
What did youjust say?
Dog meat?
Is this really dog meat?
Yes.
Yes, Master loves dogs
likeyou do.
Aunt 1 3, I want to
teach you martial arts.
Why do I have to learn that?
Our country is in turmoil.
You'll need it for self-defense.
Basic Technique has 36 postures.
Advanced Technique has 72 postures.
Both are Arrest Techniques.
Fei Hung!
Do I have to remember all this?
Just listen and try to
get the basic idea.
Remember, for punches,
grab the top ofthe arms.
For kicks,
block from underneath.
What ifsomeone comes
with a knife?
I'll teach you how to strike back
with your bare hands.
Look,
this is the single-handed posture.
And this is the two-handed posture.
Carrying a gun would be
much easier and safer.
Quiet!
I shouldn'tyell atyou.
But this is how I teach my students.
I'm fine. Let's continue.
Okay.
The first posture.
Hold my head.
Pay attention!
Ifhe holds your head,
grab his hand, then twist.
- Holds the head, grab the hand...
- Then twist.
Twist.
Try again.
Holds the head,
grab the hand, then twist.
The second posture.
Grab throat.
Here, grab my throat,
harder.
Grab the throat,
bend down, then move away.
Aunt 1 3.
Watch out!
Wereyou daydreaming?
I was practicing
the postures in my head.
Try it once more.
The first stance.
Hold the head.
And?
Attack him.
Areyou okay?
I'd rather fight with you
than againstyou!
Sir, we have received a telegram
from Hong Kong.
We have no time for that now.
According to the telegram,
an uprising will take place in Canton.
Here's the telegram.
Sir, another telegram
from Hong Kong.
This is an emergency.
Guard Telegraph House.
- I'll have to speak to the governor.
- Yes, sir.
Your Excellency.
You know the ball is held by
the British Consul.
What's so urgent?
Our agent in Hong Kong had sent
two telegrams today.
He reports that some people there
have formed a secret society...
and want to ship weapons to Canton.
They are planning an uprising.
Uprising?
- Is it the White Lotus Sect?
- No.
The leader is called Sun Yat Sen.
Sun Yat Sen?
Who's this Sun Yat Sen?
Your Excellency, he's the one
who founded the Agricultural Society.
He's a doctorwho likes to
give speeches...
and criticize government
all the time.
He promotes democracy...
and even says that
China should be a republic.
How can a doctor
rise in rebellion?
- Your Excellency--
- Do we have enough men?
Our army has to
deal with those boxers...
so we are undermanned.
Also the government is disputing
with France...
at the northern border.
I believe there'll be a war soon.
I am afraid the government
won't dispatch forces here.
We are getting the British
on our side.
That should keep
other foreigners at bay.
Put the army and navy
on the alert!
And extra men at ports and stations
till we find Sun Yat Sen.
As for that society--
Agricultural Society.
Who else is involved
with Sun Yat Sen?
Someone called Luk Ho Dung
is the treasurer.
Governor.
Should we bring him in
for questioning?
Yes, let's find out about him.
Yes, sir.
- Sir.
- I'm not going.
Sir.
Hey, you! Wake him up.
Tell him it's not his day off.
Did you spend all night
at the brothel? Get up.
Aunt 1 3, be careful.
Take it easy.
- Foon, what areyou doing?
- She twisted her ankle.
How? She was fine last night.
When did this happen?
I had no idea till I woke up
this morning. I could hardlywalk.
Foon offered to carry me
when he found out.
Foon.
Master, I don't mind.
Good. Then I'll carry her,
you take the luggage.
It really hurts.
I always carry everything.
Nowyou want myjob.
It's not fair.
Cashier.
Yes, may I helpyou?
We'd like to check out.
- What areyou doing?
- Boss.
Good morning, MasterWong.
We are leaving.
Finally, thank God.
No-- I mean, take care.
Sorry for the trouble.
Ifyou are ever--
Fei Hung, look!
What happened?
- He's injured.
- What happened?
The White Lotus
burnt down the Language School.
- Take him to the doctor.
- What's this language school?
It provides
foreign language education.
My God! The students are there!
Mr. Mak,
where's the Language School?
To the left ofthe farmer's market.
- Don't go there!
- Aunt 1 3.
- Master, where's she going?
- Why did she lie to me?
Her ankle is fine.
Master, it was her idea.
Wait for me.
'' Language School''
'' Language School''
Is this the place?
Master, wait for me!
- What is it?
- It's a human skin!
I was telling the truth.
Master!
The students!
Thank God!
They've been hiding.
What's going on?
- Let me look.
- What's in there?
They are gone now.
Don't worry.
I'm scared.
Theywere mean to us.
- That's right!
- They stormed in and beat us.
MasterWong,
how comeyou are still here?
And why'd you bring
all the kids with you?
They are students
from the Language School.
They can't stay here. Ifthe fighters
come for them, I'm finished.
I don't know any one ofthem.
Not to mention
they learn foreign languages.
Why don'tyou take them
to City Hall?
Please help them!
MasterWong,
I can't fight likeyou.
This inn is all I have
to support my family.
- Ifanything happened, I--
- I'll help!
- Mr. Mak.
- He passed out.
Get up, Mr. Mak.
You can't force him,
even ifyou are Wong Fei Hung.
Ifhe dies,
it will be all your fault.
We can't force things to happen.
Let's go.
Let's send the students
home first.
- Where doyou live, kids?
- I'm from the Guangxi Province.
Guangxi Province.
I'm also from the Guangxi Province.
I'm from the Fujian Province.
This one is from Fujian.
These two are from Guangxi.
I think they all come from
different provinces.
Any ofyou live in Canton?
I live at Northgate.
So does he.
I live at Shamian.
So do I.
I think I live near Eastgate.
Anyone else live around here?
I came here by train.
I don't rememberwhere I live.
Let's take these two home first.
The rest will go with us.
- Kid, get on my shoulders.
- By the way...
buy some rice stuffing,
in case they get hungry.
Waiter, give me 20 rice stuffings.
Come, I'll carryyou.
Sir.
- How can I helpyou?
- You must be the owner.
Have the students from
the Language School been here?
Students? No, you have come
to the wrong place.
Wait!
Has anybody seen the students?
Don't be silly.
This is a restaurant.
They might have been kidnapped.

Get the lucky charm.
Give me one.

and you will be rewarded.
Donate the money now.
It brings you peace.
Sure.
The moreyou get,

Hurry! We have to get going.
Be quiet.
Areyou bleeding?
Not me. It's his.
He's seriously injured.
We can't stay here.
I'll go ask the City Hall
to take the students in.
Stay here and wait for me.
Foon.
Help treat the kid's wound.
I am not finished yet.
Don't be naughty.
Come back here.
Foon, you smell.
- You have peed on me.
- I told you I wasn't doneyet.
Commander, Wong Fei Hung
is here to seeyou.
Master Wong,
please waithere.
Your Excellency.
Sir.
No wonderyou are
the chieftrainer ofthe local militia.
Thankyou foryour compliment.
I wasjust trying to learn from you.
The reputation ofyour Shao Lin
stick fight is well deserved.
Maybeyou can teach me
some other time.
Have some wine!
Thankyou.
There's nothing special
about his stick fight.
That pole didn't move at all
and people call him '' Kung Fu Master''.
I think it's an exaggeration.
Our men are out
protecting foreigners.
It may not be safe here.
Ifthe students stay here,
those fighters will come for them.
Sir.
I know ourjob is to serve
and to protect the civilians.
Unfortunately, I am unable to...
cope with the situation
without help.
I feel so ashamed.
Foon.
Come over here.
Let me through.
Don't get in his way.
He's still bleeding.
Master isn't backyet.
What shall we do?
- He's not moving at all.
- Why doesn't he move?
It's Mozart.
Not too tight? He's bleeding.
No, I mean the music.
There must be
a foreign consulate nearby.
A foreign consulate?
Beware offiire
Beware ofburglary
Aunt 1 3? Foon?
- I need to pee.
- Can'tyou hold it?
It's bad for my kidneys.
So what?
They are rotten anyway.
Don't move!
Stop!
Where did you fighters take
the women and kids?
I am not a fighter.
My kids are in bed now.
And mywoman ran away
with another man.
- What?
- Master.
Foon, where haveyou been?
Aunt 1 3 took the kids
to a safe place.
Really?
Why areyou holding
a White Lotus lantern?
We thought it could
bring us good luck.
But it only brought the opposite.
Can we go now?
- Go!
- Let's go.
Hurry up.
Foon, take me to that place.
How can you not remember me?
How can you not remember me?
I was here earlierwith
a group ofkids.
And a beautiful lady too.
But I left for my master.
Doyou remember?
You are wasting my time.
What's wrong?
Did Aunt 1 3 bring those kids here?
Yes. He did let us in,
but now he refuses to do so.
- Aunt 1 3!
- Aunt 1 3!
I am here with Master.
Master, he asked us
to stand straight.
That's what I heard.
Aunt 1 3!
We are waiting at the front gate.
They opened the gate, Master.
What's that for?
Foon, stay calm.
- You misunderstood us.
- Foon, explain to them.
- I did!
- Putyour guns away.
- What did you say?
- Why can'tyou understand?
Stop.
Leave this to me.
I'm Luk Ho Dung.
And you are...
Wong Fei Hung from Fo Shan.
Wong Fei Hung.
You saved those students.
That's right.
They are all inside.
- But theywon't let us in.
- It's only a mistake.
Stand back!
Sergeant.
Mr. Luk.
Why do foreigners crucify
their god?
It speaks to something
in their souls.
When we areyoung,
we learn the myths.
And we interpret them
as we get older.
After all, we see
they arejust myths.
Why doyou always look
atyourwatch?
Waiting for someone?
My friend always does it,
so I copy him.
He says time is valuable.
We Chinese waste a lot oftime.
I can't read those foreign watches.
I'll never keep good time.
Don't come down.
Don't be afraid.
Foon, take them upstairs.
They are foreign merchants
and their families.
And they are hiding
from the White Lotus Sect.
- They are looking for doctors.
- Doctors? Then they need Master.
They are looking for doctors.
They don't want Chinese doctors.
Dr. Sun.
Mr. Wong.
- This is--
- I know.
He's the friend that I mentioned.
Burn it down!
White Lotus is making trouble again.
Luk.
Which ofthese watches is right?
Sun, yourwatch is fast.
Mine can't keep up with yours.
Stopjoking.
Let's go see the patients.
Foon, I never thought
time was so important.
I didn't thinkyou'd understand.
Burn the evil foreigners.
Stop them from endangering the world.
And burn this evil woman too.
She makes lightning bolts.
Aunt 1 3.
Oh, no!
They are taking her soul.
Ifthey are so powerful,
how come they lost?
They cannot take her soul.
It'sjust a superstition.
Don't worry about it. Relax.
I am afraid she'll vomit.
She's not train sick.
Dr. Sun, what doyou suggest?
Luk, askWong Fei Hung in.
Areyou feeling better?
Mr. Wong, Sun would likeyou
to go in and help a patient.
- Where's he?
- Over there.
Take me there.
He said thankyou.
He has never seen
anything like this.
Don't say that.
Saving lives is crucial.
- What's the matter?
- Follow me. Don't go anywhere.
I won't leaveyou.
Those kids.
Watch out, Sun! Get down!
The soldiers have occupied
Telegraph House.
We have lost contact
with Hong Kong.
Shall we proceed
with our plan for revolution?
It's too risky.
We must disperse our men for a while.
We can each tell some.
Our only linkwith the outside
is the telex at the consulate.
Luk, you know
how to send a telex.
Stay here and keep contact
with the outside world.
Sun, I--
I have arranged a safe hideout
foryour family.
I'm going back to Yuan Kong Villa now,
then to the wedding party.
Ifyou don't hear anything from me...
leave for Hong Kong
early tomorrow morning.
In order to prevent
time discrepancy...
take mywatch with you.
Ifwe fail...
you should keep it.
I will.
- Where areyou going, Dr. ?
- I've got things to take care of.
- I'll walkyou out. It's dangerous.
- Thankyou.
- Don't come with us.
- Fei Hung, be careful!
Protected by the divine power.
Kill the evil foreigners!
Dr. Sun.
How will you get out?
It's easier to save men
than their country.
Looks like
we can't save so many people.
Get away--
Kick them out!
Leave now. Hurry.
Mr. Wong, good-bye.
Sir, wejust want
to expel the foreigners.
The White Lotus won't kill
our own people.
I'm glad to hearyou say that.
Let our government
negotiate with the foreigners.
Were they more capable, China would not
have ceded so many territories.
That's right!
It's bullshit.
Ifyou keep making trouble here,
I'll arrestyou all!
Take the altar away.
Let's search this place.
Luk is hiding here.
Mr. Luk.
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
Cut all the wires.
Isolate them from the outside world.
All is fair in war.
We are now at war.
We have no choice.
But, sir--
I know.Just do it.
Yes, sir.
Follow the Commander's orders.
Go!
They protect the rebels
because theywant to restrain us.
Pull it up.
Now is the time.
Okay.
Sinceyou all have guts,
follow me.
Remember, don't move
afteryou pose the stance.
This is called the Kneebend.
When you pose the stance,
unlimited strength will come.
Walk the Unicorn Steps,
then Kneebend.
Hold the head,
grab the hands and twist.
Watch carefully.
Return to the original position.
One more.
Hang on! Pose for two hours.
Foon!
Doyou know the posture
I just practiced?
- Arrest Technique?
- Yes, I have learned a little bit.
But I need to refresh my memory.
That's easy.
I'll attack, and you counterattack.
Watch out!
Should we try again?
Maybe we need to change places.
What areyou doing?
Why areyou holding Aunt 1 3?
I'm teaching her
the Arrest Technique.
Does she need you to teach her?
I can teach her!
It's disrespectful foryou
to hold her like this.
Go downstairs!
Kneebend for halfan hour.
- I--
- Go downstairs!
Stop looking!
Kneebend!
I'm going, Master.
What areyou doing?
- Kneebend!
- Doyou think that's the Kneebend?
Don't be mad at him.
I asked him to teach me.
You did?
Why not ask him to come up?
Go ahead.
Punish me for teaching her
Arrest Technique.
What ifI teach herwrestling?
These foreigners are really lazy.
Ifthe White Lotus came,
you'd be dead meat.
Trying to scare me?
Foreign devil.
Let's wait for her to come down.
Mr. Luk.
Haveyou seen Foon?
- White Lotus?
- Help!
The fighters are here!
Foreign devil.
They reallywant to kill us!
The wind and fire together.
Kill all the foreigners.
The White Lotus, savior ofthe world.
Expel all the devils!
You hide first.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Watch out!
- Mr. Luk.
- Yes.
Sir.
Let's wait and watch.
You'll be dead meat!
Kneebend.
Master.
Foon, you help me
deal with these guys.
I'll go and get those two horses.
Get down.
Wanna leave?
Foon, tie them up.
See ifthere are
any other fighters around.
Go and arrest them.
- Let's go.
- Yes.
Arrest the fighters!
Leave quickly.
What areyou looking at?
Go back inside.
They're fighting outside.
Sir.
Fei Hung,
Commander killed the consular.
Search everywhere.
Tell Sun Yat Sen to run for his life.
Fei Hung...
I knowyou treat me likeyour aunt.
But I treatyou
like the man in my heart.
Ifwe miss each other,
come back and look for me.
It's time to go.
No matterwhat,
we have to make it through tonight...
soyou can see
the shining sun tomorrow.
Understand?
Foon, you'll be the decoy.
Go and distract the soldiers.
And get the name list
from the market.
- I will.
- Foon, take this watch.
Go to the pier
at 7:00 in the morning.
Get the name list back.
Siu-qun.
You called my name?
It's the first timeyou called my name.
Who areyou?
Sir, I'm the interpreter
ofthe consulate.
Go.
Foon, go now.
Mr. Luk.
- Luk? Go after him.
- Go after him.
Commander.
Wong Fei Hung.
We must capture the fighter's leader,
so the riot will stop.
I'll go to the shrine
and eradicate them.
Good! Who's that?
- Foon.
- Master.
- Greet the Commander.
- Sir.
He was beaten up
by the White Lotus.
Sir, I don't know
what will happen to me.
Please take care ofthe kids for me.
Okay, I promiseyou.
Thankyou.

We are protected by the divine power.

Stop this superstitious nonsense.

Ifyou move, I'll shoot.
Let's see who will die!
Everyone step aside.
I'm not afraid ofthe gun.

how can our country be saved?
Where can we go?
We have no place to go.
Get them!

on the ground.
What a crook!
Wong Fei Hung,
how dareyou insult the gods?
- God bless me!
- He'd be blind to bless you.
Solar Explosion!
Kung, the show is over.
You claimed to bring peace to the world,
butyou brought violent death.
I'll challengeyour so-called
divine power.
- No one can stop me!
- I can!
- Arrest Technique?
- Yes.

Gods are useless.
You must rely on yourself.
My body is protected
by the divine power.

How could this be? Why?
Let's go.
What time is it?
I can't read.
It's useless to give this to me.
Master!
Great. We meet again.
It's 6:00 now.
We still have time.
- Where's the name list?
- Name list?
Oh, no! My mind was
on distracting the soldiers.
- And I forgot the list.
- Why areyou so careless?
- I have to go to the market.
- Can you make it?
I have to get it.
It's a matter oflife and death.
Let's go.
Luk, why doyou still want
to go to the market?
I must take the name list back.
The ship leaves in 30 minutes.
We have to meet Sun
at the pier on time.
Wait here.
Foon, see if Luk is readyyet.
I'll stay here on guard.
- Can I do something to help?
- I've got it. Let's go.
Soldiers are coming. Hide.
- MasterWong, this way.

Foon, you go first.
Luk, hang in there.
This way, Master.
Freeze!
There's a way out here.
Areyou all right?
I can't walk anymore.
Leave me here.
Let me helpyou.
This list is extremely important.
Don't let the government have it,
or many people will get killed.
Take me over there.
Don't burn this cloth.
Promise meyou'll bring this
to Sun personally.
Tell him I died for the revolution.
He must live for the revolution.
Blood. They're in here.

Commander?
We meet again.

Damn! It's dead end.
There's no way out.
What time is it?
I can't tell the time,
but it's getting bright.
''Canton To Tong Ka Bay''

He wants to wait for Luk.
