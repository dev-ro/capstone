THIS IS THE STORY OF MY LIFE.
My father, back then,
his friends...
and mainly his family...
they thought he was
just imagining things.
They said he was a dreamer.
They used to call
my father crazy.
But we were the crazy ones.
He was the one who was right.
BASED ON A TRUE STORY
Is it working?
Hey, Helena!
Helena!
Darn it!
Francisco.
-Francisco.
-Darn it, Helena.
Now I've got it working,
let me listen!
Francisco...
I'm pregnant.
Francisco, give
the boy's ears a rest.
But Mirosmar adores music!
Can't you tell?
Give me him.
We'll have two boys
and they'll sing.
They'll form a duo.
A duo of two.
Attention! Cut off warning.
Consumers from Anapolis City
and region...
be informed that the power
will be cut off...
How about Marlene?
How about Emanoel?
Wellington.
Ouch! Francisco!
Ouch!
-Let's go, Ze!
-It hurts!
Wait, wait!
Stop, Jose!
One more boy!
Walter!
Turn that radio down! We can't
even get any peace for meals.
-Oh, mom!
-Leave it be, Helena!
You wanted a country duo
and ended up with a whole choir.
Turn the radio up, dad.
Who owns the place?
Eat up, Emanoel.
Eat up your corn.
TWO SONS OF FRANCISCO STORY
OF ZEZE DI CAMARGO E LUCIANO
SANT'ANA SOUVENIR
Let's take the picture, mom!
Mom, I'm going to sing
at that thing later on.
If you do a good job,
I'll give you a prize.
Promise!
Go on, son!
What a sweet kiss
She has
Since I kissed her
I've loved no other
What a sweet little kiss
She brought from afar
My God! We've got a hell
of a long way to go!
What did you expect, that he'd
be born a songbird?
-Did you like it, dad?
-Of course not, son.
Your voice is no good.
You still need to practice.
Nonsense, son.
Your father's talking nonsense.
Go get your prize, go on.
I don't want it, mom.
Come on.
Here, son.
All right.
He's only a boy, Francisco.
A son of mine has to make something
of his life, Helena.
What if he has no talent for
music? What will we do with him?
Forget it, Francisco.
Waste his life hoeing
other people's fields?
School?
For the children, dad.
But school, Helena?
It takes all day to walk
from here to the village, dad.
But this house is still mine!
School, for what?
To become bums?
A son of mine has to make something
of his life, dad!
God Almighty, for crying out loud!
With no school,
the children have no future.
No way! Too many of them,
too many kids!
We can't bring
all the kids here.
There's more than fifteen.
They need a school!
Mr. Mayor...
studying is mandatory by law.
I heard it on the radio.
You're the boss.
-Who wants a notebook?
-I do!
Wait!
Who wants a yellow one?
Go on in.
And now another hit from Goias.
Stop, son, for God's sake!
No one can stand that harmonica
all day long!
Go do something nice
and quiet, go on.
Everybody to bed!
Go to bed.
Go on!
You've got the knack, boy.
Now I want you to play
like Celinho, on the accordion.
Accordion?
Form a duo with your brother.
This pig's too small.
It was my father's.
I'll trade it
for both of them.
Francisco is really crazy.
Mirosmar!
Take it, it's yours.
What about me?
I'd rather have a soccer ball.
A real ball.
-Dad!
-Leave him alone, leave him be!
The rooster.
That's how you've go to do it.
Like the rooster.
You've got to sing every day
in the morning and your voices...
-will be great. Open your mouth.
-Hey, dad!
Open your mouth, son!
Swallow! There.
Mirosmar, open your mouth!
Swallow, son. That's it.
Swallow, swallow.
That's right, son, good.
Like a singer!
-Hi, Grandad!
-Hi, Grandad!
-Howdy.
-Careful!
-Hello, dad.
-Howdy.
-Hi, Grandpa!
-Howdy.
Where the devil did he get
a concertina, Helena?
At the store, dad.
Swapped the entire
crop for it, I bet!
-Instead of paying the rent.
-Don't start, dad.
Folks are right when they say.
Francisco is downright crazy!
Beg your pardon.
I'm Francisco. My son has
to learn the accordion.
Couldn't you give him
some tips?
-Now? Not a chance!
-Just a note or two. He's good.
That's him.
He can't even
hold the instrument.
Sorry, I've got
work to do.
Hey, you!
Come here!
Come!
-I can't play yet.
-Can't play?
Who's heard of someone with such
a fine instrument who can't play?
Sit down, come on!
Listen here, I want you
to listen carefully.
I'll only teach this once.
Understand?
Go on.
Opening and closing the bellows.
Eat.
Come on, son.
Go on, son.
That's it.
You. That's it.
-Good.
...a sincere and cordial...
Camargo and Camarguinho.
Camargo and Camarguinho.
There's the microphone.
The audience is out there.
You come out...
speak, then bow.
Thank the audience.
Go on, that's it.
Camargo and Camarguinho,
come on.
Dear audience...
please cordially accept...
Not cordial! Say it again.
Pay attention, Camarguinho.
Come on, pay attention!
Dear audience...
please kindly accept the...
Better do it again.
-The day I left home.
-I start!
The day I left home
My mother said to me
Son, come here
She caressed my hair
Looked me in the eye
And said
Wherever you go, I follow
In my thoughts wherever you are
In my prayers I'll ask God
To light your way
I know she never understood
My reasons for parting
But she knows when sons grow up
They become birds and want to fly
Pirenopolis is a famous town
Nowadays
-Pirenopolis...
-Hold it! Ready!
Pirenopolis is a famous town
Nowadays
It has electricity, telephone
A bridge and sidewalks
Pirenopolis is a famous town
Nowadays
It has electricity, telephone
A bridge and sidewalks
The mayor working hard
Building and renovating
Bringing joy and prosperity
To this fine town
Nelito Jayme, the people's Mayor.
Dear audience...
please kindly accept...
a sincere and cordial...
-Good afternoon from Camargo...
-And from Camarguinho.
-What's that, dad?
-This here is our chance, son.
This here will pay
your Grandfather.
Lovely song by Uncle Ademir!
We're going to be on the radio!
-On the radio?
-We're going be on that?
Here.
It's hard, dad.
I don't understand.
Right, let's see.
-Lovely land.
-Lovely land...
-of great wealth.
-Great wealth.
-Long live our...
-Nature.
-Nation's nature.
-Nation.
What's nation, dad?
Let's just read on, son.
Look! What's that?
-It's the Army, son.
-Army?
Yes.
Now 28 have been wounded
in the clash...
between the Army and students
in Brasilia.
And in just a minute,
Camargo and Camarguinho.
The greatest country music duo
in the Pirenopolis region!
Right after these commercials!
Where are the kids
from Pirenopolis?
Come on in.
-My pleasure.
-How are you?
Francisco Camargo,
the boys' father.
Can we hear a bit of the song
before it goes on air?
No instruments,
just to hear your voices.
Lovely land of great wealth
Long live our nation's nature
Which is now living
In such confusion
Where is the hope of a people
Who toil night and day?
Where are their celebrations
And their joy?
Long live the armed forces
And their tyranny
-Long live...
-No! Wait a minute! Stop!
"Long live the armed forces
and their tyranny?"
We'll get everyone arrested!
If the censors hear that
it'll be the end of my show!
But what's wrong
with the boys' song?
What's wrong
with the boys' song?
The president of Brazil is
a military general, didn't you know?
Are you crazy, or what?
Crazy!
Don't be sad, dad.
How were we to know...
that such a fine word
would offend him? Tyranny!
Things aren't going well
around here, Francisco.
My father's been here.
He came to collect the rent.
I'm worried, Francisco.
He wants the land back,
Francisco.
You can trust me, Helena.
That's where
the boys' future lies.
Come on, Helena!
This land was never ours anyway.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
-Did you get everything?
-Yes. Are the kids there?
-Don't cry, son.
-Everybody close. Don't cry, son.
Everybody close.
The kids there, come here!
-Hold each others' hands.
-Listen to your father.
Careful, let's go.
Everybody close!
Go after.
Do you think that's it?
Is it this one, dad?
It's here. This is it.
Let's get in.
Look. Look here.
See!
At home.
Look, look, look.
Faster!
On, off, on.
See!
What do you think you're doing?
What a mess!
Do it properly or you won't
get paid a cent!
Unfortunately,
I have bad news.
Your son has had
a serious illness.
Polio.
He'll never walk again.
You took so long,
it's raining so hard!
What about the groceries?
You're all wet.
The guy at the store said
he doesn't sell on credit, mom.
Don't worry, your father will go
and speak to him.
Let's change your dress,
it's soaked, come on.
Change that shirt, Emival.
It's soaked!
I'm hungry.
Lie down for a while,
you won't feel so hungry.
-Emival, come with me.
-What for?
Come on!
Hey you, get out of here!
I don't want any noise here.
Get lost!
Can you play that, squirt?
Yeah.
Then play a little,
I want to hear.
The day I left home
My mother said to me
Son, come here
She caressed my hair
Looked me in the eye
And said
Wherever you go I follow
In my thoughts wherever you are
In my prayers I'll ask God
To light your way
I know she never understood
My reasons for parting
But she knows when sons grow up
They become birds and want to fly
I'd really like to have stayed
But my fate decided otherwise
My mother watched in the doorway
Blessing me and crying as I left
That day my mother told me
Of the ways of the world
As if she knew
Each step along the way
Without ever leaving my father's side
In that small town
She told me
Son, may God be with you
For this whole world is yours
I know she never understood
My reasons for parting
But she knew when sons grow up
They become birds and want to fly
I'd really like to have stayed
But my fate decided otherwise
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...
Look, dad! Money!
Here, dad!
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.
I'm Francisco's son,
from number 32.
What was your name again?
My name is Camargo. And this
is Camarguinho, my brother.
-Camargo and Camarguinho.
-Can I help you?
-What are you to these boys?
-Their father.
My pleasure. My name is Miranda.
I'm an agent.
I handle country music duos!
Join me for some coffee?
This way.
They're a guaranteed hit.
No doubt about it.
-Give me two coffees!
-Two coffees for us.
If I had two sons like that,
I'd be rolling in cash.
Besides the joy of their music.
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Helena.
Mr. Miranda is an agent and thinks
our boys have what it takes.
Congratulations, Mrs. Helena.
Your sons are country
whippoorwills! Magnificent!
Have a seat?
Coffee.
Thank you kindly, Mrs. Helena.
Mr. Miranda is going to take the
boys all over the area to play.
Keep an eye on them
while we work.
-All over the area?
-Yes, all over Brazil.
-They boys are going to be famous.
-And they'll make a lot of money.
A lot of money!
Mrs. Helena, can I
be honest with you?
Bus stations are
very dangerous places.
And not a place
for such talent!
I can see these boys
shining throughout the land.
Camargo, Camarguinho,
Camarguinho, Camarguinho...
Camargo, Camarguinho,
Camarguinho, Camarguinho...
Camargo, Camarguinho,
Camarguinho, Camarguinho...
It's Camargo and Camarguinho,
the Country Whippoorwills!
Let's hit the road.
Nice poster.
Turned out great!
I'm not going, I don't want to.
-See you soon.
-Have a good trip!
Bye dad.
You be careful.
Don't worry, kid. Next week
at the latest, we'll be back.
Rest assured, Mrs. Helena,
with me they have God on their side.
Go on, son.
Come on, son.
Come on, son, get in.
Watch your foot. There.
Bye, son, see you.
Take care!
-Bye!
-Take care!
-I don't want to go.
-Enough of that. Enough!
May God be with you!
Come on, let's rehearse,
let's rehearse!
"Country Boy's Lament", come on!
In these plain verses
My beauty, my love
That's it!
I'm hungry!
Get out.
Go on ahead, singing.
Look happy, come on! Go!
Go on!
How touching!
A round of applause!
Wonderful!
That's music for you!
The rest is amateur stuff.
Wonderful!
Son, can you play
"Country Boy's Lament"?
It's the story of my life.
In these plain verses
My beauty, my love
For you I wish to sing
My suffering and pain
I'm like the whippoorwill
That sings so sadly
From the branch where it sits
With this guitar
I truly sing and cry out
Each lament
Is my yearning
I was born in those hills
In a lowly little shack
All full of holes
Letting the moonlight
Shine in
When nightfall comes
Hey, come here, kids!
I'll buy you lunch.
Not even a letter.
That's just how it is, Helena.
It takes a while.
I thought Miranda said one week?
In these plain verses
My beauty, my love
For I wish to sing
My suffering and pain
I'm like the whippoorwill
That sings so sadly
From the branch where it sits
With this guitar
I truly sing and cry out
Each lament
Is my yearning
I was born in those hills
In a lowly little shack
All full of holes
Letting the moonlight
Shine in
Beautiful! Perfect!
-When nightfall comes
-Go get dressed for the show.
The birds in the bush
Start making noise
Downstairs in an hour,
you hear Emival?
Look, Emival.
When are we going back home?
Looking great!
We're late! Where is he?
He should be here by now!
-He's upstairs getting ready.
-Emival's always late! Unbearable!
I'm ready!
You're ready but you deserve
a good beating!
Let me go! Let go!
-You have to listen to me!
-You're not my father!
-It's been four months, Francisco!
-Calm down, Helena. Miranda...
That man disappeared
with our sons!
Can't you put two and two
together?
-You think...
-If anything happens...
to those boys,
it'll be your fault.
Because you must be crazy,
Francisco!
I want my sons back, Francisco!
I want my two boys!
Dad!
Helena.
Dad!
Dad!
-Oh, my son!
-My son!
Are you all right?
My boy, my son!
Francisco!
How's dear old Dad?
It's over! This whole thing
stops right here!
What do you mean, Francisco?
We're doing a great job!
-They're my sons!
-I know. They're happy.
Just ask Mirosmar...
if he wants to stay with me.
Dad, we've got so many shows
to do, and our things...
Your things are inside!
If you go with him,
you're never coming back!
And everything I invested in them?
Doesn't that count for anything?
"Invested in them?"
Get in! Get in!
The bastard isn't worth
the food he eats!
Go on, get in!
METROPOLITANA RADIO
THE VOICE OF GOIANIA
Two hours, three hours, four hours
in this line! In this sun!
It's so hot, dad. Let's go home!
-Greetings, my old friend!
-My friend Miranda.
So how goes the musical
extravaganza?
That blonde friend of yours
sent her regards.
I brought Zenito. The boy
has a spectacular voice!
A songbird from Goianesia.
-I'd like you to hear him.
-Ok, come on.
That's all for today, folks!
Time's up!
What are you talking about?!
Standing in line all day long!
You can't do this!
You!
Hey you!
I admit I was wrong, Francisco.
Everyone makes mistakes in life.
A year ago I set up an office.
But to be perfectly honest...
there's not talent around
like these boys!
Here's my card.
You don't have to answer right now.
There's no rush.
But think of their future.
Come on!
I saw Miranda today.
He said he was sorry.
-Been trying for over a year...
-Enough, Francisco!
Then tell your son
he'll be a janitor!
Is that what you want? Tell him.
He'll be a janitor! Tell him!
Which one are you, Mr. Miranda?
I'm the one over on the right,
back in the foreground.
I didn't have a beard
at the time.
This is crazy, Francisco.
Mrs. Helena...
I promise to send news
every week.
I give you my word of honor!
I may even forgive you,
Miranda...
but I'll never trust you again.
I've learned, Mrs. Helena.
Please give me another chance!
Give your sons one more chance!
Did your husband tell you
my name for the duo?
-Daby and Diebersson!
-Really cool.
You like it, Mrs. Helena?
Everything will work out.
Miranda has changed.
And your father is right.
It's your chance
for a better life.
This hotel even serves breakfast.
It's a three-star!
Give me that, boy.
It's too heavy for you.
I've got a surprise for you.
Our new poster, isn't it great?
Daby and Diebersson.
Today I'm leaving home
Spreading my wings, I'm going to fly
I want a true love
A soul mate to conquer me
I want a passion in my heart
Today I'm they way folks like it
I want the mulatto girl's kiss
That killer love of hers
But if I can, I'll run off
With the blonde on my heels
Hello? Son!
Hi, mom.
I'm fine. So is Emival.
He sent you a kiss.
My reins are free
I'll fight for any passion
Today I'm going to party
Dance right through till dawn
Play, accordion, play
A slow dance
For today I'm the way
The dark girl likes
I'm the way
The blonde wants me
Play, accordion, play
A slow dance
For today I'm the way
The dark girl likes
I'm the way
The blonde wants me
Give me three.
Emival! Emival!
-What is it?
-Close your eyes!
It's an official soccer ball!
Where did you get it?
I won it.
Wait! Wait!
Goal!
I want the mulatto girl's kiss
That killer love of hers
But if I can, I'll run off
With the blonde on my heels
My reins are free
Fire burning in the hall
Today the dance is boiling
Sweat running, soaking the floor
My reins are free
I'll fight for any passion
Today I'm going to party
Dance right through till dawn
Play, accordion, play
A slow dance
For today I'm the way
The dark girl likes
I'm the way
The blonde wants me
There'll be the return match.
What happened?
Our car hit a truck.
But you'll be all right.
And Emival?
Where's my brother?
He's gone on to Goiania.
Hi, son.
Hi, dad. I'm fine, dad.
Where's my brother?
Your brother, son?
Look where your brother is now.
My son!
My son, Francisco!
My son! My son!
Help me, Francisco!
Help me!
Help me, Francisco!
Help me, help me!
I couldn't know
that was going to happen.
I couldn't.
We made mistakes...
but at least we were trying
to get it right.
I don't want it anymore.
Trade it for a TV set for Mama.
I want some bread.
Here.
Mirosmar,
it's already 8 o'clock, son.
-Good night.
-Good night!
-I'm going to rehearsal.
-Mirosmar, can I go with you?
Hey Welson, what are you doing
down there?
Hey Welsinho! Go into the kitchen
and eat something.
Good night, dad.
Good night, mom.
I'm not telling you again.
All right.
Welson! Go to bed, son.
Careful!
It's crazy!
Careful! Careful!
I've got to work now,
Wellington.
Bye.
Where do you think
you're going, son?
I'm going to hear my brother sing.
Mirosmar, the duo with Durval.
Who's Mirosmar?
This show is Dudu and Zeze.
And minors are only allowed in
with their parents.
You can't go begging
in there, kid!
I'm not begging, I'm working!
Get out of here! Beat it!
Scram! You're in the way.
I need you
Right here beside me
My love, I depend on you
My reckless heart
Is driving me crazy
I need you
Right here beside me
Without your love
I'm lost
I beg of you, my love
Come back to my arms
Welson! What are you doing here?
I came to see the show.
So now it's Zeze,
right, Mirosmar?
Durval's idea. Said it had
to be an easy name.
Zeze.
Hi, Zeze.
Do you know Zilu, Zeze?
She works with me.
Come on, I want some sweet corn.
Here, so get some sweet corn.
Hi.
-Let's dance.
-Come on, folks!
I'm going to send my brother home.
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing.
-Yes you are.
-I'm not looking at anything.
Stop bugging me!
-Go straight home, you hear?
-I'll come back another day.
-To your show.
-What?
You're too young
to be going to shows.
Shall we dance, darling?
Have a seat, Zeze.
Can I sit with you?
What was your name again?
Zilu.
Yours is Jose, right?
Mirosmar.
That is, now it's Zeze.
I understand.
Because of the duo, right?
Are you entering
the contest?
Yeah.
What about your boyfriend?
He left.
Want to dance?
Good afternoon. May I help you?
I want a piece of fabric.
We have this material here,
on sale.
I'm not sure
about the color.
I can help the young gentleman.
She will help you.
Anything special
in mind?
I didn't come
to buy anything.
You didn't?
I came to solve a problem.
I can't stop thinking about you.
After four months
of the festival...
it's time to meet
the winning duo!
We proudly present, Dudu and Zeze!
I want so badly to tell you
I no longer love you
That your love was just
Another mistake in my life
For how long must I pretend?
If my mouth yearns
For your kiss
I want to forget you
For just one moment
But I'll never get you
Off my mind
When I say
I shouldn 't love you
My heart says "I want you"
There 's no other way
When are you coming back,
Mirosmar?
Soon, I'll be back soon.
It'll be all right, son.
Everything'll be all right.
Sao Paulo is such a big city!
It's my chance, mom.
A record of my own!
These are Leandro and Leonardo.
Are you all right, Zeze?
The record will be in the stores
within a month.
Good.
Sir, like to buy a hammock?
-And you, young lady, a hammock?
-Not today, thanks.
Welson! Hey, Welson!
Welson!
-Can't you put something else on?
-What?
Change the record,
for God's sake!
But it's by my brother!
Really cool!
-It's my brother's?
-Look, Zeze! Far out!
I want to stay with you
forever, Cleide.
-Pregnant, Welson?
-Oh my God!
Look at me, I'm talking to you.
Look at me!
Now what are we to do?
Now what?
You two are children, Welson!
Totally irresponsible!
What kind of future can you give
this girl? Tell me!
I'm going to marry her, mom.
I'm going to be famous
just like my brother.
Give me the child, here.
I can't take it anymore!
I want to go back
to my mother's place!
BOOKS AND RECORDS
May I help you?
Have you got Zeze Di Camargo?
No. Who's that?
-A country singer.
-Oh yeah, wasn't selling at all.
The best country music we have
is Leandro and Leonardo.
Know them?
-Sell well, do they?
-Sold more than a million records!
Yeah.
You hear that song playing now?
"Solitude." It's by them and
it's beautiful. Really lovely!
It really is great.
By Zeze Di Camargo.
Aren't you taking the record?
No, thanks.
My songs are only hits
when others sing them.
I'm off to work.
I'll be home later.
Where are you going?
I need a job.
I can't stand seeing you
living like this anymore, Zilu.
Don't say that, Zeze
You have your work, your music.
Music! Music won't put food
on the table, Zilu!
We'll all be starving soon!
Honey, get your things
for school.
Go help your sister.
Mommy will be right along.
You have to be
a little more patient.
I've got two daughters to raise!
It was all my father's idea.
It'll never work. Never!
Cleide!
You knew it wasn't
going to work.
I still miss my son.
And I still love her, mom.
What time of night is this?
My house isn't a hotel, you know!
I...
I was singing.
Singing?
Yeah. In a club.
That's typical
of Francisco, son.
He even called Mirosmar
yesterday.
Just to tell him you're singing.
You took your time, kid!
-I missed you Zilu.
-Missed you so much!
Give me a hug.
I'm so glad you're here!
Put your things in here,
come on.
-Get your guitar out!
-Have you seen my guitar?
Let's see.
We're going to sell
a million records!
Want to bet?
What's wrong, Zeze?
I'm afraid that...
it won't work out again.
It'll work out.
I've always been sure of it.
A million, Zeze!
Here's your guitar,
let's rehearse.
I can't play anything.
I fooled father so I could
get out at night.
Don't let it get you down.
At least you can sing in tune.
-Are you serious?
-Of course I am.
Just think, before long it'll be
"Zeze Di Camargo and Welson".
Or Cristiano.
Zeze Di Camargo and Cristiano?
Horrible.
Lucian?
Getting worse, Zeze.
But I like Luciano.

CONTRACT WITH
COPACABANA RECORDS
What's wrong, Welson?
I can't.
-I can't do it.
-Of course you can.
Emival.
It should be Emival here,
not me.
But he's here with us.
I'm not Emival.
Look at me.
You're Welson. Luciano,
my brother and partner.
I need you.
Now, Emival...
with me and with you.
The kid's good.
Not so sure about the album.
It's kind of weak.
There's no hit song on it.
And there's plenty of
stiff competition around.
There's no hit song on it.
There's plenty of
stiff competition about.
Enough, Zilu. Enough!
Are you crazy, Zeze?
Can't you see I'm working?
It's enough to drive anyone crazy!
Look at this mess!
I'm sorry folks.
I'll take my stuff
the next time.
I'm trying to put food
on the table.
I can't deny it
I'm crazy about you
Dying to see you
I can't deny it
I can't deny it
Without you, all is loneliness
You bring happiness
I can 't deny it
I can 't deny it
You're my sweet honey
My piece of heaven
I can 't deny it
You're my sweet love
My joy
My fairy tale
My fantasy
The peace I need to survive
I love you
With my crystal soul
Reckless crazy carefree
Too complicated to understand
It is love
Stirring my mind
Something that
I love you.
Makes me think of you
Forgetting me
I'm sorry.
Makes me forget
Life is for living
It is love
Hits the bull's eye in my heart
Let's call it a night, Zeze.
We have another session tomorrow.
Rocks the foundations
Of my passion
And makes me understand life
Ok, Zeze, thanks.
Luciano, shall we do the chorus?
We're nearly hitting stores.
Not quite.
It's one thing to record an album,
another to release it.
-But you said...
-I'd record it and I'm doing it.
Which is plenty.
They're going release it,
aren't they?
Hits the bull's eye in my heart
-It's great.
-It's beautiful!
Really beautiful.
Where did you learn
to sing like that, son?
When is the song
going to be released, son?
The record company isn't sure.
The time's not right.
Maybe next year, dad.
How about supper?
What went wrong, Helena?
What happened to our dream?
I know nothing about it, Francisco.
It's not my dream.
I was wide awake
while I raised the kids.

-Just wait a minute, please.
-I'm not waiting a minute.
I've known Chicao for longer
than you've been working here.
-Just a moment.
-Chicao!
There, he saw me.
I've got this tape,
this is good stuff.
So put it on.

It's Ze Pereira.
Ze Pereira, that's right.
Joao Veloso from Campinas.
Thanks.
I want to hear a song
by Zeze Di Camargo and Luciano.
Is that Terra Radio?
This is Tiao de Morrinho.
Play it for me! Tiao!
Good morning, Sergio.
I want all this in phone tokens!
-But that's a lot of money.
-As if I didn't know!
Give me all that in phone tokens.
Count it.
I spent my whole salary
on these tokens...
to phone in and
request the song.
This is Alessandro
and I'd like the song...
by Zeze Di Camargo and Luciano,
"It is love."
"Terra Radio, your name
and the song."
-"It is love", "It is love".
-"It is love".
Hello, my name is Antonio.
Don't you think it's because of
my sons. The song really is good!
"It's love." Yes.
Go on, their names are
Zeze Di Camargo and Luciano.
It's three times,
if each of us calls...
at least twice, that's it.
Look here! I blew my whole salary
on these tokens...
because I believe
in my sons' song.
Not because they're my boys.
Because it's a really good song.
I'm telling you, it's good!
Really good.
Why would I bullshit you?
How long have you known me?
No, it really is good. You call
and say the song is really good.
Tell them the song by Zeze Di
Camargo and Luciano is great!
And now, the number one hit
on the charts...
"It is Love" by Zeze Di Camargo
and Luciano!
Oh, I left the tape
at the radio station.

Life is nothing without you
I can 't deny
You're my sweet honey
It's the first time
I'm visiting Sitio Novo.
To where everything started,
where you were born.
In fact you're going
to the house where I was born...
where mother grew up,
which belonged to my grandfather.
They used to call my father
crazy.
But we were the crazy ones.
This is the greatest memory
I have in life.
the best time in my life
which I never forget...
all the moments I lived
in this little corner of the world.
MR. FRANCISCO AND MRS. HELENA
MIROSMAR AND WELSON
SITIO NOVO HOUSE
It was crazy.
Crazy, crazy, really crazy.
No man could have the courage
to drag...
his starving children around.
I was the only crazy one.
I was known as a madman
in the family.
Everyone called me crazy.
I was crazy.
IN MEMORY OF
EMIVAL JOSE DE CAMARGO
She caressed my hair
Looked me in the eye
And began to speak
I know she never understood
My reasons for parting
But she knows when sons grow up
They become birds and want to fly
I'd really like to have stayed
But my fate decided otherwise
My mother watched in the doorway
Blessing me and crying as I left
That day my mother told me
Of the ways of the world
It was as if she knew
Each step along the way
Without leaving my father's side
In that small town
She told me
Son, may God be with you
For this whole world is yours
I know she never understood
My reasons for parting
But she knew when sons grow up
They become birds and want to fly
I'd really like to have stayed
But my fate decided otherwise
My mother watched in the doorway
Blessing me and crying as I left
My mother watched in the doorway
Blessing me and crying as I left
My mother watched in the doorway
Blessing me and crying as I left
