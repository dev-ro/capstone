Port of shadows
le havre - 12 miles
- going to le havre?
- Yeah. Get in.
Thanks.
- Tired?
- Yes.
On leave?
You don't talk much.
No, not much.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
We're here.
Le havre.
Oh, yeah.
Look at this fog.
I know all about it.
I was in tonkin.
Are you kidding?
There's no fog in tonkin.
No fog?
Sure there is. In here.
Are you nuts?
Pulling a stunt like that for a dog?
- It's still a dog.
- And it's still my hide!
Take quinine if you're delirious.
Tonkin or not, don't mess with my truck!
Your truck, your hide.
If you don't like it,
why don't we take it outside?
Fine with me!
We really gonna fight over a dog?
Don't think i'm backing down.
All i had to do was bust your face,
and you could say
bye-bye to your wrench.
I thought you might pull a gun.
A gun!
Shut up.
You don't know what you're saying.
Just give me a cigarette.
Using a gun looks easy.
Like shooting wooden ducks at a fair.
You shoot...
and then some guy screams.
He holds his stomach and makes
a face like a kid with a bellyache.
His hands turn red,
and then he drops.
You're left standing there.
You don't understand a thing.
Like everything around you
has disappeared.
Anyway, here i am. Thanks.
No hard feelings?
- 'Course not.
- Bye.
- Want the pack?
- What about you?
- I've got more.
In that case, sure. Thanks.
Bye.
Good luck.
The little joker
all this fun is killing me.
Think he'll finish soon?
- I don't know.
You never know anything.
Come dance, lucien?
I said wait at the bar.
We're talking.
Fine.
You chose this place to meet,
but i hate places like this.
This is the worst kind of music.
I only enjoy fine music.
We know about your music.
You don't know anything.
You're delinquents, petty crooks.
Right. Keep the jokes coming.
Isn't he funny?
If you say so.
The orphan thinks you're funny,
and he's not much of a joker.
You make us laugh,
and that's a fact.
Laugh all you want to.
You should be ashamed
of the lives you lead.
Your parents were fine people,
and here you are playing gangsters.
It's demoralizing.
You could've learned piano.
A beautiful thing, the piano.
Listen, zabel,
you've had your say now.
Enough is enough.
Where's maurice?
Maurice?
Ah, handsome maurice.
I have no idea.
He used to come visit me too.
But when i saw
he'd become a hoodlum like you,
i told him not to bother.
This music!
Listen, zabel, maurice is missing.
And since we had a falling out -
- women problems, no doubt.
- Whatever you say.
But people think i did it.
Deep down you're flattered.
But since it could prove inconvenient,
you'd like to know.
Exactly.
And i'm sure you know all about it.
Yes. All about it.
You're mistaken, my lambs.
I don't know a thing.
You should have more respect.
I'm old enough to be your father.
I'm an honest businessman,
a rare enough thing these days.
I'll leave you the bill,
since you invited me.
Would you be so kind
as to give me my hat and coat?
Beautiful. Plays us for chumps,
then ups and leaves.
Let him go.
We'll go by his place later.
- What for?
- To have a look around.
I told you to beat it!
You could at least be polite.
I asked the price of a room.
You're dressed like a bellhop,
so tell me the price of a room.
- I said this isn't a hotel!
- So you won't tell me the price?
It's not for tonight, anyway.
I'm broke.
But someday i might -
beat it or you'll be sorry!
- Sorry.
- No harm done, buddy.
That bellhop's a real brute!
Scram, buddy. I'm in a hurry.
It's not every night i meet a friend.
I'm no fan of soldiers,
but i feel sorry for 'em.
I could've been one if i hadn't
fallen on my head the day of the draft.
- Scram, will you?
- You a brute, too?
No, but i asked you
to leave me alone.
I see what's going on.
Sticking to me like glue!
- Your dog?
- No.
If you're looking for a hideout,
maybe i can help.
- The problem is i'm broke.
- I'll take you to panama's.
- Panama's?
- The safest place on the coast.
Better than any seaside resort.
Four planks, a door and a roof.
- My dream -
- dream on your feet and you'll fall down.
Who cares?
We're here.
Over there, where the light is.
My dream is to sleep just once
between real white sheets.
One on top
and another one under me.
Your mutt's back.
I said it wasn't mine.
Beat it, will you?
I've got no dog, no nothing.
- Don't like dogs?
- Don't like anyone looking for a master.
Haven't you found your own?
Not yet.
- Who's there?
- Half-pint.
Open up. I'm with a friend.
Come in.
Good evening.
- Want a drink?
- I'm not thirsty. I'm tired.
Even if i was, i'm broke.
Doesn't matter.
My house is your house.
I'm warning you, don't go on
about the fog or your problems.
There's no fog here.
It's always fair weather.
The hands are nailed down.
So...
keep your secrets to yourself.
Don't worry.
I'm not a big talker.
I am, but i'm discreet.
What do you think of this?
Genuine.
I bought it down in panama.
In 1906.
Splits the americas in two.
You cross in a boat.
You're down below
and the monkeys are up above.
Blue monkeys.
It's marvelous.
Tired?
- A bit.
Forgive me.
It's none of my business
if you're tired or not.
I don't usually ask questions.
No big deal, pal.
Put that down, idiot!
You know the crew comes loose.
You already swallowed a cabin boy.
Panama, 1906.
Thirty-two years in a bottle.
And you were going
to guzzle it down, fleabag.
When i'm thirsty -
ah, who cares!
What i'd really like -
i know.
To sleep in white sheets.
- Hi, panama.
- Hi, michel.
We've got company tonight.
Yeah, fashionable society.
Oh, society is what it is,
a bit sinister, a bit seamy.
But i've heard
there are beautiful things in it too.
- Why not paint them?
- Paint them?
I tried.
I painted flowers, women, children.
It's like i painted
the crime right into it.
I'd see a crime in a rose.
It's called painting
with a palette knife.
What could be simpler than a tree?
But when i paint one,
it sets everyone on edge.
It's because there's someone
or something hidden behind that tree.
I can't help painting
what's hidden behind things.
To me, a swimmer
is already a drowned man.
- A still life, eh?
- Shut up, idiot.
I'm the idiot.
You have to be an idiot to go on living
with such discontent, such anxiety.
Don't you think?
- I think you're damn complicated.
It'll all work out.
I'm done.
I've come full circle.
Still thinking of suicide?
Some people go fishing
or hunting or to war.
Others commit crimes of passion.
Some commit suicide.
You have to kill someone.
- That's life.
- Yes.
For example, you drink.
You drink to kill something inside
that bothers you.
Me?
I drink to get drunk!
Same thing.
And you, i'm sure if i painted you -
leave me out of this.
You'd have your hands
in your pockets on a foggy night -
that's enough, damn it!
You yak and yak
and spout your big ideas.
Big ideas bug me!
- You been drinking, too?
- Shut up. What would you know?
I'm hot under the collar
so you think i'm drunk.
Well, i'm not.
I haven't eaten in two days.
It'd make a great tattoo
on my belly: "empty pantry."
- Don't they feed you in the army?
- What do you care?
If you're hungry, just say so.
I know. I'm supposed to say i'm hungry
and it'll all work out.
But pride makes me hold it in.
I've got my pride.
Funny, huh?
Bull-headed, they say.
Exactly! I'm bull-headed!
You're pretty bull-headed yourself.
You said you were hungry.
- Yeah, i'm hungry.
- Come with me.
I've got bread,
sausage and cheshire cheese.
I always bought
cheshire cheese in panama.
If you haven't eaten in a while,
take it slow.
Aren't you gonna say
"bon appetit"?
Where are your manners?
Hey, mutt! Long time no see.
You're hungry too, eh?
- Is he yours?
- Yes.
He's got a pretty face.
So do you.
You're beautiful and i like you.
No kidding.
You're skinny, but i like you.
Like in the movies.
One look and i liked what i saw.
Love at first sight.
L-o-v-e.
You know, the little guy
with wings and arrows.
Hearts carved into trees.
Romance, and then tears.
It's always the same story,
the same old rotten business.
You really mean that?
- What?
- What you said about love.
Dames are always like that.
Out hustling, but sappy
as a dime-store romance.
What did you say? Hustling?
Yeah.
You take english in school?
Hustling. Turning tricks.
Why are you talking to me like this?
Listen to this!
Don't tell me you're here
to bring grandma some cake.
You're not little red riding hood.
And that's too bad,
'cause i'm the big bad wolf.
The big bad wolf's a swell guy.
Think khaki's my color?
Why are you always laughing?
It's not a real laugh.
It's sad.
Ever see a dame love a soldier?
They love soldiers on parade,
stepping high, kicking up dust.
But come along in your daily gear
and watch how they treat you.
Why am i telling you this?
It's no use.
Men and women can never get along.
They don't talk the same.
Different vocabulary.
Maybe they can't get along,
but they can love each other.
Have you ever loved anyone?
- Not really.
- There you have it.
What was that?
I don't know.
- What is it?
- Bad guys.
You find a nice quiet place
to get away from them,
and that's where they come
to kill each other.
Great lighting.
Like a tomb.
- Well?
- Well, what? It's so sad.
Can't you even follow
a guy in a taxi?
We didn't lose him.
He's in that shack.
- What shack?
- Over there.
That dump? Get on.
I'm sure he's here.
Easy as pie.
We'll just go in and get him.
Open up.
We're dying of thirst.
Drinks are all gone.
We're closed.
If you don't open the door, we will.
You won't like it.
- Break it down?
This is your warning shot,
panama-style.
Hang around and lead starts flying.
- Damn. They're going to shoot.
- Does the shooting scare you?
- I wish it was only that!
- What else?
- I can't tell you.
- Don't be afraid. I'm here.
- You're sweet.
What's your name?
Nelly.
Mine's jean.
Bastards!
A real battle at sea!
The captain's going down
with the ship.
I think they got the hint.
What a beautiful night.
A beautiful night indeed.
Looks like blood.
Blood?
Hey, you!
What are you doing?
Are you hurt?
I must have cut my hand
when i fell.
May i come in?
Go on in.
The world's a strange place
in the wee hours for those with eyes to see.
He mustn't see me here.
No problem.
I don't care to see anyone either.
They were after me like wolves.
I ran and just barely got away.
A rum, barkeep.
- No rum here.
But if you'd care to wash your hands -
- yes, i would.
Funny how blood stains clothes
but washes off hands so easily.
Ever noticed how doctors and surgeons
have such clean, white hands?
Even though their pretty hands
wallow in blood the whole blessed day.
But i'm no doctor.
I'm in novelty goods.
No one asked.
There's a bucket
of rainwater outside.
As you like.
You're an artist?
I'm sorry i didn't become an artist.
I adore the arts.
Especially music.
Religious music in particular.
It brings back memories.
I like to rummage
through old memories.
Family, childhood...
where's your cut?
I don't see anything.
I thought i was hurt.
I guess i was wrong.
In all the excitement,
i lost my package.
How upsetting.
So it wasn't your blood?
Listen, i know nothing about you,
and it's none of my business.
The sun's up. You can go.
I don't like your face.
Some people have likable faces,
some don't.
Doesn't matter.
After all, what's a face?
Not much.
No one likes my face,
but believe it or not,
when i look in the mirror, i like it.
After all, better this head
than no head at all.
With every sunrise we think
something new is going to happen,
something fresh.
Then the sun goes to bed,
and so do we.
It's sad.
Did you mean what you said before?
What?
About love.
Why else would i have said it?
I don't know.
A line to soften up the client.
Client?
Sorry if i'm interrupting something.
Nothing like a cold shower
to perk a man up.
Fresh as a rose and ready to work!
- No kidding. You work?
- Yes. On the docks.
This holds two quarts.
I steal two quarts in the morning
and sell it at night.
Illegal, of course,
but i'm the only thief
who recorks the barrel.
Professional courtesy.
Good-bye.
Pardon me, gorgeous,
but work is work.
Bye.
You staying here?
- Where are you headed?
- I don't know.
Just like me.
- Do you love life?
- What?
You love life?
It has its moments.
Does life love you?
She's been rotten to me so far,
but maybe she'll change,
since i love her.
Thanks for your hospitality.
You were great.
You kept me company.
I should thank you.
If i can do anything to help...
help me? I don't know.
You could get me
some civvies. Anything.
I see.
On indefinite leave, are you?
- You said you didn't ask questions.
- Don't you trust me?
Yeah, but -
i only have this one old suit,
and it suits me fine.
But come back tonight.
I'll see what i can dig up.
Thanks.
What size shoe do you take?
- An eight. Why?
- Just asking.
Coming?
- Nothing ever happens by chance.
- Chance?
He wears a size eight, like me.
He needs clothes.
I've got some.
He'd like a new life,
but he'll need a pass.
He needs an identity.
That much is clear.
What luck.
I've got one too many.
Mine.
He might be able to use it.
I'm going for a swim.
The sea's rough and it's foggy.
What's that?
Just telling it like it is:
The sea is rough and it's foggy.
And that's just fine.
I'm no great swimmer,
but i have a hunch
i'll end up very far out.
What do you expect me to say?
Nothing.
Good.
Michel!
Don't be stupid!
What's the use?
Damned fog.
Damned filthy fog.
Shoes...
broken bottles, an old comb.
The bottom of the ocean's
a swell place.
That's not the bottom.
It's farther out, and deeper.
What are you, a diver?
How old are you?
- Seventeen.
Me too.
I was 17 too.
- That's funny.
- What?
- Look at nelly.
- Where?
- Over there. With the soldier.
- Funny.
What the hell!
I thought we were going for java.
- Shut up. This'll be fun.
I'll be at panama's tonight.
Why not come by?
If i can.
You have any money?
Why? You want some?
Dummy! I know you don't have any,
since you were starving.
Then why did you ask?
Hey.
Come over here, okay?
- What do you want?
- Nothing. Just passing by.
I stopped to say hello...
and ask how maurice is doing.
You should know.
- I don't. Leave me alone.
Old maurice,
already forgotten and replaced.
Incredible. You skate around
with just anyone, but you snub me.
Why?
You know i think you're beautiful.
You have a beautiful mouth.
I like it.
- Don't touch me!
"Don't touch me."
Like maurice didn't touch you, right?
Or the others? How about him?
Everyone but me.
Leave me alone!
Instead of wiggling your fanny
at the little joker,
you'd better stay in the shop
with your guardian.
By the way, tell zabel
that last night's little bullfight
was just a warning.
- Don't drag me into this. It's all vile.
- Me too? Am i vile?
Especially you!
- Especially me?
- Leave me alone!
Why don't you leave the lady alone
like she asks?
I'll give you some advice:
Go on making circles in the water.
Soldiers are easily amused, right?
They spit in the water
and they're happy as clams.
Fine. Just leave her alone.
This guy thinks he's mr. Cool.
Has it all under control.
Listen, it's three against one.
Three? Can't you count?
Oh, you're counting on the big guy.
Because you two aren't much.
- Come on.
- Leave her alone.
What? Soldier boy is giving orders!
Get lost!
- Sorry. I can get violent.
- Can't you take a joke?
Leaving?
In a hurry all of a sudden?
Stay back. Don't hit me.
Don't hit me!
I'm warning you, watch your step.
Watch out!
Watch out for what?
Not so tough now, are you?
You're pale, shaking like jelly.
Not a pretty sight.
A word of advice: Cross the street
if you see me coming, and quick.
Otherwise you'll get this!
Come on.
You coming or not?
- Get a load of lucien. He's ready to cry.
- Some joke.
Why did you do that?
You don't even know if i'm worth it.
You said you were in a hurry.
I don't know anymore.
I ran away.
If i go back, it'll be awful.
Same thing if i don't.
I should go back too.
But like you say,
if i do, it'll be awful.
Good-bye, jean.
If i can,
i'll go to panama's tonight.
Good-bye.
It's me.
Listen to this. It's beautiful.
Shut up.
You mock anything
that's beautiful or decent.
Shut up! You've made fools of us
for the last time!
What's gotten into you?
Are you drunk or high?
I'm fed up with being humiliated.
I'm a man, you hear?
I'm a man and i'll prove it!
Put that away.
We came to talk.
Hotheaded youth.
Give the papers back.
All of them!
And tell us where maurice is.
I bet you bumped him off!
Bumped him off.
Nice language.
What were you doing with your packages
down by the shore these last few nights?
Answer me, or -
- or what?
Or i'll have to show you who i am.
I know who you are.
You're lucien legardier,
from a good family that raised you badly.
Too much pocket money
always leaves you wanting more.
So you pull some capers
and get in hot water,
then you come
crying to zabel to save you.
You're an ungrateful wretch.
I've saved your hide many a time.
Last night you tried to run me down.
You tried to shoot me.
I don't know where maurice is!
All i know is that
those papers are safe.
If it's god's will
i die a violent death,
i'm warning you,
you'll all be in big trouble.
You came here to scare me,
and it didn't work.
They came here to scare me.
Scare me!
Don't you worms know
i can't even scare myself?
Make him shut up!
Make him shut up or i'll kill him!
I swear i'll pop him!
- Are you nuts? What good would it do?
- Let me go!
Go out the back.
One day i'll show you i'm somebody.
- What's with him?
- A soldier gave him a lesson this morning.
Over nelly.
Lucien wanted to talk to her.
The soldier came and slapped him silly.
- What did lucien do?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
Those soldiers are good boys.
Why tell me that?
You're his friend.
Oh, friends!
Expecting someone for lunch?
- My goddaughter.
Think she'll come back?
She always has before.
That's her. Go away.
Good-bye.
You fly off like a swallow.
Leave your poor old guardian behind.
I've been worried sick.
Why'd you run away the other night?
- I was afraid.
What a child you are!
Why come back, then?
The others scare me too.
Where else can i go?
Aren't you happy here?
Haven't i always been good to you?
It's odd. Still a little girl,
but already a woman.
Don't look at me like that!
- Where were you last night?
- Nowhere. I took a walk.
You followed the troops.
Handsome soldiers, right?
Hey.
Is it leaving soon?
- Tomorrow.
- Where to?
- Venezuela, i think.
Cruises
can i help you?
No, just looking.
I'll go. You must be tired.
- May i help you?
- I'd like the little box in the window.
I'd like it engraved "jean and nelly"
with today's date. It's a souvenir.
"Jean and nelly." nice.
It's good to see a man with feelings.
People are so callous today.
This man would like
to give you a present.
Your present to nelly
will be my present to you.
A friend of my goddaughter
is a friend of mine.
Do you like animals?
Animals don't like me.
May i help you?
- I'd like some postcards.
Why did you come here?
Did you follow me?
No. I was walking
and saw the shop, so i came in.
Why buy me a souvenir?
I've got money to burn.
I don't like women's money.
Men's money, women's money.
What's the difference?
Sorry, but business is business.
Will you have coffee with us?
Thanks, but -
come now. Soldiers aren't known
to stand on ceremony.
Come in.
You're on leave, right?
You're not from here.
I bet you're from paris.
- Right.
It's obvious.
Have a seat.
Everyone's welcome here.
Are you visiting family?
Nelly, get some cognac
from the cellar.
Nice, isn't she?
She runs away from time to time,
but nothing serious.
I've heard her mother did the same.
She runs away, but nothing serious.
Her mother ran away one day
and never returned.
The child lived with her father.
A fine man, but then he died.
More coffee?
I'm sure it's better
than what you're used to.
- You enjoy military life?
- You get to travel.
- Have you been in le havre long?
- Since last night.
Pretty town, isn't it?
What's wrong?
Come on, nelly.
Don't touch me!
- Wait. I must speak to you.
- Let him go! What do you want with him?
You're feverish.
Come lie down for a while.
I'll take you to your room.
Come, my dear.
Such a sensitive child.
The slightest thing sets her off.
You were at panama's last night.
What's it to you?
I didn't see you, but i saw your dog.
He growled at me.
Nelly was there, wasn't she?
I don't answer
questions i don't like.
Only people with guilty consciences
spend the night at panama's.
Is that so?
I have you in mind
as much as myself when i say that.
Are you good
at remembering numbers? I am.
For example: 3614.
I saw it once and i remember it.
- What?
Drop the act. It's your serial number.
I saw it on your shirt.
So what?
Just that.
For people who do me favors,
i know how to keep a secret.
And for the rest?
For the rest, it depends.
You've already done me a favor
without knowing it.
By beating up lucien legardier.
- Who?
- This morning on the docks.
I know what goes on,
and what i don't know, i can guess.
You didn't come
to le havre by chance.
That's none of your business.
Perhaps, but i'm interested.
You came here for the ships.
You did something stupid
and you want to get away.
Change your identity.
You want to leave, and i can help.
- I didn't ask you.
If you need money, i've got it.
Identification, a passport, too.
Lucien legardier is
an immoral good-for-nothing.
He follows me. He threatens me.
He's capable of anything.
- So?
- So i help you and you help me.
Everyone's happy.
Lucien is on the dock at night.
So are you.
You push him. He falls in.
It's child's play.
Society is better off
with one less good-for-nothing.
It's worth thinking about.
Yeah? Well, i just did.
In tonkin i saw
this squishy, disgusting bug.
Made me sick just to look at it.
They're called centipedes.
That's what you're like.
Your voice is nasty. Sounds like
walking in muck with old sandals.
My voice may be peculiar, but you -
i am what i am!
Every awful thing i've done
was because i was angry.
Because every time something good
happens, scum like you mess it up!
You make me sick.
I don't squash roaches!
Come on.
I couldn't stay.
I was waiting for you.
Watch out for -
- your guardian?
With family like that,
i can see why you keep running away.
I want to see you tonight.
- Where?
- I don't know. Anywhere.
There's a carnival on the pier.
- A big one?
No, very small.
At the far end, there's a carousel
with white rabbits. I'll meet you there.
- What time?
- 9:00.
Snazzy shoes!
That's why he asked me my size.
And i yelled at the poor guy.
Too bad he's gone.
I'd have thanked him.
Know where he went?
People come and go.
Buddy, we're all just passing through.
It's my lucky day.
I'm not usually lucky...
but today's my lucky day.
Funny how light a hat feels
when you're not used to it.
Damn, it's light.
The pants are a little tight -
ah, there's some buckles.
I can fix it.
Nice cloth, too.
He must be loaded
to give things away like this.
Must be.
He left this for you too.
Dough?
850 francs.
- 850 francs?
- And his id. A passport.
- A passport? Why?
- He thought you might need it.
He thought! What does he care?
And how did he guess -
- guess what?
That i wanted to leave.
Doesn't he need those?
Id is the least of his worries.
- You sure?
- I swear it's okay, so if you need it...
"michel krauss.
Height: 5'7". Average nose.
Brown hair."
It's incredible how alike
men are on paper.
You'll have to change the picture.
- No problem.
- And fix the stamp and signature.
- Easy enough.
Here.
If nobody claims it
within a year, it's yours.
Thanks. I'm not so good
with words, you know.
You coming?
You forgot your paint box.
You're michel krauss.
A painter.
That's right.
Good-bye.
- When do you set sail?
- Tomorrow at 5:00.
- For venezuela?
- Yes.
Pretty, isn't it?
The ships, the sea, the men.
Everything's beautiful
for a painter.
I've been watching you,
i knew right away you were a painter.
In my youth,
i almost became one myself.
It was in my blood.
Then i became a doctor. Madness!
Standing before you is
"the doctor in spite of himself"!
Dr. Molène,
ship doctor on the louisiana.
- Michel krauss.
- You wouldn't say no to a drink, right?
- No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.
- I've got a lot to do, too.
I leave tomorrow, but that doesn't stop me
from having a drink. On the contrary!
- You're leaving?
- For venezuela.
If that appeals to you,
it's a fine ship. You'd love it.
Voyages are a source of renewal
for painters.
- You take passengers?
- Are you joking?
You really want to go?
Why not? Nothing's stopping me.
If it's not too expensive -
- everyone knows about starving artists!
Come, young man.
Big decisions call for little bottles.
Hey there.
You look happy.
Had a good day?
Two quarts of the good stuff.
- Where are you going?
- To bed.
- Bartender.
- What can i get you?
- A room.
- Right away.
- What about my rum?
- Coming.
Something to drink?
- No.
All right, just a little one.
- A little what?
- A little rum.
But in a big glass.
I ask purely as a formality.
Artists are such bohemians.
Of course. My papers are in order.
My passport -
perfect.
I'll arrange it with the captain.
I've done some watercolors.
I'd like your opinion. You like it?
Watercolor? Yes.
Are you a landscapist?
I'm not much for theories -
- you're not a cubist, are you?
- Cubist? Of course not.
Thank god.
Cubism's not my thing.
What kind of painter are you?
Well...
generally, i paint
what's hidden behind things.
How interesting.
For example, if i see a swimmer,
i immediately think he'll drown,
so i paint a drowned man.
Well...
your paintings
can't be very cheerful.
Still, it's not the subject that matters,
but how it's painted.
To your health.
Another, bartender.
Mustn't keep friends apart.
What about the room?
You want it or don't you?
Oh, yeah.
How much is the room?
- Eighteen francs.
- And what do i owe here?
- Eighteen francs.
I'll pay my bill.
What about the room?
Too late. Bye.
Don't be late.
The tide waits for no man.
You have much baggage?
Very little. One bag.
One bag?
You're leaving
for venezuela with one bag?
That's marvelous!
That's my idea of an artist.
No baggage.
Independence, freedom.
Freedom is a fine thing.
Yes, it is.
Of course, you're not leaving for good.
But all the same -
you're not attached to anyone?
No one.
Ready! Don't move!
One, two, three.
Thank you very much.
Pity the trip's already over.
Wouldn't it be nice
to sail away together?
Together?
That reminds me - wait here.
I have to get my picture taken.
- Again?
- I need it.
To send to a woman?
Really?
- I told you.
I need a small passport photo.
- You're pretty like that.
- Pretty, but not happy.
It'd be awful if you lost him.
I've gotten used to him.
And to you.
- You're a funny girl.
Just looking at you
and hearing your voice...
makes me want to cry.
Let's go. Their guns
are giving me a headache!
- Are you hungry?
- No, thanks. I feel good.
Really? You feel good with me?
You have no idea
how good i feel with you.
I'm free. I'm alive.
This is what happiness must be like.
If you talked nonsense like that
to someone else, i'd think it was dumb.
But when you say it to me,
i really like it.
You've got beautiful eyes.
Kiss me.
Kiss me again.
- I'll get the tickets.
- What about the line?
Wait in line?
Who do you think i am?
Coming through.
We're with the ladies.
Six tickets.
- You've got some nerve!
Don't act like a big man.
We're the bosses.
Don't make me laugh.
My mascara will run.
- People like that should be -
- people like what?
- I didn't say anything.
- You'd better not.
Scram, buddy.
- Watch out for the breeze!
- My hat!
What's wrong? Are you sick?
Watch the dog.
I warned you.
Come on.
I'll plug him.
I'll plug him, and zabel too.
Pump 'em full of holes.
You understand?
Of course.
It's not hard to understand.
Life's a rotten business.
It was so gloomy at zabel's.
I was suffocating.
I would've gone anywhere.
At the little joker,
everyone was dancing and laughing.
Maurice was nice to me.
He said he loved me.
So i said i loved him too.
But it wasn't true.
No one was really dancing
or really laughing.
No one was in love.
They were just going through the motions.
You're not going to cry, are you?
When you say my name like that,
it's like you're calling me
from far away, like when i was little.
You're not all that big now.
I grew up too fast.
I've seen too much.
I'm damaged goods.
Damaged goods!
You're nuts.
You're the most unspoilt girl
i've ever met.
When a girl's young and beautiful
and wants to live,
it's like a man who wants to be free -
everyone gangs up on them.
Like a pack of dogs.
Life is hard.
Yes, we're all alone, every one of us.
But sometimes you meet someone
you hardly know,
someone you might never see again,
and they help you.
You don't know why. It's funny.
It's because people love each other.
No, they don't.
They don't have time.
I love you, jean.
Hush.
You're talking like a child.
I'm sure i really love you.
Don't leave me.
What would i do without you?
I can't go back to zabel.
It's over.
I can't live like that, always afraid.
Will you stay a few more days?
Who said i was leaving?
When i saw you in civilian clothes,
i thought -
what's the difference?
If you leave,
maybe you'll take me with you.
Take you with me?
Don't you like me?
Never let me go.
You're beautiful, you know.
- Do you remember?
- What?
Last night.
You woke me up and whispered
that you loved me.
I said that?
Impossible.
You must have been dreaming.
- No, you were.
- Me?
You were dreaming out loud.
Dreams aren't my thing.
Everyone dreams.
What time is it?
- I don't know. 11:00.
It's pretty. The sun's out.
- Why are you smiling?
- I don't know.
I thought life was so sad.
Suddenly i see maybe
i was wrong, so i'm happy.
Really?
Listen, i have to talk to you,
but what i have to say
isn't very pretty.
What is it?
- Breakfast.
Come in.
I brought the paper.
There's been a sensational crime.
Everyone's talking about it.
And it's really one for the books.
Cheerful boy.
How many sugars?
- Two.
Man's horribly mutilated body
found at 'port of shadows'
body identified as maurice brevin
underworld connections
had long worried his family
it's awful!
What's wrong?
I was right to be afraid!
I knew it instinctively, like an animal.
I saw it coming.
It's awful!
Well, well.
Don't cry.
Those screams i heard that night -
i'm sure it was him.
I knew i hadn't dreamt it!
Come on, don't cry.
It's true i didn't love him
and that he hurt me,
but why kill him?
- Do you know who did it?
- I'm sure i do.
What is it?
Excuse me.
I've come for the tray.
We've only got two trays
and 12 rooms, so it's not easy.
You weren't very hungry.
Can i take it away?
Yeah, scram.
There's a huge crowd on the docks
where they found the body.
And the plot thickens.
They also dragged out
a bundle of army clothes
belonging to a soldier
in the colonial forces.
They think he did it.
Who knows?
It's not possible!
You can't be involved in this!
If it weren't this,
it'd be something else.
I wanted to talk to you,
and then that jerk came in
with the paper.
It's simple.
A ship's leaving for venezuela at 4:00,
and i'll be on it.
You're leaving me?
You must think i'm a real bastard.
Why?
I should've told you last night.
But you were so happy.
You were laughing.
And i really liked you,
so i didn't say anything.
You did the right thing.
Things would've turned out the same.
Kiss me.
I can explain if you want.
It's simple.
I'm a wanted man.
- I ask no questions.
You can trust me.
I'm not so bad.
You can't be bad.
I love you.
And even if you were,
i might love you still.
You were sure you could get away?
It was all worked out.
I thought my luck had finally turned.
They wouldn't look for me
on the louisiana.
My papers are in order.
Unless -
- unless?
Unless your guardian, zabel...
he threatened me.
He'd guessed everything.
If he talks, i'm done for.
- He hasn't talked and he won't.
- Why?
Because i know something
that'll keep him quiet.
You think i'd let you go back there?
I've got nothing to fear.
What can you do?
Nothing.
You must go.
I was happy with you,
and if i know you're free, i'll be happy,
even if you're far away.
- I'll never forget you, nelly.
- Truly?
Truly.
If i make it,
i'll write and you'll come join me.
Yes, i'll come.
You're leaving, i'm leaving -
this is stupid.
We were so happy together.
You have no idea
how crazy i am about you.
I was crazy about you last night.
And now?
Now?
Just the same as last night.
Greetings, everyone.
They say a soldier did it.
- What do you know?
- They say -
they, they, they!
Who are "they"?
I'd like a room.
- At this hour?
A good man sleeps when he will.
Besides, i'll pay in advance.
It's early still.
All the rooms are full.
Fine. I'll wait.
How about a drink?
I'm not thirsty, i'm tired.
Is that you, nelly?
It's me.
It's good you came back.
I was worried.
Have you seen the paper?
- Yes.
I hope you learned your lesson
and you'll never run away again.
Don't worry.
They won't question you.
They still don't know
who killed poor maurice.
Some say it was lucien legardier.
There's talk of a soldier, too.
Maybe it's that soldier
you know, poor child.
I don't want him questioned,
you hear?
You know very well who killed him,
and you know i can prove it!
You're imagining things.
Just because you heard a scream
and found a cuff link,
you imagine terrible things.
Be quiet.
I know, i tell you!
I'm sure the police came
and you told them about jean.
The police did come today.
They were very polite to me.
But i didn't tell them
about jean as you say,
because if they looked for him,
they'd have found you with him.
I'm sure you spent
the night with him...
in a hotel.
In bed!
You don't scare me anymore.
Nothing will ever
scare me again, you hear?
He must be allowed to leave.
You've changed.
Your eyes are shining
like they've never shone before.
You're no longer a child.
Is it because you love him?
Is that it?
What's all this fuss about love?
Does anyone love me?
Welcome to my home.
Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.
You're looking at my watercolors.
Youthful blunders.
Don't judge them harshly.
Give me your passport.
I'll take care of things.
Thanks. See you later.
You don't scare me anymore.
You disgust me!
Do you hear?
Let me leave!
You make me sick!
It's no use shouting.
No one can hear you.
I want you to listen to me.
I won't come near you.
I want you to know why i killed him.
I killed him
because i thought you liked him.
That's enough!
That good-for-nothing maurice.
I couldn't accept that you and he -
enough!
I killed him because i was jealous.
You don't know what it's like
to be jealous, you little fool.
It's horrible to love like romeo
when you look like bluebeard!
Shut up!
I disgust you, do i?
I disgust myself too sometimes,
but that doesn't stop me from living.
Or even being happy sometimes,
like when you're near.
Let me go!
Even when you scream, i want you.
You're the only thing i love.
Everything else can go to hell!
Let her go.
Take your filthy hands off her!
You'll never get out of here!
- Come on.
- Watch out!
You think you'll get away like that?
You must believe in miracles!
Or santa claus!
I'll get you like i did him!
You're the filthiest scum
i've ever seen!
I'll say she helped me kill him.
You filthy bastard!
You don't deserve to live!
Rotten bastard!
Rotten bastard.
Come on. Let's go.
Why did you come back?
I had already boarded,
but i got back off
because i wanted to see you.
I wanted to tell you that thanks to you,
i've been happy at least once in my life.
The ship hasn't left yet.
Maybe you can make it.
The ship.
Please, you must leave.
Come on.
Kiss me.
Quick.
Quick, we've no time.
It can't be!
You can't leave me all alone.
You can't die.
I love you so much.
