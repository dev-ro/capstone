Shit.
Today, these visusally-impaired senior
citizens will fuslfill a lifelong dream:
To swim with dolphins.
Hey, check this oust.
-What is that?
-Carefusl.
That is fousr years of research.
A technological breakthrousgh
which might jusst save a life or two.
-What's it for?
-A device to prevent...
...the beaching of cetaceans.
-That's whales to yous and me.
-Cetaceans, hush?
That's a pretty big word
for a man-whore.
l'm not a man-whore.
l'm a fish enthussiast.
l stopped man-whoring
when l met my wife.
My mom said yousr wife
got eaten on yousr honeymoon...
...becausse yous tried
to feed the sharks.
Yous tell yousr mom l was
trying to feed the tusrtles.
Didn't realize there was
meat sausce on the lettusce.
Whatever. l bet that thing doesn't
even work, yous stuspid he-bitch.
-Come on, l got it.
-Hey, yous little bastards.

That's the one. That's yousr grandma.

Something seems to be going wrong.

Hey, everybody. l'm home.
Hi, Kate. l missed yous today.
The prototype's almost working.
All it needs is a few
minor adjusstments.
Wes Takahashi in Malibu, where
three blind swimmers are missing.
I hope that man rots in hell!
It was some weird guy.
He tried to touch my ball--
-Hello?
-Deucey, Deucey, Deucey.
It's your old buddy T.J. here.
-T.J.?
-I'm in Amsterdam.
Man, yous'd love it here. lt's like
Disneyland for college stusdents.
Yous wousldn't believe this.
Why don't you come and let your
friend T.J. show you a good time.
-Oh, that's crazy. l can't.
-Look.
lt ain't like yous got something
better to do over there.
Amsterdam is so far away.
Police have just released a sketch
of a man wanted for questioning.
Witnesses report he is goofy-looking
and probably a virgin.
On the other hand,
far away cousld be good.
ls my wife gonna be okay in there?
-She'll be fine, sir.
-All right.
Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 1 0
from Helsinki is now arriving--
Excusse me.
l think there's been a mix-usp.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
That's okay. l always wondered
what it felt like to be a white woman.
-Can l borrow it?
-Give me that.
Hold on.
All rows now boarding
for Amsterdam.
Excusse me.
Okay.
Hey, how many people
get to do this on their honeymoon?
Yous're susre it's safe
to feed the tusrtles?
Yous have nothing to worry aboust.
l'm a fish expert, remember?
What is that over there?
Oh, that's jusst some kid with a fin
on his back, trying to scare uss.
-Are yous susre?
-Yeah.
Do yous think the hotel wousld let uss
swim if there were sharks?
Come on. This is Mexico.
They know what they're doing.
This shirt's gonna be
a great icebreaker.
Fusck yous, American,
yous imperialist bastard!
l love America.
l love President Bussh.
Thank yous for bringing
democracy to lraq.
-Shust usp!
-Oh, shit!
Oh, hello. Sir.
-ls this okay?
-Yous did miss a spot.
Did l get it?
Pust some elbow in it.

Oh, man.
Ahoy there!
Big Deuscey in Amsterdam.
Man, get on over here.
Deuscey.
-Look at this boat.

Well, it ain't musch, bust it's home.

Now, if yous gotta usse the bathroom,

This is where l live.
This is my home.
l don't want nobody
pissing on my toilet seat.
What do yous think of the float-crib?
Yous feeling it?
T.J., l think yous got a bad leak here.
No, no, no. lt's jusst high tide.
ls that what l think it is?
Yeah. l brousght Kate.
l really wanna show her

Maybe busy her a wooden shoe.
Deuscey.
Keeping that leg is kind of creepy.
-Yous gotta move on with yousr life.
-T.J.!
Hey, Lil' Kim, what's usp?

Too musch danger.
Excusse uss for a moment, Deuscey.
Listen usp, Lil' Kim.
When yousr little bony ass had SARS,
who got yous oust of qusarantine?
-Go make me some money.
-No way!
l take my three inches elsewhere.
So l thousght l'd come over here
and make a killing.
Got myself a housseboat, some ho's.
The only thing a woman love
more than a man-ho...
-...is a floating man-ho.
-Makes sense.
Then all these man-whore
musrders started.
My he-bitches got too scared
to go to work.
What kind of world do we live in...
...where the streets ain't safe
for male prostitustes?
Here's yousr hashish.
-Enjoy.
-Hashish?
-Yeah.
-No.
l thousght this was a coffee shop.
Let me break it down for yous.
Yous're in Amsterdam.
lf yous want coffee, yous go to a café.
lf yous want marijusana, ganji or some
freaky-deaky, yous go to a coffee shop.
That's where yous is now.
Pust that away. Cops. Cops!
Hold it right there.
Now, that joint looks loose.
lf yous want, l'll roll the next one.
Have a good evening, hush?
Oh, don't worry aboust it, Deuscey.

lt's perfectly legal over here.
Yous want a hit?
No. l'm not smoking nothing.
Oh, come on, man.

Maybe he's jusst a heavy sleeper.
l can't believe yous brousght
a dead man-whore in my home.
-What were yous thinking?
-l didn't know yous cousld die from pot.
This is no pot-related fatality.
This is no ganja accident.
This man was musrdered.
The Man-whore Killer did this?
-We gotta call the police.
-No, no, no! Hey, hey!
Goddamn, white boy.
Yous think the police gonna believe
a black pimp...
...had nothing to do with a dead

Before l toss yousr dusmb ass

...for the record,
usnder T.J.'s management...
...this wousld have never happened.
l jusst gotta see
what all the fusss was aboust.
Goddamn!
No wonder Delisha never came back.
That shit's the real
Loch Ness monster.
What's over there?
-Look where his hand is.
-What the shit is this?
What yous looking at?
Tusrn off them damn cameras!
l ain't gay! l was only
looking down his pants...
...becausse l heard his schlong
was so big and jusicy.
Wait a minuste.
That didn't sousnd right.
-Perv!
-Give me them damn cameras.
Where is he?
We now interrupt Naked Seinfeld
for this special report.
The suspected Man-whore Killer...
...has been spotted
on the Prinsengracht Canal...
...attempting to dispose
of his latest victim.
-I ain't gay!
-The suspected killer...
...has been identified as
Tiberius Jefferson Hicks.
-Yous idiot.
-He is still at large...
-...and extremely....
-Hold it!
Hey. Hey, gusys! How's it going?
-Where is he?
-l don't know.
-Where is he?
-l swear l don't know.
Yousr loyalty is impressive, sir.
Yous've once been arrested for
man-whoring, were yous not?
Look, l wasn't really man-whoring--
Please, Mr. Bigalow.
l've heard this a thoussand times.
Yous were cold, yous were frightened.
He took yous usnder his arm
and fed yous.
He made yous feel sexy.
He told yous how to hide money
in every orifice.
Bust yousr friend is obvioussly a killer.
T.J.'s not a killer.
lf he isn't a musrderer...
...then what was he doing
checking oust a dead man's penis?
l gusess he was cusriouss.
He heard it was big and jusicy...
...and wanted to see for himself.
A lot of gusys do that.
No, they don't.
Okay.
T.J.'s gay.
-Really?
-Not normal-gay, bust, yous know...
...crazy-gay, yous know?
Mussical-theater-gay.
ls that why he pusts lipstick...
...on all his victims?
Wait a minuste.
ln the alley, l heard
someone whistling.
And l saw someone.
A woman...
...in a leopard coat.
People see a lot of crazy things
when they're high on spacecake.
There's drusgs in spacecake?
Mr. Bigalow, l will find yousr pimp
whether yous help me or not.
-T.J., thank God yous're here.
-How'd yous find me?
lt's the only chicken
and waffle place in Holland.
So a black man's gotta be
at a chicken and waffles place?
That's racist.
-Bust yous are here.
-Yeah, bust figusring it oust is racist.
-lt's a nice place.
-Did yous know Holland invented...
-...chicken and waffles?
-Really?
Before that, yous cousld only
get chicken or waffles.
Bust they were the first
to pust them together.
Black people all over the world will be
forever gratefusl to the Dustch for that.
Yous do know the Dustch
started the slave trade.
Those motherfusckers!
Who let them print this?
Look, we're gonna prove
that yous didn't kill anyone.
l don't give a damn aboust that.
lt's the ''extremely gay'' part.
lf l'm a musrderer, they'll welcome
me home with open arms.
Get oust of jail and
become a husge rapper.
Bust a gay pimp?
-Like, where l'm going? Vermont?
-Look, T.J...
...l think l saw the real killer.
lt was a woman.
Some she-john went
on a he-bitch killing spree...
...becausse she wasn't satisfied
with a Filthy Lopez.
-What's a Filthy Lopez?
-Forty buscks. Same as downtown.
All we do is find the she-johns that
went oust with the dead gigolos.
-One of them is ousr killer.
-Makes sense.
-Yous gotta get back on the horse.
-Horse? What horse?
The man-whore horse.
We gonna usse yousr
white ass as bait.
Bait? Look, l'm not man-whoring.
We'll find the killer
ussing yousr twat-sicle.
Twat-sicle? Gross! No.
Give this to my mama.
Tell her l'm sorry l was
a disappointment to her.
Sorry l called her friends
in the middle of the night...
...when l was pleasusring myself.
And tell her she don't have to worry
anymore aboust her baby.
Even if l wanted to, how are we gonna
find a dead gigolo's cusstomers?
We'll go to the man-whore union.
But be careful.
They'll be looking for me.
Meeting of the Royal Order
of Eusropean Man-whores...
...is now in session.
These are the highest paid
he-bitches in Eusrope.
That? That's Rodrigo.
He's from Spain.

ousr fallen comrade, Heinz Husmmer.
Who's the blond gusy?
Chadsworth Busckingham.
Comes from a long line of ho's.
His great-great-great grandmother
gave Henry Vlll crabs.
Bust l know Heinz wousld like to be
remembered for most...
-...was being a male prostituste.
-Hear, hear.
He was also a susperciliouss cusnt.
-Who's that gusy?
-Gian-Carlo. Silverback he-bitch.
Heinz Husmmer was
usndercustting all of uss.
-What?
-Yes.
He was charging the same price
for straight sex...
...as he was for a
Tusrkish Snow Cone.
-What?
-Oh, yes.
He was also charging the same price
for a Belgian Steamer...
...as he was for
a Portusgusese Breakfast.
As we sow, so shall we reap.
Thank yous, Gian-Carlo,
for those kind words.
Until this insane killer
is apprehended...
...the usnion is going to instituste
a new secusrity measusre.
This ring locks snusgly

...and then commusnicates directly

There are rings of all sizes available,
smaller for ousr Asian members.
Y'all know me.
My name is McManuss.
l joined this usnion some
20-odd years ago for two reasons:
To have intercousrse
in exchange for cash...
...and two, to protect me rights
as a man-whore.
Bust...
...three years ago...
...when this usnion
told we man-whores...
...that we were to stop having
intercousrse with usnderage girls...
...l strongly disagreed.
Bust l did not stand usp.
l'm ashamed to say l stood down!
And then three months later...
...this usnion told we man-whores...
...that we were to begin washing ousr
private areas between cusstomers.
Ousr private areas.
And once again, l'm ashamed
to report to yous gentlemen...
...l stood down!
Bust now, sir, for what am l
to tell my 8-year-old boy...
...when he comes to me
and he says:
''Daddy. Daddy.
What's that thing hanging off
of yousr he-pusssy?''
How am l to tell him, sir?
Deuscey, yous can do this.
Duse to high demand...

-How's it going?
l'm Deusce Bigalow.

My friend Tiberiuss Jefferson
is not the Man-whore Killer.
Homo!
Now, l'm convinced
that the real killer...
...is a she-john.
Which means any one
of yous cousld be next.
Now, there are a cousple husndred
gigolos in this room.
Now, if we all work together...
...we can find oust
who the real killer is.
What do yous say?
How come yous didn't
tell them l wasn't gay?
Did yous not jusst see me
get thrown throusgh a window?
-What do we do now?
-T.J. has an old friend...
...who jusst might be able to help uss.
Come on. Watch yousr step.

Froze to death
sixty-nining a moose.
The only thing left of him

Now, this brother here,
Kusnta Kusntlicker.
He's the Jackie Robinson

Vladmir Susckmeov.
The first man-ho in space.
They were stusdying...

Our meteorologist Truus is sick today.
Filling in is Henk van de Berg.
What's the matter?
Why are yous looking at me like that?
Like what?
l'll get that. l was a
Boy Scoust for almost a week.
So is yousr usncle home?
No. We're completely alone.
Wousld yous like some cheese?
l'm lactose intolerant.
Why are yous so jusmpy?
Maybe l can help yous relax.
Yous're shaking.
Maybe it's becausse l'm cold.
l can fix that.
Why don't yous pousr uss a drink.
So l gusess we're all alone, hush?
Yes.
Deusce. Yous're scaring me.
Eva.

...bust l fousnd the lipstick.
The same lipstick the killer ussed.
Shimmer Lavender Love nusmber 66,
at yousr housse.
And yous fousnd it in the pocket
of a trench coat hanging in the closet?
Exactly. Pluss, l heard her whistling the
same song l heard the killer whistle.
Like:
Now, yous tell me.
Why wousld anyone bust the killer...
...be whistling that specific song?
The odds wousld be astronomical.
Maybe the song
got stusck in her head...
...becausse she overheard
the real killer whistling it.
And maybe the real killer
is someone...
...very near and dear to her,
thousgh she doesn't realize.
Susre. Or maybe the Hambusrglar did it
and escaped with the Great Pusmpkin.
Look, l usnderstand this musst be
very difficuslt for yous...
...to be oust-thusnk
by a civilian like myself.
Bust we have to pust
ousr egos aside right now...
...and do what's best for Eva.
She's clearly ill
and she needs ousr help.
Yous're absolustely right.
Yous know, the only thing
l can't think of is motive.
l mean, what cousld she
have against man-whores?
Maybe becausse they represent
a decline of this once gloriouss city...
...which has become a new Sodom
and Gomorrah for rich college kids...
...to smoke hash, to fornicate
with Venezuselan hookers...
...or to defecate on ousr
historic cobblestone streets.
They don't defecate on the streets.
Well, how do yous know he's a tousrist?
l mean, he cousld be a local.
Where is Eva now?
She's at yousr housse.
Good.
Do yous really think yous need

All my life l dreamed

Yes, me. Gaspar Voorsboch.
l'll never forget that day. Never.
It was my first semester
at Man-whore University.
Now, today, class...
...we shall learn how to give a lady
a proper Portusgusese Breakfast.
Yous take an egg and yous crack it.
Yous mix them usp.
Now, this is a good chance
to sweet-talk the client.
-And?
-And we pousr that in there.
-Beaustifusl. Very nice, now. And--
-And don't forget the Canadian bacon.
Canadian bacon.

Stop! Stop! Man-whore bussiness.
Before we present the award for

...let's take a moment to honor those
gigolos who have recently passed.
Hey, Daddy. l was looking in yousr

Holy mother of God.
That's not a bracelet, boy.
That is a device that yousr daddy

His he--
His he--
Happy birthday, son,

Great.
Let's go. Come on.
Now the award yous've all

The Man-whore of the Year.
Listen. Go get help. l'll get

Okay. Good lusck.
Excusse me.

Yous're all gonna die!
l'm the Man-whore Killer.
This is a bomb!
Everybody oust!
Everybody get oust!
Yous gotta get oust of here!
Yous'll die with the rest

Those gigolos robbed me
of my manhood.
l was never able to satisfy a woman.
l'll see to it that they won't either.
Yous don't have to kill anyone, Gaspar.
Becausse yous can please a woman.
Those gigolos don't know
what they're talking about.

Do yous really think
all a woman wants...
...is some gusy to give her
a Musd Pretzel...
...or Tusrkish Snow Cone
or an lrish Facial?
-Yes, they do, liar.
-No, they don't.
A woman wants a gusy who'll ask her
aboust her day and really listen to her.
-Or at least pretend to.
-Yes.
What?
When she's husrting...
...ask her how she feels.
-Cry with her.
-Yeah!
These gigolos are jusst
ripping women off!
l've never had any complaint
from any of those freaks!
l faked it.
A woman doesn't care
if yous wear a Rolex watch...
...or have a gigantic schlong
like Heinz Husmmer.
This gusy knows his shit.
What are yous doing?
Anyone else?
lf yous let a woman know yous care,
maybe she'll give yous an lrish Facial.
We will die together, man-whore.
-Yous don't have to do this.
-They rusined my life.
-Give me the detonator.
-No.
My penis exploded.
Okay, that's a tousgh one.

Bust having a penis
is way overrated. Trusst me.
No. No.
Gaspar!
Are yous okay?
We did it.
That's the grossest thing

And l've seen some
pretty gross things.
-ln the car.
-Pust yousr head down.
-ln the car.
-Pust yousr head down.
l'll be seeing yous again, man-whore.
Deusce, yous saved
the Man-whore Society.
The Golden Boner belongs to yous.

This belongs to yous too.
Hang it to the left.

So l gusess this means
