Mom?
SAMI BLOOD
Mom?
Christina?
Listen.
Sanna and I bought it for you.
It's from where you come from.
I have no business there
with those people.
- Do you understand the lyrics?
- I don't like it.
It's so shrill.
And they steal and they lie.
And they ... whine.
So ... Let's go.
It's your sister.
Let's go in.
- We won't stay long.
- No, okay.
(In Southern Sami:)
Her father's death -
- and the loss of her sister
was a painful time in her life.
And yoiking was a way to survive -
- to find strength ...
... to find an escape -
- and to come home.
Home to the summer pastures -
- that Njenna loved so dearly.
- For Grandma.
- Grandma.
Grandma, please.
Elle-Marja.
My condolences.
But why didn't you come ...
I don't understand.
Every year she insisted on
marking your reindeer.
- No, I don't understand.
- She saved your herd for you.
- Yes, you do.
- I'm leaving now.
What a pretty dress.
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.
- It looks good on you.
- It's very pretty.
Look, Grandma.
Isn't it pretty?
She's never had one before, of course.
We're going home now.
We can stay the night with Jon-Olov
and your sister's family.
Most of them are going
to the calf marking.
- It would be so exciting for Sanna ...
- No, we're going home.
No, I'm too tired to drive that far now.
And they don't mind. We leave tomorrow.
No, I'll take my bag.
Where are you going?
- To the hotel.
- What?
- I can take care of myself.
- Come on, Mom.
Mom.
Grandma!
- Where are you from?
- From southern Sweden.
- Nice. Are you here on holiday?
- Yes. No, I'm retired now.
- I was a teacher.
- I see.
Here come the reindeer herders again.
Yesterday we were hiking
in the mountains -
- when a bunch of them came
and started making so much noise.
Very annoying, when you've paid
for a nice, quiet vacation.
- They really do like to make a noise.
- They do.
It provokes me -
- that they think they have the right
to ride their motorbikes everywhere.
- This is a nature reserve.
- Exactly.
I thought the Sami were
closer to nature.
Mom?
Christina?
I know you're in there.
We're invited to the calf marking.
The helicopter leaves soon.
Mom, please come.
I don't want to stand there
looking like a useless idiot.
Mom.
I love you.
Come here.
Drink, row, read.
Drink, row, read.
That's all I know.
Do you want me to talk to Grandma?
No, let's just forget about it.
Come on.
Elle-Marja.
Elle-Marja.
Hold him.
Now he's yours.
You two should be on your way by now.
Yes.
Speak Sami.
It will soon be Christmas.
And your sister will be there
with you.
This was your father's marking knife.
He'd have wanted you to have it.
You do see
that your mother can't manage.
- It won't be for long.
- And then you'll come back?
Yes.
Go to your sister.
You won't survive a single day
at boarding school behaving like that.
I don't want to go.
Close your eyes.
Close them.
Then you'll see Northern Great
Mountain in front of you.
How does it sound?
I don't remember.
If you can yoik it,
it'll feel like being home.
Yoik then.
Njenna is crying in the boat.
Njenna is crying in the boat.
Don't yoik at school.
Hurry.
One more time.
Look.
Little Lapp, Big Lapp.
Good day!
- Filthy Lapps.
- Do you sense the smell?
Ask anyone.
You get 100 if you shoot one.
Jåvva.
- I don't know the text.
- Quiet.
- I am a child both ...
- Loud and in proper Swedish.
I am a child both small and poor,
but glad I am as well.
Because my father ...
Hands.
- She can tell that I don't know it.
- Quiet.
I won't hear another word of Sami. Here
we speak a language we all understand.
Hands.
Elle-Marja.
I am a child both small and poor,
but glad I am as well.
Because my Father evermore
will love and care for all.
I feel His love, His faith I hold.
His hand will lead the way.
His love is worth much more than gold,
more than the world, I say.
Well done.
Elle-Marja will greet our visitors
from Uppsala.
I am a child both small and poor
but glad I am as well.
Because my Father evermore
will love and care for all.
Swim!
- Do you think the King is coming?
- No.
Why not?
- He doesn't live in Uppsala.
- The Queen then?
Right.
Stand in line.
Let's go.
You must speak Swedish.
Elle-Marja.
Would you like some coffee?
Do you like books?
You can have this.
I shouldn't really,
but I'd like you to have it.
Why not?
Are you interested in poetry?
Are you?
Wait ...
Read this.
It was my favorite poem
when I was your age.
This one.
I long for the land that isn't.
For all that is
I'm tired of wanting.
Lovely, isn't it?
To become a teacher ...
- What do you have to know?
- Well ...
You have to know everything.
You must know
a little bit about everything.
Go back to your own bed now.
Go back to your own bed now.
Do you want me to read about Uppsala?
West of the river lie the cathedral,
the university -
- the towering castle -
- see Uppsala Castle ...
... and the University Library.
Also known as Carolina Rediviva.
- I wish mine was nicer.
- But your dress is so pretty.
Welcome.
We have a gift for you.
It's a riegka
made of reindeer horn -
- in keeping
with an old Sami tradition.
What do you think?
It sounds Swedish.
Elle-Marja speaks Swedish.
Stop it.
Stop yoiking.
- Elle-Marja speaks Swedish.
- Stop yoiking!
Are you expecting visitors today
as well?
No, that figures.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- Emanuel Wennerberg.
- Christina Lajler. Nice to meet you.
- Christina Lajler.
- Hedda Nordström.
Christina Lajler.
Elle-Marja.
Welcome.
We have a gift for you.
It's a riegka,
in keeping with a old Sami tradition -
- made of reindeer horn.
Thank you, Elle-Marja.
The costumes are beautiful.
Such fair hair.
Not bristly at all.
Let's take a picture
of these two holding hands.
Of course.
Elle-Marja.
Step forward.
And smile.
Come in.
- Sit down.
- Elle-Marja, take off your dress.
18.0.
- What are you going to do?
- There ...
15.5.
Intact teeth.
What are you going to do?
3.2.
4.4.
- Are both parents of Lappish descent?
- Yes.
Good.
Go over there and undress.
Stand on the bench.
- Now.
- Elle-Marja.
Take off your clothes now.
- Does she understand?
- Elle-Marja, be a good example now.
Elle-Marja!
Good.
Put your hands behind your head.
Elle-Marja.
Put your hands behind your head.
There.
Good.
Photo.
- You're from Småland, Miss Lajler?
- Yes.
- I was born there.
- Turn around.
Such a nice region.
Njenna.
Look, the circus animal!
They're at a lower stage of evolution.
That's why they look like that.
Take back what you said!
- What?
- Take back what you just said!
- Did I say anything?
- No.
Take it back!
You know there's a sickness
that makes you hear things?
Take it back!
Hold her!
Let go!
Let go!
You're as much of a Lapp as I am!
Turn her head.
Now my hands smell as well.
Wait!
Hey, you!
This dance ...
- Come on, let's go.
- Would you like to come along?
Let's go.
Come along.
We'll help you with the washing.
- Go home.
- Where are you going?
Go home, Njenna.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Njenna, down.
Lie down!
I have a question
about this Standard Swedish.
You speak that in Uppsala, right?
They're two different things.
- This and that?
- I've told you a hundred times.
- I don't understand.
- There's a lot you don't understand.
I'm not surprised
that you don't understand ...
Hello.
Hello.
Yes?
Come.
I'm not very good at this.
Or, I don't really know this.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's your name?
Can I guess?
Something exotic?
No.
Christina.
Is your name exotic?
Yes ... Niklas Wikander.
Nice.
Thanks.
What's it like in Uppsala?
Better than here.
- I'm moving there soon.
- Mmm.
Would you like to go for a stroll?
What do you mean?
Do you want to take me
up on the mountain?
What?
Do you want to take me
up on the mountain?
- What do you do there?
- That's where you usually take girls.
And do what?
Take in the view.
How do you know?
That's what I've heard.
Do you want to go for a swim?
Don't you like swimming?
Elle-Marja.
Where do you live?
- What?
- Where do you live?
- On Kåbovägen. Why do you ask?
- I have to go now.
Elle-Marja.
- I had to tell ...
- I don't understand you, filthy Lapp!
Has Elle-Marja got anything to say?
Sister?
Answer me.
I know you can hear me.
Stop it.
I can't stay here.
Sister?
Njenna.
Can we talk?
Njenna, come here.
Don't you have a Swede
who takes care of you now?
Go to him then.
Come in.
I want to continue my studies.
- I see.
- In Uppsala.
Well, that requires papers.
Exams and a graduation certificate.
Can you write me a paper, Miss?
No, I'm afraid I can't.
Why not?
You can't continue your studies
when you come from this school.
Why not?
You don't have the same skills
as Swedish children.
- I do well in all subjects.
- Yes, but they learn other things.
Elle-Marja, you are a bright student.
But your family needs you.
Only your people have the skills
needed up here.
What if I don't want to be here?
I can't do anything about that.
Well, who decides these things then?
Studies have shown that
your people can't get by in the town.
Your brains are ...
You don't have what it takes.
You all have to stay here
or you will die out.
But you can write a letter,
can't you, Miss?
I'm afraid not.
Church of Fathers in Sweden's land
dearest among all on Earth.
Far she stretches 'tween coasts of sand
firmly rooted by the Almighty's hand
built for His temple ...
- Help!
- Quiet!
Quiet.
Give me your belt.
I'm leaving.
Quiet.
Be quiet.
Are you going to the Swede?
Nobody likes you.
Nobody wants you here.
You only think of yourself.
Nobody wants you here.
You're the Lapp kid without a clue.
Your brains are so small.
Nobody wants us.
You're just idiots
unable to think for yourselves.
- Yes?
- Good evening. I'm here to see Niklas.
He already went to Snärkes.
To ...?
- Didn't Niklas go to Sörmland-Närkes?
- Yes, I think so.
But Niklas invited me over.
I'm sure you'll find him at the dance.
Yes?
Pardon me,
but Niklas told me to come visit.
And he said I could stay here.
I see.
Elise.
Like Für Elise.
We were just having dinner, you see.
I didn't quite catch your name?
- Christina.
- Where did you meet Niklas?
At a dance.
At Udden.
I myself am from Småland -
- but my sister works in Norrland.
Gustav is from Småland, too.
That's right.
So where does your family live?
In Småland.
Here and there.
- Good cake.
- I'm glad to hear you like it.
We're thinking of serving it
at the party.
We've made the bed for you downstairs.
- Who's here?
- Some girl called Christina.
Who? Who?
Close the door.
You can't just invite people over ...
Hello.
I came on the train today
and I haven't found a place to live yet.
And then I remembered where you lived.
- I didn't mean to take your room.
- It's fine.
- Do you want one?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Can I stay here for a couple of days?
Yes ...
Can you ask?
Sure.
I'll ask.
Sorry.
What's this?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
I had an accident.
What kind of accident?
An accident.
What are you doing?
Coffee cheese.
- It's good.
- Huh?
No, I'll fish it up and put it there.
I'll try it another day.
I prefer milk.
Did you ask?
Niklas, come here, please.
I will.
We're worried that you haven't thought
this thing with Christina through.
Your responsibility.
I don't have any responsibility.
But what if she gets pregnant?
Maybe she already is.
- No.
- Are you sure? Because we ...
- What is she doing here then?
- Well, she ...
... needed somewhere to stay.
You don't know what she's after.
Thank her for visiting
and get it over with.
- So what ...
- It's not your responsibility.
I'm sure she's hard up,
but she'd be better off back home.
- They have resources.
- They? Who?
The Lapps.
I'm glad you came by ...
But ...
I'm sorry.
They're like that.
But we can still see each other, right?
Tell them I can work here.
What?
Tell them I can work here.
I can clean and so on.
No students in here
after the bell has rung.
Well?
This isn't the first time.
- No, it isn't.
- And I don't have time for this.
What's her name?
- Your name was?
- Christina Lajler.
Christina Lajler.
Girls, this is your new classmate.
Christina Lajler ... is my name.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Thank you and stretch.
You haven't done gymnastics before?
Have Elsa show you.
Come back.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Hey.
Come here.
Do you wear lipstick?
Do you want me to put some on you?
Look up.
And then ...
And this.
So you've lived in Germany?
Have you been to Berlin?
Say ...
What do you need this for?
What's it for?
Are you out to get someone?
What do you need it for?
Say something.
If you don't need it,
I may as well keep it.
Look at that dress.
Look, look.
Why does she insist on cotton print?
It's so ugly.
What are your plans for the weekend?
- Do you want to do something?
- Christina!
The headmaster wants to see you.
STUDY FEE
200 KRONOR FOR 2 SEMESTERS
Niklas.
You can sit here.
Niklas.
You have a new guest.
Sit down.
Olof, hand me ...
Would you like some?
Hello. Karin.
Christina.
Are you and Niklas old friends?
Not that old.
Where do you study?
At an ordinary school.
Aren't you the girl from Lapland?
The one Niklas met there.
- So you could yoik, yodel ...
- Yoik.
... for us?
That would be fantastic.
- I've never heard it.
- Me neither.
Ellen and I study anthropology
and we're doing our fieldwork up there.
It could be a birthday present
for Niklas. A birthday yoik.
Niklas.
Wouldn't you like a birthday yoik?
Sure.
Yes.
Turn off the music.
We're going to hear a birthday yoik.
- What is she going to do?
- Call the animals.
- No, it's a ritual.
- It really would be fantastic.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was nice.
A little long maybe ...
I need to borrow some money from you.
I'm not pregnant.
It's for school.
Why don't you ask your own parents?
They're dead.
Are they?
Are they?
My dad is dead.
My mom has reindeer.
But your name is Christina?
Elle-Marja.
Niklas, have you got a minute?
This is for you.
- Come on.
- Not in meltwater.
- But you smell horrible.
- I can't smell anything.
You can't smell it on yourself.
Come on in.
Hold on to me
and let me show you something.
Lie back.
Slowly.
Lie back.
Slowly.
It's like flying, isn't it?
Is it nice?
Grandpa.
What are you supposed to do
with so much cream?
And for what?
Mom?
Can we talk?
Go ahead and talk.
- But can we go somewhere?
- We can talk here.
Or do we need to build a finer house?
Read.
Read.
But this isn't your name.
My name's not Elle-Marja anymore.
I want to sell my reindeer
and those I inherited from Dad.
We don't have the money, Elle-Marja.
- But we have Dad's silver belt.
- No.
We could sell to someone else?
Don't you go and get all Swedish.
I won't just send you away.
Who's going to tend to your reindeer?
I don't want to be here.
I don't want to be with you.
I don't want to be
a fucking circus animal.
Get out.
Get out.
She's over there.
Forgive me.
