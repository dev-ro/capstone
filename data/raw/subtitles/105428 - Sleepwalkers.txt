Martha and Carl Brody,
mother and son.
No one's seen them
since Tuesday.
The car is a Trans Am,
blue with yellow pinstriping.
California license, ZCLG592.
No one's seen that
since Tuesday either.
I hope nothing horrible
happened to them.
They were so close.
Ma'am. Ma'am, please, step back.
Sheriff?
What do you think happened?
I don't know, but somebody
sure doesn't like cats.
Shit.
Looks like the place has been empty
for 100 years.
Well, it hasn't.
What the hell was that?
Jesus.
It's a little girl.
What's that in her hair?
A rose.
Tanya.
- Hi.
- Shh!
He can't hear us.
Shoot.
Come on.
It'll be back.
You always get them sooner or later.
Dance with me.
I don't wanna dance.
Sure you do.
You love this one.
Come on.
What's for dinner?
Roast chicken
and cranberry dressing.
Pumpkin pie for dessert.
Going anywhere tonight?
To the movies maybe.
With a friend?
With a special friend?
Ah, all by my lonesome.
Oh. Don't ask your mother.
Well, actually there's a girl
that works there.
I thought
I might ask her out.
Oh, you might?
She's pretty too.
Is she nice?
I don't know.
I guess I'll find out, won't I?
Jealous?
Concerned.
Right.
Concerned.
Mm-hm.
Concerned.
Should I be jealous?
Do you like that?
Oh, Mother.

Aah! Oh!
You scared me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, no. I'll take it.
Charles Brady.
Thanks for the help, Charles Brady.
Don't mention it.
Could I get a popcorn
and a medium Mr. Pibb, please?
Yes.
I'm very embarrassed.
Am I blushing?
You look good in red, Tanya.
How'd you know my name?
English, period four,
Creative Writing, Mr. Fallows,
the weird and terrible.
Oh, you're the new guy.
From Ohio?
Paradise Falls.
Popcorn.
Go ahead.
You mean, free?
Shh.
Heh. Thanks.
You're welcome.
I don't suppose you'd like
a ride home after work, would you?
Um, my dad picks me up.
Nice dad.
Yeah. Besides,
what would your girlfriend say
if you gave the popcorn girl
a ride home?
No girlfriend.
I'm new in town, remember?
Thanks. I'll see you in class.
Oh, uh, wait.
Um...
Welcome to Travis.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
I'm okay. How's my girl?
I'm good, Dad.
Good. Fasten your seat belt.
Tanya.
It's my son, officer.
A cat?
Yup. Had himself one hissy fit,
I'll tell you.
I'm sorry, officer. It's late,
but this allergy is so severe.
Yeah, I know. I got one too.
Mine's to the IRS.
Y'all have a good night.
Thank you, officer.
It just ignored the trap.
It was right by the window.
It's okay.
It's gone now.
I'll set some more traps
in the morning.
Did you bring me anything?
Anything special in mind?
Am I beautiful?
You're always beautiful, Mother.
So did you ask
this mystery girl out?
What kind of a girl would go out
with a guy she just met?
Not a very nice one,
I suppose.
Another one?
Goddamn cats.
Don't swear, Mother.
Just you make sure
you ask her out tomorrow.
What's her name?
Tanya Robertson.
Is she nice?
She's nice.
I'm sure of it.
She's pure.
Good.
I'm famished, Charles.
Famished.
They were sleepwalkers,
hiding in human robes,
feeding on virtue.
Loving to feed, feeding to breed.
So in the end, they ran.
In the end, Robbie and his mother
always had to run.
For one night,
the men would come,
in their old cars,
men with lights and guns.
And to the boy and his mother,
their curses and their screams
of rage always sound the same,
like the laughter of cruel gods.
The time of happiness,
too brief to be anything
but golden, had run out."
Very good, Charles. Very good.
Your teachers in Ohio
must've been sorry
to lose such a creative young man.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Fallows?
Isn't that where you transferred from?
Ohio?
Yes. Yes, it is.
Hey. Psst.
Ah, shit!
I suggest next time you keep
your hands to yourself, Mr. Crawford.
Yes, sir.
- Asshole.
- All right.
Any thoughts on Mr. Brady's
"Sleepwalkers"?
Miss Robertson?
I liked it.
You liked it?
It was different.
I thought it was very sad.
Sad? Why?
Because they were always
driven away.
Because they were such outsiders.
I think Miss Robertson
might be on to something.
Now, we all understand
that a story
has to have a beginning,
a middle and an end.
Right?
But that's like saying a box
has four sides.
Actually, Mr. Fallows,
a box has six sides.
Busted.
I'm just kidding.
You've actually
talked to him?
Yeah, he's nice.
Real nice.
I'm serious.
I can see that.
Well, what happened?
Did he ask you out or anything?
Nothing specific. Just a maybe.
We just talked at the theater.
- That's all you would've done anyway.
What a waste.
Well, excuse me,
but what would you have done?
Everything.
Everything.
Well, I may have plans
of my own
and they just might
include Homeland.
Ooh.
Yeah, right.
I can just see you
in the backseat at Homeland.
Tanya, you gotta admit, I mean,
your dad's gonna be there.
My dad's not gonna be there.
Your dad--
Hi.
Charles. Hi.
Charles. Um, do you know
Jeanette and Carrie?
This is Charles Brady.
Hi.
We are in the
same class, Tanya.
Oh.
Can I give you a ride home?
I mean all of you?
Um...
No, we've got a ride.
But why don't you go,
Tanya?
Okay, see you later.
I also wanted to thank you.
For what?
For what you said in class.
I mean, you really nailed it.
No, you did. So thank you.
I think I know how they feel, the--
What are they called?
Sleepwalkers.
Sleepwalkers.
At least sometimes
I feel that different.
Madam.
This yours?
You like it?
Yeah.
Whoa! You know,
some people use a door.
Really?
Yes.
Did you? I heard that somewhere.
Mm-hm.
Mom?
Mom?
She must be shopping
or something.
Let's go upstairs.
Okay.
Thanks for the ride home.
Any time.
Ah, wow,
these are interesting.
My mom does gravestone rubbings.
Pretty morbid, huh?
No, I like them.
You do?
Yeah.
Eww.
My room.
Oh, you got a lot of pictures.
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.
Oh, these are great.
Really nice. Makes you want to, uh...
What?
Oh. Just really get a good look
at these kind of places.
You know, the things
that we never really see.
My favorite picture's over there.
Which one?
Uh...
Whew. Um...
That one.
I like rocks.
You do?
I'd really like to see
how you see a photograph
before you take it. I mean,
you don't even know me, but...
Well, actually, I was gonna shoot
at Homeland tomorrow, if...
Well, if you wanna come.
What's Homeland?
Oh, it's an old graveyard.
Really?
Yeah. It's neat.
I love old graveyards.
Sweetheart-- Oh.
Mom.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't know you had company.
Oh, this is Charles Brady.
This is my mom.
Charles.
He gave me a ride home.
Oh, that's nice.
Charles.
Very nice to meet you.
Likewise.
Well, we should go.
We were just going.
So we'll do that tomorrow?
Yes.
Okay.
I'll walk you out.
Okay.
So you two are
going out tomorrow?
Yes.
Tanya's gonna show me, um...
Shh.
Homeland.
Oh, really?
You see, I do rubbings too.
Not quite as fine as yours,
but there must be
old slate gravestones out there.
Uh, yes. As a matter of fact,
in the old section near the woods.
Tell me,
do you use powder or stick?
I use stick.
Usually a number five.
Don't you find that a little hard?
Yeah, but I'm clumsy, you know,
and powder's so messy and everything.
Tell me, Charles, where do you live?
66 Wicker Street.
And your father? What does he do?
He's dead, Mrs. Robertson.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It was a long time ago.
Well, the Brands will be coming
to dinner tomorrow night,
so be back by 5, okay?
Okay.
She will be.
How'd you know
all that stuff?
I learned it a long time ago
from my mom.
See you tomorrow.
Okay.

Mr. Fallows. Hi.
Hello, Charles.
Checking out your
new environment?
Boring, isn't it?
Disneyland for cows,
but for human beings?
Well, I like it.
It's kind of peaceful.
Reminds you of Ohio,
I suppose?
Yeah, well, you know--
No. Actually, I don't, Charles.
I don't know and you don't either.
There is no Paradise Falls
in Ohio.
Your transcripts are also fakes.
Clever fakes, but fakes.
Anything to say?
You're mistaken.
Oh, no, I'm not.
But you are, Charles, if you think
you can wiggle out of this.
I don't know who you are, but I know
you're not who you say you are.
If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows,
you've picked the wrong guy.
This car's the only
expensive thing I got.
I'm kind of sentimental about it.
I don't think I can sell it.
Ow!
Sit still till I'm through with you.
Your generation is so mercenary,
Charles.
Money this, money that.
Well, money is not
the only medium of exchange.
You're right.
People should learn to keep their
hands to themselves. Here's yours.
I'm sorry!
Come on, boy,
get the bad guy for Daddy.
You know you want it.
Get this bad guy.
Come on. Here you go, here you go.
Here you go, Clovis.
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy, get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy. Get the bad guy.
Come on, Clovis.
Here we go.
Get that motherfucker.
All right. Good boy, Clovis.
Yeah, that's a good boy.
Oh, Clovis.
Well, Clovis,
looks like we found ourselves
a goddamned speedster.
Unit 3 calling home.
You in there, Laurie? Come on.
Andy, what you up to? Bye.
Got ourselves
one lawless perpetrator
heading east out here
on Gray Road. Copy?
Copy. Need any help? Bye.
No. I think I can handle this one
all by myself.
What the--? Jesus.
Oh, shit!
Jesus, no!
- Is everybody okay?
- Go get him.
You son of a bitch.
Report, Unit 3.
Need a location.
I'm out on Pond Road, Laurie,
still in pursuit.
Bastard almost ran down a little girl.
I think he tried to run her down.
And I think he's playing with me.
Get me some backup. Bye.
Pull over!
Pull over, motherfucker!
Pull over!
What the fuck?
What's going on out there, Andy?
Please respond.
Not now, Laurie.
Christ, Clovis, what's he got in there?
A supercharger?
I lost him.
How in the hell did I do that?
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me,
you fucking cat.
Shit, Clovis.
I know just how you feel.
Can I tell you something, Ira?
It's kind of weird, but, uh...
Horace, if you laugh,
I'm gonna break your jaw.
What is it?
I told you I couldn't see him
because of how fast we were going.
Yeah.
That wasn't entirely true.
How's that?
We were both doing 90.
I pulled beside him.
We might have been standing still.
So you did get a good look at him.
No, no, I didn't. Because...
You see...
He didn't have no face.
Andy, you got plenty
of sick time coming.
Horace, shut your piehole.
I mean, his face,
it was like a blur, like...
Shit, I don't know.
Maybe you got some grit
in your eye.
Makes them water.
Yeah, I guess
maybe that could've been it.
Andy, do me a favor.
When you do get this stampeder,
just leave that part out
when you're talking
to the county prosecutor, okay?
Anything else, Andy?
Anything at all?
Yeah.
There was something.
Clovis here got
a good look at him.
He didn't like him.
He didn't like him one little bit.
And it was the other guy too,
he didn't like Clovis.
It was like he was scared of him.
Scared of a cat.
Hm.
I'm gonna look for this guy
on my way home,
and I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him.
You didn't get it?
No.
Why didn't you get anything?
I just couldn't.
What about the girl?
It wasn't the right time.
Tomorrow. I can get it tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I'm starving, Charles.
I need it,
and you have to get it for me.
Oh, my poor baby.
What happened?
What always happens, Mom.
Someone saw you?
The deputy had a cat.
Maybe for a second or two.
He won't believe what he saw.
No, he probably won't.
Somebody will find the teacher
that I dumped in the woods.
It's already started again, Mom.
Don't worry.
Don't worry
But I have to feed you.
You'll see her tomorrow.
What if something
happens to me?
You'll starve.
We haven't even seen
another sleepwalker.
Oh, we aren't the last.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.
I can feel the others.
You'll feed tomorrow,
and then you'll feed me
and then we'll leave.
Nothing's gonna happen.
We just have to take care
of each other.
Okay.
Remember, I want you home by 5.
Make sure Charles
understands that, okay?
Yes, Mommy, and I'll be sure
to pack extra didies too.
Nobody loves a smart-ass,
Tanya.
She is smart, dear.
And I'm smart enough to know this is
her first date with a new boy in town.
We do understand each other,
don't we, Tans?
You know, Mom, I think we do.
Good, 5:00?
Five o'clock.
Bye, darling.
Bye, Dad.
Have a good time, honey.
I hope so.
Are we awful?
Terrible.
God, I've become
my mother.
Well, you met this kid.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's terrific.
He's utterly charming.
Does it have to be her?
You care more for her
than you do for me.
You know better
than that.
Why are you being
such a bitch?
Because I'm hungry.
You cannot be in love
with this girl, Charles.
Charles.
I'll get it.
You stay here.
I love you, Mom.
Do you?
Hi. I know you were supposed
to pick me up, but I was nearby.
Yeah, Tanya, uh...
Oh. Oh, this is a bad time.
Nonsense.
I'm so glad
you came by.
Thank you.
We ought to go.
The light for Tanya's pictures...
Will be just fine for hours yet.
Come in, Tanya.
I have something for you.
You do?
Mm-hm.
I won't keep you long.
I know young people
have to run and play.
Wow.
Charles said you were nice.
He was right. He usually is.
Oh, thank you.
Charles is very nice himself.
You have a very beautiful home,
Mrs. Brady.
Mm-hm.
Oh...
Wow, these are beautiful figurines.
They've been in the
family for a long time.
You probably wouldn't believe
how long.
Mom, we really ought to be going.
Soon, Charles.
Soon.
Just a second, dear.
This is beautiful.
Mm. Nice car.
Where's the Trans Am?
It's in the shop.
The Mustang belongs to--
His mother.
TANYA:
Wow.
Are those all your cats?
There's a lot.
Oh, they're strays,
but we'll get rid of them.
We're good at getting rid
of pests.
There.
It finishes you somehow.
Thank you. That's very sweet.
Oh, sweets to the sweet,
I always say.
Right, Charles?
Go on now, you two.
You'll lose the light.
Um, Mrs. Brady,
it was really nice to meet you.
Oh, very nice to meet you.
This way.
Thank you, ma'am.
Uh, this is it.
It's really beautiful here.
And so are you, Tanya.
Thank you, Charles.
I better get these
out of the way right off.
Your mother's gonna wanna know
some rubbing went on out here.
Me too, Charles.
Hey, wait up!
Charles?
Charles?
Oh!
Oh, hold it.
Come on.
Hey, Clovis. Hey, Clovis, what's up?
You catching a nap?
# There comes Johnny
With his pecker in his hand #
# He's a one-balled man
And he's off to the rodeo #
What are you looking at?
Hmm?
Ah. Ooh, very nice. Gotcha.
Oh, very nice. Smile pretty.
Oh, very nice.
Ah!
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, my God.
Sorry.
No sorries.
Charles, do you really feel alone
like the characters in your story?
Because I do.
I know.
It's wonderful to feel...
To feel like you're really
with someone. Together.
Look, I think we better--
Charles.
Shh.
You don't know me, Tanya.
But I want to.
Ow.
A little slower.
But I thought we understood
each other, Tanya.
I couldn't breathe.
Isn't this the excitement
you were talking about?
You're right.
We do understand each other, Tanya.
See, this is just how we live, Tanya.
No!
Tanya.
It doesn't have to hurt.
Don't you get it, Tanya?
I need you.
I need you to live.
Oh, God, please don't kill me.
Tanya, I don't think you're entering
into the spirit of this.
Why don't you just think of yourself
as lunch?
Tanya.
Charles?
Peek a baby!
I lied.
It does have to hurt.
Feed me, Tanya. Mother's hungry.
Just look at this shirt.
My mother's gonna kill me.
Get off me. Get off.
Stay away from me.
Now, Tanya,
when exactly did I lose your trust?
Help me!
Somebody help me!
# So allemande left
and allemande right #
# Come on, you fucking turkey
Get your right foot right #
# Get off the stage, you fucking jerk
You know #
# You piss me off #
Well, well...
Hold the phone.
Hold the phone.
All right.
Help me! Please somebody help!
Help! Oh, my God.
Get me out of here.
He's trying to kill me.
Calm down.
Tell me what happened.
He's right behind me.
We'll get him.
You don't understand.
He's trying to kill me.
This guy have a name?
Charles Brady.
He's not human. His face changed.
Get in the car. Lock it.
Lock it.
No, we both have to go, please.
Look, just calm down.
No, no, wait.
No, we both have to go.
Calm down, okay?
Please, no.
Everything's gonna be all--
Cop kebab!
No!
No!
No! No!
Isn't this fun?
No!
Get off!
Get off me!
Get off me!
I don't believe you fired
a warning shot, officer.
Aah! Oh, my God.
Now, where were we, Tanya?
Oh, my God.
Unit 3, Unit 3,
state your 20. Come on.
Hello? Hello? Hello? Help me, please.
Somebody help me.
Andy, get with the program. Bye.
Hello? Oh, God. Hello?
Somebody help me, please.
I'm at Homeland.
The policeman is dead. Please.
Please, please come.
Oh, God. Please. Please come.
Charles.
My face is so hot.
Come on.
I'm sorry, Mom. I tried.
I really, really tried.
It was the cat. It was the kitty.
You were right.
We've only got each other.
Shh, shh, shh.
It doesn't matter.
Save your strength.
How bad is it'?
Well, you'll be okay, honey.
But I'm afraid they'll be
coming for us soon.
We can go, Mom. I'll be okay.
No.
We've got to stay here
until you're stronger.
But I want you to help me.
Try to make yourself dim.
Will you do that for me, honey?
Go on.
TY
I can't, Mom.
I can't do it.
It's all right. I'll do it for both of us.
There's the car and the traps and...
Shh, shh, shh.
I'll take care of you.
Hey, buddy.
I ain't taking the rap on this.
I lock this place up every night.
It's not my fault if every pervert--
Don't talk to me.
Go talk to someone
in charge. I'm busy.
Buddy.
Yeah?
Listen.
It's not my fault if every horny kid
and weirdo, pervert comes in here.
I lock this place up.
I don't need this.
Okay, don't talk to me,
talk to the sheriff.
Yeah, I'll get right on it.
Get that...
That's impossible.
Sir, I checked it six or seven times.
Sheriff, hey
Not now.
Okay. His name is Charles Brady,
formerly of Paradise Falls,
now living at 66 Wicker Street.
And the rest of it, including the make
and color of the car.
Okay, we came in a red car.
And it was older.
But it wasn't--
It wasn't the Trans Am.
See, he took me home in a Trans Am.
It was a blue Trans Am.
And he left here in one.
Okay.
Listen to me.
I know I sound crazy.
You're not getting the point.
Charles isn't human.
Excuse me, miss.
Sheriff, I need to document
these bruises.
All right.
Do you have to do this now?
It'll just take a sec. Don't worry.
Could you just turn your head,
please?
Thanks. And the other way, please.
Oh, my God. My camera.
Did somebody find my camera?
I took his picture
in my camera.
Yes. Develop that film.
You'll have his picture.
Get on it ASAP.
Yeah, sure.
This is Officer Rayburn.
He's gonna run you home.
I'll have to come over later tonight
and ask you more questions, all right?
Okay.
Are you sure his name
was Charles Brady?
That's what he said.
Do you think he was telling the truth?
I don't know.
He was...
He was very charming.
Take her home.
Excuse me.
Um, sheriff?
Yeah?
Will you bring the cat
when you come this evening?
What for'?
The cat saved my life.
Okay.
Thank you.
Do her parents know assault
did not occur?
Do they know she managed to avoid
being raped by the bastard? Yes.
Okay.
Horace.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Yupper.
Here.
Drink some of this nice cold water.
It'll make you feel better.
I'm dying, Mom.
No.
My boy is not going to die.
Not ever!
They're coming.
I'm going to make us dim.
I can do it.
But you have to keep
perfectly quiet.
I love you.
Quiet, Charles.
It can still be all right.
I'm scared.
Charles Brady, if you're in there,
come out with your hands open and empty.
I'm so scared, Mom.
Shh.
I have to do us.
Keep still.
Dim.
Open up, Brady! I'm
in no mood to be polite!
Police! Hands up!
Ira, Soames,
there's nothing in the kitchen.
I told you to wait on my word.
I thought you gave it.
There's a lot of cats.
Well, I can see that, dickhead.
Come on.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.
- Help him up.
- What a Polish fire drill.
Get out of there!
Get back in the damn car.
Now. Move.
Move! Move!
What?
It's a cold draft.
Use one right now,
could you?
I'd like to set up a couple
of checkpoints in and out of town.
The perp's history by now, Ira.
He killed one of my men.
Look, all you got is one hysterical
little girl with a very vivid imagination.
What about the cats?
What about them, Ira?
That little girl needs
a good smack on the butt.
And if her mama and daddy
won't do it,
I'll happily volunteer.
Stay away from her, Soames.
Hm.
This is the best meal I had
since my wife passed on.
Boy, if Ira found out, he'd kill me.
Well, it was
already made, deputy.
There's one more ear of corn here.
Would you like it?
Well, uh... Well, yes, ma'am.
She's been up there
an awfully long time, honey.
Do you think we should--?
She's taking a nice hot bath.
She just needs to get clean.
Okay.
Honey, is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just getting out.
Your mother's keeping
supper warm for you.
Honey?
Um...
Thanks, Daddy. Um...
I just thought I would lie down
for a little while.
Could you call me when the sheriff
gets here with the cat?
Yeah, I will.
I love you, honey.
I love you too, Daddy.
What was that?
Who's there?
Identify yourself.
Police officers.
Maybe it was the wind.
It was not the fucking wind.
You're right,
that was not the fucking wind.
Who could that be?
Let me take a peek.
State police.
Probably Soames.
Hope he don't think he's gonna
question her before Ira gets here.
I'll get this.
Hi. I'm Mary Brady,
Charles' mother.
Charles couldn't come himself.
Donald, who is it?
I'll take care of it, Helen.
Just stay in the kitchen.
Look, Mrs. Brady...
I know he wanted you
to have these flowers.
Donald! Donald?
You have a lovely home,
Mrs. Robertson.
I've had lovely homes too.
We never stay long though.
Hey. You stay away from them.
If you'd just call your daughter for me.
What?
My son is badly hurt.
He may be dying.
Your daughter tried to kill
my Charles.
Good. I hope he dies.
I hope you both die.
I hope you both die and rot in hell!
He's my son. My only son.
Daddy?
Mom?
Mom?
Daddy?
Oh, my God. Daddy.
No!
Get off! Get off me!
What have you done?
- This is how they came out?
- That's it.
So was the camera moving or...?
No. See? The background
and the clothes are in focus.
Laurie, would you
get that damn thing?
Take a look at the collar.
Mm-hm.
Travis Sheriff's Department.
Where's Ira?
What's going on?
There's a woman here.
She said she's the Brady kid's mother.
She killed Don Robertson.
Slow down, Horace.
There's blood everywhere!
No vegetables, no dessert.
Those are the rules.
Horace!
What's going on? Hello, Horace?
Come on, Horace.
Answer the phone.
Are you there?
Horace ?
Answer the damn phone!
Horace!
Get that woman over
there to safety.
Hold it, right there.
Put her down.
Put the girl down.
Give me back my daughter!
Put her down!
Get Soames,
every man he has.
Castle Rock too.
Put her down!
Drop the gun, lady. Now!
Hello, dear.
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?
To see Charles, dear.
No!
No!
No!
Come on.
No! Let go of me!
Get in here, you bitch.
Oh, my God.
Charles. My beautiful Charles,
Mommy's home.
See what Mommy's brought you.
He's dead.
Look at him. He's dead.
No! He's not dead!
He's sleeping.
Can't you see he's sleeping?
You know what I bet
he'd love to do?
You'd like to dance,
wouldn't you, my darling?
That's his favorite song.
Did you know that?
I said, did you know that?
No.
Yes. He's a wonderful dancer.
But you don't have to take my word
for it. You can see for yourself.
What?
Dance with him.
Dance with...
With Charles.
Dance with my son.
Relax.
He's a wonderful dancer.
He'll lead.
- No!
- There.
That's it. Dance.
Clovis?
No. No. No.
No!
No! No!
Yes. Now, Charles. Now.
Good.
Good, Charles.
Feed.
Suck her dry.
No!
Stop! You're killing him!
Die!
- No!
- Tanya, get out of there!
No!
Help me!
Go!
No!
Holy shit.
Wait, wait, wait!
No! No! Come on! We've gotta go!
Come on! Damn it.
Wait. Charles was dead, wasn't he?
He was dead, wasn't he? Wasn't he?
He was dead! Yes! Let's go!
No!
No! No!
IRA:
Hey, Mom!
Sheriff!
No.
Oh, come on!
Oh, God, help me!
God, help me!
Okay.
You killed my son!
My only son!
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Clovis.
It's just you and me, Clovis.
Just you and me.
