YOU'RE HOME.
I, UH... I COULDN'T GET A CAB.
I HAD TO TAKE THE SUBWAY.
AND MY, UH, UMBRELLA
WASN'T IN MY BRIEFCASE.
IT'S BY THE FRONT DOOR.
HAVE YOU BEEN SMOKING AGAIN?
I WISH YOU WOULD
TALK TO SOMEONE.
I TOLD YOU. I'M FINE.
I'VE DECIDED TO LOOK AT THE
POSITIVE SIDE OF THE WHOLE EPISODE.
AT LEAST IT SHOOK
ME OUT OF MY ROUTINE.
YOU MAKE IT SOUND AS
THOUGH YOU DESERVED IT.
I'VE BEEN GOING OVER
THAT NIGHT IN MY MIND,
THINKING ABOUT THE
GUY WHO DID THIS TO ME.
IF IT HAD BEEN SOME
KID, SOME YOUNG PUNK,
MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN SO SURPRISED.
BUT HE WAS ALMOST MY AGE.
FOR ALL I KNOW, HE'S GOT
A WIFE WITH BILLS TO PAY.
HE EATS DINNER AT THE
SAME TIME EVERY NIGHT.
JUST LIKE ME.
COULD HAVE BEEN
ME, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT?
WHAT EVERYONE WANTS...
TO EXPERIENCE LIFE,
TO WAKE UP ENTHUSED,
TO BE HAPPY.
CAN I GET ANOTHER
ROUND, PATRICK?
STILL HAPPY HOUR?
FIFTEEN MORE MINUTES.
FIFTEEN MINUTES. "HAPPY HOUR."
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM
THE LOOK IN HERE, WOULD YOU?
WELL, AT LEAST I'M HAPPY.
I JUST SENT A GUILTY MAN TO PRISON
TODAY. GOT ANOTHER LOWLIFE OFF THE STREET.
SHOW ME A HAPPY MAN, I'LL SHOW
YOU A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
DON'T MIND ME ASKING,
WHAT MAKES YOU AN
AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT?
I KNEW A HAPPY MAN
ONCE. IT WAS A CURSE.
THAT MAN YOU KNEW, HE, UH...
HE WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE SITTING IN A BAR ON
A WEEKNIGHT, HAVING
SOME DRINKS BY HIMSELF?
JUST A GUY I USED TO
WORK WITH. HE THOUGHT
HE HAD IT MADE AND HE
LIKED TO BRAG ABOUT IT.
EVERY DAY HE'D COME INTO THE
OFFICE AND SIT HIMSELF DOWN...
AND READ THE
PAPER TILL 9:00, 9:30.
EVERY NIGHT HE'D PACK HIS
BRIEFCASE AT FIVE MINUTES TO 5:00.
AND EVERY WEDNESDAY AT LUNCH HE'D TAKE
HIMSELF A LITTLE WALK AROUND THE CORNER...
AND COME BACK WITH A
HAIRCUT AND A SANDWICH
AND SEVEN BUCKS' WORTH
OF LOTTERY TICKETS.
SO ONE MORNING HE GOES THROUGH HIS
ROUTINE, HE'S READING THE PAPER AS USUAL,
AND HE'S CHECKING HIS NUMBERS,
AND HE REALIZES HE'S GOT A TICKET IN
HIS WALLET AND IT'S WORTH $2 MILLION.
SO HE STANDS UP AND HE QUITS
RIGHT THEN AND THERE ON THE SPOT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE GRIN ON THAT MAN'S FACE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. "FORTUNE
SMILES AT SOME AND LAUGHS AT SOME OTHERS."
WHAT HAPPENS?
NEIGHBORS START COMING OUT OF THE
WOODWORK. THEY ASK FOR SMALL LOANS.
A WOMAN SHOWS UP CLAIMING TO
BE HIS MISTRESS. SHE WANTS HER CUT.
THAT DIDN'T SIT TOO
WELL WITH HIS WIFE.
SOMEONE THREATENS TO
KIDNAP HIS TEENAGE SON.
IT TURNS OUT THE SON
COOKED UP THE PLOT.
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS
BUSINESS WITH THE MOTHER-IN-LAW.
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE HE HAD ASKED
THE OLD LADY TO PRAY FOR HIS GOOD FORTUNE,
SO WOULDN'T YOU KNOW, SHE
CLAIMS HE WON THAT MONEY...
ON ACCOUNT OF
SOME CANDLES SHE LIT.
SO SHE FIGURES SHE'S ENTITLED TO
HALF OF IT, DECIDES TO TAKE HIM TO COURT.
BY THIS TIME, WHAT WITH MOST
OF HIS ASSETS TIED UP IN LITIGATION,
NOT TO MENTION ALL THE
SHAKEDOWNS AND BAD LOANS,
HE'S FLAT BROKE.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE COMES
CRAWLING BACK TO THE OFFICE.
HE WANTS HIS OLD JOB BACK.
HE WANTS ANY JOB BACK.
HE WANTS HIS OLD LIFE BACK.
SO, NOW YOU TELL ME, IF HIS HAPPINESS
WASN'T A CURSE, THEN WHAT WAS IT?
WELL, LOOK, THERE'S ONE
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE...
BETWEEN YOUR FRIEND AND MYSELF.
SEE, HE SEEMS LIKE HE
TRIED TO TAKE A SHORTCUT.
I EARNED IT. I WORKED HARD,
I PUT IN THE HOURS, I WENT TO
COURT, I FOUGHT WELL AND I WON.
MAYBE YOU JUST
GOT LUCKY THIS ONCE.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN LUCK.
LUCK IS A LAZY MAN'S EXCUSE.
SPOKEN LIKE A GUY THAT'S
HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD LUCK.
LET ME GUESS. PREP SCHOOL, YACHT
CLUB, TRIPS TO EUROPE IN THE SUMMER.
THAT SOUND ABOUT RIGHT?
LOTS OF SILVER SPOONS.
TELL YOU WHAT, MY FRIEND.
IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU.
NOW, UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GONNA SLIP BACK TO THE BOOTH WITH
MY FRIENDS AND DO A LITTLE CELEBRATING.
YOU GET HIM ANOTHER
ONE ON ME, PLEASE, PATRICK.
IT'S A FUNNY STORY, THOUGH.
SO WHO'S YOUR NEW
BEST FRIEND OVER THERE?
UH, HE'S A... HE'S A
BARSTOOL PREACHER.
GOT AHOLD OF AN
UNLUCKY LOTTERY TICKET.
WAS HE TRYING TO MAKE YOU FEEL
GUILTY FOR HAVING A GOOD TIME?
WELL, ABSOLUTELY NOT. 'CAUSE
WHAT DO WE SAY? WE SAY, "FUCK GUILT."
FUCK GUILT. WE HAVE DEALT
WITH ENOUGH OF THAT TODAY, MAN.

ALL RIGHT. Y'ALL HAVE A GOOD
ONE. WHERE YOU HEADING?
UH, MIDTOWN. I'LL
GIVE YOU A LIFT.
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
WHAT HE SAID WHEN ARRESTED.
HOW HE THREW HIMSELF ON THE GROUND AND
SHOUTED, "I CAN'T GO BACK. I CAN'T GO..."
"BACK." I KNOW. I FIGURED THE
JURY WOULD REMEMBER THAT TOO...
THAT HE'D BEEN IN PRISON BEFORE.
I HAD TO BRING OUT HIS PRIORS.
THE GUY'S A HABITUAL OFFENDER.
HE BELONGS IN JAIL.
THAT'S WHAT'S SO DAMN
BEAUTIFUL ABOUT OUR JOB, OWEN.
WE PROSECUTE THE GUILTY. WE HOLD
THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S
WHAT PEOPLE WANT.
THEY WANT AN EXAMPLE.
THEY WANT STRUCTURE.
SHOW THEM SOME CONCRETE
PROOF THAT THERE'S
SOME ORDER IN THIS WORLD,
YOU KNOW, SHOW THEM A SYSTEM
THAT CAN DETERMINE RIGHT FROM WRONG,
AND THEY'RE GONNA
SHOW US A BETTER SOCIETY.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE CAN GIVE THEM.
HEY. ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH. I'M FINE.
- WHAT, ARE YOU HUNGOVER OR...
- NO, I'M NOT FUCKING HUNGOVER.
I HAD TWO DRINKS AT
THE LOUSY BAR, OWEN.
I WASN'T COUNTING, MAN. TWO.
TWO LOUSY, WATERED-DOWN
FUCKING DRINKS.
I DON'T NEED MY
MOTHER HERE, ALL RIGHT?
I-I DIDN'T S...
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HEAD?
OHH. NOTHING, MAN.
IT'S MY OWN CLUMSINESS.
FUCK.
LOOK, MAN. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I'M SORRY ABOUT JUMPING ON
YOU. IT'S BEEN A LONG... WEEK.
IT'S OKAY. NO, I KNOW.
HOW'S YOUR
BUY-AND-BUST CASE GOING?
MAYBE YOU CAN GIMME A RIDE HOME,
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT
IT ON THE WAY, OR...
HEY, I CAN'T. WE'RE GONNA FIND
ANOTHER TIME. I DIDN'T DRIVE.
OKAY.
TROY, THE BUREAU CHIEF
WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY.
DID HE SAY WHAT IT'S ABOUT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S IN HIS OFFICE.
I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. ONE
THAT REQUIRES SPECIAL ATTENTION.
I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA TALK TO
YOU ABOUT TAKING SOME TIME OFF.
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT RIGHT NOW.
HERE'S THE HOMICIDE
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
HE'S GOT TWO PRIORS
FOR PETTY THEFT.
THIS ONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PETTY TOO,
IF THINGS HAD TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THE SUSPECT GRABBED A
CAMERA FROM SOME TOURIST.
THERE WAS A BRIEF STRUGGLE.
THE VICTIM FELL AND STRUCK
HIS HEAD ON THE GROUND.
DIED ALMOST INSTANTLY.
I'LL HAVE YOUR OTHER CASES
ASSIGNED TO SOMEONE ELSE.
BY THE WAY, I'VE RECOMMENDED
YOU FOR A PROMOTION.
WAIT, WAIT. WAIT. STO-STOP
HERE A MINUTE, WILL YOU?
YOU FIND WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR?
I DON'T KNOW.
DAMN. I FORGOT TO
TURN ON THE METER.
WELL, SMILE, WHY DON'T YOU?
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.
A CAR IS TRAVELING
AT 30 MILES PER HOUR...
WHEN HE SEES A
PEDESTRIAN 150 FEET AHEAD.
USING THIS EQUATION, WE FIND THAT
REDUCING THE VELOCITY TO ZERO...
REQUIRES A CONSTANT
DECELERATION OF...
6.45 FEET PER SECOND SQUARED.
DON'T YOU HAVE TO
ASSUME THE CAR'S VELOCITY
REMAINS CONSTANT DURING
THE DECELERATION PERIOD?
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. THE CONSTANT
IN THIS CASE IS, IN FACT, AN AVERAGE.
A BETTER EXAMPLE OF
NEARLY-CONSTANT ACCELERATION...
IS THE VERTICAL FREE FALL OF A
BODY NEAR THE EARTH'S SURFACE.
UH, A PAIR OF GLASSES DROPPED
FROM A BUILDING, FOR EXAMPLE.
ANYMORE QUESTIONS
BEFORE WE MOVE ON?
OKAY. NOW, LET'S TURN
OUR ATTENTION TO...
ENTROPY.
MR. HAMMOND.
TELL ME ABOUT THE MOVEMENT
OF AN ISOLATED MATERIAL SYSTEM...
FROM ONE STATE OF
EQUILIBRIUM TO ANOTHER.
JUST AS I THOUGHT. WELL,
LET ME ASK YOU THEN:
WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING, DO
YOU EXPECT YOUR BED TO MAKE ITSELF?
I WOULD IF I WAS IN A HOTEL.
PERHAPS SOMEONE ELSE WOULD
LIKE TO OFFER A BETTER EXAMPLE.
MR. AVERY. WHEN TWO GASSES MIX,
THE ENTROPY IS ALWAYS
GREATER THAN IT WAS
INITIALLY, AND IT CAN
NEVER, BY ITSELF, UNMIX.
EXACTLY. IT CAN NEVER GO BACK...
TO THE WAY IT WAS.
OHH. YOU LOOK SO SERIOUS.
OH. I WAS JUST THINKING.
ABOUT WHAT? HOW MUCH MY
LIFE HAS CHANGED SINCE WE MET.
I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D BE
LIVING IN ONE ROOM OUT OF A SUITCASE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN BACK TO YOUR
PLACE YET TO GET THE
REST OF YOUR THINGS.
MAYBE I'LL JUST GET
NEW THINGS. START OVER.
IT'S A SIMPLE LIGHT REFRACTION
THROUGH A CONVERGING LENS.
OH. I FORGOT TO TURN IT OFF.
DOES YOUR HUSBAND EVER WONDER...
WHY YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR
OFFICE ON CERTAIN AFTERNOONS?
HE'S NEVER ASKED ME.
WHAT WOULD HE
DO IF HE FOUND OUT?
UH, I'M NOT SURE.
WHEN HE WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED,
HE TOLD ME HE'D UNDERSTAND...
IF I SOUGHT
COMPANIONSHIP ELSEWHERE.
YES, BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM.
PEOPLE OFTEN LIE TO
MAKE OTHERS HAPPY.
LOOK, HIS HEALTH IS IMPROVING.
WHY SHOULD HE BE
TORMENTED DOUBTING HIMSELF?
IGNORANCE IS BLISS, IS THAT IT?
MAYBE HE'S BETTER OFF
LIVING UNDER AN ILLUSION.

MY MOM WAS SICK THAT DAY, SO A
NEIGHBOR TOOK ME TO THE BEACH AND...
I JUST SAT ON THE PIER WITH HER
IN MY LAP WATCHING THE WATER...
AND THE SUN, THE WAY IT WAS
SHINING ON IT, IT KINDA LOOKED LIKE FIRE.
SO I REACHED DOWN AND I
TRIED TO TOUCH IT WITH MY TOES...
AND THEN I FELL IN.
A MAN HAD TO JUMP
IN AND SAVE ME.
WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?
IT ROTTED. AND HER
ONE EYE GOT STUCK.
KINDA LOOKS LIKE SHE'S WINKING.
IT'S A SIGN.
I SHOULD'VE DROWN
THAT DAY, BUT I DIDN'T.
OH! OH, I WAS GONNA
GIVE YOU, UM, SOMETHING...
THAT I GOT FROM THE
RUDOLPHS FOR YOU.
OH, WOW!
THANK YOU. MM-HMM.
OH. GREECE. I THINK THEY
WENT THERE A FEW MONTHS AGO.
I THINK THEY GO THERE A LOT. THEY GO TO A
LOT OF PLACES. THEY GOT TOO MUCH MONEY.
YEAH. THEY SLEEP IN
SEPARATE BEDROOMS. YEAH.
THEY PROBABLY BOTH

NOTHING BETTER TO DO WITH THEIR MONEY.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU

I'D PROBABLY GIVE YOU SOME.
HEY. I HAD TO SIT. MY

QUITE LOW ENOUGH.
THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION
IS TO RAISE THE PREMIUMS.

THEY'VE COME UP WITH
SOME ANSWERS IN THIS AREA.
I'M WONDERING IF WE OUGHT TO
REEXAMINE OUR POLICY STANDARDS.
JUST STOP INSURING PROPERTY IN
CERTAIN AREAS OF TOWN ALTOGETHER.
FORGIVE ME, BUT THE SITUATION WE'RE IN HAS
GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH POLICY STANDARDS.
THE REASON OUR RATING
FELL IS BECAUSE WE'RE

I HAVE A FEELING THAT A LOT OF OTHER
HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL BEFORE THIS IS OVER.
WELL, THAT MAKES ME
FEEL A LITTLE BETTER.
I MEAN, NOT THAT I WOULD
WISH IT ON ANYONE ELSE. YEAH.
I'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOU
STAY OUT THE WEEK...
AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT A NICE SEVERANCE PACKAGE.
THANKS, GENE. I APPRECIATE IT.
HUH.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD
LOOK AT THE UPSIDE OF THIS.
I CAN TAKE THAT VACATION
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.
SPEND SOME TIME WITH MY KIDS
BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE NEST.
GOOD NIGHT, GENE.
YEAH. GOOD NIGHT.
SEE YOU TOMORROW, DICK. BYE.
DON'T TELL ME. YOU LOST
YOUR NERVE. COULDN'T DO IT.
NO. IT'S OVER. IT'S DONE. NOW, HE WALKED
OUT THAT DOOR WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE.
HE WAS DEFINITELY SMILING WHEN HE
WALKED OUT THAT DOOR AND SAID GOOD NIGHT.
YEAH. YOU WON. FOR A MINUTE
I THOUGHT I HAD HIM THERE.
BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE HE PUTS ON THOSE
ROSE-COLORED GLASSES. IT WAS ALL OVER.
IF ONLY HE'D THROWN HIMSELF ON MY MERCY, I
COULD HAVE AT LEAST HAD SOME PITY FOR HIM.
HERE YOU GO.
NAH. YOU, UH... YOU DON'T
HAVE TO PAY ME, YOU KNOW.
SUIT YOURSELF.
GOOD NIGHT, GENE.
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
330-HORSEPOWER ENGINE,
236 POUNDS OF TORQUE...
AND TOP SPEED OF 1-3-7.
SO IT CAN GO FROM 0 TO 60
IN ABOUT 4.8 SECONDS THEN?
YEAH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING, UH,
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT?
I DON'T DRIVE ANYMORE.
THANK YOU.
WHAT DOES A YOUNG MAN LIKE
YOURSELF DO TO AFFORD A CAR LIKE THIS?
IT WAS A GIFT FROM MY PARENTS.
I WORK AT THE D.A.'s OFFICE.
MUST BE QUITE FRUSTRATING
DEALING WITH CRIME IN THE CITY.
I WAS HELD UP AT
GUNPOINT RECENTLY.
GUY TOOK MY WALLET AND
COLDCOCKED ME FOR NO REASON.
GAVE ME A REAL SHINER.
COULD HAVE EASILY
HAVE KILLED ME.
THAT GUY THAT MUGGED
YOU, THEY EVER CATCH HIM?
I DOUBT IF ANYONE'S
EVEN LOOKING FOR HIM.
LIFE GOES ON. I'VE SUFFERED
MY SHARE AND NOW IT'S OVER.
EVEN MY EYE HAS HEALED.
IN TIME, IT'LL BE AS
THOUGH IT NEVER HAPPENED.
AH!
- OH.
- OH, EXCUSE ME.
I-I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE SOMEONE
ELSE. I'M SORRY IF I WOKE YOU.
YOU'RE BLEEDING.
LET ME BANDAGE IT FOR YOU.
A WEEK AGO HE WAS
ROBBED AT GUNPOINT.
THE NEXT DAY I GOT A PHONE CALL.
A MAN FOUND HIS
WALLET IN A TRASH CAN.
HE DELIVERED IT THE SAME DAY,
BUT I NEVER BOTHERED
TO TELL MY HUSBAND.
THERE WERE THINGS
INSIDE THE WALLET...
THAT INDICATE HE'S
HAVING AN AFFAIR.
DO YOU MIND IF I SMOKE? NO.
DID YOU, UM, CONFRONT HIM?
NO. I WAS WAITING
FOR HIM TO MENTION IT,
TO SAY SOMETHING, TO LIE.
YOU SEEM SO CALM.
MAYBE I'VE JUST GOTTEN
USED TO FEELING ALONE.
I WAS THINKING ON MY WAY
HOME FROM WORK HOW...
STRANGE IT IS TO LIVE IN A
CITY SO CROWDED WITH PEOPLE...
ALL TRYING HARD NOT
TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
SELF-PROTECTION, I IMAGINE.
I READ ABOUT A STUDY
ONCE THAT SAID...
HUMAN BEINGS REQUIRE 18
INCHES OF PERSONAL SPACE.
SILLY, ISN'T IT?
TO PUT A NUMBER ON
IT LIKE THAT. 18 INCHES.
STILL, YOU KNOW,
UNDERNEATH IT ALL,
MAYBE WE WANT THE SAME THINGS.
MAYBE WE'RE MORE
CONNECTED THAN WE KNOW.
DO YOU THINK SO?
I'M SURE YOUR HUSBAND
WILL COME TO HIS SENSES.
ASK YOURSELF IF YOU'RE
HAPPY AND YOU CEASE TO BE SO.
TONIGHT, BEFORE HE LEFT, IT TOOK HIM NEARLY
AN HOUR JUST TO PACK A SMALL SUITCASE.
FINALLY, I HAD TO DO IT FOR HIM.
THAT SHOULD BE IT THEN.
THE SUITCASE AND SHOPPING
BAG I'LL TAKE WITH ME.
THE ADDRESS IS ON THE
TAG. I'LL MEET YOU THERE.
WHAT ABOUT THESE BOXES?
THOSE ARE FOR CHARITY.
LISTEN. I SPOKE WITH
THE ATTORNEY LAST NIGHT.
HE SAID IF WE CAN GET
RONNIE IN SOME KIND OF
REHABILITATION, THEY
MIGHT GO EASIER ON HIM.
I DON'T CARE WHAT DEL
HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT.
MONTHLY P & L. THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT.
I'M ON THE PHONE WITH MY EX.
I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN UNDER THE GUN. THE
INSURANCE COMPANY DROPPED OUR RATING.
WAIT A MINUTE. I DIDN'T SAY
I WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB.
I'M NOT PEDDLING BALLPOINT
PENS FOR DEL STRICKLAND.
TELL HIM THANKS, BUT I
DON'T NEED ANY FAVORS.
IT'S ENOUGH HE'S
TRYING TO RAISE MY SON.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.
I GUESS I WAS BUSY WORKING
MY WAY UP FROM THE BOTTOM...
AND I DIDN'T HAVE A COMPANY HANDED
TO ME BY MY OLD MAN LIKE DEL DID.
WHAT? IT'S TAKEN ME
YEARS TO GET WHERE I AM.
WELL, FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I'M
ABOUT TO BE MADE VICE PRESIDENT.
♪♪
WHO'S WHISTLING? ME.
JUST TRYING TO LIGHTEN THINGS UP AROUND
HERE. A LITTLE TRIBUTE TO SMILEY BOWMAN.
KNOCK IT OFF. I CAN'T
HEAR MYSELF THINK.
COME ON. IT'S JUST A JOKE. YOU HAVEN'T
CRACKED A SMILE SINCE BOWMAN LEFT.
SPEAKING OF BOWMAN, I COULD USE
ONE OF HIS WIFE'S COOKIES ABOUT NOW.
WE'RE NOT RUNNING A
SNACK BAR HERE, PETE.
YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT SMILEY? I
SAW HIM THE OTHER DAY AT PENN STATION.
HAD ON A SUIT AND TIE.
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER, I'D
FIGURE HE'S ON HIS WAY TO WORK.
POOR GUY. RUMOR HAS IT HE
HASN'T EVEN TOLD HIS WIFE YET.
APPARENTLY, HE'S BEEN
COMING INTO THE CITY
EVERY DAY TO HAVE
COFFEE AND READ THE PAPER.
WHAT'S A GUY GONNA DO?
HE'S OVER 50 YEARS OLD.
NOT EXACTLY A
MARKETABLE COMMODITY.
I UNDERSTAND HE'S GOT A LOT OF ONE-
AND TWO-YEAR STINTS ON HIS RÉSUMÉ.
THAT DOESN'T HELP
MATTERS ANY. LUCKY
IF HE COULD GET A JOB
BAGGING GROCERIES.
THEY'RE USING KIDS
FOR THAT TOO. YEAH.
OR SENIORS.
HI. I'M LOOKING FOR RONNIE.
HI. HE'S OUT. BE BACK LATER.
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN?
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. HE JUST LEFT.
DO YOU WANT ME TO GIVE
HIM A MESSAGE OR SOMETHING?
YEAH, TELL HIM GENE,
HIS FATHER, CAME BY.
UH, WOULD YOU MIND
GIVING HIM THESE?
THANKS.
UH, TELL HIM I'LL SEE HIM
ON WEDNESDAY, OKAY?
HI, GUS. UM, I DON'T
KNOW. SAME OLD, SAME OLD.
GENE? GENE ENGLISH? HOW
HAVE YOU BEEN? HOW ARE YOU?
CAN I BUY YOU A CUP OF
COFFEE? NO, I-I-I GOTTA...
COME ON. JUST FOR A MINUTE. HOW
ABOUT SOMETHING TO EAT? I-I JUST ATE.
SOMEBODY LEFT THIS
IN THE BACK BOOTH.
I SAVED THE WANT ADS
FOR YOU. THANKS, GUS.
SO HOW'S THE... HOW'S
THE JOB HUNT GOING?
OH, YOU KNOW, TAKES TIME. HOW ARE
THINGS WITH YOU BACK AT THE OFFICE?
OH, YOU KNOW, SAME
OLD BUDGETARY CRUNCH.
THAT COMPANY IS LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU. WELL...
ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE
THIS. DON'T LET IT GET YOU DOWN.
THESE SITUATIONS
HAVE A WAY OF TURNING
THEMSELVES AROUND. I
REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT.
I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO YOUR
LUNCH. I GOTTA GO TO THE OFFICE.
I'M GLAD WE RAN INTO
EACH OTHER. YEAH.
MUST HAVE BEEN
FATE. YEAH, RIGHT.
HEY, DICK. NOW, LISTEN...
YOU WANT IN ON A GAME OF POKER FOR
TONIGHT? OUR REGULAR GUY, HE CAN'T MAKE IT.
I THINK HIS DAUGHTER'S GOT
THE MEASLES OR SOMETHING.
CAN'T. MOTHER-IN-LAW'S
IN TOWN. MMM.
CAN I INTEREST YOU IN A
GAME OF POKER TONIGHT, GENE?
ARE WE ALL BRACED
FOR THE BIG SHAKE-UP?
WHAT BIG SHAKE-UP?
TALKING ABOUT MOVING UPSTAIRS. TALKING
ABOUT SQUEEZING INTO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT.
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THIS FROM?
MY SECRETARY FRIEND UP ON 35.
HEY, I DIDN'T THINK
THIS WAS A BIG SECRET.
I MEAN, THEY'RE PLANNING TO MAKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN THIS NEW V.P. TAKES OVER.
AND THEY'RE PLANNING TO MAKE US
WORK LONGER HOURS... WHAT NEW V.P.?
THAT MANAGER FROM
THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT.
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING...
WHAT'S HIS NAME? T-THE YOUNG GUY...
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO THAN
SITTING AROUND FLAPPING YOUR GUMS ALL DAY?
OKAY, THAT'S IT FOR ME. I'LL
FINISH MY LUNCH AT MY DESK.
YEAH, GO TO YOUR DESK, AND DO
SOME WORK THERE WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
INSTEAD OF POKING YOUR NOSE IN OTHER
PEOPLE'S BUSINESS, YOU PATHETIC LOSER.
YEAH, I'M A LOSER.
THAT'S RIGHT, GENE.
I HAD A GOOD TEACHER.
ACTUALLY, I LEARNED A
FEW THINGS FROM YOU.
YOU GOT THE GUYS IN THE
LEATHER SWIVEL CHAIRS.
YOU GOT MIDDLE-MANAGEMENT
ASS KISSERS.
AND THEN YOU GOT
YOUR SCAPEGOATS.
THE GUYS WHO GET CANNED
WITHOUT A DIME OF SEVERANCE.
- WISDOM COMES SUDDENLY,
DOESN'T IT?
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
WHY YOU LET HIM GET
TO YOU LIKE THAT, GENE?
I MEAN, WHY YOU LOOK AT
EVERYONE LIKE THEY'RE YOUR ENEMY?
MICKEY... IS WHO HE IS. HE'S JUST A GUY
LIKE THE REST OF US, TRYING TO GET BY.
W-WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY FROM FINANCE?
IT'S ALL JUST HEARSAY ANYWAY. I DON'T TRUST
THE RUMORS. I DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION...
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'?
MR. STRICKLAND WILL SEE YOU NOW.
HELLO, GENE. HOW YOU DOING, DEL?
GOOD.
NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE. THAT
WHERE YOUR FATHER USED TO SIT?
NO, HE, UH, PASSED ON
BEFORE WE MOVED UP HERE.
OH, SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
LOOK, UH, I DON'T WANNA
TAKE A LOT OF YOUR TIME.
I'M JUST HERE TO SEE IF YOU MIGHT
HAVE AN OPENING IN YOUR SALES FORCE?
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU, IF
THERE'S ANYTHING I COULD
DO FOR YOU, I'D BE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO DO IT.
I KNOW WHAT A HARD WORKER YOU
ARE AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.
NO, NO, THIS IS NOT FOR ME. I'M
HERE ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S BEHALF.
A GUY NAMED WADE BOWMAN.
HE'S A HELL OF A GUY AND A TERRIFIC WORKER.
HE'S HAD A STRING OF BAD LUCK LATELY.
AND I THOUGHT, WELL,
HE COULD USE A LEG UP.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE, UH, GOT LAID OFF?
YEAH, YOU KNOW THE
DRILL. OFFICE POLITICS. HMM.
YOU KNOW, ROSE'S GONNA BE AT
RONNIE'S COURT DATE TOMORROW.
IF YOU WANT, I COULD...
IT'S OKAY. I CAN
TAKE CARE OF IT.
WELL, THANKS FOR THE
LEAD. I'LL GIVE THE GUY A CALL.
TERRIFIC. I THINK THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR EACH OTHER.
AND PROBABLY BETTER IF YOU
DON'T LET HIM KNOW I CAME UP HERE.
HE'S GOT A LOT OF PRIDE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
SURE.
WHAT'S THE NEXT AVAILABLE DATE?
JANUARY THE 6th.
THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK
VERSUS RONALD JAMES ENGLISH.
DO YOU WAIVE
READING THE CHARGES?
SO WAIVED.
I NEED AN ADJOURNMENT. MY CLIENT'S NOT
HERE AND I'M HAVING TROUBLE LOCATING HIM.
I'LL FIND HIM FOR YOU. THE COURT HEREBY
ISSUES A BENCH WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
STAYING THAT, YOUR HONOR?
I'LL CONSIDER IT,
BUT I WON'T DO IT.
BENCH WARRANT ISSUED.
COME ON IN. YOU
DON'T HAVE TO KNOCK.
IT'S ALL THERE IN
BLACK AND WHITE.
SAYS WE HAVE TO BE OFF THIS
FLOOR BY THE END OF THE MONTH.
THEY WANT US TO MOVE DOWN TO 33.
SHARE SPACE WITH...
UNDERWRITING AND SALES.
BULL PENS. WE CAN KISS
OUR WINDOWS GOOD-BYE.
HOW LONG YOU BEEN WORKING HERE?
FOURTEEN YEARS IN JANUARY.
WERE YOU HERE WHEN
EDDIE JASPER CRACKED UP?
NO, THAT WAS BEFORE MY TIME. I
THINK I HEARD ABOUT HIM, THOUGH.
THAT'S THE GUY WHO... WENT TO PIECES
IN THE MIDDLE OF A MEETING, RIGHT?
YEAH, HAD TO TAKE HIM
AWAY IN AN AMBULANCE.
RIGHT AT A TIME WHEN THINGS SEEMED TO BE
GOING WELL FOR HIM. ON THE OUTSIDE ANYWAY.
CAME IN. HE DID HIS WORK.
HE TALKED ABOUT HIS FAMILY.
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS HE HAD ANOTHER WIFE
AND SET OF KIDS RIGHT ACROSS THE HUDSON.
HE WANTED IT ALL,
AND HE GOT IT ALL.
TIMES TWO.
IT'S LIKE THE OLD GYPSY CURSE,
"MAY YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT."
YEAH, GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT.
BUT TAKE IT AND PAY FOR IT.
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
OH, MY GOOD GOD! YOU ALL RIGHT?
I WON! I WON! THE LOTTERY?
I WON! I WON IT!
OH, GOD, EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN GOING
DOWN TO THAT NEWSSTAND EVERY DAY.
HOW MUCH? HOW MUCH? HOW MUCH?
FINALLY HIT IT!
TWO MILLION BUCKS!
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
WHATCHA GONNA DO
WITH ALL THAT MONEY, MAN?
I DON'T KNOW. WAIT A
MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DO I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO WITH THE MONEY?
I KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I DON'T HAVE TO WORK
ANOTHER DAY IN MY LIFE. NO!
I NEVER HAVE TO SET FOOT IN
THIS PLACE AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE!
OH, YEAH! OH! OH, YEAH.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
GENE. YOU LISTEN TO ME.
YOU TAKE A GOOD LOOK.
THIS... IS WHAT A
WINNER LOOKS LIKE.
THIS... IS WHAT IT
REALLY LOOKS LIKE.
TAKE A GOOD LONG LAST
LOOK, 'CAUSE I AM OUT OF HERE.
GOOD-BYE.
OH!
OH, GOODNESS! OH, THERE
IS A GOD. LET ME TELL YOU.
BYE-BYE, GENE.
WELL, I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS.
MY, UM, ROOMMATE BROKE UP WITH HER
BOYFRIEND, SO I DON'T GOTTA MOVE OUT.
WHAT A DUMB FUCK.
HE STOLE OUR TV.
HOW'S WORK GOING?
MRS. TURNER MADE ANOTHER
COMPLAINT ABOUT ME.
SHE SAYS I CHIPPED ONE OF HER
STUPID FIGURINES OR SOMETHING.
BITCH.
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA COME BACK?
I MISS YOU. IT'S, LIKE, TOTALLY
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
THE AGENCY SAYS I CAN'T WORK
AGAIN UNTIL I GET MY CAST OFF, SO...
SHE'S LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.
THE DOCTOR SAYS A
MIRACLE SHE SURVIVED.
YEAH. SOMEBODY'S
WATCHING OUT OVER HER.
AND HOW'S THE ARCHITECT DOING?
STOPPED THE SERVICE. YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T
WANT US THERE WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE.
I PUT THE BOXES WITH SOME
OF YOUR THINGS IN YOUR ROOM.
AND THE REST OF THE
STUFF I PUT IN THE GARAGE.
OKAY.
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.
I TRIED TO GET ONE THAT WOULD
MATCH YOUR REAL HAIR COLOR.
I HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT A WIG YET.
THANK YOU. THANK
YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME.
OH, IT'S SO GOOD TO
HAVE YOU BACK, HONEY.
MMM.
DID THEY GIVE YOU BACK
EVERYTHING AT THE HOSPITAL?
JUST WHAT WAS IN THAT BAG.
SOME OF THE CLOTHES YOU WERE
WEARING WERE RUINED, SO I THREW THEM OUT.
NOTHING'S MISSING, IS IT? NO.
THESE ARE A FIRE HAZARD.
THIS IS AN OLD HOUSE, YOU KNOW.
I'M GONNA GO DOWNSTAIRS, OKAY?
WELL, WHAT A SURPRISE.
I, UM... I BROUGHT
YOUR SHIRT BACK.
I'M SORRY IT TOOK
SO LONG. YEAH...
I, UH, HEARD ABOUT
YOUR ACCIDENT.
UM, I'M HOPING I CAN
COME BACK TO WORK SOON.
UH, LISTEN, THE LAST
TIME YOU WERE HERE,
I REALIZED WHEN I GOT TO WORK
THAT I'D LEFT, UH, MY WATCH BY THE SINK.
IT WAS A GIFT.
OH, YEAH. I PUT IT IN THE
DRAWER SO IT WOULDN'T GET WET.
I FOR... I'LL SHOW IT...
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
I'M SORRY. I MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN
TO PUT IT BACK AFTER I CLEANED.
OH! OH, GOD.
OH, I'M SORRY. I JUST
ASSUMED THAT YOU OR THE...
I MEAN, YOU KNOW...
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ANYWAY?
A CAR HIT ME.
WHY?
I GUESS I WAS IN THE WAY.
I WAS JUST HEADING
OUT TO THE STORE.
COME ON IN.
BEATRICE! YOUR FRIEND IS HERE!
GO AHEAD. BYE-BYE.
HI. HEY.
YOU GUYS ARE OUT HERE. IT
TOOK ME FOREVER TO GET HERE.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME. YEAH.
THEY LAID ME OFF.
I HAD TO TALK TO YOU
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT...
I DON'T KNOW. SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING.
MADE A COMPLAINT OR SOMETHING.
PRETTY SURE IT WAS
THAT BITCH, MRS. TURNER.
SO NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
LIFE ISN'T FAIR.
WHAT?
I SAID LIFE ISN'T FAIR.
YOU WERE RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
THAT FOR? BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.
THE ARCHITECT THOUGHT
I STOLE HIS WATCH. NO, NO.
THAT GUY IS AN IDIOT AND YOU
WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING...
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT.
BECAUSE I WAS BLAMED FOR IT.
I'VE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT...
ABOUT WHY I GOT
HIT BY THAT CAR...
AND WHY I WAS STANDING ON
THAT CORNER AT THAT MOMENT.
WHY THAT...
WHY THAT WHITE SHIRT
BLEW OUT OF MY HANDS.
AND THEN I REALIZED...
THERE IS NO REASON.
WELL, I JUST THINK THAT,
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA BE AROUND THE CORNER.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY. YOU
WERE ALWAYS TELLING ME THAT.
BUT MY EYES HAVE BEEN
OPENED. I CAN NEVER GO BACK.
Y-YOU CHANGED.
YOU'RE REAL DIFFERENT.
I'M NOT DIFFERENT.
I'M LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
SOME OF THE GUYS ARE
GETTING TOGETHER LATER.
GOING OUT FOR A DRINK.
YOU WANNA JOIN US?
NO, THANKS. BUT I GOT
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO CALL
YOU SAINT TROY BEHIND YOUR BACK.
THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO ACCEPT...
THE PLEA THE D.A. HAS OFFERED.
IF NOT, THIS CASE WILL
BE SENT OUT FOR TRIAL.
YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENT
MAINTAINS HIS PLEA OF NOT GUILTY.
WHEN'S SENTENCING?
IT'S NEXT MONDAY.
THIS JUDGE IS TOUGH. HE'S
LIKELY TO GIVE HIM THE MAX.
PROBABLY. MM-HMM.
HE TOOK A HUMAN LIFE.
HE HAS TO BE PUNISHED.
W-WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT?
ALL DAY WHEN...
I THINK OF THAT MAN I KILLED.
I HAD A JOB INTERVIEW LINED UP,
BUT IT WAS RAINING.
AND THE TRAINS WERE CROWDED.
I SAW THREE TRAINS GO BY,
AND I COULDN'T SQUEEZE IN.
AFTER A WHILE, I KNEW I
HAD MISSED MY CHANCE.
THAT'S WHEN I WENT
FOR THE CAMERA.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT THAT GUY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO
MYSELF EVERY SINGLE DAY?
I SAY,
"IF ONLY IT HADN'T RAINED.
IF ONLY IT HADN'T RAINED."
WELL, I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
WRONG WITH YOU PHYSICALLY.
GIVEN THE, UH, SYMPTOMS YOU
DESCRIBED, I SUSPECT IT WAS A PANIC ATTACK.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
I'M NOT THE TYPE TO PANIC.
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY
CHANGES IN YOUR LIFE RECENTLY?
YES. A FEW.
AND?
THEY'VE BEEN POSITIVE
FOR THE MOST PART.
BUT I STILL... FEEL
UNSATISFIED SOMEHOW.
LIKE I'M MISSING SOMETHING.
I KEEP ASKING MYSELF,
"IS THAT ALL THERE IS?
TO MERELY EXIST."
WHAT IS IT, UH,
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?
I'M NOT EVEN SURE ANYMORE.
SOMETIMES I, UH...
I LOOK AT MY STUDENTS'
FACES, AND I SEE, UH,
A SENSE OF WONDER, A ZEST FOR LIFE,
WHEN THEY'RE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW.
SURELY YOU MUST GET SOME
SATISFACTION THEN IN TEACHING THEM?
IT'S NOT THE SAME.
I ALREADY KNOW IT.
YES?
UH, MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?
MY OFFICE HOURS ARE BETWEEN
3:00 AND 5:00 ON MONDAYS.
YEAH, I WAS, UH... I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF I COULD TAKE THE EXAM OVER.
I DIDN'T DO AS
WELL AS I COULD'VE.
I HAVEN'T FINISHED GRADING THEM.
MAYBE YOU DID BETTER THAN YOU THINK.
UM, IT'S KINDA IMPORTANT.
I GOTTA PASS THIS CLASS
TO GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL.
YET YOU SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME
IN CLASS TRYING TO GAIN ATTENTION.
AND YOU'VE BEEN LATE
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.
YOU MAKE CERTAIN CHOICES, YOU
HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.
T-THERE'S THINGS GOING ON IN MY
LIFE RIGHT NOW. PERSONAL PROBLEMS.
I HAVEN'T BEEN
SLEEPING AND, UH...
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I, WE
BROKE UP. CAUSE AND EFFECT.
THE THIRD LAW OF MOTION.
IS PROFESSOR TATE AROUND?
UH, SHE WON'T BE IN TODAY.
SHE HAD SOME SORT
OF FAMILY EMERGENCY.
I SEE. THANK YOU.
IT'S NOT WORKING. IN FACT, IT SEEMS
TO BE HAVING THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.
I CAN PRESCRIBE
SOMETHING ELSE, BUT I'M NOT
SURE IF IT'S THE ANSWER
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
IT'S PERVERSE, ISN'T IT?
PEOPLE SPEND YEARS DEVELOPING
THEIR MINDS, EDUCATING THEMSELVES.
AND IN THE END, THEY JUST
WANT TO SHUT THEM OFF.
THE OTHER NIGHT, I FOUND MYSELF IN
FRONT OF MY OLD APARTMENT BUILDING.
I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE SINCE
MY WIFE AND I SEPARATED.
WERE YOU ANY HAPPIER THEN?
I WAS... CONTENT, I SUPPOSE.
SO WHY DID YOU LEAVE?
I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF CONTENTMENT
AS A FORM OF RESIGNATION,
OF ACCEPTING THE STATUS QUO.
IT MEANS YOU'VE GIVEN UP.
I'M NOT READY TO SURRENDER.
MAYBE I'LL GO BACK. I-I
CAN'T SAY RIGHT NOW,
BUT I KNOW I'LL SEE MY
WIFE AGAIN SOMETIME.
I STILL HAVE ALL OF
MY THINGS THERE.
WE CAN DETERMINE THE
RANGE, "R," WITH THIS EQUATION.
AN OBJECT PROJECTED HORIZONTALLY WILL
REACH THE GROUND AT THE SAME INSTANT...
AS THE FREE FALLING ONE
DROPPED FROM THE SAME HEIGHT.
EVEN IF ONE OF THEM
IS SIGNIFICANTLY...
THERE ARE NO IFS. PHYSICS
IS AN EXACT SCIENCE.
THE LAWS OF THE
UNIVERSE ARE ABSOLUTE.
HE KNOWS.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T WANT
TO GO ON LIVING WITHOUT ME.
I SEE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
CAN YOU SAY THE SAME THING?
UH, HEY, PROFESSOR, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WERE FINISHED GRADING THE EXAMS.
I'LL BE HANDING THEM BACK ON MONDAY. YOU
CAN SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT FOR AFTERWARDS.
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME
ANY INDICATION AS TO WHETHER I PASSED?
I CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO
REMEMBER EVERY GRADE.
YEAH, DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN LOOK THEM UP?
WHY DO YOU WANT TO
BE A DOCTOR ANYHOW?
SO I CAN HELP PEOPLE. HOW?
BY KEEPING THEM ALIVE TODAY SO YOU CAN
PROLONG THEIR MISERY UNTIL TOMORROW?
I SEE MR. HAMMOND
IS LATE AGAIN. HMM?
UM...
THERE WAS A PARTY LAST NIGHT.
HE FELL FROM THE TOP OF THE
MATH BUILDING ONTO THE QUAD.
NO, HE DIDN'T. THE
RANGE IS TOO GREAT.
IF HE HAD FALLEN, HE WOULD'VE LANDED
NEAR THE BUSHES. HE MUST HAVE JUMPED.
WOULDN'T THAT BE
RIGHT, PROFESSOR?
A NEIGHBOR FOUND
HIM IN HIS APARTMENT.
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN. I SUPPOSE HE
JUST COULDN'T LIVE WITH THE SECRET ANYMORE.
WELL, WHY DID YOU SEND FOR ME?
THE NOTE HE LEFT WAS
ADDRESSED TO YOU.
HE WANTED YOU TO TAKE
CARE OF SOMETHING FOR HIM.
YOU'RE BACK.
I JUST GOT HERE.
I MUST HAVE BEEN DREAMING.
YOU HEARD WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU HAD BLOOD POISONING
FROM THE CUT ON YOUR HEAD.
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
YOUR NOTE SOUNDS LIKE A WILL.
YOU'RE GIVING AWAY
EVERYTHING YOU OWN.
WELL, I WANT TO GIVE
SOMETHING TO THE VICTIM'S FAMILY.
MAKE AMENDS.
WHAT IF YOU COULD DO
SOMETHING FOR THE GIRL?
I WISH I COULD.
YOU CAN.
HOW CAN THAT BE?
I LEFT HER.
SOMETIMES... PEOPLE
JUST GET LUCKY.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE.
DORRIE!
HEY!
HEY. I, UM...
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
YOU. YOUR HAIR GREW.
WHY DID YOU STOP CALLING ME?
I DON'T KNOW. I, UM...
I JUST FELT...
I FELT BAD FOR YOU
AFTER... THE ACCIDENT.
BUT, I DON'T KNOW, YOU WERE
JUST HARD TO BE AROUND.
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE
ONE THAT MADE THINGS RIGHT.
FOR A WHILE, I JUST...
I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING GOOD,
NO MATTER WHERE I LOOKED.
AND ONE DAY, I JUST
COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
I WAS IN, UM...
I WAS IN MIDTOWN
AT RUSH HOUR, AND...
IT WAS NOISY AND CROWDED, AND...
EVERYBODY WAS PUSHING
EACH OTHER, AND...
THEY WERE JUST
TRAPPED, YOU KNOW?
SOMEONE BUMPED ME FROM BEHIND
AND I JUST DECIDED, YOU KNOW, THAT'S IT.
I GIVE UP.
I WAS STANDING ON THE
CORNER, WATCHING THE TRAFFIC,
THINKING OF HOW
EASY IT WOULD BE.
JUST A FEW SMALL STEPS.
THAT MAYBE IT SHOULD
HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE.
MAYBE THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE MY FATE.
I PICKED SOMEONE OUT
ACROSS THE STREET.
SOMEONE TO LOOK AT. SOMEONE...
SOMEONE WHO'D GIVE ME A
REASON TO DO IT, YOU KNOW?
SO I PICKED THIS MAN
AND I STARED AT HIS FACE.
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT
HOW... SELFISH PEOPLE WERE.
HOW MISERABLE AND...
PREDICTABLE AND...
I SWEAR, THAT MAN, HE MUST HAVE READ MY
MIND, BECAUSE HE LOOKED RIGHT BACK AT ME...
AND SMILED.
JUST LIKE THAT, HE
BROKE THE SPELL.
I'M GLAD YOU
PICKED HIM. SO AM I.
HOW ARE YOU? HELLO!
GENE ENGLISH. HOW
ARE YOU, OLD FRIEND?
HELLO THERE, WADE.
HOW YOU DOING?
OH, I'VE BEEN GREAT. I GOT
A JOB IN SALES AND I LOVE IT.
I'M AN ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE
FOR AN OFFICE SUPPLY COMPANY.
BEEN THERE OVER A
YEAR NOW. WONDERFUL.
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. I GOT A
PHONE CALL ONE DAY OUT OF THE BLUE.
PRESIDENT OF THE
COMPANY CALLED ME HIMSELF.
SAID HE HEARD ABOUT ME FROM SOME
HEADHUNTER. KNEW I WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB.
OH, THINGS COULDN'T
HAVE WORKED OUT BETTER.
YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU WERE
BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR.
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DESERVE IT.
GENE, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU.
THINKING ABOUT PAYING A CALL ON YOU.
MAYBE SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING
IN THE WAY OF OFFICE SUPPLIES.
BUT I WASN'T SURE IF THINGS
WERE STILL, WELL, YOU KNOW...
HERE.
LET ME GIVE YOU MY... CARD.
WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER
SOMETIME FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.
GENE, SORRY I'M LATE.
MEETING LASTED
LONGER THAN I EXPECTED.
WHAT IS IT WE'RE
CELEBRATING ANYWAY?
ARE WE CELEBRATING?
I JUST GOT DOWNSIZED.
I GOT EASED OUT.
I HOPE YOU'RE STICKING
THEM FOR THE FULL PACKAGE.
IT'LL BE MY GREAT PLEASURE. ♪♪
MY FRIEND AT THE
BAR ON THE CORNER...
FOR YOU, MY FRIEND.

I'LL HAVE PLENTY OF
TIME TO WORK ON IT.
MAYBE I CAN ALSO
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO...
GET MYSELF NOMINATED
FATHER OF THE YEAR.
SPEAKING OF WHICH...
GUESS WHO I RAN INTO. ♪ WIPE
OFF THAT FULL-OF-DOUBT LOOK ♪
♪ SLAP ON A HAPPY GRIN ♪
THE WORLD REALLY IS TOO SMALL.
SO, UH, HE'S STILL
WORKING FOR YOUR
EX-WIFE'S HUSBAND?
LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF IT.
WELL, NATURALLY. DID YOU LET
ON IT WAS YOU WHO GOT IT FOR HIM?
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY...
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE I
FEEL LIKE I OWE AN EXPLANATION TO.
SMILEY BOWMAN IS
NOT ONE OF THEM.
ANYWAY, HE BELIEVES IN MIRACLES.
WHO AM I TO RAIN ON HIS PARADE?
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.
WHAT DO I KNOW?
♪ SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME
NOW SHE'S A MEAN OLD THING ♪
PATRICK, COULD YOU GET MY FRIEND
HERE ANOTHER ROUND OF DRINKS?
I THINK HE COULD STILL
USE A LITTLE CHEERING UP.
MY FRIEND, I'VE BEEN BACK
THERE THINKING ABOUT...
YOUR BUDDY WHO WON THE LOTTERY
TICKET AND HIS KID KIDNAPPED...
AND GOOMBATA AND ALL THAT STUFF.
ANYWAY, I REALIZED
SOMETHING. I SAID,
"IF THERE REALLY IS
LUCK, IF IT DOES EXIST,
I HOPE I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO
RECOGNIZE IT WHEN IT COMES MY WAY."
WELL, IN THAT CASE, MAY YOU GET WHAT
YOU WANT, AND MAY YOU WANT WHAT YOU GET.
BOTH TIMES. HAVE A
GOOD NIGHT, MY FRIEND.
MOTHER-IN-LAW WITH THE...
THAT WAS HIS FATHER'S FAULT.
YOU PUTTING THE OLD DOUBLE
GYPSY CURSE ON HIM, ARE YOU?
HE'S JUST SOME GUY I WAS TALKING TO BEFORE
YOU GOT HERE. HE'S GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT.
HE WAS SO DAMN SURE
OF HIMSELF, I FELT LIKE I
OWED IT TO HIM TO TELL
HIM ABOUT MICKEY WHEELER.
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
MICKEY CALLED ME THE OTHER NIGHT.
OH, YEAH? WHAT DID HE WANT? HE
WANT YOU TO TESTIFY IN HIS BIG LAW CASE?
NO, NOT ANY LONGER. HIS
MOTHER-IN-LAW'S CASE WAS DISMISSED.
GET OUT OF HERE.
I MEAN, THE WOMAN CAN LIGHT 1,000
CANDLES, SAY THE ROSARY EVERY NIGHT.
BUT IT SEEMS IN A COURT OF LAW, THERE'S NO
WAY TO PROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRAYER.
OR AS THE JUDGE PUT IT, "FAITH
IS THE ANTITHESIS OF PROOF."
HMM. HMPH.
STILL YOU GOTTA HAVE
FAITH IN SOMETHING.
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS MARRIED
WHEN I WAS WORKING NIGHT AND DAY,
AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO GET SOME EXTRA TRAINING.
SO I TOOK A MANAGEMENT
COURSE IN ANOTHER STATE.
AND MY WIFE AND I WERE HAVING PROBLEMS
ANYWAY, SO I DIDN'T NEED MUCH OF A PUSH.
THE DAY I LEFT, I WAS
DOWN IN THE STREET.
I HAPPENED TO LOOK UP
AND SEE HER IN THE WINDOW.
AND BY THE TIME I RETURNED EIGHT WEEKS
LATER, SHE'D ALREADY FILED FOR DIVORCE.
I CAN STILL SEE HER IN THE WINDOW, JUST
STANDING THERE, HOPING FOR A SIGN FROM ME.
SOMETHING. JUST A
SMALL GESTURE. AND I...
ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED IF I JUST... WAVED BACK.
MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.
MAYBE WE'D STILL BE TOGETHER.
MAYBE MY SON
WOULDN'T BE A STRANGER.
I WISH, UH...
I WISH WE COULD SEE INTO
THE FUTURE SOMETIMES.
BUT THAT'S THE
PROBLEM, ISN'T IT?
I MEAN, LIFE, IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT BACKWARDS.
TOO BAD WE GOT
TO LIVE IT FORWARDS.
HEY!
HEY, MAN.
