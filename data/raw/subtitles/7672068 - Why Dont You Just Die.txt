"He did not live to know
who the winner was." - Flann O'Brien
One, two, three,
Evil won't touch me!
What do you want?
What is it?
I'm Matvei, Olya's boyfriend.
- What?
- I'm Olya's boyfriend!
So what?
She wanted us to meet.
She must have forgotten to tell you.
Shut up already!
Olya's not home.
Maybe she's running late?
Hello.
It's Matvei, Olya's boyfriend.
Very nice to meet you.
I'm Natasha, Olya's mom.
- And where's Olya?
- Running late.
Oh, you should have warned me,
I told her I'd be in the country.
Silly girl.
Good thing I haven't left yet.
Don't just stand there, do come in...
Tea or coffee?
C-coffee.
You should've chosen tea.
Coffee takes forever.
And sit down already.
You always carry that with you?
A friend asked me for it.
How long
have you known Olya, Matvei?
Has she mentioned
that I'm in the police?
I'm a detective.
It might just be
because of the work I do,
but I pay close attention to
my daughter's friends.
Although...
I imagine all fathers do that.
Tell me about your friend.
Are you the same age?
I'm guessing 25?
He's 25 and
still has no hammer of his own.
Well, he's...
he's a computer guy.
A computer guy?
Matvei, keep up with the times.
Look around you.
Everyone's a computer guy now.
I mean, one way or another.
So what do you do?
Judging by your hands
and that hammer,
you're not a computer guy.
Whatever a man does, what matters
is that he's serious about it, right?
Do you like her a lot?
I do.
You enjoy screwing her?
What?
I asked you
if you enjoy screwing my daughter.
What... what's all this?
Relax, Matvei.
I was joking.
And... what's that hammer for?
It's a friend's.
Natasha, go to the bedroom.
- I'd better go.
- Sit.
I said, sit down!
Andrei, what's going on?
Go to the bedroom and stay there.
Sugar...
you need sugar for your coffee.
Stay there.
I'll go get it.
Freeze!
Turn around!
Who are you?
Why are you here?
I said, why are you here?
- Andrei?
- Get lost!
No, no, no...
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE!
MATVEI
What are you doing?
Oh, stop it.
I want you to kill a man for me.
Well, can you?
Don't be silly.
I want you to kill my father.
Why?
He raped me.
Your father?
If you can believe it.
Some like screwing
their own daughters.
When?
I was twelve.
What does it matter when?
Every day...
over the past 15 years...
while he's just enjoyed life...
eating, sleeping, screwing my mother,
or whoever else...
I haven't stopped thinking about it.
Feeling him...
in each and every touch and stare.
He keeps growing inside me...
like a cancerous tumor,
poisoning everything.
I can't go on like this.
He must disappear.
You'll help me, right?
Natasha, how dumb are you?
Burn it all.
Fuck!
Basically, it's pretty simple.
There's this little fucking thingy,
this catch...
catchy bastard.
If we try to open it - no fucking luck!
But keep your panties on -
we can...
take a fork to it,
but that's a pain in the ass,
because it's fucking impossible to bend.
That's why we resort to
a more common method -
a regular bobby pin.
Bend it, stick it in, and try
to turn that catchy bastard aside.
Just like that, and...
there!
We've achieved our goal,
long-awaited fucking freedom!
But it's not that simple.
The thing is, we got
some news from over-fucking-seas.
This is an import.
Those fucks invented
a thing called a "double lock".
There's one more hole in here -
and now look what happens.
It stops the catch.
That's it!
You've welded it the fuck shut.
With that thing,
the catchy bastard
is as good as gone.
So with handcuffs
of this bitch of a design,
we're fucked, bro.
Our dreams of freedom are gone.
AN IMPORT
- Dumbass.
- Asshole.
Matvei...
is that your real name?
Who are you,
and why are you here?
How do you know
I have a daughter?
Somebody send you?
Who?
Tell me who sent you!
Talk!
I said, talk!
Look, you...
you're leaving me no choice.
Come closer...
I'll tell you.
So, Matvei,
let's try this one more time.
Think it through.
You have...
the chance
to end this here and now.
I promise I'll uncuff you
and let you go in one piece.
I don't know you,
never seen you before,
I'll never see you again, but...
you've gotta tell me everything, OK?
And so,
why the fuck
did you break into my apartment?
Never...
lay hands on children.
What?
Never lay hands on children.
What children?
What is this crap?
What the hell?
Are you playing with me now?
OK, then we'll play.
Get the hell away from here!
- Given it some thought?
- No way...
Whoa now, hold on, wait.
OK, OK...
You gonna fucking tell me
why you came here?
Did...
did you kill him?
Thank God.
He said that I touched Olya
when she was a kid.
Like, he came to avenge her.
But you didn't... or did...?
No. Hell, no!
Are you completely nuts?
I don't get it.
I thought...
it was about business.
Like, we were too tough on someone...
Lots of them would, if they could.
But this is nonsense.
Have you... talked to Olya?
To tell her what?
Let him go.
Don't dirty your hands,
before it's too late.
Are you kidding?
Why would I let him go?
The guy's a thug!
Call your guys.
Have them put him in prison.
I made a sieve of his leg.
How will I explain that?
And that money...
Oh, fuck!
Fine, I'll call Evgenich.
He'll help me out.
Don't do anything stupid.
Move that idiot.
I never touched her.
I never touched my daughter.
I was about to let you go.
Natasha can tell you.
We should meet, with Olya,
and discuss this,
sort out this misunderstanding.
Look, I'm sorry, right?
Sorry about the leg, OK?
Look, I got nervous,
being a detective,
I have lots of enemies.
You wouldn't talk.
I'll pay for any kind of treatment.
You've seen, I have money.
Money...
I'll give you extra, too.
For the inconvenience, so to speak.
You're...
well, apparently, you're family.
What about justice?
It's justice I want, too!
It didn't happen,
none of it, believe me!
Call her.
Natasha, bring me the phone.
I said go get it.
Put it on speaker.
- Hello.
- Hi, Olya, hi!
Dad?
Hey, Olya.
Listen, your friend is here...
anyway, the situation is
less than pleasant.
Could you clarify something for us?
What friend?
Matvei.
I don't know anyone called Matvei.
What do you mean?
A tall guy with a crew cut.
I don' know anyone like that.
Is everything OK over there?
I'll call you back.
So much for justice.
- No, don't...
- Go away.
- Please don't!
- I said go away!
Shut the hell up already!
Evgenich.
EVGENICH
Honey, I...
I can't talk right now.
It's not a good time.
Can I call you back?
What now?
Of course I love you.
I love you very much...
You make my life worth living.
Without you, I'm nothing and no one.
Don't even say that, OK?
Don't.
We'll find the money.
I'll find it.
Sorry, honey, I can't talk any longer.
Alright, bye.
I love you very much.
Kisses.
Couldn't you hold it in?
She's beautiful.
Not my type.
Looks a bit like my Olya.
Is there more light?
I have a headache.
I couldn't f-find any.
Some cop you are.
Anyway...
we've got a box cutter,
likely used for cutting her up.
Are you kidding?
A bag of white powder,
looks a lot like coke.
And some pills.
All you need for a party.
The rope and the gag
are covered in blood.
A pile of 1,000 ruble bills.
90,000 by the way.
And keys to an Infiniti.
Gilded fucking youth.
Take him away now.
We'll wait for a detective
and forensics.
Give me the camera.
I want a few more photos.
I've already
ph-photographed everything.
I said give it here.
I'll give it back, damn it!
This is my chance.
What do you mean?
I need money.
Badly.
As you know, the surgery
costs a fortune.
What are you saying?
He's a rich kid.
We talk to his parents,
and get him off, for a fee.
Look around.
How will you get him off?
Don't know.
I'll think of something.
He cut a girl up with a box cutter.
There's nothing to think of.
OK, he was framed: there was
a third person who drugged his wine.
And when these two passed out,
he cut up the girl.
Sounds like nonsense.
Come on!
It'll work.
We'll hand out cash,
grease the right palms.
- Not the first time.
- Well, no.
But that was easy,
compared to this bloody carnage.
I'm not doing this for me.
It's for Klava.
We saw right away
that he's a good kid.
He just lost his way.
So we'd like to help.
As you can see, it's a difficult case,
so we can't make any guarantees.
You drop off the money
in a locker at the station.
If it works out,
and he's released, we'll collect it.
But bear in mind that...
if the locker's empty
when he goes free,
both you and your son
will face serious problems.
Let's get going.
I wanted to thank you.
What for?
Thanks for doing this,
for helping me.
This...
This money is...
our last...
last hope.
Her health's gotten a lot worse.
OK, enough.
Pull yourself together.
Knock it off.
You'd do the same for me.
Last night, she...
she didn't recognize me.
She had no idea, you know?
I was standing in front of her,
like this, and she...
she...
Stay here and pull yourself together,
I'll get the cash.
And where's...
The locker is empty.
What?
The locker was empty.
Those worthless rats!
Those scumbags!
Scum!
Assholes!
Scum!
Stop that crying!
This is bad enough as it is.
Andrei...
the thing you did with the leg...
makes you look pathological.
Natasha, could you
make us some tea?
Tea?
Yeah, but without sugar.
OK, no sugar.
So...
who is he?
Do you know?
I don't even know what's worse.
If she doesn't
actually know who he is...
or...
So if he's not a friend of hers,
then who is he?
And you...
you really never touched her?
Are you totally mad?
She's my daughter!
I never touched her!
Have all of you gone nuts?!
Alright, quiet.
I'm trying to understand.
If everything he said is true,
and he really does know Olya...
and looking at his leg,
I doubt that he would be lying...
then...
why would she tell him...
that you... you know...
if it never actually happened?
Well, it didn't!
It didn't!
I believe you.
But take a look.
What is this about, then?
I have no idea.
Maybe she just...
knew that he's the kind of thug
who would agree to kill you.
Why would she do that?
You tell me -
she's your daughter.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Andrei, let's take him
to the bathroom for now.
Natasha, go lie down
and get some rest.
We'll manage this
between the two of us, OK?
- Go.
- OK.
Give me a hand.
Let's call her over.
What?
Let's call Olya over,
to see him...
and watch her reaction.
So, you want to show your daughter
a body you destroyed...
which, most likely,
belongs to her boyfriend?
I have to know.
Because if it's really her
who's behind this...
She'll be here soon.
Let's get him out of here already.
THE 2000s
He's back.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
How many fingers?
- Your turn.
- You haven't the balls.
We'll see about that.
Look, he's laughing!
High five!
HEART STOPPED FOR:
12 MINUTES
HEART STOPPED FOR:
17 MINUTES
Whoa, wait!
He's breathing.
WORLD'S BEST DAD
Did you see anything?
Is there something...
after death?
Yes, there's something.
There is something.
Can't remember what.
Andrei, there is something.
Something, my ass.
And don't listen to him.
He's fucked in the head!
Why give him water? He's finished!
Andrei, we agreed to wait for Olya,
so cool it, OK?
You'd talk differently
if he'd swung a hammer at you.
OK, drink up.
What the hell is this?
Cut it out!
- I called you to help me, not him!
- I'm trying to help everyone!
You gotta get a grip!
Had you called the cops
instead of going all gestapo here,
there'd be no problem.
- He couldn't call the cops.
- What?
What's that bullshit?
Shut up.
What do you mean?
- I saw the money.
- Shut your fucking mouth,
- or I'll fucking bury you!
- Andrei!
- Why are you listening to this fuck?
- Be quiet, Andrei!
Quiet.
What money?
In the cupboard.
Where's this money from?
Where's this money from?
You know perfectly well.
You know perfectly well
where it's from.
Andrei... how?
We could have...
could have done it.
Klava, my wife, could still be alive.
She'd have died even if
you'd spent 10 times as much.
Andrei, don't.
She gave up long ago,
and you know it,
sucking the life out of others.
Look at yourself, you turned into
God-knows-what thanks to her.
I was ready
to strangle her myself...
so you'd stop complaining.
I set you free.
Look.
Look at the money.
Half of it is yours, just yours.
No more drips,
pills, and operations.
No more complaining and misery.
There's only the finest food,
and gorgeous whores.
And it's all for you, Evgenich.
You shouldn't have done that, Andrei.
Come on, wake up!
You'll thank me some day.
My wife died because of you.
No, she died of cancer.
Lower your fucking gun.
Olya, dear!
Forgive me.
Mom.
And so I've lived to see my death.
I saw my wife in a dream last night.
First time since the funeral.
Evgenich!
Beautiful Klava...
beautiful...
she was in a white dress,
like at our wedding, remember?
I started crying,
and Klava...
just held me to her...
tightly to her chest.
And I felt completely calm.
Be quiet,
you shouldn't be talking now.
OLYA
They bore him barefaced on the bier,
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny,
And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
Fare you well, my dove!
No, no, he is dead,
Go to thy death-bed.
He never will come again.
I'm dying.
Oleg was looking for you.
- Don't bother explaining.
- But I'm ready.
You're an hour late.
The play started late.
I'll get here earlier tomorrow.
You don't work here anymore.
Why?
Because you're fired.
Take it off, and leave.
Because I'm late once?
First of all,
it's not the first time,
and you know it.
Secondly...
you have problems with team work.
Oleg, please.
I can't afford to lose this job now.
With my theater work,
I won't find another job.
It hardly pays,
I can't live on it.
As it is, I only sleep 4 hours a day.
You're part of the team...
and we've never had problems.
Right?
I... I'll do better.
I'll make up the hours.
Please, Oleg dear, help me.
Please.
Can you give me a handjob?
You know, jerk me off.
No, I mean...
Oksana used to do it.
Then she started dating
the bartender...
and I kind of didn't feel right
asking her any more.
And you need my help.
Like, an exchange of services.
Maybe, I'll even...
give you a bonus...
next pay day.
What's up?
Where's Mom?
I don't know.
She's at the country house
most of the time.
Are you listening?
What do you want from me?
Your help.
Why would I?
Maybe because you're my father.
You're almost 30.
I don't need much,
just to keep afloat.
Find yourself a good job.
I already have a good job.
Yeah, except it doesn't pay.
I'm going for a shower.
Lock up behind you.
- You know him?
- Let her go, I beg you!
For the last time:
do you know him?
- She's your daughter!
- Shut up!
Or I'll blow her head off.
Yes, I know him.
I know him!
Is this about money?
You saw the money
and sent him over?
Is this about money?!
Yes.
She'd kill her own father
for a stack of paper.
Look, Mom...
what a fine daughter we've raised.
How do you live with yourself?
What are you looking at?
Yes, I needed money.
No, he didn't rape me.
That doesn't change a thing.
He still ruined my entire life!
Bullshit, you little bitch!
I've hardly ever seen you sober.
You knocked us around.
I've dreamt of
killing you since I was five.
Finally together as a family.
My dears, my lovelies...
Andrei, dear, please offer
our guests some tea,
while I... go change.
I'm a little...
I'm just...
I think we had
some cookies somewhere.
Do you know where they are?
Mom...
Because of you...
I killed...
my friend.
My only friend.
We've been friends since childhood.
You're my daughter, after all.
About him,
we'll have to... you know...
Yes, of course.
Go keep your mom company.
I have to clean up here.
Olya...
Try this again,
or anyone hears about the cash,
I'll forget I have a daughter.
OK, Dad.
Oh, no, Mom, no!
Fuck!
- Don't even move!
- Dad!
Where are you going?
Dad!
Hurry!
Mom...
Mom.
Mom.
She's not breathing.
She's not breathing.
She left a note.
Oh, no it's...
just a piece of paper.
Help...!
Olya, see who that is.
Olya.
Olya, for fuck's sake!
Olya.
Don't make a sound.
Easy-easy.
Easy, it'll all be over soon.
Hello.
Hello there.
You took a while opening up.
Really?
I... didn't hear you.
No wonder - the neighbors
have complained about constant noise.
Oh...
I'm so sorry.
I probably had
the TV on too loud.
Are you OK?
- Miss?
- Yes.
Are you home alone?
Yes.
Just, the windows are open.
So there's a draft.
Is this your apartment?
No.
It's my parents'.
They're in the country.
Can we see your identification?
- Hey, what's that?
- Wait.
I thought you looked familiar.
Olya Likhovskaya?
You wouldn't happen to be
Andrei's daughter?
I am.
Why didn't you say so?
He's a legend at our station.
I guess I was shy.
My period started all of a sudden.
So it's bad timing.
Sorry to have bothered you.
No, I'm sorry.
Oh, and the call
came from apartment 8.
Really?
Those bastards.
Say hi to your father.
Give him our love.
I will.
Bye.
Where does he get the strength?
What are you going to do?
This is what I think.
Natasha was seeing Evgenich
behind my back.
I was at the country house,
so she invited him here.
He came over, but not alone,
with this guy.
They got drunk and got into
an argument, which grew into a fight.
Evgenich stabbed him with a knife
and destroyed his leg.
And this fuck
got him with the shotgun,
crawled to the couch, and died.
And Mom?
Hit by accident in the fight.
We'll put her there,
like she hit her head on that.
Not very believable.
Especially since those cops saw me.
That's a formality,
there won't be an investigation.
Why?
I didn't spend my life
in the police for nothing.
Right, now it's definitely time to die.
Got any cigarettes?
Let's go.
Do you not care at all
that Mom died?
It hasn't hit me yet.
Your friend's death
hit you right away.
Asshole.
What do you want from me?
You started this mess.
Because you're so damn greedy.
However hard you tried
to screw up my childhood,
back then I at least knew
black from white.
I knew right from wrong.
When I did something shitty...
I knew it right away.
And I was ashamed.
And then...
time passes...
and you make one compromise,
and then another.
And suddenly,
doing shitty things isn't so bad.
It's just a way of life.
And it's surprising...
how everything evil can be justified.
It becomes acceptable.
People adapt.
But you're ahead of them all.
As a kid, you were...
pretty dumb.
I'm amazed
you didn't get smarter with age.
Are you still alive?
I didn't want it
to turn out like this.
I'm dying.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
That's OK.
Evil won't touch me.
