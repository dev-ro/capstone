Speak to the forlorn poor
with the mouth of a ruminating calf
Chew into their hearts: they need
not be heroes if they can't be
Attila József
For instance, József Pelikán, dike-
keeper, never wanted to be a hero
Hungary, 1949
LONG LIVE OUR GREAT,
WISE LEADER!
Not there!
Józsi, there's meat at the shop!
That's all until next week
There's nothing for it
but to kill Desirée
Must we?
Coat those ration cards
in breadcrumbs
Poor Desirée
She has to die tonight
And Desirée died
I think we can start now
Practice like hell, for God's sake
Comrades, strike your picks in deep
The brawny Workers' Brigade
strides forth
The sound resounds proudly
from our lips
Our new song of joy
- Where's your father?
- At a seminar
- At this hour?
- He's at work all day
- What are they doing?
- It's a patrol meeting
The eight members of the
Pelikán patrol! Choir practice
Have you got a pig, lad?
We haven't even the swill to feed it
I'll be back
Go and fetch the garlic
I'll do the rest, Gizi
Don't eat the fat, or you'll be sick
Listen, what was that?
Wasn't it the dog?
All right, then
A poacher on the horizon
Hallo, Comrade Dániel
Why so surprised?
I've come to do a bit of fishing
I've not been here for ten years
So I noticed
How's life? How's the wife?
She ran off with bargee, a Romanian
Oh, well. How about the children?
Fine. Aren't you married yet,
Comrade Dániel?
Why so formal with me, Józsi?
- How should I speak to a minister?
- Let's not stand on ceremony
I'll get angry if we,
of all people, stick to formalities
- What's the mood like around here?
- Well...
I read that it's excellent
- Where did you read that?
- In the Mood Report
Then it'll be excellent
Hold on! Gophers are the dike's
most dangerous enemies
Wait a moment
- Is that their hole?
- Pour it down, Zoltán
The kids will be pleased;
they get two forints tail at a depot
Hold it up for a moment
- Where are you going?
- I've got a bite
What a fool I am;
it must have been a fantastic catfish
Promise not to tell anyone...
...I lost the world's biggest catfish
You heard nothing, saw nothing
But I've got
a Council of Minister meeting
Now you shut up and lie down
Lie down and we'll make tea for you
- Put some life into him, Gizi
- I'll try
What do you mean, "shush"?
Where's that pig, or I'll get rough
Not so loud, comrades, or you'll
wake the comrade minister
"Comrade Minister"! Talk like that
will land you in jail
Isn't illegal slaughtering enough,
without abusing leading comrades?
- Do as you like
- It's a house search
- What's going on, comrades?
- Who are you, comrade?
Have you never seen me before?
Report, if you please
Comrade Minister, it's a house search
József Pelikán has been reported
for illegal pig-slaughtering
Proceed with your search, comrades;
reports are sacred
Put everything back in place
And take note of one thing
We have enough enemies. It's not
honest workers we should harry
Why should you upset József Pelikán's
peaceful home?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
But he was reported
What do you mean, reported?
What if someone reported you for
drug smuggling or bank robbery?
Nine out of ten reports are crazy
I don't understand. It was a serious
anonymous report; typewritten
Listen here... comrade
Do you know the sacrifice
József Pelikán made for us?
Skip it, Zoltán
No, Józsi, the comrades should know
who they're pestering
Now listen
In 1944, in this very room...
...he was beaten and kicked
by detectives. Why?
To make him give us away
A word from him would betray us;
we were down here in the cellar
Zoltán, don't
We heard him being tortured,
but he kept quiet
He kept us five weeks underground
You ought to take your caps off to him
He hid us here, in this very place
Comrades...
...perform your duty
The law applies to everyone; a
hundred times more so for communists
I see
Meanwhile,
we'll drench this with petrol
This is material proof, to be
appended to the criminal evidence
How else can we preserve it for
the trial?
- What's happening, dad?
- Be good, children
Let's go
Don't bear it against me, Jóska;
I couldn't help it
No whoring around, mind
I'll send back your suit
I don't think I'll need it urgently
It's Mr. Pelikán!
An aquaintance at last
These are false, Mr. Gulyás
Nicely done.
Did I knock out the originals?
The kids swept them off the floor.
Now I'll get my own back
Open your mouth, you torturer
Mr. Pelikán, I'm paying the penalty.
Must I lose my teeth, too?
- What did you get?
- Eight years
We'll wait for them.
But when they're up...
That wouldn't be the right thing.
It was my trade, after all
I never bore any personal grudge
Wouldn't I be useful to this regime?
Has it such experienced people?
They managed to detect me all right
Jailed within 24 hours of illegal
pig-slaughtering. Express work, eh?
Was there punch-up?
Do you mind? We can get on
quite well without you, thanks
Did you confess, Father?
Kiss his hand; you never know
Why are you here, my son?
He's not a political, Your Grace. A
common criminal: illegal slaughtering
Everything is politics, my son.
I shall pray for you
On the third day, Pelikán
was allowed visitors
- How are things?
- Everyone's fine
- And the dike?
- No problems
- The water level?
- It rose two centimeters yesterday
You're not home evenings, I suppose
Yes, I am
Mind the little ones don't see
your goings on
Don't worry, they don't
You saw the lawyer?
Imagine, dad, Dániel sent his driver
to see how we were
He returned the suit and said
he'd visit us one day
Very decent, but
what about the lawyer?
He said he'll do all he can
What will I get?
It depends what you get it for
You may be fined, or you
might get the severest sentence...
... if they want to set an example
What severest sentence? Death?
Your punishment will
depend on the example
Charming! What else did he say?
Don't be surprised if he asks for
severe punishment, at the trial
Who? The defence lawyer?
It would be different if you
were a rich kulak...
...but as you're a party member
and the lawyer isn't... socialist law...
What's that about socialist law?
Think
Well, setting an example is
the main thing. And not to worry
All right. Give them my love,
take care of yourselves
Guard the dike and watch out
for moles and gophers
Socialism still on the move, Pelikán?
Have I got to bash your head
in after all, Gulyás?
We Hungarians should love each
other. You've got high-up friends
Put in a word for me; it's a pity
to let me waste here
Sod off, Gulyás
I'm serious. I could name
one or two people out to get you lot
Isn't one of them called Csetneki?
I'm saying nothing, but if you'd
put in a good word for me...
I wonder what's for supper?
Noodles again
If only they'd pour some
oniony gravy over them
The food was far better in our day
Shut up. I had my fill of your food
József Pelikán, bring your things
Condemned cell?
Comrade Pelikán, you are free
- Free?
- As a bird. Congratulations
And the pig, Desirée?
There never was a pig. You are
innocent; all charges are dropped
But I did kill that pig,
so I'm rightfully here
No arguments. You're innocent
and that's that; orders from above
Anyway, improve the food.
Reactionaries mustn't
criticize democratic prisons
It's not that good outside, either,
but one's more politically aware here
No bones broken?
You've lost weight. Who was the
scum who informed on you?
I'd have got ten years, but if
someone's pally with a minister...
You reported me, Csetneki
You reported me, Csetneki
Because it's as clear as a punch-up
you reported me in 1942
What if I discovered
a thing or two about you?
- Such as what? - You sent
the village lads to Germany
That's no secret
And you wore such a lovely
Fascist armband
I was only a small-time Fascist;
they were exonerated
Were they? No one asked my opinion.
Now get out of here
You've no right to do that
Right? Get out before I chuck you
out, though I'm a peaceful man
Be off with you
Very well, Pelikán
But you're in for a big surprise
- József Pelikán?
- Yes. This is my daughter
- What's in that parcel?
- A duck
Pelikán is here
Please take a seat
- Is Zoli Dániel in?
- Wait a moment, please
You can go in now
Come back. What are you doing?
What are you waiting for?
- We're looking for Comrade Dániel
- Is he out?
- I don't know
- When will he be in?
- I don't know
- Is he abroad?
- I don't know
Could you say if
he's still minister here?
I don't know
Are you József Pelikán
from Szigetnádasd...
...1 Trebich Nándor Street?
That's right. I wanted to thank
Comrade Dániel for his kindness
Leave the parcel here
Can we go?
I hope you've a fridge here
You can go
You could put it in...
Pelikán doesn't understand a thing
One night a big, black car
comes for him
Where are we going?
Are you going to hang me?
Go on, tell me. We all
have to die some time
Even you, lads
Were your mothers dumb, too?
I'm to go up? God be with you, lads
No gossiping about this, mind
Welcome, Comrade Pelikán
Aren't you hungry?
We could have dinner together
I've had supper, but I could
eat a little something
You may serve dinner,
Comrade Goglák
Those Christmases of childhood,
eh, Comrade Pelikán?
- What will you drink?
- Me? More or less anything
You leave the choice to me
You look well, Comrade Pelikán
The Danube air.
You look well, too, comrade
Oh, this office work withers on away
- Good appetite
- Thank you very much
- Is this all mine?
- Go ahead; tuck in
Sucking-pig isn't bad, eh,
Comrade Pelikán?
- Comrade Virág,
I confess everything - Easy now
I slaughtered the pig
We can wipe that out. Say nothing;
we know everything, anyway
That's all right, then
Your jacket was made in 1938.
English material, 85 per cent. Wool
They don't make such
material nowadays
Shoulders a little over-padded,
but good lapels
Do eat some more
Won't you eat anything?
My stomach... but you go ahead
It's good to encounter
an old campaigner
It's a pity we didn't meet earlier
You see, Comrade Pelikán, one day
we're going to ask something of you
- What will you ask?
- All in good time
We'll be meeting again
Suppose I dropped in on you
with my family one day
- On me?
- To make friends
To get to know each other; we're
two good, old comrades after all
The problem is,
I can't produce such a supper
No need to guzzle all the time
All I can say is, Comrade Pelikán,
the international situation...
...is intensifying
Intensifying? It's good to know
One must never forget that
I won't
One day, Pelikán took
the children out for ice-cream
Watch it, lads
My sons
Passionate photographers, and
your old campaigner's family...
...is a perfect subject
I'd gladly invite you to supper,
but we've nothing but potatoes
We could do baked potatoes,
couldn't we?
Excellent. But let's
walk with the children first
Well, if that's what you fancy
How ingenious our people are
I envy you, Comrade Pelikán
The potato
The word reminds me of something
Doesn't the word potato ring a bell,
Comrade Pelikán?
No, Comrade Virág
Take a good look at me.
Doesn't it stir memories?
I've got it! 1945;
you shared out potatoes
You didn't have a moustache then.
You made a fine speech
As you stood in front of the
railway wagon a door opened...
...and the potatoes poured
on top of you
We struggled to pull you out;
you could hardly breathe
We were grateful to you. In those
days there was no grub here at all
Well, don't let's sentimentalise.
We can wipe that out
Isn't that the spare room?
You last had a guest
three weeks ago
Zoli Dániel
He was in bed after
jumping into the river
Fell in, more like.
He was shivering like a jelly
How did you know?
No matter. But just remember this,
Comrade Pelikán:
Sucking-pig or potatoes, the
class struggle is intensifying
No more ammunition, Colonel
Permission to use hand-grenades?
I'd rather you didn't.
Just hold on a moment
Bursting paper bugs again,
weren't you?
They're allowed to make bangs!
He's got a mania for paper bags
Don't cry, lad. You'll live
to see a jollier, happier world
Sorry, Comrade Virág
Not at all. We spring to the defence,
come what may
I want to say that it's
inconceivable, criminal...
...that an old campaigner should
mess about guarding dikes
I'm quite happy where I am
Your place is in a responsible, leading
position. What are you good at?
Dike-keeping, gopher catching.
I'm ideologically ill-qualified
Do you love our great, wise leader?
Of course
Well, then
So Pelikán became the
swimming-pool director
- Why are they waiting?
- Who are you?
The new director.
Have they got tickets?
They have
- Why not let them in?
- I can't because...
I can't understand; speak louder
Have they got tickets?
Stop whispering. I've been
sent here to create order
Don't gawp at me,
just give me your ticket
Let the others in, please
The pool is for workers to swim in
Don't be funny, I asked to see
your ticket, not your gun
You there, have you got a ticket?
Are you deaf?
Treason!
- Back again? - The regime
can thrive without me, too
Not for long
- Why?
- The Americans are coming
Truman on a white horse?
Don't you know anything new?
Yes, your pals are jailing each other
- What did you say?
- It's even in the papers
- God brought you, my son
- In a black car, Father
Any news about how long
this is all going to last?
I don't want to alarm you, but
it'll last quite a while yet
And the God of the
Hungarians allows it
So it seems. What's for lunch?
Noodles
We mustn't eat the seed-corn of the
future, though I wouldn't mind a bite
Bring your things
I'm terribly sorry about
that affair, Comrade Virág...
...but I did warn you that
I'm ideologically ill-qualified
If Comrade Bastion had been
swimming in his general's uniform...
...then I'd have
recognized him for sure...
...and I'd have protected him
from the splashing throng
But in those trunks he looked...
perhaps it was the light
He has already forgiven you
We've arrested a ticket-collector;
he was responsible
It wasn't his fault;
I didn't know the party line
The collector's mother was the
mistress of a mill-owing kulak
He's confessed
As a matter of fact,
I'd like to go back to the dike
Not a chance, Comrade Pelikán
One day...
...we'll ask something of you
Not now?
In good time
The tension's killing
Just a moment, Comrade Goglák
Isn't that a new skirt?
It is, Comrade Virág
It's short; sexuality is an opiate
of the decadent west
We have no need of it.
Am I not right, Comrade Pelikán?
You're right, it is, Comrade Virág
Hard, very hard
You will have to guard a vulnerable
outpost of cultural progress
A political and
ideological reorientation
Must it be me?
When we are absent,
the enemy is present
You are now director of
the English Park
Why "English Park"?
That's what it's called
Why English? Why not
Gaiety Park, or Fun Park?
Exactly
You grasped the problem
by the throat, comrade
English Park?
So the English imperialists can
snigger at us? Not bloody likely!
Gaiety Park; that's what
the workers want
So Pelikán got a new job.
He set to work enthusiastically
GAIETY PARK
LONG LIVE OUR WISE LEADER!
From today, the ghost train...
...will be known as
The Socialist Ghost Train
We'll get rid of the
skeletons and old junk...
...and replace them
with portraits of our leaders,
especially Comrade Bastion
What about the shrieks
and rattling bones?
They can stay
Won't people be scared by
Comrade Bastion?
So what? Comrade Virág said
the class struggle is intensifying
Anyone with a skeleton
in the cupboard
will wet his pants
on the ghost train
Don't you agree, comrades?
THE SOCIALIST GHOST TRAIN
DOWN WITH BOURGEOUIS
PSEUDO-CULTURE!
THE FORGER OF OUR VICTORY
A SPECTRE IS HAUNTING EUROPE
WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE
BUT OUR CHAINS
THE FORGER OF OUR VICTORY
Here's some water,
beloved Comrade Bastion
Imbecile!
Tell me if I've gone wrong,
beloved Comrade Bastion
I know I've a lot to learn
Look at you, man! Attention!
Father, I don't know, nothing
goes right for me nowadays
With the best of intentions,
I misunderstand the party line
And the water level keeps rising
Don't fret, my son. Have a cigar
Are you making offers, too, Father?
Come on, I got it from them
And you dared to
run down our prisons
"Our prisons"!
Keep quiet, foolish man
"Our prisons" when they're
always locking you up
One can learn from that, too
Even if it's only by disputing with
highly respected clerical reaction
A dike-keeper having the opportunity
to talk politics with a bishop
It's a question of backbone
- You'll soon be filleted
- I think you're wrong there
Excuse me
I may be an idiot, but there's
no going back on things
The bishop's angry because he's
lost his land and his schools
Aren't I right?
Can't you shut up?
It's a stroke of luck you're
locked up in here.
You'd have a fit if you saw
how our country is being rebuilt
I'm not interested
The bishop would hate to see
peasant deserting church for factory
Are you agitating here in prison?
Aren't I right, Father?
Let's not talk politics.
What's for supper?
Noodles and potatoes
You see, things are improving
Don't experiment with
me any more, Comrade Virág
Let me go back to the dike,
the Danube's rising
Life is not a
whipped-cream cake, Pelikán
I grow weary, too, sometimes
I, too, am human
There's many a sleepless night
nowadays, Comrade Pelikán
Drink a beer before going to bed,
you'll sleep like a log
Sleeplessness must be awful
It really won't be long before
we ask something of you, comrade
Spit it out
Patience. The right move
at the right time
Until then, a new watchpost,
Comrade Pelikán
Mercy. I'm a complete idiot
One must build up self-confidence.
Do you like...
Our wise leader
I was thinking of oranges.
Do you like them?
What sort?
Oranges in general. A citrus fruit
I'm sure I like them; I've not
had one for twenty years
ORANGE RESEARCH INSTITUTE
At last we can begin
experiments in Hungary
We could put others in that corner;
there's a warm breeze
The crop was not big,
but the only ripe orange...
was diligently guarded until
the opening ceremony
Forward with the Hungarian orange!
Show me your hands, Pisti
You didn't eat that orange, did you?
I thought it was here to eat
Well, it wasn't
You've ruined me, you rascal!
What shall I do now, damn it?
Comrade Virág, my son's eaten
the orange. What shall we do?
Take it easy. Here you are
- That's a lemon
- An orange
I rule that beyond discussion
What's this?
An orange
The new Hungarian orange
Slightly yellower,
slightly sharper, but our own
Gala performance in Honour of
the Orange Researchers
Heroes of the Battle of the Orange
We've won. It was worth it, wasn't it?
You see, Pelikán, it's
good to be sitting on our laurels
I feel a little bad about it, though
Why do we make such a fuss over it?
We deceived the people, after all
Who did we deceive? Ourselves?
We know what it's all about
The researchers?
They're happy to have medals
The masses?
They don't eat oranges or lemons,
but they're happy to celebrate
The imperialists? We've
given them a thorough beating
I wouldn't like to be in their shoes
We proclaimed a slogan: Let there be
a Hungarian orange! And there was
We made no empty promise, Pelikán
That night the big, black car
came for Pelikán again
You're not exatly a chatterbox
How are things, Comrade Pelikán?
Should I know?
Do sit down
One eye weeps, the other twinkles.
You know what I'm thinking about?
I've no idea what you're
thinking about
The international
situation is intensifying
We've caught up with the
latest group of inner-parasites
- Another new group?
- Dániel and his group
- Dániel who?
- Zoltán Dániel, the ex-minister
You know him, too
Of course I do. Zoli Dániel
and his gang, that's a good one!
What's funny, you fool?
The whole thing. You comrades
even spare time for such a joke
This is no joke
Zoltán Dániel is a soy, a traitor,
a Fascist police informer
It's a scandal that he evaded
our vigilance for so long
I may be an idiot, but
I don't believe it. I know Dániel
You know him! What
difference does that make?
You don't really know your own self
And if I tell you he's
confessed everything?
Confessed everything...
What do you mean: everything?
Now just get prepared for it
You'll be the star witness
for what, for heaven's sake?
Begin from the fact that
Dániel is a spy, traitor, informer
Now, do you still see nothing
suspicious in his behaviour?
Not even if you crucify me
Couldn't you ask
a better qualified comrade?
Not a chance
Think over what happened
when Dániel last visited you
Nothing happened
Something must have
He fished, we caught gophers,
he fell in,
I took him home to the spare room
You found nothing
suspicious in all that?
Didn't he swear you to something?
- Swear me something?
- Think, now
He made me swear to tell no one
he'd lost a fantastic catfish
There you are, then
Are you sure it was a catfish?
What else could it have been?
All sorts of things.
That's the whole point
Spies don't work in a way to arouse
suspicion; on the contrary
The suspicious thing about them
is that they're not suspicious
Got it now, Pelikán?
No. The suspicious thing about
them is that they're not suspicious?
Exactly
- I'm not suspicious, but I'm not a spy
- How do you know?
Is it possible that I'm a spy?
Everything is possible
Many things may be possible with you,
if you don't stand steadfast
I see... I mean, I don't see at all
Couldn't you leave me out of this,
Comrade Virág?
As you wish
What do you want?
Why are you harassing
Comrade Pelikán? He's our friend
Aren't you, Comrade Pelikán?
Iced cakes
For the moment, all we ask of you
is to collect your thoughts
I'll collect them, Comrade Virág
But let me go back to the dike;
it'll soon be high water
Go back, by all means;
we'll watch over you
But remember: those who don't trust
in us, don't trust in themselves
Those who don't trust in us, don't
trust in our bright future, either
And those who don't trust in our
happy, bright future... are traitors
Thank you very much
It's impossible. Incredible
What's the matter, dad?
Iced cakes
I don't get it; am I that crazy?
Zoltán Dániel confessed everything
Everything? A pity
Good God, do you know something?
Were you in it, too?
In what?
How did you get mixed up
with that poor devil?
In the spare room,
when he was last here
- But he was in bed
- I was in bed, too
Good God!
Put some life into him, you said
So I got in with him to warm him up
How could you?
Nothing happened, we only talked
He asked if I'd read a Clara Zetkin
and whether I was studying hard
- Nothing else happened?
- No; I was surprised, too
Think. Did nothing else happen?
Honest, it didn't; I'd remember
Wasn't there anything
suspicious about Dániel?
No, except that there
we were and we just talked
There. Eat it
The suspicious things are
those that aren't suspicious
Even God Almighty
doesn't understand that
The suspicious things...
are those that aren't suspicious
Pelikán pondered the matter all night
At dawn he slept, but
his cigarette burned on
My poor friend,
I heard what happened
The international situation is
intensifying. That's burnt out
I rule that beyond discussion, but
did it burn by accident, I wonder?
It was no accident
The fire brigade didn't come,
even though I gave the alarm
My poor friend, life is not
a whipped-cream cake
We give blows and we get blows
We're here, Józsi
I don't want to sow suspicion, but
didn't Csetneki bring them a bit late?
We'll look into the matter
Ask the comrade to come here
I've got a question to ask, comrade
The house is burnt,
I rule that beyond discussion...
...but weren't you tardy with the
extinguishing, Comrade Csetneki?
Confidential orders:
vigilance must come first
We get many calls; first we
have to check every one of them
We must see we're not misled.
That takes time
That's true
May I go?
A strong hand. Resolution.
Yes, that's the spirit
Comrade Virág, would it surprise you
to know that Csetneki's a Fascist?
My poor friend, your nerves are
shattered; I should keep tabs on you
But no the house is most important
It will be rebuilt,
better than it was before
The sky's the limit. Do you know
who said that, Comrade Pelikán?
I can guess
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT
SUPREME EFFORT TO REBUILD
THE DIKE-KEEPER'S HOUSE
No sand? I want sand,
scour the world for it
I rule that beyond discussion.
And I expect gravel, too
Scrumptious!
Comrade Virág! No door?
No window?
Where are we going?
Your testimony will be ready today
Quite frankly, I'm rather nervous
about it, too. I have a request
Be very discreet
If you don't like something, tell me
Comrade Tuschinger is
very sensitive, the artistic type
I've finished it
You can read it
Are you Pelikán?
Read it
I envy you
- Where have you got to?
- The frogmen
- Do you like it?
- Very much. No clichés
I rewrote it five times
- Well?
- Very good
- I've got to say all this?
- Naturally; you're the star witness
I can take criticism, so let's have
your objections, my good man
Excuse me, this isn't my line and
I'm an ideological beginner...
...but Dániel throwing tins containing
his spy reports into the Danube...
What did he throw, then?
Eeaster eggs?
Gophers. I know, because I cut off
their tails first, for the kids
Who's interested in that?
It's pure naturalism. What else?
It also seems that Comrade Dániel
jumped into the Danube...
...and talked to enemy
frogmen under water...
...about the murder of our great
leader and other comrades...
...but in fact he fell in
trying to catch a catfish
- Did you see the fish?
- No
Your criticism is baseless; I insist
on the frogmen. Eh, Comrade Virág?
I think, the frogmen are good
Maybe we could change the tins
All right, but tell me how
Perhaps I'm saying something silly...
but what about keeping the tins...
...but covering them
with gopher skins?
That might be more credible
Not bad; you've got a literery streak.
Why don't you write?
There are people
much better than me
I'll rewrite the gophers
Any more objections?
If I may say so, the secret transmitter
business in my spare room...
He was soaked to the skin,
his teeth were chattering
I put him to bed under the eiderdown
But I happen to know
something quite different
My daughter Gizi got in with him.
No question of a transmitter
That's pure pornography.
Any more objections?
None
Strength and health,
Comrade Bastion
- Is it ready?
- Yes, Comrade Bastion
What's this? People don't even
want to murder me any more?
I'm not worth a turd nowadays?
The previous trial... I didn't want
to repeat myself. But I'll correct it
"After our wise leader, Comrade
Bastion was to be murdered."
Will that do?
Yes. Otherwise I like it
So do I. It cost many a sleepless
night; we wanted to avoid stereotypes
Modesty! Don't flatter yourself
If there's anything I admire
in myself, it's modesty
Who's that fat fellow?
Pelikán, the star witness
Comrade Bastion,
I'm just a simple dike-keeper
- I've seen you before
- The swimming-pool; I was arrested
Then Gaiety Park; arrested again.
Then the orange grove; an award
But I've a bad feeling now.
I don't want to be a witness
Then why are you here?
I don't know either.
I should be on the dike
It's no good, Virág;
we must have voluntary witnesses
Understand?
Good-bye, Béla
You're leaving us?
Comrade Virág,
please don't leave me here
Comrade Virág,
I didn't mean any harm
To the cemetery
I didn't mean to get at you
Beloved Comrade Virág,
because of me?
Not just you. We sacrifice
our entire lives for you people...
...but you don't deserve us:
heartless rabble
And that's putting it mildly
I admit I'm an ignorant dimwit,
but please don't kill yourself
Just give me a little lecture,
so I can know what it's all about
It's about truth which is
being trodden underfoot
I don't want to tread on anyone,
but I saw with my own eyes
With your own eyes, is that it?
What you see with blind eyes,
hear with deaf ears?
And a dull brain; do you think you
can attain the truth of our great aims?
Not I, Comrade Virág. What bothered
me is that I know Zoltán Dániel
If I didn't know him it would be
much easier to testify to his guilt
Can there be any doubt? Show me
one person in this lousy country...
...whom I'm not able to prove guilty
in five minutes: you, me, everyone
You may be right,
but please put that gun away
We shouldn't joke, we should act.
Look here, I could shoot you
That's true
- Knock out your teeth
- You're a bit late for that
I could sit you on a hot stove, shove
electricity through your testicles
Or simply starve you
But have I ever harmed you, Pelikán?
I always thought you were
the sort of comrade...
...who did what was entrusted to him
of his own free will; happily, even
I'm disappointed in you
What's more, Comrade Bastion
is disappointed in me
In me, Árpád Virág
Do you know what that means?
I'm ready for anything,
Comrade Virág
Thank you... you have
restored my faith
Comrade Bastion, please
I see. I'll go there
I'll report to Comrade Bastion
Comrade Bastion was participating
in the customary autumn shoots
- Where's Comrade Bastion?
- At the second butt
- I've never fired a shot
- You'll soon learn
- Poor bunnies
- Moralizing again
- Shouldn't we shoot back?
- Have you gone mad?
Can't you see what they're doing?
I thought we ought to signal
that we're not rabbits
Don't you agree, Comrade Virág?
Will my children get anything? It won't
be just anyone who shoots me
You? Must you disturb me now?
Comrade Bastion, here is József
Pelikán, evidence for the state
He has accepted of his own free will,
no pressure brought to bear
The trial can be held
- Is that true?
- Yes; one tries to improve oneself
It would have been a pity
if you'd shot us
Let's get on with it, then
To work, comrades
Like that
- What type should he be?
- I'll leave you that to you
- You must have some idea
- You are the best judge, comrade
Should he be full of self-reproach?
Or perhaps naive, wondering?
A simple child of the people
That will be fine
Chin up, Comrade Pelikán
Work at it hard
Been a witness before?
Never
Get up on the stage
Recite a poem
You most know one
I'm a dike-keeper
Think. You must have
learnt a poem in school
"My mother's hen"
"My mother's hen", by Sándor Petõfi
On, mother's hen, what do I see?
Are you living in my room with me?
Well, to you God is good and kind...
...giving you a life so grand
Stop. You've got a lisp
No one ever said so
You take it from me:
a dreadful lisp
Please don't say that
Facts are stubborn things
Say quickly: she sells sea shells
on the sea shore
Now this: swan swum over the sea
I said you had a lisp
It can be improved with hard work.
Now, let's take it from the start
You get a character?
A simple worker; maybe
once an ill-treated waif
But you have to
decide that for yourself
But I wasn't a waif
The essence of the character is
wide-eyed astonishment
You put all your faith in someone; now
you realize you've been deceived
You should be seething with hatred.
Now start reading
I met Dániel in 1942
An aquaintance, Tivadar Galván...
Introduced him as
an illegal communist
He and his friends
needed a hiding place
Much too passive;
try to put some soul into it
I'll try
At that time I never guessed
he was a Fascist police informer...
...and a loathsome agent of
the imperialists
You should be seething.
Now recite it by heart
At that time I never guessed...
I've forgotten what I didn't guess
- Since when have you been
forgetful? - Since when what?
Exactly
Sit down, please
Thank you, comrades;
I've taken the material over
Repeat the following words
in the same order:
Ink-well, alligator, cornflower...
...kiss, lathe, toothpick.
That wasn't too many
- No, not too many
- You try now
Toothpick
From the beginning
Toothpick
- Don't you remember more?
- Not at the moment
Never mind. Please lie down here,
you'll fall asleep
It'll be easier to concentrate
in your sleep
Can you fall asleep,
or shall I apply hypnosis?
I'll try on my own
I met Zoltán Dániel in 1942
An aquaintance, Tivadar Galván,
introduced him to me
The witness's heart, chest and hearing
organs are generally satisfactory
Though I should note...
...he is extremely flat-footed
I'm on my feet all the time
That's no concern.
I'll prescribe a suitable shoe
Wear it, or I can't accept
responsibility. Get dressed
I think I've got it
Hungarian worker, 1950
- How do you feel?
- In what way?
With your appearance
I'm all right
Comrade Virág, externally
the witness is ready for the trial
Potentially a perfect witness,
Pelikán was allowed to visit home
Meanwhile, the Danube had flooded
and broken through the dike
I met Zoltán Dániel in 1942
At that time...
... I never guessed he was
a Fascist police informer
She sells sea shells on the sea shore
I met Zoltán Dániel in 1942
I haven't seen you for ages
Well, yes, the international
situation is intensifying
What do you mean? The bloody river
is sweeping everything away
- Which river?
- The Danube. Your Danube
Comrades, life is not
a whipped-cream cake
Do you call that
a whipped-cream cake?
Something's not quite right here
The day of the trial came round
Is everything all right?
There's a flood
Hard times, but we'll weather them;
life is not a whipped-cream cake
I know
- Why are you unshaven?
- My razor and suit are under water
That wicked water. But
we won't leave it all that
We've not worked all these weeks
in vain; this is our day
Appearances are important, too
A job for the major;
only shaving, not execution
Straight to the witnesses' room
Do you want to look through
you evidence?
No, I've rehearsed it so much
A priest studies his breviary until
his death. You know who said that?
Yes. Give it to me
We expect a very fine
testimony from you
Excuse me, but this is the sentence
Oh, dear, those sleepless nights
A horse has four legs
and yet it stumbles
Sit here
- Cream or soap?
- Soap
- What size collar?
- 43 I think
- A strong neck
- What?
I said good morning, Mr. Pelikán
Why are you here?
Sit still, or I'll cut you
I'm here for the same reason as you;
I'm a witness, too
What sort of witness are you,
Gulyás?
There are things
that only I can prove
I'm not in a mood for jokes
The witness Elemér Gulyás
I understand. The wretch knocked
your teeth out, that's not nice
You know that torturer?
Just as you do.
He got me in the kidneys
Both kidneys.
That was no joy, either
Even nowadays
I sometimes pass blood
Poor Comrade Virág
We can't nurse individual wounds
in the international situation
I've got butterflies in my stomach
Stage-fright. Take deep breaths
I've still got them
The witness József Pelikán
Courage. And always watch me
József Pelikán, you are a witness in
the trial of Dániel and his group
Do you bear any grudge
against the defendant?
We were more like friends
The law punishes perjury.
Do you swear to tell the whole truth?
How do you mean?
Testify the truth only
I'll try
- What is your name?
- József Pelikán
- Occupation?
- Originally a dike-keeper
The flood has something
to do with me
- That doesn't belong here
- Where then?
I have your statement before me
So you met Zoltán Dániel in 1942?
Yes, I met Zoltán Dániel in 1942
An aquaintance, Tivadar Galván...
...introduced him...
At that time I never guessed...
Guessed what?
That I'd meet a frogman
Stop a moment; that came later
Later
- Then let's look at the frogmen
- Let's
What did they look like?
What do you mean? Like frogs
There were gophers, too...
...but they were real
Have you anything
to add to your testimony?
Nothing. I mean, I have
I'd like to ask the judge
how this torturer got here
What do you mean?
I'd like to ask how this
bloodhound got here
...and how come
he's laughing in our faces
I wasn't laughing;
the witness is hallucinating
Hallucinating, damn it!
I object to a Fascist torturer
insulting me
Order, please, Pelikán
Do you maintain your testimony?
Feeling ill, Comrade Virág?
Pelikán, do you maintain
your testimony?
Because he's writhing
Nagging shock
Because this hangman ruined his
kidneys. Right, Comrade Virág?
Sometimes he still passes blood
Tell me to my face, you scum, what
lies did you tell about Zoltán Dániel?
The same thing you signed:
Dániel was a paid informer
You believe what this gorilla said?
Your Honour,
something's wrong here
I may be an idiot, but
everything's mixed up
The flood's sweeping everything
away, while this trash here...
Zoli, say something. Were you really
this henchman's agent?
Sit down
Elemér Gulyás, tell the witness
what you testified just now
Zoltán Dániel was a paid
informer for the Fascist police
What did you say, you sod?
I beg leave to amend my testimony.
Pelikán was a paid informer, too
I paid him. Dániel was an informer,
so was Pelikán
That's a good one!
Me, a police informer!
Look here, Your Honour:
he knocked them out
And who else was a police informer?
Comrade Virág? Comrade Bastion?
What's that? Me?
I heard it. I don't understand
We must look into it
József Pelikán, I ask you once more:
do you maintain your testimony?
You don't?
I told you I didn't;
are you people deaf?
Pelikán returned to prison.
The days passed and the years...
I'm afraid there's a hitch.
Rabbit's out of season...
...but here's beef with dumplings,
will that do?
Csopak Riesling?
Out of stock. I've brought
St. George Hill; it's as strong
- Would you like some?
- I don't want to rob you. After all...
Tomorrow morning.
But go on, have some.
- Any children?
- Eight
It's not easy
- No, it's not easy
- It certainly isn't
Good dumplings?
I always recommend them
to the condemned
and they're always grateful
They all like them, whatever
their political views
Of course, some can't eat at all;
then I eat them myself
Delicious dumplings
shouldn't go to waste
Do you want a priest?
Not if I don't have to
Of course. I'm completely mixed up
That was very good.
If only I had another life
That's right
I'm afraid I have to go
We've had a good chat
I've a seminar tomorrow
and I haven't learnt a word
You could help me
Me?
Go on, unless you want to sleep
It's not because of sleep,
it's because I'm ill-qualified
It's only a beginner's course,
child's play to you
But it's vital for me;
I've got a family to support
Rum. Have some
Have a steady drink
Can you tell me what the
Parliamentary Boycott was?
- I can't imagine
- Think, Pelikán
Parliamentary Boycott? Everyone
should keep their mouth shut, I guess
You see, you know it
And what about the
dictatorship of the proletariat?
It's when the proles dictate.
Don't you understand that?
What about the three functions?
I know one
We must strike down the counter-
revolutionary Fascist band
Strike them down...
And the other two?
Isn't that enough?
A drop more, then I may remember
I don't get it; it's never
happened before
If the executioner's ill, or got
family business there's his deputy
And if anything happens to the
deputy, he's got a deputy
I've never known
an execution held up
- I can wait
- It's not good to wait. Sit down
- Why?
- It makes it a bit easier
I don't get it
- Who is Dr. Kotász?
- The state executioner
Why the hell are you
yelling at this hour?
There's a condemned man here...
...and there's no one
to carry out the sentence
I'll be right down
Who are you?
József Pelikán. Sorry to bother you,
but I'm to be hanged
What shambles. Well, congratulations,
you're going to be rehabilitated
I'd rather be hanged, please
Rehabilitation means
that you're innocent
So hurry home now.
You'll get the money by post
Could you tell me
about Zoltán Dániel?
He's been home a week now
You gobbled the dumplings,
you drank the wine
You're not being hanged, you'll
even got some cash. What a gang!
Why are you day-dreaming here?
Clear off, before I lose my temper
- Can you tell me what day it is?
- Wednesday
- What month?
- April
- What's the level of the Danube?
- Do you want my girl, too?
So Pelikán returned to the dike
Once again the years passed
What have you got against me?
Comrade Virág! How are you,
Comrade Virág?
These are the people I fought for.
I got a stomach ulcer
because of them
Never mind. You'll all be begging
me to come back one day
I wouldn't like to swear to that
Why does history go on like this?
So that humanity can cheerfully
take leave of its past. - Marx
The end.
