YOU GET TO PICK WHO DARES YOU.
RULE THREE --
YOU MUST PERFORM THE DARE

AND IF YOU DON'T...

WHAT?
NOW, IF THERE'S A DARE
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DO,
YOU CAN CHALLENGE THE PERSON
WHO DARED YOU, AND THEY HAVE
TO DO IT, BUT IF THEY
DO IT, YOU GET SHAVED.
SO, DON'T GO DARING PEOPLE
TO DO THINGS YOU WOULDN'T DO,
BECAUSE IT BACKFIRES.

I DIDN'T KNOW.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DARED HER.
[SOBBING]
THAT WASN'T YOUR FAULT, CHAPIN.
YES, IT WAS.
NO, IT WASN'T.
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE CURRENT.

BY DEFAULT.
CHAPIN.
[CHUCKLES]

I WILL.
HI, DAD.
YEAH.
I KNOW IT'S LATE, BUT I WAS JUST
CALLING BECAUSE...
YEAH, I-I KNOW, BUT...
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO
CALL BECAUSE...
FINE.
I WON'T.

FRIENDS STICK. DADS DON'T.
I WANT TO.
LET'S DO IT.
[CLIPPER BUZZES]
[CRYING]
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?
IT'S REALLY SAD.
BUT IT'S MY HAIR.
I CAN KNIT YOU A HAT.
[BREATHES DEEPLY]
HEY, EVE...
SO, WHAT'S YOUR MOM
GONNA SAY ABOUT YOUR HAIR?
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SPEAK
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A STROKE.

I BETTER GET HOME.
I CAN DROP YOU OFF.
I GOT WHEELS.
OKAY.
OKAY, WELL, I GUESS I'LL JUST --
STILL FRIENDS?
