 WHAT WAS THAT?
 ME AND MY BROTHER,
         WE'D JUST GOT
      OUT OF THE SHOWER,
       AND HE WAS ABOUT
  TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME.
       AND WHILE MY MOM
    WAS TAKING CARE OF HIM
        'CAUSE HE'S TINY,
 - I WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM,
   DRYING OFF, WATCHING TV. 
     - FIVE, FOUR, THREE...
     IN A MIAMI, FLORIDA,
       COURTROOM TODAY,
  FORMER PANAMANIAN DICTATOR,
       MANUEL NORIEGA--
        - HEY, CHRIS. 
  - WHOEVER THE NEWSCASTER WAS
     STARTS KIND OF GETTING
        MY ATTENTION...
          - CHRIS. 
         - SAYING LIKE,
   "HEY, CHRIS. HEY, CHRIS."
 HEY, CHRIS.
      - AND IT'S SAYING,
         "DON'T WORRY."
        - DON'T WORRY.
   EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.
         AND ONE DAY,
        WE'LL BE BACK.
 IT TERRIFIED ME.
     I REMEMBER SCREAMING
        TO GET MY MOM,
     BRINGING HER TO THE TV,
   WHO NOW WAS BACK TO DOING
      NORMAL NEWSCASTING,
       BECAUSE THAT'S,
    YOU KNOW, WHAT IT WAS.
      AND HER BASICALLY
   EXPLAINING TO ME, LIKE,
   "TVs DON'T TALK TO YOU.
     THAT'S RIDICULOUS."
      I'M DISENCHANTED,
    BECAUSE NOW I THOUGHT
SOMETHING REALLY COOL HAPPENED,
    AND THAT'S NOT A THING
         I REMEMBER,
      I KNOW IT WAS THERE.
        AND, YOU KNOW,
      I WAS WIDE AWAKE.
       I HAD LITERALLY
JUST GOTTEN OUT OF THE SHOWER,
     AND IT WAS THIS VERY
OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCE FOR ME
         BECAUSE NOW,
     AS A FIVE-YEAR-OLD,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I BELONGED.
 OKAY. SET.
 SO HOW DID THIS START, JEFF?
         UM, PROBABLY
     ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.
MY GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME AND I
      WERE TALKING ABOUT
DIFFERENT PARANORMAL STORIES,
  AND SHE STARTED TELLING ME
     ABOUT HOW SOMETIMES
        SHE'D WAKE UP
  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
      JUST, LIKE, UNABLE
     TO MOVE OR BREATHE.
    SHE SAID IT FELT LIKE
        THERE'S, LIKE,
       AN EVIL PRESENCE
    IN THE ROOM WITH HER,
 AND THEY WOULD JUST, LIKE--
 KIND OF, LIKE, TORMENT HER.
   AND SHE WOULD EVENTUALLY
           WAKE UP,
       AND IT'D BE LIKE
     IT WAS JUST A DREAM.
    AFTER SHE TOLD ME THAT,
     I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
     WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.
   I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I GOT
INVOLVED WITH SOME CRAZY GIRL."
  AND I JUST KIND OF CHANGED
         THE SUBJECT,
       STARTED TALKING
    ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
   THEN ABOUT A WEEK LATER,
 I LAID DOWN TO GO TO SLEEP.
     AND JUST AS I STARTED
         TO DRIFT OFF,
        I FELT MY BODY
 JUST BECOME EXTREMELY HEAVY.
   IT WAS LIKE I FELL ASLEEP,
       BUT THEN WOKE UP
     AT THE SAME INSTANT.
       AND MY WHOLE BODY
       STARTED TINGLING.
       IT JUST FELT LIKE
     REALLY WEIGHTED DOWN,
 LIKE SOMETHING WAS PULLING ME.
      AND I HEARD THIS,
         LIKE, SOUND.
 IT WASN'T OUTSIDE OF MY HEAD,
       BUT IT WAS JUST
      INSIDE OF MY HEAD.
       IT JUST SOUNDED
    LIKE A WASHING MACHINE
 THAT KIND OF OUT OF BALANCE
        OR SOMETHING,
JUST BANGING AGAINST THE WALL,
AND JUST REALLY TERRIFIED ME.
      I KIND OF STARTED,
     LIKE, FREAKING OUT,
          AND, LIKE,
    STARTED SEEING THINGS.
   AND IT WAS REALLY BIZARRE.
 WELL, WHAT DID YOU SEE?
   UM, IT WAS KIND OF LIKE--
     IT WAS KIND OF LIKE...
   ALL THESE DIFFERENT COLORS,
    LIKE A LASER LIGHT SHOW
         OR SOMETHING,
    LIKE, I WAS LIKE FLYING
  THROUGH, LIKE, A TIME WARP.
 IT JUST HAD ALL THESE COLORS
  JUST, LIKE, SHOOTING AT ME
        IN A LIGHT SHOW.
    AND I FOUND THAT I HAD
  ZERO CONTROL OVER MY BODY.
   LIKE, NO MATTER HOW HARD
           I TRIED,
   I COULDN'T MOVE MY ARMS,
       MY LEGS, NOTHING.
  AND SO I REALLY STARTED TO
  KIND OF HAVE A PANIC ATTACK
     BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
      WHAT WAS GOING ON.
      I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.
     I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE
    A STROKE OR SOMETHING.
        NOTHING WORKED.
       I COULDN'T MOVE.
I HAD NO CONTROL OVER ANYTHING.
    FINALLY I DECIDED, WELL,
 I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO BUILD UP
       ALL THE STRENGTH
       THAT I HAVE IN ME
      JUST TO GET MYSELF
         TO ROLL OVER
      ONTO MY GIRLFRIEND
  HOPING THAT IT WAKES HER UP.
      SO IT WAS JUST LIKE
    THIS LAST-DITCH EFFORT
      OF EVERYTHING I HAD,
         I JUST, LIKE,
       WRENCHED MY BODY.
   AS SOON AS I FLIPPED OVER
   ON TOP OF HER, I WOKE UP.
    AND I WAS STILL LAYING
    IN MY ORIGINAL POSITION
  LIKE NONE OF IT HAD HAPPENED.
 I WAS JUST COMPLETELY SHOCKED.
         I HAD NO IDEA
      WHAT WAS GOING ON.
      I JUST DID NOT KNOW
      WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.
   AFTER THAT, IT WAS LIKE,
         CONSTANTLY,
      NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
         AFTER NIGHT,
     FOR A COUPLE WEEKS,
  MAYBE EVEN A MONTH OR SO.
             AND...
     I JUST DID NOT KNOW
HOW TO PROCESS IT AT THE TIME.
   AND SO, FINALLY, I TOLD
   MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT.
      I WAS LIKE, "OKAY,
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME."
       "I THINK I NEED
     TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.
 I THINK I'M HAVING STROKES,
      LIKE MINI-STROKES,
   OR SEIZURES MAYBE EVEN,"
       AND SHE'S LIKE,
     "NO, THAT'S EXACTLY
     WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.
   THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
     TO TELL YOU ABOUT."
 I WAS ABOUT 29 YEARS OLD.
 MM-HMM.
     AND HERE IN THIS ROOM,
  AS I WOULD LAY DOWN TO SLEEP,
  I'D START FEELING TINGLING
          IN MY FEET,
   AND THEN I WOULD FEEL IT
      RISE UP MY LEGS...
         UP MY TORSO,
         ON MY HANDS,
   AND I'D ALSO HEAR BUZZING.
          YOU KNOW,
      LIKE BEES BUZZING.
  THAT'S WHEN THESE EPISODES
         WOULD START.
     I WOULD FEEL TINGLING
       AND I WOULD GET--
      I'D FEEL THE ENERGY.
I FELT THAT MY MIND WAS AWAKE,
    BUT MY BODY WAS STIFF.
   I'D TRY TO MOVE MY HEAD
      FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
           I JUST--
       I COULDN'T MOVE.
       AND IN THAT MOMENT,
     I WOULD HEAR TAPPING
        ON THE WINDOW.
     THEY WOULD TAP HERE.
    I WOULD HEAR TAPPING.
   AND I'M THINKING, "WELL,
  MAYBE IT'S JUST A SQUIRREL
        OR A RACCOON,"
  BUT IT WAS LIKE A PATTERN.
   IT WAS DEFINITELY A KNOCK.
  AND I WOULD OPEN MY EYES,
AND I'D LOOK TOWARD THE WINDOW,
    AND THEN IT WOULD STOP.
       BUT AFTER A WHILE,
      I STARTED FEELING
     AN ACTUAL PRESENCE.
AND I WOULD FEEL THIS PRESENCE
       RIGHT NEXT TO ME
  TRYING TO TAKE MY SOUL OUT.
IT WOULD TORTURE ME AT NIGHT,
AND I WOULD TRY AND FIGHT IT,
      BUT I FELT I WAS--
    MY BODY FELT PARALYZED.
    IT WAS JUST SO STRONG
  THAT I WOULD JUST LET GO,
   AND THEN I'D FEEL MYSELF
     FLOATING IN THE AIR.
AND I COULD TRY AND SEE MYSELF,
 BUT I WOULD JUST SEE A BLUR.
        AND IT HAPPENED
     FOR MANY YEARS, AND--
     WHEN I WAS PREGNANT
      WITH MY DAUGHTER,
 AND I FELT THE BABY AS WELL,
     TRYING TO COME OUT.
BUT I WAS TRYING TO FIGHT IT,
 AND I WAS SAYING, "NO, NO."
    SO I WOULD PULL BACK.
IT'S LIKE IF I WOULD PULL BACK.
 AND IT WOULD PULL, YOU KNOW,
        THE OTHER WAY.
 WHEN I WAS IN
      MY MID TO LATE 20S,
  I HAD A REALLY AWFUL BREAKUP.
   I WAS MISERABLE BECAUSE
   I WAS SO BROKENHEARTED.
AND I STARTED MY FIRST TEACHING
  JOB AROUND THE SAME TIME,
 SO I WAS SUPER STRESSED-OUT
          FROM THAT.
 I WOULD JUST SEE THIS, LIKE,
DARK FIGURE BY THE BOOKSHELVES,
    AND I COULD NOT MOVE,
AND IT WAS FUCKING TERRIFYING.
        I DIDN'T KNOW
     WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
  I DID THINK THAT SOMEBODY
          HAD BROKEN
 INTO MY APARTMENT AT FIRST,
    BECAUSE AT THAT POINT,
  MY ROOMMATE AND I LIVED--
   I HAD A ROOMMATE THEN--
   WE LIVED ON FOURTH STREET,
 AND WE WERE ON THE TOP FLOOR
       OF THE BUILDING.
       AND OUR BUILDING
 WAS REALLY EASY TO GET INTO.
    LIKE, THE DOOR IN FROM
 THE BALCONY TO OUR APARTMENT
     DIDN'T REALLY LOCK,
    SO I THINK I WAS LIKE,
          "OH, FUCK,
 SOMEBODY ACTUALLY BROKE IN."
 TO BE LYING THERE AND KNOW,
       I WANT TO MOVE,
   AND I'M TRYING TO MOVE,
        AND I CANNOT--
     ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.
 I'VE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM
 WITH STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
       SLIPPING IN AND OUT
      OF DIFFERENT STATES
       OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
      AND I DO REMEMBER...
       WHEN I WAS VERY,
         VERY YOUNG--
         TWO, THREE,
    I WAS STILL IN A CRIB.
         AND THERE WAS
    A PLUG-IN NIGHT LIGHT,
    AND IT WAS THAT ORANGE
          CAST COLOR.
      AND IT WAS ALL DARK
 EXCEPT FOR THAT ORANGE CAST,
    AND THE ROOM TURNED RED,
   AND I FELT LIKE SOMETHING
     WAS COMING AFTER ME,
      AND I CUDDLED DOWN
      AND COVERED MYSELF.
  IT WAS MY EARLIEST MEMORY
       OF THE SCARINESS
     THAT HAPPENED TO ME
   AND CONTINUED TO HAPPEN.
  LAYING DOWN TO GO TO SLEEP,
I WOULD FEEL UTTERLY EXHAUSTED,
         ALMOST AS IF
   I HAD JUST BEEN DRUGGED.
       I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
 HAVING BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL,
 I UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
        IT'S JUST LIKE
     I HAD BEEN INJECTED.
   AND MY EYES SEALED SHUT.
     MY MOUTH SEALED SHUT.
   AND IT'S AS IF EVERYTHING
      WAS SHUTTING DOWN,
   EXCEPT FOR MY AWARENESS,
       MY CONSCIOUSNESS.
     AND THEN I COULD FEEL
         A VIBRATION.
  SOMETIMES IT WAS SO INTENSE,
         IT FELT LIKE
      BEING ELECTROCUTED,
     BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY
   AN ELECTRICAL VIBRATION.
    I BEGAN HEARING VOICES
          AND SCREAMS
-  AND CRYING... 
    AND ALL OF THIS REALLY
       EMOTIONAL DRAMA,
      YELLING TO CRYING,
   BUT ALL NEGATIVE EMOTION,
 ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT VOICES.
     AND THEN THAT IS WHEN
        THE SHADOW MAN
      WOULD COME TOWARD ME.
 STUPID, STUPID, STUPID,
    STUPID, STUPID! STUPID!
 AND HE LOOKED JUST LIKE
  A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SHADOW,
     OUTLINED, JUST PERFECT.
     AND HE WOULD WALK...
          DISJOINTED.
        AND HE BROUGHT
    THE VIBRATION WITH HIM.
          IT'S AS IF
  IT WAS EMANATING FROM HIM.
 AND HE WOULD COME TOWARDS ME,
  AND I WOULD JUST FEEL THAT.
          HEAR-- HEAR--
         I WOULD HEAR
   ALL THE SOUNDS OF HELL--
         I DON'T KNOW
   ANY OTHER WAY TO PUT IT--
  AND FEEL HIS AWFUL VIBRATION.
       AND I WOULD HAVE
   A FIGHT/FLIGHT RESPONSE,
    AND I WOULD COMPLETELY,
     YOU KNOW, FREAK OUT,
 AND TRY TO SCREAM OR GET AWAY.
        AND MANY TIMES,
 THE INTENSITY JUST CONTINUED.
      I WAS VERY SCARED,
     AND I WAS UPSTAIRS,
AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE ANYBODY
     WAS GONNA GET TO ME
         IF I SCREAMED.
        IT'S VERY DARK.
   AND IT SCARED ME FOREVER.
 I MEAN, IT REALLY SCARED ME
    TO THE END OF MY WITS.
       AND IF ANYTHING
  WAS GONNA DRIVE ME INSANE,
     IT WAS GONNA BE THAT.
       WHAT HAPPENS IS
 WHEN YOU'RE FALLING ASLEEP,
YOU'LL GET AN ELECTRICAL SHOCK
      THROUGH YOUR BODY
JUST AS YOU'RE FALLING ASLEEP,
AND THAT'S THE USUAL INDICATION
    THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
     A VISIT THAT NIGHT.
    THEN YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP,
   AND THEN YOU'LL WAKE UP,
 AND YOU'RE TOTALLY PARALYZED,
         YOU CAN'T MOVE.
          UM, AND...
 THERE'S STATIC IN THE ROOM.
  AND YOU'RE BEING VISITED.
   THEY'LL CIRCLE YOUR BED,
      AND NOW AND AGAIN,
  THEY'LL TRY AND TOUCH YOU.
         THE FIRST ONE
  IS A GENERIC SHADOW PERSON,
    WHICH IS JUST BASICALLY
   AN OUTLINE OF ME AND YOU
        ON A SUNNY DAY,
       ON THE PAVEMENT,
        ON THE SIDEWALK
        IN A 3-D FORM.
        AND THE SECOND--
      THE SECOND ENTITY,
     WHICH IS THE HAT MAN,
  SEEMS TO HAVE A DIRECT LINK
           TO THEM.
      HE'S-- HE'S A VERY
     AUTHORITARIAN FIGURE.
       HE'S VERY MENACING.
           HE'S VERY--
     HE'S IN CHARGE OF THEM.
         HIS MINIONS,
         SO TO SPEAK.
           AND, UM...
        THEY'RE A TEAM.
          IT'S HELL.
   HE'S AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL.
   IT ALL STARTS WITH THAT
      ELECTRICAL SHOCK.
 I HAVE MY TWO SEPARATE LIVES.
     I HAVE MY LIFE LIKE
 WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT IT,
AND IT'S COOL AND I GO TO WORK.
     THEN WHEN I GO TO BED,
 I HAVE THIS WHOLE OTHER LIFE
  THAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
    WHEN IT FIRST STARTED,
 IT WAS PRETTY INTERMITTENT.
      IT WASN'T EVERY DAY.
     DON'T KNOW THE AGE.
      AROUND THIS TIME.
    MY BROTHER DIDN'T LIVE
       WITH US ANYMORE,
       AND I HAD MY ROOM
        ALL TO MYSELF.
      IT'S KIND OF FUNNY
     'CAUSE I CAN REMEMBER
      MY BED HAD COLLAPSED,
  ONTO A BOX OF BEANIE BABIES
    THAT MY MOM COLLECTED.
   MY MOM WAS A BIG COLLECTOR.
 AND SO MY BED KIND OF PIVOTS,
            RIGHT?
     ON TOP OF THIS THING
       THERE'S A FRAME,
        THE BED PIVOTING.
        AND I REMEMBER
     THE BED WAS PIVOTED,
    ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT,
         WITH MY FEET
     CLOSER TO THE GROUND
    AND MY HEAD HIGHER UP,
        LIKE A SEESAW.
        AND I REMEMBER
     THE PARALYSIS STARTS,
  AND I CAN SEE THE DOOR FRAME.
       LIKE I CAN SEE--
   I'M LOOKING DIRECTLY AT--
           YOU KNOW,
    I'M LOOKING AT A WALL,
   AND THE DOOR IS RIGHT HERE.
 SO, HERE'S A BED, THERE'S ME,
    THEN STRAIGHT FORWARD,
 THERE'S THE DOOR THAT EXITS,
            RIGHT?
    AND THERE'S THE LIGHT
      FROM THE HALLWAY.
    AND I REMEMBER SEEING,
           YOU KNOW,
  YOUR TRADITIONAL DARKNESS,
        YOUR, YOU KNOW,
   EVERYTHING KIND OF EXISTS
          IN SHADOWS.
   I MEAN, IT ALL LOOKS LIKE
         IT'S MOVING.
  ALL THE DARKNESS LOOKS ALIVE.
    BUT I REMEMBER SEEING...
   PEOPLE, BEINGS, WHATEVER,
        JUST COMING IN.
          THEY JUST--
          THEY LOOK--
       THEY LOOK LIKE A--
   IF A PERSON WERE TO WALK
     IN FRONT OF A LIGHT,
       AND THEIR SHADOW
     WERE TO FOLLOW THEM,
  THEY LOOKED LIKE AN ALMOST--
   MORE SHADOW-LIKE VERSION
         OF A SHADOW.
     LIKE-- AND KIND OF...
           JUST...
     DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
    LIKE, I REMEMBER NOW,
             UM,
THAT THEY WOULD-- THEY JUST--
      SHADOWS MOVING IN,
       LIKE, THEY WOULD
 KIND OF INTERSECT THE LIGHT.
 I ACTUALLY-- I REMEMBER THIS
       KIND OF WELL NOW,
       BECAUSE I WAS ON
       THIS WEIRD TILT,
     SO IT WASN'T JUST ME
         LOOKING UP,
     OR, LIKE, BEING ABLE
    TO KIND OF SEE AROUND.
     THIS WAS ME LOOKING
    STRAIGHT AT THE DOOR.
  AND JUST SEEING THESE THINGS.
 I REMEMBER IN THE PARALYSIS,
 I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE REAL.
  I ALWAYS THINK THEY'RE REAL.
      EVEN TO THIS DAY,
I THINK THESE THINGS ARE REAL
      IN SOME SENSE, UM...
     BUT WHEN I WOKE UP,
     THEY WEREN'T THERE.
      IT WAS DEFINITELY
        THE FIRST TIME
     THAT I SAW SOMETHING
       THAT MADE THINK
      THAT THIS WAS MORE
 THAN JUST A SLEEP DISORDER.
   I DO REMEMBER IT HAPPENING
         AS FAR BACK
 AS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.
     AS FAR BACK AS MAYBE
    FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD.
           AND THEN
    THE SAME THING HAPPENED
      WHEN I WAS ABOUT 15.
      DURING THAT TIME,
 I WAS A REBELLIOUS TEENAGER,
SO I WAS REALLY OUT OF CONTROL
      AND FEELING, LIKE,
       UNLOVED AND STUFF.
       I DON'T KNOW HOW
        I GOT THAT WAY,
    BUT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
     A BROKENNESS INSIDE,
   LIKE, I WAS JUST BROKEN,
      SPIRITUALLY BROKEN.
         AND THAT TIME,
   I WAS IN A TWO-STORY HOME
         IN TORRANCE,
      THE CITY OF TORRANCE.
     IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE
         OF THE NIGHT,
      BUT I WAS WIDE AWAKE.
  I WAS LITERALLY WIDE AWAKE.
      MY EYES WERE OPEN.
     BUT I COULD NOW FEEL
        THIS PRESENCE,
  THIS EVIL PRESENCE BEHIND ME.
      LYING ON MY SIDE,
    LIKE ON MY LEFT SIDE--
      I'M A SIDE SLEEPER--
      AND THEN THE DOOR
        IS BEHIND ME.
        AND-- AND THEN
   I COULD FEEL THE PRESENCE
      JUST RIGHT BEHIND ME.
        AND I REMEMBER
       JUST TRYING TO--
        WANTING TO MOVE
       AND TURN AROUND,
 BUT I COULD NOT LIFT A FINGER.
        AGAIN, IT WAS--
     I WAS JUST FROZEN...
       UTTERLY IN TERROR.
        AND IT WAS THE--
      IF I COULD DESCRIBE
 WHAT DEATH WOULD FEEL LIKE--
   AND IT'S A KIND OF HORROR
        THAT IS WORSE
   THAN LIKE IN THE MOVIES.
    UM, IT'S AN ICY-COLD,
         KIND OF DARK
  EVIL SOMETHING'S IN THE ROOM,
      AND IT'S WATCHING ME.
     THAT'S THE SCARY PART.
     THAT YOU FEEL A SENSE
    THAT IT'S WATCHING YOU.
      AND IT'S-- AND IT'S--
       AND IT'S MAKING
       YOU FEEL AFRAID.
       AND IT WANTS YOU
       TO FEEL AFRAID.
 I WAS A YEAR AND A HALF OLD,
          PROBABLY.
  AND I WAS BORN AND RAISED
       IN RURAL VERMONT
IN AN OLD FARMHOUSE ABOUT 100,
     100-PLUS YEARS OLD,
   AND I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
        OF THE WOODS.
   UM, SO IT WAS VERY DARK
       AND VERY QUIET,
       JUST PITCH SILENCE,
       WHICH, YOU KNOW,
  ITSELF KIND OF HAS A SOUND.
           UM, AND--
        SO HERE I AM,
         I'M A BABY.
          I WAKE UP
      AND I CAN'T MOVE.
        I'M IN MY CRIB.
    AND SO I'M SURROUNDED
         BY THE BARS
   OF THE CRIB ON ALL SIDES.
        AND ABOVE ME,
   AT THE END OF THE CRIB,
       BEFORE THE WINDOW,
   ARE TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC...
    KIND OF, BEINGS, I GUESS.
        UH, BEST WORD
      TO DESCRIBE THEM.
 I STILL REMEMBER THEM VIVIDLY
    BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY
       MY FIRST MEMORY.
          SO IN A WAY,
         IT'S KIND OF
 MY AWAKENING INTO THE WORLD.
             DARK.
         THEY ALWAYS
    JUST LOOK SO CARTOONY.
I'VE TRIED TO DRAW THEM BEFORE,
 AND IT JUST LOOKS SO GOOFY.
  IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE, UH,
 THE SAME MALEVOLENT IMPACT.
      AND THEIR SKIN, UM,
  WAS LIKE TELEVISION STATIC.
    UM, YOU KNOW, IT HAD,
          YOU KNOW--
       LIKE AN OLD TV,
     WHEN THE SIGNAL'S--
   WHEN YOU'RE NOT GETTING
        A GOOD SIGNAL.
   IT HAD THAT SAME KIND OF
           TEXTURE,
 THAT KIND OF--
       THEY WERE TALL,
        KIND OF THIN,
   THESE KIND OF THIN LIMBS
   AND THESE LONG FINGERS.
         AND THEY HAD
   THESE VERY SIMPLE FACES,
 ALMOST CARTOONISH FACES OF,
          YOU KNOW,
     THESE TWO INKY EYES
   AND THIS BIG INKY SMILE
        ON THEIR FACE
       THAT'S KIND OF--
   IT'S TICKLING, TICKLING,
      TICKLING FINGERS,
  THESE, LIKE, LONG, SLENDER--
      THEY WERE LAUGHING.
AND HERE'S MY LITTLE FEET,
     YOU KNOW.
    THEY WERE TICKLING ME.
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS PARALYZED.
       I COULDN'T MOVE,
  AND I COULDN'T STOP THEM.
    AND THEY WERE LAUGHING
           ABOUT IT.
THERE WAS KIND OF LIKE LAUGHTER.
       LIKE, AH-HA-HA.
   THEY WERE, LIKE, THERE,
          YOU KNOW?
           AND BARS,
  THESE TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC
     THINGS, THE WINDOWS.
          YOU KNOW,
  ACCORDING TO MY PARENTS--
    BUT I KEPT ON REPEATING
      THE WORDS "ZINES."
       LIKE, Z-I-N-E-S,
     OVER AND OVER AGAIN
    IN LIKE KIND OF A PANIC.
        KIND OF LIKE,
    "ZINES, ZINES, ZINES,"
       YOU KNOW, LIKE,
     HANGING ON TO THEM.
   AND SO MAYBE AS A CHILD,
          YOU KNOW,
      SEEING THESE KIND
      OF ANTHROPOMORPHIC
SORT OF NOT HUMAN BUT HUMAN--
            UH...
     SO I WOULDN'T SLEEP
      IN MY CRIB AGAIN.
       MY PARENTS TRIED
    TO PUT ME IN MY CRIB,
   AND I JUST WOULDN'T DO IT.
     I WOULD JUST SCREAM
          AND SCREAM
    AND SCREAM AND SCREAM
         AND SCREAM.
         I MADE THIS
    AS A HALLOWEEN COSTUME
        SOME YEARS AGO.
      NOW YOU'RE STARING
 INTO MY CHILDHOOD RIGHT NOW.
        I DON'T KNOW.
         IS IT SCARY?
 DID YOU SEEK ANY MEDICAL HELP?
  NO, BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
      I WAS GOING CRAZY.
I KNEW WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING
          WAS REAL.
  I DIDN'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE
     TO COME AND TELL ME,
  "WELL, NO, THAT'S NOT REAL."
 DID YOU SEEK ANY KIND OF HELP?
  DID YOU TRY TO DO ANYTHING
  TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING?
    DID I GET AN EXORCIST?
  NO, I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH.
     I GOT ON THE INTERNET
          VERY EARLY
   COMPARED TO MOST PEOPLE,
      IN ABOUT '94 MAYBE.
     I'M TOTALLY GUESSING.
           '94, '95.
      AND ONE OF THE VERY
   FIRST THINGS I LOOKED UP,
      WAS "THE SHADOWMAN"
       AND "NIGHTMARE."
       AND FROM THERE,
    IN THE SEARCH ENGINES,
   IT WASN'T VERY FAR DOWN
 THE PAGE-- SLEEP PARALYSIS.
       I WAS LIKE, WAIT,
 SLEEP FROZEN, SLEEP PARALYSIS.
    AND I CALLED MY MOM UP
          RIGHT AWAY.
  I SAID, "OH, MY GOSH, MOM,
     IT'S SLEEP PARALYSIS.
   THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT.
        IT'S A THING."
   SHE WAS VERY EXCITED, TOO,
 AND SHE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND
MORE ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE FELT
 THAT MAYBE SOMETHING MEDICAL
        COULD BE DONE
  SO THAT WE NO LONGER HAD IT.
 BECAUSE WHEN THE SCIENTISTS
        FIGURE IT OUT,
  THEY FIGURE OUT A MEDICINE
    TO GO WITH IT, RIGHT?
   SO WE FELT THAT WE WOULD
    ACTUALLY HAVE ANSWERS
 AND MEDICATION OR SOMETHING
      TO MAKE IT BETTER.
      I CALLED A DOCTOR
   AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT
  AND CAME IN, AND EXPLAINED
  TO THEM WHAT WAS GOING ON,
     AND MY DOCTOR SAID--
  SHE WAS KIND OF CONCERNED
THAT MAYBE I WAS HAVING SEIZURES
    WHILE I WAS SLEEPING.
SO SHE SET ME UP FOR A CAT SCAN,
     AN EEG AND ALL THAT.
    SO I WENT IN FOR THOSE,
        AND MY RESULTS
FOR THE CAT SCAN WERE NORMAL,
 BUT THE EEG CAME BACK WITH--
 SAID I HAD ABNORMAL RESULTS.
      THAT'S ALL SHE SAID.
          "YOU HAVE
   SOME ABNORMAL READINGS.
  "YOU HAVE SLEEP PARALYSIS.
 IT'S JUST CAUSED BY STRESS.
     SO IF YOU JUST MAKE
   SOME LIFESTYLE CHANGES,
        IT'LL GO AWAY."
WELL, YOU GET A CUT-AND-PASTE
     ANSWER FROM DOCTORS,
      "YOU'RE STRESSED.
   CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE,"
        WITHOUT ASKING
   WHAT YOUR LIFESTYLE IS.
       THERE'S NO ANSWER.
  IT'S JUST A DISMISSAL OF--
 BASICALLY, THEY DON'T KNOW.
    AND IF THEY DON'T KNOW,
      THEN THEY DON'T--
       THEY DON'T CARE.
   EVERY TIME I WOULD TALK
TO A PSYCHIATRIST, I'D BE LIKE,
"I'M HAVING THIS SLEEP PROBLEM.
    THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.
  THIS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE."
 THEY'D BE LIKE, "OKAY, OKAY.
TELL ME ABOUT, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
 HOW ARE YOU DOING AT HOME?"
 AND I WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO BE
      LIKE, "NO, NO, NO,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS HIDEOUS
    SLEEP PROBLEM I HAVE."
SHE SEEMED REALLY INTERESTED.
    SHE SORT OF LEANS IN.
       AND SHE'S LIKE,
   "IT'S NOT SLEEP APNEA."
 AND I WAS LIKE, "I KNOW THAT."
      AND SHE JUST SAID,
  "THAT'S REALLY MESSED UP."
 I REMEMBER, LIKE,
      THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
    AFTER IT WOULD HAPPEN,
 I'D LAY IN BED BEING SO SCARED
THAT IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.
   AND THEN, MOST ASSUREDLY,
     IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN
 'CAUSE I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT
    AND OBSESSING ABOUT IT.
  LIKE, WHEN I'D GO THROUGH
      THESE DRY SPELLS,
          BASICALLY,
  WHERE I WASN'T HAVING IT,
IF I STARTED TELLING SOMEBODY
          ABOUT IT,
      THEN IT WAS, LIKE,
    ALMOST 100% GUARANTEED
       THAT I WAS GONNA
     HAVE IT THAT NIGHT.
          THIS IS IN
    OUR COLLEGE APARTMENT.
 OKAY. 
       - SO, I WAS HERE.
   I HAD MY BED RIGHT HERE...
     AND THEN MY ROOMMATE
        WAS RIGHT HERE.
         AND THE BLOBS--
   I SAW THESE BLACK BLOBS--
        I COULD SEE THEM.
        BLOBS OF BLACK,
      COMING ONTO MY BED.
 AND I COULD SEE MY ROOMMATE,
 JUST IN THE CORNER OVER THERE,
       AND I WAS TRYING
      TO SCREAM HER NAME
   SO THAT SHE COULD HELP ME.
   AND SHE'S SLEEPING AWAY,
  AND I'M STRAINING TO TALK.
    AND NOTHING CAN COME OUT.
 I'M A DIVER,
    AND I'VE EXPERIENCED--
   WELL, BEEN CLOSE TO DEATH
      QUITE A FEW TIMES.
      I'M A DEEP DIVER,
 BUT NOTHING'S AS TERRIFYING,
        AS WHAT HAPPENS,
      AND I HAVE IT ONCE
       OR TWICE A WEEK.
 WHEN I WAS ABOUT 10
 IS WHEN IT STARTED TO HAPPEN,
   EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY DAY
          OF MY LIFE.
  NOBODY EVER REALLY TOOK ME
ENTIRELY SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW,
         EVEN THOUGH
I WAS A PETRIFIED LITTLE BOY,
YOU KNOW, TERRIFIED TO BE ALONE,
      HATED MY BEDROOM,
HATED THE ROOM BELOW MY BEDROOM,
   AND HAD SLEEP PARALYSIS
      PROBABLY EVERY NIGHT.
           YOU KNOW,
   HAD VOICES TALKING TO ME
   IN THE SLEEP PARALYSIS,
  VERY ABUSIVE EXPERIENCES.
 HEY, FORREST.
-  HEY, FORREST. 
-  HEY, FORREST.
 YOU JUST WON THE
GIANT INSECT OF THE MONTH CLUB.
 INSECT OF THE MONTH CLUB.
 WE'RE SENDING YOUR FIRST PRIZE
 UP TO YOUR BEDROOM RIGHT NOW.
     YOU KNOW, AND AGAIN,
IT GOES BACK TO THE FACT THAT,
 YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT WASN'T
   LIKE A REAL EXPERIENCE--
     IF SOMEBODY HAD COME
       INTO MY BEDROOM,
   AND SOME CREEPY GUY WAS
WHISPERING TO ME EVERY NIGHT,
          YOU KNOW,
 MY PARENTS WOULD DEFINITELY
 HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT,
  BUT THE FARTHEST THEY WENT
   WAS KIND OF BEING LIKE,
"WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE HIM
   TO A PSYCHOLOGIST? NO."
 I WAS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP.
   I FELT THIS OVERWHELMING
    PRESSURE COME OVER ME.
 AND MY BREATHING JUST STOPPED.
      MY BODY WAS TRYING
      TO KIND OF TELL ME,
   "I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF NOW.
    AND YOU HAVE THE OPTION
        TO STOP THAT."
     IF I WANT TO CONTINUE
          TO BREATHE,
  I HAVE TO ACTIVELY OVERRIDE
  WHATEVER ELSE IS GOING ON.
      I HAVE TWO OPTIONS--
   EITHER TRY TO BREAK FREE
       OF THE PARALYSIS
          OR I BREATHE.
      YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
    KIND OF THE BEGINNING,
  AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING
    OF ME BEING AFRAID OF,
     NOT GOING TO SLEEP,
        BUT, YOU KNOW,
I WOULD JUST PRESSURE MYSELF,
   TO WAIT TILL EXHAUSTION
       TO FALL ASLEEP,
      FOR THE MOST PART,
      'CAUSE AFTER THAT,
    IT JUST NEVER STOPPED,
      UM... KIND OF EVER.
 I'LL GET IT
     JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE.
SOME PLACES WILL BE MUCH WORSE.
         AND THE VOICE
    IS DIFFERENT BY PLACE.
   UM... I HAD AN APARTMENT
          IN BOSTON.
   I LIVED IN JAMAICA PLAIN
    IN BOSTON FOR A WHILE
      ABOVE A PIZZA PLACE,
   AND I WOULD ALWAYS HEAR
    THIS MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
SINGING IN A BABY'S VOICE THERE,
   THIS GRADUALLY FADED AWAY
     UNTIL I PRETTY MUCH
        ALMOST FORGOT
   I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED IT.
 AND I... THOUGHT I WAS GOOD,
        FINALLY OVER.
     IT WAS JUST A PHASE
     I WAS GOING THROUGH,
       AND NOW IT'S DONE.
        ONE AFTERNOON,
  I WAS UP DOING HOUSEWORK,
     AND WAS KIND OF TIRED,
        AND I FIGURED
I'LL LAY DOWN AND TAKE A NAP,
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GO OUT WITH
SOME FRIENDS LATER ON TONIGHT.
     SO I WENT, LAID DOWN,
AND SET THE ALARM ON MY PHONE,
    CHECKED, SAW THE TIME,
   AND JUST KIND OF THREW IT
 ON THE NIGHTSTAND NEXT TO ME,
      AND JUST LAID DOWN.
            AND...
 AS I STARTED TO FALL ASLEEP,
 I FELT, LIKE, THIS TINGLING
   SENSATION COME OVER ME,
     AND SINCE I HAD BEEN
   DEALING WITH IT SO LONG,
     IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
     A FAMILIAR FEELING,
  IT WAS LIKE THE WARNING SIGN,
    "OKAY, SLEEP PARALYSIS
     IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN."
 LIKE, MY BODY WOULD TINGLE,
     START TO FEEL HEAVY.
        I'D SEE, LIKE,
 ALL THESE PIXILATED COLORS,
    AND SO I SET MYSELF UP
      TO WAKE MYSELF UP,
     KIND OF SHAKE IT OFF.
   SO THEN... IT FELT LIKE
        IT WENT AWAY.
       SO I JUST, LIKE,
     PICKED UP MY PHONE,
     LOOKED AT THE TIME,
     OKAY, LAID BACK DOWN
  AND STARTED GOING TO SLEEP.
  AND JUST AS I FELL ASLEEP,
        MY PHONE RANG.
-  AND SO I LAID THERE
         FOR A SECOND. 
 I WAS LIKE, "DO I ANSWER IT,
      DON'T I ANSWER IT?"
        JUST FELL ASLEEP,
      AND NOW SOMEBODY'S
         WAKING ME UP.
     SO FINALLY, I GAVE IN
      AND I ANSWERED IT.
      I GRABBED MY PHONE.
           "HELLO?"
        WHEN I DID THAT,
  THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END
  OF THE LINE SAID, "HELLO,"
   THEY SAID SOMETHING ELSE
  I COULDN'T REALLY MAKE OUT
  'CAUSE IT WAS ALL STATICKY
       AND CUTTING OUT.
          SO I SAID,
   "I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
      YOU'RE BREAKING UP.
  THERE'S A BAD CONNECTION."
    I SAID, "HELLO," AGAIN,
        AND I WAS LIKE,
     "YOU'RE BREAKING UP.
   I CAN'T, LIKE, HEAR YOU."
       AND SO, FINALLY I--
    TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHAT
 THEY WERE SAYING AND WHATNOT.
     AND I DECIDED I'M UP.
 I'M GONNA GO GET A CIGARETTE.
         SO, I GOT UP,
     JUST TALKING TO HIM,
    LIKE, "HELLO, HELLO?"
  AND THEN FINALLY I'D WALKED
   OUT INTO THE LIVING ROOM,
    AND JUST AS I GOT OUT
     IN THE LIVING ROOM,
          IT BECAME--
   THE CONNECTION CLEARED UP
AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END
 WAS THIS VERY PLEASANT MAN.
      HE WAS LIKE, "HELLO.
        I WAS WONDERING
 IF YOU COULD DO ME A FAVOR."
      WHAT KIND OF FAVOR?
 LET ME IN.
 I FREAKED OUT.
 I WAS, LIKE, THERE'S A DEMON
 ON THE OTHER END OF MY PHONE.
      I WANTED NOTHING TO
         DO WITH THIS.
      SO I THREW MY PHONE
        ACROSS THE ROOM
    AND IT BROKE INTO PIECES,
   THEN EVERYTHING AROUND ME
 JUST WENT INTO COMPLETE CHAOS.
       THEN JUST LIKE--
 ALMOST LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE HIT.
 LIKE, EVERYTHING WAS SHAKING
           AND DARK.
         MY WHOLE BODY
      STARTED VIBRATING.
         IT FELT LIKE
     SOMETHING WAS TRYING
   TO RIP ME OUT OF MYSELF,
 KIND OF LIKE PULL MY SOUL OUT.
           YOU KNOW,
 JUST TRYING TO PROCESS THIS,
    LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON,
           YOU KNOW,
   JUST ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED.
     AND SO THE ONLY THING
      I COULD THINK TO DO
   WAS I JUST STARTED PRAYING.
      I WAS, LIKE, "GOD,
   IF YOU'RE THERE, HELP ME.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.
         JUST, PLEASE,
      SOMEBODY HELP ME."
   AND AS SOON AS I SAID THAT,
     I FELT LIKE SOMEBODY
 JUST GRABBED ME FROM BEHIND,
 JUST, LIKE, YANKED ME BACK,
     LIKE, DOWN THE HALL,
       AND JUST, LIKE,
SLAMMED ME BACK INTO MY BODY.
   AND, LIKE, I HIT MY BODY,
AND I, LIKE, SAT UP INSTANTLY
  AND, LIKE, LOOKED AROUND,
        AND WAS LIKE,
    "DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?
        WAS THAT REAL?"
 AND SO THE FIRST THING I DID
 WAS GRAB MY PHONE, YOU KNOW.
I'M LIKE LOOKING THROUGH, "OKAY,
   WHO DID I JUST TALK TO?"
       AND, LIKE, NO--
  THERE WAS NO MISSED CALLS
OR NO ANSWERED CALLS OR NOTHING,
  AND I LOOKED AT THE TIME,
    AND IT HAD ONLY BEEN,
      LIKE, TWO MINUTES
 SINCE I INITIALLY LAID DOWN
       TO GO TO SLEEP.
     UM, I DID TELL MY MOM,
         AND SHE JUST
  KIND OF TOLD ME I'M NUTS.
SHE'S LIKE, "IT WAS A BAD DREAM.
  IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME."
          "NO, MOM.
     IT WASN'T A DREAM."
 I WAS IN SEVENTH
       OR EIGHTH GRADE,
        ABOUT '87 OR '88.
    AND I SAW "A NIGHTMARE
        ON ELM STREET"
        WITH MY MOTHER,
   THANK GOODNESS, ON CABLE.
       AND SHE WAS LIKE,
         "OH, MY GOSH!
   THIS IS LIKE OUR DREAMS,"
AND I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I KNOW."
    SO WE DEFINITELY AGREED
           ON THAT.
 AND I KEPT WATCHING IT BECAUSE
 I WANTED TO FIND SOME CLUES,
          SOME ANSWER
     TO WHAT WAS GOING ON.
  AND OF COURSE, THEY MENTION
     A LITTLE BIT OF MYTH
  IN THE MOVIE BUT NOT ENOUGH
      TO REALLY RESEARCH.
DID YOU EVER READ ABOUT
THE BALINESE WAY OF DREAMING?
                             NO.
THEY GOT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM
THEY CALL DREAM SKILLS.
    THEY GET ALL THEIR ART
 AND LITERATURE FROM DREAMS,
         JUST WAKE UP
      AND WRITE IT DOWN.
          DREAM SKILLS.
 WHAT IF THEY MADE A MONSTER
 IN THEIR DREAMS, THEN WHAT?
    WHEN I WAS-- YOU KNOW,
WE HAD HBO WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
 AND MY DAD WAS VERY LIBERAL
       WITH LETTING US
   WATCH WHATEVER WE WANTED
       TO WATCH ON HBO.
 ONCE HE WAS WATCHING A MOVIE,
AND I JUST KIND OF WANDERED IN.
     I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
      WHAT THE MOVIE WAS.
      AND THEN THIS, UH...
       CREATURE EMERGES
    FROM BEHIND A DRESSER.
        AND IT'S LIKE--
        IT'S AN ALIEN.
      AND IT'S LIKE THE--
 IT WAS THE MOVIE "COMMUNION,"
            WITH--
       WHAT'S HIS FACE?
            THE GUY
 WHO WAS IN THE DANCING VIDEO.
         I DON'T KNOW.
      CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.
        YEAH, EXACTLY.
      CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.
   AND WHEN I SAW THAT FACE...
   MY MIND IMMEDIATELY DREW
          A PARALLEL
TO THE THINGS I HAD EXPERIENCED
          AS A CHILD,
      AND I WAS PETRIFIED.
          I REMEMBER
     JUST BEING PETRIFIED.
             AND--
     AND THEN, YOU KNOW--
     BUT I STAYED WATCHING
  AS THIS, LIKE, LITTLE KID.
        AND, YOU KNOW,
    THESE IMAGES I REMEMBER
 AS INCREDIBLY SHOCKING IMAGES
      TO ME, AS A CHILD.
        BECAUSE IT WAS
        THE FIRST TIME
    THAT THE KIND OF THINGS
        THAT I HAD SEEN
  ALIGNED WITH SOMETHING THAT--
     THAT WAS KNOWN ABOUT
       OR WAS EXPLORED.
 A BUNCH OF PEOPLE CAME OVER,
      AND THEY'RE LIKE,
      "LET'S WATCH THIS
     'INSIDIOUS' MOVIE."
       AND I WAS LIKE,
    "YEAH, SURE, WHY NOT?
  I DON'T CARE," AND, LIKE--
ABOUT 20 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE,
 I'M LIKE, "THIS IS ABOUT SLEEP
 PARALYSIS, I'M PRETTY SURE."
    I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
     THAT'S KIND OF COOL.
         SOMEBODY MADE
   A HORROR MOVIE ABOUT IT."
       WHEN, YOU KNOW,
THE DUDE'S, LIKE, IN THE CHAIR,
HE JUST GOES INTO THIS WORLD,
AND HE'S SEARCHING FOR THE KID.
     THEY'RE PULLING FROM
    SO MANY DIFFERENT PARTS
    OF SLEEP PARALYSIS LORE.
         THE SHADOW MAN.
 I KEPT LEAVING MY BODY.
        THE NIGHT HAG.
         THE OLD HAG.
    I SAT THERE AND, LIKE,
JUST KIND OF GETTING ANNOYED.
           I MEAN,
    I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.
       IT WASN'T LIKE,
     "THIS MOVIE SUCKS!"
       I MEAN, IT WAS--
         IT WAS OKAY.
          AND THEN,
       ALL OF A SUDDEN,
        THEY DO, LIKE,
   THE HEAD SHAKING THING,
    LIKE THIS, LIKE, WEIRD--
 IT WAS IN "JACOB'S LADDER,"
    AND IT FREAKED ME OUT.
         I WAS LIKE,
"THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT FEELS."
 AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
           I EVER--
   I SAW SOMEBODY REPRESENT
     WHAT IT FEELS LIKE--
         OR I GUESS,
   NOT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE--
      WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
  IT LOOKS LIKE TO BE IN IT,
  LIKE WHEN I'M COMING OUT,
       LIKE, SOMETIMES
       MY JAW WILL, LIKE,
     JUST FUCKING GO BACK
     AND FORTH REAL QUICK,
 OR, LIKE, MY HEAD WILL SHOOT
      FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
    AND IT'S WHAT I IMAGINE
        IT LOOKS LIKE.
      EVEN MY GIRLFRIEND,
         SHE WAS LIKE,
          YOU KNOW,
 "THOSE WEIRD HEAD MOVEMENTS,
LIKE, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT'S
    LIKE FOR ME TO WATCH,
          YOU KNOW,
EXCEPT NOT MAGICALLY BLURRY."
 THAT'S THE SLEEP PARALYSIS.
     HEY, IT'S GOT TO BE.
 YEAH, I HAD MY OWN
   SLEEP PARALYSIS EPISODE,
    AND, WELL, IN THAT ONE,
 IT WAS SORT OF LIKE A CLASSIC
      THREE-DIMENSIONAL,
       BLACK SHADOW MAN,
   WHO CAME UP IN THE WOODS
       BEHIND MY HOUSE,
       LEANED OVER MY BED.
          AND I THINK
  MAYBE A YEAR OR TWO LATER,
  I SAW "NATURAL BORN KILLERS."
     AND THERE'S A SCENE,
AND IT GOES BY JUST IN A FLASH,
   WHERE THAT GUY IS, LIKE,
    IN THE OPENING CREDITS,
     COMING THROUGH, LIKE,
   THIS STRANGE RED TUNNEL,
      CLOUDY VORTEX THING.
 I THINK IT'S OVER THE CREDIT
 OF "PRODUCER ARNON MILCHAN."
 BUT IT WENT BY IN A FLASH,
     AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN
      KIND OF COMPLICATED
     TO CALL INTO EXISTENCE.
        SO I WAS LIKE,
     "WHY WAS THAT THERE?"
    AND I STILL DIDN'T KNOW
   WHAT SLEEP PARALYSIS WAS.
        I DIDN'T KNOW
 THAT ANYONE ELSE HAD HAD IT.
   SO I SAW THAT AND ALMOST
KIND OF TOOK IT AS A MESSAGE,
      LIKE, "THE PEOPLE
      WHO MADE THIS FILM
   HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE
         THAT I DID."
AND IT'S KIND OF
            LIKE A SIGNAL TO ME
                      IN SOME--
       SOME STRANGE, SCARY WAY.
 NO, IT'S TRUE.
IT WAS KIND OF THE SAME
AS A CHILD.
IT WAS VERY VALIDATING.
    I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS
MY MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON ME.
  I JUST KNEW SOMETHING BAD
 WAS ALWAYS HAPPENING TO ME.
   AND I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T
  KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.
  I'VE PRAYED MY WHOLE LIFE.
        I STILL PRAY.
  I'M A VERY SPIRITUAL PERSON.
           HOWEVER,
PRAYING NEVER MADE IT GO AWAY,
          EVEN WHEN
   I WAS WITHIN THE ATTACK.
I WOULD PRAY WITHIN THE ATTACK,
     AND STILL, NO HELP.
    I STARTED EXERCISING,
    STARTED EATING BETTER,
CUT BACK ON CAFFEINE AND DOING
   ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF,
      AND JUST NO MATTER
 WHAT I DID, THOUGH, IT WAS--
 IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT
   ON THE SLEEP PARALYSIS,
  AND IT JUST KEPT HAPPENING
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.
      I FINALLY DECIDED
 TO GO TO ONE OF THESE LADIES
       THAT READ CARDS,
        AND SHE SAYS,
 "I CAN'T LOOK INTO YOUR HOUSE.
      I'M TRYING TO LOOK
       INTO YOUR HOUSE,
          BUT I SEE
 THIS BLACK SHADOW OVER IT."
 I THOUGHT
   I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS
    FOR A LONG TIME, YEARS,
  YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS.
     BEFORE I WENT TO BED
         EVERY NIGHT,
     I WOULD LAY IN MY BED
       AND CLOSE MY EYES
        AND JUST PRAY,
  "NOT TONIGHT, NOT TONIGHT,
   NOT TONIGHT, NOT TONIGHT,
  NOT TONIGHT, NOT TONIGHT."
AND I WOULD JUST REPEAT IT OVER
 AND OVER AND OVER IN MY HEAD,
       AS IF I HAD SOME
     KIND OF PSYCHIC BOND
 WITH MY ALIEN ABDUCTORS
 AND THAT I COULD COMMUNICATE
   WITH THEM TELEPATHICALLY,
   AND JUST PLEAD WITH THEM,
 TO MAKE TONIGHT NOT THE NIGHT
   THAT THEY WOULD COME BACK
      AND DO THAT TO ME.
 OVER THE YEARS,
         I WOULD FIND
     DIFFERENT MECHANISMS
   TO AVOID SLEEP PARALYSIS.
  I NOTICED THAT IT WOULDN'T
      HAPPEN EVERY NIGHT
    IF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS
           WERE MET,
       LIKE, IF I WOULD--
  LIKE, THERE WOULD BE, LIKE,
       A TV IN MY ROOM.
     AND IF I LEFT IT ON,
        FOR SOME REASON
   IT WAS EASIER FOR ME NOT
 TO GET HIT BY THE PARALYSIS.
        AND, YOU KNOW,
  YOUNGER ME THOUGHT IT WAS
      MAYBE THAT LITTLE
     HIGH-PITCHED NOISE,
           TVs MAKE
   WHEN YOU LEAVE THEM ON,
    SO I WOULD LEAVE IT ON
      OVERNIGHT ON MUTE
       FOR THAT LITTLE
     HIGH-PITCHED NOISE.
   EVENTUALLY, THAT STOPPED
  WORKING AFTER ABOUT A YEAR.
         SO I DECIDED,
     LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
       IF ONE TV WORKED,
       WHAT ABOUT TWO?"
  AND I USED TO COLLECT JUNK,
 SO TVs, LIKE, WERE PLENTIFUL.
        AND TWO WORKED
      FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
     AND I JUST ESCALATED
    WITH THAT FOR A WHILE,
   'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SMART,
          APPARENTLY.
   NO, IT MADE ME LOOK LIKE
 A CRAZY PERSON UNTIL ONE DAY,
        I REALIZED THAT
  EVEN IF THIS WAS A PROBLEM,
 THIS WAS NOT A FUNCTIONAL WAY
  OF, LIKE, DEALING WITH IT.
SO I JUST REMOVED ALL THE TVs
 AT THAT POINT FROM MY ROOM,
  AND, YOU KNOW, ALL IT DID
         WAS LEAVE ME
WITH A MUCH STRONGER AND MORE
  ELABORATE SLEEP PARALYSIS.
 AND THAT'S KIND OF THE THING
      THAT I'VE REALIZED
  IS IF YOU HAVE IT EVERY DAY
AND YOU HAVE MULTIPLE EPISODES
            A DAY,
    IT WILL KIND OF LEARN
     HOW TO ADAPT TO YOU.
  LIKE, IF YOU TRY TO, LIKE,
 AVOID IT, IT WILL FIND YOU,
  AND IT WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN
           SOMEHOW.
       AND ANOTHER TIME,
      I ACTUALLY FELT IT
        GO ON THE BED.
    YOU KNOW, IT WAS AS IF
      IT'S CLIMBING UP.
     I WAS LAYING THERE,
      AND IT CAME HERE.
     I JUST CLOSED MY EYES.
    AND IT WAS ON TOP OF ME,
          AND IT WAS--
       IT'S LIKE I WAS
 HAVING SEX WITH THIS THING.
   AND I SAID, "OH, MY GOD,
     THIS CAN'T BE REAL.
      THIS CAN'T BE REAL."
     THIS DEMONIC THING,
      AND I DON'T KNOW,
     WHY AM I FEELING THIS?
WHAT ELSE IS GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?
       BUT IT HAPPENED.
 DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?
    I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
   IT WAS JUST THE FEELING.
  AND THEN IT WAS GONE AGAIN.
       A LOT OF FIRSTS
  ALL HAPPENED IN ONE NIGHT.
        WHEN THE PAIN
      STARTED HAPPENING,
      THE HALLUCINATIONS
       GOT MORE VIVID,
   AND I STARTED TO BE ABLE
    TO BE INTERACTED WITH.
  AND I GO DIRECTLY INTO THIS
 VERY, YOU KNOW, LUCID DREAM.
  I REMEMBER THE ARCHITECTURE
        OF THIS WORLD,
        OF THIS DREAM,
   IT WAS JUST VERY ANGULAR,
         AND I'M JUST
    KIND OF WALKING ON IT.
   THERE WERE, LIKE, STAIRS
   THAT WENT DOWN TO PLACES
 THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
   OUT A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
    AS I WAS WALKING AROUND,
       I REMEMBER A KID
    THAT I WAS FRIENDS WITH
          GROWING UP
     IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
        MY ONLY FRIEND
    FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
        COMES UP TO ME,
    AND HIS NAME WAS DANNY.
        AND BEHIND HIM
     IS THIS GIGANTIC DUDE
       WITH REALLY CRAZY
         ORANGE HAIR.
 AND DANNY SAYS, "THIS IS HIM.
        CAN I GO NOW?"
      AND HE JUST LEAVES
       THE GUY WITH ME.
        AND HE REPEATS,
     "YOU KNOW WHO I AM."
   I START THINKING OF LIKE,
  I DON'T KNOW YOU, I DON'T.
    I START LISTING PLACES.
  "DO I KNOW YOU FROM SCHOOL?
        "DO I KNOW YOU
       FROM McDONALD'S?"
     'CAUSE I USED TO WORK
        AT McDONALD'S.
    "DO I REMEMBER YOU FROM
    THE COMIC BOOK DEPOT?"
 WHICH WAS MY COMIC BOOK STORE.
   AND HE JUST KEEPS ON GOING,
 "NO. BUT YOU KNOW WHO I AM."
        ONE LAST TIME.
   AND THEN THE ENTIRE WORLD
       JUST DISAPPEARS,
   AND I'M IN THE STRONGEST
    SLEEP-PARALYSIS EPISODE
    I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.
      LIKE, I CANNOT MOVE.
      LIKE, I CAN'T EVEN
 TRY TO FORCE MYSELF OUT OF IT.
 LIKE, THAT LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM
        I GET SOMETIMES
       JUST WASN'T THERE.
       AND IT FELT LIKE
 I WAS COMPLETELY CONSTRAINED,
        YOU KNOW, FULLY,
      TO THE POINT WHERE
  I'M JUST TRYING TO BREATHE,
     BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
       WHAT ELSE TO DO.
    IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT
         DREAM DROPS,
    AND EVERYTHING'S GONE,
   HE KIND OF FIZZLES AWAY.
    AND THIS WAS THE FIRST
     EXPERIENCE WITH PAIN.
    IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE IT,
         PICTURE LIKE
     A CLAW-MACHINE GAME.
       YOU KNOW, THREE--
     THREE LITTLE THINGS.
         AND THAT'S
WHEN THE PAIN STARTS COMING.
    THE WORST ONE IS WHEN
     IT'S AROUND, LIKE,
          YOU KNOW,
      MY FUCKING DICK.
   AND I STILL FELT THE PAIN
       AFTER I WOKE UP.
         I DID NOT GO
   BACK TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT,
          I REMEMBER,
   AND I THINK I JUST PLAYED
          VIDEO GAMES
       UNTIL THE MORNING
    AND KIND OF QUESTIONED
         MY EXISTENCE.
     LIKE, I JUST REMEMBER
          BEING LIKE,
  "AND THIS IS DIFFERENT NOW,
       AND NOW IT HURTS,
        AND NOW THERE'S
    A DUDE TALKING TO ME."
         AND, LIKE, I--
THAT WAS KIND OF WHEN I STARTED
    TO FEEL A LITTLE CRAZY.
 LIKE, I STARTED TO FEEL LIKE
SOMETHING WAS DEFINITELY WRONG.
          WAS IT ME?
            MAYBE.
WAS IT SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL?
            MAYBE.
    I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED
      BEING AN ATHEIST.
        AND SOMETIMES
THEY'RE VERY, UM... ARTICULATE,
      LIKE THAT ONE WAS
   WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY,
     AND THEY'LL BE LIKE,
   "OH, I CAN TALK TO YOU,
    AND I KNOW YOUR NAME,"
      AND THIS AND THAT.
 AND SOMETIMES, THEY'RE JUST,
    LIKE, GOBBLEDYGOOKING,
   JUST, "BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,"
     LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE
THE CAPABILITY TO SPEAK ANYMORE.
     WHEN I WAS OLDER AND
   I WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE
     AND WAS STAYING THERE--
        I MEAN, I HATED
   GOING BACK TO THAT HOUSE.
     YOU KNOW, I HAD OTHER
    BAD EXPERIENCES THERE,
AND SO I HATED GOING BACK THERE.
   I HATED SLEEPING THERE.
      I WOULD USUALLY--
IF I GO BACK THERE AND VISIT,
        I LEAVE THE TV ON
    BECAUSE IT'S JUST SUCH
    AN OVERWHELMING FORCE.
      SO I FELL ASLEEP,
  AND I HAD THIS NIGHTMARE.
      AND THEN I WOKE UP,
      AND THEN I WOKE UP
    IN A SLEEP PARALYSIS.
        AND I WAS LIKE,
     "OH, HMM," YOU KNOW?
     BUT I WAS SO PUT OFF
         BY THE DREAM
   THAT I WASN'T IMMEDIATELY
     SHOCKED BY THE STATE
      OF SLEEP PARALYSIS,
WHICH NORMALLY IS WHAT IT DOES.
   AND I CAN KIND OF SEE IT
 OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYES,
     THAT THERE WAS THIS MAN
         STANDING DOWN
     AT THE END OF MY BED,
         KIND OF LIKE
    THIS SCHLUMPY OLD MAN.
       THAT'S TOO YOUNG
       FOR SOME REASON.
    MAYBE IT'S HIS POSTURE.
        AND I'M LIKE,
 "HUH," LIKE, "THAT'S WEIRD."
      SO I'M LYING THERE,
     AND THERE'S THIS MAN
  DOWN AT THE END OF THE BED,
      AND HE SAYS TO ME,
      HE SAYS, "FORREST...
    YOU JUST CAME ALL OVER
    YOUR MOTHER'S SHEETS."
YOU JUST MASTURBATED ALL OVER
  YOUR MOTHER'S BED SHEETS.
      YOU'RE DISGUSTING!
          A PERVERT.
  AND I HAD NOT MASTURBATED
   THAT NIGHT, I WILL SAY.
BUT HIS VOICE
  WAS IMMEDIATELY FAMILIAR.
   AS THE VOICE THAT TALKED
       TO ME AS A CHILD.
        THE SAME VOICE.
         IT WAS LIKE--
      IT WAS LIKE AS IF,
          YOU KNOW,
     YOU GET A PHONE CALL
       FROM A RELATIVE
   OR SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T
    TALKED TO IN A WHILE,
    RUN INTO AN OLD FRIEND
 AND HEAR THEIR VOICE FIRST,
  AND YOU RECOGNIZE THE VOICE.
     YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT
       FOR A LONG TIME.
       BUT YOU KNOW IT.
       IT'S THAT PERSON.
  AND I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE,
           I'M LIKE,
     "OH, IT'S THAT VOICE.
          THAT MAN."
 I'VE SEEN HIM
    TWO OR THREE MORE TIMES
  IN THAT PHYSICAL INCARNATION.
   BUT I'VE ALSO HAD, LIKE,
 TIMES WHERE I'VE SEEN PEOPLE,
    THAT HAVE APPROACHED ME
         THE SAME WAY
      AND I'VE FELT LIKE,
      "YES, THAT'S HIM."
           LIKE, I--
   IT WAS A DIFFERENT BODY,
  BUT IT WAS THAT SAME ENTITY
    THAT WAS TALKING TO ME.
 WE HAD A FRIEND STAYING OVER.
 WE HAD PEOPLE OVER THAT NIGHT,
   AND WE HAD A ONE-BEDROOM
       TINY APARTMENT.
         SO WE'RE ALL
 KIND OF CRAMMED INTO MY BED.
    AND I REMEMBER I HAD...
       UM, GONE TO SLEEP.
   YOU KNOW, THE TWO GIRLS,
       THEY WERE ASLEEP.
           YOU KNOW,
  THEY WERE OUT LIKE A LIGHT.
      ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,
      THE PARALYSIS HITS.
       NORMAL PARALYSIS.
      COMPLETELY NORMAL.
  YOU KNOW, SITUATION, LIKE,
   STEREOTYPICAL DARK ROOM,
         BUT IN THIS,
 THERE'S A REALLY TALL ENTITY,
 LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF THE ROOM'S
       EIGHT FEET TALL,
 HE IS AN EIGHT-FOOT-TALL DUDE
         WITH A HUNCH.
    LIKE, HE IS NOT FITTING
         IN THIS ROOM.
    AND THEY WERE RED EYES.
   THIS IS WHAT I REMEMBER.
  AND VERY MOTHMAN TYPE SHIT,
           ACTUALLY.
  AND IT STARTS TALKING TO ME.
          HE REPEATS,
     "YOU KNOW WHO I AM."
 YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
 YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.
 RIGHT NOW,
        BUT I KNOW YOU.
        AND YOU KNOW ME.
            YOU...
      ARE GOING TO DIE.
          I JUST HAD
  THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,
        YOU KNOW, AND,
   YOU KNOW, I BELIEVED IT.
  I BELIEVED THAT THIS THING
        WAS TELLING ME
     IT WAS GONNA KILL ME.
       I'M GOING TO DIE.
     AND I'M SITTING HERE
     FEELING BAD FOR HER
   THAT SHE'S FREAKING OUT,
AND I'M TRYING TO CALM HER DOWN.
 I FIGURE OUT SHE HAS THIS--
I FIGURED SHE HAD A SLEEP TERROR
   OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
     AND SHE'S TELLING ME
      THAT ON HER CHEST,
SHE SAW SOMETHING ON HER CHEST,
     A CAT WITH RED EYES,
   AND IT WAS LOOKING AT ME
   AND TALKING IN A LANGUAGE
 THAT SHE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
  LIKE, IT WAS ON TOP OF HER
      BUT THREATENING ME.
  AND THE SECOND SHE SAID IT
         HAD RED EYES,
  I JUST, LIKED, FREAKED OUT.
      LIKE, I WAS JUST--
          I, LIKE--
  I REMEMBER THIS WAS DURING
      A TIME OF MY LIFE
      WHERE I WAS LIKE,
"MAYBE I AM CRAZY. IT'S FINE."
    AND THEN THIS HAPPENED.
AND THEN IT IMMEDIATELY AFFIRMED
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE DEAD.
      LIKE, I WAS LIKE,
   "OH, I'M GOING TO DIE."
  AND, LIKE, SHIT LIKE THAT
     IMMEDIATELY MAKES ME
       WANT TO BE LIKE,
 "FUCK, LIKE, REGULAR LIFE."
            LIKE--
  SORRY ABOUT THE LANGUAGE.
 WHEN THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN,
        IT'S VERY HARD
      FOR ME TO BE LIKE,
   "YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA GO
       GET A NORMAL JOB
   AND, LIKE, LIVE MY LIFE."
       LIKE, I'M LIKE,
 "I WANT TO FIGURE THIS OUT."
 ANY IDEA
     WHY IT HAPPENS TO YOU
     MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE?
        I HAVE NO IDEA.
  I MEAN, I GUESS, YOU KNOW,
    IT'S ALL PRESUMPTION,
        BUT, YOU KNOW,
       YOU COULD ASSUME
  THAT MAYBE IT HAD SOMETHING
             TO DO
 WITH BEING SUCH A YOUNG CHILD,
     YOU KNOW, AND HAVING
  SUCH A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE.
  YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE
    WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING
      FOR THE FIRST TIME,
     YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.
 YOU KNOW, YOU GO TO SEA WORLD
    AND SEE A KILLER WHALE,
          AND YOU'VE
     NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE,
       AND NOW YOU KNOW
    WHAT A KILLER WHALE IS.
 I READ THE VERY FEW
 WEBSITES OUT THERE ABOUT IT,
   AND I DIDN'T REALLY LEARN
         ANYTHING NEW,
          EXCEPT FOR,
     THERE IS A CHEMICAL,
          MELATONIN,
  THAT GOES INTO YOUR SYSTEM,
   AND IS RELEASED UPON SLEEP
        THAT'S SUPPOSED
       TO PARALYZE YOU.
    AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY,
 MAYBE THIS COULD BE MEDICAL."
          BUT AGAIN,
 THERE WAS NEVER AN EXPLANATION
       FOR THE SHADOW MAN
     EXCEPT FOR HYPNAGOGIC
        HALLUCINATIONS,
      WHICH IS A NICE WORD
       THAT THE DOCTORS
     LIKE TO THROW AROUND,
      BUT IT REALLY MEANS
     YOU JUST IMAGINED IT.
 MY GUESS IS WE CONCEPTUALIZE
  THINGS IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS,
       BASED ON, LIKE,
   SNIPPETS OF INFORMATION
      THAT WE PICKED UP
   ALONG THE ROAD SOMEHOW.
        IF I CAME FROM
   AN EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY
  WHERE THEY REALLY BELIEVED
       IN EVIL DEMONS,
MAYBE MY IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION
     FROM MY UNCONSCIOUS
 AS I'M RISING OUT OF SLEEP,
     WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE,
  "OH, SHIT, IT'S THE DEVIL!"
 YEAH, THAT'S INTERESTING.
 ALTHOUGH, I WONDER IF YOU LOOK
     AT YOUR OWN REACTION
            TO YOUR EXPERIENCES
           AS SIMILAR IN A WAY.
YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
LIKE, THAT'S TRUE.
OF COURSE. LIKE,
ALSO MY UNCONSCIOUS IS LIKE,
"WHAT IS THE SCIENTIFIC
EXPLANATION FOR THIS?
THERE MUST BE A REASON
THAT HAS TO DO WITH LOGIC."
SO, YEAH, OF COURSE
I LEAPT FOR THAT, TOO.
 I CAN SEE IT JUST AS EASILY
   THERE'S THE COMMONALITY
  OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE, LIKE,
HOW OUR BRAINS AND OUR HEARTS
AND OUR PERSONALITIES FUNCTION,
   LIKE, WE'RE ALL PEOPLE.
     WHY WOULDN'T WE SEE
       SIMILAR THINGS?
            LIKE,
 WE'RE NOT DIFFERENT SPECIES.
 WHY WOULDN'T WE HAVE SIMILAR
GO-TO ARCHETYPES IN OUR BRAIN?
          SO JUNGIAN.
    BUT IT CAN'T ENTIRELY
      BE BORN FROM YOU.
   YOU KNOW, THAT'S TO SAY
  THAT EVERYBODY HAS IN THEM
THE CAPABILITY OF BRINGING OUT
    THESE HORRIBLE THINGS
BEFORE THEY'VE EVEN WITNESSED
      ANYTHING HORRIBLE.
    IT'S ONE OF MY THEORIES,
     THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY
      RUNNING OUR BRAIN,
 WE'RE KIND OF OVERCLOCKING IT,
 YOU KNOW, MORE THAN WE WOULD
   WHEN WE'RE JUST SLEEPING
        OR JUST AWAKE.
  AND THAT KIND OF HEIGHTENED
     SENSE OF PERCEPTION,
    WHILE WE AS HUMANS...
        CAN'T REALLY--
     WE CAN'T INTERPRET IT.
LIKE, WE'RE STILL NOT, YOU KNOW,
    INTERPRETING IT RIGHT,
     BUT NOW WE'RE SEEING
        THE RAW DATA.
   WE'RE SEEING, YOU KNOW,
 "OH, THAT COULD BE A DEMON."
       I DON'T KNOW HOW
    TO VISUALIZE A DEMON,
  BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A THING
 THAT MY BRAIN CAN INTERPRET.
 AND, I MEAN,
  I ACTUALLY KIND OF BELIEVE
 THAT PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE
        WHO DO BELIEVE
 THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED,
     WERE ACTUALLY VICTIMS
      OF SLEEP PARALYSIS
      OF VARYING DEGREES.
  AND OF COURSE, READING MORE
    ABOUT SLEEP PARALYSIS,
 AND REALIZING THE PREVALENCE
      OF THIS EXPERIENCE,
   YOU KNOW, EXISTS IN EVERY
 SINGLE CULTURE IN THE WORLD.
    THERE ARE THESE COMMON
ARCHETYPES THAT KEEP POPPING UP,
    AND ALL OVER THE WORLD.
             LIKE,
   IT'S NOT JUST IN AMERICA
          PEOPLE GET
    THESE RED-EYED DEMONS.
        AND IT'S NOT--
 YOU KNOW, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
           YOU KNOW,
       THE SHADOW MAN...
     THE CATS ON THE CHEST.
 A GIANT CAT THAT WOULD
  COME INTO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE
   WHILE THEY WERE SLEEPING,
       HOLD THEM DOWN--
      IT'S LIKE CLAWED--
     LIKE TEETH AND CLAWS.
        SOMETIMES METAL
      OR LIKE METAL-ISH.
   YEAH, THERE ARE THE ONES
          IN TURKEY.
   THERE'S THE ANCIENT MORSE--
    THE ANCIENT NORSE ONE,
        LIKE, THE MARE.
  AND THERE ARE JUST SO MANY.
 THE HAINT, LIKE "THE HAUNT."
 THE HMONG IMMIGRANTS.
         SUBSEQUENTLY,
      A LOT OF THEM DIED,
           YOU KNOW,
     FROM SLEEP PARALYSIS.
 RIGHT, RIGHT,
     AND I KNOW WES CRAVEN
   READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT THEM,
        AND THAT HELPED INSPIRE
    "A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET"
     AND FREDDY KRUEGER, WHICH,
         YOU KNOW, THEN WENT ON
           TO CREATE
    A WEIRD FEEDBACK LOOP,
   INSPIRING OTHER PEOPLE'S
          NIGHTMARES
      AND SLEEP PARALYSIS
         EXPERIENCES.
 SO I HAD A DREAM
     ABOUT FREDDY KRUEGER,
    AND HE OBVIOUSLY WANTED
          TO KILL ME,
       WANTED TO HARM ME,
        WANTED TO SCARE
      THE CRAP OUT OF ME,
        AND I BELIEVE
      THAT THAT FEAR...
      CREATES A SUBSTANCE,
   AND I GOT THIS BLACK INK
       SCARED OUT OF ME,
        LIKE AN INK FISH.
         AND I BELIEVE
     THAT'S WHAT IT EATS.
 THE PHYSICIST
     MICHIO KAKU SAID THAT
   MAYBE THAT WE DON'T LIVE
    IN JUST ONE DIMENSION,
         THAT WE LIVE
    IN MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS.
      AND IF YOU IMAGINE
       A BLOCK OF FLATS
 THAT AS AN INFINITE EXTENSION
         OF YOURSELF,
      SO IT KEEPS ADDING
    TO ITSELF ALL THE TIME
       AND NEVER STOPS,
       AND IN EVERY ROOM
     OF THIS BLOCK OF FLATS,
     IS AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE
          LIKE OURS.
             NOW,
     IN EVERY OTHER ROOM,
         THERE MUST BE
       ANOTHER UNIVERSE.
       SO, IF THAT'S TRUE,
       MAYBE SOME OTHER US
      HAVE FOUND OUR WAY
       INTO THE HALLWAY,
       AND ARE KNOCKING
         ON OUR DOOR.
 READY, TWO.
   RIGHT AFTER MY MOM DIED,
    I WAS VERY DEPRESSED.
     AND SO I'D BE CRYING.
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS THIS ONE DAY
          I REMEMBER
   THAT I HAD A BREAKDOWN,
AND I WAS CRYING A LOT, A LOT.
    AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,
  SINCE I WORK NIGHT SHIFT,
     I CAME HOME, SLEPT--
     YOU KNOW, TO SLEEP.
   AND THEN FOR SOME REASON
           THAT DAY,
  I WANTED TO SLEEP ON MY SIDE.
     SO I SLEPT ON MY SIDE
FACING THE DOOR OF THE BEDROOM.
     AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
 I FELT MY BODY GETTING NUMB.
  I FELT IT GETTING PARALYZED.
   AND I SAID, "OH, MY GOD.
   I'M GETTING THIS AGAIN."
   BUT THEN IT FELT DIFFERENT.
    I HEARD SOMEBODY WALKING.
   THIS PRESENCE CAME AROUND.
    AND IT CAME BEHIND ME.
       I WAS LIKE THIS.
      IT CAME BEHIND ME,
      AND IT HUGGED ME.
   AND I HEARD THE MATTRESS
         DEPRESS ALSO.
    I HEARD THAT DEPRESS,
LIKE SOMEONE WENT IN THE BED.
 AND I FELT IT WAS MY MOTHER,
    AND I HEARD HER VOICE,
         AND SHE SAYS,
 "HONEY, I'M HERE. I'M HERE."
   AND IT FELT SO DIFFERENT
   FROM THAT PAST PRESENCE,
      BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
     THIS WAS MY MOTHER.
      IT DIDN'T FEEL EVIL.
        IT FELT WARM,
       AND I WAS HAPPY.
    AND I WOULD TALK TO HER.
         IT'S LIKE--
   THROUGH MY MIND I SAID,
    "OH, MOMMY, IT'S YOU.
         OH, MY GOD."
  AND SHE'S HUGGING ME TIGHT
SAYING, "I'M HERE, I'M HERE."
      AND THAT WAS JUST
     A MATTER OF SECONDS,
       ALL OF A SUDDEN,
        SHE WAS GONE.
        SO I REALLY--
          YOU KNOW,
     I THINK IT'S MY MOM
   THAT COMES TO VISIT US.
 DOES THAT STILL HAPPEN?
 IT HAPPENED, LIKE,
      TWO OR THREE TIMES.
     BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
       I FEEL IT'S HER,
     THERE'S A PART OF ME
     THAT SOMETIMES SAYS,
   "WHAT IF IT'S THIS THING?"
       BECAUSE SOMETIMES
     WHEN I HAVE FELT HER,
       ALL OF A SUDDEN,
   THEN IT KIND OF SWITCHES,
   AND THEN I DO FEEL, LIKE,
 IF THERE'S ANOTHER PRESENCE.
     AND THEN I DON'T KNOW
   IF IT'S THIS THING AGAIN
     THAT USED TO HAUNT ME
           BACK THEN
  OR IF IT IS STILL HER EVEN
 THOUGH IT DOES FEEL DIFFERENT.
   I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE
       IN BOTH OF THEM,
       AND I HAVE SAID,
        "WHO ARE YOU?"
        BUT OF COURSE,
    I DON'T GET AN ANSWER.
    AND THEN IT JUST LASTS
      FOR A FEW SECONDS,
         AND IT'S GONE.
   THE ONE THAT STANDS OUT
      ABOVE ALL OTHERS,
     IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT
  WHEN ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND
         WENT TO BED,
   AND IT WAS AROUND 10:00,
  AND I WASN'T REALLY TIRED.
    SO I PLAYED ON MY PHONE
          FOR A BIT,
      A GAME ON THE PHONE,
 AND I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP.
        WHEN I WOKE UP,
 I STOOD AT THE SIDE OF MY BED,
     IN A VERY OPPRESSIVE
         ATMOSPHERE.
       I CAN'T DESCRIBE
    THE ATMOSPHERE TO YOU,
     UNLESS YOU WERE THERE.
      I MEAN, I'VE NEVER
    EXPERIENCED IT BEFORE
AND I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED IT
       AGAIN LIKE THAT.
        IT'S A KIND OF
      A VERY STATICKY...
   UH, JUST PRESENCE OF EVIL.
  AND AS I TURNED TO MY LEFT,
  I SEE MY GIRLFRIEND IN BED,
     AND I SEE ME IN BED.
     AND NOW I'M CONFUSED,
 BUT I ALSO SEE MY EYES OPEN,
    AND THEN I HEARD MYSELF
      LABORED BREATHING,
 WHICH IS WHAT I DO WHEN I HAVE
   A SLEEP PARALYSIS ATTACK.
  I'M SHOCKED, SCARED, AND...
        I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
         I'M CONFUSED
     MORE THAN ANYTHING.
          I CAN'T--
   I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
    AND ALMOST INSTANTLY,
    AS I'M THINKING THAT,
    I CAN SEE THREE BEINGS
OVER IN THIS CORNER OF THE ROOM.
          THERE'S NO
    LOOKING ME UP AND DOWN
     AND SEEING WHO I AM
  AND WHAT I'M DOING THERE.
            THEY--
 THE TWO GENERIC SHADOW PEOPLE,
      THEY ADVANCE ON ME
         STRAIGHTAWAY.
       A GRAPPLE ENSUED
     BETWEEN ME AND THEM.
       I'D LIKE TO SAY
    IT WAS A NOBLE FIGHT,
     THAT I HAD TO REALLY
  PUT MY FOOT DOWN AND WIN,
         BUT IT WASN'T.
      THEY JUST RETREATED
         STRAIGHTAWAY
   WHEN I PUT RESISTANCE UP
      BEHIND THE HAT MAN.
 AND THE HAT MAN SHIELDED THEM.
    AND I HAD NO INTENTION
       OF GOING FORWARD
    TO INVESTIGATE ANY MORE.
      ALL I KNOW IS THAT
  I HAVE TO GET BACK IN BED,
     THAT SOME SORT OF--
 SOME VOICE IN MY HEAD SAYING
   AND MY OWN VOICE SAYING,
      "GET BACK IN BED."
       AND AS I TURNED,
I CAN SEE A LONG SILVER THREAD,
  FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD,
 THAT'S GOING TOWARDS MY BODY.
 AND I DECIDE THAT NOW I HAVE
   GOTTA GET BACK INTO BED.
  AND JUST AS I DECIDE THAT,
      I SHOOT UP IN BED.
     THERE'S NO IN BETWEEN,
     GOING BACK IN MY BODY
         OR WHATEVER.
      IT'S JUST I'M THERE.
      I SIT STRAIGHT UP,
     AND I GO DOWNSTAIRS
      INTO THE KITCHEN,
         GET A DRINK,
    AND I'M INSTANTLY HIT
    BY THE FEAR AND GUILT,
      THAT I'VE LEFT HER
     ON HER OWN UPSTAIRS.
    BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL
        IN THAT ROOM.
     I KNOW THEY'RE STILL
         IN THAT ROOM.
  AND AS I GO BACK UPSTAIRS,
        I SIT IN BED,
    AND I STAY UP ALL NIGHT.
   AND IT'S LIKE I'M ON WATCH.
THEY JUST WANTED ME REALLY BAD.
     I REMEMBER I WAS JUST
   SORT OF LAYING IN MY BED,
     AND THEN THERE'S NOW
        THE LOUD NOISE,
  AND, OH, I HATE THE SOUND
        OF THE NOISE.
   IT'S, LIKE, ALMOST LIKE
      SPIRITS OR DEMONS,
      LIKE, KIND OF LIKE
      SCREAMING AT YOU.
- - SO THEN YOU HEAR, LIKE--
       IT'S ALMOST LIKE
    A BUZZING THAT STARTS,
     AND THEN I CAN SENSE
         A PRESENCE,
           RIGHT--
   LIKE, STANDING OVER ME.
   JUST STANDING RIGHT HERE
          NEXT TO ME
          ON MY BED
      STANDING OVER ME.
     THEN YOU HEAR, LIKE,
         THIS SOUND.
         IT'S LIKE--
        IT FEELS LIKE
     SOMEBODY'S SCREAMING
      RIGHT IN YOUR EAR,
   LIKE THEY'RE RIGHT HERE,
    AND THEY'RE SCREAMING.
 AND I CAN SENSE THE COLOR RED,
   AS IF THEY WERE WEARING
        SOMETHING RED
   OR LIKE A DARK RED ROBE
      OR SOMETHING RED.
AND I TRIED TO LOOK AT THE FACE,
       BUT I COULDN'T.
      LIKE, EVERY INCH,
       EVERY CENTIMETER
     FEELS LIKE OVER A TON.
  AND SO I'M TRYING TO MOVE,
      AND I WANNA SEE IT,
       AND I'M LOOKING,
  LIKE STRAINING TO LOOK UP,
      STRAINING TO LOOK UP.
           I COULD--
 I COULD BARELY MOVE MY HEAD.
IT WAS ALMOST GOING LIKE THIS,
            LIKE--
       AND THEN, LIKE,
  I THINK I SAID SOMETHING.
         I JUST SAID,
    "I REMEMBER THIS GUY.
       HIS NAME IS JESUS,
  AND I'M GONNA USE HIS NAME
          RIGHT NOW.
      AND I'M GONNA SAY,
       'IN JESUS' NAME,
  YOU KNOW, GET OUT,'" OR--
I SAID SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.
            JESUS...
            JESUS...
       IN JESUS' NAME....
      IN JESUS' NAME...
           GET OUT.
    AND I SUDDENLY SENSED
       THAT THE DEMONS,
         OR THE THING
  THAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME,
      THAT EVIL PRESENCE
       JUST LEFT. GONE.
      AND IT WAS AMAZING.
    IT WAS LIKE A FEELING
      OF VICTORY, YEAH.
 AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK?
    THEY NEVER CAME BACK.
I WASN'T EVEN A CHRISTIAN THEN.
 I ACTUALLY ABHORRED RELIGION.
        I DIDN'T WANT--
    SOME LADY A LONG TIME
         AGO TOLD ME
I SHOULD MARRY A CHRISTIAN MAN,
AND I JUST LAUGHED IN HER FACE.
      ANYWAYS, I LEARNED
     VERY LATE IN MY LIFE
    THAT THE NAME OF JESUS
          HAS POWER,
        AND THAT'S HOW
    I BECAME A CHRISTIAN.
 SO DO YOU NOT--
       DO YOU BELIEVE IN
   THE WIKIPEDIA DEFINITION
       OF SLEEP PARALYSIS?
              NO.
      UM, THAT WOULD BE
      SORT OF LIKE THE--
        I GUESS, THE--
      THE WORLDLY TERM,
 LIKE, WHAT PEOPLE WOULD DEEM
         AS SOMETHING
THAT'S A PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE,
THAT IT'S LIKE A NATURAL THING
 THAT HAPPENS WITH THE BODY.
 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.
          I DO THINK
  THAT IT'S SOMETHING TO DO
   WITH THE SPIRITUAL REALM.
    AND IT'S CLOSELY TIED
WITH POSSIBLY DEMONIC ACTIVITY.
        AT 33 YEARS OLD,
 I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA GET
      ANY BETTER FOR ME.
     I'VE EXPERIENCED IT
       MOST OF MY LIFE,
      IF NOT ALL MY LIFE.
     I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.
     I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THIS IS JUST A RARE OCCURRENCE.
        I THINK IT'S--
 I THINK NONE OF US ARE SPECIAL
 THAT HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO THEM.
THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD
 HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO US, SO--
     BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW
     HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE
   OUT THERE EXPERIENCE THIS.
  I KNOW THERE ARE QUITE A FEW,
          BUT I THINK
      THERE'S A LOT MORE.
        HEY, EVERYBODY,
       IT'S CONNIE HERE,
     A.K.A. PHOENIXRISING11.
    THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
    I FIRST WANNA START OUT
        BY SAYING THAT,
     I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU
    A VERY PERSONAL STORY,
  AND IF YOU GET WEIRDED OUT
            EASILY
         OR YOU'RE NOT
      THAT OPEN-MINDED...
 SO YOU MADE A PRETTY
    POWERFUL YOUTUBE VIDEO
     ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE.
         DO YOU WATCH
    A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S
     SLEEP PARALYSIS VIDEOS?
 I DON'T REALLY
       LIKE TO LISTEN--
     I HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT
      OF OTHER PEOPLE'S
    SLEEP PARALYSIS VIDEOS.
       ALTHOUGH PEOPLE
   DO SEND ME THEIR STUFF,
    I JUST AM NOT IN A PLACE
      TO WANT TO LISTEN
TO THAT KIND OF STUFF ANYMORE.
       I DON'T KNOW WHY.
    I FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST--
   IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT'S
          THE PAST,
  AND I'M NOT IN THAT SPACE
           ANYMORE.
   YOU KNOW, I FOUND FAITH,
    AND I MET MY HUSBAND,
     AND I NEVER THOUGHT
   I'D GET MARRIED, AND...
 SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY
 TRYING NOT TO THINK TOO MUCH
 ABOUT SLEEP PARALYSIS ANYMORE.
   YEAH, YEAH, I MEAN, WHY?
     FOR WHAT, YOU KNOW?
             UM...
          I WAS, UH...
        DATING A GIRL
    WHO WAS PRETTY CRAZY.
 SHE WAS KIND OF REALLY INTO
     BEING VERY NATURE-Y.
      NOT LIKE A HIPPIE,
       BUT KIND OF LIKE
  A CRAZY WOOD SPIRIT NYMPH
    WAS KIND OF HER VIBE.
     A LOT OF HER CLOTHES
WERE, LIKE, STITCHED TOGETHER.
SHE WAS CRAZY.
  SHE WOULD DO THINGS LIKE,
    SAY, START WALKING OUT
         IN THE MIDDLE
 OF AN INCREDIBLY BUSY STREET,
 AND I WOULD TRY AND STOP HER,
      AND SHE'D BE LIKE,
           "NO, NO,
 THE SPIRITS ARE GUIDING ME,"
 WITH HER EYES CLOSED.
  I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE SURVIVED.
    SO SHE WAS DEFINITELY
  ON THE CUSP OF SOMETHING.
            SO WAS I.
  WE WERE BOTH REALLY LIVING
        IN THE FRINGES
     OF SANITY AT THAT TIME.
    AND WE WENT UP TO A CABIN
        THAT MY DAD HAS
 IN THE BAY OF FUNDY IN CANADA.
    AND WE WERE WALKING OUT
         IN THE WOODS.
   AND IT WAS GETTING DARK.
     IT WAS KIND OF DUSK.
         SO SHE SAID,
 "LET'S BUILD A STONE CIRCLE",
    BECAUSE WE'D JUST GONE
      TO A PEBBLE BEACH.
    SO WE TOOK OUR PEBBLES
    AND LAID THEM ALL DOWN.
      AND THEN WE DECIDED
       TO BE RECEPTIVE,
  IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
       AND SO SHE, LIKE,
        CLOSED HER EYES
      AND SHE WAS, LIKE,
      STANDING LIKE THIS,
    AND I WAS JUST KIND OF
   STANDING THERE LIKE THIS.
   - AND SUDDENLY SHE GOES,
  "OH, SOMETHING'S COMING." 
 - SHE'S COMING! SHE'S COMING!
  AND SHE HAD HER EYES CLOSED,
     AND SO SHE WAS NOT--
    COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING,
      AND I WAS LOOKING,
        AND IT WAS LIKE
       SHE WAS LISTENING
      AND I WAS LOOKING.
 AND I LOOKED INTO THE FOREST,
          AND, UM...
    OUT CAME THIS BLUE FORM.
    IT STARTED APPROACHING,
  THIS VERY, VERY BLUE THING.
 LIKE, IT HAD THE SAME QUALITY
      AS THE BLACK THINGS
     THAT WE TALKED ABOUT,
      BUT BLUE, PEACEFUL,
    JUST REALLY, LIKE, NICE.
        AND SHE'S LIKE,
       "OH, SHE'S BLUE."
     SHE SAID, "SHE'S BLUE."
         EYES CLOSED,
     YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.
   AND IT CAME AND APPROACHED,
       AND THEN IT JUST
     KIND OF STOOD STILL,
    AND IT WAS MAYBE, LIKE,
     SIX FEET OVER THERE.
    I'M GETTING GOOSEBUMPS
   JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS.
   AND HERE'S MY GIRLFRIEND,
 AND SHE'S JUST LAUGHING A LOT,
    LIKE, "OH, SHE'S SAYING
     THE FUNNIEST THINGS."
       LIKE, JUST CRAZY.
 IT WAS REALLY CRAZY AND WEIRD.
       AND SHE GOES, "OH,
SHE SAYS NOT TO BE WORRIED
ABOUT THE DEMONS BEHIND YOU."
     AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"
      AND I TURNED AROUND.
         AND I SAW THEM.
        THAT SAME FACE.
   THE FACE THAT PEOPLE SEE
     WHEN THEY'RE ABDUCTED
          BY ALIENS.
      THE FACE THAT I SAW
       AS A SMALL CHILD.
    AND THEN IN THAT MOMENT,
  I SUDDENLY HAD THIS, LIKE,
     KIND OF REALIZATION.
    'CAUSE IT WASN'T, LIKE,
          LINGUISTIC.
     I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY
        TALKING TO ME,
     BUT I FELT A THOUGHT
          IN MY HEAD,
      SOMETHING EXTERNAL,
AND IT WAS ALL ABOUT HOW, UM...
    FEAR EMPOWERS BAD THINGS.
       TO HAVE FEAR WHEN
  YOU'RE IN A BAD ENVIRONMENT
        OR A BAD PLACE
     OR AROUND A BAD THING
     ONLY GIVES THAT THING
        MORE STRENGTH.
   WHAT THAT KIND OF MADE ME
       BEGIN TO REALIZE
      IS THAT, YOU KNOW,
 HERE I'M HEARING THESE VOICES,
   AND THEY'RE DISEMBODIED,
           CONFUSED,
     SCHIZOPHRENIC GHOSTS,
           YOU KNOW,
     YEAH, THOSE ARE PEOPLE.
      MAYBE THEY'RE DEAD.
     MAYBE THEY'RE ALIVE.
          I DON'T KNOW.
   BUT THEN THE OTHER THINGS,
   THE BLACK, CLOUDY THING,
      THESE GRAY THINGS,
    UM, THOSE ARE SOMETHING
         MORE PRIMAL,
      SOMETHING MORE JUST
        ENVIRONMENTAL.
        AND WHEN I CAME
 TO THAT REALIZATION, I'M LIKE,
         WELL, DOES IT
   HAVE TO BE ANY ONE THING?
   AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER,
       THE BLUE SPIRIT,
             UH,
  DISSIPATED INTO THE WOODS.
  AND THEN WE WENT BACK TO,
     YOU KNOW, THE CABIN,
       AND THAT WAS THAT.
 YOU'RE TALKING
 ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS
     AT THE ABSOLUTE EDGES
         OF DREAMING.
            LIKE,
  YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN DREAMS.
    YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THEM
          LOGICALLY.
   THEY'RE ALL LITTLE BITS
          AND PIECES
      THAT COME UP FROM
    YOUR UNCONSCIOUSNESS,
       AND FROM THINGS
     YOU'VE EXPERIENCED,
AND WHO KNOWS HOW THE SLEEPING
  MIND PUTS THINGS TOGETHER?
    AND NOW YOU'RE TALKING
     ABOUT AN EXPERIENCE
         THAT HAPPENS
  IN THAT IN-BETWEEN STAGE.
        IT'S SO LIMINAL.
     YOU CAN'T PUT LOGIC
   ONTO LIMINAL SITUATIONS.
          I NEED YOU
      TO ALSO UNDERSTAND
         THAT I WAS IN
     AN ABUSIVE HOUSEHOLD.
    I BELIEVE BECAUSE I WAS
 BEATEN SO MUCH DURING THE DAY,
        THAT AT NIGHT,
      MY SOUL HAD TO HEAL
        TO KEEP ME HERE.
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GET THROUGH
     THE FOURTH DIMENSION,
  AND THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GO
 SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BE HEALED,
   SO THAT I COULD COME BACK
    AND DEAL WITH MY LIFE.
  I KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
    ABOUT SLEEP PARALYSIS
   UNTIL I WAS TOLD ABOUT IT.
AND THEN I, ALMOST INSTANTLY,
    BEGAN EXPERIENCING IT.
    I DON'T BELIEVE, LIKE,
THE MEDICAL EXPLANATION TO IT,
   THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STUFF,
    JUST A SLEEP DISORDER.
      THERE'S GOT TO BE
       WAY MORE TO IT.
I TOLD MY ONE FRIEND ABOUT IT
   WHEN I WAS JUST TALKING,
I WAS LIKE, "HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
     OF SLEEP PARALYSIS?"
      SHE'S LIKE, "NO,"
AND SO I SHARED MY EXPERIENCE.
    AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,
       SHE'S TEXTING ME.
   SHE'S LIKE, "I HATE YOU.
          I HATE YOU.
 WHATEVER YOU WERE TELLING ME
    ABOUT HAPPENING TO YOU,
       NOW IT'S STARTING
       TO HAPPEN TO ME."
     KIND OF LIKE AN STD,
 "SLEEP-TRANSMITTED DISEASE."
   THERE WAS AN EXPERIENCE
       DURING THIS TIME
       THAT I ACTUALLY
      DID THINK I DIED.
   WHOLE DREAM'S GOING FINE.
     I DON'T REALLY KNOW
      WHAT WE'RE DOING.
  IT'S ONE OF THOSE THREE-,
FOUR-DAY-FEELING TYPE DREAMS.
I'M JUST KIND OF EXISTING IN IT,
     SORT OF ENJOYING IT.
  AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, LIKE,
 SOMEBODY KNOCKS AT THE DOOR.
IT'S, LIKE, TWO HOMELESS DUDES.
 AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GET IN,
 AND I'M TRYING TO TELL THEM,
  "LISTEN, WE'RE AT CAPACITY.
WE'RE AT CAPACITY FOR HOMELESS
PEOPLE IN MY WEIRD DREAM TOWN."
 THERE'S A GUY ON ROLLER BLADES
 IN THE BACKGROUND, VERY '90s.
    AND I WASN'T THINKING,
     BUT HE, LIKE, TURNS,
         AND HE STARTS
  ROLLER-BLADING TOWARDS ME.
AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S AWESOME.
HE'S GONNA COME INTO PLAY HERE.
          THIS IS COOL.
I'M PROBABLY GONNA WAKE UP SOON
 'CAUSE IT'S ALL EVAPORATING."
 AND AS HE GETS REALLY CLOSE,
   HE JUST PULLS OUT A GUN.
         AND THEN I'M
       IN THE PARALYSIS.
   BUT IT'S NOT A PARALYSIS
    I'VE EVER FELT BEFORE.
      IT'S JUST NOTHING.
     I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
    I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.
       I'M JUST NOTHING.
       SO I GUESS MAYBE
     THIS IS AN AFTERLIFE.
        AND I WAS LIKE,
      "NAH, PROBABLY NOT.
      MAYBE I'M IN A COMA."
   AND I'M STARTING TO THINK
        SLEEP PARALYSIS
   PROBABLY FINALLY FUCKED ME.
    LIKE, I'M PROBABLY DONE.
   AND I'VE PROBABLY STOPPED
          BREATHING,
   AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
       WHEN IT HAPPENS,
             LIKE,
     I'M JUST NOTHINGNESS.
       AND, LIKE, FIVE,
      TEN MINUTES GO BY,
      AND I'M JUST LIKE--
     GET A LITTLE NERVOUS,
  BUT, LIKE, AT THE SAME TIME,
           I'M JUST
    KIND OF WEIRDLY SERENE.
       LIKE, "THIS SUCKS."
            AND...
     I REMEMBER THINKING,
      LIKE, I'M GONNA TRY
      TO PULL OUT OF IT.
             LIKE,
  THE SAME MOTION I WOULD DO
        TO PULL OUT OF
       SLEEP PARALYSIS,
      I'M GONNA JUST TRY
       TO EMULATE THAT.
    AND I TRY OVER AND OVER
        AND OVER AGAIN,
   I MEAN, HUNDREDS OF TIMES.
       YOU KNOW, JUST--
  BUT I'M GETTING SOMEWHERE,
   AND I REMEMBER I COME UP
   FOR, LIKE, HALF A SECOND.
     AND I CAN SEE MY ROOM.
     IT'S LIKE I CAN OPEN
     MY EYES A LITTLE BIT,
        BUT NOTHING'S--
 THERE'S NOTHING THERE ANYMORE.
     AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE
        I'M JUST IN BED
     AND THE ROOM IS LIKE--
        ALL THE DETAILS
     OF THE ROOM ARE GONE.
    THERE'S-- I CAN SEE MY
 NOW EX-GIRLFRIEND'S DRESSER,
      HER LITTLE VANITY,
  AND THERE'S NOTHING ON IT.
        AND I REMEMBER
    I CALLED OUT HER NAME,
        AND NOBODY CAME,
        AND THEN I WAS
    BACK IN THE PARALYSIS.
           AND THEN
     IT WAS ANOTHER FIVE,
  TEN MINUTES OF PULLING OUT,
 AND THEN EVENTUALLY I WOKE UP.
            AND...
       SHE WASN'T THERE.
      NOBODY WAS AROUND,
       BUT... IT JUST--
           IT WAS--
       IT WAS THE WORST.
    I JUST FELT LIKE I DIED.
   YOU KNOW, IT BECAME THIS
 KIND FO TURNING POINT FOR ME
      IN, YOU KNOW, JUST--
      HOW I SAW ALL THIS.
   AND I DEFINITELY DIDN'T
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN EVER AGAIN.
 SO HOW DID THAT CHANGE
            YOUR--
    THE WAY YOU SAW ALL THIS?
        IT JUST-- IT--
       WHEREAS BEFORE,
   I FELT LIKE I WAS MAYBE,
          YOU KNOW,
    LEARNING AND EXPLORING
AND IT WAS, LIKE, KIND OF FUN,
     IT STOPPED BEING FUN.
            LIKE,
   IT'S NOT LIKE I GET TO--
    YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TALK
   ABOUT ASTRAL PROJECTION
     AND ALL THESE, LIKE,
   AWESOME-SOUNDING THINGS,
        LIKE HOW THEY
      GET TO FLY AROUND,
 AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW,
       DO COOL THINGS.
    AND I DON'T GET THAT.
I DON'T GET, YOU KNOW, THOSE.
          I JUST GET
   THESE WEIRD EXPERIENCES
      WHERE I FEEL LIKE,
        FOR A SECOND,
      I CAN SEE SOMETHING
    THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T.
  LIKE, THERE'S WHAT WE SEE
       IN THE WORLD...
     AND RIGHT BEHIND IT,
   YOU KNOW, ALMOST LIKE--
    IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING'S
CELLOPHANE-WRAPPED OR SOMETHING.
AND FOR HALF A SECOND, THAT--
     THAT WRAPPER'S GONE,
        AND I CAN SEE
    OR PERCEIVE SOMETHING
   A LITTLE BIT MORE REAL--
    OR WHATEVER REAL IS--
      AND THEN IT'S GONE.
       BUT I CAN SEE IT
   FOR THAT HALF A SECOND.
  AND SO NO MATTER WHAT FEAR
 OR PAIN COMES ALONG WITH IT,
I ALWAYS GET THIS EXPERIENCE,
WHERE, EVEN IF IT'S IN MY HEAD,
     IT'S MADE SOMETHING
         INTERESTING.
        IT'S SOMETHING
     THAT I CAN PULL FROM
      THAT MAKES MY LIFE
   ALMOST KIND OF WORTH IT,
     WHICH IS, YOU KNOW--
       FOR A LONG TIME,
         IS SOMETHING
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE EVER HAD.
   AND IT'S GONNA PROBABLY
   JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE,
     AND I TRULY BELIEVE
        THAT ONE DAY--
  IT WILL BE THE REASON WHY,
LIKE, ONE DAY I DON'T WAKE UP.
    AND ONE DAY I'M JUST--
  YOU KNOW, I DON'T BREATHE,
I CAN'T CONTROL THE BREATHING,
        AND IT'S DONE.
      AND I FEEL TERRIBLE
    FOR WHOEVER I'M DATING
         OR MARRIED TO
      WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
   UM, BUT I'M KIND OF READY
         FOR THAT NOW.
 CHRIS. HEY, CHRIS.
 YOU KNOW,
   I'M READY FOR THAT TO BE,
    YOU KNOW, JUST KIND OF
      WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.
 BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FIGURE OUT
     A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS
     BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,
  AND IT'S ALSO MADE ME FEEL
       VERY COMFORTABLE
        WITH THE IDEA.
            LIKE,
  IF SOMETHING'S HAPPENING,
     THAT'S MORE THAN...
       I'M JUST CRAZY.
  THEN SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.
