You're looking for jobs?
What's your name?
Lana
ls it like Lana that llama?
You want to go there later?

They close one room
and l clean the other.
You just do it on purpose to
show me you're a prick
What's her name?
Sashi, yes, Sashi.
Living on the river,
without any phones...
- What's with your friend?
- Oh, she'll be alright.
Stay for a while and talk to me.
- Who's there?
- It's me.
Will you just take some ease?
Hi, you want one?
- What are you doing?
- Get dressed, we're leaving
Leaving?
l said get dressed,
we're leaving. Go on
You sure you don't want a feel?
- We're getting outta here?
- We're going elsewhere.
Where?
What the hell is that?
Where're we going?
To somewhere beautiful.
Lana!
l like it here, why go back?
Where's your case?
Don't know
This is amazing.
This is the middle of nowhere.
There's a sign.
A sign for hotel, l bet you.
- Come on.
- There's nothing up that way.
Can't walk anymore
Got a light?
Something just bit me
You sure you haven't got a light?
You don't understand, Morvern
we are lost in the middle of nowhere
l want to go back
l don't like this place,
l'd like to have a great time
There, look!
Somebody's watching
Why can't we leave this place?
Stop laughing, it's not funny
You hate me, don't you?
You still fucking hate me
because he left you
What are you talking about?
- You think he left you because of me.
- Shut up, Lana.
lf it's just that stupid fuck
don't you think l'll get one?
- He's just a bad deal.
- Shut up, Lana.
- Just get over it.
- Shut up! He's dead!
l'm sick of your stupid jokes
l mean we could have been in the club,
instead of surrounded by donkeys and cattles.
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?
Away from you.
That's my case
- Jackie.
- Jackie?
Hello, can l speak to Tom please?
Oh sorry, Tom Boddington
lt's Morvern
lt's Morvern Callar
Hello... yeah, l'm still in Spain
One of the best novels
l've read for a while
l really love to hear such a
distinctive female voice
l like the speech character
- Very fresh.
- Brilliant.
So did you have a good
time in Spain?
lt's great
lt's really beautiful to
see some quiet places
Tell us something about yourself,
about your background
Well, l do books myself
l mean, it's much better than to work in the cold
mornings for 39 years to get your pension.
When you're writing, you just
knock off on your own
Look out the window,
smoke a cigarette,
make a cup of coffee,
take a shower.
ls that okay?
Yeah, sure
Of course, of course
ls there anyone on the business side
who we should be talking specifically?
- Someone back in the U.K.?
- Do you have an agent?
Me, you can talk to me
Directly? Great!
Since we are talking to you directly,
what do you have in mind
to deal with?
We were thinking of something
in the region of 100?
l know it's a bit awkward
talking about money.
l'll be direct, l mean we love
the book, that's why we're here.
We don't just jump on a plane
to Spain at this short notice,
when every manuscript comes
through the door.
But you're a first time writer
and as such we're taking
a risk taking you on...
l can assure you that as a first time writer,
100,000 pounds is really a good deal.
- Can l go to the toilet?
- Of course.
So when can l get the money?
These things take a little bit of time.
We have to go through paperwork,
lawyers, that type of things. We'll sort it out.
How long does that take?
lf you sign the contract here now...
Then by the time we get back to London
we'll get a cheque for you
So Morvern, are you working
on any new material?
Material?
Just give us a few words
What are you working on next?
l'm on holiday
Oh, come on, woman, don't be shy
What's your next book about?
l work in a supermarket
Supermarket? l love it
Here, take a picture
Say cheese
Cheers!
So Morvern, you really
work in a supermarket?
No, it's Lana, Lana Flimstone
that's right
No, l'll call back later.
No. No message, thank you
How've you been?
Same old same old shit, buddy.
Where did you go then?
l met this guy, he's completely
mad and l had a good laugh.
Then l met this guy,
his name is Stuart
He's coming to see me in a fortnight
Well, that's great.
- Lana, l'm going again.
- Where?
To Midcombe, don't worry
about the money.
- What about the money?
- Doesn't matter.
What about your work?
l quit. l'm going to do
anything l like.
- Aren't you happy here?
- Well, yes.
Everyone knows you, here.
Every place is the same, Morvern, stop dreaming.
To the toilet.
