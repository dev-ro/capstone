NETFLIX PRESENTS
Dad!
Daddy!
- Dad!
- Stop!
Let me go! Dad!
Don't worry, don't worry.
Everything's okay, son, I'll be back.
Get in.
- Stay back!
- Daddy!
POLICE
Sadly, between 300 and 400 murders
are committed every year
in our beloved Istanbul.
That means one citizen
is murdered every day.
Every day on our streets,
one person becomes a victim,
another becomes a killer like clockwork.
Luckily for us, some dedicate themselves
to the pursuit of these criminals.
And now one of you
will be named Police Officer of the Year.
This elite unit
has solved the most difficult cases,
bringing theses criminals
swiftly to justice.
And the Police Officer
of the Year is Harun Çeliktan!
Congratulations to you and your unit.
We wish you continued success.
Oh, boy.
I guess they didn't know how else
to get rid of the damn thing.
If Harun is the officer of the year,
we're screwed.
- We're proud of you.
- I appreciate that.
Can't say I'm all that surprised though
that a guy I trained
won Officer of the Year.
Yeah, sure. Yeah.
But what's odd is that none
of the other boys I trained have won it.
I taught them all the same stuff.
So I just get the award,
and you get all the praise.
Is that it?
- Good work, pal.
- Thank you. Thanks.
You know what this means though.
You'll be chief superintendent soon.
Stop acting like you don't know it.
Am I doing that?
You do realize those are antacids, right?
Not candy.
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I am.
I'm just trying to look out for you,
my friend.
And I'm returning the favor. Never mind.
Keep your head down for a while.
Stay out of the limelight.
Lay low. Take it easy. You understand?
Yeah, I do. Don't worry about it.
Harun.
I understand. Okay?
There he is. Great job, chief.
Congratulations.
- Time to hear it from you.
- Hey, hey, he's finally here!
- Congratulations, chief.
- Thank you.
Here, hold on.
- Anything to say for the camera?
- Come on, cut it out, no speeches.
- Tuncay, get a photo.
- Sure.
Let's get a nice one of all of us
with the award.
We're proud of you, chief.
- Guys, come here.
- Come on, hurry up.
- Everybody smile.
- Big smile.
Come in.
I know this is no time for work,
but here you go.
Hello, Chief Inspector.
- Could you please send in Tuncay?
- Sure.
You asked for me, Chief Inspector?
Tuncay, you took the suspect's statement
in person. Is that correct?
Yes, Inspector Yadigar let me
because it was a pretty simple case.
I mean, he gave me a chance.
And then you pissed that chance away
like a rookie.
- I... I don't think I understand.
- You didn't take a statement.
You chatted with him.
He believed you,
and you believed him.
Just two nice guys shooting the breeze.
You get it?
Listen, everyone is innocent
until proven guilty.
That's how the law operates
in this country.
"Everyone's a little guilty
until our suspicions are eliminated."
That's how we operate, got it?
Yes, Chief Inspector.
And most importantly, you broke
a golden rule during your interrogation.
- Which one?
- You gave the guy a cup of tea right away.
You should have waited.
When a suspect asks for tea
and a cigarette, a confession is coming.
- You're right.
- What did he say?
That he truly never meant to kill anyone,
just rob them?
But the guy had a knife
when he broke in there.
So from that moment he entered with it,
nothing was an accident.
Got it?
You're a good boy.
You should stay that way.
But don't make it so obvious
to everyone that you've got a good heart.
Don't forget, it's easy to be good.
It's a lot harder to be just.
That's all.
Um, Chief Inspector,
I was going to teach Aslan how to ride
a bike yesterday, but I couldn't make it.
He's mad at me, isn't he?
Yeah, I think the bike is still sitting
in a box in the living room.
- And Aslan probably thinks you lied.
- Oh, what a shame.
- You can come over this weekend.
- All right, Inspector.
♪ He has a velvet pouch ♪
♪ You can hear him in the coffeehouse ♪
♪ He sits down and gambles ♪
♪ Oh, he is my dearest ♪
Chief Inspector,
we've all been thinking...
Actually, chief, Melda's been thinking.
Ha ha ha. Okay, whatever.
Uh, we thought our chief inspector
is gonna be wearing a tie a lot more now.
So we got you this.
Hmm.
- Wow. What... what is this? Is that...
- Oh, here. Let me help.
- Like this.
- Hmm. Nice.
It looks really nice, right?
- We hope your like it.
- Thank you.
- It's a good luck charm, chief.
- Thank you.
This award isn't just for me.
It's for all of us, the whole team.
Everyone at this table would take a bullet
for the person next to them, right?
Especially them.
They'd lay down in traffic.
But I've saved your asses how many times?
I'm really no good
at this celebration stuff.
Maybe it's just a generational thing.
I... I don't know why,
but celebrating makes us uneasy.
All the pomp and circumstance.
But it's good to be here with you.
I'm happy.
- Here goes. To the best team of the year.
- Yeah!
- Cheers, guys.
- Thank you, Chief Inspector.
Cheers!
Where to next?
Oh, I don't know.
I think chief is done for the night.
All right.
- To all the success in the world.
- We'll do it together, champ.
- Yep.
- Thanks, man.
- No hug for the rest of us, huh, chief?
- Come here, you bastard.
- And the other bastards?
- All right, come here.
Ah!
Come on.
- Don't stick around. Go straight home.
- He's got it.
- I'll take care of it, Chief Inspector.
- Be safe.
Bye.
- Aslan.
- Hi, Dad.
- Son, what are you doing?
- Nothing. Just sitting around.
- Does that mean you're not in bed yet?
- You got an award, so I'm waiting for you.
Yeah, they gave your dad an award.
Are you on your way, Dad?
- No, I'll be back late. Go to bed.
- Come on!
Buddy, everyone's congratulating your dad.
I have to go somewhere.
You go to bed. I'll come in
and give you a hug while you're asleep.
Okay?
This kid should have
been in bed an hour ago, Chief Inspector.
Are you filing a complaint
about him to the police, hmm?
He won't go to bed, honey.
We're both waiting for you.
You two should get some rest, sweetheart.
I'll be home later. Don't wait up for me.
Congratulations, honey. I love you.
I love you too, dear.
I love you very much.
Mm.
TAXI
Where the hell are we?
Hey, I think we're going the wrong way.
Hey, buddy, this is the wrong way.
This is...
I'm talking to you. Are you deaf?
Sir!
- Pull over. I'm a police officer.
- You talk too much. Shut up!
I said pull over!
Get the hell off!
- What are you doing? What do you want?
- Shut the hell up!
Since you're so fucking curious,
let me explain to you why I'm
gonna have to kill you, Chief Inspector.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Shut up!
You're dead now. You're dead!
You're finally gonna pay for what
you've done. You're gonna die tonight!
- Harun.
- Hello.
You know Mr. Arif
from the ministry, right?
- Yeah, I know him.
- I talked to him about you today.
They're really seriously about you.
The good news is around the corner.
What, I thought you'd be happy.
No, I am. I'm happy. I'm hap...
Just sit tight and take it easy.
It's all taken care of.
Okay, buddy, you're good. Gotcha.
See you tomorrow. Good night.
See ya.
All right. All right.
Don't burn your fingers.
And don't eat it
with all the chocolate, Aslan.
Hmm. Hmm.
Hello. Yadigar, how are you?
Yeah, still asleep.
- Mom, milk.
- Oh.
You must have really
let loose last night.
Oh, okay then. I'll wake him.
- I'm wanna wake up dad!
- Wait! Aslan!
I told you not to run inside! Aslan!
Morning, Daddy.
Oh, good morning.
- Good morning, Aslan. Come here. Here.
- Harun, honey.
It's Yadigar.
Come here. Finish your breakfast.
Leave your daddy alone for a little while.
I'm not hungry.
What is it?
Come on, get these people
out of here so we can do our jobs.
Any comment, Chief Inspector?
- Morning, chief.
- Good morning.
Looks like we've got a new maniac.
Go give them a hand.
- What happened to your neck?
- Huh?
Oh, nothing. Cut myself shaving.
Come on, let's go take a look.
What is it?
Nothing.
- Yadigar.
- Yeah.
Do a good thorough sweep.
Look everywhere.
Yes, sir. Okay, go, come on.
Keep them away.
How many times
do I have to say it? Move!
Tuncay!
- Inspector
- Come here.
Coming.
Keep your eyes peeled.
We need to do another sweep, okay?
One more sweep.
- Find anything?
- No, chief, nothing.
Let's check out the trunk real quick.
- Ahmet!
- Yes, sir.
- Get over here.
- Yes, sir.
- Hurry.
- Emir, Tarık!
I'm coming.
- Tarık, get the camera.
- Okay. Here.
- Watch your step.
- I want detailed photos.
Okay? Emin.
Emin, check for fingerprints
on the steering wheel.
There could be a bloodstain.
Mert, take some photos of the trunk.
Be thorough.
Cover every inch of this thing.
No excuses.
Breaking news this morning
as tragedy struck Acıbadem,
where a male corpse
was found hanging from a crane.
The city police have launched
a full investigation
and hope to identify a suspect as...
Some guy decides to commit a murder.
And then he takes the body
and hangs it outside our headquarters.
What's he trying to say?
Look, our honor is at stake here, Harun.
Put everyone in the department on this.
You will drop everything right away
and bring me
this motherfucker's head on a plate!
Who the hell are you? Who are you?
Right under my goddamn nose!
Hello, Inspector Çeliktan,
do you hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.
Then why are you still here? Go!
Hmm.
Jesus Christ!
The fucking nerve!
The victim is a taxi driver
using a different car.
Age 35, single. Name's Ceyhun Arık,
and he's got quite a rap sheet.
He's got an assault charge,
pinched for possession and so on.
Guy went to work in the afternoon
and was murdered that night.
Someone brought him to a construction
site in the trunk of his own cab.
- Was there anything found in the cab?
- We checked it out. Nothing there.
Evidence,
fingerprints, all clean.
We might find something
if we start with the victim's record.
Should we write up a list of suspects?
We've asked for security footage
from the construction site.
- Check the driving route too.
- Okay.
Okay, get to work then.
Always keep this in mind.
- There's no such thing as a little detail.
- Details are inherently little.
Way to go, tiger. That's it.
Hanging someone from a crane
right outside our building...
really makes me wonder
who the hell this daredevil could be.
What about you guys?
Then we need to catch
this crazy bastard yesterday.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Inspector.
- Everybody clear on what I'm saying?
- Yes, Inspector.
Then why are we still standing around?
Come on, guys, move!
We're gonna get this bastard right away.
Come on!
Making a coffee run!
These two cars look exactly the same.
Go see Feyza. She's got an address.
Come on. Hurry up!
Chief, Forensics found
something on the body.
It's evidence.
A tissue sample of the murderer.
A little gift to our department
from under the victim's nails.
Obviously, there was a struggle.
What's the tissue density?
Do you think it's enough to leave a scar?
Probably.
When you find a suspect,
we'd be happy to compare their DNA
to the sample and let you know.
- That's great news. Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.
Oh. Congrats, by the way.
On what?
Inspector Yadigar
mentioned the award you just won.
Ah. Uh-huh. Thanks. I appreciate that.
So you've got a promotion coming up?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Inspector, I found it!
Plates?
34 TJ 66. It matches our suspects.
He going towards Beykoz at 2:05, but then...
Let's see.
Yadigar, come here!
You need to see this.
We followed the taxi's route
back from the construction site.
This is where
the vehicle was first spotted.
Only the driver was inside.
This next shot
is where things get interesting
because now there's
a customer in the back seat.
Except we can't see his face,
but it's clear what happened.
Two people went out, one came back.
There's a really good chance
the customer is our killer.
So if we follow
the last part of the route,
then we might be able to find this guy.
I don't know. There are
lots of spots there with no cameras.
The resolution
on this one isn't so great either.
The customer might have got out
at some point, and another one got in.
- But that area is wooded. Who would go...
- Really?
I didn't know that. Thanks.
Look carefully. Let me know
if you find anything solid.
Yes, Chief Inspector.
All right, you heard him, guys.
Keep going. Keep looking. Come on.
Tuncay.
What are you doing out here by yourself?
- Huh?
- Nothing. Just sitting.
Is there something bothering you?
- Hmm?
- No, nothing.
Come on. I wouldn't be much of a detective
if I couldn't smell a lie.
Go ahead, what is it?
I'm listening.
I understand.
It's your first time on a big case.
- You're scared. That's normal.
- No, sir, that's... that's not it.
Don't worry, it's okay.
We'll solve it.
But, man, it's freezing out here.
Let's go inside, for Christ's sake.
- I didn't notice.
- Come on, let's go.
Come on, pal.
- What the hell?
- What?
- You been hitting the gym?
- Uh, I just started, Inspector.
- Really?
- Yeah.
All right, good call.
What about the ladies? How's that going?
Why are you laughing?
Out with it.
Come on, I'm your bro. Any dates, huh?
- Hi, chief.
- Thank you, İzzet.
- Evening, Chief Inspector.
- Hey, there.
- What are you doing?
- We're still looking, Chief Inspector.
Yeah, right.
Hold on a second.
- Check the access roads too.
- Okay. Okay, yes, sir.
Yeah, it looks good, thanks.
- So where you checking?
- Around Bahçeköy, chief.
Can you zoom in?
All right, thanks.
Chief Inspector.
I think I found something.
One of the cameras
on the way to the construction site
has a clear shot of the murderer.
Stop there. Now zoom in.
- The body's there too, right?
- I think so.
- Uh-huh. Let's go.
- Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Suspect ran out the rear window.
Come on, split into teams of two. Hurry.
Hurry up. You go with Melda.
- Come on, come on. Keep going!
- Go, go, go!
- All clear here. We're still looking.
- Copy. Over.
Hey!
Stop!
- Talk!
- I swear, he was already dead!
When I saw him, he had a knife
in his chest. He had been stabbed.
I swear, I was just doing
what that guy told me to do.
- That's it!
- What guy?
I don't know anything about the body.
He told me to take the taxi
to that address, so I did.
- Who told you?
- I swear. I swear I had no fucking idea.
- Bastard fucked my life for 250 liras.
- Who are you talking about?
Anyone see the suspect?
Ah!
No! No!
Move, go!
So, what happened?
Well, I aimed for his leg.
Even though he was running
across the roof?
This guy, murderer or not,
died during a patrol.
Who else saw the incident on the roof?
I take full responsibility.
I was right behind the chief, Inspector.
The suspect could have gotten away.
And it was dark.
He also attacked him with a knife, so...
I'm willing to testify, sir. Trust me.
Inspector Ongen is telling the truth.
I saw it as well.
- Me too.
- Me too.
Me too!
We ran over there, and we all saw it.
They ran over and saw it!
Whaddya know?
It's okay as long
as he was your perp.
So is he? Is he the killer?
Based on his record,
he was our guy.
A loner type with mental health issues
and a long criminal record.
According to the phone records,
whoever told him what to do
didn't make direct contact.
But we found something.
The records show one number in common
between both the deceased.
We checked it,
and it was registered three years ago.
- Nir Agency.
- Nir Agency. Right.
It's a management company,
casting agency.
And during the incident,
both of the deceased
were under the influence of drugs.
A Class A substance known as Metopon
showed up in their blood work.
What the fuck does that mean?
Metopon. It's an opioid.
It's derived from morphine.
And we never knew about this?
Am I right?
It's not
a well-known street drug, chief.
But I bet
Narcotics would have heard of it.
Forensics says that
the substance is highly toxic, chief.
The demand fell right away
because of all the deaths.
In fact, now it's one of the hardest drugs
to find out there.
Yeah, it's very difficult.
So, how did these bastards find it?
Hmm?
I mean, maybe they fought over it.
One of them killed the other.
Brought him here, then hung him
from the crane outside, right?
Is that right?
Well, this will all come down
to the tissue test.
I mean, if there's a match, the case
will be closed. Right, Chief Inspector?
Yeah, right, right.
Did you say it was urgent?
Did you tell the lab it was urgent?
Yeah, yes, we did.
We get the results tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
They ran over and saw it. Yeah.
Yep, yep, yep, yep. Mm-hmm.
Good afternoon. We're here in front
of the Istanbul Police Department.
The authorities now believe
that the person found dead
is the so-called "crane killer."
And at this point, we're just
waiting to hear from the police.
And now it looks like the Istanbul
chief of police has just arrived.
Yep, I'm recording.
Sir,
will you be making a statement today?
Sir, do you have any information
on the victim or the suspects?
We're waiting for
the forensic report to confirm our find.
Can you release the name
of the suspect?
- No.
- Do you have a name?
Are you willing to release
the name of the suspect, sir?
When I make the report,
I'll make a statement.
What can you tell us?
- Absolutely nothing.
- When will the police know?
We're going downstairs with the guys
to grab a bite to eat. Wanna tag along?
No, thanks, Yadigar.
I should keep working.
You're not blaming yourself for this,
are you, chief?
All right then.
Fuck!
Both of the deceased
were under the influence of drugs.
A Class A substance known as Metopon
showed up in their blood work.
What the hell?
What's up, buddy?
You two, get out.
- What? What did you just say?
- Get out.
You have exactly three seconds
to fuck off.
- Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. Just go.
- What the fuck?
Hey, I need to talk in private
with the Chief Inspector.
Why didn't he just say he was a cop?
What's up, buddy, we good?
"What's up, buddy, we good?"
How do you make so many mistakes
in a sentence that short?
First of all,
I wouldn't be here if there was good news.
And second...
God forbid
that I'm ever unlucky enough
to have someone like you for a friend.
I'll ask you one thing.
You're going to answer me right away,
and then I'll leave.
Metopon. Who makes it? Who distributes?
Well, we've been out of that game
for a some time, Inspector.
I mean, believe me, we really
paid the price, and now it's over.
On my kid's life,
I'm not dealing, Chief Inspector.
Ow!
I'm very, very upset, Şerat.
It's been one thing after another lately,
and I can't seem to catch a break.
Someone's fucking around behind my back,
and I just can't figure it out.
I'm filling up with rage.
So now, I need somebody just like you.
A dirty piece of shit scumbag
who I can use to vent all my anger.
I swear, we're not doing
that kind of business anymore.
I told you. I swear on my kid. What else
do you want me to say, Chief Inspector?
Chief...
I need you to promise me
that you'll never swear on a kid's life
ever again, Şerat. Understand?
Okay, okay. I won't. I won't.
Metopon, you said?
Hey, look, uh, yeah,
nobody wants metopon anymore.
Uh, okay, maybe there are
a few maniacs left just here and there.
Stop telling me stories. I want names.
- Oh, man, come on now.
- Huh?
Okay, okay, okay! Listen.
They...
they actually call it meth, all right?
There was this huge operation last year.
And because
there were film producers
and actors buying a lot of product.
- Actors?
- Yeah, I swear.
That's when it was the most popular.
After that, just here and there.
It's dangerous shit. I'm serious.
What do you want me to say?
That stuff kills people!
No kidding.
And that breaks your heart, doesn't it?
Which actor?
It's this one. It's this one.
She was a girl.
Gül, uh, Gül Cankır.
Gül Cankır, all right?
The results just came in.
And?
No match. He's not our guy.
- Not the guy on the roof.
- All right.
Didn't you say
he was the murderer?
I told you
to keep a low profile, didn't I?
Trouble's been following
me around ever since then.
Who's chasing who here?
You or the trouble?
Just let the fucker go.
Why'd you have to shoot him?
- I was just trying to catch him, chief.
- Harun.
Just get that promotion and then...
What really happened? Tell me.
Whatever it says in the report.
Nothing else.
Nothing else?
No.
Harun.
All of a sudden,
this has become my problem.
I know I'm headed for trouble.
I'm trying to get your promotion.
I get at least three calls
a day from Ankara.
Ever since someone
hung that body outside our door,
I'm on the phone every day
saying crap like,
"You're right, sir.
It's all under control, sir. Don't worry."
And I really
don't like calling people "sir."
Do you know what I mean?
I just say "I'm on it,"
but we've got nothing.
Harun!
Figure this out as soon as possible.
We will, sir. Don't worry.
Oh, God. Get the fuck out of here.
If I had my way, we'd hang
that fucker up there on the same crane!
That one right there.
This isn't terrorism or something.
Why? Why would anyone do this?
Hmm?
How the hell
are you gonna get out of this?
I'll fix it.
Well, hurry up.
We need to get this done.
She was a smart girl.
Really talented too.
But she was trouble. She started acting
weird on set whenever we sent her out.
Then all of a sudden as soon
as the big narcotics scandal broke out,
that was it. We cut ties
and never heard from her again.
What about an address,
phone number, anything?
I can look around.
Chief Inspector, can I ask,
is Gül in some kind of trouble again now?
No, she came up in a case.
We just want some information from her.
Like I said, I'll look into it for you.
If I find anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.
Thanks.
- Can I get you some more tea?
- No, no, thanks.
All right, I should probably get going.
This is my card.
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.
SURVEILLANCE CENTER
- Hi, Özlem. How you doing?
- Oh, hey, Tuncay. I'm good.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
Looks like we lost some camera footage.
Any chance we could recover that from you?
Okay, what's the date on that?
December 21.
- Okay. Uh, give me a few minutes, okay?
- Sure.
- Who are you looking for?
- Hmm?
I'm Inspector Çeliktan. Harun Çeliktan.
And I'm nothing but an old man.
What do you want from me?
- Do you know the deceased?
- I'm the father of the deceased.
My condolences.
We think someone else
probably sent him there.
Do you have any thoughts or ideas
that can help us with that?
That's true.
My son and I were always sent
by someone else on every single job.
When did we ever have the opportunity
to choose what work we did?
What the fuck
was he going to do on his own?
You're the one that shot my son.
Isn't that right?
He attacked me.
So I aimed for his leg, actually.
- Hi, hon, how was your day?
- It was fine, honey.
Daddy, look what Tuncay brought me!
- Tuncay is here? How are you, Tuncay?
- Hi, chief.
- Let me see. Hmm.
- Look.
- Shouldn't you be in bed by now?
- Well, he should.
But he's been waiting for you.
- All right, bedtime.
- Come on. Say good night.
- Good night, Tuncay.
- Good night.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, love you.
- Love you too.
- What's up, Tuncay?
I need to talk to you about something,
Chief Inspector.
- Let's talk.
- Can we talk outside?
Chief Inspector...
Go ahead, son.
Uh, I wanted
to ask your advice about something
because I don't know what to do.
I'm listening.
Well, uh...
There's this supervisor
at this place I work.
I have a lot
of respect and admiration for him.
Uh...
and I found something
that belonged to him
at the scene of a murder investigation.
At first, I thought it was a coincidence,
but then...
then I saw my supervisor hiding
a piece of evidence critical to the case.
The video footage.
The only person
who could help us in this case
was shot by my supervisor.
I was confused and didn't know what to do.
I was curious about the footage, chief.
So I watched it all.
We put him in a taxi that same night.
We were so proud of him.
What do I do in this situation?
You're our chief,
and I wanted to ask you because
I thought you'd know better than me.
I mean, I'm saying
maybe there's something I don't know.
I've made a decision, Chief Inspector.
He must know something.
He'll solve it. I know he will.
And I think it's better for me to just
keep learning from him and move forward.
Good night, Chief Inspector.
I've abused my authority.
I committed a murder
and didn't report it to the police.
I tampered with evidence.
I deliberately obstructed the progress
and scope of the investigation.
Please accept my resignation
and take me into police custody
at your earliest convenience.
- Hello. Who's this?
- Hello, Chief Inspector.
This is Süha from Nir Agency.
Go ahead, Mr. Süha.
Uh, Miss Gül finally called,
and we talked about you.
I... I'm not sure how she found out,
but she called
and told me she'd see you soon.
She said she'll see me soon? How?
Apparently, she knows you well.
How does she know me?
That's all she said.
Just that she'd see you very soon.
And that Gül
and a couple of her friends...
uh, opened some place called Maçça Club.
In Kadıköy. I thought
I'd let you know in case it helps.
Thanks, appreciate it.
MAY 11, GEBZE
JUNE 6, GÜNGÖREN
JULY 2, KÜÇÜKÇEKMECE
Yeah, Chief Inspector.
Yadigar, I'm going to give you some dates.
And I want to tell me what happened
on each of these days.
Okay, one second.
May 11, Gebze.
Got it.
June 6, Güngören.
July 2, Küçükçekmece.
All right, I'm checking.
Murders were committed
in all three places.
And...
What? Go on. What is it?
All three victims were police officers.
Bünyamin Babaoğlu,
Hasan Gürelioğlu, Eren Oylum.
Okay.
Chief Inspector, we're running out
of time. We need to get moving.
- What happened?
- Zeyrek. We got a lot of dead bodies.
Regular customers.
They hang out here every day.
- They were all killed on the same night.
- They were poisoned, chief.
- Get up! Get up!
- Get up! Get your shoes on.
- Clear out!
- Hey, easy! What are you doing?
I didn't do anything.
Why did you kill these guys?
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Who's this?
Talk!
How about this one right here?
You wanna tell us their names?
Do you know this place?
Explain to me why every morning
the paper tells me
exactly how fucking incompetent we are.
Find the killer now! You have two days!
This individual
works at the location
where the incident occurred.
And we have compelling evidence
that implicates him in the crime.
Samples of the toxic substance
in the victims' soup
were found in the suspect's home.
It's clear
there was a pattern of mistreatment
by many people in his workplace.
He clearly harbored a grudge
and took his revenge.
He killed seven people
by poisoning the soup served every night.
The statements
of two separate witnesses have been taken.
Chief Inspector, the guy we arrested,
I'm not sure he's the one.
- Is the evidence solid?
- Yeah, looks that way.
- What did the prosecutor say?
- Nothing.
Okay, then, out.
Hey, hey, sorry.
Look at me, hey!
Let me explain to you
why I'm gonna have to kill you.
Hey! Hey!
Look at me when I'm talking.
I swear, he was already dead!
7 DEAD IN GRUESOME MURDER IN ISTANBUL
Does Ramazan Türel
have any children?
Is this about
someone's long-held personal vendetta?
Yeah, but who?
Yes, ma'am, can we help you?
I'm here to turn myself in.
Can you tell us what you did?
I killed a few people a while ago.
And I hanged the last one
from a crane on the construction site
right outside your window.
You're looking for the Crane Killer?
That's me.
This way.
Gül Cankır, from Istanbul.
No statement yet. Actress, 23 years old.
She has a history of narcotics, and she...
well...
Well, what?
She only wants
to speak Chief Inspector Çeliktan.
She wants to talk to him privately.
- Why's that?
- I have no idea.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
How do you turn the sound off in here?
Sorry to disappoint everybody out there.
But this is private.
I guess we can finally start now.
Please, Mr. Çeliktan.
You wanted to see me in private.
Why's that?
You don't want everyone
to hear this conversation.
I promise you.
- I don't?
- That's what I said.
Oh, God.
Yeah, fine, go ahead.
How did you kill the taxi driver?
I can't tell you.
- Why not?
- Because it wasn't me who killed him.
Who killed him then?
You did.
You killed him.
What do you want, darling?
I'm not your darling,
but we actually do know each other.
We weren't officially introduced,
but it was many years ago
when you and I met for the first time.
It was a very rainy day.
I could really use a cigarette
right about now, hmm?
Anyway...
That was the most people
I'd ever seen in our neighborhood.
I sure remember seeing you there.
Blue lights
were flashing everywhere that night.
I seems like we could never get rid
of those blue lights.
Anyway...
And you...
I mean, the strangers with the flashing
blue lights took my father away.
We never heard a word from him again.
Turns out prison isn't kind to people
who are convicted of mass murder.
Your brother.
I remember you had a brother, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Who knows?
Maybe he's still out there somewhere.
Foster kids don't usually have a way
to keep in touch with each other.
Some of them
do look for their siblings,
but I couldn't be bothered.
What would I do if I found him anyway?
- So, you did all this?
- Mm-hmm.
Hanging a body from a crane?
You did that, as a woman?
Well, you know,
you wouldn't believe the things
that most women would do
if they were given the chance.
Sure, the crane thing
was tough to pull off.
But if everything had gone
the way I planned it,
the taxi driver would have killed you,
then the case would have been closed.
But when you killed him,
things got complicated.
In the end, it worked out though.
In the meantime, you killed two guys
who'd given evidence against my father.
It actually worked out better
than I thought it would.
Too complicated for a man like you?
Why don't you tell me
what you want from me?
Okay, here goes.
Two of the guys
who helped me take care of the murders
that night ended up getting killed.
So, naturally, I thought I'd ask you
to provide the same service.
What service is that?
You're going to kill someone else for me.
Or I have a very compelling video
of the murder you committed.
You heard that, right?
I have a new job for you, Chief Inspector,
should you choose to accept it.
Actually, you can
probably guess who it is.
There are only two of you left
who ruined our lives.
You and...
You choose.
Either you're going to
commit one more murder
or pay the price
for what you've already done.
- Look at me, darling...
- I'm not your darling.
All right, you're not.
Thank God, you're not!
Your father poisoned seven people.
No, he didn't. You just couldn't find
the person who was responsible for it.
So do you accept my offer?
Your father wasn't falsely accused.
Even if he was...
I'm just waiting
for your answer, Inspector.
What do you say? Do you accept my offer?
You have until tonight to decide.
If you don't do what I want,
I'll post your video all over social media
for everyone to see.
Don't forget to like my post.
So, did she really do it?
I don't know.
Her statement's full of inconsistencies.
Like she's making it up as she goes along.
Maybe she wants
to be famous or something.
That said,
we should hold onto her,
just to be absolutely sure.
Why'd she talk to you in private?
I don't get it, either. Who knows?
How'd she know your name?
My name?
Did you even ask?
Yeah, I did, but I told you,
but she wasn't making sense.
So...
All right, relax.
Okay.
Yadigar, come here.
Yes, sir.
- Get in there and talk to her. Go in.
- Will do.
Come in.
Hey.
So, did she say anything?
Sir, she's crazy. I think she's tripping.
She keeps asking for fruit yogurt.
- Fruit yogurt?
- Uh-huh.
She wants the fruit and yogurt separate.
She's asking if we can throw a party
for the press release.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
She's nuts.
Just let her go.
But let her out the back door.
The press are out front right now.
- Will do, chief. Where you headed?
- I'm going swimming. Can you believe it?
- Swimming? Hmm.
- Yeah.
It's my back. Doctor says I should swim.
Promised my wife too.
The swimming's fine.
I just get cold there.
You know what I mean?
Call the facility
and tell them to turn up the heat.
Of course, sir.
- No problem. Mm-hmm.
- And call off the driver.
I'm gonna drive myself.
Hand me those pills. No, that one.
Yep.
- Here you go, sir. I'll take that.
- That's okay. The door.
Going swimming at this age. God damn.
Yadi, where's the girl?
Chief Tunahanlı told me to let her go.
The press is outside, and if they
knew she was here, it'd be a mess.
Find out where she is and follow her.
You talked to her. She's crazy.
Why would we follow her?
Just need to keep tabs on her.
I still haven't gotten
to the bottom of this.
- Of course, sir.
- Go on.
İlyas, take Tuncay with you.
Follow that girl we just let go.
- Got it.
- Okay. Go, go, go!
- Leave the coffee. Get out of here.
- Come on, get your coat!
Where'd she go?
Come on! I told you not
to let her out of your sight!
Sorry, man,
she turned all of a sudden, and I...
"Turned all of a sudden."
Really? You gotta be kidding me.
How could you lose her?
What is it?
- They just lost her trail.
- Where?
Where are you?
Uh, in Ataşehir, by the department
rec center and athletic club.
They're by the athletic club
and rec center.
- Where's the chief?
- He's going swimming.
Swimming?
You need to find that girl right now,
Yadigar, understand? Right now!
Wherever you lost her,
you need to pick up her trail, guys, now!
Come on, Cevat, pick up, pick up!
Cevat, god damn it!
Hello.
Chief Inspector, this is Gül.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I'm calling because...
your time's almost up.
I wanted to know
if you'd come to a decision yet.
Stop right now.
Cut this shit out or I swear you'll be...
I guessed it.
All right, then.
I'll have to do my own dirty work.
I'm warning you.
- Hello.
- You came by just in time.
You're going the wrong way.
Like I said, Inspector,
I had a feeling you wouldn't do it.
So, I left a little package
for the chief in his car.
I don't know
if it'll explode like in the movies,
but I gave it my best shot.
Wait, Cevat! Cevat, wait!
Get out of the car!
Oh! Cevat!
Cevat...
Cevat...
Now it's just the two of us
who remember that day.
I'm going to tear you into pieces.
I'm going to tear you into pieces!
I'm glad I still have your attention.
Because there's still a loose end
that you need to tie up.
You need to find the real murderer
in my father's case.
Tuncay, you follow the girl.
Chief Inspector, what happened?
- Where's the girl? Where's the girl?
- Tuncay is following her, chief.
Chief Tunahanlı
and Chief Inspector Çeliktan
were in charge of this case.
The murdered cops were
working the same case.
The dead taxi driver
was one of their witnesses.
The other witness is the guy
Inspector Çeliktan shot on the roof.
What the fuck?
- Inspector Ongen.
- What?
Inspector!
It's Chief Tunahanlı.
There was a car explosion.
Tuncay, where is she?
I'm headed towards Kadıköy.
Look, Tuncay, you know
some bad things have happened.
Doesn't matter.
It's a long story,
but I'll make things right. Just trust me.
But right now I need this girl.
Stay on her.
Stay on her! Don't lose her, Tuncay.
She's very dangerous. Don't make contact.
Just don't lose her, okay?
I'm on it, Chief Inspector.
I'm calling
about the Ramazan Türel file.
I need information
about Ramazan Türel's children.
First, can I confirm
the Turkish ID number and name again?
Okay.
Emre.
But wait. Uh, what...
what was the name after the adoption?
Here we are. We knew...
on the last night
we've always talked about,
but were never quite sure
what really happened, you know.
Darling.
I'm not really sure
how you feel about it, but...
I think I played my part well.
I just cooked up the strongest
little present I'll ever have.
I'm so exhausted.
I deserve some rest too.
Don't you think so?
You're the only one
I would have loved...
...if I knew how to love.
Goodbye.
Hi, Inspector.
Tuncay, I need your help
with something. It's urgent.
- I'm in pursuit, Inspector.
- Forget the pursuit.
- Come to the location I'm sending you.
- Of course, sir.
Tuncay.
You made it.
Your real name is Emre Türel.
After your father died, you were adopted.
You took the name Tuncay Kökdemir.
Well done. Well done.
Put in a few more years,
they might give
you an award, too, Yadigar, huh?
Piece of shit!
You were...
You were like a brother to us, man.
So, we loved you
and took care of you this whole time,
and you betrayed us from the beginning.
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
What shitty luck.
Just when you find the murderer...
...you wanna kill her.
But you know she's already fading away.
I always talked
about this with my brother, you know?
My brother Emre.
You know him as Tuncay, I think.
- Tuncay, you said?
- Uh-huh.
Tuncay.
You asked, right?
"Didn't you have a brother?"
I was trying really hard not to laugh.
Not that he was
right under your nose or anything.
And I'm Gülendam.
Changed to Gül.
They really butchered my name.
Son,
this is how you wanna play it, huh?
This isn't how you get justice.
How else do you get justice?
Doesn't matter. That's it. It's over.
You're under arrest, Tuncay.
Fuck you.
Tuncay, you're under arrest. Tuncay!
You gonna kill me, man? Huh?
Are you gonna handcuff me
without telling me
how you're gonna hold 'em responsible
for what happened to my father,
my family, huh?
Huh? Are you gonna handcuff me, man?
Motherfucker!
Stop! Stop, man!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop! Why won't you stop? Huh?
Why are you making me
beat my brother? Why won't you stop?
- Okay.
- You were my friend.
How the hell could you do this to me?
How could you betray us, huh? Answer me!
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey!
There's one more thing I have to do.
And you need to get out of my way.
You're not going to hell, son.
I'm pretty sure
you were born there, tiger.
So I told my brother...
...since no one even knew
the two of us were born...
...the least they could do
is show both of our deaths on the news.
Tuncay! Tuncay, you...
Daddy.
Aslan, honey.
Are you on your way? Tuncay's here too.
- We're in the park, Dadd y.
- Which park, son?
- Hello, Inspector.
- Tuncay, Tuncay, don't.
Listen, I promise I'll tell you
the truth about your father's injustice.
I'll find the real killer,
but please don't touch my son.
When you find the killer,
do you promise to take care of him for me?
Yes, yes, I promise!
Where are you?
We're in the park by your house, chief.
Okay, I'm coming.
Don't touch him, please.
Can you zoom in?
Get out of the car!
I think I played my part well.
You're the only one I really loved,
if I knew how to love.
Goodbye.
Aslan! Son!
Where are you?
Where's my son?
- Good to see you, Chief Inspector.
- I said, where's my son?
I was around his age.
My dad and me, my sister.
We had no one else.
Daddy, come on. I'm starving!
Delicious eggs are ready.
Share the breakfast...
Okay.
It wasn't me. It was the Tickle Monster.
My father served those scum
to take care of us.
Those bastards were nothing
but a bunch of fucking roaches and rats.
Come on, deal!
- Fucking idiot. These aren't even cold.
- Sure, sure, they are.
Then one night,
my father didn't come home.
I got scared. I went there.
Then I was able to see
what they were doing to him.
They accused him of stealing money.
Huh?
Not one of them
ever said "stop" or "don't do it."
They had their fun. They embarrassed him.
There was no dignity that day.
Dignity didn't live
in our neighborhood anyway.
Guys, guys! What the hell's going on?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
So it was you.
Yeah, it was. I told you.
I screamed and shouted,
but no one took me seriously.
I said my father didn't do this,
but you didn't listen.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My dad didn't do it.
Okay, son, okay.
It's cold out here. Go inside, come on.
Hurry, hurry, come on!
When my father was killed in prison,
my sister and I made a promise.
And now here we are.
Yes, Chief Inspector.
Now that you found the real killer,
what are you gonna do?
- Tuncay.
- You promised.
Daddy! Daddy!
- Aslan, come here.
- Don't be scared. It's okay.
- Let me go!
- It's okay. It's okay.
Chief Inspector Harun Çeliktan!
Put your gun down now and surrender.
Now you're in the same position
as my father.
They'll call you a murderer
and take you away in front of your child.
You promised.
You'll shoot me.
And then our friends here will shoot you.
Don't, Tuncay.
You can't fix anything
by ruining everyone's life.
Who wants to fix anything?
Besides, what part of my life can I fix?
You can put an end
to this cycle of grudges.
Harun!
Put your gun down and surrender!
You're going to be
a very honest person, okay?
You understand?
Come on, go inside. Don't get cold.
Come on, son.
You're right, Chief Inspector.
I can put an end it.
Tuncay!
Tuncay!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
- So what's your ranking?
- Twenty-nine, Chief Inspector.
Hmm. Good.
You beat the 30th guy. Nice job.
Mm-hmm.
Number 29 out of how many?
That's good. Hmm.
- Good work, son.
- Thank you, Chief Inspector.
I'm really proud of you. Hmm.
How's the trainer, Orçun?
Well, he's still in great shape.
Still very upright.
Always talking about you.
Oh, yeah?
What's he say?
He's proud of you,
and your integrity is exemplary.
Exemplary?
Not at all.
But I'm trying.
I am trying.
