Wasn't he thin?
That was just before I met him.
You can't even say he's fat.
No, but he's plumb.
He doesn't take enough exercise.
I think he's lost a little weight.
I hadn't noticed it.
That was when...
Michel was born...
Flowers for you...
Sweet of you, Michel.
How Lovely!
Who's that?
And that one?
It's Late... I'm off.
I'll come with you.
I'll come too.
Quite the Little gentleman.
I'll stay here if I may.
Of course, Helen.
You must come to me next time.
You ought to take exercise.
You'll soon be really fat.
I'm very well as I am.
A change in my way
of living would be dangerous.
Should I fish?
I'm no racing motorist.
Listen, it's my only pleasure...
Only eccentricity.
No, like Pernod. That's eccentric.
Where are my glasses?
I'll go and get them.
Yes, on the mantelpiece.
I can't tell you.
Not at all.
Mama forgot her glasses.
Wrong number.
Ah, here they are.
Thank you, dear.
You Love me?
Why ask that?
Do you Love me?
Of course.
About those pictures...
They wonder if the chap managed...
to get forged certificates.
May I read in bed?
You can go to bed.
No telly?
It bores me.
Goodnight, son.
What is it?
"Origins of God".
What's it Like?
Not bad!
And your son's example.
Leave me to my vice.
I even Like the worst.
Your mother's wonderful.
But one day she'll have an accident.
She's an excellent driver.
Not up to rally standard.
I find this superb!
When do you Leave?
Why?
I have things...
to do in town.
About ten. Suit you?
Very good.
Coffee?
What have you to do...
in town tomorrow?
Have my skin cleaned.
That makes me Laugh!
Then the hairdresser.
Perhaps a cinema...
Anything good on?
They'll tell me at Carita.
Shall we Lunch.
I don't think I'll have time.
I don't think so.
I'll bring you back?
Don't worry.
No, I'll wait at the office.
"There's been a slight technical hitch".
Isn't it hot?
Let's open the window.
Goodnight, darling.
Aren't you...
asleep?
I wanted to ask you that.
Shall I light up?
If you Like.
You're a bundle of nerves.
You're tired, darling.
A little.
I think I can sleep now.
Read if you want.
No, you can...
switch off now.
At the usual place?
Come to the office?
Yes, so Long.
Chain smoking!
You think?
Sure of it.
Let's have a drink. Thirsty?
Always am.
Shorter every day!
We're thirsty, Brigit.
Beer for me.
Me too.
She's after your body.
She's had it.
Pig... well?
More enthusiasm than skill.
She just thinks sex is important...
...but in fact she doesn't care.
How's the time?
Parking disks! My turn to go.
I need fresh air.
There, almost frozen.
Frozen beer of the frozen North.
<l>I'm a complete and utter Frenchman.</l>
<l>Completely and utterly French.</l>
<l>I have excellent tobacco in my pouch.</l>
<l>But it's all for me and none for you.</l>
<l>all for me and none for you.</l>
<l>If anyone attacked...</l>
<l>my beloved country...</l>
<l>I'll sing the Marseillaise...</l>
<l>with my fists in the air...</l>
<l>I'll sing the Marseillaise...</l>
<l>on the Champs Elysee.</l>
Know what I said?
I said "Go to hell!"
Telephone, please.
Downstairs next to the toilets.
Yes, what can you do?
Carita? Mme Desvallees, please.
Is that Carita?
Mme Desvallees. I'm her husband.
It's okay.
No... it doesn't matter.
Cigarettes?
Celtiques.
There you are, Sir.
Madam is here.
Come in, darling.
Am I too early?
No, I've finished.
Have a drink?
Whisky.
Two whiskies.
She's not bad.
Paul says she's no good.
By the way, where is Paul?
Minding his own business.
I tried to phone you.
To tell you I'd finish early.
I wasn't told.
No, you'd left.
I went to Zhivago again.
I thought...
you didn't like it.
Well, I thought I'd go again.
I liked it this time.
Thanks, Brigit.
For once, I know the story.
That's true.
From 1852 to 1860 Napoleon III...
governed France
like his uncle Napoleon I...
and recognized...
the right of the French...
to...
universal suffrage.
But before the election.
He told the public...
who they must vote for.
Those candidates were elected.
Do it again before bed.
You know what you'll do.
You'll read that book.
I'll get a prize anyhow.
Run along then.
I'd like to do something nice for you.
Let's go to a night club.
What do you say?
Not tonight. Tomorrow, say...
We'll make up a party.
Paul...
George and his wife...
Fred and Marianne...
But Fred has Left Marianne...
Then Fred without Marianne.
Well, what d'you think?
I'd Like it very much.
Don't singe them.
Better with a weaker spirit...
which keeps its aroma.
He's a wonderful cook.
Terrific.
I'm out of practice.
Well, a Lovely dinner!
Charles...
tonight was fabulous.
The hermit's Left his cave.
It was Helen's idea.
No, it was yours.
Yours. I read your eyes.
Did you enjoy diner?
Come and dance!
No thanks. I'm amusing myself.
I'll get your bottle.
See to the gentleman.
You Look Like a fool.
You don't just Look Like one...
Seen Helen?
Helen? No...
I'm very busy.
George, seen Helen?
Got pins and needles?
I want to dance.
Not now... I'm tired.
Out of training.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Seen Paul's doll?
She's amazing!
What about a drink?
How are you?
Good. Have a seat.
You've got a great tan.
Meet Charles and Helen.
How about it?
You are unlucky!
Not at all!
We'll say goodbye.
Lovely evening!
A pleasure.
Get her home quickly.
Well, so Long.
Kiss Maude for me.
What a drunk.
Are you mad?
Enjoy it?
You're sweet.
What are you up to?
I couldn't sleep.
What an odd child!
I want you here.
You're quite mad, my boy.
Go to bed.
You'll be tired.
No school tomorrow.
I hate it when you're not here.
Now off to bed.
For a little boy who's ten...
you're not acting Like one.
Why thank me?
For tonight...
for Michel...
for everything.
Stop! Michel will hear.
Suppose he got up again...
Will you phone my wife and ask her...
what she asked me to bring her.
Find that file yet?
Got a handkerchief?
Caught a cold.
Ah, here it is!
About time too!
I spoke to the maid.
Madam is in Paris.
Thank you... Brigit.
Then she'll get it herself.
She didn't trust me.
Send for some paper hankies.
I have some here.
Bignon? Desvallees here.
Yes. Desvallees.
Could I see you right away?
Thanks, Brigit.
When can you?
Perfect.
No, not at the office.
It's... I'll explain.
Know the caf√© next door?
See you there in half an hour.
Very good.
Been waiting Long?
Don't worry...
Come over here.
Cassis Beer and a coffee for me.
About those pictures...
the experts said...
the certificates were Okay...
But the pictures were forgeries.
It wasn't about that but...
a personal matter.
Excuse me...
the Cassis Beer?
I want to know how...
a certain person spends her time.
You know my wife?
I've met her twice at your office.
I'd Like to know what she does...
where she goes, who she sees.
You understand?
You'll do it?
But you don't Like doing it?
Yet it's your job.
Of course.
I suspect her...
of being unfaithful.
I want to know her lover's name.
I want to know who he is.
I understand.
How Long do you want me to do this?
I don't know...
three or four days...
Then we'll meet in four days.
Yes.
Where?
I don't know... here?
We must find somewhere more discreet.
I'll find a place but...
Suppose I find nothing out...
I want the truth.
Very good, Sir.
Don't be late. There's a surprise.
This time you waited...
Doesn't matter.
Have you found...
Yes, sir.
Do you happen to know...
a Mr. Victor Pegala?
Is that him?
Yes, that's him.
Your wife visits him every other day.
Say three times a week.
She stays about two hours.
They never go out.
Have you seen him?
I have his picture.
What does he do?
He's a writer but...
he has money of his own.
His address?
27, rue du Bois de Boulogne...
I'm very sorry...
How much do I owe?
Here are the vouchers.
Just 500 Francs.
Goodbye.
I don't think...
we'll ever meet again.
Mummy, daddy's here!
You're home soon.
Like a drink?
What's going on?
What is all this?
Something to celebrate.
I'm going to have champagne.
In honor of what?
Go on tell him.
I'm first in history... with a prize.
Are you sure?
Then Champagne is a must.
Good health!
To your success!
To this wonderful day!
To this wonderful day!
Would you Like coconut cake?
Can I Look in this drawer?
Of course.
Is that you in this picture?
What picture?
That's my son.
You have a kid.
Two... a boy and a girl.
Does that bother you?
No, but...
I just never thought about it.
The boy is seven.
And the girl is... five.
Your married? Divorced?
Divorced.
Married for five years.
It was hell.
Your kids Live with your wife?
Better that way.
Hey, pass me a cigarette.
You see them often?
Once a month.
Sometimes I spend a whole week.
They Like you okay?
I'm a good father.
What a conversation.
I couldn't Live without my son.
I hope not.
Nor could my husband.
That's wonderful.
How about more tea.
What's the time?
5 o'clock.
I should go.
Leaving?
When do I see you again?
The day after tomorrow.
Why not tomorrow.
Because I can't.
The day after then.
Should I call you a cab.
I'll flag one down.
But, it's raining.
"The impossible meeting...
of existential spheres occurs here.
The past and future are reconciled."
I missed the train.
I couldn't find a taxi...
so I took a bus.
I waited at the station.
I'll get a drink.
You should have called the office.
I didn't know what I was doing.
A big beard there.
And here a mustache.
It's a man.
A little man.
I'm off.
You're not going to Paris today?
No. Today I'm with my little man.
My friends are coming over.
You think they're bringing presents.
Don't be self-serving.
Have a good time.
I've engaged a conjurer, all right?
Of course.
Hurry back home!
Goodbye everyone.
Mr. Victor Pegala?
What is this regarding?
I'm not a salesman... or a beggar.
That's not an answer...
The answer is difficult.
If I told you who I am...
you might take it the wrong way.
Tell me anyway.
I am Helen's husband.
I told you...
not to jump to conclusions.
Allow me to be surprised...
Come in.
Please.
Have a seat.
A drink?
I'd Like a whisky.
Scotch or Bourbon?
Bourbon... for a change.
Good choice.
Now, I'll explain. I don't know if...
Please.
Helen must have told you. We don't...
interfere in each other's private lives.
Yet, we're very fond of each other.
We're free of each other... you follow?
In short, we've worked out a plan...
as you must have understood.
We tell each other everything.
She told me of you.
I wanted to meet you.
I'm... very glad about it...
though a little... surprised...
I hadn't thought of you Like that...
but I think it's fine.
Yes... yes... yes.
One is always...
a little doubtful about...
steeping with a married woman.
You don't want trouble...
scandal and so on.
That's how I feel.
But you have reassured me.
Yes, yours is rather a special case.
Helen has lots of affairs... Of course...
not with just anyone.
They usually don't Last...
but you're privileged.
I don't know her... that well.
Two, three weeks.
How did you meet her?
Have you a Light?
I don't smoke because of...
I never smoke in the morning...
By accident... at the cinema...
I sat close to her.
I sensed a sort of...
availability.
You know what I mean. It was...
The movie was awful.
We complained about it together...
We Left together.
To have a drink.
I gave her my address; she came over.
Quite simple.
That's very amusing.
It happens everyday, you know.
So... it's going well.
Excuse me?
You're pleased with her?
Well... er...
Not bad.
Not at all bad.
No complications.
Now I know why.
You haven't developed her sense of guilt.
No, that's true.
She's a good kid.
Married 11 years...
We have a son.
I know, I know. She told me.
Another drink?
Thanks, I will?
You're Lucky to...
have organized your Life...
I was married to a bitch.
A real horror... unbelievable.
I don't doubt it.
Know what I Like about Helen?
Her softness.
She doesn't Look it but...
she's very sweet...
and tender.
Unbelievable.
You commute?
To Versailles.
Isn't it a drag coming to Paris?
You get used to it.
I'll tell you something you may ignore.
It's a nightmare for Helen.
You sure about that.
Absolutely... she's made for Paris.
She wanted to Live in Versailles.
Really? She said it was your idea.
You talk about me frequently?
Very Little. We...
avoid the subject.
My advice; you should Live in Paris.
Look around, it's practically the country.
How many rooms have you?
It's not very big.
This living room...
a small bedroom...
a beautiful bathroom...
kitchen, cupboards and so on...
Like to Look around?
Very much. It will help me to imagine...
Pervert?
No, just amused.
Well, this way.
Here's the bedroom.
You see... it's not huge.
About Helen...
I really Like her a Lot.
Don't think I'm in Love.
I find it difficult to fall in Love.
I think...
What is it?
Recognize it?
Helen gave it to me.
She said you'd forgotten it.
Why give it to you?
I don't have the slightest idea.
To give herself pleasure?
Why did you give it to her?
For our third wedding anniversary.
We were living in Paris...
She chose it.
Come on. Over here.
I can't go on.
What did you say?
Excuse me... I'm not feeling well.
What's come over you.
Is it the Whisky?
You're not used to it.
It'll pass.
Would you Like an Aspro.
No thanks.
You Look awful.
Yes. I know.
Why did you stop?
Sorry. Let's exchange addresses.
You were driving too fast.
Mind your own business.
I have full coverage.
I don't have time to stop. I'm in a hurry.
Why are you wasting my time?
Any damage?
No, no damage.
What about your trunk?
It's stuck.
Nothing... it's just sheet metal.
He doesn't care!
I want a report. Otherwise...
I don't want this to come out of my pocket.
I always pay.
Shut up, everyone!
Put down "damaged trunk". That's all.
Pay attention!
No. Move on there... move on!
That'll do then.
Pity you weren't there to...
see them eat!
Unfortunately, someone ran into me.
You're Looking very pale.
How about a drink?
I'll get myself a whisky...
Mrs. Thomas' son is Michel's best friend.
He's adorable.
Not always. He doesn't study Like yours.
In a month or two it will be the opposite.
Is my husband still here?
Yes, Madam.
Well, what a surprise.
Haven't seen you in at Least eight days.
Can we go?
Of course, darling.
Had a good day?
Yes, but a tiring one.
I'm completely worn out.
We can go. I've finished.
You're Late, dad.
Wait for me...
I'll be there in two minutes.
I'll be Late.
I'll take you in the car.
It's just around the corner.
So Long.
No egg.
Just some tea.
How's the headache.
It's gone?
It's gone.
Not going to Paris today?
No... I think I'll have a rest here.
That won't do you any harm.
You don't want any toast?
I don't have much of an appetite.
Madam, I need some money.
Come to my room.
Calves's Liver for Lunch?
Do what you want. I'm not hungry.
I'll do Liver.
It's very healthy and easy to eat.
Very well, Liver then.
Madam, may I come in?
Two gentlemen to see you.
To see me?
What do they want?
I'm tired.
Police, Madam.
Police?
Why?
I don't know.
I told them I'd tell you.
Tell them I'll come down.
Sorry to disturb you.
I'm Inspector Duval.
My assistant... Gobet.
Sorry for the confusion, but I'm ill...
and resting.
I apologize for disturbing you, Madam.
We'll try to be as brief as possible.
Come this way, please.
Sit down, please.
I'll come directly to the point.
You know Victor Pegala?
Well, yes... a Little.
Why do you ask? No idea.
Do you know where he can be found?
I don't know... at his house?
Do you know his address?
He Lives in Neuilly, right?
We found your name, address, telephone...
In Pegala's address book.
We're making enquiries...
among the names here...
to find out where Mr. Pegala is.
I don't understand.
What has he done?
He should have met his former wife...
to pay alimony,
arrange vacation with the kids.
He didn't turn up.
Mrs. Ex-Pegala became concerned...
went to his flat... no answer.
She phoned several times...
day and night... no reply.
You know her?
Not at all.
She knows what she wants.
She came to see.
But I won't worry you...
Just a few questions...
When did you see pegala...
for the Last time?
I can't remember.
Yes, I understand.
Sorry we had to trouble you...
Especially since you're not well.
We're making progress...
in our hit and miss way, you know.
Well, I won't keep you now.
If ever... you never know... you should...
have any news, Let me know...
at Police Headquarters.
Inspector Duval...
or Gobet.
You think something
happened to Mr. Pegala?
This is just a routine inquiry.
There is possibly a question of murder.
But they always say I'm a pessimist.
Sorry to be a nuisance.
There's daddy.
How is it going?
I can't find that piece.
How do you feel?
Better now.
You want a drink?
Yes. Don't bother.
Know who were here? Police.
Nothing important but...
What did they ask?
A disappearance.
You don't know him. Victor Pegala.
I don't know him.
A writer...
I've forgotten where I met him.
Do you want a drink?
No, thanks.
My name was in his diary.
I wonder why they interrogated you.
My name is in his address book.
Ah... incriminating!
Nonsense!
I'll see about dinner.
Help me, daddy.
How is it I can't find this bit?
I don't know, my son.
I've tried every piece.
Maybe it's missing?
Maybe.
You're being a nuisance...
Enough about this.
We have to talk about something.
Shut up.
I have to fire Brigit.
Oh, really. Why?
Since her affair with Paul,
she's impossible.
Obviously.
He's annoying because of this.
Always at it.
Well, he has other qualities.
Why should anyone just disappear?
This man who disappeared.
It's not normal.
It has to happen from time to time.
Someone disappeared?
The piece to your puzzle.
That's the one.
It's impossible.
Yes, it's possible. Here's proof.
It's nowhere.
Calm down.
You hid it.
I'm sure you did.
- No, I didn't hide it.
- You did, you bastard.
You're calling me a bastard?
Are you mad?
You hid it.
Go to bed immediately.
I'm fed up with your puzzle!
Off to bed.
You're both crazy.
I hate you.
What's that?
I don't know.
The two gentlemen from this afternoon.
Ask them in.
Sorry to disturb you again.
At such a Late hour.
I don't know what to say.
My husband.
Good evening, Sir.
Inspector Duval and Gobet.
My son... off to bed.
I had to come and see you
to clear up a few points.
And I think one of you will help us.
Excuse me.
Do you know Mr. Pegala, sir?
No. My wife told me about your visit.
I don't know him.
Fine.
I must ask you
to make an effort to remember...
where you met Mr. Pegala.
I've told you...
I don't remember.
Try hard, Madam.
I don't know.
A cocktail party.
Which?
I don't know... Julliard?
I'm saying Julliard, but I don't know.
I've told you...
I don't remember.
I understand it's difficult, Madam.
Were you at this party, Sir?
Yes. I was. Yes.
You could've met Mr. Pegala.
I don't think so. The name means
nothing...
What about his face. I have a picture.
No... his face reminds me of nothing.
Just to be sure. It's him?
Yes, that's him.
Ever go to his flat?
No... I hardily knew him.
I don't even know why he had my address.
Perhaps... he Liked you?
Perhaps.
Inspector, I don't want to sound rude.
But this sort of questioning...
is rather unpleasant.
I don't want to get in your way,
but it's nearly 10.
Yes, you're quite right to tell me...
but this sort of disappearance...
forces us to Look everywhere.
Ever been to Neuilly?
Why Neuilly?
To Mr. Pegala's, I mean.
I don't even know where he Lives.
Yes, I know.
Sir, you know nothing.
Doesn't make it easier.
I'm sorry...
but what can I do about it?
Well, I won't keep you any Longer.
I know you are doing your job.
This sort of business
makes our job unpleasant.
I'll show you out.
I hope I'll not have to come again...
but I can't even promise that.
Goodbye, Inspector.
I've put it right.
Look. Forgive me?
I Love you!
Those two men again.
I'll see what they want.
I Love you.
I Love you.
I Love you Like mad.
