You little maggot piece of shit.
You're going to regret this.

do you think you are?

Me?
I'm just another chunk of meat...
lost in brainland.
Oh, shit.
Don't you dare to do that.
Put it down.
I said, "put it down".
You're fired!

'Edward, can you come in for a moment?'
Yes?

(Secretary) 'Sir, I have
a Milan Milanovich on the line.
'Will you take the call, sir?'
No. Er...
I'll call him back later.
Edward, I've been asked to lend you
to another department.
You'll get your instructions from, er...
from this fine, young man.
Er... Samuel Campbell.
(Phone ringing)
That's great.
(Man on TV)
'It's molesting time.'
Oh, I'm Sam Campbell.
Welcome to the team.
Have a seat.
So, this is the Splatter and Gore
Department.
Yes, it is. But right now, I'd rather call it
the "Loose Limbs" Department.
European distributors have bought
the whole "Loose Limbs" series.
We're planning on showing Part One
all over Europe next spring.
I don't understand.
It's big.
It's real big. It is huge.
It's a $100 million deal.
- But why have you...
- I personally think it's sad and very wrong.
But as you know, of course,
there is legislation in some
of the European countries
that forces us to cut down a bit
on the violence in these films.
- You want me to...
- We're running a very tight schedule here.
I need all the extra resources I can get.
I want you to get started
as soon as possible.
- Let's say...
- (Man on TV) 'God, you're bleeding bad!
'Would you like me
to cut off the other one, too?'
On Monday?
Are you sure I'm really qualified
for this kind of work?
- You're just the man I need, Eddie.
- (Woman on TV screaming)
You're perfect.
I have a little house just outside town.
Since we are just a tad
short of space here,
I've arranged for you to work there.
It is a little inconvenient,
but you'll manage, right?
And remember, like we say here
at Splatter and Gore Department,
you keep 'em heads rollin', hear?
(Woman on TV screaming)
(Woman on TV sobbing)

European Distributors,
Edward Tor Swenson.
- (Woman) 'Hi, darling.'
- Hello, Barbara.
'So how's work going?
I... I'm not interrupting you, am I?'
Nah, it's OK.
'You never talk about work.
Is it that awful?'
- No.
- 'Tell me.'
No, trust me, honey,
you don't want to know.
- 'Yes, I do.'
- Believe...
'Edward, I'm not a child,
so don't treat me like one, OK?'
OK.
In this film, there's a scene
where a woman gets raped by a beaver
and then shot in the head
with a bazooka.
'Oh, Edward, that's disgusting.
- 'I can't believe you're telling me this.'
- Honey...
'Well, it's awful. A beaver?
It's perverted.'
Honey, I'm doing it
for a good cause.
'I know.
And I love you for that.
- 'Of course, I love you anyway.'
- I love you, too.
'And you won't forget about
Emmy's birthday party next Sunday?'
No, no, I won't forget.
- 'Promise?'
- I promise.
- 'Are you sure?'
- I'll be there.
- 'And I thought we could start at 5.'
- Yeah, 5pm.
- 'Don't be late.'
- Sharp.
- 'Take care now.'
- OK.
- 'And don't work too hard. Love you.'
- I love you, too.
'Bye.'
Come on, hon,
show me what you got.
Do you like what you see, darling?
(Retches) Well, yeah.
Do you like my body, baby?
Yeah, I... I want your body.
Come on, baby.
You can have it.
Well, not all of it.
I think I'll settle for an arm.
"An arm"?

Hi. Hi, honey.
(Screaming on screen continues)
- Hi, baby, what's up?
- Not much. What are you guys watching?
"Loose Limbs 5".
Yeah!
Really, Nick,
can I ask you something?
Do you always have to watch
these kind of films?
Nah, I'm not all fucked up...
“Vet.
(Growling)
Stop it, Nick. Nick, stop it.
Nick, stop it. Who do you think you are?
Hannibal the Cannibal?
(Nick growls, Mel chuckles)
Thank you.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
(Screaming on screen continues)
Hey, Nick, where are you?
Hmm... here, Mr Campbell.
I hired a new editor
for the "Loose Limbs" series.
I think he's pretty well set up
for a while.
But I want you... yeah, you
to be responsible for delivering new films
when he needs them.
Sure thing, Mr Campbell.
- Whoa.
- Damn.
- (Sam) Hey, Nick.
- Yes, Mr Campbell?
Don't you screw it up.
No, Mr Campbell.

Why is "Loose Limbs 8" in my office
when it should be with Eddie?
Number 8?
Urn, that's because, urn...
...er, I forgot.
You are a piece of shit.
- Yes, sir.
- You'd better go now.
Yes, sir.
Any. . -
Are there any messages for me,
Melanie?
Oh, no, no. I'm sorry, sir.
There's no messages for you today.
- Yuck.
- My God, he's so disgusting, you know?
- I'm so glad he's not my boss.
- Well, he's mine.
The way he's pushing me around
from morning till evening, you know?
Like every fucking day, you know?
I can't believe this.
The way he walks in - he stares,
and he's really disgusting, you know?
And he smells so awful.
And he smokes a lot.
- Uh-huh.
- I can't believe he treats you this way.
(Man on TV screams)
(Monster on TV)
'Come on, punk. Make my day.'
- (Gunshot)
- Oh, hi, Eddie.
Come on in, come on in.
So, Eddie, what's your problem?
I... I don't feel so good.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I'm not sure if this job...
the violence, or the blood...
I don't know if I'm able
to continue with...
Well, Edward, neither do I.
So you tell me.
I want my old job back.
These films,
they give me the creeps.
Don't forget your appointment at 10,
Mr Campbell.
I won't, honey.
(Man on TV choking)
Edward...
I think it's important that you and I
are open and honest with each other.
You see,
I'm not your mother or shrink.
I'm your boss.
I don't need to know
your emotional state of mind.
What I need is results,
Edward, results.
And if you can't give me those results,
you tell me, hear?
Because if not,
I'll have you fired.
- But Mr Campbell, you can't mean that...
- Nice talking to you, Edward.
Have a nice day.
Mr Campbell...

'Are you OK?'
I think I maybe should be taken
to a hospital.
Uh-huh.
What's wrong?
Are you feeling ill, homesick?
I don't know.
Don't worry.
It'll probably pass.
Great. Look...
Give me a break, will you?
I'm coming out
to visit you tomorrow.
You know?
I want to check things out.
Sure.
It's your world.
I just live in it.
'See you tomorrow then, Eddie.'
(Eddie) My God,
what's happening to me?
(I Romantic music playing)
(I Music stops abruptly)
(Crow caws)
Hi, I'm from European.
Nick.
You brought "Loose Limbs 7"?
Yeah, sure did.
Huh... Great movie.
"Great movie"?
9O minutes of condensed
sex and violence -
do you call that a great movie?
Do you have the slightest idea of
what a moral and ethical principle is?
Hey, man, relax.
You shouldn't take things too seriously.
- I'm perfectly relaxed.
- (Pencil snaps)
Now, give me that film
and get the hell out of here.

(Scream)
(Roaring)
(Baby crying)
I'm still waiting.
I don't understand.
Waiting for what?
For you to prove yourself.
You've got such potential.
It would be a real waste
if you didn't put it to use.
The whole world
needs to be corrected.
There's much work to be done.
I trust you'll be happy
to do your part.
I try to do my best.
Yes, I know about your work.
And let me be honest -
I'm far from pleased.
You know what's shown on the screen
is a mere reflection
of s0me0ne's ungodly, sick mind.
You have to remove these minds
or else nothing is won.
Just remember
not to expect any gratitude.
Look what they did to me.
And all I wanted was
to free them from evil.
(Laughs)
"Them"?
You know, them.
Yeah, I guess so.
Come closer.
Don't be afraid.
(Breathes heavily)
You have a wonderful face.
So noble and so clean.
You know, don't you,
that they will have to adjust?
They must be corrected or die.

(Knock on door)
Hi.
It is you, Eddie?
Always nice
with a warm welcome.
I hope it wasn't meant
to keep me out.
You have some strange neighbours.
- One of them got into the house last night.
- Yes, what happened?
It was a fight.
I scared him off.
And now you're shutting up the house
in order to keep him out, eh?
I love that, Edward.
I sure do. I like a man who ain't afraid
of taking radical action.
So, how are you getting on
with your work?
- Good.
- I want to see it.
Yes, of course, go right ahead.
(Creature babbles)
(Sam) Eddie?
Eddie?
Are you coming?
(Creature) Bye-bye-
(Woman on TV screams)
(Man on TV) 'Molesting time.'
Listen...
Sam calling Edward.
Come in, Edward.
Now, get that neighbour shit
out of your head.
We have some
serious business to discuss.
I'm listening.
I want you to answer
a simple question.
Can you do that for me?
Then tell me this:
Where in the fuck
is my beaver rape scene?
It's out, of course.
Are you nuts?
That scene's worth a fortune.
Oh, my God.
This guy's a couple of cans
short of a six pack.
There was no sexually explicit
footage in that scene.
No tits, no cocks, no pussy,
no obscene body movements.
Get it?
Read my lips, not X-rated.
- But it's... it's a disgusting scene.
- Make a note.
"Beaver rape clip stays in the film."
(Woman on TV screams)
I like you, Eddie.
I really do.
You're a nice guy.
You want to do the right thing, only...
(Distorted voice) ...the right thing is wrong,
as long as you work for me.
You hear what I'm saying to you?
(Gasps)
(Normal voice) Eddie?
Eddie?
(Distorted voice)
What the fuck are you whining about?
No!
Eddie?
(Footsteps)
You spineless little sissy.
Come on, race me to hell.
(Gasps)
(Growling)
Evil has shown itself to you.
Now, you must fight it.
Let go of your fear.
I'll guide you.
I'll show you
the true beauty of hatred.
Eddie!
We who dwell in darkness know
the most sadness and grief, don't we?
Being is hurting.
So my friend,
I grant you a favour.
You will eat pussy in hell
for the rest of eternity.
(Laughs)
I want us to be real close.
Don't you fucking look at me.

this is an excellent opportunity
to save a taxpayer's money.
Move!
(Mel) Nick!
No.
(crying)
(Grunts)
(Growling)
(Screaming)
Move.
Goodbye, dude.
(Groans)
Move.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's a fucking war going on up there.
- Let me through. I got to get up.
- No one gets up there, no one.
- Nobody.
- Man, let me through. I got to get up.
No, no, no... Nobody gets the fuck
up there. Nobody.
My girlfriend's up there.
Damn.
Nobody.
Nobody gets the fuck up there.
Come on out of there.
Come on out of there,
you sick son of a bitch.
Come on out.
Come on out.
Fight like a man.
(Screams)
Nice shot.
Ouch.
Soon, my love, soon.
(Grunts)
(Growls)
(Demon) You had
such potential, Edward,
but you proved yourself wrong.
But I did everything
you told me to, didn't I?
(Demon) Search.
The truth lies within you.
(Growling)
You tried your best.
But now you have to pay
for your failures. (Growls)
Stay away from me.
(Gunshot)
(Eddie screams)
Rest in pieces, motherfucker.
(Nick) 'An empty feeling came over me
when I lowered the gun.
'Strange.
'After all, Mel was
amazingly still alive.
'And yet, it had been
a bad and violent day.
'As I watched Mel lying there,
'purity and innocence personified,
'it all suddenly became clear to me.
'Someday the world will be
a kinder place for everybody.
'For the children,
for the little puppies,
'and for everything soft,
cuddly, and wonderful.
'Someday,
love will rule the world.
'It will happen.
'Oh, yes, it will happen.'
