So it's done then?
We were fooling ourselves...
It was a mistake.
Don't say that.
Don't call it a mistake.
We've already been through it.
There's really nothing more
to say.
I tried though.
You at least know
that much, don't you?
I know, David.
I know.
And what about this place?
We got it for the season.
You're the one who wanted to come
out here, for Christ's sake.
Picked up most of it on my way.
This should last you a while.
Thanks for coming by.
I know it's a long way.
Ah, it's nothing.
I was glad you called.
Anyway, I like the drive.
The city can get
a bit overwhelming.
It's quiet out here.
There's some other houses,
but...
I haven't seen
anyone else around.
It's what draws people out here
in the first place.
The isolation.
I personally never understood
the appeal of it...
It's there... for some.
Another thing I'm having
a hard time with
is all this light.
It never seems to get dark
out here.
Can't get used to it.
I actually quite like it.
It's easier to get work done.
Yeah, but there's no sense
of time.
And it's much harder to sleep.
It's a shame about Eva,
really it is.
But...
Well, you know
how these things go by now.
It'll take some time.
Always does.
The shitty thing is...
it's a routine I'm getting
a little too used to.
I don't have a fucking clue
what happened.
You know when we first
started off...
everything was perfect.
Then when she left yesterday...
I knew there was nothing I
could do to change her mind.
It's like she was just
stuck on it.
Yeah but you can't
dwell on all that.
Replaying all these
conversations in your head...
wondering...
it'll drive you crazy.
You remember how it was
with me and Alma?
It took me almost a year
to get back to normal.
Yeah but that whole thing was
fucked from the start.
Yeah, probably.
So what're you gonna do
with this place?
Well, I spoke to the owner
this morning.
I'll stay the weekend and see if he
can find someone else to rent it.
Why not stick around for a bit?
You still have
the photo assignment.
I'd rather stay in town,
commute from there.
Just make a few day trips
and get the photos that way.
It would be much easier
to do it just from here.
I don't know...
I wouldn't really
be able to concentrate.
Bad memories, I guess.

Most of her family
resides in Sweden.
But she hadn't been in touch
with them for quite some time.
As for the note, I can't really
disclose that information.
I'm sure you understand.
Beautiful girl, wasn't she?
Such a shame.
I wonder what she was doing
out here...
all alone...
You mind if I keep this?
Sure... I've got copies
at the station.
Um, look...
I know we've already
kept you here a week, but...
I'm afraid I'll have to ask
one more thing of you.
What's that?
I was wondering
if you can extend your stay
until the investigation
is concluded.
Still a few things
we have to clear up.
Investigation?
Thought you said
it was a suicide.
Yeah, well there are procedures
we have to follow.
Still have to wait
for the toxicology report
to determine the final
cause of death.
How much longer

These things can take time
out here.
But, uh, shouldn't be more

She was all bloated up...
her skin was pale white.

there's barely anyone

The detective wouldn't really
let on about anything either.
Well, there's not much

She must've been depressed.

I don't know.
The whole thing's just fucked.
It's tragic... is what it is.
How much longer do they
want you to stay?
A few days.
At least that's what he said.
That's good,
because the office is
sending me out to the states.
I'll be in New York.
You're being transferred?
No, it's nothing permanent.
Just for a couple weeks to help
them get the new branch in order.
Just last minute thing.
You know, I was thinking...
The world must be trying to tell
me something with this trip.
First Eva...
now this.
Well look at it this way,
at least it can't get any worse.
Marie?
Marie, are you up there?
No.
Can I have one of those?

Von Fleischer.
You're quite fond of him

Always playing this music.

Now I do.

Yeah, I've got a cabin

Oh, then I'm surprised
we haven't run into you yet.
We really live just up the way.
How long are you staying for?
I'm not actually sure yet.

Hi. Nice to meet you.
Jóhann. It's a pleasure.
Sorry, this is all

I didn't have time

Come.
Everyone, this is David.
- Hi, David.
- Alex, nice to meet you.

- Like some wine, David?
- Oh, thank you.
- Marie?
- Thank you.
Cheers.

- Cheers.
It's a strange place to settle
for the season.
It must get so lonely out here.
To be completely honest,
I didn't come out here alone.
- Oh, no.
- It's not the best situation.
I'm trying to make
the most of it.
But I did come out here
for a work assignment,
so that'll keep me busy.
Work assignment?
You'll be taking photos?
Have you ever heard
of Andrew Franke?
He's an American author. He
used to write here in Iceland.
I'm taking some pictures for
a new project he's working on.
So you'll be here
for a while, then?
I don't know.
It depends on a few
different things actually.
It's no the worst place
to end up.
How're you enjoying yourself,
David?
- He's bored sick.
- No, no. This is great.
I'm glad I decided
to go shooting today.
Otherwise I wouldn't
have met Marie.
Well, that makes the both of us.
Why don't I show you around?
Marie is always the one in charge
of these little house parties,
if you couldn't guess
by the crowd out there.
I always feel so out of place
with her friends.
It's not that I mind their age,
but...
they can be
a fucking superficial lot.
Though I must say,
I saw a bit of a kindred spirit
in you.
"Kindred spirits?"
Is that sort of like
love at first sight?
Marie tells me
that you're a photographer.
Yeah, well it's created a lot
of great opportunities for me.
Is that how you ended up
in Iceland?
Well partly.
I do most of my work in Europe.
I do a bit
of photography myself.
I started when I was in college.
It was a particularly
happy time in my life
so I became obsessed
with documenting it all.
These are actually really good.
It's just a few of my favorites
of my own work.
I've collected
thousands of prints.
Each marked off by category.
That's from when we met.
She's beautiful.
That's what makes her
so unreachable.
What do you mean?
Marie, like most
beautiful women,
is very self-aware.
Women like her, they have
the power to dominate.
Each whim answered.
Each affection celebrated.
I've known women like that.
I do love her.
Deeply.
That's the worst part
of it all, I think.
You know, there was a drowning
here last week.
Though from what I'm hearing,
it seems...
more like it was a suicide.
I was there...
What?
Well, not when it happened.
I'm the one who found her.
Christ.
- I didn't really want to mention it out there.
- No, of course.
That's a terrible thing
to have to go through.
Did you know the woman who died?
Elisa?
No, not in any real way.
I had met her a few times.
Tragic woman, really.
That much I could sense
even before she died.
Well it was a suicide.
The police have asked me to stay
until they finish the investigation.
Or at least that's
what they told me.
It makes sense.
I wouldn't stress about it.
So what are you doing
after the season?
Going back to Reykjavik?
No, I'll probably go
for a holiday soon.
You're always off somewhere.
Don't you get sick of it?
Oh god, no, no.
And anyway, I promised my sister
to go back to Rome
for a few weeks.
And Jóhann can take
that much time off?
Jóhann won't be joining me.
We need a little break from
each other every now and then.
It's the only way it works
with us.
Hey, where did you disappear to?
Jóhann was just
showing me around.
You've got a beautiful home.
I'm really glad he likes you.
He typically doesn't like
any of my friends.
What about me?
Oh, he loves you.
But then, so does everybody.
Isn't she such a beauty?
You know, it's sort of
a strange phenomenon, actually.
- In what sense?
- Well think about it.
Most relationships, outside
of family, are transient.
Oh, I don't believe that.
How many actual relationships have
you maintained throughout your life?
And I'm not just talking about people
you email with every now and then.
But I don't get this notion
of relationships.
When you're friends
with someone,
you don't have to be in
constant contact with them.
It's more just knowing they're
out there when you need them.
But then what does
that friendship amount to?
It's so trivial.
David, I think you're a bit
too attached to people.
Maybe you expect too much.
You're probably right.
I do tend to think
about other people too much.
And what about them?
Are they thinking about you?
The woman on the news.
The one they found on the beach.
Did you two happen to know her?
Must've seen her around.
Excuse me.
Horrible way to go.
Yeah.
You all right?
When you called I was a bit
confused, to be honest.
Confused about what?
I've heard stories, you know...
back in Reykjavik.
What stories?
Don't play dumb.
Okay...
you heard stories.
I'm sorry about that...
but I don't really know
what you expect from me.
Nothing...
Nothing...
You know, it took us
almost two hours to get here.
That's a long way to come.
Don't you think?

You can say it's a disease or...
an accident or a heart
attack, or what have you,

they die because
they can't go on living.

David...
how nice to see you.
I'd call Marie down
but she's asleep.
She hasn't been feeling well.
She's just a bit tired.
How are the photos coming along?
They're coming...
It must be... difficult...
after what you went through,
finding Elisa like that.
It's almost like I keep expecting
bad things to happen...
every time I go out.
I don't know
how to explain it...
It's a traumatic thing

Most people would've just
quit the job.
I have this portrait of her.
A portrait?
Yes.
They found it in her house.
It's this beautiful
black and white photo...

image out of my mind, you know?
It's normal.
Have the police gotten
back in touch with you?
No. Not yet.
I think I'll have to
stay for a bit longer.
At least until
the investigation is over.
Well...
they're not the most
competent police force.
I wanted to ask you...
did you get a chance to speak
to Marie much at the party?
Yeah... I mean, for a bit.
She... she was busy
playing host.
Why?
She hasn't been herself lately.
What do you mean?
It's been tough on her,
being away from Rome.
When we're in the city,
she's not as restless,
but out here she doesn't seem
to be handling it very well.
It's gotta be hard,
living as a foreigner out here.
Not everyone's suited
for the quiet.
Part of the reason we spend
so much time out here
is because of all
the distractions in Reykjavik.
It's a decent compromise,
I think.
Especially given the amount
of freedom I give her.
But now, she spends large parts
of the day on the phone...
speaking in Italian.
And you know... I don't ask.
Ever.
You don't ask.
It gets to a point when you
ask yourself, which is worse.
Not knowing, or the alternative?
Maybe that's
part of the problem.
We must seem so strange to you.
No.
I'm not one to judge.
I had things fall apart with Eva
the week after we got out here.
And you were with her a while?
No...
and that's the fucking sad part.
I get my hopes up too easily.
Well...
at least you're not
too sentimental about it.
Or you don't seem to be.
At times, maybe.
You get hit
with so many disappointments...
after a while
it makes you wonder...
You want to know something
I learned a long time ago?
What's that?
The only things we can depend on
are ourselves
and our unhappiness.
These are my...
Joyous words of wisdom.

What, you're not impressed?
Don't.

Always being on the move.

It's like...
being deprived of something.
Of culture.
I've been meaning to ask you,
you and Marie,
how'd you meet?
You two seem close.
We met in Reykjavik, a year ago,
after she married Jóhann.
They have a house there as well.
Her and Jóhann...
Seems like
kind of an odd pairing.
Why?
Because of his age?
No, no, it's just...
Look at the way
she was at the party.
They barely even spoke.
That's how she is.
Jóhann's always there
to give her attention.
Why not get it from others
when they're around?
That seems selfish.
That's because it is.
Marie has a hard time seeing things
from other people's perspective.
I'm sure it's tough on Jóhann.
It would be for anyone.
And that doesn't affect
your view on her at all?
She's my friend and I really
don't wish to judge.
I find that so boring.
Well I guess there
is something about her...
draws you in...
If you're so curious
about Marie,
then why don't you
go over there?
She's probably still awake.
Don't do that.
What?
So quick to assume trouble.
So quick...
Blame it on bad experiences,
I guess.
And the fact that I can
never say what I'm thinking.
That's a problem.
Maybe you should talk
to someone about that.
Isn't that what we're doing now?
You know I really do love
how quiet it is out here.
So much more peaceful
than the city.
I'd like to have
a place like this.
You'd still have to hold
on to your place in the city.
Why's that?
Because you'd get lonely.
You seem to be doing all right.
For now...
I have to go away for a while.
I got a call form Vienna.
Paul's in the hospital.
The hospital?
He's gotten worse.

It's just best

I fly out tomorrow.
He's been a good friend to you.
It'll be good for you

How long will you be gone for?
A few days... maybe a week.

Wouldn't it be better

someone has something nice
to say about me for a change.
I was on holiday in Santorini
with my family.
I was still only twenty,
and he was this handsome,
successful guy.
And charming, so charming.
That was the thing with Jóhann,
he would make you feel like you were the
most interesting person in the room.
So you've been with him
since then?
No, no.
We didn't end up
seeing each other
for a few years after that.
And at first,
I was so heartbroken.
You know, when I thought of him,
I would have tears in my eyes.
And I never felt like that
with any other guy.
But then a year ago,
he was in Rome and we knew.
So six months later
we were married.
That's quick.
You think so?
I never understood
waiting so long.
Once you know, you know.

time is because things change.
People change.
Why didn't we do this sooner?

This. Dinner.

Yeah, but I barely

Melancholia.
What?
That's the word for it.
There was a boy, Francois...
This was when I was 15.
He was a bit older, 19 or so.
But we were so in love.
When I met him,
I thought I would marry him.
Have a family with him.
And all this, I felt so quickly.
When I was young,
I would always be like this.
Getting attached so easily.
But with Francois...
I really thought
he was the one for me.
So what happened?
Right when we started dating,
we fucked...
and I didn't like it.
It wasn't good for me.
And so after that,
I stopped talking to him.
And he would call and call...
but for weeks I wouldn't answer.
But then after that, I felt bad, so
I met him at his friend's house.
I told him the truth,
and he couldn't believe it.
My god...
I still remember
the look on his face.
He was so in love with me...
he asked me for a second chance,
but I didn't want to.
After the first time, I knew.
I think you should've have
given him a second chance.
But I didn't want him anymore.
I just would've hurt him even
more if we stayed together.
You said you've made
a lot of mistakes with guys.
So many...
When those happened...
did you ever think
about the guys you said no to?
The guys like Francois?
I mean...
you break the guy's heart,
reject him,
and then you go slumming it
with some random guy.
That's a bit cruel, isn't it?
Not shocking...
Maybe a bit disappointing.
Why is it the same?

You have a short temper, Marie.
Has anyone ever told you that?
Jóhann is coming back tomorrow.
It's going to be harder
to see you.
I know.
How much longer
are you staying for?
A week...
Maybe a bit longer.
So we've still got time.
I know you won't believe me,
but...
I will be sad to see you go.
The past few days
have been really great.
Never.
Then let's just enjoy the time
we have left.
Amore mio.
I've missed you so much.
Marie.
Paul was in such bad shape.
When I went to see him
he had all these tubes
hooked into him.
Apparatuses allowing him
to breath.
Did he know you were there?
Yes, yes.
They woke him up eventually
and we spoke.
What did he say?
Nothing meaningful.
I don't think he knew
who I was, to be honest.
But that wasn't
the upsetting part.
That night,
when I got back to the hotel,
I kept thinking about him.
All the people we knew.
The time we spent together.
He didn't remember any of it.
It was like it never happened.
And I started to weep.
Like some child.
I didn't know why.
So strange isn't it?
There I was,
filled with
this unbearable sadness.
Don't dwell on it, my love.
I wish you'd come by more.
I haven't seen you
since he came back.
I told you
it would be difficult.
I know, it's just...
I think about how it was...
things you said.
That was only a week ago, Marie.
Has it really changed that much?
I wish you wouldn't
be like this...
You know what my situation is,
and...
And, I never
promised you anything.
You should try taking responsibility
for yourself some time.
You say things...
maybe you mean them...
maybe you don't.
Why not just be clear about it?
What's so hard about that?
That's funny, coming from you.
It's a joke, is what it is.
♪
Liv.
Glass of wine.
Everything's been going well.
Finished up the assignment,
so that'll keep my agent happy.
For now, at least.
And you've been keeping
yourself entertained...
otherwise?
Look...
I know I don't come out
looking too great here.
I know you and Marie are close.
Of course,
that doesn't bother her.
It never has.
She's not totally at fault here.
At fault for what?
David...
you're acting like you
did something wrong.
I could see it being an issue
if we were teenagers.
But we're not.
I took it out this morning,
going through old photos.
Did you see Marie much
while I was gone?
Marie?
No, not really.
I was busy
finishing up the photos.
I've noticed a huge change
in her.
She seems to be coming to life.
I'm glad to hear that.
You took this.
That's how I knew her.
I photographed her
about a year ago.
I thought...
You know I... got this photo
from the police.
They said she had it
in her house.
That's right...
I remember you mentioning
something about a portrait.
I didn't make the connection.
Such a sad thing she was.
One of those kind of nights,
hey?
What?
You know David, I was thinking
about what you said
the other day, you know,
and I think
it's quite interesting
about how you put it,
relationships being transient,
and when I came home, I started
thinking about my response,
and I realized, David, I wasn't
quite honest with myself...
Sorry, I'll be right back.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Sure, but Alex was just
telling me about this hotel
he's working on in Berlin
and it really sounds amazing.
Well, it's still a while off
but we've got high hopes for it.
Can we go,
maybe have a cigarette?
Can it wait 'til after dinner? I just
didn't get a chance to talk to everybody.
Sure, okay, that's fine.
Hey, man.
I'm stuffed.
I always love a cigarette
after dinner.
Cleans the palette.
So Liv was telling me
she came out to see you.
Yeah? She told you?
I'm impressed.
About what?
It's nothing, it's just...
I tried to get in her pants
a couple of times.
She's a tough one.
Not like Marie.
Jóhann really is clueless.
Marie does what she wants,
with whoever she wants.
So you fucked her then?
That's what you're saying,
right?
That you fucked her.
- Hey, man.
- Go on, say it!
- Hey man, what the fuck is your problem?
Hey, hey, hey!
What the hell is going on?
- This guy's fucking drunk!
- Fuck you.
Okay, okay.
Enough guys.
No one inside
has heard anything but...
David, David!
Sorry... I was just getting up.
You don't look so well.
Look...
about last night...
I'm sorry I went off like that.
I never cared much for Alex...
and anyways...
he probably had it coming.
But that's not why I'm here.
I came by because...
there's somewhere
I've been meaning to show you.
When I was growing up...
I would go hunting
with my father.
My grandfather too, sometimes.
But now... it's illegal
to hunt the wildlife out here.
So instead... I set up targets.
For me, it was never
about killing the animal.
I was a bit timid
when it came to that, anyway.
I was more interested in just...
Being in the wilderness.
It was one of the few occasions I
would get to be alone with my father,
so I would spend my time
just paying attention to him.
Seeing how he would act.
My whole life,
that man was a stranger to me.
Most of what I know of him comes
from just observing him out here.
It's a shame, really.
I wasn't sure
about you and Marie, at first.
I had my suspicions, of course.
But it wasn't until last night
that I was certain.
The way you lashed out
at Alex...
I don't know
what you think you know...
Please, David.
Don't insult me.
What was it?
Did she tell you
that you were special?
That you're the only one
she can talk to?
Be open with?
You see...
I know the kind
of girl Marie is.
I've always known it.
I'm not so vain
to think I could change her.
But that doesn't mean
I love her any less.
I didn't mean for it to happen
this way.
It wasn't something I planned.
I am sorry, Jóhann.
If that means anything.
I lied to you.
What?
Or, at least I didn't tell you
the whole truth.
I was seeing Elisa, on and off,
for the last two seasons
I've been out here.
She had notions
of how things were...
her place in my life...
I knew that she was struggling
with depression.
I even had a feeling that
something might happen to her,
yet...
yet I did nothing.
I felt a bit guilty at first...
but then I realized...
if I was being honest
with myself...
I know that she never
meant anything to me.
Just like you don't
mean anything to Marie.
I just got everything packed in.
So where are you headed to next?
I have to go see the publisher
in London,
then it's probably New York.
I'm jealous.
Look, David...
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.
About what?
The other night...
It's just...
with everything
that happened last week...
I wasn't being myself.
And it wasn't fair to you,
I know.
So those few days we had...
it was nothing?
You should just forget about me.
Do you really want that?
This whole thing...
you and Jóhann, out here...
I don't understand it.
But what's there to say, right?
It never makes sense
from the outside.
If I asked you to get in
this car with me right now...
what would you say to that?
Things would be better.
You know that's not true...
We know each other now.
We have to stop for the moment,
but that doesn't mean
we can't try again.
You're only a plane ride away...
Come and go as you please,
right?
I've never met anyone
as selfish as you.
That's the problem.
You don't know.
I can't really speak
to the future.
But when I make a choice...
I usually stick to it.
I think this'll be the last
time we see each other, Marie.

Von Fleischer?
I've booked us two tickets
to Madrid, for next week.
I'm getting a bit sick
of Iceland for the moment.
You read my mind.
David left today.
Is that right?
I saw him this morning.
Said goodbye.
You know, I quite liked him.
Interesting guy.
We've weathered some storms,
you and I.
But we always make it through,
don't we?
Why is that?
You know why.
I know...
but I like hearing you say it.
