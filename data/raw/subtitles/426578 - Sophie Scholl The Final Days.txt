Gisela, I have to leave
- What are you doing?
Gisela!
- Oh, I see.
Come on, let's go.
Ok, meet you at the English Park tomorrow at noon.
In front the lake cabin?
Yes, Hans really should give me a call.
- I'll remind him.
- Has he calmed down again?
- You shouldn't have yelled at him like that.
But it'll be ok.
Finally, it was about time.
Hurry, let's go.
Is this all?
That's it. The rest hasn't arrived yet...
"Germans are shocked by soliders who
fell into the abyss of death at Stalingrad
330,000 fellowmen are forced to
death and extermination step by step
by the great genius of our strategists,
meaninglessly and irresponsibly."
Little Sophie, I'm sure Willi would appreciate it
if you could help him.
Here are the stamps.
And the address list.
Thanks.
What happens with the rest?
I'll go deliver them at
the university tomorrow.
Are you crazy? - Willi, at the students uprising
at the German Museum recently,
it nearly happened.
- Gestapo has been on ground alert ever since.
Hans... And our slogans are everywhere!
Hans, we'll hide the rest under the boards
until we get new envelopes.
No need. There is nothing left.
Lack of paper.
It's already pretty dangerous
to write slogans on walls at night...
But handing out flyers at campus
in the middle of the day... Are you crazy?
We have to do somethign now!
We'lll get this city moving!
Especially now, after Stalingrad,
the whole campus is full of snitches!
If the Bolshevists come now,
they'll get all those wimps...
...all at once.
- If I were you if wouldn't be sure
if having the Soviets come before
the Americans is such a good thing.
Don't you hate the Bolshevist the most?
Hans, it is madness!
Don't do it!
I'll go when they are having classes,
nobody will be in the hall...
I'll be out right away.
In from the front, out the back.
- It's too dangerous!
- Willi...
I will take full responsiblity.
It'll be just me.
You are going to walk through Schwabing
with a big suitcase?
I'll take that.
Hans, I don't think we should
have Sophie...
If we are checked,
it'll be easier with a woman.
She is right.
Alright, let's go then.
Alex, meet me in my place
at twelve tomorrow.
So tomorrow? Right away?
- The Nazis won't wait.
Thanks.
Don't work too late.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Dear Lisa,
I'm listening to Schubert's Trout Quintet.
I feel Schubert's inspriation
is flowing in the air.
I can hear the jubilations of the birds
and the whole creation.
The piano repeats the same theme,
like a clear crystal creek
Oh, they make me feel enchanted.
Wish I could hear from you soon.
Best wishes
Yours, Sophie
You think mom might still have some jam?
You only get turnip sirup with food stamps now.
Inconspicuous enough?
Today there's be sparks flying
at the campus. - Yes
Morning!
Morning. - We're going to the neurology clinic.
You want to come along?
Sophie is going to Ulm. I will be there soon, too.
- Come now.
Get out, hurry!
Come on, hurry up!
There are still some in the case, Hans.
- What?
No one's upstairs, wait a second.
- I'm coming along.
Freeze!
Stop!
Stop right now!
You there...Stop right now!
You are under arrest! Stop, damnit!
- What's wrong?
You are under arrest!
That's ridiculous, you can't just arrest us!
You were the only people upstairs. Come here!
- We were at the Psychology Department.
- You were handing out flyers!
- Nonsense!
Let him go!
I threw down those flyers.
I'm going to report you.
You come with me, both of you!
Believe me, even in my college you cannot
get away with stuff like that.
"Stunned - stand the German peoples
before their downfall..."
Come in!
That many? Unbelievable!
Are those all?
- Yes!
You can go now!
Schmid, issue a report.
We will catch them all.
There...there
This student got something...
Give it to me!
Look, another flyer.
Give it to me!
Or you want me to use force?
That's all part of it.
Mohr, national police. Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
These two are under temporary arrest...
And this is the pamphlet.
- I got those two...
Do you have any ID?
Ms. Sophia Magdalena Scholl?
- Yes.
Mr. Hans Fritz Scholl?
- Yes.
Brother and sister?
- Yes.
The weaker sex.
21 years old...
Is that supposed to be the resistance
against the German Reich that...
is controlling all of Europe?
The young man tried to destroy these papers
in my presence.
Some unknown classmate
gave them to me.
I destroyed them because I didn't want
to get into trouble.
Is this your suitcase?
- Yes, it's mine.
Take him away!
I've given the order to
close off the college for now.
Not even teachers or other personnal
are allowed to leave.
Sure!
I will certainly stay too.
Go back, and tell Alex not to wait for me.
- Quiet!
Scholl, Hans, get into Mahler's room
for interrogation!
Hurry up, miss!
Come here now!
Unlock the cuffs!
Thanks.
Let's get going.
Sit down.
Sophia Magdalena Scholl, from Ulm,
born on May 9, 1921
in Forchtenberg.
Protestant.
- Father?
Robert Scholl,
mayor of Forchtenberg.
You completed your nursing education?
- Yes.
Still with a second address in Munich,
Franz-Joseph St. #13,
- Summerhouse, landlord Schmidt?
- Yes.
Any criminal record?
- No.
You admitted to the janitor
that it was you...
who threw the flyers from the balcony.
They were lying on the marble handrail.
I pushed them over
when I passed by.
Why?
Such pranks are my nature.
I admitted it then and there
and I knew ...
I made a stupid mistake
when I pushed them over.
I am very sorry now,
but I guess it's too late.
Miss Scholl,
you spread flyers in college,
in violation of the
special war laws.
Do you know what the punishment for
treason and collaboration is?
I don't have anything to do with that.
- Imprisonment, labour camp...
or execution.
- I really didn't have anything to do with that.
Cigarettes?
- No, thanks.
But you do smoke, right?
- Occasionally.
They're a perfect fit.
Just coincidence.
Why did you bring an empty case to school?
I wanted to go to Ulm,
to pick up the clothes
that I brought to my mother last week.
- To Ulm?
That far?
In the middle of the week?
Yes
- Just for some clothes?
No, not just. I also want to visit a friend.
She just had a baby.
Also, my mother is sick.
- But why in the middle of the week?
But you are having classes!
You seem to be in quite a hurry.
Because my friend suggested
going to Hamburg,
so I want to get back
before the weekend.
I planed to take
the 12:48 express train.
I already made an appointment with
my sister's friend at the Holzkirchner station.
You can ask him.
His name?
- Otto Aicher.
He arrived from Solln at 11:30...
11:30 in Munich.
Aicher, with an "e"?
- With "a - i"
Didn't you have dirty clothes
for Ulm?
No, I wash my own small clothes.
And large pieces
I didn't have any yet.
So, it means you don't need
any clean clothes yet?
and you just told me
that you expressly took an empty suitcase home
to get clean clothes?
I wanted to be prepared for the next weeks,
since I was in Ulm anyway.
So, if you wanted to go back to Ulm,
why were you still at school?
I had an appointment with a friend.
Her name is Gisela Schertling
We planned to have lunch together
in the cabin at English Garden at noon.
Even though you wanted
to go to Ulm?
I changed my mind last night...
I came back to school
to cancel my appointment with Gisela.
Why did your brother accompany you
to school?
since you only came to
cancel the appointment?
Hans and I often go to school together.
He wanted to go to the neurological clinic.
The janitor said you were on the 2nd floor balcony
at about 11 o'clock.
What were you doing there?
- We were on the way to Gisela.
She was in Prof. Huber's
introductory philosophy class.
But that's on the 1st floor.
- Yes, we were there 10 minutes early,
so I showed my brother around
at the psychology department.
I often have classes on the 2nd floor.
And where did you see the flyers?
I saw them everywhere on the ground,
if that's what you mean.
And you didn't even read them?
- Yes, I did, but only at a glance.
My brother was even joking about them.
- A political joke?
No, just that it's a waste of paper.
He's as unpolitical as me.
During the uprising of the female students
at the Germany Museum,
when the district principal was
holding a speech,
were you there?
No.
Attendance was mandatory.
- I stay out of politics.
What do you think of the speech,
given by district principal
when he mentioned...
that girls should rather have
give birth to babies, for the Führer,
instead of fooling around at college.
He even said that the ugly ones
could marry to his assistents.
That's a matter of taste.
The circumstances under which
you were found at the university
already make you a suspect.
I seriously advise you
to tell me the full truth right now,
independent of any side effects this might have.
I deny to have any connection
with these leaflets.
Except the joke I made.
I understand that
we are under suspicion
until the real culprits are found.
- But my brother and I really
have nothing to do with this.
Do you really think you can hide
your true feelings from me?
All I told you is the truth.
Mrs Scholl, my colleagues did not find
any traces of the flyers...
in your suitcase. And your brother confirmed
your statements during his interrogations.
Reliefed?
I wasn't worried.
Have the transcriber come in.
I will let her to record my statement.
You have to listen carefully...
If there is any conflict with your statement
you must tell me right away.
Do you understand, Mrs Scholl?
- Yes.
Even though you will be placed
under temporary arrest,
but...
it depends...
Maybe you still can go to Ulm tonight.
You're done?
Metternich! Release papers.
Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler.
Mr. Schürmer! Come along!
You students think you can be here,
and keep us busy
with your phantasies.
Please hand over your jewellery.
Your watch.
(Radio) ...we already made up our mind to
defend our lives by any means.
...no matter whether the
rest of the world
understand the necessity of this war or not
- Necklace with pendant.
...The time for a total war has come...
Follow me.
Let us say farewell to fear
and bourgouis squeamishness,
who, in this fight with fate...
still live by the rule
Clean my back,
but don't get me wet!
- Please take off you clothes and give them to me.
There is enormous danger.
We must put into huge effort...
If you still have anything illegal, give it to me,
and I'll throw it down the toilet.
I am a prisoner too.
Now, that time is coming...
I have nothing.
...it's time to take off the gloves!
OK, we're here.
... will thank us on his knees
that we have taken him on
Ladies, get in, hurry, hurry.
I want to listen to the speech!
Have you heard anything
about my brother?
Your brother is already done.
He is waiting with other men upstairs.
You are the main suspect right now
since you had the large suitcase...
and you threw down the leaflets.
Do not admit anything!
There's nothing to admit.
How long have you been here?
- One year and five days.
They caught one of my letters,
with Ludwig-Thoma quotes critical of Hitler
Even though, you still work for those people?
- They make me to do this.
The reason I am here
is to prevent you to kill yourself...
Why are you against the Nazis?
- My brother and I are Communists,
even though my brother has a
senior position in an insurance company.
But I admire the selfless help
among the Communists.
People have to do something.
Scholl, Sophia.
Come with me!
I hope, we'll never see each other.
Good luck! - You too, good luck!
Wait here.
OK, Miss, here are your release papers.
You were lucky this time.
Admissions.
Understood!
Follow me. Follow me!
You can take off your coat.
Sit down.
Your father was put into jail for 6 weeks
because he called our leader...
"God's punishment for humans".
He was arrested for the
crime of treason,
and his professional license was revoked.
I want to know
what your father thought of you...
joining the Hitler Youth?
My dad never influenced
our political preferences.
Typical democrat!
Why did you join the Hitler Youth?
Because I had heard that
Hitler will bring our nation glory,
good luck and fortune, and that
everyone will have a job and bread.
That everybody will enjoy
freedom and happiness.
You are single?
- I am engaged.
With Fritz Hartnagel
He is a commander on the Eastern front.
Stalingrad?
- Yes.
When was the last time you saw each other?
- More than half year ago.
Have you seen this gun before?
My brother had a gun like this
He was sergeant in the army.
Why do you have 190 bullets
in your drawer?
9mm bullets?
- They are also my brother's.
When was the last time you
bought stamps?
About two weeks ago.
- Where, and how many?
A the post office #23
on Leopold street.
Ten 12 cents. Perhaps five 6 cents.
I can't remember exactly.
No more than that?
- No.
Have you seen these stamps?
No.
- You've never seen them before?
- No.
We found those in your brother's room.
Why did you never mention...
that your brother has these
quantities of stamps?
Youwhen and where I
bought stamps recently.
140? Who of you, and what for
did you need these stamps?
What were you planning
to mail out?
Greeting to friends and relatives.
We write a lot.
So, you have seen those stamps?
- I am guessing.
You found those at
my brother's place. Not mine!
Do you own a typewriter?
The one in my brother's room,
we borrowed from the landlord.
She lent it to us so my brother
can type something. - What?
An essay about philosophy
and theology.
Not this flyer here?
- No.
An essay about philosophy and
theology like this perhaps...
"Hitler cannot win this war,
he can only prolong it."
or "a criminal cannot give Germany victory"
or "federalism is the future of Germany
freedom of speech, freedom of religion."
Hans didn't write those.
You did?
- No.
But you believe in this kind of world order.
- I don't care about politics.
Anyway, we analyzed this typewriter,
and it was used
to write a pamphlet which was,
at the beginning of this month,
mailed to different addresses in
Munich and Augsburg.
I don't know anything about this.
Sit down!
- Watch her.
You were there when we found
this pamphlet on your brother,
and when he tried to destroy it.
Have you seen this paper before?
No. - Read it,
before you make any false statements.
"200,000 Germans died,
sacrified for the status...
of a military imposter."
- Does this remind you something?
Isn't it pretty similar to other six flyers?
And what about the handwriting?
I dont recognize it.
- Give me a break!
The guy who wrote this is
an individual named Christoph Probst,
He is a friend of yours from lnnsbruck.
We found his letters at your place.
The exact same handwriting!
Probst is also studying medicine.
Loves the family and the
mountains of his fatherland.
Another privileged brat, dragging his own country into the mud,
while others are dying in the war.
Who else is involved in this, beside you,
your brother and that Christoph Probst?
Please stop accusing me!
You withheld all this
evidence from your home,
even though I asked you
to tell me the truth.
I just only admit what I really know.
Do you want to know what your brother
said about this evidence,
after he tried to deny it first,
just like you.
"With the military failure in the East,
And with the enormous increase
in American and British forces,
I concluded that we could not win this war,
and that the only way
to avoid further bloodshed,
and to keep a European community,
lies in finding a way
to shorten this war.
I am also deeply concerned about
the treatment people in the occupied zones
This is just a political statement,
not a response to you accusations
This is just a political statemen.
It doesn't have anything to do with your accusations.
This...
is undermining the moral of the army
and treason.
I dont believe my brother said that!
So you think I am fabricating evidence?
Unless my brother tells me personally
that he made those statements
I won't believe that he said that.
You're familiar with the
Eickemayer Studio, aren't you?
Yes.
Eickemayer is in Krakau for a few months.
He gave us the key...
to the studio to us, so we can
show his pictures to his friends.
The fingerprint on the copymachine...
are your brother's.
Your brother has confessed.
He admitted to have designed,
copied and handed out
all six kinds of the flyers.
He claims that he handed out
five thousand flyers in Munich in one night.
You lived with your brother,
you were with him on the balcony
this morning,
and you still want me believe
that you have nothing to do with this?
You claim you didn't know what these
flyers were about? Just admit it!
You and your brother made
and sent those pamphlets!
Yes!
And I am proud of it!
What will happen to me and
my brother now?
You should have thought about this
earlier, Miss Scholl.
Will out family be arrested?
- Others will decide that.
I have to go to bathroom.
- Not now.
Who drafted these?
Me! - You are lying again, Miss Scholl!
Just a few weeks ago...
we did a scientific analysis
of the writing,
and we are absolute sure
they are done by a male.
An intellectual. Your brother!
Who mailed out these flyers?
My brother and I.
Excuse me, I really have to go to bathroom.
Lohner!
Bathroom!
Follow me.
Hurry!
Open the handcuffs, it hurts!
What are you doing with them?
You know the colleagues, Miss Scholl?
There's gonna be one after the other now...
Next door to the left.
You know the way.
Who did this graffity:
"Down with Hitler!"...
and "Freedom"...
and a crossed-out swastika,
at Ludwig street University,
at Marienplatz, Kaufinger street
and in Schwabing?
My brother and I
made them.
Your brother said after he got arrested:
"Go back home...
tell Alex not to wait for me".
Schertling was right there.
Was he telling Schmorell to run away?
Hans had a appointment with Schmorell,
he didnt want him wait for nothing.
- You talk about your plan with Schmorell?
- No
What about Graf?
- Neither.
Why do you keep lying, Miss Scholl?
- I am not lying.
Here.
This is your confession.
Sign here.
Lohner!
Take her away!
Mohr supposedly told Lohner:
this kind of people...
is what Germany needs.
But we have to re-educate them.
Maybe they will try to
rebuild your world view.
But I'm telling you,
they're in for a surprise.
Why?
- Even the bosses are getting scared.
A lot people think the invasion will
happen within eight to ten weeks.
And then it'll be quick -
Germany will be liberated.
If my mother finds out
I am under arrest,
she won't survive the shock.
She is over 60,
and has been sick for months.
If the Gestapo comes to my house...
she my get jailed as well...
And your father?
He is 10 years younger.
He always gave us strength.
Then at least she's not alone.
Thanks.
"We will not be silent,
we are your forgotten conscience!
The "White Rose" won't let you
sleep in peace!".
Who is "us"?
- My brother wrote this.
The last line of 4th flyers ends with:
"Please copy...
and pass around".
Here, at last, is talk about resistance.
That doesn't sound like an individual's crime.
- There is no organization.
What do you know about Willi Graf?
Sergeant, he studied medicine like my brother.
He comes to our house occasionally.
We know he helped you guys
copying the flyers at the studio.
Maybe you found his fingerprints,
but he went to studio at some other time.
- When?
Middle of January.
We were showing Eickemayer's paintings.
That's why there are all kinds of
fingerprints in studio.
Who else was there? Schmorell?
- Maybe, I dont know.
I was just there at beginning,
then I went to concert.
Did Probst bring flyer to Salzburg
and Linz? - No.
Hans didn't tell him anything,
cause he has wife and three children
You better tell me the damn truth.
I am expecting from you...
to finally own up to
what's going on.
Graf, Anneliese?
I met her about 8-10 times.
What did you talk about?
- About literature and science.
I found Graf rather unpolitical.
- Unpolitical, but an insider?
I have to insist that Graf has absolutely
nothing to do with the flyers.
How about Schertling?
- Gisela I met several times,
since we studied at same university.
I know her from labor camp Krauchwies.
She is a national-socialist.
- By your saying, Miss Scholl,
Germans are either apolitical
or are admirers of the movement.
Then everything should be fine for you,
isn't it, Mr Mohr?
As per our investigations
this so called "White Rose"...
bought 10,000 sheets of paper
in January alone...
as well as 2,000 envelopes.
Who did that?
- My brother and I.
It may sound plausible,
since the first four issues
only had impressions in the Hundreds.
You don't expect me to believe
that you and your brother alone...
copied thousands of flyers
for the 5 and 6th edition?
and then sent them out?
- We worked on them day and night.
Very admirable. And beside that you are
still taking classes?
Yes. We were trying to make it look
like there were lots of members.
We know that your brother, Graf von Schmorell,
as well as some...
Furtwängler, and a Wittenstein served
together at the Eastern front.
They all study here in Munich.
And there was no political
communication between them?
My brother only told me about the
mass deaths, but not about...
his comrades.
- I don't believe you, Miss Scholl.
Nowadays everyone is careful
when it comes to political opinions.
Just like you with your flyers.
Where did you get these addresses?
Copied from phonebooks
at the German museum.
Let's take a look at Stuttgart:
On Jan 27th and the morning after,
about 700 flyers were mailed.
At the same day in Munich...
about 2,000 flyers were distributed.
It's impossible for you and your brother
to have done this... 2,000 pieces!
I took the express train
to Stuttgart on the 27th...
I had the flyers in my suitcase.
After I arrived...
I threw half of them
into the mailbox at the station,
and the rest I put
into mailboxes in the outskirts.
Your brother couldn't have distributed
2,000 flyers in Munich by himself.
2,000 flyers, put into phone books,
in public phone booths.
In Munich as well as other cities.
Who helped him?
I wasn't in Munich.
Who supported you financially?
My father gives me 150 Reichsmark
every month,
and my brother
is paid by the army.
You're saying you can afford your life as well as
all the flyers and postage with that?
Each of your many trips to Ulm
already costs 15 Mark.
We borrowed some money from friends.
- From whom?
Here, upper left corner...
The letter "I" probably stands
for income.
And the name after amount must be the donor.
- Yes.
Your fiancé is in that list as well.
So he was a member of the group!
- No!
Everytime we borrowed money,
we made up a story.
You can ask anyone on the list.
My brother and I are
who you are looking for.
Have you ever thought about
the consequences for you and your brother...
getting into this kind of thing?
We have all the names!
Miss Scholl, you should consider
cooperating with us.
This would have a positive effect
on your sentence.
Think about your poor parents,
and the shame you brought to them.
Mr Mohr, you accuse us of treason.
And now you want us...
to betray our so-called comrades,
just to save my own skin?
Helping solve a crime
is not a betrayal.
My brother's classmates
have nothing to do with this.
Lohner!
Take her away!
I am very worried about Fritz.
How could I write his name in my notebook?
Was he part of it?
- Absolutely not.
And he really didn't have a clue?
- No.
His is a solider, and he
keeps up his oath to Hitler.
We had lots of fights about this.
I was always against supporting the front line,
as it would only prolong the war.
He didn't agree with that at all.
Was he in Stalingrad too?
- He was there.
Luckily, he was transfered to Lemberg
as one of the last groups.
He is now in a hospital.
They amputated two of his fingers,
since he and his people
were out in the cold...
at 30 below. Day and night.
For weeks.
I really hope he'll survive the war,
without becoming its victim.
What if he finds out
what happened to you?
he will understand me.
I hope so.
What does he look like?
Tall, dark hair.
A free spirit.
He could always
make me laugh.
The love, this unconditional love,
is just so amazing.
When was the last time you saw him?
Last summer.
We were in Karolinensiel at the North Sea.
We sailed out with a fishing boat
early in the morning...
and in the evening
to the flats on a horse carriage.
At night we sang,
and talked about peace.
No soliders, no planes and no bombs.
Only the sea, the sky,
sea breeze and our dreams.
Dear God, I can't help
but babble to you.
I can do nothing else
but to offer you my heart.
You created us,
and our hearts are so tense,
until it finds peace in You.
Amen.
Here, have some.
It's real coffee... From beans.
Miss Scholl, you are concerned about the
welfare of the German people, aren't you?
Yes. - Unlike this Elser,
who planted a bomb...
in the Bürgerbräukeller
in Munich 1939.
Although you chose the wrong slogans,
you used a peaceful methods.
So why do you guys want
to punish us then anyway?
Because of the law!
Without law there's no order.
The law you're referring to
used to defend people's liberty of speech...
before Hitler took power in 1933.
But now, people who speak up
are punished by prison or death.
What does order have to do with this?
What else should we abide by,
if not by the law,
no matter by whom it was drafted.
- By your conscience.
Oh really...
This is the law,
and this is the people.
And my job as a police officer
is to see whether the two align.
And if it doesn't...
I have to figure out where the problem is.
- Laws change.
The conscience doesn't.
- What if everyone would decide for themselves...
what's right and wrong, by his conscience.
Even if a criminal...
would succeed in overthrowing
the leader, what would happen then?
We would end up in criminal chaos!
The so-called free expression,
federalism, democracy?
We used to have them all.
And we know where
that got us.
Without Hitler and his party there would finally
be law and order for everyone.
And protection for every individual,
not just those agreeing with the general consensus.
Arbitrariness. Follower.
What gives you the right to be this dismissive?
- You are the one being dismissive.
If you label my brother and me criminals,
just because of those flyers,
even though we've done nothing but
trying to convince with words.
You and your privileges, that you
and your clique are exploiting shamelessly.
You are using our money
to go to college during wartime.
During that damn democracy,
all I could become was a tailor.
Do you know who made me join the police?
The French who occupied Pfalz.
Not German democracy.
If there hadn't been the movement
I would still be a police officer
in the countryside of Pirmasens today.
The shameful Versailles Treaty,
inflation, unemployment.
The economic crisis. All that was swept away
by our leader Adolf Hitler.
And also lead Germany into a doomed war.
For whom every further victim is a waste.
- Into the heroic war!
You receive the same food stamps
as we,
the ones you disdain
and fight against.
No matter what happens
you live a better life than we do.
You absolutely have no need to do so.
Why is it that you're still acting up?
The leader and the German people
are protecting you!
In here, in this Wittelsbacher Palais,
or having my family arrested.
Our German soldiers are liberating Europe
from the money class...
and from the Bolschewists, and are fighting
for a great and free Germany.
Germany's territory will never again
be occupied. Mark my words.
Until this war is over, and
foreign troops will march in...
and all kinds of people will point at us,
saying we didn't fight against Hitler.
And what will you say when,
after the final victory has been achieved...
and after all that blood and sacrifice
wealth and freedom will reign in Germany?
The things you dreamed about
when you joined the Hitler Youth?
German people don't anymore expect
that to happen in Hitler's Germany.
But what if it really did come true,
then what?
Are you a protestant?
- Yes.
Even the Church is asking
the disciples to follow them.
Even if they doubt.
- Church is voluntary.
But Hitler and the Nazis
will not give you any choices!
Why would a young person like you
risk everything for mislead ideas?
For my own conscience.
I don't understand
why you, with your talent,
wouldn't agree with
National Socialist ideas.
Freedom, Honor, Wealth.
A morally responsible country,
this is our faith!
Didn't the horrible bloodshed the
National Socialists caused...
all over Europe,
in the name of freedom and honor,
open up your eyes?
Germany's name will forever be shamed
if the German youth...
won't overthrow Hitler, in order to
create a new spiritual Germany!
The new Europe can only be
of national socialist nature.
And what if your leader
is a lunatic?
Think about national hatred!
We had a Jewish teacher in Ulm...
who was forced to stand
in front of an SA-Group,
and everyone was ordered to walk
in front of him and spit in his face.
Since that night, he's gone. Just like
thousands of others here in Munich since '41.
Presumably sent to
work camps in the East.
You believe this nonsense?
The Jews are emigrating themselves.
Solders who were at the Eastern front have been
talking about extermination camps for a while.
Hitler wants to eradicate
all Jews in Europe.
He has been promoting this madness
for 20 years already.
How can you believe
that Jews are different from us?
This gang has only brought us misery.
But you belong...
to a confused generation that doesn't
understand anything. Wrong upbringing.
But it's probably it's our own fault.
I would have raised a girl like you differently.
If you knew how shocked it was
when I heard that
Nazis are killing mentally handicapped
children with poison gas!
My mother's friends told me
how children from Church program were taken...
from the institute,
and transported away in trucks.
The other kids were asking
"Where does the truck go?"
"They're going to heaven"
the nurses told them.
So the rest of the kids got
on the truck as well. Singing.
And because I feel for these people
you think my upbringing must've been wrong?
These are unworthy lives.
You have been trained as a nurse...
you must have met
mental patients.
Yes, and that's why I clearly know
that there are no circumstances,
under which a person should
make judgements that only God could make.
Nobody knows what in going on
in the soul of a mental patient.
Nobody knows which secret,
interior maturity could rise out of suffering.
Every life has a value.
You have to get used to
this coming of a new age.
What you are talking about
has nothing to do with reality.
Of course it is related to reality.
With reality, decency,
morality and God.
- God doesn't exist...
Isn't it right that you
relied on your brother,
that you agreed with him,
and just went along?
Shouldn't we just
take it down like that?
No, Mr. Mohr.
Because it is not the truth.
You known, I have a son.
He is even a year younger than you are.
He sometimes has some crazy ideas too,
but now he is at the Eastern front.
Because he knows
he must do his duty.
You really believe in the
final victory, Mr. Mohr?
Ms. Scholl, if you had thought
about all this,
you would have never
gotten involved in these activities.
This is about your life!
Here... For the protocol,
I am accusing you of the following:
"After our conversation
you have come to the conclusion
that you and your brother's actions,
In the current wartime situation,
are a crime against the community.
Especially in the consideration of
our suffering army in the East,
and that it should
be condemned to the fullest.
No, not as I see it.
Confessing to mistake
is not the same as betraying your brother.
But a betrayal of the idea.
I would do it all over again,
because not mine,
but your world view is flawed.
I still think that
I've done what is right for my people.
I have no regrets,
and I will take full responsibility.
Please send up a transcriber.
Yes.
Tell the boss we are done.
Mohr offered me a golden bridge
if I renounce our ideas.
And?
- I didn't go for it.
Why not?
Sophie, you are so young, you have to survive.
For your ideas and for yourself.
And for your family.
For god's sake, take his offer.
There is no going back.
Air Raid Alert
Get down! Away from the windows!
Down here it's the safest.
Come down!
It won't take long,
and we're free!
The new arrival isn't Schmorell,
it's a Christoph Probst.
For treason as well.
I am really sorry.
I thought...
He has 3 kids.
The youngest was just born.
And his wife is down
with childbed fever.
Ms. Scholl,
you have to see the prosecutor now.
Go along.
Here is my indictment.
Your trial will start tomorrow morning
in front of a senior judge.
I have submitted a court order.
Tomorrow already?
- This case doesn't allow any delays.
Treason, moral disruption
and support of the enemy
And tomorrow already
will be the trial!
What a glorious,
sunny day.
I sincerely pray to you,
I call upon you,
"You" I call,
I may not know a thing about you,
but you are still my only hope.
I pray to you,
please don't abandon me,
my dear God, my dear father.
Amen.
I am attorney Klein,
your court-appointed lawyer.
Have you seen the indictment?
Yes.
- Any questions?
What will happen to my parents
and siblings in Ulm?
Please!
This will be decided
in a separate case.
I just want to know what will happen.
Aren't you my lawyer?
You act like I got you
into this situation.
I am entitled to know what will happen
to my family, and you know that!
Do you really think you are in a position
to make demands?
No matter what happens to my brother,
I don't want an easier sentence.
I am just as guilty as he is,
by your viewpoint.
Is that all you got to say?
No. - It seems, you and your brother
don't feel like...
actually becoming part of the community.
But you are very wrong about that!
Even the chairman of the people's court
will be here tomorrow.
He will make sure
you will forget about this nonsense.
He won't have any mercy with you.
Open the door!
Do you want something?
- No, nothing. We'll see you in court tomorrow.
What a coward.
Freisler will be presenting both of you
as rotten criminals tomorrow.
He used to be a USSR officer.
Now he has to prove his loyalty.
Our father used to say:
I want you to live straight and free,
even if it may be hard.
Will the trial be public?
I'm sure it is.
It's a show trial, a deterrent.
Then Freisler will have to talk about
the flyers in front of everybody!
And everyone will hear what we have to say.
I'm sure there's going to be a riot...
among the students when they find out
what's happening because of some flyers.
After the trial you will probably be transferred.
And in the worst case:
everyone gets 99 days
before excecution.
"A tough mind, and a soft heart"
my brother used to say.
I once dreamed...
that I was holding a child in my arms,
with a long white dress.
I could feel her warmth...
But suddenly the earth shook,
and beneath me
a crevasse opened.
I began to slip.
And I look at the child...
but I still had enough time
to put her safely on the ground...
I plunged, but I still felt liberated
and relaxed.
The child in the long white dress
is our idea, and it survived.
Scholl, get ready for transport!
- She has to get dressed properly first!
Thanks.
May God be with you, Sophie!
- May God be with you, Else!
Thank you so much.
How are you?
- And yourself?
Be quiet!
Only speak when are you are asked!
You must fight for yourself now.
- Quiet now!
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler!
I hereby announce
the court of the people opened...
agaist Hans Fritz Scholl and
Sophie Magdalena Scholl from Munich.
and further Christoph Hermann Probst
from Aldrans, for acts of treason,
moral disruption
and support of the enemy.
Probst, Christoph!
You are married with 3 children?
Yes, 2 and a half, 1 and 3 months,
and 4 weeks old.
And how is a failure like you
supposed to raise...
three children, to be real Germans?
- I am a good father and...
"and" what?
...and have no political ambition.
No political ambitions...
You are making me laugh!
Is this your handwriting?
Yes. - Despite the welfare
of the German national socialist Reich...
to provide you with an education,
and despite the fact...
that the national socialist
population politics allowed you...
to have your family as a student,
that still didn't keep you...
from creating this manuscript
when Scholl's asked you to.
An article which uses the heroic
experiences of Stalingrad...
to portrait our leaders
as a military imposter,
and to promote surrender.
Do you admit this?
Yes, sir.
But it was just a draft...
There is no "just", when the German people
are fighting to survive.
But I have to admit that I was rather
depressed at the time when I wrote this...
Really?
So a clinical depression was causing you...
to write this essay?
...depressed at the time when I wrote this.
The war, my wife's fever,
all of those...
Oh, please stop! This is no excuse
to commit treason of this scale!
But I already distanced myself
from this yesterday. In writing.
I also have to clarify that
I did not finance...
or materially support,
produce, or distribute...
any of these pamphlets.
My emotional condition was...
- Yes, we have all heard how you...
...are trying to play the psychotic retard,
in order to get out of this.
Mr. Chairman,
my children need their father.
German children do not
need a father like you.
You are unworthy, Probst!
Defence, any further questions?
- No, Mr. Chairman.
Take him away!
Scholl, Hans...
You have studied medicine
since 1939? - Yes.
And you are, thanks to this
national socialist government,
in your 8th term by now.
- Yes, the 8th term is correct.
On this nation's money!
Another parasite.
At some point you were serving
at a field hospital...
and worked as medical staff on the
Eastern front, between July and November 1942?
That is true too.
But I want to say that...
Be quiet until lI ask you!
- I wanted to say that I am not a parasite...
Shut your mouth
or I will have you removed!
...study is a duty,
for a member for the student guard.
Oh well,
let's talk about duty then...
As a student you have the duty
to be an exemplary member of the community.
This, and the support the Reich
provided you with,
didn't stop you,
during the summer of 1942,
from handing out four "White Rose"
flyers which, in a derogatory way,
tried to predict the German defeat,
and was calling for a passive resistance,
and sabotage of military industries.
And was generally...
trying to promote ways to remove
the national socialist way of life...
from the German people.
- This is outrageous!
The boldness...
- Traitors... - ...the fatherland...
Scholl, do you admit this?
Yes. - And you even cowardly got
your sister involved into this.
It was my own decision.
- Did I ask you, defendant?
I need to correct this.
- Save us your commentaries!
Did you write these flyers
since you imagined...
that the German people would only
be able to survive by betraying their leader?
The war cannot... - Yes or no?
This is not a difficult question!
We do not have a chance against
the US, the UK and the Russia.
Just look at the map for yourself!
With mathematical accuracy is Hitler
leading Germany into an abyss.
He cannot win this war,
all he can do is extend it!
You are quite wrong about the
fighting spirit...
and the stamina
of the German people!
Through your terrorist support
of the enemy...
even more German will die!
Only if we find a way to quickly
to the war, can we avoid...
Stop the war? How that?
- ...avoid that even...
So, you think it's up to you
to decide about war and peace?
The German people
want the total war!
Germans' blood had bled dry, they want
peace. Hitler and his supporters...
will be responsible for a
unbelievable genocide in Europe,
one which will exceed any known scale.
Everybody here knows that...
Everyone...
- Who do you think you are?
You despicable dog,
you have the audaciousness...
to insult the leader
in front of this court?
I myself was at the Eastern front,
just like many in the audience here.
You weren't there!
With my own eyes I have seen
the bloodshed in Poland and Russia.
I saw women and children dying...
killed by German soldiers.
- And you really think that...
anybody here will believe your nonsense?
If Hitler and you
weren't afraid of our thoughts,
then we wouldn't be standing here today.
- Oh, shut up!
It is anyway...
shameless liar...
You are nothing but an... an idiot
and a rotten traitor.
End of questioning.
Any more questions?
- No.
No further question, Mr. Chairman.
- Scholl, Hans, back to your seat.
Sophia Scholl...
Aren't you ashamed to have
handed out those treasonous flyers...
at the university?
- No, I am not ashamed at all!
Throwing them into the atrium...
just like that?
No, not just like that,
but to get even the last ones...
Speak up,
we can hardly hear you.
I wanted to distribute every last one
of the flyers, so that our ideas...
would spread as quickly as possible...
- Idea? You call this filth a idea?
You would expect this from a certified idiot,
but not a German University student.
We fight with words.
- So you actually wrote:
"That's why you should separate from
those sub-human national socialists!"
Have a look at yourself,
if you want to see some sub-human beings!
How did you get the paper
to make these pamphlets?
We bought them, and from the university.
- So, from the university?
Malicious theft of common property! Paper!
Even though there is a shortage of paper!
But I am not surprised
that you would do this.
My brother and I tried to use
these flyers to awaken the people,
and to stop the bloodshed
against other countries and the Jews.
And not to wait for the Allies
to finally put an end to it.
Should we really become a nation,
excluded and hated by the rest of the world?
You know, a superior people
doesn't care about this
Your superior people actually
want peace.
And to find pride in humanity
once again.
It wants God, conscience,
and compassion.
Well, who do you think
you are?
The total war will bring victory
to Germany.
It will come out of this
stronger and more pure.
What we said and wrote
is shared by many.
They just don't dare to say it.
- Oh, shut up already!
Questions?
- No.
Session finished.
Take her away!
We will now come to the closing
statements of the defendant.
I am the father...
- Remove these people from the court!
I am Robert Scholl, the father of
two of the defendants.
I want to clarify a few points...
- I have no permission! Remove him!
Get out, take him out!
- There is another type of justice!
Silence!
Now for your closing statements.
Defendants, rise!
Probst? - I beg you to spare me,
for the sake of my children.
I admit and repent
everything I have done.
And you, Scholl?
I beg you, your honor. Spare this man,
and punish me instead.
If you have nothing to say on your own
behalf, then be silent!
Sophia Scholl?
Soon you will stand where
we are standing right now.
Every decent being in this room is
outraged about what you are saying!
In the name of the German people,
the following charges against
Hans Fritz Scholl from Munich,
Sophia Magdalena Scholl
from Munich...
and Christoph Hermann Probst
from Aldrans...
are recognized by the 1. Senate of the
supreme court...
on February 22nd, 1943:
The defendants have been sending out flyers
during the war, in order to sabotage...
the arms production, and to overthrow the
national socialist way of life of our people,
to promote dangerous ideas and
to disgrace our leader...
and by doing so, helped the enemies
of this country...
and demoralized our troops.
You are therefore
sentenced to death.
You are deprived of any rights
as a citizen of this country.
You will cover the expenses
for this trial.
Your terror will soon be over.
Today you will hang us, and tommorrow
it will be your turn.
Take them away!
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
This way!
If you have anything to say
before your execution...
Please make it short,
Ms. Scholl.
Today already?
I was told
everybody has 99 days...
You better start writing.
Come here.
You have a visitor.
A visitor?
Please don't be afraid.
Given the choice, i would
do the same thing again.
You did well.
I am proud of you.
My little girl.
Mama...
How you stand by me,
brave and steadfast.
Now you will never again
come in through our door.
We will meet again
in eternity.
Well, Sophie.
Jesus...
Yes, Mother, but you too...
Ms. Scholl, please.
I just said farewell to my parents.
They will understand.
Come with me, please.
Ms. Scholl, my name is Alt.
I am the prison priest.
God, oh almighty father,
make this earth fruitful,
so the seeds you sow
do not fall in vain,
Let hope grow,
oh my creator,
for those who will only see it
for the last time.
Amen.
- Amen.
I beg you to give me
God's blessing.
God the father gives you his blessing,
for you are created by his own image.
God, the son gives you his blessing,
for his suffering and death have saved you.
God, the holy spirit gives you his blessing,
for he has taken you to his sacred temple.
Oh, all mighty God,
have mercy in your judgement...
and grant you
the eternal life.
Amen.
- Amen.
No one's love is greater than those
who sacrifice themselves for others.
God is with you.
This is against the regulations, but...
Please hurry.
Thanks.
It was not in vain.
Ms. Scholl.
The sun is still shining.
Sophia Magdalena Scholl,
The national attorney general has decided,
on 22.2.1943,
that no pardon will be granted.
So as not to obstruct justice.
It is exactly 5:00 pm.
The death sentence is to be carried out.
Long live Freedom!
Helmuth von Moltke brought the
6th flyer from the "White Rose"
through Scandinavia to England.
Millions of copies were...
air-dropped by the Allied planes
over Germany in 1943.
Its title was:
A german flyer,
Manifest of Munich students.
