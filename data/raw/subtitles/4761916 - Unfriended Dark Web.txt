Oh, no.
Go away.
Get out of here.
All right. Test.
Amaya is gonna love this.
Nice, that was fast.
Okay, let's see here.
This thing runs so much faster
than my old piece of crap.
Okay.
Holy cow.
There you are.
It's nice to see your face.
I know, I know.
Just remember
who has two thumbs
and gives the best massages
in the world.
Hmm?
Hang on.
Okay.
So I haven't ironed out
all the bugs yet
but, um, okay,
you know what, just...
You ready?
Okay.
I got a new computer today.
It's much faster
than my old one.
Can you, uh,
do you understand it?
Oh, I just... I just added
a new feature.
So, uh, when the app
doesn't understand a word,
you just... you just type it in
and it automatically
connects you to the ASL site,
and then there is a
video tutorial on how to do it.
Oh, damn it, damn it.
Hold on, hold on.
One sec, sorry.
Um...
Anyway,
I got the idea from, uh,
from when you told me
how hard it was
for you to understand me
when I'm on Skype.
So, what do you think?
Amaya, can you... can you type?
You know I can't...
Amaya... slow down,
there's door...
Sorry, yeah,
it's the door, door.
I...
Okay. All right, all right,
all right, all right.
I'm not moving.
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.
No, no, no.
Come on... come on. Ah, shh.
What is wrong with you?
Come on, let's go!
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.
Okay, how about, uh...
we go analog, huh?
- Little doo-doo-doo.
- There's a...
There's a warm-up round
before AJ's?
You guys, I got this for Nari
for her birthday
because I guess
I'm trying to compensate.
Rolling on the floor
laughing my ass off.
All right. Um, uh...
Hi, MTV.
My name is Kendra.
I live in Malibu.
I'm into blank
and I love to have a good time.
Okay, Matias, do you wanna
go first and then...
- Matias.
- Hi, my name is Kendra.
I'm from Malibu.
I'm into having sex
on top of a pizza
and I love having
a really good time.
Hi, my name is Kendra.
I'm from Malibu.
I'm really into
the systematic destruction
of an entire people
and their way of life...
...and I'm ready
to have a good time.
Uh, hi, my name is Kendra.
I'm, uh, from Malibu,
and I'm into snorting coke off
a clown's boner and...
- What?
- ...I love having a good time.
Matias, I can see the pores
on your face.
- What is going on over there?
- But like in a good way.
That actually looks like you're
calling from the year 2018.
I mean, it's a full
30 frames a second.
I don't think
you're ready for this.
Oh, my God, and stereo even.
I got a new laptop.
What, actually new?
Eh, it's, like, newish, yeah.
- Yeah, Craigslist.
- Ow, ow!
But unfortunately, like, everyone now, 'cause
they can see what he really looks like,
everyone on Facebook's just
like, blup, unfriending him.
Oi, so what? Are you guys gonna
come over or what?
Um, we were gonna come over
- but then, um...
- No!
...I started having
some severe...
- No!
- ...heartburn and...
I told you
he was gonna do this.
I never bail when it's
at one of yours.
Lexx, come on,
help me out here.
I mean, I'm cool with Skyping.
It's subway and bus
from my place, so I'm...
Skype clearly works for me...
You guys are so old.
AJ, it's... AJ, it's 3:00
in the morning in London.
Damon stayed up just for you.
Oh, come on, guys, guys,
I got chips and I've got dips
and I, uh,
I got some killer...
I got some killer buds.
Some what? Say that louder.
What?
What? What?
I got some killer bud.
Yeah, I know. I heard you. I
just wanted Linda to hear, too.
She's not gonna...
She still thinks marijuana
is illegal here.
Uh, and also, Serena, hello,
I sliced you a rabbit bowl.
Really?
And third, guys, how many times
do I have to tell you?
It is not just the government.
It is the circadians
and the Bilderbergs
and the Illuminati
and corporations.
Why do you think Facebook
and Twitter are free?
- Because you're the product.
- 'Cause we're the product.
Yes! They own
every single thing you post!
And everybody assumes that,
"Oh, it's just...
it's just pictures and shit."
All they really care about
is targeted marketing.
But the Internet,
as you know it,
is just the surface.
You guys are just like...
Oh, you just float
around up there
without a care in the world
but it is a...
It is a...
it is a deep goddamn ocean
and there are sharks
swimming below you.
They're just gonna...
They're gonna come in
from right up behind you when
you don't even see it coming,
and they're just... Hello?!
No, no, I'm here.
I mean, keep going.
Well, they're gonna come,
they're gonna get you,
and then it's just sayonara,
you know.
It's... That's it!
It's not just sharks
down there, guys.
There are leviathans
and krakens and colossuses.
Um, right, I believe the proper
plural is "colossi", mate.
You know what,
Google "Skyhook," okay?
You will shit yourself.
It is total integration
of Wi-Fi and cell towers,
GPS, IP address detection,
Bluetooth device tracking,
even those Fitbit things
you like to run around with,
they can track you
through that.
What are you doing, Lexx?
Come on.
Stop it. That's not funny.
Well played. Well played.
It's not funny, Serena.
Help me!
I just want to...
...get it through your heads!
Oh.
Someday.
Someday what?
You hope we get eaten?
No, actually,
I really hope you don't.
Aw, you're worried!
Like a big, ol' cuddly
teddy bear, huh?
Yeah, a teddy bear
in a survivalist bunker
with a year's supply
of food, guns and ammo.
Oh.
No! No!
No...
- What was that?
- That was my...
That's my impression of Nari
being attacked by a dick.
Oh, right.
Yes. Aw!
Oh, my God.
Is no one offended by...
Oh, wait, oh, wait!
Oh, wait! Uh, hold on.
I'm gonna play it now, okay?
Check it out.
I just got these new speakers.
Turn it down!
- AJ, turn it down!
- All right. All right.
All right. All right.
Hold on, hold on. Hold on.
You guys see that, though?
Look at my new box.
Bam! Bam!
Bam! Yeah, right?
You would love the way your
shit sounds up close, Lexx,
or you would if you were
comin' over but you're not.
I can't. Subway and bus
from my place, remember that?
Before we start,
there is something
that we wanna tell you guys.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait!
- Ooh.
Should we wait for Amaya?
I don't think Amaya's
gonna be comin'.
- Bam!
- Oh, yeah!
Bam!
Bam!
- That is amazing.
- Can I... Can I see it?
- Closer. Closer.
- Closer, closer, closer!
I wanna see it.
- Oh, it's great.
- Wow!
I am so happy for you guys.
- She asked me.
- Okay, no, no, no, no, wait,
you gotta tell us everything.
I was having my morning cup
of inspirational tea
and I swig back
the little last bit of it.
Basically,
I almost choke on this
because it was in the cup.
Were you just watching her
drink it the whole time,
just going like,
"She's gonna find it soon."
Well, yeah. But... she puts
milk in her tea, you know.
- So it's like cloudy.
- Awesome, guys.
It's my mom's ring.
- It's your mom's ring?
- Aw! That's, aw, that's...
Oh, my God!
Did you... Wait, did you, uh,
did you ask Nari's dad for
permission and did you film it?
Please say you did because
oh, my God, I just...
I loved the look on his face
when he found out
that you two weren't,
uh, roommates and I just...
I would really
love to see that.
AJ, it's not the time.
It was cool when you
stood up to him,
that's all I'm sayin'.
It was just sweet.
Serena, is your...
Is your mom excited?
- Yeah, she's really excited.
- Cool.
I just, um...
You know...
Uh, the cancer has progressed,
so it's...
It's... um,
it's moved
into her brain and,
uh, they have her
on life support, though,
and they're really trying
some aggressive treatment,
so it's...
I wish I'd asked her sooner
so we just had more time,
you know.
I remember when
I had to put my dog down.
Oh, my God.
You're so bad at this.
I am so... No, I am so thrilled
for you guys, you have no idea.
I always thought Matias and
Amaya would be the first to...
Nice recovery, mate,
but still it sucks.
Well, oh!
And hey, um, by the way,
by the way...
What is that sound?
Universal Life Church,
fully certified,
took five minutes online,
I can totally marry you guys,
that's right.
That says "wedding officiant"?
- Yep.
- Yeah, there's nothing
more romantic
than being married
by the last guy
you ever slept with.
Uh, that is the only guy, Lexx.
Nari?
Ooh!
Nari?
Nari...
No, no.
No.
This is Amaya's
favorite sunset spot.
What?
Hi.
Look, I know... I know you're mad
at me, and I know, we've both...
we've both been busy,
but I feel like...
I know, I... I've been spending
a lot of time on this app,
but I've been doing it
so that we can...
So that we can
communicate better.
Amaya.
I went... I went
to the ASL class, uh...
No. No, I'm just, uh...
Uh, Amaya!
Damn it.
Hey, guys,
I'm gonna head out real quick.
Uh, what's up?
Where are you going?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll explain later.
All right. Bye then.
Is everything okay, Matias?
Uh, sometimes that guy.
I believe in the truth
and Damon believes in the lies.
Damon believes
in the hard lies
and I believe
in the crazy truth.
All right.
No, no, it's not impossible,
it's just...
it is improbable, but...
Thank you, Captain Spock.
Uh, that is Ambassador Spock.
And we are nothing
without our chain of command.
Hah, you're such a nerd, dude.
Hey, what the hell?
Sounds like someone
is meditating or something.
Matias, are you okay?
I thought you
were going somewhere.
What's goin' on?
Mate, Matias, what's going on?
Do you wanna share...
share your screen, mate?
Whoa! That looks like the
wallpaper's actually moving.
Yeah, it is.
It switched when I connected.
Connected to what?
I, uh, I have no idea,
this river thing.
All right.
That's an overlay network.
You've been bouncing it
everywhere.
- What's an overlay network?
- Uh, hey, Damon,
Damon, you gotta
translate that, man.
Oh, um, sorry, uh,
it's so no one can track you.
Shit! This is...
- Dude, this is darknet.
- Yeah, probably.
- Damon, what's darknet?
- Uh, it is part of the Internet
that isn't or can't be
indexed by a search engine.
It's where you find marketplaces
for bad shit, basically,
like, um, Silk Road.
Damon, you know about that.
It was all about drugs,
illegal IDs,
stolen credit cards, exploits,
even assassination for hire.
Lolita City,
which is all about child porn
- and, like, fan fiction...
- Okay, AJ, we got it.
- Yeah, definitely... yeah.
- Yeah, maybe you should
just leave whatever
that is alone, Matias.
Oh, whoa! Okay.
It looks like
an old-school PBS.
Charon is the ferryman
of the dead.
"The ferryman of Hades
who carries souls
of the newly deceased
across the river Styx..."
Styx, sorry.
"...and Acheron that divides
the world of the living
from the world of the dead."
Dude, whose computer
did you buy?
I didn't... I didn't buy it. I...
There's, um, there's a cyber
cafe that I've been...
that I've been working at
and I... I don't know,
and I noticed this computer
was sitting in the lost
and found for the last,
I don't know, three or...
three or four weeks.
Wait, well, hang on,
you stole someone's computer?
No, I didn't...
I didn't steal it, I just...
Hold on, mate. You told me
you bought it on Craigslist.
I felt like shit
the moment I took it.
I don't know
what I was hoping for.
I just... I kept having
to go there
because I wanted a better
computer to work on my app with
and then my thing was just
moving so goddamn slow
that I thought whoever's
laptop this was, I mean...
But look here, look,
when I... I went on Facebook,
all of this stuff auto-filled.
Norah C. IV, oh!
Pretentious twat.
Only an elitist asshat
would have that kind of name.
Oh, yeah, okay,
Alistair Jeffcock.
Hey, Jeffcock
is a family name, Lexx.
Oh, yeah.
It's a fake name.
Guys, it's "Charon" backwards.
Charon IV, Charon IV, yeah.
He's one of them.
He's one of them,
and whoever they are,
they must...
This is where they meet up
to trade.
Trade what?
Well, one of them
was actually sending me
private messages earlier.
It was, uh, Charon68.
Oh, the poor schmuck
never made it to 69.
Yeah, here.
"Just processed the transfer.
You'll have it soon."
It's like he's placing an order for
something he already paid for.
Matias, go back
to the beginning.
Well, the computer
was acting strangely,
so I ran a Disk Utility
and it said
the drive was full, so...
I was lookin' around
and I found this, uh,
this folder, right?
It was...
hidden, invisible,
and it's got videos.
- Nine hundred and sixty gig...
- Show us.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Look at those addresses.
That's here, that's...
the ones on the east side,
and...
I think it's okay.
- He's been wardriving.
- Totally.
- Translate, guys.
- Um, okay, hackers drive
through neighborhoods,
trying to scoop out
Wi-Fi addresses
of any unsecured
or vulnerable routers
so they can...
Hackers can activate
the camera on laptops
and phones and disable
the indicator lights
so you wouldn't even know
that they were on.
- Oh!
- Even the director of the FBI
- says he keeps his covered.
- Yeah, so think about that
next time you're servicing
your porn addiction, AJ.
- So this guy's good.
- Yeah, this takes mad skills.
He might be a goddamn maestro.
Oh, more like a goddamn psycho.
- Yeah.
- Hey, did you open that link
in the folder,
the one called "Account?"
Wait, that... that's just
from a couple of minutes ago.
Bitcoin, that's not
a real currency, right?
It's cryptocurrency.
No middleman, no banks.
It's 10 million.
That's $10 million, guys.
Whoa, wait,
this is a joke, right?
Um, dude, are you... Are you
being serious right now or...
All right, the exchange rate
right now is 663.02
per XPT
- times 16,263.52.
- Yep.
- Yep.
- Ten million change.
Yep, 10 million.
- Do you see that?
- It's almost 11.
Free money
just sitting there.
No, no, there's no such thing
as free money, AJ.
I hate to burst your bubble.
He's talking about the money.
Then say something.
Wait, wait, don't...
Type, uh, "For what?"
Hello, hair.
He's talking about hair.
AJ, for once in your life,
just put a cork in it.
Method... what's he...
What is that?
"A surgical procedure
in which a hole is...
drilled into the skull."
Oh, my God, this is...
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
No, no, no, no, Matias!
- Matias!
- Just shut it off!
Matias, shut it off!
All right, all right,
all right!
That's him, isn't it?
Don't answer.
Contributions?
Charon 68,
the first thing he wrote
was that he liked
the last contribution.
Um, go back to the video folder
and scroll all the way
to the bottom.
Just go all the way down.
No, Matias,
don't open it, please.
- Just...
- No, just open.
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I don't...
Oh, God.
Uh, no, no, no, no, okay.
- No, I can't... I can't...
- Oh, God.
Out of this one,
out of this one.
I can't watch that.
Okay, these are
custom videos, these are...
Guys, that's what
they're trading.
AJ, I don't...
I don't... I don't...
No, no, this is... Okay.
Show me the most recent one.
Nari.
The last one,
it's a small file.
It's smaller
than the other ones.
Oh, Jesus.
Just open it.
Okay.
Wait, wait, stop.
This can't be real.
Matias, go to the end.
Go all the way to the end.
Why is he looking
at the camera?
- That was it, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, then he might not
have her yet.
She's still in her bedroom,
all the other girls weren't.
Look, he chooses a girl,
shows her to the rest
of the group,
and waits for someone to pay.
And someone just paid,
so this is...
- this is the next girl.
- We have to report this, Nari.
Oh, we have her address
so just we can do
- a reverse phone look-up?
- Guys, I'll be right back,
- I'll be right back.
- Matias!
Matias, I'm not...
Look, please, I'm not...
No,
please just give me
one second.
Hello, hello!
Hello!
Kelly?
Kelly!
Kelly!
Hey! Hey, hold on, one second.
Hello?
Uh, yeah, we did.
Okay. Well,
he must have figured it out
'cause we got him.
Yeah, sure thing.
Thanks.
Sorry, that was
the pizza place.
I guess the driver called,
couldn't figure out
where we were or something,
I don't know. Hi!
- Is, um, is Amaya with you right now?
- No.
I mean, I just got in,
and I think Amaya's
in the shower.
Well, can you possibly get her
for me right now?
- Oh, wow! What?
- Uh...
- Okay, are you there?
- Hello, hello?
I can hear you.
Are you still there?
- I just can't...
- Kelly, I can't see you.
- I can't see you.
- Uh, where'd you go?
- Hold on a second.
- Yeah, is that
- on your end or...
- No, I think it's my end.
Yeah, sorry, hold on.
God! God! Kelly!
Kelly!
Kelly!
Kelly!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Amaya, Amaya, Amaya,
Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!
Hey! Come here, come here!
Can you see...
Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!
Don't go in there,
don't go in there,
don't go in there,
don't go... don't...
stop, stop, stop!
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Come here, come here,
come here.
Come here, come here.
Good, good.
Shit. I... it must...
it must be a bug,
or something.
Your computer called mine.
Um, uh, Kelly, Kelly's, um,
She's... she brought a...
she brought a guy home.
He's... she's... don't, don't,
don't disconnect.
I'll wait for you.
I'll wait... I'll wait for you.
Hey!
Hey!
Can you please sit down?
Please, please, just please
don't hurt her.
I'll do anything
you want me to do,
I will do anything, I promise.
How are you doing that?
How can I give... I can't give
you the laptop if I can't...
Wait just one second,
could you wait?
God.
Okay. Be calm. Just be...
Matias, Matias, Matias,
Matias, okay.
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, I'm here, I'm here,
- I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
- Listen, here's the plan, okay?
Nari is going to meet you down
at the police station,
there's one that's half
a mile away from your place.
You need to bring the laptop
with you, because every...
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
where's Damon? Where's Damon?
No, no, no, no, we need...
we need Damon.
- Damon! Damon! We need Damon!
- What? Matias!
- We need Damon right now! Damon!
- I'm sorry!
- Have we called the police or what?
- No, we're not calling police.
We're going to the police,
okay? Matias...
We don't have a lot of time, okay?
We need to help this girl.
- Matias!
- Yeah.
- I know there's a lot going on, okay?
- Uh-hmm.
But you need to trust us,
and you need to move fast.
Get the laptop,
go down to the police station.
- I will be there, okay?
- No.
- I have a friend that will meet us.
- We can't.
He knows how to deal
with this kind of situation!
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, you can.
- No, we can't... we can't...
It's not... it's not real.
What?
It's, um...
It's a... it's a game.
I made the whole thing up.
It's a game.
Lexx, you were... You were totally
onto me from the beginning.
Wait, I'm confused.
What?
Yeah, it's, um, it's a game.
It's my game. It's the one
I've been working on.
Damon, Damon knows.
I'm sorry, I'm lost.
I what now?
I told you I was... I told you
I was writing something.
- Matias, I'm...
- Uh, yeah, man, you said
you're writing something,
you didn't say playtesting
- or implementing.
- Well, yeah, I wanted to be...
I wanted to get an actual
response out of you, you know.
I mean, if you... If you knew what was
coming, then it wouldn't feel real.
That way I could, you know, I could
tell if it actually could work.
It is game night.
- Holy shit, man!
- Asshole.
- Oh, my God!
- I guess that means it was pretty good, huh?
Matias, this is not funny.
It's... actually, it's not,
it's not supposed to be funny.
- It's actually, uh, it's a horror transmedia.
- Oh, holy shit... It's an ARG.
- It's an alternate reality game.
- Exactly, yeah.
It's a... it's a test of what you would
do if the experience actually happened.
- Wow!
- Wow. That was bloody...
- Wait, AJ, were you in on this?
- Hell no!
I had no...
I had no idea about this.
Where... dude, where'd you...
Where'd you get those videos?
- That is some dark shit.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I know, I know,
it's just horror films.
What... hah! Okay, well,
you must have dug into some
really obscure shit,
because I have seen everything
and I haven't seen any
of those videos that you...
What if we'd called
the police?
Well, ideally you would...
you would register to play
with your cell number,
so if, you know,
by the time you logged in,
if you called 911,
it would hack your phone
and you would get a recording
like the bad guy hacked
into the phone.
Wow!
That, you know, it's crazy.
- Phew!
- Wait, the...
I went to that ASL class,
or the... or the...
or the first one,
the first one, at least.
And then... and the guy,
he was... he was...
he was teaching the class,
he was talking about
how hard it was
for a hearing-impaired person
to have a meaningful
relationship with someone
who couldn't sign.
And then... and how it builds
this special bond,
the ability to communicate
with someone
in a... in a special way
that would...
And you're right.
I'm really fucking scared,
Amaya.
I mean, I've never cared
about anyone or anything
the way I care about you.
The night we met at the bar,
I...
the music was so loud, and...
I saw you
and I remember thinking...
Oh, why bother?
That a beautiful person
wouldn't be able
to hear you anyway,
it's so loud.
I didn't know you were deaf.
I didn't know
that all that noise
wouldn't matter.
I mean,
that's what I want for us.
I want nothing else to matter.
I want nothing
to be in the way
of how much I love you.
I need you
to come here, okay?
I need you to get here
as fast as you can, okay?
Take the subway, okay?
Matias, what was
with them Roman numerals?
- Like, why the Roman numerals?
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you mean?
- That's weird.
Well, in the game,
instead of Charon's
just like being like a,
you know, Charon 4,
like the number four,
it had an IV.
And what about the girl
in the video,
the one who was next?
What about her?
Where'd you get the video?
Sorry, guys.
I got to take this.
It's the... it's the
Puppet Masters.
- No problem.
- Mute your mic, Lexx.
- Yeah.
- Mama!
Lexx, mute your mic!
- Oh, my God.
- She does this every time.
Yeah, you are louder than her.
Oh, my God. Mama.
I love how loud she is
on the phone to her mother.
It's just like,
straight up, like, bam.
I know.
You guys,
we do not have to play a game.
Let's just chat.
Let's just hang out,
and, um, you know,
what if... you guys,
maybe we should do
a guided meditation together.
Um, no.
I really did think
that was real for a second.
I'm gonna be honest.
I was totally there.
That was the most fun I've had,
in, like, two years.
Ugh. Good one.
Matias, Matias.
I have more questions, man.
Yeah, here,
I'm sorry. What's up?
Is it better, like,
that we did it as a team,
or as a solo experience?
And also...
and like how the hell
are you handling
the decision tree?
Like, say, if we had decided
to do something
with the bad guy's money,
if we'd taken it,
then how does that ripple
through the rest of the story?
Hello? Matia...
Oh, bloody hell,
he's away with the fairies.
- Matias!
- Hold on, I'll be...
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
How long are you
gonna be gone this time?
Are you there?
Are you there?
Can you hear me...
Hear me?
Good.
Then watch this.
You get the computer back
when I get Amaya back.
You get the money back
when I see on the news
that Erica Dunne is back home
safe with her parents.
You stupid motherfucker.
- All I want is my laptop.
- All I want is Amaya.
You don't understand
what you have gotten
yourself into.
- You killed Kelly!
- No, I didn't.
If you lay a hand
on Amaya or Erica,
you'll never see
any of that money.
Shut the fuck up and listen.
- They do not let girls go.
- What are you talking about?
The Circle,
the people I work with,
all the other Charon clients,
they monitor
all Bitcoin accounts.
They're gonna think
I'm trying to cash out.
Hello?
Hello, hello!
I lost your screen.
What's going on?
- What's happening?
- I don't... I don't know.
Oh, God, they pulled you
across the river, didn't they?
Hey, you know what?
I'm just... I'm gonna close it.
No!
Do not close it.
They're gonna know
you're not me.
Are they talking to you?
What are they saying?
They're saying...
they're saying recite the code.
Oh, God.
You just put a bullet
in our head.
You stupid... Okay.
Listen to me.
If they find out
that I lost that computer, they're
gonna kill me, they're gonna kill you,
and they're gonna kill anyone
else that might have seen it.
Just give me the code then.
Give me the money
back first and then...
No. Fuck you!
I am 10 feet away from Amaya,
and I will put a knife
in her throat
and disappear before
she even hits the ground.
I think you're a dead man
who lost $10 million.
This can be so easy.
I return Amaya,
you return the laptop,
and it'll be like nothing
ever happened.
No, you killed Kelly!
No, I didn't.
I just bashed her head.
She'll wake up and think
it was a robbery or something.
We have no time for this.
Return the money.
No, no, no. No, no, no. No.
When Erica Dunne is home safe,
then you get the money.
Okay.
You better hurry up.
They said this is
your last chance, Charon IV.
Okay, okay.
Type A-B-Y-S-S-U-S.
Second word:
A-B-Y-S-S-U-M.
Third word:
I-N-V-O-C-A-T.
Oh, wait, they're typing
in all caps.
- Should it be in all caps?
- Just fucking send it.
Okay. All right.
They're asking
why you drained the account.
Tell them I switched
from Bitcoin to Ethereum.
They're asking why.
It's a better exchange rate.
I got a tip.
Are they buying it?
Yeah, think so.
We'll be there soon,
you'll get Amaya.
And you'll get your laptop.
If I let Erica go,
they're gonna think
that she escaped and...
they're gonna lose faith,
they're gonna hold me liable.
Yeah, but you'll have
$10 million
to help you figure out
how to disappear.
If anything goes wrong
between here and there,
you're both dead.
He's lying to us.
He's back. Matias.
Yo. What?
- Okay, Nari, it is just a game.
- I found her. Okay?
- I found the girl, Matias, from your video.
- Found who?
She's real.
Her name's Erica Dunne.
She is real,
and she's really missing.
No, Nari, I know, I know.
I just... That was a...
Is it... Is it just
a placeholder or like...
Yeah. No, it is, it is,
it's a placeholder.
Dude, that's messed up, man.
Where did you even
get the video?
LiveLeak.
Yeah, someone on the inside
just must have...
must have leaked it
or something. I don't know.
Why would you use that video?
Okay, you know what?
Send the link.
Nari, that's ridiculous.
What?
Who's that?
Is that... Is that Amaya?
Turn on your video, love.
- Matias?
- No, no, no. Get him off.
- Matias, is that you?
- How do we get this person off?
Does anyone know
how we get this person off?
- Stop it.
- Wait, what's going on?
Come on, Matias.
Are you... you sneaky
little bastard.
He's playing us.
It's still the game.
No. No, guys, do... hey,
listen, do not click the link.
- Is this the link?
- Do not click the link.
Do you hear me?
Guys,
we didn't click the link,
but the video's playing anyway.
Same here.
- What the...
- What is it?
That was senior year.
That's December.
That's actually
McLeary's Pub, yeah?
- This is so cool.
- What does this have
- to do with the...
- I don't know.
Wait, guys,
where is Lexx?
She's probably still getting
a bollocking from her mom.
Lexx!
- What is that?
- That's Drill Bit.
- That's an exploit.
- What is an exploit?
It's a hacking tool.
Lexx!
Weird.
Are you calling Lexx
right now?
Yes,
I'm calling Lexx right now.
Wait, wait,
I thought she was...
Where is she?
Okay, I am lo...
Is she in on this, Matias?
What's going on?
Is that the German place?
No!
Did she just jump?
Oh, my God! Help!
Matias?
Was that Lexx?
Jeez.
Matias, please, talk to us.
This is just...
This is the game.
That wasn't her.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, how close are you?
How close... how close
are you to the subway?
Okay, okay, can you...
Can you do me a favor?
Can you... Can you stay
on the call?
And just keep your...
keep your phone in your pocket,
or whatever,
just stay on, okay?
Just trust me, okay?
And when you...
and I'll explain it to you
when you... when you get here,
all right?
Wait, no.
Nari, Nari, Nari, Nari,
- who are you calling?
- I'm calling Lexx.
Don't. Please,
do not call her right now.
- Okay? Please, just trust...
- Straight to voicemail.
Okay, guys. Hey, listen to me
for a second, all right?
No more calls, all right?
We just... you can...
you can leave your phones on,
- but just don't...
- Why?
There are automated calls,
it's part of the game.
I just... I just wanna make sure
that they're going through.
Bullshit, Matias.
Bullshit, okay?
- Okay, Nari, Nari.
- I have had enough.
I swear, if you don't start
talking now...
Matias is playing with you.
No. No, no,
I am calling the police.
Nari, Nari, please.
Do not do that.
- Please, hang, hang up the phone, Nari.
- No, I am not.
- I am gonna call the police right now.
- Calm down, guys.
Just give me one more second,
please, just one more second!
Guys, it's real.
The whole thing is real.
Just, just listen to me, all right?
The reason I said it was a game
is because he said if anyone
knew or if anyone disconnected,
- he would kill Amaya and then he'd come after all of you.
- Who?
Charon! Charon, Charon IV.
The guy whose laptop I took.
Okay, Matias. We get it.
I'm kind of done with this now.
Just... can you shut up
and listen to me, please?
Please. He can hear
and see everything, all right?
I mean, he, he found
Amaya's apartment.
She was the first person I called, so he
must have been able to track her somehow,
- or, or, or I don't know.
- You're serious? You're being serious right now?
She's on her way over here,
and he's following her.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
So, so there is no game.
This is all
actually happening?
Oh, my God. He-he killed Lexx.
I... No...
I-I-I don't know.
But he... he pushed her.
He-he-he bloody killed Lexx.
If he was with Amaya, then how
could he have done that to Lexx?
That's exactly the thing.
It wasn't him.
- It must have been one of the others.
- The other what?
The other... the Charons.
The ones who buy the videos,
the ones who pick the girls.
They must have figured out
- that the laptop got stolen.
- Oh, my God.
Guys, they're not just gonna
let that evidence float around.
So, all those videos,
they're all...
This is damage control.
They're doing a clean-up.
If they found Lexx, can they
find the rest of us, too?
I am ghosted online.
They can't find me.
Okay. He's right, he's right.
You need to get to AJ's house.
No, wait. Do not... No!
If these guys are that good...
they can track cell phones, they can track
cars. Do not lead them to my place.
Just listen to me, guys. You have to stay
online and act like nothing is wrong.
What we can't do is sit around, wait
till someone shows up at our door.
Wait. Wait, wait.
How do we know
he's not listening now?
Because of Facebook chat.
The green light,
it goes off
when she loses connection.
That's why I told her
to take the subway.
So when she'd lose connection
and went underground,
then I could tell you guys what
was fucking happening, all right?
Look, there's no service in the station,
but there's Wi-Fi in the subway cars.
So, as soon as she gets
on that train,
she's gonna have Wi-Fi again,
and so will he.
All right? Let's just...
Can we just... can we just...
Can we just play a game in the meantime,
act like nothing is happening?
- I'll give him the laptop when he gets here.
- Wait. If he's watching,
if he saw what happened to
Lexx, then doesn't he know?
I don't... I don't know.
He hasn't said anything yet.
So, uh, so it might have happened
when he didn't have connection or...
Yo, AJ. AJ, AJ, dude,
get the hell out of there.
- Get out. Get out of there.
- AJ, get out of there now.
- AJ... AJ, get out!
- AJ, get out.
Jesus Christ, Mom,
what are you...
God.
All right, all right, um,
all right, listen.
I transferred all of the money, all of
the money into my account, all right?
- Just temporarily.
- Why didn't you tell us?
Why, why didn't you try
and warn us?
How could I have
warned you, Damon?
If I did, Amaya would be...
And I just did it
as insurance, all right?
What, what about the laptop?
Isn't that enough insurance?
He's, he's not gonna hurt
Amaya when you got...
- Not just Amaya.
- You've got all his evidence!
Erica Dunne.
I told him he would get
the money back
once I knew
that she was free too.
Oh.
Matty, you are so dead.
What the hell else
was I supposed to do?
You saw what he does
to those people.
What'd you think was gonna
happen? You think he was just
gonna take the laptop
and walk away?
I know what
I'm asking you to do is...
Amaya's gonna be here
in five minutes,
and I can't promise you that
in those five minutes
that no one else is gonna
show up at your door,
but...
Guys, if we don't do this,
Amaya's...
Please.
Okay.
So, uh, who wants to go first?
I'll go.
Yeah, well, that one sucks.
Um, my gym teacher got fired
for adding blank
to the obstacle course.
Too much cocaine.
Velcro.
Uh, depression.
I like Velcro.
Thought depression
was pretty good.
All right, I'll go.
Uh, or do you wanna go, Damon?
- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
- Yeah? Um, all right.
Um, uh, in his new action,
in his new action comedy,
Jackie Chan must fend off
- ninjas while also...
- Hey, uh, Nari.
Uh, Nari, we're, we're,
we're trying to play.
- Uh, uh...
- Sorry.
A horse with no legs.
- What, uh, what is...
- Right?
Uh, go around...
going around punching people.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That's... you would pick that.
That's pretty good try.
Yeah.
Matias, give me access
to the laptop.
System Preferences,
Users and Groups,
Add User, make sure you give me
administrative access.
Wait, I'm just...
What are you gonna be doing?
I am gonna back-up
all the videos
and I'm gonna go
through location services,
in case we can find out
where the laptop's been,
then maybe we can find
the missing girl.
Wait, what do you mean?
Are we...
don't worry, okay?
What are you... what... no.
You guys, my friend
on the force,
he's coming over here, so...
Um...
Okay.
Um, blank.
Awesome in theory,
kind of a mess in practice.
Um, uh, the swim team,
all at once.
Okay, he's gone.
AJ, AJ, AJ,
as soon as Amaya
gets to my place,
you disconnect,
and you and your mom
get the hell out of your house.
All right?
You're the only one
who might not be safe.
Uh, Damon's in London,
they can't get to him.
And Nari's got a friend
on the force,
so, so the cops
are already on their way.
Okay, listen,
you guys cannot stay there.
No, no, no.
We're not going to.
Wait, wait, wait, uh...
Um...
Hey, um, Amaya's...
Amaya's gonna be late.
She says there's something
wrong with the subway.
Do you, uh... do you guys...
Can you guys play
a little bit longer?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I, um, totally.
- Okay.
- Hey, uh, Serena?
Serena, Nari.
- Serena?
- Guys.
Hello?
Uh, sorry, guys. Um, Nari's
skipping this round.
Uh... Matias,
can we play something else?
I'm getting, getting sick
of this game.
- How much longer?
- How much longer for...
Where did the subway
break down?
Let me... let me just...
let me ask.
Uh, it's, uh,
Western Boulevard.
Western Boulevard.
Not far. Uh...
What's going on
with Nari?
Bathroom.
She's not feeling well.
Might be a while.
Oh, you know what, fuck around
all you want, asshole!
- AJ! Dude!
- I got this shit all tied up!
- Do your worst!
- It's gone, it's gone, AJ.
I am so sick and tired
of all you sheeple not being
sick and tired enough
to get off your...
...sick and tired...
sick and tired...
sick and tired...
That's the way
to avoid data corruption
when using parallel SSD.
...a corruption...
corruption.
The protest going on at the,
uh, Great American Mall
in downtown for Flint,
Michigan, for that dirty water.
That went on,
so, I'm gonna pack up
all my stuff,
go downtown to the mall,
and have some fun.
Go downtown to the mall
and have some fun.
The beautiful Second Amendment
that is keeping it legal
to have a storehouse
of assault weapons
and explosives...
assault weapons
and explosives...
weapons and explosives...
911, please state
the nature of your emergency.
I am sick and tired
of all... the corruption.
Sir,
is this a real emergency?
I'm gonna pack up all my...
assault weapons
and explosives.
Go downtown to the mall
and have some fun.
Sir, can you
tell me your name?
Jeffcock is a family name.
Wait...
They made that call
two minutes ago.
AJ, you need to get out of...
Police!
We have a search warrant!
No, I...
AJ, just get on the ground
right now, all right?
AJ, get on the...
get on the damn ground!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground now!
- What's going on?
- Where is your son?
- The basement.
Wait, wait, wait. What's this
on the screen right here?
- What's on the screen?
- It's AJ's desktop.
- What is...
- They're into his computer.
They're uploading something.
- Police, open the door!
- I can't. I'm on the ground.
Open the door
or we'll break it down.
Okay. Okay, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.
- Stay down.
- Oh, my God!
Open the door!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
- No! AJ!
- No! No! No!
- AJ! No!
- Stay on the ground.
- No. AJ!
- Don't! AJ!
- No! No, no, no. Stay!
- No!
AJ! No! AJ!
No! No! No!
Gun, gun!
Oh, my...
Suspect down.
Oh, AJ.
No.
Fuck.
Matias, Damon...
Oh, my God!
Oh.
He's gonna kill Amaya
as soon as that train
reaches the station.
No, Nari is on her way there
right now.
- What?
- Yeah, she's gonna try
and get there before
they can get to her.
I can...
I can get there faster.
I'm gonna go now.
What...
what's going on?
Bye, love you.
So, here's the only thing.
We were gonna tell them
tonight,
and over Skype.
Do you wanna...
Do you wanna not
tell them tonight or,
- or what...
- No, it's perfect,
because this way,
Damon gets to be there
for the news.
AJ will be fine.
He's a big boy.
- Uh-hmm.
- He's a big boy.
Big boy that'll
probably show up a lot
in symbolic protests.
That's probably true.
On a white horse.
- Like, he would love that.
- Yeah.
Or with a boom-box.
Just John Cusack style.
And then we can put him
at your parents' table.
That'll be all the energy
we all need.
They're not coming, so....
You think they would magically
change their minds
and become modern?
I mean, I'm just...
their only daughter, so...
My mom.
No, your mom's gonna be okay.
- No. Nari.
- She's... No, she has to be.
She's never gonna leave
that hospital.
Well, then, then,
let's, let's get married
tonight in her room,
and, and we can bring
the paperwork and...
In the ICU?
And she'll be our witness.
Yes, yes.
I love that idea.
But it's not the point.
I don't want you
to have to choose
between me and them.
That's...
It's not fair.
I don't want you
to have to choose.
I don't want you
to have to choose.
Wait, it's... That's Nari.
Wait.
Who, who, who is that?
That's my mom.
Oh, God!
No, no, no! No, no!
I will do anything.
Stop this right now!
I will do any...
Please!
Please, don't do this.
You can have me.
I don't care,
just, please, stop!
Please, please,
please, please!
Oh, God!
No!
No, I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
No, no.
No.
I won't.
No!
Nari.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No.
No.
No!
Dammit!
No!
Oh, God!
No!
No!
Nari!
Nari!
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, Serena,
I'm sorry.
Serena, Serena,
get out of there right now!
Serena,
oh, get out of there.
Serena, get out of there
right now!
Oh, my God.
Listen to me.
I want you to listen to me,
whoever I'm talking
to right now.
Amaya, my...
She has nothing to do
with any of this, okay?
She hasn't even...
she doesn't even know
I found the laptop,
all right?
The guy who lost it...
the guy who lost it,
he's, he's on the subway train
with her.
He's wearing a gray hoodie,
this is all his fault, okay?
She has nothing,
nothing to do with it!
Please!
I'll delete everything, okay?
You'll have nothing
to trace back to me, I swear.
If, if you kill him...
I don't care what you do to me,
I don't care what you do to me,
but just please leave Amaya
out of this!
No, no, no,
no, no, no.
Baby...
okay?
What?
Slow, slow, slow, slow.
Slow.
Um...
Go, go.
Go, go.
All right, uh,
you're going to get her, man?
Yeah, I am.
All right, just make sure
you leave the computer open
because I got to keep
downloading the video files.
- Uh, okay.
- Now, Matias, just be careful,
- yeah?
- Yeah.
You're there, aren't you?
Guess what?
I have been recording.
I've got the whole thing.
You should have dealt
with Matias.
He was gonna give
the computer back.
He was gonna give it back
and forget the whole thing,
but that is not
what I'm gonna do.
You see this?
Do you know what this is?
This is coordinates.
This is everywhere
that computer has been.
This is going to lead them
to Erica Dunne,
and every single girl you took.
You are finished!
Oh, my God.
- Damon, Damon, what's up?
- Matias,
Matias, he didn't lose
the laptop.
Charon IV, he left it
there deliberately.
He wanted it to be found.
They all wanted it to be found.
See, it was a lure.
They were phishing.
Uh, from the moment you entered
your Wi-Fi password,
they were in, they've had
control this whole time.
Damon, I'm sorry,
but what are you...
It was a lie.
They're setting us up.
We did everything
they wanted us to do.
We moved the money.
We copied the videos.
They're gonna make it look like
it was us the whole time.
What? I... I'm sorry,
but how did you... hello?
Hello, hello?
Okay, I'll be right there.
I'm almost there.
I'm a second away.
I'm a second away.
Inside, where?
Inside where?
What building?
Amaya, what building?
What building are you in?
I told you to go to the park,
where we had
our first kiss, Amaya.
What pin... what pin
are you taking you about?
Amaya, I didn't...
I didn't send you anything.
No, no, no, no!
Amaya, Amaya, no!
Listen, listen.
Amaya, that's not me.
No, Amaya, that's not me!
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Don't listen to any of it.
Amaya, please.
Amaya!
Hello?
Hello, hello.
Hello!
Why are you doing this?
Why?
It is game night.
It is game night.
It is game night.
It is game night.
It is game night.
It is game night.
It is game night.
It is game night.
Help me!
I'm Erica Dunne.
Can you hear me?
