Salvation, eleven letters.
- Salvation?
- Yeah.
Second letter, E.
- Nah, sorry, can't help you.
- Redemption. Redemption.
R-E-D-E-M-P-T-I-O-N. No, doesn't fit.
- No?
- Oh, here's one for you.
"Connected to the knee bone, five letters."
Uh, tibia. Or the femur.
- Ah, it's femur.
- Yes!
And the femur's connected to the...
To the pelvis.
- The hipbone?
- Yeah.
And what's the hipbone connected to the...
The sacrum.
- And the sacrum's connected to the...
- To the lumbar vertebrae.
And the lumbar vertebra's connected to the...
Thoracic vertebrae.
And the thoracic vertebra's
connected to the...
The cervical vertebrae.
And the cervical vertebra's
connected to the...
The skull.
What about shoulder bone?
I think you missed it.
Actually, the shoulder bone is only
connected to the axial skeleton...
...via the sternoclavicular joint which is
where the collarbone meets the sternum.
Interesting fact, the shoulder is
held in place mostly by muscle...
...which is why it's so easily dislocated.
Mmm, love it when you talk medical to me.
Oh, how good's that champagne gonna be?
- Did you pack it?
- No.
I left it in the fridge...
...there was no room in the esky,
I was gonna put it all in a cooler bag.
No, that's alright.
We can stop in at a pub or something.
- Just the champagne?
- Uh, grab us a six pack?
Oh, shit!
- Oh, fuck.
- You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
- Hey, excuse me, mate?
- Hang on, mate. Banjo!
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're just, um...
...we're heading into Gungilee Falls.
Do you know what that road's like in there?
Yeah, you need a four wheel drive
to get into the falls.
- Ah, really?
- Yeah.
- You goin' camping?
- Ah, that's the plan, yeah.
- You ever been to Stony Creek?
- No, where's that?
It's upriver from Gungilee Falls.
There's a good camping spot there.
We just graded the road in,
so you won't have any trouble.
- Okay, thanks. We'll think about it.
- Yeah.
Cheers.
No worries, mate.
- Hey, how'd you go?
- Uh, it's not French, but it's got bubbles.
- That'll do.
- Yeah.
Every school holidays till Dad got sick.
Big campgrounds, mostly, you know.
Grown ups pissed and sunburnt,
kids running everywhere.
We loved it, but Dad preferred it
when we went somewhere quiet like this.
I think the last time I went camping
a guy set his tent on fire.
- What? When was that?
- High school.
This guy got covered in melted plastic
and he got third degree burns.
- He lost most of his hair.
- Jesus! Did you see it happen?
No, 'cause boys and girls were kept
separate but we heard him.
- Everyone heard him.
- That's awful.
Everyone thought he was smoking,
but he wasn't a smoker.
And I asked him how he started the fire.
He said he was playing with matches...
...but the flame wasn't big enough so he lit
a piece of paper and the tent just went up.
Mm.
He was already a pretty weird kid.
The scars just made it worse.
Uh... that's the turn off!
Fuck! Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Are you alright?
- Yeah? Yeah. Sorry.
No, it's okay.
Dickhead.
Looks like someone's beaten us to it.
- Maybe they're just here for the day.
- It's a long way to come just for the day.
It's beautiful.
Yeah, it is. It's pretty much
how I remember it except for the tent.
There's plenty of room.
We can set up over here.
Yeah.
Hey, it might not be such a bad idea
to have company on New Year's.
Well, what if they're dickheads?
Oh, well, then we'll just go to bed
and we'll have really quiet sex.
You can be quiet?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- If I have to.
- Mmm.
- Mmm?
- Alright, I'll get the stuff.
- I'll help.
- No, no, stay here. Relax.
- Won't take a minute, yeah.
- You sure? Okay.
Hey, Chook!
Chooka, Chooka, Chooka, Chooka!
- Chook!
- Hmm.
- Get up.
- Mm.
Where's Chook? Go get Chook!
Go get Chook! Go get Chook! Go get Chook!
Get the fuck off me, Banjo! Fuck off, Banjo!
Fuck you, German!
- Okay.
- Yeah, I think that's right.
- Hey, we make a pretty good team.
- Yeah.
Let's get married.
- You serious?
- Yeah.
Yeah, okay, let's do it.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
- I'm sorry, I surprised you there.
- Oh, no, don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry at all.
- Excuse me.
- Are you calling your sister?
Yes.
Actually I'm not,
because I've got no reception.
Well, you can consider this
your cooling off period, then.
Nuh. This is a done deal.
Good.
Get us something to eat too, eh?
I'm fuckin' starvin'.
Hey. Hey, baby.
Oi, how old do you think that Vicki girl is?
She's got a kid.
- So?
- So she's old enough.
Yeah.
Hey! Hey, Ollie, what's that?
Over there?
Who's that, Ollie?
- Boo!
- Oh!
That's Em.
We were just about
to send out a search party.
- I wasn't lost.
- See anything interesting?
Trees. Rocks. Water.
- What's for dinner?
- My special dhal and rice.
- Can I give him one?
- Not before dinner.
- Oh, shit!
- What have you done?
- I broke the ring pull.
- Don't know your own strength.
- No, I don't.
- There you go. It's got a can opener.
- Where did you get this?
- It was Dad's old knife.
There's not much call
to use it round the flat.
- What is that?
- That is an awl.
It's used for punching holes in leather.
Does this thing even have
a proper knife on it?
Yeah, it's even got a nail file.
- Oh, that's handy.
- Isn't it?
Hey.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, that's beautiful. Is it expensive?
Yeah. Mm. My husband's a doctor,
so he can afford it.
Well, lucky you.
Another sacrifice to the fire Gods?
I like watching them melt.
How far do you think it is to the falls?
- I thought it was 20 minutes.
- Looks further.
You know there was a massacre at the falls?
The local Kooris were all killed up there.
Driven over the edge
of the falls at gunpoint.
By who?
Settlers. They wanted them off their farms.
There aren't any farms near here.
Looks like there's some
cleared land above the falls.
Gungilee means weeping. The weeping water.
I don't like it here.
How about a change of tune?
- Any requests?
- No Simon and Garfunkel.
- I thought you liked Simon and Garfunkel.
- When I was five.
How about, El Condor Pasa?
- No.
- They didn't write that one.
- Dad.
- Okay.
How about this one? "Tis The Season."
Isn't there like a law where you
can't play carols after Christmas?
There's no statute of limitations on carols.
Anyway, Christmas was only four days ago.
- Everyone's a critic.
- That's my cue.
"The dog would bring it out
and lay it on the opposite side...
"...to where the man stood but would
not allow the man to catch him.
"Though it was only to wash the blood
of the sheep from his mouth and throat...
"...for the sight of blood
made the man tremble."
- That's dark.
- Yeah.
She published this in 1896.
That was the same year that Henry Lawson
published "While The Billy Boils..."
...but nobody's ever heard of bark painting.
Mmm.
God, I... I wish we published
this kind of stuff.
Hey, you remember when we first got
together, we'd stay in bed all weekend...
...and you'd read me
everything you were reading?
I loved it. It was like hearing you think.
Well, you're in luck.
I brought plenty of books.
Have you ever fired a rifle?
No.
- How about you?
- My Uncle's .22 at his farm.
At bottles.
- You hit anything?
- Yep.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You wanna come with us?
- I don't think so.
Oh, well. That's alright. That's your loss.
You know, you gotta make the most
of your opportunities, hey, Germ?
Give us a smile, German.
Oh, there you go.
Murundurra.
Murundurra. Get rid of it.
It's all gone.
He just gets a bit sensitive
about his appearance.
Watch out for that wildlife.
- I... I heard something.
- You alright? What?
No, I... definitely heard something.
- It was probably a possum or something.
- No, that wasn't a possum.
- Here, pass me the torch.
- Oh, God!
- What's the time?
- Um...
...it's nearly eleven.
- Where do you think they are?
- No, idea.
I'm sure they'll turn up soon enough.
- You following me, are ya?
- Yeah.
Hey, listen, you got any more photos
on that phone? Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me see.
Go on, I just wanna have a look.
Shepard and Fowler.
Thought only ladies went
to the toilets together.
Shouldn't you be on duty, constable?
Plainclothes. Shh!
Had another complaint about Banjo.
- From who?
- Doesn't matter.
Yeah, well, I put a fence in.
He doesn't run away anymore.
Yeah, it's the barking.
- Dogs bark.
- Listen, I said I'd have a word.
I've had a word, okay? You don't
want 'em taking out a nuisance order.
Have you boys made
any New Year's resolutions?
- Yeah.
- Well, what are they?
Well, I can't tell ya,
otherwise they might not come true.
I guess you're right.
Every year I resolve to do something
about this and every year it gets bigger.
Yeah?
Yeah, I know, I'm just in...
I'm just in the toilets. Hang on.
Anyway, Happy New Year, fellas.
- Stay out of trouble, eh?
- Yeah.
- Bit fuckin' late for that, eh, cuntstable.
- Yeah. Hey. Hey, the photos.
Oh, yeah.
You can play through 'em like a slideshow.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- Fuck!
- Are you so fuckin' stupid?
You wanna spend the rest of your life in jail?
I've been in there, and I'm not goin' back.
Yeah, yeah, you said
that fuckin' before, didn't ya?
Yeah, well, it's about time
you start fuckin' listening!
What happened out there, it stays out there.
You don't bring back photos
like a fuckin' tourist.
Are we clear?
Oh, yeah.
- Fuckin' better be.
- Yeah, we're fuckin' clear.
Why don't you just fuckin' relax?
Listen, there were people here earlier
and they're heading out to the falls.
- Well, who?
- I don't know. Young people.
- I've never seen them before.
- Oh, so?
No more of this fuckin' bullshit.
- It's okay. I got you.
- Em? Em, wake up.
- You're okay.
- It's okay, sweetie.
- Da... Dad?
- Just a bad dream.
It's okay.
You're okay.
It's okay. Go back to sleep.
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Six! Five! Four!
Three! Two! One!
Happy New Year!
My turn.
- Oh, fuck off!
- Dickhead.
- Happy New Year!
- Yeah, Happy New Year!
Fuckin' cunts.
Oh, shit. It's five past already.
- Oh! Oh, no, we missed it!
- Uh...
Wait, wait, wait, I can wind it back. Ready?
There we go. And...
- Ten. Nine.
- Ten. Nine.
- Eight.
- Seven.
- Six.
- Five.
- Four, three...
- Three...
Two, one...
Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, baby.
Oi!
Ah, shit.
Ah, shit.
Mm.
- Not too tight?
- No.
- Sure you don't wanna come?
- No, thanks.
- Last chance.
- I'm okay.
Okay.
Hang on. Photo.
- Hey.
- Huh-uh.
- Okay.
- Smile.
Okay, see you.
Ian!
Ian!
Sam?
Over here!
Check this out.
- This isn't right.
- Hmm.
I think we should get a ranger.
Yeah, there's a problem.
You probably did it
when you went into the ditch.
Yeah.
Why don't you go grab
our stuff while I change this?
Okay. Good luck.
Hello?
Hello?
Anyone there?
Have you heard of Imagery Rehearsal Therapy?
No.
I was reading about it online.
It's a treatment for nightmares.
Kind of cognitive behavioral therapy.
You help the person change the end
of their nightmare while she's awake...
...so it's not upsetting.
So, if you don't like the end
of the story, you just change it?
Something like that.
- Do they do it here? It sounds American.
- I don't know. I'll find out.
I shouldn't have told
that story about the massacre.
Mmm, she's a sensitive girl.
I remember when I was 16 my parents
wouldn't let me watch the news.
- I got too upset.
- You still get upset at the news.
Do you reckon that therapy will work?
I don't know, but it makes sense.
I mean, her nightmares aren't real.
Maybe we can help her change them.
- Come on!
- How's it going?
Ah! Think I've buckled it.
These are in pretty tight.
Watch your head.
- I'll get you some water?
- Yeah, thanks.
Ian!
Ian, help, quick!
I... I came back and he was just here.
Oh, God. Is he alive?
- Yeah, he's alive.
- Is he... is he hurt?
I don't know yet.
Hey, what's your name? Hey, hello.
- What can I do? What can I do?
- Get these clothes off and wash him.
Can you go to their tent and see if you can get
clean clothes and a towel? And nappy cream?
- Nappy cream, okay.
- And get some water!
Okay, water, water.
Hey, buddy, you've been in the wars.
Where's your mummy and daddy?
He could have just wandered off
and his parents have gone looking for him.
Maybe. He's been out here a few days.
You're okay.
- Maybe I could walk out to the road.
- How long would that take?
Maybe half a day.
- Can... can we just drive it like it is?
- No, no, it's too rough.
It's not gonna make it.
What about their car?
Is it...
The keys aren't here.
I'm going to check the tent.
Okay.
I might not have to go
all the way out to the road.
Maybe there's reception
once I'm out of this valley.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.
- Yeah, I know.
- If he wakes up just give him fluids.
As much as he'll take. And check his nappy?
I'll be back as quick as I can.
- Alright. Okay. Thank you.
- Alright?
What is it?
Here you go, boy.
Hey, Chook.
Chook?
Oh, fuck!
Banjo!
- Car trouble?
- Uh, you have to help us.
- We found this boy.
- He's just... he's here in the car.
- He okay?
- Yeah, he's pretty dehydrated.
He has a few cuts and, and scratches
but nothing major as far as I can tell.
- Yeah, Ian's a doctor.
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's his folks?
No sign of them.
There's just this car and a tent.
But the tent's all messed up inside.
- Yeah, how long you've been here?
- Since yesterday.
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.
I was here three days ago.
- They were okay then.
- You met them?
Yeah. I was here to count the piggy's.
Yeah, the park's full of wild pigs.
Gonna do a cull.
Yeah. I saw one last night.
It was into our food.
So, are you a ranger?
No. I'm a hunter.
- You been up to the falls?
- No.
They said they were going to the falls.
- Maybe they got into trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
Well, that track's pretty bad.
Yeah, last year a guy fell, broke his back.
- It was a week before they found him.
- Well, what about the tent? It's trashed.
Uh... it could've been a pig.
Maybe it went in there looking
for food, got stuck, freaked out.
I seen a wild boar wreck a tin shed.
We don't have any reception on our phones.
Do you have a phone, or a radio we can use?
No, sorry.
Right, well, what are we waiting for?
I think we should go.
- Oh, hang on. What about his folks?
- They could be anywhere.
Or they could be where
they said they were going.
Look, river bend in a horseshoe here.
We head over the hill. Take ten,
fifteen minutes to get to the falls.
We'll have a look around, walk the track back
and we'd be back in less than an hour.
But if we leave now it's gonna be dark
before someone gets back here.
I mean, you're the doctor.
What do you reckon?
Okay.
Okay.
- I'll get my first aid kit out of the back.
- You got a full kit?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got everything
just in case someone gets into trouble.
- He'll probably be okay till we get back.
- Yeah?
- Whoa.
- Hey, what's that for?
Well, if we run into a pig,
I don't wanna get gored.
- Have you ever fired a rifle?
- Uh, no.
Yeah. You'd better carry this then.
You have any trouble, you just hit
that horn and we will come running.
Okay.
- You okay?
- Yeah, yep. Back as quick as we can.
Make sure you find them.
Yeah, we'll find them.
Hurry back. Please.
Banjo.
Oi!
Check this out.
Well, now's your chance.
- Right here?
- Or somewhere more private.
The last time you took a girl somewhere
more private you ended up in jail.
Yeah, but I learnt from my mistakes.
You gotta make the most
of your opportunities.
Yeah, okay.
- You stay here and keep an eye on the girl.
- Hey, where are you goin'?
I'm gonna go and see if we're alone.
Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
- Did I scare ya?
Um, where's Mum and Dad?
Don't know.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Just relax, okay?
- Just get away from the car.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just get away!
Why don't you come out?
Come on.
Stop it!
Stop it now!
Stop it!
Is that our car?
Yeah.
What's she doing?
I don't know. Maybe she saw a snake.
Jesus, leave me alone!
Oh, for fuck's sake.
- You take Ollie.
- Okay. Come on.
- I'll see you back there.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Leave me alone!
- What are you doing?
- Well, she started it.
- It's just a bit of fun.
- A bit of fun? Fuckin' idiot.
Where's he going?
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car
before I blow your fuckin' head off.
Now! That's it.
We're just gonna go for a little ride, okay?
Huh? Now come on.
Now!
Oh, fuck.
- Get away from her!
- Dad!
Let him go!
Okay, it's okay.
Ollie, I'm just going to put you down
for a little bit, okay?
Good boy.
Don't get out. It's okay.
- Let me go!
- Fuckin' shut up!
- Let me go!
- Hey!
Run, Em!
The next one goes in his head.
I don't know how you catch
any pigs in all this.
Oh, you send the dog out.
Or even better, you set a trap.
- Let 'em come to you.
- You're allowed to use traps?
You talking about
those old steel-jawed things?
I guess so, yeah.
They're illegal.
Won't work on a pig, anyway.
Pigs are too big.
You gotta use a cage.
A pig goes in, door closes...
...can't come out.
And the trick is having the right bait.
Corn and strawberry milk powder
works pretty good.
- Strawberry milk powder?
- Yeah.
Piggy's got a sweet tooth.
- Wanna tie their feet?
- Nah. We're goin' for a walk.
Stand 'em up.
Stand 'em up.
- Do you wanna bring the dog?
- No, Banjo stays here.
'Cause he'll tell us if anyone turns up.
Let's walk 'em up the path.
Come on, move.
Move it.
# Two little ducks went out one day #
# Over the hill and far away #
# Mother Duck said quack quack quack quack #
# But only one little duck came back ##
Hey!
They got a little kid.
Where is he?
Don't worry, we'll take care of him.
Here!
Chook!
You wanna do her again?
Nah!
Yeah, well, grab your gun.
- What for?
- What do you think?
- Nah.
- Grab your fuckin' rifle.
You stay there.
We're gonna play a game.
Age before beauty.
Now sit still. Sit still.
Let's see how good you are.
Your shot.
I said, sit still.
Alright, stay still.
Good shot!
Your turn.
You stay still.
Just stay still, alright?
I said stay still!
My turn.
Your go.
Now, you set it up.
Maybe you should get
your eyes tested, old man.
Call it a draw.
What about her?
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, grab the drinks, Chook.
Come on.
Fuck.
No, she's dead too. We gotta...
we gotta get back now.
- Where's the mother?
- What?
The mother.
- She isn't here.
- We gotta get help.
- No.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Look! She went that way.
Fuck.
Excuse me, we found a little boy.
We've been here since yesterday
but his parents are missing.
Where's your man?
He just went looking for them with, um...
I don't know his name.
Can you hear me?
- Ollie?
- Ollie's okay. Ollie's okay.
Alright, you're gonna be okay, I'm a doctor.
Alright? Now, can you tell me your name?
Huh? What's your name?
Fuckin' Chook.
What are you doing? What's going on?
Oh, fuck.
She wanna fuckin' run?
Go get her!
Oh, fuck. I wish German was here.
The look on your face.
Are you gonna shoot me now too?
Nah.
You can watch me fuck your girlfriend first.
Get up.
Fuck!
Fuck, Banjo!
Get off him, Banjo!
Oh, fuck!
Ah!
Gotcha.
Oh, Sam.
- Chook.
- Oh, fuck. Fuck.
I'm sorry, Germ.
Germ, I'm so fuckin' sorry. I didn't...
Shh, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.
Sam.
Shh! No, no, no, no, no. Oh, God.
Move, move, move!
Quicker.
Keep going.
Yeah, stay there.
- Just shut that fuckin' kid up!
- Shoosh, please, shoosh.
- Here. Give him here.
- I'll make him quiet.
- Give me the fuckin' kid.
- I'm sorry.
- No! No, come on, no, no, no, no, no!
- Let him go!
Ian, help me! Help me! Do something, please!
Let him go!
No!
Oh, my God!
- Stay there!
- Oh, my... Oh, my God! No, let me...
Don't move or I'll put
a fuckin' bullet in your head.
Please, please, don't.
Tell me what to do, eh?
- Oh...
- Fi... finish me, Chook.
- No, I can't finish you, Germ.
- Please, please.
Finish me.
Please.
Goodbye, Germ.
Get up.
Get up!
Now we'll be waiting by the rocks!
You know the place!
Move. Go.
Quick!
The doctor's taking his time.
Maybe he needs some encouragement.
What'd you reckon?
Let's hear a scream.
- Scream.
- No.
No?
- Scream for me.
- No, no, no, please, please, please.
Please, please, please.
- Scream.
- Please, please.
Please, please, don't.
I want you to scream.
- Scream.
- No.
- Scream, scream. Yeah.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
Yeah, scream, scream.
Don't fuckin' look at me.
Scream. You fuckin' scream!
Fuck. Oh, come on.
Come on, Ian, think.
Think, come on.
Fuck!
That fuckin' chicken-shit bastard!
Fuck!
We're going after him.
Fuckin' cunt!
Get up! Pull up your fuckin' pants.
Come on!
Come on!
Banjo. Come on! Banjo, come on!
Oh, you stupid fuckin' dog!
Come on!
Come on!
Oh, what a chicken-shit boyfriend you've got.
He run off.
- He saved Ollie.
- What?
Well, he didn't run off, he saved Ollie.
Oh, he hasn't saved anyone yet.
Get off!
Oh, fuck!
Help! Help!
Hello!
- Hang on, I'm coming.
- Mate, I need your help.
Hang on, hang on.
Can't you go any faster?
Going as fast as we can, mate. Sorry.
Oh.
VKG-25, what is your location, over?
Yeah, we're still on our way in.
This track's slow, going in the dark, over.
Keep me posted, over.
Will do. Over and out.
Oh.
- Yeah, that's Fowler's ute.
- Okay.
- Sam.
- Stay in the car.
Ian.
Just stay there.
It's okay.
Oh, God! Oh! Oh!
God!
Oh, fuck! Oh, God!
Hello, doctor.
Hey!
Aah! Oh, fuck!
Here's what's gonna happen.
You are gonna drive me out of here...
...or I put a bullet in his head!
It's your choice!
I'll count to ten then.
Oh, fuck.
- One.
- Please.
- Two.
- You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.
- Three! Four! Five!
- Alright.
- Six!
- Sam, no...
Seven!
Eight!
- I don't think she's gonna come, mate.
- Nine.
Wait! Wait.
Please.
Ah! Stay there! Stay there. Don't move.
Go.
You're gonna take him...
