Hey, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be
upstairs sleeping.
Stanley keeps waking me up.
Oh, ho, ho. I get it.
Boy, are you getting heavy.
Don't let her pull more
than her usual nonsense.
Two stories,
two glasses of water.
Jack, you're going
to miss the plane.
OK. Cricket,
you listen to me.
Go upstairs with Mrs. Wheeler now
and go to sleep.
On my business trip,
I'll get Stanley
a little brother.
Will you promise?
I promise.
Can I get you anything, sir?
No, thank you very much.
If you try and get sleep,
the flight will go faster.
I can never sleep on a plane.
Turbulence.
Pardon?
Turbulence...
Solar radiation
heats the Earth's crust,
warm air rises,
cold airs descends.
Turbulence.
I don't like that.
Oh. Well, try to sleep anyway.
Dr Ryan?
Jack, boy,
get yourself in here.
Jesus!
You look like hell.
Thank you very much, Admiral.
Want coffee?
I think I need some coffee.
I'm not going to ask you
how your flight went.
When's the last time
you got some sleep?
Oh, I don't know.
This thing's still
on London time.
Milk and sugar?
Milk and sugar.
So how's Caroline?
Last time I saw her
was at your granddad's place
in Maine, wasn't it?
She's fine.
Sends you her best.
And Sally?
She's fine.
What is she now, 3?
Ah, no, she's
a very precocious 5.
She announced to Caroline
and I the other day
that her life would be
considerably less lonely
if we were to buy her
a baby brother.
But she decided
it would be enough
if we were to
buy one for Stanley.
Who's Stanley?
Uh... Stanley's a bear.
All right.
What's important enough
to get you on a plane
in the middle of the night?
British lntelligence obtained
these pictures two days ago.
She's the Red October,
the latest typhoon class.
Big son of a bitch.
12 meters longer than
the standard typhoon.
3 meters wider.
The captain's name is Ramius.
One of yours?
Yeah. I did his bio last year.
He's taken out the lead boat
in each new sub class
for 10 years.
Fairly good
political connections.
Trained most of their
attack boat skippers.
The Russians call him
Vilnius Nastavnic...
the Vilnius schoolmaster.
What are these doors?
Those doors, sir, are the problem.
I don't know what they are.
Neither do the British.
Perhaps our friends in Murmansk
have come up with something new.
With your permission,
I'd like to show these to someone.
Do you know Skip Tyler?
Sub driver.
Was. Clipped by a drunk driver.
Lost his leg.
He's teaching at the academy,
consulting for Navy labs.
Clearance?
Top secret or better.
Margie, have a car for Dr Ryan
downstairs in 10 minutes.
A satellite caught Red October
in Polijarny lnlet this morning.
Do you hear it?
No.
Beaumont, at Cal Tech
we used to do this
in our sleep.
You hear it now?
Wait a minute.
Maybe.
Um...
It's buried in surface clutter?
Yes.
I should go to SAPS?
Correct, Seaman Beaumont.
Signal algorithmic
processing systems.
Give it a week,
and you'll be
teaching at Cal Tech.
So...
Iike Beethoven on the computer,
you have labored to produce...
a biologic.
A what?
A whale, Beaumont.
A whale...
A marine mammal
that knows a hell
of a lot more about sonar
than you do.
Kill the SAPS.
Train over to 2-6-9
and let's try it again.
If he gets to ragging
on you too bad,
ask him about Pavarotti.
We don't have time
for sea stories.
I was in the middle
of teaching Seaman Beaumont
the intricacies
of modern sonar. Now...
I ain't chief of the boat.
I'm Sheena,
Queen of the Jungle.
Cob, please.
Come on, Cob. Tell me.
OK. Fine. Go ahead.
Ahem... Seaman Jones here,
he's into music in a big way.
He figures this whole boat
is basically just his own
personal, private stereo set.
He gets this
piece of Pavarotti...
Paganini.
Whatever.
Paganini.
This is my story, OK?
Tell it right.
Pavarotti's a tenor.
Paganini was a composer.
OK. So he's got this music,
and he's got it out
in the water.
He's listening
on his headsets,
happy as a clam.
Then all hell breaks loose.
A slew of boats
out of San Diego...
Including one
way out at Pearl.
Including one
way out at Pearl.
All of a sudden,
they start hearing...
- Pavarotti.
- Pavarotti...
coming out of their asses.
What do I do?
I got it.
Conn. Sonar.
New contact, bearing 0-9-7.
Designate contact
number Sierra 3-5.
Captain, aye.
What've you got, Jones?
Distant contact,
probably submerged.
It's a wild guess,
but I'd say we hit a boomer
coming out of the barn.
Could be a missile boat
out of Polijarny.
OK. Start your track.
I'll be there in a minute.
Sonar, aye.
...Armageddon.
And the seventh angel
poured forth his bowl
into the air,
and a voice cried out
from heaven, saying,
"It is done".
A man with your responsibilities
reading about the end
of the world. Huh.
And what's this?
"I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds".
It is an ancient Hindu text
quoted by an American.
American?
Mmm.
He invented the atomic bomb,
and he was later accused
of being a Communist.
You wrote and underlined
these passages?
No.
This book belonged to my wife.
I keep it
for sentimental value.
I'm sorry, comrade Captain.
Your wife was...
a beautiful woman.
Her death was... unfortunate.
I'm only doing my job.
It is my responsibility.
How many agents did the KGB
put aboard my boat?
Your boat, Captain?
Yes.
This vessel belongs to
the people of the Soviet Union.
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU
has agents aboard,
I will be the last to know.
I suggest we open
our orders, Captain.
Certainly, comrade.
"From commander...
strategic submarine forces
red banner northern fleet".
We're to proceed north
to grid square reference 54-90
and rendezvous with
alfa submarine Konovalov.
Captain Tupolev's boat.
You know Tupolev?
I know he descends
from aristocracy
and that he was your student.
It's rumored he has
a special place
in his heart for you.
There's little room in Tupolev's heart
for anyone but Tupolev.
Having made contact,
we are to run a series of drills.
Tupolev will hunt us
while we test our ship.
Having evaluated
the operational readiness
of the caterpillar drive,
we are to return to Polijarny
on or about the 16th
of this month.
Captain, this is
an historic moment.
I'd like to make a request.
Before you proceed, comrade...
I know it's not protocol,
but would you permit me
to post our orders
and inform the crew
of our mission?
Aah!
Where I'm going...
you cannot follow.
Dr Petrov, report
to my cabin immediately.
There's been
a dreadful accident.
Hey, buddy!
Daniel, got any more rods?
More rods!
Listen to me.
There's no cradle underneath it.
Get it over.
Relax!
Stop being an old maid.
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?
All right. Bring her up.
What? What?
Ryan!
Who let you in here?
Hey, Skip,
what, have they got you
playing with models now?
Ahh!
Damn it, Bill!
Tell them to slow down!
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
Calm down, will you?
It's not a model. The DSRV.
Rescue sub.
I know what it is.
What are you doing with it?
We're rigging it
with a generic docking collar
so it'll mate with
British, German...
just about anybody's sub.
We can get it
anywhere in the world
in 24 hours.
How's your back?
It's fine.
Have you got a minute?
Bigger than
a regular typhoon.
What are these doors?
You don't miss much, do you?
Those are too big
to be torpedo tubes.
Would you launch
an ICBM horizontally?
Sure. Why would you want to?
They're symmetrical.
Right down
the long axis of the sub.
How about a towed sonar array?
Nope.
Too close to the screws.
I'll be...
This...
This could be a caterpillar.
A what?
Uh, a caterpillar drive.
Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.
You follow?
No.
It's like a...
a jet engine for the water.
Goes in the front,
gets squirted out the back.
Only it's got no moving parts,
so it's very, very quiet.
Like how quiet?
It's doubtful our sonar
would even pick it up.
And if it did,
it would sound
like whales humping
or a seismic anomaly.
Anything but a submarine.
We messed with this
a couple of years ago.
Couldn't make it work.
They really built this?
This isn't a mock-up
or anything?
She put to sea this morning.
When I was 12,
I helped my daddy build
a bomb shelter in our basement
because some fool parked
a dozen warheads
90 miles off the
coast of Florida.
This thing could park
a couple of hundred warheads
off Washington and New York,
and no one would know
anything about it
until it was all over.
Are you all right, Captain?
Oh, yes.
It's just to die for something
as petty as slipping on tea.
You're blaming yourself, Captain.
It was an accident.
You'll feel better
when we put in.
Put in?
Well, to base, Captain.
We cannot go on without
a political officer.
Doctor, this is a combat vessel
of the Soviet Navy,
and I'm a senior combat officer.
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.
Seaman.
Come here.
Come here.
Your name?
Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.
Good. I want you and the doctor
to witness this.
I'm removing
the political officer's...
missile key...
carry on...
and I'm keeping it myself.
Captain, I think
we should report this
to Red Fleet Command.
I'm afraid
that's impossible, Doctor.
Our orders are
for strict radio silence.
Orders, sir.
That's all, Loginov.
Yes, sir.
This is most unnerving,
Captain.
The reason for having
two missile keys
is so that no one man...
may...
May what?
May arm the missiles.
Perhaps I should keep the key.
Thank you.
That'll be all, Doctor.
Captain, l...
When I address the crew,
then you will understand.
Yes, sir.
Petrov.
Yes, sir?
I will try to forget
your comments
when I present my report.
Thank you, sir.
Holding steady on 3-1-0.
12 knots
at about 20,000 yards.
Have you got a make on him?
Computer's chewing on it, sir.
Twin screws.
The plant noise
sounds like a typhoon.
I'd say we got
a new boat, sir.
Tommy, I miss something
on the boards?
Sub plant hasn't said
anything about it.
Hmm.
All right.
How many typhoons
we got in the computer?
Six, sir.
OK. Call this guy
Typhoon Seven.
Start a tape on him.
See if we can work
in a little closer.
Yes, sir.
Won't he hear us?
Not if we stay in his baffles,
Seaman Beaumont.
Not if we stay in his baffles.
Come in behind his propeller,
and he's deaf as a post.
Any sonar contacts,
Mr. Kamarov?
No contacts, Captain.
The sonar is clear.
Good. Do we have any
surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?
No contacts, sir.
Scope is clear.
Good. Then it is time
I explain our orders
to the crew.
Comrades, this is your captain.
It is an honor
to speak to you today,
and I'm honored
to be sailing with you
on the maiden voyage
of our motherland's
most recent achievement.
And once more,
we play our dangerous game,
a game of chess,
against our old adversary...
the American Navy.
For 40 years,
your fathers before you
and your older brothers
played this game
and played it well.
But today,
the game is different.
We have the advantage.
It reminds me of the heady days
of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin,
when the world trembled
at the sound of our rockets.
Well, they will tremble again
at the sound of our silence.
The order is engage
for silent drive.
Aye, sir.
Ballast control,
open outer doors.
Yes, open outer doors.
Diving command.
Engage caterpillar
and secure main engines.
Doors opening, Captain.
Comrades, our own fleet
doesn't know
our full potential.
They will do everything
possible to test us,
but they will only test
their own embarrassment.
We will leave our fleet behind.
We will pass through
the American patrols,
pass their sonar nets,
and lay off their largest city
and listen
to their rock 'n' roll
while we conduct missile drills.
Then...
And when we are finished,
the only sound they will hear
is our laughter
while we sail to Havana,
where the sun is warm
and so is the comradeship.
Cryogenic plant
coming on line, Captain.
A great day, comrades.
We sail into history.
Caterpillar engaging.
Caterpillar engaging,
Captain.
What happened?
I don't know.
Full rudder left.
Full rudder left.
Navigator.
New course, 2-5-0.
Yes, new course, 2-5-0.
Steering 2-5-0.
Yes, course is 2-5-0.
Sonar contact, Captain.
Port quarter.
Close aboard.
American,
Los Angeles class.
American. Captain, we...
Course 3-1-0.
Is the American
turning to follow us?
No, Captain.
The American is continuing
in his original course.
He's continuing northwest.
He can't hear us.
And the singing?
Let them sing.
What are you talking about?
Check your gear.
Running diagnostics now,
Captain.
Sonar is working, Captain.
The Russian disappeared.
One minute, he was steady
4,000 yards off the bow,
and then he was gone,
and for a second,
I thought I heard...
Heard what?
I thought I heard singing, sir.
Singing?
Yes, sir.
Yah, yah.
Yah, yah, yah.
Yah, yah.
Good morning, sir.
I hope we had a lovely evening.
Yah, yah.
A little chilly this morning.
There's a letter there
from Marko Ramius.
Ah, Marko.
Yes?
No. This is Dr Ryan.
What the hell happened?
Come on.
This is no longer
a research project.
I got a line on those doors.
You know what they are?
A nearly silent
propulsion system?
How did you know that?
The captain of the sub
following her radioed in.
Thing disappeared
right in front of him,
and that's only
the half of it.
Read.
Oh! I'm sorry.
Got your I.D.?
My God, this is unbelievable.
The Kirov, three Sverdlovs,
the Kiev, the Minsk.
They've sortied
their whole bloody fleet.
That's about the size of it.
Good afternoon, Admiral.
Afternoon, Matthew.
Where are we going anyway?
Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt,
President's National
Security Adviser.
Most of the Joint Chiefs
will be there,
along with a few other people.
Who's giving the briefing?
You are.
The yeoman will
have all the slides
Iaid out for you.
So all you got to do...
Look.
No one understands
this material better than you.
Just give him
a rundown on the sub
and a precis of the
stuff in your hand.
He's liable to ask
some direct questions.
Give him direct answers.
Tell him what you think.
Come on.
Ahem.
Ahem.
Uh, gentlemen,
the last 24 hours
have seen some extraordinary
Soviet naval activity.
The first to sail
was this ship,
we believe
called the Red October
in reference to
the October Revolution of 1917.
A variant
of the typhoon class,
she's some 650 feet long
and 32,000 tons
submerged displacement...
roughly the same size
as a World War Il
aircraft carrier.
We believe that these doors,
here on the bow
and again on the stern,
enclose a unique
propulsion system...
a magneto-hydrodynamic drive,
or caterpillar,
that would enable the sub
to run virtually silent.
It is possible
that this new drive system
allowed the captain,
a man named Ramius,
their senior and perhaps
most respected commander...
Do we have
his picture available?
Allowed Ramius to elude
one of our attack boats,
the Dallas, which trailed Red October
from harbor this morning.
It is also possible
that this drive system,
if operable,
could render the Red October
undetectable to
our Sosus warning nets
in the Atlantic.
Mr. Ryan, would you
characterize this
as a first-strike weapon?
Uh, that is a possibility, sir.
It is designed
to approach by stealth
and to shower its target
with multiple
independent warheads
with little or no warning
before impact.
Goddamn thing's made
to start a war.
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.
About the same time
the Dallas lost contact,
there were additional sailings
from Polijarny and from
Leningrad on the Baltic
and from the Mediterranean.
There are now
some 58 nuclear submarines
headed at high speed
into the Atlantic.
This afternoon a satellite pass
over Polijarny
found heat blooms
in the engineering plants
at the Kirov, the Minsk,
and more than 20 other
cruisers and destroyers,
indicating they were
preparing to sail.
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.
Admiral Greer,
your conclusions.
Well, sir,
the data support
no conclusions as yet.
The absence of activity
in the Pacific
suggests this could
be just an exercise.
It may have nothing to do...
Suppose it's not an exercise?
Suppose this
is the beginning
of a move against NATO?
NSA can speak for that,
Mr. Pelt.
I must emphasize the extreme
sensitivity of this information
and that it not leave the room.
Before sailing, Captain Ramius
sent a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin,
Chairman of the Red Fleet
northern political directorate.
That's her uncle.
Whose uncle?
Ramius' wife.
Padorin's her uncle.
Now, the contents
of the letter are unknown,
but Admiral Padorin
immediately demanded
a meeting
with Premier Chernenko,
and within minutes
of that meeting,
the Soviet fleet sailed
with orders
to find Red October
and sink her.
Sink her?
My God. They've got
a madman on their hands.
If it gets within
500 miles of the coast,
we'll have less than
two minutes' warning.
Today's the 23rd, isn't it?
What?
Is today the 23rd?
Yeah.
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch!
You wish to add something
to our discussion, Dr Ryan?
Well, sir,
I was just thinking
that perhaps there's another
possibility we might consider.
Ramius might be
trying to defect.
Do you mean to suggest
that this man has come...
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.
Well...
Ramius trained most
of their officer corps,
which would put him
in a position
to select men
willing to help him.
And he's not Russian.
He's Lithuanian by birth,
raised by his paternal
grandfather, a fisherman.
And he has no children,
no ties to leave behind.
And today is
the first anniversary
of his wife's death.
Come on.
You're just an analyst.
How can you read his mind?
I know Ramius, General.
He's nearly a legend
in the submarine community.
He's been a maverick
his entire career.
I actually met him once
at an embassy dinner.
Have you ever met
Captain Ramius, General?
Admiral Hollis,
how long before Ramius
could be in a position
to fire his missiles at us?
Four days.
All right.
I'll brief the President.
That will be all, gentlemen.
Dr Ryan,
would you stay
for a moment, please?
I said speak your mind,
Jack, but Jesus...
You slammed the door
on the general pretty hard, Jack.
That was not my intention, sir.
Oh, yes, it was.
He was patronizing you,
and you stomped on him.
In my opinion,
he deserved it.
Listen, I'm a politician,
which means I'm
a cheat and a liar,
and when I'm
not kissing babies,
I'm stealing
their lollipops,
but it also means
that I keep my options open.
So let's assume for a minute
that you're right
and this Russian
intends to defect.
What do you suggest
we do about it?
We definitely
grab the boat, sir.
Hey, wait a minute.
We're not talking about
some stray pilot with a M.I.G.
We're talking about several
billion dollars' worth
of Soviet state property.
They're going to want it back.
Maybe it's enough then
just to get some people
onboard and inspect it.
Call it whatever
you want to...
a Coast Guard
safety inspection.
So how do we proceed?
First, we need to contact
the commanders
in the Atlantic directly.
The Russians get
one whiff of this
through the regular
communications circuits,
the game is up.
Second, we figure out
how we can help them.
We devise a plan to intercede,
ready to go at a moment's notice.
Third, somebody's got to
go make contact with Ramius
and find out what
his intentions really are.
OK.
When do you leave?
Ha ha ha!
Wait a minute.
The general was right.
I am not field personnel.
I am only an analyst.
You're perfect.
I can't ask any
of these characters to go.
They don't believe in it.
They'd never stake
their reputation
on a hunch, whereas you...
Are expendable.
Something like that.
I'll give you three days
to prove your theory correct.
After that,
I have to hunt down Ramius
and destroy him.
Will you do it?
Mother of God!
Secure the mast!
All ahead, 2/3!
Set depth to 900 meters!
What is it?
What's happened?
Mast secured, helm at 2/3.
Commence heading 2-0-5.
2-0-5, affirmative.
These orders
are seven bloody hours old!
Sitting on the bottom
Iike an addled schoolboy.
Captain...
Passing at...
All ahead, flank.
All ahead, flank.
Inquire of the engineer
about the possibility
Seven hours.
The entire fleet is after him.
Leveling at 900 meters.
Very well.
Captain, Engineer reports
but not recommended.
Go to 105 on the reactor.
Captain, what is it?
Where are we going?
We're going to
kill a friend, Yevgeni.
We're going to kill Ramius.
If you like borscht,
perhaps,
but I've eaten better
in an oiler's galley.
My wife said to the waiter,
"Where did this man
learn to cook,
Afghanistan?"
So then we went
on to the Bolshoi,
the ballet,
to see this new girl
as Giselle.
You remember
how beautiful she was.
She just married
a factory manager.
Excuse me, Doctor.
Do you have the figures
for the latest batch
of radiation tests?
Now?
Now.
Perhaps you could bring
the preceding set as well...
for comparison.
Thank you, Doctor.
It will take him some time.
Before we begin, Captain,
I'd like to know
exactly what happened
to Putin.
He didn't slip
on his tea, did he?
I don't think I like
your tone, Slavin.
What the hell's my tone
got to do with it?
We're risking our lives here.
Putin could've caused
complications.
Did you think he would
just go away and sulk
while we carried out our plans?
Are you saying
he was murdered?
My God.
Stop whining, Yuri.
How can you justify murder?
So he was murdered.
The man was a pig,
but it's a decision
we should've all made together.
You are not in command here.
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.
What are you talking about?
They could kill us all.
Everything that happens
on this ship affects us all.
The Master-At-Arms
is already suspicious.
We could still go back.
There will be no going back.
Before we sailed,
I dispatched a letter
to Admiral Padorin,
in which I announced
our intention...
to defect.
In the name of God, why?
When he reached the New World,
Cortez burned his ships.
As a result, his men
were well motivated.
You have signed
our death warrants.
Padorin will send
the entire fleet.
Jesus, they'll find us.
They'll find us and...
No one's going to find us.
That's enough, Yuri.
You had to do it, huh?
You couldn't just
turn the submarine over
to the Americans.
You had to make
a political statement.
Or was it something
deeper, Captain...
something that made you
unable to slip away?
Was it ego, Captain?
We each have
our reasons, Victor.
My own began
the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship...
a ship which had but one use.
And as for the rest,
well, those are things
that I alone
must carry the burden for.
Anatoli,
you're afraid of our fleet.
Well, you should be.
Personally, I give us
one chance in three.
More tea, anyone?
No?
Then you may report
back to your posts.
You heard the Captain.
Dismissed.
Captain.
Captain, I would never
disagree with you
in front of the men,
you know that.
But in this case,
Victor is right.
It would've been better
if you had not informed Moscow.
Oh, Vasily.
Moscow is not the worry,
nor the whole Soviet Navy.
I know their tactics.
I have the advantage.
No.
The worry is the Americans.
If we meet the right sort,
this will work.
We get some buckaroo...
Some turbulence,
eh, Commander?
You don't like flying, huh?
Oh, this is nothing!
You should've been with us
five, six months ago!
Oh! You talk about puke!
We ran into a hailstorm
over the sea of Japan, right?
Everybody's retching
their guts out!
The pilot shot his lunch
all over the windshield,
and I barf on the radio!
Knocked it out completely,
and it wasn't
that lightweight stuff either!
It was that chunky,
industrial-weight puke!
You want a bite?
Jack, next time
you get a bright idea,
just put it in a memo.
Sir.
That'll be all, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
That hawkeye
from Weymouth Trap?
Four wire.
Caught a gust over the fantail.
Well, not bad, considering.
The gentleman
is here to see you.
The gentleman?
What the hell
you talking about, Charlie?
I apologize
for the uniform, sir.
This is Admiral Greer's idea
of a low profile.
You work for Jim Greer?
That's right, sir.
Then I imagine you'll tell me
what all the hubbub's about.
Captain, you got a minute?
Jonesy's got something
I think you ought to see.
Martinez, get yourself
a cup of coffee.
Send me up some tea.
Aye, Captain.
Messenger,
get the captain a cup of tea.
Captain.
Sir, the moment
that sub went silent
and I thought I
heard some singing,
I heard something
in the background real faint.
After all those subs took off,
I caught it again
and got it on tape.
I washed it through the computer
and was able to
isolate this sound.
When I asked the computer
to identify it,
what I got was
magma displacement.
You see, sir,
the SAPS software
was originally written
to look for seismic events.
I think when it gets confused,
it kind of runs home to Mama.
I'm not following you,
Jonesy.
Sir, I'm sorry.
Listen to it
at 10 times speed.
Now, that's got to
be manmade, Captain.
All right.
The first contact was at 09:15,
and the bearing was 2-6-9.
At 09:30, it was here.
I came back to it at 11:00
and 11:15, here and here.
Remember the dispatch we got
about Russian sub skippers
running the Reykjanes Ridge
at high speeds
because they had
hyper-accurate surveys
of the underwater canyons?
The front door to those canyons
was a formation
called Thor's Twins.
Yeah?
Look at that.
Right into Red Route One.
Captain.
You may think I'm crazy,
but I'll bet that
magma displacement
was actually some
new Russian sub,
and it's headed
for the lceland coast.
Have I got this straight,
Jonesy?
A $40 million computer tells you
you're chasing an earthquake,
but you don't believe it,
and you come up
with this on your own?
Yes, sir.
Including all the navigation math?
Sir, I've got all the...
Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.
Tommy, I want you
to plot us a speed course
for the bottom end
of Red Route One.
We'll never find him
in those canyons.
First take us
to periscope depth.
This we got to phone in.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Hang on, Jonesy.
If I can get you close enough,
can you track this sucker?
Yes, sir.
Now that I know
what to listen for,
I'll bag him.
Carry on.
Yes, sir.
That's the craziest notion
I've ever heard...
a serving line officer?
An entire ballistic
missile submarine?
They can't all want to defect.
Even if it's only the officers,
it's extremely
difficult to believe.
What's his plan?
His plan?
Russians don't take a dump, son,
without a plan.
Senior captains don't start
something this dangerous
without having thought
the matter through.
What's he going to do,
sail into New York, pop the hatch,
and say here I am?
It might be just
that simple, yes.
Things may appear simple
in the cubicle at CIA,
but in the middle
of the Atlantic
with Soviet warships
bearing down on us,
they get more complex.
Smoke?
No, thank you.
And I don't think your notion
of a few days inspection's
going to wash either.
In order to be of any value,
you'd have to tear it apart.
The metallurgy would
take a couple of months.
Then we'd have to keep it.
What will you do with the crew?
Ones that don't defect will go back
and say we got the boat.
Or do you plan
to eliminate them?
We're not at war, sir.
So you have to get them
off the boat in such a way
that they think we don't have it,
and they'll report that
we don't have it to their bosses.
Otherwise, this whole business
is just academic, right?
Yes, sir.
I think I see your point.
When's the last time you slept?
A while.
The chief outside
will fix you up.
Thank you, sir.
Captain.
It'll be dawn
in a couple of hours.
We'll be in the CIC.
Things are liable to get
a little dicey around here.
Yes, sir.
You think he's crazy?
Certifiable.
No matter what
his credentials,
I don't care for him
wearing the uniform.
Did you see that ring
on his finger?
The academy, class of '72.
A marine.
You're kidding.
How did you...
Greer told me.
Summer of his third year,
he went down
in a chopper accident.
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.
That kid spent
10 months in traction
and another year
learning to walk again.
He did his fourth year
from the hospital.
It's up to you, Charlie,
but you might consider
cutting the kid a little slack.
Ah, Russians are
going to find that sub
before we get near it anyway.
Passing Thor's Twins, sir.
Very good.
Passing the twins now,
Captain.
Very good.
You may commence your run.
Call me at the first turning.
Aye, Captain.
Mr. Kamarov.
You may commence your run now.
Aye, sir.
First leg on my mark,

Stop pissing, Yuri.
Give me a stopwatch and a map,
and I'll fly the Alps
in a plane with no windows.
If the map is accurate enough.
We're in the lane
and approaching first turn.
Come left to course 1-9-5.
In 30 seconds,
decrease depth to 200 meters.
Maintain speed.
Very good, Navigator.
Captain, we're approaching
the first turn.
25 seconds to course 1-9-5.
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.
Aye, Captain.
Navigator, recompute
for 26 knots.
Turn on my mark.

Mark.
Diving control,

Mr. Kamarov?
Next leg, Captain,
come right
to course 2-4-0 now at...
8 minutes and 40 seconds.
Very good.
Maintain course and speed.
Too fast, Vasily.
Too fast.
Those charts are
laid out precisely...
so many knots
for so many seconds.
And this thing
handles like a pig.
Watch your bearing,
Mr. Slavin.
15 seconds to turn, Captain.
Should we decrease speed?
Negative.
Prepare to come right.
Aye, sir.

Move it!
We're in the lane.
Next leg 34 minutes
to the Neptune Massif.
Course 2-4-0.
What happened?
The cryogenic plant!
The magnets aren't cooling.
Temperature in
the caterpillar
is 15 degrees above red line
and rising.
It's going to melt.
Kill it! Shut it down!
Captain?
What happened?
The cryogenic plant failed.
Reactor damage?
There was a power spike,
but the reactor
scrammed automatically.
Was there any
radiation leakage?
I don't know yet!
How long will it take to fix?
I got to find
what's wrong first.
Could be the liquid helium
or the superconductors.
Captain, we will have to stop
until we can repair
the caterpillar unit.
Negative.
We'll run on normal propulsion.
Captain,
we will not be silent.
Make revolutions for 20 knots
and engage the propellers.
Aye, Captain.
Commence engine start-up.
He'll get us all killed.
The captain knows
what he's doing.
Doctor.
Naval activities?
I have no knowledge of this.
But then,
I never was a sailor.
Mr. Ambassador,
you have nearly
100 vessels operating
in the North Atlantic
right now.
Your aircraft have dropped
enough sonar buoys
that a man could walk
from Greenland to Scotland
without getting his feet wet.
Shall we dispense with the bull?
You make your point
as delicately as ever,
Mr. Pelt, but...
And what looks like an exercise
could be a prelude to war.
How can we tell the difference?
Prudence demands that we
deploy ships to observe yours.
Your government should consider
that having
your ships and ours,
your aircraft and ours,
in such proximity
is inherently dangerous.
Wars have begun that way,
Mr. Ambassador.
We have lost
one of our submarines.
Lost it?
We fear she may be down, and...
this is most embarrassing, but...
several of the officers
are sons of...
high party officials.
One is even the son
of a Central Committee member.
I cannot say which.
You're telling me this is
a massive rescue operation?
That is correct.
I'm terribly sorry.
How can we help?
I'm not sure that...
Perhaps a joint rescue mission?
That is very gracious of you, sir.
I'll pass your offer on.
But at this time,
I think we're doing everything
that can be done.
Captain?
Our strategy depends
on your answer.
The entire fleet
will know where we are.
Captain, Sonar.
We've been overflown
by a multi-engine turboprop.
Put it on audio.
Short transients,
close aboard.
Water entry of small objects.
Sonar buoys.
Battle stations.
Battle stations!
Battle stations!
Battle stations!
How long to Neptune Massif?
How long?
4 minutes, 10 seconds.
Should we bottom the boat?
No. Too late now.
We've run out of time.
Countermeasures.
Prepare to launch missiles.
Aye, sir.
Aircraft on computer guidance.
Request permission to launch.
You are authorized
to launch the weapon.
Weapon is away.
High speed screw!
Torpedo in the water!
Stand by.
Torpedo is active.
Torpedo has acquired.
Launch countermeasures.
Launch countermeasures.
Aye, sir.
We're in the lane.
How long till
the turn at Massif?
2 minutes, 9 seconds.
We have no room to maneuver
in these canyons.
Shut up.
Torpedo has reached
countermeasures.
Torpedo has lost contact.
Massif approaching.
Torpedo has reacquired.
Torpedo has reacquired
and is homing.
Give me the count.
Turn at Massif 40 degrees starboard
in 30 seconds.
Time to torpedo impact?
Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.
Increase to flank.
Full ahead flank.
Full ahead flank.
Full ahead flank, aye.
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.

We're out of the lane!
You're relieved.

Captain, they're
really shooting at us!
Pull yourself together!
Boy! Easy, boy.
If they were really
shooting at us,
we'd be dead by now.
Give me some line.
I found out what happened
to the caterpillar.
The buffer circuit
has been torn out.
It was only a matter of time
before an overload
shut it down.
What are you saying?
Whoever did this knew how
to cripple the caterpillar
in a way not easy to find.
Captain,
we have a saboteur on board.
It can't be any of the officers.
They had plenty of time
before we embarked.
Must be a crew member.
Go to Putin's cabin.
Check his files
for information on the crew.
We may have to put them off
before we planned.
The average Russky, son,
don't take a dump
without a plan.
Wait a minute.
We don't have to get
the crew off the sub.
He would have had to do that.
We just have to figure out
what he's going to do.
How is he going
to get them off the sub?
They'd have to want to get off.
How do you get a crew
to want to get off a submarine?
How do you get them
to want to get off
a nuclear sub...
I know how he's going
to evacuate the sub.
Not now, Jack.
Yankee One star base,
say again status.
Declare an emergency.
Declare an emergency.
Yankee One,
requesting vectors.
Vector 2-7-0 speed is buster.
Yankee One's
losing hydraulic pressure.
Say again, Yankee One.
Bear Foxtrot got too close
to the group.
One of the F-14s crowded him,
and they bumped.
He's losing hydraulic fluid.
They're trying to get him
back aboard now.
Busy morning.
Hmm.
Russian attack subs are now stationed
off every East Coast port.
We're up here.
The New Jersey
is moving up the coast
while the Russians,
aside from over 100 bear foxtrots,
have a row of subs
and several surface groups.
That's a lot of firepower.
For a rescue team, yes.
There's something else strange.
They're using sonar as if
they're looking for something,
but nobody's listening.
What do you mean?
At their speed they could
run over my daughter's stereo
and not hear it.
They're not searching
for Ramius.
They're driving him.
Driving him where?
The hounds to the hunters.
Your sub captain's going
to make it to America.
He's going to die
within sight of it.
His wing man kept requesting
permission to fire.
Somebody messes up, we'll be
in the biggest naval battle
since the Jutland.
Jesus!
Water's too cold to eject him.
Air boss will try
to bring him aboard.
Sir, what's this sub
off by herself?
Bart Mancuso's boat.
He's going to the bottom
of Red Route One.
He's had intermittent contact
with a magma displacement.
He's got this...
Magma displacement?
Is that like a seismic anomaly?
I suppose so. Why?
Is there a way you could
get me onboard the Dallas?
What for?
I think Mancuso's found
the Red October.
He hasn't found anything, Jack.
He's just waiting.
Sir, this silent propulsion system
could easily be mistaken
for something...
The only way to get you
that far north
is to use a chopper turned
into a flying gas can.
Admiral, Yankee One
is on final.
Rescue personnel
are in place.
Pick up your left wing.
You're drifting left.
Power, power!
Wave off, wave off!
Eject, eject, eject!
Fire, fire!
Fire on the flight deck!
This business will
get out of control,
and we'll be lucky
to live through it.
Fire on the flight deck.
All hands lend assistance.
The bird's loaded down
with enough fuel to get you there,
but Dallas may not be there.
We're trying to reach her.
If she's gone deep,
it's dodgey.
If you have to ditch...
If you have to ditch,
don't think about anything
but the survival gear.
At this water's temperature,
you'll have about four minutes.
I'll try to remember that.
Next time, Jack,
write a goddamn memo.
Diving Officer,
make your depth 6-5-0 feet.
Make my depth 6-5-0 feet.
Sonar, Conn preceding
below the thermal layer.
The captain's sacked out?
Yeah.
Auxiliaries
proceed 5,000 pounds.
What about him?
He won't leave.
Conn. Sonar, hold.
No contacts on bearing 2-9-5.
You know...
I seen me a mermaid once.
I've even seen me
a shark eat a octopus,
but I ain't never seen
no phantom Russian submarine.
We're emerging
from the route, Captain.
I've ordered a routine clearing
of the baffles.
We'll be making the first turn
in a few minutes.
The caterpillar is operational
and appears to be
running normally.
The crew know about the saboteur.
They are afraid.
Well, that could be useful
when the time comes.
You know, we could make
the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.
Half of them would freeze
before they were rescued.
No, it's Massachusetts
or Maine...
in 48 hours.
Two days.
Do you think they will
let me live in Montana?
I would think they'll
let you live wherever you want.
Good.
Then I will live in Montana,
and I will marry
a round American woman
and raise rabbits,
and she will cook them for me,
and I will have a pickup truck...
or a...
possibly even
a recreational vehicle
and drive from state to state.
Do they let you do that?
Yes.
No papers?
No papers.
State to state.
All right.
Commence your turn.
Well, then...
in winter I will live
in Arizona.
Actually, I think
I will need two wives.
Oh, at least.
Possible aspect change
on target.
Sonar, Conn. Aye.
Concur possible target zig
based on bearing rate.
Conn! Sonar! Crazy lvan!
All stop! Quick quiet!
All stop, aye.
Engine's all stopped.
What's going on, Jonesy?
Russian captains
sometimes turn suddenly
to see if anyone's behind them.
We call it Crazy lvan.
The only thing
you can do is go dead,
shut everything down, and make
like a hole in the water.
So what's the catch?
Catch is a boat this big
doesn't exactly stop on a dime.
If we're too close,
we'll drift right
into the back of him.
What about you?
What do you look forward to?
I...
I have no such appetites.
Now, let's see if he can hear us.
Well, there must be something.
What is it?
Ahh.
I miss...
the peace of fishing
Iike when I was a boy.
40 years I have been at sea.
A war at sea.
A war with no battles.
No monuments.
Only casualties.
I widowed her
the day I married her.
My wife died while I
was at sea, you know.
Post guards
in the engineering spaces.
If he can get
to the caterpillar,
he can get to somewhere
more vital.
Where is he, Jonesy?
Conn, Sonar.
Target is now coming out
of our starboard baffles.
My read is that he
is returning to base course.
Concur. He's returning
to course 2-1-0.
He went right around us.
We'll give him
another 30 seconds,
then secure from silent running.
Captain?
Here's what we got
on the E.L.F.
Thanks.
Aye, sir.
What is it?
You're not going
to believe this.
Commander,
we are approaching no return.
Dallas apparently
hasn't gotten the message.
We have to turn back
for the carrier.
Give it a couple more minutes.
Negative. Fuel status
says we turn around now.
Fuel status?
You got a reserve, don't you?
I've got a 10-minute reserve,
but I'm not allowed to invade that
except during war.
If you don't get me
on that submarine,
you might have it.
You got 10 minutes
worth of fuel.
We stay here 10 more minutes.
Yo! Mount up!
Yo, I got a submarine
at around 3:00.
About 2 miles.
OK, Tony, hook him up.
I'll be lowering you down
to the submarine now.
Give me eight minutes.
Let's hope this thing
runs on fumes.
Very well.
Surface the ship.
Whoever this guy is,
he's in for one hell of a ride.
OK, Commander,
go ahead and sit down.
You ever do this before?
Once. On a calm day...
off Hawaii.
The pilot will have
a difficult time keeping steady.
Don't take chances
getting grounded.
Keep that rod in front of you.
In air like this,
the rotors will put out
enough static electricity
to light up Chicago.
That's why I joined the Navy.
A diver's in the escape trunk
in case this guy
goes in the drink.
Someone must have
a burr up his ass
to go for a stunt like this.
All right. Ready! Ready!
Get your hook up!
Commander, if I got
to bring you back up,
I'm going to shake the wire.
I'll give you a thumbs up,
like this.
Remember to cross your arms.
Got it? OK. Out you go.
Passenger's out the door.
Passenger's halfway down,
drifting forward.
Start forward.
All right, Tommy.
Get the hook on his cable.
On his cable. Now, watch it.
Don't touch him.
OK, here he comes.
Oh, no!
It would be easier
without that bloody crosswind.
Where is he?
I can't see him.
Don't touch him!
Jack! Jack! Jack!
This is never going to work.
OK, reel him back in.
Tony, what's going on back...
What happened? Dallas,
have you got a swimmer standing?
Emergency stop! Man overboard!
Port side!
Send out the diver!
Very well, Dallas.
We are history.
Get the doc down here!
I'll be in the escape trunk.
Down ladder! Down ladder!
Make a hole!
Watch his head.
Watch his head.
How do you do, Captain?
It's a pleasure to be aboard.
I have to talk to the President.
Of course.
May I inquire as to the subject?
It seems that the initial reports
that one of our submarines
was missing
were not completely accurate.
The submarine in question
is commanded
by Captain Marko Ramius.
Apparently, he has suffered
a kind of mental
nervous breakdown.
Just before he sailed,
he posted a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin
in which he announced
his intention to...
to fire his missiles
on the United States.
Why didn't you tell me this
the last time we met?
In my position
I'm sometimes compromised
by the fact Moscow doesn't
always tell me everything.
So one of your submarine captains
has gone insane?
What do you want from us?
You offered your assistance.
That was a rescue mission.
Now you want us to help you
hunt him down and kill him.
I have been instructed
to ask your President
for precisely that.
Find him?
We already found him.
We had to break off
to pick you up.
Captain, excuse me.
Coffee?
Thank you.
Cigarette?
Don't smoke.
Assuming we can find him,
just what exactly
am I supposed to do about it?
Captain, radio.
We're receiving
flash traffic
on the V.L.F.
emergency circuit.
Very well. Bring it down.
Well, Mr. Ryan?
Chief, excuse us for a second.
Leonard,
come on out of there.
The sub we're after
is called the Red October.
She's under the command
of a man named Ramius.
Now, there's the possibility
that he and a good
portion of his crew
are attempting to defect.
Defect?
Excuse me.
You say the boat's
called the Red October?
That's right.
Skipper's Ramius?
Right.
It seems the circumstances
have changed somewhat,
Mr. Ryan.
Get this man some dry clothes.
I'll be in the conn.
Aye, aye, sir.
"National Command Authority
informed Soviet typhoon class
submarine Red October
is potential renegade
and threatens
independent missile launch.
You are authorized
to use any necessary force
to prevent said submarine
from approaching
the coast
of the United States".
Left 10 degrees rudder

Left 10 degrees rudder

Make turns for 14 knots.
Chief of the watch,
rig for red.
Time Quartermasters
and Navigator
on the deck in the conn.
What's going on?
Battle stations
are manned and ready.
Very well.
Captain, I have to talk to you.
Not now.
Make your depth 1,200 feet,
20 degrees down angle.
Diving officer, make your depth
1,200 feet, 20 degree down.
Full dive

Full dive on stern planes.
20 degree down.
Passing 450 feet,
going to 1,200.
500.
600.
700.
Did you get a good fix?
Yes, Captain.
Very well.
At ordered depth,
1,200 feet.
Sonar, Conn.
You got him, yet, Jonesy?
Very faint, sir. Hold on.
Yes, sir. Contact typhoon seven
on bearing 2-5-0.
Right where he's supposed to be.
Any sign he's alerted
to our presence?
No. Operating as before.
Come left 2-6-5.
Bring us up
behind him quietly, Tommy.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Diving officer,
make your depth 500 feet.
Captain, please listen to me.
Two minutes, that's all.
Plot, time to intercept his track.
Four minutes, Captain.
Very well, Mr. Ryan.
Two minutes.
It makes perfect sense.
Look at the situation...
Ramius intends to defect.
The Russians know this,
which is why they've
tried to sink him,
but they haven't been able to.
I have a firing solution.
The Russians
will stop at nothing
to prevent Ramius
from defecting.
They've invented
this story that he's crazy
because they need us
to sink him
before he can contact us.
Weapons control,
I want full safeties.
I don't want this fish
coming back.
Full safety.
Captain, I know this man.
Has he made any Crazy lvans?
What difference does that make?
- The next one will be to starboard.
- 'Cause his last was to port?
Because he goes to starboard
in the bottom half of the hour.
Flood tubes one and two.
Warm up the weapons.
Find a way to establish contact
without violating orders.
He wants to defect!
Mr. Thompson,
call Chief Watson
to the conn with his sidearm.
Conn, Sonar.
Signal to noise ratio's dropping.
Possible aspect change
in target.
Possible target zig
based on bearing rate.
Conn, Sonar. Crazy lvan!
Captain.
Captain, he's turning.
Which way is he turning?
To the starboard, sir.
Give the man a chance.
All back full.
Captain, say again.
I said all back full!
Back full. Aye, sir.
Engines back full.
We're cavitating.
He can hear us!
Conn, aye. All stop.
All stop, aye.
All right.
We just unzipped our fly.
Mr. Thompson,
open the outer doors.
Firing point procedures.
Now, if that bastard
so much as twitches,
I'm going to blow him
right to Mars.
All stop rudder amid ship.
What's going on?
Can you identify the contact?
American Los Angeles-class
attack submarine
bearing 0-1-5...
Captain,
sharp metallic transients.
He may be trying to open
his torpedo tube doors.
Outer doors are open
on tubes one and two.
We're ready to shoot.
Very well.
My orders are specific, Mr. Ryan.
He's opened his outer doors.
He's preparing to fire.
Flood tubes three and four
and plot a solution.
Captain, flood tubes three and four.
Plot solution.
Shall I open
the torpedo tube door, sir?
Captain,
shall I open outer doors?
No.
Lock the firing solution
into the computer.
Do not open the doors.
Aye, Captain.
Lock solution into computer.
Conn, Sonar.
Target's flooded his tubes.
Has he opened his outer doors?
Negative, Captain.
He's just sitting there.
Hold on.
Hull popping.
Target's coming shallow.
What's that mean?
That means he's
a very cool customer,
your Russian.
He knows we're here
and ready to shoot.
He's not provoking us.
He's heading to periscope depth
to see what's on the surface.
His course is 2-0-7, due west.
Bring us alongside him.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Sonar, Conn.
Report all contacts.
Conn, Sonar.
My only contact is typhoon seven,
bearing 1-9-5.
Very well. Fire control,
range to target?
Range is 300 yards.
Make your depth 65 feet.
Diving Officer,
make your depth 65 feet.
He wants to go up
and take a peek.
We'll play along.
Going to 45.
Going to 45.
Weapons status?
Weapons are on.
Tubes three and four
are flooded.
Outer doors are closed.
25 meters.
Depth 25 meters.
Mark this bearing.
You wanted to talk
to him, Mr. Ryan.
There he is.
What do you want to say?
Is he the only one looking?
Probably.
We'll have to chance that.
"U.S. told you intend
missile launch". Break.
"Do not approach U.S. coast
or you will be attacked".
Break.
"If intention is other...
will you discuss option?"
Break.
Can he acknowledge
with a single ping?
Yeah, he can.
The question is, will he?
Verify our range to target.
One ping only.
Aye, captain.
I'll be damned.
Now what?
All right.
"If defection..."
You plot course toward..."
The chart.
I need a chart.
No. No.
OK. Where the hell are we?
Someplace deep.
Someplace deep.
OK.
OK!
Send them this!
You out of your mind?
Just send it.
Tell me one thing.
How did you know he was
going to go to starboard?
I didn't.
I had a 50/50 chance.
I needed a break. Sorry.
That's all right, Mr. Ryan.
My Morse is so rusty
I may be sending dimensions
on Playmate of the Month.
Reverify our range to target.
One ping only.
Captain, I... I... I just...
Give me a ping, Vasily.
One ping only, please.
Aye, Captain.
What the hell is this about?
The Russians
want us to sink her.
We might have to do that.
We must give this American
a wide berth.
Let us turn south.
Mr. Kamarov.
Plot a new course due south.
Yes, sir.
New course 1-8-0.
It's the reactor!
Shut down the reactor!
Seal the ventilation system!
The ventilation controls
have failed!
Everybody out.
Clear the compartment!
Out!
Ventilation system,
shut it down now.
They don't respond.
The controls don't respond!
Bypass it.
Seal it manually!
Move! Shut it off.
Melekhin, say again.
Suffered a leak
in the primary coolant tube,
so shut down the reactor,
but the ventilation circuits
have been disabled.
The coolant appears
highly contaminated.
I knew there was damage
when the caterpillar went down.
Radiation alarms activating
in all compartments.
Engineering
is heavily contaminated,
and radiation's moving forward.
Get to periscope depth.
Ventilate with outside air.
Aye, Captain.
Periscope depth!
Prepare to ventilate!
Ventilating won't do anything.
We've got to get them off.
What's the battery condition?
Four hours.
Six, if we're cautious.
Engage battery system.
We've got a level one
radiation leak.
Every surface of this
ship's contaminated.
We've got to get the men off.
Sir, we have been sabotaged!
Who said anything
about sabotage?
Captain!
Sir, I'm afraid
the doctor is right.
Very well.
Surface. We'll evacuate
the men to the deck.
Aye, Captain.
Surface the ship!
Prepare to muster all personnel
to escape hatches.
Break out the rafts.
Lash them to the deck.
We'll use them as shelters
until the fleet arrives.
Make sure the count
is accurate, Doctor.
We must get the entire crew out.
Yes, sir.
Master-At-Arms reports rafts secure
and evacuation proceeding.
Very good.
We'll rotate through the conn.
No officer will spend
more than 20 minutes below deck.
Will that be satisfactory?
Completely, Captain.
Surface contact!
2-7-0.
6 miles and closing fast.
It's a warship.
What? Here?
Can you identify it?
It's a frigate,
U.S., probably,
Perry class.
He's signaling.
"Red October.
Red October.
Halt and stay where you are.
Do not attempt to submerge,
or you will be fired upon".
Captain, I think
he means to board us.
You will go with the crew.
The officers and I will submerge beneath you
and scuttle the ship.
You'll receive the order of Lenin
for this, Captain.
We're going to cast off.
The captain's going
to scuttle the ship.
He's going down, sir.
Put a shot across his bow.
Come right at 1-8-0.
Seahawk One,
this is Bravo Command.
She's ready.
Seahawk One,
release on my command.
Drop now...now...now.
Range to target...
900 yards.
800 yards.
700 yards.
600 yards.
500 yards.
400 yards.
300 yards.
The torpedo is detonated.
Now, understand, Commander,
that torpedo
did not self-destruct.
You heard it hit the hull.
And I...was never here.
Contact Dallas.
Give them the go.
Advise Dallas.
Get the DSRV moving.
Dallas, this is Rueben James.
There are about
two million things
that can still go wrong
with this stunt.
Central lntelligence Agency.
Now, there's
a contradiction in terms.
How's the coffee, Ryan?
Dallas, this is the Mystic.
Request clearance for launch.
Mystic, Dallas.
You're cleared for launch.
Hatch is secured.
Life support, normal.
Prelaunch checks complete.
We're ready to launch.
Aye.
Flood the skirt.
Flood the skirt. Aye.
Skirt's filled and equalized.
Soft seal.
Ready to lift off.
OK. Let's do it.
We're off.
Thrusting port.
600 yards and closing.
Steer right to course 0-7-5.
400.
200 yards.
100 yards.
Hit the lights.
Jesus, that's a big sucker.
OK, we're in position.
You can open the hatch.
Hold it a second.
Jonesy.
Mr. Ryan.
He's defecting.
And he can't change his mind?
He's not going
to change his mind.
You willing
to bet your life on that?
Uh, sir, could you
hand me that hammer?
Yeah.
Americans.
What's so funny?
Well, the captain
seems to think
you're some sort of cowboy.
It is.
I doubt you'd remember,
but we met once
at the consulate in Leningrad.
Along with your wife.
I'm very sorry.
What gives you the right
to fire on my ship?
Your signal said nothing
of a torpedo.
Ryan.
It was necessary to maintain
the illusion for your crew.
My crew are being rescued, yes?
As we speak.
You sent the signal.
That's correct, sir.
Then how did you know
our reactor accident was false?
Well, that was a guess,
but it seemed logical.
Very well.
I present you
the ballistic missile
submarine Red October.
My officers and I
request asylum...
in the United States
of America.
It's a pleasure, sir.
Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.
Torpedo. The Americans
are shooting at us again.
The pitch is too high.
The torpedo's Russian.
Where the hell
did it come from?
Conn, Sonar.
New contact. Sierra 4-1.
Alfa class Soviet submarine.
Why don't I have a detonation?
The weapon enabled
on the far side of the target.
It passed Red October
before arming.
Fire again with the right settings
and reload both tubes.
Get me power.
Get that damn thing off my boat.
It's off.
I think somebody
shot a torpedo at us.
No shit, Buckwheat.
Get out of here.
Where am I...
Borodin, fire control.
Uh, Ryan.
Sit here.
I'm not a naval officer.
I'm with the CIA.
CIA?
I'm not an agent.
I just write books
for the CIA.
Whatever. Sit down.
And do exactly what I tell you.
DSRVs away.
There's a Russian alfa
8,000 yards to starboard.
I think it's the Konovalov.
Increase the flank.
Increase the flank.
How?
That knob. Turn right full.
All ahead flank.
Right full rudder.
He's shooting again, sir.
Go to battle stations.
Battle stations.
Chief of Watch,
man battle stations.
Torpedo in the water.
Bearing 3-1-5.
Make range 7,000 yards.
Steer right 3-1-5.
That's heading
into the torpedo.
Steady,
bearing still 3-1-5.
Estimated range...
6,000 yards.
Still 3-1-5.
Steer right
till this reads 3-1-5.
No, that's wrong.
Ryan, don't turn that goddamn wheel.
3-1-5.
You're heading straight
into that torpedo.
Yes.
Doing what?
He's turned
into the torpedo's path.
What?
Red October's turned directly
into the torpedo's path, sir.
Mother of God.
Torpedo steady,
bearing 3-1-5.
Range...5,000 yards.
Melekhin, more speed.
Estimate range 3,000 yards.
Closing awfully fast.
What's he trying to do,
kill himself?
We have a firing solution
on the Russian alfa.
Can we shoot back?
They didn't shoot at us.
I can't attack a Soviet submarine
without authorization.
Torpedo bearing steady at 3-1-5.
Best range... 900 yards.
Torpedo impact...
20 seconds.
What books?
Pardon me.
What books did you write?
I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey
called The Fighting Sailor,
about naval combat tactics.
I know this book.
Torpedo impact...
Your conclusions
were all wrong, Ryan.
10 seconds.
Halsey acted stupidly.
9...
8...
7...
6...
5...
4...
3...
2...
Torpedo impact...
now.
I'll be damned.
What happened?
Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.
By turning into the torpedo,
the captain closed the distance
before it could arm itself.
So that's it?
Not quite.
Right now, Captain Tupolev
is removing the safety
features on all his weapons.
He won't make
the same mistake twice.
Vasily, have you
plotted a solution yet?
Aye, Captain.
It's a little rough, but I...
Gunfire?
That's what it sounded like, sir.
Won't change his mind?
It's one of the crew.
Well, whoever he is,
he's having second thoughts.
I would like
to have seen Montana.
Captain, he stumbled forward
into the missile bay.
There's a silo hatch warning...
port side, number 20.
He can't launch a missile.
No, but he can blow one up.
Captain, take the conn.
Fire control's blasted to hell.
Then get behind him
and stay there.
Captain, wait.
You may need this, sir.
Thank you.
Don't just stand there, Ryan.
Go with him!
You, you speak English?
Yes, sir.
Get your butt over here.
Captain, torpedo
broke off on impact.
Set the safety ranges
for zero.
I cannot go any faster.
We must get him
before he gets to
the ignition circuits.
What happens if he gets
to that ignition circuitry?
He can incinerate the ship.
Is that door
the only way out of here?
Yes.
Don't let him get past you.
Hey, Ryan.
Be careful
what you shoot at, hmm?
Most things in here
don't react too well
to bullets.
Right.
I have to be careful
what I shoot at?
Safety ranges set to zero.
Sonar, give me the bearing
for Red October.
She's positioned behind us.
Right full rudder!
I'll shake the man loose.
He's going deep.
30 degree down angle!
All the countermeasures
were over there, right?
Very well.
Admiral,
the alfa's too quick.
It's only a matter of time.
"Ryan, some things in here
don't react well to bullets".
Yeah.
Like me.
I don't react well to bullets.
Aah!
Where's he now?
Close, sir.
900 meters, directly ahead.
Got him.
Match bearings and fire.
We are too close!
Don't argue.
Launch the weapon.
The torpedoes are armed
in the tubes! You cannot...
Do it now!
Another torpedo. It went active
the moment it was launched.
Left full rudder.
Ease off on your bow planes.
I think he's got us.
Way to go, Dallas!
Torpedo is in acquisition.
Range 500 yards and closing.
You've done it, Mr. Thompson!
I hope this works.
Chief, put us on the roof.
Countermeasure station,
on my mark. 5, 4...
1. Release countermeasures.
Emergency blow!
Full rise. Fair water plane.
600 feet.
550...
500 feet.
450...
Come on, big D. Fly.
That torpedo's still active.
It's searching
for another target.
A goddamn cook!
How close is that alfa, Jonesy?
1,000 yards, going to port.
Reverse your turn.
We're turning straight at him.
Torpedo's still on our tail.
The hard part
about playing chicken
is knowing when to flinch.
Collision in 400 yards.
350...
300...
Captain!
Right full rudder,
30 degree down angle.
Aye, sir.
This one's going to be close.
Torpedo dead ahead!
You arrogant ass.
You've killed us.
We have ascertained
the Red October's
final position, but...
given the depth of the water
and the fact that the wreckage
spreads across a wide area,
it'll be some time before
anything's recovered.
However, your people
are interviewing the crew now
and making arrangements
for their return.
This has been a terrible tragedy,
Mr. Ambassador.
And I can only stress
that if you'd come to us earlier
it might have been avoided.
I appreciate your candor
in the matter.
And I yours, Andrei.
Perhaps in the future
technology will allow
a more thorough investigation
of the wreckage.
Perhaps.
There is another matter...
one that I'm reluctant to...
Please.
One of our submarines...
an alfa...
was last reported in the area
of the Grand Banks.
We have not heard
from her for some time.
Andrei.
You've lost another submarine?
All this way to hide
a submarine in a river.
We're 100 miles
from the nearest naval base,
the last place
that satellites will ever look.
I grew up around here.
My grandfather taught me to fish
off that island right over there.
There's one question
you haven't asked me yet.
Why?
Well, I figured you would tell me
when you were ready.
Now, there are
those who believe
we should attack
the United States first,
settle everything
in one moment.
Red October was built
for that purpose.
When the dust settles
from this,
there's going to be
hell to pay in Moscow.
Well, perhaps.
Maybe something good
will come from it.
A little revolution,
now and then,
is a healthy thing,
don't you think?
Do you still like to fish, Ryan?
Mm-hmm.
There's a river,
not unlike this one,
near Vilnius,
where my grandfather
taught me to fish.
"And the sea will grant
each man new hope
as sleep brings dreams of home".
Christopher Columbus.
Welcome to the New World, sir.
Everything all right, sir?
