Can we start?
Hold it, hold it. Exhale.
Breathe.
Let's go.
Go ahead, I hear you.
And now? Can you hear me?
Excuse me.
Could you lower the music?
I'm on the phone, I...
Go ahead, I hear you.
It's not me, it's the taxi radio.
I told him.
Where are you?
In front of the theater?
So how was it? Did Dad like it?
Well, I hear you.
I hear you fine.
I hear you, I hear you.
Could you lower the music, please?
No, just lower it.
Almost there. Where are you?
Oh, yeah, I see you.
This is it, we're here.
They're coming.
They're right there. They're coming.
Sir? They're coming.
All right, I heard you.
Well, you didn't answer me, so...
I said it twice and...
Enough. If you're not happy,
get out and find another cab!
"They're coming."
When? What year?
I'm not waiting all night.
I'm losing money!
- What took so long?
- I couldn't hear you.
Wait, there's one more.
- Where's Dad?
- Right here.
- Where were you?
- We've been waiting 15 minutes.
Everybody in? Can we go now?
The door!
- What?
- Door's not closed.
You talking to me?
Watch your tone of voice.
- My tone of...
- Oh, no. I'm telling you.
Don't take that tone with me!
Or anyone. Ever heard of courtesy?
- Rue de Pavois.
- I know.
I'm telling you again.
All right?
Take a right. Too much traffic.
Yes, sir.
Yes, they simplified your book.
But it's a movie, they can't...
- It got to me, it really did.
- Where's Vincent?
When she sees the orchestra
with another singer...
What did you think?
I was in shock. I thought,
"No way I wrote this idiotic crap."
I must be an idiot. It got to me.
- I wish I'd seen it.
- Should have ditched your thing.
- My thing...
- There's Vincent.
You told me too late.
I can't ditch 10 people.
It's hard to agree on a time.
I couldn't do that to them.
- You lost weight?
- Not a bit.
See that? Some people go right in.
What is that?
Are there two types of guests?
You mean some get
special treatment? No.
- Oh, good.
- You can't make the actors wait.
Look! It's him. That's Cassard.
At the entrance there.
Oh, he's gone. Did you see?
- Rare, seeing you entranced.
- Entranced?
You're suddenly wired. It's funny.
Stop.
I like a writer.
I see him go by, I'm happy.
- Was I entranced?
- Not really.
He's a good writer and publisher.
Okay, but I need to see the invite.
Ask Mr. Cassard. He's my father.
He just went in. Go find him.
I can't leave my station.
Step aside. You're in the way.
You can't stay here.
You're in the way.
Karine, it's Lolita.
They won't let me in.
Go somewhere else with that.
I'm starved.
Does the invite say there's food?
There's food. Who has the invites?
Edith.
What do you mean?
I gave them to you at the theater.
I don't have them. I'm sure I don't.
- Sylvia?
- No, I'm certain I don't. I'll look, but...
Sorry, Edith,
but you never gave them to me.
I can see myself doing it.
Felix? Pierre?
Let's go, forget it.
We can't leave now.
They have a list.
- We'll just explain.
- Not me. Let's go.
Stay if you want,
but I will not beg them.
There are gorgeous actresses inside.
Let's at least try.
He's really leaving?
Wait for us!
Are you all right?
Elevate his legs. It's a malaise.
Your boyfriend's blind drunk.
Boyfriend? I don't even know him.
He's freezing. Better cover him.
Ask if he vomited.
- Knock, knock.
- Lolita!
Where were you?
I turn my head one second,
you're gone!
I thought you were behind us.
Is she with you?
So many pretty girls.
Amazing.
- Go dance with Karine?
- No.
This tonight's mood?
We thought you were already inside.
How could we guess
you stopped to make a call?
Here.
What's this?
"Daddy Schubert"?
The tape you asked me for.
I asked for?
No, give it to me.
Remind me what it is.
You wanted to hear me sing,
there's my tape.
Oh, fine. Give it to me.
- Sorry, you didn't say a tape.
- Of course I did.
How are you?
- Come dance.
- I don't feel like it.
I have a headache.
Shit, my jacket!
Such a disappointing film.
Cassard must've freaked.
Nothing left of his book.
That beautiful moment.
She's backstage...
...and she sees a singer
who's rehearsing.
It's totally lost.
Cassard doesn't care.
Don't bet on it.
Wouldn't you,
if they made your book...
...into an idiotic tearjerker?
That would mean
at least it got some interest.
I'm no longer a writer.
I took Nicolas to his mom's.
She gave me a form.
I'm ashamed.
Next time, under "profession,"
I'll put "kept man."
"Writer" goes under "hobbies."
You know that's ridiculous.
No, I'm not being ridiculous.
I'm being lucid.
Stop it.
You always do this dark,
defeatist number.
Maybe if you'd written 15 books.
You wrote two. So come on.
And those two books exist.
You got great reviews.
One. One good review.
No, not just one.
Anyway, lots of people
like your writing.
Now a third book. Things look good.
You think it stinks.
You think it stinks.
I think it stinks?
Did I ever say that?
I said the tone was lighter.
You twist things around.
I think it stinks...
Want me to reiterate my admiration?
Yes.
Nice, talking to a panda
now and then.
The Paris book, they told Felix no.
They like the pictures,
but they backed off.
It's too costly.
Really?
- I thought they liked it.
- Yeah, but no.
And that's why
you're all gloom-and-doom?
I thought it was happening.
And we'd get a little money.
All that.
It's no big deal.
It'll happen later.
I'm holding Felix back.
Any known writer, he'd have his book.
Make a fist
and put it in your mouth.
Keep the throat open like that.
Take your hand out.
And sing in the mask. In front.
All right?
Let's go.
You're listening to yourself.
Let the sound go.
Music keeps moving.
Don't be stuck on yourself.
Not a chance.
Use the consonants,
don't avoid them.
Enough for today.
Anyway, you'll work on it
with Mrs. Kiehl.
- Fine.
- It's still not perfect.
We'll try it Friday.
And we have rehearsal Tuesday.
With my group. Tuesday.
- Tuesday?
- Yes, 8:00.
You said you could.
I said that?
I said I could?
Well, see you Tuesday, then. Fine.
All right.
Jean-Baptiste? The Verdi?
- From the cantabile.
- Fine.
She looks at me like I'm God.
Who knows why.
It gets me uptight.
I could kick myself.
Something I don't want to do...
Instead of saying,
"No, sorry, I don't have time"...
...just being adult about it...
...I say yes and wind up
with a 50-hour workweek.
Should I take the tomatoes out?
I don't know, look.
I'm looking, I'm staring.
But I still don't know.
Yes, go ahead.
Who are they? What do they want?
An amateur group. Very sweet.
It's for a concert in some church.
Whatever. I have to just
tell them that I can't.
Okay. Nothing else to do?
Why am I so winded?
Do you get winded like this?
I'm all winded here.
I hate those stairs.
I was never winded before.
Incredible. Paris is empty.
An hour trip took me five minutes.
How are you?
Something to drink?
Water.
Want some good news?
Hi, Edith.
Now...
Not counting your fan,
Tricaud, in Rouen...
- Bricaud.
- Right, him.
Between the calls and the letters...
...we're up to eight booksellers.
I said eight booksellers
who really, really loved your book!
You're sweet.
Sweet? What does that mean?
"Really, really loved it."
Same as the last two books.
No, I'm sorry.
They are
more and more enthusiastic.
When they call me, I hear it.
Believe me, Pierre...
...I smell something.
That's tomato sauce.
Let me get that.
Go ahead, make fun.
- No, I mean...
- "No, I mean"...
They just asked me. It's brand-new.
Yeah, it's flattering. Exactly.
On European literature.
"Is there a European literature?"
I never thought about it.
You neither? Not surprising.
I'm running late.
Call me back, Vincent?
No, I'm just floundering.
I had two good lines. Then I realized
I wrote them in another book.
Okay, Vincent. See you tomorrow.
- Let's go, Karine.
- I've been waiting.
So long, princess.
- It's for you.
- Me? How sweet.
Very pretty.
What's that big monster?
- Daddy.
- Daddy? What a horror.
Daddy has a tiny body,
a big, square head...
...and a red beak? Strange.
- It's very pretty, honey.
Of course. But Daddy is ugly.
- See you later.
- No sweets. No ice cream, nothing.
She ate. She doesn't need
any more food.
No. Even if she has a fit.
- Just ice cream.
- All right, I got it.
I'm hungry.
You ate. You can wait.
I'm going to die.
Hi, Mathieu. Lolita.
I wanted to tell you.
About Friday, sure, why not?
I had this thing, but I canceled.
So I'm free.
Well, a thing. It wasn't...
Anyway, yes. So see you.
I am such an idiot.
Yes, that's me.
Oh, right. Yeah.
Well, frankly,
I'm a little surprised.
I thought that jacket was lost.
Because I don't usually drink.
Not much, anyway.
I knew someone put the jacket on me.
But I didn't know who.
Then I looked in the pocket
and found the photo.
That's actually how I met you.
What you did is important for me.
What did I do?
Taking care of me, a stranger.
You collapsed at my feet.
I guess I had to...
No, you didn't have to.
My boyfriend's coming.
We're going to a movie.
I see. I'll go now.
No, that's okay.
You're an actress?
Actress is a big word.
I've done some theater,
some vocal training. All that.
- And you?
- Journalist. Well, I just graduated.
Let's go. It's time.
Zelie, Lolita.
- Coming?
- No.
Come if you want.
I missed that party.
How's your dad?
He's fine.
Excuse me.
We haven't set the next date.
- What?
- Next Tuesday, the group.
No, I can't next Tuesday.
And we have to talk about that.
Not now, I'm in a hurry.
But we have to talk about it.
It's not that much to lose.
Don't overdramatize.
It's not like you're a model.
Accept yourself.
Stand up.
Step back, please.
Take off the jacket so I can see.
I'm enormous. I'm still overweight
by at least 10 pounds.
I won't try this on.
I'll look like a hooker.
How do you know? This store
has great stuff, and you won't try.
Nothing in my size.
At least try that one on.
I'm sure you'll look great.
You won't try it?
I just hope I fit in the booth.
I'm sick of getting suckered.
He says, "Let's do this."
I think, "He's being nice. What's this?"
But he doesn't care.
And neither do I.
- Your father adores you.
- Yeah, right.
Anyway, I like
going shopping with you.
I often want to ask you to do stuff.
Like go work out with me.
- I'm afraid you'll brush me off.
- Ridiculous!
Maybe. But it's hard for me...
- No, the top. Ridiculous.
- Let's see.
Sure, if you stand like that.
Very pretty. Really.
It looks great on you.
If I had your bust, believe me...
Really. Buy it.
Do it for me.
Okay, I'll buy it,
but I won't wear it.
And the black sweater.
- You have black sweaters.
- Not like this one.
Funny. I thought today
I'd have nothing. But then...
Happens a lot. I arrive depressed,
I don't feel like singing.
And afterward I feel great.
Singing is euphoric.
I love your ring.
Thanks.
I wanted to see you
about the group's rehearsals.
Excuse me. My father asked me
to give you his number.
Your husband should call him.
There.
Because he loved his book.
All right, I'll tell him.
Etienne Cassard.
Etienne Cassard?
The writer?
He's your father?
I didn't know that.
I really admire him.
Funny. I ran into him at a party.
He was with...
Well, I saw him go by.
With a young woman.
His daughter, I thought.
- His wife.
- His wife?
Well, doesn't matter.
He's your father.
So, what were you saying
about the rehearsals?
Oh, yes.
What I wanted to say is...
...it's good. You have nice voices.
It's an interesting project.
But it requires a lot of work.
It's a lot of work.
So, what are you saying?
We should see you more often?
That's right, yeah.
Among other things.
Well, see you tomorrow.
Let's stop. Stop, please.
Go get some air.
Don't forget your scores next time.
Let me hear the basses.
From the top?
From where?
Where the sopranos come in.
Once again.
- Was that it?
- Yes.
Give them a nod.
Watch Christophe.
Let's see that article.
- You've read it?
- Three, four times.
Which is the one I like?
Twelve.
It's not 12, Felix!
Hang on. I'm coming.
Guess who called me last night.
The fat guy, the publisher we met.
Right. Pierre, listen.
You'll get dozens of offers.
It will never stop.
You will. It's only natural.
Happens every time. People
smell success, they come running.
- Take your time.
- Felix is...
Pierre, it's an exceptional review.
Exceptional!
Full page in Le Monde.
Here, "An author is born,
intriguing...
...crafty, surprising digressions.
At times poetic..."
Please! "At times poetic
in understated grief...
...at times philosophical
in reclaimed serenity...
...and heart-wrenching control."
- Good mood?
- I'm glad, aren't you?
Sure.
To both of you. To you.
- To us.
- To your success.
No big deal.
I just thought maybe you could...
Five hundred.
Forget it, I'll work it out.
Yeah, okay.
How are you?
Sorry. I got problems.
What kind?
I did this job...
...three months ago.
I can't get paid. Rent's late.
Just material problems.
You had long hair.
Your name is Rachid?
Should we walk?
I use Sébastien because...
...it makes life easier.
Fine. Do whatever you want.
- So? Were you singing?
- No, sight-reading class.
- I could lend you money.
- No.
- You'll pay it back.
- No, really.
What's 500 euros to my dad?
- Just like that?
- He's generous, for that stuff.
Giving money is pretty simple.
We've seen so many bad places,
I was losing hope...
...but that one...
- Yes, true.
And there's so much room.
It's a lot of money to borrow.
It's like paying rent.
A little more.
- Slow down.
- I hate being late.
We're early. We're here.
It's at the corner.
- You're funny with Cassard.
- Not again!
It's got nothing to do with him.
You know I hate being late.
And that new hairdo.
What period is that?
Leave me for him. I can say
I brought flowers when you met.
Yes, it's a very good interpretation.
Must be 1500 square feet.
- No, 1250.
- It's great.
- What's that?
- Felix's pictures.
Of Paris?
- Can I see?
- Not with those hands.
Finish eating. You'll look later.
So Horwitz called you back?
Yeah. I'll see him next week.
I'm not counting on it.
But it looks good.
I'm not counting on it.
I'm crossing my arms,
as Edith would say.
Excuse me, have we met?
Maybe. No, I...
- You saw him on TV.
- Stop.
Yes, maybe it was. When?
- The other day, but...
- Maybe. What program?
A literary thing.
Don't touch.
Excuse me.
So you want to come along
to meet Horwitz?
Sure, why not? When is it?
- Friday.
- No. I'm in the country, at Cassard's.
You see him often.
Often? Once in a while.
Can I see?
He wants to sign you?
No, not at all.
- Dessert?
- We have raspberry tart.
Try it. Very good. Two slices.
Coming right up. Two coffees?
Right.
Pretty girl, huh?
- How are you?
- Fine.
Hello, Etienne.
Is it true you're going to merge...
...or get bought out by Tessier?
Rumors. You know each other?
Yes, I've told him
how much I liked his book.
You learned to read?
You have a way with people.
When I like them.
See you soon, I hope.
Let me get this off my chest.
You know I'm a publisher too.
I know how much
you like your publisher.
And I understand that.
But I'm telling you,
if one day you change your mind...
...don't go to that pulp vendor.
Come to me.
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm having lunch, Lolita.
And I'm talking to someone.
I leave it on for emergencies.
What do you want?
I don't have to explain.
What is it you want?
Don't call me back later.
Tell me now.
Bring whoever you want.
What cassette?
Okay, right.
The cassette. I remember.
Not yet.
I'll bring it to the country
and listen there.
No daughters?
Why is she angry?
She's angry in general.
She's anger on wheels.
At the whole world, especially me.
- How is it with her mom?
- Her mother's nuts.
Takes yoga in Martinique.
That's all I know.
We split when Lolita was 3.
Why are you so mad at your dad?
I'm not. I'd just like to kill him.
And your mom?
You only talk about him.
I do not!
You talk about him a lot.
My mother's in Antilles.
What should I say?
- Why are you yelling?
- "I talk only about my dad."
It's no big deal.
- Expecting a call?
- Yeah, Mathieu.
I don't get it.
He's your boyfriend?
Yes. Well, no.
We had this thing, and then...
I mean, we still do. It's complicated.
- It's not... You understand?
- Yeah.
Well... No, not really.
It's six months away.
- Other Frenchmen?
- Not that they mentioned.
Is it sponsored by Europe
or by the Italians?
Karine, could you get the batteries?
The little ones, for...
Who sponsors it?
- Oh, shit!
- What?
What is it?
- I forgot the wine.
- What wine?
- The two bottles I wanted to bring.
- What wine?
The Margaux that
what's-his-name gave me.
Great wine. I wanted to drink it.
The ones he gave you?
Do I have to repeat every sentence?
What? Repeat what?
You never stop. All day,
"What? What wine? What?"
When, just now?
I'm surprised.
He was really sensitive.
Really sensitive. I'm surprised.
It's for later.
- What's she want now?
- Nothing.
Doctor hurt her feelings.
I sent her there.
I have an idea. The girls keep going.
You and I get the wine.
No, not two more hours in a car.
Forget the wine.
Well, then I'll go alone.
I don't mind.
Give me your house keys.
No. We'll drink the local sludge
that makes you go blind.
Give me the keys. Come on.
I want to taste that wine.
Etienne. Really.
- Sure?
- Hey, look at me.
All right.
See you later.
What is it?
Don't get all upset.
Music is hard.
It is for everyone.
That's not why.
Something to do with rehearsals?
I didn't get that.
I'm sorry, I can't come
with you to the country.
Oh, no big deal.
I mean, if that's all it is.
I was supposed to go with Mathieu.
Your boyfriend?
Yeah, well... Yes.
He left a message
to say he couldn't go.
I don't want to go alone.
Beautiful here.
It might rain all weekend.
It's clearing up. I see blue.
- Blue where?
- There.
Back there.
Let's not start that.
What do you mean?
We're sharing a room, but...
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be.
I understand very well.
No problem.
See? It's clearing up.
What are you doing?
- What?
- I'm stopping. I'm done driving.
Why? I'll shut up.
I promise I'll shut up.
- Are you sure?
- I'll never drive with you again.
I'll die alone, or with friends.
Incredible, how it
cleared up so suddenly.
That phone call with Edith.
An hour! It was unreal.
She just can't admit she's wrong.
Know many who can?
No, but she acted all hurt.
Role reversal.
I'm persecuting her.
I can see
you don't feel like agreeing.
No, you're wrong.
I don't get this map.
Oh, I see.
I got it memorized.
Etienne explained it again before.
We get off before Courcy.
I got it, I got it.
Does Fabien want tea?
We're going for a walk.
And his name is Sébastien.
I had the "ien" right.
Vincent, want some tea?
- You're Mathieu, right?
- No, Sébastien.
- Not too hard to find?
- No.
- I missed the exit.
- You went to Courcy?
To Courcy.
Mathieu?
Yes, I hear you.
You're coming tonight?
Sure, I was planning
on going.
Sure. I don't know,
when are you going?
A party, not far from here.
Well, seven miles.
I'm going. I feel like going.
- Come if you want.
- No, thanks. I'm leaving.
Why?
- Is there a train tonight?
- No.
I'll leave tomorrow.
- Hey, look...
- What?
Nothing.
Honestly.
Forget I'm her father.
No bull. What do you think?
- She has a nice voice.
- No bull?
No, I mean it. It's hard to say...
Because, I mean...
...she's all invested,
like she can be a singer.
Why not?
If she can stick it out...
No way.
She tried.
She's all over the place.
She wanted to be an actress.
She's not very realistic.
Karine, turn the volume down
on the kid.
- And you?
- Me?
Never wanted a career?
She'd rather take care of me.
That's his fantasy.
No. For me, it's...
So peaceful in the country.
- She wants ice cream. I'm against it.
- So don't have any.
She's pitching a fit.
Tell her it's not ice cream time.
When is ice cream time?
In case she asks.
- I'll go.
- We have to do the shopping!
Where's Vincent and Sébastien?
Sébastien?
There's cyanide in the bathroom.
Why do you say that?
Just to cut the tension.
I'm not tense.
What was I looking for?
My daughter.
Sébastien?
Sébastien?
I like to dance.
I didn't feel like it.
Move those bags, I can't get by.
What's keeping Vincent?
There's a bakery right nearby.
Not the good bakery...
...with the raspberry tart...
Move the damn bags already!
Watch it.
Why did you kick them?
I said, move them, sonny.
"Sonny"?
What? Got a problem, sonny?
No, hey. Forget it.
Tell me if you got a problem.
What's taking him so long?
We'll have dinner late.
I feel bad.
- You were on the road all day.
- I didn't drive much.
And I'll see the church.
Aurèle sings well, huh?
Exceptional voice.
And she's pretty.
Sébastien didn't want to come?
No, because Mathieu's there.
Oh, Mathieu's there.
It's a misunderstanding.
- With Mathieu?
- No, with Sébastien.
I can't get him out of my head.
Sébastien?
I'm not sure. You try.
Let it go.
Sing for the back of the room.
Take your space, Lolita. Enjoy it.
But that's a good spot.
Good acoustics.
So when? August 20th?
No, the 17th. If all goes well.
Why?
The mayor has to sign off.
My dad said he'd call. Six months ago.
It's a big pain for him.
I'm a big pain for him.
Why do you say that?
For my father?
I didn't get that. He seems
very concerned about you.
Very concerned?
Why not call the mayor yourself?
I don't know him.
My father does.
It would take him 10 seconds.
Should we go?
That's a pretty top.
It is? Not ridiculous?
No. Why?
Funny. Your father
asked me the same question.
But he hasn't heard you.
Your voice is so beautiful.
It's not "so beautiful."
Beautiful voices are a dime a dozen.
I'm going to go.
Stay a minute. Have a drink?
No, thanks.
- Hey.
- You scared me.
- Just got here?
- Yes.
Sylvia, Mathieu.
Nice to meet you.
Before I forget...
...could you give this to your father?
The Spanish article about him.
Want to dance?
No, I'm going.
No? Come on, dance.
No, thanks. Really.
Sure, sure...
Sure, sure...
...but not just that.
There's the money,
but also the promotion...
- The prizes.
- The prizes.
Stay with her, you have no chance.
Which really sucks, by the way...
...but it's true.
No one stays with a first publisher,
except for...
You'll lose your queen.
What did I say?
Can't you shut up?
If you watch, watch in silence.
Don't make comments!
- I'll lose my queen.
- Yeah, looks like it.
What have I done?
- I need to buy a new brain.
- One hasty move.
I'm losing thousands of neurons.
I'm going downhill.
Rematch?
I can't stand losing at chess.
I'm going downhill.
I can't write one line.
When I write, it's garbage.
You always say that. Who won?
He did. He won.
He can't stand losing at chess.
I just told him.
Poor sweetums.
Getting consoled is
even more humiliating. Stop.
I'm just carrying out my orders.
- Nothing you need?
- No, thanks.
Get on that horse and ride.
You're not in charge.
You'll pay for this mistake.
I got no time.
Ride away.
I always find Westerns boring.
Same thing, over and over.
Over and over.
Tastycat, a matter of respect.
First thing, he gives me the article.
That doesn't mean he...
From the start,
he wanted to meet my father.
I didn't interest him.
Mathieu and the others,
they're all the same.
They find out
I'm so-and-so's daughter...
...suddenly they find me
very interesting.
It's disgusting.
They're all like that.
Well, not you, of course.
- Your move.
- I know.
I know only too well.
Well? Not even a "good night"?
- How are you?
- Fine. Got lost?
No.
My big girl.
Stop, you're hurting me.
Wouldn't hurt if it was muscle.
- Good night.
- Good night.
So? Did you dance
on the tables?
No, jumped up and down.
- Sounds great.
- It was uneven.
You stayed very late.
No. Not that late.
I had a drink with Lolita.
It was a nice crowd.
Great game.
Vincent won't deny it.
Who's winning?
He snores admiringly once in a while.
Very encouraging.
- Who's winning?
- He's been excited for an hour...
Could you pass me the chocolates?
I have to concentrate.
With the trouble I'm in...
I asked the housekeeper to make us
tarragon rabbit tomorrow.
All right?
She makes a mean rabbit.
Well, fine with me. But...
- Rabbit?
- Sure, fine.
- Don't like it?
- Yes, I do.
These are the curtains I meant.
What does Vincent do?
Do you know?
Sidekick.
Besides that?
He's his assistant, I guess.
You like rabbit now?
Not my favorite, but I can eat it.
Under torture?
No, you're wrong.
I have it occasionally.
Doesn't disgust you?
No. As long as
I don't think about rats.
Sébastien?
Sébastien?
Are you sleeping?
You hear that?
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Could you look?
That. What is it?
I'm not up on animal noises.
A mouse, a rat, giant roaches...
Stop! Don't say that.
You asked me what it was.
I have no idea.
You're not nice.
I'm the one who's not nice?
Nothing there.
Underneath...
Nothing. It's in the floorboards.
But what is it?
- It's Bambi.
- Bambi?
Don't want animal names?
Okay, it's Bambi.
In the floor. Can I go back to bed?
You're not crying over me?
It's everything.
I'm a zero.
We're all zeros.
Not as much as me.
If you say so.
I'm going to bed.
Lolita.
Please. I'm going to bed.
So you've done nothing?
- Nothing much. Stringer work.
- Oh, yeah? Where?
- A journal that...
- What kind?
Dead animal!
- I want some!
- I'll give you some.
- She ate.
- So let her taste it. Big deal.
I told her no.
I said yes. A little piece.
Just a little, okay?
- A tiny piece.
- That's how weight disorders start.
It'll skew her whole diet?
One tiny piece of meat at 1:45 p.m.?
We have to talk about this crap
for an hour?
By the way,
there's a museum five miles away.
You have to see it.
Great stuff. I'll show you the way.
- What's that?
- It's not pork.
- Pork is not a problem.
- Rabbit.
That's a problem.
I don't care for that.
I'll fix you something.
I'll just have salad.
I don't understand the aversion.
- I'll get some...
- No. Anyway, I'm leaving.
What do you think?
Delicious. Really good.
No, really.
The sauce is...
Antonia's secret.
You know where it's good too?
At La Roseraie.
No, there's no comparison.
No, really.
Not that it's the same.
In restaurants...
...it's always dry.
But it's good. Ever tried it there?
I don't like rabbit.
I mean, not in restaurants.
- Known Etienne long?
- Twenty-five years.
It's a long story.
I saw him again 14 years ago.
That long?
Were you in publishing?
I was in terrorism.
Well, I was in a bad way.
If not for him,
I don't know where I'd be.
So you're leaving?
Why? You have
something to say?
No, nothing.
If you want to go, go.
True, Etienne doesn't do much.
Karine accepts it, fine.
It gets on my nerves.
Women do everything.
Men sit around, as usual.
- No?
- Yeah.
- You don't care.
- I do...
...but it's not all I got
from this weekend.
Me neither.
A 75,000 advance on the next book.
- Francs?
- Euros.
Our currency
for the last three years.
- Five hundred thousand francs.
- What Etienne's offering?
You could have a terrace there.
- It's only 3 feet wide.
- A little terrace.
Little table, two little chairs,
two little bowls.
It's up to you now, guy.
- Up to me?
- Our book.
They want the copy. Did you start?
A little. It's coming.
I see how I have to do it.
- Want a drink?
- Coming.
You said I was carrying you?
Without you, this doesn't happen.
- No way.
- Believe me.
- Dad.
- Hello, Mr. Cassard.
She's at your table.
- You okay?
- No.
Lots of annoying details.
I'm sick of these Italians.
They keep changing dates on me.
- Now a second Frenchmen.
- Who?
I don't know.
I don't even think they know.
I'm in bad shape. Not one good line
in six months. Only crap.
Not a line in six months?
Louder. They missed it
in the kitchen.
What am I going to have?
- Listen to my tape?
- Not yet.
Your friend looking for work?
What's his name? Fabien? No.
- Sébastien.
- Sébastien. Right.
That keeps happening.
I'm going steadily downhill.
- You never recall names.
- Really?
That's reassuring.
It's true, I never could...
The money was for your friend?
He couldn't get paid...
I don't care. Does he want work?
- He's starting a paper with friends.
- Right.
Tell him to call Michelet.
Say I sent him. He needs a guy.
Tell him to call me, I'll explain.
Having lunch with my daughter.
Fine. Great.
One of life's daily pleasures.
She's sweet, smart...
She just turned 5.
Then he made 15 phone calls.
It was like I wasn't there.
Won't hear from me for a while.
Let him try to invite me.
You wanted to see me about him?
Just tell me.
- No.
- Oh, okay.
I didn't mean to bother you.
You said you wanted to talk to me.
Yes, I do.
Fine. If it's the money,
I'll pay you back.
Screw the money.
I'll pay it back anyway.
So?
Nothing.
No, Sébastien.
Stop.
I wanted to tell you.
Sorry. I'm going to have to talk
about my dad again.
He said if you want work
to call him.
He has a friend with an opening.
I should call him?
Yeah. If you want to.
That's nice of him.
That's what you wanted to say?
It's my dad. I won't answer.
I'm fat, huh?
I don't like skinny girls.
I just want to listen.
Karine left.
I yell, but...
I don't mean any harm.
I get carried away. It just happens.
Pass me a Kleenex.
It's like my face.
My face, she says it terrifies her.
It's my face. It's just like that.
It's not conscious.
The only woman who loved me.
No, you can't say that.
There was Mom.
She never loved me.
She told me so.
As if she had to.
And I didn't love her either.
I got off at Saint-Michel.
I walked 15 minutes.
You didn't wait for me?
Only an hour and a quarter.
- An hour and a quarter?
- Yes.
We said 2:00.
No, Edith, not 2. We said 1.
I have a class at 3, so I know.
Sorry, but I'm certain.
You always are, but you're wrong!
Court is in session.
Then you do that. You're the victim,
others persecute you.
It's a real pain.
You're getting this angry
over a misunderstanding?
You won't recognize it!
You can't just say,
"Sorry, I made a mistake."
I'm not sorry
for mistakes I never made.
What is it with you two?
Pierre's the same. He's all over me.
If you do a lousy job,
he's right to tell you.
A lousy job?
No. Nothing, thanks.
Merging with Edith
would've been easier for me.
Not very festive.
Funerals never are.
Excuse me, Mr. Tessier
wants to meet you.
Sure, fine.
Mr. Tessier would like to meet you.
Fine. Here I am.
I shouldn't have come.
These people bore me.
Fluttering around their new master.
I'm happy you're now on our team.
I have much esteem for you.
You don't know me.
When you read Chamber Music,
all that humanity and conscience...
...you feel you know the writer.
You believe that?
Anyway, in case you were worried...
...your freedom won't be questioned.
Just the opposite.
Your independence is what I bought.
How reassuring.
Excuse me.
Yes, honey.
Yes, of course. Of course.
- Karine?
- No one. So he'd leave.
You stuck it to him.
Those guys don't get it.
And Chamber Music
was my worst book anyway.
That's excessive.
Always the easy one that sells.
Just like with yours.
Who's that girl?
I know her. The gorgeous one
with that moron, François Galland.
No idea. She is pretty.
I thought it would come back,
that I could write.
Not a chance.
- What good is misery?
- You see her tomorrow?
I see the kid at my in-laws'.
Karine might not come. Let's go.
Hi. I just wanted to say
I'd love to have you on the show.
I won't bother asking you.
Not anymore. I still hope, though.
Anyway, I thought it was
a brilliant novel.
Bowled me over.
An important book...
- I'm going.
- Wait up.
Excuse me, I have to go.
Hi, I wanted to tell you
your novel was fantastic.
I read it in one sitting.
Oh, this is Stella.
Pleasure. Thanks.
Yes, I'm here.
How are you?
And you? Was it fun?
It wasn't very interesting.
I hate those things. All phonies.
Etienne's still down. Depressed.
Can't get over her.
- Got some work done?
- Some, yeah.
You know who I met there...
...who really, really surprised me?
Witty, smart, receptive.
The opposite of what I thought.
François Galland.
Galland from TV?
- Receptive?
- I'm telling you.
I expected a total asshole. No.
He really, really surprised me.
Right. Felix called.
I left him a message.
I have to read them over...
...but I'm almost done.
Of course.
- What?
- She was at the party.
I knew I'd seen her before.
Tastycat, a matter of respect.
Did she surprise you?
Witty, receptive?
No, it's just funny.
I'm all bent out of shape
about this thing with Edith.
I have to give Etienne an answer.
I said I was tempted...
...but I have to decide.
What should I do?
I don't know. Don't ask me.
It's up to you.
I'm staying out of it.
Now, the recipe.
The recipe is...
You like pie?
I mean, lots of pies?
Or lots of pies in one pie?
Lots of pies.
There.
Strawberry pie.
I wanted ice cream.
There it is.
Oh, there it is. Yes.
Want a North Pole marshmallow?
African marshmallow with boar.
Really good.
- Caramel.
- That's enough.
Come on.
- It's good.
- I don't feel good. Ate too much.
Now I have to sleep at least an hour.
Then have a strawberry.
You scared me.
Grandpa got you something.
I just got here.
African marshmallow?
So, what do you want?
Lolita will never like me.
With you it's the same. I don't count.
You say you love me...
...and I believe you.
But at times I feel like a chair.
A chair?
You don't see me.
Whatever I say is nothing.
You make fun of me.
- Make fun...
- Yes, in front of everyone.
You don't see it.
- I look like an idiot.
- I make jokes.
With everyone.
Some don't take it so hard.
Cowards. They don't dare tell you.
They laugh, they don't care.
They want to please you.
It's my father...
I can't force you. It takes work.
You must rehearse. To be ready.
He's not well.
I can't leave him.
I can feel he needs me.
Sébastien is there.
He seems nice.
Since my dad said he'd help him.
I wondered what he saw in me.
Same old drill.
I have to focus on the concert.
My big girl!
Call me back, Vincent?
- How are you?
- Fine.
I'm glad to see you.
You mad at me?
Silly. You could've sat for Louna.
Took us hours to find someone.
Professor Pélissier,
we'll follow your cause.
In bookstores,
Pierre Miller's third novel...
Thank you, girls.
- Look At Me, Saturnale Press.
The novel of the summer.
Stay tuned for the news.
See you next week.
Good night!
Yeah.
Pierre was good.
Not really at home there.
When he talked about his book...
...that was okay. Well, it was...
But telling millions of people
he sometimes practices sodomy...
...may not be necessary.
I hate those programs.
Yeah, but it's no big deal.
No, no big deal.
Nothing is.
Did he sign with Cassard?
- He's going to. Didn't he tell you?
- No.
I don't see him anymore.
We play phone tag.
He's very busy, apparently.
At times, I think he's avoiding me.
Avoiding you? What?
Paranoia?
He is busy with stupid stuff
like that, for one thing.
He finished the copy.
That's what his last message said.
Have you seen Edith?
She told me about your argument.
How idiotic.
It is idiotic, of course.
Still, it's gone too far.
You can't talk to her anymore.
She goes off,
even when she's wrong.
It's tiresome.
And I don't know.
She's become a bitter person.
Bitter?
Well, no, but...
She's changed.
What?
You know how it is.
She says you two have changed.
You can't be piano enough.
Did you see my Handel score?
I have to go on in a half-hour.
Why am I low?
Why is it me who's low?
- Looks great.
- Think so?
It's going to be okay.
Hey, where's Lolita?
Do I look like a Russian doll?
- Russian dolls are pretty.
- I'll change.
Stop. You look beautiful. Really.
I'm scared. This isn't normal.
Your father got me
that appointment.
Nothing comes out.
You'll be fine.
Don't worry.
So I thanked him and...
I don't give a shit
about you and my father.
- You don't?
- I don't want to hear it.
I have stage fright.
I won't go if this keeps up.
They'll sing,
and I'll just kill myself here.
- I ran into Edith.
- Yeah? Did you talk to her?
No, she didn't see me.
I wanted to call to her.
I felt lousy.
About what? Quit it.
We've talked this to death.
Do you like being mortified?
No. I saw her and I felt weird,
only natural.
It's always the same.
Edith, François Galland, the parties.
Etienne is too this or that,
every time.
You always make me feel guilty.
I make you feel guilty?
No idea. I tinkered with this thing
on my breakup, but...
She came back.
Which doesn't inspire me.
Ask them who it is already.
Peace and quiet doesn't help?
I never wrote a line here.
No signal.
How does yours get a signal?
- I don't know.
- Did they tell you?
- You'll be surprised.
- Yeah?
- Say it.
- Pierre.
- Me?
- You're kidding.
They want a new-generation writer.
Did you tell them...?
I told them nothing.
How pretty she is!
You know this dress.
Yes, but I love it.
Your daughter can't sleep.
Over there. There are seats.
Mr. Cassard,
we've saved you seats up front.
We'll stay in the back.
It's better for her.
The mayor told me to...
Nice of him. But we'll stay here.
On the left!
Thanks again.
I was in such a state.
It comes in waves, you know?
I can't keep up with my thoughts.
Who knows how it happens.
It's miraculous when it comes back.
What a beautiful girl.
Oh, yes.
She has a very pretty voice.
Great, about Rome and Pierre.
Yes, so great I'm not going.
- Not going?
- No.
I'll say I have no time anymore.
They'll manage.
Find another new-generation writer.
- Wait, they said...
- I don't want to go.
Thanks, Etienne.
For what?
The spread. All this.
Very good, as usual.
- So proud of your daughter?
- Oh, yes.
She sang well.
They all did.
You did fantastic work.
Her voice was hesitant at first,
but little by little...
She was really moving.
Yes. She was moving.
- He didn't like it?
- Sure, loved it.
Good, right? Did you like Lolita?
Yes. I was a little tense.
Me too. I was scared.
But she surprised me.
Who knew her voice was so good?
I want to tell you.
I've been wanting to tell you this.
That time...
...with the waiter,
it wasn't worth fighting.
What waiter?
In the café,
when he kicked the bags.
Oh, I had forgotten.
I didn't want to fight him because...
You were right.
People who fight scare me.
I'd forgotten all about it.
Well, I remember.
You can't fight every jerk...
Exactly.
Drive safely.
You okay?
It was good, really.
The Monteverdi was near your best.
You're moving on-stage.
Well, at least I didn't faint.
I can't believe it.
What?
Nothing.
This is a tape
from my singing class...
...I gave my father six months ago.
He never opened it.
He heard you sing live. Even better.
He hasn't said a word to me.
Bye, Lolita!
You don't need help?
I forgot my bag.
- Bye, Sylvia.
- Bye, Aurèle.
She is gorgeous.
Fabulous. She'll go far.
What's her name?
Aurèle. Want her number?
Hey, come on, Lolita.
With guys like you, she'll go far.
I said she's pretty.
Are you nuts? I can't say that?
What should we do, wear blindfolds?
She sings!
Who cares how she looks?
- I understand her.
- No, you don't!
You gain an ounce, you want to die!
I'm not the crazy one!
You really calmed her down.
I'm kidding.
Everyone's crying. And over what?
Because I said she'd go far?
Thanks to her looks.
You musicians above all that?
We're not above anything.
You see what happened.
It was her night. You said nothing.
Because he didn't hear her.
Didn't hear her?
He left three minutes in,
came back to applaud.
- You didn't hear Lolita?
- Sure, a little.
At the beginning.
It was fine.
It was fine. I had to step out.
I needed a pen.
Am I going to get yelled at?
Mind your business.
This lady's teaching me manners.
It's true, she is a guilt pusher!
He has problems with Lolita.
He does. Right?
That idiot with her pity.
- Karine?
- Yes.
She was just trying to...
Fuck her pity! She can't know.
She has no idea.
They throw my weight in my face!
I can't get into a club.
You know that? They won't let me in.
Me neither.
- Then don't rub it in.
- I don't rub it in.
She tried to be nice.
You were unfair.
Sure, you agree with them now.
What a coincidence.
What does that mean?
No, you're right.
Don't bother with me.
You got what you want
from my father.
Stop pretending.
What?
You know what I mean.
I didn't say anything
because it was no use.
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like?
You're leaving now?
- Middle of the night?
- I can't look at that guy again.
Sylvia, he was upset is all.
His daughter's always at him.
She's a pain in the ass.
That how you see it?
He didn't kill anyone.
By the way...
Felix's book, did you write the copy?
No, huh?
The DA again.
No, I haven't written a single word!
I can't keep my mind on it.
I have a book to write, a contract!
I have obligations.
Lots of stuff to do. I'm swamped!
I'm not leaving, so you know.
I got that.
You're just going to drive away?
I'll leave you in peace.
You all alone?
Not talking to me?
Because I left the concert?
You left the concert?
Sébastien didn't tell you?
- No.
- I thought he did.
But I saw the beginning.
Everyone says you were great.
Don't bother.
- Why?
- Don't force yourself.
I'm not.
You're my big girl.
- Where's Sébastien?
- No idea.
I don't know how you see him,
but he seems a little weird.
I get him an interview
he could never dream of getting.
He's all happy, "Thanks a lot."
Then he shows up today
and says he's not interested.
He wants to try his stupid thing
with his friends.
- He's not very polite...
- I didn't know that!
Are you crazy? They're sleeping.
Tell Karine I'm sorry,
that I know she's nice.
You won't forget?
Are you cold?
You're a pain.
O celestial art
How oft, in hours of gloom
When smothered by
Life's ferocious embrace
Thou didst give birth
To comfort in my heart
Delivering me
Into a better world
