Great young coach.
Took Abilene Christian

I remember.
Then he got the Ohio State job.
Right. And then
he lost the Ohio State job
for losing it
on one of his players.
He bounced around
internationally for a while.
Now he's an assistant coach
for the Iowa Stallions.
Now, he didn't like
what the head coach drew up,
and, look,
he goes all WWE on his boss.
- Uh...
- No. Uh-oh.
- Want me to turn it off?
- (crowd booing over TV)
Mm, no. Turn it up.
After all that nonsense,
there's still six seconds
of basketball to be played,
and this is where
we want to see the team
rally around a coach,
execute the play, buzzer beater.
Instead...
Oh! Get that shot out of here!
You had me going, SVP.
I thought this story
had a nice ending.
That wasn't nice.
No, the block was nice,

Oh, sorry, Cody.

Benny, you're defending Johnny.
Okay?
Now, what happens is

No, you are the pick.
Be-be like a statue.
Good. And now I start
to come this way.

a chance to roll, Johnny.
Roll? -Yeah.

- Statues don't move.
- Forget I said "statue."

That-That's okay, Marlon.
That's fine.
But I-I just want you
to keep breathing,
and I want you to use your
imagination and visualize this.
We are up in Winnipeg.
Championship game
has just ended.
We are at center court,
jumping up and down,
celebrating.
Streamers and confetti
are falling,
and the crowd is cheering us
because we are champions!
Okay, you can
open your eyes now.
Anybody see that?
No.
Winnipeg looked very cold,
so I came here.
I saw it, Coach. I did.
- Nice, Benny.
- Me, too.
Ah. Great, Showtime.
Okay, we're good, good.
We'll just keep working on this
because I want you guys
to just, you know,
get that picture in your mind
because it's gonna happen.
We're going to Winnipeg,
and we're gonna be champions!
- (cheering)
- Yeah!
And I'm going to the NBA,
to Seattle,
because they hired me
to coach up there!
Seattle... sucks.
Well, I-it's an expansion team.
You know, it's a process.
Well, who's gonna coach us
next season, then?
I-I don't know. Maybe Julio.
Good guys don't leave!
Yeah, Johnny, they do.
When the NBA calls, they leave.
I should've known.
(stammers) You know,
it would've been really nice
for you guys to just give me
a little congratulations.

We'll miss you.
Thank you, Arthur.

Hey.
Hey. You're done early.
Yeah, yeah. Uh, they, uh...

Yeah. Yeah.

Hmm. Yeah. Of course he's upset.

roughed up in the press,

No. I'm not exploiting anybody.

you telling me

Yeah, I did,

Happy to hear you
acknowledge that.
Yeah.
I was never staying

You knew that.

it was gonna be hard to leave.
