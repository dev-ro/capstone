NETFLIX PRESENTS
Be careful!
Come on, move a little faster.
- Yes!
- Yes!
Yes!
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, shit.
Oh, man.
- Okay, it was close, man. It was close.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Oh! Oh!
Give me your hand.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Wait.
You asshole!
- Woo!
- Well then.
- Here I come!
- Oh!
- Hey, guys!
- Whoo!
- Come on, attack! Yeah!
- Hey!
- Oh, bastard.
- Yeah!
- Bring it on. Come on, get up taller.
- Are you sure?
You can still back out.
What am I doing?
Ooh!
- Wow, oh, oh.
- Oh, oh.
Hey, hey!
Okay, okay... Oh!
Genius.
Oh, wow.
Wow, Stefan. You're a real woodsman.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
I thought you were a biology teacher,
not a Boy Scout.
I'm both.
Great.
Cold, huh?
At least the sun's coming out now, right?
What the hell was that?
So it's... hunting season?
Okay.
Okay.
So, if you're up for it,
I have a small surprise for you.
- It's a bit of a hike, but it's worth it.
- Oh.
- I'm not up for it.
- Oh, Vincent.
Fantastic.
Great idea, Stefan.
I used to come here with my dad
all the time. He loved the forest.
Mm.
I wouldn't wanna fall.
Well, I'm ready to go back down.
Yeah, give us a second, okay?
We need the presentation by next week.
I don't think they got it.
Ines never delivered anything on time.
I can already see myself pulling
an all-nighter just to get it done.
Do what you have to.
- Problems with Lisa?
- No, we're talking about someone else.
Your fiancée is the best graphic designer
we've had thus far.
Any news about the job?
What job?
The job for me?
It's in the investors' hands now.
They either get out of bed
on the right side tomorrow
and we get the financing, or not.
Okay.
I have little influence on that.
In the end, it comes down to good luck.
Yeah, I get it.
Well, sorry for asking.
Like I said, Roman,
I have little influence over it.
Look.
Aww.
Cute.
Hmm.
What a cute souvenir for our trip.
- Careful, it gets steep again.
- Yeah.
"Five cool guys die in a lame
accident during a bachelor party."
"Taken in the prime of their lives."
Hey, stay focused, guys.
Aye-aye.
Careful.
You all right?
- Hold up, guys.
- What is it?
What's taking you guys so long?
- Roman!
- Huh?
- Faster, faster!
- Be right there!
Come on, let's go.
Careful.
- You got it?
- Hmm.
I'm afraid of heights.
Whew.
Here!
Come on!
Look at me!
Damn!
Everything all right?
Yeah. Thanks.
Whew.
Fuck.
Get up.
Whoa!
You all right?
Yeah. Now I'm better.
Okay.
- Let's get going.
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, what happened?
Got a bit too drunk last night after all?
No. Why?
I slipped. Vinny grabbed me.
Heroic act.
Oh, I see.
Well, then, keep it up... hero.
Aren't our phones for photos?
Just checking something.
Any news from Ines?
How many nude pics
do you get, dude, per week?
Not enough.
Since when do you like girls?
Since I met your mother.
Oh, such a dumbass.
- Shall we move on?
- Yeah.
Don't worry too much.
Investors like us. They'll like you too.
I'll follow up on it for you. I promise.
Did they decide if I get hired? I thought
it depended on the next round of funding.
It'll be settled before the wedding.
I wouldn't screw it up for my brother.
Good?
Do you have to be like that again?
Let them be, man. His little brother
is getting married. That's damn cool.
No? And a marriage that will last.
Isn't that lucky?
Jealous?
- What?
- It's true.
- Well, aren't you single?
- Yes.
And it's quite impressive, thank you.
- So don't screw it up, Roman, okay?
- Yeah.
I'll try my best.
- I thought you already got the job.
- Yeah, it's a done deal.
Okay. If you need any help, let me know.
Okay.
Thank you.
LOVE, LISA
Yes!
We made it. Thank God!
Sorry, Roman.
I'm just exhausted.
Oh.
- That was much closer this time.
- Yeah.
So how do hunters know
where they're allowed to hunt or not?
This isn't a hunting ground anyway.
Shit.
What is it?
Vincent!
Oh, shit.
Where did that come from?
From somewhere back there.
- Do you have a first aid kit?
- Yes, in the car. Let's go.
- Hey!
- Hello! We're down here! Stop!
Don't shoot, okay? We are humans!
Shit, let's get out of here.
Careful. Here. I'll take this off.
- Careful, slowly.
- Thanks. Jacket off.
Fuck, this can't be happening.
Hurry up.
Hey, hold this.
Keep still now. Talk to me.
Do you and Lisa want to have kids?
- Only if they're as cute as you.
- Ah. That's pretty unlikely.
- Hey, guys, hurry up. Stop yapping.
- We're almost done.
Hey!
Help!
Good. That'll do for now.
Okay. Now to the ER, okay?
Get in, come on.
Fuck!
Hey!
Stop shooting now, you stupid idiots!
You've already hit one of us!
It's impossible they didn't hear us. Hey!
Shit! What are they doing?
Fuck.
Shit, guys, flat tire.
Shit!
Take cover.
Maybe they're not hunters.
Come on, get down. Get down!
] Down!
Keep calm.
This isn't real.
- I need to go to the hospital.
- How with a flat tire?
Stefan, how far to the goddamn road?
Twelve miles or so.
But it's an old country road.
Nobody's ever on it.
Yeah, but better than just sitting here.
What a load of shit.
- It has to be an accident.
- I don't know.
- Why would they attack us?
- We can't know for sure.
- So which way to the road?
- Forget the road! No one will be there.
Okay.
What are we gonna do?
EMERGENCY CALL
- We have no service.
- Oh, fuck!
Okay, let's pretend it was neither
an accident nor a fucking game. Then what?
How could it have been an accident?
- Two shots straight in our direction!
- Damn it, Peter!
If it's some kind of stupid game,
then...
- Keep calm.
- Vincent, please calm down, okay?
Okay.
Let's all get in.
We can still drive with a flat, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, yes. Yeah.
Okay.
- Oh, fuck!
- Keep down!
- Everyone okay?
- Shit!
- Yes. Vincent?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit!
I think they're trying to kill us.
A sharpshooter.
Shit.
We have to get into the forest.
It'll be safer there.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
He'll lose our trail in there, I hope.
Can you manage that?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. One after the other.
- Stefan, you ready?
- Yeah.
- Let's go!
- Go!
Shit! Roman!
My phone!
It's important.
Quiet.
- I don't see anybody.
- You sure?
Fuck!
Oh, great.
Thanks.
What's that? You see that?
It's weird.
Who cares, man?
Okay.
Guys?
What's the plan?
Hmm?
Which direction was the mountain
we came from? The tower?
Stefan?
What about compass directions?
Where's the closest town?
Man, I don't know.
That's great.
It just wasn't enough for you, guys.
Boozing in a bar
and a round of strippers.
Sorry.
Don't mushrooms only grow
on the north-facing side of trees?
Some grow on south-facing slopes.
Others everywhere. That won't help us.
Right. That's educational and fascinating
to know where mushrooms grow,
Where would we go if we knew
on which side and in which direction?
Look, what we need is a plan.
Don't you have any ideas?
Huh?
There was the highway, right?
We could flag someone down.
I saw a large road. I'm sure of it.
when we were up on the tower.
- Yes, he's right, guys.
- Didn't you take a picture?
Yeah, I did.
Here.
- This picture?
- Yeah. To the right here.
But it's not as close as it looks.
It's in the southwest.
Okay, that direction.
- Okay.
- Okay.
If our woodsman says so then.
You okay?
Thanks.
Ouch! Fuck! Ah, shit!
- What is it?
- Shit, guys!
I'm stuck. Can you come help me?
Careful, don't use force.
- Shall we? Now.
- Good.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
- Just great.
- Hey.
Okay.
Ah! Fuck!
Roman!
Lisa?
Let's sit down.
Maybe that was it.
No one's out there.
We haven't seen anybody yet.
And now we are a hunter's game.
Let's go.
Weren't we here before?
No.
- You sure?
- Yes.
Oh, shit.
Highway's somewhere that way.
Okay.
There. Here's good.
Careful. Here.
Go.
There you go, then. Okay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Fuck!
- Here.
Damn it! I got it. Out of the way!
- Hey, hey!
- Get off!
- Come on. Shut the fuck up!
- What?
Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?
Wait, hey, wait.
Here.
For your shoe, okay?
We have to work together, okay?
Mm-hmm. Go fuck yourself, okay?
Take off your shoe now.
- Come on.
- Yeah!
Just fucking great.
I can't believe this shit.
Okay.
He's getting on my nerves.
Thanks for waiting.
Do you think we lost him?
Maybe.
Sure, or maybe not.
But if he wanted to shoot us,
he'd have done so already, right?
Wait a second.
What?
Don't you hear?
A helicopter.
Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey!
- Not so loud, man!
But I feel like being loud.
I want to leave!
Shut your damn mouth!
Fuck!
I'm done.
Oh, man!
How long have we not been shot at now?
We can do this!
Let's go!
Hey.
Vincent.
Please.
Which way now?
That way.
Okay.
You sure, woodsman?
I'm sure.
Hey, guys.
- What is it?
- There's someone.
Hello!
Hello! Hey!
We need help!
Hello!
Excuse us, we need some help, please.
Our friend's been shot.
Oh, fuck! Shit!
- Shit.
- What is it?
I twisted my ankle.
Shit.
What about Stefan?
You saw it.
He's dead! The cunt just popped him.
- No, he's not. Why would she...
- Half his head was gone!
No, that's insane!
It is what it is now.
- We need to go! Come on! Go!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Wait.
- Jesus, pull yourself together for once!
- Give him a second, okay?
I'll watch out.
Just a second. One second.
- Are you gonna be fine?
- Yes, I will.
It's nothing.
Oh, shit!
Holy shit.
Excuse me, that's not nothing.
That's pretty fucking bad!
- Quiet.
- Be quiet!
Hey!
Fuck!
We're fucked!
All right? How are you going to run away
if we're shot at again?
If you have any idea, please, share!
What are you trying to say?
Huh?
Erm...
Every man for himself.
The four of us go in different directions.
She can't split into four guys.
- What about Albert?
- Didn't you just say you'd be fine?
Guys, we need to stick together. Please!
We can't endanger ourselves either.
Endanger?
Roman.
Vincent.
Don't leave me behind, okay?
Dude, of course not.
Please, chill out, guys. Stay calm.
Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- Sure.
- She's just a woman, right?
Who has a rifle
and has been shooting at us.
And what do we have? A pocket knife.
A cell phone with no signal or battery.
You were shot
and he can't walk properly.
The only guy who knew his way
around the forest is gone. Fuck!
Why did she have to kill him?
That's enough! Okay?
Anyway, I'm good to go. Come on.
Let's go.
What are you waiting for?
- Let's get out of here.
- Roman...
Your brother's a problem.
Okay. But he is my brother.
Whatever that means, pal.
Ow.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Just distract me.
- Number-guessing?
- Okay.
The bigger number wins.
- Eight.
- Three.
I stand no chance against you.
Tell me something from your life
that I don't know yet.
I'm a very shallow and selfish person.
That I already knew.
Good thing I'm not marrying you.
For sure.
- I should give you the bracelet back.
- Don't you dare.
It's a symbol of our undying love, Roman.
Has Albert got in touch yet?
Oh, he, huh...
He said he thinks it's a good idea.
- But it'll take a while.
- Okay.
Okay?
- And how do you like the idea?
- It's good. It's a good company.
Yeah, depends on what you're looking for.
And by "you" you mean me?
Just don't let yourself
get screwed over, okay?
I won't.
But you're happy there too, right?
Yes, but I'm not his little brother.
Just take care of yourself, okay?
I want to work for him, not marry him.
Could you, legally speaking?
Be careful now.
You better not say another word because,
you know what?
I think I missed a spot... Yeah, ooh.
That's a big spot, actually. Wait.
You jerk!
Are you all right?
Amazing.
Let's go. It was nothing.
Come on!
Move it!
Hey!
Careful.
Uh?
Awesome.
Is this the road we came from?
That was in the exact opposite direction.
How would you even know that?
Okay, come on.
Let's go.
- Can you go on?
- Yeah.
I'm okay.
Hey.
I can't believe it.
Oh.
You have to call the police.
We don't have a signal.
What? Police? Why?
Uh, we were hiking.
And there was this woman at the lake. And...
Can you just call the police now?
There's no signal here either.
We just have a landline.
- Fuck.
- Doesn't always work.
Do you know a woman living nearby?
Well, hikers often get lost.
Especially during the winter.
Mostly older visitors from far away.
They probably underestimate the forest.
- Did you not hear the shots?
- Shots?
Yeah, exactly.
Ah! Well yeah.
- Hunting accidents occur now and then.
- Quiet.
You guys look really freaking tired.
This is my bachelor party.
I'm getting married soon.
 911, what's your emergency?
Uh, hello.
We were shot at and... and actually,
one of us is dead already.
We're in the national park.
In a hut. What's the location?
Get down!
Fuck!
Shit, shit.
I'm sorry, sir,
I couldn't hear you.
Are you still on the phone?
Fuck! Shit, man!
Where's Vincent?
- Huh?
- Where's Vincent?
Vincent. Wait.
Hey.
The door.
Let's go.
Roman, come on. We have to get away.
Move!
Roman, come on.
Leave him. Leave him.
I can't see her anymore.
Oh, fuck!
Be careful.
Shit. I can't see her.
Yeah.
Roman, come on.
We have to get out of here.
Roman.
Roman!
We have to get the fuck out of here.
Go!
Maybe you injured her, Roman.
You're lucky
she didn't just pop you too.
The road.
Let's go!
Shit, shit!
Do you need a break?
No break, dude.
Move!
Fuck!
The cabin was over there.
Come on. Come on.
Hey. Shit!
She hasn't seen us.
Walk.
Go on.
Go.
Come on, what do you want from us?
- Don't provoke her!
- Maybe she just wants our money.
- I have money.
- I don't think she wants that.
All right. Run!
Fuck!
Why are you doing this, uh?
Why doesn't she just shoot us dead?
None of this makes any sense.
Who says it has to make sense?
Go. Let's go.
Fuck.
Oh, shit.
Fuck.
What is this place?
Any reception?
No.
Shit.
Albert, don't.
We have to keep moving.
Right now.
Come on!
Stop bossing us around. It's annoying.
Okay.
Alright, Roman.
You decide, then.
What if she suddenly comes out
and it's too late to make a run for it?
Then what?
Any ideas, boss?
Let's hide your brother
in one of the buildings
and come back to get him with the police.
All right?
Hey.
Stop with this bullshit.
- You think I don't get what's going on?
- Albert, go sit down.
- You can barely stand.
- So what?
What next? Huh?
Albert, can you keep running?
Hmm?
Or can you even help one of us
if we get hurt?
No, you can't.
You know I'm not wrong.
So, at least stop lying to yourself!
Albert, leave it!
Okay?
You're such a goddamn moron,
you know that?
Yeah, sure.
That's why we work together, right?
You started a company with me because
you needed a moron to get your funding!
The company wouldn't exist
without me, and neither would you!
Enough, guys, fuck your company!
Come on, give me your phone.
I'll look for a signal and get help.
Albert...
Forget it.
For Christ's sake!
Fuck you, man!
Fucking asshole.
Prince Albert!
You self-centered, stupid asshole!
You always just take whatever you can get.
When someone calls you out on it,
you pretend it has nothing to do with you.
Well I can do that too.
Roman, good luck.
Best of luck, really.
Don't think that this asshole
will ever give you a job!
- Oh, and ask him about Lisa.
- What?
- Wait.
- Don't. Roman.
- Hey!
- Leave him. Leave him, man.
Leave him.
Let him go. He'll calm down.
It's all right.
It's all right.
You think you and I stand a better chance?
Yeah, without an asshole,
we stand a better chance.
Without an asshole?
He's the asshole, yeah?
And he's not right about anything? Huh?
And your injury
is no problem at all, right?
- Now, what's this about Lisa?
- Roman, Roman. Shut up, man.
There's nothing going on.
Listen, don't fall
for his mind games like that.
He just wants to pit us
against each other, it's obvious.
Hey. Hey.
You said it yourself.
We have to stick together.
You and me. We'll stick together.
Huh? We're family.
Roman, we're family.
All right?
Seriously?
Roman. Hey!
Roman!
Safe trip.
A NEW FUTURE FOR FALCONRY
Now that's broken.
Like that's the reason
you shoot like shit!
Give me the rife. I know how to aim.
With my rifle.
Look.
Who's that?
 Hey! And who are you?
- Mommy, who is that?
- Hey!
That's enough now. Just go!
- Put the rifle away.
- Hey!
Shit!
Forget the fucking camera! Come on!
Forget the fucking camera, let's go now!
♪ Sailing homeward ♪

Hello?
Hello?
Did you hear that?
Shit!
Hey! Dude, this is insane!
Roman!
It's no big deal. Just walk.
Go on.
Just keep walking. Go on.
Hey.
I haven't done anything to you. Right?
Please.
Don't do this.
Please, don't.
Please.
Please don't. Please.
Please, please. I never did...
I never did anything to you...
Please!
What do you want?
Money?
I have money.
A lot, okay?
- Don't do this.
- I have to help Peter.
Shush! Shush!
Roman! Roman!
I... I'm sure we can come to an agreement.
Let's go now.
Roman. We gotta go.
Now.
I can't go on, Roman.
Here, here.
Albert?
Albert, wake up.
Just resting a bit.
For a moment.
Okay.
Okay.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck!
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU, ALBERT!
SAY HI TO YOUR BROTHER...
Hey.
Hi.
Well? I told you I'd drop by.
Yeah, it's really good to see you.
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hey.
- Are you sure it's no trouble?
- Nah, it's not.
- Cool. Come on in.
- Okay.
You can tell him to leave.
Yes, I can.
Seems like you can't.
- I'll get more of this stuff.
- Oh, thank you.
- See you in a bit.
- See you.
Hey.
- Are you gonna get groceries?
- Yeah.
- Can you pick up a bottle of gin?
- Yeah, you bet.
- Dinner in the village tonight?
- If you carry me, yeah.
Gladly.
Yeah, yeah.
Is it still painful?
Mm-hmm.
- What's wrong?
- Stay quiet.
Okay.
- What's with you?
- Shut your mouth.
Okay.
It just happened, you know?
Yeah.
- Of course.
- It's the truth.
- It was an accident. Do you understand?
- No.
I don't understand.
What do you want? An apology?
Please don't.
You'd have to be sorry for that.
So leave me here. Hurry up. Go on.
- What are you doing?
- Shut up, asshole.
Here, put pressure on it.
I know about Anne.
I've seen it all of it.
I'm sorry.
