- Evening, Mr. Nobbs.
- Miss Dawes.
- Good evening, Albert.
- Mrs. Baker.
All right girls...
No finger-marks on the
knife-blades, please!
Well, Helen Dawes, what
are you grinning about?
Nothing, Mrs. Baker.
Sorry, Mrs. Baker.
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Moore.
Your table awaits.
Thank you.
What sweet roses, Nobbs.
You always remember.
Madam.
- Milady.
- Good evening, Mrs. Baker.
Such a kind little man.
- Who?
- Nobbs.
Right...
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.
What do you say -
the lamb or the beef?
Do you think we'll be able to tell
the difference?
Good evening.
Dr. Holloran.
Follow me.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Have the lamb, Doctor Holloran.
It will melt in your mouth.
The lamb it shall be, Duchess.
Sean, Doctor Holloran
will take the lamb.
Yes, Madam.
- Will you have the soup?
- I hope it's good.
Sean!
- There's a stain on your tie.
- Madam?
Have a care, Sean.
Last week it was the jacket,
tonight the tie.
- Yes madam, I'm sorry.
- Remember, there are hundreds,
hundreds of young men walking the
streets of Dublin
looking for work.
Young men, Sean.
Good man, Nobbs.
- Oh! Monsieur et Madame!
- Madame.
Madame, ou est ma
verre de I'eau glac√©?
Tout de suite, Monsieur! Patrick!
- My Lordship.
- Mrs. Baker.
Terribly sorry.
I know we're late,
but could you forgive us
just this once?
We're simply famished.
Of course.
Aubrey insisted we walk all the way
from Ballsbridge.
Well, My Lady, there's nothing
like a brisk walk
for giving a body an appetite.
Come along now,
your table is set and waiting.
Tell me, how is your mother,
dear Lady Yarrell?
- Oh, tip-top, Mrs. B, tip-top.
I certainly hope she will come and
visit us soon.
I'm sure she'd be delighted.
So sorry, dear lady...
No bother at all, Mr. Smythe-Willard
To be sure.
My friends, we do apologize.
Now, drinks.
Albert!
Dudley, Dudley, call the brigade!
My hair's on fire!
My hair's on fire!
A long old day, Mr. Nobbs.
Well...
I won't say no to a nightcap now,
sure I wouldn't.
Only I have a drop left, myself...
Good night, Mr. Casey.
Mr. Nobbs.
Half-a-crown from Mrs. Moore...
sixpence from the Doctor,
tuppence - Monsieur Pigot...
...three pence... Mrs.
Cavendish, when I brought
her stationary...
Another thruppence from what's
his name, the Viscount's friend
and a tanner from the
Viscount and another from his missus.
Two-and-six, and six and
two is eight, and three is eleven,
three is one-and-two, and
six is one-and-eight,
and six is two-and-two, that's...
...four shillings and eightpence.
Ah, Mr. Gilligan-Madam...
so good to have had
you with us again.
I hope your stay was satisfactory?
Yes. Perfectly fine.
Thank you.
For God's sake, man!
I'm sorry, sir!
Look what you've done!
Muddied my boots! Defaced my luggage!
I've never seen such
blatant incompetence!
Are you alright, my dear?
Does that look all right to you!
Where's the Manager?
Where's that fool Sweeney?
I'm very sorry, Sir.
Yes. Yes. Everyone's sorry!
It's outrageous ineptitude.
Clean up the mess you've
made of my boots.
I won't patronize this
establishment again
and I will urge my friends and
acquaintances to do the same,
if you keep this man in your employ.
Yes, Mr. Gilligan, sir.
- Dismiss him immediately.
- Sir, I was...
- Now!
- Yes, sir.
Fine.
Give us the marmalade there,
Mr. Donaghue.
It's the marmalade...
The marmalade, Patrick.
Pass the marmalade to Mr. Casey.
Allways on Tuesdays if
I recall correctly.
Thank you, Mr. Nobbs.
God, but isn't he a smasher?
Who?
What's-his-name - the Viscount.
Not to mention rich.
Young and handsome,
with money and land,
that's the kind of man I want.
I'll wear my new blouse
tonight and give him an eyeful.
Would you care for a tasty breast
of duck, my Lord?
Pink and succulent,
just the way you like it.
That's right, lower yourself.
The likes of him would only take
advantage of a girl
and then leave her high and dry.
High, maybe, but I wouldn't say dry.
Now, girls, stop this trick-acting
and just go on with your breakfast.
It's no trouble at all, mind you.
- Morning, all.
- Good morning.
Somebody didn't bring me my
wake-up cuppa.
I'll have to
lodge a complaint with Mrs. Baker.
Morning, Nobbs.
Doctor.
Did you know we have a Lord and
Lady staying?
Is that so.
...what do you think, any chance?
I'm sorry, there's nothing here.
I was two years at the Ardlane.
Maybe you should have stayed there.
Look, I'll do anything...
Good morning, Nobbs.
Mistress Milly, Master George.
Bunny!... Breakfast!
Shall we wake the girls?
That hat is very important.
Be careful with that.
Make those sheets nice and clean,
good girls.
Are you the fellow for the boiler?
I'm a boiler man.
Well you certainly took your
sweet time in getting here.
Mrs. Baker is waiting inside.
Come on inside.
Follow me.
- Misses Baker, madam.
- Albert
Mr. Hubert Page is
working in the morning
and has come over and asked
us for a bed so I've told him
he can muddle in with
you for one night.
With me, madam?
Yes, Mr. Nobbs. With you.
- But...
- What?
What are you trying to say?
My bed is full of lumps.
Full of lumps!
Your bed was it was re-picked and
buttoned just six months ago!
What are you talking about?
So it was, Madam, so it was.
But you see,
I'm a very light sleeper,
and me being sleepless might keep
Mr. Page awake.
I'm thinking he'd
might be better off on a sofa
in the coffee room.
On a sofa in the coffee room!
I don't want to be an
inconvenience. It's a fine night.
I'll keep myself warm
with a sharp walk.
You'll do nothing of the kind,
Mr. Page!
Of course, Mrs. Baker.
If Mr.
Page is pleased to share my bed,
he's welcome, I'm sure.
I should think so, indeed...
Right, it's settled then.
Mrs. Baker, Madam, the men with
the boiler has just arrived.
Have you a letter from Holmans'?
Holmans?
The plumbers?
No.
I thought you said he
was from Holmans'?
Oh, yes... I
Didn't they give you...
No, indeed. I said nothing about
Holmans'.
I thought you said they gave you...
I said I know about boilers.
And do you...
know about boilers?
I do, madam.
I'm an apprenticed boiler-man.
Well, since you're here,
you might as well
come and have a look
at the blessed thing.
- Thank you, Polly.
- Thanks, madam.
There, now.
It's the bain of our lives.
I'm depending on you to put
some manners on it.
We have our costume ball tomorrow
so it's of the utmost importance
that it's in full working order.
I'll do my best, Madam.
Right then.
Good night, Mr. Mackins.
Jesus!
You're a woman!
You won't tell on me,
will you Mr. Page?
- I'm on my knees.
- Stop that! Get up!
I'm begging you!
You won't tell on me, Mr. Page!
And stop a poor woman
making a living...
It would be the end of me!
I don't want to finish
up in the poorhouse!
- Stop blubbering!
- No, no, no.
- Get up off the floor!
- No! Don't!
Get a hold of yourself!
You'll wake the entire fucking hotel!
- You won't tell on me?
- Stop with your noise!
What were you doing jumping around
like that for anyway?
It was a flea.
I'm a martyr to fleas.
You must have brought
one in with you.
I'll be covered in blotches
in the morning!
Alright... alright!
Just get a hold of yourself.
So why are you dressed like a fellow?
No one would have suspected me
until the day of my death,
if it hadn't been for the flea
you brought in!
So...
Mr. Nobbs...
what do you suggest we do now?
As far as our sleeping arrangements
are concerned?
Any ideas?
Ah... go on... you take the bed.
I'll go downstairs and find
a sofa or something...
- No.
- So what then?
Mrs. Baker
will have my hide if she
finds out you didn't sleep here.
- You take the bed.
- Where will you sleep?
Here. I don't mind.
- Don't be pathetic!
- No, please!
I know her.
Just promise you won't tell.
Jesus!
- Alright!
- You promise?
You won't tell?
Yes, I will promise anything.
I just need to get some sleep.
Here.
Might as well just
make yourself comfortable!
And that.
I didn't ask to share
your bloody bed!
Oh, should have gone for a walk.
Bloody hell...
An hour late.
Has 9 rung their bell yet?
Yes, a while ago.
Good morning, Mr. Nobbs.
How was your new bedfellow?
I couldn't sleep. Now I'm late.
Well I wouldn't worry with that
about being late for one morning.
Good morning, Mr. Nobbs.
Good morning, Mr...?
Page. Hubert Page.
Charmed to meet you.
He's a shy one, our Mr. Nobbs.
Oh, i know.
I'll bring the children's.
Mr. Nobbs...?
Mrs. Moore. She prefers roses.
Lilies make her sneeze.
Oh... I see...?
Yes... well.
I heard yourself and Mr. Page
chattering away into the small hours.
He's a fine man, he is.
Who?
Mr. Page.
Is he married?
We didn't discuss that sort of thing.
Then what did "we" discuss?
Horses.
Yes. Backing horses.
Mr. Page is agreat one for...
for racing... and so on.
For horses...
A... a... cup of tea, Mr. Page?
Do you know, Mr. Nobbs, I believe
this house runs on tea.
I must have been offered
three or four cups of
it already this morning.
Well, I wanted to...
Will I take something in to Mr. Page?
Oh, yes, good girl.
He wants
to work through and finish early.
I declare, the smell of paint from
that laundry room
is making me feel sick.
Oh, is it the morning
sickness, is it?
You just think you are the funniest
thing on earth, Helen Dawes.
So, everyone, this is Mr.
Joe Mackins.
He has worked all night long and
believe it or not,
he has tamed that boiler of ours!
Oh, thank God for that!
Now I've been thinking that we need a
strong man about the house,
So I have asked Mr.
Mackins to stay on.
- Mr. Nobbs!
- Madam.
After Mr.
Mackins has had something to eat,
would you show him
to the yard room.
Yes, madam.
Welcome to Morrison's, Mr. Mackins!
Mrs. Baker has been talking about a
party tomorrow?
It's our fancy-dress ball.
We have it every year.
We don't dress up.
It's only for the guests.
That's a shame.
Where are you from, then?
- Where are you from?
- Cork?
Cork?
Are you mad, are you?
I'm from Galway, of course.
I declare to my granny,
if you don't know the difference...!
Cork, Galway... it's all the same to
a Dublin man.
Oh, a Jackeen, are you?
Never would have known?
Born and bred in
Sheriff Street, where
no sheriff was ever
known to venture.
What delicacy have you got for me
this time, Mister Nobbs?
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.
It's just that I'm afraid...
you see...
in case Mrs. Baker...
Mr. Nobbs.
- You're back.
- Tea-time.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Not more tea!
Do you want to hear my story?
It's not much to tell.
I was married
to a house-painter, as it happens,
a drunk and a bully.
One night he came home scuttered
and gave me the usual fighting,
Only this time he rounded it
off with an almighty kick,
and that was the end of that.
What did you do?
I took his things, and I left.
This is his work-coat,
I've kept it, all these years, to
remember him by, the fucking waster.
So you're still... married.
I am.
Her name is Cathleen.
Girls, it's time to start the dinner.
Hubert Page - have you
dealt with that damp patch yet?
You're a terrible slave driver,
Mrs. Donaghue, so you are.
And you're just a big ladies man.
So you married... a woman?
I met a girl as lonely as myself.
We fixed up to get a place,
sharing the rent and all that.
She had her dressmaking,
I had my work.
But people began to talk, so...
we got married.
What's your name?
Albert.
Your real name.
Albert.
Listen, Mr. Page, I hear tell
you're a betting man.
Have you a tip for
Leopardstown tomorrow?
I'm in need of a winner.
I lost my shirt on Lightning Lad
in the Gold Cup.
Ligtning, my arse!
You did a grand job, Mr. Page.
For your salubrious.
Thank you, madam.
If only I could afford to have
the whole place done!
Could you possibly tell me
in your expert opinion...
how much do you think it would cost?
To paint the whole interior?
Indeed.
Oh, well then...
Eh... let me think.
Well, it's all this end here...
the coffee room...
Is that the dinning room?
Yes.
How many guest floors?
- Two.
- Two.
Well, it's only an estimate, but
I'd say it couldn't be
done for under two-hundred pounds.
Two-hundred! Oh, my!
Well, aren't I the dreamer!
I can't even afford a new boiler.
- Good night, Mr. Page.
- Good night, madam.
I'll dream of more salubrious rooms.
Jesus!
- Mr. Page!
- God almighty!
You scared the be Jesus out of me!
- How did you manage it?
- What?
To marry?
Easy! You could do it yourself.
Waiter!
Mr. Moore, Sir?
Mrs. Moore and I would like a
glass of sherry before dinner.
Fetch a couple of glasses
up to the room, will you?
Yes, sir.
It's been a pleasure, Mrs Donaghue.
But...
when did he tell his wife he
was a woman?
Before the wedding?
Or after?
Did she say her wife was a milliner?
Sean! What in the name of God you're
doing letting our PATRICK up there?
Come along down slowly...
Mr. Mackins!
Mr. Mackins, help us!
Oh, my! Patrick, what are you doing
up those ladders?
Allright, now everyone back to work.
Oh, wonderful!
Ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!
I now call upon the mistress
of the house to open the ball.
Mrs. Margaret Baker!
Come on, bunny, bunny!
Get out!
- Albert, my good man!
- Doctor.
Why aren't you in fancy-dress?
Me, Sir?
But I'm a waiter.
And I'm a doctor!
We are both disguised as ourselves!
That's a good one, eh?
Tell me your name?
What's your name?
You're hurting me.
Wait...!
Helen.
Helen Dawes.
Dr. Holloran...
Give me that now.
Stop!
Five hundred and fourteen pounds,
seventeen shillings and sixpence.
Now... seven pense. And... one...
two... three-farthings.
In six months, I could have
sixhundred pounds...
Doctor.
Your morning cuppa, Sir.
Suffering God, Albert,
what was I drinking last night?
Your tea, Sir?
Your Bushmills.
Oh, good man, Nobbs,
let's have a drop, shall we,
for an eye-opener.
Oh, that's good.
Oh, dear!
Everything all right, Albert?
Sir?
Something on your mind?
Oh, no! No, sir.
Well...
Sir, the fact is,
I've been thinking.
Oh, thinking are you.
Yes, sir.
I've been thinking
I might purchase a little business.
A business! Fancy that.
What kind of a business?
Perhaps...
a little shop...
What kind of a shop?
I've been thinking, maybe
tobacco.
Oh, yes,
a tobacconist's, now,
that would suit a man.
But a woman could
serve at the counter.
Yes, indeed. A woman could.
You're not thinking of
taking a wife
are you, Nobbs?
Who's the lucky lady?
¬øqui√©n es la afortunada?
- Good morning, Dr. Holloran.
- Good morning, Mary.
Good morning, Mr. Nobbs.
Get that out of you way there?
Women...!
"TOBACCONIST - A. Nobbs"
Two counters...
one for tobacco... and things...
the other for sweetmeats.
There's a door behind...
leading to the parlor...
the wife's parlor.
But where do Hubert
and Cathleen sleep?
- Need a hand there, Mr. Nobbs?
- No.
All right, don't lose your rag.
Lovely to see you again, ladies.
- We'll be back.
- Thank you, Mrs. Baker.
There now, Albert
will look after you.
Now she can have a clock on a
marble chimneypiece.
DRESSMAKER
Yes?
Mr. Nobbs.
I was passing by...
Come in, come in!
Cathleen, this is Mr. Nobbs.
Mr. Nobbs, my wife.
Mrs. Page.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Nobbs.
Well now,
we were just about to
have a bit of dinner, Mr. Nobbs?
- Will you join us?
- Oh, no.
Thank you, Mrs. Page,
I wanted to give you this...
You left it in my... in the room.
You came all this way,
just to give me this!
It's the button from my work-coat!
I didn't have another one to match!
You have averted a veritable
tragedy, Mr. Nobbs.
For that you must certainly stay
and have your dinner with us.
Hubert, you take Mr.
Nobbs's coat and hat,
and not have him standing there
like a stranger!
I thought she'd be... different.
Cathleen?
In what way?
She's... real.
Oh, she's real, all right!
So, you've been thinking
about my Cathleen, have you?
Or, have you might find
a Cathleen of your own?
Sit down.
I thought you'd be dressed as a
woman at home.
And what if a neighbour passing by
happened to look in the window?
So you never wear a dress?
It's safer, this way.
But I don't
need to tell you that!
And anyway... it's not like
we've robbed a bank
or killed someone.
I never gave you the
chance to tell your story.
So, why don't you tell me now.
I don't know the beginning...
I was a bastard...
Mrs. Nobbs, the woman
who was paid to raise me,
she knew who I was,
but she never told me.
Maybe she would have one day,
but she died suddenly.
Without telling you who you are?
Yes.
She gave me a picture
of a lady she said
was my mother
and she hinted, more than once,
that my people
were grand folk.
I got a convent education
because of a big
allowance from my mother's family.
But one day, the Reverend Mother
told us that my mother was dead
and that we'd have to leave...
So we went to live in Seven Dials,
and had to go and find work.
I thought I'd die living among such
rough people.
They were poor,
living like animals,
indecently...
Life without decency is unbearable.
Then Mrs. Nobbs died...
And you were what age?
Fourteen.
So you decided to become a man?
One night...
there was...
there was five of them...
they caught me and...
they pulled me apart...
it was under the stairs...
they hurt me...
and then they left me there.
Soon after that,
I heard there was to be a big dinner
at the Freemason's Hall, and that
they were short of waiters.
Back then,
my figure was just
right for a waiter's.
So I managed to get it.
A second hand suit of clothes...
an evening suit.
I didn't think they'd hire me, but
they were shorthanded
and I got the job.
I was paid ten shillings.
And that was it.
Since then, I've served
round the tables
of all the biggest places in
London, Manchester,
Liverpool.
Then I came to Morrison's...
Right, you men, up you get,
before everything on the
table is stonecold!
"Oh, very salubrious, Mr. Page,
very salubrious!"
Salubrious?!
Who does she think
she is, the Queen of England?
Oh, I'd love to get a squint at her,
the old trout!
It must be nice though, Mr. Nobbs,
working in a hotel.
Always something happening,
something to give you a laugh.
Yesterday Sean Casey fell down the
coal-hole steps.
And who may I ask is Sean Casey?
One of the waiters.
And did he hurt himself?
- He got a black eye.
- A black eye.
In the coal-hole!
You're funny.
You'd better learn how to do this,
if you're going to
open a tobacco shop.
We were speaking of Morrison's...
that Helen Dawes.
She's a fine girl.
She's the life of the place, she is.
Helen, is it?
That's not the first time that name
has been heard
in this house, Mr. Nobbs.
Hubert took quite a shine to her,
didn't you, now?
Well...
Look at you, you're all thumbs.
Give it here to me.
I'm just saying, you know, if one day
you should take it into your head
to run off to America, i might indeed
try my luck with Miss Dawes.
How can you deny that
sweet little face
and all those lovely blonde curls.
Gorgeous.
Try your luck, is it.
I wouldn't be getting my hopes up,
Hubert Page
cause I have no intention
of budging from this spot.
There you go, Mr Nobbs!
The shop is a sound idea, Albert.
And you've been shrewd the way
you've saved up money,
all these years.
I don't have enough yet.
You have it all stashed under
the mattress, is it Mr Nobbs?
Easy now, little fellow!
Bring a little water.
You're all right?
My Dad, now there was a boozer,
a fierce hoor for the drink.
None of us ever slept,
we'd be lying there,
shivering with the fright,
waiting for him to come home,
knowing that if he did,
there'd be no place to hide.
Then he'd get up in the morning
with no memory of having beat
the stuffing out of
us the night before.
You know what kept
me from killing him?
What?
The thought of getting on a boat
and hopping it to America.
ALBERT NOBBS Tobacconist
- Good evening, Miss Dawes.
- Evening, Mr. Nobbs.
Miss Dawes,
I was wondering, Miss Dawes if you
would care to come out for a walk.
Pardon me, Mr. Nobbs?
I'm off duty at three tomorrow and
if you're not engaged...
'Engaged'?
No, I'm not engaged, Mr. Nobbs.
But are you asking me to
"walk out" with you?
I am.
Well...
Well the thing is, I'm walking out
with Joe Mackins.
I don't know what
he'd say if I started
walking out with you, as well.
Ah, yes!
- Good night, Miss Dawes.
- Mr. Nobbs.
He asked you to go for a walk?!
That's a good one. The sly old dog!
Why don't you go for a walk with
the charmer, then?
What?
Yeah, why not?
There's a whiff of money off him.
Maybe he can take you out.
Have a good time!
And what about you?
I'm not the jealous type.
Come here to me, Helen Dawes.
If he lays a hand on you, I'll wring
his scrawny neck, so help me I will!
Poke him up.
See what he's after.
Get him to take you somewhere fancy.
Get him to buy you something sweet...
like yourself.
Be sure not to keep him waiting.
Not for me -
oh no, not for Joseph.
Were you afraid I wasn't coming?
Not very.
Did you see that one?
Did you see that dress?
Five guineas if it was a penny.
- Five guineas?
- At least.
Oh, Lord, I love the smell
of roasting coffee.
Would you like to go in?
All right.
Look at the chocolates!
Aren't they gorgeous?
I'm afraid they'd cost a lot.
Oh, well...
we'll go somewhere else...
somewhere cheaper.
No, please.
May I help you?
We'd like some chocolate, please.
What kind of chocolate?
Just chocolate.
Dark chocolate? Milk chocolate?
Creams? Caramels? Nougat? Nuts?
No, a box of chocolates.
To take with us.
Oh, to take with you...
And not something to drink?
No. A... BOX... OF... CHOCOLATES!
- One of those.
- Which one?
- Which one?
- That one
with the two ladies.
No, no, wait...
that one, with the
soldier and the lady.
Wait, I can't decide!
...then my Dad died, and I had to go
out to work.
First I was in service,
then I served behind the
counter in a shop for a while.
In a shop?
Yes.
In a draper's.
Treated like dirt by any bloody bitch
with sixpence to spend.
Where did you live?
I had my own room.
Above the shop?
Yes, above the shop.
Do you know what, Mr. Nobbs,
I think you are the strangest man
I've ever met.
Chocolates-three and sixpence.
If every time we walk out is to cost
three and six...
fourteen shillings per month.
Twice, that is twenty-eight
shillings a month...
two boxes a week...
At this rate... sixteen pounds
six shillings a year.
Oh Lord!
Perhaps I'd only need to court her
for three months...?
Here.
Is this the best you could do?
At least he bought me something!
Oh, look at you Miss high-and-mighty.
Lord Albert put ideas
in your head, did he?
You should have seen him pay for it.
Blood from a turnip.
He must be sweet on you then, eh?
- Next time...
- Next time?!
Ask him for a bottle of something.
What sort of something?
Whisky.
A good bottle of malt.
I like a drop of malt.
Say it's for your brother.
I haven't got a brother.
He won't know that.
I've walked out before, but never
with the likes of Albert Nobbs.
He's a freak, is what he is.
He has manners, at least.
Not like some people I could mention.
His manners won't get you to
America now, will they?
What?
I may not have manners,
but I swear I'm getting
us out of here.
There's no hope for us here, Helen.
None.
All my life I've
dreamed of getting out
and nothing is going to stop me.
America's the only place
for people like me.
Over there, I'd learn
fast and work hard.
And we could have a life!
Will you chance it with me?
Will you!
Yes.
I love you, Joe.
I love you!
Why are we going this way?
You'll see.
Can we not stop and have a cup of
tea somewhere?
My heels are raw,
we've walked that far.
What's this?
Just imagine.
Blue door, cream walls inside,
nice curtains on the
upstairs windows.
Up there a sign:
TOBACCONIST Albert Nobbs
What do you think?
It's big enough for a shop
and for...
for people to live above.
It's a very desirable property,
and can only appreciate,
the agent said so.
In fifteen years, it will fetch
three times what it's worth now.
Sell up then,
move to some place by the sea...
I've always wanted to
live by the sea.
You haven't moved in and you've
already got yourself retired.
But I just...
I just wanted to show it to you.
You ask me to come out with you.
You walk me off my feet,
and we end up in this back-alley!
I've spent my life trying to
get out of holes like this.
Helen?
Helen!
Please take me back.
I'm tired.
Thanks for the bottle.
And the hat.
Oh yes... thank you!
Where does he live?
Who?
- Your brother.
- My brother?
Oh! My brother!
In... in... Mallow.
But he often comes up to Dublin.
Joe!
Joe!
Joe Mackins!
You nearly made me wet myself.
- Here.
- What's this?
Well well...
So His Nibs coughed up, did he?
This is good stuff! Good girl.
Now see if you can screw a
few quid out of him.
A few quid?
The first one's allways the hardest.
But after that, it's
like shelling peas.
You don't know Albert Nobbs
if you think we can get him to pay
our way out of here.
He wouldn't give you the
steam off his water!
He bought you those
chocolates, didn't he?
And now this?
Oh and the hat.
See you got him hooked?
Has he tried any...?
- What?
- You know.
Next time you go out with him,
work him up a bit,
see of what he's made of.
See if there's a sting in him.
I'm not going out with him anymore.
How else we gonna get to America?
You have to walk out with him
as long as there is a
bob in his pocket,
and you have a hand
to pull it out.
Come back tonight?
Should I tell her
before we're married?
Or save it for the wedding night?
But she might call the police,
who'd take us both to the station!
If only I'd been able to ask Hubert
how she did it!
She was like this when we came in.
Is she going to die?
- Has anyone else been here?
- No, only us.
Leave her with me.
And wash your hands, all of you
Scrub them in carbolic.
Mother of God, is it the fever,
is it...?
Go on!
Don't say anything to anybody.
I'll talk to Mrs. Baker.
And wash your hands!
Never mind!
Amelia, for God's sake...!
Come on!
Monsieur Pigot!
Monsieur Pigot, I insist that you
not leave without paying your bill.
Send it on.
But where is my man?
Where is my Patrick!
Why isn't he here?
Who are you?
Everything is impossible!
But there's only one girl
who died and she was
sick before she came here.
This is my livelihood.
I'm sorry!
This is the way I earn my living!
You destroy me!
CLOSED
TYPHOID FEVER
Mr. Nobbs?
Joe...
There's something I have to tell you.
What's that, then?
Is it something I want to hear?
I'm expecting.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm sorry.
I'll take care of you.
Don't you worry.
Come here. Come here.
I'm ruined... finished!
You do have a great gift
for exaggeration, Duchess.
I am?
I'm mortgaged up to my ears
and I have an office
full of unpaid bills.
If the guests are afraid to return...
Come on, Madge,
you'll rise again.
I surely would have
perished without you!
Good morning, Mr. N!
Sweet Jesus and all the saints in
heaven... Mr. Nobbs!
Will you eat something?
Have you some porridge?
Yes, of course.
Mr. Nobbs!
Thank the Lord you're well again!
Is Helen safe?
Oh yes, she's all right.
Blooming you could say.
The fever never touched her.
And, the others?
My Patrick... My Patrick is gone!
Hundreds of others in town.
We don't even know how
many in the country.
What am I going to do?
Mr. Page...
the two of us could
always set up together...
I mean...
perhaps we could pool our money
and buy a bigger shop.
We could run it together.
Just like you and Cathleen did.
You could keep at the house painting,
and I could run the shop.
What are you saying?
Perhaps...
I could live here... like Cathleen.
Neither of us would be alone.
You can't just...
She was my world.
We loved each other.
Come with me.
She made them all herself.
They are very beautiful.
I can't remember what it's like.
Albert
you don't have to be anything
but who you are.
Look at how you have survived
all these years.
You've worked hard,
you've saved your money.
So if you want to go
out and find someone
to start a new life with
then you go out and find that person.
- I didn't say that, Joe!
- Well I'm not deaf, am I!
I know what you said.
You couldn't help yourself!
- Why would I ever say that?
- Because it's what you think.
- It's not fair, Joe!
- Tell me what's fair.
Tell me, tell me, tell me
what you think it's fair.
I'm all fucking ears. Nothing in this
whole bloody place! That's what!
Good job.
Good, good job.
Are you all right, Mr. N?
Are you all right?
She's not worth it, you know.
She's just full of that Joe Mackins.
And he's a waster, if ever I met one.
And he's pushed her
in the family way.
And now they're talking
about going to America.
It's completely show.
Mark my words!
He'll never take her.
Not now! Not ever!
It's a pity this place
isn't nearer Morrison's.
You think we'd be let out to walk
in it if it was?
It'd be Lord and Lady Snot
swanking it up and down the grass,
Not you and me.
You and Joe have been
down to the sea,
haven't you?
And what if we have?
Well, it's just that I
don't think it's right
for a girl to be keeping company
with two fellows.
And I thought...
What did you think?
That you didn't care for me enough.
Enough for what?!
We've been walking out, so-called,
for awhile now.
It's not natural to be just talking,
never wanting to put your
arm around a girl's waist.
But that's for when we're married...
Married?!
This is the first time you said
anything about getting married.
I've put a deposit on the shop.
A hundred pounds.
The agent says he has another offer
and that we have until
Monday to decide.
After that we'll loose the deposit.
"We"?
We'll make a great
success of our shop.
People will be coming to see us,
and having tea with us
in the parlor...
And our wedding will be a great...
wonder.
A great wonder?
Oh, it would be that, all right!
Sometimes I think you're soft
in the head, did you know that?
What kind of a man
would ask a girl to marry him
without ever having so
much as kissed her?
You must not love me if
you don't want to kiss me.
I don't wanna marry a man
who is not in loved with me.
But...
I do love you!
You call that kissing?
That's the way people in love kiss!
That's the way Joe Mackins kisses me!
That's the way I like to be kissed.
I'm going home.
Helen!
Helen, wait...
You're a fool of a man!
If you think me a fool of a man,
why did you walk out with me?
I don't know why!
I wish I hadn't!
Anyway, you won't have to worry
about that any more.
What do you mean?
Please Helen, wait!
What about the shoes
and stockings I ordered for you.
- What should I do with them?
- I'll take the stockings.
- And the shoes?
- And the shoes!
And you'll wear them when you walk
out with Joe Mackins?
Yes!
He won't take you to America!
He'll leave you here.
You and the baby.
He will. He'll leave you.
No.
- He will not leave me!
- You would be safe with me.
- He will not leave me.
- I will take care of you both.
STOP IT!
Why do you say that?
It's snowing.
Don't worry about the hat
I'll buy you another one.
No!
Goodbye!
Your Ladyship!
How wonderful to see you back.
- Miss Shaw...
- Thank you!
I put you in your usual rooms.
There, now.
Joseph will look after you.
Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Hop to it, you lazy fellow!
Hop to it!
What's that?
I never eat anything blue.
Please take it away!
Am I the last to know?
I'll throw her out, the brazen hussy.
I'll throw them both out!
By God I will!
You'll do no such thing.
I can't do it, Helen.
I hate myself for it, but I can't.
It's the same old story
and you know it.
And how many times have you
seen it happen?
It shouldn't have happened!
But it did happen!
But it happened to soon!
It'll change us.
It will change me..
And I don't wanna be
that person, Helen!
I don't wanna be my fuckin' Dad!
I can't even fucking read!
Joe...
Mr. Nobbs.
What do you want?
Helen...
There's nothing more to say.
Please go away!
Wait!
Marry me.
I'll take care of the two of you.
You and the child.
He'll never take you to America.
What do you know, you miserable,
little prick!
You were all talk just now.
Say to me what you
were saying to her!
Joe! Stop it!
You won't... you won't...
take her to America.
That is none of your
fucking Goddamned business!
Joe! Stop it!
DON'T YOU HURT HER!
DON'T YOU HURT HER!
Please get a hold of yourself!
Don't you put your
fucking hands on me!
No, no! Please!
You did this to us!
You're a boozer, Joe Mackins,
- Just like your father.
- I'm not like that bastard.
A boozer and a dirty bully!
GET YOUR PAWS OFF ME,
YOU FUCKING NANCY-BOY,
OR I'LL SMASH YOUR FUCKING FACE!
I don't want you anymore.
I don't want you.
- Joe!
- Helen, no!
No, no, no.
Come with me.
Mr. Nobbs?
Coal, please.
Lucy, would you go downstairs
and get some coal.
A big load of coal.
This has got to be kept red hot.
We have chicken livers,
bacon, black pudding,
black pudding, prunes,
sausages, jam, milk.
Yeah, we got everything.
Now watch out!
Mr. Nobbs?
Mr. Nobbs?
Albert?
That's fine.
I'll take it from here.
Oh, Albert Nobbs...
Dear Jesus, I don't know what
makes people live
such miserable lives.
Rubbish.
OH, MY GOD!
Albert Nobbs, a woman?
Yes! Did you not hear about it?
It was in all the papers.
I mean the death was bad enough,
but then all those years,
and no one suspecting!
Not even you, and you slept here,
in the same bed with him.
Her.
And Dr. Holloran left us.
Took off to England but,
what's her name, Mary!
Said he was tired of secrets.
Can you imagine!
And that good for nothing Joe Mackins
went off to America,
and left me with an
unwed, hussy of a maid,
with a brat.
Now, Mr. Page, I have a heart.
I couldn't throw her
out into the streets
and call myself a
Christian, now could I.
Oh, My Lordship!
I trust you're finding
your suites satisfactory.
Splendid, Mrs. B.
Splendid.
However, we seem to have misplaced
the key to the connecting door.
Could you have your
man open it for us?
I'll have it done right away!
Thank you.
I have an apetite.
Lovely, lovely people.
So you want the whole place painted?
Yes, top to bottom.
You'll have to hire in
help, I should think.
Well, it's a big job.
It won't be cheap, Madam.
Oh, don't worry about that.
I came into a bit of money.
A bit of good fortune.
Well, to work, Mr. Page!
I've put you up in Albert's old room.
For old time's sake.
Mother
Mr. Page!
Hello, Helen Dawes!
I heard Mrs.
Baker say you were coming.
Well, it's a big job
she wants me to do.
Good.
May I?
His name is Albert.
Albert Joseph.
So, it's a "he", is it?
So, Mrs. Baker is letting you stay?
Oh, she told you that, did she?
Out of the kindness of
her Christian heart?
The truth is, Mr. Page...
The truth is...
She says she won't tell the priest
about my Albert
as long as I work here for nothing.
But they are going to take
him away from me...
you know they will...
and they will throw me
out onto the street.
It's just a matter of time.
Well now...
We can't let that happen, can we?
