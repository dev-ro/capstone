CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING
Most of the time,
it started like this...
Practical Treatise of Magic
Fill this out, please...
But, the next morning...
This is yours, miss.
Thank you sir.
No, I don't drink coffee.
It's not for me.
It's for you this time.
Here Lil, for your collection
This one's from Borneo
Java?
And the last one?
Klimanjaro.
Some people have the fun
The past?
No. Past, future.
House of God,
liberation from prison.
The Chariot.
New start. Conquest.
May I?
You woke up lucky today.
Oh, Death!
No. It's positive there.
Movement. Change. The end...
becoming radiance, triumph.
Conquest. The Sun.
How useless!
Don't burn yourself
You do me, now.
The Past. The Hanged Man
What is below is above.
Your future is behind you.
And you plunge into the depths...
of night...
My future is...
Your grandfather the hermit,
protects you.
You don't move. You don't advance.
You advance, but in total immobility.
Stagnation!
Triumphant stagnation.
At least triumphant.
Consequently,
my future is in the present.
Exactly.
That's fine. I like paper...
I like the smell of wax.
Another puff?
Now?
It'll be better tomorrow.
Let's hope so
Well, let's go...
home.
The cigarette?
I'll keep it.
Back to literature.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you please smoke discreetly.
The children are really noisy.
Is the white elephant back?
No, he's gone to Australia.
The naive larks
and the ladies of Flajolie are out.
It's like the spider.
Death with a blue ribbon.
In front of the mirror?
In front of the mirror
July 11th
Don't let your cats out.
I'm sorry. I woke you?
I thought it was the ones
who are after me.
Don't you think you need a bed?
I've to wash.
A shower...Must take a shower.
You  had 3 calls while I slept.
First door on the left.
It's crazy!
My last African safari...
was really crazy.
We were dying of heat.
Every day in the savannah
chasing animals.
I had a hoa consquitador.
A hoa consquitador.
That quite adore me.
He wasn't dangerous,
I'd put him around my neck.
When the natives killed the tiger,
the biggest one
they said..
it was the tiger of Bengal!
Bengal the area of Africa
we were in. You know it?
It's a blue and brown bird.
The Pigmy Emperor had invited me...
but Zouha the Giantess was jealous.
She wanted to marry the emperor
who'd given me the tiger skin.
But since the Pigmy king had giben it to me...
No bear skin?
Zhuba wanted my skin. My skin.
So, I escaped.
I almost croaked
coming back from the jungle.
I lived through hell.
I lost my hair, all over,
plucked clean.
I was scared to death.
I was traumtoed.
Tomatoed?
Yeah freaked out.
I was invited to Hong Kong.
A cool place,
I'll tell you about it.
There was a Japanese guy
who did acoopuncture.
He did it to me.
I stayed for a month.
Afterwards my hair came back.
All red at first,
and then normal again.
And then I came back.
Who's that?
That'^s Gregoire...
alias Gýilou.
A distant cousin from the Luberon
We were childhood lovers.
We had innocent little games.
Playing doctor and all.
On sundays we'd get married
in the gras behind the rectory.
naked as worms, serious as popes.
Now Guilou's coming back.
He's written. I'm waiting.
But he wants us to wear white
and go to churtch.
What's this relic?
A spare forget-me-not.
Forest of knots?
- The forget-me-not of the poor.
It isnt't forget-me-not
it's a daisy.
It was a daisy.
We've to take care of that.
Can you take alcohol?
You can't take alcohol?
No, it's OK!
I have a first-aid certificate.
How'd you get that?
They were after me.
Or I thought it was them.
I fell down. I was afraid.
But who are they? Afraid of what?
I'd been hired to work
in a house...
then, 2 days ago...
-before it was fine-
2 days ago, I found in my room,
a bracalet with the  name of a foreign girl,
I thought it belonged
to the firl who was there before me.
So I took it to my boss.
When he saw it
he turned pale.
I thought he'd hit me.
He locked himself in his office
with his wife.
She was crying,
he was shouting
and I listened.
Then the other woman came.
So, I left.
I moved a bit away
and poked around...
in the drawers...
and then, in one drawer,
I found... two passports
with foreign names,
and one was the name
on the bracelet.
But the photos were ripped out.
Yesterday.
when I wanted to continue...
everything was locked,
the drawers, the closets...
I tried to force a drawer...
and they came in.
I ran away,
and now they're after me.
Who are they?
My boss and the two women.
What did you do in the house?
Nanny.
There were children?
Of course!
How many?
One.
A little girl?
Yes.
How old was she?
Oh little, 7 or 8.
And the women?
Were they dark or fair?
Dark and fair.
But I don't know about them.
They were very secretive.
What did he look like?
Gloomy?
Him? Like your fish.
Black.
It's OK now.
Relax.
I'd really  like a bloody mary.
I have a headache.
Relax.
Lie down.
Take this.
Swallow it all at once.
What's the address of that house?
But, the next morning...
Hello,  Lil?
It's Julie.
No, not very well.
I don't know.
I'm not coming in today.
I'd rather no, just a vision.
I'd rather rest.
Anyway, I'll be in tomorrow.
Allright!
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye.
What was the address of that house?
I told you yesterday.
7 bis rue du Nadir aux Pommes
That's it.
Gregoire?
Ah, Guilou!
Yes, it is Julie.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
You sond so close. How odd.
You're in Paris?
Since when?
This morning!
I wantr to see you.
Today, yes today!
Wait!
Three o'clock.
St. Vincent Square.
Big kiss. See you in a minute.
To my Julie.
The child has become a man.
It seems people live here...
Nestor! Small world isn't it?
Guess who?
I recognise these soft hands.
the scent of this skin
the rhythm of this breath.
Guilou, you haven't changed a bit!
Do you remember the Monday?
when I gathered 313?
311 because there were
5 purple poisoned coichicuros.
The days of blindman's bluff,
I couldn't find you.
When I got home it was dark.
I didn't get dessert.
The day before,
when we plated "Hot-Cold",
you were hotter with another.
Josette chsed me.
And the Rectory?
Has thr Rectory
lost non of its charm?
Nor the young girl
her naivety?
It's just as I'd imagined it.
Nothing's changed!
The gossamer caressed our bare feet...
they were silvery and soft...
When I pressed you
against the hedge to kiss you
There was no one around.
red mouth smeared..
strawberries crushed in milk...
sugared kisses, four o'clock...
snacks...hot.
Kisses and rhubarb jam...
cigarettes stolen from Uncle Ed...
we made blue smoke rings.
The forget-me-not song...
white sun, dark stomachs...
and the wind howled
and we danced.
and we loved Exstasy!
Ecstasy! Perverse
and mystic sodomisation.
Homosexual spleen in the attic...
disguised as Alsatians!
Sodom. Gomorrah.
Biting your teeth Burning loins
Hot lava...sleep...
Sleeping, dying of kisses,
sleeping, kisses...
Sleeping... Kisses...
Sleeping... Kisses...
Give me death, my beloved!
And now, dear friend
go jack-off among the roses
You have become
an unspeakable monster of vulgarity
I want never to see you again.
Good-bye forever. Forever good-bye
It's from the man over there
Go thank him.
Miss Julie?
Miss Julie has gone far away.
I don't think
she'll ever come back
Where to?
Rue du Calvare in Montmartre.
Tonight you're going to get it!
I'm going to get it?
You'll be suprised.
OK, go ahead. Keep it up.
I'll keep my trap shut.
Violins!
If this keeps up, I'm splitting.
I'm eating.
Shut up
I'll tell you a story because
I'm better off than you.
and your hang-ups
aren't worth beans
I've met this girl...
I left my boyfriends.
Shut up! Listen!
I've met this woman...
an American, a real American.
With butterfly sunglasses?
A terrific young woman...
she's in all the papers...
I live at her house.
Shit! Listen! I'm not joking.
She has a pink swimming pool.
I'll invite you guys
to swim someday
In a pink heart.
A heart shape.
You're crazy!
She wants to make me  her pygma...
shit! Her pyg...ma...lion!
And we can sunbathe
Naked!
She's super rich.
She's loaded,
her name's always in the papers.
She's taking care of me because
she says I've got something...
she's going to make me a great...
lady ýf the dance.
Introduce me to her
- No. I've got first dibs.
And then me.
Know what she wants to do to me?
- Is she attractive?
You'll think so.
I've been with her 2 days.
How old is she?
We have to place her, you know.
What color hair?
- Red
A red-head!
Pale with freckles...
She gave me a massage,
you know...
Well she has a masseur
and he did it.
He's got slanted eyes.
Would she do me?
- She might do guys.
I think behind her
there must be...
a big political boss...
I don't know about politics.
But there's money.
Not to mention names,
but there reminds me of...
Yeah an American,
it's the same thing
he's in the papers
She's like him.
A guy you never see,
a billionaire...
Except you see her It's the same degree.
What's his name?
The man, Marylin's producer.
And what's your bitch do?
My bitch!
Get lost, you're crazy!
You're not coming swimming!
- Yes.
She doesn't want slobs.
I'm sure I know her.
She's not a dyke, you know.
She's just come from America?
But she's got a flat in France.
a flat that's an entire house.
Where?
Somewhere. She told me
not to tell, it's a secret.
Your lady's making it all up.
You're really dumb.
She's broke.
She lies to get you to bed.
Stupid ass.
I've been to her place.
I've seen her money,
She has servants...
Don't be so agressive.
I'm not. You're just jealous.
Nobody cares about your American.
When you see her you will.
I wondered if there's any truth
in your story
Listen Alice,
it's really Wonderland.
You can't imagine, I'm ecstatic.
Lucrece is zero next to her.
- I say that for Alice.
I'm getting used to it.
You're so disgusting.
Don't worry,
I know how to choose.
I have good taste too.
So do I,
they're really something.
Where did all this happen?
Stupid idiot. 2 days ago.
2 days...it's not true.
I'm not telling you anything.
You're too dumb.
Lay off!
Shut up!
You said that already.
Don't get mad!
What time?
- Six thirty.
Time to do make-up.
Oh, my sister.
Go ahead Miss Stuck-up.
Miss, your fare please.
Hey, this way.
Did you have a good day?
I don't remember anything.
I've to get made-up.
And now, the astonishing...
the amazing...
the breathtaking...
the bedazzling...
the most mysterious...
most marvellous...
mos scabrous...
most sulphurous...
and so much more!
She's the...
Mandrakore!
It's fake.
It's phony.
It's fake, sweetie.
What were you just telling me?
You've an ideal?
Me? An ideal?
I'd be suprised
if you didn't.
Well, anyway...
It's not worth talking about.
You could take
the kid out some night
I can't take these days,
I'm busy with my American.
Where?
I don't know the mvoies.
Once in a while to amuse him
Eh, Paulo?
Would you like that?
Have you seen my gloves?
Look what you've done!
May I have kleenex, please?
Is your nose alright?
Yes, but this make-up
makes me break out.
I'm tired of this mask,
my skin's tight.
You're not the only one.
That's our job.
I'll become a clown, I'll replace...
old Julien.
A sad clown.
What do you think?
I'll do something like this.
I'll attack them now.
They won't know you?"
They wouldn't anyway. Think they
come for my mug? No way, my ass!
They sleep and drink.
Did you see how they were tonight?
I like the little assholes,
as long as they pay.
What are you doing?
Is tomorrow's act ready?
All ready?
OK, great.
What do you think?
Yeah, it's alright,
but you should add.
some feathers.
She's crazy.
In the back.
Yeah, I've some.
Do you have green? Not there!
Lay off.
She really could do it.
Feathered Myrtille.
Hello, kids.
Hello, M. Dede.
Celine, I've something to tell you.
Tell me here.
I don't have secrets.
It's good news, come on.
Wait 2 minutes for me, OK?
I like you a lot.
You're talented,
full of exburance and promise.
I've got you on contract.
And how!
Well, I'm negotiating it
at the moment.
What do you mean?
I lose on it,
but it's for you career.
An international tour,
Ankara, Istanbul...
Bagdad, Beirut...
Well, then?
You're making fun of me.
- Not at all.
In those places,
a great artist, and French too...
It's worth gold, or better...
not gold, oil my dear.
I like oil better,
no, shit, I mean gold.
You'll see, you'll make some.
Old Dédé told me that...
that he's got a tour for me...
an international tour
to Ankara, Beirut...
Wow, Beirut!
It can't be true,
I don't believe it.
Is he joking?
He says I'm worth oil,
no, gold. I don't know...
Do you think it's a joke?
And this one, what's this?
My cousin.
An American cousin.
With a pool?
Of course.
pink...and heart-shaped.
Shit, what's got into you?
Nothing! Nothing!
I remember nothing. It's no use.
The little sleep.
Look, I don't get any of this.
You've just forgotten, that's all.
You were in shock.
I don't know.
I'm not getting anywhere.
I don't remember anything.
Look, you're just going...
you're going nuts, huh?
Try...force yourself.
That's what I'm doing,
I'm not getting anywhere.
Look, let's start over again, OK?
Try to remember from the moment...
I am starting over.
It doesn't help.
OK, but start from where you
happened to show up  at the club.
Where'd you catch the taxi?
Alright, we'll start all over.
This is going to be very funny.
So...
I was...
You were...
pushed out of the house...
propelled.
Then I was...
all wobbly...
I felt dizzy...
I was pretty mixed-up.
Anyway, I managed
to get to the taxi...
and once in the taxi...
I took...
the candy that was in my mouth...
and put it in my purse.
What candy?
This one.
What's wrong?
I see it.
What do you see?
It's a dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone
swear such a thing
But I was witness to this vow,
I am the guarantor.
If you try to disregard it,
I'll stop you.
Do you think so?
What is pretty does no harm.
But if you say so...
Do not say that word.
You choose the wrong day
for trying to seduce Olivier.
Is that all?
You pretend to ignore the vow.
Don't go in there!
Wâs it in the right or left yesterday?
I don't remember.
You could lose,
but you always win.
You know it is forbidden her.
My own kingdom,
my house, my garden,
my flowers,
my travel books,
for me it was enough.
It would have been enough
for the rest of my life.
But they had to take it away.
He claims it is hereditary.
Well, the scent of these plants
doesn't help things.
Look what I've drawn for you.
Madlyn...
Ties of blood must be renewed.
Must I tell this ghastly story to its end?
My dear friend, what you have begun,
you must complete.
Miss Angele!
Where'd I get them from?
It's odd you know...
they mean something to me...
their faces are familiar.
They come from far away...
- Yes, they must.
From very far. But they don't
look like they've travelled...
Where do they come from,
Zanzibar, Mozambique?
When you're finished
with your z'ing,
and your childishness.
Look who's talking.
I don't know if my mind went blank,
or it's hazy dreams.
It's a mish-mash.
It's like...
four petrified images of puppets.
Yes, puppets...
but it shouts...
it munches candies...
it faints...
it tells stories...
it goes from grey to blue...
and it swoons!
It takes stairs every which way!
And to thicken the sauce,
a little blood!
Wonderful!
Know what?
No, not yet,
I'd rather not know.
Why? It'll be great.
You don't know the best part...
While you're sitting down..
You know the lady in white?
She's my sister.
My twin sister.
We're as  alike as 2 peas in a pod.
The one whose hands are dirty?
I'm broad-shouldered,
but I won't take all the blame.
Your acquaintances
are pretty weird...
You should talk, sweetie,
yours aren't so clean-cut either
You make do with what you have.
What you have, you have to get.
It's clear you've never eaten shit,
the day you do, I'll laugh.
To survive in this life, you need...
dough.
Can't it, honey.
Don't make me cry.
But, the next morning...
What's the address of your house?
7 rue des Pommes?
It's 7 bis...
rue du Nadi aux Pommes.
I should have taken my saw.
Miss?
My Poupie!
It's not true...I must be dreaming.
How you grown!
After all these years.
My little partridge, my bengali
how glad I am to see you!
Do you want your tea?
You know, the other morning
When mother came
to take me away...
Oh, a baker's dozen.
After being coddled
by you for 6 months.
She told me that you'd been
kidnapped by a playboy
and taken by helicopter
to the Peloponese.
Your father did well to leave.
God rest his soul.
And what's become of your mother
with her problems and her men?
I never liked her.
My doll uncles...I liked them.
They were so polite.
Do you ever hear from her?
She flits around.
She sends me a card now and then,
the las one was from Java.
So, she's still the same.
Poupie, do you remember?
The little girl
from the house over there?
After you left, well,
she was very sick...
After you left, she was very weak...
One day, everyone left.
I never saw them again
They never came back.
No news of them.
She was my age.
Remember
how the house scared you?
And no one came back?
Never.
The shutter
have been closed since then.
Maybe someday, an heir will come,
the shutters will open.
and I'll have some company.
I'd like to see my old room.
It's just the same,
with all your dolls.
I haven't touched it.
Oh, five to! I've to go.
Already?
But now that I've found you
I'll come for tea.
I promise I'll come get you.
It's been too long.
It's broken.
It's in pieces.
Do I swallow them all?
Absolutely not!
You have to take them in order.
There's 5 pieces.
Well, start with the biggest,
and end with
the teensy weensy one.
In order.
Here goes.
The kleenex will ruin it.
If you only knew the memories
the dress brings back to me.
The sea?
The mountains?
Both.
The Borromean Islands?
Yes, six in the evening,
the scent of the lemon trees,
the Kursaal orchestra.
She was so pale, so fragile
More than I?
Out of my sight?
Who? What? Is it?...
What, out of her sight?
The dress or the girl?
It's the same ones.
They talk strange.
It's a whole tear, era, school.
Grand tragedy!
smells like mothballs.
Let's continue.
Medium big.
How is your hand?
Better. But I must be careful.
Every moment is dangerous.
Careful. They are fragile.
Miss Angele. Come quickly.
They're doing
the same thing as yesterday.
They'll do the same tomorrow.
The same, every day.
They do it full time?
- They'do it perpetually.
Permanent?
- Perpetual.
They're doing a perputal day.
How about that.
What's next.
Alright, I'm going to do it.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Hello Madlyn.
Did you sleep well?
Today is a big day.
You know I hate little games.
Come, be a sport, Miss.
What a heady scent
Well?
Well what?
Don't keep me waiting.
Which hand?
Was it in the right
or the left hand yesterday?
I don't remember.
You could lose but  you always win
You know it is forbidden her.
Madlyn, I've told you
not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
I've already told you,
the harm you do her.
I do her no harm.
Don't get involved in this, Olivier.
I know better than you
how to handle her.
I've taken care of her for 8 months.
Let me act alone.
I know better that you what I do.
The child is resting.
Please lower your voices.
I don't know
if I should understand you.
After all...
think what you like.
Today, I'm Angéle.
Yesterday it was me.
But it's still her.
I wonder what she's up to.
And him, what's he up to?
Who's he with?
With Camille?  With Sophie?
With Camille
and Sophie and Angéle.
What do those ladies want from him?
That's what we may learn
in the next episode.
What did you want to say?
Nothing you don't
already know, deat Camille.
I'm listening...
You can choose the wrong day
for trying to seduce Olivier.
Is that all?
You pretended to ignore the vow
he made when his wife died.
What's vow?
My sister spent her time
trapping people with her vows.
Don't insult the day
when you speak of her.
But, if I must
repeat it all to you...
Know, that Nathalie
made him swear...
not to remarry, to preserver
the happiness of their child.
As long as Madlyn live,
I've always known
I was there. I heard her.
"Because I don't want Madlyn to
suffer what I suffered at her age".
It's a dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone swear such a thing.
Perhaps.
but I was witness to this vow,
I am the guarantor.
If you try to disregard it,
I will stop you.
I promised Nathlie
Her wish will be respected.
Let's make a wish.
Despite my watchfulness, I lost
the key to the red cupboard.
What key?
Have you seen it?
There's a running battle here.
Yes, something's going on.
I think one of them
is a real slut.
And you know which? The blonde.
With here fragile airs
and stuck-up ways.
She's too secretive.
Thet's a professional bias,
watch out for blondes and all
It's too obvious that she's guilty
for her to be.
Funny thinking.
We'll decide
by the judgement of Solomon
The one who ends up with it...
wins.
Alright, hang on tight.
He doesn't have any.
He's had it.
There's another.
Monsieur wouldn't consider
the mountains?
A dreadful thing has happened!
Do not go in there!
Do you think it could be...
Angele?
But, the next morning...
I'm sick.
Me too.
I want to sleep.
Me too, in fact I'm sleeping.
My legs are gone.
Mine too. But who's going...
You're smart.
Who's going to go today?
I'm going.
You want to go? You're dying to go.
You're there already.
It's not worth going.
We have to be serious.
Let's leave it to fate.
Got a coin?
I'll look in my shoe.
No more money.
Be careful,
and give me back my change.
I'll eat it.
It's Swiss chocolate.
Heads I win, tails you lose.
Damn!
I'm struck dumb!
Watch out!
Tails,
you lost...
How odd...
I'm going to give you...
A little massage?
An artifice.
What colour?
Pink.
Mauve.
Marshmallow.
Better than red,
give me your shoulder.
My little tattoo.
What are you doing?
A double number.
It stings.
Double 33.
Don't cough.
What do I do with it now?
You can go there.
Take your bicycle.
Watch out for traffic.
If I never come back...
kiss Harold goodbye for me.
Would you stop staring at me, you.
Put on some make-up,
your nose is shiny.
The day...
is divided into 4 parts,
corresponding to the 4 seasons,
and the 4 weeks of the month.
Morning or spring,
noon or summer,
period of growth.
Afternoon autumn,
period of realisation.
This is Guilou.
How are you?
I've thought a good deal.
- About what?
We're through.
What?
Since the day before yesterday...
What is this...
I've decided.
Is this really Gregoire?
I've decided.
You wanted it this way.
Decided what?
Could you let me get
a word in edgeways.
How did things go after the square?
You're the one
who wanted it to end badly.
Badly?
I'm becoming a Trappist.
Is this a game?
You're pulling my leg.
I'm becoming a Trappist.
We will never speak again.
You're talking to me now.
Tell me what's on your mind.
If you want to break,
we will
We already have broken up.
I just want to tell you
that it's your fault.
What's my fault?
We can only say goodbye.
So goodbye.
A Trappist!
Oh, shit!
Go masturbate
in the daisies like a Gregorian!
"To Julie,
the child has become a nun..."
He's hanging on.
Power and virtues...
of baby dinasours' eyes
The favorite food
of the baby dinasaur.
who was a discerning gourmet,
was clover.
for maximum efficiency.
use the minimum
the word clever
Replace it with clover
Of course...
Beirut?
Mother?
Oh excuse me.
I interfered...
Celine? She's out.
What?
It's important.
I see...
Of course.
You can count on me.
I'll tell her.
Alright.
What's this?
Where's the Mandrakore?
Who are you?
Don't get excited man,
it makes you twitch.
The Mandrakore is out.
She gave me the scoop.
Don't worry. I'm show people.
Who are you anyways?
Haven't you heard?
of the Kamakazi?
Your men are leaving!
Do your best.
Stay cool. It's in the bag.
Excuse the delay.
Artists, you know...
The Mandrakore is pure gold!
Naive, I'm so naive
Red-headed miss, fingers of bliss.
Naive, I'm so naive!
When I see you, sirs.
If I want to make you sigh,
I light up your eyes.
If I want to do more,
I just lay it on.
Bluestocking, that's what I am.
The shady miss,
a touch like a kiss.
Bluestocking, that's what I am.
When I see you, gadzooks.
I have no heart,
not even for a guy.
Life's played tricks on me
When I pick up a man,
I say right away,
you'll be alright with me.
But when he's through the door,
old loves come back once more.
And memory reappears.
Like a dream...
of a past, that is mine.
And kills me!
Excuse me, but I ...
I always allow myself
to be overcome by...
irrepressible waves of feeling.
When I was childish,
they told me I was a real star...
a shooting star...
and floating star, because...
I had a big rayon tutu.
They said I was suppleness itself,
because I could put
my legs around my neck,
and now,
I want to express
my temperament, my spontaneity.
I'm very lively.
And..I can do...
the candy woamn,
and the headstand woman,
on my little finger,
and the Snake Woman.
And...
lots of other things...
And you, anyway,
what can you do?
Yeah, show me what you can do.
You're here oggling me.
Oggling every inch of me...
Behind refrigerated glasses...
You're not worth beans!
Bunch of...pimps!
Cosmic pimps...
cosmic twilight pimps!
Voyeurs and perverts!
What is all this?
Come and get me!
Come on!
I'll show you!
Want some fun,
bunch of idiots...
Are you chicken?
Come on. Let's go!
Well?
Oh, shit!
Wait! Wait!
It's a misunderstanding.
It's nothing really.
Wait, I'll take the hairs off.
OK. Both at once.
Good morning, Miss Angele.
Good morning, Madlyn.
But why this violence?
These flowers are so pretty.
I thought I'd told Mlle Camille
that for children,
the sweetest smels
are harmful odours.
These flowers are so pretty.
I thought I'd told Mlle Camille
that for children, the sweetest
smell are harmful odours.
Do you think?
What is pretty does no harm.
But if you say so...
Mademoiselle takes risks.
I'll leave you the roses...
because of their thorns.
Good does not always do good.
Mademoiselle takes risks.
I'll leave you the roses...
because of their thorns.
Good does not always do good.
Am I disturbing you?
You never disturb me.
I was thinking...
that today is..
Madlyn's first birthday
since her mother died.
And since I look
so like my sister...
What are you saying?
Olivier, give me
the key to the trunk.
I don't want to see
those dresses again.
May I please have the key
to the little chest.
I understand your reticence.
But, perhaps today...
Madlyn would be so happy.
Look at me. Nathalie's dresses
would so become me.
How lucky that we have
the same complexion.
I don't know
if I should understand you.
I thought that today...
Now, finally...
I should have those dresses.
Mother left them
to the one who could marry first.
Since my sister's death,
they've been kept reverently.
They lie languishing in the attic,
wrapoed in mothballs
and rose leaves.
The same styles
return every 20 years.
I could wear them as they are.
Think of Madlyn!
How happy she'd be!
Excuse me, my dear.
It's nothing.
Did you sleep well?
Today is a big day.
You know I hate little games.
Come, be a sport Miss.
What a heady scent!
It's getting deep.
I've told you
not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I've already told you,
the harm you do her.
I do no harm.
Don't get involved in this, Olivier.
Will she get him?
The child is resting.
Please lower your voices.
I don't know
if I should understand you.
That's what you like.
See, I told you.
But I didn't believe it.
Someone's used my syringe again.
It's inadmissible
and it could be dangerous
Madlyn's still asleep,
should we wake her?
He does not wish her awakened.
He has spoken to you about it?
No, it is I who am troubled.
These frequent naps...
Thiss sleepiness is abnormal.
He claims it is hereditary.
The scent of these plants
certainly doesn't help.
Sophie, look what
I've drawn for you.
I didn't frighten you?
Isn't my flower pretty?
Do not say that word.
If you only knew the memories
this dress brings back to me.
The sea? The mountains?
Both.
The Borromean Islands?
She's not bad, you know.
I know I've already seen it.
...the Kursaal Orchestra
She was so pale, so fragile.
More than I?
Out of my sight!
Who? What? Is it?...
That! That thing!
You know quite well.
Your whims again, Sophie.
Come with me
I must speak with you.
What did you want to say?
Nothing you don't
already know, dear Camille
I'm listening.
You choose the wrong day
for trying to seduce Olivier
Always the same thing.
I'm fed up.
But if I must repeat
it all to you..
know that Nathalie
made him swear...
Stop. I'm having fun.
It's funny.
You'll tell me later.
Good night.
"Because I don't want Madlyn to
suffer what I suffered at her age."
It's dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone
swear such a thing.
What a bitch!
Despite my watchfulness,
I lost the key to the red cupboard.
What key?
Have you seen it?
So she took a bottle.
On it was written, "drink me".
She drank it,
the liquid inside it,
and became tiny.
Mummy!
Help me!
Take care of her.
Don't be afraid.
Why are you hiding?
That was Camille.
It wasn't your mother.
Don't be afraid.
Do you want a candy?
I have one here.
It's over.
I'll never be able to.
She hates me.
I'll never get her
to love me.
I am tired,
discouraged again.
It's just as it was 10 years ago.
when Nathalie and I were young.
She loved me either.
But she was so clever.
It was never Nathalie's fault
It was always mine.
Why are you so shy, Camille?
Why aren't you
more like your sister?
You must get out. Let's go dancing
to the theatre, to the country.
Come, Camille, come!
She was the first
to say those things.
But I was silent
and refused everything.
Why?
Why, they wondered.
But I knew why.
I knew what was hidden
behind her kindness,
her compassion.
yes, her compassion
She wanted to destroy me,
to make me disappear...
And she...
What a shock?
I don't see anything now.
Let's put them back in.
See what's next.
Wait. I want a smoke.
Intermission? OK?
No. I'm going on.
OK, you continue,
then you can tell me about it.
Wait. I'm coming too.
Coming? Hurry?
You are very gloomy.
I don't like to see you thus.
Your concern touches me, Sophie.
But I have good reason.
Camille's appertion?
Camille is not the question.
I understand.
It's what she has awakened in you.
Don't think of the past.
Think of the present,
the birthday we are celebrating.
Look.
The doll I bought for Madlyn.
I'm sure she'll love it.
You are second mother to her.
You are a second mother to her.
Everthing I've done.
I've done for you, too.
Don't forget it.
And I hoped
that you could perhaps...
that we could....
Alas, Sophie...
Madlyn can draw us no closer.
But you would wish it?
I wanted to be sure.
Nathalie's vow...
I respect it as much as you do.
But you won't hear of it anymore.
There's not much of what I thought.
Not at all.
How is your hand?
Better
But I must be careful.
Every moment is dangerous.
Happy birthday, Madlyn!
You know,
inspiration is so fragile...
Please.
You can't refuse.
Madlyn would be so happy.
Please, for us.
You are cruel.
A sonata.
Another sonata.
How deep!
No, I don't know.
I'll begin again.
My hurt hand...
You are so beautiful
with all this red.
It's said you are
the best catch in New England.
I must put my glass down.
It's divine.
I'm drunk!
So beautiful...all this blue.
With this blue, really?
Hold me, Olivier!
I've lived only for you.
My heart followed your steps.
Oh the naughty girl!
The rogue.
A very high tower,
an enchanted prince,
and a tree with daggers.
The Blue Bird!
Yes!
What blue bird?
You don't know that story?
It's very funny.
An enchanted prince.
wishes to join his beloved
in her prison tower.
But a wicked witch put daggers
and razor blades in the tress
and the bird is wounded.
and bleeds...
Oh stop! All that blood!
Blood ties must be renewed.
Must I tell
this ghastly story to its end?
My dear friend, what you have begun
you must complete.
Excuse me, it's time
for the child's nap.
Madlyn, be good.
Don't worry, my dear.
You won't be disturbed.
I haven't often
the chance to tell you
how satisfied I am
with your services.
I am given compensation
accordingly.
Not in the way I would like.
Madlyn is very lucky...
very lucky...
I finished.
Me too.
Madlyn is very lucky.
I'm so disappointed.
Listen...
It's just padding.
We don't know who did it.
We don't know anything more.
What do we do?
It's full of holes..
I don't know.
It's like swiss cheese.
We don't know the end.
I hate that.
Anyway, we're not going back.
Listen. I have an idea.
At the library...
At the library?
Take this off. I can't stand it.
Bend your head forward.
Wait.
The sun is coming up.
In a return to the source...
as natural as temporal...
It's the beginning.
...of the four basic elements.
Water.
Air.
You don't think it's polluted?
No, I don't think so.
Very gently!
It's the most fragile part.
You can pour it all.
Earth.
Clover.
How much?
Two stalks.
No, two big ones.
The same size.
Wait, a little one's cheating.
Fire.
The fire will shoot out
from the four cardinal points...
and from it's conflagration
you'll ontain...
the memory potion...
called "herbed wine"
by the ancients.
Because of the clover.
P.S. Beware of side effects.
Take in small doses.
OK, let's go.
We'll both start
at the same time.
Can Harold have some?
A little drop.
One drop.
He swallowed it.
It's good.
Very good. Some more...
It's so good.
Let's have another. It's a part-time.
But I feel funny...
I feel fine.
But, really fine.
Mademoiselle takes risks.
Compared to the candies...
Someone's used my syringe again.
It's inadmissible,
and could be dangerous.
Madlyn's still asleep,
should we wake her?
He does not wish her awakened.
Your whims again, Sophie.
Help me!
Take care of her!
I knew what was hidden behind
her kindness her generosity.
She shone all the brighter
to the point of blinding them all.
She knew how to destroy me,
make me disappear.
stiffle me...
I had my own kingdom.
It was enough,
my house, my flowers...
my picture books...
my travel books...
but they had to take it away.
Your sister's getting married.
Your sister's getting married.
They'll come to live here,
it's logical, it's family.
And they love each other...
They must have secrets,
they must be left alone.
Wouldn't you like
to travel, Camille?
See the places you've dreamed of?
Borneo, Shangai,
Macao, the Sunda Islands...
With gentle words they drove me out,
and with so much money...
I travelled a lot.
Around the world twice,
but it was
as if another were doing it.
Only at night, was it I...
in my dreams...
Always the same dream,
the same house...
My house
Now she's dead. I'm alive. Free.
And it's my house.
The won't drive me out again.
I'll do anything.
Anything.
The child will have to give in,
don't you think?
And blood ties?
They must be more important
than everything else.
They must be renewed.
Mustn't they?
Don't you think?
Why don't you ever answer?
I have to recover,
give me some more.
Blood ties must be renewed.
My head aches.
Everything's spinning.
Julie, I see you here...
and there...
Why are you behind my back?
Where?
-There.
Where?
- There
Harold's tipsy too.
Madlyn, be a good girl.
Don't worry my dear,
You won't be disturbed.
I haven't often
the chance to tell you.
how satisfied I am
with your services.
I am given compensation accordingly.
Not in the way I would like.
Madlyn is so lucky
to enjoy your constant care
Could Monsieur
make propositions that...
are more precise?
I had thought of
taking Madlyn to the sea.
You could come with us.
Impossible! The more sight of a...
fish...makes me amnesiac.
Monsieur wouldn't
consider the  mountains?
A dreadful thing has happened!
Do not go in there!
You are quite mysterious,
my dear friend.
Your concern tickles me, my sweet.
But I have reasons for this mystery.
Both our lives depend on it...
Has my coming troubled you?
Let's see...
Wait, my turn.
Your arrival awoke in me
another world that slumbered.
What you've done,
we've done together.
We have given birth to night.
What would I do without you?
I hope...
that we might still gather
the stars of the 1001 nights?
What I've done
I couldn't have undertaken...
but your presence, my sweet.
This monstrous child...
Will you not reproach me for it,
someday?
My sweet,
nothing could bring us closer.
My darling,
I wanted to hear you say it.
Our desires
will crystallise together.
I'm scared.
Me too.
I'm scared, but we have no choice.
- We've got to to do something.
Let's go.
Have to save her.
If we never came back,
what would we do?
Happily, we've still got...
dinasour looks and clover
We must save the kid,
all the costs.
I want to get her out.
We'll...get her out.
We'll get her out,
but we can still be scared.
We can sleep too,
even if we are scared.
I don't want to sleep.
I might dream if I sleep.
Everything's spinning.
I can't sleep.
I laugh when I'm afraid
Me, when I'm sick.
I feel sick to my stomach.
Once upon a time.
Twice upon a time.
Thrice upon a time.
Only, this time...
it won't be like that
not like the other times.
We'll get her.
Stop the machines.
But, the next morning...
Shit, we got here too early.
Time for a cigaratte.
Clever.
Clover.
Clover.
Clever.
First round for us.
I can't see straight.
Where?
Don't try to be clover.
Up to the staircase.
A real mortuary.
We'll run into stuffed ghosts.
What do we do?
In there.
Let's go.
OK. You change. I'm going in.
You look like a kapo
from  the country.
You think you're so clover!
I'm going
to brighten up your façade.
Make oranges grow on an olive tree.
Misss...Angéle...Terr,
Mys...tery...Angéle...
What do you mean?
This woman's a drag queen.
No, a defrocked nun.
Everything's spinning...my God.
Have a drink from the flask.
Give me yours.
Time's spinning too.
I'll be late
for the commomile scene.
Here, take this one.
Eye of lynx and wooden head, yeah.
I've forgotten my lines!
I thought I'd already told you,
that the finest scents
are the best perfumes.
That's good enough.
Alright, let's go.
I don't remember.
You could lose, but you always win.
You know it is forbidden her.
I've told you
not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
The harm you do her.
I do no harm.
Don't get involved in this, I know
better than you know to handle her.
I've taken care of her for 8 months.
Let me act alone. I know
better than you what I do.
May I have...the key
to the red cupboard.
I don't know
if I should understand you.
It's taking off.
I'm not a  bit clover.
I put the key in the silence,
I mean I mixed up 2 scenes.
We're in deep shit,
they'll be on to us.
They didn't notice.
And you, Miss Ter, have you some
juicy secrets to tell me?
Imagine, my dear,
I glimpsed Camille in the attic,
rumaggin about in her things.
Did she say hello?
I sneezed. She didn't flinch.
They're up to their neck in this.
The 2nd act is about to begin.
See if the coast is clear.
Someone's used my syringe again.
You nuts?
It's incomprehensible
and totally shocking...
Madlyn is still asleep?
Perhaps we should wake her?
But he, caught between two fires...
Let her sleep.
He has spoken to you?
Has he said something to you?
It's me...I'm...
I'm getting stuck...these..
these whiffs of...
It's hermetic.
Well, the scent of these plants
doesn't help things.
Look what I've drawn for you.
Let's see.
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Isn't my flower pretty?
She's the mur...der...ess!
Shit!
The bitch! Tea without sugar!
I didn't know I was so emotional.
The bastards!
They didn't even offer me champagne!
It's not funny.
Well, I've won our bet.
We'll talk about it
when we're through with this.
I thought I was done for.
Whether it's Sophie or Camille,
makes no difference.
We'll continue as planned.
Help me!
Take care of her.
Do not hide under the pillow.
Don't be afraid.
It wasn't youre mother
it was Camille.
Do you want a candy?
I have one care for you.
Open your mouth.
You'll sleep now.
Sleep.
My house,
my garden, my flowers...
My travel books...
I'm going to swoon.
It would have been enough...
I'm going to faint.
Your sister's getting married...
They'll come to live here,
it's logical.
They love each other.
Lily-livered. Go drink some potion.
Wouldn't you like to travel, Camille?
See the places you've dreamed of,
Shanghai, Macao,
the Sunda Islands..
They gave me gentle words,
and money, lots of money
I went around the world twice...
You're later. I've been
waiting for 2 minutes.
I had to answer the call of nature.
I'm not made of clover.
Anyway, don't worry.
They won't get us now.
Eye of lynx, we've got it made.
It's said you are
the best catch in New England.
You are so beautiful
with all this red.
You're so palid
with all this black.
I must put my glass down.
It's divine. I'm drunk...
- We're not in a melo anymore
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo...
Oh great clover,
it's your turn.
Madlyn's hand.
Excuse me, it's time
for the child's nap.
You'd lost your charm.
Not that way, follow me.
Put your leg here.
Wait.
Together now.
It doesn't hurt
to fall off the moon.
But we failed again.
The dinosaurs took back their eyes.
Someone we know!
What will we play now?
No more playing, ever!
We're going out.
We'll take you boating.
It's raining.
Got a smoke?
We'll chew it, OK?
Miss, you lost your squirrel.
