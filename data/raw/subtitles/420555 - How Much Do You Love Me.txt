HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE ME?
Good evening.
How much do you charge?
One hundred and fifty euros.
We go to a lounge
and you do what you want.
Champagne is extra.
l don't feel like champagne.
You have to buy a bottle.
How much is a bottle?
One hundred and fifty euros.
How many customers do you have?
Per day?
Per day.
Are you a cop?
l just won the lottery.
Tax-free money.
How much did you win?
Four million,
five hundred
and forty-two thousand euros.
l accept.
What do you accept?
What you're going to propose.
l propose one hundred thousand euros.
What for?
One hundred thousand a month.
What for?
One hundred thousand a month
until l'm broke.
Will you tell me what for?
To live with me.
You won't hurt me, will you?
You mustn't hurt me.
You must treat me right.
Yes, ok.
You must respect me.
Just because l'm a whore
doesn't mean anything goes.
You can touch me, of course.
Touch me all you want,
but with gentle hands.
Yes, ok.
You could
give me a little advance.
lt's standard practice.
l'll buy you dinner.
The thing is, l'm not very hungry.
Really?
l feel a bit faint.
What's the matter?
Shall l call a doctor?
No need.
Are you sure?
l'm calling anyway.
No, really, l'm fine.
- Where did you feel the pain?
- ln the stairway.
- That's not what l meant.
- Then what?
Where's the pain? The left arm?
- Your heart's racing.
- Obviously!
- Calm down.
- l can't!
- Wham! lt skipped a beat!
- l knew it.
- Anything troubling you?
- Troubling me!
l'm just doing my job.
- Did you see that woman?
- Naturally.
What is she doing?
Packing a suitcase. Who gives a damn?
l give a damn!
ls she leaving you?
l'm moving in with him.
- l don't get it.
- What's not to get?
Why you feel so bad!
That woman you see
is moving in with me!
Right, right!
- Will she like it?
- l don't know!
Neither do l. l'm nervous!
We can move if it's too small for you.
Don't start spending like crazy.
l already feel at home.
Relax.
Put the luggage down.
What's your name?
Francois.
Sit down, Francois.
Make yourself comfortable.
l'm Daniela.
So, how's that heart of yours?
Frankly, not great.
lt's my weak spot.
lt's always been fragile.
ln high school,
l was always excused from gym.
We'll live nice and slow.
Nice and slow, how?
Like this. Like right now.
Why? What's happening right now?
Nothing.
That's just it.
You're resting.
Now...
Close your eyes.
l'll take off my coat.
Your coat?
Close your eyes, l said.
l'm not taking any risks.
You opened them!
What are you doing?
- Taking off my coat.
- Why?
l'm your wife.
lsn't that what you wanted?
Yes.
Then l can take off my coat.
Yes, absolutely.
Unless it annoys you.
Tell me if it annoys you.
No, for now it's fine.
Shall l continue taking it off?
Please do.
Are you ok?
l'm fine.
Let's rest for a while.
l'd like that.
l need to get used to this.
We have all the time in the world.
Don't worry.
The bed is ready. l'm ready.
Everything is ready.
l love you.
Really?
lt's only natural.
All men love me.
That's what l was made for,
to be loved.
All l have to do is move a little.
Watch. l'm moving a little.
How does it make you feel when l move?
Stop.
Why should l stop? l'm with my husband.
Can't a wife excite her husband?
Wait! We don't know each other.
Only barely!
We must get acquainted.
Yeah, but how?
l don't know.
Like this,
for example.
What's the matter? ls something wrong?
l wasn't expecting
it to be like this.
Like what?
Come.
Let's go to bed.
Your coffee-maker's crap.
lt makes terrible coffee.
What are you doing up already?
My man's going to work,
l'm making his coffee.
Oh, my God, my God!
You're not going to faint again?
No, l'll be ok.
l'll be ok.
What would you like for dinner tonight?
l don't know. Whatever you want.
Got anything against ltalian food?
l love ltalian food.
What about ltalian shoulders?
Please, l have to get going now.
What about ltalian breasts?
Do you like them?
l'm telling you, l have to go.
Where?
To work.
Do you see my breasts?
Of course l see your breasts.
What do you think of them?
They're beautiful.
So why are you breaking
our balls with yourjob?
Are you a ball-breaker?
Don't you think it'd be nicer
to stay with me?
We'll lounge until noon,
then go to a restaurant
and get us some oysters.
Don't you like oysters?
l love them.
Then we'll go to the movies.
An American film.
But we won't watch the film.
We'll kiss, caress each other...
Do you like my plan?
Yes.
But l have my job.
What is yourjob, anyway?
l don't know, it's an office.
What kind of office?
lt's my job. l have ajob.
l contribute to my country's economy.
l'm living with an office worker?
Absolutely.
This'll be a barrel of laughs.
What is it?
What's the matter?
- ls it your heart?
- l'm just a little dizzy.
l'm calling a friend.
A friend? What friend?
He's a doctor. And a very good friend.
But is he a good doctor?
This is Daniela.
Hello.
May l ask who this girl is?
Why, don't you like her?
l'm asking you who she is.
An ltalian girl.
Don't bullshit me.
Remember l'm your doctor.
And my friend!
We both have the same advice.
- Which is?
- No.
- What do you mean?
- You can't live with this girl.
Why not?
Have you seen the goods?
Of course l have.
You think your heart can handle it?
She said she'd be careful.
Have you ever known a careful woman?
And will you be careful?
How many times a day
will your heart rate climb to 140?
How many times?
l'm not your doctor anymore.
Get dressed!
You'll be humping that woman
day and night!
l can't condone it.
A guy with a weak ticker
shouldn't be with a nuclear bomb.
l don't know if you realize
that girl is a bomb!
Where did you meet her?
lt doesn't matter.
Can't you tell me?
Sure l can, but frankly,
she's all that matters.
Can l ask you a question?
A question?
What question?
- Francois.
- Yes?
Where did you meet him?
ls it really important?
Yes, it's important.
ln a bar.
What kind of bar?
A hooker bar.
Let me tell you something, young lady.
Francois is my best friend.
His heart is weak.
lf anything happens to him,
l'll blame you.
l'll take good care of him.
He mustn't get agitated.
At night, he must sleep.
During the day, he must walk.
But slowly.
He mustn't do anything too fast.
Or too hard.
And go easy on the pasta.
Don't make it every day.
Are you finished?
Excuse me?
Are you finished?
Sorry, l'll stop.
Leave pasta alone!
l'm ltalian.
l understand.
Pasta and everything else!
No problem.
ls it my fault
if l've got nice curves
and when men see me,
their pants feel too tight?
Suddenly they need a bigger size!
What have l done?
You talk to me like l'm a whore!
Not at all!
What's going on? What are you doing?
Nothing, l swear!
l'm sick of being a whore!
l want a normal life!
A nice guy l can take care of!
Not necessarily handsome, but nice!
Look no further!
Even if he were sick!
l'd take care of him.
l'd be his nurse,
l'd take him for walks!
On weekends, we'd go to the seaside!
ls that such a crazy dream?
l'll be going now.
That's a good idea.
Thanks for lifting the mood.
You're a great friend.
Better than no friend at all.
She's not a whore, is she?
You're not with a whore?
What if she was?
What difference would it make?
None. You're right.
She'd still be a woman.
Absolutely.
What did you do?
Went away for the weekend.
Where?
To the seaside.
May l ask which sea?
The North Sea.
She loves the North Sea.
We ran a little.
Where?
- On the beach.
- Who ran?
Both of us. We both ran.
l barely ran.
l'm sorry, but you ran.
And you ran well.
Why did you run?
l told you not to run.
What were you running after?
Do you even know?
After her.
- Was she running away?
- Not at all.
Then why was she running?
To turn him on.
So he could see my breasts move.
Then we fucked.
Where?
ln the car.
Why in the car?
lt was raining.
He didn't do anything.
l was on top.
150 over 90.
That's not so bad.
You were 130 over 80 before.
Maybe he ate too much.
What did he eat?
Oysters.
They're bad for your cholesterol.
What's good for it?
Recommend something!
l don't give a shit who dies,
l see it all the time!
l'm used to it.
But you're my friend.
Don't make yourself sick
over my newfound happiness!
You were happy with Brigitte.
Brigitte was a whore.
l'm sorry, dear,
but sometimes good girls are whores,
while a whore can be a great lady.
More spaghetti?
No thanks, l'm full.
Coffee?
No, l'm jittery enough as it is.
l have to go to the hospital.
After the oysters, you got a room
and fucked some more?
No, we made love.
Cars are for fucking,
rooms are for making love.
l've got this nurse.
A woman in my department.
She's forty-five
and already lost a breast.
The cancer has metastasized.
l'm treating her.
Watching over her.
For me, love is no picnic.
lt's painful.
lt requires total commitment.
All we can do is hold hands.
She begs me not to let go.
You gotta love a woman
to get by on five fingers.
You never told me.
Well, you know, my life is no museum.
Her name is Gissle.
l'd known her for a long time,
but never noticed her.
One day she came to me.
''Monsieur,'' she said,
''l believe l'm ill.''
She had little breasts like fists,
ready to punch out any invaders.
But she'd let her guard down,
and been attacked from the inside.
''l'd like to keep my breast,''
she told me.
''Not that l have many lovers,
but you never know,
maybe some scatterbrain,
or a lost soul...''
''l am that lost soul,''
l told her.
''l don't have much to offer,
''besides my tired old life.
''l'm just a poor doc
healing poor patients.
''But if you like my poor face,
you'll see it's like any other,
''a decent guy's face.
''With eyes that know
how to say thank you,
''and a mouth that occasionally
cracks a smile.
''Even if the smile
''is often a sad one,
''mixed with tears.''
l don't know why
l'm telling you all this.
l guess your love got to me!
You know, Daniela,
l'd never seen a woman like you before.
l knew they existed.
Sometimes you see them in magazines.
But like this, in real life,
right in front of me,
it's very strange.
This time l'm really leaving,
before l start embarrassing myself.
Andr?
You know l'm your friend.
l'm your friend, too.
Even if it's not always easy.
l'm on my way.
l'm sorry dear, l won't be long.
lt's that friend l told you about,
with the weak heart.
l can't say no, he's a friend.
He's not much fun,
but he's my only friend.
lf you want some herb tea,
it's in the thermos.
Take care not to burn yourself.
That thermos is amazing,
it keeps all the heat in.
- What's wrong?
- lt's not me.
- lt's her.
- What's she got?
- l don't know.
- So why am l here?
- She's ailing.
- What's ailing her?
- She's ailing!
- May l go in?
Of course you may. Careful!
She's nauseous.
What did you eat?
- Veal olives.
- At a restaurant?
At a restaurant.
- What have l told you?
- l know.
l'll examine her.
Shall l take off my pajama top?
That won't be necessary.
But it would be better.
Daniela.
Andr?!
What happened?
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing!
Why are you naked?
So he could examine me!
He couldn't handle it!
Call the firemen!
What firemen?
This is not the time!
15b Rue Chevalier de la Barre,
5th floor!
Hang in there, Andr?,
help is on the way.
Expecting someone?
A certain Gissle,
he spoke of her.
- Gissle Bloch?
- That's right.
She died five years ago.
Life is really a bitch.
How'd you like to go to ltaly?
What's ltaly like?
Tender, and hot.
You can hear people
singing in the streets.
Look how beautiful you are with me.
Love really suits you.
We know you, Baron.
That smile means something.
You're not a guy who smiles
for no reason.
lt's more than a smile,
it's almost a laugh.
- Feel like laughing?
- What's so funny?
You never laugh.
What the hell are you up to?
Did you meet someone?
My private life
is none of your business.
Sure it is, in a big way.
Why?
We're interested in you.
ln your life.
You know nothing of my life.
That's just it, we want to know more.
You met someone.
l never bought the bachelor act.
You look like a guy
who's up to no good.
Did you meet someone?
l met no one.
Then why are you beaming like that?
You look like the sun.
Sorry pal,
but l call that an afterglow.
Look, he's laughing.
ls the broad at your place?
We want to meet her.
l want to go home.
Good idea. You go home,
and we'll come with you.
l should let her know.
Sure, let her know.
Tell her to break out the booze.
Sneaky bastard!
He tried to hide her from us.
Hello, this is Daniela.
Please leave a message.
l'll call you back.
lt's her voicemail.
Daniela.
The bed's been used.
This is no time forjokes.
l want to be alone now.
She may come back.
How many days have you been together?
Did she live with you?
There's no girl stuff here.
l want to be alone now.
We couldn't do that, we're not assholes.
Where's your whiskey?
l want to be alone now.
Get lost, guys.
You can't do anything.
We girls are going to stay.
We'll take care of him.
l want to be alone now.
He doesn't want you.
He doesn't want anything.
Wouldn't she be nice to bone?
lf l had the cash, l'd bone her.
Where've you been, baby?
We thought we'd lost you.
l made an attempt
to become a good person.
l guess it wasn't a success?
l'm the kind of girl who needs a bar.
When l stay home,
the day just drags on and on.
Don't go, Monsieur.
ln five minutes
l'll have a young woman for you.
A little company will do you good.
You think so?
l know so.
Come have a drink.
We're here to make life
a little brighter.
Have you got money?
l just won the lottery.
Was it a...
significant amount?
Several million euros.
This is Muguet.
l'll be right with you.
Hurry back, ok?
Don't be a stranger!
Why are you so sad?
Winter is too long.
You need to go where the sun is.
What sun?
Where it's summertime.
The Seychelles, for example.
l've heard it's lovely there.
Depends who you're with.
Let's say with me.
Give me some champagne.
l'm on to a good thing.
l know a good thing when l see one.
l can read faces.
He just won the lottery.
He won't say how much.
But he mentioned millions.
Millions of what?
Euros.
Will you take me to the Seychelles?
l'll see to it
you get attached to me.
How much do you want to make?
A thousand euros a day.
That's the rate.
Plus presents.
Will you give me presents,
if l'm good?
Of course l will.
Give me an advance,
to show your good faith.
l don't have much on me.
l'll come back tomorrow.
No. l'm sticking with you, like glue.
You can help me pack my suitcase.
Tomorrow we'll go to a travel agency.
And the bank.
Meanwhile, let's get acquainted.
Unless you'd rather wait for the trip.
Waiting's good,
it makes love grow.
lf you can hold off.
We'll see.
We'll sleep in the same bed,
and play it by ear.
l like surprises.
Francois
Someone's calling you.
My name's not Francois.
What do you want, Daniela?
Tell him it's not my fault!
l don't know what l'm doing!
My head's spinning.
l'll tell him.
lf l see him, l'll tell him!
What right does she have
to talk to you?
l know her a little.
Well, it's time to forget her.
That'll be difficult.
What do you mean?
Hate to break it to you,
but she's a whore.
What's the matter?
All mixed up?
Listen to me, and don't interrupt.
Yes Francois, l'm listening.
- l have to tell you something.
- Go ahead?
Those few days
we recently spent together...
They're enough to fill my entire life.
Now l know that happiness exists.
Francois
What?
l have something to tell you, too.
What?
There's another man in my life.
A man who counts?
A man who counts.
Because with me it was for the money?
Only the money?
l told you she was a whore.
And what are you?
A younger one. More fun.
You'd better be fun,
l'm in bad shape.
She'll be fun.
l know her, she's good.
She's just getting started.
She's not damaged yet.
l'm damaged.
lt's all settled then.
For me, it's not settled at all!
What do you want?
Your money back?
How much did you give me?
One thousand? Two?
Take it!
l don't give a shit about money.
l'm in it for the pleasure, got it?
For the pleasure.
Are you ready for this?
You're at 160, pal.
Better slow down a little.
Level off.
Did you ask him to come?
- Who?
- The doctor.
Of course. l don't want to bury you.
And it's a good thing l called him.
This is Francois,
the friend l told you about.
Your pressure's rising,
you need a shot.
Screw you,
you're not my kind of doctor!
That'll be fifty euros.
Fifty euros, got it?
l'll pay, no need to get testy.
We're not here to fool around.
You consume, you pay.
l'm paying, l'm paying.
Don't forget it's ajob to her.
Not a love story.
l'm the love story.
l can break your knees whenever l want.
l push a button, and bam!
Goodbye knees. Crippled.
That guy is appalling!
l've never seen anyone like him.
What kind of guy is he?
He's my guy.
What do you see in him?
He's got a big one.
Very interesting.
A pretty picture of womanhood,
pure poetry.
Listen, kid,
you wanted to taste the night?
Well, you're tasting it!
Sometimes it's bitter.
Why do you try so hard to be a whore?
- l am a whore!
- Not to me, sorry.
What am l to you?
A woman who let her guard down.
And got hit in the face.
Hit with what?
Hit with tenderness.
Stop, you'll make me cry!
lf you cry, l'll eat my hat.
You really think l'd cry over you?
What is it?
- l'm your neighbor.
- Yes, l know you.
You don't know anything about me.
You barely even say hello.
l'm sorry.
l bet you don't even know my name.
- lt's late.
- Yeah, but l'm working.
Trying to work. l'm a translator.
lt's a hard job and the pay's terrible.
What can l do for you?
Tell your girlfriend to stop bellowing.
She's like a cow being slaughtered.
Where'd you find her? Prison?
l've never heard anything like it.
Other people's happiness upsets you?
Happiness?
What happiness?
What is happiness?
Getting fucked, for example.
By a man you desire. Coming!
A woman who wails like that is faking it.
Or she's a nympho.
Enough, this is getting unpleasant.
You never let yourself go
when you get laid?
Life is noisy!
lt's no babbling brook!
l don't ''get laid'', thank heavens.
You never get laid?
Stay out of my sex life.
You've barged into mine!
No, your sex life
is bursting my eardrums!
So what are your orgasms like?
What do you do, just lie silent?
Do you even have orgasms?
l have beautiful orgasms.
- As good as yours.
- No noise?
No noise.
Middle-class orgasms?
l'm from the south!
So am l!
l'm from further south than you!
When l fuck it's bestial, it rumbles!
The earth trembles!
And your orgasm?
My orgasm...
is like a groan.
lt comes from deep within.
lt comes like this...
lt's an expression of surprise!
No need to sing opera!
Eyes rolling back!
Her eyes roll back, don't they?
l never noticed.
Pay attention next time.
See if her eyes roll back in her head.
Listen to me, Daniela.
l'm listening.
We're starting over from scratch,
and you aren't going to fake it.
Ok.
l'm not a tourist.
Ok.
Do you feel anything, for me?
Well, sure.
Love.
For my money?
Yes.
ls there anything besides my money
that you like?
Sure, lots of things.
Tell me what.
The way you take me, for example.
The respect
in your hands.
l like that.
l like being with you.
Thank you.
But don't start imagining things.
l'm not imagining anything.
You are.
You're imagining things.
What things?
You think you can change me.
l don't mind that you're a whore.
l know you're a whore.
l know you screw guys.
As long as l don't see it.
Not a bad little port.
What is it you want?
Who?
Me?
Nothing.
What do you mean nothing?
Nothing.
l'll just drink my port and leave.
May l have another?
Start talking,
we don't have a hundred years.
You're the one who should talk.
Go on.
Make me an offer.
For what?
He asks me for what!
You can't behave this way in life, pal.
Life isn't self-service.
Stealing another man's wife
is not a nice thing to do.
l consider it an attack.
l'm not happy.
l miss Daniela.
At night l look for her,
but she's not there.
Or l find someone else,
but it's no good.
Can you imagine waking up
and not finding Daniela?
The affection deficit that represents?
We need to talk damages here.
How much can you pay me in damages?
Actually, not much.
Really?
Alright.
That's a problem. A real problem.
Well, yeah.
But you see,
the woman l love is here.
l don't want to be a doormat
in front of her.
You're a nice guy.
Thank you.
l'm not a nice guy.
- Sure you are.
- No.
l'm not nice.
l'm actually a pretty nasty guy.
A real old-fashioned prick.
l have values. ln my book,
betrayal merits a death sentence.
l was once with this girl,
a kid with endless legs.
Spread Eagle, l used to call her.
She wanted to run off
with some guitarist.
Know what we did?
To who? The guitarist?
No.
To the girl.
Spare us!
- Spare us what?
- The details!
l'm talking to a future friend.
To be my friend,
he needs to know who he's dealing with.
You don't become a bastard's friend
just like that.
- You're not a bastard.
- But l am!
We did the thing with the rats.
- To who?
- Spread Eagle.
l'm begging you,
stop it, l can't stand it!
Don't tell that story!
Girls hate rats.
lt's true, they are nasty creatures.
How much are you willing to give me...
to keep Daniela?
To take my place?
How much is my pain worth?
How much do you want?
l hear you won a big lottery?
l won a big lottery.
Four million?
Did Daniela tell you?
Daniela tells me everything.
Lots of people tell me everything.
One guy even said,
''Ask him nicely for the four million,
''l'm sure he'll give it to you.''
What do l get in exchange?
Daniela.
She's yours. She's free.
l recommend her, she's excellent.
Give me a second, l need to think.
Look at me while you think.
lt'll help you.
lf l look at you, l'm sunk.
l love you too much.
Don't forget she's a whore.
l haven't forgotten.
lt's an important detail.
You two wouldn't be in this together?
You're tasting the night.
Fuck your night!
lt reeks of the sewer!
Be polite to my wife!
ls she your wife or a whore?
She's both, like in many couples.
So, what about our transaction?
l'm still thinking.
That's getting old, pal.
You know, Daniela and l...
you control our destinies.
You don't give a shit about me.
But for Daniela, it's insulting
that you prefer euros to her.
She likes euros too, the big notes!
Money is poison!
lt spoils everything, nothing's real.
Everything's calculated, make-believe.
Your friend here...
lf l give him all my money,
will you belong to me?
He'll be broke,
with nothing but his salary.
And he's no Bill Gates.
lt's not me you're buying,
it's my freedom.
My freedom is mine.
l do what l want with it.
l can trample it, soil it!
There's also a chance
she might give you her freedom.
Maybe she'll say,
''Take it, it's yours. l love you.''
We can't rule that out altogether.
l'm not interested.
ln me?
No, l love you.
But l'm keeping my money.
l'll prepare my things.
You've made a wise decision.
Congratulations.
l'm not sure l'd have had the guts
to lose such a woman.
l'm going to move to Provence.
Get a little house.
With olive trees?
With olive trees.
l love the olive tree.
What a beautiful tree.
Especially in winter,
when it becomes metallic.
Thank you. You were a real gentlemen.
Think nothing of it.
How does it feel
to be going home with your man?
lt feels good.
See? l left you alone.
l let you live your life.
l'm not a possessive man.
l don't mind being possessed by you.
No need to go overboard.
l'm a dangerous guy,
you know what l'm capable of.
You're capable of the worst.
But you get the best.
Don't you get the best?
- lt's true.
- Then say it.
- l just did.
- l put the words in your mouth.
So why am l back, in your opinion?
You always come back.
How is it you always come back?
l'm not brave enough to be free.
What's going on?
What do you mean?
l don't know.
Usually you blast off.
You're dragging.
You're on cruise control.
Don't l turn you on anymore?
Don't worry,
that's not it.
You turn me on.
Well then, have some fun!
l feel paralyzed.
lt's me, Charly.
Don't you recognize me?
l'm sorry, Charly.
This is the first time it's happened.
Yes. lt's the first time.
He ruined her for me, that asshole!
Did Mr. PC do stuff l don't do?
- He's not PC.
- They're all PC!
He makes love with his heart!
Careful, l could get steaming mad here.
Steaming mad!
Despite my love for you.
l'd rather you were tender.
l've always tried to treat you right.
But sweetness isn't my line,
l'm a bad man.
Not as bad as l was.
Thanks to you.
Your curves have softened my edges.
l'm not criticizing you.
There's fear in your eyes, is it me?
- Charly?
- Yes?
- Don't let me go.
- You want to leave me?
- l need you, Charly.
- l know you do.
Especially right now.
l need you, too.
l love you, you're my man!
You taught me everything.
Right and wrong.
Think of everything
we've been through together!
This is my room.
lt's a gangster's room.
lt's a tad virile.
Change everything if you want.
Turn it into a boudoir.
What's your boyfriend's name again?
- Francois.
- Right.
So what did Francois do to you, exactly?
l don't recognize you.
Nothing special.
Nothing special?
You spent eight days with him.
Don't tell me he did nothing!
l didn't say ''nothing''.
He touched you, didn't he?
He touched your breasts,
your ass...
He must've found a way in?
He just kind of grazed me.
Grazed you?
Sometimes it's nice to be grazed.
l'll graze you, just wait!
He gave me the best gift
a whore can receive.
What gift?
He gave me back my modesty.
Ah, indeed.
That's beautiful.
Magnificent.
l can give you back your modesty, too.
Just wait.
Come in. Come see.
My wife just got her modesty back.
Come on in.
You can't miss this. Look.
Beautiful, huh?
Not bad.
ls touching allowed?
Of course, she's my wife.
Would you like her to undress?
We might feel embarrassed.
That's the last thing l want, guys.
Did she do something wrong?
What do you think?
She did something wrong.
She met a sublime guy,
far more sublime and refined than l.
A guy who ''grazes'' women.
But it's complicated.
She's not sure she loves him.
And yet she does, but maybe not enough.
lf only you'd help me, l could!
- Could what?
- Love him!
You want me to help you love him?
Try to understand,
instead of playing Godfather!
Can't you see l'm losing it?
Beat it, guys.
She's about to start bawling.
With her newfound modesty,
she'll be embarrassed.
Listen little lady,
go if you want to,
but make it quick.
Pain mustn't be drawn out.
You gotta rip off the bandage
all at once.
Bite the bullet and it's done.
Go on.
Be a good girl, hurry up.
You've got an opening,
you should take it.
l'm feeling generous, but it won't last.
Shit! l love you enough to let you go!
Do you realize how much love that is?
Hello.
What is it?
What is it?
Excuse me, Monsieur...
l'm busy fucking!
l'm well aware of that.
We're just being neighborly.
We both had the blues.
Feeling better?
Oh yes, definitely.
Do you mind us feeling better?
Well, he's my boyfriend.
l have to finish,
l can't leave her like this.
l won't be long.
He's all yours in 15 minutes.
Here you go.
l've brought him back to you.
Thank you for your patience.
l'd love to have kept him longer,
but l thought that might be pushing it.
See you again, maybe.
You never know.
The thing is, it might be difficult now.
Sure, l understand.
l understand.
lf ever you don't know
what to do with him, l'm here.
Thanks, how sweet of you.
Even at the last minute.
l'm almost always home.
l think l'll do the same.
What, stay home?
As often as possible.
Shit!
Don't give me that look!
This is your fault.
l don't know if you're coming or going,
so l came with the neighbor!
Go take a shower right now.
Change your tone of voice, please.
Be nice, Francois!
l don't want the scent
of another woman on you.
l'm telling you l love you,
help me out!
Don't be afraid, darling.
We'll be happy together, you'll see.
You think so?
l know so.
Even when your money runs out?
l never had any money.
Just my salary.
What about the lottery?
You made it up?
Of course l did.
Bastard!
You bastard!
You fucked me over?
Kind of.
You dared fuck me over?
You think you can fuck me over?
Sure.
You can't!
You haven't won yet, sweetheart!
You haven't won.
Sure l have.
You know very well l have. Look!
You're starting to melt.
l'm getting closer to you.
Look, l'm taking you in my arms.
Of course l've won.
You bastard...
Oh, it's you. Hello.
What's going on?
We've been worried.
What about?
You haven't been to the office
in two weeks.
Oh, you know, the office...
We thought you might be sick.
No, l'm just fine.
Are you depressed?
No, not at all.
You're pale, you've lost weight,
you look exhausted.
ls it because you're screwing
all the time?
l'll explain later...
You can't close the door,
my foot's in it.
So, your lady love came back?
Let your friend in.
Where are your manners?
We have nothing to hide.
You French are so inhospitable.
Come in.
My name is Daniela.
l'm Michael. l work with Francois.
What would you like?
Whiskey, white wine?
The thing is...
l'm not alone.
What do you mean?
l'm with friends.
Friends? What friends?
They were worried.
We'll toast your happiness!
So, is the beauty here?
Careful, this is gonna hurt.
What did l tell you?
What a beautiful woman.
l'd do anything for a woman like her.
l'd pray all day.
You see why l've neglected the office.
What a beautiful woman,
and what pain l feel that she's not mine,
l'll never possess her.
Why never?
There is no never with women.
She's the wife of a friend.
Don't forget she's a whore.
l fucked her.
She works in a bar in Pigalle.
Who gives a shit?
She's beautiful, period.
That she is.
But it is upsetting.
- What's upsetting?
- That she's a whore.
Why is that upsetting?
Because she's my wife.
- What's the problem?
- You should be thrilled.
Thrilled about what?
Living with a whore!
Having a whore you can fuck anytime.
Who doesn't put on airs.
Are you fighting over me?
Not at all!
Did someone call me a whore?
Not at all!
- l am a whore!
- Of course you are!
How l love you
for having friends like this!
How l love your life!
What a beautiful woman.
May l come in for a while?
What for?
To watch you all dance.
You seem to be having so much fun.
l won't bother you.
l'll just sit in a corner.
Are you a relative?
Distant.
l lived with a woman, and she left me.
l miss her.
What a beautiful woman!
There's no point crying, pal.
You mustn't cry.
lf there's no point crying,
there's no point living either!
What's the point of life?
Who's that girl watching us?
Where?
Over there, across the way,
are you blind or what?
What's under your pants?
A thong.
- And under your tight sweater?
- A push-up bra.
- And in your head?
- Turmoil!
What do you mean by turmoil?
No touching my ass while talking!
- l didn't.
- Someone did.
Who touched her ass?
Nobody!
l can always go back home.
- Back to my solitude.
- No, stay with us!
Why should l?
l always meet bastards.
Asses are meant to be touched,
this is Francoise.
You can always leave Francoise.
You have to ask permission.
Permission for what?
A woman is not an apple cart.
l could blow you all away right now!
There's evil in me!
Will you shut your fucking traps!
May l remind you this is my home!
And my wife's home, too.
We want to go to bed!
At seven p.m.?
We're way behind on our lovemaking.
You're asking us to leave?
You could say that.
No, please stay!
l'm the mistress of the house.
Did you hear how she said that?
What a kind, tactful woman!
l'm just happy, that's all.
Alright already,
we know you're happy!
We get it, for chrissakes!
Fuck!
Too much happiness, too much!
Beware of parties,
they often end in tears.
- This one won't.
- How do you know?
l'm keeping an eye on things.
lt's a wonderful party.
Let's go, come on.
The first one who fucks up
gets a bullet!
- Where did she go?
- Who?
Daniela.
She was just here.
- She's gone now!
- Maybe she left.
With who?
Some other guy, no doubt.
Daniela.
l've had enough,
more than enough!
lt's called pollution!
Noise pollution!
l know it's wrong,
but l couldn't resist.
l usually resist, but look at her!
Sorry to meddle,
but she is a whore.
He's not even reacting.
Hey, Francois! Hello?
Leave him alone.
He's taking his punishment.
ln life there are no referees.
l could have done it.
lf l'd wanted to.
By the way, how's your heart?
l haven't heard about it in a while.
My heart?
lt's all better.
Since l met you.
