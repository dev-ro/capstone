THE CITY OF OSAKA
How thorough
- Let me see that
- This?
Doesn't this eye look smaller today?
It looks the same to me
Does it?
Such an expensive gift
I bought it myself
Here he is!
- Welcome
- Hi
Hello
You came alone?
She'll be here around seven
I'll have whisky on the rocks
Certainly
She had to deliver a painting
I see
You praised her highly...
...but do you know my taste?
Of course
Your late wife was pretty
and this spring at Arima...
You mustn't mention such things
There's just one drawback
What's that?
She has a son
by her late husband
Fine. I have children, too
What was his business?
A university professor
A professor, eh
Not a sake brewer's son?
She dislikes her family's business
So she's the widow of a scholar
She should be here
Perhaps I shouldn't be here
Perhaps not
I'll act as though I came in...
...and met you by chance
- Where will you go?
- Over there
Isn't it better?
Isomura-san
Signal me if you like her
OK, I'll rub my nose
Here you go
Here
- Where's he going?
- Well...
What is the sign?
We were talking about baseball
Hello. Here
Welcome
- Sorry I'm late
- Never mind. Sit down
Do you want a drink?
No thanks
Later then
Please make yourself at home
Thank you for coming here
Not at all. What did you want?
I hadn't seen you for a while...
...and wondered how things were going
Hello
Oh, it's you, Kitagawa
It's been a long time
We last met at the Rokko Golf Link
- Please sit down
- No, no...
Please join us
For a little while then
Who's this?
My wife's niece
Oh, yes, I've heard about
the Kohayagawa family
I work at my friend's art gallery
I see, that's fine
This is my business card
I operate a small steel mill
I'm deeply obliged to him
Is that so
You have a nice job
Yes, it is, but...
Have you any paintings of an ox?
Pardon?
You know, an ox
I collect things concerning the ox
This is also an ox
I'd like to have a painting of an ox
A Japanese style painting, or...
Well? Shall I leave it to her?
Why not
I'll leave it to you
I'll look for one
Noriko maybe visiting me today
I'll telephone
- Where's the telephone?
- That way
- Well?
- OK, she's OK
That's fine
A big OK
You truly knew my taste.
She's the right age, too
Arrange everything, will you
Let's dine out later.
Anyway, let's have a drink
Excuse me
Is Gin Fizz all right?
Three Gin Fizzes, please
OK, OK. A big OK
That's wonderful
Let's toast to this occasion
A toast
I am home
- Hi
- Hi
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
I hurried home.
I turned down an invitation
Isn't this wrong? Think again
Isn't it like this?
Then this is wrong
Think hard
What is it? What did you want
to discuss with me?
They want me to have
a marriage interview
Again? How popular
It isn't like the last time
This time it's serious.
Even Sister urges me
Oh? Who is he?
A man whose father
is the president of a bank...
...but he works for a beer company
It sounds good
Don't treat it so lightly.
I'm perplexed
About what?
I haven't even considered
marriage yet
Perhaps not, but you can't evade it
Why not just meet the man?
But...
You can reject him
Neither Father nor Fumiko
will force you to marry him
I wonder
Of course
Business seems to be poor nowadays
Father wants me to marry the man
Is that so?
Oh, I must be leaving
Is it that late? It is
You can make it if you hurry
I'll come again
- Advise me again, Sister
- Come anytime
Oh, I bought some cakes
I'll have some next time
- Goodbye, Minoru
- Goodbye
You'd better hurry
I will. Goodbye
Take care
Goodbye
Okaden is finally merging
with Katsura Masamune Co
Is that so?
I've heard rumours, but who told you?
Do you know Kaneko who works there?
Yes, I know him
He mentioned it when I saw him
So, I treated him to drinks
to learn the details
Yes, he's here
It's your wife
All right
Have you got any response
from Yamagishi?
- Not yet
- Right
Hello
Yes, it's me
What is it?
My uncle's here from Osaka
Can you come home?
We'll be waiting
He'll return immediately
I see
How does the other party feel?
He saw her a few days ago
and is enthusiastic
Is that so. How about Akiko?
I haven't told her about it yet
You mean she had an interview
without knowing it?
That's right
How reckless
You think Akiko
might get to like him?
I think he's OK
What do you think?
Well, I hope Sister likes him
The only thing is that
he isn't a scholar...
...like her late husband
He runs a steel mill
That may not bother my sister
Yes, it's up to her
He's back
Welcome
How are you?
Hello, it's been a long time
Yanosuke proposes matrimony for Akiko
Is that so?
I personally think it's a good match
I see
It would be ideal...
...if both Noriko and Akiko
were engaged
Yes
Find out how she feels about marriage
Why don't you?
I'll persuade her, too...
...but please, talk to her
Where are you going?
I just remembered...
Going out? I'll leave, too
No, you make yourself comfortable
Father is kept busy
I don't know,
he goes out a lot lately
Yes, but it's good to see him healthy
Has Noriko's interview day
been fixed?
Yes, at the New Osaka Hotel
I see, that's fine. It's well suited
It's another hot day
Yes. Yes. Where?
From six? I'll go
Yes, I'll ask her
Are you free tonight?
Yes, why?
Teramoto-san is to leave
in a few days
For Sapporo?
Yes, so we're holding
a party tonight
I see. So he finally decided
Yes
Is that so?
So he's going...
- Best wishes
- Cheers
- Good luck
- To your health
Thank you
- I admire your decision
- You'll get a pay rise?
A little
A lecturer's pay
is shockingly low
Won't you be
an assistant professor?
It's small just the same
I wish you would all come up to ski
I'd like to,
but the train fare is high
We'll cherish your memory
on Mountain Ibuki
Thus. How grows the mugwort
of Ibuki...
Truly I feel this burning passion
It's too late to flirt with him now
That was fun
After being with them I hate to leave
Will you be gone for long?
I'm told four or five years,
but who knows?
Please visit me if you can
Yes
Be sure to
Yes
It was fun tonight. I enjoyed it
I'll write to you.
Please answer my letter
Yes
Promise now
I enjoyed tonight.
I hate to leave now
Add the following...
What do they add up to?
33,455 yen
And you?
- The same
- How much?
33,455 yen
33,455 yen
That's too bad
It can't be helped
Small enterprises can't compete
- Is that so?
- Let me see
- The last one?
- No, the one before
This is it
Hello. Hot, isn't it?
Where's Hisao?
He went out a while ago
- Where to?
- Masamune Winery
I see. I'll step out, too
Goodbye
The Old Master goes out often
Yes, I wonder where he goes?
Hey...
- Yes?
- A little word
It's strange how he goes out
so often lately
His family is worried
Will you go and...
- To see them?
- No, follow him
From now?
Yes, trail him
and see where he goes
Hey, Roku-san!
Oh, Old Master
Where are you going?
Come...
Sit down
Sit down
Thank you. Excuse me
What will you have?
Anything is fine
How about iced dumplings?
That's fine
Another Shiratama. Please
What a strange place to meet
Yes, I'm bill collecting
Thanks for working hard
My, it's warm today
Yes, the heat of late summer
is severe this year
Where are you going, sir?
Where are you collecting?
Around here
- Say...
- Yes?
Have you got a cigarette?
- Yes, sir
- Give me one
Please
Peace brand, eh
How extravagant
I'm sorry
- Look...
- Yes?
I'm aware of it
What?
Never mind
- Tell me
- Yes?
The Young Master orders you?
No, absolutely not
I see
Who asked you to make
the collections, then?
Oh, bill collecting?
I do it on my own
I see. That's commendable
Isn't it ready yet?
This man is busy.
He must go bill collecting. Hurry
Right away, sir
You're a hard worker
Hello. Hello?
Well, hello
You walked in this heat
Please come in
Thank you, may I?
Please come in
It's so hot every day
Yes, isn't it
Is your brewery busy?
It's the slowest time of the year
Without new rice, there's no work
I had an amusing experience
Oh, what?
Our clerk followed me
Why did he do that?
I've been coming here often
My family members are worried
How absurd
I called this clerk who trailed me
into a tea room
I asked him for a cigarette
He got excited and paid for
the ice dumplings. The fool
Is that so? You were lucky
Want sugar in your barley tea?
Never mind, thanks
It's strange, fate
What is?
We wouldn't have met that day
if I had taken the first tram
That's right.
We were fated to meet
Yes, fate is strange.
We hadn't seen each other in 19 years
And to meet at such a place
We've both changed
We met after the bicycle race
Life changes like running water
Our world has really changed
It's disgusting
I miss the old days
Remember that tea shop?
You mean Hanayashiki.
We went there often
You took us on long excursions.
It was such fun
Yes, those viewings of snow scenery
and that firefly chase
Do you remember that moonlit night?
Of course. You changed me
from a girl into a woman
It was a long time ago
Yes
Yuriko is 21 already
How time flies.
Let's go to Uji one of these days
Yes, let's do that. Take me there
- Shall I prepare sake?
- Thank you
Hello
Hello
Your father's here
Really?
Hello
Hello. When did you come?
Sit down
I must leave right away.
Please stay longer
You're going out again?
Yeah. Goodbye. Bye-bye
Goodbye
When will you buy me a mink stole?
You mean this? It's too warm yet
Yes, but I must ask you now
I understand
Such a restless girl
Oh, hello. It's nice to see you
Hello
Yuriko, George is waiting for you
Hurry
I'll be going, Mother
Come home early
Who is he?
An American with a company in Kobe
She has such friends?
Yes, she's a typist
She receives exotic presents
sometimes
Oh? Is it safe for her?
Girls nowadays are different
They can take care of themselves
Try some of this black stuff
What is it?
Yuriko received it
She says they're shark eggs
Shark eggs, eh?
The eggs are small for a shark
Yes. Take it home if you like
We have another can
I see
It's delicious
- Have a drink
- Thank you
What did you do?
I was shrewd.
I managed to trail the Old Master
Where did he go?
It was an inn called Sasaki
- Sasaki?
- You know the place?
Go on, what was the woman like?
Slender and about 44 or 45
No, she must be about 47 or 48
- You know her?
- Never mind
I thought they had cut
their ties during the war
Tell me more
Do they have a daughter
between them?
Daughter?
- Around 21?
- No
She called Old Master father
No, only he believes it.
What happened next?
30 minutes later, I heard
the strumming of a lute
He was singing a Nagauta
No, no
That was a Hauta
Like this?
That's it
I know
He sings only that
- What is she? A Geisha?
- No, no
- From Minami?
- No, no. She's his old flame
Old flame?
The Old Master led a fast life
He troubled his folks over her
Is that so?
Things will be complicated again.
What a headache
Here are your clothes
Thank you
Hello
What do you want?
Yamayoshi's postcard
Here it is
Father is at it again.
She lives in Kyoto, I hear
Where in Kyoto?
Her name is Sasaki
- Sasaki?
- Sasaki Tsune
Oh...
Then it's that woman Father kept
in Osaka long ago
Yes, I think so
I was just a child then
She often brought Father home
at night
Mother wept frequently
Yes, she must be Father's old flame
It's deplorable,
the way he acts at his age
He's ignoring our winery business
I would rather have him interested
in bicycle racing
We have one worry after another
You must not rebuke him too severely
Why not?
Not now.
Wait for a better opportunity
No, I'll tell him!
No. After all, he's an old man
Then he should act like one
It's just his character
Character?
You mean he can do
as he pleases then?
Of course not...
...but you can't change
his character now
I'll change it for him
Don't try. Suppose he rebels?
Such a good bath
I thought about it...
...while I was taking my bath...
...about Mother's
memorial service
Let's make a brief visit
to her grave...
...and lunch at Arashiyama
Yes, that would be good
Mother liked Arashiyama. Well?
You mean in Kyoto?
Naturally
She liked it,
but you like Kyoto, too, don't you?
What?
Does something attractive there
make you go often?
What?
- Wait...
- Be quiet!
- But then...
- Be quiet!
Do you intend to repeat
your sinful past behaviour?
What are you talking about?
We know everything
Know what?
What's wrong with holding
a service in Arashiyama?
Which Arashiyama...
Look at me!
You two suspect me, don't you?
No, nothing of the sort
What's the idea having
Rokutaro follow me?
Are you doing something shady?
What!
I go to Kyoto
to consult an old friend...
...about our business
The idea!
Who is this old friend?
Is the name Sasaki?
No! It's Yamada.
You should know him!
I don't know him
That's too bad
I've been asking his help
I can't leave it up to you people
- Well, then...
- Forget it
I will not. Be quiet!
- Father!
- What?
Are you really worried
about the business?
- Of course!
- Then why not go again today?
- What?
- Hurry, get ready
Not today
I just saw him yesterday
No! Quicker the better
Please go to see him again today
Not today
I've taken a bath
I'll prepare it again
Please, Father
Please go and seek his help
Do you suspect me to that extent?
I'll go, then!
If you suspect me so...
...have Roku follow me!
How insulting!
You mistrust your own father!
I'm going!
Have someone follow me
Find out where I go!
I'm going. Follow me
See where I go!
You fools!
Will he be all right?
Don't worry. He has no money
He'll walk around and return
I see
Then, it's all right
lt'll be good exercise
You're in the way
Mother, is he really my father?
Why?
Didn't I have another father...
...when I was a little girl?
I recall I used
to call him Father, too
Did you?
Perhaps you did
Who's my real father?
What difference does it make?
It's up to you
Don't you know either?
It isn't that it matters
It's a fact I was born
I'm this big already
That's right. Think of it that way
- Hey...
- What?
Is my present father rich?
I imagine so. He owns a brewery
I see. He hasn't bought
that mink stole yet
Ask him again
It's the way you ask
I see
I'll consider him as my father
when he buys that stole
Yes, do that
I'm here. Here I am again
Well, hello
- Hello, Father
- Hi
- Scrubbing the floor?
- Yes
You're home today!
- Let me do it
- You needn't
Don't worry, I'm one of the family
You must take off your tabi
Yes, you're quite observant
I forgot my wallet
and was embarrassed
The tobacco shop lent me 1,000 yen
Care for some iced dumplings?
I don't care about dumplings
Buy that mink stole for me
Yes, I'll buy it
You're good at cleaning
Hello. Good afternoon
Hello
I'm sorry about the other night
No, no problem
Have you found a painting of an ox?
I'm still looking for one
Isn't he an amusing man?
Yes
He's quite amusing
Has Fumiko talked to you about him?
Yes...
I see. How do you feel?
It's so sudden
I would like to think it over
Naturally.
Please think about it carefully
Your father's worried about you
I'm sorry. I worry everyone
Not at all
How about seeing him again
somewhere?
He would like to see you. Well?
He was really disappointed
you left us that night
I heard your mother's memorial
service will be held at Arashiyama
So it seems
Will you go?
Arashiyama should be beautiful
at this time
ARASHIYAMA
Hand me that
- How about some?
- No thanks
You don't drink much
Beer fills me up quickly
Moss grows unusually fast,
doesn't it, Brother
Moss?
The gravestone was covered with moss
Yes, so it was
Moss grows faster than they describe
Yes, time flies
It's been six years
since Akiko became a widow
Where's Akiko?
She left with Noriko
I see
The other party is keen about Akiko
He has two children,
a girl and a boy
He welcomes Akiko's child
That's fine. How does it sound?
I think it's a good match...
...but it all depends
on how she feels
Yes, but she can't wait forever
Akiko has a long time to live yet
She can't go on living by herself.
It's pitiful
Yes, but...
How does Noriko feel?
She's already had her interview
Have you asked her, Fumiko?
Yes, I asked her, but...
What did she say?
She's quite confused
She isn't definite
I see
She should decide right away
I think...
...it's a fine match
So do I, but she says
we mustn't rush things
It should be rushed,
don't you think?
Quicker the better, eh Brother?
Well, that would be ideal
Too many of us are captains
of the boat
We must consider her feelings
Don't you have other business
in Kyoto, Father?
What?
- Want another?
- Thank you
Akiko and Noriko are down there
Is that right. And what did he do?
He ate everything that was offered...
...and later loosened his belt
Such a big eater
He must have been famished
Perhaps...
...but when we took a stroll
after the hotel dinner...
You two were left alone?
Yes, they urged us to take a walk
And what happened?
He asked me whether
I disliked western food
His answer to the same question
was that he disliked it...
...after all he ate
Such a funny man
He sounds amusing. Then what?
When we reached a deserted spot,
he squeezed my hand
What did you do?
- I squeezed his back
- And then?
He said my hand was cold...
...and wouldn't let go
He tried to release his hand
when people were near
So, I purposely held his hand
And then?
You make me do all the talking
How about yourself?
What?
Uncle's proposal
Oh, that.
An old woman like me...
100 yen, please
What?
You promised to pay 100 yen...
...each time you said old woman
Oh, yes
- Here's 100 yen
- Thanks
Be careful, Masao
Minoru! You must look after him
How do you feel about the proposal?
Oh, me...
I haven't said it yet
I was a little hasty
What nice weather
What an enjoyable day
Going out together like that is nice
- Let's go more often
- Yes, you're right
We've had lovely weather
It was really wonderful...
...wasn't it?
Yes, but I felt a bit sorry
for father
Why?
We went as far as Kyoto,
and yet...
That again. You're hopeless
Why not go to bed, Father?
I think I will
It's a good time for that
Look after him, Nori-chan
Goodnight
You shouldn't say such things
Yes, I should.
I haven't said enough
I think I'll be leaving
It's early yet
Yes, but...
Minoru, we must leave
We're leaving
You needn't go yet
Yes, but...
- It's Father...
- What?
He fell in a faint!
Father!
- Father!
- Father!
Father!
Call the doctor!
Father...
Hello. 30-1051 please
Hello? 30-1051 please
HIRAYAMA CLINIC
How is he?
He'll be all right
if he doesn't have another attack
But his age...
Oh, Aunt
What happened?
What's wrong?
He was feeling fine
After we returned, he suddenly...
And how is he?
It's his heart
If no change occurs until dawn,
he'll live
Have you notified everyone?
Yes, I've sent telegrams
I see. We'll go and see him
My, it's sudden
Yes, I was really shocked
Was the Old Master's heart bad?
No, he had a bad liver
Who's the gentleman that arrived?
He's the younger brother
- From Nagoya?
- No, he's from Tokyo
The woman is the one from Nagoya.
She's his younger sister
Of the Osaka gentleman?
No. Now try to remember
The Osaka gentleman's wife
and the Nagoya sister are...
No, no, I'm wrong
The Osaka gentleman's wife
is the Old Master's...
The Old Master is an adopted son.
She's his wife's sister
I see. It's very complex
The Kohayagawa family is involved
You must be tired.
Shall I lay out your bedding?
No, never mind. How about you?
No thanks
Why not rest for a while?
The train ride must have been tiring
No, I'm all right
Have you been busy lately?
Yes, rather
And you?
I'm busy as usual
How is he?
He's resting quietly
That's fine
He must get well
It's hard on you, isn't it?
It's a critical time
Yes, he must somehow get well
No attack has occurred
He must have passed the danger point
Yes
I hope so
It's five already
If he's going to live,
I want to return to Nagoya
I left some unfinished business
I'd like to go back, too
Are you busy?
Yes, a stockholders' meeting
is scheduled
- You, too?
- Yes
It's not imperative I go...
...but I'm having a new plant built
I wish you would both stay then
Anything could happen
Yes, it's better if you both stay
You can't tell...
What's wrong?
What happened?
Oh, Father!
Father
What's wrong?
Are you all right?
Oh, I slept well.
I must relieve myself
What happened?
Is he all right?
I stopped him, but...
I'm glad...
I'm so glad he's well
So glad
Father has recovered his health
Indeed
It seems like it was a dream
You don't throw good balls
This one will be good
- Where's Minoru-chan?
- Out hiking
- Where to?
- Rokko Mountain
I'd like to go. It's Sunday
I was invited...
...but they were all children
and someone like me...
- What?
- 100 yen
I didn't say it
You're unfair
Shall I help?
I'm finished
Pass me that, Sister
This one?
Hisao-san is busy on Sundays, too?
Yes, with this and that
It's difficult running
a small company
Father's against a merger, but...
It must be difficult
I guess we'll succumb eventually
You can't win over big capital
Father would like
to continue as now...
...but it's doubtful
Oh, that was wonderful exercise
You've recovered completely
I've caused you all lots of anxiety
I'm all right now.
Look how strong I am
Father...
What?
- I must apologise to you
- For what?
I said such spiteful things
I don't mind
I'm used to it
That hurts me...
...but it would have been unbearable
if you had died
Nonsense. I won't die so easily
I have many things
on my mind...
...about you and Noriko
I'm sorry to worry you
Are you undecided?
Will you sew this?
The seam is torn
- Tired, Grandad?
- Not at all
Let's play hide-and-seek
Hide-and-seek? Wait a moment
Hurry up!
Now, wait
Hurry up!
Am I a bother?
What are you doing?
Writing a letter
To whom?
Just someone
I know
What?
It's to him
That heavy eater
No
Any new developments?
No, nothing new.
I must give an answer soon
What will you answer?
I haven't any reason to reject him
Then marry him
It's easy for you to say
But why?
He seems like a nice man
If I married him...
...the family would,
of course, be relieved, but...
...it isn't so simple
Do you love someone else?
You do. I thought so
Who is he?
What's he doing?
Remember when I went skiing
last winter?
You met him then?
Is he the one
we met at the department store?
Is he the one?
You see him often?
No, he's in Sapporo at present
Sapporo?
My, he's gone far away
The letter is to him, then?
Just a reply
- I wonder...
- No
Just a reply
I don't know how Father
and the others feel...
...but you mustn't regret
your choice
After all, it's your life
That's just the way I feel
Well, anyone would waver
Did you also?
I was happy. I never regretted it
I'm still happy,
although people feel sorry for me
You plan to remain single, then?
I've been wondering...
...whether I can keep it up
You're the devil
Again?
I'm tired. Let's stop, shall we?
That's unfair
I just remembered some business
No, you must close your eyes
Now, this is the last time
No peeking
You must not look!
I won't
Face that way
What are you doing?
Playing hide-and-seek
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Come and find me
Are you ready?
Come and find me
Are you ready?
Come and find me
Are you ready?
Come and find me
Are you ready?
Come and find me
Are you ready?
Come and find me
Come and find me
Come and find me
I don't know how young people
feel nowadays, but...
Isn't it hard to live
with an overly virtuous man?
The way I feel, for example...
...I can take a man who was wild
as a bachelor...
...but not a man with bad traits
Traits can't be corrected
You're right
What is it?
- Where's Grandad?
- I don't know
Didn't he come here?
What are you doing?
Playing hide-and-seek
Didn't he come here?
- I wonder where he's gone
- Right...
It's Grandad!
He's walking over there!
Too bad. We should have bet on both
Yes. I thought it would be
bike number three and two
It can't be helped
Let's not be gloomy
Let's go to Osaka and eat.
You like noodles?
No, let's go home and relax
Let's go to Osaka!
To Osaka!
She's so late
Yes, she is
Now, look here...
I wonder why...
That's what I want to ask you
What's wrong?
I wonder what's wrong?
She said she'd try to come
Try to?
Why didn't you say so sooner?
You're being quite irresponsible
Don't you think so!
You brought this proposal
to me. Right?
- Well, yes...
- Then show more responsibility
If this is the result,
I shouldn't have met her
Why did you introduce her to me?
When a man falls in love
at first sight...
When a man falls in love
at first sight, it's serious
Right?
Is what I'm saying unreasonable
or wrong?
Oh, I'm disgusted!
Let's drink elsewhere
She said she found a painting
of an ox. Wait a little more
We've already waited for two hours!
Painting be damned! Let's go
Just one more drink...
No, thanks. I'm full of liquid
You'll tell me now she'll try to come
She won't come
I'm disgusted!
Oh, well, it's good to see him
so healthy
Yes, it's good...
...but he ought to tell me
he's going out
Yes...
...after making us worry so much,
but he's so easy-going
And just this morning he said
he'd gone to the brink of hell
Telephone...
Hello. Yes, it is
Yes. Yes
What?
We'll be right over
Nori-chan!
Who was it?
- Father is ill
- Who called?
Sasaki in Kyoto
Wants us right over...
a girl's voice
What's wrong?
I don't know,
but Father has collapsed again
That's awful
- We must go immediately
- What is it?
Father's ill again. Go with him
Let's go
They're taking so long
They should be here by now
Yes
But I lost out
What?
There goes my mink stole
I should have got it sooner
I saw a lovely one at Kawaramachi
Get George to buy it for you
He can only afford
a handbag at the most
They're here
Good evening
It's George
No, not George. It's Harry
I'm going
Come home early tonight...
...even though you've got a date
I'll be back early
I'll be going, Mother
Oh, what a terrible day
We shouldn't have gone there
It wasn't such a good day
as you thought
How unlucky
And it was so hot...
Good evening
Good evening
Good evening
I'm Kohayagawa
Oh, please come in
How is he?
Please...
It happened so suddenly
It was 8:23
He looks peaceful
What time was it...
He came and we went out together
He wanted to go to Osaka,
but I made him return
While I was washing my hands,
he sat here
Suddenly he looked ill
and held his chest
I see
I called a doctor right away...
...but it was too late
I see
He suffered terribly
Is that right?
Did he express any dying wishes?
He merely repeated twice:
"So this is the end"
I see
It happened so quickly
Life is so fleeting, isn't it?
Aren't there a lot of crows today?
Yes, there are
Someone must have died
Perhaps
But no smoke is rising
from the crematorium chimney
You're right
You must be tired
No, not very
Such problems you have
Yes
What about the company?
I'm thinking about it.
It's given me headaches
Will you merge?
I suppose we will
Too bad
Father was worried about it
lt'll be better
if a big company takes over...
...and I get a job there
A salaried man, eh?
Well, I suppose...
I thought Father
was undependable...
...but the House of Kohayagawa
was preserved...
...because of him
Poor Hisao
I'd hope things wouldn't change...
...until after you got married
I thought it over all night long
I think it's best
that I do what I desire
What do you mean?
Now that Father's dead...
...I should marry
the man arranged for me
But I'd be dissatisfied
It might help
the Kohayagawa family...
...but if I don't listen
to my feelings...
...no doubt I'll regret it later
I don't know what to do
What will you do?
I think...
Yes?
I'll go to Sapporo
I see
I personally thought
that would be the best
Do you really think so?
Yes
You're young.
You must have a happy life
You check the day?
Have you taken care
of the obituary notice?
It'll be in the papers
Then, that's taken care of
Oh, lunch for the guests
I've arranged that. What about cars?
Unnecessary.
It's just across the river
It's close. Let them walk
Eight people?
No, nine
Oh, it's the lady from Nagoya...
Hello. Please, over there
Thanks for your trouble
Aunt...
Please
What a shock
What happened? So sudden!
His heart?
Yes, it happened suddenly
It's better than being an invalid
Yes
Did he say anything before he died?
He just repeated the words:
"So this is the end"
Is that all?
Yes
So easy-going
That's all he says
after doing what he pleases
How selfish
I guess he wanted to live longer
He was greedy
I heard about that
Oh, hello
Hello
It seems man is not enlightened
even at the time of death
Even a libertine like my brother
Even the great Taiko...
...had much misgiving
at the moment of death
Yes, how true
Where's your uncle from Tokyo?
He isn't here yet
I see. He must be busy
My brother should have died
when we were all here
the last time
He always did as he pleased
He sold the family heirlooms...
...and he was
an incorrigible sinner...
...but such a fortunate man
But now that he's dead...
...it's all over
Hey, someone died after all
Smoke is rising
Yes, so it is
It's pitiful
if it's a young person...
...instead of someone old
Yes, but new lives...
...successively replace those
that die
Yes
How well nature works
lt'll be lonely with you gone
After I go to Sapporo...
...please come to visit me
Yes, I will come
But it's so far
What do you plan to do?
Me?
I'll just continue my present life
Minoru is growing up...
...and I think it'll be best for him
That's just like you
I don't know about that
Let's go
We mustn't be late
THE END
