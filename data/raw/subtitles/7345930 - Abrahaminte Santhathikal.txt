Reach at 7 AM sharp in the morning.
You've just started, huh?
I'll go take a bath and come!
Don't touch!
S.l. Joseph and his child succumbed
to death with just one strike.
Just like what we found
during the previous murder...,
He leads me beside
peaceful waters.
God commands Abraham to offer
his son Isaac as a sacrifice.
Let the one who does right
continue to do right;
I mean, tea, coffee, juice, soft
drinks or something like that?
To be frank, I consider myself lucky
to assist someone like you, sir.
and existing contradictions.
I'm silent, because I
have the responsibility!
Show some more responsibility!
Can't get through to him.
Johnny sir is a workaholic.
But you always keep ignoring them!
He'll just keep going around.
He won't shoot him.
You...
they're planning to hand over
this case to some big shot.
'By then, the killer would kill
everyone and finish his job'.
They're trying to bring someone
smarter, by humiliating us.
This is the problem. How is this
guy going to come up in life?
You go & find out if it's true!
If you're his fan, go and
blow trumpets for him!
I can see him with my own eyes.
If God performs a miracle,
you would recognize me.
There, near the hall,
the Satan's box is placed.
The Lord is showing me that an
X-Ray certificate is kept there.
Killer, stop your miracles right now.
and let the holy person
continue to be holy.
I caught him from the
junction next to the crime scene.
Where is Johnny?
- I don't know.
There is no sin in Him.
And how are you going to
source such a huge amount?
You can never release the child by sourcing
such a huge amount, within the given time.
Let's request them to
reduce the amount.
No.
The Nigerian.
But sir...
Derrick Abraham.
Where is he?
Have you seen the English
movie 'Training Day'?
3 people each were killed
during the two incidents.
The bloodstains used to jot down
the numbers are AB Negative.
While we're investigating a case,
I can't talk about my family, right?
I have some concepts about
the woman I want to marry.
Based on the letters, the killer also
belongs to a Christian background.
- Aren't you a Christian?
- Yes.
We had told this to the officer
who came before you too.
I can understand
what you're asking.
' Oh Redeemer of the weak'
' At the city of Betlehem '
' As a candle that lights up in darkness '
' Oh Redeemer of the weak'
' At the city of Betlehem '
' Oh Lamp of Love '
' Teach us Your wise words '
' As we tread the difficult
paths of Golgotha hill '
' The merciful Shepherd who came
to absolve us of our sins '
' Oh Jesus '
' Oh Jesus '
Come to Me, all those
toiling and being burdened,
and no one knows the
Father except the Son,
Religions and Revelations can
be construed in many ways!
It's said in the Bible, right Father?
Sir, did you find any clue about the
culprit, or the motive for the murders?
No more murders will happen.
.. a new age Abraham who
received the Revelation of God,
We couldn't find any provocation
like some vendetta,
10 year old Amelia didn't
participate in prayers in school.
A kind of self-imposed ostracization.
When I checked the admission register,
I found that all those
who were murdered,
None of their houses had
prayer rooms or crucifixes,
and killed by an extreme
believer or a blind believer.
A kind of delusion that he's the
incarnate of God, chosen by God himself.
There was a guy in California
long back - Charles Manson.
There will be such killers who go crazy
with faith all around the world.
We need to find out why he's
targeting ten people precisely.
Sniffer dogs won't reach
anywhere, sniffing for clues.
I need informations of all the people who
have proclaimed themselves as atheists,
If we find out who that is,
we can nab the killer easily.
The Revelation you
received was not from God.
were atheists or non-believers!
All my actions were deliberate,
while I was fully in my senses.
they insulted God.
Glory be to Jesus.
I will complete my sacrifice.
You are answerable, sir.
- You owe us an explanation.
As the Government and Home Ministry
are under tremendous pressure,
Your brother is here.
He is no one to me!
Consider this is as a payback
for whatever you've done.
- Yes. Come.
- Yeah.
Even if I wish for it really badly,
my brother won't take bribes.
I shouldn't have asked!
Who's that girl?
And, what did you tell Philip?
Sit down.
Does your family know that
you both are going out?
- For whom?
- Both of us.
You really love Philip, right?
' The glint of your smile,
like jasmine petals '
' Your sweet words are like the
fresh drops of rain '
' There's a desire in our mind,
to become one '
' I'm lovelorn, like a
broken piece of a cloud '
' Oh my beauty '
' Oh my beauty '
' Oh my beauty '
' Rain or sunshine?
I didn't bother '
' I gave you my heart '
' Are your eyes dancing
within my heart? '
' Where did you go,
without listening to me? '
' Don't go away from me '
' Oh my beauty '
- Yes, sir.
- Derrick...
- What happened?
- I don't know anything.
Come.
lchaya!
Hey! Leave him!
I must take your son
into custody, sir.
Derrick, please!
Your kids' friends circle
is dangerous, sir.
From the time we came to know,
his mother is really depressed.
Exempt both of them from this.
Oh dear!
My son!
Forging fake ID documents.
You know, IB, RAW, CBI...
But if you look at it in another angle,
it's right too!
But we sent him with a
different identity;
Sometimes, you will have to help
people, at certain instances.
I don't even have to
talk so much to you.
Likewise, how did all the circumstantial
evidence turn against Philip?
No. I didn't do it.
Aleena complained about
it to her parents.
And we used to fight
once in a while...
Had you asked for financial
help from Aleena?
debts to be repaid.
and you used to
beat her as well, right?
' A mud boat is going away,
swaying in a stream of tears '
' Not bidding goodbye,
all alone'
' Falling into the fire within my heart,

relationships are like a wound that hurts'
' On the stone-cross of love,
relationships are like a wound that hurts'
There are some dogs which bite & rip apart
the prey, when they are sent to hunt.
They have put you in charge
of this investigation,
they will be able to claim that
you did it using your influence,
When they say that I killed the girl
I loved more than anything in this world..
You had nothing to do in this, right?
Even if the world is against you,
As you said, if Philip was
someone she trusted so much...
There are investigation agencies
above you as well, right?
it needn't be true
that he did it.
You're talking with the pre-conceived
notion that your brother is right.
You were the one who concluded,
You said that she left because he
called her, on the day she died.
Must have been a call requesting
to meet her in person.
'It hurts when the person that
made you feel special yesterday,
is abandoning me today.
If she had felt that he is going to
hurt her, wouldn't she say that first?
can't he reach a decision that it's not
enough and that she must be killed?
I don't feel any mismatch here, sir.
the cause of death was a breathing
difficulty while drowning in water.
We didn't find any fingerprints
from the steering wheel.
And the hair strands found from
Aleena's right hand, belong to Philip.
No, Madam.
The investigation is still going on.
Sir.
I have taught him to see every
woman through that perspective.
I was asked to sever
ties with my own blood!
But all the evidence is against you.
I had boozed quite
a lot that night.
Yes.
She had told her parents that she's going
to meet you, after she got your call.
Do you usually booze so much?
Everyone was there.
Nizam lkka, Arun and Salman!
It doesn't matter whether he
had boozed or used drugs then.
But...
There's proof that his mobile phone was
at your place for the whole night.
and came back around 4 AM in the
morning, took his mobile & left.
How will I face everyone else now?
You can do it!
lchaya!
Sir, the charge-sheet is ready.
DNA reports, circumstantial
evidence and witness statements...
Philip's car has been captured on
the CCTV footage at Beach Road.
When we were young,
we used to sleep on the same bed.
In that, he was the policeman
and I was the thief.
In the story...
No. An officer like you,
shouldn't have asked that.
Your Honour,
The girl who loved him & trusted
him more than her own life,
for the maximum punishment
prescribed by law.
The prosecution has been able to prove
beyond doubt that the accused is guilty.
The Court also congratulates
the Public Prosecutor
And you did it!
' A mud boat is going away,
swaying in a stream of tears '
' The memories that remain
in life, are sobbing '
' As we see each other,
we are growing further apart '
' Where are the moments in which
we can see the light of truth? '
' A mud boat is going away,
swaying in a stream of tears '
' Not bidding goodbye,
all alone'

'Relationships are like a wound that
hurts, on the stone-cross of love'
It's true that our families will
suffer for the misdeeds that we do.
I thought why God is
crucifying me alone.
As 'lchaya'.
...I want to confess it to you.
- It's all pure luck, right?
- Of course!
Let's go meet her after this party.
- I'll be right back.
- Hey!
- Let me talk..
- You pervert!
She's dead, man!
Bloody swine plucked
out my hair...
We didn't do that while
we were in our senses.
It's always like this.
Don't drag me into this.
Diana, this is not the time
to take revenge for the past.
What new evidence
have you found?
I trusted your words,
more than my Philip.
You do whatever you want!
...you won't be alive.
Initially, he didn't want to meet you.
Didn't I tell you that I didn't do it?
I feel vengeful when I see you!
You tortured me, without even
considering me as your brother.
It's the courage to finish you!
He's in jail for a kidnapping case.
I had pleaded with him to
forgive my son just once.
I would have forgiven him if he proved
to me that he did something for me.
If you help me...
I will also help you in return.
From there, we will make the
arrangements for you to fly out.
He's completely all right, it seems.
After it's over,
you can escape to Nepal.
Yet...
...Philip wasn't the murderer; and
that Arun & Salman were behind it.
Revenge. That's the only
thing on his mind now.
- Give protection to
Derrick and Arun. - Sir.
I don't know what kind of protection
I should arrange for you.
The decision must be to
shoot him at sight, right?
Otherwise, you'll finish him, right?
I must be either the
prey or the hunter.
Look! It's quite funny.
Move!
It's the CCTV footage from
the supermarket, sir.
They are all so vindictive.
To hide, and to track
Derrick sir's movements.
His main job now is abusing and hitting the
policemen who're standing guard to him.
Bloody police swine!
He has been shot on the head.
Let me see the body once.
It's SP Sir.
Tell me the matter, sir.
I'm not saying that you should
get ready for an operation.
...and some people are putting a price
for a child's life using my name.
Don't keep the past in your mind.
Didn't you get anyone else
other than this drunkard?
Whatever you say, I can't
let this drunkard do this.
But now, there's no one who can
save our child, other than him.
they are demanding that
he should go to them.
You should deal this somehow.
...no one will have such a huge
amount as liquid cash with them.
Someone who precisely knows that you have
loads of cash with you, is behind this.
Pay the money you have with you,
and try to save the kid somehow.
- I am ready.
- So much cash...
All the phone calls I received
were from a satellite phone.
That means, this is not an operation we
can do based on a pre-constructed plan.
I don't want anyone
trying out any heroism!
How long will you escape by making the
police stand guard all around you?
He has escaped from the jail...
Keeping a safe distance.
- Sir.
...to attend the
Holy Qurbana on Sundays.
Here, you've promised them several
times that you will protect me.
Do you remember this place?
When I had to stay away from you for
a short while for the first time,
For your brother who trusted you,
who loved you more than his own life,
Stop here.
Accelerate at 120.
Then just leave the place.
...that is to shut up and do
exactly what I ask you to do.
Oh my God!
Where's the cash you took from the
waste box? - We don't have any cash, sir.
Some guy came and told us to go around the
waste box at sharp 2 PM & reach Lulu Mall.
Sir, didn't you ask
us to follow you?
And check all vehicles.
Alert all stations. - Okay sir.
When we were all running with our
tails on fire, where the hell were you?
I requested to meet all of you,
to narrate a story to all of you!
...is a story I reached through
certain speculations of mine,
To Derrick sir who loved
you & then cheated you,
Listen to what I have
to say, completely.
you let him out of the jail.
No! You let him
escape from the jail.
That's what I'm coming to.
My duty was only to
find Philip Abraham.
Where is my Allen?
Don't worry, Madam.
Isn't his whole life a failure, man?
All of us are being fooled.
That money...
Someone who came in those cars...
That money will reach its
deserving hands safely.
A play that Isaac sir operated,
upon Derrick sir's command.
The one who taught the younger brother to
shoot without causing any major injury
Derrick sir, who's
such a good shooter;
My first suspicion arose from the tyre
prints I found near Salman's body.
...and they were shot
dead at point blank...
...because sir's shoe-prints
were already imprinted there.
...and confirmed that it was
indeed sir's shoe-prints.
The phone calls between them?
That's why I told Madam,
Where will he hide this Philip?
So he scr***d us, right?
There would be so many similar
tyres & shoes, right?
When you all tried to destroy
him through loopholes in law,
Abraham's descendant!
It's time for us to leave.
I don't care if he's
Abraham's descendant!
There's a ritual where the marsh is
destroyed, to destroy the mosquitoes.
Finally, a chance to see you victorious!
When you feel that you are too smart,
Innocent children are going astray.
Glory be to Jesus!
Glory be to Him,
now and forever!
