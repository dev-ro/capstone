<b>YOURVICEE IS A LOCEKED ROOM</b>
<b>AND ONLY I HAVETHE KEY</b>
<b>Ah yes!</b>
<b>She defnitely deserved being</b>
<b>compared to Mary Stuart.</b>
<b>No-one else has been represented</b>
<b>in such different ways,</b>
<b>as a murderer or a martyr.</b>
<b>But she was a woman,</b>
<b>a great woman.</b>
<b>Seems his mother was</b>
<b>an important actress.</b>
<b>Yes, she made a career passing</b>
<b>from one bed to another.</b>
<b>To my mother!</b>
<b>He misses his mother,</b>
<b>it happens a lot with Italians.</b>
<b>What about you?</b>
<b>Not drinking?</b>
<b>Well, you sons of bitches</b>
<b>-even kids use the</b>
<b>term these days -</b>
<b>offer my wife something to drink.</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>Be generous...</b>
<b>to my wife!</b>
<b>Drink.</b>
<b>Maybe you'd prefer drinking</b>
<b>from my empty skull?</b>
<b>Oliviero,</b>
<b>I don't want to.</b>
<b>-To our health, my wife.</b>
<b>- Oliviero!</b>
<b>Drink it down.</b>
<b>Yes my dear,</b>
<b>we have a Visigoth education</b>
<b>here in Veneto.</b>
<b>I'm sorry, mistress,</b>
<b>maybe I got the measures wrong.</b>
<b>Where are you going?</b>
<b>This is Brenda.</b>
<b>Not bad for a maid, eh?</b>
<b>Losing the CEolonies and gaining</b>
<b>a servant like Brenda</b>
<b>was a good deal.</b>
<b>You have a weakness for</b>
<b>black women, Oliviero?</b>
<b>White males have always felt that way.</b>
<b>Perhaps a black woman</b>
<b>is everyone's secret dream.</b>
<b>It's clothes that ruin the world.</b>
<b>Naked, we're all the same.</b>
<b>It's so easy for these youngsters</b>
<b>to think they're something</b>
<b>as soon as it's obvious that</b>
<b>they're actually nothing.</b>
<b>How dare you wear that?</b>
<b>Why, doesn't seeing me dressed</b>
<b>like her turn you on?</b>
<b>You wanted to put on</b>
<b>a show like always,</b>
<b>so why not in costume?</b>
<b>What was your mother to you,</b>
<b>Maria the madwoman</b>
<b>or bloodthirsty Maria?</b>
<b>You're a whore,</b>
<b>a dirty whore.</b>
<b>They drink, damn but they drink!</b>
<b>I've nothing against drinking, CEhrist knows.</b>
<b>I like raising a glass now and then</b>
<b>but they never stop,</b>
<b>it's every single night.</b>
<b>They always have friends</b>
<b>visiting, Mrs Molinari.</b>
<b>Friends? They're the crazies</b>
<b>from the campsite...</b>
<b>lunatics, krauts</b>
<b>and foreigners.</b>
<b>Oh Jesus, I'm not talking about you,</b>
<b>but Mr Oliviero freQuents</b>
<b>certain people...</b>
<b>And just think I saw</b>
<b>him being born!</b>
<b>I was a servant in this house</b>
<b>when his mother</b>
<b>the CEountess was a girl...</b>
<b>what times!</b>
<b>Hello, Satan!</b>
<b>He's the only intelligent</b>
<b>animal in the area.</b>
<b>Have a bit of respect for</b>
<b>this poor old woman!</b>
<b>Hello.</b>
<b>Listen, Dario, seeing as</b>
<b>you know the maid,</b>
<b>why don't you put in a good word</b>
<b>for me with the mistress!</b>
<b>Having both of them would be fne with me,</b>
<b>I've always liked white coffee in bed.</b>
<b>Forget it, they're not for you.</b>
<b>You can't even imagine what</b>
<b>goes on at Villa Ruvigny.</b>
<b>Dealing with international couriers</b>
<b>is getting more diffcult every</b>
<b>day Mr Ruvigny,</b>
<b>ordering books from Paris or London</b>
<b>means waiting months,</b>
<b>even if things go well.</b>
<b>Usual place tonight?</b>
<b>Alright,</b>
<b>but it's not defnite,</b>
<b>I might be busy.</b>
<b>Listen, the excuse of being busy</b>
<b>doesn't work with me.</b>
<b>You started working on me</b>
<b>over the high school desks,</b>
<b>teacher, and now</b>
<b>you'll pay the price.</b>
<b>How are things going, Mr Ruvigny?</b>
<b>Of course, my dear.</b>
<b>Put it on my account, Bartoli.</b>
<b>Certainly.</b>
<b>I often ask myself why Zenit</b>
<b>don't reprint your books,</b>
<b>I'd love to see them</b>
<b>in the shop window again.</b>
<b>You really should find another</b>
<b>publisher, Mr Ruvigny.</b>
<b>-Good bye.</b>
<b>- Always at your service.</b>
<b>I'll kill you one of these days.</b>
<b>Even if I have to stuff you</b>
<b>with cyanide, I'll kill you.</b>
<b>How do you intend to exorcise Satan,</b>
<b>with a broom?</b>
<b>Ijust want him to stay away</b>
<b>from my doves.</b>
<b>Are you dining in town tonight?</b>
<b>Maybe.</b>
<b>Help!</b>
<b>Help!</b>
<b>Help!</b>
<b>No</b>
<b>Oliviero.</b>
<b>Oliviero!</b>
<b>-What?</b>
<b>- Someone's coming.</b>
<b>- Someone?</b>
<b>-Yes, it's a police car.</b>
<b>What could they</b>
<b>want from us?</b>
<b>I didn't hear you</b>
<b>come in last night.</b>
<b>Brenda's not here so you'll have to get it.</b>
<b>Get dressed.</b>
<b>- In a deep sleep, aren't they inspector?</b>
<b>-Yep.</b>
<b>-Good morning.</b>
<b>- Mr Ruvigny?</b>
<b>-What do you want?</b>
<b>- I apologise...</b>
<b>I apologise for the unusual hour,</b>
<b>I'm Inspector Farla.</b>
<b>It's a bother I know,</b>
<b>but I have to ask you</b>
<b>some Questions.</b>
<b>About what?</b>
<b>Something...</b>
<b>private.</b>
<b>I am Oliviero Ruvigny.</b>
<b>I know you very well Mr Ruvigny,</b>
<b>at least by name.</b>
<b>Even we Inspectors are victims</b>
<b>of compulsory education...</b>
<b>We occasionally read books.</b>
<b>Perhaps it would be better</b>
<b>if we went inside, Mr Ruvigny.</b>
<b>Of course, come with me.</b>
<b>I understand it won't</b>
<b>be pleasant for madam,</b>
<b>but I'd like to exchange</b>
<b>some words in private.</b>
<b>Why? I've got no</b>
<b>secrets from my wife.</b>
<b>As you prefer,</b>
<b>it'll be Quicker.</b>
<b>You made a date for last night</b>
<b>with a shop assistant</b>
<b>from the Roma Bookshop,</b>
<b>am I wrong?</b>
<b>Who, Fausta?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>we used to see each other a lot,</b>
<b>inspector, but definitely not last night.</b>
<b>I was a teacher atTasso</b>
<b>High School ten years ago</b>
<b>and Fausta was one of my students.</b>
<b>And they speak badly of students!</b>
<b>To keep a friendship going</b>
<b>with her own teacher for ten years.</b>
<b>It's lovely, don't you agree,</b>
<b>madam?</b>
<b>Very...</b>
<b>Oliviero's students always had</b>
<b>a great weakness for him.</b>
<b>I expect it's a school desk complex.</b>
<b>How much sugar?</b>
<b>None thank you madam.</b>
<b>If I understand correctly,</b>
<b>- Fausta's accused me of not going on a date?</b>
<b>-Vittorio.</b>
<b>She probably didn't have time.</b>
<b>We don't believe she died accidentally,</b>
<b>Mr Ruvigny.</b>
<b>It really is Fausta.</b>
<b>- But who could have...</b>
<b>- ...killed her so horribly?</b>
<b>That's what we've got to fnd out.</b>
<b>All we know for now</b>
<b>is she was killed...</b>
<b>with a curved blade,</b>
<b>a sickle perhaps.</b>
<b>Mr Ruvigny...</b>
<b>where were you from 8 till 10,</b>
<b>from 8 till 10 last night?</b>
<b>I was here in the villa,</b>
<b>my wife can confirm it.</b>
<b>Ah...</b>
<b>I see.</b>
<b>Can anyone else confrm it,</b>
<b>a servant for example?</b>
<b>We have a coloured woman with us.</b>
<b>It was her day off yesterday</b>
<b>and she stayed out last night as well.</b>
<b>- No guests in the villa last night?</b>
<b>-Why?</b>
<b>I'm talking about the inhabitants</b>
<b>from that amusing asylum</b>
<b>called Mondial CEamping.</b>
<b>You know, madam,</b>
<b>that the most popular</b>
<b>entertainment in town is gossiping.</b>
<b>No, no-one was</b>
<b>here last night.</b>
<b>Fine. Sorry to disturb you,</b>
<b>but I don't think this'll</b>
<b>be the last time.</b>
<b>A crime in these parts</b>
<b>raises a lot of dust.</b>
<b>You don't have any plans</b>
<b>to travel do you Mr Ruvigny?</b>
<b>-Travel? No nothing.</b>
<b>- I thought so</b>
<b>a writer has his world inside him.</b>
<b>Anyway, don't go far from the villa.</b>
<b>Of course, inspector.</b>
<b>-Goodbye, madam.</b>
<b>- Goodbye.</b>
<b>The bookseller probably</b>
<b>overheard our conversation.</b>
<b>That girl tormented me for years</b>
<b>...unbearable.</b>
<b>She didn't want to accept</b>
<b>it was fnished.</b>
<b>But thanks, anyway.</b>
<b>You could have given me up</b>
<b>and sent me inside.</b>
<b>I was late last night</b>
<b>because I had a problem,</b>
<b>- I punctured a tyre.</b>
<b>- I didn't ask any Questions.</b>
<b>Right, but you think I could</b>
<b>easily cut a lover's throat.</b>
<b>A bad writer but a</b>
<b>good sadistic murderer.</b>
<b>Who knows if I'll</b>
<b>become one some day,</b>
<b>and it'll be your throat's turn?</b>
<b>-You don't ask Questions, eh!</b>
<b>- Leave me alone.</b>
<b>I had the tyre repaired,</b>
<b>don't you forget it.</b>
<b>Be careful what you say and do,</b>
<b>very careful!</b>
<b>Oliviero!</b>
<b>The kids from the campsite</b>
<b>are here, sir.</b>
<b>Shall I let them in?</b>
<b>Send them away.</b>
<b>I've already got two tarts living here...</b>
<b>Get lost.</b>
<b>Go away!</b>
<b>The police...</b>
<b>You've got to call the police!</b>
<b>The police? They already</b>
<b>suspect me for one girl</b>
<b>it'd be like putting a noose around my neck.</b>
<b>They'd say I'm a maniac, a homicidal maniac.</b>
<b>-You've got to!</b>
<b>- I can't, Irene.</b>
<b>They'd never believe it wasn't me...</b>
<b>And neither do you.</b>
<b>Please help me.</b>
<b>We've got to do something...</b>
<b>we've got to hide the corpse.</b>
<b>- Hide the corpse?</b>
<b>-Of course.</b>
<b>Listen, Irene,</b>
<b>no-one will look for her.</b>
<b>We'll say she left...</b>
<b>Yes, she left and we</b>
<b>don't know anything.</b>
<b>In the cellar...</b>
<b>we've got to hide her</b>
<b>in a wall in the cellar,</b>
<b>and no-one will ever fnd her...</b>
<b>No-one will ever fnd her.</b>
<b>We've got to remove the stains,</b>
<b>really clean it.</b>
<b>-Why don't you bury it with her?</b>
<b>- No, I can't.</b>
<b>You know I can't.</b>
<b>Damn, you can see it.</b>
<b>Wow, what legs!</b>
<b>Put it over there.</b>
<b>Why you, Madam?</b>
<b>Isn't Brenda here?</b>
<b>- She left.</b>
<b>- Left for good?</b>
<b>Just think...</b>
<b>Why, is something wrong?</b>
<b>Nothing. It's just that I got on well</b>
<b>with the blonde.</b>
<b>I called her 'the blonde' as a joke.</b>
<b>Oh, I almost forgot, a telegram.</b>
<b>Pegolotti gave it to me at the post offce.</b>
<b>So I did two jobs in one journey.</b>
<b>- A telegram?</b>
<b>-Yes. I hope it's good news.</b>
<b>ARRIVE MONDAYTRAIN 15;00.</b>
<b>GREETINGS FLORIANA</b>
<b>That snotty pain in the arse.</b>
<b>She chose the perfect time</b>
<b>to come and get under our feet.</b>
<b>-Was she at our wedding?</b>
<b>- I think so.</b>
<b>My sister brought</b>
<b>her from Paris.</b>
<b>Your niece will be 20 now.</b>
<b>Right.</b>
<b>- Hey!</b>
<b>-What did he do?</b>
<b>He touched me here!</b>
<b>Well it's big, but it doesn't</b>
<b>break any boundaries!</b>
<b>What a cheek!</b>
<b>Giovanna,</b>
<b>welcome back!</b>
<b>If you'd have touched</b>
<b>the old woman's arse</b>
<b>- I'd have cut your hand off!</b>
<b>- Soldiers...</b>
<b>what do you expect when</b>
<b>there are no brothels any more?</b>
<b>She wasn't on it.</b>
<b>Lets go.</b>
<b>What an idiot! First she invites herself,</b>
<b>then she makes us</b>
<b>come out here for nothing.</b>
<b>It's just as well.</b>
<b>Hello, Oliviero!</b>
<b>Thanks. Bye.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>
<b>I hitched.</b>
<b>The lieutenant was very kind,</b>
<b>he has to go to the airport</b>
<b>but he made a detour for me.</b>
<b>-Why the face?</b>
<b>- I'm shocked. Are you...</b>
<b>Floriana, yes...</b>
<b>be watchful with shocks,</b>
<b>at your age you might</b>
<b>have a heart attack!</b>
<b>- How are you Irene?</b>
<b>- Fine, dear.</b>
<b>It's pointless asking how you are,</b>
<b>you look wonderful.</b>
<b>Lets go.The sooner</b>
<b>we arrive at the villa</b>
<b>the sooner we can have a drink.</b>
<b>-Give it to me, I'll carry it.</b>
<b>-Thanks.</b>
<b>How many rooms are there?</b>
<b>Too many.</b>
<b>But we've emptied a lot of them,</b>
<b>they were dangerous.</b>
<b>One of these days the roof</b>
<b>will fall in on our heads.</b>
<b>I've never had that feeling,</b>
<b>I've never had a roof of my own.</b>
<b>Being a genius doesn't pay,</b>
<b>does it?</b>
<b>Oliviero's sure the novel's dead.</b>
<b>In truth it's he who's dead.</b>
<b>He hasn't been able to write</b>
<b>a sentence for years.</b>
<b>The only thing he can sell</b>
<b>these days is the furniture.</b>
<b>It's only a cat,</b>
<b>a beautiful one too.</b>
<b>You're scared of it?</b>
<b>It's called Satan.</b>
<b>It was his mother's.</b>
<b>Aunt Ester's?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Oh...</b>
<b>Well, well,</b>
<b>a black stocking!</b>
<b>What's it for, Irene, a fetish?</b>
<b>Give it to me!</b>
<b>It was left by a girl</b>
<b>we used to have.</b>
<b>She left, but she wasn't</b>
<b>much of a maid.</b>
<b>Coming, Flo?</b>
<b>So, in Paris you lived</b>
<b>in a commune?</b>
<b>Yes, for six months.</b>
<b>What did you do there?</b>
<b>Just about everything.</b>
<b>Hear that, Irene?</b>
<b>A commune would do you good.</b>
<b>Where the women</b>
<b>are everyone's.</b>
<b>Where the men</b>
<b>are everyone's!</b>
<b>He's a bit retarded about sex</b>
<b>and terrifed of impotence,</b>
<b>literary impotence of course.</b>
<b>Sex is an activity that's only interests</b>
<b>those who have imagination</b>
<b>as well as the means.</b>
<b>Irene has neither.</b>
<b>Hasn't the tired illustrious writer</b>
<b>forgotten something?</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>The means and imagination, yes...</b>
<b>and something else.</b>
<b>Go and see who it is.</b>
<b>Good evening.</b>
<b>The gate was open.</b>
<b>They told me to deliver</b>
<b>this to you.</b>
<b>-Thank you. Good night.</b>
<b>-Good night.</b>
<b>What is it?</b>
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>-You sent it out to be cleaned!</b>
<b>- No, I didn't.</b>
<b>Lets go upstairs.</b>
<b>No Oliviero,</b>
<b>I beg you!</b>
<b>Irene.</b>
<b>Irene!</b>
<b>Oliviero?</b>
<b>-What's going on?</b>
<b>- Nothing, nothing serious.</b>
<b>Irene doesn't feel well.</b>
<b>She's a bit tired, that's all.</b>
<b>- Perhaps she needs something?</b>
<b>- No!</b>
<b>She doesn't need anything,</b>
<b>I told you she's just tired.</b>
<b>We don't have any servants.</b>
<b>I'm tired too, my journey</b>
<b>was Quite demanding.</b>
<b>I'm going to bed.</b>
<b>Who is it?</b>
<b>I'm sorry, but I've got some</b>
<b>old notes in that wardrobe.</b>
<b>Need some writing paper?</b>
<b>No, I'm just writing down</b>
<b>some addresses.</b>
<b>Like your niece, do you?</b>
<b>Whatever Oliviero Ruvigny's</b>
<b>state might be today</b>
<b>married or not, decadent or not</b>
<b>Floriana is willing to bring pleasure into his life</b>
<b>in the name of depravation.</b>
<b>Listen...how come you</b>
<b>decided to come here?</b>
<b>I've wanted to come here</b>
<b>since I found out Aunt Ester died.</b>
<b>And what did you</b>
<b>fnd out about me?</b>
<b>The usual stuff.</b>
<b>That since you got married</b>
<b>your mind's been frazzled.</b>
<b>That you're a pig, an alcoholic,</b>
<b>a drug addict,</b>
<b>etcetera, etcetera...</b>
<b>Etcetera, etcetera...</b>
<b>Tell me...</b>
<b>is it true you slept with</b>
<b>your mother in her bed?</b>
<b>I mean when you'd grown up?</b>
<b>Is it true you're a two bit tart?</b>
<b>Well, it could be two bits well-spent...</b>
<b>Irene!</b>
<b>Why did he lock</b>
<b>you in here?</b>
<b>He told me you weren't well.</b>
<b>-Can you make it to my bedroom?</b>
<b>-Yes</b>
<b>-Where is he?</b>
<b>- I heard him leave just now.</b>
<b>Bloody hell, why didn't</b>
<b>you ask for help?</b>
<b>He's a damn sadist.</b>
<b>You don't know,</b>
<b>you don't know.</b>
<b>He's sick, he scares me.</b>
<b>You mean he's mad?</b>
<b>Sometimes he doesn't</b>
<b>know what he's doing.</b>
<b>Come on, lets go to my room.</b>
<b>I knew Oliviero's family</b>
<b>were crazy but...</b>
<b>a doctor must be involved.</b>
<b>No, no, no.</b>
<b>No doctors,</b>
<b>no outsiders.</b>
<b>Irene, I want to help you,</b>
<b>you've got to trust me.</b>
<b>What's going on?</b>
<b>The police came...</b>
<b>a few days ago.</b>
<b>They'd found the body of a girl...</b>
<b>who was murdered.</b>
<b>Now you know everything.</b>
<b>But you can't live with someone</b>
<b>you think's a murderer.</b>
<b>I beg you, Floriana,</b>
<b>not a word to Oliviero</b>
<b>about what I told you.</b>
<b>If he thinks...</b>
<b>my God, he'd kill me.</b>
<b>Not while I'm here.</b>
<b>You're burning up,</b>
<b>you've got the fever.</b>
<b>You've nothing</b>
<b>to worry about,</b>
<b>I won't say a word.</b>
<b>I'm on your side,</b>
<b>you know.</b>
<b>You're so sweet.</b>
<b>- But now...</b>
<b>-What?</b>
<b>Now you know everything</b>
<b>you'll want to leave.</b>
<b>And you'd be right.</b>
<b>I haven't even considered it.</b>
<b>We two must be allies.</b>
<b>Allies.</b>
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>
<b>Yes?</b>
<b>Oh, good evening sir.</b>
<b>Giovanna's just arrived</b>
<b>from Brescia today.</b>
<b>Oh yes, she's</b>
<b>just like a lioness!</b>
<b>Yes, tomorrow.</b>
<b>Tonight?!</b>
<b>She's tired, poor girl,</b>
<b>there's been a rush...</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>See you tomorrow, sir.</b>
<b>Complete discretion, sir.</b>
<b>Good night.</b>
<b>Madame, I'm really tired,</b>
<b>I'm going to bed.</b>
<b>Good night, my girl.</b>
<b>Tomorrow starts well:</b>
<b>50,000 a time!</b>
<b>Good night.</b>
<b>-Good night, madame.</b>
<b>-Get some rest.</b>
<b>Madame, is that you?</b>
<b>Sleeping beauty,</b>
<b>got any cream?</b>
<b>Sleeping?</b>
<b>I'd like to wake up with you.</b>
<b>And the cream?</b>
<b>First class.</b>
<b>Really fresh and appreciated</b>
<b>throughout the area.</b>
<b>-You're not Italian, are you.</b>
<b>- Half and half.</b>
<b>I see, so they've conned</b>
<b>another woman.</b>
<b>There was a black woman before you</b>
<b>who said she was eQual</b>
<b>but they got her to be their servant.</b>
<b>Maybe that's why she left.</b>
<b>-You knew her well?</b>
<b>- Like peas in a pod.</b>
<b>- Sorry, do you understand Italian well?</b>
<b>- So she left you?</b>
<b>She disappeared,</b>
<b>one fine morning she was gone.</b>
<b>As long as she didn't</b>
<b>end up like Giovanna...</b>
<b>Meaning?</b>
<b>-Good morning, Mr Ruvigny.</b>
<b>-Good morning.</b>
<b>I'm racing a bike on Sunday.</b>
<b>If you come you'll see</b>
<b>I'm not that sleepy...</b>
<b>They like me, they like me,</b>
<b>that's for sure!</b>
<b>European integration's not bad,</b>
<b>don't you agree Mr Ruvigny?</b>
<b>I'm sorry, inspector,</b>
<b>but I've been really out</b>
<b>of touch for a while.</b>
<b>Integration of what?</b>
<b>Here we are in a peaceful Veneto town,</b>
<b>with German beer,</b>
<b>Scottish whisky...</b>
<b>...and atomic condiments</b>
<b>for everyone.</b>
<b>That's the trouble with you</b>
<b>intellectuals...pessimism.</b>
<b>Is there anything to laugh about?</b>
<b>I didn't think the Homicide SQuad</b>
<b>was a school of humour.</b>
<b>No, Quite the opposite.</b>
<b>We do what we can with</b>
<b>what we've got.</b>
<b>Exceptional eQuipment...</b>
<b>Just think, our forensic scientist's</b>
<b>even got a magnifying glass!</b>
<b>But,joking apart,</b>
<b>I must apologise to you.</b>
<b>Apologise? Why?</b>
<b>- About Bartoli.</b>
<b>- Ah.</b>
<b>-The bookseller.</b>
<b>- His real name's Liguori,</b>
<b>he escaped from Boretto</b>
<b>Psychiatric Prison 8 years ago.</b>
<b>He killed the two girls</b>
<b>in a fit of madness.</b>
<b>Good, so you won't have</b>
<b>any more problems, inspector.</b>
<b>But problems have a trait,</b>
<b>they never end...</b>
<b>Now my dear wife knows</b>
<b>that I didn't kill the girl.</b>
<b>Now she knows but a woodworm's</b>
<b>eroding her brain.</b>
<b>The woodworm's working away</b>
<b>and says he was the murderer,</b>
<b>that the murderer sleeps</b>
<b>next to her in bed.</b>
<b>- Leave me alone, you're drunk!</b>
<b>-Yes, I'm drunk,</b>
<b>like I was drunk that night.</b>
<b>But it wasn't me who</b>
<b>killed the black maid.</b>
<b>I didn't kill that dirty black,</b>
<b>I didn't kill her, it wasn't me!</b>
<b>So why don't you tell the police?</b>
<b>Let me...</b>
<b>You're crazy, you're crazy,</b>
<b>you're killing me...</b>
<b>You're killing me...</b>
<b>Let me go...</b>
<b>Dario Luisetti, number 7,</b>
<b>has taken the lead on lap 5</b>
<b>and looks like he's got the race.</b>
<b>In second place number 3</b>
<b>Armando Gardiglia,</b>
<b>in third LucioTaramaglio</b>
<b>Then there's the Spaniard</b>
<b>Luis Soler-Borrego...</b>
<b>Come on! Quick!</b>
<b>Brilliant!</b>
<b>Come on! Great!</b>
<b>Go on!</b>
<b>Attention please!</b>
<b>A surprise change!</b>
<b>Number 7 Dario Luisetti's</b>
<b>stopped at Broom Bend</b>
<b>with mechanical problems</b>
<b>and maybe he's out for good.</b>
<b>LucioTaramaglio's taken the lead,</b>
<b>followed by Luis Soler-Borrego,</b>
<b>but Armando Gardiglia's</b>
<b>attacking on the bend as well...</b>
<b>Damn! Excuse me,</b>
<b>where's Broom Bend?</b>
<b>Down there.</b>
<b>Thanks.</b>
<b>Son of a bitch!</b>
<b>Piece of shit!</b>
<b>Did you really have to break down</b>
<b>3 laps from the fnish!</b>
<b>Hi, motor-biker!</b>
<b>Look at this!</b>
<b>I've been preparing for this</b>
<b>bloody race for 3 months</b>
<b>and the piston jammed</b>
<b>just when I was winning!!</b>
<b>-What's a piston?</b>
<b>-You can get lost as well!</b>
<b>Come back, Floriana...</b>
<b>I'm sorry.</b>
<b>This race meant everything to me,</b>
<b>understand, everything!</b>
<b>Everything?</b>
<b>See, they're on the last lap...</b>
<b>Lets go.</b>
<b>-Were we are.</b>
<b>-Where?</b>
<b>This is a good spot.</b>
<b>A double parka and a North Pole style</b>
<b>sleeping bag against rheumatism.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Don't tell me you come here</b>
<b>to make love?</b>
<b>Why not? Where should we go,</b>
<b>the Grand Hotel?</b>
<b>And it's more romantic here.</b>
<b>Mind your head.</b>
<b>The bed's ready in a second.</b>
<b>Did you bring the</b>
<b>black girl here too?</b>
<b>Still on about her?</b>
<b>Jealous, are you?</b>
<b>Come on, get undressed,</b>
<b>it's not cold.</b>
<b>CEome on, hurry up.</b>
<b>How many zips have you got?</b>
<b>God, you're taking your time!</b>
<b>Wow... if I win the lottery</b>
<b>I swear I'll get a maid just like you.</b>
<b>Come on, lets seal ourselves inside</b>
<b>and never come out.</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>I like you.</b>
<b>We might or might not do this again,</b>
<b>but no complications, understand?</b>
<b>Who's there?</b>
<b>What do you want?</b>
<b>I'm the rag and bone woman,</b>
<b>I'm here for the bottles.</b>
<b>Go away,</b>
<b>go away!</b>
<b>- So, when will we meet up again?</b>
<b>-Who knows...</b>
<b>- Didn't you like it?</b>
<b>-Of course...</b>
<b>Well, tell me when you're free.</b>
<b>- I'm always free. Bye.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>
<b>You'll give me a heart attack!</b>
<b>What are you doing</b>
<b>here in the dark?</b>
<b>What's up?</b>
<b>What's happened?</b>
<b>Aterrible thing, Flo.</b>
<b>That bloody animal...</b>
<b>I'm scared,</b>
<b>I'm really scared.</b>
<b>Only you can help me.</b>
<b>Calm down, Irene,</b>
<b>calm down.</b>
<b>Explain what happened.</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>that bloody animal,</b>
<b>that diabolical bloody animal.</b>
<b>Irene.</b>
<b>- Is she dead?</b>
<b>-Oh, shut up!</b>
<b>Why did you buy those disgusting things?</b>
<b>Disgusting?</b>
<b>It's a matter of taste...</b>
<b>Satan's crazy for sheep's eyes.</b>
<b>Come on Irene,</b>
<b>it was nothing.</b>
<b>Why don't you go and get her</b>
<b>a cardio-tonic or something?</b>
<b>Satan's on heat as well.</b>
<b>He hasn't been seen</b>
<b>since yesterday.</b>
<b>If life had given me</b>
<b>someone like you,</b>
<b>everything would</b>
<b>have been different.</b>
<b>How young you are...</b>
<b>-Go away, bloody animal!</b>
<b>-CEalm down, it's all over.</b>
<b>They scared you but it was nothing.</b>
<b>Have a drink.</b>
<b>Don't be scared,</b>
<b>he hasn't realised yet.</b>
<b>And luckily the cat's disappeared.</b>
<b>Was the black girl dressed like this</b>
<b>when you killed her?</b>
<b>I'm definitely not Mary Stuart</b>
<b>but then you don't have</b>
<b>Lord Leicester's face.</b>
<b>I learnt something reading this</b>
<b>about the 'bloody letters'</b>
<b>and the battle between</b>
<b>the two Queens...</b>
<b>Edifying, isn't it?</b>
<b>What did Irene tell you?</b>
<b>That she shares her bed with a crazy,</b>
<b>alcoholic murderer?</b>
<b>No, nothing like that.</b>
<b>The poor woman's terrified</b>
<b>because of everything</b>
<b>that's happened.</b>
<b>- And you?</b>
<b>- I'm keeping my eyes wide open, that's all.</b>
<b>When I saw you yesterday</b>
<b>in the hay loft</b>
<b>-of course I saw you,</b>
<b>who else could it have been?-</b>
<b>I wanted you inside</b>
<b>the sleeping bag.</b>
<b>Didn't you want to as well?</b>
<b>You really are the little whore</b>
<b>I thought you were.</b>
<b>And you're really the pig</b>
<b>they say you are?</b>
<b>Take that thing off.</b>
<b>Why don't you take it off</b>
<b>with your own hands?</b>
<b>No...</b>
<b>What's wrong?</b>
<b>Irene!</b>
<b>Irene.</b>
<b>where did these come from?</b>
<b>Would you mind</b>
<b>answering me, Irene?</b>
<b>I couldn't find the old ones</b>
<b>so I bought those.</b>
<b>- Strange.</b>
<b>-Why?</b>
<b>I haven't seen the cat for two days,</b>
<b>he hasn't even come to eat.</b>
<b>Don't you think it's strange?</b>
<b>What did you do to him,</b>
<b>did you hurt him?</b>
<b>You're crazy.Why would I?</b>
<b>Why would you?</b>
<b>I know why, because you've always hated him</b>
<b>because my mother liked him,</b>
<b>because he belongs to me,</b>
<b>because he's mine,</b>
<b>which you'll never be</b>
<b>because you're a whore,</b>
<b>a dirty bloody whore!</b>
<b>I beg you Oliviero,</b>
<b>I can't stand it.</b>
<b>Stop scaring me...</b>
<b>I'd just have to dig these in a bit,</b>
<b>just a bit...</b>
<b>You're hurting me...</b>
<b>Excuse me, sir.</b>
<b>-Yes? Oh, good morning Mrs Molinari.</b>
<b>-Good morning.</b>
<b>I want to speak to the police chief.</b>
<b>The police station's right there in front of you.</b>
<b>-Thank you. Goodbye.</b>
<b>-Goodbye.</b>
<b>You wish he was dead,</b>
<b>don't you?</b>
<b>I've noticed your life's hell</b>
<b>so why do you stay?</b>
<b>He'd never let me go.</b>
<b>Maybe you're wrong.</b>
<b>Last night he told me</b>
<b>he wanted to kill you.</b>
<b>No, then he'd destroy</b>
<b>what entertains him,</b>
<b>his victim.</b>
<b>He just wanted to scare you.</b>
<b>All he wants is to get into your bed.</b>
<b>He's already done that.</b>
<b>Jealous? You're jealous?</b>
<b>No, not in the way you think.</b>
<b>He's a failure...</b>
<b>not only as a writer,</b>
<b>and he knows it.</b>
<b>He hides it from himself.</b>
<b>Maybe it caused all the problems.</b>
<b>Maybe you haven't thought</b>
<b>about ending it for good.</b>
<b>It wouldn't take much.</b>
<b>No?</b>
<b>No.There's an embarrassing</b>
<b>number of choices...</b>
<b>Ideas like a picnic with a tragic ending,</b>
<b>a leap into the ravine,</b>
<b>the inconsolable widow.</b>
<b>Romantic, isn't it?</b>
<b>Now I've found you</b>
<b>I can't stand her anymore.</b>
<b>I can't carry on being stuck between</b>
<b>a hysterical woman</b>
<b>and an erotomaniac.</b>
<b>If you continue</b>
<b>I'll leave this house.</b>
<b>Go away now,</b>
<b>Irene could come in any</b>
<b>minute and I don't want</b>
<b>to be involved in one of</b>
<b>your uniQue spectacles.</b>
<b>This time I swear</b>
<b>I'll get rid of her.</b>
<b>I've already thought</b>
<b>about how to do it,</b>
<b>but please don't leave me.</b>
<b>I've re-opened that</b>
<b>hole in the cellar,</b>
<b>there's room for her too.</b>
<b>-This time I'll really do it.</b>
<b>-You're drunk.</b>
<b>I told you to leave.</b>
<b>You're spying on me,</b>
<b>you dirty worm.</b>
<b>I'll break your neck!</b>
<b>Watch out or I'll kill you!</b>
<b>-What do you want?</b>
<b>- CEome down!</b>
<b>I can't.</b>
<b>- I've got a race, I've got to leave tomorrow morning.</b>
<b>- So?</b>
<b>Why don't you come with me?</b>
<b>The race is in Cesenatico</b>
<b>and if I do well I'll be</b>
<b>taken on for track races.</b>
<b>I'll wait for you at 7 on the bridge.</b>
<b>Come on, we'll have fun!</b>
<b>Get lost or you'll wake everyone.</b>
<b>Only if you say you'll come.</b>
<b>Alright, alright I'll come.</b>
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>KILL HER AND HIDE HER INTHE CEELLARWALL</b>
<b>So you made a decision.</b>
<b>I was beginning to wonder if you'd do it.</b>
<b>I...I don't know what...</b>
<b>Look, look! He really wanted to kill me.</b>
<b>He'd already prepared the hole in the cellar</b>
<b>next to the other girl.</b>
<b>You can tell it to the court.</b>
<b>In any case you'll get life, my dear.</b>
<b>You know judges are</b>
<b>almost always married</b>
<b>and it's unlikely they'll</b>
<b>absolve a wife who's...</b>
<b>understand?</b>
<b>They defend their privileges.</b>
<b>My mother told me Aunt Ester</b>
<b>had some very valuable jewels.</b>
<b>Where do you hide them?</b>
<b>You can tell me now that it's all mine.</b>
<b>Floriana, please don't</b>
<b>talk to me like that.</b>
<b>Those jewels are yours,</b>
<b>you can have them,</b>
<b>I don't care about that stuff...</b>
<b>But don't betray me.</b>
<b>Alright, partner.</b>
<b>Lets get rid of him.</b>
<b>Here, they're all here.</b>
<b>I don't even know what they're worth,</b>
<b>and I don't want to know.</b>
<b>Well, they're in bad taste,</b>
<b>but they're worth a lot.</b>
<b>Aunt Ester made all her</b>
<b>lovers give her jewels.</b>
<b>Take them, they're yours.</b>
<b>I should go now.</b>
<b>No, not yet, please.</b>
<b>I'm scared.</b>
<b>I think you'll have to get used to it, sooner or later.</b>
<b>Sooner would be better.</b>
<b>What will you say about</b>
<b>good old Oliviero?</b>
<b>That he left,</b>
<b>he went abroad,</b>
<b>and then... I don't know.</b>
<b>- I'll leave the villa.</b>
<b>- Fine...</b>
<b>It's been a really lovely holiday.</b>
<b>Bye.</b>
<b>Floriana, please stay,</b>
<b>at least for tonight.</b>
<b>I beg you don't go.</b>
<b>Alright,just tonight.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>No, I know more pleasant</b>
<b>ways to help you to sleep.</b>
<b>Floriana.</b>
<b>Floriana!</b>
<b>Floriana?</b>
<b>REVENGE</b>
<b>REVENGE</b>
<b>Who's in there?</b>
<b>Why did you want me to stay?</b>
<b>Did you want to kill me too?</b>
<b>REVENGE</b>
<b>REVENGE</b>
<b>Floriana, what are you going to do?</b>
<b>Floriana!</b>
<b>Floriana.</b>
<b>Now I'm sure she'll be</b>
<b>on the bridge at 7,</b>
<b>she has no choice.</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>and it'll be the end and</b>
<b>the beginning of everything.</b>
<b>You got the end you deserved,</b>
<b>but I'm sorry you suffered so little.</b>
<b>Ijust hope there's something after death</b>
<b>so you'll be able to know</b>
<b>how long my revenge took!</b>
<b>I killed your bitch of a mother,</b>
<b>I had that dirty black girl killed.</b>
<b>You'll rot with her for eternity!</b>
<b>Can you hear me, Oliviero?!</b>
<b>Yes, it was me who had her killed</b>
<b>so new suspicions</b>
<b>would fall on you</b>
<b>after you'd already been accused</b>
<b>of that other crime.</b>
<b>It was easy...</b>
<b>It was easy</b>
<b>-with your alcohol-ruined memory-</b>
<b>to make you lose</b>
<b>confdence in yourself.</b>
<b>I destroyed you.</b>
<b>Day by day,</b>
<b>day after day.</b>
<b>And I'd have continued</b>
<b>to kill you bit by bit,</b>
<b>if I hadn't realised you</b>
<b>wanted to kill me too.</b>
<b>I hope some part of you</b>
<b>is still living somewhere,</b>
<b>and that you'll suffer for eternity!</b>
<b>It all went as slick as oil.</b>
<b>Don't worry, it was even</b>
<b>easier than the black girl.</b>
<b>And the jewels?</b>
<b>- Did you recover all of them?</b>
<b>-All of them.</b>
<b>She'd put them in a plastic bag.</b>
<b>Bitch!</b>
<b>Thought she was really shrewd.</b>
<b>The problem's the two corpses.</b>
<b>Why? It was a normal</b>
<b>road accident.</b>
<b>I mean the two bodies in the cellar,</b>
<b>they could be found.</b>
<b>CEome here,Walter,</b>
<b>I want to show you something.</b>
<b>We've got to bring them here at night,</b>
<b>agreed?</b>
<b>Deep enough?</b>
<b>I've nothing to add,</b>
<b>you always have good ideas.</b>
<b>Good afternoon, madam.</b>
<b>We were just about to leave,</b>
<b>no-one's home.</b>
<b>-Good afternoon.</b>
<b>-Good afternoon.</b>
<b>Here again?</b>
<b>I mean... what else is there?</b>
<b>My husband left this morning</b>
<b>- I don't know when he'll return.</b>
<b>-Just a formality.</b>
<b>A serious crime's been reported.</b>
<b>- A crime?</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>You tormented a cat.</b>
<b>- A cat?</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>Incredible, but we also have</b>
<b>to deal with such things.</b>
<b>Old Mrs Molinari,</b>
<b>the rag and bone woman</b>
<b>who used to be in the service</b>
<b>of the Countess Ester,</b>
<b>your husband's mother... you know?</b>
<b>- I remember her.</b>
<b>- She's offcially reported a crime.</b>
<b>Let me explain.</b>
<b>That bloody animal massacred</b>
<b>all my doves, so...</b>
<b>Yes, I understand.</b>
<b>But I told myself lets go</b>
<b>and speak to the Ruvignys</b>
<b>and then we'll calm down</b>
<b>old Mrs Molinari.</b>
<b>She's basically a good woman.</b>
<b>Ijust need to write a report.</b>
<b>- Do you need to come inside?</b>
<b>-Yes, please.</b>
<b>-Would you like something to drink?</b>
<b>- I shouldn't,</b>
<b>but I don't consider myself</b>
<b>to be in service</b>
<b>when I'm dealing with cats.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Here.</b>
<b>To your health, madam.</b>
<b>And to the cat's.</b>
<b>-That's him, isn't it?</b>
<b>-Yes.</b>
<b>Did you hear that?</b>
<b>The cat's realised</b>
<b>we're here about him.</b>
<b>Bloody animal! I, I...</b>
<b>I'm scared of him, believe me inspector.</b>
<b>No, don't bother...</b>
<b>Seems to be coming</b>
<b>from that door.</b>
<b>Yes, the cellar.</b>
<b>But it's always closed.</b>
<b>No, it's open.</b>
<b>If we find him,</b>
<b>-we'll take him away for you.</b>
<b>- No, no,</b>
<b>my husband's very fond of him.</b>
<b>He'd get angry if the cat was</b>
<b>gone when he returned.</b>
<b>He sounds injured from</b>
<b>the way he's miaowing,</b>
<b>we'd better take a look.</b>
<b>He's not here.</b>
<b>Stuff from '48.</b>
<b>Barolo, Merlot,</b>
<b>CEabernet,</b>
<b>a Brunello from '36.</b>
<b>There's no cat, but the miaowing</b>
<b>came from here.</b>
<b>This is worth a fortune.</b>
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>I know nothing about wine.</b>
<b>- Found anything?</b>
<b>- No,</b>
<b>I'd say he's not here.</b>
<b>I'd be delighted if you</b>
<b>accepted at least one.</b>
<b>Oh, no, that's too generous, madam!</b>
<b>- And maybe your husband...</b>
<b>- ...he will be happy.</b>
<b>- Please take it.</b>
<b>-Well, how could I refuse?</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>There's a hole in the wall here!</b>
<b>It looks like it's been</b>
<b>dug from inside,</b>
<b>and the plaster's new.</b>
<b>He's in there,</b>
<b>he's in there!</b>
<b>That bloody animal's in there!!</b>
<b>Madam!</b>
<b>Madam, don't over-react, please.</b>
<b>He wants me dead.</b>
<b>He wants to destroy me!</b>
<b>That demon is...</b>
<b>Satan!!</b>
<b>Satan!!!</b>
