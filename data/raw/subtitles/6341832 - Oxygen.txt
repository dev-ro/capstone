- [Moreau] I need you to think.
What are you hiding from me?
What's going on?
[Moreau] Try to focus, please.
You're not telling me the truth.
Tell me.
[sobs] You know where I am
and won't tell me, is that it?

[Moreau] You played basketball.
What?
[Moreau] At college. You were gifted.
I thought you'd like
to hear something about yourself
and during my search, that struck me.
[faint chatter in background]
Basketball?
[Moreau] Yes.
It stood out from the rest.
Doctorate in bio-engineering,
grants, awards.
You are impressive.
Does it ring a bell?
No.

Answer me, please.
You're in a cryogenic unit, is that right?
You called me,
but you were looking for Léo.
Listen, we don't have much time.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Something must have gone wrong.
- I want to talk to Léo.

You must listen to me. I can help you.
I won't listen until I speak to Léo.

MILO, unlock.
[MILO] Unlocking activated.
[woman] Please, no. You'll die.
I can prove it.
If you open the unit, you'll die.
MILO, pause unlocking.
You have ten seconds.
[woman] Thank you, thank you.
Just let me explain.
- Eight seconds.
- [woman] Okay, okay!
Go to "system preferences."
Find the centrifuge controls.
- System preferences.
- [woman] Please. Just let me explain.
Centrifuge controls.
Got them.
[woman] It's set at one. Switch to...
Switch to what?
[woman] This isn't
how you should find out.
[yelling] Switch to what?
MILO…
[woman] Zero. Switch to zero.
- Switch to zero.
- [alert beeping]
[woman] Please, Liz. Don't do it.
[MILO] Turning off microthrusters.
[woman] I'm sorry, Liz. I really am.
- [metal thuds]
- [Liz gasps]
[MILO] Alert, lengthy exposure
to weightlessness
can be harmful to the bioform.
[Liz gasps]
[woman] Liz.
[ethereal music playing]
Liz!
Where am I?
[woman] Around 40,389 miles from Earth.
No, no, no.
No.
MILO, distance from Earth?
[MILO] 42,735 miles.
That's not possible.
[woman] Sorry, Liz. But time is limited.
You'll soon be beyond the range
of our communication satellites.
[chiming]
- [MILO] Centrifuge rotation launched.
- [Liz grunts]
[MILO] G-1 launched. Oxygen level, 13%.
[woman] Liz, please.
You were placed in hypersleep
to allow you to carry out your mission.
But something went wrong.
I can't bring you home.
But I designed the system,
and maybe we could
put you back into hypersleep.
It would give you a chance. Please.
What mission?
[woman] If we can locate the damage,
divert the affected systems…
What mission?
[woman] Colonizing a planet
orbiting around Wolf 10-61,
fourteen light-years from Earth.
But you only just left.
Your HIVE transporter hasn't yet engaged
its nuclear-powered thrust.
No, no, no, no, no…
[woman] Liz, we have to act fast.
This isn't real.
- [Liz breathing heavily]
- [ethereal music playing]
Was it a military operation?
Do I work for the Ministry of Defense?
[woman] Yes. Do you remember?
Why the army?
[woman] The human race
will die out in two generations.
That can't be made public.
Did he know?
[woman] Who?
That guy. Moreau.
When I asked for help, he was kind,
- but he was lying to me, right?
- [woman] Liz. He had no choice.
As soon as the police
looked for information about you,
the Ministry got involved.
Everything said after that
was only what they wanted you to hear.
But why?
If I was a key part of the project,
why not just tell me the truth?
[woman] The fog of memory.
It was impossible to foresee your reaction
or the memories that would return first.
You're a threat.
Speak to the wrong person,
and it all goes public.
General panic, chaos.
They couldn't take that risk.
I thought he was doing this to me,
that he was holding me.
He didn't tell me Léo was dead,
he said he wasn't real.
Liz, everything, I mean everything,
everything was done
from the moment they realized
you'd regained consciousness
to prevent you
from recovering your memory.
So he was playing for time.
He was waiting…
He was waiting
for me to run out of oxygen.
[inhaling deeply]
Léo was real…
and he's dead.
[woman] Yes.
[sighs]
Twelve percent. Twelve percent.
[woman] We're running out of time.
What happened to him?
[woman] He was sick.
Léo got sick, like millions of others
who were killed by the virus.
Liz?
No, no, no. That doesn't add up.
They said I went missing three days ago.
You've been in hypersleep
much longer than that.
How long?
How long?
[woman] Twelve years.
I'm really sorry, Liz.
[Liz gasping]
You're wasting your time and your oxygen.
In ten minutes, you'll be out of range,
and we won't be able to communicate.
Either you die alone,
or you help me to solve the problem
- and give yourself a chance.
- No.
- [woman] I know what I'd choose.
- Okay, okay, okay.
[Liz sighs]
Where do we begin?
[woman] Okay, first we need
to figure out what woke you up.
MILO, why was the bioform awakened?
[MILO] Processor 3-54 overheating
due to loss of oxygen reserves.
What is processor 3-54 used for?
[MILO] Processor 3-54 monitors and
stimulates the subject's cerebral activity
to avoid cellular atrophy.
Brain atrophy. You hear that?
I could do without that, personally.
[woman] I agree.
We must divert
the cerebral activity monitor
to another processor
assigned to non-essential functions.
MILO, list all the processors
linked to non-essential functions.
[beeping]
[MILO] All functions assigned
to processor 694.
Is there any danger to the bioform
if all functions of processor 694
are deactivated?
[MILO] Zero danger for the bioform.
So, go on. Go on, deactivate them.
Deactivation underway.
[machines powering down]
MILO, transfer all functions
of processor 3-54 to 694.
[MILO] The data exceeds
processor capacity.
Damn.
Shit.
What do we do now?
[woman] We have to make
some difficult choices now.
Deactivate systems
that don't have priority.
- Find... Too late! They're here!
- [clatter on phone]
- Find a way to install a shunt...
- What do you mean, "they're here"?
[woman] Return to hypersleep.
But do it before the oxygen hits 2%,
or you won't have enough
for resuscitation.
But I won't know how to do it.
[woman] You do know.
You have all the answers.
Figure out what triggers your memories,
then you'll find those you need.
- You designed it. I won't know how.
- [loud banging on phone]
[man] On the ground!
- Hello?
- [man 1] Right now!
- [man 2] No.
- Hello?
- [woman] Find what triggers your memories.
- [man] Get on the floor!
- [woman] Two percent! Find Léo!
- [man] On the floor, I said!
- [woman muffled] Find Léo!
- [feedback whining]
[MILO] Connection lost.
[wincing loudly]
Shit, shit, shit. MILO, reconnect.
[recording] This number is unassigned.
Please check the number.
Don't leave me alone, please.
[panting slowly]
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay. I worked on this thing.
I worked on it.
MILO, who authorized Omicron 267's
participation in this mission?
[MILO] Participation of Omicron 267
authorized by Hansen, Elizabeth, doctor.
[laughs]
Yeah, of course.
So that's me. That's me.
It's me, it's me.
A thing only I know. Only I know.
"Find Léo, find Léo."
What does "find Léo" mean?
[mutters] What does it mean?
[yelling] What does it mean,
damn it, "find Léo?"
What does it mean?
How do I do it? How do I do it?
- [alert beeping]
- [MILO] Oxygen level, 11%.
[eerie music playing]
Okay, okay. Think.
MILO, show me all low-priority processors.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
Too many. There are too many.
Explain kinetic regulation.
[MILO] Kinetic regulation delivers
weak electric impulses to muscle groups
to prevent atrophy.
Okay. And if we deactivate it,
what happens?
[MILO] Degeneration of muscular tissue.
And that's considered low priority, right?
[MILO] Yes, because the bioform
would survive the journey.
To die on being resuscitated.
[MILO] The bioform would survive
between three hours and ten days.
MILO, limit results to
only processes that can be interrupted
without reducing life expectancy.
[MILO] No non-priority processes
can be interrupted
without reducing life expectancy.
Difficult choices.
Find what triggers the memories.
Come on, come on.
If you have something to say,
now's the time.
[wincing]
[dramatic music playing]
I'm out of my mind.
[MILO] Warning, any deliberate damage
to a Cryosalide unit
is a European federal offense
punishable by ten years imprisonment.
So go on, electrocute me.
- [electricity crackling]
- Ahh!
[MILO] Warning. Warning.
- [crackling]
- Ahh!
[groans]
[MILO] Warning.
- [crackling]
- Ahh!
[panting]
[MILO] Warning.
- [crackling]
- Ahh!
[Léo softly] Don't you worry.
We'll meet again.
[wistful music playing]
[Léo] And that's our entry system.
[Liz] MILO, search for Alice Hansen
in Paris.
[MILO] One result.
Call that contact.
[MILO] No network detected.
Amplify transmission.
[MILO] Transmission amplified.
Attempted connection.

[woman distorted] Hello?
Mom?
[Alice] Sweetheart? Is that you?
Oh, what's wrong?
[Liz] I think…
[Alice distorted] What? I can't hear you…
[static]
I just wanted to hear your voice.
[Alice] Liz, my love, what's going on?
I don't think anyone will come.
[Alice] Who won't come? Is everything all…
[static]
I tried to find him.
I don't know where else to look.
I'm supposed to know, but I don't.
[Alice distorted] Why didn't you come
to see me on Sunday?
It's not good for you,
being alone in that house.
I'll come to see you.
No, even better, you come here.
Spend a little time with me.
He won't tell me what to do.
[Alice distorted] Are you in a car?
I can hardly hear you.
No, I… I'm in…
[Alice] What?
You shouldn't call while driving.
[static whining]
[sobs] I'm in…
[Alice] Are you there? Liz…
I love you, Mom.
[crying softly]
[Alice distorted] I can't hear…
what… saying…
I was saying I love you.

[MILO] No network detected.
[alert beeping]
[MILO] Alert. Oxygen level, 6%.
MILO, how long will Omicron 267 live
once the oxygen runs out?
Omicron 267 will live for approximately
three minutes once the oxygen runs out.
- [sighs]
- [eerie music playing]
- [object thudding]
- [gasps]
[metal creaking]
And how long will Omicron 267 live
during decompression in outer space?
[MILO] It is estimated
that the subject should remain conscious.
for between nine and 11 seconds,
during which extreme pain will be felt.
[alert beeping]
Oxygen level, 5%.
[alert continues beeping]
MILO, unlock.

MILO…
MILO, how many Omicron units are there?
[MILO] There are 10,000 Omicron units.
Where are they located?
[MILO] Impossible to determine
the units' location.
Specify variables.
In relation to Omicron 267...
- Can you turn off that alarm?
- [beeping stops]
[MILO] All units are located within
a radius of 173 feet of Omicron 267.
Can I get a visual?
Visual already created.
No. I want a visual of the other units.
Visual of the cryogenic units
already established.
MILO, I don't see anything.
[MILO] Human visualization capacity
hampered by photochromic UV filtration.
Deactivate filtration.
[screaming]
[panting]
[dramatic music playing]
[dramatic music continues]
[MILO] Prolonged exposure to UV rays
could harm the bioform.
Filtration activated.
How many units are still operational?
[MILO] 9,567 are fully operational.
433 have been lost.
Is this unit considered lost?
[MILO] Omicron 267 status, lost.
How many woke up in lost units?
[MILO] I don't understand the question.
How many woke up, you bastard?
How many are waiting to die?
[MILO] I don't understand the question.
How many have you trapped?
[MILO] I don't understand the question.
[angrily] MILO, how many
bioforms have revived in lost units?
[MILO] One. Omicron 267.
[breathes deeply] And the others?
[MILO] They expired
in the collision with asteroid X375.
Is Léo on board?
[MILO] I don't understand the term "Léo."
Can you show me the interior of the units?
- [MILO] Affirmative.
- Go on.
Limit the search to the men.
There are too many.
[MILO] Alert. Oxygen level, 4%.
No, I don't have time.
I don't have time for this.
Seventeen.

Seventeen. Seventeen.
No, that's not it.
267.
MILO, is unit 42 still operational?
[MILO] Unit 42 is fully operational.
Can you show me the bioform?
Can you uncover his face?
[MILO] Omicron 42 is enveloped
in the organic cocoon
for reasons of preservation.
Can you remove it
without damaging the bioform?
[MILO] The cocoon is self-regenerating.
So open it and show me his face.
Can you uncover his face?
You're alive. [laughs]
You're alive.
Liars. All liars.
Where's his scar? Why doesn't he have his…
Why…
Why is it gone? It's not possible.
MILO.
MILO, do another search
for Elizabeth Hansen.
[beeping]
[MILO] There are
1,292 academic articles including...
Videos. Show me videos.
MEMORY TRANSFER
"Memory transfer."
Play the video.
[woman] Numerous attempts
at memory transfer have taken place.
But the scientific community
has given up pursuing this goal,
the general consensus
being that memory transfer is impossible.
That didn't stop me.
I developed
an offensive personality transfer in rats.
This fresh approach provided
the necessary framework for success.
As emotions are chemical surges
taking place in the body
in reaction to experiences,
they are coded
in the form of muscular memory.
A little like water records the size,
shape, and speed of a stone that falls
in the form of undulations.
By stimulating the original muscles
to kindle the memories,
the undulations were recorded
with a liquid polymer, then archived.
We thus transform the data into experience
and make the reproduction identical…
to the original.
Down to the smallest memory.
And our rat, despite never having
explored this maze…
- That's not possible.
- [woman] …already knows the way out.
[dramatic music playing]
MILO, how old is Omicron 267?
[MILO] Omicron 267 is 12 years, 42 days,
17 hours, and 56 minutes old.
Can you play back the last transmission?
[Alice] Hello?
No. Not that one.
The one before that.
[woman] I can help you. No one else
can help you at this point, Liz.
[Liz] How do you know my name?
I never told you.
[woman] No need. I knew who you were
the moment I heard your voice,
even though I couldn't believe it.
Stop. Can you do voice recognition
of the person who called me?
[MILO] Voice recognition underway.
Call made by Hansen Elizabeth, doctor,
born January 3, 2003 in Stockholm, Sweden.
[mysterious music playing]
[Liz] I'm you.
I'm you in a box.
MILO.
What is Omicron 267?
[MILO] Omicrons are non-contaminated
genetic human reproductions
designed to propagate
the human race on Wolf-10-61c.
I'm a clone.
I'm a fucking clone. [laughing]
[yelling] I'm a fucking clone!
I've never been outside this box!
I'm disposable!
I'm space waste!
[screaming]
I don't wanna die!
- [Liz sobbing]
- [banging]
[sobbing and banging continues]
Why did you do this to me?
[sobbing]
[MILO] Oxygen level
approaching critical threshold.
[alert beeping]
MILO, record a message for Omicron 42.
[MILO] Recording activated.
Léo…
If you get this message,
it means you made it, and I…
I ran out of time.
I have the memory
of a whole life with you.
I feel I know your laugh, your smell…
I remember that
we were trying to have children…
that we didn't have any
because it wasn't reasonable.
[sobs]
But it's crazy because I feel that
like a gap inside of me.
It's absurd.
Because we don't know each other.
I've never touched you. I've never…
smelled you…
I know our life by heart
although I've never lived it.
[exhales] Well, this life…
This life of…
- MILO, how long have I been awake?
- 102 minutes.
Yes, this life of 102 minutes…
Well, I'm on my way out, and…
be happy.
I just want to…
I just want to…
I want to live.
I want to live. I want to live.
I want to live.
MILO!
MILO, show me
those low-priority processors again.
Sorry, but…
I may be genetically designed to love you,
but, in fact, I don't know you.
We'll have a drink together when…
when I'm over all of this.
[MILO] Alert. Oxygen level, 3%.

Would you like a sedative?
You need my authorization for a sedative,
but not for a lethal injection?
Are you still recording the message?
[MILO] Yes. I am still recording
a message for Omicron 42.
Léo, can you hear what I'm forced
to put up with? I mean, seriously…
MILO, which processor controls
the euthanasia protocols?
[MILO] Processor 67-526
is assigned to all disaster scenarios.
All scenarios
where you're supposed to kill me?
- [MILO] Yes.
- Deactivate it.
[MILO] Deactivation of disaster scenarios
is contrary to the United Nations ruling
concerning the Ethics of Medical Practice.
In other words, if we deactivate,
you won't be able to kill me,
even if I beg you to?
[MILO] Affirmative.
Okay. Deactivate them.
And redirect
all remaining functions of processor 3-54.
Deactivation of disaster scenarios.
[chiming and beeping]
All functions
of processor 3-54 are now reassigned.
Okay. Launch the return
to hypersleep protocol for the bioform.
Implementation impossible,
bioform disconnected.
Intravenous assistance unhooked.
Medical umbilical ring unhooked.
Cerebral activity unhooked.
Okay. Think.
Think of the easiest thing.
Does the bioform need two IVs?
[MILO] Affirmative. P1 for nutriments,
P2 for hypersleep management.
Oxygen level critical.
[menacing music playing]
[Liz screaming]
[rats chittering]
It's going to go away.
It's not real.

[MILO] No. An oxygen level of 2%
is the strict minimum for resuscitation.
I imagine the promise was that
we'd wake together,
but I won't be there.
I've tried everything.
I'm not the only one lost…
I'm not the only one lost,
there are others.
There are others.
MILO, end of recording.
[MILO] Recording ended.
Goodbye, Léo.
[somber music playing]
[MILO] Oxygen level, 0.6%.
[gasps] The others!
MILO, how much oxygen
is left in the lost units?
[MILO] 187 lost units
are at full capacity.
Divert the oxygen
from the lost units to unit 267.
[MILO] Diversion impossible
to carry out now.
Access to individual oxygen reserves
is limited for security reasons.
It will require
approximately 14,227 minutes
to ignore the security restriction.
It is recommended
placing the bioform in hypersleep
for reasons
of preservation during the maneuver.
Can you do that, MILO?
[MILO] Do you want to begin
the return to hypersleep protocol
while I carry out the maneuver?
[laughs]
Yes.
[crying] I could kiss you right now. Yes.
Launch the hypersleep protocol.
[MILO] Return to hypersleep

Would you like a sedative?
[sobbing] Yes.
[MILO] Administration underway.
Initialization of cryoprotector
transfusion for vitrification.
Security lock bypass launched.
Body temperature, 37.1 degrees Celsius.
MILO, I'm sorry for hitting you.
[MILO] Apology accepted.
MILO, tell me about the planet.
What's it like?
[MILO] Wolf 10-61c
has an orbital cycle of 18 days.
Its mass is around four times
that of Earth.
Its lack of rotation makes life impossible
on its sun-facing side, which is too hot,
and on its dark side, which is too cold.
The habitable area is therefore
on the border of day and night.
Tell me about the journey.
[MILO] Once nuclear-powered thrust
is engaged,
it will take 34 years
to cover the 14 light-years
between us and Wolf 10-61c.
On arrival, the Hive sowing vessel
will break up to free the 9,568 units
that will enter
the atmosphere of Wolf 10-61c.
Thanks to their
individual helix-shaped device...
MILO, tell me about the beach in Maui.
[MILO] Kapalua Bay is a white sand beach
in the shape of a crescent moon
situated in the north-west of the island.
It is protected by two coral reefs.
The aquatic bioforms include
butterflyfish, parrotfish,
damselfish, blue surgeonfish,
Moorish idols, Achille tangs,
wrasses, yellow boxfish,
bluefish, triggerfish, yellowfin goatfish,
porcupinefish,
crevalle jacks, trumpetfish…
