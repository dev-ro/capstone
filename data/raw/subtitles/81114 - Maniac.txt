[TV: Helicopter Whirring] [TV: Male Reporter]... what
happened at the governor's mansion in Albany yesterday
This is George Garrison
from On The Spot News.
Right now, we are live
over midtown Manhattan.
bringing you the latest update on one of the most
violent killing sprees in our city's history.
Following yesterday's brutal slaying of a
young couple under the Verrazano Bridge,
New York City Police Commissioner Paul Delaney
has assigned a special task force...
of over two dozen detectives to join in on the manhunt for
a madman who has left five dead in the metropolitan area.
The peculiar yet brutal
disfigurement of the bodies...
has led police to believe that one man
is responsible for the killings.
50 ﬂair, witnesses are few,
and detectives are stumped for clues.
Back in local politics,
Assemblyman Anthony Ventura-
You tell me what I should do.
I heard about it.
I always do.
I can't go out for a minute.
[Sighs]
it's impossible.
Fancy girls...
and their fancy dresses
and their lipstick...
laughing and dancing.
But you stop them, don't you?
I can't stop 'em.
But you do, don't you?
[Sighs]
Then they can't laugh,
and they can't dance any more.
So you got to stop,
or they'll take you away from me.
[Sighs]
I won't ever...
let them take you away from me.
You're mine now forever-
[Sobbing]
and I'm so happy.
[Sobbing Continues]

And, uh, I got on TV.
[Laughing]
Denise, be careful.
Don't swing so high.
Okay I won't.
All of my friends
were so surprised.
Denise,
you wanna ride our bikes?
My mother said
I can't leave the park.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Okay.

Well, here's the newspaper, if you
wanna read it while you're waiting.
Are you sure you don't need it?
I wanna check my horoscope.
No, I already read it
this afternoon on my break.
Oh, I hate reading the newspapers these days
with that kook running around. Yuck.
I know. That guy's really a sicko.
I hope they catch him soon.
Yeah- Oh, be sure and check Mr. Gannon's I.V.

He, uh, pulled it out
again tonight.
Not again.
He's too much!
I will. I'm so cold. [Sighs]

Who is it?
Yes, uh, my name is Frank Zito.
You took my picture in the park.
May I speak with you?
Come in.
That's- That's amazing.
I was just looking at a photo
I took of you in the park.
Really? Well, uh, it's a coincidence, because
what I wanted to, uh, speak to you about-
Do you mind if I take a look?
Certainly.
[Paper Rustling]
[Footsteps]
Oh, great.
Here you are.
Thanks.
Listen, um-
Listen, how come
all your models are women?
Well, it's just something
I'm interested in as a woman.
In fact, this is my fourth series.
It's called Woman Four.
Mm-hmm.
Not very original, is it?
Well, it's not the title
that matters that much.
No. No.
Listen, do you get to, uh,
keep them all?
I'm hoping to sell them.
I wouldn't. I-I'd keep 'em forever.
But Why?
I mean, part of my profession
is to sell photographs.
It's not all for art's sake, you know.
I know, but why do you take pictures
of women this way?
I like to make them look beautiful.
No. I think it's more
to preserve them.
You see, the beauty
is already in the model.
Frank, don't be silly.
Listen, I'm the photographer, right?
Right.
[Chuckles] So I should know
what I'm doing, shouldn't I?
I know, but to me, you know,
things change, people die.
But in a painting or a picture,
they're yours forever.
There's no way you can
possess someone forever,
even in a photograph.
There's no way.
Well, I was noticing this picture
of this old lady here.
At one point in her life,
she was someone's sister,
someone's wife, someone's mother.
And when the photographer took her picture,
he had her the way he wanted her.
She could never leave him.
She couldn't grow old,
and she couldn't die.
Tell me, Frank.
What do you do for a living?
Um, I'm a painter.
Yeah?
Abstracts, some still lifes, some landscapes.
You know, things like that.
I'd love to see some of your work
sometime.
You would?
I'd love to, yes.
Listen, uh, Anna,
I know this place over
in New Jersey, you know?
Yeah?
Clams Casino.
Italian food.
Mm-hmm.
[Chuckling]
And, uh-
Would you like to have dinner?
Why, Frank,
are you asking me for a date?
You talkin' to me?
I'm talking to you.
I'd love to, yes.
I really would.
- Give me five minutes, and I'll be right with you.
- Great.
jj [Background Piano, Romantic]
jj, [Man Singing In Italian] You're the
most beautiful woman I've seen since, uh, my mom.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thanks.
Have you got a picture of her?
Yeah.
Mmm.
Here. it's when she was younger.
Oh, right.
Tell me, where does she live?
Oh, we lived in Queens, but, uh,
my mother was taken from me...
in an automobile accident
when I was younger.
I'm sorry.
She really was lovely.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm, it's a shame.
Listen, Frank.
What?
Rita's coming to the loft
tonight at 9:00,
and I want to get
all the work finished.
So she promised me
she'd work overtime.
So, in other words, it's an early night.
Is that it?
It is really.
Well, as long as I can
see you again, I mean-
Yes, of course.
Great.
What about tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night?
Let's see if I'm booked. [Laughs]
No, of course tomorrow night
would be great.
But I know you're very busy, and I'm
sure that, uh, something will come up.
I might be and, then again,
I might not be.
Oh, but I'll definitely see you
on Thursday at the show.
No kidding.
You'll be there.
Yes, and so will
five million other guys.
Oh, Frank.
What?
Are you annoyed?
No.
I mean, that would be ridiculous,
wouldn't it?
Yes, it would.
Mr. Steiner's doing this-
He's having this really big celebration.
He's asked all these people
from Art World down,
and it- it could be something
really special for me.
I understand.
I wish you the best of luck, Anna.
I know you do. Yeah.
