was when you got married to Zhang Xi.
You haven't been ill for ages.
How come you've suddenly got a cough?
Only dead people don't get sick.
How could dead people ever get sick?
The electricity is finally back.
Three times a day.
The electricity goes off three times a day?
I mean take these pills three times a day.
I thought you meant the blackouts.
Don't forget!
Okay.
Damn it!
Pisshead's dog is always coming in here!
Is there some festival on today?
It's just another normal day.
I'd rest for a couple days.
You're not looking well at all.
Okay.
The Buddha told Subhati,
"I know the mind of every sentient being
in all the host of universes,
"regardless of any modes of thought,
conceptions or tendencies.
"For all modes, conceptions
and tendencies of thought are not mind.
"And yet they are called 'mind.'
"Why?
"It is impossible to retain a past thought,
"to seize a future thought,
"and even to hold onto a present thought."

When will the bananas arrive today?
Why don't you throw down
a bottle of liquor for me?
Leave now, or the wild caveman
will come and get you.
You have to believe me.
The wild man has caught Weiwei.
What?
Thank you for watching the program today.
As usual, we now have Chen Sheng with us
to read one of his poems.
Chen Sheng is a doctor
working in a clinic in Kaili.
The poems he writes in his spare time

Chen!
I heard you on TV just now.
- Where's your dad?
- He's gone to the stall.
Why did he lock you in?
He told me to stay in and do my homework.
Guess what?
Pisshead gave me a real fright this morning.
I'll show him.
Why did he come here to frighten you?
He said a wild man was coming to get me.
There's no wild man.
He was just trying to frighten you.
Oh.
Chen! You know how to pick a lock?
Who changed the lock?
My dad did.
Where did you learn how to pick a lock?
You talk too much! Are you hungry?
Yes.
Any food at home?
Dad made noodles this morning
but I don't want them.
What do you want to eat then?
Rice noodles.
Let's go and eat then.
Chen, I lost my ball.
Where is it?
In the river.
I'll buy you a new one.
Stop calling me Chen! I'm your uncle!
Chen, your car can never
catch up with mine.
Sit tight or you'll fall off. We're moving now.
One, two, three,
four, five...
Ten yuan.
Call!
Chen Sheng's here with your son.
Call!
What are they doing here?
Dad!
Good for nothing kid!
Didn't I tell you to stay at home
and watch TV?
There's only one channel.
And the show was all about wild men.
So I got scared.
You'll have to play without me.
How come you changed the lock?
I'm asking you why you changed the lock.
Too many robbers about.
Weiwei says you're moving house
next month?
You're going to move house
next month, aren't you?
You got in even after I changed the lock.
How can I stay there?
Weiwei can come and live with me then.
No need for that.

Goodbye, Journey, Mistress

You're early today! Had breakfast yet?
Yes. What took you so long?
What a brave boy you are!
No crying whatsoever.
What's wrong with him?
I made you better the other day.
What's wrong with you this time?
What a brave boy you are! You'll be fine.
I'll do it.
Take him in there.
Don't cry, don't cry.
It's okay, it's okay.
Settle down, settle down.
What made you put the radio on today?
I found it at home but it was broken.
It's all right. No need to cry.
You'll be fine.
It's okay, it's okay.
Finished?
Three times a day for the bigger box
and twice a day for the smaller one.
Give them to him with warm water
after his meals.
Just follow the instructions.
Okay. If he's still not better
I'll bring him back
and put him on a drip again.
Yeah.
Take care! Bye bye, little man!
Did you put that box outside?
Yes. It collapsed as I pulled it out.
There were old firecrackers inside.
I bought the firecrackers
for when I visited my son's grave.
They don't let you set off firecrackers or
burn paper money these days.
Has burning paper money been banned too?
I had a dream last night.
I dreamed of a friend.
We lost touch
during the Cultural Revolution.
I came to Kaili and he stayed
in Zhenyuan alone.
Your lover?
What?
But his name was Airen,
which means, "lover."
He knew I couldn't stand the cold.
But we didn't have any money.
No heating or anything else
to keep us warm.
So, he got an electric torch out of his pocket
and pressed it against my hands
to warm me up.
Did it warm you up?
Of course not! It was just a torch.
Then what happened?
Many years later,
he came to Kaili and gave me a tape.
After that we lost touch.
But we promised each other
whoever left first would buy
the other person a new shirt.
I left for Kaili, but I forgot.
I never bought him a new shirt.
I'll take the recorder home and fix it for you.
That chicken you brought me
will go off soon.
It's still in my fridge.
You should come over and we'll cook it.
Okay, I'll come over in the next few days.
Weiwei!
Weiwei! Time for your bath.
I don't want a bath.
Hurry up!
Look at you, you filthy pig.
Get a move on!
I don't want a bath.
Lift up your arms.
Look at that drawing on your wrist!
Is that supposed to be a watch?
Do you want to look like a gangster?
Excuse me! Where's your boss?
Over there.
Over there?
Hi, boss, Monk sent me
to fetch the motorcycle.
Follow me.
- Here you are.
- Which one is it?
- That one?
- This one.
This one!
Okay.
- Have you finished your homework?
- Yes.
Look, I've got a watch. Do you want it?
How many watches do you have at home?
Plenty. Come to my house and you'll see.
He's got a whole room full of them.
Do you want to go to his house and play?
Yeah.
You can go for a few days then.
Wild men footprints,
around three times the size
of a normal human foot,
have once again been found
in the Kaili region.
The remains of dead sheep, a cow and other
animals were also found in the vicinity.
The last time a wild man was sighted
in Kaili was nine years ago
and the incident led to a traffic accident.
The driver of the car said that
he saw a wild man sitting in the back seat
through his rear-view mirror.
The man had brown hair all over his body,
he had shiny eyes,
and his voice was like the roar of thunder.
"Without music, the ears go deaf
"Without rules, candles go out
"Just as people once believed that
photographs could steal the soul,
"You took a photo and stole my soul
"Without razors, language becomes muted
"Yet I have lived without
a heart for nine years"
I've been dreaming of my mother
a lot these days.
All I can see is the flower embroidery
on her shoes.
But I can't see her.
And I could hear the sound
of Lusheng pipes.
As I came out of my dream,
I saw lots of Miao people
walking around me.
I felt awful.
Once I woke up, I felt fine.
You should go and visit your mum's grave.
Burn some paper money for her
when no one is watching.
I'm glad this old house
is going to be torn down.
I always have dreams when I sleep here.
It's really unsettling.
Don't blame the house.
I dream a lot, too.
I dreamed of my son.
He was riding his new motorbike.
That batik he went to collect from your mum
was covered in blood from his hands.
If I'd known, I would have told her
not to make the batik.
Back in the days
when I was out on the streets,
there was this gang member we called Monk.
His son was buried alive.
After that, his son often appeared
in his dreams asking for a watch.
So, he burned an image
of a watch for his son.
But his son still appeared in his dreams.
In the end, he decided to open
a watch shop in Zhenyuan.
Maybe we opened this clinic
for the same reason.
Did you burn that batik for him, then?
No. I couldn't bear to part with it.
Not much use keeping it either.
It's something to remember him by.
Sooner or later,
the patients we treat just get ill again.
What's the point in doctors like us
busying about all the time?
Hello? Hello?
Let's take a break.
Hasn't the medicine worked?
Not really.
I think we should go home soon.
Sing a song for us!
Are you joking?
- I just want to hear you sing, that's all.
- I can't sing.
Zhang Xi also wants to hear your sing.
When have you ever heard me sing?
- Come on, come on.
- Leave him alone.
Any bananas left today?
Sold out. Come again tomorrow.
You mind letting me past?
- I'll be back in a few days.
- Okay.
Get down from there! Come on!
Stop it! Look at you!
You're completely hammered again.
Get down now or I'll drive your car away.
You're wasted again aren't you?
Get out of here!
We're sorry.
Your phone has run out of credit.
Please top up soon. Thank you!
Chen, Crazy Face has just arrived.
Why didn't you tell me
you changed the tombstone?
Why didn't you tell me
you changed the tombstone?
It's none of your business.
She's my mother too, you know.
What do you mean
it's none of my business?
What right do you have to claim
to be her son?
You don't give a shit about Weiwei.
He doesn't even know
where his next meal will come from.
All you do is fuck about the whole time.
"Fuck about"? He's my son!
What's it to do with you?
What business is it of yours if I sell the kid?
Which one of you is Xu Ying?
Which one of you is Xu Ying?
Why do you ask?
I want some answers.
Did you chop off Monk's son's hand?
I thought he died ages ago.
He still owes me 400,000.
I handled the whole hand-chopping
incident, didn't I?
And I lost 400,000.
Was it your idea to cutoff
Monk's son's hand?
"Mountains

Go back to your casino
and mind your own business!
You're not making business
easy for me, are you?
Wait up, Chen!
I've been involved
in some dodgy dealings lately.
So I didn't dare call you.
Just stay out of my business.
Come on!
San!
Go and play over there.
Come and have a drink with me.
Stop thinking about it.
Keep it down over there, will you!
Come on!
Your mum had a long chat with me
before she passed away.
She said she was sorry she left you
in Zhenyuan all by yourself
when you were a kid...
Why are you telling me all this?
Crazy Face is your half-brother, after all.
Poor little Weiwei!
I've got to go.
I'll call you later.
- Which one is Crazy Face's motorbike?
- That one.
Who did you sell Weiwei to?
I didn't want to make you lose face
in front of everyone last night.
You just try messing with me again.
Who did you sell Weiwei to?
What's it to you?
What kind of a man are you?
You're one to talk.
Where were you when mum died?
I was there till the very end.
But in the end, you still got the house!
All you can think about is the house.
I'll give you the house.
Just tell me where Weiwei is.
Where's Weiwei?
It's not yours to give.
That house should be mine.
You were in jail all those years.
I took care of everything.
Tell me where Weiwei is.
You'll get the house,
and Weiwei can live with me.
The area we live in
is going to be torn down soon.
When I find Weiwei, the house is yours.
You have my word.
How on earth could I sell him at his age?
Monk took him on a trip to Zhenyuan.
Don't stand on the scales.
I'm trying to work.
Sorry.
That friend I dreamt about last time.
He told his son to call me, to say
he was very ill and wanted to see me.
Are you going to see him?
I can't go at my age.
It'll just make me upset
seeing him sick like that.
You sound upset now.
You're already upset.
Not as upset as I would be if I saw him.
I'm going to Zhenyuan in a few days.
- I need to take a few days off.
- You're going to Zhenyuan?
Yeah, I've got something to do there.
When you go would you give him
something for me?
What exactly?
This shirt.
This is Lin Airen.
This was taken when he was young.
He probably doesn't look like this anymore.
This tape is for him, too.
He lives in Zhenyuan.
It won't be hard to find him.
Tell him it's from Guanglian.
And tell him to take good care of himself
and that I wish him a speedy recovery.
Okay.
I'll eat that fish when I get back.
Living alone, I've never needed a fridge.
I live alone, too.
You can just leave it in my fridge.

"All silently turns to darkness

What are you doing here?
I was late.
When I left, none of you were there.
- So, I came here to rest for a bit.
- Let's go.
You can go home and shower
and change into some fresh clothes.
Let me take that.
What's inside?
- It's really heavy.
- Books.
I'll drive.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Of course, I'm sure.
Last month,
a very strange car accident happened
when a man driving a white pick-up truck
ran over and killed a young man
riding a bicycle in front of him.
In his hand was a Miao minority batik.
The driver, who was drunk
at the time of the accident,
told the police he had seen
a wild man in the back seat.
He said the man had brown hair
all over his body, with shiny eyes,
and his voice was like the roar of thunder.
One day I was down
in the mine digging for coal.
I was so exhausted
I took the shuttle car up to the surface.
According to prison rules,
if you get caught taking the shuttle car
you lose all the points you'd normally get
for the coal you've dug that day.
They're really tough with the rules
because lots of people have died
taking the shuttle car.
I was unlucky that day.
I got caught by the warden
right after getting in.
We called him Master Wang.
I begged him not to tell on me.
I said, "Old Master,
please let me off this once.
"I only did it because I was exhausted.
"Don't report me, please!
"If you report me, I've had it."
He didn't say anything.
So, I assumed I'd gotten away with it.
But once I'd had a shower
and something to eat,
two team leaders came.
They took me to an office
and gave me such a beating.
It was only towards the end
of my prison term
that I found out that once upon a time,
the locals didn't know how to fuck.
They learnt how to shag
by observing how the dogs did it.
So, the locals all called the dogs,
"Old Masters."
Chen, I owe you big time.
Snitching on you wouldn't
have shortened my sentence.
Anyway, we're friends.
Chen, your mother left the deeds
to the house at the old doctor's.
Crazy Face went there a few times
with Weiwei to kick up a fuss.
Your mother hoped you'd help
take care of Weiwei.
Crazy Face is beyond hope now.
Did Monk ever come and see you?
Yeah, he left you some money.
I've kept it for you.
Your mother asked me
to help you buy the clinic
so that you and the old doctor
could run it together.
Didn't I tell you to give the money
to Zhang Xi?
She'd write to me every month,
telling me about the past.
She never talked about the present.
Has she married?
Chen, slow down!
Where is Zhang Xi now?
I want to see her.
I learned a song especially for her in jail.
She died of an illness last year.
DANGMAI
I'm going out, uncle!
Do you need a motorbike?
What's this?
I just went to pick up some paint.
Is it acting up again?
Hang on.
- It won't take a second.
- Whose bike is this?
Of course.
Wanker!
Who are you swearing at?
Five yuan to Dangmai.
Do you know a group of Miao people
who can play the Lusheng?
What?
Miao people who play the Lusheng pipes.
No one plays the Lusheng anymore.
I know them.
You know them?
The ones that play the Lusheng?
I drive past them every day.
They're just up ahead.
Could you take me there?
Hop on.
Watch he doesn't take you for a ride!
Don't go too fast.
"The hand lit up by fate

"There is bound to be one who will return
"To fill an empty bamboo basket with love
"There is bound to be a crumbling of clay
"As the valley unfolds like an opening fist"
Is this it?
They're all Miao people.
They can play the Lusheng.
- How much?
- Twenty yuan.
Twenty? I thought it was five!
Five? You shouldn't believe that lot.
They would have taken you somewhere
and robbed you clean.
Pricey for such a small place.
Do you know the Miao masters
who play the Lusheng?
(SPEAKING IN MIAO)
Lusheng pipes.
What's up?
I'm looking for a group of Miao
who can play the Lusheng.
Do you know where they are?
They're not here at the moment.
None of these youngsters can play.
Is there a bus to Zhenyuan today?
You're going to Zhenyuan?
That pick-up truck is going there
once it's fixed.
It's not far.
It's on the other side of the river.
I'll have a word with them,
and you can go in the truck.
Thank you!
You're welcome.
Hey, Pisshead!
Can you take this down to the river?
Okay.
Thanks!
It's fully loaded at the front.
But you can squeeze in the back with them.
I hope it's not too much trouble?
No trouble at all. We're going to a gig.
Thank you, thanks very much.
All set?
Let's go, Pisshead!
Thanks again!
What kind of music do you play?
Pop music.
It was supposed to be for our teacher.
But he went to pay respects
to his master who died today.
He can only sing traditional Miao songs.
So, it's a rare chance for us
to play some pop.
Do you know any pop songs?
No. I can only sing children's songs.
Children's songs? We know a few of those.
Listen to this!
One, two, three, four,
five, six,
seven, eight...
Can you pull over? Pull over, please!
...twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,
seventeen, eighteen...
What's all this?
You're making a right fool of yourself.
Why do you let them bully you like this?
Who are you?
Did you draw this watch on your wrist?
Why do they bully you like this?
Did you steal from them?
No.
They wanted to take my binoculars.
Binoculars?
Why do you let them bully you like this?
They've locked my motorbike again.
Locked your motorbike?
Hold on to that.
I'll unlock it for you
if you give me a ride to the station.
The station? Where are you going?
Zhenyuan.
I can only take you as far as the river.
Then you can take a boat.
There's no train station here.
No train station?
I need you to help me find a tailor too.
I need to sew on a few buttons.
They fell off on the ride over here.
Okay.
Try it now.
It should work now.
I'll push it up there first.
Try not to piss them off next time.
I'm just outnumbered, that's all.
All set.
Hop on.
Your engine dies very easily.
Drive slowly.
Move back a little.
Why won't it start?
Hang on. It's just old, is all.
Drive slowly.
Grab something to eat while you're waiting.
What's there to eat around here?
Just grab a quick bite. This is all there is.
Two bowls of rice noodles, please.
No soup for me!
This place looks a lot like Kaili.
Kaili?
Yeah. Have you been there?
No, but Yangyang's going there soon.
Yangyang?
You'll see her in a minute.
What's your name?
Call me Chen.
Chen.
Yangyang is going to be
a tour guide in Kaili.
I know her Kaili guidebook off by heart.
Guidebook?
Kaili lies in the Southeast Asian
tropical monsoon zone.
The average temperature is
16.8 to 18.5 degrees Celsius.
The warmest month is July.
I need two jin of liquor
in a large plastic bottle.
Hang on a second.
Take this one, Pisshead.
I measured it out earlier for someone else.
Go easy on that stuff.
Put it on my tab.
- I'm off!
- Okay.
Yangyang, did you finish
ironing my clothes?
Just a second.
Fetch my clothes first, then you can finish
your lunch. I need to rush home.
Going home today?
Yeah. That's why I need my clothes.
I'll be off then!
Yangyang, can you sew two buttons
for my friend from Kaili here?
I'm from Kaili too.
Wait, I haven't finished with that one yet.
Come in and take off your shirt.
Yangyang, has the water boiled yet?
Not yet.
Let me know when it's ready.
Okay.
You've lost.
That one almost went in.
- Let's play one more round.
- No, we should start rehearsing.
Yangyang, I've come for the hot water.
- Here it is.
- Thanks.
We're about to close.
Are you going to watch the band play?
Yeah. Let's go once I've closed up here.
Okay.
Where are you going?
To the other side of the river.
I'll give you a ride.
No need.
The other side of the river.

How much are the windmills?
Five yuan.
How about three yuan?
I can't sell it for that.
Go on. Three yuan!
I can't sell it for that.
These are for children, not adults.
I like them.
I'll take this one.
It'll only work when it's windy.
A train?
What?
I'm going to watch the band.
I'll make you one later.
When are you going to Kaili?
Soon.
How about I go with you?
I'm going to watch the band play now.
I'm going now.
You go on ahead. I'm almost done.
Go over there so I can rinse your hair.
Round here, we say that only criminals
put their hands behind their back like that.
Why is that?
Old folk say that's what the fugitives
who were exiled here did.
I once had a friend
who met his wife in a disco.
After they got married,
they lived in a tiny room
next to a very loud waterfall.
So, they only danced.
They never talked because
their voices would be drowned out.
One day, his wife got seriously ill.
He was broke.
So, he borrowed money
from a former gang leader.
That gang leader's son
was buried alive by one of his enemies.
Before burying his son alive,
they cut off his hand.
The gang leader accepted his son's death
as normal in his line of work.
But he couldn't come to terms
with his son's hand being cut off.
So, my friend helped the gang leader
get revenge for
what had happened to his son.
He was then sentenced
to nine years in prison.
He got divorced
and left his wife everything.
When he got out of jail,
he discovered his wife had passed away.
Didn't he hear from his wife in prison?
Who knows?
He often got letters from his wife in jail.
- Were the letters written ahead of time?
- In her last letter to him she wrote
that she wanted to see the sea.
I want to see the sea, too.
There was a pond near the prison
that had been dyed blue
by mercury from a mine.
Were there dolphins in that pond?
Dolphins?
It was full of chemicals.
Dolphins wouldn't have survived in there.
Turn the lights off.
- What?
- Turn The lights off.
Give me your hand.
- What?
- Your hand.
You're married?
Yes.
That's what it looks like
when you see dolphins.
The show is about to start.
- Your hair is clean now.
- Okay.
Are you going to watch the band play?
They're playing pop music today.
Okay.
I feel a bit strange.
What?
I'm feeling strange.
Hold this.
I'll sing a song for you.
I'm going to sing "Little Jasmine."
You'll miss the boat if you don't leave now.
Hang on!
I'll wait for you at the top.
Put this on for good luck.
That way the engine won't die on you again.
You like music, don't you?
This tape is for you.
This tape is Li Tailing's Farewell.
Let's go.
Sit tight.
Not again!
The lucky charm Yangyang gave me
hasn't worked.
Stay on the bike.
Chen, I'll take you as far as Dangmai River,
and then I'll be on my way.
I'm going further along
to draw on the trains.
Draw on the trains?
Yangyang says she'll only come back
from Kaili if I can turn back time.
So what are you going to do?
I am going to do exactly that.
The train that transports coal
from Kaili stops at Dangmai.
I'm going to draw a clock on each train.
And the clocks will all be connected.
We often get wild men
following people around here.
So, be careful while you're waiting
for the boat by the river.
I'll tie sticks to your elbows later.
What?
Wooden sticks. I'll tie them to your elbows.
Wild men can tell the difference
between a human being's front and back.
First he'll follow you quietly,
then grab hold of you from behind.
Once he's got hold of you,
the sticks on your elbows
will tickle his armpits.
That'll make him laugh.
That's when you make a run for it.
What's your name?
What?
Weiwei.
Weiwei?
It's like being in a dream.
Take care, Chen!
"Today's sun
"Drags away an entire afternoon
"Like a paralyzed tractor
"White vinegar, wet dreams, wild pomelos,
"Memories pushed
into the veins of my hands
"By a torch sifting light through my palm
"They are like dolphins falling into clouds"

How long do I have to wait?
The kids'll be out of school soon.
Tomorrow they have a handicraft class.
They asked me for buttons
to make handicrafts with.
I don't have any,
so I'm going to buy some
and fix my fan while I'm there.
I'll take him home today.

For all these years,
the only time you ever came to see me
was when you needed
your household registration.
And now you want
to take him away from me?
- I don't have time for this crap.
- It's not crap.
Just look at my life now.
I drop off and pick up
these kids from school
because I'm fond of them.
What's that got to do with me?
I'm suffering from cardiac ischemia.
I owe you however much blood you lost
while you were out on the streets.
I heard Crazy Face was going to sell Weiwei.
So, I immediately brought him here.
I was worried you'd be as sad as I was.
Let Weiwei stay with me for a few more days.
Then you can take him back
when the school term starts in Kaili.
I happened to pick up some buttons
on the way over.
He can use them
for his handicraft class tomorrow.
I'll pick him up on Monday.
"All twists and turns are concealed
in dense flocks of birds
"The sky and seas cannot see them
"But with dreams they become visible
"Moments where all has gone topsy-turvy
"All memories are concealed in similar days
"The spiders of my heart try to emulate
the way humans decorate their homes
"Even nomads with instruments
cannot express
"How close such gazes are to
those of our ancestors,
"How close they are to the starlit sky.
To Guanglian
Thanks!
My father passed away a while back.
- He passed away?
- Yes.
Who are they?
They're my father's pupils.
They're here to play a last song for him.
I also had a tape for him, but I lost it.
"The winter months
are November, December,
"January, February, March, and April.
