What does that mean?
Specialize attention?
He licks my leg.
In situations like this, We
generally recommend medication.
I'm not doing that.

There are many drugs that are
effective, With few side effects.
We all feel this is the best
solution For everybody involved.
Yeah sure.
Come on.
I'm sorry Mom.
- Its okay its not you, but its them.

We burnt down a client's house.

Oh... you see, I thought that I would get
a better rate, once I was certified.
There is not much that I'm good at.
I'm good at getting guys to want me,
Not date me or marry me, but want me.
I am good at that.
And...
And cheering...
I was a really good at cheering.
Cheering is good.
Yes, but it is not so
marketable as you think.
Hey Dad.
Hi. - Do you mind keeping an
eye on Oscar for a while?
Yeah, sure. - I just got to go and
get my couple of shifts back.
Don't go back to be a maid.
That is not a good job for you.
Dad, I need a job.
I hold like about 40.000 dollars on that house
and on top of everything else's, i just...
You're not getting 40000 dollars
by just cleaning houses.
I'll figure something to do.
I will.
Can I make a sandwich?
- Yeah, go ahead you know where everything is.
Go make up with your sister.
She is your sister,
go make up with her.
Dad... please.
What's this?
Just open it.
Why do you have my mom's I.D.?
I found it.
At work.
Me and Rose did a job while back.
And... there was a woman.
Who i...
Look, we're supposed to throw everything away.
But i need you to kept that picture of you...
- Is this her fanny pack?
I couldn't throw them away.
You were following me that day.
I should have told you,
I know that and I..
Felt so stupid and I just
got scared and I. ..
I didn't know what the situation
was between you and your mom.
I do not know what went on.
But I just thought,
That everybody...
That I would understand.
- You would understand?
My Mom was a pathetic drunk.
I'm an idiot, I actually thought
that you were interested in me.
I just wanted to do the right thing.
Please don't.
- Don't call me.
You got that?
- Yeah.
I'm sure that I'll be able to turn this
around pretty quick , so... - Thank you.
For everything.
Are you coming to my party?
We are having Oscar's birthday party...
At Hinkle's, on Saturday.
It would be great if you came.
Sounds like a blast.
I know what you're thinking Oscar, but the
one we saw at the store was full of gymics.
The didn't has what these have.
They didn't have the weight.
There's no history.
Wow, is that an old Zeiss?
This is really a classic
Binocular you got there.
Sorry I'm late,
Look at you.
Hi Dad.
- Hi, dear.
Where are you going?
.....
Okay, I'm sorry.
I know that you think,
I've ruined everything.
And I'm fucked up really
huge, and I'm sorry, okay?
You know what I don't get?
Norah, is that I ask
you to do one thing.
I can't even ask for you to do one
thing without you messing it up.
I mean Jesus, Norah,  It's not like that i
don't have enough to deal with my own life.
But now I have to take care of
you and on top of it i can't.
It is too much, and i can't do it.
- I' am not asking you to.
This business was
everything to me, Norah.
But why you weren't there?
- I was going to be there.
I told you I was gonna be
there, you just couldn't wait,
To burnt the house down?
But you weren't there
And I couldn't...
And I couldn't do it by myself.
I just...
I should have been there, I know.
But...
I just...
I really wanted to go to that baby shower.
It was so stupid.
Those girls looked at me,
like I was just a maid.
You are much better than them, Rose.
What're you going to do now?
I don't know...
They said that i can get my
old job back, if I wanted.
And I can put in
a good word for you.
I don't need for you to
take care of me anymore.
It's not your job
And it never was.
Somebody have to take
care of you, Norah.
You know what I remember
about her funeral?
My shoes.
They were too small
And my feet hurt.
That is what I remember.
You know what I remember?
You wouldn't take off
your shoes after that.
You wore them forever.
It drives me crazy.
I'm still mad at you.
All right.
- Really mad at you.
I heard you build model airplanes?
Do you made money in that?
No, not really.
Hey, what you've got?
Winston gave it to me.
Thank you.
You are welcome.
Have you open up my present?
So the guy said that if you careful, they'll could
last for whole month, So you couldn't shower and shit.
That is good.
Now, these are guaranteed to
make you like a total bad-ass.
What is that say?
Little bastard.
Custom-made.
It's Cool, Norah.
I think I'm taking a road trip.
- Where?
And how?
- In the van.
No, I'm selling the van.
- What?
Why sell the van?
- I can't afford the payment , guys, come on.
Just wait for a while.
It's your birthday.
Happy birthday Oscar.
Pick up, Pick up, Pick up.
- Hello.
Norah turn on the TV, channel 65.
I probably shouldn't
But what you got for dessert?
I recommend the pecan pie.
Are you sure?
One pecan pie coming up.
Hello?
Mom?
Today was Oscar eighth birthday.
And we did a big thing for him
At Hinkle's.
And Winston came.
After dinner Norah and
Oscar played senepede and...
Put A.S.S. as their Initials and
gotten big trouble by the manager.
I don't know
If you are in heaven.
Or not.
But I know that you're not here.
And that is too bad for you.
Because you've really missed out.
You missed out on some really great stuff.
I hope you can hear me.
Hi Dad.
- Hi.
I got to talk to you.
I have to move in with you
and Oscar for a while.
Why? - Just temporarily, just
until I got my own place.
You lost the house?
Dad, how could you lose the house?
I didn't lose the house.
I sold the house.
I have a very good business
opportunity and I took it.
I hope its not shrimp.
- No, nothing fly by night.
I have a partner, a really good
partner, Who knows the ropes?
And I'm going to be working under them.
Dad?
Since 1963? - Yes, it shows that we
got some stability, people like that.
That is a lie.
Its a business lie.
And that is different from a life lie.
Okay.
I can live with that.
- You'll be the boss.
That is great.
You'll get use to it.
