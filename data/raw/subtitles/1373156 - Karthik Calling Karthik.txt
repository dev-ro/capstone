- Hello...
- Good morning, sir.
- Sir, USC Bank is offering you
a free credit card.
- I’m not interested, thank you.
- Sir, hello...
hello, sir... hello...
- Karthik!
Karthik... wait!
- Mr Karthik...
Where do you think you're going?
I’m deducting ten thousand rupees...
from your lease deposit
as elevator repair charges.
- From my deposit...
- Why not?
Don't you use the elevator?
Of course, you do!
l need more deposit.
Fifty thousand rupees!
- Or you can vacate the apartment.
- But...
I’ve let one of the garages...
number four on rent.
The rent is fifteen thousand rupees.
And the deposit is
one hundred thousand!
it’s okay if you can't afford it.
it’s alright, there are
many waiting for that flat.
So... Mr Karthik...
What's your mobile number?
l don't use a mobile.
l knew that!
Then why did you ask?
No reason!
About time you became cool.
Cool?
I’m not a fool!
l read on the internet that...
the radiation of the mobile battery
causes brain damage.
What??
Don't you know about
the egg and mobile experiment?
Egg and mobile?
No!
A mobile was kept ringing
near an egg for weeks.
After three weeks
chicks emerged from the other eggs.
But from the egg near the mobile...
only water!
I’m not bothered...
l don't own a poultry farm!
Boss said you'd do it.
But I’m doing this...
If you have a problem,
have a word with the boss.
Talk to him.
What do you actually do all day?
Sir...
You haven't cracked a single deal!
We're a construction company and
you haven't sold a single piece of land.
Sir, last year l bagged four deals.
You didn't bag those deals,
Vinay did!
No, sir...
Sir, those leads... meetings...
- Stop making excuses!
This is exactly what
I’m talking about, you idiot!
I’m sorry, sir.
I’ll try harder.
You know what, Karthik,
this is your final warning.
- You must bag
at least two deals this month.
Otherwise I’m sorry, but l...
don't think l will
want you in this company.
Sir, but l handle the paper work
of the entire office, sir...
- So what?
You don't want to move
a single muscle?
- You want to be paid
to sit on your behind?
No, sir.
Get out.
- Good morning, Shonali.
- Good morning.
Everyday l see your face...
and l know that even in hell
one can find an angel.
My angel.
Excuse me, what's the time?
- Karthik, you have to prepare
all the Raheja contracts tonight.
- We need to submit them
tomorrow morning.
But... but sir, there are 11 contracts.
- l know that,
but you have the whole night.
Just do it.
Hello...
- Karthik, where the hell are
the DLH Builders' contracts?
l don't know, sir.
- What do you mean,
you don't know??
- You had to prepare both
the Raheja and DLH Builders' contracts.
- Only the Raheja contracts
are present here.
No, sir,
you mentioned only Raheja.
- Don't lie to me, Karthik!
- l dearly told you,
Raheja and DLH Builders, both.
No, sir... really...
- l don't care how you do it, Karthik.
- l want those contracts ready
by one p.m. today!!
But sir, l just got home...
l haven't slept at all.
- l don't pay you to sleep.
- Come to office right now and do it!
- Don't even know why I’ve hired you.
- Idiot!
Karthik!
Yes, sir.
Hurry up!
Come to my car.
Yes, Mr Ratan...
Yes...
Of course!
The Thane land is yours!
Trust me, it isn't illegal!
We don't indulge in such deals.
Sir, the court has passed
a stay order on that land.
Okay... bye.
Keep your trap shut!!
Anyway, you know what
these contracts seem fine.
Driver, stop the car.
You can get off over here.
- This is a good piece.
- It's Japanese, a new model.
it has many amazing features.
Alarm, calendar...
Sir?
Card or cash?
Birthday present in advance.
idiot!
- Mom and dad never believed
that he troubled me.
- He never did anything
in their presence.
- l had to suffer Kumar's taunts...
- his anger, everyday.
- That day he took me
some place.
- We got there and
he tried to push me into a well.
- l managed to free myself
and ran away, but...
- but Kumar fell into the well.
- Because of me.
- I’m responsible for his death.
- l took his life.
It wasn't your fault.
Did you push him intentionally?
No.
That incident has scared you...
from confronting people all your life.
You still believe that...
you're better off
tolerating everything silently.
But people take advantage of this.
Then what should l do?
Don't let anyone suppress you.
Build your self confidence.
Stand up for yourself.
May l come in, sir?
Sir, l was upset.
About what?
That you thought,
l didn't prepare the DLH contracts, sir.
Sir...
In fact you forgot to
tell me about them.
You mean to say it was my fault.
No, sir... that's not what l meant.
Sir, l... just wanted you to know that.
- That I’m an idiot!
- No, sir...
I’m an ass!
In fact...
you want me to
say sorry to you.
- Come... please...
- Listen up everyone.
Look here.
Our friend, Mr Karthik Narayan,
wants me to say sorry to him.
- Sir... l...
- Just because l gave you
some work to do...
you think I’m being unreasonable.
He forgets to do it...
You're fired!
Do you understand that?
Who is this guy?
- Someone new?
- No.
- He's been here for four years.
- Karthik.
Strange... never noticed him.
- Mr Karthik...
How nice!
You want to use the lift...
but don't want to
pay for the maintenance!
Such a loser!
Hello...
- Mr Karthik...
Oh... Mr Karthik...
- are you inside?
- Mr Karthik...
- Oh... Mr Karthik...
Great!
What a way to celebrate a birthday!
Couldn't do anything great in this life.
Guess I’ll try again!
Hello...
Happy birthday to you...
happy birthday to you...
Happy Birthday, Karthik.
- Who is this?
- Don’t you recognise the voice?
This is Karthik.
I am Karthik.
And so are you.
What's the meaning of this?
What were you trying to do?
Take your own life?
Since you were out of insecticide...
you thought you would
overdose on sleeping pills.
But now...
you needn’t die.
Now that I'm here.
Everything is going to change, Karthik...
everything!
I'm going to improve your life.
Who is this?
If I'm not Karthik,
how do I know that...
your bank PIN number...
is 1-2-7-6?
Or that the scar below your eye...
was the result of...
being hit by a cricket ball
when you were eight.
When you're nervous...
you start scratching yourself.
Am I right?
Alright then, tell me...
What do you want to know?
The colour of your socks?
Yesterday you wore black socks.
and you're still wearing them.
and if you don’t change them...
your big toe
will tear it's way out...
to say, ''Hello!''
Nobody called you last night.
What?
Nobody called you...
last night.
Well then check today's call history.
Five at night...
would be today.
No calls today either.
The last call you received was...
four days ago.
That's it!
Could have been last week.
Perhaps you forgot.
- Sir...
please.
Your phone isn't ringing...
it's your...
ears that are ringing!
- Your ears!
Hello...
I knew it!
I knew you wouldn’t believe and...
go to the telephone exchange.
What did you find out?
That nobody called you?
Did you think that
last night was a dream?
Don’t you believe or...
don’t you want things to change?
Probably you choose
to live a miserable life.
Or you prefer living in dreams?
But you aren’t peaceful
even in your dreams.
You still dream about
your brother Kumar.
How do you know that?
And every week,
you waste a lot of money...
taking advice from a psychiatrist!
Has the therapy
over the years helped you?
Of course not?
Don’t you wish Shonali
were a part of your life?
Or are you content writing emails
and not sending them?
Is this how you wish to live?
Or don’t you believe that
someone is really trying to help?
Believe it or not.
I call you.
Do l threaten you?
Do I trouble you?
Am I hurting you?
No?
Then why can’t you believe
that I am your well wisher, Karthik?
Just wait for me to call.
And in time, you and I
will make everything alright.
All you need to do is trust me.
Believe what I say...
do what I say...
and everything will be good again.
Trust me.
Believe that things will change.
Don't you want to change your life?
Do you believe in me, Karthík?
Do you believe in me?
Do you?
Trust me, Karthík...
trust me!
Believe in me!
Don't you wish to improve your life?
Don't you want your life to change?
Trust me, Karthik.
l want my life to change.
Trust me, Karthik.
Believe me!
Trust me, Karthik.
Trust me!
And everything will be fine.
l believe you.
Your biggest drawback is...
that you're unable to
say 'no' to people.
You just can’t say 'no'.
It's okay to say 'no'.
If you don’t,
people will take you for a ride.
Learn to say 'no'.
No?
Say it loudly...
with confidence.
- Karthik... Karthik... Karthik...
- Where's my deposit?
- You're paying, aren't you?
- Tell me, yes or no?
No!
- What?
You have to give me five thousand.
Why is that?
Thirty thousand to
repair the kitchen leakage.
Twenty five thousand to
repair the living room flooring.
I’ve spent a total of
fifty five thousand.
That's five thousand more
than the deposit.
So give it to me.
You seem upset...
and that too without any reason.
You don't need to be upset about it.
hold on...
And shut down the illegal office...
in garage number four.
What's it to you?
l don't like the cap
of the watchman out there.
Cap?
Shut it down or I’ll have it raided.
My aunt works at
the Property Tax Department.
I’ll call her over for lunch.
- She'll sniff it out.
- Okay.
No! No...
My phone... it's ringing...
for a while now...
Here's your five thousand.
Take it...
please... l insist.
l was only kidding.
Let me help you...
You aren’t responsible
for your brother's death.
The fact is...
when you began to run away...
he tried to tie you with a rope.
He lost his balance and
he fell into the well.
You've been carrying
this guilt all your life...
even though you've done no wrong.
So l didn't kill him?
He was a bully.
He died due to his own fault.
Prepare yourself, Karthik...
to sort out the other bullies.
Who stood first in college?
So who deserves the respect?
Be the man,
you've always wanted to be.
Be me!
Barge into Kamath's cabin and...
look at him and say...
Kamath!
- We need to talk.
What the hell
is the meaning of this?
Listen, if you're here
for your old job...
I’m worried.
Wondering if Mr Ratan finds out that...
the land you're selling him
is illegal.
You will be in a huge mess.
Anyway...
this week you have...
a meeting with Ambuja, don't you?
- Yes.
Are the contracts ready?
Yes.
May I?
What are you afraid of, Kamath?
Let me have a look.
Great!
If Ambuja  signs this contract...
you won't make
a profit of hundred million.
You will incur a loss of forty million.
What??
You mean there is a mistake?
There are twelve.
Sorry.
Aren't you getting late for the meeting?
What are the mistakes?
Why will I incur a loss?
The Rain Clause is absent.
If work is delayed due to the rain...
your company will have to
bear all the losses.
Service Tax has been
charged at 12.24%.
Last year the Service Tax
was increased to 12.36%.
Which means...
according to this costing,
your company...
will incur a loss of
four million eight hundred thousand.
I’m working with a bunch of idiots!
The fact is,
you never realised...
why the paper work
in the office is perfect.
It was me, Kamath.
Me!
How about a game?
Good afternoon.
If anyone can tell the boss...
the 1984 amendment of
the Builders Act, 15 A...
then he will give that person...
his very own Mercedes.
What's wrong?
None of them have a due.
Greta, does anyone know
the 1984 amendment of the Act?
- Sir, they're checking on the internet, sir.
Idiots!
By the way...
do you know what it is?
- It's basically... umm...
The amendment says that
the builder has to...
renew his licence every four years.
If the licence is not renewed...
then all his deals
will be considered illegal.
- He could also be imprisoned.
When did your father
start this company for you?
01/09/05
And...
today is?
31st August...
2009!
So you have just one day
to renew the licence.
Oh my God!
This could even take a week.
I’ll take your leave.
Okay.
- No, Karthik, l need you.
You can...
have your...
your old position back.
Job?
You mean that crummy job?
Okay, what is it that you want?
Head of Business Development.
A four fold increase in my salary.
Two assistants.
And the new corner cabin.
The cabin?
- no?
Let's play another game...
No... it's okay... okay.
Done.
Just tell me the procedure
to renew the licence.
I’m here now!
Relax...
chill.
Both mobiles belong to you?
Yes.
And you use them repeatedly?
Yes.
Very good!
Feels good doesn’t it, Karthik?
Don’t you like it?
It's unbelievable
that till a few days ago...
you had no respect.
You were a slave.
And now...
Now everyone knows who you are.
- Yes...
- Shonali needs to notice you now.
Don’t you want her
in your life, Karthik?
Get ready...
we have a new mission.
What about Ashish?
First of all,
go and talk to her boyfriend.
It's time he went back to his wife.
Wife?
- Hi, Ashish...
- Hi, Karthik...
Everything alright?
Wife?
Kids?
Congrats on the promotion,
by the way.
Whatever, pal!
So tell me...
when are you telling Shonali
about your wife?
Um... wi... wife?
Yes.
Wi... wife.
The one in Delhi.
And your six year old kid.
Ring a bell?
How did you find out?
It was on the entertainment channel.
Saw it on the scroll.
Does it even matter?
The question is
who will tell Shonali?
You?
Or l?
l was to leave my wife...
l mean, I’m going to leave her.
Then tell Shonali that!
Karthik, what's it to you?
I like the sound of a slap.
Sound?
How could you?
You lied to me?
If l hadn't...
you wouldn't go out with me.
What??
Are you stupid?
That's your excuse?
Shonali, just listen to me...
That's for lying!
That's for having a stupid excuse.
That was on behalf of your wife.
Someone asked me...
why men chase women...
they don't intend to marry?
l replied...
if dogs chase cars...
doesn't mean they want to drive!
l always knew that men are like dogs.
That's very unfair.
Dogs are loyal.
Do you need a lift?
Can l drop you somewhere?
Can you drop
this conversation instead?
Granted that you
think men are like dogs.
Then as a dog would...
may l follow you?
No, I’m fine.
I’ve been alone.
it’s... it's very overrated.
And no fun at all.
Let's do this...
you can vent your anger on me.
There are two benefits to this.
The first...
you'll feel better and...
secondly...
we'll get to know each other.
Karthik, that's really sweet of you...
but right now it's better...
that l stay away from you men
as much as possible.
Don't get me wrong,
but I’m not interested.
- But... If...
- Karthik!
l don't want to hear a thing.
You remember the story of
King Bruce and the spider?
The spider never lost hope despite
Repeatedly falling off a wall.
But...
Didn’t Shonali say that...
she doesn’t want to hear a thing?
Don’t worry.
You said you don't want to
Hear a thing.
Yeah...
But...
chat involves reading, right?
Well then, no chatting also!
Hey ya...
Hey ya...
Hey ya...
l see you walking through the door...
Hey ya...
Why won’t you look across the floor...
Hey ya...
I got to tell you how I feel...
Hey ya...
Oh baby... you're the only one for me...
Hey ya...
Hey ya...
Hey ya...
Hey ya...
Hey ya...
I wanna get closer to you...
Hey ya...
I need to be closer to you...
Hey ya...
I got to tell you how I feel...
Hey ya...
Oh baby... you're the only one for me...
What can I say about how I feel...
Now that you're with me...
I have all I need, life is brighter...
Now that you're with me...
Where are we going?
To have coffee.
Of course, but where?
Khandala.
The hill station??
Yes.
You agreed to have coffee...
you didn't specify the place.
- Didn't we come here for...
coffee!
Just wait...
Coffee.
Coffee!
All of this is specially for today?
This?
No, I’ve had it in my pocket
For three years now!
Just joking!
All of this is especially for you.
One time offer only!
l know everybody says...
that l should
practice as an independent architect.
But even out here, l get to
design a couple of buildings, don't l?
l agree the people at work are boring...
and we have a grumpy boss.
But other aspects of a job
are also important.
For example, security...
stability...
just like in relationships.
True!
But these days,
nice guys are hard to come by.
Someone who is
sweet, simple, honest...
By the way...
have you come across such a guy?
No...
l haven't come across a guy like that.
I’m straight!
Yeah...
You know...
you know what l mean!
l mean like a gentleman.
By the way...
I’m no animal.
I’m quite gentle.
Yeah, Of course,
you aren't an animal!
You aren't loud or lazy.
You mean to say I’m boring?
No, no, no... no...
l mean...
you're a nice guy,
you're a...
safe guy.
Safe?
Yes!
And that's a good thing.
You're concerned...
polite...
you aren't cheap nor vulgar.
l mean, l can't even imagine...
that you'd misbehave with a girl.
Can't even imagine!
Safe!
If you'd like...
l could teach you to misbehave.
Really!
I hope you're happy, Karthik.
Very soon...
Shonalí will be yours.
Forever!
Hey ya...
I wanna get closer to you...
Hey ya...
I need to be closer to you...
Hey ya...
I got to tell you how I feel...
Hey ya...
Oh baby... you're the only one for me...
What can I say about how I feel...
Now that you're with me...
I have all I need, life is brighter...
Now that you're with me...
Hey ya...
Hey ya...
A new colour adorns...
Every path as we stride...
Your eyes twinkle and smile...
As you call me with arms open wide...
As my dreams slowly bloom...
My heart sings a new tune...
I have all I need, life is brighter...
Now that you're with me...
Hey ya...
Hey ya...
Your radiance doesn’t fade away...
I don’t ever need to be blue...
The more I know you each day...
I see a bright new side of you...
Life still feels so unreal...
Yet I like the way I feel...
I have all I need, life is brighter...
Now that you're with me...
Hey ya...
I wanna get closer to you...
Hey ya...
I need to be closer to you...
Hey ya...
I got to tell you how I feel...
Hey ya...
Oh baby... you're the only one for me...
Oh baby...
Hey ya...
Oh baby...
Hey ya...
The only one for me...
Hey ya...
Cheeku??
- Neelu!
- Cheeku! Oh my God!
How many years has it been?
You're all grown up now.
Well, l had no other option, did l?
I’m Neelu,
his cousin from Hyderabad.
- And you are?
- Shonali...
Did you elope and get married?
No... no...
Just friends?
You can't charm her, can you?
No...
No... umm... yes...
l mean, what are you saying?!
l knew it!
You can't do it!
Especially not her!
She's so gorgeous!
You consider him
like your brother, don't you?
His girlfriend...
I’m his girlfriend!
But you're the complete package!
Jackpot, Cheeku!
We've moved here.
Sid has started a new business.
- Siddharth is in Mumbai ?
- Yes.
By the way,
Siddharth is her husband and...
my college friend.
So tell me...
have you told aunt?
Mom?
About what?
About her!
Well...
So when are you eloping to marry?
Siddharth...
I’ll be back...
- Hi...
- How're you doing?
- Doing great.
- How are you?
Let me guess...
you eloped and married, didn't you?
How do you know?
Just!
Don't you think...
he should've
at least told his mother...
that he has a hot girlfriend!
- Why hide it now
since he is her only son?
We were always
concerned about him.
Because he was shy,
very reserved, always alone...
But now we can relax,
because you're there.
Thanks for putting up with Neelu.
Actually, l enjoyed it, Cheeku!
And thanks for saying that
you're my girlfriend.
l mean, sorry...
that you had to lie about it.
Oh...
you're so sure l was lying?
Cheeku!
You mean...
it was the truth?
Maybe yes...
maybe no.
Cheeku!
Thanks a lot.
Really... thanks.
I know everything is perfect!
But Karthik, I want you
to promise me one thing.
Never tell anyone...
that I call you.
If you do,
people will think you're crazy and...
and I don’t want that!
Just promise me,
you will never tell anyone.
l promise.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for calling.
Well then, thanks for taking my calls.
You don't need to thank me.
I’m not charged for in coming calls.
Come on, let's dance.
l don't dance.
Why?
I’ve never danced.
Not even if a...
gorgeous girl requests?
Well... that's if a gorgeous girl...
actually requests.
You are so mean.
- Okay, get me a drink.
- Sure.
Pepsi, orange juice, apple juice...
Juice??
Juice!
Juice is fine but dilute it...
with vodka!
Oh God! Let me guess.
You don't drink!
If l do get drunk...
will you take advantage of me?
No...
Then what's the point!?
The Dervish dances...
Mesmerised by the music...
The Dervish dances...
Mesmerised by the music...
Sway to the beat, let's dance...
Hum the tune, come on dance...
flow with the rhythm, slide in it's trance...
Drink in the harmony, let loose and dance...
Your grace, I like the way you move...
Your style, I like to see you groove...
Your gaze, it says I wanna dance with you...
Your grace, I like the way you move...
Your style, I like to see you groove...
Your gaze, it says I wanna dance with you...
A gorgeous vision, so unreal you are...
An illusion, so near yet so very far...
All around, your radiance and shine...
You are one of a kind, ethereal and divine...
Let's fulfil our dream and dance...
feel my heartbeat, move closer and dance...
Cherish my love as we dance...
Drown yourself in me, let's dance...
Your grace, I like the way you move...
Your style, I like to see you groove...
Your gaze, it says I wanna dance with you...
Your grace, I like the way you move...
Your style, I like to see you groove...
Your gaze, it says I wanna dance with you...
What's that?
Holy water!
Whisky?
But weren't you
having wine at the pub?
Wine?
Wine is for girls, darling.
Is that so...
I’ll take that.
No, that's enough,
you've had too much.
- Please.
- No.
- Just give.
- No... no.
Listen... no.
Why?
You want some too?
you've had a lot already.
Fine!
Good night.
Kiss me!
What?
Kiss me.
No...
not now.
Why not?
Scared are you?
l know you like me!
l do...
but in this state...
you better sleep.
Don't misunderstand me.
l want to.
And you know l really like you.
I’ll keep thinking...
I’m taking advantage,
since you're drunk.
Advantage?
You are very high.
And you should sleep.
Fine!
Good night.
- Safe boy!!
Now what?
Now even I’m drunk.
Now it's okay...
we can take advantage
of each other.
What happened?
Capturing this moment.
Why?
So I’ll remember it forever.
What do you mean remember it?
You aren't going away, are you?
Why do you say that?
You're not just
having fun with me, are you?
l mean, this isn't just like
a one night thing, right?
What?
Is that what you think?
You think this is
just physical for me?
I’ve met a lot of men who...
appear to be nice
in the beginning...
and then just disappear.
Or they're bloody married!
Come with me.
- But where?
- Come on.
13th October 2007.
- Today, for Diwali...
- For Diwali...
you distributed sweets to everyone.
You shook hands with everyone.
This is my happiest Diwali...
because today you saw me...
and l got to touch your hand.
You haven't come to office for four days.
21st August 2008.
Just heard that you've
gone to Goa for a week.
You will be back after three days.
Each day without you
is like a lifetime.
Why didn't you send these?
How we met each other...
and now we keep getting closer...
Every moment now, is new to know...
Why does it seem...
The heart is humming a melody...
Why does it seem...
Every moment is smiling with glee...
When I saw you...
for the very first time...
All I wished was...
for you to be mine...
Once it was a dream...
just you and I...
and you softly whisper...
I am yours, now and forever more...
Why does it seem...
The heart is humming a melody...
Why does it seem...
Every moment is smiling with glee...
Every moment now, is new to know...
Karthik...
Karthik sir!
Karthik sir...
- Listen, l...
- Hold it!
Shut the door.
As l was saying...
Shut it from outside.
Jackass!
Karthik...
how many girlfriends have you had?
So how many girlfriends?
Girlfriends?
Including you?
One.
And that's
never going to change either.
Karthik, you know I’ve had boyfriends...
but I’ve always burnt my fingers.
I’ve been through it so many times...
that I’m always scared.
What are you scared about?
You know Ashish?
He was married!
Really??
The bastard had
a wife and a child in Delhi.
He lied to me.
Promise me, Karthik...
that you'll never keep secrets
from me.
If you ever lie to me...
it will hurt too much.
l love you a lot.
And l don't want to lose you.
Trust me, Shona.
I’m not like those other guys.
I’m just a guy who loves you.
A lot!
I’ll never keep any secrets.
No matter what...
just tell me the truth.
Promise me.
Never tell anyone...
that I call you.
Actually... you see...
there's something...
that is unusual.
Well, not unusual...
it's special.
What is it?
You see...
the thing is...
It's our little secret, Karthik.
What?
Shona, l...
The phone, Karthik...
Yeah... just ignore it.
- I’ll answer it.
- No!
l... I’ll get it.
Hello...
Hello...
- Good evening, sir.
I’m calling from USC bank, sir.
- Sir, our bank has introduced
a new credit card offer.
- If you apply for one card,
you will also get a complimentary card.
Who was it?
Nobody.
It was a wrong number.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You were saying something.
Something 'unusual'?
Umm... well l...
was saying that...
For a girl like you...
to be with a...
boy like me...
it's...
it's very unusual.
Shona, everyday l get this call.
It helps me.
What do you mean?
l talk to him for hours.
With whom?
Talk to whom?
Who calls you, Karthik?
Karthik.
l call myself.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, l?
The person who calls is Karthik.
l mean...
it is l.
Stop joking, silly!
- Are you serious??
Karthik, are you serious??
l really do get these calls.
But I’m not troubled by them.
They've helped me.
They've transformed my life.
Do you know what you're saying??
How is it possible?
l don't know but it does happen.
Karthik, someone is playing
a prank on you.
How can helping me benefit others?
Correct!
Even l get calls from myself.
- You too?!
- No! Because it's not possible.
It is possible!
And in my life
it happens to be normal.
Shona...
l think you need help.
Please, let's go to a doctor.
Shona, you're overreacting.
There is no problem.
Don't you worry.
After we're married,
I’ll keep the phone here...
in the living room
and talk softly.
It won't even disturb your sleep.
You really think, with your condition,
we should marry?
Shona, don't do this.
We're being honest.
And now you're saying,
you don't love me!
Of course, l love you
that's why I’m saying this.
For your well being,
our well being.
I’m sorry, Shona, l...
won't see a psychiatrist.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
No, Shona...
Karthik, then you decide.
Either you see a psychiatrist or else...
l really don't have the energy for
one more bad relationship.
Alright, I’ll go.
I told you not to?
And yet you told her.
How did it help?
Now Shonali thinks you're nuts,
doesn't she?
Now listen...
nothing is lost yet.
Don’t listen to her.
Don’t go to the psychiatrist.
What are you afraid of?
That Shonali will leave you?
If she truly loves you...
she will understand.
Who changed your life?
I did.
Who got your job back?
I did!
Who helped you win Shonali?
I did!
And now you won’t listen to me?
You've seen the
consequences of telling the truth.
Now see what a lie can do.
Go to Shonali and tell her...
I won't go to the psychiatrist.
What?
Umm... l don't get any calls.
Karthik, are you lying to me?
Look me in the eyes.
You are lying to me!
You're lying, aren't you?
No, Shonali... l really...
don't get any calls.
l was kidding.
You're lying to me, aren't you?
Yes.
Why don't you understand that
l can't go to the psychiatrist?
Why not?
Because he said so!
l trust his judgement.
Following his advice
has always benefited me.
Well, this time it won't!
l can't spend the rest of my life
with an unstable man.
And anyway you prefer
to spend your life with a phone...
Wait!
Fine!
I’ll go.
These calls are
your imagination, Karthik.
- Don't you believe me?
- It's not that l don't.
l believe that you think
you get these calls but...
Karthik, l need to tell you something.
l think, l know what this is.
it’s an uncommon
psychological disorder.
It could be schizophrenia,
causing the hallucinations.
In this condition,
a man talks to people...
who are only visible to him.
He thinks that these people are
telling him something...
through these calls, in your case.
But this is
just a figment of imagination.
These... these aren't hallucinations.
it’s in your mind.
These calls don't really come, Karthik.
Okay, tell me.
Have you received these calls
when others are present?
No.
Ever wonder why you get these calls,
only when you're alone?
Okay...
have you tried finding out
from where you get these calls?
l did go,
to the telephone exchange.
- Okay and...
They said, l don't get any calls.
See?
I’m not imagining this!
Karthik, please let me help you.
You have to try some medication,
you'll see the difference.
Medicines to cure what?
I’m... l am fine!
When do you get this call?
At five in the morning.
l don't do this usually, but I’m
going to make an exception for you.
Can l come over to your place?
l want to see for myself that
you get the call.
Sure!
Then you will know for sure,
that this isn't my imagination.
And please tell Shonali
that I’m not crazy!
Hello, good morning.
Is she here?
So...
she turned pale
when the phone rang?
Switch on the speakerphone.
Go on, talk to him.
- Hello...
- Hello, Dr Kapadia.
So tell me,
you've known me all these years.
You should know by now,
that I never lie.
If I said I exist, that means I do.
it’s one of your friends, right?
How do I convince you,
I really am Karthik?
I too am Karthik.
What can I say to convince you?
That you kept me
waiting for an hour today?
That you took notes ten times
during the session?
You checked your watch twice...
and you didn’t have
change for thousand rupees?
Why can’t you believe
that I exist, damn it!!
That my calls help?
That I've achieved somethíng...
you and your therapy
couldn’t for years??
On the contrary, you're telling him
that I don’t exist.
That I am not real.
Karthik is like a child, Qr Kapadia.
He needs me.
You have children too, don’t you?
How would you feel,
if someone told them...
that you don’t exist?
That you aren’t real?
Or if someone were to tell you
that your kids...
Your kids are
in school, aren't they?
You think they are safe there?
What??
She ran away?
You're telling me that
your psychiatrist is also mad?
Why can't you just accept
that this call is a part of my life?
Because, it's not possible, Karthik.
But, Dr Kapadia spoke with him.
Okay!
This isn't your imagination!
That means someone is
making a fool out of you.
No.
l know what to do.
Don't be scared,
I’m there with you.
Shona, do l look scared?
Whoever it is,
we'll have him arrested.
Stop being absurd!
Oh really! I’m being absurd?
He said nobody would believe.
Who said that?
He did!
Don't answer it!
- What??
- Just leave it unanswered.
Have you ever ignored it?
You haven't, right?
Let's see what happens.
- But Shona...
- No, Karthik!
Let it ring!
Let's see what happens.
He will call for
a couple of days and stop.
Shonali, he'll feel bad.
And if you answer, then l will.
Just let it ring!
- l have to answer it...
- Don't answer, Karthik.
Don't worry.
it’s not like someone is
going to step out and kill you.
I’m sorry.
Actually, sir...
these bills have been
pending for three months.
-The lights were on,
so thought you might be awake.
l need to leave, Karthik.
Are you okay?
Did you answer the phone?
Sweetheart...
Don't answer the calls
and everything will be alright.
Everything will be ruined!
No, it won't!
Why don't you understand that
I’m nothing without the calls?
That's not true, Karthik.
You are an intelligent and fun guy.
No, I’m not!
Did you even notice me before?
Did it ever matter to you
if l were alive or not?
It mattered to him.
He became my friend,
my guardian, my guide...
he fixed everything!
You are a part of my life
because of him.
And now you have
a problem with him?
See!
Now you don't want to be with me.
He said you wouldn't understand.
What do you want me to understand??
Do you know who he is,
where he lives...
his whereabouts...
How does it matter?
He has helped me a lot.
And l will talk to him.
Shona...
l need to speak to him.
How can l
keep you happy without his help?
Please...
You need help, Karthik.
He is the help, Shona.
l will talk to him...
Are you with me?
You were right.
No one will understand.
l shouldn't have told anyone.
Hello... Karthik...
I’m sorry, l didn't...
You made a big mistake, Karthik.
Very big!
Didn’t l warn you?
Not to tell anyone.
Yet you did!
I told you
not to see the psychiatrist...
but you actually brought her home!
and then...
yesterday you crossed the limits!
You didn’t answer my call.
My call!?
How dare you?
Now you'll have to pay for it?
Do you think that
if I can take you to the top...
l can't bring you down??
Just watch as
I ruin your life in a flash!
Please... listen to me...
- You...
- You are finished!
Now...
I’m going to bring you down!
You took Shonali's advice, didn’t you?
Just wait.
You are finished, Karthik.
finished!
Karthik, please listen to me.
You never let me speak... please...
Hello...
hello...
hello...
Sir, hurry up,
Mr Kamath is waiting for you.
Yes, sir?
Who the hell
do you think you are?
You think you can blackmail me,
you son of a bitch?
Sir, what happened?
You think, if you
call me at night and...
threaten me, I’ll get scared?
No, sir... l didn't call you.
Don't lie to me!!
l know it is you who called.
You threatened to
tell my wife about my affairs!
You bastard!
No, sir.
l really didn't call.
Only you knew about it.
You think
l don't recognise your voice?
It was you!
- Listen Karthik,
you maybe very good...
with your work, all your accounts and
figures, but now you've gotten personal!!
Sir...
it wasn't me, sir...
It wasn't you?
Listen to me very carefully!
If you ever call my home again...
I’ll bury you in cement
in the basement of this very office.
I’ll bury you,
do you understand me?
You're finished!
home loan, pension plan,
everything is finished!!
You will never work
in this industry again!
- Now you get out of my office...
- Sir, really...
Get out!
Get out of my office!!
Yes, Mr Ratan...
- Karthik!
You called Mr Ratan
and told him...
that the Thane land is illegal.
No, sir... l didn't call him.
Because of you,
l have lost eight hundred million!
Can you understand me?
Eight hundred million!!
They're suing us,
you son of a bitch!
We're ruined!
I’m going to kill you right here.
- Sir...
- Right here, I’m going to kill you.
- Sir...
- Sir... sir, stop it...
Leave me!!
Security, remove him from the premises!
How could you, Karthik?
How could you say all those things?
What did l say?
As if you don't know!
Karthik, you called me
a slut and a prostitute!
You said I’ve been with
everyone in the office...
When did l say that?
Who told you l said that?
Who??
You did, Karthik,
last night on the phone.
You made fun of me.
You accused me!
You mocked all the private feelings
l shared with you, only you.
l didn't call you, Shona.
Believe me that was him!
You think I’m stupid??
It was you, Karthik.
And you know what...
l never want to
see your face again!
l can't believe
l thought you were special!
Now you'll pay for your actions?
You are finished, Karthik.
finished!
Sir, the card was declined.
What?
it’s a debit card,
not a credit card.
How can it be declined?
Whatever!
The payment didn't go through.
Sir, your account has zero balance.
You have no money!
But all my savings were in that account.
Yesterday there was
a balance of about one and half million.
Sir, last night,
using the telebanking service...
you transferred all your funds.
How is that possible?
- Sir, through telebanking.
- You verify your password,
your PIN number, your...
l know what telebanking is!
Where has my money
been transferred to?
Sir, you transferred it to... umm...
a Foundation for Children Fund.
l do donate five thousand
to that account, every month...
but l didn't transfer everything.
Sir, you transferred everything yesterday.
Now I’m going to
take it all back, Karthik!
Now...
I’m going to bring you down!
I’m going to bring you down!
You are finished, Karthik.
finished!
Excuse me...
can you do me a favour, please?
Will you buy a ticket for me?
- To where?
-Any city...
but don't tell me which city.
Here is the money.
Just tell me
the platform number, please.
You need to get off here.
Can you help me alight?
Excuse me... please give him a hand...
- Here's the rickshaw.
- Thank you...
- It's alright.
Take me to a small hotel...
- Which one?
- Any hotel will do.
Welcome, sir.
Okay, sir...
Thank you.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
How much for two weeks?
Single room,
daily six hundred fifty rupees.
Eight thousand rupees for two weeks.
Discount price, sir.
Here's ten thousand.
Do me a favour.
Disconnect the phone
in my room and remove it.
Also remove all the stationery.
The TV too and
also the room number sign.
Don't deliver the newspaper, please.
Don't disturb me at all.
Deliver the meals to the room.
Now even l don't know where l am...
so how will he?
Here...
l hope you like the food...
Of course, l do.
- I’ll leave now.
- Bye.
What brought about this sadness...
Oh heart of mine...
and with it such painful loneliness...
Oh heart of mine...
Every step the silence of the memories _ream...
The eyes ache with sorrow, but shed no tear...
Oh answer... why is it so?
Why forsakes me, the bright glow?
What brought about this sadness...
Oh heart of mine...
People... they come and go...
You know... it's always been so...
Everyone left, they're here no more...
How does it help to cry yourself sore?
They remember you no more...
Letting go is the only cure...
Or with me...
This agony, you too can endure...
Trust me...
Oh heart of mine...
forget the past...
It's never meant to last?
What brought about this sadness...
Goodbyes hurt most
when you don't get to say them.
It wasn't my fault, Shonali.
- Hello...
- Hi, this is Dr Kapadia here.
- Hello...
- Hi, this is Dr Kapadia here.
Sorry to disturb you in the office but...
but l need to meet Karthik.
Do you know where he is?
- No... umm...
- actually, I’ve been
trying to contact him but...
- l have no idea where he is.
Okay.
Okay, can you please call me
if you hear from him?
- Yes, Of course.
Thanks... bye.
-Thank you very much.
- Welcome, sir.
- And thanks to you also.
- Thank you, sir.
l really appreciate your help.
Thank you very much.
Well done, Karthik.
You handled that like a pro.
Thank you, sir.
Actually, you know,
you are over qualified for this job.
You should be some where else
in a bigger firm...
No, sir... l like it here.
Peace of mind is essential
and l found it here in Cochin.
You're one strange fellow.
And l keep telling you that!
- Karthik...
- Yes, sir.
- Sit... sit...
- No, sir... it's okay.
I’m going to Dubai next week
and l need to be in touch with you.
We'll be in touch on email, sir.
l need you to get a phone.
Karthik?
- Phone, Karthik...
- Sir...
it’s not necessary, sir.
What do you mean?
You neither have
a mobile nor a landline.
No, no... l insist!
You have to get a phone.
Please, sir, l don't want a phone.
Sir, l have a problem with mobiles.
Then get a landline!
- Landline, sir?
- Karthik...
I’m not asking you,
I’m telling you.
You said you want
payment in cash, l agreed.
You said you won't travel,
l agreed.
You said you won't go to
the Mumbai head office, l agreed.
Won't you agree to this request?
Come on, get a landline, quick!
- Yes, we will allot the number now...
but the wireman will come tomorrow.
We are out of handsets,
you'll need to buy your own.
Please do me a favour.
Don't print my number in the directory.
l want to keep it private.
Mention it in the form
and it will be done.
And don't even tell me the number.
But it will be printed on the bill.
Then don't send the bill.
What?
If you wish, I’ll pay
the yearly charge in advance.
l don't want a bill.
Actually, l don't want to
know the number either.
You could write it on a paper.
Sir, my telephone number.
Sir...
please don't tell anyone.
Not even me.
- You don't know your own number?
- No, sir.
You really are strange!
Why are you thinking so much?
- You're selecting a phone, not a bride!
l don't get any calls.
Only if you buy a phone,
will you know if anyone calls.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Everything is fine now, Shonali.
I’m free from the calls.
Sorry for what happened.
Maybe some day
we can be together again.
- Kavita...
- Yes?
Can you please book me
a ticket to Mumbai for tomorrow?
Hi... I’m Shonali.
Hi, Shonali, I’m Shweta.
When you called you said,
you've news about Karthik.
In fact l just received an email today,
after a long time.
Okay, l need you to
tell me something.
Sure!
Did Karthik have a brother?
Of course not.
And you're sure about this?
Absolutely!
l met his sister, his cousin sister.
She told me a lot about him.
Karthik is an only child.
He has no brother.
My suspicions were aroused.
About what?
Since childhood he has been disturbed.
Karthik thought he had a brother.
And he came to me,
due to the guilt about his death but...
his brother wasn't real.
l had to suffer Kumar's taunts,
his anger everyday.
Mom and dad never believed
that he troubled me.
They never believed me.
He never did anything in their presence.
Shonali...
Karthik is schizophrenic.
- Karthik's parents
didn't believe him because...
only Karthik saw his brother.
- He was imaginary.
How is it related to the phone calls??
the 'Karthik' who calls
is imaginary.
A figment of his imagination.
Imagination??
But I’ve seen the phone ring!
I’m not saying
the phone calls don't come .
All I’m saying is
this person that Karthik talks to...
is created by Karthik's mind.
Didn't you speak with him??
Exactly!
And l got fooled too.
But l kept wondering,
how the voice l had heard...
could be Karthik's.
And then a few days ago,
l came across this.
- Please set time.
- Time set five a.m.
Please record message.
Remember me, Karthik?
Did you think...
that I’d let you be?
You're going to wish you were dead!
And now,
I’m going to get you, Karthik.
l found you.
- Message saved.
- Karthik used to call himself?
Oh my God!
It has many amazing features.
Alarm, calendar, self reminder...
If you want to remember something...
dial O-O-2-6 and
record a message in your own voice.
This will be recorded on the handset.
- A reminder for anything.
- You can even set the timer.
Say you want a reminder at nine a.m.
before leaving for work.
-The phone will ring at nine sharp!
- When you answer,
you can hear the message.
If you wish, you can record
a message for others too.
Please listen to me.
You never let me speak, please...
- Even if the phone is dead,
the features will work.
- Because this phone works on batteries.
-And if you don't record a new message,
it won't ring.
- Oh my God!
He needs help.
l need to get to him.
l need a flight to Cochin,
a night flight will do.
- But where is he?
- His email contained
the address of a courier company.
I’ll figure out the rest.
- Our brain is unique, very complex.
- Things we want to remember...
- what we think about, talk about...
- get stored in one part of the mind.
- the conscious mind.
-And those little things,
that we don't really focus on...
- what we see, hear
but can't remember...
- are stored in another part.
- the subconscious mind.
- The subconscious mind is
a very strange thing.
- Everything is stored there.
- It knows how we think...
- what we think,
what questions we'll ask...
What do you want to know?
The colour of your socks?
- Our personal things,
our secrets...
Your bank PIN number is 1-2-7-6.
- It's because the
conscious and subconscious mind...
- are both present in the same brain.
Wife?
Why did you call on this number?
l already told you...
when l come  to Delhi,
I’ll visit Bunty's school.
- Several different personalities can
exist in one brain.
- In Karthik's case,
the other Karthik who calls.
- His alter ego...
- and Karthik probably doesn't know this.
- No one knows how severe
this problem can be.
- the mind can act in very twisted ways.
- It's very rare but...
- l think Karthik could actually be...
- suffering from
multiple mental disorders, Shonali.
Hello...
Remember me, Karthik?
Did you think...
that I'd let you be?
You thought you were safe from me?
No, Karthik.
Now you are finished.
See how I ruin your life.
You're going to wish
you were dead, Karthik.
Did you think...
that l wouldn’t find you in Cochin?
Guess what?
You were wrong.
Again!
I found you
And now, I'm going to get you.
With you I am, by your side...
Not a memory, you cast by the wayside...
I'm always around...
Be there gladness or sorrow...
Every moment, I have you with me...
This is how it was meant to be...
At every corner and every step...
I'm there, in every breath...
With you I'll always abide...
I'm always around...
Be there gladness or sorrow...
Believe it or not, you are my own...
It's time you realise my being...
Time you accept you need me...
I just can’t let you be...
I complete you, why can’t you see?
I'm always around...
Be there gladness or sorrow...
Believe it or not, you are my own...
Hello...
Yes, Dr Kapadia...
Karthik...
Karthik?
it’s Dr Kapadia for you.
- Karthik, You need to do this.
Hello...
- Karthik...
- l thought, I’d call and wish you.
- Happy Birthday!
Thank you.
- How have you been?
I’m better, thanks.
- You're coming over
to see me on Monday, aren't you?
Yes... absolutely.
- Great! Take care.
- Happy birthday, once again.
Thanks.
Bye.
