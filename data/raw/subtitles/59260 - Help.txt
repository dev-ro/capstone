In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble
Whose name is the Terrible
Whose name is Baleful.
Whose name is Inaccessible
Whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness.
We turn our hearts to Kaili
Drinker of blood, black mother
Killer of demons, gorge
on this flesh, our offering
Thering. She is not
wearingthe sacrificial ring
She cannot be sacrificed
withoutthering.
Where is the ring?
Whathas she done with he ring?
Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! You know I need someone
Help!
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please please help me?

Help me, help me oom
- Shocking
- Monstruous
The necessary preparations...
- The preparations for my immediate departure...
- Are made
Thering. Over the water
wemust go. Bhuta.
- You ask of me, Master
- Obedience and Love
This isso
- The ring
- Hasnobody looked on the washbasin?
I am making the immediate
arrangements necessary for...
- My visit to England
- In hand and already waiting
Without the ring no sacrifice
without the sacrifice no congregation...
without a congregation
no more me
This is so
- Wave
- Idon't like to
They expect it, don't they...
Lovely lads and so natural
Adoration hasn't gone to their heads
So natural and still the same
as they was before
- Hey someone got hold ofmy finger...
- Are you tryingto attract attention again
She's pulling at it.
Had my finger, you know...
Stop trying to drag things down
to your own level
I thought she was a sandwich until
she went spare on my hand
It's a cold place
- So, Thering?
- I could not get it off
Have you been messing with me
in my sleep?
I mean, with a fishing rod
I wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?
I'm tired
Hey, Bea-atle!
How about this, Shufti?
Pure gold in easy to handle
denominational nuggets
- Not a mark on them
- No, I hate them...
It makes your fingers go green.
It's not the Beatle with the ring
- Aren't I?
- No, unfortunately
Hey Bea-atle
You shall have fun, eh?
No thanks, I'm rhythm guitar
and mouth organ
I didn't encourage that wink...
It's not the one...
My gosh, they all look the same
Swami, it's raining and...
After them...
Quickly, quickly
- All in
- All in together now, sir
- What?
- Shilling
In the weeks that followed
five more attemps
were made to steal the ring
- What was it that first attracted you tome?
- Well... you're very polite
Hope he's in
- What are you doing?
- Posting a letter.
I am not what I seem
My skin's soaked right through
to the skin...
There's more here than meets the eye
Everyone laughs at Ringo's
sudden apprehension
But the very next day
"You're going to lose that girl"
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
If you don't take her out tonight
She's gonna change her mind (she's gonna change her mind)
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind (I'm gonna treat her kind)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
If you don't treat her right my friend
You're gonna find her gone (you're gonna find her gone)
'Cause I will treat her right and then
You'll be the lonely one (you're not the only one)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
I'll make a point of taking her away from you (watch what you do) yeah
The way you treat her, what else can I do?
(You're gonna lose that girl)
(You're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
I'll make a point of taking her away from you (watch what you do) yeah
The way you treat her, what else can I do?
If you don't take her out tonight
She's gonna change her mind (she's gonna change her mind)
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind (I'm gonna treat her kind)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose (yes yes you're gonna lose that girl)
- Boys, are you buzzing?
- No thanks, I've got the car
You'll have to do it again.
- Is that you?
- No
Don't look at me
You naughty boy
- Flee
- Who are you?
Will you explain everything when
the opportunity presents itself?
Sex is creeping in.
Young people see it in the
bazaars, market places, temple
No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...
We're taking up fox hunting so that the young
people can be involved in their own sacrifices
Can you understand the deep significance
of bloodwell shed?
Of course I don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...
What... who... where...
Now... if you'll pardon me
seeking enlightenement as to ring
they approached the nearest oriental
You know rings... It's yours
My miss us wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious...
- He's from the west
- No, east Stepney
- Does this ring mean anything to you...
- Freemason?
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
We have got one in there from the
mystic east... Hey Abdul!
That lad from the sunnier climat
east of Suez?
Very nice he was, too
I think he's still down there in the
coal hole
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
Aren't these spices expensive?
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
- Isn't this ring nasty, sir?
- Kaili! I must lie down
This menu...
There's a man down there on his head
Could you pick this up for me, please?
Are you eating, too, Paul?
Your friend is in mortal danger.
I can say no more
It's rather a jolly place
Soup, please
He has three more hours to live
I can say no more...
I ordered soup too.
That's a very fascinating ring
you have got there
Thedreaded secret sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili
If he is to be scrificed before Kaili,
why is not painted red?
I've never had the courage to
ask him, but as he's my best friend I will...
- What's this?
- Glasses
The victims offered to Kaili every day
are happy to go
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring all day
and at the end of the happy day he
is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
And sacrificed jolly with a knife
- You have until five o'clock
- Before a new victim is chosen
You are a lucky! My old mum
would give her right hand to be chosen.
- What's this?
- A season ticket
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup...
There's somebody been in this soup
I got it from this Eastern bird lady
in a fan letter
I get all sorts of rubbish.
The sacrifice? ...No?
Come off!
So send back the ring to this lady
who will then be happy to die for Kaili
There's a footprint in here
Here, you have ago...
Next.The nearest ring specialist
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
This ring is not stone.
- I've only got three hours tolive.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
- I don't know this metal
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
Early days yet, sir
Therefore it must be an alloy
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved, my life is in danger...
Three ten
- The wheel
- Not the wheel
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
- I've never seen anything like it
- Jeweler, you've failed
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind of specialist? Your tools are broken
The fire brigade once got my
head out of some railings
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when l wasn't at school
You can see a lot of the
world from railings
finally undismayed.
the nearest specialist.
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook
This won't work
It could work if the government
would spend some more money
Made in American cheap
Another failure
We expand the molecules and
the ring grows bigger and drops off
- What's your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil
It's not dropping off
Voltage... up, up, up
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on, thank you
Made in America.
Way ahead of anything you've got
- Is it green, the earth in America
- In some places it's brown, you know
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork
- 5... 4...
- Come on
3-2-1-go! I like to observe the procedure.
You'll  thank me for it in the end
Rád bych sledova ten proces.
Na konci mi za to podìkujete.
Scientist, you're getting nowhere
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
All this America ring.
Wrong voltage
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands
- Will he still be able to drum ok?
- Did he do a lot of it?
The voltage, up, up, up
jetì, jetì, víc, víc.....
- Do bunkru!!!
- I can't watch
- It's working! Give me the gun, Algernon
Stop it!
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant
This is outrageous! You're nothing
but a mad scientist!
Fantastic! With this ring
I could rule the world!
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the police!
- Get him off
- I must have this ring. The laser...
Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting
Switch off that machine
I'm better with animals
than with plugs and transformers
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them
který po mì chce zajistit
vládu nad svìtem
Daddy being the local master of the hounds,
that's where I got my love of animals from
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection
How do we know we can trust her
he's had the old fingers before
Well, there was a mistake.
I can vouch for her; we're very close
- Lasers ready
- Get them
It's the wrong plug...
lf you just give me five minutes
It's the brain drain
His brain's draining
Here I stand, head in hand, turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on, feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare each and every day
I can see them laugh at me and I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try? I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them in the state I'm in
How could she say to me "love will find a way"?
Gather round all you clowns, let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
I have here...
Now see what you've
done with your filthy eastern ways...
It is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways
How do we know you're not just as filthy
and sent by him to nick the ring
- What filthy ways are these
- You can put that away
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili
Now my sister is safe and rises up
And a new day dawns...
and a new victim is chosen...
From this moment
it is death to him who wears the ring.
This will make your finger shrink
Be brave
don´t move
If he were brave
this would not be necessary
End Of Part One
Intermission
End Of Intermission
part two
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.
You're as bad as your sister
coming home from work at all hours and all colors
endo of part two
part three
later that evening
- There might be some insurance
- I wouldn't think of such a thing
Where did you say that stuff is?
This will just make his finger shrink a little.
It's a minor medical secret
I'm sure there's no call for all this
I'm allergic to Penicillin
and all them other wonder drugs
Are you sure it's not
main lining or habit forming
Not as long as you don't swallow it
All right. Synchronize your watches
You, you, you and you.
Make him red and then kill him
I promise you the effect is purely transitory
It wears off very quickly
Don't answer it. It can only be Clang
- Perhaps it won't take
- This is a dreadful miscarriage
Where's Paul?
- Where are you, Paul?
- This is his best suit
The Exciting Adventure
Of Paul on the floor
Don't look right or left.
They might take us for innocent by standers
Standby
They are at the door!
go!
Get me the homeoffice
- It's me, you fool
- Oh sorry
Kaili! He's red! Kill him!
Withdraw!
- Which one has the ring?
- That one with the large nose
It's yours
- Keep your hands up
- How can I get it off with my hands held up
In the name of science
I demand that ring
It's worth something
Had to do all this myself you know...
On Wall Street they call me Backward Britain
With a ring like that I could
interest the military.
No, I could not.
I can't get it off
- Look, what you've done
- Hey, is that Paul?
Algernon, my little black bag.
I shall have to operate
It'll be on the
national health, won't it?
Ugh, I'm still sticky.
You're all red!
- We thought that was you
- No that's not me
I'm glad it wore off quickly
What are doing?
Get out!
British stuff is useless.
If I had a Luger...
Their scientists are properly equipped
The remedy is in your hands...
you, the voters
Where's Ahme?
I don't understand a word
I don't speak the language
Latin yes. But this Easternbabble no.
Meanwhile, seemingly safe
in the sheltering ups
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care
She said that living with me was bringing her down yeah
She would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care
I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
Ah she's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care
I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
She said that living with me was bringing her down yeah
She would never be free when I was around
Ah she's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care...
Wait for me
The bloods rushing to my head
Put me down
Put me down
Thank you
I'm easing the fuse in now
I know, you fool.
I'm here. Steady
I am steady
Now a turn to the right and it locks
I am turning it to the right. It is locking
- That's what comes of teaching science by television
- You'll thank me in the end
I am lifting it up
I am moving my left leg
- I am moving my right leg
- Give it to me
When the ice breaks dive straight in.
It's the right hand
Soft fame... broom sticks
Thank you
- Hey, it's a thing
- A fiendish thing
Run, Ringo
Useless... ex army rubbish
Excuse me... white cliffs of Dover?
Bhuta, here they come the right flank
In the name of Kaili, stop
My blood group is very unusual
Look!
I'm very busy... please!
Perhaps if we gave away free tickets
to the youth organization annual sacrifice...
all this could be avoided.
It's a very real problem
They have to paint me red first
it's a different religion
- So this is the famous ring
- I'm in fear of my life you know?
- So this is the famous Beatles
- So this is the famous Scotland Yard
- How long do you think you'll last?
- The Great Train Robbery... how's that going?
You don't believe us, do you?
It's for you, the famous Ringo
Only me and Paul know we're here
I know...
Allow me... l'm a bit of a famous mimic
You know... James Cagney...
Hello there this is the famous Ringo,
what is it that I cando for you
Not a bit like Cagney
Go to the window
There's a strong case for arming the police
We're not all masochists
- Now see?
- Yes, I believe you
Let's get going.
Pass me the phone, will you
Last 9 at the service.
Call 999
We need protection.
We've got a record to do tomorrow
I need the protection
And you shall have it.
Get me protection
You don't realise how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me, I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me
I didn't realise as I looked in your eyes
You told me
oh yes you told me you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you
But when you told me you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you, I need you, I need you
Hello... Sunray
Hello Sunray
What are you doing down there?
It is done we are directly under...
listen...
Ugh, shocking
Ahme, return to the base.
Take this hastily scribbled note
hastily to acting Lance Corporal
It says standing by
They shall not pass...
We said our goodbyes (ah the night before)
Love was in your eyes (ah the night before)
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Were you telling lies (ah the night before)?
Was I so unwise (ah the night before)?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
We said our goodbyes (ah the night before)
Love was in your eyes (ah the night before)
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
Were you telling lies (ah the night before)?
Was I so unwise (ah the night before)?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before
I regret losing an lieutenant
as able as Ahme
- Loaded
- Well, fire the nasty thing
Missed! You naughty boys
A well known palace
- How's you equlibrium?
- How's yours... your light again, George
- How do you know it's not you that's light
- 'Cause I never am
Caught this with one hand!
- Ugly, aren't they...
- The hands?
- Some people's are
- Showus your hand, Ringo
You want to chuck one in?
How about drumming?
Have you thought of that?
I don't know many...
It appears I need one card...
- Very lighthearted
- Discarding it like an old boot
They're talking about your
finger, you know
- Will you hold this drumstick
- There's a good drummer in Manchester
Well, I don't just drum
with it, do I?
Quite a good-looking fellow, too
I'll raise you
You haven't used that finger in the past
hour and we're all in danger
Me and Paul haven't seen you make
any use of that finger lately
We're risking our lives to preserve a
useless member.
I've always admired that friend of Scott's;
the way he went out into the snow for his mates
Just hold this drumstick
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet, haven't you?
- Well, I've got a good hand
- You must have five aces.
- Do you wanna see me?
- You're joking... take it
I will see... I've won it
Tea!
They expect me to cut my finger off
The famous finger, eh?
So the police give their famous protection
for a finger, eh?
What's that...
It's haunted, you know...
- Are you going to cut?
- No, I'm not going to cut and that's it
This wing of the palace is haunted
- We're never going to leave this palace alive
- The Queen will have something to say about that.
What's that?
- That thing coming through his stomach
- I won't look
It's only a hose
- It's for you
- It's the gardener
I'll stick it out the window
Must be their tea break
It's me, you fool
This should work;
it's from Harvard
- It looks like a laser
- It's a relativity cadenza
That should slow them down a bit
Hurry up with the plug,
I'll align the sights
I think it is a laser
A Well Known Power Station
A royal fuse has just blown
I bet it was the hair dryer
she got for Christmas
There followed one more fiendish
attempt on poor Ringo's Life
Come on, get them,
I'm with you
Two lagers and lime
and two lagers and lime, please
- Looks like it's me again
- Everything's relative, you know
- Well, you didn't miss your tonsils
- How do you know?
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?
I've had some great time with this
finger, and I'd miss it
- You're a rat underneath
- You can have a fire and theft policy for it
It's because you're a Beatle
that your fingers wasn't on it
- Is there a cure for nail biting?
- Oh yes
I'm always getting winked at
these days
Oh, Sorry Ringo
All the rungs have been
neatly sawn in the middle
- Your famous Ringo is safe
- No, he isn't
- Don't move
- You heard what she said
Do you know Beethoven's
9th symphony?
It goes like this
It'st he famous Bengal man-eater
who escaped from the zoo this morning
He's harmless. All you have todo is
sing Beethoven'sOde to Joy
- Why didn't you think of that!
- He was reared on the classics
Don't worry, just whistle famous
Beethoven's famous 9th symphony
We're not going there
- We just put it round we're going there
- We're not going there
- We just put it round we're going there
- So that everybody thinks we were going there
- Where are we going then?
- Never you mind
And so they found themselves in...
The Bahamas
And so did
Him!
And so did
Welcome to Nassau
I'd like to present F.C.17 BC6,
PO 47 PO63 PO9 PO85...
And so did
You should have thought
of that before we left the house
Shore, port, starboard!
For I have got another girl, another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop
For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl, another girl, another girl
Beatles, Hello!
Clang had the whole temple
transported here for your sacrifice.
He needn't have bothered
- What's this?
- This is where you will be disemboweled
You don't go for all that,
do you?
- Do you know Clang?
- I'm his mother and he'sa good boy
I don't want to knock
anyone'sreligion, but...
- In here, quickly
- Ican't swim
Let's go back and
get them!
Let's find that temple
Aman's got to do
what he's got to do
- Let's go back and get them
- They'll disembowel us
Not if I get the boot in first.
They won't disembowel us;
you see, that's all gab - disemboweling...
Signpost?
Guide book?
Feet?
Red light
Green light, go!
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries
There must be an
easier way to set a trap!
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue
- What does he say?
Passing this way with
hot foot to the temple
- You've got the part, Paul
- Dare we ask how you know?
- The footprints, the guidebook...
- To the temple
After them... slowly!
- That's not it
- It's on the map as being here
That temple on the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
and I'm lost!
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never in a million years
That's an old army place, a
well-known retreat for courting couple
- Aren't we going in?
- No, let's not
Oh come on lads,
where's that famous courage?
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Iwill have
- I'm off
- Typical!
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension
There's one on the back,
but it's not the right one
This is no time for foolish
tricks! This is a hired car
Back up and smash him off
This should give him
a headache
- That's done it, he's gone
- I can't start the car
I seem to be having
a slight difficulty
I think it might be
the wrong key
Thanks forthe lift,
sailor!
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished into thin air
Superintendent, you've got
a plan, haven't you?
But even the best laid plans...
little do they know he's a prisoner
I'm a perfect surgeon
scalpel
Sand in the generator.
It gets everywhere
No wonder I never get anywhere
Fix it, Algernon
You wouldn't want me
to go in with a blunt scalpel
I'm a decent employer, and he
takes advantage of me. It's the heat...
I've got some juice
I can't understand it.
They kept pulling my nose
Distilled from the essence
of orchids
What's that?
Distilled from the essence
of orchids found only in deep dark recesses?
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Tiberius Foot Juice!
Who needs the ring now
that I have this
This is the Nobel Prize juice
Set sail for England
The government in the palm
of my hand. What's it say?
- I don't know. It's in Eastern
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
I can't swim
Treacherous Woman,
tremble...
In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains...
You wait till my mates
get you
I don't think so...
we've had two
battalions flown in to ambush your friends
They're quite merciless...
One word of warning from
you and you die instantly
I'm going to miss the sacrifice
It came off! I'm saved!
Get sacrificed!
- It came off! I just showed courage
- How many fingers have you got left?
- You're all red again
- I'm beginning to like it.
He who wears the ring...
