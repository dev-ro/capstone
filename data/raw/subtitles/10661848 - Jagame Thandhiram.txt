Captain.
A border patrol boat is here.
Hey everybody, patrol! Get down, get down.
This is HMS Relentless.
You have unlawfully
entered the restricted waters.
Your boat shall be detained.
What's happening?
Women and children
will be offloaded first.
Everyone else must stay back.
What are they saying?
Women and children will be alighted first,
all others have to stay back
for questioning.
- Help us!
- Please!
Wow!
Hey, you think we are on a vacation?
Dumb asshole!
Yet again proving yourself
to be an amateur.
Just chuck him out.
Hey, freaking... Just calm down, you two.
Hello!
Hey!
Somebody's on the phone for you,
says your phone is off.
Hello, you what?
Now screw you, mate, you prick.
What the hell are you doing
calling my bird's phone?
No, no. Fuck you.
I'll be back.
He's here. Get ready.
Oh, you pricks.
Hey, get ready. He's moving.
- Paddington.
- Alright, come on.
- Let's go.
- Bro, he took the cab.
- Be quick, let's follow him.
- Bro, quick.
What the hell are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
- One minute, mate.
- One minute? What do you mean one minute?
- I got to take a piss.
- You got to take a piss?
I'll be 20 seconds.
Hey! Come back, you prick.
Freaking wanker.
Hello, hello. Check, check.
Hello, Mathew.
Who the hell is that?
Hello.
Good morning, Mathew.
Kitano.
Fuck you!
Hello, Mathew.
This message is for you.
Sivadoss says, "Goodbye."
Goddammit.
Does it look fake?
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?
Hi, Dheepan!
Finally, they got you, dude.
Maddy's gang, my foot.
What did Sivadoss Brother say?
Sivadoss Brother asked us
to break his bones
and ship them away.
Can you please hold for a minute, bro?
Wanna share good news with
our brother, and then let's belt him.
- Where is Sivadoss Brother?
- In the basement.
Four of my friends were shot down.
So, my parents found a way
to send me out of the country.
First, I reached India,
but they denied my refugee status.
From there to Nepal, and then
I reached London after so much struggle.
I definitely need a refugee status here.
Or I won't be able to live peacefully.
Just the truth is not going
to get you a refugee status.
You will need to convince them
that this is the truth.
Only then will you be allowed
to live here legally.
- Teach him.
- You have to emote better my friend.
Job's done, brother,
with a bomb devised
in our country's style.
- What about our informant, his girlfriend?
- We will get her.
So the job isn't done after all, is it?
Beginning.
A new beginning.
What the fuck are you doing, mate?
- Get off the car, mate.
- Hey! Move it.
Get the fuck out of my way, man.
Move the car.
Move the car.
- Move the car, man.
- Who the hell is this guy?
- It's Peter. Peter Sprott.
- Move, move! Go!
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Let's go, let's go!
Bloody immigrants.
Mat said he didn't want us hangin' around.
Why?
She said...
he wants some privacy or something.
Oh, yeah! Privacy?
Well, isn't that lovely?
Want it nice and private?
You want privacy?
Yes?
Or no?
Apparently...
she wants privacy.
Some fucking "me time."
Maybe you better go in and...
run her a bath.
Light some scented fucking candles.
You know...
You're a fuckin' tit.
That's pure cashmere.
Sorry, boss.
Here!
I didn't think they'd kill him.
Please, I didn't...
Nice one, bro!
- That's extraordinary, bro.
- You nailed it.
This is a game of thrones, kid.
Aren't you ashamed of crying?
Suruli, this isn't right.
Of course it is,
I always play by the rules.
I'm not talking about the game.
It's really getting late.
- Your mom is going to kill me.
- My mom, really?
Why would you want to play now?
He’s right.
Your consummation is in an hour.
Come again?
Your consummation.
Do you know what it means?
What's so funny about that?
It's to celebrate
with the families of the bride and groom.
Your word sounds right,
but I'm sure that's a different word.
I've heard this word in a famous film.
Bro, I think you mean, "betrothal."
Little brats!
A betrothal means a license to sex.
Parama, chase them away.
Get lost, Kids.
- This is unfair, bro.
- Just leave quietly.
I think the kid was right,
it's "betrothal."
No, it's "consummation," trust me.
- Is it?
- Yes.
I still doubt it.
Hello, Suruli.
He's in the second coach. Finish it quick,
else I may lose my job.
Okay, brother.
Greetings, madam!
Greetings, sir!
Hey, Rahul!
Drinking is injurious to health,
don't you guys ever listen?
Who the hell are you?
You!
This is the only shirt I've got
for tonight's function.
My mom will definitely kill me now.
Suruli, let me quickly fix it.
Hey, get me some liquor
to remove the stain.
- You've spoiled the shirt!
- Sorry, Suruli.
Get lost.
- Go there.
- Come here.
Suruli, don't do anything stupid.
If my brother finds out...
I'm just doing this to get his attention.
Here, why don't you give him a call?
- Yeah, Rahul?
- Brother!
- Suruli is threatening...
- Give it to me.
Hello... Rahul?
- Hello?
- Anil Sir!
I'm going to kill your brother.
If you don't want to face the same fate,
I suggest you pack and leave our turf.
Don't you touch him, Suruli.
I will hunt you down and your boss.
Hey!
My boss did warn you.
All of a sudden you came down to
our place, encroached our territory,
used our people as cheap laborers,
and started earning millions.
You leave us with no option.
If you want a fight,
I'm ready to wage war.
Anytime, bring it on, buddy.
I will convey this to your brother
before pulling the trigger.
Hello, Suruli!
Suruli, please, bro, forgive me.
Let me live.
Brother, please forgive me.
For the sake of my family,
please do spare me.
Please don't kill me. I'll make amends.
Please, bro.
You wanna live?
All right. Here's your chance.
All you gotta do is answer
one simple question.
What's the difference between
consummation and betrothal?
Betrothal is a sitcom
my mother watches every night at eight.
Consummation is a sex health show
I watch after midnight.
You're a duffer!
Incompetent idiot!
By saying the right answer,
you did a grave mistake in your life.
I therefore gift you four bullets!

Shut up and listen to those
Who tell you how!
You live like they tell you to
You talk like they tell you to
You do like they tell you to
You lie like they tell you to
Phew!
Suruli, are you out of your mind?
Now tell me, who the hell are they?
When I needed them
Where the hell were they?
Listen up, I’m my own king!

An antecedent enmity resulted
in the brutal murder of Rahul...
Did Ramesh take the fall
for killing Rahul?
Yes, as he was in need
of one million rupees.
Okay.
Anil did shit his pants.
It was such a shame.
Every one of them is seeking revenge.
You should've stuck to the plan
and finished the job silently.
Instead, you created a ruckus
with his brother,
and got yourself into this deep shit.
Theerthamalai Brother,
nobody dares to touch me.
You're not invincible.
Let's not risk anything.
Tomorrow, I'll arrange a safe house
for you and your bride
to stay in after marriage.
Do you want me to run and hide
like a coward?
We should be the ones chasing them away,
but you are asking me to hide?
I can just wipe them off the earth.
Shall I end this now?
- Whom are you calling a thug?
- Your son is a thug.
He's a respectful restaurateur
in the city.
He ain't a thug.
How dare you speak about my son like that?
Mom!
What's it now?
Suruli, you are a thug, it seems.
They say that you even
committed a murder yesterday.
The dim-witted bride of yours
believed it and ran away.
I knew from day one
that she isn't the one for you.
The face is the index of the mind.
She's got the worst voice in this world.
Don't you worry, Suruli.
I will get a beautiful bride for you.
- Let her rot in hell...
- Sister, just calm yourself.
Suruli, your "betrothal"
is off to a flying start!
One of my friends, Vicky,
works and lives in London.
He has come here to dine in our restaurant
with his foreign friend.
Here, a foreigner?
The best kothu-parotta
and mutton chukka in the whole of India.
- Serve them guys.
- Sure, bro.
- Tasty parotta, come and sit.
- This way, sir.
- Please be seated, sir.
- Can you step out for a second?
Just need to take a picture
to hang on the wall.
- Definitely.
- Only with the foreigner.
Bro, I'm also from London.
Need a set of parottas.
Get parottas for table number six.
Sir, why don't you eat more?
I'm on a diet, Suruli.
- The police are here.
- Let's wait.
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, sir.
This is very famous here,
and it'll be very tasty,
you should dip it...
Hey, is this the way to eat?
First, tear the parotta to pieces,
pour the gravy on it,
and let the pieces soak in the gravy...
Get the weapons.
Just one guy! Finish him off.
Cancel the order for table number six!
Get him!
Get him fast.
Damn! They have opened fire.
Come on, let's go upstairs.
Quick, fire it.
SURULI
FOOD CLUB
Oh, my. They are firing.
I’ve never seen a gun in my life.
Kill him, man!
Cover me, guys. I will assemble a bomb.
I'm dead meat today.
All because of you, man...
- What am I gonna tell my girlfriend?
- Shut up!
Here! Come over this side!
- Does he have a foreign cigarette?
- Please give him a cigarette.
What the hell is he doing?
Here, man!
Sir...
- Light it up.
- Yes, sir.
Kill him, man!
He's mad! Run for your life!
That's our man, go and get him.
What? Go and get him?
He's throwing bombs, not fruit!
Sure, brother.
What's up?
It was Anil's gang who made the attempt.
Boss wants us to stay out of sight
for a month.
In the meantime,
he'll straighten things out.
We don't have any other choice.
It's too dangerous here.
What the hell are they doing here?
By the time these two stepped in,
there was already a bad omen.
Vicky's an old friend of mine.
Just hear him out.
I think you will like what he has to say.
Hey!
Go ahead.
In software companies, they conduct
appraisal group discussions every year.
And despite all your year's hard work,
your fate will be decided
on how you present yourself
in that meeting.
In one such meeting,
the topic was about
the best gangster in Tamilnadu.
Needless to say, I was on top of everyone.
Our Suruli is a gangster back home
who is the most dangerous,
notorious, arrogant gangster
you've ever seen in your life...
I don't think
what you're saying is right...
What has he done? Thirty-five murders.
I personally know him, man,
I personally know him...
Suruli is the best gangster
in the world, man.
Try to understand that.
Do I look like a fool?
Sir, who is he?
This is our real powerful big boss.
Hello, sir. I'm Vicky.
Who is this guy Suruli?
In short,
to decode and destabilize
the Tamil gangster Sivadoss in London,
Peter wants to recruit a Tamil gangster
with a unique skill set.
This is the purpose of my visit, sir.
So I humbly request you to
tender your consulting services
and travel with us to London.
What? Is he convinced?
It's just a month's work with a huge pay.
How much do you earn?
Two hundred thousand pounds.
A month?
No, a year.
I need to earn the same.
No way you can match my pay.
I'm a software testing lead.
An engineering graduate as well!
Oh, is that so?
I need to earn the same, but monthly.
Are you out of your mind?
He might get offended!
- Will he get offended?
- Obviously.
I need to earn the same, weekly.
Weekly?
That's more than ten million in rupees...
Shut up and ask him.
Two hundred thousand pounds per week.
He lost his fucking mind!
Tell him we'll pay him.
What happened?
Let me catch my breath
just for a couple of bucks' increment,
I have to bend the world.
But, this guy has just agreed
to two hundred thousand pounds!
That's great news.
Suruli, he has agreed.
You're a millionaire now.
Looks like I'm a millionaire now!
A million rupees!
Looks like we're worth a lot
on foreign soil.
Let's move there and earn more.
London's your new home!
- Is it?
- Yes!
A Tamil gangster in the streets of London!
Sir!
Suruli Sir!
Oh, my god!
Looks bigger than
our village president's house.
That's an unfair comparison.
Looks like he's coming down,
please be quiet.
Everyone has their own problems!
You must be Surlee.
Have a seat.
It's not pronounced "Surlee."
It's Suruli. Say it!
Right, Suruli.
Welcome to Britain.
You might be aware that a lot of people
around here don't like gentlemen with a...
brown persuasion coming here
to steal our jobs,
but I know John explained
our situation nice and clear...
In my place, they used to
mock someone with "Peter"
if they speak only in English.
Now I understand why they use "Peter."
My dear Peter.
Right, let's get to business.
This Sivadoss is the only
known member of the gang.
The rest belong to some sort
of strange, secret brown world.
Sivadoss is the only
known member of the gang...
We wiped a couple of them
just to show we were serious,
but it didn't get us anywhere.
They maintain a low profile,
like a secret society...
Just add a little bit of spice.
They all look brown.
Then the bastards killed Mathew.
What do you mean "they all look brown?"
And that's what lead to this...
Please speak slowly.
Can you go a little slower?
I'm not able to follow you.
Please repeat what you said.
The last few lines, please.
British English is fast, you know.
So, if you go slow, slow, slow,
I will tell him fast, fast, fast.
You have got one fucking job to do.
And you do it or you're out, yeah.
'Cause you wouldn't like
your severance package.
And I'll sever something
you are very fond of.
Is that...
...slow...
...enough...
...for you?
- Yeah, slow enough.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry, lads.
I get a bit tense.
You know, when Millwall are playing,
but they're up one-nil at half-time.
So it's all cool. Fine.
Let's start again.
- So this Sivadoss is the only...
- Oh, okay...
Suruli Sir, you need to play along with me
as if you understand whatever I say.
- ...strange secret brown world...
- Okay...
I'm recording his conversation
on my phone.
We can go over it line by line
at my place.
If you don't play along,
he's gonna castrate me.
Please stop it.
This isn't working. I'm leaving now.
Whatever Peter says,
ask John to take notes and give them to
us.
And I will read that when I get the time.
My sincere apologies, sir.
My friend Suruli is feeling
a bit jet-lagged.
And he has asked John
to take all the notes
and I will explain after he's rested.
Sir, please.
Sir, please. Sir, no. Please.
Thank God, it's just a phone!
Call me on this when your boy's rested.
Nobody needs to know
that we got business together.
- You, look after him.
- Okay, sir.
Make sure he stays with you.
- What did he say?
- He wants you to take some rest.
- So you have a girlfriend.
- Yes.
What's she doing here?
She's part of the campaign management team
for Minister Andrews.
What does that mean?
Like a propaganda person.
So, is this a political party office?
No.
BICORE is a bill proposed to
restrict the entry of immigrants.
If the bill passes in Parliament,
then immigrants like us will suffer.
Minister Andrews is putting up a fight
against this bill.
My girlfriend is in the core committee
of Minister Andrews' office.
We call them loud-speakers back home!
That's hitting below the belt!
Are you offended?
Hi, baby!
- Hey, baby. I missed you so much.
- I missed you so much.
How is it possible?
Anything is possible with love, my friend.
- What?
- Love.
Let's get back to business.
How is it possible?
As I said earlier, it's pure love.
So you weren't paying attention
to the info on the gang?
No, start over.
He escapes the clutches of evil with ease
He's the king of the jungle
So don't take him lightly
As enemies surround him
He gets ready to pounce!
Hello, brother. It's been a while.
And hunts them all!
Fresh fish stocks inside.
Looks like a local mart in my city!
Yes, most of Sivadoss' men
are widespread in this area.
John says so...
How come you guys
ordered rice instead of rice batter?
Place it down and leave.
A pleasant aroma! Who is cooking?
A good wife is a gift in life...
- And your heart sings in pride
- And your heart sings in pride
- This is the kingdom of love!
- This is the kingdom of love!
I was born and brought up
in Jaffna, Sri Lanka.
The war situation has pushed us
out of the country as refugees.
This is bliss!
Brother, if you open a restaurant here,
Londoners will shower you with pounds!
Are you sure?
Yes, but you may face resistance
from local people...
But don't worry. I will take care of it.
I'm a gangster.
What's so funny about it?
You don't seem so!
Do you know Sivadoss?
He's a gangster and I'm part of his gang.
Sivadoss?
A spy is a lonely wanderer!
And he never forgives anyone!
He's waiting to show his rage
And will not rest until he succeeds!
- Hi, brother.
- Hello, Dharani.
From spined loach to local fishes,
this is the spot.
I know Rajan very well.
Let me enquire about the dry fish stock.
Aren't you tired of this chatterbox?
If you are actually smart,
you will know that
he's spilling information.
Hello, how are you?
Okay!
I see!
So, you are not here to buy fish,
but to catch one?
Are you mocking me?
I passed junior college
with flying colors,
and cleared the engineering
entrance test on par.
I scored off the charts
on IELTS, TOEFL, and GRE.
All these accomplishments,
are for me to babysit!
In the Tamil movie Nayakan, they
will translate Hindi for the protagonist.
And here, I'm doing the same
in English for you.
I'm glad that I'm in London,
unlike Nayakan.
Who is the translator in Nayakan?
Delhi Ganesh or Janagaraj?
None of them make a difference to you.
- Someone is going to sing, it seems.
- Attilla!
Hi!
Thank you and good evening, all.
So, today I'm gonna sing
a song from an Indian film
that was released in 1970.
Oh my!
She's gorgeous!
I think she's from Tamilnadu.
I'll sing only to your ears!
I'll only talk with your thoughts!
- Hey! Hey!
- It is with your eyes...
That I play with!
- Hey...
- What?
Can you keep an eye on my beer?
I will be back in a jiffy.
Get lost.
I'll sing only to your ears!
I'll only talk with your thoughts!
It is with your eyes
That I play with
I'll rest only on...
Brother Suruli!
What's it now?
They are fighting. Let's leave.
Come on, guys. Wrap it up!
Let's go.
- Hello there...
- You can't go in.
- I will just say "hi."
- Alwyn, let him speak.
- Alwyn, it's okay.
- Yeah, give some space.
Yeah, hi.
Hey!
You sang very well.
- Okay.
- Very good singing.
Thank you, are you a Tamilian?
Yes.
- From Tamilnadu?
- Aren't all Tamilians from Tamilnadu?
All Tamilians need not
necessarily be from Tamilnadu.
Okay.
I love you.
Thanks.
Hey listen, this is not a casual proposal.
I mean it seriously, let's get married.
Okay...
When can we meet...
You have to leave now.
She's from the same country as me,
just move away.
I'm warning you to move aside or else...
Come on, Kevin, get stuck in.
See, the kids these days, they don't...
They don't want to put their boot in
like we did.
You play the man and the ball.
He says the current generation of kids
isn't strong and aggressive.
That's true.
And home's gone...
forever.
'Cause of people like you
from God-knows-where.
He says his country has lost its legacy
with the invasion of immigrants, like us.
Is that so?
Was it a delight
when they invaded our country
and ruled over us for 100 years,
and took away all our wealth?
I will land in trouble
if I translate this.
Come on, you fuckers. High press!
He has got more pressing issues
at hand now.
So, let me shed some light on him.
Sir!
- Matter is this only.
- This is the information.
Sivadoss uses his ships to import weapons
from countries like Bosnia, Ukraine,
and then sells them out.
He uses a complex operation setup
to execute these deals. Very impressive!
What's impressive about that?
I've been doing that since my twenties.
He has executed the same in his twenties.
I'm not done yet.
He doesn't deal these transactions
through cash.
He's not giving anything in money...
His choice of currency is gold.
He gets it from war-torn countries.
He selectively chooses his accomplices
from different countries.
The modus operandi is weapons for gold.
Impossible to track.
The gold consumed in
this country is not 24-carat.
Hence, the gold procured
by Sivadoss is expensive here.
That's impressive.
The real smartness of Sivadoss is,
how he smuggles weapons out of the country
in exchange for gold.
The techniques used are
completely untraceable.
Sivadoss has companies
that organize Indian traditional weddings
and funeral services.
What would be the services offered
for a wedding event?
What would be the services offered
for a funeral event?
I think these companies are
his source for smuggling.
Let's target the company vehicle
to confirm the same.
Moreover, I've thorough knowledge
on all their attack techniques.
I can handle that.
He's an expert in making
country bombs, guns, and bullets.
Well, that's bloody impressive, Suruli.
He's all praises for you.
Must be that...
immigrant work ethic
they keep fucking talking about.
I can't believe my eyes.
- Is it?
- Yes.
So...
who we hitting?
What are we hitting?
Of course, a funeral.
My dear uncle!
Uncle!
Who's this guy?
No idea.
My dear uncle.
My uncle.
That was really embarrassing.
I'm clearly an odd man out there.
I barely managed to come out alive.
Brother Suruli, the Aatma
Funeral Service van is approaching.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Sivadoss' men should be driving,
so get out of their sight.
Holy crap!
John, time to move.
Okay, guys, let's go.
- Who are these guys?
- Madmen!
Get out, let's go.
He's got a gun.
Just be calm.
Please, don't shoot.
Stay in the car.
We are not gonna hurt you.
Hands up.
Down, get down now.
- Daddy, they are jokers.
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- What are you guys up to?
- Please leave us.
Get him out of here, come on.
- What are you doing?
- What are you guys doing?
You're dishonoring my late husband.
Please leave us alone.
Oh, my father!
Oh, god! What's happening here?
We have only paid half
for this lost shipment,
and he's demanding the rest now.
Why would he share
our incompetency losses?
We'll have to compensate him.
And place a new order.
Rajan, you personally
take care of the next shipment.
But one thing...
How did Peter sniff it?
I'm suspecting Maddy's gang
or postcode's gang to be involved.
Highly impossible,
they will never cross our line.
This funeral van attack puts us in a spot
where it looks like an insider job.
I don't think so.
Our guys are tigers, they aren't traitors.
- Tigers, right?
- Yes, brother.
We have to find this rat.
Looks like a new white rat!
Two hundred thousand pounds!
- This is your share.
- I don't want it.
You've earned this, take your share.
For my performance at the uncle's funeral?
Not at all.
This is an advance for you to set up
a five-minute meeting
with my angel Attilla!
- Impossible.
- Then return my money.
- It's possible, Suruli, absolutely!
- Give it back.
Your friend was convincing me for almost
two hours to set up this meeting,
but you haven't uttered a word
in the last twenty minutes.
What is this all about?
Have some water.
Are you kidding me? I'm leaving.
Hey, like I said earlier...
I love you and I want to marry you.
Hello, enough. This isn't like your films.
You don't even know me.
That's why I wanted to meet you.
So you could get to know me
in five minutes?
So, is five hours enough?
Is five days enough?
If I can't understand you in five minutes,
I can never understand you,
even after fifty years!
Haven't you heard this saying,
"Bend the twig, bend the tree"?
See, I just made you smile.
Let's take baby steps
and we will cross the bridge when...
I'm married.
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm sure this would be
shocking news for you.
But, that's a fact.
Apologies, everybody.
Please, carry on. Enjoy your meal.
I got married long back.
My husband died three years ago.
I have a seven-year-old son.
I guess you have heard enough about me.
Hope your love story ends now?
Could you please help me
to talk to someone in the kitchen?
Weren't you listening?
I knew your entire history.
In fact, I got a gift
for your son Dheeran.
- Please come with me.
- Hey!
No, sorry. Not allowed...
I want to speak to the person
who just broke the plates.
He just needs to speak to that person
who was here just now.
Murugesan.
Murugesan! Brother!
It's Suruli, from Madurai.
South Avani street corner,
Savarimuthu Parotta Shop.
Hey, Suruli!
How are you, brother?
Unbelievable!
- My old friend.
- Friend!
I still can't believe my eyes.
What are you doing here?
It's a long story!
What about you?
I thought you would've settled
and started your own business abroad.
Nothing's changed though.
Still washing dishes?
There are so many dirty plates
which need cleaning in this world.
Seeing you brings back my fond memories.
Madurai, refugee camp,
the parotta shop, Amudha...
Amudha!
- We need to catch up.
- Definitely, with a glass of wine.
This is Attilla, a good singer
and my fiance.
Is it a love marriage?
Will fall in love eventually,
but she's my fiance.
Looks like an interesting situation!
True, but that's how it is.
Hey!
Take a picture that shows
the windmill is in my hand.
A little higher.
Now, smile a bit.
Let's hit the dance floor.
This looks like a hiding place.
If you crack open all of this,
we may find gold.
I'm sure the vehicle will not
take the same route going back.
Ask him to stay alert and give us
a signal once the van leaves.
Now let's take some pictures.
A little higher.
Everything ready?
- Yeah, we're all good.
- Good!
All right. It's the same as before.
No killing, and you,
keep your mouth zipped.
Okay, shut up and get lost.
Don't do it. Three guns to one.
Not good odds.
Tell your boys to put them down.
Put down, put down.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough.
- Stop, stop!
- Don't shoot us.
- Don't shoot.
- Nobody moves, stay where you are.
- Just take it and leave.
- Sounds good.
- Get your guys in line.
- Guys, come to this side.
Come on, let's go.
Load it up.
Let's get going, come on.
Get it all together now.
Come on, let's go. Hurry it up.
That's a lot of gold.
Come on, move. Quick.
Not fucking now.
- I said not fucking...
- It's Rajan.
- What?
- Sivadoss' right-hand man.
You mean "The Rajan?"
Call Peter.
No time for Peter now.
You arrogant idiot! Just call Peter.
Are you a Tamilian?
Move it. Come on, let's go.
We never thought Peter
would have a Tamil rat.
I'd hide behind a mask too
if I sold my soul to the British devil.
You make a good point,
but the British devil pays better.
Now, your friends have seen my face.
So it looks like
you won't die alone today.
Hey!
- The other day, you came by the shop, huh?
- Yes!
What the hell?
I was sniffing around.
Why did you take off your mask?
Now you've been made.
Just shut up and call Peter.
- Where are you coming from?
- Sri Lanka.
It's about time you did something
about this minister.
Immigration control reform, BICORE...
That's why we were elected.
Yeah, just cut the shit.
It's obvious.
When the government starts
to privatize the prisons,
you make money, I make money.
Well, we are called conservatives
for a reason, you know.
That's just the beginning.
I wouldn't have had my face on this
if I had an otherwise...
Sorry, I got to take this.
What is so fucking urgent?
We just found out Rajan is here.
You sure that's him?
Yeah. We need to knock him off.
Right, do it.
Suruli, kill him.
Make sure our traces aren't left behind.
What?
You idiot.
They all see my face, if they
tell Sivadoss, then we're done.
The rest of these assholes
have seen Suruli's face.
He says they got to go too.
How the fuck did they see his face?
He took off the mask, like I said,
he's a bit of a loose cannon.
Right, do it.
But I want Rajan done the same way
as they did my nephew.
Right, I want him cut
into a thousand fucking pieces.
Go!
Sir!
This is an act of cruelty.
They killed Rajan the same way
we killed Mathew.
It hasn't happened in many years.
How did it happen now?
Like we thought, it's not a white rat.
It's a Tamil rat.
So this is Peter's Rat?
Are you mocking me?
Not at all, sir.
I'm your biggest fan.
I just had a fanboy moment.
- Bloody!
- I swear on my mother!
I mean it, sir.
You and your men are legendary.
All your activities are
textbook references
for any upcoming terrorist organization...
Save me, Mom.
Call us revolutionists, not terrorists!
It's been a habit to brand revolutionists
as terrorists in this world.
Do you know the issue
between Peter and us...
Sir!
Please don't start with
the Robin Hood stories like,
"We fight for those
who can't fight for themselves."
Enough of such statements, sir.
I'm just a common man from a small town,
selling parottas,
handling small petty disputes.
But then, they brought me here saying,
it's a small job that pays a lot.
That's why I came here.
So you would do anything for money?
Of course, sir. Anything and for anyone!
Oh, my god!
Where the hell are you from, anyway?
Your guts weigh more than you!
From a place like yours, where they make
state-of-the-art country bombs.
Alright, do you know
why I wanted you alive?
Alive?
Really?
Sir, please ask them
to untie this for a sec.
I swear I will not harm anyone.
- It's a humble request, sir.
- Untie him.
Come on, Dharani.
Do something useful for once.
Can you make it fast, buddy?
Who tried to kill me at the bar?
Hey!
Who pulled the trigger on me?
Hey! It's me, so what are you
gonna do about it?
You duffer.
Hey, hold him.
- Hold him.
- Please!
Hasn’t your leader asked to
bring me alive?
He would have killed me, sir.
Anyway, I'm curious to know
why you want me alive.
Didn’t you say you would
do anything for money?
I was just curious about
what special services
you provided Peter and his gang.
That sounds sarcastic.
You've got every right
to put me on the spot
'cause I brought you business losses,
killed one of your accomplices,
but this is just the beginning.
Your terrorist org...
My sincere apologies.
I've got a book full of your revolutionary
organization's little secrets.
I'm just giving away a slice a week
so that I get more money.
Do you think I'm bluffing?
The cycle shop,
owned by your friends, is one of
your fronts for smuggling gold.
Are you surprised?
I've got more information like this.
You may plan to kill me
right here right now,
but if any such
unfortunate incident happens,
I've ensured that all your information
reaches Peter, who will burn you to ashes.
So I would ask you to let me live for your
own good, can I bum a smoke now, please?
What should I do with you?
Isn’t he one of a kind?
Here, what should I do? You decide.
Peter is paying me
two hundred thousand a week.
Pay me three weeks' worth right away,
and I will leave this country
immediately, without even informing Peter.
I came here to work for a white guy,
but I will be more than happy
to work with you.
Don't ask me why.
As I said, I've always been
a big fan of yours.
Also, please ensure
I fly business class and not economy,
because it's a ten-hour flight back home.
Brother...
Are you seriously listening
to his demands?
Don't forget he took Rajan's life,
let's just kill him.
Let's face the consequences later.
You're gonna kill me?
Sir...
Let me be very honest about one thing.
Besides you, the rest of your gang
isn't worth a penny.
Within a short span of time,
if I could decode
your operations and infiltrate your team,
what does that mean?
You've got a bunch of jokers.
Dharani will drop his shield
at the sight of food!
Hey!
Stop! Let it go.
Drop it, that’s not a fake gun.
He has a point, doesn't he?
You guys think he is wrong?
You guys have let us down
in front of imbeciles.
Suruli, I didn't mean you.
I didn’t get offended, sir.
Let's just talk business.
Okay, let's say,
I agree to your demands.
You need to do something for me
before you leave.
What do you want?
Now you know how to play the role of rat,
I need you to be a wolf now.
A wolf that knows
the ins and outs of Peter's gang.
Help us from the inside for a while.
Till when?
Until Peter finds out and kills me?
No! Until I kill Peter.
Superb!
Superb!
This is what makes you the boss!
Being your fan, you just made me proud.
But what you're saying is crazy,
and it's gonna cost you more.
Why do you need so much money?
It's not like you can eat money, anyway.
It's always a statement from the rich.
Why don't you try giving us more money?
And we will decide
whether to spend it or eat it.
How much do you want?
How much?
Peter was my ticket to a life
here in London.
He promised to help me
open a parotta shop,
settle down, and start a family.
You want us to find you a bride?
I already have a girlfriend.
Apart from the agreed
six hundred thousand pounds,
I need a parotta shop
to be set up in a prime location.
Thank god you didn't
ask for Buckingham palace, eh?
I'm growing fond of you.
So, consider it done.
Done? Are you sure?
Hope this is an act of vengeance
only for Peter and not for me.
Peter is the only target here.
Look how life is! He would rather believe
a white-skin but doubt his own skin?
I trust you.
What are we gonna do?
The same old technique...
We will call him for a peace treaty
and shoot him to death.
So he left you alive as a peace offering?
I think Sivadoss is on his knees begging.
He ain't gonna be
runnin' the show for long.
I still think we should
hear his proposition.
He says you should take
the peace talk offer.
Why?
They will be very careful and vigilant
in their modes of operation.
So it's better to accept
the truce and play along.
We can strike at the right time.
So, now they are very careful.
They also know that we are following them,
so it's better to take
the peace talk offer now.
Sir, I've really worked hard
to convince Peter for this meeting.
I'm kind of scared,
and you are not meeting me in person,
instead you are just doing a face call.
Relax, it's for your own safety.
Listen.
The next step would be
to finalize a meeting place.
Make sure you're always part of their gang
and I'll let you know what our plan is.
The moment they find me suspicious,
I'll be dead.
I'm risking my life only for you.
When you were sniffing us out,
you were kind of brave,
but you're scared to do the same
on the other side.
Just stay put.
Nothing will go wrong, alright?
Hang up.
A clown vending machine
will be in the meeting hall.
We will be hiding the gun in that machine.
Both the gangs will thoroughly
frisk the place before meeting.
Your task is to frisk the machine
and give clearance.
That's fine, but how're you gonna
reach for the gun during the sit-down?
That's none of your business.
Only one guard is allowed
on each side during the meeting.
We hope that Peter picks you,
as you know Tamil.
You hope he picks me?
So, have you finalized
the location for my shop?
Oh Lord Siva Sambo!
The world is full of tricks
Only pleasure will last
Man is a machine
Our heart is a sacred place
And our thoughts are the angels
This is Peter.
Oh Lord Siva Sambo!
We all will stay put.
The world is full of tricks
Only pleasure will last
Man is a machine
Our heart is a sacred place...
This is Sivadoss. This is Suruli.
Let's do it when the time is right.
I think this is a big mistake.
I know that.
Doesn't matter if it's small or big.
All right, don't miss a single spot.
- Check thoroughly.
- Keep your eyes open.
Kitano, you wait here.
Velu, come with me.
Suruli, I think you should step in
for John.
See, I'm a good believer
in workplace diversity.
Feels very progressive.
Well, there you are, Mr. Peter.
Shiva.
Sivadoss.
I don't think they serve curry in here.
That's okay.
I'm used to your bacon, lettuce, tomato.
No, I only smoke Indian tobacco.
I forgot it.
Let's begin.
I just forgot my tobacco in the car,
he's going to get it.
Go.
Don't worry, it's just native tobacco.
You know, I had a cousin once.
He choked to death on that native tobacco.
Tragic story.
- I'm very sorry to hear that.
- Don't be.
Just one less fuck-up in our gene pool.
And you still think
your gene pool is superior?
That was a shot in the bullocks.
Didn't think you would
aim that low, Shiva.
Brother!
Would you prefer I aim higher, then?
Superb, brother!
Looks like fear brought out
the humorous side of him.
Brother!
Kill him, brother!
Dharani!
Don't look so surprised, Sivadoss.
You of all people should know
that the pound
is a whole lot sexier
than the rupee.
You're not in my league anymore.
Actually, you're not in any league.
Treason!
The root cause of our fallen race.
It's all about the pounds,
nothing personal.
Brother!
Stop, guys!
Brother!
Brother!
You have betrayed...
It's all done.
I'll let you live.
Brother!
Brother!
What happened?
It's all over, brother.
What happened? Where is Sivadoss Brother?
They killed him.
They keep betraying us, again and again.
He let me live out of pity.
We shouldn't spare that traitor.
You see this whole street?
Yours.
'Cause you've earned it.
All shops?
All of it.
This...
is your little town.
Little...
Madurai!
Little Madurai!
They killed him without remorse.
Here's to Little Madurai.
Little Madurai!
Cheers, mate!
Cheers!
- Mother, do the honors.
- You do it, dear.
Murugesan, you're appointed as manager.
Run, mate, run. Keep her fit.
Sure, mate.
Looks like the kid has gotten
acquainted with my mom.
So everything is
falling into place, right?
Okay, let me get straight to the point.
When shall we get married?
- Suruli...
- Yes.
I like you.
After my husband's death...
I didn't think I would fall for anyone
until recently.
But...
Marriage? I don't know yet.
I mean, who are you, really?
Where are you from?
What were you doing back home?
So, you wanna know about me?
My grandfather hailed
from a village near Madurai.
At the age of fifteen,
he got engaged to Vadivalagi...
That's enough.
I said, let's date for some time.
Let's date for some time.
Date? What date?
Should I explain everything?
Next Sunday, take me out on a date.
Take me out on a date.
Date!
Hail BICORE! It's critical for the future
of our children, our jobs,
and our country.
But BICORE is also a step
in the right direction,
to keep those who would do us harm
out of this country.
ANNAMALAI GROCERY STORE
- Pose for the picture, bro.
- Oh, a photo?
That's nice.
BICORE is not the answer.
BICORE is a smack in the face
to the people
that made this country great.
And you know that several members
of the Tory Party front bench
have personal financial interests
in the companies
waiting to take up the private contracts.
You brought me sunshine
When I only saw rain!
- Mr. Murugesan!
- Yes?
Why are all the doors open?
Don't worry, CCTVs are everywhere,
watching us.
Only things that aren't surveyed
by those cameras get lost here.
Why are you doing the dishes?
I've made you the manager now.
It has become an inevitable habit to me.
It's a wonderful feeling.
These plates have stories to tell.
English plate,
American plate, Russian plate,
they all talk to me.
Brother, are you drunk?
I'm just speaking my mind.
For the past eighteen years,
I'd nobody to talk to.
In pursuit of a normal life,
I've traveled around this crazy planet,
washing dishes for almost
18 years now, and that's when
these dirty plates started talking to me.
I'm sure they'll talk to you.
Let's leave.
- Suruli...
- Yes?
We own nothing in this world.
My dear friend from Arabia,
made his way to London
after several years of struggle,
but now, all his life is lost
for not having a piece of paper.
Only those things are prone to get lost.
Paper? What do you mean by paper?
Yes, just a piece of paper.
The so-called paper
is the only proof of identity
on who we are, where we are from,
and what we do.
These papers are the sole reason
for the struggles of millions of people.
I don't have any papers on me.
I will be crushed and thrown away soon,
just like a piece of paper.
I'll become stateless.
Do you know how painful it is
to be called stateless?
What are you talking about?
Aren't you a Tamilian from Ceylon?
And also, doesn't Tamilian mean
you're an Indian?
Ceylon Tamilian...
I've forgotten both Ceylon and it's Tamil.
Forty years ago,
I was a Tamilian in Ceylon.
But in Tamilnadu, I was called a refugee.
A refugee?
I don't get it, brother.
After all these years,
even we don't get it.
Leave it, this is nothing
but a bigger political game.
I hope I will definitely
have a place in this world.
Brother.
Until then, that hope will keep me going.
I'm sure you'll find your place.
Suruli.
You should earn a piece of land
and a family.
That's the most important thing in life.
Your girlfriend Attilla
heard you're going to get married.
Don't make her wait for long.
That's the plan, but...
she wants to date for a while.
Tomorrow I'm taking her out.
Honestly, I'm scared.
- Suruli...
- Yeah?
The first date is a beautiful experience.
So don't think too much.
Just be yourself and enjoy the moment.
Brother, that's very encouraging.
I guess I'm ready now.
Are you blushing?
That's cute.
I don't know why, but...
I'm a bit nervous.
Hey.
Don't worry, I won't try to kiss you.
Let's save it for now.
But still, I want to enjoy this moment.
I just want to be in your presence
for a bit more time.
You look way too nervous.
Is everything all right?
Should we call it a day?
No, I'm fine.
I like you a lot.
I love you.
Oh, god!
You're hurt, Suruli.
I'm all right.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
Stay put, it's just a friendly clash.
I'll be back.
Let the game begin!
My dear Dharani!
Face me like a man!
There were three, no, four, actually.
Sir, Suruli.
Attilla.
He was planning to settle down here.
I'll change all the band-aids,
so you won't have to do that
until tomorrow.
I think you won't need me
till tomorrow, really.
Do you need me to go through
the medications again?
No, I got it.
Okay, lovely.
So I'm gonna go,
and make sure that he sleeps.
You know him quite well,
quite a lot, so whenever he wakes up...
A big dinner will probably make him
feel like a champion again,
so don't worry too much.
And other than that,
if you need anything, call me.
- See you tomorrow, bye.
- See you tomorrow.
Kid, chew the food.
See you tomorrow.
- Bye little one, next time.
- Bye.
Suruli...
Suruli...
Suruli...
Suruli...
Hey, have you gone mad?
Listen, Suruli. Open the door.
Before getting shot, I sensed something.
I can still see it.
I knew something was wrong
when I looked deep into your eyes.
- What's the problem, man?
- Open the door.
Hey... Hey, Suruli!
When I was drowning,
my only thought was that...
you shouldn’t be a part of it.
But it was you all along, right?
Hey, buddy!
Speak.
Speak up, you...
Hey, you...
Yes!
It was me all along,
and the plan was to kill you.
Suruli, open the door.
- Open the door.
- Hey!
Listen, Suruli. At least tell him, Ganesh.
Hey!
Whatever it is, we can sort it out.
Open the door, buddy.
I swear...
I'm crying for the first time in my life.
I had fallen for you.
I had plans for
the next hundred years with you.
So none of it was real, was it?
Even now...
You kissed and cried. But why?
You never loved me, did you?
If not, you would have been dead by now.
Then why?
Open the door, Suruli.
Open the door, Suruli.
What happened, Suruli?
Nothing.
- What happened, dear?
- Hey!
Take him out.
Mother, she was the one
who tried to kill me.
She tried again by injecting something.
If I was not awake,
I would have been dead by now.
My god!
Hey!
Hey!
Tell me why.
We deserve an answer.
- I deserve an answer!
- Dear!
Grandma, I'm hungry.
Your aunt has gone to get us food.
- I'll go bring Aunt back.
- Kid, stay put.
Kid, get back here.
Your dad's gonna be mad if you go out.
Kids? How could we even think
about having kids?
- Dheera, do you want to join us?
- No.
Whatever was said
in the news isn't promising.
India will support us.
They will send us ships.
We shouldn't lose hope.
We have no other option.
The supply van is here.
Let's get the goods.
Dheera...
Dheera...
Come here.
Get under it.
This will be safe.
Brother...
Brother...
Sister...
Dad...
Dad...
Brother...
- Brother!
- Dad!
Dad...
Dheera!
Dad...
Dad...
Daddy, Aunt saved me from the bombing.
Mother and Grandma are safe
inside the house.
Dad...
No, brother...
They are all dead.
My husband, where is he?
Where is my husband?
Don't look at him.
Is that him? Is that him?
- Yes, don't look at him.
- Dear!
Why should I live anymore?
Why should I live anymore?
Oh, my children
I'm your motherland
I protected you like an eyelid
But I'm broken to pieces
And I'm helpless now
I'm helpless now
Are you leaving me
Oh, my dear people?
My heart breaks seeing you cry
- Leave me, Dad.
- Come with me, my son.
- Leave me, Dad.
- Come with me, my son.
We must survive
to get back to our homeland.
We must survive.
We must survive.
- Mom...
- We must survive.
I'm a helpless
Mute spectator of your sufferings
Which land are you going to?
And how will you go?
How will you go?
Will the new land accept you?
Will the people treat you fairly?
Will you get a warm welcome
Or will they hate you?
Do you know him?
Do you know this man?
We should choose the right agency,
because lots of agents
send men to be slaves
and force women into prostitution.
Sivadoss, a trustworthy person in London,
will be able to give clear guidance.
I'm putting you under his team.
First, you will escape to Rameshwaram.
You will meet our local agent there,
who will guide you through the rest.
It sounds risky, but this is the only
option for a peaceful life ahead.
Everybody, get in line.
When will we meet again?
When will you come back to me?
Will I live long enough to see you back?
When will we meet again?
We got men at Chennai Airport,
so it will be easy to pass.
This passport will take you
to Moscow via Singapore.
You will meet a new agent there.
One more thing...
If you travel as siblings,
you may end up in trouble.
So, present yourself as husband and wife.
It may sound awkward,
but there's no other choice.
Hey, kid, come here.
You should call her Mom
from now on, let's see.
- Mom.
- See, it's that simple.
The monsoon rains are gone!
My land is now filled with bombs!
Oh, my children
I'm your motherland
I protected you like an eyelid
But I'm broken to pieces
And I'm helpless now
I'm helpless now
Are you leaving me
Oh, my dear people?
My heart breaks seeing you cry
I'm a helpless
Mute spectator of your sufferings
Which land are you going to?
And how will you go?
How will you go?
Will the new land accept you?
Will the people treat you fairly?
Will you get a warm welcome
Or will they hate you?
Or will they hate you?
Or will they hate you?
Share with them as well.
They must be hungry.
I think the agent is here.
You both wait here.
It's a special tourist train.
Once you reach Calais and board Eurostar,
you will reach London safely.
Okay.
There may be checking
in between, so blend in.
Okay.
One hour to Calais,
then we'll board the London train.
We can throw away the passports
and we will become London citizens.
London! Jolly good!
I'm sorry, Dad.
No worries.
Let me clean this up for you.
- Look after him.
- Okay.
- I'll be back.
- Okay.
- Sorry, Mom.
- No worries.
Oh, my children
I'm your motherland
I protected you like an eyelid
But I'm broken to pieces
And I'm helpless now
And I'm helpless now
Are you leaving me
Oh, my dear people?
My heart breaks seeing you cry
Passport, please.
Show me your passport.
- Where are you going?
- London.
- Who?
- London.
Come on!
Stand up!
Hurry!
- No, my passport.
- Give me that!
Where is Dad going?
He's going to meet his friends,
he'll join us soon.
Okay, Aunt. Sorry, Mom.
My family, my house, my country...
I left behind everything I ever knew.
After traveling eight months
and twenty-eight days,
I finally made it to the UK.
You felt uncomfortable
at all the frisking in the airport.
My brother...
for three years...
I've been searching for him.
I wasn't sure whether he is alive.
It was Sivadoss who kept my hopes alive.
Not just me, he gave hope
to many more immigrants like me.
Sivadoss was the only one
who saved many immigrants
from the clutches of gangs
who tried to exploit their situation.
He didn't stop with just
getting us inside the country,
but he also spent millions in getting
our legal status by running all our cases.
He got refugee statuses for many.
He has helped several people
who came to him.
All this came at a heavy price.
That's when he got into smuggling.
And that's how Peter became his nemesis.
Your India doesn't
welcome refugees legally.
Even though many countries like England
take in refugees,
we are still treated as uninvited guests.
A lot of people hate us as well.
Racists like Peter
want all the immigrants
out of the country.
Sivadoss was our only hope
against all of them.
He was our savior,
an undisputed leader,
and our godfather.
Peter and...
a soulless person like you
planned and killed him.
Sivadoss suspected
a Tamilian in Peter's gang.
He instructed us
to be alert about this rat.
I heard that Dharani sniffed you out,
and you were captured by Sivadoss.
I went the next day to ask about you
out of concern.
Looks like you have fallen for him.
Don't worry, we had straightened him up.
He's with us now.
I've given him an assignment.
He also said he wants to settle down
here with his own restaurant,
and he found a girl as well.
Isn't that you?
He wants a restaurant
in central London, is that fine for you?
Please stop mocking me, brother.
Don't worry, he's safe with us.
He looks like a decent guy.
You should also know
that border patrol seized
a boat coming from France with immigrants.
They were moved to
Peter's private detention center.
I'm using every measure to get them out,
and your brother is one of them.
We'll get him out soon.
So, don't worry.
That was our last conversation.
Treason!
The root cause of our fallen race.
After you killed Sivadoss,
the whole organization crumbled.
The immigration cases were suspended.
Hundreds of people in limbo
without a country.
My brother is stuck
in Peter's private detention center.
Lots of people were arrested
for petty reasons.
Some of them were deported.
After the death of our leader,
there's no stopping men like Peter now.
The reason behind this chaos is you.
But you are holding opening ceremonies
and having a feast, huh?
That's when we decided to kill you.
But...
when the time came,
I couldn't pull the trigger.
I still don't know why.
You will pay soon...
for your betrayal.
You will rot in hell.
What happened, Dheera?
- Mom...
- Hey, stop. Don't go there.
- Mom!
- What happened, Dheera?
Mom, a flight.
Don't worry, Dheera. It's not a bomber.
Shall we leave?
Attilla, I'm just a common man.
Just one of those guys
who want money to settle down in life.
They brought me here as a hired gun.
I came to earn pounds
and settle down in someplace.
I had no way of knowing any of this.
I just respond to what's in front of me.
The Sri Lankan War was just
another news clipping for me.
I neither understand
nor empathize with any of this.
It hurts only when it's personal.
It hurts now.
Tell me what to do.
Let me finish what I started.
You can't fix anything.
War can only be started.
It cannot be finished.
Let's go.
His name is Shadow Minister Andrews.
He's a proverbial left-wing thorn...
This is Minister Andrews and he's the one
opposing the BICORE law.
He's getting a rally organized
in Birmingham.
He will lead the rally
and give a public speech.
You're gonna sort him out
once and for all...
You will go to Birmingham and kill him.
Hey!
Suruli...
Suruli...
Yeah, continue.
The rally's on Friday,
but you and John will leave...
The rally's on Friday. You and John
need to be there on Wednesday.
You'll get paid on top of
what you've already been paid.
And he says...
Leave on Wednesday.
Kill him on Friday. Is that all?
Consider it done.
But I do have one request.
He says it's okay, but he has a request.
Go on.
I understand why you needed
Sivadoss out of the picture.
It was business.
You wanted to kill Sivadoss,
that's business.
It makes absolute sense
to eliminate your business nemesis.
I did the same back home.
Even he has done...
But what's the point of
making life harder for these immigrants?
They write your software,
they sing in your bars,
wash your dishes,
and clean your bathrooms.
They are washing your plates,
cleaning your...
Haven't they been through enough,
after losing everything?
They lost everything in war,
and come here as...
I got to know from Vicky that your country
and America are prime reasons for war.
You may have a million reasons
to destroy a country.
But you should at least be courteous
with the refugees, right?
Developed countries like the UK and the US
should be welcoming the refugees, right?
I've done a lot for you
since I've been here.
Will you ever think of sending me away?
Suruli is working for you so much.
Are you going to send him back too?
Enough of the bleeding heart stuff.
I'll forget why I like you.
What's the favor?
He's asking about your request.
Attilla, my fiance...
her brother is in
your private detention center.
He's not the only one, too.
You should be able to do something
and get them out.
He wants you to release Attilla's brother
and a few of his friends
from your private jail.
Okay.
Okay?
Really?
Done.
That's so generous.
You aren't as bad
as how people portray you.
Also there are a few more folks
who can't run their own cases.
Many people are finding it difficult
to run their cases for the refugee status...
Suruli, as long as you're here,
as long as I allow you to be here,
you and me,
we're like brothers.
You proved yourself, and I like that.
But don't get any ideas
about being a bloody hero.
You understand?
As long as you're here,
he will take care of all your needs.
But he will take care of only you.
So, don't try to pull Robin Hood stunts
and try to be a hero.
So he is saying he will
only release Attilla's brother, right?
Okay, that's all I want for now.
Let's deal with other issues later.
Goodbye.
Just one last thing...
I will never become a hero because...
I'm always the villain.
He says he's not a hero.
He's always a villain, just like you.
Thank you, sir. Take care.
Brother.
That shadow minister Peter wants you
to take out, that's my girlfriend's boss.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
Let's use her to take him out.
Oh no, Suruli.
We have cases back home where they get
life sentences for petty reasons.
If you get caught, you won't
see the light again, ever.
Ask your girlfriend to take
a vacation for ten days.
You better cool off with her
for a few days.
Oh no! Are you really
going to take him out?
This guy's face is
all over the news in every city.
Killing him will make you a terrorist.
I will do it for Peter.
I owe this to him.
I hope he'll back me up
if things go wrong.
Why are they packing?
Where are you going with the luggage?
Your mom insisted to go home.
She wants to go alone,
so I had to book her tickets.
She wants me to bring you home safely
when we're done here.
She's waiting to say goodbye to you.
Mother, what is this?
- I'm leaving.
- Why now?
They called you a thug,
a miscreant, and a murderer.
And everybody kept blaming me
for what you've become.
It's partly true as well.
Your father passed away
when you were too young.
I was a young widow back then.
Without anyone's help,
I struggled for our survival.
Meanwhile, you had grown up into a man.
I believed that no one would harm you
when I'm around.
That's why...
I've ignored all your wrongdoings.
You're everything to me.
That's how I lived till now.
Mother, where is this coming from?
Come inside and we can talk about it.
No, I won't.
I watched Attilla break
and I really couldn't take it.
I'm leaving, Suruli.
Being a thug or a murderer
depends on the situation.
But being called a traitor
is the lowest one can stoop.
You can die instead of
being called a traitor.
Get lost!
Mother.
Undo what you've done. Then, and only then
will we see each other again.
Let's go.
Mother.
Dharani, listen to this...
Isn't it funny that he went and asked
Peter to release the immigrants?
What do you think Peter is running?
A play school?
Like picking up a kid right after school.
Your humor just makes me...
want to kill you.
So, don't push me.
Suruli, the feeling is mutual.
Hasn't he done enough already?
Attilla, despite failing to kill him,
you decide to bring him here
as a savior for all of us?
Who does he think he is?
We know how to take care of our problems.
For now, just save yourself from us
and get the hell out of here.
As if he is a savior!
Suruli.
Please stop it, guys.
Stop it. No!
Suruli, stop it.
You can't clean up this mess.
You can't even protect your boss.
So, don't lecture me.
Yes, I know who I am.
I'm not any less than Sivadoss,
after all, I was the one
who took care of him.
I'm having this conversation for
the sake of Attilla, my mother,
and a pinch of guilt over my actions.
This doesn't mean that I'm weak.
We are clueless now.
You killed our leader, you traitor.
Sivadoss trusted you
against all our judgments.
I shouldn't have killed Sivadoss.
What I did was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Dharani.
I'm here for redemption.
So, tell me what needs to be done.
Unlike what you think, this is not
a gang war between Sivadoss and Peter.
Peter wants every immigrant behind bars,
but Sivadoss wants every one to be
liberated. That's what this war is about.
It's a war between ideologies.
Racists like Peter want every immigrant
to either be behind bars
or out of the country.
But...
we really don't understand
what plans he's got for you.
I'll take care of Peter's plans for me,
don't you worry about it.
Just let me know what needs to be done.
Legal status can be given to refugees
only by conducting cases.
Lots of refugees are
held captives secretly as well.
Sivadoss was sponsoring
all the immigrant cases before he died.
They've gone cold now, after his demise.
I've got money. How much?
For each person, to cross the country
and to get legal status,
it will cost you thousands of pounds.
We've got more than a hundred people,
and it's gonna cost millions.
Oh, my god!
Looks like freedom is pretty expensive!
Where's all the cash
you've been smuggling?
Sivadoss entrusted all the money
to two of his closest associates.
The two disappeared right after his fall.
Sounds like your boss was
a great judge of character!
Any idea which country
they might have fled to?
One is in America
and the other is in Australia.
They are really far away.
They have families?
The one in America has no family.
The other one's now the puppet
of the Sri Lankan government.
He's got a son studying in Tamilnadu.
Tamilnadu? Which part?
Near Coimbatore.
You got a photo of him?
It can be arranged.
Good. We'll have these cases open
in a couple of days.
But how?
If I can come this far
overseas and make my mark,
imagine what I can do in a place
that's very close to home.
Just leave that to me.
Give me your phone, I'm going to make
a long-distance call.
Suruli, from London?
Just send his photo.
Yeah, our Suruli. What does he want?
He's not enrolled at the city college.
What's next on the list?
Sir, an engineering college
near Erode, 3rd year.
We've found his house.
We'll wait outside till he comes here.
Dad, please get me out of here.
Please, just don't hurt him.
Just give me two days, you will
have everything, down to the last penny.
Thank you, brother. It all went well.
So, what's happening there?
Hey, Suruli.
We were able to resolve Anil's issue.
But, my niece ran away
with that guy from another caste.
My family is embarrassed.
We shouldn't spare him.
- He has insulted our superior gene pool.
- Relax, brother.
Once you cross the border, all white men
will see us as an inferior gene pool.
So it really doesn't matter
if you're superior in your own place.
We've a million things to worry about
in this world.
Suruli, that's very deep!
Are you all right?
You're costing me
by the second, now hang up.
So, what's next, buddy?
- Let's start our case immediately.
- Yeah, we can start immediately.
First, let's move the French board cases.
Suruli...
Thanks, Suruli.
It's just money and nothing more!
The cases have begun,
your brother will be out soon.
I mean, my brother-in-law.
It's good to see you smile.
This moment will stay with me forever.
I've made you cry.
But I'll do whatever it takes
to make you happy.
I love you.
You don't need to say it back.
I remember the last time I proposed.
I'm just pulling your leg!
Peter Sir. Welcome to my shop.
Vicky isn't around,
and no one else understands your English.
- Bro, can you translate?
- Yes.
That'll do.
Is this the way to eat it?
Seems a bit of a baklava!
Parotta?
Just mix and eat.
That's nice.
Spicy.
Thank you. So, what's up?
So...
how's Attilla these days?
Good? Happy?
Attilla, yes, she's happy.
Good. And your...
new buddy, Dheepan.
He happy?
What about...
What about Sivadoss' men?
They happy?
I could go on for-fucking-ever.
Indians? Bangladeshis? Syrians? Africans?
Is everyone freaking happy?
What did I tell you
about tryin' to be a hero?
Hey, take your hands off him.
Guys, relax. Don't interfere.
You see these streets?
They're mine.
You get your little brown world
on my say so.
You understand?
I'm not just your landlord.
I'm all your ridiculous gods with their
arms and legs rolled into one mad devil.
And if you try any more tricks on me,
I swear on your elephant-headed god,
I will chop you up and feed you
to your own disgusting customers.
Do you understand?
Yes? Or no?
Yes? Or no?
Yes.
Good.
Your parotta was very nice.
Here.
You leave for Birmingham, tomorrow.
Peter's a racist, supremacist,
nativist, xenophobe.
Which means?
Every country has two types of people.
Those who open their hearts to immigrants.
And those who would rather see them drown.
- Peter belongs to the second bunch.
- Then why did he support Suruli till now?
Suruli will be Peter's scapegoat.
He was setting up Suruli this whole time,
for something bigger than Sivadoss.
Peter's plan is to take out a minister who
supports immigrants, with an immigrant.
They will immediately brand
every immigrant a terrorist,
and BICORE passes without a hitch.
Once that happens, Peter's private
prison will be flooded with immigrants.
Each and every one of us will be
thrown out of this country.
They are taking this game
to the next level.
Suruli, what should we do now?
He wants to talk to him, please.
Old man!
What?
I was a lot like you back home.
I was territorial, possessive.
I hated outsiders.
So, what's the word for this?
Racist.
Yeah, racist.
But, after being treated
the same way here,
I realized I had it all wrong.
There isn't a country on this planet
that doesn't have immigrants.
Home isn't where you are born,
it's where you feel alive.
And I feel very alive here.
Which is why I'm gonna stay here.
I also know that I can't
survive against you.
I've earned Little Madurai as my reward
for taking out Sivadoss.
I've decided to use my shop
to live decently.
I will neither do your dirty work
nor do anything against you.
So, just allow me to part ways decently.
What he's saying is, he doesn't...
Are you going to Birmingham, yes or no?
So, we are back to square one.
My answer is no!
Let's go.
Look at this.
Su...
ru...
li...
Suruli!
Hello?
Tell him I'll give him one last chance.
Yes or no?
Peter.
What is it?
Yes or no?
How many times should I say it?
Get used to it.
No, that's my final answer.
Take a bigger scoop, kid.
Okay, hold it.
Oh, fuck me!
How'd he know you were here?
I assumed he had let me go.
But it looks like he's still following me.
Give Vicky a call, I'll alert Ram.
Put it on speaker.
How the hell was I supposed to know
that you overworked your employees?
Does anyone work late at the shop?
I'm sorry to say that
it appears your dishwasher
has snuffed it. My deepest condolences.
Was Murugesan still in the restaurant?
See, it didn't have
to be like this, Suruli.
All you had to fucking do
was what you are meant to do.
Now I'm gonna give you
an opportunity to redeem yourself
by accepting my offer.
Nobody else needs to die.
So...
Yes?
Or no?
No?
Well, stay away from the windows!
He's asking to stay away from windows...
Dheera...
Come here, come here.
The bullets can't get under the bed.
Didn't your daddy teach you this?
Yes.
Well, there's a good little brown man.
Now hurry up, we've wasted enough time.
There's a car waiting for you outside.
I want to pay my last respects
to Murugesan before I leave.
He needs to do
the last rites of Murugesan.
What? The dishwasher?
He has a name.
It's Murugesan.
Yeah, whatever.
Make the arrangements,
I'm not that cold-hearted.
But tell your boyfriend
to get in the fucking car.
There's a car outside...
They didn't try to rescue him,
and killed him in cold blood.
I hope I'll get a place in this world.
He finally has a piece of land
to call his own.
We must give him the best send-off.
Oh Lord!
The color of the festival of lights!
You left this dreadful world so soon
And that’s what really hurts me
Where you have gone
It’s the best place
The best place for good men like you
You couldn’t find the best place here
You couldn’t find the best place here
But still, you never cribbed
No matter what I say, don't react.
Keep dancing.
Understood?
Oh, sir!
Oh, sir!
Oh, sir!
Oh, sir!
Oh, my dear sir!
Oh, sir, you wanted
To travel around
And own a place in this world.
But I doubt even the six-feet-under
Is sufficient enough
For you to finally rest
Oh, sir, is it sufficient enough
For you to finally rest?
Oh, sir!
Oh, sir!
Oh, my dear sir!
Take this.
Come on, faster, guys.
Turn it around.
Why did Sivadoss Brother
stash weapons everywhere?
He hasn't lost hope
in the liberation of Tamil. That's why.
We still hope so. Let's go.
Oh, sir!
Only God is superior
Everyone else is his servants
Don't blame it on fate
Try to overcome it
Only God is superior
Everyone else is his servants
Don't blame it on fate
Try to overcome it
Hey, you mind playing Rajinikanth's song?
What?
Rajinikanth's song!
This isn't a fucking holiday drive.
Just play Rajinikanth'ssong,
I want to dance.
I want to dance.
What the fuck?
What?
Man yearns for land
And the land yearns for man
Man yearns for land
And the land yearns for man
It is the land that wins at last
He's on his way to Brum.
So we're right on schedule.
He's not gonna get cold feet, is he?
You just prepare your condolence speech.
Leave the rest to us lot.
Good, Peter.
We've got the chance of a lifetime here,
we can't afford to fuck this up.
Yeah, we won't.
One thing we know about the immigrants,
they know how to get things done.
Okay.
You're done. Go on, get out.
Peter.
Say anything to tip him off
and I will paint...
the road with your blood.
Translate, please.
I think he already understood.
Talk.
Everything all right?
Everything's fine.
We just pulled over to get some fuel.
Our Indian friend good?
He's alright.
Don't take your eyes off him.
He's a sneaky little punk.
Yeah, I won't.
Peter sound scared.
He has to be scared.
- How much further to Peter's house?
- Just ten minutes away.
- So, we don't need him anymore.
- No.
Dear John, say...
"I'm sorry, Murugesan Brother."
Say sorry to Murugesan Brother.
Don't push him, mate.
Sorry, Murugesan Brother.
Let's go.
- All set? Everything ready?
- Yes.
Peter's room is on the first floor.
At any given moment, he will have
at least twenty people around him.
We need to move swift and...
Our best bet is to take them by surprise.
Yeah?
What the fuck is going on?
What?
What planet are you on?
It's all over the bloody news.
The rally's been canceled.
Something about a security breach!
Security breach?
How the hell did that happen?
I don't know,
just tell your men to come back.
It's Peter.
John, get back here.
Fucking rally's been canceled.
On my way, boss.
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
I'm the evil face! Give me space!
You're a worthless prick!
Now bring on the race!
I will stomp you! Crush you to ash!
I'm the Blackie Jackie
Weapon of destruction!
Go away!
So don't ever try to stop me!
Oh, shit!
I'm unstoppable and uncontrollable
I can cause unrepairable damage
I'm filled with hate!
Concealed with a smile!
But I never hurt an innocent soul!
I'm the agent of chaos!
But, I'm also your redemption!
Holy fuck!
If you try to destroy the world
And divide people!
I'm there to stop you
And give justice!
Don't divide the people by their color!
Everyone is equal in this world!
If anyone tries to disturb this harmony!
I will raise my voice against them!
I will not allow
Innocent people to shed tears!
I'm always there to give them hope!
I'm the Blackie Jackie
Weapon of destruction!
So don't ever try to stop me!
Go, go, go!
Seal that door, stand your ground.
I've a plan for all my enemies!
I've written all their names
On the bullet!
So, you better change now
Before I pull the trigger!
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
Fire is approaching
Clear the way or die
Hey, Parama. Time for the light works.
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
I'm the evil face! Give me space!
You're a worthless prick!
Now bring on the race!
I will stomp you! Crush you to ash!
I'm the Blackie Jackie
Weapon of destruction!
So don't ever try to stop me!
Hello, old man!
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.
I'm coming for you.
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
Suruli.
- What?
- Are you sure?
No idea!
Holy cow!
A white rat, Peter.
Sometimes the rupee is sexier
than the pound, Peter.
Shoot him, Suruli.
He shouldn't go easy.
Dear Peter...
Have you ever tasted raw chili powder?
Say yes or no.
I'm not joking. I'm really angry.
I got a gun as well.
Say yes or no.
No!
This is it.
- BICORE!
- BICORE!
The BICORE proposal has been defeated.
Daddy is here.
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- My dear Dheera.
- Where have you been?
- Brother!
Hello, Peter.
You have reached your destination.
Where the fuck am I?
You're standing right in the middle
of the countries which...
your supremacists have torn apart
by the war for oil.
Iran.
Iraq
Syria
Afghanistan.
It's...
a long way to come
just to kill me, Suruli?
Not to kill. Something worse than that.
All the pride comes from
a piece of paper, like your passport.
I've destroyed all papers
that identify you as Peter.
Now, this is your identity,
Republic of Mattuthavani.
An immigrant from a country
that doesn't exist.
A refugee!
Live this life for a while.
Mr. Peter Sprott,
what's the purpose of your visit?
A man reduced to a few words
on a piece of paper.
What the hell!
We will meet if you survive.
You know this means
you're leaving me alive.
He's threatening us that he'll be back.
You better hope I like you
- as much as you think I like you!
- Let's go!
Okay!
Think that's the last of him we'll see?
What the hell am I going to do?
- He'll be back.
- For God's sake!
War can only be started.
It cannot be stopped.
- ...see me again, Suruli.
- Let's see.
You better hope, pal.
What the fuck do I do know?
Hey, big desert, he needs some water.
I'm not a fucking Syrian refugee!
- You go, give.
- Fuck that.
I'm Peter Sprott...
You may need some water.
Take care.
Thanks.
Let's move.
Cheers, mate!
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
I'm the evil face!
Give me space!
You're a worthless prick!
Now bring on the race!
I will stomp you! Crush you to ash!
I'm the Blackie Jackie
Weapon of destruction!
So don't ever try to stop me!
I'm unstoppable and uncontrollable
I can cause unrepairable damage
I'm filled with hate!
Concealed with a smile!
But I never hurt an innocent soul!
I'm the agent of chaos!
But, I'm also your redemption!
If you try to destroy the world
And divide people!
I'm there to stop you
And give justice!
Don't divide the people by their color!
Everyone is equal in this world!
If anyone tries to disturb this harmony!
I will raise my voice against them!
I will not allow innocent people
To shed tears!
I'm always there
To give them hope!
I'm the Blackie Jackie
Weapon of destruction!
So don't ever try to stop me!
I've a plan for all my enemies!
I've written all their names
In the bullet!
So, you better change now
Before I pull the trigger!
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
I'm the evil face!
Give me space!
You're a worthless prick!
Now bring on the race!
I will stomp you! Crush you to ash!
I'm the Blackie Jackie
Weapon of destruction!
So don't ever try to stop me!
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
I'm the king! I'm the boss!
