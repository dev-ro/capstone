            Tell me!            
     If you know what           
     the ending should be,      
     then just tell me.         
        It just has to          
        be surprising...        
 ANGELO: Don't say surprising   
 and inevitable.                
     But in this story,         
     what does that mean?       
     You've got her at          
     the top of a building.     
     She takes a step off.      
 You set up her belief in god.  
  Some belief in some god       
  she thinks will catch her,    
 and we hope it will catch her. 
    So should she not jump,     
      or should she jump        
      and be saved,             
    caught by something         
    or someone or should...     
  Just has to be surprising     
  and inevitable.               
  Surprising and inevitable.    
    -I'm sending it to you.     
    -Don't send it to me.       
         Un-send it!            
    You're trying to get me     
    to give you an ending,      
     -some perfect...           
     -I'm onto something.       
      You're absolutely         
      onto something.           
 But you want some archetypal   
 ending, whatever that is.      
 If you're doing some           
 "let him figure it out" thing, 
 spare me.                      
     Someone should go          
     into the "underworld"      
     -and drag up...            
     -And I need some help!     
    ...all the "archetypes"     
    and line them up            
    and shoot them.             
    Don't rag on                
    archetype construction.     
 You can't tell a real story    
 with any detail                
  if you're a slave to          
  some Joseph Campbell          
  one-size-fits-all mad lib     
  that applies to everybody     
  on the face of the Earth.     
      Are you feeling           
      that you're close         
     and you're wanting me      
     to validate the work       
     you've done so far,        
 -or are you feeling that...    
 -I'm feeling that I'm shit.    
    And I'm feeling             
    that you have the power     
 to make me slightly            
 less shitty, and you won't.    
      You are the least         
     shitty person I know.      
    So why do I feel like...    
    Because congratulations.

        just moved out.         
 Don't worry, it's only June.   
 It'll air out over the summer.

 gave this tour to the kid      
  who's going to be             
  your roommate in the fall.    
  You guys are so different.

  What are you majoring in?     
  -Writing.                     
  -He's working on writing.     
     What's he studying?        
     The roommate.              
      -Science, I think.        
      -Mmm.                     
     Zero sense of humor.       
 JACKIE: You'll have all summer 
 to get used to the idea.       
    I'm working on writing?     
 Yes, you're learning to write. 
 You're a writer who's writing  
 while he's learning to write.  
         -Two, please.          
         -Three.                
        -Sorry, three.          
        -Right this way.        
          Thank you.            
      -Jesus!                   
      -You asked me             
      to come to dinner.        
    You asked me to read it.    
     It's like a bloodbath.     
  A lot of it's punctuation.    
      -You got a letter.        
      -It's a style.            
 -Don't say Cormac McCarthy.    
 -Cormac McCarthy.              
     He made a huge impact,     
  but he wasn't sending out     
  work at your age.             
 Unless you have                
 a real idea about the ending,  
    it's time for me            
    to start sending it out.    
      You just said             
      you need an idea.         
 You just said it's not ready.  
     -I do need an idea.        
     -So?                       
      -So give me one.          
      -I don't have one.        
 If you do, you owe it to me,   
     because I don't think      
     you have any ideas         
  with your critical voice      
  constantly inside my head.    
        You guys fight          
        like my parents.        
 But they say that's what       
 keeps them hot for each other, 
    so I guess that's okay.     
    You've got six,             
    at least four years         
    of school ahead of you.     
     You're not supposed        
     to know how to...          
         I sent it out.         
     -No, you didn't.           
     -You sent what out?        
         Jump. My story,        
         I sent it out.         
    Where, to be rewritten?     
            -Mean.              
            -Sorry.             
 This could be a good story.    
 Way down the line it could,    
 but it needs...                
         -What, you?            
         -Mean.                 
      -Sorry.                   
      -Your dad's cute.

     have any siblings.         
     Half-sibling.              
     She's my half-sibling.     
     Where did you send it?     
    You haven't heard of it.    
  -Oh, god.

     I'm moving 85 steps        
     away from you.             
     That doesn't rate as

    I read it.                  
    I'm giving you my advice    
    as one adult to another.    
 Why are you getting so upset?  
 I thought we were both adults. 
 -We are, but it's different.   
 -Why?                          
 Because one adult came out     
 of the other adult's vagina!

  to get this thing out         
 past these first few waves.    
     You want to try it?        
      Hello, my name            
      is Jackie Durning.        
     Would you do me            
     the tremendous favor       
        of allowing me          
        to pay you money        
     to take my surfboard       
     and pull it                
 or push it out there just past 
 those first few waves?         
     Once you're out there,     
     I'll swim to you.          
  I'm an excellent swimmer.     
 I'll take the board from you   
     and you can come in        
     and resume...              
             What?              
        -Doing nothing?         
        -Pretty much.           
        -Will you do it?        
        -Okay.                  
      Right, here I go.         
         -Remember.             
         -Yes, yes.             
         I remember.            
 I know it sounds like hubris,  
 but once I get out there,      
  I really think I'm going      
  to be better than average     
 at intuiting how to do this.   
  Whoo, thank you very much.    
             Oh!                
            Darn it.

    -Yeah.                      
             What?              
             Help!

             Help!

            No! Ugh.

    No, you idiot, I'm fine!

             Ahh!

     Well, just to be safe,     
     show me you can            
     put your leash on          
 and get back on your board.    
             I can.             
        Great. Show me.

     It's possible I can't.     
    I didn't need any help.     
    I was fine.                 
        You're welcome.         
     Maybe this man could       
     give you a lesson.         
     I don't need a lesson.

 IAN: Here's the deal, Jackie.  
     We are going to put        
     this inanimate object      
     into an ever-changing      
     environment.               
          -Hey, you.            
          -Hey, you.            
     The surfboard does         
     nothing on its own.        
     It only moves              
     if this ever-changing      
     environment moves it,      
     or if you, who are         
     also ever changing,        
         make it move.          
      Do you understand?        
     Yes, obviously, I...       
     The ocean moves            
     over a sandy floor         
     that we cannot see.        
     When the shape             
     of that floor rises,       
      a wave is formed,         
     and that wave moves        
     towards the shore,         
     do you understand?         
        I'm not stupid.         
  If you can understand it,     
  obviously I...                
        That wave moving        
        toward the shore        
     will also move             
     anything in its path.      
     If you or the object       
     are in its way,            
 it will hit you.               
 Therefore, the safest place    
     you can be in              
     the water is where?        
  The safest place to be        
  given that you and the        
  object are ever-changing?     
    At home watching  20/20?    
     Can I have some water?     
     We're going to             
     paddle out to there.       
     When I tell you to,        
 you're going to paddle to      
 where the wave is breaking.    
     If you're lucky enough     
     to catch a wave,           
    you'll stand up,            
    placing your feet evenly    
     over the center line       
     of the surfboard           
      and ride that wave        
      toward shore.             
 If you're that lucky, well,    
 then lower yourself            
 back down onto the surfboard,  
      turn around and           
      paddle back to me.        
      Whatever happens,         
        you do as I say,        
        understand?             
  We can skip it and go back    
  if you're too freaked out.    
          Let's go.             
    IAN: The most dangerous     
    part of surfing             
      is entering and           
      exiting the water.        
    What happens if this        
    object comes between you    
    and an oncoming wave?       
             What?              
 What happens if this inanimate 
 object comes between you...    
      For god's sake...         
      (SCREAMS)                 
      Get on your board.        
         Oh, my god!            
      Tiring, isn't it?         
     Can we take a break?       
         We are inside.         
  -You know what that means?    
  -No.                          
 -We are in the impact zone.    
 -Oh, please.                   
     -Pardon?                   
     -Nothing. Go ahead.        
 If we stay here, we'll be hit  
 by every single wave           
 that comes in and get          
 tumbled in the white water.    
 So we're going to go outside,  
 or beyond the breaking wave.   
         See that one?          
     We're going to             
     paddle beyond that.        
         -I can't.              
         -You have to.          
          Says who?             
     Nobody's ever              
     asked me that before.      
         What is that?          
        Huh, freak set.         
     -What?

    than we've seen before.

     Do you have children?      
      What did you say?         
     -Do you have a child?      
     -Yes.                      
  Paddle as if your child's     
  life depends on it.

    seen an egg beater,         
 I want you to move your ass

  If you catch it, stand up,    
  bend your knees               
      and ride the wave         
      towards shore.            
        If you fall off,        
        cover your head         
        and fall flat.

     At the very least,

 -Why does he call you Jackie?  
 -Because he hates me.          
     It's not respectful.       
     He should call you         
     "Mom" or "Mama."

    they are clearly neither

    were doing that you         
    needed to step away.

            Nothing.

      It's not that             
      you stepped away.

 feeling that the one           
 stupid thing you were doing    
     isn't enough for you.      
          He would?             
 And what would you tell him,   
     if that's how              
     someone made him feel?     
 I'd tell him that that someone 
 would rather die               
 than sit still,                
    than be with one thing.

  and I wouldn't come back.

         -Hello?                
     -I'm dialing you.          
     -I'm dialing you too.      
 I would like to see you.       
 Can I make a time to see you?  
      If I told you             
      where to meet me,         
      would you come here?      
         (KEYPAD BEEPS)         
          He's here.            
            Gotcha.             
 Hey, I think we met before.    
 Ian.                           
         Right, hey.            
         How you doing?         
     Uh, is my mom here?        
      I think I saw her.        
         Is that her?           
      Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!         
          What's up?            
    The most dangerous part     
    of surfing is entering      
    and exiting the water.      
         Yes, it is.            
             It is.             
         Wow, Jackie.           
        Happy birthday.         
     Don't you have a job?      
         I was fired.           
  Turns out if you just stop    
  answering your phone...       
          So listen.            
     There's no way else        
     to say this.               
     There's no way you're      
     not going to hate it.      
     In fact, I don't think     
     there's any way you're     
        gonna do anything       
    other than scream at me     
    and forbid me               
    from doing it,              
        but I'm staying.        
        -Staying where?         
        -In Los Angeles.        
 There's no point in talking    
 about collective IQ.           
    There's no sport in it.     
      By the time you           
      drive to a museum         
     you've lost the will       
     to look at a painting,     
  so it's hardly a decision     
  based on culture,             
        but I'm staying.        
             Here.              
 I'm going to say something.    
      And I don't care          
      if you believe me,        
     because I'll prove it      
     to be true.                
  You don't have to see me.     
         I'll be here.          
    If I see you somewhere,     
    if I run into you,          
  I'll say hello and let you    
  go on your way.               
 You know I'd give everything   
 I might ever hope to have      
 to spend time with you,        
 but if you don't want that...  
          It's okay.            
     I just need nothing.       
     Do you mean                
     you need something,        
      or that you don't         
      need anything?            
    Being here is corrupting    
    your English, Jackie.       
        I need nothing.         
  The nothing that is here.     
        -So...                  
        -I'm going back.        
     I begged the school.       
     Blamed it on you,          
     which seemed to work.      
    They're taking me back.     
     I'm leaving tomorrow.      
          Good luck!            
 It's okay,                     
 you can say you'll miss me.    
     I'll miss you so much.     
  You know, I've pissed away    
  a good amount of              
  our money here.               
      Was your father           
      on board with this        
     crazy school thing         
     you're wanting to do?      
             He is.             
        What did he say?        
    Whatever makes me happy.    
     How does he do that?       
 I don't want to live to work.  
             Okay.              
        I will see you.         
        I'll be around.         
        You'll go there.        
         Life is long.          
             It is.             
     What was the idea for      
     the end of the story?      
        That she jumps.         
         And she falls.         
    And nothing catches her.    
    And she cracks              
    her head open and dies.     
        (LAUGHS LIGHTLY)        
 -Wow.                          
 -It might need a little work.  
     -Carry your board?         
     -Thank you, Angelo.        
     You got it, kidget.        
  Did you bring your board?
