Dirty pigs.
Expecting me to clear up this mess.
Heh. Fourteen dollars a week.
Poor devils. l don't suppose
they'll get up today too.
l don't know where to start in this place.
Oh, well, l suppose l'd better
get back to this. l'll get these cleaned up.
[CRACKlNG]
[DOORBELL BUZZlNG]
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
They're both asleep.
-They are?
-A nice-looking place this is, isn't it?
-Still a party?
-Till dawn.
They've made a madhouse of this apartment
since they were married.
Oh, but l have to know
about Philadelphia.
l'm going to see her.
l've got to know.
l've got know.
She told the reporters she was going on
with her career.
Shh.
Shh, shh.
You're the husband.
Guilty.
Do you realize that Madam Kovak is due
to play with the Philadelphia Symphony...
-...on Tuesday?
-Yes. The piano.
Mr. Van Allen,
your lawyer called three times.
-He wants to see you. lt's important.
-Thank you.
-He called yesterday.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l did.
-You did?
-You were saying something, sir?
-l am madam's manager.
She's due in Philadelphia, Tuesday.
House is sold out.
-l've got to know.
-Well, you sit right down here now.
l know little about madam's musical talent.
l just married the lady.
Oh, an artist like Madam Kovak
should be married in a cathedral.
A wedding of importance.
Everything she does is of importance.
lnstead of which she runs away
like a chorus girl.
Yeah. lt was all very impulsive,
wasn't it?
-Would you like a drink?
-No.
-Cigarette?
-No.
Morning paper? Maybe a sedative
to cool you off and quiet you down.
-No.
-Would you like a glass of milk?
Well, what do you want?
There's only one thing l want.
Madam Kovak.
l've got to see Madam Kovak
and l'm going to wait until l do.
Well, sleep tight.
The house is yours.
What's that--?
What's that peculiar smell around here?
Fresh air. l've just opened the window.
Oh, yes.
Skoal?
-Hello, Jock.
-Hello.
-How's the lawyer?
-How's the bridegroom?
Oh.
Not so good.
Say, you could've told a friend, who's your
lawyer, that you intended to marry Sandra.
-You looked on the wine, l take it.
-You may take it. l did.
You haven't been out in daylight
for a week.
Well, there's something
about that woman.
There must be.
She's a great pianist, a great beauty.
But after all, marriage is a step.
-lt's a leap.
-ln the dark.
Well, it's morning now.
JOCK: Seriously, Pete.
Are you going through with this?
-Well, we're married.
-That's just it.
-What?
-You're not.
-What do you mean we're not married?
-Sandra's divorce wasn't final.
Well, don't be silly. She gave that party
to celebrate her final divorce.
-You climaxed the party by getting married.
-That's what they told me when l woke up.
Look, Pete, her divorce decree
cannot be entered until next Tuesday.
-The lady got her dates mixed.
-You mean, we're not really married?
Not unless you do it again.
lf you wanna go through with this thing,
you'll have to marry her soberly and legally.
Oh.
lt will all be arranged very simply for you
to be married by a judge, if you want to.
Come out and have lunch
and we'll talk it over.
Oh, no.
No. Uh....
What l need is some nice,
clean fresh air.
l know where l can get it.
-You'd better pull yourself together, Pete.
-Don't worry. l will. Thanks very much.
So long, Pete.
Mr. Pete.
Violet, Violet.
What is it?
lt's Mr. Pete, flying down from the sky
like an angel of the Lord.
Hush your mouth.
Don't go calling that man's name.
He ain't coming here no more.
He's on his honeymoon, he is.
JEFFERSON:
How are you, Mr. Pete?
Hello, Jefferson.
-Been raining?
-Yes, sir. Been pouring down.
-Where's Miss Maggie?
-Violet's right in there.
She's the one that knows
about Miss Maggie's whereabouts.
Man, did you see that old airplane
come a-raring and a-snorting?
Man, l sure did.
[WHlSTLlNG]
[DOGS BARKlNG]
Hello, Violet.
No use using that whistle, Mr. Pete.
That sound belongs to the days
that is gone.
Where's Miss Maggie?
Mr. Pete, if you take my advice,
you'll get right back in that airplane...
...and fly away like a bird
right back where you come from.
l've just arrived and l wanna
see Miss Maggie. Where is she?
Mr. Pete, if you take my advice,
you'll get right back in that airplane and--
Now, nobody ain't gonna use
no force, Mr. Pete.
lf your conscience don't keep you
from going up, your good manners should.
Just think, Mr. Pete.
l have been thinking.
The whole of the morning.
We has had our thoughts too.
And they ain't been very good company.
MAGGlE:
Violet.
Yes, Miss Maggie.
Your name ain't Violet, Mr. Pete.
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
My goodness, honey child.
Lay down before you catch more cold.
ls he drinking?
What do you care if he's drinking
or if he ain't?
Tell him l'm busy and l've got a cold.
[SNEEZES]
-Are you taking your medicine?
-Yes.
l'm much better.
l don't wanna see him anyway.
That's what l told him
but l'll tell him again.
You go down and be nice
and polite now.
Tell him l've got a cold,
that l'm busy and that l....
l can't see him, can l?
No, Miss Maggie. You can't.
Well?
Why not?
Don't ask me the reason why not.
Just tell me the reason why.
She's got a bad cold, Miss Maggie has.
How did she catch it?
Walking in the rain alone.
Then coming home soaking wet
and sitting down thinking...
...and forgetting she's wet.
Thinking so hard about someone
or something.
Oh, l see.
We sees too, Mr. Pete.
We sees the papers.
lt's a fine thing when you read news
about your friends in the papers.
Well, l'm sorry.
Miss Maggie would never tell you,
not till Judgment Day, what you done to her.
But l knows and you knows, Mr. Pete,
there's only one thing to do now...
...and that's to go away
and stay away, Mr. Pete.
You get right back in that airplane
and fly away.
MAGGlE:
Pete.
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, you got a cold.
-Yes.
-What are you taking for it?
None of your business.
-Well, how did you get it?
-l got wet.
You didn't have sense enough
to come in out of the rain.
-lf l had any sense. lf l had any sense--
-l wouldn't be in your life.
No, you wouldn't.
Just like this cold,
a sneeze or two and you'd be gone.
Your nose is pink. Your eyes are red.
And violets are blue
and sugar is sweet and l wish you'd go.
l only asked you to come up...
...because l didn't want you to think
l was afraid to see you.
Like a little child hiding in her room.
Hey.
-What?
-Sit down.
Look at that. Without your shoes on.
-What are you doing here anyway?
-l wanna talk to you.
You wanna talk to me?
You act as if nothing had happened.
Well, among other things, l--
l'm thinking about going back
into aviation.
You know, there's a lot doing now.
Hemisphere defense and all that stuff.
-Whose idea is this?
-Yours.
Don't you remember?
The day after New Year's.
There was snow and we skated and--
Yeah, and l proposed.
And l refused.
Oh, Pete, let's not go into this
all over again.
You see, the unfortunate thing for me
is that--
And l'm not whining.
--it's been like this for four years.
On and off and off and on.
Well, there was only one thing
l ever asked you.
One thing l begged you to do.
To be a sober, solid citizen.
Well, sober anyway.
But l guess the prospect
was too dull for you.
Well, now it's all over...
...and l feel the way l did
when they took the bands off my teeth.
And l had those blasted things
for four years too.
Yeah, l know.
Tell me honestly,
is this marriage of yours going to help?
lf l thought it would, l'd be so for it.
Well, you know Sandra.
Yes, l do.
You like her?
l hate her.
Oh, not because you're married to her, Pete,
but you know.
Well, l won't talk about her.
The fact remains that whatever she was
or is...
...she is your wife
and l can't discuss her.
-Maggie, let me--
-Oh, Violet was right.
You shouldn't have come
and l shouldn't have seen you.
l wonder what you think of me, really.
You know what l think of you.
You think of me as you would
a nagging, haggling wife, and l'm not.
l'm young. l like to drink and dance
and go to parties...
...like other people do?
Every time l see you, l feel like
your little old gray-haired mother...
...with the roses over the door
and the lamp in the window.
Well, the lamp's out.
That's not true.
Anyway, l'm tired of being your....
Your haven.
-Did your wife know you came down here?
-No.
Don't you think it would've been nicer
if you'd told her?
Yes, but she was asleep.
Besides, l wanted some fresh air...
...and l wanted to talk to you
about something.
Aviation.
No, but....
Well, we all make blunders.
Have you come behind her back in the first
week to tell me that you've blundered?
-No.
-Then what did you come here to tell me?
Oh.
l don't know.
l'm sorry.
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
Come in.
Excuse me, Miss Maggie,
l just had to come up.
-Mr. Pete, you is bad for us around here.
-Violet.
Your lady wife must be waiting
for you now.
l'm sure your intentions are of the best,
but this is a personal matter.
There's nothing personal between Maggie
that ain't personal with me.
-Why, since she's that big, l've always--
-Violet, please.
Pete, you'd better go.
Perhaps l'd better.
l did tell you about that aviation thing,
didn't l?
-Yes. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
Sorry, Violet.
[VlOLET SOBBlNG]
MAGGlE:
Please, Violet. Stop, please.
[PlANO PLAYlNG
ON RECORDlNG]
-Are you still here?
-Yes.
Did you see her?
No, and l'm not leaving till l do.
She sent word
she would wait till you got back...
...and then talk it over with you.
lt's a crime.
Those are her new records out today.
The woman's a sensation.
And this concert waiting for her
with the Philadelphia Symphony.
How would you like a little drink?
Cigarette? Glass of milk?
No, l want Madam Kovak.
-Oh, that's where l came in.
SANDRA: No.
-What's that?
-Oh, that's been going on for a long time.
SANDRA:
No.
-What's the matter?
-You opened the window this morning...
...and l caught cold in my shoulder.
Do l get a kiss or don't l?
[WlNCES]
We've been talking
and he agrees with me.
That's nice.
SANDRA:
About going on with my work.
After all these years of working,
it'd be silly to give it up.
Of course, he's right.
My name is Peter Van Allen.
Oh, l'm so sorry, darling.
Oh!
Get out. You hurt.
Pardon, madam.
This is Worthington James.
Oscar.
Well, how do you do?
How do you do?
Oh, Petie, ring the bell.
l don't think l've ever had such a headache
in my life.
Pay that little man.
l think he's made it worse. Bertha.
[SPEAKS lN FRENCH]
Bertha, l want a cup of black coffee
with brandy in it.
Do you think that'd be best?
Would you like one?
-No, dear.
-No?
No.
Worthy James waited to meet you.
He's one of my oldest and best friends.
He gave me the money for my first real
piano lessons here in New York with Vannez.
How old was l then, Worthy?
Too young.
[LAUGHS]
How do you like my Pete
now that you've seen him?
Very good.
Go get a drink, Petie. You look sad.
You failed me. l expected you to come in
with something to say.
Something amusing.
He's a gay lad, really.
l'm sure of it.
Oh, Pete, go and tell poor old Joshua
l'll call him up in an hour.
l want to talk to you first.
Go along now.
WORTHY:
Well, l must be hopping.
SANDRA: Oh, don't hop yet, Worthy.
Stick around a bit.
-Would you like cheese or some port?
-No.
-What about Philadelphia?
-She'll call you in an hour.
-l guarantee it.
-Thanks. l'll be at home waiting.
-l'll show you out.
-No, don't bother.
[MUSlC STOPS]
-Goodbye, old man.
-Goodbye.
SANDRA:
Bertha.
Come here.
Take this tray away.
l hate the smell of food.
-Don't look like that. Are you angry?
-No.
Worthy James has been like a father
to me.
Oh, why, l haven't a jealous emotion
in me.
l could take that two ways.
Where were you today?
You didn't even call.
Oh, l went down to see my good lawyer,
Jock...
...then l flew down to Maryland.
-Whatever for?
-Fresh air.
-Did you get it?
-What?
The air.
Well, what would you like to do?
Do you feel like kissing me?
Oh, Pete.
You've got to be patient with me, Pete.
l've been a bachelor so long.
So have you, for that matter.
l should have been a dutiful wife...
...and whipped up a little home dinner
for you today.
You know, one of the most attractive things
about you to me...
...has always been
that you understood women.
Now, you're going to try
and understand me, aren't you?
l wonder if you could ease up
on this party life of yours.
You know,
come away someplace quietly.
Some golf and some walks
and some fresh air.
Golf? Walks? Me?
Pete, this is a side of you
l've never seen.
By the way, l haven't told you.
We'll have to do it again.
-What?
-Get married.
-Are you kidding?
-No.
l'll have to propose
and you'll have to say yes...
...and then we can be married again.
That's what Jock wanted
to see me about today.
But l don't see what was wrong.
Well, it seems your divorce from Mr. Stokes
will not be final until next Tuesday.
Ridiculous.
lt was final when l married you.
l'm afraid you're mistaken.
The decree can't be entered
until next Tuesday.
-You had your dates mixed.
-Dates bore me.
Then we're not actually married.
That's it.
Did you tell someone in Maryland all this?
She must have been very amused.
And if there's one thing l adore,
it's being laughed at. And by a woman.
Of course l haven't told anyone.
Well, are you gonna propose
to me again?
l think we should sit down
and talk this thing out...
...and see where we're going.
Then we can be married next Tuesday.
-l'll be playing in Philadelphia.
-Put it off.
ls there a doubt in your mind
that we could make a go of this?
Well, l'm asking you to marry me.
You were much more amusing
the first time.
l'm sober now.
Well, suppose you go out
and get yourself into another mood?
All right.
Pete.
When are you coming back?
-Next Tuesday.
-l'll be in Philadelphia.
That's the day we're going to be married.
l have asked you to marry me
on Tuesday.
l've already told you l won't be here.
Then don't go to Philadelphia.
[PlANO PLAYlNG]
-ls that Miss Kovak's room?
-ln there, ma'am.
[AUDlENCE APPLAUDlNG]
MAN 1 :
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.
Bravo.
-Here you are.
-lt's so warm.
l'll get your wrap.
You were magnificent.
MAN 2:
Bravo. Bravo.
-Hello. How are you?
PlNE: Oh, darling, you were never better.
-Darling.
SANDRA: How are you?
Let's have some food.
l've never known you
when you played so magnificently.
Sweet of you to come. l'd have come to you,
but l'm catching the New York plane.
What happened to that young man
you ran away with?
-What? Oh, hello. Come in.
-Oh, hello.
He's still running.
l've only paused for breath.
lf that's Peter Van Allen l know,
don't let him get out of your sight.
You might have let us know.
We were in New York.
Well, l'm afraid that party was a little wild,
even for you and Harry.
Excuse me just a moment.
-Hello, Maggie.
-Hello.
-Weren't you out front at all?
-No, l just got in at 1 0:1 5.
Oh, and you came right back to see me.
How sweet.
Where's Pete?
-ln New York.
-Oh.
Did you come to see him?
l came to see you both.
l thought he'd be here, naturally.
How did you know l was playing here?
-Called your apartment in New York.
-Was Pete there?
No, there wasn't any answer
so l talked to the porter downstairs.
Oh.
-You see, l was calling from Washington.
-Oh.
Well, would you like me
to give a message to Pete for you?
Yes.
Let's go into my dressing room
for a moment.
Sit down, Maggie.
-Cigarette?
-No, thank you. l've just had one.
Sweating like a stoker.
Well, don't catch cold. l'm just over one.
-May l bring you anything?
MAGGlE: No, thank you.
Pete left the window open while l was
in bed and l caught cold in my shoulder.
l didn't play very well tonight.
l'm sure he did it on purpose.
One thing, there's never a dull moment
with Pete.
Tell me, did you find him stubborn?
When?
Well, you were engaged to him twice,
weren't you?
Yes.
You're looking very well
under the circumstances.
What circumstances?
You said you had a cold.
Oh, yes, but l said l was over it.
The cold?
Definitely.
Good for you.
Now, what is it you want me
to tell Pete?
lt's an idea l've had for him
for a long time.
lf you write it, l promise not to open the
letter if you mark it ''Personal from Maggie.''
l went to Washington
to see my Uncle Ted.
After Pete told me he was going
to offer himself to the government.
What for? lncome tax?
Aviation.
Didn't he tell you his plans?
Not about flying for the government, no.
No, l'm going to keep Pete
on the ground.
What is this scheme?
Pete is an expert at maps
and navigation.
He was made a Fellow of the Royal
Geographical Society in England.
Oh, he has a natural instinct for it.
And that coupled with his flying...
...makes him the kind of man
the government's gonna need.
Uncle Ted said all he'd have to do would be
to apply for a job.
Well, that's very kind of you, Maggie.
But l like Pete where he is and as he is.
Well, he's your husband.
Yes, he is.
Supposing you go.
l came....
-lt was just a thought.
-Oh, and a very sweet one.
lf l didn't think you meant so well,
l'd feel like slapping your face.
On that one point, Sandra,
we deeply understand each other.
-Don't miss your little train, Maggie.
-l won't.
l want to make a party-to-party call.
What?
Person-to-person call then.
Mr. Peter Van Allen.
V-A-N A-L-L-E-N. ln New York.
Gramercy, 550264.
lf he's not there, try the Racquet Club.
lf he's not there, try the Yale Club.
Find him.
His wife, Mrs. Van Allen, is calling.
Hurry it up.
-Jefferson, whose car is that?
-Mr. Pete's.
-When did he come?
-This morning.
Why didn't you tell me?
Violet promised me she'd sweep him
out of the house with the trash...
...while l was getting you
from the station.
But why didn't you tell me?
Well, we wasn't gonna say anything
if Violet done got him cleared out.
You done had all the botheration
you can stand.
l heard a roar like thunder and in come
this machine a-flying through the gate.
lt done tore down part of the gate.
Slammed on the brakes and might've
thrown itself through the window.
VlOLET: Miss Maggie.
-Yes?
We tried every means at our disposal...
...outside of witchcraft,
to get him out of the house.
But he wasn't in no moving mood.
MAGGlE: l do think you have your nerve.
-Now, hold your horses.
l will not. This isn't a roadhouse...
...that you can drop in and out of.
l don't want you here. Go to your wife.
-Don't be a fool.
-Don't touch me.
Let's not brawl.
At least listen to what l have to say.
Supposing you go.
A prisoner has a chance to speak
before he's sentenced.
-You sound like a book, a cheap one.
-l thought the line was a good simile for me.
All right, laugh.
Supposing l admit l haven't had
a particularly happy time lately.
lt's been a shock.
l did love you more than anything else
in the world and it does hurt.
Now, what could you say
that would alter that? What?
Do you suppose l'd come here
if l didn't have something to say?
-Definitely bearing on what you've just said.
-No, but what about your wife?
Sandra?
Well, Sandra was not properly divorced
from my predecessor, Mr. Stokes...
...when it was thought
that we were married.
The necessity
for a second marriage ceremony...
...was explained to me by my lawyer,
Jock Thompson, last Wednesday...
...when l came here to see you.
But you didn't tell me that.
l should liked to have told you,
but l had a clear duty ahead of me.
l returned and explained the situation
to Sandra.
l asked her to marry me
when her divorce papers were final.
That was yesterday, Tuesday.
But she preferred to go to Philadelphia
and perform on her piano.
So l waited in New York until midnight.
And then by every stroke
of my conscience, l was free.
So l came down here to tell you about it.
l've always told you everything
about myself, haven't l?
Give me a cigarette.
Oh.
l've got a funny feeling
in the pit of my stomach.
[LAUGHS]
This room is full of ghosts. l haven't been
in this part of the house in years.
Yes, you know, we're going to have to
do something about this room.
Violet...
...lunch.
Ham, cakes, honey and coffee.
VlOLET:
Jefferson.
-Jefferson. Jefferson.
JEFFERSON: Ho.
You go right out and get that peanut-fed
hickory-smoked, sweet Virginia ham.
JEFFERSON:
You ain't gonna feed that man, is you?
Listen, Jefferson.
l'd feed the devil himself...
...if he'd polish up the smile
on Miss Maggie's face like that.
Violet, you better practice ducking.
Ducking, what for?
When that high-toned New York lady
what he done married...
-...comes stomping here with that gun--
-Gun?
There's gonna be shooting here
and shooting there.
No dog's gonna be safe.
l ain't gonna
have nothing to do with it myself.
[LAUGHS]
l ain't worried now.
[SlNGlNG ''SLUMBER MY DARLlNG'']
[CHORUS SlNGlNG
''SLUMBER MY DARLlNG'']
Steady, Jefferson, here we go.
l'm steadying.
Nice music.
Yes.
Must be something very special
going on around here.
Oh, yes. Yes, a wedding.
-Oh, friends of yours?
-Mm-hm.
l've known them both for years.
Personally, l'm glad the suspense is over.
They've been messing about at
getting married ever since l can remember.
-Fools.
-Yes.
Was it a nice wedding?
The usual thing: ''Do you? l do.''
Kiss the bride. Have some cake.
-That's a good idea.
-What?
Kiss the bride.
Why do l love you?
Because l am so beautiful.
You know,
you are a funny-looking little thing.
-What?
-But l do like your face.
And that crooked little tooth
when you smile.
-And your hair.
-What's the matter with my hair?
That cowlick. You couldn't even fix it
for your wedding, could you?
Ouch!
l can hear your heart.
lt's beating so fast.
Don't be silly.
That's my watch.
lt's still beating.
Well, it's getting late.
l really should be on my way,
you know.
Dear. So should l.
l'm on my honeymoon.
So you are. Yes.
-Having a lovely time?
-Lovely, so far.
All right.
-Maggie.
-What?
You've shrunk.
Oh, l forgot.
Maggie Patterson,
are you still doing that?
-Well, they hurt.
-Well, then sit down.
Do you remember the first time
l met you?
Mm-hm. At a football game.
Yes, you had lost your shoes.
And you had to carry me out.
Yup. And when you clutched me
around the neck, l said:
''Pete, old boy, you're hooked.''
And Pete, old boy, you are.
[BO Y SlNGlNG
''SLUMBER MY DARLlNG'']
MAGGlE:
Pete.
Pete, no.
All right, l won't argue with you.
You can make the house white.
-The trees white, the dogs white.
-l'll paint you white if--
Darling, now listen. Mr. Talbot's waiting.
He's a very busy man.
l think we should start in this room
in here, don't you?
You know, Papa preferred this room
to his own study.
TALBOT:
Well, we can redo the ceiling.
That was his chair.
He even let the dogs sit here.
And lots of mint juleps if l remember.
-Oh, yes, nice big ones.
-He was a tough old gentleman, your father.
-Yes, he was.
-Yeah.
MAGGlE:
And l can be tough too.
-What about, for instance?
-About you.
-Oh, l don't believe--
MAGGlE: Oh, Pete, stop it.
Here's Violet.
[LAUGHlNG]
What's this, Violet?
A letter for Mrs. Van Allen.
l signed for it.
Washington.
Anything bad?
He has to go to Washington at once.
And you just married five days?
l'd just let that letter blow away
in the wind.
PETE: Violet.
-Yes, Mr. Pete?
-Take off the covers in the other room.
-Yes, sir.
-How about curtains?
-Curtains?
l think some nice bright chintz.
You know, brighten the whole room up.
Hey...
...that letter for me?
Oh, no. lt's for me, from Uncle Ted.
Oh.
-Venetian blinds?
-Huh?
-Venetian blinds?
-Oh, Venetian blinds?
Yeah. Well, why don't you just--?
You're an expert, you know?
You do the whole thing
and let me know tomorrow.
-All right.
-Thank you.
Hey.
Talbot's gonna take a look around
and bring some estimates tomorrow.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Oh, yes, there is.
-Anything in that letter?
-No.
-Let me see it.
-No, l won't let you.
You will let me see because
l'll get it anyway. Give me that.
All right.
l would have had to tell you anyway.
lt's from Washington
and they want you to leave at once.
Really? Let me see it.
Uncle Ted says, ''lf Peter is serious...
...l strongly advise that he lose no time
in coming here.''
Then he goes on to say that Aunt Ada
is in New York now and--
l have an idea. You fly to Washington.
And l'll go on to New York,
stay with Aunt Ada.
You see your man in Washington,
come to New York and we'll have a spree.
-What do you say?
-Why, that's great.
You were going to lie to me.
You were gonna hold out on me.
With those innocent little eyes of yours.
Darling, l know you must go,
but l hate it.
Now, now.
We made a bargain, didn't we?
Maggie, you smell of hay and horses
and sunshine.
Gee, what lovely kids
you're going to have.
Yes, hello. Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Yes, l understand.
Oh, operator, when the long-distance call
comes through for Mrs. Van Allen...
...she's in the Palm Lounge.
Mr. James.
Hey, Emile.
[SPEAKlNG lN FRENCH]
Where is Mrs. Van Allen?
Oh, Mrs. Van Allen? Oh, yes, madam.
She's there.
Say, where are you going, dear?
lt's Maggie. l must congratulate her.
Order me...
...a double.
Hello, Sandra.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Where is Pete?
Washington.
-So you did get him into the air.
-Yes.
Maggie, l'm giving you fair warning.
l'm going to get him back.
Pete's married to me now, Sandra.
There wasn't any flaw in that ceremony,
was there, Maggie?
You'd see to that, wouldn't you?
Do we have to go on with this?
l've canceled my Australian tour.
Really?
Maggie, l'm going to have a baby.
-Pete's?
-Yes.
But you wouldn't. You couldn't.
-You're wrong, Maggie. l can and l will.
MAN: Mrs. Van Allen, please.
-Yes.
MAN: Your long-distance call, ma'am.
Thank you.
Hello.
-Hello.
-Hello, darling.
l'm talking from your Uncle Ted's house.
Hello, darling. Hold on, will you?
l'll go upstairs.
No, there isn't time.
l said, l haven't time.
l'm leaving on a trip immediately.
-Well, yes, dear, l know it's a shock but--
-Well, l'm down in the bar.
l can't hear anything.
Let me go upstairs, will you? What?
You did? How long?
-Well, that's very quick, isn't it?
-lt was sheer luck.
You had the right hunch.
lf l'd been a day later, l'd have missed it.
Your Uncle Ted
will explain everything to you.
Yes, he wants you to come back here
with your Aunt Ada.
And stay here until l return.
Well, do you know for how long?
Oh, you don't? l see.
Tell him l'm with you.
Well....
Well, darling, goodbye
and take good care of yourself.
Goodbye, my darling.
There's a kiss. Did you hear it?
Well, send one back.
Aren't you pleased?
Oh, yes, of course l'm pleased.
Goodbye, Pete.
Goodbye.
Pete going away?
You're going to lose him, Maggie.
l'm going to get him back.
Time will take care of that.
l told you l'm going to have a child.
You're lying.
Time will take care of that.
Ask Mrs. Greenfield
if she will come into the study.
Yes, sir.
The senator said he would like to see you
in the study, ma'am.
-What for? Who's with him?
-Colonel Harriston.
Colonel Harriston.
l'd love to meet him, Aunt Ada.
You will, dear. We'll have him in to tea.
What is it?
Oh, how do you do, Colonel Harriston?
Mrs. Greenfield.
The plane's missing.
Peter Van Allen?
Oh, that poor girl.
-Maggie.
MAGGlE: Yes.
ADA: Come here, dear.
MAGGlE: Yes, Aunt Ada.
ADA:
Come into the study.
Hello, uncle.
This is Colonel Harriston.
-Not the Colonel Harriston?
-Mrs. Van Allen.
How do you do?
Maggie, we've had some news about Pete
and his party.
lt's not altogether hopeless but....
Colonel.
They've been missing for 24 hours
over the Brazilian jungle.
Brazilian jungle? Missing?
Yes. The terrain is a little difficult.
lt takes some time to get a searching party
and their planes back over there.
lt's very rough, and none of them
have been able to make a landing yet.
And the weather wasn't any too good.
They were on their way back.
Actually, they were due last night.
Of course, we don't know.
l wouldn't say
that it was hopeless but....
Did you say you had sent
a searching party out for him?
Yes. As far as we know,
the only point they could land...
...is 40 miles from where they last heard
from the plane.
The country's very thick
and it may take a little time.
Yes, l see.
But they're all experienced men.
Brady, who's with them, knows the country
as well as it's possible to know it.
l'm very sorry, Mrs. Van Allen.
Oh, thank you.
lt's not hopeless.
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
Mr. and Mrs. Latan...
...and Madam and Miss Rosinni
are in the drawing room.
Very well. l suppose this is still secret.
HARRlSTON:
Yes, l was going to point that out.
Oh, l understand.
Come, darling.
-Doesn't look very good, does it?
-No, it doesn't.
[BELL RlNGS]
VlOLET:
Jefferson.
You go up
and see what Miss Maggie wants.
l just can't stand to look at her face.
Who is that gentleman upstairs
with Miss Maggie?
That gentleman is from New York.
That's Mr. Pete's lawyer, that is.
lt's so hard to believe...
...so hard to understand.
l know, Maggie, but you've got to think
of yourself, some sleep, some food.
What for? There's nothing.
l really don't care.
There's nothing.
All these weeks he's been missing,
l've kept hearing him come over here...
...with that silly little plane...
...and his signal going,
brup, brup, brup.
-l really heard him this morning.
-What?
Of course it was only Jefferson
and his lawn mower.
There was no one else like him alive.
Do you remember
those ridiculous sketches...
...and that silly old whistle and...?
-But you know him very well, didn't you?
-Oh, yes. School, college, his lawyer.
l knew Pete.
-You've got to forgive me.
-Oh, of course, my dear.
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
MAGGlE:
Oh, yes.
Jefferson, um, Mr. Thompson will stay
for lunch.
-Yes, Miss Maggie.
-Will you have a drink?
lf you'll have one, it might be good.
-Bring Mr. Thompson a mint julep, will you?
-Yes.
And, Jefferson, don't you and Violet
go around looking like that.
Mr. Pete's just gone, that's all.
Yes'm, just gone.
Yes, Miss Maggie.
Nice people.
Oh, yes.
They both loved Pete very much.
Everyone did.
Oh, by the way, Sandra called me
at 4:00 this morning.
Somebody saw it in the early editions
and called her.
She's out of her mind.
ls she?
There is a satisfaction in knowing
when he went out...
-...he was doing something worthwhile.
-Oh, l know, l've thought of that.
l've thought of everything
that would make it easier.
-But, you see, l made him do it.
-He was a very happy man, Maggie.
He was very happy to go on that trip.
He called me from Washington
the day he left.
He called himself ''the big family man.''
He wanted children.
Yes, l know he did.
That would have been something,
wouldn't it?
What?
Something of his.
To live on.
-Yes.
-Oh, if l could only scream or something.
Maggie. Maggie.
Oh, l'm sorry.
Oh.
This....
This letter registered special
came from Sandra.
-For you?
-No, it's for Pete.
Oh, well, l'll send it back to her.
lt seems like a very long letter.
l think l'll go to New York with you.
l was going to suggest you didn't stay
down here alone.
Yes.
-Jock, let's leave right away.
-All right.
l'll hurry.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
[DOOR OPENS]
Miss Kovak?
She's not at home.
May l wait?
lt won't do any good.
Could l leave her a note?
Well, you may.
Have you a piece of paper and pencil?
Yes, miss.
Thank you.
Who was it, Bertha?
l must speak to you.
Were you lying when you told me you might
be going to have a child? Pete's child?
Does that matter now?
lf it's true, it does.
lt happens not to be true.
Then you were lying.
Yes.
Sandra, do you remember telling me
sarcastically in Philadelphia...
...if l wished to leave Pete a letter marked
''personal,'' he'd receive it unopened?
Here's a letter from you to Pete
marked ''personal.''
ln that you tell him you're going
to have a child, don't you?
Yes, yes, yes.
Sandra, be honest with yourself.
You only wanted that child...
...when you thought you could get
Pete back, didn't you?
Now he's dead.
l came here to ask you for that child.
-What?
-l was married to Pete.
l could give him Pete's name.
l could give him everything that Pete
could have given him, had he lived.
Sandra, why shouldn't you hate me?
lt's the same old story, isn't it?
We both loved the same man.
So you admit that, do you?
Of course l must admit it.
l do believe there's one true thing
about you, Sandra.
And that's your feeling for Pete.
You know, l can't think of him as gone.
How he loved life.
He left us two things in this world.
l have his money,
you might have his child.
You're extravagant, you're a woman
of the world, a public figure.
Your piano, your success,
they won't go on forever.
None of us gets younger.
Let me ensure your future
and you ensure mine.
-Your future?
-His child.
That could be my future.
And l'd make you secure
financially always.
-Money.
-Yes.
That's so completely mad.
Oh, think, Sandra.
Oh, no, l couldn't do it now.
lt's different.
l'd be alone. l'd be afraid.
But you needn't be.
l won't leave you for an instant.
You?
Sandra...
-...let's call a truce.
-A what?
A truce until it's over.
-You haven't told anyone else?
-Of course not.
We'll go away secretly.
You say no one knows,
no one else will know.
Don't worry about anything.
Leave the arrangements,
everything to me.
[PlANO MUSlC PLAYS
ON RECORD PLAYER]
Hello.
Oh, l'll do that.
Here's the latest issue of Fashion.
The smell of cooking is making me sick.
Boiled vegetables.
And chicken.
You can't have steak every day.
[MUSlC STOPS]
There.
That's better.
You won't strain your eyes.
Oh, l brought you something.
-What is it?
-Open it and see.
Sadie?
Here's some more apples.
She's raising a rumpus
about the stew.
l know, but she can't have steak
every day.
l ordered them from New York.
Piano and orchestra.
Here, let me play them for you.
Whatever gave you the idea
that he's a pianist?
He's a fake.
Sorry. l guess l don't know much
about music.
Well, here are your things.
Cologne, talc, bath salts, lilac.
Couldn't get gardenia.
Vitamin B tablets.
What's in the big box?
Oh, things that we'll need later.
What things?
Stuff the doctor ordered.
Oh, l got you something else too.
You like color, Sandra, look.
lsn't that pretty?
Lovely. Suppose you wear it.
Did you bring my sleeping tablets?
-No.
-Forget them?
-No.
-Well, why?
Well, l asked the doctor.
-What did he say?
-He said no.
You couldn't have told him
how badly l was sleeping.
l told him how badly l was.
lt amounted to the same thing.
l don't ask you sit up nights with me.
Oh, l know you don't.
l have to keep my eyes on you.
Hey, how many?
My third since lunch.
Three, four, five, six, seven.
This pack holds 20.
All right, all right, all right.
l smoked 1 2 cigarettes since lunch.
lf you really wanna know,
l had six this morning.
-l knew that.
-Spying on me.
-l have to.
-Why?
Because you're such a liar.
-You smoke your head off.
-Oh, sure, but that's me.
l'm not special.
What do you want me to do,
sit here and go crazy?
Why don't you take a walk?
Oh, it's too cold.
Wear your fur coat.
That's a good idea.
l'll wear my new mink cape.
There might be a photographer
from Fashion...
...waiting to snap me
as l step over a cactus.
[WlNDOWS RATTLlNG]
[DOOR BANGlNG]
Sandra. Ham, onions, butter...
...everything the doctor said
you couldn't have.
What have you got behind your back?
Come on. Hand it over.
Pickles. Oh, Sandra.
Yes, pickles. l like them.
-l know you do.
-l want them.
l'm sick and tired of doing
without things l want.
You and that doctor with your crazy ideas
of what l can and what l can't eat.
You're starving me.
But you've kept very well on this diet.
You know you have.
And it's not for much longer.
And left alone, how you eat.
That's the way l'm made.
l'm not one of you anemic creatures...
...who can get nourishment
from a lettuce leaf.
l'm a musician. l'm an artist.
l have zest in appetite and l like food.
l've been lying awake thinking about food
and now l'm gonna have it--
Sandra, Sandra, sit down.
l'll make you a sandwich.
But no pickles.
No onions?
A very thin slice.
[WlND WHlSTLlNG]
Whoever heard of an ounce of brandy?
The doctor said, as long as you were used
to brandy, you could have an ounce a day.
But no more.
Come on, Sandra, play.
Just because you don't drink.
Oh, l do, l love a drink.
l haven't had any up here...
-...because you weren't allowed it.
-That's very kind of you.
l suppose you think
l'm a chronic alcoholic.
Oh, Sandra, l don't.
This will probably turn into a cyclone,
one of those tornadoes...
...you read about in the newspapers,
and blow us all away.
l wish it would.
[COUGHlNG]
Oh.
l'm stifling.
Well, let's....
Let's play over here.
Come on, Sandra.
We've got time for one more game.
The wind is driving me mad.
Can't you do something about that lamp?
lt's a pity you couldn't have found
a place with electric light.
Well, l could have.
l'd have also found newspaper reporters.
lf you want privacy,
you have to pay for it.
Why don't you tell me
l've smoked enough?
Well, if it will take your mind off
the weather....
That's right, be patient with me.
l'm a spoiled child, an imbecile,
to be humored.
Maggie, the martyr. You make me sick.
As for keeping my mind off weather,
who brought me here?
-Come on, Sandra. Let's play.
-You brought me here and l've had enough.
l'm fed up with the whole business.
l'm going to get out of here.
Sandra.
No, you can't keep me here
and l won't stay. l won't stay.
Don't go like this. lt's not good for you.
l'm going to the garage
and start that car and get out.
Be careful with that lamp,
you'll set the house on fire.
Oh, l will? That will be fine.
-That will settle everything.
-Sandra.
[SCREAMlNG]
You burned me. You burned me.
[SCREAMS]
No.
No.
Sandra, l'm sorry. Really, l am.
l'm sorry. Come on.
Maggie.
Maggie.
lsn't that doctor here yet?
He should be any minute.
Ed left an hour ago.
l never thought l'd be doing this
with some hick doctor taking care of me.
He's not a hick doctor.
Oh, no, he's a Park Avenue specialist.
That's why he's in Arizona
delivering babies at a nickel a bunch.
You know very well why. He could easily be
a Park Avenue specialist if he wanted to.
That's what he says.
Now, look, Sandra,
l know you're uncomfortable.
But don't worry about Dr. Ferguson.
l know about him,
that's why l took this place.
He's had a brilliant record
at Johns Hopkins.
Oh, l suppose he knows his job.
l wish he'd get here.
You smoke a lot, don't you?
Yes.
Sadie, don't leave her alone
for a minute.
-So you never had a child of your own, huh?
-No.
Mm. A pity.
Just the sort of woman
that should have them.
-Oh, well, you'll have plenty of time.
-l suppose so.
DOCTOR:
lt spells life with capital letters.
A woman without a child
is like a man without an arm.
The right arm.
Tragic, the father dying
before the child was born.
Did you know the father?
Yes.
What sort of man was he?
Oh, he was handsome and clever
and gay.
-Will you have some coffee?
-Yeah.
SADlE:
Doctor?
Do you know what l miss here tonight?
l miss the father standing around
getting in everybody's way.
Waiting for me to say:
''Well, old man, it's all over
and they're doing nicely.''
SADlE:
Doctor?
All right.
[BABY CRYlNG]
There he is, safe and sound.
Pete.
Oh, Pete, my darling.
[AUDlENCE APPLAUDlNG]
MAN:
Bravo.
Now, here, you see, is the river.
The Amazon.
-And down here is Manaos.
-Manaos.
The nearest point
which they could be brought.
Up here, this section here.
That's all jungle. lt's almost impassable.
But where were they heard of? Here?
Oh, l can't tell you that.
All l know is that the searching party
left Manaos yesterday by canoe.
They must have had something to go on.
Of course, it's just the vaguest chance.
What are you up to? Hello, Colonel
Harriston. l didn't now that you were here.
You're always whispering.
Want your coffee here?
-Come here, darling.
-What?
Harriston has come over to tell me
there's a faint chance...
...of at least two of those men being alive
down here in Brazil.
Do you mean Pete?
Well, they have rumors
of whites living with natives up here.
Miles away from anywhere.
-You mean Peter Van Allen?
-Possibly.
We don't know that.
There's a rescue party going in to see.
Then l must telephone to Maggie at once,
but l don't know where to get her.
Last l heard was a post card
months ago...
...from, l think, the Grand Canyon.
Something about Old Faithful.
l wouldn't say a word. Remember
the suspense when they were lost?
-l'll never forget it, nor Maggie's face.
-We don't want that.
After all, it's just a chance.
No, l think you're quite right.
l shan't say a word.
Oh, Ted. Do you realize it's months
since we've heard from that girl?
All the better. Save us some awkward
moments while we're waiting.
ADA: Yeah. You're not going, colonel.
-l'm afraid l must.
-l wanna follow this thing through.
ADA: Oh, well, l'm sorry.
Anyone would think
you hadn't been fed for a month.
Here, Mabel, greedy.
Give your sister a chance.
Now, that's all for today.
lt's Petie's feeding time, Miss Maggie.
We're coming.
Come on, Petie, going in to lunch.
Come on.
Come on.
There we go.
Pete, now we'll have a little lunch.
Yes, we will.
Now we're gonna have our lunch.
Come on. Come on, darling.
VlOLET: l got his lunch all ready for him.
-We know.
You know, l was thinking, Violet,
Mr. Pete went to college at Yale.
l suppose he'd like Young Pete
to go there too.
Yes, Miss Maggie.
Shall l go up and pack his things now...
...or would in the morning
be soon enough?
Oh, Violet.
He sure going to look mighty funny up
at that Yale college without any teeth.
l am silly.
Now you're talking sense.
Straining your eyes to appear
20 years ahead.
What you going to be doing
in the meantime?
Bringing up this young gent.
You is young, Miss Maggie,
and your little boy needs a pappy.
And you, Miss Maggie,
you ain't hardly had no marriage at all.
Nope. No other man for me.
You're the man of the family now,
aren't you, Pete?
-We mustn't spoil him, Violet.
-No, ma'am.
[CAR HORN HONKlNG]
What's that?
Oh, Pete, you're getting bigger
every single day.
lt looks like your Aunt Ada's automobile
coming through the gate.
Really?
Well, l didn't know she was coming.
-Here, you'd better take Pete and feed him.
-Yes'm.
-Aunt Ada will probably stay for lunch.
-Yes'm.
[PHONE RlNGlNG]
-Violet, there's the telephone. Answer it.
-Yes'm.
Violet will lay you down here.
l is a-coming, telephone.
MAGGlE:
Hello there.
What a surprise.
Where did you spring from?
Washington. l came like the wind.
How are you, Maggie?
MAGGlE:
Never felt better.
ADA: l want to talk to you.
MAGGlE: Come on in then.
[BABY CRYlNG]
-ls that your baby crying?
-Oh, yes. Violet's with him.
Darling, let me have your things.
Maggie, l hardly know how to begin.
-But you're trembling. What is it?
VlOLET: Miss Maggie.
-Miss Maggie.
MAGGlE: Yes, what's the matter?
You're wanted on the telephone.
lt's a telegram.
l just couldn't write it down.
You better go.
All right. Excuse me, Auntie.
Violet...
...l came down to be with her
when she got the news.
-lt is a telegram?
-Yes'm.
Just like the grave opened up and spoke.
[BABY CRYlNG]
Quiet, Young Pete.
Hello.
Yes?
Yes, this is Mrs. Van Allen.
Go ahead.
From where?
-Signed Pete?
-Ted was down in a place called Manaos--
Oh, but-- Darling. Shh, shh.
What? Go ahead.
Yes?
''Could not wait telephone connection.''
Yes.
''On my way''?
-Your uncle telephoned me this morning--
-Auntie Addy, please? Go ahead.
Yes?
''Arrive Cartersville.'' Yes.
''About midnight Thursday.''
''Love, Pete.''
Oh, thank you.
Arriving Cartersville
about midnight Thursday?
-Pete and another man were found.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-When did you first hear?
-About six weeks ago.
Harriston came to your uncle--
Arriving Cartersville
about midnight Thursday.
But that's today.
Darling, your father's coming home.
Yes, yes.
[AlRPLANE ENGlNE HUMMlNG]

That's Pete. That's his signal.

How far is it to the airport?
MAGGlE:
Oh, about 1 0 miles farther on.
ADA: What time is it, Parker?
PARKER: Eleven thirty-five, ma'am.
He's over here, this way, towards home.
He's gonna land at home like he used to.
Come on, Parker. Turn around.
He'll land,
and we won't be there to meet him.
-That can't be nobody else except Mr. Pete.
-lt sure can't. Listen to that engine.
You go right on
and call the airplane station...
...and tell Miss Maggie
to come right smack home.
You go right on and stand--
Be standing by.
-Maggie.
-Take it easy, Pete.
Mr. Pete, Mr. Pete.
The next thing l expects to hear
is the angel Gabriel blowing his horn.
Good evening, Violet, where are they?
Good evening.
They is at the airplane station.
They reckoned you was landing there.
Jefferson, he's telephoning.
Home.
This is your home, Mr. Pete.
This is where you belong.
[BABY CRYlNG]
Oh?
Hear that, Mr. Pete?
Hear that welcome for you?
-That's him, isn't it?
-Who else?
Well-- Well, l think l'll wait here
till his mother gets here.
Hey, you don't think he's having
any trouble, do you?
You think he's all right?
Well, l better go see.
Come on, Mr. Pete.
l knows what you want.
You want to get up
and say howdy to your pappy.
You ain't no poor, little orphan no more.
You has got a pappy
just like any other little boy.
Hold his little head.
There.
There he is, Mr. Pete.
The sweetest little lamb
that ever drew the breath of life.
-Where is he?
-He's upstairs.
Oh, Pete.
[BABY CRlES]
What about that?
Oh, yes.
What's his name?
We call him ''Young Pete.''
Do you like him?
He's lovely.
Darling, you look ill.
Oh, no. l'm all right. Really.
-Tell me, are you all right?
-Of course l'm all right.
Oh, Maggie...
...do you think l've changed?
Oh, the grey hair.
-A sober, solid citizen, remember?
-Yes.
Maggie...
...let me look at you
to see if you've changed.
Have l?
No.
Nothing was the same without you.
Nothing.
He's like me.
Young Pete, oh, yes.
How old is he?
Three months and four days exactly.
Our son.
Yes.
Our son.
He was all l had of you.
Except so often,
l had the feeling you were here.
Laughing at me and chasing me...
...and roaming around
in that silly little plane.
Yes, but, Maggie, l'm here now.
But you know what? lt still seems
like l'm seeing you through a mist.
Jungles and dark woods.
But, darling, you're here.
You've come home.
MAGGlE: Did she really wanna go up
and take that baby with her?
PETE: No, she wanted to hold
the plane on the ground.
Says it's bad for his ears.
MAGGlE: Don't you ever let me catch you
taking that baby up ever.
PETE:
No, ma'am. But ever is a long time.
lsn't it, Petie?
MAGGlE:
Topsy-turvy like you.
''Out with the boys.'' Now, really.
[MAGGlE LAUGHS]
Violet, you're spoiling the show.
There's only one show going on now,
and that's that baby going to his bed.
MAGGlE: Violet's right, Pete.
Do you know what time it is?
-Anyway, that's bad for his eyes, darling.
-The plane is bad for his ears.
Movies are bad for his eyes.
lt'll be tough on his feet.
-What?
-When he learns to walk.
Mr. Pete, can l trouble you
for this bundle?
Very good.
Sleep well.
Oh, would you like a nightcap
before you turn in?
-Now, kiss your mammy.
-Good night, darling.
-And wave bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.
Yeah, he's going with Violet.
Violet's gonna put him to bed.
You know, Maggie, nobody but you
could have such a lovely baby.
Oh, he'd be a perfect baby
no matter who his mother was.
Why can't we take him with us
to New York tomorrow?
Pete, you're insane.
But he'd like New York.
How do you know?
He told me he would.
You're absolutely mad.
HARRlSTON: He's a marvelous boy.
PETE: Oh, yeah.
You know, l have dozens of these.
lf you really enjoy looking at them...
...l could send you 50 to Washington
if you send them back.
-He'll send you 1 50 if you want.
BARTENDER: Your Coke, sir.
-Oh, thank you.
-Coke, my eye.
-That's a Cuba libre.
-Do you mind?
No, darling, we're on a spree.
But don't forget, l'm right here beside you.
-First time in New York since l got back.
-lt's a celebration.
[LAUGHlNG]
-Who is it?
-Guess.
l don't know.
Pete, darling.
What does one say to a ghost?
Hello, Maggie. l couldn't believe it
when l heard you were alive.
lt was in Australia before a concert.
l drank champagne...
...and played Chopin's ''Funeral March''
in swing time, actually.
-Have a drink?
-No, thanks.
-Colonel Harriston, Miss Kovak.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
-Staying in town long?
No, we're going home tomorrow.
-Running away so soon?
-We've been here a week.
-l do miss the country.
-That's what she says. Don't believe her.
She's just dying to get back to her boy.
She hates being away from him. Oh.
l've got something to show you.
-Here.
-Oh, pictures. Oh, l love them.
That's the son and heir.
What do you think of him?
Why, he's so big.
He's 31 inches tall, weighs 29 pounds,
has eight teeth and he bites.
And if you don't believe me,
just ask that puppy there.
Oh, he's lovely.
And here.
Here's one taken with his mother.
l think he looks like Maggie.
But she will have it that he looks like me.
He is like you.
-Oh, but he has Maggie's smile.
-Perhaps.
l don't know much about babies.
Well, l must go.
You're both looking so well.
That must have been quite a moment...
...when you told Pete about the baby.
l'd like to have been there.
Well, that's what l call a striking woman.
Mister and Missis--
Come on.
Here you go. Here.
Jefferson, take them.
JEFFERSON: Come on, Mister and Missis,
get your supper with the rest of them.
[PlANO PLAYlNG lN DlSTANCE]
Well, here l am.
Yes, l was expecting you.
-Going to ask me to stay?
-No.
-You'd better.
PETE: Maggie.
Maggie. Maggie.
SANDRA:
Pete.
-Why, Sandra.
-Hello, darling. How are you?
What are you doing here?
l hardly know myself.
l was motoring to White Sulphur Springs.
l realized
l'd gone through to Maryland...
...that you lived in Maryland,
and here l am.
l hope l'm not intruding.
Of course not.
Would you like some tea?
-l'd rather have a drink.
-Good.
-Gee, Sandra, you're looking fine.
SANDRA: l feel well. A little tired.
Oh, l love this place.
PETE:
Yes, l must show it to you.
l was wondering,
could you put me up for the night?
l was going to White Sulphur
for a rest anyway. l've had a tough season.
Why, yes, l suppose we could.
Couldn't we, Maggie?
Why, yes.
Oh, that would be lovely. Thanks.
How much ground have you got here?
PETE: Oh, about 20 acres. You see,
we're still sort of doing the house over.
Maggie used the other wing.
This part of the house used to be shut off.
l see. And when the family expanded,
the house went with it.
PETE: Mm-hm. That addition,
let me tell you, is something.
l can hardly wait to see it.
lt? lt's a him.
Oh, that's right. lt was a boy, wasn't it?
-What would you like to drink, Sandra?
-l don't know.
-Mint julep?
-Lovely.
-What are you drinking?
-The same.
Three mint juleps,
nice and cold and frosty.
Yes, sir, Mr. Pete.
l'm dying to see that baby.
-Could we go up now?
-Of course you can.
Pete, it's time for his bath.
-l know.
-Can't l see him in his bath?
Why, certainly. Come on.
lsn't the proud mama coming?
[VlOLET HUMMlNG]
Oh, here he is.
Oh, he's got company.
-Good evening, ma'am.
-Good evening.
Lady come to see you.
-Has he had his bath?
-Yes, ma'am.
Now take your little bow
the way Violet taught you.
He's kind of shy of strangers.
He's got to get over that now.
Let me have him, Violet.
-Go to your pappy.
-Come on now.
-There.
-Now, no more nonsense.
Now, go on bow for the lady.
There, that's it.
That's a good boy.
Now you go to your mother.
-What do you think of him?
-Oh, l like him.
[MUSlC PLAYS
ON RECORD PLAYER]
-What's that?
-He always likes his little tune...
...before he goes to sleep.
Oh, musical?
Where do l sleep?
ln the south room.
Jefferson will light the fire.
l'll show you.
Maggie likes to stay and tuck him in.
SANDRA:
Shall we have that drink first, Pete?
They's nice and frosty, Mr. Pete.
PETE:
Coming right down, Jefferson.
SANDRA: Pete.
-Hm?
Come on. Our drinks are waiting.
Hey, aren't you dressed yet?
Oh, are we dressing?
Well, l thought you'd want to.
We have a guest.
-What's the matter? You got a headache?
-No.
Well, then you better hurry.
lt's almost 7:00.
All right.
[CLOCK CHlMES]
SANDRA: Harriett won't leave New York,
even in the winter.
PETE: She was a good sort.
Didn't she lose money?
SANDRA: No, that's the story she tells.
Fuzzy left her a lot.
PETE: Did Fuzzy die?
SANDRA: No, he gave her a lot.
He's in a home for inebriates,
someplace in New Jersey.
PETE:
Oh. Hello, darling. You're late.
-We've already had three.
-Three?
Oh, Maggie, that wifely tone.
Do you count his cigarettes too?
lt's doctor's orders.
Doctor's orders.
How familiar that sounds.
Would you believe it?
l was under doctor's orders.
You?
Yes. l had to count my cigarettes,
my drinks and my calories.
l had a little dragon watching over me
every minute to see that l did it.
lt didn't seem to do you any harm.
No, l have never seen you look
more blooming.
-Come on. Have another one.
-Why, l shouldn't.
But how l love to do things l shouldn't.
To my hostess.
Maggie, my dear, may you always be
as happy as you are now.
Dinner's served.
You always were a traveler.
You would love Australia, Pete.
lt's a great man's country.
Earthy and exciting.
Reminds me of our own West.
You know, Arizona.
Arizona?
That's where Young Pete was born.
SANDRA: Oh, really?
PETE: Yeah.
-Not here in the ancestral home?
-No.
That's when l was missing.
Pretty grim for Maggie.
No wonder she wanted to get away
from people.
Mr. Pete, you're wanted
on the telephone. Long distance.
Oh, excuse me, ladies.
Jefferson, we'll have our coffee
in the drawing room.
Oh, l'll take my brandy with me.
MAGGlE:
Put the coffee there.
What are you going to do?
-What are you going to do?
-Nothing.
-You're going to hold me to my bargain?
-Yes.
When l made it,
l didn't know Pete was alive.
When you thought he was dead,
you didn't want that child.
Now he's alive, you want both.
lt was never a part of the bargain
that Pete should be alive.
The money you gave me is in trust.
lt's never been touched.
You're not going to tell Pete.
No, Maggie.
l'm not going to tell him.
You're going to tell him.
And l'm gonna stay here until you do.
[DOOR OPENS]
PETE:
Well, that's that.
Harriston has new planes
that he wants me to see.
l think l'm gonna say good night.
l won't have any coffee.
lt might keep me awake.
l want sleep.
-Sleep? You're not turning in now?
-Maggie looks a little tired.
Are you, Maggie? lt's so early.
l won't go to bed right away.
l'll read and write letters.
Open the windows
and get some of your good country air.
-You've got luncheon guests tomorrow.
-Yes.
Then l think you've had quite enough
for one evening.
-Good night and try and get some rest.
-Good night, Sandra.
Oh, don't bother, Maggie.
l can find my way.
MAGGlE:
Good night, Sandra.
Coffee?
What's going on between you two?
-Nothing.
-Well, something must have happened.
Did Sandra say anything to upset you?
No, she didn't.
Well, then, my darling,
don't you think you've let me down a little?
How?
Well, l don't know
why Sandra came here.
But l'm sure she came here
for some reason.
And l particularly wanted her to see
how happy we are.
We are happy, aren't we?
Of course.
Then, my darling, don't you think you could
have taken some other way of showing it?
You hardly ate. You hardly spoke.
Anyone would think that l beat you
in private.
l'm sorry.
Maggie, there's something between us
tonight.
l don't know what it is
but it's like flying in a fog.
l can't seem to get my bearings
and l don't like it.
We've always told each other everything,
haven't we?
That's been the great thing. No secrets.
Always honest with each other,
haven't we?
Well, then don't you think you can tell me
what's making you unhappy?
Maggie, l think l know what it is.
lt's Sandra. Her being here
is what upset you, hasn't it?
And you think that-- Well, that l still
find her attractive, don't you?
Do you?
l'd be lying to you if l said anything else.
Any man would find Sandra attractive.
Perhaps even a little exciting.
But you see, Maggie,
l'm not just any man now.
l'm your husband.
The father of Young Pete.
And believe me,
that makes a whale of a difference.
You and Young Pete.
You'd have to be a man
to know what that means.
But it's the tops.
What time is it, Violet?
l didn't get to sleep till early this morning.
lt's 1 0:00. l've laid your clothes out.
That wretched lunch.
What am l going to do?
The first thing you'll do is drink your coffee.
There ain't nobody coming for an hour.
And me and Jefferson done got everything
under control.
Well, give them their mint juleps
when they arrive.
And then smoked turkey
and Virginia ham...
...and then all the hot dishes
out on the buffet.
l don't want anything to go wrong,
Violet.
Oh, is Kovak up yet?
Her? Laws, yes.
She was up with the birds.
Had breakfast and then come
to the nursery and took the baby.
Where?
What's the matter with you this morning?
You're as white as the tablecloth.
She just took him for a little walk.
They is down on the lawn.
-He's not a bit afraid, is he?
-No. No.
You're not afraid, are you?
[SANDRA LAUGHS]
SANDRA:
All right.
SANDRA: Good morning, Maggie.
MAGGlE: Good morning.
Hello, sleepy head.
Hello.
l'm sorry l slept so late.
l'm getting dressed now.
Take your time. l'm getting acquainted
with this young man.
He's a darling.
Yes, isn't he?
l'm thinking of stealing him.
[LAUGHS]
You better not try it.
Here, Miss Maggie.
MAGGlE:
Pete.
-Pete.
-Maggie.
l've changed my mind since last night.
lf you think l'll stand by, let Pete think that
child is yours and say nothing, you're crazy.
Why didn't you tell him the truth
when he came back?
Why did you lie to him?
l didn't lie to him.
Pete thinks that child is yours.
He is.
-What?
-l didn't lie to Pete.
The child is mine.
Your part was finished
the minute you gave that baby to me.
From that day on,
l had only one purpose in my life...
...to make that baby mine
and to forget that you ever existed.
So you told Pete the baby was yours.
What did you think l'd do about that?
Oh, l don't know what l thought.
That you'd never come back.
That perhaps you'd marry
and stay away for years.
Perhaps you'd die.
l hoped you would.
But l didn't die and l haven't stayed away,
and l want that child.
Sandra, you walked away from
that baby without one backward look.
-l've seen him.
-You could have anytime. We made no rule.
l was in Australia.
lt takes more than an ocean to keep a
mother from a child she really wants to see.
All those months, you never
wrote me one line asking about him.
You were perfectly satisfied to have him
off your hands.
Why, if that had been my child,
l'd have never given him up.
But he's not your child
and you're going to give him up.
You could justify that lie to yourself,
but you can't justify it to Pete.
He'll never forgive you, Maggie.
Oh, you're not going to tell Pete,
are you?
You see, you're afraid. You don't dare
tell him how you've lied to him.
l'll tell you something else you're afraid of.
You're afraid you'll lose Pete. You will.
He never loved you as he loved me.
You were second choice.
You caught him on the rebound.
There's only one thing holding him
to you, Maggie, and that's my baby.
l'd be too proud to hold a man
with another woman's child.
Pete...
...come here.
-What's the matter?
-Sit down.
-l've got something to tell you.
-Oh, what?
l've lied to you about Young Pete.
What do you mean?
l mean, he isn't mine.
-What are you talking about?
-He belongs to Sandra.
Sandra's his mother.
He's mine, Pete.
Yours and mine.
l'll tell you as simply as l can.
When you were in South America
before you were missing...
...Sandra told me she was going
to have a child.
Your child.
And then when you didn't come back
and we thought you were dead...
...well, it wasn't an easy situation
for Sandra to face alone...
...so l went away with her and stayed
until Young Pete was born.
Then l persuaded her to let me take him.
lt was the only way he could have
the place in life he was entitled to.
He was your son.
So Sandra gave him up...
...so he could have that place.
Wait a minute.
Oh.
That's why you went to Arizona alone.
That's why you didn't take Violet
or Aunt Ada with you.
-Yes.
-Yes.
l thought there was something funny.
You were always so shy
about taking the credit for Young Pete.
And l remember you saying once:
''No matter who the mother is,
the baby would be perfect.''
Yeah.
At the time,
l thought that was rather sweet.
l liked it.
And you, Sandra.
Ever since you've been in this house...
...you've been hammering sarcastically
at Maggie about that baby.
The ''proud mother'' business.
l thought there was something.
-Pete, don't you see that--?
-Yeah.
You told everyone that the baby was yours.
You lied to everyone.
When l came back, you even lied to me.
How long did you intend to go on lying,
Maggie?
Well, l couldn't bear the thought
of losing either of you.
PETE:
Well, why are you telling me now?
Because now Sandra wants the baby.
-You're gonna take the baby away?
-He's mine, Pete.
When l gave him up,
l didn't know you were still alive.
-lt's different now.
-How is it different now?
Sandra just told me that l was only
holding you because of Young Pete.
Her child.
And that if you knew
l'd lied to you, you....
Well, you'd leave me.
Stop. Stop it.
[MAGGlE SOBBlNG]
-Haven't you any sense?
-Oh, but--
Shut up.
Don't act like a crybaby.
Well, Sandra...
...the baby is yours.
lf you want to take him...
...there isn't very much l can do about it.
He's a fine little chap...
...and we'll miss him, naturally.
Maggie...
...thank heaven we've got each other.
Oh, yes.
VlOLET: Here they is.
Your mammy and your pappy.
The company is almost here.
lt's time for this little rascal
to have his nap.
Now kiss your mammy.
And your pappy.
And wave bye-bye to the lady.
And come on with Violet, honey child,
to your little bed. Yeah.
SANDRA:
l wonder if l could have a drink.
Oh, of course.
[PlANO PLAYlNG]
SANDRA:
Maggie, l'm not staying for lunch.
What about Young Pete?
l'm leaving him with his mother.
Come on.
lf you look like that,
people will think l beat you.
lf you don't stop, l will. Now, come on.
