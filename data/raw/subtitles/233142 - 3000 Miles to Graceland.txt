Nice car.
Sweet!
Nice.
You little maggot!
- Come here!
- What are you doing?
This your kid?
He's got the valve caps
to my '59 Caddy.
Is that true, Jesse?
How many times have I told you
to stop stealing from people's cars?
Go on inside. Go!
I'm really sorry about this.
You know how kids can be.
It's all right. No harm done.
Where are you from?
Just sort of passing through.
I said the same thing
about four years ago.
- You from L. A?
- No, ma'am. Jersey City.
What's with this "ma'am" stuff?
- Am I looking that old already?
- No, ma'am.
- There you go again.
- I'm just playing.
- I'm Cybil Waingrow.
- Well, very nice name.
That's with a "C,"
not with an "S."
Really?
Pleasure to meet you, Cybil,
with or without a "C."
- Nice to meet you. Drink coffee?
- That's a start.
Got any money?
Wow! Jersey's 3000 miles from here.
Mom, can I have a Coke?
- I'm talking.
- Mom, why can't...?
I didn't bring my purse with me.
Hey, hang on a second.
Here.
Get whatever you want.
Wow, $5. Thanks, mister.
- Hey, Dorothy.
- Yeah, Jesse?
- You like kids?
- I'm not much the fathering type.
Austin, my ex, named him
after Jesse James.
- Hell of a role model.
- Yeah.
I have 5 bucks.
- Where is Daddy now?
- I don't know. Hard to keep track.
They don't write you back.
- Who cares, anyhow?
- Not me.
You must think I'm some cheap date.
No, sir. I don't know
how you city folks work...
...but here, it takes more than
coffee and a plate of chow...
...to get a sophisticated woman
like me into the sack.
That's for damn sure.
- That cigarette looks good.
- So does that dress.
You're so sweet.
Do I owe you anything?
You know, like...
I didn't mean to offend, I just...
I haven't been with a woman
in a long time.
- Right.
- I'm serious.
Five-and-a-half-years serious.
Oh, my God!
You just got out!
I'm sorry.
Well, I guess we're even.
Wait a minute.
You don't offer money
if it's been nice.
You give her flowers,
or chocolate, or something.
Hey, Murph!
This must be our singer.
Yeah, because we know you can't sing.
But I play a mean guitar.
- Mike.
- Hey, man. You looking...
You look good.
You feel good?
- Enjoying your freedom?
- Ain't free yet.
It's better than that cage we shared.
- Big sky, lots of space.
- Not enough water.
"Not enough water."
It's always something with you.
Well, you know me.
Who's the kid?
I don't know.
Looks like he knows you.
Just because he's packing heat,
doesn't make him my partner.
I'm your partner.
- Ready to play?
- Always ready to play, Murph.
- What's up?
- These your new girlfriends?
What's happening, man?
Franklin.
Get in the back.
- Move over, Gus.
- I got window.
Great, so I get bitch.
That's nice.
What's up?
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah.
Ever shoot anybody with them things?
Didn't think so.
What's the smartest thing
ever come out of a bitch's mouth?
- What?
- Einstein's cock!
That's a good one.
- What are you so quiet about?
- I hate the desert.
- Yeah, for the second time now.
- Check it out!
Deathmatch 3000.
In the red corner, Frank Sinatra.
In the blue corner, Elvis Presley.
I'm talking about the real deal!
Cats scrapping it out!
- Who's going down?
- The Chairman of the Board...
...and the King
are looking mighty mean.
The King lands one
in the Chairman's nuts!
- Hot tamale!
- There it is.
The King slips! He goes down...
...and Old Blue Eyes goes in
for the Italian Necktie!
The King is down!
The King is down! No!
Let me know when you're
gonna do that.
Who said the King is down?
- Let it go.
- Did I say something to you?
Then shut the fuck up.
- Who said it?
- We're just having fun.
I know.
- Who said it?
- I said it, Murphy.
Don't say it anymore.
- It was just a joke.
- It wasn't funny.
Sinatra. Fuck Sinatra.
Nobody fucks with the King.
He's never down.
Hey, Murphy, we all love the King.
That's right.
Elvis would beat Sinatra's ass!
That's right.
What's the best thing
about dating homeless girls?
You can drop them off anywhere.
Let me out!
My ass is all sweaty.
- Murph.
- Good to see you, Jack.
Really good to see you.
Jack, how are you doing?
How does it feel to be out?
- You know how it feels.
- Yes, I do.
- You got them?
- Inside.
Hey, Franklin.
Stop. You're killing me, man.
You're killing me.
Pretty loose group you got.
- I'm gonna dance.
- Dance.
Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot me.
- They dialed in?
- They're good on-stage.
Gonna be some show.
The snakeskin is mine.
- I got that one.
- That's mine.
Hey, Michael.
It's good to see you.
Wanna come in?
No, I can't.
I just wanted to ask you...
Well, maybe for a second or two.
You haven't seen my wallet,
by any chance?
I had it yesterday
at the coffee shop.
- I was just backtracking my steps.
- I haven't seen it.
Jesse, get back here!
Did you take his wallet?
Don't shut that door on me!
Don't lock it.
He does this all the time.
Hand me that little stepladder
over there.
Thank you.
He's like a ferret.
Takes anything...
...and hides it all...
...up...
...here.
Sorry about this.
- There was...
- Money?
$460, yeah.
Is this it?
- Just about.
- Sorry about this.
He really isn't a bad kid.
I'm sure he's an angel.
Wait a minute.
- I can get your money back.
- It's okay. It's just $20.
I'll pay it back to you
with another cup of coffee?
Time to go to work, baby.
Let's do it.
We're at the Riviera casino
and it's International Elvis Week.
What's the big deal?
That porker's been dead for 20 years.
- He was a god.
- And second, he ain't dead.
From Rat Pack to Fat Pack.
Murphy. Murphy!
- Long time no see.
- Back off.
Watch yourself, son.
- That's no way to treat friends.
- Never met you.
- Take a fucking walk.
- Come on, don't be cruel.
Would you?
Thank you.
He looks marvelous.
You look just marvelous!
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you very much.
Sorry.
What's the problem?
Emergency stop on nine.
Probably a couple again.
- Do we have visual?
- No. Camera in car eight is down.
Bring it down for a check.
Have security waiting.
All right, everybody stay cool.
Back up.
White is light, red is dead.
I'll only say this once.
Who's listening?
I am.
In the corner, now.
On your knees, heads down.
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
He's deaf!
Put his head on the ground.
50s and 100s, no cellophane.
Holy shit!
Main booth, scramble security.
Call Vegas P.D.
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
- Let's go.
- Come on.
Come on, Gus!
Let's go, Gus.
God bless America.
Do not engage on the floor,
direct them to B-41.
/ntercept at B-41.
They're at registration.
Vegas P.D. En route.
Right at VIP.
Let me know if they follow, Hanson.
Statîon 3, where are you?
They're coming.
Nothing will happen here.
Left at $ 1 slots.
Relax, Gus. They're moving us.
Anyone gets between us
and Michael, it's on.
They're in B-41.
Freeze! Hold it right there.
Everyone we got, now, scramble!
Go!
Give me the camera!
Missed me, bitch!
Come on!
Let's go! Franklin, let's go!
Come on!
Knock them down, Michael!
- Blow them!
- Let's go!
Freeze! Vegas P.D.!
Get the gun!
Take us up, Mike!
Franklin's hit!
- Franklin, come on!
- You'll make it!
Fourteen, fifteen, one to go!
Clear!
Where the hell is he?
- Christ, Murph, what's the deal?
- Fuck!
He'll be here.
Helicopter!
Let's go!
Ladîes and gentlemen, Elvîs...
...has left the building!
Hang in there!
- You're gonna make it!
- You'll be okay!
I'm dying!
- Put pressure on it!
- You're not dying!
I won't make it!
- Hang on!
- Help me!
Is he gonna make it?
Fuck him.
How you doing?
Where's the pisser?
- Nice place.
- A real shit hole.
Gus, give me a hand.
- Oh, yeah.
- That's a lot of money.
$3.2 million.
$3.2 million?
- That's a beautiful thing.
- Less Jack's 10 percent.
Right.
Damn. That's a lot of money
just to fly a helicopter.
Would you rather we used
an air balloon?
- No.
- Or maybe hang gliders?
- You'd rather use hang gliders?
- I don't know how.
I doubt you know
how to fly a helicopter.
If you ask me, $320,000
is well worth it.
Jack's taking care of shit...
...you don't know anything about.
Back to business.
- Where is Franklin's pile?
- What are you talking about?
Franklin. Remember him?
Franklin's dead.
Right. So where's Franklin's pile?
We don't make him a pile.
We split up four ways.
Wrong. It does not get split up.
- Sure, I'm good with that.
- Bullshit!
Who gets that 15 percent, then?
It was my deal, Hanson.
No, I want that 15 percent
split up four ways.
- You want?
- Yeah, I want.
I could give a flying fuck
what you want.
A deal is a deal.
Let me put it this way.
That deal died with Franklin.
It's time to make a new deal.
That's a commitment.
I'll give you that.
Fuck it. We shot everybody else,
let's start shooting each other.
Let's just settle down, all right?
We don't need this.
Let's just keep this simple.
I'll take my 15%, plus 25%,
and I'll take it now.
- That won't happen.
- Why not?
Because when plans change,
things get fucked up!
Be a little more flexible.
The plan stays!
We have an arrangement
in Twin Falls...
...where we'll get 70 cents
on the dollar.
All of us.
Then I'm going to Canada.
You can all get on his boat...
...for all I care.
- No.
- Nobody gets on my boat but me.
- Right. Whatever.
Before, there's a chance
you'll spend it.
Then you'll get popped.
And the chances are you'll talk.
I'm not taking that chance.
I've never dropped dime on anybody.
Want to keep blowing smoke,
or should I blow your head off?
You go do what you gotta do
in Twin Falls or wherever.
That's your criminal right.
I'm staying here.
You two are the ones
with the hot sheets.
I should be as far away
from you as possible.
You fucks are the weakest
part of the plan.
We don't trust each other,
so we'll travel north as a group.
So think of us as the Osmonds,
only we don't get along.
Gentlemen, this job is done.
I'm cashing out.
Just give me my money.
Is that an order?
No, come on.
That wasn't an order.
Technically it wasn't.
- What about you, Gus?
- What?
You think this is your money?
No. This is my money.
That's your money.
I just want to get on the move.
Makes you the only pig
in the room, Hanson.
You make me laugh, you know?
You've got a sick mind.
I think you believe you're
the King himself.
And those sideburns?
I glued mine for the job.
For you it's a lifestyle.
- Shut up.
- I'm serious!
- Shut up.
- It's fucking sad, man.
- But I know the golden rule.
- What's that, sweetheart?
Fuck the gold.
He who has the nickel plating
makes the rules.
- You shot him!
- That's right, Gus.
Now, I'll kill him.
Sweetheart.
Wrap him up.
Wrap him up.
Wrap him up!
Fuck!
- Anybody?
- No.
We need some towels!
He's bleeding all over.
Hey, Murph.
How will we split it now?
Damn, this boy is heavy.
He had too many peanut butter
and fried banana sandwiches.
God!
You need a ride, fella?
Thanks.
Fuck!
A raîd as wîld and as darîng
as anythîng seen în Amerîca.
The Rîvîera Hotel and Casîno
exploded în gunfîre...
... durîng the /nternatîonal
Elvîs Conventîon.
Where's Jesse?
- Come here!
- What the hell?
- Where is that damn money?
- I don't know.
I'm calling the cops right now.
911 operator. State your emergency.
Yes, hello.
Hello?
Thîs îs the 911 operator.
Hello, ma 'am?
Ma 'am?
I thought you'd change your mind.
Where did you get that?
You're the one. The casino in Vegas.
It's all over the news.
That's you.
- Get over there and sit down.
- Go.
That's $ 100,000 in there.
Just for you to keep your mouth shut.
You don't have to pay me off.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.
No, you're not.
I need a couple days.
Then do whatever the hell you want.
Everything is understood?
I got it.
Well.
Hey, Elvis.
Any chance I might
be able to see you again?
Sorry, Cybil.
- Are you 100% sure of that?
- Yeah, 100,000%.
- I need your car.
- What?
The Valiant. Where are the keys?
I'm not giving that to you.
Yeah, you are.
I gave you $ 100,000 for it.
I don't care how much you gave me.
It's not my car.
It's my grandmother's.
- You either give me the keys...
- Or what?
You're gonna kill us?
- There's a simple solution.
- Yeah, there is.
You can take us with you.
- What?
- Why not? Where are you going?
I haven't got time for this.
You got three seconds...
...or I'll splatter
cherry pie on that wall.
I'm serious about that.
One, two...
Stop pointing that gun at my mom.
Who's there?
The police.
Open the door, please.
Mom, money!
Sit down.
Sit down!
Mom, get the door.
Can I help you?
Evening. We received
a 911 call from this room.
Are you sure?
The call was disconnected.
Everything okay?
It's fine.
We were just leaving.
Can we come in, ma'am?
Of course.
Elvîs împersonators made ît up
to the roof...
... and were taken by helîcopter.
Are you the man of the house?
We just got engaged.
- Congratulations.
- We're really excited.
We're going to the Grand Canyon.
Get your stuff.
I'll be right back.
So which of you is the one
who dialed 911?
I'm sorry.
I was trying to dial 411,
but I dialed nine by mistake.
I guess we're all set here.
- We'll be on our way.
- So are we. Come on.
Can I give you a hand?
If you don't mind.
We got a lot of books.
It would be my pleasure.
We'll be right there.
Come on.
Bye-bye!
You guys are federal marshals?
If not, we'd better give these back.
Good morning.
Not for them it isn't.
Morning. Vegas Homicide.
What do you got, Vegas?
No IDs.
Looks like this one was digging.
Someone drilled him.
Two to the heart.
Three spent.45 casings,
probably more in the sand.
And this is interesting.
Slightly deformed.45 slug.
Vest.
Tell me something.
How did that money get up there?
Jesse put it up there.
It's a little heavy for him.
- You're paranoid.
- I think you tried to steal my money.
You don't deserve it.
You're an amateur.
Stealing it wouldn't have
done you any good.
The money is marked, missy.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
The news said it was untraceable.
- The news doesn't lie.
- Sure.
When the idiots try to spend it,
they get caught.
You want to know why, Cybil?
Because they were dumb
and listened to the news.
- I never thought about it that way.
- I guess not.
I'm pulling off here.
I can't drive anymore. I gotta sleep.
Can I help you?
Can you pump gas?
Good, nobody does anymore.
Fill it up.
You all be cool now.
- What happened to your nose?
- What happened to your hair?
We just came from
another interrogation.
Why do they call it a head-butt?
- I didn't hit that prick in the ass.
- Yeah, that's true.
I would have come forward sooner,
but I was getting my beak mended.
I heard about the robbery after.
Here I am, in the flesh.
- I'll tell you the same.
- Which is what?
- / knew one of them.
- You're certaîn of that?
He's a real crazy motherfucker.
He was...
... sînîster, you know?
Some creepy, freaky,
level-9 type shît.
Dark.
Lîable to shove a snake
up the coochîes of women.
Watch out for that one.
Wherever he go,
trouble bound to follow.
Oh, my God! Is he dead?
Jumper cables might help.
Did it hurt?
- That's a funny question.
- Well, did it?
- I think maybe the first one did.
- I could call the cops, you know.
You could try.
Allow me.
Need some spot welding?
This guy you know...
He's a real Elvis impersonator?
- Remember when the King died in '77?
- Jesus, was it '77?
His will stated that Lisa Marie...
...along with any
illegitimate child...
...be entitled to his estate.
So, I came forward.
- Naturally.
- Then we met.
- Did "him" have a name?
- Yeah. Murphy.
Thomas Murphy.
Where are you headed?
Can I come?
Can I?
Go get your bubble gum.
- Smoke?
- No.
But I do everything else.
It's a nasty habit.
Our musîc...
Rock'n 'roll musîc îs basîcally...
... gospel or rhythm blues.
I did not try to steal your money!
Besides, that was then
and this is now.
And I should trust you now?
Why steal the golden egg
when I got the whole goose?
I'm flying solo as soon
as we clean the money.
I'm supposed to trust you?
- Why not?
- You're a bank robber.
I'm not a bank robber, okay?
You'll be set up with
a little something, okay?
A little something?
I hope it's my idea
of a lot of something.
- 100,000 little somethings.
- Can you just...
...shut up, please?
Not beîng able to touch hands
wîth body, or body wîth hands...
Is that better?
How about a down payment
on that little something?
Did I say little?
That's not what I meant.
Harder.
Murph?
- Mack.
- How is it on the road?
Good.
- Where's your mob headed?
- Reno.
Ever been to Reno?
Get your bubble gum.
Where are we going to clean the cash?
- Don't worry about the cleaner.
- What's the password?
- What?
- For the cleaner guy.
You've never seen him before.
- So?
- So, you need a password.
How will he know
if you're a cop or not?
All right.
I got it written down.
So once we clean the cash
and get new IDs...
...we're home free.
You don't understand.
There is no "we."
I'm home free. Me.
You are whatever you are.
Fine.
You want a beverage?
- I'm good, thank you.
- No, get to work.
What do you got?
I got this big, fat file
on Thomas J. Murphy.
- Jesse, don't forget what I told you.
- I know what to do.
More coffee, sir?
Sure.
Scoot over and let Mommy out.
Where are you going?
"More coffee, sir?"
To the little girls' room.
Don't fall in.
You like my mom?
- She likes you.
- Yeah, we're a couple of coconuts.
My mom's jealous of that waitress.
She has bigger boobs.
Do you like bigger boobs?
Stay.
- Everything copacetic?
- Big word.
- Finish your fries.
- I don't have to.
You're not my father.
- Kids starve in Africa.
- Will you send them my fries?
Why did you rob a casino?
Because everybody else robs banks.
Nowadays you gotta be original.
Catch them off guard,
piece of cake.
That's criminal talk, isn't it?
Like "cherry pie on the wall."
Good one.
- Glad you liked it.
- Casinos are original.
- How many have you done?
- One.
One? One casino?
- That is really lame, if you ask me.
- Well, I didn't.
Goddamn it!
Goddamn you, Cybil, stop this car!
You gonna pay for this?
Where the hell is my wallet?

Peterson's Antique Refurbishing.
Naomi speaking.
- I'm trying to reach Jay Peterson.
- One moment.
There's a woman on the phone for you.
How can I help you?
Cleanliness is next to Godliness.
- Alarm, see?
- Yeah, you're right.
- Kid, this one here.
- My name's Jesse James, not "kid."
Move your ass and pop the hood.
Good job.
Open this door right now.
Open this door. Open it right now!
Now, you little worm!
Shit!
- Don't move!
- All right!
Unlock the door.
Unlock the door!
- Yes, / do.

I'll be there with bells on!
Give me five...
...hundred thousand!
Mr. Peterson!
I'm sorry. I tried to announce him.
It's all right, honey.
He's here now.
What can I do for you?
You're Jay Peterson?
Either that, or I'm wearing
someone else's underwear.
It's a joke!
I don't joke.
You don't have an appointment either.
So, what can I do for you?
Cleanliness is next to Godliness.
I've been hearing that a lot, lately.
Are you a hunter or something?
Me too.
That's nice.
All right, listen.
There's something you should know.
Someone just called with the password.
She's on her way.
- Good.
- So why are you here?
I'm here to keep things honest.
You kill this one too?
Either you or him?
Is that a joke?
That's right, you don't do that.
Listen up.
Things have changed.
You guys are all over the news.
This thing is messy.
So?
It's gonna be 50 cents on the dollar,
with things being the way they are.
No. The deal was 70.
You almost hit me!
You should've called first.
- Why didn't you call?
- Ever kill this close?
What are you, nuts?
Probably.
Fuck!
Okay, it doesn't have to be 50 cents.
- Fucked the wrong guy.
- I know.
Show me the money.
Don't just jerk me off.
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.
Why don't we wait for the girl?
I'll show you mine,
and you show me yours.
- Why don't I shoot you?
- No, please.
Show me you're playing straight
with me. Open the safe.
- I can't.
- Open the safe!
Bathroom.
Make it quick.
We can't pay for this.
What do you say?
- Sorry, sir.
- No problem, little dude.
You afraid?
Can't make your fingers work?
You think they felt that?
Ever scare one to death?
- What's with the girl?
- What?
You're so fucking ugly.
What's the deal?
Does the wife know about her?
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I'm just killing time.
- Are you gonna kill me?
- After you open the safe.
Now, that's a joke.
Open the safe.
I never killed any of them.
- What?
- The animals.
I bought them.
They're just for show.
To impress my friends.
I go with the girl
and my wife...
...thinks I'm in Africa.
I'm sorry.
- I'm a fucking pussy, I mean...
- Wow, Jay, that's a lot.
That's a lot to hold back.
Now, open the safe.
All right.
We're in business.
Let's have a drink.
Mr. Peterson?
Come on in!
We were just talking about Mexico.
And being scared to death, right, Jay?
Hi.
Mr. Peterson?
In the flesh.
- You need a hand with that?
- No, I got it.
- Quite a load you got there.
- A load?
- Laundry. I get it.
- A little industry humor.
Do you want the password?
Just to verify that it's really me?
- Sure. If you wouldn't mind.
- Not at all.
I know how these things work.
- Cleanliness is next to Godliness.
- Perfect.
You scared me.
I wasn't sure you were the right guy.
Oh, I'm the right guy, all right.
- Mind if I look around?
- Not at all.
If you see something you like,
consider it a gift.
Thank you.
Jesse, you stay here.
- This one is beautiful.
- That's one of my favorites.
Yeah?
- Where is it from?
- Up my ass.
Excuse me?
- It's an African piece.
- Looks Egyptian to me.
You got a bathroom around here?
In the back, through the office.
Thank you.
- I told you to wait in the car.
- Is that my mom?
- I wanna see!
- No!
That's not her.
- We're going to find your mom, Jesse.
- You're lying.
She's headed to the same place we are.
- No bullshit?
- No bullshit.
Do you like women with large breasts?
Or women with huge breasts?
I'll go with huge to block.
What do you make of this:
A '59 Caddy pulls
out of a gas station...
...shortly before the place blows up.
- Where?
- Ely, Nevada.
About 300 miles north of Las Vegas.
Then last night, 400 miles
north of Ely in Twin Falls, Idaho...
...some antique dealer
slash money washer, alleged...
...is found dead
near an open and empty safe.
I got $50 on Boise.
You want a piece of that?
Hey, man, watch the hair.
- Where'd you get this?
- Like it?
I do like it. A lot.
- I didn't know you smoked.
- Yeah, once in a while.
Filters are for pussies
and guys my age.
Here. That's how young guys
in the joint smoke them.
Try that.
- Pretty good?
- Yeah, real good.
Want another one?
You made your point.
Why don't you make me your partner?
I wouldn't let you down.
What if I helped you
get to Murphy?
- Would you make me your partner?
- No.
- Why not?
- You bring nothing to the table, okay?
Where's your car, Mr. Smarty?
With Murphy,
Mr. L-blow-chunks-when-l-smoke.
- He's driving your stolen car.
- Yeah, Murphy's driving my stolen...
I want to report my car stolen.
It's a fire-engine red '59 Cadillac.
Yeah, Coupe de Ville.
License plate 3-K-M-T-G.
Step out of the car, now.
Okay, thanks a lot.
God!
Step out of the vehicle, please.
Cheerleaders!
- Come on, stud.
- Cheerleaders!
What are you in for?
Jaywalking or a visitor's pass?
Nothing that romantic.
Grand theft, truck.
Yeah?
- Is that it?
- So far.
Reporting the car stolen.
Damn risky, if you ask me.
Clever, though.
Had I known you were that smart,
I might not have shot you.
I did shoot you, didn't I?
- Where's Cybil?
- Cybil?
Cybil with a "C"?
Where do you think she is, Mike?
You are fucked up.
You're a piece of shit.
You'd have done the same...
...if she double-crossed you.
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?
You still haven't figured it out?
You didn't even know her.
- Not very well. But I knew you.
- You're reaching.
- Am I?
- You had no reason.
Same reason you stayed with her.
Average American family
out on the road.
- Why didn't you go back to the motel?
- I did.
Fucking coyotes.
- Coyotes.
- Yeah, no shit.
Two of them.
I took one in the grill.
Woke up sucking on the steering wheel.
Face it, you got played.
It didn't matter to her
who the $ 100,000 came from.
I'm trying to face that myself.
It's all bullshit.
She told you anything
you could beat out of her.
You're right.
She fell so in love with you...
...that she shit-cans the deal
with me and takes off...
...with you,
the man of her dreams.
That was the deal you got, right?
$ 100,000?
Oh, Mike.
You know the difference between us?
You always try to do the right thing,
in a bad situation.
- Zane, Michael.
- Yeah.
- Right here.
- Right here.
Somebody here to see you about bail.
I know this guy. Can I have a second?
Make it quick.
So, where did you hide the money,
Murph...
...in the trunk of my car?
Instant karma is a motherfucker,
isn't it?
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you.
You want karma, asshole?
You find the money,
you'll find the girl.
Hey, Zane!
Find me.
Could I please make my phone call?
Superior Court now in session.
Judge Carmody presiding.
Mr. Zane?
Who are you?
Otto Sinclair.
I'm from 1-800-1 -GO-FREE.
Mr. Waingrow called me.
- Who?
- Mr. Jesse Waingrow.
- Little shit.
- Charming little feller.
- I'm getting out?
- That depends.
- What?
- Mr. Waingrow purchased the bond...
...provided you enter
into a partnership.
You're kidding.
No, Mr. Zane. I am not.
Ridiculous. It says 50%!
Yes, it does.
Zane, you're up next.
Decide.
I don't want to waste time.
You shoplifted in the wrong state.
I'm recommending a two-year sentence.
See you in court.
- Michael Zane!
- Good luck.
Hang on a second.
Two years?
Let me see that again.
Jack? Jack, it's me.
Thîngs got a lîttle crazy.
I can't go into everything right now.
/'m în a holdîng tank în Boîse.
I'm under the name Jonathan Liebling.
/ have to make baîl...
...before my prints come back,
understand?
Completely.
Bring a couple of guys...
... to that place Mîchael
set up for us.
I'll have you out in an hour.
Good.
Fifty percent, huh?
See you Tuesday morning, 9:00?
Yeah, right.
Come on.
1-800-1 -GO-FREE.
Yeah, Jack.
I'll need your license.
'59 Caddy, red.
Row nine.
Yeah, no shît.
/ took one în the grîll.
Woke up suckîng on the steerîng wheel.
Get in the car, Jesse.
I got good news and bad news.
Your mom's in the trunk.
- What's the bad news?
- She's alive.
Are you okay?
Baby, give me a hug!
I'm so sorry, baby.
I thought you were dead.
You knew I was coming back.
What's going on here, Cybil?
What?
There's more money here than we took.
- I don't know about that.
- Of course not.
I've been sucking on gas fumes.
Don't look at me like that!
Are you okay?
You're good.
You really are.
That's a nice touch.
Relief from a loving mother
reuniting with her lost son...
...who she left with a sucker
she stole from.
- I did not set you up!
- Bullshit!
- What?
- Murphy told me.
Surprised? Never mind.
Murphy lied to you and you know it!
No. You lied to me.
You stole my car, my money
and left your son with a stranger.
Let me tell you something.
The Valiant is my grandmother's car.
That is the casino's money,
not yours.
And get this straight...
...I did not leave my son
with a stranger.
I left him with you!
You can turn this around.
You're good at that.
Don't tell me you didn't
take the money.
I took it. I did. I've got two people
to take care of on my own...
...and you made it clear
that wouldn't change, so I took it!
All right.
We gotta change cars.
We're never gonna see you again,
are we?
Yeah. Whatever. Whatever.
They let him go in Boise.
Murphy? Shit!
Hop in! Come on!
Wombats?
State champions.
Big exhibition game up north.
- What the fuck is a wombat, anyway?
- A small, little, furry animal.
Something like a hedgehog.
- Where are you headed?
- Seattle works.
The whole department is embarrassed
over this incident.
But we don't make the laws,
we just enforce them.
Jesus.
Is that from the Barney Fife
seminar on law enforcement?
- What was the weapon?
- It was twin.45s.
We need those.
The trooper was killed with a.45.
What else was in the car?
I'll get right on that.
Johnny.
What do you think?
It's 3000 miles to Graceland, so...
...I want to catch this asshole
before he jumps to Canada.
There's never any traffic
around here.
There sure are enough cops, though.
Do me a favor.
- Put it in park.
- What for?
My contact...
...I don't want the car rolling
while I work on it.
Okay.
Beat and bust them
That's our custom
Wombats
Here we go, Wombats
Here we go
- Traveling alone?
- Not unless you count team spirit.
Go, Wombats!
I have a new one. Listen.
Pork chop, pork chop
Greasy, greasy
We beat theîr fuckîng team
Easy, easy
Go, Wombats!
Do me a favor,
take it easy on the beer, okay?
Gas.
Jesse...
...go wait by the taxi.
- Thanks for taking care of him.
- Other way around.
- Can I talk you into staying?
- I'm headed for Mount Vernon.
- Your boat.
- Yeah.
Here.
- What's this?
- All of it.
Except for $ 100,000 I earned.
Come on.
- That's a lot of money.
- Sure is.
- I'm entitled to an answer.
- Why can't you...?
I felt something
the minute I saw you.
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.
Please, stop.
We should be together.
- What do you want?
- To stay with you!
It's not that simple.
Yes, it is that simple!
I don't even know who's
talking to me here!
I can't trust you.
No matter how much I'd like to,
I'll never be able to.
- That's it, isn't it?
- What?
It's not me you can't trust.
It's you!
Glad you think so.
She didn't talk you into staying, huh?
No, she didn't.
I really liked being your partner.
You're a pretty good partner.
- No bullshit?
- No bullshit.
Listen, I gotta go.
I can't fucking believe this.
Did you see me?
It's him!
That's right. It's me.
Mom, on the right!
Son of a bitch!
Twat!
Mom, he's coming up on the left!
Mom, where is he?
Oh, my God!
Mom, wake up!
Jesse, come on!
- You stay away from us!
- Things work out better sometimes...
...when I don't kill.
Touch her and I'll kill you!
You want to fight?
You want to fight?
Now, what I want is my money.
All of it!
And you're going to get it for me.
We don't know where Michael is.
You don't know where he is?
I got a good idea where he is.
I'll hold on to this shit...
...while you go and find him for me.
Get up.
I wondered if you'd return.
I've been busy.
Where do we stand?
That's $ 130,000 you owe
for the loan...
...and $24,000 for five years
of dock pay and maintenance.
- How are you planning to pay for this?
- Cash is king.
- Slug bug blue!
- What was that?
It's a kids' game. See?
My mom and I,
when we're in the car a lot.
Well, you're no kid.
- You don't scare me.
- I don't believe I do, do I?
I guess your mama taught you well.
She did.
What's your mama's excuse?
Slug bug yellow.
You don't want to play no more?
Michael!
Murphy has Jesse.
He wants the money.
Michael, please.
My dad left me this boat
a long time ago.
I never even knew him.
Pretty cool?
- Please, talk to me.
- So you and Murph just...
...ran into each other?
What am I going to do?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, what have I done?
I want you to listen to me, okay?
- We're going to get Jesse back.
- No, we're not.
I promise we'll get him back.
All right.
What are we going to do?
What everybody should do
in this situation.
Call the cops.
Hey, handsome. Either quit smoking
or get a new lighter.
I like that one.
You guys got a call.
- There's gonna be a meeting tonight.
- Where?
Duck River Wood Mill, Seattle.
- Still going north. Anything else?
- A name. Thomas J. Murphy.
Don't worry.
These guys just want their name
in the paper.
Nothing will happen to me.
- Nice.
- I thought you'd like that one.
I do.
- Who's carrying this?
- Got you written all over it.
Good, Jack.
You wanted firepower?
I give you Hamilton.
I told you to bring a couple of guys.
Trust me, he is a couple of guys.
Who's the kid?
First of all, he ain't no kid.
He's four and a half feet of money.
I like him already.
Keep him alive until the money
is in my hands.
Are you hungry? Want a sandwich?
No.
Come on, kid.
Even tough guys have got to eat.
Do you want a jelly sandwich?
Yeah.
Gîve me TAC, HRT and SWA T.
I don't care where you get them.
Seattle is fine! Just get them.
Hey, Jack.
Glad you made it on time.
- Where's the boy?
- Some job we pulled.
Don't need you.
I'd like to get this over with.
Let's go find Murph.
He's right here.
Don't.
- You okay, Jesse?
- He's fine.
Let's make the trade.
What's the rush?
- You looked forward to this.
- Cybil's down there.
We're not back in five,
she makes a call.
You're not calling the cops.
- Throw the bag over.
- No problem.
Send Jesse.
Jack will bring you the money.
You go slow.
You make one move...
He'll splatter cherry pie
over the wall.
- He's got the lingo down.
- Keep coming, Jesse.
Come on, Jack.
Good.
I'll just walk out...
...and you got the money.
That's very generous,
but it's not that simple.
- I hope that's you, Hamilton.
- Yeah, I'm on the money.
Go start the plane.
We're out of here.
He's a bad guy, kid.
Maybe not as bad as me.
He's bad. Michael, along with
all the other bad guys...
...seems to be missing the point.
You're all forgetting the rule.
The golden rule.
- And that is...
- He who has the gun makes the rules.
It would help if the gold
was actually in the bag.
I hope you haven't ruined this.
This could've been easy.
I'm gonna check...
...just to be sure.
What the...?
Fucking newspaper!
Damn it!
- What the fuck?
- Run, Jesse, run!
Federal marshals!
Hands in the air!
Fuck!
All right, that's good.
Now lower the weapons.
Guns down, now!
You said five minutes, Mike.
Yeah, I lied.
See? You are a bad guy.
Guys like me die caught.
Guys like you...
...you can die bloody.
It's up to you.
Me? I'm going back.
Yeah, you're going back.
- Don't turn around!
- You're going in a bag.
Run, kid!
Fuck!
Get a paramedic!
That was stupid.
I'm through asking, Thomas Murphy.
Step out now!
Was he really...
...your old man?
Who's gonna fly the plane?
Motherfuckers.
I cannot let you leave here!
Understand?
That's the last of it, kid.
I'll cover you.
If you don't come out,
we're coming in!
You don't want any of me!
- Hold on. Which one is he?
- It's not Murphy.
I gotta get him out!
Oh, God!
No, this way!
Do you recognize me now?
Because I recognize you.
Hold.
Nobody shoots!
He's not giving up.
Fuck!
Make sure everybody is all right.
I really wanted to get him alive.
I'm glad he didn't give up.
I wouldn't have.
Fellas! A little cleanup here.
Thanks.
Federal marshals exchanged gunfire...
...with the men responsible
for the casino robbery.
They were killed,
along with several officers.
Unfortunately, the men
associated with the robbery are dead.
- The money may never be recovered.
- Seen my ambulance?
These things really work.
Help me up.
I thought you died.
I did.
- A-Marker.
- Action!
You're going back, all right.
You're going back...
...to the future, man!
Stay where you are.
