She's incredible.
I wonder what she'll have.
She's hesitating.
I love hesitating women.
What'll she choose? Coffee?
No, too ordinary.
It's better than decaf.
Decaf is so dreary.
Tea?
No, juice would be good.
Not just any juice.
Nothing too exotic.
Papaya or guava are scary.
Nothing as humdrum
as orange or apple.
No, the best would be
apricot juice.
If she orders apricot juice,
I'll speak to her.
Ready to order?
I'll have a coffee.
Juice...
Apricot juice.
"La delicatesse"
Think all couples do this?
What?
A pilgrimage to the place they met.
Of course. We'll come every year
and light a candle.
And maybe
we could put a gold plaque here.
You're so funny...
And I swear...
And I swear to God...
and to you, Your Eminence...
Now give me your hand.
Bravo!
We should be on stage.
Mercy! Act? Never.
Actresses are such a drag!
They perform all the time!
Thank you, Sophie.
You sell programmes so well.
Oh, no, Nathalie
is the best programme-seller ever!
- You do programmes so well.
- It's over.
Thank you so much.
Excuse me.
The full programme of the play!
Get the programme!
Five euros. Thank you.
Get the programme!
Ok? Coming for a drink?
No, I...
"I'll go home to my baby."
You can't understand.
You don't know a thing about love.
- What?
- You two, it's just a sex thing.
You bet!
Is it that obvious?
- Have a good evening.
- Bye.
Come on then, sex thing.
With Francois, time flashes by.
It's as if he can skip days,
make weeks without Thursdays.
Is that what happiness is?
No more Thursdays?
Penny for your thoughts?
Oh, God!
- You scared me!
- Sorry.
Forgive me.
Why are you here?
No reason...
Want to get married?
What?
I could have done better...
Something more romantic.
A candle-lit dinner...
And a ring.
I'd have kneeled like this.
I can't even do this right.
Nathalie, will you be my wife?
Are you serious?
It'll be wonderful being my wife.
I like this photo.
There's good sense in her face.
Yes, odd for an office.
It gets me down.
But it keeps the shareholders happy.
We're very Swedish here.
This is from Ikea,
of course.
At least that makes you smile.
Any views on Sweden?
Sweden?
Not really.
That's Sweden.
No one knows what to say.
Forgive me...
Your CV is very interesting.
Are you married?
- Yes.
- Good luck.
Sorry. Bad joke.
Planning on kids?
Yes. But not right away.
You wouldn't say,
"Not until I'm hired."
Sorry, I'm a little tense.
Your application is very interesting.
Yes...
Really interesting.
Thank you.
A krisproll?
No, thank you.
Get used to them. They're all we eat.
- You mean...
- Yes.
Welcome.
We always used to go to the sea.
Nathalie loved it as a girl.
We haven't drunk to Nathalie yet!
That's right!
Cheers, dear!
Here's to you. You can keep me now.
Very funny.
- Cheers.
- Good health!
Don't cross glasses!
That's bad luck.
With a job, think about grandkids.
Don't pressure us.
We want to live first.
A kid doesn't mean you stop living.
Just leave us alone, ok.
It's as if we're all you talk about.
Why don't you tell us
about your plans?
Well, my plan is...
to die at a very old age.
Dad...
And before your mother.
Stop it!
I can't cook for myself.
I'd starve as a widower.
- Who wants a drop more? Dad?
- Please.
- You've had enough.
- It's ok.
Think of his liver.
His liver's a free man.
No. Your mother's right.
Excellent tactic.
Lull the beast then take a drop more.
Not at all.
- Cheese?
- No, skip it.
- Dessert?
- Dessert. And coffee.
At the same time.
Couldn't your dad have been a racist?
Or your mum a pain
like a normal mother-in-law?
It's just not possible.
We never even argue with them.
They'll be here until dinner...
Let's throw them out.
Come on, let's do it.
Our place was tiny.
Ours wasn't that big either.
This is coffee.
Know what? You're right
about us having a child.
We'll try now.
Have a nice Sunday.
You really want to?
Yes.
But we said not right away.
Not right away.
We'll put it on hold.
For when we're talked out.
Close the curtains.
What's going on?
Oh, no. I hate this...
Since starting here,
I must have walked 2,000 miles
and drunk 1,095 coffees.
Good morning.
No, 1,094.
I had tea yesterday.
- Hello, Nathalie.
- Hello, Chloe.
How are you?
Fine but I got stuck in the lift.
It's on the blink?
Only for me.
You worked late?
I don't even know why I went home.
Oh, no! It's too early.
I'm not answering.
- Nathalie?
- Yes, sir.
Well done for that job on 112.
Stop by later.
I want to congratulate you personally.
Very good, Mr Delamain.
It's harassment.
It's Friday, everyone will be gone.
Harassment?
He wouldn't say boo to a goose.
But he might goose you.
How do you do it?
What?
With men.
It's all so simple for you.
Take Frederic, my boyfriend.
We never understand each other.
I left him but he refused to accept it.
He slept on my doormat for ten days.
I was so embarrassed
for the neighbours.
So I took him back.
And then he left.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Chloe...
Can we talk about this later?
There's a lot to do today.
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry.
Make less noise.
I need to warm up.
You look pretty stupid in shorts.
What?
Seen these calves?
European Calf Champion 1996.
Right, I'm off.
Hello?
Yes...
All right.
Nathalie!
Why are you here?
- Where is he?
- We can't see him yet.
But I want to see him!
When can I see him?
I don't know.
Come on, you must know!
Calm down.
Your husband was rammed by a car.
We had to operate.
He's on a respirator.
You have to wake him, ok?
You have to wake him!
What if I fixed this moment?
What if I walled myself up in grief?
I'm so sorry.
My thoughts are with you.
I know, Grandma.
I want to go home.
- Right now.
- Let's go.
I'll fetch the car.
Thinking of you. Michel & Lucie
Delete
Are you ok, dear?
People are worrying about you.
I'm ok, mum. I'm ok.
I just need to be alone.
Give Gran
or Francois' parents a call.
I don't want to talk
but I'm not suicidal, ok.
I'm sorry.
I know you mean well.
Why don't you come home?
I'll look after you.
I've brought you food.
I'm not hungry.
Well I want you to eat.
Let's warm it up.
It's ratatouille.
I cook each vegetable separately.
If it's too much, it'll keep.
Nathalie?
If I could build up
A sun, an empire
Without thinking twice
100,000 times I'd do it for you
If I could change everything
And if I could challenge death
I would go to seek for you
Never to leave you again
If the light of dawn
Could bring back your hands
Your body and your warmth, my love
I'd no longer be afraid
When I close my eyes
I hear your voice and I hope
To find you again at last
My sweet love for all eternity
Is he in?
Yes...
Yes, I'm back at work.
You could have taken your time.
I want to spend my time here.
Don't spare me, sir,
just pile the work on.
That's all I ask.
All right.
It's good to see you.
That's a bit familiar.
Well, there comes a time when...
Are you offended?
No.
I just wondered.
Try using my first name too.
She's so beautiful.
Well? How is she?
It's terrible but tragedy makes her
even more beautiful.
I'm sorry. I'm late.
That's ok, I could spend hours here.
How are you?
Great.
How did work go?
Fine.
That's all?
It's fine.
But people make me feel
like a sort of explosive.
To be handled with care.
They're being kind.
Yes, I know.
But I think I need them
to be normal with me, you see?
That's not easy.
- They're bound to think about it.
- I know.
I'm the same.
I'm your friend and I love you
but I don't know how to behave...
What I can say...
If something might upset you...
You can be frank with me.
I'm bound to wonder
how to tell you news.
If it's the right time...
You're pregnant?
Yes.
That's fantastic!
No crying, ok.
Violette, come here, sweetheart.
Come here...
Got a kiss for Auntie Nathalie?
You're growing so fast.
Let's go home now.
Want Auntie Nathalie to carry you?
What shall we do at home?
Have a little nap?
It's a joy working with her.
She can be a bit obsessive
and hyperactive at times.
She works on a case until it's closed.
She can send you an email at 2 am.
Since her husband died,
she's done nothing but work
these last 3 years.
Thanks for the introduction.
Good morning, everyone.
I'm very happy about this new project.
We'll form an autonomous group
accountable only to itself.
We'll handle our own cases...
I'll be available at all times.
Don't hesitate to come and see me
with your needs and doubts.
Professional ones only.
We'll begin
with an individual chat each.
I'll start with Chloe.
I know her so it won't take long.
I don't know what to say.
It doesn't matter.
They must wonder
what fate has in store for them.
I said a lot of good about you.
Chloe...
You think work is all I have now?
I love this place.
I don't come often but...
I didn't know it.
It's cozy.
Very welcoming.
Good evening.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
An aperitif?
Yes. We'll have champagne.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
A vintage rose champagne.
We're celebrating.
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you.
It's ages since I drank.
Maybe I can't take it.
Good. I've been trying
to dine with you for so long...
You couldn't refuse
with a promotion to celebrate.
It's good to get out.
I don't know what's good.
I just do what I feel.
In any case...
I'm very, very happy you're here.
Cheers then.
To our future projects.
- Did you enjoy that?
- It was wonderful.
The dessert menu?
No thanks, not for me.
Let's take a look anyway.
All right.
I've drunk enough.
No. No limits tonight.
Can you drive?
I don't know.
I'm not wondering about later.
I just want to enjoy this.
You're not attracted to me?
Why do you ask?
Why don't you answer?
Because...
Because I don't know.
Don't you think you should move on?
I don't mean forget...
But you can't stay isolated forever.
You know I can be there for you.
You're married.
Forget my wife.
You know what our relationship's like.
Why not get divorced then?
I would, for you.
No, not for me.
Please, don't get any dessert.
I want to go.
The bill, please.
Need a ride home?
No, walking will do me good.
We could walk together.
No, I want to be alone.
Thank you for dinner.
You're welcome.
I wanted to apologize for earlier.
I felt awkward.
Don't apologize. I understand.
It's hard sometimes to find the words
to say what you feel.
I know, Nathalie.
But I think I can answer.
I'm not attracted to you.
In fact, your manoeuvring
makes me uncomfortable.
I'm sure there'll never be anything
between us.
So...
Maybe I'm not capable
of being with someone anymore.
But if ever I consider it one day,
I know it won't be with you.
There. I wanted that to be said.
It's been said.
If I heard, you said it.
But it won't change
the trust we have in each other.
Of course not.
Come in.
Hello.
It's about case 114.
Case 114?
Yes.
The situation is a bit...
We'll see about 114 later.
Later, ok?
All right.
Seen Nathalie?
I don't know.
Call me.
- I forgot the code.
- What?
I forgot the code.
Shit!
I wonder what she's doing.
Is she reading a magazine?
Maybe she's eating grapes?
Is she opening her fridge?
Maybe she's drinking.
Is she lying down?
Is she thinking of me?
No, his colleague.
No. He looked bloated, I'd say.
Yes.
Come in.
Hello.
I'm here about 114.
We need to move ahead.
I'm listening.
Yes?
I wanted to know...
why you kissed me.
I kissed you?
Yes.
You stood up...
You walked over to me...
And...
And?
And I kissed you?
I don't know what came over me.
My mind must have been elsewhere
when you came in.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
Why sorry? It was wonderful.
Really?
Yes, it was...
Let's just forget it, ok.
Impossible.
That would be...
like forgetting the present.
Forgetting the present?
It's the first image I thought of.
Let's get back to work.
Case 114, is it?
I don't know what happened.
Let's forget it.
We work together
and my behaviour was inappropriate.
You sound like an American.
That's a bad sign.
I sound like the head
of the work group you belong to.
I don't know what came over me.
I was daydreaming
when you came in.
So let's forget it, please.
Let's look at the dresses.
This one's amazing.
I kissed someone.
What? Who?
I don't know.
You don't know who you kiss?
Well, yes. A colleague.
A Swedish guy in my work group.
Back up a second.
I want the details.
He's after you?
No, not at all.
I threw myself at him.
What? Are you kidding me?
No. He came into my office and...
I kissed him.
Who is this guy? Is he hot?
Is he single?
Yes, I think he's single.
How's it going? What's up?
Nothing.
I'm seeing Nathalie at 5.
And?
And...
It's 4:59.
I don't want to be early.
Ok...
I love your hair.
I could go on holiday in your hair.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
What's wrong, Markus?
Do you have a problem with that case?
Hello, have you seen Mr Lundell?
Who?
Markus Lundell. He works here.
No, I don't know who you mean.
- Do you know Markus Lundell?
- No.
Thank you.
Everything ok, Nathalie?
Have you seen Markus?
No. Shall I look for him?
No, it's all right.
I often come up here too
for a breather.
You'll catch a chill.
We'll be the same on that level then.
We'll both catch a chill.
I'm Swedish, remember.
This is like Africa for me.
You're funny.
- 114 won't make you laugh.
- True.
True...
But I'd rather return
to our sinister relations.
That's not easy, you know.
You kiss me, then nothing.
It's my fault
but I can't keep apologizing.
Let's have dinner.
Just once.
Afterwards, I won't bother you again.
I'll even skip dessert.
- A table for two?
- Please.
I made a booking. Thank you.
Is this ok?
Like it?
What?
What did I say?
Nothing.
It's just that it's a bit...
exotic.
- I think I know what I'll have.
- What?
Number 114!
114...
Shrimp fried noodles.
It could have been worse.
And you?
There are photos...
Is it good?
It's ok. And yours?
Very good, thank you.
Actually, it's foul.
Mine too. It's not very good.
We're exchanging ideas now...
You know,
I may not be very good company.
I'm not really used
to going out anymore.
And well...
it's odd eating with you.
I understand.
I think that every evening.
We don't know each other.
We're colleagues,
but I know nothing about you.
Why did you leave Sweden?
The real question is
why don't all Swede leave Sweden?
You speak good French.
I've been here 15 years now.
After university in Belgium.
Skol!
Cheers!
I'm not taking advantage of you.
All the beers here are lite.
Lite beer reminds me of my dad.
When I was 8, we went to the USA.
Every evening, he had a Bud.
I loved Pez candy.
You know, in the plastic figurines.
Yes.
Every evening,
he'd have his Bud
and I'd have my Pez candy.
It was nice.
Lychee? Nougat? Coffee?
- No thanks, no dessert.
- All right.
That was the deal?
Ok?
I'm ok.
Good morning.
Funny, us arriving at the same time.
Yes, it's funny.
Have a good day.
- See you at the meeting later.
- See you.
Evening out in Paris
God, not a play.
Romantic evening
A swingers' club!
Am I disturbing you?
Never...
No. Of course not.
Would you like to see a play with me tomorrow?
I'd be delighted to.
I love the theatre!
All right, I'll let you work now.
Shit!
Oops, sorry.
I'm glad you called me.
I call you all the time.
But you rarely ask me out.
I only suggested dinner.
And dinner's a fancy word for it.
There's not much.
So we'll drink my wine.
Come on then, tell me...
Your Swede.
You won't tell me?
There's nothing to tell.
He's just... a friend.
No doubt.
Why haven't you ever moved?
I don't know.
I mean, I know I need to move on
but I feel a sort of strange loyalty
to the past.
Like a weight
that it's impossible to shift.
Want to go out?
- I'll take one.
- 8 euros.
Thank you.
Keep the change.
Thank you.
Take care.
Shall we walk a little?
All right.
But I'm a bit tired.
I went out last night.
I'll call you a taxi.
No, I said it was all right.
I thought you meant
you wanted to go home.
You're quite a character.
I am?
I find this so weird.
What?
Well, I kiss you and...
here we are now...
and we always find things to say
without ever mentioning work.
I'm making a superhuman effort.
I like it when you laugh.
It makes me think I'm funny.
But you are.
You know...
this situation is tiring for me.
It's as if...
Liechtenstein were walking
with the USA.
Are you ok?
I must be careful.
Of what?
You need to ask that?
Just look...
Look around us.
Look at you.
I'm going to fall in love.
It's ridiculous.
They'll agree to a meeting
and it'll be decisive.
Yes, decisive.
We mustn't mess it up.
I think I can convince them
but they're unpredictable.
Don't forget
my birthday drinks later.
You'll be there?
We'll do it in accounts.
Put this in the green file, please.
I need you to sign this.
And here too.
Thanks. Perfect.
Markus...
Markus seemed strange.
Yes, we saw a play last night.
You and Markus?
Yes. It's no big deal.
But why?
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
Thank you, Chloe.
Come here.
Coming for a coffee?
Gossip? I love it.
Hello?
What are you playing at?
I want to stop seeing you.
It's self-protection.
How can you stop seeing me?
We work together!
We'll use the phone.
This is absurd!
Please respect my wishes.
You can't just stop seeing me.
I told you, it's self-protection.
You'll get neck ache.
Better than heartache.
Heartache...
I don't know what to say.
Personally...
I enjoyed those moments with you.
Have you seen that bouquet?
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You shouldn't have.
I'll get a drink.
What a beautiful bouquet.
That guy's really weird.
- He can't be with Nathalie.
- It's true!
They ignore each other.
You don't get it. They're pretending
not to know each other.
They know each other now.
What are those flowers?
I overdid it a bit.
What's behind this depressed Swede act?
Nothing...
You wear me out, Markus.
After three years,
I have two nice evenings with you
and you get worked up
because you might suffer.
You can always suffer.
It's absurd!
The absurd thing is
I have a gift for you too.
A gift?
In my office. Want to get it?
Yes.
I'll put some music on.
What is it?
A group from my youth.
I don't know them.
Only natural. No one does.
They were contemporaries of Abba.
Abba crushed them.
They weren't with it musically.
They didn't react and...
Not really disco music.
You used to listen to that?
Why did I put it on?
I'm crazy.
Going to give me that gift?
Yes.
Thank you.
Please open it at home.
All right.
Maybe we should go back.
What time is it?
How long were we away?
Sweetheart, why are you here?
It'll be all right.
Dear Markus,
Thank you for the Pez.
Let's have a drink later
but make our own ways there.
Lots of love...
Lots of love.
I'm sorry?
I'll have a glass of red wine.
Two glasses of red wine.
Whatever you have.
All right.
That looks fascinating.
Yes, I was reading an article
on a mozzarella network
broken up in the Paris suburbs.
It was used to supply pizza houses
in the local area.
What?
A mozzarella network... Pizzas...
I ordered for you.
Wonderful.
Know what I like?
No, but tell me.
Apart from the way you read
all about mozzarella networks,
you look the same every day.
It's reassuring.
It is?
May I buy you a drink?
Can't you see I have one?
You can't drink alone.
I'm with someone.
- This?
- Sir, please...
Stay out of it, pal.
I'm a great guy, you know.
Sir, do you mind?
He's riled now.
- Yes, I'm riled.
- Don't touch me.
I will if I want.
Fucking headcase!
It's ok, you're not hurt.
It must be an internal lesion.
I've had it.
What came over you?
He was disrespectful and...
It clearly couldn't be settled
diplomatically.
- Is this where it hurts?
- No.
- Here then?
- No.
Where then?
It's silly but as soon as you touch me
I don't hurt anywhere.
Ow!
And does this hurt, baby?
You called me "baby"?
Yes.
I know what I'm doing this time.
I'll leave you.
What are you doing?
Talking behind your back.
Very funny.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
I rarely see you.
I wondered how your group's doing.
Don't you read my reports?
I do. Of course.
Are you content,
on a human level?
Meaning?
Who's Markus Lundell?
I hear you often have dinner with him.
- Who told you?
- It's common knowledge.
What? Don't people have
anything better to do?!
I was just asking...
What the hell is it to do with you?
- Yes.
- Markus Lundell?
- Mr Delamain wants to see you.
- Me?
- Why?
- I don't know.
- Now.
- All right.
Go on, he's waiting.
Yes?
I'm too busy now.
- But...
- Come back later.
Ingrid, can you see
what this Lundell is doing?
But, sir, he just came to see you.
So what do I do?
Do I bring him back or not?
Good idea. Bring him back.
Yes?
- Markus Lundell?
- Yes.
- He wants to see you.
- Ok.
Thank you.
Yes.
I think you asked to see me?
You wanted to see me?
A krisproll?
No, thank you.
I left Sweden to avoid them.
Very funny.
A sense of humour...
You're funny, is that it?
Is that what?
Do you like it here? In our company?
Yes.
You get on with your colleagues?
I've been told you do remarkable work.
I wanted to congratulate you myself.
Really?
In fact...
Let's have a drink tonight.
I should spend more time
with our best employees.
- A drink?
- Yes, I'll see you later.
All right...
Goodbye.
And bravo again.
Thank you.
Well?
Did he fire you?
You're eating?
Yes, I waited for you but...
Want some?
No thanks. That's kind
but I'm not hungry.
How's it going?
I had a complicated morning.
I got annoyed with Charles.
- He spoke to me about you.
- And?
I shouldn't have got into such a state.
- You're smiling?
- Yes.
Why?
Getting annoyed means...
Ok, I get it.
My attitude necessarily
reveals something, is that it?
Let's take a walk.
As for me,
I sense a surge in popularity.
Really?
Yes. People take an interest in me,
come to see me...
Is intranet working?
Got an eraser?
Still on 114?
It's crazy about that Swede,
dying before his trilogy was a hit.
They imagine an affair...
What affair?
Our affair.
There is no affair.
There can't be one.
I need us to stop talking.
Let's just move on.
- Where to?
- The end of the park.
I meant figuratively.
I realize that.
I was making a joke.
You don't have a monopoly.
No, that's true.
In fact, you won't like this.
What?
The boss wants to have
a drink with me tonight.
I hope you said no.
It's hard saying no to your boss.
You know she likes you?
I knew this would be about her.
We went out a couple of times,
that's all.
You saw a play?
- Yes.
- There you go.
You don't see a play
if there's nothing going on.
Plays are for couples.
Why live through one otherwise?
Charles is seeing Markus tonight.
Markus? Your Swede?
Yes.
Isn't he in your group?
Charles wanted to see him.
He's just jealous.
He's checking out the enemy.
A desperate man's tactics.
Can you pass me that plate?
Here.
Your tall blond
must have come as a shock to him.
When do I get to meet him?
Scared I'll steal him from you?
Yeah, that must be it.
So where are you at?
Nowhere. I don't know.
It's dumb, I'm missing him tonight.
Tell him to come over.
He can dump that psychopath,
then join us.
We'll see.
He hasn't called yet.
This evening did me good.
Meeting someone like you...
You're a decent guy.
But I can't imagine Nathalie...
I'm not with her.
But you're her type.
I know. I can tell.
You're the tactful type.
There are other women...
Nathalie is one of those women
who cancels out all others.
Nathalie is Yoko Ono.
The kind to wreck the world's top group.
That's what Natalie is.
Yes.
I know.
So you admit it now.
I admit what?
That you love her.
Yes.
I love her.
Talk to me about your love.
What do you love about her?
She allows me to be
the best possible version of myself.
That's beautiful.
You're a poet.
A fucking poet...
On top of it,
he's a fucking poet, this bastard!
Let's go.
Don't touch me!
It's ok.
Goodbye. Thank you.
We'll get a taxi.
There's a taxi stand.
- Where?
- At the corner.
I feel so damn rough.
You'll be fine tomorrow.
You're tired.
You're putting me in a cab
and going to meet her?
Not at all.
Just look how you're dressed.
Honestly...
Thanks for the drinks.
And he's polite too!
- Yes?
- Good evening.
We're too noisy?
No... I don't know.
I'm a friend of Nathalie's.
You're Markus?
Yes, that's me. And you're Sophie?
Yes.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
You can put your things there...
- Well, your bag.
- Thank you.
You're here.
So? How did it go?
It was complicated. I'll explain.
Want a drink?
I think I've had enough.
But we can stay.
Yes, of course.
We're all friends here.
Come on in.
You can have a drink
or maybe not.
Make yourself at home.
Our place is your place!
This is Markus.
Good evening.
Pierre. Welcome.
Good evening.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Something to drink?
No, thank you.
- There's plenty here.
- That's kind, but no.
They've won a contract.
Our architecture firm.
We've signed for a tower in Sao Paulo.
Congratulations.
It's a beautiful city.
You know it?
No, but that's how I imagine it.
Sao Paulo... The name sounds good.
Right...
It's exotic.
Excellent.
So what do you do?
I work with Nathalie.
She's my boss.
We're in a work group.
Hold on, you run it.
You could move up higher in the firm.
You could hope for much better.
- Any champagne left?
- Yes.
Where's the bathroom, please?
Down the hall on the right.
It's ok. It was terrible wine.
- It was crap.
- It was a great Bordeaux!
I feel a bit tired. Shall we go?
Ashamed of me?
Why do you say that?
- I felt some unease.
- It wasn't unease.
It's just that...
They've never seen me with someone.
It doesn't matter.
People prefer you to be alone.
You don't understand.
Look at how everyone's getting
so frantic around us.
What a major affair!
Well, affair...
Like you said, there's no affair.
Why am I even here?
Don't...
People take advantage
because I'm too kind
but I can say what I think too.
I'm sick of it.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Markus.
Come on.
Ok?
- Do you like it?
- Delicious.
Just like coffee.
Sit down.
Melba toast?
Please.
Buttered?
Please.
- Here.
- Thanks.
You're good.
I break it every time.
Actually, this is an old pack.
Past the use-by date.
I'm touched
you kept it so long for me.
- Here.
- Thanks.
- Why don't we stay here today?
- No.
I have to see Charles.
He's got a nerve.
You should just forget it.
No, we can't just ignore this.
He's in love.
It's hard not being loved back.
I'm just saying that.
I guess it is.
It's never happened to me.
No, enough is enough.
I want to be left in peace.
Or torture him with Melba toast.
I'm sorry. Is it that bad?
No, it's ok.
When was the use-by date?
You could knock!
Take that as a knock!
I could fire you.
And I could sue you for harassment!
What's wrong with you?
I've always respected your life.
Sure.
I don't understand.
What were you up to with Markus?
We had dinner
so I could get to know him
and find what you see
in such an ugly, insignificant guy.
Leave him alone, ok.
Any minute now, your darling Markus
will get a great offer.
Trouble is, the job's in Stockholm.
But, with the pay rise,
he won't hesitate long.
You're pathetic.
I could easily resign to follow him.
You can't do that! I forbid it!
You can't do that to Francois either!
There you are.
I've prepared the meeting for you.
What meeting?
The one you've spent three months
working on.
I don't know what's going on.
I'm sorry.
Mrs Kerr will be here soon.
She must be stuck in traffic.
Let's have something to drink
while we wait.
The boss will murder me
because of you!
You don't know where she is?
No, I don't. So stop asking me!
A few more minutes...
See you soon.
Where are we going?
I grew up around here.
Francois too.
We met in Paris
but we could have easily met here.
When he died,
I thought he'd want to be buried here.
There he is.
He's been there so long already.
She probably can't hear.
I'll knock on the window.
What a lovely surprise!
Give me a kiss.
- I'll get you wet.
- Never mind.
My little darling...
My little sweetheart...
Give me a kiss.
Gran, this is Markus.
- Hello, Markus.
- Hello, ma'am.
No, call me Madeleine.
I used to know a Markus.
No, not Markus, Paulus.
Don't just stand there,
come in and get changed.
We don't have any clothes.
You can take one of my dresses.
For Markus,
there are Grandpa's clothes.
- In the wardrobe upstairs.
- All right.
You remember?
Yes, we'll find them.
Off you go.
I'm so happy to see you.
Will soup do?
Soup is perfect.
Does Markus like it?
He loves soup.
- I like Markus.
- You do?
Yes. He's a good person.
You saw him for 30 seconds.
I can tell.
There you are.
That's perfect.
Let's eat.
It's delicious.
Really? Would you like some more?
No, thank you.
You can stay as long as you like.
Thank you.
The light never works on the stairs.
You're awake?
Did you sleep well?
And you?
I love going out
into the garden in the morning.
Isn't this heaven?
We used to hide behind this tree
when we played hide-and-seek.
Want to play?
- At hide-and-seek?
- Yes.
- Now?
- You count and I'll hide.
All right.
1... 2... 3... 4...
I walk through Nathalie's
different ages.
She probably hid behind this tree
when she was six.
As a teenager,
she rejected the old games
and roamed past the roses sulking.
As a young woman
she sat dreamily on this bench.
Francois chased her
and they loved each other.
She found herself alone.
He'd never be there again.
Her grandmother couldn't do a thing
to comfort her.
By walking here, I trample her grief.
And this spot,
at the heart of these Nathalies,
is where I'm going to hide.
