Love and suffering are
two sides of the same coin
With love, we will talk about love
With love, we will discuss love problems
With love, we will meet
for a couple of hours
ln ''Me, the Stars and your love''
Dear listeners, today's episode
deals with love and solitude
We frequently feel lonely and
we frequently feel pain and sadness
And we frequently need someone
to love and share our love
You're live with Usama Munir
Love is a wonderful feeling
that teases the human hearts
whereas loneliness is a pain
felt by every person looking for love
Sometimes, a guy might feel
that no girl would ever love him
That's me
He would feel more and more
Ionely because he never loved a girl
- That's also me
- Those people live in misery
That's enough
- In sorrow
- That's enough
- In desolation
- That's enough
- In loneliness
- That's enough Usama, enough
Sadness is loneliness but love
gives the lovers real happiness
Let's go back to receiving your calls
- Hello
- Hello
l guess that's Riham's voice
- How are you doing Riham?
- Hello Usama, how are you?
l recognized you when
you cleared your throat
Riham, you were listening to us
since the beginning of the episode?
lndeed and l can repeat
everything you said if you like
What do you think
of this episode's subject?
l think that every person
has a second half
Give me a kiss before
getting into the house
We're receiving lots
of SMS and plenty of calls
But let's go back again
Oh yeah, l forgot to tell
you something important
Tell him you're gonna spend
the night here but go easy on him

lmad
We're gonna give you the
name of a person and its birth date
You'll get into the
company's personal computer
and bring us some
simple data about him
His address, his residence place
it's a piece of cake, okay?
So you want me
to reveal the customers' data?
- Exactly
- What? Indeed l can't
that's beyond my iurisdiction
and against my principles and morals
We don't want you to act against
your principle, morals and jurisdictions
- It's very simple, this girl...
- What? She's a girl not a guy
That's impossible, impossible Imad
This girl ripped him off
a 9 carat diamond ring
And changed her address
We couldn't find her house
and address, nor could the cops
You're the only one who can help us
l cannot do it Imad
it's impossible, impossible

l would never try to get
information about a girl, l am sorry
We have nothing more

all the lines of the world, excuse me

good evening, good evening
- May l take the stand?
- Sure, go ahead
- Excuse me
- Go ahead
What's wrong with him?
Tell us Omar about your architecture
diploma and the life in the USA
Fine, fine, fine
Okay
ln fact, l'm honored
as one of the brilliant students
to stand right here today
and be a good example for you
Actually, it's clear that
l studied architecture in the USA
lt's clear that's a
unanimous agreement
Let's make it clear that l'm not
part of this unanimous agreement
l wanted to say that
when l was in the USA
One day, as l was walking by the US Nile
that is located in the US highway
l was moved by a certain attitude...
Holy shit... l was moved
Before l talk about this
attitude, let's speak frankly
Why don't we speak frankly?
There comes the attitude
lt's beautiful, transparent
- Hello Gamila
- How are you doing?
- l'm so happy, l'm thrilled
- l know no one
l'm so happy
- Who's that?
- It's Omar Abu el-Wafa, an architect
Here in this school, the school of...
in this school from which
l graduated, in which l studied hard
The school of... the school of
the international future of the past
The school is still the same
it hasn't changed a bit, right?
The balloons are great
- Omar
- Yeah
- Come here
- Yeah, you're calling me?
Good evening
- Don't you remember Sarah and Gamila?
- Not quite, we were kids back then
- No, l cannot remember them
- And l didn't remember you in the first place
Let's go Gamila
- l can remember, why is she in such haste?
- Her dress is magnificent
Red has always
been her favorite color
What's this? fourth in the third grade?
Let's beat it coz the real
Omar has just arrived
What? Omar el-Hariri is here?
l wanna take a picture with him
l said that the real Omar is here
- Let's beat it
- Okay
- When the real Omar arrives, give him this
- Go away
We're still on a date, right?
lt's been 2 hours that
we're watching some queer stuff
For God's sake, why are
those people selling eggs here?
Most importantly, when they
said they will arrive on the phone?
- They didn't say when nor where?
- What?
They said they're coming here
- What time is it?
- l don't have a watch
See? They're very late
There they are Mu'taz
they're here, there she is
Do you think this red color
is enough or should l add a little bit more?
- No, it's fine
- Great
- You sure know what you're gonna do
- No
Look, l want you to show
a great self-confidence
Then, shake hands with
her very gently... very gently
l want you to charm her with your words
l want you to stumble her off
Man, you were gonna do that?
You meant that l should stumble her
with the tennis racket not with my leg
What? What?
lf l had told you, make her love you
to death, you would have buried her?
What can l do?
l am totally inexperienced
Look, l have nothing whatsoever
to do with this, is that clear?
Wezza
lf you yelled at me again
l'm gonna leave you here and go
Wezza, Wezza
- Get ready, they're coming this way
- Yeah, l can see them on the tip of my nose
Throw your mobile as if it fell on the floor
Fine, hold these sunglasses for me
- As if, as if
- Fine, like a coincidence
- Why didn't you say so?
- As soon as she sees you, she'll call you
And if she doesn't? Should l call her?
- Okay, fine
- Excuse me Mr.
- Should l answer or be heedless of her?
- Excuse me Mr.
- Answer her but play the cocky
- Fine
- What?
- You dropped your sunglasses
What about my mobile? Didn't
you notice it or you have poor sight
What's this? It's Omar
how are you doing Omar?
What's this? Weren't you...?
We were together in that gathering place
What a nice coincidence
what a nice coincidence
- What do you say we play together?
- No, we don't want to delay them
Play as you like, we don't want to delay
you, the whole garden is at your service
- Nice meeting you
- Bye
- What the hell? They left, they left
- You just told them to leave
- What will you do now?
- You're asking me?
Bring the mobile, bring the mobile
- What the hell?
- What?
- It needs recharging
- Move, move
- Omar sounds very familiar
- No kidding, that's very normal
- We used to go to the same school
- No, l don't remember him from school
l saw him as a grown-up man
Hit the ball towards her
and go there to hit it again
Fine
- l should step on you neck, man
- What?
This is not billiard
hit the ball while standing
- While standing?
- Yes
How the hell would l know?
Why don't you explain it quietly
Get back a bit
l'm terribly sorry
l didn't mean to, l'm sorry
- Did it hurt?
- Yes indeed it hurts
- Thank God
- What?
Thank God there
were no complications
You've been playing
golf for a long time?
l've been playing since the morning
lt's too far, hold on a second
Iet me fetch it for you
- Fetch what? We're going that way
- But that's a very long way to go
Hold on a second, hey lad
Could you please take us to that ball?
He stopped, let's go, l've got
some change, don't you worry
- It's Mu'taz Ping Pong
- Ping Pong? What does it mean?
- Don't you ask me? And don't be upset
- Take your hand off
- Don't talk to me like this again
- Something like that
- Let's go Sarah, l'm hungry
- Why?
- Go on
- Okay, bye
- Bye
- Bye
- l'll call you
- Bye
Tell me the good news
what have you done?
- This is the happiest day of my life
- What do you mean?
- Everything is fine?
- What a silly question
lndeed, everything is fine
- You took her phone number?
- Indeed not coz l have it
- You're a fool or what?
- She doesn't know you have it
You should have taken it to call her
Fine, you told her you
like her very much?
- No
- Fine
- You agreed on a second date?
- No, nothing like that
- You didn't agree on anything?
- Not at all? No, l did none of that
- Oh man
- It's the happiest day of my life
Oh man
Why do you blame me?
Why do you blame me? If only
you've seen her beautiful numbers
What?
What could happen?
l will tell, Sarah, my name is
Tarek el-Wakil not Omar Abu el-Wafa
My name is Tarek el-Wakil
not Omar Abu el-Wafa
l think we should put off
this decision a little bit?
- Wezza
- What? You son of a bitch
This is the decision l'm waiting for
Malaki Giza, how l love you
- Good morning, Miss architect
- Good morning
- Do you need anything else?
- No, you go on, Mr. Ibrahim
- l'll follow you
- Alright
- Good morning
- Omar
- l looked for you everywhere
- Why is that?
- Ain't this your plate number?
- Yes, what is this?
You dropped it
yesterday on the golf course
And l called this number
all night long, but it was busy
lt seems you stopped
in front of a long road sign
- Thank you
- You're welcome
- How did you get my address?
- From the traffic station
l went there, showed them the plate, paid
the fines, brought the address and here l am
l don't know what took me so long
What's this?
You have a sleeping (= flat) tire
- Quiet, we don't want to wake it up
- l can't believe it
- It's no big deal, l have a tire pump
- What?
You're gonna use the tire pump
and l'm here, that's impossible
What's this? You have another
flat tire there it is, l swear
Two flat tires at the same day? You
might find your tire pump gone as well
You're happy or what?
l'm gonna be late
My car is at your service
Why are you looking upstairs?
It's not parked on the tree
There it is, that's my car
that beautiful thing is my car
Come, l can give you a lift
You might find it a bit used but
l brought some socks to cover her
Come on in, come on in
Okay, close your nostrils
before l start the car
Let's take the shoes off
take the shoes off
Don't be surprised, when l take my
shoes off and drive bare foot, l go quicker
Close your nostrils
l'm gonna start the car
Stop
- Car and driving licenses
- Take
- Your licenses have expired too
- Due to too much driving sir
- Too much driving? Yeah
- It's okay
- You have a fire extinguisher?
- Yes indeed
- l wouldn't drive without it
- Show it to me
There you go
You're kidding me?
l said fire extinguisher
Okay, a fire extinguisher
fine, l misunderstood
There it is, but l have to keep it
bent or else it will hit the ceiling
- What exactly is the problem sir?
- Can't you see the problem?
- Security and soundness
- Security and foulness?
You're taking the licenses
because of foulness?
- l can clean it
- Clean it?
When your car burns down
you can extinguish it with the ashtray
- Yes sir
- Move it
Yes sir, yes sir
For god's sake, excuse me everybody
no smoking inside the theater
- Why? does the theater have chest pains?
- What took you so long?
- l'll tell you later
- How are you doing?
What are you doing here?
How are you doing Omar?
- Fine, thank you
- Come on in, just a second
What a prestigious place
Move the painting to the
right, Gamal, a bit more
Sarah, Sarah, the sound please
The band wants to rehearse
Yeah, keep it like this
- May l say something?
- Hold on a second
l had a dream about you
- Me too
- l dreamt about you before meeting you
Or maybe because l was
Ionging to see you, l don't know
What did you dream about?
ln my dream, you were sleeping with
you hair hanging down on the pillow
And that's it
Close your eyes
That's how you looked like
just like an angel
- There is a missing number
- What?
Don't get startled, l iust fixed it quickly
coz l lost the screws when
l was taking it off the last time
- What?
- Why do you inquire about everything?
ls it an investigation? Forget about it
Why don't you come wash
your hands in my workshop
lf only, l'd like to
There you go
Don't look backwards
you should always look forward
By the way, your can is very elegant
were it black, it would have been outstanding
- Black? No, l hate that color
- Me too
Although l know that
black is a majestic color
it could make the
painting look ravishing
- The power is back on
- Who said it was off?
- Just kidding
- Wash your hand
Because it's black, right?
- Where is the bathtub?
- To your left
- Would you like a cup of Nescafé?
- But not black
l tried hard to change
my laugh but l couldn't
Change it? Like add
some vibrations to it?
lmagine someone
with a vibrated laugh
Act naturally
l dreamt about you too
Omar, Omar
- Who knocked at the towel?
- Me
What did you say when
l was using the towel?
l dreamt about you too
Could you please put my eyeglasses on
coz l wanna hear it better?
When l told you l dreamt
about you, you said me too
No need to do that, the
Nescafe is more than enough
You really dreamt about me?
What did you dream about?
Sarah?
- It seems that daddy's home
- What?
- What's wrong with you?
- Run away, run away
- Where to?
- You said your daddy's back home
- Yeah he is
- How can l get away?
- Why would you get away? Stay here
- How can l stay? Your dad came home
- It's no big deal
- You'll tell him l'm your brother?
You're here?
- Calm down, what's wrong with you?
- How the hell can l calm down?
- Hi Sarah
- Hi daddy
Let me introduce you to the
engineer Omar Abu el-Wafa
This is my father
Dr. Muhammad el-Mahdi
This towel is not mine
- l'm a veterinarian
- The best of them all
Tell me something Omar, what kind
of engineering you specialized in?
Veterinary, l'm an architect
- Really? You're an architect?
- Yes
l will be needing you
when we move to the ranch
- Okay?
- Yes alright
Excellent, see you later alligator
- Bye
- Bye daddy
- He left
- Yeah
- It's that simple?
- Yeah
l told him that the towel is not mine
l told you not to worry
dad is open-minded
l'm gonna spend the night here
Man, the car is right in front of me
160 thousand or 170 thousand
l'll give it a try then l can fix a price
Fine man, goodbye
What were you saying?
l was saying that l might go to
Tunisia for a week, to work there
- And l'll be back soon
- Tunisia?
Yes Tunisia, don't you like it?
Tunisia is a nice country
No, but you already told me
you need a couple of days
and now you're going
to Tunisia for a week
Hopefully, l won't stay for long
- What's this?
- What?
- Where's your moustache, man?
- It didn't wanna come with me
- Come with me
- Where to?
We'll try this car and
continue our little chat
To the right, to the right
To the left, to the left
How much does the
owner wants for this car?
160 thousand
After this ride, you might take it for
20 pounds, it would be a great price
Okay man, have a safe trip to Tunisia
- Where is this ranch?
- Nearby, in Fayyum
Sarah, would you invite Mu'taz
to come with us to the ranch?
He's dying to come
but l don't think he'll come
No, no, l'm sure he'll come
You...
Mr. Fady, when did you
come to Tunisia?
l'll call you
Welcome here, take care
- Right here
- Yeah
By the way Ma'am
l found a flat right next to you
Hopefully, Sarah can
design it the way she likes
- What took Omar so long, Mu'taz?
- Traffic jam
Why don't you eat, Mr. architect?
- l was iust playing with him
- It's obvious that you're scared of dogs
- Why? It's a very nice dog
- l haven't seen him before
lt's Dr. Adham, Mr. Omar
he's an architect
- Nice to meet you
- Nice to meet you
- What is your specialization, doctor?
- Gynecology and obstetrics
- Both of them? Or one of them
- Both are the same division
Why don't you show me
the rose you planted, honey?
- Okay honey
- Okay
- Why don't we go for a walk?
- What?
- All together
- Okay
- Why don't you show me your ranch?
- Fine, come on
Go on
He's very nice, a man's
known by the company he keeps
Have a nice chat with him
- It's a nice ring tone
- l'll send it to you
- Can you see this?
- The white and black one?
- Yeah, she's named after me
- No kidding
- Her name is Sarah Muhammad el-Mahdi?
- l'll go get it for you
- Fine
- You'll receive the ring tone
- Excuse me?
- Beware
Don't you worry
You iust received it
- What? What is it?
- Nothing
- What's wrong?
- Nothing
What's wrong?
- Omar, Omar, what's wrong?
- l'm a bit dizzy
Don't you worry
l'm scared of heights
- l have a phobia
- Phobia?
Don't you worry, it's not contagious
- Omar, Sarah, come out
- What's this?
- Dad's calling us, let's go down
- Never mind him
Come here Omar, l wanna show
you this nice empty piece of land
That could be exploited
in many different ways
But l'd like to build a windmill
to generate power for the ranch
- It's a wonderful idea
- Would you draw it, architect?
That's a very bad idea
for me to draw it
lt's a windmill, any
miller can build it, sir
Just like a building
any builder can make it
- It doesn't require an architect
- How is that?
To each its own specialization
- When l decide to build, l need a sketch
- Indeed
- And to make a sketch, l need an architect
- Indeed
and when we need an architect
there's one person required
- Who is it?
- Omar
- Red
- What's red?
The windmill, we can make a long
red windmill just like the nations' league
- Omar
- What?
- Let's go to the pen
- Fine, you can go to the pen
Does your pen move?
He's not coming with us to the
pen or he'll be there waiting for us?
Just go
My problem is that l have no problem
at all, not the slightest problem
l have a feeling that each person
should have some worries
that keep him awake at night
- l seem to be facing an imminent problem
- It's a serious problem
ls that so? You really should
have studied architecture
Even if l studied veterinary medicine, l can
see in your eyes what you refuse to admit
- Call them to see where they are
- Who? Your eyes?
Yeah Wezza, we're in the pen
- In the pen?
- No, don't get me wrong
- She obviously loves pens by the way
- Speak up, l cannot hear you
- l'm not holding the mobile in my hand
- Then what are you holding?
- You don't wanna know
- Go on, tell her you love
Open discussions, charm her
What the hell are you
doing all this time?
- l'm making tea with milk
- Tell her you love her
What? You want me to tell
her now that l love her?
l cannot hear you
You want me to tell her
now that l love her?
This is the cow l love most, since l arrived
l felt that l'm gonna love her
There's a cow on your mouth, l mean there
is... what is it called? Just wipe your mouth
l'll be down
l love her so much
l adore this place, isn't it gorgeous?
You know something? When
l'm feeling down in the dumps, l come here
- Who's Adham?
- My cousin
- Is this Adham...
- Why are you keeping him in mind?
Forget him
Go on Sarah, get off and go with your
father coz l don't want him to drive alone
And l'll go with Adham
coz l'm going to your auntie's
Okay
Should your mother pay
a visit to your auntie today?
- Yeah she should
- Fine, okay, let her sleep over too
She's so rude
What's this? Sarah
Sarah, what about the dog?
Doesn't he wanna
pay a visit to auntie?
- Why don't you take her home with you?
- But...
Sarah, Sarah, iust wait a bit
Ragab, take these
things upstairs please
You're coming with me
or you'll go straight to the workshop?
No, l'll wait for Omar
l don't know what took him so long
Okay, l'll get up then
He's a nice dog
What's this? Why are
you in such a mess?
l turned the volume up a bit
Get inside
Leave him, leave him
l can take a cab, no problem
Get down, get down
Get down? She's a female
She's very strong that
l thought she was a strong male
Besides, she hates l-shirts
Okay then, goodbye
- Sarah, may l ask you something?
- What?
- Who's Adham?
- First, l've heard this question a lot
Adham is my cousin, mom
wants me to marry him
and l would never marry
someone l don't love
Doesn't he stand a chance?
Coz l found him a nice and sweet guy
- Good night Omar
- Good night?
No, l'll wait until you get
upstairs and wave for me
- Fine, okay, bye
- Bye, bye
l forgot to ask her about Adham
Omar?
l thought you forgot, good morning
So what?
Say hello, please say hello
Say hello, please don't push the ''no'' button
There are plenty of beautiful girls but they

And the best battery
Say hello, please say hello
Say hello, please
don't push the ''no'' button
Say hello, hello, hello
Say hello, please don't push the ''no'' button
Put it on silent
Hello, hello, answer, hang up
Ouch, you hung up on me
You hung up on me, it hurts
Your love stole my life
and deleted me ofFthe world
Before you, l was living
alone with nobody to care
I've been su_ering for years
and waiting impatiently
I've been su_ering for years
and waiting impatiently
You're my first real love
Say hello, please say hello
Say hello, please don't push the ''no'' button

You lost me inside the network
please answer my call
Answer, hang up, cancel, hang up
Hello
How nice, Tarek is wearing
a suit with my tie and shirt
Just temporarily
Besides, you're wearing my
dressing gown and l didn't object
- See you later
- Listen
Where are you going
so immaculately dressed?
l'm going to see Sarah and
l'll confess everything to her
l'll tell her and she will
indeed appreciate my love
and will consider these couple of lies
a passing emergent circumstance
Wish me luck
- Listen
- What?
- Why don't you wait a bit?
- l said l'm going, man
- Just give me 56 pounds
- How much?
56 pounds
- What's this?
- No
- What?
- Don't you throw it away
lf you want to throw it
do it in my absence
- Goodbye, wish me luck
- God be with you
No
The last thing l expected
was to discover you're lying
And you know very
well how l abhor lying
- You? You Ibrahim?
- Liar
- l swear Miss, my wife was...
- Your wife told me she wasn't even pregnant
You may leave now Ibrahim
and never come back again
Leave, leave, you liar
- You wanted to tell me something Omar?
- l never wanted to say anything
l iust wanted to ask you something
You won't let Ibrahim
get back to work with you?
- Impossible, he's a liar
- Never? Never?
Look, forget about him and tell me
what's with this elegant suit?
Was l so badly dressed before or what?
Look Sarah, l can't
imagine my life without suits
But you know something
casual wear suits you better
By the way, l cannot imagine
my life without casual wear
l've never ever worn a suit
lbrahim won't be back?
You know that the man in this painting
Iooks very much like your father
When a person starts drawing
he would have something in mind
And when he finishes the painting
he find it totally different
Because l think that sometimes
we draw with the soul not the mind
Believe me, it's something
that happens frequently with me
l was once drawing
the plans of Elwi bridge
When l finished the
drawing, l took a look
And found the drawing
of a friend of mine
- What?
- Yeah, it's a frequent occurrence
But l understood what happened, it's
because my friend's name was Mahmud Elwi
Thus, the similarity
between him and Elwi bridge
Drawing is a great art
and so it happens
Madiha, call me
Tarek el-Wakil right away
Okay Mr. Fady
- Hello, yes
- Hello
- It's my phone
- Ain't this the phone of Mr.
Yeah, it is... there you go
l didn't add any sugar
mine is the big one, okay?
- Don't be greedy
- Fine
- Hello
- My pal Tarek
Yes man
lf you cannot work this out
- Just tell me to find someone else
- Someone else? No
We made a deal, iust
give you exactly 2 days
Okay, okay, see you
This is not the right time for you at all
- Who was this?
- A friend of mine who needed a favor
l wanna tell you something
real important about Omar
She's surely gonna say she loves me
That's not the time
How is our company's
active employee doing?
Fine sir, thank you
Haven't you sold another 1 OO lines?
You think l conceive them, sir? l hope so
Gamila, it was the voice of a girl
When l asked him about it
he said it was his friend
That's pretty bizarre
Look, do you know his address?
l don't know, how
about we send him Leila?
You know her, she's
gonna expose him
The most important element
about a salesman is his tongue
lndeed, that's the most
important thing for every person
- But it shouldn't be very heavy
- Yeah, it shouldn't be very heavy
- That would bring the salesman down
- Indeed sir
- Tarek
- It's enough
- l thought you left, l was talking to Mursy
- Mursy
Yes... go on, dear Lord
Well, goodbye Gamila
Holy cow, l iust bought you
Iast year, how come it's empty now
Goodbye Sarah, l iust
arrived in front of his building
Get dressed, we should get going
lt's still too early, l'll go
check if the socks are dry
You look like Um Sayyid
after taking her bath
l hope the socks are dry
lt's still wet from the inside
Get me anything to eat
this stuff is making me starve
You left the freezer's
light on since yesterday?
We iust have some beans
Fix me a bean sandwich
without tomato sauce
Did you hear me?
Without tomato sauce
Tomato, we don't
have any tomato sauce
You want one without
sesame oil sauce?
Okay, okay, l'm coming
A real Ping Pong
Excuse me, isn't
this the building 67?
What if it's 68 or 69? It's my birthday
Iet's all celebrate together
- Is this the flat of Mr. Biyasti?
- Yes
- You're Hasim Biyasti?
- Indeed
They don't fit together
but we can manage
- Man, why didn't you say so?
- Fine, why don't you get in?
- Why don't you get out?
- Sure thing
Stop playing, stop playing
Listen, help me, Fady's here
- Who's Fady?
- The one l told you about
- Who did you tell me about?
- For god's sake, concentrate
Fady is the guy over there
l want you to delay him
- You want me to kill him?
- What?
lf he asked about me, tell him
l'm on a 1 3 to 1 5 years vacation
- Okay, fine
- Go on, quickly
Delay him, don't kill him
- Bruce Willis?
- No, l'm Fady Atawya
ls Mr. Tarek el-Wakil here?
- He's not here?
- No
- Where is he?
- On a vacation
- Vacation?
- Yeah
- Vacation?
- Yes, vacation
Hey sir, you were asking
for Tarek el-Wakil, right?
- Yes
- As soon as you arrived, he vanished
- What do you mean?
- He took off
He took off? So he's not on
vacation as little missy just told me
What vacation? As soon as you entered
he turned pale and disappeared
lt seems to me you're
on very good terms with him
He's my dearest pal
- Fine then, Mr.
- Yehya
Yehya, this is my business card, if you
really care for him, drop by me at any time
- Fine
- Fine, man
l don't know why she's
not answering my calls
She must have found out something
She must have found out something
l'm absolutely sure
What?
l've been working on
this plan for 2 months
She's not answering my calls
she's not answering my calls, Mu'taz
l'm so upset, so terribly
upset, absolutely upset
- Hey man
- What? What should l do?
- Let go of me
- Don't break anything
l won't, let go of me
Fady paid me a visit in the company
and she's not answering my calls
So she certainly
found out something, Mu'taz
- l'm terribly upset
- Hey man
Maybe she doesn't know
a thing and is just having attitude
- Go to her house as l advised you
- There you go sir
- Thank you Mr. Hussein
- You're welcome sir
Listen, you got the
windmill drawings ready?
- Yeah, they're ready since yesterday
- l want you to explain them to me
So that l know what to say to the man
Where is the weed you told me about?
Mu'taz, where is the weed?
lt's iust my friend, it's no big deal
Show some respect
towards respected people
When you need something
like that, say cappuccino
- What?
- Cappuccino
- With a C?
- Yes
- Why didn't you say so?
- l just did
Go and sit there
Where is the cappuccino?
See? l said it
- When will you leave?
- In 1 O minutes
l was absolutely sure l'll find you here
See what l got you? Some nice weed
- Who's there Uweiss?
- It's the dog sir
The dog?
Welcome Mr. Architect
how are you doing?
- Hello doctor, how are you doing?
- Come on in
- Is Sarah here?
- Yeah but she's asleep
l didn't come to see her
l came to show you the drawing
- Well done, come on in
- Okay
How can a dog ring the bell?
Look straight in front of you
Dear Lord
You shouldn't get him
used to such movies
l'm starting to get iealous
you're closer to him than us
One should be humiliated to be happy
you know what l mean? l just love dogs
Fine champ, show me the drawing
you said you brought me today
- Sir, is Sarah still asleep?
- Yes dear, Sarah is still asleep
- Shall we?
- Okay
As soon as l called you, you came up
The next time, you'll sniff it
That was nothing, l'll make you wander
the streets longing for a sniff, you dog
Shut your mouth
- Dear Lord, it's really very nice
- You're right
- Well done, Omar
- No, l drew it myself
- Yes, l said well done Omar
- Oh yes, see how great it is?
- Did you see the blades?
- What blades?
The windmill blades
they're producing some air
Beware, you'll get your finger cut
That's at night, if we saw it
in the morning, it'll be very different
- Great, great Omar
- Thank you doctor
- Is Sarah still asleep?
- Yes, l already told you she's asleep
She usually sleeps
all Thursdays and Fridays
This one is great
- Someone has coded the data
- So they're coded?
You brought me the two wigs?
- How can l forget?
- How nice
lt's a nice long table doc
- Why don't finish your meat plate?
- l cannot, l'm full
l ate as if l haven't eaten in 3 hours
Thank you doc, your food is very light
lt was very nice of you, soup and
stuffed vegetables, l'm really speechless
Excuse me, l have to get the dog
vaccination shots out of the fridge
- Go on doctor
- Excuse me, l'll check on Sarah
Go on Ma'am, yes that's great, you're
gonna leave me all alone at this long table?
ln fact, l gathered you to...
l don't know what to say
- Come on Omar
- What? l'm vaccinated
l mean it's too late, it's time to sleep
- But l don't sleep now doctor
- We want to sleep
So you want to leave?
Oh, you mean that l should get going
Excuse me, but this friendly
environment moved me so
lndeed, go ahead doctor
- l iust wanted to ask you something
- What?
When Sarah's mother went
to wake her up, she didn't come back
Could there be a hole in
the room or something like that?
Let's check on them at your
neighbors', in the floor below
- She might be dead and you're not telling me
- Go ahead Omar
- You're most welcome
- Thank you
When Sarah wakes up and regains
consciousness from her monthly sleep
Tell her l passed by
and asked about her
- Fine, okay
- Goodbye
- Goodbye
- Goodbye
l don't understand why is Sarah
mad at him, Tarek is a very nice guy
You forgot the door open
beware of thieves
- Sarah
- Go on
- Sarah
- Go on
He's very nice and decisive
ln brief, Tarek coded all these data
And he's the only one
who can enter them
But don't you worry sir
we can manage as well
l had a feeling he's lying to me
This is not the right time for you, Fady
- What the hell, man?
- What is it man?
Why aren't you answering my calls?
You called me, l iust
put my phone on silent
- Thank God, the ring tone is back on
- Fine, come here
- Why?
- Come here
Alright, where do you want us to go?
To Deius
You're not gonna park the car?
No, it would be iust like
a bump on the road
- Gugu
- Mu'taz, how are you doing?
- Happy birthday, you gorgeous girl
- Thanks a lot
- You shouldn't have bothered
- l indeed should have
- Come on in, l'll be with you in a while
- Fine, don't be late
No, l won't
- Hi
- Hi, how are you doing Mu'taz?
- So, you couldn't find anything about her?
- Maybe, she left Egypt
So bad
Sometimes, we are forced
to lie in order to save ourselves
And sometimes, we are forced
to lie to show a better image of us
Long live Fady
And sometimes we lie
because we're keeping a secret
- And we don't want to reveal it to anyone
- l don't get it
Thank you
Could you tell me what
has Omar done for you to...
Mu'taz, please, l don't
wanna talk about this again
- Sarah hasn't broken up with Omar yet?
- Omar?
- Where is he?
- He's with her right now
Omar?
l told you Mu'taz not
to ever mention this subject
- But, you shouldn't act like this
- Excuse me, Leila guy
Come with me, l wanna talk to you
lt's not iust about Leila, whatever
No, not this one indeed, l would
never look at someone like that
- Why don't you answer?
- That's nobody
- He's not answering, where would he be?
- In the office indeed
l'll meet him there, write down the
address for me, l'll go get my purse
By the way Mu'taz, you're an asshole
l had to save my friend
from your deceitful friend Leila
Ping Pong, don't be a fool
Man, l wanna be honest with you
Lies always let a person down, lies
are short-lived and l...
- l lied to you too
- You lied to me?
Sarah is not a crook
Sarah is not a crook
l just want you to get me to her
- l wanna lay hands on her
- It's clear that she hurt you so
On the contrary, Sarah
is the love of my life, man
You cannot imagine
what a good match we were
Just a foolish argument that happens
with any couple spoiled my whole life
- What the hell...
- l love Sarah, man
Please, you're my
only way to her now... man
Just calm down
What is it?
- Sarah used to draw
- What?
She had turned my life into a nice
drawing and made my memories so colorful
- Please man, do it for me
- Okay, okay
- l beg you, man, l'm in love with Sarah
- Okay, okay
You surely understand me
you surely have a heart
- You understand what l'm feeling, right?
- Yes, yes, l understand
Just calm down for God's sake
- Stop crying, stop
- l love her man
l believe you, iust
have mercy on your hand
- Stop, stop
- Stop it, leave me alone
Stop chit-chatting, man, leave me alone
- Leave me alone, man
- The man is a lunatic
l wanna be alone for a while
What does he want?
Hello? Yeah Mu'taz?
What? She said she's coming
to see me in your office?
Fine, fine, see you later, see you later
lt's a friend of mine l was supposed
to meet him but it's a bit late
Mr. Fady, l don't know what to say
- To be honest...
- Yes, be honest, man
To be honest, l looked for
her really and found nothing...
- Found what?
- l'll tell you
l found nothing about her on our
network, she might have left Egypt
She must have left Egypt
What's wrong Mr. Fady?
You're okay, Mr. Fady?
ls there anyone here to help?
Is there anyone here to help?
- Should l leave?
- Okay
Where is the nurse
l usually see with you?
- It's okay
- May l leave now?
- Excuse me
- Go on
Excuse me
- Yehya
- You brought tears to my eyes, sir
- He's going to see her, get him to me
- Just a second
- What is it Fady?
- Out of my way
He knows Sarah's number and
is talking to her as a friend of his
- Be cool
- What the hell?
l told you he's talking to her
as if she was his friend, man
- l'll kill him, l'll kill him
- Fady
Don't work for me
l don't want to have dinner
Nobody messes with Fady Atawya
Uncle Hussein, Mu'taz
told me to come to...
He told me
How are you doing, Mr. architect?
Why aren't you answering my calls?
- You're not answering your phone at all
- Was it me?
- l didn't know you hold grudges
- And you've got a complex about black
- Why are you breathless?
- It's nothing
l was iust drawing a high stairway
- Because you're scared of lifts, right?
- l hate to use the lift, there is a big difference
Why don't you draw me a chair to sit on?
Have a seat, you sat?
Leave the triangle alone
- Leave the triangle alone
- How come they are both triangles?
They have two different fathers, what's the
big deal? Genetic engineering, it's normal
- l wanna have a cappuccino cup
- What? What did you say?
- Cappuccino
- Cappuccino?
- Yeah
- You drink cappuccino?
- Yeah
- Since when you drink cappuccino?
l'm a cappuccino addict, it's
the first thing l do when l get up
- l drink a cup before breakfast
- A cup before breakfast? A whole cup?
Not iust a small amount?
- And you take the regular one?
- The regular cappuccino with the foam
The foam? Who's the foam?
It's the nickname of the dealer, right?
You're a dangerous girl, the foam, huh?
What's wrong with you?
It's just cappuccino
Why don't you say where we can get some?
Mu'taz works his guts out to find some
- Cappuccino
- Cappuccino?
- You mean the brown drink?
- Yeah
The one with foam on the surface
we stir it and drink it in a mug?
Yeah
The hot one that
Ieaves a moustache?
No, we don't have any, we don't use it
lt was forbidden in the office
because it leaves a moustache
- Or do you love moustaches
- U-huh
What? You love moustaches?
Damn you Mu'taz
you love moustaches?
lt's okay, excuse me
- Hello?
- You're a fool or what?
l've been trying to call you
why the hell don't you answer?
l don't wanna hear your excuses
Listen, you should leave at once
Fady is coming your way
What? How the hell
he knew where l was?
Yehya? How did he met Yehya?
What? A gun? How much
has he paid for the gun?
He wants to kill? What road?
You've got the wrong number, Imad
- What is it?
- Nothing at all
We'd better leave now
coz there's no one in the office
We're all alone her
the devil is on his way
We might commit
a mistake or something
- let's go
- Hold on a minute
l wanna ask you something, where do
you sit when you call me? Here or there?
Here or there? Let's go it's not
time for being romantic now, let's go
- Don't be so rude
- Let's go
Wait, What's wrong with you today?
Why are you acting so weird?
Nothing, nothing
Why are you running?
Why don't you walk slowly?
This is how l walk in
the office, let's just go
- Backingham
- Don't tell me you're still angry with me
because of what my mom did
when l was gonna sleep over?
Not at all, your mom is a good woman
and you're a good woman too
Why should l be angry? It's nothing
By the way, l forgot my
nightgown at your house
The small one? Yeah l remember it
you used to wear it as a small girl
Look, nothing is lost in our house
l kept it for you with your
mom's veil, with your good mom
She's Backingham, a good woman
Sarah, Sarah
Hold on man, hold on

Patience

May you have more

He stole my tennis shoe
- Omar, how did you find me?
- From the traffic station
- You're kidding me?
- Indeed
Anyway, l don't like kidding
because it always end up with a smile
Enough drawing
Let me see, wow
this is a masterpiece
- What the hell? You're mad or what?
- Yes, yes, l'm a mad man
And l'm here to tell you that the
nightgown she talked about is for Mu'taz
- Is that so?
- Yes
l mean it belongs to Mu'taz and this
girl is a friend of his, l don't know her
l swear, l hope to die, l hope you
get paralyzed if l'm lying to you
You're the only woman
l've ever known, believe me
Forget about that please
for my sake, forget about it
- What's this?
- Forget about it please
- There
- There
A room for rent, call the driver
This mobile is at Fayyum
it used 1 8 K of the network
One second and
l'll get you the right address
Hello? Yes Mr. Fady
l know where they are
- How can l help you sir?
- Go get Sarah
- Who's asking for her?
- Move, quickly, move, quickly
- Go ahead, eat your plate
- Alright
Sarah, l have an
important thing to tell you
Sarah, l...
- Miss Sarah, somebody's asking for you
- Who is it?
- Excuse me Omar
- Go on
Would you like to drink anything?
l must tell her the truth
l tell her, l tell her not
l tell her, l tell her not
l tell her, l tell her not, what the hell?
l should have asked for a pasta dish
it would have been much easier
What took her so long?
What took you so long?
l was gonna go
check on you, l couldn't eat
- What's wrong?
- l don't know
lt's something in my eye
that's bringing tears to my eyes
- Could you get me a handkerchief?
- Indeed, hold on a second
Tarek
- Could you give me a chance to explain?
- Explain or lie to me?
- Please
- Why did you lie to me?
- What have l done to you?
- l just wanted to get closer to you
When you told me you
dreamt about you, was it a lie?
lt was real but to me, it was a dream
- Sarah
- How? l dreamt about you too
- l took you to the hospital
- Even the nice thing turned out to be a lie
l promise you that after today
there will be nothing but the truth
Believe me
Sarah
l don't believe you
You're a liar
There it is, sir
You know very well what's the
sanction of spying on the customers
You'll be brought to iustice
along with Miss Nagwa
- Because to do such a terrible thing...
- Nagwa has nothing to do with this
l entered the room
she didn't know a thing
Consider yourself on a long vacation
until the investigation started
Move
Calm down, never mind
- Why don't you take a smoke?
- l can't, l can't...
- Mu'taz, the name is Mu'taz
- l can't Mu'taz
- No news from work?
- They're investigating
lnvestigating what? It's a murder
Look, why don't we listen
to your friend's show?
Although l hated to listen to him
- Let's take another call, hello
- Hello
Hello Riham, how are you doing?
We haven't heard from you for a long time
What's new?
You told me once that
if l encountered love, l should get hold of it
But l think that even if you encountered
Iove, you should stay away from it
Why are you saying that Riham?
Because love is a big illusion
there is no such thing as love
Even if l decided to get married
l'll do it the traditional way
Something normal, without love
Hello Riham, you're still with me?
l think the line went dead, let's
take another call and say hello
- Hello?
- Yes, good evening
- Yeah
- Who's speaking?
- It's Tarek or Omar, you choose
- Why are you so gloomy, man?
Because you don't understand a thing, what
about forgiveness you used to talk about?
We really should forgive, Tarek
l wanna tell you that
a person could lie without noticing
l didn't... no, l knew, l knew l was lying
but l couldn't tell her
l was scared of losing her
Besides, she's lying too, she doesn't
give her real name when she calls you
l love her, hello? l love her, hello?
Hello? Hello?
- l think the line is dead
- Hello?
But Tarek or Omar
- l think you can hear me
- Hello? Hello?
He must have hung up
Tarek, he must have hung up
- If you can hear me...
- No, he didn't hang up
l'm telling you he
hung up, believe me he did
- Love is a strange thing
- Why?
Why did he hang up?
Is this Friday? Why did he hang up?
- Why did you hang up?
- He hang up, just listen to me, he hung up
No
- What are you doing Tarek?
- Why didn't he answer?
- Why didn't he answer?
- Calm down
- Calm down
- Why didn't he answer?
- It's no use, iust forget about it
- No, l won't forget
Wait Tarek, where are you going? Wait
l said wait, don't you act like a lunatic
Hold on
Hold on you crazy man, Tarek
Wait, Tarek, wait
Tarek, wait, l'm coming with you
Sarah, Sarah loves me
- Sarah loves me, do you understand?
- Yes l do
- Do you understand?
- Yes l do
But l want you to ask her, Sarah, Su
- Who should l ask?
- Ask Sarah
- What will bring her here?
- She's here, you can ask her
There she is, ask her
- Who's she? Where is Sarah?
- Man, this is Sarah, the girl l'm looking for
Not the one you've
found and hidden from me
- So bad, man, so bad
- What?
She's the Sarah you were looking for?
Are you sure?
l don't know what to say
l'm terribly sorry for the mess l caused
l'd like to kiss me but
excuse me l'm already engaged
- l don't know what to tell you
- You cannot believe where l found her
She was married to a friend of mine, the
only one l didn't look for her at his house
Why did you do this to me, then?
Because it could have been her?
And then, we wouldn't fit together
- Man, you're such a moron
- Tarruk, l love you so
lndeed, you're getting
dressed up and wearing perfume
while l was looking everywhere for you
l looked for you at Sarah's house
and didn't find you, where were you?
- Sarah wasn't Sarah, Mu'taz
- What?
Sarah wasn't Sarah, yes
She's not the same
Sarah Fady was looking for
What? l told you a thousand times
to forget about this, forget about it
Just tell me, how do l look?
Should l change this shirt?
l wanted to iron it but
l couldn't find the hot iron
l'm going to her, Zizo
Sarah and her parents
are at Adham's house
So what's the big deal?
l know where is Adham's
house, l'll meet her there
Sarah and Adham have been engaged
- Tarek, l'm sorry but l had to tell you
- But l'd like to see her
Tarek, calm down and listen to me
You're a very nice guy
Don't let the world drift you apart
like me and become totally careless
- She told me she didn't love Adham
- If she loved you, she'd have forgiven you
But l hurt her, l hurt her Mu'taz
There we are, calm down and don't
get tensed, you're gonna see her, okay?
Wait, wait, l'm coming with you
- Where to?
- l'm coming to see Sarah
l'm coming to Mr. Adham's flat
- Who should l tell him?
- Tell him it's Tarek el-Wakil
- Hold on a second
- Tell him it's Tarek el-Wakil
What are you doing?
Wait for her to come down
When he tells her it's me
she'll let me go up
- She'll let me go up
- Nobody's answering
What do you mean?
Come on Tarek, don't
pick up a fight with him
l won't be scared this time
l lost years of my life being afraid
I won't be a regular person
l will defy any circumstances
l won't be scared this time
l lost years of my life being afraid
I won't be a regular person
l will defy any circumstances
l'll get to you even if l could get killed
l'll get to you and you should feel for the
one who's deeply madly in love with you
l'll get to you even if l could get killed
l'll get to you and you should feel for the
one who's deeply madly in love with you
lf l couldn't touch your hands
l can very much die seeing that...
you're longing for me
Separation, separation
is the worst feeling ever
When two persons are in love
to be separated is like a straight
wound deep into the heart
lf we're in love, we should
get hold of our love
We should care for one another
we should stay hand in hand
We should get hold of our
Iove... with all our might
lf you wanted
something so bad, let it go
lf it comes back to you
it's yours forever
lf it didn't, it wasn't
yours in the first place
l can't believe my eyes
you're really here
Why don't you take these off
first before you fall down again?
- l dreamt about you
- Again?
- No really, l dreamt about you
- What did you dream about?
- You won't believe me
- Never mind, just say it
- l dreamt you held my hand
- The left or the right?
- It was the left
- But l held the right hand
- What do you mean?
- l paid you a visit at the hospital
No kidding? Then, let's go to the
hospital, l mean, let's get out of here
l'm fired anyway
Mom used to always tell me that
the person who falls down is a fool
l hope she gets back safe and sound
Hello? Who do you want?
Omar Abu el-Wafa?
You've got the wrong number
