[Rap]
Word up, son, word
Yeah. To all the killers
and hundred dollar billers
Fellas
For real n... as
Who ain't got no feelin's
Check it out now
I got you stuck
off the realness
We be the infamous
You heard of us, official
Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped
for warfare
Beware of my crime family
who got enough shots to share
For all those
who want to profile and pose
Rock you in your face
Stab your brain with your nosebone
You all alone
in these streets, cousin
Every man for theyself
in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews
runnin'like they suppose to
They come around
but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face
You're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get
their whole body laced up
with bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man
and you will get touched
You can put your whole army
against my team
I guarantee it'll be your
very last time breathin'
Your simple words
just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game
and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have
to call your name out
Your crew's featherweight
My gunshots will
make you levitate
I'm only 19
but my mind is old
When the things get for real
my warm heart turns cold
Another n... a deceased
Another story gets told
It ain't nothin'really
Hey, yo, son spark that Phillie
So I can get my mind off
these yellowbacked n... s
Why they still alive
I don't know, go figure
[Knocking]
Hold on a minute!
I couldn't choose
a better location
When the slugs penetrate
you feel a burning sensation
Getting closer to God
in a tight situation
Now, take these words home
and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write
might be about you
Son they shook
'cause ain't no such things
as halfway crooks
[Man]
What the fuck.!
Hold on a fuckin' minute!
'Cause there ain't no thing
as halfway crooks
Scared to death
And scared to look
Livin'the life
that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you
can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down
and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts end
straight up shook ones
Shook ones
[Rap Beat]
[Chattering]
[Panting]
[Vomiting]
[Pounding]
[Vomiting Continues]
Yo! What the fuck?
Yo.! What the fuck, man.!
Quit playin'with
your fuckin'self!
Open the door.!
[Toilet Flushing]
What the fuck, man!
Who the fuck is you, nigga?
Where the hell do you
think you going?
Going backstage.
I'm in the battle.
You can't go backstage.
Come on, dawg.
I got a stamp on my hand.
You gotta go around front.
You just seen me, dawg!
I just came from...
I didn't see nothin'.
Man, you just fuckin' seen me!
I just went to the bathroom!
Whoa! What's happening?
This guy's got a fuckin'
problem with me!
Shut the fuck up.
He's straight, dawg.
He's straight.
He with you?
Yeah.
Okay, cool, Future.
But I think your boy
got a attitude problem.
You a crazy motherfucker,
you know that, trying to
fight bouncers and shit.
The fuckin' guy's obviously
got somethin' against me.
I go to the bathroom,
come right back, he's actin'
like he don't know me.
Hold on, man.
You fuckin' threw up
on yourself, huh?
Come here, man.
[Laughing]
Hey, Rabbit.
I know you ready, Rabbit.
Where you going?
He hurled on his shirt.
Let's see.
Yo! Get the fuck off me,
Cheddar.
What are you doin', man?
Come on.
It's deal time, Rabbit.
Our clique'll be on the map
after you whup some ass tonight.
Me and Janeane
just broke up.
What, again?
And I left her the car.
Oh, come on, Rabbit.
Yo, she says she's pregnant.
She's gonna need the car
if she's pregnant.
I'm gonna need
a place to crash.
- You gonna stay at your mom's?
- [Laughing]
Come on.
Yo! Can I get some fuckin'
privacy here, man?
All right.
Come on, man, come on.
Why?
Yo, my bad, man.
Look, if something's going
to happen with this shit,
it needs to happen now.
Hey, man, I feel you.
I know exactly what

All right, come on, man.
How you feelin'?
I feel good.
You feel good?
Yeah.
I'm ready.
You sure?
You ready, baby.
I wanna see you rip
that shit, all right?
It's time to let
these motherfuckers know.
Yeah, you, baby.
Three-One-Third.
It's all you, baby.
Your lyrics are shitty
Like when I cop a squat
Who told you could fuck
with the mighty Papa Doc
For steppin' on his stage
I should rock your knot
Don't get too close
or you might get shot
Yo, nigga, call your mama
and tell her come get you
And if she knew him
she could bring your
midget pops with her
I put a hole in your head
like a. 12-gauge
Lookin'like Kris Kross
Jiggity-jump your ass on stage
'Cause I'm a grown man, son
I'll slaughter you
Make your ma wish that
her fat ass aborted you
Whoa.! A lot ofhostility
at the end of the 45 seconds.
Let me get that mike from you.
Open up a little bit.
Let everybody see your Future.
Know what I mean?
How y'all feelin' about
Shorty Mike right here?
[Booing, Yelling]
Kind of mediocre love?
Just a'ight for Shorty Mike?
What do you all think
of Papa Doc, man?
That's what I'm talking about.!
Papa Doc.!
[Cheering]
A'ight, brother,

All right, all right.
Enough of the fanfare.

Heads.
Tails. Choose.
You first.
- Show.

D.J., 45 seconds. Spin that shit.

He the type to lose
a fight with a dyke
They don't laugh
'cause you wack
They laugh 'cause

[Laughing]
You're a laughingstock
When will this laughin'stop
When you and Everlast
Bitch-ass, get popped
You a wigga that
invented rhyme for money
Watch Li'I Tic split kick
the Energizer Bunny
Rip the Rabbit head off
Toss it to Hugh Hefner
'Cause I don't play, boy
Now tell me who's fresher
[Crowd] You are!
L. T., that's right
Cock the heat and shoot ya
I'll punish Rabbit
Or obsolete Future
My paws love
to maul an M.C.
'Cause he faker than a psychic
with caller I.D.
So that bullshit
Save it for storage
'Cause this is hip-hop

You're a tourist
So put your hockey sticks

'Cause this here Detroit
16 Mile Road is thataway

[Future]
Whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay.

[Dog Barking]
[Moaning]
What the fuck?
Oh, God.
Oh, shit, Rabbit.
You okay, baby?
Don't you think you should have

I mean...
The phone's disconnected.
I know that, Rabbit.
I got to get down to
the phone place tomorrow and...
- I been busy, you know?
- Rabbit, what the fuck

How about knockin'?
Me and Janeane just broke up.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I thought you had a really
good thing goin' with her.
- She sleepin'
with somebody else?
- No.
Yo, I got to work

You and Future still,

No. I'm down in
New Detroit Stamping now.
Oh. Well, that's good.

[Scoffs]
[Giggling]
He got fired from
a pizza place.
Yo. At least
I got a fuckin'job.
Okay, stop it.
Only ex-cons and welfare moms
work at that plant, man.
Baby, are y-you stayin' here
for a while or what?
Just for a couple weeks.
Got to save up enough
to get my own place.
Just like Bob Zurowsky.
You're plannin' on still living
at home, aren't you, Rabbit?
Okay.
What a bunch
of fuckin' losers.
- Fuck you.!
- Jimmy.!
- What's your problem,
you little ingrate?
- What's your problem?
Don't kick my fuckin' clothes!
Don't fuckin'judge me, man!
Why don't you grow up?
Goin' around actin' like a punk.
Motherfucker, what's up?
Stop!
Fuckin' punk!
Stop it.!
- [Dog Barking]
- Hey, Lily.
Hey, baby.
What are you still doin' up?
You woke me up, you know.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, baby.
- What'd I do?
Let's go back to bed.
Will you sing to me?
Yeah, of course I will.
Come on.
I know this girl
Her name is Lily
And it's past her bed
T-I-M-E
She goes to sleep
And she can just dream
And not have to be
In a stinky trailer with me
So when I feel blue
Don't know what to do
I look at you
And I just say...
[Blows Raspberry]
[Giggles]
Good night, baby.
Go to sleep.
Rabbit, if you're gonna live here,
you have to get along with Greg.
He started it.
You can't fuck this up
for me, baby.
You just can't.
Whatever.
No milk.
Yo, can I get a ride
to work in the morning?
Where's your car?
I left it with Janeane.
- You're gonna let me
borrow your car?
- Nope.
It's your birthday present.
My birthday's not for two weeks.
I know.
But you're still
my little Rabbit, right?
I need to get to sleep.
[Engine Doesn't Crank]
[Turns Key,
Engine Doesn't Crank]
Bunny.! What up, doe?
Heard about
you and Janeane, dawg.
- Thought you
might be back home.
- This ain't my home.
Why you up so early?
Up, man?
I ain't even been to bed, dawg.
I came to talk to you...
Yo, I don't got time to talk
right now. I'm late for work.
Can you give me a ride?
My ma's got the car.
Yo, don't tell nobody
I'm livin' back here, man.
All right, dawg.
What happened to you last night?
I heard you got caught out.
People sayin'
some fucked up shit.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Man, why you still goin'
to The Shelter, dawg?
Ain't nobody down there
but a bunch of clowns who ain't
got deals and never gonna get deals.
You need to stay at home.
You know Wink's got ya.
Whatever, man.
Look, I'm telling you, man,
I'm on my way.
And I'm takin' you with me.
You're the franchise, baby.
The franchise?
Yeah.
I'm takin' a fuckin'
bus to work, man.
Look. I was just on the horn
with my man Roy Darucher.
That promo guy?
Yeah. Now Roy's
all hooked up at 98.
So what's he need you for?
What's he need me for?
Talent, dawg.
And you know
that's my specialty.
I'm the one that tipped him
on Big O and got that fat man
out of flippin' burgers.
Roy liked what he heard,
split some cash out
for that nigga's demo...
and... boom... just like that,
Big O got himself a deal,
and it's all because of me.
Roy paid
for Big O's demo?
Every penny.
If they thought Big O was hot,
wait till they get a taste
of B-Rabbit.
I'm building an empire.
I'm taking you with me.
You're next.
A'ight.
I'll talk to you later.
A'ight.
Call me later, dawg.
Okay.
[Rap Beat]
Feel like
Still might
Still write
Real life
Gonna jump on stage
Kill mikes
Still white
Hate life
Brake lights
Stage fright
Drawin'a blank, like
Up! Down!
Up.! Down.!
What up, Manny?
I know.
You was late today, Smith.
It wasn't my fault.
My car wouldn't start.
It ain't never your fault.
I don't want to hear it.
I guess this probably
isn't the best timing,
but I really need
some extra shifts, Manny.
Are you shittin' me?
You just started working here...
Hey, Dutton.
Is he shittin' me?
What?
You late again, Smith,
and you're fired.
I'm lookin' for
John Latourno.
I can take you.
I don't think so, Smith.
Right this way.
Thank you.
["Sweet Home Alabama"]
[Greg Singing Off-Key]

They met at bingo.
Wait. Greg Buehl?

He went to our school, right?
[Chuckles]

This shit is ridiculous.
[Continues... Guitar]
Well, Jimmy moved in
with his mother
'Cause he ain't got
no place to go
And now I'm right back
in the gutter
With a garbage bag
that's full of clothes
Bust it, bust it.
'Cause you live at home
in a trailer
What the hell
you gonna do
Yee-haw.!
'Cause I live at home
in a trailer
- Mom, I'm comin' home to you
- Break it down.
Well, my name is Jimmy
His name's Greg Buehl
- Me, him and you
We went to the same school
- School
This ain't cool
I'm in a rage
He's tappin' my mom
We're almost the same age
On the microphone
I drop bombs
Look at this car
Thanks a lot, Mom
Here, happy birthday, Rabbit
Here's a brand-new car
You can have it
A 1928 Delta
The shit won't even
get me to The Shelter
And I can't even say
I'm from Motown
'Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now
'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you
Jimmy,
you know there's another
battle next week, right?
- And I don't want to hear shit
about it. I'm signin' you up.
- Man, don't.
- Come on. You got to battle.
- Future, I'm not you, dawg.
- Look at me.
- Listen, once they hear you,
it won't matter
what color you are.
Look, you win
some of these battles,
Three-One-Third will have
all the street credit we need,
with you and me as the anchors.
Yo, did you hear that,
uh, Wink has been talkin'
to that promo guy?
[Chuckles]
Yeah. I heard that bullshit.
- Look, Wink is scandalous, dawg.
- Could be a shot.
You know I'm tryin' to get
straight with the Lord,
my man up there.
So I don't really like
bringin' too much negative
toward my positive world.
But Wink is just talkin' shit.
There'll be no action, just talk...
Sweet home Alabama
You got a cigarette?
[Laughing]
- The dude mentally ill?
- Car accident, man.
He's supposed to get some big
settlement check soon or some shit.
Man, will you hurry up
with that thing?
- Yo, try it now.

[Engine Cranking]
Give it some gas.

Shit. How much I really,
really like your mama, Rabbit.
[Laughs]
But she wasn't doin'you no favor
when she left you this car, man.
Fuck you.
Get out and walk.
At least the radio plays.
[Rap]
What up with the whole
East Coast/West Coast thing?
Word.
We got to put the Mo

[Siren Blaring, Approaching]
That rifle ain't mine, right, Jimmy?
I don't want to go to jail.
Shut the fuck up, Cheddar.
I'm fuckin' serious.
I get claustrophobic.
You were scared.
You were scared.
No, you were scared.
You were scared.
Man, you know how many
abandoned buildings
we have in Detroit?
How are you supposed to
take pride in your neighborhood
with shit like that next door?
And does the city
tear 'em down?
No. They too busy
building casinos and taking
money from the people.
Shut your preachin' ass up.
Nobody care about that shit.
Did you care when
that crackhead raped
that little girl?
You think that would have happened
if he didn't have an abandoned house
to take her to?
They caught him,
didn't they?
Yeah, they caught him.
Dumb motherfucker
went back to the house.
How stupid
could a nigga be?
Yo, Rabbit. What's happening
under that hood, man?
It's just a short. Chill out.
I ain't gettin' back in

It's a deathtrap.
I think Jimmy's mom's

Come on down.
Hey, girl, uh, it's gonna be
your only opportunity to blow
the both of us, baby.
'Cause after we go platinum,
you won't be able to get
to me and Future.
And, uh, why do
they call you Future?
See, I had a lot of names,
you know, the most conceited kind.
I was, uh, Maximum Brimstone,
Godfather "D" Devastatin' "D"
Big "D"...you know,
that has a double meaning to it.
But see, none of those
really worked for me...
till I started hosting those battles
down at The Shelter.
One day, somebody said,
"You know what, man?
You are the future
of hip-hop in Detroit."
So you see, baby,
sometimes you got to find
your name and, uh,
other times,
your name finds you.
You want to
smoke some ganja?
See, that's our problem.
If we don't respect
our sisters, who will?
Yo, we're doin' it
to ourselves.
He's my brother.
He don't like pussy.
Yo, Rabbit.
Teach me to write rhymes.
That's the way
to get the ladies, right?
Let me out.
Yo, yo, hold up.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know Papa and L.C.
Were on their bullshit until tonight.
Look, man, you know I wouldn't
be messin' with them...
except I'm promotin' a show with
them at the Hip-Hop Shop next week.
Those Free World bitches?
You see that the fuck
I'm talkin' about, Jimmy?
Look, man, they're
just one of the acts.
Hey, Jimmy, if you want,
I'll step out, man.
You're my friend.
I don't want you
bein' mad at me.
Man, do what you want to do.
Yeah, do what
you want to do, dawg.
Only respect, baby.
Let's go.
Respect yourself, sister.
Hey, don't you
ever shut up, man?
Why you got to push me?
Damn, Future.
Man, what the hell
is his problem?
Future?
Yeah.
- Thinks sometimes
you talk some bullshit.
- Who is he to say what's real?
Just 'cause he hosts
those battles?
Ain't thatJaneane
over there?
- Oh, yeah.
- I thought she was pregnant.
- I'm out, dawg. I'll be outside.
- Yeah.
A'ight.
A'ight, man.
By myself.
[Laughing]
I'm gonna ask him.
Well, here's your chance, girl.
Go ahead.
You'reJimmy Smith, Jr.
Yeah.
My name's Alex.
So did you find the guy
you was lookin' for?
What guy?
The friend.
Yeah. That was my brother.
I was borrowing a car.
So... I hear you're
a real dope rapper.
A dope rapper?
Yeah.
Who told you
I was a dope rapper?
You know, it's around.
If you're so dope,
what you doin' workin' over
at Dead End Stampin'?
Your brother works there.
Yeah, my brother's a loser.
What about you?
I'm workin' at Intermezzo,
savin' up enough cash
to get out of this place.
Well, busin' dishes is much better
than pressin' bumpers.
I'm not gonna
be there long.
Where are you goin'?
New York.
I won this modeling contest
a couple of months ago.
One of the judges said
he could help me out.
Just got to get
a book together.
What if he ain't for real?
All I'm lookin' for
is a ticket.
Yo, Rabbit. You and your
new friend want to bounce
to an after-hours spot?
Rabbit?
Let me go ask my friends.
So how'd it go?
Guys, why don't we go to
this after-hours club?
So where we goin'?
Hmm? Oh. My house.
What about your mom?
Workin' nights now.
This the after-hours spot?
Heck, yeah.
Can some of us
ride with you?
[Laughing]
- Why do they call you Rabbit?
- He's fast and he likes to fuck.
- Oh, well.
- Get your hand off my balls!
- Man, why do you be all ignorant for?
- Oh, shit! Jimmy.
- What's the matter with you?
- My bad, you guys.
So you signed anything yet?
Not yet, but but I'm workin'
on a little somethin' somethin'.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. He's gonna be courtin'
a demo at MCA soon.
- Really?
- Yeah, well...
If you really
want to seeJimmy flow,
make sure you come down
to the next battle at The Shelter.
Yeah.! He's the best.!
- Shut up, Cheddar.
- When's the battle?
- Friday night.
Yeah? Can I come?
There's no way I'm fuckin'
battlin' next Friday, dawg.
You know damn well
you're gonna battle if she's there.
'Cause you're gonna
want to be the man,
you know what I'm sayin'?
All right, man.
Just don't fuckin' push.
Guess we all need to be pushed.
Ha. My bad. I'm sorry.
[Laughing]
You gonna let him push you?
You could never catch me
and you never will!
Out of my way,
freaky girl!
[Laughing]
Wipe your feet!
[Hip-hop]
You like?
Hmm?
She's getting out
of the "D," though.
Hey, bro, please.
That's what they all say.
Nah. I think she's different.
Hey, man, that chick
really blew both you guys?
I'm a sinner, James.
Come to the church with me
in the morning, a'ight?
Hey.
Uh, I saw you talkin'
to Papa Doc in Chin Tiki.
How you know him?
You mean Clarence?
He went to Cranbrook
with Christine's brother.
Do you want to dance?
Not right now.
Fuckin' Wink, man.
Tryin' to keep us in division
with all that fake-ass,
Big Willie wannabe talk.
Shit wrong with a free demo.
Free comes with a dick
right up your ass, Jimmy.
Three-One-Third is real.
The shit that Wink
is talkin' about is wack.
I don't understand
why the media's not
all over this.
It's just a matter of time
before it all happens again.
The city don't give a fuck.
[Together]
What the hell
is he talkin' about?
That abandoned house where
that little girl got raped.
[D.J. Iz] What you call
"an attractive nuisance. "
You better believe that place
wouldn't still be standing if it
was on the other side of 8 Mile.
It could have
been Lily, Rabbit.
Burn this shit
down to the ground.
Burn it down.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- Okay, I got it.
Fuckin' yeah, man.
Let's burn this fuckin' thing down.
- Let's go, Cheddar.
- This is the definition
of an attractive nuisance.
- Hey, Rock.! Come on, Rock.
Let's burn this thing.
- Right behind you, man.
- That's what I'm talkin'about.
- Yeah, baby.
Could have sworn
I had some matches.
You got some?
You got my lighter?
I gave it back to you.
- I got one.
- Wink, you got the lighter?
[All]
No!
- Oh, shit! Get out!
- Run!
Hey, what the fuck,
you guys?
I'm out!
Fuck you, Cheddar!
[Laughing]
Hey, Rabbit, word!
Rah! Hey, I burned
the house down!
[Laughing]
The roof
The roof
The roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn
Burn, motherfucker
Burn
It's almost beautiful.
When I was little,
I used to want to live
in a house like this.
You know, how it used to be.
You live with your family?
[Siren Blaring, Distant]
I got out of there
as quick as I could.
Left home when I was 17.
What about you?
Sort of the same.
[Cheering, Shouting]
[Dog Barking]
When you record a demo,
I'd really love to be there.
Alex.
Hey, girl.
You're gonna be great.
[Siren Blaring]
I got a feelin' about ya.
[Woman]
Let's go, Alex.
See ya.
See ya.
[Sirens Blaring, Continues]
[Future]
Cheddar, bring your ass on.! Come on.!
[Sirens, Approaching]
[TVPlaying]
[TVCharacter]
Doggone pesky mosquitoes.
Now, let's see.
Oh, yeah.
And the mirror said...
Shit.!
What's the matter?
We're bein' evicted.
Goddamn it!
Come on, Mom.
Not in front of Lily.
I can't let Greg
find out about this.
Fuck Greg.
Okay.
I'm three months late.
We got 30 days
to come up with the money.
What do you mean "we"?
If you're gonna live here,
you got to start chippin' in, Rabbit.
When's Greg gettin'
his settlement check?
Get the money from him.
No, no, I can't.
He's gonna ask me and Lily
to move away with him.
Someplace nice, real soon.
I-I can't freak him out.
You got to stop
livin' your life like this.
If you really cared about Lily,
you would get a job
and quit fuckin'around.
I got to go.
Be late for work.
What are you doin'
with your life that's
so great, Rabbit?
Wink's workin' on a deal where
I can get free studio time...
to record my demo.
Yeah. Right.
Bye, baby.
Alex Latourno
Hotter than an inferno
Up.!
Hotter than
a crack house
- Down!
- Burn internal
Up.! Down.!
I don't know why Manny's got to
give me so much shit all the time, man.
Maybe it's 'cause you
keep giving him reason to.
Stick to the plan, man.
Just do your work
and shut the fuck up.
Up.!
Down!
Why haven't you called?
Janeane, I can't
talk about this here.
You're gonna get me fired.
I'm your girlfriend.
No, you're
not my girlfriend.
We broke up.
I'll call you later.
You just took off
without sayin' a word.
At least I left you the car.
Was it 'cause I said
I was pregnant?
Come on, Janeane.
I know why you said that bullshit.
You got to get out of here.
I didn't know
what else to do.
Tell me why you left
and I'll leave you alone.
It's not you, okay?
Janeane, it's me.
It's my shit. I had to go.
Why?
What are you running from?
Nothing.
Would you just go?
You know that everybody's
calling you a loser
from the other night?
- Who said that?
- Everybody's talking about it.
How you froze up
and got booed offstage.
- Fuck you, Janeane. Go home.
- [Chuckling]
- What was all that about?
- I'm sorry, Manny. It wasn't my...
- It won't happen again.
- Good.
Don't be bringin'
that shit around here.
Now get back to work.
Rakim was the first rapper
to get complex lyrics, man.
I give you Rakim, no question.
But as far as beat and lyrics
go, Biggie is the bomb.
I don't believe this shit.
Y'all gonna talk about
complex shit and then
leave out my man Tupac.
Fuck Tupac!
Fuck Tupac?
Nigga, you crazy!
- Pac's the only lyrical
motherfucker out there.
- His shit do got emotion.
What about the Beasties?
[Future]
Man, fuck the Beasties.
How you even gonna bring
the Beasties' shit in the mix?
They bust
some serious shit.
No. The white boys,
that's more like busters
on some serious shit.
I ain't gonna
be bumpin' no Beastie,
but it's always easier for
a white man to succeed in
a black man's medium, right?
[Future]
Word up. That's true.
Yo! Whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.!
- All right.
What you doin', man?
Rabbit!
- Oh, shit.!
- Don't you worry, Rabbit.
I got your back.
Hey. Hey, what's up, "B"?
- You wanna fuck with us, bitch?
- Shut your bitch-ass up.
- [Yelling]
- Get off my man!
Yo, get off me, man.!
[Gunshot]
Yeah! You wanna
fuck with us? Huh?
- Fuck with us, yeah?
- Cheddar, what the fuck
are you doin'?
- Where did you get that shit?
- It's my mom's.
Man, put that shit away, dawg,
before you fuckin' kill somebody!
- Papa Doc had one!
- Put it away!
- Man, put that down, man.
- Come on, Cheddar.
- Okay. All right.
- [Gunshot]
- Fuck man.!
- Oh, shit.!
- What the fuck?
- Shit.
- Let's get out of here.
You all right, man?
Oh, shit!
[All Yelling]
We got to get him
to a hospital, dawg.
Keys?
Where are the keys?
Get the fuckin'car.!
[Yelling]
I got to put pressure on it.
I got to put pressure on it.
- Try not to think about it.
- He shot his fuckin' dick off!
Did I?
Man, shut the fuck up, man!
Future,
take Gratiot to McDougall.
I live here too.
I know how to get there.
Then fuckin' get us there then!
Rabbit's gonna teach me
how to write rhyme.
What the fuck were you doin'
with a gun anyway, man?
What the fuck were you doin'
with those motherfuckers?
- You know I had
a show tomorrow night!
- Calm the fuck down!
What are y'all trippin' about?
M.C. Bob.
What?
M.C. Bob.
Man, what are you
talkin' about?
Is that a good name?
What's wrong
with Cheddar Bob?
I like M.C. Bob.
Right?
Yeah. M.C. Bob.
[Wink]
I'm the one that got that
fat man out offlippin'burgers.
Really?
Yeah. Now Roy's gotta
interview him down atJLB.
And I'm gonna be there.
Oh, it's finna be on.
So the doctor said
that he hit an artery,
but he's gonna be okay.
Oh, yeah.
That's good, man.
Where you been?
Prayin'.
Is he all right?
Yeah. It's cool.
Let's go.
Wink was just tellin' us how
he got in with Roy Darucher.
Yeah. Shit's hot, man.
[Sol George]
He doin' an interview
down atJ LB.
Why you even listenin'
to this clown?
What?
You heard me.
Clown.
[Turning Key, Engine Dead]
Man, I don't even know why
you got to be all like that.
This is a good deal for him.
This shit is for real.
Oh. It's for real?
- Like that time you said
your cousin worked for Dr. Dre?
- [Snickering]
Or like that time you were
real tight with that intern
in Russell Simmons' office?
- [Laughing]
- Or how about the time...
Man, shut the fuck up!
Why you always
givin' me shit, man?
I mean, is it because
I'm makin' moves?
Or is it because your ass
is stuck hosting battles
for, like, two years?
- You're a fuckin' loser.
- Who the fuck you callin' a loser?
Chill, man! Chill!
How can you guys fight
about this shit now?
I know what you're trying
to do with our group, bitch!
[All Yelling]
Cheddar's layin' up
in the fuckin' hospital and
you guys want to fight about this?
So fuckin' stupid.
[Wink]
Forget this car, "B."
I'll give you a ride
to work in the morning.
[Woman On TV]
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
I don't have any
little colored girl in my class.
[Woman #2]
Why, there's Sarah Jane.
There's my baby.
You mean Sarah JaneJohnson?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Mrs. Johnson.
Sarah Jane, baby,
I brought you...
Sarah Jane.!
[Jimmy]
Did you win at bingo tonight?
No.
You record your demo yet?
What happened to you?
Cheddar Bob had an accident.
He's fine. I'm fine.
You and your friends.
Mom, don't start, please.
It's been a long fuckin' night.
Tell me about it.
Me and Greg
are havin' problems.
- He found out about the eviction?
- No.
The settlement check
ain't comin'?
No, it's comin;
It's comin'. It's our...
It's our sex life.
Mom, I don't want
to hear this shit.
I mean, it's good.
It's real good.
But he just doesn't like...
Mom, I don't want
to hear this.
Greg won't
go down on me.
Mom!
Hey, Sol. You ever wonder
what point you gotta
just say, "Fuck it, man"?
Like when you gotta
stop livin' up here
and start livin' down here?
It's 7:30
in the morning, dawg.
[Chuckles]
Yo, thank your mom
for the car, dawg.
A'ight.
Man, I'm gettin'
so sick and tired
Of fuckin' with this steel
They only give us 30 minutes
to eat lunch and chill
My body achin'
just to get a buck
I'm sick of eatin' this shit
off this fuckin' lunch truck
Nasty-ass food
I'm in a nasty-ass mood
I should have called in sick
Shit, I had somethin' to do
I can't believe I'm hearin'
all this ravin' and rantin'
From Vanessa up here
at the New Detroit Stampin'
You need to get your food
and take your ass back to work
You're dreamin' if you think
them corny-ass raps will work
Look at y'all
Standin'out here freezin'
like dumb fucks
Rappin' away for food
off this raggedy lunch truck
Who want what
Who pumped up
to get rolled up
I spit venom
in every direction
Soak some up
Look at this fat-ass nigga
Sloppy sucker
You an ugly motherfucker
Your pop should have
wore a rubber
Stop rhymin'
Keep your day job, Vanessa
Next time, leave that bullshit
home on the dresser
Speaking of dresses
Take a look at Paul the fruitcake
When you travel you probably
pack panties in your suitcase
Made out oflace
from Victoria's Secret
If ten men came in a cup
you'd probably drink it
[Crowd Groaning, Laughing]
Okay folks
Enough with the gay jokes
Especially from a gay broke
bitch yourself, eh, loc
Who is this...
His style is doo-doo
You've worked here
longer than me and I get
paid more than you do
Serious, man.
Dawg, take a seat
What's this guy
standin' in line for
He ain't got money to eat
Check this out
Yo, yo
This guy cashed his whole check
and bought one Ho-Ho
[Laughing]
Fuckin' homo, little maggot
You can't hack it
Paul's gay, you're a faggot
At least he admits it
Don't even risk it
- This guy's starvin' to death
Someone get him a biscuit
- [Laughing]
I don't know what
they told you, Mike
You must have had them
cornrows rolled too tight
This job, you wanna quit
But you can't
You've worked at this plant
so long, you're a plant
Look at your goddamn boots
For Christ sakes
- They're startin' to grow roots
- [Laughing]
On this mike you get faded
- You look like a pissed-off rapper
who never made it
- [Crowd] Ooh!
Hey, why you fuckin'
with the gay guy, "G"
When really you're the one
who's got the H.I.V.
[Crowd] Ooh!
Man, I'm done with this clown
He's soft
Fuck it, I'll let homegirl
finish you off
[Yelling]
[Vanessa] A guy like you
would never get a real woman
You jackass, gojack off
That's the only way you comin'
Hey, lookin' for your brother?
I was.
[Vanessa Continues,
Indistinct]
Do you want to
do somethin' tonight?
Are you askin' me out
on a date, Jimmy Smith, Jr.?
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I am.
Why don't you
take me somewhere now?
Come on.
[Chuckles]
Where are we going?
[Man]
Bro.! We gotta start
that second pallet.!
[Panting]
[Unzipping]
[Sighs]
[Gasping Intensifies]
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
You were so good outside.
- In line at a lunch truck?
- Yeah. And at the Chin Tiki
the other night?
And that demo thing
with Wink?
You're gonna get a deal soon.
[Whispers]
I feel it.
You was in the parkin' lot
the other night?
My friends think you're crazy.
Yo, your friends
don't even know me.
[Clattering, Banging]
[Knocking On Door]
[D.J. Iz]
Man, ain't nobody here.
[Future] I can't believe
they sent him home already.
If you ain't got insurance,
the medical establishment
will fuck you up.
Where the fuck else
would he be?
Just thank God he's alive.
[Scoffs]
No. Thank God he didn't
shoot his fuckin' dick off.
That's why brothers need
to sign themselves a deal.
I'm tellin' you.
Record labels supply niggas
with the benefits they need.
Dawg, if we sign us
a deal, you can take
the motherfuckin' benefits.
We talkin' Bentleys and Benjamins,
not Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
I don't give a fuck
about none of that.
I just wanna hear
Three And A Third on the box,
know what I'm sayin'?
One of them strong songs
on J LB, you know?
We need to save that shit up,
put it into savings bonds.
We can build
our own studio...
Savings bonds?
Let me ask you
a question, dawg.
How the fuck are we brothers?
We need fine bitches and phat rides,
- No goddamn savings bonds.
- That's all we ever do, man, is talk shit.
"We need to get fine bitches
and phat rides!"
"No, what we need to do is
put our money in savings bonds."
"No, what we need to do
is get our songs on J LB."
Man, shut the fuck up.
All of us never do shit about nothin'.
We're still broke as fuck
and live at home with our moms.
Yo, I'm outta here.
I'll catch you guys later.
Man, get yo' mad, ramblin'
ass in the car! [Laughs]
Yeah.
I hope you get a new ride soon.
Maybe for that
birthday trippin' ass.
I'm gonna call yo mama,
see what I can work out.
[Laughing]
- [Future] I got shotgun, Shabba.
- [D.J. Iz Laughing]
[Sol]
Nigga, get in the back, Farrakhan.
[Car Door Opens]
[Door Slamming, Engine Starting]
[Rap On TV, Indistinct]
Man, why you pretendin'
to be asleep?
Yo, I seen you
out the window, Bob.
I didn't feel like talkin'.
Why not?
I didn't want them
makin' fun of me.
Do you know what
I'm sayin' Rabbit?
Yeah.
You do?
M.C. Bob.
[Chuckles]
[Shuts Off Engine]
[Lily Laughing]
It's like you see
in the magazines and stuff?
Without doubt.
Hey, Rabbit.
Where ya been?
You call him Rabbit, too?
I gave him
that nickname.
Stop it.
N-No, I did.
When he was little,
he had buckteeth
and big ears...
[Giggling]
He was so cute.
"Wike a wittle wabbit."
Right, baby?
[Laughing]
[Both Continue Laughing]
[Dog Barking]
I got some good news...
You brought her
to my fuckin' moms?
What the fuck?
I invited her to my show.
She said we had to come and get you.
What was I supposed to do?
Look.
I been helpin' Al find
a photographer for her book.
All she keeps tellin' me is
how much she really likes you, man.
Damn!
Now, check this, dawg.
I heard from my man Roy today.
Now, he's gonna be down
toJ LB tomorrow night.
Doin' an interview with
Big O and shit. So what?
So what?
I dropped it! I told him
about your skills, man.
I said, Jimmy Rabbit's your man!
He said, bring him down...
and let me see
what he can do.
Look, man, if everything
goes well, you could be flowin'
down 54 Sound next week.
Now, can you get
your shit together in time?
Yeah.
I can do it.
My bad, man.
Oh, no problem, dawg.
[Snaps Fingers]
Big time, Jimmy.
Why'd you take off?
I don't really live here.
So?
Why'd you take off?
I just...
[Softly]
I just...
You don't have to be
embarrassed about
where you live, Jimmy.
I don't live here!
What's up with you
and Wink?
He's helpin' me
get my book together.
Usin' his connections.
Same way he's
helpin' you out.
So...
You probably have to
stay home tonight, huh?
Yeah, I should work
on some songs for my demo.
Okay.
[Dogs Barking]
[Driving Guitar]
Palms are sweaty
Sweaty already,
moms's spaghetti, he's nervous
Keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down
He opens his mouth
Words won't come out
The clock's run out
Turnin'and turnin'
You only get one shot
One shot, one shot
Opportunity-tunity lifetime
Lose yourself
Lose yourself, lose yourself
Turnin'and turnin'
You only get one shot
One shot, one shot
Opportunity-tunity lifetime, turn
You know your mom's
gettin' evicted?
Says right here.
"Tenant must vacate the premises...
due to non-payment of rent."
You know about this?
[Stephanie]
Morning.
Sweetie, you want some cereal?
I was just talkin'to your precious son
about this eviction situation.
You plan on tellin' me
about this, huh?
Oh, honey, th-that was
just a mistake.
You're
a fuckin' liar.
Hey, man!
No, no.
Stay out of this, Rabbit.
It's okay, don't worry.
I'm takin' care of...
- Don't!
- [Screams]
Fuck, man! What the fuck
is your problem?
You don't touch my mother, man.
Just stay out of it.
Stay out of it.
I'm out of here.
Can't go out with
someone like you.
Are you gonna let him just
talk to you like this?
- With two homeless kids.
- [Roaring, Screaming]
Rabbit.!
Jimmy, no.! No.!
Rabbit! Jimmy!
Jimmy, please!
[Grunts]
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop!

Come here.
It's okay.
Come here, baby.
Come here.
It's okay.

[Sighing]
It's over.
It's over, baby.
[Shuts Off Engine]
Yo, what up, doe?
Alex just called. I got
one of my friends to take pictures
of her when she gets off work.
So she needs a ride.
You know, that's why she called.
- Yo, can you drive?
- I don't care. I'll drive.
The others be here in a minute,
so's my uncle can drop 'em off
on the way to work.

Floatin'up shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the "D"
You the new kid on the block

Fuckin' Nazi
Your squad ain't your type
Take some real advice
And form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you
You better use it
This guy's a hillbilly
This ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash, I'll choke you
to your last breath
And have you look foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit
I know why they call you that
'Cause you follow Future
Like he got carrots
up his ass crack
And when you acted up
That's when you got
jacked up and act stupid
Like Tina Turner

I crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard
That Elvis'll start
turnin' in his grave
- [Laughing, Groaning]
- Now I know why they left you
out in the dark
Take your white ass back across 8 Mile

[Guitar]
[Eminem]
Look.
If you had one shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything
you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Orjust let it slip
Yo, his palms are sweaty
Knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already
mom's spaghetti
He's nervous but on the surface
he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on
forgetting what he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but
the words won't come out
He's chokin'how
Everybody's jokin'now
The clock's run out
Time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he
choked, he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy
No, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's
to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this
mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again
Yo, this whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment
And hope it don't pass him
Just melt in the music
The moment you want it
you better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime
Give it up
Just melt in the music
the moment you want it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not
miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
Once in a lifetime
Give it up
Soul's escaping, through
this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king
As we move toward a
New World Order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's
close to postmortem
It only grows harder
Homie grows hotter
He blows us all over
His ho's is all on him
Coast-to-coast shows, he's
known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes
home and barely knows
his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause
here goes the cold water
His ho's don't want him
no mo' he's cold product
And they moved on
to the next schmo who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada
And so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds
I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Dah-da-dum, da-dum da-dah
Lose yourself in the music
The moment you want it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime
Lose yourself in the music
The moment you want it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime
Give it up
No more games
I'm gonna change
What you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin'roof off
Like two dogs caged
I was playin'in the beginning
The mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out
and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin'
and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's
payin'the pied piper
All the pain inside
amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by
with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide
the right type of
Life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn
food stamps
Don't buy diapers
And it's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life
and these times are so hard
And it's gettin'even harder
Tryin'to feed and water
my seed plus
Teeter-totter caught up
between bein'a father
and a prima donna
Baby momma drama screamin'
on her too much for me
to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot
or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only
motherfuckin'option
Failure's not
Mom, I love you but
this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old
in Salem's Lot, so here I go
It's my shot
Feet fail me not
This may be the only
opportunity that I got
You better
Lose yourself in the music
The moment you want it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes
once in a lifetime
Give it up
Lose yourself in the music
The moment you want it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity
comes once in a lifetime
Move it up
You can do anything
you set your mind to, man.
