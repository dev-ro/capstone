Three, four, five and six.
- Don't hurry like that.
I don't want any mistakes
made with my money.
If you make mistakes with my money,
i'll take my business elsewhere.
Wouldn't like that, would
you, dearie? No, ma'am.
What are you smiling at me
like that for, young man?
I don't believe i know you.
No, ma'am. But whenever
i see money, i smile that way.
You got a nice
smile too, miss.
I'd like to withdraw my entire
account. Your entire account?
Yes, ma'am, the whole thing. And your name?
John-
john dillinger.
All right, everybody!
Hold it right where you are!
This is a robbery!
Charlie, get that back vault!
Harry,
clear off the counters.
- Watch 'em, homer. Watch 'em!
- Let go!
On your stomachs, now!
When i say it,
i mean it! Now!
You, miss, turn over! This ain't
no board of directors meeting!
Get in there.
Don't nobody get nervous!
Ain't got
nothin' to fear.
You're being robbed by the john
dillinger gang, that's the best there is.
These few dollars
you lose here today,
they're gonna buy you stories to
tell your children and grandchildren.
This could be one of the
big moments in your life.
Don't make it your last.

On june 17, 1933,
in kansas city,
five of my finest men
were ambushed...
escorting convicted bank robber frank
nash to the federal penitentiary.
My men died
like dogs in the gutter.
And i swore
personal vengeance.
Mr. Hoover told me he wanted these
rats that did it exterminated.
And that was my only job.
Charles arthur
"pretty boy" floyd.
George "machine gun" kelly.
Lester "baby face" nelson.
Wilbur underhill,
the trl-state terror.
Handsome jack klutas.
And, of course,
john dillinger.
Homer van meter,
henry pierpont,
charlie mackley,
the old man.
That's
the dillinger gang.
Course, there are others, but
those four are the ones who'll stay.
Can't touch dillinger.
No federal offense.
He doesn't deserve
to be there.
I don't anybody up there
i can't legally shoot.
Shoot dillinger, and we'll
figure out a way to make it legal.
Okay!
Want a cigar, sam? No,
they're not good for you.
I like a monte cristo. They're wonderful.
I don't smoke these all
the time.
They cost a half-dollar
apiece.
Well, i hope not.
You know who gave me these cigars? No.
Ray caffrey give 'em to me, just before
he got his head blown off in kansas city.
They were for my birthday.
And i intend
to smoke one of these...
over each of those men's
dead bodies.
I ain't crazy, johnny.
There was a fat little bank
here back in '25.
The whole county was rich.
Everything was here in '25,
weren't it, charley?
Shut up, eddie. You're
paid to drive the car.
Charley mackley's robbed more banks
than you'll ever see in your life.
So shut up
and drive the car!
Hi, there.
I said, hi, there!
- I heard you the first time.
- Oh, you did, huh?
You work here? Uh-uhh, i sure
ain't in it for the pleasure.
Nice, fella.
When the bank
close down?
Uh-uhh, when they run out
of money, what do you think?
Everything just up
and disappeared, huh?
What do you want
to know for?
Well,
me and these here...
friends of mine are
on a three-state crime spree.
That's so?
Yeah.
'Cept we can't find no
banks. That breaks my heart.
This is turnin'
into a radio show.
Worse yet, we're runnin' out
of gas looking for one.
Now, you fill that car up,
you understand?
Fill it yourself.
I said, fill it up.
Oh, what you gonna
do now, homer?
Can't do that.
Do somethin'! What are you doin'? Huh? Huh?
This son
- this son of a bitch is crazy.
Just give him some money,
and let's get out of here.
He's gonna do it.
Here. I don't want
your damned gas anyway.
What did you give him the money for,
homer? He's payin' him for the water.
Son of a bitch.
Step on it.
I got his gum ball machine.
Step on it, eddie!
- Who do you think i look like?
- Well, you look like...
douglas fairbanks,
as a matter of fact.
Now, can i have my drink back?
They don't serve indians in here.
You said you was an
indian. I'm half indian.
The other side is french,
and that side drinks.
Hey, you!
Who do you think you are, anyhow? Gone.
I'm douglas fairbanks. Sure as you're
standing there. That's who i am.
Okay. You're
douglas fairbanks.
You don't know who
in the hell i am, do you?
Look, pal. You can
be whoever you want.
As far as i'm concerned
you're douglas fairbanks. Who?
Douglas fairbanks.
Wrong!
I'm john dillinger!
Sure you are.
Stand up here.
Put it up here!
I'm john dillinger!
Now, stand up here,
and put your money on the bar!
Come on!
Get it up here!
I don't like
waiting around, you know?
Come on, miss!
Get up here!
Dump it out! Now get
over there on the floor.
- Uh, you want me to get down?
- Shut up!
Don't you ever do nothin'?
Can't you listen?
- What's your name?
- Billie- billie frechette.
- You gonna come with me.
- Whatever you say.
Get down! Get down there and
get that money off the bar.
All of ya. Look at my
face, you sons of bitches.
You're gonna
remember this face.
I'm john dillinger.
You're gonna be pickin' up your newspaper
tomorrow, and you're gonna be readin' it.
And you're
gonna see my face.
I'm john dillinger.
And i don't want you
to ever forget it.
Gimme that money.
Thanks.
I won $10. give it-
this here
is harry pierpont.
Homer van meter.
Charley mackley.
That's eddie.
He's the driver.
Thieves and killers.
You heard of 'em? Sure!
This is billie frechette. She's an
injun. Don't ever give her a drink.
That's some dish.
Douglas fairbanks, huh?
Now you stay there.
Is that clear?
That clear?
Yeah.
That indian's
got beautiful legs.
Yeah, i like 'em fine.
Whew, well i don't care
what they look like.
John picks up some broad in
the street, brings her up here.
I don't know
who she is.
I don't like it,
and i don't trust it.
Easy for you to talk.
You've got mary with you.
What's a man
supposed to do, huh?
I rob banks for a livin'.
What do you do?
Dillinger makes a fool
of himself over broads.
Treats 'em
like movie stars.
I don't trust a man who makes
a fool of himself over women.
He's a fool for love.
Dealer takes three.
Don't give me that dime-a-dance
crap, you're a whore.
Don't call me that. Nobody's gonna look
down on you for something like that.
Whorin's the oldest
profession in the world.
There were whores before
there were bank robbers.
There's nothing to be ashamed
about if you get the right price.
Don't do that again. What?
Whore? Don't call me that then.
Bitch!
You see what i mean,
huh? Huh?
No discipline. He lets
himself go too easily.
I don't trust it.
One of these days a
broad's gonna let him down.
A broad
always does.
John dillinger was still
out of my jurisdiction.
I'd get my chance at him, but there were
plenty of other public rats on the federal list,
and they had
to be cleared out first.
One of these
was wilbur underhill,
also known
as the trl-state terror.
He'd gotten married in illinois
the previous night...
and was enjoying his honeymoon
holed up in an abandoned farmhouse...
surrounded by state police
and federal agents.
I arrived late,
but had the intentions...
of delivering
my wedding present personally.
Hi, sam.
Sir.
How long
since you seen him?
Well, he shot two state cops
about a half hour ago.
We fired for 15 minutes straight.
Put 2,000 rounds in there.
What about the girl?
She's in there.
She's got
to be dead too.
Vest.
What? Vest. Get me a vest.
Gloves.
Automatic.
I can't get to my cigar.
Hey, willie, come on!
Let's go look!
Okay, great, chief.
Oh, my god. Look at her.
That was the most courageous
thing i've ever seen in my life.
It's guts. Sheer guts.
How did the broad get it?
He did it.
Couldn't go without her.
That makes another
one for you, mr. Purvis.
J. Edgar hoover will get another
feather in his hat. Another scalp.
My cigar's gone out.
Well, if nothing
gets in our way,
we'll be in tucson
by tuesday night.
Now get all the rooms in one
hotel but on different floors.
Have billie check in an hour
later and the rest the next day.
We come in together, it's
gonna look like a convention.
- What's wrong with her?
- She isn't going.
She wants to go back to her
mother up on the injun reservation.
Well, what the hell's the matter
with her? Now that's all i need.
Billie.
Billie look at me.
Come on.
Look at harry.
So you had a fight, huh?
Huh?
Mary and i have fights. She ain't goin'.
Does john know that?
No.
Well, i ain't
gonna tell him.
Well, go on and
get out of here.
I got a bank to rob.
How do i look?
Oh, you look gorgeous.
Be careful, harry, huh?
Get outta here.
Let's make
a little withdrawal.
Let's hit it.
Hey, billy, wait for me.
Just stay
where you are, eddie.
Oh, jesus god.
We're in trouble.
Stay calm, eddie. They'll
be out. Come on. Come on!
Hold on, eddie.
Jesus, harry, let's go.
Goddamn it!
Come on, eddie.
Move it. Let's go.
Look out!
Goddamn it! Come on! Johnny!
Charley's hit! Shot all to
hell! I'm okay. I'm okay.
Hang on! Get the police! Get the police!
Somebody get the police!
Hey, just take it easy.
Eddie, watch it!
Eddie, get over here,
you stupid son of a bitch!
Come on, harry!
Get down! Get down!
Scram, john!
Forget him!
Johnny!
Dillinger killed his first man
in east chicago-
a bank guard named o'malley,
and from now on,
there was no turning back.
His gang split up and fled west
to lick their wounds.
And as of yet, they had
committed no federal crime.
But i knew then that
i'd get him sooner or later.
I had the time.
Time was one thing
i had plenty of.
When you bury me, johnny,
put a name with me.
I don't just want to...
go under without no name.
Bullet went right through
your stomach, charley.
It hit a bone, you'd
really be in trouble.
I don't just want
to go under with no name.
Come on.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
I put no name
on this grave because...
charley mackley
was a well-known man.
His name
was like that of, uh,
butch cassidy, sam bass,
cole younger,
jesse james.
I put a name
on this grave,
some old coot would
come along some day...
and they'd just dig up
old charley's bones...
and sell 'em
to the tourists.
That's why there
ain't no name on this grave.
He's just an old man,
alone...
under the ground.
Amen.
The next big break
i had was in memphis.
George "machine gun" kelly.
A small-time hood and petty bank robber
who had risen to national prominence...
for his part
in the urschel kidnapping.
He was important to me because
he had a name everyone knew.
Even if he didn't deserve it.
And what's more,
he gave us a name that day...
that became
part of the language.
Don't do it!
Don't shoot g-men, please!
Please, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot, g-men!
You george kelly? Yeah, i'm
kelly. Please, don't do it, g-man!
Purvis, f.b.i.
G-men, huh?
I like that.
Government man.
Mr. Hoover's
gonna like that too.
G-men.
See that out there?
Where? It's all desert to me.
No, there's a town out there.
Just about the horizon.
That right there, that's mexico.
Mexico-
it's just waiting.
Yep.
All my life i wanted
to be a bank robber.
Carry a gun.
Wear a mask.
Now that it's happened,
i guess i'm just about...
the best bank robber
they ever had.
And i sure am happy.
Is that what you wanted to
be when you were a kid? Yep.
My buddies wanted to be firemen or
farmers or policemen, something like that.
Not me. I just wanted
to steal people's money.
I bet you wanted to have your
picture in every post office too.
Sure did.
All we've got to do, billie,
is drive down that road.
We got $70,000
in the back.
You could do it
if you wanted to, johnny.
All the way to guadalajara.
Live the rest of my life
like a pharaoh.
No, i couldn't do that.
Yeah. What would
your public think?
? i'm in love with you, honey?
? say you love me too, honey?
? no one else will do, honey?
? seems funny but it's true?
Handsome jack klutas,
a kidnapper and murderer,
ran with
the barker-corpus gang.
Had a college degree
and used to play football.
He was one of the most
vicious killers of his day.
I knew i'd never
take him alive.
I didn't try to hard,
neither.
F.b.i.
Uh, just for this picture
i wish you'd not smile.
Okay?
Uh, now-
all right, hold it.
Got a good one.
I collect 'em.
Nice place. Nice party. Nice folks.
¯ como estas, amigos?
And ay-ay-ay to ya.
Gentlemen, i'd like you to meet pearl.
- She sings at the golden sombrero.
- Hiya, pearl.
Hi.
Show business, huh?
I'll bet you have
a glamorous life.
- This is art long.
- Hello.
That's sam phillips.
Hello.
I do business with them
occasionally. Mm-hm.
Oh, i'm sorry. That's their
wives, trixie and angel.
You kind of look like
dillinger, mr. Long.
- Did anybody
ever tell you that?
Oh, no, you mean john
dillinger, the criminal?
Uh-huh. Some folks think i
look like douglas fairbanks.
I like dillinger better.
He does look like him. I've
told him that a thousand times.
You know john, with charley and eddie gone,
we're gonna need
someone else.
I ain't never seen a bank the
three of us couldn't rob, have you?
You startin' to believe that
stuff they put in the newspapers.
Don't you?
You say them fellas
give you this $100 bill...
to carry their valises
into the hotel, eh?
And they
was heavy, eh?
And that's them standin'
over there for sure?
Take the combination of them
fellas standin' over there...
and them shiny cars...
and them fancy-lookin' girls
means they's all criminals.
Why you say that? Decent
folk don't live that good.
Now you mosey on over there
and take a closer look.
Did you get
a good look at 'em?
Close as i am to you.
Him?
Nope.
Oh, my god!
I like that song.
Well,
don't look at me.
Want to dance?
You know how? Of course, i do. Kind of.
It's a 12-gauge,
mr. Dillinger.
I'm big jim wollard. I've
killed 35 men in my day,
and i wouldn't mind
if you were number 36.
So let's go, sonny.
St. Paul, baby.
St. Paul.
Is that him?
There he is!
I think he's
in the second car there.
Post arms!
You got a statement for us?
How ya feelin'?
Why ain't you wearin' a hat?
Are ya goin' collegiate?
Somebody stole my hat.
What do you think about
the president, johnny?
I like him. I like the new
deal, and i like the n.r.a.
I like especially the help he's
been giving the banks lately.
What about
social security?
Well, it could
ruin the country.
If people want money,
they ought to go to work.
Did you kill
patrolman o'malley?
I never killed anybody in
my life. I just steal money.
You been known to carry a gun and
use it. Well, it is dangerous work.
What do you think
of this jail?
Well, it's a nice place.
Nice people.
Ain't no jail
can hold me.
It's an exercise in
futility. Say that again?
It's an exercise
in futility.
What do you think of the d.a.?
I like him.
I like
the police commissioner too.
I think we're all gonna get
along fine here, don't you, ma'am?
How do you do? Put your
arm around him, mr. Estil.
We got
the second column again.
"Federal bureau of investigation
midwest chief melvin purvis...
"claims he'll have pretty
boy floyd within a month.
Commends texas ranger on
killing of bonnie and clyde."
Remind me to send that man a
box of cigars. You already did.
This sort of thing
isn't good, you know.
It isn't good at all. What kind of thing?
I mean this dillinger punk
gets all the headlines.
Thank you, dan.
We take second column. That kind
of thing's gonna have to change.
Make more personal
appearances when you can.
Talk to people. Let the
public know who you are.
This whole thing isn't
just catchin' these rats.
Well, that's all i want to do.
That's all the director wants.
Well, i don't mean to cast
aspersions on j. Edgar,
but he was never a man to shun
the public eye. Bang! Bang!
Hey, kid! Kid!
That's right, you.
What are you playin'?
Cops and robbers.
What are you the cop or the robber? Robber.
Oh, crime doesn't pay.
Bet your dad told you that.
- I ain't got no dad.
- Sorry to hear that.
Every kid should have a dad.
- You know who i am?
- No.
You really don't know who i am? No.
- I'm melvin purvis, the g-man.
- You ain't him.
Want to see my badge?
I bet you'd like to see my gun. Yeah.
I got to unload it.
Not that i don't trust you.
But if something happened,
i'd always think of you
when i looked at a little boy.
You got a little boy too? No, sir.
I'm like you.
I don't have anybody.
Here, hold it.
How's it feel?
Feels heavy.
When you grow up, it won't feel
heavy. You can have one just like it.
- You can have a badge too.
- Wouldn't want to be a g-man.
Why not? Have to go to
school to be a g-man.
Well, you got
to go to school!
John dillinger
don't go to school.
John dillinger's in jail!
Hi, boys.
Open up, friend.
That ain't real.
You want to lose the top
of your head findin' out?
Put that shotgun over there. Butt
first or i'll blow your throat out.
Unlock it. Don't look at it! Unlock it!
Step back a little.
Where'd you get that?
From my lawyer. What the
hell you think a lawyer's for?
Either of you boys married? I am.
All right, then get in
there. You're stayin'.
You eat this.
Let's go.
Goin' with us, jack?
No, too tired.
All right.
Why, evenin', mr. Dillinger.
Howdy. What's your name?
Reed youngblood.
You're in for murder, aren't ya? Yes, sir.
- Who'd you kill, reed?
- My wife and a bible salesman.
I caught 'em in
flagrante dilecto.
Let him out.
He's doin' it! The son of
a bitch is gonna make it!
More power to you, johnny.
John, open up these cells!
Take me with you,
dillinger! Break out, baby!
Keys.
All right, warden.
The garage.
They won't shoot me
to get you in here, johnny.
But i can't control those
national guard boys.
Don't you worry
about a thing.
Hell, warden, they'd
like to see me make it.
Get over here.
Get over here!
- Come out from under there.
- Can't you see i'm busy?
Haven't your got manners or sense
enough to know when a man is-
you better come out
from under there, cook.
I've seen you
in the newspapers!
You're him!
What's the fastest car
you got in here?
Mr. Drubb's car is the fastest, but mr.
Grieve's ford is the strongest on hills.
I'll take the sheriff's car. He won't care.
- He sure will!
- He's a friend of mine. Now get on over there.
Get behind that wheel before
i'll kill you. Yes, sir.
Get over there, warden.
You three!
I want you to get out there
and open up that garage door.
We're leavin' here
in two minutes.
I want everybody
out there at attention.
'Cause if they're not i'm gonna
cut the warden up like spaghetti.
You get that?
Yes, sir.
Tat, tat, tat.
Give me a good head start,
boy. It'll be more sportin'.
Now, nobody even think
of making a quick move.
They got
innocent men in them cars.
[Siren continues [we'll get
dillinger. I'll guarantee you that!
You just hold still! Hold still,
you hear me! Now we'll get him!
Let's go!
Hold it. Pull up here.
I want to go in that bank.
I never seen a man
with such gall!
Back down that alley.
Shh. Hold it!
Whatever you're doing,
ladies and gentlemen, stop!
This is a robbery.
I'm john dillinger,
most recently on display
down at your local jail.
Don't be nervous. Don't
do anything you'll regret.
This is going to be one of
the big days in your life.
Don't make it your last.
Sack it up, honey.
You know what you can get for
this, don't you, youngblood?
I'm already a murderer.
Ha, so i might
as well be famous.
? [continues
slow this down,
will you?
Tryin' to get us
all killed?
30 or 40 miles per hour
is plenty fast.
One thing i got is time. Time
is one thing i got plenty of.
Depression?
I ain't never heard of it.
- What are you doin' there?
- I'm splittin' up. This is where we part company.
What are you
splitting it up for?
Well, i get
the most because, uh,
i'm the one
with the most experience.
Reed here gets more
'cause he's a con.
You boys are doin' all right. There's more
than $300 apiece for you here. How's that?
- You gotta be crazy!
- I ain't never seen such gall.
Do you think i'd take that
money? I'm sorry, fellas.
I'd split it up better,
but i ain't got much time.
I ain't no fool. You're
not gonna keep that money?
I did the drivin'!
Well-
depression.
Things are hard.
- Yeah, hard times.
- Hard times.
- Hard times.
- Hard times.
Reed, i'd take you with me,
but you ain't a pro.
I understand,
mr. Dillinger.
I'll make it
up to you.
I'll send you something
for christmas. All right.
He'll never live to see
christmas. I hope he does.
What about you?
Want to come back with us?
Get you off
of death row.
Whoo!
Mr. Dillinger!
Mr. Dillinger!
I don't care if i do die.
I want to die with you,
mr. Dillinger!
I want to be a bank robber
like you, mr. Dillinger!
I don't want to be
there when they get you.
Promise me that i won't have
to be there when they get you.
They're not
going to get me.
I just don't
want to see it.
I just don't want
to see it, johnny.
They won't ever get me.
I may not live forever,
but i'd be
a damned fool not to try.
Hello, melvin?
Yes, hello.
This is john dillinger. Well
now, how are you, johnny?
I always
felt that, uh-
well, i always felt
that we ought to...
talk occasionally.
Good good.
I'd like
to hear from you.
I understand
that, uh-
i understand
that you've been, uh-
you got me on a driving a stolen
car across state line, is that right?
Federal offense.
It's what the paper said.
That's right, kid. Not much
for a man of your ability.
How'd you like the crash
out? Liked it fine, johnny.
Yeah! It was
great, wasn't it!
I've always wanted it that
way. Gives me a chance-
how many men you got on me
now, melvin? Two, johnny.
Two good ones.
You and j. Edgar hoover, huh?
That's right, kid.
Well that's fine.
That's fine, melvin.
I like a man
with confidence.
Call whenever you like. Sure
been nice talkin' to you.
You can reverse the
charges if you need, kid.
Bye!
Son of a bitch.
What did he sound like?
Who?
Melvin purvis.
Don't you ever mention
that name again.
Hello, daddy.
Hello, johnny.
How you been?
All right.
Dad, this is billie.
It's a pleasure, billie.
Johnny, i never thought
well of what you've done.
I still don't think it's
right to break the law.
But times
being what they are,
and if all these people
think so highly of you,
welcome home, son.
I think that's them,
reed. Boy, that's some car.
Hi, billie.
Hi, harry.
Nice day.
Reed!
Mr. Dillinger,
how are ya?
How ya been?
John, you took so long, i didn't
think you were gonna get here.
Yeah, everybody here? Good
to see you, too, miss billie.
How are you, reed?
Fine.
Yeah, they're all right
here. What are we having?
Oh, what are we having? What
are we having, homer, chicken?
I don't know. We brought the potato salad.
Hi, homer.
Hi, mary.
Mary. Here. Let me get this for you.
I don't believe you two gentlemen
have met. John dillinger-
chuck floyd. Pleased to
meet you, mr. Dillinger.
My pleasure, floyd. I've always
been a great admirer of yours.
Well, you ain't
no punk yourself.
What chased you out of
cookson hills, floyd?
A lot of things. They was gettin'
on my folks and it was hard on 'em.
Then bonnie and clyde ran through
there. Weren't safe for no one.
Bunch of mad dogs,
that's what they were.
- I ain't sorry to see 'em go.
- Well,
small-timers get into it
and ruin it for everybody.
Uh, you wanna cut out this
mutual admiration society?
Wanna get a couple
of things clear.
Lester nelson,
john dillinger.
Nelson.
Baby face nelson, huh?
I don't like
to be called that.
Well, i'll try
to remember that.
One thing
- if we're gonna work together,
i want it understood that
i don't take no orders.
This is
mr. Dillinger's gang.
Ah! He ain't my leader. I got
my own way of taking banks.
I come in shooting, i kill
everyone in sight, i grab the dough.
Very easy. Works very well. You
don't like it, you get somebody else.
I'll tell you what.
Let's you and me go out
there and talk about that.
Anything you want, buster.
Lester.
Shut up.
Reed.
Have some chicken.
There's one thing you gotta learn, kid
- yeah?
You wanna kill me?
You wanna kill me, punk?
You can't kill me, punk!
Get up! Get up!
Stop it.
Get up!
Punk!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone! Leave me
alone! You little punk!
I'm immortal, punk!
Here. Take it,
punk. Take it. L-l-l-
pull the trigger!
You can't do it!
You can't do it,
can ya?
I'm immortal, you punk!
I'm dillinger!
Come on, harry!
Let's go!
Who set
that alarm?
Who set
that alarm?
I'm gonna kill
whoever did that!
I don't care if i gotta
kill you... or you.
Just so long as i get
to kill somebody.
Hey, there's law outside.
Where? Where? Get out of the way.
I got him! I got him!
Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, what would you want if i
had all the money in the world?
There's nothing
i really want, johnny,
except maybe-
maybe what?
Maybe go dancing again
with you.
Yeah, that's
what i'd want.
All right. If that's what you
want, that's what you'll have.
We'll go to chicago and we'll go
dancing at the flamingo club tonight.
Yeah.
You can't go to chicago.
Well, if i can go there to rob banks,
i can go there to dance with my girl.
Can't i, huh?
Huh? Huh?
Ah, very good.
Thank you.
I'd like to take
this occasion...
to toast the most beautiful
woman in the whole world.
Is everything all right,
honey? Everything's fine, dear.
Champagne makes me dizzy
when i drink it too fast.
It's the bubbles.
Garcon. Garcon.
I think we should have
the roast leg of lamb.
It's the most expensive thing on the menu.
Far table over there.
Magnum.
You sweet thing you.
A friend sends
his regards, monsieur.
Take it away.
Monsieur-
get it out of here.
I knew sooner or later
they'd make a mistake.
It came
in mason city, iowa.
A fast-thinking local sheriff spotted
homer van meter by a car outside the bank.
Within minutes, they were
armed, ready and waiting.
It's bulletproof,
you bastards!
The roof. The roof. We
done walked into a trap.
Come on, baby!
Let's go! Let's go! They're out of
rounds! On the roof! On the roof!
Behind you, harry!
Behind you!
Oh, lord have mercy! What
we done got into here?
Hurry up, harry!
Get in the goddamn car!
Come on!
You can't touch me!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Get it out of here.
The car's here! Come on!
I'll cover you!
Get in the car! I gotta
do something about you.
You got the money.
Where you want it?
Dillinger! Come on!
I'll get you, boy.
Watch out, johnny.
Get rid of him.
Oh, god!
You'll be all right, boy.
Johnny?
He's okay. The doctor will
be up here in the morning.
Shot in the stomach.
It's okay.
What the hell's
all that crap?
Ain't there no place a man
can get a night's sleep?
Rich society punks.
Jesus.
I had those rats now.
They'd been hurt
at mason city.
They were tired
and beaten and off balance.
At last i was getting a chance
at something i'd dreamed of-
pretty boy floyd,
baby face nelson,
van meter,
pierpont and john dillinger,
all in one swoop.
I didn't call on the local authorities.
I couldn't take that chance.
It was ours or no one's.
Mr. Hoover wanted it that way.
We got lost twice
and one car broke down.
But towards dawn,
we closed on in.
This time,
i knew i had that boy.
Oh, god!
I wish to hell
he'd pass out again.
If he screams again like that, the
hunters downstairs are gonna call the cops.
What do you expect me to
do about it? Finish him!
Oh, god. You can't do
that. Leave the boy be.
He deserves a chance.
The man deserves a chance.
All right now, men. I'll take
the front entrance with you four.
Sam, you take the far side.
Ned, the rear.
Move in slow.
Now, we all know
who we're looking for.
Wait until first light.
I want positive
identification.
Otherwise, we'll be
shooting each other.
Let's go get 'em.
What the hell's going
on out here? Who's there?
I smell heat!
Get the second far window.
Goddamn it!
Shut up, goddamn it!
Over here, georgie. Yeah,
yeah. Give me another clip.
Get back in there.
I'll see you
in kansas city.
I need some help on this front window,
harry! Where the hell is pretty boy?
I got the ammo.
Let's go.
I got three cartons
in the trunk.
Homer, first floor.
Get down! Get down!
Come on! Come on!
Damn. It jammed.
Give me it.
Try again,
you son of a bitch.
Hang on.
Hang on me, baby.
Son of a bitch.
By the woodpile.
Four of 'em.
My foot!
I see 'em!
They shot your toe off.
Is that all?
I need some help here!
Just get out of here,
johnny! Get out of here!
I'll come back for you.
You don't have to say that.
I'll be back for you.
Whatever you say.
Come here, huh?
30.06.
Anybody got any 30.06?
Sorry about this, boy.
Eat it, g-man!
Get in! Nelson, let's
go! Homer, get in there!
Help me!
Run, johnny!
Run! Run!
Run! Run!
Stand against the wall. Don't
move again or you're dead, mister.
I don't know anything about it. I
thought they was all millionaires.
Dillinger's girl.
Can't you see the lady's foot's hurt?
Here, cowley.
Put your arm here.
You'll never get him.
Yes, i'll get him.
God, try
to stop bleeding.
Stop bleeding.
I can feel a bone.
It hurts.
Will you
shut him up?
Shut up yourself, you rat, or i'll
blow the back of your goddamn head off.
I've never been
hit bad before.
I gotta get
to k-kansas city.
Mary. Mary.
Oh, mary!
What's that?
What's up there?
I'm gettin' out.
I'm gettin' out.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I'm already hit-
mary!
Oh!
Harry! Harry!
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn it. Things ain't
workin' out for me today.
Oh, this is so wicked.
No. No, you mustn't.
I've never let anyone.
One more kiss. What's a kiss? No.
No. I mean it, leroy.
I'm going in, leroy. I can't
stand it. This is wrong.
Not a sound, leroy.
Now, start this thing up.
Let's see how fast she'll go.
How are you, ma'am?
I'm kinda lost.
Can't find the main road.
I'm kinda hungry too.
I need food
and that jalopy out back.
I can pay you for it.
You're one of them,
ain't ya?
Yes, ma'am.
What about the car, ma'am?
Hell, boy,
it ain't run since '29.
I don't want
no trouble.
Come on in, boy.
Ah. Boola-boola.
You play football,
leroy?
Sure. Varsity. Oh,
that's good. That's good.
What position?
End. Uh, left end.
Oh, yeah?
I was a center.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
For who?
State pen.
You don't look big enough to be a center.
I was big enough. Don't you
worry about it. You just drive.
Hey, leroy, did you ever
hear the barbershop yell?
? hit 'em on the chin scrape 'em
on the jaw leave 'em, leave 'em?
? rah, rah, rah?
? on wisconsin?
What is it?
Gas. It must be gas.
Something must be wrong
with the gauge.
You better be right, you
little son of a bitch.
Dry. Bone dry. Must be
something wrong with the gauge.
You better be right, boy. Get your
ass over there. See for yourself.
You son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch.
Oh, god, things ain't
workin' out for me.
Just a bunch
of goddamn farmers.
Oh. Oh!
Son of a bitch.
I want help!
Help me, somebody!
Goddamn it.
Things ain't
workin' out for me.
I've been shot in the lungs.
Will you get a doctor? Please?
Please?
You need a bible?
I've sinned.
I have been a sinner,
but i enjoyed it.
And i killed men,
but the dirty
sons of bitches deserved it.
No matter how i figure it,
it's too late for no bible.
Thank you
just the same, ma'am.
There he goes.
Halt.
Aim.
Fire!
Are you
pretty boy floyd?
I'm charles arthur floyd.
This is
for kansas city, boy.
I wasn't in on that.
I swear.
Shouldn't be lying when
you're so close to your maker.
- You- you must be purvis.
- That's right.
I'm glad it was you.
Ace federal
agent melvin purvis...
has turned the debacle at little bohemia
into a gang-smasher's turkey shoot.
Baby face nelson, pretty
boy floyd, harry pierpont.
But where is the leader,
public enemy number one,
john dillinger?
John dillinger
is believed to be-
johnny!
Are you comfortable?
Yes, yes. This is fine.
My name is anna sage.
I'm a prostitute, a madam.
I run a house
of prostitution.
You probably know
already this, don't you?
That doesn't matter,
anna.
Would you like a popsicle? No, thank you.
Popsicle sure is refreshing. No, thank you.
Go on.
I'm a alien.
I have a criminal record.
I run a good house. Many
city officials are my clients.
I could make it hot for some of
them if they try and deport me.
No one wants to do that,
not if you help me. Go on.
About a month ago,
almost a month,
maybe more,
a man came to board
in my apartment.
I have to take in boarders
occasionally.
He said his name
was john lawrence,
that he worked for
the chicago board of trade.
Uh, he was hiding
from his wife, divorced.
She was after him
for alimony.
They all say that. They just
want to get around my girls.
You say this was
about a month ago?
About a month, yes.
That's right.
He, uh, took up
with polly.
That's, uh, polly hamilton,
one of my new girls.
Polly?
Polly.
- He says she looks like an indian.
- An indian?
That's silly. She's just an ordinary girl.
An indian.
Isn't that something?
He take us to the movies,
both of us.
That's when
i found out he...
was dillinger.
I see him
in the newsreel.
I knew it, despite the hair, the mustache.
L- i asked him.
Did he tell you
he was dillinger?
He's a nice fellow.
I don't believe he ever killed
anyone. He couldn't have.
You won't harm him
if you can help it?
No, of course not.
I've grown rather fond of him
myself in a strange sort of way.
You won't harm him, will
you? Please don't do that.
I wouldn't want harm
to come to him.
I wouldn't have done this if
it wasn't for my situation.
You understand, don't
you? Certainly, certainly.
He likes to go to movies.
Are you sure
you don't want a popsicle?
I'll take a red one.
So if i get a spot on my dress,
it won't show off too bad.
Good and red.
Goes well with your hair.
Manhattan melodrama is on
now starring clark gable.
It's been running about 25
minutes. That'll be all right.
I just wanna see
the end. Two.
No, i don't like it at
all. Those are hoods.
Well, they don't dress like
- take it from me. And i've been running this place since 1925.
I know hoods.
Call the police.
Stay out of this. F.b.i. Yes, sir.
Just calm down. There's
nothing to worry about.
Those men are all federal
agents like myself.
Is there
gonna be shooting?
No one's gonna get hurt. That's
melvin purvis. Who's in here anyway?
Just keep
to yourself.
I want hoover
in washington directly.
Tell him we have reason to believe that
dillinger is in the biograph theater...
and that i'm taking appropriate
action without aid of local police.
This one
is ours alone.
We'll try to take him inside
the theater or outside,
whichever one presents the
least risk to bystanders.
Tell him this time
i'm going to get him.
All right now, men.
This is it.
Some of you were in law school
when i started chasing this one.
So let's do it
and do it right.
Pistols only. We can't touch him
in there. There's too many people.
Now, when he comes out of there,
he'll be with a woman dressed in red.
When i make
positive identification,
i'll light my cigar.
Woman in red, lit cigar.
That's your man.
Remember,
wait for my cigar.
Is that clear?
Johnny!
Get the police!
Get the police!
What's going on here?
Oh! Mr. Dillinger!
Break it up!
Break it up!
Closed-captioned by
captions, inc. Los angeles
dillinger was a rat...
that the country may consider
itself fortunate to be rid of,
and i don't sanction any hollywood
glamorization of these vermin.
This type
of romantic mendacity...
can only lead young people
further astray...
than they are already.
And i want no part of it.
