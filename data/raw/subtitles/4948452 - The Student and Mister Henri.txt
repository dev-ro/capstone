- Hello.
- How are you, Mr Voizot?
THE STUDENT AND MR HENRI
Relax, it'll go just fine.
You drive really well.
Hello.
Can you start the car?
Pull out into the street.
Thank you.
Turn right here.
You turned left.
Sorry!
Keep straight on.
Your first test?
My firm.
I wanted courgettes.
Sorry.
Your fifth failure
and it costs a bomb!
Stop going on about it.
How did I get such a
useless daughter?
I give up, I'll never pass.
How'll you drive the van?
I won't run the stall, Dad!
I won't need to drive in Paris.
Fail your exams and you'll be back.
I'll pass. I'm one credit short.
You screwed up in June.
How'll you pass in September
after wasting the summer?
I'll pass to piss you off.
Don't count on us to fund you.
I never asked you to!
All right...
I guess I'll take the carrots.
- Yes?
- A kilo of endives.
Hello.
I'm Constance.
I don't know a Constance.
Wrong door.
You again?
Sorry, are you Mr Henri Voizot?
Why? Are you a police officer?
No, I'm a student.
Constance Piponnier.
Your son didn't say?
No, but it's nothing personal.
I forget everything.
It's old age.
Madam.
I don't believe it!
It's not very polite,
slamming the door on me.
I thought we'd finished.
Didn't you post an ad
for a room?
- I didn't, my son did.
- There!
He arranged for us to meet.
Maybe he did...
Sorry,
but I've come a long way.
If the room is free,
I'd love to see it.
May I?
For few minutes then.
But wipe your feet first.
You won't dirty the place.
You've cleaned?
Why the questions?
Did I ask if you've washed today?
I washed this morning.
Glad to hear it.
You have a piano.
- No one touches it.
- No problem.
I've given it up.
All right, follow me.
Have you been here long?
Since God knows when.
Must be quite a while then.
I never enter this room.
Maybe it's full of cockroaches.
This is it.
It's not that bad,
It has a "roots" side.
"Roots"?
An expression.
Kind of rock'n'roll. See?
Not really.
The wallpaper...
Never changed.
And the carpet...
It used to be carpet.
Now it's more like a dog's blanket.
And not a very fussy dog.
It'll be fine with a rug.
And a bathroom?
The tap's broken.
Don't feel obliged.
I can see you don't like it.
Goodbye, miss.
A nice, clear view of the trees.
That's a cemetery.
It's a grim view.
Not at all.
Greenery is a rare thing in Paris.
Come on, I'll show you out.
About the rent...
What your son said
in his message?
What did he say?
200 euros.
He said that?
250.
I thought so.
It's pretty cheap.
Your memory's not totally gone.
I just hate being ripped off.
Pretty washbasins.
My wife chose them.
Is she dead?
Deceased, I mean.
None of your business.
It's really clean anyhow.
The water heater
broke down 5 years ago.
5 years of cold showers?
It's "roots".
Mediaeval, more like.
On the contrary, it's the future.
It saves energy and water too.
A cold shower is always shorter.
No kidding.
I wouldn't even take a shower.
Wimp.
You've never known war.
No, I haven't.
I'll think it over.
The water's hot!
You lie to make tenants see.
It was a test.
I won't share with someone
who doesn't shower.
Hygiene matters.
All right, I'll take the room.
Hold on...
There's a questionnaire
to answer first.
So...
"Are you a smoker?"
No, I'm not.
A disqualifier.
"Do you have a pet?"
No.
Another disqualifier.
My tortoise hates other animals.
You have a tortoise?
Can I see it?
No, do the questionnaire.
"Do you have a boyfriend?"
I can't have one?
Not here in any case.
I don't want to see you
cuddling some moron your age,
whispering sweet nothings.
So no boys?
No, nobody.
And no idiotic parents either!
Very convivial.
A community requires rules.
A community?
There are only two of us...
Two is one too many.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, madam.
Good luck.
Why are these people here?
It's about the room.
Come in then.
Wipe your feet first!
Thank you.
How big is it?
90 square feet, like the ad said.
- A sofa bed?
- A foldout single.
I'm interested. Here's my file.
The bathroom's across the landing.
Great. Thank you.
Goodbye.
They'll be back soon.
Get dressed.
Scared I'll befriend your daughter?
Don't talk rubbish. Hurry.
I have to stop working out,
my jeans don't fit.
Henri Voizot speaking.
The room's yours.
You chose me!
I didn't, I just drew a name.
Every application was pitiful.
Fate has never helped me out before.
Fate is a pile of shit.
I have a room in Paris.
That's fantastic!
Well done.
You don't care I'm leaving.
We always knew
it'd end like this, right?
I guess.
Of course.
Hurry up now.
Here we are...
Some small change
Dad didn't take to the bank.
Mum, I don't believe it!
I'll find a job.
Some chocolates for Mr Voizot.
Thanks, Mum.
No tears, ok, or I'll start too!
Hurry up and leave then.
Hello.
All that?
I'll have to put the rent up.
I'm a girl, remember.
Anything left in the living room
goes in the bin.
- Not clothes?
- Anything!
You can't do that.
You bet I can, it's my place.
You've been warned.
By the way,
here are the house rules.
- What's this?
- For you.
There are 20 pages!
It's a summary.
Are you ex-army?
Not at all.
I was an accountant.
Funny.
Not really.
It's funny because
I'm always overdrawn.
That looks good for the rent.
Yes, she arrived this morning.
Paul, I can take my medication
on my own.
No, I can't this Sunday.
No, it's not because of Valérie.
Why do you have to be so touchy?
All right, good night.
You listened to all that.
No.
But I overheard a little.
I need a housemate,
not a shit-stirrer.
I'd rather tell you right away...
My son is a moron.
A moron married to an idiot.
She doesn't have all her marbles.
She failed every exam.
Maybe it's not stupidity,
but just nerves.
She can't read a road map.
She gets lost in a minimart!
She wants to have kids too.
My grandkids will have the IQ
of a goldfish!
That's harsh.
She wants to put me
in an old folks' home!
I'll show her!
You'll see one day.
When your kids marry and you
end up hating... their spouses.
What?
Spouses... The ones they marry.
Spouse is a pretty ugly word.
It suits her to a T.
No one touches that piano.
I didn't touch it.
I lock it for the fun of it?
I was just looking at it.
You lie as well.
I'm old, not deaf.
I think I'll let you go.
I won't touch it again, promise.
Look, we'll lock it and...
you keep the key.
That way...
No, I don't trust you.
You still owe me your rent.
I'll pay it now, right away.
The thing is...
your parents haven't vouched for you.
That means
a two-month deposit
on top of the first month's rent.
That makes 750 euros.
Wm at?
I can't give you that right away.
If you can't pay,
you'll have to leave.
It's ok, but...
I need a little time.
In the meantime
I can help you out a lot.
I don't need anything.
Then again...
Maybe there is something.
In relation to my son and his spouse.
Could you...
Could I what?
I'm not a whore.
It's not that!
Just show my son new horizons.
I can't break up a marriage.
It's a sort of test.
Set his head spinning a little.
Either he gently rejects you,
proving his marriage is solid,
or...
It's best if it ends fast.
A man can sleep with me
and keep his wife.
A normal man, yes.
But my son is extremely inhibited.
He's had no other women
apart from Valérie.
He thinks he can't do
better than her.
The thing is,
if a pretty girl like you
finds him attractive...
What if it goes wrong?
My son has many flaws,
but he's a gentleman.
You won't find him at all attractive.
As a boy,
he was cute but...
he's gone downhill.
I always say,
"After 40, we're responsible
for the way we look."
If I refuse, I'm out?
It's not my fault
you can't pay your rent.
But, if you accept,
we forget the deposit
and you get three months free.
Fair's fair.
Six months.
- Three.
- No, six.
- Four months.
- Six.
You're pretty venal.
I'm pretty overdrawn actually.
Waitress needed
Good evening.
A shot of vodka, please.
Three.
Great.
Feeling better?
Need a waitress?
Yeah.
The sign is misleading.
You'll have to do dishes,
wash floors,
plus it's poorly paid.
I'm interested.
Come in tomorrow
to meet the boss.
Cool.
This one's on me.
That's kind.
Going travelling?
Yeah, maybe.
They won't hire a lush.
It's ok, never while I'm working.
See you tomorrow.
Thanks.
Bye.
Hello.
- Henri's son?
- Exactly.
You can call me Paul.
- Constance. Delighted.
- Likewise.
Sorry, I'm in my pyjamas.
My fault,
I turn up unannounced...
Coffee?
Yes, why not?
How did you know me?
I don't resemble my father.
He spoke about you.
He was obnoxious?
He was, I know him.
He went to town.
He said I was a jerk?
No, not a jerk.
That I was gloomy?
A moron?
A gloomy moron?
Surely he wasn't nice?
Not nice, no.
No, that's not his style.
I think I know.
He said I was ugly
despite being cute as a boy.
Exactly.
His very words.
Ok. And on seeing me,
you thought, "He's not that ugly."
Sorry.
It's not a problem.
I'd rather be
less ugly than expected.
Did he say I was ugly?
Not at all.
He said, "Ordinary."
Nice.
Do you agree?
You seem normal.
Not ugly in any case.
You both know how to talk to women.
Wait!
Wait.
I wanted to see you.
Like I said,
my father's not entirely well.
He has trouble breathing,
especially lying down.
So, in return for the very low rent,
keep an eye on him.
Check his Ventolin
is on his bedside table at night
and give him his pills twice a day.
He can't be alone at night?
He can.
He isn't at death's door.
But not too often.
All right?
I have to get to work.
An accountant too?
Yes, the legacy was too
heavy to avoid.
My destiny, I suppose.
That pile of shit.
You know the family philosophy.
You don't like accountancy?
It's not what I dreamt of as a boy,
but as I had no real talents,
I reluctantly took over Dad's firm
when the time came.
Getting acquainted?
I was telling Constance
how I failed in life.
With Valérie?
No, with accountancy.
How ungrateful!
I pass my firm on to him
and he complains!
I'll go because...
Well?
Why are you here?
To see Constance in her pyjamas?
Quite small pyjamas actually!
You'll get used to his
sense of humour.
She's on probation.
I might not keep her.
He told me that all my childhood.
Come to lunch on Sunday.
We invited you and you refused.
I prefer to do lunch here.
Would you mind?
Not at all.
I could cook.
I'm not very gifted, but I can try.
She'll do anything to stay.
If she cooks like your wife,
she'll be out.
Dad, stop that right now.
It's what I think.
Not everyone likes that,
but I'm honest.
It's not honesty,
it's permanent humiliation.
He can't see I'm defending him!
You wear me out, that's all!
Goodbye, Constance.
Goodbye.
Bye, Dad.
Bye.
Put your scarf on.
Don't catch cold.
So, think he found you attractive?
I think he found you not bad.
What's more,
your pyjamas are perfect.
Wear them on Sunday.
I can find better.
No, they're perfect.
Go and get dressed now.
I'm warm.
Are you wearing my slippers?
Yes.
I didn't have any.
These are cute.
Don't mind me.
Dessert?
Seen the competition backpack?
Wild, huh?
Ventilated, rainproof,
10-year guarantee.
- Imagine that?
- Not really.
Can't you help outwith the tables?
Seen this, Audesh?
If you're going to do lunch
like you said,
get to work right away.
Come on, get up!
What a nightmare.
Get up!
All right!
By the way,
I've been thinking about your son.
You're right,
he seems a real tight-ass.
I beg your pardon?
A bit shy, if you prefer.
Yes, I prefer that.
Hello!
I'm Valérie.
You must be Constance.
Lovely.
Delighted to meet you at last.
Likewise.
Come in.
Isn't Henri here?
He's just getting ready.
Lovely.
I'm starving.
Mass made me peckish.
That holy wafer was like
an appetizer.
The body of Christ isn't
an appetizer.
I didn't say that.
I said it was like one.
I'll be in the kitchen.
I'm running late.
You've cooked lunch?
Lovely.
Wait to taste it...
The intention behind each act
is what matters most.
Paul told you not to make dessert?
Thank you.
No, a crumble needs heating up.
But for now?
The thermal shock will be too great.
Scared it'll catch a cold?
I'm sorry?
Nothing. That was a joke.
/- joke?
How lovely!
It wasn't a great one.
Yes, Claire?
He's shedding?
No, that's not normal.
What dry food do you give him?
Obviously. You need to overhaul
his whole diet.
Go organic.
You do Henri good.
He's less grouchy.
- Really?
- Yes.
Good.
I'm some use for once.
Are we made to be of use?
Who can say?
When you find your place,
your thing,
you must feel better.
Maybe.
It's like how some people
can make you feel good or bad...
Do you know anyone like that?
Of course I do.
Certain clients stress me.
Does anyone make you feel good?
That's less frequent.
I can't think of anyone right now.
I find your presence very soothing,
for instance.
You do?
I didn't know
I could have that effect...
You can.
And another thing...
- You seem familiar.
- I do?
It's not just you,
that's an example.
Still the same example...
We don't have many people
in common.
Indeed.
So you find me familiar
and reassuring?
How do you find me?
I don't find you that reassuring.
But friendly.
Only friendly?
Yes. Why?
You'll catch cold in that shirt.
You could have dressed.
It's Sunday.
The day for your Sunday best.
You're so square.
It's the Lord's Day for Valérie.
Make an effort.
God isn't against dressing gowns.
Not in the Bible.
For pity's sake...
- I'm not good like this?
- You are.
You'd be sexier in a nice shirt.
Really?
You made the ravioli yourself?
No, they're from a can.
But I used Comte cheese
instead of Gruyere.
A fine exploit.
We're full of admiration.
The cohabitation is going well?
We had a clash at first
when I touched the piano.
But it's all ok now.
Let her play.
You had it tuned last year.
Stay out of it.
It's ok, I don't play anymore.
You loved hearing Mum play.
Enough of old memories.
So sell the piano. Be logical.
When'll you stop organizing my life?
When you stop meddling in mine!
One point each.
Keep your nose out!
Don't talk to her like that.
I speak how I want here!
Won't you play for us?
It's not a good idea.
It is.
Play us something, Constance.
At a push,
I prefer that to another Sunday row.
I remember a Bach adagio.
But it was long ago.
He doesn't like Bach?
Or classical music in general?
No, honey,
it made him think of Mum.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
We'll be going.
And the crumble?
- We haven't had my crumble.
- I'm not hungry, honey.
Sunday lunch without dessert
is a bit sad.
I like to end on a sweet note.
Take it with you.
Have some with tea.
No, we'll leave it.
I made it for you.
Eat it and give me
the dish next time.
- Washed if possible.
- Of course.
I loved your pasta, Constance dear.
May I call you that?
Yes...
Literature, Languages
and Social Sciences
Piponnier, Constance: Failed
Hello!
How are you today?
The sun's shining. It's lovely!
Maybe.
It's early.
I have my first-aid class,
so I stopped off to pick up
my crumble dish.
All right.
I haven't had time to wash it.
I was kidding.
It's clean.
You're a real joker.
I love humour.
Especially when it's funny.
It's better when it's funny.
Constance?
Sit down.
Henri!
Quick! Constance is feeling bad!
What's wrong?
I don't feel well.
I'm going to be sick.
She's throwing up...
She's throwing up...
Not in my crumble dish!
It looks a bit like your crumble.
Don't ever drink alcohol again.
Got that?
Nothing ever works.
My life sucks.
Don't say that, Constance dear.
I redid my first year.
Now the second?
I can't go back to Orléans.
That wouldn't be so bad.
It'd be a disaster.
I panic at every exam.
My life will be a failure.
I'm a piece of shit.
Maybe, Constance dear,
but it's too soon to say.
Right, Henri?
She's realistic.
That's a good thing.
It's a matter of guidance.
She hasn't found her place yet.
Think accountancy was my place?
You did well, didn't you?
I did well, yes, but it was torture.
You hated your job?
Like most people.
I don't want that.
So what do you want to do?
What do you like in life?
Loads of things.
But my dad says
all I can do is loaf about.
That's not a job.
And the piano?
Why did you give up?
They put me off it.
A teacher at the local academy.
Mr Leguélec, an asshole.
Before him, I loved to play.
I even won prizes.
Take it up again.
I'm too old now.
Not at all. It's never too late.
Just take the time.
There's an African proverb that says,
"Slowly curves the banana."
Shall I play Bach or Chopin?
No Bach, no Chopin...
And no Schubert either.
Your wife played all my favourites.
I forbid you to talk about
my wife, ok?
How about this?
Don't know it.
I wrote it myself.
There you go.
Play your own stuff
and it'll be fine.
It's pretty too.
Lovely.
I think that's the first compliment
you've ever paid me.
You just need to earn it.
Excuse me...
What happened to his wife?
She died.
30 years ago.
It's time he moved on.
He's been alone since?
All alone.
How did she die?
She fell from the window
while cleaning it.
From the third floor, that's fatal.
Think it's funny?
It's a dumb way to die.
She's dead all the same.
He blamed himself.
He'd always refused
to hire a cleaner.
Paul likes you a lot in any case.
Don't you?
Your husband's very nice.
How about you?
Got a boyfriend?
Not right now.
A pretty girl like you?
And more mature men,
do they ever attract you?
What do you mean by that?
I don't know.
I thought maybe
you liked Paul.
No, not at all.
Really, I swear.
Good then.
Goodbye, Constance dear.
Goodbye.
What is it?
Can I have a word?
What do you want?
It's about Valérie.
I think she loves your son.
She's touching.
She's scared of losing him.
Of course she is!
She's been living off him for years.
She gives him dumb ideas too.
Such as?
None of your business!
Your problems aren't mine!
If you let me down, you're out.
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
You have until Monday
to pack your bags and vanish.
The ad was just posted.
Yes, but I already let it.
It's crazy, everythings let.
I can't do anything for you.
It matched my budget.
What do I do?
I don't know. Keep looking.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mum!
Sweetheart!
I've missed you so much.
You too, Mum.
Come in.
Constance, wait a second!
You've taken my room?
We're just redecorating.
We'll put your things
back like before.
We'll use it as an office
when you're away...
I get it.
It's still your room, sweetheart.
What if I want to sleep here?
There's the living room couch.
Hi there!
- Did you win?
- No, we lost 7-0.
Well?
How's our Parisian?
Honouring us with a visit?
Don't worry, I won't stay long.
Stop it, I'm kidding.
Tell me...
your university exam results,
weren't they due last week?
Yes.
You failed again?
I knew it.
No, Dad.
I was waiting for everyone
to celebrate.
You passed?
Anne...
- What?
- She passed.
I don't believe it!
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.
I'm so happy.
Thanks.
Bravo. That's wonderful.
Got anything on ice to celebrate?
I'll fetch some champagne.
Good evening.
Are your bags packed?
I'll do what you asked.
Glad to hear it.
Paul's coming on Wednesday
after swimming.
I'll pretend to be late and...
you can turn on the charm.
Tell me a bit about him.
He's a big soccer fan.
He supports Bordeaux.
And he loves "Knulp".
A novel by Hesse
that I gave him when he was 20.
He's never got over it.
Well?
A letter from the bank.
And a few flyers.
Maybe there's something interesting
among them.
A plumber...
Pizza, sushi...
London School of Music...
What is it?
It's a school in London that teaches
musical writing, composition...
Why put flyers in Paris mailboxes?
That could be a good idea for you.
For me?
You can see me composing music?
Why not? That tune you played
was very pretty.
They'd never want me anyway.
- How do you know?
- I know.
No use dreaming.
Besides, I'd need a recommendation.
Know what's stopping you, Constance?
You believe you're not up to it.
My dad says everything I play
is nothing to write home about.
He's a jerk.
Are you crazy?
How dare you?
Surely I can say what I think?
Our opinions differ.
So that makes him a jerk?
Yes.
They differ hugely.
Paul? You're here?
Me?
I swim every Wednesday.
That explains your muscles.
You think so?
They're pretty discreet.
I didn't think they showed.
They do.
Really?
I'm getting out.
All right.
Wait!
Want a lift home?
It's ok, I'll take the metro.
I have to see my father.
In that case, why not?
Ok.
15 minutes left
with Lyons still being held back
by Benfica...
Lyons can't win a single game.
- You like soccer?
- I love it.
No...
I prefer Bordeaux to Lyons.
Seriously?
My dad's from Bordeaux.
He took me to games.
Ok.
Our only real moments together.
I went to be with him
but then I began to enjoy it.
And you?
PSG?
No, Bordeaux too.
You're kidding me!
Not at all.
You're from Bordeaux?
No, but I like the team.
I don't know why.
That's so funny!
Yes, it is funny.
Bordeaux has sold too many players.
They sell and never buy anyone!
It gets me so mad!
It's no way to make a winning team!
Absolutely!
It's true.
Dad?
He's not here?
He'll be back soon.
I'd like to show you something.
Really?
I must be dreaming.
I'm afraid it's not very feminine.
I don't agree.
"Knulp"!
I love it.
You know it?
Yes, very well.
Remember that touching bit
at the end...
When Knulp speaks to God,
it's sublime, isn't it?
Yes, it's beautiful.
And the "Demian" preface...
Do you remember this bit?
"Each man is the trace of a pathway.
We can understand each other."
"But explain no one
apart from ourselves."
You know it.
I love it.
You recite it well.
I do? Thank you.
When I said you seemed familiar...
I said that because
it's as if we've lived
the same things.
It's not easy with my father.
He doesn't try to understand me.
I get the impression it's like that
between you and Henri.
It's tough.
You sensed that?
- Am I wrong?
- Not at all.
Imagine, a father like him...
You should be firmer with him.
It's not easy.
He'll still love you.
He loves you a lot.
- It's not obvious.
- It is.
When he tells you not to catch cold,
I see that
as his way of saying, "I love you."
Perhaps.
You're so mature, Constance.
That's why I don't get on
with boys my age.
Men only become interesting
after they turn 40.
You're saying that to be nice.
No, you trouble me.
You don't like me?
No... Yes... very much.
It's impossible.
I'm way too old for you.
Screw how old you are,
convention,
what's done and what isn't.
You're mad!
What exactly are you thinking?
You're handsome.
Handsome?
No...
Endearing, funny, friendly...
But handsome?
- You're going?
- It's wiser.
- Not waiting for Henri?
- I'll call him.
Wait!
Here's my number.
I'd rather not take it. Sorry.
Too bad for me.
I had a nice evening.
So did I, Constance.
Tell my father that I stopped by,
that I waited and...
That he can go to hell?
Exactly. Do you mind?
You should tell him yourself.
You're not wrong.
I'll take it but I won't call you.
Tell me what happened.
My hearing aid died.
I didn't hear a word.
I disgust myself.
Spare me your qualms.
Sorry, but it's true.
How can I look at myself?
Don't bother trying.
He really loves his wife.
That airhead wants him to
sell the firm. And he listens!
That's all?
A firm doing well
that I built up over 50 years!
He'll probably call to fix a date.
I can't do it.
There's no need.
Keep teasing him.
If he gets too forward,
say, "Stop!
Not before we marry."
Valérie told him that.
So he waited.
Are you kidding?
Not at all.
Thank you!
I can tell you now...
I'm going to cycle around the world.
South America, New Zealand, Africa...
That's so cool!
I was going alone,
but it'd be better with someone else.
Would you be into that?
I really want to stay in Paris.
Even if we get a tandem
and I do the pedalling?
Come and dance!
I'll be going.
Already?
See you.
Thanks, that's so kind, Simon.
I have to be going.
Just slam the door.
And...
I'll call you.
You boat my yacht. Paul.
He hasn't called all week.
I don't dare call him.
Forget him, babe.
You know, DJs...
He's not just a DJ,
he's a real musician.
It was totally wild between us.
- I'll introduce you tonight.
- No thanks.
We're closed.
I'm here for Constance.
Hi.
You got my text?
Yes, I got it.
By the way, the expression
is "?oat my boat".
- Ok.
- I didn't reply...
I understand.
A married guy with a young woman
is tricky.
I told Valérie
I needed some time.
I promised nothing.
You don't need to.
I'm not a marriage-breaker.
I'll take all the blame,
just relax.
I'm not at all relaxed.
I'll buy you dinner.
Let's relax together.
I'm going outwith Mathieu
and his friends.
Are you ready?
Give me five more minutes.
Going to a disco?
A disco?
A club, yeah.
Yes, of course.
Where exactly?
Way across the city.
I can drive you there.
You prefer an hour-long metro ride?
My round.
You like champagne?
You bet! Are you sure?
Yeah!
Cool!
Thank you!
Isn't there some mistake here?
No, two magnums at 1,500,
that makes 3,000.
I'm sorry.
That was a really crap evening.
No. Why do you say that?
What's wrong?
I'm sick of it.
My life's a mess.
There are moments like that,
but they never last.
You're wonderful, Constance.
You don't know.
You don't know me.
True, I don't. But I see things.
I see you trying to break free
from your family, fighting,
doing your best.
It'll pay off one day.
You think so?
It's obvious.
You'll succeed, I can tell.
I'm touched to hear that.
It's not a good idea.
I really like you, Constance.
This is too rushed.
I understand.
I'll call you.
Let's meet again soon.
All right.
Life begins anew, just like that
One more time
And we begin
A brand-new story
And we begin
A brand-new story
It's a brand-new story
But that's a whole other story
Hello.
Hi there.
The car keys, please.
To go where?
- I just need the car.
- ok.
I nearly called a taxi.
- Do I get the keys?
- Here.
Let me explain.
The office party ran over.
I went with the others.
I didn't see the time.
I texted you.
I tried calling you 15 times!
The club was in a basement,
no coverage.
You were at a disco?
They're not "discos" anymore,
but clubs.
Out all night
and you correct my vocabulary?
No, not at all.
Honey...
Forgive me.
Who were you with?
Just colleagues.
I called Nicole at 2 am.
She said the party ended at 9:30
and everyone went home.
That's the official version.
Can you imagine Nicole in a club?
Whose is this? Nicole's maybe?
No, it's Jérôme's.
Rubbish!
You disgust me!
I've been thinking about
you all w-end
Thank you.
Hi, Constance,
your voice-mail again...
We said we'd see each other.
It's two days since we spoke.
I don't understand.
I called that London music school.
Just out of curiosity.
It's too late to get in this year,
but there's an entrance exam
next June.
That's ages away.
What'll I do all year?
Prepare for the exam.
I need a recommendation to apply.
Where's this from?
I did a quick trip to Orléans.
You got Leguélec to write this?
I said I was a retired tax inspector
with a few colleagues
who were still working.
It scared him for some reason.
Thank you.
I don't know what to say.
So say nothing.
A beer and a tomato juice.
Got it.
There's someone to see you.
Can I buy you a drink?
It's my treat today.
Flight, hotel...
We're having three days in Venice.
That's not possible, Paul.
Sorry. Forget what happened.
But why?
A connection this strong
only happens once in a lifetime.
- You're getting carried away.
- You bet!
Good job too.
If I didn't, I'd already be dead.
And Valérie?
She's at her sister's.
I'm free.
I'm not anymore.
I've met someone.
You have? But when?
Last weekend.
A guy my age.
I thought
you weren't into guys your age.
I'm sorry, Paul.
It's probably better this way.
Can I get you something?
No, thanks.
Jérôme would like to see you
at the courthouse.
He wants me to go there?
It's urgent, apparently.
What's going on?
I didn't want to tell you by phone.
Valérie called me
to ask about divorce proceedings.
It's me.
And?
You don't get it?
Valérie is pregnant.
The test-tube thing worked?
No, we made love normally.
It's incredible!
It came as such a shock...
I cried like a baby, she did too,
we hugged each other...
Just think.
We'd been trying almost ten years.
Planning to keep it?
I'm just asking...
You never know.
The situation isn't great.
You're awful, Dad.
And you?
Ten days ago, you wanted Constance.
Now you'll be a father?
Ten days ago,
I didn't know my wife was pregnant.
I'd lost my head.
You seemed happy anyhow.
I'm much happier now.
You're not pleased?
You're going to be a grandfather.
Of course I'm pleased.
Why do you say that?
If I'd said
you had terminal cancer,
you'd have looked the same.
So what should I do?
Jump for joy?
That would be a normal reaction, Dad.
A child, Paul...
It's a lot of worries.
Of course,
it's a wonderful concept.
But look at the world we live in.
Listen here, Dad.
We'll come to lunch on Sunday.
When Valérie tells you,
show a bit more enthusiasm
and be less of a stick-in-the-mud!
Are you threatening me?
- You threaten your father?
- Just warning you.
If things don't go well Sunday,
you'll never hear from us
or see us again.
You'll never see your grandchildren
and die alone like a dog.
You think that scares me?
- Fantastic!
- You think so?
I didn't know how you'd react
A baby, that's wonderful.
Valérie must be so happy.
She's radiant, yes.
It's much better this way.
I have to confess something,
Constance.
Paradoxically, I think this baby
came along thanks to you.
Wm at?
When we met at the pool,
and I left my father's in a hurry,
I arrived home
in a rather unusual state.
I felt very self-assured,
very important.
The doctor says she got pregnant
that evening.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
How can I thank you?
- Thank your wife.
- You're right.
We should avoid each other
for a few weeks.
If you want.
Mathieu, here's to a great trip.
We'll miss you.
Thank you. Cheers.
He won't cycle to Mauritius.
- For you.
- For me?
To protect your ears in the Andes.
- It suits me?
- It's great.
I never thought you'd go.
I wasn't staying in this crap bar
with ugly colleagues like you.
I'm sorry.
Constance...
Hi.
The university has written.
H' I understand right,
you never passed that exam.
I forbid you to drink!
Just leave me alone, ok.
Have you sent your application
to the music school in London?
I'm not applying-
Wm at?
I spoke to my dad about it.
It's not for me.
He's right.
I'll work on his stall.
Nothing but good news this week.
Why won't your dad
respect your choices?
Do you respect your son's?
I'm saving him from his own ruin!
That's what my dad says.
Do you know how my wife died?
Yes. She was cleaning the windows.
She didn't fall entirely by accident.
They found over 2.5 grams of alcohol
in her blood.
I don't drink a lot.
She said that too, at first.
Hello.
I wasn't sure you'd be here.
I won't be staying.
Good.
A chocolate cake.
I've gone off crumbles.
So no hello kisses?
No. Just minor security measures.
Our anti-terrorist plan.
He can't have forgotten lunch.
No, he wasn't going out for long.
He'll be here soon.
So, what's new, Constance?
I'm going back to Orléans.
To work on my parents' stall.
Really?
That's hard work.
Physically, yes.
But I like it.
I'm the manual type.
I have to face it.
Studies were never my thing.
I had something important
to announce but...
Henri had to be here.
Hello.
Hello, Henri.
I'm glad to see you.
I was waiting for you.
So, here I go...
I shouldn't tell you so soon,
but I can't wait.
All right.
Paul and I...
are expecting.
Congratulations, that's wonderful.
Thank you.
I'm glad you're pleased.
Yes, I'm very pleased.
To tell the truth,
I feared your reaction.
I wasn't going to act
the way Constance's dad does.
How does Constance's dad act?
Let's not talk about it now.
To the baby.
To the baby.
To the baby.
A baby's a wonderful thing.
If you don't mind,
I'll go and lie down.
Yes, it's a lot of emotion.
Yes, a lot of emotion.
He doesn't seem totally happy.
That's as happy as he gets.
Yes?
Have they left?
Yes, they didn't want to disturb you.
I'll be going too.
I just wanted...
to thank you for everything.
And...
to say that you were great
with Paul and Valérie.
You see, anything can happen.
That goes for you too.
Too late for me.
My dad's waiting.
Too late?
You're joking?
Don't wait to reach my age
to do what you want.
You only live once, Constance.
Goodbye.
Where are your bags?
I'm not coming back to Orléans.
I won't work on the stall.
You're joking.
I came all this way to hear that?
- I'm sorry.
- Forget sorry!
Fetch your things and get in the van.
I'm warning you.
Don't bother coming home.
Ever.
Your dumb emotional blackmail
won't work with me anymore.
I'll do what I want.
I want to play music.
Even if I fail, I'll try.
You can understand, right?
You really are pig-headed.
Like father, like daughter.
Everything ok?
If they take me,
you have to come to London.
You bet I'll come.
You won't get rid of me that easily.
I already have butter?ies.
Don't worry, you've worked non-stop
for months now.
It'll pay off.
I'm staking my life on it.
I know you'll succeed, Constance.
I love to hear that.
No cuddles!
Go on, you'll miss your bus.
See you in two weeks.
Yes, in two weeks.
Don't worry, I'll stay right here.
- If Valérie has her baby...
- I'll call you.
Wrap up warm.
Don't catch cold.
Did you often tell your wife that?
All the time, I think.
You must have really loved her.
Why do you say that?
No reason.
Goodbye, Henri.
Goodbye, Constance.
You can stay as long as you want.
That's really kind.
When Henri heard they'd taken you,
he was so happy.
After that and seeing his grandson,
he said he could go in peace.
Did he suffer?
No, I don't think so.
The ambulance crew revived him.
Antoine was born that night in
the same hospital, two floors down.
Every morning,
we took his grandson to him.
He was happy.
The look in his eyes...
He was proud.
He ordered champagne
to drink to Antoine.
The doctor refused.
He told him to go to hell.
When he heard you'd passed,
he asked for champagne again.
He drove the nurse mad.
One evening, he fell asleep as usual
and never woke.
What'll you do with this place?
A students' apartment, maybe.
Not while you're still here.
This is your home.
That's what Dad wanted.
I might stay a little.
I won't move to London right away.
I failed the entrance exam.
Shit...
I screwed up on the last round.
I was nearly there.
I preferred to lie to Henri
when I heard he wasn't well.
I understand.
What'll you do now?
Try to get in again next year.
- I won't give up.
- Great!
Henri wrote you this letter
in the hospital.
In case he didn't make it,
as he said.
Valérie and I will come on Saturday.
You'll meet Antoine.
I can't wait!
See you then.
See you.
My dear Constance,
I'm writing these lines in case
we never see each other again.
The doctor tells me that's
an extremely likely possibility.
These doctors are useless!
Anyhow, this won't take long.
Just a few words of advice
for your future life.
Don't walk around naked
in front of others.
Don't drink too much
and ignore your father.
I'll leave you my slippers.
You always pinched them anyway.
And the piano too.
I'd like you to have it.
Paul knows about that.
I'm proud you sat that entrance exam.
And that I'm a grandfather too.
When you get back,
you'll meet Antoine and you'll see
what a wonderful baby he is.
But with the mother he has,
check to see he has all his neurons.
You know, Constance,
contrary to what I always thought,
life is not something
you succeed or fail at.
No...
What matters lies elsewhere.
And one last thing...
Don't catch cold.
