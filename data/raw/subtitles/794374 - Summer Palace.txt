- Mrs. Qing.
- You've come for the mail?
Is this today's?
Beijing University Enrolment
- I'm going now.
- See you later.
I've got some bottles.
I'll put the money here.
Anyone there?
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What can I get you?
- A couple of things.
These are good.
I don't want one.
- They're imported.
- No.
Just a drag.
Your dad's not home.
What do you think?
Good music?
You're laughing?
Keep it up,
and I'll confiscate your letter.
I got a letter?
Give it here!
It's in my bag.
Get it yourself.
What's wrong?
What does it say?
Come on.
I got into the university.
Evening, neighbor!
Congratulations to your daughter!
Hello, Dad.
Go ahead and eat.
I'm going to school.
What for?
You got into college.
I'm meeting some friends.
Here.
Yu Hong, when you're in Beijing,
I won't be able to look after you.
Don't worry about me.
I've kept you waiting.
- What kept you?
- The traffic was awful.
- Whose bike is this?
- What's the problem?
Move your bike!
What's your problem?
Break it up!
Stop it!
How dare you hit a girl!
It's annoying.
All these motorbikes.
Quiet! We're trying to sleep!
Where were you?
I looked for you all day.
What for?
I wanted to go to the library
with you.
The book you wanted. Volume 1.
The second one's still there.
If you don't go soon,
someone else will take it out.
- Let's go.
- Tomorrow.
Then tomorrow,
you'll go shopping with me, too.
Hello.
Disgusting!
So we're going shopping tomorrow?
Have one.
They're really sweet.
I'm going. Bye.
Good night.
Can't sleep?
You're Yu Hong, right?
And you?
Li Ti.
My room's over there.
I'm learning English.
You know
they're all talking about you?
Who?
The others. Everyone.
Why?
They say your heart's been broken,
or you're lonely,
or you're a lesbian.
Really?
Why are you smoking out here
by yourself?
It's too crowded inside.
Let's go to my room.
My roommate's not there.
Sit down.
Wherever you want.
My roommate's from Beijing.
She rarely sleeps here.
I've pretty much
got the place to myself.
Make yourself comfortable.
Have you got a boyfriend?
No.
- And you?
- He's in Berlin.
On a scholarship.
What do your parents do?
My mother's dead.
And your dad?
He runs a little grocery store
in Tumen.
Come on.
Ruo Gu's back in a few days.
Want to meet him?
Sure.
Not worried I'll steal him?
No. You've got no chance.
You're really solid, you two.
Really, it's great.
She says we're like an old couple.
Ruo Gu!
My boyfriend, Ruo Gu.
Yu Hong.
Zhou Wei.
He's a student here, too.
"Crossing the barren steppe,
the night rises within you."
We see each other, right?
A mirror held up to the face of God.
Protecting workers is what counts?
And protecting peasants.
And intellectuals like you.
- How did we become part of this?
- We have to protect ourselves.
Can I bum a cigarette?
Want to dance?
- Don't just smoke.
- Come.
Work it, girl.
Get your classmate to dance.
Had I not viewed my life
in the light of the ideal,
its mediocrity
would have been unbearable.
That's how I saw things
when we met.
You came into my life.
You are my most refined friend.
It's very simple.
I knew from the moment I saw you
that we were standing
on the same side of the world.
And then we talked
the whole night long.
For all that, there are troubling
aspects to our relationship,
which can't be reduced
simply to pleasure or the lack of it.
I want to live
more and more intensely.
It's clear to me, nowhere more so
than in our relationship,
because there are times when
I'm clearly imposing my will on you.
If one takes desire lightly,
action will be constricted.
It was through love
that I understood this.
There's no getting away from it.
There are only illusions.
Illusions.
Those lethal things.
You look great.
The stairs.
Should be over here.
Let's give it a try.
This way.
- Doesn't seem right.
- What's the unit number?
238. That way.
Zhou Wei!
Zhou Wei!
The East Germans
say the Chinese should understand
the Berlin Wall,
because they built the Great Wall.
My roommate's gone on vacation
with her boyfriend.
To the Great Wall?
My room will be free.
Zhou Wei, you can use it
if you need to do some writing.
I'm giving the key to Yu Hong.
He is the man
I always dreamed of meeting.
It's as if I've always
been waiting for him.
Waiting for our encounter.
Today, my dream
has become reality.
But his presence frightens me.
I'm afraid of the danger
he brings with him.
But, at least for now,
I'm not so afraid that I can't act.
Because deep inside,
I know he deserves my trust.
Zhou Wei...
I want us to break up.
Why?
Because I can't leave you.
This plant is associated with love.
It's widely know as...
The reed.
Is anyone familiar
with the poem "Reeds"?
Can you recite it?
The reeds are deepest green
The white mist turns to frost
The one I'm calling to
Is somewhere by the water
How is it?
Looks nice.
Come in.
You should get circumcised.
Why?
It would hurt less.
Who told you that?
My psychology tutor.
Why would he tell you that?
Because...
Because I slept with him.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
"Sunday afternoon has passed.
But I can't shake the feeling
that remains after your visit.
In my mind, I go over
everything you spoke of.
The good news delights me,
but at the same time..."
- Where is Yu Hong?
- Inside.
It's boring.
"...I feel calm on the whole,
just a little odd and distracted.
I didn't expect us to share
so much in an hour,
nor to receive
so much good news..."
He's your boyfriend?
I've got some.
Have one of mine.
I love watching girls smoke.
You look so good when you smoke.
So he's your boyfriend?
Good looking.
I hear all the girls
want to sleep with him.
Have you slept with him?
What do you think?
You want to try with me?
- You're crazy.
- I'm not crazy at all.
What's the matter?
Stop fighting!
I'm stopping.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Sleep with him,
but don't do it in front of me.
What's wrong with you?
With me?
Ask yourself what's wrong with you.
I cannot find my home
Among the city's tower blocks
I wander to the ends of the earth
Through the swarming streets
Carrying my heavy shell
Sing!
Climbing bravely upwards
Zhou Wei, I'm sleeping here tonight.
No.
Chen Jun, let's grab a bite?
Supper.
What brings you here?
Come in.
- Can I take your bed?
- No problem.
I'm sleeping here!
- Let's go out for a bit.
- All right.
What's wrong?
I said he was sleeping here.
I just want a word with him.
We'll be back soon.
No hurry.
My stuff's outside.
Bye, Yu Hong.
Take it easy.
What's up with you?
I said no.
You're not sleeping here.
I'm staying unless you hit me.
If you...
Hit me again, and I'll go.
Hit me, and I'm gone.
Go on.
Yesterday, I hung around Zhou Wei's
dorm like a fool all evening.
No one spoke to me.
We sang songs.
"The Snail's Home."
I wanted to leave...
...but I wavered, and I stayed.
Later, Zhou Wei slapped me.
I cried.
He took me in his arms
and held me for a long, long time.
That's not the worst part.
What's worse is to know this sort
of thing will happen to me again.
I curse my stupidity, my futility.
These hallucinations
always torment me.
When I'm impatient,
when I can't bear
to wait to see him.
But I've gone too far ahead.
I thought you were
far away from me,
while you were right there,
gently holding my hand.
Let's break up.
Seriously.
I've thought about it.
Let's break up.
If I were a man, I'd never let you go.
You mean in bed?
I mean everything about you.
So far, no one has managed it.
Zhou Wei could.
Really?
He's not talking to me.
You scared him.
Guys like him...
They like gentle girls.
You're so hard
you make him impotent.
Really?
When I saw you on the roof,
I was really scared.
I thought you might jump.
Jumping would have been easy.
But I wouldn't.
Looking at my face in the mirror,
I don't see the face of a young girl.
Instead, I see the face
of a mature woman.
Complex desires.
Emotions ripened prematurely.
Nonchalance and coldness.
All written on my face.
When I see my face,
I think of another face beside it.
How I long to see
both faces together.
I talked to Zhou Wei about you.
- What did he say?
- He said you're crazy.
What did you say?
I said, "Don't be stupid.
She's perfectly sane."
Clothes everywhere!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Is it something I said?
What's wrong?
Stop it.
What did you put on the wall?
I'm going to bloody tear it down!
Enough!
Don't get upset.
I need to write down some things
that have been happening in my life.
And I want to tell Zhou Wei.
First:
Our decision to break up
didn't work out as planned.
Maybe I'm doomed
to be bound to him.
Together or apart.
Second:
Song Ping, as serious as she seems,
is a book thief.
She's stolen loads of books
and taken them home one by one.
Third: I taught Dongdong
how to masturbate.
One day, I took her to Li Ti's room.
I told her to stand in front
of the mirror and to feel her body.
Those days, Dongdong and I
were always together.
Later, we met two boys
from another university.
One evening,
they came to see us.
And they ended up staying.
One slept with Dongdong,
the other with me.
How much?
You want an ace?
The fourth thing:
Today, I spent the whole day
at the swimming pool.
And a frightening thing
happened again.
I couldn't sit still or remain calm.
I wanted to keep writing,
but I couldn't.
I did what I normally do.
I shut my eyes tight.
I was in a cold sweat.
I wanted to lie down.
Just to lie down.
It would have done me good.
Then I climbed into the pool,
and I sat at the boundary between
the deep and the shallow end.
My breathing grew weaker.
I wasn't sure I'd recover.
I lost consciousness.
Fifth thing:
The students of Beijing University
went to Tiananmen Square.
Help me up!
Every ray of light
Will be absorbed by me
All the air will be inhaled by me
Every single thing
Will be weightless
Our love has been
To the end of all roads
As I was getting ready
to go far away,
I asked her if she wanted
to leave her country.
I heard her whisper good-bye,
and that I should forget her.
Seeing her so resolved,
I murmured, "Good-bye."
Tears streamed down my face,
but not because we were parting.
Quiet.
What are you doing in here?
What department are you in?
Get dressed!
Come with us.
Did you hear me?
Hello.
I came here to tell you...
...that Zhou Wei and Li Ti
are sleeping together.
The college administration
caught them in the act.
It will be made public soon.
You shouldn't see him anymore.
Hey!
Fuck off!
What are you doing in Beijing?
I was worried about you.
I'm going home!
Calm down!
Please calm down.
Sit down.
Sit.
Girls over here, thank you!
Unity is strength!
Unity is strength!
