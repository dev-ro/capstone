For 7 years,
the Greek people have lived
under the weight
of a colossal debt.
A new government will bring hope
for a way out of the prison of debt.
If we win this election,
after all these years
of deprivation and oppression,
everything will change.
They beat the drum and we danced.
Now, we'll beat the drum
and they'll dance.
If we win,
we'll never pay the debt.
We'll force them to pay damages.
European banks
gambled mountains of money and lost.
They reached an astronomical debt
of one trillion.
The governments
of France and Germany
transferred 600 billion
of the banks' losses
onto the European taxpayers.
And in order to save the German and
French banks and some Greek banks,
they transferred another 320 billion
of the banks' losses
onto the Greek taxpayers.
To be paid by Greek people:
320 billion.
We are going to destroy the oligarchy
which built a system,
a network of power,
which sucks the economic power
in our society.
If they win,
we kick them out of the Euro.

Speech!
I'll make my speech
after the final results!
Europe will see us
for what we really are.
A statement!
Later!
The statement...
The statement will come
only after the final results.
Later!
So? What now?
We make a government.
We find allies
and change the country.
What allies?
After the swearing in ceremony
at the Parliament,
instead of swearing on the Gospel,
the new PM declared
he would respect the constitution.
- Communists!
- Is that what we got wrong, Steve?
No, you won the elections.
You are the Minister of Finance
and you achieved a majority
with a far-right alliance.
When you were in Washington,
I used to refer to you as the Prince
of Darkness with my students.
Prince?
I've been called a lot worse.
I am going to need your advice.
You're left-wing radicals.
They'll do all they can to crush you
and the hope you represent.
The Germans and their allies
will strangle you.
It'll be a tragedy for your people.
It's already a tragedy.
What's your plan?
Compromise and everything.
Without ending up compromised.
Your party promised the voters
you'd wipe out the debt.
There are electoral promises
and there's reality.
Meaning?
I want to negotiate the restructuring
of the debt, forgiving part of it
and putting an end to austerity
so the economy can grow again.
They won't let you do that.
The Prime Minister fully supports me.
And the radicals in the party?
They obey the Prime Minister.
You're an outsider.
In politics and in power.
An outsider who values his freedom.
Well, I've decided
to become an insider.
But I'm keeping my freedom.
I've already prepared my resignation.
You've just won
and you're preparing your defeat?
This letter will allow me to do
what I have to do,
which is to get the country
out of the prison of debt.
You're staying an outsider.
The insiders will never forgive you.
5 months and 12 days later
I resigned.
I've been arguing
with the Prime Minister for four hours.
Six months of arguing
and he still doesn't get it.
He just doesn't understand.
Berlin wants to punish this country
and to make him submit.
It's a no-win situation.
Just Berlin or... all of Europe?
Everyone.
He thinks Angela is his friend,
that she'll support him.
In fact, she won't cede a thing.
She won't retreat an inch.
You did all you could to help.
He did nothing
when his people attacked you.
You were right.
You should have resigned then.
He backed me...
for a long time.
We'd agreed on everything.
He had accepted my propositions.
For the Germans,
the French, the Italians...
They're not expecting us
to negotiate everything.
In an open, constructive spirit.
But firmly!
The Germans want to kick us
out of the Euro.
They can dream on!
We're in the Euro and we're staying.
He's not a Party member!
And don't become one.
They'll eat you alive.
Don't like my choice of ministers?
Shut up or leave!
They must understand our determination.
The party's program
is not necessarily the government's.
No sado-monetarist?
Not here yet.
Why is the Troika leader coming
two days after elections?
Three days. And he is not the leader.
Will he announce a Grexit?
Or the Cyprus play?
If so, we're doomed.
There will be blood at the banks.
They've never given a shit about us!
- They're here.
- They? How many?
This isn't Cyprus.
We can't reject their demands forever.
Yes, we can.
And their bullshit too.
Please come in.
These are my colleagues.
This is the president of Eurogroup.
Representative of IMF in Greece.
Nice to meet you.
- Minister of the Territory.
- Very nice to meet you.
We'll be back in a moment.
Please.
So...
I'm keen for us
to build a good, working relationship,
President.
But I must tell you that...
Troika's methods have been
counterproductive.
Troika's not much appreciated here.
No, not really, no.
Tell me,
what are your intentions
regarding the MoU you despise?
The Memorandum of Understanding to
reform your country and repay its debt.
Please have a seat.
We need to find a compromise between
our program that our people voted for
and your MoU
that has wrecked our economy.
That won't work.
Are you saying
that compromise is not an option?
You have fifteen days before committing
to the MoU at the Eurogroup meeting.
If not, the program crashes.
That's an ultimatum!
Three days after our election.
Our country's in ruins and you're
throwing us out of the Euro!
- I didn't say that.
- You implied that!
You're not interested in a compromise,
are you?
Your MoU is indecent
and impossible to achieve!
Then I'll announce to the media
that you reject the MoU,
in other words, quitting the euro,
your economy collapsing, chaos...
Okay! Let's go tell them.
Wait, wait, wait! What?
What do we tell them?
You tell them what you like.
I'm gonna welcome you.
Good morning.
I would like to thank all of you
for attending this first meeting
with the president of Eurogroup,
whom I'd like to welcome to Greece.
I will now hand over to him.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Today I've had
very constructive meetings
with members of the government.
I appreciate the welcome
we've received.
Same speech for five years.
It's a first step towards
our forthcoming collaboration.
Excuse me.
Minister, will you cooperate
as slavishly with the Troika
as your predecessors did?
Cooperate with
the European Commission,
the European Central Bank
and the IMF... Yes!
But...
not with their bureaucrats
who have applied
the same degrading methods
for five years.
They're the Troika.
Even the European Parliament
considers their proposals flimsy.
Any cooperation with them
is off the table.
You just killed the Troika.
They're our strength.
They can turn against us tomorrow.
Only if we disappoint or betray them.
One day, we'll disappoint them.
Not necessarily.
They'll ask for more and more.
We'll disappoint them.
FOR RENT
FOR SALE
FOR RENT
FOR SALE
FOR RENT
See?
Everything's closed.
You must help them re-open.
Here's your Ministry.
You paid me.
By kicking the Troika in the balls.
Listen to them, but no promises.
They're dynamite.
My suitcase!
I know the problem.
Prepare a decree to rehire them.
I'll sign it when I get back.
In four days.
We'll be here.
Rehiring 300 cleaning women
will not please Europe and the Troika.
They better get used to it.
The taxi drove off.
With my minister outfit?
Great!
Go find him. Hurry!
Good morning.
This sums up our tragedy:
we're in debt to German banks
for buying German limousines.
Take note:
all limousines will be replaced
by cars for the leftists
we claim to be.
That's more media spectacle
than economics.
It's a media society.
The Troika will appreciate our savings.
Paris - Finance Ministry
Is it warm?
Yes, it is.
A bit large.
The French don't care how people dress.
But the English...
Elevator
straight to the Minister's office.
Yanis!
Bonjour!
Welcome!
- Ambassador.
- Minister.
- Minister.
- Pleased to meet you.
Welcome to Paris.
- My team.
- Good morning, welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Yanis! I'm so happy to see you!
Thank you for this warm welcome,
Minister.
Call me Michel.
Dear Michel...
Your warm welcome,
our long-standing friendship
with France, her solidarity,
are absolutely necessary for us
to exit the MoU and to make
a new contract with the European Union.
I presented our project at length,
for a restructuring of the debt,
for a realistic budgetary policy
against austerity
and for reforms to combat corruption
and the privileges of the oligarchy.
I explained in detail our proposals
for getting out of the crisis...
Michel thought they were perfect.
The success of your program
will be ours too.
We must replace
Europe's neoliberal austerity frenzy
with a viable program that you need,
as does the rest of Europe.
The press awaits us.
We waited too long to rebuild Europe.
We need growth.
Berlin is upset
you came to Paris first.
Well, you invited me and I came.
George Osborne, your colleague,
invited me to London, I go to London.
You must go to Berlin
as soon as possible.
Is that an invitation or a summons?
Good morning.
Thank you all for coming.
The picture.
Thank you.
Let me welcome
a friend and representative
of a sacrificed country
that has been suffering for years.
But Greece made promises
to its creditors
and the government must honor them.
Greece must respect previous
agreements with discipline.
But they must sign the MoU,
the Memorandum of Understanding.
I decided to respond
without controversy,
to emphasize the cultural, amicable
relations between our two countries.
France, a friend for two centuries.
I had come to set out for the Minister
the broad outlines of the reforms
which we needed to implement...
I continued in the same friendly tone
despite the humiliation
Michel had inflicted on us
to please Berlin.
That will be all, thank you.
The group photo.
Thank you, gentlemen.
What are you doing?
Say one thing in private
and the opposite in public?
Get used to it.
Yanis.
You must understand,
France is no more what she used to be.
Come meet our Minister of the Economy,
Industry and Digital Economy.
And more surprises up his sleeve.
- Yanis!
- Emmanuel!
- How are you?
- I'm okay. How are you?
Fine. Has Michel been telling you
about France?
Oh yes, apparently no longer
what she used to be.
They're all obsessed
with the difficulties.
We need to imagine another France,
a France that succeeds.
Yes.
Come this way.
Come with me to my office.
Are you going to Berlin?
No, I'm going to London.
George Osborne invited me there.
And I'm gonna use his invitation
to placate the money men in the City.
It all happens in Berlin.
But Berlin hasn't invited me.
I guess they're waiting for me
to invite myself.
Your situation
depends entirely on Berlin.
You should go to Berlin.
London
Both the average Englishman
and the ruling class
consider Europe
an obstacle to progress.
For them,
France clings to Europe
to avert its own decline.
Their opinion of us?
Lousy. Laced with contempt.
But Minister Osborne respects you, sir.
Finance Minister
I'm sure the French
declared their undying love for you
without promising anything.
As for us,
no, we don't really love you,
especially your polydogmatic Party
and your economic policies
which, frankly,
they are a major danger
to the global markets.
And nor are we willing to intervene
in the Eurozone's affairs.
I never expected George Osborne,
a Eurosceptic, to be so open.
He had explained to the press
that he was welcoming me
because he thought that our crisis
was a significant risk
for the global economy.
What do you want me to do for you?
He promised to help us,
but did nothing significant.
Except to encourage me
for my meeting with the financiers,
and to prepare me
for the savage attacks ahead.
I have to warn you.
There are a couple of killers
towards the back.
Don't worry.
Yanis will take care of them.
Sure. Good luck.
Thank you all, for...
Thanks.
I want to thank you all
for attending this meeting.
If you've come here
to defend your economic program,
you might as well leave
straight away.
You're facing a massive sell-off
of Greek bonds and shares.
Are you in favor of privatization?
Well, it depends on the terms
and on the price of course.
Would you sell the Parthenon?
For a good price?
The Parthenon is not mine to sell.
It belongs to all of humanity.
We were elected
to preside over a bankruptcy
that neither our predecessors
nor Europe were ready to admit to.
Europe set up a rescue plan
to save Greece.
The rescue plan was to save
the German and French banks.
Shame!
Nonsense!
Their colossal debt was transferred
onto the Greek people.
How are you planning on satisfying
the expectations
of your populist promises?
My Prime Minister
is fully aware of the realities
and we're ready,
we're prepared to compromise.
But on one condition:
our nation's debt slavery ends.
I've come here to propose a link
between
our debt level and our national income.
It's exactly the same methods that you
use here in the City, or in Wallstreet.
So why not use them to save Greece?
This is the total debt:
473 billion.
Of this mountain of debt,
only 15% is owed to you.
I'm proposing a restructuring
of the 85% that is owed to the Troika
and not touch your 15%.
You've already suffered
a major write-off.
And to tell you the truth I prefer
not to turn you guys into my enemies.
And what are you going to do
with the 85%?
I'm going to propose to the Troika
and the European institutions
to become our partners in growth
for 15 years to come.
You really think that's enough
to convince them?
Almost certainly not!
That's why we are also proposing
the end of austerity.
Even your own pro-austerity
Finance Minister Osborne
thinks that the demands
on Greece are exorbitant.
So instead,
we're pushing for the profound
transformation of the State
and for tax rates
to encourage foreign investment,
including I hope, yours.
Big success.
You'll see the results tomorrow.
Good morning, sir.
Mr. Minister, the Adam Smith Institute
loved your speech.
Great! Leftist economists won
over Thatcher's favorite think-tank.
Our comrades will make us pay.
Yes?
What's that ridiculous coat?
My daughter already yelled at me.
Thank you.
I recorded this.
Greek stocks are going crazy.
They're up 11.2%,
in the hope of a resolution
of the debt standoff
between the radical government
and its creditors.
Now the Germans will respect you.
Frankfurt
European Central Bank
Your debt amounts to 186 billion
owed to the EU.
29 billion to the ECB,
plus 25 billion to the IMF.
And don't let me get started
on the money Greece's banks owe us.
Altogether, more than 410 billion.
Your GDP has dropped
from 250 billion to 175 billion.
Plus 100,000, plus 250,000,
plus 480,000,
plus 600,000.
The ECB can no longer underwrite
confidence in your banking system.
Welcome, Your Excellency.
I'm in charge of your security.
Please, follow me.
- Mr. Minister...
- Mr. Ambassador...
We don't need bodyguards.
Orders of the German government,
Minister.
The ECB's loss of confidence
in our banks
made the Athens Stock Exchange
fall 10%.
You lost what you gained in London.
German Finance Ministry
- Good morning, Minister.
- Good morning.
When do I get my money back?
So, here you are at last.
- I'm listening.
- Your Excellency...
Call me Wolfgang,
I'll call you Yanis if you don't mind.
So, Wolfgang...
I'm here to work together
to end this long-standing drama,
detrimental to both our countries.
My Prime Minister has authorized me
to assure you
that we are committed to the Euro,
we are proposing
the beginning of negotiations
which could lead
to a compromised solution
acceptable to both our creditors
and our people.
We're not asking
for an outright debt reduction,
but for a reasonable link
between our repayments
and the increases
of our national income.
In addition, we're working
on an algorithm hunt for tax evaders.
Now, when I outlined this proposal
to London's bankers...
Cheap fireworks.
I'm not inclined to discuss
anything you're proposing here.
Regarding tax evasion, we are prepared
to send you 500 specialists
to sort things out.
You already sent the Troika
over four years ago.
They control the economy,
imposing policies on ministers
and turning this crisis into a tragedy.
I didn't send them, Europe did it.
You cannot expect us to fund your very
generous social security system,
a Communist dream.
Well, our priority is the survival
of this social security system.
Major savings can be made elsewhere.
These are our proposals,
our modest proposals.
For the institutions.
Your Excellency,
it is regrettable that the proposals
of our newly elected Greek government
be sent to the institutions,
the technocrats of the Troika,
without being discussed
by the political representatives.
The journalists are waiting, gentlemen.
You have 12 days
before the Eurogroup meeting
to reconsider your strategy.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.
I have met with my Greek colleague.
And despite
our very cordial discussions,
we can only agree on the fact
that we agree about nothing.
We don't even agree on that.
Either Greece toes the line
or steps out of the line.
Now I'll leave you with the Minister.
If we have understood correctly,
it's stalemate?
Well, the Minister
has a radical position.
We have a radical position.
So everybody has to make an effort
to understand the other.
Minister, do you think
he'll end up dancing to your beat?
There are electoral speeches
and there are social realities.
My country is going
through a humanitarian crisis
and Europe is facing
an existential crisis,
so we all must collaborate,
but in order to do that,
we have to be non-dogmatic.
What about
Greece's anti-German fanaticism?
Do you plan to negotiate
or eradicate it?
What about German fanaticism
against Greece?
We need to stop these stupid games
that only breed hatred
and racism.
Our government wants dialogue,
negotiation.
But they don't want to discuss
or negotiate with you.
We are a people of millennial patience.
And we have stoicism in our blood.
Nevertheless, this crisis
is dangerous for all of us.
The German people know
better than anyone what can result
from economic crisis
combined with national humiliation
and endless despair.
This is how the serpent's egg hatches.
Back in Athens
I will be in a parliament where
the third largest party
is not neo-Nazi,
but just Nazi.
And it has thrived on this crisis.
That's why we need your help, sir.
We need the help of the German people
to fight against the fear of the other
and return to a normal life
in the European Union.
And that depends on you, Minister.
Hang in there, Minister.
The Germans or just Wolfgang?
Both.
Wolfgang is organizing
our exit from the Euro.
They're waiting.
Step 1:
have the European Bank
cut off cashflow to Greece
so our banks close.
What do we do?
Prepare for the Eurogroup meeting.
It will all play out there.
And prepare to replace the Euro,
in case they kick us out.
Any progress?
As you requested, I'll form a team
to work on a Plan B.
That mustn't get out.
It won't.
Talk only about Berlin.
Of course.
Welcome!
Fuck Brussels.
The Russians will give us billions.
They're broke.
And they are not a solution.
Tell us about your European tour.
The stock exchange traveled too.
It went up, up, up.
Then down, down, down.
Who cares about stocks?
To sum it up:
they all want us to apply the MoU.
The what?
The Memorandum of Understanding,
signed by the right.
I didn't know it was called M-O-U!
We won't submit to it.
We ran against it.
Wolfgang swears only by the MoU.
Doesn't he know we won the election?
Our people are fed up
with Berlin's diktats.
Many agree with Wolfgang.
The French? The English?
The French... are weak.
Hollande helps a little...
We can't expect much from the English.
The European Bank?
The European Bank
will cut off our cashflow
if we refuse the MoU.
Your trip was a disaster.
The papers say
you called Wolfgang a Nazi.
Lies! Sit down.
They're attacking all of us.
Anyway...
- Your proposal?
- Fuck Brussels. And fuck the debt.
- What next?
- Next, they'll negotiate.
The first Eurogroup meeting
is in 12 days.
We have two options.
Number 1: we sign the MoU
and we're good guys.
Number 2:
we stay intransigent
and get kicked out of the Euro.
In short,
to reach an agreement
with the Eurogroup,
it's imperative that we present
a united front.
Their threats mustn't affect us.
We go there to negotiate.
We'll go all the way if we must.
- Strong-arming them can backfire.
- Acting weak is worse.
We can fight and not get fucked.
Listen.
If we go there ready to roll over,
it'll be a disaster.
Thank you, Fenia.
Now, this meeting along with others
that will follow must remain secret.
We need an initial evaluation
for the first Eurogroup meeting
in which I'll most likely be threatened
with expulsion from the Euro.
- The meeting is in 10 days.
- I know, there is not much time.
So, you need to study hard
every aspect,
prevent shortages,
and if need be, issue
first, digital,
and then paper currency.
Of course
this must be in utter secrecy.
If this gets out,
there'll be national panic.
We wanted to fire 2,000 doctors.
Then 2,000 more.
And another 2,000!
When they decided to go on strike,
we fired them all at once!
8,000 doctors fired.
How many hospitals had to merge?
Nobody knows.
The figures weren't released.
We need the doctors back.
Many went abroad.
- How many?
- Over 3,000.
The Prime Minister wants us
to consider rehiring them
and re-opening the hospitals.
To draw up a list
of progressive reforms
that can replace
the austerity cuts.
The vindictive austerity cuts.
Fire sales
that benefit only the oligarchy.
The Troika calls this "The Program".
The program enables the Troika
to sell-off Greek assets
without government control.
Now, this is the Greek official
that runs the program.
What do you sell?
Everything.
Anything belonging to the State.
Highways, land, beaches,
buildings, ports, railroads.
And airports of course.
And lots more of our country's wealth.
It's not a sell-off, it's a sale.
Actually, it is a sell-off.
But with no real effect.
Let me show you why.
So, this money reimburses the debt.
At the same time the Troika
is forcing us to take out new loans
to pay the debt,
which creates more debt.
This deficit requires higher taxes.
At the same time we cut
wages, pensions,
benefits and public investment,
lowering the incomes,
which in turn slows down
the economy even further
and it all creates
lower tax receipts for the State.
Which leads us to fresh new loans
to repay the old loans.
All these create
more unpayable debt.
It's a vicious doom loop
as you can see
in the subtitles.
Whatever we sell
doesn't make any difference
on the debt.
What I need from you is
detailed research and proposals
on each point.
Starting from privatization.
So, Kim here
will be following your work.
Thank you. And we'll speak later.
Okay, let us start with European
Central Bank first, shall we?
You work only with foreigners.
Eavesdropping?
Not at all.
Your Eléni worked for the right.
The Prime Minister knows.
Minister!
This is Sven, the European tax expert.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.
Yani, you go to the Eurogroup
and you blow it up.
No pasaran.
Hasta la victoria siempre!
This way, please.
- But they did pass.
- What?
Nothing.
Brussels European Commission
There it is!
Are you leftist or radical leftist?
The tie!
Come.
This way, please.
Welcome to our circle.
We look forward to hearing
what you have to say.
I'm sure
we are going to do good work.
Thank you.
Please take your seats.
We're about to begin.
I'd like to thank all of you
for your presence here
at this very important meeting.
The representatives
of the new Greek government,
the debtors, are with us.
The creditors,
the IMF,
the ECB.
The representatives
of the European Commission
and your colleagues,
the Finance Ministers of the Eurozone,
are all impatient
to learn your intentions.
Minister, please take the floor.
Try to be brief.
Thank you, Mr. President,
colleagues...
After five years,
I understand that you are tired
of the Greek drama.
Believe me,
the Greek people are tired of it too.
We are here to negotiate
and win your confidence
without losing that of our people.
It is our commitment
to clean up our finances
and make the fundamental reforms
our predecessors
did not succeed in making.
Now, I know
some of you may regret
the victory of the left.
But I assure you
we are committed Europeanists.
I'm here to find common ground
with you.
I'm asking not for
an erasure of our enormous debt
but for its restructuring.
And we also seek
the renegotiation of the MoU
in order to end the austerity
that is preventing
any deep reform of the country.
A bridge must be built
between the Troika and you
to renegotiate the MoU.
This people,
whose sacrifice is unbearable,
sends us message of democracy
with its new government.
Elections cannot be allowed
to change economic policies.
Your country has obligations
to implement the MoU in its entirety.
The people often change their minds.
The Eurogroup cannot start
over and over again every time.
That would be the end of the Eurozone.
What is the point of elections then?
If the popular vote is irrelevant
and we cannot discuss the MoU,
what are we doing here?
Perhaps we should ban elections
altogether.
What are you doing?
These are our proposals,
so that anyone can see
that they're solid.
We'll have a ten-minute break.
You can't distribute them.
I can't share the analysis of my proposals
on the MoU with my peers?
After all, the MoU
is the subject of this meeting!
No.
You can't hand them out before
first informing their parliaments.
If you do that now,
this meeting is over.
We should listen to them.
They're competent.
They've thought
about the different issues.
We're not here to listen to them,
Christine.
I already told the press
that we must hear the Greeks out.
Empty speeches...
Just bluster...
Mediterranean narcissism.
Ignorance combined with confidence,
to quote Mark Twain.
President,
the discussions have hardly began
and there's already
a communiqué.
Precisely, to discuss it.
It calls for flexibility with the MoU,
it's good.
It's a trap.
It says good relations,
meaning our budget
stays under Troika's control.
No mention of restructuring
or ending austerity.
This communiqué rules out any bridge
between the MoU program
and our people's mandate.
It's out of the question
to renegotiate the MoU.
In good faith, I'm asking
whether this communiqué could refer
to an "amended" MoU.
And you'd commit to an amended MoU?
President, we are prepared
to commit to an amended MoU
that is financially plausible
and socially just.
The word "amended" before MoU
would have to be accepted
by the German parliament.
I would not defend it.
It is out of the question
that our parliament
discusses amendments
on such short notice.
Do you understand?
It would take the Parliaments
2-3 weeks to approve any extension.
Today we cannot leave this room
without a joint press release.
That would oblige the central bank
to pull the plug.
Without cash,
your banks will close in a few hours.
President,
you are giving me an ultimatum
at my first Eurogroup meeting.
Because of parliamentary procedures
and delays,
all that I have said to save
my country from suffering means nothing
because the MoU is the MoU.
Because the MoU is what it is
and nothing can change the MoU.
As a democrat
I say no to your ultimatum.
You are like grasshoppers.
After spending
and squandering everything,
you demand
that the ants keep on supporting you.
Your country lied,
cheated and overspent.
We are not responsible
for previous governments.
You have extravagant salaries
and pensions.
The Troika has reduced them by 40%!
You want my people to pay
for follies that lasted decades?
Is the purpose of this meeting
to insult a people
and their representatives?
Take it or leave it!
Would you sign for adjusted
instead of amended?
You declared that the conditions
for the recovery of my country
are debt reduction
and a lower tax rate.
That's a lot more than an adjusted MoU.
Exactly. But the priority now is
to approve the press release
and continue negotiations.
I will advise my Prime Minister
to accept
"adjusted MoU to help us to resolve
the humanitarian crisis."
That's unacceptable.
The phrase humanitarian crisis
is too political.
Well, there's nothing more political,
President,
than ignoring a human tragedy
because it's too political.
Ten-minute break!
What do you think?
Accept adjusted alone.
- Yes.
- They'll close our banks.
Let's buy time.
Withdraw your humanitarian crisis,
it won't go through.
Adjusted is an important step
to avoid collapse.
Our Parliament will be opposed
if I concede everything
from the beginning.
Say that to Wolfgang,
he'll understand.
First, I have to speak
with my Prime Minister.
We need a longer break.
There's a quiet place over there
where you can discuss, alright?
Adjusted MoU is surrender.
Any alternatives?
They'll shut the banks.
Let's give in.
They won't crush us
at our first meeting.
You're taking too long.
This kind of communication
during a meeting is not normal.
What is normal?
You're forcing us to choose
between closing down our banks
and accepting new austerity measures
that turn the country into a wasteland.
Excuse me! But I have better things
to do than be on a never-ending break.
We're buying time.
Talk later.
See? We're buying time.
Yanis, all this is a huge waste.
You have one last chance to sign.
I'll sign whatever you want,
accompanied by the phrase
you consider too political.
It's a total stalemate
but you gained a little time.
Only a little.
I'm too old for these games.
Is it your plan to leave the Eurozone?
No.
But we won't bend over
under the threat of expulsion.
Your banks shut, no more money.
Well, as the Beatles say:
"Money can't buy me love."
The Eurogroup politics
provoked protests
in several European countries.
They accuse the Eurogroup
of conducting
anti-democratic
and neo-colonialist policies.
Your take on the meeting?
Under Wolfgang's thumb.
Now...
they'll try to overthrow you
or create chaos and blame it on us.
Most of them are against us.
"Empty speeches,"
"arrogance,
Mediterranean narcissism..."
I'm their target.
The French president smells danger.
I offered him an official visit.
You should talk to Merkel.
Only she can rein in Wolfgang.
Jeroen, president of Eurogroup.
Hello?
I'm waiting for you.
Jeroen is only a minister.
Alexis shouldn't meet him.
He's also president of Eurogroup.
Is Jeroen a puppet or the puppeteer?
- Thank you for seeing me.
- Please, come.
It's about the press release.
I've come to propose
instead of amended or adjusted,
the words updated MoU
or modified MoU.
Whatever you want.
But it has to be adjusted by
"to help to resolve
the humanitarian crisis".
In that case I'll come back
with another proposal.
Do it. Just do it.
Thank you.
We have to throw them a bone.
Let them choose
who they talk to and we lose.
This way.
They're furious.
This won't be fun.
The Troika are economic ideologists,
all the more fanatic because
as economists, they're mediocre.
They represent the high-ranking
officials of the Central Bank,
the IMF
and the European Commission.
And they're indifferent
to the suffering they cause.
Raising VAT taxes
on cigarettes and alcohol, gas,
car and truck sales,
rentals...
Second,
pushing the age of retirement
back to 67...
You forgot the home evictions
for the families
who could no longer
pay their mortgages.
Indeed, thank you.
Here are the figures.
I move to projects to be decided.
Cutting salaries by 30%.
And depending on categories...
You already cut them by 40%.
To activate
the reimbursement of the debt,
we have to cut another 40%.
So you're planning an overall cut
of approximately 65 to 70%.
This was the initial debt.
Five years ago,
this was our national income.
Thanks to the brilliant policy
that you guys imposed on us,
it is now 176 billion,
that is 26% less.
While the debt has grown by 6%.
Do you think we're here
to listen to your criticism, sir?
If you continue,
we'll halt this session.
Your previous government
committed you to sell 14 airports
belonging to the state.
Our government and parliament
will reconsider this.
Our mandate is to inform you,
that's all.
The proposal is
from a German state company.
They're offering 1.2 billion.
I think it's a fair price.
It is a pittance.
Any other bidders?
It is a very serious German company.
They will take out a loan
from your Greek banks,
a loan which you, Minister,
representing the Greek state,
will guarantee.
You want to buy our airports
with our own money?
Can you seriously see us
agreeing to this?
If not,
somebody else higher up will.
Excuse me.
Go see Pierre.
My editorial in Le Monde
had a big impact.
Juncker has a plan
to unblock the situation.
I'll keep you updated.
Good morning!
Read this.
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.
The big boss.
Where do I sign?
Are you serious?
Absolutely.
The meeting will go very well.
Did the President accept this?
It's been read and reread.
By Mario and Christine?
I just discussed it over lunch
with Juncker, Mario, Christine
and Jeroen.
And Wolfgang?
Not Wolfgang, but when he sees
that we all agree, he'll give in.
Will the President agree to this
without Wolfgang's consent?
Trust me.
Just one thing.
Intervene as little as possible.
I'm happy to say nothing.
You have to say
that you support this communiqué.
Let's go see the President.
Please come in.
Read and tell me what you think.
Even the word "adjusted"
has disappeared.
You promoted a communiqué which
my Prime Minister and I
were ready to accept.
Now, you are a commissioner
of the European Union.
Can you please tell me
which is the right version?
Would it be possible to combine some
lines of your version with this one?
No. Everything that could have been
taken from your version has been.
So you're telling me that
you're willing to accept this text,
which is the exact contradiction
of yours?
Whatever the President says.
Cross out what you don't like.
You are wasting our time!
You're sabotaging the meetings
with arrogant and unobtainable demands.
Empty bluster!
We are in Europe here!
Your position does not authorize you
to raise your voice!
Nor to ignore my proposals.
You are violating your duty
as President
which is to listen
to every member of the Eurogroup.
If you persist,
I will make your behavior public.
I apologize.
The tension is too high these days.
Yeah, it can happen to all of us.
The meeting was meant
to have started 15 minutes ago.
Any further delay
will breed toxic rumors.
The Eurogroup meeting did not achieve
any concrete agreement.
Others followed, long and repetitive...
with Byzantine discussions
that the President favored...
and press conferences
to convince the rest of the world
that the Eurogroup was working hard
to "save" Greece...
They just came up with a bunch
of fantastical proposals.
Led by an arrogant leftist,
an incompetent negotiator.
All my efforts to deny
or to correct that image
had been diverted against us
and against our propositions.
Another insulting article.
Nothing about what we're proposing.
Meeting will resume.
If you've come to taunt us,
we're in for a rough ride.
Meeting is over.
We'll see each other tomorrow,
same time, same place.
Wolfgang wants to send
the Troika to Paris.
The Troika never went to Paris.
They continued to attack us
and denigrate us in the media.
And the label of leftist
made all their lies credible.
Minister,
you refuse the MoU because
you're incapable of implementing it.
No.
This MoU that even
Spiegel Magazine describes as a...
"catalogue of cruelties"
contains promises
that are impossible to be kept.
It has produced a human tragedy
and an economic catastrophe.
I spoke to Angela,
who spoke to the President.
Go to the meeting. Stay calm and firm.
Find common ground.
Make or break.
Many people are rooting against you.
They just want to humiliate us.
Stay true to our three-page plan.
Five-page.
Minister, I asked you for a list
of reforms summed up in three pages.
You came up with five.
Mr. President,
my technical proposals aside,
I would like to remind this assembly
that 600,000 people
have not been paid for six months
and that hundreds of thousands of young
people are leaving the country.
We're here to listen to your proposals,
not your lamentations.
These five pages are to remind you
that we are still insolvent.
It is impossible
to implement reforms
while austerity continues.
And while the debt is not restructured.
You want our poor people
to pay for your rich pensions?
The Minister's list
is comprehensive enough
to serve as the basis for an agreement.
I suggest we leave his debt proposals
for another time.
The Greek minister is trapping us
with empty proposals.
This debt must be paid!
A debt is a debt is a debt!
Ten minutes!
Wolfgang and Angela are at war.
Either the President falls...
or we do.
The German left the room.
Is he leaving too?
Thank you.
I know. I understand your opposition,
but I think
that an intermediate agreement
would end this current stalemate.
I appreciate your gesture but...
By the way, I'm not your enemy.
But I cannot accept
any change to the MoU.
We need to remain committed to the
MoU, which is the only legitimate basis
on which we can responsibly deal
with each other in the future.
So, shall we resume?
I think we should approve this list.
I agree with Christine.
Me too.
I disagree.
- You have your majority.
- I think so.
I expect the signed agreement
with your list of reforms
in three days, not in five, okay?
As to the number of pages,
no limit.
That will be all for today.
We have a new agenda
and our banks stay open.
In the spirit
of constructive ambiguity.
Athens Airport
The Troika, the institutions...
We are highly dissatisfied
with our new setup.
You've got an entire floor,
at the Hilton.
This will be dealt with
by our superiors.
For now, we've come to request files
of the ports and the naval shipyards,
to put them up for sale.
You are mere civil servants.
You've come to demand files
from the Minister?
That is what we've always done.
From now on, you'll have to place
your requests to our civil servants.
This is an ideological decision.
My superiors won't understand that.
I will explain to your superiors.
Out.
And what if I have questions for you?
You'll have to put them
to my civil servants,
and I will give my answers
to your superiors.
I understand.
Brussels says
we disrespect its institutions.
You mean the Troika!
They have a floor at the Hilton.
They won't invade
our ministries anymore.
It's in the intermediate agreement.
Christine fears for their safety.
100 police officers
ensure their security 24/7.
Your agreement of relative ambiguity...
Constructive ambiguity.
Half of our representatives
won't vote for it.
Half of ours plus the opposition
and it'll pass.
Not if we don't rehire the fired,
restore salaries and pensions
and stop privatizations.
It's an intermediate agreement.
It's a first step
towards what we all want.
Start by refusing the debt.
Refusing it is in no way political...
From the President of the Eurogroup.
"Your list of demands
for the intermediate agreement"
"must be compatible
with MoU for renegotiation."
Wolfgang is back in command.
Parliament will not vote
for anything MoU-related.
Go to Parliament and explain it.
I could sign the agreement
and bypass Parliament.
Ten years in jail.
Can I sign it?
You can't.
Only the Minister signs for Eurogroup.
I'll deal with it.
Sir.
The President of the Council of State.
Sir, what is your verdict?
Mr. Prime Minister...
Letters from the Minister to creditors
asking to make a deal...
must be endorsed by Parliament.
Your judicial council told me
it concerns
the extension of an agreement.
But a letter like this, as you know,
will create a precedent.
We need a decree
giving the Minister the right...
to sign.
So prepare the decree.
Wolfgang took control again.
You must call Angela.
They're like kids
waiting for Santa Claus.
He took a taxi at the airport.
He wants to be incognito.
Why all this mystery?
Angela doesn't want
his presence here known.
I really don't know.
The Prime Minister didn't give a hint.
He said to listen to him
before speaking.
Angela is sending
someone we can trust.
- Is there any tarama?
- Of course.
Someone with solutions.
Calm down.
Hello, good evening, welcome.
I am...
Good evening.
I'm happy to be here,
although I don't know why I'm here.
The person who sent you
must have explained.
I have no idea who sent me.
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.
I just found a note at my office
instructing me to board
the first plane to Athens.
Are you having something to drink?
Not for now, thank you.
Wiez,
your decision to bring back the MoU
is just undoing
the progress we've made.
Only the Chancellor who sent you
can unlock this process.
I didn't know Angela knew I was coming.
Look, the return of the MoU
only means one thing:
it means new taxes,
new cuts in wages and pensions,
which will lead
to reduced consumer spending
and that will cause
small businesses and shops
to close, raising unemployment,
and leading to reduced consumer
spending furthermore, so...
And tax revenues.
It's a vicious circle.
If your policy doesn't change,
we are facing social and political
regression for the next 10 years...
Politically it's a complete disaster.
What do we tell our people?
Our voters? We were elected
to change this, to fight against it.
We've done 4/5 of the way
with you guys.
You have to take one step,
you have to give us something.
There's nothing going on.
Nothing changes.
That's in the remit of the Troika,
as everyone calls them.
Talk to them.
He was playing with us.
Angela had sent him to shut off one
by one all possibilities of dialogue.
Gentlemen, dinner is served, please.
That looks delicious.
Thank you.
Your tzatziki
is absolutely delicious, super.
Wiez savored the dishes
with evident pleasure
as we explained
our arguments and our fears
about lack of liquidity
for our banks.
The IMF is no group of bandits.
They have to be paid.
Fantastic.
No. With the fingers.
Like that.
Now, as I said before,
the IMF has to be paid.
Dig everywhere.
Take the reserves of the pension funds.
They own vast sums.
But that's already gone.
The retirement funds,
the university funds,
all kind of pensions,
already drained dry
by the previous governments.
Operating under the Troika's
directives.
Well...
It lasted almost five hours
without Wiez
making the slightest concession
to our demands for more democracy
in the Eurogroup,
and for more control of the Troika.
Our insistence served no purpose
whatsoever.
We need you to understand that...
You don't know what it is to inherit
a gigantic crisis
with no European experience.
Well, you have it now.
Your tenacity has been noted
in Brussels.
And your antagonism
facing European ministers
who have neither
your worldly experience
nor your debating talent.
Is that a problem?
I thought the Eurogroup
was a forum for free debate.
Freedom is an essential
concept for our democracies.
But freedom has to be superseded
by a system of order.
It's a very official trip...
It's about to start.
They want to shut our banks
and she greets him like a king.
What's behind it?
He mustn't fall under Angela's spell.
Alexis isn't easy game.
Angela Merkel, the soft power.
She studies her guest's character
to better seduce him.
Nice coat.
She wants to rebrand
her country's image.
I don't think so.
Angela has one strategy:
divide and conquer.
The meeting between the Prime Minister
and the Chancellor lasted six hours.
Six hours!
Let's see the outcome.
We both understood each other.
We have major differences
but her desire for change was clear,
after reading your 27 pages
for which she congratulated me.
Are you sure she's sincere?
She gives the least
to take the most.
Sincere, I can't say.
Pragmatic, yes.
You'll never guess what she told me.
"Replace Yanis"
"and negotiations will go much better."
I told her, "I agree."
"If you replace Wolfgang."
She never brought it up again.
What else did you decide,
besides to keep us?
To create another level of discussion,
less prone to Eurogroup gridlock.
A brilliant trick to divide us.
You and I will introduce our ideas.
Meanwhile
the next Eurogroup meeting is in Riga.
- Your orders?
- Stand firm on our decisions.
And on your 27 pages.
The Riga meeting is informal.
Riga
And now, let's go
to our correspondent in Riga.
Our reception was held in honor
of the Eurogroup and its 19 ministers,
one of whom is noticeably absent:
the controversial
Greek Finance minister
often criticized for his great tenacity
in negotiating
and his unseemly love of the media.
We were there.
Both of us.
This one is smaller than mine.
They put me here for the view.
They separated us.
What is going on?
We're together, go ahead.
I talked to Angela.
Stand your ground.
Don't give an inch.
Let us move on the agenda.
Greece.
It's a pity, Yanis,
that you've replaced your deputy.
But we'll proceed with what we have.
Are we starting?
As in the past,
the Greek government and its ministers
must collaborate with the Troika
at both the technical
and political levels.
Political dossiers to the ministers,
technical dossiers to the bureaucrats.
The Troika must recover
its full freedom of action.
Before your election,
Greece was recovering
and your debt was sustainable.
Now it's no longer sustainable
and deficits are rising.
The debt is unsustainable. Billions
of it should've be written off.
Your country cannot recover
without reducing the debt.
Without the Troika,
no reforms
and no liquidity for your banks.
This will lead to closure of your banks
and to an exit from the Eurozone.
And that will not affect the economy
of other European countries.
The exit of any one country
from the Eurozone
will be a seismic shock
to all the others.
There's a contradiction there.
Minister, wait for your turn to speak.
We are ready to help Greece,
but Greece does not want help.
Maybe the time has come
to talk consequences.
As if we have moved too fast
in the wrong direction.
I cannot imagine any solution
outside of the agreed MoU.
Our government will do
whatever it takes
to remain within the Union
and the Eurozone,
sustainably.
Minister,
you must grant the Troika
complete freedom.
You must agree not to legislate
without the Troika's consent
and forget
about an intermediate agreement.
I expect the signed agreement
with your list of reforms
in three days, not five, okay?
As to the number of pages, no limit.
That will be all for today.
The meeting is over.
Some call the Greek minister a gambler,
an amateur, a timewaster.
Is that so?
It was a key discussion emphasizing
a sense of urgency around the table.
Their ideological rigidity
derailed negotiations
and will cost them dearly.
This is off the record.
I'll save it for my book.
The Minister of Finance is unorthodox.
His taste for courting the media
terminates the debates.
He's the one
that should be kicked out.
We need a Yanixit!
Wait, one moment please!
Are you running away from them?
They call you a timewaster, an amateur.
I've never run away from anything.
When the fate
of a suffering people is at stake,
we might take some time.
They say you're alone at every turn.
I have the confidence
of my Prime Minister
and of the people of my country,
which is enough for me.
You skipped the official dinner.
Are you fleeing their hostility?
I was at the official dinner yesterday.
This evening
I'm dining with my team.
They say you'll be replaced.
I just said I have the confidence of
my Prime Minister. Thank you very much.
The Minister refused to respond.
He claimed to have been
at the official dinner.
We caught him fleeing away
from the other ministers
and away from our questions
with irrelevant responses.
He is alone,
unable to command respect.
Thank you, Victor.
My character assassination has begun.
If my replacement can help...
We are like a hand-knit sweater.
They pull on one loose thread.
Taking you down will take me down.
We're in this together.
Good job in Riga.
Here's the proof.
The Eurogroup President
demands that you be replaced.
Fuck him!
Your fault.
You let him address you directly.
I'll tell him you're his sole contact.
- You wrote the President?
- I have news.
He called me twice.
Sit.
I received two calls
from the Eurogroup president.
He'll speak only to Yorgos.
We won't let them decide,
but we can't keep saying no.
According to Angela,
things are at a stand-off
between Yanis and Wolfgang.
And the stand-off
has blocked negotiations.
I'll sacrifice Nicholas
and replace him with Yorgos.
Yorgos is excellent.
Brussels likes him.
He'll reach agreements.
Surrender agreements.
Nicholas is an intellectual,
a perfect collaborator...
but he's not right for complex talks.
Efklis backed the choice of Yorgos
without once uttering his name.
And despite detesting him both
as a politician and as a human being.
You surrendered to the Troika!
No! I'm buying time
to reach the agreement we want.
Some want to vote for the MoU.
- That won't happen.
- It will.
Disaster!
Eurogroup, the people, the press,
public opinion: all against us!
We need a break.
And you'll oversee everything closely.
As a stooge?
As a man I count on.
Sit down.
140,000 people voted for you.
142,000.
Whatever you say. 142,000.
Why are you laughing?
Resigning is a betrayal of their trust.
No, I'd betray their trust if I stayed.
I can't hear!
Betrayal is staying
and not fulfilling my promises.
Always the last word!
Here? Is this your surprise?
Don't like having dinner with friends?
Love it.
The wine, thank God.
Thank you.
Who wants red?
- Me.
- Me too.
- Who starts?
- I'll pour.
Someone start explaining
the point of this charming...
but conspiratorial meeting.
You got 150,000 votes...
- 142,000.
- Bravo!
More than anyone else.
And you'd abandon them
with a nice letter?
And blab on TV.
It is a conspiracy!
After your promises for change.
A well-organized conspiracy.
They'll blame you
for everything that goes wrong.
They already do.
Guys...
Half of the cabinet,
even more,
wants to sign the MoU.
But they were elected
to end austerity, rebuild wages,
reduce unemployment, raise salaries,
nationalize the banks,
tax the wealth of the Church...
You want something?
What do you want?
Speak!
What did you decide?
I have to ask her first.
She doesn't like politics.
- Sorry.
- No, come in.
Come, sit down.
This way.
Signing a new austerity program?
Sakis and Yorgos
think we'll get a good agreement.
It's a capitulation.
They say
we'll get significant debt relief.
The more concessions you make,
the more they will demand.
We were elected to relieve the country
of crippling austerity.
Know what it means to reimburse
3.5% surplus over 10 years?
Constant crisis.
Except for oil-producing countries,
a 3.5 surplus is not sustainable
over the course of 10 years.
Angela wants to see me.
I need you.
I must make important decisions.
I'm going to Brussels.
Come ASAP.
Our secret service
think you work for Wolfgang
to exit the Euro.
So does Manos.
What about you?
I don't.
See you in Brussels.
Good evening, sir.
Welcome to Brussels.
- What is this?
- A Greek fest.
Kim!
What are you doing here?
This is what being Greek is all about?
This is the one thing
the Germans can't take away.
So, what are you doing in Brussels?
Let's have dinner.
I want to talk to you.
Yanis, I have to meet Yorgos.
He's with Wiez and Costello.
Are you meeting the Troika
without telling me?
Yanis, Yorgos is with Sakis.
They asked me to join them urgently.
I was ambushed by the Greeks.
Does the Prime Minister know?
- The Prime Minister?
- He can't be disturbed.
I must see him! It's urgent.
Yorgos is meeting the Troika.
With Wiez!
Lay off him.
You bother me for this?
Excuse me.
Yorgos is of no importance anymore.
Referendum-time. Only you know.
A Grexit is out of the question.
Don't change your plans.
We'll talk.
I arranged to meet Wolfgang
in private,
to be able to talk off the record.
A present from German schoolchildren.
I told them I'd give them to you.
Chocolate,
it's good against depression.
Well, you have
to take some too because...
I'm about to say...
Our economy is collapsing
due to your persistent blockades.
You lend us money to reimburse
the debt that we owe you.
On that loan
we pay you an interest.
Now Mario and his ECB are making
almost a billion a year,
thanks to Greek debt.
And what could be the solution?
I think you already know.
And it's only up to you.
But let me sum it up for you:
far-reaching institutional reforms
in an economy revitalized
by a debt restructure.
But there is a solution:
sign the MoU or exit the Euro.
Suppose I sign your MoU.
6 to 12 months down the line,
the country will again be facing
the same economic abyss.
Your Prime Minister must accept
a time-out from the Euro,
temporarily.
Except your Chancellor
has excluded this possibility.
Yes, which obliges you to sign the MoU.
I believe your Prime Minister
is dreaming of a referendum.
No referendum is planned.
There'll be one in two weeks
or three months.
To stay in the Euro or to get out.
But the majority of our people
want to stay in the Euro.
Then they should vote "Yes"
and sign the MoU.
If you vote "No",
it's Grexit.
Wolfgang, please, do me a favor.
You have been an insider in politics
for almost 40 years.
I've only been for about four months.
So if you can just stop telling me
what to do
and instead offer me your advice.
If you were me,
would you sign this MoU?
As a patriot...
No.
It's bad for your people.
It will not allow you to recover.
You believe that the Eurozone
is unsustainable as it is,
that political union is necessary.
That's correct.
But, for now,
we have to impose
the rules to save the Euro.
You'll serve as an example
to discipline the others.
Your Prime Minister talks
to our Chancellor all the time.
There is nothing she can offer him.
His choice is simple: MoU or Grexit.
I feel hooked like a swordfish.
They reel me in, let me go.
They reel me in...
let me go.
This referendum is our freedom.
But a referendum is not enough.
We must prepare for what's coming.
People want you fired.
The right blames you
for destroying our economy.
I did it with your agreement.
We'll share a jail cell.
I am their target. The end of the left.
Wiez says you won't last long.
He's wrong.
I want you by my side.
I'm calling for a referendum.
I must inform the cabinet
and the Parliament.
You two stay here for the Eurogroup.
Total secrecy until I announce it.
I need all of you.
A referendum. To win or to lose it?
If we win, do we quit the EU?
A Yes-or-No referendum
on Eurogroup's ultimatum.
They'll close our banks.
Merkel promised they won't.
NO
YES
NO
YES
The referendum is insane.
Yes, but anyway, what are we going
to do after the referendum?
Why a referendum?
To win it or to lose it?
The announcement of a referendum
renders the discussions with you
null and void.
We'll continue without you.
The referendum is an internal matter.
It does not affect
our discussions here.
We want our people to decide
on the debate we're having.
Yes, but how can you make
common people decide
such complex economic issues?
Do the people
really know their interests?
We are strong believers
in our people's capacity
to think and decide on their own.
Our only request for today
is for Mario's ECB
to extend liquidity to our banks
until the day after the referendum.
After all, this is ECB's duty.
This is out of the question.
ECB decisions
are independent of politics.
Mario, could you please answer?
The decision to switch off liquidity
is ours to make at any time.
Which implies
the closing of our banks,
and so your political interference
in our referendum.
The next meetings
will take place without you.
What do the statutes say?
Can he exclude us from meetings?
With this referendum, our people
will indicate to our Prime Minister
the direction he must take.
Either break off negotiations,
which will lead to nothing,
or sign the MoU.
Minister, the Eurogroup has
no statutes, no legal existence.
The decisions are made
by the President.
So your decisions,
our decisions...
have no legality.
They are arbitrary.
Our decisions are accepted
by all the governments of the Union!
We need adults in this room.
Yes?
I'm coming.
Coming.
The banks shut.
Great publicity for the "Yes".
We'll sign the MoU...
Please open our banks!
Let's sign it.
They'll leave us in peace!
If the banks shut due to cash shortage,
there will be riots.
We'll be
at the anti-Troika demonstrations.
Us in the streets?
The government does not demonstrate.
Can we apply your withdrawal limit
of 60 euros a day?
Yes.
- Can we hold on?
- Until the referendum.
Good.
Let's go for the 60-euro limit.
Tell me.
- How's Plan B coming along?
- Ready to go.
And?
Transitioning to a new currency
will be painful.
But I doubt
they'll kick us out of the Euro.
Look what we have here.
We just found 16 billion.
Three years ago, the ECB
airlifted 16 billion for our ATMs.
They dispatched it to different banks
and forgot.
Great find, but useless.
Why useless?
It can keep our banks open.
That's theft.
It belongs to the ECB.
Theft...
If my child is starving,
I can steal some milk.
A leftist government stealing?
Corrupt, like our predecessors.
We can nationalize it.
For our suffering people.
If we quit the Euro,
we can nationalize this money.
We won't quit the euro
or become thieves.
Go for the 60 euros a day.
With the announcement
of the referendum,
the ECB cut cash-flow to Greek banks,
forcing them to close.
This resulted in economic asphyxiation.
I will ask the Greek people
to vote "Yes",
because...
their vote will send...
a signal both for Greece
and the Eurozone.
Assholes!
They'll make them vote "No"!
If "Yes" wins, it will save the country
from the bankruptcy
the left drove it into.
If "Yes" wins, I quit.
"Yes" means: accept the MoU.
We'll continue the struggle.
We've achieved so much!
"Yes" may offer a solution.
And some people may accept it.
It will end up in the Troika's hands.
The opposite of our goal.
And if "No" wins?
They'll kick us out of the Euro!
With the country behind us,
they won't dare.
If they do,
we start a new currency and we fight.
It was a way of reminding
the Prime Minister of our promises.
I understood his difficulties,
his fears, his distress,
caught like a swordfish.
That image haunted me.
The evening of the referendum
has arrived.
Everyone expects
"Yes to the MoU" to win.
Some people in the government
even hope for it.
It would be an alibi for them
to stay in power.
In less than an hour,
an earthquake of huge magnitude
will hit Europe.
And we'll get trapped
in a prison of debt with no bounds.
Serving the brutal Troika...
Unless we have a "No".
A massive "No".
Whichever side wins,
I still need you.
Manos thinks...
I'm blocking any agreement.
If it's "No",
they must accept our agreement.
They'll try to make you capitulate,
at any cost.
All of them.
A political vision needs time.
Quitting is the death of the visionary
and the vision.
Surely.
The victory of the "Yes"
is a conclusion and a solution.
If we quit, the left disappears.
If the left stays,
it will implement right-wing politics.
It's better if it disappears.
To be reborn.
Now the results.
Ten,
nine,
eight,
seven,
six,
five,
four,
three,
two,
one...
YES 31%
NO 25%
The people are always right.
Even when wrong.
YES 35%
NO 36%
We passed!
YES 38%
NO 47%
Things are moving forward, that's good.
I'm caught like a swordfish.
The Germans will destroy us.
He's a megalomaniac.
Only cares about his career.
Austerity will be eradicated
by the growth austerity brings.
Do not resign. You mustn't.
If we resign, we'll be crushed.
Your Prime Minister talks
to our Chancellor all the time.
There's nothing she can offer him.
Do we quit the Euro?
A new currency will be painful.
No one wants to leave the Euro!
MoU or Grexit.
Yes.
The Chancellor.
Yes?
It's a trap.
The Chancellor is waiting
with all the other Heads of State,
outraged over your referendum
and your victory.
Brussels European Council
The Prime Minister signed the MoU.
The Finance Minister resigned.
The Greek Parliament voted
the MoU at 73%.
The people were overthrown.
The crisis continues...
The people...
The people survives heroically.
