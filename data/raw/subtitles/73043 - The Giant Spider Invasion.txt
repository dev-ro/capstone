Sheriff.
Hi, little buddy.
Hey, what's happening?
Oh, nothin' much.
I thought I'd stop by and see
if you had a scoop for the paper
Well, things are pretty
quiet around here, Davy.
Oh?
Well, you know I always
have things under control.
Well, I guess there's nothin'
goin' on in this neck
of the woods except the revival
over in Gleason Town Hall
- You goin'?
- No. Are you?
No. I got me
a date with Terry.
Well, I'm surprised that
Dan Kester would let you
anywhere near her.
He's her brother-in-law,
not her father.
Well, don't get on the wrong
side of him, young fella.
He's a strange man and he's
workin' up a big head of steam.
Dan?
Where the hell are you goin"?
In to town.
What the hell for?
Well, I'm goin' to a revival.
Well, you need it.
Git!
Sometimes, the only way
I know you're still alive
is when I hear you
flush the toilet.
- Hallelujah!
(in unison) Hallelujah!
The joy that you're feelin'
right now is just the beginning.
Our revival is gonna grow and
grow for the next four days.
Days that are gonna change
your lives.
HI, Terry ready yet?
No, not quite.
You want a little drink?
Oh, no thanks, Mrs. Kester.
I'll just wait right here.
Well, you can call me
Ev, Dave.
Okay, Ev.
Sure you don't want one?
- No, uh, I'm sure.
Terry might be quite
a while yet.
You know, you and Terry don't
look much alike for sisters.
But I gotta say that good
looks run in your family.
Well, thank you, Dave.
You know, it's too bad that
there's this little
age difference between us.
If you were five years older,
I'd jump ya.
Terry!
Hey, you look great.
Doesn't she, Mrs. Kester?
Yeah.
Come on, Terry.
(phone rings)
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
I see. Uh, huh.
Disturbing the peace?
Yes, ma'am, that's an
arrestable of fence.
No, the law does not apply
to preaching.
Hellfire and brimstone, that is
what is in store for you!
It's right here, Psalms 11.6,
"Upon the wicked, He shall reign
fire and brimstone. "
Dutch? Dutch, this is Ev.
Listen, there's not a drop
of booze left in this house.
I, I just can't stand it,
I'm really desperate.
Would you bring me something?
Oh, thanks, Dutch. Listen...
listen, you'll find me
very appreciative when you get here.
Okay, bye-bye-
Well, here we are.
You've got to be kidding!
You said park.
Come here.
Can you come again
tomorrow night?
Well, I certainly hope so.
The revival will be still here.
Gimme that old time religion.
Boy, I can hardly wait to get
saved again tomorrow night.
- Oh, Dan, wait.
- Huh?
You forgot your back braces.
Whoa, damn, it's good you
remembered that.
Ooh, boy, if I went home
without that on, there would
be hell to pay.
"I saw a star fall from heaven
onto the earth and there arose
such a smoke out of the pit
as a smoke from a great furnace.
And out of the smoke there came
locusts upon the earth
and unto them was given power. "
How was it?
Grr... eat.
What did the preacher...
talk about?
Sin.
Yeah, what did he have
to say about it?
He, uh, was against it.
Listen, damn it, you better tell
me what that preacher said
because I don't for a minute
believe this rotten,
stupid story of yours.
Look at that! Oh!
Aagh! Aah!
What the hell was that?
Weird.
Geez, would you listen
to that wind.
Lights are dead.
What's wrong?
Car won't start either.
- Oh, great!
- Wait here, Terry.
Terry, come on!
Come on.
(Terry screams)
Oh!
What the
goddamn hell was that?
(strange screeching noises)
It was a shooting star,
maybe, huh?
Well, there's... there's nothin'
there now.
No fire, no... no smoke,
no smell, no sound, nothin.
Well, you saw it too. It wasn't
just me, you saw it.
There must be somethin'
out there.
Well, whatever it is, it can
keep til mornin'.
You mean to say that all hell
just busted loose in our field
and you're goin' on in to bed?
I'm tired.
Well, you're always tired.
Well, that revival really took
it out of me.
Now, if you want to, you can
stay out here all night
lookin' at nothing.
(command center chatter)
Our radar's on the fritz.
We are off our vector.
Hey, you know there's something
screwy going on up here.
We're only 35 knots above our
stalling speed,
you better take a quick dive.
(command center chatter)
Still dropping.
(alarms and bells sounding)
(phone rings)
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
Huh? I see.
You say your radio won't work.
Well, all I call tell you is
call Joe's Radio Shop.
He opens at 9 a.m. sharp.
Your car won't start? Well,
all I can tell you
is call Ernie's Auto Repair, he
opens at 8:00.
No, ma'am, I don't have
the number.
All I can tell you is use the
Yellow Pages.
Let your fingers do the walking,
ha,ha,haâ€œ.
(dial tone)
That's funny, I wonder why she
hung up on me?
(strange electronic noises)
Don't move or I'll shoot.
Jesus, 'bout scared the death
outta me.
Put the gun away.
- What the hell are ya doin'
sneakin' in here at this hour?
I had to walk home.
I warned ya, that little Perkins
snot is rotten.
It wasn't Dave's fault, h
is car broke down.
Ha, you fell for that dumb
old trick?
Ha, ha, that had whiskers
on it when I was a kid. Ha!
It really did break down.
- Yeah, where?
- In the junkyard.
Hmm, that's just exactly where
a horny little punk
like that would park,
in a junkyard.
I hate to burst your bubble,
but it was my idea.
I oughta put you over my knee,
and pull down your britches
and spank the hell out of ya.
Oh! I always wondered why you
used to spank me so much,
so you could get your jollies.
Why you...
Man can't even have any peace
in his own house.
Yes, this is Dr. Langer from
Montclair Observatory again.
I've got a gamma ray shower
and the barometer's dropped
an inch in less than 20 minutes.
That's unprecedented, right,
fight
And none of the other phenomena
I'm reporting correlate
with any previously observed date
in this area.
Did I ever tell you
you're gorgeous?
Not recently.
Paul, how many times do I have
to tell you,
you talk to plants to make
them grow.
- Talk to plants?
- Right.
Not you, Vance. You haven't
fallen for that metaphysical
nonsense.
- Well, my M.O. says
that I am half metaphysics and
half astrophysics.
Now, what made you take the long
walk down the hall?
More freaky stuff from northern
Wisconsin.
Freaky.
- We just got a report in that's
right out of Ripley.
And what's the source?
Montclair Observatory and
Dr. J. Langer.
Langer?
For openers, "We have a heavy
gamma ray shower,
an incredibly fast drop
in barometric pressure,
an aurora with no sun activity
and an amazingly potent
unknown ground level x-ray
source nearby. "
Paul, didn't we receive a SAC
report on a fouled-up B52?
Yeah.
Was it in the same quadrant?
Oh, you're right.
It was... right here, then it
disappeared off the radar scope.
Any report of a crash
in that area?
No.
- What's the closest town?
Horton. You better pack
your suitcase.
I'm wearin' it, old buddy.
Good, cause I've all ready
arranged your transportation.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
(phone ringing)
Seven o'clock already?
No, it's, uh, 6:02.
Well, what... oh, not you again.
Okay, what's up, Rider?
Well, we just got a report
an oil freighter
in the middle of Lake Superior.
Oh, that's beautiful. Did you
check on the car fairies
on Lake Michigan?
No, no, Vance, this is serious.
A couple of the seamen
upon board the ship, saw a
plane crash...
Oh?
- and it just might be ours.
Any sign of survivors?
- We don't know.
Okay, Dave, keep in touch.
Oh, uh, Rider... uh, what time
am I supposed to meet this uh,
uh... Langer at the observatory?
You're expected at 9:00 sharp.
Nine I can make, but if I don't
get some shut-eye,
I ain't gonna be very sharp.
Bye,
Good-bye.
It's way past 7:00 already.
- So.
So, when the hell are you gonna
get off your big, fat ass
and go see what happened in our
pasture last night?
Let me eat my breakfast
in peace.
I gotta keep up my strength.
What for?
The more usual kinds of stars
are what we astronomers call
the "main sequence" stars
and they run the gamut
from the blue giants to the
red dwarfs.
And then the more fascinating
stars we call "abnormal" stars.
Then we have the white dwarfs
and they have a radius
of less that 1/100th of our
sun's and a density so great
that even a teaspoon of this
matter would weigh tons
and it could only be lifted
by a giant crane.
Then there are the quasars,
neutron stars and black holes
or collapsed stars. Now, let me
show you my conception
of the creation of this universe.
Out of this primordial
fireball, the galaxies, planets
and stars of our universe were
created.
As you can see, our sun is
but one small star in a galaxy
such as this.
Now, a galaxy consists of not
only the stars
that we talked about, but also
great swirling masses of dust
and gas out of which the stars
were formed
and to which they ultimately
return. But now,
let's go back to the collapsed
stars or the neutron stars,
quasars or black holes as we
continue with this series,
you'll learn many things about
these various stars...
Hi.
- Hello.
I'm Dr. J. R. Vance from NASA.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here,
Doctor. I'm Jenny Langer.
Nice to meet you. I have
an appointment with your father.
Oh, no, no, he passed away
in 1952.
Oh, I'm so sorry, then the
appointment
must be with your husband.
- Not married.
- I'm not sorry.
- Ha.
Uh, then it's probably
with your brother.
No, my brother's an interior
decorator in Oshkosh.
You see, Dr. Vance, I'm afraid
your appointment is with me.
I'm Dr. Jenny Langer.
Oh?
- And we have some very
important business to discuss.
Yes, we do.
Ever been here before?
- No, but it's beautiful,
the trees, the green foliage.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, I'm very fond
of plants.
Oh?
- You know what we have
at NASA?
- No, what?
Green tile and chrome.
- Ha ha ha.
You don't look the type.
Well, Doctor, you want
to clue me in?
I'd certainly like to. You see,
it was after the lecture
last night, Mr. Vance, that I,
I suddenly discovered there
were many peculiar things
happening.
Yeah, like the gamma ray shower,
- Uh-huh.
The aurora and the barometer
dropping like Wall Street.
Exactly and that's when I made
those urgent calls to NASA.
Frankly speaking, I'm very
concerned.
Well, frankly speaking,
Doctor, so is the
United States Government.
I'm still measuring an x-ray
shower from the ground level
at a magnitude never before
measured on earth
except in nuclear explosions.
Well, Doctor, it could be an
abortive strike from a...
unfriendly power.
Oh, come on! You don't think
a missile landed here.
Well, that's one possibility,
yes.
It could have been a falling
object like a meteorite,
not a missile.
Doctor, a meteorite would
have made a tremendous
explosion.
- Uh-huh.
Well, maybe it was an explosion.
Hello, Doctor.
- Anything new?
Nothing.
- Uh, Mary, this is Mr. Vance
from NASA, Mary Johnson.
- Hello, Mary.
Doctor, your water's,
uh, boiling.
Mary must have forgotten it.
Would you like some tea?
Tea? Heh, that's not my brand.
Oh, here are the reports
from last night.
Now, let's see what happens
today.
Mm-hmm.
- And over here.
Oh... look at this.
- Wow!
Radiation level's still high.
- Um-hmm.
Whatever landed hasn't
gone away.
You know, Doctor, I think I will
have that tea.
Ha ha, okay.
I told you there was nothin'
out here. See, there's nothin'.
Yeah. So, why are you carrying
your, your gun?
Aw, shut up!
My father always said tryin'
to teach you to run a farm
was like tryin' to teach an ox
to use a typewriter.
Ever since you've been runnin'
the place,
everything's gone wrong.
Umph, I...
(ear-splitting scream)
Now, watch.
(modulating sound)
See.
(modulating sound)
I just don't understand it.
Those radiation levels are far
too lethal.
Anyone anywhere near the initial
impact point
would be in great danger.
What would be the safest way to
find the exact point of impact?
Maybe we could use a helicopter.
No, no, be too dangerous.
- But...
Doctor, we have already lost
one airplane crew.
I didn't know that.
Well, back to the tea.
- Back to the tea.
There's another one.
I can't tell what kinda critter
coulda done that.
Eight dead cows and a calf.
You realize what this is gonna
cost us?
It ain't gonna cost us nothin'.
Nine dead animals ain't gonna
cost us nothin'?
You're so dumb, you wouldn't
know rabbit turds
from Rice Krispies.
I'll butcher up the meat like I
always do and I'll sell it
to Dutch's Cafe.
You don't even know what killed
those cows.
There might be somethin'
horrible wrong with the meat.
Well, that's Dutch's lookout,
not mine.
I've never seen so much fouled
up data in my life.
It's against every known law
of physics.
Well, we've tried to brainstorm
it.
And it just won't brainstorm.
- Right.
What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Doctor.
- Hmm?
Do you have a Geiger counter?
- Yeah, in the other office.
Good, let's see if your local
sheriff will support us.
Sheriff Jones, ha ha ha, our
jolly red giant?
I know just where he is.
Let's go.
You're going to love him.
You know he believes
in Velikovsky's Theory,
that the moon came out of the
Pacific Ocean.
So do I.
Hey, there's another one.
That's thirteen head, Dutch
isn't gonna want that much meat.
So, I'll freeze some of it up
and then sell it to him later.
Hey, look at this.
I've never seen a rock like that
around here.
There's another one.
It's really weird.
Wow, look at that.
I told you something landed
here last night.
Wonder what they are?
You know you can't tell
from the outside.
We better bust one open.
And good morning to you all.
(in unison) Morning.
Hey, Helga, you're lookin'
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
You must've had some kind of a
heavy date last night, huh?
You better believe it.
- One of the loggers?
That's my secret.
- Ha ha ha...
Well, Dutch, you got that
limburger cheese smile
on your face again this morning.
Have trouble last night?
Yeah.
- One of the loggers?
What does that mean?
- I don't know,
I've got trouble myself. Seemed
like everyone was calling
up with some cockamamie little
thing, a car wouldn't start,
the radio wouldn't work. And the
preacher man, he kept everybody
awake last night.
When does that gospel monger
go on?
I don't know, but I'll tell ya,
he may work for God,
but he sure hollers like the
devil. Ha ha ha...
Helga, ha ha ha.
Breakfast is ready.
- Oh, well, thank you.
Ooh, prunes. Ha ha.
Nope, it's not gonna work.
Go get me a hammer.
Not that one, the big one.
And a chisel.
Oh.
Git it yourself.
You never were any good
with a tool.
Hey, look!
It split.
They look like diamonds.
I don know.
May not be hard enough
to be a diamond.
Don't hit it, no, no! Diamonds
are supposed to cut glass.
That's right.
Look at that!
- Damn!
Hello.
Oh, hi, Dr. Langer.
How are you this morning?
- Fine.
Won't you join me, please?
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
This your brother from Oshkosh?
No, this is Dr. Vance from NASA.
Hello, Sheriff.
- NASA,
the National Aeronautics
Space Administration?
That Nassau?
- Um, yes, but it's NASA,
Houston, Texas.
- Sheriff, we have to talk
to you about last night's
disturbances.
Say no more, I'll get that
preacher man to tone
it down tonight.
- No, no, I don't mean
that disturbance.
- Oh, no?
Pardon me, Doctor.
One of our local spiders,
ha ha ha.
Uh, hey, what's that gizmo?
Uh, it's a Geiger counter.
A Geiger counter! We don't have
any geigers around here,
never did have in these parts.
- Uh, no, Sheriff, you
misunderstand me. See, Dr.
Geiger invented this to count
the nuclear...
- Oh, Vance, Vance,
I have a feeling the Sheriff's
putting you on.
I'm sure he's taken physics.
- Oh, I used to take physics,
but now I find that prunes
do the better job for me.
We'll be rich to heaven, ha ha
ha. We're gonna be rich.
What do you mean "we?"
This farm is mine and everything
that's on it is mine.
You know, nobody ever found
diamonds around here before.
Bet think they came out of that
weird fireball thing last night.
I'll take these into cousin
Billy at the rock shop.
He can tell me just exactly
what they're worth.
But don't, don't you tell cousin
Billy where you found 'em.
That'll be our secret.
Oh, don't look at me
like that, Dan.
You and are going to be rich.
Hey, listen, I never meant
any of those nasty things
I used to say to you,
I was, I was just teasing.
Honest. Everything can be
wonderful again,
just like it was before the
baby died.
Knock it off, Ev. We don't even
know if the diamonds are real.
Hi, Dr, Langer. Morning,
Sheriff.
Morning.
- Hello, dear.
May I join you?
- Please.
Thank you.
- This is Dave Perkins,
his father runs the local
newspaper.
Hello, Dave, nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
Dr. Vance from NASA.
Nassau,huh?
- NASA, Houston.
Oh. What brings you here?
Anything I can publish
in the paper?
- Oh, well...
That's classified.
Well, I'll put it in the
classified section.
Ha ha ha. Well, that's safe enough,
nobody reads your ads anyway.
Ha ha ha...
Oh, Dave, uh, could I speak
to you for a moment?
Sure, Dr. Vance. Excuse us.
Excuse us for a moment.
Is he always that serious?
- Well, he has something
to be serious about
at this time.
You know, I wonder if what
happened to Terry and I
last night had something to do
with what you're talking about?
What?
- What happened to you
and Terry?
- Well, we were parked
by the junkyard, the lights
went... they went dead,
the radio wouldn't work and
the engine wouldn't start.
A wind came up and started...
I don't know, everything
just went wrong.
You're hittin' the booze
again, huh?
Leave me alone, I feel terrible.
This place is full of spiders.
Yeah, I know, little pink ones.
- No, no, big, big, black,
hairy ones with furry legs
- Aha. Lay off the booze, Ev,
and they'll go away.
(phone rings)
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Cooper.
How are you?
Missing?
When'd you see him last?
You haven't seen him
since last night?
Well, I'll be glad to... drive
out and take a look for him.
What color is his motorcycle?
Come on, dear, please stop
worrying. I'm sure he'll turn
up safe and sound.
Yes, I'll get in touch with you.
Right, bye.
What's the matter with you?
You look like you could
use a drink.
I found another body.
Another cow?
- No, a human body.
A Person?
But it was chewed up worse
than them cattle.
We have to call the Sheriff.
Are you out of your mind?
Now, I buried that body
and I hid the motorcycle.
No one will ever know.
You hid it?
- We can't let that sheriff
come nosin' around here. What if
he finds the diamonds?
And... and all that grass we're
growing.
Well, you sound like you've been
smokin' the stuff yourself.
Ew, oh!
And every creeping thing, that
creepeth upon the earth,
shall be an abomination.
Only the pure of heart shall
be spared.
Oh, it's you.
- I told you I could
come again tonight.
- How'd you swing it, honey?
Well, I told the lush that I had
to come in and see my cousin
about some hot rocks.
- Ha ha ha...
(wolf howls)
(screaming)
(screams of terror)
Oh, oh!
( Screaming)
Hey, you forgot something.
No, I, I got it on.
- Your hot rocks.
Oh, thank you.
I always give you a big tip.
Oh, thank you, darling.
Ah, cousin Dan.
- Cousin Billy.
What brings you to town?
Hey, how's that hot little
tomato you're raisin'
out there, huh? Yeah, Terry's
way overripe for pickin',
you know?
- Oh, Terry's turnin' bad,
I can't control her anymore.
Oh well, she needs a
gentle hand, like mine.
Never mind about that now.
Here, I got somethin' I want
to show you. Wha-what is that?
That, that's a geode...
that's not from around here.
You must've found that down
south some place, huh?
Uh, take a look at these.
Just how good are these
diamonds here?
Now, just between you and me...
- Yeah, yeah.
Ha ha ha...
Sorry. They're... industrial
quality... yeah.
And the carbon content isn't
nearly as high as a...
a real diamond... a ring-type
diamond.
Come on, how, how much
are they worth?
Well, let's just say if you had
a bucket full of these,
a barrel full of these, yeah,
you might be rich.
Where'd you find these?
Let's, uh, just say they, uh,
fell outta the sky.
Ha ha...
(modulating sound)
What's going on now?
Those satellite reports you
asked Paul Rider to send.
Great.
Here.
Huh, latitude 45 degrees, 21
minutes west.
Correction, north.
Longitude 88 degrees, 42
minutes west. That's more
than a couple of square miles.
- I know, yeah.
Can't we pinpoint it closer
than that?
Not from Telcom. I'm afraid
you're going to have to use
a helicopter.
- Okay.
Get Paul Rider, please.
Oh, Where the hell is Ev?
I don't know.
Damn, Ev is messy. Doesn't
even clean.
Look at this here, cobwebs all
over everywhere.
Whole goddamn house is
filthy dirty.
Yeah well, Ev never was known
for her cleanliness.
Least my room is nice and tidy.
Maybe I should of married you
instead of her.
I was eleven years old.
Well, you're, uh, not any
eleven now.
Yeah, now I'm 35-24-35.
Ah, listen Terry, uh, I could,
uh, do things for you, if you
know what I mean.
You never did anything for Ev,
except drive her to drink.
Why don't you face it, you're
just a big, fat failure.
Not anymore.
- Bull.
So, that, uh, rich Perkins
punk, has he ever given you
a diamond?
- You know he hasn't.
This diamond... is yours,
if you treat me... nice.
(laughs)
You think you're gonna fool
me with that phony rhinestone?
That is real enough. All you
have to do is ask
cousin Billy at the rock shop.
Where would you get
a real diamond?
Oh, I... dug it up somewhere.
Hello.
Hi, Sheriff.
- Hi, Terry. ls Dan to home?
Dan.
Hi, Dan.
I'm checking out a missing
person's report, cause
Mrs. Cooper asked me to find
her husband and his motorcycle.
Now, she says he goes by here
a lot and he's been missing
for a day and a half. Have you
seen a motorcycle around here?
Nope.
Terry, you and Dave seen
or heard a motorcycle?
Uh-uh.
How about Ev?
- Drunk as a skunk.
Where is she?
- I don't know...
and I don't care.
Well, if either of you two see
or remember anything,
give me a jingle, will ya?
Ha ha ha... Boy, that chopper
makes nearly as much noise
as that preacher man. Ha ha ha.
I've located a radioactive
source, extremely high intensity
Can you pinpoint it?
- I'm over Bundy Road
and Copper Place.
That's near the Kester place.
What does it look like?
- The whole pasture down there
is distorted. Do you read me?
It's like I'm looking through on
the bottom of a pop bottle.
I mean it's blurred and twisted.
Get a picture of it.
- Uh, get a picture of it
and rush it to the lab, huh?
- Okay, will do.
It fits.
Space warp all right.
This must be the only energy
photogram of it's kind.
Well, what's a space warp?
Well, Dave, a space warp is a
gravitational pull, so intense,
that it makes a black hole
in space.
There's only one thing I know
of that could cause
a warp like this.
- A miniature black hole.
Uh huh.
- Could it happen?
Well, with a billion black holes
in our galaxy,
it's a wonder it hasn't
happened before.
Well, Dr. Vance, Dr. Langer,
I've got to be going. Thank you.
Bye, Dave.
Well, everything fits.
Einstein's general theory
of relativity.
- Mm hmm.
If a dead star collapsed all
it's masses, the star
would gradually shrink to a
point and...
disappear into another universe.
- Right, a parallel universe
with a door back and forth.
- That sucks everything up.
And throws everything out.
This may be our problem. Where
is this, uh-uh, Kester farm?
Oh, it's, uh, it's somewhere
in the Harrison Hills area,
right in here.
If it had not been the Lord
who was on our side,
then they had swallowed
us up quick.
Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah! (in unison)
Can I get off early tonight?
- Not before 9:00. Why?
I have an aunt coming
in from Barbasota.
Well, it's the same aunt
as last night.
Tell her she left a hickey
on your neck.
Hey, Dutch, what're we going
to do about those damn spiders?
I'm going to try to get
the preacher to exorcise them.
They're getting enough exercise
already.
Oh, boy.
Hi, Terry.
- What are you doing here?
Where's, uh, cousin Dan?
- He's not here and neither
is Ev.
- Pickup truck's still outside.
Well, maybe, but they're both
gone.
Oh, well, that's all right,
I guess. You can probably
help me out, hmm?
- Yeah and, uh,
maybe, you can, uh, help me.
Is this a real diamond?
Naw, it's a fake. Ah, I'll give
you five bucks for it.
I can always sell it to some
dumb tourist.
I don't believe you.
You didn't even look at it.
Ok... I'll give ya... $20, hmm?
And only because you're
my cousin.
You're Dan's cousin. You're no
relation of mine.
Then we can, uh, have relations,
hmm?
Billy, cut it out.
- Well, if we're not blood kin,
then let's be, uh, kissing
cousins, huh?
Billy, why don't you do what
I just did?
Yeah?
- Go home and take a cold shower
Uh, $40.
(screaming)
(screams)
(screaming)
(horn honks)
(screaming)
Did you hear the news?
Billy Kester's car just blew up.
He's dead?
- Yeah, he sure is,
deader than a doornail. You know
Dave, a lot of strange things
are happening around here.
- Yeah, I know, Dutch.
Can I use your phone?
Sure, use my private one
in back.
Thanks, Dutch.
- Okay.
This should be the area, Vance.
I don't see anything.
No count here.
Well, there has to be something.
- Well, it's a normal count.
Nothing dangerous.
The Kester phone is dead.
Listen, I think I'm going
to go on out there.
Okay.
- Bye.
Bob, Carl, Jack, Peter,
listen!
(screaming)
(screams)
Vance, what was that?
I didn't hear anything.
(gunshots)
That sounded like a
high-powered rifle.
This isn't hunting season.
Come on, let's get out of here.
(gunshot)
Oh... oh!
Oh, God!
Hurry, Vance.
It's all right.
Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.
Yeah, well, all hell's broken
loose. It's going to be hard
to keep the lid on now.
- Yeah, we know all about it,
Sheriff. May I have another
one, please?
Yeah, sure. My stomach
is doing flip-flops.
We just brought back what was
left of Joe Cooper.
Uh, Sheriff, if your stomach can
handle it...
we've got a 50 foot spider
out there on the loose.
Fifty foot spider!
- Fifty feet.
You mean that's what got
Joe Cooper?
Looks like our black hole has
turned into an open doorway
from hell.
And we're gonna have to find a
way to close it.
God knows how many monsters
may come through.
And how many have already
come through.
Doctor, please... what are these
gizmos. I found them
near the corpse.
You found them where?
- Near the corpse.
Uh, Sheriff, do you mind if we
take these and, uh, run some
tests of them.
- No, please do.
Oh, thank you. Do you have a
flare gun we could use?
Yes, you can pick one up at the
desk sergeant. He's got a
couple of flares out there.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Sheriff.
- Right.
We'll keep in touch.
- Thank you.
(phone rings)
Hello.
Yes, this is the sheriff.
(ambulance siren)
Oh, Davey, I... didn't recognize
your voice. What is it?
Is Terry all right?
Well, have Doc Oliphant check
her, will you?
And keep me filled in on
everything, please.
Thanks, Davey.
Fifty foot spider?!
Vance, I'm sorry to take so
long, but the lab said it will
a full two hours to get a
report on these.
The only thing they said was
they'd never seen
anything like them.
Could sure crack 'em open.
We don't have time for that.
First things first.
We've gotta find someway
to get out there
and kill that monster.
- Oh, how you gonna kill
a monster like this,
an alien energy pattern?
We haven't even found even
found the impact area
of the black hole.
- Mm hmm, and that's undoubtedly
where the spider's coming from.
- Right. The energy pattern has
to feed off of the gravitational
field of the black hole.
Vance, could we soak up
the energy?
We could feed it so much extra
mass we could choke it.
We can shower it with neutrons.
Neutron initiator.
It just might work.
What's up?
- I want you to fly me
a Caltech Neutron Initiator
right away.
Well, that's a pretty stiff
order.
And I mean right away, buddy!
I think there's one in Madison.
- Tell them to load it with a
six hundred gram charge and set
the pattern at 360 degrees.
My chopper will pick it up
at the airport.
All right.
- If it doesn't work,
then, old buddy, we got company
for dinner.
Three hours. Good-bye.
Well, it sounds like just
the ticket.
Um, tell me, how does one
of those gizmos work?
Yeah, sure.
Um, all right. Thanks, Vance.
I don't have to tell ya, you
know what happened
to the Kesters. Now, the
spider's nest is somewhere
on the Kester's ranch. We all
have guns. When we leave
here, we're gonna pick up all
the relatives, friends,
neighbors, anybody we can find.
And we're going to go out to the
Kester's farm and we're
going to destroy that spider!
So, come on, let's go.
(shouts of approval)
Hey. Hey, fellas, wait a minute.
Fellas, get around me.
Now, like I said inside, I want
each of you to go
in different directions and I
want you to get your friends,
relatives, anybody you can.
(loud shouts)
Dutch, what's goin' on?
All right, everybody just
hold it. Listen to me.
Listen, Dutch, you're a
troublemaker. I'm trying
to tell you to knock it off.
Now, everybody go home.
We're not going to get it
like this. Just knock it off!
Aw, you knock it off.
All right, let's go. Come on.
Let's go! Get in.
What's goin' on here?
Get outta here, go on home.
All right, everybody just...
everybody just...
(carnival music)
(screams of terror)
(phone rings)
Hello. Yeah, this is the sheriff.
What?
In Gleason.
Are you sure they're headed
this way?
Okay!
(screaming)
Hello, operator, give me
the National Guard
Headquarters in Madison.
All right, now that we found it,
now that we found it,
once you seal off the hole,
what's going to happen
to the spiders?
- That's their energy pattern.
That's their lifeline and once
we seal that off, they're gone.
But, what if the initiator
doesn't work? There's going
to be an army of those spiders
crawling around, growing
and multiplying.
Well, Jenny, it's already
happening.
Vance!
Come here.
Lord knows how many of those
things are around here.
Just take it easy.
Oh, look at this stuff.
Ugh! Agh! Oh!
What's the matter,
what'd you do?
Ooooh!
- Oh, my God!
God, another one.
- Let's get out of here.
Let's get back to the jeep.
- Yes!
How will I ever...
Patch me through to the Sheriff.
(phone rings)
Hello.
Yeah, Vance.
The spiders are all
over at Gleason,
just a few miles away.
Yes, I've called for the
National Guard, but the mobs
are beginning to gather
and they're getting out of hand.
Look, get somebody out here,
I just found another body
or what's left of one.
And for God's sake, keep that
mob away from here!
(mob sounds)
All right, you know why we're
all here, you're gonna know
we're gonna destroy that spider!
(cheers of approval)
And you've all got your
guns, they're all loaded.
Right, right.
- Now, no women!
No, no!
- Boo!
Come on now, Dutch, I want ya
to get out of here, all of you.
(chants of protest)
I got a man from NASA and he
knows what he's doing.
Gleason's a disaster area.
The same thing'll happen to this
town. We'll handle it ourselves.
Come on!
The town got hit by the monster.
The crowd's getting out of hand,
I can't control 'em.
They're hellbent on destroying
that beast.
Vance, did you ever see
the movie "Jaws?"
Well, it makes that shark look
like a goldfish.
I know, I know. But, try to keep
them there as long as you can.
We're setting up the lights
around here and the bomb's
on it's way. And try to keep
the spider there.
We can't do anything with the
spider. Bullets don't hurt it.
The only thing I've got to stop
it here with is a traffic light.
Sheriff, at least try.
This is the sheriff, get on the
emergency unit.
I'm down here all by myself.
Call the National Guard back,
tell them we need
some heavy equipment, guns,
ammo, anything.
And by one sign, you can know
that the end of the world is
near, Luke Chapter 21, Verse 10
and 11.
Nations shall rise up against
nations and kingdom
against kingdom.
And great earthquakes shall
be in diverse places and famines
and pestilences.
And fearful sights and great
signs shall there be from Heaven
The spider is retreating,
heading out of town.
We've got a lot of people
hurt here.
Clear the street, the spider's
gone, spider's gone.
Get out of here.
You know that, that big one
is like mother queen bee.
Yes, and she's activated all the
spiders in this whole area.
Yeah, you think the smaller ones
will grow to be giants?
Well, it could be, unless that
neutron gadget works.
I wish that chopper'd get here.
Here comes somebody now.
(police siren)
Now what?
Vance!
- Clyde.
That big one, I just saw it
up on the highway.
It's cuttin' through the woods
and it's headin' this direction.
There goes the chopper now.
Can you patch me through?
- Sure, Vance, this way.
Caine, this is Vance. Caine this
is Vance. Use your spotlight
as a target and drop the gadget.
Want me to land and give you
the trigger?
Hell, no! Now look, I'm gonna
fire a flare
and you pull the trigger.
- Okay.
Follow us, come on.
Jenny,
- Yes
I forgot the flares.
They're in the briefcase, would
you get 'em?
I'll get them.
We've got company.
We've gotta keep her outta that
black hole til we make the drop.
Okay, I'm gonna try.
- Good boy.
Ahhh! Ohhh! Oh!
Jenny, hurry with the flare gun,
they're coming back.
Ooh!
(gunshots)
Get back, you...
Believe it, it's as big
as a house.
Vance! Vance!
- What happened?
Spiders came out of the
briefcase. They're coming
from the geodes.
- The what?
Geodes!
- Gimme this, come on.
Get over there and take cover.
All right.
Hey, come on. Everyone of you
get out of there.
Hurry up, come on.
Get down!
(monster's dying screams)
Is it sealed? Is it sealed?
- Yeah, it's sealed.
Oh, God. This is...
can it happen again?
I don't know.
Oh!
- I don't know.
(preacher's voice off-screen)
When pharaoh refused the
children of Israel their right
to exist, the heavens opened
up and deluged the land
with flies, frogs,
lice and locusts.
It happened before
and it will happen again.
