People have been
struggling to recover
from a record-breaking
heat wave,
and it just keeps getting worse.
Now, it's floods.
Entire towns have
been reduced to ashes.
These fires are now
the most destructive...
Deforestation is
rapidly accelerating.
Oxygen levels
plummet from deforestation.
Extinction revelers
lost the war today.
...as the last tree on Earth
was logged in the Amazon.
Large areas of
ocean algae are dying.
Revolution over Europe
now so widespread...
Fatal respiratory
illness...
Is the biggest
killer in more
than 100 countries
across the globe.
Plant life extinct,
food rations oversubscribed...
And supplies are
stretched beyond...
What the local
charities can support.
Overpopulation in
Africa and the Middle East
now catastrophic.
Reports of oxygen
content dropping.
Synthetic oxygen supplies
buckle under demand
as the UN disbands.
Thousands suffocate in...
And now,
Canada has gone dark.
We've lost India.
After losing
Belgium...
Germany is offline.
China now completely dark.
In all of the
Middle East since January...
O2 supplies
dangerously low as...
As survivors flood
to the last...
...the last city
not in darkness.
Emergency reroute required.
90 seconds until
nuclear core overload.
You down the hall tonight?
Why? You going to grace us
with your presence?
Fill up both.
See if she'll hold.
Danger.
Evacuate utility tunnel.
Yeah. She'll hold.
And hell no, I'm not going.
Oh, come on, man.
There'll be booze
and small talk.
Not for all the oxygen
in the world.
Hey.
Hanging around a bunch
of lowlife foggers.
Lowlife foggers
have feelings too.
Alright. Light it up.
30 seconds until overload.
Evacuation incomplete.
Utility tunnel locking down.
Sealed.
Depressurization imminent.
You know, you might even
find yourself a wife there
one of these nights.
Another mouth to feed,
great plan.
How the hell am I going to
have time for a wife
when I'm stuck down here
wiping your ass every day?
- Right here.
- ...5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Light it up, baby.
Ah!
Power reroute complete.
System stabilized.
Workers, form an orderly line.
A reminder that oxygen credits
are not transferable.
ChroniCorp... Breathe easy.
Uh, I can't, uh,
do my shift tomorrow,
but it's not a problem.
Uh...
- I'll take it.
- I can make it up.
No. It's not my fault
you don't want to get paid.
- I'll take his shift.
- We're ahead, boss.
Fine. You're in. He's out.
Permanently.
What? No, no. Hey, hey.
- You good?
- Yeah, man.
It's more money in the pocket.
O2 is currently at 3.3%.
Come on. Let's go.
Where the hell is he?
Hey, man.
Georgie, I need the money
tomorrow.
He owes me money for that.
Hey, Jerry.
How you doing?
There's no fire without oxygen.
There's no fire without oxygen.
Yeah.
You got any smart ideas?
- Get out of here.
- There's no fire without oxygen.
- Get out of here.
- Hey.
- Why don't you just leave it?
- No. You listen to me.
- There's no fire without oxygen.
- It's always something.
...for generations to come.
Hey. No, listen.
We have to sacrifice it all
for the generations to...
Oxygen is not a privilege.
You're not listening,
and I will make you listen.
- Okay. Alright.
- I need my job.
- Get off me.
- My kids got the sickness too.
- I will make you listen.
- What do you want me to do?
- We all need to...
- Listen to me.
You know that oxygen
is not a privilege.
Another suicide protest today
marked the anniversary
of the death
of the last
living plant in captivity.
Since the believed extinction
of plant life,
deaths have continued
to spiral out of control
due to biophysical rejections
of the synthetic oxygen
that humanity
has come to rely on.
As the leading distributor
of synthetic O2,
ChroniCorp is still committed
to finding a solution
to this oxygen crisis that the
world has termed The Sickness.
However, citizens continue
to revolt amid fears
that this may be the end
for humankind.
ChroniCorp's quantum physicist
Dr. Richard Whyte
once radically posed that
in the unlikely event
that humanity
survives this crisis,
could we somehow find a solution
from our descendants
in the future?
Some suggest that his death
some 20 years ago
is linked to...
- Oh, my...
- Hi.
Hi.
Did I just hear your dad's name?
I got something for you.
Oh?
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.
- Are they closed?
- Yes.
- Alright. Keep them closed.
- Mm-hmm.
Keep them closed.
Okay. Okay.
Open.
What did you do this time?
See, um, the strap is loose
on the other one, and I...
I... I still have to seal it,
and, well,
this one is compatible
with the high-grade O2.
I don't need that.
Okay. It's fine.
I-I-I got a new shift.
But this is fashion.
It looks great.
Yeah, it does.
Really?
Oh. What?
Don't you want to look
pretty too?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Don't... Don't start this again.
Remember what they said.
- You need to calm down.
- Okay.
You need... you... you...
you need to relax.
Shit.
Are you okay?
- Sorry.
- J-Just give it to me.
It's fine.
- Please.
- It's fine.
Shit.
Citizen number 34465?
We've been instructed
to bring you upstairs.
We've got clearance
to be down here.
He doesn't like to be touched.
He'll go if I go.
Let's just see
what they've got to say.
Come on.
Greetings, citizen.
Welcome to the Applied Sciences
Division of ChroniCorp.
ChroniCorp is proud to be
the largest supplier
of breathable air
to the people of the world.
ChroniCorp... Breathe easy.
Greetings, citizen.
Welcome to the Applied Sciences
Division of ChroniCorp.
ChroniCorp is proud to be
the largest supplier
of breathable air
to the people of the world.
Even the fires
burn themselves out.
They can't breathe, either.
My name is Regina Jackson.
I'm the CTO of
Particle Research.
And you're Ethan Whyte.
Um, yes, ma'am.
How's your wife?
Our records show...
I'm looking after her.
We've all accepted
that things today
are even worse
than what scientists predicted.
The fact is
the O2 rejection epidemic
is going to wipe out the human
race within a handful of years.
I appreciate you bringing us
up here, but...
but what exactly
are you offering?
What if I told you that
you could save all of us?
I-I'd hate to seem like
I don't appreciate
this show-and-tell,
but I think we should go.
Your security
has been upgraded.
You'll be briefed at the lab.
Welcome to our Hail Mary.
Meet the Chronicle.
Billy Mitchell.
An absolute honor
to meet you, Ethan.
So you're the one.
Interesting.
Ethan, do you know
what your father did here?
Alright.
3 minutes, 10 seconds.
Calibration is within tolerance.
It's taken us 20 years.
If only your father
could see this.
My father's not here, is he?
Right. Of course. I'm sorry.
During our first trial,
we tested the Chronicle
with something that wouldn't
take as much power as matter...
radio waves to act
like a sort of ping
to see what was
on the other side.
The radio waves bounced back,
but they had been changed.
There was something
encoded inside.
Bounced back, what?
What do you mean, bounced back?
From where?
Not where, when.
We received a message
from the future.
From the future?
This is a fucking time machine?
407 years into the future.
400 years?
You're telling me people
are still alive then?
The message was simple, Ethan.
Red, decode
Chronicle file 170681.
Up here.
The people
who sent the message
must have found a cure
for the O2 sickness.
It's impossible.
There's no other way
they could still be alive
that far in the future.
We think they want to give
the cure to us
so that we could
save more people here.
Why ask for me?
We don't exactly know why,
but we may only get one shot
at sending someone.
One shot?
The Chronicle feeds off the
nuclear reactor under the city.
Just to fire a clock
a few minutes through time
knocks large sections
of the city off the grid.
To fire the mass
of a human that far?
Let's just say I hope we
don't have to try this twice.
Why do I get the feeling
that there's a catch?
Ethan, we don't know yet
how to bring you back.
You want to shoot me
into oblivion with...
with no way to get home?
You have to find
the people who sent the message.
They can help you get back.
You have got to find the cure.
You may be humanity's
only chance.
You may be your wife's
only chance.
Beautiful, crisp,
clean air, all you can breathe,
only $20 an hour.
Have you ever seen
anything like that shit before?
- Two more.
- It's all very impressive.
I'm not leaving Xanthe
as a favor to those ghouls.
Use it.
He's buying.
Ah. Alright. Alright.
What's the matter
with you?
What?
Do you... do you really believe
I'm going to save the world?
Very romantic.
You need to take this seriously.
Your old man believed them.
My old man was a fool
and a liar.
What if there's more
to his story, Ethan?
Story?
You want to hear more?
A father leaves a suicide note
for his 8-year-old son.
If he'd just been there instead
of chasing fucking rainbows,
my mother would
still be alive.
Very heroic,
and as if this wasn't enough
of a reminder of that,
you want me to do what?
Follow in his footsteps
to leave my sick wife to die?
I remember when I brought you
down in the tunnels
for the first time.
You were so scared
of just being left alone.
Remember what I told you?
"Without the darkness,
there's no light."
Stupid saying.
Fuck you.
Listen, shithead.
I've been through hell
and back in this life.
I've lost my family,
damn near lost my mind.
I've been working in
those fucking tunnels
for as long as I can remember,
and the only thing
I know that works
is when we fight for ourselves,
protect what's ours.
I can protect Xanthe.
I'm not just going
to abandon her.
And what are you going to do
when she gets worse?
This ain't about
saving the world, bro.
You want to prove
that you're not like him?
Save her.
He's been waiting for you
all day.
I made this for you,
Ethy,
because I have it
on good authority
that you are going to grow up
to be someone very important.
A science man?
A science man.
Now, this is going to hurt
a little,
but it will help you become
who you are meant to be.
Now, one day you'll understand.
You will want to trust what you
can see with your own eyes,
but it won't be enough, and you
will need to make a choice
about whether you believe
in something bigger.
Believe in what?
Believe in people.
I'm sorry, Ethy.
You're done.
It won't come off.
What's wrong with you?
Papa...
Don't you dare
leave us again.
When?
I'm not leaving you to chase
some stupid fantasy.
You think a second chance
is a fantasy?
How could you say that?
Fucking scientists.
Do you think your tool kit
is important right now?
My tools need to be clean.
Look at me.
I have responsibilities here.
I need to meet my shifts.
We're... We're so close
to having enough for
the high-grade O2.
That could help you.
It could slow down the symptoms.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
What?
You can say that you're afraid,
but don't you dare use me
as an excuse.
You're better than that, Ethan.
What?
What are you talking about?
You're everything to me.
I-I can look after you.
I can help you.
I-I can make more money.
I can make you okay.
Who's to say that time
is anything
we should mess with anyway?
What if I can't change anything?
Who's to say that we can't?
Okay. What if I could?
What if I mess with something,
and it makes everything worse?
I can't believe what I'm hearing
right now.
No. I'm not going to risk
losing you.
You can't lose me.
Of course I can.
You've got to have faith, Eth,
that you can be bigger.
Faith isn't going
to protect you.
Now is not the time to have
your tail between your legs.
We're a team.
Why aren't you on my side?
Last year, I had
20 kids in my class.
This year, I have 12.
I saw three of them suffocate
right in front of me.
You're the only one
I care about.
I wouldn't be with you
if I thought that was true.
I'm afraid too, Ethan.
I know that you'll come back
to me.
I believe in you.
Papa!
Fuck.
Papa...
Your father is not here.
I don't care if I can only find
one dose of this cure.
Xanthe gets the first one,
or I'm not going.
You need me.
Okay, Ethan.
We have a deal.
These aren't just
space suits, Ethan.
These are my babies.
Fenrir is not quite ready,
but, Tyr, she'll get you there.
She'll protect you.
The Chronicle, at this time,
can't tether to itself
in the future.
There's something wrong
at the other end.
What the hell does that mean?
It means we're going to
have to throw you there.
Throw me there?
Without being tethered
at the other end,
there's a chance you could land
inside a mountain
or the ocean, so...
You've got to be kidding me.
We have to aim a little higher.
We'll land you as close
as we can
to the source
of the radio waves.
You just find the people.
Track them down and bring
the cure back home to us.
Sounds easy.
This may be humankind's
most critical journey.
I'm counting on you to find
a way back, Ethan.
Okay.
One more time, focus.
Who's this?
- Archie.
- Yeah.
What does Archie do?
Um, systems analysis,
navigation, communication.
Yeah. That's right.
Archie is your only friend,
so treat her well.
The suit will feed your vitals
back to us from Archie,
so we're going
to know you're safe.
We'll be watching.
Hold your breath.
Look at me.
Do not let go.
Timing quantum forward.
Look after her.
Only till you get back.
See you soon, brother.
Go bring back the light.

Ethan.
Hello.
Come on.
Ethan Whyte. Come in!
Ethan Whyte to base. Come in!
- Archie?
- Hello, Ethan.
Archie, where are we?
Let me find a satellite.
Satellite link failed.
Location unknown.
Searching. Searching.
Satellite link failed.
Archie,
geography magnetics, go.
I have detected a structure.
It's not far.
Follow me.
Fuck.
Am I going to die here?
Fuck you.
Archie?
I'm here, Ethan.
Why are there two of me
here at once?
I don't think this is
a second you, Ethan.
I think this is you.
So I'm dead and alive
at the same time?
Even I have trouble
with time travel, Ethan.
Very helpful, thanks.
My pleasure.
Archie?
Yes, Ethan?
Status.
Nuclear cell at 2%,
display offline.
Replay last recording.
Am I going to die here?
Maybe it's better this way.
No one is suffering anymore.
What did you have to sacrifice?
I am your family.
you.
Ah, please!
Please!
No, no!
Power failure.
Shutting down. Goodbye.
No, no, no, no!
Archie! Archie!
Diagnose.
Signal found.
It's an emergency beacon.
We should make contact.
Follow me.
Hello?
Hello?
Rub the sticks together.
Friction makes fire.
Easy, peasy.
Rub. Rub.
Easy, peasy.
- Easy, peasy.
- Easy, peasy.
Easy, peasy.
Fire takes time, Ethan.
Come on.
Rub, rub, rub.
Even I have trouble with fire.
Come on!
Keep at it!
- Easy, peasy.
- Ugh!
Rub, rub, rub!
- Ugh!
- Good.
Now blow.
Blow, blow, blow, blow.
Fire!
Easy, peasy.
Unidentified.
Gee, thanks.
Ugh.
Scanning.
Scanning.
Star formations synchronized.
Date... 2474 AD.
Stars.
Stars.
Stars.
How are we like stars?
That's silly.
Okay.
Try this.
So you see, Ethy,
I will never
let anything happen to you.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Ah!
No, wait. Ethan, please.
You're not real!
You're not real!
You're not real!
Ethan, you're hallucinating.
What the... What the hell?
You poisoned yourself
because of the gallberries.
Jude?
You're going to be okay, kid,
as long as you do what I say.
Right away, we knew
something was wrong.
We could see your pulse
echoing back.
Then your blood-toxicity
level spiked.
Poison.
Your heart stopped.
You know, I watched you die,
Ethan.
I'm not dead.
Am I?
I don't think so.
But Billy said he had
just enough power
to fire the Chronicle
one last time.
I grabbed a second suit.
Couldn't leave you down here
all by your lonesome.
I told him I could
bring you back.
You came for me.
I hit the ground
like a ton of bricks.
Everything was destroyed...
my suit, everything.
I'm just happy to be alive, man,
happy to see your ugly mug,
happy to be breathing
without a fucking mask.
Xanthe?
Man, she needs you.
There's a problem.
What the hell is this?
I thought you saved me,
but I'm still dead.
No.
No. This isn't right.
I mean, this isn't you.
I thought you said
I was poisoned.
You were.
I mean, we changed that.
Didn't we?
Something is very wrong.
You think?
Listen, was there
anything else here?
Like... like what?
A gun?
I'd say whoever left that hole
in my head took off with it.
Listen, this fucking
bag of bones is not you.
Been eating berries again, huh?
Well, whoever sent for me,
for them to survive
this long to regrow this place,
they must have found a cure.
If I don't find them in time,
Xanthe's...
- Well, let's find them.
- Yeah.
We were sent here for a reason.
Now we follow the bread crumbs.
Emergency beacon
saturation 98%.
We're close.
Ready?
Let's see if anyone's home.
I got your back.
Hello?
Careful.
Hello?
Ethan!
Hey, stick with me, Jude.
I can't see shit.
Activate what?
Ah!
Shit!
Come out!
Access?
Not possible.
Hello, GRID One.
Hail Mary, brother.
Hello, relegating 1,270.
Ethan Whyte, DNA identity
confirmed.
Chronicle access granted.
Portal priming sequence
commencing.
Countdown commencing.
Four hours to
portal activation.
Destination 2067 AD.
Ethan.
Ethan, if this puppy
still works,
we can use it to get home.
Where are the people?
Doesn't look like anyone's home.
This doesn't make sense.
This is all wrong.
I'm just looking at
what's in front of me, man,
and I see a lifeboat.
I thought when you saved me
from the poison
that it changed
the course of everything.
Obviously, it changed nothing.
What does that mean?
It means there's something
bigger at play.
When this thing
scanned my blood,
the light, it's been
red my whole life.
It just changed to green.
This one, from the skeleton,
it was already green.
So what?
It means the dead me
has been through this before.
- The dead you?
- Every step I'm taking, he took.
Are you listening to yourself?
How is that possible?
It's like he's my future.
It's like I'm becoming him.
It's not possible!
You got to bring it down,
brother.
You're losing your mind, man.
- Grid?
- Yes, Ethan?
Does this thing give me access
to the Chronicle's data backup?
Yes, Ethan.
Decode the system logs.
Chronicle log number one...
We are at the beginning
of a journey
that could change everything.
My name is
Professor Richard Whyte,
and I'm the lead physicist
of the Chronicle Project.
We have discovered an anomaly
in the Higgs field,
which might soon allow us
to send radio waves
and eventually matter
through time.
Stop!
What makes you think
you're going to find
what you're looking for?
I have to.
No, you don't.
We have buried an atmospheric
monitoring station.
It will continue to operate,
and if it reaches a time
in the future
when the air is breathable,
it will send this data back
to us through the Chronicle.
Our hope is that the Chronicle
will help us learn
from our descendants how they
replenished the O2 levels.
Enough.
This is going to hurt
more than it helps.
I can't run from him forever.
Please.
Log 97.
Bring your A game, people.
Prep the countdown.
Our entire lives have led
to this moment.
We are preparing
subject number one,
the radio-wave packet
that will ping
the Chronicle in the future.
If it works,
we should get an echo
with data on the O2 levels.
Firing ping in 3, 2, 1.
Echo received.
Ping returned.
Date... 2474 AD.
It works!
Ping data decoded.
Data has been manually
overridden at destination.
English words encoded
in transmission.
English? What?
Jesus.
What in God's name?
I didn't do this.
How is this possible?
You need to make this work.
It is working.
Someone is calling for my son.
How the fuck do they know
about your son?
I can't explain this.
Don't tell me that.
We all have families.
It is working.
Someone sent us this message.
There is someone
at the other end.
So we move to the next phase.
How long before we can test
sending matter?
We can't.
Speak.
There's a problem with the power
at 2474.
Warning, nuclear core
power failure.
Warning,
Chronicle systems offline.
Archie, diagnose.
Nuclear core,
cold-fusion power feed corrupt.
What does that mean?
The portal will not
tether to 2067, Ethan.
There is not enough power.
Archie, where is the failure?
Searching.
Searching.
Nuclear core control room,
access via service tunnel
section seven.
- Grid?
- Yes, Jude Mathers?
Why hasn't
the countdown stopped?
Jude Mathers,
the Chronicle priming sequence
has commenced
and cannot be stopped.
The system would reach
unstable particle levels.
Define unstable.
If the power feed
is not reconnected
before the countdown
reaches zero,
the charged particles
in the Chronicle
will create a nuclear explosion.
Nuclear explosion
doesn't sound good.
Let's not die today, Eth.
Wait.
If they received this message
all that time ago,
they knew about
the power failure.
Grid, if we fix
the Chronicle's power,
how long will portal stay open
before the nuclear core drains?
Once the countdown
reaches zero,
the portal will tether to 2067
for approximately 30 seconds.
Eth, it's going to take us
hours to get down to the core.
We got to gun it there now.
Jesus Christ.
Did you not see what I just saw?
Someone sent that message
from here!
That... That means
they fixed this place.
That means they have a cure!
They can help me fix Xanthe.
Yeah, whoever sent the message,
they're not here.
Why didn't they tell us
about the power failure?
Why did they send you?
What?
I came to save you,
stab antitoxin
in your dead body.
But why not send a soldier or...
or a medic?
Well, who else is going to
damn near kill themselves
to save your thankless ass?
Listen, man.
You were right.
We can't save everyone,
but I can save you.
- Let's go.
- No. No.
I was wrong.
I need to figure this out.
We've got one shot at fixing
this thing.
One shot, Ethan.
I can't do it without you,
brother, so let's take control.
We've got to take control,
little brother.
I need... I need more time.
So don't you want to see
Xanthe again?
Don't use her like that.
I'm not going to let you
get yourself killed.
Get off me.
Please, wake up, kid.
I mean, I have never
let you down,
so don't let me down now.
3 hours, 50 minutes
to nuclear explosion.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, whoever sent the message,
they're not here.
Now we just need to make our
way down to the access tunnel.
We need to turn the power on,
and then we'll have enough
time to find them.
3 hours, 50 minutes,
tick tock.
The city should be right here.
They never found a way
to survive.
The Earth just waited
for us to die.
Eth,
where have you taken us?
'Cause this ain't the way.
They just died
here in the classroom,
just sitting here.
Everything just got worse.
They didn't even
remove the dead.
Does this mean that we failed?
Eth.
Eth.
Eth, don't.
Ethan.
Xanthe.
It's okay, buddy.
Don't you dare leave again.
Richard, where are you?
What have you done to him?
No. What? No.
I don't... I...
No. I don't understand.
You're going to have to tell him
yourself.
Ethy...
Ethy, listen to me.
I need you to go for
a little walk with your mom.
- Papa, I want to stay here.
- I will meet you.
I promise.
Do you understand?
You have to trust me now.
Okay.
You have to climb up there,
baby.
Quick. Climb, baby.
Just go.
Just go, baby.
- Mom!
- Climb.
Just climb, please, climb.
- Mom!
- Ethan.
We don't have any money.
Please. He's just a boy.
Please. No!
No!
No!
Mama.
No.
Mama, no.
Mama.
I'm with you.
No!
Mama!
Papa.
Papa.
Papa.
Papa.
Papa.
Breathe.
Come on, breathe.
You've got to fight
for yourself now.
Your father's not here.
Breathe.
Breathe.
- No!
- Breathe.
- No! No!
- Breathe.
Breathe.
Breathe.
There, you go.
- Jesus.
- I have to get back to her.
I have to.
I know.
How could I leave her alone?
Well, you did what you thought
was right, Eth.
Did I?
I promised her I'd come back.
We're in control of our fate,
right?
Just got to have fucking faith.
Just got to have faith.
I-I can't lose her again.
This is not your fault.
I left her to die.
Hey.
You're not him, Eth.
What if we can't
change anything?
Maybe it's not our place.
That can't be true.
There... There has to be a way.
It's dust and... dust and bones.
It can't be the only way.
It can't.
- We...
- No more detours.
Maybe it's better this way.
No one's suffering anymore.
Come on.
What did you just say?
What?
What?
Archie...
Archie, repeat last playback.
Who is that?
Maybe it's better this way.
No one is suffering anymore.
Data corrupt.
Skipping ahead.
What did you
have to sacrifice?
I did this for you.
You did this
for yourself.
This is our fate, Ethan.
- There is no other way.
- Wait.
What did you say?
No, no, no!
- No!
- Fight me!
I'm so sorry.
No, no.
Power failure.
Shut down.
What are you...
What are you doing?
Why the fuck is my voice
in that thing?
You tell me.
Why did you hide that from me?
Why did you hide that from me?
And why do you have a gun?
It's protection.
From what?
You said it yourself.
This place, it...
it's dust and bones.
Protection from what, me?
Are you going to shoot me,
brother?
What?
You're losing your mind.
That's not me on that thing.
Jude, Jude, give me the gun.
I'm in control.
- Please.
- Why did you trick me?
Please, please, please,
please, Jude.
- Give me the gun.
- Stay right there.
- Just... Just...
- Stay right there.
Just give me the gun, Jude.
Please.
You know how my skeleton
got there, don't you?
Warning... two hours
to nuclear explosion.
- Please, please, please, please.
- Move.
You want to tell me
what you're doing?
Saving you from yourself. Move.
Looks like we found our problem.
Emergency reroute
required.
It's so fried.
We've got to reroute the power.
Archie, reroute stability.
Reroute stability 30%,
Ethan.
Okay. Hit it.
Come on.
Power reroute failure.
Damn it.
Give us a fucking chance.
Evacuate service chamber.
Eth, look out! The door.
Depressurization required.
Grid, override.
Unable to comply.
It won't work.
We need to manually pull
the backup breaker
while the room
is depressurized.
Am I going to die in here?
Purging O2.
You aren't.
Ethan!
Ethan!
No!
Stars?
How are we like stars?
Power restored.
Nuclear core active.
Grid, system status.
Chronicle systems online.
Critical systems nominal.
37 minutes to portal launch.
Thank fucking Christ.
Where does this go?
No.
No. No.
- What?
- How didn't I-I see it?
See what?
The... The...
The... The future. It's...
It's already written.
We're just turning
the fucking pages.
Give that to me.
No.
Ethan, stop playing games.
I-I am going to die.
What happens next, Jude?
I-I thought that
when we changed my death,
it meant that I could
change fate...
mine, Xanthe's, everyone's.
But the skeleton, it...
it's still there.
My skeleton is still here.
Why are we still talking about
a fucking skeleton?
My skeleton is still here
because
we can't change anything.
Everything was always
going to play out this way.
No matter what we do,
it's leading us to that moment.
You're confusing yourself,
Ethan.
No.
We're going to go home,
and you're going to shoot me
in the head,
and I'm going to rot
in that hallway for 400 years.
Am I not useful to you anymore,
brother?
You wouldn't lie to me.
Why would I? Why would I?
Because you know I'm never
going to see her again.
I'm protecting you.
By putting a fucking gun
to my head?
- Archie...
- Put that fucking thing away.
- Yes, Ethan?
- ...play last recording.
Please, no. No.
No.
Find me!
No.
- I wouldn't.
- No!
Fuck.
The second I got here, it was...
it was staring me in the face.
I-I just didn't want
to believe it was you.
- It's not me, Ethan.
- Why?
Why wait until we get back
to do it?
Why not just fucking do it now?
How could you do that to me?
It's not the plan.
What plan?
- We've got to get out of here.
- What fucking plan?
If we leave now,
we can change everything.
Get off. Fuck!
- What fucking plan?
- You've got to trust me.
I'm protecting you,
God damn it.
Fuck!
Fuck.
30 minutes
to portal launch.
I'm in control.
I'm in control.
This place is alive, Ethan.
There's no reason
we can't live here.
And leave everyone to die?
Ethan.
There's no masks.
You can't stop them.
I saved you, Ethan,
but we can't save everyone.
You've lost your fucking mind.
Stay away from me.
Ethan!
My birthday.
I've made a terrible mistake.
We can't play God.
We don't belong
in God's playground.
Jude, what the fuck?
You're not going to find
what you're looking for.
Ethan, no!
Ethan!
There is no other way.
Ethan!
We don't belong
in God's playground.
We don't belong
in God's playground.
We don't belong
in God's playground.
It won't change anything.
Maybe one day
I'll be there, and I can say...
say this to your face.
All of this was for you, Ethan.
If I could give you the life
I never had,
then you'd know
that I love you.
Wouldn't you?
It's the hardest thing,
to admit what you're afraid of.
I never had a father.
I don't know if you know that.
Why do I run away?
I should have been there
for you.
I should have been there
for you.
I didn't know how.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Fuck.
Grid, dial home.
Richard, where are you?
What have you done to him?
Sweetheart, I don't have time
to explain.
I need you to take Ethan
and leave the house.
Meet me where we first met.
No. What? No.
I don't understand.
You're going to have
to tell him yourself.
Ethy.
Ethy, I need you to go
for a little walk with your mom.
Papa,
I want to stay here.
I will meet you.
I promise.
You have to trust me now.
Entry granted.
End call.
Jude.
I can't let you do it.
What are you thinking
now, Richard?
This isn't about
finding a cure anymore, is it?
You want to escape,
just leave the world behind.
There is no cure.
That message was sent
by someone.
There must be a cure.
We have a responsibility.
It's too late for that.
This world is done, Richard.
You want to save them all?
Most of them would
cut your throat
for one breath of fresh air.
They wouldn't know what to do
with another chance.
You're wrong.
Even if we could save them,
humans are a virus.
The Earth will heal but never
while we're suffocating it.
- This isn't the way.
- This is the only way.
The Earth needs time
without us, so we jump ahead.
Start again, or humanity
dies for nothing.
Who, your chosen few?
I know you've lost people,
but you can't...
This isn't about me, Richard.
You're right.
People are going to have to die.
It's not an easy decision,
but it's the right one.
It's not what we want.
It's what we need.
You need to have faith.
You're the scientist here.
You want to talk about faith?
I am not risking the survival
of humanity on your faith.
Hey, Richard.
Just wanted to say
thank you so much
for giving me this chance.
I've run the numbers,
and I'm sure it will work.
I've got the design team working
on a rough outline as we speak.
An outline for what?
What?
Wait.
Did Richard not authorize this?
Is it going to work or not?
I think so.
Yes, I mean,
it will take some time,
but I think we can eventually
jerry rig the Chronicle
to fire a person one way,
kind of like a...
a slingshot or a...
or a catapult.
That's suicide.
You're going to kill someone.
With some kind of protective
suit, they might have a chance.
All we need is one person
to fix the power
on the Chronicle
in the future, right?
We fix the power,
she opens up the portal,
and we can go safely through.
The ping came back.
There's oxygen there.
It proves the plan
has already worked.
Earth regrows only because
mankind doesn't make it.
No!
I don't believe
it's the only way.
I've locked the system
so only Ethan's DNA
can activate the Chronicle
at the other end.
Somebody sent for him,
and whether you believe or not,
you need him if you want
to open the portal.
Can you do it?
Can you get one person through?
I mean, I think it might
be possible,
but it's Richard's science,
so...
Can you make it work?
- Can you make it work?
- Yes!
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Stop!
Stop!
Damn it, stop! Stop.
Ms. Jackson, I-I don't...
I don't...
Go down with a team.
Make sure the boy stays alive.
You will be his guardian.
Let nothing happen to him.
You understand?
He's the key to everything now.
I know.
30 minutes
to portal launch.
Fuck you.
You fucking liar!
All this time, you used me!
You used me.
They used us.
I was just a kid, man.
They're still coming, Ethan,
even if you try and stop them,
and the world you care
so much about,
they died for nothing.
That can't be true.
We can't change the past.
Even if we could,
what would happen to this place?
What would happen to us?
I don't know!
But we can't leave
millions of people to die!
They have already died!
It's already happened, man!
There is no cure!
Eth, you said it yourself.
Things can't be changed,
little brother.
I'm not your brother.
You sound like your father now.
You know, if he had listened
to Jackson, he'd still be here.
Only the strong survive, Ethan.
So you bought yourself a place
in the new world.
What did you have to sacrifice?
Me?
Xanthe?
I am your family.
I did this for you.
You did this for yourself.
There has to be another way.
I have to stop this thing.
- No, I can't let you.
- I have to stop this thing.
There is no other way.
This is our fate.
There is no other way.
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no!
- I'm sorry.
No, no!
Fight me.
Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.
Fight me.
- Fight me.
- Please!
- No! No!
- Fight me!
No!
No, no!
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
- Fight me! Fight me!
- Please, no, no, no!
Fight me!
No! Help me!
You got to fight
for yourself now.
Fight me!
Help.
Please.
You got to fight me.
I believe in you.
I believe in you.
It is me.
I can change.
I'm so sorry.
Ohh, geez.
Distinguished friends,
you have stood with me
while you watched your world
fall down around you.
This is our time.
Each one of you
has played a part
in bringing us to this point.
History will not forget you.
This day will be marked
as the day that we proved
that we will not go quietly
into the night,
the day the human race
took control of its fate.
I have it on good authority
that you are going to grow up
to be someone very important.
This is going to hurt,
but it will help you become
who you are meant to be.
One day you'll understand it.
You will want to trust what you
can see with your own eyes,
but it won't be enough,
and you'll need to make a choice
about whether you believe
in something bigger.
- Archie?
- Yes, Ethan?
Someone is here.
Who is here, Ethan?
I'm here.
I believe.
Believe in...
believe in what?
Believe in people.
- No!
- Fight me!
I'm sorry.
Incoming particle stream.
Ethan.
He's a liability.
Shoot him.
Leave him here.
Once we're gone,
it won't matter.
Remember the drill.
We have one shot.
Once the portal opens, we have
30 seconds to clear through.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
Tether interrupted.
Shutting down.
No.
No.
No. No.
No.
No!
ChroniCorp's headquarters
were raided just moments ago
after this news station
received an anonymous broadcast.
Officials seized hundreds
of believed-extinct plants.
If what we are hearing is true,
this may be the second chance
the world so desperately needs
for ecological regeneration.
Religious groups are already
calling it the deus ex machina,
or God out of the machine.
Entry request.
Entry request.
Security override.
Xanthe Whyte?
Stars?
How are we like stars?
Silly.
Okay. Here.
Here, try this.
What's between us?
Your hands.
No.
Here.
Imagine for a moment that we are
all physically connected
by the very fabric
of the universe.
An invisible field
that bonds us together,
everything in the universe.
It's you, me, the stars.
We are all connected
through time.
So you see, Ethy,
even when I'm not with you,
we are always together.
