Who had informed the police?
He is right here.
- Bring him in.
And you are? - I am
Mr. Ouseppachan's son-in-law.
What is your name?
- Johny. - Please come.
This is Mr. Ouseppachan.
He is Omana's father-in-law.
This is Sunny,
her husband.
This is Mr. Narayanan.
A social worker.
Where is the way to the terrace?
- It's right inside, sir.
This way.
Shall I hold the inquest, sir?
- Okay.
My dear! - Sister! - My dear
daughter! - Please, don't touch.
What is this?
Please get up.
Don't touch the body.
Move aside.
Yes, please move.
- My dear daughter.
Oh, dear Lord!
My dear!
Who are they?
Sir, they are
Omana's father and sister. - Okay.
Show them the body.
Omana!
- Oh, God!
My dear daughter!
- Father!
Father!
- My dear.
Oh, God!
Sister!
Cover it.
You may take the dead body.
- Okay. Let's go.
'I am the RMO from
General Hospital, Trivandrum.'
'I hereby declare that on
the 30th of September 1987'
'the post-mortem of 25-year-old
Omana was performed under the case'
'of crime number 25/86 from
Kumarapuram village police office.'
'As per the results, injuries were
found only on the head and neck.'
'Injury on the head from
fall is the cause of death.'
'The autopsy was performed on the
body after 15 hours of her death.'
'During the examination, there
were no signs of manhandling.'
'The post-mortem certificate
will be delivered.'
Mr. Thomachan.
It's been many days.
But you're still..
The DYSP is inside.
Sunny, please eat something.
Please come.
I don't want anything.
- Sunny.
We need you downstairs.
Take a seat.
Don't you wear a watch, Sunny?
- No.
How long have you been married?
- Four years.
Were the two of you happy during
the initial years? - Yes.
Are you saying that
you had no conflicts? - No.
No arguments at all?
Sometimes.
- When?
We used to have
petty arguments.
Did it happen on the day she died?
Yes.
- Why? What was the reason?
I have the habit
of drinking alcohol.
She was against my drinking.
I hope you remember what
happened that day.
Tell us.
Where are you going?
- Why do you want to know?
Aren't you going to drink?
- Yes.
The doctor had advised
you to not drink.
He will say a lot of things.
Move! - If you want,
you can sit and drink here.
I will decide that.
Move aside.
No, I won't allow you to leave.
Who are you to decide that?
Move aside!
When she didn't allow you to leave,
you used force..
No, sir.
Nothing of that sort had happened.
Haven't you ever
hurt her physically?
No, sir. I have never
tried to hurt her by any means.
I find it difficult to believe you.
Do you believe that
it's a case of suicide?
I cannot think of any other reason.
Do you suspect anyone?
- No, sir.
Did she ever tell you anything
about committing suicide?
Tell me. - She had once tried
to commit suicide.
We were able to save her as we
took her to the hospital on time.
When did that happen?
Five months ago.
When I returned from work
she was unconscious after
consuming sleeping pills.
I was able to save her
because I reached on time.
Didn't you ask her the reason
for taking such a drastic step?
I asked her many times.
She never gave a reasonable reply.
What do you mean? - She would
try to change the topic.
Interesting.
You don't know the reason why your
wife tried to kill herself, is it?
You didn't try to find the reason,
is it?
Tell me!
- She couldn't conceive a child.
She was depressed about it.
Who told you?
- Dr. Mohandas, a psychiatrist.
Will a psychiatrist decide
if she could conceive or not?
It was a gynecologist
who told us about it.
Was she mentally ill?
She used to get badly
depressed at times.
She never used to talk to anyone.
So, we consulted Dr. Mohandas.
What did he tell you?
He said that she was
depressed about not conceiving
and that she would feel better
after the treatment.
Did you inform the police about
her suicide attempt? - No, sir.
A suicide attempt is a punishable
offense.
Trying to hide it is also
a punishable offence.
Are you aware of it?
- Yes.
Then why didn't you
inform the police?
I was worried about
the humiliation.
Is it? So, you're worried
about getting humiliated.
Is there a humiliating reason
behind her death as well?
I meant, anything which
couldn't be made public. - No, sir.
When did you go out that day?
Around 8 p.m.
- You never wear a watch.
Then how can you
say it so precisely?
Well, everyday at that time..
- At that time?
At that time..
- Tell me.
At that time, the siren at
Kamala Tile Factory used to ring.
You were about to say
something else. - No, sir.
No! - I swear.
No.
You can leave.
Sir, if we threaten him a bit more.
He will spill all the truth. - No.
He is only going to lie
to all our questions.
He is prepared for that.
- Yes, sir.
Call Ouseppachan.
Ouseppachan, please come inside.
At what time did you
reach home that day?
Around 10 to 10:30 at night.
- Is it 10 or 10:30?
I don't remember the exact time.
Mr. Ouseppachan,
where did you go that day?
Ernakulam.
- Why?
For a business purpose.
- Who accompanied you?
My manager, Mr. Mathayi
and our driver, Vasu.
Was your manager with
you when you returned home?
No, I dropped him off at his house.
You saw the dead body first, right?
- Yes.
Can you explain how?
Sir, can I leave? - Okay, come
early in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Sunny.
Omana.
Idiot!
How can he sleep like this?
Sunny!
Sunny!
Sunny!
They won't even know if a
burglar breaks into the house.
Omana!
Sunny!
Sunny!
Omana!
Omana!
Why did you go to the backyard?
To call the servant.
She used to sleep in that house.
- Why?
Didn't she hear you shouting
for Sunny and Omana?
She cannot hear properly.
- Is she deaf?
She can hear only
if we speak too loudly.
So, is she the only servant
you have in this house?
I have a manager.
Also, there is another servant
who works in the daytime.
Where is that manager?
Does he stay here?
No, he stays at his house.
Where is it?
- It's nearby.
At what time did he leave
for home that day?
I had told you earlier that he was
with me when we went to Ernakulam.
I had dropped him home
on our way back.
Do you drink alcohol?
- Yes.
You were completely drunk
on that day, isn't it? - No.
Was your driver with you when
you first saw the dead body?
No, he left immediately
after giving me the key.
Isn't Vasu your henchman?
No, he is not a hooligan.
There are a lot of cases registered
against him for hooliganism.
I am not aware of it.
Is he a well-built person?
- Yes.
So, is he capable of throwing
someone from the terrace?
I don't know, sir.
What did you do after
seeing the dead body?
I called the servant.
Did she hear you? - No, I had
to keep calling her. She is deaf.
She opened the door for you
and you went inside the house.
What happened then?
- I was looking for Sunny.
I tried calling Johny
because I couldn't find Sunny.
How did you know that
Sunny was with Johny?
Johny is my son-in-law.
Sunny would never go anywhere else.
You can leave.
Give me a cigarette.
Why are you shivering?
Don't worry.
What is your name?
- What?
What is your name?
What is your name?
Name? I have been given the same
name as the mother of the Lord.
Mary.
How long have you been here?
- Age?
I was told that I was born
during the floods of '99.
Isn't it, sir?
How long have you been..
No, Alex.
Were Sunny and Omana in
good terms with each other?
Were Sunny and Omana in
good terms with each other?
I can hear you.
Stop shouting.
I am not deaf.
Then tell us.
Were Sunny and Omana in
good terms with each other?
Omana was such a good human being.
She used to treat me
like her own mother.
I don't know what
made her take this drastic step.
To commit suicide by
jumping from the building.
I couldn't eat anything
the whole day after
I heard about her death.
She used to pay me
every month an extra
Rs. 25 apart from the
salary given to me.
Who will pay me that extra
amount from now?
Go inside.
Chacko, tell everyone else to meet
me at the guest house. - Yes, sir.
Mr. Alex, have a seat.
- Sir.
I told them exactly
what you said I should say.
Okay,
you can go.
Alex, I will see you in the office.
- Sir.
I came to know that Mr. Varma
is a good man.
He has solved many famous cases.
You don't know.
Ouseppachan has money, influence
and supporters.
He can bribe anyone
with his money.
But what can we do?
We should directly hand over
our petition to Mr. Varma.
And the copies should be sent
to the IG and the Home Minister.
We can also send a copy to the news
reporters.
Let it get published
in the newspaper as well.
It has already been published.
It was also there in today's
newspaper.
Thomachan, let us meet Mr. Varma
and submit the petition tomorrow.
Call him.
Is anyone there?
Hey, open the door.
- I will not. Open it yourself.
Just go! Tell them that I am
not feeling well.
Such a trouble!
- Go!
Where is Sreedharan?
- He is inside.
DySP Varma is in his guest house.
He has asked Sreedharan
to go there.
He is not feeling well.
DySP has called him!
Just drag him out!
What is it? - You have been
asked to accompany them.
It seems the DySP is waiting
in his guest house.
Didn't I tell you?
- Wait a minute.
Don't open your mouth
unnecessarily.
If they ask something,
just don't answer to the point.
We are their tenants.
Don't say things that might
put us in trouble.
Okay?
- Yeah, right!
So, according to you, Omana's death
was suicide, right?
I believe so, sir.
Then you must have a reason
as well.
After knowing that she could not
conceive
Omana was a bit hysteric.
Whenever she came to my house
she used to cry at the sight
of my grandchildren.
That depression would have
led to her suicide.
Okay. You can leave, Narayanan.
Call Mathai inside.
- Yes, sir.
What happened, sir?
Who is Mathai?
- It's me. - Come inside.
What is your name?
- Mathai.
How long have you been
with Ouseppachan?
It's been around seven years.
What were you doing before that?
- I was into farming.
Tell me the truth.
What happened that night?
I don't know anything, sir.
Boss had dropped me at my house
that night.
I got to know about
Ms. Omana's death the next morning.
What was the time when you were
dropped at your house?
Around 9.30 p.m.
Approximately how far is your house
from that of your boss?
About ten minutes.. - By walk?
- Yes.
Then it would take lesser time
by car. - Yes.
But according to Ouseppachan,
he reached home at 10 p.m.
If he said so,
it must be right.
Maybe it was around 10 p.m.
when he dropped me at home.
What exactly do you know?
Please spare me, sir.
I am a heart patient.
You are not supposed to leave
this place. - Okay.
You should be here whenever
summoned. - Sure, sir.
You can leave.
- Okay.
Call Sreedharan.
- Yes, sir. - Okay.
Sreedharan! Come on.
- Go in.
Where do you work?
- In the brick factory.
You are Ouseppachan's neighbour,
right? - Yes.
On that day, did you hear some
unusual noise
or sound from their house?
I did not hear anything unusual.
But I heard a loud thud at around
10.30 p.m.
Didn't you go and check it out?
I thought it was a coconut.
But I realised things only
the next morning.
How is Sunny as a person?
- He is a good man.
But only till he gets drunk.
I have even heard him
shout at his wife
after getting drunk.
Have you seen him beating her?
How is that possible, sir?
From my house, I cannot see
what happens there.
But I have heard her shouting
and crying.
How is Ouseppachan as a person?
He is a selfish business man.
He earned so much money in
a short span of time.
People say that he acquired
Mr. Thomachan's
illegally by cheating him.
Are you not saying these out
of jealousy?
Definitely not.
What about his behaviour?
Does he have any bad habits?
It has been 15 years since
his wife passed away.
But he still leads a happy life.
Ouseppachan has got many
secret affairs here.
Anyway, what about Johny?
Are you talking about Ouseppachan's
son-in-law?
As far as I know,
he is a gentleman.
He is the one who handles
the business of Ouseppachan.
Is what you said true?
- Yes, sir.
But none should know that I have
told you all these.
My wife had warned me not
to open my mouth.
But I could not lie to you.
Stop there!
We need to meet Mr. Varma.
He is busy.
- We need to speak to him.
I can't allow you inside.
You need to have permission.
But we need to go inside.
- Stop there!
Babu! - Yes, sir?
- Send them inside. - You can go.
What is the matter?
- Sir, this is a petition.
I am the president of the Farmers'
Union. They are.. - I know them.
Sir, my daughter did not commit
suicide. She was murdered.
The petition says it all.
We need justice, sir.
- I will do the needful.
We have just started our
investigation.
I will be coming to take your
statements.
Then you can tell me everything.
Okay, sir. Shall we leave?
- Okay.
Hey! How could you kill my
daughter? - Dad!
Thomachan! - I will kill you!
- Hey!
Leave him..
- I will kill you!
Hey! - You!
- Dad!
I will kill you.. - Come.
- Stop.. - Scoundrel!
The statements and evidence
I have got till now force me
to conclude that Omana's
death was suicide.
Except for Sreedharan's
statement.
But we can't go to a conclusion
with that alone.
Because there was a bit
of exaggeration.
He might change his statement
any moment.
Even my conclusion is the same.
Especially since she'd attempted
suicide before.
And the post-mortem report
also supports the claim.
That is right.
But I am not able to completely
believe these evidence
and statements before me.
But it is of no use.
I will need at least a clue
to proceed with this as a murder
investigation.
The only people left to be
interrogated are Thomachan
Annie and some country folk.
I hope I get something positive
from them. - Don't hope so, sir.
We left out a person, sir.
Mr. Vasu, the driver.
He would be of no use to us.
I have got some doubts, sir.
- What is it? Tell me.
According to the doctor's
statement
the death had occurred 15 hours
before they found her. - Go on.
The post-mortem was done
at 11 a.m.
So, the death would have occurred
on the previous night
around 8 p.m.
That night, it was raining heavily
till 9:30 p.m.
I was on duty at that time.
It was almost 9:30 p.m.
when the rain had stopped
and that was when I went out
to have dinner.
If Omana had committed suicide
at 8 p.m.
the dead body and her clothes
must have been
damp with rainwater and mud.
Moreover, the blood would have
been washed down in the rain water.
My opinion is that Omana's death
was not suicide.
What if the doctor was at fault?
There could be a difference
of one or two hours.
Anyway, we will wait
for the forensic report.
Isn't it, sir? - Yes.
I agree with you.
I shall take a leave.
It is already late. - Okay.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
You have got a good point.
When Alex mentioned about
the doctor
I just agreed with him
for no reason.
I felt like Alex wants this death
to be proved as suicide.
Don't you think so?
- I am not sure, sir.
How is Thomachan related to you?
- He is my uncle, sir.
But that was not the reason behind
my doubts.
I understand.
We need to search for Vasu
tomorrow.
He may be very useful to us.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, I have kept the file
in your room.
Shall I leave?
- Sure, Chacko. Okay.
Whatever might be the evidence
he didn't believe that it's a
suicide from the start.
His doubts are stronger now.
- Damn!
That doctor betrayed us.
What is the use of complaining
now?
By the way, didn't you bribe
that doctor? - Of course.
He is a close friend of Johny.
But our friendship didn't reflect
on the bribe.
Still that bastard cheated me!
By the way, how is Mr. Varma?
Will he fall into our trap?
Keep waiting!
Have you gone crazy?
SP Prabhakara Varma is an officer
who will never compromise
with his duties
no matter who approaches him.
He does not even care about
being dismissed.
Mr. Narayanan, let me make
it clear to you.
Mr. Varma will try his level best
to prove this case.
You will be trapped for sure.
If you are destined to spend
your life in prison
then it is bound to happen.
Hey, why are you trying
to scare me?
I am not scaring anyone.
I am just stating the facts.
Such a nuisance! Do you have
any solution for this?
Mr. Varma should not investigate
this case.
We have to keep him away
from further investigation.
How is that possible?
You need to influence higher
officials and get it done!
There is no use in carrying the
cash in a money purse or a handbag.
Tell Ouseppachan
to carry it in a sack.
Well, how will I tell him?
Come with me.
- I won't come.
I made a suggestion based
on our acquaintance.
I am leaving.
One more thing.
While meeting the hot shots
please don't neglect me.
I am not from a wealthy family.
I have children who're in schools
and colleges.
Who knows if the IG and the
Minister are in Trivandrum?
Don't you have a phone?
Call them.
I am leaving.
Annie!
Dear!
Annie!
- What is it, Dad?
Please read this, dear.
Here.
'A new twist in the Omana case.'
'As many mysteries are
associated with the case'
'DySP Prabhakara Varma'
'who was heading the investigation'
'has been replaced by
the new DySP, Mr. Devadas.'
Jesus!
This is not fair.
What will we do now, dear?
We shall meet Mr. Chacko.
Yes. You are right.
I got the order yesterday.
Transfer to the Traffic Department.
Mr. Varma got transferred
to the Rural Department.
Why did they do so
without prior notice?
We might not have a reason.
Who is the new officer?
I heard that it was DySP,
Mr. Devadas.
What is his nature?
They will be benefitted.
- Who?
The ones who fear that the truth
in this case will be exposed.
Can no one oppose this?
The ones who are responsible
for opposing this
have signed this order.
What can we do?
What is the solution to this now?
There is only one
solution for this.
We need to obtain maximum
public support for this case.
Through newspapers and other media
this case must be made sensational.
How can we do this
in such short notice?
Okay.
We can do it slowly.
Let the new officer
start the investigation.
Dad.
The police are coming.
Mr. John Thomas?
- It is me, sir.
Who is Ms. Annie?
- I am Annie.
Okay.
Why do you feel that your daughter
didn't commit suicide, Mr. Thomas?
My daughter will never
commit suicide, sir.
So do you believe
that she was murdered?
Yes.
Who do you suspect, Mr. Thomas?
Is it Mr. Sunny,
Or Mr. Ouseppachan
or both of them?
I don't know, sir.
Was there any issue based on dowry?
Did you deny the dowry you promised
did Sunny create
a scene for that
and assault Omana for that?
That is my question.
No, sir.
Does Mr. Ouseppachan have any
personal vendetta against you?
Yes.
Come.
What is the reason?
I helped Mr. Ouseppachan
when he needed help.
When I needed help in return,
I went to him.
He did not like that.
That does not mean that
he has a personal vendetta.
But the relationship between
us became sour from that point.
He did not let me visit
my daughter after that.
We did not even receive
a letter from her.
When did this happen?
It has been a few months.
Is it?
If he did have a grudge against you
he could have sent Omana back.
Else he could have settled
scores with you directly.
But what is the use
in killing Omana?
Why are you adamant to close
this as a suicide case?
When I question Mr. Thomas,
he should answer.
You may talk when I talk to you.
Got it?
Didn't Omana try to commit
suicide before?
Or did someone try to poison her?
Omana can't have children,
isn't it?
Yes.
Was she sad about that?
Of course, sir.
Did she try anything
because of that..
I don't know.
But DySP Mr. Varma..
- I am not DySP Mr. Varma.
I am the one who
handles this case now.
Do you have anything else to say?
No.
Come.
What has happened has happened.
Why do you want to bother everyone
for a murder that
did not happen, Mr. Thomas?
Oh, no..
Hey. How dare you give
a false statement!
Oh, sir.
I told the truth, sir. - Nonsense.
Oh, don't hit me, sir.
- Damn.
Oh, don't me beat me again, sir.
I will make you spit out the truth.
- Oh.. God. Oh, sir.
Oh!
Move.
Walk!
- Oh, no.
Stand straight.
When your neighbour,
Ouseppachan's daughter-in-law died
did you hear anything
fall in that house?
Yes.
- Did you? - No.
Why didn't you hear it?
We weren't there at that time.
Where were you?
I had gone with my wife
to the Guruvayur temple.
Okay.
What is your opinion about Sunny,
Sreedharan?
He is a good man.
What about when he is drinking?
While drinking..
- Yes?
I have not seen him getting drunk.
What about Mr. Ouseppachan?
He is a fraud, sir.
He is a bad man.
Alex
take him in for another round.
Oh!
No, sir.
I will tell the truth.
Alex is a good man.
I mean,
Mr. Ouseppachan is a good man.
He is big-hearted, kind
and someone who is loved
by everyone.
Why didn't you say
this to Mr. Varma? - Well, I..
Because.. - You won't tell him.
Aren't you Ouseppachan's tenant?
Didn't you give a false
statement fearing an eviction?
Am I right?
- Yes.
He is crooked, Alex.
Get his statement immediately.
Oh, keep it there.
No. I am on duty.
It is a Remy Martin, sir.
I have been wearing the uniform
for many years, Mr. Ouseppachan.
All the cases I have handled
have not crossed
the limits I have set.
Narayanan told me.
As I am not used
to being ungrateful
I, DySP Devadas, am
considered me to be the loyal
officer in the department.
Arrest the culprits

- Stop! I said, stop!
Three of you, come with me.
Stand over there.
You stand here.
What's your problem?
Don't you know it?
- Hey, old hag!
There is no use in
shouting over here.
Let me tell you something.
I'll do my best if you're
ready to co-operate.
Else I'll make you regret.
We'll protest against you!
Shut up!
- Devadas should do his duty!
I know how to deal
with you people.
Devadas should do his duty!
Devadas should do his duty..
Devadas should do his duty..
Come in, let's start.
Stop!
'Guest House, Kumarapuram.'
- It should be fair..
Thomachan is here.
- Oh. - Oh.
Have you been waiting for long?
- No, we just reached here.
The minister is inside.
- Who among you is Thomas?
It's me. - The minister wants
to see you. - Come, dear.
I am about
to read the charge sheet.
Please sit.
- No, it's all right.
'The complaint was filed by
Mr. Johny who lives near'
'the Keezhmad-Kanjikuzhy road.'
'Omana, wife
of Johny's Brother-in-law'
'Mr. Sunny of Kilivathil family'
'committed suicide'
'by jumping off the terrace
of the two-storeyed house'
'owned by Mr. Ouseppachan,
Johny's father-in-law'
'as she felt her life was hopeless'
'on June 29, 1987, Tuesday,
at 8 p.m.' - Oh, God!
I understand the grief that your
daughter's untimely death
has brought upon you.
But I'm helpless
as the police investigation
proved that it was suicide, sir.
Sir, I've something to tell you.
Please.
We're not happy with the way
the police investigated this case.
Why? - Initially, Mr. Varma was
in charge of the investigation.
But he was removed from
the position suddenly.
No.. You are wrong.
What you said is not true.
Varma was already investigating
another case when he was
asked to investigate this one.
Another officer
was assigned to the case as
Varma had to resume the
investigation of the other case.
How will we get justice
if you give silly excuses?
Why are you overreacting
when the victim's family is not?
Please go outside.
Understand that it's not practical
to choose the investigating
officer of every single case
according to the public's choice.
Moreover, the investigation
of this case is done and dusted.
The cops beat us up when we marched
to Ouseppachan's house
to state that the case should
be investigated again.
The cops were
just doing their duty.
They are
supposed to enforce the law.
You shouldn't have marched
to Ouseppachan's house, Thomachan.
If you had
anything to say to him
you should have
done that in person.
Is it wrong
to protest for our rights, sir?
You shouldn't protest for your
rights if it'd get you beaten up.
Do one thing.
Don't bother anymore
about the investigation officer.
If there were any flaws
in the investigation, give me
a written complaint and I'll
take necessary action.
Sir.. - I'm in a hurry.
See you, Thomachan.
Send a petition to the home
minister the Supreme Court
and the additional secretary.
Mention all the
details that I just said.
If you have
any doubts, you may
come here.
I'll be here as the court
is closed today.
Okay.
- Okay, sir. - Okay.
The Chief Justice.
- Supreme Court of India.
Tilak Mag, New Delhi.
To whom should the next
one be addressed? - Next..
Additional private secretary.
Grievances.
Write that in brackets.
Okay.
- Prime Minister's Secretariat.
Third block, New Delhi.
To the Union Minister
of Home Affairs.
Third block, New Delhi.
Pin them together.
- Okay.
The Supreme Court of India
this day order
the crime petition number
crime 25/86 of Kumarapuram
police station, Kerala state
to be investigated by the
deputy superintendent of police
Central Bureau of Investigations,
Kerala circle.
Dad, a rickshaw is coming our way.
Get in, dear.
Take us to the CBI office.
What is it?
Have a seat.
You've been told to go inside.
Sit down.
Are you Mr. Thomas,
who filed this petition?
Yes, sir.
As per the order of the
Supreme Court, the CBI
will be investigating this case.
We wanted to
ask you some things
before the
investigation gets underway.
That's why you
were asked to come.
Sethu, please come here.
It is not often that the CBI
investigates a case which
the state
police had referred.
It is yet to prove whether this is
a case of murder.
It is not possible
to investigate this case
based on the details mentioned
in this petition
and some hypothesis.
So, we expect
your full cooperation.
Mr. Sethu, you are deputed for the
enquiry of the Omana murder case.
Thank you, sir.
He is Mr. Sethurama Iyer,
DySP of CBI.
He'll be investigating this case.
He is Thomas and
she is Annie, his daughter.
Complainants.
Sethu has some questions for you.
Sethu, please take them.
- Yes, sir. - Come.
Sir, please help me.
- You are to only tell the truth.
I will, sir.
- Okay.
Come.
Sit down.
Was Omana's marriage
a love marriage?
No, it was an arranged marriage.
- I see.
You and Ouseppachan are
on different levels
when it comes to money.
I wasn't suggesting
that the marriage shouldn't
have happened because of that.
But I couldn't help asking.
Were there any special interests
behind this marriage?
No. Ouseppachan
wasn't this rich at that
point in time.
Ouseppachan has told me that my
daughter is the reason for all the
prosperity his family enjoys now.
I see.
Ouseppachan and you aren't
on good terms now, are you?
No.
How long has it been since
the marriage? - Five years.
Can you brief me on all the key
incidents that happened
during the last five years?
- Yes, sir.
Come on, tell me.
Come here.
Come on!
Go.
This is my eldest daughter, Omana.
Dear, hand him the cup.
You may go inside.
Not so fast!
How is he?
- Stop teasing me!
Did you like him?
You did like him!
My son liked her.
If we get to know
Omana's decision
let's discuss the rest.
My daughter will
agree to my decision.
Then again, to get her married
off so soon..
There is something
else that we should..
Things are pretty much
straight forward, Thomachan.
My son had to like her.
He liked her
and I told you about it.
All I want to know now
is your decision.
If you are okay with it,
let's choose a date after Easter.
As you wish.
There is something else that we
should.. - I get you.
Let's not discuss about dowry.
She is your daughter and you can
give her what you wish to.
It doesn't
matter what you give her.
God bless you!
The complainant ended up
behind bars!
I don't care about those people!
Thomachan, the auspicious
time will be over by 4:30 p.m.
We've to reach home before that.
Daughter.
Come, it's time.
Come.
Come
I am leaving.
Their married life
was jovial.
They used to visit us
once in a while.
We used to visit them too.
Ouseppachan started a new business
with Johny's help.
Who is Johny?
Sunny's brother-in-law.
What kind of business? - He
started with small contract works.
Sunny got business
as the business grew.
And their visits became rare.
But that never affected
our relationship.
Okay.
Hello.
Speaking.
Kamalam, tell me what it is.
Give it to him.
One minute.
It's from home.
Raja, father here.
Be a good boy and got to school.
No, you must go to school.
Okay?
When I come home in the evening
I'll bring you Eclairs, chocolates
and everything.
Okay?
Promise.
Okay.
Now tell me.
One day, Ouseppachan came home
to meet father.
As you know, along with Johny
I have started a small business.
I have given all my assets
to the government for it.
That is why I am doing this.
I never thought the loan
would be passed so soon.
That's when
this cropped up.
They are demanding
for collateral security.
I am asking you since
I have no other choice.
How can I let go of the loan
because I can't give
a collateral security?
I won't be able to complete
the bridge construction contract
if I don't get the loan.
So please help me.
I am happy to help you.
Let me discuss it with Annie.
- Okay.
What are you asking me?
Will I ever say no?
Then give me the documents.
Here.
May God bless you.
Everything will be fine.
Ask me and I will get it back
within a month's time.
You'll have to come
to the bank too.
I will inform you.
You have to sign as a guarantor.
- I'll come.
And Ouseppachan left
with the documents.
What happened after that?
His business flourished very fast.
He got a car, a big house,
servants
and started a few more businesses.
I have heard that men new money
can be arrogant.
But I experienced it.
He was ashamed to keep
a relationship with me.
But I bore with it.
For my elder daughter.
And?
- I had a dire need for money.
Since I had no money
I planned to sell my plot.
I went to meet Ouseppachan
to get my documents back.
Why do you need money?
Haven't I mentioned to you
about my late sister once?
She has two sons.
The elder one got
into police somehow.
The younger one is unemployed.
He's got a job offer in Dubai.
He needs money for Visa.
I promised him that I
would arrange some.
Why did you make such promises,
Thomachan?
Please don't talk like that.
All the land I have
is ancestral property.
Even I am not legally bound to
but I want to
give them a share of it.
I have mentioned this to them too.
What am I supposed to do?
As you know I have no
other means for money.
So if you give me back
the documents
I will sell some plot
to get some money for him.
How can I get it if you
ask all of a sudden?
Bank won't give it
unless you close the loan.
Won't they?
Then at least lend me Rs. 15,000.
Well..
What are you saying?
I am trying hard
to make some money.
Only God knows my hardship.
You told me that
you would get it back
within a month when I need it.
Don't lie, Thomachan.
I never said that.
Hello, Mr. Ousep here.
Sir! This is Ouseppachan.
What is there to ask?
How can I say not to you?
No.
There is nothing like that.
I will get you as much as you want.
There's no need for that.
I will bring it myself.
Okay, sir.
Did you get your documents back?
Yes.
After a month.
After that,
we were distant.
Did you meet after that?
No matter what,
how can I not see my child?
One day, I went to meet her.
Please don't be so cruel.
Please let me see my child.
- Not possible.
Don't you have a daughter too?
Please let me see her.
I told you it is not possible.
Dear!
Father.
- Dear!
What are you doing?
- Vasu. - Yes.
Please let me see her.
- No.
Leave me.
- Throw him out.
Father!
- Leave me.
Leave.
- Come on. - Leave me.
Sunny!
- Father!
Leave me.
- Let me see my father.
Come here.
- Father. - Shut up.
Come on.
- Dear!
Dear!
- Omana. - Father.
Let me see him.
Leave me!
You!
Shut up!
- What do you want?
I will kill you.
- I want to see my father.
You!
You!
- Take her inside.
I said leave me.
Get in!
Did you go there after that?
He never let us see her
even if we did.
I send her letters.
I got few replies.
Later it ceased.
- He might have threatened her.
Where are the letters now?
They might be at home.
So was that your last
encounter with Omana?
No.
Dig..
- Father, sister is hospitalised.
What happened?
- She consumed poison. - What?
Daughter!
Sister.
- Omana.
Dear.
Why did you do this?
Tell me, dear.
Dear.
Tell me.
Daughter!
- Please.
Dear.
- Please wait outside.
Father. - Dear.
- Come on, Father.
When I saw her next time,
she was lying still.
How many days after the fight
you had with Ouseppachan
about the documents
did she poison herself?
A few days, I think.
I don't remember the exact date.
Only cowards try to commit suicide.
You daughter already tried it once.
Still, you think that her
death is not suicide.
Why do you think so?
My nephew, Chacko,
is in the police.
He was also a part
of the case investigation.
He felt suspicious about the
evidence and testimonies.
So he reported it to Mr. Varma
who was investigating the case.
He felt the same too.
That is when he was removed
from the case.
Tell Chacko to meet me
tomorrow
at this hotel at 7 p.m.
Tell him to ask the receptionist.
Do you have anything
further to ask?
No, you may leave.
Okay, sir.
How did the session go?
As I expected
I can ignore 99 percentage of it.
So it is not going to be hard,
is it?
Yes.
Let's close this file
after an investigation
just for formality,
shall we?
We'll support the findings
of the state police.
Wait.
I am meeting
constable Chacko tomorrow.
I will give you my final
opinion after that.
Mr. Sethuraman.
- Room number 302.
Thank you.
Aren't you Chacko?
Yes, sir.
- Come in.
I asked you to come here
since the matter is personal.
Sit down.
Don't worry.
Have a seat.
In such a case,
I am aware of the complications
that could be produced by the
involvement of a police officer.
I am not going to record anything.
You don't have to sign
on any statements either.
I came to know that you had
certain doubts about this case
from Thomas and Annie.
What made you think that
this is a case of murder?
The doctor had testified that the
death had happened 15 hours ago.
The postmortem had taken
place at 11 a.m. the next day.
So, she would've
died at around 8 p.m. on that day.
But there was a heavy rain till
9:30 p.m. on the day she died.
I was on duty on that day.
Both Balakrishnan Nair and I
went for dinner once the
rain stopped at 9:30 p.m.
If Omana had committed
suicide at 8 p.m.
her body would have
been covered with dirt.
Also, her blood would have
mixed in the rainwater.
These are the doubts I had.
The doctor's statement
was taken by the SI.
There was a contrast between
his statement and the
postmortem report.
The 15 hours which was
there in his statement
was reduced to 13 hours
in the certificate.
Why didn't you question
the doctor about this?
It wasn't required.
- Correct.
They would've dealt with them.
What if that was a genuine mistake?
That can be said
for argument's sake.
But I really don't think so.
I think his first statement
happened to be a truth by accident.
But his postmortem report
is in favour of suicide.
He must have been forced into it.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chacko.
We shall meet again.
Thank you, sir.
Reception.
I'll be vacating the room soon.
Please send me the bill.
Chacko.
Do Chacko's points seem valid?
Especially, when there
is a contrast between
the doctor's statement and
his postmortem report?
Let them accept the postmortem
report in legal terms.
But this contrast between
his statement and
the postmortem report
is a loophole for us to work.
So you are in the game.
Have you decided to
proceed with it? - Yes, sir.
Especially after
yesterday's incident.
That has accelerated
my doubts in this case.
A policeman might
have many enemies. - Of course.
But considering the
present situation
I don't think that is the case.
Well, then you can proceed.
- Yes, sir.
Who do you want to assist you?
I would prefer Circle Inspector,
Harry
and Sub-Inspector, Vikram.
- Okay.
Send Harry and Vikram.
The DIG there is an
old friend of mine.
You should meet him first.
He will do the needful. - Sir.
Vikram and Harry?
- Yes, sir.
Sethu wants you to
assist him in this case.
What do you have to say?
- With pleasure, sir.
Sethu, you can carry on.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, this is your property. It has
all the details about this case.
I am aware that the
local police is not happy
in handing over
this case to CBI.
But as responsible officers
both my team and I wish
to do this efficiently.
I need your full cooperation.
- Of course, I will do my best.
Thank you, sir.
Meet Mr. Devadas.
This is DySP Sethurama Iyer
from CBI.
Mr. Swamy?
- Yes.
How do you do?
- Fine, thank you.
'Malaria prevention awareness
week. - Beloved friends.'
'Today at 3 p.m.,
at the Panchayat Community Hall.'
'The honourable Health Minister
will inaugurate'
'the Cure Malaria Week'
'in association with
Kumarapuram Panchayat'
'and the Kerala Health Department'
'Do come forward to check your
blood to cure malaria.'
'The health service officers'
'would be examining your blood'
'for one week from tomorrow.'
'Kindly cooperate with us'
'and come forward to
cure this disease.'
Where are our rooms?
One is this one and
the other is upstairs.
Vikram. - Give this to me.
Take this upstairs.
Dad is really scared
after knowing that
the CBI is camping
in that guest house.
There is nothing to be scared.
You should never deviate
from your statement.
They won't be able to find
anything as long as you do that
Like a man can him can
investigate a murder case.
Did you meet him?
- Yes, I did.
I got introduced to him
at the DIG's office.
Sunny is there inside.
Give it to him.
How did it go?
- It was okay.
Shall I go?
- Okay.
I am leaving.
Come here.
Don't forget to give
me the balance.
I had paid you the other day.
- There is no fixed rate for this.
Isn't there an end to this?
I cannot talk to Ouseppachan again.
I don't know. I need the
cash by tomorrow afternoon.
I am capable of changing
a murder to suicide and vice versa.
I will call you tomorrow
afternoon. - Don't call me.
I will call you.
Let's go.
What is the matter?
- Nothing.
I know
what he would have told him.
He is planning to buy some
land and a building in the city.
He would be in need of some
money to pay for it.
Even I am leaving.
My car is in the workshop.
He had even called me today.
Please give me some time.
I will do the needful.
You cannot say so.
I will send my son to
your office tomorrow.
Please come and
drop me to my home.
Go ahead.
- Nuisance.
The people who wanted to buy
our estate didn't turn up.
You should go along with him
and enquire about it tomorrow.
It's okay if they want it
for a lesser amount.
Why do you want
to make a loss?
Let them approach us.
- Nobody asked your opinion.
It's all because of you.
Johny, go and do the needful.
- Okay.
Chapatti
and vegetable curry was amazing.
Make this every day.
Right, Vikram?
Yes..
Hey.
- Yes?
He will ask you to make this daily.
- Yes.
But we need some real food.
Real food?
Hey, we need
a little fish and meat!
Okay.
- Vikram.
Vikram.
- Yes, sir?
We should start
our investigation tomorrow.
I'll explain the modus operandi.
So..
We should investigate
this case in three stages.
We should first investigate
if there were any corruption
in the investigation
of the crime 25/86.
Only then will there be any reason
in CBI investigating this case.
The second stage
of the investigation
is to find whether Omana's death
was murder or suicide.
Our job will be over
soon if it's suicide.
On the other hand,
if it's a murder
Our actual headache
will start then.
That's where our investigation's
third stage will begin.
We can't expect anything from
the police report we got.
The police who referred this case
are capable of twisting any case.
My headache already started.
- That's because you're sober.
Listen carefully.
Yes, sir.
- Vikram.
You should take a stroll around
this village tomorrow.
You should investigate everything
about Ouseppachan's business.
Find out who are his close friends
in which bank he's got accounts
and other details if you can.
- Yes, sir.
I'll go and meet
DYSP Mr. Varma who investigated
this case first.
You should go
to the telephone exchange, Harry.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
I'm Sethuraman from CBI.
- Please, take a seat.
Thank you, sir.
- I heard that you've reached.
I thought I'll meet you before
I start the investigation.
Also, I had some doubts.
Constable Chacko told
there were some contradictions
in the testimony of the doctor
who did the postmortem.
Did you question that doctor again?
They removed me from
the case before that.
Do you suspect anyone?
Anyone can be a suspect
if you want.
There were loopholes
in everyone's testimonies.
I didn't even complete
my first round investigation.
They probably had a problem
with my investigation before that.
An order out of nowhere.
I got a transfer to the rural.
Anything can happen
in the Home Department.
Who will ask them?
Mr. Sethu, I'll do one thing.
I wrote down my assumptions
about the case in my diary.
That's in my office.
I'll send it to you.
I don't think
it will be very useful.
It'd be worth a reference.
Okay, sir. I stay
in the guest house. I'll leave.
My wife is not here. That's why
I'm not offering you coffee.
Oh, it's all right.
- Okay.
Mr. Sethu.
- Sir.
May you achieve what I couldn't.
I wish you all success.
- Thank you, sir.
Yes? Take a seat.
- Thank you.
DySP Sethurama Iyer had sent this.
- Okay.
KA Ousep, telephone number
326 and 324.
Kilivathikkal Plantations
and Constructions
telephone number 421.
Joy Mathew, telephone number 376.
K. Narayanan 388.
Sunny Ousep 342.
Are these numbers and names
in this exchange? - Yes.
I need the details
of the trunk calls.. - Yes.
...made from these numbers
from June 1987 till November.
Well..
Don't you have the duplicate
of the telephone bill? - Yes.
A copy of that will suffice.
- That won't be an issue
but it'll take time
to find the original.
That's okay.
If you don't mind, I'll wait.
Okay.
Get me the keys
to the records room.
Where do you stay, Mr. Harry?
- In the guest house. - Okay.
'K.A. Ouseppachan and company.
Kilivathuckal planations.'
Yes? What do you want?
- I wanted to see the owner.
The owner is not here.
- Oh, God! I must see him.
May I sit?
- Yes.
Who are you?
- My name is Vishnu Nambuthiri.
I'm from Memana house.
It's little to the north.
I have done my Bachelors.
I work in Tanjavoor bank.
- What should I do?
Our bank is opening a branch here.
So? - We need a few
good and respectable accounts.
I heard that
KA Ousep and Group
are the prominent ones here.
You should give
some of your business to us.
What's the use in talking to me?
You should talk to the owners.
I met them.
They said they don't know anything.
They said you are the one who
handles all their businesses.
That's correct.
But
Oriental Bank and State Bank
provide a lot of facilities.
Also, Ouseppachan is one
of the directors of Oriental Bank.
So how can KA Ousep and Group
give you business?
So, all your business
is with Oriental Bank, isn't it?
Most of it.
And since we have
government contract
we have business in State Bank too.
You deal with State Bank too,
is it?
Oh, Lord Shiva! You should
at least give us your SB account.
It'll be a good sign.
Yes.
We can think about that.
So I have achieved
what I came here for.
That's great!
Did they suspect you?
- No, sir.
So their main accounts
are in Oriental Bank, is it? - Yes.
We'll go there tomorrow.
Did you get it?
- Yes, sir.
Most of the calls are from
Narayanan's number. - Yes, sir.
So, Chacko was right.
We'll meet Narayanan.
What is it?
- Is Mr. Narayanan inside?
Yes. But he's on the phone.
Who are you?
Anirudhan.
We are from block office.
We want to meet him.
- He's on the phone.
Tell him it's urgent.
Go.
Is it you, Doctor?
Why did you call me?
Why are you worried, doctor?
Stay strong.
Yes. They are staying
in the guest house.
He's a Brahmin.
Sethuraman,
or some other Raman.
There are others with him.
What? There are no idiots
among Brahmins, is it?
There is nothing to worry about.
Times have changed.
Everyone is paid these days.
No. They didn't come here.
Ouseppachan said
they didn't go there either.
Oh, what will happen?
Ouseppachan will have
to spend more money
Yeah, right.
Are the CBI against money?
Okay. I'll hang up now.
I'll see you later.
Someone from Block Office
is here to see you.
I was planning to come there.
I heard that you got
TxD in the office.
High yielding banana saplings
have arrived too.
Mr. Pattabiraman is in
charge of that.
Mr. Pattabiraman.
It's not Pattabiraman.
It's Sethuraman.
I'm a Brahmin. We are from CBI
and not Block office.
Please, sit.
You have a lot of contacts
among ministers, don't you?
No. Who told you this?
I'm a simple man, sir.
Once, I lost
in an assembly election.
That's my only connection
with politics.
Haven't you called
many ministers and their PAs
at their houses and guest houses?
Who told you
such nonsense about me?
I don't know any ministers.
And I haven't called them either.
Is 388 your phone number?
- Yes.
This is the duplicate copy of the
trunk call bill from this number.
The numbers marked in red
are the numbers
of various guest houses.
We have evidence
that the minister was there
on the day you called.
The numbers marked in blue are
the home number of ministers,
IG's and their PAs in Trivandrum.
What do you say now, Mr. Narayanan?
You are not
involved in politics at all, is it?
That's the duplicate copy
of the trunk calls
made from this phone
from June 30th to November 30th.
Ouseppachan's daughter-in-law
died on June 29th.
And Ouseppachan
is your closest friend.
This death was referred to
as a suicide very diplomatically.
Doesn't any of these mean anything?
Shall we go?
You are driving on the wrong side.
Be careful.
Didn't you say that there
is no need to worry?
And that nothing will happen.
Look at what happened now.
What happened?
If anything has happened,
it is all because of him!
But what did I do?
Why did you tell them that you
don't know any ministers?
It would've been another problem
if I'd agreed.
Rubbish! He is an idiot!
Any person would say that he
knows some or the other minister
at least for the sake of status.
Nobody has said that having
a friendship
with a minister is a sin.
You are a social worker, a leader
and a business magnate.
You will have connections
with the ministers!
How does that matter to CBI?
Yes, why should they care?
You should have asked them
and not me.
But you never asked them.
Narayanan, do you know
where you went wrong?
When they asked you initially,
you disagreed.
When they displayed the evidence,
you had no words to say.
They finely got you into a trap.
If you had told them firmly
before itself
they would not have questioned
you further.
By the way, they will come
to interrogate you guys as well.
They will move tactfully
to trap you.
But don't fall into their traps.
I wonder when they will
come to me?
Even I am thinking of taking
a leave for two months.
Let us hope that our first stage
of the investigation will end
after inspecting Oriental Bank
and Ouseppachan's office.
Sir, DySP Devadas has made a deal
to buy ten cents of land
and a building near this main road.
I got to know from a land broker.
It might not be registered
in his name.
We shall show you the necessary
records. - Thank you, sir.
Please wait.
I have presented the cheque again.
He has gone for collection.
It might take some time.
We will wait till then.
Hey! Wait for a minute.
- Yes?
That cashier's name is Gopalan,
right? - No.
Then? - He is Ramananda Pai,
son of Mr. Devendra Pai
doing the mosaic business.
- Okay.
Why did you ask?
- Nothing. He looked familiar.
Can you buy a pack of cigarettes?
- Let me ask the manager. - What?
Hello! Were you searching for me?
- Who searched for you?
I am the Gopalan you were
searching for.
I was searching but not now.
Excuse me!
- Yes?
Can I get change for Rs. 100?
Your name is Ramananda Pai, right?
- Yes.
How is your father's mosaic
business going on?
It is a bit dull now.
- Okay.
Do you know my father?
- Of course.
We are old friends.
Just a month ago,
he had spoken to me about you.
Did you say last month?
- Yes.
But my dad passed away four
years ago.
F-Four years?
Oh my, God!
It feels like yesterday.
Life is so unpredictable.
By the way, Mr. Pai, do you
have foreign exchange here? - Yes.
Okay. Do you have any problem
with the dealing?
Can we take this ledger book?
But sir, we need it for our
daily use.
Do one thing, Harry.
- Tell me, sir.
Make a note of the required
details. - Okay, sir.
If required, you will have
to submit
these books to the court.
- Yes, sir.
By the way, nobody else should know
about our arrival here.
I think you have understood.
- Okay, sir.
Thank you very much.
See you, Harry.
Mr. Vikram, now we will go
to Ouseppachan's office.
I am not Vikram for the time
being, sir. - What?
I am Vishnu Namboodiri.
- Oh, yes! Come on!
Greetings.
- Oh, please come in..
Please come.
How are you?
Did you open the new branch yet?
We will start today.
- Okay.
Our manager has come along.
I wanted to introduce him.
Of course!
With pleasure.
Hello!
I am Krishnan, chief accountant of
KA Ousep and Group of companies.
I am K. Sethurama Iyer
from CBI.
Oh! Central Bank of India.
- No.
Central Bureau of Investigation.
- What?
But he was talking about some
bank.
N-Not at all. I am also from CBI.
Sub Inspector, Vikram.
By the way, Mr. Krishnan
we need to inspect your accounts.
- For what?
Do you need to know the reason?
- No need. - Good.
Vikram! You can proceed.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, we have got a lot of problems
from sales tax
and income tax people.
There was a raid last week.
Do you know what happened?
Mr. Krishnan, you don't have
to struggle speaking English.
Malayalam would sound better.
Yes, sir.
I am coming to Malayalam.
Mr. Krishnan, get the ledger book
and cash book of '87 and '88.
Those are with the auditor, sir.
Will you give it yourself
or should I make you get it?
No need, sir. I will bring it..
- Then go and bring it.
Come on.
Is that all?
Look, there is one more.
Come with me.
Sir, Rs. 30,000 was drawn
from the Oriental Bank
with a cheque number 006848
on July 10, 1987.
But it is not recorded
in this book.
But, sir..
- Wait..
Note that and seize the book!
- Yes, sir.
What is happening? Who are
these people? - The CBI.
Good that you came, sir.
They were threatening me
and were trying to inspect
these books.
What is all this, sir?
- Didn't you understand?
For what crime are you scrutinising
me this way?
I have been tolerating
this for the last six months.
First, it was Mr. Varma.
Then Mr. Devadas and now it is you.
I have no peace at home
or in the office.
What mistake have I made?
A person died in my house.
But how can you harass me
for that?
I am also a citizen and I have all
the rights to know the reason.
Mr. Ouseppachan!
There is no use of shouting!
We will examine and finish
our inspection.
Do not try to interfere
with our duties!
Vikram, are you done?
- Yes, sir.
Please move aside.
Overall, a withdrawal
of Rs. 3,60,000
is not recorded here.
- Okay.
We are taking these books.
You can approach the court
to get these back. Come on.
Sir, these people..
The first stage of this
investigation is over.
Mr. Narayanan's telephone bills
and the misappropriations
in the accounts of Ouseppachan
prove the corruption
involved in the investigation
of this case.
Tomorrow, we'll start
the second stage of our
investigation at Ouseppachan's
house.
Before that, we need to meet
DySP Devadas.
Would that be of any help?
He's a brute.
Let us see.
Do you know about this Devadas?
This happened when I was working
in Thiruvalla.
Have you heard about the Kochi
murder case?
A 14-year-old girl called Radha
was strangled to death
for revealing her mother's
extra-marital affair.
Devadas was the one who converted
that murder to suicide.
Look who it is!
Please, come.. Take a seat.
I had expected you earlier.
- I was a little occupied.
The newspapers write about you
every single day!
The CBI shouldn't be seeking
publicity, should they!
Anyway. Would you like some
tea or coffee or perhaps some
spiced buttermilk? I was just
asking as you are a Brahmin!
Please, I am good.
I went through
your case diary, sir.
I've certain doubts.
- Feel free to ask me.
Vasu, the driver,
was a key witness.
I didn't find
his testimony in the case diary.
I didn't find it necessary.
There are a lot of contradictions
between the doctor's
testimony and the autopsy reports.
You could've questioned the doctor
at least to clarify those doubts.
Really?
Testimony is verbal and so, it
could be wrong.
Even we can make mistakes.
As per Indian
Evidence Act
what's significant
is the post-mortem certificate.
Because it is a signed document.
One need not rack his brains
to this degree to determine
if a death is a homicide
or suicide.
If one is intelligent,
his instincts will help
him figure it out.
You aren't
answering my question.
I'll repeat.
I asked about the doctor who
conducted the post-mortem.
I have explained
my conclusions.
Okay, sir.
I shall leave then.
There was a pivotal
evidence which you failed
to take not of, sir.
- What is that?
How come you failed to take not of
it since you are intelligent!
Hello.
Is this Mr. Devadas, the DySP?
It's me, Ouseppachan.
The CBI team are on my terrace
with a couple of dummies!
I've no idea what they are up to.
Yes, I have informed
Narayanan as well.
Please come over
to my place, sir. Okay.
Is everything ready, Mr. Vikram?
- Yes, sir.
Bring the dummy here.
Is the weight of the dummy
the same as that of the dead body?
Did you check it?
- It is correct, sir. I checked it.
Wait..
Imitate someone throwing
a body off the terrace. Like this.
Keep it like this.
Like this. Yes, like that.
Are you ready?
- Ready, sir. - Come on.
Vikram!
Mark it. - Yes, sir.
Harry, take the other one.
- Okay, sir.
This dummy's fall should mirror
someone committing suicide.
That's how you must throw it off.
Keep the position like this
then throw it.
- Okay.
Throw it.
See the difference!
Vikram, note the distance
between the two bodies.
Dummy to dummy,
four feet.
Dummy to the wall.
First dummy. - First dummy to the
wall, 12.5 feet.
Second dummy to the wall,
eight feet.
How much is there?
Dummy to dummy,
four feet. - Okay.
First dummy to the wall,
12.5 feet.
Second dummy to the wall,
eight feet. - Good.
Over. Remove the dummies.
- Okay, sir. Remove it.
Do you think the dead
body would've been found
at the spot mentioned in the
inquest if it was suicide?
No, sir.
- So.
That is it, sir.
Sir.
- What?
CBI stands for
Cental Bureau of Investigation
and not for
Cental Bureau of Idiots.
Wait and watch. Things
will be moving real fast now.
Hello.
Sir.
This is the spot where
Omana's dead body was found.
Yes, sir.
How far apart was the
dead body from the wall?
12.5 feet, sir.
- Yes.
The second dummy we threw
off the terrace.. - Yes.
How far apart was from the wall
was its fall? - Eight feet.
Okay.
So
there is a difference of
four feet among the two falls.
That is a very
important point.
There is no way
that she would've
fallen so apart
from the wall
if it was suicide.
What do you say?
- You are right, sir.
What about you?
I'm not trying to argue here.
- Okay.
She would have probably
fallen here.
Isn't it possible that
that she would have rolled over
till there because of the pain?
Oh, yes.
You are correct.
We can
also think of it that way.
Where are the photographs
of the dead body?
It is in the room, sir.
- Bring it.
Would the corpse have rolled over
if it was thrown out
after she was dead?
We don't know
if she was thrown
off the terrace alive or dead, sir.
As per your hypothesis
the dead body fell
at this spot and would have
rolled to this spot.
In that case
there would have
been blood stains over here.
Do you find any blood
stains there in this photo?
Do you see any?
- No, sir.
Okay. That means, she would have
fallen at this point itself.
What do you say?
- I am sorry, sir.
Don't feel sorry. You asked
a very intelligent question.
That is why we checked
these photographs now.
We have come to another
conclusion as well.
Omana was thrown off
the terrace after she was dead.
If she was thrown out alive
the body would have rolled
over as Harry said.
And this distance would
not have been 12.5 feet.
That means Omana's death
occurred somewhere else.
Bring her sari.
- Yes, sir.
Did the autopsy reports mention
any injuries beneath her hip? - No.
How come
there is a blood stain here?
This sari must be sent for the
forensic test tomorrow morning.
Yes, sir.
You bloody CBI!
You bloody CBI!
Come out!
Come out here!
Hey, Brahmin boy!
How dare you fool me by
showing a fake telephone bill?
How dare you mess with me!
Wait and watch.
I will send you and your
stupid team packing from here!
Not only do I have contacts
in Thiruvananthapuram
but I have contacts
in Delhi as well.
Come out here!
Harry.
- What did you say?
Don't you dare mess with me!
Come out here!
Get down here!
Harry, wait. - Get down here!
- Go inside, man.
Go. - You!
- Vikram, go with him.
Are you trying to scare me?
You will tremble with fear!
All of you will
tremble with fear!
All of you would tremble
with fear at the sight of
real men!
All of you will tremble with
fear! I'll send you packing.
I will go to Delhi.
I will go to Delhi.
I will go to Delhi.
I will..
I was obeying you.
Or else..
Idiots shout for no reason.
To provoke us.
We should not react to it.
That's not our job.
Vikram.
- Sir.
Did you go to driver Vasu's house?
- Yes, sir.
His wife said that he is not there.
Find him wherever he is.
- Yes, sir.
Sir.
- Yes.
How about a re-postmortem
of Omana's body?
Yes, we will think about it.
Hello, Sethuraman here.
Sorry for disturbing you
in this late night.
I've got news about Vasu.
Where is he?
- Hotel Prashant in the town.
He's in room number 108.
What?
- I have something to tell you.
Who are you?
Did you observe him?
There is no reaction on his face.
See, he's taking that paper.
'Omana murder case.'
'Driver Vasu on the run.'
'Omana murder case.'
'CBI is in search of driver Vasu.'
Smart!
There is no reaction even after
reading news about him.
'Omana murder case.'
'CBI is in search
of Ouseppachan's goon, Vasu.'
He is a hard nut.
Won't crack so easily.
Harry.
Bring him to my room.
Yes, sir.
At what time did you
drop Ouseppachan home
the day Omana died?
- After 10 p.m.
How do you know?
- Because I had a watch.
We have evidence
to prove that Omana was murdered.
We know what your role
was in it too.
We might be able to help you
if you confess the crime.
If you become the approver
the court will show some mercy
and lessen your punishment.
If you have all the evidence,
why are you questioning me?
Why don't you decide everything?
Harry.
Take him.
Vikram.
- Sir.
Don't give him anything
to eat or drink.
Keep him in there for 24 hours.
Let's see what the result is.
- Sir.
Another thing.
Vasu is not under CBI's custody.
Do you understand?
- Sir.
So search for Vasu at his
and Ouseppachan's house as usual.
Sir.
'Vinayaka Bank.'
Who are you?
Who are you?
- I am Vasu's wife.
Is he in here?
- He is not here.
Where is he?
- I don't know.
It's been two days.
And you are..
- I am from Vinayaka Bank.
Vasu had taken a gold loan from us.
I came to inform you that we'll
sell it if it's not claimed soon.
I am taking this.
Will this be problematic for us?
- No.
I will give you a receipt.
- Thank you.
I don't know whether it belongs
to my sister or not.
Remove your bangle.
Maybe they bought this for her.
How about this?
This belongs to her.
Yes, I bought two bangles.
One for each.
From where did you get this?
I will tell you.
I am leaving.
Whose ornaments are these?
Speak.
These belong to my wife.
What about this?
This..
I don't know.
Vasu, don't try to hide anything.
We have proof that this
belongs to Omana.
We got it from the bank with
the other ornaments you pawned.
This is more than enough
to prove that you killed Omana.
- It didn't do it.
Tell me the truth.
What really happened?
Speak.
You have no other option.
Speak up, Vasu.
I will.
I'll tell you everything.
Vasu.
Vasu.
Why are you here at this hour, sir?
Come with me.
Come with me to
Ouseppachan's house immediately.
I just came from there.
What is the matter?
Well, Omana died.
What?
Died?
What do you mean?
- Sunny made a mistake.
They had a fight.
Sunny slapped her.
He hit her on her pressure point
and she died.
It was unintentional.
What can I do, sir?
We have to frame it as suicide
before anyone finds it out.
But how?
- We will take care of it. Come.
Come.
Vasu.
Fast.
But throwing her from the terrace..
- Don't worry.
We have made this decision
after a discussion.
Make it fast.
How about burning the body?
- That won't do.
This is what really happened.
Why did you pawn it
instead of selling it?
I was scared.
I thought they would doubt
me if I sell it.
That's why I pawned it.
Why did you pawn your wife's
ornaments along with this?
I was in need of some money
to buy a property. - Didn't
Ouseppachan lend you any money?
He did.
But it wasn't enough.
Does he know
that this bangle is with you?
No, he doesn't.
- Okay.
Vikram. - Sir.
- Take him.
Sir. - Yes.
- The SP asked for you. - Okay.
Sir.
- What is the status?
Shall I demand
the arrest warrant?
Not so fast, sir.
- Why?
Now it is crystal clear.
Isn't Vasu's
testimony enough for the arrest?
That is not it, sir.
Certain points
don't link together.
Then tell me.
As per Sunny's testimony
he left home
at 8 o'clock that night.
And Omana and Sunny
had a row before that.
Sunny hit her
on a pressure point,
and so, she died.
However, Sunny wasn't
aware of it then.
Yes.
In that case, Omana's death
occurred around 8 p.m.
Yes.
It is clear.
As per Vasu's testimony
Ouseppachan had returned
home that night at 10 p.m.
He found
Omana dead in her room.
And he calls his son,
son-in-law and Narayanan.
To prevent his son from
being convicted of murder
they framed the death as suicide.
Now listen carefully.
Omana dies at 8 p.m.
Her body was thrown
off the terrace after 10 p.m.
So there is a difference
of more than two hours
between the two incidents.
However, Omana's body was
found lying in a pool of blood.
Yes. Correct.
How long will it take for the blood
to start clotting after death?
One hour. An hour
and a quarter at the maximum.
Heat doesn't stay in a corpse
for more than an hour.
The blood tends to clot as soon as
the heat vanishes from the body.
So, how is it possible that her
body was surrounded
by a pool of blood in spite
of being thrown off the terrace
after nearly two
hours of her death?
You have a point.
Constable Chacko says
that it had rained from
8 p.m. till 9:45 p.m. that night.
So, it is obvious that her body
was thrown off the terrace
after the rain had settled down.
If it were otherwise, her body
would've shown marks of it.
But there wasn't any
and for that, we have proof.
Hence, we can believe
Vasu's statement that Ouseppachan
got home by 10 p.m. that night.
It was around 10:30 p.m. that Vasu
threw the corpse off the terrace.
Yes. That means
that Omana's death occurred
sometime between
9.15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
What if Sunny had left home
at 9.15 p.m. or even earlier?
We have no proof for that.
Neither do they have proof
that he had left at 8 p.m.
No, they don't. And that
is what we have to prove.
Had Sunny left home at 8 p.m.?
Had Sunny hit Omana and
was that the cause of her death?
We've to find the answers to these
questions. - But as per Vasu's
testimony,
we can suspect only Sunny.
Sir, Vasu hadn't
witnessed anything.
Vasu's
testimony is based on what
Narayanan had told him
after Omana's death.
So, if it wasn't Sunny's
assault that caused the death..
Sir, can't we
suspect Mr. Ouseppachan?
We can't say that as of now.
That is yet to be found out.
We are warning you, lady.
If you cry out of no reason..
- What?
I can't hear you.
How long have you
been suffering from hearing loss?
What is he saying?
How long have you
been suffering from hearing loss?
What?
Nothing.
You may leave.. - Okay.
You don't suffer
from hearing loss, right?
I can hear a little.
A little?
I mean, I can't follow
everything one says.
People who cover up a crime
will be
punished severely than the
culprits! So, tell us the truth.
What really happened
on the day Omana died?
Tell us..
I was in the kitchen.
That was when
I heard something fall.
I came to the living room.
Can you
recollect what time it was?
Around 8 p.m.
- And?
You should be taking
care of this house
and not
rejoicing at your house.
So?
Can't I visit my home?
You can't leave now.
No matter what, I will go
home tomorrow! - Why?
I want to see my
father and sister.
And why do you wish to
visit them all of a sudden?
I will go.
- No, you won't.
Father won't let you leave.
I will go no matter
who tries to stop me.
Yeah, right!
I'm warning you.
I won't spare you.
What's your problem here?
You don't understand
mild language, do you!
How many husbands am I
supposed to have in this house!
That is what I want to know!
- Damn! How dare you!
You won't be going anywhere!
Why did you come upstairs?
- W-Well..
Dinner.
- No.
Where are you going?
- To call Ms. Omana
for dinner.
You need not bother
calling her.
She'll have her
dinner if she wants to.
You are the one who is
spoiling her.
You fuel her mind
with wrong notions
when we aren't around.
- I haven't said anything.
Go now.
You may keep it inside.
- Okay.
This
is what had happened.
You claim that you don't
know what happened next.
The power was down.
I went to the kitchen
had my dinner and slept.
- Was it raining then?
Yes, it was raining.
Do you know when the
power was back? - I don't know.
When did Mr. Ouseppachan get home?
- I-I don't know.
When do you usually go to bed?
- Before 9 p.m.
When did you realise
that Omana was dead?
At the break of dawn
Daisy woke me up saying
that the police had arrived.
That was when I came to know
that Ms. Omana was dead.
Had you informed Mr. Ouseppachan
about Omana's and Sunny's row?
Yes. I did.
So, it was him who
asked you to play deaf.
Yes.
- Isn't that right?
What else did he say?
He said
if anybody were to enquire
I was to say that Sunny and
Omana were in good terms.
Don't you know that it is an
offence to hide the truth?
They are rich.
They are capable of doing anything.
They may
finish me off if I say something.
You stated that Omana asked Sunny,
'How many husbands am I'
'supposed to have in this house?'
Had Omana
said anything else?
Did she mention
anybody's name? - No.
Isn't everything you said true?
- Yes, sir.
Don't let her go for now.
Keep her under custody.
- Yes, sir.
Hello?
Yes, this is Sethu, sir.
I'll be there right away, sir.
Yes, sir.
Harry..
Come.
- Sir.
I'm going to the office.
Find Mohammad.
The guy Mary mention about.
Mohammad, who works at
Ouseppachan's store? - Yes, sir.
May I know who Mohammad is?
- What?
I am Mohammad.
What's the matter, sir?
I have some things
to ask you.
What's the matter, sir?
Didn't you send the sari for
testing? This is the report.
My God!
This is a new development!
These aren't the same.
This is 'O' negative and
this is 'A' positive. - Yes.
Omana's blood group was
'A' positive.
How will we find out whose
blood group is 'O' negative?
Shall we do something?
How about we find out the blood
groups of all our suspects?
That is not
as easy as you think, sir.
As of now, the one whom this blood
belongs to, is unaware of this.
If we attempt to check the
blood groups of all our suspects
the person whom this blood
belongs to will become alerted.
He may even abscond.
So, what can we do?
'A week from tomorrow,
Health Service Officers'
'will conduct house-level
blood tests in Kumarapuram.'
There's a way, sir.
Let me enquire.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
I am Sethurama Iyer from CBI.
What is it, sir?
- A few days ago
wasn't there a blood check done
at Kumarapuram for malaria?
Yes.
- Can you give me
the list of people with 'O'
negative blood in that village?
It will take some time.
I will wait.
- Then okay. Come.
Have a seat, sir.
- Okay.
Since it is a rare group
only three were there.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's been a couple of days
since I heard from Vasu.
Where does he stay?
He said the name of some hotel.
He said he would shift soon.
Would the CBI have..
How can that be?
Didn't they come here yesterday
looking for him?
Maybe he doesn't have
a phone at the moment.
That is correct.
Father-in-law,
she is alone at home.
I'll go home and come back.
Father-in-law,
police!
Mr. KA Ousep,
you are under arrest.
What for?
- For the murder of Omana.
You killed her.
And to make it look like suicide
you threw the corpse
from the rooftop of this building.
Mind your words!
She killed herself.
There's enough evidence for it!
How will you arrest me, then?
Harry, bring him.
Come.
Vasu has confessed.
Why did you kill her?
How did you kill her?
I don't know.
I didn't kill her.
Then why did you throw
the corpse down?
That..
- What is it?
Tell me!
Tell me.
- I don't know anything.
I called Vasu here.
That's all.
Ouseppachan,
don't try hiding anything now.
We have all the evidence.
Come on.
Tell me what happened.
Tell me!
What had happened?
Don't ask anything to him.
I will tell you.
I killed Omana.
Are you trying to save your father?
No, sir.
- Then?
We had an argument that day.
She said some things.
- Okay.
I slapped her.
- Okay.
With that, she..
It is for saving me
that they framed it as suicide,
sir.
But I never intended to kill her,
sir.
It might be true
that you slapped Omana.
But she did not die then.
We have made that clear.
So when did Omana die?
How did she die?
Who killed her?
Her murderers are amongst you.
It'd be better if they confess.
Vikram! Bring that packet.
Sir!
This is the saree that Omana wore
on the day of her death.
This is Omana's blood.
But this..
Is someone else's blood.
The owner of this blood
must be the one who killed Omana.
It's difficult to test the blood
of all the suspects.
But I have proof.
The blood is of the group
'O' negative.
It belongs to a 34-year-old man
named Joy Mathew.
Johny alias Joy Mathew.
How did your blood
end up on Omana's saree?
I don't know.
- You don't, do you?
I don't know!
Harry! Bring him.
Now tell me!
He was the only one
who saw you leave
this place at the night
of Omana's death.
How much did he pay you
in order to keep it a secret?
Rs. 25,000.
Joy Mathew alias Johny
please tell the truth.
How did you kill Omana?
At the night of the murder
I came here to discuss
some urgent matters
with my father-in-law.
Father-in-law!
Father-in-law!
Isn't anyone here?
Omana.
Omana.
Omana!
Omana!
Father-in-law!
Leave me!
Father-in-law!
Let go of me!
Father-in-law!
Why are you here?
On my way back
it started to rain.
I sought refuge
at Sreedharan's hut.
When the rain became heavy
the hut started leaking.
I came here to get an umbrella.
You saw me arrive, didn't you?
I did.
- So, you've been here for a while.
Yes.
- Did you come upstairs?
I did.
Come.
You had tried to molest Omana
once before.
As a result, fearing shame
without being able to tell anyone
she had tried to commit suicide.
Hadn't she?
You are an intelligent criminal.
Come on.
Take him.
- Sir!
Vikram, arrest them all.
- Yes, sir.
Bye, Chacko.
- Okay, sir. - Okay.
I am thankful to you.
We doubted many people.
Because of you,
we found the real culprit.
The Lord will bless you.
Bye, then.
Sir, he has a request.
That you must catch Sukumara Kurup,
the wanted criminal.
