I can tease somebody.
CORAÇÃO
Again, he had dreams. Why are
you piercing the pillows
Bring water.
What are you doing?
- Come to your senses.
- Money, money...
Come to your senses.
Flood has come
-Come to your senses
This is not money,
this is cotton
You have put water
on my lakhs
You already have lakhs
How much more do you need?
I want to earn crores.
You don't know the effect of...
...money on me.
It makes me ecstatic and makes merry.
It makes me feel like dance.
It makes me feel like sing.
It makes feel like a flower!
I can do anything for money.
Live or even die or can dance.
Can you take bath. The Pandit is coming.
-Pandit?
He will come
and bring good news
Devi Lakshmi, always
have mercy on this fool
Mother, Eat, drink & have merry,
but do not leave me & go.
Has burnt for long?
-Seth, you are using this...
...same Agarbatti, now leave it
-Five or fifty years...
...when Devi Lakshmi has no
problem, what is your problem?
Tell me, has the Pandit come?
-He is waiting for a long time
See Sethji, I have brought lot of
alliances after choosing a lot.
Keep them inside, I am not
interested in their beauty.
If blind, I will put eyes, if
limp, can put Jaipur legs...
...if fat, not give her food,
but she should be the...
...only daughter of a man having
crores. Sit down.
Even if not beautiful, the
horoscopes should match
That is okay. But I should get
dowry. I have only one son.
I can only conduct his marriage
once & reap the maximum
- Have tea
- Fool, you want to kill the Pandit?
But I am not giving poison
-There is sugar in tea...
...if Pandit gets diabetes
and dies, then
I don't have diabetes- You have
that danger if you eat sugar
I am ready to take the risk
- I won't allow.
- I won't allow- I'll have.
A fly has fallen in the tea.
Now it is waste.
Panditji, no fly can drink
Hazari Prasad's tea
So, what were you telling
-Your wish is ok...
...but your son's wish is also
necessary.
No need, he is my son and for
seven generations, our family's
...own aim is we can lose
our skin but not money
Were you teasing a
lonely girl?
I was not teasing.
Actually, she...
...looks like my dead sister.
So sad!
lf you don't mind...
...tie this rakhi in my hands.
- Why not? Sure!
Thanks.
Okay, sister.
Keep meeting me
Raja, you narrowly escaped
getting beaten by a slipper
My calculation is straight,
if she accepts, ok, or this rakhi
This eve-teasing of yours has
made us late for college. Come
Raja, is this is the time to
come to college. Answer!
Sir, my father had the fourth
heart attack - Oh my God
You should be in hospital now
-But my lectures, attendance, sir
I will see to all that
-Thank you, sir
Go to the classes.
Where are you all going,
lecture is not over.
Peace! Peace!
Friends, Before 21
years there was a revolution.
Tonight, there will be another.
Today so much beer will...
...flow that flood will come. With
our dance, the earth will tremble
The reason is, today is Raja's
birthday. You all are invited.
This is the bill for the party.
Raja gives only the heart...
...the bill be paid by
my father.
Dad says "He'll make a great name for himself,
my son will do such astounding things!"
But what no one knows
is where my exact destination lies.
Hey Pandu, what is this?
-Can't you see this is a party?
But where are you taking
this Pista & Badam?
For the guests!
- Bring it here.
You don't eat.
Why- The dogs can't
digest the ghee.
You call me a dog!
Who is this?
Look at this bill, Seth
What did you do yesterday?
Will your father pay this bill?
You don't have to ask me for
that. Pay it
Foolish, useless guy-Why are
shouting at him in the morning?
He spent 20,000 in one day
-Wrong, it was 19,800-
Leave it, every day he does'nt
party. It was his birthday.
That was my death day. He has
celebrated 21 birthdays till now
Son, I save money with difficulty
and you are spending it away.
Foolish fellow-Father, Lakshmi
is tired sitting in your locker
So I took her for a ride
-Are you searching something
My motorbike's key
-lt has gone
Where is it?
-With the motorbike.
Where is it?
-I have sold it
Why?-To pay the bill for
your party.
Then, how will I go to college
-Like Gandhi i.e. walking
What have you done?-I have
proved to him, what I am
What?- That I am
your father.
Raja, your party was great
-Your father is very good
Don't take the
name of my father
Hey, blind girl
Has your father given you the
road also along with the car
Why don't you see and walk?
Has your father forgotten...
...to teach you to walk on the
street alongwith manners
Is this a girl or a storm?
-Looks like a new one
Yes, as proud as she is
beautiful-She is fire
If I don't fry papads on this
fire, my name is not Raja
Can't you see and walk,
are you blind?
Is there anyone?
-My God, he is really blind
Please take this, did
you get hurt anywhere
When God has given lifelong
hurt, what are all these hurts?
It is not your fault, it is a sin
to be born blind in this world
It is not like that, can l
leave you somewhere
How does it matter? God has
taken away light of my eyes
To get education, I was going to
my college, i.e. D.K. College
I also study there, let
me leave you there
- Really?
- Yes!
- I can give you a ride.
- No.
No, I don't want to trouble you
-No, please come.
Careful, in which floor
is your class
Forgive me-lt is okay
You keep your hands on my
shoulders
Really you are taking a lot of
difficulty for me- It's nothing
Today you have helped a blind
man. You are very good.
Life has been unjust towards you.
God also sometimes...
Who are you?
Dev, my name is Dev Anand
-Shut up
I will fill love in the
hearts filled with hatred
I can make a stone
into a candle -Get lost
She came & fell on me
like a pillar of current
By God, I enjoyed
the shock
Who the hell are you?
You blackened my face
with the road's dirt yesterday
Yesterday I only blackened you,
today you'll be red with this
She is standing like a stick
Is she a girl or a stick
is she fire or a flower.
She is a like a cracker
Anger in her eyes.
Abuse in her lips
See, friends what does
she think of herself
She is standing like a stick
Is she a girl or a stick
is she fire or a flower.
She is a like a cracker
Anger in her eyes.
Abuse in her lips
See, what does she think
of herself
This white body is made
up of current
It is 440 volts,
Touching is prohibited
This white body is made
up of current
It is 440 volts,
Touching is prohibited
Don't clash with her
and lose your life
No!
She is standing like a stick
Is she a girl or a stick
is she fire or a flower.
She is a like a cracker
Anger in her eyes.
Abuse in her lips
See, friends what does
she think of herself
She has come to the
college to study
But she is always ready to fight.
She has come to the
college to study
But she is always ready to fight.
I have taken a oath that
I will break her pride.
She is standing like a stick
Is she a girl or a stick
Is she fire or a flower.
She is a like a cracker
Anger in her eyes.
Abuse in her lips
See, friends what does
she think of herself
See, friends what does
she think of herself
Keep more waste on that,
don't be a miser.
Seth, keep the weights,
why are you sitting there?
Why, are you weighing gold?
I am 32 kgs, why the weight?
You are 32 kgs., you will be
72 kgs. at least
In this costly age, can one eat
little and become 72 kgs.
Sethji, you are cheating- If you
do business with Hazari Prasad...
...you have to do it
his way only.
Sethji, why are you swinging her,
Lakshmi(money) has come to you
Where is the Lakshmi?- He is
Seth Giridarilal, I told you about
Come and sit down.
Tell me, what I should do
Seth, he has seen your son on
the college's stage & liked him
So there is no problem. Murari,
go and bring two teas, no!
Understood, Lord!
-I also like your daughter
Tell me your expectations
-Expectations
The whole list is ready. See it is
small, Giridarilalji
Hazariji, I am a very small
person. Can't you reduce this?
If you want to reduce, go to the
next shop for your daughter's wedding.
I'll go, but let me
tell you clearly, you are doing...
...waste paper business, but
your list shows that you...
...have to conduct your marriage
with a king's daughter
You and the world will see this
miser doing that one day
I have not walked so much
in my whole life as today
How much more, Sethji?
-Two more steps, Panditji
If I put one step further, I will
die, why are you bent on...
...taking away the life of a
brahmin, could've taken a bus
No need for a bus. 10kms
are over, only 3 kms now.
No, I can't walk
-Get up, what are you doing?
Why are you pushing us?
-My master's car is coming
What were you telling?
-From Delhi hotel, we...
...got a profit of 50 lakhs
-That is peanuts for me
50 lakhs is nothing. It's peanuts,
do you know what is peanuts.
50 lakhs are peanuts
for him
Our London hotel has got a
profit of 2 crores
Only that much, I expected 4
crores, this is a loss for us
You have important meeting with
Mehra Group of Hotels, Dubai
It is impossible today. Today is
my daughter 17th birthday
Please try, sir, it is a matter
of many lakhs
My daughter's birthday comes
once a year. Let the lakhs go
Only daughter of
a millionaire.
What happened? Your son's
alliance people will be waiting
I got the alliance. Heard
God breaks the roof...
...and gives money, but he has
given me from the sky
You mean this rich man!
He will not marry his...
...cook's daughter to
your son.
He will drive you away like mad
and send you to mental asylum
Leave this idea, and let us
go the place, we left for
You don't know this Hazari
Prasad, I have got the...
...rich king, my son's marriage
will take place with his daughter.
For that l
can do anything.
Let God do good for you?
I have taken appointment, sir
-Can we invite quotations...
...from Bennett & Colemen?
-Sure
Today one Hazari company's
is starting.
There is a meeting in
Hazari Shipping company
Looks like a rich man- Must be
a rich heritage, like me.
What was the cost of the
dog roaming- Rs. 500-
Are you mad? 500 rupees for
4 dogs, for that much fifty...
...people will be ready to become
dogs-Dog's days have changed...
...but men's days have not
changed- Take this
Dogs were small, cheat
What were you- Secretary
Give fast, Bachanji is waiting for
me- What is your rate?
Rs. 400- I am broke now.
Should bring up dogs or
become an actor
Nothing matches you
-Have you joined a drama troupe
This is business- Business!
-You will not understand this
Here thousands will go
but crores will come to us
Raja, we accept your guts
-What did I do?
Don't act innocent, now?
You have challenged Karate..
...Champion, Shakti, and asking
us what you did?
I have challenged Shakti!
-What else?
Raja will break every part of
Shakti. That is Raja's challenge
Shakti will come walking but
go back in a cot, what guts?
Raja will die but with a style
-I have not put these posters
What are you telling?
-Whose naughtiness is this?
When fox's death comes, he goes
towads the lion
But when a dog wants to die
he calls a lion for a challenge
Poor one, he will die young
-Now Raja's game is over
Raja, we will not let you down.
I will remove these posters now
If posters go, prestige will also
go. Let me face it now
He has not come, may not come
-Looks he ran away.
Here is our college's champion
for three years, Mr. Shakti
He is Mr. Raja, he had the
guts to challenge Mr. Shakti
But I feel, it will be unjust not
to give him a last opportunity
Mr. Raja, you can still escape
the insult of getting defeated
This is the opportunity,
run away
But one condition, he will fall at
Shakti's feet and ask forgivance
I am ready to fight, but on one
condition. If this Madhu has...
...guts, let her accept it
-What is the condition?
If I win, in front of everyone, l
will kiss Miss Madhu-Okay
But my condition is, if he loses,
he will kiss my friend Mimi
I accept.
but if Mr. Shakti is
defeated, he will kiss Mimi
Friends, as per the condition
Raja will kiss Madhu here
Come, Madhuji, Friends,
give her a big hand
I don't put my mouth on
stupid things
Son, going to the temple.
-Yes
Have you thought about Madhu?
For her only I am going to the
temple to pray to God for her
Where is our daughter, Madhu?
There she is
Father, I want a pill- Ramu did
not give the vitamin pill to you
Oh, daddy, I want a cartridge
-For what
I will kill him. Till I shoot him, l
won't have breakfast
What happened?
He insulted me in front
of everyone.
Insulted? Who?
He caught me in front of
everyone and...- and What
He did'nt do anything - Then
how were you insulted
Let her talk
- Good morning, uncle.
- Hello, Shakti.
- Greetings, grandma.- Greetings.
Son, what is this?
Is everything fine?
Yes- But your lips look
broken to me
Boxing practice became
a bit too much
Don't do such practice that it
becomes difficult to recognize U
When is your father coming from
London?- Next week
I forgot, I have to go to the
temple. you talk, I will go
God bless you, Sethji
Sethji, our God has come
Who is this, look like an
incarnate of King Harishchandra
All of you sit peacefully
What will happen to us poor, if
you are not there.
I consider myself poorer
than you as God has given...
...me lot of wealth but only two
hands to donate.
Wish God had given me thousand
hands for that purpose
Let God do good to you
Mother, you have given me
everything, still I come...
...as a beggar to your temple
to pray to you to give me...
...a good daughter-in-law
as you gave all other things.
I don't need any dowry, but
only a Lakshmi (Goddess of...
...wealth) as a daughter-in-law.
Give me that, mother.
Go
-Yes, sir
Sir, Car's tyre is punctured
-ls there no spare tyre.
Only one, but two are punctured.
I had to go to an important
meeting, what to do?
Brother, If you don't mind,
I will drop you in my car
Why should you be troubled?
Today at least give Vada-Pav
to fill the stomach
Rs. 100-, how in beggar's hands
-Got it from your father
This is illegal note. Go away.
Will handover to the police
He made me fools and
gave illegal notes
I am Mehra, -I am
called Hazari Prasad
I have not seen you before
in this town. Are you new here?
I belong here. But for business,
we have to leave our country
By the way, what is your
business?
Not much, 4 textile mills, some
shipping corpn. & some industry.
All small-small businesses.
-Small! You joke very well.
What are you doing today
evening?-Nothing,
Let us have a drink
-Let us meet and mix
Long live our friendship
-ln the name of our friendship
Why has'nt Mr. Mehra come
yet?-He is usually very punctual
Comes daily at 9..00.
Don't know why he is late
Remember the dialogues- Yes
-Let us start
What do you think of yourself?
You think I am a greedy fraud?
What is the matter?
Why are you upset?
Mr. Mehra, I had told Panditji
to get me a daughter-in-law...
...of good virtues even if she
is only with oneset of clothes
But he is bringing alliances of
millionaires and billionaires...
...who want to buy my son.
Money can't give good virtues
If you don't mind, shall l
tell something?
Definitely, that is your right.
I know a girl who has virtues
you want in a daughter-in-law
Tell me where she is, I will
be grateful to you lifelong.
My Daughter!
Yours?
Why are you quiet?
Tell your opinion frankly,
there is no binding at all.
Mr. Mehra, from today,
our friendship is finished
As we are going
to become close relations now
You joke well-This is fate,
girl is inside the house...
...but we are searching the
whole city.
Match the horoscopes fast,
if they match, you will get...
...everything, understood?-Sir,
give your daughter's horoscope
I don't have that?- Then
tell her birth date & time
I remember that. On 8th January,
1981, it used to dew.
The horoscopes matched well
congratulations to both of you
There are 64 matches. Like this
only Ram-Sita's and...
... Shiv-Parvati's horoscope
matched.
Like that Raja's & Madhu's
horoscopes have matched
What do you think of yourself?
A lone one
You laugh at others, if you
are a man, dance with me
I have told you before, l
don't mix with girls
Only if you are a man,
you will do that
Please come
Mr. Mehra will just come
Dad, where have you brought me
-I have convinced this...
...man with great difficulty-How
will I marry an unknown girl?
I also married like that, you will
also do the same & shut up
Then I will shout.
-My dear son!
What a scene, father and
son's affection is great
I felt like hugging my son
This is my mother
-He is my son Raja
Where is your daughter?
-Took the dog for a walk
Hello Daddy- come
This is Hazari Prasad,
your would-be father-in-law
This is his son, Raja
- Son...
Você?
You know each other?
Dad you want me to marry this
rowdy. Not even worth my dog
I will marry this dog, but not
you, I can't marry this witch
I am a witch-Since you know
each other, there is no problem
Congrats- Shut up- Don't tell my
dad to shut up
Madhu, what are you doing?
-Grandma, he is a big rowdy
Yes, you are very innocent!
-What are you doing, son?
Why you are spoiling all my
plans? For god's sake keep quiet
Dad, I will see to this lizard
-You called me a lizard.
Dad, you move! You cockroach
You did this to my dad?
I will not leave you
- Look, dad. Cake for cake
You did this to my dad?
You bloody rascal!
I will see to you lizard
-I will not leave him
I am going now, I can't
wait even for a moment here.
I will die, my end is near and
my son is responsible for that
Control yourself, or your
condition will worsen
What is there to worsen now?
Lift this moutain a little
Crores are lost. He kicked the
Lakshmi (wealth). Useless son.
I will not leave my son. I will
bury him alive. Where is he?
There he is, I will kill him
-What are you doing?
No need to kill me. You will get
death penalty then.
For your happiness, I will
myself commit suicide
This knife has cut lot of things
but today I will be cut.
What are you doing, son?
-Let me die, mother
Whom are you threatening,
die now?
Are father and son like this?
-ls he a son- Is he a father?
You have to marry that girl
-I will not marry that witch
Your dad will also do that
-Than do that?
Are you mad, if our young son
does anything, we will be bereft
I will not accept defeat so
easily. You will wed that girl
Don't feel bad, Hazari, nowadays
young men don't listen to parents
We should not compel our
children
Call your daughter, she might
listen to me
My daughter is going on a tour
to Ooty with friends tomorrow
We will talk, when she comes.
Asha, you know, one came to my
house with a wish to marry me
What happened, then?-He was
rejected even by my dog.
His head was hit by sandals so
much that, his children will...
...also be born bald
Cover this camera properly
-Bring my things, please
I will just go to the loo
I will also just come
The girl was young, had
to go to Japan, went to China
So Angry she was. She will
remember U always in toilet.
Your room has come, Raja
-Good night
Save me!
-Who is that?
Leave me for God's sake
He forcefully entered my room
and tried to rape me, sir
If you had not come,
I can't imagine my condition
Sir, I did'nt do anything, ask her
what she is doing in my room
Stop this nonsense, this is room
no.6, see properly
Sir, this is her game,
she is lying
Get lost from here. Don't show
me your black face again.
You all go to your rooms
You blamed that
I tried to rape you
I will teach you that today.
Beware, don't try to
touch me.
Beware, stop, don't come forward.
Is there anyone? Save!
Please let me go and
forgive me.
This is a matter of my prestige.
Please forgive me.
Please forgive me
and let me go
Understand what is rape?
Those ladies who go through...
...this rape, their body as well
as soul is hurt.
And you easily blamed me for
rape, which was just a word...
...for you, but it has spoiled
my whole life.
I have fallen before people's eye.
You have destroyed my prestige...
...respect. But I can't do that.
But cannot play with their
prestige
Go away from here
Remember one thing. Do not
repeat this mistake again.
As every boy may not be Raja.
You did'nt do right. This could
have destroyed Raja's life
The climate here is so nice.
Don't feel like going back.
What happened Madhu?- Looks,
as if I sprained my leg
It is paining a lot.
Not with so much force
What happened to her,
now only she was shouting
- Nothing
-What is written?
Looks the whole night will
go dancing only.
Divya, tell Raja to come & meet
me in the lawn behind the hotel
Raja, Madhu wants to speak
to you
Tell her, I don't want to meet her
Raja refused, I am sorry
I am not getting any sleep
I am not getting any peace.
I am not getting any sleep
I am not getting any peace.
Please somebody go and
search for my heart.
Don't know where my heart
is lost
I am not getting any sleep
I am not getting any peace.
Please somebody go and
search for my heart.
Don't know where my
heart is lost
How do I tell my
condition to you?
I keep changing sides and
spend the night
How do I tell my
condition to you?
I keep changing sides and
spend the night
Please ask me what
is my condition.
My condition is very bad
Nobody is able to understand
or stop that.
Don't know where l
have lost my heart?
Don't know where I have
lost my heart?
My heart is more dear to
me than my life
It is difficult to live even
one moment without my heart.
My heart is more dear to
me than my life
It is difficult to live even
one moment without my heart.
What is this pain?
This pain is heartless.
Sometimes it makes me laugh
and sometimes makes me cry
Somebody go and search
for it
I don't know, where l
have lost my heart
I am not getting any sleep
I am not getting any peace.
I am not getting any sleep
I am not getting any peace.
Please somebody go and
search for my heart.
Don't know where my
heart is lost
Why have you come inside
-Telegram, sir
Definitely you must have
brought some bad news.
You did'nt give for Diwali this time
-Here I am broken...
...you talk about Diwali.
Give me that.
Lord, please take care of
me. Don't give me any bad news
What happened?
Madam, come fast, he is panting?
What happened to you?
Either my name is not Hazari,
or I have no son named Raja
Somebody has played a bad
joke on me.
It is not a joke. It is nice that
Raja & Madhu want to marry
Read again properly-Raja
& Madhu want to marry.
Mr. Mehra- What happened
Hazari Prasad?
The 8th wonder of the
world has happened
The water has caught fire,
fish on trees etc.
Raja & Madhu have accepted
to marry each other
