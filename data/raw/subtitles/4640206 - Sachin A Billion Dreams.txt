Today, you can't talk to Anjali
because she just had an operation.
I will come and show you the baby.
- Look at that.
My goodness..
You're going to be
a cricketer like your father?
Father's so shy, he's not looking up.
Yes.. I am scared.
- The father's so scared.
I'm concentrating very hard.
As far as I can remember
I always wanted to be like my father.
Shall we go to Goa? Goa?
He always told me that,
Whatever you want to be in life
always give your best
and never take shortcuts.
So unaware of what everybody's doing.
Nice face..
You've chosen to play cricket and
that is just one chapter of your life.
But something that's going
to stay permanently with you
is the person that you are.
If people tell me that
you are a better person than a cricketer
then I would be a happier father.
India.. India!
What is India?
India!
India is not a country.
A thousand Indias dwell within this India.
At the stroke of the midnight hour
India will awake to life and freedom!
In a country, where there's
such widespread poverty still
unless it is dealt with,
no system will prevail.
The story of India over the last 25-30 years
is of a nation
on the path of self-realization.
The nation was searching for a hero
who would be the best in the world.
The one sphere where
India comes real, is sport.
Between 1989 and 2013
we've had ten governments.
The television revolution has happened.
Amidst all this chaos
there is one order.
Sachin.. Sachin..
Sachin.. Sachin..
Sachin.. Sachin..
Perhaps, there's no other player
who has had such a long stint
and no other player
who has disappointed people so less.
Sachin.. Sachin..
Sachin.. Sachin..
Sachin.. Sachin..
For India, Sachin is not just an icon
he is much more than that.
He is an emotion.
Sachin.. Sachin..
Sachin.. Sachin..
Sachin.. Sachin..
Sachin.. Sachin..
First nation..
A crowd of a 100,000 turned out
for this first rally.
Showed encouragement..
And it has been..
Hey, this is the.. Shall we?
That is probably the biggest test yet.
Wow! Fritters! Sweets!
Hey! Did you wash your hands?
- I did, five times.
Five times? I see!
Gaurav!
Hey, Gaurav!
Look there. A two rupee note!
- What?
Look there.
Three steps to your left.
What happened, dear?
Are you alright?
I told him to be careful,
otherwise he'd fall into the pit.
But he didn't listen.
When did you warn him?
We didn't hear anything!
I come from a very simple,
middle-class family.
My father was a Marathi professor
a writer and a poet too.
Colors are lost in the sky.
Colors are lost in the sky.
Colors are spread in my eyes.
"Had this heart not been helpless.."
We siblings are very close to each other.
"Any my paths are lonely.."
"I wish I had a pretty companion."
Music was very important to our family.
"Oh.. This heart.."
That's why I was named..
Sachin!
Sachin.. Sachin!
He was very mischievous.
Children are very mischievous.
He had eaten his lunch
and hid a frog in the empty lunchbox.
It was a prank for him
and I had no clue.
So, when I opened the box, I saw a frog
and it immediately jumped out.
I inherited my industrious nature
from my mother.
She would work day and night
and never tire.
Sachin!
- But I would never listen to her.
Sachin!
But whenever my brother, Nitin,
would call me..
Sachin!
...I would immediately run back home.
Because I was scared of him.
He would run around
like he was on roller-skates.
He was never indoors.
Always on the ground.
Hey..
Always wash before eating!
Sachin would sometimes
eat outside on the ground.
He was full of energy..
A bundle of energy.
I played a lot of pranks.
The naughtiest thing that I did
was when we would deflate
all four tires of the car.
Whoever has done this,
show up himself right now!
That was very naughty.
I wouldn't want anyone to do that to my car!
These neighborhood kids are very annoying!
Father.
Looks nice on you.
I remember my sister, Savita
bringing gifts for everyone
from her trip to Kashmir.
And for me?
Close your eyes.
Done?
Now open.
I bought a small gift for Sachin
just to play with.
Right hand on the base
and loosen your left hand.
And hit the ball.
Got it? Come on.
Sachin!
It's on. Hurry up.
Come on! Let's go.
I was only ten years old
when India won the World Cup in 1983.
We don't have a chance.
Look at their team.
Holding, Robert, Garner..
And our team?
The edge just picking up..
Howzzat..
- Yay!
I didn't know the significance
of being world champions.
But I felt differently.
There was a buzz in the air.
And from there on,
this beautiful journey started.
I wanted to play for India, some day.
I wanted to hold the World Cup in my hands,
and win the Cup for India.
The person who understood me the best
and guided me always, was my brother, Ajit.
Ajit was the first
to notice the talent in me..
That spark.
He took me to Mr. Ramakant Achrekar.
Feels nice to be back here
at Shivaji Park again.
Brings back all the wonderful memories.
This net is where for the first time
I tried on pads, gloves,
thigh guard and all, and batted.
The main reason for taking Sachin
to Mr. Achrekar was that
he was the coach
for Shardashram School
which was a champion team.
I was very tense and nervous.
I had no clue about what was going on.
The seasoned ball bounces differently
and the rubber ball,
obviously has more bounce.
It comes directly on to the bat,
so you can hit it better.
But I was getting a feel that
this ball was keeping slightly low.
So I couldn't do much with it.
He must be feeling intimidated
because you're watching.
If you stop looking at him
he'll loosen up and start playing.
He plays really well.
So, this time when I looked back
I saw that Mr. Achrekar
wasn't standing there anymore.
He had taken charge of another net.
What did you say your brother's name was?
<I>Sachin Tendulkar!</I>
<I>What a player!</I>
<I>What a wonderful player!</I>
"Brave Maratha.."
It was a demanding routine.
Waking up at 6 a.m.
Going to school.
Reaching the ground at 3 p.m.
And then until dusk,
just practice, practice, practice!
"Let the knees wear off."
"Let the heels wear off."
"Color yourself with the hues of passion."
"Hammer it to the skies."
"Take it head on."
"Just like the wind.."
Mr. Achrekar would take him
from one ground to another.
Owing to which, Sachin would end up playing
two different matches on the same day.
There were times when Sachin
played for ten consecutive days.
The days spent in Shivaji Park
were very special.
Mr. Achrekar taught me
to play honestly and with dedication.
And never to cheat.
No player is bigger than the team.
This piece of advice
became a part of my kitbag.
It helped me face the world.
Whoever claims his wicket will get this coin.
There would be at least
80 fielders around the park
so it was important
to keep the ball on the ground.
I won many coins.
These are like gold medals for me.
Whenever I batted well
sir would give me
money to buy Vada-Pav.
And I would know
that sir was happy with me that day.
In fact, my breakfast was that!
After many years, these guys were
wanting to serve me Muesli and all.
I said, No.. Please keep all that aside.
I need "Vada-Pav".
Ticket.
Hey, wise-guy,
who's going to buy a ticket for your bag?
Sunil Gavaskar or Kapil Dev?
Sachin!
"Tire out if you have to."
"Rest if you have to."
"But get back up soon."
I never had time for myself.
So my parents and brother decided
that I would go and stay
with my uncle and aunt
who lived at a stone's throw away
from the ground.
"Hammer it to the skies.
Take them head on."
After coming back from practice,
he would first eat
and then I would bowl to him.
I would get tired,
but he would never get tired.
And he would say,
Throw the ball and get me out.
But how would one get him out?
That's how I learnt my back foot defense.
It would remind me of Formula One race.
As soon as Sachin would come home
he would sleep in mother's lap
and father would massage his feet
while aunt would feed him.
This is where my career
took direction and shape.
It changed me as a person, completely.
From a notorious kid
to a serious and focused cricketer.
I scored the highest partnership
with Vinod Kambli
which was also a world-record at that time.
They are still batting, sir.
The bowlers are crying!
They don't want to bowl to them.
"Don't give up.."
"Here comes the brave Maratha.."
In just five matches
of inter-school cricket, he'd made 1028 runs.
He'd been out only once.
So Sachin Tendulkar was already
a well-known name
in Mumbai's cricketing circles.
Top cricketers would come
to see Sachin batting.
Even at the age of 14-15 years
one could see that here's a young player
who would bring fame to India,
as well as for himself, in future.
Sachin, you must be getting tired now
of people asking you questions,
and giving interviews a lot.
No.. I think this is just the start.
You prefer facing fast bowlers?
- Yeah, I always prefer.
What is the reason for that?
- Fast bowlers..
I like to play fast bowlers
because the ball comes straight on the bat.
At the CCI Nets,
I think Kapil also bowled to you.
How was that?
- I enjoyed.
I just kept on playing.
<I>16 year-old Sachin Tendulkar,
child prodigy.</I>
<I>The youngest ever cricketer
to play for his country.</I>
<I>At 14, he was the
youngest ever cricketer</I>
<I>to play for the Ranji Trophy, which
included a century in his debut match.</I>
Once in a decade, a genius is born
and Sachin Tendulkar is just that.
I am very proud to say that
I've been selected for the Indian Team.
And tomorrow we'll be going to Pakistan.
Do you feel a little nervous
about facing the Pakistan team?
No, not at all.
India-Pakistan cricket match
is the world's biggest sporting rivalry.
I remember that India won one World Cup match
and there was celebratory gunfire
by the soldiers at the border.
It's an emotion that perhaps,
no other country can understand.
<I>As the new dominions of Pakistan
and India take over their own affairs</I>
<I>fleeing from their looted,
blood-stained towns, comes a new exodus..</I>
Overnight, the country had a partition.
It was one of the most violent
mass migrations in history.
Unlike anything seen
anywhere else in the world.
Whether it's cinema, culture or sport
India versus Pakistan gets imbued
with a different kind of significance.
And cricket is the only arena
where the two square off against each other.
You don't want them
to square off anywhere else
especially if the alternative is the armies.
Long live India!
In 1989, the conflict in Kashmir
was just about to start.
At that point in time,
for a 16 year-old Indian to go to Pakistan
and play the likes of
Imran, Wasim and Waqar
is unbelievable!
The first time we saw him on Karachi Grounds
during practice
he looked about 14.
I looked at Waqar,
and Waqar looked back at me.
And we said,
What's this kid going to do?
Why have they got him here?
<I>And the next batsman..
Looks to me to be Tendulkar.</I>
<I>And if one can say he's having
a baptism of fire, this is it.</I>
<I>Coming to a situation where
India are reeling</I>
<I>and the Pakistan pace attack
looking almost invincible.</I>
Our bowlers bowled at 150 kmph,
with swing.
<I>Akram to Tendulkar.
It's quite a terrifying site.</I>
The first ball to him was a bouncer,
and we said to him
Welcome, boy, to Test cricket.
This is not school cricket.
The only drive you'll get here
is from the hotel to the ground.
<I>This one a very airy-fairy shot
from Tendulkar.</I>
<I>Bowled!</I>
I had no clue
as to what was happening over there.
I thought that maybe
I would never get another opportunity.
After that Sachin's body language
looked pretty negative.
He dropped his shoulders down
and he looked very upset.
So the next day, I went to Pakistan.
I remember him coming to me
and asking in Marathi
I played in a hurry, didn't I?
So I told him
that he must give himself some time
at this level
and just respect the conditions.
Hey, out..
For quite some time, my coach
hadn't allowed me to wear a helmet.
He said, You got to see the ball
and if you get hit,
then learn to take the hit.
We were in a delicate situation.
Wasim-Waqar were bowling flat out.
Full throttle.
Waqar Younis to Tendulkar.
Testing him with a bouncer.
When a seasoned ball hits you..
It was a gory sight.
His nose was totally smashed out of place.
The entire Pakistan team gathered around me.
And Javed Miandad said
Your nose is broken.
You have to leave right
away to the hospital.
By the time I reached the non-striker's end
I hear a squeaky voice..
I'll play.
I'll play.
Had I walked out, it would have been
a huge benefit to Pakistan.
My brother, Ajit, was sitting right
in front of the dressing room.
I didn't want to let him or my country down.
I wiped away the blood, applied a bit of ice
and continued batting.
I knew the next delivery
was going to be a yorker.
He was standing two feet behind.
In that state of mind, he anticipated.
<I>That's a good shot.
That's four runs.</I>
<I>That must do him a world of good.</I>
He didn't bat an eyelid after that.
He was like a guy who has
already played 15-20 test matches.
Bones will break
but that won't stop me
from doing what I want.
That's when we Pakistanis
got impressed with this little chap.
I made 57 runs
and the satisfaction for having saved
the game for India was unbelievable.
I became fearless after that.
Just two days later
Sachin was facing Abdul Qadir,
the best spinner in the world.
When Qadir had just bowled,
he said something to you.
He told me that..
I won't let you hit it.
He said that?
- Yes, he said that.
I said, How can I hit you?
You are such a good bowler.
I think, thanks to the grace of Allah
not many have hit me for a six too often.
In fact, I had bowled to him
with my full ability.
53 runs in 18 balls.
It was a declaration.
A legend was born.
<I>And a new star in
international cricket..</I>
<I>India today successfully
launched a long-range missile.</I>
You can visualize India through
the prism of Sachin Tendulkar.
<I>Tendulkar on 98.</I>
<I>And there it is..</I>
<I>First Test Match 100 for Tendulkar
aged 17 years.</I>
<I>India's former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated today.</I>
If you come from a nation
that has a lot of sadness
you look for inspiring stories around
to forget all the negativity.
<I>That's 50.</I>
<I>Beautiful 50 from this young man.</I>
<I>A star of the future.</I>
Until 1991, we were an economy
that was a closed one.
We are on the verge of a collapse.
Time to think big.
<I>There's a chance he'll get it.
Uses it to come back..</I>
We were standing
at the threshold of history.
The possibilities of the future
was clearly evident.
<I>Here's the youngest player
to score a test 100 in Australia.</I>
"If there is love.."
<I>His second 100 in the series,
and certainly the best.</I>
Tendulkar's achievements overseas proved that
India is as good as any other team anywhere.
Can you see any specific area
you might ever go getting him out?
I think our best chance
is when he's not looking!
<I>128 years of cricket tradition
were broken today</I>
<I>when the Indian batsman, Sachin Tendulkar,
made his debut for Yorkshire.</I>
He's a fine young player,
he's going to get better.
In those days, Doordarshan,
the state broadcaster
would demand Rs. 5 lakh from the BCCI
to telecast a cricket match.
In 1993, for the first time
the Indian Cricket Board
sold the telecast rights to ESPN
for 6,50,000 dollars.
And so began a deluge of money.
The person at the center of this
telecast revolution and liberalization story
was Sachin.
He became the poster boy of the country,
overnight.
Boost is the secret of my energy.
Our energy.
With the young Sachin,
there was a great desire to love him.
He represented the traditional
middle class virtues.
Humility, modesty
respecting elders
not chasing money..
Tendulkar chased runs
and everything else came to him, naturally.
<I>Like being famous?</I>
Not very much, but like to be famous.
Till now I've not become a great batsman.
But no one can tell his future.
Gavaskar's generation
invested in fixed bank deposits.
Whereas Sachin's generation
was ready to play the equity markets.
And that was quite evident in his batting.
You've just got engaged
to be married, haven't you?
Yeah, I got engaged the other day
when we got back from Sharjah.
Were you embarrassed
when you popped the question?
No, no.. Not really.
In 1990, Sachin was returning after playing
his first tour in England.
In those days, the Mumbai airport
had a viewing gallery.
And I had gone to the airport with a friend
to pick up my mom.
There were many people
standing downstairs
wearing blazers.
I found one of them very cute.
I was looking down
and suddenly I saw him look up at me.
And I thought he's like
the cutest person
I have ever seen in my life.
My friend, Aparna, said
Hey, he is Sachin Tendulkar!
And he is the youngest Indian
to have scored a Test century.
I ran down from there
and I was just screaming his name
as I ran after him.
I didn't have the courage
to wave at her and look back.
I just looked down
pushed my trolley and left.
The next day,
every single newspaper had a photo of him.
I got every single picture, cut it out
and stuck them in all my textbooks.
So, whichever textbook I opened
the first thing I would see
was this picture of Sachin.
My friend got me his number,
I called Sachin and said
I saw you at the airport yesterday.
He said that he remembered.
So, just to confirm,
I asked him what I was wearing.
I said, it was orange or red t-shirt
and blue jeans.
So, she was impressed that I remembered her.
I said, she was the only girl
who was waving and screaming out there.
How could I have not noticed her?
I had never done this in my life.
I was a very serious medical student.
But there was something special about him.
Anjali was the first girl
whom I had spoken to like that on the phone.
We met.
We got to know each other
and then I started dating her.
It had been four years
since we started seeing each other.
Sachin had recently returned
from his New Zealand tour
where he had opened the innings
for the first time.
And when he came back
he was extremely happy.
So I asked,
What are your plans about us?
I said that we should get engaged
and that I was too shy
to speak to my family about this.
That she will have to talk to them.
I was fine with that.
So I went to his house.
I met his parents
and told them that Sachin wanted to marry me.
And they agreed.
"I love these things."
"What?
- This land.."
"These rivers.."
"This ambience.. And you!
- And?"
"I love these things."
"This land, these rivers, this ambiance.."
"And?
- And you!"
"I love these things."
Anjali was the one who decided
to step back from her career.
Because she knew that I was playing for India
and every little thing that I did,
the whole nation was following it.
What are you doing?
Please don't.
Don't be conscious.
He sort of made it clear
that one of us has to give up their career.
That's when I decided
I was not going to pursue
my career in medicine
even though I was an MD in Pediatrics.
Stand straight.
For me, it was extremely important
to have a life-partner who understood
the immense pressure on me
and understood my dreams.
The 1996 World Cup was a foretaste
of what international cricket
is going to look like
because the world comes to India
rather than India needing
to go to the world.
In the opening game of Group A,
India however..
It was huge
because everyone felt that maybe
India playing at home
could repeat the glory of 1983.
Sachin Tendulkar..
What a player! Beautifully played!
Sachin Tendulkar is on fire.
Unbelievable batting.
The crowd loving every minute..
He has come down the track.
And the ball goes soaring over
mid-on for a six.
We will win!
Pakistan's going to win!
India-Pakistan match is always special.
Aamer Sohail hit Venkatesh Prasad for a four
and said something to him.
And on the next ball..
And Venkatesh gave him
a rather special send-off.
You know that the next day
after a game against Pakistan
you're going to wake-up with a sore throat.
Out!
India beats Pakistan to get
through to the Semi-Finals.
It almost seemed as though
this is bound to be their year
in front of their fans.
Eden Gardens, Kolkata.
The crowds have been pouring in
since very early this morning.
The atmosphere is
absolutely electrifying.
Those 252 runs required
aren't going to be easy to get.
The whole nation is transfixed.
And everything rides on Tendulkar's fortunes.
Can you imagine the pressure
on a 22-year-old?
That was the first World Cup
Semi-Final match of my life.
It was expected that I make a big score
and do something special.
That's a beautiful straight drive.
And Tendulkar..
Driven beautifully through the off-side
by Sachin Tendulkar.
Every four that he hit gave a sense
of enveloping national destiny.
Sachin Tendulkar on 49.
Listen to the crowd.
The crowd says it all.
Really beautiful innings
and we love you, Tendulkar.
Oh, he's got him!
Yes, he's got him!
I am sure he's out.
This could be a vital wicket.
He's asked for the replay.
Tendulkar knows he's
in big trouble here.
Wonderful,
smart work by the wicket keeper.
I knew that I was out.
Before I could turn back
and get inside the crease
Kaluwitharana had taken the bails off.
Oh, he's gone.
People didn't quite know what to do.
There was just this
incredible sense of disbelief.
Take it! - In the air, and he's got him.
He is out caught and bowled!
Bowled! - He has bowled him.
Around his legs again.
India played themselves into a situation
that was not uncommon in those days.
If Tendulkar is out, India is out.
He's got that in the air.
The Indians are committing suicide.
And it pretty soon became clear
that this is not going to be India's night.
This is not going to be India's tournament.
India wasn't destined to win this game.
And the crowd made it worse.
All the hopes and dreams
of the Indian people
have all gone up in smoke.
Well, it looks to me like
they are coming off the ground.
The game is going to have to be
awarded to the Sri Lankans.
I had never seen such disappointment
in the dressing room.
It was too embarrassing.
Everything was over, even my dream.
Selection committee felt that
there was a need for change.
Tendulkar has been
selected as the captain.
Hi.
How do you feel about it?
Yes, I feel good.
I'm quite happy about it.
The first Test, I was excited,
all charged up.
As a captain when you win,
it's an amazing feeling.
When your plans click,
it gives you immense satisfaction.
But when it doesn't
you can't sleep at night.
You keep wondering where you went wrong.
Whenever we lost, it affected me.
And slowly, I started feeling that pressure.
And it is caught by Gary Kirsten.
Pollock has got Sachin Tendulkar.
People started saying
that captaincy is adversely
affecting my batting.
He would just stop talking.
I would think maybe he's upset with me
over something.
I would ask him if he was angry with me.
I figured out eventually
that it has nothing to do with me.
It's just that his mind
is completely in his game.
As a sportsman, you have to learn
to get back on your feet after a defeat
and start competing again.
But I was finding it difficult
to get over this disappointment
as I was taking it personally.
When the team wouldn't perform well
he'd be so disturbed.
He wouldn't sleep at night.
He would only be thinking
about setting fields, or planning..
That is all he would do at night.
He used to tell me
that something's not right.
And the matches that they were losing
should actually have been won.
I was only 23 when I became the captain.
Perhaps that's why it wasn't easy
for the senior players to play for me.
Azhar had led from 1990.
Of course, I have a lot of respect for him.
And I'm sure he'll listen to me
and there won't be any ego problems at all.
On one hand was Mohammad Azharuddin..
Stylish, classical, very handsome batsman.
And on the other hand was this emerging star,
the mega star, Sachin Tendulkar.
There was bound to be some
unrest in the dressing room.
Mohammad Azharuddin
was also a cricketer of great eminence
but here was this boy
who had become the nation's darling
taking everything away from him.
There were two different
emerging power centers
and that was clearly visible.
Day 4 of the third Test Match.
India requiring 118 runs to win.
Big challenge here for Brian Lara
in his first Test as captain.
Here's Franklin Rose.
How do you play that?
That's out.
Well, the match may
well hinge around this man.
Edged and taken by Lara.
This is a big blow for India.
He told me once
that this was the lowest point
of his cricketing career so far.
Especially because somewhere he felt
that not everyone was playing as a team.
That's it.
The third test match is over
and won in dramatic style.
Tendulkar has been
removed as a captain
to relieve the tension on his mind
as a captain
and to take the best
out of him as a player.
I felt terrible
because no one had the courtesy
to even call me up and tell me.
I know I've not been able
to live up to my own expectations.
But every batsman has to go through that.
So I don't think because of captaincy
there is any pressure on my batting.
No, I don't feel there's
a burden on me as such.
When life starts getting difficult
you need your family members
around you even more.
Dad..
"Happy birthday to you!"
"Happy birthday, dear Sara."
"Happy birthday to you!"
I did everything possible
to keep him relaxed.
I would never bother him
with any problems at home.
Cricket was his priority,
the family came later.
And we had accepted this fact.
Whenever I felt troubled
over cricketing matters
I would always seek
my brother, Ajit's advice.
Since the day Sachin started playing cricket
there hasn't been a single day
that I didn't talk to him about cricket.
Or spoke about anything else besides cricket.
Ajit and I would constantly
be in touch with each other.
I would go out alone to bat
but I knew that
he was always with me, mentally.
It seemed like we both played the game,
not just me.
They could take away the captaincy from me
but not cricket.
Cricket is like oxygen to me.
Without it, I am nothing!
For the last 25 years,
this has been my companion.
My kitbag.
My children, Sara and Arjun,
drew this Indian flag for me.
All these are very important for me.
I'm a bit fussy about my kit.
I wanted everything to be perfect.
This is the padding that I've created myself.
I've taken different pieces of cushion
and put these little pieces together
to make one big package.
When you're batting,
the last two fingers become important.
I've fixed more protection on the right hand.
And attached a fiber plate
over here on the top.
So it is less painful.
People kept discussing the weight of my bat.
I never believed that the weight of my bat
has to be changed.
For me, the bat was a part of my body.
So why change it?
Only the shape of the bat was changed.
It is a little curvy at the end.
And I always liked this curve.
If somebody cracked their bat
they would ask me to repair it.
I would always keep
glue, tapes, sandpaper
and batting grips in this bag
I'd repair the bat overnight
and return it to them.
I've always respected the bat.
I never threw my bat, ever.
My coach would always say
You must learn to look after your kit
and the kit will look after you
in the ground.
With Sachin Tendulkar
facing criticism over his form
a nail-biting encounter
between India and Australia
could well be on the cards.
The Australians have
great depth in their batting
not to speak of the Golden Arm
of Shane Warne.
Excellently brilliant
from Shane Warne.
He can bring things in the air
out of nowhere.
Warne's specialty was
that he used to drift the ball
and it would go in the air outside
the leg stump and turn in.
Warne, you having a good time?
- I am!
In the 1998 tour of India, there was
nothing about Australia versus India.
It was always Warne versus Tendulkar.
I used to prepare for the conditions.
Not for any individual bowler.
But the only person
I've prepared myself for, is Warne.
Because until then
there was no right-handed bowler
who would go round the wicket
and bowl into the rough.
I heard that he'd practiced with
roughing up pitches around the wicket.
And getting young leg spinners
to bowl at him.
There are different things one has to do
to play against world-class bowlers.
I'll just tell Shane Warne.
He's developing a secret weapon.
Welcome to the series
that we've all been looking forward to.
To the Chidambaram
Stadium here in Chennai.
It's hot,
humid and steamy all over again.
This is what the
crowd has come to see.
Two tremendous young players here
pitted against each other.
Sachin! Sachin!
Our plans for Sachin, earlier,
were to try and go after him.
Intimidate him, verbally.
Short leg wicket..
He's out and Mark Taylor has taken
a splendid reflex axiom catch
actually..
When you get out like this
you want to go the dressing room
and slap yourself real hard.
He was so dejected,
he just went into the room
and locked himself away for almost two hours.
We'll have to see if Sachin Tendulkar
has got his skip back in the 2nd innings.
For me, the game is all about
getting into your opponent's head.
If I am stuck with my technique
how am I going to watch the bowler?
From the opposite end, the bowler
constantly asks you questions.
I knew that Warne hadn't used
his round wicket technique yet.
At a crunch moment in the Test series
he came round the wicket to me.
I always felt that I should have
more than one method.
First, how to hit the pad
and make the ball a dead one.
And second, how I should attack if I wish to.
"When he hits the six"
"there is no way you can catch it."
"You can be.."
He also put pressure on me then.
And all of the rest of the bowlers to think
Well, if he can do that,
what else has he got?
If someone's generally getting on top of you
you seem to think,
Well, he can't just keep doing that.
He did do it.
After that innings, he graciously
came up to me and congratulated.
And from then on, we became good friends.
Went over to his place a few times.
Dinner would start at about 12 o'clock.
And I'm sort of saying,
I'm ready for a skip
as I got to bowl tomorrow.
I don't know if it was a strategy or not
but it was good fun.
He loved Dire Straits
and he had this fantastic sound system.
Music has always been my secret weapon.
"You get a shiver in the dark,
it's raining in the park but meantime.."
To control my emotions
there were many times
I would listen to a single track
over and over throughout the day.
In 1998, he just kicked out the jams
went to a new level
and he showed what he is capable of.
I never saw myself play
but I feel that this fellow is playing
much the same as I used to play.
Century number 13 for Sachin Tendulkar.
What a privilege it's been to be here
while he was batting.
You can ask anyone from that generation
about which was Tendulkar's best innings.
And they will all say..
There's a desert storm brewing here.
We'll have to look at
Tendulkar's approach from now on.
This man is literally toying with
the Australian bowling at the moment.
He was hitting Kasprowicz out of the park.
Shane Warne coming in, going out.
He's gone berserk here in Sharjah.
So has the crowd.
The way he batted on TV
I used to copy his ways at home.
The way he shook his neck
or the way he stood
or delivering a back-foot punch like him.
Wonderful 100 from Sachin Tendulkar.
He has taken India
single-handedly into the finals.
I would tell people, you know
when Sachin comes in to bat,
please let me know.
When he came in to bat,
we would stop working.
Wait, we'll do it later.
We won't get to see this again.
I used to have a fixed position
in front of the TV
and I would not move.
I'd not eat or drink
while he was batting.
Sara, who's come?
What's the score?
Okay, so many runs
for so many wickets..
Is Sachin still batting or not?
That used to be our question.
That would give us some reassurance.
Oh, he has hit this one miles!
I used to try and copy him.
Like hitting fast bowlers for a six
with a straight bat
without follow through.
What a shot!
What a six!
Back then, it was like.. What is this?
We've never seen anything like this.
India have won the..
Mark Mascarenhas had asked me
How good a player is Tendulkar?
I'd like to represent him.
He was like one of those American agents.
But he always thought two steps ahead.
He knew how to turn
Sachin Tendulkar into a brand.
Sachin represents what millions
of young Indian kids want to be.
Sachin!
He was the one whom
we were all looking up to
and we were all chasing.
And it wasn't just me, Lara,
Kallis and those guys.
We all wanted to be like Sachin Tendulkar.
Everybody wants to know
what have you been having for breakfast.
- Let it be a secret.
We've no means of entertainment
in our village.
Not even a cinema hall.
For us, entertainment means
only Sachin's batting.
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin! Sachin!
And that innings against Pakistan..
It was one of his best innings of all time.
During the last 30-40 runs,
he couldn't even bend.
Cricket was a platform
that every advertiser could come to
to use a face that was a known face.
In terms of values,
75 percent of the market went to Sachin.
There were a few articles criticizing me
saying that I am chasing money.
Money is important for everyone.
You want your family to be secure
but not at the price of cricket.
- Kiss him..
Nice girl, you know..
Sara, who's come?
- Sweetheart!
Father and daughter
getting ready in the morning.
He used to be away so much
that we would be happy
when he'd come home.
He didn't spend much time with Sara
but whatever time he spent with her,
he was amazing.
Do this, Sara.
Go closer and show your tongue.
He would have lots of energy
and he would play with her the whole day.
Now show four. Four..
- Four..
He said one thing
that he'd never change diapers.
Sara bowling.
Her dad when he scores a 100.
Sara doing her first Rangoli.
I always wanted to create
the same relationship with my children
as I had with my own parents.
I always found my father so calm.
In my younger days,
I would watch him closely.
I was grasping so many things.
He treated each and every person equally.
He respected everyone.
If I could be half as good as my father was
then I'd consider myself
a good human being.
As the Indian Team
left for the World Cup
the hopes of a nation
too went with them.
This was my third World Cup
and England has always been
a special place for Indian Cricket.
India had already won in 1983
and this team was similar to that team.
I was excited about our chances.
Our second game was to be against Zimbabwe.
And at 2 o'clock in the morning,
I heard a knock on the door.
I was surprised when I opened the door.
It was my wife, Anjali.
She came inside the room and said
Sit down,
there's something I want to tell you.
She said my father had passed away.
He had a massive heart attack
and passed away.
The whole journey is a blur for me.
I'd just gone numb.
I can never forget that sight of my mother
sitting in the corner of the room..
Alone!
For the last 20 hours,
she'd been sitting facing the wall.
She had not moved from that spot.
I was extremely close to him.
From there on
my father was not going to be
a part of what would happen in my life.
That one thought was hurting me.
It was difficult to face the reality
that he's no more alive.
Everyone at home felt
that I should go back
and join the team.
So, I somehow managed to take a flight back.
I got back to England
and went straight to the ground.
Every little thing that I thought of him
brought tears to my eyes.
Yes, I am back because of my family
and all the countrymen.
It was my mother who actually told me
that I should go back
and play the World Cup.
And try and get the cup back home.
My wife, my brothers and sisters
and the rest of the family members also..
They are absolutely behind me
and if my father was alive,
he would've wanted the same thing.
So I am back here to play.
Even while batting, I was thinking of him.
I somehow controlled my tears.
Earlier, when I scored 100, I would thank God
but from that day forward,
every time I looked up
I would thank my father too.
I have not forgotten you, my dear.
I remember everything very clearly.
Our bond today with the unknown
is beyond the boundary of the horizon.
My eyes will hide my
silent tears alone
and leave behind for you
the rainbow to own.
Aditi, Sachin speaking.
It's a boy.
Thank you very much.
He looks like you.
- He's smiling.
Sachin has a name.
Decided the name?
- Nick name.
Mini me.
- Mini me!
Our son, Arjun, was born only four months
after Sachin's father passed away.
His family always felt
that Sachin's father has come back.
Arjun is also very much like Sachin's father.
Very sensitive boy, very caring
and loves his family a lot.
And he's very close to Sachin.
Which muscle is this?
- Which?
Glute.
You know, even here you can
stretch well for the glute.
Sachin was very particular
that Arjun should practice well.
Does that make a difference?
- Yes.
Good to go, come on.
That's your target.
Six balls.
See, this is the last one.
It's better.
Slightly better, yes.
It's like this, right?
Pull this back.
- Yes..
Nice ball.
See, without looking here, I said.
Our coach, Mr. Achrekar,
was very loving, very caring
and at the same time, he was very strict.
He must be a student of this game.
He must know what I told him
but afterwards, he has to use his mind.
It's just your mindset, nothing else.
If batting was that easy
then everyone would be a world champion.
Suppose now, the ball pitches here somewhere
then you'll have to turn your front foot.
At that time your head will be above that
and bat will be as straight as possible.
Suppose the ball pitches here somewhere
then don't try and play it here.
Hold your position.
Yes, much better.
I went to Sachin's house one day
and Arjun had scored 100 in a local match.
His first reaction to me was that
I shouldn't praise him.
Because that goes to their head.
That is the Tendulkar ethos.
Four balls, how many runs to win?
- Seven.
I've got a fine leg up, and third man up.
Long-on, deep midwicket, deep square leg.
The rest of the guys in the ring,
saving single.
This one, you win!
If Arjun doesn't succeed as a cricketer
he's going to have to deal with it.
We can't change the fact
of who his father is.
I've gone through so many years of stress
with Sachin, that I've decided
I really can't go through this
all over again.
Dad, leave him.
Leave him.
Okay, you come..
You come on this side.
In 1999, I was asked again to be the captain.
I said,
Please don't recommend my name.
The way I was dropped from the captaincy
I didn't want to experience that again.
And the next day..
Sachin Tendulkar was back this week
as India's cricket captain
nearly two years after he was replaced
by Mohammad Azharuddin.
I could not believe
because I had clearly declined it.
Has Sachin come under considerable pressure
to accept captaincy?
No, I don't think. I think he's been
used to, you know, being captain.
He was the captain
of the Indian team earlier.
He has been captaining
the Mumbai Cricket Team for quite long.
So I don't think that he has come
under pressure.
I don't know from where you get this feeling.
We discussed it.
He was not sure how it would be perceived
if he doesn't accept the captaincy.
Perhaps it would be deduced that
he's thinking about his own performance
and not caring about the country.
Sachin, to the outside world
the feeling is still that
you're a reluctant captain.
That you don't want to be captain, somehow
and you've been almost forced
to become captain.
I had spoken to the selectors earlier.
And I just felt I was not mentally prepared.
What I expect from the players
is 100 percent involvement on the ground.
Some players may not
perform up to the expectations
but that's fine.
As long as they have put in a lot of effort
I'll be very happy with that.
Again, Sachin,
there have been rumors
that you weren't keen to lead the side
while Azharuddin is still playing.
Any truth in that?
I think it's better we just
leave them as rumors.
And you know, stick to the reality.
After being appointed captain the second time
we left for Australia.
It wasn't a great tour at all.
I do not want to offer any excuses
for our poor performance in Australia.
But I, as captain, take
the moral responsibility for our failure.
I feel sorry for not living up
to the expectations of my countrymen.
And I've decided after a lot of thought,
to step down from the captaincy
after the forthcoming two test matches
against South Africa.
Whatever was not in his hand
we had to just go ahead and accept it.
Something didn't feel quite right.
During the entire revelation
of match-fixing..
At the end of it all,
when it actually came out
the man most disillusioned
was Sachin Tendulkar.
The Indian police claim to have evidence
that Hansie Cronje
had agreed to fix the result
of international games.
The cricketing world's
elite got around
the table today to
address a game in crisis.
Scotland Yard is not
releasing any details.
Investigation is taking
an international dimension.
What scares me is just how
far up the line this corruption goes!
What is match-fixing?
You will pre-determine the result of a match
by buying out the services of a few players
who will under-perform.
He's bowled him!
He is bowled him around his legs!
That's a magnificent delivery!
Not just results, but also
the individual performance in the game.
Runs scored off a particular ball
or runs conceded during a particular spell.
There's just no end to the possibilities
to make money
once you start thinking about it.
Every test playing
country in the world is
currently being investigated
for corruption.
Whatever is the truth, it should come out.
It is very important that we must
clean up our own house first.
There's also sufficient evidence
to establish an inquiry of this type
that there was match-fixing.
Who are they?
- All five of them.
Senior players were banned by the BCCI
while they continued
to protest their innocence.
This was the darkest phase of Indian Cricket.
I couldn't believe that
such things were happening.
It was shocking.
People kept saying,
Why hasn't he spoken yet?
How could I say anything
when I knew nothing!
If I had any evidence,
then it would make sense to speak.
When you're playing for your nation
then it's your 100 percent.
Nothing less than 100 percent.
And I believe that such mistakes
should be non-pardonable.
We'll avoid it now.
Stop watching
or listening to matches, altogether.
Now I am really confused
as to which one was real
and which one was fixed.
Earlier we used to worship cricket
but now, we really doubt it.
For me, playing cricket
was like going to a temple.
I always wanted to win.
Never wanted to lose at any cost.
I would call my friends
and discuss all my problems with them.
We knew deep down how hurt
he was with the whole episode.
So we never spoke about it,
knowing how disturbed he already is.
Everyone would be supportive all the time.
They would always make me see
the brighter side of life.
"Give me some sunshine."
"Give me some rain."
"Give me another chance"
"I want to grow up once again."
Sachin is a very simple guy.
He has never changed.
And he doesn't want us to change either.
We're still like we were 25 years ago.
Maybe that's why we're still good friends.
I would always tell Sachin how weird he was.
There was a bottle of Polo, Ralph Lauren.
I said to Sachin, This smells funny.
He had mixed 25 after-shaves in it.
Be it an injury in the nets..
He loves to have a laugh
at the cost of his friends.
He is like a kid, even now.
Hello, my name is Sachin.
We're going to Geneva tomorrow.
Let's drive a little rough.
- Come on!
Rough.
- If you come in the way, bad luck.
Sometimes, when Sachin
is under immense pressure
or he has a good feeling
about a particular day
he keeps playing the same song
over and over again
of Bappi Lahiri.
"I am reminded"
"of your love!"
Sachin is very competitive.
It's hard to beat him
at any sport.
"I am reminded"
"of your love!"
Life is nothing without good friends.
You should have those special friends.
And I am really fortunate to have
the set of friends around me
who I know for sure,
will stand by me in difficult times.
Post the revelations in 2000
Indian Cricket desperately needed someone
to pin their faith on.
This cleanup was much needed./i>
There was action taken
by the authorities
and what you saw, turn of the century.
Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Javagal Srinath
Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble.
These were the people
you could pin your faith on.
And Sachin Tendulkar
was the flag bearer of the faith.
We needed something extraordinary
to get cricket back on track.
That was a very challenging time for us.
If we lost the match
people would say
we didn't try hard enough.
If we played well and won,
they would still say
that the other team
isn't trying hard enough.
All the more reason why we needed
an India versus Australia series.
They have been in tremendous form.
They have won 14-15 test matches in a row
which is a tremendous achievement.
It was our final frontier
if you like, as well.
To go to India and finally break
the drought and win over there
was what we'd been gearing
ourselves for, for so long.
That's it! Australia has
won 16 test matches in a row.
Australia steam-rolled India
in the First Test.
They looked absolutely unassailable.
They powered through the Second Test as well.
He's bowled him.
He's cleaned him up here.
India followed on and it looked like
Indian cricket is on its last legs.
That is when Rahul Dravid
got together with VVS Laxman
and turned the tide
in an absolutely unforgettable
and irrefutable fashion.
There's the hundred.
Laxman's second test hundred.
The way they scored those runs
and played those important spells
their focus seemed incredible.
He's got it through!
That's a fantastic century!
Rahul Dravid!
But that wasn't enough,
we still had to bowl them out.
And again.. Has he hit it?
He has!
While I was attacking
we needed someone to give another
breakthrough from the other end.
Ganguly, the captain,
to talk to Tendulkar..
And the talk should be,
Just one over for you, mate.
Whenever the wicket turned,
we called in Tendulkar to bowl.
When Australians came to bat,
we would want him to bowl to them.
That's a big shout! He's out!
That's hit his back leg.
What will the umpire do? Out!
He's got everything.
If he bowls off-spin,
he'll be probably better than me.
Wrapped on the pad,
the finger has gone up.
I really thought he had
a lot of talent as a leg spinner.
He had bamboozle people.
He had a good wrong one.
He had a good leg break,
he spun the ball.
He has padded that.. He has given it!
He has given it!
Umpire Bansal has given it!
India has won in a tremendous style.
I think that one day took India way past
the bitter events of the previous year
and brought back the great spirit
of the good old days.
Nice shot!
Tendulkar is beginning to stand himself
all over this match.
Tendulkar has gone for the big one
and got off to his hundred in style.
Oh, he has got it away!
This could be it!
That series changed
the Indian team completely.
India have won the test match.
India have won the series.
Everyone started to believe
that we can defeat
the best teams in the world.
Such a performance against Australia
was extremely necessary
to make people change their perspective.
To win their hearts back.
So that we can celebrate cricket again.
A throw and a miss..
They are going to get back for two.
India is home.
Lords is going wild!
India have won the Natwest Series Finals
by two wickets, here at Lords
in one of the most
incredible one-day matches
the country has ever seen.
We had a very good team
going to South Africa.
We were very sure
that we're going to do well.
And hopefully win the tournament.
And fulfill the dream.
We needed some factor that could motivate us
and remind us when we walk out in the
middle of the ground to play for India
of the commitment
and responsibility we carry.
So that's why we started
signing near the flag before every game.
We wrote, I can, We can!
Because it was essential
to keep the team together
and for all of us to give
100 percent on the field.
"Hey, bat.."
The tri-color is always
the motivating factor.
"Hey, bat, get me underway!"
"If you want to play,
then you must be getting on. Hey!"
My preparation would start
15-20 hours before a game.
I would fold my clothes a particular way
putting them in my kitbag
in a specific order.
I would even iron them myself.
I hated anybody wishing me good luck
before I went out to bat.
Often the coaches would come up to me and say
Good luck, do well.
But that was the last thing I wanted to hear.
I would walk off.
He's superstitious. If he scored a century
after drinking green tea
then he'd drink green tea
throughout the series.
Even if Sir Don Bradman came in
and offered him coffee at that time
he would not drink it!
And he'll get it.
A fourth hundred in World Cup cricket
for Sachin Tendulkar.
During that entire World Cup
he never batted a single day at the nets.
I asked, Are you okay with everything?
He said,
Yes, I'm absolutely fine. Don't worry!
He got 600 runs in the tournament!
My mind was always at the bowler's end.
I would intentionally play a few deliveries
in a particular way
to make sure the bowler
bowl the next delivery
exactly where I want him to bowl.
So again the master batsman
reading the bowler's mind.
All set.
We had to come out with some cunning plans
to try and keep Tendulkar quiet.
If Tendulkar's quiet, the nation's quiet.
End of the over, it's 75 for 1.
I don't think there's any point
sledging Tendulkar.
Here's a man who's already got
a billion people in his ears already.
What exactly do you say to Sachin?
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Whenever we went out to bat together
it felt like I'm stepping out
with the king of the jungle.
Everyone's attention would be
only on Tendulkar.
That would make it pretty easy for me
to score runs with him.
He would normally start
at the non-striker's end.
But that day, as he was going out to bat
he felt Wasim Akram might have
too many tricks for a young player like me.
So he said,
You stay here, I'll take the strike.
If we get Sachin Tendulkar,
we would have won the game.
That was the plan.
But I suppose Sachin had a different plan!
After that shot off Wasim,
he felt this was his game.
Shoaib Akhtar, the Rawalpindi Express,
into the attack.
The fastest bowler in the world
up against the best batsman in the world.
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
He goes after that one and it's a six.
That was the first time
I saw Shoaib Akhtar panicked.
50 in 37 balls.
And the way Sachin played,
it's been outstanding.
I've never seen better innings
for a long time.
Me neither.
He used to be so full of confidence
that he would say, This match is mine,
I am going to win it for the team.
Sachin, thank you for
entertaining us today.
Yeah, this has always been
a special game for us.
And it's the fourth World Cup
we've beaten them in a row.
And nothing means more than this to us.
And this is an emphatic win for India.
So, a journey that started
on the 12th of February
has ended up with them being
in the Final of the World Cup.
We were all charged up,
looking forward to the Final.
The biggest game of my life.
Oh, cracking!
That is a biggie.
Just over the top of the guy at square
and just running away
for a boundary to finish proceedings.
So they have got 359 for 2.
I knew it was a Herculean task
to chase those runs.
We wanted to sort of break that target down
and achieve smaller goals.
The question was, can we hit
50 boundaries in 50 overs?
Difficult, but we can.
Now we're left with 250 balls.
Can we score 160 runs in 250 balls?
Yes, we can.
He is off. Sachin Tendulkar.
The crowd has gone berserk here.
Lots of Indian supporters.
It's running away towards the boundary.
Should be four..
And it's four!
I played one pull shot
and the ball took the top edge of the bat
and went right up in the air.
I was praying to God
to make the bowler drop the catch.
It is!
That is the big one they wanted.
Sachin Tendulkar on the first over.
Such catches are rarely dropped.
One in a hundred.
Unfortunately,
none of the other batsmen scored well.
Everyone was trying to play shots
and getting out.
That's in the air, should be taken.
World Cup for Australia.
A comprehensive win here by 125 runs.
And the Man of the Tournament
is Mr. Sachin Tendulkar.
When I got back from South Africa
friends who had come
to receive me asked
Where is the gold bat you won?
I told them I didn't know
what they were talking about.
They said, The Man of the
Tournament trophy that you got.
I had just packed it
and checked the Golden Bat in.
The other trophy meant everything to me
and it was in their dressing room,
not ours.
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"
My body was not in
a great shape at that time.
I was finding it difficult
to keep myself injury-free.
For him, God is very important.
Maybe it's because of the things
that happened in his life.
He started playing international cricket
at the age of 16.
Before his body was even ready for it.
It was either his knee, or groin,
or his back..
The injuries kept coming.
He got a crack in his toe
that will never heal.
Can you imagine playing
international cricket
all your life
without being able
to take weight on your toe?
The toughest injury to deal
with was my tennis elbow injury.
That pain was excruciating.
Even opening the door
or picking up a glass of water
was painful.
Everyone had a different
suggestion about it
and I was prepared to try anything.
Sachin won't be able to play
in the match against Pakistan.
Troubled with tennis elbow
Sachin Tendulkar recently
had a scan done in London.
Are you sticking
to your old, trusted heavy bat?
I am sticking to what
I feel comfortable with
not what people feel comfortable with.
It's all been done in consultation
with the doctors
who have actually examined my injury.
Because there have been
a lot of doctors who have
not even met me
and they know what
is wrong with my elbow.
I really find that funny.
Every time Sachin Tendulkar
got an injury
India got to know a little more
about human anatomy.
No one knew
what a tennis elbow was
until Tendulkar got it.
About 12-year-old kids
would stop the ball 10 yards away from me.
That particular experience
gave me nightmares.
I thought, my career was over.
I would have to tell him
that he had played for many years.
Nobody else had played for so long.
That his body supported him
for so many years
and that he should be positive.
I used to call my friends
and say that I wanted to see them.
I would think, what in the world
was he doing at 4 in the morning!
I would pray to God
that I don't want my career
to end like this.
I wanted another chance.
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"
"Hail Lord Ganesha!"
Come on, guys.
Come on.
A famous father and his son
enjoying a game of cricket.
It was a forced rest
for Sachin Tendulkar
after his tennis elbow surgery.
Nearly three months later,
he began short sessions
with the bat at the nets.
His physiotherapists would give him
fixed programs
like he must play 40 balls in a day.
He would end up playing 140 balls in a day!
He would climb 10 stories
up and down for fitness
so that whenever he recovers
from his elbow injury
he's match fit.
For the average person in Mumbai,
Sachin back at the nets
after tennis elbow injury
means good news for Indian cricket.
Sachin's come through today pretty well.
We just need to see
how he responds to that the next day.
While I was walking out
on the field to bat again
I looked up and thanked God
for this moment in my life.
Sachin!
- The crowd was aware
that I was returning after an injury.
I got a loud, standing ovation.
- Sachin!
There's no bigger moment
than this for a sportsperson.
This is what he lives for.
He's got it!
Sachin Tendulkar punches the air.
The entire stadium rises
to salute this master batsman.
This man has made history.
Sachin! Sachin!
Back then,
along with congratulating him
I also said that now
I was raising the bar for him.
And that he must score 100 centuries now.
He laughed as he went in.
Even I didn't know,
until I switched on the TV.
Why didn't you tell me?
Show him.
- My picture
with Sachin in the papers..
He's scored 35 centuries.
What a man!
He's God!
Say something on Sachin.
- Say something on Sachin..
Let me think. Next!
- He can't bat.
He can't bat.
- Great feeling.
A special day or a special person,
special champion.
Battery is charged.
- I saw his first 100 as well.
I was in the balcony.
- Thanks.
And on a lighter vein,
Adidas gave him a shoe.
It said Sachin-35.
They are making another one,
Anil-35
but that's my age.
Well, he's been great,
you know for Indian cricket.
But I am better.
I think Boost
is the secret of his energy.
Thank you, guys.
It's a wonderful team, and we've
been through ups and downs.
But every time, the team
has stuck together.
I hope we continue to do this.
And we'll all get the
World Cup in 2007, which is..
Yes!
- ...my dream
and I am sure it is our dream.
Hopefully, we will do that.
Thank you so much.
This is the most exciting job in cricket.
And one of the most challenging jobs
in cricket and I look forward
to the opportunity
and the honor to coach India.
There's no doubt that Greg Chappell
is a very accomplished coach.
He's not a warm
and fuzzy figure by any means.
Perhaps he didn't understand as much
about Indian cricket as he thought he did.
When he joined the team
few senior players were telling me
that they didn't think this coach
was doing any good to our team.
That he should change his attitude.
I've had about a gutful.
I need to tell you..
If I see one more batsman just
waste his time in the nets
I'm going to scream.
He was like a school headmaster.
His theory was very simple
divide and rule.
It's a tough job.
Today, Greg Chappell must tell
India's biggest superstar
Sachin Tendulkar,
he won't be opening the batting.
If he wants to be difficult
then that's just what I have to do.
I have to convince him or tell him
that for the next few games at least,
that's the way it's going to be.
The complete batting order
was reshuffled
30 days before the World Cup.
There was no logic behind that.
The other teams start
planning for the World Cup
10-12 months in advance.
Before leaving for West Indies,
I had told one of the board members
that the atmosphere
is not right in the team.
And I don't see this team going too far.
There was no trust in each other.
That belief was not there.
We were there as a team,
but we were not a team.
Knocked him over.
Mohammad Rafique starts well.
Aleem Dar!
Up goes the finger.
I never thought we would
lose against Bangladesh.
Everyone's a bit disappointed but..
There's still two games to go,
so there's no point being too upset about it.
Just have to put it behind us
and play well in the next two.
We knew that if we didn't win that game
we would be out of the tournament.
That's a great catch.
Brilliant!
Muttiah Muralitharan holds on this time.
That's the end of the
great Sachin Tendulkar.
Many of us, after the match was done
went to the washroom and cried.
Don't you think you're also answerable
to the one billion fans in India?
And you should say something now
at this point?
We didn't play well enough.
Is that all?
- We didn't play well enough.
Can you explain the reason behind that?
We didn't play well enough.
Down with Team India!
- Down!
Down with Team India!
- Down!
The BCCI.. They don't talk about it.
They're just quite happy to dissect
a lot of this and move on.
The kind of response we got when we landed
was as if we were criminals
as if we had killed a 100 people
and come back.
There were 40 commandoes
posted below my house.
There were also a couple of commandoes
inside the house.
It was a difficult phase.
I was very depressed.
In fact, I didn't leave home
for seven whole days.
That becomes a sort of defense mechanism.
It's easier because you can
just handle yourself at home
as you have your children and your family.
He wouldn't want
to go out of the house for days.
There were even articles
saying that I should
take a look at myself
in the mirror and decide
whether I should
continue to play cricket or not.
People who've got nothing to do
with Indian cricket
were also giving out their opinions.
He was so stressed..
I mean, that was a terrible time.
Ian Chappell said he should
look at himself in the mirror.
Why doesn't he look at himself
in the mirror first? That'll be fun.
Oh, he's got him.
That's beautifully bowled.
There was constant criticism of Sachin
in the media.
There were even reports
that Sachin was booed off his home ground.
Suddenly, the sport that had
given me everything in life
had made me experience
the worst day of my life.
I also contemplated retirement.
Not all dreams come true.
It was while I was at my lowest ebb
that my childhood batting hero called me.
I told him not to retire
because there is so much still left,
and what he could achieve
not just for himself, but also for India.
He told me that my career was not over.
There are brighter things to look forward to.
Mom, it's deep.
These photographers
will catch you if you cry.
Mom, I don't want to go. It's deeper.
- Okay..
Everything is safe.
Dad..
Sleeping or standing?
Standing.
You'll hurt my back.
Not my back.
You'll fall down.
I told both my children,
when they go to school
people might say things to them
and they may blame their father.
But they have to be calm
and not say anything back.
Next day, Sara told me
that someone told Arjun
we were knocked out from the World Cup
because of his father.
And I thought,
I've prepared my children so well
and I am sure
Arjun mustn't have said anything.
Arjun put him down on the floor
and was sitting on his chest.
And said,
Now you repeat what you said.
I asked him if he hit the guy.
He said that he let him go this time
but not next time.
Crazy!
My brother once told me
that in 2011,
there's this big tournament coming to India.
World Cup.
And the Final will take place in Mumbai.
Can you imagine holding
that beautiful trophy in your hands?
And that's when my next journey began.
I started chasing my dream.
2011 World Cup.
Throw 3-4 balls in front.
I always practiced to be a better player.
My day would be good the day I bat well.
I've practiced for thousands of hours.
Nothing could stop us from playing cricket
not even the monsoon.
What did you say?
He's doing target batting
with his eyes closed.
He has placed cones,
Gary is feeding him balls.
And he hit it absolutely perfectly.
And his view was,
once he has seen the ball initially
he should be able to move
to where he needs to move to,
to hit that ball.
Ball sense, you know, that ability
that intelligence about the game..
That was just unbelievable.
There's this feeling
that Sachin Tendulkar is created by God
to do well.
Sachin Tendulkar's story is one of
extraordinary dedication
and tremendous hard work.
Of course, it helped
that he was gifted
but so are other people.
It's what Tendulkar did with his gifts
that made him a legend.
The England team returned to India
after their tour was
abruptly abandoned
in the wake of the horrific
terrorist attack in Mumbai on 26/11.
The Indian team takes guard today
in the First Test match at Chennai.
You see, what we needed the next day
was a nervous India to come out
but what we got was Sachin
Tendulkar absolutely dominating.
And India wins!
Well, you can sense
that this is for Mumbai.
Hundreds and all these things
will give certain amount
of happiness to people
but what has happened in Mumbai
it's very hard to recover from that.
People saw Sachin as a superhero.
He brought a smile to their faces.
Sachin! Sachin!
Indian cricket at that time
was moving to the next level
with the Indian Premier League.
It was all a show.
It was for entertainment and for money.
An IPL without Sachin is unthinkable.
Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani
is now the richest
person in the world.
BMW India has signed Sachin Tendulkar
as its first brand ambassador.
The United States sees India
as a global power.
Sachin! Sachin! Sachin!
There is a lot to learn
from Sachin Tendulkar.
The whole world is connected
to his accomplishments.
The whole world is proud of him.
Children at a blind school today
were given words of encouragement
by Sachin Tendulkar.
And one day when you become famous singers
don't forget to give me your autograph.
Please..
He calls me his mother
and that is why I am here
to ward off the evil eye.
Sachin for me is someone
who is the collective consciousness
of the pride of India.
He kept pushing himself.
You know
he's pushed all the limits.
That's four.
He's got that fine.
First man on the planet to reach 200
and it's the Superman from India.
Sachin Tendulkar.
200 from 147.
Sachin!
Every month he's got a problem.
Wrist problem, finger problem, knee problem.
Before every game,
he will come to me for an hour.
And then, he will get
all the maintenance work done.
And in three years,
he got 18 international 100s.
"No matter what happens,
you have magic in your palms."
"If it is incomplete.."
If you mention the word boxing
you have to mention Muhammad Ali.
Basketball, Michael Jordan.
And when you speak about cricket
I would speak about Sachin Tendulkar.
What happened in match number 130?
You scored 16 and 128 runs not out,
against England.
In number 80?
- In that
you scored 76 and 65 runs
against Australia in Mumbai.
"Sachin! Sachin!"
"Sachin! Sachin!"
"Sachin! Sachin!"
"Sachin! Sachin!"
"Sachin! Sachin!"
He has got a billion people
who would throw themselves
in front of a train for this man.
So, his only release was to walk
on the cricket field.
Probably the only time he didn't have
200 people within 5 meters of him.
Sachin! Sachin!
I love cars.
I feel relaxed while driving.
I like travelling on any road.
Being Tendulkar is a pressure.
So going away has always
been an escape route.
So sweet!
Once you're inside..
- Come on, 1-2-3, jump.
I am not jumping.
Don't delete the video.
Save it.
I am scared.
Go..
Now give him that.
- Hold this fast..
I am feeling dizzy.
In my kids' company
I'd recall my father's words.
Cricket is just one
chapter of your life.
But until I had fulfilled my dream
I was not ready to turn the page.
Though I knew this would be
my last chance to fulfill it.
India will definitely win.
India is the best.
The host
and one of the favorites for the title
are getting primed for the World Cup.
The pressure was immense, but for Sachin,
it was at a very different level
because that was literally
the last chance to lift the cup.
Everyone just said one thing..
Please win the cup..
It became something
that started to bind
the entire team together.
We have to do this because Tendulkar
can't end a career without a World Cup.
Down the track.
Five World Cup hundreds
for the Little Master
more than any other player
in the history of cricket.
He is a genius.
Great shot, and it's going to be six.
Sachin Tendulkar,
99 international hundreds!
That's hit beautifully by Sachin Tendulkar
though mid-wicket.
That brings out the 94th one-day 50
for Sachin Tendulkar.
India into the Semi-Final
of the World Cup.
We flew to Mohali
where we were playing
the Semi-Finals against Pakistan.
Long Live Pakistan!
Possibly, one can say the most
tensed game of my life.
We went to the ground
security issues,
the food couldn't come.
So the players were upset.
I said, The entire
nation's hopes are on us.
If you're so hungry
then go out on the ground
and feast on runs and wickets.
Satisfy your craving out there.
Coming from him, everyone would listen.
The guy that we've always looked up to
you don't want to let him down.
Sachin! Sachin!
Once I asked him,
When you walk into the ground
and hundred thousand people
are shouting your name
what do you feel then?
And he said,
They remind me of my responsibility.
He has found the gap.
This time he goes over extra-cover and
it brings up Tendulkar's half century.
We scored 260 runs.
A little less than we had expected.
But it was a fighting total.
It's up in the air,
straight to Yuvraj Singh.
Out! Out!
Yuvraj Singh has got the Punjab
going now.
With India-Pakistan game
it's always about absorbing pressure.
That's surely going to be caught
by Sachin Tendulkar.
Oh, yes! Yes..
Oh, that's gone miles in the air.
Miles in the air and it's caught!
India have won a place..
Suddenly, we were in the Final.
We were very excited.
Because the whole country
was waiting for this.
Obviously, we want to celebrate
but I don't think
it's going to do us any good
if we stay up till 6 o'clock this morning.
So let's just be careful
how we manage ourselves
over the next two days
knowing that we still have a mission here.
Okay? And that mission is two days away.
The travel day, and a practice day
and then it's the Final of the World Cup.
The flight to Mumbai was a special one.
Lot of security to receive us
and I told my wife to join me on the way.
I've known him through each World Cup.
I knew that nothing
was more important to him than this.
And I knew that this was going to be
his final World Cup.
The day I was thinking about in 2007..
That moment had come
and just the final hurdle was left.
Final challenge.
"My country, my life.."
"My country, my life.."
"My country, my life."
"My country, I will win for you."
"My country, my life.."
"My country, my life.."
The reason I started playing cricket..
That moment was a few hours away from me.
And all roads in Mumbai today
leading to the Wankhede Stadium.
This is the biggest game
you'll have in four years.
The World Cup Final.
People have been
queuing up since morning
trying to get into the ground.
India playing in India.
Sachin Tendulkar playing the match.
It is his last World Cup.
I won't see such a big match in my lifetime.
The World Cup Final match in Mumbai..
I did not watch Sachin bat live.
I was alone at home
sitting on my lucky seat and watching
the match on my lucky television.
When you are standing
in the middle of a ground
and the national anthem is played
you feel the proudest.
You get goosebumps.
Sangakkara winning
the toss and batting first.
You can't help but think
that it is a big advantage.
He has played it fine..
Beats Yuvraj.
That's well placed, good timing too.
Gets it through into a..
Goes off-side, save your legs.
A high class innings
from a high class player.
The biggest of stages.
Mahela Jayawardene..
In the slot.
Whacked away!
What a way to end the innings!
Momentum for Sri Lanka, they believe.
Sri Lanka believe.
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Mumbai was where I started
my cricketing career.
And that is where the circle of my dreams
was being completed.
This is nothing but destiny.
The Little Master, of course
India's highest run scorer
in this tournament for a third time
and the all-time leading run-maker
in World Cup History.
And that was glorious.
Sachin Tendulkar's straight drive.
Splendid shot! No chance
for Muttiah Muralitharan
who watches the ball go by.
The master is looking
in good touch here.
242 more needed.
Lashith Malinga in his fourth over.
Outside edge!
I just went blank.
I was shocked!
As if everything had come to a halt.
I was shattered. Completely shattered.
I kept crying.
The immediate feeling that I had
was that..
I am walking in and he's walking out.
And I felt like
I was walking into a graveyard.
People are so connected to him
they are only reacting
on what's happening with him.
Such is the impact that he created.
In the air!
Gone! Brilliant.
Smashed away!
As you can see Dhoni telling him
you have got a boundary.
Now, just calm down.
Bowled him!
A needless shot.
Gambhir is gone for 97.
India needs 52 from 50.
New man in, Yuvraj.
Before the World Cup,
I was struggling with cancer
nobody knew, I didn't know.
So, my body was hurting.
Pulled away!
And I told Sachin,
I don't know what to focus on.
And he told me
You're going to matter
when it matters the most.
Remember my words.
That's a fierce one.
Over the boundary.
I was sitting in the dressing room
during the entire innings.
I had Sehwag next to me
and I asked him not to leave
the place.
So I sat there and we talked
but I had no clue that he wouldn't let me
get up through the entire match.
So I controlled my urge
to urinate for a really long time.
I told him, What you see
on television
is exactly what's happening out there
so you sit here, you're not moving
and we'll only go out
when the last run is scored.
"I praise you, my motherland!"
"I praise you, my motherland!"
India lifts the World Cup.
"I praise you, my motherland!"
"Vande Mataram!"
We were so happy.
We were jumping out of joy
on the ground
and everyone had tears of joy
in their eyes.
I was looking at these pictures,
and I said
I've known this man since he was 14
and I haven't seen this kind of emotion.
Winning that World Cup was his dream
and it took him such a long time
to achieve that.
I mean, you know how special that is.
We did it for Sachin.
Our one dream was to do it for Sachin
and the whole of India,
and we did it for him.
Ask Sachin about the biggest
moment in his life.
I think above all his centuries,
above all his achievements
he will say that it was the World Cup.
"Your one look of admiration.."
It was something else.
The whole night, people were celebrating,
it was like some sort of dream.
It was one of the most
wonderful days of my life.
Sachin, last World Cup.
- Sachin's last World Cup..
He deserved the World Cup.
Indians won the World Cup
only for Sachin Tendulkar!
"Vande Mataram!"
"Vande.."
Hard to express what I feel today.
I've waited for 22 years so..
It's been a long time.
Surely the proudest day of my life.
"Vande Mataram..
Vande Mataram!"
"Vande Mataram..
Vande Mataram!"
Well, he's carried the burden
of the nation for years
so it's time we carried him
on our shoulders.
My life has been fantastic.
I don't want to change it one bit.
Whatever has happened in my life,
I am absolutely happy with it.
Yes, I constantly used to be under pressure.
I'm extremely proud
to have played for my country.
I think after a while,
great sportsmen do so much
that they kind of answer
all the questions that we have.
And there's only one question left
which is,
How long are they going to stay?
Works it away and that is it.
It's an absolutely
mind-boggling event, this..
One hundred 100's
in international matches.
Outstanding achievement
and richly deserved
for someone who's been so special
in this world of cricket.
I cannot complain about anything
because how can you complain
when people love you?
Whenever I heard my name
being screamed inside the stadium..
Those moments are priceless.
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Tendulkar's retirement
became a national event.
There was no other discussion.
Everyone just had one thing in mind.
How to bid goodbye to Tendulkar?
Sachin!
Sachin!
Sachin!
Sachin!
Sachin!
Sachin!
Sachin!
Sachin!
Sachin!
We all knew that Tendulkar
would retire someday.
But it suddenly hit everybody.
Is this the last we're going
to see of Tendulkar?
All of India was in tears.
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Settle down, let me talk.
I'll get more and more emotional.
My life between 22 yards
for 24 years.
It's hard to believe that wonderful journey
is coming to an end.
But I would like to take this opportunity
to thank people who have played
an important role in my life.
The most important person in my life
and I've missed him a lot..
My father.
Without his guidance
I don't think I would have
been standing here
in front of you.
So, I miss him today.
My mother.
Since the day I started playing cricket
she just prayed continuously.
And I think her prayers and her blessings
have given me the strength
to go out and perform.
Ajit, my brother.
We've lived this dream together.
And it all started from the age of 11
when he took me to Mr. Achrekar, my coach.
Sir has never, ever said
well played to me
because he thought I would get complacent
and stop working hard.
Maybe he can push his luck
and wish me now.
The most beautiful thing happened
to me in 1990
when I met my wife, Anjali.
Thanks for bearing with me
and always staying by my side
through the ups and downs.
You're the best partnership
I've had in my life.
Congratulations, Ms. Anjali.
Our Sachin is all yours now.
I couldn't stop crying.
I was really worried for him.
I wondered what his life is
going to be like without cricket.
Then the two precious diamonds
of my life, Sara and Arjun.
On special occasions like their birthdays
their annual day, sports day..
I've missed out on all those things.
I promise you, the next
16 years or even beyond that
everything is for you.
I know my speech is getting a bit too long
but this is the last thing
I want to say.
Time has flown by rather quickly.
But the memories
that you have left with me
will always be with me forever and ever.
Especially Sachin! Sachin!
That will reverberate in my ears
until I stop breathing.
- Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin! Sachin!
Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.
I'm proud of all my children
but of course, I am proud of Sachin.
So, no doubt, he's an excellent person
but something more than that I find..
That's why every person feels that he
is their family member
which is a great thing
of pride for me.
"O dear.."
"O dear.."
"My friend!"
"The star of the world"
"which has risen from a world beyond."
"It has risen from a world beyond,
and will shine now."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life,
I will win for you."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life,
I will win for you."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life,
I will win for you."
"Everyone must believe this."
"Everyone must now understand this,
why not early this time?"
"The one who is made
to touch the skies.."
"He was my life,
he meant everything to me."
"I have this feeling all the time."
"Everyone must now understand this"
"why not early this time?"
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life.."
"My motherland, my life,
I will win for you."
