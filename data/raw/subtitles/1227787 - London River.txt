- Sure.
Here's a bench.
I want to apologize.
I thoughtyour son manipulated
my daughter.
I thoughtso too.
I was expecting the worst.
I thought my son was involved
in the bombings.
I don't know my son.
He's like a stranger.
I did not raise him.
Your hands are rugged.
These are the wounds of Nature.
I am a forest ranger.
I heal trees.
I protect them.
My hands are rugged too.
The farm... the soil...
the stones...
My daughter is ashamed of my hands.
She hates soil work.
I fight against elms' death.
But I can't do anything.
They disappear.
The last ones are in Guernsey,
my island.
I can't stay much longer.
The hotel is too expensive.
But our children are alright.
Goodbye.
Your son lives here with my daughter.
You can sleep here.
There's a couch.
I'll think about it...
Alright.
Thank you for letting me in.
Sure.
Have a seat.
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, I'd like some tea.
I'd like some tea too.
With some lemon, please.
And pipping hot.
My husband was in the Royal Navy.
I got married when I was
very young.
He is a catholic.
I am a protestant.
More or less.
He died in the war.
Jane never met her father.
I raised her alone.
Our lives aren't that different.
I don'tsmoke usually.
25 years withoutsmoking.
But...
- Are you tired?
- Yes, a little.
Me too.
- Is he sure?
- Yes, he is!
He's going to the police.
They must have left the flat
after 10:30...
The bombings took place
at 9 am...
They're in France!
She is in France!
They will call!
Wantsome apple?
It's good!
- Here.
- Thank you.
It's my brother.
I'm going home.
I'm going back to work too.
Nature does not wait.
- Some more?
- Yes, thank you.
Your hair is very long.
- Sorry?
- Your hair is very long.
Ah, my hair.
You don't like it?
- Yes, I do. It's very pretty.
- Or else, I can cut it.
Mr. Ousmane, are you sleeping?
No, I'm notsleeping.
I'm thinking.
I'm happy our children are alive.
Will you go back to Africa?
As soon as I find Ali,
I'll bring him back home.
As promised.
Yourfamily will be happy.
I think so.
I have been away for a long time.
How about you?
What will you do?
Tomorrow, I'll go back to Guernsey.
My poor brother is waiting for me.
My dog too.
And my donkeys.
It's the police.
I am very sorry.
Your children were in the bus
that exploded at Tavistock Square.
- No, they are on holiday.
- DNA confirmed it.
They left at about 8...
...to get a credit card from the bank.
Then, they took the bus.
- I want to see my daughter.
- Sorry, it's impossible.
- Our psychologist will come.
- Sorry.
Please...
Elisabeth...
Can I speak to Aja?
Aja.
It's me, Ousmane.
I'm in England.
In London.
Our son Ali left us.
He died in the attacks
in London.
The bus he was in
exploded.
There will be no burial.
None.
No.
There's no body.
I'll call you later.
It was God's will.
He meant the world to me.
I think my son loved your daughter.
Maybe she loved him too.
Real happiness, is to love life.
That's one of our sayings.
We should notpart on a bad note.
Will I die in a city or a forest?
Nobody knows how we'll end.
Have a good trip.
And thank you.
Thank you too.
Whatshould we do with the elm?
- Cut it.
- Are you coming with us?
No, do it alone.
