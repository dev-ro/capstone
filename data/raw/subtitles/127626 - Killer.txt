A guy got out,
lit a smoke... and croaked.
Andrze G., a.k.a. "Guillotine",
has been shot,
the 4th victim this year.
Inspector Fish,
is this a gang war?
- In 5 min.
- I don't get it...
I spoke to my man...
Is this a gang war?
No war whatsoever.
That's a contract killing.
The elusive Killer again?
When will you get him?
The police works by the book.
How many more victims until
you get the legendary Killer?
Legendary? Nonsense.
There is no Killer.
It's the media invention.
If not Killer, who kills then?
This is Ewa Szañska...
A man does, ma'am.
Directed by
Your cigs, sir.
Filters?
I said no filter.
No such stuff in the city.
What city is this?
Las Vegas.
Looks like power outage.
Where to?
I'm going to Zygmunt.
That architectural wonder
can be yours.
It'll be Europe's largest casino.
And we'll remain the owners.
Officially yes.
In fact, we'll have 98%.
Only 2% left to split?
We've invested a bundle.
Mr. Lipski, gimmi a break.
The building is yours when
the money's in the Swiss bank.
No Swiss accounts, please.
Cash only or no deal.
Cash? What's cooking?
How do we collect it?
In 3 days...
a dollar-packed container
will arrive at the Warsaw airport.
And we collect the delivery
ust like that?
From Waldek.
Our friend Waldek...
Just show him... this.
- And the other half?
- Waldek will have it.
Any problems?
No. But why tear up
the money?
Rather than to America
I'm going to the land of these.
They're expanding, sumbitches!
Let me go!
It's a mistake!
A mistake!
That was my wife's middle name.
- What's that?
- I don't get it.
Who's this creep?
Get me the one I need.
Number One.
For me you, Ewa,
are Number One.
I'm talking about
Guillotine.
Who's that?
That's enough or I'll
get lumbago.
Is that Guillotine?
That's your stupid pal,
Stan!
Only you, myself, and Stan
know it.
But all the viewers will think
he's Guillotine.
Hi, what's up?
- To cut it short...
- Before I forget:
They've collared Killer.
- They have?!
- The radio said.
What?
They got him.
- Just that?
- Isn't that enough?
Hi, Killer.
If you totter like a geisha
you'll kill yourself.
OK, spill it.
Your name and occupation?
Jurek Kiler, ti driver.
Your name's Killer
and your handle's 'Killer' too.
You're Killer!
If you say it's a mistake,
I'll hit you!
It's a mistake.
What d'you think?
They're here to protect you
not me.
Boss, no third degree, please!
I've been on his tail for 3 years!
Quiet!
It's a tragic misunderstanding.
My name's Jurek Kiler.
A ti driver,
side number 7775.
You were real good, Killer
but you're collared now.
Cause I've been better!
46 times better!
Now you're in for it!
For life, man.
But first confess to the DA.
Con-fess? To the DA?
You think we sent
a SWAT team
to get an innocent cabbie?
And our boys have
nothing else to do?!
You botched up the ob.
And forgot to tidy up.
This tsatske was found
where you did in Guillotine.
And in your ti,
a Steyr sniper rifle.
Which killed forty in Europe
and in the former Soviet Unión.
There's moratorium
on death penalty,
but we'll make an exception
in your case.
In any case, you're
in the poky till you croak.
Hey, smartass!
Making fun of the fifth
Commandment?
Not at all!
Truth is you killed scum!
But it's your hide as if
they'd been innocent men.
And now sing, please.
Start talking.
Tell us, Killer,
and you'll be better-off.
Not much better.
But.
You'd better...
You know what?
We'll get you a single cell.
Else we'll lock you up
with Hairy.
No idea who Hairy is?
None whatsoever.
I'll say nothing.
- Killer!
- Hairy.
Killer recognized me.
It's an honor!
Out with you, shitty dudes!
Make room for Mr. Killer!
He's Boss now!
What's wrong, Ugly?
- OK. with me.
- Move your ass, X!
Sit down, please.
We didn't expect you.
I'd have had it cleaned up.
These stinkers are messy.
Thanks. It's... cool.
How did you off
that Turk in Munich?
I read it in the rags.
That Turk?... Easy
- But how?
- From a distance.
With a sniper rifle.
- Steyr?
- Yeah.
With infra-red sights.
But that explosión?
Explosión? In Mannheim?
In Munich.
Oh, that. Syntex.
- What?
- Czech plastic.
How did you plant it?
The car was watched, right?
What?
Easy. I had a... toy car,
radio-controlled.
I stuffed it with plastic,
sent it under the Turk's car
and wham!
See, moron, you'd die trying
to figure that out.
That reading makes you dumb.
But that's kid stuff.
Any moron can plant a bomb.
But to face your mark
is a real challenge.
The fatter the better.
But for a fatso you need
dum-dum ammo.
Deadly effective.
See, X?
You've spilled the soup.
Where's your sausage?
I've eaten it.
Don't hurry next time.
No way, Miss...
Miss Ewa.
Dear Mieczyslaw, I must see him.
Anybody, Miss Ewa, but Killer.
Killer's Europe-class criminal.
We have no luminaries
of his standing.
We can't afford hiding Killer.
I like you, Miss Ewa,
prize your professionalism,
but you must understand.
I see.
So here's another proect.
A documentary series:
Polish Penitentiary Pantheon.
Interesting.
Could you help me
with a list of 8...
12 best wardens in Poland.
That many of us?
Let's see.
Czesiek from Leczyca.
Retired now. How about that?
No, only wardens in active service.
Mirek from Bia³o³êka.
A baldie. How about that?
No, only creme de la creme:
dashing, IQ over 240,
speak foreign languages.
Piotrków! Right!
Stan Alcatraz is in there.
That's it, Stan... No.
No go.
The great escape, right?
Exactly. 600 cons
on the lam now.
Must've done it
with chartered buses or what?
Stan's hair turned gray.
- Gray-haired are out.
- You see it your self.
At least one name.
And he'll make great copy.
How about
the Pillar of Polish Prisons?
Or the Bulwark?
Or ust the Star.
Great! The Star of Polish
Penitentiary system,
Warden Mieczyslaw Klonisz.
You mean me?
Sure. Neither gray-haired
nor bald,
let alone retired.
No one ever sprung on me!
An ideal candidate.
But you must be very busy.
I'll find some time out
for the Polish prison system.
Thank you very much.
Guys!
Warden, sir...
Hello.
My name's Ewa Szanska.
I know you from TV.
I'm making a program on you.
On a ti-driver?
Killer, fool Inspector Fish
and other Koaks.
I'm not a plant, Killer.
The real Killer is at large.
I'm a ti-driver,
side number 7775.
I killed nobody. That lummox
Fish made a mistake.
Lummox?
Right. I got you on tape.
You hung around there
when Guillotine got killed.
Is gawking forbidden?
Pure coincidence.
I had to buy smokes.
OK. Why did you kill?
The public wants to know?
For dough.
What did you feel?
Excitement, the smell of money.
That'll make them happy.
Remember your first time?
It was on a mountain hike.
I pushed my math teacher
off the cliff.
- I'm serious.
- So am I.
Your first contract killing.
My student board ordered it.
No kidding.
Your first contract killing.
Kiev, Ukraine in 1989.
Four born killers,
armed to the teeth.
I, my AK-47, my pony...
- How was it?
- I was shot dead.
Start talking
like a killer, damn it!
If he claims to be a cabbie,
it doesn't mean he lives
off the ti alone.
His contractors paid well
for his hits.
The police know those people?
We know a lot
and we'll know more...
You know shit!
I can say any more.
So let me tell you
what I've found out.
One of Killer's clients
was the boss of the Polish
underworid,
Stefan Siarzewski, alias Siara.
He must've had Andrzej G.,
the 'Guillotine', killed.
What d'you say to that?
You're dead, you TV slut!
You said Killer was
the media invention.
Sorry, ust a trick of the trade.
Outta here soon
and I got some savings.
Enough to off Big Ear.
I chip in.
I don't get it.
Piece of cake for you.
Pardon?
Do him in
and take all I have.
- All I have.
- I'll think about it.
Is that Killer?
That sad sack is no Killer.
Sad sack?
That's what you are!
They say Killer has already
killed an inmate.
He choked him with a salt
shaker. With the cap, that is.
The shaker or the cap?
The perforated cap.
Where're they moving him?
To mimum security.
- Where exactly?
- This I can't say.
Maybe you don't know?
I do, but I won't say.
Hey!
What's up?
Why have we stopped?
Must be the fuel pump!
You think so?
Must be the fuel pump!
It's the fuel pump all right.
Could I take a leak?
My bladder will bust!
A true killer got no bladder.
What has he got, then?
A true killer has a pump.
But the pump's busted.
What shall I do?
Wet your pants.
I gotta go!
I can't hear.
Must be the pump.
Stay put. Could be a trap.
Sending reinforcements.
Ten-four?
That's a ten roger.
Who wants to piss?
Killer.
- Tell him to wet his pants.
- Done already.
I gotta go!
Hi, who's the idiot in charge?
Actually, I am.
You know who's in there?
Actually, I do.
Great.
You know who'll write
a report to the minister?
Actually, I don't.
I will and won't even mention
a fuel pump.
The report will be on...
Guess who?
We're taking
the prisoner along.
I don't gotta go now.
Up yours.
What did you say?
Actually, nothing.
I thought
you looked different!
Come on in, Killer!
With a cold hand
and a warm heart.
Skinny, free him!
Name's Skinny.
I like you, 'cause
you got balls, like me.
One thing bothers me, though.
- May I ask you something?
- Shoot, Stefan.
How come they collared you?
You always took good cover.
On alert as a prairie-dog
and cautious as a May-bug.
You done so many hits
and I never even saw you.
By phone, fax, e-mail,
but never in person.
How come the blues sniffed?
Wish I knew.
Why, you don't sus me!
Like I say,
I wish I knew.
- Fish calling Aquarium.
- I copy you.
- How was the trip?
- That fuel pump again.
Why, State Security took him.
What? 3h. ago?!
What is it, Stefan?
Why this crying?
You ust gotta be tough.
I'm all alone in this worid.
Like a pinky, I got nobody.
Only hoods around me.
I'm all alone.
You're a very nice guy,
a very nice killer.
Your health, my one
and only hitman.
Go thru it all alone...
Don't turn your heart
to a stone...
Hush!
I trust nobody but you.
What is it?
I'm home, right?
Where've you been, slut?
Won't you introduce me?
With pleasure.
My wife, a slut she goes out.
My best friend.
Care for a sandwich
or fried eggs?
Fry your tits!
You know who that is?
Mr. Killer himself!
He eats chateaubriand, oysters,
anything he wants,
not your sloppy sandwiches!
Killer?
Gabrysia Siarzewska.
Glad to meet you.
Name's Jurek.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Beat it.
We got business to do.
That Gabrysia... your lady?
- Her name's Rysia.
- Then why Gab-rysia?
'Cause she's stupid.
From a singles' bar.
There's no Killer as such.
He's a media invention.
Who shoots then?
This is Ewa Szanska...
That bitch I don't like!
A TV slut!
Why?
Very nice and pretty.
Cause she is.
- You think so?
- I do.
Here's an offer.
Off her and I'll pay you
as if she were President.
You flipped?
I don't kill women!
Especially beautiful ones.
Beautiful?
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Siara.
That's a ten roger.
Go and watch TV.
Look Killer.
I left nothing to chance
and had it all planned.
What friend would
I've been to
without a chance
for you to pay me back?
Thanks, Siara.
It would've looked I dissed you.
But I respect you more
than my folks and partners.
What do I do for you,
bosom buddy?
You'll get a car,
a VIP suite in town,
a piece you like,
and some cash for starters.
What do I do?
Two obs, big and small.
The small one?
That Szanska from TV
drives me crazy.
And the big one?
A tougher act.
Only two days for it.
Who's the mark?
Ferdinand Lipski...
Make it look
like a car accident.
Very difficult
but could be done.
One more thing.
Ferdinand Lipski got
something I want back.
A bill of 2000 Colombian pesos.
Actually, a half of it,
which is very important.
Hi, Killer, got a sec?
Not really, I'm already late.
The son-of-a-bitch must
bite the dust.
- Holy shit, who's that?
- My husband.
That's not my bag.
My ex. I got some dough...
I'll be right back.
Then you'll tell me.
I'll check my agenda
and squeeze you in.
Thanks. You're real cool.
- Well?
- He's agreed!
What do I tell Minister,
the media, and the public?
You're a laughingstock!
You can't handle anything!
Your future
is in your shitty hands.
Out! And don't you
show up without Killer!
- And that's that.
- Yes, sir.
Fish?
You're staying.
Killer is your problem.
You know what they say?
Wanna kick ass?
A cop is best.
He won't hit back
cause he's scared.
Scared? He ust can't.
It's illegal.
Exactly! So from now on,
screw the law!
- May I?
- You must!
We must have Killer.
Not because some
scum's dead.
The number of killers in
ail must tally.
People must feel safe,
and the police must be respected.
Else we're in over our heads!
- You must be a bull-terrier!
- I will be.
- A raging bull!
- I will.
Like Tommy Lee Jones,
in 'Fugitive'!
- I will.
- Out!
The police is after a dangerous
criminal, Jurek Killer,
suspected of forty
contract killings,
who fled while convoyed.
300,000 zl reward...
Did I hear right?
How much? 300000'?
Enough for both of us.
What do you, asshole,
know about killing?
Two hard tomatoes.
Likewise cucumbers.
A bunch of radishes... hard.
Mr. Killer? I know you from TV.
I have a ob for you.
- How much?
- No matter.
- It's my old man.
- I'll think about it.
Faster!
On the double!
Suspect seen
in the roadside inn.
Rush someone smart
to find out.
The owner and patrons
are scared stiff.
Killer knocked out
two bruisers.
- Talk to them.
- They haven't come to yet.
The worid's a loony bin!
That's the one.
That's Siara's man.
So Siara's sprung Killer.
A war? All right.
Let's go!
Yes? What is it?
Look, Miss, Killer's got
a contract on you.
A contract?
He's out to get you.
Have a nice day.
Quiet!
Don't shout, it's me!
- Who?
- Kiler.
I won't touch you!
Don't panic!
- What do you want?
- Talk.
Get out!
I got a contract on you.
Go right ahead!
What are you waiting for?
Shoot!
Ewa, I'm no Killer.
- And that?
- Siara gave it to me.
He thinks I'm Killer.
And so does Fish.
Everybody does.
There's a reward on your head.
- You calmed down?
- A bit.
- May I sit down?
- Please do.
- And you think I'm Killer?
- Not only I.
I've never killed anybody.
And Big-Ear?
- Just an accident.
- Bullshit!
If I were Killer
you'd be dead by now.
- Trust me.
- No.
OK, I'm Killer.
But I have had it.
I call it quits.
- Why?
- Let's say...
Guilty conscience.
Won't you offer me a drink?
What's yours?
Some uice.
Or club soda.
I'm driving Siara's car.
Sorry I barged in.
- I had to warn you.
- Against yourself?
As long as I'm Killer,
you're safe.
I had to come here.
- And my address?
- From Siara.
He wants you killed
and one Lipski.
- Ferdinand Lipski?
- Right.
- This Lipski?
- Correct.
But Senator Lipski protects Siara.
Till Friday. And that's
when I have to kill him.
Odd.
If I don't,
Siara will kill me.
Come to heel!
Come here quick.
Sit! Your paw.
That's a good dog.
Down!
What's that?
- Hi, Evita.
- Hi.
Good evening, Inspector.
Come to heel, Skinny!
Let's go!
For a walk.
Freeze!
Open up!
Hop in!
- Why?
- In the kennel, Skinny!
MASSAGE PARLOR
Out!
Follow my drift?
But I didn't... nothing.
See how dumb you are?
- So how was it?
- Armed assault.
He sprayed the police car.
Inspector fired
eleven warning shots.
And hit him in the knee.
That's our report.
Not my leg, please!
Shut your trap!
I'll tell you everything
but don't shoot!
Question One.
- You always wet your pants?
- I do.
Question Two.
Why did Siara free Killer?
Killer got some hits
to do for him.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- With Siara?
- No!
You don't know, eh?
Which knee?
Left or right?
I don't know, I swear!
Killer showed up ust once
and then disappeared.
Even if Siara knows,
he won't tell me.
You see!
A very important day, this,
in your shitty life.
You're beginning
a new, pissy life now.
Working for Siara,
but report to me everything.
Remember,
Killer's whereabouts.
Am I bothering you?
Come on in, please.
The door was open so...
That's all right.
- Shall I wash your back?
- I've already done it.
You like it here?
- Super!
- Italian design.
And that swine, my husband,
lays kids here.
- Kids?
- From that grade school.
- Pour me a drink.
- What's yours?
Moonshine.
- The mess I've gotten in!
- You, Rysia?
Even my name sounds weird.
I meant to say Gabrysia,
or even - Gabriella.
Siara's a monster!
He beats me,...
The tightwad!
See my cosmetics?
Cheapies all!
Look at me! I can't even
afford a beauty parlor!
Unbelievable.
When I complain he threatens
to deep six me in the Vistula!
Claims I'm a wastrel
and won't give me a penny!
Wait, I got something.
Siara gave it to me.
You want some?
Buy yourself cosmetics.
300 bucks?
You nuts?
What can it buy? Q-tips?
You meant well, I know.
You're a nice guy,
a real European,
well-traveled... Kiev, Munich.
And you know
how to treat a lady.
I didn't come to weep here.
There's business to do.
Only you can help me.
Only I?
What's this business?
Kill Siara, my husband.
What?
Gabrysia, I'd like to help
but he sprung me.
He helped me out.
Got me a ob.
Only to ice Lipski.
And that's that.
He could benefit
from Lipski's death.
And I...
happen to know his plans.
What plans?
I'm talking
loads of dough.
Yes?
In two days, an overseas
cargo comes in.
Siara wants to kill Lipski
and take it all.
So you kill him
and then do Siara in.
And the spoils go to...
You, Gabriela?
No, Killer, us.
Fifty-fifty.
Interesting.
Get down to brass tacks.
Next time.
She came to order Siara
killed and you two drank vodka?
She did. I couldn't
throw her out.
Sure... a drunk woman?
Not drunk. Unhappy.
Siara wanted to deep six her
in the Vistula.
She can't afford cosmetics!
You call it quits,
only to kill a thug
so that his moll
could buy cosmetics?
I'm considering the proposition.
I call the cops,
or end up an accomplice!
I could draw 5 years.
Thanks to my good manners,
I know why Lipski must die.
Since I'm taking the risk,
you'll tell me all.
On camera.
Here's my plan.
Two veggies for
Mr. Ferdinand Lipski.
I didn't order any.
- This is the Police.
- Nor the Police.
I must see
President Lipski.
Funny getup, that.
Disguise. Don't disturb us
for the next 15 min.
Siara wants me killed?
That moron,
that cloned sheep!
He's zilch without me!
Shall we talk about it?
Abso-bloody-lutely!
I used to work for you.
Just once. A long time ago.
How much did he offer you?
Sorry, trade secret.
If he'd been generous,
I'd be up there
on the roof,
with a Steyr rifle.
- A snowball chance?
- Exactly.
Ten times as much,
though he's not worth it.
On one condition.
I must see his carcass
Friday at the latest.
The snag is
Friday is in two days.
What's the deadline?
I play golf at 7.
8 a.m., before breakfast?
Very difficult
but could be done.
Is that real pizza?
Veggy whopper
a 44.80 zl.
For two.
I'm expecting someone!
Try somewhere else!
Parking violation?
Gaby, it's me!
Killer, you can fool a girl!
Hush, or I blow it!
OK, sit down and tell me.
The ball's in your court.
I ust wanted to know
how you manage.
Thanks, never better.
Contracts piling up.
Seven so far.
Why?
What contracts?
Siara must be killed first!
Now listen!
A container flies in Friday...
with incredible loads
of money.
As Siara and Lipski
will have been iced,
you collect the container.
You think I'll get it
ust like that?
Yes, since you'll have
a half of a bill.
So what?
And a man there
will have the other half.
Okay, I'll have that half...
How do I know him?
Flash your half
and he's sure to spot you.
Sounds amateurish a bit.
But you're a pro.
That's why I chose you.
OK. Who's got the bill?
Actually... I don't know.
You can't be serious.
I may not be,
but the money is.
- Ewa, this one?
- No.
- This would do.
- You like it?
And the color?
Where's the dealer?
Killer, throw it back!
There it goes!
Hello, I'm from TV.
I'd like to...
Killer?!
Hairy!
Holy smoke!
X!
- You both sprung?
- Amnesty.
- I said I would.
- What a getup?
From Siara.
Good to see you.
We got the dough for Big-Ear.
What dough?
What Big-Ear?
What're you talking about?
Can I take that navy blue
for an hour?
Be my guest.
A deal is a deal.
The dough is yours.
Come on! It was an accident.
We got money for a car,
but I'll fix this unk.
Why don't you buy one?
And forget Big-Ear.
No, it's a matter of honor.
OK, Hairy lends
me that navy blue.
And you give me 2000.
2000 bucks, quid, or what?
Colombian pesos. Tomorrow.
- Going strong?
- Risk-free.
Deal.
More smoke!
You know what to say?
- What frame have you got?
- Beautiful, American.
But he has sweat pants on!
I'll zoom in on him
for a closeup.
May I say something?
Sounds like high brass here
rather than a cop
on the beat.
Make up something simple.
Better figure out
how to get 2000 pesos.
Let's wait for the magic hour.
No. Stan, down!
Jaros³aw, camera!
You down, too.
We need two bodies.
Lipski had a driver, remember?
Where's Killer?
Siara got him digs
in town.
What digs?
A classy apartment.
Where in town, moron?
Siara didn't say.
You were to find out.
I didn't ask you to listen
to Siara,
but to find out yourself.
Yes, but it's hard.
Come here, please!
You didn't follow what I said.
I try my best.
It's your ass on the line.
Get it?
I do.
I can switch
to second and third now.
Don't do it to me, please.
Where's Killer?
- I remember now!
- Where?
102 Dzika St. ap. 67.
This may do, right?
Maybe...
X is already late.
Let's start
that candid interview.
No camera.
Try a dry run.
I don't know what to ask you.
Hi, X!
You got it?
Sure.
2000 pesos?
Colombian?
You bet. Colombian not Cuban.
So gimmi.
I sure will.
It's hard to get those pesos
in this country.
But you got them?
- Yes?
- Yes.
Let's have them!
I tried the flea market.
Nothing doing.
They said, "Go north.
You may get Chilean".
"They net twice a much".
I thought better of it
and went to the embassy.
And got them without hassle.
What's that?
2000 pesos.
But I need 2000 pesos
in one bill!
What's the difference?
I'll fix the drinks first.
You know what?
I'll turn on the TV.
They may say something.
Come! They're reporting!
Lemon...
an olive, tomato, and vodka.
Come or you'll miss it!
- Lipski's kaput.
- Kicked the bucket?
Last night Ferdinand Lipski,
one of the richest Poles, died...
A ob of a real pro.
- You deserve an Oscar.
- The police suspect
the brake malfunction
caused the crash.
You fooled them cop morons.
This should be recorded.
I am doing it.
This is Ewa Szañska...
You're a genius.
With me you need
no other hitman.
- To you.
- Thanks.
Gimme the bill
and we're all square.
See this wallet?
It's a wallet all right.
These FL ring no bells?
FL stands for Liechtenstein.
I got an account there...
for a rainy day.
It's Lipski's wallet.
FL - Ferdinand Lipski!
Give me that half.
A half of that bill.
Why, I couldn't come
empty-handed.
Wait, Stefan...
Something is out of whack.
I put it on the desk
in case I forget. And I did.
- But you got it?
- Yes, on the desk.
Don't forget it tomorrow.
You can bank on it.
Step on it, Killer!
Scram!
Scram yourself.
You'll mess the upholstery!
Inspector Fish.
Freeze or I'll shoot!
- What's up?
- An ambush.
How come?
They've set up a trap.
- And he knows my address?
- No idea!
- These sandwiches for whom?
- Want one?
Shove it, snitch!
Why? I warned you?
Out with you, snitch!
If I were one, I would've told
Fish about the showdown.
What?
- You know it well!
- Out!
- Inspector?
- Where have you been?
Got the sandwiches?
What showdown?
Siara will clash with Lipski?
Are you sure?
- How are you?
- I'll be fine.
Don't ever get in the line
of fire.
I'm sorry, sir.
You messed up our chase.
Never again, sir.
Fish tracked down my hideaway.
They're after me.
- Can you put me up?
- Where will you sleep?
On the sofa.
So we record our interview
tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow's the day.
Tomorrow's Friday?
And what did you think?
Tell me.
We get up early.
So let's go to bed.
That's right.
Where will I sleep?
- You said, 'On the sofa'.
- Did I?
Tomorrow's a hard day.
You've got it all worked out.
Yes, but there's always a risk.
And if I sleep on the sofa...
So you'd rather take my bed?
It's not the point!
So?
What if I don't come back?
It'd be a shame...
you know...
to fail to round off
our acquaintance.
After such an endgame
you wouldn't interest me
as Killer.
Maybe as Jurek?
I want you to come back
in one piece.
I will but don't tell me
to sleep on the sofa.
SEDATIVE
One more, ust in case.
Five will do no harm, either.
The left is his.
The left... the left.
Coffee?
No, thanks. High blood pressure.
Better spare my pump.
Left... oh shit!
I can't drink two.
- Got that half?
- In the car. Just a sec!
- Beat it!
- Almost over!
Out with this spray!
I've got it!
Why this TV?
It's a fake.
You wanted a hearse?
Well, Killer,
you are the best!
Respect for the dead!
I got carried away.
He's had it.
My cut now.
Here. And a bonus.
The Colombian
peso stands very low.
- Want to have it?
- Easy, guys. He's Killer.
A misunderstanding.
Drop your guns. Out!
Let me go.
It's not a regular bill.
It opens the sesame,
and you'll be Ali Baba.
Screw Ali Baba,
I want my cut!
Waldek at the airport
has the other half.
This will get you incredible
loads of fucking greenbacks!
Enough for us both.
- Why me?
- You're a pro.
Why not yourself?
Too damned risky.
But I'll cover you.
Bring the container
to the parking lot.
I'll be there.
Happy?
You're a genius!
Have you had breakfast?
No, leave me alone!
You'll be hungry.
I work on an empty stomach.
You know what a shot
in the gut means?
Silly me.
I'll bring some sandwiches
to the airport.
Hurry up!
Easy.
He could wake up!
Any coffee left?
Forget it. Action stations!
Don't rush me.
Done.
Turn off the camera!
The bill!
Good ob.
You're a real pro.
- It's not ust a half of a bill.
- I know.
It's a key
to a sesame, I guess.
A guy at the airport
has the other half.
You show him and get
a container of lettuce.
Why not by yourself?
They'd collar me.
I'll wait at the parking lot.
And my cut?
You're finished here
and need a change of climate.
I'll fix you for money
in a classy hideaway.
Easy street forever.
And for your lady too.
Thanks. Let's set to.
- What's the matter?
- My kidney!
Too much booze.
Maybe, but it hurts as if
I'd been clobbered with a club.
Holy shit! Lipski's gorrilas!
Siara's hayseeds, aren't they?
What're you waiting for?
- What's going on here?
- They're shooting a film.
- And I'm not starring?
- Scram! It's a dilly!
They'll envy you...
your cameraman.
But the sound is shitty.
We'll have to overdub shots.
Don't push me, damn it!
Let's wrap it
or they'll kill one another.
We won't interfere.
Do we get up?
Let's see who wins.
- The white flag?
- Wait till it's over.
Now we come in.
Hey, you, the Police!
You're under arrest.
Let go of him...
Cuff them.
I read you your rights...
Book them and
have the place mopped up.
Looking for your man?
Too late.
I know it's terrible.
He'll be out
in a couple of years.
But he's dead!
And who's that over there?
I'm sure your man
has foreseen this eventuality.
He's known for generosity.
Now the reverse...
Freeze! Don't turn around!
I'm not.
Stick them up!
Drop your gun! Easy!
I've seen you somewhere.
Right!
I drove you the night
Guillotine got killed.
When I killed Guillotine,
I wanted to call it quits.
Nobody had ever seen me.
So I planted the gun
and tipped off Fish.
You never told me
you weren't Killer.
I did plenty of times.
- The man says you are!
- He says this or that.
I'm the real Killer.
You lived under my name?
And I give it to you,
you were doing fine.
But that's history now.
Mr. Real Mac Coy,
wait a minute!
That container holds
half a ton of dollars.
As much as Saudi Arabia's GNP.
Don't kill us, and we'll
give you all you want.
And you won't if I do?
Don't kill us and take all.
But it's my hard earned
money, mind you.
Open up!
- Where's the dough?
- I don't know!
My money,
thieves!
Drop it!
You'll never get away
again, Killer.
Fish?
Will you file for indemnity
from the police?
Our routine operation, as such,
posed no harm to Mr. Kiler.
And the invasión of privacy?
Ours wasn't a mistake
but a set up
to capture the real Killer.
The Polish criminal of the
millennium.
Is it true
that you were humiliated?
Humiliated?
What about the reward?
The police might benefit
more from it, I guess.
You crazy? You deserve it...
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's wrap it up.
Buy hi-tech equipment.
How generous of you, sir.
Give it to the orphans!
Fifty-fifty then.
I'll brief you on
the operation details.
Killer! Mr. Killer!
We're neighbors.
One tenant
is a pain in the neck.
Could you take care of him?
- We have a kitty, sir.
- I'll think about it.
Don't forget us pensioners!
You know what time it is?
- You Waldek?
- Sure.
I work strictly till 4 p.m.
You think I got
no other business?
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't think it'd take
that long.
It's the last time!
Take care.
What's this all about?
You've swapped the containers?
- What's in there?
- Give me a hand.
How much in all?
About half a ton.
Dollars?
In $100 bills.
You know how I feel?
As if I were dreaming,
only to wake up.
So do it.
I'm awake.
Dear God!
What do we do with it?
Don't worry.
We'll come up with something.
Jerzy Killer donated all the dough
to Polish film production.
And he lived to regret it...
