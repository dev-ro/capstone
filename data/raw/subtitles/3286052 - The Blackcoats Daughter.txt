Daddy...
You came early.
Daddy, where's the car?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Father Brian?
Sorry to disturb.
Yes... of course.
Come in, Katherine.
Sit down.
Thank you, Dawn.
Mr. Walsh tells me that your recital
is coming along very, very nicely.
I'm sorry that I won't
be around to see it.
But I'm sure that
you'll enjoy performing for your friends
and your parents
all the same, won't you?
Where are you going?
I have some personal business in Albany.
How long does it take to get to Albany?
Oh... a couple of hours
by train.
So, about the same exact time
to come back, then, I guess.
Katherine...
Are you concerned about something?
No.
I mean I just wish you could stay
and see my performance.
That's all.
Well, I'm sorry, but this time,
it just can't be helped.
When do you come back?
After the break
like everyone else, I should imagine.
Is something funny?
Funny?
No.
Why?
You smiled a little.
I did?
Yes.
You did.
Oh.
No.
I was just thinking to say
I hope you have a fun time in Albany.
Headache, you say?
Yeah...
And my throat kind of hurts
when I swallow.
You poor thing.
It would be a shame to be sick
over the break.
I know.
Here you are, dear.
So, you really think I should tell him?
Rose, of course you have to tell him.
It's like half his.
It's half his problem anyway.
No it isn't.
Not really.
Well, it should be.
He's the one that got you
into this situation
in the first place.
He knew exactly what he was doing.
Like I didn't?
He was doing it to me
and I was liking it.
Don't laugh.
It's so not funny.
Besides, it's only been four days.
I could still get it.
You think you're gonna
tell your parents?
Of course
everyone is excited
to have your parents come and
tour the classrooms and share your life
here at Bramford with them.
But that doesn't mean
there's gonna be any change
when it comes to conduct expectations.
If anything,
conduct is more important today
than any other day because
today we are all here
representing Bramford.
That means you are representing
all of the young women
who came before you
and all the young women
who will follow you
after you've moved on.
Sound good?
Sounds good.
And if I don't see you before you leave,
have a great week off
and we'll see you back on the 22nd.
Rose!
Where are you going?
I was just gonna check out
some of there performance.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Of course.
Where are your parents?
They're waiting inside,
so I'd better go.
Okay, well, I'll see you next week then.

Katherine, have you checked
your cellular phone?
Maybe they called there.
I don't have one yet.
They said maybe for my birthday.
Oh.
Well...
You know, bad weather coming in
all over the East Coast, and
maybe they got caught up in that.
Planes get delayed...
And Rose?
What about you?
I thought we got out on Friday,
so I told my parents to come on Friday.
Guess I spaced out.
Were you able to reach them?
Yeah.
It just may take a day or so
to change their plans.
A day...
Yeah, 'cause
they were planning on
coming on Friday, so they'll
probably still come on Friday.
Oh, well...
All right, well,
Ms. Prescott and Ms. Drake
will be here in any case.
Now, do you hear that, Katherine?
It happens that parents
get confused, and
worst case is they come on Friday
and everyone goes home and
has a really nice break anyway.
After all, we can't let you live here.
Rose...
Would you look after Kat
until her parents arrive?
I actually haven't been
feeling very well.
No?
I have a really sore throat.
I was gonna stay in bed.
Oh.
Well...
Uh, Ms. Prescott,
you will call Mr. Cornish in a few hours
both on his home phone
and his mobile, won't you?
Of course we will.
Sound good?
Katherine...
Sounds good.
Hey... Dad, uh...
It's me.
Just...
Just calling to see
where you and Mom are
and if you're coming.
I guess you can call the school.
Okay.
Bye.
Dear Lord, thank you for this meal
that you have placed
in front of us on this night...
You know I'm not babysitting
you tonight, right, freshman?
Mr. Gordon said you're
supposed to stay with me.
Yeah, but what's he gonna to do?
Bust me for not being at school
over vacation?
Mr. Gordon said...
"Mr. Gordon said.
Mr. Gordon said."
What are you, a freaking recording?
Where are you going?
Me?
Nowhere.
And if the Sisters say anything
just tell them I wasn't feeling well
so I'm staying in bed.
You do know about the Sisters,
don't you?
Know what?
You know they are wigs, right?
You know that they have no hair
on their bodies?
No hair anywhere?
Next time, check their eyebrows.
Totally fake.
The real ones
burnt right off.
That's not true.
You didn't hear
about Jen Darling's sister?
Graduated three years ago.
She walked in on them one night
worshiping the devil.
Yeah.
Who told you?
Don't come in my room, okay?
And don't touch my shit.
There's someone in here.
We're sorry, but the number
you have dialed
has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.
If you feel that you may have
reached this recording in error...
Hey... are you okay?
You can't be warm enough in that jacket.
Are you waiting for someone?
Can we give you a lift somewhere?
You've gotta be freezing.
Where're you heading?
We're gonna go get back out
on the highway,
and then we're gonna head east
a little while.
How 'bout you.
You heading someplace?
Portsmith.
Sure.
I know Portsmith.
I'm parked right over there.
My wife's waiting in the car.
See? Right there.
My name's Bill.
What's your name?
Joan.
My name's Joan.
Jone... Nice.
Nice name.
Bill... what are you doing?
Just trying to help.
Come on.
We'll take her to the next gas station.
I'm trying to help.
Call me later. Okay?
I don't have my phone.
So, that's it?
Stop saying that.
What am I supposed to say?
Nothing.
I'll take care of it.
Can you at least let me drive you there?
No. No way.
Be careful.
Okay?
Careful...
Yeah, right.
Idiot.
Sounds good.
Katherine?
Hello?
It's Bill
from the bus station.
Do you mind if I come in?
I just wanted to see how you're doing.
I see you're up, at least.
So...
I guess you were pretty
zonked out there, huh?
You slept for almost four hours
in the back seat.
I'm sorry.
For what?
First rule...
You don't apologize to me, young lady.
I'm happy to help. Okay?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Helping me so much.
Do you believe in God, Joan?
No.
No? Just like that?
No.
Ever tried to look for Him?
It's strange...
People think you look for Him
in some book
or in a church or a statue.
Maybe even a candle flame...
But that's not how it works for me.
I look for Him in the unlikely
things that happen.
Little coincidences.
And when I saw you sitting
at that bus station
you reminded me so much of someone.
Someone I haven't seen in a long time.
And then... when you said
you were going to Portsmith...
...well...
A coincidence like that,
I just can't ignore it.
So, strange as it may sound...
I guess I saw God in you.
Are you going to Portsmith, too?
No, not exactly.
Linda and I are headed
to the town just before it.
We're going to Bramford.
Do you know Bramford?
When do we leave?
What's that?
When do we leave?
What's your hurry?
Where's your wife?
She's sleeping.
Why?
Well...
Hopefully we can
get out of here
first thing in the morning.
I, uh...
Bet you're pretty hungry.
Well, there's a restaurant next door.
Why don't you get dressed and
come down and have some dinner?
Thank you.
Okay.
Do you know how much trouble
I could get into for this?
Do you need a towel?
So, what were you doing down there?
Were you sleepwalking?
Do you sleepwalk?
Is that what that was?
Hello?
Uh-huh.
What about your parents?
Did they call?
They're not going to call.
They just got confused.
Like your parents?
Mm-hmm.
But your parents didn't get confused.
You told them not to come
so you could go on a date.
It wasn't a date.
It wasn't?
- No, it wasn't.
- What was it?
It was nothing.
Mr. Gordon said you were
supposed to look after me.
I know what Mr. Gordon said.
Mr. Gordon said worst case
they'd be here by friday.
- Yeah, I know what he said.
- But now it's too late.
Too late for what?
They're dead.
What?
That is an awful thing to say.
You shouldn't say things like that.
You shouldn't say things like that.
Okay?
It's just not funny.
You smell pretty.
You should go to bed.
Just go to bed, and then when
you wake up in the morning,
you're gonna be okay.
All right?
They'll be here on Friday.
They're already on their way.
That's it.
Okay?
That's it.
You should go to bed now.
Is there anything else I can get you?
No.
You had your chance.
There she is.
Linda has a extra coat.
It's a lot warmer than yours
and she won't mind if you borrow it.
She's gonna be along any minute.
Thank you.
So, Portsmith, huh?
Is that your home?
Your mom and dad?
No.
No?
Friends? Someone?
Someone.
Well, that's better
than having no one, isn't it?
They changed the decor
of this place a few years ago.
Used to be more of a... kids place.
Famous for their chicken noodle soup.
That's how we came by it, anyway.
Linda and I used to spend a lot
of time here with our daughter.
Remember I told you that you,
uh, reminded me of somebody?
Well...
You reminded me of her.
My daughter.
She'd be right about your age by now.
We lost her nine years ago.
Nine years, uh... tomorrow, actually.
And it's okay.
We-we do okay.
It's difficult, but, uh...
You know what they say.
"Time heals all wounds".
And little by little,
it does get easier.
Except around this time of year
when we go and lay flowers
on the anniversary.
I've got a picture.
Here.
That's my Rose.
She's pretty.
Yes, she is.
Isn't she?
Have you decided?
Oh, uh...
Yes, I've decided.
Joan, have you decided?
Excuse me.
Oh, there you are.
Look, we've got some, uh,
really bad weather coming in over night,
and if we don't get on the road tonight
we're gonna be snowed in tomorrow,
maybe the day after.
They're gonna pack up our food for us.
So why don't you grab it
and meet me out front?
Okay?
Thank you.
What did he tell you?
Did he tell you about our daughter?
When he told you
about our daughter, he said...
"have"... didn't he?
We have a daughter.
Ve...
Ve...
He told you you remind him of her.
He actually said that to you, didn't he?
It's okay.
Poor thing.
Tries to say that to everyone.
Of course I never see it.
Of course it isn't true.
But...
Still sometimes I try.
I saw it once.
I was at the supermarket alone
and I was standing
in the middle of a long aisle,
all by myself,
when a girl came around the corner.
She was looking at a low shelf
for something.
She was about 15.
She had
her money held tightly in her hand
like children do.
I guess school had gone back already.
The weather had turned cold.
She was just in her
uniform skirt and
sneakers with no socks.
Her knees were pink
almost red from the cold.
But what did she know?
She had her hair in a ponytail
and I could see the roots
being pulled back from her ears.
You don't look anything like her.
It's strange.
I can't see you at all.
Okay.
Well, what did they say?
What did they say?
He said it's all right.
What's all right?
Who says?
He says I can't live here.
But I can... with him.
Who's "he"?
You know who.
No, I don't know.
Mr. Gordon...
...silly.
He's the headmaster.
Oh.
You smell pretty.
Dear Lord, thank you for this meal
that you have placed
in front of us on this day.
Katherine.
Yes, ma'am?
Is there something wrong?
No, ma'am.
In that case,
kindly repeat grace for the rest of us.
Dear Lord, um...
Thank you for this meal
that you have placed
in front of us that...
...and for which we are truly...
Katherine!
Oh, mercy!
Is she okay?
She's fine.
Did Mr. Gordon call?
Why on Earth would
the headmaster call here?
I dunno, to...
To say that they were all right?
Her parents.
Of course they are all right.
And Katherine is all right as well.
Thank you, Ms. Drake.
Here, drink this, dear.
Katherine?
Get your hands off me, cunt.
Ms. Drake... the telephone, please.
Certainly, dear.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You will look at me
when I am talking to you.
Ms. Prescott, a word, please.
He really did say he'd come.
He'll come and he'll say he as wrong.
This time he'll say that
I can live here.
He's the headmaster.
Rose, come out here, please.
I will kindly ask you to shovel
the path between the houses.
Shovel it down to the earth.
Me?
Why me?
What did I do?
She's the one who called you...
Mr. Gordon will be arriving
later this afternoon.
Mr. Gordon?
What happened?
Down to the earth... please.
Are you all right?
Uh, yes.
They should be over this way.
Huh.
Ms. Prescott!
Hello?
Mommy?
Dad?
Hi, baby girl.
Dad?
Katherine.
Who-who is it?
Hello?
They're not coming.
Kill... the cunts.
...they are wigs, right?
You know that they have
no hair on their bodies?
No hair anywhere?
Next time, check their eyebrows.
Totally fake.
The real ones
burnt right off.
You didn't hear
about Jen Darling's sister?
Graduated three years ago.
She walked in on them one night
worshiping the devil.
Hi.
You can stay here with me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Katherine?
Katherine?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Hey!
Hey, drop it!
Hey, h-hey!
Hey, dro... Hey, drop it.
D-drop it.
Drop the knife!
Drop the knife, God damn it!
This is your last warning!
I will shoot you!
Drop the knife!
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
I said drop the knife!
Did you tell her?
Did you tell her all about it?
Please, Linda.
When you meet these people,
do you say it?
Do you say that she was murdered?
Please!
No, you don't.
You don't say
that when she was found
they had to do a blood test
to see if her head matched the body.
- That's enough!
- Just focus on the road.
Don't touch me!
Can you please pull over?
Huh? What was that?
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Are you all right back there?
Please pull over.
All right.
Hold on.
Hold on.
No, please.
Just go past it.
- We're not stopping here.
- Hold on, hold on.
God damn it, Bill!
Don't stop here!
Okay.
Here we go.
Katherine?
Shh.
There you are.
You are not wanted here.
I say
you will go from this place.
You will leave here.
You will leave this poor girl
and you will never come back.
I command that you leave this place.
I command that you go out.
I command that you go out!
By the power of Christ I command you!
I command you to leave this girl
and never come back!
I command you to go out!
Don't go.
