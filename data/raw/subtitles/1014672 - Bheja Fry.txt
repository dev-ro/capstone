That's it?
What do you mean?
Is that enough?
Did you have a recording?
No I have one now!
Then why did you come here?
Why not!
At least I get to
see your face!
Keep looking'
Are you coming?
Come soon
Come..
Sweetheart I'll get late
You don't have a booking!
Stop honking!
Idiot!
Have you ever missed
a single Friday?
Stop the car David..
Stop the car please.
Park it on the side.
Keep going..
Park it outside
Where is everybody?
What happened to you?
What did you think? Kapoor
a businessman can't be creative?
This round is mine Ranjeet!
Your talent was a flop!
Prepare for the next round!
Will have to search..
You feel there is a dearth
of talent in India?
There's no dearth
You need someone
to find them.
Will get someone..will
get someone..
Can I get a window seat?
Go look for yourself
Excuse me..
do you mind sitting here?
I get very restless
without a window seat
..and there's no empty
window seat on the bus.
Please come.
Sir do you mind pulling
your seat ahead?
Sir why don't you push
your seat behind?
What do you mean..!?
Are you going to Pune?
This bus goes only up to Pune
I go once in every three
months to Pune.
The weather in Pune is
much better than Mumbai
especially for the body and mind.
And for artistes like me
it's very important.
Do not ask me how..
I passed the night away..
Do not ask me how..
I passed the night away..
Take a look..
Open it
Go on.. Take a look
I'll show you.. See this
All India District Level
Singing Festival
My first gold medal.
It was also my first
stage performance.
I got a gold medal.
I was only thirteen!
As soon as I stepped into
High School another achievement..
Let's go further..
I wasn't even employed since
then I have been doing Stage shows!
Are you a singer?
Well I don't like to
call myself that..
sounds like a sewing machine brand.
"Okay, okay.."
I am a vocalist and I
Have surrendered ..
..my life to the service of music.
Well I don't have any
guru as such but
I consider Naushad saab as my guru'
Sachin Dev Burman saab'
Shankar Jaikishan saab.. Khhayyam
saab..
And in today's generation..AR
Rehman..
Man is a voyager..
He comes and he goes'
On the road that he travels..
He leaves behind memories..
Are you getting it?
- What?
Network! - What?
In this journey of life..
travelers meet to get separated'
Leaving behind memories..
that plague them in solitude'
Who..
Ever belonged..
To anybody here..
Who ever belonged to anybody here..
Here..
Along with it the road took me'
Leaving behind my sky'
I met you again on these roads'
I wanted to tell you something..
But I didn't say a word'
Leave..
You had to leave'
To a place where you belong
to yourself'
Who..
ever belonged..
to anybody here..
Who ever belonged to anybody here..
My heart was mesmerized'
Everything stopped when
you touched'
But what's left are just scars
of memories'
Whatever I wished for..
It never happened'
Did not turn back and see..
Time just went by'
No no tell me..
Did not wait for anything..
At Spectral..
Mumbai Idol auditions are on..
you tell me..
Where is Jeet.
Come on it's only
Tuesday today!
Three more days to go you
don't worry!
Where are you from?
- I am from Jamshedpur sir.
Jamshedpur?
- Yes sir. - What do you do?
I am into theatre
and I also sing.
You sing too?
Please sing for me.
I will start from the verse.
- Sure.
It's an old song..
It's a story..
I do not remember'
Now that I think I
shall never forget'
The memories of that spring
Seasons come and go..
Giving false promises'
And yet my mind is thirsty
At least leave the kids alone.
You are looking for your talent
that too outside my studio!
Admits the singers audition line up?
I was listening to her sing!
It's not fair to poke fun at
someone's talent.
I wasn't making fun of anyone!
The moment we walk in he'll say
Didn't I tell you to buy two!
How's everything?
Well going on
Didn't I tell you to buy two?!
You had to come again!
What do you think?
You should've taken a smaller
car for Sheetal.
There will be a fight at home.
It's the days of equality you know!
Will take at least a week
For your party?
I met this man on my way to Pune'
I was going there for
my dad's concert..
Ya ya he does he is into Classical
.. and his singing never stops
I'm telling you show your
devotion to Sehwag's strength
Sehwag's strength doesn't
last when it comes to Pakistan
Have you forgotten when
he hit a triple century..
..you all spent an entire
month rubbing balm on your backsides!
Oh did you forget when Shoaib
nailed everyone..
they were running around the
field like dogs!
Oh that was a fluke!
You are one big fluke wanna-be
singer!
Transvestite!
Nudist!
One who's naked can
see everyone naked!
Get lost!
- You get lost!
Boil in the ass!
Broken Tanpura!
Pardon me. He makes me swear.
It's ok Mr. Bhushan I'm used to it!
I am calling from Soundman
Industries'
I would like to speak with Mr.
Bharat Bhushan please
Yes this is Bharat Bhushan.
Yes Mr. Ranjeet Thadani
One of my friends met you a
Mr. Jagdeesh Varma
Yes on the way to Pune
He was all praises for you..
..and.. In fact I would
like to meet you
Can you come to my house for
dinner next Friday?
Next Friday dinner..
..Veg or Non-veg?
The thing is.. at our place we
do not eat Non-veg on Fridays..
When I called him for dinner
do you know what he asked me?
Sir Veg or Non-veg?..
You called only one?
You think one is not enough?
He's like ten!
Ranjeet what happened?
Sheetal!
Slowly
Where should I put the ice
pack? Left or right?
What happened to your phone?
Its gone!
I've been trying for so long!
- The phone's gone and so has my back!
Good you are back at home now'
did it happen at the same time?
You know I have a dinner to attend
Nothing will happen to me in
one hour I will be alright.
So don't talk to me then.
Why are you talking?
Ms Sushma.. Yes..
Can I tell you something..
- Go on..
I'm very nervous!
There's no reason for you to
be nervous Mr. Bhushan!
You know I've never been
invited to such a dinner before.
Really?
- Yes
Can you tell me something?
Go on
What do you think of
my new hair style?
No?
I felt similarly.
It's better to be simple.
Of course of course..
Don't be nervous..
But why did you call him here?
Just like that..
Let me see what Bharat Bhushan
is made off!
Half an hour early
He has a very important
dinner to attend.
No there's no dinner..
Oh ya! It's not a dinner..
Actually it's a talent
hunt party? Isn't it?
They call some idiot for dinner..
Is there a shortage of the
intelligent in India?
Calling some fool and
making fun of him..
They don't even know they are
being made fun of!
But you are aware of
it aren't you?!
Anyways I don't have
a cure for this
Unfortunately I don't
have one either!
Do you remember back in
college when we celebrated
rose days we used to make the
ugliest girl Rose Queen!
That I will know only after I go.
Sheetal!
Where do you manage to
meet such samples?
There's no shortage of talent
in India doctor
3rd LV or may be 4th LV
or may be 5th LV..
I think you should
cancel the dinner
Take some rest tonight I'll
come back tomorrow morning
By the way what
does your sample do?
You have called and I am away'
leave a message after the beep'.
I'll come back and return your call'
oh leave a message after the beep..
Mr Bharat Bhushan where are you?
I am waiting for you.
Please come soon
Here 80 rupees..
Mr. Thadani's residence? Yes
I have been called.
This sample of yours is amazing!
I think he's come'
No you sit I'll receive him.
You take care of your back I'll
take care of him
The whole and soul of Soundman
Industries..
I know everything about
your company..
New age music Super hit Muqabale
Deewarien..
Your getting me wrong'
Actually my father was a very big
fan of Bharat Bhushan.
What?
Rani Rupmati was his first
romantic picture.
The actor -Bharat Bhushan's not
my father!
That is why he named
me Bharat Bhushan.
Yes. - I have inherited music.
That is why I feel I should
justify my name fully. - Yes
Have you heard that song?
- Which one?
Oh! Come back'.
Come back..
Come back..
Yes yes now please come in.
There is someone else who is
waiting to hear your song
I think you didn't
like my song
No it doesn't matter
if I like it or not.
It all depends on him..
Oh Ganpati!
It is your greatness
that you give credit
for your hard work
to Lord Ganesha
Lord Ganesha?
Please wait here I'll
be back in a minute
Your sample is remarkable!
I told you so!
By the way what does he do?
He's an officer
with the government.
You called an I.T.
guy to your house?
Not an I.T. guy an idiot doctor!
Softly.. He's standing right there..
And ya never invite me for a
dinner! I'll keep wondering!
Ranjeet take care of your back..
Ranjeet Thadani is waiting for you'
Oh I'm sorry I made you listen
to my story for no rhyme or reason!
It's okay!
How is his mood?
Well you sing something for him
everything will be okay!
Come in.. come in
I'm sorry I cannot stand up. My
back has betrayed me.
I think we will have to
cancel the dinner..
No its not a problem
If you have a life
the world is yours
We shall have fifty
more opportunities for a dinner
Yes but when will I get a
chance to have dinner with you?
You are embarrassing a worthless
one like me!
Whenever you call
me I'll be there.
T.G.I.F. means?
Are you coming?
And you talent?
He's right here in front of me.
- How is he? Winning horse?
You come here we'll
treat your back here!
So..
You've had formal training
in music or ..just like that?
Training is required by those who
don't have it in them.
Music flows through my veins.
Gandharva Mahavidyalay's foundation
happened right in front
of my father's eyes.
But because of some
economic pressures
he could not take
up admission there
he started working
there as a clerk.
Well forget it..
If my father wasn't a clerk in
Gandharva Mahavidyalay
I would have never
become a vocalist.
But I'd not only like to sing well
but listen to some good music too.
Not just the great singer
Tansen but Kansen too!
I carry mine along with me!
Mr. Bhushan today leave
aside the country ..
..stuff and have some
imported stuff.
You have got it all wrong
This sure is country stuff but
it's not liquor it's honey.
Enriches the throat.
I heard the message on your
answering machine.
You liked it?
- A lot!
I'll do one for you!
I have two
brilliant ideas.
Give it to me
- I don't want it.
You don't understand!
I'll show you one more
very good thing.
What is this?
My story expressed through the
words of music and songs.
I'll show you.
It is combined with
seven tunes..
..this Bharat Bhushan has sacrificed
his whole life in the way of music.
Mr. Bharat Bhushan
are you married?
I've walked alone
I will walk alone O ..
..fellow travelers
do not accompany me
So you haven't
been married yet.
Yes and no
- What do you mean yes and no'?
My wife deserted me.
That happens often
She went away with
that eunuch Nalla.
His name is Rajeev Bhalla
but we used to call
him Nalla Nalla.
Absolute fake he was.
He calls himself a singer but he
sings only those remix songs!
How could Indu'
Indu. - Your wife?
Yes she'll regret it.
Do you have this
Bhalla's number?
Why?
You want to listen to
those remixes? - No..
Oh he'll curdle everything up!
But its ok.. - I'll give you Nalla
I mean Rajeev Bhalla's number.
Then you'll realise who is
the real singer and who is fake!
You've felt bad Mr Bhushan..
No there is nothing
to feel bad about.
You are a connoisseur
of music right?
Tell me how many times does will
come' come in will come'?
That song from the film Mahal..
will come.. will come..'
How many times does it repeat?
Twenty eight times..
But what about your back?
Forget the back lets go!
- Let's go Lets go..
While I was walking'
I happened to meet somebody'
On the road'
Do you know in the film
Pakeeza the song walking walking'..
how many times the word walking'
has been used?
'walking walking' that's two..
That means the chorus itself has ..
Are you okay?
Should I call Pareshbhai?
He has magic in his hands.
There is no one in the
whole of Andheri ..
..who does a massage like he does.
My mother had a fall in the bathroom
for one month she was bed ridden..
but because of him within a day
she was walking like before!
You are underestimating Paresh bhai.
Look at yourself anything
can happen.
You can get paralysed you
can also die!
Pick up..
Pick up..
Pick me up not the phone you idiot!
Your message is very cold!
Its me Jeet.
I'm not coming home tonight
So don't try and look for me.
And my phone is switched off
In fact Jeet I don't
want to come home ever.
I think I should go now
I understand what you
are going through
I am not going through anything!
I just want to be alone for a while.
I said the same thing..
when Indu left me two years ago.
I want be be alone'.
Since two years I have
been living alone in suffocation.
See Sheetal is angry now okay.
Once she cools down she'll
come back home.
You please go home now.
Should I call Paresh bhai?
Ok call..
The number is in the phone book
This one?
Got it?
Yes got it..
I got it.
I'm calling from Ranjeet
Thadani's residence.
Who's speaking?
What happened?
It's some lady doctor.
He's writhing in pain
he can't even move!
Whom are you talking to?
And his wife is also not here too!
Where has his wife gone?
She left him
Left him?
What do you mean by 'left him?'
Both his back and his
heart are broken.
It's some doctor Suman Rao.
Hang up!
I'm sorry I think I dialed the
wrong number by mistake.
What happened to Ranjeet?
Hang up Please!
Hang up!
She said she's coming
and hung up.
Are you mad?!
Why did you call Suman Rao?
I made a mistake. Suman and Shephard
were on the same page!
Don't you know how to read!
On the same page' it seems!
- But both of them are doctors.
..what difference does it make?
What kind of doctors are
nymphomaniacs?
They are not doctors but
patients..
They are sick they are mad..
They are wantons! Got it?
Now what should we do?
- Call her back.
Tell her Sheetal is back..
my back is alright..
There's no need to come.
That should be fine.
I'll sit next to you
and call her up.
Ms Suman I am Bharat Bhushan
calling from Ranjeet Thadani's residence
What happened?
Nothing's happened. Everything is
alright under control.
His wife is back and
his back is alright.
And he is walking comfortably.
There's no need to worry.
Anyways worry is like
a funeral pyre!
Enough
- Chitra means?
Funeral Pyre
Hang up!
No I'm a singer.
Well songs and philosophy have
a very old relationship! -
What do you sing?
Everything..
classical semi-classical qawalli ..
..ghazal nazm birthday parties.
Hang up!
- What do you want to hear?
Anything will do - Okay here
it goes.. only for you..
your sorrows are mine..
Mr. Bhushan she doesn't want to
listen to your songs!
my joys are yours..
Hang up please! She
is asking me to sing!
those eyes of yours..
The moon and the
sun are mine..
Please hang up!
Hang up now!!
See I have to go now..
I can't leave him alone in
this state. He's in a lot of pain.
Alone?
You just said..
that his wife was back home?
His wife..
She's right here..
she's just gone out to put the garbage.
What nonsense are you talking?
- One has to put the garbage away
The cleanliness of the
nation starts with the house..
You're lying!
Excuse me I never lie.
I am a Libran and Libran's
do not lie.
Mahatma Gandhi was a Libran too.
2nd October Gandhi's
birth anniversary
I'm coming right away!
I'm coming right now she
said that and hung up.
Whom are you trying to deceive?
Yourself?
Talk clearly.. whatever
you want to say.
She's not coming back..
You're still here! You
haven't left yet!
No..
How long will you rest like this?
Can I put you somewhere else?
Come..
Absolutely
They all are the same.
Change colours like chameleons!
I heard your conversation.
She's left you and gone?
This Anant.. was he your friend?
When you asked me about my wife
I told you everything
right up to the name of that
& Nalla.
Anant was my friend
What do you mean was'?
We had a fight about two years ago
He was hitting on your wife?
I stole Sheetal from him.
I didn't understand.
He came to me with
an idea of an album
to launch a new singer.
I didn't take the album..
I took the singer Sheetal
Now I get it one button
but two holes?
I thought you got the whole shirt.
Why don't you call him?
What do I ask him?
Ask him for your shirt back!
That's what I told Nalla!
I asked him if he had my shirt..
He said I don't have your shirt
but I have your wife and he hung up.
..two years ago I stole
your wife did you steal her back?
Should I call?
I'll say I'm a friend
of Mrs Thadani
I just want to talk to
her for two minutes.
As you wish
Yes.
Will you do as I tell you?
I will only do what I'm told!
Sometimes I feel you think I'm an idiot!
So you call him and tell him you
are a film producer..
and you want the rights to his
album Jantar Mantar'
Pass me the phone
While talking you ask
him about the singer.
Now what does the singer have to
Do with the rights of the album?
Please go ahead..
So you tell him you want rights
to all the songs in Jantar Mantar
All songs of Jantar Mantar'
By the way how are
the all the songs?
Very bad Mr. Bhushan ..
Mr. Thadani if the
songs are very bad
what is the point of
taking rights to such songs?
If you want to buy the rights why
don't you try Madan Mohan's songs?
Of course not!
Do you really want the
rights to the album?
You're right..
when I don't want the rights why
simply waste time!
Lets not call him!
Now who is Sheetal?
Give me the phone I'll
dial the number
This is going to be fun!
Don't mess it up now
Can I change my voice and talk?
No need!
His name is Anant..Anant Ghoshal
Don't you worry..
Anant's end is near!
By hook or crook extract
all information..
of Sheetal Agarwal from him.
Your wife is kayasth'?
U.P. or M.P.?
Indu was kayasth' too!
Am I speaking to Mr. Anant Ghoshal?
I am Madan Mohan from Patna Bihar.
I am a Bhojpuri film producer.
We want your album..
Jantar Mantar's rights
Stop around with me.
I know who you are
I don't even know you..
how would I recognize you?
Come on
Talk in your own voice
Otherwise I'll..
Otherwise?
I know its you Toto
Mr. Ghoshal you have got me wrong
I am telling the truth..
I am not Toto.
I am Madan Mohan from Bihar
District Babua Bhojpur city.
What is the name of your company?
Company is New Trends Productions
You want to buy my songs
from the album?
Each and every one of them
Have you heard the songs?
If I hadn't heard them would
I be calling you?
What nonsense are you talking?
Movie or TV?
Oh movie the film will be shown
on big 75 mm screens all over Bihar.
On whom will the songs
be picturised?
It's a family picture..
My Sister-in-law and Your Wife'
Theres Ravi Kissen Nagma
and Rahul Roy in it.
I need to read the script.
You want to read it?
If you want I can narrate it
to you right now
No no not now..
Ask him about Sheetal..
I mean Madan Gopal Mohan
Okay so we shall talk tomorrow.
All the rights are ours Mr. Thadani!
And Sheetal?
My wife?
What happened to your wife?
You didn't ask him about
my wife at all!
I'll call again and say I want..
the contact number of
the singer Sheetal.
Mr. Thadani our goal is very near .
please don't be stubborn.
I'm being stubborn? Am I the idiot?
It was some Gopal Mohan' I've
never heard of him
One minute..
I'm Madan Mohan speaking.
Yes Mr. Madan Mohan.
It's not a problem..
actually I'm on another call.
Can I call you back?
Can I have your number?
Yes.. Please write
Strange! He cut the call!
I cut it. Are you mad!
You gave him my number!
He said he'll call back.
Your head is full of shit?!
It's music sir not shit!
Didn't I tell you he'll call back.
You should get an award for this!
Why are you not answering? It's
Anant on the line.
Didn't I tell you so!
What will you get out of lying to me
that too in Bhojpuri?!
Ask whatever you want in Hindi
You wanted to find out where
Sheetal is right?
Don't play games with me.
You're not that evolved
Did she say anything?
..that she won't come back.
Thank God! At least
she left a message..
I waited for two years!
Did she tell you anything?
She had called..
She said she was very upset.
Feeling bad?
I'm feeling bad and I'm in pain.
Look Ranjeet I didn't let
..will you tell me?
Yes
I'm writing that I've
taken sedatives and I'm asleep.
Please do not disturb.
Please put this on the door
on your way out.
Yes
You will remain here all night?
Higher.. higher..
Hope Lord Ram makes it happen'
That my sleep comes to you'
I stay awake'
Libran?
I spoke to you over the phone'
I'd called you instead of
calling the doctor
I sang for you too.. Don't
you remember?
Your sorrows now are mine..
You didn't recognize me?
Okay no problem.
I know who you are.
He told me everything about you
Only for a few more days..
After that it's all clear for you
His wife just left him and went away
Okay
I'll talk to him myself.
Can I advise you on something?
Go ahead..
I think.. you should leave
him alone tonight.
You'll see him tomorrow
at you door step wagging his tail.
You have some importance too!
Let him realize that.
One more thing..
don't meet 3-4 times a week.
Just meet once a week.
So he told you he meets me..
three to four times a week?
Oh forget about what he said.
If you take my advise..
he'll meet you everyday with an
orange carnation..
and you'll say'
Don't hit me with these marigolds..
Were you supposed to go
for dinner tonight?
Yes I was supposed to go..
But how did you know that?
I didn't tell you about it.
I'm sure he told you himself.
What did he say?
You're not sleeping yet?
You're not gone yet?!
Forget the questions first
congratulate me.
Thank me.
- Why?
Mr. Thadani you're not
only lucky with money
you're lucky to have
a friend like me.
What did you do now?
She was here!
- Who?
That woman your wanton!
Bharat Bhushan drove her away!
You drove Suman Rao away?
Just cannot happen!
I swear on Tansen' God
won't make me lie
She won't pile on you.
By the way she's quite pretty.
But she sings very badly.
She's a singer too?
You copulate with all
your singers?
My father used to say
a man's real honour is
in his integrity..
in his power of control.
How much ever you try and
control your mind
your concentration gets that
much better.
You'll have success in work..
respect in society.
Gautam Buddha said that.
But it has been followed only by
my father and me.
Besides Indumati I never even
looked at another woman.
Oh Mind why don't you
hold on to your reins!
Saint Bharat Bhushan..
Good Night!
I'll get that.
I thought you were alone.
- This is..
He was alone but I didn't let
him feel that way.
I spoke to you over the phone'
when I called for the rights of
Jantar Mantar..
District Babua..Bhojpur city.. Toto!
You were about to leave Mr. Bhushan?
I have some bad news.
She called..
- Sheetal?
Yes Sheetal she came here and..
Here? She didn't come here!
She wasn't here? No
Anyway I don't know where she
went but right now..
she's on her way to
Keval Arora's house.
What's wrong with her?
He will take advantage of her
on the pretext of being her
emotional support.
And what did you do?
Anant I married her!
You're still here?
Well yes yes I..
What yes yes I?
Do whatever you want to do at home!
He's one big bastard that
Keval Arora!
May be that's why she's
going there..
to put you down.
Bhalla was a big fraud too!
Mr. Bhushan I'm sick of
listening to your nonsense.
Please get out!
Do you know where he lives?
Who Bhalla?
How will I know where he stays?
Nobody knows
Just give it.
Her phone is unreachable.
Keval Arora pirated DVD racket
His house was raided recently.
His file is right on top at the
Income Tax Office.
My friend is handling his case.
He knows Keval Arora
He claims to know RD Burman also!
his friend..
Look my name is..
I know..
You are not getting it..
I am not getting it?
First explain it to him!
Such deeds will never bear fruit!
When He strikes there is no sound!
Who?
Oh right!
Now please come..
Come..
Sometimes on this foot..
Sometimes on that foot..
Constantly chained..
Am I'
Like anklets'
You sing so well!
Can I show you something?
Yes yes show me..
Have a look
What is this?

Expressed in music and songs
Has Ranjeet seen this?
Yes
Yes but how would he know..
how it feels when
pieces of broken
glass pierce through the heart
Thank you friend
Lets go in?
The story of Mr.Bhushan
expressed in music and songs!
Do you know how many songs
are in there?
How many?
Three hundred?
Four hundred?
Five hundred?
One thousand seven hundred
and thirty three
Twenty-seven of which have not
been released as yet!
Haven't been released? Then
how did you get them?
I was a regular at Anand
Bakshi's house.
I was like a son to him.
You can say up to AR Rahman
What were you saying about
Keval Arora?
When was I saying anything?
He was talking I
was just listening!
Do you know him?
Who doesn't know him? The
world knows him.
Pirated DVD scam it
was in the papers.
But do you know him personally?
My friend knows him..
He is handling his case at the
income tax department
Now?
What do you know about
Raag Shivranjini?
O Basanti..
Pure and mad..
Don't go.. don't go..
Someone stop her'
No one knows'
Where did those days go'
In the shadow of your memory
I would say'
I'm ready to surrender my vision
Friend no longer is a friend..
Love no longer remained a love..
Raj Kapoor was very
fond of Shivranjini
Can we call Asif Khan?
But it's not possible today.
It's difficult.
Why?
India and Pakistan are
playing a match..
He wont budge from the TV
Why don't you just call
me Mr. Pollution?!
But first I have to check the score.
Only then I can call
him with an excuse..
..to talk about the match.
Where is the TV?
- Come with me
This TV is really big.
Six.. Almost..
Asif Merchant is going
to get it today!
This guy is too much!
You were going to..
I got stuck!
He was your dinner talent? Him?
You find this funny?
Sehwag hit a six!!
God makes a pair' One
blind one leper'
Only two balls to go..
One more ball..
Oh you are back!
Hello Mrs. Thadani.
Whom did you send away?
Whom did you send away?
She had light eyes short hair?
Oh so there's someone else too!?
You sent her away?
But you were the one who told me..
if the wanton comes not to
allow her inside.
What did you tell her?
- Whom?
My wife! That was Sheetal!
Nothing
- What is a wanton?
She came home and you
drove her away?
I didn't know she wasn't
the wanton and this one was!
What is a wanton?
Later later' why don't
you tell me clearly
that you don't want me anymore?
Because of you ..
I turned down Keval
Arora's music video
Because of you ..
I've left both my dogs in the
car without the AC
Suman please leave before this
rising water suffocates me
Water will rise over your head
and I hope you drown in it!
But before I leave tell
me one thing..
Had fun?
Are you happy now?
This what you wanted? Right?
Are you a translator or something?
Are you here to impart
your education to everyone?
To err is human
You're human? You're an idiot!
Aren't idiots humans
too Mr. Thadani?
He is trying to help us
Us? Help us?
Ok! He was trying to help you!
Please call Asif
Look my name is Bharat Bhushan.
For me you are no less than
Madan Mohan..
those songs that conviction!
I'm only doing this for you.
- Go ahead
First ask him to tell me.
Ranjeet tell him..
Please say something..
Think about Sheetal..
Think about Keval Arora..
waves of the sea..cool breeze..
The Jacuzzi with Keval
and Sheetal..
It is ringing.
Asif this is Bhushan
Bharat your Dhoni was washed
out by the Pakistanis..
I'm watching the match too there
are lots of overs left..
When they could not do anything
in 43 overs what can they do now?
Have you forgotten about the
Multan one day?
So badly were you uprooted
that you are still holding it in your hand.
Get lost!
You get lost!
Eats in this land
sings of that land!
What a character! I know!-
I've been tolerating
him all evening!
You hung up?
I'll call him again.
Don't worry. We fight
all the time..
but we are best friends.
We can die for each other.
Put the speaker phone on please
Redial.
Asif listen to me carefully
There are just six over left.
What has your Bhajji uprooted?
Forget the match man. I had some
important work .
On one condition..
"Say Rahul Dravid down, down."
India bye bye
Have you lost your mind? Never!
In that case get lost
Please say it..
What happened? Caught in
a religious dilemma?
I'm only doing this for you
Ranjeet Thadani.
India hai hai Rahul Dravid bye bye
You actually said it!
Is everything okay?
Something very important..
You are handling Keval Arora's
case right?
Who? That music guy?
I need his address
I gave you Ravindra Jain's
address you got kicked out of there!
Ravindra Jain is blind. He
doesn't know what real talent is.
Blind? Even a deaf man would
throw you out after listening to you sing
Stop fooling around my friend's
wife is with Keval Arora!
Your friend's wife is with him?
She's not going to come back
as she was!
Why are you talking
nonsense? Just give me the address!
It's at the office.
I'll get it tomorrow.
I need it today. It's
very important.
Get it today please Asif!
I just got home!
The office is shut.
We'll record it
We'll record the match for you.
I haven't even eaten my dinner.
I thought after Pakistan wins
I'll eat in peace.
Come here! We'll order something
for you.
No no.. no..
You come here soon. Okay see you.
We won Mr. Thadani! We won!
He's the most honest
tax inspector of my department.
For the first time he's taking a
bribe.. Only for me
He's my friend after all.
He can look at a person's
face and tell how much money he has!
You called a tax inspector home..
Congratulations!
Ashish Rajender.
Majumdar.
Jogain Choudhary.
Manjith Bawa.
Manjith Bawa.
29 lacs only for this one!
Have you declared them?
You both are still here?
Don't you want to order food for Asif?
Yes we have to order food
He is your best friend right?
He is the best.
So he won't come here and
inspect the house right?
You are strange.
One day he ordered a raid
into his own house.
But when are we going
to order food?
Asif likes pizza?
A lot.
And you?
More than that.
Please order a vegetarian
one for me.
I don't eat non veg on Fridays
Can you ask for extra cheese for me?
Its something else to
have extra cheese ..
..but these guys are not generous.
Can you ask for some extra
tissues. They don't give enough'
Once I had sent one of them back
to get the tissues
I had asked for extra cheese..
Tell him to write it down else
he'll forget it later.
These days they don't
give anything free! Cheats!
Ask them about the time offer
so that we can..
Claim for the free pizza.. Last month
Sheetal's left you and gone..
but I feel more sorry to see
you at his mercy.
You should get the Padmabhushan
for this!
My name is Bharat Bhushan! How
many times have I told you?!
You should remember by now.
Oh I couldn't find it..
What?
Black pepper?
Oh there it is.
Do you have brown bread at home?
Asif is very diet conscious
these days.
Move..
It will be better if it's toasted.
Some cheese also please
Anything else?
No nothing.
I forgot the salt inside.
Looks like he is not used to
doing household work!
Beer?
No sir. My father used to say
beer is the younger..
.. sister of alcohol and every bad
deed begins with a baby step.
If I have beer it will lead
me to a beer bar..
From a beer bar to a dance bar..
Asif drinks?
No he doesn't drink
when he is on duty
What duty does he have here?
You don't get it.
He considers my work
no less than a duty.
Looks like Asif is here.
I'll get it I'll get it.
Asif.
Asif my brother!
What brother?!
You made me open the office at night ..
..climb seven floors without a lift.
I'll thank you sometime later
come in for now
Come on in.
Meet him this is Mr..
First tell me what happened?
What's there to happen? His wife
is not back yet that's why..
Shoot the wife!
What happened to the match?
Match is over! India won!
First meet him this
is Mr. Ranjeet Thadani
And this is his very good friend
Mr. Anant Ghoshal
This is your house?
Yes.
Why?
India could not have won!
You missed the last over!
Irfan hit 11 runs in 5 balls!
You can watch the
highlights tomorrow
Highlight.
You didn't record the match?
How would I know that after
Pakistan lost..
you would still watch the match?
You said you would record
it that's why I left the house
Last time Pakistan lost you
cried for three days!
You please come.
Please come.
You are too much.
- Just one plate?
Do you eat cheese?
Your omelet is coming
Am I the only one eating?
We have eaten we were
just waiting for you.
Very nice'
"Take this, have it. - Wonderful."
Thadani.
I'd audited one Anil Thadani.
Do you know him?
May be.
Where does he live?
In jail!
His had a similar house in Juhu..
..he used to play the stock
exchange game.
What's your game?
I told you earlier he
has a music company'
There's a lot of money in this
music company game
Will you give the address please?
Too good! Who made it?
Mr. Thadani made it but
the recipe is ours..
..onion garlic and coriander
paste which he made fresh..
with a little pepper
and a little honey.
D 5
Hold on..
do you have the registry papers
of this house?
This house has been made
on reclaimed land..
do you have the power of attorney?
I'd told you earlier he's the
best inspector of our department!
He takes one look at the face
and knows how deep the pockets are!
He's come here to help us
or to raid the house?
Why do you doubt them? They
are good people!
They even heard my story' in
music and songs
Really Mr. Thadani?-Yes.
Tell them..
In that case I have to give
it only for you Bharat Bhushan!
Write it'
D 531.
"Shanti Sadan, Juhu scheme."
Thank you very much.
Wait..
Just wait! At least find out
if he's there at home or not.
He'll kick you out!
We got the address right? Get
these clowns out of here!
At least call him up.
Firstly I shall disconnect the
phone and throw it out of the house
Let's call him first on someone
else's name
He's on a flight to Canada tonight.
We'll say we are calling from
Anil Grover's office..
..and Ranjeet Thadani knows
his wife is with you.
But he will recognize my voice..
You..
Mine too..
He knows my voice too..
Now don't tell me I have to call!
Have we lost our minds that
we are going to ask you to call?!
Yes you have lost it'
So should I call?
"Hey, I'll teach him."
He can't learn a thing!
If you don't like my style
you can say no.
Say you're calling from
Anil Grover's office..
Perfect.
What perfect?
Did you understand?
What is there to understand?
Look Mr. Bhushan let's
do a small rehearsal.
You are calling from Anil
Grover's office and he has left for Canada.
I'm speaking from Anil
Grover's office and he has left for Canada.
And Ranjeet Thadani knows that
his wife is with you..
And if you do not send her
back then there might be blood shed!
Wow! Bhushan! No one at
the office knows about your talents.
How was it Mr. Thadani?-
Should I change my voice and say..
if you don't send her back..
Do as you are told!
Asif can we have the number?
If I can get something to drink
after the omelet..
26057 482
Now it's time for fun!
Why is he not answering?
He must be busy!
"Hello, hello."
I am speaking from Anil
Grover's office.
Before he left for Canada he
asked me to tell you something..
Poor guy sounds exhausted!
Ranjeet Thadani knows..
that his wife is with you.
Grover knows I am with Sabina
Merchant the tax inspector's wife!
Who are you?
Asif my brother!
Bhushan' your sister-in-law?
Redial.
This is Asif Merchant speaking.
Listen to me carefully.
Tomorrow I am coming
to your house ..
..with three officers
for a final audit.
Be ready..
Give the phone to Sabina'
Make her speak to me
I know she is there give it to her.
Sabina.
If your friend's kid's
birthday party is over come home.
I'm going to sleep in the kids room.
Malti has kept food on the table..
..if you don't want to eat
it keep it in the fridge.
There's no need to be sorry.
Anil Thadani is your relative..
You don't know that but I do.
Next week there will
be a tax audit..
Be ready!
Good night.
Asif I'll drop you outside.
Don't worry I won't answer it'
I've cleared the table I'm
leaving now.
Hospital.. Is everything alright?
Should I come with you?
For your information I
used to drive the ..
..jeep in my colony since I was'
Do you have a license?
Yes
Wait for two minutes' I'm coming
If you don't answer I will..
Ms. Suman Rao are you okay?
I was just making some milkshake.
Okay.
Look his wife met
with an accident..
..he's gone to the hospital.
Accident?
Yes.
Serious?
Well if it's an accident it
has to be serious.
Keep the phone down Mr.Bhushan?
Don't talk like that'
Why not?
Lying runs in his blood.
Why me he will not be happy
with any other girl.
Ms. Suman Rao have
faith in yourself
And can I say something?
Mr. Thadani might never
be able to tell you..
..but he loves his wife a lot.
She's going to commit suicide.
She's blackmailing you you donkey!
He only sees his advantage..
and for his happiness he
can hurt anyone..
he will play with anyone's emotions.
Don't you know?
Talent party?
Every Friday he calls one
person home to poke fun at him.
That poor guy doesn't even
know he's being made fun of.
You and Suman are becoming
good friends?
Come' on we are getting late.
We'll talk in the car. Let's go.
Why me?
You chose me for this dinner
because I'm emotional?
I'm sensitive?
Because I have a desire to
do something?
Because I'm a fool?
My father used to tell me..
No..
From now I won't
tell you anything
You are being sentimental
for no reason.
You are still lying to me.
Suman was right..
You are not a good man..
I'm not a good man!
Mr Thadani number one bastard!
There's no need to come.
That's why I called.
I know everything
About that Suman.
Why are you
drinking so much?
Why not?
The story is over!
Ranjeet Thadani's pride has
been broken..
Everyone has left him and gone..
and now Bharat Bhushan
is leaving him too.
All night he will be lying
drunk on the floor.
He got what he deserves.
I am going to call
Lilavati Hospital right now.
I shall get you the last chance.
There's one Mrs. Sheetal
Thadani who has had an accident.
Can I speak to her?
To talk to a patient you have
to call before six
But it's still not six yet.
It is very important..
Dr. Shepard she is not
letting me speak.
What?
One minute madam..
Hello this is Dr. Shephard.
Can I speak to Sheetal Thadani?
In matters of life and death..
sorry' and please' will not work.
I'm Bharat Bhushan.
Your husband's dinner game idiot.
I met you at your door.
All this has happened
because of me.
Mr. Thadani is to blame too..
But I'm a partner in this crime too
Now look..
Look Mrs. Sheetal..
Mr. Thadani is ashamed
of what he did.
Whatever you may call him..
good or bad..
He's selfish he's mean..
that he is..
But right now he's very sad.
That is only because you
are not with him.
My father used to say that..
if you want to go away you must..
go away from sin not
from the sinner.
My wife left me two years ago.
I am still waiting for
her to come back.
I'm heart broken..
but I cannot forget her.
I know he is sitting next to you..
and he's asking you to say all this.
No..
Mrs. Sheetal I..
I am calling from a public booth
Mr. Bhushan you don't know Ranjeet
He only thinks about himself.
I have been with him since the
past two hours.
He is suffering in your thoughts..
..and is desperate to meet you.
And he got so anxious that he
called Keval Arora..
What?
He called Keval Arora?
You have no idea what he has gone
through to get to you.
He threw Suman Rao
out of the house..
He made up with Anant Ghoshal..
and he also called a
tax inspector home..
just to know where you are.
And now he is depressed
he's alone..
and in sometime he is
going to be drunk..
..and will pass out on the floor.
Mrs. Sheetal.
I have only heard of people
dying in love
but I think I am going to see
it for the first time.
She will definitely call back!
Mr. Bhushan if you want..
you can take me out for
a dinner anytime.
I'll surely come along
as your idiot.
But I want you to promise
me something..
Henceforth..
never call anybody an idiot!
This is Bharat Bhushan
Weren't you at a PCO just now?
No.. no..
