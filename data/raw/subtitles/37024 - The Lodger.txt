It was the Ripper all right.

[Woman #2] They onlyjust found her.
[Man] Isn't it awful, what's happenin'.
It's hardly more than a week since the last.
[Screaming] I saw 'im!
I saw the Ripper. He
ran down the other alley.
- It must be him.
- Did you see his face?
No. Not in the dark.
Like a shadow he was.
She's the fourth he's done 'round here.
Right in the streets...
under your very noses.
[Horse Hooves Clattering]

Special edition! Extra! Special edition!
Lord love me! They've seen

- Aye, boy! Paper.
Murder in Whitechapel!
[Newsboys Continue Shouting, Indistinct]
Murder in Whitechapel! Read all about it!
- Here, boy!
- Murder in Whitecha... Thank you, governor.
Jack the Ripper still at large!
Read all about it! [Continues
Shouting, Indistinct]
Paper, sir?
Jack the Ripper still at
large! Read all about it!
Amazing. Another murder in the same
district committed in the same way.
Throat cut from behind. Extraordinary.
- You have rooms to let?
- Hmm?
I saw your advertisement, and the
estate agents gave me this order to view.
Well, you better come in.
We don't really make a habit
of letting rooms, you know.
It just so happens, at the moment, we
might be able to accommodate someone.
I'll call my wife.
- Ellen.
- Yes, darling?
This gentleman has come
about the, uh, advertisement.
- Oh. How do you do?
- How do you do?
The rooms are upstairs, Mr., uh...
My name is Slade.
Slade? How odd.
We have a Slade Walk at the
corner of the square here.
Now, if you'll come this way.
Here we are.
My Aunt Sophie occupied this
part of the house before she died.
I'm sure you'll be very comfortable here.
- This is the bedroom.
- These are the only rooms you have?
I'm afraid so.
- There are the attics of course.
- Attics?
Mi-Might I see them?
Why, they're not very well
furnished, but if you wish.
[Chuckles] Those are old-time actresses.
Quaint, aren't they? [Chuckling]
My aunt's maid used these
attics. This one is quite empty.
This one was used as a kitchen.
It's excellent.
This is excellent... exactly what I need.
You see, I'm a pathologist,
a sort of medical scientist.
I wanted to find a place where I could
study and do a little experimental work.
I'd take the other rooms as well...
live in them and work up here.
- Would that be all right?
- Of course.
This would be particularly useful...
because, occasionally, I require great heat.
Would there be any objection
to my moving in tonight?
I don't even want to go out again.
I have everything that I need.
We, uh... We haven't discussed terms.
- Anything you suggest.
- Well, I thought, with meals and attention...
- Five pounds a week?
- Five?
You've no idea how much it means
to me to find just the place I need.
It's such a relief.
And besides, you're not quite
the usual landlady, are you?
I think I should tell you why
I want a paying guest here.
My husband was a tea broker
in the City... Mincing Lane.
Not very long ago, he
misinterpreted a commission...
and bought an entire
shipment at the wrong price.
Making good the loss has
left us in rather low water.
So now you must let rooms.
He has income from a
little entailed property...
so we still manage to keep our appearances.
But he'd give anything
to be in business again.
Originally, my husband
started business with Â£100.
Now, if I could get that much together
again and hand it over to him...
I'm sure he'd go into the City
again as he did 20 years ago.
Oh, I understand completely.
We can't go on much longer as we have been.
He'll break up with nothing to do.
In fact, he's had a nervous breakdown.
So if at times he seems a little eccentric...
or irritable or even rude towards you...
I'm sure you'll understand
that, too, and excuse it.
- Why, of course.
- [Chuckles]
In a way, these dreadful Jack
the Ripper murders are a godsend.
He thinks and argues about
them instead of moping.
This is like a refuge.
Since I am going to move in now...
I think I should pay you
a month's rent in advance.
Twenty pounds.
I'm afraid that my habits are irregular.
I often need to be out quite late at night.
But I'll use the back door into the
mews so as not to disturb anyone.
Just regard me as a lodger, not as a guest.
Then you will hardly know
that I'm in the house.
Whatever you wish. The maid will get
your meals whenever you want them.
- You have a maid?
- It happens to be her night out.
But I'll get you some supper.
You would like some supper, I expect.
Yes, I should. Thank you.
This is a beautiful old Bible.
- It was my Aunt Sophie's.
- You'll leave it here?
If you'd like to have it.
Mine, too, are the problems of life...
and death.
[Newsboys Shouting, Indistinct]
[Newsboys Shouting, Indistinct]
[Newsboy] Murder in Whitechapel! Murder!
The Ripper's been at it again!
Ripper sensation! Read it in your paper!
Oh, it's you. I wondered
why the door was open.
- Where have you been? -
Where-Where have I been?
I just slipped out. There's a
new edition come up, you know.
I heard the newsboy shouting.
People are getting really alarmed.
Especially women. He
only does women, you know.
He cuts their throat, and
then he... uses his knife.
- [Tsks]
- It's terrible.
They say the papers daren't
print all the details.
The frightening part about it
is nobody knows why he does it...
or what he's like.
By the way, did you, uh,
get rid of that fella?
He's taken the rooms.
Well, that means there's
a stranger in the house.
We'll have no more privacy.
He'll be no trouble. We shall
hardly know that he's in the house.
Well, if you really want to do it.
I've done it anyway. [Chuckles]
All right, old girl.
Now I must get him some supper.
- What, you mean he's
already moved in? - Mm-hmm.
Well, what about references?
But, Robert, he's a gentleman...
a kind of doctor, a pathologist.
He insisted on paying a month in advance.
Besides, I'm sure the agents would
never send anyone who wasn't quite...
I suppose I better make some
sort of a show of welcoming him.
- Tomorrow will do, darling.
- Good.
Well, if there's anything I can do for him.
I've finished with this paper.
Perhaps he might like to read the news.
I've brought you some supper. May I come in?
There was something peculiar
about those pictures.
I don't suppose you ever noticed it,
but wherever you went in this room...
the eyes of those women
seemed to follow you about.
That can... get on one's nerves.
Oh, I understand what you mean.
I'll have them taken down tomorrow.
And they're pictures of actresses.
I hope you don't really
object to actresses...
because there's one in the house.
- My niece, Kitty.
- And she is on the stage?
She's making a name for herself
in the provincial music halls.
Next week, she opens at the Theatre
Royal, Piccadilly, here, topping the bill.
She's brought over a dance from Paris.
It's very saucy, almost
as daring as the cancan.
Of course, Kitty doesn't intend
to stay in the music halls.
Later on, she hopes to
get into musical comedy.
Then she'll have half the
men in London at her feet.
"Behold, there met him a
woman, subtle of heart. "
Oh, I don't think Kitty's especially subtle.
You'll find her very clever and charming.
Wait till you see her. You'll
change your mind about actresses.

[Door Closes]
## [Whistling]
- [Horse Hooves Clattering] -
The four- wheeler's coming, sir.
- Here's the pass I promised you.
- To tell you the truth, sir...
I don't fancy walking home alone from the
theater late at night... even for Miss Kitty...
not with all the papers saying it's
about time for the Ripper to do another.
He's never killed anybody up this way.
- He can always decide to open up new ground.
- Oh, well.
[Young Woman] Come along, darling.
[Ellen] You're going to have plenty
of time? You've got everything?
- Everything's at the theater.
- I'm sorry. I'm fussing. I shouldn't.
/Da da dee / You look very smart.
You don't look half-bad yourself, my dear.
- Are you ready for it?
- I'd better be. It's my big night.
Mr. Slade, you haven't yet
met my niece, Kitty Langley.
- How do you do?
- The woman "subtle of heart. "
You must admit she really is rather charming.
Oh. Are you coming to the theater too?
I have a pass here if you can use it.
No. I'm afraid I have work that I must do.
Then you won't be in to dinner, sir?
No. I may be out late, quite late.
Until the early hours of the morning.
I warned you of my irregular habits.
You have been out rather late once or twice.
Didn't I hear you two nights ago?
It was past 1:00 in the morning.
- What do you do out so late?
- You hardly ever go out in the day, do you, sir?
I enjoy the streets at
night... when they're empty.
- You mean you just walk about?
- Sometimes.
Sometimes I go down to the Thames.
I... like the river.
- I do, too, on a sunny day.
- I like it in a different way.
Have you ever held your
face close to the water...
and let it wash against your
hands as you look down into it?
Deep water is dark...
and restful...
and... full of peace.
But... I mustn't delay you.
I hope your debut is successful.
Thank you.
Why don't you go out by the front door?
I prefer the back door. I... always use it.
Good night.
- [Door Opens, Closes]
- He's a curious fellow.
- A very curious fellow.
- Kitty. Kitty, we'll be late.
Now that you've no dinner to get to, Daisy,
you've no excuse for missing the performance.
Come to my dressing room afterwards.
I'll send you home in a cab.
- How's that?
- Oh, bless you, miss!
I'll be clapping me hands off for you, miss.
Thank you, Daisy.
- Piccadilly Theatre Royal.
- Right you are, sir.
[Horse Hooves Clattering]
You fascinate him, you know.
He can't take his eyes off you.
I found him interesting in a way.
Well, I could do without him about the house.
Something a bit... odd
about him, don't you think?
Lots of people seem odd to
other people at times, dear.
I thought somehow he seemed a little lost.
I believe that's because
he's lonely, darling.
Here you are, ladies.
Montague Square, ladies.
Step out, please. Mind your step, dear.
It's a little bit wet.
Look after yourself now.
Here you are, sir. Aldgate and Whitechapel.
Thank you, sir. There's
plenty of room inside, sir.

Now, listen a minute, Charlie.

Five and 16. All right, laddie.
Don't I always come back when someone
new is using my old dressing room?
I can't let you in.
We'll come 'round afterwards.
- Good-bye, darling. - Miss
Langley. Good evening, sir.
Word's going around there'll
be royalty in the house.
- We don't know who it is yet.
- Royalty.
- That's wonderful, Kitty.
- I must go and tell the girls.
Bless you.
- Good luck.
- Good luck, darling.
Miss. You know me.
I'm Annie Rowley... "La Belle Anne. "
- Look here, Annie.
- It's all right, Charlie. I know Annie.
You want to see your old
dressing room, don't you? Come on.
- /[Orchestra]
- Here we are, Annie.
- /[Continues, Muted]
- You got a nice lot of flowers...
more than I had when I opened
when the theater was new.
- Did you have this room for long?
- They didn't take to me.
I remember the night I looked
in that mirror before I went on.
I looked at myself, and I
wondered how I'd go over.
I didn't go over.
Having talent isn't enough.
You've got to have luck too.
I broke my luck. I whistled
to myself before I went on.
Something bad always happens if
you whistle in the dressing room.
- Oh, Annie.
- It's an old superstition.
All right, Annie dear. I shan't whistle.
Your luck's all right, and
you've got real looks too.
I saw you at the Grand Theatre,
Woolwich, a couple of months ago.
- They're going to love you here.
- I hope so.
This is me.
- Are you going to be out front tonight, Annie?
- No.
It would break my heart to see
you gettin' what I never got.
Besides, a nephew of mine
was married this morning...
and I said I'd get back to the party.
- Oh, I didn't come for that, miss.
- Take it, please.
A golden sovereign. Oh, miss.
- [All Laughing]
- Have you heard the news?
They're putting flowers in the royal box.

[Applause Continues]
I've just heard, sir, there's
been another Ripper murder.
Kitty, congratulations from
all of us. Here's to you.
- [All Chattering]
- Here's to you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Marjorie, Betty, Jane, all of you.
Coming from you, this...
this means more than all
the applause in the world.
Excuse me, sir. There's a
gentleman to see Miss Kitty.
He says he's from Scotland Yard.
I'm sorry, sir, but it's essential
that I see Miss Langley immediately.
- [All Chattering]
- Kitty.
Very lovely, if I may say so, sir.
You may say so, Bates.
- You're a policeman, Mr. Warwick?
- Inspector Warwick, miss.
I must apologize for this intrusion...
but I came here directly from Whitechapel.
You had a woman here earlier... Annie Rowley.
She told some of her friends how generous
you'd been. That's what led me to you.
Miss Langley, were you
well-acquainted with her?
Not particularly. Everybody
in the theater knows her.
- What is all this?
- I know. Jack the Ripper's got her.
[Tsks] She stood right
where you're standing now.
Why would the Ripper want
to go after anyone like her?
I don't know.
It's funny she should have sent this.
You know, I... I almost
don't like to touch it.
- It came just a little while ago.
- It's ever so pretty.
That must have cost Annie half
a sovereign to have made up.
We formed a cordon. The alarm spread through
the district, but we couldn't trace him.
Are the mutilations repeated?
Oh, this is Dr. Sheridan, the theater doctor.
Oh, yes. Yes, he used his
knife pretty extensively.
They don't call him the Ripper for nothing.
- My belief is that he's a man of considerable medical knowledge.
- Oh, I'm sure of it.
It's proved by the deadly
nature of his assaults.
In the last case, his first stroke cut...
the sternocleidomastoid muscle clean through.
And his second stroke divided
the ensiform cartilage.
Does anybody know why
he commits these murders?
The Ripper must have a motive...
but no man alive can even
guess at what it might be.
And the women who could know are dead.
Have you discovered anything
yourself... any clues to him?
One rather odd thing.
Each of the murdered women was at
one time or another on the stage.
Why doesn't somebody shoot him?
It's against the law for anyone
to use firearms, even the police.
[Bates] And we all get so jumpy down there.
- We'd likely be banging away at one another.
- That'll do, Bates.
- Did anybody see him this time?
- Some of our men thought they saw him.
They couldn't describe
him clearly, but, uh...
they swear that he was
carrying a small black bag.
It says here, "The bag appeared to
be made of shiny black oilcloth...
"and was the sort of bag that doctors always
use to carry their tools or their dinner...
and was of a size convenient to
conceal the Ripper's long knife. "
Well, what's the matter?
Robert.
Silly, isn't it, but I was thinking...
that Mr... Mr. Slade came here
the night of the other murder.
And all he had with him
was a little black bag.
And he took the bag with him
when he went out last night.
- He did not.
- But he did, dear.
His bag was not black, and he
didn't have it with him last night.
- He did.
- Would you stake your oath on that...
your solemn oath in a court of law?
Not only was his bag not black, but you're
not even sure that he had it with him.
He wasn't home but past 3:00 this morning.
I heard him creeping up the stairs.
Naturally he crept up the stairs. What
do you expect him to do, dance and sing?
Do you want him to wake
the whole house, do you?
You don't even read the news...
and you sit there working up the most
illogical and preposterous suspicions.
- [Commotion Outdoors]
- Robert.
[Robert] Police.
All right, Daisy. I'll go.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir. Good morning, madam.
I'm sorry to trouble you so early,
but, uh, it's rather important.
Well, come in, but don't leave your
bobbies standing on my doorstep.
- All right. Keep moving, Bates.
- Very good, sir.
Well, what are you doing here, Mr. Warwick?
I've been reading all about myself
and the gentleman with the black bag.
Did you know that poor woman sent me
some flowers to the theater last night?
Sort of a good-luck horseshoe.
That was my excuse for calling.
- Good morning, darlings. [Making Kisses]
- Morning, my dear.
I didn't see that till after you'd left.
The stage doorkeeper told the local
constable about it, and he reported it to us.
I want to find out what florist it came from.
We brought the horseshoe home
if you'd like to look at it.
Thank you for a lovely breakfast, Daisy.
Would you like to see those, darling?
We're trying to trace her
movements after she left you.
- Here it is. It's roses and London pride.
- Hmm.
Here's the box it came in,
sir. The name's on the lid.
I must have this address.
Mr. Slade, he's going out
very early this morning.
[Daisy, Quietly] He's not
going out. He's coming in here.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Mr. Slade, I haven't even
started to get your breakfast.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I just came down to get the paper.
- Oh, uh, Mr. Warwick, this is Mr. Slade.
- How do you do?
Mr. Warwick's from Scotland Yard.
He's engaged on the Ripper case.
My men are hanging around trying
to get a look at Miss Langley.
Your opening performance went well?
- Tremendously well.
- We had royalty there.
- Must have been very gratifying.
- When are you coming to see the show?
Mr. Slade doesn't care for the theater, dear.
But why not? I must insist on
you coming some evening very soon.
Haven't you enough men at your feet already?
I didn't intend to intrude.
If I could have a paper.
Oh, uh, they've seen the Ripper again.
- I don't think you'll ever catch him.
- Why not?
Whitechapel was swarming with police, and yet
you haven't come near laying a hand on him.
You don't know any more about him
now than you did in the beginning.
- We have our theories though.
- Theories?
The favorite one is that he's
a maniac and kills at random.
- Do you think that?
- No, I don't.
Well, he's a bit of a back-alley
specialist, if you ask me.
He never goes after women unless
they're alone and undefended.
Some of us are inclined
to believe that, uh...
he has a grudge against a particular woman.
When he finds her, then
the murders will cease.
- [Ellen] Do you
believe that? - Mm-mmm.
What is your theory about him then?
Well, if you'd care to come
to Scotland Yard sometime...
I'd be very happy to explain it to you.
If my ideas are right, I'll makeJack the Ripper's
own fingers tie the noose that'll hang him.
I don't know what you mean by
that, but there's a new clue here.
"Ripper. Man with bag wanted. "
[Warwick] Yes, they're
very excited about that.
If you'll excuse me, I
have some things to do.
One afternoon next week, I'll
show you our Black Museum.
- I shall be most
interested. - Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Mr.
Warwick. - Good-bye.
Oh, Daisy, if that's Mr. Slade's
breakfast, I'll take it up.
Mr. Slade! What's burning up there?
Don't come up here.
I'm sorry if there's an odor, but
there was something I had to do.
I'll open the window. Just
leave the tray, if you please.
[Loud Slam]
- Robert.
- Uncle.
- We've looked all over the house for you.
- Where have you been?
Uh, I-I went out. I've just come in.
[Quietly] We've something to tell you.
Mr. Slade has burned his bag.
I smelled burning. I didn't
say anything to you at the time.
When I heard him go to his
room, I went up to the attic.
And this is what I found.
It was in the refuse pail.
He was out half last night.
Then he saw this morning's
headlines and burned his bag.
- Very sensible of him.
- Why do you say that?
Nobody can afford to own a bag like that now.
Look here. A man was mobbed in
Trafalgar Square this morning.
They nearly had his lifejust because
he was carrying a small black bag.
That sort of thing's
going on all over London.
I came straight home when I read
about it, because I remembered...
I had a small black bag of that sort.
So I hid it.
- Anyone who even owns one is under suspicion.
- Shh.
That's why he tried to get rid
of his just as I've hidden mine.
- It's the only sensible thing to do.
- Frightening myself like this.
You're all worked up. I'll get
you a glass of sherry, old girl.
Your uncle's right, of course.
We really know very little about Mr. Slade.
He's coming down.
- Good afternoon.
- You're going out early, Mr. Slade.
Yes. I've just completed an
experiment. I must test it.
- Where do you do that?
- It would be where you work, I suppose.
Yes. At the University Hospital.
You will excuse me, won't you?
[Door Opens, Closes]
- The University Hospital.
- That's in Gower Street.
I wonder if he really works there.
It's near my hairdresser's,
and I'm going there now.
[No Audible Dialogue]
- Charlie.
- Good afternoon, sir.
Excuse me. Who was it that just went in?
- One of the doctors, miss.
- I thought I recognized him.
He works down in the path lab.
Very pleasant gent indeed, ma'am.
- Has he worked here long?
- Oh, quite some time now.
He, uh, works here off and on,
if you know what I mean, miss.
He ain't what I'd call one of our regulars.
Oh, there you are, sir. The
lady was just askin' about you.
- I thought I saw you go in a moment ago.
- Why, Miss Langley.
- I had an appointment next door.
- You followed me.
- Do you expect to be followed?
- No, but...
But I know that I arouse curiosity.
I've become so absorbed in my work that I...
sometimes forget what people may think.
I've been asked to move several
times because I was no longer welcome.
I so hoped to remain on at
your house in Montague Square...
until my work was finished.
But there's no thought of your leaving.
- I rather feel your Aunt Ellen...
- She had too much excitement last night.
These dreadful Ripper murders
are playing on her imagination.
I'm sure you'll find her
quite normal by tea time.
Then you don't feel that she
wants me to go somewhere else?
But of course not. We'd miss you.
See you at home.
[Knocking]
[Louder Knocking]
Mr. Slade.
Your tea.
Kitty's making a real success.
She's been asked to open the new Palace
of Varieties in Whitechapel High Street.
They are going to have a music hall there?
They were going to postpone the opening.
Then they decided that would look as
though they were afraid ofJack the Ripper.
[Chuckles]
Mr. Slade, I... I think
Kitty would like it...
if you overcame your
prejudices and saw the show.
She dances wonderfully, and Kitty
really does look very beautiful.
Solomon says, "A strange woman
lieth in wait, as for prey.
She increases transgressors among men. "
Women of the theater... actresses...
they're powdered and
painted to look beautiful.
I can show you something more
beautiful than a beautiful woman.
- Something much more beautiful.
- [Key Turning In Lock]
I had a brother, and he was a genius.
And I loved him very dearly.
Here's a portrait he painted of himself.
Isn't that a wonderful face?
Look at that remarkable brow... lofty.
See the life in those eyes.
They're fine and clear.
There's a sensitivity about his lips.
You're looking at the work of a genius.
It's as real as though he were alive.
I can almost hear his voice
again when I look at this.
Isn't that a marvelous piece of
work to come from the hands of a man?
- Ayoung man.
- Oh, it is marvelous.
But how peculiar to paint so small.
He must have had wonderful eyes.
He had strange eyes.
He was a strange man.
And he died?
I'm sorry.
He need not have died.
He need not have died.
Those are the death masks
of various murderers...
some of whom were publicly
hanged outside NewgateJail.
some of whom were publicly
hanged outside NewgateJail.
You can see the rope marks on their necks.
And, uh, over there are the
ropes that were actually used...
to hang some of these men.
Everything here at our Black Museum...
has figured at some time or
other in a celebrated crime.
- What's this shovel?
- Oh, that was used to, uh...
bury a couple of corpses in a little
chicken run in the Hackney Marshes Murder.
How awful.
- Um, Miss Langley.
- Yes, Inspector?
I have a question to ask you.
- Only one, Inspector?
- Just one for now.
- I have dozens to ask you.
- Really?
For instance...
what's this chopper for?
That was used by the Clark twins to kill
Herbert Thompson in the Tufnell Park Murder.
Uh, Miss Langley, would you come
on Friday for tea at my mother's?
I'd like her to meet you.
What's that cup?
That belonged to Mrs. Gately. She
disposed of four heavily insured husbands.
- With a cup?
- She put poison in their tea.
- Will you come?
- And what's this, Inspector?
Oh, some poor chap beat his
sweetheart to death with this.
- Why did he do it?
- Well, we've never known exactly...
but my belief at this moment is that she
failed to answer some perfectly simple question.
In that case, Inspector,
I'll come to tea on Friday.
Thank you, Miss Langley.
And, uh, here are the fingerprint charts.
Ah. I wanted to present my compliments
to our distinguished visitor.
- Miss Langley.
- How do you do?
This is Sir Edward Willoughby,
the Commissioner of Police.
I've just been to the palace
about the Ripper murders.
I don't think I want to go through
an interview like that again.
Her Majesty knows that the
papers say another may be due.
Have you estimated when it might occur?
He says he can predict
the time of each murder.
There's a strange periodicity
to the Ripper's crimes.
Four murders, each within 10 to 12 days.
Well, we know they happen regularly.
It's as though the desire of the
Ripper to kill surges to a peak...
he's satisfied, and then he's
quiet until the impulse returns.
When do you think he'll do another?
The night after tomorrow.

Very good, Jennie. Here,
have one on the house.
- Thanks, I will.
- There you are, me girl.
Did you see Kitty Langley
often to imitate her that way?
- Only once.
- Good, ain't she?
- Hello, Jennie.
- Hello, Wiggy.
You wouldn't like to lend
me that concertina, would ya?
Why? What do you want it for?
- Play hymns down the Whitechapel High Street.
- Oh.
- Good health,
mate. - Cheer-o.
Have you given up pickin' pockets, Wiggy?
Had to. The Ripper's brought too
many of you coppers down here.
I can make enough for a
whole week playing hymns.
And I'll bring it back in
the morning. That's a promise.
Well, if you want it that bad, here you are.
Ah! Lord love ya, Jennie.
- ## [Hymn]
- Here, outside if you're gonna play that thing.
- Out you get.
- Here, I ought to be movin' too.

- Have you seen Jennie lately?
- Oh, she's a good sort.
She lent me this. She just went in.
Aye. There's a smoking concert at the
Red Lion next Tuesday night, you know.
Maybe she could sing a few songs for them.
- She needs work ever so badly.
- Aye.
I'll go right now and see her
about it. Giddyap. Come on here.

Oh, my!
There's been a murder! Police! Police!
For the love of Mike! Police!
[Blowing Whistle]
[Blowing Whistle]
It was the Ripper all right.
- Did you see anyone come out after she came in?
- Nobody came out, sir.
Then he must still be about.
- Form a cordon around here.
- Stand men shoulder to shoulder.
- Don't let anyone pass.
- Search these buildings.
- [People Chattering]
- [Policemen Shouting, Indistinct]
[Man] He must be around here someplace!

[No Audible Dialogue]
They don't seem to find 'im.
I don't see how he could've got away.
[Police Whistle Blows]
That's the other side of Whitechapel.
[Whistle Blowing]
The Ripper's got away.
[Sniffs]
[Sniffing]
[Door Opens]
- Mr. Slade, what are you doing?
- Burning my ulster.
Please, don't come too near.
Are those stains on it?
It... became contaminated...
in a pathological laboratory.
I have to be drastic, or the
contamination would spread.
You mean, it may carry a disease?
The stove in my room wasn't big enough.
That's why I made the fire in here.
I have to destroy this completely.
I smelled burning, and I came...
Oh. I should have closed the kitchen door.
Then perhaps the odor wouldn't
have spread through the house.
[Metal Lid Clatters]
- That'll wake everyone in the house.
- I'm sorry.
Well, it's done.
There's no danger now?
- No.
- You thought about the risk to us.
- But what about yourself?
- I'll be all right.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
I'll open the window and
let some of the smoke out.
It's almost daylight, and here's the milkman.
Hello, mate. Heard about the Ripper?
Yes. He was up to his old
tricks again last night.
[Milkman] They told me they
practically copped him, but he got away.
What's the news, son?
Boy. Throw the paper down here.
Thank you.
- We should go to the police.
- What, and scandalize the whole neighborhood?
We've very little to go on
when you consider it calmly.
- Robert, Kitty saw the stains.
- But I told you what they were.
You get ideas out of reading the papers.
Remember how excited and
upset you were over that bag?
Well, you were wrong, weren't you?
Has it occurred to you that he
might have been telling the truth?
He's a medical man, and he'd know the
danger if his coat was contaminated.
He was protecting us.
I believe you ought to be thanking
him instead of suspecting him.
- Well, perhaps you're right.
- Of course I am.
Now I'm going to run along
and get a little more sleep.
Well, I've always said he's
a very eccentric fellow.
Robert, I think we must make certain...
that Kitty's never left
alone in the house with him.
Just for safety's sake.
[Ellen] You'll look
exquisite wearing that, dear.
Oh, these flowers came from the
florist's a little while ago.
- [Kitty] Our carriage will have an escort of mounted police.
- Is John arranging that?
By a very funny coincidence, a squad
will be going to Whitechapel for duty...
and we're going that way too.
Oh, I don't think I like this. Where's Daisy?
She went out after giving Mr. Slade his tea.
- I put a note on his tray.
- What?
It was just a reminder about the
opening at the new Palace tonight.
- Oh, no. This will never do.
- It looks a bit overdone.
What'll I do? I have to have
some flowers for the opening.
I know. A posy. How long will Daisy be?
She'll be rather late,
I'm afraid. I'll take it.
- Would you, darling?
- Of course.
[Door Opens, Closes]
- [Door Closes]
- This hat has given you very good service, sir.
- [Door Closes]
- This hat has given you very good service, sir.
- Yes. There's a bit of a dent here.
- Oh.
- [Blows] I can get that out, sir.
- Thank you.
You're going to the opening of
Miss Kitty tonight, I take it, sir.
I wouldn't fancy going down
to Whitechapel myself, sir.
That's safe enough. You'll let
me have it around about an hour?
- I'll get it up very special, sir.
- Thank you.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day to you, sir.
[Chattering]
Robert. I didn't know you had come out.
I just stepped 'round
to Harris's with my hat.
- Where's Daisy?
- She's shopping.
- Then Kitty's in the house alone.
- She wanted this bouquet altered.
- I thought you were in the bedroom.
- I'm getting back.
You didn't mind my sending
up the little note, did you?
I was glad to have it.
I came down to thank you.
Are you able to go to the theater?
I'm not sure yet.
I guarantee you the rest
of the show will be good.
I have some passes. I'll get you one.
Won't you sit down?
I expect that many men have told
you that you're very beautiful.
Oh. Well, I don't always believe them.
My brother could have captured
your beauty... for all time.
Your brother, he was an artist, wasn't he?
He was a genius.
It was the beauty of women
that led him to his destruction.
Yours is a beauty which could destroy men.
Oh, is that a compliment?
Or it could destroy you.
Have you ever thought of that?
That's a very queer thing to say. Besides
that, I don't think I'm beautiful at all.
I, uh, take great trouble
to give that impression.
It is one thing if a woman is
beautiful merely for herself.
But when she exhibits the loveliness
of her body upon the stage...
as a lure, leading men on...
Oh, you are prejudiced
against actresses, aren't you?
You wouldn't think that
anyone could hate a thing...
and love it too.
You can't love and hate at the same time.
You can, and it's a problem then.
I take my problems to the river...
because water is soothing
when it runs dark and deep.
And a man can think.
The water answers problems, you know?
You sound lonely.
And the answer is...
that a man can destroy what he hates...
and love what he destroys.
I also know that there is evil in beauty.
- But if the evil is cut out...
- [Door Opens]
Hello, Uncle.
[Sighs]
We've been having a most
interesting conversation.
Mr. Slade is quite a philosopher.
- I do hope you'll be able to come this evening.
- Thank you.
I'll look forward to
seeing you in Whitechapel.
You can dismount your men.
Come in, my boy. We've been watching for you.
Is that you, John? I shan't be long.
- Plenty of time.
- Did you remember to bring my escort?
Yes, the square's full of mounted police.
And in another moment, he
might have had his hands on her.
Did Kitty realize what was happening?
She didn't seem to, and we
haven't told her anything.
With a performance tonight, we didn't even
want her to think there was anything wrong.
It's an accumulation of little
things, one on top of the other.
Destroying his bag, burning his
ulster, staying up all night.
I think this thing can be settled right away.
Here's a fingerprint the
Ripper left in Whitechapel...
then again in Mitre Square.
If it were possible for me to see something
Mr. Slade had held in his right hand...
a glass or something of that sort...
Has Daisy taken his toddy up yet?
He always has a hot drink about now.
- Lemon and spices, a sort of appetizer.
- She's preparing it now.
If you took it up and waited
to bring the glass down...
Yes.
[Knocking]
Yes?
We have a little excitement outside.
They're waiting for Kitty. She'll
be leaving in a few minutes.
I'm going out too. I shan't
be in for dinner tonight.
Oh, do you like my new ulster?
Oh, yes. If you don't mind,
I'll wait to take down the glass.
If I seem a little excited tonight...
you'll understand why.
If you've ever worked... for a long time...
long and dangerously...
you'll know how it feels when you believe...
that in a little while...
in a little while, you'll
finish what you have to do.
You're referring to your work?
- Yes.
- You mean you're going away?
Perhaps. I don't know.
I rather think I may.
You'll let me know if you, uh...
Oh, yes. Of course I'll let you know...
if I can.
- He used his right hand?
- Yes.
- You sure you didn't touch it?
- I didn't.
That's fine.
It's nice and clear.
- Are you sure he used his right hand?
- Quite sure.
Turn it over, will you?
Well, you needn't worry
about Mr. Slade anymore.
- These prints don't match.
- Then it wasn't him.
- Can't be.
- John, why must it be his right hand?
Obviously this print couldn't possibly
have been made by the Ripper's left hand.
- It couldn't, eh?
- Not unless every detective at the Yard is wrong.
I wonder if we could be.
- Daisy, where's everybody?
- That's Kitty.
I've got to think this out. Could you
go ahead with Kitty, and we'll follow?
If you don't mind staying
behind for a few minutes.
I'm ready, everybody. John.
My men outside are going to think
that you were well worth waiting for.
Thank you.
Mr. Slade doesn't want dinner, so you take a
bus to the theater and come home in the carriage.
- Honest, ma'am? I can get a bus on the corner.
- Good.
All ready now. We'll follow in a few minutes.
Oh, aren't you coming with us?
- John and I have something we want to talk about.
- I'm awfully sorry.
We'll follow almost immediately.
They're waiting for you.
The Ripper used his knife from
right to left, across the throat...
like a left-handed man.
We never let it come out that
the Ripper was left-handed.
If he were left-handed... Stand up a minute.
Then he would take his
victim like this, you see...
and the cut of his knife would
start on this side, from here.
Now, turn around.
If the Ripper faced his victims
instead of taking them from behind...
then he'd have to use his right
hand to make that kind of cut...
and it would be his left hand
that made the prints I found.
- Shh.
- [Footsteps]
You going out, sir?
You might just as well have used the
front door instead of coming this way.
- I'll light you out.
- Are you going to the theater, Daisy?
Yes, sir. I'm just off to catch a bus.
Daisy.
I want you to have this.
- You've been very good, looking after me.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Thanks ever so.
[Gasping] It's you, sir.
- Was that Mr. Slade?
- Yes, sir. He just went out the back way.
- All right. You go along. I'll lock up.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye,
sir. - Good-bye.
[Bell Rings]
- Hey! Hey!
- [Bell Rings]
- Whitechapel High
Street? - Right-o, miss.
All the way to Whitechapel. Hop in.
[Bell Ringing]
What's that?
- [Robert] Found something?
- I can't be sure.
This powder's so coarse, I can't see
the ridges and characteristics clearly.
Somehow I'll get clear
prints of his left hand.
I wonder if there's anything else
here. Let's take a look at that.
- Locked, I suppose.
- Yes.
That's the picture Ellen spoke to
me about. His brother painted it.
I've seen a miniature like this before.
I think we have something here. Come on.
- Do you mind going on to Whitechapel alone?
- Why?
I want to look in at the Yard.
I'll follow as soon as possible.
When you get to the
theater, stay close to Kitty.
/[Orchestra]
I found this picture in
Slade's room, Superintendent.
It's of his brother. You
remember the first Ripper murder?
- Lizzie Turner, last August.
- She had a sweetheart.
The one who died of drink or something?
After the murder, I found this picture
in her room. Slade's brother again.
I picked it up at the
Black Museum on my way here.
That's as he used to be, and this one is
the same man, also painted by himself...
only he degenerated, dragged
down by Lizzie and her kind.
Slade killed Lizzie because
she ruined his brother.
But this doesn't prove that
Slade is Jack the Ripper.
But it's sufficient grounds
for action. Slade is deranged.
He believes he's doing right to rid
the world of the kind of woman...
that brought his brother to this...
and I'm pretty sure he's
in the theater somewhere.
## [Upbeat]
If you spot anyone like him, Inspector
Warwick will come and identify him.
I'm sure he's in the theater somewhere.
Be quick and quiet and report
back here. Move along now.
/[Orchestra]
Are you tired of life?
Are you bored with your wife?
Is a laugh really out of the question? Oui?
Then I take you with me, and we go to Paris.
Hmm? /[Singing]
Hmm!
## [Singing]
May I?
[Applauding]
- No sign of him, sir.
- Nobody answering that description, sir.
- We drew a blank, sir.
- It was a false alarm. Anybody else report?
- No.
- Then I better get backstage. Her number's just ended.
[Applauding]
One more, Miss Langley.
- Wonderful show, Miss Langley. Wonderful.
- Thank you.
- You really were wonderful.
- Oh, there's John.
- Ah, hello, John.
- I'm sorry I'm so late.
Never mind. I want to change
and see the rest of the program.
Will you wait for me?
## [Singing]
## [Whistling]
/[Singing]
/[Ends]
## [Humming]
[Slade] I said I'd be here.
/[Singing Continues, Indistinct]
I promised I would be here if I could.
- But the others are taking me home.
- I'm not going home.
I'm going away, and I'm
going to take you with me.
But... But I want to see
the rest of the show, and...
and I'll have to change.
So if you'll wait outside...
I shan't be very long.
You're so exquisite.
You're always so complimentary.
More wonderful than anything I've ever known.
Why don't you sit here?
We can talk while I change behind the screen.
I can't lose you now.
It is such lovely women
as you who drag men down.
We're missing the show, aren't we?
After all, I... I don't
really have to change.
Let's watch it together. I'll be beside you.
- Shall we go?
- You know they're waiting out there to kill me.
You corrupt and destroy men...
as my brother was destroyed.
But when the evil is cut
out of a beautiful thing...
then only the beauty remains.
We've... talked of this before, haven't we?
Those others whom you...
were they beautiful?
I watched you tonight...
out there.
You were even more lovely
than when I first saw you.
When you thought I was the
woman "subtle of heart"?
Solomon warned me against such a woman.
- But that is the evil in you!
- [Gasps]
[Whimpers]
The evil which must be cut out?
But...
But isn't it the life in a
thing which makes it beautiful?
If you take the life away, then...
Then it becomes still.
Then it is even more beautiful.
I'll be still for you.
I'll stand here quite still and let
you look at me, if that's what you want.
I want to make sure that
you belong only to me.
I love you...
and I hate the evil in you.
Love is very close to hate.
Did you know that? Don't be afraid!
You have no reason to be afraid of me.
I have never known such beauty as yours...
- [Gasping]
- nor such evil in such beauty.
Men will not look at you
again as they did tonight!
John! John! John! Mr. Slade is here!
[Kitty Screaming]
John! John! John! John!
John!

- The police are looking for the Ripper!

[Screaming, Agitated Shouting]
Come, Kitty. We'll soon get you home.
They say the Ripper's loose in
the audience. The crowd's half-mad.
Hurry. Let's try this way.
- You mustn't go out into the street.
- What shall we do?
Better keep her here. Be
easier to keep an eye on her.
- He slipped us, sir.
- He could still be in the building.
Bates, get some men, search those
galleries. John, take charge of the stage.
Right.
[Screams]
[Man] Finish him off, sir.
Take him alive.
- I know how to tackle him.
- Watch out for his knife.
He'll cut you to pieces.
[Panting]
He must have been carried down this way.
He said deep water was restful...
and full of peace.
The river drew him even in the end.
A river sweeps a city clean.
Carries things out to sea...
and they sink in deep water.
If it was him...
I'm glad.
