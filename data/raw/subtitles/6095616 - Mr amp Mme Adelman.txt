Mother, are you ready?
I'm going to.
In these troubled times
for the intolerance and the barbarism,
I'm thrilled to speak at this time
before you.
There are so many memories,
so many fake laughter,
so much shared...
We cried for a poet.
In fact, is a writer of immeasurable value
that just left us.
There are so many masterpieces to mention,
The Village Uncomfortable,
The Headquarters Of The Wolf,
and still The Mills Of Silence,
his last book and perhaps his masterpiece.
Victor was one of the men most funny
and the most courageous, also,
I've had the luck of living
and in addition to an immense
Victor leaves his wife, Sarah.
His accomplice ever since.
Enough already, isn't it? Me!
No, No. Let's stop this.
No!
- To. - Let I!
MONSIEUR & MADAME ADELMAN
Careful, don't run!
Very pale, was what I heard.
Say what you want,
but it seems to me strange that story.
To fall of the cliff at Étretat you have to want to.
- As he put it? - I don't know.
Hello, Sra. Adelman?
- Am I bothering you? - Who are you?
I Am Antoine Grillot.
I am also preparing a biography about her husband.
- The lady called me in the morning. - Oh, yes. Sorry.
I was waiting for you. Thank you for coming.
But I don't want to bother them.
Ah, yes, yes. Me bother you.
Only have old people and children here. I got tired of both.
Sit down, my boy.
Thank you.
My God, it is the office of her husband?
Intimidating enough.
I think that I know the history of this mobile.
Is not the desk of Lamartine
that gave him the gift for the 70 years?
Exactly.
I can see that if informed well.
It cost me out the wazoo
and he never used to write.
So, what do you want to know?
I swear that this can wait.
Your book will treat of what?
Biographies of her husband, already there are many.
- too much! - I Agree.
But this time I wanted to address
the influence of next to it.
What interests me, in fact... is the lady.
We know very little else about the lady.
This will annoy the whole world.
How? - If a writer
does no one dream, to imagine his wife.
- See this us all out there? - Yes.
They are all wondering if I have not killed Victor.
Not. The lady think?
In any case, I never imagined that the lady could...
But you're wrong.
"Is that the old woman killed the old man?"
This sim is a subject for books for someone your age.
- You want to sell books?
- of Course, yes.
So let's go there. Fast!
- do you mind if I smoke? - no, No.
Victor and I...
It's a long story.
CHAPTER 1 THE STRATEGY OF THE CHANCE
I could tell you
we met in a bookstore,
or in the output of a concert of Pierre Boulez.
Would be so much more elegant.
However, it is not true.
it Was without a doubt the nightclub more overthrow of Paris.
I was on the point of go to find me with the bed,
when, suddenly, the vi.
it Was like an apparition.
That boy was a beauty.
He possessed a charisma nato,
a look so deep...
I was like a mosquito attracted by a lamp,
the point of burning.
That idiot, asshole.
Your kid.
Bastard.
Forgiveness. I'm sorry.
I feel like... I feel like vomiting.
we Talked for hours, he told me of his life.
- How do you call it? - Sarah.
dude, we already feel close to one another.
I was able to.
You know what, Sarah?
The editors are a few scumbags.
Are the sheep. Not have the least imagination.
It has been two years that work for nothing.
Seeing this book here?
I wrote it with my blood.
They prefer the sequins in place of my blood.
Would have done better writing it with my shit.
He was very witty.
No, I think not.
You never said that you are just like the Brigite Bardot
Not.
- I Never said? - Not.
You never told me.
- what? - That I look like the Brigite Bardot.
But it's not! Why would they say that?
You seem to be with you.
You are beautiful being you.
- okay? - Yes?
- what's your name? - Sarah.
Sarah, you want to make love with me?
Well... Yes.
Drug! Shit...
The problem is that the war of Algeria
made a mess of the damned.
It is as if there were two worlds, now.
They are not very far away,
it is as if there is a border here.
It is as if you had the arabs in the left cheek,
and...
As you are beautiful!!!
You're beautiful, you know?
I love you.
How is your name?
- Sarah. - I'll make love to you, Sarah.
I'm going to make love as if it were
the first time in my life.
I...
I...
Shit!
I didn't want to offer me on the first night.
you need to learn to resist the bestiality of men.
For those that think that "Love at first sight"
is a metaphor, never agreed to the side of the Victor.
He still slept and I...
Already knew that would be the around him
that my whole life structure able.
This boy is simple. It was what I needed.
Shit, it was the noise of the pages that you woke up.
Ah, drug.
Be that as it may, I finished.
Last night we...?
No, nothing. Sossegue, you tanked like poop.
He was completely drunk.
So I took the opportunity to read your manuscript.
- what? - I Have several things to say.
Strong. The beginning of the book is very good.
Very classic, but very good.
I think a sentence to describe both
the main characters right at the beginning.
Saw? Even so, it is passable.
On the other hand, the structure of the preliminary...
It is very interesting what you are saying,
but I'm with a huge headache,
I'm not used to drinking and...
I say because last night you were angry
with the publishers, the literary criticism...
But, honestly, that's the way this novel is impublicável.
- Oh, is it? - I Love their dialogues.
You're very good with dialogues.
Have enough blah-blah-blah!
It is almost between romance and drama.
There is a lot of conversation.
Feel the influences. Have you read "The Nausea" and loved it.
You have read Camus.
Maybe even reread.
Sorry, what you do in life?
Do a phd in classical arts in Paris IV.
My field of study are not novels, and yes poetry.
But I allowed myself to make some notes.
- Such as
- You scribbled my text?
I was afraid of forgetting.
- Scribbled all over my text?
- Of Course.
Look at page 17. Is full of redundancies.
And such a lot of adverbs...
Will do me the favor of taking all.
Yes, I agree, I will do this, but...
but now I have to fact that exit.
But wait, I am not finished yet.
No, maybe we can get back to this later.
- When, I don't know. - When exactly?
It is, because I have a lot to say.
I analyzed the novel and also I looked at you.
Me examined? What does this mean?
You have an admirable form of sleep.
That is very kind of her.
- But this will do me live.
- And you kiss very well.
I need to actually take a shower. There I take.
Right. But we need to review.
I wrote down everything here. Look.
This is the phone of my parents. This is where I'm more.
This is the restaurant where I work from 2nd to 5th.
And this is my friend Julie, where I sleep at the end of the week.
Good, so I think that has everything there.
- And what is your phone? - my?
I don't know if it was the alcohol or the night that the enfeou,
but when I woke up was not the same.
Had some two meters away.
And the grandonas do not support imperfections.
It is, I understand. Also I don't like them.
Oh, no. I love the grandonas, but should be sublime.
A defect that is already bothersome.
Because they assume
a claim of mediocrity of them.
The big teeth, for example, a small woman is good.
Looks like a small animal, a squirrel.
- But on a large woman...
- Looks like a donkey.
- Looks like a donkey. - IS.
I was convinced that he
I used to speak so obsessive.
Can't hang out with this type of woman.
She is intelligent, alive, read everything,
dominates the classical arts...
I think she's studying up to the writers asian
chinese, Korean...
And so what? Last year, you were unhappy
because his girlfriend knew nothing of literature.
- Yes, but has half a term. - What is this middle ground?
I don't know, before I drank my coffee, she has cited Kafka,
Huysmans, Dostoyevsky...
She speaks to me of notions that I even know.
And so what? There is a right time
to talk about interesting things?
Of course. Especially after a drinking spree.
If you can talk about everything in the morning, but Dostoevsky,
admit it, it is a heavy dish.
It is... let's Face it, Dostoevsky is too much.
Dane-if Dostoevsky. Dane-all over the world.
You said yourself, this time
I need to focus on the esteem of myself.
I need to love myself a little bit.
For the night, yes, night, not,
dream with me hanging, like a shit, me hanging.
It is not time to be intimidated
by a bitch of the Sorbonne
that will give me lessons while fucked.
In fact, I couldn't even have sex.
He was drunk, too, was a shame.
Even sober, I'm not sure
be able to have an erection a little more solid
in front of a chick that betray me with the 1st chapter
when adjectives and participles are present too.
often say that love triumphs
about the pride and the complex.
Talks a lot of nonsense.
I Called him a hundred times.
the Hours by turning that crap dialer.
... "it is undeniable, he ignited the bodies of the women
as a fireman pyromaniac."
it Is undeniable, he has not found his style.
"Satiated with sighs female,
Fabrice was stunned
by the territories decaying of your soul."
He wrote true shit.
You think she's beautiful?
- Not!
- Maybe that is the problem.
No, no. It is not fantastic, but not horrible.
In addition, she has charm.
With a little dedication, mascara, a good dentist...
So what is the problem?
The problem is that she will castrate.
Already I see it coming.
I see it coming, doctor, with a large pair of scissors.
I see the blood dripping down, I see everything.
And the lord knows very well what's left of my little sex.
I had a lot. It is modest what's left.
With my mother I castrando, my father gave me castrando,
my brother, who I does until I die...
It is not encouraging.
This kind of thing, strip me of the will.
I use diapers.
To be a baby.
With a chick as well small,
baby. A chick of the virgin.
You talk a lot the size of...
- Oh, is it? - Yes.
Of their parts, their bag...
And its... small...
Dick.
Need to broaden the horizons, no?
Even the most proud can wallow
on the ridiculous when the tone continues bestamente
echoing in the emptiness.
Listen,
miss, to stop calling because I'm almost with fear.
Hello?
in fact, after this period, never more care to someone else.
I'm waiting for me to connect.
I tranquilizei saying
that we were very young to begin a story.
We have lost sight of for a time.
And then, by chance, we met one night.
21 APRIL 1972
Put the butts in the ashtray!
Friends, may smoke, but be careful with the carpet. It is brand new.
Drug!
Victor, you come to open?
- Victor, are you going to open? - Yes, I will.
We are in my house, but the birthday is.
- ' Come, give it here. - what are we to drink?
A bloody mary, for you.
- Happy birthday. - Gorgeous here, it is your?
- Is the home of my brother. - Oh, is it?
It is like a cage.
- it does Not even place to sit. - But for he is good,
- is the poet of the family. - I Present to my brother.
Good night. Eldest son of the Right, pleasure.
- Stop it. - Nobody is perfect.
- Me kiss. - What?
I kiss, I have already said!
And thread the bottom of the tongue.
Hi, you. Had not you seen.
- I Need to talk with you. - okay.
- Hi. - Oi, everything okay with you?
Still don't know Sarah.
- I Know. - Not.
- Not. - Girlfriend of Philippe.
I'm seeing. Take.
- To you. Happy birthday. - Thank You.
- we do Not know? - Not.
Not.
As was said by Romain Gary:
"I Know that there is mutual love,
but I do not intend to give me the luxury."
Congratulations to you
on This date dear
best wishes
Many years of life
Thank you very much.
I am sorry. Not I did want to.
Will, blow.
DECEMBER, 1972
At first sight, nothing in Victor indicated
that he had been educated in an environment so bourgeois.
The house of his fathers emanated from a delícioso odor fighter
and conquest industrial.
The walls were heavy with paintings,
furniture and figurines
and his mother, of white wine.
This is not for you.
We're here to win the elections.
We are here to govern.
Missing balls on the left side.
If you want more, have more of a box in the basement.
CHAPTER 2 CHRISTMAS GIFTS
Let me, mommy. Is already tired.
No, I can't do alone.
What time she started drinking?
32 years ago.
Must be your brother getting
with the new girlfriend.
Is not a girlfriend. I call this slut.
- Oh, Claude! - You know?
- It exchanges all the time. - Victor also.
But at least, not the brings home.
And of him we are sure that you do not seek the money.
This with certainty. It is only you enjoying.
I don't believe in destiny.
However, it seems that fate believed in us.
Mao, Stalin, Mitterrand... It's all the same thing.
There is no comparison, they are not the same.
Are yes.
A turd is always a turd.
If you are having fun regardless of the gulag to France,
to continue, but it will be without me.
Have not worked all their lives, to give
my money to the stalinists.
I fully agree.
Dear, stop kissing this dog.
He will get drunk.
It is he who is kissing me.
You give the language for it. It is disgusting.
- And Baudelaire what do you think? - Baudelaire am I?
- Yes. - Think of what?
The union of the Left. What do you think of it?
Baudelaire is not disturbed.
Of course, he does not pay taxes.
Antoine, be kind to your brother.
Need to take the right to vote
of those who do nothing for our economy.
I love you, Victor, but on the day that work...
Why do you say that he does not work?
We speak of a work of truth.
Stop bothering you.
There is only it here that doesn't work with business.
Sophie also does not work.
- Sophie is different. - Why?
To start with, she is a woman.
And so what?
- She is a feminist? - I don't know.
"She"? She has a name.
- Despite being a woman. - Felt offended.
Oh, no. Stay quiet, it is necessary to much more than that.
Congratulations, lady, for peru, is delicious.
Tell that to Philomène, she is in the kitchen.
Ah, you leave it in the kitchen on Christmas night?
But why? It is a problem for you?
- Father, please. - his parents welcomed me
as if I were their daughter.
These cocôs will end up dictating the law in my house.
Claude!
I do not know where I live. I don't know.
Please, please forgive me. It was only a question.
Forgive you gladly. And in addition is a beautiful woman,
so that when he says a huge nonsense,
this becomes almost seductive.
It's funny what it says because it is what I think of the old men.
When they talk nonsense, it is almost touching.
She has bag purple, isn't it?
Are you sure that there is a woman?
Certainly, yes.
Oh, is it? Truth? Are you sure?
Do not have much time that we met.
Cute this bow tie.
No, it is ridiculous.
He put it to me please because it is a tradition.
- to Stop drinking, dear. - What is it?
On top is a wino?
Unless your wife.
But my wife is different. She is an alcoholic.
Good, let's go.
- I'm going to lie down. - But, daddy...
Good night.
And the present?
You will give you ready!
My gift is to be alone. When I see you,
I don't know in which world I live. This made me desperate.
A world in decomposition, in which
the maid is in the kitchen.
Wherever she is? In Elisha?
Shit!
Forgive Me. For other reasons, I also go to bed.
Oh, no! Already? Why?
- I'm tired. - Began to get fun.
Feel that ass around, immediately.
Not going to lie down before you touch the Christmas song.
No Christmas song, mother. I beg and implore you.
I can withstand everything, but I respect the tradition!
What song is this?
- Sophie, walk!!! - No, mother, please.
Silent! Going to sing!
it Was on Christmas day That Jesus was born
it Was on Christmas day That Jesus was born
He was born in a small corner On the straw
What are you doing here?
I can't sleep. And you, what are you doing?
- Smoking a cigarette. - Here in this house this evening?
I was invited to.
What jokes are these?
First went out with my friend and now with my brother.
- What is the plan? - Why? It is forbidden to
- if in love? - Is in love with him?
- Are you jealous? - do you Think that I like you?
I wonder.
It is strange for a subject to accuse a woman
bedtime with his brother.
You care if I sleep with him?
- Stop! - Multiple times per day.
please. - In complex positions?
Gives Me disgust!
- me too, a little.
- And why do you do it?
What you like in Antoine?
He has no humor, not interested in anything.
- I Love his nose. - we Have noses the same.
So maybe that is why.
Will have sex with the whole family?
Your father is nothing evil.
- You lack the pride.  You lack moral.
Sarah? What does that mean?
- Nothing. - You kissed her.
- no way.
- So, not kissed her?
- Not. - Climb up here.
- Why? What was that? - Got mad?
- Not touch him, be nice. - Go to the shit!
- do Not talk so. - I Speak as you want,
- is my girlfriend. - do Not talk so.
- She is not girlfriend. - what are you up to?
- All right, calm. - He is giving up on her.
- what happened? - There was that she is a slut.
- Who? - I.
- But of course. - what do you do here?
We are waiting for the Santa Claus.
Will wait too because it does not exist.
By that she said that he does not exist?
- Thing grandmother. - Need to tell people soon.
- So that count? - After you will be disappointed.
- You already knew? - Yes.
- It does not exist! - Let's going?
there is nothing more exciting than to flee in the night
with the man that we love.
Good day, lord. Lord, I'm sorry... Lord!
I'm sorry to bother you.
It has a bedroom, please?
They're in love, it gives pleasure to see.
- Completely. - Is, and makes for a very long time.
I spent two idiots to get it.
I'm sorry.
CHAPTER 3 THE ECSTASY
And was...
A fiasco.
He never knew, but as he was clumsy.
I don't know why he amassava my face that way.
there is, indeed, something less jubilant.
I thought that was vulgar.
And a little aggressive.
It took...
Will, relax.
It was long, long...
Yes, ready.
The following has improved, but...
In the beginning, frankly, it was... slow.
Drug, will!
The that had "the following"?
The following... Is boring.
- Why? - Because we were happy.
Smile to me.
- Of new? - Yes.
This is not enough. Will have more effect on you.
- I I beg. - Not.
- Why? - Because yes.
Now, you will need to hold out several years
based on a few qualities.
A bit like being on top of a wire epicuriano.
If I indulge all their desires,
I fear that you will quickly have erection problems.
You smiling it is enough for me.
- Smile to me. - Not.
- Victor! - Smile to me or I jump.
- Victor, stop. - Smile or I loose.
Wants to talk philosophy?
- Victor, climb. - Second Epictéte,
our story will be a long agony.
If you read Schopenhauer, in 3 months you me a large.
- So, smile for me. - go up, I beg and implore you.
Smile for me.
her smile, our!
When she smiles, it's like a juke box.
Makes you want to shove a coin.
can't imagine the state of excitement
she let me.
Do not talk of sex, this is not it.
But she loves to make love with me.
From the first night I felt. There is something very strong between us.
But it is not just up to write she inspires me.
I Have new ideas all the time.
are sometimes hers, sometimes mine.
You must be a idiot to think
that an intelligent woman esclerosa the ego.
Just being mediocre, small.
on The other hand, if the sum, multiply.
We climb with the words.
It does not mean that we are to live in comfort.
Without a father, I do not have the means to fix the bathroom.
I need to go pee.
To piss just going up two floors. Is hard.
But what the hell. In the morning I have fun,
the middle of the day I have fun, at night I have fun.
I Have everything what I dreamed.
I don't need more of you.
- If you say so. - Not drinking.
This girl is vodka.
I Love everything she says, how she looks at people,
the movies...
She follows the movement.
Say, the guy is gorgeous, she sucks.
Say, mate Anne Frank, she kills.
How you say something like that? She was the head of the Resistance.
She made me cum with a reasoning.
Ready?
- Take care. - Look what we will do.
Sossega. It was only a car.
It was not nothing. Sossegue.
The serious stuff began in a parisian Café.
CHAPTER 4 ADJUSTMENTS
I'll remember them forever.
- I Have a present for you. - Saw who is in it?
it Was Serge Gainsbourg.
And is already drunk.
When you think that he ate Bardot, Gréco, France Gall...
Look at that! They must love the music.
I think it's very sexy.
- do You find sexy?
- Of Course!
- Sexy?
- Of Course!
- Could go out and kiss him? - Not, I am with you.
Is with me, isn't it? Great, because in truth...
- what is it? - Nothing is fake,
but it is fancy, it seems.
it Is giving me a jewel? - Yes.
- Why? - I don't know.
It seems that people when in love
feel the need to materialize this.
It is a form of the bourgeois to say "I love You".
I love you too.
I Think that is the first time that I feel so well.
See how happy I am.
But, only a little question.
What will you do with Marion?
Marion?
It would be very nice if you largasse Marion.
- Who? - Marion.
Who is it?
Your little friend, Marion.
That you find regularly, 2 or 3 times per week.
- How will you? - is Never simple, it is true.
Half redhead, half banal...
Not love you more Marion.
- Why do not the large. - I would like to.
For me it would be much more simple.
But I want to preserve my harmony with Sarah.
I knew full well that loyalty was not strong to him.
But he closed his eyes?
It was 1973, another time.
Don't make that face, dear.
I know that is out of habit.
Simone de Beauvoir tied
be the first to instinct of property.
And even if inwardly was wanting to cut the dick,
it is always more effective to do things with a smile.
Her body is no big thing.
You are criticizing Gainsbourg, but Marion is not Jane Fonda.
If not for the complex,
I'm happy to know that he was with all.
But now, I would like that to stop.
So you sleep with the two.
No! Yes, yes, actually, yes.
But... I'm Not of the truth who lies down with Marion.
- Not? - Is the I of before,
- is the I before of Sarah. - Oh, that one...
It is annoying to drop a woman, even more when it is ugly.
I ask that tomorrow evening to find my parents,
I can introduce you to someone who is faithful.
It is normal for your wife to watch the query?
I'm sorry, it was the day off of her.
- Prefer that I...? - no, No.
Will do this tomorrow?
I promise.
Perfect!
- A old whiskey? - Yes.
- of Course not? - Yes.
The Goncourt Academy has assigned
the Goncourt award to Patrick Modiano.
No!
- Children of the mother! - what?
Just give the Goncourt Patrick Modiano.
I can't believe it!
- so what?
- And then that is scandalous!
I have read this book of old.
He has no audacity in the way, no vision of society.
- He writes like a grandpa.
- And why the anger?
It is because it is the most important award
in this country of shit! Anarchy.
Those who remember Modiano here 10, 20 years?
- what is this, a tie? - I don't know, it's a tie.
It is not cocktail party, we go to my parents ' house.
- Exact, it is chic. - does Not need to be fancy.
They are not chic.
- it does Not hurt, I'm here. - what?
I'm going to stay here. Not have the right to do this to them.
- Do what they do? - to Hurt them.
Can't make it to his parents. Look for you.
They put in the world a girl exceptional.
You is kind, beautiful, cultured...
And you take them one poor fellow, a writer failed.
I'm jealous of the whole Earth.
Need to wait for your Goncourt for you to submit?
Never going to win the Goncourt.
The heck with the Goncourt. It is just a shit.
Victor delighted in autodifamação.
- You are not bourgeois. - no way.
- In fact, they are jews. - what?
It is for you to know. They are good jews.
- Oh, is it? - In fact, quite the same.
So you are also...
Of course. Why?
Nothing. It's just that you never mentioned.
I didn't know that was so important.
I am not a practitioner, I don't believe it, I...
Do not worry, it is...
I'm just a little surprised.
But dear, my name is Sarah Adelman.
Oh, it is. This is due to.
I heard your name, but I...
- This is the problem? - no way, on the contrary.
As well, unlike?
- I said, "unlike"? - Spoke.
Pleases I be jewish?
- Oh, no. - Not?
Yes! I don't know... I...
- I'm Not interested. - does Not matter to you?
No, no. I'm interested in!
I said that it should not by the entries first.
Now there's more hunger.
How so? The entire world is hungry!
You're still hungry, Victor?
What?
In French, daddy, in French!
They want to know if you still have hunger.
Sincerely is very good. Thank you very much.
I spent the afternoon preparing everything!
I was thrilled to see it there, where I grew up.
He was more comfortable with their complex financial statements.
The kindness of my parents leveled
to the modest budgets that they had.
As if it says "gefilte"?
There is not a word, it does not hurt, it is fish.
Look at how she gets beautiful when it gets angry!
I'm not angry, daddy. All is well.
See this beauty, Victor.
See the beauty of these two women.
Impossible to say which is the more beautiful.
You could write a book of 5 volumes
to compare these two beauties.
And not even I told you, mom.
She looks at me with a bit of fixing.
This boy is slim.
Well slim.
- Chaim! Health! - Chaim.
- Chaim. - Congratulations!
-- Sarah? - Yes.
Are you sure that it is not the tail?
Grandma! What story is this?
What was that?
Grandma found you very fine-grained.
Thank you very much, lady. Thank you.
For that he thanked me?
I took care of the tail!
Mother, how can you speak so?
- Ready, enough already. - Now the dessert.
Dessert!
That night he realized,
a new world opening up to him.
Here is the coffee.
Can borrow.
You can take what you want, I have everything.
Isaac Bashevis Singer.
I also have Bernard Malamud, Albert Cohen, Saul Bellow,
- Georges Perec... - Why give him only
- jewish writers?
- So that it read the best.
I can also give him Marguerite Yourcenar.
She is not jewish and is very good, also.
Writers non-jews are very, very smart.
But the jewish writers are funny and smart.
For example, Philip Roth.
- Do You Know? - I've Heard a lot, caught this.
Have you read Portnoy?
- No, I have not read. - it Is the best book of him.
Has an incredible chapter about masturbation.
He is in the bathroom like an idiot...
giving a tract on the stick...
Forgive Me, my dear, but you are able to to be political,
intelligent and poetic, speaking of jacking off?
Only a jew to do this.
Albert Cohen, Saul Bellow, Isaac Bashevis Singer,
Bernard Malamud, Georges Perec...
Sarah!
Sarah?
I think that I am a jew.
What?
- I feel jewish. - Stop, it's too late.
I'm serious.
- I Love your family. - I know. Already spoke three times.
It is not that I love, they are everything that I love.
All the people who have suffered, who just missed dying.
- Victor, come to sleep. - do You realize?
They were expelled from Germany, Poland, France, India,
and still think of that laugh.
Your father has a reason.
It is possible to be fun and smart.
I love this mood, the despair, the connection with the family,
this coexistence, a form of expression.
I love all of the jews.
Victor, arrives. I have proof partial early tomorrow.
And what you are talking about has no meaning.
There is so much idiot among the jews. I'll present my uncle
that is not funny.
It is the face of Alain Peyrefitte and only talks shit. Is a null.
- Sarah, listen to only that. - what?
I knew that one out of every three awards nobéis
were given to jewish writers?
From where you took this?
It is not by chance that it is the first time in my life
I'm in love.
Then it is because I am jewish?
I do not say this, but it is strange, he admits, is sui generis.
You only speak nonsense.
I need to write.
- Are 3h in the morning!
- so what?
I have already lost too much time.
I lay curled up next to Rebecca,
whose sleep seemed to be released, quieted.
And if that night in August of 1944
became finally the page from the tears and the fear?
Our grunting pushing the moustache of the Führer,
the boots of officers, and the sobs of my mother.
from tomorrow, the end of the names are borrowed.
Nothing more than dictatorship.
Here it ends, for Rebecca and I, the tour in the house of fools.
The Foot-of-the-pig-French...
left for Us half a century to dance
in the ashes of our grandfathers.
In MAY 1974
Each day has its polling.
This morning in the Figaro, a survey by Sofres.
This Wednesday, the results confirm
trends in the beginning of the campaign.
François Mitterrand, has 44%, or increased by 2%.
Valéry Giscard d'estaing has 31%, up by 3%.
Jacques Chaban-Delmas, 17% and Jean Rayer, 3%.
These last two in low.
CHAPTER 5 THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS
But what is it?
What is inventing?
Victor.
What is it? His grandparents sent to Auschwitz?
- Wait. - Killed in Auschwitz?
- Is fiction, my dear. - That fiction?
- Is a character. - Which One? Everything is in the 1st person.
And so what? Saul Bellow also writes in the 1st person.
It is, but Saul Bellow is a jew.
But I feel jewish.
I am a novelist and I feel jewish.
But you are not jewish!
Drug! We do not give a damn about religion.
You have talent and would have even being buddhist.
I hate religion and the ghettos intellectuals.
I spent my childhood listening to my father saying
that we were the best, the funniest,
the most unhappy and the most misunderstood.
That the best food was the jew,
that the jews make love better.
Can be...
BY VICTOR ADELMAN But what is this?
- Victor Adelman? - Yes.
- Who is he? - Improves the sound.
"Adelman" sounds better than "Richemont", don't you think?
It is softer, it is more...
He got mad. Is the evil of the head, and you need to treat.
I loved the idea of having children called as "Richemont".
"Richemont" sounds literary, doesn't it?
Of Richemont evokes mansions in Touraine.
Makes Me think of hunting scenes, duels of aristocrats,
- intrigues in castles...
- Precisely, not.
What is important to the sound?
Sarah, it is also for the love that I want to have his last name.
- Oh, is it? - You said yourself.
Why always have the wife using the husband's last name?
I defend women, I defend the abortion,
I support equality.
But this is not equality. The name of this is "theft".
Are you telling me that Victor Adelman was not a jew?
Not more than you is not a redhead.
And how can no one have discovered?
Because journalists don't work right.
You are not asking the right questions.
- My God. - it's Not your fault.
And what does it change?
The Village Uncomfortable is one of the best books
on the ashkenazes in the post-war period.
And with reason, for it is the portrait of my grandparents.
Okay, you can come in.
Why the crying?
Because it is very good.
Truth? Like?
- Very Much.
- Of all?
Everything.
Right. And now?
- what, and now what? - criticism.
- I? - I'm listening.
Here we go...
Page... Page 1.
All the paragraphs about clothes, put them in the present.
- All paragraphs? - Yes, it would be much stronger.
Then, nothing to say to page 2.
"This heaven, unraveling my despair..."
It is not through pompous?
- Is a poetic license. - Yes, but...
I've never seen a sky challenge my despair.
Page 3, nothing to say. It is wonderful.
Ah, yes, one thing, your issues with adverbs.
"Truly," "topsy-turvy"...
I receive today a young author
that achieved a great success
NOVEMBER 1974
with The Village Queasy from the Publisher Grasset.
Being compared to Philip Roth
and to the great writers of american jews.
- Victor Adelman, good night. - Good night.
... removed from the memories of the family environment...
Good day. As it is, it happened.
The Goncourt award has been awarded to Victor Adelman
by The Village Uncomfortable. An award that...
- Mr. Adelman! - Yes, yes, yes.
Look, I just know. I...
I must thank also to the members of the jury
and a thought my addresses
to someone who means a lot to me.
She's called Sarah, and I am ready to marry her.
- You're going to get married? - If she will consent, yes.
The walls have been completely repainted.
A fireplace in each side...
Mr. Adelman...?
Open your book, thank you.
- Has a thing...
- So. Very well.
Wait.
So it is best to.
Let's turn to pose with the book.
QUOTIDIEN CHIRAC LOSES HIS TOOTH
This color is a shit, isn't it?
It does not to move. You want to feel?
Well here.
As it is beautiful.
- As it is beautiful. - we Went to the doctor today.
And it was all good?
Told that everything is fine. I am sure that he will not.
- Not have what? - trombidiose.
- The what? - I Already talked about about 10 times.
- You do not listen? - But what is the trombidiose?
Is that something genetic from my mother and my grandmother.
What this causes?
In the beginning attacks the glands.
Sometimes shrinks the part of the genital...
Genitals? Is playing?
- Yes. - Not.
- Yes. - That drug! No!
- Forgiveness. - I do Not believe.
- Forgiveness. Sorry. - no, you can't.
No one touches the genitals of my son.
No, he's going to have a sex very cute.
- A sex as well large. - Yes, well great.
- Will yes. - As of my father.
Is? No kidding, your family has problems
- neurological, brain? - No, stop with the bullshit.
Sossegue, he will be very smart.
- Very clever, yes. - A great surgeon.
Surgeon... A great writer is better.
What would he write?
In Search Of Lost Time.
We wanted to perfect.
In we argued on a complete projection of a narcissistic.
Tell him: Ulises de James Joyce.
The ulysses of Joyce. The ulysses of Joyce.
And Beautiful Of the Lord of Albert Cohen.
I wonder if my love for Victor was not in part
due to the genetic qualities
that he could bequeath to our children.
CHAPTER 6 THE MIRACLE OF LIFE
- Sorry, on that walk is? - Started the labor.
Give everything to the right. Want to come?
I'm going to. Thank you.
- Something wrong? - Nothing, thank you.
It's just that my wife will give birth.
- I Understand.  it Is hot in here, isn't it?
I don't know if it is for the babies that they go up a little...
- Is the first? - Yes.
It is strange, isn't it?
Here a while I will have a teenager
all disproportionate and full of pimples.
You incomodaria give a...
- no way, thank you.
My poor Victor.
Want to manage a birth, and the recent notoriety.
- To whom? - Hortence.
As it is hard to be a man.
Where is it?
- Where is he? - Is coming.
Is coming.
My husband, where is he?
I'm going to be a daddy. Wow, that's crazy!
I'm going to be a father.
- Where were you? - Bathroom, sorry.
I wanted to, my, my... My love.
- Congratulations! I love you so much. - Also love you.
- Look. - can Not be.
It can't be. But it is so small!
- This is my son? - Yes.
Oh, my God. You are my child?
That little thing all sticky...
Going to wash it, right?
Don't you think he with the face of Nobel prize?
Yes, a guy Nobel prize.
The Nobel prize is attributed to... Arthur!
Arthur Dostoevsky.
Is Dostoevsky.
But he realized soon
that their child not write The Brothers Karamazov.
It is still too early to give an opinion.
It is true that in this case
the educational process is particularly long, but...
But no one is safe from surprises.
The waking of a child is a relative notion.
To begin with, he speaks.
What he speaks of is still little, but not neglect
the state of onomatopoeia.
And the lord thinks that he will be able to incorporate
the school course more or less normal?
No, no.
You will need a little patience.
We're talking about... for several years.
Patience and more patience.
Is what I have to say: patience.
You! Stop it!
What he meant to say is that is a retarded.
He did not say so. Only said that it is to take care of.
Take care. What does this mean?
- We take care all the time. - I don't Know.
Breast...
Victor plunged the concerns over cocktails literary.
He pretended to give more importance
the employment of the semicolon that the problem of our son.
He immersed himself in the writing.
His new novel had
the life sinister of a mother of a family,
a nobleman, alcoholic, and uneducated in the XX.
"Misled by the husband, hated by their daughter,
despised by the children, this Mme. Bovary of the poor,
puffy white wine,
prejudice, racist and hatred repressed,
he vomits all of her love to the only being in the world
to reveal even a crumb of consideration:
a dog dwarf brand chiuaua known for their loyalty,
profound idiocy and breath terrible."
This narrative, brief and fierce,
arrived in bookstores at the end of the summer.
in Spite of the care taken in changing the name,
the region and the color of the hair,
the mother of Victor was a little disturbed.
Tchouky. Tchouky.
Lay down, my dear. "Don't move."
Forgiveness, my love.
Brothel of shit.
Fills Me with!
Brothel of shit.
Gentlemen!
Some books, it is already known,
are as deadly as a bullet.
I didn't know that one day I would suffer the consequences.
This.
Go, go look.
The day started well.
Gentlemen...
The father of Victor always supposed to
Sylvie fell to water the plants
and never read a single line of the book.
Victor pretended to believe.
But he has not slept for 14 weeks.
THE LIPS COLD
The two novels were translated in 17 countries.
I stopped studying.
We moved many times.
CHAPTER 7 THE MONEY
I Think that for a period
the success of Victor me up a little bit to the head.
Mainly in the day that I decided to buy.
this huge home in Chantilly.
it Was a house that seemed not with us.
But that may be finished to resemble it.
He travelled widely to promote their books.
As for me, I gave laps around myself.
Good day, boss, can I help you?
No, thank you.
Sweetheart, my love, I'm back.
Thank you very much, thank you.
Thank you.
And so what? Tell us what you did while I was not, dear?
I have not done a lot of thing, you know?
- I Speak a lot with Arthur. - Yes.
- He is progressing a lot. - The Truth?
Is. It does not to amaze me.
It is amazing.
Oh, it is! Not told you.
I started a course in dance hindu.
It is an ingenious thing!
It is true! Obliges you to work
about focusing, on breathing...
It is amazing.
- And I feel much better. - That's good to know.
There is an exercise that I love, and on which account
up to 5 and then back.
I say 1, you say 2.
And at a certain moment, if you replace 2 by "zip".
1...
- Zip. - Zip.
1, zip, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, zip, 1, zip, 3, 4, 5
After you replace the 4 by a slap on the leg.
Very fast: 1, zip, 3, slap 5, slap, 3, zip, 1, zip, 3, etc.
- And you? It was cool the China? - Enthralling.
- The Truth? - Enthralling even.
The food there is good?
It is the chinese.
- what does this mean? - Very rice-based.
It's a cliché, but verified.
I love rice.
- 1, zip, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3...?
- Zip.
Very well!
- Good morning, lord! - Good day.
Dear? I'm back.
all
" my votes for the warm...
Thank You, Floriane. It was divine!
I would add a desire,
that those of us who have the luck
have happiness and health
" don't forget those who are less advantaged.
Who is Hortense?
Dear, you just greet her.
- been here for a year. - Was it?
- And he, the lord, that I...
- Édouard?
- what it does? - Well... I don't know.
Good day, lord.
Good day.
Dear... there are many dogs here.
Then, the Rouard that came.
Five days.
She has 9 dogs...
"Adrien interrupted Sophie
and asked her to by the fire in the house.
He gives her the matches and the strength to see you burn
all of your commitments.
The sofa Le Corbusier, dishes of porcelain,
the hairstyle Farrah Fawcett, etc."
And then I said to him:
"I'm not going to pretend that I liked if not it is good."
Of course not.
When you travel again?
- the day After tomorrow. - Already?
Is traveling more and more.
Is.
When I'm here, fill the bag.
How?  Me hate.
- in a little while, I am getting angry. - But...
I don't know what happens.
I no longer have nor desire to return.
Even a little bit.
- Are you serious? - Yes, very serious.
We have become very, very serious.
Oh, is it?
Not noticed?
Not. But if you are saying...
I don't know, is...
- Maybe it's the house. - what, the house?
I don't know, this life...
- Be in the field...
- no, this is Not.
I love the field. Gives Me the will to write.
Let's not live in the Champs Elysées
to not to get a bag full!
What is it with you, exactly?
Look at me. Sarah, look here.
Did lobotomy? They took out your brain?
Why do you say that?
Because you it was fun, it was original.
Don't care for the stories of ecology,
be a friend of so-and-so to receive such a...
Is anybody there?
- Is me listening to? - Wants to separate?
Of course not! I want to have fun.
I just want to share things with you, I want to laugh like before.
If you have found someone...
No, this is not. Stop.
I love your body, you know very well.
Could spend years groping your breasts.
However, now it is just this that I love.
It is only talk and is no longer the same.
If you saw your look...
You remind me of my mother.
- I? - You know, I have a journal.
I walked rereading to check.
Makes 7 and a half months that you ceased to interest me.
Just ask me
if you are happy in me reunited.
Is playing? I can only hope so.
I think about it every day.
Then rehearse before the replicas,
why not swallow any of it.
The drawbacks of dogs, the stories of the frames,
And all of these employees? Frankly, what is it?
I am a writer of the Left.
I just ask for votes for François Mitterrand.
I wrote in Libération, defending immigrants!
And when you get home have the impression to be Louis XIV.
To begin with, why do you only hire blacks?
This here is not a plantation!
By any chance use a hat colonial?
I'm going to say goodbye to everyone.
He felt a pleasure almost sexual, making me suffer.
This kid boy rich was convinced
that he spoke in the name of the French people,
of the unemployed, of workers,
and of all those with whom he would not spend not one hour.
You are the woman more crazy that I knew.
Why do you want to look like Anne-Aymone Giscard D'estaing?
Go to the shit! Are you listening to talk and see what hurts?
"You know what? You have reason. I do not know who I am.
I was not made to be rich and I don't want to be poor,
but I was not made for this life.
I don't know what happened.
You have reason. Swallow everything,
so I can even try the shit!
Sorry.
In addition, this child makes me crazy.
There it is!
If I said that is because I love you.
I am pregnant.
What?
Not, leave! I gather alone!
Climb with me.
Eat Me on the table, now!
Hortense, take the boy to the room.
it Was the first time he spoke to me in that tone.
I was pissed
but he was out of the question to lose my husband.
So I sold the mansion and said goodbye to the four employees.
- Dear, ready to go? - I'll.
And in myself, I tried.
CHAPTER 8 VITAMINS OF THE HEART.
I'm ready.
You give him a bowl of milk.
He takes the milk?
Simply, it is so cold
men are hard all the time.
It is crazy what you can say and do
when you have the spirit alive and the heart as well lightweight.
Is not horny, gets hard from the cold.
The words flowed for you and my days are filled
as fast as my nostrils.
Mitterrand! Mitterrand!
In fact, this victory is in the first place
from the forces of youth,
Diamonds.
from the forces of work...
- Of the diamonds equal. - it Was a lot of luck.
- Thank You, Bokassa. - Viva diamonds.
Today is a historic day.
Up to you, Jean-Marc.
Now, embebedem for me,
because this night I want you to vomit.
Jean-Marc, you don't get out of here before dirtying my carpet.
I had found the pecha and everyone liked it.
- Where are you going, love? - to Do pipi.
New? She is emptying? Amazing!
Attention! If someone don't like my roast,
it will take a slap in the face.
- Up to you, mother. - Mostly you, by the way.
Because this here, I've cooked with passion.
- Calm down a little bit. - "Calm down, calm down!"
Father, can not stay happy? After all, Mitterrand won.
- be Careful with the knife. - Yes.
The beef is good, isn't it? I love this, it is very good.
Not as that arrives. For me, eat all day.
Until the moment it became visible.
I love the flesh of cattle. I could eat from morning to night.
Unfortunately, there is always a time in which the motor gets stuck
and the look of people come to spoil our party.
- My dear? - it is Not nothing.
Stop! Care, stop!
- what happened? - burst open the bag.
- Not. - My love, I think that yes.
What are you doing Arthur?
What are you doing with my dress?
How long have you been using drugs?
- Can we talk later? - no, we can't.
- for how long, Sarah? - Do strength.
- I don't know. Five, six months. - does Not have cystitis in the truth?
- Not. - Push, push.
Why did he do this?
Wanted to make you laugh. You said that I changed.
I thought it was a screwdriver. I was afraid to let me go.
How could you do this while pregnant?
- The head appeared. - Exactly.
2 parents in 7 goes to the woman during the pregnancy.
Here it is, it is a beautiful little girl.
With all this she will be a junkie.
She is normal? Will be that she can talk?
- Dear, is a baby. - A baby drugged.
Fortunately, the baby had no sequel.
Was a child quite alive.
Our son is that it gives us a lot of hassle.
CHAPTER 9 THE PROBLEM
On Friday, he bit a cat.
- Bite a cat? - Yes, even bleed.
He doesn't want to share the workshop with the mongoloides.
And on another day, he urinated in the case of the small Benjamin.
Your child is not silly.
- Yes?
- And as he speaks very little
and can stand hours looking at us without moving.
We can think of that is distant, but not.
He is present, very present, matutando.
Hesitate, hesitate, look, measure, and hesitate.
But he is not stupid. However, it is extremely bad.
- I'm Sorry. - Think grace, Mr. Adelman?
No, I don't think. I apologize. Are the nerves, sorry.
This makes you nervous... The us also.
And it also leaves the Sra. Herrera nervosa.
Since the day that Arthur tried to have a relationship with her.
- A relationship? - Carnal, yes, my lady.
The Sra. Herrera is a woman of formidable,
with more than 70 years...
- I don't think grace, Mr. Adelman. - I'm Sorry.
Is a woman of more than 70 years, with a defect in the hip,
and Arthur made gestures nothing misconceptions with it.
- But is an only child. - Yes, it is just a child.
Lady, he has behaviors that are not of a child.
Gives Me the shivers.
- I Think that he is capable of anything. - Seriously? To this point?
I don't know, maybe we can do something to help him?
What to do with a wild animal?
The blue. Take it, is the blue.
Where will you put the blue? Very well, my love.
Look at this. She is amazing.
Just look at this fire in their eyes.
They don't glow, they are incandescent.
You is beautiful too. Who is the cleverer?
- it is Not Marguerite Duras. - I Am.
Not the Nathalie Sarraute. Is...
- I Am. - Is you, is you my love.
You are the most intelligent.
- because he looks like that? - Is the sister, is normal.
Does he know who is the sister? He understood that this is your sister?
Who is the girl? How it is called?
Think, how is called the blonde girl and cute who is here?
The small hill with the face of wino.
It has nothing to do with it that spoke.
Who is she? It is an easy question.
- Is an idiot. - Stop!
Yes, yes, is an idiot.
They say that he is kind of special, but not stupid. Lie!
The other night, put poop of the dog in the mashed carrot.
He eats cats, damn! He eats cats!
This is the problem with it, is an idiot.
If I were autistic, I would write
a book about him and we would be rich.
But there is nothing to tell. He has a below average IQ.
But insufficient to receive
the rent of the government. Your an idiot.
- Idiot. - Idiot.
- Idiot. - Yes. This is for sure.
- Idiot. - Idiot.
most parents would be outraged
seeing a father speaking thus to the son of 9 years.
- Now I'm not going to say. - Idiot.
Just that most of the parents did not spend 9 years
with a child as he.
You make me disappoint as much as François Mitterrand.
That's right, the Left in power. The socialist Party.
- girlfriend. - Expect both
and we ended up with the guy on the floor. What are we going to do, fuck?
Nothing. What you want to do?
Is it too late to abort. We will not do nothing, we will love it.
We will love it as much as we can.
Torro my days with him, I'm glued to it.
I have to love it. It is my son.
And I love him.
- Shit! Everything well? - Yes, it is nothing.
Daddy hair.
What is it "dad hair"? What is it "dad hair"?
What did she say? I am losing hair?
No, it's because of the inputs, this is normal.
The entries?
- Let it ride alone. - More slowly. More slowly.
- More slowly, my love.  Release.
Yes, yes. Yes!
Caution!
Going to father, nothing to soften it. Let's go, let's go.
Let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Is getting worse. Each time worse.
Since she was born I've been terrified.
All these news about the depraved narcissists,
on the Gulf war, the radioactive cloud from Chernobyl.
Where is this cloud? Walking on top of it.
And the unemployment to increase.
Yes, Victor, if you permit me, she only has 13 years.
Yes, but it grows so quickly.
You know doctor, sometimes I don't want to know what they say
about the need for socialization of children.
Sometimes I want to lock her in a basement.
- in A basement? - Not a basement sordid.
I imagine a sort of underground world,
full of books, with a small cinema room.
A burrow where no one could hurt her emotionally,
- where you would never have problems. - A ring for your daughter?
And why not?
The other day I had a dream, horrible.
Passed-if in the future, she was 17 years old,
I was in a room, completely helpless,
inside a small bath and around her, all naked,
were Charles Pasqua, Patrick Poivre d'arvor
and Michel Rocard, drug! Looked at it with eyes!
Began to give blows in her face
as if my daughter was a slut.
Then, I arrived, picked up a shotgun
and I made a massacre.
I killed the whole world. It was monstrous.
What I try to say is that I can not stand the idea
let her grow up in a world so obscene.
In a world obsessed by sex and money to this point.
It is not by chance that I lose all my hair.
And then this mustache...
It is to compensate?
Oh, yeah... hadn't thought of that.
You know what Freud said about the mustache?
Not.
That was a form of implant
of pubic female on the mouth.
The reach of the language.
- And his wife? - Yes?
As she sees the symbolic relationship between you and your daughter?
All is well.
It is increasingly new. It seems rejuvenated.
This also makes me distressed.
the Other day we were in the bathroom.
CHAPTER 10: THE INVERSION OF THE CURVE OF DESIRE
In the beginning, I looked like a movie actor who wrote the books.
Remember? Now, I look like even a writer.
Stop it. You are gorgeous.
In fact, we change. You are increasingly beautiful
- and I'm getting horrible. - You come to bed?
What is happening is unexpected.
Look at his nose, is shrinking. Will stay sexy.
- You come to bed? - I will end up horned.
Horned and bald.
- You are beautiful too. - do Not tell nonsense.
- There are bald magnificent. - Yes?
- Yes. - Who?
Do not think about. If you need to think it is because it is not obvious.
I don't want to know.
Not I fell in love with your hair.
Oh, is it? Fell in love with the that, then?
- The Jacques Chirac. - what?
He is bald and alluring.
- Oh, you like Chirac? - No, nothing like that.
- I'm talking about physically. - Physically like him, is it?
Stop it. Never voted for him,
but this has nothing to do with the baldness of it.
Anyway, you know what I think.
- About what? - About couples.
- Of the freedom in the couple. - Yes?
I mean, if you are worried
with some wear and tear sexual, I know that would cost me,
but I prefer you to consume pleasure
one or two times per year with an unknown,
than you imagine fantasizing the whole day.
I'm only talking about if you quench,
a kind of hygiene physiological.
I guess not if you can separate sex from feeling.
- Can yes. - Yes? How do you know?
I don't know, I suppose. And sometimes I masturbate.
My love, is me boasting? I know that masturbates
- thinking about other women. - Speak low.
She still hasn't slept, is listening.
Admit that there is a gap
between the fact of masturbating and I have sex with a friend?
- By a friend of mine? - I do Not know anyone else.
So have you ever thought of having sex with a friend?
Of course not.
- Only if it were a joke. - play?
The whole time I'm imagining fucks with whole world.
My teachers, my friends, my father...
- what? - Is a mental exercise,
it is a projection, for a few seconds.
- Up with your father? - IS.
I do not say that I liked, until I felt bad.
But I can't seem to avoid.
- Up with Francois, for example? - No, François is married.
Is your editor and godfather of our daughter.
- But in your head? - Yes.
With the whole world. Another day was with the electrician.
No, but with Francois how was it?
Was weird.
- But possible? - Yes, of course.
- Technically, everything is possible.
- So, are you safe?
- Not. - Yes, you are safe.
Not to hurt the bald here.
You're an idiot.
Good night.
- what are you doing? - Is terrible, because...
When I imagine you with Francois,
this causes something.
Stop!
- You don't want to? - no, I'm Not the end.
Was what I said.
Where are you going? - I'm going to work.
I know that I am not Dostoevsky, but I need to work.
If I were to Dostoevsky, I would want to?
- Good night. - He was completely bald.
But that genius, isn't it?
The talent of my husband would not stop to decrease.
Had increasingly difficulties in finding ideas.
At night, I would hear him shouting against the lack of inspiration....
But that shit!
- And if we can? - I, in the French Academy?
This thing is to old. Is completely outdated.
To cite a writer which you like at the Gym. Only one.
- I'm listening. - Yes, he has reason.
Is a nursing home. Is to die for.
- Yes, he is not wrong. - I Think that I am still alive.
In your case, my dear,
I don't know if it is the old, the children
or the love, but you are stunning.
- Thank You. - I can't stop saying that to her.
She is getting more beautiful.
My wife is becoming more beautiful.
Will eat more cheese? Are you sure?
Why? Afraid that I engorde? It is inevitable.
I get older and shoutout & tell. I'm going to drink more wine.
I am a writer, I'm not a supermodel.
I would like to have been, but I am a writer.
When we see the sales of my last book...
- Victor, stop. - what do you want?
There is nothing new to be done about anything.
- Victor. - what? It is not true?
Everything has already been done. The style spoken, drugged,
porn scenes, incest, violence, everything.
The irony of the Left, Right, of the jews, of the arabs,
women, redheads, corsos, pussy, everything.
It is, we've already done everything.
People already don't read. Everyone writes and no one reads.
- As Well. - There it is.
The mass is ended.
- Happy birthday, François. - Happy birthday.
Health. - François is not evil?
- is Not evil? - Is true.
- Physically the same. - Thank You.
You've never been beautiful, got it.
Your fall will not be great.
It is true, Francois, not told you?
My wife dreams of fucking with you.
- what? - that's Not what I said?
Is drunk? Sorry, he only speaks nonsense.
- Maryse, I never said this. - it does Not hurt. It is strange.
That's what she told me.
I never would invent such a thing, my love. Take.
I have not said that dreamed of, said that I imagined.
Yes, she does that with everyone. Any one serves.
She imagines. Even with his own father.
It was crazy. Now they think that I am nymphomaniac.
Sorry lord, this is a space for non-smokers.
Space non-smokers? But what drug is this?
Never prevent people from smoking in the restaurant.
Take it, here it is. Thank you. There goes the police.
We can't smoke, drink, write,
not if it can be Left, can't eat.
Not if you can climb.
Well, I'm hungry. Here comes the dessert.
This animates. For whom is this cake?
I am the end. I'm going to do what I want.
I'm going to drink, I'll eat it.
With wine, with tobacco, I'm going to do everything.
Tired. I'm going to stop. I'm going to me though.
Happy birthday.
- Victor... - With him?
Victor is going through a very difficult period.
The two novels that he published were not successful.
we Discovered that the fame was only a small temptation.
- I Arrived. - everything Went well?
Well. I'm sick of crowds.
I get cramps after giving so many autographs.
Had too much people. Was the whole world.
- This pleases your readers. - what?
This pleases their readers.
It's crazy all the love that we have received.
Is so much love that it almost suffocates.
Bought the last book of the Clézio?
- Not bought, they have given me. - Clézio is a beautiful man.
It is very beautiful, it can not be denied.
As it is beautiful...
people convince themselves that we have moved away from them
because of your mistakes and weaknesses.
This makes it unpleasant.
Or we turn away from them because they become unpleasant.
- Where do you go? - You know very well.
- No, I do not know. - For the singing lessons.
I thought that was a painting class?
No, the painting is Wednesday night.
- You are beautiful. - Thank You.
It is good to have these courses, so you can leave the house.
I am sorry. Does not work, I take care of children...
I don't believe it. Where do you go?
- Victor. - Tell the truth.
- 'm late. - Waiting, waiting.
- what was that? - The children are with whom?
So it is that speaks to me? I am not a maid.
Is a maid? Tract you as a maid?
- Listen. I'm late. - Waiting, gives me a kiss.
- I don't want to. - Not?
There are 3 and a half months that we do not love.
- let's Not talk about it.
- And why not?
Because there are periods as well, you know very well.
We've been together for years, you won't always be.
And why not? Kiss me. Why can't it always be?
- Why can't it always be? - You smell the whiskey.
That is how to dress for the singing lessons?
Is singing at the Olympia?
Why high heels now? I thought that was very high.
I'm assuming, I'm not going to spend your life head down.
I mentioned that I would not be upset.
- what? - If walking with another person.
I'm going to is fall out.
Don't feel horny for me because I am not surprised.
- I I admire you. - Lie!
I chose the only woman who is not impressed
with what do I do with what I write, with what I think.
- I Chose the only one! - Go if you get a dumb.
If I were a woman would be so
that I might dress for a date.
And if I were a man he would do so to my wife I drop.
- you Will find those, Sarah? - Nobody.
- But I start to think about it. - There it is.
it Was here that he wrote all the novels misóginos.
A Heart Dry.
Be Wary Of A Woman Who Cries.
The High Heels Of The Devil.
The women stopped buying his books
and as the majority of readers are women.
Sell the car, the jewelry and some furniture.
One night, returning home,
it was the day of my birthday...
Congratulations to you
on This date dear
best wishes, Sarah
Many years of life
Sit down, my dear.
- Let us a toast, boy.  Health.
Health.
- Who are you? - Is Pablo.
- Pablo! - Pablo?
Pablo is his birthday gift.
I was looking for an idea and I thought,
that would give her more pleasure?
Pablo. I thought of Pablo.
- Is that a joke? - No, nothing like that.
On the contrary, Pablo is a professional. It is not Pablo?
Which is not my case. I am not a professional.
Arrives lying. Does not happen nothing between us.
Does not happen nothing between us.
Nothing more. Happened. A long time ago.
That is why I left the kids with my parents?
With them here it would be weird.
Or would you prefer with children?
- Is to do what? - I'm Not going to do a drawing,
you are already grown up.
Want to explain it to you
as if you put a penis in a vagina?
Victor, this is extremely embarrassing.
Listen my boy, I am sorry, but you can go though.
Do not get out of here, already paid for them.
I have the impression
this is not pleasing this lady.
Yes, yes, it is. She always is indignant.
- turned You into a depraved. - I'm Not the depraved.
Depraved is to be fuck by others hidden.
This is what is depraved.
This here is life. He is beautiful.
He is strong, muscular.
I don't know what a joke is inventing,
but I don't think it funny.
Does not leave me excited.
Talks too much. I want to have fun.
And you know what, I would be happy? Is see you have fun.
Finally.
Very well.
At the point that we no longer have anything to lose.
Even want to see me fuck another?
Yes. Anything but the monotony!
Anything but the monotony!
Anything but the monotony!
Go to the room, Pablito.
She likes to be licked.
I expect you to be good speaking,
because it can last for hours and hours.
You, my dear, is that it takes hours and hours.
Ah, the bastard.
Are you sure you want to continue?
Yes. Of course, yes.
Victor...
Victor.
Will be going there.
- Victor, look at me. - Yes, my love.
If you force me to go to the room,
just for always.
We?
Our, he is muscular.
- How much did it cost? - it Was expensive.
So, stop wasting time.
Want to sit down to see? It is better for your back.
Sit over there.
Walks, Pablo. Coming soon.
Wait, wait, wait, we are not teenagers.
Went crazy? Chilean kid! Get out of here!
Falls out, already said! Think that is what? Found the what?
Disappear! Think what?
Sorry! Sorry!
Sorry!
Forgiveness! Forgiveness!
For 20 years, I lived with the fear that he leave me.
it Was this fear that allowed me to love him for so long.
I Lost my fear.
CHAPTER 11 A NEW BEGINNING
Everything well?
The first lunch post-separation was not of the most joyous.
- You are a slut. - Our! He taught it well.
Your daughter is a true soldier.
- Without you, I'm going to die. - Heard what he said?
- He's going to die. - Chloe, one day you will understand
- that is not so simple. - Go though.
Here 6 months you come back crying, but it will be too late
because he will see that it doesn't need you.
You serve very well for each other.
A piece of advice, use a condom.
- Sarah. - I'm Sorry.
- puton! - is very Fond of this word.
- Father, I will wait for you at home. - No, please.
No, I'm going to. Let Me.
One last question, where do you keep the iron?
- On your rear. - Takes.
Please.
Do not do this, I beg and implore you.
I am sorry.
I'm going to change. I swear that I will change. Interest.
Too late. I did everything I could.
Without you, I'm going to die, Sarah.
Not going to die. Look at the bright side of things.
You complained about the life of the bourgeois,
now you can write another thing.
What the hell.
Come to the house. Sarah, you is my woman.
- Let's go to the house, walks. - Not.
- Will, come. - Stop.
- come on, now let's. - Stop. Stop!
- Stop, Victor! - come here, Come.
Stop!
- Moves. Now come on. - Stop!
- He is crazy. - Let's go home. I love you.
You over there, stop! Stop, is crazy?
Well, I'm going.
- I will pay the bill. - Let I paid.
Are you sure?
Up soon.
- I? - Yes, you can.
- Good day, doctor. - Mr. Adelman.
- Is friendly to come to visit me. - If I knew that was sick
it would have been before. How are you?
You know, they do what they can but...
And you, Victor, how's it going?
In fact, I'm going to be very ill.
- Can I sit down? - Yes.
Sarah left me, I exchanged it for another.
It seems that the world collapses. I'm tired.
Sorry, doctor, I know that is not a good time
but I can only speak with the lord.
I thought that she would never let me.
- I Thought that we were like...
- I don't want to know.
How? - does Not matter to me.
30 years ago I hear their stories.
I'm dying and you come fill me?
I can not die in peace? Damn!
I have spent my life listening to the angustias of the other,
couples who love each other, who do not love themselves, if they do evil,
that if you destroy, you make up.
You think you got it all original? It is a banality, my dear.
If you were schizophrenic, there would be an interest.
Do me a favor to get out of here!
Falling out of here!
Disappear once and for all!
The silence. The silence, the death, is just great.
Are you not ashamed?
In your place I gave a shot to the head.
You are a cagalhão. A beautiful and thick cagalhão.
I believe that is the end.
We hit the bottom.
The Victor took 2 years to sign
the divorce papers.
it was Not easy.
I Decided to dissolve the National Assembly.
I Married Marc, a man very sympathetic
who enriched it with new technologies.
I went back to study.
After that, I did a program for digital books.
Something kind of doubtful, but that kept me busy,
and without wanting to, I gained a lot of money.
In fact, maybe that was why Chloe decided to move in with us.
Parent. - Yes, my dear?
Sorry to bother. Would have been 20 euros for the taxi?
Is that the children are tired.
Take what you need in the drawer of the dresser.
Thank you, mother. I turn on later.
Poor thing. Eight years studying
and spends his life looking for a job.
This is what progress is.
- And your son? - Arthur?
Want to know the truth? I got rid of it.
Not. I've never done badly to him.
On the contrary, if you want to know.
He was the one who went away
to live with a woman weird
- 61 years of age. - a 61-year?
The tastes and the colors, you know how it is.
And Victor?
Disappeared for 2 or 3 years.
we Knew that he was living in Brittany,
in a house near a lake with many cats.
Thank you, my dear, very kind. My love.
Chloé visited him once or twice a month.
it Was there that he wrote his famous best-seller.
"Until the Goncourt Award, my father always
I considered a genetic error."
Listen, Victor, I like you very much...
But it is not with this that cast a family.
"For him the word 'artist' was thinking of pederasty,
and 'pederasty", in the final form of the degeneration."
"Sometimes, I lived my life to write it, adopt it,
without living it fully."
"The childhood of my daughter, for example,
it was draft 2 books without interest.
Should have landed on the pen and enjoy the life free."
- Yes, but I can't go. - "Sarah."
- "Sarah." - asked Me to stay with him.
"I heard the criticism of her.
not Yet looked at it, the one ray of tenderness
I fell out of the sky."
it Is quite disturbing to read your own life.
I can't explain the effect it caused me.
"We consider ourselves to be so sexy
when we are in love.
We are led to believe
that our desires are infectious."
"How she must have suffered
with my clumsiness triumphant."
"Thinking to satisfy her, I just couldn't force her."
"I would give all of my books for one of her smiles."
- Stop, Victor, stop. Not. - it Is good.
"The laughter of Sarah was my only religion."
"No offense to some, we find sometimes
love is irreversible."
"The END"
Is the return of Victor Adelman.
You know that is not my writer of choice.
The last book it was of the worst books that I have read.
But "The Time Of Smiles' was a surprise!
I did not expect. It is a pity not to be able to speak with him.
It does not promote itself more.
first of all is the autopsy cruel, bitter,
a marriage is painful.
All over the world bought this book
that had my life.
My second husband has also made it a beast with seven heads.
One day, Chloe told me
that afternoon the father would come to pick her up.
CHAPTER 12 THE CONTRACT
3 October 2000
Sit down, please.
Chloe said that it will arrive late.
Ah, good?
I am sorry, coffee is not my forte. Must be a little bitter.
- Not, is good. - he went to live in Paris?
Not. I came only a few days for a conference.
Chloé said to me that it is lovely where you live.
- Yes? - With the lake, the birds...
Yes, it is true that it is beautiful. It is even very beautiful.
Sorry, for a laugh, because...
If you knew the number of times I wished for his death.
It seems violent, but there's a recipe.
I imagined everything, I'm going to saying.
Strangulation, weapon, white, castration.
And in the end, you are a charming guy.
You too, Victor.
- it Is a large house, isn't it? - Yes, quite.
- what is to do in life, even? - I'm on the computer.
Yes, yes.
Is my Hi-Fi there? Not?
- it Is possible. - Yes, I recognize that.
Even CDs, it should be Chloe who brought them.
- I Can put a song? - Go ahead, please.
come Back to see you seek
I knew that was waiting for me.
I know...
It's going down a little bit, if you don't mind.
Of course. Can I borrow two seconds?
Thank you very much.
come Back to see you seek
It was not Sarah who has purchased this coffee table?
If I remember correctly she hated the glass tables.
Yes, but that was before.
She will go down.
Warning from now on, I will be so thrilled.
Maybe I shake it up. And I am able to vomit.
- Want a Lexomil? - No, thank you.
I'm trying to decrease the medications.
I took too much when... you stole from me Sarah.
Now I'm going with calm. Hello.
- Hello. - Victor Adelman.
I think that already we know.
Left Me for a guy who collects
turtles porcelain.
- Yes. - He was trying to disguise.
- it Is a passion? - does Not like turtles?
- But I felt shaken.
- More or less.
I offer you a. Please, select.
Don't say choice, but to take it back.
Frankly, it would be a shame. You write better
- when she is with me. - let's Say I sell more books.
- I do Not think that I write better. - I'm Not going to contradict him.
You are right here. Very well.
The neighborhood is nice. Here is enormous. You are beautiful.
In the evening, you should drink a glass of wine in this large sofa.
But you saved our sofa.
- Yes. - I Love this sofa. That pleased Me.
Has a air miserable in comparison to this one.
He seems intimidated. Don't let the tread on my old.
I am happy to return to see you.
Like this sofa?
Not too much, not.
Poor thing, he doesn't like you.
You are wrong, it is very comfortable.
I have many memories with him.
I can get each 2 or 3 days?
You are funny.
I don't know if I am. And you? You is funny?
He makes you laugh?
- Answer. - It does not make you laugh?
It does not make you laugh.
There is nothing more exciting than run away
with the man we love.
We?
Even always.
The bags ready and everything.
I already knew that I was going to pick back up.
I am the one who is taking back.
- Take here. - what is it?
A letter. Read.
"I, the undersigned, Victor Adelman of Richemont,
swear never to scold my wife
having been to another man for five and a half years."
"Never ask her
with whom he had more pleasure in a bed."
"Not interrogate her against her will
and consult a psychiatrist at least twice a week
to be able to comply with this contract."
And now, sign.
I Bought this house with the money from the divorce.
Chloé went to Lyon to continue his studies useless.
Victor and I were finally alone.
It me scarlett
as if you were to meet us.
He was charming, elegant and confident.
Everything was pure happiness.
Until our son was left by his companion.
He came to live with us.
Not going to eat?
Yes, my dear.
there Was in that child an excess of poetry.
He has not improved much.
No, not enough.
As least expected, he was delayed in everything,
died very early.
We think of the deep sorrow that they feel Sarah and Victor.
What will be the life of them? Life without Arthur?
Don't cry, sweetheart. Don't cry.
I'm crying for not being sad.
I know. But don't cry. It's not your fault.
- It was not very captivating. - Not.
It was silly.
Yes, my love.
- He was bad. - Very bad.
My husband has published "The Child That I did Not love."
Despite the scandal caused by the book,
he entered to the French Academy.
it Was covered with praise.
Were the best years of our lives.
I loved that decade.
Until they accept a drug of the job of a teacher.
From there, the jealousy has moved to the side.
October, 2003.
Letter to his brother Mikhail about the "Crime and Punishment".
"I put my heart and my blood in this novel...
it Is true that he has lost the charm of its 30 years,
but we must not underestimate the power of the erotic
that is given by knowledge and by awareness.
This pervert of Fyodor Dostoevsky
could you give us complex forever.
The first was Julie,
after Moïra, Ingrid,
Anaïs,
and finally Mélanie.
- If you have the time. - Yes, I have...
You are beautiful.
CHAPTER 13 MÉLANIE
He introduced me as his pupil.
The future Françoise Sagan.
Invited her on the weekends and after our vacation.
Poor thing, she had neither the 25 years
and I dreamed of seeing her die in agony.
So, what do you think?
Want my opinion about a teacher
who falls in love with one of his students.
- so what? - Is me cumming?
Want me to believe that it is fiction
because the guy is a redhead and the girl is asian?
- But, my love. - Still on top,
want my opinion. Here it goes.
This book is a shit.
In the story of being attracted by the hair,
no one will believe you.
My poor Victor.
And the scene of the wedding at the end
it is one of the most stupid things that you've written.
Why do you say that?
Because, my dear, is a bitch who wanders the rear
in the literary world.
It is not by chance that she always refuses
go to bed with him.
She refuses because he is married.
Because she is sick of it! Inform yourself a little bit.
She has already been to bed with half of the men
Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
It is true?
Was sad. But you shouldn't, my dear.
I was not speaking of Mélanie and yes character.
You well know that is fiction this.
Want to see what you do with your fiction? Take a look at it.
- No, Sarah. - There it is.
What you see in her?
It me wonder. Have consideration for me.
It is enough for you to be admired by an idiot?
Accepts any type of appreciation. Really?
How far have we come...
Sorry, have not seen my phone by any chance?
Falls out! Falls out, immediately! Short!
Françoise Sagan, the fucking!
The output of Mélanie, plunged my husband into a serious depression.
He stopped giving classes. Stopped writing.
I Spent the day looking at the trees
as if only they could understand the gravity
of the frustrations sexual.
The years have passed so well cruel on the face of Victor.
I via age.
He fell in love with the television.
Notably by Michel Drucker,
that became literally our lover virtual.
And one morning, when you get to the shopping...
- Dear. - Yes?
As if called even my brother?
- Victor. - I don't Know, gave me a white.
- Say to me. - kidding?
- Not, say to me. - Was Antoine.
I initially thought that he did this to me to annoy.
CHAPTER 14 THE FALL
Our daughter, Chloe, after 36 years
a relationship that is almost incestuous with the father,
has finally decided to worship another male.
On the eve of her wedding, we did a dinner.
- Who is it? - Who?
She.
Victor, is your daughter.
This fat?
He began to lose the memory every day for a year
after you have stopped having sex.
I'm Not sure if there is a causal link.
Victor. Victor, look at me.
Victor, what is this?
- A glass.
- And this what is it?
A brush.
Not. This is a thermometer.
And I, who am I?
I am your wife, Victor.
Not.
And why not?
Because you are too old.
That's cool.
So, who is your woman?
Is Mélanie.
My poor Victor. Never recovered the judgment.
I Remember one night, when he looked at me
with the eyes of a child.
Mother, mother?
The "mother"?
I'm sorry, mother.
With whom you are talking to, Victor?
Forgive Me for everything that I wrote.
There were so many other things to say.
I could have written about my childhood,
the birthday parties that you organized.
On your smile.
On the sweetness of your look.
I could have written about your decency
and his mood strange.
I ask forgiveness, mother.
From the bottom of my heart, I pray that I'm sorry.
I forgive you, my son. I forgive you.
Thank you, mother.
For his birthday, I took him to Étretat.
it Was there that we spent our first holiday,
45 years ago.
Not feeling well? Want to go back?
- I love you. - what?
- I love you. - Oh, is it?
Of course, that I love thee.
- But who am I? - are You my woman.
- it Was silly or what? - But who is his wife?
It Is Sarah.
It is my happiness.
I made you walk with a blindfold.
You thought free. Remember that?
Yes, and you remember that?
Of course, I remember everything.
Wait.
Me sells this. I want to do it again.
- are you sure? - Yes, please.
- Not. - Will.
- we'll hurt you. - Not, I trust in you.
- Want? - Yes.
- Is hurting? - Not.
Come with me, little bugger.
- Take care, right? - Yes, trust me.
Ande.
Trust me, Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah. Sarah...
Already we arrived, my princess. You can take the scarf.
- As it is beautiful. - Yes, it is beautiful.
- I love You. - I also.
How good it is to come back to find you.
Why is the lady crying?
- what? - The lady is sad.
We know of?
Walk, let's go.
Take, my Victor. Put this.
- Why? - to Do this, cover the eyes.
Do not be afraid, I'm here.
Keep to the left.
Now, always in front of you, Victor.
This is the same.
Always forward, dear, I'm right here.
In these troubled times
for the intolerance and the barbarism,
We cried for a poet.
In fact, is a writer of immense that just left us.
Let us remember his masterpieces.
I console myself saying that he has not suffered much.
He fell to 152 meters in height. This age is a feat.
Was not there when he fell?
Not.
I was cold, I went back to the hotel.
He wanted to stay and contemplate the landscape.
Right.
That's what I said to the police when I was interrogated.
- And you, what do you think? - I?
Yes. You.
I think that the lady loved him
and perhaps it was time for him to leave.
Both for him and for the lady.
Very well...
It is already late afternoon. But I think I have said everything.
- thank you Very much. - I is that I thank you.
They were all gone.
You saved me from that bunch of broken old.
And thanks to you, I had the impression to be with him.
EPILOGUE
To re-read the books of Victor, I noticed a marked difference,
in the form and in the context, among the books that he wrote
when you were together and that he wrote
when they were separated.
Where you want to go, my young woman?"
I don't know how to say...
Never helped him write some of the books?
- what is this? - it Is a suggestion.
- it Is only a suggestion. - You changed everything.
Have not changed anything, only I changed some sections.
Yes, but this way I'm turning jewish.
And then, you told me that if I felt jewish.
The heck with the Goncourt. It is just a shit.
"Victor Adelman"?
Is the last name of my father. Found it strange?
Are you comparing it to Philip Roth
and to the great writers of american jews.
The Goncourt award was awarded to Sarah Adelman
by the work The Village Uncomfortable.
Just wrote the first 30 pages.
I am as well?
I chose the only woman who is not impressed
with what I'm doing! Shit!
You're not well?
- Not. - Look in the drawer on the left,
at the bottom of the invoices.
It is only a draft with 30 pages,
but I think that you will like. Any way is your style.
And comes from what?
- Takes. - what is it?
You forgot on the kitchen table.
I have read it. Is formidable.
"The Mills Of Silence."
- I Wrote this?
- of Course, my love.
There are months that you are working at it.
It seems that you will piss in the pants.
Yes.
Not going to write anything about what you just said.
If you say anything, I'll deny everything.
Later, I will tell you is a shit, a charlatan.
Why not tell the truth?
Because it is my right.
Today, people only think of fame,
on the idea that others make of them.
There is no more secrets.
And I love secrets.
Readers have a right to know.
Readers... we have not slept with them.
I have already had a player.
He was the man I loved.
I had everything I wanted.
I assure you, with humor and some imagination
what goes on between two people,
can be worth more than all the merits.
Make a good trip.
Sorry, but that counted for me?
By the pleasure of seeing the guy that is doing.
It looks like a small beaver.
Never thought of doing implants of hair?
Not.
It is a bit expensive, but worth it.
- Good night. - Good night.
