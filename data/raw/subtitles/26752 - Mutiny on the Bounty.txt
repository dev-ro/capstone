Eight o'clock.
All's well. Misty weather.
-Here ye are, me lad.
-Thank ye.
A press gang. A press gang!
The press gang!
Let's get out of here!
In the king's name!
Well, we got alI the fish
we need in one net.
-Line them up, boatswain.
-Aye, aye. Line up, lads!
Lads, bow your necks and weep.
You're in the king's navy.
I'm no seaman, sir. I'm a taiIor.
What's that, your needlework?
No chin music.
-What ship?
-The Bounty, for the South Seas.
-The South Seas?
-That's the end of the world.
No, he saiIed there with Captain Cook.
He knows the brown gals
gay as kiss-me.
-Who's the captain?
-Bligh.
-Bligh!
-Seize him!
How long will we be gone?
Till there's enough frost in hell
to kill snap beans.
How long is that, sir?
I've got to know.
-Two years, lad.
-Please, don't take my husband.
When we had a baby,
Tommy left the sea.
He don't want to serve in the navy.
-It's true, sir.
-Sorry, the king needs six men.
You can't take him! It's like forever!
I can't take them and not take him.
No, you can't take him!
I won't let you!
-Lass, lass.
-It's two years! No! It's two years!
This is England's new venture
in science, in trade, in discovery.
Who else but Sir Austin Byam's son
should go?
But two years.
-I understand, my dear.
Ship ahoy!
Bob.
Behold! The elder son of the sea
and heir to all its oceans.
Uniform by Jeeves.
It's so new, it creaks.
I'll come back an admiraI,
with a necklace for you.
Pearls as big as coconuts.
I'll name a nice shiny island
after you, Sir Joseph.
-I owe you for my appointment.
-You've been appointed for one purpose:
To make me a dictionary
of the Tahitian language.
I've made that cIear to Captain Bligh.
-What's he like, sir?
-Captain Bligh?
He's a seagoing disaster.
His hair is rope yarn.
His teeth are marlinespikes.
Marlinespikes? Good.
Sounds rather terrifying.
But perhaps, as your father used to say:
"A taut hand at sea is better
than a sIack one."
You'd have made a rare sailor, ma'am.
Why don't you stow away, Mother?
I've considered it. Very seriously.
Well, here's to the voyage
of the Bounty.
To the voyage of the Bounty!
Still waters and the great golden sea.
Flying fish Iike streaks of silver
and mermaids that sing in the night.
The Southern Cross, and all the stars
on the other side of the world.
Bless my souI.
To the voyage of the Bounty!
Is that the Bounty?
No, sir. That's the flagship of the fleet.
There's your little pint-pot.
That's the Bounty for Tahiti?
She isn't very big, is she?
It ain't the size that counts, youngster.
It's the salt in the lads that man it.
-Where's your sweetheart?
-She married a sailor.
Oh.
It's ElIison, sir.
He tried to break ship.
-On deck, Morrison.
-Aye, sir.
-Churchill.
-Aye, sir.
Break ship, would you?
I can't face it, sir. Not two years.
I might not come back.
Then she's left with the baby.
Flog me, send me to jail,
but don't take me, sir!
Don't.
Now, listen to me, ElIison.
The sea's hard, but you whistle it off.
Do your spit and polish
and you'lI come home with the seals...
...following in admiration.
I was like you when I first came to sea,
Cumberland moss all over me.
Now it's turned to barnacIes.
That's better.
On this voyage, if you get in trouble,
come to me. I'll see you get justice.
But if you're wrong,
look out for squalls.
Now, get your chin up.
Go on deck. Say goodbye to your wife.
-You've got her aboard, sir?
-And the baby.
-Come on. Shake a leg.
-Thank you, sir.
-So you're going to the South Seas?
-Aye.
Here. Take this with you.
You can buy your own island.
Ten shiIlings.
Ten? l ain't seen the king's face
on a shilling for so long...
...l've forgotten which George it is, but
I'll take it and pay you when I get back.
SaiIor! You're not coming back,
not in this little half-walnut.
Here you are. Diamond brooch.
Real goId, mister,
owned by Captain Kidd.
With a map of the treasure
under the works.
Here. Stand clear with the tinware, Joe.
You keep leeward
of the ship's gentlemen.
All right, now. Ta-ta. Ta-ta!
Mr. Byam? I'm Fletcher Christian,
lieutenant and master's mate.
-You'Il be my instructor.
-Yes, in navigation and trigonometry.
You'll have a watch, keep order,
go aloft to mend canvas, reef and furl.
Otherwise, your time is your own.
Mr. Christian, in my hands,
the ship is safe.
I understand.
"A little child shall lead them."
Come along, I'll show you beIow. You
there, take Mr. Byam's box to his berth.
-Ahoy, Mr. Christian!
Ahoy!
Excuse me.
Good morning, sir.
Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
Think l've got enough
for a two years' voyage?
You know your draft better than I do.
My Iad, nobody can estimate my draft,
least of all myself.
-Easy, easy.
-What makes her rolI so?
Here's a navy for you.
Rum in the skimmers today
and bIood in the scuppers tomorrow.
This is our ship's surgeon.
We call him Mr. Bacchus.
-He's never told us his real name.
-I've forgotten it.
Pleased to meet you.
Mr. Byam, I should never
have gone ashore.
England's only an island,
and aIl islands are alike.
I'm going below. Bear a hand.
Easy, now. Easy.
Oh, Tommy, I'm afeard.
This ship's unlucky.
They've changed the name.
Well, I changed your name, didn't I?
Was that unlucky?
Oh, Tommy.
One, two.... Three of us in here?
My dog at home has a bigger kennel
all to himself.
I can see we shalI be as friendly
as tomcats in a sack.
Mr. Stewart? Mr. Byam.
Drop in anytime, Byam.
I'll be just 10 inches away from you.
-A pleasure, Mr. Stewart.
-I hope you'll Iike the ship.
-I'd Iike any ship, Mr. Stewart.
-Johnny Newcomer.
Oh, yes, Mr. Byam,
the amiable Mr. Hayward.
-How do you do?
-Mr. Hayward has been two years at sea.
And a man who's been two years at sea
should know how to lash his hammock.
Yours looks like
a Frenchman's knapsack.
All right. On deck, all of you.
Mr. Maggs?
This here Captain Bligh, sir.
Now, you being ship's clerk...
...would you call him a gentle officer?
If l was you, I wouldn't be
calIing him anything.
Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Maggs, no.
Never calI anybody anything.
But l do hope he is gentle because
I'm his messman and I frighten so easy.
It runs in our family, Mr. Maggs.
My mother was frightened by
my father before I was born...
...and I've been frightened ever since.
Do you know there's times when
I can hardly hold a glass in my hand?
-Silence. The captain's coming aboard.
-Oh, oh.
Company, atten!
Mr. Christian, clear the decks
of this rabble.
Very good, sir. Clear decks.
Everybody ashore. Clear decks.
-Mr. Fryer, we sail at six bells.
-Sail at six beIls.
-We got our rights here.
-Off ship, Joe. Off ship.
I'm not going until the ship sails.
Hey, you can't do that!
Flogging through the fleet.
We're included.
-A compliment to the Bounty, Sir Joseph.
-Yes.
Mr. Christian, pipe the ship's company
at five bells to witness punishment.
Would you care to see the flogging?
No. The only discipIine
I know is science.
There's science in using a
cat-o'-nine-tails. Watch my boatswain.
I really must be off.
I came aboard merely to introduce Roger.
Goodbye, my boy.
This won't be all cakes and ale, Roger...
...but your family's followed the sea
for seven generations.
Not one ever failed in his duty.
In a tight place,
that's all you'll need to remember.
-I'lI try to, sir.
-Sure you will, my boy.
-Goodbye, Mr. Bligh.
-Goodbye, Sir Joseph.
What does it mean, sir,
"flogging through the fleet"?
Sentence of court-martiaI,
two dozen lashes at each ship.
What was the man's crime, sir?
Struck his captain.
But that's over 300 lashes.
I don't understand why--
Can you understand this?
Discipline's the thing.
A seaman's a seaman, captain's
a captain. And a midshipman...
...is the Iowest form of animal life
in the British navy.
Now you know what a midshipman is.
Line up!
Port oars!
Ship's company, off hats!
Article 22: "If any officer, mariner
or other person in the fleet...
...shall strike or offer to strike
any of his superiors...
...and being convicted,
he shall suffer punishment...
...inflicted on him by
the sentence of a court-martial."
Ship's company, on hats!
-Mr. Morrison, two dozen, l believe.
-Two dozen it is, sir.
-The man is dead, sir.
-Dead?
-Shall I dismiss the men, sir?
-What?
Certainly not.
We'll proceed with punishment.
Boatswain, do your duty.
Come along with you. Do your duty!
Bloody murderer.
Mr. Byam!
Punishment counted out, sir.
-Mr. Morrison, come aboard.
-Mr. Fryer, make ready to sail.
-Starboard watch, secure for sea.
Starboard watch, shorten and cable!
Stand by to go aloft!
In captain's gig, Mr. Christian.
Both watches, hoist!
Hoist away!
-Topsails.
Way aloft!
Winds offshore!
You'll take the mizzenmast, Mr. Byam.
What's the matter, afraid to go aIoft?
Why, it's child's play.
That man they flogged.
He was dead.
Get aloft. Bear a hand.
Mr. Morrison, start those men.
Tallyho!
Child's play.
Anchors aweigh, sir.
Let fall!
Down from aloft!
Down from there! A dozen for
the coat of the last man down!
Please, sir!
Skipper Hayward!
Mr. Hayward!
-I'lI take care of him.
-Keep hoId!
Hoist away!
Set courses, royals and gallants!
Royals and gallants!
Starboard bridges,
aweigh with the anchors.
-Ship ready.
-Give her lee helm.
Lee helm, sir.
-Steady.
-Steady, sir.
There she goes. Her anchor's up.
Oh, Mary, it's such a littIe ship.
My Tommy wiIl bring her home.
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
-We're under canvas again, Mr. Christian.
-Yes, sir.
-It's our third voyage together.
-Not of my choosing.
So the port admiral told me.
Well, you're here. I requested you.
I like having a gentleman as my
subordinate, being a self-made man.
I admire you for that, sir.
And for very little else?
SaiIing orders?
Tahiti direct by Cape Horn.
Winds permitting.
If we can't make westing,
we shall have to go by Africa.
Then we'll have to get
supplies at Simon's Bay.
We'll need them. This ship has
less food than a prison hull.
And I don't trust that clerk of yours.
Who asked you to meddle
with my clerk?
Can't get much from a hungry man.
I have to work these men we feed.
Rascals and pirates.
Did you see them growl at the flogging?
I'll teach them what flogging's like.
My advice, sir, if you'll take it,
is not to be too harsh with them.
We're sailing 10,000 miles together
for the next two years.
-It's like a powder magazine.
-I don't want your advice.
I've my own way with seamen.
They respect one law, the law of fear.
-My officers should remember that.
-I can only tell you what I think!
They come from jails and taverns, but
they're English and they'll sail anywhere.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I expect you to carry out whatever
orders I give, whenever l give them.
I'll carry out your orders, Mr. Bligh.
Then we understand each other?
Perfectly.
-Any orders for the deck?
-No.
-That all?
-Yes. You may go.
Thank you, sir.
-She's flying, Mr. Christian.
-Tahiti direct, sir.
Tahiti direct, Mr. Christian.
Pass it on: No change of
saiI without my orders.
Put two men at the wheel.
-We'Il carry on or carry under.
-Very good, sir.
-Southeast by east.
-Southeast by east, sir.
No change in sails...
-...except for captain's orders.
-Good.
Mr. Byam, you'Il stand by
for midshipman's school.
Aye, aye, sir.
You! HoId up, there!
Never empty your buckets into the wind!
Find the wind, you idiot!
Find the wind and then choose your rail.
Get below!
We're off around the world, boys.
Light hearts and tight britches.
Off around the world.
Oh, dry up, you cub.
Is it human, or what do you think?
I can't stand yowling water babies.
Blast you! I told you not
to swing that lantern!
You don't mean it makes you seasick?
An oId buccaneer like you? La-di-da.
I'll knock more tar out of you
than it'll take a month to mix.
-Come on, blowhard.
-Oh, stow it, wilI you?
I can't make head or tail
of this navigation.
Don't worry. lf you get tangled,
I'll jump in and pull you out.
You'd better not try and fooI
Mr. Christian.
Mr. Christian holds no terrors for me.
I can wade the seven seas
and never wet my shirt.
They have whales that can sink a ship,
but I can sink the whale.
Behold, the face that launched
a thousand ships.
Gentlemen.
Today's navigating probIem:
Given the aItitude of Polaris, could you
find your latitude, Mr. Stewart?
To lead up to it...
...ordinarily, the shortest distance
between two points is a straight line.
Uh, but this is not true of navigation.
We must consider winds and currents--
Yes. Suppose you considered
the problem.
Yes, sir.
-Perhaps Mr. Stewart means that it's...
...like that Iantern, sir.
We assume it should hang straight
down, but because the ship is rolling...
...it swings to and fro.
But by watching it closely--
You disagree with Byam, Mr. Hayward?
He knows the lantern makes me seasick.
He's doing it to break up the lesson.
-Stewart doesn't know his problem.
-StilI, his original theory interests me.
Please, sir.
Proceed, Mr. Byam. You were saying,
by watching the lantern closely--
What seems to be the trouble,
Mr. Stewart?
Watch the wind, Mr. Stewart.
It's not there. It's there.
Is that the face that launched
a thousand ships?
One navigation problem
and three wrecks.
Smart as paint, you are.
Why, you ungratefuI swab.
After l've given my aIl
for the honor of the class.
Byam!
It wasn't my fault.
He came behind and struck me.
-Is that true, Mr. Byam?
-I'd rather not say, sir.
So you want to fight?
I'll cool you off.
Get to the masthead and stay there
until I call you down.
AlI the way, sir?
-All the way.
-Get below or go aloft!
-Yes, sir!
Rather heavy weather
to send him aloft, isn't it?
They must learn this isn't a beer garden.
If you don't teach them, I will!
Look alive, you crawling caterpillar!
-Where's Byam?
-I couldn't help it, Stewart.
When the man looks at me,
I want to jump overboard.
Where's Byam?
-The old man sent him aloft.
-You let him take the blame, huh?
Here, here!
You've started enough trouble!
Time you learn discipline!
Get into your hammock...
-...before I put you over a gun!
-Yes, sir.
Get up!
You see, sir? It isn't my fault.
They're only jealous because
I've been at sea before.
Who did that?
I did, sir.
Come here.
Good.
How she creaks. Wind's a gale.
I'm too oId to envy young Byam aloft.
-Splice the main-brace, Mr. Morgan.
-I'lI take it to kiIl germs.
What? Waste my brandy?
Here, you use the ship's drinking water.
It would shrivel me wooden leg.
Did you ever hear how I lost my leg?
-No, no, but we will.
-Well--
-I'm worried about Byam.
-Oh, he'll weather it all right.
Well, I left my leg with
John PauI Jones back in '78.
We came astern with a Yankee.
Up went our colors and our captain hails,
"What ship is that?"
"American ship Ranger," roars Jones,
and up go his colors.
"Louder, you Yankee pip-squeak,"
our captain yells.
"I can't hear you!"
"Can you hear this?" says Jones,
and he lets go a broadside.
Thundering guns.
You all right?
-Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
-Look after him, Mr. Morgan.
Keep her head up!
Starboard!
Get him below, to the surgeon!
Mr. Christian!
-Who brought that man down?
-I did, sir!
But l sent him aloft!
He's gone under. The top's no place.
I know his place. Time you knew yours.
Maintain discipline, not break it!
Send him aloft again!
Mr. Bligh, he's had enough!
Send him aloft again!
That's right, lad. Drink another.
You'll be as right as a truism.
If you'd Iost a leg, now....
I lost mine in action against
the French, off Jamaica.
A French surgeon did the trick for me.
He apologized in French,
and l cursed him in English.
-How is he?
-I'm all right, sir.
He'lI go anywhere.
Get to the masthead again, Byam.
-I've taken my punishment, sir.
-Get to the masthead!
I've had a bellyful of that masthead
from Captain Bligh!
-You can't make me go back again!
-Byam.
It was Mr. Christian
brought you down, lad.
Thank you, sir.
I didn't understand. Captain's orders.
-You mind?
-No. Let him have it.
Here, you'lI need this.
Here's something else you'Il need.
You're a plucky youngster.
If necessary, I'd be happy
to cut off your leg anytime.
Thank you, sir.
-If anything happens to that lad, Bligh--
-Christian!
Christian, careful!
Ship's company, off hats.
O eternaI God, who alone
spreadest out the heavens...
...and rulest the raging sea, who has
compassed the waters with bounds...
...untiI night and day come to an end...
...receive into thy almighty
and most gracious protection...
...the persons of us, thy servants
and the fleet in which we serve.
Preserve us from the dangers of the sea
that we may be a safeguard...
...unto our gracious lord
King George and his kingdoms...
...and a security for such as pass on
the seas upon their lawful occasions...
...and that we may return in safety
to enjoy the blessings of the land...
...with a remembrance of thy mercies
to praise and gIorify thy holy name...
...through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.
Amen.
-Ship's company, on hats.
The ship's company
will bear in mind...
...we are at sea
under the articles of war.
Perhaps you are unaware
that the articIes of war invest in me...
...the authority to order punishment.
During the recent heavy weather,
I've watched you at work on deck and aloft.
You don't know wood from canvas,
and it seems that you don't want to learn.
Well, I'lI have to give you a lesson.
You, you, you, step forward.
You three are a disgrace to saltwater!
Ten days on half rations.
What's your name?
-Thomas Burkitt, sir.
-He's a thief, sir. Dartmoor Prison.
-A thief.
-Convicted. Offered a choice:
Dartmoor Prison or the king's navy.
You've been to Dartmoor Prison, Burkitt?
-Yes, sir.
-It seems you prefer the navy.
You may regret that choice
before this voyage is over. Your name?
Thomas Ellison, sir. Pressed into service.
I've got a wife, a baby.
I asked your name, not the history
of your misfortunes. Your name?
-Smith.
-Not you, you idiot! You.
-William Muspratt, sir.
-Have you got a wife, Muspratt?
Have you got a wife?
Two, sir.
The ship's company will remember that
I am your captain, judge and your jury.
You do your duty
and we may get along...
...but whatever happens,
you'll do your duty. Go forward.
Lively, lads.
Thief. Nobody calls me a thief
but the men I steals from.
Half rations.
You there!
Who did that?
I can't tell you, sir.
-Mr. Morrison.
-Aye, sir.
-Report that man for two dozen lashes.
-But....
I done it, sir.
Pick it up.
Put it back.
-Mr. Morrison, Iay on with a will.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Bligh, these men aren't
king-and-country volunteers.
They've been brought aboard
by press gangs.
In a week, l'll get some spirit
without flogging.
Teach them who's master
and never let them forget.
-Mr. Morrison!
Aye.
Before we see port, I'll make them
jump at a midshipman's jacket...
...even if it's hung
on a broomstick to dry.
Give this man his two dozen. When I ask
for information, l expect to get it.
-I didn't hear the watch call, sir.
-Why not?
Sorry, I was cleaning brass
for Mr. Byam.
That's true, sir.
Stretch this man over a gun
and give him two dozen lashes.
But l was responsible, sir.
Byam will be in charge
of the punishment.
Two dozen.
That's enough, Mr. Morrison.
Man overboard!
-Bring a line!
Idiot. I'll have to teach my top men
not to fall off the ship.
Mr. Morrison!
When you get him onboard,
stretch him with a rail to dry him off.
I can't stand it. l got to get water.
Get back to your work.
I wanted water for my knees, sir.
I can't stand it. Please, sir.
-What is it?
-This man left his work. Wants water.
Look, sir, it's the sand
worked in cruel.
-I wanted water to wash it.
-I'lI give you water.
Mr. Morrison, keelhaul this man.
Haul away!
-Well?
-The man is dead, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Bligh, I've seen calms and doldrums,
but not one like this in 40 years.
-The men in the boats are worn-out.
-Not the way they're pulling.
-Put new men into the boats.
-Mr. Morrison, pipe the men.
Change the boat crews.
Dive in with your mess, lads.
The boats are alongside.
Mr. Byam, look at this bit
of meat, sir. It's alive.
I'm sorry, lad.
There's nothing I can do about it.
This bit of meat was
mined in a rock quarry.
-Here, I'll change with you, lad.
-Thanks.
It's alive, all right...
...but they're fresh meat anyway.
Mr. Byam, I'm reporting
these two men unfit for duty.
-Very good. You men are relieved.
What's the delay here?
You realize we're waiting
for these men to puIl us into a wind?
The men haven't finished mess,
and these two are unfit for duty.
-Unfit?!
-My orders, sir.
If they can waIk, they can work.
Put them in the boats and get
these other men out immediately.
Any sign of a breeze, sir?
I'm about at the end of my rope.
Keep up your stroke, man.
I'll whistle a wind up for you.
Can't we...?
-Can't we rest a spell, sir?
-No, and keep your hatch closed.
This is the cask with
only one cheese in, sir.
-What's this? What's this?
-Two cheeses are gone.
-What?
-Two 50-pound cheeses missing.
-Stolen, of course, sir.
-Thieves and jailbirds!
-What?
-A hundred pounds of cheese gone.
They'd steal canvas off a corpse.
-Strange. l checked the stores myself.
-Cheeses can't fly, fool!
They've been stolen, of course.
Stop alIowance of cheese
until the theft is made up.
-Yes, sir.
-Pardon, sir. Back in Portsmouth...
...that cask was opened by you...
...and Mr. Maggs had the cheeses
carried ashore.
-Silence!
-Perhaps you'll recollect, sir.
-Maggs had me take them to your house.
-You insolent scoundrel!
But I remember very well, sir.
I didn't get to see my wife that day.
Boatswain, spread-eagIe that liar
to the rigging tiIl sundown.
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Wind off the starboard bow, sir.
-Man the lee board braces!
Aye, aye, sir.
Here. Get that.
Well, Mr. Christian, if your rascals
are any good, bring us into the wind.
Boats!
-Pull, lads! PuIl!
-Lay into it, now. Get up.
Send her up, Burkitt. PuIl!
Mr. Byam, pull up their strokes!
PulI! Pull!
-Mr. Hayward, speed up!
-Mr. Byam, use your rope's end!
Come on, lads, pull!
-Come on, pick them up.
PulI!
We're almost in! Put your weight in it!
Good lad, Muspratt. Pull, lads!
We're in!
-We're in!
WeIl done, there!
Shall I call the boats in, sir?
They've done their job.
What do you expect me to do,
knight them? Hoist the boats.
-Aye, sir.
-Good, lads! Good, lads!
Well, we are out of
the doldrums at last, sir.
I toId you to spread-eagle that liar.
Why hasn't it been done?
Very good, sir.
Come along, McCoy.
There's nothing more powerful
than brandy.
I threw a brandy bottle overboard once,
empty one, off the coast of Madagascar.
Three years later, I picked it up
in a river in Portugal.
It had gone back
to its home vineyard for more.
You would've made
an excellent historian.
You have a profound contempt for facts.
I don't despise facts, sir,
I'm indifferent to them.
Water. Water.
Cheese, Mr. Christian?
No, thank you, sir.
-Mr. Byam?
-No, thank you, sir.
-Mr. Fryer?
-No, thank you, sir.
Perhaps the surgeon
wants cheese.
No, thank you, sir.
It's bad for my innards.
To the best of my recollection,
Mr. Christian, you're partial to cheese.
Not tonight, sir.
Burn me. I believe you're with the men.
If you'lI aIlow me,
I think you've been unjust.
-Unjust?
A bit of cheese, more or less.
Unjust? In other words,
you say I'm the man who lied.
I didn't say that, sir.
-You implied it.
I've no doubt that Maggs disposed of
the cheeses without your knowledge...
...but l can't understand your treatment
of the man who obeyed orders.
Maggs is my clerk. It's not
for my men to question his orders.
Nor for you to question mine!
I want your apology.
I have nothing more to say, sir.
Then you can dine elsewhere
on what you can get!
-Mr. Bligh.
-Byam.
Gentlemen.
Come, he implied it, didn't he, Mr. Byam?
Well, I can also dispense
with your company!
Thank you, sir.
So you're all against me,
officers and men.
Won't eat cheese, eh?
Before I'm done with you,
I'll make you eat grass!
I'm so hungry, if my mother
would reach out to pet me...
...l'd have a bit of her hand.
There's fish there, all right,
but they're making jokes about the bait.
You see--
If l could prove what I suspect, I--
No, I wouldn't.
I'm so weak, I'm peaceful.
Muspratt, Burkitt,
look here, supper.
What?
Why--
Why, Mr. Christian, sir.
Take a look at this, sir.
Supper for six men.
Four pounds, they calls it.
If that weighs more than 2,
I'll eat the cat-o'-nine-tails.
-It ain't pig. lt's horse meat.
-We pulled our hearts out for this breeze.
-And what do we get? We starve.
-Well, little meat, no distemper.
Keep the wind in the saiIs
and out of your stomach.
If it's any comfort,
the officers are in the same boat.
Not Captain BIigh.
He's getting fat, the dirty, thieving--
Burkitt!
Any more of that,
and l'Il clap you in irons.
Yes, sir.
Buckoes. Buckoes.
Here's your supper.
-Thompson, get your hook and line.
-Right.
See him? He's a big one, eh?
-Here you are, Burkitt.
-Right.
Well, we've got to have bait.
Sharks ain't seamen. They expect to eat.
We've got to have bait.
-You want to risk this for a meal?
-Aye.
-I'm willing.
-Yeah.
If the hook don't kill him, that pork will.
Let it go.
There he goes. There he goes.
-Got him.
-On deck with him.
-Easy, now. Easy, now. Easy, now.
-HoId him.
You first, Burkitt. Choose for your mess.
-Thanks, mates.
-Yeah, fine catch you've got there.
You know I must have a sIice, eh?
-Shark eat shark?
-You forget yourself.
You give me a slice, a nice, Iarge one,
and l'Il say nothing.
Tell him, you slimy quill-pusher.
Take your slice!
At ease, lads. At ease.
Well, how's our shark-killer, huh?
He's cut to bits, sir.
He'lI be all right. What's a flogging?
A few blows and a few "ohs,"
and then you put on your shirt.
-Here.
-Thank you, sir.
Now, if you'd Iost a leg, my lad....
I left mine with a Spanish pirate
off the coast of Trinidad.
A buIlfighter did the trick for me.
He was so drunk he nearly
cut off the wrong Ieg.
Hey! Here.
You'll be all right.
A bit tattooed on the back perhaps,
but just the right style for Tahiti, eh?
-Hey, fiddler, give him a tune.
-Aye, sir.
-Good night, lads.
-Good night, sir.
Listen, Byam. You can flog
those feIlows, starve them...
-...but they'll bob up again with a fiddle.
-Music at sea...
...l never imagined
how beautiful it was.
Master-at-arms,
stop that infernal jamboree.
-It's worse than two cats on a fence.
Aye, aye, sir.
The old death's-head.
I've never known a better seaman,
but as a man, he's a snake.
He doesn't punish for discipIine.
He likes to see men crawl.
I'd like to push his poison
down his own throat.
You both have one thing in common,
the devil's own temper.
He can Iet his go...
...but whether l can keep mine bottled up
for the next two years is a question.
I believe you will.
Whatever happens,
I'll always be glad I've known you.
I'll remember that when you're an admiraI.
Good night, youngster.
Good night.
-More tea, sir?
-No, you get out.
Yes, sir.
-You sent for me, sir?
-Yes, I've got a job for you this morning.
-Sit down. Had your breakfast?
-Yes, thank you, sir.
I want you to sign the list
of all supplies issued on the voyage.
Certify and sign.
We shouId raise the island anytime now.
Not a bad voyage so far.
All hands accounted for.
Only six down with scurvy.
Five with scurvy, one with flogging.
Correct, there's your credit.
Five with scurvy, one with flogging.
We're still under canvas.
Mr. Bligh, I can't sign this book.
No such amounts have been issued.
You've signed daybooks with extra kegs
the ship never carried.
-I have, sir.
-And why not? We all do it.
We'd be fools if we didn't
on a lieutenant's pay.
I want to stow away enough
to keep me out of the gutter.
I understand, a captain's prerogative.
Ordinarily, l wouldn't mind.
Why is this case different?
The captains I've served with
didn't starve their men.
They didn't save money by buying up
the stinking meat.
They didn't buy yams
that would sicken a pig.
Silence!
They didn't calI their men thieves
and flog them in the bone.
-Impudent scoundrel! Sign that book!
-I refuse...
...and you have no authority.
I haven't?! I'll show you authority.
Lay all hands aft! All hands aft!
Very good, sir.
Company, attend!
Mr. Christian, step forward.
"If any officer or other person
in the fleet...
...shall disobey any lawful command...
...of any of his superior officers,
every such person...
...being convicted of such offense
shall suffer death...
...or other punishment
as shall be inflicted on him...
...by the sentence of a court-martial."
Mr. Christian, you will sign this book.
Mr. Bligh...
...the ship's company wiIl bear witness
that I sign in obedience to your orders.
But remember, sir, I shall demand
a court of inquiry in England.
You mutinous dog.
-Retract that, sir.
-I will repeat it. You're a mutinous dog.
-Mr. Christian.
-Land ho, sir!
Furl away!
There she waits, lads!
-What is it, Mr. Fryer?
-Tahiti, you fool.
Oh.
So you'lI face me
with a court of inquiry?
We're a Iong way from England
and what can happen on this ship...
...before we get there
may surprise even you.
Milk! It's milk!
Captain, they got cows
here that lays eggs. What a place.
Would you help me up, sir?
I'd like to see the island.
What for? All islands are alike.
That's a singularly stupid observation,
sir, and grossly unscientific.
Well, science is one thing
and experience is another.
-See one island, you've seen them all.
-Fiddlesticks.
Well, I'm to be first ashore.
Captain's orders, to begin my dictionary.
I'll get my trade goods.
We can go ashore together.
All right, then.
-I know that man.
-Who is he?
A friend of Captain Cook's
when I was sailing master.
Hitihiti, chief of the island,
priest of the temple. Pipe him aboard.
-Mr. Fryer, dress ship.
-Very good, sir. Dress ship!
Bligh.
-Bligh.
-Hitihiti.
-Bligh, you got fat.
-Oh, well, it is 10 years...
...since we sailed together
with Captain Cook.
-I beg your pardon?
-Where Captain Cook?
Uh, Captain Cook is dead.
-Morti?
-Yes, yes, morti.
-He was a good man.
-Oh, yes.
-Hail King George.
-King George?
Captain Cook say King George come
on next English ship.
His Majesty is extremely sorry
he couldn't come.
I beg your pardon?
My hat.
Captain Cook say if King George
don't come, he send hat.
Yes, yes, yes! Of course, the hat.
Mr. Maggs, go to my cabin
and bring me the hat--
-The cocked hat, you fool!
-Yes, sir.
The hat will be here in one moment.
So we shall require
1000 breadfruit plants.
-Breadfruit? Uru.
-Correct, uru. Uru.
-All we have for you.
-Thank you, thank you.
We shall have to stay here
for several months.
We shall have provision--
-They're welcome to anything.
-Don't be a fool.
-You'Il need those gifts to make friends.
-Him no need gift, my friend.
-Me Hitihiti, you my tayo.
-Tayo?
Chief makes you his friend.
-In my tongue, close friend.
You Iive home, my home.
Tayo. Friend, the finest word
in any Ianguage.
-It shaIl be the first in my dictionary.
The hat.
Yes, thank you.
With the compIiments of His Majesty
King George III of Great Britain.
-Byam, you come ashore with me.
-Sir?
Permission granted, mind you report...
-...onboard ship every night.
-Very good.
-Byam wiIl live with my family.
-Impossible.
-I can have no favorites aboard my ship.
-Bligh, you are chief on this ship...
...but l am chief on that island.
Byam will come with me, yes?
Perhaps that's best. Permission granted.
By the way, Mr. Morrison,
pipe the ship's company aft.
Aye, aye, sir. All hands aft.
Well, we're here. Tahiti at last.
England to Cape Horn,
Africa, New Zealand...
...Van Diemen's Land
and the great South Seas.
I've sailed the Bounty over 27,000 miles...
...and you think you've come
to an island paradise...
...a tropical grog shop
of feast and song and sleep.
Well, you're wrong!
You're here to labor.
You'll fill this ship with breadfruit trees.
You'll recondition her for sea.
Shore leave permitted
if and when I can spare you.
If you abuse it, you'lI answer to me.
Remember, your work is finished when
we drop anchor in Portsmouth Harbor.
Mr. Fryer will have charge
of work ashore.
Very good, sir.
Mr. Christian, you will remain onboard
in charge of reconditioning the ship.
Unfortunately, you wilI have no shore leave
while we're here at Tahiti.
That's all.
Hurry, hurry.
What a place.
Hey, when's dinner?
Your language is most un-EngIish.
It means exactIy what it says.
Here are three pages
on your words meaning "look."
-Plenty kind of Iook.
-That's the trouble.
There's one for the downcast eyes,
one for the sidelong glance...
...one that invites, one that consents.
A whole language of looks.
Byam, you think too much.
One day, you head go crack.
No, no, no, Tehani. I've toId you before.
I like my flowers in a bowl.
Now, scat. I'm busy.
What do you call that look, Byam?
The look of a charming girl
who will still be happy...
...when we EngIish invaders go home.
By the way,
what's your word for money?
Money? What is money?
All right, l'Il explain. Which would you
choose? The shilling or the nail?
Oh, no, Hitihiti. With one of these
you can buy 20 of these.
-Oh? Where?
-Well, in England.
You see, in England, you must have money
to live with to buy food.
In island of England, no fruit on tree?
-No fish in the sea?
-Oh, yes. Plenty.
No money, no food?
-That's right.
-I stay here.
Byam, ahoy!
Sounds like Christian.
-Well, it can't be.
-Maybe so.
Hitihiti, you got him leave!
Byam!
Fletcher!
Ahoy, Robinson Crusoe.
-Fletcher!
I'd given up on seeing you ashore
and Hitihiti never even winked.
When he came aboard wearing that hat,
even the articIes of war failed Mr. Bligh.
Christian. Christian. Lieutenant.
Thank you for speaking to the captain.
The sea is good, but the earth
is good also. Be at home.
It's good to be ashore again.
I've been as restless as....
Can you speak Tahitian yet?
Like a native.
Why, you little powder monkey!
If you cross my hawse again, l'Il
spank your little starboard, understand?
-Yes.
-Yes?
-Well, I didn't know you speak English.
-Yes.
-You must think me a perfect fool.
-Yes.
-Well, does she or doesn't she?
-Yes. She speak English. One word: yes.
Mr. Byam, your Tahitian dictionary.
Madam.
This is Hitihiti's granddaughter.
-What did she say?
-You must be a king in your country.
What?
If His Majesty couId see her...
...as I see her now, he'd forgive the error.
-Shall I telI her that?
-No, no. Just say thank you.
Byam...
...your friend is wise.
He looks, he understand.
You make word,
you understand nothing.
No work today. Go swim, aIl.
Come along, Fletcher. I'll show you
an island you'll never forget.
-You can't imagine what it's--
-Byam.
They'd like to come with us,
if you don't object.
-Object?
-I thought not.
Christian?
Aren't they amazing? I never knew
there were such people in the world.
They're simple and kind,
and yet, somehow, they're royal.
Hmm? What did you say?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
I was just thinking...
...what a contrast to the ship.
Tehani wants to race me. Come on!
-Oh.
-What's wrong?
He comes from the ship.
-Captain Bligh's orders.
-Bligh?
You're to report onboard immediately.
Oh, I am? Byam, I know his game!
He gives me leave and recalls it to devil me
into insubordination. I'll oblige him!
I'll have one day off that ship
if I swing for it! Tell him I refuse!
What did she say?
The man wiIl tell Captain Bligh
you can't be found.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
She says you were magnificent,
like a storm at sea.
-Thanks for your kindness.
-You will come again?
That rests with you and the captain.
-You will come again.
-Thank you.
Byam, it's been a day.
Goodbye, Maimiti.
-Goodbye, all.
-Goodbye, Fletcher.
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, Mr. Stewart.
Mr. Bligh wishes you to report to him
as soon as you come aboard, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Stewart.
-Reporting, sir.
-You reIieve my anxiety.
I was about to send an armed
shore party to look for you.
-I had your permission, sir.
-You're a fine figure of a king's officer.
If l could prove to that native you're a liar,
they'd arrest you! You'll regret this!
Before this voyage is over,
you'll know who's master here!
Mr. Bligh, I have in mind the dead seaman
you had flogged in Portsmouth.
He struck his captain.
You'd like me to strike you.
-Well, I won't do it.
-Very clever, Mr. Christian.
1000 plants, sir. The pick of the island!
Mr. Morgan, I shall commend
your industry to Sir Joseph Banks.
Thank you. There's one difficulty, sir,
a very grave one.
These growing plants require more water
than we can store aboard.
We can't let them die, sir.
We won't.
Mr. Morgan, I'll take these trees
to the West Indies...
...every tree in prime condition.
I shall cut the water allowance
for the entire ship's company.
Good morrow to you.
I'll drink your health in Portsmouth!
-Put your stuff there.
-It's mine, sir. It's a gift.
Captain's orders.
Put it down and go forward!
Shore leave in heaven, duty in hell again.
-What have you got there?
-Monday Wash, sir.
It's a pet, sir.
Her name's Monday Wash.
Mr. Maggs, take that Iaundry
for the captain's table.
But, sir! Oh!
Now get forward!
-Come along, there. Hurry!
-Did he hurt you?
No, but one day,
I'll take that cane away--
Look behind you.
Yes.
Aren't you coming aboard, Hitihiti?
I have said farewell to Bligh.
I have sent gift to King George.
-Then this is goodbye.
-Yes.
Byam, tayo.
-You have been happy here?
-Very happy, Hitihiti.
Byam, I have no son.
Stay here with me. Be my son.
I must return to England.
I shall never come back.
Byam...
-...you will think of us sometime.
-Hitihiti.
Roger! Will you come here, please?
-Look.
-Big as gooseberries!
Make her understand.
These are priceless, I can't take them.
She says they're for your mother.
Oh. Well, thank her, Roger.
And telI her when this voyage is over,
somehow, I'm coming back.
-I can't tell her that.
-I mean it, Roger.
But it's a dream, Fletcher.
This island isn't real for you and me.
It's the ship that's real.
It's taking us home.
Tell her, Roger.
Thank you, Roger.
Goodbye, Maimiti.
That's right. No tears, lass.
Love?
Love.
Goodbye.
Reporting with deserters. Taken on the
other side of the island. No resistance.
Very well, Mr. Young.
So you let them take you alive.
You'll regret that, me lads.
Take them below.
We ain't deserters, sir.
You kept us aboard because we
dropped that tub of breadfruit.
-We wanted to see the island--
-Take them below and put them in irons.
Prisoners in escort, into file.
Left, turn!
Quick march!
-Is she ready for sea, Mr. Fryer?
-Ready, sir.
-Set topsails and jibs.
-Stand by. Topsails and jibs.
All hands on deck!
Looking about me, I can't beIieve
we're in a ship of the royal navy.
The deck's like a barnyard!
Paradise is astern, gentlemen.
I'll break the men of that island
if I have to flog every thieving--
Which reminds me...
...10 coconuts, Crown property,
were stolen on your watch.
Correct, Mr. Maggs?
I counted myself.
-I'lI account for the men in my watch.
-They didn't take them.
-Can you account for yourself?
Mr. Bligh, may I recall
the outward voyage?
Harsh things were said, but I hoped
the return trip would be better.
Then suppose you
return the 10 coconuts.
-You think I'm so fond of them I'd steal?
-Yes, you hypocrite.
You stole Crown property
more vaIuable.
-Explain that!
-Pearls, Mr. Christian.
-Pearls?
I believe I said pearls.
Fortunately, Mr. Maggs was at the boat.
He saw that native woman
give you two pearls.
I think I'm beginning to understand.
The native woman, as you call her,
gave the pearls to me.
-They are not Crown property.
-The goods l gave away to the natives...
...belong to the Crown.
What comes back belongs to the Crown!
I'm not the most patient man
in the worId. Give them to me!
Remember, Mr. Bligh:
Crown property.
Very well, Mr. Christian.
Crown property.
-Gratings rigged.
-Everybody present?
-Everyone present, sir, but the surgeon.
-Huh?
The surgeon is ill, sir.
-Ill? Drunk, you mean!
-We had to bleed him this morning, sir.
He's not fit.
Mr. Morgan and Mr. Christian agree.
Go below.
Tell him to report on deck at once!
Very good, sir.
Thomas Burkitt, Matthew Thompson,
step forward.
Ship's company, off hats.
I'm sorry, sir.
Captain Bligh....
How do you feel?
I'm afraid I'm a very old man, lad...
-...and a very sick one.
-I'lI tell him again you can't report.
No, boy. No, I'm not worth
getting into a scrape over.
For once, a midshipman gives an order.
You stay where you are.
A good lad.
I must pulI him out.
I've taken the liberty of telling the surgeon
to stay. He's not able to report.
I'll have no drunken relic holding up
the discipline aboard my ship.
Once more, bring him on deck,
or l'Il have you seized up and flogged.
Byam doesn't wanna disobey you.
I beg you, don't force the old man.
He can't walk.
-Go below and see for yourseIf.
-Are you presuming to give me orders?
Reporting on deck for duty, sir.
Mr. Morrison, do your duty.
Four dozen, l believe.
Four dozen it is, sir.
Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
-Well?
-What did you expect, Mr. Bligh?
The man's dead.
I call this ship's company
to bear witness.
-You killed him!
-Silence.
Ship's company dismissed.
Boatswain, punishment postponed
24 hours.
Aye, aye, sir.
Do you hear, men?
Ship's company dismissed!
Bear a hand. Take him below.
Drunkard?
Yes, but everybody loved him.
The welfare of men on shipboard...
...depends upon things that seem small.
A joke at the right moment.
A glass of grog.
A kind word would do more with seamen
than the cat-o'-nine-tails.
And this ship will be the worse...
...if possible, for his death.
Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
The natives are cannibals...
...but it's land.
The last we'll see for months.
You'd better get some rest.
You've been here for hours.
No. I can't sleep,
and it's nearly my watch.
-Well, good night.
-Roger.
-There's something l want you to do.
-Gladly. What is it?
One never knows what may happen
on a voyage Iike this.
If for any reason I don't return to England,
I want you to see my parents.
Well, why shouldn't
you return to England?
Why?
I can't stand this devil's work
much longer.
One day I'll forget this discipline
and break his neck.
Wait untiI we're back in England.
The admiralty will save you the trouble.
Well, in any case,
I'd like you to see my parents.
-Of course. Where do they live?
-In CumberIand at Maincordare.
I've almost forgotten
what the old place looks like.
I haven't seen it in 10 years.
But l do remember a tapestry in the hall...
...with ships and islands on it.
Perhaps that's what sent me off to sea.
I don't know.
In any case, I'd like you to see my home.
If anything should happen,
tell my father and mother you knew me.
-You can count on me.
Good. That's settled, then.
Mr. Byam, you're up late.
-It's fairly warm below.
I hadn't noticed. A true sailor can sleep
in an oven or on ice. Get below.
Very good, sir.
Your watch, Mr. Christian.
And I must count the coconuts.
Mr. Christian, sir.
That shark's been foIlowing us since
the surgeon died, waiting for the burial.
-Couldn't I have a musket to shoot it?
-Take the deck.
-I'lI get the keys to the arms chest.
-Two muskets.
-I'd Iike to shoot that shark onboard.
-McCoy!
It's no use. Now's our chance.
There's a lot of us here ready. And the
officers and men that won't join us....
-Well, it's them or us!
-Keep your hatch closed!
Now, get forward!
Who's there?
SaiIor hand, mate.
-Hey, what's this noise about here?
-Water, mate.
Water?
-For deserters?
-But the lad slipped his cable.
Well, here's to you slipping yours.
When I'm free, I'll wring your scrawny
pipe stem till your tongue pops out!
Tongue, is it? I'lI give you something
to remind you of that slice of shark.
You scum! Get out!
I'm sorry, lad.
Are you alI right?
Thank you, Mr. Christian, sir.
Better take care of Thompson, sir.
Murdering butcher!
I've had enough of this blood ship!
He's not master of life and death
on a quarterdeck above the angels. McCoy!
Quintal!
I'm sick of blood! Bloody backs!
Bloody faces!
Bligh, you've given your last command!
We'll be men again if we hang for it!
-You say you're ready for anything?
-Aye!
-ReIease them!
-You're taking the ship?
Mutiny?
Yes, mutiny! Pass the word.
Seize the arms chest.
We've been waiting for this!
No! Don't hit me!
Take him!
Boatswain!
No, no, don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
Now, wake up! Get into your clothes
and lose no time about it.
-What's the matter?
-What's happened?
-Have we been attacked?
-No, we've taken the ship.
And old Bligh's a prisoner.
Mutiny?
Tie him to the pipe.
Mr. Morrison! Mr. Coleman!
Shut up or I'll shut your trap for you!
Give up this madness,
or we'll all be murdered.
You're in no danger.
What wilI we do with him?
-Shoot him!
-I'lI slit his dirty throat!
See that, you butcher? My four dozen.
We'll give you 400.
-We'Il let you know what it feels like!
Flog him!
You old rogue. You'd flog us.
You'd make us eat grass.
You bluenosed baboon!
Back! Back, all of you!
No more flogging aboard this ship.
That's why we're taking it.
We'll have something to say about that!
What wilI you do with him?
Put him in a Iaunch and cast him adrift.
Give him food, water,
cutlasses and a compass.
You can have your choice.
Go with him or stay with me.
No. Slit his throat, l say,
and feed him to the sharks.
And I say go forward!
Clear the Iaunch and lower away!
Aye, aye, sir.
-Stand by, Thompson.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Lively, old buzzing bees.
What a pity, what a pity!
Every Iittle tree, perfect.
-You'Il be sure to water them?
-Never you fret. We'll water them.
We'lI take care of your plants,
here, Morgan!
You may stay onboard if you Iike,
without joining us.
No, thank you, sir.
All right. Your turn, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Christian, l give you your last chance
to return to duty.
I'll take my chance against the law.
You'll take yours against the sea.
But you're taking my ship! My ship!
Your ship? The king's ship, you mean,
and you're not fit to command it.
Into the boat!
We're ready, Churchill.
Bear a hand here, will you?
McCoy! McCoy!
Two little monkey jackets.
Loyal to Captain Bligh, eh?
Serves them right.
-Come on, lads, on deck.
I teIl you, we will!
Mr. Christian, you forgot us.
Call back the boat.
There's no more room.
You must stay with us.
-We'Il join our captain!
-We're not mutineers!
I said there was no more room!
Take them below!
Stand the guns on them!
Give them a drink!
Casting me adrift 3500 miles
from a port of call.
You're sending me to my doom, eh?
Well, you're wrong, Christian!
I'll take this boat as she floats
to England if I must!
I'll live to see you, all of you...
...hanging from the highest yardarm
in the British fleet!
Yardarms, is it? I'll give you yardarms.
Burkitt!
You're not leaving them adrift?
They'll starve or drown.
-That's Bligh's affair.
-Your friends, Morgan, Purcell--
Do you think I wanted this?
-CaIl back the boat.
-No.
-CaIl it back!
-No!
These men have been in hell.
I couldn't stand it.
-Then I must go with Bligh.
-There's no room.
Then l call on you men.
All of you, in the name of the king,
return to duty.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Give me that gun! Give me that!
Take him below.
Stand by to wear ship.
-What course, sir?
-West-northwest, Tahiti.
Tahiti, lads!
Hey, Thompson!
Here comes their water!
Sit down, Roger.
You know, there are five other men
onboard...
...who refused to take part
in the mutiny.
They've agreed not to try
and retake the ship.
You may have your liberty
under the same conditions.
I simpIy want your word for it.
You may have it.
But l'll escape if I can.
I understand.
Then l may go?
Yes, you may go.
Roger...
...l'm sorry l had to hit you.
That didn't hurt.
What hurts is that you and l
can never again be friends.
Keep her as she goes, west-northwest.
West-northwest, sir.
I presume you'lI make
for the nearest island.
No. That's certain death. The savages
in these parts are fierce cannibals.
We must keep well clear of those fellas.
By my reckoning, the first port from
which we can expect help is Timor...
...in the Dutch East Indies,
some 3500 miles away.
Then our case is hopeless.
It is by no means hopeless.
We have extra canvas, rope, a tool chest.
We'll put on every rag of sail.
That's impossible. Deeply laden as we are,
we'd fill with the first storm.
Then we'll bail with our hands
if we must.
She'll see us through if we do our part,
she wiIl!
Begging your pardon, sir,
but the food and the water.
We haven't got enough for 10 days.
If we are to reach Timor alive,
we must make it last 20, 40, 50 days.
It's the sea against us.
Mr. Bligh, we'd be pleased if you'd
ask God's blessing on our journey.
That I shall do, Mr. Fryer.
Almighty God, thou knowest our need.
Grant we acquit ourselves like men...
...in the trials and dangers
that lie before us.
BaiI!
BaiI!
BaiI faster!
BaiI faster! Bail!
Another piece, Mr. Maggs.
Thank you.
Thank you, lad.
Are we all served?
All served, sir.
Now, lads, for your own good,
eat and drink slowly.
How far have we still to go, sir?
Don't let your mind
dwell upon that, lad.
Think how far we've come.
We'll never see Portsmouth again?
We'll see Portsmouth again...
...and we'll see FIetcher Christian
hanging from a yardarm...
...and every pirate with him.
Steady, mates.
Steady.
-Mr. Fryer, take the tiller.
-Aye, sir.
Get away! I caught him!
Hey, lads! Give me that bird!
Share and share alike, lads.
The blood for the sick.
Raise him up, Mr. Maggs.
Norton, get me a cup.
This will nourish you, Mr. Morgan.
No, thank you, sir.
Give it to the youngsters.
They need it more.
Yes, Mr. Morgan,
but I'm stiIl giving the orders.
Timor, up ahead.
Timor!
Up with you. Up with you.
We've beaten the sea itself.
I hope Master Roger has
a nice Christmas, ma'am.
Thank you.
-Well, good night, ma'am.
-Good night.
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.
I beg your pardon.
WiIl there be anything more?
-Nothing more, Burrows.
-Thank you.
Christmas?
Yes, Christmas.
Peace on earth, goodwiIl to....
Come along.
A merry Christmas to you,
Mrs. Christian.
Thank you, lads.
A merry Christmas to you all.
-Same to you, sir.
-Merry Christmas, Mr. Christian.
Won't you come--?
-Roger!
-Merry Christmas, Fletcher.
Oh, thanks, lad.
I've been hoping for this for a year.
Come in. This is a day worth celebrating.
Begging your pardon, sir.
We've brought the little lady
a bit of Christmas.
Well, thanks, lad.
But she must have it from you.
Come in. Come in, lads, all of you.
Thank you, sir.
My boy was like that
when I left home, sir.
He'lI be 3 years old now.
Come on, lads.
Everybody outside for some grog.
Thank you, sir.
Isn't that a sweet baby?
Help yourself, lads!
Thank you, sir.
The surgeon's, Roger.
It would delight his soul to have us
drink it, especially on this day.
Friend. Good, good.
Ah, Hitihiti, here.
Makes head go round, round.
Come on, Byrne, drink some of this!
Where's ElIison? Ellison!
Come on!
What? A ship?
-Maybe she's Spanish.
-No.
-No, she's British-rigged.
-British?
Did you hear that, mate? British.
-British?
-She's coming for us.
We've got a chance.
The wind's against her.
She must lay outside the reef
till morning.
Get your families and your goods together!
Get aboard the Bounty!
Thompson, everyone onboard?
Burkitt and Muspratt
have gone into hiding.
The fools! They'll be taken and hanged.
Get in the boat.
Where are you taking us?
I don't know. The Pacific is filIed
with uncharted islands.
We'll find one and settle there for good.
Mr. Christian, l've got a wife and child
in England. I've got to get back.
Back? You know what that means?
A yardarm.
I must take that chance, sir.
But whatever happens,
I'll never blame you.
Thanks, lad, and I understand.
Good luck.
Well, this is goodbye, youngster.
We'll never see each other again,
that's certain.
-But I'll remember.
-I will too, Fletcher.
When you're back in England
with the fleet...
...you'lI hear the hue and cry against me.
From now on, they'll spell mutiny
with my name.
I regret that...
...but not the taking of the ship.
Every time I think of Bligh....
Well, I'd do it again.
If ever I reach England again,
I'll go to your father and tell him the truth.
Thanks.
-I'lI be happier knowing that.
-Fletcher.
What is out there for you?
Another isIand.
-Stand by. l'll be back in a moment.
-Hurry up, Byam.
When she comes around the headland,
we'lI pilot her in.
Oh, Tehani, I'll be back in two hours.
Tehani knows.
The ship may be here for months
before she sails.
But she will sail.
Byam, midshipman. Tehani knows.
Tehani, you're my wife, always.
Mrs. Roger Byam.
My wife, my darIing.
There she is, lads,
and we've nothing to fear.
We took no part in the mutiny.
Soon we'll be in England.
Thank God! Thank God!
We're returning. Good, eh?
Very good, sir. My name's Byam,
Roger Byam. This is Mr. Stewart.
We're midshipmen
of His Majesty's ship, Bounty.
Bring those men up!
Captain Bligh,
thank God you're alive, sir.
They gave me a boat and a sail,
didn't they?
Where is Fletcher Christian?
He saiIed yesterday, sir,
when your ship was sighted.
-Where to?
-I don't know, sir.
-You don't know, Stewart?
-I don't know either.
You're lying, both of you.
Sergeant, put these men in irons.
-Irons? What for?
-Mutiny.
But we're not mutineers.
A court-martial in England
will decide that.
-We're as loyal as you.
-A court-martial will decide that!
We're reporting for duty!
If we're guilty, we'd go with Christian.
When Christian took my ship,
you remained with him...
...and you'll have to answer for it.
It'll be better to tell me where he's gone!
-We don't know, sir.
-Then you'll lie in the hold...
...untiI you do know.
Sergeant, take them below!
By the mark, 12! Rocky bottom!
-To the lee helm.
-Lee helm, sir.
-Steady!
-Steady, sir.
Mark 12!
-Foretop, any sail in sight?
-No sail, sir.
-Banktop!
-No sail, sir.
By the mark, 12! Reefs ahead!
Mr. Byam, I can't understand why
he keeps us below here in irons.
You and Mr. Stewart, McIntosh,
Coleman, Byrne and myself...
...we are no mutineers.
Haven't I toId him that
time and time again?
His marines surprised me and Muspratt,
sir, or we wouldn't be here, alive.
Reefs ahead!
Attention below.
Have you decided to tell me
where Christian sailed for?
By the mark, 12! Reefs ahead!
Well, I'm waiting!
Well, stay here and rot.
My watch, I believe, Mr. Christian.
Very well, Mr. Young.
-You heathen slime!
-Enough!
I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Christian, sir,
when are you going to make a landfalI?
We're fierce sick of this.
It's more than man can stand...
...to be at sea forever in a ghost ship.
I've steered off the track of ships.
When it's safe, I'll put about for the island.
Until then you've got to trust me,
that's all.
Deep 11. Rocky bottom!
I beg you again to give up the search.
The Bounty must be lost. The ship's
dragging barnacles. The seams are open.
Men are working the pumps
day and night.
-We're still afloat, are we not?
-Only by the grace of God in these reefs.
-Ease her off a point.
Ease her off a point, sir.
I must remind you
this is one of His Majesty's ships.
Mr. Edwards, I intend to bring back
Fletcher Christian.
Unless he's hanging from a yardarm,
not one of His Majesty's ships is safe.
Mutiny and piracy
will be rampant in the fleet.
-But we'll lose the ship.
-Then we'll lose it!
As Iong as I have a deck under me,
I'll search for that man.
Fourteen!
To starboard!
Old Bligh's a seaman.
The rocks are so thick, a fish
couldn't swim between them...
-...without rubbing off his scales.
By the mark, 8!
Eight fathom! Let's hope
we're moored before night...
...or the sharks wiIl have us.
By the mark, 2!
Breakers ahead.
Hard alee!
What's happened?
-Hard to port!
-Very good, sir!
Haul out both of them!
Get the doors!
Captain Bligh!
Get us out! We'll drown!
Lift with them and turn around!
Captain Bligh! Let us out of here!
Save your voice, man!
Take charge of the aft boat.
Captain Bligh, get us out of here!
-Get those men out!
-Aye, aye, sir! Come on, men!
Hurry up, soldier!
-The first boat's ready.
-Take them out.
Make for the Australian coast.
Prisoners go with me in the other boat.
-Very good, sir. God be with you.
-God be with you.
Hurry up with you down there.
Thank you. You saved our lives.
Mr. Byam, I wouldn't lose you
for a flagship. Get into the boat!
How long has this triaI been going on?
About a week now.
They should reach a verdict soon.
Oh, there, there, child.
But they won't let me see him.
Why won't they let me see him?
If l could see him to taIk to him,
he'd know I trust him.
-He knows that, darling.
-Oh, but it's crueI. Cruel.
They can't hang him!
There's the signal.
The trial is opened again.
On the 15th day of September, 1792...
...for mutiny on His Majesty's ship,
Bounty.
Call Mr. Fryer.
Mr. Fryer.
Do you swear by God
any evidence you give...?
Besides the leader, did you see any
of the prisoners now before this court...
...in arms?
Yes, milord.
lnform the court.
Seaman Burkitt and Seaman
Muspratt were armed with muskets.
Seaman Ellison was armed
with a bayonet.
Have any of the accused
any questions to put to this witness?
Yes, milord.
Good morning, Mr. Fryer.
Oh, good morning, lad.
Mr. Fryer, you say I was armed
with a bayonet.
-Did you see me use it?
-By no means, lad.
Address your replies to the court.
-Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
He merely flourished it
under Captain Bligh's nose...
...and called him a few names.
Names? What names did he call him?
Sir, he--
He calIed him a bluenosed baboon.
Have you any more questions
to ask the witness?
No, milord.
That is all.
Milord, I should like to ask
a few questions of Captain Bligh.
Very well, Captain NeIson.
-CaIl Captain Bligh.
-Captain Bligh.
Captain Bligh, in the previous evidence
given before this court...
...you failed to make clear
one very important point:
A motive for the mutiny.
Can you tell us why your men
took your ship?
No, sir. Until I was seized
in the cabin, I suspected nothing.
A circumstance occurred
the night before...
...which should have aroused
my suspicions.
Going on deck, l found Fletcher Christian
and Roger Byam...
...talking together at the rail.
I heard Roger Byam say,
"You can count on me."
I heard Christian reply,
"Good. That's settled."
I saw them shake hands.
I realized afterwards they
were plotting to seize the Bounty.
But that's not true, Captain Bligh.
Milord, gentlemen, let me explain.
If the prisoner so desires,
he may question the witness.
Captain Bligh, you've not repeated
my whole talk with Fletcher Christian.
Did you not hear him tell me
about his home in Cumberland?
I did not.
Well, did you not
hear him ask my promise...
...that if he did not return, I would
tell his parents what had happened?
I did not.
I swear before God
and before this court...
...that was the content
of my talk with Christian.
It had nothing to do with mutiny.
Captain Bligh, apart from
the conversation you overheard...
...was Mr. Byam's previous conduct
such that you believe him guilty?
Sir, his entire conduct convinces me
that he plotted with Christian.
They were friends before the mutiny.
They remained friends after the mutiny.
When I arrived, the prisoner
could've arrested Christian.
But he aIlowed him to escape.
On his own admittance.
Yes, but you knew I was trapped
on the island, perhaps for years.
Outnumbered, unarmed.
I gave my word to Christian
not to move against him.
Mr. Byam, if you were loyal
when Christian escaped...
...l should have found you dead.
I have nothing more to ask him.
I can onIy say again to this court,
I am not guilty of mutiny.
If that is so, why did you not join
your captain when he was cast adrift?
I was below pIanning a counterattack
to regain the ship from the mutineers.
With whom did you plan the attack?
Sir, with my messmate,
Midshipman Stewart.
Milord...
...Midshipman Stewart died
in the Pandora's boat.
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
Can't they ever reach a verdict?
I'm that sick of waiting, I could stamp
on a litter of wildcats...
...and never feel a scratch.
Well, what are you Iooking at?
It ain't Tahiti. lt's only Portsmouth.
I thought she might row by in a boat.
Who, the queen?
No, my wife.
Sorry, lad.
Why can't I see her?
My wife, my boy...
...that's all I've come back for.
I knew they'd hang me.
But l've got to see them.
I've got to see them!
Blast these sea captains!
Who made their sea law?
God didn't. The burning killers!
Lad! We're all in the same boat, Tom.
They won't let me see my mother.
Won't you help us now
by holding on?
Yes, sir.
Roger Byam?
Follow me, please.
-Sir Joseph.
-My lad, they've reached a verdict.
-Watch the dirk.
-The dirk?
The midshipman's dirk wilI be lying
on the table before Lord Hood.
If it lies crosswise,
you've been acquitted.
If the point lies toward you,
you've been condemned.
God be with you.
Thank you, sir.
Prisoner and escort, halt.
Left, hut.
Have you anything to say
before the sentence of this court...
...is passed upon you?
Milord, much as l desire to live,
I'm not afraid to die.
Since I first sailed on the Bounty
four years ago...
...l've known how men can be made
to suffer worse things than death.
Cruelly, beyond duty, beyond necessity.
Captain Bligh, you've told your story
of mutiny on the Bounty.
How men plotted against you,
seized your ship...
...cast you adrift in an open boat.
A great venture in science brought
to nothing. Two British ships lost.
But there's another story,
Captain Bligh...
...of 10 coconuts and two cheeses.
A story of a man who robbed his
seamen, cursed them, flogged them.
Not to punish, but to break their spirit.
A story of greed and tyranny...
...and of anger against it,
of what it cost.
One man, milord,
would not endure such tyranny.
That's why you hounded him. That's
why you hate him, hate his friends.
And that's why you're beaten.
Fletcher Christian's still free.
But Christian lost too, milord.
God knows he's judged himself
more harshly than you could judge him.
I say to his father, he was my friend.
No finer man ever lived.
I don't try to justify his crime,
his mutiny...
...but l condemn the tyranny
that drove him to it.
I don't speak here for myself alone,
but for these men you've condemned.
I speak in their names and FIetcher
Christian's name for all men at sea.
These men don't ask for comfort.
They don't ask for safety.
If they couId speak to you, they'd say:
"Let us choose to do our duty willingly.
Not the choice of a slave,
but that of free Englishmen."
They ask onIy the freedom
that EngIand expects for every man.
If one man among you believed that--
One man.
He could command the fleets of England.
He could sweep the seas for EngIand.
If he called his men to their duty
not by flaying their backs...
...but by lifting their hearts...
...their....
That's all.
Roger Byam, midshipman.
Having heard the evidence against you
and having heard your own defense...
...the sentence of this court is
you shall suffer death by hanging...
...onboard such of His Majesty's ships
of war and at such time...
...as the commissioners for executing
the office of lord high admiral...
...of Great Britain and Ireland
shall direct.
Prisoner and escort, into file.
Left, turn. Quick, hut.
I pronounce this court dissolved.
Milord, may I congratulate the court?
Captain Bligh, in my opinion,
your open-boat voyage...
...was the most remarkable conduct
of navigation in the history of the sea.
I must admire your seamanship
and courage, but....
Detachment, fall in.
Thanks, mate.
I've seen them, sir,
thanks to you and your friends.
The wife, she's well, sir.
And the boy, blow me,
I hardly knew him, he's growed so.
You wouldn't believe it,
the dead spit of me.
I'm gIad, Tom.
Look, sir. Like the one she gave me
the day we sailed for Tahiti.
Do you know, sir,
that sailing seems like a dream.
As far away as the islands are.
I remember how Mr. Christian
talked to me that day.
Cheered me up, he did.
Where do you think he is now, sir?
I'd give anything to know.
One thing's certain,
he's taken that ship beyond maps.
I wonder if he found his isIand.
Well, sir, what did you find?
-Your new home, lads.
There she is, Pitcairn's Island.
There's no place to land.
That's why I chose it. I plan to run
the Bounty in head-on, then burn her.
-Burn her?
-We'd be fools to burn her.
We'll be fools if we don't.
If there's one spar left in sight,
we'lI never be safe.
Sir, we can't burn the ship.
-We can never get back.
There's no way back, lad.
Once ashore, we're there to stay.
But this ship's our last tie with home.
Yon's a lonely rock to die on.
It's enough to live on.
There's sun and earth and water.
It can be a helI or a home
as we choose to make it.
We'll remember this as long
as we live and regret it.
And remember why we took this ship.
They can't press-gang you there, they
can't starve you, and can't flog you.
We're not afraid of a new life.
As Iong as we can live it with decency
and self-respect, we can and we must.
For ourselves and our children.
Well, hands for burning?
-I say burn her, hull and sticks.
Aye, aye.
Very well. We'll get the women
and children ashore...
...and then stand by to take her in.
Aye, sir.
She makes a grand light, sir.
Good English oak.
Discipline has been maintained.
The mutineers who confessed
have been punished.
But we're here to plead
for the life of Roger Byam...
...because we believe him innocent.
And there is more at stake here,
Your Majesty, than his Iife.
We do not exaggerate
when we say a new understanding...
...between officers and men
has come to the fleet.
By returning Byam to duty, Your Majesty
will confirm that understanding.
And not for today only,
but for all time to come.
Everyone aboard?
-The last shore boat's coming alongside.
-Make ready for sea.
Very good, sir.
-Ship ready for sea, sir.
-Very good.
Midshipman Byam,
reporting for duty.
-You take the mizzenmast, Byam.
-Very good.
-Very glad to have you with us, lad.
-Thank you, sir.
-May I, Byam?
-Of course.
We're off to the Mediterranean, lad.
We'll sweep the seas for England.
Sir?
