The government is going
to call off all garbage runs.
We are being driven out of this place.
This is not fair to the people
who live here.
If the epidemic is really prevailing
in this area...
they should have done something
a long time ago...
but they didn't do a thing about it.
They didn't try to protect us.
Now look at us. The disease is
wide-spread and everyone is sick.
Now they want us to move into tents
and schools like refugees.
Why should I cooperate with them?
With no prevention,
the epidemic will break out.
THE HOLE
What if we were
carrying the virus?
You can't just move us
anywhere you want to.
Some people have
lived here for generations.
The government can't make us
leave our homes.
A TSAI MING-LIANG FILM
I'll just dump my rubbish anywhere.
To hell with our government.
I'll dump my garbage where I can't see it,
or somewhere other people can't see it.
Or I'll just put them wherever
other people put them...
They should burn us all,
together with the garbage!
Taiwan's Health Administration...
has issued a statement...
in response to sharp criticism
from WHO.
Though we haven't been able to identify
the name of this epidemic or its origin,
we are very confident that
we can take care of it in the shortest time.
The Water Company
also announced...
that starting in the year 2000...
it will cut off the water supply
to all quarantine zones.
And now here's our report.
"After thorough consideration, 
We have come to this painful decision. "
"In compliance with
the government's all-out evacuation"
"this company will cut off
all water supplies to quarantine zones..."
"starting midnight, January 1st, 2000. "
"For those who still live
in the quarantine zone, please leave. "
"Do not hesitate. "
"It would be foolish to assume..."
"one can live on rainwater. "
"It is impossible. "
Seven days to go now...
until the year 2000.
Excuse me.
Are there any leaks in here?
Nope.
There's a bad leak downstairs.
One wall is dripping wet.
They asked me to check around.
Can I have a look inside?
But there's no problem here.
There could be
a busted pipe still.
I really need to have a look.
Just a peek.
Thanks.
Sorry for the bother.
Don't water your plants
with tap water. 
Let it sit in a container
for 2 or 3 days. 
The take surface water only, 
using a bowl, 
to water your plants with it. 
But what about drinking water? 
Some families
don't have a water purifier. 
In the past, 
they used to boil the water... 
for 3 to 5 minutes... 
to get rid of chlorine or nitrogen. 
The only thing is that you have to finish
the water in two or three days. 
How about the pipes? 
The pipes... 
In the area of Shihlin this afternoon... 
a man was found
hiding under his bed for 8 hours. 
Chang Gung Hospital, 
where he was later admitted, 
has confirmed he is the latest victim
of this end-of-the-millennium virus, 
following two reported outbreaks
in both the Hsimen and Wanhwa areas. 
Panic is rising in the Shihlin area. 
The government
is watching the situation closely. 
More details in our midnight report. 
And now we'll introduce you to the fine
culinary art of instant noodles! 
Our first dish: 
instant noodles with pickles. 
The ingredients are simple. 
Let's choose our pickles. 
If you have Korean style pickles at home... 
it will be perfect. 
If you don't like the spicy Korean pickles, 
Chinese pickles work just as well. 
Other then pickles, 
we also need packs of instant noodles. 
Four packs if it's a dinner for four, 
one if you're cooking for yourself!! 
What kind of noodle? 
Any kind! 
It can be with bean sauce, 
beef, pork paste, herbs and ribs... 
as you like it! 
Be it "Mi-Mi," "Wantze,"
or "President.‚Äù
Any brand will do. 
Enough talk, 
Miss Spice Girl starts cooking now! 
And now we'll boil the water. 
I know you can manage that! 
Get yourself a pot and just add water. 
As I told you before, 
let the water boil
for at least 10 minutes, 
or it'll give you diarrhea. 
We don't want that, do we? 
So remember
what Miss Spice Girl said: 
at least 10 minutes! 
Okay, pour the water into the pot. 
That should do. 
That's enough
for one pack of noodles. 
A large bowl of water. 
Bring it to a boil for 10 minutes, 
and cook for 3 minutes maximum. 
For al dente, 2 minutes will do... 
Oh Calypso, Oh Calypso
I hop, I jump, I love the Calypso! 
Oh Calypso, Oh Calypso
Don't tell me I'll get tired of it
Twist and turn, 
let's all do the Calypso! 
I strut like a proud
and handsome rooster
Arms flapping, chin up, 
everyone shout hooray! 
I move one step forward
and one step back
I twist and I turn
with endless pleasure
I really don't need
to pour my heart out
I just follow the drum
and find the right beat
To forget my hard day
of endless labors
Nights are made
for sweet and carefree joy... 
Oh Calypso, Oh Calypso
I hop, I jump, I love the Calypso! 
Oh Calypso, Oh Calypso
Don't tell me I'll get tired of it
Twist and turn, 
let's all do the Calypso! 
Oh Calypso, Oh Calypso
I hop, I jump, I love the Calypso! 
Oh Calypso, Oh Calypso
Don't tell me I'll get tired of it
Twist and turn, 
let's all do the Calypso! 
Don't tell me I'll get tired of it
Twist and turn, 
let's all do the Calypso! 
Don't tell me I'll get tired of it
Twist and turn, 
let's all do the Calypso! 
Kitty.
Kitty!
Kitty.
Can I help you, sir?
Do you have this kind of bean sauce?
This brand was discontinued
long time ago.
We have the same thing but only in
different brand.

Go away, don't come back
Come on now, take a hike
You're a nuisance, 
You don't stand a chance
I will never hold you back! 
Go away, don't come back
Come on now, take a hike
You're a nuisance, 
You don't stand a chance
'Cause you're always talking back! 
Don't call me your Tiger Lady
You are not the perfect hubby
You're so penniless, 
Completely useless
What a nasty jealous sod, you! 
Go away, don't come back

You're a nuisance, 
You don't stand a chance
'Cause you're always talking back
Don't talk back
Don't call me your Tiger Lady
You are not the perfect hubby
You're so penniless, 
Completely useless
What a nasty jealous sod, you! 
Go away, don't come back
Come on now, take a hike
You're a nuisance, 
You don't stand a chance
'Cause you're always talking back
you always talk back... 
Talking, talking, talking, talking... 
I won't be your Tiger Lady no more! 
Come out of there!
Stop it, please!
You hear me?
Get out of there.
Be a man!
Get out now!
Please, get out.
What are you doing?
Please, stop it.
You're scaring me to death.
Get out now, please.
Are you the tenant of Apt. No. 804?
I'm your downstairs neighbor.
The plumber will come
and fix the hole this afternoon.
Will you be home then?
Maybe.
You have to.
Or else it'll never get fixed.
What do you mean,
"It doesn't matter"?
Do you think you're the only plumber
left alive around here?
You think you're so damn good?
- Did you just use the toilet?
- Why?
Because there's a leak
above my toilet.
Can you stop using yours?
I'll ask the plumber to fix it.
What are you doing here?
Drunk again?
What are you doing in there?
Get a hold of him!
Open the door.
Just leave the stretcher here.
In the most bizarre case so far, 
a patient was found
hiding in the sewer for 6 hours. 
They're like roaches. 
They fear light. 
A French virologist
from the Institute Pasteur, 
Dr. Carpentier, 
suggested that the virus be called
"the Taiwan Virus"...
and the epidemic, 
"Taiwan Fever. "
The crisis team announced its findings
in a conference today. 
It seems that the patients
first develop flu-like symptoms. 
Days later, they develop
bug-like behaviors such as crawling, 
photophobia and a tendency to hide
in dark and humid corners. 
Experts call it
a "roach-like crawling. "
It is suspected that the cockroach
is the host insect of the virus. 
Dr. Carpentier says the cockroach
is the host insect of various viruses... 
and a known allergic factor. 
Its body and excrement
contain a special protein. 
This kind of protein
can withstand hours of intense heat. 
Sir, this place is going
to be fumigated. It's not safe.
Please leave for now.
I... 
I want... 
I want you... 
I want you to... 
What I want is your love
So why don't you come a bit closer? 
I... 
I want... 
I want you...

What I want is your love
So why don't you speak to me
sweeter? 
I... 
I want...

What I want is your love
So why don't you talk to me
sweeter? 
So why don't you say
Oh why don't you say
Why don't you say
that you love me? 
Coconut milk?
Where can I find any
in such foul weather?
I want some now.
I mean it. Now!
What can I do?
Stripping.
Undressing myself.
You want a look?
You want a look?
I'm lying down now.
I'm looking at the hole
you made in the ceiling.
There's an eye staring at me.
Kitty.
Kitty.
Do you know
what a woman needs most?
Wrong.
Wrong again.
Keep guessing.
Guess again.
And?
I love it.
Gesundheit!
I don't have a cold at all. 
And I am not
that Snow White's red-nosed dwarf
So why then am I sneezing all day long? 
Something here must be wrong! 
Maybe some cute admirer
Is calling my name over and over
In secret, and I am sneezing so strong
Yes, I am all day long! 
Last week it was Lee
And he was down on his knee
Saying we had to marry
He'd spend his life pleasuring me
And happy we would be! 
Now there is Gee
This one keeps bullying me
He really wants to have me
This guy will not let me free
But marriage ain't for me! 
It has to be them somehow
Calling my name over and over now
And that's why I am sneezing
all day long
Yes, I am, all day long!

I don't care who you are
But darling, hold me close
Alone together, you and me
Come the days of wine and roses
I don't care who you are
But in your arms I cling
Alone together, in the dark
Come the days of carefree spring
Swallows twirling in the blue skies
Mandarin ducks in the quiet pond
Tell me, oh tell me why, 
I do not know
Why do they never part... 
In the year 2000,
we are grateful that we still have
Grace Chang's songs to comfort us.
