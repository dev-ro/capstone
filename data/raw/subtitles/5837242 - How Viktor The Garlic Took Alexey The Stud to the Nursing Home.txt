You are welcome.
Thank you.
Congratulations!
Hello!
Hello!
Do you still have money left?
Just a second.
You are denied.
Che?
In granting a loan, you are denied.
Maybe a mistake what?
How refused, I do not understand...
I'm sorry, but that's right.
Well, how, so-so?
You are damned.
I told you that I will kill you!
Calm down!
Eight hundred and sixty-two
rubles. Right now, a minute.
Hey! How are you?
Che?
Do not check,
we must talk.
You'll excuse me,
that drove you away then,
nerves to hell.
This I made
district police to find you.
Well, the truth is,
hoped that they would not.
I did not tell you the whole truth then
about the apartment.
Well, that is disinterested,
I work overtime there. This is not true,
more precisely not absolutely so.
I have an interest.
Yes, apartment. I want a daughter
with grandchildren
there to infuse. Che?
Do not understand?
And what is not clear?
I'm courting him.
And in case of refusal or absence
relatives, he, as a token of gratitude,
he rewrites the apartment to me.
No, I do not blame you,
such a daddy and I would
not let on the threshold.
You have your own life,
their sorrow. And he let though
and... but still a person.
Care is needed.
So what?
Che?
Failure to write?
What is the refusal?
Like what?
From the apartment.
Aha.
You're the heir.
While he is alive, I will follow him.
You're not going to?
And how will die,
my daughter is here.
I agree?
Yes, do not worry,
I'm not for free.
I will pay.
How many?
200 thousand rubles
immediately.
Well,
I agree?
Hey, wait, I did not understand.
Che did not you understand?
So you will write a refusal?
Of course not.
How?
I... I'm the same...
I shit him for cleaning.
Hello, Lariss!
I'm here from morning till night.
Let's go for a walk.
You just
spit on him, huh?
Come on, I'll be right there.
Spit!
Damn, my hand stiffened.
The sofa you have
in general uncomfortable.
Nitsche, but I will
soon have my own hut.
Over there
I'll put myself a normal tractor.
Yes, all right, where
did you get the hut,
You're a beggar.
Yes, my dad was found,
and he the other
day must glue the fins,
and I will get the hut
by inheritance...
And che...
Che?
Do you want to
live with me weakly?
And you, Che, will you go?
And when will your daddy die?
Do I know that?
One of these days should...
Well... Absolutely bad.
We also had a grandmother, lay...
We thought - tomorrow,
the day after tomorrow.
And she still one and a half year
a vegetable lived
Well, Che, do not kill him now.
And you hand it over.
To whom?
Not to whom, but where.
Where?
In a wheelchair.
And, che, it is possible?
I wrote a statement,
what care
there is no possibility.
Directory collected...
All. And they sent zayavochku
look for an almshouse,
where places are.
Not well it somehow all.
I do not understand,
che is not good?
Well no...
Yes, you agree,
Th is not good?
Well, what do you want from him,
how to get rid of garbage.
Well, you're a nit,

Well, maybe you can get him,

To you your dad,
probably, are great
bought, did you go fishing?
And I've seen how mother
I was hanging in a loop
For the fact that this handon threw it.
She would, bitch, rejoice
that he finally abandoned her,
and she's in a
loop because of this
climbed...
And then 12 years,
from call to ring,
in the orphanage...
If only someone would ask...
No.
No one fucking orange
for the New Year
not sent.
He pityed him...
You would have pity on me.
... And I
fist balls on the balls!
Has developed
in half...
What...
Well, honestly,
Well, sorry for a second,
sorry... And I told him
scissors in the hare,
again with this
I'll see by now -

A son.
Sign it.
And where are the things going?
Take away.
Food.
Hey, you, by the window!
I?
Yes!
Look there red
does the car cost?
Worth it.
And now?
Here, here!
She left!
You are near me
And I'm ready to be through
What am I to you?
I'll believe
Here is my hand for you
Do not be afraid of anything
And do not let her go.
Whatever happens tomorrow
I'll be there so know
I will be near
I will be near
