December 1933
People always described me
as being so distracted.
Hey!
Where are you heading to?
I'm delivering seaweed to Futaba
in Nakajima Honmachi.
This is usually my brother's
job, but he has a cold so...
I must fu... fulfill...
It's okay.
You don't have to be so formal.
Don't mind the gravel
on the floor.
After I'm done,
I'm buying treats for
my brother and sister.
I see.
Look. We're almost there.
Hey, stop gazing off into space!
"Year's End Market"
Chocolate, 10 sen.
Box of caramels, 10 sen.
Small box, 5 sen.
Yo-yo, 10 sen.
I want the red one.
Business is still busy.
Thank you for coming. Take care.
The sky's brilliance
Flows into my heart
Today again, I gaze far away
And tears trickle down
White clouds keep drifting past
While dreams entangle about
Wavering, fleeting
Sadness enveloping
It pains me to ponder
This emptiness evermore
Will salvation ever come?
In This Corner of the World
Then I got lost,
and I met an old man.
Suzu,
what is that?
A monster.
At least that's what he said.
He lent me his telescope
and told me to find my way.
Wow! I can see really well!
Then I fell into his basket
and met an older boy.
He's a kidnapper and
we're being kidnapped.
What? Oh, no...
I have to feed the chicken
before it gets dark.
I have to ride the train
back home with my dad.
Me too, me too.
I have to go home
before night fall or else...
Or else what happens?
You'll see soon enough.
- Hey mister.
- Oh! Ouch!
What is that? Take a look!
Let me see.
He falls asleep when it gets dark.
Too bad he'll miss supper.
Thanks, Suzu Urano!
How do you know my name?
"Thanks, Suzu Urano!"
Hey! Keep it down!
I'm so distracted at times.
I'm sure I was daydreaming again
August 1935
The sea was just here last night,
but now it's all gone
with the spring tide.
Crossing the sea all on our own!
First time ever! This is fun!
I'll greet our uncle, aunt
and grandma in Kusatsu first.
I'll say "Our parents will join us later."
"Please have this watermelon".
I wanna hold the watermelon!
Quiet!
Hey!
There's no time to play around!
My brother was quite
the stern type.
Good morning...
Our parents will...
Please...
Please have this... watermelon.
Thanks, our ancestors will appreciate it.
You look so pretty.
Our grandma sews us
a new kimono every year.
Our parents joined us
after shopping
and we visited our family grave.
How's business?
It's tough.
Is that so?
There are ups and downs,
but it's not all bad,
being young.
I think it lets me see
different things.
H... hello.
Excuse me...
Would you like some more?
Grandma.
Wake up.
The tide is pulling out.
Get ready.
Sumi, you too.
Come on.
Leave it there, she will have it later.
So if I leave my kimono there,
Will she wear it, too?
You're so kind, Suzu.
"Must've been a zashiki-warashi,
a house spirit.
Teacher told me about them."
My brother explained
to me later.
That dusk, everything looked
hazy but gentle.
You left your kimono in Kusatsu?
Swim back and get it right now!
Stupid!
"My ogre brother"
I forgot how scary my
ogre of a brother could be.
February 1938
Suzu, put it lower.
The wind could blow it away.
Mom, can you give me 2 sen?
I lost my pencil.
Wait for your allowance.
You need to stop doodling.
- Sumi, let's trade pencils.
- No.
Suzu, is Tetsu Mizuhara
going to school every day?
Um, I think so.
What a cold day.
Oh, you're cold!
Oh.
It's so short!
I hope it'll last the week.
Don't lose it again, ok?
"Reading"
"Math "
"Science"
Draw anything you want today.
You may leave after you hand it in.
"Art"
Yes, sir!
What should we draw?
Nice job, Urano.
Very impressive.
I wish I could draw like you.
I'm home.
I'll gather some pine
needles for kindling.
Thank you dear.
Umm...Mizuhara?
You won't be able to go home
until you finish drawing.
I don't want to go home.
My parents drink all day instead
of working with seaweed.
I hate the ocean.
I won't draw it.
Urano, give me your hand.
Take it.
But I can't.
It's my brother's,
I have plenty more.
The rabbits are
hopping about today.
The sea was like this when a
ship capsized at New Year's.
If you want to draw,
then draw this stupid ocean
Mizuhara, what did you
mean earlier?
Oh, the white waves
look like rabbits hopping.
Hey, Mizuhara,
can I give my brother to you?
No way.
All the guys run when they see him coming.
But still better than the idiot
who joined the Navy and drowned.
You're right,
they look like white rabbits.
I'm done.
Here you go.
Oh, thanks...
You shouldn't have bothered.
Now I have to go home.
And with a drawing like this,
I can't hate the ocean anymore.
March 1940
Imperial Navy Forces conducting
operations
in the Eastern Pacific have...
December 1941
Hurray! Hurray!
April 1943
Pick the seaweeds over here.
December 1943
Yes.
Oh,
Lovely decisive
combat battledress.
That's cold!
You've gotten quite good. We'll
have lunch when you're ready.
Okay!
That's far!
You're going far away
to get married.
I am?
Sumi, you're staying near.
They say girls who hold their
chopsticks up top wed far away.
Really?
Where did you come from, Grandma?
I came from Furue.
That's just one village over.
Women who end up in Manchuria
must be using tongs.
Says Sumi, as she shifts
her grip on her chopsticks.
But marrying close to home
isn't very exciting.
Suzu, run back home!
I just got a call...
A boy all the way
from Kure is here
asking for your hand
in marriage.
Kure?
Suzu, how old are you?
I'm about 19...
Well actually, 18.
You can always turn him down,
but at least go and meet him.
Suzu, come here a bit.
I want you to have this.
I made it for the day you wed.
I hope it'll work out for you.
Thank you.
The wedding will be in their
house in Kure.
On your wedding night,
he'll ask,
"Did you bring an umbrella?"
You'll answer,
"I brought a brand new one."
Then he will ask,
"Can I open it?"
You must say "Yes", okay?
But why?
Because you have to.
I guess I'm becoming an adult.
Kure...
There's a naval port there, and
it's full of sailors, I think...
Eh? Mizuhara?
It's been a while.
Hurry home.
Your mom made such a fuss,
everybody already knows.
Oh, gosh!
I thought you were the suitor!
Don't be silly!
I just came home for my
brother's memorial.
You don't know who
your suitor is?
No idea.
Maybe he has me
confused with Sumi.
Sumi is prettier than me.
I don't think so.
My son took a shine to your
daughter on his way to school.
It wasn't easy to
find your house.
We lost the seaweed business
to land reclamation
three years ago.
She should be home any minute.
I can't tell if marrying
would be good.
I wonder, why did I
taste caramel in my mouth...
It's so cold...
What should I do?
They say I could turn him down,
but I don't
even know if I like him or not.
Excuse me.
Yes?
We lost our way.
Where is the train station?
- This way.
- Thank you.
A nice sailor showed us the way,
but...
Oh, him? He's an odd one,
you see.
They said an odd woman in the
woods showed them the way.
February 1944
Am I so distracted that I lose
track of what's going on?
How did this all
happen so quickly?
"Hiroshima"
"Kaitaichi"
"Yano"
"Saka"
"Koyaura"
Please close the blinds
facing the ocean.
Someone left a window open...
Next stop, Kure.
The Naval battery must
be doing drills.
Sorry.
The wood gas bus couldn't get up
the hill, could it?
Hello, Mrs. Kobayashi.
Thank you for having us.
I'm glad the weather is nice.
While I am lacking in my ways, I
am honored to join your family.
I'm Kobayashi, Shusaku's aunt.
I'll be your matchmaker today.
You do know your husband-to-be's
last name, right?
Definitely lacking in many ways.
We've climbed so high!
They live on the far corner here.
Here we are.
"Houjo"
They're here!
My apologies for such a
simple wedding.
Simple suits our girl just fine.
Oh no!
My beautiful kimono is
all covered up.
Suzu!
What on earth are you doing!
What a feast.
I'm sorry her brother
couldn't come.
This is impressive.
Well, you provided us with
the ingredients.
This includes supper as well
so make sure to eat up.
This stew is delicious.
He seems very reserved.
You're lucky.
No one would be noisy
at a wedding.
Except for you.
See you when you come
home to visit!
See you then!
I'll see you around.
Wait... who was that, again?
Now that she's here,
you can rest and have
her take over.
I will.
Mom, Dad, it's an honor to be
part of your family.
The honor is ours.
I have a bad leg so,
I'm counting on you, Suzu.
Of course.
Thank you.
Keiko always burns the pot.
Right! She's the daughter
who got married.
Naval ships are doing
search light drills.
Where have I ended up?
Thank you for setting out the futons.
Sure.
Oh, Suzu?
Yes?
Did you bring an umbrella?
Yes, I have.
It's brand new.
Can I borrow it?
Here.
You must be hungry.
Were the dried
persimmons too bitter?
You didn't eat at the wedding.
I'm glad you can eat
with your mouth.
Yes, don't worry. I even swallowed
the seed.
With my mouth.
Have we met before?
We have. Don't you remember?
I'm sorry.
I tend to be distracted and
unaware of my surroundings.
You haven't changed at all.
I also remember your
beauty mark.
We share the neighborhood well.
"To Yoichi Urano"
"Houjo..."
"Suzu Houjo"
Excuse me.
What might be the address
of this house?
"Kami-Naganoki cho 808"
Of course!
We're off.
Have a nice day.
Everyone around here seems
to work for the Navy.
Mrs. Houjo?
Mrs. Houjo?
Ah, yes!
"Rationing duty"?
Remember, these two are
always at it.
Nice to meet you.
- I'm Chita.
- I'm Kariya.
There you go again!
I'm measuring properly
You're eyeballing it!
- No I'm not.
- It's unfair!
It is not!
- Unbelievable.
- What is?
You and your ways.
What ways?
Haha, I'm young, don't worry!
It's gonna fall!
Oops!
Ouch...
I'm so sorry.
That possibility cannot
be ruled out.
If incendiary bombs come down,
first you must timely counter
and neutralize...
Come closer!
It's so chilly in here.
This has become my daily life.
March 1944
That's Keiko's dress from
when she was younger.
It goes in the storage.
She wore that on dates with her husband.
They'd go to the cinema,
fancy restaurants, and exhibits.
She was quite the modern lady.
Those were the days.
When Shusaku was in the
fourth grade,
the "disarmament for peace"
treaty shut down
warship production.
My husband and neighbors lost
their jobs. It was a hard blow.
But Keiko found a job and
a husband all on her own.
Well! I'll work just as hard!
We thought those
times were tough.
How I miss those days now.
Hello.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Humdrum...
Humdrum? How? Rice is
such a luxury now!
I'm talking about you!
I expected a sophisticated
city girl from Hiroshima.
What's that rag you're wearing?
Are you roasting beans?
Hello Harumi.
Mommy is mad about
everything lately.
So I stay quiet.
I'm sorry, it's all I've got...
Then make one right now.
Also, that rice isn't a gift,
it's for me and Harumi.
Keiko...
But, Mom!
Oh, dear. What should I do?
Ouch!
Not again, not like that!
No one will marry you
if you don't do it right.
That's fine. Then I won't marry.
What's it like at the waist...?
I see.
I undo the seams and cut.
Put them together and sew.
Put in a waistband and I'm done!
I'm Harumi Kuromura.
I'm Suzu Houjo.
Can I have some string?
Will this do?
Oops.
Are you going shopping?
Yes, to get rations.
I'll go. Hand me your
ration coupon and wallet.
Are you sure? Thank you.
Welcome home.
Stop. I'll do it.
Hey, Mom!
I'm coming. What is it, dear?
What should we do for soup?
Just the two of you?
Welcome home, Dad.
Make yourself at home, Keiko.
What a surprise.
My big sis didn't burn the rice.
Shusaku!
Excuse me.
Thank you,
I was able to fix my kimono.
My pleasure.
Our mother has a bad leg,
and we brought someone like
you to a place you don't know.
If only I could've stayed.
Suzu. Why don't you
go home to Hiroshima?
What?
That's a good idea.
"Hiroshima Castle, Suzu Urano"
I'm home.
I'm so tired.
Welcome home.
It's eight already.
That's quite a pile.
These are all
thousand-person-stitch sashes?
Yes. Sumi, make sure to
stitch each one.
Okay.
Suzu! Enough sleeping! Get up!
Y... yes!
It's time for dinner.
Oh gosh. I dreamt I
married a man in Kure.
Are you awake now?
My sister-in-law said
I should think about going
back to Hiroshima.
I was puzzled at first.
Oh, to visit my family!
Then my in-laws apologized
for not letting me come
visit sooner.
They told me to relax
for a couple of days.
Uh, if that's what you want,
isn't that nice?
Did you write to Yoichi?
I did.
I haven't heard from him,
though.
- You too?
- Nothing.
He's stationed far away.
And he doesn't write much.
Suzu might've written
the wrong address, too.
Bath time!
How's the volunteer corps?
I'm getting used to it.
Don't I smell like machine oil?
It must be a dangerous job.
It's not as cold as harvesting
seaweed.
There are good
things about it.
A handsome high-ranking officer
slips me his meal tickets.
Oh my!
I think I just accidentally
learned some Army secret!
How about you? Do you like Kure?
I don't know yet.
There's so much to learn.
Maybe I did just tell you a
Navy secret!
- What?
- Good night!
Suzu?
Yeah?
You're getting a bald spot.
Bye Suzu! I'm off to work.
Emergency policies
start next month.
Even short travels will
be restricted.
Take care.
I will.
Time for me to go
to the women's association.
What? You're leaving, too?
"Railroads fight too"
Dad gave me an allowance.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Hiroshima.
"Tickets Sold Out"
What?
That's why you came back?
I feel bad for the Houjo family.
I'm home.
April 1944
Keiko stayed all along.
Mommy, can I borrow the ink?
What for?
I wanna use it.
Suzu?
What did you tell Harumi?
Can I take care of the
community notices?
Sure.
I'll go now, then.
She's been a bit off since
coming back from Hiroshima.
Let her be. She's still a child.
Thank you for your time.
- Please!
- I said no!
Lend me the ink brush.
You don't need it.
Welcome home.
Picking herbs?
Yes. For tonight's supper.
I see.
Dandelions here are white.
Are they different in Eba?
Here's a yellow one.
What?
It might've traveled far.
You seem sad. Are you homesick?
No, I'm not.
Look, over there.
They're aircraft carriers. Maybe
it's the Hiyo and the Junyo.
They're so big.
Those little ones are
destroyers.
There's a U-boat from Germany.
That ship is a submarine tender.
Look, there's a white-eye.
Over there.
I can see.
Shusaku, what is that?
Is that a ship?
That's the Yamato,
the world's greatest warship,
born from the Orient's
greatest shipyard.
There's people on it, too?
Yes.
About 2,700 people.
Two thousand...
and seven hundred?
That's right.
Let's welcome them to Kure.
They cook for 2,700 people
on that boat every day?
- And do laundry?
- Hey, Suzu.
I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Yes.
Are you hurt?
Suzu, stress will only
make you lose more hair.
So you knew...
Can I borrow the ink brush?
I want to paint Suzu's head.
I said no!
You'll stain everything black.
Soon, Keiko left and went back
to her late husband's family,
so I thought--
All right! now it's my
turn to cook!
But by then, rationing
became much worse.
May 1944 "Sold Out: Next
Delivery Unknown"
Four dried sardines for three
meals for a family of four.
It's still better then just
being given vegetable leafs,
and maybe I can buy
some soy pulp.
I see.
Violets,
stellaria, field horsetail.
Dandelions, dried sardines,
and soy pulp.
Potatoes, sweet potatoes, flour
and pickled plum pits.
Cut and steam a sweet potato.
Boil and chop some
field horsetails.
Mix them with flour
and form a flat disk.
And lunch is ready!
It's so quiet without Keiko.
Dry the leftovers for
another day.
Moving on...
Use extra water for thin
rice porridge.
Add potatoes and let it simmer
for ten minutes.
Then add chopped stellaria.
Cook daikon rinds and dandelion
roots with soy sauce and sugar.
Add dandelion leaves and soy
pulp then let it simmer.
Finely slice and salt daikon,
then add yellow wood sorrel.
Boil pickled plum pits in water.
Add the dried sardines
and stew while basting.
Finish it off with salt.
Mrs. Kariya taught
you this recipe?
Rice rations were halved
so I made sweet potato porridge.
Good job.
I'll do better tomorrow.
The loyal samurai Kusunoki
devised
the "food increase
recipe" during a siege.
First, toast and
brown some rice.
Add triple the amount of water
and gently simmer the rice.
Saving rice and energy
must go hand in hand.
Leave it to the fireless stove
of the Great Empire of Japan!
Let it sit overnight.
Add miso and violets to
yesterday's sardine stew.
Reheat rice on the stove.
Samurai Kusunoki's special,
"Nanko Meshi" is served!
This one is for Father-in-law.
We have lots of rice today.
The grains are so puffy.
I've never seen rice
cooked this way.
- Yes.
- Let's eat.
- We're off.
- I'm so sorry.
Lord Kusunoki must have been
quite bold and remarkable
to enjoy meals like that.
Yes, I agree.
June 1944
Air raid warning!
Air raid alert!
There's nothing on the radio.
Is Shusaku off to work already?
Yes.
Estimates of the enemy's range
puts only Kyushu in
danger for now.
No need to run to the
mountains yet.
It's only a blackout.
Don't fall now.
They are removing buildings.
They need firebreaks.
I see.
Not around here, but
in the city.
That's terrible. I hope they can
find a place to live.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I have plenty of firewood.
My house was torn down.
Oh no.
The family will move
to Shimonoseki.
So I left my husband's family.
What?
Don't worry. I'll find
a job and work.
There will be more of us now.
Like this?
Yes!
July 1944
I heard them over Mt. Haigamine.
Big guns even up there?
Things are getting
more precarious.
Thank you for helping us.
What a fine bomb shelter.
It is.
So admirable of him to build
this shelter
even with
all that overtime.
The pillars and tatami mats from
Keiko's house were a godsend.
Shusaku. Did you
place this here?
It's nothing.
Let's clean up out here.
Can I have some of this
dirt for our field?
Sure, take it. Just be careful.
So this is where you've been.
Yes. I'm looking at ships.
There's a lot of ships today.
I see two Yamato ships.
One of them is Musashi.
I see lots of warships,
but no aircraft carriers.
I see.
That's the Tone. She has
no rear turrets.
She's an aircraft cruiser.
Really?
That's amazing. You know so much.
Yeah, he taught me.
I see. I also learned a
thing or two.
That's a destroyer.
I see small ones.
That's a motor launch.
I'll teach you something too.
Look at that big cloud.
It's an anvil cloud.
It causes heavy rain.
Shusaku!
Take everything into
the shelter.
Thanks.
No, I can do it.
So you like warships?
Did you teach Harumi
about warships?
I didn't teach Harumi.
Hi-bo taught her.
He?
Yeah, Hi-bo loves battleships.
You'll meet him one day.
Is his name Hisao, as
etched here?
Yes.
I can't believe I'm here,
doing this with him.
Good.
Let's go while it's
only a drizzle.
Father...
You're a married couple.
It's nice that you get along.
Isn't that nice. Two couples
getting along so well.
Keiko...
They used to measure their
heights together as a family.
Wait, did Keiko's husband...
He was too frail to be drafted.
I guess he was way too skinny...
When my father was rehired
by the Navy Arsenal,
Keiko went to buy a watch for
him, that's where they met.
"Kuromura Watchmaker"
They got married and
they renewed the store.
But Keiko, with her temper,
didn't get along
with his family.
When her husband died,
they fought over the business.
But in the end...
The building removal
took everything away.
Hisao is the heir
of the Kuromura family.
Her son was taken to
Shimonoseki.
Even for Keiko,
that was hard on her.
I wish we could all
live happily.
Me too...
I need to check on the garden.
It took several months for me
to find that out about her.
That's how
distracted I can be...
That's Yamato.
That's Tone.
Sir. I was... just...
"Military Police"
I just wanted to send
a drawing to my nephew...
Does this girl live here?
The military police?
She was sketching
shorelines and ships.
That's espionage!
She may look innocent,
but who knows what nefarious
plots she is scheming!
Her husband is a two-bit clerk
at the navy
court-martial office.
Has she attempted
to access military secrets?
Has she sent coded
transmissions?
Does she have a random
number table?
Is there anything suspicious
regarding her background? Well?
We will not arrest her today,
but keep a close eye on her.
After all, a daughter-in-law
was a stranger before!
I'm home.
The laundry is still outside.
Shusaku...
The military police
investigated Suzu and...
Suzu, come with me.
It's so small, you won't be able
to draw the shoreline.
Suzu, since you love to draw,
can you draw me sometime?
I don't know if I can
draw you well...
Suzu involved in espionage...?
Shusaku, you were lucky...
We couldn't be rude
to the MPs...
We had to hold back
our laughter.
Which only made it funnier.
This girl forgets everything
when she's focused on something.
Acting humble made her look
cunning and what not.
She's so clueless, she thought I
work as a store clerk.
Suzu a spy? Those Army
MPs are idiots!
I don't understand,
but it sounds funny!
I wish we could all
live happily.
Me too...
I'm home.
Dad's home! Let's tell him, too!
Am I the only one who
doesn't find it funny?
August 1944
Even in war,
cicadas cry and butterflies fly.
"Sugar rations end in August"
No more sugar?
We thought the war
would hit home soon
when all the air raids
happened in June...
Wonder where it is now?
Ouch.
I'm sorry, Harumi.
I'm okay. I was
looking at the ants.
I wonder where they're going...
Sugar is precious right now!
We need to hide it
from the ants.
But where?
What's wrong?
We thought putting it
in the water would keep
the ants from it.
Here, buy some at the
black market.
Roads I usually don't travel.
Eat up!
We're supposed to be low on
everything.
What are all these
people doing here?
What?
This is a fine rice from Taiwan.
I could get some Japanese rice,
too.
I thought we were not supposed
to grow watermelons now.
They have everything here.
It's like summer breaks
before the war.
Sugar is 20 yen.
That's fifty times the
ration price!
The price will only go up now.
With mother's money and this
month's budget,
I only have 25 yen.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...
"Buy or Not Buy"
Will sugar cost about 150
yen in the future?
A box of caramel could
cost more than 100 yen.
Maybe three pairs of socks
will cost 1,000 yen.
How will we survive in a country like that?
Wha...?
Where am I?
Naganoki? The naval cemetery?
Wait, that's Nagasako.
Isn't it over there?
It's that way.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Watermelon?
Yes.
Caramel?
Yes.
You're lost?
Yes.
Even though you're a grown-up?
Where did you come from?
Naganoki.
Miss, no one will give me
directions
and everyone
smells very nice.
Am I in a fairy tale palace?
For Naganoki,
you turn that corner and go down
to the post office...
Wait here.
Madam, I have a question.
Go straight and turn right
when you pass the post office.
Thank you so much.
People around here are not
well informed.
Most of us aren't locals and
we stay within these gates.
Are you also from South
Hiroshima? Near the ocean?
I am. But how did you...?
Your accent...
Are you from Eba?
From Kusatsu.
Kusatsu!
I had watermelon at my grandma's
every summer.
We were poor, so I always ate
the rinds people left behind.
I met a kind person once though,
so I finally could have the red flesh.
It was a long time ago.
You draw very well.
Looking at them... can you...
Sure! I'll draw
whatever you want.
Mint candy and bracken dumpling!
Mint candy.
And ice cream with
wafers on top.
Wafer?
What? You've never
been to a cafe?
Rin!
Stop playing around so much.
Sorry, I have to go.
I'll come back another time
with more drawings.
Don't.
You shouldn't come back here.
You'll get lost again.
What took you so long?
Did you get lost or something?
Keiko, what is an ice cream with
wafers in a cafe?
You don't know?
Well. It's sweet and cold.
You eat it with a
crispy cracker.
Ah, wonderful...
Wait...
Thinking about desserts
makes water taste sweet.
September 1944
It's still very hot.
Mrs. Houjo,
you got a phone call.
Yes? A phone call for me?
Ah, this is what he wants.
The heat is not letting up.
You'll embarrass Shusaku
dressed like that!
Still some time,
let's take a walk.
How goes it with the GKF?
Things are quite laid back.
Good! Let's have a cold beer, then.
"Kure Navy Court-Martial Office"
Shusaku, I've brought
your notebook.
What?
Suzu? You're very pale,
are you okay?
I guess I look funny, right?
No. I'm happy if you're okay.
Let's go then.
Go? What about work?
I used the excuse that
you needed to bring me
that notebook.
You had fun shopping in
the city, right?
What's the matter? Are you ill?
I don't want you seeing me
smiling ear to ear!
I wanted to take you to
the cinema, but...
I guess a big ship is
back in port.
Sailors need their break.
We'll go another time.
Suzu?
A classmate of mine from
elementary school
became a sailor.
What if I bump into him?
Then you just say hi.
I might wake from this dream
if I met someone from my past.
Dream?
Changing my name and
moving was hard for me,
but you're so kind to me.
And I've made friends.
I don't want to wake up because
I'm happy to be who I am today.
I see.
The past and the paths we did
not choose,
they're like a dream.
Suzu, choosing to marry you,
was the best
decision of my life.
I'm worried that
you've lost weight.
I suppose I've lost my
appetite lately.
Here. Eat for two people!
"Clinic"
You had a lot for breakfast.
This should be enough.
Eating for only one after all.
Ready port entry. Slow ahead.
Reduce 2 knots.
December 1944
Aye, sir. Slow ahead.
Reduce 2 knots.
Aye-aye, sir.
I'll go ask for you.
Thanks.
Hello?
A real sailor!
We bumped into each
other at the well.
I'm Tetsu Mizuhara, an
Aoba crewmember.
Isn't Aoba a Class A cruiser?
Stop, Harumi.
You're tanned even in winter.
So you're here to take a bath?
"Bath shore leave"
means free time,
and I had nowhere to go.
So I thought of Suzu,
a friend from back home.
Thank you for taking
care of Suzu.
Suzu was only good at drawing
and making seaweed.
She must be quite useless here.
I'll take her off your
hands anytime!
Stop being so cocky!
And don't call me by my first name!
What? I can't call you
Urano anymore.
What?
Suzu, you can't hit a sailor.
What's so funny?
You. You're so normal.
This is delicious!
It's nothing special.
This is heaven.
Suzu, come join me!
Are you crazy?
Suzu, where's the lamp?
I think it's in the shelter.
Right...
I'm gonna be a sailor
when I grow up.
That's great.
Thank you.
What do you say?
Good night.
Good night.
There's nothing like
being on dry land.
I'm going to bed.
How is Aoba?
We came back from
Manila with the wounded.
It's a great ship,
but it's without victory
or defeat, again.
Feeling left behind, alive,
while others have
already died...
Makes me feel anxious...
Mr. Mizuhara, with my father
away on duty,
I'm the head of this family.
I'm sorry, but I can't let you
sleep in this house.
What?
I asked him to sleep in
the storeroom.
That was quite a sight.
I can't remember ever seeing you
being so assertive.
I readied the bed warmer.
Take it to him.
Talk to him. It may be the
last time you see him.
I'm sorry about the room.
It's heaven compared
to a hammock.
We have lots to
talk about. Come.
Okay.
Here. This is for you.
Really?
Are you making a pen?
There...
It works.
It looked like a heron,
but I saw it in the South.
I didn't know they migrated.
Me neither.
Back in Eba,
they just stood in the river.
There were lots in Eba.
No, I can't draw it very well.
That's hard to believe.
Wait. You haven't
drawn in a while?
Well...
That drawing of white
rabbit waves...
Yes, I remember.
It caused a lot of trouble.
Really?
You forgot?
Our teacher entered it
into a contest.
Everyone loved that drawing,
and I didn't know what to do.
They all thought I drew it,
when actually the real artist...
Was you.
Suzu, you are so warm,
Suzu, you are so soft,
and sweet.
Mizuhara...
I've been waiting for
this moment forever.
You coming for me...
You finally being here...
But I...
I'm so angry at him! It
boils my blood!
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I understand.
You love him.
I do.
You're surprisingly normal.
I'm sorry.
You still get angry and
apologize for ordinary things.
You want to stay?
I thought you were forced to get
married and needed help.
No...
Then it's all good.
Is he four years older?
Shusaku?
He's the same age as my brother.
Our family was poor, so he chose
a tuition-free naval academy.
But when my brother died,
I signed up to join the Navy.
They were ordinary choices,
but somewhere along the way,
I derailed from the ordinary.
That's why...
I'm relieved to see that
you haven't changed.
So don't revere me
when I'm gone.
Smile when you think of me.
I want you to stay ordinary and
sane in this world
until the end.
Suzu.
You're beautiful.
You idiot!
Since childhood,
I've never been able to tell you
how I really feel.
"Tetsu, thank you for
staying alive."
"Army Private First
Class Yoichi Urano"
February 1945
Welcome home.
They sent us a single rock
instead of his bones.
This perplexed Sumi, so...
Is this Yoichi's brain?
Was her guess.
What was he like?
They called us up in the
cold for this?
There's no way Yoichi is dead.
People are gone just like that.
Our voices can't reach
those no longer with us.
Shusaku.
I wanted to thank you.
For giving me the time
to talk to Mizuhara.
It's nothing.
But doesn't marriage
mean more to you?
I forced you to marry me.
And yet you've never shown
your angry face to me.
I'm showing it to you now.
Oh, so now you're mad?
You need to pay attention!
Oh yeah?
Why did you have to wear
socks with holes today?
The one you sewed
last night were too tight.
Wear something else!
Could you sort out
that argument at home?
You're going the
wrong way again.
I know.
Our house is toward Mt.
Haigamine.
I said, I know!
It snowed a lot that winter.
I couldn't wait for
spring to come.
More vivid than indigo
March 19th, 1945
The big blue sky
Opens right up
With white roses
adorning everywhere
Like wallpaper,
going on forever.
Don't worry.
No teacher will scold a
well-behaved child like you.
Really? School isn't scary?
It's not. You'll make friends,
too.
I didn't know anyone here at
first,
but now everyone
is my friend.
My mommy, too?
Well...
What?
Watch your head!
Harumi!
If only I had paint and
paper with me...
Damn it, what am I thinking!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Stand back! Take cover!
Welcome home!
That air raid alert is way too
late. Watch out for shrapnel.
Ouch!
Can you hear that?
Our 2,000 horsepower engines
sound wonderful.
That's why we work day and night
at the factory,
to improve their efficiency.
We've come a long way from the
Type 91500 horsepower engines.
We strive to improve our skills,
a light of hope for world peace.
A unified
determination and goal...
What about their engines?
What's their horsepower?
Mr. Houjo?
Air raid all clear!
I know you worked all night,
but how could you fall
asleep during an air raid?
There, there.
I was so scared.
We caught many fish in
Kure that day.
It's tiny.
It'll be big if you
draw it bigger.
04:50 hours, March 29th, 1945
Air raid alert! Ready
air raid gear!
Put out all fires! Remove
sliding doors!
Grab survival kits and
head to bomb shelters!
Air raid alarm all clear.
It's still raw...
Poor Mrs. Kariya,
March 31st, 1945
She lost her husband in the war.
Now her 17-year-old is
being drafted.
Congratulations...
22:10 hours, April 1st
Ready air raid gear!
Remove sliding doors!
Survival kits...
I can't see anything.
Oops! Sorry!
Whose cat is that?
23:45 hours, April 5th
I'm tired of sirens.
Never seen that before...
April 6th, 1945
17 large enemy aircraft
currently above Mt. Tsuburayama.
May 5th, 1945
Engagement ongoing. 30 aircraft
approaching from southeast.
Heading towards Kure.
Air raid alarm all clear.
May 5th morning -- Air raid. 125
large enemy aircraft attacked.
Damage to Hiro Naval Arsenal
and Air Arsenal No. 11
was very limited.
I'm home.
Good. You're safe, Shusaku.
Where's Father?
- Not home... yet.
- I see.
Suzu, it's boiling over.
You're so small.
You're small even
when you stand.
What is it?
Nothing, You're small.
That's all.
Your father will come
home safely.
My military uniform arrived.
What?
It's wrapped up there.
From the 15th,
I'll be a Chief Petty Officer.
I'll go to Navy training and
won't be back for 3 months.
Will you come back
after training?
I think so.
But you'll be okay, Suzu.
You're small,
but you can protect this house
all on your own.
I can't! That's impossible.
I'm sorry. I lied.
I'm so fond of you.
But I might forget your face
after 3 months without you.
Suzu...
That's why I'll wait
for you here.
Because I don't know
if I could find you otherwise.
Sunday, May 6th
Tuesday, May 8th
May 10th: One air-raid alert.
May 11th: Two alerts.
May 12th: No warnings.
May 13th: Three air raid
warnings only.
May 14th
Will you not forget me if you draw me?
It was a figure of speech.
With you, it's possible.
Let me see. Am I handsome?
I can't show you.
It's top secret!
May 15th
I'm off.
Take care.
I'll walk you half way.
Thanks.
Military uniforms are so handsome!
The house suddenly feels larger.
June 21st
For the Houjo's.
I thought he would've been
admitted to a hospital nearby.
No wonder we couldn't find him.
He's hurt but he'll be
discharged soon.
Dad asked me to
repair his watch.
It's a good chance to visit
the Kuromura family tomorrow.
Where my brother is?
I'll get ready.
Can I come?
- What about school?
- Don't worry.
All you do is dig stuff
and physical training.
The hands of girls
can also work for our country.
We are all...
This will take forever.
I'll get the tickets.
Can you take Harumi to Dad?
All right. Let's go.
Can we visit the Navy?
Sure.
Don't worry.
Push comes to shove,
use your bamboo spear!
You idiot! I'm not scared
of ex-in-laws!
You seemed worried so...
Bamboo spears won't be
useful anyhow.
Is Shimonoseki far?
Yes.
Farther than Hiroshima?
Way farther.
Over there?
You have to stay quiet okay?
Is this enemy's music?
I'm sorry I got you worried.
I've been unconscious.
I hear it's June already.
I'm glad you're alive.
We're gonna ride the train
and see my brother.
Is that so? The
sooner the better.
What ship were you in?
Auxiliary minesweeper No.16.
I've heard many things here.
Hiro Arsenal closed down
and there are rumors that we'll
be merged with the Army.
Did you know that Yamato sunk?
Yamato?
Backed into a corner, she went
out with her guns blazing.
The Seto Inland Sea is
no longer ours.
Which means the white
rabbit are...
- What?
- Nothing.
That's why I suggested,
that Harumi should go live
with the Kuromuras. It's safer.
So that's why Keiko was...
Suzu, can we go over there?
I want to tell my brother
which ships I saw here.
Not sure if we can see
them from there.
Just a peek!
We can't see anything.
What should we do?
Can't go home...
Need to find a public
bomb shelter.
Are they really coming?
We've had series of
false alarms.
0923 hours, enemy aircraft
sighted southeast of Tokuyama.
About 20 large aircraft
heading to Kure
They're coming,
Can you let us in?
Come quickly.
Evacuate! Run!
I'm scared.
We'll be okay. Look.
That's Mommy.
And who's this?
Me...
Your mommy is always with you.
You're not from around here,
right?
We're visiting from Naganoki.
Bad luck, huh?
Cover your ears! Open your
mouth!
Or else your
eyes will pop out!
It's so hot...
Hang on...
Excuse me. Can we
have some water?
Thank you very much.
Did we miss the train?
Maybe the train is
waiting for people.
Okay.
I can't see.
Are you all right?
We're fine!
Dud bombs may actually
have delayed fuses.
Evacuate now!
Yes! Thank you for
your hard work!
Hey Suzu?
Will you draw my
brother some time?
Craters of unexploded
bombs are small...
According to latest reports,
the enemy uses these bombs...
Watch out, Harumi!
Not again, not like that!
No one will marry you
if you don't do it right.
She warned me many times,
but somehow I did marry...
Watermelon.
Bracken-dumplings.
Mint candy.
I wish there had been a ditch
to jump into.
I held my bag with my left hand.
I held Harumi with
my right hand.
If only I had it the
other way around.
If I had at least run barefoot,
We may have made it over the
hill... What was there anyway?
That's the Tone and that's the Hyuga.
Look, Mommy. It's the Yamato.
She...
She looks so much like Shusaku.
You were there with her.
How could you let this happen?
I'm so sorry, Harumi.
I'm so sorry, Keiko.
Murderer.
You killed her!
- Give her back.
- Stop, Keiko!
It's time for the tofu rations.
She's not herself right now.
She didn't mean what she said.
We're glad at least
you survived.
Really?
You can't lose your place
in this world so easily.
Rin?
Where was my place in
that moment?
Those fences should've
had some gaps.
If we had jumped through...
To the other side, to
the other side...
June 28th
Not again.
Ignore the siren.
They won't come.
This house survived just fine?
Yes. Don't worry.
I'm glad.
I lied.
I wonder...
Was it easier for her to leave?
With her house all destroyed.
Don't strain yourself.
July 1st
I'll take a break at
work if necessary.
Be safe.
The sun is out.
I'll hang the bandages to dry.
23:50. Chugoku air raid
information.
Enemy aircraft in Hiroshima Bay.
Can you get up?
Yes.
23:58 hours. Enemy aircraft
circling Kure and Hiroshima.
23:58 hours. Enemy aircraft
circling Kure and Hiroshima.
There's so many of them,
but can't see anything.
Are those parachute flares?
Hurry, Suzu!
Eighth squad, move!
Suzu, what are you doing? Hurry!
Suzu? Suzu?
One dropped here?
Water! We need more water!
Okay.
Ready...
Be careful.
A formation is northbound
via Hiroshima Bay.
Another northbound via
Bungo Channel.
Three are confirmed
in the seas south of Ashizuri.
This is JOFK, Hiroshima
Broadcasting.
Hang on, people of Kure!
Persevere, people of Kure!
Anyone suffering hardship...
Please grab rice balls
delivered from Hiroshima!
Come get them at Nikou Park.
Where can I file a
damage report?
Is City Hall still standing?
My house burned down.
Avoiding the shelter saved us.
May I?
Yes. Go ahead.
Eat one while it's still warm.
It cooked well as my house
burned down.
Thank you.
Keiko...?
I've had enough of this heat.
Is there anyone from Shinonome?
The red-light district
burned to the ground.
I see.
Suzu!
You're hurt.
- Your training?
- Cancelled.
I'm glad that you're alive.
As I faded away...
Suzu!
I heard myself say, "Find Rin."
I'm glad, anyhow...
I'm glad you're feeling better.
I'm glad it was a dud.
I'm glad it was put out.
I'm glad you're getting better.
I'm glad.
I'm glad... I'm glad...
I don't know what
I should be glad about.
My right hand that held
Harumi's hand in June.
My right hand that drew
Shusaku's face in May.
My right hand that held
Teru's lip balm in April.
My right hand that held
my brother's brain in February.
My right hand that failed to
pattern
Keiko's kimono
last November.
My right hand that drew
candy for Rin last August.
My right hand that cooked Lord
Kusunoki's rice...
My right hand that drew...
My right hand that drew
my hometown last February.
My hand that loved to cook...
My right hand that drew
many rabbits seven years ago.
Your sister is here!
What a disaster, Suzu.
Sumi, thanks for coming.
The army officer gave me
a lift on the relief truck.
What is that?
It's not new, but it's
pure cotton.
Not rayon?
No, so it's strong.
Thank you.
These are loquats from Mt. Eba.
Are you sure?
I need to exercise.
Let me walk you half-way.
I'm meeting him at the
fire station.
It's near the scaffold
by the river,
or did that burn down, too?
It's still there. The army
officer showed it to me.
He's young but very kind.
He's been giving me his meal
tickets and other things.
He remembered that I have
a sister who moved to Kure.
You like him?
Oh please, Suzu.
Ouch.
This is horrible.
It's so sad that Kure
keeps being targeted.
You must find it hard to be here
not being able to do housework.
Suzu, why don't you
come home to Hiroshima?
The bombings aren't as bad.
With our brother gone,
no one will pick on you.
I suppose...
I know. I'll come back if your
officer friend is handsome.
Why, that's so improper!
I'm kidding! See you again!
Something is distorted...
It'd be great if you came.
Come home for the
festival next month.
Thanks, Sumi.
I was glad my brother was dead.
I'm distorted, like a drawing
using my left hand.
"Record of air raid alerts:
July 3rd to 12th"
"July 13th to 16th"

"July 27th "
07:00 hours, July 28th
Here we go again.
It's going to be a long day.
Pack everything.
Suzu, come!
Don't come here.
You can't be here.
Yes! Fly away as far as you can,
over the mountain, to Hiroshima!
Do you want to die?
I'm sorry. I saw a white heron flying.
Oh, it fled from the beach.
Shusaku, I'm going home
to Hiroshima.
You intend to stay there?
Is this about your hand?
The air raids?
Harumi?
Yes, it's all of those things.
I can't hear you.
It's none of that!
Tell me why, then!
Suzu, I really enjoyed these
18 months we've spent together.
I loved coming home to you,
I loved walking with you
and listening to you talk.
You don't feel the same?
Am I still a stranger to you?
I can't hear you.
I can't hear a thing,
I'm going home to Hiroshima!
Fine.
Do as you please!
No enemy aircraft over the
Chugoku military district.
Nine days later
07:31 hours,
Hiroshima Prefecture.
Air raid warning lifted.
Great timing.
We're off.
Take care.
Ouch.
That's the spot.
What a hot morning.
We're going to miss you, Suzu.
So what time is your
doctor's appointment?
About 10 o'clock.
You need to change.
Here.
Excuse me...
I guess we won't need
to wash this.
Isn't your hometown's
festival today?
Yes. I was going to
go home last weekend,
but I couldn't get
an appointment until today.
Don't look!
I'm sorry.
You'll never make it today.
Doctors are busy too, you know.
You'll need a referral as well.
Train tickets are usually sold
out anyway.
Here, I've fixed your
sister's kimono.
I added rubber straps so you can
wear it easily.
They're all I
could scrap together.
Thank you very much...
I'm sorry I blamed you
for Harumi's death.
It's okay.
"Kuromura Clockwork"
The man I loved died young.
My shop was destroyed.
I can't see my children anymore.
But my own choices led me here.
You had no choice, though.
You were brought here.
You did what you were told.
What a boring life this
must've been.
You're welcome to stay here
or go anywhere you choose.
Stop worrying and
choose for yourself.
Keiko. Did you see that flash?
I did!
Could it be lightning
in this weather?
I... changed my mind...
Can you wash this, please?
And please, would you
let me stay?
Yes, now let me go. It's
too hot for that!
What was that?
The JOFK isn't coming in.
The other stations?
Hey!
Come over here and look.
What is that cloud?
Cloud?
Look at that big cloud.
It's an anvil cloud.
This is Okayama Broadcasting.
Hiroshima, do you read me?
I found a flyer from all the way
from Hiroshima on the street.
Anyone available, please come to
the settlement house.
Chita, aren't you a nurse?
Yes, but I've never
made sandals.
No one around here has.
Is this okay?
It's frustrating with one hand.
Now you're just gloating...
What are these sandals for?
They're for Hiroshima.
That flash melted the roads so
shoes are no good.
Can I come too?
The wounded must stay.
My son is a soldier
in Hiroshima.
You can join us tomorrow.
Hiroshima helped us before,
now it's our turn to help them.
My hair won't get in the way
now. Take me, please.
I said no!
Silly girl. I'll trim your hair
when we get home.
My husband is going to
Hiroshima soon.
I hear it was a new
type of bomb.
Oh no.
Suzu, your family...
Mum!
The navy base sent a
relief party.
You came from Hiroshima, too?
He died sitting here.
He walked all the way
from Hiroshima.
But we couldn't tell
who he was...
Because his face and
clothes had melted...
Let's not tell Mrs. Houjo.
I can't face her. I feel so bad.
I picked eucalyptus leaves
to keep mosquitoes away.
Thank you. Stay strong, okay?
I will. Their names are, Juro,
Kiseno and Sumi Urano.
Understood.
And also Ito, Marina and Chizuko
Morita.
I want to stay strong.
Kind but strong.
Like the people of Kure.
Ah, this rubbish again...
We'll never surrender
to violence.
August 9th
Please let me stay.
Forever.
You had me worried. You dummy.
Dummy, dummy...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I missed all of them.
I'd never hear the end of it
if the Navy knew...
Suzu, this is US propaganda.
It should be handed to
the authorities.
They'll burn it anyway.
So I gather them
to use them as toilet paper.
I see, then we can't let people
use our toilet for a while.
Our battle is to survive
with whatever we have.
I suppose.
Please, come in.
August 15th
Hello.
We are keenly aware of the
innermost feelings of all of you,
Our subjects. However, it is
according to the dictates of
time and fate that
We have resolved to pave the
way for a grand peace
for all the generations to come
by enduring the unendurable and
suffering what is insufferable.
Thus ends the His Majesty the
Emperor's honorable broadcast.
Oh well. It's finally over.
So, this means...
We lost the war?
Why?
They dropped those new bombs
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The Soviets have declared war.
We couldn't possibly win.
They knew what we were getting
into, didn't they?
They said we would
fight to the end!
There's five of us still here!
I still have my left arm
and both legs.
Harumi.
Harumi...
Everything we've
done slips away.
Everything we've come
to terms with.
The reasons why we've
endured it all.
Rice and soybeans grown overseas,
that's what my body is made of.
So we surrender to violence?
If only I could stay distracted
and oblivious until I die.
I stocked this for
our last meal.
So let's enjoy white
rice tonight.
But not all of it.
There's still a tomorrow
and the day after that.
August 15th and 16th...
and 17th.
September.
October, November and next year.
A year later, 10 years later.
Forever and ever.
Look, it's a glorious white!
We only have rice.
Not to worry. Where's Shusaku?
Not home, yet.
I suppose it's the
legal office's job
to keep order in
times like this.
Let's start eating.
No more bombs, so no more
floating fish.
I remember that time, yes.
What are we doing? I can't see
my beautiful white rice.
October 6th
They'll be landing soon.
I'll be stationed in Ootake.
As long as our navy stands, it's
our obligation to keep order.
In times like this...
I wish I had both hands, so I
could hold his to comfort him.
It's so quiet.
Everything's ready.
Thank you. Here is fine.
Go back home quickly.
Goodbye.
I'll be back! I'll
come home to you!
Yes!
"Rice rations postponed"
We haven't had salt or
soy sauce for quite a while.
November 1945
Keiko!
Hi Suzu, do you know
what this queue is for?
No idea, but I'll take
anything gladly.
We're short on everything.
Well, that's true.
The city has changed.
I wonder if Hisao begs for chocolate too.
Would Harumi have done the same?
It's leftovers of the
occupation army.
Paper waste?
So... delicious!
This one's flavorless.
I gave the Americans directions
and they gave me chocolate.
With that hair style,
they thought you were a child.
You exchanged so many clothes.
It's all right.
Didn't you hear?
The dead soldier found next to
the settlement house was my son.
I couldn't recognize my own son.
You lost Harumi in
front of your eyes.
Yes. It was awful.
Suzu.
Suzu.
Smile, when you think of me.
I want you to stay
ordinary and sane.
Suzu.
Harumi. I can see the ship now.
It's the Aoba.
Tetsu, I just saw it in
your smile...
The sea with white rabbits,
the sky with white herons...
Harumi always laughed, so I'll
laugh whenever I think of her.
From now on, this body will
be here to smile.
That's right. It'd be a waste
to cry all the time.
It's a waste of salt.
Thank heavens for
the salty seas!
Grandma! Auntie! Chizuko!
January 1946
Suzu!
Sumi?
Suzu! You cut your hair.
Don't get up. Are you ill?
I'm a little dizzy.
What a shame big sister.
I can't help with work outside
on this cold bitter day.
I suppose you must rest
easy for now.
If only I had my hand,
I'd draw "Yoichi's Adventures
in the South Seas."
What would the story be about?
Yoichi's troop transport
gets shipwrecked.
So he builds a house
with palm leaves on an island.
He grows a beard and
marries a crocodile.
A crocodile for a bride.
I wish Yoichi could
come back to Eba.
And Mom, too.
What?
On the morning of the festival,
Mom went shopping in the city.
Dad and I looked everywhere,
but couldn't find her.
Dad fell ill in October
and died soon after.
He was cremated along with
others at school.
I should have told you sooner.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I couldn't
come sooner.
I'm glad you didn't.
Suzu, look at me.
Will I get better?
Yes, of course you will!
Sachiko!
Sorry.
Kiyoko! Aren't you Kiyoko?
Everyone lost someone,
and they're still looking.
I think I saw Rin a few times,
too.
Suzu.
You're back.
The Navy was disbanded
at the end of November.
I've been let go.
Suzu, this is the bridge
where I first met you.
We can't go back in time.
We'll keep changing,
this city and us.
But I will always
tell you apart.
I'll find this beauty
mark right away.
Thank you, for finding me
in this Corner of the World.
Please never leave, and
always be by my side.
Huh?
- Oh...
- Let it be.
I'm glad I found a job
in Hiroshima.
Me, too.
The commute will be difficult.
I... what?
Thank you. But you can have it.
We could leave Kure
and start over here.
For your family's sake.
No, I can commute.
I'm worried about Hiroshima
but Kure is the town I
chose to live in.
Oh?
It's okay.
Next stop, Kure.
Kure?
That's right. This is Kure.
"Kure" means we are
protected by nine mountains.
On your right is Mt. Yasumi,
to the left is Mt. Hachimaki.
And in the center is Mt.
Haigamine.
That's where our home is.
This child...
She's covered in lice!
Hurry, we have to boil all
of our clothes!
We should start with a bath.
She should go in last.
I'll start the fire.
I wonder if Harumi's clothes
would be too small.
