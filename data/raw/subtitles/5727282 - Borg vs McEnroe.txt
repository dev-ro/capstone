Let me try.
Good!
Stop filming, Stop!
Are you playing in the Davis Cup?
Or is it Wimbledon? Björn?
- Are you in the final?
- Yes.
Is the competition fierce?
It's Björn!
- An autograph, please?
- Please...
- Are you selling them?
Björn! Björn! Björn Borg!
What’s up?
Are you being chased?
A coffee please.
"A coffee?"
- "Coffee."
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.
But you can help me out
if you want.
Right there thanks.
What do you do?
- Are you an electrician?
- Yes.
If you are an electrician,
I am Prince Albert.
Thank you.
Do you like working as an electrician?
Where have you been?
I was worried.
I went for a walk.
- Is something wrong?
- No, I just lost track of time.
Did you pack?
Of course.
Can you get the fifth title?
Welcome, Everything Ok?
Tomorrow and Wednesday will rain,
but not today.
This is not our usual car.
- Of course it is. They know what we want.
- The Upholstery is different.
Shit!
I'll call them tomorrow.
Do not worry,
you will regain confidence.
I thought it was a private training session!
Tell that to security
who are over there.
You'll be fine.
Concentrate.
How does it feel to receive a telegram
from the King to wish you Good luck?
Good luck wishes
are always friendly.
We have to fine-tune the rackets, Björn.
Go on, I'll be right there.
What do you think?
- Björn? What do you think?
- What is the problem?
They are planning our life ...
"Did you not hear what they said?"
- Yes, but I want to know what you want.
Do you want to play in Africa?
Do you want to "sell" our marriage?
-I can’t think about it now.
-It is now we have to decide.
I can’t think about it now.
Right, sure ...
We have advertising campaigns ...
Björn, if our marriage makes you nervous
we can postpone it.
No, no problem.
We can arrange something simple.
- Yes.
As long as it’s something you want.
So we can’t decide?
Go to bed.
I'll sort out the rest.
What is up?
No one will remember that I won
4 consecutive Wimbledon titles ...
"Just that I lost the fifth time."
- What matters more you think?
They're all waiting ...
Waiting for me to lose.
- Fuck everybody!
Give everything you have tomorrow, even
If it seems to be your last game.
It's all here, Björn.
Here inside.
-Game Olsson.
-Olsson leads 4-2 in the second set.
- Out!
"No. It was on the line."
No it was out!
Wake up!
"What did you say, Borg?"
- I know it was out!
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
Warning, Borg.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
Punishment: Borg 0-15.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
Punishment: Borg 0-30.
Who is that?
- It's Borg from Södertälje.
- There's a lot of anger.
Yes, but little judgment.
His local club does not know what to do.
The Kid's a problem.
Look at that backhand!
With both hands!
He thinks he's hitting
with a taco?
-Listen ...
-You will win the next one.
Björn?
There is no better way
to solve this?
"Björn will not cause you any more trouble."
- Promise.
Mrs. Borg, it's important.
to set an example.
- 6 months suspension is an exaggeration.
"We have received many phone calls.
Phone calls from Halmstad,
Falköping and Stockholm.
From the parents of the other players.
They are upset. They do not want their
Children associated with Björn.
Tennis is not like football or
hockey, where only winning matters.
In tennis, the way you win
is also important.
It's a sport for gentlemen.
Let's be honest ...
Tennis is not an adequate sport
for all social classes.
What goes on in that head,
when you play?
Look at me,
when I talk to you
Don’t know.
- We'll have to sell your racket.
- Rune, please ...
None of the other kids
cause a scene.
Shut up!
Kid! I'm going to turn off the lights.
- You want a cinnamon bun?
"I do not have any money."
- I’ll pay, You deserve it. Two please.
Do you also play hockey?
That explains your left.
- Looks like a high-top shot.
- Yes, it gives more strength.
Exactly.
They say you're almost as good
at hockey, as you are in tennis.
Maybe it's more appropriate
for me.
Who said that?
You know I'm the captain of
the Davis Cup Swedish team.
Did you know?
- Yes.
It's part of my job
to discover new talent.
Few get suspended
for unsportsmanlike conduct.
They say you're not focused, in your mind.
Did they tell you that, too?
You think that's true?
It is not.
Who says that? They think they know
what I need ...
Do you think they played
on Centre Court, Wimbledon?
- No.
- Only I played.
I reached the quarter finals three times
In 1946, 1948 and 1951.
I know.
Percy Rosberg and I would like
you to come and train in Stockholm.
- How does that sound?
- Good.
One more thing, Björn ...
Do not listen to what they say.
What do you want from tennis?
To be the best.
- The best in Sweden?
- No. In the world.
Can you imagine me doing anything else ...
besides playing tennis?
Yes.
Do you?
Do not over think.
It’s simple. He has a strong serve,
but that's it.
This is it ...
Play your style of tennis.
He seems like he’s not concentrating.
No. It's the opposite.
Watch ...
30-0.
- This is crap!
- Calm!
15-0 to Bengtson.
Out.
Björn!
Enough for today.
Thank you.
- Why are you always doing this?
- What?
Swinging in the air like this,
after you fail?
Instead, concentrate
on the next hit.
Are you listening to me?
Lennart, come past my office later?
- We have to talk about Borg.
- What about him?
We are in the group to compete
against New Zealand?
No way!
- Why?
- He's only 15 years old.
- You think he's no good?
- He's different.
"We should not pressure him.
- This has a lot of advertising potential.
If a player, only 15 years old
against Onny Parun
the whole world will freak.
It does not matter if he loses.
The youngest player ever to
play Davis Cup.
- We're talking about a kid.
- He’s only 15 years old.
I refuse to put a player who is 15 years old
against a player who is rank 20 in the world.
- I will not.
- Then I'll have to find someone else who will.
- I can't do this.
- Calm down.
- Can we make them cancel the game?
- Reschedule?
It's Centre Court.
Sold out.
Björn...
- Go talk to them.
- What?
Speak with them.
- Björn...
- Speak with them!
It stopped raining.
They will not cancel.
Use this.
There is moisture.
Did you talk to them?
You know I didn’t.
Björn...
It would have made no difference
It’s all in your head.
- Out!
- It was in!
Out! Continue!
- You want him to win!
- Continue.
- Out.
- What the hell is going on?
Out! Continue!
- Out. Beat him!
- Come on!
- Pick up your racket!
- No! Never! You're cheating!
- Cheating?
"Go to hell, you faggot!"
I told you, get your racket!
Are you reaching
your maximum form.
Is it that difficult to string the rackets?
No, There's nothing wrong
with the rackets.
"I know when the strings are fine.
"That's not the problem, and you know it.
All those friendly games
and the tricks regarding sponsors ...
Just play tennis,
You look good.
- Shut up.
- What?
I said shut up and just tighten the strings.
You have to do this.
"If I'm slack, then I’ll quit."
- Ok!
- Are you serious?
- Very serious.
"He does not mean it."
- I'm serious!
Björn!
- What are you going to do now?
- What are you going to do?
Talk about your three
bad quarter finals?
Björn, please...
You will defeat him.
How do you know that?
I know and that's it.
Nobody can know that.
I might explode
in my next game.
They all think that this is easy.
Go there and win. You're a star!
You will defeat him. "Very easy.
"It's not easy for either of us.
- When's your big game?
If it is so difficult for you,
go away.
- Björn...
- Go.
Leave me, too.
 Do not think!
 Do not think!
I know how you feel, don’t worry
Sometimes I lost on purpose
just to get away
that horrible feeling,
trying to get away, to escape
When I lost, I went straight to the spa.
to vomit.
I could not bear to lose.
It's the same with you.
For you it’s life or death.
The other boys
do not feel the same.
They are not like you. That's why they will
be never as good as you can be.
But wishing so much,
it can also destroy you.
Three quarter-finals in Wimbledon ...
No other Swede could achieve.
In 1948, I could have won
that trophy.
Then I lost the first set.
And the second...
I could not control
my mind.
I should have switched off,
but I did not.
This Saturday, I will let you play
Onny Parun,
Only on one condition.
"I'm not going to apologize.
You do not have to ask.
But you have to promise me
one thing...
Where's Björn?
Promise me that you will never return
to show a single emotion.
Focus in your mind
and block out everything else
They do not exist.
All that anger,
The fear, the panic you feel
Inside your body,
unloads on each move,
Forehand shots, Backhand shots,
Each stroke.
Do you understand?
In Saturday's game there will be 5 sets.
It will be a single point.
One point at a time.
One point at a time, Björn.
But if you lose focus
and begin to show emotion,
It will be the end of the game.
Very well.
Here inside...
Björn Borg, after defeating
Onny Parun, you're conquering the world.
You're a heartbreaker and the girls
are in love with you.
Has this been a problem?
- Maybe a little...
The tennis world has never seen
nothing like this!
But, Björn, what happens
if you stop winning?
This will never happen.
Are you going to get tired of all
the hustle and bustle?
- No.
Or to repeat this battle of will
and nerves, day after day? 
No.
- Do you want this?
- Yes. 
- Is this your life?
- Yes, this is my life.
Concentrate!
- He sent you away?
- No, he’s asleep."
What are you writing?
Poetry?
A book.
My wedding gift
for Björn.
I was going to have a drink.
You need it, too.
First time I’ve seen him in a hotel room,
without a tennis racket.
Remember my first
meeting with Björn?
He saw you play
at the French Open.
He called me from the hotel room.
It looked like I was reading ...
a script out loud.
He invited me out and ...
I hoped it was just the two of us,
but you were there to.
He was so nervous.
It was fun.
When did we stop having fun?
They've been running out of it for five years.
There is no middle ground for Björn.
A 2nd or 3rd place is the same
than 12th or 1012th. It's the same for him.
When he starts to lose ...
It's over.
Just in the car, it seemed
I had given up on him. 
He fired me.
But he does not want me to be around,
when all fails.
Mr. Borg?
Mr. Borg?
We arrived.
Where are we?
Pleased to meet you. I'm Silvana Ruíz
from Argentina Television.
Björn.
Let's start by saying
who is the best tennis player in the world?
Winner of Wimbledon 4 times
and is in search of the fifth title.
I could play against the door of a garage,
how did he do when he was a kid?
I do not remember which door it was.
It's very important!
I have to think.
Please, Mr. Borg.
You won twice this afternoon</ i>
in Wimbledon. How do you feel?</ I>
 I feel good.
Go away, Labbe.
Breathe.
Let's finish this together.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You're acting like ...
You're acting like a child.
Treating people
who like you as trash.
Go out there,
Lower your head and you will lose.
Is that what you want?
Stop it all?
So give him an easy win.
Say you hurt a muscle.
"Or admit that your nerves ... "
- Stop! Stop!
You know what you're doing.
No need.
Everything I've done,
led me to this moment.
One last match.
One point at a time.
Correct.
It's almost time
The Wimbledon final ...
The whole world waits
for these two giants to enter ...
like two gladiators.
Here comes Björn. The Swedish people 
are cheering for him.
McEnroe arrives at the net
at lightning speed.
Borg is getting destroyed
by McEnroe!
Sad to say, but it looks like we have
a new king on the throne.
McEnroe, Set point.
Come on, Björn
One point at a time.
My God!
It's only a matter of time, for a
famous McEnroe comeback.
Hit that right, 40-15.
And it's match point for Björn.
Two match points in the Final
of a Grand Slam.
Björn Borg will be champion.
One point at a time,
One point at a time ...
- Two match points lost.
- Deuce!
And for viewers who,
Aren’t familiar with Tennis...
A tie-break is a final match,
that determines the result of the set.
The first to get 7 points,
Wins.
But two points are needed
advantage to win.
Match point, Björn.
The American is playing well!
Now has set point!
Come on, Björn.
Björn did it!
Great shot!
Sixth match point for Björn.
Seventh match point.
Incredible!
This tension is almost torture.
I can not stand it, Labbe.
The score is 2-2.
McEnroe is not only back in the game,
but he is playing better.
Oh my God!
What's happening?
I'm lighting a cigar.
A cigar of victory, I hope ...
Yes!
He did it again!
The King of Tennis,
without any doubt!
Five consecutive times!
I believe this is the greatest achievement
in Swedish sports!
Incredible...
Shouldn’t you be inside?
Can we leave?
We can?
Are we not the ones who decide?
