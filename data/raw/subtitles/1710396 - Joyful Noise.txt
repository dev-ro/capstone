Not enough, not enough
Not enough love
Not enough, not enough
Not enough love
Not enough, not enough
Not enough love
Not enough, not enough
Not enough love
There's no room for hating
A heart full of kindness
How long will it take, then
For that to ring true?
Our chances are fading
Just stop all this blindness
A new world is waiting
For us if we do
- But there's not enough love in our hearts
- Not enough love in our hearts
They write songs about it
They put it in movies
Our life would be better
With just enough love
- Still, we tend to doubt it
- Still, we tend to doubt it
- Though sometimes it moves us
- Though sometimes it moves us
- We settle for little
- We settle for little
When we could have much
'Cause there's not enough love
In our hearts
No, no
There's not enough love
There's not enough love
There's not enough love in our hearts
- There's not enough love
- There's not enough love
- There's not enough trust
- There's not enough trust
- And it doesn't keep us apart
- Keep us apart
- There's not enough caring
- There's not enough sharing
- Too much "me, me, me" and
- Too much double-daring
- There's too much delaying
- Oh, and not enough praying
I'm just saying It's not enough
Oh, no
I'm just saying It's not enough
Oh, oh!
Not enough, not enough
Not enough love
Not enough, not enough
Not enough trust
- Let's build a foundation
- And change situations
- Strive for salvation
- Heed this revelation
Fall on your knees
And avoiding temptation
I'm just saying
It's just not enough
Unh!
- No, it's not enough
- It's not enough
Not enough, not enough
Not enough love
Not enough, not enough
Not enough trust
- Not enough love
- Come on
Not enough love
- Darling, what's the matter?
- I'm okay.
- It's nothing.
- Something's wrong.
- I know you better than that.
- Vi, take over for me.
Passion in your hearts now
Come on, I'm taking you home.
- Down in our hearts
- Down in our hearts
- Not enough love
- Not enough love
- Down in our hearts
- Down in our hearts
- Not enough love
- Not enough love
- Down in our hearts
- Preach, choir
- Not enough love down in our hearts
- Speak on it, hey, hey, yeah
Friends...
...we are here today to celebrate
the memory of Bernard Sparrow.
Beloved husband, cherished father
and grandfather.
With his last breath...
...he led our choir to victory
in the regional semifinals.
Let the church say "Amen."
Amen.
Bernard loved life. And he knew
how to live it. Isn't that right, G.G.?
The man had five kids.
He must've loved something.
God judges a man on two things...
...and two things alone.
On his faith...
...and on the contents of his heart.
Amen.
And, Bernie, we will miss that heart
each and every day.
Ah.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Mm-hm.
Oh, it was a beautiful memorial service,
Pastor.
I saw your boys, but not your daughter
and her family.
Well, God gives you girls so your mama
can say, "I told you so."
The only thing that would've made it perfect
would have been if the choir had sung.
- But then there was no one to lead them.
- I think I know where this is going.
You need to replace Bernie
as soon as possible...
...so we can continue
in the competition.
I think he would've wanted that.
- Oh, I agree.
- Good.
Because the church council
has already discussed it...
...and we've decided to offer
the position to Vi Rose Hill.
Vi Rose?
Well, I mean, nothing against Vi Rose,
but I helped prepare every arrangement.
I helped choose every song.
Vi Rose has been second-in-command
for a long time now.
Well, it is your decision, of course.
We're very appreciative at the church
of your generous support.
In fact, I don't think we'd be able
to stay open without you.
But...
...that's our decision.
Caleb, what is your country ass eating?
- Pig and pickle mash. You want some?
- Ugh, get that mess out of my face.
Caleb, you are so country...
...you have been married three times
and still have the same in-laws.
Ha-ha! She said he been married
three times and still got the same in-laws.
Small town, big family.
That's just the law of averages.
- He said, "That's just the law of averages."
- Devonne...
- ...do we look deaf to you?
- Oh!
Hey, there she is.
All right, heh, all right.
But, altos, y'all have to look at me
when y'all singing.
I know y'all feeling the spirit, but Jesus
don't know where the cut-offs are.
Look, you all sing as well as I know you can
and we finally gonna whoop Baylor Sykes...
...and that Detroit choir
in the national semifinals.
Pfft. We've been saying that
for four years.
Devonne, save time, see it my way.
Ooh.
Look, y'all, I know y'all miss Bernie.
So do I.
Those are some mighty big shoes to fill.
But I like to think he is right
on my shoulder...
...guiding my hands, urging us on.
What do y'all say?
Y'all with me?
- Pacashau, y'all with me?
- We with you.
Yeah.
- Pacashau.
- That's what I'm talking about.
Well, don't you look as happy
as a puppy wagging two tails.
I did not ask to be made choir director.
Please, Vi, I have known you
for a minute.
The council chose me over you.
When foxes pack the jury box,
the chicken's always guilty.
And when folks get too wrapped up
in themselves...
...they make very small packages.
Olivia, go check on your brother.
He better not be in that car.
What are you doing out here?
It's freezing.
Why do you have those sunglasses on?
You look like Mary J. Blige.
- Light hurts my eyes.
- It's dark.
Mary J. Blige had many hits.
But I prefer one-hit wonders,
like Sir Mix-A-Lot.
Uh-huh.
- What's up, Olivia?
- Hi, Manny.
You ever go anyplace
besides school or church?
- I only see you at one or the other.
- I don't know.
Hey, you think you and me
can go out sometime?
- I'm not allowed to date.
- You're 16.
I'll be a perfect gentleman.
I respect women. For real.
Is this your guitar?
Brand-new Gibson. You want to see it?
Well, hello, Manny.
You know, 30 more feet...
...and you'd actually be inside the church
instead of loitering outside.
Mama.
- I told you to find your brother.
- I did. He's in the car.
I can give her a ride home
after rehearsal, Miss Hill.
I don't doubt that you can
or that you will.
Just remember, there's always
free cheese in the mouse trap.
But trust me, the mice there ain't happy.
Walter. Inside, now.
Aah! Grandma. Wait, it's me.
Randy?
Surprise.
Mm-hm.
Randy, you need to put that thing away.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
- You are in the house of God.
- Yeah, okay.
Now sit down there so I can
keep an eye on you.
Can I help you?
Excuse me, Miss Earla.
But when y'all sing, the angels
just about spit with envy.
Thank you, Mr. Hsu.
You have a very nice tenor voice
yourself.
You got some big old lungs on you too.
You don't mind my saying?
He just call you big?
You just call me big?
Y'all know what y'all doing, right?
- You know what you're doing? Y'all ready?
- Yes, ma'am.
Gonna make a change
For once in my life
All right, now, you're singing too wild.
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
Okay, this is why I shouldn't have let y'all
talk me into doing pop songs in church.
Don't you bring that Mariah/Christina
mess up in here.
I don't care about hearing you.
I want to hear God through you.
As I turn up the collar
On my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their need?
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other
On the wind, you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message
Could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world
A better place
Take at look at yourself
And then make a change
Oh
Nanana, nanana, nana, nana
Oh, yeah
I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be, really me
Pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
A washed-out dream
They follow the pattern
Of the wind, you see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message
Could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself
And then make that
- Change
- I'm starting with the man in the mirror
Oh, yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways
- Change
- No message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself
And then make the change
You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart
Then you close your mind
Starting with the man in the mirror
Oh, yeah
- I'm asking him to change
- Yeah
Change
No message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself
And make that change
Nanana, nanana, nana, nana
Nanana, nanana
- Yeah
- Oh, yeah
- Oh, oh
- Nanana, nanana, nana, nana
I'm gonna make a change
- For once in my life
- Ooh
Whoo! Are you kidding me?
Make some noise up in this bitch.
Heh, uh....
Y'all remember my grandson, Randy.
Did you hear what that boy said?
And in a house of God.
Boy, the apple don't fall far
from the family tree.
- I thought it was funny.
- Oh, you did, huh?
You know, his mother
threw him out the house in New York.
That's why he's at G.G.'s house.
And what did G.G. do to that robe? Getting
it all fitted and taken in like that?
Like she's better than everybody else
just because she's rich.
That woman, I swear.
Did you see the way she looked at you?
Like Jesus left a will
putting her in charge.
I think you have to maintain a certain
speed or you actually go back in time.
And how much did she spend
on all that?
You stay away from that boy is all.
- Tsk.
- Don't suck your teeth at me.
He been trouble since he was 5 years old
and made you eat that goldfish.
Talking about that's where
the little crackers come from.
- Mama.
- Don't think he don't have...
...some new goldfish either.
People don't change,
especially in that family, okay?
And I saw the way
you were looking at Olivia Hill.
You date that little girl, Vi Rose
will just about lay square eggs.
Be worth it.
Hey, now, we're all going around
to the pastor's for lunch on Saturday.
So you behave.
Hey girl
Walter, Olivia.
You're gonna be late for school.
You're too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Cover yourself.
Eye to eye
Too shy shy
Walter.
I was in my room listening
to "Too Shy" by Kajagoogoo.
One-hit wonders are unfairly maligned.
I'm fond of "Walk Away Renée"
by The Left Banke.
Walter, I swear your train of thought
makes all local stops.
Go ahead, eat your breakfast.
- Mail came.
- Give me mine.
Okay, take it easy.
The man writes every week.
You act like it's the Fourth of July.
Why don't he just text or e-mail
like everybody else?
Mm.
Bow your heads. Heavenly Father, thank you
for this food which we are about to receive.
Love letter?
From my father.
He's stationed at Fort Kail.
Oh, I thought he got out of the Army.
- He went back.
- Pssh.
Don't know why anybody
would wanna leave you.
You grew up like you were
on fast-forward.
Like one of them stop-motion
movies of flowers.
Please.
And the way you sing. Oh!
I used to think church music was all corny,
and then you get up there and it's like:
- I never heard anything like that.
- Mm-hm.
Hey. You know I'm a musician too.
What do you say, huh?
We hit the road, start a band...
...make some babies
that look exactly like you.
Oh, you got a nice smile. Always di...
- Oh.
- Oh, my gosh, are you okay?
I have to go.
I'm gonna be late for school.
- Wait, hey. Can I meet you after?
- I have choir practice.
Oh, I'm gonna get in that choir.
Right.
- You'll see.
Mm. That's nice.
That is a lovely hat, Vi Rose.
Thank you, Pastor.
I didn't expect anyone to notice.
Like your hair, G.G. You worried
you're not gonna be seen from space?
Could you pass the butter, please?
Feels downright strange
sitting here with y'all and not Bernie.
- He was our rock.
- Thank you, Pastor.
I keep looking out my window expecting
to see him out on that big old porch.
But, so far,
he hasn't made an appearance.
Times like these,
we feel his loss even more.
Amen.
So, Vi, how is Marcus keeping himself?
Just fine, thanks.
- Two years is an awful long time to be away.
- Crazy, you ask me.
I mean, who rejoins the Army
for a second time at age 35?
Someone who's out of work
and wants to feed his family.
All right, Olivia.
- And wants to serve his country.
- It's confusing, that's all.
- What you trying to say?
- Well, it's not just me.
The whole town's confused.
It's none of this town's business
about me and my husband.
Well, it is a small town, Vi.
And people do care.
And if you don't like that,
maybe you should move to New York.
My mama told me if people swept
in front of their own doors...
- ...this whole world would be clean.
- Hell, yeah.
- What?
- Ha-ha.
Apologize for your language,
young lady.
I'm sorry.
It was just surprising when he left.
That's all.
Yeah, to all of us.
There have been more
one-hit wonders in hip-hop...
...than in the entire 30 years of music
that preceded it.
All right, Walter.
My particular favorite is "Walk Away Renée"
by The Left Banke.
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me....
When Walter gonna sing, ain't nothing
you can do but sit back and enjoy it.
The em...
He gets a little nervous around people.
I think it's time to say grace.
Dear Lord, we come before you...
Walter, Pastor trying to say grace.
Excuse me.
Walter, you okay?
You know, there's nothing to be nervous
about. Everybody here loves you.
Uh, can I try?
There's nothing you can do when he's
like this. It's his Asperger's syndrome.
- I don't like to be touched.
- I won't touch you. Uh, look.
Hey, I will sit all the way down here.
Okay?
Okay, good. Now just play that note.
This one. Right there.
Good. Good. Okay, now, just do it in time.
That's good. That's perfect. That's great.
Okay, now, keep doing that.
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block
Are not the same
You're not to blame
That's "Walk Away Renée."
Hey, you know, um, if you want,
I could give Walter piano lessons.
Walter, would you like that?
Come on.
Here you go.
You go out there and win
that competition, you hear?
We're counting on you.
Ah, there but for the grace of God.
Amen.
I worry about my job at the hardware store
and my boss is my own father.
Well, like he always says, people always
need a hammer or a doorknob.
I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin', she poppin', she rollin'
She drivin' that pole
And I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin', she trippin', she playin'
I ain't goin' nowhere, and I'm stayin'
I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin', she poppin', she rollin'
She drivin' that pole
What? I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin', she poppin', she rollin'
- I'm in love
- I'm in, I'm in love
With a stripper.
Do it right now. Come on and pray.
Baylor Sykes
and the Holy Vision Church of Detroit.
They're the reason we never make it to the finals.
They always beat us at regionals.
- Why don't you do songs like this?
- Can you imagine? With my mother?
So how long until regionals?
Two weeks.
I should go.
If she knew I even came out here
to sit with you, she'd explode.
Will I see you tomorrow?
See you when I get home from school.
Don't look at my butt. I'm a good girl.
- Stop it.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You wanna join the choir?
- Yes, ma'am.
He's a good singer, Mama.
A great singer.
Yeah, when he's singing about
being in love with strippers.
I mean, do you know any decent songs?
Because they don't have to be corny.
How about, um,
Sly and the Family Stone?
I want to take you higher
Do you even know who Sly Stone is?
You just wanna be near my little girl.
Just listen to him, Mama.
- He is good, Vi.
- Yeah, how would you know?
We've been sneaking in
some extra rehearsals.
Excuse me?
We wanna win, Vi.
- Come on, give him a chance.
- Go ahead, Vi, give him a shot.
I'm sorry.
I'd call you stubborn,
but that'd be an insult to mules.
Heh, oh, she said she'd call her stubborn,
but it'd be a insult....
Vi, don't deny him
just because he's my grandson.
Maybe I'm amazed at the way
You love me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid
Of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way
You pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way
I really need you
Maybe I'm a girl
Maybe I'm a lonely girl
Who's in the middle of something
That she doesn't really understand
Maybe I'm a girl
And maybe you're the only one
Who could ever help me
Hey, won't you help me understand?
Ooh, help me understand
Maybe I'm amazed at the way
You're with me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid
Of the way I need you, yeah
Maybe I'm amazed at the way
You help me sing my song
Right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way
I really need you
Yeah
Maybe I'm a girl
Maybe I'm a lonely girl
Who's in the middle of something
-Oh
- That she doesn't really understand
Maybe I'm a girl
Maybe you're the only one
Who could ever help me
-Oh
- Hey, won't you help me understand?
- Ooh, help me understand
- Help me understand
Maybe I'm amazed at the way
You love me all the time
- Love me all the time
- Maybe
Maybe I'm afraid of the way
I love you
Ooh
Maybe I'm amazed at the way
You pulled me out of time
Ooh
- Yeah
Maybe
- Maybe I'm amazed at the way
I really need you
Maybe I'm amazed
Maybe I'm amazed
Maybe I'm amazed
Oh!
Oh, maybe I'm amazed
- By you
- By you
- Amazed
- Amazed, amazed
- By you
- By you
Come on.
Oh! Ah! That was amazing.
It was like... It was like you knew
everything I was gonna sing before I sang it.
Well, we rehearsed all week,
so it's not magic.
It was magic.
You felt it too, I know you did. Heh.
What?
My mother says when I sing,
I should just be the instrument...
...not try to be more important than God.
But singing is the only time
I feel important.
Where I don't feel like I'm this close
to disappearing.
I don't know,
I guess I'm just being prideful.
Hey.
So what?
You deserve to be as proud
as you can be.
Seems to me your mother
doesn't tell you that near enough. Heh.
Hey, well, I'll tell
you, I am proud of you.
And I would be very upset
if you disappeared.
Young love.
I haven't been with anyone
in three years.
Four.
As long as you live
Someone who loves you
Tender like I do
You'll never find
Oh.
No matter where you search
Someone who cares about you
Wakey-wakey, Mr. Hsu.
The way I do
I made you a big breakfast.
Mr. Hsu?
Oh, Mr. Hsu.
I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else
No
Mr. Hsu.
God.
Cherish the brief time
you and Mr. Hsu had together...
...rather than weep for his loss.
That's not why I'm crying.
Oh.
- Why are you crying?
- Well...
...what man's ever gonna
wanna be with me after this?
From now on, I'll just be known
as the girl who, you know....
Tap it and die.
- I hear that.
- No.
Go, go, go. She wakes up
if I breathe funny in the next room.
- Hey, Vi Rose, I have your daughter.
- Stop. That's not funny.
- Don't wake up, I'm stealing her.
- Stop.
I'm gonna keep you dancing
Baby, all night long
Drop it nice and low
Take it to the floor
Let me see you work it
What you working for?
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe it.
Olivia Hill and not a pew in sight.
Come on, Manny, I wanna dance.
Don't talk to me like you know me.
I just met you 10 minutes ago.
You look pretty.
Would you like to dance?
I'm sorry, son.
She promised this dance to me.
Baby girl, you're with me
'Cause you're beautiful
Got it going on, baby
From head to toe
And I'm gonna take you home
If you don't wanna go
I still have you on my phone
- I can't, Randy. I don't know how.
- Yes, you do.
I know you dance all alone
in your room to your radio.
Got a little stuffed animal going:
You wanna be a church girl
the rest of your life?
There's so much more to you than that.
Come on.
Baby girl, you're with me
'Cause you're beautiful
Got it going on, baby
From head to toe
And I'm gonna take you home
If you don't wanna go
I still have you on my phone
'Cause I like the way
You like to dance with me
And I like the way you looking
In them jeans
And I wanna take you home
If you don't wanna go
I still have you on my phone
Let me get your bedpan.
Okay, here we go. Okay.
It's okay. It's all right.
Hey.
Lazy bum.
It's time for your lesson.
No one wants to hang out with me.
That's not true.
I like hanging out with you.
You're like the only guy friend
I have here.
I don't wanna be like this, you know.
To have no idea
when people are joking...
...or when they want me to shut up
and leave them alone.
I think everything's fine...
...and then they leave a tissue
full of shit in my locker.
There are always gonna be jerks
that wanna treat you badly.
I mean, my mother called me stupid
so many times...
...I finally believed her and quit school.
Hey.
Crazy or not, you're an awesome kid.
I mean, you're scary smart.
You picked up the piano
like you have alien magic powers.
And....
And I'm really glad I met you.
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Part of my condition is I can't tell
when people are coming on to me.
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
Hey. You know what I think?
I think we need more than
a piano lesson today.
- Hey, Randy.
- Yeah.
I just realized we're lying
on the left bank of the quarry.
And The Left Banke
is the name of the band...
...who recorded "Walk Away Renée."
They spelled "bank" with an E.
You know how you don't know when people
want you to shut up? Shut up, Walter.
Come on, you try it.
- No.
- Come on.
Damn, you can sing, boy.
You know, you should join the choir,
Walter, or at least play with the band.
I can't. It's too loud. It hurts my ears.
See, that's just an excuse you use
so you don't have to be around people.
You're afraid you're gonna be embarrassed
or rejected. But you are strong, talented.
And I need a friend there...
...to stand with me
against your psycho mom.
That woman is crazy
That woman is crazy
That woman is crazy
That woman is crazy
That woman is crazy
- That woman is crazy
- That woman is crazy
That woman is crazy
- Didn't know anyone else came here.
- What do you want?
Me? Nothing.
Got a problem
you wanna iron out with me?
I don't know who you think you are, son,
coming into town, hitting on Olivia.
She don't mean nothing
to you but a challenge.
The challenge is everything.
You're the one
that don't mean nothing to me.
Come on.
What are you doing? Huh?
Unh! Quit hitting me in the nuts.
Yeah!
Yes!
That was great.
What happened? You okay?
- We beat his ass, Mama.
- You got into a fight?
He saved my life.
You'd have been proud of him.
Answer me. Somebody hit you?
He didn't get the chance. I was too fast.
Too fast? Look at you. Go to your room.
Whoo-hoo! Ha-ha.
- What happened?
- It wasn't a big deal. You'd have been proud.
He didn't have to talk about one-hit
wonders or worry about being touched.
I mean, he saw me in trouble
and he just went for it.
Know what? You a falling-rock zone.
And anybody who stands
too close to you...
...is gonna have a whole mess of rocks
fall on them too.
He's fine. He's better than fine.
He's proud.
Look at him. He feels like a man
for the first time in his life.
That's not how I want my son
to feel like a man.
- Where's Olivia?
- Never mind about Olivia.
Get out of my house.
- Mama, no.
- I told you to go.
I'll deal with you in a minute.
She can't keep me from seeing you.
She was just angry. She'll get over it.
Why am I defending her?
She wants to control my life.
It must kill her that she can't
control Walter's too.
What kills her is feeling guilty
for Walter's condition.
That's why she holds y'all so close.
Maybe too close.
There I go again.
Is there such a thing as being
too good a Christian?
Because that just may be my problem.
I wish you really knew my father.
He's the total opposite of her.
Well, then I know who you take after.
I'll just leave this right here.
Excuse me.
Whoa!
- Back to your corners.
- All right.
This is not gonna turn into that
in my house.
And get your little butt off my table.
That's where I eat.
Welcome to the
Joyful Noise Regional Finals.
And now, four-time champion
Holy Vision Church of Detroit...
...featuring Baylor Sykes.
Hey, hey, hey
Thought I had it together now
Hey, hey, hey
Thought I could handle the weather now
Hey, hey, hey
Thought I'd make it on my own
Hey, hey, hey
But now I see I was wrong
- Hey, hey, hey
- Ow!
I think the same when you're not with me
Hey, hey, hey
I feel the change when you're near me
Hey, hey, hey
I'm not afraid to be strong
Hey, hey, hey
I know I'm never alone long
Uh!
When no one's around
And the rain's falling down
You cover me
Hey! Do I have a witness
out there somewhere?
On that side? Let me hear you.
When my days turn to night
Will you rescue me?
I hope they see
Oh, Lord, not again.
Those aren't the same singers
from the clip online.
And if they say I'm crazy about you
I just want everybody to see
Ha! Hallelujah.
Maybe they are just that good.
I just want you to see.
I just want the whole world to see
- I'm in love with you
- Oh, oh, ah
- I'm in love with you
- Oh, oh, ah
- Jesus, I'm in love with you
- Oh, oh, ah
His love is deep till the end....
They'd have to rehearse
like eight hours a day.
Don't these people have jobs
or families?
So the whole world can see
- Can see
- Let me hear you.
Y'all ready?
- Ow!
- Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
On that side, sing.
Hey, hey, hey
- Whoo!
- Can't make it without you
Clap your hands.
- Ain't a good day without you
- Come on.
And if they say I'm crazy about you
I just want everybody to see
When they look at me.
When they look at me
I hope they can see
- I gotta tell the world, y'all.
- I just want the whole world to see
- I'm in love with you
- Oh, oh, ah
- I'm in love with you
- Oh, oh, ah
- I'm in love with you
- Oh, oh, ah
Jesus, I'm in love with you
Uh, uh
Listen here, listen here I say
You've been good
I'm in love with you
You've been kind
I'm in love with you
You've been great
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
Yeah!
Let's go.
Whoo!
Cheer up. We can't win them all.
They're just disappointed.
We all are.
You know, Pastor,
I been thinking about this a lot.
I think next year, we need to do
more traditional songs.
Like, not so many horns.
Not going to be any next year, Vi.
It's official.
What?
- It's too expensive and we always lose.
I'm sorry.
I don't consider making it to the regional
finals anything to be ashamed of.
Of course not. But every year?
- Wait, really?
- What?
We didn't before that.
The money is best used elsewhere.
Well, it's not about winning or losing.
It's about giving our town
something to believe in.
A reason to drive 300 miles and have
a little something to cheer about...
...instead of sitting home,
watching everything fall apart.
It's about praising his name.
And we can praise his name on Sunday
in our own church.
I didn't create this economy.
It's been settled.
P is for polar bear.
Did you see her face when we lost?
She was actually surprised.
- She be saying "less horns" when...
- Olivia, do the voice.
Less horns.
When what she needs to do...
...is get rid of the tired
old-timey arrangements...
- ...and let you get your hands on them.
- Mm-hm.
And let Earla choreograph us
some moves.
Ah, like that's gonna happen.
It could. We just have to convince her,
that's all.
All right. Keep your voice down.
- She's at work. She can't catch you here.
- You're scaring the animals.
See, they're all staring at us.
- It's because you're so hot.
- Shut up.
Look at the yak.
He's totally into you.
Come on.
What do I have to do to cheer you up?
Huh?
- Hey. Hey. Come on. Let's go.
- Go where?
Come on. Don't you worry
about where we're going.
- Don't take my blanket, I'm comfortable.
- Don't care. Give me your hand.
- Where?
- Ha-ha-ha. Don't worry about it.
If we go outside, I need my shoes.
- Okay, I got them.
Where we going?
- I told you, on a date.
A date where? We left town an hour ago.
It's a surprise.
My mother's gonna kill us both.
At least we'll die together.
- She could be somewhere dead in a ditch.
- Oh, don't be so dramatic.
There's no reason to think like that.
Kids run off all the time.
Mostly, they come right back.
It's not like Randy's never pulled
a stunt like this before.
This is your fault.
You brought that hoodlum into our lives.
- No wonder his parents kicked him out.
- You don't wanna go there, Vi.
The best thing you can do
is just go about your business.
- I will call you as soon as I hear anything.
- Go about my business?
Yeah, right.
Hey. Hey, wake up.
Daddy?
You called him?
I took a pretty big chance here.
I'd really appreciate it if you'd smile.
Just walk away, Renée
Oh....
You won't see me follow you....
That's his favorite song.
Hmm.
- How's your mama?
- She's changed, Daddy.
Don't blame your mama for that.
Being left alone can change anybody.
I was the one that ran out.
Randy, can you give us a minute?
I'll be outside.
Look.
I could've stayed.
Now, Olivia, listen to me. This ain't
a easy thing to say to your daughter.
I could've tried harder.
The truth...
...is I couldn't... I couldn't face knowing
that I failed your mama.
No job, no money.
I saw it every time she looked at me.
I know that look.
No, no, no. She was sweet back then.
You remember how she used to be.
I thought the only thing I could do for
y'all was leave and send a paycheck home.
Your mama...
...is the best person I ever met.
And it took being away from her
to realize that.
And now I need you to love her.
And love her hard.
Because I don't think
she's gonna want me again.
And that....
That is a hard thing to live with.
That's not true. She always watches
those home movies with you both dancing.
And I see the way her face looks
when we read our letters.
She tries to fight it,
but I know she misses you.
What letters?
Baby, I haven't sent any letters.
I think your mama
must have been writing them.
I'm sure she thought
it was a good thing.
I have to get back.
I want to be with you.
Baby, I ship out soon.
It's my job.
You worried?
Me too.
Did you know gospel is the only
musical genre with no one-hit wonders?
No.
Why you love gospel so much, Mama?
Why you ask?
Because I just don't understand
what's so great about God.
You don't mean that.
Seems like he don't do much
around here that I can see.
Give me those glasses.
Let me see that sweet face of yours.
Baby, you have to think of God
as a parent.
You know when I punish you
or make you eat your greens...
...you may not like it, but you know
I love you, no matter what, right?
Right.
Even if you don't understand
why I do what I do.
Well, just like I'm your mother,
God is our father...
...and we have to have faith because
we know he loves us, no matter what.
But....
But what, baby?
You spend all your time...
...singing songs and praising God...
...and he's who did this to me.
He made me this way.
If you loved me, you'd hate him.
- I do.
- No.
- I hate him. I do.
- Walter. Don't say that, Walter.
I just wish I could be normal...
...for you, Mama.
For me?
Baby, you don't have to be anything
except exactly who you are.
I love you.
Come here, come here.
They broke the mold
when they made you.
And when someone don't fit
into a neat little box...
...the answer ain't to squeeze them
in there even harder.
You build a bigger box.
Shoot, God don't make no mistakes, Walter,
and he ain't about to start with you.
Fix me, Jesus
Fix me
Oh, fix me
Oh, fix me
Oh, fix me
Fix me, Jesus
Fix me
Fix me for my home on high
Fix me, Jesus, fix me
Fix me for the by and by
Fix me, Jesus, fix me
Fix me for my starry crown
Fix me, Jesus, fix me
Fix me for a higher ground
Fix me, Jesus, fix me
Oh, fix me
Oh, fix me
Oh, fix me
Fix me, Jesus, fix me
Fix me, Jesus, fix me
Fix me, Jesus
Oh, fix me
Fix me, Lord.
Hello?
Don't do anything stupid over there.
You've never been the bravest man.
Don't abandon that quality now
that it can actually do you some good.
Now, most husbands
would take offense at that.
Be safe.
