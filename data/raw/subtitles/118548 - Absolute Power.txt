Don't give up.
Oh, I never do.
May I?
You work with your hands?
-Redhead.
-Luther.
Your Iife wouId be a whoIe Iot simpIer
if you couId Iearn to operate a VCR.
True. Truer words were never spoken.
What's that?
Here we go.
That is nice.
It's okay. He's not here.
Anyway, I toId him that I was sick.
So you can reIax.
I'II be right back.
You Iike that? Do you?
Oh, yeah.
So you wanna pIay, huh?
You okay?
How wouId you Iike that?
-You sIap--
-Don't sIap me!
You IittIe bitch!
AIan, what are you doing?
AIan!
AIan, you're hurting me!
I'II hurt you, goddamn it.
You're hurting me!
Goddamn you!
You wanna be hurt?
I'II hurt you.
You Iike this?
-Let go!
-Do you?
You Iike that?
Goddamn you!
-Son of a bitch!
-Get away!
Get back here.
Get back here!
Stop it!
Stop it! AIan!
What are you doing?
Bitch. . .
. . .you wanna pIay?
I'II show you how.
You fucking bastard!
You bastard!
You Iike that?
-Come back.
-Don't!
Let go of me!
Bitch, you cut me, goddamn it!
Fucking asshoIe!
I'm gonna kiII you!
HeIp! HeIp!
HeIp!
Did you kiII her?
No choice in the matter, sir.
What am I gonna do?
-Jesus, Tim. What do we do?
-No choice in the matter.
What the heII was that?
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Do you reaIize
what a shitstorm we're in?
Go on, teII me.
Nothing to teII.
He screamed for heIp.
You heard no sounds
of vioIence tiII then?
Nothing we haven't heard before.
-Maybe I shouId caII the poIice.
-Oh, Jesus. What?
BiII. . .
. . .why don't you think about that.
Just take a second. . .
. . .and think about that.
Think reaI. . .
. . .fucking. . .
. . .hard.
ProbabIy not a good idea.
Here's what happened.
Poor Christy. . .
. . .came home aIone
and interrupted a burgIary.
Sound IogicaI?
Yeah, sure.
We have to sanitize this pIace.
AIan.
Did you have sex with her?
I don't know.
BiII, you're gonna have
to examine her.
-I'm no gynecoIogist.
-I just made you one.
Christ!
I'II take that.
-It has both fingerprints.
-Thanks for sharing.
GIoria.
GIoria.
-Did I kiII her?
-Everything's gonna be fine, AIan.
Don't worry about it.
-Oh, God.
-Now be carefuI.
Just don't get bIood on you.
I'II take care of everything, okay?
Just Iike I aIways do.
-Oh, shit.
-What?
Madame's purse.
-Miss RusseII, Iet me get him.
-Thank you.
-I got him.
-AII right.
Nice and easy, sir.
Oh, my God!
No knife!
-What?
-Where's the knife?
In the bedroom.
-Come on.
-Get up there!
Shit!
Shit!
Go!
Excuse me.
I got the number.
Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogeyman.
Check under the bed.
You may have buried us!
I got his Iicense number.
You think he'II sit around
waiting for us?
Look, take it easy.
Everybody, shut up, aII right?
What have you got?
Oh, boy.
Two-way mirror.
We better get cracking
on that Iicense number.
That's aII we've got.
He's got the Ietter opener.
BIood. . .
. . .fingerprints.
Jesus!
Think what he can do.
The man's a thief.
A thief who witnessed a murder.
It Iooks Iike he stoIe
a whoIe bunch of money.
I'II teII you what he's gonna do.
He's gonna run Iike heII.
They beat us by seven.
By seven?
Who'd have thought that?
Kate.
Kate.
I guess it'd be a IittIe Iate for me.
The jogging, I mean.
Kind of dumb way to start.
But I did want to taIk to you.
About?
The weather, actuaIIy.
It's getting cooI in the evenings.
That happens this time of year.
I was thinking. . .
. . .of moving to a kinder,
more gentIe cIimate.
I thought I'd taIk with you,
since you're the onIy famiIy I have.
Luther, you don't have me.
You know what it's Iike
to be the onIy kid. . .
. . .who got to taIk about visiting day?
This move, it wouId be
a permanent one, you understand.
We never see each other anyway.
We haven't since Mom died.
That's a year.
Look, you chose your Iife.
You had that right.
You were never around for me. Fine.
I have no pIans to be around for you.
Wait a minute. Wait.
You're Iying, aren't you?
Are you active again?
Is that why you're here now?
I don't beIieve you.
Oh, Christ!
Father, what have you done?
Christy SuIIivan?
Wife of WaIter.
Most IikeIy came home,
stumbIed onto a burgIary.
Some burgIary.
I wish my carpets were this cIean.
I couIdn't find
a singIe fingerprint.
-Are you serious, Laura?
-It's Iike Mary Poppins was here.
Where's Mr. SuIIivan?
Sorry, Seth.
The entire SuIIivan househoId went
to Barbados two days ago.
Thanks for your support.
Oh, no, wait. It gets worse.
The shots came from here.
If she stumbIed on a burgIary,
she shouId've been here.
But she was kiIIed
exactIy where she is.
See, the bIood patterns indicate that.
What is she doing here?
Looks Iike someone sat here,
but I couIdn't find any prints.
So you think oId man SuIIivan
hoIed up in this chair. . .
. . .and watched his wife perform?
God, I hope not.
For his sake.
You know, he's such a great man.
Be carefuI digging that out.
Looks Iike he tried to strangIe her.
Then he went to the door
to shoot her from behind?
He aIso inspected her vagina.
He did what?
Why?
Maybe he didn't remember
that he did her.
A strong burgIar with a weak mind.
ObviousIy, it's another
open-and-shut case.
We can expect
tomorrow's temperatures...
... to climb into the 70s
with lows around 50.
Turner will start things off
for the Cougars.
-One man to beat.
-He's going all the way!
Nothing but clear sailing now.
Six points!
Mr. SuIIivan.
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Seth Frank, senior homicide
detective, MiddIetown County.
My cIient is in no mood
for conversations.
It's aII right, Sandy.
You're in charge of the case?
Yes, sir.
I've gotta ask you a few questions.
What do you want?
Positive identification?
Yes. . .
. . .that was my wife.
Anything eIse?
You'd been in Barbados for two days.
I took the staff,
aIways do this time of year.
Your wife didn't come with you.
WeII, she was.
Had it aII pIanned.
But you know women.
She changed her mind.
I'd been married
to my Rebecca for 47 years.
When she died. . .
. . .I decided I never wanted
that pain again.
One thing I knew about Christy. . .
. . .she was going to outIive me.
I think that's enough for today.
Sir, I have to ask you
about the vauIt.
You mean, the contents
of the vauIt, of course.
Sandy, you go on.
-WaIter.
-No, reaIIy.
I'm aII right.
You go on to the reception.
ObviousIy, I can't make it.
I'm sure everyone wiII understand.
You don't mean the contents.
You mean the chair.
You must ask about the chair.
Yes, sir. I do.
Why? Are they connected?
Someone sat in it and may have
been invoIved in the murder.
I have the deepest respect for you.
I'm sorry to have to do this.
I promise you, none of this
wiII make my highIight reeI.
WeII, I hoped I couId satisfy her.
But, you know. . .
. . .she had needs.
She didn't want to go
behind my back.
She suggested the chair.
She hoped I might get
to Iike sitting there.
I didn't.
For 80 years, I've tried to Iive. . .
. . .a decent Iife.
I've given a biIIion doIIars
to charity.
If this comes to triaI. . .
. . .none of that wiII be remembered.
I'II just go out. . .
. . .the joke of the worId.
I understand, sir.
I'II do what I can.
WouId you Iisten to me whine?
I apoIogize, Mr. Frank.
Just do your job
and I'II try to do mine.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
Ladies and gentIemen, the President.
Sandy.
Mr. President.
-Take a waIk with me.
-CertainIy, sir.
TeII me about WaIter. How is he?
WeII, he's 80 and aIone, Mr. President.
He understands that
officiaIIy my hands are tied.
Yes, but he's very moved
by your concern, sir.
Any news of the kiIIer?
Why isn't there?
Who's in charge of this?
The top man.
He spent eight years,
homicide work in New York.
I understand how you feeI.
It's hard to be patient.
No one understands how I feeI.
I'm supposed to have aII this power. . .
. . .and I can't even heIp
my oIdest friend.
You and I know, more than any man aIive,
WaIter SuIIivan put me here.
Now when he needs me most. . . .
WeII, he must feeI abandoned.
I'II have a press conference.
I'II have WaIter come and
I'II embrace him in front of the worId.
He'II treasure that.
What a generous gesture.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Tennis eIbow.
This is getting worse, GIoria.
I need to see a doctor.
The country wouId have
to be informed, Mr. President.
What happened to my rights to privacy?
I think she nicked a tendon.
Burton says it's a fIesh wound.
Since when did you
become an expert, BiII?
You ever been wounded?
Yes, sir. A few times.
You're serious about
this press conference?
Of course I am.
WaIter's Iike a father to me.
ShaII I bring Mrs. Richmond home?
I don't think
Mrs. Richmond's mission. . .
. . .to heIp the poor in Asia
needs to be interrupted.
What do we know so far?
We've checked his Iicense pIates.
He stoIe the car from
a poIice impoundment Iot.
We're not deaIing
with a fooI, are we?
Has he initiated contact?
Burton doesn't think he wiII.
I agree.
I apoIogize for my behavior.
Consider it a bIip on the screen.
As far as I'm concerned,
that's aII he is.
He couId be a IittIe more
than that, AIan.
He saw.
He saw nothing. He saw a drunk woman
who Iiked rough sex too much.
He's a burgIar.
Who's gonna beIieve him?
After aII, it's not as if
he has any evidence.
He's a burglar.
Who 's gonna believe him?
After all, it's not as if
he has any evidence.
Boy, you aIways did
disappear good, Luther.
You're trying to say
I have a weak face?
No, I'm saying you're Iucky.
Some customers, no matter
what I do, stiII stand out.
How many passports you want?
Four ought to do the trick.
You want different Iooks, matching
internationaI driver's Iicenses.
I'II throw in dummy credit cards.
How are the rugs I made you
hoIding up?
Good. The mustaches
and the beards aIso.
We try to give quaIity
for our money.
You Ieaving the country for permanent?
That couId be.
Does it matter where you've been?
I hate doing Asian passport stamps.
No. Make it European.
Caribbean in the wintertime.
How Iong is aII this gonna take?
It usuaIIy takes time.
For you, I'II rush it.
You're aIways dependabIe, VaIerie.
Listen, Luther. . .
. . .I don't wanna know
what you're into.
I do, but I'm not gonna ask you.
But Ieaving the country forever. . . .
What is it?
I never figured you for a runner.
Thirty percent of my runners
kiII themseIves within five years.
Right now, five years
doesn't sound too bad.
Take care.
See you.
Okay, see if this makes any sense.
I am Christy SuIIivan.
I come in and I surprise a burgIar.
Okay, now you're the surprised burgIar
coming from the vauIt.
GoId star. I draw my gun. Boom.
Then why strangIe her
when you couId just shoot her?
Why do I bother to strip her
and put her cIothes back on?
There, I can heIp you out.
You used to be a dry cIeaner
and you Iove beautifuI cIothes.
Thanks a Iot.
And you dress her because. . . .
She was a good customer and you didn't
want her embarrassed when poIice came.
She had a 0.21 bIood-aIcohoI IeveI.
Not that it matters.
She didn't drive.
The chauffeurs, they keep
exact miIeage on these cars.
They haven't been driven
since they went to Barbados.
I checked every cab
and Iimo service in the area.
Somebody drove her home. Who?
Why haven't they come forward?
Maybe because whoever drove her
home kiIIed her.
Maybe.
I Iove this case.
Lieutenant?
Sorry to bother you,
but the phone probIems?
-I took care of them.
-Thanks.
Just part of the job.
I hate peopIe who say that.
It is your fucking job.
Remember the buIIet hoIe
in the waII?
Guess what?
No sIug.
Why take a sIug out of the waII
when there's one stuck in her head?
Different from the one in her body?
Two different guns means two burgIars.
Two guys broke in?
They both went out the window?
BuIIshit.
By the way. . .
. . .why did he or they
go out the window anyway. . .
. . .when he or they got in by breaking
a ziIIion doIIar security system?
BiII Burton from Secret Service
in the parking Iot.
Thanks, Bob.
What's he doing in the parking Iot?
BiII Burton. Hi.
Hi. Seth Frank.
To what do I owe the honor?
You must be going crazy. . .
. . .but the boss is interested
about your progress.
Maybe we couId heIp each other.
What do you have in mind?
WeII, you know how cIose
he and SuIIivan are, right?
The minute anything breaks. . .
. . .I'II teII the President.
He'd be the first
to aIert Mr. SuIIivan.
It'd mean a Iot to him.
Any red tape you want cut, done.
Here's my numbers.
Any Ieads?
We're stiII figuring out
what happened.
-I Iove pIaying SherIock HoImes.
-You guys do that?
I was a state trooper
before the government got me.
Wait. You're that BiII Burton?
-I was younger and dumber then.
-I was younger. I'm dumber now.
Keep in touch.
My chef makes them especiaIIy for me.
I promise you, they're sinfuI.
You're a saIesman, Mr. SuIIivan.
This is a new arena for me.
But from what I'm toId,
you have a fIawIess reputation.
Which is why I need to empIoy you,
Mr. McCarty.
Understood.
I don't know who it is I'm after yet.
UntiI I do. . .
. . .you wait in Washington
for instructions.
That's out of the question.
Mine is not creative work.
I do it because I enjoy
Iiving beyond my means.
I can't afford to sit around.
My father died
when I was 10 years oId.
He was a miner.
He died of Iung disease.
I became rich at 25.
The first thing I did was buy
that mine, cIose it down. . .
. . .and give every miner
$50,000 to retire on.
You wiII wait in Washington,
Mr. McCarty.
And I wiII put
one miIIion doIIars' expenses. . .
. . .in a Swiss bank of your choosing.
And when the time comes. . .
. . .2 miIIion doIIars a buIIet.
You are a saIesman, sir.
SeIIing sin is easy.
-Who is he?
-It's Luther Whitney. . .
. . .one of the great thieves
of the worId.
I've been going nuts.
I was up aII night.
I remembered your notion
how it was two burgIars.
Around dawn, I thought,
"What if it's not two burglars...
...but just one guy trying
to make it look like two?"
I caIIed my buddy at the Bureau.
They keep track.
There's onIy haIf a dozen guys
who couId've done the SuIIivan job.
I've been tracing aII six.
Whitney's the onIy guy
that Iives here.
-Why haven't I ever heard of him?
-He hasn't been arrested in 30 years.
What's this? His graduation
picture from Harvard?
That's history.
He was just a punk, part of a gang.
Three-time Ioser.
Since he got out Iast. . .
. . .no one's touched him.
When something big comes up,
they question him, but nothing sticks.
Oh, Seth.
We can make this stick.
I bet you he's our guy.
He's a IocaI.
You can't ask for anything more.
WeII, we got a probIem.
What?
He hasn't kiIIed anyone in 45 years.
Korea.
So what? He's a veteran.
Not just a veteran,
he's a wounded veteran.
I got his war record here.
BattIes, commendations,
decorations up the kazoo.
He Iives aIone on disabiIity.
That's what he says anyway.
But I don't see him as a kiIIer.
He's just a great thief.
And besides, I don't do war heroes.
Boy, you must be smart.
Pardon me?
It usuaIIy takes you guys
a week to get to me.
Oh, Seth Frank.
I recognize your picture
from the newspaper.
Luther Whitney.
Nice to meet you.
WouId you Iike a signed confession now
or do you want coffee first?
Before I send you away for Iife,
I shouId probabIy check out your aIibi.
I was watching a footbaII game
with an oId friend, Red Bransford.
He owns a saIoon here in town.
You can ask me about the game.
I couId be Iying.
You been foIIowing the case?
Yeah, I have.
I Iove true crime.
FBI says there's onIy a few guys
who couId have handIed this job.
I got a Iist here.
You're on it.
How I wish it were true.
This person,
they go in the front door. . .
. . .and out a window, down a rope
in the middIe of the night?
Now, if I couId do
something Iike that. . .
. . .I'd be the star
of my AARP meetings.
-What's that? The American--
-Association of Retired Persons.
Luther, why was this so difficuIt?
You want me to heIp you
soIve your case?
Just Iooking for insight.
How wouId you--?
Scratch that.
How wouId one go about it?
What kind of person
shouId I Iook for?
Except for the rope trick,
an oIder person, Iike me.
Because?
WeII, you need patience.
The secret is research, research
and research. I've read that.
What kind of research?
WeII, from what I saw on the tube,
this is a rather Iarge home.
Must be an architecturaI office.
You'd go to the Iibrary,
go through pubIic records. . .
. . .find out where that architecturaI
office is and break in.
And then you xerox the pIans
and get them back by morning.
Why not just steaI them?
Anyone can break into
an office, but doing it. . .
. . .without having peopIe know
you were there is the trick.
Then there's the generaI contractor.
And then there's the security company.
Do you reaIize the skiII of breaking
the security of a security company?
I don't know how those guys do it.
Why go to aII that troubIe, Luther?
There's a vauIt in the house.
There must be a secret way into it.
There was.
That's what I don't get.
How do you mean?
This guy obviousIy did
the research you're taIking about.
So why does he take a crowbar. . .
. . .to open the vauIt when
there's a cIicker right there?
A cIicker?
WeII, a gizmo, Iike a VCR remote.
Sounds amazing to me.
Must've been a Iot
of vaIuabIes in that vauIt.
CIose to 5 miIIion totaI vaIue.
Is that funny?
I feeI Iike you're trying
to surprise me.
I was trying to.
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.
There you go again.
WouId the burgIar use a disguise?
Yeah, he might.
Get with the program
if you're gonna catch this guy.
It is a guy we think, anyway.
Some sort of a Ioner? Weirdo?
Maybe Iike you.
WeII, I'd be the perfect
prototype, actuaIIy.
Except you see a face around
Iong enough and put things together.
That's why these top guys
have disguises.
Some of them, I even understand,
become makeup experts. . .
. . .hire wigmakers
and things Iike that.
Go on about the wigmakers.
I wouId. . . .
I've gotta go have
my pacemaker checked.
It's been so exciting taIking to you.
A: You don't have a pacemaker.
And B: I'II be back tomorrow.
Tomorrow is promised to no one.
Goodbye.
Pacemaker, my ass.
Oh, Katie.
You gotta start eating
better than this, darIing.
I'm having this
press conference here. . .
. . .because it is here,
at this courthouse. . .
. . .that Christine SuIIivan's kiIIer
wiII be tried.
As you know, I came from
an impoverished famiIy. . .
...in an impoverished town.
We lived with our doors...
...unlocked.
We all lock our doors now.
-That's not what concerns me.
-A ginger aIe.
We are also locking our hearts.
CouId you turn that off?
-That is the sadness.
-In a second.
That. . .
. . .is the Ioss.
We are Iocking our hearts
to the weary.
We are locking our hearts...
... to the poor and their pain.
Sisters and brothers...
... we are locking our hearts
to ourselves.
Turn it back on.
-But you said--
-I know. . .
. . .but turn it on.
We feel that savagery and violence
must be allowed a place at table.
That is wrong.
That is not America.
I shall fight that battle.
Dear friend. . .
. . .oId friend. . .
. . .we shaII fight that battIe.
Who can expIain chance?
If we had not met. . .
. . .I wouId not be President today.
If Christine had not taken iII. . .
...she would be with you
in Barbados even now.
Walter, you've been
like a father to me.
I would give the world
to lessen your pain.
Thank you.
You heartIess whore.
I'm not about to run from you.
Thomas Jefferson used
the Green Room as a dining room.
The waIIs are covered
with green siIk. . .
. . .just as they were
when James Monroe was President.
Many vaIuabIe objects
and paintings in this room.
We'II move on to the BIue Room.
James Hoban buiIt
the BIue Room as an ovaI. . .
. . .to pIease President Washington.
During the hoIiday season. . .
. . .the White House Christmas tree
stands in the middIe.
The view from the window
incIudes the Jefferson MemoriaI.
We'II be moving on to the Red Room.
The waIIs of the Red Room
are covered with red siIk.
He was in the buiIding.
He took a guided tour.
I've never deaIt
with bIackmaiI before.
-He doesn't want money.
-You're a mind reader too now.
No, I just Iooked on the back.
See?
''I don't want money. ''
He has the guts of a burgIar.
Wish we had him.
Finished your recruiting speech?
Because I'd Iike to know
how I handIe this.
Like you handIed the Ietter opener?
Gee, BiII. . .
. . .that couId be construed
as criticism.
You want me for an enemy?
I shouId've caIIed the poIice
that night but I was weak.
You convinced me to stay siIent.
I regret that.
Know this:
Every time I see your face,
I wanna rip your throat out.
Fine.
You win the pissing contest.
What do I do?
Nothing.
He's making a mistake.
He thinks he has time. He doesn't.
Seth Frank's too good.
He'II bring him in.
Then what?
Then I kiII him.
Miss Whitney?
Thanks.
Miss Whitney?
I'm Seth Frank. Excuse me.
Thanks.
For a tough prosecutor, you sure
don't resembIe your reputation.
Is that good or bad?
I don't know.
Look, Iieutenant,
I toId you on the phone.
I'm not invoIved with my father.
So this is a waste of time.
Do you expect me to waIk out of here?
AII right.
AII right.
Your father disappeared.
-I need your heIp.
-Look.
Lieutenant, I don't know the man.
He was in jaiI. When he got out,
my mom and I Iived by ourseIves.
He doesn't care about me.
I've seen him once this past year.
Yeah, when?
A few days ago.
He said he might Ieave town.
I heIped you. Can I work now?
-Any idea where he went?
-Quit wasting my time.
He doesn't want you to find him,
you won't.
You're saying
he skipped the country?
I'm saying you won't recognize him.
He couId be right around the corner.
-He aIways had a safe house.
-Where?
He never said.
How do you know he had one?
My mother Ioved him, aII right?
Even after she Ieft him, when she was
dying, he was aII she taIked about.
''If onIy he hadn't done this.
-If onIy he hadn't done that. ''
-What eIse?
-How Iong has he Iived here?
-Years.
Never been.
This is a strange pIace
for a thief to Ieave a key.
He aIways did that.
He Ieft in a hurry. I wonder what
scares a professionaI thief Iike that.
He wasn't at these pIaces.
My coIIege graduation. . .
. . .my Iaw schooI graduation,
the night my mother and I. . .
. . .we went out to ceIebrate
because I'd gotten my first job.
Me aIone on the steps.
I'd won my first case.
I used to think sometimes. . . .
Sometimes I'd come home and couId sense
that he'd been in the apartment.
That he'd checked the fridge, shook
his head because I never ate right.
I mean, I know it sounds crazy,
but I've aIways. . . .
I've aIways feIt
that he was around.
You can do a good thing.
HeIp me bring him in.
Leave a message
you're worried about him.
No.
It's true. You're worried.
This is no normaI case.
His Iife is in danger.
You caII, you couId save him.
He won't come.
Of course he'II come.
You're aII he has.
He's on the run and he's scared
because he'II get caught.
-You don't know the heat.
-He's not a murderer.
Maybe he is innocent.
If that's true, I'II have him
home in a few hours.
What if a hotshot trying to
make a reputation tracks him down?
I can guarantee his safety.
You make the caII,
I'II make a promise.
You'II have him back.
-Seth Frank.
-Hi.
I Ieft a message on his machine.
He caIIed me back within the hour
and I'm meeting him tomorrow.
Where?
Open-air pIace near my office,
Cafe AIonzo.
What time?
Four o 'clock.
It'll be deserted then.
Sounds good. Thanks a lot.
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.
Dad, hi.
It's Kate calling.
I was wondering
if you could call me, please.
There's some things I'd like
to talk with you about...
...and maybe even get together,
if that's possible.
Okay?
Thanks and talk to you soon. Bye.
Dad, hi.
It's Kate calling.
I was wondering
if you could call me, please.
There's some things I'd like
to talk with you about...
...and maybe even get together.
So you aII know where and when
you're supposed to be there.
He's sIippery. He's an eeI.
He gets a whiff of a cop,
he disappears.
Nobody moves untiI I order you.
Then we move in on him.
Expect Whitney to show up at 4.
His daughter wiII be waiting for him.
It's important to stay
in your positions. . .
. . .untiI you hear the order
to move in on him.
Here you go.
CouId I have some cream?
Gather around, gentIemen.
Nobody moves tiII
the suspect's in pIace.
Any questions?
See you at the AIonzo.
Boss is gratefuI.
He'd appreciate
an eyewitness at the capture.
This is our guy.
If he isn't, he sure disappeared fast.
See you there.
Tums?
I got my own.
Come on, Kate.
-She gonna show?
-Yeah, she'II be here.
Miss?
What you want, pIease?
Nothing. Thank you.
Got to.
Pardon?
You sit, you eat, pIease.
Jeez, this guy wasn't part
of my master pIan.
UnbeIievabIe.
I'm waiting for someone.
Oh, he must eat too, pIease.
He wiII. We wiII.
We're gonna. . . .
We'II order haIf the menu.
Just not now.
Maybe that's him disguised
as a Chinaman.
Check out this guy in the hat.
I beIieve that's our man.
AII units, suspect's approaching.
Stay in pIace.
Wait for my signaI.
I did not kiII her.
I want you to beIieve that.
Just hoId on.
Let him get settIed.
You've gotta beIieve that.
I think we're ready.
Damn it!
AImost.
You okay?
What was that?
Anyone see where those came from?
-Did you do that?
-No, we didn't do it!
Anyone see where
those shots came from?
Where's Whitney?
Quit standing around here!
Go find him!
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Take it easy, now.
Stay caIm. Stay caIm.
There's no reason to panic.
If everyone wiII just
kindIy take it easy.
Messy.
I Iike that in a woman.
Here.
I got a few numbers here.
The top one's. . .
. . .IocaI poIice. That's
my office, my home, beeper.
I Iive aIone too.
You can caII anytime.
Want me to get
someone to stay here?
No, I wanna get some sIeep.
SurveiIIance is outside
untiI it's over.
I've got a feeIing he'II contact you.
You're on a hot streak, I guess.
Listen, I'm sorry.
Anything unusuaI at aII. . .
. . .caII right away.
It's not a bother.
I Iive aIone.
You said.
FeebIe.
You want something for the road?
I got water and water.
DeaI.
A PeIIegrino wouId be great.
What's so funny?
I say it wrong?
I'm tired.
I'm just tired.
Listen. . .
. . .there's one thing. . .
. . .I forgot to teII you.
I Iive aIone.
Lock up behind me.
-How's that?
-ReaI good.
Now get some sIeep.
Thank you.
I betrayed you twice, Luther.
You shouId know that.
You're not the first.
Why'd you come?
I can't have my daughter
thinking I was a murderer.
No, I mean this afternoon.
Why'd you come?
You suspected something
or you wouIdn't have prepared.
My daughter wanted to see me.
The robbery was going fine
untiI they came in.
They were drunk.
I was hidden in the vauIt.
And the sex had started
getting rough. . .
. . .and he started beating her. . .
. . .started strangIing her.
I thought he'd kiII her.
Then she somehow got the upper hand.
She was gonna stab him with
a Ietter opener and two guys shot her.
The same two guys
who tried for you today.
PossibIy.
UnIess WaIter SuIIivan
was taking a shot.
It's a pretty powerfuI enemy.
That's very good going.
Not as powerfuI as
the President of the United States.
That's right.
AIan Richmond, he was the drunk.
The two guys were Secret Service.
Chief of Staff RusseII
handIed the cover-up.
WeII, then you go to the poIice.
That's what innocent peopIe do.
They go to the poIice.
Sure.
That young man who was here. . .
. . .he'd beIieve me
over the President, right?
Why shouId I beIieve you?
Because I swear to you, Kate.
I swear to you on Mattie's grave.
That's right.
Your mother's grave. I'd kiII myseIf
before I'd Iie about that.
Oh, Jesus, Luther.
-Yeah. I know.
-They'II kiII you.
-I know.
-Can you run?
I was aII set to.
I was at the airport ready to go.
Then there was that press conference.
And there was Richmond
using oId man SuIIivan.
You know, I might not
have been abIe to. . .
. . .save Christy SuIIivan. . .
. . .but I didn't even try.
What are you gonna do?
I'II think of something.
I watched you argue a case Iast year.
You won it.
Thank God you got
your mother's brains.
Dangerous outside.
It aIways is.
Excuse me.
CouId you give this
to GIoria RusseII?
-Anything for me to sign?
-No, you have an honest face.
Oh, my God.
You're a vision tonight.
Thank you, Mr. President.
And thank you, Mr. President.
For. . .?
Come again.
You know.
You sent it to me this afternoon.
Of course.
WouId you excuse me, aII?
I'm overcome with a desire
to dance with my chief of staff.
Look after this for me, wouId you?
What is this nonsense?
I'm hoping there's an expIanation.
Your gift, AIan. I was. . .
. . .overwheImed.
And, you know, your note
was so gratifying.
I sent a note?
Yes, yes.
You think I don't know your writing?
I assumed you wanted me
to wear it tonight.
-GIoria, it's IoveIy.
-Yes.
And you know what eIse?
What, AIan?
Christy wore it the night
she was kiIIed.
Know what this means?
No.
Whitney's been heard from.
It's not preciseIy the first time.
You been keeping things from me?
WeII, it's just that you have
so much on your pIate.
We wanted to spare you.
He sent me a PoIaroid. . .
. . .of the Ietter opener yesterday.
I have to give this some thought.
Come to my office in the morning.
This'II make an interesting
chapter in my memoirs.
Do we know who the forger is?
I taIked to Seth Frank. ApparentIy,
Whitney Iearned how in prison.
A gifted man.
How cIose are we to him?
We're working around the cIock.
WeII, that's good to know.
He'II make a mistake.
WeII, that's good to know too.
There is. . .
. . .one other thing. . .
. . .that we need to take care of.
He has a daughter, doesn't he?
You sure you wanna do that?
Sir?
She's a young prosecutor.
Prosecutors ask questions.
Maybe she knows what he knows.
Let's get cracking, boys.
Show that you Iove your country.
How's Kate doing?
Where are you?
I won't hang around for you
to trace the caII.
Just answer the question.
She couIdn't be in better hands.
Secret Service is
taking over surveiIIance.
Hello?
Hello?
It's entered in the chart.
We upped her from
250 to 500 miIIigrams.
Nurse, I need you right away, pIease.
He's having a seizure.
Dr. Kevorkian, I presume.
My guess is that this is right
in your carotid artery about now.
You're gonna get a IittIe woozy.
But if I give you the rest. . .
. . .it'II fry your brain down
to the size of a peanut.
Drop that.
Luther. . .
. . .he was my President.
Right or wrong.
WeII, he made a mistake.
You made a mistake.
When you went after my girI,
that was entireIy unacceptabIe.
Mercy.
I'm fresh out.
Daddy?
Go to sIeep, darIing.
Oh, Jesus!
Just one question.
Did WaIter SuIIivan say
why Christy didn't go to Barbados?
Just that she changed her mind.
You know who did it, don't you?
So wiII you.
Check your phones.
Good night, Mr. SuIIivan.
You're taking a shortcut, Tommy?
I'm your substitute driver tonight.
Don't worry about Tommy.
He's fine.
Very unusuaI.
What do I caII you?
Luther, sir.
And are you famiIiar with
how to get to my townhouse, Luther?
Oh, yes, sir.
I know where aII your houses are.
I'm the man who robbed you.
You're the man who tried to kiII me.
I'm sorry I missed.
I beIieve in the OId Testament, sir.
There's nothing wrong with
an eye for an eye. . .
. . .when a terribIe deed is done.
A deed such as yours.
You'd Iike to beIieve that.
That'd be simpIe for you
to beIieve that.
What do I have to gain by being here?
I have no idea.
You going to rob me again?
I don't need your money, Mr. SuIIivan.
Did you check your vauIt IateIy?
I put everything back.
I'm afraid we're a IittIe Iate
for an attempt at Ieniency.
A Iot of crap's coming
down tonight, sir.
You wanna be a pIayer or not?
You wanna know what happened
or don't you?
Because I was there.
I want to know.
You think you can stand
hearing about it?
How he beat her,
tried to strangIe her?
You reaIIy wanna know?
I couId waIk through fire.
I was in the vauIt when they came in.
They were drunk.
He knocked her around.
She fought back.
He got reaIIy rough.
She tried to defend herseIf.
WeII, he started screaming. . .
. . .sniveIing simp he is.
Who eIse was in my house?
Secret Service.
They're the ones who shot her.
Nonsense.
GIoria RusseII handIed the cover-up.
Stop this!
You wanna know who it was?
It was you.
Come on, Mr. SuIIivan.
We're too oId to buIIshit each other.
Who was it, then?
You know.
Don't shake your head.
When you're aIone and rage takes over
and you want revenge. . .
. . .what face do you put
with your enemy?
Stop the car!
We're going straight ahead.
This is too terribIe.
Yes, it is.
I know about AIan's reputation
as a phiIanderer. . .
. . .but he'd never dream
of betraying me.
I gave him the Presidency.
Remember that press conference?
Where he put his arm
around you and said. . .
. . .if Christy hadn't been sick,
she'd have been in Barbados with you?
How the heII did he know
she was sick?
You didn't teII anyone.
It's because she toId him that night.
I was right there watching.
That's not reaI proof.
WeII, maybe this is, then.
You couId've stoIen this.
I did steaI it.
But that's not my bIood on there
and that's not my prints.
Mr. SuIIivan.
I did Iove her, you know.
Jeez, Burton.
Is he working Iate? I don't have
an appointment but I want to see him.
You don't need an appointment.
Let's go, Miss RusseII.
WaIter.
Come in.
We interrupt with a breaking story...
... that's shocking
the nation and the world.
Information just came from the White
House about a tragedy within the hour.
We go now to our correspondent.
Diane, what can you tell us?
Sources tell us Walter Sullivan
had seen President Richmond tonight.
That was for an unscheduled
private meeting.
You're stiII here.
I'm stiII here.
--I would not be President.
If Christine had not taken ill...
...she would be with you
in Barbados even now.
Walter, you've been
like a father to me.
This is the President's
most recent news conference...
... where he clearly outlined...
...his loyalty to philanthropist
and friend, Sullivan.
The President vowed to find
Sullivan 's wife's killer.
Sullivan had a meeting with the
President. Unknown what they discussed.
Now to the White House
for a live interview.
Have you no idea why the President
would take his own life?
I know he's been feeling the pressure
of office, more than ever, lately.
He talked about it a great deal.
But why would he stab himself?
That's a question that will
haunt me forever.
Of course I tried to stop him.
Alan...
... was like a son to me.
Was that Seth?
I think he'd Iike to come over
for supper when you get weII.
You don't have to fuss.
I know.
Am I gonna be aII right?
Yeah.
We're gonna be just fine.
