"He wanted to cry.
He wanted to give
himself up to despair.
And when he came
to, he found himself
stretched out on
the bed and a fairy
was sitting next to him.
'Tomorrow, your wish
will come true,'
the fairy said.
'What is it' Pinocchio replied.
'Tomorrow you'll
cease to be a puppet
and you're going to
become a real boy.'
Pinocchio was beside
himself with joy.
But it wasn't meant to be.
Next day, he fell
down on all fours
and began running and
jumping around the room.
His arms turned into legs,
his face became a snout,
his back covered
with long gray hairs.
And the most horrible
moment was the one
in which he felt
his tail appear.
And overcome with shame
and grief, he began to cry.
But what's done
can't be undone."

You okay? I thought I

Okay.
Food's ready.
Yeah.
You listen to me. Hmm?
We start thinking about
the things we're missing,
we forget about
the things we have.
You're perfect just
the way you are.
Never forget that.
Okay?
All right. Let's eat.
[sighs]
[insects chirping]
You know, I'm hoping
your grandparents
will be able to come
down for the holidays.
Won't that be nice?
[chopsticks scraping]
It's pretty good.
Have you tried it?
Dylan, what's wrong?
[sighs] Yes.
But he was very old. Right?
Don't have to worry about it.
Not for a long time.
Whoo, how'd that happen? Huh?
Oh no, the tiger awaits.
He awakes. Oh, got it.
[laughing] Oh. [laughing]
All right, come on,
come on, eat, eat, eat.
You gotta eat
something. All right?
[upbeat electronic music]
Okay, you sure you're
gonna be okay without me?
I can always pick up a
double another night.
Um, oh!
The number for the pager's
on the fridge. Okay?
If you need me, just call.
Oh, keys, key, keys, uh!
Don't forget to take
a shower before bed.
I'll be home before you get up.
And, hey, tune in around 9:30.
I've got a surprise for you.
Love you.

[Michael] "At the start of
the final hour of the day,
set a candle aflame.
Place three drops of fresh
blood into the melting wax.
Face your reflection,
speak these words,
and make your wish known.
'Spirit of fire, let the
wheel of fortune turn.
Grant me my desire.'
Should your strength
of will survive
until the stroke of midnight,
extinguish the
flame and the Djinn
will grant your heart's desire.
But beware the Djinn's toll.
For the gift that you seek,
may cost your soul.
[ominous music]
Artifacts required, one
clock, one candle, one mirror."

Working now,
authorities have
confirmed the identity
of convict, Norman Daniels
after he was killed in a
hit and run late last night.
Authorities report
that the 31-year-old
escaped a maximum security
detention center...

[Michael Voiceover] "At

Extinguish the
flame and the Djinn

But beware, the Djinn's toll,
for the gift that you

[suspenseful music]
[pages turning]
[distorted whispering]
Part man and part
beast in nature,
the Djinn is one of the
five immortal guardians
of the Shadow Realm.
Appearing to those who
conjure the Wish of Desire,
the Djinn will grant one wish
to anyone brave
enough to survive
an hour in its presence.
But it will consume the
heart of all those who fail,
damning their soul to the
Shadow Realm for all eternity.
Assuming the form of the dead,
the Djinn will often
grant wishes in such a way
as to thwart the
desires of the summoner.
Their fulfillment
frequently leading
to unintended consequences.
Although immortal, the
Djinn is susceptible
to the laws of men when
in the human realm,
able to regenerate only
upon return to its world.
It may only be banished if
the flame is extinguished
after the stroke of midnight."
