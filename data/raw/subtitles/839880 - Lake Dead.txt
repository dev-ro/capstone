There is also a lake. 
You go from there. 
Thank you for the help.

This is my girlfriend Amy. 
This is Gloria, she runs the hotel. 
Gloria Day, pleasant acquaintance. 
Do you have a room that I can use? 
Of course, baby.

This is wrong. 
Let us another search. Okay? 
Come on. We find it alone. 
What happened?

And they said that there are good places to camp. 
There is also a lake. 
And with Sam?

That is strange.

They can be anywhere, hè? 
Have you Sam? 
Search the hospitals, between the pills. 
She is not here. 
We are going to fun. 
Are we camp?

Come we go. 
Oh, my God. It is beautiful. 
We have one more.

Let's go swimming. 
We do our bathing suit. Come on. 
Come on Amy. 
It does nothing. 
You said it. 
Brielle, come inside.

I unpack. 
How is my mailbox?

Nothing, I became a Kocen ofzo. 
Stop that.

My scholarship. 
What does that in your swimsuit? 
My eyes, damn. 
With eyes still closed. 
Where were we gone? 
I think you look to Tanya. 
-- Do you? 
Do you like her? 
-- Why do I like her? 
Why not then?

How many times have you been strangely gone? 
Old cows benefit from the canal, hè? 
Listen, I love you. 
Okay? 
Excuse me in the leg.

Would they be angry if they saw me so?

Why do you see then? 
Do not so naive Bill. 
Once see if you can my fire extinguishing. 
We can not say. 
Certainly not against Kelly. 
Versta you me? 
I swear it. 
How long that lasts for a little wood? 
Perhaps they found nothing. 
And they have reasons. 
That they will have. 
Do not be stupid. 
-- It was a joke. 
Do not paranoia. 
Are you angry with Tanya? 
-- Why should we harm to Tanya? 
Tell me now that you can not feel guilty. 
Quiet to a little. Seffens 
They are suspicious. 
It was fantastic, okay? 
Sorry for what happened. 
Make no difference. 
It's just sex. 
We go back. Soon they search us. 
Why did you do that sletje also brought? 
-- Walk around Amy, you know its not. 
Quietly, maybe they lost.

And what has happened to Bill? 
She was not alone. 
Can you hear anything?

Come on, run. 
Wait, wait.

In the car, quickly. 
Connect the camper. 
There is nothing here with our camper? 
No, no problem. 
Thank you officer.

Exuseer me sir.

If I call from the federal car is a hell. 
So we wait until we are safe and then call us. 
Should we not to the police station? 
You have quite beautiful blue eyes. 
How you actually called?

See you. No problem. 
So Ben, what happened? 
You need to calm down. The police is now here.

A damn tree. 
This is so terrible. This is so ... 
What are we going to say to his parents? 
-- I know that it is terrible. 
But it is not our fault. 
It is our fault. 
We have them here. 
It is not our fault. 
We knew not. 
Sorry girls. Do you worry if I enter? 
-- No. 
I need your version of the story. 
Thus Brielle, but first you tell your story. 
We were at the camping and ... 
When our friends Bill and 
Tanya wood to the search ... 
Wait smooth. 
Starting from the beginning. 
What do you mean? 
Why are you here.

We have come here for the hotel ... 
You inherited this place, right? 
Yes, that is correct. 
Hello girls. 
Sheriff there is a call for you. 
Here's what coffee. 
It is hot. You do not burn. 
Do you feel better now? 
Coffee helps a little. 
The plans have changed. 
I have them still to 
Headquarters. 
Why? 
-- Staatspolitie. 
Drink that. 
I have to tell Ben. 
Look where you walk girls. 
Ok?

I am so tired. 
-- Sleep smooth. 
I am also tired. 
Your father told us 
Forever leave this time. 
Make you but do not worry. 
The tradition is not dead. 
Not as long as there is blood 
This world to feed. 
And coincidentally, it is there. 
Your father had two mothers 
Of which he is not inlichtte. 
But I knew his little secret. 
Oh yes. I knew it. 
After your brother John left us. 
He rot but in hell. 
Brielle, Kelly. Your blood is 
Not as pure as you. 
There is nothing else. 
They have a part of our family. 
Verstaan? 
Listen carefully. 
They come here this weekend. 
Is there anyone. Let them away. 
I just want to Brielle and Kelly. 
Nobody else. 
They have one other sister Samantha. 
She is not our blood. 
She has been adopted. 
If Samantha distributed ... 
You know what you should do. 
Verstaan? 
Let me see your teeth. 
Stay with your feet of her. 
Tap her. 
You should be outside. 
What I said? 
Do not touch! 
What you laugh? 
Test me. Make me no harm. 
You have a mess. 
And I have to clean up. 
If you want to see than loverboy 
You keep your door okay? 
Your brother makes me mad. 
Extract the camper and insert the bodies inside. 
I love you. 
Here is Brielle and Kelly. 
... Speak. 
Are you OK? 
-- What happened? 
Where are they headed? 
Is that Marilyn Monroe who drink tea? 
-- Come here and we talk about it. 
Got your nichtjes to the house? 
-- Yeah sure. 
Should I bid? 
I wait for your brother 
Back with the camper. 
Listen son, how big was this junk? 
-- They are quite messy. 
How big? 
-- Very large. 
Go ahead and see that everything is in order. 
Wait. 
-- What is happening? 
Where is my kiss? 
Here is a road. We are so gone. 
I hit my only concern. 
I have solid. 
One moment a.u.b., okay? 
Damn, that hurts. 
Let those idiot the door open. 
Why leave your door open? 
Where are you? 
Where are they? 
They ask a question. 
They ask a question. 
They had sneakers. 
Jump in the car. 
Concentrate now. 
That they are. 
Wait. 
We cut them off the pass. 
I can no longer exists. Let me. 
-- No, komaan. 
There they are then. 
A walk to? 
Come on we go. 
In the car. 
In the car. 
What do you do with them? 
Let 'm silence. 
Run your belt over. 
Rule it. 
We have nothing done? 
Why are you doing this to us? 
Be patient and everything is fine. 
Go to the house! 
What do we call you? 
You have my son slain. 
You increase the family. 
Basel What you say? 
-- It is simple yet? 
We are family. 
You, Kelly, I ... chuck. 
I am your grandmother. 
No. 
The blood is thicker than water. 
Thus, the blood pure. 
Maybe you will find it even more fun. 
You are seffens's turn. 
Just wait. 
Damn. 
Wait. 
Put her on the table. Are you the first time? 
Family party is over bastard. 
Let her go. 
Feeling strong now, hè? 
Finish what you started art. 
I do what you want. 
I will listen, okay? 
We will have a happy family. 
-- Yes. 
He brings her to the barn. 
Stay here. 
No, I come along. 
Come on. 
My brother, your father ... Held 
Not like our family. 
Come on, tell me about your family. 
Go to hell. 
We are not a family. 
Do not. 
I try ... 
The well. 
Are you here? 
Watch. 
They were good boys ... 
Fishing, hunting. 
Brielle, together we build the Lake family. 
That we will do. 
Wherever you go girl? 
What do you think of me? 
The surname. 
It can be so easy. 
Do not forget to beat. 
It can be so easy. 
Ga damn of my daughter. 
Wait your turn off Johny. 
Go outside. 
Close the door. 
It was the last time Chuck. 
Move around. 
You have no guts. 
That's it for family verneuken. 
It pains me so. 
He needs to a hospital. 
Sta. 
Would it leave? 
Perhaps we should take a look. 
It is a little creepy. 
It seems to me to be not such a good idea. 
Suppose someone.
