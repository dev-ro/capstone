C´estpour toi, chéri.

Need a little help there?

- Jimmy, l´m beat. l´m gonna go home.
All right, all right. One drink.

* How many times have l been downhearted
* Looked up and saw him
smiling like a shiny dime
* And hoped that he would stay
and tell me why he was so happy
* lf he had the time
* Oh, l wish there was a way to race him
* Catch a flying horse and chase him
* Everybody´s goin´ to the moon
* Me and you, everybody´s goin´
* lt´ll be quite soon
* lt´s customary in songs like this
* To use a word like spoon
* By the light ofthe silvery
* We´ll take a flight to the silvery
* Everybody´s goin´ to the moon
* How many times, while looking down
has he heard us singing songs
* And wondered who we were
* Hey!
* Then envied us because
the lady in the moon is gone
* And now he misses her
* And then he wondered to himself
now why is it no one ever pays a visit?
* Everybody gets to go to the moon
* Yeah, yeah, yeah
* Everybody gets to go, it´ll be quite soon
* Now it´s customary in songs like this
* To use a word like June
* By the light ofthe silvery
* We´ll take a flight to the silvery
* You know, everybody´s goin´ to the moon
* Now, isn´t it a miracle
* That we are the generation
* That´s gonna touch that shiny bubble
with our own two hands
* And it´s got to make you glad to be alive
* Yes, it´s got to make you proud to be a man
l make at least two junk connections
at that far table over in the corner.
The guy in the striped shirt and tie combo,...
..l know him too.
l thought we came here to buy me a drink.
(Jimmy) Who is that clown?
lt´s a policy guy from Queens.
- (Jimmy) Dig the creep comin´ to the table.
- (partner) lt´s Jewish Lucky.
He don´t look the same
without numbers across his chest.
That table is definitely wrong.
* lt´s customary in songs like this
* To use a word like spoon
* By the light ofthe silvery
* Fly to the silvery
* Everybody´s goin´ to the moon
(applause)

We´re gonna keep comin´ back

Turn around there, fella.
What have we got here?
This belong to you? Huh?
Stand up there, noddy.

- Where you been?
- ln there.
- Can you stand a toss?

No, man. Who are you, Dick Tracy
or somebody? l said l was clean.
- l´m not gonna get stuck, am l?
- l´m clean!
- lf l do, you know what happens.

Doesn´t register.
There´s been some talk, though.

Comin´ in this week, the week after.
Everybody´s gonna get well.
- Well, who´s bringin´ it?
- Who knows?
- Where do you want it?
- Huh?
- Where do you want it?
- Oh, shit. This side.
Beat it!
l´m gonna check on this address.
lfthey don´t know you, it´s your ass.
- l thought l told you to stand there!
- Get that hair down before Saturday.
We´re goin´ now. Goodbye!
Move ass. Tell everybody
we´ll be back in an hour.
Great, but you belong in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood.
Why don´t you detach us? Give us a shot, at
least till we find out ifthere´s anything here.
Everybody wants Weinstock. Maybe here´s
the lead we´re looking for. We deserve this.
You couldn´t burn a three-time loser
with this garbage.
The man has done absolutely nothin´.
You´ll wind up in an entrapment rap.
Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own
candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs.
You put this hustler together with Weinstock
and maybe we got a big score.
Big score, my ass! At best
he´s sellin´ nickel-and-dime bags.
l wouldn´t be infringin´ on your coffee break
if l thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.
Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle,
or have you forgotten about that already?
Jesus Christ, Jimmy,
what´s happened to you guys?
Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in
arrests. What was it, over 100 again last year?
Terrific. But who? What did you bring in?
A high-school kid in short pants
that had a twitch?
You grab a bellhop because
he´s got three joints in his sock?
Walter, we got the information
there´s no shit on the street, right?
lt´s like a desert full ofjunkies
waiting to get well.
Goddamnit, this could be it. This little
candy-store guy, he´s put on a big show...
..in a club with no narcotics connections.
They were all over him.
And after working a day and night,
we tail him to Brooklyn.
And we sat on him for practically a week, and
who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock.
Now you gotta let us have it.
Do you believe all this crap?
l go with my partner.
- What´ll it take?
- A wire.
No, two wires.
One on the store, one on the house.
You know l have to get a court order
for a wire tap, don´t you?
- But you´ll try.
- We know you can do it, Walt.
Popeye, you still picking your feet
in Poughkeepsie?
J´entends parler de ça.
Je n´arrive pas á y croire.
Alorsje vais un peuparlerpourmoi.
J´ai tendance á... penser
á mes propres problémes, enfiin...
Monsieur Devereaux, is this
your first trip to New York?
- Yes, it´s my first.
- Why did you choose to come by ship?
The next several weeks
will be very difficult for me,...
..and the ocean is the only place where
the telephone isn´t ringing all the time.
Do you agree with the recent survey finding...
..that showed that Mayor Lindsay
was the sexiest man in the world?
(interpreter translates into French)
Toutá fait, oui.
Here´s the warrants and the court order
for the wire tap. Judge gave you 60 days.
Mulderig and Klein´ll sit in for the feds.
They´ll make all the buys.
Make sure you keep ´em informed
of everything that goes down.
You know Doyle there, don´t you?
Yeah, l know Popeye. His brilliant hunches
cost the life of a good cop.
lfthis is the way you´re comin´ in on this,
why not stay home and save us a lot of grief?
- Because that´s my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.
Whatever.
Bill, do me a favour, give them a chance.
He came in with a little basic information.
You worked with him, had some trouble,
but don´t get off on the wrong foot.
- You have any problems, come to me.
- Simonson, just keep off my back.
Just try and cool it with him. lfyou have
any problems, come to me. l´ll handle him.
- l´ll be happy to work with him.
- He´s a good cop.
- He´s got good hunches once in a while.
- Fine. Just keep him off my back.

Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
Someone told me the reason
why you do that is...
..when you meet a chick
and you rub up against her,...
..she can´t tell you´re a cop.
l said it´s bullshit. lt´s gotta be
a fast-draw gimmick or somethin´.
Bill, why don´t you knock it off, huh?
He´s gettin´ too far ahead.
You´re gonna lose him.
(carhorns)
(driver) For Christ´s sake, move the car!
(Doyle) What the hell is goin´ on here?

Klein, this is Cloudy. Do you read me?!

He made me, too.
He lives on four, he went up to six.
He´s cute, real cute.
The other guy´s a Frog. He checked
into the Edison. Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.
- Who´s on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
Why don´t you do the same, Doyle?
You look like shit.
(Cloudy) Come on.
Look, my partner and l

- Case? So far you haven´t shown me a thing.
You keep shootin´ your mouth off,
l´m gonna knock you right into next week.

- Don´t tell me to knock it off.

There´s nothin´ goin´ down. Get some sleep.
Blastoff. 180.
200. Good Housekeeping seal of approval.

Junk-of-the-month club. Sirloin steak.

lfthe rest is like this,
you´ll be dealin´ on this load for two years.
- lt´s worth the half million?
- How many kilos?
- 60.
- 60 kilos...
Eight big ones a kilo, right? This stuffll
take a seven-to-one hit on the street.
By the time it gets down to nickel bags,
it´ll be 32 million.
Thank you, Howard. Take what´s left
there with you and good night.
Uh-uh. Not that one. The little one.
- l guess we got a deal, huh?
- What we got here, Sal, is a test.
A deal for half a million dollars? Maybe.
Maybe?
Come on, the guy´s in a hurry. He wants
the bread. He wants to go back to France.
This guy´s not gonna play games. Look, he´s
one ofthe shrewdest cats l ever come across.
What am l, a schmuck? What´s the hurry?
He could see a couple of shows,
visit the top ofthe Empire State Building.
Don´tjerk me, Weinstock.
l spent a lot oftime settin´ this one up.
So what do you want, a badge?
This is your first major-league game, Sal.
One thing l learned: move calmly,
move cautiously, you´ll never be sorry.
Look, l´ve been damn careful up to now.
This is why your phone lines are tapped and
the feds are crawlin´ all over you like fleas.
- He´ll take the deal somewhere else.
- Let him take it and find out how easy it is...
..to put together a half a million in cash.
There´s no hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We can make the switch in an hour!
Look, l´m tellin´ you,
he´ll split ifwe don´t move.
This guy´s got ´em like that.
He´s everything they say he is.
What about you, Sal?
Are you everything they say you are?
That son of a bitch.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- This is Doyle. l´m sittin´ on Frog One.
Yeah, l know that. We got
the Westbury covered like a tent.
The Westbury, my ass! l got him
on the shuttle at Grand Central.
Now what the hell´s goin´ on up there?

He was free as a bird.
What the hell are you talkin´ about?
Yeah, well, uh...
Listen, l don´t care how many

That´s right. Same to ya, buddy.

Son of a bitch!
Hi. Can l have a round-trip

- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Have a nice flight.
- Yes, sir?
- Round trip to Washington.
- So?
- So everything´s goin´ great.
Terrific. Beautiful.
l´ll need a few more days, though.
The boys think we oughta cool it for a while,
just to make sure there´s no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think l asked you
to meet me in Washington?
l haven´t spent five minutes in New York City
without the company of a policeman.
Look, l´m levellin´ with you.
l need a little more time.
My people think we oughta find a better time
to make the switch, that´s all.
lt has to be by the end ofthis week.
Look, Charnier, you gotta be reasonable.
lt´s your problem.
Well, it´s your problem, too.
So nice to have seen you again.
(arguing)
We found a set ofworks
on the kid driving the sports car.
- His girlfriend´s in the back. She´s dead.
- Give the car a toss.
- l say we keep sittin´ on Boca.
- Jimmy, give it up. lt´s all over with.
lfthere was a deal, it´s gone down by now.
We blew our warrants and we blew our cover.
Listen, l know the deal hasn´t gone down.
l know it. l can feel it. l´m dead certain.
Last time you were dead certain,
we ended up with a dead cop.
Break it up! Will you two break it up?
Stop it! Hold on to yourself.
What´s the matter with you?
Jimmy, you wasted two months on this.
No collars are comin´ in...
..while you´re runnin´ around town

You´re off special assignment!

Hey, Coke, you all right?
Don´t answer.

(coughing)
This is all solid.
There´s nobody been under that car
since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
l don´t buy that, lrv.
The stuff is in that car.
Well, you find it. l can´t.
Enfiin on ne va pas passerlajournée ici.
Ça fait deuxheures qu´on estlá.
Soyez patient.
Look, the car was lost sometime last night.
First they send us to Pier One,
then here. Then what?
Why did you park the car
down by the waterfront?
You´re staying in midtown Manhattan
and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations
for a film for French television.
He probably left the car to look at something.
We were told by the police commissioner
that the car was brought to this garage.
- l demand its immediate return.
- You have to be patient.
We get four or five hundred cars here a day.
Monsieur Devereaux is
an important guest ofthis country.
He is working with the absolute cooperation
and participation ofyour government.
Here are his credentials
from the French consulate.
Unless you wish to see this in his film,
l suggest you locate the car immediately.
You´re in a no-smoking area, sir. Would you
please extinguish your cigarettes?
What was the weight ofthe car
when you got it, lrv?
4795 pounds.
You sure?
That´s what it was.
4795 pounds when it came into the shop.
Owner´s manual says 4675.
That´s 120 pounds overweight.
And when it was booked
into Marseilles it was 4795.
That´s still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy´s gotta be right.
Listen, l ripped everything outta there
except the rocker panels.
Come on, lrv. What the hell is that?
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
All right.
l got it for you, Randy.
ltjust came in from downtown.
- Who´s Devereaux?
- l am Mr Devereaux. Why?
l´m sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot
of cars here and it´s hard to keep track...
- You mean the car is here now?
- Oh, yeah. lt´s right outside.
They stole it right
offthe street from you, huh?
Goddamn. You´re gonna have to pay
the towing charge, you know.
l was told these things happen in New York,
but one never expects it.
Yeah, well, that´s New York.
ls this your first trip over here?
Yes. Where´s my car, please?
lt´s right over here.
You´re lucky this time. lt´s in perfect shape.
Not a scratch. You must lead a charming life.
Henri.
Je vous attendais.
(man) Let´s go!
l wouldn´t be surprised if l´d been followed.
- Listen, l´ll see you at Pop´s tonight.
- OK, babe. Take care.
(police sirens)
They got the bridge blocked off!
This is the police. You´re surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police. You´re surrounded.
Give ´em the gas!
Hold your fire!
Stop!
They´re comin´ out! Hold your fire!
Popeye. lt´s me, it´s me.
