They're coming!
Right on time!
Is this number 7 of Carbone Alley?
Impounded on 16 September 1954
the furniture of Adelina Sbaratti
My wife
...the consignee, on account of an unpaid fine of
28,000 lire
28,000 lire is the fine. Procedural fees...
interest and costs, etc.
Brings us to 50,780
Wasn't 28,000 better?
Well, are you going to pay this 50,780?
What, we didn't pay 28 and we pay 50?
-Where's the consignee?
-My wife?
She's not here
I'll take the furniture then
Come in, sir
Let's see...
A walnut table 6x4...
You made a clean sweep. It's out of my hands now
This is a court matter. Make way!
We fooled him!
He wanted Adelina Sbaratti?
That's all you're good at, but it won't get you
anywhere
You're in big trouble now
-What's he after?
- He came on Wednesday
-Who is he?
- Search me
I'm Verace, a lawyer, and you're illiterate clowns!
That was no joke, you're in big trouble
You'll see when the police come
You'll go to jail for the crime you committed!
What crime?
You violated Art. 384 of the Criminal Code!
That's what you did!
Mr Verace!
Explain it to us, we're ignorant
First you get into trouble, then you come to us
lawyers
But it was only a fine
Which you didn't pay, so they impounded your
furniture
And you came up with the smart idea of hiding it
But my friend is a bit... needy
What did they fine him for?
Selling contraband cigarettes
I'm sorry, my friend, but you're in big trouble
But it's not me, it's my wife, a mother of children!
They fined her. The furniture's hers, 
the rent's in her name
Then she'll go to jail
Don't let him get away. Pasquale, call Adelina!
Mr Verace!
Mr Verace!
Cigarettes!
English, American, Swiss!
English, American, Swiss!Who smokes?
Sir! I buy dollars!
Adelina, you're the only one 
who can persuade the lawyer
What lawyer?
The bailiff came, and a lawyer says we're in trouble
What kind of trouble?
Damn them!
Hey! Come here, boy!
- Come see the lawyer?
- And let everything bum?
You go, we'll take care of the boy
-What about my box?
- Nobody'll touch it
Damn them!
Hey, a client!That gentleman's mine
English, American, Swiss...
- But ma'am...
-Yes, I'm coming!
What he says is true. If he can't help you, he can't
help you
He wouldn't miss good business
But he may just be saying that because he's angry
I've told you once, please go away
If you let us see him, we'll give you something
Word of honour, I never saw two more deceitful
people!
You get it, I won't budge from here
- Carmelo...
- At last! Come in
Who are you? Where are you going?
- That way.
- Let's go.
You can't go in, is that clear?
- Where is he?
- Mr Verace, help us!
She can't go to jail!
I was fined for selling cigarettes
You know how long it takes to make 28,000 lire?
Days... weeks even
Out there, rain or sun
My husband's been out of work
since he was drafted. How can we get by?
Then a creep comes along and arrests you
No, wait a minute, they can't arrest her
-What?
- She's breeding!
They can't arrest her, she's breeding!
They can't arrest her, she's breeding!
They can't arrest her, get it? She's breeding!
They can't jail her for that crime. She's breeding
Have you heard? They can't arrest her
Why not?
She's breeding
Yes, she's breeding!
Yes, she's breeding!
She's breeding, she's breeding, cha-cha-cha...
I have an American specialty, painless childbirth!
- Good luck!
- Same to you!
Here they are, nice and fresh
Mark it. They're hot, they're hot!
The lawyer must know.A pregnant woman can't be
arrested
until after the baby's born
Plus 6 months for nursing
Kids are a great thing, a gift of Providence
although I never had the pleasure
Is it my fault?
I have what it takes! But we won't go into that
I'm only saying that the best thing in the world
is when a man comes home and his wife says she
wants a baby
"Heart, ungrateful heart..."
Well, what's the joke?
I'd been drafted...
No, let me tell it
We were going together and... well, it happened
"Carmelo, how can I tell Mom? "
This idiot was all happy. "Are you really sure?"
"I'll see a midwife tonight."' "But I can't get a pass"'
"If it's a definite, I'll come and sing outside the
barracks"
So that's it!
"Ungrateful Heart"' all night
I didn't sleep a wink.
We were married soon after
Mom was against it."'Adelina, I can't give you a cent"
"Carmelo's broke and I have 1 5 kids.
What if you take after me?
"Mom, we'll be careful"
You didn't keep your word and now you're
pregnant again
Yes,just look at it
I could have gone to jail
The baby's due any day... A short rest...
July, August, September, November, December
Carmelo, you'll have to get busy at Christmas
Right
Here I am
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas
- Good night! Merry Christmas!
-Thank you
Good night, Mom. Merry Christmas
All on my own... you have things to do
- Mom, I explained.
- I understand
We'll have dinner together tomorrow. 
Oh, I nearly forgot!
Granny's made some ointment for your chilblains
Do I put it on at night?
Yes, rub it on when he's in bed
Thanks, Mom. See you tomorrow
Take care.Merry Christmas again
Come and celebrate!
Amedeo's brought a big cake from Milan
They're all waiting for you
Pasquale, it's Christmas. I don't want to go to jail
I get it, you'll have a better Christmas than us
Stop that! Get moving!
Who lives here?
Adelina Sbaratti. I'm here, come in
The term's up, it's time for you vacation.
You're under arrest
What does that mean?
The doctor's certificate is on the table
If you want it, help yourself
Or come back in a few months and you'll find two of
them
- Congratulations
-Thank you
See how well he's learned? English, American, Swiss
Swiss!
How cute he is!
The cops...The cops!
Go ahead, arrest me! I have another five months
50 lire's worth of chestnuts
Sorry, huh? The usual favor...
Right, let's see
Forget it, for a few chestnuts...
Thank you
- I can't make it out
-You wrote it
The best I could
Darn reading and writing!
Delivered on October 28...I was selling prickly pears
then
Six months' nursing. October, November,
December...
Her reprieve ends in May, when cherries come out
It's January now. There's time
Carmelo, if you need any help, feel free!
Pasquale, if you need a baby, I do home catering!
Two pounds of cherries
Cherries! Cherries!
A couple of cherries for her...
-The certificate?
-The certificate!
- Another child?
- Another child
That's four. How many more?
All the ones that come!
Maria, don't be late! And take the umbrella
All right, Mom
Open wide, here comes the fuel!
Have they finished, Pasquale?
It's all gone, look!
Make me a pacifier for Caterina
Coming up
I'll make it later. Let me quiet the kids down first
Come here, kids. Pasquale's got something nice for
you
Easy now, one at a time
One for you, one for you... and we'll keep these for
later
Now be good while I make a pacifier for Caterina
Nunziatina, let me tie a bow in your hair
You must have a bow
No bow, no candy
Where's Carmelo?
He's in a bad way
With seven kids it's a regular fanfare all night
I sent him off to Mom's to get an hour's sleep
How pretty you look!
Now Pasquale will give you some more candy
Here you are
This fanfare seems to do you good, though
You're prettier than ever now, bless you!
Kids are good for me.
Some women fall apart after the first
But not me. Look... seven kids
The cough medicine, I forgot
I don't want it
You'll take it. It was bought and it has to be used
You'll take it
Come here or I'll smack you!
Not like that. Kindness gets you everywhere. Let me
try
Come out!
Come out!
- Come to Uncle Pasquale...
- Go to hell!
What, to your Uncle Pasquale? Come on now
What did he do?
He bit me... it's nothing
I'll fix him! He'll come out!
Get out from under there!
I've got him!
Hold him tight!
Don't let him go!
My name's not Adelina Sbaratti
if you don't take it
We can't throw money out of the window like that
For a tantrum! 400 lire!
Come on now, out you go! Go outside
Here, buy yourselves a lolly pop
I'll send them to school
Now come to bed like a good girl
Adelina, she has to eat something
What? She had two plates of pasta! Put her to bed
She's fast asleep already... Let's go
This is red hot
I'd keep you company but I have things to do
Off you go, and thank you.What a good father you'd
make
Pasquale! Are you crazy?
I'm sorry, I got a bit carried away
I'm sorry!
I can't, Mom, I can't! Can't you hear them?
I came here to sleep. Have a word with Don Antonio
But they have to work. I pay next to nothing a
month here
Don Antonio, will you be long?
Another 1 0 minutes, then we break for lunch
But if you go on hammering?
Don't worry, we'll let Carmelo get an hour's sleep
Thank you
Look how long he's keeping me waiting!
I'll come at 9, he says. It's 1 0:30 and he hasn't shown
At last! It took you long enough. Come on!
I've come from Porta Capuana
Come on...
- So?
- I've come from Porta Capuana
No, it's not me!This way!
Came in, hurry up!
No, over here... on the bed
You want a boy or a girl?
Anything goes, as long as it's a sure thing
That costs 50 lire more
All right
All right, ring the bell.
- Now?
-Tomorrow?
Where does your husband sleep?
- Here
Ring the bell, please.
I can't take any more!
Right, you must look after yourself
The first thing is sleep. I'll make you some herb tea
Herb tea, when my life's been hell for three years?
What a calamity...
It's always the same: get busy, the nursing term's
over!
Go to bed early! The police! Turn the light out!
And all that on a bowl of soup a day. I'm not made
of iron
Doing it to order is one thing, but this is continuous
You do look peaked
That follows
DiZZy spells, wobbly legs
And if you must know, I've fainted twice in the
street
And the more I become a wreck, the more she's at
me
How pretty she's grown, Mom. She's blossomed like
a rose
She's bleeding you dry. You've grown as ugly as an
ape
Let the rose find herself
someone to make her breed to order
I'll kill her...if anything like that happens
Carmelino...
Carmelo, give me a hand
A chicken, pasta and wine, 100 lire. What number?
Give me 89
Who wants a number? Buy a lottery ticket!
Darn it, I was dead certain this time.Two weeks!
I even made an appointment with the doctor for
the certificate
And instead I feel lousy. I guess I'm not used to it
any more
- Beat it!
-What do you mean?
I mean I was late and there's no baby
How can I help it? How can I help it?
Are you trying to send the poor girl to jail?
-You can't think that!
-We do think that!
Look at my husband, and learn!
-You can go in
-Thank you
Come in, come in
Sit down
Sorry to bother you, but I always give you fresh
cigarettes
So I thought you'd give me preferential treatment
too
Of course... And how's business?
I can't complain
What's it about?
You tell him, Carmelo, you're the man
He's shy
A doctor's like a confessor
Doctor, I...
Since we got married, it's been continuous
There's never been a break in this... current
Seven kids, and I'm still nursing
It's not my fault, Doctor.The will is there
You bet
We married for love. It's obvious the will was there
But if this goes on, who'll keep the kids?
He's out of work, I have to provide for everyone
Your wife's right
Sure, but I'm right too
We're not animals. Your wife's pretty, you're in love
but you ought to control yourself, my boy
It's not that I don't feel the urge. I do feel it
Stifle it. So you don't want any more children?
No, quite the opposite. But he doesn't work any
more
Just a minute...The urge is there
I don't understand.What is it you want?
Another child!
So you came to have your husband examined?
Yes, sir
Come over here them
Sit down here
Take your jacket off
-The urge is there
- I feel the urge too
Cross your legs
His leg reacts, it moves
What do I care if his leg moves?
You're slightly anaemic. Let's check your blood
pressure
There's nothing wrong with him, he's just very tired
You're under-nourished
Is it serious?
There's no need to worry, it's a very minor thing
- Pressure, 80
- Is that good?
No, bad. He's run down
What should he do?
You don't whip a tired horse, you put him in the
stable
Let him be for three months. He'll take treatment
eat nourishing food, and you'll have 
the baby next year
Hello, Adelina. Look at this
I brought the medicine for Carmelo
Good.What is it?
Injections, German stuff. Don't listen to the doctor
The pharmacist says this is special. After a month...
of these whoppers, Carmelo will turn into a lion!
In a month I'll be in jail
Don't say that
"Diseases of the... para... Iina... hepati..."
What does that mean?
Come here. Better you than somebody else
Adelina...
I don't want to go to jail, get it? I won't go!
You keep saying you have what it takes. Show me
- Now?
- Now!
- Here?
- Here!
Yes, sweetheart, but where's Carmelo?
At Mom's with the kids. Only the babies are here
Come on then
Oh my...
Leave off!
Do anything you like
I can't do it! I can't do it!
I want my Carmelo...
What the hell...? I don't understand you
Do you think I'm a clown? You wanted it and we'll
do it
Shame on you! Fine friend of my husband's!
But it was you!
Yes, it was me!
Are you crazy?
Oh my! Poor little girls...
The German stuff
Wake up, Mommy's taking you to jail
I'm a fool to love you. I'll go to jail and that's that!
We'll put an end to this farce... Goodbye
Keep away, don't touch me!
Goodbye, sissy!
-Which one's free?
-The first.
What are you doing? She goes to 
the maternity section
Why are you taking her away?
-What's your name?
- Nunziatina
Dear Nunziatina...
- Good morning, Mother
- Good morning, girls
Here's the pot
- A change of baby clothes
-Thank you
I know you
You're Adelina from Forcella
- And you're Fragulella
-Yes, I'm Fragulella
- And what's your name?
- Assuntina
- And you?
- PiZZocca
-What are you in for?
- Fraud
-What's your name?
- Earthquake
-What are you in for?
- Abusing the cops!
- And you, Fragulella?
- Prostitution
Aren't you going to ask me?
-What's your name?
- BigTits!
-What are you in for?
- Insulting an officer
Well done!
Come on, eat up.You've had nothing all day
- Are they fresh?
- Sure
180the cookies, plus the sub for Adelina's fine
Hair-cut and shave, 450
I've always paid 350
And the sub for the fine?
Were you looking for me?
Cleopatra, remember the sub for the fine!
Yes, I know
Don't bother, I'll pay. Give me the change
Three beers today and two orangeades yesterday
-Thank you
-Thank you, Sergeant!
He's paid the sub for the fine too
That's 40,690 lire. Do you want to count it?
Is there any hope of collecting the full amount?
40,000 lire only buys an 8-day remission of the jail
term
In a week, two weeks at most...
I'll bring you, here 2 on thistable, 300,000 lire
and even more!
Are you sure?
The people of Forcella are out of this world!
They've risen up in a gesture of solidarity
It makes you forget how filthy and ignorant they are
Be quiet, dear sister!
- Sister!
-What is it?
But it's not allowed!
Mind you're quiet
The things you make me do!
I'm sorry...
There she is!
Start singing! Tell her the kids are fine
I love her and the petition's been sent off to Rome
Mr Verace is expecting you
How are you?
Is it true full amount has been collected?
Here it is, it's even more
This sum will buy her...
A 64-day remission of the jail term
The case is closed then?
No, there's the conviction but I've applied for a
pardon
-Your name is Verace?
- Domenico Verace
I'm Bianchina Verace, his sister
I've applied to the President for a pardon, but it
takes time
How long was she sentenced to?
Four and a half months
The press can do a lot to mobilize public opinion
because unless a pardon comes at once, it's no
good
I can never do right. Why aren't you pleased?
- For a few days off jail?
- Am I the Attorney General?
You're a pig, that's what!
The fine's paid, but who'll serve the rest of the
sentence?
I hear they never grant pardons. An amnesty is
different
I have to serve the full four 1 months, but you're all
right!
- Oh come on!
- Calm down, young man
You don't know what an urge I have, it's killing me!
I can't wait for you to get out
- I've finished the treatment!
- Oh shut up!
That's just talk!When I needed facts, you went to
Mommy
You came over diZZy!
Beat it! A pardon!
Some hope! As if they cared about me in Rome!
I don't want to see you again!
What is it?
Good news, Sister!
I'm here, what is it?
What's happened?
You've been granted a pardon! You're free!
Oh my... I don't believe it... a pardon...?
The news came last night, but the Governor wanted
to make sure
A pardon!
I've been pardoned! I'm free
Fragulella, I'm free! Come here...
I'm so happy! Don't forget us when you get out
Say hello to my mother
Come and see me
If you want to leave with the first shift, be quick!
It's 1 1, there's so much to do
When's Mom coming out?
You heard the lawyer, we have to wait
Will they let her out now?
Let's hope so
Stop it!
Behave yourselves
or they won't let Mom out
When you go to jail, will you take me with you?
Mr Verace's waiting in the visitors' room,he says to
hurry
She'll be there in five minutes
As soon as we're all dressed!
It's 12 o'clock, will she have time to catch the first
shift?
- Stop it!
-There's Mom!
Idiot, you made my heart turn over
I thought it was her
Isn't this the best day of your life?
It sure is
The news took you by surprise?
No, I was ready for it
Were the kids pleased?
They were bursting with happiness
Our mother's coming back!
They were singing and dancing
I'm hungry!
I need to piss!
They're too young to understand, poor things
How will you show your gratitude to the President?
By writing him a letter, from me and my wife
There's Mom!
Stop it or I'll smack you
What can I say? I don't know anything
Mind the streetcar! Do you want to scare me to
death?
Driver, here!The car's ready
Are we going by car?!.
Come on children!
Guarantee pardon for only one thirty dollars
and the rest when the pardon comes true!
No one of you wants a pardon?!
Enrico, come here
Go see who it is
Who is it?
We're going to the port, the cigarettes have come
It's my first day of freedom
and this was my first night. I want to lie in
Yes, stay here
I'm taking the day off. See you tomorrow at the
usual place
Don't worry, Mr Verace has promised to fix me up
- Okay
- Bye!
Hurray for Mr Verace!
Ugh, you can't move even early in the morning...
What sweeties!Take it easy, fellas...
Why don't they stay home in bed, these workers?
At least on Sunday morning
In three days the concert.Two hours of sleep
guaranteed
Thank God, I'm so tired
Tomorrow morning, the Senator's funeral
I must put in an appearance
At 1 0, the Committee meeting
Lunch with the in-laws
The Americans in the evening
The morning after...
Oh yes, Father Astolfi's orphans
Then the hairdresser's
Look in at Titti's, 1 then an hour's workout
Then back to the hairdresser's
Then look in at Titti's again
Then the prize-giving of those wretched orphans
Enough, enough! Away! A clean break
Definitively
Renzo, I can't remember the color of your eyes right
now
The darling, with that serious face. He's the best
man I know
So generous, so free so unassuming
The darling, with those incredible short socks!
There he is
- Am I late?
- No, I just got here
-Where shall we go?
- No idea. You decide
It's hot in here. Mind if I open it up?
Of course not
Were you surprised I called?
No, I was expecting it
I'd have called if you hadn't
If you've time, how about a drive?
I have all the time you want
- Is that your husband?
-Yes
Where is he now?
In Stuttgart, for the EEC. He'll be away another week
How does it feel, seeing your name everywhere?
I don't even notice any more
Besides, my name is Anna, remember?
You've changed since last night, you hardly know
me
It's just that seeing you arrive took my breath away
Classy, huh?
After you took me home last night, I couldn't sleep
The things you said to me... I've never felt so
unhappy
-Why?
- Because you're right
I've lived like a puppet, deaf, blind, oblivious...
to the rights of others
I realized that while I was dancing with you
I felt alive for the first time, in your arms
What's the world coming to!
Let's close the roof
Scared someone will see you?
I said it for your sake. It could happen
If you're worried about my husband, relax
It sounds as if you mind
Nobody likes living with an addict
I didn't know
Yes, an addict. Not in the way you think, but it's
worse
He's part of the system: work, success, money
Money, success, work
You can't stop him
And nothing else exists
And are you different?
Yes, you made me realize that. Thank you, Renzo
I think I talked a lot of nonsense last night
Why, what's changed?
How many millions do you have?
What does that have to do with it?
- A lot
-You're being mean
Slow down!
Would you like to drive? Go on!
No, I don't know these cars. My limit is a Fiat 600
But this one's easy
- No, better not
- Come on, change over
It's perfect, you'll see. Does 1 20 like nothing
And it's just been serviced
The key's there
Where's the indicator? Ah, here it is
A bit of music?
Well, Renzo?
Anna, I like you a lot
But you don't think I'm sincere
I don't know... I don't know
Look, we're low on gas
That's the heat. I filled up this morning
- How much does it hold?
- 20 gallons, I guess
Enough to take mine around the world
Do you like traveling too?
The minute I can, I go far away from everything
I'm so tired of my world, the people I know
There's an oasis near Marrakesh, it's divine!
You live on sun and fruit, lots of fruit
- 1,200,000
-What?
The return fare
- Oh, Renzo, stop it!
- It's the truth
The truth is you keep turning the conversation to
money!
You know what I make a month?
I don't want to know! Don't you understand?
I like you because you're not like the robots I know
busy making money all day
You write, you're intelligent. 
I never think about money
- I swear I don't
- Because you have it
So, should I throw it away?
Yes, everything: money, cars, those Cleopatra
bracelets
I got these at the hardware store
Did you get this monument at the hardware store
too?
But that's not it.The fact is you have money in you
In me there's only emptiness.. a big emptiness
I thought you could have helped me
Where do you want to go?
We could go to my place
My villa's near here. There's a lake too
- How big is the lake?
- Small
My husband had it made to fish trout
-We'll go to the River Po
- Lovely!What is there?
Mosquitoes, one thing your husband didn't make
Sorry...
Let's go anywhere, wherever you like
As long as there's a bit of peace and quiet
There, look! That's fine
How wonderful!
"Our Jazz program continues..."
In a few days this lovely October will be over too
Not here, please. Let's go away
God!
You like me, I can tell
If you hadn't called me, who would you have called?
Nobody... I'm alone
With all the people you know?
With all the people I know
I can't tell which are your 
fingers and which are mine
This is so lovely, unbelievable...
Help me
Let's go far away, to the sun.To Rome, Naples
Yes, let's go
We'll arrive at night, in the lamplight
The still, silky water...
We'll ride in a trap and find a nice small place, just
for us
The dark sky full of stars...
And music, lots of music in the air
under our windows
Tomorrow we'll wake up late, as the sun creeps onto
the bed...
You'll take me in your arms, you'll hold me tight...
- Anna, are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing
We're on fire!
The car!
My God, what have you done?
I had to put the brakes on...
Something's burning!
The tire's burning!
Do something, you fool!The car's on fire!
Find something to put it out!
How could anybody be so dumb!
Are you crazy, with my fur? Use your jacket!
God, the whole thing's going to blow up. Get the
jack!
-What are you doing?
- I can't open it!
Jesus Christ!
The jack! Surely you know what a jack is!
You must have rammed on the brakes like a brute
These cars are delicate, they're jewels!
And you stamp on the brake like it was a truck!
- But I could have killed him!
-Who cares!
Now what are you doing?
Would you mind giving me a hand? I'm in trouble
I think it's serious
If I can be of any help.What's wrong?
I don't know, please come and take a look
What happened?
We were speeding and we suddenly had
to brake hard to swerve
It's jammed, I don't know what to do
- It's a Rolls
-Yes, the latest model
- Are you happy with it?
-Yes, no problem until now
That's quite a bump.Were you driving?
It was all so sudden. The car swerved and went off
the road
Strange, these cars are perfect
I was a fool to let a Fiat-600 driver handle it
- A colossal mistake
-You're quite right
-Would you like me to help?
- Goodness no
You see, these cars with the rim-braking system...
I prefer disc brakes, they're better
It's not the brakes, it's knowing how to drive the car
Even the Divine Comedy in illiterate hands...
Let's hope for the best
Don't worry, the damage can easily be fixed
Haven't we met before?
You look familiar too
I guess we met in Casorate, with my husband, at the
Martin's
Is your husband in Milan?
No, he's in Stuttgart on EEC business
He'll be away a week. Thank God, with this disaster
You'd better call a mechanic
Definitely, that one is absolutely hopeless
I can turn around and drive you home
- I'm Giorgio Carate
- Pleased to meet you
I'm going home. This gentleman'staking me
We'll send a mechanic
Keep an eye on it, do me a favor. Thanks!
"Milan Stock Exchange rates"'
"Molini Certosa 2700"'
"Distillati 2490"'
"Eridania 2603..."
Is this a Rolls Royce?
Does it really do 150?
More than a Ferrari!
What do you want?
100 lire
Hello? Yes, I was in the bathroom
No, I can't today... Sorry, I'm busy...
Mind where you put your feet, you'll scare them!
Oh, the Bolognese! Come in
Darling! Sweetheart!
You beautiful doll, you look wonderful!
Quiet, don't shout!
- Come in the other room
- I can't. Later
I have a few things for you. I just wanted to see you
To kiss you, to touch you..
Mara, wait! Listen, I have to go to the Ministry
You queen!You empress!
When I'm in love, I sweat!
Use and discard...
Use and discard...
They're very practical
Wait for me tonight. Make me die, I'm counting on
it!
Think of me, Bolognese
-What's got into you?
- I want to die there!
Now I've got to be strong, I've got to resist!
- How can I resist?
- Don't shout!
Wear this tonight
I want you to dress like a little girl
Are you crazy?
You can call me uncle
You're nuts, you Bolognese. Do you get a kickout of
it?
I need a lot of tenderness, Mara
Next time I'll wear short pants
You'll sing me a lullaby and I'll fall asleep in your
arms
Now I'll hurry to the Ministry or my father will kill
me
May I call him?
Bologna, Miss, very urgent! Bologna 543221
This is 577000
Jesus, it's easy! 5-7-7 and three Zeroes. Six numbers
It'll take her till Christmas
I'll stay here tonight...
Hello? Yes, Dad, it's me
Yes, I went
No, the permit's not ready
Yes, I went to seethe Under Secretary
You'll see, I'll settle it tonight. It only needs
stamping
But I'm not an idiot!
I won't let you go!
Look at you, there isn't one thing wrong with you
Make a face or I can't go
No, don't make faces, it turns me on even more!
Where's your college?
At Anagni, but the head-office is in Lombardy.
- How many hours do you study?
- 1 2
My-oh-my!
Five hours of meditation and prayer, seven of study
When do you get time off?
Recreation after lunch, and an hour in the evening
My nephew's with the friars. They say the rosary at
midnight
The Capuchins have that rule
No, thank you
Aren't you allowed to? I saw a bishop with a pipe
once
It's forbidden at college
You give me the urge to come to confession
in this lovely moonlight
I couldn't hear it, I'm not a priest yet
I take my vows in two years
You're dressed like a priest
But I'm not
I love black, I wear it on top and underneath...
When the Council's over, will priests be allowed...to
marry?
I don't think so
American priests have children
But I don't like that
Priests should be like the moon:
nobody knows what it is
They're men with a religious vocation
My nephew's vocation was beaten into him by his
mother!
You like it?
Yes, but I'm free decide for myself
There's plenty of time before my vows. I'll pray to
my saint
-Who's that?
- Saint John
I have one nobody knows. Saint Maurillo
- Do you know him?
- No
I need one who doesn't get pestered, who has time
for me
I ask him to let me make lots of money
- Does he answer you?
- Pretty well
But...I don't like my job
-What do you do?
- Manicurist
But I pick my clients, respectable people who pay
well
I want to buy my father some land
The hands I've seen! I can judge people by them
Let me see yours
You're level-headed and you like sport
I used to play inside right...
There's a great destiny here
- I can tell you're kind
- How can you tell?
By everything
You're predestined! My, how straight that line is!
You can ask anything of life
I'd like to go out with you
Yes, arm-in-arm!
Think of the neighbors, think of your grandmother!
And dressed like a priest!
But I have a suit. It's a bit old...
We'll go to the sea
I'd like that, now that it's not so crowded
We'll stay there all day, I'll bring some sandwiches
We'll see... we'll see
Oh pussy! Come here...
I ought to leave tomorrow, but I can be a day late
When will you be back?
At Christmas, to see my grandparents
I'll think it over tonight about going to the sea
I wonder who he belongs to? He often comes to see
me
It was so nice here
I'll wait for you
This one will be here for some time
He's come from Bologna on business
I'll wait here until dawn
Take the cat
- Bye!
- Good night
Why aren't you in bed yet?
I'm going, Gran! Excuse me...
- Good evening, ma'am
- I don't know you
You know me now
I don't know you, nor does my grandson
Umberto, go to bed!
Good night, Miss
I'll have a wall built here
Thank goodness he's leaving tomorrow
I won't leave unless you apologize to the young
lady!
Over my dead body!
- I'm sorry, Miss
- Don't mention it
Leave the boy alone
He's not like the men who come to your house
This boy's a saint!
Only respectable people come to my house!
The one at the door now is Cavaliere Rusconi's son!
A fine thing!
Government deputies come to my house too!
And Tommasi, the pasta producer
I see you eat Tommasi pasta
I won't any more
Tomorrow I'll send a petition around, everybody will
sign it
You'll leave the building.We're tired of this coming
and going
You're a scandal. Yesterday I counted four men!
Do you want to put a meter on me?
Three yes and four no? My client are quiet,
well-behaved people
You'll go to hell, mark my words. Shame on you, I'll
report you!
Stop it, Gran!You're an old goose!
You... old...witch!What does she want from me?
Vincenzo! Come away!
Her and that other old goat!
She'll report me, she'll send meto hell. Jesus!
Listen to this one
All right! All right! I heard you!
At last! I was starting to worry
Why ring like that?
- Gorgeous!
- Oh come in
I thought there'd been a gas leak
Pussy... Is he new?
I'll show that old witch.I'll fix that boy, you'll see!
What boy? What old witch?
Next-door. She hates me talking to her grandson!
It's crazy! As if I'd go with a priest!
He isn't even 1 8
We're talking about God and she yells I'll go to hell
She's given me a headache
Take no notice of her: do no evil, fear no evil
She says she'll tell my landlady
Landladies are sympathetic, they just put the rent
up
I know, as if I didn't pay enough!
But I'll make Granny sorry!
You have to understand
Come here, come to Uncle
As if I felt like making love!
Come on, Mara. We'll go to bed and cuddle up
together
Like good children. We won't even talk
- I need to talk!
- Okay, but in bed
I'm too mad, I'd be like a stone
Be honest, am I a scandal? Do I do it on the terrace?
I'm willing to go out on the terrace.
Like Nero looking at Rome
Don't I always ask everybody... not to shout?
To talk quietly? When you yell you sound like a
donkey
Because I'm different
I love you, I think you're perfect.
Do you love me?
- Here...
- I love you
- Let's run away together
-Who's chasing us?
I don't like you going with other men, I'm jealous
Marry me then
What for? Why don't you come to Bologna for a
month?
I won't budge from here.The old witch would love
that
In fact I'll buy this apartment she'll be stuck with me
forever
Let's do it here, it would be heavenly
We'll turn the lights out and open the refrigerator
Look what a nice cosy light
I'll write her a letter, I want to let off steam
I saw a terrific show in Paris
Black striptease! We need music
This is scented. I'm not sending her scented paper
- Let's turn the lights out
- I've got to write
Just for a minute
Will you correct if for me?
I don't want her to find any mistakes
Sure
The woman's shapely leg slowly comes into the
light...
What's he up to?
The light creeps up slowly...
very very slowly...
It takes your breath away. I was really turned on...
They have time to waste!
Turn the light on!
Umberto!
You won't see me again! You 
treat me like a doormat!
You're not the only woman around, 
I can find any number
Sit down and be good
You think I'm a slave to sex
but I have a soul too, remember that
Look, there's only a hair between 
a devil and a saint!
My life's about to change. I'm going home to find a
wife
Sure, you must get married
Dear Madam...
"Dear"?!.
My father may call,
I left him your number in case it was urgent
Fake a man's voice and say I'm out
Goodbye
I said I'm sorry. Do you want to hit me over the
head?
This isn't a hotel, you know. 
Get up, I have to go shopping
Mara, last night I came to Piazza Navona
I sat on a bench and looked up at your window
Then I couldn't hold out any longer 
and I went with a..
-Whore
-Yes
Can't you miss even one day?
We didn't do anything, I swear
I suddenly felt something inside
and I shouted to her, go away!
- She started insulting me
- She was right
But I paid her anyway!
They have their self-respect too, you have to
understand
Come on, get up
Thank you
Couldn't you put a carpet down here?
A soft red runner... I'll buy one for you
Listen, I have an hour before I see the Under
Secretary
We've never been together in the morning
Just for an hour, okay?
Oh all right
- Don't undo it!
- Quiet, the old witch will hear!
You give me a bad name
- I want to undress you
- Be quiet!
You're a vision!You know what I'd like?
To see you in a fur coat, nude, in the sunshine
Are you nuts, in this heat?
Hello?... Oh,Vani from Venice!
Sure I remember. Short, with a moustache. The bass
player
You're the bass player, right? I remember
Try tomorrow. Sure I'll give you a grade, I promised
Come on, you beautiful doll
I'll set my family against the old witch, there's seven
of us
Eight with me, darling
- Are you going to be all day?
- It's hard and I'm shaking
Let me see if they're up
Hey, look at that!
He's taken his cassock off. The old 
witch will be furious
The boy's got character. Come and look
Well done!
Hi!
I'll shoot him!
Please, it turns me off if you laugh.
This is serious
The best thing in the world
- You're not in!
- I'll take a peep
- It's Gran!
- Don't open it!
She looks out of her mind!
I'll go
-Who is it?
- Open the door!
- But who is it?
- Giovanna Villenzone
- Never heard of her
- Umberto's grandmother
Well?
I want to speak to you... just for a minute
I must speak to you
It's too early for visitors
Come in, ma'am
What is it?
- It's all over!
- Don't cry
You've ruined me, you've ruined my family
If you stop crying we can put everything right
Please stop crying, ma'am.
He was an angel, respectful, obedient, and he's lost
his head
Calm down, we'll fix it
It's too late. He's put brilliantine on his hair
He took his cassock off... it's time to put a stop on
it!
...where's the window?!!?.
Please calm down, ma'am
Calm down
- Mr Rusconi
- Pleased to meet you
Do you know Umberto studied all the time?
He even read at night.You know he could have
become Pope?
He will, he will
Come into the parlor, ma'am
-Thank you
- Don't mention it
Givethe lady a Fernet
Or would you prefer something sweet?
I have Strega, aniseed.. whatever you like
He refuses to go back to the seminary
We'll make him go back, I'll see to it
He says you're a saint and I'm a witch
You can go now, Rusconi. Granny's feeling better
Wait for me in the other room. Use the phone if you
like
- Did I disturb you?
- No
The gentleman's very kind. He's from Emilia
- I have relations there
-That's nice
Listen, you may tell your grandson whatever you
like
By all means tell him the truth
I have, but he doesn't believe me
- Keep trying
-Thank you. Umberto's parents
have such great hopes in him.
My daughter has a weak heart.
You know what a son means
- But I want a son too
- Good girl
First I have to put some money by, for his security
You know what? I'll make a vow, they always work
for me
If Umberto goes back to the seminary, I'll go a week
without
You know what
That's very generous of you
A week! And when I say something, I mean it
I'll buy some candles and keep them lit day and
night
You'll go straight to heaven, ma' am
- It's a sacrifice for me
- I can imagine
But I'll do it gladly
I'll lose about... 200,000 lire
Goodness, you earn that much?
I could make more if I wanted, but I only see who I
like
You're right
Who's speaking? Yes, this is Miss Mara's home
No, she's gone away. She'll be back at Christmas
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
-Who was it?
- A Sicilian... see soon.
No, come and talkto the lady. Like a Strega?
-Where are you going?
- I'll be back
Sorry I interrupted you
Don't mention it
This girl is an angel
Yes, she's good. See you later
No. Pourthe lady another drink
Goodness no, my head's going round
You know I never had any grandparents?
Strange
I wish I'd had a granny like you. And you?
I have three grandparents
No!
Yes. Goodbye
I'm glad I met you
So am I
Don't slam the door!
Where were you born?
We're all from Lucania
I'm from Anticoli... Anticoli Romano
Can I help you?
Yes, look, I'd like six of these nice candles
Hey, what are you doing there?
Come in!
- How much?
- 1,800 lire
- Any discount?
- No
-Where have you sprung from?
- I was just passing
Can I buy you a present?
This would suit you
How much is this?
18,000 lire
What do I do with it?
What a question! Keep it as a memento
Wear it when you're a priest
You're in league with Gran
She's an angel, leave her out of it
Pay at the desk
Last night I had a vision... Saint Maurillo
What were you thinking of?
You know I could be your mother?
Come on, try this on
This would really suit you!
You weren't born for those clothes
I fell for an officer once, his uniform really turned
me on
When he put on civilian clothes
he looked like a plucked chicken
Must you put them there?
Don't you have any faith? You know who they're
for?
Sure
Better put them out now though
You're right
- Do you have any Coca Cola?
- Yes
- And eggs?
- Yes
-What day is it today?
-Thursday
We'll surface on Saturday, we'll stay put till them
The phone!
My father's due to call
-What is it?
-The blinds!
Ma'am!
-Who is it? Gran?
- No, the wind
Out of the way
He wants to join the Foreign Legion. He's packing!
We must stop him, he's gone mad!
I'm coming... Rusconi! Come here!
Help me climb over
Come on!
- Give it to me!
- No
Let me be! Naughty boy!
What are you up to?
Tell him I'm not a liar, that I told him the truth
Your gran told the truth
The whole truth
Why do you want to make me feel guilty?
I never have before
The seminary is a secure life. Food, a bed, and you're
out...
of this wicked world! I'd be a nun if I had another
life
Give me the case!
You're hurting, Umberto!
I want to go away!
Rusconi! Come on out!
Don't just stand there, come on!
Come on, hurry!
What are you up to, boy?
Give me that case! Come on!
Mr Rusconi...
-Villenzone
- Pleased to meet you
- Sit down
-Thank you
You tell him that I wasn't lying
That nobody should be trusted except 
parents and grandparents
Is it true you make more
than a million a month?
It's true
Hear that? He wouldn't believe me, he said I made it
up
But keep it to yourself or the 
tax-man will hear about it
And try telling him the family 
eats most of your money!
The train leaves at 5
We'll take him to the station. Rusconi has his car
If we go now there's a bus
There's a bus, I've seen it
Umberto understands the situation. Don't you, boy?
I'm not a boy!
He's right
What are you crying for?
You people are always crying
Yes, son, cry
The Lord answered my prayers...
Thank you, ma'am... thank you!
Thank you, ma'am... thank you!
There they are!
After you, Reverend
I'm so happy! You should be happy 
too, you did a good deed
Yes, my conscience is clear
Who cares about the soccer match!
Close the blinds
I won't budge from here, I'll stay 
in your bed forever!
I'll put roots down!
Don't shout
Put a record on. Undress, I'll 
watch you from here
We can't!
We have to wait a week
What...?
I'm sorry, I can't help it
What do you mean?
Don't look like that, try to understand
I made a vow
Understand?!
I'll start crying too now
You want to drive me crazy
But sweetheart, a vow is a vow
It's all over between us!
A week is soon over
You won't see me again! I'm a responsible person,
not a child!
Can't you make a sacrifice?
It'll be even better after. Come on, 
I'll fix you a coffee
Forget coffee! Here's your wallet back
And the tie! And the handkerchief!
But why? Don't be like that
I drove 300 miles
Be serious!
I am serious. It's you who isn't serious
Came on...
Do you feel up to committing sacrilege?
If you're not scared, come on!
But I'll be like a block of marble.
It'll be your responsibility
You could have made the vow for next month.
You knew I was here
Yes no, yes no since yesterday.
It's bad for one's health!
Bologna!
Yes, this is 577000. Bologna?
Yes, it's me, Dad
We have to wait awhile longer, it still needs
stamping
No...
I'm flying back tonight
No...
I've done everything I had to do
I even handed out the tips
But you have to tip them in advance, Dad!
Come here
No, I'm going
Keep me company...He'll get you the permit
Don't be like that
Come on, Augusto, come here...
