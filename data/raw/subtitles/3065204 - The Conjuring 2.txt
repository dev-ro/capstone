(BIRDS CHIRPING)
LORRAINE: After everything we've seen,
there isn't much that rattles
either of us anymore.
But this one...
This one still haunts me.
Two months prior to our involvement,
the Lutz family had fled their home
in the middle of the night,
claiming that the house was haunted.
The Church had reached out to us for help.
They wanted to see
if we could confirm the activity
that had been reported by the Lutzes.
- (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
- Mm-hmm.
Okay. We ready?
Then let's get started.
I'd like you to sit quietly
and close your eyes.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Envision yourself in a halo
of glowing white light.
It will protect you.
LORRAINE: The year before
the Lutzes moved in,
a young man named Ronny DeFeo
had brutally murdered
his entire family in this house.
We'd hoped to discover if the killings
had been motivated purely by anger
or if, as Ronny DeFeo testified in court,
he had been under the influence
of something demonic.

No way.
If my mum ever found out, I'd be dead.
So don't get caught, you priss.
Here, hold this.
Gotta give you back
the spirit board that we made.
I think I'll let Keith French kiss me.

(WOMAN ON PHONE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
No. I talked to them,
and they put me through to you.
WOMAN: (ON PHONE) Please keep calm...
I am being calm.
Well, I don't understand
why you can't help me.
No.
No. He hasn't paid a penny
of child maintenance for three months.
- We're home!
- I see. That's bloody brilliant.
- JOHNNY: Hi, Mum!
- You have a good afternoon as well.
(SIGHS)
PEGGY: Janet.
Are things not bad enough around here,
that I've got to get a call
from your headmistress
who says that you was caught smoking?
I wasn't! I wasn't smoking. I promise.
- Did you get the biscuits?
- Did you just not hear me?
I talked to Mrs. More on the telephone.
How can you stand there
and lie to me like that?
I'm not lying!
Yes, she is! It's all over the school.
She was smoking with Camilla.
Shut up! You are such a liar, Johnny!
(STAMMERS) Mum! You said
we would get me some...
No, Billy. I didn't get
any bloody biscuits
because we don't have any bloody money!

You better quit messing with that

Well, I've been meaning
to quit smoking anyway.
- Margaret?

Have you got your
school uniform for tomorrow?
Yes, Mum. I'm getting it.
PEGGY: Johnny, did you brush your teeth?
JOHNNY: I did it already.

Camilla and I made it at school.
Ugh. That doesn't look right.
It really works, I swear.
We already asked it all sorts of stuff.
Come on, I'll show you.
All right.
What should I ask?
I don't know. Whatever you want.
Okay.
My sister and I want to know...
Are there any spirits here
that want to communicate with us?
(SIGHS)
Is Dad ever coming home?
Are there any spirits here

I don't think you should

God knows I had my share
of fags at school, didn't you?
PEGGY: Oh, lots.
But it's not what she did that bothers me.
It's that, she don't listen
to what I say anymore, Pegs.
PEGGY N.: Just a phase, isn't it?
I mean, I can punish her,
but then I feel guilty
because I know it's not really her fault.
She loves her dad and she took it
very hard when he left. Poor thing.
But I can't just let it go either, can I?
I'm loath to ask, but have you
told Richard about it?
I would, if I ever saw him.
(SCOFFS) Sod.
Now, it's like I'm having to do both jobs.
I'm half the mum I was before.
I'm just rubbish, Peggy.
You are not, Peggy.

(SHOW THEME PLAYING)
We are back with real life ghost hunters,
Ed and Lorraine Warren,
talking about their experiences
at the Amityville house.
And now we're gonna talk to my next guest,
Dr. Steven Kaplan, who says that the
investigations the Warrens conducted
into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.
Why is that?
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.
- But that hasn't stopped...
- That's never been proven.
Yes, it has.
The Lutz family made everything up so
they could profit off of all the publicity.
That's just not true.
Look, we see this all the time.
It's very easy to sit on the outside
and pick apart their story.
But it's something very different to have
been there and experienced it for yourself.
(LAUGHS) I don't need to go to the moon to
know that it's not made out of green cheese.
Listen, Ed Warren's never seen a house
that he didn't think was haunted.
And by the time his wife is done
blowing smoke and ringing bells
they've got everybody else
believing in ghosts, too.
What exactly are you a doctor of, anyway?
(SIGHS) Come on, Warren.
Try and show a little class, will you?
I'm not gonna show class to somebody
who's sitting here telling
lies about my wife and me.
- Be careful who you call a liar.
- What are you gonna do about it?
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)
We go on these shows to inform people.
But every time I open my mouth,
another one of these little...

Oh, for God's sake.

I'll ask him to call on you.
WOMAN: (ON TV)
...to us and tell us that...
There are still some honest
people left in the world.
And she said, what happened was,
that she was at the grocery store.
She left her wallet there,
at the grocery store.
It had money in it, a lot of money.
And she thought, "Well,
that's that. It's gone."
She thought someone
was just gonna pick it up.
That's it, that's that.
But just to see what she could do,
she went back to the
grocery store and sure enough.
Some honest woman had picked up the wallet
and returned it to the manager there.
She got everything back.
She got her money.
She got everything that was in the purse.

Mrs. Hodgson.
Yes?
My name's Kent Allen.
We're with the television
news program Wide Angle.
I was hoping to have a word with you about
the disturbance at your home last week.
How'd you find out about that?
The police constables filed
an incident report. It's...
Well, it's raised a few eyebrows.
I'd rather not have my business
spread all over the telly,
if you don't mind. Good day!
Is it still happening? Because if it is
getting your side of the story out
might be your best chance of finding help.
ALLEN: (ON MIKE) This thing on? Okay.
Behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house
in Ponders End, North London,
is a family living in a nightmare.
HAZEL: I look up, and through the window,
plain as day, I see the younger girl,
Janet, being thrown around in the air
like she was floating.
So we run back inside and sure enough
there's little toy LEGO bricks
flying all around the room.
One of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood.
CONSTABLE HEEPS:
I saw the chair slide by itself,
across the floor,
a distance of several feet.
I checked the chair for wires,
but could find nothing to explain it.
ALLEN: Maurice Grosse is an
engineering consultant
and has been investigating these claims
for the Society of Psychical Research.
Well, I don't think there's
any doubt about it at all.
The sheer number of documented incidents
in this case is absolutely staggering.
But, Anita Gregory, a parapsychologist and
lecturer at the Polytechnic of North London,
is not convinced.
Our principal characters here
are all children.
And children can be
very ingenious pranksters.
At the center of these frightening
activities is 11-year-old Janet Hodgson.
I recently interviewed Janet
and her 14-year-old sister, Margaret.
What happened next will astonish you.
How does it feel
living in a haunted house?
I don't know.
You don't get used to it.
You see, we was just a normal family
before all this.
It's been getting worse
since Mr. Grosse started talking to it.
ALLEN: How do you mean?
Like, asking it questions.
Saying knock twice for "yes"
and one for "no."
That sort of thing.
I wonder what would happen
if we tried talking to it now?
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there
who wishes to communicate?
I say again, is anybody there?
ALLEN: Nothing.
Well, it isn't a jukebox, is it?
(JANET GRUNTING SOFTLY)

The family's reached out
to the Church for help?
Yes.
But truthfully, we've been

The case has turned into
a media circus over there.
They're calling it "England's Amityville."

So, what do you want us to do?
We'd like you to fly to London
for three days to act
as our unofficial eyes and ears.
Now, you don't have to do anything.
If it is a hoax, you just
turn around and leave.
But if it's not...
Then there is a family in London
that desperately needs our help.
(SIGHS)
ED: Thank you for your faith in us.
- All right. Well, just let me know.
- Okay.
I told him we'd talk about it.
(SIGHS)
There's nothing to talk about.
Honey, you heard him.
They don't want us to get involved.
Just observe and report back.
There have always been cases
we've turned down.
There has never been a family
that we've refused to help.
I had a vision in Amityville.
(GASPS)
It was the same one I had seven years ago.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
I had a premonition of your death.
- (GROANS)
- (SCREAMS)
Wait. That's why you locked
yourself away for eight days?
You saw my death?
You've seen it, too.
The demon in your painting is real.
We have both seen the same inhuman spirit.
It's a warning. If we keep doing this,
you are going to die.
Your visions are a gift from God.
And if God is showing you my death,
then he's doing it for a reason.
Maybe you're meant
to prevent it from happening.
Come on.
We don't run from fights.
(SIGHS)
If we go...
If we do this...
You have to promise me
that we're just there to observe.
If anything turns out
dangerous in any way,
we're gonna tell the Church,
and we're gonna get out.
Promise me.
Promise me, Ed.
I promise.
(CHOIR SINGING CAROL)
Mr. and Mrs. Warren, I'm Maurice Grosse.
Thank you so much for coming.
I believe you're gonna be staying
at the Hodgsons' house. Is that right?
ED: Always better to be in the mix.
MAURICE: Oh, yeah. I agree.
- (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
- (BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
PEGGY: You didn't have to do this.
- So kind of you.
- It was a complimentary...
MAURICE: This is it.
PEGGY: Thank you very much.
- VIC: How you doing? You all right?
- I'm all right. How are the kids?
VIC: Yeah. They're fine.
MAURICE: Here we are.
(COUGHS)
There we go.
Ed, we've managed to capture
some amazing things.
I think you'll be very
impressed when you see.
ED: Great. I'd like to listen
to those tapes again, too.
You've got some really
interesting stuff in there.
MAURICE: Vic Nottingham. Hi, Vic.
How are you? Ed Warren.
Hello, Ed.
How are you?
And this is Peggy, Peggy Hodgson.
- Nice to meet you. Ed Warren.
- How do you do?
- This is my wife, Lorraine.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, I'll be off then, Peg.
Will you tell the kids I said hello?
Yeah. Of course, I will. Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.
- You too, hon.
- So, here we are, Peggy.
- All right. Do come in.
PEGGY: It's just me and Janet here now.
My other kids are staying with them.
This is where the girls used to sleep,
but we don't use it anymore.
Why not?
Well, most of the activity
centered in this room.
We were quite afraid
that someone might get hurt,
which is why we keep it locked.
I understand that Janet has levitated.
Did that happen in here as well?
- Yeah, more than once.
- Yeah.
We've got photographs of that as well.
ED: I'd like to hear Mrs. Hodgson's story
from her, if you don't mind.
PEGGY: The neighbors donated them
and I hung them up,
hoping they'd keep things
from moving around.
Has it worked?
No. We can hear it all night.
(SIGHS)
(SWING CREAKS)
Hi, there. I'm Lorraine.
Mind if I have a seat?
Do you know why I'm here?
Well, your mom has told me
about what's been going on
and I'm here to help, if I can.
Would you like to talk about it?
You know, when I was about your age,
um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital
and I saw an angel.
Yeah.
It was standing next to
a little boy's bed.
It was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped.
And it looked right at me.
Of course, my mom and the nurses
did not believe me,
but I knew it was real.
Look, I know how it is.
I know what it's like to lose your friends
because you're different.
But I also know that
one person can change everything.
And you just have to open up to them.
How did you know you could trust
the people you opened up to?
I didn't.
Sometimes I got hurt.
And it took a long time,
but I finally found someone
who believed me.
What did you do then?
I married him.
I'm just so tired.
I can't sleep here.
I used to go to the medical room at school
and they let me sleep there
because I was so worn out.
But now I can't even do that.
Everyone's afraid of me.
I got no friends.
No place I can go to.
It makes me feel like I'm not normal.
You know, whatever is doing this to you
wants you to feel this way.
But why?
Because that's what makes it stronger.
PEGGY: Around the time this all started,
Janet started waking up here
in the middle of the night.
This is the spot that Janet said
Bill Wilkins died, right here.
- (SIGHS)
- Where'd you get it from?
Uh...
My ex-husband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in.
If you don't mind me asking...
Uh, is your ex-husband
still in the picture?
Nope.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Any chance of reconciliation?
He had twins with a woman
from round the corner.
So I'm gonna take that as a "no."
- Yeah, it's been a lot to deal with.
- Hmm.
He took all the music the day he left.
I know it must feel like that sometimes...
No. I mean, literally.
He took all the records.
My kids used to love listening
to his Elvis collection.
- They've been through so much.
- Hmm.
And now, all this is happening on top.
Yeah. The timing isn't a coincidence.
Negative entities often
feed off emotional distress.
They like to kick you when you're down.
That hardly seems fair.
No, it really isn't.
LORRAINE:
Do you know when the voice is gonna speak?
Sometimes.
And when it does, does it feel
like it's coming from inside you?
No.
More like it's coming from behind me.
Like I'm being used.
Does it ever say things just to you?
That only you can hear?
What does it say?
It said it wants to hurt you.
When did it say that?
Right now.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
PEGGY: Do we really need that?
ED: We'd like to be
able to prove to the Church
that she's not making the voice herself.
So, by holding the water in her mouth,
we'll be able to show
that it's not some form of ventriloquism.
Does she have to be in the chair?
Just...
It makes me sick to see her
sitting there like that.
We know it's hard, but the spirit
has shown an attachment to this spot.
It'll be easier for Ed to contact it
if she's sitting there.
You'll be all right.
(SIGHS)
You ready for this?
I guess so.
- (EXHALES)
- It's December the 21 st, 1977.
This is Ed and Lorraine Warren,
sitting with Peggy and Janet Hodgson.
Also present is Maurice Grosse.
All right. Let's get started.
(EXHALES)
If there's something here that would
like to communicate with us,
we're all ears. Speak up.
What do you want
with this girl and her family?
It says it won't talk with you
all looking at me like this.
Strange! I wonder why not?
It's not been shy about
talking up until now.
How about if we all turn our backs?
Think it'll speak if we do that?
Maybe.
Well...
Let's try this again.
(SIGHS)
So what do you think, Bill?
We've given you your privacy.
Now come on out and talk to us.
(HEAVY BREATHING)
(RUMBLING)
(GROWLING)
BILL: Here I come.
Am I talking to the spirit
that's oppressing this family?
BILL: Is that what I am?
Is that what I'm doing?
Yes.
And I have come to put a stop to it.
Do you know who I am?
BILL: Ed.
(SIGHS)
Eddie.
Edward.
Ed is fine.
Your father called you Edward.
Not true.
My father called me Ed,
just like everybody else.
(BILL LAUGHING)
(BILL ROARS AND LAUGHS)
(SIGHS) Come on, Bill.
You're not a psychiatrist
and I'm not here to talk about my father.
Let's get down to business,
what do you say?
Hmm?
Why don't you
just leave these people alone?
BILL: Because this is my house!
It's not your house.
BILL: Yes, it is.
I come here to see my family,
but they're not here now.
That's because you're dead.
If your family did live here,
they're long gone now.
(BILL GRUNTING)
BILL: Where are they?
I don't know.
If I did, maybe I could help you.
BILL: I don't need your help.
Then why don't you just move on?
BILL: I don't believe in that.
Why not, hmm?
What would be so wrong
with going to heaven?
BILL: I am not
a heaven man!
Well, I got news for you, Bill.
You see, I don't care what you believe in.
(JANGLES)
You see this?
(BILL GROANING)
BILL: Help... it... let... go.
Help... It... Let... Go!
(BILL GROANING)
ED: Are you sensing a presence?
LORRAINE: No, just the opposite.
I'm not sensing anything.
We could be looking
at hysterical neurosis.
That would explain
the multiple personalities
and hallucinations.
That doesn't feel right, either.
Well...
I can't explain it.
My heart is telling me to believe them.
I heard that voice with my own ears,
but all I can sense is their own fear.
I can't seem to see beyond that.
(SIGHS)
I don't think I can sleep
this far away from you.
Well, you're gonna.
It'll give you something
to look forward to when we get home.
Oh, love. I wish you wouldn't do that.
It helps me sleep.
At least I know I'm not going anywhere.
(CHUCKLES)
I didn't smoke, Mum.
Eh?
That day with Camilla at school.
I was holding the cigarette,
but I wasn't going to take
a puff. I swear.
I just wanted to look cool
in front of her.
It was stupid.
Oh, love.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Oh, darling.

Janet.
Get it off her! Please get it off her!
(GASPS)
PEGGY: What was that?
There was someone in here!
I saw him with me own eyes.
- He did this to my girl.
- (JANET SOBS)
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
GRAHAM: This is the bite wound
Janet received the first night.
It's faded a bit here,
but you can still make it out.
Wow. That's pretty distinctive.
Two missing teeth.
MAURICE: That's right. And it's too big
for one of the children.
You think this was the spirit?
This Bill Wilkins?
I tracked down the home owner.
And it turns out,
the owner's father lived there.
His name was William Wilkins and he died
of a hemorrhage in the brain in that chair.
Everything she said is true.
All public information, by the way.
She could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor.
LORRAINE: And what about the claims
that Janet has been teleporting
around the house in her sleep?
About as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed.
Were any of you there when it happened?
No. But I have pictures of that too.
Yeah. There you go.
I set my camera up in the girls' room
and then waited downstairs
with the remote control.
And fired it off whenever
I heard any commotion.
I have to admit.
The way her knees are bent,
the upright position of her body.
It looks like she's just jumping.
What are you saying?
I mean, you were there last night.
You saw it with your own eyes.
Well, Peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking Janet.
But she teleported herself into a room
locked from the outside,
for goodness' sake.
And what about her voice?
How do we explain that?
I think the first time
she was making that voice
it was in front of television cameras.
And she couldn't do it with water
in her mouth until you looked away.
So she could have spit it out,
taken another sip before you turned back.
Last year, I was conned by a Welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons.
(SCOFFS) Honestly,
I don't know what was worse,
the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them.
The demons are worse.
But you must admit, it is suspicious.
You sincerely believe
that she's faking everything?
And what about Peggy?
She's just using the whole
thing as an excuse
to get better housing from the council.
She's already applied!
Look, I'm not saying it's a hoax.
Sometimes, what we do
requires a leap of faith.
To believe when nobody else will.
ANITA: So you really do believe them?
Yes. We do.
But the Church can't do
anything without proof.
That's what we need.
Right, listen. I'll make
some telephone calls,
see if I can get hold of some
video recording equipment.
In the meantime, Ed and I can be
spending time with Peggy and the kids,
because they need to be a family again.
Hi, Mom! We're back!
PEGGY: What are you doing back?
What's all this, then?
Mr. and Mrs. Warren bought us some vinyls.
They got us an Elvis record!
PEGGY: Oh, Blue Hawaii.
Hope you don't mind.
A little American culture.
Not at all!
- BILLY: Janet!
- JANET: Billy.
I missed you.
Hey, guys, I missed you.
So, have any of you ever been
bothered by a bully?
Pete, at school.
He's always picking on Billy.
And, dear, tell me, what do
you do when that happens?
(STAMMERS) They stick up for me.
Good, because the spirit in this house
- is a lot like that bully.
- Yes.
ED: And he's got it in for Janet.
So you guys gotta stick up for her,
the same way they stick up for you.
Family sticks together.
This, on the other hand, is a lost cause.
Oh, bloody hell.
We've had all sorts of things stop working
- for no reason at all.
- Mmm.
We're gonna have music in here
one way or another.
Whose guitar is that?
Oh, it was Dad's,
but he said I could have it.
Yeah, do you mind?
No.
(ED SIGHS AND CLEARS THROAT)
I'm a little rusty,
so you gotta promise not to laugh.
(ALL CHUCKLING)

(GIGGLING AND APPLAUDING)
Thank you very much.
(GRUNTS)
(SCOFFS)
It's so small and light. (CHUCKLES)
JANET: Why do you do this?
Help people like us?
When you were little, did you ever
worry that there might be something
hiding under your bed at night?
Yeah? Well...
My bed actually had something under it.
Yeah.
Something grabbed my hand
and yanked me right to the floor.
It was too dark to see under there, but
let me tell you, I ran out of there so fast.
You know what my dad did?
He dragged me right back into the room
and told me I had to face my fears.
And I was scared to death.
But then I remembered
what this nun had told me in catechism.
"God will be there for all who need."
So, I grabbed this crucifix
out from my nightstand, right?
And I tell whatever's under there
that it better leave,
or God was gonna kick its butt.
(CHUCKLES)
Best thing my dad ever did for me.
Of course he only did it
because he really didn't believe me.
It took me years
to finally find someone who did.
And you know what I did then?
You married her?
So you've heard this story before?
(CHUCKLES)
All right.
PEGGY: How you getting on in here?
Hey. We're done here.
Fixed the closet door, too.
And if you'd like, I could take a look
at the washing machine.
No, I couldn't ask you to do that.
It's a disaster down there.
Come on. How bad can it be?
Oh.
Bloody hell.
Everything still quiet in there?
Yes. Thank goodness. Yes.
It would be something though, wouldn't it?
If we were able to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt
that there is a life beyond this?
(SIGHS)
It would be historic.
Is that why you're doing this?
Because you want to be a part
of something historic?
This isn't a laboratory,
this is someone's house.
And I think helping that family
is the only thing that matters.
No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
My daughter died in a car
crash several years ago.
Afterwards, I started
to experience things.
I think she wanted to communicate with me.
And, yes, it would help
if I knew that she was...
I don't know.
Somewhere.
(PIPES CREAKING)
That's not it.
Oh, great.
Think I found it.
(EXHALING)
All right. (SIGHS)
It's right here.

Okay. (GROANS)

There's something behind you.
(SCREAMING)
ED: What is it?
- Oh, Jesus!
- (SCREAMING CONTINUES)
ED: Whoa!
Peggy!
Peggy!
(GASPING) He grabbed me.
It was him. He tried to pull me under.
Oh, my God! Look!
Oh God, you're scratched.
That's not a scratch, that's a bite mark.
He bit me. Just like he did Janet.

(CAROLS PLAYING)
- Aw.

Yeah.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Don't you see it?
See what?
In the kitchen.
Tell me what you see.
JANET: It's playing with the knives,
hiding in the dark.
(WHIMPERING)
Johnny! Johnny, what you doing?
Johnny, no! Johnny, don't go!

We can't let it bully us.
This is our house.

Mum's here, darling.
How did she get in there?
It's all right, darling. What's that?
(DOOR OPENS)
PEGGY: It's fine.
Can I, uh...
What is it?
She's faking it.
What?
I have proof.
(STATIC)
(REWINDING)
So much for your leap of faith.
PEGGY: What?
My girl didn't make this up.
I've seen things.
She was caught red-handed faking an event.
No, it's not possible.
Have you seen it in there?
How could a 12-year-old girl
throw a table across the room?
It's over. Do you understand?
For the sake of your daughter,
don't make this harder than it already is.
(SOBBING)
She couldn't have pulled this off alone.
Oh, how dare you.
What, you think I put her up to this?
What about the police?
Are they in on this, too?
No, it's all right.
What about you two?
You believe us, don't you?
We wanna help.
But the Church will take one look at
that video and that'll be the end of it.
They'll wanna distance themselves from
anything that remotely resembles a hoax.
(SOBBING)
I'd like you to leave, please.
Now, go on, get out.
Get out, the lot of you!
Get out!
Perhaps, you could somehow
reach out to the spirit.
You know, make contact with it yourself.
I can't. Believe me, I've tried.
I'm sorry, I'm just not
sensing anything here.
So, that's it, then?
You hold out a lifeline to them
and then you just throw it away?
We don't like this any more than you do.
We'll tell the Church
about everything we've seen.
But, the only piece
of concrete evidence we've got,
is a video of Janet faking an incident.
Yeah, but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents.
You might want this.
And, just because she faked it this once,
doesn't change the fact that...
No, it changes everything.
We're agents of the Church here.
They'd be calling us home
even if Peggy hadn't asked us to leave.
You've done really
good work here, Maurice.
You were here for them
when no one else was.
Uh, thank you.
But, sometimes you need to
make a leap of faith.
Believe when nobody else will.
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)
This doesn't feel right.
I know.
Have a safe trip.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Did you really do it?
Wreck the kitchen and all that?
BILLY: But, why?
It said it would kill you,
if I didn't make them leave.
LORRAINE: Don't you think
it's a little convenient
that she just happened to fake an incident
in the one room of the house
that had a video camera pointing at it?
Yeah.
(GROANS) No.
Oh, damn it.
(SIGHS)
Lorraine.
Help me set up these tape recorders.
Thread it through
and start it from the top.
All right.
Remember those strange,
garbled messages we got from Janet?
- You know, from Bill?
- Yes.
There were two of them, right?
Here's the first one.
BILL: Help! It...
Let go!
Help! It... Let...
Go!
We thought he was referring
to himself, right?
- Yes.
- Listen to the second one.
BILL: Me... Won't...
Me... Won't...
Me...
(SIGHS)
If I'm right about this...
BILL: Help me! It won't let me go!
Help me! It won't let me go!
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I come here to see my family.
But they're not here now.
I think,
I'd like to go now.
- But I can't.
- Why not?
It wants her. So badly.
It almost has her.
Tell me how to stop it.
I'm given and I'm taken.
I was there at your first breath.
You didn't ask for me.
But I'll follow you till death.
Wait. I don't understand.
Please...
- (SNARLS)

Oh, God!
You're bleeding!
(SOBBING)
What is happening?
The old man's spirit is just a pawn.
He's been enslaved
to where he's to weaken Janet's will.
Enslaved? Enslaved by who?
Something inhuman.
Something that's taken
a blasphemous form to attack my faith.
There is a demonic presence in that house.
You need to get Vic before he leaves.
We need to go back.
Okay.

VIC: Well, I don't understand it.
I mean, first you say it's not real,
now it is.
Her sight was being blocked
by the inhuman spirit.
The old man's spirit couldn't break
through until we left that house.
Everything they've experienced
has been a manifestation of the demonic.
The Old Man, the Crooked Man,
they're just a facade,
trying to keep us from seeing
the real evil in that house.
In my vision, he wanted to help me,
but he was too afraid.
And he kept speaking in a kind of riddle.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(CAR HONKS)
Something like, uh,
"I am given and I am taken.
"I was there at your first breath.
"You didn't ask for me.
"But I will follow you until your death."
Your name. You didn't ask for it.
It was given, when you were born.
That's it! Knowing the demon's name gives us
power over it and we can cast it out.
Yeah, sure, but we don't know its name.
But, maybe we do.
Huh?
Why else would he give us that clue?
He must think that we know it somehow.
So, what do you do now?
An inhuman spirit powerful enough
to cloud Lorraine's sight
is more than a match for me.
We need to get Janet to the Church
before it kills her.
Janet!
What happened?
(PEGGY SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
PEGGY: Janet!
Janet!
Thank God you're here.

Damn it.

I'm gonna go around back!
No! Ed! No!

PEGGY: I'm gonna come with you!

(PANTING)
Ed?
Ed?
(GASPS) Ed?
No! Come on!
(PANTING)
Ed!
It won't open!
Let me try.
(DOORKNOB RATTLES)
- We need to break it down!
- All right.
- Wait here.
- Break it!
Ed, hon, wait right there.
Wait. Vic'll be right back.
I can't wait. I'm going on ahead.
No, Ed, don't! Stop!
You can't fight this alone.
She needs our help!
Ed, please. Please, just wait for me.
Please wait for me.
(SOBS)
I can't lose you. I am so scared.
I know.
Me, too.
But I have to help her.
But, what about my vision?
I know I made a promise to you, hon,
but I have to do this.
I love you, Lorraine.
Ed, no! No!
Stop! Don't!
Ed!
No!
(SOBBING) No. Stop.

What's your name?
What's your...
(SCREAMS) What's your name?
I do know your name.
I asked you.
Tell me who you are!
And you told me.
You told me your name.
And I wrote it down.
I need my Bible!
Why? What's happening?
What...

Janet?
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) There was a crooked man
And he walked a crooked mile
He found a crooked sixpence
upon a crooked stile
He bought a crooked cat
which caught a crooked mouse
And they all lived together in a little...

You are Valak!

The profane, the marquis of snakes!
In the name of the Father

ED: Okay. We're good. Okay.
- Ed, are you okay?

Janet?
Oh, my God! Is she all right?
I'll call an ambulance.
- (GASPING, COUGHING)
- Janet, sit up, darling. Sit up.
Here you go now.
Take a big, deep breath.
Big, deep breath. There you go.
You all right?
(SOBBING)
He'll be fine.
- Does she look all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.
You saved her.
No.
You saved us.
Didn't I tell you it was meant to be?
(CHUCKLES)
But you believed in me.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Thanks for coming back for us.
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Aw.
Here, sit down. Sit down.
(SIGHS) You know...
This has kept me safe (SNIFFS)
since I was a kid.
I want you to have it.
And, when you grow up, you find someone
who needs it, you give it to them.
Deal?
I'm so lucky.
You said one person
could change everything.
But...
I've got two.
Oh. (CLEARS THROAT)
Okay.

ED: Tell me about the beginning,
the first night of your happening.
- What was your brother doing?
- MARGARET: Brothers playing and fooling about.
I wasn't quite sure, no.
- ED: They were scared?
- Yeah, petrified.
ED: Janet? What about Janet?
(CREATURE GROWLS)
When it comes from your area, Janet,
do you feel anything in your throat?
- JANET: No.
- You just don't feel anything?
Now, I'm looking at Janet.
CREATURE: Don't fight in here.
ED: And the voice comes from her, but her
mouth doesn't move and nothing moves.
CREATURE: Turn it off!
I know...
ED: Janet, can you tell when
the voice is gonna come through you?
CREATURE: No. No, I don't ever.
ED: You know who I am?
Do you know what my name is?
CREATURE: Yeah. Ed. Ed!
