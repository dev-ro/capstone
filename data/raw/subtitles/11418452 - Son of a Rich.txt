You have a fancy name, for sure.
What?
- I said: what is your name?
- Anfisa.
Anfisa.
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- So original!
All the people in the club will drink champagne now.
Is not a fact.
Champagne will be just for you and me.
Is it more original?
- Fall down.
- Wow what a cool car!
I've never rode such a car.
Hey, what are you doing?
It won't work like that
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, I will be bored on the road.
Or will you reach out?
Come on, surprise me.
I am not going to...
I'm not that kind of a girl. Fu!
Mmm
Forgive me please.
My mistake.
I was thinking you are that kind.
Oh, sorry.
So, then, bye-bye?
What do you mean "bye-bye"? 
We agreed that you will take me home.
Who are you for me to negotiate with you?
Button, one leg, second, ass.
Ksh-ksh.
Get lost!
Asshole.
Anya, where are you? At home?
I'll come right now.
With whom? With boyfriend?
Make him leave.
And who gave you an iPhone on which I'm calling?
He or me? 
Well, think of something.
Where did you come from?
What do you want, huh?
Stop the car!
- What?
- Stop the car!
Stop immediately.
We will use weapons.
Okay, okay, okay.
- Goodnight. Captain.
- Yes,yes,yes. Take it.
Captain Semyonov.
Show your documents, get out of the car.
We will go to the examination of the sober state now.
Captain? Well, if the captain, then ...
Sorry, cap, I didn't see it.
Do not deny yourself anything.
- Goodbye, captain.
- Hey, where, where? Stop.
- Are you moron, or what?
- Turn off the car, I told you
- I'll crush you, fuck!
- Get out of the car! What are you doing?
- What do you allow yourself?
- Freeze, I'm telling you!
Damn!
Jump off, captain.
The hood will wrinkle - you will pay.
- Hey, I can't see anything.
- Stop!
-What are you doing?
I said stop, you idiot!
I'm going to fall! What are you doing?
- Okay,
let's go to your examination.
- Where are you going, moron? Stop!
- But fast. You do not mind?
-Enough! Do you hear me?
Please, stop!
In winter he was arrested at Arbat street
carrying an unknown organically grown substance
In fact, well-known.
In april he was celebrating his birthday so well,
they smashed up 2 restaurants, sunk the yacht
A month later, this ugly story with beautiful models.
- In fact, not models.
- Don't remind me.
Captain, go out for a smoke.
It's good that nobody got hurt then. 
And now - a concussion, two ribs, a fracture of the pelvic bones.
In other words, he has broken a police officer's ass.
- This is too much, Pash.
- Too much.
Dad, don't believe them.
I was framed.
Ok, good.
Now we'll let him go
we will close the case
you will pay for the treatment.
Compensation, of course,
physical, moral.
What's next?
You already did repairs for us, bought computers,
you changed half of our cars.
Don't know what to ask for?
I'll figure it out.
But I feel sorry for you.
Maybe let him sit here for a year?
We'll find him a good place.
And you will rest, and it is good for him also.
Hey, give me something to drink!
And feed me!
And bring me some chick here.
It's boring!
Come here!
How long will it last, I ask you?
I'm running after you all the time, 
wiping shit after you!
- Even the cops feel sorry for me.
- I feel sorry for you too, dad.
Go somewhere, rest.
Are you laughing?
- You didn't go to rest in Mordovia!
- Well, I didn't go. Why are you bubbling?
- You will go soon! Open up!
- I will not go!
We'll find some poor patient who will sit for me.
Listen, why are you so insolent, huh?
In short, I stop babysitting with you
I'll block all your credit cards!
I'll take your car!
What are you doing?
I express my attitude to your sanctions.
- Stop shaming me
- Watch out.
Hey, dad.
You came, pulled me out - well done.
Now go on wherever you need it all the time.
Run faster.
Otherwise, others will earn all the money without you now.
Fuck you.
- Sasha, focus.
- Nastya.
Pash, why did you come?
I told you I can't.
Nastya, I have stress, I need to relieve it.
Are you out of your mind?
I actually have filming.
Show release in two days.
- Nastya.
- Damn.
Kostya, continue without me.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
- 40
- 20 will be enough.
Pash, why do you have such creepy thoughts?
"My son goes to jail."
You already got him out of it.
But I look to the future. 
And in the future, he chops down woods and drinks very strong tea.
Well, maybe this situation will teach him something, eh.
"Teach". For this you need to have brains.
And Grigory Palych, unfortunately, did not inherit this.
Okay, I'll go.
Anyway, we won't succeed today.
He should have been sent to the army,
to be taught life there.
But I also freed him from the army.
Pash, wait.
Listen, I have an idea.
I know one person.
He is strange.
And his methods are so ... controversial.
I think he can help.
- How do you know him?
- Well, we shot one horror movie together
Well, he was our consultant.
About the maniac.
- About the maniac?
- Yeah.
- It's him?
- Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
Well hello, Lyova.
Oh, Nastya.
Thank God that at least someone came.
I thought I would hang out here until Tuesday 17:00.
I have a scheduled meeting then.
What a bastard you are.
Look how you scared the person.
I apologize.
Won't you be so kind, can you give me a remote control?
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
I was testing, you know, a new system of compulsion to loyalty.
I jumped off the stairs
and forgot the remote control.
Cons of living a single man.
Hanged for 5 hours.
Even took a nap.
Fuh.
What is a system of compulsion to loyalty?
I have one client.
His wife is cheating.
Midas Syndrome.
I came up with an elegant scheme like this:
she returns home and he hanged himself.
Of course, because of jealousy.
She's in shock, rethinking.
Changing her negative model's behavior.
And the wife does not have a heart attack in this scheme?
What heart attack?
She is 45 years old, she sleeps with three more men.
Мм.
She has a big healthy heart!
- Lev
- Pavel
Nice to meet you.
Well, Pasha has problems with his son.
I need to go to the bathroom.
Go on, I'm listening.
Well, the boy is 27 years old.
The boy is completely out of control
Rich kid
With all the consequences
Smoking?
Yes. Also.
We will rid him of his bad habit. 
There are many different effective techniques.
Well, for example
Let's say I am you and you are him
Take cigarettes.
One, two, three
Pasha, my son, if you smoke a cigarette again,
I will do something terrible!
I'll chop off my finger!
- Go on, smoke.
- Ok.
Nastya, we need an ambulance!
- A? A?
- What?
- Look!
- A?
- Look!
- What?
Simple magic trick.
Kindergarten, second group.
A primitive mechanism, but it works great!
This is a real madhouse.
Yes, that's a kindergarten.
He has a more serious problem, by the way.
I understand that.
What stage of despair are you in? The last one?
- Well, yes.
- Aha.
- Have you reached the limit?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Perfect.
It means that you are ready for anything.
Almost.
I am late. I have to go.
Pash
Pasha? Please, wait.
Let's just listen the idea, at least
Hey, it's my car!
Stop!
Stop, goddamn you!
Grish
Grisha, wake up!
Wake up, I said.
Hey, money is in my pocket.
Take it and get out of here, okay?
Aa!
- What's wrong? Where I am?
- Come on, come on wake up
- Why are you hitting me?
- What are you doing?
The lord ordered the horse to be brought, and you are sleeping!
- Are you crazy, or what?
- Get up, I say!
- Leave me alone!
- Get up!
Leave me alone! Get out!
Was he too drunk or what?
I was robbed, or what?
Listen, where is my phone?
Give me your phone.
I need to call.
Avdey Mikhalych is looking for you all over the estate
Get up before he finds you, huh!
Stableman!
It's too late, he found you.
Here he is, lazy.
Loafing.
- How are you with me ... What are you doing?
- Go! ..
Leave me ... Get off me fucking hipster!
What did the lord tell you to do?
What was ordered?
Listen, stop ... stop, man.
Okay, everything can be agreed upon.
You just don't do this anymore, 
so as not to regret later, okay?
Why isn't the horse saddled, you bastard?
Are you confused, or what?
What did I tell you yesterday, you bitch?
What is "yesterday"?
I see you for the first time in my life
Still alive?
I thought you broke him into pieces already, Avdei.
It's easy to do, Alexey Dmitrievich.
Just blink - and I'll quickly tear him to pieces, this bastard.
No-no-no, don't blink, don't blink.
Guys, that's enough, what are you doing?
How did I get here?
Do you have a corporate event?
Why did you dress me up like that?
I'm not from your company at all!
Avdey
Why did you give him a whip, huh?
Beard, you do not come to me.
Bro, calm down this animator of yours.
He's somehow very cheerful.
Well, why are you making noise in the middle of the yard?
Here, dad, I'm teaching a slave.
It is necessary to whip.
I am still alive and I decide who should be whipped.
You have become too arrogant lately, Alexey.
Where is my horse?
- A?
- What's your... ? Grishka?
A!
Wow, you celebrate powerfully!
Who are you? "Sberbank"?
"Gazprom"?
What are we celebrating, father?
So, give him one time.
I'll finish my tea.
And if there is no horse, then whip the bastard.
Help!
Why are you up? Not enough for you?
So, guy, where can I call here?
They will be looking for me.
My father will bring everyone to their knees!
I remember them all.
This is the end of your sect.
You seem to speak Russian, 
but I don't understand a damn thing.
Bring out the horse, ah.
Aha
No, you bring out the horse, you moron.
Man! Man!
- Call the police!
- What?
- Call the police!
- Are you drunk or what?
So where am I?
So, I ... I'm outside the center of Moscow, right?
- Whoa. Stop, animal! Where are you going?
- Are you sick?
- Man, where is the Moscow center?
- What? Which enter?
- Where is the Moscow city, you psycho?
- Are you completely mad?
Kid...
- Grandma, post office ... where is the post office?
- Go to the devil, you madman.
- Listen, call ... I need to call.
- To the church bell, or what?
- Oh bro, listen.
- Grishka, where did you run?
Get away from me!
Stop!
Grisha, are you crazy, or what?
Where are you going?
Just washed!
- I said, do not go here!
- Fuck off, hobo.
Where?
- Are you messing around again?
- Go away, eh!
You need to see the priest, Grishka.
- Guys ...
- Oh, he woke up finally!
Where are you going?
Bear.
Guys, you have a bear there!
Where have you been, slacker?
Grishka!
- Stop! Where are you going?
You can't escape from me!
Well, where were you going?
You hit the fishing nets.
You almost drowned, and also broke the nets.
Now we have to sew up until the day of Ivan Kupala.
And most importantly, why did you suddenly decide to run?
Do you have an extra head?
You are not the Serpent Gorynych!
(* Serpent Gorynych in Russian fairy tales is a three-headed dragon)
Take, put on dry clothes.
- Woman...
- A?
May I have my clothes?
Where are my clothes, huh?
Why are you shoving me some rags?
Where is my jacket?
Jeans? Underpants?
- Lyub...
- A?
See how bad the person feels.
Maybe you can give him a drink to hangover?
Therefore, he does not feel well, 
that there is no need to get drunk to unconsciousness.
I won't  give anything.
Here, let him gnaw the turnip.
He'll feel better.
Mmm, so sweet.
What the hell is a turnip?
Stop pretending!
Who are you, ha?
What are you playing here?
Where are your smartphones?
Why is everything so ... weird?
Where are airplanes, cars, internet?
21st century, Trump!
Russia is governed by ...
Come on, let's say it together. Vladimir ...
Alexander Nikolaich...
Which Alexander Nikolaich?
Grisha, you can make any weird things,
but don't disrespect our tsar-father,
And the century is currently 19.
1860, you know it yourself.
Which 1860?
60th from the birth of Christ.
A.
Grisha, if you don’t want a turnip, take an apple.
Where is my horse?
- We forgot to bring the horse to the lord.
- Grishka got burnt.
There you are, whelp.
Guys, I'm upset too.
Let's breathe out and talk.
What is there?
- What are you doing there?
- So let's go closer and see.
Guys, but for what?
Because I didn't saddle a horse?
I will saddle. Let's rewind everything.
Why are you so sharp, huh?
It's not for a horse.
But for trying to run.
We are very strict with the run away peasants here.
And the court? Why is there no court?
Maybe I just ran for my health.
You have to prove!
Murderers!
I demand a lawyer!
- Quiet, quiet, quiet. Quiet you!
- Beasts!
Grisha, you better wouldn't make Avdey Mikhalych angry.
Do you know what he is?
In a moment he will take your head off,
and that's it, you won't live to see the gallows.
Bro, you're local.
Come on, help, huh. What to do?
What-what...Throw yourself at Avdey Mikhalych's legs.
- Kiss, beg.
- I won't.
God willing, they won't hang you.
Only the hand will be cut off, and that's it.
- Which hand?
- Right or left?
- Right!
Oh, this is probably a dream
It's a nightmare.
I gobbled up something in the club and now I'm hallucinating
I'll open my eyes now and wake up there.
Ok, hand. I agree for a hand.
Left.
Right? Any hand you want.
Both.
Why are you doing this, eh?
Stop immediately!
Avdey Mikhalych,
let him go.
I can't, Aglaya Dmitrievna.
Your father ordered.
I can't disobey.
You can. Why not?
Alyosha, well, at least you tell him.
Okay, sister, I'll tell.
Hang him, Avdeyka, do not hesitate.
Serfs need to be taught.
Otherwise, they will run away.
Alyosha!
Children, why are you making a noise?
Daddy! Daddy, stop killing!
For the sake of my birthday, stop, I pray!
For the sake of your birthday, you say?
Okay, as you wish.
I forgive.
Dad, let's hang the stableman, that's all?
Well, to discourage others.
Mm?
Well, ok.
Hang up the stableman, and let's go have tea.
Daddy! Daddy, wait!
Yes, wait.
Daddy, I beg you, for the sake of my birthday, have pity on the stableman.
He will change.
Yes?
He will change.
Oh, and you have a good heart, Glashenka, eh.
That's what you can't do for the sake of your only daughter, beloved one.
- Thank you, daddy.
Avdey, finish your show here.
That's all.
Oh!
Young lady, our savior!
Our protector!
Thank you!
What are you standing still?
Kiss Aglaya Dmitrievna's feet.
Forgive him.
He froze.
He can't believe in his own happiness.
You gave him a second life.
So live it right, stableman.
Fuh.
It was close.
Oh.
Look, it flies around.
Damn you, bird of death!
You won't eat Grishka's meat today!
Fly away from here!
Go, go!
Oh!
Did you scare?
Grish?
Why are you silent?
Say something.
Do you have dry pants for me?
(song) A dove flew, a dove flew
For fly together with another dove
A dashing fellow was walking
And with a beautiful girl.
This is not a gray dove -
The good fellow is coming.
This is not a gray dove -
The beautiful girl with an open heart is coming.
Actors from the crowd, don't disperse, wait for instructions.
Look, the drone just worked great.
The disguise is great.
To all workshops, when the object is in the stable, 
we disassemble the place of execution.
Nastya, come on, scare these ones.
So, hanged actors, stop moving!
Focus 5 on the stableman.
Artyom, give him a few more minutes, 
and then carefully lead him to the stable.
Accepted.
Sniper, stay in position for now.
If something goes wrong, put Grisha to sleep
without my command.
- Is it clear?
- Yes.
Listen, what are we going to do with the bear, eh?
It's hourly pay, but price is huge.
Let him go.
Letting go of the trainer with the bear.
It would be nice for us to replace the lord's son.
It's kind of wooden.
- How to replace? He had already seen him.
- But he did not remember him.
He remembered everyone.
If he ever finds out that it's all played out,
he will curse us all.
And he will find you and kill you.
We have already discussed this.
We have everything calculated to the smallest detail.
There will be no mistake.
- Lev Arnoldovich?
- Yes?
The gallows control stuck.
Why is he pounding on him?
Let him wait for the technician and replace the remote control.
Jesus,
How did I agree to this?
You must not forget that we are doing a great thing.
We don't simply want your son back.
In fact, we are creating a new person.
And for this he must start everything from absolute zero.
New people, different reality.
Return him to basic settings, take away ...
Well, I heard that already.
- Just...
- What is "just"?
We have built the whole village with these piles of money.
The crowd of actors was rounded up.
Nastya had been pushing video cameras everywhere 
in every corner for a whole month.
And you are just grumpy on the first day of our project?
I'm not grumpy.
Why the hell I'm grumpy?
Yes, you came to get drunk outdoors.
Come on, let's see how your son's patterns break.
So, I'm a stableman.
And I'm in the past.
But I can't be a stableman!
I have a fear of horses even!
And I can't be in a past.
Seems like I'm in the past.
Seems like I'm a stableman.
- What a boring monologue.
- The stableman in the past.
I will be handing out the script to the actors.
I will be handing out the script to the actors.
Why I'm in the past?
Why I'm a stableman?
Listen, I'm afraid of my horse.
She's kind of epileptic.
What if she slams me?
No, she's not an epileptic.
Dont worry she won't slam you.
She will kick you.
- Have you seen execution?
- How did you like me?
- Super.
- Have you seen how I scared this moron?
- Yes, honey, you are the best.
- Listen, I have a pause in the script.
- Mm.
Maybe let's go to the forest?
We can kind of "collect berries".
Lisa, you don't have time now for "kind of collect berries"!
We have a scene with horses now.
- They're eavesdropping on us, right?
PASHA: - Of course, we eavesdrop.
There's a microphone on you
and you are a moron.
So, attention, please, we analyze the script.
We speak strictly by the text.
Minimum improvisation.
Hold it.
I don’t need it. I'm not an actress.
I am responsible for the horses.
So, I remind you the rules.
Girls shouldn't shave their legs.
Men also shouldn't shave.
In general, everyone should not shave.
Bras, panties, rings, earrings - all this is prohibited.
Excuse me, please, I have a question for you as you are an author.
My role is abusive.
Here. Such.
I just wrote a little bit here.
Look please.
Maybe something can be used.
- Right here.
- Wow, it's hard.
I haven't heard that.
Well, in general, all this is ok, yes.
Except the "moronic lizard".
And what is here?
Walrus mouth!
Let's delete this.
So the last thing I remember is ... I left the club.
The tow truck took the car, I ran after it.
Car lights ... that's it.
I am dead!
I'm in hell?
But it's so weird hell.
Why the hell is in the past?
And why I'm a stableman?
As I see, I did not miss anything?
Artyom, try to push our philosopher
to his direct duties.
How long will this last, eh?
Yes, you are a stableman. 
So maybe you will work in a stable at last?
Exactly!
What if the car that hit me
its a time machine?
And from this hit I somehow transported into the past.
- Like ... like in this movie.
- In which movie?
In which movie?
What did he say? "In which movie"?
Have he seen a lot of movies in 19th century?
Artyom, don't panic. 
We will solve it.
Why do you ask "in which movie"?
This is a color movie.
You cannot know it.
Anyway you have here only black and white cinema.
Well, thanks God.
- He is dumb.
- You are dumb.
The person is under stress.
He travelled into the past.
So, it means that from the blow I was transported here, to the past.
To return,
I need to hit me again.
Exactly.
Hey guy, do you have a car here?
Ancient one.
«Zhiguli»? «Chaika»?
A big stress.
They almost hanged him.
I see.
Yes, I seem to be stuck here for a long time.
Grisha, wake up!
What do you mean "wake up"?
I didn't sleep a minute!
How can you sleep on the ground?
- Come on. Come on.
- I won't go! I won't go! I don’t want to!
- They stink! Stink!
- Come here.
I won't go!
Ok, ok, ok
I should call you Avdey Mikhalych.
That's better.
And only Lyoshka can call you Avdeyka.
Ay!
Alexey Dmitrich!
Good boy.
- Eat.
- What is it?
And where is the meat?
Here's the meat for you
Right there?
And where else?
Just pick a burdock here.
Everything is already cut off there.
Come on! Why did you stop, damn it?
You are not a horse, you are a sheep!
Go home!
Listen, I have an idea.
Let's kill Avdeyka.
I 'll take his boots and you - jacket.
Mm?
Occupied!
What is occupied?
All the forest is occupied?
In general, here I can get used to everything.
To the food, to these burdocks.
Even walk without panties.
There is only one thing I really miss.
So horribly.
I am just suffering, imagine it, see it in my dreams.
A. Woman?
Internet.
Have you read my ad?
Hello.
No, not sold yet.
Yes, 2007
Not broken.
Color - silver metallic.
- Sister.
- Mm?
Do you think sex for money is prostitution, or not always?
- What are you talking about, brother?
- Oh, come on.
Do you think I don't know about your contract?
That you have to make "hanky-panky" with our rich boy.
For your information, it's not a "hanky-panky",
but a serious love line.
Mm.
The key point of the project, I would say.
Hm.
There are winter tires, studded.
Almost new.
No, you don't have to pay anything.
It's like a bonus.
So will you come by yourself there, right?
And the bed scene in it is very responsible.
I even worry about it.
I would like to rehearse.
It's a pity there isn't anyone.
I can't, I'm serious.
I have a wife at work.
I get it. Goodbye.
Doesn't anyone need a car?
And when will we have some progress?
Changes, fixes.
Where is the progress?
It will be right now.
Polina, start.
Bring the 7th camera to the big screen.
Something happened?
Yes.
Well, don't cry, ha?
Let's talk.
What happened?
Here is your progress.
He connects to other people's problems.
Empathy is an important emotion for us.
Papa wants me to marry with an old landowner, but I don't like him.
And papa doesn't even want to listen me!
There's nothing to cry about.
Is he rich?
Yes.
Perfect. All of you are dreaming about rich husband.
But he is old one!
That's even better - he will die soon.
And you will get everything.
You should be happy.
Do you want some berries?
Take it, take it.
They are so sour.
Yes, it didn't work out with sympathy.
But he has cynicism.
We have a huge scope of work.
Prokhor.
Walk calmly, don't turn around.
Can you find a saucepan or something to cook the soup in?
- For what?
- Look!
This chicken belongs to the lord.
Let her go quickly.
I won't!
I need a meat. 
I won't survive if I only eat mosquitoes.
And I'll make myself a pillow from feathers
Well, where is your soup?
Finished.
I couldn't wait more for you.
I actually did all the work for you.
And I ate all the soup for you.
1:1.
Who stole the chicken of the lord
Let him come out and confess.
You will have only 10 strikes by whip if you ll be honest.
If the thief doesn't confess - I'll punish the random slave.
You for example!
- Me?
- You!
- Me? For what?
- You!
- Avdey Mihalych!
- Go!
- Don't do it! It's not me!
- Then who?
- It's not me!
- Then who?
Well, if it won't work - it won't work.
Anyway I won't be able to come.
- What's the difference? I have some things to do.
- Listen, take him to the hospital.
The ambulance is waiting there.
Lyov, don't you think it's time to act somehow more decisively, eh?
- I think so.
- It is necessary that someone died because of your son.
- What do you mean "died"?
Work injury while mowing.
Mowing knife, belly - zhah!
This is a serious experience.
Tell me, why do you have everything connected with death, with violence?
or a violent death?
Why not?
When you fry eggs, you break the eggs.
Don't tell me about your eggs!
And what if he starts to stutter from fear?
- Me?
- Wait.
And if he won't sleep for two weeks?
Who? Me?
You bastard, selfish.
What's wrong with her?
Nevermind ..
She doesn't love me very much.
- Fucked up on that horror movie?
- Which horror movie?
Well, on that movie where you consulted her.
Have you forgotten or what?
Hm.
Is that what she told you?
Well, it's not easy to forget.
This horror movie, Pasha, was called "legal marriage."
And it lasted 3 years 5 months 9 days.
Damn.
10.
Ah, where he is.
Standing here, resting.
This is your fault.
The whole back is striped.
Bro, what have I got to do with it?
Avdeyka chose you by himself.
Why didn't you confess?
Listen, I get it.
It's like a prison here.
You should not confess.
Everyone relaxed like at a resort.
Here our carpenter went to cut firewood.
Hm.
And didn't take off his watch.
Why didn't you take off your watch, donkey?
And that's what the dogs dug up.
Here.
Chocolate wrapper.
Great.
And we have fantastic eggs from our chickens.
- Well, good eggs.
- Good eggs.
- Natural.
- Natural.
And what is this?
So you're fired exactly from this date.
All the rest get back to work.
Another error - I will penalize and fire you.
- Ex-husband, then, yes?
- So what?
What-what-what. 
Don't you think that you have to warn me in advance
about such things?
I dont think so.
You and I just relieve stress.
Why we have to share unnecessary information?
You know, this information is not unnecessary at all.
Where... I didn't finish.
I thought 10 strokes by whip were just a play for I confess
and after that I would be hanged.
So,man, I really glad to see you alive.
Ay!
Cool panties!
What?
- Where did you find this underwear?
- What?
This is a modern underwear.
This is panties from the future!
- Don't touch me! Leave me alone!
- Show me your panties!
- Aa! Help!
- Show me!
Guys, we have an emergency.
- Show me, I said!
- Help!
Get him away from Lisa immediately!
Don't touch me!
Get off!
Grisha, are you crazy?
This is glitching.
Comrades.
I was thinking all the night
and I made a calm and balanced decision.
I close this poorhouse to the hell!
Right now! Immediately!
- Pasha.
- What?
The panties situation won't happen again.
We doubled the control, and Anastasia personally has checked everything.
Yes, I have checked everything.
I've seen enough of this.
It's not about the panties, Lyova!
It's all about this!
Do you understand that nothing is happening?
He doesn't change!
The same rubbish, only in a different century!
Have I arranged a resort for him here, eh?
For he can enjoy the fresh air?
Do you know how much money I lose every day?
Do you know how much?
And it's even not about the money!
If there was a result!
But there is no result!
Pash, let's leave these unnecessary emotions, ok?
Nastya, you have everything unnecessary - emotions, information.
- Don't you believe in your son?
- Of course I don’t.
And I don't believe in you, Lyovochka.
In your original methods.
They don't work.
This is all nonsense!
Can I interrupt you?
We've got something going on here.
What is going on?
Is he hitting the child now?
He is looking for Lisa.
Lisa? Which Lisa?
The one without panties.
Blonde. Well, I mean, with blond hair.
All the time with horses
What is her name?
- How can I find her? Where she lives?
- I don’t know what to tell you.
Why are you all like zombies today?
Nobody knows what to say to me.
Ask why he needs her.
Why do you need her?
I want to apologize.
- He wants to apologize.
- Apologize?
Yes. Well, are we going to close our poorhouse?
Were you looking for me?
Yes. I...
I want to warn you, I have a stick with a nail.
Ok, I see.
I wanted to apologize ...
What is your name?
Lisa.
Forgive me.
I behaved like an animal.
Don't insult animals.
Ok. Like a mushroom? 
Can I insult mushrooms?
No, really, I'm ashamed.
I didn’t sleep all night, I was worried.
I do not know your traditions here.
Maybe suddenly I disgraced you right now,
and now dad will whip you, and no one will marry you.
Well, why no one?
According to our tradition, you will marry me now.
Lisonka is a fire.
Mmm?
Aha...
Just kidding. I don't need you.
Okay, I’m not angry.
But I don't take the stick far.
Why do I have to yell first and then everyone starts working, huh?
You told me right away then that he would apologize.
How could you know?
I didn't know.
I believed
Sometimes you just need to believe in a person.
Ivan Kupala is the most magical night of the year.
Boys and girls are looking for their halves.
Yeah, whoever you spend this night with - you will spend your whole life with him.
Yeah.
No offense, dude, but the last thing I want to do is spend it with you.
Or with you.
Look what a beauty.
Bonfires.
What is this, the whole party?
Yes, boring one.
Well done, you got it.
Wait for the signal.
People! People!
Listen to me!
Let's make some noise!
Repeat after me!
Ok?
So, let's start with the simplest.
Just... just a classic.
Come on.
Don't be shy. And...
Yes-yes! Come on!
Round dance!
Go ahead!
Twirl your asses, don't be shy!
- What is this, lambada?
- Yeah.
Right now, we really got into the past.
Aglaya Dmitrievna?
Grisha, let's dance!
Let's drink! Let's have fun all the night!
- Why are you so ...
- I want to forget everything in my last days.
- Are you leaving, or what?
- I'll drown myself today, Grisha.
I will not marry without love.
I'll drown myself, and that's it.
We carefully distract Grisha, and unnoticeably take Aglaya off the field.
Is this a romantic setting?
Light like in a morgue.
I cannot influence the moon.
Shines as best it can.
Turn on crickets and light on torches.
Ok.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What's up?
Why don't you hang out with your fellow countrymen?
I don't want.
After all, you are all strange here.
Too complicated.
But in the 21st century, everyone is mostly relaxed.
I'm happy to hear that.
And still everyone is looking at me like “you’re crazy”, “you have demons”.
I have even no one to talk to, except Proshka.
Nobody believes me.
Well, ok.
Let's say I believe you.
Artyom, why are you jumping there?
Aglaya is ready.
Send Grisha to the lakeside.
And let the son of the lord also be removed, 
otherwise he already orders Leps.
(*Leps is a modern singer)
Come on, don't you know "A glass of vodka"?
Come on little by little, come on.
Come on.
You have a box and I have a box.
You say "hello" to your box and I say "hello" to my box.
And we hear each other even we are far away from each other 
in a different villages.
How is it?
Well... Well... because...
How?
Miracle.
Grisha, have you seen Aglaya Dmitrievna here by chance?
No, no, I have not.
And the most interesting
You have all your life in this box - 
Photos, and...
Where is he? It's so cold.
Can you give me at least a mosquito spray?
Be patient, he's coming.
- Is he coming?
- No.
A huge iron bird.
And there are three hundred chairs.
And you sit on them and fly across the sky.
- Right across the sky?
- And what, everyone is allowed into sky?
- No, no, no, not everyone.
Depends on your condition.
They didn't let me in a couple of times.
Oo..
I can't find Aglaya Dmitrievna.
Hope nothing happened.
Get away!
We are not only flying on the sky there.
We also go underground there.
- Right under the ground?
- Yes,yes.
We call it subway. 
There are such huge iron worms
they drag crowds of people from home to work,
from work to home.
Scary, I guess?
Yes, yes.
That's why I do not go down there.
Proshka, what about Aglaya Dmitrievna?
I say, I can't find her anywhere.
She's lost. I hope nothing bad happens
Because she went to the lakeside.
- Lakeside?
- Aha.
Why didn't you tell me from beginning?
Moron!
So now I'm a moron.
He is running! Pretend you're drowning!
Aglaya Dmitrievna!
No!
Aglaya Dmitrievna!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Aglaya Dmitrievna!
Why did you save me, Grisha?
Why do I need this life without love?
Aglaya Dmitrievna, let me take you home.
Why home? I don't want them to see us.
Right here, Grishenka.
Into the carriage.
Yes, come here, Grishenka.
There is no one here.
Come to me, my savior.
Warm me.
Five seconds.
Where did he go?
A?
Come to me, warm me.
I’m frozen.
Are you sure?
- Where is the rich boy?
- Ran away.
Here, he sent me.
Take coffee. I added cognac there.
Come on, drink it.
You will warm up.
So.
My son just gave up on the woman and sat down with the man.
Consider, shrink,
if you also changed his orientation, then I ...
Listen, I can't find Lisa.
Have you seen her?
And Aglaya Dmitrievna?
Are you already done, or what?
Yes. Why should I stay with her for a long time?
Let her lay down and return to her consciousness.
Can you tell me, where Lisa lives?
What, the appetite is awake?
Okay, I'll find her by myself.
Don't you know?
- Lisa?Lisa?
- Yes?
Attention, everybody, freeze!
Silence in the acting room!
Everybody, hide!
He is coming to you.
Lie quietly.
Hey, where did you run away?
Let's go for a walk?
I'll tell you some more about the future.
I can not. Father won't let me to go out.
He feels really bad.
They say who you will spend this night with
you will spend your whole life with him.
Are you sure you want to spend it with him?
Lisa, give me a bucket.
- Sorry I cant.
- Faster!
From that night, Grisha and Aglaya were to begin a stormy romance.
Then she had to tell him that she is pregnant.
Grisha had to confront her oppressive father
and on pain of death run away with her.
In other words, to take responsibility
for his beloved woman.
- Beautiful.
- Very beautiful.
But yesterday, unexpectedly, 
Grisha chose another beloved woman for himself.
I have nothing to do with it.
I did not do anything.
Do you think you didn't do anything?
You said you believe him.
Now you are the most important person in the world for him.
And we can't go on without you
You can forget about Aglaya.
Sorry, but I won't sleep with him.
And I'm not asking you to sleep with him.
And I will not kiss.
I don't like him at all.
I don't like him either.
But now he's just an ugly duckling.
And we have a chance 
 to create a beautiful swan  from him
What duckling?
What swan?
This old bastard is fucking crazy?
He probably thinks, if you are a veterinarian, 
he can tell you any nonsense about animals, you will believe.
Well, I don't know.
And I like his idea.
I can really help make a good person out of him.
We are all here for this.
Stop, stop!
Ok, ok, come on, come on.
Lord, we have trouble!
Whoa. That's it.
Lord Dmitry Alekseich.
Dmitry Alekseich, we have trouble!
What's wrong, Avdeyka?
Something with Lyosha?
With him, your lordship.
Oh, holy heavens, what a woe!
Didn't notice!
We were in the city with him on business.
He persuaded me to go to the tavern with him.
What tavern?
Well, I strictly forbade it.
What tavern?
I'm sorry, I disobeyed.
I couldn't argue.
He hit me in the face.
So.
And where is Alexey?
Daddy ...
And after the tavern, Alexey Dmitrich sat on a horse
and the constable was trampled.
How was trampled?
To death?
God had mercy.
Only broke.
Oh God!
And who is constable?
Well, this is the one who keeps order.
Aa, cop.
What are you doing, Alexey?
Why did you hit the constable, eh?
Couldn't you choose someone from ordinary people?
Goddamn him, dad.
Let him know to whom he is whistling, the bucket mustache.
I'm a fucking nobleman!
Kind of.
Saddle the horse.
I'm going to the city.
Yeah. Well, Alexey Dmitrich created problems.
Even I am ashamed of him.
And I'm jealous.
Dude had a cool night.
I'm coming.
Listen, in general, I just want to say.
If you and Nastya start a relationship
let me know, okay?
So, of course, I don't care.
But ... I don't want to go around like a fool.
But you go around like a fool.
What do you mean? Have you already?
Ah, I knew it!
- Well, thanks for saying.
- I haven't finished yet.
What are the details?
Ha. Come on, burn it.
Where, when?
Pasha, she loves you.
Well, no.
What are you talking about? No.
We just have sex.
No commitment.
Just for health.
- 10 years?
- Well...
9.
Well, you want to say that she came to ask for help from her ex-husband, 
whom she hates, quit her favorite job, 
struggles every day among mosquitoes, sleeps for 4 hours,
for a man with whom she's just having sex for health?
What, are you really that good?
Oh, what a fool.
Why are you looking at me like an owl from a hollow tree?
Things are bad, Alexey.
They will come from the city tomorrow.
To whip...
Whom? Me?
Yes, it would be nice, of course, if it was you.
But we will replace you with Grishka.
Mm
What?
The constable whom Lyosha hit is still in the hospital.
He is being treated.
Others will come from the city to punish.
And they don't know Lyosha by sight.
And if we wash and dress you up
you will look like the son of the lord.
Its only 20 whip strokes.
Or maybe you could talk to Proshka?
He is an experienced person.
They remember him in the city.
He was at the fair.
Only you can.
Dad, why are you begging him?
This is like animal, you can just demand.
Wait, Alexey!
If you agree, I will sign the documents for your freedom.
You will become free person, you can build a house, get married.
And if you not agree - you will get 40 whip strokes!
So count, if you can, slave mug!
Lyosha, go out!
Eat, Grigory.
Eat and think.
If you agree
I'll give you a watermelon.
You bastard.
Again you ate everything alone.
Wow
Thank you, bro.
By mutual voluntary agreement of the parties,
in order to avoid further claims,
Alexey Timofeev, guilty of intentionally hitting a constable
Uryashev Mikhail Semyonovich,
sentenced to two dozen whip strokes.
Fuck!
- Pasha.
- Mm?
How are you? What happened?
Well, I can't calmly look at all this. 
This is my son after all.
Yes, I understand.
I've always wanted to whip him by myself.
But not in that way ...
Listen, well, this is Lyova.
- His methods.
- Yeah.
He loves grand spectacles.
You have some kind of nostalgia in your voice.
Well, no.
Did you miss these grand spectacles?
Listen, when I lived with him,
he tested all these ingenious ideas on me.
- Do you remember how he chopped off his finger?
- Of course.
I quit smoking like that.
- Really?
Wow!
Knock knock.
Your father told me to come up to get the documents, here ...
and so on...
Father went to visit the Dubrovsky family.
He'll be back tomorrow.
It's strange.
Can you give it?
Well, you are a lord too.
Of course I can.
Have a seat.
What are you, ferret, are you going to sit down with me at the same table?
What, bastard, have you completely lost your fear?
You could say from beginning, that you have non-visiting hours!
I can come later for documents.
What documents, you idiot?
You will be my slave to the rest of your life!
- Got it?
- We kind of agreed.
Who are you to negotiate with you?
I am a nobleman!
And you are cow shit!
He wanted to be free.
Here is your freedom!
Come on, Grisha, rise up, rebel!
Hit him! Smash!
Get out of here, walrus muzzle!
Coward.
Most importantly, do not be afraid.
Give it like that.
Think about something good.
They feel everything.
So nothing complicated.
Well, in general, I get it.
- Feet - gas, hands - brake.
- Something like that.
Lisa
Here, this is for you.
- Did you bake it yourself?
- Not. But I stole it by myself.
 - You don’t know how.
- I can. Give it to me.
- That's all.
- What «all»?
Hey, hey, stop!
The brake does not work!
Sorry, I stole the cheesecake.
Here I return it.
Actually, I missed two.
And the second cannot be returned.
Let me help you.
- Let's go back.
- Come on.
- What were you thinking about?
- Nothing.
I don't know.
About you.
Life is strange.
I used to think that this whole time travel story
only exists in movies.
And now?
Well, I'm here.
It's a pity, of course, that you can't choose a specific time,
to which you can be transfered.
What time would you like to travel to?
Well, I would like to travel back in time ...
I don't know...
Probably, I would like to return to the time when my mother was still alive.
I was very small.
I don't remember her at all.
What kind of bird is this?
I see it all the time.
Look, how strange it flies.
Drunk bird.
Watch how it spins around.
We have a problem with a drone.
I'm out of control.
Get him out of there.
Can it fall down right on their heads?
Oh, it will fall down right now.
- Oh oh oh...
- Why are you worried?
Lisa, get him out of there immediately.
But it's not just a bird.
There is no transmitter on her.
She doesn't hear anything.
Then call the sniper.
You know? 
I see this bird since childhood.
Sniper, listen.
This is my guardian angel.
- Put Grisha to sleep urgently.
- Received.
I really would not want him to fall now.
- Ok, ok, I hold it.
- End of alarm.
Oh it's gone.
And Proshka said that it was a bird of death.
Well, Proshka is not the smartest person at all.
You and him are somewhat similar, by the way
The third day is the same thing.
Drink tea, walk, play solitaire.
No action.
Even the microphones were removed.
Why are you unhappy?
The money keeps coming.
Seriously?  And what about the fact 
that I went here for the main role, 
How this sheep could steal it for itself, I cannot understand.
Hey, that's enough. She didn't steal anything.
The rich boy had a crush on her by himself.
And by chance.
- By chance?
- Yes.
You're so naive, I just can't believe it.
She seduced him on purpose.
And she will leave you soon, you'll see.
You are so angry because you haven't had sex for a long time. 
Right?
Oh, don't pretend you had.
I had not too.
It turns out that I was even lucky 
that I was transported to the 19th century.
Mowed the grass, chopped wood,
cleaned up the horses, and that's it, I'm free.
And if, for example, I was thrown to the dinosaurs?
They would eat me on the first day, and that would be my time travel.
What is this?
- Aglaya Dmitrievna?
- Alexey Dmitritch?
This is not what it seems.
Incest! Perfect!
We're talking about love, about family values,
and we see brother and sister who have sex in the carriage
and we see brother and sister who have sex in the carriage
Lannisters, damn it.
- We didn't think she ...
- They did not think!
Do you have any idea how you let us down?
- Why did you sleep with your sister?
- Well, she's not my sister!
Listen, but what's wrong?
Well, another century, different customs.
Maybe we use it in the script somehow?
Well, like an educational moment.
I even know which moment.
Fired! Both!
I told you.
Come on.
Carefully.
Voila!
Put your hands down.
Welcome to the world's first barn restaurant "Grigory Palace"
- What did you make here?
- You will see now.
Please.
So, what will you order for an aperitif?
- What?
- Say "cocktail".
Co... cocktail
Co... cocktail
- Cocktail.
- An excellent choice, madam.
One second.
And today we have moonshine from potato peelings.
Cranberry skins, honey, spring water.
It is called "Drink to the bottom - you won't wake up alone."
So, an appetizer.
Carrot tartare on burdock.
Radish carpaccio with cucumber.
And that is not all.
The main dish.
From the chef.
Crucian carp, roasted on the fire.
With a tomato.
Raise your hands, please.
Bon appetite!
Why did you suddenly do all this?
Well, I wanted to please you.
I see that you are kind of ... sad for the second day already.
It's probably because of these perverts in the carriage.
Yes, it was terrible.
Hey, don't...
Don't think about that.
Money spoils people.
I know it myself.
Sorry, we only have one fork.
Let's take turns eating.
- Now is your turn.
- Thank you.
The safest is to start with this, I agree.
Thanks for the evening, Grisha.
I never have been in ....
How did you say? In a restaurant?
And in the future, we would go to karaoke after the restaurant.
Where?
Well this is a place with a lot of people
and everyone is singing.
- As in the church?
- No, on the contrary.
If I were set free
I would marry you.
Look how fast you are.
Maybe I wouldn't marry you.
Well, that's the second question.
And they didn't give me freedom.
They cheated me.
Yes, it was unfair.
And maybe it’s fair.
I wanted so badly to hit the lord's son in the face.
And then I looked at him ...
and I realized: it's me.
I was the same brute.
What's this?
Did he realize it all, did he?
Maybe it was all conceived so 
that I was transported here
 and saw everything from the other side.
What?
Nastya, do we have champagne?
Yes, yes, on this project they torture a person.
He thinks he is in the past, but in fact he is being bullied
in the most inhuman way.
What role did you have on the project?
I was forced to have sex with him.
I refused, of course.
I refused.
But as you understand, there was another, less principled.
In other words, you want to say that sex is provided 
for Grigoryi on the project?
Well, that doesn't sound so inhuman.
They whip him and feed him with the pigs.
Does that sound not so inhuman to you, either?
It sounds awful.
Somewhere in the village, they deliberately drive a young man crazy.
What are these creepy experiments?
And how can we save Grigory?
All information on your social network - by hashtag #Grishaholdon.
Grisha, hold on.
Information on forcibly holding a person
is currently being checked.
An area has already been established in which, presumably,
there is a so-called project.
An operational group was created, which included the best specialists.
Okay, it's time to finish.
Let's do it right now.
- It's early.
- What's early? What's early?
Guests can arrive in the coming days.
- Tomorrow the helicopter will fly over us.
- Don't panic, we'll make it in time.
In time?
What we will make in time?
He realized everything!
But he didn't do anything!
Knowing without action means nothing!
Well here's a simple example.
- Have you realized that Nastya loves you?
- And?
And what did you do?
Guys, I can't come up with an idea when I don't understand what we need.
Our old plan is canceled because we do not have time to implement it.
And the new one, when will we have time?
But we got together now to come up with a new plan 
and have time to implement it.
I want Grisha to do a heroic deed.
So, heroic deed. Which heroic deeds we know?
We all think, we all think without exception.
Why is the author of the project silent?
Why are you silent?
If we consider this as a computer game,
we are now at the end of the level.
So you need a battle with the boss.
- It could be, for example ...
- The Dragon.
So, we all think, except you.
You go get some air.
Come on, come on, dragon.
No, he's right, we need some kind of dragon.
Ah, he's right, isn't he? Good.
Nast, call to Moscow, we will order the dragon.
And what, I like it.
Well done, exactly.
A dragon arrives, demands the most beautiful girl in the village.
And Grisha saves her!
Wait.
Can I ask what kind of dragon is needed -
red, green, blue, icy?
And you write it down. 
We need to call later to Moscow.
Stop it. You understand that the dragon is metaphorical.
This is some kind of powerful opposing force.
- Enemies-invaders.
- The Golden Horde!
Yes! Tatar-Mongols!
What are the Tatar-Mongols?
We have the 19th century here.
- Oh yes.
- But he is a dumb!
- What?
Oh sorry. Well, that's just an advantage right now. 
What if it works out?
And if not - well, let's say it's a joke, the fair has arrived.
Are you serious or what?
Guys, he's stupid, but not this much!
Let's think some more.
A?
I will miss you very much.
What?
Well, if we suddenly part for some reason,
I will miss you so much.
Why can we part?
Well, I do not know. You never know.
Anything can happen.
It's just that no matter what happens, 
I want you to know that it was all for real.
Run!
There's a meeting in the square!
Tatar-Mongols have arrived!
Wait, wait.
What Tatar-Mongols?
Tatar-Mongols , those who are...Tatar-Mongol yoke?
Well done, my son.
Aha.
Why are we running to them?
We must run away from them.
It is logical.
So, Artyom, tell him that if you don't come back,
then the Tatar-Mongols will burn the village.
If we don't come back
they will burn the whole village.
They count everyone by their heads.
People will be burned.
Here we got on a bus with windows sealed with foil.
We didn't know where we were going.
But we did not go long, about 30 minutes.
Where exactly?
There.
There, then?
Let's go.
Collect five chickens from each yard,
a bucket of eggs, a bag of millet
and three rubles in silver.
We don't have that much.
- What is it?
- The Tatars are pressing.
Collect and collect.
You should be happy, Russians!
Great honor has come out to you.
Khan decided to marry.
The most beautiful girl will go to the Golden Horde.
Look what you have in mind, devil cross-eyed, eh!
Take our things, don't touch the women!
A horse is your wife, a piece of pecheneg!
I won't give you my woman!
Yours, apparently, are ugly!
I do not want! No!
No!
No, don’t! I do not want!
Please!
Let me go!
This is my daughter!
Get your hands off her, you brute!
Khan respects you, brave man.
You can take your daughter back.
But first -  fight with Ulukbei.
Won't you fight?
I will!
Vanya, give me an ax.
Father! Father, don't ruin yourself!
Who is this dude? I have not seen him in the village before.
Nice fight.
Of course. These are the most expensive stuntmen.
Holy-holy-holy...
And the head is not similar.
Listen, are you not ashamed?
The make-up artist only had 3 hours.
The father paid in blood for her.
- Dad! Dad!
- Khan lets you go, girl.
Since the khan wanted to marry even more,
a new bride is needed.
Mm.
No!
Does this beauty have a protector?
Who wants to fight for her?
Grisha?
Won't you protect her?
Let Lisa scream, call him.
Yes, accepted.
Nice girl.
Ha-ha.
Why are you silent? Do you like it?
Call him.
Grisha!
Grisha, help me!
Grisha!
A good wife will be!
Haha. Good bride!
Grisha, help me!
Girl, what a good girl.
Grisha!
- He just left?
- He was offended.
Well, what's next now?
What is there, what to do?
Lyova, you see, this is the end.
Well, that's all.
Come on, it didn't work out with a heroic act.
It's time to quit it, come on.
- We wait.
- Well, what are we waiting for? Until the cops find us?
Let's put him to sleep, come on.
Hello. What are we doing?
Sniper, don't move.
We wait.
What's wrong? I say it won't work with a heroic deed, come on
The man was frightened!
Anyone in his place would be scared
Guys, the police will be here in exactly 3 minutes!
So, sniper, let's work!
Received.
Canceled. I believe in him.
And you believe.
Well, angel, ..
will you help?
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
Get away from her!
Go away!
I'll kill you brutes!
Yes!
Hero!
Amazing!
Get down on the ground!
Down!
Down, I said!
Hello, fellow sectarians.
Murderers, torturers.
So what, who's in charge here?
Is that you?
So, I didn't understand, why do we have strangers on the set?
Where is this radio presenter sitting?
I'll show you everything now.
Everybody stay where you are!
Hello citizens.
Hello.
And try to explain what is happening here.
- We are shooting a movie.
- Wedding movie.
What?
Corporate movie specially for the wedding.
- Yeah.
- Yes, I'm the groom.
This is my fiancee.
- We have a wedding soon.
- Yes. I am a bride.
Would you like a glass of champagne?
Thank you. I don't drink at work.
What are you laughing at, Mikhailyuk?
- Let's go from here.
- We're leaving.
Mm.
By the way, where are they going?
And really, where?
To a bright future.
Would you like a 95 or are you on the gas?
Man, where are we?
Grisha, I'll explain everything now.
Dad, where am I?
You're in the hospital, son.
Everything will be fine.
- What ... what happened?
- You were in a coma.
- Don't you remember anything?
- In coma?
You left the club, ran after the tow truck
and you were hit by a car.
We have been fighting for your life for 3 months.
But what about the village?
Where is Lisa?
What village, son?
Which Lisa?
(song) Let's play hide and seek,
I won't look for you.
I'll find the one much better
I will find a completely different one for me.
Let's play hide and seek,
I won't look for you.
I'll find the one much better
I will find a completely different one for me.
Let's play happiness with you
I won't play with you.
After all, you shouted into the phone:
"Go fall in love with another."
Well, how can I fall in love if she is not you?
After all, they are not you.
This whole world is not you.
This whole world is not you.
What chicks? Only frosts.
What roses? Thorns and splinters.
Do you hear, mug!
What have you poured for me?
Drink it yourself!
I told you clearly: Hennessy XO!
Aglaya?
Aglaya?
Aglaya Dmitrievna!
Bro, take your hands off
Alexey Dmitrich!
How did you get here?
Lisa ... Is she with you?
Where is Lisa?
Dude, are you drunk, or what?
Antokh, who is this anyway?
I don’t know, Polin.
I see him for the first time.
Sorry guys, I ...
I have problems with my head.
Due to injury.
Everything is ok.
I confused you with someone, sorry.
- She must be somewhere there.
- Thank.
So...
...everything was real?
I missed you.
So good.
Look at me.
- Look.
- Smile.
Now spin around.
Perfect.
- Let's change location.
- Let's go there, my love.
Let's go.
- It's good here.
- This way? - Yes.
Now get closer to each other.
Nice. Look at me.
Good.
- Dad.
- A?
Congratulations.
And thank you.
For what?
For everything.
- Hello
- Hello
- Anastasia.
- Grisha.
- Congratulations.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's for you.
- Oh, thanks a lot!
Let's all take a photo together?
- Ok.
- Nice idea.
Get closer to each other.
Say "cheese".
Can they have some champagne?
Hooray!
Leave me alone! Who are you?
No!
Bastards!
Where's my phone?
I'll call my mom now!
She's a prosecutor!
She will put you all to your knees!
Choose, slave, which hand we will cut -
left or right?
Do not dare!
Avdeyka, shut up this little pig.
Mama!
Grisha, Artyom, go to the control room.
- What a flimsy son of a rich.
- Yeah. We will change him quickly.
