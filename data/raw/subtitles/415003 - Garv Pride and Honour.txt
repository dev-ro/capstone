This is ACP Arjun Ranawat.
He barged into the prime
 minister's farm house...
...on the night of 1st November and...
...brutally killed the
 deputy prime minister...
...Badrinath Trivedi, his
 son, Munna Trivedi...
...the police commissioner
 Yeshwant's son, Chandrakant...
...Desphande, police inspector
 Avasthi, advocate Kulkarni...
...the six MLAs of the reigning
 political party...
...and counting some government
 and police...
...officers, all in all,
 eighteen people.
He isn't the guardian of law,
 but the abuser of law.
With this cold blooded massacre,
 not only...
...has he put a blot on the face of...
...the government and police,
 but even humanity.
These are some of the photographs...
...taken from the scene
 of crime, your honor.
The police requests the accused...
...to be kept in remand
 to investigate...
...this brutal massacre and the
 reason behind for fifteen days.
Do you want to say anything
 about these accusations?
No.
Do you have any lawyer?
 - No.
Would you wish the court to
 appoint a lawyer for you?
No.
The government has accused you...
...of killing eighteen
 innocent civilians.
It has asked a remand of fifteen
 days for investigation.
Do you want anything
 during this time?
Do you have the need of anything?
Yes, I do.
 - What is it? - Death.
The accused is put into
 police custody...
...for the period of fifteen
 days in remand.
Saying that he was perfectly sane...
...Ranawat says that
 he has committed...
...this massacre in his total sanity.
When the judge asked him whether
 he needed anything.
He answered what he
 had before, death.
Is this the charge sheet
 that you've prepared?
Is this it? Just a murderer?
 He isn't a murderer!
He is a demon!
Look at this! Look at this!
He snatched my brother, my son...
...and son-in-law from me! He wiped...
...the vermilion from the foreheads...
...of my daughter-in-law
 and my daughter.
He even ate up your son, isn't it?
Are you not sorrowful about that?
He didn't leave anyone to set
 fire to our funeral pyre.
He vanquished our line!
 Our lifeline!
Listen to me, lawyer.
Bad character.
Corruption.
Bad thoughts.
Betrayal of the country.
 Even till that extent!
Accuse him of every crime
 written in your law book.
Put all the sections
 of your law on him!
Open him up.
Sign these documents.
You have killed my only son.
Till the time the court
 doesn't punish you...
...I will give you a new death
 every day in this prison.
He hasn't signed on these documents.
He has given his life in death's
 hands. Please come.
Son.
Why did you put your weapons
 down in the court today?
Why don't you tell the world
 why you massacred them?
Why are you asking death
 for yourself, son?
Why are you doing it?
Because I performed my last rites.
I wish freedom from my
 body and this birth.
Mother.
From today. You and Rakhi, both.
Please don't come to meet me here.
Because in the Hindu religion,
 mothers and sisters...
...don't visit the funerals
 and cemeteries.
I'll leave now, mother.
This was our companionship
 in this birth.
I will be back. Tell your
 God to borne me...
...from your womb the next time too.
Respected Mr. Samar Singh.
My final greetings to you
 and your principles.
I have walked away from
 your principles...
...this uniform and
 this police force.
I have a final request of you, sir.
Please don't say that 'Truth
 Prevails.' ever again.
Because the truth is that
 in this eunuch society...
...lies...
...Unlawfulness...
...and injustice is
 victorious always.
I want to tell you, sir.
We soldiers are not just
 government machinery.
Outside the police station,
 even we have a life.
We don't know where we lost it
 walking on your given path.
So you are here still. You
 haven't gone to the temple.
Didn't I tell you, son?
 - Mother.
What will I do going to the temple?
You have looked after your
 body for too long now.
Come and look at God now too, son.
You want me to go to the
 temple and pray to God?
Yes. I'll be very grateful to you.
Where are you taking me?
 - Come here. Sit down.
'Hail the Goddess Jadgamde,
 Hail Goddess Durga.'
'Hail Goddess Kali, Hail
 Goddess Saraswati.'
You crazy boy, what are you doing?
Don't you see, mother?
 I am praying to my God.
Someone has said the truth.
Because God can't be everywhere
 at one time...
...therefore, he created the mother.
Mother, you are my temple
 and everyone.
Are you crazy?
A mortal man is not
 compared to God, son.
Is it so?
Do you remember the
 '84 riots, mother?
When a child was crying
 over his dead parents?
God hadn't come at that time,
 you had, mother.
My real mother had just borne me.
You have given me life though.
 My being is because of you.
Only due to you, mother.
I gave birth to Rakhi. But you
 are the piece of my heart.
I didn't ask anything
 after getting you.
Why are you lying, mother?
You pray for brother's well being...
...from morning to evening,
 and yet you say that...
...you don't ask anything from God?
Rakhi, keep quiet. You are jealous.
Because mother loves me more.
What? I am jealous of you?
Oh God!
She has come in the
 mood for fighting.
I haven't come to fight.
 I have come to tell you...
...that I am going to college
 and I have taken...
...one thousand rupees
 from your wallet.
Did you see that, mother? Loot
 in a policeman's house.
I didn't loot anyone. I have
 taken what is my right.
I have laid out your breakfast.
When you mother and son will...
...complete your tearful reunion...
...please eat it, I will be very
 grateful. I will leave now.
Did you see that, mother?
 Rakhi has grown up.
Yes, son. When the
 daughter grows up...
...a mother has got more
 responsibilities on her breast.
What are you talking about, mother?
Does a cow ever feel that
 her horns are heavy?
You worry about Rakhi's
 marriage, isn't it?
Yes.
 - Don't worry.
Your son will marry his
 sister with such pomp...
...and splendor, the whole
 world will be stunned.
Greetings, brother!
A hero won't be so famous
 as Hakim Lukkha is! - C'mon!
What is the hurry, sir?
 I am human too.
Why are you dragging
 me like a beast?
Sir, will I get a fag?
Shut up and walk, you wretch.
Let the judge give you in
 police custody once...
...I will give you nice cigarettes
 in the lock up after that.
That will be decided with
 the judge's decision.
When these police
 men were accusing...
...Hakim Lukkha of cutting off the...
...prostitute's nose
 and ears, he wasn't...
...in Mumbai city forget
 about Grant Road.
He had gone to Lucknow.
For the party's work.
This is the proof of the
 police's wretchedness.
This is the air ticket to Lucknow.
This is the register of
 the Lucknow Guest house...
And your honor, this
 is the manager...
...of that Lucknow Guest house.
This lawyer is lying!
 Hakim Lukkha is a pimp.
He whores innocent girls.
Did you hear that? Did
 you hear that, mi lord?
This is the respected police
 of our Mumbai city.
It is abusing people standing
 in the court.
If you use any abusive and vulgar
 language in this court...
...the next time, you
 will be suspended.
This time, I warn you and leave.
Please don't waste
 the court's time...
...by bringing such matters in court.
The accused is released honorably.
I've told you a thousand times.
Be respectful in the court.
They are ripping our shirts apart.
And you say that we
 should respect them?
Didn't you lose your pants
 in the court, Mr. Arjun?
I had said it. I had announced it.
That this time too Hakim
 Lukkha will be released.
What did you do?
Actually, sir.
An enmity with me is
 dangerous for you.
And dangerous for your sister too.
I have heard that your sister
 is very beautiful, sir.
No, Arjun!
Wait, Arjun!
I tell you, leave him!
Come to your senses! Are you mad?
Hey, Kulkarni, take this pimp away!
Hey, explain it to your hero!
These wrestling antics of his
 will be very expensive for him!
I will have his uniform snatched!
You will have my uniform
 snatched? Come on.
Hey, take him away.
 - I am going.
But explain to this hero.
The lawyer says that
 the enmity will prove very costly.
Enough, Arjun. It is enough.
What is enough? You always stop me.
That bastard son of
 a bitch Hakim Lukkha...
...spat on our face and we
 couldn't do anything.
And you tell me to stop it?
See this, do you see this?
The government has dangled
 a gun on our waist.
But we can't use it.
And those rascals shoot in
 the middle of the road.
And what do we do? What do we do?
We just take those pimps in
 the magistrate's presence.
That Kulkarni comes
 and releases them.
And what do we do? We hold this
 in our hands and stand.
Get up.
That pimp is not worth
 irritating your brains.
You go, I will come.
 - Yes, why will you come?
It is time for your heaven to come.
You have started it all over again?
 - You rascal.
Why are you shy of bringing
 to your lips...
...what exists in your heart already?
She has expressed her
 love a lakh of times.
And you...
Please go.
I'll go.
It is bad to suggest anyone
 anything nowadays.
And listen, don't drink a lot.
 You will be driving.
'Beloved, my beloved.'
'I am cream and cheese,
 I have come from Delhi.'
'I have brought some dessert
 too, please taste it.'
'I am Champa, I am Chameli,
 and I am alone.'
'I have brought mischief too,
 please taste it,'
'My fiery body, my fair
 body, my body burns.'
'It is my youth, this
 world is crazy.'
'You be crazy too! Be crazy too! '
'I have come on the
 command of my heart.'
'I have come on demand.'
'Please come, please come,
 loot my beauty and youth.'
'This is my miracle!
 This is my miracle! '
'My goods are for free!
 Take some symbols! '
'The dress irritates me, it
 tortures me, what do I do? '
'Take me in your arms! Take
 me in your arms tightly! '
'Taste it a bit.'
'Take a bit of my youth too! '
'Beloved, I fall at your feet! '
Jannat, did your lover give you
 a flying kiss today too?
Thank you for your sympathy.
Jannat, all rich people
 are at your feet.
And you are dying for a policeman?
What does he have?
You won't understand, my dear.
Rich and generous people
 are found in this bar.
But I can see only lust and hunger...
...in the eyes of every man here.
But Arjun.
I see respect and conscience
 in Arjun's eyes.
You crazy girl, till when will
 you wait for him like this?
For my whole life.
And if that is less, I will
 give my next life to him too.
This ring that I wear in my neck.
Only Arjun will make me wear this.
She won't understand.
Did you recognize me?
What are you staring at me?
She is so good!
She is a virgin! A virgin.
I have so many good
 girls like these.
If you ask me, I will give
 you a new one every day.
You will just have to speak
 to me with respect, okay.
Respectable people are
 spoken to with respect.
Not with pimps.
Who do you call a pimp?
See this street.
It is all alone.
Neither a man nor mankind.
Look here too. Look.
You can't see anyone till afar.
If I kill you here
 right now, nobody...
...will get any proof or any witness.
That who killed the
 ACP Arjun Ranawat.
There will only be your photo
 in the newspaper tomorrow.
And your sister will be
 in my jeep from tomorrow.
I will leave now.
Think about what I told you.
Work for me. Or else,
 an unknown death.
He is correct. A Lonely street,
 unknown death.
What if I kill him here?
Yes, tell me. What do
 you want to tell me?
Thanks for the suggestion.
Suggestion?
Look at this, a Lonely street.
Look at this. Neither
 man, nor mankind.
And tomorrow in the newspapers...
...it won't be my news but yours.
An unknown death.
No!
No!
The Mumbai city and the government...
...has been shaken by your
 misdoings yesterday night.
Your murdering spree has
 blotted the police force.
Look at this. Look at
 this and look at this.
Someone is calling us
 a uniformed hooligan.
Someone is calling us
 a uniformed devil.
You will have to reap
 it's punishment.
Write on that paper.
You lost your sanity in
 anger and murdered them.
I didn't do this massacre
 in anger or insanity.
I did this in self-defense.
A man doesn't break a person's...
...seventeen bones in an
 act of self defense.
He doesn't make him
 lay on his back...
...and empties the whole
 magazine of his gun.
This is...
This is the autopsy report.
Have you not read
 the procedure code?
You should warn a criminal first.
Then in the air and later on
 the legs, bullets are shot.
And then, you could inform
 the control room too.
I committed a huge mistake.
When his revolver was below my ear...
...and he was about to
 press the trigger...
...I should have called
 up the control room.
Then I should have fired
 in the air once.
After that, I should have
 fired at his legs.
I committed such a huge mistake.
That wretch was talking about...
...killing me and making my sister...
...sit in an courtesan hall.
 At that time...
...I should have told him,
 'Brother, please wait.'
It is a crime to kill
 a police officer...
...and make his sister sit
 in an courtesan hall.
I am sorry sir.
But if I had walked on your path...
...my name wouldn't be written here...
...but outside in the
 police station...
...in the list of people
 dead on duty.
And you wouldn't be shouting here.
You would be shedding tears
 on my bullet-ridden body.
Wrapping it in an Indian tricolor...
...flag and playing the bugle.
There is a limit to insolence
 and shamelessness.
I say, we should declare him
 a killer and set an example.
If you want to clean the good for...
...nothing and useless image
 of the police force with...
...the blood of an upright police
 officer, you are welcome.
Nobody has any proof that
 I did these killings.
Neither you, you or you were
 present at the incident site.
You can only declare me
 a killer, not prove me.
And I won't say this, my lawyer
 in court will say this.
And nobody will have
 any answer to this.
This Hakim Lukkha had
 28 cases against him.
He had started thinking
 the police station...
...to be his house, his house
 to be his whore house...
...and a police officer
 like me to be his pimp.
What had he done to him?
In twelve years of this
 police service...
...I have died at their
 hands a thousand times.
I had just two ways out.
Either I would live on Lukkha's
 throw outs and sell law.
Or else, I'd put down this uniform...
...and tolerate everything
 like an eunuch.
I refused to be a pimp or a eunuch.
Sir, if these criminals
 can be released...
...by the courts and move around
 like innocent civilians...
Then why can't I kill
 them and move...
...like a innocent civilian?
 Why? Why?
Do you want to say anything else?
He is saying the truth, sir.
But sadly, what can be done?
That's what we will have
 to think, Jadhav.
What we have to do in
 such a situation.
No, sir. Punishing Arjun is not
 an answer to this problem.
What is the answer to this problem?
We won't catch them in an clash.
We will kill them, we
 will encounter them.
When the criminals will see
 us terror on their heads...
...they will see only two
 ways for themselves.
Give up or death.
And only then will the dream of
 a crime free country be true.
Are you ready for this?
You start the Crime Control Squad.
Our government is with you.
The police! Run!
 - Shaheen! Take the weapons out!
It is too much now.
The Mumbai police which would
 piss just hearing your name...
...that same police has
 killed twenty seven...
...of our boys within thirteen days.
Yes, brother.
This Mumbai Police has
 shaken up this...
...same Mumbai city which we ruled...
...sitting here for
 twenty five years.
The police has become
 death in today's date.
It doesn't arrest or
 ask to surrender.
That commissioner tells
 to kill directly.
That CM has their
 hand on the police.
Therefore the lowliest
 of the officer...
...laughs in the face
 of Zafar Supari.
I'll tell you brother.
 Just say the word.
I will go and blast that
 commissioner's head right away.
I will show the Mumbai police
 not to touch a live snake.
Call that opposition
 leader Kashi Trivedi.
Tell him to create a hullabaloo by...
...branding the police
 the murderers...
...of Dalits, minorities and
 innocents in the Upper house.
Through the accusations
 of fake encounters...
...in the press, make life difficult
 for the policemen.
Shake the chair of that CM.
I will show this CM
 and commissioner.
The government on which
 they jump so high...
...is worked by this Zafar Supari
 sitting in an foreign country.
Down with the heartless government.
 Down with the uniformed hooligans!
If you want to create
 a hullabaloo here too...
...just like the upper house, what is
 the meaning of this meeting?
What is your problem after all?
I don't have a problem,
 I have a question.
Till when will this
 police of yours...
...play a blood bath on the
 streets of the city?
Till the time that the last of this
 city's gangster isn't dead.
Till the time we don't achieve
 the objective of a crime free...
...state, till that time,
 - Oh, Mr. Chief minister...
...please explain it to your
 crazy commissioner.
To stop shedding the blood
 of Dalits and minorities.
Politicians like you shed blood.
Not the police.
Who created fights in the
 country in the name of...
...temples and mosques? You did it.
The Brahmins against
 Yadavs in Bihar.
The Thakurs against Dalits in UP.
And the Muslims against
 Hindus in Gujarat.
Who did all this? You did it.
It is leaders like you
 who make a brother...
...kill his brother and
 then warm the bread...
...of rule over their funeral pyres.
Human right's violator!
You are accusing me? Me!
I will topple Satyanarayan's
 government in a snap.
I will topple your chair,
 understood?
I will make you a constable
 from a commissioner.
Whose human rights are
 you speaking about?
Those hooligans, who don't
 humans to be humans?
Those who shoot at innocent people?
Who make their wives widows
 and children orphans?
Are you praying for
 their human rights?
They aren't humans.
How can we have human
 consideration for them?
They just understand
 one tongue. This one.
Shut up!
You are jumping on their
 strength, isn't it?
This chief minister's
 days are in air now.
I will transfer this commissioner
 as soon...
...as I become the chief minister.
And about you.
If I don't make you
 salute me everyday...
...my name won't be Kashi Trivedi!
Then listen to what I
 say too, Kashi Trivedi.
The day that I get some
 proof about you.
You won't be sitting on
 the chief minister's...
...chair but on your funeral pyre.
And I promise you.
You won't even get one man
 to shoulder your funeral.
You have made this city a Gestapo.
You have colored the streets
 of this city with blood.
What do you have to say about this?
 - Is this not the death of democracy?
How long will you kill in
 the name of humanity?
What is the difference between
 police and hooligans?
Is this encounter your
 helplessness of greed?
What is the need of murdering
 in the name of encounters?
It is necessary. There
 is a necessary.
What do you think?
When we go to arrest them, do the...
...criminals wait with
 garlands for us?
No!
They welcome us with a spray of
 bullets and dangerous weapons.
It is our moral right to shoot
 in self-defense at that time.
It is our democratic right.
Do only criminals and terrorists
 have human rights?
Does a soldier not have
 any human rights?
Are we soldiers not human?
Zafar Supari has threatened
 to kill...
...every person in the
 encounter squad.
He has made a hit list of
 the entire encounter squad.
What will that pimp make a hit list?
We have made an hit list.
Look at this.
Do you look at this red marks?
These are with God today.
The rest, will be soon.
Take this hit list. Print it
 in your newspaper tomorrow.
The next time Zafar
 Supari gives you...
...and interview tell him that we...
...have started cutting his
 name from the ration cards.
I have come to drop you till home.
Won't you call me in? I mean,
 tea or something?
Yes, I am your lover, I love you.
I have that much right at least.
Okay. So come in, Mr. Vivek
 Acharya. Please come in.
You will be made to drink
 tea and with that...
...you will be introduced
 to my brother too.
Brother is at home...
 I mean, is he home?
He is a policeman.
 When he's at home...
...when he is in the station,
 when he...
...goes to do someone's encounter...
...even the almighty
 doesn't know that.
Okay, Miss Rekha, I mean,
 Miss Rakhi, I will leave.
Why? Don't you want
 any tea or something?
Tea?
I won't even be able
 to drink water now.
Why? Aren't you scared of brother?
Scared? The whole city is
 afraid of your brother.
He speaks less with his mouth
 and more with his gun.
You fool!
If you don't meet brother, how
 will you ask me for your hand?
That is your responsibility.
I will talk to my brother.
But when will you talk to your dad?
Leave him to me. Once that
 our marriage case...
...reaches in his court, his
 decision will be in our side.
Brother...
There is a boy.
He studies in your college.
The son of Justice Acharya.
The two of you love each other.
How do you know that, brother?
I am a policeman, not a milkman.
I keep an eye on the whole city.
Won't I know whom my sister
 meets where and when?
Do you take me for a fool?
Do you love him?
 - No.
Yes.
Look at me.
Really, brother?
I will talk to his father.
It is a matter of pride
 to make your sister...
...a daughter-in-law of my house.
But...
Remember that we are
 from the boy's side.
We have some conditions.
This engagement will
 take place tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
But we need some time
 for arrangements.
The engagement should
 take place tomorrow.
But sir...
You are not in a hurry,
 I am in an hurry though.
If your sister changes
 her mind tomorrow...
...my son won't get such
 a good wife and I won't...
...get such a good daughter-in-law
 anywhere else.
Therefore, the engagement
 will be done here tomorrow.
'She is so beautiful, she
 seems to be my heart.'
'Lf she just opens her eyes
 the heart sputters.'
'The lips say that she
 seems to be my life! '
'The eyes.'
'Your eyes.'
'Your bindiya... '
'Bangles.' 'Your bangles! '
'It decorates so well! ' 'Earrings! '
'Your earrings! '
'Even the moon will shy away
 looking at your face.'
'The star's hearts will break.'
'Dreams! '
'Your dreams.'
'Keep it.'
'Keep it well.'
'O dear! '
'Your beloved looks so cute! '
'You got the procession, I
 will go in the procession.'
'I will go from the house
 but not from the heart.'
Sir, your informer no.
 555 wants to meet you.
Send him in.
 - Right sir.
Salutations sir.
Come in.
Yes, tell me. What news
 have you brought?
Sir, I have definite news.
That Zafar Supari... he
 has given a contract...
...to kill the commissioner.
And Zafar Supari's main hit-man...
...is that Pappu Kalia.
He has a master plan, sir.
And to succeed in his contract,
 he's going to meet...
...4 to 5 shooters at the 'Can
 Can' nightclub, tonight.
Okay, you can go.
Goodbye sir.
'Oh darling! '
'The beauty is wearing
 a blouse of flames.'
'And yet love has not aroused yet.'
'You have robbed me, my beloved.'
'I've drowned in the sea of love.'
'I won't regret even if I die.'
'I'll be reborn just for you.'
'My heart is restless, it
 only wishes for you.'
'I don't know what may happen.'
'Oh darling! '
'My heart burns and
 its smoke rises.'
'When will you know that, my love? '
'Lf the pain rises or
 I loose my sense.'
'Even then I gave my
 heart only to you.'
'I consumed the poison, I
 swallowed the pain.'
'Even then I didn't take your name.'
'I have decided that I'll do
 what I have never done yet.'
'I consumed the poison, I
 swallowed the pain.'
'Even then I didn't take your name.'
'I have decided that I'll do
 what I have never done yet.'
'My life belongs to my love, but
 my love is not aware of it.'
'I don't know what may happen.'
'I have no other wish in
 my heart except you.'
'Your lover is yearning while
 you have fun and frolic.'
'You are the God of my love and
 I'm thirsty for your love.'
'I see the divine in your eyes.'
'You are the God of my love and
 I'm thirsty for your love.'
'I see the divine in your eyes.'
'You are my pride, you
 are my dignity.'
'I don't know what may happen.'
'Oh darling! '
Arjun, drop your weapon!
Or else I'll kill this girl.
I'm telling you to drop your weapon.
Or else this girl
 will lose her life.
I'm telling you for the last time,
 Arjun. Drop your weapon!
I'm telling you to drop your weapon.
Drop it!
Kashi Trivedi! I made you
 a minister from a milkman.
I made you an M.L.A. And a
 leader of the opposition.
For what? For this day!
So you can give milk sitting
 in the parliament.
Hey Kashi! Pappu Kalia is dead.
One by one all my lead
 men are killed...
...by that police commissioner
 of yours.
My 25 years of rule over
 the Mumbai city...
...was all destroyed by
 your Mumbai police.
And over there you have
 ruined my name...
...in front of the I.S.I.
Do something, minister.
 Think of something.
Think of a solution to this.
 Relieve us from this problem.
I have a solution for this,
 brother Zafar.
But it will cost you a hefty price.
I was just thinking, when will
 you bark for more money.
Okay then, tell me how much.
Then listen to me carefully, Supari.
The government of chief minister
 Satyanarayan Joshi...
...is only supported by
 eleven independent MLA's.
And from those eleven, nine
 are ready to be bribed.
The cost is 60 crores.
That means with 60 crores you
 can become the chief minister.
Okay Kashi, over rule
 the government.
You'll get the 60
 crores by tomorrow.
Then just think as you
 have become the...
...prime minister of Mumbai,
 brother Zafar.
Everyone in the government
 will consist of our people.
Government will be ours
 and the rule will be yours.
Hey Munna! Hey Badri!
Didn't I tell you?
We'll fix, we'll break.
We'll fight and make
 others fight too.
I'll make the parties
 and break them too.
But one day I'll definitely
 sit on this chair.
That day has arrived, Munna.
Now I'm the king of this state.
And the rest all are subjects.
Listen brothers, all you
 ministers', MLAs'...
...and officers' honesty,
 that is ho... nes... ty...
...is a thing of the past with your
 past chief minister. Understood?
Now whatever I'll say will
 be considered as orders.
Whatever we'll decide
 will be the law.
Tell me Bhonsle, have you brought
 my transfer orders...
...from the chief minister's office.
How did you know, sir?
I knew, as soon as the new
 government is in rule...
...the ministers have an old habit
 of transferring officers.
Bhonsle, explain to these ministers.
Only area can be changed
 by transfers...
...not determination.
Tanaji, you take care of yourself...
...and keep writing letters to me.
So you have also received
 the news of my transfer.
So what's there to worry about it?
This sort of things, do happen.
But sir, the people who
 changed government...
...in 13 hours and transferred
 you in 3 hours...
...how can soldiers like
 us who are only paid...
...10 to 12 thousand rupees
 fight against them.
Avasthi, by putting a price
 tag on this uniform...
...don't insult all our
 country's honest officers.
Terrorist fight for money.
Soldiers only fight
 for the dignity...
...and safety of their country.
Son, they can put
 someone else in my place.
But they cannot change our
 thoughts and our rights.
Sir, from now onwards your
 rights will be our duty.
The fire of your heart is now
 burning within our hearts.
Sir, the dream you had
 of a crime free state...
...now we'll fulfill that dream.
This will be our gift to our master.
I have spent 60 crores to break
 and make the government.
And for that, not only
 60, not only 600...
...but I'll torture 36 thousand
 crores citizens of Mumbai...
...to repay all that amount.
From builders to actors...
...and from doctors to producers...
...don't spare anyone.
Tell them, if they want to live then
 need to pay the protection money.
If they want their
 families to be safe...
...then they should
 send money to Zafar.
If anyone wants to do
 business in Mumbai...
...or even if someone wants to
 breathe freely in Mumbai...
...then send brother Zafar
 his salutation money.
Yeda!
These police people
 thrashed my men...
...in their own homes.
Then threaten their homes too.
Their mothers, sisters,
 wife and kids.
If someone disagrees
 then chop them up.
Tell the police force, to be
 afraid of this father of theirs.
From this Zafar Supari.
Mom! Where are you?
Brother!
Leave me!
Don't be afraid!
I'm not here to kill you but
 to make you understand.
You know Zafar Supari.
He lives in a foreign country...
...but rules over the
 whole Mumbai city.
Officers like your brother
 serve Zafar Supari.
Explain it to your brother.
That consider Zafar as father
 and Yeda as elder brother.
Always salute him. Be afraid
 of brother Zafar.
Next time I won't come here
 to explain anything.
I'll chop your mother to pieces
 and kidnap you too.
And an ways a hot girl
 does not belong here...
...but in the arms of brother
 Zafar. But after me.
Who was here?
Rakhi!
Who was here, Rakhi? Tell me.
Yes, tell me.
 - Yeda!
One of Zafar Supari's men.
So tell me Chopra, how would
 you like to have a bullet?
With whisky? With soda?
With water?
No brother!
 - Or else... direct!
No Yeda Bhai, forgive me.
Forgive you? You use
 to fly very high...
...when the commissioner was there.
No Yeda Bhai. That... I...
C'mon. Bring three crores cash,
 the overseas rights...
...for your new film,
 and the contract...
...for its home video and music.
C'mon go.
I'll bring it. I'll just
 bring it, Bhai
What did you say? You'll chop
 our mothers in pieces?
Kidnap our sisters?
No, Haider Bhai.
So, pimp of Zafar Supari...
...c'mon spread your chaos
 in the Mumbai city.
Now threaten the police force.
No.
So Yeda, now you tell me...
...how would you like
 to have a bullet.
With water?
With soda?
With whisky? Tell me.
Or else...
No! - Direct!
No!
Chote, its Yeda calling.
Yes Yeda, tell me.
Brother, these people,
 they have killed Yeda.
What?
What are you blabbering?
I'm not blabbering. But telling
 the truth, Zafar Supari.
Who are you?
Ma... Po... Se...
Ma... Po... Se...?
Yes, Maharashtra Police Service.
Zafar Supari, here's an advice.
Don't send a group of eunuchs
 to take on real men again.
Remember this, Zafar,
 for thugs like you...
...there is no other thug greater
 then the police in the world.
Zafar Supari, this is
 your final warning.
For you there will be
 no charge sheet...
...only D-final, which
 mean only death final.
Jai Hind!
Brother!
 - Hey Rakhi!
You two at the police
 station together.
Tell me who is here to
 complain about whom?
First of all you write
 down my complaint sir.
This sister of yours keeps
 threatening me all the time.
If you don't do this then
 I'll get you arrested.
If you don't do that then
 I'll get you handcuffed.
She is doing nothing wrong.
Look brother, the government
 is giving him...
...a scholarship for higher studies.
And this sir denies on leaving.
Brother, not even three weeks have
 passed for our engagement...
...and she wants me to go away
 to Canada for three years.
No, brother. I won't go.
If I would have been in your place
 then I would have left...
...the next day after engagement.
 - Brother!
Don't miss it.
You have already got her
 now, don't leave that.
And as far as your fiancée
 is concerned...
...then my name is Arjun Ranawat.
You betrayer! In your rule that
 inspector Arjun Ranawat...
...tortured Yeda and my
 men to death like dogs.
And you are just laying eggs sitting
 on the chair of the C.M.
Warming the seat, is that all?
No brother, the matter is...
 - Don't interrupt me.
If you don't take care of
 those policemen soon...
...then I'll take care
 of your whole family.
But brother I was...
 - Son of a pig!
If I can make a government
 with 60 crores...
...then I'll just blow your head
 with a bullet worth Rs. 60.
And wipe out you and
 your entire family.
What happened, Mr. Kashi?
 Who was it?
It was my father. My mother's
 lover. Zafar Supari.
You idiot Yashwant Deshpande...
...I brought you all
 the way from Pune...
...and made you the police
 commissioner here.
For what? To dance in your
 father's procession?
It is not in charity
 but by paying a whole...
...2.5 crores, I have become the
 police commissioner of Mumbai.
Look at this. Did you
 hear that Kulkarni?
He's crying for his 2.5 crores.
Explain your father, those
 encounter specialist...
...killed Zafar's men. Were
 you cooking that time?
Now go and dismiss this
 encounter team.
I don't want to see this
 encounter team again.
Understood or not?
I just can't do anything
 like this, Mr. Kashi.
Then what can you do?
 Just ring bells.
Am I the home minister
 of this country?
I told you that I just
 can't do anything.
Even the D.G. And the central
 government are involved in this.
This anger will give us nothing.
Whatever we'll have to do, we
 have to think carefully and do.
Mr. Kashi, first think
 of Arjun Ranawat...
...and before that think
 of Haider Ali.
Haider is the eyes
 and ears of Arjun.
He handles all his networking.
If you eliminate Haider
 then think that...
...you have broken
 the spine of Arjun.
Mr. Kashi, I'll take care of Haider.
I'll make an issue of his religion...
...and try for his transfer.
I don't want mere trying.
 Transfer him.
And that too very soon.
Mr. Arjun!
Just wait!
 - Yes!
I know that you are the strong
 and the silent types...
...who don't say their hearts out.
But what will you do with your eyes?
What are you saying?
I wanted to say that I
 can clearly make out...
...from your eyes that
 you love me very much.
Anything else?
Okay then tell me, should
 the ring be worn...
...in the finger or around the neck?
In the nose.
 - Stop joking.
Please tell me.
 - In the finger.
Then hold my hand and put
 this ring in my finger.
And make me your companion.
Companion?
 - Yes!
First don't let me suffer so much.
 - What?
I'll make you wear the ring
 later but first wear this.
Jannat, beauty is adored
 when it's covered.
'The heart which falls in love.'
'That heart becomes a non believer.'
'Then may God be angry with
 you or the world leaves you.'
'Or even if the life deserts you.'
'When the magic of love takes over.'
'Then everything seems
 to be unfamiliar.'
'Lovers are already crazy, but
 even the world seems crazy.'
'The intoxication takes
 over your eyes.'
'The fun of life begins.'
'My heart just feels
 to be restless.'
'There's a sea of love in my heart.'
'You come and sail on it.'
'My heart seems to be drowning.'
'You come and save it.'
'My heart is going out of control.'
'My heart just won't
 slow down thumping.'
'My heart just feels
 to be restless.'
'Love is such a thing.'
'It's dearer than life.'
'It would trade your life.'
'It is such a nuisance.'
Haider Ali, here is
 your transfer order.
You are being transferred from
 the job because of your caste.
You hand over charge to
 ACP Arjun Ranawat.
But why sir? - The special
 investigation team will be on...
...an operation to investigate
 the Mumbai underworld's...
...link with the ISI and exposing
 some of the ISI agents here.
It is their opinion that in this
 operation some of our officers...
...may be soft on the
 alleged ISI agents.
Why don't you say it clearly sir?
That I'm being transferred
 because I'm a Muslim...
...and hence would be helping
 the Muslim criminals.
Look at this.
 Can you see these bullet marks?
These are marks from bullets
 fired by Muslim terrorists.
The bullets coming
 out of my gun doesn't...
...ask a criminal his
 caste or religion.
Whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim.
Through this report
 you want to convey...
...that my caste, my religion is a
 proof of me being a traitor. - Haider.
No Arjun.
Even if I cut of my head and give it
 to them, even then this department...
...would not believe that Haider is a
 honest and patriotic police officer.
Haider don't do it. Ali don't do it.
I don't want to do this job, Arjun.
Commissioner, Haider Ali
 is such a Muslim...
...who can sacrifice his
 life for his country...
...his land, even
 without this uniform.
This is a mistake on your part sir.
They are neither Hindu nor Muslim.
 The traitors have no Caste or religion.
The mere fact that I'm a Rajput
 or that you are a Brahmin...
...is not proof of us being patriots.
Such a cheap criminal thought
 takes youths like Haider Ali...
...to wrong directions,
 distancing them from our country.
Why don't you understand?
 These decisions are not taken here.
They are taken in the offices of
 the Home ministry and DGP.
If you have the guts, go there and
 tell them what you just now told me.
Shut up. You mean that he,
 who took his belt of and...
...walked out abusing the police
 department in front of a Commissioner...
...that ill mannered junior
 of yours is correct?
That we are all communal...
...is that what you want to say?
If your seniors call you and
 tell you that you are a Sikh and...
...that you would be aiding the
 Khalistani terrorists and hence you...
...are being transferred from Punjab
 then you'd also have not liked it.
Sir, if you were not stopped from
 fighting Sikh terrorists...
...then why is Haider Ali Khan
 being stopped from fighting...
...Muslim terrorists and ISI agents?
Without any proof or witness...
...just on the grounds
 of the religion...
...to suspect somebody
 is unconstitutional.
Our constitution gives prominence
 to duty. Best man for the job.
It does not give
 prominence to religion.
Haider Ali Khan is such a
 soldier who would like his uniform...
...to be adorned a million times, but
 would never let it be tarnished once.
The dudes have proved
 be to be a traitor...
...now they will knock me of
 in an encounter any day.
What is this? My arrest warrant?
Or is it a search warrant
 against a traitor?
No. These are orders
 to have to more pegs.
But have it joy. - What do you mean?
Read it and you'll know.
Your transfer order
 has been cancelled.
You did this for me?
 - No, for myself.
Because, the police department
 needs officers like you...
...and I need a friend
 like you. - Is that so?
The you must also
 do something for me.
You ask for it. - The listen.
An angel like
 daughter in law for the mother.
An angel like
 sister in law for me and Rakhi.
An angel like wife for you.
'I'll hide you in
 my eyes in such a way'
'How ever you try to escape,
 I'll steal you away'
'In your love my dear'
'In your love my dear,
 I'll forget the world '
'How ever you try to escape,
 I'll steal you away'
'The vermillion on my forehead tells
 it The bangles on my hands tell it.'
'The anklets on my feet tell it.
 Listen to it my dearest.'
'I'll adorn you forehead with stars
 I'll fill your heart with happiness'
'I'll make you my bride.
 Listen to it my dearest.'
'I've found out my life.'
'I've found my happiness.'
'I've found my love.'
'I'll make love'
'The mirror of love.'
'How ever you try to escape,
 'I'll steal you away.'
You have entered this house on the
 day of celebrations to our goddess.
My fortunes have opened up.
 May you live long.
Dear, this is a special gift.
Rakhi had it made so
 as to give it to her...
...sister in law when she
 comes to this house first.
Hold this dear.
May you live long dear.
May your hands always
 raise to bless me mama.
Hold this mama. Let me show
 you the house Sister in law.
Go along dear.
She is good. You sit down,
 I'll arrange for some food.
Hey Deshpande.
You are scared like a
 sixteen year old teenager in bed.
Listen, I'm deputy Chief Minister...
...and when the elder
 brother is the CM...
...what damage can the report...
...being prepared by that
 ACP Arjun Ranawat do to us?
Don't you read the newspapers?
 If not, start reading them.
Because of the leak
 in Jaiswal report...
...a DGP, a Commissioner and a dozen
 officers are rotting in custody.
Damage has been done to them,
 you understand?
Listen, Kashiji.
 Arjun is digging into our nexus...
...with the underworld.
If he succeeds in establishing
 that nexus then...
...it would dig a grave for
 us and the underworld.
Try and get that report at any cost.
If that report goes to Delhi...
...then all of us will be behind bars.
And if...
Badri, those forged documents
 that are being printed in our press...
...that should be given to
 me tomorrow. - Yes brother.
Now regarding that
 report by Arjun Ranawat...
...that report would
 be on the table of...
...Chief Minister Kashinath Trivedi,
 tomorrow morning.
Do you remember something.
 ACP Arjun Ranawat.
I told you that one day
 I'll occupy this chair.
And that you'll salute me.
Do you remember?
You are mistaken Kashi Trivedi.
I've saluted this
 constitutional position...
...and not you.
Those who sit on this
 chair keep coming and going.
Stay within your status.
From today I'm your master
 and you're my servant.
I'm a public servant
 and any one else.
Tell me what did you call me for.
The listen.
I've kept the Home
 ministry with myself.
The data bank on
 the Mumbai mafia...
...that you have compiled...
...give it to me.
I knew it.
You'll want this which deals about
 those who helped you reach till here.
Take it. Keep it safe.
Confidential...
So this is the real stuff?
You must have worked
 very hard to compile this?
Saw how it burnt it
 to ashes in a moment?
You must be feeling
 bad about it. Isn't it?
No, but you will.
Maybe you'll have a heart attack
Because one copy of this has been
 sent to the central Home ministry...
...and the second to
 the Presidents office...
...and the third to
 the Prime minister's office.
Your Mafia friends can't escape now.
You tout for Zafar Supari.
What did you say?
 You called me a tout?
You called Kashi a tout?
You called the CM a tout?
You small time police officer,
 what is your status?
What do you think you are?
Kashi Trivedi, when the
 bones break at this age...
...then it is difficult
 to set them back.
Take your hands of me.
Now I'll show you your status.
You beat up the CM! You beat the CM.
No, a patriotic and
 honest public servant...
...has beaten up a traitor and
 a dishonest public servant.
Kashi Trivedi,
 my name is Arjun Ranawat.
To me death is like a pillow
 and a coffin is like a bed.
Jai Hind!!
Yes 555, what is the news?
Who Arjun sir? - No, I'm Haider Ali
 speaking. Tell me.
The young girls
 brought for flesh trade...
...from all parts of India...
...have been hidden in a place
 behind the railway yard.
Then they will be sent to
 different brothels in Mumbai.
You please save them sir.
Don't worry, we'll go
 there and save them all.
Please don't kill me sir. Leave me.
There is nobody here.
Was news given by 555 false sir?
Is this a trap? - Yes.
This is a trap.
A trap for all of you to die.
Zafar Supari, You?
Yes it's me. I'm in India.
See around you.
Encounter specialist,
 I'll do the encounters today.
Yours, Your friend Arjun Ranawat's...
...and that of the whole Mumbai city.
See, I've brought 500 tones of RDX.
Turn around and see.
It's good that you have brought
 your own pyre to burn yourself.
Instead you burning
 the city of Mumbai...
...you'll be burnt by me,
 Haider Ali Khan.
We have been trapped sir.
Five of our colleagues are dead.
We have no option but to retreat.
This is not the time
 to retreat, friends.
This is the time to pay back our
 debt to this uniform we wear.
Today all of us will
 pay back that debt.
How much ammos are we left with.
Last magazine sir.
Friends, our prime target is
 the RDX brought by Zafar Supari.
I'm moving towards that direction.
Any doubts?
No Sir.
No.
Oh God.
Haider.
You came to bury Mumbai in the
 ashes of the explosion you planned.
Now I, Haider Ali would bury you in
 the ashes of the explosion of your RDX.
Awasti you! A traitor!
Yes.
Haider Ali.
Hello.
 - Yes, Maharashtra Police Services.
Go to old Jassai railway yard...
...where the corpses
 of your brother Haider...
...and other colleagues of
 yours are waiting for you.
Haider.
Haider.
'The uniform is our pride'
'The uniform is our faith'
'The uniform is our identity'
'The uniform is our God.'
'I bequeath this birth to my nation.'
'We are proud'
'of our nation'
I am very sorry to
 inform the press that...
...Haider Ali Khan, a brave
 officer the crime control squad...
...was a secret agent operating for
 Pakistan and the underworld.
Pakistan and the
 underworld together...
...had planned for a repeat serial
 bomb explosion in Mumbai.
Inspector Haider Ali
 was helping them...
...to bring 500 tones
 of RDX into Mumbai.
Yesterday, Inspector
 Awasti reached the spot...
...and destroyed the
 dangerous mission.
Not only did Awasti destroy
 the RDX but also killed...
...the traitor Haider Ali Khan
 and his accomplices.
During our raids at
 Haider Ali's residence...
...we have got some floppies,
 foreign bank accounts...
...forged passports and visas...
...and some ISI identity cards.
These are proofs of his having
 been a Pakistani agent.
Zafar Supari.
What am I doing?
I had vowed not to
 discuss this with anybody.
But today I've broken my vow.
No.
What is this man saying?
Samar Singh has
 resigned his police job...
...and is going to fight Ranawat's
 case. He has filed a suit in court.
What is so alarming in this?
Everybody knows that Samar Singh
 is also a lawyer.
But he is also an emotional lawyer.
But we are professional lawyers...
...experienced in proving
 true as false and false as true.
Let it be. - But we should be...
Mr. Kashi. The false evidences
 that we have and...
...the charge sheet I've made
 is so strong and fool proof...
...that leave aside Samar Singh...
...even God can't save Arjun Ranawat
 from death penalty.
The game is over.
You honor, I would like
 to present the officers...
...who have been working with Arjun
 Ranawat for the past 15 years.
These witnesses will tell us that...
...who Arjun Ranawat is and
 what his character is like.
And what the truth is.
Permission granted.
Your honor, this is
 that Arjun Ranawat...
...who is considered as
 the lion of Mumbai.
The mafia gangs would just
 pee after hearing his name.
Sir, he's that Arjun Ranawat
 by whose fear...
...these underworld people
 were not only forced...
...to leave the city but the country.
Your honor, if in the police
 force there weren't...
...officers like Arjun
 and Haider Ali...
...then these mafias would
 have made the police...
...their pimps and the Mumbai
 city their whore house.
But this is the misfortune
 of this country...
...that one was killed
 by humiliation while...
...performing his duties
 and the other...
...is standing in this witness box.
I would like to call Arjun
 Ranawat's mother...
...that is Shakuntla Devi
 in the witness box.
Permission granted.
Mrs. Shakuntla Devi, tomorrow
 when the court will declare...
...your son to be a traitor
 and sentence him to death...
...then won't you be ashamed
 of being his mother?
Won't you regret it?
Regret! I'll regret that why
 didn't I give him birth.
I'll regret that why didn't every
 mother of this country...
...didn't give birth
 to a son like Arjun.
Not regret, but I'll be
 proud of Arjun's death.
The same pride which Bhagatsingh's
 mother felt...
...on the day of Bhagatsingh's
 execution.
Every country men
 would have felt it.
Your honor, not in this
 life but in every life...
...I would like to live and
 die as Arjun's mother.
Wow! What a speech! Astonishing!
 Incredible!
But I would like to remind
 the court that this case...
...is just a simple murder case.
 And the criminal...
...has already admitted his crime.
And your honor, I also want
 my friend to know...
...that cases are fought with
 evidence and witnesses.
But not with speeches
 and dramatics.
Then your honor, when his mother
 has already compared...
...him to be as Bhagatsingh then
 to save the humiliation...
...to that great martyr I have
 no other choice but to...
...unveil a truth after which
 each and every mother...
...and sister of this world would
 like to drown in shame.
And this mother... she'll
 feel that the ground...
...has suddenly slipped away
 from under her feet.
Okay Mrs. Shakuntla
 Devi, tell the court...
...that on the night
 of 1st of November...
...where was your daughter Rakhi?
Answer me, Shakuntla Devi on
 the night of the murder...
...your daughter and his so called
 sister... where was she?
Answer me, where was she?
Then you only tell
 me Arjun Ranawat...
...on the night of 1st of November...
...where was your so called
 sister, Rakhi Dixit?
Answer me, Arjun Ranawat.
 Why are you so quiet?
You can't answer this question
 and neither your mother.
I'll answer this question.
Your honor, on the night
 of 1st of November his...
...sister, a slut, a tramp and
 a woman of loose character...
...was at the chief minister's
 farm house.
Making merry with the
 deputy CM, Munna Trivedi...
...police commissioner's son...
...and many such people.
She was a high society
 call girl, your honor.
She just didn't had illegitimate
 relations with many men...
...but also with his so
 called brother Arjun Ranawat.
She was his sister by day
 and her keep by the night.
Just a filthy keep.
Tyagi!
Arjun! No Arjun!
He has started to beat him up.
 - Someone stop him.
Hold him! Hold him!
Arjun! No, my son.
Arjun, I'm telling you
 stop it. Leave him.
You are under my oath.
Did you see, your honor?
He doesn't know any other
 way to choke the truth.
He cannot see anyone else
 having indecent relation...
...with Rakhi but himself.
On the night of 1st of November
 when he found...
...his keep-sister with not one
 but three men on the bed...
...then he lost his control
 just like this.
And then he slaughtered
 everyone there.
Samarsingh, one more inappropriate
 action...
...from your client like this and
 I'll be forced to stop this...
...proceeding and come
 to a conclusion.
Today's proceeding is stopped here.
Tomorrow's proceeding will be
 held in the presence of...
...paramilitary force and
 the people who are...
...concerned with this case.
Bastard! Scoundrel!
If I wasn't obstructed
 by the law today...
...then I would have shot that Tyagi.
By presenting Rakhi in
 the court tomorrow...
...I'll clear all the lies
 Tyagi has put up.
But Rakhi cannot come to the court.
Why? Why can't she come?
She'll have to come to
 the court tomorrow.
But sir, she is in a deep shock
 due to Arjun's actions.
Since she got the news she
 just won't react to anyone.
She is being treated at the St.
 Mary's sanitarium in Khandala.
There is definitely some secret
 that Arjun is hiding from me.
Don't be so silent. Tell me, Rakhi.
What was the reason behind
 that manslaughter?
One of your brother, Haider Ali
 has died a humiliating death.
And the other one is
 charged with treason.
Will you be able to bear
 that your brother Arjun...
...is sentenced to death?
Will you able to live after
 hearing that your brother...
...is a despicable and
 disgraceful person.
Hey, stone hearted woman,
 will you be able to bear...
...the people's blame that you had...
...an indecent relation
 with your brother.
Will you be able to listen that
 you are Arjun's keep?
No!
Tell me clearly, child,
 what the truth is.
Maybe I'll be able to
 save Arjun's life.
Tell me, what the truth is.
I'll tell you uncle.
I'll tell you what the truth is.
Your honor, these are some
 documents which I'm going...
...to give to the chief minister
 and the police commissioner.
Just watch carefully.
So chief minister, what
 do you have in your hand?
They are the pamphlets
 of my election propaganda.
And this is my news paper,
 'Mera Bharat Mahan.'
Can you tell us where
 are they printed?
At my own printing press in Nagpur.
So police commissioner, what
 do you have in your hand?
This? They are the documents
 from Pakistan which mention...
...that Haider and Arjun
 are ISI agents.
According to the reports given
 by laboratory experts...
...the ink used in printing these
 documents from Pakistan...
...is the same as the
 chief minister's...
...newspaper, 'Mera Bharat Mahan.'
Now only two points can
 be noted out, your honor.
Either chief minister's newspaper
 'Mera Bharat Mahan'...
...is printed in Pakistan. Or
 documents from Pakistan...
...are printed in his
 own printing press...
...which is in Maharashtra, India.
Your honor, these two great people...
...forgot this small point.
And to prove Arjun and
 Haider to be traitors...
...in their own printing press
 they printed these...
...fake documents of Pakistan.
Arrest them.
Your honor, he's trying to change
 the direction of this case.
Because this case isn't a case
 of forgery but of murder.
And no one can change the truth that
 the guilty has killed 18 people.
Does his lawyer have any evidence...
...which will prove that this
 murder wasn't a crime.
I have that evidence, your honor.
Then present that evidence
 and prove Arjun innocent.
Why are you so silent?
 Show us the evidence.
I have the evidence, but I can't
 present it in the court.
Do you know that this statement...
...may also result the guilty
 being sentenced with death penalty.
Yes sir.
Sentence Arjun to death.
I'm asking you for the last time,
 what was the reason for the murder.
Answer me, Mr. Samarsingh.
Sentence him to death. I
 can't tell the reason.
Your honor, I will tell
 you the reason.
No, Rakhi! You go back.
I'm telling you, go back Rakhi.
You under my oath, Rakhi. Go back.
You are under the oath of your
 mother, back off from this hell.
No brother.
Neither any promise nor any
 God can stop me today...
...from telling the truth
 of our relationship.
Don't be a fool, Rakhi.
 You'll be ruined.
Let me be ruined.
Today I will tell what the truth is.
Your honor, on the night
 of 1st of November...
...brother of this CM, deputy
 CM Badrinath Trivedi...
...underworld don Zafar Supari,
 inspector Avasthi...
...son of this commissioner
 and his men...
...kidnapped me and took
 me to their farmhouse.
Your honor, to rape me.
 To gang rape me.
No, please! Brother!
Come to me!
 - No! - Take Inspector.
Brother!
 - C'mon, get up!
Help me!
I'm Zafar Supari. If you have
 the guts then come to the...
...CM's farmhouse and stop your
 sister from being raped.
This is the truth of that night.
Now you know why my brother
 has kept his silence...
...and wished for a death penalty.
Just wait.
You honor, I'm a soldier.
I don't want a mercy life.
My only wish is either
 victory or be a martyr.
Give me a death penalty.
Because I'll come back again.
And to save the pride
 of my country...
...I'll pick up weapons again.
Because Arjun had always
 taken up weapons...
...in the past, the present
 and the future.
This court hear by orders
 to file a case against...
...the chief minister,
 Kashinath Trivedi...
...and commissioner Deshpande
 on counts of treason.
And with that, the one who took
 up weapon for the safety...
...of the society Arjun
 Ranawat is declared...
...free from all charges against him.
Long Live Arjun Ranawat!
