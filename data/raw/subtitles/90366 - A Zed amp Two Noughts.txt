ABOUT THE SUBTITLES: Some words are
missing. If you are able to figure them out
please do so and upload the file again
as Version 2, Version 3 etc... Thank you!
A swan?
What sort of a swan?
Leda?
Who is Leda?
Is she the injured woman?
Laid by whom?
By Jupiter?
Was that the cause of death?
A female swan?
How do you know
it was female?
Eggs?
Egg-bound?
Was it bold?
Perhaps it was a goose.
Did it come from the zoo?
How fast does a
woman decompose?
Six months. Maybe a year.
Depends on the conditions.
Does being pregnant
make any difference?
No!
And the baby?
- How far gone was she?
- Perhaps ten weeks.
Then, you'd never know.
I cannot stand the idea
of her rotting away.
What is the first
thing that happens?
The first thing that happens is
bacteria set to work in the intestine.
- What sort of bacteria?
- Bisocosis populi.
There is suppose to
be 130.000 bisocosis
in each lick of
a human tongue.
250.000 in a French kiss...
First exchange at the very beginning
of creation when Adam kissed Eve.
I suppose Eve kissed Adam.
Unlikely!
She used her first
100.000 on the apple.
If the evolutionary
span of life on Earth
is represented by
a year of 365 days,
then man made
his first appearance
on the evening of
the 31st of December...
just as the daylight was fading.
It had taken some...
4.000 million years
for the entrance to be made.
A very slow, uneven
progress of life forms,
changing and evolving in a
long, continuous ???.
It's ??? to the
easy to comprehend
how one species
gave way to another.
But perhaps more
difficult to understand...
the evolutionary leap, necessary
to bridge the most
sophisticated of the apes...
with man.
And more difficult, still...
to contemplate how
life can create itself,
apparently, out of nothing.
The conditions for the
origin of life on Earth
can never be reproduced again.
The atmosphere is
now rich in oxygen,
the necessary ingredient for the
respiratory life of all animals.
But in the beginning
there was little or no oxygen.
There was methane, ammonia,
carbon monoxide, water,
electrical storms,
ultraviolet light,
the first carbon compounds.
On the round volcanic stones like
these... an abundance of hydrogen.
These conditions
were advantageous
for the formation of
the first cyanophycees
or blue-green algae.
Their utilization of hydrogen
in water using chlorophyll
in the process of
photosynthesis
liberated oxygen
in abundant quantities
to change radically the
atmosphere of the Earth.
Their evolving marks a major step
towards the evolution
of higher forms of life.
How are you feeling?
Short of a leg.
In the land of the legless...
the one-legged woman is queen.
It was a legless whore in
Marseilles during the war...
who was very wealthy.
She seldom left her
bed because she couldn't.
She got both her legs
amputated at the brim.
Imagine that gentlemen...
no limbs to hint the entry…
She was treated with great
affection and regard…
and had a great many lovers.
She died young...
Some of her lover thought...
she might liked to be
buried in a short coffin.
Others thought that the empty
space should be filled with flowers.
In the end, of course,
her family turned up
and they had the corpse
fitted with artificial legs.
Imagine that...
the body... in all its
delicious detail...
fading away...
leaving a skeleton
with iron legs...
Especially, since the legs had been
made for a man called Felipe Arc-en-Ciel.
You've been very
thorough in your research.
I made it up.
I have now to find a Felipe
Arc-en-Ciel to stop my crying...
to discover what it tastes
to have your legs borrowed
by a dead woman.
How is your daughter?
Beta is fine.
She says, my leg has
walked off with a Dutchman.
Morning Venus!
How are the zebras?
Black and white.
Good morning Milo!
What do you doing?
Just come to see if you are
looking after the animals properly.
You can come and
take care of me.
Where could I do that?
Back of the panda cages...
we might give them
a little encouragement.
There's no bed there.
Since when have you
needed a bed, Milo?
Since my back
ached... just now!
I'll give you...
£5…
and 2 pounds of zebra steak.
Do the owls go hungry
for your pleasure?
Not yours!
I was on that pheasant.
They'll eat anything, even a lizard.
Would you rather have a
lizard... or a zebra afterbirth?
Tell me Milo!
Do you think a zebra...
is a white animal
with black stripes
or a black animal
with white stripes?
Carry my shoes for me.
There used to be a bed in
the back of the vulture cages.
You were younger then...
Now you have less to bargain with.
- Now I have experience.
- With animals?
All right then!
I'll give 4 pounds of
cow's liver... and a drink.
Or I might have to see about
your license to practise.
??? to have a license
to start the zoo, not to stock it.
You could start a zoo, Hoyten.
But you'd have to
pay me to visit you.
You can keep your free meat.
I'll take a... £10 for
half an hour...
and the tail feathers of
an American bold eagle.
You're making a hat?
No!
I'm writing a dirty story.
We don't have an
American bold eagle.
Oh, I was forgetting it,
the black and white ???.
Then I'll settle for an introduction
to Oliver and Oswald.
What do you want with them?
I could help!
Their wives have died…
and I need a bath.
You can have a bath,
provided I can watch.
Surprise, surprise!
That's what all the animals
are here for, isn't it?
In a spoonful of ??? water
there may be as many as
10.000 minor microorganisms...
In the seas there are uncountable
numbers of creatures.
Myriads of simply
structured organisms,
whose ancestors began to appear
some... 2.000 million years ago
from among the primitive
bacteria and the first algae.
Oliver, I'm sorry
about your bad news.
Can the zoo help?
What are you watching?
The beginnings of life.
- Is cathartic.
- What is?
Watching life begin.
- Yes?
- Yes!
'Cause I know how it ends.
- How does it end?
- With a swan.
- Ah, yes!
- And a white car...
a Ford Mercury,
registration number NID26BW
driven by a woman
with flaming red hair,
surrounded by white
feathers, called Alba Bewick.
Then I'm sorry that you'll
find this film... inaccurate.
Don't ruin it for me, Fallast.
I'm going to take it in stages.
Needs absorbing...
Sure, I must have read it wrong before
and now I'm on the lookout for clues.
What sort of clues?
In a trying to separate the
true clues and the red herrings.
I'm told, that all 8 parts of
the second copy of this film
are out on the ??? as well.
Perhaps someone else is
also looking for red herring.
Myriads of simply
structured organisms,
whose ancestors began to appear
some... 2.000 million years ago
from among the primitive
bacteria and the first algae.
Protozoa, primitive jelly fish,
sponges, coral polyps, colonizers...
Innumerable individuals making
the first oceans... a rich soup.
Ripe for the further and more
sophisticated development...
of life forms.
Oliver, entre!
Where is Oswald?
Ah, he's... just working.
Work consoles him.
I think.
How did you first know my wife?
I met her at the zoo...
with my daughter...
when I took to Beta to the
Insects House to watch butterflies.
Your wife said...
they should be let free.
She didn't approve
of zoos, did she?
Why is your daughter called Beta?
Alpha, Beta, Gamma...
I wanted 26 children.
Beta wasn't the first.
The first one died.
I had an infection...
mercury poisoning.
Where I come from, you take
mercury to put you an abortion.
There aren't 26 letters in the
Greek alphabet, there's only 23.
What Oswald Deuce's doing here?
Watching an apple fade away.
How original...
- "A" is for...
- Angelfish.
- "B" is for...
- Butterfly.
Do you think that's wise?
There are too many of them.
Will they survive the cold?
This zoo is too crowded.
There're too many staff,
for a start.
Haven't you got anything
better to do than watch me?
Venus de Milo's been
asking after you.
I cannot stand the idea of
her body rotting away...
for nothing.
Or was it for some reason?
Where is this?
It's where I was born.
It's called L'Escargot.
Tell me what happened...
in detail.
You know what happened.
Paula and Griselda
were shopping for china...
What was Griselda wearing?
A green hat, black shoes...
- We left there about 3 o' clock.
- Was she wearing a scarf?
Yes!
We turned out of the
car parking and then…
Why was she buying china?
She said she needed china.
She bought 6 soup-bowls…
What were they like?
They were white...
with blue markings...
and an egg-timer...
and a milk-jug.
An egg-timer... What the hell
did she want with an egg-timer?
- I imagine those vaulty timers...
- And why did she want to time eggs?
Oswald, think what you say!
What else did she buy?
Paula wanted to go
to the fishmonger.
- I bought a lobster.
- Why did you buy a lobster for?
Oswald, this is getting silly!
Did my wife buy anything?
Oh yes... prawns.
- Prawns?
- Yes!
Thank you!
That will do for now.
But all this is the long
way back in the story.
Oh well! Thank you for telling me.
Oswald, where are you going?
The variety of shape,
form and structure
in the development
of animals at this time
is extraordinary.
Slight scuffing crabs,
slow moving snails,
animals that look like stones,
that take on the colour of sand,
animals that presented claws,
that scavenge,
that develop poisons
and stinging apparatus,
that live on detritus
and each other…
creating systems of defence and
attack whose ???.
Anything in the park gazette?
- Why don't you sit down, plead?
- Thank you a lot Oliver!
I heard you were in here.
- There's a funny smell in here.
- It's me...
I've stop washing.
- Now, I'm sorry very about your wife.
- So am I.
Venus de Milo has
been asking after you.
Everyone's pimp and
messenger, right plead?
Suit yourself!
Milo, have you ever
done it with animals?
If that's what you want,
if it would help...
I could invent for you.
It'll cost a... £5 a story.
That's what Anais Nin
charged in 1927...
and she did it professionally.
I haven't started professionally, yet.
£5 or... an introduction
to a publisher.
- Or credit note to a large bookshop...
- That's all right! All right, go on!
Once upon a time...
there were three birds...
No nursery stories!
No? All right!
Circus owner in Anchorage...
kept a polar bear called Fairbanks
to entertain Eskimo wives...
- Unlikely! And how come
you know about Alaska?
I was attentive in Geography.
The bear... had a narrow snout,
a sweet nature, and a
rough and probing tongue.
It also liked honey…
It's beginning to sound
like a bedtime story.
Isn't that just
what you wanted?
And there are no bees in Alaska.
There are as many
bees in Alaska as snails.
Why do you like snails?
They're a nice primitive form of life.
They helped the world decay...
and they are hermaphrodites, they
can satisfy their own sexual needs.
- I don't believe it!
- Neither do I!
The circus owner by leashing
out the bear with a jar of honey
had two profitable
sources of income...
Come on! Now this is another
wingding story about money!
- And I disapprove of circuses!
- I disapprove of zoos!
Just shut up and get out!
But I haven't got to
the erotic part yet.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Oh, mind your snails!
Out!
Get out! Go on!
Out!
If you go down
to the woods today...
you'd better go in disguise.
If you go down
to the woods today...
be sure of...
Be careful with that,
you shithead idiot!
It's ???. I spent
a lot of time on this suit.
If you go down to the woods today
you'd better go in disguise.
If you go down
to the woods today...
be sure of a big surprise.
What sort of stories does
your brother Oswald like?
Why don't you
go and ask him?
At 6 o'clock... their
mummies and daddies...
will take them home to bed...
because they're tired...
little... teddy bears.
And leave those little snails
alone, you dirty old man.
And oh, Lord!
This Oswald Deuce again!
What's he up to?
What's the connection
between apples and prawns?
What the ??? of
prawns remind you of?
And what was the betting?
All of Oswald wives smell like ???
Maybe he enjoined the smell
of ??? cunt and recaptured it.
You're disgusting!
You are too prim for words…
Make him eat a prawn!
Oswald wouldn't mind.
Take that off.
Put this on.
It belongs to my wife.
And this hat.
??? the coat down front.
Fold your arms.
All right, begin!
In Bostwana, they
kept a bull in a cave…
I've heard it.
You have?
Well!
In the 1870s, in the
Regent's Park Zoo in London...
there was an enclosure reserved...
for certain rare animals.
They came to be called...
The Obscene Animals Enclosure.
One of the animals,
in this special enclosure,
was a toad...
at least it had
the body of a toad.
Was it all your bloody fault?
- What was?
- The death of my wife!
I see.
I'm expected to
have a pilot's license?
How could I anticipate swans?
You're wearing
white feathers...
and you were driving
a Ford Mercury.
So?
You were asking for trouble.
Why?
You said you took mercury
to procure an abortion.
You were pregnant.
How the hell did you know
I was pregnant?
Pregnant women are
notoriously unreliable.
Especially, when they're
trying to procure an abortion.
It was all your fault, you bitch!
Oliver!
Was my story worth £10?
I normally get 25
for 4.000 words.
That's 1/8 of what Corrine
??? got for "The Story of O".
- Did I tell it well?
- Yes!
Write it down and I'll
see if it gets published.
That's what your brother said.
Is it?
Isn't it time you and he
became a little more friendly?
How is he?
He's miserable...
like you.
Oliver says, that rot
starts in the stomach.
With an apple?
In the intestines,
in the liver, pancreas...
the spleen... near the womb...
I'm going to see Oliver.
Do you want me to
give him a message?
No, I've got nothing to say.
Yes, tell him...
to look after himself.
Oliver!
Oliver, what...
what are you doing?
I'm having breakfast.
Stop it, you bloody idiot!
You pathetic idiot!
It's only ice.
Ice floats and you don't
put ice in your wine.
Since when is that
???
Oh, all right! Call for an
ambulance, I've had enough.
Thank you!
- Shall I call to Oswald?
- No!
All right, yes!
Tell him...
I am bleeding.
He'll come.
He always used to come
when I was bleeding.
- What's Oliver looking for?
- I don't know.
I mean, look at all this stuff.
Maybe he's looking for an
answer to his wife's death.
He will not find it here.
This is just a straight forward ???.
The squid is among the most
intelligent of the invertebrates.
Darwin was a good story-teller.
Both brothers
have taken one copy.
Do I got to sit
through them all?
There are 8 parts.
This is only the third.
God, it's all such a...
very fiction!
Were right...
Oh, I do deserve this ???.
How was he right?
I was pregnant.
I not only lost
a leg in that crash.
I lost a child.
Though I wasn't,
by any means, trying to.
Gamma is not a very
good name for a child.
I have yet to work out
my greater loss.
But I know that I want
another leg and another child.
As you can see...
it was inferior china.
Why do you want
to keep those for?
Throw them away,
you stupid boy!
I'd like to see this place.
Then go and see it...
and come back and tell me
how it's ???.
The key is in my bag.
You could go together.
So who found you?
- De Milo.
- Who is she?
The ??? Venus,
the clients call de Milo.
The seamstress.
She's beautiful stitcher.
When she's not
watching the zebras,
she meets her clients
at the Panda House.
And what's her speciality?
Bamboo.
- "J" is for...
- Jaguar.
- "K" is for...
- Kangaroo.
- "L" is for...
- Lion.
- "M" is for...
- Monkey.
Mon dieu, Oswald!
What's this?
Prawns on their way back.
Way back?
To where they came from.
Ooze...
slime, murk...
One's still alive.
- Something interfered with my experiment.
- Perhaps they were hungry.
Who the hell is he?
He's the surgeon,
who removed my leg.
He wants to be a painter...
a Dutch painter.
In fact, the Dutch
painter Vermeer. No less!
Vermeer only painted 26 paintings
and 3 of those are dubious.
- That's enough.
- Obviously not!
Van Meegeren tried
to paint some more.
- That's his name!
- Whose name?
- The surgeon's.
- Pardon?
Van Meegeren.
He's the cousin of the fake
??? painted by Vermeer.
What's his speciality?
Vermeer women.
Van Meegeren says, I look like
the lady standing at the virginal.
I suspect it's because
you never see her legs.
She's not standing really.
She's strapped and stitched
to ???.
Van Meegeren has a great
reputation for stitching.
Stitching?
Suturing.
Sewing up wounds...
operations...
He's made a beautiful job on me.
- Look.
- No, I can't.
- Why not?
- Because...
You see what I mean?
I see more than that.
Oh! That, well...
That's pretty
redundant now, isn't it?
I mean, except
to pee through.
I want you to make sure
those two brothers don't
get too close to Alba Bewick.
How do I do that?
Distract them...
as only you know how.
What's in it for me?
My patient's ???.
Our patient's that'd be.
and a... continuant place
in my operating theatre...
and in my bed.
Oliver!
I was thinking...
at the crush... which way
was the wind blowing?
??? of the
buildings at the north side
or the buildings
on the south side?
Stop ???
??? enough!
You've got to stop!
What difference does it make?
You exhaust me with your
obsessions. Both of you!
You're our only witness.
What sort of witness was I?
??? pain..
a face full of feathers...
an egg yolk...
my leg's matched to pulp...
bleeding...
and you ask me
for wind directions.
Sorry!
- Where's Beta?
- She's with Oswald.
Look! It was an accident.
5.000 accidents happen every day.
- This one is...
- Bizarre, tragic, fascicle!
They're acts of God!
Did only to amaze the survivors...
and irritate the
insurance company.
This one is different,
for God's sake!
Is it?
The wives of two zoologists die in a
car driven by a woman called Bewick,
who's attacked by a
swan on Swan's Way...
You are ??? the beginning to build
yourself a case for the supernatural.
But another set of details,
from the same crash,
could produce something
completely different.
What about me?
Don't I deserve some
consideration?
With a daughter, who can't
seat still... and why should she?
Take her out for me, will you?
Van Meegeren is going to fit me
with an artificial leg tomorrow.
Kiss me.
I haven't been kissed since your
wife kissed me one month ago.
Kiss me on the cheek.
Here... where she did.
And the ostrich
eats anything ???...
It buries its head in the
sand when it's afraid...
And the elephant lives to be a 100...
And never forgets a face...
So, you see between us...
we know everything.
You don't know everything.
Between us we do.
All right then!
You see that
woman over there?
What colour knickers
is she wearing?
- Red ones, like her hat.
- No, she isn't.
- How do you know?
- I know.
Well, Oliver...
You could always go
and ask... to find out.
Go on, ask her!
Excuse me, madam!
I'm sorry to bother you. I think
we may just have met before.
May I trouble you in the interest
of that child's education.
May I ask you a few questions?
Like?
Like? Uh...
Are these ostrich feathers?
Who are you exactly?
Do I know you?
I'm an animal behaviourist,
madam.
Then your question doesn't
sound very well informed.
What animals are
you behaving, mister?
All animals! Madam...
can I ask you a
personal question?
Which do you prefer...
What colour are your knickers?
- Black and white striped.
- Thank you!
It's a pleasure!
You see! Black
and white stripes.
You didn't know.
I knew all the time.
- You did?
- Yes, I saw them yesterday.
And why did you make me
go through all that, then?
Excuse me!
Just in case you don't
believe me, I can show you.
No, thank you very much!
We believe you.
- I insist!
- It's really quite all right.
Thank you!
If you are both zoologists
as you claim...
you ??? yourself and your
powers of observation.
You must continue
these experiments.
If you don't look at the evidence,
you cheat on ???.
Come with me or...
I swear...
I'll ??? this table over.
Go on in!
God!
And now I'll knock over this one
if you don't go with me at once.
All right! All right!
Where to?
Just follow me.
???, move!
Thanks very much!
All right smart zoologist.
Now see for yourself.
Go on!
That will cost you £40...
and there is another thing...
Van Meegeren and I believe...
it's better for you and
your precious brother
not to see Alba Bewick...
before it's too late.
Too late?
If you both feel so lonely,
you can't help yourself...
come and see me.
Together, if you must.
And I don't tell dirty stories.
Don't press too hard.
My back aches.
Where does it ache?
It was the hips...
and along the spine.
Don't worry! It's a
natural ???.
Let's have you in
a seating position.
- Tell me. What happened to my leg?
- What do you mean?
Where is it now?
Have you sold it?
It was incinerated.
Where?
Don't concern
yourself with it.
Where?
In the hospital incinerator.
What is your connection
with the zoo?
I am veterinarian consultant.
Why do you ask?
Do you perform
amputations on animals?
If they are necessary.
Do you fit animals
with artificial legs?
Where are these
questions leading, Alba?
Is animal surgery so
different from human surgery?
There are many similarities.
What's this for?
It's for a surprise.
What sort of a surprise?
Don't be alarmed.
I'm sure you'll like it.
What sort of surprise
will it be if we tell you?
You take too many liberties.
I do! They're all
in your interest.
- Is that a real angelfish?
- Yes!
Can it fly?
Well it could... it still couldn't
escape. It's a caged fish.
- Can it swim away?
- But where to swim to?
The Sargasso sea.
That's where all fish go.
Is it?
Yes! That's where
mother's leg has gone.
How come?
It was taken by a shark.
Call him Van Meegeren,
perhaps...
Who's he?
Oh... just a keeper of legs.
Do you keep legs
and ??? fish?
- Yes!
- Zebra-fish?
We also have... parrot-fish,
elephant-fish...
rat-fish and tiger-sharks.
You see, fish anticipated
everything that was to come.
I don't know why even
it's involved to go on...
- Why go further?
- There are no swan-fish.
Oliver?
I mean... Oswald?
What do you doing
here so late?
Reptiles.
I want to tell you about...
Seat here.
Reptiles differ from
??? amphibian ancestors
by having a skin capable
of retaining body moisture.
Which meant that animals
for the first time...
Isn't it a bit late to
be watching reptiles?
A forty million years to that.
What's all this watching for?
We're trying to work it out.
What out?
Why we should come all this
way... slowly and painfully...
inch by inch, fraction by
fraction, second by second...
so that my wife
should die by a swan?
Very personal
view of evolution.
What of a swan and my
wife got in common?
- Me!
- You?
And my car, an amputated
leg, my lost child....
Before the vast majority
of reptiles by now…
Reptiles didn't die out.
They grew feathers
and became birds.
So our swan was
a flying lizard?
Did Jupiter know that
when he raped Leda?
He didn't raped her.
She was willing.
Mon Dieu, Oswald!
Are you implying I was?
What do you mean?
You've been trying to
tell me, you and Oliver,
that I was responsible
for your wives death.
No! We haven't!
And things have
suddenly changed.
Forcing the development of
new sexual apparatus...
Where is Oliver?
He's working.
He heaps stinking snails...
letting butterflies free.
He should go there.
It's full of snails
and butterflies.
If you left a bicycle
by the back door...
and you went indoors
to use the toilet...
when you came out... the
saddle was covered in snails...
licking up your sweat!
I haven't been there
for 15 years...
I'd quite like to die there.
You must go there for me.
You might find my
Felipe Arc-en-Ciel.
The key is in my bag.
Good Lord, Alba!
Which one?
I don't know!
I've forgotten.
You better try them all.
Start with this one.
It looks right.
Why did you keep all these?
I've always had them.
You must never throw a key
away. Did you know that?
Kiss me.
Crocodiles and their relatives,
the gharials, alligators and caimans...
- Your leg...
- What leg?
Don't be so sensitive.
You'd be surprised...
what a novelty it is.
Come on! I want
more than a kiss.
You might like it.
Your brother did!
What's the charge?
Charge...
The charge is £30.
Do you think the
zebra was a mistake?
Never!
Do you think that black
and white stripes are useful?
I'm sure they are.
Since the zebra is such
a beautiful animal...
you'd have thought that.
That man would have
invented a fanciful hybrid,
wouldn't you?
You know, like a... Centaur.
A black and white Centaur...
half woman, half zebra...
with striped breasts, ever-ready
haunches, and a white tail...
a black hair...
??? put it in the zoo.
Next to the Unicorn.
And the mermaid.
Animals are always
kept for profit.
Maybe that's what they are for.
There're many ways
of making a profit.
If I had the money
to own a zoo...
I would stock it with
mythological animals.
And where would
you find them?
It would ask you to help me.
Oh, I'm very expensive.
You don't seem to have protected Alba
from the attentions of Oliver and Oswald.
I can't control the
world like a sentry.
You could ??? for more effective
alternatives than a woman with one leg.
Would they be interested in
a woman with no legs at all?
Since you, obviously, put more
interest in her than you do in me
you ought to be able to
answer the question yourself.
Captain Hook had one leg...
It was his arm.
and Long John Silver.
They were both fictional,
so they don't count.
And Victor Hugo's father.
He wrote fiction so
he doesn't count.
It was a cork leg.
Really?
Oh, I wonder if he had that much
trouble having it fitted it as I am.
Next time you two
must come with me.
Why?
To protect to me from
unnecessary attentions.
What a ???.
Pinocchio's legs were wooden...
well... Toulouse-Lautrec...
He had legs...
they were just a little short.
Now, his father kept horses.
So? Marie Antoinette's
father kept pigs ???.
Marie Antoinette's
father didn't keep pigs...
Somebody's father did.
You two are improving,
aren't you?
??? one another?
Yeah, Beta...
Shall we jump in now or later?
How'd we taste like?
Grief doesn't flavour anything.
It's just sour.
- Excuse me! Can I have a word with you?
- Go ahead!
Wouldn't you like to
speak to me alone?
- No!
- Oh, dear!
Grief is a great healer.
I hear you might be looking
for some dead animals.
I may be.
Well, what exactly
are you looking for?
Reptiles.
- ??? a bit bigger then?
- Not yet.
Would a crocodile do?
Well, it might but I'm
unlikely to find one.
- How much would you pay?
- Pay? I haven't thought.
Well, with the insurance money
and that, you're not badly ???
That's none of your business.
- £40.
- That seems a lot.
All right! £35.
Where did you get that?
In a zoo community of 7.000 animals
there are deaths every day.
I mean crocodiles
are not immortal.
De Milo, with my instructions,
has made you a dress.
It's a copy in every detail of the
one worn by madam Van Heysen
both to "Concert" and
"The Music Lessons".
We now nearly have the entire
wardrobe seen in Vermeer's paintings.
I came for an artificial leg,
not an artificial dress.
Just to please me.
Milo, help Alba with ???.
Have you two met?
I know enough Milo...
to know that you favour black
and plan to earn
your living as a writer.
I know a publisher.
You must come and tell
me... some dirty stories.
Oh, what you would like?
I can tell you about...
what Venus did to the Unicorn
in Beardsley's "Under the Hill".
Milo...
He got paid 60 guineas.
Would you think 60
guineas was worth it?
Milo, put the dress up!
In this room, as you can see,
I am in use for holding pins.
Do I really have to?
Come on! Sit at the
piano. Can you play?
Nothing very complicated.
It needs a tack here.
There's nothing ???.
??? above the hair.
Let me out of here.
C'est terrible!
What's so terrible?
I'm an excuse for medical
experiments... and Art theory.
You must get me out of here
and out of the hospital.
They are trying to help you.
Help me, for God's shake!
What do you thinking?
I am staged... and
sewn to the music stool.
Look! I'm imprisoned!
This is one of the most
specialized of birds
which is evolved during
the past few million years
to exploit this one
particular environment.
Shallow ??? lakes and lagoons
swamp with microscopic life.
Milo!
It's beautiful!
Does Alba really know
what she's got here?
I'm sure of that.
Does she really know
what she's doing?
She's trying to start all over again.
By sleeping with two brothers
who can't tell the difference
between pleasure and grief and
take advantage of her loneliness?
My impression was she was
taking advantage of our loneliness.
So...
who's gaining most out of
this... neutral exploitation?
At the moment I am.
Why you?
'Cause I'm enjoying this!
You are here but worry
about exploitation...
and Alba is not here
but in bed without a leg.
Now, open your eyes.
We've not find you
a Felipe Arc-en-Ciel
but we have find
you an apartment.
Now you'll be safe
from Art and the Medicine.
It looks very expensive...
and a little bit vulgar.
It's certainly
convenient for the zoo.
And who's going
to pay for all this?
We are!
And here is a reminder
of how it really goes...
I see...
Exchanging one
prison for another...
but the music is
still the same.
- So, I am to be a kept woman?
- Not so you'd notice.
Will I be able to
escape if I want to?
Of course! You know
I don't believe in cages.
Suppose... I don't
want to escape...
Grief, Alba!
Free to come and
go as you please.
Good! Just want
to get that straight.
You know they clip the
wings of birds in the zoo.
Yeah! But they
always grow again.
Now that wasn't a such a blithe thing
to see in the circumstances, was it?
Sorry!
Who has the keys?
You can have the keys...
The keys are ???. Look!
You are as free as a bird!
Just like Leda.
Prove I am as free as a bird.
Prove it?
All right!
All right! You just
sit on your balcony
at 9 o' clock tomorrow
morning and I'll show you
how easy it is to free birds.
Ok!
Let's hear all the changes
in the face of new evidence...
I am about to become a mother...
and you are about to
become a father...
or fathers.
- You what?
- You are?
- I am!
- Good lord!
- Why not?
- You can?
Of course!
Is leglessness a
form of contraception?
- I'm not sure.
- You're not sure!
- I'm delighted!
- You are delighted!
A pregnant cripple
and you're delighted.
Think of what it will do
to my sense of balance!
It might help! Give
you more stability.
Then you recommend it?
Recommendation
is one thing.
A womb on crutches is another.
So... who's the father?
Well, well, well...
Why don't you discuss
it between yourselves?
Why, don't you know?
Grand Dieu!
Does an animal behaviourist
need to ask such questions?
As far as I'm concerned...
you both are.
- But you...
- No buts!
You're brothers, aren't you?
What's a few spermatozoa
among brothers!
Oliver!
Invigorating as the
sight may be to you,
perhaps, you can tell me...
something about their escape.
You think I should know?
I understand that you are critical
about my... custody of birds.
They look like twins.
Could they fly like that? Do you
think? Trying together like that?
We could learn them.
Could my fish learn?
I'm sure!
It's lonely.
I'll show you what to do.
Come with me!
Both the tiger and the zebra
carry their own prison bars.
But whereas the tiger stripes
undoubtedly service camouflage,
the stripes of the zebra
are now no longer believed
to be protective colouring.
The flamingo ???
crustaceans.
??? pink are the feathers.
Your birds are too pale.
Fresh prawns are
rather difficult to keep,
as I'm sure you understand.
The flamingo enclosure
is a 10 feet by 12.
You have 123 birds, which
gives each bird... 1 square feet.
A flamingo is not ???
standing on one of those feet.
There you are!
A mirror image.
It's not that impossible to find.
Flamingos never express a
temperature lower than 5 C.
Nor do they respect
traffic tickets.
Your fugitive cold...
and anaemic flamingos
??? look terribly ???
waiting for taxi, do they?
We've got it wrong.
They're waiting for a bus...
to Africa.
How charming!
Oliver, a warning:
Snails, butterflies and our birds
have escaped from the zoo.
I can't prove that you
are responsible Oliver...
but I'm sure my suspicions
are not too far from the truth.
Be careful!
I've got to go back
to the hospital.
Why?
- I'm going to lose the other one.
- Other what?
This one.
What's the
matter with you?
??? all right, doesn't it?
Of course it does!
What's wrong with it?
It's got to go.
Oh, you're joking!
You can't be serious!
You ??? my leg?
It's dying!
How could it be dying?
It's all on its own.
It's lonely.
You never see a female
leg in Vermeer.
Have you noticed?
Do you think it's a
conspiracy by Van Meegeren?
It's Van Meegeren who says,
"He's got to come off".
He says it ???
shock to the spine.
I'm getting so that
I can hardly move.
Feel it!
It's cold!
Don't you think?
Could you both love
this leg as much as me?
It's the only leg
I've got left.
How much of your body can you
lose and still recognize yourself?
Two legs look so good
together, don't you think?
They complement
one another.
It's as just they were
made for each other.
Like us.
Like your legs, Alba...
We are complementary.
Of course you are.
Oh! What's the name of the
piece at the back of the knee?
Hasn't got a name.
Oh! That I won't miss it!
??? another common
features haven't got a name
Like this small piece of gristle
that separates the nose.
It also keeps them together.
Why do we have to
have two nostrils?
Why do we have to have
two of everything?
- Symmetry ??? all.
- We are twins.
I know you are.
Just because you've chosen
now to reveal your amazing secret,
doesn't mean I
have to be surprised.
- Who told you?
- No one!
I guessed!
- Not even your wives told me.
- They didn't know.
They didn't know?
Come on!
They didn't know!
They knew we were brothers, but
they were never told that we were twins.
Well, now...
That is a surprise!
Well!
They can't torture me anymore
??? between my toes.
I can't be tickled to death
on the soles of my feet.
I can't be knee capped.
Or get ??? knee or athlete's foot.
- Or wear ???.
- You can get ??? on your hands.
Say good bye to my leg.
Both of you.
Bye, leg!
Go on, Oswald.
Good bye, leg!
Kiss it!
It needs a ???.
Here...
and here.
Come to the window.
Turn off the light.
What are you watching?
It's a ??? present...
to celebrate your return
to the zoo hotel.
I turned out the rhino.
It followed me to the corner.
- And then you abandoned it.
- It'll be all right.
- Suppose it will attack someone.
- It won't! It's short-sighted.
Carry me to the window.
I've never been to Africa.
The rhino seems able
to look after himself.
Take me back to bed!
Come and join me.
Now! How about
changing sides?
No, I'm happy on the left.
I exactly know my place and
feel very comfortable in it.
Though it's possibly
on this night
for the first time that I'm
prepared to acknowledge this.
Know your place!
Since before I was three.
You have a long memory.
And a few scars to prove it.
Bellow the ear.
At the shoulder.
Along the hip.
And along the ???.
Oswald and Oliver...
Siamese twins.
Why haven't you
acknowledged it before?
Maternal advice.
"Say nothing and
nobody will ever know".
But it's something special
to shout of it, isn't it?
Was it?
Freaks and rarities used
to be kept in the circuses.
Now that we're civilized
they're kept in zoos.
Our mother didn't like the
idea of us being a rare species.
In the zoo...
You have no right to
use zoo equipment...
for any old animal
you find in the street.
Especially not a
black and white one.
Not to die on by
a malicious ???
What is it, Hoyten, about
black and white animals
that you must preserve your
special animosity for them?
- Nothing!
- What did you say?
Unless you pay me a £200
for the use of that dog...
It's not yours to sell.
And if we can prove you
killed it, you will do the paying.
I should report this
misuse of zoo property...
to Fallast.
You do that.
I sit here for hours!
??? Sitting amongst
the lighthouses.
Each lighthouse is giving you a
bearing of lost spaces of time.
There're tens of thousands
of photographs taken here.
All taken very patiently.
Because decay
can be very slow.
Nine months for the
human body...
they say!
Why zebras...
always given for the last
letter of the alphabet?
Can you think of a better word?
What did they use for "Z"...
before they knew zebras existed?
That was so long ago,
nobody needed an alphabet.
I think the letter "Z" was
invented especially for zebras.
What is your name?
Why?
Felipe Arc-en-Ciel.
If you've got a ??? control of it,
I want to be buried here.
It's not consecrated ground.
Well! We could make
it consecrated ground.
I'll be cremated and you
can scatter my ashes here.
Snails don't like ashes.
They'll just have to
put up with them!
By the way, you still
owe me a cripple.
Pardon!
I said you could only come here,
if you find me a cripple to cherish...
and I expect you to find
him before I deliver.
Are we likely
to find him for you?
You intend to make
him push us out?
Push you out?
You are both zoologists.
I want you to be
there when I deliver.
It might cure you with
your obsession with decay.
Keep looking!
- "P" is for...
- Penguin.
- "Q" is for...
- Quagga.
- "R" is for...
- Rhinoceros.
- "S" is for...
- Swan.
I'm told Vermeer's
wife never sat for him.
Vermeer's wife, Catherina
Bolnes, gave him 14 children.
My Catherina
Bolnes is barren.
Your Catherina Bolnes...
She changed her name by
??? because  I asked it.
Oh dear, what an
influence you must have!
I understand that you
are now called... Leda?
It is an affectionate
joke with no strings.
I'm glad!
You glad?
Dear Alba...
I've been very close to you...
to the operating table.
With just a little encouragement
from you I could be as close again.
Take your arms off!
Come on! What excite???
a legless woman come by?
Enough to make your
attention superfluous.
Get off, Meegeren,
you fake!
Your shoes are ???
I can always take my shoes off.
If that was calculated
to be cruel...
you, certainly, don't know
how to make an appeal.
Even, on the poorest level!
Now leave... and take
Vermeer with you!
Your Catherina Bolnes
is waiting for you.
Barren or not!
I've got... got this new story for
you about the origin of the species.
You know one...
What walks on four
legs in the morning,
two legs in midday and...
three legs in the afternoon?
Do you think Alba would like it?
It's yours for £25.
We want you to make us a suit.
I know! Plenty of
measuring inside leg?
God, Milo! You got
a one track mind!
By that you mean you've
got two... one each!
We want you...
to make us a suit.
There are plenty of
respectable tailors.
A three-piece suit.
Who's the third part for?
All three parts are for us, Milo.
But are you capable of
handling the inside arms?
All right!
I'll strike a bargain with you.
You get me a story published...
and I'll make the underwears
that go with the suit.
Zebras die here with
unfailing regularity.
Why is that?
It's about the only black and
white animal left in the zoo.
- What about the panda?
- It's stuffed.
- It isn't!
- It is! Ask Plate!
It moves in a ???
on the bamboo sheets.
How often do you see it move?
- It was always asleep.
- Totally asleep.
Plate makes dump
pellets out of plasticine,
scatters them above
the cage each afternoon.
- He doesn't!
- He does!
The only trouble is he
gets the colour wrong.
Very different color every day...
But don't worry! The kids
know exactly what is going on.
I bet if you ask Beta
she'd tell you.
What a fake!
How could they
get away with it?
They've been get away
with this all the time.
Haven't you noticed?
Catherina Bolnes is
never the same twice.
You can only recognize
her by that dreadful hat.
I'm not so certain whether Van
Hoyten is always the same person.
The clothes are the same.
You always suppose
to recognize him.
You can never fail
to recognize a zebra.
Or an angel!
Hello!
I thought you said he had legs.
He's taken them off...
to meet you on an equal footing.
Felipe... Arc-en-Ciel!
Hello!
I'm a whore for freaks!
Separated Siamese
twins... my speciality!
I have been told, madam,
of your ???
I sympathize!
I, madam...
I'm an inordinate
admirer of horses.
Pregnant mares, especially!
I've always wished that I could've
served a white pregnant mare.
And have you tried?
In this present maimed company
I can admit to anything.
A white mare was
my downfall...
literary!
I was ??? and kicked...
but I still last after riding her.
Her name was Hortensia.
I'm jealous already!
Doesn't a horse has four legs?
Then that, madam, is just
enough for both of us.
And this, Milo, is for you!
For bringing us together.
Come on, Oliver!
You've done enough.
Enough?
This tiger walks 10 miles up
and down this cage every day.
Do you really think it will walk
fewer miles with you inside him?
In a striped, flannel suit with
a grease in your trousers?
Maybe I should take
a few clothes off!
Make it easier!
You suppose to let the animals
out, not go in there with them.
How can I let out the tiger?
They'd only shoot it.
Oliver, if you don't come
out we'll shoot it anyway.
Enough room for this bloody
change... or a strip-tease.
Enough of room there
to what you've got.
Look, I think better join you.
Oswald! One fool
in there is enough!
Stop him!
What in earth are
they trying to prove?
The tiger was, obviously,
making a prophetic gesture.
I can't consider the possibilities
of joining you together but...
between us… could
we satisfy the experts?
??? to satisfy
the experts before.
Meaning?
By providing the zoo with
the one-legged gorilla.
Do you feel that the
gorilla is here abused?
If you feel that my
care is incomplete,
I must look at
the animal again.
What for?
To amputate its other leg?
If it's painful, cut it off!
Is that your answer?
Animals on the whole are designed
with a view of... symmetry.
Surely, in your experiments
you must have seen it.
One of decay's first
characteristics is to
spoil that symmetry,
wouldn't you say?
You leave that animal
alone, Meegeren!
Dear ???! What do
you think I am?
You're certainly not Vermeer.
Was it really necessary to amputate
a second time on Alba Bewick?
Yes it was!
And if you doubt my abilities,
I wonder why you're here!
Why do you want it done?
Completeness!
I will do it for nothing, though
I understand that you're rich.
That's just not true!
But don't tell me.
How?
For a start...
let me be the father
of her child.
- No!
- No!
I could help you,
maybe, even more.
I noticed, Oswald,
all your experimental
subjects have been female.
Do you envisage taking your...
photographic experiment
to completion?
See, Milo is a
good friend of mine.
She weights 126 pounds.
She's 5'6" ???
One inch shorter than
your wife, I believe.
Like your wife... she's
now 10 weeks  pregnant.
Child is mine.
She may very well
have an abortion.
I can ???.
There could be complications...
and I can ???
You see how much I am
prepared to bargain for.
Stand together!
You see, it could
be made to work.
I could stitch you together...
for a price.
Evolution as you know it Oswald,
undoubtedly, and for the
moment ends with man.
- Some say woman.
- And an apple.
How do you anticipate
completing you inquiries?
How much would you pay, do
you think, for a human corpse?
God, Hoyten! I really
believe you mean it!
Milo is about your wife's
build... and age and wit.
And she is pregnant
with my child.
What's so amusing?
Venus de Milo is unusually
fertile... or rather careless...
For someone without arms.
A little persuasion and I know that
Milo is ready to visit the zebras.
Now zebras are notoriously fickle...
very possessive of their mares.
Especially ??? zebra.
You know! The one with the
soft eyes and the sharp ???
- and the vicious ???
- And the big prick!
You deceive yourself, Hoyten.
Just the thought you alone,
I'd make sure Milo never died.
Here's your £400
for one female zebra.
Killed, no doubt,
in a corner.
But for the same 400... you
must put in... a tranquilliser gun.
I'm not! You're not thinking of
doing your own killing, are you?
I strongly advise against it.
- Do you have a flat piece of plastic?
- No!
- Do you have a sharpened pencil?
- No!
You are well equipped...
Why're you doing this for us?
Isn't it obvious?
Venus... locks me into the
hearts of men... and monkeys.
What makes you two think you can
behave such cavalierly on this zoo?
We have saved this gorilla
from further mutilation.
By killing it?
Thanks to you, it was ???
Has been for the last three years.
Is that for you to decide?
This zoo is ran by an
incompetent ???.
I wonder why they've
stayed here so long?
You need to stay no longer.
You are fired!
On what excuse?
Maltreatment of
animals, the one.
Misuse of zoo property,
for another.
Unauthorized
freeing of animals...
- We haven't finished.
- Finish what?
Some bogus experiment that
satisfies your obsession of grief?
What valuable conclusion can be
gained from all this rotten meat?
Nothing!
How can you
measure decay?
By degrees of grief, perhaps...
Or by planning a zoo devoted
to black and white animals
because you're colour-blind...
They can assure there's
no opposition by killing off
some of the black and white
animals that aren't yours...
For the using a zoo for some exotic
gaming of barter and blackmail...
Or by maiming animals so that
they can be expensively patched up!
God grief, Alba!
You kept that quiet?
How did you
manage one each?
I thought I had failed.
After all they are not Siamese!
Careful!
- So where've you been?
- We were busy.
How did you do it?
I just sat on the eggs!
How do you mean
you were busy?
We got to call them.
- Castor and Polydeuces?
- From the ??? of the swan.
Too obvious!
- Gamma and Delta.
- Wrong sex.
Do Greek letters have a sex?
What's the excuse
for the bruises?
It's not important.
- Did you know?
- Must've known?
No! I can't safely say I didn't...
but I should have guessed.
And what's not important?
We've been fired...
sacked, dismissed, ???
From the zoo?
What was the last drop?
Did you photograph a
camel with a broken back?
How are you?
Tired and my feet ache.
So does my back.
- We're sorry we weren't here.
- So am I!
Are you pleased?
Of course!
Now give them back.
- What are you going to do now?
- Continue!
Where and with what?
We thought you wouldn't mind
us working at L'Escargot.
What do you doing?
Making a zoo.
- Can I look?
- Only if you pay.
The old story!
But with a brand new taxonomy.
Only an innocent would
put a spider and a fly
in the same cage because
they were both brown.
Well, putting them together
will probably tell an innocent
more of our spiders and flies,
than keeping them apart.
- And you mustn't cheat.
- Cheat?
I must mark the back of your hand
with ink to make sure you've paid.
What ??? for?
Now you look so alike, I can't tell the
difference between you any more.
We have L'Escargot ready.
When will you be
allowed to come?
I'm well enough,
but I'm not coming.
Why ???
I'm ill. Van Meegeren
says, my spine is damaged.
Oh, why listen to him?
Haven't had enough of him?
I'm not coming.
I want to stay here... near
the hospital... near the zoo.
But I'm well enough
to tell you something...
that I know you
are not going to like.
I do not want you to be the
legal father of my children.
You what?
Van Meegeren has
squeezed that out of you.
Non, pas du tout!
We are the father!
You see?
A bad grammar doesn't
signify anything.
Went in ??? and
they came out ???.
It stopped raining.
I found my Arc-in-Ciel.
I cannot have my children
having three parents.
What difference does that make?
Listen!
You found Felipe for me...
you and Milo.
He's an ideal father.
Grief has made you unreliable.
On your own admission,
you are jobless.
- I cannot risk your extreme behaviour.
- You risked it before.
It's too much
responsibility for you...
and you would be prevented
from being together.
Nonsense!
Felipe will make a better father.
He's legless!
Did that stop me
being a mother?
Motherhood isn't voluntary!
We'll take legal action.
Oswald, stop being petulant!
What would you gain?
I'm sure that a married male twins
don't make a good legal precedent.
Beta now can't even tell
which of you is which.
In the court-room... I can't imagine
that you would win. And if you did...
you would know it was
against my wishes.
I think Adam was
a Siamese twin.
What happened to his brother?
Perhaps for some minds
the most difficult step
to comprehend
in the Theory of
Natural Selection
is the enormous leap
from the higher apes
to 20th century man.
All that way to
bring me to this...
Now I want you
to be here tonight...
and I mean it!
No pre-engagements.
Bring Beta's record
and you can watch me go.
Go? Where you going?
- I've had enough!
- What do you mean?
My children ???, aren't they?
Aren't they?
And I am exhausted.
The swan succeeded
in the end.
I'm busy tonight.
??? can't get tonight.
What are you doing
that's so important?
- I'm grieving!
- Still?
Always!
I'm now childless
as well as wifeless.
You've forgotten jobless
and homeless.
Let's strike a bargain.
Thanks for thirty seconds of
your sympathy. No bargains!
- No record!
- No record?
I'm not going to bargain
about a gramophone record.
You can stay away.
We will come,
on one condition.
Don't tell me, I know!
You want my corpse.
Mon Dieu! My body for a
gramophone record...
and a visit from a pair
of Siamese twins.
Haven't you had
enough of my body?
- You're our last chance!
- And you were my first choice.
Well! Thank you both!
And we need the use of the garden
of L'Escargot for nine months.
- A significant period.
- Or longer.
We figured we can ask this because
we've given up legal parenthood.
You've learned a thing or
two from the zoo, haven't you?
Even if it's only how to bargain.
All right!
In the interest of science...
some science...
you can have it,
if you can get it.
But I know you won't get it
because now I have a family.
And you know
what families are for.
With your permission in
writing how can they stop us?
Oh! Easily!
They could write the words...
insanity... Oh! Insanitary!
??? long been respectable to leave
your body to medical science.
What's scientific about
watching a body rot?
You always said, you wanted to
go back to L'Escargot, so be it.
You'll lie quietly in the garden.
- With you watching?
- Only the camera will be watching.
What's the point
of watching me?
My body is only half here.
Then you'll fit better
into the film frame.
A fine epitaph...
"Here lies a body cut
down to fit the picture."
...to share his intelligence.
And whatever the
system he has used
the ability to store and
pass on his knowledge...
is the key to his success.
"X" is for...
There aren't any animals
beginning with "X".
"Y" is for...
Yak! It's a sort of ox.
- And "Z" is for...
- Zebra!
Good evening, Milo!
It's a clear night.
It's not like you to
speculate on the weather.
That's the sort of night you've
been waiting for, perhaps.
Isn't it time you decided to do
what you've been wanted to do
ever since I've ???
- You got a flat piece of plastic?
- Yes!
- A sharpen pencil?
- Yes!
- You are well equipped.
- Yes, I am!
Hold this!
Well! Here we go!
What's the time?
One o' clock.
You won't be long.
I didn't mother 26
children of the alphabet.
You made an
encouraging last fling.
I am the last of L'Escargot.
From here on, it's yours...
along with my corpse.
Don't worry!
The papers are signed and sealed.
You are the last and
we are already finished.
A zed and two noughts!
What a zoo!
All right!
Don't do anything with
my body I wouldn't do.
Now I want to lie
still and quiet.
Put on Beta's record.
Dogs were born for howling.
Cats are always prowling.
Beef are always ???.
Nature makes them do it.
All the jungle ???
have habits of their own.
A worm will turn
in quite the nicest way...
Oh God!
She's gone!
And what are the signs?
No pulse.
No eye movement.
No breathing.
No heart-beat.
The skin pales
and becomes stiff.
Turn off that awful record!
Wait until is finished!
A horse, of course,
it's such a noble beast.
It never shops but works and
works and doesn't mind at least.
It shops an ox,
to treat it like your pet.
The beasts that live can all forgive
but an elephant never forgets.
Now what?
We take her to L'Escargot.
In a coffin?
For decency’s sake,
we take her in a coffin.
In a long or a short coffin?
I'm sure Alba would've been
amused by a short coffin.
At least it leaves no
room for artificial legs.
In a long or a short coffin?
I don't think that
it'll be for us to decide.
The family have arrived.
I'm sure they all
want a long coffin.
Now, I see that you're upset...
and you like animals.
So I gave you this
as a present.
I will not be taking Alba to
L'Escargot to film her decay.
If you go down in the woods today,
you're sure of a big surprise.
If you go down in the woods today,
you'd better go in disguise.
For every bear that ever there was
will gather there for certain because
today's the day the Teddy Bears
have their picnic.
Every Teddy Bear who's been good
is sure of a treat today.
There's lots of marvellous things to eat
and wonderful games to play.
Beneath the trees where nobody sees
They'll hide and seek as long as they please
That's the way the Teddy Bears
have their picnic.
Picnic time for Teddy Bears...
The little Teddy Bears are
having a lovely time today.
Watch them, catch them unawares,
and see them picnic on their holiday.
See them gaily gad about.
They love to play and shout.
They never have any care.
At six o'clock their
Mummies and Daddies
will take them home to bed,
'cause they're tired little Teddy Bears.
If you go down in the woods today,
you'd better not go alone.
It's lovely down in the woods today,
but safer to stay at home.
God! 
This floor is hard...
Today's the day the Teddy Bears
have their picnic.
