Ma'am!
Cigarette outside!
Come!
Sit!
So tell me ma'am!
You want to file a complain?
Against who you want to file a complain?
Have you fought with someone?
May I call lady constable?
Did somebody assaulted you?
Ma'am! If you won't speak then
I can't do anything

at least pick up your phone

we will understand?
Say something!
Get up!
She want to lodge the complain
we don't want to lodge any complain,
who are you?
I am her secretary!
Get up!
Why did you need to come in
police station?
Have you fought with aryan?
What is the your relationship with aryan?
What do we say about her?
We journalist doesn't feel good
without giving any labels
that's why we gave different names
Mahi was a star
but she was totally different
from other actresses
she gave nice interviews
you never find out what she will
say anything
she was little bit crazy
why she shouldn't be?
She was from the broken family
parent fighting everyday...
disturbed childhood
then what?
Mahi got the reason to become more wild
and she escaped to mumbai
you already know that how much film
industry likes complicated stories
so Mahi Arora becomes...
what's happening?
All well!
Cancel all the appointments today, why?
What happen Mahi!
Because I will take rest all day long
so I should look fab for success party
you always looks fab
by the way have you seen Gayatri
on premiere party
she was bitching about you
sitting with Riya
these actresses can't be for
another actress
when did I compete with them
and by the way picture is hit and
Aadi's line up is good
so who cares what anyone says...
I completely agreed
give me my cigarette packet
please try your outfits what
I have brought
what you have to wear in tonight's party
we will decide it right now,
I don't want to try
give me anything you want
and aryan is also coming
in tonight's party
did he ever came to your any function
like every time he won't come
he might come in tonight's party
I've heard that you will become
indian cricket team
look! It's a film party
so if you will
leave cricket discussion on pitch
so that will be better
your and Mahi's rivalry is so
famous these days
we have no rivalry
and I am really happy that Sameer
and Mahi's movie is hit
that's why I came in party
I came to give my wishes to Sameer
I've heard that you are writing
your biography
why do I need to write my biography?
There are many ex-editors of
magazine and newspapers
somebody will write that
I have told after preview that your
picture is super hit
your new movie custody is released
people are talking about your performance
I was so busy I didn't get time to watch
I will fix the show for you soon
they are meeting like sisters
recently that movie mumbai love
was released
she had a great debut in that movie
that's great
she is also doing two south movies
he didn't come!
I have told you he won't come
let's do it after the break
I don't watch his movies so how
could I came to his party
party was also about my success
and you have said that you will come
you asked me so I couldn't refuse
you have done the same to
didn't attend the party
rats also said that you won't come
why you took her so seriously?
Because you don't take me seriously
if you would...
so I could see that
tonight I came to your home
I have already send my passport
to your office
because it will take 15 days for
bahamas visa
there are three months left to go bahamas
this holiday is very important for me
we have never been for holidays together
where is that?
Coming in 20 minutes
Akshay is not feeling well
what happen to my Spiderman?
Since when he is sick?
He was feeling weak when
he left from the school
I have called the doctor
sleep down!
Akshay was insisting that's why
I had to call you
you are coming from your own house
or from Mahi's house
why you are asking?
By the way my lawyer called up
divorce papers are ready for sign
so do it!
I will
but I wanted to ask you first
what did you decide about Ben Sten house?
Why to think about that?
I have already told you that I will
keep that flat
I have already give you this house and
two houses in goa
but I am not asking for myself
I am asking for your son
his school is near from Bandra
you know that I have bought that
flat for my parents
but you can shift your parents in
Malahar flat
3 properties and 10 crores settlement
and you are still hungry
I never thought that...
I also didn't thought...
but decide about the flat so
we could sign the papers
I was certain that it will be done
there is no chance?
What happen?
Do you know the owner of Panash?
Yeah!
What about him?
Their endorsement contract is on renewal
and my team is trying from 2 years
but this time they are continuing
with Mahi
it's not fine!
If I will get this endorsement
that Jai Sanwi!
He is a bisexual
I know...
we should open zip and tongue
very carefully
Riya Mehra got the endorsement of
Binaysh travels
I can't do every endorsement
you are taking everything very lightly
coming in twenty minutes!
I've heard that your movie is hit
when the next release is?
I don't know...
it will be publish in newspapers, read it!
I have recommended your name
for Padmashree
within one month you came to Dehli
three times
and you didn't came home once
because if I will stay here then I'll
have to meet minister Khurana
and what about your special co-star?
Last time you came here so you said
that he'll get divorce in 6 months
it's been eight months
did you spoke to him?
He is going to marry you or not?
Stop it!
So many questions?
Did I ever ask you about
your relationships
because you are not my mom
I know that you are insecure with
this relationship
and one day this insecurity will
turn into obsession
I don't want that in future nor you
have relationship nor career
you are talking about yourself
not mine
I am totally different from you
but remember!
You have said the same thing
in last two relationships
dubbing will be done tonight!
We have two events next week
you have come to take interview
of my director
since you have joined "mumbai delhi"
you don't call me
it's not like that
I was busy that's all!
Busy!
With Riya Mehra!
You have put her on cover page twice
and she does a lot for you
free vacations for your family,
new laptop for you
dubai shopping trips
in fact I know her before becoming a star
that's why you print all negative
stories about me what she gave you
you are the associate editor
of mumbai Dehli
film star's friendships are not with you
but with your position
I am having dinner with your group editor
we will must talk about you
where are you?
You supposed to come here
pack up for today!
Today is the last day
tell them that I got food poison
tell the boss that I am in van
you left your shooting and
came to my shooting
without informing me, you are spying on me
why?
I can't come
this love scene wasn't in script
film is about to release in one month
so suddenly where this scene came from?
Director thought that this scene is
important for second half so he added
really?
So why you didn't tell me?
What do you mean?
Since when we discussed our scenes?
Why we can't discuss?
We are getting married
real problem is that...
that you don't want to commit
so you always have your macho
playboy image
and you can add these scenes with your
heroines whenever you want
I am taking divorce with Eesha and
what else you want
you are not taking divorce because of me
I am with you since one year
and you have filed your divorce
one and half year ago...
it's very dangerous to perform
these stunts
I will also become a hero like my papa
I will do superman movies
how many times I told you don't
talk to strangers
you started playing with anyone
let's go!
Aryan is with you
he is giving divorce to Eesha
so if he won't show her anger to
you then what else she will do
aryan should have control her
he didn't said anything to her
but how he would say something,
he was in the middle of short
whatever this Eesha does?
Aryan is serious about you
what else you want?
If he is really serious about you
then why did he stop you to
come in Rohan's party
he didn't said that don't come in party
he just said come in the party
when Eesha will be gone
Rohan is also your good co-star
and he invited you as well
why you can't be there?
Of course! She can go,
but a little later
it's our anniversary and you are
thoughing party in your house
that was zara's idea
these actresses are amazing
she is getting close to the wife
because she is expecting movie with Rohan
she is a fraud
who is not a fraud in this
glamour industry
and by the way sheena was also an actress
she will make sure that she don't
get any movie
what's the report?
Sameer khan is recommending her
she is a good actress but...
I have heard she doesn't meet anyone
after pack up
you have great knowledge about her
before this romeo got that juliet
I will have to make one movie with her
it's your first anniversary
otherwise you will need my divorce lawyer
come on!
After all you are my sister
it's not so easy to spend a year
with Rohan
what a surprise?
Why?
You thought I won't come
I have told you don't come here
please leave!
Why?
Rohan is also my friend
I am also invited
please don't be dramatic
and go from here
what's the problem?
Everybody knows about us here
why do you hide?
It's not the right place to
discuss all these things
don't be afraid
no matter what you treat me badly
I will never embarrass you
give me a vodka!
You are leaving!
At least finish your drink
it's finished
I am not going anywhere
you just think about your image
did you ever think what everyone
speak about me
and by the way I was leaving that place
why did she need to talk to me?
At least finish your drink!
She provoked me
you never said anything to her
so I said it!
Whenever I am talking about our self
you always speak nothing...
I was taking much pressure before
yesterday's sixer
then what you have done?
Whenever I couldn't concentrate
so I sing a song
bowler gone to his runner up
and I started singing
I was singing
my entire team will be thankful to
you my century
and me too
thankful!
Amazing!
Exactly come out from the restaurant
in ten minutes
what happen?
Shall we?
Sure!
How are you?
How are you Mahi?
I am fine
I am shooting on next floor,
I am also shooting on this floor
so why are you sitting here?
Sit in your van,
I think they don't have it
and it's just three days work
so they didn't gave me, they didn't?
You are from production?
Yes!
Where is her van?
Forget it!
What should I tell you?
This producer's wife is having
account for everything
so how do I bring van for character artist
you tell me!
You come with me, I'll manage!
When her shot will be ready
then call her from my van
why you become so upset?
I am addicted of these things
we didn't had vans in our time
where we were
we sat under umbrella
and we started shooting
you must had problems in those days
without privacy
I don't know...
entire film unit sit and stood together
directors, hero, heroines,
everybody worked happily
that's why
I never felt problem
that's why
we gave much values to relationships
fame and success
but we become actresses for
fame and success
yes!
We do...
but fame snatch a lot from us as
much it gave us
we don't see anything in glamour
that how much we have lost?
And when we find out
then it's too late,
everything is going on perfect timeline
in four month we got 7 airline endorsements
11 high profile events
and you are on all cover pages
that's alright but you are a heroine
you should sign a film
a heroine got adds and endorsements
from her movies
and it's high time that you sign
a huge movie
he is making a south remake
entire movie will be shoot abroad
if you will get this movie
but I have heard that he is
considering Riya Mehra
and Gayatri is desperately trying
for this movie
so what are my chances?
We will find out when you will try
rather you defeat Riya and Gayatri
in this race
rather sitting here and get defeated
I am on shoot, I will talk to you later
tell him to talk with Rasheed Bhai
and finalize it in 20
you will charge money to your mom
for a social cause
it's ruling party they have a lot of money
I am taking 20 cause of you
I have promised to Pratab
she is celebrating her 25th birthday
from last 5 years
people said like that for every heroine
you don't know about her
I know her when she was a model
for 2000 per day
she knows how to reach on time
and she will do anything for that
anything!
Minimum 31!
She is 31 years
she has changed her age in birth
certificate and passport
I know everything
that bad boys movie was released.
She got her passport before that movie
I am not interested in her gossip
what I forgot?
What happen?
Work stress!
If I won't anything soon then my
career will be down
you have offers for many films
you are doing adds
media is writing about us
I have many film offers
but nothing interesting
and nothing happens with adds
and magazines
I would never said it
but I am comfortable with you
that's why I am saying
please talk to zara for me
Abbas is doing Nikhil Anand's movie
if zara will speak to him
then he won't refuse her
but Mahi!
I have never spoke to zara about
Abbas profession
but I believe that I am perfect
for that role
and he also signed Gayatri
and you know how Gayatri is...
I don't want to force you
more over what will happen
my career will be over
but I will buy an ipl team with
some businessman
what else?
You know Abbas and I know that Gayatri
you know what's going to happen on outdoor
same christina matter
you want to stay in mom's house again
but they all are same
whom we can trust?
And he will have to take someone in film
we have one safe option Mahi!
Abbas knows that she with me so he
will be carefull
Mahi is not such a noble person
I have heard a lot about her
and I have seen her...
now she is with me
and you know how serious I am about her
otherwise I wouldn't came here
you don't like anyone else
except actresses
I can't see beauty anywhere else
please talk to abbas about her
for me!
Your phone!
Angat called up!
I have a breaking news
now I am the heroine of abbas khan
in Nikhil Anand's movie
this Nikhil is a slave driver
he is taking work from us from seven days
it's outdoor shooting and he didn't
gave a break for single day
anyway I am getting pack up early
you like red wine
in fact one of my fan gifted me
50 years old wine bottle
the matter is...
I am on antibiotics
so I can't drink wine
how long?
Three days
today is Tuesday
let's drink on friday
I will tell Nikhil that...
how was that?
This was Mahi's idea
Mahi is most favourite heroine in
your all heroines
from today Mahi is also my
most favourite heroine
abbas your idea of item number with
Gayatri was fabulous
I know...
make the first trailor of this song
in fact focus your publicity on
this item number
make a solo poster of Gayatri
solo poster!
But...
Mahi is the heroine
I am handling the entire movie
you handle Mahi
we will have the weekend of 50 crores
I have prediction on trade
I can give you in written it will make
the business of 150 crores
nobody can stop it,
you were recommending Mahi in our movie
she have 8 scenes in movie and she
couldn't do that properly
we need actress
you have done that song besides
your busy schedule
what happen?
It's not fair...
I am not in movie
you know abbas
after movie shooting he controls from
editing to publicity design
he didn't let me sit in editing
look at the public reaction
trade pandits are saying that this
movie will make 150 crores
now whoever is hit in this industry
announce the sequel
mind blowing!
That will hit 100 crores
Mahi looks upset!
Her role has been cut
what will happen to being upset
she messed up with abbas
if she will upset the heroes
then she will be on stamp size on posters
not a single review praised me
every critics said that abbas is a star
and Mahi is a show piece
you have already got three calls
for endorsements
you had offers of two big movies
am I a good actress?
Am I a good actress?
You are a star!
You don't need to be an actress
yes!
I need it
such a filmstar
why you want to do my film?
You know that I am a century film maker
my movie is about prostitution
it has sex, abuses...
I make realistic movies
and you are the commercial heroine
my movie budget is low
and big heroines like you have
big attitudes
I promise it won't happen
this is my first hindi movie
we will have problem with your
dates and price
I make start to finish movie
you couldn't do another work
till six months
dates will be yours, price will be yours.
You are such a good actress
that pain inside you
just bring it on screen and nobody
will touch you
how many boyfriends you have?
You must have counted
I have 17
I don't need answer
I have just told that man
fuck me here if you want
I am not coming in any hotel
great!
It was nothing
now listen!
A whore had four lovers
one was inside
one was outside
third lover was sick
and fourth was ready
get off from here
you are stealing Tarannum's money
listen to me!
Whatever happened that day...
anyway!
That special appearance
that's finished today
I am going back to calcutta
it was really nice working with you
I am sorry that we couldn't be friends...
take care!
We had a nice weekend
I don't know why did I came airport
to drop you
nothing will happen to irritate
you know that I am telling the truth
and you know it's not easy to take
these decisions
but why it's not so easy?
You always said that aryan is not
ready to give you commitment
and now angat wants to marry you
then what's the problem?
Don't you love him?
Of course I love him
but right now I want to concentrate
on my career
and he also have a career
so what's the hurry for marriage?
It's your decision to get married
or not with angat
but I am clearly telling you one thing
what's inside in your heart,
just tell him clearly
what aryan has done with you don't
do that with him
everyone told me that you won't
marry with me
I didn't refuse for marriage
I just said that right now we need to
give time to our careers
so what's the hurry of wedding?
You have ruined my entire year to said it
how much more time you need?
It's all your excuses
when you heroines got love so you
need career
and when you got career so you need love
and your career is not gonna over
to get marry with me
I was a fool
I thought you are different from everyone
there is nothing in this film industry
I wanted to take you along
but enough!
You actresses can't do the real love
only you can act for love
please! Relax!
You can only use the people
you can't do it
how could you stop this movie
I can do everything
he is teaching film making to
national award winning film director
sometimes he said that film
is very serious
sometimes he said put some
comedy track in the film
sometimes he said put an item
song in the film
now he is teaching me film making
I will talk to him
everything will be sort out, no!
Nothing will sort out!
I have decided that I won't do this film
how could you leave this film?
I haven't got another work for this movie
no films, no endorsements.
And you will drop this movie in the middle
I know that you worked hard for this movie
this experience you got in this film
then you will miss me
stop it!
I don't want to go anywhere...
you have to be a good friend to make
a true friend
and filmstars couldn't think about
anyone else
if Mahi would have her own that
she won't be afraid from inside
she wouldn't made so many mistakes
and Mahi is giving it a punishment
to her own self
old rivals and new girls took her place
finally there was only Shagufta Rizvi
where Mahi felt better to meet her
when she met her in those days
I have written that Mahi is responsible
of her own condition
but either it's your or someone
else mistake
you feel the same pain
she have done everything to
get rid of that pain
so what did you decide?
I have heard that you are taking
psychiatric treatment
and you have mentioned in form
that you are alcohol addicted
your family background and
professional life
after scrutinise both our panel
has decided
that you are not able to become
single parent
I am not able...
how did they decide?
Did they ever seen me?
Did they ever met me?
After giving these papers how did
you decide that I am not able?
You need patience and emotional
control to become a good parent
and you don't have both qualities
practice for more few years
apply again
you can't do it
I am not able to become a mom
what is this?
You should be happy
so what if you couldn't have adaption?
After all you are front page news
nowadays you will have to pay for
these coverage
how did you gave this story without
my permission
now I will need have to ask
for your permission
you forgot that time
so you didn't had any objection
because it's my personal life
in our industry there is no difference
between personal and professional life
your life is a public property
whom I have used and plan for
your comeback
what you have totally ruined
these are my P. R skills that you are
still in news
so you got publicity and you should
become little bit interesting
otherwise what else you have?
Get out right now!
You couldn't hear the truth
someone said the right!
There are humans...
Mahi gave you two super hit movies
one with mr. Rohan...
she have right to do another
movie with you
you know very well
industry's equation is depend on
friday to friday
and Mahi's last hit film was abbas film
and that was one year ago
and her problems with heroes
not another hero would like
to work with her
her madness,
which prostitute movie she had done
she has wasted nine months
and in these nine months so many
fresh faces have arrived
and industry doesn't wait for anyone
nor Mahi is professional
neither she have box office success
listen to my advice
tell Mahi that get any reality show
or marry with rich n.I. R...
this movie has investment of 150 crores
we can't make it more risky to
take Mahi in this movie
what did you said?
But our company is new,
this is our launcher movie
everything should be new...
and audience have already seen
you and Mahi
and audience like us a lot, people like you
you also know that audience always
need fresh pairing
and I have spoke to distributor
they are excited if we take Shaheen khan
she gave two super hit movies
you have already spoke to her
I have just spoken to her secretary
look! I have promised this movie
with Mahi
that's why you are become very emotional
I was suggest that keep separate your
professional and personal life
besides I am not refusing you that
don't work with Mahi
we will adjust her in next movie
but she is not good for his movie
as per budget
so less media is here
what we will talk?
What we do?
There are two big events today
I think everybody is gone there
they have promised that they will come
you should have change the conference date
what's the meaning of
incomplete conference
I have heard that you and aryan
are getting married
so it means that you are going
to be retired
we have come to speak about this movie
I don't want to answer any
personal questions
I have request to you
that just ask me professional questions
you are right!
So we came here for any
professional discussions
so please answer the professional question
rumours are that you have been
signed for aryan's home production
but now Shaheen khan has replaced you
this decision has been taken because
of your law market position
your response!
You media person should write film scripts
to take out your personal enmity
you make stories
if heroine got the car
so businessman gifted her
she bought a diamond so she got engagement
if she is gone to hospital for check up
so she got abortion
if she is gone to L.A. so she
got plastic surgery
and god forbid if she is gone to dubai
so you made her rate card
people should learn from you
to make stories
you are getting disgrace
you are still not answering the answer
you know that you have been out
from aryan's home production
this rumour is wrong
I am the heroine of aryan's movie
have you got your answer?
And do you have any question
regarding this movie?
Do you have any question?
I guess not!
I am trying since long,
why you're not picking up the phone?
I was in press conference
I wanted to talk about that
there is a buzz in entire media that
Shaheen is replacing you
that Tamanna has asked me, story is right
you know I just spoke to
Shaheen's secretary
even dates are also discussed
and Shaheen is doing aryan's movie,
not you!
I have to talk to you
did you speak with alex?
I have told you that I didn't
speak with alex
so I am still in the movie
I have spoken to alex
but we didn't take any decision,
he wanted that we should sign Shaheen
and after hearing Shaheen's name
you have gone insane
you couldn't say that I am in this movie
this movie is still yours
just let me talk to alex
everything will be fine
you have said it on Eesha's time
I shouldn't trust you
it's not a big deal like you are making
so why don't you say...
that I am the heroine of this movie
because I will have to speak with alex
we will have to take many decisions,
I am still saying I will sort
out everything
today I am not a heroine of a big movie
that's why you are doing it all
then tell me
tell me that I am the heroine of
this movie
I am the heroine of this movie
for me yes
what an answer?
You can't be loyal to anyone
you know the media
discuss anything and media make it news
nobody else knows this thing
I will make this movie only with Mahi
why you are become so emotional with Mahi
it's not an emotional decision
read the script!
If this movie will be made so it will
be made with Mahi
what happen?
Your Dehli ticket!
You will have to leave from here,
you are getting late
cancel it!
How could we cancel?
People are waiting there
I will show him!
Yes!
Where are you?
I am at home
come at my house
I will tell you at home
how do I come at this time?
Come at my house
he got Shaheen in that movie
I can't do anything...
film got the bumper opening
multiplex and single screens are rocking
you also thinks that this is wrong
who cares?
Film got the bumper opening
95./. In multiplexes and single screens
if it's the matter of right and wrong
I don't know...
I just know that from which Mahi
I met 10 years ago
that Mahi...
should ask this question before
it's all done
not later...
here's the dates diary
you don't need me anymore
media is waiting outside
you will have to say something
did Mahi's movie succeed?
After such a big scandal movie
must have to succeed
then what else we have to speak
she couldn't talk
but I will must give her your message
she is getting so many offers that
Mahi is going to be busy for 2 years
did you see?
That's our industry!
Did you decide which dress you
will wear in success party
people won't remember it all
people will forget this controversy
in few days
you should also forget that...
entire media was looking for Mahi
and she came in Shagufta's funeral
tell everyone to send their teams
please tell us!
What's the secret of sex scam?
Are you Mahi Arora?
And this answer has solved
Mahi's complicated life
which happiness she was looking in the sky
she found that happiness to become
a part of crowd...
