I swear to God, I had nothing to do with this.
We would love to believe you, Mr.
Stevens, but you have
to admit, your version of events does
sound pretty bizarre, don't you think?
Look, it was a setup, OK? The
whole thing was staged.
So you were afraid? That's your claim.
You were the victim?
Well, I mean, you know, not... not like...
Not like who? Not like her?
Please, just talk to the others guys.
Have you talked to the others there?
We're doing our jobs.
So, why don't you just do
yourself a favor and confess?
You know, save some time, save
some legal fees. Come on.
Why don't you take us through
the events of this morning?
- Again?
- Again, Mr. Stevens.
Where were you this morning, Mr. Stevens?
I was at home. Alone. My
wife's taking the kids skiing.
Yeah, sure, your wife's on
her way back, as we speak.
And apparently, she has, uh, quite
a few questions, of her own.
So, the phone woke you around
what time this morning?
I don't know, uh, 9-9:30. It-it was Luke
in a panic. He said I had to come.
- Where were you supposed to go?
- To the loft. He told me to come to the loft.
Did he say why he was panicking?
- No.
- Well, did you know why he was panicking?
No, not yet.
Luke.
Luke?
Oh, my God!
Oh, fuck!!
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you just... were you...
I walked, in she was... lying there...
Oh, fuck!
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on their way.
- I-I still haven't reached Philip.
- OK, well, uh...
- keep calling, we need everybody here.
- Do you know who she is?
- Vincent, do you know who's lying there?
- What? No, of-of course not.
Well, how the fuck did they get in?
What was it, a w-window, a door?
Windows are sealed and the door was locked.
The alarm was turned off.
That's impossible.
I'm telling you, the door was
locked and the alarm was turned off.
- But that'd mean that...
- That someone got in... with one of our keys.
Do you know the loft building at the corner
of Second and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?
No.
You know, the new residential
one, down by the sports arena?
Designed, I believe, by your
good friend, Vincent Stevens.
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.
There's a loft on the ninth floor, Mr.
Seacord. Have you ever been there?
No.
Strange, because according to our information,
you and four friends are sharing this loft
secretly, without your wives' knowledge.
- That is ridiculous.
- Don't the five of you bring women up there?
Girlfriends, mistresses, one
night stands, catch of the day?
Five pals, just looking for privacy and fun,
without the hassle of Visa statements
and hotel bills, the Mrs. might find.
That is preposterous.
Maybe, Mr. Seacord, but one of your
friends already made a full confession.
- You wanna know who?
- Listen...
I don't do things like that, you know,
fool around with other women, I...
- You love your wife.
- I love my wife, yes.
What happened to your face, Mr. Seacord?
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?
Out with Chris, having breakfast. There'd be a
lot of people at the restaurant to verify that.
By Chris, you mean Dr. Chris
Vanowen, the psychiatrist?
That's right.
One of your loft buddies?
Chris is married. He's got two kids and, uh...
he's not a guy that cheats on his wife, either.
I got a serious fucking problem, Chris.
Oh, shit!
- Philip.
- Philip?
What, you think your brother
has something to do this?
No.
We gotta call the cops.
You realize what'll happen, if we call the cops?
Think about our wives.
It's a dead woman here, Vincent.
Why do we think Phillip is involved?
- Look, Chris, you know what he's capable of.
- Yeah, I know.
Maybe we can help him, OK? If we can just figure
out what the fuck happened, then maybe we can...
Then what, we gonna dump the body somewhere?
Look, I don't fucking know, but
I'm not taking the fall for this.
- Marty...
- Son of a bitch!
Have you seen Phil? Do you know where he is?
Was he here last night?
This can't be real.
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I wanna see her.
Put her back.
- Goddammit.
- Who is she?
I don't know.
Look. None of us has anything
to do with this, right? Right?
We're gonna find out what happened
here and we'll figure a way out.
We're in this together, we'll get out of
it together, OK? Because we're friends.
Agreed? Agreed?
Well, looks like they'll let anybody in, right?.
Congratulations, Vince. This one's
really spectacular. Very special.
I appreciate that.
- Allie, its been too long. You look terrific.
- Thank you.
So, uh... what do you think?
Well, it's bold and focused, as always. I like it.
- Hey, you made it. Hi.
- Hi.
Hi! How-how are you?
Wanna buy youselves a little condo?
I think Vincent's little condos
are a little out of our league.
Right, you and your puny psychiatrist salary.
Hey, you guys. Grab a drink, and we'll
catch up with you later, alright?
- Alright, OK. Congrats, buddy.
- Thanks, man.
- One hour, tops, then we're out of here.
- Oh, come on, hon. We just got here.
Man, check out all these babes, so hot! It's like
they're in violation of the fucking fire code.
 Marty, calm down. I've seen them.
I can also see Mimi... your wife.
OK, save me... help me... protect me.
What's up, chubbs? Havin' too much fun?
Nope, Just, uh, checkin' out the
hipster crowd with my pal, Luke.
Mmm-hmm! Yeah, if you embarrass me,
you may be here all by yourself.
Oh, don't raise my hopes only to dash them.
- Hi, Luke. Where's Allie?
- Uh, she's just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check her blood sugar.
Hi, Allie. You feel OK?
Oh, I, um... started to feel
not so great, before, but...
- I'm better now.
- We can always go home, sweetie.
Did you hear that, sweetie? After she just checked
her blood sugar. That's funny. That's really good.
I would love to see you deal with
something like that, if it was me.
Oh, you know, baby, I'd love to
stick you in the ass, every day.
- How many times have I asked?
- Honey.
- What?
- Not now.
- You're the shrink, aren't you?
- Uh, yeah, that's right. Chris Vanowen.
Ah! Dr. Vanowen! That's right. Yes, I remember.
- Do we know each other?
- Uh, no...
uh, you knew my sister. She was a-a patient
of yours, actually. Sofie? Sofie Morris?
No. I'm sorry. I'm-I'm really sorry.
Some people are just... born unhappy.
I'm sorry, are you buying an apartment?
What? Umm, no... no-no, I'm
friends with the architect.
- Oh!
- Are you?
No, no, I'm here with, uh, Joel Kotkin.
The city Councilman.
I work for him. A sort of,
uh, personal assistant.
Oh.
- I-I'm Anne. Anne Morris.
- Very nice to meet you, Anne.
- And listen, about your sister...
- It's OK.
You couldn't have saved her. Her mood disorder
kinda runs in the family... unfortunately, so...
Well, you're not thinking of doing
something stupid, are you, Anne?
Me? Uh, you mean like falling...
for the wrong man? Well,
I do that all the time.
Everything's alright. Come on. Keep partying.
What are you doing?
- Phil, I shoulda I guessed.
- Hey, Vince, what's up?
How are you? Thanks for coming.
Hey, I'm sorry about this,
she slipped, man, alright?
- No worries. As long as you're OK. You alright?
- She's fine. Come on.
Uh, let me introduce you to, um, a
colleague, who works with me, at the office...
and, uh, this one... works
with me, down at the office.
- Or is it other way around?
- Philip.
Ooh! My big brother! How you doing man?
- Friends of Vicky's? Bridesmaids?
- Aw, come on, man. I'm s-selling, you know?
- What are you doing?
- What?
It's not like I don't love my little Vicky, man.
I love her madly! You know that. Alright?
It's not like I hate all the
other women in the world, man.
Right. Alright, alright, relax.
There's something I wanna show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.
Chris?
- Gentlemen! Welcome to the loft.
- Wow, this is impressive, Vince!
Check out the view. Then, imagine that this is our
own private oasis, right in the heart downtown.
What do you mean?
A place where no one hassles you. A place
you can escape to, any time you want.
- OK, so, this your loft?
- No, it's ours... if you want it.
- What? Ours?
- Think about it.
No messy hotel bills, no...
questionable credit card activity.
This would be our secret place. To steal away,
discreetly and economically,
in these... challenging times.
Five way split. What do you think?
I don't know. I'm not like that.
Come on, Chris. We're men.
We're all a little like that.
Yeah, tell me about it. Give me your key
right now, bring your twins up here,
give 'em a little private tour.
You know what they cost, Marty?
How much? I might have it
on me, right now. Seriously.
Think about it. It's a great investment.
A once in a lifetime golden opportunity.
- I can't stay here.
- Where are you going? Luke?
You cannot freak out, right now. We
have to stay together, like we said.
Alright, alright. Luke, you
just calm the fuck down.
No, no! It's over, Vincent.
It's all gonna come out!
It's not over. Listen! We're gonna find out
what happened here and we gonna fix it. OK?
Try Phil again.
This is Philip. Please leave
a message after the tone.
What if he doesn't show? We need
to be out of the country by...
He'll show.
- You can't cover him, Chris. Not this time.
- Guys, look at this.
- What's it mean?
- What does it mean?
- Do you know Latin, Doctor?
- Excuse me?
Latin, do you know Latin?
- I took it pre-med, yeah.
- What's it say on the wall, there?
Fatum nos iungebit.
Fatum nos iungebit?
I can read that. What's it mean?
- I'm guessing you already know what it means.
- No, we would like to hear you say it.
You'd like to hear me say it? OK.
Fatum nos iungebit, uh...
Fate will unite us.
Now, all I can possibly think, is that
somebody, who knows Latin, like you...
reached over, with this young lady's hand,
and wrote Fatum nos iungebit on the wall.
- Fatum nos iungebit is wrong.
- How so, Doctor?
The future imperfect tense. The verb, unite,
iungere is not iungebit. It's iunget.
It should say fatum nos iunget. So, the person
you're looking for, made a classic Latin error.
I'm guessing you knew that already, too.
Didn't you?
Know the phrase, "Fuck You"? Germanic origin.
- Where's your brother?
- I'm sorry, I can't help you with that one.
Right. Well, actually, he's your half brother,
isn't he? Same mother, different fathers?
He spent some time in various
institutions, with your half-sister, Zoe.
Yeah, that's right.
After our mother died, um...
Philip wasn't... wasn't as lucky with his father.
- Apparently, not. Alcoholic child beater.
- Mmm.
You didn't spend much time
with Philip back then, did you?
No.
But now, you're best friends?
- Well, we've had a lot of catching up to do.
- You really don't know where we can find him?
Fate will unite us?
- Where the hell's your brother, Chris?
- I don't know.
What the hell is this?
- Where the fuck is Philip?
- I'm right here.
- Now, what the hell's going on?
- You did this.
- You DID THIS!
- Luke, Luke, Luke! Luke!!
- Come here, hey, hey!!!
- Hands off me! Bring it on!
- What is this?
- Luke!
Did you have anything to do with this?
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about!
Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?
Of course not! Jesus Christ!
Were you here last night?
No, man. I wasn't here last night.
I slept at my in-laws.
You don't believe me, call Vicky.
What about this morning.
Were you here this morning?
I was at a project site, alright?
With my father-in-law. My God!
- Where were you last night? Where've you been?
- Philip, take it easy.
Before accusing everyone else,
where've you been? 'Cause I've
never got a text that's sayin'
the loft was taken. Never..
- Last night, I was at home.
- Can you prove it?
No, I can't prove it, because Barbara's taken the
kid skiing. You'll have to take my word for it!
- Alright, guys! Come on, come on!
- Your word?!
There's a dead woman in our loft...
that only us have access to.
Now, if anybody has anything to do with
this, now's the time to say it, right now.
- Thank you, very much.
- Well, Philip's got a ball and chain, now.
- Who woulda thunk it?
- Who's the father-in-law, again?
His name's Hiram Fry. He's a...
huge property developer.
His friends call him, "The Man of Steel".
He's worth millions. Vicky's his only daughter.
- So, what's not to love?
- I just hope Philip will be happy.
Well, that's cozy.
Come on. Ever since Councilman Kotkin got elected,
Man of Steel's been busy rebuilding Downtown.
- Kotkin came to your opening, right?
- Yeah, he turned up for a photo-op.
When it comes to handing out permits and
contracts, though... game's rigged.
Wait a minute. Tell me what we're talking about,
again? 'Cause I just saw some mini cheesecakes.
Gorgeous, huh?
I mean this... whole setup.
Whoever said money can't buy
happiness, sure hasn't lived this life.
Sorry boys, you lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine, now.
Good luck with breaking this bronco,
Vicky. God knows, others have tried.
- But I'm not others, am I, Philip?
- Ho, ho! Told you!
And it's not just me. Philip's
married into the Fry family, now.
- As soon as we're back from Fiji...
 - Yeah,
well, I'm gonna sell some properties with
Vicky's dad. You know, see how it grabs me.
Wow! Grabs you.
- Well, guys, thanks for coming.
- Congratulations.
I'll be with you in a second, baby. Oh, man!
I need a break from all the ass kissing, man.
- Where is Fiji?
- I don't know, man.
Phil.
Your wedding present.
- Are you for real?
- Absolutely!
Don't lose it. There's only
five of these in existence.
Accepting a key to the loft, means
you accept rules to the loft. Marty?
What are you, crazy? Our wives are here.
Don't you think that's a bit cynical,
handing those things out here?
Cynical? It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out. Oh,
no, you're not like that.
Not now, maybe later. What about you, Luke?
Now, or later?
Come on.
Attaboy!
Well, you just make sure this
doesn't blow up in your faces.
How's it gonna blow up in our face?
It's just a room. Like Vince said.
Our room.
Now, we keep it to ourselves, alright? Tell
nobody. Just stays within our circle. Marty?
Yeah?
Yeah! Now you just need to find someone
willing to go with you, Marty.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I think there's, uh, plenty of
choices, right here. Some of these guys bring some
premium grade, high test pussy. Like
that little, dewy-eyed vixen, right there.
- She looks underage.
- Uh, she's twenty.
If one of you messes with her, I'm
gonna crack your head wide open!
Oh, what, have you got dibs on miss curly locks?
Listen, man. That's Zoe, alright?
- Zoe?
- Yeah.
-  Like, as in skin and bones, tomboy, Zoe?
- Yeah.
I hate to say it, Phil, but your
little sister is seriously hot.
- Thanks man.
- She's not little any more.
That is the finest piece of ass...
Yo, Marty, it's enough.
I'm just saying... I want to fuck
her like an animal, you know...
- Come on, Marty, it's enough.
- feel it from the inside?
I wanna fuck you like an animal.
You're not saying another word. You don't
talk about my sister, got it? You got it?
- Fuck!
- You watch it!
You watch it. Kick your ass
at your own fucking wedding.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- We met at the, uh, the building opening.
- That's right. You're... Anne Morris.
- I'm glad you remember me, Chris.
- Mmm.
I see you work weekends. What a
dedicated personal assistant.
- What a lucky city councilman.
- Hah! Screw him.
Do you?
Does it get a bit boring, walking
around all these parties by yourself?
He wants you close, but not too close.
Not when there's important people around.
I told you. I fall for the wrong men.
Can you keep a secret?
Our City Councilman likes to keep my panties
with him, at these events, in his pocket.
It's a turn-on for him.
The thought of me in a crowd, so naked...
only he knows.
- Why do you let him use you like that?
- Who says he's using me?
Maybe... it turns me on.
Maybe, me telling you about
it, turns me on, even more...
I hope you don't catch cold.
Chris.
Chris, I'm sorry. I-I... I don't
know, maybe I-I was testing you.
I don't need to be tested.
Listen, do you want... maybe get a cup of
coffee... someplace quiet... private?
I'd like to use your key. Just once.
It's not what you think.
Hey, it doesn't matter what I think. Have fun.
- Does everyone still have a key?
- Of course we do.
It's crucial we get this right.
Five keys were cut.
To make a sixth, you'd need the code, which
is in my safe. So, we can rule that out.
But there was no break-in, so
does everyone still have a key?
What, you think we've been giving away our keys?
It's against your rules, Vince.
- Then, show me.
- Well, what are we trying to prove here?
Look, I don't know. Maybe
someone's lost a key. OK?
Let-let's just rule that out. OK?
Look. Here's mine. Alright?
Chris?
You didn't use a key to get in, just then.
- No. I didn't bring it.
- Where is it?
I don't have it on me, OK? It's not like I
need it every day, like some of you guys.
- But you do still have it?
- Vincent,
whether or not I have my key on me,
right now, is really not important.
It's extremely fucking important.
- Someone got in using a key and yours is missing.
- Is that right Vincent?
Then how do you account for the
fact that the alarm was shut off?
So, let's just cut the bullshit, 'cause
it definitely had to be one of us five.
Unless...
- Unless what?
- Unless she let him in.
Oh, yeah? Then how'd she get in, Vincent?
Any way you look at it, it
keeps coming back down to us,
and I, for one, would like to
know, who's hiding something?
- Is there a word for that?
- Yes, polyamory. It's a...
philosophy, some sort of belief
system about being romantically
involved with more than one
person, at the same time.
- Uh, huh.
- And your boss get away with that?
Yes, he says that he's in love with his wife and
his girlfriend, so why should he have to choose?
- Uh, huh.
- And his wife is amazingly cool with it.
Oh, really? Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen deprived? What?
Explain. I'd like to know.
It sounds like my kind of philosophy, Barbara.
What's it called again? Polyannemarie?
Please, spare us, chubbs. You can barely
handle one woman. What would you do with two?
Hmmm. Marry one.
I would make up something. Some sort of
game that involves two ladies and one guy.
Start a trapeze act, or something.
Could you at least fake some enthusiasm?
It's your party. Anyway, I'm cooking.
You absolutely have to invite your friends over,
could you at least try and make it home in time?
They're never here, OK? Will you just join us?
I just hope the pudgy clown doesn't puke on the
rug. He's been chugging Vodka like it's Evian.
I mean, doesn't his wife see that?
Actually, she was just cool with it long enough
to catch him in the act. She hired a detective.
Cellphone records, credit card
receipts, audio, video, the works.
And, in a heartbeat, my poor boss
went from polyamory to alimony.
Man, your boss sounds mentally retarded.
So, what-what happened to him?
Oh, uh... he and his concubine are now
cramped in a tiny one bedroom condo...
but, I'm guessing he's happy. She's blonde,
23, with a brand new pair of fake breasts.
How can men stand fake breasts?
Why are women always talking about
fake tits this, fake tits that?
I mean, listen, girls, if it's a decent boob
job, who fucking cares, you know? My mom...
my mom, she's got, uh... false teeth, OK?
When she smiles, do people give her
shit and say, "Oh, my God! Look! Fake!"
No, they don't, they say, "Wow! you look
way better, now. It's an improvement."
You know, you women, you're
so catty, so competitive.
Calm down, tubby, dearest...
No, no. You know what, no? It's
nothing-nothing to calm about, Mimi.
I mean, a glorious big setup,
fucking tits and a nice
piece of ass. It's-it's-it's thrilling.
It's thrilling.
This is all... a little too highbrow for
my teeny, tiny, catty... female mind.
Oh, well, you know what? You
should have that enlarged.
Huh? And while you're under, you should
have the corners of your mouth lifted
 so you can smile every once in awhile.
Sorry. Sorry, Chris!
- Marty? Marty, come on!
- What? What? No.
No, you're class act, Marty.
Mimi, would you like to get your husband
another drink, or should I, do the honors?
You should do it, and I want it chilled...
- and then you go with her and stir...
- Honey....
The problem with your boss, Barbara,
is he didn't have his shit together.
I mean, apart, part, I mean, he didn't,
no, I mean he didn't compartmentalize.
Do you guys agree?
- Alright, Marty. How would you compartmentalize?
- How?
OK, well, since you ask. First thing first is, I
wouldn't have a place that you could get caught.
Not a hotel, not your girlfriend's crib. It's
key, right? Am I right? Vinny, boy. Am I right?
Marty, you've-you've lost us all.
I doubt that. I doubt that, Vinny boy.
It's, OK. First of all, sorry,
baby, I would just get a little,
you know, a little one bedroom
condo, or something like that.
Oh, you alright?
Mimi, your husband tends to talk out
his ass when he's been drinking, yeah?
Alright, there we go.
- Honey, would you give me a hand?
- Sure.
- Sorry, didn't know you were in here.
 - Yeah, no problem.
Hey, too much, too fast, I guess.
Thai food, you know. Yeah, it
gets all up in your nose and shit.
Yeah, it's a little spicy.
Yeah. I'm outta here. Boy.
- I need to pick up some more insulin.
- Luke... is there something you wanna tell me?
- Are you keeping secrets?
- What kind of secrets?
Is there someone else?
I don't know why you start asking me
silly questions, but the answer is no.
- I'm not cheating on you, honey.
- It's not why I'm asking, Luke.
I'm asking if there's someone else.
Listen, sweetie. Whatever I may be, or may not
be, and... I know I'm not as glamorous as some.
But I'll always be there for you...
and the children.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I want you to know... there's
a lot I could put up with...
What are you doing?
- I need to get her out of here.
- How? She is shackled to the bed!
Can't you guys see what's going on?
Someone is trying to frame us.
- Who? who wants to frame us?
- I don't know. But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's possible to move.
The Latin. The knife. Someone did this for a
reason. Hell, the cops could be here any second.
Yeah, but none of us know who this girl is.
We don't even know how she got in here.
Who else knew about the arrangement?
Who else knows about our arrangement?
Did anyone blab? Tell one of the
girls that have been up here? Marty?
What? Why me?
- It was some night you were hammered, maybe.
- I've always followed the rules, Vincent.
Did you give anyone your code. Did you-did
you key in, while someone was watching?
Absolutely not. I just told you.
Alright, wait! What's your point, Vincent?
Where are you going with this?
- Someone is trying to set us up.
- Like who?
I don't know. A-a rejected girlfriend. A jealous
boyfriend, betrayed husband. Someone with a motive.
Look, is one of you guys in some kind of trouble?
I think I may be falling in love with you.
- You don't have to say that.
- No, but, I mean it.
Why would say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?
I've never cheated on my wife before...
and I don't fall in love easily.
Chris, I don't want you to love me.
You don't even know me.
Apart from these stolen moments...
they're exciting, yeah, sure, but...
they're just moments.
- Let's change that. I wanna see you more often.
- Chris, please.
- Not just for this.
- No. Stop it.
I... I don't want you to love me.
Well, I don't wanna keep sneaking around.
- I'm gonna tell Allison about us.
- No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Anne!
- I'm gonna leave her.
- Stop it.
Why you doing this?
The people you love... they're
the only ones who can hurt you.
- I would never hurt you, Anne.
- Stop.
Stop what? I don't know what
you're talking about. Would you...
Stop it, OK? You don't know me, OK?
That's the end of it. No.
- Well, would you give me a chance, at least...
- I'm a whore... alright?
- What?
- I'm a prostitute.
I fuck men for money. Do you get it now?
Don't worry, doctor, I won't bill you for the past
- few months.
- Please, Anne, would you wait, would you...
- Chris...
- Would you wait a minute?
please stop it. You don't know
half of it, alright? Just go home.
Go home to your wife and your kids.
Is your friend, Chris Vanowen,
cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?
Oh, I-I doubt that.
Chris is a very devoted husband and, um....
And a model dad... just like all
the rest of your pals, right?
Except for you, you're not exactlty
squeaky clean, are you, Marty?
Um, I don't know what you mean.
Why does your wife want a divorce?
Divorce is not the right... What we're going
through... a separation. It's a trial separation.
Why?
Uh, because she found out something
that she, uh, wasn't too happy about.
- You fucked around on her?
- If you wanna be technical.
How'd she find out?
- The woman with whom I...
- Fucked around?
Yeah. Apparently expected something a little
more, and she showed up on our front porch.
Bitch started the... woman, in
question, started saying things.
And my only hope is that Mimi will come around,
eventually, because I love her very much.
- Did you go, with this woman, to the loft?
- What? No. This happened in San Diego.
Well, that's where you met the woman, right?
In San Diego?
Yeah.
Why you were there?
A commercial real estate convention. Vince had a
couple extra tickets, a VIP thing. You know, it's...
a couple nights in a fancy hotel and
chance to get away for a couple days.
- And nights.
- Yeah, nights, too.
Man, you see that? Jesus, Vince, those
girls are drooling all over you.
Invite 'em over. I got first dibs.
I'll be happy with second best, too.
I don't take a raincheck on that.
What? Are you fucking crazy? Why
wouldn't you invite them over?
'Cause, Marty, I'd rather die for some rare and
exotic sea creature, than shoot fish, in a barrel.
Does Barbara know about these
deep sea expeditions of yours?
- What, are you kidding me?
- Yeah! What's your problem, Seacord?
I mean, you've got a key to the loft.
What do you do up there? Laundry? Dishes?
Hey, are you guys here on
business, or what? I'm Dana.
My first time here. It's a little over
priced, for what you get. Don't you think?
Hi, Dana, I'm Vincent. This is, uh, Marty, Luke.
Can we, uh... buy you a drink?
Hey, when I said over priced I
wasn't trolling for free booze!
- No-no. I mean, I didn't say...
- Well, since you asked, what're you drinking?
- Ohhh, champagne. A girl can dream...
- Champagne?
- Please.
- Alright, one champagne coming up.
What are you doing? The fat chicks
can scare off all the hot chicks.
Marty, every fat chick has a good looking friend.
Hers is probably on her way down, right now.
OK. Yeah, well, what if she is the good looking
friend, and the really fat chick's on her way down?
- I think that's Philip's father-in-law.
- Oh, yeah, it is.
I'll be! That's The Man of Steel, alright.
That ain't Mrs. Steel.
- Think we should give him a key?
- Maybe. Not mine.
I'd like a bottle of your finest champagne, and
four glasses, please, for the table in the corner.
You, uh... were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends. You're the architect.
- Vincent Stevens.
- We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.
- Sure. What have you got in mind, Mr. Fry?
- We have a new waterfront project.
It's massive, it's... cutting edge.
It might be right up your alley.
Of course, it's all preliminary.
We have to keep it under wraps.
- I hope you can be discrete.
- Sure.
Discretion, Mr. Stevens, that's the main thing.
Dictum sapienti sat est.
A word to the wise. You are wise?
Yeah, sure! Wise, uh...
wise and discrete, Mr. Fry.
I'm in software. I can be
discrete, myself, at once.
I'll pick up their tab, as well.
Have a nice evening, gentlemen.
- Sweetheart? Sweetheart.
- Excuse me.
Hi! This is Anne. Leave a message.
Who are you calling at this hour?
Well, I'm just... checking my voicemail.
And what does your voicemail say? That
you're a lousy liar, Chris Vanowen?
- What are you talk...? Something wrong?
- You tell me, Chris.
- Allison, I...
- I'm going to bed.
Allison!
Excuse me, this is not thinking. It's
called following your dick around.
Hey, two kinds of articles,
in Cosmo, month after month.
One: Men are pigs. Two: How do
i seduce a pig to try my wood?
I don't read Cosmo, month after month!
- Well, I do.
- I don't!
- Well, I do.
- And I find it strangely...
You know what I find strangely
compelling? Grab ass.
- Huh! Can't leave you alone for a minute?
- Sarah! It's been more like an hour.
You'd think I'd have been subsidized.
Aren't you going to introduce
me to your new friends?
And that was the first time you met her?
Yeah, that was, uh... that was the first time.
Sarah?
Yeah. Her name was Sarah.
Mr. Stevens, what else happened in San Diego?
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.
Keep it down, keep it down.
- This is insane, Sarah.
- You should never dare a crazy woman.
- Vincent, we should probably go back.
- We're quiet enough, it's OK.
Mmm!
Hmm. Sorry, don't use the pool. Now you
have to keep your end of the bargain.
Come over here. That's better. Yeah...
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, don't keep us waiting. Take it off.
- I'm gonna be sick.
- What? Vince's body's
- not that bad!
- Not Vince! Shrimp cocktail!
What?! Dana... Dana! Come-come back...
come back here.
Your turn.
Take it all off.
Not bad.
Is this still too scary for you, Luke?
Are you gonna join us?
I'm-I'm fine, right here.
I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna
try and make a move on me, soon, and...
if you're here, maybe he won't dare.
Or maybe Vincent's not interested.
Maybe Vincent'd rather do laps.
That would explain the last few
hours of casual, but meaningful,
glances that each lasted a second too long.
- You like to play games, huh?
- I do.
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm better at it than you.
- Can you feel me?
- Most definitely.
Marty?
- Marty, I need my room key.
- Oh, dude!
- Kinda busy here!
- Don't stop!
- Go! Go!
- Shit!
You're scared, is what it is.
You're running away from your feelings.
I want to say goodbye.
Do you have any idea what it's
like to really love someone?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
- Throw it away. It's empty.
- You were here yesterday...
weren't you?
Guys... we gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere with this.
Chris, I think Vincent has something to tell you.
Alright, let's hear it.
- Hello?
- Who is it?
Who is it?
It's a realtor, who wants to come up.
Somebody's listed the loft for sale?
- What?!
- Oh, Jesus fucking...
Listed the loft?
She says she has an appointment
with a Deakins? Sarah Deakins?
Who-who's Sarah Deakins?
Wait... who the hell is trying to sell our loft?
- You know her, Marty.
- What?
You know her, and so does Luke.
Sarah Deakins is lying on the bed.
Hey guys, I-I promise, I have
never seen a Sarah Deakins.
- That's not true. You know her.
- Why do you keep saying that?
You met her, in San Diego. The last night,
in the bar, remember? Dana's friend.
The last night I-I was wasted out of my mind.
The whole night's a blur.
Jesus!
- Luke, you... you remember her, don't you?
- That's Sarah?
You remember, Sarah?
You-you remember her, right?
Yes, I-I remember Sarah. But how-how
was I supposed to know that's Sarah?
Come on, guys, what the hell's going on?
You guys turned her over and
looked at her face, I did not.
Yeah, I think there's been a mistake. We
don't know anyone named Sarah Deakins.
Alright, come on.
- Who is it? Do we know her?
- I don't know.
Fuck!
So, is that all you wanna tell us, Vince?
Or is there more?
I had a, thing... with her.
I brought her up here a couple of times.
But I swear on my kids, I had
nothing to do with this.
Will you just fucking tell me? Were you here with
her last night? Were you the one who let her in?
I broke up with her last night.
I swear, she was alive, when I left.
It still doesn't explain why
someone listed the loft!
Something special, or just browsing?
Why don't you return my phone calls? If you're
dumping me, at least have the decency...
Chris, how can I dump you?
There's nothing between us.
That's what it meant to you? Nothing.
Did you forget what I told you, already?
Who I am? What I do?
No, I haven't. It doesn't
change how I feel about you.
How many women have you taken to that that fuck
pad you share with your four little buddies?
What?
Please, Chris... save it for some
girl who'll actually buy your bullshit.
No, no, wait, wait. You know I'm not like that.
Here.
I only need this if I'm with you. So you keep it.
If you wanna see me again, you let me know.
Chris? Oh! What are you doing here?
Shopping for Allison?
Uhh, no, no, um, I was just...
here with a colleague.
Does your wife know you've been
sharing a loft, with your pals?
I already told you, I'm not
sharing a loft with any pals.
I was there, just once, at a party,
when the building first opened.
Then, you have been there! A minute ago, you
didn't even know where the building was.
I never took anyone up there. I
thought that's what you meant.
Well, did you know the girl?
We met once, in San Diego.
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began
a relationship with her in San Diego?
That would surprise me, frankly.
You didn't know. Isn't Vincent
Stevens your best friend?
It's so obvious, what you're trying to do here.
You're trying to turn us against each other.
But guess what? I'm not about
to start trashing my friend.
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord, that you
were jealous of you best friend?
I mean, he's nailing all these beautiful women...
I am a married man.
I'm not interested in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no... I didn't mean, jealous of him, Mr.
Seacord. I meant, jealous of the women.
Where do you get off... with an inuendo like that?
- Fucking bastards.
- Why so angry, Mr. Seacord?
Vincent is my closest friend,
and he has been for years.
Yeah, fine. But your best friend is selling
you out, as we speak, Mr. Seacord.
You and the rest of your gang.
No, Vincent would never sell out his
friends, and you're full of shit, asshole.
- What you call me?
- You heard me, you lying piece of shit!
- Look, I broke up with her and I left, that's it.
- Yeah? After you cut her up with this, right?
- Put the knife down.
- Philip!
- Put the knife... put the knife down.
- Back off.
The loft is listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.
- Someone's trying to pin this on us.
- On you, you mean!
Jesus! Get a fucking grip!
Fuck!
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.
Well, what do you wanna do, Marty?
Huh? Just leave me hanging?
Hey, Vince? Vince? Are you in there?
If you're in there, hey, man, I need
to talk to you, for just a second.
Christ, Marty! I got company.
Didn't you get my Text?
Mimi's gone!
- She's gone. Fucking gone.
- What do you mean, gone? Gone where?
She left me. She found out about
San Diego, that dumpy chick.
- She showed up and then told her everything.
- Fuck!
Wait a minute! You didn't
tell Mimi about the loft?
What?! It's not about the Goddamn
loft, Vince. It's about of my wife!
I don't know what I'm gonna do without her!
Did you-did you confess? Then, never
confess, Marty. Never confess.
Would you go to her? Just-just
tell her that I love her.
You know, and that Dana's lying.
She'll believe you.
Marty, I will straighten this out for you.
I promise you, I will straighten this out.
- OK.
- Hey, come here. OK.
- Thanks.
- OK, so, what's the plan? What do we do now?
We get her out of here.
- What? We can't just make a body disappear.
- Well, it's too bad. It's our only hope.
You had a relationship with her. Now she's some...
inconvenient piece of evidence?
- What kind of man are you?
- That's a laugh, coming from you.
And how do you plan to get her off the bed?
Cut off her hand?
Or do you have the key to those cuffs?
Do you know what? I thought handcuffs
were more your thing, than mine, Phil.
Meaning what?
You know exactly what I mean!
Shut up! Shut up! You just keep
your fucking mouth shut, alright?
- Please! Help-help me! Please, help me!
- Keep your fucking mouth shut.
- This fucking whore's trying to rip me off.
- Please, help me. He made me...
- Shut up, alright?!
- Hey, take it easy. Easy!
- Alright, alright.
- It's gonna be OK.
He's crazy!
Shit! OK, OK. Philip, give me the keys.
- Vince, she's gonna go to the cops, man.
- The keys for the handcuffs.
- She's gonna go to the cops, man!
- The keys!
You want the key? Here's the key.
He made me do things... I didn't wanna do.
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Easy!
What, you want more money? That's it, right?
It's all about the money, huh?
It's all about the fucking money!
- Here's your fucking money! It's right there!
- Jesus Christ!
The fuck is the matter with you?
Have you lost your fucking mind?
She's a whore, Chris. You know what a whore is?
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a whore.
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a whore!
You don't treat a woman like that!
You got it? Not any woman!
- Back the fuck away!
- Hey! Don't push me, alright?!
What the fuck is the matter with you, man?!
You're putting us all at risk.
- I want the police. He... he hit me.
- Shut up.
- Make the cops arrest him! He raped me!
- Shut up!
Stop screaming, or I'm gonna rip your
Goddamn throat out! I've had it with you!
You're no better than your father.
- I'm what?
- You heard me.
Oh, right, Chris. That's a nice one.
Chris had a better deal with his daddy, right?
The great guy... who wants to save everyone.
Where were you... when Zoe and I...
were getting beat up?
And mom, in the next room, pretending not to hear.
Where were you?
In your cozy, college dorm,
getting laid and wasted.
- 'Cause you didn't give a fuck.
- I didn't know anything about it.
You didn't give a crap, all those years!
We didn't exist for you.
I didn't know anything about it! If you would've
told me. If you would've said something.
- Then what, you phony! Then, what?!
- I would've gotten you out of there, Goddamn it!
Both of you!
Listen. I'm really, really sorry,
but we can't go to the cops.
Here's what I'm gonna do. No, listen!
I've a friend, he's a doctor.
- No!
- Yes,  I'm gonna drive you to him.
- He's gonna take care of you, OK?
- No.
Now, here, listen... take it. I know it's not
enough for what happened tonight, but...
He's an animal. He should be locked up.
OK. And we're gonna deal with him. I promise you.
Come on. I'm gonna get your clothes...
I'm gonna take to you the doctor.
- No!
- Easy, here we go.
No!
I'll never forgive you for this... NEVER!
What's your problem?
Jesus Christ! Why-why don't I know anything
about this? And when did it happen?
A couple of weeks ago. We decided to keep it to
ourselves, 'cause that's the kind of friends we are.
Don't lecture me, alright?
Especially, about friendship.
Oh, you-you're right, sorry. I meant
to give you the cokehead rapist lecture.
Fuck you.
Well, look, you could see how I'd
think you'd be involved in this.
I need to say something.
Shit!
- You had that coming!
- Relax. Take it easy.
You son of a bitch. You recorded...
everything that went on here?
- Every woman?
- Not every. Not always. Just... sometimes.
- At least I don't cheat on my wife.
- No, you just watch us and beat off.
- You sick fuck.
- You're a sick fuck!
Luke, did you record last night?
No. You didn't say you were coming,
which is against your rules.
And it wasn't the first time you
broke your own rules... by the way.
Now you're scared, aren't you?
Now, you know I've documented pretty
much everything you've been up to, here.
No worries, Vincent. I'll keep
my mouth shut, like I always do.
Did you see anything that can help
us out, here? Anything at all.
If all the people who've been hurt, and
cheated on, find out the truth...
What do you think will happen, Vincent?
- What's the matter?
- Just don't feel like leaving, tomorrow.
- Serious? You love skiing!
- Yes, I love to ski, but just not by myself.
Are you sure you can't come?
Hey, you know I can't come. I
can't just take off like that.
Hey. I'll call you every day. I love you
I know the drill. One hour, right?
Wrong! Have a blast. Don't mind me. Why should
tonight be any different from the past few months?
Look, Allison, if it's alright with
you, I'd rather not spoil tonight.
I'm sure it must be tempting to
grab something shiny and new.
But do you ever think about what
you might stand to lose, Chris?
- You could ruin more than just this evening.
- Tell me, are you still happy, Allison?
Oh, no! 'Cause it's for charity, my mother-in-law
is about to join the party, for a little while.
- Hearing anything about the waterfront project?
- No, he's gonna call once he gets his permits.
Well, as far as I know, everything's approved.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Ladies, you look absolutely ravishing, tonight.
- Thank you!
This is Vincent Stevens. He's the architect who
designed the new loft building,
near the sports arena.
Oh, wonderful! I love that building.
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.
As I was saying, to your
husband, in, uh, San Diego...
Gentlemen, in our business, can't afford to be...
exposed to the negative consequences of bad design.
Speaking of, uh... San Diego... How's
that waterfront project coming along?
Oh, yes, uh... we're still working it on.
We've applied for all our permits. Now we're
waiting. Standing in line, like everyone else.
You don't strike me as the type of
man that stands in line, Mr. Fry.
What about you, Mr. Kotkin.
Are you a gambling man?
And you, Mr. Stevens? You like to take chances?
As a matter of fact, I do. Especially
when I'm holding a handful of hearts.
Anyway, I don't mean to interrupt.
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the
tables tonight, as you are in love,
then I am sure you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
Blackjack.
Set aside enough for the alimony.
Mimi, what are you doing here?
Just 'cause I believed you, that
doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.
Mimikin, I wanna come back.
I know I screwed up, once. Once!
I was drunk off of my ass. I swear
It didn't mean a damn thing.
Something I don't understand about men.
If it doesn't mean anything, why bother?
I promise I'll change.
Into what, a frog? So, if you're not a
prince, how about the ass you already are?
What if I told you I wanted to
fuck around tonight? Sorry...
It would hurt like hell, wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even!
Maybe with one of your pals, huh?
Maybe Chris? He's cute.
Or how about Vincent? The night you sent
him over for that tragic, heart to heart.
Oh, Marty's really so sorry.
Mimi, you gotta talk to him.
Blackjack.
Oh! Well, look at that, chubbs!
Your first ever winning streak.
Just remember, dear heart... half of it is mine.
- You gave Zoe tickets, tonight?
- Philip, let go.
I keep her away from bullshit like
this, and you're behind my back...
Christ, Phil, she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?
Did You see her?
- God, she looks like a hooker.
- I thought you like whores.
Let her have some fun. If you'll excuse me, I'm
about to have some fun, too. I'm kinda on a roll.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.
I hope you win big time. You'll need it with all
the shit you've been packing up your nostrils.
Oh! So you noticed, a tiny fraction
of your stash went missing?
You don't like it, file for divorce.
I haven't ruled that out. Don't
forget about our prenup, loser.
While you're at it, go play some Blackjack. Could
be your last best chance of paying the rent.
Can I get some dice over here?
Anne?
Anne?
We need to talk.
- Yeah, about what?
- Your pal, the architect.
- He's playing with fire.
- I'd actually rather talk about Anne.
I'll pass along your message to Vincent,
but I'd like something, too, Mr. Kotkin.
I'd like for you to stop seeing Anne.
- And why would I do that?
- Because I love her.
Then we have more in common than we thought.
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally her choice.
Except I never paid for her.
Well, that's true. You never paid.
Stop it, Joel!
I'm going.
- What did he mean by that? 'You never paid.'
- I don't wanna love you, Chris.
- Is he saying someone's paying you to be with me?
- You're the only one who can hurt me.
Anne. Tell me it's a lie.
The first time, it was paid for.
Every other time, that was real, that was me.
- But, who paid?
- I can't.
- Excuse me. Come on, Zoe, let's go.
- I'm fine here.
- I'm asking you to go with me. Come on.
- I'm asking you to stop.
- OK, come on.
- Did you not hear the lady?
- Mind your business!
- Stop it!
What, are you deaf or just a dick, huh?
I don't know, man. What does it say up here?
Deaf or dick?
Help me out, huh?
Come on!
- Excuse me! Thank you. Excuse me.
- You're not my dad!
- Shut up!
- Alright, somebody get this guy an ambulance.
I never wanna see you again.
Not in my home and not near my daughter.
Do you got that?
Get him the hell outta here.
OK, folks, let's get back to
the gaming table, shall we?
Hey... it's OK.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's OK.
- It's not what you're thinking.
- What I am thinking?
She's my friend's sister, OK?
Are there more? Besides me, her and your wife.
What's the grand total?
Look, I can't have this conversation here.
Barbara's standing right over there.
- Do you love me?
- Of course, I love you. I'm crazy about you.
So would you choose, me, if you could?
You know it's not that simple.
Come meet me in the loft, tomorrow, OK.
We'll talk it through.
You're right, it's not that simple.
- But maybe I can make it simple.
- What do you mean?
Maybe I can help you make that choice.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah!
Sarah!
I'm sorry! Are you alright?
Don't do it, Sarah. You'll regret it.
They found out.
The wives, they did it. They set us up.
Why, Vincent?
They found it. They found out.
They found out about the Loft.
Why would you do it, Vincent? We're your friends.
- No.
- Why'd you do it?
No, it was... the wives, they... they found out.
No, it's your friends. We found out.
- What's going on?
- You still don't get it.
- Alright, let's strip him.
- What are you doing?
You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
It wasn't part of the plan. And the Latin on the
fabric! The cops aren't gonna believe that bullshit.
- Yeah, you should've done it yourself.
- Come on, let's do this.
- What'd you give me?
- What you deserve.
You killed Sarah?
- No, we just found her.
- What?
We were here, this morning,
Vincent, before you arrived.
Jesus Christ.
At first, I thought she was sleeping.
Vincent knows her?
She-she left him this.
See you in the next life.
Why did she have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.
They-they Investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.
Guys, wait. Can't we find out, where
she lives, and-and leave her there?
- Jesus!
- Philip!
Come on! We have to help out Vince.
Yeah, speaking of which,
where the fuck is Vince?
- Isn't this his problem?
- Ahemmm.
Vincent isn't here, because, um...
because I didn't call him.
You didn't call him? Why didn't you call him?
There's something I have to show you.
You've been taping us?! You fucking pervert!
You can beat the crap out of me, later. We don't
have much time, and we need to watch this.
If we get a new perspective
on what happened upstairs...
maybe you'll agree... we shouldn't
take the hit for Vincent's fuckup.
You see, Vincent... Vincent
hasn't always been a good friend.
No...
Hey, maybe I already got even...
Or maybe Vincent, the night you sent him
over, for that tragic, heart to heart.
They got here late, the night
he went to talk to her.
She was drunk, Marty. He took advantage.
Wow! Your little sister is seriously hot!
- How long has...?
- It doesn't matter.
How long?
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
They met here, on a regular basis.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
Fuck!
Gorgeous, huh?
The people you love... they're
the only ones who can hurt you.
He paid Anne... to let you seduce her.
Put the hook in, so you'd wanna share the loft.
The first time, it was paid for.
Have fun.
Chris, please, you don't know the
half of it, alright? Just go home.
He used her, Chris. Just like he used everyone.
Everyone.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
Vincent can't sense anything is up, when he
walks in. We have to try and remain calm.
We're gonna get questioned by the cops.
That's why we can never admit
we're sharing this loft.
They'll try to turn us against each other.
OK. I think this can work.
As long we follow the plan.
Chris?
OK. I'm in.
But, only if we know for sure, that Vincent
was here last night. I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does, I'll go through with it.
I'll give a signal, uh...
break something, a glass...
but nothing happens, until we
know for sure. Understood?
We've got just under two hours to set
everything up and establish alibis.
I'll take care of it. You guys get outta here.
Make sure people see you.
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.
You knew what that prick was up to.
And you never said anything.
You're just as sick as Vincent.
They met here on a regular basis.
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
You are a total fucking  psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open.
It wasn't part of the plan. And the Latin on the
fabric! The cops aren't gonna believe that bullshit!
What happened here?
You're framing me!
Swallow it. Swallow.
My own friends.
My own friends!
- Am I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.
Sarah lured you here and drugged you.
Then she killed herself, with you by her side.
Fate will unite us.
But you're gonna survive.
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?
So, you see? It was a setup. Sarah and I
were set up. The whole thing was staged.
Still sounds a little
unbelievable, don't you think?
- Unbelievable, but it's the truth.
- Yeah.
My line of work, you gotta prove the truth,
and you prove it with facts and findings.
Fact is, we only found your prints
and those of Sarah Deakins.
Yeah, because they wiped the place clean.
And we have the DVDs of all your sexual
exploits, with your prints all over them.
Luke made those DVD's! I neither even
saw 'em, let alone, touched 'em.
Yeah, but we've got no DVDs of your friends.
No DVDs of Marty's wife. No
DVDs of Philip's sister.
No DVDs of Chris' girlfriend, alright?
Facts and findings, Mr. Stevens.
And we got no evidence that
you were being set up.
Alright. Is there anything we've forgotten?
Yeah, to follow the fucking plan.
Why didn't you just handcuff her?
- She was already dead.
- Still no reason to mutilate her.
She killed herself. I just made it more dramatic.
Yeah, well, you better hope your
dramatics don't put us in jail.
Look, just-just lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break, maybe Luke, too.
Look, don't tell me how to do my work, alright?
We questioned them all.
I got no reason to believe they've been lying.
- Plus, all your friends have alibis.
- Alibis? Not for this morning, they don't.
We got Luke Seacord and Chris
Vanowen, together, at breakfast.
We got Marty Landry, at his office, alright?
At his office? Look... for at least an hour,
this morning, we were all in the loft.
So was Phil. What about Phil?
Actually, he's downstairs, right
now, with his father-in-law.
Fry? What the fuck's Fry doing here?
He just gave a statement. Saying that
he was with his son-in-law, all day.
- That is bullshit! That is a false statement!
- And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings a lot of credibility.
Credibili... I saw Fry, in San
Diego, with some... bimbo, OK?
Phil knew that. He knew I pressured Fry
into giving me a waterfront contract.
So you tried to blackmail Hiram Fry?
Vincent Stevens, enough of this crap.
We got your prints all over the DVDs,
we got 'em all over the knife.
We got you chained, next to the
dead girl, on the bed, alright?
Call your lawyer. Make a
confession and save your ass.
You're free to go. I wanna thank
you for your cooperation.
You understand, we had to check
out your friend's story.
Of course, that's your job.
There's just... one thing that's bothering me.
Why does Vincent Stevens keep
accusing his best friends?
I-I don't know. It bothers me, too.
Could it be... I just... I just wonder...
You think he's trying to hide something else?
- Wha-what, what would he hiding?
- Sarah Deakins' murder.
Murder?
But... the Detective, in the
interrogation, called it a suicide.
Well, that's what it looked like. But the autopsy
report revealed that sleeping
pills didn't kill her.
And, her wrist was cut, but not by Sarah.
Hesitation marks, those... tentative attempts,
the first ones, before a suicide
actually slashes through an artery.
The Coroner didn't find those on her.
- But, Vincent... he, uh... he would never...
- His prints are on the knife.
We didn't find a suicide note.
Is there something wrong?
We didn't find a suicide note.
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it...
Luke.
Chris! You scared me.
You sure it's smart... meeting here?
I think we have a problem, Luke.
How so?
Where is Sarah's suicide note?
You put it in your pocket.
Yeah, coulda sworn, I did.
But it's not there any more.
So, when did you steal it from my coat?
When the doorbell rang this morning?
Surprise visit, from the realtor?
Chris, it's, uh... it's unfortunate
that you lost Sarah's suicide note, but...
I had nothing to do with that.
I called the agency to ask who
put our loft up for sale.
All they could give me was a number.
I did call them. I wanted to...
I thought, maybe that...
It's over, Chris. We pulled it off.
We've got nothing to worry about, now.
But, why'd that note disappear?
The only real proof of her suicide?
Hello? Says she's got an appointment
with someone named Sarah Deakins?
Who's Sarah Deakins?
Is it because maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting?
Vincent fucked us all. You saw.
Yeah, I saw. All the DVDs
that made everybody crazy.
Went right along with your grand plan, didn't it?
But why, Luke? What did you do to that girl?
Did she get in your way? Between you and Vincent?
Actually, it was Vincent... standing between us.
Is there someone else?
Much...
Sarah! Wait.
Forget Vincent. He's better at games than you.
Always was, always will be.
He's hurting you. Using you.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you because...
because I'd never hurt you.
Just give me the chance...
to show I'd never hurt you.
That's right. You'd never hurt me.
Because I feel nothing for you, Luke.
I'm sorry.
Maybe in another life.
You were here last night?
Barbara was off skiing. So I
figured I'd find Vincent here...
- with Sarah.
- I'm sorry.
I waited 'til he left.
She said I was right about Vincent.
Consoling... I've gotten so good at it.
I gave her an insulin OD. It's quick, painless.
Leaves no trace.
Jesus, Luke.
I did it out of love... I swear.
And Vincent taking the fall for this.
It's OK with you?
Vincent used everyone and anyone!
It's about time we turned the tables!
Well, he's being charged with murder.
Yeah. Sarah wasn't dead, when
you left her with Philip.
- No... no, you're lying.
- No.
That's not possible.
What Philip did to her... was sick.
You're sick, Luke.
But... if I'm hearing you right...
it was your brother... who killed Sarah.
OK, Chris. Go home. I'll clean up.
Like always.
No.
No more cleaning up, Luke.
- Step outside.
- Luke.
Now.
Jesus! Let me help you, Luke, please!
- You gonna kill me, too?
- It's your own fault.
- What do you want me to do, jump?
- Yes, if you don't mind!
Luke! You don't need to do this. Jesus
Christ, Luke. Will you stop it?
I don't wanna hurt you, Chris. I really don't.
- So just do it.
- Never!
I called the cops, before I came.
I told them everything.
- Bullshit! I know you haven't.
- I thought I knew you.
What about the note, huh? You
want this to go down with me, too?
Give me that note, Chris. Give it to me!
It's over, Luke.
You're right. It is over.
Tell Allie and the kids... I'm sorry.
Would you do that for me, Chris?
- No,
- Come on, Chris. Be a friend.
Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke!
- They're married.
- Honey, no. They're having an affair.
- Because she's laughing at his jokes?
- No, I'm telling you they're having an affair.
Well, since when are you
the big expert on affairs?
Really?
Thanks for taking me back, Meems.
Well, what was my alternative?
To leave you wailing at
the front door, with snot
pouring out of your nose?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you off.
I have the kids early tomorrow, so I gotta go.
Are you gonna leave me here, alone?
With my wife?
- Yes.
 - Come on,
- we can at least have one more drink.
- There'll be plenty more drinks.
- Goodnight, Meems.
- Good night, Chris.
Chris!
- Anne?
- Hi.
Hi.
- You look good.
- Thank you, you, too.
Listen, I still have the key.
Do you want it back?
It won't work anymore.
Vincent's living there alone, now. It's
the only thing his wife let him keep.
- And, uh... and Philip?
- He's awaiting trial.
We'll see.
And you? You doing OK?
- Yeah. Most of the time.
- And the rest of the time?
I heard you ditched the City Councilman?
That's not all I've given up.
Uh, do you wanna grab a cup of coffee, or...?
