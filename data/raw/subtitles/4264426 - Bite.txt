(wind rushing)
(laughter) (static)
(static)
- Yours?
This is it! We're here!
On this very..
Come on.
(yelling)
- [Jill] And this
is our bachelorette.
Say hi, Casey.
- Can you turn that thing off?
- [Jill] And get your
last week of being single,
undocumented, not a chance!
- Seriously, turn it off.
- [Kirsten] Yeah I understand,
but I asked for three
beds, and there's only two.
Okay, thanks.
I need a drink.
(party music)
- Let's get this
vacation started.
I'm gonna have a piña colada.
- [Kirsten] That sounds fun.
You're a bachelorette, you
can do whatever you want.
- May I have a piña
colada, please?
Oh, don't be nervous,
we're harmless.
- [Kirsten] Don't turn away.
(laughter)
- [Casey] This is so relaxing.
- Here is to your
freakin' bachelorette!
- To me!
- [Kirsten] Woo!
- [Jill] Yeah!
- [Kirsten] Woo!
- [Kirsten] Cheers.
- [Jill] Cheers.
(trumpet music)
- Oh, it's so good. Maybe
I should've bought one.
- I think we need some shots.
We're here to have fun.
- We will.
- Jill?
- [Jill] Yeah?
- Are you having one?
- [Jill] Delicious.
(laughter)
I'd like to make a toast.
Casey! Get out here, please.
Whatever happens tonight,
know that we love you
and we care for you.
And I'm so proud of...
(Casey panicking)
- [Jill] What is it?
- There's a bug in the toilet!
- [Kirsten] What
does it look like?
- I don't know! It's a bug!
(screaming) (laughter)
- [Casey] I mean seriously,
his mother hates me.
She thinks I'm ruining his life.
- Well, of course she does.
I mean, you're taking
away her baby boy.
- Ugh, we live in
the same building.
- [Jill] She's making
sure that you're not
defiling him before marriage.
- You know, it is weird that
she's making him make you wait.
I mean, how old-school is she?
Who waits for marriage anymore?
- [Casey] Lots of rum!
(loud house music)
alcohol in here?
(loud house music)
(loud house music)
(yelling)
(laughter) (yelling)
(muffle house music)
- I just don't know.
I mean like, how do I
know that this is it?
How do I know that Jared
is actually the one?
- [Kirsten] Honey, you
are so totally fine, okay?
I mean Jared loves
you and he's smart.
And he's so...
- [Jill] He's good looking.
- [Kirsten] He good looking!
- And he's an investment banker.
- [Kirsten] He's an
investment banker.
- He's probably great in bed.
- [Casey] Guys, let's just go.
- [Kirsten] Honey...
(loud house music)
- (yelling) I'm
getting married! Woo!
Anything?
- [Kirsten] Anything.
- [Jill] Guys! Guys! Guys!
You've gotta come
hear this! Come!
- Hey, where have you been?
- [Jill] It's amazing.
Come! Hurry up!
- It's called the Buddha
Strand Sea of Stars.
It's the most beautiful
place on earth.
The water is so clear,
that once you step in it,
it's like you're
standing on the sky.
- Wow. So, how do we get there?
- You can't. It's not
really a tourist thing.
- Oh, come on.
There must be something
we can do, right?
Okay, we enter here.
- [Casey] Are we
seriously doing this?
- [Jill] We're doing this!
Get your ass in there!
(laughter)
- [Casey] Are we almost there?
- [Kirsten] I don't know.
Is that the hill?
- I don't know.
- [Kirsten] This doesn't look
like anything on the map.
- Ugh! Guys, I'm getting
eaten alive out here.
- We're here!
- We're here! Woo!
We're getting in that water.
- [Jill] I can't believe
we actually found it.
- [Kirsten] Guys, let's just go,
investigate a little, huh?
- [Casey] (yelling)
Come on Jill!
- [Jill] (laughing) Don't fall.
- [Casey] Oh, it's so nice!
- [Kirsten] I thought it was
supposed to be white sand.
- [Casey] Oh, my
god. It's so nice!
The water's so beautiful!
- [Jill] Kirsten!
(laughter)
- [Kirsten] Ugh.
- [Jill] Stick your head under.
- [Kirsten] How's the water!
- [Jill] Why don't you
come in and find out!
- Yeah!
- [Jill] You know you
gotta tell him, right?
- [Casey] What?
- [Jill] Jared, he's
got the right to know.
- [Kirsten] Jill!
- [Jill] What?
- [Kirsten] Not the
time or the place.
It's none of our business.
- I will! I will tell him.
- He wants kids
more than anything.
- I know.
- And you don't.
- I know.
I'll tell him.
Ow!
- [Jill] What?
- I just felt
something in the water.
Oh, my god! I think
something bite me!
- [Jill] Yeah, I
know, I'm covered.
- No, I mean under water, Jill.
- Oh, it's because you're
so tasty, baby. Tasty!
(gasping)
- [Jill] Oh, I just
felt something there.
- [Casey] What?
(Jill gasping) (splashing)
- [Casey] Jill?
- [Kirsten] Oh, my god.
- [Casey] Jill!
- [Kirsten] Oh, my god. Jill?
- [Casey] Jill
- [Kirsten] What happened?
- I think there's
something in the water!
- [Kirsten] Casey! Casey! Casey!
Get out! Get out!
- [Kirsten] Jill! Jill?
- [Casey] Jill?
(Jill laughing)
- You shit head!
(Jill laughing)
- I'm sorry, I had to!
- [Casey] Jill!
- [Jill] I'm coming
over. (laughing)
- You bitch!
(laughter)
- [Jill] Are you alright?
- No, something bit me.
- [Jill] Aww, are you okay?
- Yeah. It's just a little bite.
(dramatic music)
- [Jared] (laughing)
Hello, beautiful.
- Hi. You're home.
- Yeah.
- Why aren't you at work?
- Well, I wanted to
see you. I missed you.
- I missed you too, so much.
- You better have.
How was it?
- It was fun. It was a lot.
I don't even know
where to begin.
What?
- I have a surprise.
- What?
- Keep your eyes closed. Okay?
- [Casey] Okay. (laughing)
- [Jared] Alright, that's it.
Just move forward.
Okay, no peeking.
- You're really bad at this.
- Shh. I'm trying to
have a moment here.
- [Casey] If you're
taking me to the bedroom,
I need to shower first.
- [Jared] Getting warmer.
And stop.
You ready?
- I...
- I dug it out of my
mom's storage last month.
And I found a guy in the
village, that restores antiques.
It was my father's
before it was mine.
I mean, for whenever
we're ready.
- It's, it's beautiful babe.
(phone ringing)
That didn't take long.
- I can call him later.
- It's okay.
- So? Do you love it?
- I...
(phone ringing)
- Ah, damn. I'm sorry,
baby. It's Chuck.
- Tell him I say hi.
- [Jared] I wanna hear all
about your trip tonight, okay?
I promise, okay?
Hey Chuck. How you doing?
(soft music)
(beeping)
(water flowing)
Ow...
- [Kirsten] Hey, Mrs. Kennedy.
Where's the mister?
- Working. Where else?
- You serious?
You just got back.
- [Casey] Yeah, well he's
not the one on vacation.
- Okay, seriously sweetie,
you need to sit Jared down,
and tell him this workaholic
act needs to stop.
- Yeah. There are a lot of
things we need to talk about.
- The ring...
- The ring, and just...
- Honey, you're not still
getting cold feet are you?
We talked about this.
- [Casey] No, I just...
- [Kirsten] Okay, it
better not be about
that creep on the trip.
- Kirsten!
- I'm sorry. I'm just asking.
I mean, hell, I feel
guilty about it.
- No, it's just...
It's about a lot of things.
(knocking)
(knocking)
- You're back.
- Hi, Mrs. Kennedy.
- The bugs seemed to like you.
- Oh, yeah. I actually think
the insects over there,
prefer the taste of bug-spray.
- So, I was just doing laundry,
and I ran out of
detergent before I left.
Do you have some?
- A woman doesn't
run out of detergent.
Dmitri called.
You haven't decided
on the wedding band.
- Yeah, I know. I
just got back today.
But I have it on my list
to call him tomorrow.
- And the caterer?
And the florist?
You have a deposit
due for the dress.
And Myrna won't finish
the alterations,
until you pay it.
- I know.
- You know?
And still you left on some
trip, with your friends.
- Well, I'm back now.
Who would've known weddings
would be this hard, right?
- Marriage is hard.
Kids are hard.
You know nothing of either.
If you can't handle
something so silly,
so simple, as a wedding,
then I pray for my son.
Don't forget your detergent.
- This is it. We're here!
- [Jill] You look
beautiful. It's fine!
(house music)
Look at this rock!
(house music)
This is a rock!
- Woo!
(unintelligible) (yelling)
(laughter) (yelling)
(knocking)
- Hi Cyrano!
How's my favorite puppy?
I missed you so much. Yes I did!
- We were hoping
you'd stop by today.
- Hi, Mr. Matheson.
- Poor boy. He's been moping
about, for over a week.
I don't think I've seen him
this sad since Silvia passed.
- [Casey] Aww.
- So, how was your trip?
- Exhausting. It's
good to be back.
That's for sure.
- [Mr. Matheson]
Vacations can do that.
- Do what?
- Well, make you miss
the little things.
It's good to have
you back, Casey.
- Thanks, Mr. Matheson.
It's good to be back.
- Well, you two go have fun.
And thanks for walking him.
- Thanks. We will. (laughing)
Come on, boy. Come on. Come on.
Come on Cyrano. (giggling)
(ominous music)
I have to postpone the wedding.
I just...
I can't do it.
- [Kirsten] I know. And
I know it's really hard.
- I can't do it.
I'm not ready.
- [Kirsten] I know, honey.
That's why you need to
talk to him, tonight.
Tell him how you feel.
You owe it to him and yourself.
If you wait any longer,
it will be too close to
the wedding to turn back.
And how...
(clicking)
(sobbing)
- [Jared] Mom, please.
Enough already.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
- [Mrs. Kennedy]
Well, you're going to.
- [Jared] Mom, Casey and
I are getting married.
You need to start accepting it.
- [Mrs. Kennedy] You're my son.
The only good thing I have
in this wretched world,
and I will not just watch you
make the same mistakes I did.
- [Jared] For the
last time, Mom,
my fiancé is not, nor has
she ever, cheated on me.
- [Mrs. Kennedy] That's what
I said about your father.
She's not good for you.
- [Jared] I've gotta go.
I'll see you later.
(footsteps)
(knocking)
(knocking)
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry, babe.
Work was...
- Yeah.
- Are you mad?
- No. Come on,
dinner's getting cold.
- [Jared] So Chuck looks
at this guy and he says,
"What are you
fucking kidding me?
"Homeless Henry, on 9th
dresses better than you do."
Then babe, I swear to god,
Chuck looks this guy
right in the eyes,
and he says, "Get the
fuck out of my office,
"and don't come back until
you buy a decent suit."
(Jared chewing) (ominous music)
(ominous music)
Casey, you okay?
- Yeah, I just...
(ominous music)
(Jared chewing) (ominous music)
I just must have caught
a bug or something.
(Jared chewing)
- Hey, where's your ring?
- Oh, I wanted to clean
it after the trip.
It's just soaking
in the bathroom.
- [Jared] Oh, you know
you've got to watch out,
what you put your ring in.
It's white gold so...
- Jared, we need to talk.
- Okay.
- I've been thinking a lot
(stomach rumbling)
about the wedding.
And about a lot of other things.
- I know. My mom was telling me,
you're a little bit
behind on the planning.
(stomach rumbling)
She said she's totally
willing to help.
- It's not that.
(stomach rumbling)
I just...
(Jared chewing)
(stomach rumbling)
- Babe, are you
sure you're alright?
- Yeah.
(stomach rumbling)
I just...
(stomach rumbling)
(Jared chewing)
(groaning) (ominous music)
(ominous music)
(vomiting) (coughing)
(squishing)
- Casey, you alright?
- [Casey] I'm fine!
I'll be out in a minute.
(toilet flushing)
- [Jared] That
didn't sound good.
- Must be the food
from the trip.
You know me...
- [Jared] Well, I guess
we're done with dinner.
- Sorry.
- Come on, let's get you
to bed, get you some rest.
- [Casey] Okay.
- Touchdown.
How you feeling now?
- Better.
I'd like you to stay.
(chuckling)
- You know, when I
got a place here,
to help my mom
with the building,
I thought I was only gonna
be here for a couple months.
I couldn't wait to get back
to the upper east side.
And then I met you.
And I didn't want to leave.
- Your mother won't know
if you stay the night.
- Have you met my
mother? She'll know.
- She hates me.
- What? That's not true.
- She does. You won't even
sleep here because of her.
- She's just a little old
fashioned, that's all.
Hey, listen to me.
I love you.
And next week, you and I
will be husband and wife.
And after that, we'll
leave this place.
And we'll start
our lives together.
She'll come around,
you'll see. Okay?
- Okay.
- Casey...
- [Casey] Come on.
- Casey, we should wait.
- [Casey] Shut up.
- Casey...
- Shut up.
- Casey...
- [Casey] Shut up.

- [Jared] Casey?
- I'm fine! Everything's fine!
- What the hell was that?
- [Casey] I'm fine!
It's just a small bug
bite from the trip.
- Well, it looks infected.
- Yeah, I have
some cream for it.
Just gonna take a bath
first, wash it out.
- Really? So we're done here?
- You have an early morning.
You should go before
your mom notices.
- Well, are you at
least gonna say goodbye?
- Good night.
- [Jared] Well,
have a good night.

Flake much?
- Sorry. Rough night.
- You too?
It is like the
worst diarrhea ever.
I told Kirsten we shouldn't
have drank the water.
- I know, right?
- Well, look at you,
miss Molly Homemaker.
He must've known
something was up,
if you cooked for him.
So? What did you say?
- I didn't tell him.
- You didn't tell him?
Jesus, Casey, the
wedding is in a week.
- I know. I know.
I just couldn't tell him.
Last night, I couldn't tell him.
- Hey, it's okay. It's okay
Honey, you know I
love you, right?
And I love Jared too.
- [Casey] Yeah.
- He's a great guy.
He's established, he's
mature, he's good looking,
and he's ready.
But, honey, you're not ready.
If nothing else, our
trip proved that.
Did he notice your ring is gone?
And you lied to him
about it, I assume.
Oh, honey, it's okay.
Oh, it's alright.
You're gonna be
fine. You'll see.
(groaning)
What?
- One of my bites, I think
it's infected. It hurts.
Look, ever since we came
back from this trip I...
- Oh, tell me about
it. Look, I'm covered.
But I went to the
dermatologist, yesterday,
and he gave me this cream.
You need to use it. It helps.
- [Casey] Yeah.
- But I have to get
to work, honey, okay?
I'll talk to you later?
- Yeah, yeah.
(door closing)
- [Jill] Kirsten? Kirsten?
Get up. It's Casey.
- Is she okay?
- [Jill] I found her.
I don't know. Let's go.
(Casey crying)
- [Kirsten] Casey?
Casey, what happened? Casey?
Casey! Casey, wait.
Casey...
(Casey coughing)
Oh, my god, Casey?
(Casey coughing)
- [Jill] Did someone have
a good time last night?
(Casey coughing)
- I don't know what happened.
I woke up naked on the beach.
Everything was gone.
My clothes, my purse...
The ring, my ring
is gone. (crying)
- [Kirsten] Where
the hell did you go?
- I don't know! I
can't fucking remember.
(crying)
Jill, are you filming this?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
(slamming)
- Turn it off.

- Morning, Casey.
- Hi, Mr. Matheson.
- Dear, you're as
pale as a ghost.
- Yeah, I must have
caught a bug down south.
I'll be fine.
- You have to watch
it down there.
They have all sort
of weird critters.
- Cyrano?
Hey. Come on, let's
go for a walk.
- [Mr. Matheson] Hmm. Cyrano?
That's very strange.
Cyrano, come. Come on, boy
Come see Casey.
- Come on, you lazy dog. Come.
- [Mr. Matheson]
Cyrano, come here.
Cyrano!
(Cyrano whining)
(Cyrano whining)
I don't know what's
gotten into him.
I'm sorry, Casey.
Maybe he's not
feeling well either.
Maybe he just wants
to stay in today.
We can try it again tomorrow.
- Yeah. Okay.
I'll come by in the morning.
- We'd look forward to that.
(whining)
- [Kirsten] Hello?
- [Casey] Hey.
- [Kirsten] Hey, what's up?
- What are you doing?
- [Kirsten] Are you
sure about this?
About postponing?
When are you gonna tell him?
- I don't know.
Tonight maybe.
- You know, why don't
you just sleep on this?
It just seems a
little impulsive.
- Hey, have you been sick
at all, since our trip?
- Yeah, I've been
tired as a motherfuck.
I'm telling you, I am
never traveling again.
Why? Are you okay?
You know, you
don't look so good.
- Yeah. I don't know.
I can't eat anything.
I can't keep food down.
- Maybe you're pregnant.
- What? Don't even say that.
- [Kirsten] Are you sure?
- [Casey] Yes.
I'm not pregnant. I'm not.
I can't be. It's not possible.

- [Counselor] Hi, Barker's
After Hours Clinic.
- Hi, I was in Costa
Rica last week,
and I got bit by
something in the water.
- [Counselor] Okay,
what did it look like?
- I don't know. I didn't see it.
- [Counselor] Are you
looking at the bite mark now?
- Yes.
- [Counselor] And
what color is it?
- Red.
- [Counselor] Does
it look infected?
- Yeah, and it hurts.
And there's this
weird white liquid,
that just keeps coming out.
- [Counselor] Okay,
that's just pus.
Have you put any
antiseptic on it?
- No.
- [Counselor] Well, that's
the first thing you should do.
Any over the counter
corticosteroid,
should kill the infection.
- Okay.
- [Counselor] As
for the vomiting,
it may be cause by the
infection, or maybe not.
You should probably see your
physician to know for sure.
- There's one more thing.
I'm pregnant.

- No, this is exactly
where I should be.
I've had complaints
about the smell.
What is this?
I know what you are.
You harlot! I asked
you for one thing.
Do not soil my son,
out of wedlock.
You couldn't even do that.
You're filthy.
Look at this place!
You're disgusting!
I know that is not my
son's child in you.
(clicking) (chirping)
So tell me the truth.
Whose child is it?
- [Casey] Please leave.
- When I tell him tonight,
the wedding will be canceled.
And you and your bastard
won't get a penny from us.
Whose child is it?

Come on, fill me in here.
Give me a call.
Something, please.
Anything...

Casey, open up.
Casey, I'm coming in.

Just open the door. Let me in.

I can't do it!
- What do you mean you
can't do the wedding?
- I'm not ready.
I can't do it!
- Just open up. We need
to talk about this.
- I love you, Jared!
(clicking) (chirping)
I just need some time,
(chirping)
to figure things out.
- Casey, open the door.
Casey, open the door.
(knocking)
Open up!
(knocking)
Jared, leave!

Jill, open the door.
(knocking)
- Oh, hey, what's up.
- Why are you avoiding me?
- What? I'm not,
I've just been busy.
Why? What's the emergency?
- In case you haven't noticed,
Casey's been M.I.A. for a week.
She's not answering any
of my calls or texts.
- Yeah, I know. I got
her voicemail too.
I just wanted to give her space.
This whole decision with Jared,
she must be taking
it pretty hard.
- Well, yeah, you think?
You know what? We went
on this trip together,
and we said we'd watch
out for each other.
And look what happened.
This is our fault. All of us.
- Give me a break,
Kirsten, okay?
She made her own
decisions down there.
No one forced her
to cheat on Jared.
I don't remember signing
up to be her babysitter.
- Wow. Jill, nice.
You know what? Whatever.
Regardless of what you
think happened down there,
we need to figure out
what's going on with her.
- She's probably just
lying in her bed crying,
and eating a huge
tub of ice cream,
watching a shitty
Dabrowski movie.
She'll be fine.
- Honestly, I don't know.
Something feels off.
I really don't think
she's just ignoring us.
I stopped by her
apartment yesterday.
And she didn't answer but...
- But what?
- I smelled something
coming from inside.
Something really bad.
I'm just...
I'm just worried that she...
- (laughing) Come on, Kirsten!
She would never do that.
She's way too much of a pussy.
- Jill, what the hell
is wrong with you?
You know, just because
you're cool with
being a whore, doesn't
mean everybody is.
- Wow.
Okay.
Well, it was great seeing you.
Thanks for stopping by.

I know.

we went on vacation,
I got so sunburned,
literally like,
bubbling up on my shoulders.
- Come on! Don't tell me that.
I just want to enjoy this trip.
Just tired of hearing everyone's
travel horror stories.
- I'm just telling you so you
don't make the same mistake.
Get plenty of sunscreen.
I am telling you, the sun in
Costa Rica, is relentless.
- Okay.
- (laughing) Your pale skin is
gonna light up like a match.
- I'm not an idiot.
I'll wear sunscreen.
- Okay, I'm not an idiot
either, and it happened to me.
Okay? I'm just saying.
- I just wanna go away,
and relax and not
worry about anything.
Sunburns, I can deal with.
I just don't want to get sick.
(insect buzzing)
Ouch!
(squishing)
- Oh, my god. That
is so disgusting!
Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a little bite.
