***** aue*****
 What the fuck is this music?
Leave it!
- Seriously. In my car!
This was in your glove locker!
You're going from the second...
- The third doesn't work.
He is changing from the second to
the fourth. Don't you know how to drive a car?
You are breaking the clutch.
- Fuck the clutch, I'll put it to your ass!
Dude, you are now changing from the 2nd
to the 3rd and then to the 4th.
Shut the fuck up, boy, shut up!
- What? - Dude, yo, that's him!
that's him! - What are you doing?
Not here in the street, man!
If cops see my register plates
they gonna shoot me!
"A man is a man if he
can survive a shot" - Shut up and pull over!
Dude, are you Hakan?
Why?
- Tell me! Are you Hakan?
Who wants to know?
We're looking for some Hakan. We want
some correct ott!
Well, how much do you want?
- Well... come over here!
Leave him! What the fuck?
- Who do you get the stuff from?
From who? - Scholle, man!
His name is Scholle and he's from Horn.
Now leave me!
- Listen, man!
You are out! I am here now.
Remember my fucking face! I am Chiko!
Chiko, got some ott?
- How old are you?
It's for my brother. - Your brother
got deported, man. Fuck off!
Yes, mum... Come here, dude!
Dude I was having a crazy dream!
I was at some square,
like in some stadium.
And there were awsome cars all over,
like in this one movie we watched at Turan's.
What was its name?
"The Fast and the Furious". - Exactly.
All the cars were lowriders, man.
Anywhere there were those cars
an me in the center...
Tell her it's nothing bad, man. - What?
Anyway, man, there were those cars,
just standing there.
The thing is: they were all the same
brand. Do you know which one?
Tibet! Those were all
my fucking lowriders, dude!
Mrs Özcan, if you still want ice cubes, tell me. 
- Yes.
This is so fucked up,
this whole shit here.
Imagine I would reall own
all these lowriders with my name on them.
I'd be so fucking rich
I'd buy thousands of kidneys to my mum.
Someone told me he knows Romanians
who are selling kidneys, hearts and stuff...
Forget it.
You can't afford it anyway.
If you show to god that you
believe in him... really believe,
he'll help you even through the deepest shit.
Let me talk.
- Why? I want to talk this time.
You're going to screw it up again.
- No. - I'll do it.
Are you Scholle?
- Yes.
We want some good ott.
Yeah, sit down, dude.
Dudes... dudes!
Two... two dudes!
Ey, Tibet!
Sit down, now. Stop it!
Is one thing enough?
That's all I got.
Amsterdam?
Amsterdam? Do I look like some college student
Venlo!
Smell! Get what I mean?
You don't get this everywhere!
Check this out!
- Dude!
Do not touch! Take your dirty
hands off my private stuff.
Don't touch anything!
You are out
I will continue here now.
Dude! Dudes!
What is this big idea?
Are you crazy? - Did you hear
this wanker talking to me?
Shut the fuck up! Its wasn't
planned like this! Look at all the Od!
Ey, Spasti!
You'll go to your boss now
and tell him I fucked you! Look!
Remember my fucking name.
If he wants something
he will come to me. Taman-mi?
Man, where is the remote control for this?
Fuck!
Hey! Everything cool?
Watch out. Now you have to be
careful with the fire.
Now put it there on the table.
Great!
Give your daddy the fork, will you?
Come here.
Where have you been on monday actually?
You wanted to pick her up. 
- I didn't have time.
You're never there. And if you are
you are an asshole. - Damn, Jill, don't annoy me!
Where is your present? - I wanted to get one
but the fucking shops were closed.
Wait here.
Ayleen, look! See what
Daddy has brought for you!
Should we unpack?
- I don't know...
...what is in there. 
- You can never know with presents!
You know what's that?
- A frog!
The frog prince it is. Will you
give Daddy a kiss? - Yes.
Stop it!
No!
The logo was some kind of red-yellow mix.
The colors were awsome.
And the rims were turning inside the wheel...
Youssef, hier! Come over here!
Come on now!
You're only standing there!
Stop pushing me!
- What do you want, man?
Man that was a foul!
Goal!
I was not ready yet. Get it?
- Great shot! Did you see that?
A man is a man if he can
survive a shot.
Come on, go get the ball!
Chiko, come here!
Are you Chiko?
- Yes.
One friend of mine wants to see you.
Fucking great car, man. Awsome car.
I want to have a Mercedes one day
But a white one.
Want a drink?
- Beer.
But in a bottle, not in a pint.
- No pint? Scholle, want a beer, too?
Jenny, give us two beers please, and one Vodka.
- Alright, Brownie. 
No pint? Why not?
In case of trouble it's easier to hit with a bottle
than with a pint.
How come? Are you that kind of
guy that is beating up others?
Yeah, man, if I win something with it.
- Yeah, problems!
Fuck, Jenny! I said my
throat is aching. Take the ice out!
Sorry, Brownie.
OK, now tell me.
How do you want to fix this shit?
Kick him out.
Take me in.
What the fuck are you laughin? He
is dissing you and you don't even realize it.
Seriously now.
What were you thinking when he said: "Someone
fucked me and hit me in the face!"
What should I have thought?
- But what would you think if he'd said:
"Someone wanted to fuck me but I hit him in the face."
Do you understan? You got the wrong
man. I do not let anyone fuck me.
Wait a second.
You are running around, beating up my people
and I should employ you?
Why do you think I did so?
It was the only way to get in contact with you.
That's why I am here.
I want to work for you.
Can you sell 10 "things" of gras
in 10 days?
Yes. I'll involve my best friend.
He's a great guy, with him I can do it..
I make you an offer. You get 10
on credit and a flat.
You sell everything within 10 days
Only inside that flat! Not on the street!
And I want 4 per kilogramm.
No problem.
Let's drink to our brother Scholle.
- To Scholle!
What you're looking at? No wonder you don't
get respect if you look like a pussy.
Try to wear a hat.
Jenny, bring us a hat. -  Yes.
How the fuck you want to
sell the whole shit in only 10 days?
Yeah but if we manage
we'll get a job.
Why should I want a job from this wanker?
He's a music lecturer or something. - Producer!
Not lecturer, producer. 
- That's the same. - It's not!
Lecturer is in the University 
- Whatever! Like this we are much closer to him.
See: We gonna fuck him and piss straight
into his face and he doesn't even realize it.
Great, and what for?
- Respect. If you wanna be the best,
you need to be respected and therefor
you must not show respect to anyone else.
If you don't show respect to anyone, at some point people
will think that you invented the respect yourself.
This is a lecturer, understand?
This is a lecturer. Seriously!
That's nice. - It's nice in here
- Okay, man, let's go!
(Stöhnen aus der Nachbarwohnung)
(Frau in Nachbarwohnung auf Türkisch:)
Man, the woman is turkish! I told you
this was a brothel!
Shut the fuck up
I am trying to count!
I am sure that's all
the whores of that guy!
I am getting a boner. Let's go fuck her.
- No, not a turkish girl.
What else then?
A polish, a mongolian, whatever.
What, is there also disabled ones?
- Not a mongoloid! A Mongolian!
Why should I take a mongo?
She is turkish!
Tibet, if a turk is fucking a turk
she'll want to marry him! That's how it is.
What if we're not turks?
Let me talk.
This was my idea, i want to talk.
Let me handle this, you'll just screw up
- Why screw up? Asshole...
Hi.
- Hi.
We're friends of Brownie.
Are you free?
Yes.
Are you turkish?
- Yes.
We're Afghans
- Aha.
So who wants first?
Well...
- I don't know.
Let's do a sandwich
- Hä?
A sandwich! He's in front, I'm behind.
Or do you want...? - No, no.
What's going on here? - What?
- Do you want to bullshit me?
Fuck off!
- Chill out, we just wanna fuck!
Fuck each others, do you think I'm doing porn?
- Fuck each others?
What the fuck?
Do I look like a gay? - Yes!
Fuck off! - Who are you
talking to, bitch? - Come on now!
Always the same shit!
- Shut up you fucking whore! - Let's get out!
Get lost, get the fuck out of here!
- Bitch! - Dude!
Hey, I think you're really hot!
Hi, everything cool?
Are you free?
- I'll have some customers.
These are four customers for half an
hour. Want a sandwich?
What's your name?
- Meryem.
I am Chiko.
- What is this shitty name?
Everyone calls me that. Always.
It's because of my last name: Cikar.
What's your real name? - Isa.
- That means "Jesus", right? - Yes.
Meryem means "Maria".
Do you believe in god?
And you?
Well, I believe in his power.
That's why he is god.
Everyone respects him.
You're nuts.
Do your parents know what you're doing?
- I'm in contact with my mom only.
She thinks I study here. And you?
My mother is at her sister's
my father went back to Turkey.
Do they know what you're doing?
- I don't give a fuck about them.
Tibet's mother is my mother.
I would do anything for her. Anything.
You know, somehow Isa
suits you much better than Chiko.
Do you think the guy can fix us a lowrider?
Tibet, don't talk any bullshit.
Do us a favour, let me do the talking.
Just let me do the talking.
If he gives us a car, I want a lowrider.
-Wait a second!
Tell him about me.
Maybe he still needs someone.
Siktir, Lan! He wants to meet me.
- You'll get a trabant!
Trabi-Rider, man! Are you nuts?
You did this, fucker.
Dude, check her out.
Hey, man! Everything cool?
- Everything cool.
Here, look. Tibet... Sascha.
- How are you?
Brownie called, he wants to talk to us.
- He's in his office.
Should I go get him? - Yeah, do that.
- Quite tall guy!
Like a bear.
Wow, everything out of leather in here.
- Yeah, look, wood and everything.
Dude, Chiko, let's leave.
What's wrong? - Let's just go.
I think he's not here.
Come here and sit down.
He'll have time in five minutes.
He wants to see you first.
What? Alone? - To get to know you.
- That's good. Go.
He will come here anyway, right?
- What are you talking, now go!
Did you watch this new show?
He's looking for his wife.
Out of hundreds of women he was tasting her
With eyes closed.
Tasting? 
- Then he was licking them, then touching...
They were giving him everything:
Ass, pussy, one smelled like salami
another one like steak.
Are you Tibet?
- Yes.
Do you have something to tell me?
- What?
You don't have anything to tell me?
- No, what?
You don't know or what?
- No. What's wrong?
What?
- What you motherfucker?
Are you a motherfucker?
Selling stuff on the street behind my back?
No, man!
- My people where watching you all the time.
In your packs there was always missing 1 gramm.
- It wasn't me! - Wasn't you?
Put him on the table, put him up here.
- I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything!
Don't you have the fucking balls to tell me the truth?
you little cunt, I am going to beat
your fucking teeth out - No. No!
Okay, man, leave it!
I was stealing!
I was stealing, okay!
- Fucking cunt! Put him like this!
Stop it!
- Put him more up.
Stop, man, please, stop.
Stop it, please.
- Fucking cunt!
Give me the nail.
Keep him tightly. Keep the leg.
Stop! - You wanna kick my ass?
 - I'll give everything back!
Will you now think harder next time?
Will you think harder? Fucking cunt.
Listen, your little homo friend
was trying to fuck with me.
Next week I'll see you with the cash
otherwise you got a real problem.
Make sure he is taking that little wanker with him.
- Ey, what's up? What?
Shit!
Come on - Take his legs!
- It's bleeding like shit.
What the fuck did you do?
You idiot, what did you do?
I did it for my mother.
I wanted to get her something?
What?
Are you messing with me or what?
- Hey, what's the deal?
Are you fucking retarded?
- She needs a fucking kidney!
What are you talking about?
- Do you think you can buy her a kidney with this?
Let that be my own issue.
- Now that is our issue!
Isa...
Dad, I need to talk to him just
for two minutes.
Really short.
The thing will go like this:
I'll meet this guy
and give him his fucking money.
And after that we gonna fuck him!
What do you mean, "fuck him"?
- I'll shoot his foot off!
You gonna shoot his foot off...
And then?
Chiko, what then?
Don't know. Continue somewhere else. Whatever.
- Shitty plan. Imagine the cops catch us
Or that guy..
Chill out, they won't catch us.
- You know what I don't get?
Why don't you give him the cash and you're even.
- We're even when he walks with a limp!
But Tibet was the one fucking around. Nobody else.
- He is my brother.
He is mine, too.
- Whatever.
(Father swearing in turkish)
- Yeah, I am coming!
You know if anything happens
my father's gonna fuck me. He'll fuck me.
This shit is too heavy, man.
It won't work.
Alright then. See you.
Okay, this is the last time. Okay?
What up, man?
- Everything cool? - Sure.
First hand.
My brother brought it from Italy.
Gut?
- Very good, thanks.
This is the place?
- Yeah, turn off the lights!
Ok!
- Are we there yet?
Yeah, the wanker should have booked a
table for 9 o clock. Drive slowly.
Stop the car right here, man.
- It's okay, relax. - Leave the engine running.
Okay, I'll go inside now.
It might take a while, don't panic.
I'll give him the money and try to make him come outside.
Are you listening to me?- I am!
- I am serious, never take your eyes off the door!
Man, when I am done we really
need to fuck off, okay? - Okay.
Alles klar.
Check the door, will ya?
He likes his chocolate pudding.
Over here!
Alles klar?
Sit down, sit down.
So, how are you? Alles gut?
Wanna eat something? Eat something
it's really good. Darek, can you
bring us the meatballs with the green stuff!
Thanks. Chiko...
this is my wife Rejy.
Rejy... Chiko.
This is the boy I told you about
- Ah ja.
And this is my little prince.
This is Niko.
Listen, tell the uncle about
the movie. The one with the muscle-man
and the big knife.
What was the name?
- "Dumbo".
He means "Rambo", dude.
He means "Rambo".
Ey, Darek!
Where the fuck are the shitty meatballs?
Mina, Mina! Come here
Take him with you. I want him to dance!
Dance!
- Come on.
Watch out!
- Sorry, Brownie.
I am really sorry.
- It's alright.
Alles klar?
- Alles klar.
Fuck, Alter!
This fucking wanker.
This is Egyptian cotton
Imagine that
actually this place belongs to a friend of mine
the guy there, a Polish one.
He is doing a good job but he's
always taking in these wankers from Warszow
who don't know shit about anything.
Hanging out, annoying the people
Twice, dude, seriously. Some random
fucking customers were eating
then they left, and their cars were missing.
Missing. Can you imagine that?
Fucking wankers.
My ass, boy! Fuck!
Know what? I gotta stop talking like this
I tell you, my kid is starting
to remember and speaking like this.
At some point, lately, we're sitting at dinner
and what does he say? "Cunt"!
And my wife is freaking out, you know?
Digger, my parents were
sending me to private school.
Didn't really help much.
Know what I mean?
My wife is smart, you know?
She has put up this thing
In our kitchen there's a penny bank.
Some little piggy.
Every time I say
some shit like "fuck"
I have to pay 50 cents.
We got the thing 10 days ago
and there is already 340.
Imagine that!
Alles klar?
I know exactly what you're up to.
I'm not stupid. You're coming here
to tell me your friend is alright,
he didn't mean it. He's sorry.
Oh, damn.
I am through with him.
But I don't have any problem with you.
You're alright.
I can picture the two of us
working together, you know?
What are you dealing with
this kind of retard anyway?
You're way ahead of him.
I tell you one thing:
He's gonna fuck you up.
One day he'll fuck you up.
That guy, ey...
He will pull you down
believe me. He'll destroy you.
You got the cash, right?
- Yes
Good.
You know something about
Dash and Coca?
Something I guess.
- I am doing weed deals only part-time.
I got some plans. Something
bigger. Germany-wide.
That'll make money.
Real money.
I'll need someone.
Someone I can trust.
Could you imagine that?
- Yeah, I guess.
What the fuck is that answer?
Yes or no?
Yes
Good
Chiko, let's celebrate.
What's the deal?
Where have you been all the time?
Let's go.
What's wrong?
- You should've shot the wanker right away.
I would never work for that son of a bitch
if he'd done anything to you.
I would fuck him up.
- We'll do it when we don't need him anymore.
You're Chiko?
Get in.
Fasten your seat belt.
Tonton. - You're the one who owns this tavern.
 - Exactly. - Nice place.
Thanks. Brownie said you didn't have
much to do with coke?
No. No coke. Only weed.
- Alles klar.
Listen. My task is today
to show you how to cut the stuff.
There for we need to take the car apart.
I have been shopping.
You like knitting?
Yeah, Socks and stuff. I give them to poor kids.
Are you knitting for your customers?
- No, I just fuck them.
Do you kiss your customers?
- Fuck off, you know how they stink sometimes?
Cocks stink and you anyway suck them.
- Yeah but there's always a condom.
If I put a condom on my tongue
are you going to kiss me?
I don't kiss customers. That's too intimate.
- Bullshit!
Come on, give me a condom.
- No way.
Give me a condom, I'll kiss you now.
- Go kiss your mother. - Come here
Come on now.
- Stop it. Fuck off! - Come here
What is the big deal? Open the door
I just wanna kiss you, man!
Mama, I'll go outside for a while.
- What? - I'll go outside for a while.
Yeah, bye. - Bye.
Curly!
Ey, Curly!
What up? - What are you doing?
- Helping my father painting the walls.
Come down here. Chiko called.
Brownie wants to talk to me.
Really?
- Yeah, you gotta give me a ride there now.
My father's gonna shoot me
if I leave now.
A man is a man when he can survive a shot.
- Yeah but I won't survive this one, believe me.
Don't be such a homo.
What homo? My father is in bad mood.
I can't leave. Sorry.
Ey, Siktir, Lan...
Then I have to walk, you wanker.
Man, don't get mad now. I am coming.
5 Minuten. Dude. Seriously.
Hey, this is Tibet.
I am busy.
Hey, it's me.
Give me a call.
All the time I get into some trouble because
of you two. I am getting tired of it,
understand? I'll wait for 10 minutes
then I'll go home. I don't care!
You can take a bike then.
Starting now, right?
10 minutes. Time is running.
Don't forget to watch the time.
Dude, I am talking
to you. What's the deal?
What the fuck is that doing here?
- Shut it!
Damn, who the fuck is that?
- Put that away! What is wrong?
Man, are you retarded?
- Don't fucking talk to me!
Keep me out of this, I am not taking part in this.
- Start the fucking car.
Do this shit on your own.
- Shut it! Start the fucking car.
I can't stay behind him. He'll notice us.
Switch the fucking lights off.
Fucking shit.
This is sick. This is sick.
Wait. Wait a second. Tibet!
Think for a second. Please.
Do you understand what you're doing?
Fucking shit.
That's Chiko, man. That's Chiko!
What's the deal? That's Chiko!
Shit, he is looking here.
Heys, this is Tibet.
I am busy right now.
Are we friends or what?
What is wrong with you?
Are you stupid? Fuck off!
You're just as pussy as all the others.
- You're insane, man!
Why don't you tell me about this kind of thing?
Man, why not?
- Don't piss me off! - Fuck you!
Here. Stop.
Here. Take it.
- Thank you.
Asshole, come here.
- Chiko, calm down. Leave him.
What the fuck was that?
What do you want? - You were going to finish him.
 So? Isn't that my business?
When he notices, it will be my business, too.
- Why? You're his best mate anyway!
You're dressing like him, talking like him.
- Guys, chill out now. You, too, Chiko.
You're just fucked up cause I manage and you don't!
- Yeah right.
Without me you'd still be that
fucking junkie on heroine.
Ah so it's because of you that I am
off heroine. So tell me then,
Are you the greatest now, some Pablo Escobar?
- You can't be like me.
Go your own fucking way.
Come on, leave that wanker.
So that's it then. Where're you going, you fucker?
- Put that thing away.
Do you want to blow me away?
- Are you idiot or what?
What?
Are you nuts? I'll call the police.
- What do you want, you cunt?
Chiko come here.
God! My ass. My ass.
- What's wrong?
You know what, man? Get lost.
Fuck off.
For me this shit ain't over.
You are here with Mr Adler?
- Yes. - Then follow me please.
How is your daughter actually?
- What?
You didn't even tell me you're a father.
 - How do you know?
I just know. - How?
- What's your problem?
Your friend told me.
- Which one? - What do you think which one?
Has he been here or what?
- Yea
I don't want you to fuck with him.
- What? - The guy is fucked up.
Man, the guy is still a little kid.
- I don't want it. Understand?
You're not my pimp,
you're just a customer.
I got customers! Hey!
Hey!
- What do you want from me? - Get out!
Leave me alone.
- Get lost.
I payed.
- Fuck off, you wanker!
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you fucking insane?

Everything's fine
I just want my stuff back.
- Yes?
Hey, Gypsy-Man.
- Chiko-Man!
Fuck off.
Hey, fuck off now. - Jaaa!
What are you doing here?
Didn't feel like being in hospital anymore
There's only sick people.
Does it still hurt?
- A bit. When taking a shit.
A man's a man when
he can survive a shot.
That's not how you become a man, dude.
Yesterday,
I was laying in hospital.
Being bored. Looking outside the window.
There I see my name in the clouds
- Really written in the clouds?
Just "Curly". Out of the shape
Okay.
I'll stop with all that shit.
Nuts? Jamil, nuts?
He understands only arabic..
What are "nuts" in arabic?
- Fistik. - Fistik?
Chiko, hey! Samir, Jamil... Chiko.
Nice to meet you.
- Jamil speaks only arabic.
Should we start going?
- I guess.
How come a Polish is owning an arabic restaurant?
What do you mean? The continents
have all been connected at some point.
You're talking bullshit
- Listen
I was thinking, cause it's our first day together
I could lower the price about 5 thousand
Nice one, my friend.
- So let's see then.
Notes of 100?
- Yes.
What's this small amount?
What is this?
Don't you want to show us the Komo first?
- First the money, then the stuff.
Come on you know how it's going.
First the goods, then the rest.
Yes I know how it's going. So, give me the money.
- He's unbelievable.
Haggling like at some bazar.
- We're not at any bazar!
Put your fucking hands up
Turn around! - Don't do anything stupid now
Get down, wanker
Back off! To the wall
- You have no idea, what you're doing here
Where is the shit? - What shit?
- Where's the fucking Komo?
Tell me where it is
Where's the fucking Komo? 
- Inside the blue cooling box. In the corner.
You have noe idea
what you're doing here.
You won't get far with this.
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Do you have a clue what you are doing?
- Shut the fuck up
Fuck you and your whole shithead
Polish idiot family
Put it in your mama's ass, fucking desert nigger
 - What?
Drop it, you cunt
Drop it, man. Turn around
Turn around or I am going to blow your
brains out. Towards the wall
Tonton?
This didn't go so smoothly
But I'll take care of it.
You did a good job.
You gotta fuck off Hamburg for some days. Get out of this shit,
You look like crap.
Do some wellness.
Take this.
Call me if you need something.
There is something
I want something else
One of your girls.
The Turkish one
You know I have been thinking.
About me, you. This and that.
I want to be with you
You won't need to work anymore.
Why should you?
This is how I want to live with you.
We could make some kids,
have some cats, dogs, whatever
Hm?
You know, sometimes you remind me of
my father. The way you talk,
the way you walk... everything.
One day he was beating up my mother
and she fucked off.
I don't know. I am somehow afraid
that I could regret this.
You know, with me it's the other way around
I am not afraid to regret anything.
I regret it to be afraid.
Being afraid does'nt lead you anywhere.
This is for you.
What's this? Did you make this?
Like it? - Let's see.
What are you doing?
Man, not in here
How is he?
- Bit better. He's inside
Tibet is fucked up.
He wouldnt manage to do this.
Maybe not alone
You think there was someone else?
You tell me.
Did you know about it?
No
Did you know about it?
No, man
I don't want to believe there would
be something wrong with you
Cause if there'd be, it would really fuck me up
And I would fuck you up then
Finish him
You finish him and I'll
know what's the deal with you.
Shit
I can't.
You know what?
Now I want that even more.
What did you do?
What the fuck did you do?
The guy wants to fuck you
- I fucked him man!
No you didn't. He is still alive
He is still alive man
What's wrong?
What's wrong man? Get up

My mom has to go to dialysis at 11.
Don't you worry.
I take care of her.
Ciao.
Yes?
- It's me, where are you?
I am driving around. I am looking for him.
Did you check his home?
- No one there. He's gone.
Is it possible that I got
some diffrent information?
What information did you get then?
Are you lying to me?
Chill out, I'm gonna find him
- You are lying to me
Do you want to annoy me?
- Watch out how you talk to me
You should watch out how you talk to me
Don't fuck with me. You should
know who you're fucking with
Man, you want to threaten me?
You want to threaten me?

Friend? He screwed it up himself
- Shut up
This is my business, don't mess with it
And now fuck off
You know what? I don't give a shit about
you and your pussy of a friend
What? What's going on with you?
Come here now
Come here. Watch your language

Don't talk about him like this

Shut your fucking mouth

Peters, I am the ylilääkäri.
Want to take a seat? - No.
Your mother has suffered from
an acute kidney failure.
We also call it
a Rhabdomyolysis.
Because of her injuries toxic
substances entered her blood circulation,
and we were not able to clean them out
- What? Is she...?
I am sorry
We were not able to do anything anymore
Don't you want to sit down?
Could be better
Hey, man.
What's wrong man?
What?
What is wrong?
What man?
These motherfuckers...
- What?
Man, these motherfuckers, they...
- What did they do? What?
What did they do, man? What?
Your mother
Your mother.
No, man
No man. What?

Mann, Tibet! Stop it
You wanker. You killed her
You killed her
No.
What do you want in here?
No
Hey! Meryem?
Cunt
Thanks, Uncle Mehmet.
Look, Ayleen, who came: Daddy
Alles klar?
Forgive me.
See you.
Ey, Kollege! Ey!
Are you Chiko?
Why?
- You're Chiko, aren't you?
Who are you? - Are you Chiko
or not? - You're one of Brownie's.
What do you want?
- Put that thing down
What do you want? Hands on the steering wheel.
- We just wanted to buy some coke
Put the fucking gun down
OK, we've mistaken you for someone.
We thought you'd be Chiko
I am not Chiko
I am Isa
Hey, Ali. Where is Tibet?
I will take off to somewhere.
Are you coming with me?
