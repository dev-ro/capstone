India wins in the One Day international
against South Africa in Mumbai.
Heavy rains lash entire Tamil Nadu.
Cyclone has affected
normal life in many parts.
60 fisherman from Yaazhnagar
a fishing hamlet near Chennai
who went to sea fishing
are missing.
Since they haven't yet returned and
there's no information about them.
Fishermen in Yaazhnagar
are in fear and agitated.
Sir!
What happened?
Finished searching north side,
search operation is going in south side.
It's a week since they have
ventured into sea,
they should've been here
day before yesterday itself.
But not of them has returned, sir.
- You must find them.
- Please be patient.
Naval boats and helicopters
are searching for them.
Let's expect good news.
Okay, thank you.
Sir, all the boats have
docked in an island,
we've news that all the
fishermen are safe, sir.
What's the matter?
- All have returned except one.
- One? Who is it?
- Our Sura!
- Sura? What happened to him?
We got caught in high sea cyclone,
we lost the direction and
were getting drifted,
but Sura swam to find a safe island
and took all of us there.
When Coast Guards came to rescue us,
a boat capsized on the way back.
Coast guard saved us all.
But don't know what had
happened to Sura.
Why did you leave him behind?
Sir, we've rescued all
the missing fishermen.
Don't know what happened to him?
Sir, they need... Okay sir.
I'll definitely do it sir.
Come, let's inform Collector.
Are you all happy?
- No, sir.
- Why?
One man is still missing, sir.
- What are you saying?
- Yes.
Just one man?
Don't make it a big issue.
I've reported to CM about rescuing
all the missing fishermen.
I've given information on TV also.
Hush it up.
Sir, without him we are nothing.
We want him, order your men
to search for him.
You want them to enter sea again instead
of being happy for rescuing others.
Take it as this issue closed and
go back to your hamlet.
No sir, he's no angel to have
come from heaven,
he's also an ordinary man like us,
but he's equal to many mothers
in showering affection,
he's equal to hundred
elephants in strength,
he's equal to thousand lions
in bravery,
he's equal to hundred thousand
Machiavelli in intelligence.
We need him, sir.
- We want Sura!
- Wait, be patient.
Nobody knows here whether
he's alive or not.
But it's not food or medicine
that keeps a man alive,
it's well wishes of
good people like you,
that can keep a man
happy and alive.
A man who rules over
so many hearts,
death will not dare take
him away from you.
I'm sure he'll come back alive.
He's our boy, who swims against
the tide to win...
He's a winner always...
His heart is cool snow mountain
and deadly volcano...
He's the dawn in
we poor people's lives...
Hoist the flag of victory...
It's our sweep...
Future is all ours...
Lets' stay together like catamarans...
Nobody can win against us...
Let's stand together like
siblings of one mother...
Must become role models
to the future world...
The world which thinks
we are just match sticks...
Show them by friction
what you are...
Even crows have nests...
but poor don't have a hut too...
If you ask won't the wind tell the
tale of our every day struggle...
Even hamlets will have happy times...
if we hard working hands stay together...
Heart that lives for others
randomly thinks of self...
God has given me such a heart...
I'll seed myself in you...
I'll grow you in my heart...
I'm one of you only...
I'm giving myself to you,
take me...
Hoist the flag of victory...
It's our sweep...
Future is all ours...
Let's stay together like catamarans...
Nobody can win against us...
If you and me prosper,
our nation will be clean...
Who else is there other
than me to bell the cat?
If brave and courageous
follow me...
Let's pave a new path and
stamp out hypocrisy...
Let's question everything...
When cool, I'm gentle breeze...
When angry, I'm a storm...
I'm born lucky...
It's victory all my way...
Hoist the flag of victory...
It's our sweep...
Future is all ours...
Let's stay together like catamarans...
Nobody can win against us...
Yaazhnagar
Why are you cleaning fish, Sura?
My mother is not feeling well.
May I help you?
I'm free.
Free?
Can't you go silently?
- Sura, you come inside, son.
- Coming mother.
You're looking after him like
a mother rearing her chicks,
watch out, I'll take him
away from you.
Can I get you some chilly powder?
That's waste, sister,
grinding will add taste.
Grinding chutney or flour,
washing clothes is exercise.
It'll keep your body slim
like a movie star.
You use all ready made things
and watch TV soaps.
If there's not current you light
a candle to watch blank screen.
Your body will be like this only.
Like a flyover pillar.
Leave it sister.
Then my brothers-in-law and uncles
come to fight about your fat bodies.
Don't laugh, think over it.
Okay, I'll go.
Where's the match box?
Mother!
What?
What's this son?
Don't fast when you're ill,
eat only the you'll get energy.
Enough, son.
- Eat mother.
- Serve yourself, son.
I will, you eat first.
- Brother!
- What?
My husband hasn't gone
for over a month to sea.
I heard he wasn't feeling well.
He's lying, he's getting
drunk every day.
He's pawning things from home
to the usury money lender.
I'm doing odd jobs to earn and buy rice
from ration shop to feed my children.
He has pawned the ration card too.
Can't buy rice in ration shop
without the card.
I and my children haven't
eaten for two days.
Where is your husband?
He's in usury money lender's home.
- You have food here.
- No need, brother.
No problem, have food.
Come, join me.
- Don't you know to repay?
- Please don't beat me.
- When will you repay?
- I'll repay.
Brother... brother...
storm is coming...
- What are you saying?
- Tsunami is coming!
- What are you blabbering?
- Both are coming together.
Sura, they are beating me,
please save me.
You must save...
Have you pawned ration card too
along with vessels?
Are you human?
Is it just a card to buy rice
at subsidized rates?
It's an ID card that you're
a citizen of this country.
For how much he has
pawned ration card?
Rs.500. It's now Rs.1000
with 10 days interest.
What? Rs.500 interest
for 10 days for Rs.500.
You're unjustly too good.
Why are you keeping
so many photos of Gods?
Is it also pawned with you?
No, I'm very God fearing man.
To be in God's vision,
I've placed all around me.
You must see God always...
but what he says...
Tell me, brother.
Not me, you silly boy.
Great Annadurai!
He said see God in
poor man's smile.
You needn't see God in
poor man's smile,
don't see God of death
in their tears.
Parents sins must be
borne by their children.
Don't put the burden on your children.
Who said this, brother?
- This idea is mine!
- Okay brother.
Am I going to their home to lend
money with high interest?
They come seeking
and I'm lending.
Lending money is a profession but
don't charge unjustly high interest.
To warm up our home
don't burn other's house.
- How many cards are pawned?
- About 40 or 50.
You know its against law, don't you?
I know it's a crime and
I know how to handle it as well.
Inspector Dass!
- Sister! Filed the FIR?
- It's done.
Outside money lender,
inside a pimp. Good show!
Now I know how you're
managing law.
Please take bath and go to the station,
if not you may be reported as missing.
Teasing me? Don't forget you're
talking to a police man.
Aren't you ashamed to say that
in such a cheap place?
Stop it!
Why are you getting angry?
Instead of arresting a usury,
you're enjoying women in his bedroom.
Why should you get angry, tell me?
You'll work fearing higher officials,
you'll work fearing politicians,
you'll work fearing the
goons, mafia, murderers,
have you every worked for
any poor man like him?
Getting angry?
You needn't serve people,
just work for your salary.
How dare you taunt me!
Think as many times as possible
before you dare touch me.
Once you touch me,
then you'll not have time to think.
If you've courage,
dare touch me.
If I do...
You'll get a jolt!
No... please leave him, Sura.
I'll return all the ration cards
pawned with me.
Leave him.
O Goddess Nagamma!
I'm going to participate
in the boat race.
Bless me the strength to win
this race against all odds.
Bless me Goddess!
Why are you shouting like that?
- It's not shout but victory cry!
- Victory cry!
What's this weak beat?
Beat should be so fast,
it must break into pieces!
Play the fast beat!
Stop... stop...
Ladies and gentlemen...
How can they hear it you
hold the mike wrongly?
Sorry brother.
Ladies and gentlemen,
residents of this hamlet,
for the 18th boat race
taking today,
brother Umbrella is leaving
to participate,
we are very happy to announce it.
Not only that anyone giving him camphor
and garland welcome will be get Rs.50...
When did I promise to pay money?
Sorry brother, I said in a flow.
He has announced it publicly,
give as he says.
I don't have money.
Why are you worried about money?
I sold off the bangles from your house.
- Sold off bangles?
- You told me last night.
- I said it for fun.
- You said it, didn't you?
Play...
I'll take you to task after the function.
- Money...
- Pay him.
Put the garland.
Next!
Don't light fire to the paddle,
you silly woman.
Dance like that!
Stop... stop...
Brother Umbrella.
- Boat race is going on here, right?
- Yes.
Only my boat is here,
where the other boats?
- Brother!
- What?
- Then, you're unopposed.
- What's that?
No competitor is ready
to challenge you.
- Then, you've won unopposed.
- You'll get the cup.
- Have I won like that?
- Yes.
Where will I get the cup?
- From our referee.
- Where's he?
The man sleeping over there
is the referee.
Play music to wake him up.
Look, how he's sleeping without
giving me the cup!
- Stop... Referee!
- Stop it.
Get up! Get down.
Sleeping like a log!
All other competitors have
left the field fearing me,
then I'm the winner, right?
Instead of giving me the cup
you're sleeping like a pig.
- What did you ask?
- Give me the cup.
- Asking cup!
- Hold me!
- Why did you slap me now?
- What else then?
What was time was the
race will begin?
- By morning 6 am.
- It's evening 6 pm now.
Evening 6 pm?
Silly fellows!
Did I come at evening 6 pm?
Asking cup after the competition
is already over.
I was given grand reception
all the way to here.
That's why I got late.
Will you finish the competition
and give the cup?
When should you do this?
You should've done this while going back
after winning the competition.
Why did you do all this
while coming to participate?
Would I give you the cup?
You've been cheating me for 18 years
finishing the race before I come.
I'll not leave the place
without settling this matter.
For 18 years you've been torturing me
for cup coming late to the race.
Hereafter you mustn't
ever ask the cup.
What's this Sura, you're offering
prayers like in a temple?
Ayyanar or Jesus or Allah
are all my Gods!
Jesus will always be with you.
I want to tell you something, Father.
You've told me, right?
I'll take care of it.
- You don't worry.
- Greetings Father.
- Why are you here mother?
- Shut up son.
- Father, I wanted to bring him to you.
- Why?
- He's refusing to marry.
You advice him, Father. - Why?
Father, our hamlet may appear to have
many houses from a distance.
Only when you get near
you'll know it's all just huts.
For others rain will fall outside home
but for us inside too.
Rain water will flow
through our homes.
Spreading many diseases.
We've to take our children to some
school building for shelter like livestock.
We've to stand like beggars for
the food provided by the government.
Forget about summer, nobody knows when
and how our huts get gutted down.
But it's a regular feature like festival.
Isn't it, mother?
This is our life, Father.
To escape from this
precarious condition,
we need a good house that
will stand heat and rain.
I'll marry only after building
such a house.
Good! Every man needs a house.
Tell me how much you've,
I'll arrange for the balance.
You build a home.
If it was me only
I'd have done it long back,
I'm talking about 1400 families
in my hamlet.
Every father and mother in my village
consider me as their own son,
every brother and sister there
consider me as their sibling,
shouldn't I do something for them?
- I must do, Father.
- How?
I'm thinking about it.
Our people know to work hard but
don't know how to make money.
I must bring order in their lives.
Must build homes for them
at any cost, bye Father.
Did you hear him, Father?
We've to take loan to change
the thatched roof,
when will he build houses for them
and when will he marry?
He doesn't want to go from this world
without any achievement,
your son wants his life
to be meaningful.
Only one a million will think
about other's welfare.
But only one in 10 millions
will do it,
let's see what your son will do.
Didn't you see near sea for ten days?
I've danger in water,
so I tried to find another job.
- Did you get it?
- I did get... but refused it.
Why?
They are offering job
where I've to sweat.
How can I accept it?
You always say about
danger in water,
how about bath, drinking water
and other things?
That's different form this, right?
You've become a freeloader
without doing any work.
You can't say it openly,
you can say something like that.
Who is it?
- What?
- Hold the net.
Forget about net,
look at that statue.
She looks like a mermaid on shore.
- Mermaid has no legs just fins.
- What?
She's applying make up,
is she an actress?
- Yes, she's an actress.
- Actress?
- What's her name?
- K R Vijaya!
- K R... don't I know K R Vijaya?
- This is latest.
Latest?
You mean a remake?
He's staring at me.
The expensive scent is fragrant
in this lousy fish smell.
It's not fragrant to me.
You must have taste for it.
Why?
Normal humans will have taste
in tongue only.
Only fools taste with nose.
The girl is smiling at me!
Sura, she's coming towards us.
Not us, she's looking
at you only, Umbrella.
Looking at me?
Why is she coming towards me?
It seems fair girls like her go mad
on seeing dark guys like you.
Mad? What are you saying?
One important thing,
If she comes and says
I love you to me, and kisses me,
you mustn't get shattered
and sport a beard in sorrow.
He spat correctly into my hands.
I thought you came,
you've hundred...
Why did she come straight
and took a turn suddenly?
Am I not handsome?
He's turning to beat me.
Oh Sea mummy!
No! Oh Sea Mother!
Accept this destitute.
She's drowning herself to death
instead of saying I love you.
- Both are same, leave it.
- Don't take it as fun, save her life.
Only youth like me know
the value of a life.
I must mend the net.
You can mend it anytime,
but you must save a girl's life first.
You must save such beautiful
girls, go... go get her!
Hey girl! Hey girl!
- Stop!
- Leave me. I want to die.
- I can't live without my Ramesh.
- Love failure? Come... come...
No, please leave me.
I can't live without my Ramesh.
If you miss a Ramesh, you may get
Suresh, Dinesh or a Ganesh.
I can't change my heart like that.
I don't want this life without Ramesh.
Leave me.
He went into the sea with the girl.
He has come back.
Hey girl!
That's it!
He has done it.
What's this man?
Sand!
Is any exhibition going on here?
Call ambulance!
- Move... move... move...
- Who is it?
Ambulance is for males only.
For females, do first aid first.
First aid? How is it done?
People who drown in sea
would drink water.
So put your hands on stomach
and press... press... press...
If I press so much her intestines
may come out.
Tell me what next.
The water will come out
from mouth if you press.
Please press!
I'm feeling shy.
Don't feel shy off from duty!
Come on press.
- You're asking me to do it.
- Yes, dear.
Okay, elder's advice, I'll press...
- Excuse me.
- What?
My soul wants to help you in this job.
Can I also join you?
Okay, I'll cover the right area
and you cover the left area.
Thank you.
What were you planning to do?
We both were trying to press out
the water from your stomach...
Is it community well for you both?
Not like that...
Okay, you lie down,
they must do the first aid.
I'll beat you with slipper.
- She's sitting and you want
us to do first aid. - Rascal!
Why did you save my life?
You told me to save her, didn't you?
Do I need this insult?
Hey mister! Talk to me.
Did you her again?
Look, if you talk too much,
I'll drown you in sea myself.
Move... move...
Why a big crowd has gathered here?
- Who is this cartoon?
- Who is he?
Poornima! Why did you take
a hasty decision?
Your Ramesh has come back.
Has my Ramesh come back?
Where is he?
Is he Ramesh?
The boy is handsome.
It's justified to commit suicide
for losing such a man.
Bloody!
Where did you go away, my dear?
Why are you angry on me?
Dog and daddy have similar face.
Why are you feeling as if lost
husband and wife have united?
- Go man!
- Who is Ramesh?
The dog my daughter is fondling,
that's Ramesh.
- That boy next to her?
- He's my cousin Jimmy.
They've named Dog as Ramesh and
man as Jimmy, good family, right?
Good family.
Thanks.
I tried to kill myself
after losing Ramesh,
thanks once again for
saving my life. Bye.
Hello... hello...
That's fine, but why did you get down
from car and applied make up?
Anyway my body will wash
ashore after death,
then press and TV media
will take pictures,
my face will be dull
without make up, right?
That's why! Bye. See you.
That's a drab end.
Sir, the vehicles have left.
Sir!
Sir, Minister has left after the program.
Pack it with paper.
No, the goods will be ready.
- Greetings sir.
- Greetings sir.
Greetings.
Tell me brother.
- No problem, right?
- No.
- Have all the goods reached?
- Yes, brother.
What's the Seth saying?
He's here with cash.
You'll get the goods.
Yes sir.
- We'll go.
- Bye.
Ravi! Down the shutters!
All of you come here.
There's a man inside
other than our men.
That's not possible, brother.
- Yes, there is a man inside.
- Search. Do it fast.
- Who is he?
- Journalist.
Crime is crime even if you
open your third eye.
He has photographed it very well.
If we hadn't been careful,
it'll make tomorrow's headlines.
You would lose your Ministry too.
I appreciate your courage and
smartness to enter my den.
But your perfume helped me to
find a stranger inside my godown.
Good fragrance.
Neither I nor my men use perfumes.
Give the phone to him.
Take it.
Switch it on.
- Switch it on!
- Switch it on I say!
Record it.
Record it I say!
My name is Samudrarajan.
I was born to rule over the sea.
I'm an emperor in smuggling.
Politician is just a mask.
To protect myself I won by rigging
polls to become a Minister.
- We must be extra careful.
- Okay, brother.
One tea for me.
Didn't go for fishing today, Sura?
No, Srilankan Navy shot at
fishermen of Rameshwaram.
One of them died.
So as a protest Tamil Nadu fishermen
didn't venture into sea.
Picketing work.
You're picketing and
they are firing at us.
- It's never ending.
- Tea.
Tamils are the first to shed a tear for
anyone in distress anywhere in world.
But there's no one to
wipe his tears now.
When will this come to an end?
A day will dawn.
I've hope!
Buy pen sir... just Rs.5 only...
- Excuse me, re-charge please.
- Buy pen sir... just Rs.5 only...
Buy pen sir... just Rs.5 only...
What happened?
I can't walk any further.
- Get up.
- I can't. I'm hungry.
Two teas please.
Haven't eaten for two day now.
What can I do?
Unable to sell one pen also.
Not a penny in hand.
If I can sell a pen,
I can buy you a tea.
Please buy pen sir.
Pen sir... pen sir...
- Cancel the tea.
- Please buy pen sir. Pen sir...
- What's the price of a pen?
- Rs.5 each one sir.
Give me 20 pens, brother.
- Hubby... hubby...
- Please wait.
Take it sir.
- Take Rs.100.
- God bless you sir.
Thank you very much sir.
No need to thank me,
I'm like your younger brother.
- May I go now?
- Sir, one minute.
Is there any hotel nearby?
Hotel is opposite side.
Come, I'll take you there.
- Hi!
- Hello!
Hello! How come you're here?
- How is Ramesh doing?
- He's fine.
What has brought you here?
I stopped the car for phone re-charge.
I was watching you buying pens from him
and helping them cross the road.
That's alright,
but they would've been more happy if
you'd given money without buying pens.
They didn't beg though they didn't
have food for two days,
They were adamant to eat
only after selling the pens.
Why should I give Rs.100 and
make them beggars?
Please buy things from such people.
It will be helpful to them.
May I go now?
Okay, leave it.
- Take them away.
- Thanks sir. - Bye sir.
- Come children.
- Bye daddy.
- Bye daddy.
- Bye... bye.
I'll drop children in school
and visit the temple.
Be careful, tell the driver
to drive carefully.
When is the next consignment coming?
I've talked to Indonesians,
we'll get the stock by tonight.
Follow it.
Greetings sir.
My name is Suresh Reddy.
- My father, Rami Reddy.
- Greetings sir.
Please come in.
You're a big realtor all over India,
you've come to me?
What's the matter?
There's a fishing hamlet
Yaazhnagar nearby.
Yes, it's my area.
Actually, it's a private land, father bought it
from Subramanya Mudaliar in 1958.
Yes sir.
These are the land documents.
It was empty during the initial period.
Few fishermen put up huts later.
Now it has developed
into a hamlet.
We concentrated on our business
interests in Andhra Pradesh.
So, we didn't care about
this place.
Now we've decided to build
a theme park there like VGP.
Yes sir.
We can't vacate them and
reclaim the land.
It's very difficult.
Moreover if anyone goes to the court,
situation will get more complicated.
You know well, how many years
a civil case will take.
That's why we've come to you.
If you decide, you can vacate them.
Father!
It's Rs.50 millions.
If you vacate the hamlet,
we'll pay another Rs.50 millions.
Not for the money,
such big people have come to me,
I must do at least for that.
Give me little time, I'll do it.
- Bye sir.
- Okay. Bye.
Why are you coming so happily?
Am I happy? You feel I'm happy
with all these bandages.
Are you not happy then?
Forget it.
Wait! Won't you ask me
why am I with bandages?
Okay, why and what?
Better you don't ask it.
Stop!
- I'll ask now.
- Ask me.
Why are you hands and legs
bandaged and ring in the finger?
Where and how many beat
you for how long?
Great wish! Beat me always!
Tell me, I'm excited to hear.
How eager to get entertained!
I was watching a film,
I came out during interval
to smoke a cigarette,
I fell down to break my leg and hand.
Stop!
You fell outside the theatre
and got hurt so badly.
You're saying as if you fell
from the first floor.
Had I fallen from first floor I wouldn't
have got hurt so badly,
I fell from a running bus.
- I didn't get you.
- Didn't get me?
I was watching a film in a bus.
Only after falling down, I realised
I was the only one to come out.
I'm serious and you're laughing
like PS Veerappa.
Oh Ghost!
Who is that?
Same car...
same girl.
Same make up.
Hi! Hello!
Same U-turn.
Why is she coming quite often?
O Mother sea!
Please accept this destitute girl!
Same suicide!
She's committing the
same suicide again.
Sura, save her. Poor girl!
What are you searching?
- Stick! Why?
- Do I need to save her?
Already I'm badly hurt,
please don't beat me.
Last time when I saved her,
she asked me why did I save her?
Are you playing fun with me?
If you can't do it,
allow me to save her.
Go... go... save her... go.
I'll go but you may've to carry
two bodies, listen to me.
You can beat me anytime,
I'm giving you blanket permission.
But please save her first.
She's going to die... die...
Go!
You can beat me at any time,
I'm here only. Go... go...
Hello... hello... stop I say!
Please leave me... leave me...
I don't want to live.
Wait! Why?
Has Ramesh ditched you again?
- No.
- Then what?
I love a boy but don't know
if he loves me or not.
That's why.
Did you express your love to him?
Oh no! I forgot that.
Mad girl! Go and express
your love first to him.
If he refuses then you
can jump into the sea.
Then, I'll tell him right now.
Sura, I love you!
Did I say anything wrong?
Do you love someone else?
You're not making
any fun of me, right?
- You'd seen me twice, how can...
- How am I to tell?
You fit perfectly all the qualities
I expect in my husband.
You look like a little girl adamant
to buy an ice cream.
- You don't know my situation...
- I can understand.
You're rich, I'm a poor fisherman.
That's your problem, right?
What else?
Are you expecting any trouble
from my parents?
You needn't worry about my father,
he's just a dummy.
He'll never say no to me.
Look, that's not my problem.
You can't understand even if I tell.
Go!
Go I say!
Where did he go away with her?
Has he gone beyond the sea?
Can't make any guess?
Why have you come alone?
- I want to settle a deal with you.
- What's it?
I opened my heart to your friend.
Who asked you this now?
- Wait, why are you so excited, boy?
- Boy?
No:15, 9th cross street,
Raja Annamalaipuram.
What are you trying to say?
That's my house address.
Your friend must say I love you
to me by midnight today,
if I don't get that reply by midnight,
I'll do what I ought to after a minute.
What's that?
I'll not to the sea,
this is very far,
I'll commit suicide in my home.
Go ahead do it, it's better at home
than coming so far to torture us.
Why are you telling me this?
- I've a reason.
- What's that?
I'll leave a 16 page letter accusing
you for my suicide.
I'll beat you, he's responsible for your death,
why will you write my name?
He's very innocent.
You're the best man for such things.
Am I?
I asked him to save you,
now I'll myself drown you in sea.
Be careful.
You're talking too much.
It's your duty to bring him to me.
If not I'll go up and you'll go to jail.
16 page letter?
They take life for a half page.
She's threatening about
a 16 page letter.
Can my body bear it?
Trouble is coming in a car to the sea,
what am I to do now?
Why are they with dogs like
shepherds with sheep?
What's this?
Dogs and security people.
How can we enter?
Let's go back.
Did I struggle so much
to bring you for this?
If we go back,
that poor girl may die.
They may kill us before that happens.
Wait... wait... I'll take you
to the other side, trust me.
- Trusting you?
- Trust me. Come... go.
What's this?
You say come and then go.
Shall I come or go?
I told you to go that side... come.
Why? Go!
Look, how I put the ladder
like Pamban bridge.
Go up the ladder fast.
What's it?
What happened?
- I'm very proud of you.
- Why?
How much you're struggling
to save a girl's life?
Thank God, you've realised it now.
Go now.
Getting late to save her.
Go!
What? What's it now?
I'm very proud of you.
- To save a girl's life...
- Okay, you go in fast.
- Quick, just 5 more minutes only.
- Yes.
Go... go.
What's it now?
I'm very proud of you.
No need of all that, you go in first.
Go... go... go...
Go... go... go... go...
Remove the noose.
Don't interfere in my life.
You don't have life,
how can I interfere in it?
Hereafter I will trouble your life.
- Why did you beat me now?
- Look there!
Hi!
Hi?
You threatened about suicide
before midnight with Umbrella,
are you watching TV happily here?
Trust me, I've decided to
commit suicide.
Look, I'm prepared with make up too.
It's okay to keep rope, poison, knife,
and sleeping pills for suicide,
- what's that in the cup?
- Sugar!
I always have sugar before
taking any bitter tablet.
That's why...
Not only that I'm watching all the
scenes of suicide from various films.
What are you waiting for then?
Why not begin it?
Just now I called my friend
and I told her about this.
She said boys aren't like in olden times,
they have become very smart.
She said we must take little risk.
I too pondered over it.
If that's for ordinary man,
isn't it little difficult to make a super man
like you to fall in love, right?
So I cancelled the suicide program.
I was thinking about
my next attack.
That thing?
Poor Ramesh!
He can't live without me.
That's why same set up for him too.
A poor little dog...
Winged moon has joined
hands with me...
I gave myself to you at sight...
We want an earth
exclusive for us only...
Want love God to guard us...
Winged moon has joined
hands with me...
I gave myself to you at sight...
We want an earth
exclusive for us only...
Want love God to guard us...
It's your fragrance
all over my home...
It's your fragrance
all over my home...
With whose permission
did you enter my heart?
My love is after you...
My heart is in your lap...
You're a jasmine hot like sun...
You're cool like moon...
Winged moon has joined
hands with me...
I gave myself to you at sight...
My heart wishes to soar
beyond the sky...
My heart wishes to soar
beyond the sky...
I've started liking your
beautiful mistakes too...
My heart is jumping like a child...
It's throwing tantrums
making wild wishes...
Make a list of it, I'll give it...
All I wish is only you...
Winged moon has joined
hands with me...
I gave myself to you at sight...
You're a golden girl with
most beautiful smile...
You're the most handsome man
many women desire...
- Bye!
- Bye.
- Take care.
- Ta... Ta...
Ta... ta...
What?
Umbrella, who came with me,
where is he now?
What's that noise?
They say incident, right?
I think it's happening.
I'll take care of the incident,
you go to sleep. Bye.
- Beat him...
- Tell me...
How dare to use a ladder
to enter home?
Sir please know the reason
and then beat me.
Why did you enter, tell me?
- Brother, please don't beat him.
- Why are you here at this hour?
- Brother, he's our Umbrella.
- Our Umbrella!
What is he doing with
a ladder here?
We came here to paint last night,
we forgot and left it here.
Came to paint?
Painting isn't your profession, right?
- That's our side business.
- Yes
Okay, take your ladder
and leave the place.
If I see you again with ladder,
I'll thrash you. I'll finish you.
- Please come.
- Greetings sir.
- Greetings to all of you.
- Greetings sir.
Have sweets sir.
What's the matter?
You said the land deal is settled.
Celebrating it.
Please sit down.
You too have a sweet.
When will you vacate the hamlet?
How will you vacate it?
It's not a big deal to
vacate the hamlet.
- But there's a small problem.
- What's it?
When did your father bought that land?
1958!
But my father bought the
same land in 1948 itself!
You created fake documents for govt. Land
and paid me bribe to vacate the land.
Can't I create fake documents?
Have you gone dumb, Reddy?
No need to fight between us.
Let's share it equally.
50-50!
Reddy, I've a very bad habit.
If I don't like a thing,
I'll give it fully.
But if I like it, I'll have it fully.
I don't like sharing.
What's this sir?
We gave you sweet,
are you kicking us on back?
Samudram, you're doing a mistake.
I'll not leave it here.
I came to you because
this is your area.
I'll meet higher than you.
I know many Central Ministers.
I know all the goons.
Save me!
Water... water...
Bring it.
Water... water...
Water...
If I take that place, I know how you
can trouble me with your reach.
So I gave you coffee laced
with cyanide.
Big realtors from Andhra killed
in a car accident.
I'll build the theme park
dreamt by Reddy.
Reddy gave us millions of rupees.
We must clean up the hamlet
as soon as possible.
That's not a big deal.
They are all struggling for daily existence
fighting rough seas every day.
If we show them few thousands of bucks,
they will vacate the place.
It isn't as easy as that.
Why do you think so?
There's a man Sura in this hamlet.
Sura?
- People listen to him only.
- Is he the leader of the hamlet?
He doesn't claim himself as leader
but people see him as their leader.
Any one who is famous in his street wants
his name written all over the lane.
And as if they've found the cell phone,
keep flex banners with it all over.
But you say Sura is their leader,
I don't even know his name.
You can never see the roots
and foundation.
His name may not be on walls,
posters may not bear his name,
but everyone in this hamlet has
his image tattooed in their hearts.
You must be very careful
in handling him.
Instead of speaking individuals,
it's easy to speak with him only.
No, if he doesn't accept our deal,
as Reddy said if he goes to the court,
matter will reach people with
media pouncing on it.
Matter must be secret till the
land comes into our possession.
What are you thinking?
What if the house is locked
and we lose the keys?
What will you do enter the home?
Break open the lock.
Break it.
Umbrella! Our guy!
Oh God! I've had enough from her.
She has come to market for me.
Don't know what is she planning
for me now?
Why are you after me?
I asked a boy about Sura's house.
He said ask Umbrella.
- That's why...
- Stop it.
No need to ask me,
ask his mother.
- Where is his mother?
- She's selling fish there, ask her.
- Come and show me.
- Don't pull a man by his shirt.
Come and show me
who is his mother.
The lady sitting there is
his mother. Meet her.
She? Then say she's
my mother-in-law.
You're going overboard.
Love ghost has taken over you.
It's not good for your health.
I don't want to talk to you,
I'll talk with my mother-in-law.
Looks like she'll have two kids
before marriage,
and make her old granny.
I'll not let it happen.
- Mother-in-law!
- Mother-in-law?
Yes, she says mother-in-law.
She's like a golden doll and
is calling me as mother-in-law,
who is she?
Your son and she are dating.
What does it mean?
- She loves your son.
- Love?
- Not only that...
- Enough of it.
God bless you.
What's your name?
I'll kill you!
How dare you fall on me.
I'll make juice of you.
What had happened now?
Why is she here?
What is she saying with my mother?
Mother!
Mother! Mother!
- Mother...
- Mother-in-law!
- Mother!
- Mother-in-law!
Mother!
- Take mother to hospital.
- No son.
- Go... go... mother.
- Come, mother-in-law.
Who are you guys?
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
What happened? Who beat them?
Are you asking about that, doctor?
Two women! Huge in size!
They knocked down and
bashed me up.
Highlight is each woman weighs
more than 100 kgs.
What nonsense?
What is he blabbering?
Sorry doctor, that's his
personal matter, you go out.
I'll not go, I'll answer
his question.
Will you go out or shall I get you
a shot of poisonous injection?
Poisonous injection?
Out!
Will you kill me with a poison
injection for telling the truth?
- What a world this is!
- How is my mother?
Get lost! Irritating me!
Are you fine, mother?
I'm fine, son.
Are you okay, son?
Who are they?
What's the problem with them?
I too don't know mother.
May be they came for another man
and mistaken you for him...
I don't think so.
I felt they came for me only.
You wish good for everyone,
who is against you?
I never saw these
guys earlier, mother.
I wanted to catch one
and get information,
but all them just vanished.
Thank God, I was to
go to identify him.
What's our next plan, brother?
Next plan? He has sent all our henchmen
on retirement in one shot.
Now we've to advertise for
new henchmen to get thrashed.
- Settle their accounts.
- Okay.
Come... come...
take money and go home.
No use to fight him anymore.
He would've got alerted by now.
Now we must deal it
in a different way.
Bay of Bengal is my boundary...
I'm a lion cub...
I'll pounce, don't tease me...

Shall we play a game of dice?

Don't try to trap me...
don't look at me eagerly...
Okay, bye.
Throw him!
Pour and burn it down.
Huts are on fire! Come here!
My hut is burning!
Get water... douse the fire...
My house is burning! Sura!
Women leave the place,
we'll take care of it.
- It could be our Sura!
- No way!
- I'll not believe it, he's not Sura.
- By now he would've got charred.
Wait... wait... please be calm...
Constable, tell them to stand away.
Sir, we lost everything we had.
They used crackers for the festival
and it burnt down the huts, sir.
You never burn crackers carefully.
Did you see it's affect?
I'm getting choked.
What's this, Dhandapani?
We are on streets with
wife and kids, sir.
Sura was the only support we had.
We've lost him also to the fire.
- You must help us sir.
- Yes, you must.
What have you planned?
Few people can be accommodated
in schools or function halls,
all the huts are reduced to ashes,
thousands have been affected,
we are still discussing
about their rehabilitation.
Sir, rains will start in a day or two.
Situation will turn worse.
You must take immediate action.
Listen to me carefully.
I own 10 acres of land near Maruvathur.
I'll give it free of cost to you.
I'll give Rs.10000 to each family
to put a hut there.
I'll arrange your stay and food
for tonight in my marriage hall.
What's your opinion?
Discuss and take a decision.
Till now we had Sura and
we followed him,
Sura is no more with us,
we don't have any other way
than to listen to him.
Thank you very much sir.
May God bless you sir.
Why are you silent, Dhandapani?
Arrange for their stay.
Come... come quickly.
Come... come...
Come quickly.
Come fast with kid.
Those who have taken leave
the place quickly.
I'll not believe...
my son is not dead.
Killing the mighty who
torment the poor...
God who protects justice and law...
Killing the mighty who
torment the poor...
God who protects justice and law...
God who protects...
Standing by the destitute...
Our family deity who wipes our tears...
Standing by the destitute...
Our family deity who wipes our tears...
Our family deity...
Our family deity...
I was worried about you, son.
I'm fine, mother.
You said you killed him.
He has come like
Phoenix from the ashes.
That's what I'm also confused.
He's coming back from
death everytime.
Did you see our hamlet, Sura?
Where were you till now?
I'll tell you what had happened
to me or where was I?
Where are you all going?
Our hamlet is reduced to ashes,
Minister has generously given land
in Maruvathur next to Tindivanam,
and gave Rs.10000 to
build new huts.
What else do you know
other than fishing?
Will you come in a car from
Maruvathur to catch fish here?
He's adding fuel to the dying fire.
Okay, but what about the
homes to live?
Do you call what we lived
in as homes?
Were we living in palatial buildings with
separate rooms to cook, eat and sleep?
Can't even stretch fully
inside our huts?
Thatched roof, single brick wall
and one room only.
Can't we build it ourselves?
How could you leave the place you
were born and brought for Rs.10000?
Will you take money from anyone?
Tamils are the ones who talk most about
self-reliance and not follows it practically.
You were not here,
so we didn't have choice.
If I'm not here...
can't you live on your own?
You must live,
your life is your hands.
You must develop self-confidence.
Why are you still keeping money?
Return it.
What are you looking at?
Return their money.
Minister is calling you.
Greetings sir.
I heard you speaking to them.
You got emotional
while talking to them.
People who have lost everything,
I gave them money and land,
why are you stopping it?
If you'd given money and let us build
huts here, we would've accepted.
But you want us to
vacate this place.
I don't know what's your intention,
to help us or usurp this place?
Okay,
I gave Rs.10000 to all of them,
what are you expecting?
Rs. 100 thousands.
Rs.1 million!
Rs.10 millions!
I was having a suspicion,
now it's confirmed.
You burnt down our hamlet.
Yes, I did it.
I want this place.
What do you want?
You've burnt down an entire village,
and offering money too.
No man on earth can dare buy me.
Nobody will believe that
you burnt down the huts.
Even Police complaint is useless.
So I've decided to deal
the problem myself.
Do you know who you're taking on?
You're up against
an all powerful Minister.
You may have men, money, power
but I've honesty on my side.
I've the courage.
Above all I've followers
who would die for me.
Once I decide to fight,
I don't care if it's Minister or King.
I'll take on.
I'm throwing a challenge,
I'll build huts for my people
in the same place in 6 months,
this is not a challenge but a vow!
Tamil... courageous Tamil...
Leader of Tamils...
Will stand by the distressed
in times of distress...
He's like simmering fire...
will break the shackles of slavery...
If anyone dares steps on his shadow...
he'll strike cataclysm...
Hey customs! Escape!
You return fire at them!
They are firing from all sides, lie down.
He looks like a new officer.
They are using rocket launchers too.
- Don't give them time to recover.
- Okay, brother.
- Fire all bombs without any break.
- Okay brother.
They are using a sten gun too.
If we get caught they will make
us sing about the goods.
If goods is confiscated,
it'll reach port.
Minister will manage officers
and release the goods.
- Let's escape!
- Quick! Jump!
He'll raise like a volcano...
even enemies will praise him...
He'll attack like storm
and win the battle...
He'll win single handedly and
achieve eternal fame...
He's one of a kind this world
has seen and will see...
Tamil... courageous Tamil...
Leader of Tamils...
Will stand by the distressed
in times of distress...
Who went on rounds last night?
We didn't enter the sea at all, sir.
Who dared to confiscate my goods?
How can we dare confiscate your goods?
Trust me sir, we didn't do it.
It's not brinjals to sell everywhere,
it's laptops.
It has to come to me.
I'm sure the goods wouldn't
have left Chennai borders.
Mumbai
Let's check it sir.
Can we check it?
Okay.
You've changed completely.
Whose car is it?
You'll come to know it.
- Take chocolates.
- Thanks brother.
How is my dress, mother?
Very good, you look like a prince.
- I've a good news.
- What yeah?
- Super yeah! Give me hand.
- Thank you.
We are in for good times.
We'll be getting new homes shortly.
- Own homes?
- Yes.
A home that will not leak in rain
or get burnt in summer.
I'm losing out.
Who will build it for us?
Government?
No... no... we are building it ourselves.
- I didn't get you.
- Money?
- My mother gave.
- Me?
Mother, it's Mother sea,
who gives our livelihood.
It's a lie, that's my money.
Take out the vehicles.
- Stop... stop I say...
- Wait.
What's it dear?
Are you playing with ball?
Yes daddy.
Okay, go inside and play.
- Go... go...
- Come.
Come on boys!
All houses must be same.
He must be alive till money
comes into our hands.
When you challenged me on that day,
I thought you got emotional.
But you've proved that I was wrong.
No problem, return my money.
I'll forgive you.
Are you Jesus to forgive me?
I'll not return your money.
You've stolen my money,
is it justified?
Look, who is talking about justice!
Stealing from a thief for
necessity is not a crime.
What are you looking at?
You know this?
My dream is to build homes
for my people.
I was thinking about
how to achieve it.
God is the biggest maths teacher.
He added, subtracted and
gave the money to me.
I'll build homes for them now.
Okay, give me the money,
I'll build your homes.
You? Build homes for us?
You want me to believe this.
You're not a gentleman
to keep his word,
I'm not a salesman to
sell goods and pay you.
I'll not even give you a rupee
from the Rs.1 billion.
- Hey you stooge!
- It's me!
If your ship sinks in
the sea with goods,
what would you do?
What would we do?
We'll lament about losing the goods,
and go on a drinking binge
for 4 days.
Same thing... go on a drinking binge
for 4 days for losing your goods.
Go... go...
How dare you say that!
When leaders are talking,
sidekicks must keep quiet.
If you make any noise,
I'll cut your throats.
Take Rs.1 billion as compensation for
burning our huts and forget it, go now.
I've never spoken so patiently
with anyone.
If I get angry, I'll not speak.
My enemy will get beaten up.
If you beat, it may hurt,
but if I beat, it's strike of lightning.
I felt like crushing him under
a road roller when he was talking.
I can't harm him because he must be
alive till we get back our money.
Come.
If he beats you,
you can't sleep for six months...
He broke my hand, brother.
He'll beat black and blue
for nothing,
now he has millions,
he'll thrash you.
- We must protect ourselves.
- I'll go back to my place.
If he beats, you've to retire.
- Go... ticket is ready.
- Okay.
Today I've earned Rs.2000
selling the fish catch.
I'm very lucky today.
If usury lender see this,
he'll take it.
Better to hide it here.
Look there!
Why police is after me?
- You're under arrest.
- Arrest? I was just walking.
Though just walking, you came alone.
- Logic is wrong.
- Don't talk about logic.
What are you having?
- Watch, chain, ring...
- You've all this?
It's pawned with money lender.
Why are you talking to
him unnecessarily?
- Give me the baton.
- Take
- It has fallen down.
- Fallen down?
- Don't touch.
- Sir, it has money.
- How much?
- Rs.2000
- Where did you get it?
- My hard earned money.
Why did you hide hard earned money?
If cheats, robbers, thieves and
dacoits are everywhere,
how can I keep in pocket?
Meet sir and prove
it's your money and take it.
- This isn't good, I've to go home and
then go to fishing again. - Shut up!
Sir, he's the accused,
he's carrying good money.
But refusing to give valid reason.
You've been saying sir
but I don't see anyone.
Who are you talking to?
Why are you beating me now?
Why are you looking up?
Look down!
Why are you showing me
a 6 year old as sir?
A police man of this height?
I've never seen such
a police man in my life.
- Constable, up on the jeep.
- Sir is angry.
- Come here.
- What?
- What's your doubt?
- I suspect you.
We suspected and arrested you,
how dare you suspect us.
Stupid! Idiot!
How much did you seize from him?
Rs.2000 sir.
Are you suspecting police
for paltry Rs.2000?
Country fruit!
Come to station and prove
it's your money and take it.
It's my money.
Don't talk, I'll smack your face.
- Carry and put me on the seat.
- He's telling you, do it man.
He's telling you.
Let it be anyone, carry me.
Go quickly.
You took my money and asking me
to carry you, this is too much.
Put me in the jeep.
- An officer mustn't behave like this.
- Don't disturb me.
- Move man.
- Start the jeep. Take your hands off.
Sinners! They came swiftly
and took my money.
Did I get cheated...
The same green jeep is coming back.
Get down!
People will not believe even
if dons police role in a drama.
- He's a cheat.
- Cheat?
Have you given him money?
I did suspect sir, he was very short
and the jeep was green.
They are cheating because
of people like you.
That's why people and media
criticize police for inaction.
Tell me the truth,
how much did you pay him?
Are you asking that?
They took Rs.2000 from me.
Swear on your mother.
Swear on mother!
He's asking strangely.
I swear on my mother
I gave him Rs.2000.
He says Rs.2000 but
you said just Rs.130 only.
- He gave Rs.130 only sir.
- I'll kill you, idiot!
Speak only truth with
your senior officer.
Original police is coming, escape!
Original police?
Is he also fake?
Dharman isn't going
to fish without boat.
First houses and then buy boats
to those who don't have one.
Sura! Poornima hasn't come
home from college.
Her mobile too is switched off.
I'm scared.
Is her father crying about
missing daughter?
She's safe with me.
I must get back my money
in 10 minutes.
If not she'll face the wrath.
15 of my men are here,
they'll not let her go
even if she dies.
Tell me the place,
I'll come with money.
Got a call about bomb here,
it may go off at anytime.
It's a lie. Hoax call.
No sir, the man who called
was very confident.
All of you please go out.
- Please go out... I say go out.
- Go... you too go sir.
- Sir, it's in this room.
- Please go out sir.
What are you looking at?
With just a rupee I made a call
and saved my Rs.1 billion. Bye!
Sorry sir. We searched the place.
There's no bomb.
I told you it was a hoax call.
You never let me talk.
You sent away my guests,
my security.
What if people who left in
hurry took away anything?
Party fund was kept inside.
- Check the suitcase of that man.
- Hey you stop!
What's in the suitcase?
I'm asking you,
what's in the suitcase?
Nothing sir.
Why are you talking to him?
Open it and check.
The man looks suspicious,
let's use bomb squad to check it.
What's in the suitcase?
Bomb?
Money?
Hair!
- What's this?
- Fake hair!
Fake hair! You don't appear like
a fake hair seller.
It's all foreign hair.
It's imported, people buy only
when dressed like this.
It comes in ship on sea and
goes to Bombay to get polished,
and comes back to Chennai.
Very expensive.
Only rich like them can buy it.
That's why we came here.
But you scared us with a bomb.
- That girl?
- My assistant.
I'm selling ladies item,
so a lady assistant.
Uncle... sorry sir, if I come to your
home and if your wife tries it,
can I dare touch your wife's head?
Will you allow it?
That's why I've an assistant.
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Okay, take it and leave.
Bye sir.
Sorry sir, somebody made
a hoax call to trouble us.
Go away sir.
I've heard about thief getting
stung by scorpion,
I've seen it now.
Brother.
Wait... wait... why are you so furious?
Forget about taking money form me,
can't even take a strand of the fake hair too.
I'll build homes and
conduct house warming ceremony.
You'll come along with your gang
and enjoy our hospitality.
He's saying have good lick!
I like you.
I don't know what had
just happened,
why did they kidnap me?
But one thing is clear,
- my kidnappers are fools.
- Why?
If they had asked ransom
from my father, he would've paid.
You're already struggling
to make both ends meet.
How can they ask ransom from you?
You can give only fake hair, right?
Where were you all these days?
Your car, your costume
is rich and different.
How did you get all this?
I'll tell you later.
Okay... okay.
But one thing, I was scared of worse
ever since I got kidnapped.
You came like a storm and got me
released without a scratch.
Girls generally wish
for a hero like husband.
My man is a real hero.
Girl from Thanjavur come

Come whatsoever,
let's live for the community...
Stop!
Do we look so weak to you?
When did I say that?
Then what.
You used a ladder to steal but
I spared you because of Sura.
Are you going to steal with
a ladder in day time?
Sir, please don't think and
decide yourself.
If we keep a ladder,
are we thieves?
I'm going to dry fish.
Beat him!
- How many did you arrest?
- Two.
One of them is running away.
Hey look here.
He's an encounter case, take care of him
till we bring back the escape.
If you let him escape,
we'll encounter you.
Sir... sir... why are you leaving
him with me?
Oh God!
He's coming closer to me.
Why is he looking close at me?
Don't know what idea he's
getting on seeing me?
- Will you take care of me?
- I never said that.
They decided for me,
how am I responsible?
Why did you stare at me then?
It's the way I look when I'm scared,
you don't get scared of it.
Am I scared?
I've killed three people.
You know we've one thing
common between us?
What?
Your side locks and
mine are similar, right?
He's not getting diverted
for anything.
Follow me with that ladder.
Follow you?
What?
Throw away that ladder.
Throw away that ladder.
I would've thrown it there,
why are you telling after coming this far?
I've thrown it.
Order a tea for me.
Before that get me a glass of water.
One tea and a glass of water.
Take it.
Take water.
You eat food, right?
Of course!
My hands are cuffed,
why are you giving it to me?
Pour in my mouth.
That's it!
Have it.
Has it burned?
Okay... okay...
Cool down... cool down...
I'll do it patiently, don't get angry.
Getting down beautifully.
Enough.
Get me a cigarette.
Give me a cigarette.
What a great style!
- Light it!
- Light it?
Rope is here.
It's lighted.
How many odd jobs I've to
do to escape from him.
Take it out after each puff.
After each puff?
Won't you let out smoke from nose?
- Am I showing any trick?
- I'm caught!
Another puff.
Enough, it may burn
your moustache.
Put it down and
crush it under your feet.
Should I've to do it?
Your leg is free, can't you do it?
What else you want?
- I want to piss.
- For that?
Open the door.
Go lost! Try someone else for that.
Should I open it?
Will you open it or not?
Are you great if you kill 3 people?
I too planned to kill many people.
I couldn't that's why I'm here,
appearances are deceptive.
Open it? You troubled me a lot
and now this...
Where is he?
Where's the accused left with me?
We left him with you,
are you asking us about him?
He's careless about police,
how will care about a civilian like me?
Am I DSP?
- Where is he?
- He has escaped!
Escaped?
Where's the man you went after?
- He too escaped!
- Then I'll also escape!
Move... go... don't push...
move back... why are you pushing?
Don't know what's the problem?
Inspector has come to see you.
I've requested for transfer from
Coimbatore to meet you again.
- Get into the jeep.
- Why?
I've caught you red handed
while trying to sell drugs.
They have started it.
Give it to me.
They always use the same ploy.
This is the drug
I've confiscated from you.
Touching Sura and touching live
high tension wire is same.
If you've courage,
dare touch him.
Brother, just say yes,
we'll crush them.
Trying to create trouble with kids.
Hello, my boys are kids
but not paper tigers.
They are lion and panther cubs.
If I let loose them on you,
you'll be gone for good.
I've to take you form here,
if anyone stops me, I'll open fire.
You'll be responsible
for every death.
I'm here with shooting orders.
We'll sleep on the road as protest,
if you've guts take our Sura crushing us.
Come on boys!
Come... move...
All of you be calm.
We'll face such hurdles till we
finish building our homes.
Getting things done must be
our priority not bravados.
They can't take and hang me.
Be patient.
- What's this Sura?
- Nothing mother.
Give it.
Hello sir! I've arrested him.
I'm taking him to the station.
Don't take him to the station.
If matter gets leaked,
we'll be in trouble.
Take him to court directly and
send him to Puzhal jail.
Our boys are in jail,
they will treat him in their style.
When get into the their act,
he'll squeal about the money.
Okay sir.
The accused's name is Sura,
prisoner number 29,
father's name is Sekar,
resident of Yaazhnagar
is a drug dealer,
police have arrested him with drugs
while trying to sell drugs.
The confiscated drugs from him
is exhibited in the court.
So according to NDPTS act,
section 20,
I request the court to remand him
to 15 days judicial custody.
That's all your honour.
I've sent him to jail,
he can't escape from me now.
Is your name Sura?
Not answering a question
is insulting the court.
They have charged you with
possession of drugs,
if the charge is false,
you can deny it.
Why is he silent?
Why can't he deny the charges?
That's what I'm also confused.
Taking his silence as accepting the charges,
I'm sending him to 15 days...
Greetings your honour!
Why were you silent till now?
Sir, my father taught me that law is
a darkroom while I was a kid.
If I'm casual even law will
get punished.
He always tell me to be sharp
while attending courts.
Why were you silent till now?
Till now I was sharpening
my weapon... sorry my brain.
Public prosecutor told this court
what had not happened.
I'll tell now what had happened
to this court.
You tell what will happen in future.
Am I right?
Sir, I've already met this Inspector.
I may've forgotten it, I'm sure he
wouldn't have forgotten it.
When I was in my hamlet,
sir came in a jeep.
He gave this packet of drugs
and asked me to sell it.
Accused is lying, your honour.
He's up to something.
He has checkmated us.
Did I object when PP was
charging against me?
- Let me finish my arguments, sir.
- Carry on.
I was shaken and taken aback
when he made this request.
A rogue, a cheat can sell drugs.
I cried like hell saying how can
a police man sell drugs.
He said for that...
There are many honest officers
in my department,
but for me when it comes
to money,
I'll sell drugs or even my wife too,
he said so, sir.
Objection your honour.
Mister! Don't use abusive
language in court.
Sir, I just repeated what he said.
Okay, leave it.
I'll come straight to the point.
When he said that, I said this
good policy may good for you,
but it's not good for people
like me with one father.
Immediately he got angry, sir.
My name is Dass,
law & order is dust of my feet,
if you don't sell this drug for me,
I'll foist cases on you.
He said so, sir.
What exactly you're trying to tell?
Sir, Inspector gave me the
drugs to sell it for him.
Objection your honour.
Prosecution will not accept baseless
charges against a Police officer.
If you raid a house now,
you can confiscate drugs.
No, your honour, he's trying to divert
court's attention with false accusations.
There's no provision in law to raid a
police officer's house taking your word.
Can police foist drug case
on anyone they like?
Is there a provision for it
in your law?
Tell me sir, you're sending me
to 15 days remand in jail.
What will you do after 15 days
if I'm proved innocent?
We'll release you.
What your law says for remanding me in jail
for 15 days without committing any crime?
If I'm out of jail, I'll not get work,
I may not able to marry,
in fact this society will consider
me an outcast.
What will your law say for this?
Will you paste posters in town that
I'm innocent and was falsely charged.
Sorry.
Tell me sir.
I'm asking the court that says
1000 criminals can escape
but one innocent mustn't
be punished,
please give me an opportunity
to prove my innocence, sir.
I'm not seeking adjournments
to prolong the case.
I'm seeking an opportunity
to prove my innocence.
Okay, this court orders to raid
Inspector Dass's home.
He confused the court.
He has planted something
in Inspector's house.
He can't do it sir, he's in court
since he was arrested.
How can he do it?
He's a magician! He can be in court
as well as in Inspector's home.
You go and find Inspector's house and
clear off any drugs planted there.
- Go immediately.
- Come... come...
Brother, they've left the court just now,
I'll clear off everything from there.
What is this?
- Hey!
- Who is it?
Why are you driving a boat on road?
On the road?
It was in sea,
how did it reach the shore?
How do we appear to you?
If I come up I'll break your waist
and that paddle.
Move the boat aside.
Is it cycle to move aside?
A boat is like an elephant.
I need few men to move it.
Don't waste my time with
your useless talk.
Are you working?
He's planning for something else.
Reverse the vehicles.
Traffic jam behind us, brother.
You mustn't enter the home, stay here.
You search the place.
Sir, I...
Come in... why have you
all come together?
Hasn't he come?
- Please sit there.
- Why?
Please sit there.
Search!
Why have they come?
What's happening here?
Sir, he's beating me.
Sir, we found drugs.
Drugs?!
In my home?
Who would've kept it here?
May be it was him!
I've opened a new provision stores,
I heard sir must get his cut first
from any business in this area.
So, I've brought a month's ration.
Please accept it.
You keep everything inside and go,
I must cook.
You cook for him, I'll book him.
What a smell!
Trust me sir, I'm innocent.
I'm not connected with this.
He has planned something...
Whatever it is, say it in court.
Hand cuff him.
Sir, no hand cuffs.
Remove his hand cuffs
and arrest him.
This court releases Sura as innocent.
Hello uncle! Is the game getting hot?
Want to know what game?
Not any game but game of cards!
Your man is in and I'm out.
I'm not a prawn to get caught
in your net, I'm a Shark...
I'll swallow both the net
and the fisherman.
Don't expect me to show another
cheek if you slap on one.
I'll slap your both cheeks.
I haven't seen anyone like him in my 15 years
of goon and 10 years of political life.
He's playing with my life.
If I take weapon, he's a warrior,
if I use brain,
he's like a Machiavelli.
Overall he's a Satan to you.
- What's that?
- Brother...
I'll not spare him...
I don't mind losing that place too.
I'll not let him build homes there.
Marudhamalai... Lord Muruga!
Lord Muruga of Marudhamalai...
Lord who protects the clan of Devars...
Lord Muruga of Marudhamalai...
Lord who protects the clan of Devars...
Lord Muruga of Marudhamalai...
Fragrant sandalwood paste...
beautiful vermilion...
Fragrant sandalwood paste...
beautiful vermilion...
Lord as we approach you...
Though rich with wealth,
don't forget this poor man...
Snow, mountain, rain, river, sea...
everything is your mercy...
Snow, mountain, rain, river, sea...
everything is your mercy...
Snow, mountain, rain, river, sea...
everything is your mercy...
Come... Lord Muruga... Lord...
Why did you throw the pot on me?
Who let you inside?
Teasing me and creating trouble here.
I'll strip you of your dhoti.
When I'm talking to you,
why are you after my dhoti?
You'll bleed yourself to death,
listen to me.
Calm down!
Bhagavathar! You sang very well
for the first time.
Why are you attacking him?
Asking me why?
This rogue is making
gestures that I'll die.
Then he says you.
What's the meaning of it?
Are you a temple administrator?
He says I'll die with heart attack
if I sing breathlessly.
A rouge can become a singer,
a singer becoming goon isn't good.
I'll become a goon.
- Watch out now.
- Why are you picking it up?
- If I hit you with this.
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Give the phone to collector.
- Sir, Minister is on line.
- Do it fast.
- I'll clear it in an hour.
Okay sir... okay sir.
I'll come back after clearing
everything in this hamlet. Right sir.
Did you see them coming like
an army attacking enemy nation?
They are going to raze down
our homes.
Collector says to leave the place.
- What's all this?
- Who are you?
One amongst us.
One who stands for us.
One who will talk with you for us.
I'm giving you just 10 minutes,
leave the place with your men.
Why?
This place belongs to government.
Don't these people belong
to government?
Have they come from any
other country illegally?
We give life to refuge seekers,
why are you chasing we Tamils
like dogs in our homeland?
For that will you occupy
government land,
and we should keep quiet?
We didn't occupy this place,
we've been living here for generations.
My father was born here,
I was born here,
my son will also be born here only.
We are not asking you
to build our homes.
Just give us ownership documents.
We'll take care of the rest.
Are we asking any apartment
in Annanagar?
Seeking any bungalow
in Poes Garden?
Useless salty sand.
If you throw us out from here also,
where can we go?
If you can't give ownership documents
and want us to vacate this place,
kill us all and take this place.
All of you sit down.
- Give the phone to Collector.
- Sir Minister on line.
Let him be, you heard him, right?
He has moved my soul.
I don't know how to answer him.
- Sir, let police do...
- Did you see him?
He's sitting cool like a volcano
ready to erupt at anytime.
I think with a gesture he can
make the sea burn.
- What should I do now?
- Sir is tensed.
- Give it to him.
- Minister is on line.
Switch off the phone.
Switch it off I say.
Your anger and
your request is justified,
to give you ownership documents,
what's the proof you were living here?
We lost everything in fire.
We don't have any evidence.
I'm helpless then.
We've evidence, sir.
What's it Sura?
Father, I need to talk to you.
All are my village's ration cards.
People in village are
pawning cards to booze.
That's why I brought all cards here.
Give to women only to buy
food grains and kerosene.
And take it back.
This will help us greatly, Father.
I gave it to him for some other reason,
so we could save it.
Isn't this enough?
Enough.
Inform revenue department and arrange
for their land documents.
- Sir.
- Okay?
Okay sir.
- Thank you very much sir.
- No need.
You've done it, Sura!
- I'm proud of you son.
- We've won!

What happened?
If this bomb goes off, everything within
a kilometre will get razed to dust.
Can't identify even the body?
Complete program of the bomb
is fed into this computer.
We can switch on
or off from here only.
Entire hamlet will gather in one place
by tomorrow morning at 9 am.
They are celebrating house warming
ceremony unitedly in one home.
Everyone must be dead before
house warming ceremony is over.
Raise the festoon.
Further high!
Why corporation lorry is here?
You're conducting house
warming ceremony, aren't you?
Corporation has sent it
to clean the area.
That's why.
Go backside,
lot of trash, clean it.
Do it. Come, we too have lot to do.
Start the boat quickly!
Go fast!
What did you say? Will you swallow the
net and the fisherman too?
The land I wanted to usurp and
my Rs.1 billion worth goods,
I've lost it and yet left you alive.
I would've buried you
in water itself.
But you would've died happily for fulfilling
the vow of building homes for your people.
No, I'll not let you die peacefully.
Look there!
In few minutes,
you'll see thick cloud of smoke!
It's not smoke but your aim,
your wish, your dream.
You must cry seeing all your efforts
being razed to dust.
In 10 minutes bomb will go off.
Nobody will remain even
to mourn the dead.
Agreed there won't be anyone
to mourn the dead,
but you will be there to mourn the
death of your wife and children.
What are you saying?
Your wife is the chief guest
in the function.
What are you saying?
Not only your wife is there,
your children too are there only.
The bomb you've planted isn't
just for the hamlet,
you've planted it for
your own family too.
No... no way... my wife will
never go to such places.
- Hello...
- Hello!
- Where are you?
- Yaazhnagar!
Who told you to go there?
Why are you asking like that?
Elections are coming.
This hamlet has good many votes.
You were out of station for a week.
- Hello...
- Can you hear me?
Hello!
Hello... hello... hello!
Brother, bomb will blast off
in just 5 minutes.
Do it fast, switch it off.
Go fast!
I must save my wife and
children, go fast!
- Barge has drifted away.
- Jump on to it.
What are you waiting for?
Jump quickly.
Quick!
You saved your hamlet hiding
behind my wife and kids.
I'll destroy your hamlet
at any cost.
I'll kill you before that.
Pull the anchor! Fast!
Hoist the flag of victory...
It's our sweep...
Future is all ours...
Lets stay together like catamarans...
Nobody can win against us...
Let's stand together like
siblings of one mother...
Must become role models
to the future world...
The world which thinks
we are just match sticks...
Show them by friction
what you are...
