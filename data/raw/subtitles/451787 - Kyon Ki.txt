Good morning, Doctor.
Here, take this rotten
uniform back.
A shroud is perhaps better.
By God, just coming
out of the ward..
...was enough for me to get well.
Cursed place!
Don't say that. Number
36 is very lucky.
Good luck my foot!
Wear it once and see.
It can drive even a
sane person insane.
So, is everything going
on well after we left?
Or does the same drama continue?
Everything will be alright.
They all must be just
loitering around.
Listen, Ma, everything
will be alright.
No hOpe!
Let me reach home. Once there..
...just see how I set
everything right.
Everything will be alright.
Let's go.
Why are you standing
like a moron? Move.
Listen, I have packed all your
medicines in your luggage.
Don't forget to take them.
To hell with your medicines.
C'mon, move.
Take the luggage along.
Open the door.
Come.
Worthless woman!
You took so good care of her.
You served her as if she
was your own mother.
And she didn't even
bid you a good bye.
Such bad times!
You miserly old hag!
Didn't shell out even
a single rupee.
I am dead sure you'll
return fully insane.
You'll stay with me so long
as I live, won't you?
You calls her a daughter
and yet questions her.
I don't have a mother,
you are the only one.
Here.
Dr. Khurana hasn't come yet but..
...I was asked to meet you.
Anand Sharma case, right?
Yes, I am Deepak Sharma!
I am his elder brother.
These are the legal papers.
Will you admit him immediately?
No, mental patients
have to go through..
...a special procedure before
getting admitted.
Until our doctors aren't sure..
...a patient cannot be admitted.
Okay, as you wish.
Mr. Anand, the court
and your family..
...have concluded that
you are insane.
What do you have to say about it?
If I declare that
I am not insane..
...you'll say that all insane
people say the same.
And I have been charged
with murder.
If I tell you that I
am not a murderer..
...you'll say that all
criminals say so.
What do you think about
the design on this card?
What is there in it?
See it properly and tell
me if you can see..
Flowers and butterflies
and clouds in it.
I'll surely answer this question.
But tell me something,
whoever comes here..
...do you ask them such
stupid questions..
...and make them insane?
Sorry, we cannot admit Mr. Anand..
...as he is mental
condition is okay.
Doctor, please don't
take hasty decisions.
Anand has been convicted
of murder.
And the government doctors
have declared him insane.
And courts cannot convict
an insane man.
Sol brought him here.
I understand what you are saying..
...but our tests prove him normal.
She was playing with me.
She was playing with me..
...this fly was playing with me.
I am sorry. What conclusion
have you come to?
Am I insane or not?
Admit him.
You aren't ready yet?
Today I am not feeling well.
I am on two days leave.
Did you apply for leave?
- Yes.
I don't know. I check the record.
Your work has been done.
- Okay.
I have spoken to Tendulkar.
These days Saurav Ganguly
isn't playing well.
If his performance isn't up
to the mark we'll admit..
...him here and you can become
the captain instead of him.
Thank you sir.
- But don't reveal it to anyone.
Sunil, did you get flowers for me?
Of course, do I ever forget it?
You are holding the
book upside down.
My name is Anand.
Greetings, baldy.
Hey badly, do return my greetings.
Hey, why are you staring at me?
Hey, baldy.
Okay, don't talk if
you don't wish to.
I don't wish to talk
to you either.
Why did you break the signal?
I apologize, sir.
Please let me go.
No, show me your license.
- No.
Do you want to go to jail?
- No.
Then show me your license.
Okay, you may 90-
Where is, Agra?
- Agra? - Agra.
Take a right from here and turn
three more rights. - Okay.
Be careful.
What are you doing?
I am ringing the bell
to call the God.
But where is the bell?
There isn't the God too.
Hey, shut-up!
They are playing the cards.
Grandpa, are you Chinese? - No.
Are you Chinese?
- No.
Are you Chinese?
- Yes I am.
But you don't look like one.
- What?
Hey Buddy, can I play
cards here too?
This is a club of the rich.
Do you have money?
Tell him about my status.
I have a chocolate factory.
Trees laden with sweets.
A Mango juice factory.
That's nothing. I just bought
the Taj Mahal from Agra.
But when did I sell it to you?
Okay, then this deal is canceled
- Hey, be quiet.
What do you have?
My mother.
Why didn't you tell us before?
Sit down. Hey, let him play too.
If he plays, then we'll
need one more person.
Call that baldy.
What can he play?
He neither speaks nor moves. Just
sits there like a vegetable.
Give me this flower.
She is not a flower.
Her name is Gulabo.
Bow you your head and greet her.
God bless you.
Let's Play-
Medication time.
The medicines are ready.
Everybody stand in a queue.
C'mon buck up, didn't you
hear the announcement?
C'mon..
C'mon Swami, take your
medication. - 'Shanti'.
Shanti is washing that bathroom.
Go to take your medicine.
Why am I being given medicine
when I am just a soul?
You'll forget everything if
I hit you once. - C'mon..
33. Here.
34. 35.
36
What is your name?
My name is Anand and my
friends call me so.
Here take this.
Is it bitter?
It will be bitter today but
you'll get used to it.
Okay, then I'll eat it later.
You won't listen, will you?
Narayan, Anthony.
Are they going to have it too?
They'll push tablets
down your throat.
Okay, then I'll do it myself.
37
You had to eat it after all!
I do as I say.
Come out.
What is all this in spite
of my objecting to it?
Sir..
- Shut up.
The work schedules of everyone
in this hospital..
...will be decided according
to my rules.
Those who don't abide by those
rules will be fired.
Throw sister Jenisa
from this hospital.
Listen to me..
...don't let her come back.
Day or night, discipline
will rule here.
This place isn't a
garden to saunter
No matter how much she pleads..
...I won't let her come back.
Even if she does return,
I won't let live in peace.
She's rude and very outspoken
I swear by my heart..
...she doesn't exist
for me any more.
I don't care whether
she lives or dies..
She doesn't exist for me.
Are you new here?
- Yes Sir.
Then why are you smiling?
Hey, don't try to
act smart with him.
Who is he?
Colonel Khurana. He's from
the army, very strict.
Is he a constable?
- What?
Is he a constable?
- Yes.
Name is Anand Sharma. He seem
to come from a rich family.
His parents are dead.
There's an elder brother and
sisters who live in America.
His brother cares for
him so much that..
...he got a special permit
from the court..
...to get him admitted
in a private clinic.
And so he brought him here
and gave a blank cheque.
What is the name of
Aanand's father?
Retired Judge Jagannath Sharma.
Congrats Sunil, you are
first in the whole city.
Very good.
I am proud of your success.
Sir, it is all due
to your blessings.
No, I haven't done anything.
Your parents have been working
for us for ages.
But you've earned this position
with hard work and dedication.
God bless you.
Son, give this to
your brother Sunil.
Why are you giving so much money?
Because it has helped
your brother..
...to become a doctor.
And when you are sick,
he'll take care of you.
Sunil, what are you thinking?
Nothing.
Sir.
Hey, come here.
Look up. Not there, look
down here. Look at me.
I knew just at your sight seeing
you, that you are a brat.
Listen carefully.
If any of the patients
don't follow my rules..
...then I behave very
strictly with them.
I set such cases right in a trice.
Don't ever give me
that opportunity.
Did you get that?
You may go now.
Can I do it again? Please.
Anand.
Did you recognize me?
N OW?
Which place I meet with you?
We just met at the
constable's office.
Can I go?
- Yes.
You are not supposed
to play with it.
Who are you?
- Doctor.
You are supposed to consume it.
- Why don't you do it?
Shut your mouth and
swallow the medicine.
How will I swallow it
if I shut my mouth!?
Didn't I ask you to eat it?
Are you listening?
'Didn't I ask you to eat it?
This medicine.. That
medicine. Huh!'
This way, then like this
and then like this!
Everyone ready?
1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6..
Seven.. Eight..
1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6..
Seven.. Eight..
Very good. Ok, change! One.. two..
You push me, idiot!
What happening here. Get up.
Do you own this garden? You
don't stand up properly.
I will curse your mother. Don't
use your useless brain.
Stand properly.
- Peace! Peace!
To hell with peace.
Stand straight.
Next change.. one..
Hey, come here. Stand properly.
Can't you stand properly.
Stop.
It's not his but someone
else's fault.
And he is acting so innocent..
...as if he hasn't done a thing.
You.. number 36. Come here.
You don't like exercising, right?
Fine, don't exercise.
Come with me.
Bhagat
- Yes, ma'am.
Clean the other room.
- Ok.
You don't like exercising, right?
Here, take this and clean
this entire room.
And yes, the room should
be spotless..
...before I visit here again.
Ok?
Where is the breakfast?
My God! What is he doing?
What are you doing?
Someone help me.
Hey, come here.
What are doing?
- Tidying up the place.
Who asked you?
Are you tidying up the place
or making a mess of it?
I had a broom which
collided with..
...this and it all
started from there.
And then he came from
there and then..
Bring him to the 'Shock Room.'
Look here, a fly.
A fly!
A fly.
Come, lie down on this.
Why do you seem to be so
sad and upset these days?
Nothing of the sort.
I am not only your father
but also a psychiatrist.
Why hide it from me?
I know that you are quite upset
because of Mrs. Shobhna's..
...departure without any
prior information.
And the troubling aspect of
it is that you served her..
...as if she was your mother.
So many times I have asked you..
...not to get too attached
to patients.
Ok, listen now. With great
difficulty I have managed..
...the forms for your UK visit.
We are already late. Hence I'd
like you to sign and send..
...these papers tomorrow
without fail.
Otherwise your admission won't
be possible this year.
One more sound from
you will mean ..
...your detention, Michael.
Stay quiet.
Why are you crying, Michael?
Did your car break down?
Because Rosy has gone.
- So what? Call her.
Cannot. She has gone to God.
It's three years now.
It's her anniversary today and..
...all I need is a candle
to offer my prayers.
But they are saying that
they have no candles.
I will get one for you.
I need a candle.
You find this light insufficient?
Why do you need a candle?
To offer prayers to the Lord!
Tell your lord that this lord
has refused. C'mon, get lost.
I need a candle means
I need a candle.
Hey, one tight rap and you will
land at the lord's doors.
Get lost!
C'mon, get gOil'l9
Hey, pay attention.
Play your card.
I will be back.
What do you want?
- Take off your clothes.
What? - It will take
just fifteen minutes.
What do you mean?
All you have to do is remove
your clothes and lie down.
I am not that sort of a man.
No, you are mistaken.
You have to just..
...give me your uniform
for 15 minutes.
I will go outside and come back.
You have to just lie down
covered in a blanket.
You want to buy me
over in 20 bucks?
Am I a burger or something?
My hide will peel off but
not this uniform, got it?
What do you take me to be?
Another misadventure and
I will break your bones.
Got it? Never repeat this again.
Will you be back soon?
Within 15 minutes?
My job is at stake. Come.
Turn the car back to the
hospital. Immediately.
Have you spotted patient No.
36 somewhere here? - Why?
I am asking you something. Just
give me an answer. - No, sir.
Ok, let's go to the hospital.
Security come with me. - Yes sir.
Where is No. 36?
- Sir.. he..
I said, where is No. 36?
Sir, he was here.
- I know he isn't here.
Come with me.
Where were you?
- Inside.
It's my 36th trip inside.
Are you the cook here?
God saved me.
So you had gone to take
candles for Michael?
Why? - Because Michael is a nice
chap. He is fat, isn't he?
He couldn't possibly go running
to the town to get candles.
What's this?
- Style!
Shall I too follow it?
Very thoughtful!
But you would have been in a
big soup had you been caught.
Will you inform the security?
- No.
But don't forget while trying
to do good to one person..
...you might end up putting
everyone in trouble.
Don't repeat it again, ok?
Yes.
Brother!
Brother Sunil.
You will save me again, won't you?
No? Ok.
Speak up, from where did
you get the candles?
Don't you hear? Speak up fast.
You nut! Did the candle fly
to you from the grave?
Speak up. Gone deaf?
Who brought the candle inside?
Speak up, c'mon.
Speak up, who brought
the candle here?
So no one knows who brought
the candles inside, right?
Narayan, take the candles inside.
No! I won't give the candles.
To offer prayers to the Lord! -
Narayan. Take the candles inside.
No! I won't give the candles.
To offer prayers to the Lord!
To offer prayers to the Lord!
Don't hit him.
Don't.
Stop! Don't hit him.
I need a candle.
- Here, take this.
Hey, stop it.
- Stop it I said.
Bring him to the 'Shock Room'.
- Yes sir.
Brother.. Sunil! No.. Shock no.
Brother.. Sunil!
Sunil! Brother!
- Let go of him.
But Dr. Khurana..
- No, just let go of him.
But this is Dr. Khurana's order.
- So what? Get lost.
Why are we here?
Because I didn't want to create
a scene at the hospital.
I feel, you have started to
develop a notion that..
...I don't know how
to treat patients.
Why do you say that?
Nothing of the sort.
Then why did you go
against my orders?
Why did you take Anand away
from the Shock Room?
Why so much sympathy
towards a killer?
There is a small story..
...that is in my life.
This son of a maid at Anand's
house has become a doctor today.
This patient Anand was
the one who helped me..
...financially to complete
my education.
We never had an employer-servant
relation between us.
We were rather like bum chums.
He was like my younger brother.
And he used to address
me as brother Sunil.
I got emotionally carried away..
...upon hearing it after
so many years.
I am sorry, sir. This
won't happen again.
Today's counseling session
is coming to an end.
Does anyone want to
ask or say something?
Madam, why are these
speakers here?
So that our voice reaches you.
Then play some music on them.
Good idea!
We can't play music just
because you want it.
There are 26 others in your ward.
None of them ever asked for it.
But they never objected
to it either.
Just try setting up a tape
recorder or a radio here?
It will be great. Music can do
wonders. Isn't it Swami-ji?
Music is like an ocean but
the fish in it are crying.
What? - Because we catch those
fish, fry them well..
...and devour them. That
is why the fish cry.
And the water of the ocean
becomes salty with their tears.
Music is life. What do you say,
Abdul? Isn't it, Michael?
Yes, but what is life all about?
Don't you know that?
Everyone knows what
life is all about.
Do you have a life?
- No, it's finished.
What is life?
- Gandhiji.
What is life? - I don't know.
I am new to this place.
I'll tell you what
life is. Life is..
If you don't know what life
is why should I explain?
Then explain me, what is life?
- Shut up.
If there is a majority..
...I mean if at least 13
of you raise your hands..
...then we can consider giving
you the permission.
How many of you want music?
Raise your hands.
Is it okay?
- No, we need 9 more hands.
Won't fingers do?
- No!
We need 9 more hands.
This is cheating.
One man, one hand.
And we only have two minutes.
Raise your hands.. Swami-ji..
Swami-ji, where is
the temple bell?
Will this do?
No. - It will do but we still
need eight more hands.
A thief came and stole!
The police arrived and nabbed him!
Will this do?
- Seven more.
That's okay.
Raise your hands.
All those who are rich shall
raise their hands.
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.
Aren't there even seven rich men
in a population of 70 million?
Five.. five!
Two more!
Michael.. Michael..
Why don't you raise your hand?
All of us will enjoy music.
Michael, didn't I get
a candle for you?
Now raise your hand for my sake.
Won't you raise your hand for me?
Won't you? I stole
a candle for you..
...all these people
thrashed me badly..
...but now you are not
going to support me?
It is rightly said..
...that one shouldn't trust madmen.
L.. Michael..
Michael, tell everyone
where your Rosy is..
Tell everyone where Rosy is.
Where is she?
Where is Rosy?
Is one more required?
O baldy.. raise your hand!
Right now you are just breathing.
With music around, your brain
will also start to work.
Your heart will pound,
your soul will dance..
...and every inch of yours
will come to life.
You will start living again!
All of you are not plain mad.
You are idiots as well.
You are not aware of
the wonders of music.
There is music in joy and sorrow,
in gain and loss..
...and in every nook and
corner of the world.
It is in the child's wail and in
the song of the nightingale..
Music is in a mother's warmth..
...and a damsel's charms
A clock's chime and
a wife's gripe..
...and even the jingle of the
falling drizzle is full of music.
The boom and clank of
the speeding train..
...Is filled with music.
The country, the cities,
the streets..
.The flowers and
the butterflies..
...all flow with the
river of music.
Music is present in furious
gunfire and in a festive bonfire..
...and also in the wiles
of beautiful eyes.
In cassettes and CDs,
in wine and wife..
...In a sari and a midi everywhere
one can find music.
In all musical notes..
...from the first note
to the second..
...and all the way
till the seventh..
...and in every direction
music pervades.
Music exudes from the
practice of dance..
...and from spiritual
trance. In God..
Got it! Got it! Got the
last hand. - Time over.
Time is not over!
I want music.. I want music..
Doctor you don't do that.
...I really want music.
Please give me music.
You don't do that.
Your charms.
And your overflowing love
Seduce everyone!
Making everyone go ecstatic.
It impels.
Makes one see stars
in daylight.
It impels.
Makes one see stars in daylight.
Just a glimpse of your..
...drape slipping by!
It impels.
Makes one see stars in daylight.
Just a glimpse of your..
...drape slipping by!
Let's rock.
Let's shake a leg.
Let's rock.
Let's shake a leg.
Let's write our tale of love.
Immerse me in your eyes.
We have lost our hearts.
We have lost our hearts.
Just a glimpse of your..
...drape slipping by!
What a quagmire is this.
The roles of the doctor and
patient are reversed.
What a quagmire is this.
The roles of the doctor and
patient are reversed.
Such a confusion.
Madness prevails all around.
Try to understand the gestures.
Try to understand the gestures.
Just a glimpse of your..
...drape slipping by!
It impels.
Makes one see stars
in daylight.
Just a glimpse of your..
...drape slipping by!
Shut up.
Just stand there till
I tell you otherwise.
I know, father.
I know that today is the last
day for the London sponsorship.
I am doing just that. I will post
it as soon as it is over.
Bye.
Don't move. Stand still.
The cock was bitten
by the mosquito.
Don't move your hands.
Stand just where I told
you. Come here.
I will call the security
if you act..
...smart and you will be bashed up.
Don't move.
Tanvi...!
Tanvi, what are you doing?
This mad guy spoilt all my forms.
- She hit me.
Today is the last day for my
application form to be sent.
What will come of my London trip?
This mad guy has spoilt
my entire career.
Tanvi.. please...!
- I will get you new ones.
I'll get you new ones.
I will surely get
new ones for you.
Take it that you are not
destined to go to London.
In any case you wanted to have
some practice, didn't you?
From where did this research
thing came in the picture?
Tanvi, it is good to have one's ..
...wish fulfilled and
better if it is not.
I wanted to talk to you on
something since many days.
But this place and time
isn't suitable.
We'll talk in the evening.
I know that you took care of..
Shobhna Mathur like
your own daughter.
You treated her. But she did not..
...even recognize you
once she was cured.
She behaved with you as
if you were a stranger..
...and you started hating
number 36 from then.
When you saw Anand in a uniform
bearing the same number 36..
...you started hating him too.
But I know Anand very well.
He is like a younger
brother to me.
I have raised him.
When I saw him the last time..
...I never had an inkling that..
...I would see him again
in this state.
I wish that Anand should leave
this place as a normal man.
What do you mean?
People suffering from
mental disorders need..
...a treatment based on love.
I want you to help
me in this regard.
I got this diary from Anand's bag.
Read this and take your decision.
In this way my children started
fighting over my property..
...day and night just
like cats and dogs.
Things went from bad to worse.
I could not remain
passive any longer.
I decided that there
was only one way out.
So long as I do not
prepare my will..
...the people of my house
can't harm me.
That's why I put up an act of..
...going insane and
came to this place.
Got rid of the whole mess.
I have just one complaint.
I have a child.
Rahul.. he is my dearest!
His parents were killed
in an accident.
He has no one other than
me to take care of him.
Tomorrow is his birthday.
I send him a gift every
year without fail.
He must be expecting
it this year too.
What should I do?
Grandpa, it is very simple.
Let's take off our clothes.
And let's take a bath.
Tell me the address of your
grandson while we bathe.
The gift shall be delivered to
him before you have your dinner.
You are insane or they are?
...The police have lodged you here.
Don't waste your time.
Come soon. Understood?
Don't waste time there. Else
I will be the one to suffer.
Don't worry.
I returned quickly the last time.
Just drape yourself and
wait.. Keep it there.
Keep quiet!
- Speak softly.
If anyone happens to hear, we
would land in a big soup.
Understood?
You know Khurana, don't you?
He is really mad.
Who made him a doctor, then?
Well, how am I responsible
for that?
Baldy is watching us.
The doctors here are
very dangerous.
He too keeps babbling
just like you.
And jumps around a lot.
Do you know what he did to him?
He took a big knife.
And cut him here.
He shoved it straight in.
It went straight into his brain.
And then he twisted it like this.
He ground the brains
and mashed the body.
And turned him into
a living corpse.
His every activity, from
sitting to eating..
...came to a grinding halt.
In short his brain is dead.
The doctors call this coma.
Whatever it is..
But if you happen to return late..
...your life shall end up in a
comma and mine in a full stop.
Understood?
I swear by you.
Give me your uniform quickly.
And go quickly and
lie down in my bed.
C'mon move.
- Okay.
Give me.
Don't know where this idiot is.
Why didn't he turn up yet?
I am dead.
- Be quiet!
Slip quietly into bed.
It is time for the injection.
C'mon.
Come. It is time for
the injection.
Wake up, Anand.
What happened to you today?
Anthony, come here.
Hold him.
Eh! Why are you acting up?
Come on. Don't move.
Anand, take your medicine.
Come on.
You take it everyday. What
happened to you today?
Come on.. wake up!
Wake up, Anand!
Take your medicine. Come on.
Anand!
Narayan.. is it you!
I don't ever want to see
you in this hospital.
Traitor!
You are dismissed,
get out from here.
Put him in a cell.
Don't let him out till I tell you.
Grandpa, I have sent the shirt.
My heart yearns..
My heart yearns..
To make you my sweetheart.
...to become the pulse
of your life..
...to become the throb
of your heart..
...to drape myself
with your beauty..
...to drape myself
with your beauty..
...to become the throb
of your heart..
...to drape myself
with your beauty..
...to drape myself
with your beauty..
My heart yearns..
To make you my sweetheart.
...to become the pulse
of your life..
...to become the throb
of your heart..
...to drape myself
with your beauty..
...to drape myself
with your beauty..
It is my face that makes
your eyes lit..
...whether or not you accept it.
Your love is only for me..
...whether you realize it or not.
I shall transform..
...the passing moments
for your sake.
Let me become the throb
of your heart.
...and drape myself
with your beauty.
You gave solace to
my restless soul
It is hard to live without you.
I am determined to
make you mine.
You are the love of my life.
Let me hear..
...words of love from your lips.
Let me become the throb
of your heart.
...and drape myself
with your beauty.
...and drape myself
with your beauty.
My heart yearns..
To make you my sweetheart.
...to become the pulse
of your life..
Let me become the throb
of your heart.
...and drape myself
with your beauty.
God, my name is Anand.
I have heard a lot about you.
Will you help me?
I swear by you and confess that..
...I love a girl from the
bottom of my heart.
I will cut onion with open eyes.
I'll remain hungry and feed her.
God, no matter what I wear..
...but I'll buy the best for her.
I will love her all my life.
Even after she grows old..
...I'll still celebrate
Valentine's day with her.
I'll welcome her old age.
You got crucified for
the whole world.
I'll go to the gallows for her.
Because she is my only world.
What is it, son?
Hey, does God know this
language too? Wow.
Good morning, father.
- God bless you, son.
What is it? You look much tensed.
Father, you always say that
love is everything..
...and one must spread it.
- Yes.
But some people turn
a deaf ear to it.
Please make them understand
the importance of love.
Whom are you talking about?
- Someone.
She's got a beautiful face
and has stolen my heart.
Excuse me sister, I have come
from electricity department..
I am sorry, I don't know English.
That's strange! A sister
does not know English?
What did you say?
- What did you say?
Do you know Hindi?
Just a little.
- Just a little.
I got a complaint from
this orphanage..
...that there has been
a short circuit.
Because of which the whole
orphanage is in darkness.
There's some problem in one
of the rooms, I'll check it.
You stay here I'll go and check.
No..
Okay I won't go, if there's
a short circuit again..
...then it will cause a fire.
And everyone will die. You'll
have to be responsible for that.
Jesus won't ever forgive you for
this mistake. I'll go now.
Wait.
You change your mind. Then
I shall come with you.
No.
No..
Yes.
How did you know there
was a problem here?
Thanks to my 50 years
of experience.
50, but you look 25 year old.
Count my dad's experience too,
he was also an electrician.
Give me key. - Okay. But a guy in
a girl's room, is not possible
You can do it from outside.
From outside?
Sister, you are too much.
How can one prepare an omelet
without cracking the egg?
No? Then open the door.
Okay, tell me what the problem is.
No I work alone. You can go.
I'll leave the key by the
counter before going.
Neither far from you nor close,
I am your shadow.
I love you, Maya. I love you.
What are you doing?
- For you.
Are you crazy?
Yes I have become crazy.
Otherwise, does a
well educated man..
...behave in such a strange manner?
But I cannot love you.
Why?
I cannot love anyone.
Neither can I lead a married life.
Because I want to become a nun.
Leaving everything?
I wish to serve the Lord.
I'll be married only
to the Lord and..
...my love will be devoted
only to humanity.
This is what I have learnt
from Father Steven..
...ever since I lost my parents.
Everything other than
this is a sin.
I love you. I still love you.
Father, I need some
answers from you.
Yeah, tell me son.
Who has made the world,
man and love?
God.
For whom did he make it?
For human beings.
So does God wish a person
to stay close..
...to him even if he's sad?
No.
Is it written in any book
that one should..
...give up everything for God?
No, nothing as such
is written anywhere.
Did you hear that?
Please make Maya understand,
she loves me.
Maya, is it true?
It's true, Father.
Ask me, her silence speaks it all.
Maya, is it true?
Sorry son, till she doesn't
say anything..
...I am helpless.
She will say it, she will have to.
Because I'll make her say it.
Maya, do you love me or not.
Maya, I know that you love me.
I know it very well.
It's no use lying
by keeping quiet.
I know you won't say anything.
But if you don't love me, then
I won't love myself either.
Maya, people are burnt
after death..
...but I'll burn myself for you.
Hey, what is that?
Petrol..
Maya, this is your last chance.
I am giving myself a chance.
I'll count till ten.
One
Two
Three
Four
Five
Six
Seven
Eight
Nine
Nine...?
Nine..
Don't you know what's after it?
No, I don't.
I was poor in Math as a child.
Today, I'll give you two advices.
One is, learn Math well..
...and the other is never
to fall in love.
I have always dreamt..
...that my Knight will
come riding a horse..
...and carry me off in his arms.
I know that your face resembles
that of my Knight.
Really?
- I swear by you.
And the horse looked like this?
Don't know, but I always thought..
...how these men could
ride a horse.
Is that so? Do you wish to learn?
No, what if something happened?
What will happen,
when I am with you?
No.. - I won't let anything
happen to you.
I cannot do this.
- C'mon.
Come, nothing will happen.
It's very easy.
- I cannot do it at all.
What are you doing?
Are you frightened?
- Yes a bit.
I didn't ask you, I was
asking this horse.
Anand, please! I am nervous.
Okay this is the rein. They
walk with its command.
This is for left turn,
and this for right..
...when you pull it,
the horse stops.
To make it walk just
nudge it gently.
That's simple. Grip
the rein tightly.
C'mon let's go. Good.
Maya, wait.
Anand, I cannot handle it.
- Maya pull the rope.
Didn't I tell I don't
know how to ride?
Maya, pull the rope.
Maya, pull the rope.
- Anand, please help me.
Anand, I'll fall down.
Maya, pull the rope.
Anand, I cannot do it..
I always have a doubt.
What?
How people drive their cars!
I have been made a fool
once, not this time.
I swear, I don't know
how to drive.
Really?
- Yes.
Really?
- Yes dear.
Okay then I'll teach you to ride.
- No.
Why not?
- Not now.
What if something happens?
- Nothing will happen. Sit.
It's very easy, just concentrate.
This is left and this
is right. Okay.
On the left is the clutch,
the break is in ..
...the center and the accelerator
on the right.
Whenever you change gears,
press that clutch.
Press the clutch; put
in the first gear.
Press the accelerator.
Excuse me, move..
Thank you, very good.
Cool, Fantastic.
You are such an amazing learner.
Slow. Slow.
Please ride the car slowly.
When I was running towards
you on the roof..
...such was my condition.
For a minute I wondered
what would happen..
...If you came to some harm.
First you cheated me and
now I cheated you.
We are equal now.
Tomorrow is Christmas
and our wedding too.
I have invited my
friend for dinner.
I introduced Maya to everyone.
When they came to know
that she sings well..
...they forced Maya to sing.
But she was hesitating.
They kept forcing her and
she kept hesitating.
Please sing. Here take this.
Anand, please! I cannot sing.
C'mon, sing.
Why does my love for you..
...swell so up and high?
What more can I give you..
...except my life?
Why does my love for you
swell so up and high?
What more can I give you,
except my life?
Why does my love for
you swell so high?
You have mesmerized me
to an extent such..
...to an extent such..
...that I lost all my world
and my heart too as much
I lost my heart too as much.
Fill your tunes with the
overtones of affection
My life is only for you,
have at least some concern
Have at least some concern..
Why does my love for you
swell so up and high?
What more can I give you,
except my life?
Why does my love for you
swell so up and high?
'You are my breath..
...my heartbeat and the cause
of my infatuation
The Creator made me so
infatuated only about you..
...that I dedicated
my life just for you
My life is just for you
O my love, promise me that
you will be my companion
My life is only for you,
have at least some concern
Have at least some concern..
Why does my love for you
swell so up and high?
What more can I give you,
except my life?
Why does my love for
you swell so high?
What more can I give you?
What more can I give you?
What more can I give you?
What more can I give you..
...except my life?
Maya, what are you thinking?
I always pondered about..
...how people could swim like fish.
I wish I could swim like that.
So, you don't know to swim.
Get up, these tricks won't work
any more. Think of something new.
Anand, I really can't swim.
Is that so?
- Yes.
So you can't swim?
- Yes.
I'll go and pay the bill. Till
then you learn to swim.
You cannot trick me every time.
- Anand, I am scared.
One, two, three
Excuse me, sir..
- Yes. - Your bill.
Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir!
Anand, today the party was fun.
- Thanks a lot.
Okay, we'll meet tomorrow
at your wedding. - Okay.
Sir.
- Yes. - Thank you.
Maya.
Sing this song and
make it eternal.
Befriend me, make
my life beautiful.
I don't subscribe
to your father's..
...military style of
handling things.
Ring the bell three
times everyday.
Put two tablets in the mouth.
If the patient starts
to complain..
...give him a shock
and make him sleep.
The treatment is over.
The shock one gets on hearing
about someone's elopement..
...Is different from
the shock one gets..
...on hearing a beggar
winning a huge lottery.
How can you treat both
of them similarly?
What did you understand
about Anand?
What a tragic case this is!
I felt very sorry to
hear about all this.
Yes, Tanvi.
He either forgot his past..
...or he is acting that way..
...to escape from his
memories of the past.
Who knows what lies in the
depths of the human heart?
But I don't think
that he is acting.
There are many patients who hide..
...their thoughts from
us, like thieves.
What should we do in such a case?
If they are thieves..
then we have to..
...become policemen and catch them.
Take it up as a challenge.
Anand!
Won't you sing a song today?
Take me out somewhere today.
What if father comes
to know of this?
We shall take him with us.
Please come!
I will sing a song for you.
I will please you with my antics.
I haven't been out
since many days.
Take me out.
Okay.
But tomorrow and not today.
He will not run away.
His mind is like that of a kid.
He may not listen to us..
...but he can be explained with
patience and affection.
Shall I take Anthony with me?
No. He would have run
away if he wanted to.
I know my Anand very well.
What if father comes
to know of this?
So what? It is part
of the treatment.
And it is my responsibility
finally.
It is my call.
Should I do like this?
Don't you have faith in yourself?
Because I am going to do this
for the first time in life.
Man learns from experience.
First play along the
game and then..
...decide how to play the game.
It is done.
Didn't I shave well?
How can I know?
You only tell me.
Shall we go now?
In these clothes?
- Why? Aren't they nice?
I am talking about my clothes.
I have another set of
clothes in my bag.
Please get them.
Will I get to see the moon?
Mad! Mad!
Stop it!
Anand!
The season said this
to the blooms
And the blooms conveyed
it to their fragrance
Which in turn passed
it on to the bees
And the bees filled the
honey with this message
These symbols of our love
are here to stay..
...even after you and I go away.
Let's complete a hundred
lives in a moment of love
Let's complete a hundred
lives in a moment of love
Let's complete a hundred
lives in a moment of love
You awoke in me the yearning
And taught me the art of living
You awoke in me the yearning
And taught me the art of living
In moments of my loneliness..
...you raised in me many desires
These sagas.. these
stories that move
Never end, as time will prove
Let's complete a hundred
lives in a moment of love
Let's complete a hundred
lives in a moment of love
What happened.. when
two eyes met
Many perceptions changed,
most of which were set
What happened.. when
two eyes met
Many perceptions changed,
most of which were set
I just walked with
you steps a couple
And I think of sharing with
you my joy and trouble
This longing.. this love
This is not just an
illusion, I hope
Let's complete a hundred
lives in a moment of love
Let's complete a hundred
lives in a moment of love
These symbols of our love
are here to stay..
...even after you and I go away.
Let's complete a hundred
lives in a moment of love
Anand! Anand! Please wait for me.
Such a thing never happened
here before.
A patient who is a killer
and a schizophrenic..
...Is roaming freely in the city.
If he attacks someone..
...who will be responsible
for that?
The press and the
TV wait eagerly..
...for sensational news
just like this.
The reputation of this hospital
will be ruined.
The effort of twenty five years will
be washed off in a trice.
Answer me, Dr. Sunil.
Sir, many times we send patients
out of the hospital..
...when special treatment
is needed.
Does Anand's name figure in
the list of those patients?
No.
- So?
Sir, Anand is a special
case for us.
What did you sayl?
A special case!
How did a killer become
a special case?
Oh I see!
It is because he is
related to you.
You are repaying your
indebtedness to him.
Isn't it?
And don't you have any
responsibility..
...towards this hospital?
Father, it is I who
took Anand out.
It is not Sunil.
But the night that he
ran away from here..
Sunil was the in-charge.
I just felt that it
won't be a mistake..
...to take him out for a while.
How could you think that?
How could you have done
such an idiotic..
...and irresponsible thing?
Sorry! I don't need
people around here..
...who do as they wish.
Till the time as that mad
guy isn't captured..
...you shall not enter
this hospital.
Is it clear?
Sir..
- No! She is suspended.
Operator, give me police station.
Sir, this is not fair.
What clothes was he
wearing when he left?
Just find out and let me know.
- Sir.. sir.
I don't want to listen to anyone.
Red bangles.
I broke yours, didn't I?
I searched a lot for them.
But there is a shortage
of red bangles here.
I got them only at one place.
I brought them from that place.
If the police is here.
Don't tell them I am here.
Come with me.
The conference will
be over in 3 days.
But I will stay on
for some more days.
Karan too will return from London.
And I will return with him.
In case of any emergency..
...you have my contact
number with you.
I want to tell you something..
...that is very important.
After I leave, don't
let these cattle..
...roam everywhere like
wild creatures.
If you show them more affection
than is needed..
...they will make you pay for that.
Patients behave properly..
...only when they fear the doctor.
Understood?
- Yes sir.
The application for my leave..
...Is there on the table.
Hand it over to the manager.
- Okay.
Sir! Sir, I made a mistake.
Who let him in?
Pardon me, sir.
Security! Throw him out.
Please don't do that, sir. I
have little kids back home.
I have lost everything.
May everything of
yours get ruined.
Sir!
- Hello! Hello!
Who are you calling?
Amitabh Bachchan.
Why?
Because his incoming
calls are free.
Don't joke. You were calling
Rahul, weren't you?
I longed to speak to him.
Don't worry. The exams
must be going on.
I will arrange it as soon
as the exams are over.
Okay? Go now.
- Thank you. - Go.
Anand!
Give me one more.
You must eat only one per day.
It's for Michael and not for me.
Take this.
Anand, what else will you have?
Will you have an apple?
- Yes.
Yes?
Anand, do you remember?
The garden at Ramgarh?
We used to steal apples from
there during childhood.
Stealing.. You don't know?
Ramgarh.. Ramgarh.
I fell down too.. twice.
Isn't it?
- What is that?
You may also recall..
...that we met at the village fair.
Yes? There was a temple
of Lord Shiva there too.
And there were many peacocks
in its backyard.
And you.. you caught one of them.
I want a peacock feather..
I went to pluck a peacock
feather.. with a stick.
I ran and you followed
me. Remember?
The priest ran after the peacock
and we chased him.
Remember?
Yes, and how we ran
in the streets!
By fooling him.
From that street to this
and this to that.
Remember that?
Do you remember all
these even now?
Yes, I do.
Anand, Remember that?
- Brother Sunil!
Where is your home?
Which is your home town?
Who are you?
Brother Sunil, can
I take this book?
Want to read it?
No. I want to tear its pages
and make rockets of them.
I will hit that policeman
with them.
Who is Maya?
What happened later?
Having heard the entire
story all night..
...you ask what the beginning is!
What is the beginning?
I will tell you that
later. Go now.
Thank you.
But you know something..
When I spoke about Maya, the
expression on his face changed.
There is only one
way to make Anand..
...remember his past. That is Maya!
What's the matter?
Why do you look so dull today?
Come home with me.
I will make some good
coffee for you.
The breeze is cool.
Raise the windscreen near you.
What happened?
This place is not good.
Let's go.
This is my house. Let's go in.
Go and sit in my room. I'll
get coffee for you.
Anand! Anand!
What more can I offer you
than my life, dear?
What are you doing? You will
disturb everyone else.
What happened?
Won't you sing it for me?
Brother Sunil, can I sing
a song? I'll sing slowly.
I kept asking you to sing a song..
...but you didn't sing, why
now all of a sudden?
Sing, one minute.
I longed to hear you voice.
We used to sing like
this in our village.
Sing"
Did you call me?
I have a special gift for you.
I used to get such special
gifts as a child.
From my parents and Santosh.
But it stopped as I grew older.
And now-a-days I don't
get any at all.
This is for me, isn't it?
Then give it to me.
Here take a look.
Should I open it?
It's just that..
...I love you so much
It's just that..
...I love you so much
What more can I offer you..
...other than my life, my dear
It's just that..
...I love you so much
Give my heart a bit
of attention..
I live only for you, can't
you show some concern?
Can't you show some concern?
It's just that I
love you so much
Maya..
You have mesmerized me
to an extent such..
...to an extent such..
...that I lost all my world
and my heart too as much
I lost my heart too as much.
Fill your tunes with the
overtones of affection
My life is only for you,
have at least some concern
Have at least some concern..
It's just that I
love you so much
Maya..
'You are my breath..
...my heartbeat and the cause
of my infatuation
The Creator made me so
infatuated only about you..
...that I dedicated
my life just for you
My life is just for you
O my love, promise me that
you will be my companion
My life is only for you,
have at least some concern
Have at least some concern..
Why does my love for you
swell so up and high?
What more can I give you?
What more can I give you?
What more can I give you..
...except my life?
It's just that I
love you so much
Maya, please don't go. Come back.
How many days is it
since I came here?
Anand..
Did you recognize me?
Brother Sunil.
And who is she?
How can I forget her?
Maya.
I know she is Tanvi.
Brother, I feel dizzy.
I know you'll be alright now.
Can I leave this place?
Yes. I'll inform your
elder brother..
...he'll take you back home.
Anand need not stay here any more.
What do you say, Tanvi?
C'mon..
So, will Anand go away from here?
Yes.
How can he?
No, it's alright.
Let him go.
He should go.
Who am I to stop? What is
my relation with him?
He should go.
What is going on in your heart?
Don't think about such things.
Even if you are thinking
about them..
...then don't let it go further.
Keep it to yourself.
Brother Sunil, no one understands
me better than you.
If Anand leaves then I won't
ever return to this hospital.
Tanvi, you'll come along,
won't you?
I requited your love with
my heart filled with pain
I requited your love with
my heart filled with pain
This heart is given,
it is yours.
I requited your love with
my heart filled with pain
I requited your love with
my heart filled with pain
This heart is given,
it is yours.
This heart is given,
it is yours.
I live only because
of you, my love..
Only because of you
The nights can no longer
be passed in solitude
No more solitude, my love
I have become yours, my dreams
are filled with you
This heart is given,
it is yours.
I dedicated my life for you
I did that, sweetheart
I gave your name to
my story of love
I named if after you, my love
I loved only you and gave
myself up only for you
This heart is given,
it is yours.
I requited your love with
my heart filled with pain
I requited your love with
my heart filled with pain
This heart is given, its yours.
Have you fallen in love?
Greetings sir.
Karan, freshen up and take rest.
I'll bring Tanvi from
the hospital.
Put his luggage in the guest room.
Sir, our patient, No.42,
Ramlal Nasiwala..
His parents came and
took him away.
They were happy and will be
coming here to distribute sweets.
Very good. Our happiness
lies in theirs.
Anything else?
There's more good news.
Our patient No. 36..
...Anand, he's normal now.
His treatment is over in
a month? Congrats Sunil.
Congratulate Tanvi and not me.
She has worked selflessly
on this case.
I informed his brother
and the lawyer.
And I am sure the court
will also acquit him.
Good.
Karan must be lonely at home.
Go and give him company.
And you haven't given me
the list of invitees yet.
Whom are you going to call?
Finish it and give it to me.
Sunil, keep yourself
free for some days..
...as Tanvi's wedding is going
to be a grand function.
This is the first wedding
invitation..
...and I am starting it from you.
You are the only close
person in our lives.
What do you say, Tanvi?
Sunil, what are you
doing this evening?
Come and have dinner with us.
And you haven't met Karan yet.
You've just seen his photos.
You'll know him better
when you see him.
That I have chosen the
right match for Tanvi.
C'mon Tanvi.
Do come. don't..
Don't run away, okay!
I don't know in what
state I'll be back.
No matter what my condition is..
...you must take me back.
Did you get that? - Okay.
Hey, old man, is that
military man at home?
Who?
- Your master.
Call him out.
Narayan?
What are you doing here?
- Greetings, sir.
I made a big mistake.
I came to apologize.
Please give me my job back.
Impossible!
Please don't do this, sir.
I have a family, sir.
You know it very well..
...that I never change
my decisions.
Is it your final decision?
- Yes!
If you won't mind, can
I say something?
What is it?
Khurana!
What do you think of yourself?
Hey Narayan!
Narayan doesn't care any more.
Do you think that you are
a Governor or a king?
You went to England..
...worked as a servant
for some Richard..
...and brought money back here.
Then you bought a bungalow
for yourself.
You admitted some insane people..
...and made them follow
your military rules.
And so you are showing
off for that?
You aren't a foolish man.
You are a selfish man.
Who let him in?
You stupid military man.
Keep your child in check first.
I have seen two love birds today..
...singing behind a tree.
Do you know who they were?
One of them was your daughter..
...and the other one was
that insane guy, Anand.
Stop your nonsense.
Shut up, don't speak without turn.
Only I'll speak, today.
I'll spread this all
over the village.
I'll tell one and all that Tanvi
and Anand love each other.
I swear I'll ruin you and
your daughter's reputation.
And if I don't, then you can
name your dog after me.
No, you should name your
dog after yourself.
You..
Sorry sir.
May I coming sir.
- Coming.
Whenever I go out
on some business..
...I leave all the
responsibilities to you.
Even my daughter also.
I have always trusted you.
We've known each other
since many years.
I never knew you could
break my trust.
I have heard something about
my daughter today.
I want you to say whether
it's true or false.
If it's something bad, it
cannot happen with Tanvi.
Can there be any other
relation between..
...Tanvi and Anand other than
that of a doctor and patient?
You have to answer me.
Did you ask Tanvi about it?
I don't need to ask her anything.
I just want to know the truth.
Tanvi has contributed a
lot in Anand's treatment.
But I didn't know matters
could become worse.
You know it very well that
I have many dreams..
...regarding this hospital
and Tanvi.
Many ambitions.
I cannot see my dream
being shattered.
Sunil, I can do anything
for Tanvi's happiness.
But should I give her
away to an insane man?
Sunil.
Why don't you make my
daughter understand?
I am afraid, it won't work.
The matter is now at quite
an advanced stage.
I will not allow this.
I will never allow this!
Tanvi, who is Anand?
He's a patient of this hospital.
That is, you are a doctor
and he a patient, isn't it?
No.
Then what?
I love Anand.
You love him and want
to marry him?
Isn't it?
Yes.
Had we been just friends..
...you wouldn't have been
so frank with me.
Any way, best wishes. Congrats.
Karan..
- Hey!
Don't call me Karan. You
can call me as earlier.
There's no need to be formal.
Relax!
Tanvi, I won't take away
your happiness from you.
So the matter has
come to this stage!
People say that I don't
know what love is.
They are right.
Because I gave all my love to you.
And if you forgo this love
for an insane murderer..
...then it will be
unbearable for me.
And if you force me, I can
become a very cruel man.
Good morning sir!
Hey, get up.
Did you come to your
In-laws house?
Didn't your parents teach
you any manners?
Would you enter anyone's cabin
and sit down like this?
That too before a person
who is elder to you?
Sir, a son never asks a father's
permission to sit.
But if you don't like it,
then please do forgive me.
I am sorry.
What do you think?
That you are normal now?
You aren't insane any more?
Do you think you are too smart?
You are insane.
Everyone's insane, sir.
For an intelligent guy a
foolish man is insane.
For a foolish man an intelligent
man is insane.
Anything in extremities
it bad for humans.
Even love!
And that's what I did.
But today, I am absolutely normal.
If I start giving insane
people like you..
...a certificate of being normal,
then what's my use here?
A doctor who serves humanity
is very much needed.
And nobody needs those..
...who make it their business
So now you decide which one of
these applies to you. - Shut up!
You think you are some great guy?
Seeing any girl and following
her like a love-struck guy..
...Is also one of the
symptoms of insanity.
It doesn't matter who she is.
A mother, sister or a doctor.
You are just like an animal..
- Enough!
That you could even
think of such things!
Those thoughts never
even occur to me.
And you want me to respect you?
Respect is not acquired with age..
...It has to earned.
I don't want to argue any more.
Just let me go.
Let you go! Where?
Home!
I have to prove my innocence
in the court.
My brother has come
to take me away.
All my bills have been cleared.
Just let me go.
I'll decide whether you
have to stay here or go.
Me! Did you get that?
You cannot do this.
Here I can do anything.
No one is going to question
my authority.
Security, take him away. And
prepare for shock treatment.
' ' Y are you do- .
' MY Wish! lng It?
You know it.
- I will do it.
You know that I am not insane.
- Take him away.
Take him away from here.
Brother, please take
me away from here.
I am alright now. Take
me away from here.
Brother, I am not insane.
Doctor, what is happening?
I'd been informed that my
brother is normal now.
That's what we thought.
But this development can
happen in such cases.
You think he's alright..
...but it relapses.
It's your wish. You can
take him with you.
When he's normal again..
...please inform me.
I'll come to receive him.
Don't worry.
He is in safe hands.
This isn't right, sir.
This is cruelty.
You are mixing your professional..
...and personal lives.
This is wrong.
So what are you doing?
Why are you so interested
in this case..
...of all the cases
in our hospital.
Oh, I know you've been given
the responsibility..
...to search a bride
for a rich kid.
Sir, you aren't in a state
to be made aware..
...of right and wrong.
Sir, it would be better
if you let Anand go.
I won't let him go until
I am fully convinced.
Don't try to misinterpret
the truth.
Anand's memory, his
way of talking..
...everything is like
a normal human being.
My years of experience
cannot be false, sir.
Do you mean to say that..
...my experience is
of no importance.?
That my observation is wrong?
Is it wrong?
- I don't mean that.
Don't mix Tanvi's problem
and this treatment.
I'll speak to Tanvi, I'll
make her understand.
No, it will be useless.
I won't bear it if Anand
is declared insane..
...and closed here in this
hospital forever.
Okay then..
Go away on some vacation.
Take some rest.
How can you be so cold blooded?
Please!
I beg of you, let Anand go.
Nothing stands before
my daughter's welfare.
Then listen to this carefully.
Everyone's life is important.
It's my duty to save Anand.
And I know how to fulfill it.
- No!
If he is set free then I'll
lose my daughter forever.
And I cannot let this happen.
One more thing.
I need only those people
who listen to me..
...and take it as my final verdict.
If you agree with
it then it's okay.
Otherwise you can resign
from your job.
Or I'll fire you.
This is not a hospital
but a prison.
What is Anand's fault..
...that he's being imprisoned
here for life?
Well he has, he fell
in love with you.
If loving someone is a crime ..
...then you are the criminal.
It was you who started all this.
Even after knowing everything..
You..
I don't want to hurt
you saying all this.
I don't know what I should do.
I will have to save Anand.
I'll try and talk to
my father, maybe..
Nothing will happen.
One who is blinded with hatred..
...won't understand anything.
I'll make him understand.
I'll tell father that I
am ready to marry Karan.
Okay.
Punish me for loving Anand.
You won't do anything
of that sort.
What will we gain?
Anand will be free
but he'll become..
...the same person that he
was when he came here.
He'll break down.
Then, what should I do?
I don't know either.
No matter what..
Tonight, I'll set him free.
I won't care for the consequences.
But Anand will not leave
this place alone.
That you have to decide.
Wherever you go, you
both will be happy.
I know that.
The doctor is calling you.
Anand, there's a solution
for every problem.
Your benefit lies in telling
Tanvi that you don't love her.
That you still love your
deceased beloved.
Tanvi will accept it.
You'll be freed as soon
as she gets married.
Then you can go wherever you want.
Are you trying to reason
with an insane guy?
I know you aren't insane.
Yes I am, in Tanvi's love.
Stop your nonsense.
Then you can stay here forever.
Till when will you
keep me imprisoned?
Till I die.
...or till you remain alive.
NO one can save YOU
Nobody can save you!
Lock him up!
Doctor!
I too will see till when
you can keep me here.
I'll see how you can stop me.
Sir, are you alright sir?
Tanvi, wait outside the hospital.
I'll come along with Anand.
Tanvﬂ
It's cold out here.
Come I'll drop you. Come.
Sister Sawant, bring patient
number 36 to the operation room.
Okay sir.
There is leakage in the pipe.
Check it.
Are you upset with me?
- No.
Tanvﬂ
Aren't you forgetting something?
What?
You don't need this ring any more.
Take it off.
Anand..
Can you hear me?
I couldn't do anything for you.
You could have given me a chance.
I could have done something.
I always wanted you
to live royally..
...and longed to keep you happy.
Go my brother. Go.
Anand, get UP!
Get up!
You are acting aren't you.
See you'll get up all of a sudden.
He said that he'd go.
He's gone.
Call the police.
I killed him.
I was indebted to you.
I have fulfilled it.
I did it for you.
I killed him for you.
A dead man is of no use to anyone.
So I did it for him.
I killed him..
...because he cannot call
brother Sunil any more.
I didn't want this Anand.
Sol killed him for myself.
Sol killed him for myself.
Myself..
