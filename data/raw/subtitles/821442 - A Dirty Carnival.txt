A DIRTY CARNIVAL
ZO In-sung
CHUN Ho-jin
You fucking bastard.
You're a gangster?
You wanna be a gangster, too?
Let go. Fucking bastard!
Beays up a person and
throws away money.
I have to admit
he's good for nothing though
he's my son.
He needs years behind bars
before he comes to his senses.
Stop it already.
We should be thankful
they accepted our offer.
By the way,
what shall we do?
We only have
a month to move out.
Where can we get
that much money?
Produced by TCHA Sung-jai
KIM Mi-hee / CHOI Sun-joong
I'll find a way.
No, it's okay.
I'll get the money
somehow this time.
I'll get the money.
Don't worry, mom.
You wanna get sick again?
This is for Sun-ok's academy
and your medication.
Do you still
have chest pains?
They're tolerable.
You'd better not be seen
with those scamps again.
Next time, I'm gonna
break your legs.
- See you.
- Okay.
Drive safely and
come by more often.
I think mom's condition's
gotten worse these days.
OK.
Here.
A cell phone?
It's not for you to chat and
text message with your friends
I can keep it?
Call mom whenever you're
late from the academy.
- OK
- Go in.

Oh, KIM Byung-doo?
I know him well.
Really?
How do you know him?
I was in charge
ofthe Rotary gang.
I met him then.
How do you know him?
He's my friend
from elementary.
Oh, he's your friend?
Yeah. I've been asking every
policeman I met to find him
You should see him then,
rather than talking to me
If it's for your movie,
you should talk to
the gangster himself.
I guess so.
You motherfuckers!
You think you
can leave whenever you want?
You think this is some kind a club?
A fucking picnic?
Straighthen up.
I'm home, boss.
Why did you bring them back
ifthey didn't wanna be here anymore?
- Jong-soo.
- Yes, boss.
From now on, cut their
fingers before they leave.
Yes, boss.
- You, youngest!
- Yes, boss.
- It's tough isn't it?
- No, it's ok, boss.
Let's bear
it a little longer.
Since we're already here,
might as well go all the way.
- Hey, Hippo!
- Yes, boss.
What's our philosophy?
Yes, boss.
Never lose face,
never getjumped on,
Get your shoes polished
even if you skip a meal.
Though we may starve to death,
we should never fail
to respect ourselves
So what do you become the minute
you lose integrity? A scamp.
- Am I right?
- Right, boss.
Let's try our best.
- Let's go working!
- Yes, boss.
Apartment number 108-503!
Bitch, gimme my money!
CHOI Sun-duk, Pay back
if you borrowed my money!
Residenys of building 108!
My family's starving because
apt. 503 won't pay me back!
Who are you calling a bitch!
Honey, call the police!
Go ahead, call again.
Let's go by the fucking law.
You're going a bit too far,
young man.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't have any money!
Hello? Sun-ok?
Byung-doo?
Can you hear me?
Yup. Got good connection.
What's up?
I forgot to say thank you
for the cell phone.
Hey, go back your studying and
don't waste your time calling me.
The fruit of patience is what?
It's sweet.
Gotta go, I'm working.
Damn, what are you doing?
Do it harder, make me hard.
Higher, higher.
That's right.
That's right, there.
- Get back to your room.
- Right there. Good.
I was hurting right there.

Who are you under?
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
I'm so fucking busy getting
ready for my business.
How could I fucking interrupt yours?
What?
Yeah, go ahead!
We're gonna open as planned.
Do whatever you want!
Bring your axe and shit!
Shit!
- Hey!
- Yes, boss.
Hey, why did you make
it so noticeable?
Sorry, boss.
I tried my best.
We might as well clean them
up for good this time, boss!
Leave it.
Don't make things big.
Take care of it at your level.
Yes, boss.
Later, boss.
Boss, is everything okay?
Yeah, the game room...
- So you got it?
- Yes, boss.
Good.
Here, this is for you.
Boss, give us a bit more.
Hey, times are difficult
for me too.
Getting my only sister
married cosys a shit load.
A bit more, boss.
We can't even pay rent
these days.
Dumb ass!
Getting cheated
by your own sponsor...
Let's wait 'til things
get better.
You said that before, boss.
What!
Boss, can't you just pretend
you skipped a racecourse bet?
You fucking with me?
How dare you fuck with me...
Byung-doo,
how old are you this year?
Twenty-nine, boss.
Twenty-nine, huh?
And look at yourself.
Still begging for money...
Shouldn't you be getting
somewhere by now?
Six villas and 20% a month.
Get them notarized...
Why waste money?
We are the notary.
Then make sure you get
all the right documenys.
Right, boss.
How are you, boss!
Yes, Byung-doo!
Heard you did a greatjob.
It's nothing.
No, no, that wasn't
easy money to get back.
Sang-chul's got
a smart kid under him.
All my boys are smart, boss.
Byung-doo, we're about
to go for a drink. Join us.
- Don't mind me.
- Come along.
You can be
boss's designated driver.
I like you cause you don't
look like a gangster.
Gangsters need to look
like this nowadays.
It's hard to do business
looking like him.
Boss,
I've been getting facials.
Byung-doo, got a sponsor?
No, boss. Not anymore.
Things didn't work out,
boss.
His sponsor flew
with our investment money.
It's hell of a situation, boss.
Then why don't you let him
manage the new game room?
Yes, boss.
I was thinking about that.
I love you, boss.

don't do this to me

Hello.
Yes, I'm having a drink
with some employees.
Uh?
I'm afraid I can't right now.
Yes, I know.
Yes, give me some more time.
I'm sorry.
♪ I can't believe
I love you
♪ Though you're not...
Fucking asshole!
What a pain in the ass.
But try to work things out.
- Sang-chul.
- Yes, boss.
Why don't you take
attorney PARK for me?
What?
Couldn't you quietly
solve this situation?
What do you mean?
I can't sleep well knowing
he's pulling my strings.
If you do it for me, got your
back for the rest of your life.
Can you do it?
Boss, we'll all get fucked.
You know that boss.
I'll do anything, but an attorney...
It's a different matter.
Right.
I knew it'd be hard.
Glory Game Land
Boss.
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks for coming.
You're raking in money.
Rake in my ass.
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.
Heard you're gonna be
in charge ofthis place.
- Yes.
-Good luck, boy.
It's a good location, all it
needs is a good management.
This is just the beginning.
Soon, we'll
own several ofthese.
We need to get a good sponsor
and start making a fortune.
By the way boss,
we're gonna have some trouble
with the Three-way gang.
This is their district,
isn't it?
Hey, I'm going for a drink
with the guesys.
I'll be back soon.
- Okay, boss.
- Ok.
- Jong-soo, gimme some light.
- Yes, boss.
You've come a long way
smoking in front of me.
It's a special day, boss.
Let me smoke just this one.
So you like driving
that BMW?
You know it's not my car.
Son of a bitch!
Stop going around kissing
boss's ass and act right.
What?
I heard you've been
making trouble
at Three-way's game room.
Are you going to fight them
alone ifthey gain up on us?
What are you scared about?
It needs to happen anyway.
Hey, this business is mine.
Don't you butt in.
Byung-doo!
Hey, Min-ho!
KIM Min-ho!
Hey, long time no see.
Yeah, it's been a while.
How long has it been, man?
I know. It's been ages.
Hey, you still look the same.
You too, man. I could
spot you out in an instant.
Oh yeah?
So why is it
so hard to see you?
I looked up
everywhere to find you.
Oh yeah?
Detective WOO
called this morning.
He says
you're a filmmaker?
I'm working on something.
Man, it's so cool I have
a friend who's a film director.
What about you Byung-doo?
How's work?
I'm running that place
and doing this and that.
Heard you wanted to
meet gangsters?
Yeah, I'm preparing
a gangster movie.
I met some detectives
Now I need to meet
some gangsters.
I don't know if it'll help.
They're just
like normal people.
Still... I need to learn
about their world.
Hey, are you still keeping
in touch with elementary friends?
Sure, I see them once in a while
at the reunion evenys.
Then have you seen
KANG Hyun-joo?
KANG Hyun-joo?
Yeah, I saw her
at the last gathering.
You remember her?
I remember
my close friends.
So, how is she doing?
I heard she works
at a book store.
Yeah, Jong-soo.
what?
Son of a bitch!
You motherfucker.
Son of a bitch!
Fucking motherfuckers.
Come in all of you!
- Young-pil!
- Yes, boss.
- Call the Three-way fucks.
- Yes, boss.
- Byung-doo!
- Yes, boss.
It's war.
Gather all the boys.
Yes, boss.
Young-pil...
where are you?
What?
Stuck in traffic?
We're nearly there so get
here as soon as you can!
Shit, run them over!
Motherfuckers.
Open the trunk!
Shit
Son of a bitch.
Die! Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Motherfuckers!
Boss!
What was he thinking?
Big boss made things messy
gutting that boy for nothing
Boss,
isn't our whole family
in deep shit if he dies?
Shut up!
Let's wait 'til the boss
geys things settled
Big boss'd better
not forget us,
after everything
we did this time.
Yeah, Sun-ok.
What?!
Why on earth would you join
the demonstration?
You have any idea how
dangerous they are?
You thought they'd build around
our house if you protested?
What else could I do?
By the way,
what happened to your face?
Were you in a fight again?
Never mind my face.
You and Byung-sik, both of you...
It's all my fault.
Don't use
your fisys anymore.
Wars are outdated now.
You have to use your brains,
Not your sashimi knives.
Yes, boss.
So how did you settle it?
We paid some compensation
and Young-pil is going in.
- Young-pil is?
- Yes, boss.
I asked him to do it for me.
So I let his boys take
care ofthe game room.
Boss, what do you mean?
I had to do it.
It was the least
I could do for him.
Boss...
Sir, attorney PARK wanys to
see you in the next room.
Attorney PARK's here?
Who told him I was here?
Did I make a mistake?
What shall I tell him?
Tell him I'll be there.
This asshole is
a stumbling block in my life.
Boss, just have a
drink with him.
Go to boss's car and wait.
Boss, can I talk to you?
What is it?
How can you do this to me?
You need to understand.
Boss,
did I ever disobey you?
What is it that Young-pil did
that I didn't do for you?
I know. Next time, OK?
Boss, please just this once.
Our family is about to get
thrown out to the streeys.
Please reconsider, boss.
Then you wanna go in
instead ofYoung-pil?
- See you again.
- Yeah, see you next time.
- Is boss's car ready?
- Yes, boss.
- Hey!
- Yes?
- That's this?
- Oh, he's with me.
Meet attorney PARK.
He's a gangster too then.
Hey, come over here.
Fucking gangsters...
Parasites of our society...
Loser like this should be all
sucked up with a vacuum cleaner.
Why don't you leave
the poor kid alone.
Hey, Myung-geun.
You're neither a civilian nor
a gangster. What are you?
A mutt?
Act straight.
Let's have a smoke.
People need
to age gracefully.
Attorneys aren't easy.
How old are you?
Twenty-nine, boss.
That's when Sang-chul came.
He was quick back then.
He's come a long way...
or maybe went too far.
There's so much to do but it's
hard to find someone who'll last.
You should find
a good sponsor
and start making real money.
You can't be a gangster
forever.
Thanks for your advice, boss.
Byung-doo,
you just need to know
two things to be successful.
Who you need,
and what he needs...
It seems Sang-chul doesn't
need anything anymore.
Thanks for driving.
Good night, boss.
Think of me
as your big brother.
Yes.
Go home now.
Good night.
Sorry for coming back,
boss.
It's okay. What is it?
Do you have...
a name card
ofthat attorney?
This is serious stuff.
All our necks are on the line.
You don't have to join me.
I'll do it myself
if you're not in.
How can you say
such a thing.
We're both ouysiders,
starting out as club waiters...
When will we make our
fortune living like this?
Do you think we can ever find
another sponsor like this?
Jong-soo!
Yes, boss.
Trust me on this one.
Yes, boss.
I'm here because of you.
I'll go if you go.
Good. Let's go for it.
See if you can
find out anything.
Work quietly.
Mr. CHOI!
How are you?
Hey,
what are you doing here?
I was waiting for you
but you didn't come...
Right, we had an appointment.
Sorry, I forgot.
It's not a problem.
But, can I talk to you
for a minute?
Right now?
I can't.
I have a meeting.
How about tomorrow?
See you tomorrow.
Then, have you read
my scenario?
Your scenario?
Why don't you look for
something else?
The story hasn't changed
a bit since last time.
If it's a gangster movie,
it needs something strong.
but this one...
the storyline's just bland.
Plus, there's no gangster
in this gangster movie.
Look for something else.
Sir.
I'll change it...
one last time.
I'm doing real interviews
with some gangsters right now.
I'll make it
realistic this time.
You just wait, motherfuckers.
I'll make something huge.
Hey, you found this place.
Yeah, it wasn't hard.
What's up with you these days?
I couldn't get a hold of you...
Are you busy these days?
Yeah,
the business is busy.
I'm sorry
about the other day.
Things just happen and shit...
Yeah,
I saw what happened.
Man,
what was that fight over?
You saw?
Just the usual territory fight.
Ah!
Man, that was some action.
It's my first time
seeing gangsters fight.
Did you get hurt
or anything?
I'm fine. So what is it that
you had to see me so urgently
Oh, that...
I'll tell you as we go.
Go where?
Where are we going?
You'll see once
we get there.
Where are you taking me...
It was such a spectacle
when the fat boy
got smashed.
We couldn't go that way since
then thanks to this son of a bitch.
That's right. Byung-doo,
you used to be so athletic.
Don't you remember?
Our class won that relay
run because of him.
Yeah, that's right.
Man, it's so good to
see you again.
I know.
Yeah, come out more often.
Yeah, okay.
Help Min-ho with his film too.
It's about time
he made something.
Hey, stop.
Who knows?
When he becomes famous
maybe he'll bring some
gorgeous actresses with him.
As if I'll have time
for you guys.
You arrogant son
of a bitch.
Whatever!
Hey, Min-ho,
I think
I'd better go in now.
Why? Stay a little longer.
Hyun-joo will come soon.
This prick bought it.
I guess he did.
It's a bet!
He's betting two hundred
for whoever finished
- the pie in 20 seconds.
- Really?
20 seconds?
Anyone can do that!
Whoever eays it
can take it.
You'd better keep your word.
- OK, Two hundred!
- You guys, join us.
Alright, bring on the pie.
- Byung-doo, try it.
- Hey, let's do it.
One, two, start!
Stop!
Who's finished it?
For real?
Open your mouth.
What the...
Byung-doo, take it.
Use it to pay for the drinks.
Hey, Hyun-joo!
Sorry, sorry.
Come sit over here.
Why are you so late?
Work ended late today.
You're always late.
- You'd better pay penalty.
- Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You know how long
Byung-doo waited for you?
Hey, Byung-doo.
Hey, it's been a long time.
It's so good to see you.
You still look the same.
Really?
What do you mean?
She's aged.
You wanna die?
So when are you going to
get married, Hyun-joo?
Hey, ask me after
you find me a man first.
Hey, you know how much
Byung-doo missed you?
Really?
Hey, I never said that.
Why not?
I missed him too.

Run in.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Hey, what the hell is
wrong with your driving?
I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off.
Don't you know any better
not to drive when you're sleepy?
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the damage.
- Let me get your name card.
- Yes, sure.
Aren't you attorney PARK?
You know me?
Yeah, I'm OH Jong-soo.
Don't you remember me?
OH Jong-soo?
Have we met before?
I saw you at the Rainbow.
Why don't you eat
some food as well.
The food here is
really good.
Yes, boss.
You look healthier
than before.
Really?
I'm working out more,
running two extra kilometers.
I must live long enough to
spend all that money I have.
Of course, boss.
How's getting ready for
moving to the new place?
It's going well,
thanks to you.
I got your back from now on
so let's work as team.
I have this business plan
that I might need
your help in.
I'm at your service, boss.
I willing to work hard.
But you know...
it wont' be easy settling things
with Sang-chul.
I know, boss.
Good.
This case worked out well
thanks to you.
- Let's drink to it.
- Yes, boss.
And, one more thing...
This never happened.
Not a soul will find out.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I know, boss.
So it's ten in total?
Let's see what you have.
Flush.
Hold your horses.
A full house.
Hey, good timing.
Go get some money.
They were meeting together.
The fucking son of a bitch.
He dares to leave me out?
I think Byung-doo did
attorney PARK as you said.
I'm sorry it's been so long.
How's your health?
It's just so-so.
I need to cope with it.
Still,
you'll get better soon.
Mom, remember how he
used to be so considerate.
I told him not to come, but
he kept on insisting
that he wanted to see you.
Really? thank you.
I heard you've become
a filmmaker?
Yes.
I'm so happy for you.
Poor Byung-doo couldn't
finish school
because of me.
Mom, you don't need to say
that here.
Byung-doo's
far better offthan I am.
You've got yourself
a good son.
You'd better tell some good
stories to our director here.
Yes, boss.
Tell him everything.
Ask them anything
you want to know.
Okay.
If you wantjuicy stuff,
ask him.
He's had it rough.
He can stab you
while smiling.
Jong-soo boss cried last night
watching a TV drama.
You fucking ass,
shut up!
Hey, watch it.
We have a guest here.
Sorry boss.
Oh, it's ok.
Jong-soo, what is
that tattoo of? It's interesting.
It's a forget-me-not.
Boss waters it sometimes
like this...
Boss,
my tattoo is prettier.
Hong-man's been watching
over big boss's gang and says
Young-pil went down to
Young-gwang today.
To Young-gwang?
Yeah, he didn't meet anyone
in particular.
Just looked around.
Something's fishy.
When's Young-pil going in?
I heard after the big boss's
sister's wedding.
Myung-goo, what do you want
to do when you climb up in rank.
I want to find a good sponsor
and make a fortune.
I wish to buy
my own apartment someday.
Myung-goo and Hong-man
are petite.
What made
you wanna be a gangster?
Why boss,
size dosen't matter.
The days offattening up eating
dog food and shit are over.
These days, you can't
survive like that.
You need brains and
skills these days.
Gangsters need to study
to read documents.
Excuse me.
- Yes, how may I help you?
Byung-doo!
Wow that's a lot
of books there.
You read all of it?
Just the titles.
Hey, what happened last time?
You left in the middle of it.
Oh, something came up.
Hey, so how long have
you been working here?
7~8 years.
Oh really?
Your legs must hurt
from standing all day.
Well, that's how it is.
So, how's your mother?
She's doing well.
I remember she used to cook
red bean noodles for me.
I crave it sometimes.
You have good memory.
Come over whenever
you crave it.
Hey, so you're not
dating anyone?
Nope.
And you?
Me? I was too busy
thinking of you.
Yeah right.
I'm serious.
Anyway, it's really
nice to see you again.
Yeah.
Hey, I heard about
what you do for living.
What did you hear?
That I'm a gangster?
- Yeah, Young-pil.
- Boss wants to see you.
- What?
- He said right now.
- Right now?
- Yes, boss.
- I see.
- Hurry up.
Alright.
You know what?
I need to get back to work.
Yeah. Hey, is it okay
if I came by once in a while?
No, why don't you call me
when you're around here.
Why?
I don't want my friends
to see me at work.
Alright.
- OK, bye.
- Bye.
- Come on in.
- You asked for me, boss?
Here's
the wedding invitation.
Wow.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Sit down.
It's sad sending her off.
- So have you heard?
- Heard what?
Attorney PARK's missing.
Who?
Attorney PARK!
You met him
in front ofthat karaoke.
Cops came by because ofthat.
Don't know why they're linking
me with his absence.
What gangster in his sane
mind would do that?
Knowing it would kill
the whole organization.
Don't you agree?
Of course, boss.
By the way, go to Young-gwang
this weekend after the wedding.
Young-gwang?
Do you remember
Mr. JANG?
Go collect money from him.
Yes, boss.
Since that game room
didn't work out for you,
you can use half of it.
It'll be enough for you
and your boys too.
Thanks, boss.
I kind of let you guys
drift alone, didn't I?
It's hard with all these boys
looking up to me.
I miss those days
when we used to drought it together.
Yes, boss.
I want you to tell me if you feel
like you're being mistreated.
You're the only one
I have left,
with Young-pil's
going in soon.
He's done attorney PARK
Yes.
Then you should finish him off
and teach Mr. HWANG a lesson.
I don't want to shed blood
before the wedding.
He's going after
the wedding
so go after him
and work quietly
Yes, boss.
This is melting in my mouth.
Boss, you should try some.
- Yeah, you go ahead eat.
- Okay.
This is for you guys.
Where is this from?
Get yourselves a new suit.
Thank you boss!
Let me ask you something.
What is a family?
What does a family
mean to you?
Um, a family is like this,
like us, boss.
A family is a mouth that
eays from the same table.
One mouth, two...
three, four...
five, six...
seven including myself
We are all one mouth.
- Understood?
- Yes, boss.
Then, what about the asshole
that wanys to eat alone?
He's not a part ofthe family.
He's a fucking stranger.
Am I right?
Yes, boss!
♪ Echo waves reach everyone
♪ A land that split our youth
♪ Life is a turning water mill
♪ so follow the wind and the cloud
I think the boss knows.
Then we should hurry, boss.
It has to be done anyway.
We could get fucked before
them ifwe wait too long.
Thank you.
Boss, nice to see you.
- How are you, boss?
- Ah, welcome.
- Congratulations, boss.
- Welcome. Thanks.
They said it might rain,
but I'm glad it isn't, boss.
Yeah, I know.
You must be missing her
already, boss.
It's about time she
got married.
Everyone, look over here.
One, two...
Thank you.
Would the friends
ofthe groom
and the bride come out
to take a picture
at the front ofthe aisle.
How's the food?
Thanks a lot!
- Boss.
- Yeah.
The car is ready.
Yeah, escort them
to the airport
- and drive safely.
- Yes, boss.
Hey, Mr. NOH,
come over here.
Man, it's so hard
to see you around.
Yeah, long time no see.
Here, sit down.
I need to greet
the guesys first.
- Have a drink before you go.
- Man, I can't resist.
The groom looks smart.
I heard
he's from a good family.
So he's a fair match
for my sister.
Of course, boss...
Well, I'm heading off
to the airport,
so I'll join you
when I get back.
It's the least
I can do for my boss.
You son of a bitch.
Alright.
Okay, see you later.
So how many years
are you going in for?
Why don't you take all that
money you're managing...
and leave the country
for a few years?
Boss, you wanna die
here or leave?
Hey, you have a drink too.
Hold on.
Boss, it seems there are
more guesys than expected.
I know. Hey, nice suit.
Thanks. It's a special day.
Shouldn't you be getting
married soon too?
Not anytime soon, boss.
So when shall I visit
Mr. JANG?
Huh?
Oh yeah, go tomorrow.
Mr. JANG isn't going to be
easy to collect money from.
That's why appointed
you to do the job.
Isn't that yours?
Oh, yes.
I don't know what to do
with that gang.
Don't worry boss,
I'll handle it.
- Okay.
- Long time no see, boss.
Who are you?
I met you at the funeral
last time.
I'm with the Rotary gang,
boss.
Oh, you're under Sang-chul.
How are you?
Doing great, boss.
Did you enjoy the food, boss?
Wedding food's always
the same.
Then drink as much as you want.
We've prepared enough of it.
I guess Sang-chul boss is
doing pretty well.
So many families came.
Sang-chul's always in
good terms with everyone.
His boys are
pretty smart too.
I heard someone's going in
because ofthe game room.
Young-pil's
supposed to go in.
When is he going in?
Right after the wedding,
boss.
Is Sang-chul treating
your family well too?
Of course, boss.
I see.
Yeah.
Good.
Let's finish it.
- Are we set?
- Yup.
- Okay, let's go.
- Yup.
I'll go with the driver
and start unpacking.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Sun-ok might
get lost later so wait
for her at the bus stop.
Okay.
Let's go, mom.
Wait a minute.
Let me finish cleaning up.
You don't need to do that.
Of course I do.
One must clean
after his place.
By the way, why are the cops
coming for you these days?
Why are you being
questioned?
What have you done?
I wish you'd stop
living like that
and start leading
a normal life.
Can you stop.
And don't worry.
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'll find that book for you.
Could you come this way?
It's your book!
Would you want me to reserve
the other book for you?
Yes, please.
We'll call you
when it arrives.
Thank you.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
- This is all I could find.
- Thanks.
- Your boyfriend?
- No.
- He's good looking.
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
- Try this book.
- Okay.
So if I read this, it'll help
us with our teamwork?
That's what the title implies.
Sounds nice.
I should buy more of it.
Hey, let's have dinner
tonight.
Dinner?
- You're buying?
- Of course.
You'd better treat me
to something delicious.
Miss KANG,
what are you doing here?
Customers are waiting.
He's a customer too.
I'll be there soon.
Right now!
You're not eating any more?
I'm full.
I was going to treat you
to something fancier.
Why noodles?
I just felt like it.
It's good.
By the way, what was
that at the bookstore?
He was an ass.
Don't mind him.
Hey, why did you buy
so many books?
They're for my employees.
I have an office now.
What kind of office?
I'm starting a real
estate business.
Really? I heard you're helping
Min-ho with his movie.
I'm not much of a help.
I just told him some stories
of how we live.
Hyun-joo, do you remember?
Remember what?
How we won first place
in the relay race at school?
Yeah,
of course I remember.
We used to stay
after school to practice.
It was a lot offun.
Yeah
We used to go to Min-ho's
place for noodles afterwards.
Yeah, we did.
Byung-doo.
Don't get offended
by what I'm about to say...
but I still can't believe
you're doing that for living.
What?
I can't picture you
as a gangster knowing
how you used to be.
Hyun-joo. Gangster's just a label.
I'm not as bad as you think.
You'll find out as you
see me more often.
I guess Hyun-joo thinks
of you a lot,
sending you this.
What kind oftree is this?
It doesn't have branches.
It's a Lucky Tree.
It rarely blossoms
but if it does, something good's
supposed to happen.
I hope it blossoms
so you can make a fortune.
A Lucky Tree.
Man, she's a woman ofwit.
- Hey, Hippo.
- Yes, boss.
Take special care ofthat.
If you let it die,
you die with it.
Yes, boss.
Hey, Byung-doo.
You must've landed
a good sponsor.
No, some boss helped me out.
Oh yeah, that boss
has a daughter
who wanys to be
an actress.
Can you cast her
for your movie?
Why not.
If it's your request,
I'll meet her next time.
Do you need help?
You have something schique and
comfortable at the same time?
What size does
the lady wear?
Try to find one
this length.
- I'm sorry?
- This length.
Let's have a talk with dinner.
Why not?
Here are in front of company.
Let's have a talk.
I said no.
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong with you?
You can't do this to me.
You're not supposed
to do this anymore.
Not do what?
Hyun-joo, let's start again.
I said I'll try harder.
Does your wife know
you're still doing this?
Why are you mentioning her?
This is about us.
I don't want to talk with you.
Give me my purse.
Why are you avoiding me?
Give it back to me.
You can't leave until
we're done talking.
Give it back.
- Let's talk this over.
- Hyun-joo.
Hey man, she said
she wanys to go.
What?
Who is this?
I'm Hyun-joo's friend.
A friend? So what?
Byung-doo, let's go.
Give me my purse.
Oh... so there was a reason...
All that was for him?
- Hey man.
- Hey man?
Can't you see I have something
to discuss with Hyun-joo?
Discuss what?
She said no.
It's okay, let's go.
Hyun-joo.
Wait in my car.
Go to my car.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Give me the purse.
Give it to me!
You son of a bitch...
Hey, hold right there!
I said hold right there!
Fucking son of a bitch!
You motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!
What's wrong?
- Let me go.
- What did I do wrong?
- Was it that bad what I did?
- What?
You saw what happened.
He asked for it.
I'm sorry
if it scared you.
But I'm not sorry for him.
Don't come to see me
anymore.
What?
I don't like gangsters.
So don't come to see me.
What are you saying?
You scare me.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Hey, you can't sit there
forever.
Go home now.
I said
someone's coming.
Nobody's coming.
Shit, just wait and see.
Hey, Byung-doo,
Byung-doo.
Man, you're so fucking heavy.
Why did you drink so much?
- Min-ho...
- What?
Shit...
Why is life so fucking hard?
What are you talking about?
Life sucks.
Hey, you really
not gonna eat?
No.
I'm staying over tonight.
It's messy like your place
so make yourself at home.
I remember when I used to
deliver for your restaurant.
Your mom used to hate seeing
you hanging out with me.
Really?
The owner's son
and the delivery boy,
both pathetic.
Man, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said such a thing.
No, it's okay.
It's true what you said.
Did you find the picture
we talked about last time?
The picture? Yeah.
I was going to give it
to you.
Isn't Hyun-joo really cute?
Hey, how are things going
between you guys?
Min-ho,
do I scare you too?
Why? Did someone say
you're scary?
I...
I never regretted being
a gangster but today,
I feel shitty.
You're really weird today.
Did something happen?
Just thought I shouldn't
be doing things I was doing.
I tried everything
to make money...
doing dirty work
with sashimi knife.
Still, nothing changed
about this shitty life.
I don't know what happened
but you're not the only one.
I've been living like this
for 3 years to make a movie.
Hey, did you really use
a sashimi knife?
Why?
It sounds so unreal.
May because you're my friend.
When did you get
that scar on your shoulder?
This? You know...
when I was fighting over
that game room.
Ah...
Is that scar from a knife?
Yeah.
I wonder what
it's like being stabbed.
Have you ever
stabbed anyone?
I'm no different
from the rest.
What does it feel like?
Stabbing?
Feels like shit.
You're not
yourselfwhen you do it.
Yeah.
I can't imagine it.
That's why you shouldn't look
into their eyes...
If you do, it will haunt you
for the rest of your life.
Nobody will understand...
I can't get it out
of my mind.
Hey, who did you stab?
What's wrong
with you today?
This is the bird's eye view
ofthe apartment complex.
The total sales profit
will be around 451 .8 billion won
and the cost of land,
construction, and selling...
All those will be replaced
by beautiful apartmenys.
A shopping mall over there
and a subway line there.
Imagine the scale of money
selling 1 ,500 uniys.
We'll get
at least five hundred
if everything
works out well.
Five hundred uniys?
I can't imagine it, boss.
It could be more.
But it won't be easy
driving out the locals.
The landlords probably heard
about the development by now.
They'll expect compensation.
You think you can handle it?
Yes, I'll do it, boss.
Good.
If you help me
dig those grounds,
I'll give you 50 uniys.
- Really, boss?
- Of course.
I'm here because of you.
I'll make sure it happens.
Your scenario was good.
Why didn't you do it sooner?
Pardon me?
I guess all
those interviews paid off.
The characters seemed real
and the story's good.
Oh, really?
- Let's do it.
- What?
Let's get the actors together
and start tomorrow.
Ah, yeah.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

Lady, sell it.
Shit, you're holding up
our construction business.
Should we come by
at night and bury her?
Boss, let's do that.
I know a good mountain
for digging.
Things will only get worse.
We'll pay you some extra.
How many times do I need
to tell you. I can't sell it.
I lived here for 30 years and
it's all I've got for my sons
So your second son is
a senior in high school?
Excuse me?
Boss, we couldn't find
the owners ofthe five houses.
They're probably hiding.
I think the Serpenys' got them.
I guess they want a part
in this too.
The matter's serious
if it's the Serpenys though.
My boys will find those
five landlords soon.
As long as we find one,
the rest will come out easy.
Do it quietly.
An all-out war isn't easy.
- Yes, boss.
- Your guest has arrived.
- Hey, Min-ho. Come here.
- Hello, director KIM. Welcome.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to ask you to come
when you must be so busy.
It's no problem.
I heard a lot about you
from Byung-doo.
He seems very proud of you.
Really?
How's it coming along?
We'll go
into shooting soon.
First of all,
congratulations.
And thanks for casting
my daughter.
She's good for the role.
Byung-doo helped me
it's the least I could do.
It'd better be a big hit.
Thanks.
You can count on me, boss.
Make a blockbuster, Min-ho.

Do you know where
Ms. KANG Hyun-joo is?
She didn't come to
work today.
I'm a friend of hers.
Could you give this
to her for me?
She's sick,
so she's taking some days off.
Really?
Hyun-joo! Open the door.
I said open the door!
Come out!
Open the door.
You'd better open the door.
I'm gonna break in.
Hyun-joo!
Is she okay?
The doctor
will be here soon.
Why didn't you call home
if you were this sick?
I must say this is excellent
although I made it.
I used to get beat to get
the recipe right for this.
Try it.
Tryjust a bite then,
for my sake.
Why are you crying?
Eat so you can recover.

Won't it be nice to see
happens for a few days?
Where's are they?
Did we get everything?
Things got complicated,
boss.
Why?
I was just working
on those five
and it seems Serpent's
got the papers himself.
What?
Serpent has them?
Fucking son of a bitch.
What shall we do, boss?
Kill them, until they tell
you where Serpent is.
Yes, boss.
Who are you?
Mr. KIM, it's not polite to
mess with others' business.
Who the fuck are you?
Your mother seemed ill.
Who are you?
And isn't it dangerous
after dark
for a pretty girl
like your sister?
Byung-doo, what's wrong?
What's going on?
Sun-ok, hurry up and pack.
We're leaving right now.
Mom says she's not going.
What's happening?
Stay at uncle's place
for a few days.
Where's Byung-sik?
He hasn't come home
in a couple of days.
That son of a bitch.
Hurry,
what are you doing?
I'm not leaving my house.
What did you do this time?
Just listen to me this once.
I can't deal with
this anymore.
First it was cops,
now we have to hide
from gangsters?
We can manage on our own,
go hide by yourself.
Your bad example messed
up Byung-sik as well.
Shit!
You think I come here
because I want to?
Who's gonna take care
of Byung-sik and Sun-ok?
Stop shouting at mom.
I won't ask you to take
care of us.
So get out!
Okay, I'll leave
So do whatever you want.
Where are they, boss?
Call Jong-soo
and tell him
to send some boys over
to my house.
Yes, boss.
Yes!
We'll take care ofthem.
We'll bury them as soon as
we find out where they are.
Okay, boss.
What did the boss say?
To finish
everything tonight.
Okay.
Since they love land so much,
we'll bury them.
We'll do what they did to
our boys, when we find them.
Of course.
Can't believe we're going
through all this trouble for Axe.
He shouldn't have
got caught by them.
Boss, won't we get something
for rescuing all ofthem?
I'm sure we will as soon
as the boss geys
things settled.
You know, Axe is
a fucking psycho.
Remember
when we went to
collect money
from Royal Billiards?
Axe forgot to bury him
afterwards.
Lighter, lighter.
When we went back
the tide water had
already reached right
below his eyes.
He could've died.
Isn't he a dumb ass, boss?
It geys even better.
When we got there,
he looking up at me
with these sad
pleading eyes.
Then all
of a sudden a stream of
water shot out of nowhere.
You know what it was?
Eui-jung was pissing on him.
Isn't that something?
He must've been pissing
in his panys himself.
I'm sure he was, boss.
All those Mokpo bitches are
in the past, boss.
You lying bitch...
What?
What the...
Stop the car!
Motherfucker!
Where's Serpent?
Stay still, bitch.
Hurry, get him in the car.
This is Serpent's.
These are the rest
ofthe landlords.
The land is open
for construction now.
Good job.
You're ruthless.
What about the Serpenys?
They're resolved for good?
Of course, boss.
After the authorization,
we're set for good.
Don't forget
about my share, boss.
Of course,
you'll get your share.
- Cut
- It's a cut.
It's very different
from real life...
I know, boss.
Practice!
Everything nice and all,
but actions seem
too sophisticated.
Can't we get it a bit
more realistic?
Realistic? How?
Maybe you can take out
thatjumping round kick.
You said it was okay
on the first round.
You should've said it
earlier then.
Now we have to change
the whole routine.
This just isn't the type
of action I was thinking of...
OK then, no jumping round kick.
What else?
I don't know what you want
so tell me specifically.
- Min-ho.
- Yes.
He's the martial arts
choreographer?
Yeah, why?
Hi, I was just watching.
I'm sorry to butt in,
but the fight
doesn't seem real.
Min-ho, real gangsters
don't fight like this.
Hey, Jong-soo!
Come over here.
- Hurry up.
- Yes, boss.
Stand right here.
You see.
A punch should
always fly low.
Keep it low and give it
a sting at the end.
Like this.
This is how you do it.
I'm fine but the crew seems
to feel a bit uncomfortable.
I guess I made a mistake.
I was only trying to help.
I know.
They're all really sensitive
right now with stress.
Yeah, then I'll head off.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you soon
When it's all over.
Yeah, good luck with the rest
ofthe shooting.
Min-ho!
Make something
with a real Gangster spirit.
See you.
You're off early today.
It's been a while.
How were you?
You feel better now?
I'm much better now.
Good.
You don't seem
happy to see me.
People are watching,
hurry, take it.
Actually, I went the book shop
several times to see you.
But I couldn't say hi
to you.
Thought you'd feel
uncomfortable.
But I'm glad you
look better.
Oh yeah, thank you
for the other day.
You're a good cook.
Yeah,
then get sick again.
So I can cook
for you again.
How do you like
this place?
It's really nice to be out
after working inside all day.
It's like another world,
another life in there.
I'll take you to
a better place next time.
I saw you wearing
new shoes.
Does it fit?
How did you know my size?
Just an eye measurement.
I'm always receiving things
from you.
What is it?
What's the event?
Nothing... I just wanted to
celebrate something.
Enjoy your cake...
What did you want to
celebrate?
Remember you sent me
a Lucky tree?
It blossomed today.
Really?
That's really rare.
Yeah I know, but it did.
If something good really
happens, it's because of you.
I had fun today.
Getting some fresh air...
You're a good conversationist
and smiled a lot too today.
You helped me.
I haven't had such
a good time in a while.
- Really?
- Yeah!
Yeah. Next time,
I'm buying.
Cool.
Don't you invite me
for a cup of coffee?
Coffee?
It's too late tonight.
I'll make it
for you next time.
Okay.
I can't believe
it's time to go already.
Drive safely.
And thanks for the flowers.
Yup.
Hyun-joo!
Hold on.
Hyun-joo,
can I like you?
You still hate me?
No, it's just...
I'm not sure...
Hyun-joo, if you want,
I can quit being a gangster.
To tell you the truth,
I've never liked anyone but you.
I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.
Congratulations.
Seems like a hit.
- Hey, thanks.
- Min-ho.
- You're here.
- You did a greatjob.
Everybody's talking
about how good the movie it.
It's good.
It's a good piece ofwork.
Really? You must work
with me next time then.
Thank you.
Director!
Hey, Ji-ae
- Hello, Director.
- Hi.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for coming.
Did Ji-ae cause you trouble?
No, she was great.
Director,
I think it's a hit.
Everyone's
talking about it.
Yeah.
I wish you best of luck.
By the way,
didn't you invite Byung-doo?
I tried calling him
but he wouldn't pick up.
Right, he's so busy these
days with work.
I see.
Let's have a drink sometime.
Sure.
Have more.
I hope you like it.
It tastes exactly like
when I had it in elementary.
I'm glad.
Take some home with you.
She's made plenty.
It's not worth taking home.
Hyun-joo, come over often.
Okay.
A tip for my sister-in-law,
it tastes better
with salt and sugar.
You're embarrassing her.
It's my wishful thinking.
Byung-doo,
you'd like that too.
You've become
a different person ever
since you've been
dating her.
No I haven't.
Your brother
always talks about you.
How pretty
and smart you are.
Really?
I'm so happy
you're with him.
He has a good heart.
Always bringing
all sorts of medicine.
You need to get well soon.
Yes, boss.
Where are you?
I'm having dinner
with my family.
So oblivious...
Pardon?
Are you alright?
What kind of driving is that?
I'm sorry,
I had a small drink...
I'm sorry.
What?
You're driving drunk?
Let me see your license.
I don't have one.
Then let me see your ID.
I don't have that either.
No ID?
What kind of person
would drive without a license?
- You know who I am?
- I sure do.
Hello, attorney Choi!
Long time no see.
Who did you do it to?
Go ahead and tell me.
Min-ho.
I took my boss.
Why?
There must've been
a reason for taking him.
You wouldn't do that to
your boss for no reason.
You can't tell anyone
about this...
How far does he know?
I didn't mention anything
about you.
Trust me, boss.
Are you out of your mind?
How could you tell him?
I'm sorry.
I don't know
what else to say.
Why did Sang-chul
end up that way?
What will happen if your friend
went about telling everyone?
He won't do such a thing,
boss.
How can you be sure?
You did it.
You clean it up.
Look over here, good.
Okay, once more.
Now, hold your fisys,
pose like a gangster.
Smile a little more.
A little more, good!
Your characters are very real.
Did you interview
real gangsters?
I watched a lot
of gangster movies
like "THE GODFATHER" and "SCARFACE".
I'm sorry,
I should've called you.
Why did you do that?
I trusted you
when I told you that.
You shouldn't have done it
if you considered me your friend.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
before, but...
Sorry?
What ifthis ruins me?
You don't give a fuck,
do you?
Hey, listen to me.
Listen to what?
I thought hard about it.
I figured it
would be harmless.
Everyone knows about the case
and anyone could've don
You've watched it too.
It's not about you.
I made it up.
Think about it.
Kim Mim-ho.
Okay, let's say
it was my mistake.
But gangsters can do anything
to cover their mistakes.
You wondered what it'd be
like being stabbed.
Let me sayjust one thing.
Shut up for the rest of
your life. Okay?
Can you do that?
Yes.
I'll take it to my grave.
If something happens,
I'm not going down alone.
Got it?
You trust him?
I don't.
He even made it
into a movie.
I said I got it under control.
Stop talking about it.
And start gathering boys
for the model house.
If you can't do it
because he's your friend,
I'll do it.
What?
Leave it up to me.

It's my business
so you can stay out of it!
Boss, this isn't
just about you.

on the line.
Why are you covering for
that fucking bastard?
Will you take care of us,
ifwe all get fucked up?
You son of a bitch!
Shit.
I'll fucking shut you up.
Didn't I say
I got it under control?
Don't you ever mention that
in front of me again.
Long time no see, boss.
Stop.
Boss... how could you?
Unlike our boss,
I don't know you very well,
Ain't that so you pussy.
Sorry to worry you, boss.
I got everything
under control now.

- Yes, boss.

So be prepared.
Yes, boss.
Our boss saved you
this time.
But we'll be watching you.
Better keep
your mouth shut.
We're on the same boat now.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your help.
It's doing well.
Yes, I'm glad.
What was the competition rate
for sales contract until yesterday?
It was 50 to 1

So what is your plan?
You're gonna hide forever?
I'll clean up the mess
since I caused it.
I'll take Min-ho.
What?
I'll finish him and
I'll leave the country too.
He's big now.
Things can get more complicated.
I can do it, boss.
Just make sure
you give me my share.
It's all my family
can depend on.
Just in case things go wrong,
I won't mention your name.
The movie broke the record
and sold five million tickeys.
Thank you again.
Now let me introduce
director KIM Min-ho.
Hello, I'm KIM Min-ho,
the director ofthe movie.
I'm happy to meet all of you.
Thank you
for watching our movie.
There were some difficult
momenys in making this movie,
but I never dreamed a day
like this would come.
- Yeah, Jong-soo.
- We are arrived.
I'll be right there.
It was crazy
going into that theater.
I'm glad we hired
those bodyguards.
Thanks detective!
Why do you look so down?
You should cheer up on a day
like this.
Let's have a drink.
Come on, director!
Let's have a drink.
I don't want to ruin this,
but I should leave now.
- You can't leave!
- No you can't, director!
We're going clubbing
after this.
Come on!
I feel ashamed...
Leting you guys down...
I should've
listened to you.
That was my biggest mistake.
What good is it to regret
the past, boss?
We just need to try
solving it.
After this, while I'm gone,
you guys live quietly
for 2 years.
And be a good boss
to the boys while I'm gone.

How about
my past love story?
Excuse me?
You see, I've had a hell of
a drama in my love life.
Oh, I see...
Let's meet often to talk
about it.
If you like the story,
you don't need to worry
about the money.
Since you're good
at making up stories,
I think you'll do it well.
Oh, no, no, really...
But don't make it too similar,
my wife might kill me.
Yup, a fiction will always
be a fiction.

- How are you, boss?
Good. Come on in.
What are you waiting for?
Bring them in!

They're important guest,
so treat them
as you best clienys.
Of course.
You know Jong-soo?
Yes.
You know the director?
Yes, boss.
I know him well.
Since you won't be in Seoul
for a while, drink up and enjoy.
Thank you, boss.
And congratulations
for winning the award.
Leys forget the past
and start fresh.
Cheers!
This is one
of my favorite songs.
The lyrics are good.
Hey, Min-ho.
