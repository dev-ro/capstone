Yae-bin, wake up!
It's time to get ready.
Can you get the news?
You guys should go see grandma in hospital.
I'm done.
Aren't you going to finish?
Did you hear me?
Why don't you buy handbags for you and your mother?
You want one too?
Love you, Dad.
Call your grandma, at least.
This slimy thing here is very good for your husband...
A terrible incident happened to a high school girl...
- Hello. - Hi.
- Here. - Oh, don't...
- It's nothing. - Thank you.
Why did you tempt me? Because I'm the boss's daughter?
Of course I love it.
It's Chanel.
Don't worry. Go back to work.
Hey, hey!
My son-in-law bought me
Chanel!
I guess buying out companies is not easy.
Who knew your husband would be so successful!
And how your brother would turn out.
In college he was all labor union, blah blah blah-
Life is ironic.
Using fancy words now?
Guess I'm becoming a Seoulite.
Please don't say they're siblings.
We're siblings.
- What? No way. - It doesn't make sense.
See? I told you!
Thank you.
- When did this start? - She was OK this morning.
Hang on a sec!
HA CHUN-HWA
- Do you need money? - Why are you there?
- Dad gave you this morning. - Why are you there?
If you need money, just ask. Don't sneak like that.
Who says I'm sneaking? I thought you were sleeping!
Is something wrong?
I thought it was a real book!
Is there something wrong?
You're the only one.
At that age, everything's turmoil and a passionate encounter.
She has to sacrifice everything despite her feelings because
she's a mother.
It's just a drama.
You think you grew up without any troubles?
I wasn't a big troublemaker.
No you weren't. You were a huge troublemaker.
They're not gonna kill her, are they?
I only have a month.
- What the hell? - I knew it! I knew it!
Is someone there?
No one?
I'm just looking at you.
I'm just
watching you.
What do doctors say?
Maybe two more months...?
Does it hurt a lot?
Well...
it's like thousands of needles...
drilling you
at the same time.
IM Na-mi!
Why are you still so pretty?
HA Chun-hwa!
You're not bad either for a cancer patient.
Hello?
Tomorrow?
For how long?
Two months?
Alright.
My husband is going on a business trip.
You should go.
I'll visit often. Do you need any help?
Don't worry.
I thought of something!
Tell me.
I miss them.
Who?
Sunny.
I want to see them before I die.
When did you get your checkup?
The other day...
Didn't your uncle die of cancer?
Or was it his wife?
Did you get an insurance sales call?
Bumped into an old friend at the hospital.
Late-stage lung cancer.
You have an old friend?
From high school.
Didn't I tell you that I belonged to a clique?
Honey.
Na-mi.
What!
Shall we try for another baby?
My period has stopped.
Take your pills everyday and be careful.
Yae-bin has hers. This is yours.
I have money.
Spend some time with your friend. She doesn't have much left.
I have to help Yae-bin with her exams.
Take care.
Take care, sir!
Downtown is usually the best route around now.
But today...
Stop cutting in, you fool!
Mr. Bong?
Sorry.
What the...?
I'm sorry.
Wanna get your ass kicked?
Piss off.
Hey guys, Su-mi's here!
Attention!
Bow.
Good morning, teacher?
Whose seat is that?
Chun-hwa went to the toilet.
Jang-mi, please don't talk while sleeping.
You're scaring my baby.
I'm not sleeping.
Are you still bowing, then?
This is a new transfer student, IM...
Na-mi. She's from Beolgyo, Jeolla-do.
It's her first time in Seoul. So be nice to her.
- Okay, Jang-mi? - Yep.
Introduce yourself.
It's nice to meet y'all.
You.
I'm IM Na-mi from New Beolgyo High.
Go sit over there.
Let's see...
The slogan of the month is "anti-communism".
And why are there cigarette butts in girl's high school?
You can't make pretty babies if you smoke.
I trust we don't have smokers in out class.
Attention!
Bow.
Thank you, teacher.
Hey, y'all!
Where's Beolgyo? Oh, the place with cookies?
Let me see. Did you bring cookies for lunch?
I didn't bring lunch.
Give her a break.
Hey, change your seat with that girl over there.
She smells like menstruation.
Teacher told me to sit here.
Listen or you'll regret.
Hey.
Get lost.
- You're gutsy today. - I always had big guts.
Hey, chill out guys.
Aren't you going? Some choices are important...
- What the f--! - Get your ass off now!
I'm sorry.
Who's this?
New kid.
- Where's she from? - Beolgyo.
The town of cockies. She didn't bring lunch.
- What's her name? - IM Na-mi.
- Na-mi? Just like the singer? - Yep.
I'm Chun-hwa. Just like the singer, HA Chun-hwa.
- Nice to meet you, Na-mi. - Nice to meet ya too!
Do I look weird?
Ok. it's weird.
Stop staring.
Let's go eat!
Happy lunch time, Jinduk! I'm your DJ KIM,
with perfect songs to assist your digestion.
The first song is by Cyndi Lauper.
Girls Just Want to Have Fun.
Hey "singer" buddy, let's go have lunch.
You're eating again, fatso?
Just a bun.
Who's that?
New kid, Na-mi. This is HWANG Jin-hee.
Her dad's a Korean Lit. prof, but she majors in swearwords.
Bitch's sayin' shit.
- Where you from? - Beolgyo, Jeolla-do.
Do people there really swear a lot?
Why, you wanna go study?
- Yup. - Bye.
Hey, Geum-ok! Four more salad buns!
Ok, four more!
Geum-ok is the only child of Dentist Seo.
She's a bookworm with a "big stick."
What's a "big stick"?
It's healthy to let out anger.
Chun-hwa!
Look at that. A walking poodle.
Let's go.
How many bottles of perm lotion did you use?
Guess you don't want double eyelid tapes?
You're so pretty!
Are you new? Nice to meet you!
I'm the future Miss Korea.
Go read a book, airhead.
- Stop being bitchy. - Whatever.
When you're a Miss Korea, double eyelids at your salon, huh?
Of course.
Where's that Su-ji bitch?
Smoking for diet.
This.
Remember the pretty girl in our class?
- She's our possy, too. - Salad buns are here!
Yeah!
What's up with that ribbon?
Are you the new kid? Hi, I'm Geum-ok.
Wow, what are those shoes?
- They're "Specs"! - What's "Specs"'?
Why's my daughter so quiet?
You're in good school thanks to dad's boss.
Did you make many pals?
Stop talkin' to me. I needn't use the dialect.
You don't use dialect. You sound like a Seoul kid.
Mom, nobody wears "Specs". Only Nike or Pro-specs.
And Jordache jeans...
You know how many hours some kids have to work in factories
to buy a pair of shoes?
Of course she doesn't know.
That's the problem, Ma.
As the new ruling class, we workers need to stand up
against the Fascist hegemony, and the Yankee capitalist.
Dad, you need to stop workin' for the dictator like a slave.
Slave?
Employee.
You asshole.
Make your own money if you don't want mine.
But if you want my money,
shut up and just go to school.
Don't do anything stupid.
- Dad! - Shut up.
Life is short and revolution ls forever.
Fuckin' sap sucker! Who's sayin' life's short?
Fuck that filthy mouth filled with whistledickin' shit.
No blamin' the bitches for playin' the game.
It doesn't matter. Y'all's gotta make babes when y'all's 18.
Sis, give me more soup.
Duty student?
Duty student?
Read it.
- Excuse me... - You can go to the toilet after.
I think it's unfair to always pick on the duty student.
Okay. Sit.
Then how about student #12?
I think your double eyelids are unfair.
It's not good for my baby.
Sit.
Na-mi.
Deung Hwa Ga Chin.
It's good to have a candlelight near
It means good time to study.
Na-mi, you were a top student in your old school.
And won many awards in art contests.
Be quiet!
Do you want to go to an art school?
I'm not sure.
Come and get the art contest application form after class.
Okay.
Jang-mi should come too.
I'll make you triple eyelids.
Ma'am?
How come you didn't age?
Did you get a plastic surgery?
You look the same too.
I'm going to be a grandma next month.
Got pregnant before marriage. It's a new trend.
Hey, you come here. You changed your eyes!
Let me see. Close your eyes.
They look nice. Go on.
- Thank you. - Ah, right.
Jang-mi also came to visit.
She left her name card with me...
WOORI LIFE INSURANCE
Look at this.
Looks good, huh?
Mrs. Kwak, much better than the last month.
And Mrs. Kim, you need to try harder than this.
Everybody applause. Mrs. Koh is the sales queen of the month!
Mrs. Kim...
- Mrs. Kim Jang-mi? - Yes.
- You know what I'll say. - Yes.
Try harder.
I will.
You put too much effort into your eyelids.
It's unfair to pick on me like that.
I think this is unfair.
Stop laughing. This isn't funny.
Next is Mrs...
This is KIM Jang-mi speaking.
Haven't seen you for 25 years and you're already dying.
You bitch.
Do you have life insurance?
Who would've guessed that I'd end up selling insurance?
My husband lost all our money on business.
Good thing you got divorced.
Still, how can he not show up? Your husband.
With no kids, we're as good as strangers.
Aren't you lonely, though?
I was completely consumed with work.
Now I look back, I guess I was.
Hey, insurance lady, don't have a hot guy for me?
I could use some scorching love affair before I pass.
I'm loaded and terminal. Not a bad deal, huh?
Right back atcha, bitch!
Let's find them. Chun-hwa's paying for the fee.
Don't you miss them?
I need to take care of my family.
What, they can't take care of themselves?
Don't bother. I'll find them alone.
How?
It takes about a month to find
four people, no matter where they live.
And you already know the price.
My wife shrunk my shirt.
We also accept credit cards...
Excuse me.
I told you to stay inside!
He found me and my husband
when we were hiding from our creditors.
Oh, the memories...
You like that?
Anyway, he's good at finding people.
Some acting's necessary in order to make it look
more "natural" because...
Excuse me.
So that was planned acting too?
That's on the back.
- Why didn't you wake me'?! - Eat this. One bite.
Socks!
Get up when I wake you! Here.
Why don't you give me panties too?
You've got diabetes. You gotta eat, Na-mi!
I know! Why didn't you wake me up?
Don't feed her.
The revolutionaries are starving in jail.
Shut up. You're the one who's eating.
Fuck! I don't want to eat.
Mom, grow up!
- Where's my jacket? - Laundry!
Oh gosh.
Move Dad!
She's late again.
Yum, that looks good.
Where's my tool bag?
I'm late!
TOOL BAG
Study this for your exam.
Study this for your exam.
We're done for the day.
Your teacher's having a baby today.
Have a safe weekend. Don't play too hard.
Okay.
Thank you, Jang-mi.
The day has come!
You guys all brought "tools"'?
I only brought this.
You go fight with that, crazy.
What the hell are you doing?
Sorry. I forgot, too.
Shit, this isn't good.
Do we need seven of us to fight with seven of them?
They changed their name to a suckier one.
- Let's get changed first! - Okay, okay! What's that?
- Isn't this so pretty? - Oh my god, that's perfect!
Why are we taking her?
Just to show them we also have seven.
We usually don't fight for real but you can hide at the back.
Let's fight for real! We have many tools!
Do you have anything to eat?
Not really.
Hey, do I look like a walking lunch box to you?
Don't go without returning your shoes, ma'am.
Fuck. They're already here.
Girls' Generation!
HA Chun-hwa.
Why do we have to fight like the tigers of Serengeti?
Learn to share.
Not before you stop stealing from our kids.
Besides it's lions, not tigers, you idiot.
There must be some tigers in Serengeti.
Who's that?
You brought a kid to scare us?
Looks like she wants to pee!
I wasn't gonna bring her, but...
Have you heard of "possession"'?
Of course. Sitting, lying, squatting...
Not position, you fool. "Possession."
What the fuck is that?
Possessed by spirits.
Spirit possession.
She's actually quite famous in her old town.
Look how she's shaking? That's preparing.
Preparing for what?
Ghost.
She doesn't weer socks because she walks on knife every morning.
Don't look her in the eyes.
You'll get possessed.
Yeah, right.
Do you know you always look like a pasta plate?
Why don't you take off your helmet?
Why don't you spit out those ping pong balls first?
Your cheekbones can kill people.
Wow, you crazy bitch.
You have a very filthy mouth.
Not more than your face.
What a special haybag you are.
And you're extra special.
You fucking mother fucker.
You fucking mother fucker sucker!
You horn dog, I'll eat you alive!
Right back atcha!
Go away if you're gonna shake like that.
- You shitface. - You shitface.
Jinx! I'm getting bored.
- You... - What?
- Sh... - Shiznit?
You skanky shiznit twat!
Bitch! That was mine!
Fucking bitches.
You bunch of sap sucking lard buckets!
Fuck that filthy mouth filled with whistledickin' shit.
No blamin' the bitches for playin' the game.
It doesn't matter. Y'all's gotta make babes when y'all's 18.
I should've eaten somthing. Mom, I ain't gonna sleep late.
Granny snorin's too loud, I sleeped no more!
You peckerheads!
Wow, it's already time to watch MTV.
I'm hungry.
I'm just looking at you
I'm just watching you
I can never say I love you
I'm just looking at you
What should I do?
I just go round and round
I want to get a private lesson from your granny too!
I feel so old!
Hey girls!
I think it's time to accept our seventh member.
- Who? - Na-mi.
- Seven's better than six. - Lucky!
Everybody agree to accept Na-mi as our new member?
- Agreed! - Seconded!
Positive, ma'am!
Whatever.
Now that we're seven, let's make a fucking name.
- Cool. - Stop swearing, crazy bitch.
I like "crazy bitch".
Crazy Bitches?
Hey, how's "Wonder Girls?"
Like "Wonder Woman". Never mind.
That's so cheesy.
- And "Crazy Bitches" is creative? - Eat this.
Oh my god.
You scare me, little sis.
- Come in, my parents aren't here. - Hello, Jang-mi.
Wow, Jang-mi.
Hey cutie!
Looking good, my future bride.
When are you gonna study? You don't want to go to college?
Shut up and move.
Su-ji! Keep being pretty like that!
- When I get into a top college... - Top college?
Go memorize the multiplication tables first.
- Do we have noodles? - Make it yourself, you hog.
- Would you like some noodles? - Without egg.
Hello, Jun-ho!
- Hi. - Hi!
- Good to see you! - He said "good to see you!"
New face?
Our newest member.
She's pretty.
- Did you hear that? - Must be your goddamn birthday.
Thank you, Jang-mi.
- I'll smack you in the face. - Back atcha, girlfriend!
Gimme that.
Wow, it's a picture.
- You forgot the eyelid. - No!
This is too pretty.
It's not "potatoes," "potatos."
- It's "potatoes." - It's correct.
- Shut up, idiot. - You hit me?
One day there will be pro video game player.
And portable phones.
- Wouldn't they be heavy? - They'll make small ones.
And portable computers!
You'll write letters and watch radio shows on them.
Watching radio shows?
Of course. It's future.
If I can make that, I'll be rich.
Why, you should say that we'll have to buy water in the future.
Go to your house!
Why would we buy water?
She said we'll have phones that'll take pictures!
- It's on! - Listen, listen!
- I'll remember my friends... - Granny!
Chun-hwa, Su-ji, Jin-hee, Jang-mi, Bok-hee, and Na-mi.
If you could make a name
for our group, we will be good friends.
Forever.
Geum-ok, how about S-U-N-N-Y, "Sunny?"
I hope you like it.
Here 's a song for you girls who are having the
best moments of your lives.
Jo Deok-bae's "In My Dream."
Yesterday I saw you in my dream
I don't even know you
but I can't forget you
Maybe we've met somewhere
Maybe I've forgotten
But I've met you somewhere
I've met you in the fall
I'm afraid I'll wake up
from this dream...
Buy your own.
Hi, Jang-mi.
Jin-hee? The swear queen?
Kids these days are so vulgar.
We were different when we were young.
Reading books and listening to classical music...
You must have been such a cultured kid.
- I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry.
It's alright. Be careful.
Are you Jin-hee?
Na-mi? IM Na-mi?
And you're Jang-mi?
Of course.
Sorry, my voice was too big.
Na-mi, you didn't change a bit.
And Jang-mi, you...
didn't change either.
You changed a lot.
You changed your entire face except the mouth.
I did not! I did my nose because of allergies.
And tiny bit on the eye.
Here you are, my cutie pie!
Have a good time while I go for one more round.
Were you good friends with my wife?
Yeah, we were in the same study group.
How was she in high school? Popular?
Yeah, she was very... elegant.
Elegant curser.
Whenever there was a fight, her mouth was a weapon...
Let us have girls' talk. You should go.
Ok, ok. I'll see you later.
Cutie muffin!
Jang-mi, is there something wrong?
So how are you? How old is your kid?
Seventeen.
You did your breasts? They're watermelons now!
That's so rude.
- Na-mi, what does your husban... - We were never a study group.
Fuck this shit!
Stop it, ok?
Jin-hee.
Don't you wanna meet Chun-hwa?
I can't believe you found me through a detective.
What's wrong with that?
It feels wrong to be followed by a stranger.
We had to find you fast and that was the only way.
You should've found something else.
Do you have their card?
I can't sleep at night if they have my information.
Talk to you later then.
This will Work.
I'll let you know when I find other two.
Can you find one more person, separately?
I only know his name and age.
Well of course... Excuse me.
Oh, you're still here?
Of course I won't tell anyone.
I Will kill you!
Here you are! I think you wrote the plate number wrong.
It's a necessity to find out if he's having an affair.
What are you doing here?
Hurry up.
I'm going.
You're not gonna tell Jang-mi, right?
We'll see.
- I'm doing it just in case. - Did I say anything?
Who is it?
We're here to spread the message from God.
I already go to church.
Say it nicer.
God loves you a lot.
Which church are you from?
Please have some.
It's tiny, right? We're only staying for a while.
No, it's fine.
- Good to see you. - I know.
Na-mi, you look so young.
And Jin-hee...
I barely recognized you.
Why are you babysitting your nephew?
My sister-in-law is pregnant. So for a while...
Geum-ok!
Excuse me.
Aren't you ashamed? Your husband and sister-in-law
are doing all the hard work while you hang out with your friends.
WANTED: EDUCATORS & PROFESSIONALS
Sorry.
- Have some coffee. - Right.
Why did you close the door?!
Did I say anything wrong?
My god, she's locking me up!
Baby's crying. Go get him.
Hey guys.
Can you please leave?
That's not her. Not the denist's daughter we knew.
All is fucking vanity in life, isn't it?
Now you sound like my friend.
It's all coming back to me after meeting you girls.
Hey,
wait!
I can't find time to visit her.
Can you give this to her for me?
Please?
Can't you stop by briefly?
Perhaps if I didn't stay home...
I'll give her a call, OK?
And, I'll see guys again. Take care.
CHUN-HWA, SORRY I COULDN'T GO SEE YOU. GEUM-OK.
TO MY LOVING WIFE
I'm not eating.
- What happened? - Nothing.
- Your face is bruised! - It's nothing.
It's not nothing! What happened?
I fell down!
Yae-bin, what's wrong? What happened?
YOUNG STAR MUSIC ROOM
Come on, yeah!
Middle school kids are not allowed here.
I'm not in middle school.
What do you want?
Coffee please. Black.
You pay first.
1000 won.
Backdoor's that way if the cops come.
We saw before, right? You're Jang-mi's friend.
Do you like music? Do you come here often?
Do you have high pressure?
- Diabetes... - Huh? What?
Diabetes!
Where are you going?
Restroom.
To wash my hands.
Fuck, fuck, shit, shit!
Hey!
Hey.
Long time no see, spirit master.
Who are you?
Didn't Chun-hwa tell you this is our area?
- You fuckin'... - You little fuck!
I know everything now! You little liar.
I fucking thought it was real, bitch!
Damn bitch.
Heard you guys have a name now.
Sunny?
You sent a letter to a radio?
We're gonna change our name to English, too.
FINKLE.
Lend us some money so we can go perm our hair.
- I don't have any. - Right!
Damn liar.
Search her.
Stop it! Stop!
Hold her!
Hold her legs!
Stop staring!
Stop staring like that!
I guess you don't realize the situation.
- No one will come to... - Hey!
...rescue you.
This is too predictable, don't you think?
Come back when I'm the one in trouble.
Shinchang Girl's Vocational High?
Yeah. So what?
You know SONG Jeong-ok?
The one with a 20cm scar on her face?
I did that.
She still can't drink without spilling through her face.
Bullshit.
Give me that.
I'll make yours pretty.
It's time to watch Young Eleven.
Wait for us!
Are you ok?
Why are kids so scary these days?
Let's go that way.
If I go to the army, I want to join the military band.
Are you going to the army?
Nah, I don't have to. I'm the only son for three generations.
Oh, right.
My name's HAN Jun-ho.
I forgot to introduce my...
There's a gum on your hair.
I think it got on when you were being bullied.
You'll need acetone to remove it.
Diabetes again?
I'm here.
There's my house.
Good night then.
Oh and...
if you meet them again, tell them I'm your boyfriend.
No, you don't understand.
That bitch tempted my son to...
If you see your son, call us.
Making a propaganda leaflet is a serious felony.
Your son could go to jail.
Oh Shit! What's this?!
You motherfucker. Come in and eat dinner.
I think it's too late for that.
Mother, please go in!
Do something!
- If you take it you go to jail. - Give it back!
- Take it then! - Mom!
Take it!
If you see your son call us immediately, okay?
- I'm so sorry. - Let's go.
It's not a joke.
- Sorry, I'm so sorry. - Shit, that was scary.
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
Why did he meet this crazy girl and started labor movement?
He's gonna shame us all!
STEP DOWN! MURDEROUS DICTATOR!
Step down, military government!
It's good that school's not on. When is Su-ji coming?
- She's gonna become a star. - Pretty girls...
Where are those hobags?
It's really ok.
If they bully one of us, we pay back together.
Hello everyone. I'm Miss Ryu, the mascot of peace.
- Stop it, silly! - Body size 34...
Shit, Shit, Shit...
- Shield up! - Shield up!
Step down, dictator! We want freedom!
Step down, military government!
Hey hobags! What a great day to...
- Shitface! - Shitface! Jinx!
Jinx my ass you goddamn uncreative numskull!
Bloody barnacle biter!
Screw your mouth from hell you pissy little nincompoop twat!
Come and suck my socks, skanky snatchin' windbag!
You bloody druggie hoe!
Nitwit ninny noodle!
- Right back atcha! - Right back and forth atcha!
- Come here you bitch! - No touching my hair!
No touching!
Come here!
Have you seen anything like this?
What ya lookin' at?
At you, dummy.
Let's go to the police. I've explained everything
that my good son was tempted by the wrong croud.
Stop it, mom! Nobody tempted me into anything.
I'm coming with you, son.
- Don't be ridiculous! - Jong-gi!
Jong-gi?
Take care of grandma while I'm gone.
And, be good. OK?
Where are you going?
I decided to devote my life to democracy and workers' right.
You must never be tinged with bourgeois ideas.
Take mom inside.
The defendant was found guilty of deliberate failure to pay his employees,
Hasan and 8 other plaintiffs, for a prolonged period of time.
The court hereby orders the defendant
to immediately pay the entire amount of wage arrears
up to the termination of employment.
Next, case...
number two thousand...
Thank you.
Jong-gi,
What about mom?
She's at home. I gave her a call.
You okay?
Not the way to live your life, is it?
I'm sorry, Hasan.
Go to hell.
Geum-ok gave me a thousand bucks.
She did what she could for a friend.
You'll draw different clothes, right?
Don't move. I haven't done this for a long time.
Na-mi.
Yep?
Is there something you want to do in life?
I'm too old to have dreams.
Don't live without dreams.
Life is too short to live without them.
Told you not to move.
Chun-hwa...
Na-mi...
This fucking bastard is having an affair.
- Who? - Fuck!
What are you going to do?
I'm sorry, Chun-hwa.
I really didn't want to say stuff like this on our reunion.
Don't worry. We're all friends.
You go have an affair too!
Who wants to join?
Na-mi? Jang-mi?
I kinda want it.
But if you do it, will you still get alimony?
Shit, that's right.
How am I going to pay back this whistle dick?
Should we go and pay back together?
If they bully one of us, we pay back together, right?
That's right, Na-mi!
How do you want it done?
Like this?
Or like this?!
I'm not scared of anything. Tell me and I'll do it.
It won't hurt like that.
You have to twist it like this. Like this!
Stop mutilating my hubby's dick!
Korean girls always protect their husbands at the last moment.
You bitches, my bitches!
Your call wasn't connected...
Why aren't you picking up the phone?
I'll park at the back. Call me.
Why do you not have it?
- Are you nuts? - Fuck off!
- Bring me money, ok? - Hey!
Yae-bin, are you ok?
Why did you do this? Come here!
- The fuck... - Why are you doing this?
Who are they?
What do you care?
What's this? Who are they?
If I tell you who they are, what can you do?
Kill them?
Just go away.
Yae-bin!
Hey, insurance lady.
What's a noble personage like you doing here?
It's a good day to shed blood.
You're dressed inappropriately
Shut up! We'll do it the old way.
How?
I'll forstall them with my words.
That's my girl!
By the way, those aren't real, are they?
Shut your pie hole!
Anyway, where are the others?
What the fuck?
Thought they might recognize me.
Saucy! Your husband is a lucky guy.
Hello, my bitches!
God, you're killing me!
Look at you!
You're a goddamn schoolgirl.
Kinda cute, though. You can still pull it off.
She said she was bored. Besides, we can't leave out the leader.
Sure.
She got her boobs done.
- No kidding! - So what?
- Let me see. - Guys, it's them!
- That's them? - Stay in the back, Chun-hwa.
Lose the prejudice that cancer patients can't fight.
It's show time.
It's a non-smoking area, bitches!
- You fucking motherfucker! - Fuck!
- You skanky shiznit twat! - STFU!
What the hell is this bitch saying?
I just came to wash the car and got called.
I don't think they're crazy, but one's wearing a uniform.
Maybe it's a costume play.
Anyways, I'll be there soon.
Designer bags are awesome.
Cracks open the brain at once.
Is it funny?
Officer, this doesn't get covered by insurance, right?
How can you expect that? This is an act of violence.
Some insurance can cover injuries...
Do you have insurance?
How can you do your business in this situation?
If I perform poorly again, I'm out this month.
You should buy some. You're rich.
Did you see her fly today?
She's got some iron fists!
Revenge and justice.
Anyone else need our help?
We should start a business in this.
Let's make uniforms!
This school uniform's actually quite comfy.
Let's make flyers, too!
Minimum fee, maximum satisfaction
- "Sunny is back!" - Sunny!
Be quiet!
- Officer. - What?
Can you turn up the volume?
Yeah? Right.
Attack!
Na-mi sucks at dancing. Will she survive at the festival?
Dang! I really suck my ass!
Then get the fuck out.
We're better off without a clown.
Hey!
That was bit mean.
Chun-hwa, do you love her?
- Are you a lesbian? - What?
How do you do it with a woman?
Sunny or shitty, I don't care any more.
I'm out of here.
What do you want?
I don't understand why you hate me.
But I can't let you leave us like that.
- Us? - Yes, us!
You've grown ballsy. When were we ever "us?"
I want to know why you hate me.
There's no reason. I just hate your everything.
Get lost.
You're not going anywhere!
Get off.
Are you Su-ji's friend?
Good evening.
Nice meetin' ya. Have ya eaten yet?
Fuck off.
She never brings a friend. Come eat somethin' with us.
I ate somethin' already.
You from Jeolla-do too?
I said fuck off.
Bring her in, Mommy'll make something...
Who says you're my mom? You're a stepmom!
Good night!
It's not fair to hate me because
your stelomom's from Jeolla-do.
That's against...
democracy and it encourages regional...
You can't even drink alcohol?
It's hard for me too. My brother's a democratic activist.
He might go to jail.
And my granny calls me "sis".
What I'm sayin' is that "us" is important.
You know why "us" is important?
Still... I don't like you.
But I still like you.
Why?
Cuz you're pretty.
Honestly, I was so shocked when I saw you.
I was actually the prettiest in my old school.
But in Seoul all the girls are pretty.
But you're the prettiest.
I like you. You're the prettiest girl in the world!
I'm sorry that I'm so pretty. It's all my fault.
What are you saying? I'm the one who's sorry.
I'll stop being so pretty. You can be pretty now.
I'm pretty, too. I'm sorry.
I'll become a Seoul girl for you.
Wait, let me drink more.
One more soju please!
Did Bok-hee become a Miss Korea?
Let's go soon.
Yeah, I miss her.
No, I'm seeing Chun-hwa. I've something to give her.
Should I ask if she wants to come tomorrow?
Ok.
Help me...
Her mom took out loans to save her salon.
But she couldn't pay back, so she started working at bars...
...and ended up here.
- What about her daughter? - She's in a facility.
Poor Bok-hee...
Let's just go.
I can't see this any more.
Friends are for hard times.
Bok-hee.
Sorry. I like coffee too much.
Let's go see Chun-hwa. Shall we leave right now?
I can leave early. I left school early, too.
If you don't bring a guy, you don't get a free time.
If you have nothing else to do, go clean the toilet!
Sorry. She's usually nice.
I'll be back soon. Drink your coffee.
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
- I'm sorry. - Shut up!
Hey!
Give me the most expensive bottle here.
Pardon me?
The most expensive and overpriced one.
Also bring the most expensive food here.
And I'll pay for her fee. You serve today.
Is one million won enough? I'll pay more if you want.
Here.
Sit here.
You're my hero, Na-mi!
Bring real liquor, not the fake one!
Alright.
Bok-hee, let's find you another job.
Why? I don't need to. Do you want beef jerky?
I'll help you find other job.
But I don't have any skills.
I can do some hairdreesing. Remember my mom's hair salon?
I gave you all the double eyelid tapes, right?
Yes, let's do something like that.
You have a daughter. You have to live with her.
I want to live with Bo-mi.
Without me, she can't even...
...turn on the heater... - Bok-hee.
We'll help you.
How can you help me?
And why is Chun-hwa dying?
Isn't she supposed to take care of us all? Huh?
Na-mi.
Why are you... just looking?
You weren't sleeping?
Come here.
- Chun-hwa. - What?
Thank you.
For What?
For a long time, I lived as a wife and a mother of someone...
and forgot how I was my own being.
Now I realize that I'm the protagonist of my life.
You have a face of a protagonist.
Su-ji also had a face of a protagonist...
I'll find her for you.
What's this?
SUNNY
HUSBAND
Na-mi! Hold it straight.
Chun-hwa
you've done a great job in a man 's world.
I can't believe you're still taking care of these guys!
I think you're the best.
Jang-mi, I think you'll be the best plastic surgery patient.
You'll turn so beautiful after the double eyelid surgery.
Jin - hee! I know you'll make a swearword dictionary and
with a man you fall in love... Fuck!
You're gonna do what with a man...?
I wanna do it foo!
Hello Geum-ok! I know you'll become a very famous writer.
I also read your book and it was awesome...
Bok-hee!
Hi, Bok-hee. I believe you're a Miss Korea by now.
And you probably have a loving husband and children.
That's so awesome!
Bok-hee, you'll be loved by everyone.
I love you so much!
- Su-ji! - Our magazine model!
- Show us some pose! - Yeah, show us!
- Show us! - Show us!
It's your turn, Na-mi.
Hello, Na-mi of the future.
I'm the high school Na-mi.
I think you'd be an artist by now.
And once you're in college you'd be a DJ.
And I also want to become an owner of a comic bookstore.
I won't charge late fee. Also...
I think you really look like Sophie Marceau.
What?
I'll be in movies like La Boum.
And I also wanna become a dancer...
You can't even dance!
Chun-hwa, come here!
Where're you going?
To drink water!
Buy me a salad bun!
No money!
Hey, farm girl!
You drink water like a true farm girl.
What do you want?
I have something to ask.
I heard that in the countryside...
...people group fuck behind hay stacks.
- Have you done that? - LEE Sang-mi!
Shut the fuck up!
Wow, I'm impressed.
Don't expect Chun-hwa and her pals to stick around forever.
- They'll dump you as soon as... - Stop fucking with me!
I'm letting you go this once.
Be careful!
MEET ME AT THE GARBAGE DUMP.
Hey, farm girl!
You didn't say I have to come alone.
Say sorry.
What?
If you say sorry, I'll forgive everything.
I won't.
I'll say it first, then. I'm sorry I used swearwords.
I heard you were friends with Chun-hwa but you had a fight
because Chun-hwa didn't like you sniffing glue...
I can't listen to this bullshit any more.
You guys call yourself what? Sunny?
You guys don't realize this is the end of yours.
I'm going to kill all of you, one by one...
...starting from today.
Give me the camera.
Take them off.
What a fucking mess.
Say that again. You're gonna do what?
Fucking bitch!
Do you want your pretty face to get ruined?
I'll scratch your...
You'll have to take her to the hospital.
Don't do it, Su-ji!
Don't do it!
If I were you
I'd be too shamed to come to school.
We're going on a travel with my bro's friends.
Two days. You should join.
Jun-ho is coming too!
What happened?
Gosh, what's wrong?
Did you fight?
- I fell down. - You did not!
It's quite serious.
Who the fuck smokes in school?
And American cigarette?
Didn't I tell you I'll rip you off if I find you smoking?
Put everything in your bag and pocket on the desk.
Now!
Are you crazy?
Get up.
Get up.
Get up. Get up!
You're not getting up? Huh? Get up!
Get the fuck up!
Ok. You're a dead meat.
You're making me real angry.
I'll show you how a Marine beats bitches like you.
Go back to the army and fuck yourself, motherfucker!
We still can't find JUNG Su-ji.
This isn't the best solution, but we could publish an obituary.
But of course, we'll try again.
And the person you asked me to find separately...
HAN JUN-HO
Don't hit her without me!
Wassup?
Nothing.
Come and play with us.
Come on in!
- Coffee, please. - Sure.
Dad! You're late.
You haven't been here for a long time.
No?
It's been a while.
I can finally give this to you.
JINDEOK SCHOOL FESTIVAL
I LOVE SU-JI
SU-JI IS MY LIFE
The power of mass media!
After Su-ji got on the magazine, her fans have tripled!
What if she becomes a real movie star?
Not a big deal.
If you become a movie star, let's do the eyelid surgery together!
I was gonna do that for you!
Why are you acting weird?
Nothing.
Go get something to eat. We have enough time.
Na-mi!
I thought of you a lot.
I'm sorry.
I should have been nicer to a new kid.
Forgive me.
No, I'm sorry.
Really?
Then let's eat together to celebrate our friendship.
You smell like glue.
I smell?
Do I smell?!
No.
- You smell like glue... - For fuck's sake!
Of course I smell!
You drink "Sunny 10", so you smell like Sunny.
You want some?
You should try it. Come on.
Come on.
Go on, drink.
Go on!
Next is our proud drum and fife band,
who came back from the successful Africa tour!
Ooh, sexy
Chun-hwa.
I'm buying you this.
You gotta drink something.
That's ok.
Why? You think I'm dirty?
Drink it for our friendship!
I'm Sunny from now on. Sunny smell, Sunny...
I told you I'll kill you if you come sniffin' glue!
Get her up.
Why am I not allowed?
What's so special about her?
Hey, pretty face.
- Su-ji! - Su-ji!
Get out of here!
Su-ji...
You're all expelled.
Fantastic job in front of the inspector!
Where is the other one? Hey, you!
Come here, little piece of shit!
Come here!
Is that how you were taught in your old school?
I sold everything to move here. For your education!
Don't hit her!
One goes of jail, the other gets suspended!
Get the fuck out of my house. All of you!
Why did you hang out...
...with bad girls? - Please don't hit her, papa.
Father.
I sold out my comrades to save my skin.
I'm a goddamn dog.
I'll live like a dog from now.
Oh, my baby. My son!
My boy!
How is she?
She tried to kill herself.
It's ok. She's not dead.
It's ok.
We're not going to see each other again?
IM Na-mi!
Getting expelled from school isn't the end of Sunny.
We'll meet again, bring Su-ji with us
and dance what we couldn't dance today.
Understand?
Do you understand?
We'll meet again.
If you ignore us because your life is too good,
we'll go and punish you.
If you hide because your life sucks,
we'll go and make it better.
I don't know who will die first among us,
but until that day...
No, even beyond that day... We, Sunny, will never break up.
- Why did you come? - I missed you.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's ok.
Downtown is usually the best route...
- Mr. Bong? - Yes?
Downtown is never the best route.
Ok...
What?
What?
Mom!
Your phone.
Jang-mi?
This is the problem of dying single. No family.
Is that why you won't get a divorce?
He gave me a building.
Also he said he won't again.
Did you have an affair too?
You did?
You did!
You said we should do it together!
Who said I did?
And you said you'd think about it, you indecisive bitch.
Stop swearing in the funeral.
Crazy bitches.
Na-mi.
Geum-ok?
How did you make it?
I don't care any more.
You go girl!
Geum-ok the dentist's girl!
Long time no see!
- How have you been? - Good.
You haven't changed a bit.
- Really? - Yeah.
It's so nice to see you!
Wait a sec, I want to say hi to Chun-hwa.
You can wait. We'll do it together when everybody comes.
Who else is coming? Su-ji? Is she ok?
What about Bok-hee? Did she become a Miss Korea?
The prize money was too small.
It's good to see you guys!
How come nobody's here?
The actual funeral was yesterday.
Today she just wanted us.
Chun-hwa's always special. Let's wait for Su-ji together.
Su-ji is coming? Is her face ok?
We didn't actually find her, but we did put an ad.
SU-JI, PLEASE ATTEND CHUN-HWA'S LAST CONCERT!
Let's sit down and talk.
Let's wait till 12. Everybody ok with that?
Geum-ok?
I'm fine. Not going back there tonight.
Bok-hee, what do you do?
This and that... I'm looking for a new job.
You're so lucky. Every women should have a job.
I'm tired of being ignored by my husband and his family.
I don't think it's a bad thing to have a husband.
- What? Do they bully you? - Uh-huh.
- Should we punish them? - Yeah!
Didn't I tell you about when we beat up Na-mi's daughter's bully?
- No, never! - Tell me, tell me!
It's a bit complicated...
I guess Su-ji can't make it.
- Should we greet now? - Alright.
Did you come for HA Chun-hwa's funeral?
I'm the lawyer of Mrs. HA.
Are you the members of "Sunny?"
I'm here to execute the will of Mrs. HA.
She especially ordered me to read it realistically.
So please bear with me.
Hey bitches!
I just read it like...
Sorry, I'll read it again.
Hey b... b... I'll skip that.
Is everyone here?
If you didn't make it, I understand.
I'm sorry we didn't keep the promise we made
in front of Su-ji's house 25 years ago.
I know I'm a bad leader for dying so early.
Na-mi, thanks for finding our friends.
My life wasn't long, but...
as you've said, I was the protagonist of my life.
Thank you for that.
Na-mi will be the next leader of Sunny.
Please enjoy the life together for me,
all of you.
Take care.
Congrats, Na-mi.
Thanks.
Mrs. HA left presents for all of you.
KIM Jang-mi.
Yes?
Are you an insurance agent?
Yes.
Everyone here is going to buy every insurance you sell.
All the fees will be paid in full.
I'm so happy for you!
How...?
She left a large sum of money behind.
She donated the rest to charity and...
You're the insurance queen of the month, bitch!
I've never been a queen before!
HWANG Jin-hee.
Yes?
You can be the vice-leader.
That's it.
But I was always the vice-leader.
Don't lie. The vice-leader was me.
What are you talking about?
Su-ji and I were always the vice-leader.
Are you disappointed?
Not exactly...
She told me to read here if you're disappointed.
I'm not.
What does it say?
Bitch! You're rich!
You are rich!
- You even have a building! - Okay, okay.
- SEO Geum-ok. - Yes?
You majored in Korean Literature?
Yes I did.
There's a small publishing company under Mrs. HA.
You'll start there as an intern,
hired after six months,
and if you maintain the 150% sales rate for two years,
you'll be hired as the executive manager.
Really?
- Good for you! - Congrats!
She also left these words.
I'll kill you if you screw up.
That's so Chun-hwa!
RYU Bok-hee.
Yes.
She left you an apartment to live with your daughter.
All the living expenses, tuition, and marriage expenses
will be provided by the company fund.
She also booked a hospital for your rehab.
When you get better, you'll go through a vocational training
and open up your own business on the 1st floor
of Geum-ok's company.
Thank you!
- Thank you! - Bok-hee...
There's one thing you need to do.
Did all of you receive registered mail?
The dance video.
This is Chun-hwa's last wish. Let's make it awesome.
Did you practice?
I tried few times for diet.
Are we allowed to do this in a funeral?
The leader wants it.
If someone complains, I'll take the responsibility.
You the leader!
The vice-leader's got your back!
Ok. Let's do this!
