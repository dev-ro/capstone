My bike ignites!
Farewell, useless Father
Farewell, Grandmother
Farewell, Buddha of Ushiku
Farewell...
"Baby,
the Stars Shine Bright"
And farewell, Ichigo
It's too late to say this, but...
I wish I had been born
in the Rococo era
Kamikaze Girls: The End
That's a bit too short
so let's rewind a little
Rococo
18th century France
at it's most lavish
It made Baroque look positively sober
An obscure, neglected period
Rarely mentioned in class
Critics called its art "cloying"...
Shallow, vulgar and indecent
Life then was like candy
Their world, so sweet and dreamy
That was Rococo
Girdles were tightened for
beauty's sake
Too tight for breathing
It was...
Very cute!
Or so they said
Ridiculous!
Hedonism and lovemaking were all
that mattered
Out of bed, they liked embroidery
Then it was back to the bedroom
And then? Countryside walks
I was smitten by Rococo
A frilly dress
and strolls in the country
That's how I wanted to live!
It's not happening
Not in 21st century lbaraki
This is Shimotsuma
Paddy-fields, not countryside
I live here
Shit on my shoes
30 minutes on foot
to Shimotsuma station
It's faster by bike but not as elegant
In this outfit
Isn't that Ryugasaki's daughter?
Where are you going in
that frilly dress?
Tokyo
What for?
Clothes shopping
But Jusco sells everything
Jusco?
The supermarket?
Don't you know anything?
Shimotsuma's branch has much more
They have anything you want
Much more than Parco
This polo shirt was 980 yen
This was only 1,500 yen
This blouse was 2,800 yen
This is from Jusco
This, too
The people here are...
completely twisted
Is it due to a lack of
parental communication?
To go to Tokyo...
you take the Joso line to Toride
Only 2 trains an hour
...communication is vital
While we wait, here's my profile
Let's take a look!
"The Life of Momoko Ryugasaki"
I wasn't born here
or in France...
but in far-away Amagasaki
Get out of my face!
The locals were mostly gangsters
Nothing but pachinko parlors
and counterfeiters
Each stall undercutting the next
Get it cheap!
Everyone obsessed with bargains
Everyone is born in a tracksuit
They die in a tracksuit, too
It was tracksuit country
and for me it was hometown
Gangsters here graduate from Yanki
to Yakuza
As Father did in his youth
Let's go!
I can't do it!
And so, my parents met
This ludicrous encounter led to
my birth
A shotgun wedding
Dad put family first
Cough up the money!
That's for baby milk
Asshole!
Thought we were stupid?
I need my pinkie...
to play piano
He's expelled
He was a useless father
It's 1 hour to Toride
Then 40 minutes to Ueno
on the Joban line
Tokyo's a long way off
Mother left home after I began school
Then the divorce papers came
Who does she think she is?
But even in this crisis...
So what?
...was my take
Silently they die
I was an indifferent child
He's hopeless
He's totally mediocre. A born loser
But your new dad is nice
Doesn't drink or gamble
I wonder...
why he finds me so attractive?
It's still a mystery...
He was the gynaecologist...
who delivered me
Doctor!
Madam!
Doctor
Madam
It didn't take her long
to choose adultery
I'm moving in with my father
Why?
Your new grandparents are dying
to see you
They're dying to hug
their new granddaughter!
That's not true, is it?
Well, no
I was 6 when I moved to
my father's place
Can you see it coming?
Because it was more fun
Should I go through with this divorce?
Isolate myself from you?
Humans are cowards in
the face of happiness
You need courage to hold on
to happiness
How old are you?
33
It's your last chance
to grasp happiness. Don't miss it
Momoko!
Take his love
and make yourself beautiful
Get breast implant
and beauty treatments
And enter a beauty contest
Why?
It's fun
Dad wasn't the same
after the separation
But he got help...
and soon had his own market stall
Look at this!
Ve**ach tops only 2,000 yen
This Ve**ach bag only 1,500 yen!
That's also a French import
He didn't even know
Ver**ce was Italian
But business boomed
Bargain-hunters' paradise!
In junior high I joined a club
and got hooked on needlework
Father got even more into it...
He was creating new Ver**ce goods
by himself
And you know what?
The Yankis loved it
When I was in high school...
I discovered the "Lolita" look
The grand opening of
Uni***sal Studios Japan
What's this?
It's a collaboration
They have nothing in common!
You've got a lot to learn
I have a feel for the fashion industry
and can sense today's hot trends
It's about dual-name brands now
Bag and clothing brands
and big banks, too
Dual-name brands are everywhere
The public will love it!
Get your crap out of here!
Business was roaring
His products were hits
And that put us in danger
Uni***sal Studios may sue
Ver**ce could also lash out
Time to take a holiday
That's why we moved...
to my grandmother's place
in Shimotsuma
Ueno to Shibuya by Yamanote line
Then Toyoko line to Daikanyama
To my favourite boutique...
"Baby,
the Stars Shine Bright"
Welcome!
I discovered the label
one summer in Osaka
The "old me" was slain
And I was reborn
Such was designer
Akinori Isobe's power
I would do anything to own them
My classmate's home burnt down
Her family is broke with
ten mouths to feed
I must help my best friend
This girl has a terminal heart problem
Says she'd die by 15
But she found a specialist
who can cure her
He doesn't hold a licence
it will cost her 1 billion yen
My best friend's sister...
was abducted by foreign spies
from a Karaoke bar
Miss Ryugasaki, it's always a pleasure
So what if I was deceitful?
My happiness was at stake
It's not wrong to feel good
That's what Rococo taught me
But actually my soul is rotten
This is my grandmother
Momoko, can I have 200 yen?
What for?
Chocolate
Lovely milk chocolate
She isn't senile
She's just had a hard life
Now I look after her
Pugnacity runs in the family
She loved fighting
when she was younger
and ultimately lost an eye
Don't you bastards explode on me!
My useless father had a new stall
But money was now more scarce
I had to find a new source of income
Discount Ve**ach clothes for sale
Brand new
but not really Ver**ce
Ms. Ryugasaki,
can I have some Ver**ce clothes
as I totally love Ver**ce
totally please?
The note was crude
and stained with juice
How old could she be?
Her name: Ichiko Shirayuri
I invited her over as
her home wasn't far
Can I have 100 yen?
To buy what?
My favourite apple candy
I almost forgot...
Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone!
A Yanki!
Drawn-on eyebrows!
She spat!
Little girl, I'm Ichiko Shirayuri
Momoko 'T is thee I'm seeking
What language is this?
Yes?
Can thee bring fair Momoko forth?
Did she step out of a period-drama?
Little girl, Where's Momoko?
I am Momoko
Don't mess with me!
A junior high girl selling Ver**ce?
Bring me Momoko
She spat again!
Wow, is this all Ver**ce?
Yes, but it's fake
So it's really you?
Yes, I'm Momoko Ryugasaki
I'm in 2nd year of senior high
Damn! Same year as me
I figured only a child
would wear frilly dress
I shouldn't judge by appearances
But appearance says everything
Did I say something wrong?
Cool!
What's this?
Uni***sal and Ver**ce?
This is so cool!
I need a jacket.
There's a wedding to go to
I thought my kamikaze coat was OK
but my parents said no
So I thought a Ver**ce jacket
would be fine
But it was out of my price range
But then I found your ad
It was like salivation
Did she mean "salvation"?
How much?
How much?
3? Get outta here!
Really? You'll give it to me for 2?
Wrong number of zeros
200,000 yen?
2,000 yen
Nobody sells a Ver**ce jacket
for 2,000 yen?
It is a fake, after all
Fake or not, it's still Ver**ce
20,000 will be fine
It's still too cheap
But you did say 2,000 was OK
Thanks for the discount. I owe you
If there's any trouble...
ask for Ichiko of the Ponytails
The Ponytails?
The toughest girl-biker gang
in Shimotsuma
Don't forget it
I've got a puny grip
I can't run fast or swim
But for Rococo fragility...
is considered a feminine virtue
Tough girls who defend themselves...
disgust me
Girls who have experienced both sour
and sweet
Awful!
Sour things taste foul
I want to fill myself only
with sweet things
Your nose is beautiful
Get off me!
Beautiful!
It's a 3-tier seat
120 cm, custom-built
It should have cost a pile
but I did it myself cheaply
Do you like bikes?
Not really
I work part-time at a garage
So you like bikes?
It's not about "liking".
My bike is another me
But you ride a scooter...
That doesn't matter!
You wanted a bigger bike
but didn't qualify?
None of your business!
Does this still run?
It's my grandmother's. Why?
Honda made it in the '80s
I thought they were all gone
It's a beauty
The other guy doesn't agree,
and you feel like
Why don't you get it?
From then on,
that Yanki would come over
I want to be a bike mechanic
I asked my boss if he'd train me
He said only
if I graduated high school
I was moved!
She could talk endlessly
What are you going to do
after graduation?
Labour isn't suitable for me
Don't daydream!
It's dog-eat-dog out there!
Always hot under the collar...
I wondered
why she'd talk about such thing
I don't understand how humans connect
why can't you get it?
Humans are born alone...
we think alone and die alone
If I can't live independently...
then I'd rather be a water flea
They are more independent than us
What about friends or lovers?
Wouldn't you miss your parents
or kids?
Meaningless words,
just like janitor or president
None of those words is important
You poor girl! That's terrible!
I'd never let anyone tie me down
So I fled into the dark night
Though I was just 15, I felt so free
So on my stolen bike...
How many are there
in the Ponytails gang?
Seven
Tiny!
Do you want to join us?
No thanks
You'll need a licence first
And get rid of the dresses
We like riding and fighting
but no drugs
We're too proud for that
I'm not joining
No loose girls, either
I said "no"
Why are you so hesitant?
I'm not hesitating
I don't want to ride a bike
or be in a group
I'm not shedding this dress
What's wrong?
It's just lame
Did you just ridicule
my whole existence?
I'll kick your ass!
Go ahead
I'll kill you!
Why not?
Stop spitting!
You may be in a frilly dress
but you have guts
You're not gonna kill me?
No, because I still owe you
Debts, debts, debts... What a fool!
What did you say?
Only lend stuff you don't care about
I'd never return borrowed stuff
and I don't care if I lose mine
You're a bad girl
Yes, twisted!
No friends?
Isn't it lonely?
Not at all
You're weird
But if you beg...
I'll let you be my friend
I don't need any friends
I thought I'd always be alone
80 years old, in a "Baby" dress
dying alone in my apartment
A robot-janitor finds my corpse...
The End
That's the end that I dreamt of
What's aristocratic about this forest?
Forest of the Aristocrats
What are you listening to?
Johann Strauss
Don't know that band
Stop that
Where did you get that frilly dress?
Daikanyama, in Tokyo
Where did you buy your clothes?
Jusco
Another victim...
So you know Daikanyama?
You know the embroiderer called Emma?
My kamikaze coat needs decoration
What kind of stitching?
Our leader Akimi's quitting
to get married
I want something special
for her parade
Parade?
We ride around in style on
her final night
A partening gift to our leader
It's parting, not "partening"
Smart ass!
Want to part with your life?
Then she got really serious
as she described her first encounter
with Akimi
It took an hour
To save time, I'll summarize
Ichiko aged 14
Her life changed in high school
As a young girl
her life was not that of a Yanki
She was fairly slow
and the shyest in her class
She was bullied by her classmates
Filled with self-hate and frustration
So on my stolen bike...
I don't have a clue where I am headed
That's when she met Akimi
What's wrong?
What are you hiding?
Everyone's got a problem.
There's always pain
It's OK to cry...
but women can't do it in public
Otherwise everyone will break down
So only cry alone
It makes you stronger
That moment Ichiko decided...
to be as cool as Akimi
Great story, huh?
What about
that embroiderer in Daikanyama?
Oh, yeah
Akimi looked after me, so...
I want a message sewn onto my outfit
Saying?
"Thank you Akimi"
That's a bit dull
What's your problem?
Emma's a legend among biker gangs
Needlework so delicate and beautiful!
So daring and profound!
Seen any with your own eyes?
Of course not!
Where in Daikanyama is it?
Nobody knows
Then you can't place an order
Himiko knows!
Himiko?
The former leader of
the girl-bikers in Kanagawa
She wore gear stitched by Emma
So contact Himiko
But Himiko is...
It took her another hour
to tell Himiko's story
Another long saga...
Here's a cartoon version
to keep you kids awake
In the 90's, the bikers
were at war with street gangs
Torn apart by feuds and crime
Stop it, you idiots!
Age and origin unknown,
she was a seven-time convict
Everyone called her...
Himiko
Her back emblazoned with...
Emma's golden dragon,
Himiko took all Kanagawa's girl-bikers
by storm
Crushing gangs dealing in drugs
and prostitution
Clean up this scum!
Girls unite!
Lead us Himiko!
We want to be in your gang
I don't believe in hierarchy.
We'll ride together!
I'm coming!
Me, too
Let's go!
I'll *#*# you with my *=*!
The Yakuza forced us into drugs
and prostitution
Help us, please!
Next day, Himiko paid a visit
to the local Yakuza HQ
She sliced them and diced them
Left 20 wounded
And then, silence
Nobody has heard from her since
So she's untraceable?
I'm going home
Ever since I was small
I've dreamt of flying up into the sky
The town below me shrinks as
I soar higher...
on my way to another world
There's a vulgar Yanki...
Oh, it's Ichiko
She's screaming something at me
Leave me alone, Ichiko
I'm off to a beautiful world...
you've never seen
Are you listening?
What?
Money's an issue,
I'm dealing with a legend
It would cost 50,000 or more
Still talking about that?
My pay is not good
and neither is my family's
Is your family poor?
I don't want to owe them
Well, you could sell your body...
That's it!
Are you serious?
Pachinko! I have to give it a go
Let's go
Momoko?
Pachinko is our only choice!
Why should I?
We're friends
I'll take this, please
Thank you, Miss Ryugasaki
This is your new friend
This cabbage will be your friend
Well...
Farewell, Ichiko! Farewell,
legendary idiot!
Relief was short-lived
Kidnapped by a Yanki
who wouldn't take "no"
Dragged down the path to hell
Ozaki's song!
I feel lucky
Hopeless
No good at all
Momoko?
What's happening?
You're amazing!
They're cheating, I know it!
Welcome...
I don't know your technique
but you're using it a bit too much
What's your problem, asshole?
I saw you mess with the machine
Now I'll have to search you
What did you say, baldy?
Let me see
Stop it!
Stand back
Those girls did nothing wrong
I was watching
It's Ryuji!
It's...
Unicorn Ryuji
Even if they were cheating
it's up to you to catch them
it's still your fault
Those are the rules of this game
But they' re underage
I'm 18!
But she can't be
She dresses like a kid but she's 30
Quite mature
Actually, she's 40
You let them play for hours
She's my mother!
Shut it
I'll crush 'em
Will you count
their winnings right now?
Old man... thank you!
He looked like Ozaki
In what way?
70,000? Not bad for an amateur!
Let's halve this
Why?
Well...
I'm not taking your money
Why?
My policy
Then here's a loan
Here's 35,000 yen
You're weird
You'll get it back
Your policy?
Ichiko
Your real name is Ichigo, right?
I phoned you, your mum answered
She called you "Ichigo"
I'm sure it was Ichigo
Why do you hide it?
It's just so un-Yanki!
Ichigo!
Don't use that name
I'll kill you
Ichigo!
You're dead!
Mice probably ate it
Grandma
Are you going somewhere?
Nope
Maybe it's punishment...
for playing Pachinko with a Yanki
The Rococo gods are angry
Amazing work!
Grandmother
You're not like your father
If everyone had a bowl
Your father's would be small...
cracked and dirty
But yours is different
It isn't big but it's beautiful
You'll follow your own path
You'll find your own niche
The Pachinko God is showing mercy
No, it isn't
We've got to do it
Let me go
We can't go back
To where?
Big Winner!
Hey!
At it again?
You're not aiming correctly
Aim for that one, not that one
Don't touch me
The best spot...
is here
You did great!
Who are you, old man?
Why do you have patent-leather shoes?
I'm just a low-rank gangster
Yakuza
That explains the shoes
That's Ozaki's song
This joke of a man
had taken someone's heart
Humans are a mystery...
Are you scared of guys?
Are you crazy?
Been out on a date?
Shut up!
Ever kissed?
You wanna die?
A girl like you in love...
A guy with a blue jacket
and white leather shoes
When you spoke to him,
you looked so beautiful
Isn't that what they call love?
It's love!
It's love
It's love
Is it love?
It's love
We musn't!
Madam...
It's love!
I returned to Daikanyama
after a long absence
with Ichigo, determined to find Emma
They can't patronise me
What does that writing say?
This says "leave me alone"
I thought so
That's the wrong character
The whole gang has it! People will laugh at us!
It was perfect before you told me
Is that bonnet from here?
It was eaten by moths...
so I repaired it
No, I love it.
You fixed it wonderfully!
Look at her bonnet,
she fixed it herself
You're making her uneasy, boss
Sorry
And you are?
The boss?
Miss Ryugasaki, our loyal customer
You're Miss Ryugasaki?
The boss?
You are...
You're the "Baby" designer...
I'm Isobe
Momoko!
What did you do to her?
Me?
Don't act dumb!
You speak, she falls.
Got a breath problem?
Ichigo, stop
It was my fault
No fighting
Momoko!
I am so sorry
It really was nothing
Hold still...
Wonderful!
God!
Are you OK?
I met God
That old man?
God touched me
He's your God?
We must find Emma
You said "no"
Humour me.
I need to do something crazy
Let's go
You saying I'm crazy?!
Fashion was my teacher
It taught me how to live
When I see clothes...
I want to become worthy of them
They answer me
You're not ready for us yet
Or you may think...
something suits you
when it really doesn't
You don't understand, do you?
You weren't listening
Listen!
What is it?
I saw him
The legendary embroiderer?
Haruo Mizuno
The famous critic
Don't you know him?
So what took so long?
I was watching him
What was he doing?
Buying his dinner
Welcome!
He asked them to heat it
Yes, please
That's it?
You're pathetic!
Who insisted on finding
this embroiderer?
I just can't find it
Does it even exist?
Himiko said it does
Does Himiko even exist?
Legendary Emma? Legendary Himiko?
Nothing but rumours!
Don't make me laugh
I didn't ask you to look
Here's your money
Maybe you're right
Maybe the embroiderer doesn't exist
I give up
So I won't need this
And Akimi's parade?
Forget it
Got it!
Can't I do your stitching?
If it's OK with you, I'd like to try
Go for it
Really?
What about the size and font?
It's all in your hands
I trust you to do it right
Are you sure?
"Thank you Akimi" may be dull
It may not be cool
but it's how I truly feel
I stitched non-stop
From Monday night
through Wednesday morning
I forgot to eat,
sleep or go to school
Make it bigger
That's not enough water
Did you really do this?
I've never seen anything so cool!
It's absolutely gorgeous
It's unbelievable
How can I thank you?
I'm even deeper in debt to you
I didn't understand
I felt like crying
when I saw her delight
I, who coldly watched wild animals die
Was it lack of sleep?
Momoko!
Are you OK?
Is she dead?
Number 19: Hitomi Asano
Number 20: Midori Saionji
Great figure!
Unbelievable for a 40-year old
I slept like a corpse
I never imagined...
that my mother would enter
a beauty contest
Here are the results
The Grand Prix goes to...
Number Twenty...
...One: Tomomi Kuroda
Yes!
Serves you right!
What an ass!
Momoko! Wake up!
There is a god!
He watches and punishes those
who do bad things
Momoko, never give up
What?
Live sincerely,
then great things can happen
She failed! I'm so happy!
Miss Ryugasaki,
I require your assistance
Isobe, "Baby, the Stars Shine Bright"
God!
The samples came back
without the roses
I gave precise instructions
but they can't redo it in time
Cute!
Yes it is
But...
it's just frills, cheap frills
Without roses it's worthless
I recalled that bonnet you altered
Can you stitch the roses
onto this sample?
No! I can't do it!
You can't refuse!
No...
It has to be you
Ribbon stitch?
I can use ribbons for the roses
Much better than lace
Feather-stitches for leaves
and flower patches for texture
For a more rustic look...
Only you can do this!
You will do it, won't you?
Does it have to be me?
It has to be you!
It has to be you!
It has to be you!
It has to be me
Hello
Ichigo?
How was the parade?
Was Akimi pleased?
She told me...
"that sobbing girl
I knew has grown up"
She hugged me
It moved me
We then rode behind her
We rode forever
Then we lit fireworks
Akimi said, "thank you"
Then that guy appeared
That was a good parade
From now, I'm riding with him
and with one other...
I'm pregnant
Great!
That's cool!
I'm nothing compared to Akimi
I can't betray her
Why not?
If you like something, take it
If it makes you happy, do it!
Humans always betray each other
Really?
Not really
Thus Ichigo's first love ended
She showed no emotion
She kept it tightly inside
That was her way
Hey Momoko...
"women shouldn't cry in public"
But...
out here we're alone
Got it!
My hands are shaking
And my palms are sweaty
When mother left me, I said to her...
Humans are cowards
in the face of happiness
You need courage to hold on
to happiness
How old are you?
17
That's appalling
Sudden happiness has indeed
made me a coward
I've forgotten what happiness means
Was it about wearing clothes?
Or was it about making them?
What's up? Grandma died?
Are you busy?
I've got a gang meeting
I want to see you
Say again?
I have to see you
Where are you?
Good question
I'm not sure
I'll go anywhere
I can't believe you're asking
That's great! Why worry?
Just do your best
Don't let them get you down
You don't get it
What is it then?
I only enjoy wearing their clothes
Making them's different
But I loved what you stitched for me
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Yes, it does, but...
Someone recognized your talent
What are you pouting about?
If you blow him off,
where'll his clients go?
They'll end up in Jusco
You're the one
Ichiko speaking
No it's not
I had to work
Challenge? Why?
So it's a challenge
OK, by the Buddha
2pm tomorrow
What was that about?
Nothing
I think I'll leave the gang
Why?
When it was small
the gang was cool
So what's next?
I'll ride alone
Attention!
Add water!
Check!
Take a rubber band
Thank you
Thank you
There's something I want to ask
Your great leader is needed
Stay put 'til I get back
What?
What happens
when bikers challenge you?
A challenge?
As I recall,
they mess you up pretty good
They chain you to their bikes
and drag your ass
It's very nasty!
Or they might burn you with cigarettes
Or poke pencils in your nose
and whack your head on a desk
Very bloody!
For girls, they'd slash your face
with razors
Forget about marriage!
Happy days! Ah, youth is grand!
But the deadline is today
Yes, I'm sorry
This is work, not a hobby
I have to see my friend
Is she more important than your job?
The girl who knocked me down?
Yes
Do you like embroidery?
I guess so...
Yes!
Me, too
Making clothes was everything to me
I gave my life to this business
And friendships meant nothing
I sacrificed them for my work
I believed work was more important
I'm sorry but I...
Now, I have no friends
Absolutely none
There's nobody I can really talk to
You must go
You must see her
Yes
How do I get to the Ushiku Buddha?
Take route 294 to the 125
to Kasumigaura
Cross over Tsuchiura to Amizakashitare
turn right and you're there
Grandmother!
She seems troubled
Thank you
But I don't know how to ride!
What was that for?
Just hit the starter,
then turn this to take off
Easier than a bicycle!
I'll bring it back
Goodbye everybody
I'm leaving this world...
for another one
Do I have to give birth?
Who?
Where am I?
I'm a mother
But I can't decide
Mother?
Even if I give birth...
this child...
won't be happy
You have to let me out!
If I'm not born now...
Ichigo!
It's moving!
Give birth, you adulterer!
Ichigo!
It's so full of energy
My baby...
I guess it really wants to live
Ichigo!
Miko, Ichiko's little friend is here
Miko, how'd the gang get
to be such a mess?
Why merge with the Tsuchiura crew?
Getting bigger
and pushing people around
Things have changed
Small gangs just don't cut it
Can't turn the clock back
lbaraki unite!
It's not my call
Himiko gave me the order
Himiko?
She told me and Tsuchiura's boss
to unite the women of lbaraki
So you're just Himiko's puppet?
Show some manners
Society chucked us out
Common sense and decency...
Didn't we want to escape
from all that?
So what?
Look at you!
Your boss commands...
and you obey
No different from the world
we left behind
The gang grew up. Why don't you?
If this is getting old
I think I'll stay young
Figure you can just leave?
Figure your frilly friend
is more important?
She's no friend
She stands up for herself
She follows only her own rules
Next to her,
you sheep are worth nothing
So you're through with us
You got that right
I'm going it alone
Like her
First, face your challenge
I've got your challenge
right over here
Bring it on
You got any guts without a weapon?
I'll kick your ass
Get ready to bleed
Can't take it?
Take this!
Finish her!
So, no rules?
I'm ready!
Ichigo
Shut up!
Momoko!
You bitches really got me
pissed off now!
Ideally...
I would have been born
in the Rococo era
What did Himiko say to you?
She ordered you to unite lbaraki?
Which Himiko is that?
The real Himiko
wouldn't speak to scum like you
What are you saying?
Do you know the real Himiko?
Can you prove she exists?
You think you can?
You bet I can
I'm her daughter
Listen up!
I'll tell you why she disappeared
She fell in love
With your precious
Daikanyama embroiderer
They loved each other
After they first made love...
my father embroidered
her golden dragon
They married, then disappeared
Only I know where they live
My dad taught me
I was his best apprentice
Let me show you my work
The work of a legend
Just compare it to the crap
you're wearing
Really OK to tell this rabble...
these great secrets?
Maybe not
Fools like you make me talk
Want to make an enemy of
Himiko's daughter?
Every girl in Eastern Japan
would hunt you down
If you swear never
to touch my friend...
I'll give you lbaraki
OK
My lady, if you please
For the record, we win, you lose
Nice lie!
My mouth got carried away
But why did they fall for it?
Because it wasn't all lies
Himiko couldn't order Miko
They couldn't swallow their own lies
so they easily fell for yours
Was your story a lie?
Of course!
Himiko never existed
A few years back, I invented her
I forged her diary and
sent it to a biker magazine
They actually published it
and the legend just kept growing
Wait a minute. Why did you...
feed me
that crap about Emma's embroidery?
You weren't buying my story
I got offended
That's one more I owe you
You don't have to pay me back
I wasn't going to
I mean, I can't
I can't afford it!
Here's what happened next
The next day...
Cute! Beautiful!
He loved my handiwork
And I became a part-time designer
He asked me to join the company
after graduation
But then I thought, I preferred...
buying my favourite clothes
to making them
Because
it's a more extravagant lifestyle
You see, I'm still a child
Riding around my own frilly streets
Ichigo began modelling for "Baby"...
after impressing a perverted cameraman
And so began her new career
On her first day,
she broke two cameras
and left 5 of the crew
with ugly bruises
Get your hands off me, you perverts!
She was very beautiful
Soon everyone wanted her to pose
But it just wasn't her style
She preferred her bikes
and greasy overalls...
She rides the roads of Shimotsuma...
Alone, of course
Before I forget...
Another page was added
to the Himiko legend
The legend says...
She had a daughter
who took up her mother's legacy
uniting gangs everywhere
With a companion,
she destroyed the bad gangs
Nobody knew why, but...
she always wore a frilly dress
My bike ignites!
