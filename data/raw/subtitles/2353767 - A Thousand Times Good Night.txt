Can you ask them if I can go in
the car for a few kilometers?
I wanna tell the story, can you ask them?
I wanna get out!
Let me out!
ID!
A bomb!
A bomb!
Bomb!
Get away!
Hey!
Rebecca?
Listen, listen.
- You are here.
- Yeah.
Where am I?
Dubai. They flew you to Dubai.
The kids?
The kids are home.
- Rebecca.
- The kids.
Oh.
Let me do it.
Thanks.
I'm glad you came.
Thank you.
What is it?
Tell me.
I can't.
It's nothing.
- Mommy, Mommy!
- Lisa, hey!
Good to see you.
- Doesn't it hurt?
- No, don't worry.
Hey!
It's good to see you.
Hey!
Somebody is very excited.
- Come on! 
- Oh... Wow!
Welcome home mommy!
Oh, it's beautiful.
We got so many flowers mom. People thought you died.
- Oh my god, Lisa.
- What? It was like when grandpa died.
- Did you bring presents?
- Presents?
- But you always bring presents.
- I've got them. Got them right here.
Thank you.
Well, here we go.
This one is for Lisa, and one for Steph.
And...
Oh, it can hang outside the
window and make nice sounds.
- I wanted a kitten...!
- A kitten?
Yes, kittens are so nice and warm and kind of smelly.
And you're nice, and warm and kind of smelly.
- There you go, you want to serve that?
- Yes, sounds good.
Alright, give me your plates.
Steph? Thank you.
So what was it like too see each other again?
It was a great relief.
- How are things here?
- All good. The girls have been amazing.
Haven't you guys? Except you.
I saw mom's picture on the internet.
- Steph was crying.
- I wasn't crying!
You know your mom is made of very though stuff.
And she always makes it through.
- That's one. It's one of my best work.
- It's delicious love.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- I've got this lecture tomorrow.
I need to prepare.
Marcus?
Is there someone else?
No!
Wait.
I need time. I was in an explosion.
That's the thing, isn't it?
What the hell were you doing out there?
- Why were you in that place?
- What?
You said you loved me because
I had passion, I had fire.
That's why you wanted to live with me.
Do you have any idea what it's
like to wait for that call?
I have been waiting for that call ever
since I met you, I've just been...
I've been preparing.
Over and over and over...
And just getting ready.
You know, get up in the middle of the night.
Get on a plane.
Go to some god forsaken place.
And then I find you, and I identify your body.
And I take you home.
Tell the kids.
I watch Lisa crumble to pieces and I...
try not to let Steph disappear inside herself.
I'm not going back to that life again. I can't.
I can't live with you anymore.
You will stay until you're well and then...
I don't know.
At last the host of key leaders
came together to put their names...
...to the latest plan to bring peace
and stability in the war ravished...
...Democratic Republic of Congo.
It was certainly a grand setting for the signing.
Hey, I brought some lunch.
- Hey.
- Oh, you look like shit.
I look like shit? I was blown up by a bomb.
There you have it.
Well, that is who you are. You hang
around in war zones. You seem to need it.
The world needs to see the suffering,
the pain, what's going on...
You do it for the excitement and the danger.
And that's why you're great.
Look, we've already claimed you as Irish.
"Rebecca Thomas from Dublin."
People care, Becca, you should appreciate that.
Cut the bullshit please.
I would kill for that publicity!
What were you doing there, anyway?
Are you going back?
- Can I get you something?
- I'm fine.
Sure, you're fine. Just a punctured
lung close to death. No biggie.
It's good to see you.
Seriously though, any long, bright corridors? Angels?
A labyrinth, a beauty.
But you came back.
How is Steph?
I don't know.
- I should pick her up from school.
- Oh, not today. You don't need to.
She needs some time, Becca, just...
- She has after school club today.
- You do not have to be super mom today.
I can be there in time for four, so I should be going.
She doesn't... She doesn't have that club anymore.
She has a rehearsal. It's for an African project.
Ok.
Dammit. Sorry.
- Are you sure you're ok?
- I'm grand, I just wanted to pick you up.
But, I rode my bike to school.
That's alright...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Come on, tell me what's wrong.
I hope it was worth it.
The picture.
I hope it was worth it.
See you at home.
Good evening, and welcome to The Late Late Show.
First we have the swine flu
and then the coldest wind...
I'm not going back.
I'm not going back to war zones.
I don't believe you.
What else do you want me to do?
Rebecca.
Therapy, family counseling, what else?
I'll do whatever you want.
Just say something.
You come home, you...
You sleep, you rest, you wash your
clothes, you get rid of the smell...
and then you're happy. We're happy.
But all the time you're preparing,
you're getting ready to go back.
You're just waiting for that next shot.
No. I'm here now.
- Just like that?
- Just like that.
Hey mommy!
Put on your seatbelt.
- Hey.
- Hey Becca, you are big news here.
Talk about a big story, oh my god.
Now, do you have any pictures for me?
Becca...?
I'm quitting.
I'm not doing conflict anymore.
You just need some time off, you're just tired.
Is there anything, anything in the
world that we can do to help you out?
You are one of the top five photographers out there.
You can't just quit.
I have two kids.
And a husband.
Alright Jess. Bye.
Oh, sorry.
Mommy?
Hello.
- It was you who called, right?
- Yes, thank you very much for coming.
- What is it?
- It's a surprise.
- Oh my god! There are two?
- No.
- They are so cute.
- Yes.
The one you don't want is going to
another little girl who's waiting.
Which one do you want?
I want them both. I'm going to call
this one Happy and this one Lucky.
- No, you have to choose. 
- That's not fair, I want them both.
- That's silly.
- See who comes to you first.
Look, here is the one.
- Thank you.
- But i wanted them both.
Come on.
- Whats all this?
- Breakfast. Mom is home.
- What happened to the lunch boxes?
- Dad never makes us smoothies.
Shit, where is everything?
- Oh, mommy said a bad word.
- Shut up Lisa!
- You shut up!
- Both of you stop.
Steph, you're tired again. You have to go to bed early.
Are you not tired when you sleep on the sofa Daddy?
Eleanor O'Riley says when daddy sleeps
on the sofa, its never a good sign.
Come on, let's go.
Get your bags, we got to go.
- Ha, Tom.
- Hey, Rebecca.
- How are you doing?
- Good.
I wasn't sure if you'd be here.
I got something I want to show you.
Steph did these when you were
away, she left them at our house.
I wanted you to see them.
- That's her.
- She has a really special talent.
Really, really special.
Daddy.
Thank you.
Rebecca Thomas?
Can I just get your signature there?
Just a quick signature.
Just there.
Thanks.
How are you?
We're doing this project about Africa, at school.
And someone in my class found
this really awful picture.
A picture you've taken.
Which one?
It's Mary.
She was kidnapped by a group of
rebel soldiers called the IRA.
They cut her lips and ears to frighten her people.
They raped women, and killed civilians...
and forced children to be either
soldiers or... sex slaves.
How old are they, when they're forced to do that?
The youngest I have seen was... nine.
I was in Congo, and the world was
more interested in Paris Hilton...
...with no knickers on, than
what was happening in the world.
It just made me... furious.
- Was that taken in Congo?
- Yes.
On the road of Futaki in the middle of the gold mines.
And this man... There's another one as well.
He was executed by the land militia.
He was horrifically tortured before being killed.
I don't get it. Why are they doing this?
For money, multinational co-operations
and the mining companies...
have incredible deals with many
of the governments in Africa.
They are raping those nations of
their natural resources and wealth.
And none of that money gets passed back into
the country to enhanced the infrastructure.
You know a lot of hospitals have been burnt down.
Medical supplies, stolen by the military.
And the lack of access to medication...
Five million people died. Since when?... 1998.
It's the highest number of dead people
in any war since the Second World War.
Can I use these pictures for my project?
For your project? Yes, of course.
I can call someone who has lots of
documentation for your African project.
You want that? You can share it with
your class as well, if you want?
Yeah, some African books about dance and rituals.
Run away!
Get away! Move!
Run away!
Hey!
Becca?
Rebecca, what are you doing here?
- Stig? I can't believe it.
- Hey. How are you?
Good to see you!
What are you doing here? Where
are you working these days?
- I'm back home.
- Ok.
- I'm not covering conflicts anymore.
- Well, that's great.
I'm starting as Program Coordinator for
the Norwegian Refugee Council in Kenya.
They need someone who can cover their
response at the Kakuma refugee complex.
- I'm sure, you'll find someone.
- This is a non conflict area.
- So that's safe?
- Steph, my daughter.
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.
Is this place safe?
In Kenya there are some problems,
but Kakuma is completely Ok.
Thanks for the offer... I'll see you when I see you.
Well, the offer stands, so call me when you decide.
That's great, you guys had fun?
Yes.
A guy wanted mom to go to Kenya.
Photographing refugee camps.
He asked if I wanted to go, and I said no.
- Imagine going to Kina...
- It's Kenya.
- That's what I said.
- No one is going to Kina.
The guy said it was safe, we could go together.
- Like a mom-and-daughter thing.
- No, it's out of the question.
But that would be just perfect for my project.
It's exactly what i'm writing about.
And it's safe.
It's a lot rougher than you
imagine, and it's not a holiday.
Yeah, Ok, I know that.
But, think about the amount of
attention it would get in school...
We need family time now, just all of us together.
Why do you have to decide everything?
- I don't decide evelything...
- Yes, you do.
- You don't want us to go, do you?
- Your mom has just been in an explosion.
- But I just told you that it's safe.
- Safe?
Yeah, it's safe!
Why don't you want me and mom to do something together?
I just don't understand it.
Of course I want you to do something together.
It's not that long ago that you were scared
to death when your mother was on assignment.
Shut up, I'm not like that anymore.
No, I see that.
Hey, where are you going?
I'm taking Lisa's class down to the beach.
- Anyone likes crabs?
- Yes!
- You want to eat some live, raw crabs?
- Yes!
You're animals, oh my god!
Alright, here we have Harvey.
- Say hello to Harvey.
- Hi!
And this is Walther.
Walther is bigger, but there are
something else that is quite different.
- That one is dead.
- That's true. Is there anything else?
- The claws! That one has more!
- That's true.
This is what is known as a mutation.
- What's your job?
- My Dad is a marine biologist.
That's right, anyone know what that is?
Yeah.
They look at fish.
Look at fish.
- Like crabs and stuff.
- Yeah, that's true.
One of the things that I study
out here in The Irish Sea..
is that I go out with my colleagues and we
search for something called Technetium 99.
Which is a radioactive material.
It's waste basically from...
from a plant called the Sellafield plant, It's a
nuclear plant which is just across the sea in England.
We look for traces of plutonium,
anyone heard of plutonium before?
Me!
- I don't know.
- You don't know. That's alright.
Plutonium is a man made radioactive metal
which stays the same forever and ever.
So we can't get rid of it. And that's a problem.
- And we don't know what causes these mutations but...
- Can I eat it?
If you can eat it? No, you don't want to eat this.
- Are you bored now?
- Yes!
Alright kids, anyone ready for a crab race?
Alright, come over here.
Everybody clap.
Oh, thank you. That's nice.
He's always tearing strips off
Paul for getting in late.
Discipline is Ok, but God... teachers
shouldn't bother their pupils.
Sixth class got that women fired for
being so hopeless, do you remember that?
It's ridiculous.
All teachers do is talk, about responsibility,
How can an eight year old be that responsible?
Isn't that what teachers are supposed to do?
Teach the kids?
Well, that depends.
It depends on what level you are talking.
What's wrong?
I should shut up, I'm not good at this.
- At What?
- Life. Being normal.
What's that? The coffee mornings with
your friends? All the chit chat?
I don't know how you do it. Maybe I'm crazy.
Well, that has already been
established you just don't know it.
- What?
- "What?"
Becca, there is no easy way to say this...
- But we are not going to publish your photos.
- What?
You are kidding! What do you mean?
The Pentagon is furious about the recent publication...
...of that young marine dying in an
IED-strike by an embedded photographer.
Indirectly it does, hugely.
The editor has been told, that though we
are not beholden to any embedded rule...
...the Pentagon considers your photos
to be glamorizing suicide bombers.
Oh fuck, I can't believe.
If we publish, this will mean
that they will close down...
...all our future embedded access
as well as doors in Washington.
This is totally hypocritical,
it's worse, it's blackmail.
Becca, believe me, trust me, this is not
my decision but they have told me...
...that this is the decision, and it is not negotiable.
So, those pictures are not going to be seen?
Is that what you're saying?
Jess, you got to convince them, go to the
editor, whatever. You've done it before.
I take pictures of what I see, don't you understand?
Publish those pictures! Tell me you will!
I'm gonna have to get back to you, I'm sorry.
Anyway, I'm done. As I said, I'm done.
What exactly happened in Kabul?
I don't understand Rebecca, why would
you put yourself in harm's way?
I wasn't thinking, it doesn't work like that.
It's just, instinct.
You push, push, push.
I wasn't even scared.
The worst thing is...
I took two more shots from outside the car.
I don't know why.
The police saw me, and while they
were arguing with the driver...
I can't remember... I just saw people and poof.
She detonated the bomb. That's how I remember.
It's all my fault.
You think because of you, she sat the bomb off?
Yes, at that particular place,
at that particular time...
that those particular people died, yes.
I'd like to say a few words.
I'm not going to make a speech.
Now, look... It's been quite a year.
The progress on the whole plutonium
management, is a breakthrough.
- And I'm really proud of you. Even you John.
- I'm proud of you, too.
Thank you boss!
These last few weeks, they have
been challenging, to say the least.
You've been brilliant, thank you.
Cheers!
I'm just googling you.
I had no idea...
You have such an eye. Look at this.
- Seeing such terrible things, Rebecca, do you...
- Trust me.
Anytime i try to talk about my job
it ruins the meal. I'm done with it.
- What do you mean? You're not quitting are you?
- You are a brilliant photographer.
Has Marcus been putting pressure on you?
Now, sometimes it's harder to stay at home.
The one who stays at home has the hardest job.
That's what i mean.
I think you should carry on. Better
than your pictures of fishes anyway.
Can't use a tripod underwater. It
will just float to the surface...
What are you doing?
Come on!
Come on.
I think you and Steph should go to Kenya.
It's a great opportunity, she wants
so badly to go, you want it.
And she needs her mother.
Marcus...
Let's go for a swim.
I didn't mean it, are you crazy?
I'm kidding.
Come on!
- You must look after Lucky.
- I don't have anything else to do...
- ...and Daddy.
- I thought you weren't going away again.
Just for a few days.
When I come back, we can go on a trip together.
Yeah, I want to go to Australia.
They've got platypuses.
Or to the zoo?
- You take care now.
- I will.
You can have this one, if you like?
Really?
Thanks.
One of the largest humanitarian crises
is happening right here in Kenya.
There are over one million displaced people.
Many of the children are orphans.
Night.
Why did you start taking pictures of war?
Anger.
I was really pissed off when I was younger.
Photography was my salvation.
I could express my feelings.
It calmed me down.
Are you still angry?
Oh yes, but I have learnt to
live with it, work with it.
What do you mean?
When you are in front of all this...
horror...
the suffering.
I want people to choke on their
coffee when they open their paper...
and see and feel and react.
That's what I want.
You know, Steph? You give me hope.
Good night.
Good night.
If you want to film, just click here.
And then you try to stay still while you watch.
Exactly.
Rebecca, we have to leave soon.
They've seen some people outside the
camp, which might make some trouble.
I thought this place was safe?
It's been some tension between
different clans lately. So...
i give you 10-15 minutes and
then we have to leave, Ok?
Steph
Rebecca, we have to go, now.
Steph come, now, now.
Right away, please.
Come.
Rebecca, now! Rebecca!
Get in!
- Take Steph back to the camp now, I'm staying here.
- No, mom, just get in, please!
Trust me, it'll will be fine, Ok?
You go back with Stig.
You'll be in a safe place
and I'll see you there.
Trust me, it's Ok, it's Ok.
Mom!
Listen to me! I'm responsible for your
safety, get back in the car with us now.
I'll take responsibility for my own safety.
Now, i know exactly what i'm doing.
You take my daughter out of here. Please!
- Rebecca, please!
- Let me go!
The camp is not protected. Where is the
protection for this place and these people?
We are doing everything we can.
How can the UN allow this to happen?
They're not protected. They need protection.
I've been saying so to UN for the
last year, and i will do so again.
- But we are no use dead Rebecca.
- I need to send these pictures right away to New York.
You must promise me, never
ever, to do that again!
I need to send these pictures!
Steph?
Steph?
- I'm so sorry that you got scared.
- I wasn't scared.
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired.
They're sending in more security.
There is power in your pictures.
Don't say anything to Dad.
About yesterday.
Ok.
But we will talk about it.
We have to...
Just don't tell him anything.
Please.
- Did you bring me a present?
- Of course I brought you a present.
- Mommy, Lucky is gone.
- Oh, we'll find him.
- Oh no!
- Mine is burning as well.
It's bad.
Oh, come on.
You burnt yours, oh my god, that's just so bad.
Go away.
Come on, you can have some fun,
it's Ok to have some fun, it's Ok.
Here kitty, kitty, come on kitty, kitty.
Come here.
When I find her I'll never let her out again.
You have to dare to let her out again.
But she is so little, she wouldn't make
it out there by herself. I wouldn't.
Cats have nine lives, did you know that?
Maybe that way.
There is something wrong with Steph.
What?
I don't know.
Can we talk about what happened in Africa?
No.
I think it's time for me to talk to your father.
No.
How are you getting on with your pictures? Can I look?
That's nice.
Rebecca, we have to go now.
Right away, now. Steph
come, now, now.
We're going, now.
Rebecca, now!
Rebecca! Get in the car!
Is everything Ok?
Steph?
Come back. Steph.
Rebecca, now! Get in the car!
Get in!
- Take Steph back to the camp now. I'm staying here.
- No, Mom. Just get in...
You go back with Stig, you'll be in a safe place.
I'll meet you there. Ok?
Mom!
Trust me, it's Ok, it's Ok, it's Ok.
What the hell is this? It isn't
really what it looks like.
Listen, Steph was never...
It went all perfectly right,
and Steph was in safe hands.
Steph and I have already talked this through.
 Steph? Steph?
- Steph?
- Marcus.
Steph?
She was absolutely fine. Stig was with
her, and I was never in any real danger.
I said I'm sorry, I can say it again: Sorry.
Of course I wouldn't want that to happen again.
Marcus.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Marcus?
I want this shit out of my house.
And I want you out of my house.
You smell this? It's death.
You smell like death, Rebecca.
Lisa, go and find Steph, find Steph and go inside.
You are scaring her.
What?
I scare her?
These kids live in constant fear
that their mother is gonna die.
And I scare her?!
You don't have to be scared, it will be alright.
Would you like to go for a drive
until Daddy has calmed down a bit?
- No, go away.
- Come, let's go buy ice cream.
- What about the zoo? Do you want to go to the zoo?
- No, I have to pee...
Hold on to it, just get in. You'll be safe.
Come in, come in, come in Steph. Get in.
Stop.
What are you...? Rebecca, open the door.
Rebecca, stop this, open the door.
Don't do this.
Please open the door. Steph, open the door.
Please, look at them, open
the door, for God's sake!
Open the door.
Thanks.
I worry about you.
Becca, you are a really, really good mother.
Hello?
Hi Mom.
Let's go inside, Lisa.
Lisa?
Steph? Can I have a word with you?
It's important.
Please.
I love you and again I'm sorry for happened,
I made a big mistake.
Ok.
Is that it? No.
Someday when you have grown up and
you've found out who you are...
you will understand that there are
some things you can do nothing about.
Things you have inside you.
I started something out there
that I can not walk away from.
I have to find a way to finish it.
When will it be finished?
I've made a big mess of our lives.
I hope one day, you'll be able to forgive me.
It would actually be easier if you were dead.
Then we could all just be sad together.
Once and for all.
Steph...
Hey, Becca, it's Jessica.
There has been a lot of change here.
We are reconsidering publishing your photos.
But we need more pictures of their
activity to tell the story.
The group is on the verge of breaking up.
So we need you to go back out
there before it's too late.
What do you say?
Next, please.
Madam.
Hello, where too?
Istanbul and Kabul.
Okey.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what i said.
Where are you?
Are you coming?
Thank you very much for coming. I think we
are going to have a really great evening.
Drogba shows that through football
everyone can go a long way.
Even though they come from a poor country. Thank you.
And now we're going to have Steph, who's going to give
us a presentation about a recent trip she made.
Thank you.
I recently visited a camp in Kenya with my mother.
She's a photographer.
She goes to places where there are problems.
Places that the rest of the world
doesn't really care about.
She goes there to take pictures.
I went with her to this refugee camp
in Kenya, on the border of Sudan.
People live in this place.
Five thousand more arrive every month.
Many of them are orphan children.
At the start I thought it was odd to go
to people and take pictures of them...
especially when they were sad.
But then I understood.
They wanted it.
But no matter how many pictures
you take, it's not enough.
Someone has to keep taking more.
That someone happens to be my mom.
When we were there, there was a fight.
Mom got me to safety, and then she
risked her own life to take this photo.
I think about the kids who go through this every day.
They need her more than I do.
Thank you.
Can you open the door?
- Have you brought presents?
- No, I haven't been away working.
- Where have you been, then?
- I have been by myself a bit.
What was that like?
It felt lonely.
I think it's time to go to sleep.
- Are you going to sleep here tonight?
- No, I don't think so.
- You will always be my mommy.
- Yes. Always.
You stay with Dad. Ok?
I'll come and see you very soon,
spend time with you and Steph.
- Night.
- Good night.
Did you come back, just to say goodbye?
Yes.
Are you scared?
Yes.
But that's Ok.
Lisa says we have the bravest mom in the whole world.
Because you go swimming in the ocean all year.
I love you.
Be well.
Good night.
It's nice here.
Yeah, it's nice.
Be careful, alright?
You have to stop this. Stop it!
