MAN OF IRON
Hope exists if someone believes
the earth is not a dream...
but a living body...
and that sight; touch and
hearing do not lie.
And that everything
I have found here...
is like a garden; viewed from
outside the garden gate.
You cannot enter; yet it exists.
If we looked with more
wisdom and care...
we'd see a new flower
or many a star...
in the garden of the world.
Some say that the eye deceives;
that there's nothing there...
that it's just imagination.
But it's they who've
lost all hope.
They think that when a person
turns around...
the world behind him
ceases to exist...
as if stolen by a thief.
All right?
I'll do it again.
The censors will cut it out.
- Maybe they won't notice.
- Milosz?
They've got butter and strikes
on their minds right now.
- The coast has stopped dead.
- Just like your program will.
- You're on soon.
- I'll make it.
You've got four women.
They have to be prepared.
Will they take it off?
Skin and all.
I don't understand.
We're out of time.
That was great; thanks.
We go on in a moment; so let's
go over it once again.
Women's groups' representatives...
express their great concern...
over the unjustified work
interruptions.
Tell him about the buses...
and charging by the head
for rides.
I walked 20 kilometers!
I don't understand the municipal
transport workers.
I ought to remind
the strikers...
That's not how it was
supposed to be.
Excuse me.
To remind the drivers...
those arbitrarily stopping work;
that we've got problems.
Car owners are charging an arm
and a leg for rides to work.
Now about the bananas.
Thank you.
...that ships are docked at port
while the bananas are rotting.
We're talking about vitamins
for children.
Phone call.
Polish wives and mothers
appeal to you...
get back to work.
It's urgent.
- What is it?
- They want something.
- Tell him.
- The boss wants to see you.
The big boss.
Make sure you pay your
cafeteria tab.
- Is it going to be that bad?
- I don't know.
Mundek; take my place here;
I'm begging you.
- Who called?
- They're sending a car.
- The first deputy.
- You ought to comb your hair.
A dark blue Fiat 132.
Good luck.

Please wait here.
This is Mr. Winkel.
- Wait here and have a drink.
- No thanks; liver problems...
All the characters in this film
are fictional...
but are presented in a context of
events which actually happened.
A certain number of authentic
quotes have also been used.
- Everything's set.
- I'm glad.
These materials are for you.
Equipment.
Money; quite a bit of it.
Sign here.
This all stays between us;
right Mr. Winkel?
Mr. Winkel?
I'm your driver.
Please come with me.
Excuse me; are you...?
No; never mind.
We're at the Gdansk shipyard.
The date is August 20; 1981 .
Maciej Tomczyk was the first to
call for a strike.
Please tell us how it began.
We came to work normally on the
morning of the fourteenth...
three of us; my two buddies and I.
We agreed earlier that it would
start on the fourteenth.
We had 7 posters prepared...
and 1500 leaflets.
I took 800 of them myself.
I went into the section...
and put a poster in the window...
and left the leaflets
in the changing room.
I asked the guys again if they
were going to join...
because I wanted to know.
They said they were...
because we had to demand
Anna's reinstatement.
They'd fired her.
They tore down my poster; this is
where I pasted it...
Reinstate Anna Walentynowicz...
plus a pay raise with an
inflation allowance.
So then I told the guys...
we were going to Section K-3;
and they started off.
The truth is; nobody knew
what was going to happen.
But like I say; they started off.
20-30 of us went out;
1 70 stayed behind.
We headed for K-3.
I took our poster out
of the window.
Waiting for us there;
all prepared...
were these signs on sticks.
So I stuck the poster on the sign
and went to the directors' offices.
A crowd started to gather; people
on the ships were looking at us.
Other sections were looking too;
because K-3 had made a move.
Personnel people ran up to us
asking what was going on.
We told them we'd talk later.
At the directors' building; a small
crowd was waiting for Walesa.
We elected our strike committee.
That took till 10 or 1 1 a.m.
The group kept getting bigger and
then we marched to the shipyard.
There were lots of people
who joined us.
When we got back to the offices;
Walesa jumped over the fence.
He'd joined us; that meant
everything was all right.
Walesa came over; said a few words
because we aren't any good at that.
He said he'd been fired after
working there ten years.
"You all know me..." he said and
told people what it was all about.
That's the guy who started the
strike at the shipyard.
Maciej Tomczyk.
A bastard.
But one with a peculiar lineage.
- Want to see it again?
- No; I don't need to.
His father was also a striker
ten years ago.
Thus we have a beautiful tradition
of counterrevolutionary activity.
Why are you giving this back?
These materials are for you.
For the work you're going to do.
I don't quite understand.
Winkel...
when it starts; we're going to
nail Tomczyk's ass.
A legend will be born;
which we'll have to...
destroy.
Your reportage will help
us do that.
I'm no reporter.
I wonder why they chose you.
Not a bad idea.
I never would've thought of it.
You know who got you out in '71?
No.
- I did.
- I never knew.
You didn't know me then;
but I knew you.
Please sign for the car.
The strike committee has banned
the sale of alcohol.
Prohibition.
But we manage somehow.
Here; it'll come in handy.
They issue bans; but sober Poles
can never reach an agreement.
In Warsaw; they're not aware of the
seriousness of the situation.
All they do is screw up.
There aren't any sensible people
here in Gdansk; nothing but wimps.
They'd sooner get in bed with
the strike committee.
The fundamental axiom is:
we're not going to share power!
You know what...?
This a counterrevolution;
that's what it is.
We have to derive a wedge
into the shipyard.
What can I do; a small person with
a small tape recorder?
You can do a lot; I know you...
We'll divide them; get them
out in the streets.
I know what I'm talking about!
This thing isn't over yet!
Warsaw has to understand that
we have to act now.
If we don't straighten this out;
you-know-who will do it for us.
And where'll that leave us?
Let's convince Warsaw this is
about a mortal threat.
Got any ideas?
Yes.
We have to impress on them that
this is very dangerous.
We'll lead the riffraff
out into the streets.
- Like we did ten years ago.
- They might not come.
They'll come out all right.
What if we got rid of Tomczyk?
Then there'd be an explosion;
a confrontation and fuc...
Call an ambulance!
...take it easy.
The director's had these attacks
often since losing his job.
I was afraid he'd...
I think you're pretty brave.
To come here now!
I don't understand.
The real danger is you can end up
on the shit lists of both sides.
What do you mean?
You dislike workers that much?
Me?
Look...
It'll start soon.
Oh well.
I warned you.
We have a reservation
for a Mr. Winkel.
That's right.
Your ID please.
Room 1303.
The tank's full; just in case.
Which means?
Tonight should be quiet; but
tomorrow might not be.
- Excuse me.
- Come in.
This is room 1303; Mr. Winkel.
Close the door.
What is it?
No; nothing.
I'll spare you the fairy tale that
I'm a policeman only here as...
a specialist in eating shit.
The authorities must be hard and
not have any illusions.
The Comrades at the top have
screwed everything up.
Here's Tomczyk and some others
from his circle.
There's a lot to choose from.
Maciek Tomczyk.
Alcoholic; psychiatric hospital.
Diagnosed...
Has problems with his
heart and liver.
Really?
Why the fuck is that in here?!
Not important.
Acts of hooliganism...
Supposedly a worker;
but his mother...
owns a villa in Zakopane
and supports him.
Assault on a police officer;
dealing in hard currencies...
violating social rules.
Vandalizing his dorm day room.
That's his wife.
I know her.
She's in jail now.
I guess it's not her.
Yes; it is.
She made a film about Birkut
from the fifties.
You'll get to see it.
Here's my phone number.
Prepare a script I can use for
a television news report.
We'll shoot the film footage
ourselves in a few hours.
When you're ready;
please call me.
I suggest you interview
her first.
Tomczyk's wife; it'll give you
an overall picture.
You'll get a pass.
Look over these materials;
but keep an eye on them.
No one will admit to knowing you
if you're discovered.
These days you have to be on
one side or the other.
Sign here.
Here too.
Here's your pass.
Better not go in the shipyard.
Our protection doesn't go that far.
Good-bye.
...it would be a mistake to think
that the strikes at the shipyard...
and other work places in the
Tri-City area...
are the results of activities of
people who are against socialism...
that they arose from sources
foreign to the working class...
and hostile to the
People's Republic.
During the strike;
despite its broad extent...
The workers have not exhibited any
organized ambitions...
or measures aimed against the
People's authorities...
the nation's political system
or any of our allies.
This assessment cannot be affected
by any speeches...
made by anyone from the outside...
from dissident circles...
which desired to take advantage of
the confusion...
but were met with resistance on
the part of the workers.
Increasing numbers of work crews
joined the strike...
and the solidarity among
striking crews spread.
Residents of the area; including
political parties; feel that...
only responsible dialog
can lead to...
a breakthrough in the impasse...
and to the resumption of work
by the strikers.
Of all the political means
at our disposal...
it is currently the most important
and may be the most effective.
The regional executive committee
has expressed such a view...
from the very beginning and
continues to try and realize it.
Hello sweetheart.
I'm looking for a bottle...
- There a prohibition on.
- I understand.
I'll be nice and quiet;
straight to my room...
A ban's a ban.
Nobody cares about...
- I said it clearly; didn't I?
- Who banned it?
The Strike Committee.
This is a hotel; not the shipyard.
The ban's not on here.
I know better.
You can stop right now.
Operator; good evening.
- I'd like to call Warsaw; please.
- You must be new in town.
We can't connect to any
city in Poland.
- A blockade?
- That's right.
But a telegram or a telex
ought to get through.
Please notify the reception desk
that I'll be staying.
Certainly.
Goodnight sir.
Let us pray for our
country's leaders.
Let us pray that they show wisdom
in their talks with the strikers.
Let us pray...
that in resolving the problems they
consider what's best for Poland.
Hail Mary; full of grace;
the Lord is with thee...
What have trade unions given us?
Twelve years of work
without a vacation!
Workers don't deserve them!
Only those in the office!
A pair of children's tights
costs 80 to 90 zlotys.
How can we get by?
Rent-700; preschool-700...
How much do we earn?
I'm sure there are exceptions;
wealthy people.
I get 1000 per person for
clothing and food.
For that I can only buy
bread and margarine.
Those at the top and those at the
bottom both have to eat.
We're all the same.
They know that today workers aren't
ignoramuses from the 18th century.
People have gone to school; evening
classes; part-time...
and still they try to keep
them in the dark.
They could back the dumb ones;
not the well-informed...
not those who understand that
people know what's going on.
Our trade unions are just for
hushing things up.
What we need...
are completely new people
chosen by the workers...
who must tell us...
what the situation really is.
Which union official is going to
stand up to the director?
With a word; he can
blow them away.
You know whose memory we're
commemorating with this cross.
You know what happened here
in December of 1970.
For those killed in that massacre;
let us pray for eternal rest.
In the name of the Father;
Son and Holy Spirit.
Grant them eternal rest; oh Lord...
and may the everlasting light shine
upon them; forever and ever; Amen.
You don't remember me; do you?
Ten years ago you helped me get
a job at the radio station.
- Dzidek!
- That's right.
Dear friends; do not pick those up;
do not read them!
He'll never make it; he can't
handle it; he's too edgy.
Maciek Tomczyk.
Really?
- How do you know him?
- We went to college together.
I'll tell you all about it
over coffee.
- Are you still at the station?
- Sort of.
Don't pick those up!
- I haven't heard you on the air.
- I maintain the equipment.
- How is it?
- Little equipment; little work.
I turn out bullshit
pieces in Warsaw.
- If they're like those you once...
- Times have changed.
I don't know because I don't listen
to our radio; it hurts my ears.
How about some coffee and cognac?
Let me show you something...
for old time's sake.
The order imposing police curfew.
December 15; 1970.
Occupational strike.
We demand freedom of speech!
We'll strike until we win!
Hands off the shipyard!
No killing; just
lower prices!
Do away with the moldy old
governing elite!
Shipyard workers; maintain
peace and order!
We are strong when united.
Stay vigilant!
This ought to be shown non-stop...
to all workers in Poland...
so they'd have no more illusions.
It gotten to the point now...
that they either have to crush them
or recognize them.
You think the authorities will
go for recognition?
Independent trade unions?
The right to strike?
What about the Party's
cradle-to-grave monopoly?
They'll still have the
monopoly on vodka.
I'm sorry.
Want a drink?
You bet.
Take advantage of it; this is
the last bottle in the city.
The shipyard's banned
the sale of alcohol...
and so it isn't sold.
It's a little warm.
Were you in the same
year as Tomczyk?
Not the same year; but
in the same dorm.
I'd met him in night school.
He was difficult.
Unfriendly?
Just the opposite; but
very secretive.
Especially after the student
strikes of 1968.
He took part in those?
He took a beating;
like we all did.
I was black and blue for a month
from the truncheons.
There's still some left...
It really is warm.
What was it about?
His father.
His father worked at the shipyard.
Actually; he was his
illegitimate son.
I know; father Birkut;
son Tomczyk.
Exactly.
His father used to be well known;
then slipped out of sight.
Just the opposite of Maciek.
They didn't get on very well.
Because he was illegitimate?
Mr. Winkel; it's the
20th century!
That wasn't it.
Back then; in March of '68; the
workers didn't join us.
Maciek begged his father to get the
shipyard to make a move.
But his father was like a rock.
He claimed it was provocation.
Dad; it's started!
You forgot to close the door.
It's started!
No; Maciek.
I'll tell you myself
when it starts.
The whole country...
Mr. Birkut;
all the universities...
You have to move the shipyard;
you have to support us!
- All the universities...
- I know.
It's the day of reckoning.
We're going to the school.
Maciek's not going.
You can do as you please.
He's staying here.
Calm down.
They're beating us.
And they'll beat you more.
You have no right...
Dzidek; show him your back!
No need to.
I've had a bruised back too.
- Not bruised enough!
- What conclusion did you draw?
To sit on your ass?!
Maciek; calm down!
Look; we're trying to
move things here!
They're using you to move things.
They're fighting for positions.
The deck's being re-shuffled.
They're doing it using your hands
and you're going along like sheep.
Calling it provocation let's you
wash your hands of it!
Fine.
Maybe you're right; but if
the workers...
came out of the shipyard...
Stop it; Dzidek!
Don't waste your breath.
The secret police let you start it;
but they'll finish it.
Don't mix the workers in this.
- Will they go?
- Yes.
When the time comes.
When will that be?
No lie can last forever.
Don't let yourselves be
drawn into their game.
But this is about our lives!
How do you know it's not now?
How can you be so sure?
You're afraid!
You don't give a shit about
anything except your job!
You don't give a fuck about Poland!
Your kind are to blame for this.
Stop it; Maciek; calm down!
When it really starts;
we'll go together.
Not now.
We're not going anywhere together!
We're finished!
Two years later; when the shipyard
workers took to the streets...
we said; "Go by yourselves."
They walked past our dorm and
urged us to join them.
But this time we were tough.
Students...
this is your fight too.
Your friends are still serving
jail sentences...
for March '68.
Together; we can free them.
Now we can work together.
March won't repeat itself
if we go together.
Success depends on us; alone!
Enough oppression; violence
and lies!
Right the wrongs!
We are gathering today...
to fight together for
human rights!
Students...
I'm talking to you.
Will you join us?
We were all going nuts;
especially Maciek...
but we didn't join them.
I know.
Maybe it was good you didn't.
But I couldn't forget it
for a long time.
You still can't.
So we just sat there.
Shots were being fired.
Things were getting worse.
Then...
Get up; Maciek!
They've killed your father.
Where is he?
There; where they shot him.
- Couldn't you have...?
- There are tanks there.
- We have to go get him.
- We'll never get through.
Wait.
A scarf.
It's cold outside.
The crowd is carrying a body...
We can see the red and white flag.
The group with the corpse and flags
has reached Swietojanska Street.
In front are young people;
students.
They're headed for the Presidium;
taking the body to the shipyard.
There's a second group of young
people with something written...
"The blood of children."
I mean the group with the corpse.
It's reached the Presidium.
We have to get that body;
it's making an impact.
Have them take care of it.
There's a crowd gathering at
the city hospital.
It needs to be dispersed.
The corpse is lying on the sidewalk
near the Presidium.
All right; ten-four.
Where is he?
They've taken him.
- What?
- He's not there.
- Where was he?
- Next to the curb.
- Which side?
- Next to the curb.
- Where exactly?
- On the right.
There; next to the pole?
Not underneath the bridge?
- Maciek!
- Wait!
- He's not there!
- Forget it!
- They'll shoot you.
- I have to find him...
- He's not there.
- How do you know?!
And now the newly-elected head of
the Polish United Workers' Party...
First Secretary; Edward Gierek.
Comrades and citizens...
my fellow countrymen.
Earlier today; the Central
Committee...
of the Polish United
Workers' Party...
entrusted me with the duties of
First Secretary.
And so I turn to you in
the name of the Party...
I urgently appeal to...
Polish workers and to all
laboring people...
to draw conclusions from these
distressing occurrences.
I turn especially to you...
metal-workers; miners; steelworkers
and textile-workers...
No; no; no...
- He's got the right idea.
- I'm not buying it!
Maciek; look; this may be
our only chance!
It's all right.
Everything's taken care of.
Our friend had an attack.
Can he be discharged?
He could've been...
Thank you; nurse.
- He could've been the next day.
- But he was in shock.
That's the safe version.
Thank you.
No need to; I live here too.
Is he still in danger?
That depends on what you write on
the medical certificate.
We only verify how long
he stayed the hospital.
What was the diagnosis?
Could you say that in Polish?
Why?
He was here long enough;
it ought to suffice.
Does that mean that Maciek
is really ill?
From a psychiatric point of view;
there's nothing wrong.
Certainly no more than with
the rest of us.
But he has a bad heart and liver.
- He needs to take care of himself.
- I don't know if he can.
Then his problems will get worse.
Anything else?
No; thanks.
Tell me...
Why are you helping him?
It's not important.
- I'm not going back to college.
- What are you going to do?
- I'll go to the shipyard.
- What then?
Nothing.
- I'll work there.
- Where's the sense in that?
Where's the sense in college?
None for me.
I'll end up being an engineer...
and it'll only be worse for me.
Bullshit!...Why?
I'll have more to lose.
I see; you plan to
mortify yourself.
No.
- I want to be free.
- Why?
So I can choose.
I want to understand the things
my father said and did.
What a pretentious idea!
You'll just waste your life!
Maybe.
Listen...
Can I ask you to do something?
Whatever you want.
Fuck off!
And did you fuck off?
I'm out of cigarettes.
Some guy gave me these
Moroccan ones.
- Can you smoke in here?
- Not really; but...
Getting back to Maciek;
he disappeared.
Where'd he go?
I don't know but he came back a
year later not saying a word.
I met him one day...
Maciek!...Hi!
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
I'm working at the shipyard.
I was in the army.
We've all graduated.
When; last year?
I can't find work.
Remember Krysiek?
Or that stunt with the TV?
They ended up putting you
in a straitjacket.
You guys really fixed me!
You know what; I sent a telegram
to the First Secretary...
congratulating him.
Hang on...
I'll read it to you.
Look...
On the occasion of being named
First Secretary of the...
Party's Central Committee;
congratulations and...
best wishes for success in
your difficult work...
from a young engineer.
Good; yeah; it's good.
Really?
What...?
Wear it here.
Weirdo.
- So he never graduated?
- No.
He worked in the shipyard; later on
he became a foreman.
- Then they threw him out.
- Because of his father?
I don't think so.
Different name; different shipyard.
He disappeared from sight.
Why are you so interested?
Shit; these are strong!
I don't know the guy; but I think
he's playing some sort of game.
I wrote about his father in 1970;
maybe I'll write about him now.
Yeah; I'll be right there.
- Excuse me...
- No; my fault...
We won't let you in until radio
and television stop lying.
I don't answer for all the media;
only for myself!
Start telling the truth about the
strike and you'll get in.
Mr. Tomczyk is busy.
Does he know I'm here?
This is the third day.
- They're meeting around the clock.
- I'll only be a minute.
I can't.
- I'm his mother.
- We don't let family in.
A mother has a right...
Look at all the mothers out here.
So you never saw him again;
never helped him?
I tried; but he sent the letters
back and wouldn't take the money.
Finally I stopped writing.
Everyone would have.
I accepted the thought that
I no longer had a son.
Now I see he's just
like his father.
All I want now is
for him to live.
Because they'll kill him; just like
they killed his father.
This is the strike's eighth day;
aren't you tired yet?
Could we have a word
with you; please?
We're drafting a statement in
the name of all reporters...
You want me to sign it?
First; I need to know what it says.
Let me read it to you.
We; Polish reporters; declare...
that information about the strike;
and the manner it is presented...
fails to convey the sense of events
which leads to disinformation.
The communication blockade and
publication ban...
have had a dire effect and made it
impossible to do our jobs honestly.
Most people think we're a bunch of
bastards and liars.
It's only a simple gesture.
Overall it's fine; but
a little fuzzy.
Signing any old thing is popular
nowadays; but not me.
We understand you may
have your reasons.
Hold on; that's not it.
Someone's waiting for me...
- There's a lot of signatures.
- There'll be more.
I always like to know what
I'm signing; that's all.
...has been well accepted
by the public.
Why is that?
It was our joint participation
in presenting the views...
contained in the Regional
Committee's Executive Report.
In my opinion; it was possible...
thanks to the long-term; direct
contacts with workers in the area.
We tried to convey the
objective truth...
and to understand everything...
which had provoked the authentic
protests of the working class.
A similar conflict in 1970
ended tragically.
Is there a chance that this time
things will be different?
I'm absolutely convinced of it.
All of us see the opportunity
and we're trying...
to react quickly in addressing
those problems...
which have not yet been resolved.
I can't imagine a repeat of
the earlier situation.
That one cost us too much.
It can't be like it was...
resolving conflicts using
other methods.
It can only be dialog;
agreement...
- See; there's hope.
- Yeah; sure!
- Who's that?
- The regional Secretary.
- Fiszbach?
- They're going to talk.
They talked once before.
Only blood stains will remain.
That would mean civil war.
With today's weapons; the massacre
would last an hour.
- The shipyard's not alone.
- People will get tired.
And then...
- You were looking for me?
- I have something.
...provide media access to
all religions.
Allow those fired for participating
in the strike...
to return to work...
and reinstate students expelled
for their political beliefs.
Publish information about the
strike committee's start...
and its demands.
To take genuine steps to
resolve the crisis.
To provide reliable information
about society and the economy.
To allow all groups...
to participate in the debate
about a reform program.
To pay people for the
strike period...
the same as for vacation.
To increase wages...
/ have no time for you now...
your mother hasn't seen
you for ages...
wait a bit longer until
you grow up...
and we'll tell of these events.
Of these hopeful days...
full of hard talks and disputes...
of these sleepless nights...
and of our hearts which
beat ever faster.
Of these people who finally felt...
who felt at home at last...
fighting as one for today...
and tomorrow for you too.
So don't be sad and wait
a bit longer...
until you're back in our arms
once again...
- in our home which didn't eXist...
- The projector's falling apart.
- What is it?
- The film broke.
- Can you handle it?
- Yeah.
...because there was never
happiness in it.
Please don't tell anyone
what you saw.
- Is it going to last much longer?
- I don't know; they'll negotiate.
- Jagielski will outtalk them.
- I doubt it.
They've got 400 plants behind them;
that's real strength.
You sound as if they'd bought you.
Stop kidding around or it'll
get back to the boss.
- Which way?
- Straight.
- Does this grandma...
- Mrs. Hulewicz.
She's agreed to talk to you.
She's seen a lot.
Everyone around here's seen a lot.
So what?
That's your opinion.
A full-blooded reporter...
I'm not full-blooded;
I'm a mongrel.
Besides; it isn't up to me.
It depends on my boss...
my boss's bosses; they're the ones
who make the program.
They don't do it alone.
Skip the morality lesson; OK?
Her daughter is right in the
eye of the cyclone.
Maybe we ought to turn back.
I don't like natural disasters.
She can arrange a pass for you.
Into the shipyard?
I didn't sit at home in 1970.
If it wasn't for my legs; I'd be
at the shipyard today...
with the boys and with my daughter.
You want to write about Maciek?
Yes; again.
So you wrote about his father?
Agnieszka wanted to make
a film about him...
but what good's a film to him
in that other world?
From what I know; he died
leading a protest march.
That's not true.
I'll tell you how it was.
I was there.
I was on my way to work...
he was walking along when
I heard shots.
People hid for cover...
wherever they could; but he
kept on walking.
I called out to him; but he kept
on; not looking around.
I called out again; because the
shots were closer.
I could see his back...
He walked straight into the firing;
as if he were seeking death.
I didn't tell his daughter
any of this.
I did the right thing; didn't I?
You see...
all this has become unbearable.
But I'll tell you something else.
You must write this down so that
people remember.
So they don't forget.
How they treated those
poor dead people!
After all; a dead person is sacred!
There were so many of them!
I was looking for Mateusz.
All we could see were their feet;
with these name tags...
tied to their toes.
I recognized Mateusz
by his smashed toe.
A beam had fallen on it once.
It's him!
We forgot his shoes.
What are you doing?
Here...
Be careful.
Just a reminder; not a word
to anyone.
I can't forget how
they treated...
such an honest; such
a good man...
like a dog.
Make sure you write that down
so it's remembered.
Then they tamped down the grave
and told us to leave...
because there'd be others
coming after us.
They told us not to tell
anyone about it.
I can't bear it any longer.
How much must we suffer?!
No; not here.
Oh God; it was right here!
Of course.
Just a month ago...
Jozefa Jasinska...
What's going on?
We buried him right here!
The grave was here!
Where's the cemetery caretaker?
But the grave was here!
So they made a nice iron cross
at the shipyard...
and Maciek placed it
near the bridge...
where his father was killed.
Maciek said that...
they had come to power because
of people's misery...
and to hold on to it; they wanted
to sweep everything away...
without a trace.
And what about that Gierek?
I even trusted him.
Such a strapping man;
such a calm person.
People had hope; but it
turned out...
he wasn't fully informed.
What are you daydreaming about?
Get to work!
They'll return from the yard soon.
It's time we cooked supper;
it's getting dark!
My daughter...
and her friends said it made no
sense to go it alone...
that we had to act together.
That's when free trade unions
were formed at the shipyard.
My daughter joined the movement
with her heart and soul.
She tried to convince him;
but he wouldn't.
He felt bitter...
because when he had tried to
convince them in June...
they hadn't listened to him.
I told our guys to wait in the
changing room after work.
Have some of your men come too.
I'm not sure what we ought to do.
Petitions haven't done a thing.
Maybe a solidarity strike.
And hope the press
writes the truth.
How can we harm them?
Now they're beating them; then us!
This isn't about bread and butter.
The whole country is looking at us!
We're the only ones who can
defend them now.
We're only demanding what
Gierek promised us!
- We could harm them.
- Stop saying that!
You wouldn't believe the things
going on in Radom.
If we don't do anything...
they'll think we're
totally scared.
Their marches; propaganda;
it turns out...
that all our sacrifices
were unnecessary.
We have an official
right to demand...
the right and even the
responsibility.
All we'll do is harm them.
We can't just sit by
doing nothing.
- They cancelled the price hikes.
- But they're beating people!
We've done our part.
I know life and that revolts
only bring trouble.
People like you only stir things up
by raising hopes for change.
Their families suffer afterward.
We'll never change anything.
My father didn't die so that
we'd let them beat others.
You know what I want?
My kids to not to be orphans.
I want to live normally
and work as usual.
You mean slave!
Maybe so; but to live
as long as I can.
Your revolts won't
change a thing.
You know why?
Because students and workers
always act alone.
When we moved; they held back; now
they're moving and we're scared.
We'll always lose this way.
Don't insult us;
nobody's afraid.
People can think for themselves
and won't be provoked.
Let's wait.
They rolled back the price hikes.
- That's not what unions are for.
-What then?
Other people take care of
workers' vacations!
You protect the interests
of workers.
But not of hooligans.
What hooligans?
Is that what they wrote about us?
So price hikes didn't effect us?
This is your last chance.
Someone else will support
them if you don't.
I don't know who; but this
is your last chance...
to come out of this with honor and
then disband afterwards.
- You won't disband us.
- You never know.
Don't get into any trouble; because
I'm not going to protect you.
What trouble?
Whose side are you on?
Who elected you and why?
- Protect me from what?
- From getting fired.
I hadn't told you earlier;
but now I'm warning you.
Is it the big money or the power
that's made you stupid?
Why should they fire me?
Do I work badly; drink; steal?
They gave me an award; and now you
say they want to fire me?
Don't tell me about it!
It's not your work that counts.
What then?
Stop stirring things up.
I don't need to spell it out; do I?
Don't take it so seriously.
As the shop council;
you'll defend me.
No one's going to stick their neck
out for a troublemaker.
You won't support us over
Radom and Ursus?
We'll call a march to
condemn your actions.
Oh Maciek...
it's awful what they've
done to you.
I had to take a tranquilizer to
give you this pink slip...
and I really am very sorry.
Why are you doing this?
Otherwise they'd fire me.
Then someone else would
give it to you.
But if they refused too;
then eventually...
- They can't fire everybody.
- I have some money for you.
Please sign this.
All right; fine.
You'd better count it.
Good-bye.
- Counted?
- Sure.
Agnieszka will tell you he rest;
after they let her out.
She's being held in jail now;
like so many others.
You asked me what I thought
of all this.
We are going to win.
If not now; then next time.
I've been reading a lot lately
because I've had some time.
Agnieszka and Maciek
brought me books...
about the history of Poland.
There were a lot of good
things written there.
There must be justice.
That written about in those
constitutions and other laws.
At least that kind.
- Will you write the truth?
- Has Maciek won already?
You act the cynic; but you ought to
stay till the end.
Which one?
- You'll write a great story.
- And print it underground?
You know more than reporters from
Paris Match; Der Spiegel...
Please use it.
- But I haven't been inside yet.
- You will.
- By climbing over the fence?
- You'll get a pass.
Mr. Winkel?
Hello; please come with me.
My mother told me about you.
Opinions about you
are divided.
How's that?
Many people don't want
to see you in here.
You represent an exceptionally
deceitful institution.
What do you think?
I think you ought to come in.
- They say I inspire trust.
- I not so sure of that.
I think you journalists
need to be helped.
If you spend time with us; maybe
you'll feel pangs of conscience.
After all; you're Poles and
this is now Poland.
- Lofty words.
- It's the truth.
His father came here prepared;
already formed...
but Maciek had to be forged.
- Shaped like a piece of metal.
- And you forged him?
He was forged by life in Poland;
as it used to be.
Which is hopefully
ending forever.
Because they'd reintroduced beating
during investigations...
he decided to protest on his own.
- Introduce me to him.
- When they release him.
They'll release him someday.
Maybe he won't want
to talk to us.
- Does it make sense?
- Doesn't it?
You wrote; "To the People's
Government; stop beating workers."
So it was an appeal to
the authorities.
- Did the authorities listen?
- People read it.
- How many posters were there?
- Five.
- How many read them?
- I don't know.
Let's say 100; maybe.
What does he want from me?
To do a profit and loss
calculation.
What am l; an accountant?
100 read it; 3 months in jail.
Good balance?
- I'll improve it.
- Not much.
I'll take gasoline and burn down
the Regional Committee.
- You're stupid.
- Didn't you burn things?
That was a long time ago.
We don't burn theirs anymore;
we set up our own.
You want to decide for others and
that makes no sense!
People are lazy and
they're afraid!
You can't do it for them; they
must do it themselves.
I'm going to work alone too;
just for myself.
Let them lock me up;
beat me; kill me!
- Your father thought differently.
- Because he was stupid!
All right; maybe not stupid;
but naive as a child.
He allowed himself to be
deceived; like always.
He believed Kociolek and went to
work; urging others to do so too.
And people were killed
because of him.
It was father's fault
they died!
Maciek; you can't say that.
You can't; you don't need to.
So what's going to happen?
The government will change and
we'll sign an agreement.
Soon.
You'll be there.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it...
please adopt the attitude
you had ten years ago.
You're talented; just
a little lost...
like everyone in the media.
You'll get the best pass.
You'll be in the conference room
and witness the historic moment...
- when it arrives.
- If it arrives.
I hope you find yourself
in the new Poland.
Let us pray for all
the strikers.
May the Virgin Mary
watch over us...
and give us strength
and comfort.
Let us pray to Jesus Christ
that he may help us...
solve all our problems.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee...
Winkel...
/'m waiting downstairs
in the restaurant.
Wrong number.
- Excuse me; what time is it?
- Time for your meeting.
Let's go; please.
The bags stay here.
We'll keep an eye on them.
Our firm is poor; but solid.
Good evening.
I was taking a nap...
Sit down.
Why's everybody scared shitless?
You're shaking like a leaf!
DTs; huh.
No way!
Prohibition.
Don't worry; soon things
will get back to normal.
Give your liver a break.
Nasty stuff...
Tell me what you've got and
let's have the material.
I've got a lot; but it
needs some work.
It should take a couple of days...
Mr. Winkel; this isn't
a live broadcast...
and I don't give a shit about
your witty answers.
Have you gotten inside?
Where?
Inside the gate.
- It's not that easy.
- Stop evading the issue!
Or else we'll get pissed off
and you'll catch hell.
- Do you have a contact?
- Yes.
We broadcast in two days.
But what can I do...?
- Editing alone...
- Editing?
Editing is not your concern.
You're to get inside the gate
and bring out materials.
You know what the boss wants.
People from the rear echelon.
Tomczyk.
What rear echelon?
They don't have one.
Are you sure?
You'll soon find out that there are
always enemies of socialism...
hidden in the rear ranks feeding
off the emotions of the workers.
How do I get a film crew in there?
Only foreigners are let in.
Mr. Winkel...
if I could get in there myself;
I wouldn't ask you...
nor pay for this hotel.
I don't want any part of this!
What are you doing;
forcing me?
- I'm not a...
- What?
An informer!
Oh really?
Who do you think you are;
you little shit?
- You signed; didn't you?
- What?
The car; the money; personal files.
We have receipts.
Don't make waves when you're
neck-deep in shit!
Well then; see you in two days.
Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Well?
You've got fifteen minutes.
- But captain Wirski...
- He's not my superior.
I have a wife and kids.
Wirski's caused me trouble
in the past.
I was even hauled into court...
She won't tell you anything.
She's tough.
All right; come on.
We'Il; they've got us
both locked up...hi.
I sent you the message because...
I didn't understand a thing.
I didn't know if you
remembered me...
or if you even wanted
to talk to me.
How'd you get in?
I have my ways.
- Who told you about me?
- Old Mrs. Hulewicz.
She remembered my articles
from 1970...
which got me thrown out
of the station.
You can trust me or not.
You must know one thing...
The situation's not bad.
Is this place bugged?
Probably.
They're going on the offensive.
Who is?
You have too many friends
who believe in tanks.
- They'll never give in.
- Yes they will.
- This system won't last.
- Yes it will.
I've gotten into a bit of trouble
over that Tomczyk of yours.
They're preparing a provocation.
They want him to be
a scapegoat.
They have proof he's contacted
Radio Free Europe; the CIA...
Informer; agitator; whoremonger;
an alcoholic...
Isn't that a bit much?
What do they want?
Second echelon people.
First too; I suppose.
- Have you seen him?
- Yes.
He was making a speech.
Marvelous; congratulations.
Has he lost weight?
I bet they're not sleeping at all.
He looked miserable; but
very sure of himself.
Maciek never did run afoul
of the law.
Did he serve time?
The authorities break the law;
making arrests without grounds.
Believe it or not...
I want to write the real
truth about him.
Call it expiation or opportunism;
it doesn't matter.
I'm asking for your help;
for information...
about his life; his work
and his plans.
Did the president send you.
In a sense.
I'm collecting materials.
Just in case.
You don't have to insult me.
After all; not everyone in
television should be guillotined.
Almost everyone.
Not in my opinion.
I'm sure of that.
The situation dictates people's...
That's a comfortable theory; except
that workers don't subscribe to it.
- They have nothing to lose.
- That's what Maciek always said.
Got a cigarette?
I gave it up when I was pregnant;
but sometimes I really want one...
- Did Mrs. Hulewicz help you?
- I spoke to her for half a day.
I haven't smoked for a long time.
- You've changed.
- I'm calmer now.
I've calmed down.
I was very ambitious once.
I wanted to win at all costs.
Maciek was surprised at me.
He was older than me;
so he understood.
He felt sorry for me.
It's a different life
here on the coast.
You don't have to choose between
success and virtue.
Despite the lack of perspectives;
you're more relaxed...
with no need to be two-faced.
You can say what you think...
do what you want and what
you think is right.
And then there's my child!
You knew me back then.
I never thought that
I wanted a child.
But; you know how it is...
you meet a man...
and he's the one you want
to have it with.
I don't regret my choice.
Do you believe me?
Yes; I do.
Maciek tried to convince me to
return to making films.
Life here; being an activist;
means civil death.
You are beyond the law; even
though you don't break it.
Sometimes it's very hard.
But when you get used to it;
it can be fun sometimes.
Yes.
There are these amusing
situations.
And you meet and work with
wonderful people.
You enjoy fooling undercover cops.
The really nice thing is not
being afraid of anything.
Even in the slammer you know at
least they can't lock you up.
Exactly.
How'd you get by?
You know what it was like.
I came here the first time...
Iooking for Birkut; not knowing
that he was already dead.
Maciek...
was working as a welder
at the shipyard then.
I didn't know the police had
jailed and beaten him.
I had explored the 50s and never
really seen the present.
I had no idea of the conditions
Polish workers worked in.
I'll tell you how a welder works
in the double hull of a ship.
You needn't; I've been a reporter
for 16 years.
Without it; you won't understand.
It's what's most important.
I met Maciek outside
the shipyard.
He told me how his
father had died.
Hoping it would help;
I took him to Warsaw.
You know what happened?
- The boss will be right back.
- We'll wait.
What's he doing?
Hello; it's me again.
This is Maciek Tomczyk;
Mateusz Birkut's son.
- Well?
- Nice to meet you.
Stop fooling around.
I need a camera; film and a crew.
- What for?
- So I can finish my film.
- Where's the hero?
- You'll find out when you see it.
- I'd rather know now.
- You'll miss the emotional impact.
- But I'll get information.
- Fine; but please stand up.
This must be heard with respect.
So where's your father?
He died in Gdynia in 1970.
What are you saying?
The police killed him.
He hasn't got a grave; but his film
will tell his life story.
Would you please excuse us?
Hold on!
What are you conniving here?
Would you give us a moment?
All right.
Have you gone nuts?
You're dragging out the situation
on the coast now?!
- You wanted a conclusion.
- What kind?
You want to erect a statue to a guy
who's an enemy of the State?
That's being blind and
irresponsible!
- The Party denounced the massacre.
- Six years ago!
Now there's Radom; Ursus; committee
buildings being burned...
and you want me to canonize Birkut?
You must be crazy!
We have to repay that debt...
Just a minute...
You attended elementary
school for free.
- In high school; your parents...
- Didn't pay a thing!
You education at Film School
cost the state...
A million zlotys and that's the
debt you have to repay!
Not work against the country that
has invested so much in you!
Now please go outside...
and tell that person that this film
will have to wait...
that we may return to it and
he can be a consultant.
Do it skillfully so he
doesn't feel bitter...
I'm going to make this film!
I don't know how; who cares?!
It can even be slides!
Really?!
- Do you have your pass?
- Yes.
- Let me have it.
- Why?
I just want to see it.
You no longer have a pass.
And you'll never enter this
building again!
Furthermore; I'll talk to
management...
and fix it so you'll never
work in film again.
They'll take care of it...
on a level so high; you can't
even imagine.
My advice now is to
start looking...
for a new occupation.
There are so many professions!
I hope you choose well.
You son of a bitch!
Good-bye.
Come on.
Hi!
- How's the film?
- Forget it!
I found his son.
Welcome...
You resemble him..
Mr. Winkel did the story
on your father.
- Why'd you cover up his murder?
- I didn't want to scare you off.
They pulled my film.
Where'd he go?
So that's how things are!
Let's get out of here.
Come with me to Gdansk.
Are you crazy?
I'm serious.
You've got a camera.
You'll meet my father's friends.
You'll shoot photographs...
of people; places...
Then we'll put on an exhibit.
Where?
My place; I have a big room.
We'll hang lots of pictures.
Come on.
Good evening.
May I have a word with you?
- Please sit down.
- Thanks; I'd rather stand.
What is it?
You know...
we could've called into the office;
but the boss sent me...
because maybe we can make a deal
and there won't be any problem.
- What problem?
- You've made trouble before.
- We don't want a repeat.
- Over what?
Over these; Mr. Tomczyk!
Could you be more clear?
Isn't it clear?
Why are you introducing her...
to enemies of the
People's Republic?
Why are you visiting places that
ought to be forgotten?
You keep clicking and clicking!
What's the point?
- Who's he?
- Personnel manager.
What personnel manager?
I just work in the office.
Well; this lady's a photographer.
That's not true.
You only finished film school.
Anyone can take photographs!
Sure; but depends what of.
You want to put on an exhibit; but
you need a permit to do that.
I can display whatever I want
in my own home.
Of course; as long as it's legal.
The law also allows us to move you
to a worse job.
Oh yeah; how?
Even the worst; so bad as
to be unprofitable.
- You know what this is called?
- Who cares?
I have a proposition.
You burn all this...
and you don't need to
report to personnel.
Otherwise it's the sledgehammer.
The decision's been made.
Think about it; folks.
Tell us your decision tomorrow.
Good-bye.
- What are you doing?
- Don't you understand yet?
Don't you see they moved in
before we even got started?
We don't have a chance!
- There'll be an exhibit.
- Titled; "December's Victims."
- We'll invite our friends.
- Then they'll fire you.
Then I'll hand out leaflets
protesting it.
Listen...
you know what'll happen?
It's a downward slope.
You know what's at the bottom?
After all; he was my father.
Hush; hush...
I was devastated.
It was then we spent our
first night together.
I still didn't understand.
It wasn't it; yet.
We were both embarrassed.
I considered it a passing
vacation fling.
But as I got to know him; I saw
he was the kind of person...
you just can't leave.
Besides; he told me alone
a lot about himself.
He's so...
I can't explain it.
One time; I wanted to leave him and
try picking things up...
again in Warsaw.
I packed my things; said good-bye
and thought I'd never return.
You fool!
Why didn't you tell me?
To that moment; I hadn't thought
it was possible...
that he was treating me seriously;
not as a pretentious egoist...
who was completely unreal.
But when he told me that
he loved me...
I can't describe it to you.
- What are you doing?
- Calling the shipyard.
Extension 157 please.
This is Agnieszka.
Can I speak to Maciek Tomczyk?
...the list of shipyard workers
fired after 1976.
Can you guarantee the security...
of strikers...
and that others won't
be persecuted?
Shouldn't we expect
false witnesses...
and sham trials...
accusing the Strike Committee
of being a band of criminals?
Mr. Premier; members of the
High Commission; this is...
the basic issue...
will the country be a police state
or a democracy?
We don't want national unity forced
on us with police truncheons.
- That's sheer demagoguery.
- Perhaps...
but people with different political
beliefs continue to be arrested.
We have a list and none of them
have been charged with a crime.
Perhaps they've been jailed because
their views aren't "correct."
I'll be glad to give you this list.
You used a word which
I found offensive.
How can you talk of guarantees
that strikers will not be...
I hesitate to repeat the word; not
be considered "criminals?"
I feel personally hurt.
After all; I'm treating you
as honest people.
Could anyone call those present
here; criminals?
Mr. Premier; I've received threats
of personal harm...
In that case you ought to
throw me out of here too.
Mr. Premier...
If an old schoolteacher has to
attend a church far from home...
so that her principal
doesn't find out...
This can't possibly work.
Agnieszka...
They disconnected it?
Give me a cigarette.
Your last one?
That's OK.
What was I talking about...?
God damn it!
What?
We then started to meet; to openly
criticize the system.
- Then he started to conspire?
- Conspire?
- Work in the free trade union.
- Say what you mean; then.
There weren't any free
trade unions yet.
We read the constitution...
and we knew our activities
were completely legal.
But then...
then something funny happened.
Maciek asked me to marry him.
Actually; he asked if I'd marry
an unemployed worker.
Then the wedding.
I'd never been religious; my
parents used to drag me to church.
As long as I lived at home.
But with Maciek; I knew that it had
to be a church wedding...
that it was necessary; essential.
May almighty God grant
you his blessings.
May He bless you and your children.
May the Son of God aid you in good
days and difficult moments.
May almighty God bless all those
present here...
in the name of the Father; Son
and Holy Spirit.
Best wishes to you both.
All the best to you; Maciek.
Best wishes as you go down this
serious road in life.
I think you will indeed
take it seriously...
and remember you can always count
on us in times of need.
Since this is a democratic union;
I'll share these democratically...
I'm not here because
I was littering.
I can answer for what I was
really arrested for.
Taking part in forming the free
trade unions...
and organizing celebrations to
honor the victims of December; '70.
But not for littering!
That's ridiculous.
Besides; people picked up all the
leaflets so there was no litter.
It isn't much; Agnieszka; but
everyone in the section chipped in.
We'll do a collection
every month...
for as long as Maciek's in jail.
I can't accept this.
I'll manage somehow.
You can't refuse it!
Maciek would take it.
It's not charity; it's our
show of solidarity.
Please take it.
All right...
We'll be going then.
- Where's the baby?
- Come have a look.
People began to know more; they
were able to read more too.
These things were talked
about more often.
What happened next...?
We moved in with Mrs. Hulewska.
Soon afterward; it really started.
Hands off the baby!
Let's go.
Good-bye.
Where'd you go?
I was no secret; one of them
got on the train too...
and they knew.
I went to my father's.
The baby's still there.
- Is that where they nabbed you?
- No.
The shipyard was still working; but
it was getting hot in the country.
When the strike began; I wanted
to be with Maciek.
I boarded a train and that's
when they got me.
What can they do to you?
Nothing.
They've already lost.
If not?
Then we'll keep playing.
You know what Birkut
told Maciek in '68?
No lie can last forever.
Have they beaten you?
They don't beat political
prisoners anymore.
Afraid?
Yeah; no matter what happens
I'll get my ass beat.
I still want to know about free
trade unions and distribution...
- See you at the shipyard.
- Bye...
- Did you get anything out of her?
- A little.
You think they might win?
Good-bye.
Take off your shoes!
You were supposed to call.
Mind if I smoke?
In here?!
I still need 2-3 days.
Do you have to smoke?
You need to take up a sport!
I don't have enough good
material yet...
All right; I won't smoke.
What I gave you earlier was thanks
to a certain arrangement.
But that arrangement
may end tomorrow.
I think I will smoke...
Do what you like...
A person becomes boorish hanging
around people like that.
We can't lay a finger on them
without orders.
But we're ready.
You need to take up a sport!
Those files didn't
contain enough...
for your little screenplay.
Watch it!
But thanks to you I met some
wonderful people!
Remember a certain night
near Malkinia.
Who; drunk; ran into a wagon;
killing the horses...
and wounding the driver?
Were you charged then?
No.
You also have a file like that;
you little shit!
Your shoes!
Arrest me; kill me; but leave me
the hell alone!
Can I use the phone?
- It's to Warsaw.
- Go ahead.
- It's tapped.
- No big deal.
Secretary's office.
Hello; Winkel here.
I'd like to talk to the boss.
- He's not in.
- I'll leave a message then.
Yes; from me; as follows:
I resign.
I guess I'm too old.
The shipyard has won
and all I can do...
is wish them well.
Which boss am I to
give this to?
- I don't understand.
- You don't listen to the radio.
Nobody here listens.
The old bosses are gone.
We have new management.
Should I pass the message along?
Just tell them I quit.
It really wasn't easy.
Negotiations were hard; tough...
but they concerned very
important issues.
I confirm and stand by that
which was said.
We spoke as Poles ought to
speak to one another.
I can confirm one other thing.
There are no winners
and losers here.
I believe deeply that this will
stand as testimony...
to our patriotic and
citizenly intentions...
to serve; as well as we can...
the interests of working people;
of our nation...
and of our socialistic homeland.
The documents; please...
so we may sign them.
I said we'd win the first day; and
that's the way it's happened!
I'm the last one out.
God bless; I'm going to work.
I can't believe it!
We did it!
You needn't hide this anymore.
Now; please leave.
It's not like that!
We know about everything.
This man told us.
I can explain everything!
At least say farewell.
We already have.
Mr. Winkel...
Why are you so worried?
This agreement is meaningless.
The law doesn't recognize
agreements made under duress.
It's only a piece of paper.
I wanted to tell you
that we won.
That we got what we wanted in '68
and what you wanted in '70.
Now I know for sure we'll never let
them to divide us again...
never allow them to deceive us.
We made it through the worst.
Forgive my lack of
faith in you...
but it all still seems
like a dream to me.
But it's the truth.
We've all seen it and nothing
can change that now.
I hope that you are
proud of me now.
Actually; that's everything
I wanted to tell you.
To boys who came from all over,
today the police used guns.
We stood so bravely, aiming gamely.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
They bore his body on Swietojanska
against the cops and the tanks.
Shipyard boys avenge his death.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
Gas is now part of the attacks,
blows rain down on workers backs.
Children and women are falling too.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
Starring
One is wounded, another killed,
winter's dawn, blood was spilled.
The state is shooting at workers.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
Shipyard workers across the country
go home the fight is over.
The world learned but is silent.
Jacek Wisniewski fell.
Don't cry mothers, you must know
the yard has a flag with a red bow.
For bread, freedom and Poland.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
Sincere thanks to all those whose
help was priceless during the...
production of this film.
