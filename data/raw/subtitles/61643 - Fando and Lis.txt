Once upon a time...
a long, long time ago...
there was a mystical city, Tar.
And at that time...
all the cities were intact...
and flourishing.
Because the final war
had not yet begun.
When the great catastrophe
occurred...
all the cities crumbled...
except Tar.
Tar still exists.
If you know where to look for it,
you will find it.
And when you get there...
you will be presented
with wine and water...
and play with a gramophone.
When you get there,
you will help harvest grapes...
and you will pick up scorpions
hidden under white rocks.
When you get there...
you will know eternity.
You'll see a bird
that drinks one drop of water...
from the ocean
every hundred years.
When you get there,
you'll understand life...
and you'll become a cat, phoenix,
swan, elephant, baby and an old man.
You'll be alone and accompanied.
You'll love and be loved,
sharing the same space...
and yours will be
the seal of seals.
As you approach the future,
you'll find...
Ecstasy.
It will overwhelm you
and never abandon you.
The Tree Sought Refuge
In The Leaf
Let's play.
Okay, I'm a famous pianist.
If you're a famous pianist,
and I cut off your arm...
then what will you do?
I'll become a famous painter.
And if I cut off the other one,
what will you do?
I'll become a famous dancer.
And if I cut off your legs,
then what?
Then I'll become
a famous singer.
And if I cut off your head,
then what?
Once dead, my skin will
become a beautiful drum.
What if I burn the drum?
I will become a cloud
and take on any shape.
And if the cloud dissolves,
what then?
I will become rain and produce
a harvest of wars!
You win.
I'm going to miss you
when you're gone.
If you ever feel too lonely...
search for
the magical city of Tar.
To Tar...To Tar...
So close and yet so far
To Tar...To Tar...
So close and yet so far
What a misfortune
to be paralyzed.
It doesn't matter
if you're paralyzed.
I'll take you everywhere.
How kind, Fando.
Fando, remember your letters
when I was in the hospital?
I felt so special when
I received such long letters.
They were so tender.
And when you had
nothing else to say...
you sent me newspaper clippings
to keep me from being alone.
How happy I was!
The tree disguised itself
as a leaf, the house as a door...
and the city as a house.
The same scene
over and over.
The tree became a leaf,
the house a door...
and the city a house.
It was hard to see all that
and not seek refuge in my hands.
Leave him alone!
Let me show you my world.
Come, follow him. Enter.
Sign here!
You'll stay here forever.
Here's the contract!
We'll run strings through
your hands and feet
Here. All this money,
it's yours.
Let me do that.
Let me go.
I can't remember anything.
I don't know what's wrong.
Please stay here with me.
What matters is where
the wind comes from.
No, what matters is
where wind goes to.
No, what matters
is sleeping.
You're worrying about things
that aren't important!
But this is important!
Who do you think you are
to say what's important.
Look.
What a cute little girl.
What are you doing down there?
No! No!
Lay down with us.
Get away from me!
Let go!
Ha-ha. Look at her.
She can't move.
Nice legs.
Fando.
Hey!
Thanks for entertaining us.
When you're in the city of Tar,
you'll know love...
and you'll ride on a horse
with a falcon on your shoulder.
When you're there,you'll never
see snow on the streets.
And you won't die...alone.
I will die
And no one will remember me
I will die
And no one
will remember me
Yes, Lis. I'll remember you.
I'll visit your grave
with a flower and a dog.
And at your funeral,
I'll sing in a lowvoice...
'' How beautiful is a funeral.''
How beautiful is a funeral
How beautiful is a funeral
I'll visit your grave
With a flower and a dog
With a flower and a dog
Do you really love me, Fando?
Yes, Lis.
I don't want you to die.
End of the First Chant
And Tar Was Inside His Head
Is this the right way?
Let's see.
We're here.
To advance a mile,
we only have to take a step.
If Tar doesn't exist,
we can invent it.
You're right.
Lis, I want to do a world
of things for you.
How many?
As many as I can.
Then you have to fight
for life.
But, Lis,
I don't know why I should.
And if I knew, I don't think
I'd have the strength.
And if I had it, I don't know
what good it would do anyway.
Try harder, Fando.
Everything seems so difficult,
but you always have an answer.
No, not always.
Sometimes I pretend
to have one.
But this isn't a game, Lis.
Yes, Fando.
I know it's no game.
There's no way out.
I think that's enough for now.
Hey! Come this way!
Ouch, it hurts.
You want to know who that is?
She's a beautiful child.
Is this the way to Tar?
If you think it is,
then it is.
This is the way to Tar!
Look around.
There and there.
You'll see
there's no day or night.
When you hear the beat
of an immense drum...
it'll be night.
Now those who sleep
will get up and walk.
Here, try some.
It stinks!
-I'll put you in.
-No, I can't.
I know you can't walk,
but you can stand up.
Don't leave me here, Fando.
Good-bye!
Come back, Fando.
Look how scared you are.
I am coming to get you.
Did you see that?
I'll buy you a boat
when we get to Tar...
and take it on the river.
Can you imagine, Lis?
Yes, Fando.
And I'll try to
cure your sickness.
I don't want to see you suffer.
I want to have many children.
You're the best, Fando.
Do you want to hear
a beautiful fable?
Like the one about a man
and a paralyzed woman...
on a little cart,
and their journey to Tar.
Help me down, please.
Yes, Lis.
Look how beautiful it is here!
Do you like it?
Yes! I love it!
Look at the rocks!
Yes, Fando.
They're beautiful.
They're the most beautiful stones
I've ever seen.
Look at the flowers, Lis.
I don't see any, Fando.
It doesn't matter.
Look at them!
But there aren't any.
Don't cry.
I told you to look at
the damn flowers!
Yes, Fando. I'm sorry.
What a crybaby!
It's beautiful here with all
the flowers and trees.
Where do you see trees?
Right there on the path
by the flowers.
You're too heavy.
There are flowers but no trees!
Yes, there are
flowers and trees.
You're starting to be
a pain in the ass.
You're hurting me.
I'm sorry, Fando.
I wish I could walk.
You want to walk?
There! You still haven't
seen the flowers!
Have you? Have you?
Yes, I've seen them.
They're pretty, right?
Don't cry.
I'm not crying.
I'm sorry. Put me in the cart.
Fando, please.
I do so much for you,
and all you do is cry!
I'm sorry, Fando.
One of these days I'll leave.
No, Fando.
Please don't leave me.
I have no one but you.
I'm leaving!
I'll never see you again.
Faggot!
Father. No.
Father.
Father.
Father.
End of the Second Chant
The Solitary Man
Is Always Accompanied
You're so smart, Lis.
But what good is that
if you keep making me suffer?
No, Lis. I don't make you suffer.
On the contrary.
You're always telling me that.
But then you say you'll
chain me down...
so I can't move.
You make me cry.
Yes, Lis, you're right.
But I swear
I won't do it anymore.
You say you'll cure me
when we get to Tar...
but I don't
believe you anymore.
I know. Kiss me, Lis.
This time I promise it's true.
I believe you.
A little blood
for the love of God.
A bit of blood.
for the love of God.
Have mercy on this
poor blind man.
How nice of you.
Here, hold your arm out.
What about me?
Here you go, my son.
Lick it clean!
Have pity
on the poor blind man.
A bit of blood
for the love of God.
Kiss your mother. Come on.
She's about to die.
Here, my son. Eat!
Eat! You need to eat!
Eat!
Your mother will feed you
until you explode.
You'll explode,
but you'll be well fed.
Kiss your mom for the last time.
Do it.
I'm dying.
I don't have much time.
My admirers are waiting
to see me die.
I belong to my fans.
I dedicate my death to my fans.
I perish for you.
Bravo! Bravo!
She's the best.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
She's the best at dying.
What a performance.
Come and feel my body
getting cold.
I've got a piece!
This is my final gift.
Watch.
When I wanted to,
you couldn't.
When I didn't want to,
you could.
Father! Father!
Kill me, my son.
Good-bye. Thank you
for killing me.
Mama.
Careful. Watch your step.
Thank you...
Fando.
End of the Third Chant
And When I Wanted To Separate Myself
From Her...
She Told Me We Formed One Body
With Two Heads.
The feather was on the bed
The bed was on the feather
The feather, the feather...
The feather was on the bed
Look. She's pretty,
very pretty.
It's true she's very pretty.
Stupendous!
Don't be afraid, miss.
It's okay.
Her skin is so soft.
No fatty tissue.
It's truly magnificent.
Unique. Touch her all over.
Exceptional body tone.
The best of all
is when you kiss her.
Like this. Watch.
Caress her using both hands.
From head to toe.
Look at her beautiful toes.
And now, is she worthwhile?
Very much so.
Who is she?
She's my fianc√©e.
Hey! Don't leave like that!
Come back!
They're worthless!
All of them!
Don't cry.
I said don't cry!
You're the most useless girl
in the world! Get dressed!
To Tar...To Tar.
Off we go to Tar
Take me off the cart.
Fando, I don't feel well.
You don't want to die now,
do you?
I feel bad.
It seems like we're
still in the same place.
We haven't gone anywhere.
Once, my mother forced me
to lay down.
A priest made
a hole in my head...
and took out
the stone of madness.
Sick, sick, ill...
-To chew, to command.
-To love.
-To masturbate...
-Mama...
You always lie to me.
Are you going
to handcuff me now...
even though I'm chained
to the cart already?
No, I won't.
Kiss me, Lis.
You think you can fool me
with a kiss?
Whose mouth am I going to kiss?
Look at my drum.
How beautiful.
-Round and beautiful.
-Yes, round and beautiful.
I only need it
to sing you songs.
Sing the ''feather song.''
The feather was on the bed
The bed was on the feather
I love it. Once we're in Tar,
sing it to me all the time.
What did you take
from your pocket? Show me.
I knew it.
You want to put me
in handcuffs!
Don't try to deny it.
I knew it! I knew it!
I just want to play.
You've been playing all along.
No.
-Then get rid of them.
-No.
No, don't cry.
I love you.
Don't leave me, Fando.
I don't have anyone else.
-Oh, no, I won't leave you.
-Don't hurt me.
Hold me tight.
How cruel I am to you.
Give me your hands.
I said your hands.
I command you!
Damn, they're broken.
It's your fault!
The other hand! Now!
They're broken.
It's your fault.
Come here! Come here!
Crawl!
I can't go on...
My drum!
My drum!
You broke my drum!
You broke my drum!
No, Fando. I'm sorry.
Don't blame me.
Don't hate me.
Fando, don't hurt yourself!.
Don't hurt yourself, Fando!
When you arrive at Tar...
you'll wear a golden crown
upon your head.
And you'll possess the key...
that opens all the labyrinths.
I will die
And no one will remember me
No, Lis. I'll remember you.
I'll visit your grave
with a flower and a dog.
During your funeral, I'll sing...
'' How beautiful is a funeral.''
I'll do it for you, Lis.
Speak to me, Lis.
Speak to me, Lis.
When The Reflection
Faded Away In The Mirror...
It Gave Way
To The Word '' Freedom.''
