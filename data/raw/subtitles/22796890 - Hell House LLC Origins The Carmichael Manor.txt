The Carmichael Manor.
Where to begin?
The manor's history is as sordid
as the Carmichaels themselves.
You got this big mansion.
Rockland County, New York...
a county with its
own sordid history.
The Carmichael Manor was
something that fascinated me
as a true crime writer
for a long time.
They were an extremely
wealthy family.
I mean, their home
was deep in the woods,
totally remote
from civilization.
You had to drive literal miles
and miles down dirt roads
just to get to it.
And tragically, one
October morning,
the police discovered Catherine
and Eleanor Carmichael
both dead in their beds,
just horrifically murdered.
The obvious suspect is the
father, Arthur Carmichael.
What's the problem with that?
Well, he and the 20-year-old
son, Patrick Carmichael,
have been missing for
the last 30 years...
like, completely vanished.
But I think they leaned
heavily on Arthur
because there was
early snow that year,
and there's only one set of
footprints leaving the house.
Nothing coming in.
Most likely Arthur,
since Patrick only had
use of one arm at the time
after the car accident.
Earlier that same year,
Patrick and their
elder sister, Margaret,
were involved in a car crash,
which tragically
killed Margaret.
Patrick was driving
Margaret home from the city
when they were smashed
by a drunk driver.
Patrick ends up
surviving the accident,
just losing the use of one arm.
But Margaret was declared
dead at the scene.
The decades-old murder was
ripe for Reddit conspiracies,
Internet sleuth speculation.
The rumors that it was
haunted started very early on.
Carmichael Manor is
home to a grizzly murder
that occurred right
upstairs from where I stand
just one year ago.
Half the family murdered,
while the other half is still
missing, and still no answers.
Poor Tom Wheeler.
And he had to keep
doing takes after that.
And you can see how
all he wanted to do
was get the hell out of there.
Incidents like that fueled
the ghosts enthusiasts
over the years.
But outside family,
very few people were
ever granted permission
to stay in the home for an
extended period of time...
until Margot Bentley.
The last time that
I heard from Margot
was the day she drove out
to the Carmichael Manor.
Rebecca was with
her. She always was.
Five days later, I got a call
from a New York State
Police detective.
Their bodies had been
found in the manor.
The only known thing that
happened to Margot and Rebecca
was the 911 call that police
received at around 2:00 a.m.
And this was their fourth
night in the mansion.
Wait, wait. Wait. It's
working. It's working.
Hi. My name is
Rebecca Vickers.
We're Carmichael Manors,
at 101 Starlight Drive.
Please, something's
in the house with us.
Margot! It's not him!
Most keyboard detectives
stay in the comfort
of their own home.
That wasn't how
Margot did her work.
She was always there,
and she was always
recording everything.
What's on their
video is four nights
of completely perplexing and
unexplainable nights of footage.
Whoever sees this, that's the
best disclaimer I can give.
How much further? I'm
kinda getting hungry.
I told you a banana
wasn't gonna be filling.
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
Let's stop and eat.
Okay. Where would
you like to go?
I don't know. Do you
see a sign somewhere?
I... I would.
I would slaughter a
chicken right now.
Okay.
I will do what I
need to do 'cause...
- Wow.
- I'm at that point right now.
Survival mode.
- Spoons.
- Thank you for paying.
Why, uh, what's the
deal with the camera?
Oh, I'm so happy you asked.
Rebecca, will you hold
this for a second?
- Oh, God.
- Thank you.
So, actually, we are here...
are you okay with me on
camera for a few minutes?
Uh, what are we
gonna talk about?
So I actually created a website.
It's called netsleuths.com.
And we go investigate
these murder scenes.
And I have a question for you...
Oh, you're going
to the Carmichaels.
Yes! You knew it. You knew it.
Do you have any
opinions about it?
It's, uh, you know, it's
the local lore legend.
Everybody knows the
story of that place.
Okay.
You know, that they got
butchered in the bed,
or whatever the heck it was.
Yes! That's exactly it.
So, you're going
to check it out?
We're going to check it out.
We're gonna be
there for five days.
You're s... no, you're
staying in the Carmichael?
- We're staying inside.
- Yeah.
- Yes. We got permission.
- Is that crazy?
Wow, okay, yeah, we
used to like, party,
in their backyard and stuff,
'cause it's so remote...
like, back in high school,
'cause no cops
would go out there-
But we've... none
of us have actually
been inside of it.
- Wow.
All right, sleuthers.
We are about 30 minutes
from our new home
for the next five days...
the Carmichael Manor.
Yep.
And as you can tell,
Rebecca is as excited, as
always, for a road trip.
Mm.
I don't see why we can't stay
at a nearby hotel this time.
I'm... you can
still do your work,
and I can have
reliable Internet.
Yeah, but where's
the fun in that?
And hey, this place
does have Internet.
I promise.
Do you want my tomato?
- It better, okay?
Because I can't miss a
single meeting this week.
Oh, I know.
You'll murder me, too,
if you miss your
precious meetings.
Stop that.
Will you grab the camera?
- Yeah.
You ever been out
this way before?
Uh, to this specific area, no.
But I was in Rockland
County once as a kid.
Oh, is that the
thing with the...
Yeah.
Margot, how off-the-grid
is this place?
We've been driving on a dirt
road for, like, 20 minutes now.
Yeah, it's pretty remote.
Okay. Remote, right?
- Yeah.
- So remote.
And yet, it has Internet?
I'm starting to have doubts.
So, this is what happens
when you have no signal
and you don't know
how to read a map.
Let's go see.
Are you sure we're
still in North America?
Lemme just check really quick.
Yeah, no, that's
North American dirt.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.
- That is...
- Really nice.
Damn. How rich were
the Carmichaels?
And this is where we're staying?
Can you believe it?
So, do we just knock?
Yeah. I guess so.
Wait, wait, wait,
you do the filming,
I'm gonna do the talking.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Could definitely see a
horrific murder happening here.
Yeah, no kidding.
Hello?
Margot. Donald.
We spoke on the phone last week.
Yes. So nice to
meet you in person.
Nice to meet you, as well.
This is my girlfriend, Rebecca.
She's gonna be keeping me
company on this journey.
Great. I am very sorry. I
did not hear you pull in.
I have been trying to
get things ready in here.
Also, are you okay with being
on camera for a few minutes?
That's fine.
Oh, this.
That is the family portrait.
Eleanor had that
commissioned one year
before Margaret's death
in the, um, car accident.
Normally, we have a
third party come in,
and turn the place
around for us.
But we've had a
bit of a hard time
getting companies to
come out this far.
The house is pretty remote,
and, of course by
now, everyone knows.
Knows what?
Do members of the
family still use it?
Well, it's still in the
Carmichael family name.
It went to Eleanor's
family first,
after everything happened.
More recently, her
sister Beatrice.
Now, Beatrice is 83,
so, we basically look after
the whole estate for her.
I am sorry, by the way, about
all the time constraints.
Some of our estate overseers
just want this place
to be completely closed
off to the public.
Liability concerns.
Right now, short-term stays
are the middle ground.
You guys.
Thank you so much for
getting everyone to agree.
Five days is plenty.
Well, I told them
to give you 10 days.
I mean, truthfully, you
could have 20 if you wanted.
Really, nobody stays here
more than a few nights.
Oh God, Is it because
of the Internet?
Please don't say
it's the Internet.
No.
As I told Margot on the
phone, that is reliable.
I told you so.
What's this.
On the wall?
You can't hear anything,
but back in the day,
that would actually
buzz the kitchen,
when there was a full-time
staff working here.
Very "Downton Abbey."
Of course, you'll have
everything you need...
linens, food.
Which one of you likes coffee?
- Oh, me.
- I do.
Good. 'Cause we have plenty.
Believe it or not,
the entire house is pretty
much exactly as it was
in October of '89.
Nobody's really lived
here full-time since then.
This was Catherine's bedroom...
Arthur Carmichael's
youngest daughter.
She was only 17 when the
whole thing happened.
Apparently, she wanted
to be a filmmaker.
It was said that she was always
filming around the house,
capturing home movies
of some kind or another.
She might have had
a future in that.
Reports say her murder
was brutal, right?
Like, it had to be
a crime of rage.
And personal.
I consider myself lucky
I didn't see the
crime scene photos.
I can't even imagine
what happened in here.
This is the master bedroom,
largest room we have.
So, Arthur and
Eleanor slept in here?
Yes.
Can I ask you a
personal question?
Of course.
Do you think Arthur did it?
What's in here?
Uh, that is old storage.
Truthfully, I haven't
been in there in years.
I don't even have a
key for it anymore.
This is Patrick's bedroom.
Sadly, they never
found Patrick's body.
Suffered a broken arm
in the car accident
that killed Margaret.
Apparently, he was very
traumatized by her death.
They were driving
home from the city,
hit by a truckload
of town drunks.
I can't even imagine.
Our offices are 15 minutes
away, so don't hesitate to call.
We can usually get
here pretty quick.
Thank you very much.
Are you familiar with the
Abaddon Hotel a town over?
Yeah.
It burned to the
ground a few years ago.
Well, yes, it's an
empty field now,
but there is an antique store
that recovered quite
a few of the items.
Given the work
that you're doing,
I thought that
might interest you.
Ooh, definitely interested
in the antique store.
Call if you need anything.
Thanks again.
Well?
Seems nice.
I mean, my company
would definitely buy it
if it weren't so huge.
What?
So, Chase is gonna
be here in an hour.
Okay, yeah, no, don't
gimme that, please.
I think it's gonna be great.
He's gonna be an extra hand.
Margot, he's not an
extra set of hands.
He's a liability.
Listen, I'm sorry,
okay? I'm sorry.
I love him, too, but he is.
I know.
But I think he's got
his shit together,
and just give him
a chance, okay?
Margot...
Can I shut this thing off now?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna lie,
this is not... not as bad
as I thought it would be.
I told you so.
Margot.
Oh. Hey.
You got it open?
Are we even allowed
to be in there, or...?
Okay.
What is all this?
I don't know.
Well, I could see why
they would keep it locked.
We should do the same.
Hello? Margot?
Hey, he's here.
Hey. Where are you guys?
Chase?
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
- I missed you.
- I missed you!
You started already, huh?
- Yeah.
- This is how it's done?
This is how it's done.
- Wow.
- Oh, my God. Hi.
Your face. How are
you? Good? Yeah?
You seeing someone?
You got here safe?
Everything good with that?
- Here we go.
I'm fine, all right?
And I am seeing somebody.
Hey, Scorsese.
How are you doing?
Hey, Chase. How you doing?
Did you just say
you're seeing somebody.
She's making you film
every conversation?
- Yep. Pretty much.
- Wow.
Oh, I'm still here. What,
y-you're seeing somebody?
I'm sure this is gonna make
for some great TV someday.
Don't... Don't
walk away from me.
Are you getting
married tomorrow?
What's... What's her name?
Is she... Is she beautiful?
Cut it out!
When you look back
at Margot's history,
you can see where she
grew her own passion
for solving cold cases.
I mean, what happened to her
at a county fair as a child,
that would leave
a mark on anyone.
When Margot was about 10,
her family took her and
Chase to the county fair.
She got separated
from them somehow,
and a man she didn't know
tried to lure her away
from the fairgrounds.
It took her a little while to
realize something was wrong,
and she started to scream.
The guy ran off.
She couldn't help her parents
or the police identify him.
I think, as she got older,
it really must have sunk in
that she could
have died that day,
because several others went
missing from that same fair,
and they were never seen
again over the years.
I think, in some ways, she
felt partially responsible.
In college, she and I
envisioned the website
that would become Net Sleuths.
And, over the years,
we developed it into a
pretty significant community
of Internet detectives focused
on solving the unsolved.
Margot always had to take
things a step further.
She began this routine
of staying in the places
where she was investigating,
taking a ton of
photos and video.
Her last investigation ended
up being the Carmichael Manor.
It's alleged that, on
October 10th, 1989,
Arthur killed his
wife, daughter, and son
during the night, just
brutally stabbing them.
And then, he leaves
the manor with Patrick,
dumping his body in
some unknown location.
And then, Arthur just
completely disappears.
What makes him the main suspect?
Because there was
no forced entry.
And there was also
early snow that year,
so it was very easy for the
police to see a single set
of footprints leaving the
house and going into the woods.
What about Patrick?
So, his body was never found,
but there was blood
all over his bed,
so the police think that he may
have been Arthur's first victim,
killing him first,
then Catherine, and then
Eleanor, stabbing them.
Oh, my God.
And Catherine, she was
killed in our room?
Mm, can we switch with Chase?
Okay, so, theoretically,
Arthur Carmichael walks
down these stairs,
and he's covered in blood, and
wouldn't have time to change.
So... hold on, Chase. Move.
Okay.
He walks down this
way, to the left,
right outside these doors.
But no, he's gone.
Just vanishes. Not a
drop of blood anywhere.
Not even in the snow.
But, okay, what
about Patrick's body?
Was he carrying it? Or
how is that explained?
Oh, it's not.
What do you want from me?
I mean, I... don't
get me wrong,
I'm... I'm glad you called.
I'm just, I'm not
much of a... a sloth.
- No, Chase. No.
- What?
- It's... I'm sorry.
- It's sleuth.
I'm not much of a sleuth.
So, I need at least two
cameras filming at all times.
Thank you.
Even the most mundane stuff,
not even relating to
the investigation.
Margot thinks, of all the places
that we've been to that
are supposedly haunted,
this one's actually
for real this time.
Oh.
Shoot, I gotta get this.
Hi. Linda.
Can you... Can you hear me?
I...
Linda, can you...?
Aw, dammit.
All right, sleuthers, this
is our first official night
at the Carmichael Manor,
Manor, Manor, Manor.
And everyone seems
to be settling in.
How's it going?
Hey.
Sorry.
I'll... I'll be more
help in the morning.
Before we left, my job
sent all these listings
for me to sort before
my presentation.
But thank God the Internet
does work, though.
Hey, I totally get it.
New job, new responsibilities.
But hey, seriously,
I'm just very thankful
that you came with
me at all this time.
So, thank you.
Listen, about that.
You know I love going on
these adventures with you,
cracking old mysteries.
Truly, I... I love it.
I feel like there's
a "but" coming, here.
This is probably gonna
be one of the last times
I'm able to go with you...
at least for a little while.
I really like this job,
and I need it to stick.
And going to old
murder houses, I...
Can you turn that
thing off for a second?
Hey.
Hey.
Thank you for the big room.
This is... well, probably the
nicest room I've ever slept in.
I thought you'd have me
in the attic or something.
Oh, I... I haven't
ruled that out.
Where's your, uh, what...
what's it called again?
A... A camera?
- Tomorrow, I promise.
I won't ever put it down.
I will take it with
me to the bathroom.
Okay, okay.
I'm just saying.
Do you actually think
this place is haunted?
I don't know.
But if it is, please
get it on camera.
Yeah, but none of the
places that you've...
you've been to before
were actually haunted?
No.
So why call me now?
What do you want me
to say, here, Chase?
That... That...
That mom called,
and told you I had an incident,
and... and you thought that
this would be the best way
to keep an eye on me.
And what if that's true?
Is that so bad?
You get to help me. Now
I get to help you, too.
- I... I don't need help, Margot.
- Oh, you don't?
Because last I heard, you
went missing for two days,
and nobody knew where you went.
That's......
that's not what happened.
It's not.
What was that?
Rebecca?
Hey.
- Jesus.
What's going on?
- Did you hear it?
- I don't know.
What did you hear?
- It-it-it sounded like...
Like what?
It sounded like someone
was singing downstairs,
- Singing?
- Like a girl was singing.
Hey. Where... Where
are you going?
Did you get it on camera?
Um, I don't think I recorded
in time, but at least I tried.
Hey.
- Yeah?
Thanks for using the camera.
You got it.
Okay.
Hey, sleuthers.
Sorry, I can't take
that seriously.
Okay, so, last night
was the last night
I'm staying on these sheets.
I got some new ones yesterday.
The old ones had, like,
a weird odor to them.
And Margot, since you want
me to film everything,
you're gonna get all of this.
We have not yet
invented a better way
of figuring out which
corner goes where.
She is conveniently absent
when I have to make the bed.
All right.
There you go, Margot.
See that? It wasn't so hard.
Nice and clean.
You can thank me later.
Figure, if this is gonna be
our last adventure together,
may as well have
fresh sheets, right?
Mwah.
Love you.
Like, I slept like a baby,
though, right through the night.
What time was it?
Good morning, my little sleuths.
- Hey.
- Good morning.
Do you wanna go to that
antique store today?
You know, we could get lucky
with some really good clues.
And then, on the way, you know,
we might find the
perfect wooden bench...
For the foot of our
bed! There it is.
What should I do?
Oh, you should definitely
just stay here.
Please film.
- That's it?
You don't need me
to do anything?
No. That's it.
I guess I will hang out here,
and, uh, let you know
if I see any ghosts.
Thank you.
Oh, hey, you might get lucky.
You might get
breakfast and a show,
because, according to
Rebecca, they love to sing.
- Mm. No.
I said it sounded like singing.
I didn't say it was
actually singing.
Hey.
Thought we were leaving.
God, what is all this?
Yep.
Giving creepy carny vibes.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
We should get on the road.
- Chase?
- Hey.
Hey.
This place is incredible.
I feel like I'm on vacation.
So, Rebecca and I were
gonna go antiquing.
I just wanna make
sure you're all good,
that you're gonna
be good by yourself.
I'm fine.
I... I will keep an eye on
the place for you, all right?
What?
- Where's your camera?
It's right there.
And we're here for five days,
so please don't be shy
with the camera, okay?
All right.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
All right. See you
in a few hours.
- Have fun.
- Thank you.
Oh, you wanted footage, Margot,
you're gonna get some footage.
Boo!
Margot, my dear, I've
solved your murders.
Turns out there were
no murders at all.
The Carmichaels
are alive and well.
They faked their own death
as a tax evasion scheme.
Ooh!
It's me, Arthur Carmichael.
You brought this upon
yourself, Margot.
You are gonna get a
day in the life of...
Margot?
Rebecca?
Are you guys...
Are you guys home?
Margot?
Margot.
Come on, you guys better
not be fucking with me.
Rebecca.
Come on.
Hello?
Say something.
Hello?
All right, all right, all right.
All right, motherfucker.
Oh, come on.
- Wow.
- So cute.
Those are very cute.
- Oh, my god.
- What?
The perfect wooden bench
for the end of our bed.
Oh! There it is.
- It's a little small, but...
- A little small.
- Margot.
- What?
- Oh, look at this.
- Yeah. Wow.
- You from outta town?
- Oh!
God. Yes. Sorry.
Yes. No.
Yeah, we're in
town for the week.
Um, what's... what's
all this, here?
Those are all the things
found at the Abaddon Hotel
before it burned to the ground.
I often wonder if anything
would've turned out differently
if Margot and Rebecca
hadn't wandered into
that antique shop.
They find all this junk
from the Abaddon Hotel.
Nothing that big of a deal.
And then, Rebecca
notices something
about that clock, and
everything changes.
- It has compartments.
- What?
It has compartments. It
has secret compartments.
How do you know that?
That's an old
German manufacturer.
One of the listings has
the same clock that I have.
Built all the
clocks the same way.
Why are you whispering?
It's secret.
Okay.
Holy shit.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
Okay, keep going. Keep going.
Okay. Yep.
Oh. We can't take that!
Yes, we can.
Look at this.
"All staff must be present
Thursday, September 15th.
Hotel will be closed.
He wants Beverly found, and
safely brought back to hotel,
of fear she might be pregnant"?
"Please handle with caution."
Who the fuck is Beverly?
What?
Okay, yep. We're
taking all of it.
Oh. We can't take everything.
Yes, we can. Nobody
knows it exists.
Hey, you guys back?
Margot?
Hey, guys, are you here?
And of course, the
fucking power's out.
Hello?
Fuck.
The fuck is that?
Oh, shit. What the fuck?
Oh.
Hello?
Who is that?
The fuck?
Oh.
Fuck.
Fucking shit.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Oh, shit.
Fuck.
Hey! Who is that?
Say something.
Fucking shit.
Here we go.
Who's in here?
Hey, we're back.
You okay?
Did the power go out?
Yeah, um...
yeah, I, um...
sorry.
Um, can... can I
talk to you guys?
Yeah.
Boom. Right there.
Oh, my God. You
can see a face.
Are you sure you were alone?
Who else would be here?
I mean, down here and upstairs?
You might be right
about this place.
It might actually be real.
- I mean, I...
- Don't.
Don't say "I told you so."
I've always had my suspicions
that there was something more
behind her going to
the Carmichael Manor...
like she was after a bigger
piece to a bigger puzzle,
which had eluded
people for years.
But she definitely found it.
The film canister
that they found
inside that old clock
from the Abaddon,
that something so
game-changing was in there
the whole time, while
"Hell House" was there,
"Insomnia," and... and
everyone else, just...
just waiting for someone
to open it, and find it.
Over 30 years
later, somebody did.
I thought I would
see some footage
of the Abaddon early days,
since the footage was
found inside the hotel.
But when I processed it,
that isn't what I saw at all.
What did you see?
The Carmichaels.
Hello.
Margaret?
Pat? Are you guys still here?
Hello?
You are an asshole, Pat.
You guys scared
the shit outta me.
Hey, don't get mad at me.
It was all Margaret's
idea, okay?
My idea?
You're the one who said we
needed to add some drama
to Catherine's movies.
These aren't supposed to
be manufactured drama.
It's like cinema verite.
That's the whole
point of the project.
You're lucky.
Pat wanted me to
hide in your closet.
That would've been awesome.
C'mon, we gotta go.
We gotta avoid the
bridge traffic.
Where are you guys going?
My first rehearsals
in the city today.
We're doing "Faust"
in three weeks.
Pat's gracious enough
to gimme a lift.
Well, can I come with you guys?
I mean, that would make
for some great footage.
Mom said you have to stay here.
Don't worry. We'll be
home before dinner.
Get one last shot of me
before I go shine on stage.
Sadly, that was the last
image ever taken of Margaret.
She was killed
later that evening.
And Patrick was
never the same again.
There really is no
obvious motive here,
and that is the most
frustrating part.
Find anything interesting
at the antique shop?
About the Carmichaels?
Sadly, no.
But we found a lot of weird
shit about the Abaddon Hotel.
So, listen to this.
"Something's coming.
Cold, the nightfall.
All things die and
never come back."
Well, that, that sounds
like a fun nursery rhyme.
It's like a bunch of notes
that were meant to be burned,
but instead someone put
them inside of a clock.
Okay, wait, there's one
more that I wanna read.
This one, this one, this one.
"When they return,
the most common side effect
is bleeding from the face.
Doc says some form of he-
mm, haemo-haemolacria?
Can you Google
that or something?
Return from where?
I don't know.
Hey, what's this?
I found that in the
Abaddon clock, too.
Might keep it in my room.
I could use some good luck.
- Shit, Chase.
There is a light on the camera.
Just hit that button
on the left side.
All right, hang on, hang on.
- Come on. Not that hard.
- There's a lot of buttons.
Hang on.
There we go.
- Good job.
All right, where
are the breakers?
Do you know?
Yes, they should be, follow me,
closet near the front.
As if this place can
get any creepier.
I know, right?
It's gonna be fine. Stop.
Uh.
- Oh.
- Oh, fuck.
Well, I guess we don't
need the breakers.
- You got it.
- God,
I was not about to stay
here without any power.
Yeah, sorry about that.
Donald said that might hap...
What?
Margot, what?
What the...
Is that from the chest
that was upstairs.
Shit, Margot.
I'm telling you,
something's not right here.
Where are you, by the way?
Margot?
Oh, hey.
Have you seen Margot?
Yeah, she's outside, um,
hey, could I talk
to you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Like you, you put
on fresh sheets.
Yeah. The the other
ones had like an odor-
Right, like a, like a,
like an old sweater.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, yeah, mine too.
Uh, but, what's up?
Is, is this a
camera-friendly conversation?
Oh, yeah.
Keep filming. I, I don't care.
Um, I, I just
wanted to, you know,
gauge your comfort level
with, with all this.
Comfort level?
You know, Margot,
she, she, she goes
on these crusades
and, and she doesn't
know how to stop.
I mean, she can be
a little obsessive
and, and I'm sure that's part
of the reasons you love her.
But...?
Right, I just, I
just wanna make sure
that we don't stay any longer
than we have to, you know?
So like, if, if, if at any point
this gets to be too much for you
and you want to leave, just know
that, that I totally
have your back, okay?
Yeah. Thanks, Chase.
I, I think I'm okay for now.
As long as I have internet.
Right.
Wait, well, good, good luck
with, with your call now.
Oh!
Oh yeah. Thanks.
In all the decades of rumors
and stories surrounding
the Carmichael Manor,
you could tell just after
watching the first day
of Margot's footage that
they were all probably true,
but they weren't really
phased at all by any of this.
Oddly enough, it was Chase
who first started urging
a little more caution,
suggesting that maybe
they don't have to stay
the full five days,
but then it got worse.
Hey.
Hey, Rebecca, how have you been?
Hey. Hey, Linda.
How's it going?
Okay. There you go.
Hi. Sorry about
the poor service.
I am out in the
country with Margot.
But I should still be able
to share my presentation.
Fingers crossed.
I love spending
time in the country.
How is it there?
It is different.
That's what makes it great.
All these listings are
old Colonial style,
which is perfect
for us to take on
because they need a lot of work.
Um, here, let me get
a screen share going
and I will show you
the listing pictures.
Oh, wow.
Right?
What was that?
Sorry, I don't know
how that got there.
I love this listing.
What's the ask on
this one again?
This one is 230,000.
Excellent.
Good find, Rebecca.
Thanks.
Here, let me show
you this next one.
I know you're gonna love it too.
Um...
Whoa.
I think it's nice,
but that foyer doesn't
really scream fixer upper.
Wait, I'm sorry.
This, this, this isn't right.
Beautiful staircase.
Is this the wrong file?
This isn't the file.
I, I didn't take these.
Everything okay, Rebecca?
Who is that?
Is that, is that you?
Honey, are you okay?
Do you need to take a
break to sort this out?
So theoretically, Linda
has it recorded, yeah?
Margot, I don't care
if they recorded it.
I never wanna see that again.
Do you not get that?
- Yes.
I know you are upset.
That is clear.
- No shit I'm upset.
I know. So it doesn't matter.
I need to see it.
Margot, I don't care
if you wanna see it.
I, I probably lost my job today.
Well, wait, what, what happened?
Rebecca said that she
saw something weird
on her video conference,
like a person.
In this room, in a
picture with me in it.
- Shit, are you okay?
- She's fine.
I'm not fucking fine, Margot.
You, you didn't see it. I...
I knew I shouldn't
have come this time.
Okay, so now it's my fault.
Margot, I may have
lost the only job
getting us any income.
You-Listen, I love that you
hunt these old ghost stories,
but i-it's just a hobby.
It doesn't pay the bills,
it does nothing for us.
You and me. Okay?
It just satisfies some
obscure obsession you have.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm getting out of here,
okay? We all should.
Congrats, this place
is the real deal.
Now let's get the
hell out of here.
Okay so where you're losing me
is you mock all these
places that we go to
because "Oh, they
might be haunted,"
but then when a place actually
might be you want to leave?
Yeah.
And I'm sure that I'm not the
only one that feels that way.
Chase?
I, I, I'm, I- I
agree with Rebecca.
I mean, you know,
I don't think we should
stay longer than we have to.
There you go.
Thank you.
Okay. Okay.
Can you just turn that off
and give me and
Rebecca time to talk?
Yeah.
Hey, Becs. How are
you holding up?
I appreciate your
dedication to the camera.
Hey, if we're gonna
stay one more night,
might as well give
Margot a full card.
Plus, I'm afraid she might
yell at me if I put it down.
One more night, then, then
we leave in the morning.
Hey, you're not gonna
get any pushback from me.
What's she up to now?
Oh, you know,
just retracing the exact steps
of the killer and victims.
For what? Like the
thousandth time?
So, do you still have a job?
The internet hasn't worked
since my presentation,
so who knows.
Hey, you're gonna be all right.
I can't make this make sense.
What?
It's an old photo from
the Abaddon clock.
Yeah, the pictures
of the Abaddon Hotel,
those make sense.
But this?
- And is that?
- Yes.
What the fuck?
I know. And look at the back.
Clarksburg Fair,
West Virginia, 1975.
Do you see that carnival
game in the back?
That is the exact game
that is currently upstairs
at this very mansion
with the same two clown costumes
on those two mannequins.
- Three mannequins.
- What?
There's three
mannequins upstairs.
I, what does it all mean?
I mean, like, there it is.
There what is?
We officially have
a direct connection
between this house
and the Abaddon Hotel.
Explain to me how this
game gets from Clarksburg
to the middle of
nowhere, Rockland County.
And then this photo gets
in the Abaddon Hotel clock?
Maybe, um, maybe we
should leave tonight.
No! We are just actually-
What the fuck was that?
The, th-th-the call button.
Someone's upstairs c-
calling down to the kitchen.
Holy sh-Margot.
Right, how, how, how
do we know what
room's coming from?
It's, it's, it's in
there above the door.
All right, all right. Hang on.
Go.
It, it says Patrick.
Okay. Okay.
Come with me. Let's go.
- All right, all right,
all right.
- You, you guys
are going up there?
Yes. And stay here. Stay here.
Use the camera.
Go.
Shh.
Looks like the light's
on in the room.
- Was that on before?
- I don't know.
Hello?
Hello.
Hang on.
Jesus.
- Watch it!
- Holy shit.
- Fuck.
Jesus. How the did that
get in here, Margot?
I don't...
Oh, shit.
It's fucking staring at us.
- I know, I know.
All right, hang on.
- Okay.
- Hang on.
Fuck.
Touch it.
- Fuck. Shh.
Fuck.
Okay.
See, just a mannequin.
Fucking clowns, Margot.
You had to pick somewhere
with clowns.
- Dude, shut up. It's fine.
Okay, well.
Guys? Anyone up there?
Hello?
Who's there?
What's wrong? What happened?
In t-t-the, in the
closet. In the closet.
- Go!
- All right. All right.
Fuck. Fucking clowns.
Can we go? Can we go?
Can we go, now?
- Jesus.
What did mom tell you
about what happened to me?
Do you wanna talk about it?
I saw this little
girl all alone,
and then she said that
she couldn't find her mom,
so I wanted to help her.
- Good. That's-
- No, not good.
- Why not?
- Because,
because, she wasn't real.
She kept, she kept disappearing
and then, and appearing
wherever I was that day.
She said that her and her
mom were staying at a hotel
and that she couldn't
find her mom.
I wanted to help her, but
she kept disappearing.
And then I realized that,
well, she's not real.
She must be in my head.
That's okay, Chase.
That's, that's why we want
you to stay on the medication-
But I was.
And it shouldn't have happened.
But she was so real to me.
And the last thing
that she said,
it never stuck out to
me until being here,
she said, "Go with Margot."
Then the next day you called me
and asked me to
come with you here.
- Um...
- No. No
Don't try to bullshit me.
This place is fucked. All right?
Something is, is
messing with us.
It probably doesn't want us
here, so let's not disappoint.
Okay?
Tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Tomorrow.
Hey, you gonna be
okay all by yourself?
Do you wanna bunk
with me and Becs?
No. I am gonna drink.
All right? That
will help the sleep.
Okay.
Um,
you know I love you, right?
I love you too.
Good.
Good night.
- Night.
Rebecca.
Rebecca.
What?
Did you hear that?
I thought I heard like a shout
and a thud right
outside our room.
Hold this.
What is it?
We're okay?
- Yeah.
I think so.
What's wrong?
Is, is that Chase's?
Chase? Chase?
Shit.
Where the hell are you?
He's not downstairs or outside.
Um, can can you call
his phone again?
Um, hey, it's in here.
What do you think?
I, I don't, I don't know.
I guess I got, I-I got a
text from him last night
saying, "Was that you?"
"Was that you," what?
I don't know. You were
sleeping, so I didn't respond.
Um, he, he probably heard
the same thing I did
when I woke up, right?
Rebecca?
What we know now
is that Chase didn't wander off.
Of course he didn't.
Hard to understand.
Even harder to watch
if you, you've seen the video.
And I have.
Well, Margot,
ya really picked a
winner with this place.
Let's just hope that we
all live to tell the tale.
Margot?
Margot?
All right. I think that's
enough for tonight.
Someone keeps
knocking on the door,
but there's nobody there.
There it is again, somebody
is outside my fucking door.
Fuck this.
Nothing.
Hello?
Hello.
Fuck.
All right, Margot,
as soon as the sun comes
up, we are outta here.
I love you. But, but this
place is absolutely fucked.
I just heard my door open.
Fuck. Something
just opened my door.
Oh fuck! What the f-
Oh my God.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Oh, fuck.
What the fuck.
Oh shit.
Okay. I'm, I'm gonna,
I'm, I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my bag.
Let me get my bag.
And, and, and, and, and,
and, and I'll leave.
And, and it'll be like, like,
like we were never here.
Okay?
And I'm sorry. All right?
I'm sorry.
Look, we're gonna go.
What the fuck?
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm so sorry. We're so sorry.
We're gonna go. Okay?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
I'm, I'm, uh, I'm going.
We're going.
Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
Oh please, please, please,
please, please, please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh please, please, please,
please, please, please.
No!
Come on. I'm going.
I'm going.
Okay, okay.
Pat, are you okay?
Can I do anything for you?
What is all this?
Hey, are you okay?
Why are you filming me?
I told you I don't wanna be
part of your fucking movies.
Oh, Jesus.
Pat, is that Margaret's dress?
Why would you...
What if someone told you
they could bring her back?
I, who told you that?
Patrick, she's dead.
I'm sorry.
I miss her too, but this,
this isn't right.
Don't look in there.
Please leave.
I want you to have something.
I don't expect you
to wear this, but,
just keep it on you, okay?
It helped me when I needed it.
For some reason, the
people my brother works for
asked him to store
their junk in our house.
And I went through
a trunk of theirs.
What was inside?
Well, a lot of things,
but I found this.
It's sheet music.
So let's see.
♪ Somethings coming
♪ Cold the nightfall
♪ All things die
♪ And never come back
♪ Throw the ashes
♪ Grasp your crosses
♪ Pray to him
♪ You'll never come back
♪ Life's a circle
♪ Full of darkness
♪ Stay with him
♪ And never come back
Jesus. Pat, where do you work?
Where'd you go, Chase?
Come on.
Hey, Margot.
Margot, it's time to go.
What?
No, we are not leaving
here without my brother.
What?!
- And what if
something happened to him?
What are we gonna do?
Just wait for something
to happen to us?
No it's, you know my brother.
He's gonna be fine.
He probably just had another
episode and he's coming back.
Right, right.
He just wandered off again
with his bag in the
middle of the hallway
without his phone.
Are you serious right now?
- Let's at least give him
some more time while
the the sun is up.
Doesn't that make more sense?
- Margot!
I don't wanna wait
here another second.
Please don't make me.
- Can we just give him
more time and we will
leave before it's dark?
I promise.
Please.
Fine, okay? Fine.
Two o'clock. Okay?
And that's it. That's it.
I am driving out of here
with or without Chase.
Or you.
Very little is known about
Andrew Tully's early days,
but we've been able to
figure out a few details.
Tully was once a
deeply-religious man
with a family living in
Arkansas in the 1960s.
He had a younger daughter
who died tragically,
Abigail Tully.
And from there it
becomes a little hazy
because he fled
an arrest warrant.
That much we know,
it's on record.
On the run in your home
state, what do you do?
Where do you go?
Tully goes to Clarksburg,
West Virginia,
meets two men named Thomas
Rollins and Freddy Perkins.
What we know about Thomas
Rollins and Freddy Perkins
before they moved to
Abaddon, New York,
is that they ran a gaming
stand, Down-A-Clown,
just the two of them,
throughout the late
'60s and early '70s.
But in Catherine's footage,
there's a third clown suit.
Who does that belong to?
There is a case to be made
that the cult
started right there
at a small-town fair
in West Virginia,
where Tully would meet with
his closest confidants.
And they followed him
to Abaddon, New York,
where they built their
cover story hotel
and hired a bunch of
locals to work there.
Locals like Patrick Carmichael.
Margot, now it's four o'clock.
Okay? We, we gave
him two extra hours.
He's not here. It's time to go.
Okay? Let's go to the car.
No. Oh...
Fuck, okay, yeah.
I'm sorry, Chase. I'm sorry.
Once we get into town,
we'll go straight
to the police, okay?
They'll find him, Margot.
Okay. They, they're
good at that stuff.
Right now, we have
to look after ours...
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What's wrong?
I don't know. I'm, I'm
not a goddamn mechanic.
I don't...
Fuck- - Rebecca.
Rebecca, Jesus.
Okay. Um- - I knew I shouldn't
have come here.
I knew I shouldn't
have fucking come here.
It's okay, okay,
listen. Listen.
It's 4 o'clock.
If we leave right now on foot,
we will make it to the main
road before the sun goes down.
That's 12 miles through
woods and back roads.
We'll never make it.
- I-I know we'll make it,
um, unless you want to stay.
We wait till tomorrow.
Donald comes back and
we just stay the night.
Oh, fuck.
Okay, if we go
right now on foot,
we walk a mile, what,
every 15, 20 minutes?
We can make it back
before it is dark.
Come on. We gotta go now.
Okay, let, let's do it.
Let, let's walk.
The Carmichael Woods is acres
and acres of private woods.
And that's even before
you get to the miles
of back roads and small paths.
So sure, they probably
could have made it
to town before nightfall,
but that was going
to be a challenge.
And that was before
they saw what they saw.
Anything?
Still nothing.
Careful.
Careful, careful.
- Fuck.
Careful.
I'm okay.
So we've been walking
for about an hour
and we're making good time.
And I think, I think
we're gonna make it
before the sun's down.
God, I hope so.
And yeah. So that's
all I got for you.
I guess tomorrow
we're gonna get a tow
and keep looking for Chase.
Do you see anything?
Nothing.
Anything?
Let's just keep going.
Fuck.
Did you hear that?
Was that like a bird?
The hell was that?
Oh shit. Let's run.
No, we can't run.
Just, just walk
fast. Walk fast, go.
We can't run nine miles.
Go.
Why?
Why on God's earth is
there a hearse out here?
Oh my God.
Come on. Let's keep going.
What?
What is that?
Oh my God.
Yeah, okay.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
Holy shit, holy shit. Holy shit.
Go!
I can't, I can't run anymore.
Yes, you can give me your hand.
We are not staying out here
with whatever the fuck that was.
Go!
- Okay.
Come on.
- I see it.
- Go.
- I see it.
- Thank God. Thank God.
Go.
Go, go. Go.
Do you have to film
right now? Just stop.
If there was ever
a time to make sure
that we were filming everything,
it is literally right now.
Margot, I just wanna
get out of here.
Okay. I don't care about
your stupid murders.
I never did- -
There's a reason
that this is happening.
Everything that we've seen,
those things in the woods,
it means that we're getting
closer to the truth.
Who cares if we find out
who fucking killed
Kennedy in this house?
None of it matters
if we're dead.
Well, I'm fucking sorry
that I ever brought
you here, okay?
I didn't think I was taking
you against your will,
I thought you
actually wanted to.
Sorry!
Okay?
Fuck.
You have service?
It's a text from Chase.
It's a text from Chase.
Okay. Well, what does it say?
It just says, "Hi."
That doesn't make any sense.
Why? Where's this phone?
I-I left it in his room.
H-how is that possible?
I don't know.
G-good. Maybe he's
back in his room.
No don't, don't, don't go.
Just, just text him back.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Um, um.
Hey, where have you been?
"Met some new friends."
What does that mean?
I don't know.
Who are your friends?
"They wanna meet you."
What is he talking about?
What friends? Who are they?
Why don't you come to our room?
But, no. What if
that's not him.
That's what I'm
trying to find out.
"They won't like that."
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Margot, I have to leave here.
I cannot stay here.
"Okay, I'll come."
- I'm leaving.
- To where?
Just, Rebecca, stop. Just wait.
Please wait.
Who is that?
Hello?
Chase?
Chase, is that you?
What are you doing?
Don't stop filming.
I love you.
Don't go, please, don't.
Please.
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Oh, god.
Hello?
W-what does it say?
What?
It, it says
"They're in your room now."
Stop. It's okay.
I don't wanna stay
here. No fucking way.
Rebecca, stop.
Rebecca, stop.
Come back.
It's okay. Calm down.
Calm down, Rebecca. Calm down.
Don't tell me to
fucking calm down!
Fuck.
Pat, We, we thought
you were dead.
No, I was in jail.
You arm? How did you?
Won't need that any more.
Pat?
Pat!?
What happened at that hotel?
They're saying it
was a mass suicide.
Were you there?
No. I told you, I was in jail.
Got into a fight.
Do you know what happened?
The hotel you worked
at, they're all dead.
They didn't die. They
just crossed over.
I was supposed to be there.
Crossed over?
What do you mean, crossed over?
Are you listening to yourself?
You shouldn't be filming me.
Turn the camera off.
Catherine.
What we know about the mass
suicide at the Abaddon Hotel
is that in the weeks
leading up to it,
very strange and
unexplainable events
were happening all
around the area.
Almost like whatever they
were doing in that basement
was releasing some
sort of dark energy.
Turns out the Carmichael
Manor was no exception.
You can tell that
something about Patrick
was different that night.
Catherine confronts Patrick
about the suicides
at the Abaddon,
and that was the last
night of her life.
Whatever came for them that
night was able to do so
without leaving a single
track in the snow.
Not a trace.
It's okay.
They're in the house.
They're in the house.
Catherine.
What the hell?
Start. Please start, please.
Please!
Oh, no, no, no.
Hello? Hello?
Fuck, why won't you work?
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay.
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay.
I need it to be like
that. I really...
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Margot!
W-w-what was that?
Margot, please.
Wait, Margot. Margot.
Something's not right. I
don't think that's Chase.
It's him. It's him.
I know it's him.
Margot, I'm asking you,
please, that's not him.
Don't go.
Just stay here
and lock the door.
Margot.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
It's working. It's working.
Hi, my name is Rebecca Vickers.
We're at Carmichael Manor
at 101 Starlight Drive,
please, something's
in the house with us.
Margot! That's not him!
Fuck!
Hello? Hello?
Shit.
Margot!
Hey, Chase.
Hey, hey Chase.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Fuck. Fuck, Chase.
Chase, no.
Rebecca!
Rebecca, Chase is hurt.
Chase is hurt.
Rebecca, we need to get help.
Rebecca. No, no, no, no.
Rebecca! Rebecca!
Open the door!
Please, please.
Chase is hurt.
Please, we have to-
No, no!
I know what you did.
I was there.
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Please stop, please
stop, please stop.
No, no.
No, please. Please, no!
Please, please, please, please.
Please stop.
Please stop, no please.
Please. No, no, no, no.
No. No, no, please.
I don't,
please.
It's not over.
Evil never dies.
No fire will ever destroy it.
You can never claim
victory over it.
That evil will always exist
and it will always be there.
Sometimes in plain sight.
If anyone finds this recording,
I had no choice.
We all serve him
in different ways.
Stop talking!
It'll be over soon.
Did you guys hear
that Rockland County's
starting the fair up again?
No way.
