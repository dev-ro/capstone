Ooh-ooh.
Is that...?
- Oh, my God! What even is that?
- These are my moves.
- Stop, that's embarrassing.
- It's not embarrassing.
Wait, I was gonna interview you.
You were? What were you
gonna interview me about?
I don't know.
Well...
Well, I just turned 11.
And you are 130,
turning 131 in two days.
So...
when you were 11,
what did you think
you would be doing now?
I love you.
Love you.
Bye.
Hi everyone, my name is Belinda,
and I'll be your tour rep
for the next week or two.
Now, I've only just transferred
in from Torremoli...
From Torremolinos!
Right, well, I...
I hope to be of help to you in Turkey.
We've got seven stops...
My name's Belinda.
And I've just come in from...
Torremolinos!
To... rre... mo... li... nos!
Torremolinos...
Hang tight, poppet, okay?
Okay.
I'm fine.
Someone's coming.
Time for bed?
No.
Hello?
It's 501.
Yep, that's us.
Yeah, I booked a room with two beds,
but we've only got one.
I paid for it
and it was confirmed by the travel agency.
That's all you can do?
Scooch under, there we go.
It will have to be, then.
Okay, thanks.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Digital video entertainment.
Don't get that wet, Soph.
It was expensive.
Sorry about the hotel.
Clive had a great time here.
Is everything okay at home?
What do you mean?
I mean, how are you
and your mum getting along?
Yeah, okay, I guess.
Good.
I'm glad.
Why? What did she tell you?
She didn't say anything.
You just told me you weren't getting along
last time I saw you.
I can't ask you
when I phone you at home.
Yeah, right.
Things have been better.
Why don't you go over
and introduce yourself?
Dad, no. They're, like, kids.
Uh-huh.
Why don't you go over
and introduce yourself?
Sophie, they're, like, old.
If you let it rest on an object
a bit, it gets the lighting right.
That's quite clever.
- You want a massive ice cream?
- Yeah, that's bigger than my head.
That's impossible,
you have a massive head.
- Are you done?
- What?
- That's a bit rude.
- No, it's not, it's just a fact.
Your head's bigger than mine.
I... I would disagree with that fact.
Look at the size of it.
Your head's bigger.
Say hello to your mum.
That's all?
- Love you.
- Say you miss her.
I miss you!
And what?
And bye-bye.
And what?
And my dad's being amazing.
- Why's your dad being amazing?
- Because he's so...
Uh-huh, what did she say?
I'll do it when I'm home.
School doesn't start until Tuesday.
Okay.
Yeah, it's good.
We're not actually at our hotel.
But ours doesn't have a phone.
Dad?
He's good.
Oh, my God, he's doing
weird slow-motion ninja moves.
Why is he so weird sometimes?
But, yeah, he's good.
All right. Love you, bye.
Mum wants to talk to you.
- What?
- Mum wants to talk to you.
All right.
Thanks, poppet.
Hey.
Checking up on me?
So, are you gonna do anything?
What do you mean?
With George.
He told Seb he wanted to...
with you, I mean.
Not Seb, obviously.
Last night, on the way home,
I gave Kenny...
Literally in the bushes
behind the other pool.
And what happened?
What do you mean?
Did he come?
Yeah... I mean, obviously.
You should wear your hair back sometimes.
You're really pretty with you hair back.
- Do you think she heard us?
- Who cares? She's like 9.
That's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you.
All right. Love you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, will do.
Bye.
Hey.
You know how to play?
- It's that one to start.
- I know.
Start your engine.
- Wanna play again?
- We're up.
- Bye.
- Bye.
There you go.
Are you ready?
Right. There you go.
- You don't mind?
- No bother.
Last one for now then.
You want a game of doubles?
Yeah, sure.
You've got a built-in rest there.
No danger. I'm right-handed
and I'm playing with a kid.
Go easy.
- Do you wanna break or...?
- Yeah.
Good.
Well done.
- What's your sister's name?
- Sophie.
Nice.
I'm her dad though actually.
- Sorry, I just thought...
- That's okay.
- It's a nice hotel, eh?
- Yeah, it's all right.
We're at the one over the road,
basically a building site.
Olly!
Fucking hell, Sophie, impressive.
Don't say "fuck".
- Sorry, mate.
- That's okay.
Well done.
I'm up. You watching?
- That's it, move it!
- No!
You have to ruin it again for everybody,
as usual!
Twist.
No, keep your...
I'm not letting you off. Go again.
No, you're just pushing.
Look, you have to twist.
Like here.
Okay? Again.
Grab my wrists.
I get it.
The thin part lines up
to where the fingers connect.
- Are you looking?
- Uh-huh.
- And then you pull as hard as you can.
- Ouch!
This is serious, Sophie.
Look at me, it's important you get this.
Go.
No.
You're not twisting, you're pulling.
- Again. Grab my wrists.
- I can't twist.
The thin part
where the fingers connect.
Okay? And you pull as hard as you can.
This is serious, Sophie.
It's important you get this, okay?
So you can defend yourself.
So if anyone ever tries to attack you...
you can break free and get away.
What if someone tries to attack me
without grabbing my wrists?
I think it's nice
that we share the same sky.
What do you mean?
Well, like,
sometimes at playtime,
I look up to the sky,
and if I can see the sun,
I think about the fact
that we can both see the sun.
So, even though we're not actually
in the same place
and we're not actually together,
we kind of are in a way, you know?
Like, we're both underneath
the same sky, so...
we're kind of together.
Head under.
2...
3...
4...
4.5...
Stop!
Can we do that?
Huh?
You're too young, poppet.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The marvellous, wonderful,
amazing, one-armed.
Calum Aaron Patterson.
Getting ready to see
the evening entertainment.
And...
let's see.
Torremolinos!
Are you okay, Soph?
You've not mentioned Claire.
Um...
Remember she had a boyfriend
when we met?
Yup.
I was like, "Who's that on the phone?"
You were like, "A girl I like,
but she's already with someone."
Yeah, well,
they got back together.
I liked her.
Uh-huh. Me too.
So does that mean
you're not gonna open the café?
The café?
No, not anymore, but...
I got this new thing going with Keith.
What is it?
We're still
figuring it out exactly.
But we're thinking of renting a house
outside of London for work.
You'd have your own room
for when you come down.
Yes. Can I paint it yellow?
Yellow? Why yellow?
I like the idea.
But mum doesn't let me
paint my room yellow.
You're trying to get me into trouble!
Well, can I though?
We'll see.
Let's watch this.
Room number?
Soph, did you bring your wallet?
No?
Grab this.
Do not look at him.
On the count to three,
we throw it at the stage and run.
Go, run! Run, Sophie!
Did it hurt?
When you fell.
- When I broke my wrist?
- Uh-huh.
I don't know.
I don't really remember.
I didn't think it was broken,
I had never broken anything before.
I've never broken anything before.
How come you and mum say "love you"?
What?
Like, on the phone.
You're not together.
So, why would you say it?
Well...
think of all the people
you say it to, like...
your Nana, grandad,
uncle, aunties, right?
Yeah, but they're family.
Well, your mother is family.
I remember one time,
I asked mum if she'd phoned you.
And she said that you were engaged.
I don't know why,
but I thought that meant
that you two were getting married.
I don't know if I thought that
about just you or both of you, but...
Isn't that funny?
Well,
I didn't know what it meant,
I didn't know that it meant that you
were just on the phone to somebody else.
I was kind of excited.
About us getting married?
Yeah, I was really young though.
I don't know, like, seven?
How are you
getting on with the book?
Enjoying it?
Yeah, it's a bit hard
to understand though.
Stick with it.
I think you'll really like it.
What does "municipal" mean?
A proper dive, Soph.
I told you, I can't.
- You were diving last year.
- I wasn't.
Here.
- Pass me my mask.
- I did.
What?
- Come on, stop messing around.
- I'm not messing around.
You know I didn't see you throw it.
Throw what?
The mask.
I know it was expensive.
It's okay, darling.
It's fine.
I'm a little tired today, that's all.
Can you grab the camera?
It's in the bag.
Here. Put that on your foot,
then try again.
- On my foot?
- Yeah, it's gonna be much easier.
- Do you need help?
- Yeah, please. Thanks.
- Thank you.
- That's a trick of the trade.
It's not a bad trade.
No, not at all.
Is this what you do all year?
You're like my anneanne,
my mother's mum.
- Your grandma?
- Yeah.
She'd prefer that I had a proper job.
What is your shoe size?
10.
- 10.
- 44?
- 44.
- Yeah.
- I think these should fit.
- Yeah.
You know, I used to travel a lot.
One season somewhere,
the next somewhere else,
but now I'm here, back home.
- And do you miss it?
- Travelling?
Not as much as I was missing home,
to be honest.
And I'm going to have a baby soon.
Congratulations!
A few years ago I thought
I'd be at least 40 before all that, but...
I can't see myself at 40, to be honest.
Surprised I made it to 30.
My name is Sophie Lesley Patterson,
reporting live from...
I don't know the name of this boat.
But I just went and saw
the most amazing thing
in my whole entire life.
So,
we went, like, scuba diving thing.
And there was actually, like, a seahorse
and it wrapped around my...
like, whole finger.
Then, when I got out, there was a...
octopus!
And the instructor person,
I don't know.
Yeah, the instructor put
an octopus on my head.
A real-life octopus on my head.
Yeah, but right now...
Dad... I mean, Calum Aaron Patterson
is away on some
scuba diving thing, I think.
I can't remember.
But...
he doesn't actually have a diving license,
because he told a porky pie!
But, yeah,
he'll be fine.
He'll be fine, I'm sure.
But, yeah, bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
What's that?
What?
That's just another kind of smoking,
and smoking...
Smoking causes cancer,
puts tar in your lungs,
and makes your teeth all yellow
and causes your eyeballs to fall out.
We'll go somewhere else next time.
It's not that bad.
When was the last time you saw Nana?
Right...
Trouble.
Watch again, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay?
Right, that was a bad start.
- When are you back at school?
- Tuesday.
- Next week?
- Really soon.
I thought it was later.
- Who's your new teacher?
- Miss Mackel.
The one from Glasgow?
How do you know that?
What?
She's pretty.
She's the pretty one from Glasgow!
She stuck in my head.
Oh, my God, Dad, stop!
- Okay.
- Stop.
She supposed to be good?
We done a crossover
at the end of term.
She seems all right.
Insert coin.
You playing?
- My dad's gone to get money.
- Here, watch this.
10p.
Got another?
I'm Michael, by the way.
You better have been practising,
Michael.
Harsh.
What's your name?
Sophie.
Are you joking?
That's 1-1.
I didn't know we were keeping count.
Yes, you did.
You okay through there?
I don't know, I guess.
I just feel a bit down or something.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Don't you ever feel like
you've just done
a whole amazing day,
and then you come home
and feel tired and down, and...
feels like your bones don't work.
They're just tired
and everything is tired.
Like you're sinking.
I don't know, it's weird.
We're here to have a good time.
Ready?
Yup!
We'll go get a nice dinner
and get an early night, yeah?
Yes.
Let's go.
Come on.
Do you think this one's lovely?
It is, actually.
The man was telling me that
each of these carpets
tell a different story.
The symbolism,
the motifs,
they represent different things.
Oh...
- Teşekkür ederim.
- What?
- Teşekkür ederim.
- Teşekkür ederim.
"Tea sugar" ederim.
Teşekkür ederim.
- Teşekkür ederim.
- Oh!
You see?
How much is this one?
This one is 45 million Turkish lira.
- And what's that in pounds?
- 850 pounds.
Okay, thanks.
You're welcome.
You gonna play pool?
Why not introduce yourself
to those girls over there?
She can play pool with us, if she wants.
There's only three of us.
- We'll play doubles.
- She's young, isn't she?
Yeah, but she's better than him.
Can I go?
Go on, then.
An hour,
and then you come right back, okay?
Okay.
Take your time, girls.
What's that?
It's an all-inclusive thing,
so you can get as much as you want
of anything.
- That's it?
- It's the same thing.
Well, well, well,
look who it is.
This is how you do it, mate.
You don't wanna see that.
Corrupting the youth!
You don't wanna see that.
There you go.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Gross. They've been snaking
for a fucking age.
What?
What the fuck is snaking?
Why, what do you call it?
That? That's tonguing.
It's not, that's nipping.
Nipping!
Should we push them in?
Yeah.
You get him, I'll get her.
Push 'em, yeah?
I wanna go!
Okey-dokey.
This is our room.
And this is Dad's tiny winy bed.
This is my giant bed.
Em...
Wait. How do I zoom?
Let's see. Pass it here.
It's this button here, see?
Oh my God, I'm on TV!
How do I look?
Okey-dokey, give that back.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
What's that?
Oh, my God, what even is that?
These are my moves.
- Stop, that's embarrassing.
- It's not embarrassing.
Wait, I was gonna interview you.
You were? What were you
gonna interview me about?
I don't know.
Well...
Well,
I just turned 11.
And you are 130,
turning 131
in two days.
So...
when you were 11,
what did you think
you would be doing now?
Hello? What did you think
you would be doing now?
Come on, Soph, turn that off now, okay?
Okay, it's off.
Well, I can see a red light.
That's just
because it's still on.
It's not even on you anymore,
it's on me.
Dad...
Okay, it's not recording.
I'll just record it in my little...
mind camera.
Right.
Ready?
What did you do for your 11th birthday?
When I was 11,
nobody remembered it was my birthday.
And when I told my mum,
she was so angry,
she grabbed me by the ear
and made my dad drive me to the toy shop
and pick something to buy.
That's a bit... deep.
It's okay.
What did you pick?
I chose a toy phone.
It was red.
- Good choice.
- Thank you.
Want a sip?
- Nice?
- Yeah, it tasted amazing!
Think you'll ever
move back to Scotland?
No.
Why?
There's not enough sun.
Very funny.
It's all in the past for me,
that's all.
And there's this feeling,
once you leave
where you grew up, that...
you don't
totally belong there again.
Not really.
But Edinburgh was never...
I never felt
like I really did belong there.
I do. It's home.
That's good.
I'm glad you feel that way.
But you never know where you'll end up.
You can live wherever you want to live.
Be whoever you want to be.
You have time.
It's okay.
Top up time.
No, I'll do it.
How's that working?
Let me help.
No, Soph.
Scooch back.
Lift your hair a sec.
There you go.
Let's do something, eh?
Get this day going.
Like what?
Water polo?
I'm not a good enough swimmer.
You're a great swimmer, Soph, you know it.
Come on.
It's our last few days
and it will be fun.
Up.
Up! Up! Up! Up!
We're going swimming.
Hands up, hands up!
Soph! Soph!
Could I get another one?
Thank you.
What are you wearing your bikini for?
I don't know.
Are you excited for tomorrow?
Yeah.
Are we all having fun, guys?
- Yeah!
- Soph's having fun.
Let's get a round of applause
for Calum and Sophie!
You didn't sign us up?
I did! We've done it every holiday
since I was five.
You're a little old for it now.
What? Those girls were, like, 50.
Let it go, he'll move on in a second.
I'm not up for it.
Come on, they just want to hear us.
We should be having fun.
Sophie, I'm not doing it, okay?
Here we go.
Big applause for Sophie!
Down you come, please. Here you are.
We could get you singing lessons
if you wanted to learn.
Are you telling me I can't sing?
I'm just saying anyone can learn.
Stop doing that.
Doing what?
Offering to pay
when you don't have the money.
Come on.
Let's call it an early night.
No, I'm staying here for a bit.
See you upstairs, then.
Sophie?
Not too long.
Pass it down.
All right, Toby, calm down.
I promise, I have had one too many.
- You haven't...
- I have!
A couple more.
No, I'm being serious.
Do you want help finding your dad?
- Nah.
- All right.
Can I get some water, please?
Are you okay?
Hanging out.
Here.
Boys are disgusting.
Got it!
I'm going tomorrow anyway, so...
You're staying a few more days, right?
Yeah.
Now you can get whatever you want.
- Thanks.
- It's okay.
See you.
What do you want?
Can I get a Fanta lemon, please?
And I have this.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the marvellous, wonderful,
amazing, one-armed.
Calum Aaron Patterson.
Getting ready to see
the evening's entertainment.
And...
let's see.
Torremolinos!
Are you okay, Soph?
- Fuck, what did you do that for?
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, it was supposed to be a joke.
- Idiot!
Where are you going?
I should be going home, but got lost.
Everything looks the same at night.
Why don't you come and hang out with us?
- What are you doing?
- Michael!
Come on!
I didn't know
there was another pool back here.
Yeah, it's quiet in the day.
And I'm not a great swimmer,
so it suits me.
Same. I still can't dive.
So,
I quite like you.
Do you like me?
Yes.
Miss!
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Happy birthday, Sophie.
I'll get him.
Hello?
This is your wake up call, sir.
Okay, thanks.
The day trip leaves in 20 minutes.
Thank you.
Sophie!
Sophie, let's get up.
Careful with those.
A man died
not putting those on properly.
They went up his nose
and punctured his brain.
- That's not true.
- It is.
Happy birthday, Dad.
Thanks, darling.
Okay.
You're copying me?
All right, smart arse.
Attention!
- Oh, this what we're doing?
- Yeah, I tricked you!
- I'm still copying you though.
- I know.
Exactly.
Now copy this.
Breathe.
- Are you watching?
- Yeah.
Feet together. Up.
Up...
and down.
Up.
And...
Down.
Now close your eyes and do it.
And focus on your breathing.
That sulphur shit fucking reeks!
- What's that smell?
- It's where we go after this.
If it's good enough for Cleopatra...
It's kind of amazing
how Cleopatra was right here.
Yeah.
Before she was...
by a snake.
Well, it was kind of suicide.
It wasn't sure it was a snake.
Nobody found a snake.
- It might have been a needle.
- How do you know that?
We learnt about Egypt last term.
What happened to your shoulder?
I don't really know.
I'm sorry I passed out in your bed.
It's fine.
I didn't have a key though.
- How did you get in?
- Reception.
I'm so sorry, Soph. Yesterday was...
It's fine, it's no big deal.
No, it is a big deal.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, okay?
Thank you.
You've got none on your arm.
- I did.
- No, you don't.
Now you do.
- Let's see your back.
- My back?
Yep.
Right, I need to get a big clump
for this big back.
Careful with my shoulder.
It's okay.
Sorry!
Did you have fun last night?
Yeah.
This boy...
Michael...
I met him on the motorbike game.
Yeah.
We kissed, last night.
He kissed me
and then we kissed.
He's your age though?
Yeah.
Well, that's okay, right?
A peck on the cheek?
Well...
yeah, not exactly.
Okay.
You know, I want you to know
that you can talk to me about anything.
As you get older, you know?
Whatever parties you go to.
Boys you meet.
Drugs you take.
- Dad!
- No, I'm serious, Soph.
I've done it all, so can you too.
Promise me you'll talk to me about it.
Okay, but I'm never
gonna do any of that anyway.
That's okay, too.
But if you do, remember, okay?
On three,
we'll sing for my dad's birthday.
3, 2, 1!
- Should've gotten your own.
- I only wanted a taste.
There was half of it on your spoon.
Photo?
- How much?
- 50,000 lira.
Sure.
Ready?
- Teşekkür ederim.
- Rica ederim.
Did you have a good holiday?
The best.
Wish we could have stayed for longer.
Me too.
What?
I mean, why can't we?
What do you mean?
Why can't we just stay here?
Um...
Can't live in hotels
for the rest of our lives!
No.
- You can have the wafer.
- Oh, thank you very much!
I eat it in one, yes.
Too slow!
Last night, time for a dance.
- I don't dance.
- Sophie!
I never, ever dance.
I'm dancing with or without you.
I told you, I love to dance.
Dad, stop.
- So embarrassing.
- This is embarrassing?
Come on!
- Ready?
- Stop...
Stop!
- Bye-bye
- I love you.
- Safe travels.
- Bye-bye.
Give my love to your mum.
I don't need a babysitter, you know.
I love you.
Love you.
Bye.
